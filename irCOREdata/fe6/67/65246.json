By the time of its\ncompletion in 2008, the project will have been funded to the tune of some \u20ac400,000.\nThis article investigates Depardon\u2019s photographic \u2018Tour de France\u2019. Its aim in the first\ninstance is to explore the images of the country he has produced on his travels; but in\ndoing so, it addresses the broader set of questions raised by the project about the place\nof photography in the contemporary French cultural order. Firstly, it considers the\ncentral role ascribed to photography by the country\u2019s cultural and political institutions\nas a way of tracking and representing national identity and regional difference. Secondly,\nit investigates what the project reveals about Depardon\u2019s own place in France\u2019s cultural\nand photographic star system, as he transforms himself into an itinerant, state-sponsored\ninvestigator of that identity.\nKeywords: national identity; regional identity; space; travel; Mission France; DATAR\nIn 2004, the documentary photographer and filmmaker Raymond Depardon\nembarked on the first stage of a journey around France. This was to be no ordinary\ntour, however. Scheduled to last four years, the aim of Depardon\u2019s \u2018Mission France\u2019 is\nto produce what he describes as an \u2018\u00e9tat des lieux photographique du territoire\nfran\u00e7ais\u2019 [\u2018a photographic inventory of the French territory\u2019].1 The project is\nsignificant not only in terms of its scale and ambition \u2013 Depardon will attempt to\ncover the whole of the country during the period of the commission \u2013 but also in\nterms of the investment it represents. By the time of its completion in 2008, to be\nmarked by an exhibition in Paris, the project will have been funded to the tune of\n\u20ac200,000 by the French Ministry of Culture, with additional sponsorship of\n\u20ac200,000 coming from the French arm of HSBC bank. According to the Ministry of\nCulture, \u2018pour une commande publique individuelle et photographique, son ampleur\net sa dur\u00e9e sont exceptionnelles\u2019 (Guerrin 2004: 28) [\u2018It is rare for the government to\ncommission a project of this length and scope from a single individual, particularly\none which involves photography\u2019]. Yet this is not in fact the first time that the French\nstate has turned to photography as a means of exploring the nation and its identity.\nDepardon\u2019s photographic \u2018Tour de France\u2019 follows on from other similarly\ncomprehensive projects, the most notable of which was the \u2018Mission photographique\nde la DATAR\u2019.

It set out to portray a\nlandscape emerging from the twenty-year programme of urban and infrastructural\ndevelopment co-ordinated by the planning body. In the case of both the DATAR\nproject, and Depardon\u2019s own \u2018Mission France\u2019, the investment in photography is as\nmuch cultural as it is economic. It indicates a certain belief in the medium as a\npowerful and illuminating way to articulate and represent the nation and its spaces.\nMore especially, in the case of the \u2018Mission France\u2019, it indicates a belief in the\ndistinctive vision of Depardon\u2019s eye and his ability to reveal things about the country\nthat would otherwise remain invisible.\nWhile Depardon\u2019s \u2018mission\u2019 certainly remains unfinished at the time of writing,\nboth its modalities and its tensions have already been crystallized by the way in which\nthe project has unfolded in its first three years. My first aim in this article is thus to\nconsider the portrait of the nation which Depardon has begun to draw, and which has\ntaken shape in the series of exhibitions staged in regions he has already visited. I\nexamine in particular the insights it offers into the privileged and intricate\nrelationship between photography and national identity. But I go on to argue that the\nsignificance of his project lies in the conjunction of elements it brings together: the\ncombination of Depardon, France and photography is itself revealing of the role and\nstatus of photography in the contemporary French cultural order. Moreover, as we\nbegin to tease out the tensions inherent in Depardon\u2019s activity as an itinerant, state-\nsponsored investigator of national identity, we realize that it is a status which is not\nwithout its problems.\nPhotography, travel and national identity\nIn his well-known discussion of the formation of nation states and national identity,\nBenedict Anderson underlines the fundamental role played by print culture in\nfacilitating the spread of a common language across geographical space, and thereby\nhelping to establish among populations dispersed in various ways (geographically,\nsocially, ethnically) a sense of belonging to and participating in the same political\nentity (Anderson 1991: 37\u201346). The slow consolidation of the relationship between\nlinguistic identity and political identity, and the coalescence of those who share a\ncommon language into what he terms the \u2018imagined community\u2019 of the nation, was\nfinally enshrined by the French Revolution of 1789. For the first time, the leaders of\nthe new Republic defined national identity in terms of the ability and necessity of all\nthe country\u2019s citizens to speak a single language (Lodge 1993: 213\u201316). But since the\nnineteenth century, print culture has been supplemented \u2013 and arguably displaced by\n\u2013 visual culture in general, and by the photographic image in particular, as the\nprimary medium through which we are encouraged to imagine the polis and our\nplace within it. As Louis Kaplan notes, \u2018in the modern period \u2013 the period when both\nthe nation state and the medium of photography have been instituted and have\nflourished \u2013 photographic images have externalized and realized how we imagine\ncommunity, so it does not exist in the mind\u2019s eye alone\u2019 (Kaplan 2005: xv). While the\nsimultaneous development of the nation state and the photographic medium is in a\nsense coincidental (even if they both have their roots in the underlying processes of\nEdward Welch20\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 20\ntechnological, philosophical and political change which define the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries), the two quickly fall into a complex relationship. The\nphotographic image comes to play a vital role in the articulation and affirmation of\nthe nation state. It allows for the \u2018visual enactment\u2019 of the nation, to borrow David\nCampbell\u2019s term (2007: 380), a performative staging, or making visible, of the nation\nto and for itself. Essential to this process is the staging of the nation\u2019s spaces.\nSusan Buck-Morss (2002: 22) has observed that \u2018space has absolute priority in the\npolitical imaginary of nation states\u2019. The nation depends on its ability to assert and\nmaintain its spatial identity and unity, to define and protect the frontiers which give\nit that unity, and deploys a range of representational strategies in order to do so. While\nthe most well developed and sophisticated of these strategies is territorial mapping,\nphotography soon showed itself to be a particularly effective tool for the exploration,\nexpression and display of the spaces constituting the nation. The most obvious\nindication of this is the early emergence in the established and developing nation\nstates of Western Europe of a landscape tradition inherited from painting. Jens J\u00e4ger\nhas argued that if landscape photography quickly gained currency in nineteenth-\ncentury Britain, it was in large part thanks to an already well-established ideological\ninvestment in the notion of landscape as reflection or expression of the national\ncharacter (J\u00e4ger 2003: 118). And while, as he suggests in the case of Germany, the\nrelatively uneven spread of the tradition at the time was a sign that such ideologies\nwere less well developed in other national contexts, it is nevertheless the case that as\nthe nineteenth century progressed, landscape photography began to impose itself\ninternationally as the dominant mode in which the spaces of the nation were staged:\nits most obvious manifestation in the twentieth century is to be found in the\nlandscapes of Ansel Adams and their assertion of the epic scale of the United States.2\nTravel, of course, plays a central role in the recording and the shaping of a sense of\nspace. The very act of photographing the nation\u2019s landscapes, the physical displacement\nrequired in pursuit of them, enacts a sense of space and spatial diversity. Covering and\nsurveying the ground of the nation provide a set of co-ordinates which bring its spaces\ninto the purview and consciousness not only of the government, but also of the\nbroader community. Indeed, such photographic voyages are often carried out in the\nmode of exploration and adventure, an idea reflected in the term \u2018mission\u2019 which has\nbeen used to describe a number of such photographic expeditions in France, from the\n\u2018Mission h\u00e9liographique\u2019 of 1851, to the \u2018Mission photographique de la DATAR\u2019 and\nDepardon\u2019s own \u2018Mission France\u2019. They are journeys into the unknown, led by\nphotographers whose aim it is to bring to light new discoveries. Depardon himself\ndraws on the discourse of exploration and discovery to describe the aims of his latest\n\u2018mission\u2019: \u2018mon but est de donner \u00e0 voir les r\u00e9gions les moins fr\u00e9quent\u00e9es, celles que\nnous r\u00eavons de visiter un jour. Et de m\u2019approcher de celles que nous fuyons de peur de\nd\u00e9couvrir une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 moins romantique\u2019 [\u2018my aim is to bring to light less frequented\nparts of the country, places we might dream of visiting one day, and to investigate more\nclosely those we shy away from for fear of discovering a reality which is less romantic\u2019].3\nIn many ways, the expeditions undertaken by a number of photographers over the past\ndecades, whether it be Walker Evans in American Photographs (1938) or Robert Frank\nDepardon, France, photography 21\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 21\nin The Americans (1959), can be seen as the photographic equivalent of the road trip\nin cinema, insofar as the physical act of displacement in space, the journey into\nunknown territory, becomes a question not just of geographical but also of\nmetaphysical discoveries, of shifts in knowledge and understanding to be experienced\nnot just by them but by those who view their images.4\nIndeed, it is in the work of photographers such as Robert Frank where we can\nidentify the second mode in which the nation and national identity can be articulated\nand enacted, namely by foregrounding and portraying the people who constitute the\nnation and populate its spaces. The technique is exemplified in the French context by\nthe work in the 1940s and 1950s of so-called \u2018humanist\u2019 photographers such as\nRobert Doisneau and Willy Ronis. Despite the fact that their images typically focus\non a relatively narrow sector of the population at a specific time \u2013 the predominantly\nwhite working classes living in and around Paris in the postwar period \u2013 they have\ncome to have wide and enduring appeal, thanks in particular to popular presentations\nof their work which often serve to play out and reinforce established moral and social\nvalues, and encourage recognition and identification on the part of the viewer as they\ndo so.5\nThe relationship between photography and national identity also inevitably begins\nto implicate the nation state itself at some point, not least because, as Depardon\u2019s own\nproject would suggest, it is very often only the state which is in a position to finance\nany systematic or extensive photographic exploration of the spaces over which it has\ndominion. As John Tagg has argued, for example, the United States Farm Security\nAdministration (FSA) project of the 1930s, which mobilized a team of photographers\nto record the effects of the Great Depression on America\u2019s rural economy, can be\nunderstood in terms of the instrumentalization of documentary photography by the\nstate in order to negotiate a potentially catastrophic political crisis (Tagg 1988:\n153\u201383). Robert Hariman and John Louis Lucaites have discussed how certain\nimages from the FSA project, such as Dorothea Lange\u2019s \u2018Migrant mother\u2019 photo,\ncame to play a central role in the construction and management of civic identity and\ncivic responsibility in America by triggering processes of interpellation and\nrecognition in the viewing public (Hariman and Lucaites 2007: 53\u201367).\nLikewise, the history of modern France is punctuated at various points by a turn\nto photography on the part of the state and its institutions as a means by which\nnational identity can be articulated and asserted. Indeed, the Commission des\nmonuments historiques, an agency established by the French government in 1830 to\ninventory and safeguard the nation\u2019s architectural heritage, was quick to recognize the\npotential power of photography as it embarked on its task. Its second director, the\nwriter and historian Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, commissioned the \u2018Mission h\u00e9liographique\u2019\nfrom a pioneering group of photographers (including Gustave Le Gray and Henri Le\nSecq) in 1851. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s decision to send out a survey team to record and catalogue\nthe nation\u2019s patrimony was undoubtedly an acknowledgement of the benefits\nphotography could bring to scientific and archival endeavour; but the visualization\nand drawing together of the nation\u2019s monuments through photography could also\nserve as an effective reminder of its history and cultural heritage at a time when it was\nEdward Welch22\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 22\nliving through a period of political instability and the state was struggling to assert its\nlegitimacy. The material traces of the past gathered by the photographic survey act as\nvisible evidence that the nation, rather than being the result of an arbitrary\ncombination of lines on a map, has real historical and cultural substance.6\nIn other words, the relationship between photography and national identity is\nmore often than not a politicized one. To make a portrait of a nation is to make an\nintervention in the public sphere, to make public the state of the nation through\nphotography. And this is indeed how Depardon understands his mission. In an\ninterview with Michel Guerrin given at the start of the project, he aligns himself with\nthe American tradition of Walker Evans and Robert Adams rather than what he terms\nthe \u2018French school\u2019 of street photography (Guerrin notes that amongst the books\nDepardon has taken with him on his trip is a copy of Evans\u2019s American Photographs).\nThe American photographers, argues Depardon, were conscious of their place within\na broader national territory, and set out to portray the frameworks and structures they\nsaw around them (Guerrin 2004: 28). Like them, he says, his focus is on the territory\nof the nation, on the various ways in which the spaces of the nation have been\nmodelled and transformed, and on the relationship between those spaces and the\nhumans who have come to occupy them. In doing so, his aim is to reveal something\nabout the nation to his fellow citizens, to make them see something that has so far\nescaped them: \u2018\u00eatre politique, c\u2019est encore r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ce que l\u2019on ne voit plus\u2019 (Guerrin\n2004: 28) [\u2018to be political also means revealing what we can no longer see\u2019]. The\nquestion becomes, of course, what techniques are used in order to bring the nation to\nlight, and to reveal what can no longer be seen. At the same time, the project is also\ninhabited by an important tension, one faced by a number of photographers before\nhim; for while Depardon may lay claim in his project to a certain political freedom,\nthe right to cast over his country the independent eye of the artist, the project\u2019s status\nas a government commission risks placing it in a tradition which sees photography\ninstrumentalized by the state. In what ways might Depardon\u2019s mission negotiate or\nsuccumb to this tension?\nDepardon\u2019s France: politics, territory and visual enactment\nFrom the outset, Depardon insisted on the political and social context in which his\nmission would unfold: \u2018je constate, depuis quelque temps, que les Fran\u00e7ais vivent mal.\nIls sont malheureux, souffrent, parlent de taxes, de la d\u00e9gradation des relations\u2019\n(Guerrin 2004: 28) [\u2018I have noticed for some time that the French are not living well.\nThey are suffering and unhappy, talk about taxes and the about the breakdown in\nrelations between people\u2019]. His portrait of contemporary France would in many\nrespects be a portrait of a country in crisis. In 2004, the country was still coming to\nterms with the shock of seeing a Far Right candidate reach the second round of\npresidential elections in 2002, and it would express its discontent again with the\nrejection of the European constitution in a referendum in 2005. Yet while Depardon\u2019s\nconcern might be with the current mood of the French people, he makes the striking\ndecision at the start of the project to focus not on them, but on the spaces in which\nthey live: \u2018montrer le sol et le ciel, une France \u00e0 hauteur d\u2019homme. Pas des gens, car\nDepardon, France, photography 23\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 23\nils emp\u00eachent de voir une fa\u00e7on de vivre et une organisation sociale\u2019 (Guerrin 2004:\n28) [\u2018show the earth and the sky, France from the point of view of someone on the\nground. Avoid showing people though, because they prevent you from seeing ways of\nlife and social structures\u2019]. It is precisely by ignoring members of the nation\u2019s\ncommunity, by excluding them from the frame, suggests Depardon, that we can grasp\nmore clearly the ways in which their lives as part of that nation have been structured\nand organized.\nThe politics of Depardon\u2019s project is thus to be found in its exploration of the\nnature of space in contemporary France. His subject is what he terms \u2018le paysage\npolitique\u2019 (Guerrin 2004: 28), the notion of \u2018political landscape\u2019 understood for once\nhere in a literal rather than a figurative sense: the different ways in which the physical\nlandscape has been transformed by political action; the processes by which the nation\nhas shaped and inscribed the geographical space which it has claimed as its territory;\nand the often problematic relationship between the spaces it creates as a result and the\npeople who live in them. At stake in particular is the relationship between the local and\nthe national, and the way in which different localities are melded together to form a\nlarger geo-political entity. For as Depardon himself observes, \u2018ce bistrot, cette rue sont\nrattach\u00e9s \u00e0 quelque chose de plus grand, de central, qui s\u2019appelle un territoire\u2019 (Robert-\nDiard 2005: 14) [\u2018this caf\u00e9 and that street are part of something bigger, an overarching\norganization we call a territory\u2019]. His work draws our attention to the ways in which\nindividual places or locations are incorporated into the space of the nation, and carry\nthe traces of the broader frameworks and structures of which they are part.\nA preoccupation with the nature of space, and a desire to map and delineate space,\ncan in fact be seen as a recurring theme in Depardon\u2019s work. His filmic studies of\nhospitals (Urgences [1988] [Emergencies]), courts of law (10e chambre \u2013 Instants\nd\u2019audience [2004] [10th District Court]) and mental asylums (San Clemente [1982])\nreflect a Foucaldian concern with the institutional spaces and frameworks of human\nsocieties, and the relationship between individual subjects and the broader social and\nsymbolic structures which they inhabit and which constitute them. His desire to map\nthe territories of symbolic and discursive human action is echoed by a corresponding\ninterest in the nature of physical space, the ways in which humans have modelled,\nshaped and transformed the world around them, and the ways in which space is affected\nby time and change. He explores this interest most extensively in Errance (Depardon\n2000) [Wandering], a collection of images whose title foregrounds the itinerancy which\nis central to his activity as a documentary photographer. His sensitivity to the nature of\nhuman action on space is made clear in the opening sequence of images, which depict\nhighways making geometric incisions through otherwise pristine landscapes. At the\nsame time, Depardon also acknowledges his constant fascination with what he terms\n\u2018zones interm\u00e9diaires\u2019 (Depardon 2000: 142), that is to say, spaces of change and\ntransition, spaces where processes of change are particularly visible. Spaces such as these\nare once again the focus of his attention in the \u2018Mission France\u2019 project.\nFor the most part, the world he portrays is the provincial France of small- and\nmedium-sized towns in a largely rural setting. If he decides for the most part to avoid\nthe large towns and cities, it is because the provinces are where the tensions between\nEdward Welch24\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 24\ndifferent sorts of space are expressed most clearly. In the cities, he argues, the\nhomogenization of space is much more advanced: \u2018les grandes villes ne m\u2019int\u00e9ressent\npas: elles sont trop semblables, les centres-villes sont franchis\u00e9s, il y a partout les\nm\u00eames enseignes, les m\u00eames magasins et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, ce sont les m\u00eames banlieues\u2019 [\u2018I\nam not interested in the cities: they all resemble each other, with the same shop\nfranchises in the centre and the same suburbs on the outskirts\u2019].7 While his images\ncapture the numerous examples of regional architectural styles to be found in different\nparts of the country, such as the half-timbered housing of the Alsace, we soon become\naware of their coexistence with other sorts of space. Depardon draws attention in\nparticular to the uniform and geometric spaces which are an increasingly common site\non the edge of mature urban centres. With their standardized architecture of metal\nsheds housing supermarkets, shopping centres and light industrial units, these are the\ngeneric spaces of advanced capitalism, served by an equally generic infrastructure of\nroads, junctions and roundabouts which binds them to the transport network and\nenables them to function as part of the national economy.\nDepardon depicts one such space in a photo taken on the outskirts of Colmar in\nthe Alsace region. The foreground of the image is dominated by a collection of road\nsigns on the approach to a roundabout, with the town\u2019s boundary and identity\nindicated by the red-bordered rectangular sign which marks the entrance to every\ntown and village in France. To the left of the roundabout, and stretching back towards\nthe horizon, is the long, low windowless building of an electrical goods retailer; and\nthe relative newness of the space is further suggested by a sapling which takes up the\nforeground on the right-hand side of the image. Perhaps the most curious feature of\nthe scene is located on the roundabout itself, where stands a reproduction of the\nStatue of Liberty, unveiled in 2004 to mark the centenary of the death of Auguste\nBartholdi, its sculptor and a native of Colmar.\nWe are presented with a space which is standardized, with a road layout and street\nlighting which undoubtedly conform to national, or perhaps European, safety norms,\nyet at the same time is disorienting and vaguely sinister. In the first instance, this\nimpression is an effect of the composition of the image: the proliferation of verticals\n(street lamps, sign posts) scattered unevenly across the scene disrupt our attempts to\nread and comprehend the space before us. But a sense of unease is also to be found\nprecisely in the anonymity of the space, its reproducibility: were it not for the road\nsign indicating our arrival at Colmar, or perhaps the presence of the statue on the\nroundabout, it is unlikely that we would be able to identify the geographical location\nof this space with any certainty. It could be on the periphery of any town in the\ncountry. Even the presence of the statue, which is clearly intended to assert some sort\nof local specificity and civic identity, cannot be relied upon to perform that function\nfor those who are unaware of its relationship with Colmar. It is a landmark which is\nso strongly tied to a particular place, and whose symbolic meaning is so great, that it\nserves, ironically, to render the space in which it is transplanted even more abstract,\nand underline the degree to which it is disconnected from its context.\nOverall, Depardon\u2019s portrait of French territory leaves us with an impression not\njust of the uneasy coexistence of different sorts of space, but also of the steady\nDepardon, France, photography 25\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 25\nencroachment of generic or standardized space on older and more heterogeneous space\n\u2013 space in which the signs and traces of history have had time to accumulate. Thus, in\none image, we see a nineteenth-century calvaire, or wayside cross, stranded in the\nmidst of an industrial and retail park. It seems, therefore, that his staging of the nation\u2019s\nspaces invites us to acknowledge that the mood of malaise he perceives as he tours\nFrance may well have its origins in the collision of tradition and modernity which the\ncountry continues to negotiate, and stands as a critique of the obliteration of the\nparticular by the general, and the negation of the local by the national. Yet as the\nproject has taken shape and unfolded, its status as critical and political enactment of\nthe French nation has in fact been contradicted in a variety of surprising and revealing\nways by its reception and mediation on the ground. This contradiction can be traced\nto the problems posed, paradoxically, by photography\u2019s increasingly legitimate status\nwithin French culture, and the growing institutional pressures placed on it.\nCalling the tune: regional identity and recuperation\nDepardon\u2019s study can be understood first and foremost as an exploration of the\ntensions inhabiting the national space of France, and the ways in which national\nidentities and pressures impinge on and inflect the local. His peregrination around the\ncountry highlights the antagonistic relationship between the generic and the specific,\nand the gradual victory of the former over the latter. It is also intended to challenge\nthe dominant ways in which the spaces of the nation are imagined. Chief among these\nis a celebration of regional identities and characteristics, all of which are seen as\ncontributing to the richness of the national culture. Depardon sets out, as he puts it\nhimself, to \u2018d\u00e9jouer les fronti\u00e8res imaginaires \u2013 \u201cla fantastique Savoie\u201d, la \u201cBretagne\n\u00e9ternelle\u201d\u2026 \u00c0 ces poncifs r\u00e9pond une standardisation des esprits mais aussi du\nterritoire\u2019 (Guerrin 2004: 28) [\u2018call into question the country\u2019s imagined geography \u2013\n\u201cFantastic Savoie\u201d, \u201cEternal Brittany\u201d\u2026 These clich\u00e9s are contradicted by the\nstandardisation both of the territory and of mentalities\u2019]. It is ironic, therefore, that\nthe way in which the project has unfolded since its inception can in fact be seen to\nhave reasserted the dominant spatial ideologies at work in the French nation. In the\nfirst place, Depardon\u2019s examination of the relationship between the local and the\nnational has been played out precisely at the regional level. His mission has taken\nshape not only through his exploration of different parts of the country, but also\nthrough the staging of exhibitions in each of the regions he has visited. Moreover,\neach of these exhibitions has received promotion and financial support from the\nrelevant regional and local councils. As the project has been mediated and constructed\nat the regional level, the meanings and readings of his images have often come to be\ninflected in various ways. In the case of the Alsatian leg of the mission, for example,\nwe can see how the Press material which accompanied the exhibition oriented its\nreception around the themes of regional difference and specificity. In an interview\nwith the region\u2019s Press officer, Depardon celebrates the particular charms of the\nAlsace: \u2018j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 l\u2019Alsace tr\u00e8s bucolique, tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u00e0 vivre. Les Alsaciens sont les\ngens les plus gentils et les plus accueillants que j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9s sur le territoire\u2019 [\u2018I found\nEdward Welch26\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 26\nthe Alsace to be very pastoral, a very nice place to be. The people of the region have\nbeen the kindest and most welcoming of all those I\u2019ve met around the country\u2019].8\nA sense of regional identity is further reinforced by the images selected to represent\nthe exhibition. Most notably, the cover of the press pack is dominated by a colour\nphoto of a traditional Alsatian half-timbered house, in front of which is parked a\nCitro\u00ebn 2CV. This image permits a number of readings which facilitate its re-\ninscription within the dominant discourses of regional and national identity. On the\none hand, it can be seen to assert regional identity by emphasizing an architectural\nstyle which can be recognized without difficulty by the viewing public (both local and\nnational) as Alsatian; but on the other, the presence of the 2CV, a car which has\nbecome an icon of French engineering and design, simultaneously reminds the viewer\nof the region\u2019s place within a broader national framework \u2013 a reassertion of national\nidentity which is all the more important for a region whose place within the French\nnation has historically been far from secure. The visual and textual clues we are given\nby the exhibition\u2019s publicity material therefore encourage certain interpretations (a\ncelebration of Alsatian specificity which can be recognized within the context of a\nshared national culture and history, whose structuring presence is neatly symbolized\nby the fact that the 2CV is parked in front of the house) while other, more\nproblematic readings (those which might see the specific threatened by the generic)\nrecede into the distance.\nThe second way in which Depardon\u2019s project plays out the spatial ideologies of the\nnation is in its very journey around France. After having passed through the\nprovinces, it will conclude with a totalizing exhibition to be held in Paris, in which a\nselection of the images Depardon has accumulated will be displayed. In responding\nto the gravitational pull of Paris, Depardon acquiesces to the political, cultural and\nsocial hierarchy which reigns in France, orienting the nation around the capital as its\nbureaucratic nerve centre, and subordinating the provinces to it. Indeed, Depardon\nhimself seems only dimly aware of the logic in which he is caught up. In an interview\nwith regional television news to mark the opening of the Burgundy leg of the mission,\nDepardon expresses his pleasure that the local people have had a chance to see his\nphotos before they reach Paris;9 but what he fails to point out, of course, is that\nunless they take the trouble to go to Paris and visit the final show, they will be\ndeprived of the global vision of the nation which will be afforded to their fellow\ncitizens in the capital.\nFrance\u2019s Depardon: photography and the cultural order\nIn many ways, the tensions which have emerged as Depardon\u2019s mission has unfolded\n\u2013 and which have resulted in particular as his work has been mediated through the\ncultural and bureaucratic institutions of the French regions \u2013 can be traced to its\nambiguous position as a state-sanctioned and state-funded project. Yet at the same\ntime, and somewhat ironically, that position itself testifies to photography\u2019s relative\nsuccess in laying claim to artistic and cultural legitimacy in France in recent years.\nThis success can trace many of its roots to the DATAR project of the 1980s. As\nGa\u00eblle Morel has made clear, the DATAR project in effect served two legitimizing\nDepardon, France, photography 27\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 27\nfunctions. On the one hand, it provided a relatively new government agency the\nmeans to valorize both its activity and the outcome of that activity. On the other, it\nlent financial and institutional support to a practice which continued to occupy a\nmarginal position within the field of cultural production. It did so in particular by\ndefining itself from the outset as an explicitly artistic undertaking, and describing in\nauteurist terms the group of photographers who took part: their singular way of\nseeing the country would be central to the project\u2019s integrity (Morel 2006: 62\u20138; see\nalso Guigueno 2006).\nPerhaps the most significant difference between the DATAR project and the\n\u2018Mission France\u2019, separated as they are by twenty years, is the shift in emphasis from\nthe group to the individual. The DATAR project enabled photographers to lay claim\nto and consolidate their status as artists or auteurs. The fact that Depardon alone is\nresponsible for the \u2018Mission France\u2019 indicates not only that such a status now appears\nbeyond doubt, but also that the authorial perspective is deemed to have an inalienable\nvalidity. It would seem that the authority of the vision offered by the \u2018Mission France\u2019\nlies in its very singularity. The veracity of its portrait is guaranteed precisely by the fact\nthat the author of the work is Raymond Depardon, a photographer who, through his\nwork over the years, has managed to establish the singularity of his perspective, and\nhas had that singularity recognized and endorsed by a cultural order in which such an\nunderstanding of the creative act is at once paramount and for the most part\nunquestioned.\nSuch investment in, and reliance on, the visual powers of a single photographer\nsignals an important historical shift in our relationship to photography, and our\nunderstanding of its truth value. In the nineteenth century, as Schwartz and Ryan\nobserve, that relationship was defined above all by an investment in its powers of\nobjectivity (Schwartz and Ryan 2003: 3). The camera showed us what the exotic\nplaces to which adventurers travelled were \u2018really like\u2019. What counts now, very often,\nis less a sense of photography\u2019s objectivity than the uniqueness of a vision which can\nbe relied upon to see things that the rest of us cannot. Faith in the possibility that the\nphotograph allows us to see things as they \u2018really are\u2019 \u2013 a faith born out of our\ncontinued investment in the indexical qualities of the photographic image \u2013 arguably\nremains the common denominator of the two positions; but the guarantor of that\nvisual truth has come to be the operator of the apparatus as much as the apparatus\nitself, as if our Romantic faith in the power of the artist has overtaken our rationalist\nfaith in the power of the machine.\nYet simultaneously, and paradoxically, at the very moment at which we look to\nphotography to speak the truth about the world, we also find in it ways of\nmisrecognizing the world as it \u2018really is\u2019, of seeing the world how we imagine it or\nwant it to be, and all the more so if that world is living through a moment of crisis.\nAs the mediation and reception of Depardon\u2019s images of the Alsace would suggest, it\nis a function which Depardon, albeit despite himself, may well have come to fulfil\nthrough his \u2018Mission France\u2019; and in doing so, he will have revealed as much about the\nrole of photography within the French cultural order as he will about France itself.\nEdward Welch28\nJRS8_1_Inner_SB1:JRS8_1_Inner_SB1  5\/3\/08  09:16  Page 28\nNotes\n1.
