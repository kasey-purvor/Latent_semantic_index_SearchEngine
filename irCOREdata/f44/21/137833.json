Introduction \nPhilip and his colleagues (Knight et al., 1989; Philip, 1989a, b, 1990; Philip et al., \n1989a, b) reported analytical studies on the perturbation of vertical downward flow of \nwater around cavities in unsaturated soils.  Their work was concerned with the flow in \n\u201cGardner\u201d soils in which the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils is described \nby an exponential function of the soil-water pressure.  They showed that the shape of \nthe cavity was important as regards whether the cavity would exclude water (the sub-\ncritical condition) when the soil-water pressure on all parts of the cavity wall was less \nthan atmospheric.  The cavity would leak water (the super-critical condition) when the \nsoil-water pressure on a part of the cavity wall was greater than atmospheric.  A \ncritical shape exists when the soil-water pressure on all parts of the cavity wall is just \nless than atmospheric.  For two-dimensional tunnel cavities this shape is parabolic \n(Philip et al., 1989b). \nYoungs (2002) and Youngs et al. (2004) considered the critical shape of a tunnel \ncavity situated in the saturated capillary fringe of a Green and Ampt soil on top of a \n                                                 \n\u2217  Corresponding author. \n E-mail addresses: e.g.youngs@cranfield.ac.uk; anvar@squ.edu.om \n \nfreely draining gravel substratum.  The critical shape approximated to the parabolic \nshape predicted for Gardner soils, but was slightly smaller. They used conformal \nmapping to solve the two-dimensional problem of potential theory that describes the \nflow in the capillary fringe which, although at a negative soil-water pressure, is \nsaturated with a uniform hydraulic conductivity. \nYoungs\u2019 (2002) analysis assumes a horizontal upper boundary of the capillary fringe \nthat implies a non-uniform flux input over this surface, so that this is an \napproximation to the exact analysis for uniform accretion given by Youngs et al. \n(2004).  If, instead of the freely draining gravel substratum maintaining a water table \nat the base of the capillary fringe, a water table occurs in the soil above as a result of \nthe water-bearing permeable substratum being under pressure, it might be surmised \nthat a cavity spanning the water table would fill up to the level of the water table.  \nHowever, consideration of the effect that such cavities have on water flow show that \nthere are situations for which water is excluded.  Here we use Youngs\u2019 (2002) \nanalysis and show that it leads simply to the critical shape of tunnel cavities spanning \na water table that will not leak water.   \n \n2. The critical shape of tunnel cavities \n \nWe consider the situation of vertical downward flow of water through a capillary \nfringe in a uniform soil that overlies a very permeable, water-bearing stratum under \npressure.  In the absence of a cavity, with a vertical flow at a rate q the water table is \nat a height w above the substratum, given by \n \n'1 q\nPw a\u2212=          (1) \n \nwhere  is the pressure of the water in the substratum and q\u2019 = q\/K with K the \nhydraulic conductivity of the saturated soil that extends to the top of the capillary \nfringe.  The height of the capillary fringe H above the water table is \naP\n \n'1 q\nP\nH \u2212=          (2) \n \nwhere P (negative in value) is the air-entry value of the soil-water pressure at the top \nof the capillary fringe.  Thus if PPa = , w = H and the water table divides the \nsaturated flow region in half with the tension-saturated region above and the \ngroundwater under positive pressure below. \n \nWe now consider a tunnel cavity that spans the water table in the above situation.  We \nconsider separately the capillary fringe above, assuming this to be bounded at the top \nby a horizontal surface at height z = H where the soil-water pressure is P, and the \ngroundwater region below bounded at the bottom by the interface with a very \npermeable, horizontal substratum at depth z = w where the soil-water pressure is , \nwith \naP\nPPa = .  We consider further that the tunnel cavity is of critical shape when \nwater is just excluded from the cavity with the soil-water pressure on the cavity wall, \nwhich is a streamline, atmospheric. The boundary conditions are thus those shown in \nFig.1 where we see that the boundary conditions in the region above the water table \nare the same as those considered in Youngs\u2019 (2002) solution to the water exclusion \nproblem.  The potential distribution is symmetrical about the water table.  Thus, the \npotential and streamline patterns above and below the water table are thus given as a \nsolution of a free boundary problem for a holomorphic function by (Youngs, 2002)  \n \nK\n\u03c8i\u03c6\nt\nt\nPHK\n\u03c8i\u03c6\u03c0\n\u03c0\nPixy\nL\nL +\u2212\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+\n\u2212+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n+\n\u2212=\u2212 \u2212\n1\n)1(\n(\n(cos2\ncos)( 1    (3) \nwith the original of the coordinates (x,y) at the centre of the tunnel.

Discussion \n \nA general assumption in groundwater hydrology is that water will enter any cavity \ndug below the water-table level.  The analysis given here shows that this is not \nnecessarily the case when there is vertical seepage to a water-bearing substratum \nunder pressure.  A critical shape for water exclusion from a tunnel cavity that spans a \nwater table when the pressure of water in the substratum has the same value as the air-\nentry value of the soil, can be calculated using Youngs\u2019 (2002) analysis for critical \ncavity shapes situated above a freely draining permeable sub-stratum.  The critical \nshape is seen to be egg-shaped.  Increasing the cavities beyond the critical shape \nwould initiate water entry.  This work indicates that caution must be taken in \nassuming water-table levels in soils are shown by levels of water in excavated holes.  \nThis note addresses the problem of water exclusion from cavities in soils. It is \ninteresting to note that the boundary conditions for the flow in the region below the \nwater table in this problem are the same as those for the problem of seepage of water \nto a water-bearing substratum under pressure from infinite ponded-water regions \nseparated by a long island strip, so that the analysis given here applies also to this \ngroundwater problem and thus is of more general interest.   \n \n \nReferences \nKnight, J.H., J.R.
