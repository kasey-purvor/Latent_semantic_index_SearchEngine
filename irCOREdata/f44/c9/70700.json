Object Naming Footnotes 1  As a referee has correctly pointed out, a GSD could have an associative link to a representation of the typical colour for a category of object, and evidence from neuropsychology indicates this to be the case. However, notwithstanding the presence of such links, structural descriptions and colour will still be separately represented, allowing stored information about structure to be accessed selectively, without information about colour being accessed at the same time. Our argument is that the same selectivity is not an option when images are accessed, because images do not represent structure and colour separately, but rather in an integrated manner. In addition, of course, many object categories, especially artefacts, do not have a typical colour, so their GSDs will not be linked to representations of colour. 2  A count noun is a noun for a single entity, including objects (lamp) and mental entities (image), that can be counted. Hence, count nouns appear with indefinite articles in phrases refering to a single instance of a type of entity (a lamp), and in phrases refering to multiple instances of a type of entity (six lamps, many images). 3  With regard to why, when an orientation has to be specified for a category of object, certain orientations become preferred, we presume there are many contributing factors. Frequency of exposure to particular orientations would be the most obvious, though this cannot apply here. The ease with which the constituent geons can be discriminated from a particular orientation is claimed to be another factor. In addition, as a referee pointed out, the stability of an object in a particular orientation is likely to be another factor, in part because an unstable orientation is an unlikely orientation from which to encounter the same type of object in the future. Having said this, however, we might note the overwhelming tendency for people to draw bicycles in an unstable orientation (i.e., upright, and with no apparent support Object Naming being depicted). The functional significance of certain orientations also is likely to be very important. Thus, drinking mugs can only serve their usual function from a limited range of orientations, and they normally do this best when their handles are pointing to the viewer\u2019s right (so that a right-handed person can grasp the mug easily). We intend to run a study in which we explain an intended function for our novel object. In one condition, this function will require the object to be oriented with the attached part pointing down (e.g., so that indentations can be made in pastry). We then expect this orientation to become the preferred one, and the one towards which drawers will shift when object naming is combined with longer-term remembering. 4  A good illustration that object drawing can reveal the varying contributions of different types of visual representation according to memory delay is provided by a Bozeat et al.","cites":null},{"id":16389757,"title":"Influence of short-term memory codes on visual image processing: Evidence from image transformation tasks.","authors":[],"date":"1992","doi":"10.1037\/\/0278-7393.18.1.157","raw":"Brandimonte, M.A., Hitch, G.J., & Bishop, D.V.M.

This trend was \nreversed when participants were asked to depict the object in the orientation in which it had \nappeared to them. These results are discussed in relation to an account of the conditions \nunder which visual category representations become established and may be used \npreferentially over image-like visual representations. \n \nObject Naming              \n \n3\nObject Naming Induces Viewpoint-Independence in Longer-Term Visual \nRemembering: Evidence From a Simple Object Drawing Task \n Evidence is accumulating to suggest that short-term and longer-term visual \nremembering can rely on representations that preserve contrasting information about objects. \nFor example, compared to short-term remembering, longer-term remembering is more likely \nto utilise visual information about object categories than about specific objects (Avons & \nPhillips, 1987; Burgund & Marsolek, 2000; Marsolek, 1995), and information that specifies \nobject shape categorically rather than with metric accuracy (Rosielle & Cooper, 2001). It is \nless likely to utilise information about the specific viewpoints from which objects were \noriginally seen (Biederman & Cooper, 1991, 1992; Biederman & Gerhardstein, 1993; \nCooper, 1994; Cooper & Schacter, 1992; Ellis, Allport, Humphreys, & Collis, 1989; Seamon \n& Delgado, 1999; Seamon, Ganor-Stern et al., 1997; Stankiewicz & Hummel, 2002; \nStankiewicz, Hummel, & Cooper, 1998), or visual information about the colours of objects \n(Brandimonte, Schooler, & Gabbino, 1997; Cooper, 1994; Hitch, Brandimonte, & Walker, \n1995; Seamon et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1997). \n These contrasting aspects of objects, that are differentially associated with short-term \nand longer-term remembering, might be preserved in two distinct types of visual \nrepresentation. Candidate representations are images, such as those proposed by Tarr (e.g., \nTarr, 1995), and structural descriptions, such as the geon structural descriptions (GSDs) \nproposed by Biederman (e.g., Biederman, 1995). Images are object-specific, preserve \ninformation about the object\u2019s orientation in depth relative to the viewer, and are likely to \ncapture all the visible features of an object (e.g., its surface colour). In contrast, GSDs \nrepresent object categories at an intermediate level of abstraction, and focus on the shape of \ncategory relevant object parts in their spatial configuration, to the exclusion of information \nObject Naming              \n \n4\nabout an object\u2019s material properties (including colour).1  With shape being encoded \ncategorically, rather than with metric accuracy, GSDs are tolerant to the variation in shape \namong exemplars from a category. They are also largely insensitive to orientation in depth, \nand so can tolerate variations in the viewpoint from which an exemplar is observed. Perhaps, \ntherefore, it is because these different forms of representation are differentially associated \nwith short-term and longer-term remembering that information about contrasting aspects of \nobjects has varying relevance depending on memory delay. The proposal is not that short-\nterm and longer-term remembering are exclusively dependent on different types of \nrepresentation, but rather that, though both types of representation can support visual \nremembering in most situations, there is a tendency for longer-term remembering to rely on \nGSD-like structural descriptions when these are available.   \n If the various features of objects associated with longer-term visual memory are \npreserved in a single representation, then their involvement in visual remembering should be \nhighly correlated. For example, when participants appear to rely on visual category \nrepresentations in longer-term remembering, their performance should also confirm the \nviewpoint-invariance of these representations. Conversely, when participants are deprived of \nthe opportunity to rely on category representations, longer-term remembering should reveal \nthe same sensitivity to viewpoint that is observed in short-term remembering, because in both \ncases viewpoint-specific object representations will mediate performance. \n The experiment reported here was designed to assess this particular prediction. It did \nso by exploiting the impact object naming has on the creation of visual category \nrepresentations. Thus, naming novel objects with novel count nouns2 induces infants and \nyoung children to establish shape-based category representations for the objects (e.g., \nBaldwin, 1989; Hall, 1993; Hall & Moore, 1997; Hall, Quantz, & Persoage, 2000; Hall & \nObject Naming              \n \n5\nWaxman, 1993; Landau, 1994; Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1992; Waxman, 1999a; Waxman & \nBooth, 2001; Waxman & Hall, 1993), and it does so at an intermediate taxonomic level (Hall, \n1993; Hall & Waxman, 1993; Waxman, 1999a; Waxman & Hall, 1993; Xu, Carey, & Welch, \n1999). \n With this evidence in mind, the potential for a three-way association between longer-\nterm remembering, object categorisation, and viewpoint-independence was assessed by \nexamining the impact of object naming on visual memory for a novel object at varying \nmemory delays. It was expected that increasing evidence for viewpoint-independence would \nemerge with the shift from immediate to longer-term remembering, but only when the object \nwas named, because only then would a visual category representation for the object be \nestablished. \n A simple drawing task was employed to determine if object naming and memory \ndelay combine to increase the viewpoint-independence evident in adults\u2019 drawings of a novel \nobject from memory. Participants drew a novel object from immediate, short-term, or longer-\nterm memory. Prior to drawing, the object was presented for inspection from a single \nviewpoint, at which time the experimenter either named the object with a novel count noun, \nor did not name it. The restricted viewpoint from which participants inspected the object was \nnot one from which participants would normally depict the object. Depicting the object from \na viewpoint other than this restricted viewpoint was to be taken as evidence for viewpoint-\nindependence in visual remembering. No constraints were placed on how participants were to \ndraw the object, and in particular, whether they should draw it in the orientation from which \nit had been seen by them (e.g., participants were simply instructed to \u2018Draw the dax\u2019 or \n\u2018Draw the first\/second object\u2019). It was predicted that the combined effect of naming the novel \nobject at presentation and testing longer-term remembering, would be to increase the \nObject Naming              \n \n6\nviewpoint-independence evident in participants\u2019 drawings, as revealed by a reduced tendency \nto depict the object from the restricted viewpoint from which it had been seen. Finally, to \ncheck if participants in this condition could still remember how the object had appeared to \nthem, an additional control condition was run where participants were specifically asked to \ndraw the object in the orientation in which it had appeared to them. \nMethod \nParticipants  \n One hundred and sixty one students at Lancaster University, aged between 18 and 32 \nyears, completed the experiment. They were not paid for their participation. \nMaterials  \n Two novel objects were constructed out of wood. They each comprised an 18 cm \ncube, with a smaller wooden part attached to the centre of one face. For one object, the \nattached part was a pyramid, with an 11 cm square base and a vertex of 10 cm. For the other \nobject, the attached part was a 7.5 cm diameter sphere.  \nDesign  \n A 3x2 independent-groups design was created by crossing two factors. The factors \nwere Memory Delay (immediate, short-term, and longer-term remembering) and Object \nNaming (object named versus object unnamed). An equal number of participants (n = 23) \nwas assigned randomly to each of these six groups. An additional, control group of \nparticipants (n = 23) was assigned to a longer-term remembering with object naming \ncondition, with the constraint that they should depict the object in the orientation it had \nappeared to them. The groups had similar mean ages and male:female ratios. For the object \nnamed conditions, the mean ages (in years) and male:female ratios (in parentheses) were 19.8 \n(5:18), 19.4 (4:19), 19.7 (6:17), and 20.3 (4:19), for the immediate, short-term, longer-term, \nObject Naming              \n \n7\nand longer-term control conditions, respectively. The corresponding values for the object \nunnamed conditions were 19.6 (4:19), 20.4 (5:18), and 19.7 (5:18), for the immediate, short-\nterm, and longer-term conditions, respectively. Only four of the participants drew with their \nleft-hand (one male in each of the immediate remembering with object naming and longer-\nterm remembering with object naming conditions, and one female in each of the immediate \nremembering without object naming and short-term remembering without object naming \nconditions). \nProcedure  \n Each object in turn was presented for visual inspection for 20 s, and then immediately \nremoved from sight for the remainder of the experiment (see Figure 1). In all conditions, \nbetween presentation of the two objects, participants engaged in a visual imagery task for 1 \nmin. This was intended to ensure participants were unable to hold the first object in mind by \ncontinually visualising it (cf. Phillips, 1983, for discussion of the link between visualisation \nand visual memory). The imagery task was taken from Finke, Pinker, and Farah (1989), and \nrequired participants to imagine transforming and combining two letters of the alphabet to \ndiscover an emerging object. In the immediate memory condition, participants were asked to \ndraw the second object immediately after it had been removed. In the short-term and longer-\nterm memory conditions, after the second object had been inspected and removed from view, \nparticipants were asked to engage in the imagery task for a second time, again for 1 min. In \nthe short-term memory condition, participants were then asked to draw the second object. In \nthe longer-term memory condition, they were asked to draw the first object. The order of \npresentation of the two objects was arranged to ensure that it was always the object with the \npyramid attachment that was drawn. Thus, whereas this object was the first object to be \npresented in the longer-term memory condition, it was the second object to be presented in \nObject Naming              \n \n8\nthe immediate and short-term memory conditions. This object was always inspected by \nparticipants from a restricted view. Specifically, the experimenter held the object in front of \nthe participant with the attached part always pointing down. Previous research has shown that \nthis is rarely an orientation in which this type of object will be drawn after it has been seen \nfrom all major viewpoints (cf., Walker et al., 2006). Viewing of the other object was \nunrestricted, with the experimenter rotating the object in front of the participant following a \ncarefully rehearsed routine that exposed the object equally from every major viewpoint. \nParticipants did not know in advance which object they would be asked to draw, or how they \nwould be asked to draw it. In the object named condition, as the experimenter presented each \nobject for inspection, she named it using one of two novel count nouns (i.e., \u201cThis is a \nriff\/dax. Please look at this riff\/dax.\u201d) A different label was assigned to the two objects. \nWhen later requesting participants in this condition to draw one of the objects, she said \u201cDo \nyou remember the first\/second object? It was a riff\/dax. Please now draw it for me.\u201d In the \nobject unnamed condition, as the experimenter presented each object for inspection, she said \n\u201cThis is an object. Please look at this object.\u201d When later requesting participants in this \ncondition to draw one of the objects, she said \u201cDo you remember the first\/second object? \nPlease now draw the first\/second object for me.\u201d In the additional control condition, which \ncombined longer-term remembering and object naming, the experimenter requested \nparticipants to draw the first object in the orientation in which it had appeared to them, saying \n\u201cDo you remember the first object? It was a riff\/dax. Please now draw it for me in the \norientation in which it had appeared to you.\u201d \nResults \n The view from which the object was depicted in each drawing was assessed by a \ncolleague who was ignorant of the purpose of the study and of the conditions under which \nObject Naming              \n \n9\neach drawing had been produced. In every case, it was clear that the attached part had been \nincluding in the drawing, and in which direction the object (i.e, the attached part) was \npointing. \n Figure 2 presents the number of drawings in each condition where the object was \ndepicted either from the restricted viewpoint from which it had been seen, or from some other \nviewpoint. For all statistical analyses, an alpha level of .05 was adopted. \n Changes in the likelihood of depicting the object from the restricted viewpoint, versus \nsome other viewpoint, confirmed the combined impact of object naming and memory delay. \nAggregating across levels of memory delay, there were significantly more drawings in the \nobject named condition, than in the object unnamed condition, that depicted the object from a \nviewpoint other than the one from which it had been seen, Fisher\u2019s Exact p = .002.  In the \nobject unnamed condition, the likelihood of depicting the object from the restricted viewpoint \ndid not change as memory delay was extended, Linear-by-Linear Association (1, N = 69)  = \n0.76, p = .385. In the object named condition, the likelihood of depicting the object from the \nrestricted viewpoint decreased as memory delay was extended, Linear-by-Linear Association \n(1, N = 69)  = 21.25, p < .001. Two separate analyses of the results from the object named \ncondition confirmed that the likelihood of depicting the object from the restricted viewpoint \ndecreased significantly with both the transition from immediate to short-term remembering, \nFisher\u2019s Exact p = .023, and with the transition from short-term to longer-term remembering, \nFisher\u2019s Exact p = .009. Neither of these transitions had a significant impact in the object \nunnamed condition, Fisher\u2019s Exact p = .61 and .19, for the immediate to short-term and \nshort-term to longer-term transitions, respectively. \nObject Naming              \n \n10\n The results from the longer-term remembering control condition were clear. Despite \nhaving heard the experimenter name the object, all the participants drew the object in the \norientation in which it had appeared to them. \nDiscussion \n The results confirm that with the transition from immediate to longer-term \nremembering, object naming reduces the likelihood that participants will be constrained to \ndepict a remembered object from the viewpoint from which it had been seen. Given the \nevidence linking object naming with object categorisation, this result is consistent with the \nproposal that two distinct types of visual representation are differentially associated with \nshort-term and longer-term remembering. More specifically, though both image-like and \nGSD-like representations can support remembering across a full range of circumstances, \nthere is a tendency for longer-term remembering to utilise GSD-like representations when \nthese are available. Object naming can be a critical factor determining the availability of \nGSD-like representations and, because of this, the extent to which visual remembering is \nviewpoint-independent.3 \n Walker et al. (2006) also have shown that naming a similar novel object (a cube with \na cone attachment) with a novel count noun can impact on young children\u2019s drawings of the \nobject. In their study, however, the object remained available for inspection during drawing. \nSpecifically, after it had been shown to the children from every major angle, it was placed in \nposition for drawing with the cone hidden from view (i.e., pointing directly away from the \nchildren). It is known that young children are inclined to depict an object part that is currently \nhidden from view (e.g., Freeman & Janikoun, 1972), and such intellectual realism can be \nseen as another example of viewpoint-independence in drawing. It is relevant to note, \ntherefore, that Walker et al. confirmed that if the object was labelled with a novel count noun \nObject Naming              \n \n11\nas it was being inspected prior to drawing, the likelihood that the children would be \nconstrained by the viewpoint from which they could see the object was reduced. When the \nobject was named, the children showed an increased tendency to depict the object from a \nviewpoint that revealed the hidden part, but only if the name chosen indicated that this part \nwas category relevant. In the present context, these results confirm that, despite their \ndifferential association with longer-term remembering, visual object category representations \ncan impact on live drawing (i.e., drawing an object that remains available for inspection). It \nseems, therefore, that when young children engage in live drawing, they behave as if they \nwere adults drawing from longer-term visual memory. \n According to the current proposal, whenever a task requires participants to refer to \nthose aspects of an object that are best preserved in an image-like representation, object \nnaming will have the potential to impact negatively on performance, especially if this \ninvolves longer-term, rather than short-term, remembering. The task might require \nparticipants to draw an object from its current viewpoint, or from the viewpoint from which it \nwas last seen. Alternatively, it might require them to reproduce the colour and shape of the \nobject with high fidelity.  \n Detrimental effects of object naming on longer-term visual remembering have already \nbeen demonstrated in studies of visual image combination (cf. Brandimonte, Hitch, & \nBishop, 1992; Hitch, Brandimonte, & Walker, 1995; Walker et al., 1997). In these studies, \nparticipants were asked to combine a visual image of a recently presented line drawing with \nan image of a current line drawing. They were then to discover the identity of the object \nresulting from this combination. The nature of the to-be-combined drawings required the \nsuperimposition of the two images in the mind\u2019s eye to be metrically accurate. In some \nsituations, the recently presented visual stimulus was either still available in short-term \nObject Naming              \n \n12\nmemory (because no other item had been presented in the interim), or it was available only in \nlonger-term memory (because other task-relevant items had been presented in the interim). In \naddition, it was arranged that when the memory item depicted a familiar object, it was either \nnamed or unnamed at presentation. In agreement with the results of the present study, \nparticipants were less able to complete the image combination task if the object depicted in \nthe first drawing was named at presentation. Moreover, this detrimental effect of naming was \nobserved only with longer-term remembering, and not with short-term remembering. Walker \net al. (1997) proposed that performance was impaired by object naming because this induced \nparticipants to increase their reliance on a visual representation of the category to which the \nobject belonged, with the effect that the shape of the object became less accurately described \n(i.e., there was a shift towards shape being described categorically rather than with metric \naccuracy). Finally, additional support for the current proposal emerged with the observation \nthat performance in the image combination task was insensitive to the colour congruity of the \nto-be-combined stimuli, but only when longer-term remembering was being assessed and the \nfirst figure had been named (Hitch, Brandimonte, & Walker, 1995; Walker et al., 1997). With \nshort-term remembering, image combination was impaired when the two figures to be \ncombined appeared in different colours (e.g., black-on-grey and white-on-grey), rather than \nthe same colour (e.g., both black-on-grey), regardless of whether or not the first figure was \nnamed. In other words, whereas the visual representation supporting longer-term \nremembering resembled a GSD-like representation insofar as it did not preserve object \ncolour, the visual representation supporting short-term remembering resembled an image-like \nrepresentation insofar as it preserved object colour independently of object naming. \n Much of the evidence confirming the impact of distinct types of visual representation \nin longer-term remembering has involved the contrast between implicit and explicit tests of \nObject Naming              \n \n13\nmemory (see, for example, Cooper, 1994, and Srinivas, 1996). For example, though longer-\nterm priming in both object naming and the possible-impossible object decision task has been \nshown to involve visual representations that do not preserve information about viewpoint and \nobject colour, explicit recognition memory for the same stimuli has been shown to involve \nvisual representations that do preserve information about these two features (Biederman & \nCooper, 1991, 1992; Cooper, 1994; Cooper & Schacter, 1992; Seamon & Delgado, 1999; \nSeamon et al., 1997; Srinivas, 1996). Clearly, therefore, a full account of the representational \nbasis of visual remembering, and of the moderating influence of object naming, will need to \nacknowledge the distinction between implicit and explicit tests of memory. Nevertheless, the \npresent results confirm that, as an explicit test of memory, object drawing tasks can reveal the \nvarying contributions of different types of visual representation and the moderating influence \nof object naming.4 \n Figure 3 illustrates the conceptual framework developed here to accommodate the \nresults of the present study and related findings (e.g., Hitch, Brandimonte & Walker, 1995; \nWalker et al., 1997). It is proposed that when an object is encountered, distinct visual \nprocesses support the derivation of the two types of visual representation. These are labelled \nsimply as type A and type B processes, so as to remain mute regarding their nature.5  It is \nassumed that image-like visual representations are always established, whereas certain \nconditions have to be satisfied for a visual category representation to be established. \nCombining object naming (i.e., naming a novel object with a novel count noun in the present \nstudy) with longer-term remembering creates a sufficient condition for this to occur. These \ntwo component conditions are seen to impact on different aspects of the cognitive resources \nsupporting object drawing. Whereas object naming facilitates the derivation of a visual \ncategory representation, longer-term remembering increases the likelihood that this \nObject Naming              \n \n14\nrepresentation will be used to support performance. Neither of these component conditions is \nthought to be necessary for a category representation to impact on performance. Indeed, \nBiederman and Bar (1999) and Coltheart, Mondy, and Coltheart (2005) have revealed that, \non the basis of encountering a single view of a novel object, a viewpoint-independent visual \nrepresentation can be established quickly, even in the absence of object naming. And in their \nstudies of viewpoint-independent visual priming in the possible-impossible object decision \ntask, Schacter and Cooper have revealed a number of visual encoding conditions, other than \nobject naming, that lead to the derivation of viewpoint-independent structural descriptions of \nnovel objects (e.g., deciding if a novel object depicted in a simple line drawing faces left or \nright, deciding how the object might be used as a tool, or deciding if the object resembles an \nitem of household furniture) (Schacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter, Cooper, & Delaney, 1990). \nSchacter and Cooper argue that the need to derive a global structural description of the novel \nobject is common to all encoding conditions yielding viewpoint-independent visual priming.  \n It is proposed that image-like representation(s) do not become unavailable or \ninaccessible when a visual category representation is established. Indeed, even when naming \nwas combined with longer-term remembering in the control condition of the present study, \nparticipants were able to draw the critical object in the restricted viewpoint from which it had \nbeen seen when asked to do so. Brandimonte, Schooler, and Gabbino (1997) also have shown \nthat the detrimental effects of object naming in longer-term visual remembering can be \nreversed by providing colour as a visual cue to facilitate access to the original visual \nrepresentation. And in an earlier study of verbal overshadowing, Schooler and Engstler-\nSchooler (1990) demonstrated that requiring participants to make their face recognition \njudgements quickly removed the verbal overshadowing effect, confirming that the original \nvisual representation of the face had not been eradicated when participants provided a verbal \nObject Naming              \n \n15\ndescription of the face. Finally, Schacter and colleagues (e.g., Cooper & Schacter, 1992; \nSchacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter, Cooper & Delaney, 1990) and Burgund and Marsolek \n(2000) have confirmed that viewpoint-specific and viewpoint-independent visual \nrepresentations can co-exist in memory, and that particular task conditions can determine \nwhich type of representation impacts on performance (e.g., whether the test stimulus is \npresented directly to the left or right cerebral hemisphere).   \n Although the focus has been on viewpoint in the present study, the conceptual \nframework being proposed implies that other visual features will correlate with object \nnaming and longer-term remembering. It is predicted that whenever conditions are such as to \nencourage the drawer to rely on an image-like representation, their drawings will be more \nlikely to reflect object shape with metric accuracy, and to reproduce the object\u2019s material \nproperties (e.g., surface texture and colour). Conversely, these features will be less apparent \nwhen conditions are such as to encourage the drawer to rely on a GSD. Further work is \nrequired to assess these predictions, and to see if these other features of drawings will co-\noccur with viewpoint-dependence.  \n When a person names a familiar object with its category label, they are required to \ncategorise the object visually, and in many situations this in turn will require them to derive a \nstructural description. But why should hearing someone else name a novel object with a \nnovel count noun induce a person to visually categorise the object? That it should do so is \noften assumed in discussions of language acquisition. According to Waxman (1999), for \nexample, object naming by someone else (typically by an adult, who also gestures towards \nthe object) is perceived by young children to be an act of object categorisation, encouraging \nthe children themselves to categorise the object. In this way, children learn to associate a \nvisual representation of the object\u2019s category with a verbal representation of the name \nObject Naming              \n \n16\nprovided by the adult, which typically is the name of the object\u2019s category. The claim being \nmade here is that these processes, which are so important in early language development, \nremain influential in later life. Thus, just like young children, adults who hear an \nexperimenter name a novel object with a novel count noun also perceive the experimenter to \nbe categorising the object and also, therefore, are induced to derive a visual category \nrepresentation for the object. On this account, verbal recoding has a significant impact on \nvisual information processing, including visual remembering, even when it is someone else \nwho is heard to do the verbal recoding.  \n Verbal overshadowing. Much of the work on verbal overshadowing has focused on \nusing faces as stimuli, has required participants to provide verbal descriptions of the faces, \nand has then examined the impact of this on explicit, forced-choice visual recognition \nmemory for the faces. Of course, providing a verbal description of an item is not the same as \nnaming it, and faces are a distinct class of stimuli with distinct systems of visual \ncategorisation. Despite these differences, however, it is worth reflecting on some implications \nof the conceptual framework presented here for studies of verbal overshadowing. \n The first point to make is that because distinct forms of visual processing support the \nderivation of distinct types of representation, the present conceptualisation allows either the \ntype of encoding, or the type of representation, to be emphasised in accounts of verbal \novershadowing. That is, explanations of overshadowing based on representational \ncompetition (e.g., Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990) are not incompatible with \nexplanations based on the transfer of inappropriate processing (e.g., Schooler, 2002). \n A second point to make relates to the fact that early accounts of verbal overshadowing \nemphasise the contrast between verbal and visual representations of the same item, and how \nthe relative utility of these forms of representation varies according to context. Accordingly, \nObject Naming              \n \n17\nthese accounts require that the foils for the recognition test are selected carefully, so that it is \nclear if, and to what extent, recognition can be supported by verbal representations. If it \ncannot, because the target and foils share similar verbal descriptions, then any verbal \novershadowing that occurs will have to be explained without reference to the \navailability\/accessibility of verbal representations. The present conceptualisation indicates \nthat it is also important to know the extent to which visual recognition can be supported by \nvisual category representations, and again the nature of the foils is critically important. To \ngive one example, if all the foils were to share the same basic geon structural description as \nthe target, then visual category representations would be precluded from supporting visual \nrecognition memory, which instead would have to rely exclusively on visual representations \nthat are capable of discriminating among examplars from the same visual category (i.e., rely \non visual images).   \n Studies of the impact of verbal recoding on visual image manipulation were designed \nto preclude verbal representations from mediating performance, so that interest could be \nfocussed on alternative forms of visual representation and their differential association with \nobject naming and memory delay (see, for example, Hitch et al., 1995, & Walker et al., \n1997). But is performance in the current object drawing task supported exclusively by visual \nmemory representations, or can verbal representations make a contribution? In principle, \nverbal representations have the potential to support object drawing. However, it is important \nto note that the novel count noun assigned to the object participants in the present study had \nto draw carried no information about the nature of the object, and so could not contribute \ndirectly to drawing.  \n A final point to make is that unconstrained verbal descriptions can include the names \nof different types of visual category to which an item belongs, although they need not. \nObject Naming              \n \n18\nIndeed, in some studies of verbal overshadowing, participants have been instructed to include \ncategory labels in their descriptions (e.g., personality type, occupational category, age group, \ngender, weight category, and hair colour). However, control over the inclusion of category \nlabels is not normally exercised, nor are the foils for the recognition test selected with the \npotential utility of category representations in mind. Uncertainty often remains, therefore, \nregarding the involvement of category representations in supporting visual recognition \nmemory. From a purely procedural point of view, therefore, the present conceptual \nframework, and the success of the present study, indicates that there might be considerable \nmerit in providing participants with a verbal description, rather than asking them to generate \ntheir own. The fact that the description is provided by someone else might not be critical, \nallowing control to be exercised over the nature of the verbal description that might lead to \nverbal overshadowing.  \nObject Naming              \n \n19\nReferences \nAvons, S.

However, notwithstanding the presence of such \nlinks, structural descriptions and colour will still be separately represented, allowing stored \ninformation about structure to be accessed selectively, without information about colour \nbeing accessed at the same time. Our argument is that the same selectivity is not an option \nwhen images are accessed, because images do not represent structure and colour separately, \nbut rather in an integrated manner. In addition, of course, many object categories, especially \nartefacts, do not have a typical colour, so their GSDs will not be linked to representations of \ncolour. \n2  A count noun is a noun for a single entity, including objects (lamp) and mental entities \n(image), that can be counted. Hence, count nouns appear with indefinite articles in phrases \nrefering to a single instance of a type of entity (a lamp), and in phrases refering to multiple \ninstances of a type of entity (six lamps, many images). \n3  With regard to why, when an orientation has to be specified for a category of object, \ncertain orientations become preferred, we presume there are many contributing factors. \nFrequency of exposure to particular orientations would be the most obvious, though this \ncannot apply here. The ease with which the constituent geons can be discriminated from a \nparticular orientation is claimed to be another factor. In addition, as a referee pointed out, the \nstability of an object in a particular orientation is likely to be another factor, in part because \nan unstable orientation is an unlikely orientation from which to encounter the same type of \nobject in the future. Having said this, however, we might note the overwhelming tendency for \npeople to draw bicycles in an unstable orientation (i.e., upright, and with no apparent support \nObject Naming              \n \n25\nbeing depicted). The functional significance of certain orientations also is likely to be very \nimportant. Thus, drinking mugs can only serve their usual function from a limited range of \norientations, and they normally do this best when their handles are pointing to the viewer\u2019s \nright (so that a right-handed person can grasp the mug easily). We intend to run a study in \nwhich we explain an intended function for our novel object. In one condition, this function \nwill require the object to be oriented with the attached part pointing down (e.g., so that \nindentations can be made in pastry). We then expect this orientation to become the preferred \none, and the one towards which drawers will shift when object naming is combined with \nlonger-term remembering. \n4  A good illustration that object drawing can reveal the varying contributions of different \ntypes of visual representation according to memory delay is provided by a Bozeat et al. \n(2003). They presented geometric designs and pictures of familiar objects to patients with \nsemantic dementia. They asked the patients either to copy the pictures, or to draw them some \ntime after they had been removed from view. With regard to the pictures of familiar objects, \nthe patients produced good copies, but their drawings after a delay were much less good. In \naddition, the quality of an individual patient\u2019s delayed drawings was correlated with the \nseverity of their dementia, and with the quality of the drawings they produced of the same \nobjects in response to being given their names. There was no unusual deterioration with delay \nin their drawings of the geometric designs. The point to note in the context of the present \nstudy is that whereas immediate object drawing was uninfluenced by category representations \nin long-term memory, and hence by the dementia, delayed object drawing was. \n5  It is beyond the scope of the present paper to explore either the nature of the processes \nrequired to derive each type of visual representation, or the interdependencies between them. \nThough they are likely to share very early visual encoding pathways, it is not clear at what \nObject Naming              \n \n26\npoint they dissociate. It is also unclear if the processes dissociate to operate in parallel of each \nother, as illustrated in Figure 3, or if the processes responsible for deriving a viewpoint-\nindependent structural description follow in sequence those responsible for deriving the \ncorresponding viewpoint-specific image(s).  \n \n \n \nObject Naming              \n \n27\nFigure Captions \nFigure 1.

The conceptual framework developed to accommodate the results of the present \nstudy and related findings. The information provided by the two types of visual \nrepresentation is depicted as converging on common production mechanisms. This is \nintended to reflect the fact that a single drawing need not be based exclusively on one \ntype of representation, but can be based on a mix of representations, including viewpoint-\nspecific object representations and category representations (for evidence, see Walker et \nal., 2006).  \nObject Naming              \n \n28\nfiller object rotated \nthrough all views\ncritical object fixed \nin restricted view\nfirst \nimagery \ntask\ndraw critical \nobject\nfiller object rotated \nthrough all views\ncritical object fixed \nin restricted view\nfirst \nimagery \ntask\nsecond \nimagery \ntask\ndraw critical \nobject\nIMMEDIATE MEMORY\nSHORT-TERM MEMORY\nLONGER-TERM MEMORY\nfiller object rotated \nthrough all views\ncritical object fixed \nin restricted view\nfirst \nimagery \ntask\nsecond \nimagery \ntask\ndraw critical \nobject\nFigure 1  \nObject Naming              \n \n29\n \n \n \n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n  8\n  6\n  4\n  2\n  0\nIMM LTMSTM IMM\nObject Unnamed\nrestricted view\nother views\nSTM LTM\n22\nObject Named\nFigure 2\nLTM\ncontrol\n \nObject Naming              \n \n30\nvisual object \nrepresentation \n(image)\nvisual category \nrepresentation \n(geon structural \ndescription)\ntype A visual \nprocessing\ntype B visual \nprocessing\nDRAW\nvisual object \nrepresentation \n(image)\ntype A visual \nprocessing\nDRAW\nWITHOUT OBJECT NAMING\nWITH OBJECT NAMING\n\u201cThis is a dax\u201d\nobject category \nnames \nimmediate \ndrawing\ndelayed \ndrawing\nFigure 3  \n"}
