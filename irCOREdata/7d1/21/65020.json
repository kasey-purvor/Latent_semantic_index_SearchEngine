A large amount of onshore and offshore\ngeological evidence from the Lambert-Amery\nsystem highlights the nature, but not the caus-\nes, of major changes in ice dynamics and off-\nshore sedimentation since Eocene time (Stagg,\n1985; Mizukoshi et al., 1986; Barron et al.,\n1991; Cooper et al., 1991; Kuvaas and Leitch-\nenkov, 1992; O\u2019Brien et al., 2001).\nWithin the broader context of cooling from\nan ice-proximal fjordal setting to the estab-\nlishment of today\u2019s polar ice shelf (Hambrey\n*Corresponding author: m.j.siegert@bristol.ac.uk.\net al., 1991; Hambrey and McKelvey, 2000a,\n2000b), an ice stream was established in\nPrydz Bay during late Miocene\u2013early Pliocene\ntime, in association with a major offshore de-\npocenter (O\u2019Brien and Harris, 1996; O\u2019Brien\net al., 2001; Fig. 1A). The ice sheet subse-\nquently withdrew to its present position, leav-\ning the Amery Ice Shelf to cover much of the\ntrough. More recently, the East Antarctic Ice\nSheet failed to reach the continental shelf\nbreak during the Last Glacial Maximum\n(LGM) (Domack et al., 1998).\nThe specific reasons for any of these major\nchanges in the Lambert region are unclear, be-\nyond being related to broad-scale changes in\ntectonics, climate, and oceanography. De-\nConto and Pollard (2003) demonstrated the\nimportance of atmospheric forcing in estab-\nlishing glaciation in Antarctica and the use of\nnumerical ice-sheet modeling in testing ideas\non ice-sheet evolution. We use a numerical\nmodeling approach to test the hypothesis that\nchanges in East Antarctic Ice Sheet configu-\nration (i.e., its extent and flow pattern) during\nthe past ;20 m.y. have been driven primarily\nby alteration of tectonic structure or erosional\ntopography rather than variations in climate or\nice-sheet mass balance. Our work follows pre-\nvious well-known investigations of the bed\ncontrol on ice-sheet extent (e.g., Hughes,\n1987).\nNUMERICAL MODELING\nExperimental Design\nNumerical ice-sheet modeling is used to test\nthe role of topographic and mass-balance\nchanges on East Antarctic Ice Sheet configu-\nrations (Fig. 2). A horizontally averaged two-\ndimensional (2D) model is used to undertake\nreconnaissance studies, to examine changes in\n198 GEOLOGY, March 2004\nFigure 1.

This extent is then used to prescribe\nthe positional limits of the more sophisticated\nthree-dimensional (3D) model to examine the\nvariation in the velocity structure of the ice\nsheet (Fig. 2).\nBoundary conditions are provided by an al-\ntered (an erroneous ridge in Prydz Bay was\nremoved), isostatically unloaded BEDMAP\nsubglacial topography (Lythe et al., 2000). El-\nements of topography that may exert control\non East Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior were al-\ntered systematically in our experiments. To-\npographic changes made were as follows. First\nthe elevation of the Prince Charles Mountains\nand Princess Elizabeth Land\u2013Mawson escarp-\nment was lowered from maximum elevations\nof 2000 m to 500 m, the average values of the\nhinterlands. The maximum height of the Gam-\nburtsev Subglacial Mountains was also re-\nduced, from .2900 m to 1200 m, the approx-\nimate bed height at Dome Fuji, farther north.\nBathymetric changes to the Lambert graben\nand Prydz Bay involved raising the seafloor\nto a minimum elevation (maximum water\ndepth) of either 400 or 200 m below sea level\nfrom values typically .500 m.\nGEOLOGY, March 2004 199\nFigure 2. Flow diagram illustrating structure and function of numerical ice-sheet models\nused in this investigation. Two-dimensional (2D) model (Payne et al., 1989) calculates\nsteady-state ice sheet based on continuity equation for ice and routines for isostasy, and\nfloating and calving ice (depth function is used following Pelto and Warren, 1991). Model\nruns last 25,000 simulated years, approximately twice as long as required to achieve steady-\nstate solutions. Prescribed modern mass balance results in good match with present ice-\nsheet extent (see Fig. 1A). Ice-sheet velocity structure is assessed using steady-state, fully\nthree-dimensional (3D) thermo-mechanical model, which calculates ice temperatures and\nvelocity in coupled manner (Payne, 1999). Model includes isostasy and basal slip. Model\nruns last 100,000 yr and use prescribed ice margin position, derived from 2D model. In this\npaper, model is used to examine how bed changes affect ice flow and velocity. To this end,\ninterplay between topography and bathymetry, ice-sheet thickness and, where bed is below\nsea level, transition from grounded to floating ice is important. Grounding-line mechanics\nare not explicitly treated. Migration of grounding line is related to flux of ice, ice thickness,\nand depth of water in which floatation can occur.\nModel scenarios employ a combination of\nthese topographic changes using a modern\nmass balance and temperature regime, with\nfurther testing using an LGM mass balance\nand sea level to assess modern East Antarctic\nIce Sheet sensitivity (as in Huybrechts, 1990;\ni.e., a 10 8C reduction in air temperature, a\n50% reduction in accumulation, and a 120 m\nreduction in sea level). Note that the Miocene\nand Pliocene climates may have been warmer\nand wetter than today. Such a climate scenar-\nio, and its effect on ice flow and extent, is\ncertainly worth investigating, but we restrict\nourselves here to analyzing the ice-sheet re-\nsponse to bed morphology.\nModel Results\nThe modeled East Antarctic Ice Sheet is rel-\natively insensitive to alterations in the eleva-\ntions of mountains in the continental interior;\nsuch alterations do not result in significant ad-\nvances of the ice sheet onto the continental\nshelf (Figs. 1B, 1C). Lower mountain eleva-\ntions result in broader ice-transport pathways,\nbut the overall velocity structure of the ice\nsheet is unaffected (Fig. 1F).\nIce-sheet extent can be increased signifi-\ncantly only by altering the bathymetry of the\nLambert graben and Prydz Bay (Figs. 1B,\n1D). Raising the floor of the Lambert graben\nby only a small amount (to a maximum 400\nm water depth) results in ice-sheet expansion\nto the outer limits of the graben, i.e., to about\nthe present location of the current Amery Ice\nShelf edge. However, this change must be\ncoupled with raising the Prydz Bay floor to a\ndepth of 200 m, or to 400 m combined with\nan LGM climate and sea level, before shelf-\nedge glaciation is achieved (Figs. 1B, 1D).\nOnly model runs with changes to the bathym-\netry of the graben and continental shelf result\nin shelf-edge glaciation.\nDISCUSSION\nPrydz Bay Ice-Stream Development\nOne of the unanswered questions of Prydz\nBay glacial history is, how did ice dynamics\nchange during the late Miocene\u2013early Plio-\ncene interval? The late establishment of an ice\nstream and associated trough-mouth fan sedi-\nmentation in an environment dominated by a\nPaleozoic and younger topographic structure\nis surprising. What implications do these ice-\ndynamic changes have for arguments concern-\ning Pliocene East Antarctic Ice Sheet stabili-\nty? The 3D numerical modeling demonstrates\nthat the effect of raising the bounding moun-\ntains is to focus ice flow into the graben, in-\ncreasing both ice flux and velocity (cf. Figs.\n1F and 1E). Ice-sheet extent in terms of\ngrounded ice on the continental shelf is un-\naffected, however. Such topographic changes\nmay be due to structurally or erosionally driv-\nen uplift of the graben\u2019s flanks, which is likely\nto have been significant (.500 m) during the\nMiocene Epoch (cf. Hambrey and McKelvey,\n2000a).\nWe argue, therefore, that at least part of the\ntransition from fjordal ice-proximal sedimen-\ntation to focused, continental shelf-edge sedi-\nmentation seen at the Miocene-Pliocene tran-\nsition is probably related to the uplift history\nof the Lambert graben and coeval changes in\nice dynamics. Pliocene evidence at Prydz Bay\nfor a more dynamic ice setting (Hambrey and\nMcKelvey, 2000a) and large-scale ice reces-\nsion (Hambrey et al., 1991) has been inter-\npreted as consistent with a \u2018\u2018dynamist\u2019\u2019 whole-\nscale retreat of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nHowever, this interpretation may instead be a\nresult of the development of an ice stream\nwithin the Lambert graben. Rapid ice veloci-\nties and beds below sea level render ice\nstreams very sensitive to alteration in other\nboundary conditions, such as sea-level and\noceanographic change. These two conditions\nare both likely to have varied significantly in\nthe Prydz Bay region during the Pliocene Ep-\noch. We argue that glacial history within the\nLambert system during this epoch is in fact\npartway between the traditional \u2018\u2018dynamist\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018stabilist\u2019\u2019 contentions.\nSome constraint may also be placed on the\nprobable age of Prydz Channel. Although it is\na relatively shallow feature in the shelf (;200\nm relief), the channel focuses ice flux at the\nshelf edge (Fig. 1G). Assuming that the mas-\nsive volume of sediment deposited in the\nPrydz Channel fan since late Miocene time\n(Figs. 1A, 1B) is a result of glacial processes\nalone, then the channel, however small, must\nhave existed at the same time in order to focus\nflow from the Lambert graben to this one\npoint. Because shelf progradation was approx-\nimately equal everywhere along the shelf edge\n200 GEOLOGY, March 2004\nuntil late Miocene time (Cooper et al., 1991),\nwe believe the Prydz Channel is unlikely to\nsignificantly predate late Miocene time.\nErosional Controls on Ice-Sheet Extent?\nThe failure of the Lambert-Amery system\nto reach the outer shelf during the LGM (Do-\nmack et al., 1998) is replicated in our mod-\neling experiments. The minimum requirement\nto induce shelf-edge glaciation with an LGM\nclimate and sea level is the raising of the floor\nof the Lambert graben to a maximum water\ndepth of 400 m. In the model domain, this\nequates to the reemplacement of a minimum\nof 1.39 3 106 km3 of sediment in the graben\n(unadjusted for compaction or isostasy). The\nvolume of late Miocene sediment required to\nraise the graben floor for shelf-edge glaciation\nrequires a time span of ;1 m.y. on the basis\nof the long-term post\u2013late Miocene deposi-\ntional rate of the Prydz Channel fan, as cal-\nculated from seismic mapping in O\u2019Brien et\nal. (2001) (Fig. 1A). The suggestion that the\nice sheet has not advanced to the shelf edge\nsince at least the Bruhnes-Matuyama bound-\nary (0.73 Ma), first interpreted on the basis of\nthe geology of the fan (O\u2019Brien et al., 2001),\nhas strong support in the modeling results.\nThe extent of this sector of the East Ant-\narctic Ice Sheet is currently limited strongly\nby the erosionally determined depth of the\nLambert graben. Prydz Bay was probably a\nsite of sediment transfer in the Quaternary Pe-\nriod. The reported seismic character and sed-\niment distribution in Prydz Bay (O\u2019Brien et\nal., 2001) replicate the appearance of other\nice-streaming areas, such as the North Sea off\nScandinavia, where sediment transport has\nbeen inferred (Sejrup et al., 1996). The re-\nmoval of sediment from the relatively soft\nfloor of the Lambert graben has overdeepened\nthe fjord to such a degree that it is almost\nimpossible to ground ice through it at a flux\nsufficient to drive the ice sheet fully across the\nshelf.\nAdditional Controls on Ice-Sheet Extent\nWhile this paper is not concerned directly\nwith testing the hypothesis that increased ac-\ncumulation rates affect the glaciation of Prydz\nBay, it is appropriate to mention it. This hy-\npothesis can certainly be tested in future mod-\neling experiments, where an ice-sheet model\nis linked to a climate model, in a manner sim-\nilar to that of DeConto and Pollard (2003).\nThe results presented here depend greatly on\nthe depth-related iceberg-calving model.\nWhile changing the model alters the position\nof the ice margin, it does not affect adversely\nthe main conclusions of the paper.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe value of predictive, geologically con-\ntrolled, regional studies is in the ability to\ntease out individual factors that may be im-\nportant in inducing large-scale and significant\nice-sheet change. The results presented here\nindicate that understanding the structural and\nerosional history of the Lambert graben and\nPrydz Bay are probably the most critical ele-\nments in understanding more fully the glacial\nhistory of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and, in\nparticular, changes in its behavior during the\nMiocene-Pliocene transition.\nUplift of the bounding Prince Charles\nMountains and Mawson escarpment focused\nice flow into the Lambert graben, thickened\nthe ice sheet, and increased ice flux. These\nchanges led to a reorganization of ice flow and\nthe establishment of fast-flowing ice in the\ngraben and on the continental shelf, as reflect-\ned in the sedimentary record. During the\nPleistocene Epoch, erosion of the graben floor\nlimited ice flux and extent of the ice sheet on\nthe continental shelf, resulting in the current\nEast Antarctic Ice Sheet climatic insensitivity\nand configuration. While climatic changes\nform the overall framework for Antarctic his-\ntory, we suggest that this sector of the East\nAntarctic Ice Sheet is at least equally strongly\ncontrolled by topographic forcing.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was funded as part of UK Natural En-\nvironment Research Council (NERC) grant NER\/A\/\nS\/2000\/01256 to Hambrey, Siegert, David Sugden,\nand Payne, using a model developed with NERC\ngrant NER\/A\/S\/1999\/00178.
