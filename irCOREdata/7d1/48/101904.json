Morphological rules are a way \nof translating those values into forms. This is not always straightforward, \nand any model of morphology must make provisions for deviations from \nthis simple principle, such as allomorphy, syncretism (homophony between \ninflected forms that should be distinct), defectiveness (absence of an \nexpected form) or deponency (mismatch between form and value). This \npaper looks at one such phenomenon, that of morphological reversal, where \na morphological opposition seems to reverse its function across \nenvironments. A classic example comes from the Semitic languages, such as \n                                                \n1\n For discussion of the issues here, I thank Greville Corbett, Bill Palmer and Nigel Vincent, \nas well as audiences at Cambridge (Linguistics Association of Great Britain annual \nmeeting, 2005), Albuquerque (Linguistic Society of America annual meeting, 2006) and \nLeipzig (Rara and Rarissima conference, 2006).

The notion was made explicit as far \nback as 1912 by Carl Meinhof, who gave it the name \u2018polarity\u2019, defined as \n\u2018if A becomes B under certain  conditions, B becomes A under the same \nconditions.\u2019 (1912: 19; translation MB).2 Hetzron (1967: 184) gives a more \nformalized definition: \n \n(3)  [\u2026] when there exist two grammatical categories (signifi\u00e9s) X and Y, \nand two corresponding exponents (signifiants) A and B, then value X \ncan sometimes be assumed by A, while B denotes Y; and sometimes \nX is expressed by B, and then it is necessarily A that represents Y. \n \nGraphically, this can be represented as in (4).  \n \n                                                \n2\n \u2018Wenn also aus A unter gewissen Bedingungen B wird, so wird aus B unter denselben \nBedingungen A.\u2019 \n  4\n(4) Polarity per Hetzron (1967) \n context 1 context 2 \ncategory X exponent A exponent B \ncategory Y exponent B exponent A \n \n Since its introduction, polarity has existed in a twilight zone, with \nuncertain status in grammatical theory. On the one hand, some researchers \nreject the notion that there is a type of rule which effects a morphological \nreversal, viewing this as an implausible and unnecessary concept. On the \nother hand, variant formulations under various names continue to be \nadvanced (and in turn rejected by others). Overall, a review of the literature \nleaves one with an impression of vague unease with reversals, coupled with \na persistent desire to accommodate a certain fairly limited set of facts. The \naim of the present paper is to show that morphological reversals do occur, \nand to argue that of the various analyses, the sort of proportional analogy \ninherent in Hetzron\u2019s definition in (3) best accounts for the facts. \n \n2 Exchange rules \nThere is another, alternative way of characterizing morphological reversals \nthat is widely known, namely as an exchange rule. Exchange rules have the \nformat [\u03b1F] \u0001 [\u2013\u03b1F], where F represents some feature, and the variable \u03b1 \nstands in for its \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 value. This has the effect of reversing the value of \nF, whatever that might be. Probably the most celebrated example of an \n  5\nexchange rule comes from the Nilotic language Luo, first discussed in these \nterms by Gregersen (1972), and subsequently treated by (among others) \nAnderson and Browne (1973), Anderson (1992), Stonham (1994), Spencer \n(1998), Alderete (2001), de Lacy (2002), Mortensen (2002), Moreton \n(2003), Fitzpatrick, Nevins and Vaux (2004) and Wolf (2005). Luo has \nthree different plural endings (in addition to plurals formed by various stem \nalternations): (i) the ending -ni, e.g. rabo\u014bgi ~ rabo\u014bg-ni \u2018salt strainer \n(Tucker 1994: 142), (ii) the ending -e, e.g. rabo\u014bgi ~ rabo\u014bg-e (same as \nprevious), and (iii) the non-productive ending -i, e.g. juok ~ juog-i \u2018spirit\u2019 \n(Tucker 1994: 131); all these endings are accompanied by deletion of any \nfinal vowel. When -e or -i is used, some stem-final consonants undergo an \nalternation. The alternations are phonologically diverse; what concerns us \nare stems ending in consonants where a phonemic voice distinction is found. \nThese display a reversal. Where the singular stem ends in a voiceless \nconsonant, the plural stem ends in the voiced equivalent. Where the singular \nstem ends in a voiceless consonant, the plural stem ends in the voiced \nequivalent. \n \n  6\n(5) Voicing reversal in Luo (Okoth-Okombo 1982: 57-63)  \n singular plural   \na. kidi kite \u2018stone\u2019  \n cogo coke \u2018bone\u2019  \n puo\u00f0o puo\u03b8e \u2018garden\u2019  \n raba r\u03b5p\u03b5 \u2018rubber\u2019  \n     \nb. koti kode \u2018coat\u2019  \n agoko  agoge \u2018chest\u2019 (Tucker 1994: 491) \n ruo\u03b8 ruo\u00f0i \u2018chief\u2019  \n arip aribe \u2018milky way\u2019 (Tucker 1994: 128) \n \nThis can be expressed as an exchange rule where the variable is voice \n(adapting Gregersen 1972: 106): \n \n(6) \u03b1Voice \u0001 -\u03b1Voice\/plural in -e or -i          \n \n In Optimality Theory, a variant of exchange rules has been invoked \nin the guise of anti-faithfulness constraints. Normal faithfulness constraints, \nwhich are a cornerstone of Optimality Theory, require that two elements \nmatch. Anti-faithfulness constraints require the opposite, namely that two \nelements not match. Alderete (2001) provides such an analysis of consonant \npolarity in Luo, which can be paraphrased as \u2018a plural form with the endings \n  7\n-e or -i does not have the same specification for the feature Voice as the \nbase form (singular) it is derived from\u2019. \n It has long been assumed that polarity and exchange rules are \nfundamentally equivalent (Chomsky and Halle 1968: 355-56, who attribute \nthis observation to Bever 1963). In fact, there are important differences \nbetween the two, and these will be important in the analysis offered in \u00a75 \nbelow. In the interim, it will be useful to have a cover term that will \nsubsume both notions, for which I retain the neutral term \u2018morphological \nreversal\u2019. \n \n3 Arguments against morphological reversals \nTheoretical objections to the notion of morphological reversal are based on \nthe postulate that rules should not be able to arbitrarily switch feature \nvalues. In practice there seem to be two lines of argument, depending on \nwhether the example under discussion has been described as representing \npolarity or exchange rules. A recent attempt to refute polarity comes from \nLecarme (2002: 113), who writes: \n \nIrrespective of the empirical question of whether polarity systems \nare found in natural language, a polarity principle should also be \nrejected on conceptual grounds. It is hard to see how it could meet \n  8\nthe design conditions on human language, or plausible assumptions \nabout learnability.3 \n \nLecarme discusses gender marking in Classical Arabic, which is, mutatis \nmutandis, identical to that of Hebrew as discussed above in (1), with Arabic \n-at  corresponding to Hebrew -a. She writes: \n \n[...] I will suggest that there is no \u2018agreement\u2019 in [the numeral \nphrase] in that the \/-at\/ ending of the numeral does not reflect the \ngender of the (either singular or plural) head noun. Rather, the \/-at\/ \nsuffix is better understood as representing a particular form class, \nwhich in the default instance is associated with feminine gender \n(Rolf Noyer p.c.). Assuming this, the concord rule states that \nnumerals of masculine nouns are assigned to the \/-at\/ form class, \ntherefore it is part of the morphology rather than the syntax. (p. 111, \nfn. 3) \n \nIn other words, Lecarme argues that we do not find a switch of syntactic \ngender in numeral phrases, but rather a switch of the morphological \nexponence of gender: -at normally realizes feminine gender, but \nexceptionally realizes masculine gender with numerals (and, by implication, \n\u00d8 displays the reverse behaviour). However, this is fully in accord with the \n                                                \n3\n Lecarme offers no evidence to back up these assertions. \n  9\nnotion of polarity as normally defined. Indeed, Hetzron explicitly defines \npolarity as a switch in the formal exponence of otherwise fixed syntactic \ngender (and Meinhof does so implicitly, in the context of the discussion it is \nembedded in).4 Thus, all Lecarme argues against is a particular construal (or \nmisconstrual) of the notion of polarity, but still accepts it in its classic \nformulation. Note that these ideas are not original: my observations \ncorrespond to those of Hetzron (1967: 188), commenting on Speiser (1938), \nwho had made same arguments later made by Lecarme. \n Where it is exchange rules that are being argued against, the claim is \nthat they are simply an analytical artefact that results from misidentifying \nthe features involved. As an example of this line of reasoning we can take \nStonham\u2019s Combinatorial morphology (1994), which devotes a whole \nchapter to it. The basis for his rejection of exchange rules is the assumption \nthat morphological processes necessarily involve the addition of \ninformation. Exchange rules, by contrast, merely rearrange information. \nAmong other examples, he discusses consonant polarity in Luo. He \nattributes the appearance of a reversal to the existence of two classes of \nnouns, one which is underlyingly singular (Basic Singulars) and one which \n                                                \n4\n Thus Meinhof gives the analogy of the Nandi (speakers of a Nilo-Saharan language), who \nhave a custom where boys dress like girls before their puberty rites, and girls like boys. \nThere is no suggestion that their biological gender switches with the onset of puberty, only \nthe formal trappings thereof. \n  10\nis underlyingly plural (Basic Plurals). For both classes, the basic form ends \nin a voiceless consonant. Voicing signals \u2018marked\u2019 number, which is plural \nin the case of basic singulars and singular in the case of basic plurals. His \nproposed rule is given in (7), and is illustrated in (8). \n \n(7) Stonham\u2019s (1994: 102) analysis of consonant polarity in Luo  \n C \u0001 [+voiced] \/ __(V)# \n     [+marked number] \n \n(8) Illustration of Stonham\u2019s (1994) analysis  \nbasic number \n(voiceless) \n\u2018marked\u2019 number \n(voiced) \n  \nkoti (SG) kode (PL) \u2018coat\u2019 Basic Singular noun \nkite (PL) kidi (SG) \u2018stone\u2019 Basic Plural noun \n \nOn this analysis, the voicing alternation is construed as having a consistent \nfunction, marking \u2018marked\u2019 number.  (Similar arguments, though for \ndifferent data, were made by Smith 1979 and Serzisko 1982.)  \n  11\n This analysis has some purely empirical problems, which need not \nconcern us here.5 More important is the fact that this analysis continues to \nrely on the notion of a variable, which is the salient feature of an exchange \nrule. Stonham\u2019s rule in (7) produces a \u2018marked\u2019 number stem, but fails to \naddress the relationship between \u2018marked\u2019 number and the value plural, \nwhich is still needed in order to account for the plural suffixes. This \nrelationship must be expressed as a variable (or equivalent): marked number \nhas the value plural for basic singulars and singular for basic plurals. One \noption would be to supplement (7) with a second rule in which the value of \n\u2018marked\u2019 was variable, as in (9), which states that the markedness value of a \ngiven noun switches from singular to plural.  \n \n(9) \u03b1Marked \u0001 -\u03b1Marked \/plural in -e or -i \n \n                                                \n5\n In addition to -e and -i, Luo has a third plural ending, -ni, which precludes consonant \nalternation, e.g. singular higa \u2018year, season\u2019 ~ plural hik-e or hig-ni, singular agoko \u2018chest\u2019 \n~ plural agog-e or agok-ni (Tucker 1994: 141, 143). In terms of Stonham\u2019s analysis, the \nhiga ~ hik-e type should be a Basic Plural, in which case there is no explanation for why the \n\u2018marked\u2019 number form appears with the plural ending -ni. More seriously, Stonham offers \nno evidence for the semantic distinction implied by the notions \u2018Basic Singular\u2019 and \u2018Basic \nPlural\u2019 (nor is there any in the original sources; note that the same observation applies to his \nanalysis of vowel ablaut in Diegue\u00f1o). In any event, the same alternations characterize \npossessed nouns (e.g. kitabu \u2018book\u2019 ~ kitapa \u2018my book, agoko \u2018chest\u2019 ~ agoga \u2018my chest\u2019 \n(Tucker 1994: 166), so it is fairly clear that number is not the deciding factor. \n  12\nBetter still, we can dispense with the notion of \u2018marked\u2019 entirely, and have a \nsingle rule which simply say that that voicing causes the basic number value \nof a noun (\u00b1pl) to switch: \n \n(10) \u03b1pl \u0001 -\u03b1pl \/ [+voiced C](V)# \n \nEither way, a full formalization of Stonham\u2019s proposal requires the use of a \nvariable, or equivalent.  \n When we consider Stonham\u2019s line of argumentation alongside \nLecarme\u2019s, we see that they are the inverse of each other. Lecarme argues \nthat there is no reversal of morphosyntactic features (she rejects the notion \nthat gender values can be switched), but allows for a reversal of \nmorphological form (she allows gender exponents to be switched). Stonham \nargues the reverse, rejecting the notion that the formal exponents of number \ncan be switched, and arguing instead that it is the morphosyntactic (or \nmorphosemantic) value of number that can be switched. Weigel (1993) \nmakes explicit the complementarity between the two notions, reserving the \nterm \u2018exchange rule\u2019 for a reversal rule which has a phonological feature as \na variable, and coining the term \u2018morphosyntactic toggle\u2019 for a reversal rule \nwhich has a morphosyntactic value as its variable. It is hard to see how a \nformal model which could admit one could exclude the other in any \nprincipled fashion. Thus, Lecarme\u2019s and Stonham\u2019s counterproposals, when \n  13\nviewed alongside each other, constitute a tacit argument in favour of the \ntheoretical necessity to represent morphological reversals. \n \n4 More evidence for morphological reversals \nEven if the idea of morphological reversals is theoretically unimpeachable, \nthere remains the question of how much empirical evidence there really is \nfor postulating the phenomenon. If we take the Semitic example as \ncanonical, there are two criteria that should be met: (i) there is an alternation \nbetween exponents A and B whose associated values are switched between \ncontext 1 and context 2, and (ii) each context implies the other, i.e. the \nparadigm found in context 2 constitutes the mirror image of the paradigm in \ncontext 1, and vice versa. While criterion i is clearly definitional, criterion ii \nis less obviously so, and indeed, most instances of morphological reversals \nthat have been cited in the literature do not conform to it. Take for example \nthe alternation between partitive singular and partitive plural endings in \nEstonian, described by Blevins (2005: 12). If the partitive singular ends in -\ni, the partitive plural ends in -e, and vice versa (11a, b). For such nouns the \nprinciple of reversal holds. But there are also other partitive singular \nendings which alternate with -i and -e in the plural (11c, d). Consequently, \nthe set of singular noun forms ending in -i and -e and the set of plural noun \nforms ending in -i and -e are not mirror images of each other..  \n \n  14\n(11) Partitive endings in Estonian \n PART SG  PART PL  \na. `kool-i `kool-e \u2018school\u2019 \nb. `kukk-e `kukk-i \u2018rooster\u2019 \nc. lukk-u lukk-e \u2018lock\u2019 \nd. mokk-a mokk-i \u2018lip\u2019 \n \nSimilar phenomena that have been described as reversals include vowel \nalternations in Semitic verbs (Chomsky and Halle 1968: 356-57) and in \nSpanish (Matthews 1974: 140). \n However, for heuristic purposes it will be useful to retain criterion ii, \nin as much as it makes it all the more apparent that the reversal is systematic \nand not accidental. If we can thus demonstrate the validity of this more \nstringent notion of morphological reversal, the same interpretation may also \nbe given to examples which fail to adhere to criterion ii. The examples in \nthe following subsections represent particularly clear examples of \nmorphological reversals that conform to both criteria. All of them have \npreviously been described as reversals, but have not yet received the \nattention they warrant from the side of morphological theory. They involve \nthree different morphosyntactic features: number, aspect and grammatical \nrole.  \n \n  15\n4.1 Number in Nehan \nThe Oceanic language Nehan marks number on definite and indefinite \narticles, nouns themselves being uninflected (see discussion in Corbett \n2000: 163-64). The indefinite article and the topic\/subject definite article \neach have two number forms, but which number they mark depends on noun \nclass, which Ross (1988) distinguishes as class O versus class A, \ncorresponding roughly to count and non-count. The singular for class A is \nthe plural for class B, and vice versa: \n \n(12) Nehan indefinite articles (Glennon and Glennon 1994: 4) \n count nouns (class A)  non-count nouns (class O) \nsingular me lo \u2018a dog\u2019  mo iob  \u2018a knife\u2019 \nplural mo lo \u2018some dogs\u2019  me iob  \u2018some knives\u2019 \n \n(13) Nehan topic\/subject definite articles (Ross 1988: 299)  \n count nouns (class A)  non-count nouns (class O) \nsingular a uma \u2018a\/the house\u2019  o doki  \u2018a tree, stick\u2019 \nplural o uma \u2018some\/the houses\u2019  a doki  \u2018a collection of trees\u2019 \n \nOf course, in order to justify identifying these as examples of morphological \nreversal, some evidence must be given that there is a distinction of singular \nand plural that is independent of noun class, that is, a demonstration that \nmo\/o of class A is morphosyntactically equivalent to the me\/a of class O, \nand so on. Otherwise, we might dispense with the notion of singular ~ plural \n  16\naltogether, and say that Nehan simply distinguishes basic versus derived \nnumber, whose particular interpretation in terms of referential number is a \nmatter of lexical semantics, but not of morphosyntax. Evidence for singular \n~ plural can indeed be found, namely in the non-topic\/subject definite \narticle, illustrated in (14).  \n \n (14) Nehan definite articles (Glennon and Glennon 1994: 22) \n   non-topic\/subject topic\/subject article \n   singular plural singular plural \nclass A human  tar toso a o \n animate   tar tasir a o \n body \nparts \n tar tar a o \n default  tar toro a o \n       \nclass O animate   toro\/tang tasir o a \n default  toro tar o a \n \nWhat needs to be noted here is the behaviour of the articles used with \nanimate nouns. Some animate  nouns belong to class A and some to class O, \nand the form of the topic\/subject article used with them is the same as for \nother semantic types. However, the non-topic\/subject article has the plural \nform tasir for both classes. That is, there is a singular ~ plural opposition \n  17\nwhich cross-cuts noun class. Thus the unambiguously plural form tasir \ncorresponds to the topic\/subject article o for class A animates and to a for \nclass O animates. This indicates that the forms of the topic\/subject article \ncannot be ascribed entirely to lexical semantics; for animates, at least, there \nis a genuine singular ~ plural opposition whose morphological expression is \nreversed across the two noun classes. \n \n4.2 Aspect in T\u00fcbatulabal \nThe Uto-Aztecan language T\u00fcbatulabal, described by Voegelin (1935), \nshows a reversal in its aspect marking morphology for one set of verbs. \nEvery verb displays two distinct aspectual stems, telic and atelic. The telic \nstem is  \n \n \u2018[...] used for an action (e.g., \u2018to take a bite\u2019) or condition (e.g. \u2018it \ngot green\u2019) performed or arrived at in an instant (perfective without \ntense commitment), and for this reason the action or condition is \ngenerally, though not necessarily, felt to be completed at the time of \ntalking.\u2019  \n \nwhile the atelic stem is  \n \n\u2018[...]sometimes used when an action requires some duration for its \nperformance (\u2018to eat\u2019), but frequently the atelic is quite vague in \nrespect to aspectual meaning.\u2019 (Voegelin 1935: 94) \n  18\n \nThe stems differ in the repertoire of verbal affixes they can take (Voegelin \n1935: 95-96). Atelic stems alone take the following suffixes: subordinating, \nimperative, present tense, exhortative, permissive, past habituative, irrealis \nand adversative. Only telic stems take the future suffix. Further, atelic stems \nalways occur with a suffix, while telic stems may be unsuffixed. The \nalternation between the two stems is realized by reduplication: the atelic \nstem is basic, and the telic stem is formed from the underlying base by \npreposing a copy of the vowel of the first syllable: \n \n (15) Typical verb stem alternations  (Voegelin 1935: 95, 102) \natelic          telic \nela- e-\u0294ela \u2018jump\u2019  \nt\u0268k- \u0268-t\u0268k \u2018eat\u2019  \ntana-  a-ndana          \u2018get down\u2019 \npa:ab\u0268-    a:-ba:ab\u0268      \u2018be tired\u2019  \nyu\u0294udz- u-yu\u0294uts \u2018throw\u2019 \n \nOther differences between the two stems are the predictable result of regular \nphonological rules (e.g. the stem-initial obstruents undergo changes when \npost-vocalic, showing regressive nasal harmony, and voicing when the \npreceding vowel is bimoraic; Voegelin 1935: 80-82). This opposition quite \nregular for all verbs, except for a group of around thirty verbs which \n  19\nVoegelin calls \u2018reverse formations\u2019. With these, the telic stem is \nmorphologically basic and the atelic stem is formed by reduplication. The \nlist in (16) gives, according to Voegelin (1935), essentially all the verbs of \nthis type. \n \n(16) Reversed aspectual stems (Voegelin 1935:  95-96)  \ntelic atelic   telic atelic  \nai a-\u0294ay- \u2018pick up\u2019   n\u028a\u014b \u028a-n\u028a\u014b- \u2018pound\u2019 \nca:k a-cag- \u2018roast\u2019  patsa:h  a-patsa:h- \u2018shell nuts\u2019  \nc\u0268:i \u0268:-c\u0268y- \u2018rock a cradle\u2019  p\u0268\u014bw\n\u0298\n \u0268-mb\u0268\u014bw- \u2018roll string \non thigh\u2019  \nci:p \u026a-cib- \u2018whittle\u2019  ta\u014b a-nda\u014b-  \u2018kick\u2019 \ncilu:p i:-cilu:b- \u2018split wood\u2019   t\u026a\u014bwa \u026a-nd\u026a\u014bwa- \u2018summon\u2019 \nciuk i:-ciug- \u2018comb\u2019  t\u00f4lo:h \u00f4-t\u00f4lo:h- \u2018groan\u2019 \nc\u00f4lo:\u014b \u00f4-c\u00f4lo:\u014b- \u2018snore\u2019  tsa:ya:u   a:-dza:ya:w- \u2018yell\u2019  \nha:itc a-ha:id\u017e- \u2018chew\u2019  ts\u0268xk \u0268t-s\u0268xk- \u2018prick\u2019 \nh\u0268:p \u0268-h\u0268:b- \u2018massage\u2019  tu:c \u028a-t\u028ac- \u2018grind\u2019 \nh\u0268:t \u0268-h\u0268:d- \u2018pluck feathers\u2019  t\u028ama:u \u028a-nd\u028ama:w- \u2018fail\u2019 \n  20\nku:c \u028a-k\u028ac- \u2018grow\u2019  t\u028amu:ga \u028a-nd\u028amu:ga- \u2018dream\u2019 \nm\u0268l:t- \u0268-m\u0268l:d- \u2018scold\u2019  wuba \u028a-wuba- \u2018whip\u2019 \nna:yuw\u0298   a:-na:yuw- \u2018be tired\u2019   ya:n a:-ya:n- \u2018sing\u2019 \nna\u014b a-na\u014b- \u2018cry\u2019  y\u00f4:m \u00f4:-y\u00f4m- \u2018copulate\u2019 \nnap     a-nab-  \u2018throw\u2019   yug\u028a\u0294 \u028a-yug\u028a\u0294- \u2018cut\u2019 \n \nVoegelin stresses that they have no obvious shared semantic features that \nshould affect their relationship to aspect. That is, it is simply a stipulated set \nof verbs which employ the usual morphological operation for aspect \nmarking, but with the reversed value. In addition, there is a smaller group of \nverbs (Voegelin lists eleven) which maintain one stem for both aspects. \nSome of these appear to have originally been reduplicated stems, e.g. \u00f4:y\u00f4:g \n\u2018move\u2019,  \u028a yu:g \u2018fall\u2019, some not, e.g. \u00f4:l \u2018get up\u2019 (Voegelin 1935: 96). \n There is some evidence that this morphological reversal is noticed \nby speakers, with morphological ramifications. This occurs with \nnominalizations, which are regularly formed from the atelic stem through \nsuffixation of -i, as shown in (17). Of course, for most verbs, the atelic stem \nwill be the unreduplicated stem. \n \n  21\n (17) Nominalization (Voegelin 1935: 166) \natelic verb stem  noun   \nwac- \n\u2018dig\u2019 \n wac-\u026a-l \ndig-NMLZR-ABSL6 \n\u2018hole\u2019 \n normal verb \nanda\u014b- \n\u2018kick\u2019 \n anda\u014b-i:-l \nkick- NMLZR-ABSL \n\u2018person or thing kicked\u2019 \n reversed formation verb \n \nHowever, for the reversed formation verbs, this generalization runs into \nproblems. According to Voegelin (1935: 167), informants will sometimes \nproduce nominalizations of reversed formation verbs from the \nunreduplicated telic stem (thus na\u014bi:l in place of ana\u014bi:l \u2018the crying\u2019), \nthough when this is pointed out to them, they declare it to be incorrect, \nobserving that some people use such forms anyway. This may be the result \nof a conflict between verbal and nominal patterns of derivation\/inflection. \nVerbal patterns are based solely on aspect: in his description of the various \nverbal categories that are restricted to the atelic stem (see above), Voegelin \nmakes no mention of any vacillation in stem choice. Nominal patterns, for \ntheir part, are based solely on form. For example, consider the \naugmentative -bicwi-, which is a nominal suffix attached to nouns, including \n                                                \n6\n The absolute suffix is found with noun forms that do not have a pronominal suffix. \n  22\nnominalized verbs. With nominalized verbs the base for suffixation is \nalways the basic, unreduplicated stem, regardless of aspect. \n \n(18) Augmentative (Voegelin 1935: 163, 169) \natelic verb stem  noun   \ntsulu:m- \n\u2018sleep\u2019 \n tsulu:m-i-b\u026acw\u026a-t \nsleep-NMLZR-AUG-ABSL \n\u2018one who sleeps too much\u2019 \n normal verb \n\u00f4:y\u00f4m-  \n\u2018copulate\u2019 \n y\u00f4:mi-i-b\u026acw\u026a-t \ncopulate-NMLZR-AUG-ABSL \n\u2018one who copulates too much\u2019 \n reversed formation verb \n \nIt may be that for the nominalizations described above in (17), speakers \nwere unsure which pattern to follow, the aspect-based verbal pattern or the \nform-based nominal pattern.  \n \n4.3 Tense-aspect-mood in Copala Trique \nCopala Trique, a Mixtecan language described in various works by \nHollenbach (in particular Hollenbach 1976, 1992, 2005), shows a reversal in \nits tense-aspect-mood (TAM) morphology. Trique has three TAM forms, \ncontinuative, completive and potential (termed \u2018present\u2019, \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 \nin Hollenbach 2005). The continuative is the basic form, and the completive \nis formed from it by prefixation: \/g-\/ before a vowel, \/gV-\/ before a \n  23\nconsonant (note that lenis \/g\/ and fortis \/k\/ are not distinguished in non-final \nsyllables, and by convention only \/k\/ is written in this position); in the case \nof some consonant-initial stems, no prefix is found, and the continuative and \ncompletive are identical. The potential is formed from the completive by a \ntonal alternation. The basic system is outlined in (19). \n \n(19) Trique tense-aspect-mood forms (Hollenbach 1976: 126) \n continuative: basic stem   (uchruj32 \u2018lay down\u2019) \n completive: prefix + continuative  (c-uchruj32 \u2018laid down\u2019) \n potential: completive with alternation (c-uchruj2 \u2018will lay down\u2019) \n \nA brief note on the orthographic conventions is in order. The system of \nHollenbach (2005) is employed here. The features relevant for the present \ndiscussion are: (i) \/k\/ is written c, but qu before front vowels, (ii) ) j \nrepresents \/h\/, (iii) VV represents a long vowel, V a short vowel, (iv) (V)Vn \nrepresents a nasalized vowel, and (v) superscript numerals represent the \neight tones: 1-5, 13, 31, 32 (the higher the numeral, the higher the tone).  \n The morphological reversal occurs under negation. Two negation \nmarkers are used: ne3 with the continuative and completive, and se2 with the \npotential. While the continuative remains unaffected by negation (20), the \ncompletive assumes the form of the potential (21), and the potential assumes \nthe form of the completive (22). \n \n  24\n(20) Continuative (Hollenbach 1976: 126) \n a. uchruj32 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  lay.down.CNT boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy is laying the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \n b. ne3 uchruj32 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  not lay.down.CNT boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy isn\u2019t laying the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \n(21) Completive (Hollenbach 1976: 126) \n a. cuchruj32 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  lay.down.CPL boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy laid the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \n b. ne3 cuchruj2 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  not lay.down.CPL boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy didn\u2019t lay the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \n(22) Potential  (Hollenbach 1976: 127) \n a. cuchruj2 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  lay.down.POT boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy will lay the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \n  25\n b. se2 cuchruj32 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  not lay.down.POT boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy won\u2019t lay the palm mat down.\u2019 \n \nLest one think that an actual TAM reversal occurs under negation (rather \nthan simply a reversal of forms), observe that this effect only obtains when \nthe negative marker is immediately preverbal. If an adverb intervenes, then \nthe normal form is found (23); note that se2 does not permit an intervening \nadverb, so this only occurs for the completive with ne3. \n \n(23) Variation due to word order (Hollenbach 1976: 128) \n a. ne3 cuchruj2 za'1 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  not lay.down.CPL well boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy didn\u2019t lay the palm mat down well.\u2019 \n \n b. ne3 za'1 cuchruj32 xnii3 yuvee5 a32 \n  not well lay.down.CPL boy palm.mat DECL \n \u2018The boy didn\u2019t lay the palm mat down well.\u2019 \n \n Nor can the reversal be attributed to any phonological effect. First, \nnote that the negative marker has no effect on the continuative. This is \nespecially striking when one looks at those verbs which take no prefix in the \ncompletive, and thus have identical continuative and completive forms: \n \n  26\n(24) Unprefixed verb (Hollenbach 1976: 127) \n\u2018mend\u2019 positive negative \ncontinuative nanuva4 ne3 nanuva4 \ncompletive nanuva4 ne3 nanuva1 \npotential nanuva1 se2 nanuva4 \n \nSecond, the contrast between completive and potential forms is \nmorphologically diverse, depending on the verb, and this reversal takes \nplace for all of them. If the completive is taken as the base form, the \npotential always involves a lowering of tone. However, exactly which tone \nit is lowered to must be lexically specified for some types (Hollenbach \n1992: 328). In addition, some verbs add a final -h, orthographically -j (recall \nthat Vn represents a nasalized vowel): \n \n(25) Aspiration  (Hollenbach 2005: 129-130) \n\u2018wash\u2019 positive negative \ncontinuative naan5 ne3 naan5 \ncompletive quinaan5 ne3 quinanj1 \npotential quinanj1 se2 quinaan5 \n \nGiven the element of lexical specification, as well as the role played by non-\ntonal alternation, the reversal cannot be attributed to the effects of tone \nsandhi.  \n  27\n Hollenbach (1976: 127) makes some speculation about the origin of \nthis pattern. If the value of the two forms had originally been \u2018realized\u2019 \nversus \u2018unrealized\u2019, then only a positive completive would have had the \nrealized form; everything is else is unrealized (either by virtue of being \nnegated, or by virtue of being potential\/future). This would have led to an \nasymmetrical paradigm: the verb forms contrast in the positive, or in the \ncompletive, but not in the negative or the potential. Symmetry was restored \nby replacing the odd man out, namely the negative potential.  \n \n(26) Hollenbach\u2019s (1976) reconstruction  \n positive negative \ncompletive REALIZED ne3  UNREALIZED \npotential UNREALIZED se2  UNREALIZED \u0001 \n REALIZED \n \n Curiously, this is not the only morphological reversal found in the \nTrique languages. In Itnunyoso Trique, described by DiCanio \n(forthcoming), words may end in long vowel, -\u0294 or -h. First person singular \n(possession on nouns or subject marking on verbs) is marked by -h on words \nwhose base form ends in a final vowel or -\u0294, e.g. swa4tu32 \u2018shoe\u2019 ~ si2 \nswa\n3tuh3 \u2018my shoe\u2019, but on words whose base form ends in -h, first person \nsingular is marked by the deletion of -h, e.g. kuh5 \u2018bone\u2019~ si3 ku32 \u2018my \nbone\u2019.  \n  28\n \n4.4 Grammatical role in Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Amadiya) \nThe Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialect of Amadiya (Iraqi Kurdistan), \ndescribed by Hoberman (1989), shows a reversal in the subject ~ object \nvalue of pronominal suffixes found on verbs. For example, the two forms in \n(27) have the same sequence of suffixes, -ax \u20181PL\u2019 and -lu \u20183PL\u2019, but in (27a) \nthe first suffix represents the subject and the second the object, while in \n(27b), it is the reverse. \n \n(27) a. qam-mpa\u1e37t\u0323-ax-lu   b. mp\u0289l\u0323t\u0323-ax-lu  \n  PRET-remove-1PL-3SG   removed-1PL-3SG \n  \u2018we removed them\u2019    \u2018they removed us\u2019 \n     (Hoberman 1989: 95-96) \n \nThis pattern of morphological reversal is particularly interesting, because its \nhistory can be reconstructed to a greater extent than for the other examples \ndiscussed above. Since it is also particularly complex, it is presented below \nin some detail. \n The suffixes involved come in two sets, which Hoberman labels \u2018A\u2019 \nand \u2018L\u2019: \n \n  29\n(28) Pronominal suffixes (Hoberman 1989: 28) \n   A-suffixes L-suffixes \n1SG M  -\u0268n  -li \n1SG F  -an -li \n2SG M  -\u0268t -l\u0289x \n2SG F  -at -lax \n3SG  M    \u00d8  -le \n3SG F  -a -la \n1PL  -ax -lan \n2PL  -etun, -\u0268tu-* -loxun  \n3PL  -i -lu \n \n* The variant -\u0268tu- occurs when followed by an L-suffix. \n \nThe distribution and function of the suffixes depends on which verb stem \nthey are used with. Verbs have five stems, designated J, P, O, P(t) and C \n(these terms are drawn from Hetzron 1969), which differ in their vowel \npatterns, and are used to form the various TAM paradigms:  \n \n  30\n(29) Verb stems in Neo-Aramaic of Amadiya (Hoberman 1989: 30) \nJ-stem: general present, future, qam-preterite and subjunctive \n(formally distinguished from each other by prefixes) \nP-stem:  preterite \n(All J- and P-stem forms may additionally take the \nanteriority suffix -wa, thus deriving a past habitual from \nthe general present, conditional from the future, and so \non.) \nO-stem: imperative \nP(t)-stem: stative \nC-stem: progressive (also used for the passive and infinitive, \nwhich do not take pronominal suffixes) \n \nThe J-stem and P-stem both take A- and L-suffixes, but with this difference: \nwith the J-stem, the A-suffixes mark subject and L-suffixes mark object, \nwhile with the P-stem it is the other way around. The O-, P(t)- and C- stems \ntake L-suffixes as object, but have only limited marking of subject features. \nO-stem forms mark number of the subject (\u00d8 SG, -u(n) PL). P(t)- and C-stem \nforms are used in periphrastic constructions, with subject features marked \non the accompanying auxiliary, though P(t)-stem forms also mark gender \nand number of the subject, following the inflectional pattern of adjectives \n(-a M SG, -\u03b8a or -ta F SG, -e PL). Examples are given in (30): \n \n  31\n(30)  Pronominal suffix patterns correlated with stem type  (Hoberman \n1989: 35-36) \n word structure example ptx \u2018open\u2019  \n     \nJ-stem +A-suffix +L-suffix patx-ax-lu    \n\u2018we should open them\u2019 \n(subjunctive) \nP-stem +A-suffix +L-suffix ptix-\u0268n-noxun    \n\u2018you opened me\u2019 \n(preterite) \nO-stem +number +L-suffix pt\u0289x-u-le    \n\u2018open it (plural subject)\u2019 \n(imperative) \nP(t) stem +gender-number +L-suffix ptix-a-llu   \n\u2018having opened them\u2019 \n(M SG subject) \n(stative) \n \nWhat interests us here is the contrast of J-stem and P-stem forms. As (30) \nshows, their structure is identical. They differ only in the reversal of \ngrammatical roles assigned to the A- and L-suffixes. Their paradigms are \ncontrasted in Table 1. Hoberman does not give all the forms, but does state \noutright that all the logically possible combinations of suffixes do exist \n(Hoberman 1989: 36); the forms in the table given are drawn from various \nparts of his description. Some observations on the morphological details are \ngiven in the Appendix. \n \n[**For table 1, see end of document**] \n  32\n \nOf course, one possible explanation would be that the P-stem is involved in \nan inversion construction, where the grammatical relations are actually \nreversed. Hoberman (1989) argues that this is not the case, and that subject \nand object roles remain constant across the stems in spite of the \nmorphological reversal. The evidence comes from reflexivization, case \nmarking and definite object agreement: \n Reflexivization: the reflexive pronoun is co-referenced by the A-\nsuffix in J-stem forms (31) and by the L-suffix in P-stem forms (32); note \nthat the reflexive pronoun triggers feminine singular agreement on the verb:  \n \n(31) Reflexivization with J-stem form  (Hoberman 1989: 99) \n mand-\u0268n-na  gyan-i k\u0268s-le \n throw-1SG.M-3SG.F   self-1SG   \u2018chez\u2019-3SG.M \n \u2018Should I throw myself on his mercy?\u2019 \n \n(32) Reflexivization with P-stem form  (Hoberman 1989: 100) \n [...] \u0294wid-a-li gyan-i \u0295ani \n made-3SG.F-1SG   self-1SG   poor \n \u2018[...] I made myself poor.'\u2019 \n \n  33\n Case marking: though there is not normally any case marking on \nindependent nominals, there is a set of object pronouns used in highly \nformal style, which replace the object suffix found on the verb. Typically, \nthis occurs only with P-stem forms, where it is the A-suffixes which are \nreplaced (33). Very rarely, though, it may also occur with J-stem forms, in \nwhich case it is the L-suffix which is replaced (34).  \n \n (33) P-stem forms (Hoberman 1989:101) \n \u0161qil-ax-lu \u0161q\u0268l-lu \u0294aleni \n  took-1PL-3PL  \n or   \ntook-3PL   us \n both glossed as \u2018They took us.\u2019 \n \n(34) J-stem forms (Hoberman 1989:102) \n p\u0161aql-i-lan p\u0161aql-i \u0294aleni \n  take-3PL-1PL   \n or   \ntake-3PL   us \n both glossed as \u2018They will take us.\u2019 \n \n Definite object agreement: in the presence of an overt nominal \nobject, object marking on the verb is correlated with definiteness; this is \nmanifested with L-suffixes on J-stem forms (35) and A-suffixes on P-stem \nforms (36).  \n \n  34\n(35) J-stem forms (Hoberman 1989: 102) \n k\u0161am\u0294-i   baxta k\u0161am\u0294-i-la baxta \n  hear-3PL   woman   \n versus   \nhear-3PL-3SG.F   woman   \n \u2018They hear a woman\u2019   \u2018They hear the woman.\u2019 \n \n(36) P-stem forms (Hoberman 1989: 103) \n \u0161me\u0294-lu   baxta \u0161me\u0294-a-lu   baxta \n  heard-3PL   woman   \n versus   \nheard-3SG.F-3PL   woman   \n \u2018They heard a woman.\u2019    \u2018They heard the woman.\u2019 \n \n Though there is no direct evidence for the development of this \nsystem of pronominal suffixes, the broad outlines of the history of the Neo-\nAramaic verb are known, and some speculation can be made on the basis of \nthis and of the behaviour of related dialects. Let us first consider the L-\nsuffixes. These descend from the preposition l- \u2018to\u2019, inflected for person, \nnumber and gender. One of its functions in earlier Aramaic was to mark \ndefinite direct objects:  \n \n(37)  ktb-h     l-ktb-\u2019 \n wrote.3SG.M.SBJ-3SG.M.OBJ to-book-the  \n \u2018he wrote the book\u2019    (Creason 2004: 421) \n \n  35\nThe L-suffixes used as object markers continue this function. Another \nfunction was to mark indirect objects, which is one means (found elsewhere \nin Semitic as well) of expressing possession: \n \n(38)  \u2019yt  l-\u2019n\u0161-\u2019   ksp \n COP to-man-the silver \n \u2018the man has silver\u2019     (Creason 2004: 423) \n \nThe L-suffixes as subject markers continue this latter construction, which \ncame about in the following way. The P-stem forms derive from a stative \n(originally passive) participle, in which an agent could be expressed as a \npossessor by means of l-, as in (38). Thus a form like pt\u0268x-li \u2018I opened him\u2019 \nwill originally have been construed as \u2018he is opened (pt\u0268x-) to me (l-i)\u2019, i.e. \n\u2018I have him opened\u2019. The subsequent development of this construction into \na perfect, and ultimately a simple past tense, parallels that found in \nRomance and Germanic (Hopkins 1989). This will originally have been \nlimited to transitive verbs, yielding an \u2018ergative\u2019 construction, as is still \nfound in some dialects, e.g. pli\u1e6d-li \u2018I took (something) out\u2019 versus pl\u012b\u1e6d-an \u2018I \n(feminine) went out\u2019 (Hopkins 1989: 428). It is commonly suggested that \nthis was due to the influence of Iranian languages, where this construction is \nwidespread (Kapeliuk 1996, Hoberman 1989: 119), in particular Kurdish: \nthe Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects where this construction is found \nhave been in contact with Kurdish. Dialects where this construction is \n  36\nlimited to transitive verbs are still found, e.g. that of Sulemaniyya\/Halabja \n(Khan 2004: 85-86).  \n On this account, the formal correspondence between object marking \nwith J-stems and subject marking with P-stems is coincidental, and hence \ndoes not constitute evidence for a systematic morphological reversal. This \nonly comes when we consider the corollary development, namely the rise of \nA-suffixation to mark objects with P-stems. The intitial stage was shared by \nboth J-stems and P-stems. Both stems were originally participles, the J-stem \nbeing active and the P-stem stative. These were inflected for gender and \nnumber only; thus the Amadiya J-stem forms kpat\u0268x (M.SG), kpatx-a (F.SG) \nand kpatx-i (PL) \u2018open (something)\u2019 represent something like the original \ninflectional paradigm. The dimension of person was added to the paradigm \nthrough the addition of truncated variants of the first and second person \npronouns (N\u00f6ldeke 1868: 220, Khan 1999a), the older forms now limited to \nthird person. However, this last development, namely the expansion of A-\nsuffixation to first and second person, was general only for the J-stem. With \nthe P-stem, most dialects retain a restricted range of a-suffixes, allowing \nonly third person suffixes. The historical composition of the J- and P-stem \nforms, and the resulting asymmetry, is represented schematically in (39): \n \n  37\n(39) Diachronic composition of J- and P-stem forms  \n   A-suffix    \n participle  + gender-number  + person  + L-suffix  \nJ-stem: qa\u1e6dl -a  -li  \n kill.PTCP.ACT F.SG  me  \n *\u2018F.SG kills me\u2019 \u0001\u2018she kills me\u2019 \n      \n qa\u1e6dl -a -t -li  \n kill.PTCP.ACT F.SG 2SG me  \n \u2018you (F.SG) kill me\u2019   \n      \nP-stem: q\u1e6dil -a ------ -li  \n kill.PTCP.PASS F.SG ------ me  \n *\u2018F.SG was killed by me\u2019 \u0001*\u2018she was killed by me\u2019 \u0001 \u2018I killed her\u2019 \n \n The dialect of Arbel, described by Khan (1999a, b), can serve as an \nillustration of this type of asymmetrical system, which I take as the original \npoint of departure for the further developments found in Amadiya. With the \nP-stem, only the original three gender-number forms can serve as a basis for \nL-suffixation. The originally masculine zero-suffixed form is interpreted as \nnot specifying an object, the originally feminine form marks a third person \nsingular feminine object, and the originally plural form marks a plural \nobject. This is illustrated in  Table 2. \n \n[** for table 2, see end of document **] \n  38\n In case no object suffix is available (namely with first and second \nperson, as well as third person singular masculine), the objectless form is \nused in conjunction with the object marking particle \u0294ill-, which is typically \nenclitic to the verb. Compare the treatment of a third person singular \nmasculine object with a J-stem (40a) and a P-stem verb (40b): \n \n(40) a. J-stem form  b. P-stem form  \n \u0161imm-ake l\u0101-xall-at-te  \u0294\u0101ti  yal-ake  mix\u0294e-lox=\u0294ill-eu  \n name-the  PROG-wash-2SG.F-3SG.M  you  boy-the  revive-2SG.M=OBJ-3SG.M \n \u2018You shall wash the name.\u2019 \u2018You have revived the boy.\u2019  \n    (Khan 1999b: 291) \n \n(This construction with \u0294ill- may optionally be used even when an object \nsuffix is available.) Other dialects may have alternative solutions. In some, \nthe qam-preterite is used in these contexts. As a J-stem form, the qam-\npreterite permits the full range of object marking \u2013 in fact, it requires it, and \nnever appears without an object-marking L-suffix. Thus e.g. in Qaraqosh we \nfind the P-stem form without an object (nq\u0002\u0161-l\u0002 \u2018he struck\u2019), but the qam-\npreterite with an object (kam-naq\u0002\u0161-l\u0002 \u2018he struck him\u2019) (Khan 2002: 140). \nStill other dialects have fleshed out the object marking paradigm of the P-\nstem. One option is to extend the object-marking pattern found with other \nverb stems, namely L-suffixation. Such a system is found in the dialect of \nHertevin, described by Jastrow (1988). As a result, transitive P-stem forms \n  39\nhave a sequence of two L-suffixes, with the second one marking the object \n(note that, in a sequence of two L-suffixes, the second one begins in nn \nrather than l): \n \n(41) wed-le-nno\u1e25    \n made-1SG-2SG.M \n\u2018I\u2019ve made you.\u2019    (Jastrow 1988: 61) \n \nWith third person objects, this system is in competition with the older \nsystem, in which the object is marked by an A-suffix, i.e. a gender-number \nmarker: \n \n(42) Two systems of object marking in Hertevin \n innovative (L-suffix) older (gender-number marker on verb) \n wed-le-nna  wid-a-li    \n made-1SG-3SG.F made-3SG.F-1SG \n \u2018I\u2019ve made her.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve made her\u2019 (Jastrow 1988: 62) \n \nObject marking with L-suffixes is the preferred option, however.  \n The other option for fleshing out the object paradigm is that found in \nAmadiya, namely extending A-suffixation from the J-stem. The basis for \nthis extension would have been the fact that the in the older system, the two \novert P-stem suffixes have exact correspondences in the J-stem (having the \nsame source in the original gender-number markers), but in the role of \n  40\nobject rather than subject. The extension of the remaining A-stem suffixes \nwould then have been based on an extension of this principle of reversal to \nall person-number values, presumably encouraged by the already-\nestablished reversal in the function of the L-suffixes across the two stems. \nThis contrasts with the development of dialects such as Hertevin, described \nabove, where this principle of reversal was not extended, instead being \nreplaced by a principle of morphologically consistent object marking.  \n The reanalysis that will have taken place in Amadiya becomes \nespecially clear when we look at the fate of the forms that lack overt \nsuffixation for either the A-series or the L-series. Let us first look at the A-\nseries. In the more archaic system, such as that found in Arbel, the reversal \nof subject and object values obtains for the overt suffixes, namely feminine \nsingular -a and plural -i (43a), but not for forms with a zero suffix (43b). \nRecall that with the J-stem, the zero suffix marks third person masculine \nsingular subject. If the principle of reversal applied here too, we would \nexpect the corresponding P-stem form to have a third person singular \nmasculine object, but it does not: it is interpreted as unspecified for object. \nIn Amadiya, on the other hand, this interpretation is available. \n \n  41\n(43)  J-stem P-stem, Arbel P-stem, Amadiya \n a. CaCC-a-le \n\u2018she Xs him\u2019 \nCCiC-a-le \n\u2018he Xed her\u2019 \n(same as Arbel) \n     \n b. CaCC-\u00d8-le \n\u2018he Xs him\u2019 \nCCiC-\u00d8-le \n\u2018he Xed\u2019 \nCC\u0268C-\u00d8-le \n\u2018he Xed (him)\u2019 \n \n Let us now look at cases where the L-suffix is lacking. With J-stems \nthis entails simply an absence of object marking. If the principle of reversal \nis applied to the P-stem, the result should be a form with object marking \n(corresponding morphologically to the J-stem subject), but no indication of \nsubject. In dialects such as that of Arbel, such a form is lacking (44). This is \nperhaps not surprising, if one considers that J-stem forms are all construed \nas having an overtly marked subject: in Arbel, this generalization is \nmaintained in the P-stem too. In Amadiya, however, the principle of \nreversal is applied here too, resulting in transitive forms with an unspecified \nsubject. That is, one could argue that the very process of reversal has created \na new function.  \n \n(44) J-stem P-stem, Arbel P-stem, Amadiya \n \nCaCC-a \n\u2018she Xs\u2019 \n*CCiC-a \n \nCCiC-a \n \u2018\u2026Xed her\u2019 \n \n  42\n The scenario just outline assumes that reversal was a mechanism for \ndiachronic change. It is another question whether, having wrought those \nchanges, it remains an active principle. In the dialect of Urmi, which has \nessentially the same system as Amadiya,7 it clearly has not. Four of the \ncorresponding affixes of the J-stem and the P-stem have diverged \nphonologically, e.g. J-stem \u0161adr-\u00edy-lux \u2018they send you\u2019 versus P-stem \u0161udr-\n\u00e9-lux \u2018you sent them\u2019 (Hoberman 1989: 105). This suggests that there is no \nlonger any active connection between the suffixes associated with the two \nstems, in spite of the fact that almost all of them are homophonous. \n In summary, the crucial points about the development of pronominal \nsuffixes in Amadiya are the following: \n\u2022 In most dialects, the object of a J-stem form and the subject of a P-stem \nform are both marked by an L-suffix. This homophony appears to have \nbeen coincidental: subjects of P-stem forms were originally construed as \npossessors, which were marked by L-suffixes, and objects were also \nmarked by L-suffixes. \n\u2022 J-stem and P-stem forms shared a set of gender-number markers, a \nlegacy of their participial origin. With J-stem forms they agreed with the \nsubject, with P-stem forms the patient (later object). This alternation in \ngrammatical role was a consequence of the alternation in argument \n                                                \n7\n The most significant difference is that Urmi lacks the P-stem forms illustrated in (44) \n(Hoberman 1989: 106).  \n  43\nstructure between the originally active J-stem and originally passive or \nstative P-stem. \n\u2022 These gender-number suffixes gave rise to a new set of subject suffixes \n(the A-suffixes) on J-stems, through the addition of further first and \nsecond person suffixes. The original bare gender-number suffixes now \nthird person only. This restriction to third person is carried over to the P-\nstem forms, where these suffixes mark the object. \n\u2022 This results in a system in which there is complete correspondence \nbetween the marking of the objects of J-stem forms and the subject of P-\nstems (L-suffixes), but only a partial overlap for the other arguments (A-\nsuffixes). That is, P-stem subject marking corresponds to J-stem object \nmarking, but P-stem object marking corresponds to J-stem subject \nmarking only for the third person. Otherwise, P-stem objects are not \nmarked inflectionally. \n\u2022 This gap in the paradigm may be filled in various ways. In particular, in \nAmadiya, the morphological reversal which obtains for part of the \nsystem is extended to the whole system, yielding a complete set of \nobject-marking A-suffixes for the P-stem. \n \n5 Polarity versus exchange rules \nThe examples reviewed in \u00a74 provide ample evidence that there is such a \nthing as a systematic morphological reversal. Now we can address the \n  44\nquestion of what they imply for morphological models. It is at this point that \nthe distinction between polarity and exchange rules becomes relevant, \nbecause it turns out that they are based on differing conceptualizations of the \nphenomenon. Polarity, in Hetzron\u2019s definition (see (3) above), is a \nproportional analogy, and hence a two-part operation. In the first part (45a), \nan alternation between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 is established for one context, and this is \ncompared to another context, where only one member of the alternation is \ndefined. The salient point extracted from the analogy is that the association \nof exponents and categories is switched across the two contexts. This allows \nthe proportion to be solved as in (45b). \n \n(45) a. A represents X : B represents Y :: B represents X : x \n b. x = A represents Y \n \nCrucially, this model treats the two alternations as unequal, with one in \nsome sense subordinate to the other.  \n By contrast, an exchange rule encodes the fully solved proportion, \nthereby treating both alternations as equivalent. The drawbacks of such an \nanalysis become apparent when one takes a closer look at the Luo material \ndiscussed in \u00a72. Recall that in Luo, voiceless noun stems are voiced in the \nplural and that voiced stems are devoiced, and that this has been represented \nas the exchange rule in (46). \n \n  45\n(46) \u03b1Voice \u0001 -\u03b1Voice\/plural in -e or -i          \n \nUnfortunately, most accounts fail to present all the relevant data. In fact, the \ntwo halves of the exchange behave differently. While devoicing of voiced \nstems in the plural occurs without exception, voicing of voiceless stems in \nthe plural is lexically specified:8 \n \n(47) Lexical specification of voicing alternation for \u2013Voice stems (Tucker \n1994: 128, 130) \n         alternating      non-alternating \nsingular  plural   singular  plural  \n\u014bet    \u014bede \u2018rib\u2019  \u014but   \u014bute \u2018neck\u2019 \nbuk   buge \u2018book\u2019  lak   leke \u2018tooth\u2019 \nko\u03b8   ke\u00f0e \u2018rain\u2019  ba\u03b8   ba\u03b8e \u2018side\u2019 \narip  aribe \u2018milky way\u2019  ip  ipe \u2018tail\u2019 \n \nThe exchange rule would then need to be modified as: \n \n(48) \u03b1Voice \u0001 -\u03b1Voice\/plural in -e or -i, except for \u014but, lak, ba\u03b8, ip... \n \n                                                \n8\n Tucker (1994: 130) specifically states that only voiceless consonants fail to undergo \nalternation. However, I have found one example in Tucker\u2019s grammar of a non-alternating \nvoiced noun, \u014budi \u2018neck (of meat)\u2019 ~ \u014bude (Tucker 1994: 131). Curiously, this forms a \ndoublet with the word  \u014but \u2018neck\u2019 given in (47), a non-alternating voiceless stem. \n  46\nIf represented in this way, there is no recognition of the fact that the \nexceptions affect only -Voice stems. The symmetry implied by the use of an \nexchange rule simply is not there. Rather, there are two rules that occupy \ndifferent positions in the grammar: one a devoicing rule that applies to all \nnouns, and the other a voicing rule that is lexically specified.9 This suggests \nthat if the two rules are to be related to each other, it is better to do so along \nthe lines sketched in (45), with the general devoicing rule corresponding to \n(45a), and the voicing rule as a lexically restricted analogical extension, \ncorresponding to (45b). \n Such a representation translates naturally into a model of diachronic \nchange. This is especially clear in the case of the Neo-Aramaic data \ndiscussed above in \u00a75.4, where we can trace the course of this analogical \nextension across the various dialects. The point of departure, shared by all \n                                                \n9\n In all likelihood this lexically restricted rule would need to be invoked only for a few \nitems. Luo consonants are regularly devoiced in final position. Most words to which the \nvoicing rule would apply are consonant final in the singular; in fact, Tucker (1994: 128, \n130) asserts outright that voicing only applies to stems ending in a consonant. This assertion \nis clearly belied by examples in his text (e.g. agoko from (5b) above), but the implication is \nthat the majority of voiceless stems end in a consonant in the singular. If these words are \nassumed to have an underlyingly voiced stem-final consonant, then the voicing alternation \nwould be phonologically automatic. Then, strictly speaking, the voicing rule would only be \nneeded for the small number of vowel-final nouns whose stem ends in a voiceless \nconsonant.  \n  47\nthe Northeast Neo-Aramaic dialects, was an alternation corresponding to the \nfirst part of the analogy in (45): with the P-stem, subjects are marked like \nobjects (49).  \n \n (49)  A-suffixes represent SUBJECT : L-suffixes  represent OBJECT :: L-suffixes \nrepresent SUBJECT... \n \nIn some dialects (e.g. Arbel or Qaraqosh) the statement in (49) remains as it \nstands, and the object is not marked on the P-stem form of the verb. In \nothers (e.g. Hertevin), the implications of the analogy are ignored, and \nobject marking with P-stem forms is the same as that with J-stem forms. In \nAmadiya, though, (49) is treated as a proportional analogy to be resolved on \nthe same principle as (45). Note that such a diachronic model has already \nbeen advanced by Speiser (1938: 201) for Semitic and Hollenbach (1976) \nfor Trique (see \u00a75.3 above).  \n \n6 Conclusion \nThe preceding sections have argued that systematic morphological reversals \nare a fact of language. The evidence from Neo-Aramaic suggests that there \nis a fairly straightforward diachronic explanation in terms of reanalysis and \nextension (Harris 2003). The phenomenon starts with some change that \nbrings about a distribution of forms within a paradigm which superficially \nlooks like a reversal. This pattern is noticed by language users, reanalyzed \n  48\nas the product of a systematic principle of reversal, and extended by analogy \nto other contexts.  \n Within morphological typology, morphological reversals can be seen \nas a possible corollary of deponency (Corbett, Baerman, Brown and \nHippisley 2006). Deponency in its canonical construal describes a lexically-\nspecified class of verbs in Latin which have the form of passives but the \nfunction of actives, and thus constitute a mismatch between morphological \nform and morphosyntactic value. The mismatch is unidirectional: these \nverbs have active forms which look like passives, but they do not have a \nmirror-image set of passive forms that look like actives.. The relationship \nbetween this unidirectional mismatch and complete morphological reversals \nis clearly illustrated by the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects: in all of \nthem, object suffixes are used for subjects with the P-stem. In most of the \ndialects it remains a unidirectional mismatch, while in Amadiya the inverse \ncorrelation has been implemented.  \n As a final point, one is tempted to speculate whether there are any \nconstraints on morphological reversals. The diachronic model sketched \nabove does not suggest that there should, but it does presuppose that at least \nthe beginnings of a pattern of reversal must already be in place. This might \nnot limit the type of reversals we would expect to find, but would \npresumably limit the frequency with which we found them. One question \nthe model above does not address is how much of a pattern must already be \n  49\nin place for it to be noticed as such by language users. It would be \nreasonable to speculate that there are some cognitive limits, but I dare make \nno proposals here. The question remains one for future empirical research. \n  50\nAppendix: annotations to Table 1. \n1. The anteriority suffix -wa intervenes between A- and L-suffixes, thus \nthe J-stem qam-preterite qam-mp al\n\u0004 t\u0004\n-ax-lu  \u2018we removed them\u2019 \ncorresponds to the plupreterite qam-mp al\n\u0004 t\u0004\n-ax-wa-lu \u2018we had removed \nthem\u2019 (Hoberman 1989: 95-96). \n2. The initial l- of the L-suffixes is regularly assimilated to a final coronal \nconsonant of an immediately preceding A-suffix.  \n3. The P-stem forms shown in the first column, i.e. the P-stem forms with \nA-suffixes only, imply an unspecified agent, often interpreted as third \nperson plural animate (Hoberman 1989: 112).  \n4. P-stem forms of the first conjugation with a zero ending have the \noptional suffix -\u0268n (Hoberman 1989: 31). This is the one deviation from \nthe otherwise parallel system of pronominal suffixation in the J- and P-\nstem forms. Its function is unclear, but it may be phonologically \nmotivated: it is monosyllabic, while all the forms one might compare it \nto are disyllabic: the J-stem form with zero ending (e.g. kpat\u0268x), as well \nas the P-stem form with zero ending of the second conjugation  (e.g. \nm\u0161od\u0268r \u2018\u2026sent him\u2019). Note that in the dialect of Hertevin, Jastrow \n(1988: 53) describes a meaningless ending -ek which is optionally \nsuffixed to any monosyllabic verb form, typically in prepausal position. \n \n \n  51\nReferences \nAlderete, J. 2001.
