INTRODUCTION 25\u00a0\nUranium has three naturally occurring isotopes: 238U (t1\/2 \u2248 4.5 \u00d7 109 a) (JAFFEY et al., 1971), 26\u00a0\n235U (t1\/2 \u2248 7.0 \u00d7 108 a) (JAFFEY et al., 1971) and the shorter-lived 234U (t1\/2 \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 105 a) 27\u00a0\n(CHENG et al., 2000).  Until recently, the present-day 238U\/235U ratio has been considered 28\u00a0\ninvariant as mass-dependent thermodynamic isotopic fractionations were not expected to be 29\u00a0\ndetectable in U due to its high mass.  However, recent studies suggest U isotopic 30\u00a0\nfractionation in terrestrial materials is possible as a result of oxidation-reduction reactions 31\u00a0\n(UVI to\/from UIV) and\/or nuclear field shift (BIGELEISEN, 1996; BUCHACHENKO, 2001; 32\u00a0\nSCHAUBLE, 2007), and its presence has been confirmed in natural systems (BOPP et al., 2009; 33\u00a0\nSTIRLING et al., 2007; WEYER et al., 2008).  Thus, it is crucial to re-evaluate the 238U\/235U of 34\u00a0\nstandards for which the consensus value 238U\/235U value (\u2261 137.88) has been considered 35\u00a0\naccurate and often used with zero uncertainty. 36\u00a0\nNatural (processed) and synthetic uranium reference materials are employed in isotope ratio 37\u00a0\nand isotope dilution mass spectrometry to assess performance and accuracy and provide 38\u00a0\nbenchmark isotopic compositions for calibration purposes.  Examples include monitoring 39\u00a0\nmass fractionation and\/or detector bias (CHENG et al., 2000), developing gravimetric 40\u00a0\nreference solutions for isotopic tracer calibration ((233U \u00b1 235U \u00b1 236U)\/(Th \u00b1 Pb)) (CHENG et 41\u00a0\nal., 2000; CONDON et al., 2007; RODDICK et al., 1987), and use as a reference for studies that 42\u00a0\ndocument the variability of uranium isotopic composition of natural (terrestrial and 43\u00a0\nmeteoritic) materials (AMELIN et al., 2010; BOPP et al., 2009; BRENNECKA et al., 2010; 44\u00a0\nSTIRLING et al., 2007; STIRLING et al., 2005; WEYER et al., 2008).  The uranium reference 45\u00a0\nmaterials available for these purposes are either derived from ore deposits or are synthesized 46\u00a0\nby mixing highly enriched isotopes to achieve desired ratios.  We use the term \u2018natural 47\u00a0\nuranium\u2019 for reference materials derived from uranium ores and\/or minerals.  However, it is 48\u00a0\npossible pre-existing intra-ore variation has been homogenized, and isotopic fractionation 49\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nmay have occurred during processing, so that the isotopic composition of the processed 50\u00a0\nnatural uranium differs from the parent ore.  Natural uranium reference materials are typically 51\u00a0\nconsidered to have an invariant isotopic composition, and their 238U\/235U is taken to be the 52\u00a0\n\u2018consensus\u2019 238U\/235U value equal to 137.88 (STEIGER and JAGER, 1977).  The isotopic 53\u00a0\ncomposition of synthetic isotopic reference materials are determined gravimetrically by 54\u00a0\nweighing high purity isotopes (as oxides) prior to mixing, or through cross-calibration against 55\u00a0\ngravimetric isotopic reference materials (CATANZARO et al., 1968; RICHTER et al., 2008).  56\u00a0\nIn this contribution, we present new 238U\/235U determinations for a series of commonly used 57\u00a0\nnatural and synthetic uranium reference materials.  These measurements were made using a 58\u00a0\n233U-236U double spike (IRMM 3636) to accurately correct for mass fractionation during 59\u00a0\nanalysis.  The 233U\/236U ratio of IRMM 3636 was determined gravimetrically with an 60\u00a0\nuncertainty of 160 ppm, coverage factor of k = 2 (2\uf073) (RICHTER et al., 2008).  Combined with 61\u00a0\nhigh-precision, high-accuracy, thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) we are able to 62\u00a0\ndetermine 238U\/235U ratios of these reference materials with a combined standard uncertainty 63\u00a0\nof <200 ppm (95% confidence limit).  Quantifying the 238U\/235U ratio and associated 64\u00a0\nuncertainty for these reference materials will require adjusting the results of previous 65\u00a0\ninstrumental and tracer calibration efforts; if the radiogenic 238U\/235U of U-daughter (U-Pb 66\u00a0\nand U-series) geochronology samples is different from 137.88, small systematic errors will 67\u00a0\nresult. 68\u00a0\n 69\u00a0\n2. NATURAL URANIUM 238U\/235U RATIO 70\u00a0\nA compilation of ninety gas source mass spectrometry 238U\/235U determinations on uranium 71\u00a0\nhexafluoride (UF6) was used to indicate a lack of variation in natural 238U\/235U ratios at the 72\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nsub per-mil level (COWAN and ADLER, 1976; STEIGER and JAGER, 1977).  The measurements 73\u00a0\nwere made in five laboratories on a variety of uranium ore bodies (COWAN and ADLER, 74\u00a0\n1976).  Examination of the original data reveals a bimodal distribution (noted by Cowan and 75\u00a0\nAdler, 1976), and a mean value >137.88 (Fig 1).  Furthermore, all data in this compilation 76\u00a0\nwere normalised to an NBS standard (unnamed, from the Belgian Congo) for which a value 77\u00a0\nof 0.7110 weight percent 235U (equivalent to 238U\/235U =137.88) was used.  Critically, a 78\u00a0\npersonal communication and an unpublished report are the only sources cited in Cowan and 79\u00a0\nAdler (1976) for the isotopic composition of the NBS standard used for normalization.  Thus, 80\u00a0\nthe accuracy of the 238U\/235U value in the Cowan and Alder (1976) compilation cannot be 81\u00a0\ntraced back to the SI system of units and its uncertainty cannot be quantified.  For the 82\u00a0\npurposes of U-daughter geochronology, the IUGS subcommission proposed the adoption of a 83\u00a0\n\u2018consensus value\u2019 of 238U\/235U = 137.88, based largely upon the Cowan and Adler (1976) 84\u00a0\ncompilation (STEIGER and JAGER, 1977) and this value has been and is currently widely used 85\u00a0\nin the geochronology community.   86\u00a0\nFor the past three decades, researchers have been measuring the 238U\/235U of various sources 87\u00a0\nof natural uranium to assess whether it is truly invariant.  In the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s 88\u00a0\nseveral pioneering studies (CHEN and WASSERBURG, 1980; CHEN and WASSERBURG, 1981b; 89\u00a0\nTATSUMOTO and SHIMAMURA, 1980)  focused on determining the uranium isotopic 90\u00a0\ncomposition of meteorites, using 233U-236U tracers to facilitate accurate correction for mass 91\u00a0\nfractionation during mass spectrometry. The 233U\/236U ratio of the double spikes used in these 92\u00a0\nstudies were calibrated against CRM U500, and thus given the sample sizes and analytical 93\u00a0\ncapability of the time could assess variation at the 0.5% level (CHEN and WASSERBURG, 94\u00a0\n1981b).  A summary of their measurements on two terrestrial standards, NBS 950a and the 95\u00a0\nwell-known Columbia River basalt whole-rock geochemistry standard BCR-1, showed that 96\u00a0\nthe terrestrial material 238U\/235U of 137.85 \u00b1 0.4 (2\u03c3) was indistinguishable from the 97\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nconsensus value 137.88 (CHEN and WASSERBURG, 1981a).  They also demonstrated that data 98\u00a0\nfrom a variety of meteorites - including phosphates, CAI\u2019s, bulk meteorite fractions, and 99\u00a0\nleaches - had an average 238U\/235U of 137.83 \u00b1 0.55 (2\u03c3), leading them to conclude that any 100\u00a0\nvariation in the 238U\/235U of extraterrestrial materials must be at the \u22640.4% level.  101\u00a0\nIn contrast to the geological community\u2019s consensus 238U\/235U value, the 238U\/235U value 102\u00a0\ncurrently recommended by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) is 103\u00a0\n137.80 (mole fraction 235U = 0.007 204(6)) (DE LAETER et al., 2003).  The IUPAC value is 104\u00a0\nbased upon UF6 measurements of six natural uranium ore samples by gas-source mass 105\u00a0\nspectrometry (RICHTER et al., 1999).  These data are calibrated against gravimetrically 106\u00a0\nprepared synthetic isotope reference materials that are traceable to a fundamental SI unit.  107\u00a0\nSubsequently, Richter et al. (2008) and Keegan et al. (2008) obtained high precision TIMS 108\u00a0\ndata, which support the current IUPAC 238U\/235U value (Figure 1), using a 233U-236U double 109\u00a0\nspike (IRMM 3636), which is also traceable to SI units and has a smaller uncertainty than 110\u00a0\nprevious double spike preparations. 111\u00a0\nRecent studies employing multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 112\u00a0\n(MC-ICPMS) have been able to resolve variation in 238U\/235U better than 0.01% (BOPP et al., 113\u00a0\n2009; BRENNECKA et al., 2010; STIRLING et al., 2005; STIRLING et al., 2007; WEYER et al., 114\u00a0\n2008).  A variety of rock types, and to a much lesser extent U-bearing minerals (STIRLING et 115\u00a0\nal., 2007; WEYER et al., 2008) have been examined, as well as revisiting some of the uranium 116\u00a0\nore bodies reported in the Cowan and Adler (1976) compilation (BOPP et al., 2009). In the 117\u00a0\ncase of the Bopp et al (2009) study, the data are normalized to IRMM REMEIP 18A, which 118\u00a0\nhas a certified isotope composition traceable to SI units (238U\/235U = 137.85 \u00b1 0.05%, 119\u00a0\n(RICHTER et al., 2007).  Importantly, the Bopp et al. (2009) study included a suite of uranium 120\u00a0\nores from the Cowan and Adler (1976) compilation and obtained 238U\/235U values that are 121\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(systematically) 0.1 to 0.05% lower than 137.88 (Figure 1).  Stirling et al (STIRLING et al., 122\u00a0\n2007; STIRLING et al., 2006) and Weyer et al (WEYER et al., 2008) use a \u201cnatural\u201d uranium 123\u00a0\nstandard (CRM 112a and SRM 950a, respectively) for normalization and present data as 124\u00a0\nfractional deviations from this standard material.  For studies that exploit 238U\/235U variation 125\u00a0\nas a redox-sensitive proxy, absolute 238U\/235U values are less important.  However, absolute 126\u00a0\n238U\/235U values are used in U-daughter geochronology, so the absolute value of the 127\u00a0\ncomparative reference material is important. 128\u00a0\n 129\u00a0\n3. URANIUM REFERENCE MATERIALS 130\u00a0\nA variety of natural uranium (derived from minerals and devoid of any synthetic uranium 131\u00a0\nisotopes) and synthetic uranium (derived from mixing highly enriched single isotopes) 132\u00a0\nreference materials are available and in widespread use within the isotope community.  The 133\u00a0\nsynthetic uraniums are isotope reference materials (IRM), whereas the \u2018natural\u2019 uraniums are 134\u00a0\neither metals, oxides and\/or solutions derived from the processing of natural uranium that are 135\u00a0\ncertified for purity\/concentration (such as CRM 112a, SRM 950a) or materials such as HU-1 136\u00a0\nstated to be in \u2018secular equilibrium\u2019.  We have chosen to study three natural (CRM 112a, 137\u00a0\nSRM 950a, HU-1) and two synthetic (CRM U500 and IRMM 184) reference materials that 138\u00a0\nare commonly employed in U-daughter geochronology for calibration of tracers, as isotopic 139\u00a0\nstandards for correcting bias effects during isotope ratio mass spectrometry (see discussion 140\u00a0\nbelow) and as a reference for 238U\/235U variation in terrestrial and meteoritic materials. 141\u00a0\n3. 1 CRM 112a. 142\u00a0\nCRM 112a is a high-purity metal assay standard formerly known as SRM 960.  There is also 143\u00a0\nan assay solution standard (CRM 145) which is derived from CRM 112a and hence it is 144\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nassumed to have the same isotopic composition. These CRMs were produced by NBS 145\u00a0\n(National Bureau of Standards) and are now distributed by New Brunswick Laboratory 146\u00a0\n(NBL, http:\/\/www.nbl.doe.gov\/).  The isotopic composition is not specified in the CRM 147\u00a0\ncertificate.  The CRM 112a solution used in this study was prepared at the NERC Isotope 148\u00a0\nGeoscience Laboratory (NIGL) in 2008 by dissolving the metal in a pre-cleaned Teflon FEP 149\u00a0\nbottle using high purity 2 M HNO3 prepared in a Picotrace Teflon double sub-boiling still. 150\u00a0\n3. 2 SRM 950a. 151\u00a0\nThis material consists of \u2018normal\u2019 uranium in the form U3O8 with uranium oxide mass 152\u00a0\nfraction of 99.94 \u00b1 0.02.  SRM 950a was produced by National Institute of Standards and 153\u00a0\nTechnology (NIST, http:\/\/www.nist.gov\/), and the isotopic composition is not specified in the 154\u00a0\ncertificate.  The SRM 950a solution used in this study was prepared at the British Geological 155\u00a0\nSurvey in 1978 using U3O8 powder from a previously unopened vial of SRM 950a dissolved 156\u00a0\nin 2 M HNO3 in a pre-cleaned 1 litre borosilicate glass flask. 157\u00a0\n3. 3 Harwell Uraninite (HU-1). 158\u00a0\n HU-1 was originally distributed by the UKAEA Harwell (Hoffmann et al. 2007) and is used 159\u00a0\nas a secular equilibrium standard by the U-series community (CHENG et al., 2000; HOFFMANN 160\u00a0\net al., 2007; LUDWIG et al., 1992).  There is no certification for this material.  TIMS and MC-161\u00a0\nICP-MS data measured for different aliquots sourced from different laboratories indicate that 162\u00a0\nHU-1 is homogeneous with respect to 234U\/238U at the \uf0a3 0.1% level, but may vary in 163\u00a0\n230Th\/238U as measured (ANDERSEN et al., 2008; CHENG et al., 2000; HOFFMANN et al., 2007) 164\u00a0\nThe HU-1 solution used in this study was prepared at NIGL in 1992 by dissolving material 165\u00a0\nobtained from M. Ivanovich (UKAEA) in a precleaned 1 litre FEP bottle using ~1 litre of 2M 166\u00a0\nHNO3 prepared by sub-boiling distillation in a Teflon two-bottle still. 167\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.4 IRMM 184. 168\u00a0\nIRMM 184 is a standard solution with a near natural uranium isotopic composition 235U\/238U 169\u00a0\n= 0.0072623(22) (238U\/235U = 137.697 \u00b1 0.041) and 234U\/238U = 0.000053138(32) (RICHTER 170\u00a0\net al., 2005).  This material was produced by, and is available from the Institute for Reference 171\u00a0\nMaterials and Measurements (IRMM, http:\/\/irmm.jrc.ec.europa.eu).  Measurements of the 172\u00a0\n238U\/235U ratio were performed on a UF6 gas mass spectrometer calibrated using synthetic 173\u00a0\nuranium isotope mixtures.  The minor isotope ratios were measured by TIMS and normalised 174\u00a0\nto the 238U\/235U ratio.  Calibration of this reference material is independent of the consensus 175\u00a0\nvalue of 238U\/235U = 137.88 that is commonly assumed for various natural uranium standards.  176\u00a0\nWe chose to analyse IRMM 184 as an internal check on the accuracy and reproducibility of 177\u00a0\nour TIMS measurements within the limits of the 0.03% uncertainty on the certified 238U\/235U 178\u00a0\nratio.   179\u00a0\n3.5 CRM U500.   180\u00a0\nCRM U500 is a synthetic uranium isotopic standard prepared from high-purity single 181\u00a0\nisotopes by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and now distributed by NBL 182\u00a0\n(http:\/\/www.nbl.doe.gov\/) to have 234U\/235U\/236U\/238U \u2248 0.01\/1\/0.0015\/1 (GARNER et al., 183\u00a0\n1971).  The 238U\/235U ratio was determined gravimetrically and therefore can be traced back 184\u00a0\nto the SI system of units.  The CRM U500 238U\/235U value of ~1 is certified with a maximum 185\u00a0\nuncertainty of 0.1% (GARNER et al., 1971).  This reference material is widely used by both 186\u00a0\nthe U-Pb and U-series community in applications where accuracy and uncertainty 187\u00a0\nquantification is a priority, such as in tracer calibrations (CHENG et al., 2000). It is noteworthy 188\u00a0\nthat routine analysis of CRM U500 by the MC-ICP-MS community is not as common as by 189\u00a0\nthe TIMS community because of the risk of \u2018memory effects\u2019, especially when operating in 190\u00a0\ndry plasma mode employing a desolvating nebuliser.  However, it is of critical importance to 191\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ncalibrations of double 233U-236U spikes, excluding the IRMM 3636 spike, and therefore 192\u00a0\ncurrently underpins MC-ICP-MS analyses in several U-series geochronology labs (CHENG et 193\u00a0\nal., 2000).   194\u00a0\nTwo batches of CRM U500 were used in this study.  The CRM U500 solution analysed at 195\u00a0\nNIGL was prepared at NIGL in 2004 by dissolving U3O8 powder from a previously unopened 196\u00a0\nvial of U500 in a pre-cleaned Teflon FEP bottle using high purity 2 M HNO3 prepared in a 197\u00a0\nPicotrace Teflon double sub-boiling still.  The CRM U500 solution analyzed at MIT was 198\u00a0\nprepared at Washington University in 1988 in a pre-cleaned Teflon bottle and high-purity 199\u00a0\nHNO3. 200\u00a0\n 201\u00a0\n4. EXPERIMENTAL (small font section) 202\u00a0\n4.1 IRMM 3636 double spike. 203\u00a0\nTo correct for mass-dependent fractionation during 238U\/235U ratio measurement, we have 204\u00a0\nemployed the IRMM 3636 233U-236U double spike with 233U\/236U = 1.01906 (RICHTER et al., 205\u00a0\n2008).  Derived from high-purity isotopes, its 233U\/236U ratio and uncertainty were 206\u00a0\ndetermined by gravimetric principles and therefore can be traced to the SI system of units 207\u00a0\n(RICHTER et al., 2008).  The abundance of 235U and 238U are low 235U\/236U = 0.000 045 480; 208\u00a0\n238U\/236U = 0.000234), but a correction is still required to strip the 235U and 238U contributions 209\u00a0\nfrom IRMM 3636 and calculate a sample 238U\/235U ratio (see Appendix 1).  The nature and 210\u00a0\npropagation of uncertainties associated with the isotopic composition of IRMM 3636a are 211\u00a0\ndiscussed in detail in section 4.3.  Although 236U has been reported to have been detected in 212\u00a0\nsome natural uranium samples (BERKOVITS et al., 2000) levels are extremely low (236U\/U \u2264 213\u00a0\n30e-11); however, some reference materials have elevated 236U concentrations from 214\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ncontamination during manufacture.  Berkovits et al. (2000) analysed different batches of 215\u00a0\nSRM 950 (950, 950a and 950b) and determined 236U\/U \u2248 8e-10 for batch 950a.  For the 216\u00a0\nsample\/tracer ratios used in this study this source of 236U is can be safely ignored. 217\u00a0\n4.2 Mass spectrometry. 218\u00a0\nMeasurements were performed on a ThermoFinnegan Triton TIMS instrument (Triton 2) at 219\u00a0\nNIGL and GV Isoprobe-T TIMS instrument at MIT.  Prior to sample loading, the filaments 220\u00a0\nwere outgassed for >40 minutes at between 1.5 and 4.5 amps (>20 minutes at 4.5 amps).  221\u00a0\nBatches of Re used for filaments were first checked in the mass spectrometer on the SEM at 222\u00a0\ntypical running temperatures to ensure U emitted directly from the outgassed Re was 223\u00a0\ninsignificant.  At NIGL, samples were loaded on zone-refined Re filaments in a double 224\u00a0\nfilament configuration in dilute HNO3 and slowly dried down at 0.5 \u2013 1.0 amps. During the 225\u00a0\nrun, ionisation filaments were heated to ~1700 - 1750\u02daC (4.6 to 5.4 amps) with the 226\u00a0\nevaporation filament at 1.8 to 2.4 amps, and the uranium ionized as U+ ions.  At MIT, 227\u00a0\nuranium was ionized as UO2+ on a single Re filament loaded in a Si Gel emitter 228\u00a0\n(GERSTENBERGER and HAASE, 1997) and real time correction for 233U16O18O interference on 229\u00a0\n235U16O16O was possible by measuring oxide species at masses 272 and 269. Details and 230\u00a0\nequations used for mass fractionation correction, oxide correction, and stripping of minor 231\u00a0\nisotope contributions are outlined for both labs in Appendix 1. 232\u00a0\nAt NIGL the abundance sensitivity, following the IUPAC recommended definition (TODD, 233\u00a0\n1991) as \u201cthe ratio of the maximum ion current recorded at a mass m to the ion current 234\u00a0\narising from the same species recorded at an adjacent mass (m \u00b1 1)\u201d, was determined by 235\u00a0\nmeasuring what are interpreted to be down-mass scattered ions from the 238U peak at m\/z = 236\u00a0\n237 and was ~1 ppm.  Considering the range of 236U\/235U measured for the \u2018natural\u2019 uranium 237\u00a0\nmaterials, the maximum effect in excess of amplifier-Faraday baseline on 235U by scattered 238\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n236U ions was ~8 ppm, small compared to our target total uncertainty and largely accounted 239\u00a0\nfor by the interpolated half-mass baseline measurements.  At MIT, abundance sensitivity was 240\u00a0\n< 3 ppm and the effects of scattered 236U ions on the 235U peak for the CRM U500 analyses 241\u00a0\nwere similarly accounted for.  Faraday amplifiers in both labs employed 1011 \u2126 resistors and 242\u00a0\namplifier electronic gains were measured <24 hours prior to analyses. Amplifier cup rotation 243\u00a0\nwas employed at NIGL to minimize biases arising from residual differences in amplifier 244\u00a0\nperformance\/gain.  Baselines were obtained at masses 232.55 and 233.55 as measured on the 245\u00a0\naxial Faraday (on-peak mass was 233.05), with on-peak corrections based on a linear 246\u00a0\ninterpolation of the half-mass baselines. Each baseline measurement was integrated over 60 247\u00a0\nseconds and taken before each data block, employing a delay of at least 10 seconds between 248\u00a0\nexposure of the Faraday amplifiers to an on-peak signal and the baseline measurements.  249\u00a0\nFurther details of mass spectrometry performance are listed in Appendix 2. 250\u00a0\nOur aim was to obtain 238U\/235U data with a total uncertainty of < 200 ppm, including the 251\u00a0\n~160 ppm contribution from the uncertainty of the IRMM 3636 tracer isotopic composition. 252\u00a0\nThis necessitates that the external reproducibility contribution from mass spectrometry be \u2264 253\u00a0\n120 ppm when combined in quadrature.  For standards with \u201cnatural\u201d isotopic compositions, 254\u00a0\nminimum 235U ion beam intensities for between 0.1-0.35 V (1-3.5 pA) ensured sufficient 255\u00a0\ncounting statistics, and the maximum 238U beam size was limited by the need to avoid 256\u00a0\namplifier saturation, corresponding to 238U >14V (140 pA) and <50V (500 pA) for natural U 257\u00a0\nand IRMM 184.   258\u00a0\nMeasurement of all tracer and sample isotopes required four Faraday cups and thus inter-cup 259\u00a0\nbiases were required to be relatively small.  Cup matching tests at NIGL using Nd isotopes 260\u00a0\nshow that these biases are on the order of ~10-20 ppm and therefore are not a limiting factor 261\u00a0\n(Appendix 2).  Furthermore, individual 1011 ohm amplifier responses at NIGL (i.e., signal 262\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ndecay) were checked by loading with a constant current source, demonstrating that all 263\u00a0\namplifiers achieved <10 ppm residual signal after 2 seconds, and verified by loading with 264\u00a0\nlarge ion beams, as measured on both a single Faraday cup and all required Faraday cup-265\u00a0\namplifier pair responses.  The ion beam signal decay experiments employed >40 V 238U 266\u00a0\nbeams, and determined that residual long term (>3 second magnet settling time) effects of 267\u00a0\nlarge ion beam exposure were not present. 268\u00a0\nSample\/spike mixing ratios for the natural uranium materials and IRMM 184 were optimised 269\u00a0\nto give 238U\/236U ratios between 25 and 120 in order to minimise potential for tailing of the 270\u00a0\n236U peak on the 235U peak in the mixture. In the case of CRM U500, the 238U\/236U of the 271\u00a0\nspike\/CRM mixes ranged from ~0.5 to ~10.  It is useful to note that U mass fractionation 272\u00a0\nanalysed by TIMS is typically \u22640.1%\/u, almost an order of magnitude smaller than that 273\u00a0\nobserved for MC-ICP-MS, and the correction is insensitive to the fractionation law used 274\u00a0\n(WASSERBURG et al., 1981). 275\u00a0\n4.3 Uncertainty estimation.   276\u00a0\n\u201cThere are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known 277\u00a0\nunknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don\u2019t know. But there are 278\u00a0\nalso unknown unknowns. These are things we do not know we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2013 D. Rumsfeld 279\u00a0\n(2002) 280\u00a0\nWe have attempted to identify and quantify the major sources of uncertainty in the 238U\/235U 281\u00a0\nmeasurements that arise from both random and systematic effects.  The quantifiable 282\u00a0\nuncertainty component due to random effects is largely from data acquisition, and comprises 283\u00a0\ncounting statistics on ion beams and baseline noise.  Known systematic contributions include 284\u00a0\nuncertainty in the isotopic composition of the IRMM 3636 tracer used for fractionation 285\u00a0\ncorrection, amplifier gain and collector efficiency differences, and the fractionation law used.   286\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReplicate determinations in a single laboratory do not reveal all potential sources of 287\u00a0\nsystematic error.  To quantify reproducibility, we performed an inter-laboratory comparison 288\u00a0\nof CRM U500 measurements at both NIGL and MIT.  The isotopic composition of CRM 289\u00a0\nU500 is amenable to higher precision determinations and therefore provides a means to 290\u00a0\nassess repeatability within each laboratory, and also resolve inter-laboratory bias at the level 291\u00a0\nof tens of ppm.  Reference materials with a natural isotopic composition were measured at 292\u00a0\nNIGL, and the combined CRM U500 data was used to estimate the full uncertainty budget, 293\u00a0\nwhich was applied to all determinations. 294\u00a0\nThe 238U\/235U determinations for the reference material\/IRMM 3636 mixtures are presented 295\u00a0\nin Table 2 and summarised in Table 4.  The analytical uncertainty reported for each mix is the 296\u00a0\nstandard error of the fractionation- and tracer-corrected 238U\/235U ratios, multiplied by a 297\u00a0\ncoverage factor of k = 2, following the approach and terminology of the Joint Committee for 298\u00a0\nGuides in Metrology (JCGM, 2008). This is equivalent to a ~95% confidence interval, or 2\u03c3 299\u00a0\nof a normal distribution, and is justified due to the large number of effective degrees of 300\u00a0\nfreedom for each measurement.  Each two step (see Table A2.1) measurement cycle\u2019s 301\u00a0\nfractionation- and tracer-corrected 238U\/235U measurement, represents an independent 302\u00a0\nmeasurement, with only systematic components of uncertainty from the tracer IC in common. 303\u00a0\nThe uncertainty contribution from the isotopic composition of IRMM 3636 from (RICHTER et 304\u00a0\nal., 2008) was assessed at the weighted mean level for each standard.  Because each weighted 305\u00a0\nmean includes mixes with sample\/spike ratios that vary by up to an order of magnitude, the 306\u00a0\ntracer subtraction uncertainty contribution is not constant.  Instead of adding a single standard 307\u00a0\nuncertainty in quadrature to the measurement uncertainty, we use a more sophisticated 308\u00a0\nalgorithm that computes the maximum likelihood of the weighted mean, its standard error, 309\u00a0\nand MSWD by treating the tracer uncertainty contributions to analyses as error correlations 310\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nbetween them (LYONS et al., 1988; VALASSI, 2003).  The generalized weighted mean 311\u00a0\nstatistics computed in this way incorporate the components of uncertainty from systematic 312\u00a0\nand random effects without incorrectly reducing systematic contributions during averaging.  313\u00a0\nThe uncertainty contribution from the IRMM 3636 isotopic composition, and in particular the 314\u00a0\nuncertainty in its 233U\/236U ratio, contributes >75% of the combined variance of each 315\u00a0\nweighted mean.   316\u00a0\nClose examination of the precise CRM U500 238U\/235U determinations from both labs 317\u00a0\nindicates that there are (at least) two additional sources of uncertainty.  First, both labs report 318\u00a0\nindividual measurement uncertainties that are too small to explain the variability between 319\u00a0\nmeasurements, which is reflected by the relatively high MSWDs (2.3 at MIT and 16.5 at 320\u00a0\nNIGL) of both large datasets.  This overdispersion, or \u201cexcess scatter,\u201d implies an 321\u00a0\nunrecognized or underestimated component of variability in the measurements, yet to be 322\u00a0\nidentified but potentially amplifier gain drift or other instrumental parameters.  One simple 323\u00a0\nway to estimate the magnitude of this missing component is to calculate the increase in 324\u00a0\nuncertainty required to bring the MSWD of each dataset to 1, and is 41 ppm for NIGL and 42 325\u00a0\nppm for MIT (2\u03c3).  Second, there is a significant difference (ca. 50 ppm) between the 326\u00a0\nweighted means for each lab outside these expanded measurement uncertainties.  There is no 327\u00a0\na priori reason to believe that one lab\u2019s results are more accurate so we must ascribe the 328\u00a0\ndifference to unrecognized mass spectrometer or method-dependent effects such as 329\u00a0\nmeasuring U as a metal (NIGL) vs. as an oxide (MIT).  An additional 65 ppm (2\u03c3) standard 330\u00a0\nuncertainty added in quadrature to both labs\u2019 weighted means brings the NIGL and MIT 331\u00a0\nCRM U500 weighted means into agreement within uncertainties and a MSWD of 1. 332\u00a0\n Two MSWDs are reported for each solution.  The first incorporates both the measurement 333\u00a0\nuncertainty, represented by the standard error of the fractionation-corrected ratios, and the 334\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nvariability caused by predictable systematic effects.  For example, the 238U\/236U ratio of the 335\u00a0\ntracer may be slightly higher than, but within uncertainty of, it\u2019s certified value.  In this case, 336\u00a0\nrelatively large sample\/tracer ratios would yield corrected 238U\/235U values that are too high, 337\u00a0\nand relatively small sample\/tracer ratios would yield even higher 238U\/235U values.  This 338\u00a0\nwould subtly increase the scatter between analyses with different sample\/tracer ratios, but the 339\u00a0\ntrend would not be resolvable at our level of precision.  Since the certified value is not 340\u00a0\nperfectly accurate, this source of variability must be included when determining whether the 341\u00a0\ndata are consistent with a single weighted mean.  The second MSWD is calculated after the 342\u00a0\nadding the intra-laboratory reproducibility (41 to 42 ppm) uncertainty term in quadrature to 343\u00a0\neach measurement to account for the overdispersion of the CRM U500 dataset. 344\u00a0\nIncluding data from two independent laboratories using two different methods increases our 345\u00a0\nconfidence in the measurements\u2019 accuracy and ensures its uncertainty estimate is realistic.  346\u00a0\nFor the other solutions analysed in a single laboratory, the combined standard uncertainty 347\u00a0\nmust include these two effects, as well as the measurement and tracer uncertainties.  We 348\u00a0\nconsider this the best estimate of the true external reproducibility of our experiment. 349\u00a0\n 350\u00a0\n5. RESULTS 351\u00a0\nThe results of the determinations are outlined below and listed in Tables 2 and 3.  The final 352\u00a0\nvalues and associated uncertainties are summarised in Table 4.  Uncertainties of the 238U\/235U 353\u00a0\nratio means are presented as \u00b1X\/Y.  The X uncertainty is our best estimate of the external 354\u00a0\nreproducibility, twice the standard error of the weighted mean measurement uncertainty 355\u00a0\ncombined in quadrature with the intra- and inter-laboratory components (see section 4.3).  356\u00a0\nThe Y uncertainty includes these combined with the propagated systematic uncertainty in the 357\u00a0\n233U\/236U ratio and minor isotope composition of the IRMM 3636 double spike. In the case of 358\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nU500 and IRMM 184, Y also includes the uncertainty in the 236U\/235U ratio of the standard 359\u00a0\nsolution, all added in quadrature (JCGM, 2008).  The MSWDs are reported as A\/B, where A 360\u00a0\nincorporates only measurement (without intra- and inter-laboratory components included) 361\u00a0\nand tracer variability and B incorporates the extra sources of variability inferred and 362\u00a0\nestimated from the CRM U500 data.  The observation that the re-calculated MSWDs for 363\u00a0\nreference materials with natural composition are between 0.5 and 1.9, values that are 364\u00a0\nacceptable for the given sample sizes (WENDT and CARL, 1991), supports applying the CRM 365\u00a0\nU500-based external reproducibility to the reference materials with natural 238U\/235U 366\u00a0\ncompositions.  367\u00a0\n5.1 CRM 112a.   368\u00a0\nSeven CRM 112a\/IRMM 3636 mixes were analysed with a weighted mean 238U\/235U value of 369\u00a0\n137.844 \u00b1 0.011\/0.024, MSWD = 2.0\/0.6 (2\uf073 absolute).   370\u00a0\n5.2 SRM 950a 371\u00a0\nSix SRM 950a\/IRMM 3636 mixes were analysed with a weighted mean 238U\/235U value of 372\u00a0\n137.847 \u00b1 0.011\/0.024, MSWD = 1.0\/0.5 (2\uf073 absolute).  These data show that CRM 112a has 373\u00a0\na 238U\/235U indistinguishable from SRM 950a; however, the two materials do have 374\u00a0\nsignificantly different 234U\/238U ratios (CHEN et al., 1986). 375\u00a0\n5.3 Harwell Uraninite (HU-1). 376\u00a0\nSix HU-1\/IRMM 3636 mixes were analysed with a weighted mean 238U\/235U value of 377\u00a0\n137.769 \u00b1 0.011\/0.024, MSWD = 3.1\/1.2 (2\uf073 absolute).  Our results for HU-1 relative to 378\u00a0\nCRM 112a (\u03b5235UCRM 112a = 5.5 \u00b1 1.1, 2\u03c3) where \u03b5235U = 104 \u00d7 379\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[(235U\/238Usample\/235U\/238Ustandard) \u2013 1], are in good agreement with those of (STIRLING et al., 380\u00a0\n2007) who documented \u03b5235UCRM 112a of 5.6 \u00b1 0.9 for the HU-1 standard.  381\u00a0\n5.4 IRMM 184.   382\u00a0\nFive IRMM 184\/IRMM 3636 mixes were analysed with a weighted mean 238U\/235U value of 383\u00a0\n137.682 \u00b1 0.011\/0.024, MSWD = 4.3\/1.9 (2\uf073 absolute).  This result is 109 ppm lower than 384\u00a0\ncertified value 238U\/235U = 137.697 but within the certified 300 ppm uncertainty which is 385\u00a0\nbased upon UF6 gas source mass spectrometry calibrated against synthetic uranium isotope 386\u00a0\nmixtures (RICHTER et al., 2005).   387\u00a0\n5.5 CRM U500. 388\u00a0\n238U\/235U.  A total of 38 CRM U500\/IRMM 3636 mixes were run at both NIGL and MIT.  389\u00a0\nNIGL determined a weighted mean 238U\/235U ratio of 0.999758 \u00b1 0.000077\/0.00017, MSWD 390\u00a0\n= 16.5\/1.0 and MIT a weighted mean 238U\/235U of 0.999805 \u00b1 0.000078\/0.00017, MSWD = 391\u00a0\n2.3\/1.0 (2\uf073 absolute) (Tables 1 and 2).  A weighted mean of the combined NIGL and MIT 392\u00a0\ndataset, including intra- and inter-laboratory uncertainties (see section 4.3) results in 393\u00a0\n238U\/235U = 0.99978 \u00b1 0.00016 (2\uf073 absolute).  This 238U\/235U value is ~520 ppm lower than 394\u00a0\nthe certified value of 1.0003 but well within the stated 1000 ppm uncertainty (GARNER et al., 395\u00a0\n1971). 396\u00a0\n234U\/235U and 236U\/235U.  Six non-spiked aliquots of CRM U500 were analysed as metal 397\u00a0\n(with 236U intensity >10mV) using our new 235U\/238U value (see above) for internal mass bias 398\u00a0\ncorrection in order to determine the 234U and 236U abundances (see Table 3).  234U\/235U and 399\u00a0\n236U\/235U of 0.010 418 10 \u00b1 0.000 000 30\/0.000 000 62, MSWD = 19.5\/1.0 and 0.001 5190 400\u00a0\n54 \u00b1 0.000 000 22\/0.000 000 23, MSWD = 15.6\/1.0 (2\uf073 absolute), respectively, were 401\u00a0\nobtained.  These ratios are 0.02% and 0.22% lower than 234U\/235U and 236U\/235U determined 402\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nby NBL-modified total evaporation and normalized to 235U\/238U = 0.999698 (RICHTER and 403\u00a0\nGOLDBERG, 2003).  These differences increase to 0.095% and 0.26% if the NBL data are 404\u00a0\nnormalized to the NIGL 235U\/238U value.  In contrast, the NIGL data are nearly identical to 405\u00a0\nthe original NBS certificate values (0.010422 \u00b1 0.18% and 0.0015195 \u00b1 0.41%). 406\u00a0\n 407\u00a0\n6. DISCUSSION 408\u00a0\nNew values for the 238U\/235U ratios of these reference materials have implications for U-409\u00a0\nseries, U-Pb and Pb-Pb geochronology, tracer calibrations, and nuclear forensics. These 410\u00a0\ninclude the magnitude of routine instrumental mass bias corrections using internal 411\u00a0\nnormalization or double spiking, as well as the precision and accuracy of both isotopic tracer 412\u00a0\ncalibrations and the 234U and 235U decay constants.  For U-Pb geochronology, if the parent U 413\u00a0\nisotopes show the same spread in modern 238U\/235U ratios, then using the consensus value of 414\u00a0\n137.88 will result in small systematic errors in age calculations. For U-Th geochronology the 415\u00a0\nimpact of uncertainty in the 238U\/235U value of reference materials used for both tracer 416\u00a0\ncalibration, and correction of instrumental mass fractionation effects, is explored by Stirling 417\u00a0\net al (2007). 418\u00a0\n6.1 Mass bias correction. 419\u00a0\nThe term mass bias is taken here to be the sum of all mass-dependent isotopic effects related 420\u00a0\nto mass spectrometry, including both the source and detector.  Uranium isotopic standards are 421\u00a0\nused to make mass bias corrections during mass spectrometry in three ways: (1) Internal 422\u00a0\nnormalization (TIMS and ICP-MS) employs a \u201cknown\u201d isotope ratio (e.g. 238U\/235U) to 423\u00a0\ndetermine mass bias during the run and to correct the isotope ratio of interest (e.g. 234U\/235U).  424\u00a0\n(2) Sample-standard bracketing (ICP-MS) is based on analyzing a standard or reference with 425\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\na \u201cknown\u201d isotope ratio to determine the mass bias drift during an analytical session and 426\u00a0\nalternated with unknowns.  The mass bias in the unknown samples is calculated by 427\u00a0\ninterpolation from the standard measurements.  (3) \u201cDouble-spiking\u201d (TIMS and ICP-MS) 428\u00a0\ninvolves adding two synthetic and\/or enriched isotopes (e.g., 233U, 235U, 236U) of known 429\u00a0\nrelative abundance to the sample, allowing mass bias to be corrected during the measurement 430\u00a0\nratio by ratio. \u201cDouble-spike\u201d tracers require calibration against standard reference materials, 431\u00a0\nwhich limits the accuracy of this approach.  Our new 238U\/235U values for a number of 432\u00a0\ncommonly used standards allow us to assess the impact of this assumption on the accuracy of 433\u00a0\nthe resultant determinations.   434\u00a0\nFor 238U\/235U studies, e.g. forensic studies of nuclear materials, the absolute error in the 435\u00a0\nmeasured 238U\/235U ratio should include and be no less than that of the reference material 436\u00a0\n238U\/235U ratio, regardless of the approach taken to constrain mass bias.  In U-series 437\u00a0\ngeochronology by ICP-MS, the 234U\/238U ratio is often determined using either natural 438\u00a0\nuranium reference materials (CRM 112a, SRM 950a, HU-1) for sample-standard external 439\u00a0\nbracketing, or by internally measuring the 238U\/235U in the sample material, provided the 233U 440\u00a0\nor 236U tracer is relatively pure.  In both cases, a value of 137.88 has been used for 441\u00a0\nnormalization.  In U-series, many U-Th laboratory tracers are calibrated using the assumed 442\u00a0\nsecular equilibrium value of HU-1, and using 137.88 for 238U\/235U to correct for mass bias.  443\u00a0\nUsing HU-1 for mass bias correction of the 238U\/234U ratio (\u0394u \u2248 4) by standard-sample 444\u00a0\nbracketing using an assumed 238U\/235U value of 137.88 will result in an inaccuracy of 445\u00a0\n~ 0.027 %\/u, which results in an error of ~ 0.1% for the corrected 238U\/234U ratio.  HU-1 is 446\u00a0\noften used as a check on Faraday\/ion-counting calibrations as well, using the assumed 447\u00a0\n238U\/235U value to correct for mass bias.  This may not be a critical issue when dating material 448\u00a0\nto routine precision or when open system behaviour controls data quality, but inaccuracies 449\u00a0\narising from consensus value normalization will impact high precision chronologies.  Stirling 450\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\net al. (2007) further discuss the impact of deviation from the consensus 238U\/235U value for 451\u00a0\nmass bias corrections. 452\u00a0\nThe 238U\/235U ratio of CRM U500 determined here is within the stated 0.1% uncertainty of 453\u00a0\nthe certified value (GARNER et al., 1971).  Our new value, however, is 0.05% lower and the 454\u00a0\ncombined standard uncertainty is reduced to 0.02%.  Because the 238U\/235U ratio of CRM 455\u00a0\nU500 is determined gravimetrically, it has been used for high-accuracy calibration of 233U-456\u00a0\n235U (CONDON et al., 2007) and 233U-236U tracers (CHENG et al., 2000) for U-daughter 457\u00a0\ngeochronology.  In the calibration of 233U-235U and 233U-236U double spikes, the systematic 458\u00a0\n0.1% uncertainty in the 238U\/235U ratio of CRM U500 results in systematic uncertainties of 459\u00a0\n0.07% and 0.1% for the derived the 233U\/235U (\u0394u \u2248 2) and 233U\/236U (\u0394u \u2248 3) double spike 460\u00a0\nratios respectively (0.033%\/u) and therefore a 0.1% uncertainty in resultant 238U\/235U 461\u00a0\ndeterminations and 0.13% uncertainty in 234U\/238U determinations.  Reducing the CRM U500 462\u00a0\n238U\/235U ratio uncertainty from 0.1% to 0.02% will reduce the uncertainty of 233U\/235U and 463\u00a0\n233U\/236U double spikes calibrated against CRM U500 significantly and thus reduce the 464\u00a0\ncombined standard uncertainty of sample determinations.  465\u00a0\n6.2 U-daughter tracer calibration. 466\u00a0\nUranium reference materials are relied upon for the calibration of the synthetic isotopic tracer 467\u00a0\n(236U \u00b1 235U \u00b1 233U \u00b1 229Th \u00b1 205Pb \u00b1 202Pb) that is used for isotope dilution measurements.  468\u00a0\nThe impact of inaccuracies in the 238U\/235U ratio of various references materials on 469\u00a0\ncalibration of a (mixed) U-daughter solution is dependent in on the detailed experimental 470\u00a0\napproach.  471\u00a0\nAccurate calibration of a tracer to be used for isotope dilution purposes requires mixing the 472\u00a0\ntracer with a gravimetric reference solution of known concentration and isotopic composition.  473\u00a0\nFor most uranium-based tracers, a gravimetric solution of a reference metal (e.g., CRM 112a) 474\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nwith known purity is used.  When the tracer and reference solution are mixed, a common 475\u00a0\napproach is to use the (assumed) isotopic composition of the reference material to correct for 476\u00a0\nfractionation of the tracer\/gravimetric solution mixture in order to accurately determine the 477\u00a0\nconcentration of the tracer isotope relative to the reference isotope.  In such an approach the 478\u00a0\nuncertainty in the isotopic composition of the reference material will result in inaccurate 479\u00a0\nfractionation correction as described above (section 6.1); resulting is an inaccurate tracer 480\u00a0\nconcentration estimate.  For instance, calibrating a 233U tracer using a 238U\/235U ratio of 481\u00a0\n137.88 for CRM 112a to correct the 238U\/233U of the mixture results in a 233U concentration 482\u00a0\ntoo low by 0.05% if isotopic fractionation is 1%\/u, and if HU-1 was used this inaccuracy 483\u00a0\nwould increase to 0.15%.  484\u00a0\nWhen a double uranium tracer is used (i.e., 233U-236U) the ratio of enriched isotopes can be 485\u00a0\ncalibrated independently of the concentration calibration.  This ratio can then be used to 486\u00a0\ncorrect for mass fractionation of the tracer\/gravimetric solution mixture.  Both the 487\u00a0\nconcentration and composition of different certified reference materials are thus exploited, as 488\u00a0\nin the recent calibration of the EARTHTIME U-Pb tracer (CONDON et al., 2007).  In this 489\u00a0\nexample, CRM U500 was used to determine the 233U\/235U ratio of the tracer, which in turn 490\u00a0\nwas used for mass bias correction of the tracer\/gravimetric solution mixture measurements 491\u00a0\nused to determine the concentration of the tracer isotopes.  The 0.1% uncertainty in the 492\u00a0\n238U\/235U ratio of CRM U500 propagated into a 0.066% uncertainty in the 233U\/235U double 493\u00a0\nspike ratio which in turn resulted in a 0.1% uncertainty in the moles of 235U in the tracer 494\u00a0\nrelative to the gravimetric isotope of 238U; this uncertainty contributes ca. 50% of the total 495\u00a0\nuncertainty in the U\/Pb ratio of the tracer (CONDON et al., 2007).  The new CRM U500 496\u00a0\n238U\/235U data presented herein results in a significant (ca. 50%) reduction in the U\/Pb ratio 497\u00a0\nuncertainty of the EARTHTIME U\/Pb tracer which translates to a ca. 50% reduction in 498\u00a0\nsample U\/Pb ratio uncertainty.  499\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother common approach used by some U-series workers is to calibrate mixed U-Th tracers 500\u00a0\nagainst natural materials considered to be in secular equilibrium. For example, HU-1 is 501\u00a0\nconsidered to be in secular equilibrium, an assumption supported for, in part, U isotopes by 502\u00a0\ndirect measurement (CHENG et al., 2000), and is used to calibrate the U\/Th ratio of mixed 503\u00a0\n229Th-236U or 229Th-233U-236U tracers when gravimetric calibration solutions for both U and 504\u00a0\nTh are not used (e.g. HENDERSON and SLOWEY, 2000; LUDWIG et al., 1992).  The inaccuracy 505\u00a0\nof the consensus 238U\/235U value relative to our determined 238U\/235U value (0.027%\/u) will 506\u00a0\nimpart an inaccuracy in the tracer (236U) concentration if the 238U\/235U ratio of HU-1 is used 507\u00a0\nto correct for mass fractionation during the calibration.  The magnitude of this bias will 508\u00a0\ndepend upon the nature of the tracer calibration experiment, which will vary between 509\u00a0\nlaboratories but is on the order of 0.03% to 0.05%. 510\u00a0\n6.3 Impact on inter-calibration of U decay constants. 511\u00a0\nSeveral key studies have demonstrated the potential for inter-calibrating the uranium (and 512\u00a0\nuranium-series) decay constants by analyzing \u201cclosed-system\u201d minerals (CHENG et al., 2000; 513\u00a0\nMATTINSON, 2000; SCHOENE et al., 2006; MATTINSON, 2010).  The current \u03bb234U value 514\u00a0\n(CHENG et al., 2000) was determined by measuring secular equilibrium 234U\/238U ratios using 515\u00a0\na 233U-236U double spike calibrated against the certified 238U\/235U value for CRM U500.  The 516\u00a0\ncalculation assumes the consensus 238U\/235U ratio for U in secular equilibrium in zircons, 517\u00a0\ncalcite and HU-1 where the 238U\/234U was calculated from a 234U\/235U measurement and 518\u00a0\nassumed 238U\/235U =137.88.    The original data of Cheng et al. (2000) could be used in 519\u00a0\nconjunction with the new data presented here to determine more accurate and precise decay 520\u00a0\nconstant values.  The most important change would be a reduction in the propagated 521\u00a0\nuncertainty on the 234U decay constant arising from the newly determined reduced uncertainty 522\u00a0\nfor CRM U500 235U\/238U.  Cheng et al. (2000) also made 230Th\/238U determinations on these 523\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nclosed system materials and used these to solve for \u03bb230Th.  The 230Th\/238U ratio 524\u00a0\ndetermination is underpinned by the gravimetric calibration of 229Th and 233U-236U tracers and 525\u00a0\ntherefore the reference materials against which the concentration and isotopic composition of 526\u00a0\nthe tracers are calibrated will directly affect the tracer Th\/U ratio and derived 230Th\/238U ratio 527\u00a0\nof the closed system materials.  As such the new 238U\/235U determinations for CRM 112a and 528\u00a0\nCRM U500 will impact the \u03bb230Th determination however without detailed information for 529\u00a0\nthe tracer calibration exercise it is not possible to quantify the affect these new reference 530\u00a0\nvalues will have. 531\u00a0\nHigh-precision analyses of demonstrably closed-system materials (zircon) have also been 532\u00a0\nexploited to derive a more accurate and precise \u03bb235U (MATTINSON, 2000; SCHOENE et al., 533\u00a0\n2006; MATTINSON, 2010).   In this approach, the systematic disagreement between 206Pb-238U 534\u00a0\ndates and 207Pb-235U dates is minimized by solving for a new value of \u03bb235U relative to the 535\u00a0\nmore precisely determined \u03bb238U of Jaffey et al (1971).  Many of the potential uncertainties 536\u00a0\noutlined above for tracer calibrations and fractionation corrections arising from assumed 537\u00a0\n238U\/235U = 137.88 for natural uranium reference materials were not fully explored in these 538\u00a0\nstudies.  Furthermore, nearly all U-Pb determinations rely in part upon the assumption of the 539\u00a0\n238U\/235U ratio in zircons is equal to 137.88 (usually with zero uncertainty).  The impact of 540\u00a0\nthis assumption in light of our new data is explored below.    541\u00a0\n6.4 Impact on U-Pb geochronology 542\u00a0\nThe new 238U\/235U determinations reported here allow us to calculate absolute 238U\/235U 543\u00a0\nratios for materials that have been previously determined relative to reference materials 544\u00a0\n(BRENNECKA et al., 2010; STIRLING et al., 2007; STIRLING et al., 2006).  For materials that are 545\u00a0\nalso used for U-Pb and Pb-Pb geochronology, we can use these absolute values to explore the 546\u00a0\npotential effect on age determinations and associated uncertainties.   For example, Stirling et 547\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nal., (2007) obtained 238U\/235U data on HNO3 leaching experiment of zircon from a 900 Ma 548\u00a0\npegmatite and obtained \u03b5235UCRM 112a values similar to those obtained on HU-1 indicating a 549\u00a0\n238U\/235U value for that zircon that is less than 137.88. 550\u00a0\nIn general the U-Pb geochronology community uses the \u2018consensus value\u2019 of 238U\/235U = 551\u00a0\n137.88 (STEIGER and JAGER, 1977) for both U data reduction and direct calculation of 207Pb-552\u00a0\n206Pb dates from 207Pb*\/206Pb* ratios.  Because 235U is much less abundant than 238U, the 553\u00a0\nmoles of 235U used to calculate the 207Pb\/235U date is commonly determined by dividing the 554\u00a0\nmoles of 238U by the assumed 238U\/235U = 137.88.  This assumption is required when a 235U 555\u00a0\ntracer is employed or when the 238U\/235U ratio cannot be determined with the required 556\u00a0\nprecision.  In contrast, calculation of a 207Pb\/206Pb date is explicitly related to a single 557\u00a0\nassumed present day 238U\/235U ratio and the determined 207Pb*\/206Pb* ratio of a sample.  Thus 558\u00a0\nboth U-Pb and 207Pb-206Pb dates rely in part on the 238U\/235U ratio used or assumed, but in 559\u00a0\ndifferent ways.   560\u00a0\nFigure 5 depicts the bias that an incorrectly assumed 238U\/235U ratio imparts on 207Pb\/235U and 561\u00a0\n207Pb\/206Pb dates.  Each graph considers three test cases where the true 238U\/235U differs from 562\u00a0\na value of 137.88.  The difference (percentage and absolute) between the dates calculated 563\u00a0\nusing the test 238U\/235U values and 137.88 are plotted.  Figure 5A illustrates the relative and 564\u00a0\nabsolute bias of the 207Pb\/235U dates when the moles of 235U were determined by dividing the 565\u00a0\nmeasured moles of 238U by the 238U\/235U of the sample, as is the case when mass 566\u00a0\nspectrometry protocol does not permit precise measurement of the sample 235U concentration 567\u00a0\n(e.g., when a 235U (\u00b1233U) tracer is employed).  The plots show that the percent change in the 568\u00a0\n207Pb\/235U date decreases for older dates, but the absolute magnitude of that change increases 569\u00a0\napproximately logarithmically.  At ca. 4.567 Ga a 0.1% shift in 238U\/235U results in a 0.022% 570\u00a0\ndifference in the 207Pb-235U date.  For Cenozoic dates, that difference increases to 0.1% per 571\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.1% shift in 238U\/235U.  Figures 5B shows that both the percent and absolute change in the 572\u00a0\n207Pb\/206Pb date decrease as a function of date.  Assuming the 238U\/235U is 137.88 when it is 573\u00a0\nactually lower, as indicated by this study and others, biases both the calculated 207Pb\/235U and 574\u00a0\n207Pb\/206Pb dates toward older values, and the change in the 207Pb\/206Pb date is always larger.  575\u00a0\nAlthough the relative change in the 207Pb\/206Pb date increases dramatically for younger dates, 576\u00a0\nthese young dates cannot be precisely resolved using the 207Pb\/206Pb system; the more precise 577\u00a0\n206Pb\/238U date is usually used instead. 578\u00a0\nThe magnitude of these biases has limited impact on most published U-Pb dates given other 579\u00a0\nsources of uncertainty but is significant for efforts to inter-calibrate \u03bb235U and \u03bb238U using 580\u00a0\nvery high-quality, high-precision, data generated specifically for this purpose (see above).  581\u00a0\nGiven the dearth of absolute 238U\/235U determinations on U-bearing accessory minerals such 582\u00a0\na zircon, we believe it prudent at this point to refrain from proposing a 238U\/235U value for use 583\u00a0\nin geochronology until such a dataset exists.  However, this study indicates that the 584\u00a0\nassumption that all uranium in geochronologically relevant minerals has a 238U\/235U =137.88 585\u00a0\nis unlikely.  The question remains, what is the range of 238U\/235U in commonly dated U-586\u00a0\nbearing accessory minerals, and how much variation should be expected (and accounted for 587\u00a0\nin uncertainty estimation)? 588\u00a0\nOf particular interest are the oldest objects in the solar system. No absolute 238U\/235U data 589\u00a0\nhave been reported for any meteorites, their components (e.g., CAIs), or other extraterrestrial 590\u00a0\nmaterials so far.  Brennecka et al (2010) demonstrate that there are variations in 238U\/235U for 591\u00a0\nCAIs within single meteorites, notably the Allende CV3 carbonaceous chondrite, whose CAI 592\u00a0\nU-Pb dates are thought to record some of the earliest materials to condense in the solar 593\u00a0\nsystem (AMELIN et al., 2009; BRENNECKA et al., 2010).  This previously unappreciated 594\u00a0\nvariation in CAI uranium isotope compositions indicates that further inroads in high precision 595\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPb-Pb geochronology will depend upon determining 238U\/235U for each dated CAI.  Based 596\u00a0\nupon the variation in 238U\/235U documented by Brennecka et al (2010) these variations could 597\u00a0\nresult in a \u22645 Myr change for individual CAIs, although the effect on most CAIs will be 598\u00a0\nmuch less, on the order of ~1 Myr (BRENNECKA et al., 2010).  Published 238U\/235U 599\u00a0\ndeterminations on CAIs have been made by MC-ICP-MS using 233U-236U double spikes 600\u00a0\ncalibrated against CRM 145 (AMELIN et al., 2010) and SRM 950a (BRENNECKA et al., 2010) 601\u00a0\nand therefore only provided values relative to the given reference material even though 602\u00a0\nabsolute values are often presented (calculated relative to an assumed 238U\/235U \u2261 137.88 for 603\u00a0\na given reference material).  Absolute 238U\/235U values have now been determined for these 604\u00a0\nreference materials (this study) and therefore provide a means to calculate 238U\/235U values of 605\u00a0\nthe CAIs that are traceable to SI units, from both previous and future analyses.  Such absolute 606\u00a0\nvalues can be used for accurate age determinations where coupled 207Pb-206Pb-238U-235U 607\u00a0\ndatasets have been generated from the exact same material (i.e., AMELIN et al., 2010).\u00a0608\u00a0\n7. CONCLUSIONS 609\u00a0\nWe have determined new 238U\/235U values of several commonly used natural uranium 610\u00a0\nstandards that lacked high precision isotopic compositions.  All of the determinations made in 611\u00a0\nthis study are relative to a certified value of 233U\/236U = 1.01906 \u00b1 0.016% for the IRMM 612\u00a0\n3636 double spike (RICHTER et al., 2008).  We estimate that the uncertainty from our mass 613\u00a0\nspectrometry is <0.01% for the 238U\/235U ratios including inter-laboratory agreement 614\u00a0\nexperiments.  When the certified uncertainty in the IRMM 3636 233U\/236U ratio is considered 615\u00a0\nwe estimate the total uncertainty on the 238U\/235U ratios determined for the various reference 616\u00a0\nmaterials is < 0.02%. 617\u00a0\nThe low (0.016%) uncertainty of the gravimetrically calibrated 233U-236U double spike 618\u00a0\n(IRMM 3636) has permitted re-evaluation of some commonly used synthetic uranium 619\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ninternational reference materials (CRM U500 and IRMM 184) resulting in new values with 620\u00a0\ntotal uncertainties reduced compared to the certified values.  The uncertainty on the 238U\/235U 621\u00a0\nratio of CRM U500 has been reduced by a factor of five, from 0.1% to 0.02%.  This reference 622\u00a0\nmaterial has been used to calibrate double spikes employed in high-accuracy U-Th and U-Pb 623\u00a0\ngeochronology and this reduced uncertainty will impact upon these determinations and 624\u00a0\nestimates of \u03bb235U, \u03bb234U and \u03bb230Th.   625\u00a0\nThe consensus value of 238U\/235U = 137.88 (STEIGER and JAGER, 1977) has been used for the 626\u00a0\npast three decades.   However, improvements in mass spectrometry, combined with the 627\u00a0\ndevelopment of the gravimetric reference IRMM 233U-236U double spike (RICHTER et al., 628\u00a0\n2008) provides us with an opportunity to reassess the consensus value.  All the natural 629\u00a0\nuranium standards analysed in this study have yielded 238U\/235U ratios lower than the widely 630\u00a0\nused \u2018consensus\u2019 value by up to 0.08%.  These results, combined with the results of previous 631\u00a0\nstudies (STIRLING et al., 2007; WEYER et al., 2008), indicate that assuming 238U\/235U is 632\u00a0\ninvariant at the <0.1% level is incorrect and must be considered in all high-precision studies 633\u00a0\nthat rely upon this value.  The new 238U\/235U determinations presented in this study provide 634\u00a0\nvalues for use in tracer calibration and calibration of mass and\/or detector bias during mass 635\u00a0\nspectrometry and provide a reference for studies attempting to quantify absolute 238U\/235U 636\u00a0\nratios for geochronologic determinations. 637\u00a0\n 638\u00a0\nAcknowledgements.

Repeated measurements of the 847\u00a0\n233U\/236U ratio were used to monitor instrumental mass fractionation for each cycle; 848\u00a0\ncycles were then corrected for fractionation and 238U and 235U interferences from the 849\u00a0\ntracer.  The standards SRM 950a and SRM U500 also contain a significant quantity of 850\u00a0\n236U, which must be subtracted from the 236U of the tracer for fractionation correction.  851\u00a0\nThe same set of equations can be used for solutions with and without 236U, neglecting 852\u00a0\n236Ustd terms for the latter.   853\u00a0\nFor this paper, calculations were performed in MATLAB, using its provided

The purpose of this experiment 943\u00a0\nwas neither to determine the absolute accuracy nor ultimate performance of this TIMS 944\u00a0\ninstrument, but rather, to establish the typical level of cup matching and external 945\u00a0\nreproducibility at ion beam intensities typical of the 233U-235U-236U ion beams encountered in 946\u00a0\nthe U measurements and to ensure the instrument exhibited no gross anomalies relative to 947\u00a0\nother multi-collector TIMS instruments. 948\u00a0\nNd was loaded onto outgassed zone-refined Re filaments prepared and tested as for the U 949\u00a0\nmeasurements and analysed as Nd+ ions using a double filament configuration.  Data 950\u00a0\nobtained for ion beams ranging from 0.3-1.0 V 142Nd were used for comparison with the U 951\u00a0\ndata. An identical measurement protocol to U measurements was used for baseline and gain 952\u00a0\nmeasurement, zoom lens use and amplifier rotation.  The data were corrected for mass 953\u00a0\nfractionation using an exponential correction (WASSERBURG et al., 1981), using 146Nd\/144Nd \u2261 954\u00a0\n0.7219, the TIMS mass fractionation normalization value for Nd+ ions was defined on the 955\u00a0\nbasis of an average of many 146Nd\/144Nd determinations (O'NIONS et al., 1977).  We have 956\u00a0\nused the 142Nd\/144Nd and 145Nd\/144Nd ratios for cup matching, partly because there are recent 957\u00a0\nvery high precision TIMS measurements available for comparison from the 142Nd \u2013anomaly 958\u00a0\nliterature (e.g. (CARO et al., 2006; SHARMA and CHEN, 2004).   The experiment results are 959\u00a0\nsummarized in Table 3 and show that all of the data as measured in various Faraday cup pairs 960\u00a0\nagree well within error of the best single-collector peak jumping Nd isotope data (LUGMAIR 961\u00a0\nand CARLSON, 1978; WASSERBURG et al., 1981) which are independent of any inaccuracies 962\u00a0\nrelated to cup efficiencies.  Furthermore, the critical axial \u2013 high 2 Faraday pair agree with 963\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe Caro et al. (CARO et al., 2006) 142Nd\/144Nd data at the ~5 \u00b1 25 ppm level (2 SD), and with 964\u00a0\nthe (SHARMA and CHEN, 2004) data at the ~16 \u00b1 25 ppm level (2 SD) based on 142Nd\/144Nd 965\u00a0\nnormalized for mass fractionation using 146Nd\/144Nd measured on the same cups.  This further 966\u00a0\nsupports our inference that there is little or no significant bias to be expected on the 235U\/238U 967\u00a0\nmeasurements normalized to 233U\/236U arising from differences in the axial \u2013 high 2 Faraday 968\u00a0\ncups.  The Nd measurements also show all other pairs of Faraday cups are matched to levels 969\u00a0\nbetter than ~9 \u00b1 37 ppm.  Based upon these experiments we are confident that our analytical 970\u00a0\nuncertainties, on the order of 0.004 to 0.008% for the corrected 238U\/235U determinations, are 971\u00a0\nan accurate reflection of our ability to measure that ratio at these experimental conditions. 972\u00a0\n973\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTable A2.1.
