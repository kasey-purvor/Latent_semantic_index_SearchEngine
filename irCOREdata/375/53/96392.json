London: Bodley Head, 2009. 256 pp.,\n\u00a316.99 hardcover, 978 1847920379\nIn the wake of the failure of the UN climate negotiations\nin December 2009, hindsight unfairly benefits any review\nof the various manifestos on climate change policy pub-\nlished before the Copenhagen meeting. The three books in\nquestion \u2013 by a renowned sociologist (Giddens) and two\neminent economists (Nordhaus and Stern) \u2013 merit atten-\ntion on the basis of their comprehensive assessments and\naspirations to global policy relevance. All recognise the\ngreat difficulties in securing international agreement on\nstrong climate mitigation and adaptation measures, though\nGiddens\u2019 volume was the most prescient in anticipating the\nlowest common denominator structure of the Copenhagen\nAccord. Significantly, given the continuing attacks on the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), all\nthree authors also accept its scientific account of global\nwarming. In this review, I highlight the key differences in\ntheir prescriptions for policy action to prevent dangerous\nclimate change, which can be characterised as \u2018slow-ramp\u2019 \u2013\ngradually increasing restraints on carbon emissions (Nord-\nhaus) \u2013 and \u2018springboard\u2019 \u2013 immediate deep cuts in emis-\nsions, whether mainly by market mechanisms (Stern) or a\nbroader mix of policy instruments (Giddens).\nArguably the most significant provision in the Copenha-\ngen Accord is the acceptance of the IPCC view that deep\ncuts in greenhouse gas emissions are required to hold the\nprojected increase in global mean temperature to 2\u0002C\n(compared to pre-industrial levels). Warming above 2\ndegrees is taken to be \u2018dangerous anthropogenic inter-\nference with the climate system\u2019, which parties have an\nobligation to prevent under Article 2 of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThere remain uncertainties about how likely such a tem-\nperature increase is in relation to predicted greenhouse gas\nemissions and concentrations, yet the severity of the prob-\nlem is acknowledged by each author. Stern is the clearest\nin pinpointing the dangers: given current concentrations of\ngreenhouse gases at 430 parts per million (ppm) CO2\nequivalent, he cites UK climate models indicating that the\nchances of exceeding 2\u0002C are 78 per cent at 450 ppm and\n96 per cent at 500 ppm. He claims that current emission\nlevels and atmospheric stocks of greenhouse gases render it\nhighly unlikely that concentrations can be kept below 450\nppm, so policy makers must strive to stay within an upper\nlimit of 500 ppm, which would at least provide a strong\nchance of avoiding an even more harmful rise of 3\u0002C\n(Stern, pp. 26\u201327). In other words, and this is not con-\ntradicted by the short summaries on climate science in\nGiddens and Nordhaus, \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change is now\nhighly likely, so the policy challenge is how quick and deep\nour emissions reductions should be to reduce this harm and\nprevent more damaging future rises in temperature.\nIn choosing between possible trajectories for reducing\nemissions, policy makers cannot avoid making judgements\nboth about future returns on capital and also how the\nrelative welfare of future generations is weighted in cur-\nrent decision making. The rate at which we \u2018discount\u2019\nfuture costs and benefits is critical to addressing the cli-\nmate change problem, because there are significant uncer-\ntainties in calculating the welfare impacts of something\naffecting more than one generation. If, as Giddens and\nStern note most forcefully, dangerous climate change\nposes a potentially catastrophic threat to future conditions\nof human life on the planet, then the decision environ-\nment is even more fraught. There is a familiar collective\naction dilemma here, which Giddens labels, seemingly\nwithout irony, \u2018Giddens\u2019s paradox\u2019 (Giddens, p. 2): how\nto craft effective policies in the face of high-consequence\nrisks which fail to register as immediate and tangible\ndangers?\nA clear division between Nordhaus and Stern on the\nissue of discounting largely accounts for their respective\nsupport for the slow-ramp and springboard approaches to\nGlobal Policy Volume 1 .

For Nordhaus the present and future welfare\nof humans is best served by slowly increasing carbon taxes\nin the short term, then ratcheting these up in subsequent\ndecades. It is efficient now, he claims, to direct higher-\nyield investments elsewhere, generating returns that can be\nallocated to more cost-effective climate mitigation technol-\nogies in the future. This approach rests on a social welfare\nfunction, derived from neoclassical economics, which dis-\ncounts future economic goods using an estimated market\nreturn on capital of 4 per cent, which is seen as consistent\nwith current market rates of return (Nordhaus, p. 10). Yet,\nas Stern convincingly argues, it is simply misleading to\ninfer intergenerational values by this method in the climate\nchange context of distorted or absent markets: \u2018there are no\nmarkets which can reveal how a generation, faced with the\nprospect of inflicting massive changes on future genera-\ntions, should behave\u2019 (Stern, p. 87). Significantly, Nordhaus\nconcedes that the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate\nand the Environment (DICE) he employs has limited util-\nity in modelling the potentially abrupt and catastrophic\nconsequences from climate change (Nordhaus, pp. 143\u2013\n147): indeed, to function methodologically, it needs high\ndiscounting of future risks.\nStern is more upfront than Nordhaus (and surprisingly\nalso Giddens) on the ethical issues at stake in policy inter-\nventions to address dangerous climate change. His moral\njustification for springboard actions \u2013 early and decisive\naction to hold CO2 equivalent concentrations below 500\nppm \u2013 starts with the observation that, even within the\n\u2018revealed ethics\u2019 approach of Nordhaus, it is implausible to\nselect a discount rate derived from imperfect capital mar-\nkets rather than, say, the lower interest rates of long-term\nsecurities. It is well known that the Stern Review on cli-\nmate change economics set social discount rates more in\nline with the latter. However, in A Blueprint for a Safer\nPlanet, Stern is more circumspect about the use of social\nwelfare discounting to prescribe policy on climate change.\nHe calls for an explicit treatment of ethical decisions and\nvalues, including an openness to approaches beyond the\nutilitarian constructs of neoclassical economics. While his\nown social democratic position is flagged up, it is made\nclear that it must find political legitimacy in processes of\ninclusive deliberation.\nFor Giddens the threat of dangerous climate change also\njustifies ambitious emissions reductions, in which industria-\nlised countries act first in light of their historical pollution\nrecord, their technical capabilities for climate mitigation\nand their economic capacity to assist developing countries\nadapt to the damaging impacts of climate change. All these\npoints resonate with UNFCCC obligations on parties.\nMore original is his argument that, in order to secure\nenduring public support, springboard policy actions must\nrest on a \u2018radicalism of the centre\u2019 (Giddens, p. 114) that\ndisavows left\u2013right ideological exchanges and also green\npolitical values. In a provocative but insightful chapter, he\nreviews a number of normative concepts with roots in the\ngreen movement \u2013 the precautionary principle, sustainable\ndevelopment, overdevelopment and polluter pays (Giddens,\npp. 49\u201372). Only the last two survive his critical scrutiny,\ntaking their place in a list of concepts that should serve, he\nargues, as the normative basis for a political concordat to\naddress climate change. The concordat is discussed only in\nterms of democratic states (Giddens, pp. 113\u2013117), begging\nthe question of its applicability to other types of political\nsystem.\nOf course, effective measures to address climate change\nrequire the fullest possible international cooperation. Each\nauthor favours the globally harmonised use of market-\nbased mechanisms in climate change policy. In part, this\nreflects the notion that \u2018optimal\u2019 policy responses should\nbe economically efficient \u2013 that marginal abatement costs\nequal the marginal social cost of emissions. In his analy-\nsis Nordhaus clings to this idealised model, which under-\npins his championing of price-based carbon taxes over\nquantity-based cap-and-trade schemes (Nordhaus, pp.\n148\u2013164). He argues that climatic constraints, such as\nconcentration and temperature limits, are irrational from\nan economic perspective: according to the DICE model,\nstaying within the Copenhagen Accord limit of 2\u0002C\nwould require high suboptimal carbon taxes, with a net\nloss in global economic welfare of $1.6 trillion (present\nvalue) by the end of this century compared to a net gain\nin the \u2018optimal\u2019 policy of $3.4 trillion, which involves a\nglobal temperature change of 2.61\u0002C by 2100, and\n3.45\u0002C by 2200 (Nordhaus, pp. 69\u201373, 82\u201383). This\nassumes a global economic future in which the risks of\nhigher climate change outcomes are outweighed by the\nconsumptive gains of a richer world; in other words, that\nwelfare losses caused by (potential) climate change dam-\nage can be compensated from other sources. In a world\nof dangerous climate change, this assumption is highly\nquestionable.\nWhile Giddens and Stern both support springboard\napproaches with market-based steering, the former\nfavours carbon taxation while the latter opts for carbon\ntrading as the key policy instrument, citing the greater\nregulatory certainty of emission caps and the private sec-\ntor flows of finance available for transfer from rich to\npoor countries (Stern, pp. 103\u2013104). However, as both\nGiddens (pp. 197\u2013202) and Nordhaus (pp. 159\u2013161)\ncaution, the record on carbon trading is at best mixed\n(e.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme), with much\nevidence of inefficient rent seeking. Carbon trading must\nbe embedded in smarter governance institutions. Giddens\nis most insightful on the politics of climate change\naction and cooperation; in particular, how action to limit\nglobal warming needs to converge with supporting politi-\ncal and economic goals (e.g. energy security, low-carbon\ngrowth). At the geopolitical level, he highlights the\nrelationships of power that must be accommodated in\nTackling Dangerous Climate Change\n337\nGlobal Policy (2010) 1:3 Copyright \u0003 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\ninternational climate negotiations (Giddens, pp. 203\u2013226).\nThis political realism is a necessary corrective to the\nrational optimism of Stern\u2019s \u2018global deal\u2019 on climate\nchange, including his argument for a world environment\norganisation (Stern, pp. 200\u2013202). Nevertheless, in so far\nas we must fall back on risk-based analysis to identify\ncommon interests and inspire practical action on climate\nchange, then I know of no better starting point than A\nBlueprint for a Safer Planet.\nDr Michael Mason is Senior Lecturer in Environmental\nGeography in the Department of Geography and the Environ-\nment, and Research Associate of the Grantham Research Insti-\ntute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London\nSchool of Economics and Political Science.\nMichael Mason\n338\nCopyright \u0003 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
