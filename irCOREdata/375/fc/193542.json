Morrissey1*\nDepartment of Genetics, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, United Kingdom,1 and\nInstitute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University of Nottingham,\nUniversity Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom2\nReceived 14 June 2005\/Accepted 12 September 2005\nWe have shown that Staphylococcus aureus biofilm production is induced in iron-restricted conditions and is\nrepressed by iron via a Fur-independent mechanism, while Fur has both positive and negative regulatory roles\nin low iron. Furthermore, there is no significant increase in polymeric N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide\nexpression to account for induction of biofilms in low iron.\nStaphylococcus aureus is one of the most frequently isolated\npathogens associated with nosocomial sepsis. Patients particu-\nlarly at risk of developing staphylococcal infections are those\nwith indwelling medical devices, which S. aureus colonizes as a\nbiofilm (11). Several environmental factors have been shown to\ninfluence S. aureus biofilm formation, including anaerobic\ngrowth (5), osmotic stress (15, 20), and glucose availability\n(15). A major environmental stress encountered by bacteria in\nvivo is severe iron restriction; to investigate the role of iron in\nthe regulation of biofilm formation, S. aureus strains Newman\n(7) and 8325-4 (18) and clinical strains CAPD-83, CAPD-84,\nand CAPD-92 (University Hospitals of Leicester) and\nB1003003 and B1703012 (Queen\u2019s Medical Centre, Notting-\nham, United Kingdom) were grown in CRPMI medium in 5%\nCO2 in air (18) for 24 h, diluted to an optical density at 595 nm\n(OD595) of 0.1 in fresh CRPMI with and without the addition\nof 50 \u0002M Fe2(SO4)3, and aliquoted into quadruplicate wells of\n96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates (Nunc). The plates\nwere incubated for 24 h, and biofilm formation was assessed as\ndescribed previously (6). All strains showed enhanced biofilm\nformation under low-iron conditions, whereas addition of iron\nresulted in a significant decrease in biofilm formation (Fig. 1A\nand B). All strains besides Newman produced low levels of\nbiofilm when iron was depleted, although the enhancement of\nbiofilm formation in comparison to that in iron-replete me-\ndium was significant. Slight differences in growth of the differ-\nent strains in CRPMI were observed, but these were not\nsignificant. The effect of iron on biofilm formation is concen-\ntration dependent (Fig. 1B); it occurs in other iron-restricted\nmedia and is not due to changes in pH resulting from addition\nof ferric sulfate to the medium, nor is it due to growth in 5%\nCO2 in air compared to growth in air (data not shown). More-\nover, inhibition of biofilm formation is specific for iron; addi-\ntion of other metal ions such as magnesium, manganese, cop-\nper, and calcium did not consistently affect biofilm formation\nto any significant degree (data not shown). Thus biofilm for-\nmation, an important virulence factor of S. aureus, is induced\nin low-iron growth conditions and repressed by iron.\nPrevious studies have shown that osmotic stress induces S.\naureus biofilm formation and that the alternative transcription\nfactor \u0003B is involved in this induction (20). S. aureus Newman\nand 8325-4, representing extremes of biofilm-forming ability in\nlow-iron CRPMI, and the isogenic Newman \u0004sigB::erm mutant\n(10) were used to investigate the combined effect of low iron\nand osmotic stress on the induction of biofilms and the role of\n\u0003B in these conditions. Strains were grown in iron-restricted\nand iron-replete CRPMI in the presence and absence of 3%\nNaCl for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, low iron and high osmotic\nstress resulted in equally high levels of biofilm formation in\nNewman and 8325-4, which was comparable to the amount of\nbiofilm produced by Newman in low iron and low osmotic\nstress. Interestingly, the presence of iron did not completely\nrepress biofilm formation in high osmotic conditions as it does\nin low osmotic conditions, suggesting that different factors are\ninduced in response to low iron and osmotic stress and that\nsome of these are not repressed by iron. In addition, there were\nno significant differences in the patterns of biofilm formation\nbetween Newman and the Newman \u0004sigB::erm mutant (Fig.\n2A) or between 8325-4, which is \u0003B deficient, and the \u0003B-\npositive isogenic strain SH1000 (13; data not shown), suggest-\ning that \u0003B does not have a significant role in the regulation of\nbiofilm formation in low-iron conditions.\nThe polymeric N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide (PNAG)\n(16) encoded by the ica locus is proposed to be critical for\nbiofilm formation (4). To determine the effect of low iron and\nosmotic stress on PNAG production, PNAG levels in cell ex-\ntracts and culture supernatants were measured directly using a\npolysaccharide slot blot assay (1) with polyclonal rabbit anti-\nserum specific for PNAG (16). Surprisingly, there was no re-\nproducible significant increase in the level of PNAG extracted\nfrom strain Newman grown in low-iron conditions compared to\ncells grown in iron-replete conditions (as measured by densi-\ntometry of repeat blots from individual experiments) to ac-\ncount for the significant difference between Newman biofilm\nformation in iron-restricted and iron-replete growth conditions\n* Corresponding author.

Furthermore, 8325-4 produced a level of PNAG\nsimilar to that produced by Newman, and yet 8325-4, in con-\ntrast to Newman, produces only a very low level of biofilm in\nCRPMI (Fig. 2B), and there was no significant increase in\nPNAG levels in either strain to account for the observed in-\ncrease in biofilm under osmotic stress conditions. Additionally,\nalthough some PNAG was detected in the supernatants, there\nwas again no difference in the relative levels compared to the\ncell surface extracts that would account for the differences in\nbiofilm levels (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that\nbiofilm factors other than PNAG are induced in response to\nlow iron and osmotic stress in vitro. These are relevant envi-\nronmental conditions in vivo, and therefore this observation\nmay explain why a number of studies have shown that ica\nmutants are not attenuated in experimental device-related in-\nfection models (8, 9, 14). Therefore, factors other than PNAG\nmay be critical for biofilm formation in vivo.\nIron-responsive gene regulation in S. aureus is mediated by\nthe global regulator Fur (12, 21). To determine the role of Fur\nin iron regulation of biofilm formation, S. aureus Newman and\nthe isogenic Newman \u0004fur::tet mutant, constructed by trans-\nducing the fur::tet mutation from 8325-4 (12) with phage \u000511\n(3), were assayed for biofilm formation in iron-restricted and\niron-replete CRPMI. If Fur were involved in iron-dependent\nrepression of biofilm production, we would expect to see equal\nlevels of biofilm regardless of iron status. However, biofilm\nlevels were still significantly repressed in the presence of iron\nin the Newman fur mutant (P \u0006 0.046), suggesting that Fur is\nnot responsible for the negative iron regulation of S. aureus\nbiofilm formation (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, Fur does appear to\nFIG. 1. S. aureus biofilm formation is regulated by iron. S. aureus strains 8325-4, B1003003, B1703012, CAPD-84, CAPD-83, and CAPD-92\n(A) and Newman (B) were grown in CRPMI overnight, diluted to an OD595 of 0.1 in CRPMI supplemented with Fe2(SO4)3 either at 50 \u0002M (A) or\nat the concentrations indicated (B), and inoculated into quadruplicate wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate. After 24 h, the wells were washed\nwith phosphate-buffered saline, adherent bacteria were stained with 1% (wt\/vol) safranin, and biofilm formation was assessed by OD490 measure-\nments. Results represent the averages of at least three independent experiments and the standard error of the mean.\n8212 NOTES J.

This\nobserved decrease was not due to any significant difference in\ngrowth between the wild-type and fur mutant strains (data not\nshown). PNAG levels of the S. aureus Newman \u0004fur::tet mutant\nwere also measured, but no significant difference was observed\nin any of the growth conditions or in comparison to the wild\ntype, indicating that Fur does not regulate expression of\nPNAG (Fig. 3B).\nThe observation that Fur does not repress S. aureus biofilm\nformation was surprising, as our previous studies indicated that\nFur may have a negative regulatory role in initial adhesion\n(19). Therefore, we investigated the effect of Fur and iron on\nthe earlier stages of S. aureus biofilm formation. At 6 h, as at\n24 h, biofilm formation by wild-type S. aureus Newman showed\nFur-independent negative regulation by iron (Fig. 3C). In con-\ntrast to positive regulation by Fur at the later stages, however,\nit appears that Fur negatively regulates the early stages of S.\naureus biofilm formation in low-iron conditions, as there is a\nsignificant increase in biofilm formation at 6 h in the fur mutant\n(P \u0006 0.008) (Fig. 3C). There were no significant differences in\nthe growth of the wild-type and mutant strains at 6 h. Thus, Fur\nboth positively and negatively regulates different stages of bio-\nfilm formation in low iron. To our knowledge, there have been\nno reports of Fur acting as an activator protein in low iron in\nany other bacteria. The mechanisms of regulation in S. aureus\nare unknown: Fur may act indirectly on another regulatory\nmechanism such as a small RNA (17), or it may repress gene\nFIG. 2. Biofilm assays and slot blot analysis of PNAG extracts indicate that PNAG levels do not correspond with maximal biofilm levels in S.\naureus. (A) Biofilm formation by S. aureus Newman, 8325-4, and the Newman \u0004sigB::erm mutant. (B) PNAG production by strains Newman and\n8325-4. Bacteria were grown in CRPMI overnight and diluted to an OD595 of 0.1 in CRPMI (Fe\u0007) or CRPMI plus 50 \u0002M Fe2(SO4)3 (Fe\u0001) with\n(NaCl\u0001) or without the addition of 3% (vol\/vol) NaCl and inoculated in quadruplicate into wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate. After 24 h the\nwells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, adherent bacteria were stained with safranin, and biofilm formation was assessed by OD490\nmeasurements. Results represent the averages of at least eight independent experiments and the standard error of the mean. For measurement\nof PNAG production, cells were harvested by centrifugation from 24-h static cultures. PNAG was extracted by boiling cell suspensions in EDTA;\ncell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 50-\u0002l samples of serial dilutions (1:10 and 1:100) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane for\nprobing with PNAG-specific rabbit antiserum. Each experiment was repeated at least three times using PNAG extracts obtained from cultures\ngrown on different days with similar results in each case.\nVOL. 187, 2005 NOTES 8213\n o\nn\n August 19, 2013 by University of Leicester\nhttp:\/\/jb.asm.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nexpression by directly binding promoters in low iron as ob-\nserved in Helicobacter pylori (2).\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that iron-mediated re-\npression of biofilm production is Fur independent and that Fur\nhas both positive and negative regulatory roles in low iron. We\nhave also demonstrated that factors other than PNAG are\ncritical for biofilms induced in low-iron growth conditions;\nthere is significant strain variation in the expression of these\nfactors, suggesting that regulation of S. aureus biofilm forma-\ntion is extremely complex.\nFIG. 3. Effect of fur mutation on S. aureus biofilm formation. Strain Newman and the isogenic Newman \u0004fur::tet mutant were grown in CRPMI\novernight, diluted to an OD595 of 0.1 in CRPMI (Fe\u0007) or CRPMI plus 50 \u0002M Fe2(SO4)3 (Fe\u0001), and inoculated in quadruplicate into wells of a\npolystyrene microtiter plate. After (C) 6 h or (A) 24 h, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, adherent bacteria were stained with\nsafranin, and OD490 measurements were obtained. Results represent the averages of at least eight independent experiments and the standard error of\nthe mean. For measurement of PNAG production (B), cells were harvested by centrifugation from 24-h static cultures. Fifty-microliter samples of serial\ndilutions of PNAG extracts (1:10 and 1:100) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane for probing with PNAG-specific rabbit antiserum. Each experiment\nwas repeated at least three times using PNAG extracts obtained from cultures grown on different days with similar results in each case.\n8214 NOTES J.
