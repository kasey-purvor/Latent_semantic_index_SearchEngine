[1993a], for details 40 \nof the phase relationship between changes in methane and climate in Greenland.  This study focuses 41 \non the increase in methane from around 360 ppbv at the last glacial maximum (LGM; ~20ka before 42 \npresent) to approximately 700 ppbv in the pre-industrial era (PI; ~200a before present).  43 \nFundamentally, the increase must have resulted from a change in methane sources, such as 44 \nemissions from wetlands\u2015the largest natural source of methane, and\/or a change in methane sinks, 45 \nthe dominant one being oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH), but the balance between these 46 \nchanges remains uncertain.  Our aim is to identify any atmospheric chemical signals that could be 47 \nused to differentiate between changes in methane emissions and changes in OH, and assess the 48 \nlikelihood they are preserved in Antarctic ice. 49 \n 50 \nEstimates of the changes in methane emissions between the LGM and the PI vary, with much of the 51 \ndiscussion focusing on the change in emissions from wetlands.  Based on a reconstruction of 52 \nvegetation, Chappellaz et al. [1993b] estimated that wetland emissions increased by 80% between 53 \nthe LGM and the PI, underpinning a 46% increase in total methane emissions that could explain 54 \naround half the 94% increase in methane concentration (from 360 to 700 ppbv).  Bottom-up studies 55 \nemploying dynamic global vegetation models, on the other hand, have calculated much smaller 56 \nincreases in wetland emissions, ranging from effectively no change [Kaplan et al., 2006] to an 57 \nincrease of 36% [Valdes et al., 2005], and consequently more modest increases in total methane 58 \nemissions, of 19% and 31% respectively.  Recent calculations by Weber et al. [2010], based on 59 \nclimate simulations from the second phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project 60 \n(PMIP2) [Braconnot et al., 2007], suggest wetland emissions increased by between 54 and 72%, 61 \n4 \n \nand highlight the uncertainty that remains in the size of the source-driven component of the LGM-62 \nPI change in methane concentration. 63 \n 64 \nThe estimated changes in methane emissions cited above suggest changes in methane sources alone 65 \ncannot fully account for the LGM-PI change in methane, and a significant fraction of this must have 66 \nbeen sink-driven (i.e. the result of an increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane).  Valdes et al. 67 \n[2005] and Kaplan et al. [2006] showed how the concentration of OH could have decreased, and 68 \nhence the lifetime of methane increased, as a result of an increase in the amount of non-methane 69 \nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) emitted from vegetation.  An increase in NMVOC 70 \nemissions between the LGM and the PI is consistent with vegetation reconstructions [see, e.g., 71 \nAdams et al., 2001] and model studies of the influence that rising temperatures have on vegetation 72 \n[e.g. Lathi\u00e8re et al., 2005].  However, the size of this increase remains uncertain [see, e.g., Arneth et 73 \nal., 2007], since some laboratory studies have identified a reduction in NMVOC emissions as the 74 \nconcentration of CO2 to which vegetation is exposed is increased [e.g. Wilkinson et al., 2009], and 75 \nthe concentration of CO2 rose between the LGM and the PI [Monnin et al., 2001].  The possible 76 \n\u2018recycling\u2019 of OH consumed in isoprene oxidation [Lelieveld et al., 2008] adds to the uncertainty in 77 \nthe influence NMVOC emissions had on OH and, hence, the size of the sink-driven component of 78 \nthe change in methane concentration. 79 \n 80 \nChanges in the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) emitted from climate-sensitive sources, 81 \nsuch as soils, lightning and biomass burning, could have also affected the lifetime of methane with 82 \nrespect to OH.  All else being equal, we would expect an increase (decrease) in NOx emissions to 83 \nhave led to an increase (decrease) in the concentration of ozone (O3), and hence an increase 84 \n(decrease) in the concentration of OH, since OH is formed from the reaction between excited O(1D) 85 \noxygen atoms (derived from O3) and water vapor.  Valdes et al. [2005] estimated that NOx 86 \nemissions from lightning increased from 3.4 to 4.2 Tg N year-1, whilst those from soils decreased 87 \n5 \n \nfrom 5.7 to 5.1 Tg N year-1, leading to an overall 6% reduction in the lifetime of methane in the PI, 88 \nrelative to the LGM.  However, their estimates of the lightning and soil source strengths are subject 89 \nto large uncertainties; the emissions from lightning, to which the lifetime of methane is especially 90 \nsensitive, are uncertain in the present, never mind the past [Wild, 2007].  It is also unclear how NOx 91 \nemissions from biomass burning changed during this period.  Calculations by Thonicke et al. [2005] 92 \nusing a dynamic global vegetation model with an embedded fire module suggested these could have 93 \ndecreased in the tropics, and thus contributed to an increase in the lifetime of methane.  However, 94 \nbased on a suite of Monte-Carlo calculations, Fischer et al. [2008] concluded that the amount of 95 \nbiomass burning was roughly constant between the LGM and the PI, and a global synthesis of 96 \ncharcoal records by Power et al. [2008] identified the last glacial period (16-21ka before present) as 97 \nthe period of least biomass burning in the last 21kyr, and hence an increase in biomass-burning 98 \nemissions from the LGM to the PI. 99 \n 100 \nThe change in climate itself would have also affected the lifetime of methane.  Contrary to the 101 \nincrease that could help to explain the observed increase in methane concentration, the increase in 102 \ntemperatures, and hence humidities, would have tended to reduce the lifetime of methane by 103 \nincreasing the (temperature-dependent) rate of reaction between OH and methane, and increasing 104 \nthe concentration of OH.  Martinerie et al. [1995] estimated that the increase in humidity would 105 \nhave led to a 6% reduction in the lifetime of methane, whilst Valdes et al. [2005] estimated that this, 106 \ntogether with the increased rate of reaction between OH and methane, would have led to a reduction 107 \nof 14%.  These estimates, however, are subject to significant uncertainties in the changes in 108 \ntemperature between the LGM and the PI [e.g. Braconnot et al., 2007], particularly in the tropics 109 \nwhere roughly three quarters of methane oxidation occurs [see, e.g., Lawrence et al., 2001; 110 \nLabrador et al., 2004].  Proxy data collated and analysed within the Multiproxy Approach for the 111 \nReconstruction of the Glacial Ocean Surface Project [MARGO Project Members, 2009] show an 112 \naverage sea-surface-temperature warming between 15\u00b0N and 15\u00b0S of 1.7(\u00b11.0)\u00b0C between the 113 \n6 \n \nLGM and the PI, and the large, relative uncertainty in this figure (almost 60%) is echoed in the wide 114 \nrange of warmings exhibited by state-of-the-art climate models, from 1.0 to 2.4\u00b0C [Otto-Bliesner et 115 \nal., 2009].  What is not in question, is that the warming climate would have tended to reduce the 116 \nlifetime of methane.  The most likely explanation identified in the literature for a net increase in 117 \nmethane lifetime from the LGM to the PI, which would help to explain the increase in methane 118 \nconcentration, depends upon an increase in NMVOC emissions (discussed above). 119 \n 120 \nPrevious observational studies suggesting the concentration of OH has changed in the past have 121 \nlargely taken a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach, attributing changes in the concentration, or isotopic 122 \ncomposition, of atmospheric constituents trapped or dissolved in polar ice to changes in oxidizing 123 \ncapacity.  A variety of chemical signals with which to identify changes in OH have thus been 124 \nproposed, including: the concentration of formaldehyde [Staffelbach et al., 1991]; the 125 \nconcentrations of hydrogen peroxide and methyl-peroxide [Gillet et al. 2000]; and the mass-126 \nindependent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in sulfates [Savarino et al., 2003].  Studies taking a 127 \ntop-down approach implicitly assume the concentration, or isotopic composition, of a constituent 128 \ntrapped or dissolved in the ice bears some relation to the concentration, or isotopic composition, of 129 \nthat constituent in the boundary layer during the period in which gases could freely exchange 130 \nbetween the atmosphere and the then un-compacted snow, or \u2018firn\u2019.  In the case of methane, its 131 \nconcentration in air trapped in the ice is almost identical to its concentration in the atmosphere.  132 \nHowever, the relationship can be considerably more complicated, as is the case for formaldehyde, 133 \nthe concentration of which in ice is modified during and post-deposition [Hutterli et al., 1999, 134 \n2002]. 135 \n 136 \nIn contrast to previous studies, we take a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, using the Cambridge parallelised-137 \nTropospheric Offline Model of Chemistry and Transport (p-TOMCAT), which is described in 138 \nSection 2.1, to explore changes in the chemical composition of the Antarctic boundary layer 139 \n7 \n \naccompanying source- and sink-driven changes in methane.  We carry out six experiments: a PI 140 \nmodel run, which is described in Section 2.2, and five sensitivity experiments derived from this, 141 \nwhich are described in Section 2.3.  Note that we are not trying to simulate the LGM-PI change in 142 \nmethane.  Instead, these are highly idealized experiments, exploring extreme scenarios, in an effort 143 \nto identify any chemical signal (a chemical species, or combination of species, amongst those 144 \nincluded in p-TOMCAT) that shows potential to constrain the cause(s) of this change.  We examine 145 \nthe results of these experiments in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.  In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we briefly assess 146 \nthe sensitivity of our results to inter-annual variations in meteorology and the definition of the 147 \nAntarctic boundary layer, respectively, before discussing in Section 4 the preservation in Antarctic 148 \nice of those signals which show some potential, and issues surrounding their interpretation.149 \n8 \n \n2 Method 150 \n 151 \n2.1 The Cambridge p-TOMCAT model 152 \n 153 \nFor the purposes of this study, we use the Cambridge p-TOMCAT model of tropospheric chemistry 154 \nand transport, which has been used in a variety of recent studies [K\u00f6hler et al., 2008; Yang et al., 155 \n2008; Cook et al., 2007; and Levine et al., 2007].  This is a three-dimensional Eulerian model 156 \ndriven by wind, temperature and humidity fields taken from the operational analyses of the 157 \nEuropean Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).  Here, the model is run at a 158 \nhorizontal resolution of approximately 2.8\u00b0 x 2.8\u00b0 on 31 levels, which stretch from the surface to 10 159 \nhPa with a typical spacing of about 100m in the boundary layer and 1-1.5km in the vicinity of the 160 \ntropopause.  Tracer advection is calculated with the second-order moments advection scheme of 161 \nPrather [1986], as implemented by Chipperfield [1996].  Transport in the horizontal is driven 162 \ndirectly by the ECMWF winds whilst vertical transport is calculated based on the 163 \nconvergence\/divergence of winds in the horizontal.  Strong convergence also triggers convection, 164 \nwhich is simulated using the mass flux parameterization of Tiedtke [1989].  The model also 165 \ncontains a non-local vertical diffusion scheme for the boundary layer based on the parameterization 166 \nof Holtslag and Boville [1993]; see Wang et al. [1999] for details of its implementation. 167 \n 168 \nThe model chemistry includes 52 chemical species and 174 reactions, which describe the gas-phase 169 \nHOx\/NOx chemistries of methane, ethane, propane and isoprene, the latter according to the Mainz 170 \nIsoprene Mechanism [P\u00f6schl et al., 2000]; the model also includes a simple ethene-like tracer, 171 \nwhich is simply emitted, and removed by OH.  The chemistry scheme is of medium complexity, 172 \ncomparable with the schemes employed in other tropospheric chemistry-transport models, such as 173 \nthe troposphere-only version of the UK Chemistry Aerosol Community Model currently under 174 \ndevelopment (see http:\/\/www.ukca.ac.uk), and is suitable for global integrations spanning years to 175 \n9 \n \ndecades.  The bimolecular and termolecular reaction-rate coefficients (last updated in March 2005) 176 \nare taken from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry [Atkinson et al., 2005] and 177 \nthe Master Chemical Mechanism (see http:\/\/mcm.leeds.ac.uk\/MCM\/home.htt), whilst the photolysis 178 \nrates are calculated offline using the Cambridge 2D model [Law and Pyle, 1993], which is also used 179 \nto provide top-boundary conditions for ozone and NOy.  The concentrations of species are 180 \nintegrated forward in time using the ASAD code of Carver et al. [1997] and the IMPACT time 181 \nintegrator of Carver and Stott [2000].  The wet deposition of soluble species is linked to the 182 \nparameterization of convection (and large-scale rainfall) according to Walton et al. [1988].  The dry 183 \ndeposition of species at the surface is calculated using prescribed 1m deposition velocities 184 \n[Valentin, 1990], extrapolated to the centre of each grid box in the lowest level of the model 185 \naccording to Berntsen and Isaksen [1997].  For more details on the implementation and validation 186 \nof the wet- and dry deposition schemes, see Giannakopoulos et al. [1999]. 187 \n 188 \nThe model does not include halogen chemistry (including the oxidation of methane initiated by 189 \natomic chlorine), snow photochemistry or the loss of methane to soils.  Platt et al. [2004] estimate 190 \nthat atomic chlorine is responsible for about 3% of global methane loss.  We would not expect the 191 \ninclusion of an additional sink of this size to alter our findings significantly, particularly those of a 192 \nqualitative nature.  Snow photochemistry will affect OH in the boundary layer in snow-covered 193 \nregions [see, e.g., Grannas et al., 2007].  We would have to include this if our aim was to reproduce 194 \nabsolute OH concentrations measured in such regions, but it should not have much effect on the 195 \nglobal oxidizing capacity.  Lastly, the loss of methane to soils is omitted on the basis that it 196 \naccounts for only 5-10% of global methane loss, which is small compared to the uncertainty in the 197 \nPI emissions of methane implemented in the model [Valdes et al., 2005]; see next section. 198 \n 199 \n 200 \n2.2 The PI model run 201 \n10 \n \n 202 \nFor the purposes of this experiment, we have implemented as far as practically possible the same PI 203 \nemissions in the Cambridge p-TOMCAT model as Valdes et al. [2005] used in the STOCHEM 204 \natmospheric chemistry-transport model.  The emissions, summarized in Table 1, include: seasonally 205 \nvarying emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane 206 \n(C2H6), propane (C3H8), acetone (CH3COCH3), isoprene (C5H8) and ethene (C2H4), in addition to 207 \nconstant emissions of formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO).  Note that, unlike 208 \nValdes et al. [2005], we do not include emissions of butane, propene, methanol or \uf061-pinene, owing 209 \nto the lack of these species in p-TOMCAT; hydrogen is not emitted but is included in the model as 210 \na constant field.  Lightning emissions of NO2 in p-TOMCAT are coupled in time and space to the 211 \nparameterization of convection [Stockwell et al., 1999], and are therefore unlikely to be distributed 212 \nin the same way, either spatially or temporally, as the lightning emissions of NO in STOCHEM.  213 \nWe note, however, that the total amount of NOx emitted from lightning in p-TOMCAT (normalized 214 \nto 4.8 Tg N\/year) is not dissimilar to that in STOCHEM (4.2 Tg N\/year) [Valdes et al., 2005].   215 \n 216 \nFigure 1 illustrates the distributions of these emissions (excluding lightning emissions of NOx), 217 \nintegrated over a year.  The emissions of methane are dominated by emissions from wetlands in 218 \nequatorial South America and Indonesia, and to a lesser extent, Central Africa and South East Asia.  219 \nThe relatively small amounts of methane coming from the oceans, biomass burning and termites 220 \n(see Table 1) account for its near-ubiquitous, low-level emissions elsewhere around the globe.  The 221 \nemissions of isoprene, which exert a strong influence on OH as a result of isoprene\u2019s short lifetime 222 \nwith respect to oxidation [Atkinson et al., 2005], are concentrated in equatorial regions, but also 223 \nappreciable in the sub-tropics of both hemispheres.  The remaining emissions categorized under 224 \n\u2018vegetation\u2019 in Table 1 are all distributed in the same way as each other, mostly in the tropics and 225 \nsub-tropics but with a significant contribution from mid-latitudes, particularly in the northern 226 \n11 \n \nhemisphere.  This distribution closely resembles the distribution of acetone emissions, the latter 227 \nbeing overwhelmingly dominated by emissions from vegetation (see Table 1). 228 \n 229 \nThe PI model run (and each sensitivity experiment) follows a certain format.  The model is first run 230 \nto equilibrium using repeated meteorology from a single year (1997).  At \u2018equilibrium\u2019, neither the 231 \nglobal burden of methane nor the annual-mean concentration of methane in the Antarctic boundary 232 \nlayer (AntBL; defined to comprise all boxes in the lowest level of the model south of 70\u00b0S) changes 233 \nby more than 0.02% per year.  The model is then run with meteorology from three further years 234 \n(1998-2000) to explore inter-annual variability.  These three years were chosen on the basis that 235 \nthey include contrasting phases of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major contributor to 236 \ninter-annual variations in the distributions of trace gases within the troposphere [e.g. Chandra et al., 237 \n1998; Ziemke and Chandra, 2003]; the northern hemisphere winters of 1997\/1998 and 1998\/1999 238 \nwere El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a respectively, whilst 2000 was less affected by the ENSO.   The data 239 \ngathered in these three years are then used to characterize the chemical composition of the AntBL.  240 \nNote, we assume recent meteorological analyses adequately represent the meteorology of the PI. 241 \n 242 \n 243 \n2.3 The sensitivity experiments 244 \n 245 \nWe carry out five sensitivity experiments, each starting from the PI model setup; these are 246 \nschematically illustrated in Figure 2.  The first two experiments, Sink 1 and Source 1, are designed 247 \nto identify any chemical signal that responds in a substantially different manner to purely source-248 \ndriven and purely sink-driven changes in methane (of the same size), making no assumptions about 249 \nthe cause(s) of the latter.  In Source 1, we reduce the concentration of methane in the AntBL to 250 \nroughly that which was present at the LGM by scaling down the emissions of methane (uniformly) 251 \nby 45%.  In Sink 1, we increase the production of OH by a factor of 2.5 to effect the same change in 252 \n12 \n \nmethane concentration.  We do so by increasing the number of OH radicals produced as each 253 \nexcited oxygen atom, O(1D), reacts with a water molecule.  This is simply a way of increasing the 254 \nconcentration of OH without making any assumptions about the cause of this increase, which would 255 \nhave chemical consequences.  For example, if we were to instead increase the rate of this reaction, 256 \nwe would not only increase the rate of OH formation, but also the rate of O(1D) removal.  The third 257 \nand fourth experiments, Sink 2 and Source 2, are designed to assess whether there exists a signal 258 \ncapable of differentiating between source- and sink-driven changes in methane, when the latter are 259 \nthe result of changes in the amount of NMVOCs emitted from vegetation.  In Sink 2, all emissions 260 \nfrom vegetation (i.e. those categorized under \u2018vegetation\u2019 in Table 1) are switched off, leading to a 261 \nsubstantial reduction in methane, but a smaller one than in Sink 1 or Source 1.  The same reduction 262 \nin methane is achieved in Source 2, as in Sink 2, by scaling down the emissions of methane by 263 \n17%.  In the fifth experiment, Sink+Source, we remove all emissions from vegetation (as in Sink 2) 264 \nand scale down the emissions of methane by 31% to reduce the concentration of methane to that 265 \nwhich was present at the LGM (as in Sink 1 and Source 1).  By comparing the results to this 266 \nexperiment with those to Source 1, we can assess a signal\u2019s ability to differentiate between a purely 267 \nsource-driven change in methane, and one which is part source-driven, part sink-driven. 268 \n 269 \nThough we explore in Sink 1 the consequences of a change in OH generated in such as way as to 270 \nmake no assumptions about the cause(s) of this change, we do not explore changes in OH driven 271 \nexplicitly by changes in NOx emissions or climate, which would have influences on the atmospheric 272 \ncomposition besides their effects on OH, and presumably different ones to the changes in NMVOC 273 \nemissions that we explore in Sink 2 and Sink+Source.  As outlined in Section 1, there are 274 \nsignificant uncertainties associated with the changes in NOx emissions and climate between the 275 \nLGM and the PI, and their influences on the oxidizing capacity were probably subsidiary to the 276 \ninfluence of changes in NMVOC emissions.  Our approach is therefore to first try to find a signal 277 \ncapable of differentiating between source- and sink-driven changes in methane, subject to constant 278 \n13 \n \nNOx emissions and climate, and only if we find such a signal (and believe it will be preserved in the 279 \nice record on the necessary timescales), explore whether it would prove robust to such changes.280 \n14 \n \n3 Results 281 \n 282 \n3.1 Methane in the Antarctic (and Arctic) boundary layer 283 \n 284 \nFigure 3 illustrates the concentrations of methane in the AntBL and the Arctic boundary layer 285 \n(ArcBL; defined to comprise all boxes in the lowest level of the model north of 70\u00b0N) that we 286 \ncalculate in the PI model run (top panel) and the five sensitivity experiments: Sink 1, Source 1 and 287 \nSink+Source (bottom panel); Sink 2 and Source 2 (middle panel).  In each case, the data correspond 288 \nto the last three years of the model\u2019s run to equilibrium, using repeated 1997 meteorology, and the 289 \nsubsequent three years employing meteorology from 1998-2000. 290 \n 291 \nThe PI model run (top panel) yields methane concentrations of 705-720 ppbv in the AntBL and 292 \n740-755 ppbv in the ArcBL, amounting to annual-mean concentrations, averaged over 1998-2000, 293 \nof 709 ppbv and 744 ppbv respectively.  (From here on, all annual-mean concentrations refer to 294 \naverages over 1998-2000.)  There is thus an average inter-hemispheric gradient of 35 ppbv, which 295 \narises as a result of a bias in the distribution of methane sources towards the northern hemisphere.  296 \nThis compares well with the average inter-hemispheric gradient of 35 (+\/-7) ppbv evident from 297 \nhigh-resolution measurements between 0.25 and 1ka before present [Chappellaz et al., 1997].  In 298 \nboth the AntBL and the ArcBL, the concentration of methane exhibits an annual cycle, between a 299 \nmaximum in local spring and a minimum in local autumn, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of roughly 300 \n10 ppbv.  This cycle reflects seasonal variations in the strength of methane emissions.  Note that 301 \nalmost identical cycles are calculated in the last three years of the run to equilibrium (3 x 1997), 302 \nconfirming the model had indeed reached equilibrium before it was run with 1998-2000 303 \nmeteorology.  In the latter three years, the concentrations of methane show some inter-annual 304 \nvariability but no obvious trend; we note that the influence of inter-annual variations in meteorology 305 \non the concentration of methane has previously been explored by Warwick et al. [2002]. 306 \n15 \n \n 307 \nThe annual-mean concentration of methane in the AntBL is reduced to around 340 ppbv in Sink 1, 308 \nSource 1 and Sink+Source (bottom panel).  Recall, the aim in these experiments was to reduce the 309 \nconcentration of methane in this region to roughly that which characterized the LGM (~360 ppbv).  310 \nHowever, the concentration of methane in the ArcBL is reduced to different extents in these 311 \nexperiments: to 375 ppbv in Sink 1 and around 360 ppbv in Source 1 and Sink+Source.  It follows 312 \nthat, relative to the PI, the inter-hemispheric gradient remains unchanged in Sink 1 but is reduced in 313 \nSource 1 and Sink+Source to around 20 ppbv\u2014a reduction of 43%.  It would therefore appear that, 314 \nin Source 1, the inter-hemispheric gradient scales linearly with the amount of methane emitted, the 315 \nlatter being reduced by 45% relative to the PI.  However, this scaling results from the way in which 316 \nthe emissions are reduced; by scaling the emissions uniformly, we do not change their geographical 317 \ndistribution.  In reality, the reduction in methane emissions occurred mostly in the northern mid- 318 \nand high latitudes [e.g. Chappellaz et al., 1993b; Kaplan, 2002], and measurements at the LGM 319 \n(16.7-20.3ka before present) reveal an inter-hemispheric gradient of only a few ppbv [D\u00e4llenbach et 320 \nal., 2000]. 321 \n 322 \nIn Sink 2 (middle panel), switching off all emissions from vegetation reduces the annual-mean 323 \nconcentration of methane in the AntBL to 554 ppbv.  This reduction equates to just less than half 324 \nthe change in methane observed between the LGM (~360 ppbv) and the PI (~700 ppbv).  A similar 325 \nreduction in AntBL methane is achieved in Source 2 (middle panel) by reducing the emissions of 326 \nmethane by 17%.  Meanwhile, the concentration of methane in the ArcBL is reduced to 585 ppbv in 327 \nSink 2 and 581 ppbv in Source 2, giving inter-hemispheric gradients of 31 ppbv and 29 ppbv 328 \nrespectively.  As before, in Source 2, the gradient in methane scales linearly with the amount of 329 \nmethane emitted because the emissions of methane are scaled uniformly. 330 \n 331 \n 332 \n16 \n \n3.2 Chemical sensitivities in the AntBL 333 \n 334 \nTable 2 gives the annual-mean concentration of each chemical species in the AntBL, calculated in 335 \nthe PI model run, and the percentage change in this, calculated in each sensitivity experiment.  336 \nStrictly, the annual-mean PI concentration ([X]PI) is the mean of three annual-mean concentrations 337 \ncorresponding to the three years of meteorology (1998-2000) with which the model is driven.  338 \nLikewise, each percentage change in concentration (e.g. \uf044[X]Sink1-PI) is the mean of three percentage 339 \nchanges in annual-mean concentration (relative to the PI), each subject to a different year\u2019s 340 \nmeteorology.  The corresponding standard deviations are also given in Table 2.  The species in 341 \nTable 2 are listed in order of the difference between the percentage changes in concentration, or 342 \n\u2018sensitivities\u2019, they exhibit in Sink 1 and Source 1 (i.e. |\uf044[X]Sink1-PI - \uf044[X]Source1-PI|). 343 \n 344 \nIn the AntBL, OH shows the greatest difference in sensitivity between the first pair of sensitivity 345 \nexperiments, increasing by 112% in Sink 1 and 19% in Source 1 (relative to the PI); the global 346 \ntropospheric burden of OH increases by 84% in Sink 1 and 12% in Source 1.  However, owing to its 347 \nhigh reactivity as a radical species, OH will not be preserved in the ice record; hence the need for 348 \nthis study.  We can similarly discount all other radical species (not shown in Table 2), and those 349 \nspecies which are rapidly broken down into radicals (HONO and N2O5), from our list of potential 350 \nchemical signals.  Note that increasing the concentration of OH in Sink 1, by increasing the 351 \nproduction of OH, reduces the concentration of methane, whilst reducing the concentration of 352 \nmethane in Source 1 and Source 2, by reducing the amount of methane emitted, increases the 353 \nconcentration of OH\u2015in the AntBL, by 19% and 7% respectively; the global tropospheric burden 354 \nof OH increases by 12% and 5%.  OH and methane thus exhibit an inter-dependence that limits the 355 \nextent to which we can separately explore the effects of changes in OH\/methane emissions.  This 356 \ninter-dependence also constitutes a small positive feedback that reinforces any change we make to 357 \nOH or methane [Prather, 1996], evidenced by the slightly greater-than-linear reductions in AntBL 358 \n17 \n \nmethane in Source 1 and Source 2, of 52% and 22% respectively, in response to 45% and 17% 359 \nreductions in methane emissions.  (Here, the feedback comprises a reduction in methane lifetime 360 \ndue to an increase in OH, as seen in previous theoretical studies [e.g. Isaksen and Hov, 1987].) 361 \n 362 \nIsoprene (C5H8) and a number of its degradation products (ISON, NALD, MACR, ISOOH, MPAN 363 \nand HACET) show substantially different sensitivities in Sink 1 and Source 1, decreasing by 50-364 \n70% and 10-20% respectively.  The \u2018lumped species\u2019 (indicated by parentheses in Table 2), used to 365 \ndescribe the oxidation of isoprene in the Mainz Isoprene Mechanism [P\u00f6schl et al., 2000], could in 366 \nprinciple provide useful chemical signals, so long as all their (major) constituents are preserved in 367 \nthe ice.  However, owing to the negligible concentrations these species exhibit in the PI AntBL, 368 \nthese percentage changes equate to changes in concentration that would be very difficult to detect.  369 \nNote that the concentration of isoprene, and that of each species derived exclusively from its 370 \noxidation, decreases by 100% in Sink 2 and Sink+Source because the emissions from vegetation, 371 \nwhich comprise the only source of isoprene in the model, are removed in these experiments. 372 \n 373 \nEthane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4) and propane (C3H8) show substantially different sensitivities in Sink 374 \n1 and Source 1, decreasing by 50-60% and 10-15% respectively.  Furthermore, these percentage 375 \nchanges equate to non-negligible changes in concentration, of between 1 and 10 pptv.  However, 376 \njust as it is difficult to differentiate between changes in methane emissions and changes in OH, so it 377 \nwould be difficult to differentiate between changes in the sources and sinks of these hydrocarbons, 378 \nsince oxidation by OH also comprises their main sink.  To infer changes in OH from changes in 379 \ntheir concentrations, we would need to know if and how their emissions had changed between the 380 \nLGM and the PI. 381 \n 382 \nCarbon monoxide (CO) exhibits a moderate difference in sensitivity in the first pair of experiments, 383 \ndecreasing by 56% in Sink 1 and 26% in Source 1.  Furthermore, these percentage changes equate 384 \n18 \n \nto sizeable changes in concentration, of the order of 10 ppbv.  However, since its concentration 385 \nchanges in the same sense (decreases) in both experiments, a change in its concentration could not 386 \nbe attributed unambiguously to a particular factor affecting methane, in the absence of additional 387 \ninformation.  Also, the production of CO within the snow-pack as a result of the photochemical 388 \ndecomposition of other organic species, such as peroxides and formaldehyde, could complicate the 389 \ninterpretation of changes in CO preserved in the ice record [see, e.g., Haan et al., 2001].  It is 390 \npossible, however, that some information regarding the cause of the LGM-PI change in methane 391 \ncould be gleaned from measurements of the mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in 392 \nCO, \uf04417OCO = \uf06417OCO - 0.52 \uf06418OCO.  Measurements indicate that CO exhibits \uf04417OCO=0 at the point 393 \nof emission from a variety of CO sources including biomass burning [Huff and Thiemens, 1998], 394 \nbut increasingly positive \uf04417OCO values downstream that, based on the work of R\u00f6ckmann et al. 395 \n[1998b], are attributable to the oxidation of CO by OH.  In Section 4, we will discuss what potential 396 \nthere is to infer any change in oxidizing capacity that took place between the LGM and the PI from 397 \nmeasurements of \uf04417OCO performed on CO trapped in polar ice. 398 \n 399 \nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the only non-radical species whose concentration appears to change in 400 \nan opposite sense (i.e. either increases or decreases) depending on the cause of the change in 401 \nmethane, increasing in Sink 1 by 8% and decreasing in Source 1 by 16%.  Although small, these 402 \npercentage changes equate to non-negligible changes in concentration, of the order of 10 pptv.  We 403 \nnote, however, that H2O2 decreases in Sink 2, Source 2 and Sink+Source, by 38%, 7% and 46% 404 \nrespectively.  It will therefore be less useful in differentiating between changes in methane 405 \nemissions and changes in OH, if the latter are driven by changes in emissions from vegetation; we 406 \nwould be reliant on inferring something from the magnitude of the change in H2O2 concentration. 407 \n 408 \nPeroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) shows only a modest difference in sensitivity, decreasing by 30% in 409 \nSink 1 and 1% in Source 1.  However, the lack of sensitivity that PAN shows to changes in methane 410 \n19 \n \nemissions (confirmed in Source 2) could make it a useful indicator of changes in OH.  We note that 411 \nPAN shows a particularly strong sensitivity to changes in the emissions from vegetation, decreasing 412 \nby 98% in Sink 2 and Sink+Source.  This presumably reflects the near-complete removal of 413 \nNMVOCs (see Table 1) from which CH3CO3 radicals, which combine with NO2 to form PAN, are 414 \nderived.  We would similarly expect PAN to change in response to changes in NOx emissions.  415 \nChanges in climate could also affect PAN, by altering its lifetime with respect to thermal 416 \ndecomposition.  We have not, however, explored these additional sensitivities.  In Section 4, we 417 \nwill discuss the likelihood that PAN is preserved in the ice record. 418 \n 419 \nFormaldehyde (HCHO) also shows a modest difference in sensitivity, decreasing by 11% in Sink 1 420 \nand 40% in Source 1.  However, the value previously recognized in HCHO [see Staffelbach et al., 421 \n1991] lies in its close relationship with methane and OH.  Assuming a steady state between HCHO 422 \nproduction by methane oxidation and HCHO loss by photolysis and reaction with OH, Staffelbach 423 \net al. [1991] proposed a formula to relate the concentrations of HCHO, methane and OH in remote 424 \nregions (i.e. far from HCHO sources): equation 1, where k1 and k2 are the rate coefficients for the 425 \noxidation by OH of methane and HCHO, respectively, and kp is the J-value for HCHO photolysis. 426 \n 427 \n].[\n]].[.[][\n2\n41\nOHkk\nCHOHkHCHO\np \uf02b\n\uf03d   that rearranges to   \n].[].[\n].[\n][\n241 HCHOkCHk\nHCHOk\nOH p \uf02d\uf03d  (1) 428 \n 429 \nStaffelbach et al. [1991] went on to suggest that contemporaneous measurements of HCHO and 430 \nmethane could be used to estimate past OH concentrations.  To test the proposed relationship 431 \nbetween atmospheric HCHO, methane and OH, we have calculated how we would expect AntBL 432 \nOH to change in each sensitivity experiment based on the modeled changes in AntBL HCHO and 433 \nmethane.  These are compared with the modeled changes in AntBL OH (previously shown in Table 434 \n20 \n \n2) in Table 3.  For these calculations, we have used the same rate coefficients (k1 and k2) as used in 435 \nthe model, subject to the model\u2019s annual-mean AntBL temperature (246K in 1998, 1999 and 2000). 436 \n 437 \nIt would appear that reasonable estimates of changes in AntBL OH can be obtained from known 438 \nchanges in AntBL HCHO and methane; the discrepancies are likely to be at least partly attributable 439 \nto the production of HCHO via NMVOC oxidation, which is not included in equation 1, and the 440 \ntransport of HCHO into, and out of, the AntBL.  The change in the concentration of OH in the 441 \nAntBL may, however, be of limited use in inferring the cause of a change in methane, as OH in the 442 \nAntBL will not be representative of OH at low latitudes (i.e. between 30\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S), where most 443 \nmethane is oxidized [see, e.g., Lawrence et al., 2001; Labrador et al., 2004].  This is most evident 444 \nfrom the results of Sink 2, in which the removal of emissions from vegetation (concentrated at low 445 \nlatitudes; see Figure 1) leads to a 13% increase in the concentration of OH in the AntBL but a 28% 446 \nincrease in the global tropospheric burden of OH.  Additionally, the relationship proposed by 447 \nStaffelbach et al. [1991] does not appear to be capable of differentiating between a purely source-448 \ndriven change in methane, and one which is part source-driven, part-sink driven; using equation 1, 449 \nwe estimate a greater increase in AntBL OH in Source 1 than in Sink+Source, but the model shows 450 \nthe reverse (Table 3). We will, nevertheless, discuss HCHO further in Section 4. 451 \n 452 \nMost of the remaining species show small differences in sensitivity, and hence little potential to 453 \nprovide useful chemical signals.  However, one such species, ozone (O3), warrants further attention, 454 \nas does H2O2 (already mentioned), in light of the large difference in sensitivity OH exhibits, and the 455 \nlink identified by Savarino et al. [2000] between the relative importance of different S(IV)-456 \noxidation pathways and the mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in sulfates, 457 \n\uf04417Osulfates = \uf06417Osulfates - 0.512 \uf06418Osulfates.  According to Savarino et al. [2000], \uf04417Osulfates is 458 \nattributable to the transfer of \uf04417O anomalies in tropospheric O3 and H2O2, 31\u2030 [Johnston and 459 \nThiemens, 1997] and 1.7\u2030 [Savarino and Thiemens, 1999] respectively, to sulfates as they oxidize 460 \n21 \n \nsulfur dioxide (SO2) in the aqueous phase; OH exhibits near-zero \uf04417O anomalies in the troposphere 461 \n[Lyons, 2001], and no anomaly is transferred as it oxidizes SO2 in the gas phase [Savarino et al., 462 \n2000].  All else being equal, therefore, a change in the relative concentrations of OH, O3 and H2O2, 463 \nwhere the SO2 is oxidized, should to lead to a change in \uf04417Osulfates.  Given the large \uf04417O anomaly 464 \nin O3, \uf04417Osulfates will be most sensitive to changes in the [O3]\/[OH] and [O3]\/[H2O2] ratios.  Table 4 465 \ngives the percentage changes in these ratios in the AntBL, based on the changes in annual-mean 466 \nOH, O3 and H2O2 concentrations calculated in each sensitivity experiment. 467 \n 468 \nThe [O3]\/[OH] ratio decreases in all five sensitivity experiments.  All else being equal, this should 469 \nlead to a reduction in the \uf04417O in sulfates formed in the AntBL.  However, with the exception of 470 \nSink 1, in which we artificially increase the strength of the OH source, the [O3]\/[H2O2] ratio 471 \nincreases in each experiment, tending to increase the \uf04417O in the sulfates formed here.  As we do 472 \nnot know what proportions of SO2 were oxidized by OH, O3 and H2O2 in the PI AntBL, we cannot 473 \nsay what the net effect of these changes would be, and it remains to be seen what difference in 474 \nsensitivity \uf04417Osulfates shows to changes in OH\/methane emissions.  These proportions could be 475 \nestimated using a general circulation model with interactive aerosol dynamics and appropriate 476 \nchemistry, such as that employed by Cosme et al. [2002] in the Laboratoire de Meteorologie 477 \nDynamique-Zoom Tracers model, as could the influence the \uf04417O in sulfates formed upwind of the 478 \nAntBL has on the \uf04417Osulfates in this region.  However, to accurately model, not only the 479 \ndistributions of SO2, OH, O3 and H2O2, but also that of liquid water (necessary for SO2-oxidation in 480 \nthe aqueous phase), and the transport of air to the AntBL, would pose a formidable challenge.  With 481 \nthis in mind, we will discuss in Section 4 what potential the \uf04417Osulfates preserved in Antarctic ice 482 \n[see, e.g., Alexander et al., 2002; Savarino et al., 2003] has to constrain the cause of the LGM-PI 483 \nchange in methane. 484 \n 485 \n 486 \n22 \n \n3.3 Inter-annual variability in meteorology 487 \n 488 \nUntil now, we have only examined annual-mean concentrations, and percentage changes therein, 489 \naveraged over three model years.  However, since the three model years employ different 490 \nmeteorological analyses, we have an opportunity to explore inter-annual variations in the chemical 491 \ncomposition of the AntBL resulting from changes in meteorology, specifically to assess whether or 492 \nnot the chemical sensitivities described in the previous section prove robust to these.  Table 2 gives 493 \nthe mean sensitivity exhibited by each species in each of the five sensitivity experiments and their 494 \nstandard deviations.  The sensitivities exhibited by the majority of species show little variability, 495 \ntheir standard deviations being equivalent to around 10% of their mean values, or less.  Those 496 \nexhibited by HONO, HONO2 and N2O5 show greater variability, as do those of C5H8, PPAN and a 497 \nnumber of radical species (not shown in Table 2).  However, importantly, none of the sensitivities 498 \nexhibited by species contributing to potentially useful chemical signals (PAN, HCHO, OH, O3 or 499 \nH2O2) show much variability: they prove robust to inter-annual changes in meteorology. 500 \n 501 \n 502 \n3.4 The definition of the AntBL 503 \n 504 \nThe model\u2019s ability to capture the structure of the AntBL, particularly its shallow depth under stable 505 \nconditions [Davis et al., 2004; Anderson and Neff, 2008], is limited by the vertical resolution of the 506 \nmodel, the lowest level being at least 100m deep, and the quality of the meteorological analyses 507 \nwith which it is driven; see Section 2.1 for more details on the model.  Recall, for the purposes of 508 \nthis study, the AntBL was simply defined to comprise all grid boxes in the lowest level of the 509 \nmodel, located south of 70\u00b0S.  To assess how sensitive our results are to this somewhat arbitrary 510 \ndefinition, we have repeated our analysis using two alternative definitions, comprising: all grid 511 \nboxes in the second lowest level of the model south of 70\u00b0S; and all grid boxes in the lowest level 512 \n23 \n \nof the model south of 80\u00b0S.  Subject to each definition, we calculate a slightly different (area-513 \nweighted) average AntBL concentration for each species in the PI model run and each sensitivity 514 \nexperiment (not shown).  Importantly, however, the percentage change in concentration that each 515 \nspecies shows in each sensitivity experiment, relative to the PI, changes very little\u2015by a few 516 \npercent, at most.  The chemical sensitivities described in Section 3.2 thus prove insensitive to the 517 \nprecise definition of the AntBL employed.518 \n24 \n \n4 Summary and Discussion 519 \n 520 \n4.1 Summary 521 \n 522 \nUsing an atmospheric chemistry-transport model, we have explored the effects of source- and sink-523 \ndriven changes in methane on a wide range of chemical species in the AntBL.  Our aim has been to 524 \nidentify any atmospheric chemical signals that, provided they are preserved in the ice record on the 525 \nnecessary timescales, could help us to differentiate between the source- and sink-driven components 526 \nof the increase in methane between the LGM and the PI [Loulergue et al., 2008].  The majority of 527 \nspecies have been discounted on the basis that: they show too similar sensitivities to changes in 528 \nOH\/methane emissions; they are too reactive to be preserved in the ice on the necessary timescales 529 \n(e.g. radical species); they exhibit negligible concentrations in the PI AntBL (e.g. isoprene and its 530 \noxidation products); and\/or additional, unknown information is required to interpret changes in their 531 \nconcentrations, such as if and how their source strengths have changed (e.g. other hydrocarbons).  532 \nFour signals, however, warrant further discussion regarding their preservation in Antarctic ice and 533 \nissues surrounding their interpretation: the concentration of PAN; the mass-independent 534 \nfractionation of oxygen isotopes in sulfates, \uf04417Osulfates, and CO, \uf04417OCO; and the concentration of 535 \nHCHO. 536 \n 537 \n 538 \n4.2 PAN: short-term preservation in the Antarctic-ice record 539 \n 540 \nBased on our calculations, changes in the concentration of PAN in the AntBL could be indicative of 541 \nchanges in OH and\/or changes in NMVOC emissions from vegetation\u2014a potential driver of 542 \nchanges in OH.  We note, however, that the concentration of PAN would also be affected by 543 \n25 \n \nchanges in NOx emissions and temperature, which have not been explored; see Section 3.2 for more 544 \ndetails. 545 \n 546 \nIn theory, PAN could be preserved in the ice record in either the gas phase (in air bubbles trapped 547 \nwithin the ice) or in aqueous solution (within the ice itself).  As a result of wind-pumping and\/or 548 \nrapid accumulation, gaseous PAN could quickly reach depths in the snowpack to which light does 549 \nnot penetrate.  Here, photolysis and oxidation by OH will cease, however, thermal decomposition 550 \nand dissolution will continue.  Based on the kinetic data of Bridier et al. [1991], we estimate that the 551 \nlifetime of PAN with respect to thermal decomposition will vary between about a week in summer 552 \n(assuming a temperature of 265K) and roughly a decade in winter (assuming a temperature of 553 \n235K).  It is therefore unlikely that PAN will survive in the gas phase for more than, at most, 30-40 554 \nyears (3-4 e-folding lifetimes).  According to Kames and Schurath [1995], that which survives 555 \ndecomposition, but instead undergoes dissolution, will be hydrolyzed on timescales of the order of 556 \nan hour.  We conclude that PAN will not be preserved, either in the gas phase or in aqueous 557 \nsolution, on the timescales necessary to explore changes in OH\/methane emissions between the 558 \nLGM and the PI. 559 \n 560 \n 561 \n4.3 \uf04417Osulfates: limited potential to constrain the cause of the LGM-PI change in methane 562 \n 563 \nSamples from the Vostok ice core (East Antarctica) indicate that \uf04417Osulfates was about 2\u2030 lower 564 \nduring the last glacial period (\u02dc60ka before present) than in the early Holocene (\u02dc10ka before 565 \npresent) [Alexander et al., 2002].  The question is, what can we infer from this regarding the cause 566 \nof the change in methane between the LGM and the PI?  Alexander et al. [2002] primarily attribute 567 \nthe change in \uf04417Osulfates to a change in the relative concentrations of OH, O3 and H2O2 in the 568 \ntroposphere, and\/or a change in cloud-processing efficiency (i.e. the availability of liquid water for 569 \n26 \n \naqueous-phase SO2-oxidation), but identify a number of other factors that could have also affected 570 \n\uf04417Osulfates: the fraction of sulfates from primary sources, which exhibit \uf04417O=0 and thus dilute non-571 \nzero \uf04417Osulfates; the pH of water droplets in the atmosphere, which affects the amount of SO2 572 \noxidized by O3, as opposed to H2O2, in the aqueous phase [Seinfield and Pandis, 1998]; and the 573 \ndynamics of the troposphere, which govern the transport of air to the Vostok site.  Even if these 574 \nadditional factors could be discounted, or their effects on \uf04417Osulfates accurately quantified, it would 575 \nstill be very difficult to deduce, quantitatively, how the relative concentrations of OH, O3 and H2O2 576 \nchanged during the glacial-interglacial transition, this being convolved with the influence of any 577 \nchange in cloud-processing efficiency that accompanied the change in climate. 578 \n 579 \nThe only way we can see of quantitatively exploring how changes in the relative concentrations of 580 \nthese oxidants may have contributed to the change in \uf04417Osulfates is to use a general circulation 581 \nmodel with interactive aerosol dynamics and appropriate chemistry to simulate \uf04417Osulfates, subject 582 \nto a variety of meteorological and trace-gas emissions scenarios.  Verma et al. [2007] used such a 583 \nmodel to explore the present-day atmospheric sulfur budget, finding OH, O3 and H2O2 to be 584 \nresponsible, annually, for 29%, 30% and 41% of SO2-oxidation globally; see Benkovitz et al. 585 \n[2006] and Berglen et al. [2004] for similar calculations.  Using existing knowledge of the \uf04417O 586 \nanomalies in tropospheric O3 and H2O2 [Johnston and Thiemens, 1997; Savarino and Thiemens, 587 \n1999], the transfer of these to sulfates via SO2-oxidation [Savarino et al., 2000], and the dilution of 588 \nthese by the mixing-in of primary sulfates [see, e.g., Alexander et al., 2002], the \uf04417Osulfates at the 589 \nVostok site could be simulated; such an approach has been taken to quantitatively interpret recent 590 \nobservations of \uf04417Osulfates in the Indian Ocean marine boundary layer, and at the Alert station in the 591 \nArctic [see Alexander et al., 2005, 2009].  It is unlikely, however, that only one 592 \nmeteorological\/trace-gas emission scenario would be found that could account for the reduction in 593 \n\uf04417Osulfates during the glacial period (to within the uncertainty of the measurements); recall, we 594 \nfound that the [O3]\/[OH] and [O3]\/[H2O2] ratios, at least in the AntBL, responded in the same sense 595 \n27 \n \nto an increase in OH (driven by a reduction in NMVOC emissions from vegetation) and\/or a 596 \nreduction in methane emissions; see Section 3.2.  Furthermore, given the lifetime of sulfate aerosol, 597 \n\uf04417Osulfates in Antarctic ice could reflect changes in oxidative conditions over much of the Southern 598 \nOcean, but is unlikely to tell us much about changes in OH at low latitudes, where most methane is 599 \noxidized [see, e.g., Lawrence et al., 2001; Labrador et al., 2004].  Coupled to the large uncertainties 600 \nin meteorology and chemistry, to which simulations of \uf04417Osulfates would be subject, we conclude 601 \nthat \uf04417Osulfates has limited potential to constrain the cause of the LGM-PI change in methane. 602 \n 603 \n 604 \n4.4 \uf04417OCO: some potential to constrain the cause of the LGM-PI change in methane 605 \n 606 \nRecords of atmospheric CO concentration spanning the last 200 and 2000 years have been obtained 607 \nfrom Antarctic and Greenland ice cores [Haan et al., 1996; Haan and Raynaud, 1998].  However, it 608 \nremains to be seen whether an ice-core record of \uf04417OCO spanning the last 21ka can be obtained, 609 \nand the extent to which an accurate record of atmospheric \uf04417OCO could be derived from it; any CO 610 \nproduced in the snowpack [see Haan et al., 2001], assuming this exhibits \uf04417OCO=0, would dilute 611 \nthe non-zero atmospheric \uf04417OCO, and any OH present in the uppermost layer of the snowpack, into 612 \nwhich light can penetrate, could continue to alter \uf04417OCO.  But if we suppose a suitable record of 613 \natmospheric \uf04417OCO could be obtained, based on the work of Huff and Thiemens [1998] and 614 \nR\u00f6ckmann et al. [1998b], it would contain information on the degree to which CO transported to the 615 \nice-core site had been exposed to OH\u2015an average over all air parcels transported to that site, 616 \nsmoothed on the timescale it took sufficient snow to accumulate, and compress under its own 617 \nweight, to the point of the closure. 618 \n 619 \n28 \n \n\uf04417OCO has some advantages over \uf04417Osulphates, so far as inferring a change in oxidizing capacity is 620 \nconcerned: CO has a much longer lifetime, of the order of weeks to months as opposed to days, and 621 \nconsequently \uf04417OCO should contain more information on OH at low latitudes; and the modeling of 622 \n\uf04417OCO would not require the modeling of the distribution of liquid water to the same degree of 623 \naccuracy, since the relevant gas-phase reaction (between CO and OH) is not in direct competition 624 \nwith reactions in the aqueous phase.  However, it would not be trivial to infer quantitative changes 625 \nin OH from changes in \uf04417OCO, since the integrated exposure of CO to OH is a function, not only of 626 \nthe OH concentrations present between the source of CO and the site of the ice core, but also the 627 \ntime for which the CO is exposed to those concentrations of OH, which is dependent on two factors 628 \nthat could change with climate: the location of the CO source; and the atmospheric circulation 629 \ngoverning its transport to the ice-core site.  The changes in \uf04417OCO due to changes in OH would 630 \nalso have to be separated from those due to changes in the amount of CO produced via the 631 \nozonolysis of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as isoprene and terpenes [R\u00f6ckmann et al., 1998a].  632 \nWe therefore conclude that \uf04417OCO may have some potential to constrain the cause of the LGM-PI 633 \nchange in methane, but further work is needed before this can be fully assessed. 634 \n 635 \n 636 \n4.5 HCHO: synchronization of gas- and aqueous-phase Antarctic-ice records 637 \n 638 \nEver since it was proposed by Staffelbach et al. [1991], there has been considerable interest in the 639 \nuse of contemporaneous measurements of HCHO and methane to estimate past OH concentrations.  640 \nOur calculations confirm that, at least in our model domain, reasonably good estimates of changes 641 \nin AntBL OH can be obtained from known changes in AntBL HCHO and methane using their 642 \nformula: equation 1 in Section 3.2.  However, we face two problems with regards to using the 643 \nHCHO preserved in Antarctic ice to determine the cause of the LGM-PI change in methane.  644 \nFirstly, the concentration of HCHO preserved in the ice differs from that which was present in the 645 \n29 \n \nboundary layer, at the time of deposition, as a result of physical processes operating during and 646 \npost-deposition [Hutterli et al., 1999, 2002]; if we were not focused on the pristine environment of 647 \nthe PI AntBL, we would also have to consider HCHO production within the snowpack [Sumner and 648 \nShepson, 1999; Domin\u00e9 and Shepson, 2002].  The physical processes operate to greater or lesser 649 \nextents depending on a number of climatic variables: the temperature, the degree to which the 650 \nsnowpack is ventilated, and the rate and seasonality of accumulation.  According to Hutterli et al. 651 \n[2003], the preservation of HCHO is not especially sensitive to changes in ventilation, whilst past 652 \ntemperatures and accumulation rates can be determined from measurements of \uf06418O and annual-653 \nlayer thickness respectively.  However, uncertainty surrounding past changes in the seasonality of 654 \naccumulation make it a formidable challenge to obtain a reliable record of AntBL HCHO during 655 \nperiods of climate change, such as that between the LGM and the PI.  The second problem is that 656 \neven if we were able to obtain a reliable record of AntBL HCHO, and thereby infer a change in 657 \nAntBL OH, we still would not know if, and how, the oxidizing capacity had changed at lower 658 \nlatitudes, where most methane is oxidized [see, e.g., Lawrence et al., 2001; Labrador et al., 2004]. 659 \n 660 \nIn one respect, however, the Antarctic-ice record of HCHO does have potential: to synchronize the 661 \ngas- and aqueous-phase Antarctic-ice records.  The gas-phase record includes information regarding 662 \npast atmospheric CO2 concentrations, whilst the aqueous-phase record holds information on past 663 \nchanges in temperature (\uf06418O).  Precisely determining the phasing between the changes in CO2 and 664 \ntemperature requires a synchronization of contemporaneous events in the two records.  This has 665 \nbeen achieved in Greenland by aligning changes in \uf06418O (aqueous phase) and \uf06415N (gas phase) 666 \naccompanying rapid changes in temperature [see, e.g., Severinghaus et al., 1998].  However, the 667 \nchanges in temperature in the Antarctic are not sufficiently rapid to achieve adequate synchronicity, 668 \nand an alternative signal has yet to be identified.  If an aqueous-phase signal could be found that 669 \nresponds to rapid changes in methane preserved in the gas phase, synchronization could be 670 \nachieved. 671 \n30 \n \n 672 \nFigure 4 illustrates measurements of methane concentration (blue line) and temperature (relative to 673 \nthe late Holocene; red line) from Dome C, Antarctica, spanning Dansgaard-Oeschger events 7 and 8 674 \n(roughly 35 and 38ka before 1950); the data are taken from Loulergue et al. [2008] and Jouzel et al. 675 \n[2007] respectively.  The regions shaded grey indicate periods of 200 years at the beginning of 676 \nthese events, in which the concentration of methane increases rapidly by 70-80 ppbv, or 15-20%, 677 \nwhilst the temperature, smoothed on a 200 year timescale (black line), hardly changes.  This is in 678 \nstark contrast to the situation in Greenland, where the rapid changes in methane concentration took 679 \nplace during periods of rapid climate change, which would have influenced the preservation of 680 \nHCHO in Greenland ice [Fuhrer et al. 1993].  In Antarctica, the slowly varying climate should only 681 \nlead to modest and smooth variations in HCHO concentration, on top of which each rapid 15-20% 682 \nrise in methane concentration (recorded in the gas phase) should superimpose a rapid 15-20% rise 683 \nin HCHO concentration (recorded in the aqueous phase); see equation 1 in Section 3.2.  For each 684 \nsuch rise in HCHO concentration that could be detected and aligned with the corresponding rise in 685 \nmethane concentration, the gas- and aqueous-phase Antarctic-ice records could be synchronized.  686 \nThe relative phasing of glacial-interglacial changes in CO2 and temperature in the southern 687 \nhemisphere could thus be determined.  To determine whether CO2 \u2018led\u2019 temperature in this region, 688 \nor temperature \u2018led\u2019 CO2, would represent a key step forward in understanding past climate change. 689 \n 690 \n 691 \n4.6 Concluding remarks 692 \n 693 \nDespite the potentially positive use of HCHO discussed above, our bottom-up model study has not 694 \nreadily identified a chemical signal, likely to be measurable in Antarctic ice cores, that provides a 695 \nsimple and robust constraint on the sizes of the source- and sink-driven changes in atmospheric 696 \nmethane between the LGM and the PI.  We have only explored a domain in which NOx emissions 697 \n31 \n \nand climate remain constant.  However, given the uncertainties associated with the changes in these 698 \nfactors, we would anticipate their inclusion to make it harder still to identify a robust signal.  For the 699 \ntime being at least, we suggest a full understanding of the increase in atmospheric methane between 700 \nthe LGM and the PI will have to rely on a combination of: direct observational constraints on the 701 \nmethane budget in ice cores, such as \uf06413CH4 and \uf064D(CH4) [see, e.g., Fischer et al., 2008]; data 702 \nsyntheses leading to improved quantification of changes in methane (and NMVOC) sources [see, 703 \ne.g., Power et al., 2008]; and comprehensive earth system models with which we can integrate 704 \nthese. 705 \n 706 \n 707 \nAcknowledgements 708 \n 709 \nThis study is part of the British Antarctic Survey Polar Science for Planet Earth Programme and a 710 \ncontribution to the Dynamics of the Earth System and the Ice-core Record project, the latter being 711 \njointly funded by the Natural Environment Research Council\u2019s programme, Quantifying and 712 \nUnderstanding the Earth System, and the French Institut National des Sciences de l\u2019Univers; we 713 \ngratefully acknowledge their support.
