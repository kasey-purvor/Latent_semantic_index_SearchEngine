Differences in HIV\nservicei uptake have been identified, with a growing num-\nber of studies highlighting that men are significantly less\nlikely to get tested for HIV [2-4] or to enroll and adhere to\nantiretroviral treatment (ART) services [5-8]. In South\nAfrica, for example, a survey found that only one out of\nfive people tested for HIV were male [3] and an investiga-\ntion into HIV testing in a multi-country HIV workplace\nprogramme in sub-Saharan Africa found that male\nworkers (22%) compared to female workers (28%) and\nmale spouses (6%) compared to female spouses (18%),\nwere less likely to take advantage of the programme and\nget tested for HIV [9]. Even where an equal proportion of\nmen and women are found to make use of HIV testing\nservices, men are observed to only get tested for HIV after\nbecoming severely ill [4]. It follows from men\u2019s relatively\npoor and delayed uptake of HIV testing services that in\nmany contexts women outnumber men in accessing ART.\nEstimates of ART enrollment in low- and middle-income\ncountries suggest that at the end of 2008, 45% of women\nand 37% of men who qualify for treatment were enrolled\nonto an HIV care and treatment programme [10]. This\ntrend is supported by a systematic review of 21 peer-\nreviewed articles and reports describing the gender distri-\nbution of patients accessing ART in sub-Saharan Africa.\n* Correspondence: m.skovdal@uwc.net\n1Institute of Social Psychology, London School of Economics and Political\nScience, London, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nSkovdal et al.

Also adherence to ART is highly gendered.\nA study in South Africa found that 70% of those who\nmanaged to stay on and adhere to HIV treatment were\nwomen [5] and in Uganda, just over twice as many\nwomen managed to keep viral suppression high after six\nmonths of treatment [8]. These differences, coupled with\nthe fact that men get infected at an older age and thereby\nexperience disease progression faster than women, may\nhelp us understand why the rate of AIDS-related mortality\nin men is higher than in women in many places in Africa\n[11,12], underlining the need to explore the causes of\nmen\u2019s relative disadvantage. Against this background there\nis an urgent need to sketch out the pathways through\nwhich gendered constructions impact on men\u2019s use of\nHIV testing services, uptake of ART and adherence to\nantiretroviral drugs.\nIt is clear from the published work that men face parti-\ncular challenges in accessing and adhering to HIV treat-\nments. Most studies examining the gender distribution of\nHIV services tend to be quantitative, so offer little insight\nto the social processes that contribute to men\u2019s relative\ndisadvantage in HIV service uptake and retention [13].\nHowever, a couple of recent studies point towards social\nconstructions of masculinity as one possible explanation\nfor men\u2019s poor uptake and participation in HIV services.\nIzugbara, Undie et al. [14] found that young male adoles-\ncents in Malawi and Uganda resisted getting tested for\nHIV as they felt it signalled lack of self-confidence and an\nacknowledgement of their vulnerability, traits that con-\nflicted with their male youth identity. Similarly, Fitzgerald,\nCollumbien and Hosegood [15] have highlighted some of\nthe specific challenges facing South African men in partici-\npating in antiretroviral treatment programmes, arguing\nthat gendered expectations and local constructions of mas-\nculinity discouraged some men from disclosing their HIV\nstatus and seeking treatment in fear that they would be\nperceived as failing sons, husbands or breadwinners. Cop-\ning with the stresses of HIV and treatment, many men\nresorted to alcohol, further undermining their treatment\nregimens (ibid.). The problem of \u2018male-unfriendly\u2019 services\nis not confined to the HIV\/AIDS field. In their critique of\ninternational health services research, Lee and Owens [16]\nidentify a general tendency to neglect the socio-cultural\nand geo-political influences on men\u2019s health-related beha-\nviours, arguing that such a neglect often implies that\nmen\u2019s poor health-service uptake is down to individual\nchoice. It is against this background, and in our interest to\nadvance HIV services for men, that we explore how mas-\nculinity serves as a barrier to men\u2019s uptake of HIV testing\nand treatment services in Zimbabwe and highlight the\npathways through which some men manage to resist hege-\nmonic masculinities and enroll onto ART.\nHegemonic masculinity and HIV\/AIDS\nConnell\u2019s [17] theory of hegemonic masculinity, and\nMorrell\u2019s discussions of how hegemonic masculinities are\nframed by the complex dynamics of race and class\ninequalities in southern Africa [18], form the backdrop to\nour interest in differences in health-seeking behaviours of\nmen and women in the context of HIV\/AIDS. Connell\n[17] defines hegemonic masculinity as the enactment of\nan idealised form of masculinity (being \u2018the real man\u2019) in\na particular time and place. Whilst hegemonic masculi-\nnity is often seen as a process that is both subordinating\nof women, as well as other forms of masculinities (such\nas those exhibited by homosexuals), we argue in this\npaper that men\u2019s enactment of social constructed ver-\nsions of manhood can also have a subordinating role, by\npreventing them from taking advantage of life-saving\nHIV services [19]. This resonates with Clatterbaugh\u2019s\n[20] argument that, as men participate in the construc-\ntion of powerful masculinities and patriarchies, they\noften place themselves in a disadvantaged position when\nit comes to health care access. Views of men and their\nbehaviours associated with hegemonic masculinities can\ntherefore be deeply restrictive to men [16].\nNeedless to say, dominant forms of masculinity more\noften than not work to men\u2019s advantage in all sorts of\nways, particularly in relation to their privileged access to\npower and influence in the socio-economic and political\nspheres, and also often in the private sphere. Just to cite\none example of this complexity, Campbell [19,21] tracks\nthe complex mix of ways in which migrant labour and\npoverty shape masculinities of southern African migrant\nmineworkers in ways that both promote and undermine\nmen\u2019s well-being. Thus, for example, her study highlights\nthe way in which hegemonic masculinities promote male\nsurvival in dangerous and difficult work conditions in\nmines in South Africa - yet at the same time, and in line\nwith the argument of this paper, place men at greater risk\nof HIV as they spend their evenings away from home with\ndifferent sexual partners.\nAs the pathways through which hegemonic masculinities\nimpact on HIV service uptake and ART adherence are\ncomplex and multi-faceted, we use two inter-linked con-\nceptual tools alongside Connell\u2019s notion of hegemonic\nmasculinity to frame our own findings. Social representa-\ntions theory enables us to view hegemonic and other mas-\nculinities as continually in the making, providing a\ntheoretical space for us to consider ways in which masculi-\nnities might be contested and transformed in specific set-\ntings. The notion of therapeutic citizenship enables us to\nhighlight ways in which characteristics of hegemonic\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 2 of 14\nmasculinity may stand in a problematic relationship with\nthe practical requirements of health service and drug treat-\nment settings. Each is discussed below.\nSocial representations of masculinity\nThe first theory informing our work is social representa-\ntions theory (SRT). Social representations are forms of\nknowledge that are socially constructed, including values,\nideas and practices, which enable people to orientate\nthemselves in their social world [22]. These include local\nconstructions of gender and gendered identities. In the\nprocess of identifying themselves as men, individual men\nwill have to situate themselves in relation to the norms\nand representations that define dominant notions of mas-\nculinity in particular contexts [23-25]. SRT views socially\nconstructed knowledge systems and identities as\ndynamic, rather than static, and capable of transforma-\ntion through interaction between people, groups and\norganisations (ibid.). This suggests that, under the right\nconditions and provided with opportunities, men can\nrenegotiate and critically engage with social representa-\ntions of what constitutes a \u2018real man\u2019 in a particular\ncontext.\nStudies in South Africa [25] have alluded to some of the\ntraits that men in certain cultural contexts are expected to\npossess. These include being tough, unemotional, aggres-\nsive, denying weakness, sexually unstoppable, appearing\nphysically strong and in competition with other men.\nHowever, as Courtenay [26] highlights, men are not only\nconditioned and socialised by social representations of\nmanhood, they are also active agents in constructing and\nenacting these representations in their own lives. Disen-\ngagement with health services and carelessness of health\nand well-being may be one way to demonstrate hegemonic\nmasculinity [26]. Furthermore, health-risk behaviours,\nsuch as having unprotected sex and multiple sexual part-\nners, may be directly associated with virility and therefore\na way to assert their manliness in society [23-25,27].\nTaking this to the extreme, men in a particular context in\nMalawi were found to speak about HIV as something of a\nsymbol of their manhood [28]. But in what ways do social\nrepresentations and local constructions of masculinity\ninteract and conflict with AIDS treatment?\nGendering of therapeutic citizenship\nThe concept of therapeutic citizenship provides a useful\nframe for our investigation of the interface between mas-\nculinity and AIDS treatment. Developed through work in\nWest Africa, Nguyen and colleagues [29,30] report on\nthe socio-cultural and historical context of ART access\nand adherence in Africa. They define therapeutic citizen-\nship in terms of the identities and associated practices\nthat ART patients need to adopt in order to gain access\nto the very limited supply of HIV services available to\nthem [29,30]. This framework allows us to move beyond\na narrow focus on locally circumscribed cultural contexts\nof treatment, widening our lens to take account of global\nassemblages of organisations, norms and practices which\nconstitute the global public health framework within\nwhich ART treatment is conceptualised and provided,\nand, more specifically, the interface between this global\nassemblage and HIV services in local settings. Nguyen\ndefines therapeutic citizenship as \u201ca biopolitical citizen-\nship, a system of claims and ethical projects that arise out\nof the conjugation of techniques used to govern popula-\ntions and manage individual bodies\u201d, which may not\nalways fit well with the local identities of those who at\nthe receiving ends of biomedical treatment regimes [[29]:\np.126]. Nguyen argues for an understanding of HIV\nservice provision that views even local settings as the cul-\nmination of a hybrid of discourses and practices of bio-\nmedics, policy makers and service providers world-wide.\nIn this vein, Richey [31] highlights how the requirements\nof therapeutic citizenship may conflict with social expecta-\ntions and social identities at a local level. In her study on\nART and reproductive health services in South Africa,\nRichey found women of reproductive age and on ART had\nto negotiate between being good therapeutic citizens (glo-\nbal expectation) and fulfilling their social position as sex-\nual beings with a wish and role to procreate (local\nexpectation). She argues that more attention needs to be\ngiven to the gendering of biomedical interventions such as\nART, something we seek to do in this paper in relation to\nmasculinity. To do this we explore how ART may conflict\nwith local versions of manhood. A study and review com-\nmissioned by the World Bank highlights a common per-\nception among men in sub-Saharan Africa that clinics are\n\u2018female spaces\u2019 and that a real man does not fall ill [32]. It\nis clear that such perceptions may prevent some men\nfrom accessing services. Acknowledging this dilemma,\nColvin and Robins [33], through their work with South\nAfrican support groups for men with HIV, highlight how\nsupport groups can provide men with a social space to\nnegotiate questions of masculinity and identity, enabling\nthem to develop new kinds of masculinities that are more\naligned to the therapeutic citizenship that is required for\nthem to access and adhere to ART. To understand the\nprocesses that prevent men from accessing HIV services\nand the ways in which men negotiate new masculinities in\norder to access and adhere to ART, we seek to expand on\nthis early work by explicitly exploring the role of hegemo-\nnic masculinities in ART provision.\nIn summary, men\u2019s health beliefs and behaviours are\nboth conditioned by socially constructed expectations of\nwhat it means to be a man and are deliberately enacted\nby men to demonstrate their \u2018manhood\u2019, taking an active\nrole in constructing dominant norms of masculinity.\nThis, coupled with the expectations of how an AIDS\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 3 of 14\npatient should behave in order to access biomedical\nservices, highlights the importance of mapping out the\nways in which masculinity is socially negotiated and\ntransformed and continues to limit many men\u2019s uptake\nof HIV services.\nMethodology\nWe report on a qualitative case study to answer the\nfollowing research question: What factors limit the\nuptake of HIV services by men in rural Zimbabwe? We\naddress this question using data from a larger study of\nHIV services in Zimbabwe. Ethical permission to con-\nduct this study was granted by the Medical Research\nCouncil of Zimbabwe (A\/681) and Imperial College\nLondon (ICREC_9_3_13). Informed and written consent\nwas gathered from all research participants with the\nagreement that their identities would not be revealed.\nPseudonyms have been used throughout.\nStudy area and sampling\nWe conducted the study in the Manicaland province of\neastern Zimbabwe where the HIV rate is estimated at\n18% [34]. Informants were recruited from health centres\nin three sub-locations of Manicaland. The areas are char-\nacterised by poverty and residents in this area are primar-\nily subsistence farmers living in rural homesteads, often\nwithout electricity or plumbing. Many of those in formal\nemployment (predominantly men) tend to work in the\ncities and send money back to their rural homes. Many\nfamilies, particularly those affected by AIDS, rely on food\naid from international organizations and the goodwill of\nchurch and community support groups. The health cen-\ntres in our study areas have experienced rapid growth in\nthe number of people accessing ART and deal with fre-\nquent staff, equipment and electricity shortages.\nIn mapping out the social representations of masculi-\nnity that limit men\u2019s uptake of services, we draw on a\nstudy of the user-service interface, involving 78 partici-\npants - including male and female ARV users (n = 53)\nand health staff (n = 25) (see Table 1). We recruited ART\npatients\/carer participants through openly HIV-positive\ncommunity members and from hospital or clinic sites\nand discussed the struggles they faced before accessing\nHIV services. Informants were approached in hospital\nand clinic waiting rooms and invited to participate.\nResearchers\u2019 requests to interview a person on ART were\nonly refused in one case, where the person said he did\nnot have time to participate. Health staff interviewed\nincluded primarily nurses but also included HIV counsel-\nlors, pharmacists and a clerk. Permission to conduct the\nresearch in or around the health facility was granted by\neach health centre\u2019s doctor or nurse-in-charge. Staff\nmembers were subsequently approached individually and\nasked if they were willing to participate; all agreed.\nA limitation of this study is that it does not include\nthose men who may believe that they are HIV positive,\nbut decide not to make use of HIV services. Notwith-\nstanding this limitation, our research interviews con-\ntained a wealth of information about the impacts of\nmasculinity on service uptake, from both nurses and\npatients, with the latter including several men who had\ninitially been reluctant to get tested and treated.\nData collection and analysis\nThis study was part of a wider research project into the\nservice-user interface in the context of ART in Zimbabwe\n[35-40]. We conducted 19 individual and 4 group inter-\nviews with adult ARV users, 21 individual and 3 group\ninterviews with carers for children on ART, and 18 indi-\nvidual and one group interview with health staff (see\nTable 1). Topic guides explored issues surrounding HIV\ntesting, ART uptake and adherence, disclosure of HIV\nand experiences at the health care centre. To gather\nmore specific information about differences and experi-\nences in HIV service access, participants were asked:\n\u2018What factors do you think have the most impact on\naccess?\u2019, \u2018Why do some patients fail to present themselves\nat services?\u2019, \u2018Can you give me an example of a person\nwith HIV who was accessed the services appropriately?\u2019\nand \u2018Can you give me an example of a patient who failed\nto access the services at the best time?\u2019 Most respondents\nvolunteered information about gender differences in\nresponse to these open-ended questions, and the inter-\nviewers used probing questions to gather more detail.\nInterviewers had been alerted to our interest in gender,\nso made a special point of probing any references made\nto this topic. During focus groups with patients, partici-\npants were invited to perform a role play of \u2018a good visit\nto the health centre\u2019 and \u2018a bad visit to the health centre\u2019.\nThese role-plays revealed a great deal about how HIV\nservices users perceive the friendliness and accessibility\nof HIV services for both men and women.\nThe interviews were conducted by three experienced\nShona-speaking fieldworkers who, with permission from\nthe informants, audio-recorded the interviews. All audio\nfiles were translated into English and transcribed by the\nfieldworkers. To thank the informants, FGD participants\nwere given soap, and interviewees were given a T-shirt.\nAll transcripts were imported into Atlas.Ti, a qualitative\nanalysis software package, through which we began cod-\ning the data set. For the aims of this paper, we repeatedly\nread and re-read the interview transcripts for any infor-\nmation relating to factors shaping men\u2019s uptake to ser-\nvices. Using Attride-Stirling\u2019s thematic network analysis,\nwe identified 41 codes, covering 26 basic themes which\nwere further clustered into 9 organising themes, and 3\nglobal themes (Table 2). These global and organising\nthemes form the structure of our findings section.\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 4 of 14\nFindings\nWhilst we did not interview men who had failed to take\nup services ourselves, our data set included a lot of talk\nabout men and services and a general consensus, echo-\ning findings from elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, that\nfewer men than women made use of HIV services and\noften only when seriously ill.\n\u201cEven in our cohorts, we have very few men. We can\ninitiate a cohort of 30 patients, you will find only\none male and the other 29 will be women.\u201d Claudius,\nnurse\nOur informants\u2019 accounts of men\u2019s journey from rea-\nlising they may have HIV and fearing the consequences\nof it, to having come to terms with their status and\nenrolled onto an ART programme, converged on a\nsmall number of common themes which are detailed in\nour thematic analysis.\nSocial constructions of masculinity\nA clear representation of hegemonic masculinity domi-\nnated people\u2019s accounts of their social reality and their\nexplanations of why men did not take advantage of HIV\nservices. Whilst it was clear that not all men subscribed\nto this notion of hegemonic masculinity, and others had\nmanaged to resist it in making the decision to be tested\nand treated, it served as a very clear and identifiable\nreference point in all the interviews. People engaged in\nconstant debate with this notion of masculinity, taking\nup different positions in relation to it, but always using it\nas a yardstick against which they defined themselves.\nCharacteristics of \u2018a real man\u2019\nMen\u2019s experiences of self and other were constructed\naround their accounts of those \u2018manly\u2019 characteristics\nwhich distinguished them as superior from their \u2018weaker\u2019\nfemale counterpart. Men perceived themselves as physi-\ncally strong, tough, resilient, problem solvers and cap-\nable of withstanding \u2018little illnesses\u2019.\n\u201cMen are just stronger in terms of resilience... as\nmen, we have been given toughness such that we\ncan pull through even the most difficult situation.\u201d\nJames, patient\nWomen spoke of men differently and often with an\nawareness of the kind of pressure men were under to be\n\u2018a real man\u2019. As Marta, a nurse, also points out, men do\nnot want to show fear. Men are not supposed to show\nemotion or anxiety about their own welfare. On the\ncontrary, showing they do not care is an essential way\nin which they \u2018perform\u2019 or construct themselves as men.\n\u201cMen, as I see them, don\u2019t want to know about their\nstatus when they are fit and strong, they do not\nwant to appear afraid I think. Not wanting to know\nwhat their status is, is like saying \u2018I\u2019m strong I\u2019m\nstrong\u2019.\u201d Marta, nurse\nCharles comments that such expectations make it par-\nticularly hard to be a man.\n\u201cI feel being a man is really hard in this community.\nOnce you finish school, parents will not help with\nanything if you are a man. It is different with ladies\nwho still receive the support of the family even when\nthey finish school. Men are expected to be hard\nenough and strong enough to look after themselves.\nSo I feel the community expect a lot of toughness\nfrom us men.\u201d Charles, patient\nCharles, a man who had managed to access and bene-\nfit from services, shows some insight into the socially\nconstructed nature of masculinity in this context. In our\nstudy, in accounting for their own acceptance of their\nHIV status and need for help, male patients often\ndescribed themselves as different from other men in this\nregard.\nMen\u2019s roles and responsibilities\nBeing \u2018a real man\u2019 translated into many roles and respon-\nsibilities. Men, for example, were perceived as household\nproviders and the ones to carry out responsibilities\nrequiring physical strength, whilst women do household\nduties such as cooking, cleaning and caring for children.\n\u201cIn terms of household chores, men are supposed to\ndo all the manly duties like looking after livestock\nand doing most of the farming, while women con-\ncentrate with things like fetching water, washing and\ncooking for the whole family. In this community it is\ngenerally men who are supposed to make sure they\nprovide the financial needs of the family, so this\nincludes paying school fees for children.\u201d Emmanuel,\npatient\nTable 1 Summary of participants and research methods\nInterviews Male Female FGD Male Female Participants Male Female\nHealth staff 18 9 9 1 5 2 25 14 11\nARV users 19 13 6 4 8 26 53 21 32\nTotal 37 22 15 5 13 28 78 35 43\nSkovdal et al.

But I don\u2019t see anything wrong in cooking\nand looking after the children when I am at home.\nDoing such chores can help me because, if my wife\nfalls ill, I will be able to cook for her and the chil-\ndren. I just feel I should be prepared for such kind\nof situations.\u201d Carl, patient\nSexuality and manhood\nWhilst a few men, particularly HIV positive men on\nART, managed to renegotiate their masculinity in ways\nthat enabled them to access services, men were generally\nportrayed as engaging in activities that demonstrated\ntheir sexuality and manhood. Men were perceived to be\n\u2018sexually unstoppable\u2019 and whilst men generally needed\nto appear in control, this was one area where men could\nadmit to being out of control, a \u2018weakness\u2019 leading men\nto spend considerable time and money in beer halls.\n\u201cAfter getting drunk, some men lose control and end\nup fondling any woman they come across, that is a\nweakness of men. Also, men can easily spend all\ntheir earnings on alcohol.\u201d Godfrey, patient\nUnlike women, it was considered normative for men\nto have extra-marital relationships. Often these required\nsome level of maintenance, taking much needed money\naway their wives and children. One patient (Samson)\nsaid wives were so used to their husbands\u2019 infidelities\nthat they readily forgave them for it.\n\u201cMen have this weakness of having extra-marital\naffairs if they are married, or just having more than\none girlfriend. It\u2019s unfortunate that women have\nkind of accepted this weakness of men. So much\nthat, if their husbands do that, they are ready to just\nforgive him and move on with life.\u201d Samson, patient\nWhat Samson\u2019s quote underlines is an intrinsic accep-\ntance of local constructions of men\u2019s sexuality. Men\u2019s\nneed to assert their sexuality and manhood is seen as a\n\u2018matter of fact\u2019. Not only does this representation serve\nto justify men\u2019s extra-marital affairs, but it also puts tre-\nmendous pressure on men to perform and demonstrate\ntheir sexuality\/manhood. Men\u2019s sexuality, roles and\nresponsibilities are under threat by HIV\/AIDS, and the\nreactions of many men, as the next section will show,\nserve as barriers to men\u2019s uptake of HIV services.\nBarriers to men\u2019s HIV services uptake\nMen\u2019s fear of HIV\nMany of our research informants spoke of men having a\nprofound fear of HIV, preventing them from timely HIV\ntesting and treatment.\n\u201cMen are generally afraid to be known that they are\nHIV positive. They are shy and they may only come out\nafter they get seriously ill. Some men are afraid that\npeople in the community will laugh at them or look\ndown upon them for being HIV positive.\u201d Johnson,\npatient\nBeing HIV positive not only compromises a man\u2019s sense\nof masculinity, it is also a sign of a man being unable to\ncontrol his sexuality. Whilst having multiple sexual part-\nners is a sign of virility, many men reported feeling embar-\nrassed from failing to protect themselves. Fearing they will\nlose their dignity if found to be HIV positive, many men\nopt to ignore HIV services, or if they have been tested, hide\ntheir status from their wives and do not seek treatment.\n\u201cSometimes they will not even tell the truth to the\nnurses fearing that everyone might know that they\ncontracted an STD from their sleeping around.\nI think this is especially true for men. Some men are\ngetting to the extent of dying with these STDs with-\nout seeking treatment, they even hide such illnesses\nto their wives.\u201d Spencer, patient\nAlthough it may be counterintuitive for men to report\nfeeling guilty and embarrassed about their extra-marital\naffairs when having multiple girlfriends is one way to\ndemonstrate their masculinity, it appears that a healthy\nsexuality is intrinsically linked to a hegemonic masculine\nsexuality. A man who engages in extra-marital sexual rela-\ntionships and gets an embarrassing disease like HIV is per-\nceived to have a weak, diseased, compromised, laughable\nand despicable sexuality - compromising his manhood.\nRelatedly, admitting to such a tainted sexuality may com-\npromise a man\u2019s relationship with his wife. A number of\nmen feared being left alone should their wives learn that\nthey are HIV positive. Also young men feared that their\ntainted sexuality would limit their chances of being with\nwomen and eventually finding a woman who would take of\nthem.\n\u201cFor the young men who are still single, they also\nthink about whether they would still be able to get\nmarried as they fear that their girlfriends may just\nshun them if they test HIV positive.\u201d Sunny, patient\nDelusion, denial and diversion\nMen like to see themselves as all-knowing and domi-\nnant. To admit there is something they do not know\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 7 of 14\nmay imply lack of power and will put them in the posi-\ntion of a \u2018learner\u2019, a subservient and unmanly trait.\nGrounded in a fear of HIV, many men therefore appear\nto be in denial regarding the seriousness of HIV and\nAIDS - preventing them from accessing HIV preventa-\ntive information and from seeking HIV services. As\nSpencer suggests, men will actively avoid spaces where\nAIDS is being discussed.\n\u201cI think the reason that is there is men who don\u2019t\nwant to come out in the open, they want to hide\nand they don\u2019t have the knowledge. If they hear of a\nplace where AIDS is being discussed, they don\u2019t\nwant to go to that place, so men do not have that\nmuch knowledge.\u201d Spencer, patient\nThis, coupled with a demonstration of macho fatalistic\nrisk taking and holding on to very rigid, inflexible and\ninsecure positions, means many men continue to be at\nrisk of HIV.\n\u201cMen are dying and they don\u2019t want to be tested.\nYou hear them saying HIV is like an accident and\npeople cannot stop driving because of accidents, so\nsome men will not change their behavior.\u201d Stuart,\npatient\nMen tell themselves many things to justify their beha-\nviours. For example, some see HIV as a disease that\nonly exceptionally promiscuous men will contract and\ntherefore not at risk themselves. Illustrating the deep\ndenial of HIV in many men, Godfrey describes the dif-\nferent ways in which he sought to deny that he had con-\ntracted HIV.\n\u201cI did my own inventory of the women I had had\nsex with, and I could not even single out one of\nthem as potentially the one who gave me the infec-\ntion. I really did not believe it. Then I used to feel\nthat I was just unlucky because I knew men who\nwere doing worse things but still going on fit. I got\nto the extent of even questioning the existence of\nHIV\/AIDS because I thought, if it really existed, why\nwere some very promiscuous men escaping the\ninfection. I also thought even that machine that was\nused for my HIV tests could have been defective.\u201d\nGodfrey, patient\nWhilst Godfrey blamed the HIV testing procedure in\nhis attempt to avoid the reality of AIDS, other men\nresorted to drinking alcohol. Not only did this contri-\nbute to the continued spread of HIV, but also the avoid-\nance of HIV testing and ARV adherence.\n\u201cSome men will drink so much that they forget to\ntake their drugs, and even forget that they are\npatients on ART.\u201d Carl, patient\nIn an attempt to save some dignity, men were\nreported to blame their wives for bringing HIV into the\nfamily. Whilst no men admitted to blaming their wives,\nthis was commonly reported by nurses and female\npatients.\n\u201cMen are stubborn sometimes. They blame the wives\nfor bringing the disease into the home in an attempt\nto preserve their role as head of household.\u201d Bridget,\npatient\nMasculinity conflicts with \u2018patient persona\u2019\nMany men were also alarmed by what it means to be an\nHIV patient. Not only would men have to admit they\nwere ill and own up to their physical limitations, they\nwould also need to enter female spaces and act in ways\nthat conflicted with hegemonic notions of masculinity.\nTo be enrolled onto ART in this context, patients must\nattend monthly consultations at a hospital. However,\ndue to women\u2019s participation in maternal, infant and\nchild health and related visits to the hospital, hospitals\nare perceived by many men as female spaces, discoura-\nging them from engaging with HIV services in a hospital\nsetting.\n\u201cMen view health issues as female issues. Women\nalways go to the hospital from pregnancy and until\nthe children are grown up. So men feel hospitals and\nhealth concerns are for women.\u201d Michael, patient\nAside from hospitals being perceived as female spaces,\nthere are numerous potential elements of a hospital visit\nthat conflict with masculinity. One challenge that was\nfrequently referred to relates to men\u2019s difficulties in\nshowing up for appointments with health staff.\n\u201cWhen you give them the review dates that you\nwant to give him a counselling session, they do not\nturn up at the time you specify. They just come\nwhen they feel like it - on their own free will time.\nSo men are very difficult to deal with.\u201d Claudius,\nnurse\nDifferent reasons were given to why men struggle\nshowing up for review dates. Men are expected to\nqueue up patiently wait outside the HIV clinic. In doing\nso, a man will not only run the risk of being recognised\nas HIV positive, but will have to let go of any sense of\ncontrol of his time and his freedom, having to follow\ninstructions given to him in this biomedical setting and\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 8 of 14\nwait patiently like \u2018one of the women.\u2019\n\u201cSo men find it hard to just go to the clinic... you\ncan imagine men waiting in these queues here, men\ndo not have a lot of patience to wait in these queues\nbut women are used to coming here and waiting in\nthese queues. A man would really feel belittled to\nwait in these queues the whole day shoving and jos-\ntling with women.\u201d Emmanuel, patient\nSome men explained that they cannot afford to wait a\nwhole day to be seen by a nurse as this compromised\ntheir head-of-house duties. As part of their monthly\nconsultations, ART patients must adhere to a complex\nand strict treatment regimen where pills must be taken\ntimeously and where certain activities are strongly dis-\ncouraged. A number of men explained that their work\nactivities made it difficult for them to carry around their\nmedicine and to take it in a timely manner. Further-\nmore, ART patients are advised to eat healthily, apply\ncreams to sores, quickly respond to potential opportu-\nnistic infections, refrain from unprotected sex, smoking\nand drinking alcohol. These, and many other instruc-\ntions worry men to such an extent that some fear enrol-\nling onto ART.\n\u201cI think some men know that what they are doing is\nnot good for their health, so they fear the nurses\nadvising them to stop a lot of their activities includ-\ning drinking alcohol.\u201d Daya (female), patient\nAs many men fail to abide by what is expected of an\nART patient, at least until they are more comfortable\nwith their new identity as an ART user and have\nadopted a more ART-friendly masculinity, they are sub-\nject to reprimanding from nurses. The frustration\nexperienced by some nurses as a result of men\u2019s inability\nto adhere to treatment results in nurses occasionally giv-\ning up on certain male patients as they repeatedly fail to\nact upon the advice given to them.\nIt is clear that men face numerous barriers in acces-\nsing HIV services. Grounded in a profound fear of HIV\/\nAIDS as well as perceptions and experiences of HIV ser-\nvices, this section has highlighted some of the ways in\nwhich men avoid and delay HIV service use in order to\nprotect or demonstrate their masculinity and dignity.\nWith such strong barriers to HIV services, what oppor-\ntunities are there for men to make use of HIV services?\nFacilitators of men usage of HIV services\nOur discussion above indicates that men face very speci-\nfic challenges in accessing HIV services. However, in the\ncase of our male informants who are now accessing and\nadhering to ART, it has been possible to overcome these\nobstacles and construct new masculine identities more in\nline with the \u2018patient persona\u2019. In this section, we will\nhighlight some of the pathways through which men can\nmake use of HIV services.\nPersuasion and need\nAs men fear the consequences of being HIV positive\nand how it may adversely impact their representation of\ntheir manhood, being persuaded to make use of HIV\nservices from someone whom they trust often served as\na strategy to give men the push they needed to make\nuse of HIV services.\n\u201cMy wife was worried and was always asking about\nmy health. The swellings were not painful to me at\nall, so she was always asking what sort of disease it\nwas. I told her I was fine but she insisted that I should\ngo back to the hospital and show them those swel-\nlings. She would always push for me to go to hospital\nevery day until I felt I should just go to the hospital\nto honour her wish.\u201d Emmanuel, patient\n\u201cUsually we will try all means to make the husband\ncome. We sometimes send a message through village\nhealth workers or we send it through the husband\u2019s\nbest friend to go and talk to him.\u201d Claudius, nurse\nBut not all men could be persuaded and many only\ngot access to HIV services when they were too sick to\nmove and assert their masculinity and ended being\nbrought to the hospital in wheelbarrows.\n\u201cMen will only come to us when they are bedridden\nand brought to us in a wheelbarrow.\u201d Collin, nurse\nThis was the single most frequently mentioned route\nthrough which men arrived at hospital and were initiated\nonto ART. Many of our male participants, who are now\nliving positively and on ART, admitted to also being\nbrought to the hospital in wheel barrows after continu-\nously denying their illness. Having said this, other facilita-\ntors of men\u2019s HIV service usage were identified and study\nparticipants provided us with pointers as to how HIV ser-\nvices and the local environment can help men overcome\ngender-related obstacles.\nGender sensitive HIV management services\nMuch of what we have discussed so far suggests that the\nneed for gender sensitive HIV services. Men require\ncounselling that challenges the versions of masculinity\nthat prevent them from living positively and on ART.\nAlthough these groups were open to both women as well\nas men, rather than men-only spaces as is the case in\nother settings [e.g. [33]] our interviews suggested that\ncounselling was often key to helping our male (patient)\nparticipants come to terms with their HIV status, demys-\ntifying inaccurate perceptions and helping men to step\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 9 of 14\naway from hegemonic notions of masculinity - in favour\nof revised identities that placed key emphasis on pre-\nviously less important roles, such as being a family man\nor playing an active role in encouraging other men\nto make use of available HIV services in a caring and\nsupportive way.\n\u201cTo be honest with you that counseling opened my\neyes to the fact that my HIV status will not necessa-\nrily affect my role in the family, rather my family\nnow understands me better. But initially that feeling\nof being reduced to an HIV sufferer who is good for\nnothing gripped me, but now I am doing well.\u201d\nEmmanuel, patient\nThe health clinics in our study area group ART users\ntogether into (again mixed gender) support groups to\nfacilitate ART adherence. In the support groups, ART\nusers can negotiate and renegotiate identities that help\nthem both navigate through local struggles and meet the\nexpectations of a \u2018patient persona\u2019. As outlined by one\nmale patient (Stephen), the support groups allow men to\ncome to terms with their status through acceptance and\nsupport from other members as well as access food aid.\n\u201cNow we have these support groups that are well\nknown to be a platform for HIV\/AIDS sufferers to\ngive each other support; it was never like that before.\nIn the past, nobody would really want to be asso-\nciated with such a disease, a lot of people now want\nto get tested so that they can also get some food\nwhich is sometimes given to people living with HIV\/\nAIDS.\u201d Stephen, patient\nIt appears that food aid, distributed through support\ngroups for ART users, is highly beneficial to men as it\nallows men to reconcile the \u2018patient persona\u2019 with their\nlocal obligation as breadwinners. This is illustrated by\nthe dramatic increase of men actively seeking HIV test-\ning in the hope that they may be positive and qualify for\nfood aid.\n\u201cI had never seen a man coming to be tested when they\ncould still walk until recently when Africare [NGO pro-\nviding food aid for ART users] came. Now we are see-\ning more men coming for tests.\u201d Lydia, nurse\nThis sub-section has given a few examples of how\nHIV services interact with masculinities and provide a\nplatform for men to construct new and more ART-\nfriendly masculinities.\nConstructing responsible masculinities\nIn order for men to cope with the stresses of HIV and\nto make use of HIV services, they often have to undergo\na remarkable transformation, breaking free from socia-\nlised norms of what it means to be a \u2018real man\u2019 and to\nlive by revised or renewed versions of \u2018manhood\u2019. This\ncan take a while and many men fail to adhere to ART\nas they continue to abide to the traits of hegemonic\nmasculinities. However, with time and through self-\nreflection, as well as the kind of support discussed\nabove, some men are able to construct a new set of\nrepresentations, another version of masculinity, integrat-\ning key traits of hegemonic masculinities with their life\ncircumstances (being HIV positive and on ART). One\ndominant representation that male patients appeared to\nadopt is that of being a responsible and valuable citizen.\nThey are socially responsible because they took the diffi-\ncult step to get tested, have gained a lot of knowledge\n(through counselling and peer support groups) about\nHIV\/AIDS management and now pass this on to the\nfearful \u2018ignorant other.\u2019\n\u201cSo I have learnt a lot from going to counseling, and\nnow I even encourage fellow men to consider getting\ntested rather than them suffering in silence, fearing\nthat they may be told that they are HIV positive.\u201d\nEmmanuel, patient\nFurthermore, in lieu of representations of AIDS-\naffected people as unproductive and a burden, unable to\ncare for their families, many of our male informants\nspoke about how being on ART had enabled them to\nparticipate in productive activities and contribute to the\nlong-term of their family, highlighting their social value.\n\u201cWhat makes me look forward to the future is my\nhealth which is in a good condition. Also my family.\nI look forward to building a good future with my\nfamily.\u201d Nick, patient\nMen often spoke about their role in the family and\nhow ART had enabled them to live up this role. In con-\nstructing socially responsible masculinities, men also\nexplained how they had stopped drinking alcohol or\nwere no longer engaging in extra-marital affairs -\nemphasising their family role.\n\u201cI have also stopped drinking so that I can concen-\ntrate on my treatment [...] I take this programme\nseriously because my family depends on it.\u201d Charles,\npatient\nTheir sense of having some kind of control over their\nhealth and still being able to fulfil some of the key traits\nof being a \u2018real man\u2019 has also been a building block for\nmen to resist derogatory stereotypes from their peers.\nSeeing themselves as responsible and informed and their\nSkovdal et al. Globalization and Health 2011, 7:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\nPage 10 of 14\npeers as fearful and \u2018ignorant\u2019, male ART users are able to\ncreate a distance from otherwise hurtful attitudes and\nactions.\n\u201cThey also use derogatory names and they do it\nopenly, I think they have not yet understood the\nimportance of treating an HIV sufferer as a normal\nhuman being. Maybe they don\u2019t know that we are\njust the same.\u201d Johnson, patient\nThis section has outlined some of the opportunities\nthat exist in this context in facilitating men\u2019s use of HIV\nservices. Men drew on the facilitators in different ways\nand at different stages, highlighting the complex trans-\nformation process, which many men will have to endure\nin order to make use of HIV services.\nDiscussion\nThis study responds to Hirsch\u2019s [13] call for greater\nattention to the social processes that result in gender\ndisparities in HIV service uptake. Although a number of\nstudies have alluded to some of the obstacles men are\nfacing in accessing HIV services as a result of social\nconstructions of masculinity [14,15,32,33], this is the\nfirst in-depth study, as far as we are aware, that set out\nto explore explicitly the role of masculinity in influen-\ncing African men\u2019s use of HIV services.\nOur findings suggest that HIV service uptake in this\ncontext is deeply intertwined with hegemonic masculi-\nnities, intensified by local socio-cultural influences and\nwider global expectations of HIV\/AIDS patients. Hege-\nmonic understandings of masculinity in this cultural con-\ntext define \u2018real men\u2019 as strong, emotionally independent,\ntough and fearless. This, coupled with their role as bread-\nwinners, makes it important for many men to reassert\ntheir masculinity. In the process of doing so, men in this\ncase study sought to avoid HIV\/AIDS services, demon-\nstrating themselves as strong and resilient to illness. They\nalso did so out of fear that their wives would leave them\nif they found out that they had had extra-marital relation-\nships and brought HIV into the family. Men\u2019s fear of HIV\nled them to either refute the presence of HIV, exercising\ndenial of the risky nature of their behaviour, and refusing\nto view themselves at risk of contracting the disease.\nThese factors all contributed to men\u2019s delay in HIV\nservices uptake.\nWe also found evidence that hegemonic masculinities\ncompromised men\u2019s adherence to HIV treatment. Due to\nwomen\u2019s maternal health role, hospitals were perceived\nas predominantly female spaces, and not a place for men\nto be. Furthermore, therapeutic representations, such as\nbeing associated with AIDS, queuing up patiently\namongst women in the hospital and taking instructions\nfrom nurses (who would e.g. instruct HIV positive men\nto stop having multiple partners and drinking alcohol\nand to take an interest in their health, diet and medica-\ntion regimen), made ART inherently male-unfriendly and\ntherefore difficult for men to adhere to. Whilst these are\nsome of the factors that prevent many men in this con-\ntext from making use of HIV services, we also identified\na number of factors that facilitate men\u2019s uptake and\nadherence to ART. In agreement with another study\nfrom Zimbabwe [cf. 4], many men only accessed HIV ser-\nvices when they really needed to, either because their\nfriends and family persuaded them to go and get tested\nand seek treatment, or because they were so ill that their\nfamily brought them to the hospital in wheel barrows.\nBut because many men\u2019s first contact with HIV services\nwas generally not voluntary, counselling services that\nwere considerate of the obstacles that men face in sus-\ntaining their engagement with HIV services were found\nto be a key contributing factor to those who were even-\ntually able to engage in ART uptake and adherence.\nCounselling, support groups and other services (e.g. food\naid) available for ART users, all provided men with a\nplatform to re-construct hegemonic masculinities in such\na way that they become ART-friendly. In doing so, we\nobserved men to construct masculinities that accentuated\nthem as socially responsible citizens, primarily because\nthey took control over their health and family. But also\nbecause they gained a lot of knowledge (through counsel-\nling and peer support groups) about HIV\/AIDS manage-\nment, which they then sought to pass on to their\n\u2018ignorant\u2019 peers. We do however note that, even when\nmen had the opportunity to re-construct their masculi-\nnity, they still seemed to focus on more or less universal\nsocial requirements of manhood, such as the man\u2019s role\nin sustaining his family. The new ART-friendly versions\nof masculinity therefore merely sought to reconcile their\ntherapeutic responsibilities with their pre-existing roles\nas a son, father and husband. This was most clearly illu-\nstrated by the impact of food aid on ART users, as food\naid gave male patients the opportunity to be both an\nART patient and a breadwinner, notwithstanding the fact\nthey received the food as a hand-out, as opposed to\nworking for it.\nOur findings not only suggest there is an urgent need\nto make HIV services more male friendly, but also pro-\nvide some useful pointers to how this can be achieved,\nparticularly through the construction of supportive social\nspaces in which men can re-negotiate more health-\nenhancing gender identities. In agreement with Colvin\nand Robins [33], we argue that social support groups\n(e.g., established by NGOs, local organisations or health\nclinics) can provide men with the necessary space to\nrenegotiate masculinities that are more aligned to their\nengagement with HIV services. We therefore recommend\nstrategies that seek to build safe and supportive social\nSkovdal et al.

Furthermore, to overcome\nlow and delayed HIV service use, we concur with Bwam-\nbale et al. [41] and call for a greater decentralisation of\nHIV services, recommending that testing and counseling\nservices are incorporated into community and home-\nbased programmes, making HIV services more apparent\nat a community-level and removing them from spaces\nthat are perceived as predominantly female (e.g., hospi-\ntals). Our findings also suggest there is a general need for\na more systematic discussion about masculinity at a com-\nmunity-level, acknowledging both the ways in which\nmasculinities favour men and how masculinities serve as\na barrier for men\u2019s access to health services. We therefore\nrecommend the support of school-based and commu-\nnity-driven initiatives that can facilitate such discussion.\nBarker and Ricardo [32] report on eight promising pro-\ngrammes in sub-Saharan Africa that already seek to pro-\nmote gender-equity by engaging young men and they\nhighlight some useful facilitating factors in achieving this:\ni) the endorsement of community leaders who publicly\nsupport the deconstruction of health-damaging masculi-\nnities, ii) the use of role models, iii) mobilizing peer-\nbased groups and safe social spaces, iv) committed and\nsustained funding, v) local and national alliances and vi)\nuse of visual media and fun activities to engage young\nmen.\nOur findings and recommendations should be read\nagainst the fact that although men and boys are compli-\ncit with, subject to or resistant to hegemonic versions of\nmasculinity, they can adopt different parallel positions\nin different contexts and for different audiences [42].\nAlthough we strived to do the study in a relatively\nhomogenous population of working class, poorly edu-\ncated, rural Shona people, we also acknowledge that\nhegemonic masculinities vary from one context to\nanother, influenced by class, educational attainment and\nethnicity [12,43].\nAlthough this paper set out to explore obstacles and\nbarriers to men\u2019s use of HIV services, the findings also\noffer potential explanations - which deserve further\nexploration - to why women fare better in making use\nof HIV services. Numerous references were made to\nhospitals as female spaces, which, coupled with an\nincreasing number of pregnant women getting tested for\nHIV to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission [44],\nhelps women access HIV services relatively early on.\nFurthermore, if the \u2018patient persona\u2019 is characterised by\nwhat locally may be perceived as feminine traits, then\nwhat are simultaneously obstacles to men may well be\nfacilitators to women. Having said this, women\u2019s contin-\nued marginalisation, as well as many social and poverty-\nrelated factors still prevent many women from accessing\nand adhering to HIV treatment in Zimbabwe\n[35,36,38,40].\nConclusion\nA clear and explicit version of hegemonic masculinity\nemerged across our interviews. A \u2018real man\u2019 is strong, in\ncontrol, disease free, sexually promiscuous and the bread-\nwinner of his family. Men are not only expected to abide\nby such representations, but also play an active role in\nconstructing such representations by continually demon-\nstrating their manhood. Such understandings and\ndemonstrations of masculinity conflict sharply with the\nART \u2018patient persona\u2019, which requires men to be con-\ncerned about their health and regularly go to the hospital\n- a space many men see as a \u2018female space\u2019 - take instruc-\ntions from nurses and refrain from unprotected and\nextra-marital sex and alcohol. However, it was equally\nclear that not all men subscribed to it. Once men had\nbeen counselled and had the opportunity to reflect upon\nthe impact of ART on their productivity and social value,\nit was possible for men who had initially subscribed to\nhegemonic masculinities to construct new and more\nART-friendly versions of masculinity - enabling them to\nadhere to their treatment. We conclude that men\u2019s use of\nHIV services depend on (i) the social constructions of\nmasculinity that characterise a context, (ii) the openness\nand ability of the context and men living within it to dis-\ncuss and deconstruct hegemonic masculinities and (iii)\nmen\u2019s on-going negotiation between the \u2018patient persona\u2019\nand social constructions of masculinity, helping them\nconstruct ART-friendly masculinities.\nEndnote\ni HIV services in this paper refer to HIV testing and\nantiretroviral therapy\nAcknowledgements\nWe are forever grateful to all the research participants and would like to also\nextend our gratitude to Kerry Scott, Cynthia Chirwa, Kundai Nhongo, Samuel\nMahunze, Edith Mupandaguta, Reggie Mutsindiri and Simon Zidanha for\ntranslation, transcription, research and logistic assistance.
