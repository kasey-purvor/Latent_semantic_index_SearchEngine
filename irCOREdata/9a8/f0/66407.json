European Associated Laboratory for Gamma-Ray Astronomy, jointly supported by CNRS and MPG\nX-ray binaries are composed of a normal star in orbit around a neutron star or stellar-mass\nblack hole. Radio and X-ray observations have led to the presumption that some X-ray bi-\nnaries called microquasars behave as scaled down active galactic nuclei. Microquasars have\nresolved radio emission that is thought to arise from a relativistic outflow akin to active galac-\ntic nuclei jets, in which particles can be accelerated to large energies. Very high energy \u03b3-rays\nproduced by the interactions of these particles have been observed from several active galactic\nnuclei. Using the High Energy Stereoscopic System, we find evidence for gamma-ray emission\n>100 GeV from a candidate microquasar, LS 5039, showing that particles are also accelerated\nto very high energies in these systems.\n2\nHigh resolution radio maps of X-ray binaries (XRB) have revealed powerful outflows that are similar to the\nrelativistic jets seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN) (1, 2). In both cases, the radio emission is due to synchrotron\nradiation from particles accelerated to high energies. These outflows probably result from the accretion of material\nonto the compact object, albeit on vastly different scales: the mass (size) of black holes in AGN is at least 106\ntimes larger than that of compact objects in XRB. Hence, XRB with resolved radio emission have been dubbed\nmicroquasars, reflecting the suspicion of some fundamental scaling with compact object mass.\nThe kinship should be most evident close to the black hole, where the jet is launched and where the available\nenergy reservoir to accelerate particles is largest. In AGN the particles can reach energies such that their non-\nthermal emission extends to the GeV-TeV \u03b3-ray regime, via Compton upscattering of ambient photons or as a\nresult of high energy hadron interactions. Because of relativistic bulk motion, this emission is most easily seen in\nblazars, where the AGN jet is aligned close to the line-of-sight. Very high energy (VHE) \u03b3-rays are to be expected\nfrom some XRB if the physical processes in the vicinity of the compact object are indeed analogous. However,\nprevious observations of VHE emission from XRB were inconclusive (3).\nTwo XRB have resolved radio emission in the 0.001 arcsecond range, which is presumed associated with a\nrelativistic jet, and possible counterparts in the MeV-GeV domain (4, 5, 6). LS 5039 (RX J1826.2-1450) and LSI\n+61o303 (V615 Cas) are each composed of a massive star in an eccentric orbit around an undetermined compact\nobject (7, 8). Their proposed \u03b3-ray counterparts are respectively localised to 0.5o (3EG J1824-1514) and 0.2o\n(3EG J0241+6103) in the Third Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) catalogue (9), so that\nthe association cannot be considered firm on the basis of positional coincidence alone. The systems are quite\ninconspicuous in x-rays, with low variability and luminosity of \u223c 1034 erg s\u22121 at 1 to 10 keV (10, 11), which is\nabout one-tenth their luminosity above 100 MeV, assuming that the EGRET sources are indeed counterparts. The\n\u03b3-ray spectra measured by EGRET are hard, with photon indexes \u0393 close to 2, which suggests that emission could\nextend to the >100 GeV regime where atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (ACT) arrays operate. Constraining\nthe emission cutoff energy provides important clues as to the physics of the \u03b3-ray source. Furthermore, the XRB\nassociations can be rigorously tested by the superior angular resolution of ACTs.\nLocated in the Southern Hemisphere, LS 5039 is ideally accessible to the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.). H.E.S.S. is an ACT array of four telescopes located in Namibia, each equipped with a 107 m2 mirror\nand a 960\u2013photomultiplier tube camera (12, 13, 14). The telescopes image the Cherenkov light from showers of\nparticles created when VHE \u03b3-rays and cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. A central trigger selects only showers\nseen by at least two telescopes. The combination of high resolution imaging and stereoscopic shower reconstruc-\ntion allows efficient rejection of the background from cosmic ray\u2013initiated showers. The H.E.S.S. 5 \u03c3 sensitivity\nabove 100 GeV reaches 1% of the Crab Nebula flux after 25 hours of observations close to the zenith. The direction\nof each \u03b3-ray shower is determined to 0.1o accuracy, which enables localization of sources in the arc min range\nwithin the 5o field of view.\nThe Galactic Plane survey carried out by the full H.E.S.S. array in the summer of 2004 testifies to the perfor-\nmance of the instrument. In (15) we reported on the discovery of eight extended VHE \u03b3-ray sources within \u00b130o\nof the Galactic Center and \u00b13o of the Plane. After standard quality selection, a total of 25 pointings (10.5 h live\ntime) taken during the scan were found to cover the position of LS 5039. The data were independently analysed\nwith two separate calibration pipelines (16) and several different reconstruction methods, all of which were in\nexcellent agreement with each other. The results presented here are based on a maximum likelihood adjustment of\na shower model to the observed images to obtain the direction, impact parameter, and energy of the primary (17).\nThe likelihood adjustment also provides for each event a probability that is used to select the \u03b3-ray\u2013like events.\nAn image size cut of 60 photoelectrons was applied to avoid systematic effects due to inhomogeneities of the night\nsky background over the field of view, corresponding to an average post-cut spectroscopic energy threshold of\n220 GeV.\nThe reconstructed \u03b3-ray map shows an excess 1o southwest of the previously reported hotspot HESS J1825-\n137 (Fig. 1). The excess on each position is calculated by comparing the number of source events, integrated\nover the instrument point spread function (PSF), against the estimated number of background events in the same\nregion. We find a significance of more than 7\u03c3 for this new source, denoted HESS J1826-148. The source is\n3\npoint-like with a size upper limit of 50\u201d (1\u03c3) given by a likelihood fit to a Gaussian source profile folded through\nthe detector response. This is actually the only point like source discovered in the Galactic scan (15). The best\nposition is \u03b1(J2000)=18h26m15s and \u03b4=-14o49\u201930\u201d (with statistical and systematic uncertainties of\u00b132\u201d and 30\u201d,\nrespectively, comparable to the uncertainties of the other survey sources) (15). The positional accuracy is limited\nby the presence of an extended nearby source and systematics in observations taken at large offsets. On-axis\nobservations should improve the positional error to better than 15\u201d.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectrum was derived from the comparison of reconstructed event energies (in a circle of 6 arc min\naround the source) to the prediction for a given spectral shape (18). The prediction uses energy resolutions and\nsystem acceptances derived from simulations, taking into account the zenith angle pointing of the array and the\noff-axis angle of the shower in the field of view for each observation. We find an acceptable fit (chance probability\nof 7% of getting a worse fit) to a power-law with a photon index \u0393 = 2.12 \u00b1 0.15 (Fig. 2). The low statistics\ncurrently limit further investigation of more complex spectral shapes. The average integral flux above 250 GeV is\n5.1\u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (with statistical and systematic uncertainties of\u00b10.8 and\u00b11.3 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121,\nrespectively), corresponding to a luminosity of \u223c 1033 erg s\u22121 at 3 kpc (11). Errors on the spectral parameters\ncorrespond to 1\u03c3 confidence interval. The highest energy measurement is at \u223c 4 TeV.\nThe positions of the supernova remnant G16.8-1.1 and the pulsar PSR B1822-14, which are both in the error\nbox of the EGRET source and are both plausible \u03b3-ray sources, are inconsistent with the position of HESS J1826-\n148 (Fig. 1). Production of \u03b3-rays from the interaction of cosmic-rays with the interstellar medium is precluded by\nthe low H column density at the location of HESS J1826-148 relative to its surroundings (19). The radio position\nof LS 5039 is 84\u201d away from the H.E.S.S. position and well within the 3\u03c3 confidence region (Fig. 1). We verified\nthat there are no other radio or X-ray sources compatible with HESS J1826-148 in the NRAO VLA 1.4 GHz Sky\nSurvey (20) and in the XMM\/Chandra fields analysed by (21). The observations are not simultaneous with those\nof H.E.S.S. so we cannot formally exclude a long episode of flaring from a blazar. It would be surprising if this\nblazar were not detected in radio, as blazar emission at this wavelength is persistent at levels of \u223c 100 mJy, well\nabove the survey sensitivity (3 mJy for a point source). The present evidence largely favors the association of\nLS 5039 with HESS J1826-148 and, by extrapolation, with the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1824-1514. The\npresent H.E.S.S. data are consistent with a constant flux (Fig. S1). Confirmed \u03b3-ray variability correlated with\nother wavebands or a telltale modulation would fully establish the association.\nSeveral processes can lead to \u03b3-ray emission in LS 5039. The bulk of the luminosity in the system is emitted\nby the O6.5V stellar companion (L\u22c6\u2248 1039 erg s\u22121) at an energy kT\u22c6 \u2248 3.5 eV (Fig. 2). The binary separation\nvaries from 2R\u22c6 to 6R\u22c6 (where R\u22c6\u22487\u00b71011 cm), and the radiation density reaches n\u22c6\u22481014 photons cm\u22123 close to\nthe compact object. These stellar photons can be boosted to \u03b3-ray energies by inverse Compton scattering on VHE\nelectrons (22). With such radiation densities, the energy loss timescale for electrons in the deep Klein-Nishina\nregime, giving a strict upper limit on the radiative timescale, is \u223c300 s. A short radiative timescale relative to the\nescape timescale from the system (\u223c 100 s) implies that inverse Compton emission can be very efficient.\nAccelerating electrons to the required energies may be hindered by such rapid losses. Very high energies may\nbe easier to reach for protons, which suffer fewer radiation losses. VHE \u03b3-rays may then be emitted via proton-\nproton interactions with the stellar wind. Assuming a stellar wind with a mass loss rate of 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\na velocity of 1000 km s\u22121, the density at 2R\u22c6 is \u223c 1010 protons cm\u22123. For such a density the pp interaction\ntimescale is \u223c 105 s. At least 102\/105=0.1% of the protons radiate for free streaming particles, implying a total\nkinetic energy of less than 1038 erg s\u22121. Protons may also interact with stellar photons but the threshold is very\nhigh \u223c 1017 eV. The p\u03b3 timescale is \u223c 103 s.\nPhotons emitted in the H.E.S.S. energy range can interact with the 3.5 eV stellar radiation before leaving the\nsystem, producing e+e\u2212 pairs. The cross-section maximum \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 1.7 \u00b7 10\u221225 cm2 occurs for \u03b3-rays of energy\n\u2248 100 GeV. The opacity is \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 = \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3n\u22c6r \u2248 20 for a photon travelling a distance r \u2248 1012 cm (comparable\nto the binary separation). VHE photons emitted close to the compact object are therefore always well inside the\n\u2018\u03b3-photosphere\u2019 at which \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 1. This initiates an e+e\u2212 pair cascade that redistributes the absorbed radiation to\nlower frequencies. Gamma-rays at energies below 100 GeV suffer little absorption because of the Wien cutoff of\nthe stellar spectrum. At higher energies the opacity decreases as 1\/E\u03b3 (23). The VHE spectrum may therefore be\n4\nhardened relative to its intrinsic shape.\nThe absorption of TeV photons in the system can be mitigated. First, the cross-section threshold and ampli-\ntude are angle-dependent, so that \u03b3-rays emitted in a cone pointing away from the companion are not absorbed.\nScattering of stellar photons in the wind will tend to isotropize the radiation and diminish this effect. Variations are\nexpected because the geometry changes with orbital phase. Second, \u03b3-ray emission need not take place close to\nthe compact object. Observations of X-ray emission from XRB jets provide evidence for acceleration of electrons\nto TeV energies on parsec scales (24). In LS 5039, acceleration at a shock >1 AU away from the stellar companion\nwould happen beyond the \u03b3-photosphere.\nThe association of LS 5039 with HESS J1826-148 confirms that like some AGN, XRB are able to accelerate\nparticles to at least TeV energies. Shocks from colliding ejecta or from jet - interstellar medium interactions are\nnatural candidates. Yet the association with an outflow may be questioned in the absence of a direct detection\nof relativistic motion in radio. The relativistic wind of a young pulsar is a conceivable alternative for particle\ninjection (25). The situation would then resemble that in PSR B1259-63, a system composed of a radio pulsar\nin a much wider 3.4 yr eccentric orbit around a Be star. TeV emission from PSR B1259-63 was detected with\nH.E.S.S. close to periastron (26). The higher wind density in LS 5039 probably smears out any radio pulses.\nThe resolved radio emission from LS 5039 would be due to particles (cascade pairs) streaming out of the system.\nFurther insights into this system may be gained from combined radio and \u03b3-ray observations: Very Long Baseline\nArray maps attain a spatial resolution of a few AU (6) tantalizingly close to the \u03b3-photosphere.\nReferences and Notes\n1.
