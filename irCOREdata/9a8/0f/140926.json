In depth\ninterviews were conducted with key personnel in a focal firm and two members of\nits supply chain and the results were analysed to identify emergent themes.\nFindings - The research has identified differences in supplier behaviour\ndependent on their role in PSS delivery and their relationship with the PSS\nprovider. In particular it suggests that for a successful partnership it is\nimportant to align the objectives between PSS provider and suppliers.\nOriginality\/ value - This research provides a detailed investigation into a PSS\nsupply chain and highlights the complexity of roles and relationships among the\norganisations within it. It will be of value to other PSS researchers and\norganisations transitioning to the delivery of PSS.

An example of this is the reduction in\ncontribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. In the period 1973-1997 the contribution of\nthe manufacturing sector in the UK went from 30% to 18%, 34% to 21% in Japan and 24% to\n16% in the USA (Department of Trade and Industry, 2002). In order to combat this,\nmanufacturing firms have moved away from seeking competitive advantage through process\nor product innovation (Dickson, 1992; Ghemawat, 1986) to \u2018servitizing\u2019, by integrating\nvalue-added services with their core offering (Davies et al., 2006; Slack et al.,\n2004;Vandermerwe and Rada, 1988). Thus, the offering moves from a product to a Product-\nService System or PSS (Baines et al., 2007; Baines et al., 2009; Spring and Araujo, 2009).\nProduct-Service Systems change the relationship between the manufacturer and the customer\nfrom a single point transaction in which the customer purchases a product from the\nmanufacturer, to an ongoing relationship in which the manufacturer continues to provide\nservices to the customer throughout the life of the PSS. There are well known examples of\nProduct Service Systems in both a business-to-business context (e.g. Xerox\u2019s document\nmanagement) and a business-to-consumer context (for example mobile telephone handsets\nsold with service contracts).\nThere has been extensive discussion in the academic literature about the business drivers for a\nsuccessful PSS. There is a commonly held view that the PSS model can offer a \u201cwin-win\u201d\nfor the supplier and the consumer of the PSS, potentially with an associated environmental\nbenefit (Mont, 2002; Tukker and Tischner, 2006). However, to date there has been little\nconsideration in the PSS literature of the effect on the upstream supply chain engaged in\n5delivering the PSS. It is this gap that we seek to address by exploring the differences\nbetween \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018PSS\u2019 supply chains using a case study in a supply network that\ndelivers both \u2018traditional\u2019 products and PSS. We do this in order to determine whether there\nare changes required in terms of the characteristics of the supply network and whether there\nwere counterintuitive behaviours.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 of the paper reviews the\nrelevant PSS literature with particular focus on the supply chain. In section 3 the research\nmethodology is presented, followed by the results in section 4. Section 5 provides a\ndiscussion of the research outcomes and conclusions are presented in section 7.\n2 Literature Review\n2.1 The Motivation for Offering Product-Service Systems\nThe distinction between products and services is limited as most offerings combine physical\nand non-physical elements (Shostack, 1982). Levitt (1981: p. 94) stated: \u201cEverybody sells\nintangibles in the marketplace, no matter what is produced in the factory\u201d, and more recently\nVargo and Lusch (2004) argued that physical products are only vehicles through which a\nservice is delivered. Thus, products have become order qualifiers - a necessity to play a part\nin the market - with services becoming order winners that can differentiate the product-\nservice package from the competition.\nVandermerwe and Rada (1988) propose that the move to servitization by an organisation\nallows deeper and longer engagement with their customers allowing greater opportunities.\nFurthermore, the provision of services through the life of the product also allows providers\nthe opportunity for further revenues through the provision of maintenance and service parts\n6(Cohen and Whang, 1997; Wise and Baumgartner, 1999) as service parts offer a higher-\nmargin than those used in production (Cohen et al., 2006). The potential benefits of\nservitization have been discussed by several authors and are summarised in Table 1.\nTable 1: Summary of the potential benefits of servitization.\nPe\nnt\ntin\nen\nan\nd\nPa\nlm\ner\n(2\n00\n7)\nO\nliv\na\nan\nd\nK\nal\nle\nnb\ner\ng\n(2\n00\n3)\nV\nan\nde\nrm\ner\nw\ne\n(2\n00\n0)\nD\nes\nm\net\net\nal\n.(\n19\n98\n)\nC\noh\nen\nan\nd\nW\nha\nng\n(1\n99\n7)\nV\nan\nde\nrm\ner\nw\ne\nan\nd\nR\nad\na\n(1\n98\n8)\nREVENUE ENHANCING BENEFITS\nProvides additional sources of revenue \uf0fc \uf0fc\nCreates more stable sources of revenue \uf0fc\nServices tend to have higher margins \uf0fc\nVALUE ENHANCING BENEFITS\nCustomers are demanding more services \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nAllows a better understanding of customer needs \uf0fc\nAllows establishing and maintaining\nrelationships with customers over the product\nlife-cycle\n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nAllows a more comprehensive solutions to\ncustomer needs\n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nImproves after-sales service \uf0fc \uf0fc\nProvides transparency of life-cycle costs for the\ncustomer\n\uf0fc\nSUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BENEFITS\nService is a differentiating factor (de-\ncommoditization)\n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nServices are more difficult to imitate \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nFacilitates customer lock-in \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nProduct-service packages can facilitate the\ndiffusion of innovations\n\uf0fc\nTable 1 indicates that the benefits of a company offering product-service systems can be\ngrouped into three categories:\n1. Revenue enhancing benefits which allow the firm to generate greater revenues over the\nlifecycle of the product-service system.\n72. Value enhancing benefits related to the delivery of a better value offering to the\nmarketplace leading to more satisfied customers.\n3. Enhancing both revenue and value lead to competitive advantage, however, the third\ncategory \u2013sustainable competitive advantage\u2013 groups the benefits that facilitate an\norganisation in maintaining competitiveness into the future.\n2.2 Supply Network Relationships in the context of PSS\nThe nature of the PSS offering dictates that it is mainly provided by organisations which\nsupply complex, long-life products that require through-life support (Voss, 2005). From the\nperspective of a network that supports the provision of PSS, the product is normally provided\nby one organisation, where services may be provided by members of their supply network\n(Cohen et al., 2006). The effective provision of PSS requires \u201cthe co-ordination of\nmanufacturing systems, maintenance, spare parts, logistics systems and so on\u201d (Slack et al.,\n2004: p. 384). Furthermore Slack et al. (2004) argue that the degree of integration between\norganisations should be similar to that of the products and services they provide. The reason\nfor this is that the complexity of the customer offering involves not only more organisational\nfunctions but also many more actors in the external network. It is also important that the\ninterests of all organizations in a supply network are aligned to maximise the performance of\nthe network; as Lee (2004: p. 110) observes, \u201cGreat companies take care to align the\ninterests of all the firms in their supply chain with their own. That's critical, because every\nfirm - be it a supplier, an assembler, a distributor, or a retailer - tries to maximize only its\nown interests\u201d.\nThe provision of PSS also commonly involves a transfer of risk from the customer to the\nsupplier; \u201cBy promising a result, the provider often faces difficulties in predicting and\n8controlling risks, uncertainties and responsibilities that otherwise were the problem of the\nuser\u201d (Tukker, 2004: p251). In a supply network context elements of assumed risk may be\nfurther transferred from the PSS provider to its suppliers. The challenges associated with this\nrisk transfer are more complex where there is a need to manage liabilities for potentially\nhazardous products and combat situations (Doerr et al., 2005; Snir, 2001; Stoughton and\nVotta, 2003).\nWe suggest that from a supply network perspective, two further particularities of PSS\nprovision are relevant for consideration: Firstly, the strategy of servitization is characterized\nwith increased levels of customer centricity (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003) and it encompasses\ntwo distinct elements when compared to manufacturing:\n1) A shift of the service offering from services performed on the product (i.e.\nproduct-oriented) to services performed for the user (i.e. user-oriented services),\nand:\n2) A shift in the nature of customer interaction from transaction to ongoing\nrelationship.\nSecondly, the content of exchange with product-service systems is considerably different to\nthat of a product. The presence of a service component (i.e. installation, maintenance,\ntraining) in an integrated offering is classified as tacit know-how assets by Teece (1986:\np.287). These are more easily employed through relational rather than transactional exchange\nbetween the members of the supply network (Helper and Levine, 1992; Zajac and Olsen,\n1993). Therefore we suggest that the most effective mechanism for facilitating supply\nnetworks that support the provision of PSS is through effective management of inter-\norganizational relationships (IORs).\n9Empirical studies on the strategic role of IORs (e.g. Anderson et al., 1994; Dyer and\nNobeoka, 2000; Liker and Choi, 2004), shows substantial benefits from the effective\nmanagement and building of cooperative relationships in supply networks. Relationships\nbetween firms provide a \u2018bridge\u2019 as they give one organization access to the resources of\nanother organization (Harland, 1996) and cooperative inter-firm relationships provide the\nfoundation for the successful management of materials and information flows across the\nsupply chain (Handfield and Nichols, 2002).\nWhilst there is a considerable body of academic knowledge on the role of upstream supply\nnetworks in the context of traditional manufacturing (e.g. pure product), there is less work in\nthe context of PSS. Johnson and Mena (2008) suggest that supply networks which support\nthe provision of product-service systems are different to those for the provision of products or\nservices. Their empirical work pointed to information flow management (i.e. sharing of\ninformation between supply chain members) which further affects customer and supplier\nrelationship processes as particularly important in the use of servitization strategies.\nThroughout the PSS and servitization literature there is a call for closer downstream\nrelationships at the interface between PSS provider and its customers (e.g. Davies et al.,\n2004; 2006; Vandermerwe et al., 1989; Wise and Baumgartner, 1999). Until recently, there\nhas been little that examined upstream relationships. Gulati and Kletter (2005), suggest there\nis also a need to rethink the ways companies manage their relationships on the upstream side\nof their supply networks. This is because acquiring partnering competences enables a\nsolutions provider to build alliances and partnerships with suppliers and deliver greater value\nto their customers.\n10\nThere are also negatives to a proposed move towards partnering with suppliers. This includes\nthe potential for the reduction in control over their suppliers due to \u2018knowledge leakage\u2019\nallowing suppliers to develop new capabilities (Cook et al., 2006; Rossetti and Choi, 2005;).\nMoreover, partnering can mean collaboration with potential competitors. The benefits of this\ncollaborative approach include the sharing of risk, provision of skills in the services area, an\ninnovative way to gain competitive advantage, and a means to moderate the political cost\ncaused by moving into the services area (Mathieu, 2001).\nThis literature review has identified that, to date, the main focus of PSS researchers has been\non the opportunities and barriers for companies wishing to develop and deliver a PSS. While\nthere is some work on the potential effects of the PSS on the supply chain and supply chain\nrelationships, the work remains mainly at a conceptual or exploratory level. Some of the\nempirical work shows that potential barriers to the development of PSS include unexpected\ncompetition between members of the supply network and concerns about knowledge leakage\nthrough the supply chain. While there is a clear thread of literature supporting the view on\nchanges required in managing supply chain relationships, these are mostly approached from\nthe PSS provider\u2019s \u2013 or downstream - perspective. The current state of the literature calls for\na more balanced approach and consideration of the upstream supply chain perspective. This is\nthe focus of our research.\n11\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Research Design\nResearch into the supply chain relationships in business networks that design, manufacture\nand support PSSs is immature, thus we adopted a case-based research methodology. Case-\nbased research is appropriate for exploratory and theory building research, suitable for\ndealing with \u2018how\u2019 type questions (Voss et al., 2002; Yin, 2003). The units of analysis for\nthe research were two relationships between a focal firm and two members of its supply chain\nwhere the focal firm designs, builds and delivers PSSs. The relationships were analysed as\npart of a nested case design (Patton, 2002, pp, 298-299). The questions to the focal firm were\nposed in a general way (i.e. their approach to the supply chain) whereas questions to the\nsuppliers were asked specifically (i.e. their approach to dealing with the focal firm).\nWe adopted a semi-grounded approach to data collection where we defined no a priori\nconstructs and themes in order to prevent us from introducing bias (L\u00e4nsisalmi et al., 2004).\nWe used an exploratory semi-structured interview protocol that focussed on determining how\nand why the case companies had begun to deliver servitized offerings and the challenges that\nthey were facing within their supply chain relationships. Copies of the protocol are available\nfrom the authors on request.\n3.1.1 Data collection and analysis\nData were collected between June and November 2007 at each of the case companies sites.\nThe interviews were conducted with key informants in each of the three case organisations by\n2 or 3 researchers from different disciplines (e.g. engineering, manufacturing, management)\nto reduce the potential of subject area bias. As perceptual frameworks are innate to individual\nresearchers (Meredith, 1998), the use of researchers from different disciplines allowed for\n12\ndifferent avenues of inquiry to be pursued in the data collection. Theoretical triangulation\n(Jick, 1979; Yin, 2003) was achieved through the collection of supplementary data such as\norganisation charts, process maps and operating protocols in addition to viewing the\noperations within the business units of the key informants.\nA total of 22 interviews were conducted with 16 informants and each of them lasted between\n1 to 3 hours, which yielded more than 200,000 words of verbatim transcripts. Data was\nanalysed using an inductive research approach (Cassel and Symon, 1990). An analytical\nreflection of the data was carried out by the emergent identification of patterns (Cassel and\nSymon, 1990; Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Yin, 2003). To identify the effects that the adoption\nof PSS had on supply chain relationships an open coding method - a process of data\ndisaggregation into conceptual categories - was carried out to identify patterns in the data.\nAccording to Miles and Huberman (1994), codes are tags or labels for assigning units of\nmeaning to the descriptive or inferential information compiled during a study. For the\npurposes of coding and arranging data we used the mapping software (Mind Manager\uf0d4). To\nstrengthen the reliability of our findings, the coding was performed by a multidisciplinary\nteam of researchers (Miles and Huberman, 1994; Yin, 2003).\n3.2 Sample frame and description of case organisations\nIn order to investigate the differences in relationships that occur between the provision of a\nproduct and a PSS offering we examined two upstream relationship dyads to a focal firm.\nFigure 1 details the structure of the supply chain and the size, turnover, role and business\nmodel within the relationship. The identities of the case firms have not been shown to\npreserve anonymity.\n13\n< Figure 1 >\nThe focal firm is a UK manufacturer producing complex engineered products in a business to\nbusiness context. In the past they worked to a traditional manufacturing model and sold\nproducts to their customers, who then took responsibility for the products\u2019 maintenance and\nrepair throughout their lifespan. In recent years the focal firm have developed PSS offerings\nfor some of their product lines. In the PSS model the focal firm sells their products with an\nongoing package of services, providing maintenance, monitoring and repair services\nthroughout the products\u2019 lifecycle.\nThe system supplier is a supplier of sub-systems, spares and maintenance to the focal firm\nand other maintenance organisations. The system supplier has joined a risk sharing\npartnership with the focal firm for the delivery of their PSS offerings. The repair service\nsupplier is a medium-sized company that provides repair services for high value components\nin the focal firm\u2019s products. It is a joint venture between the focal firm and another firm.\nTable 2 provides details of the participants interviewed in the research, including an identifier\nto link any discourse in the results section back to the informant.\nTable 2: Key informants interviewed for the research.\nCase company Respondents Identifier\nManuCo (Focal firm) - Service Operations Director\n- Repair Engineering Manager\n- Services Marketing Director\n- Operations Centre Manager\n- Services Executive\n- Supply Chain Manager\n- Human Resource Manager\n- Services Innovation Manager\n- Customer Services Manager\n- Project Manager\nFF 1\nFF 2\nFF 3\nFF 4\nFF 5\nFF 6\nFF 7\nFF 8\nFF 9\nFF 10\nRepairCo (Repair Service Supplier) - Managing Director\n- Commercial Director\n- Operations Manager\nRSS 1\nRSS 2\nRSS 3\nSysCo (System Supplier) - Commercial Director SS 1\n14\n- Sales and Contracts Manager\n- Production Manager\nSS 2\nSS 3\nThe remainder of this paper reviews the results of the case interviews, and discusses the\nresults in the context of the PSS literature.\n4 Results\nThe results are presented in two sections. Firstly the relationships and information flows for\nthe studied organisations are discussed; then the case results are reviewed and classified using\nthe themes that emerged from the data.\n4.1 Structure of Supply Chain Relationships\nBefore presenting the detailed case analysis it is useful to understand the interactions between\nthe companies for the studied PSS. The information and data flows involved in delivering the\nproduct and service offering have been represented graphically using system organisation\nmaps as proposed by Manzini et al. (2004). The traditional manufacturing model used prior\nto offering the PSS is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that in this scenario ManuCo may\noften interact with a customer only at the point of purchase and does not necessarily have any\nongoing relationship with the customer. Once the product has been purchased the customer\u2019s\nmain relationship is with the maintenance centre which coordinates the provision of spare\nparts and repairs from ManuCo, SysCo and RepairCo for the customer.\n<Figure 2>\nFigure 3 presents the changed relationships for the provision of the PSS offering. In the new\nmodel ManuCo, as the PSS Provider, has an ongoing relationship with the customer: starting\nfrom the order of the PSS, and continuing through the provision of ongoing maintenance and\n15\nrepair throughout the life of the PSS. ManuCo also takes on a central role communicating\nwith suppliers. In this scenario the previously independent maintenance organisation is now\npart of ManuCo. Furthermore ManuCo and SysCo have joined a risk sharing partnership for\nthe provision of the PSS offering. RepairCo is a joint venture between ManuCo and one of\ntheir major suppliers.\n<Figure 3>\nThe process flows shown in Figures 2 and 3 highlight significant differences in the roles of\nthe organisations in the provision of a PSS compared to a traditional product. In the PSS\nmodel ManuCo provides a central role for the whole PSS lifecycle, whereas previously the\nproduct support was led by a separate maintenance organisation. The following sections will\ninvestigate in detail the effects of these changed relationships on the PSS provider and supply\nchain.\n4.2 Case Study Results\nThis section presents the case study results in the context of PSS and supply chain\nrelationships. The patterns that inductively emerged from the data have been grouped in five\nthemes. These are summarized in Table 3 and are: 1. Supplier engagement in PSS strategy\nand delivery; 2. Alignment of incentives between PSS provider and suppliers; 3. The effect of\nPSS on planned business developments; 4. Information sharing in PSS delivery and 5.\nOverall lifecycle considerations related to PSS delivery.\n16\nTable 3.

The level of supplier engagement was found to be\nmarkedly different for the two suppliers RepairCo and SysCo.\nRepairCo reported that they have no involvement in the PSS strategy definition or delivery\nand stated that they saw no real changes for their company due to the PSS model. RepairCo\nreceives repair orders and payments on the same basis for both PSS contracted repairs and\nstandard contracted repairs. A RepairCo respondent reported:\n\u201cif we see a product in here whether it\u2019s from a [PSS] or [traditional] agreement, there\u2019s no\ndifference\u201d. [RSS2]\nIn fact the most significant change reported by RepairCo was that they have seen an overall\nreduction in their business with ManuCo as a result of ManuCo\u2019s move towards offering\nPSS. This was reported as being due to ManuCo fitting new \u2013 rather than repaired -\ncomponents at each service. RepairCo\u2019s formation as a joint venture between ManuCo and\none of ManuCo\u2019s major suppliers does not seem to have resulted in a closer relationship\nbetween the two companies. A RepairCo respondent highlighted the conflicting incentives\nfaced by RepairCo:\n\u201c[ManuCo] want [RepairCo] to give cost reductions. The Board of Directors want us to make\nmore profit and 50% of those Board of Directors are from [ManuCo]. So what do they\nwant?\u201d [RSS2]\nSysCo described a much closer engagement in the PSS delivery through their risk sharing\npartnership with ManuCo. A SysCo Manager reported:\n18\n\u201cwe had a share of [ManuCo\u2019s PSS Offering] and depending on how successful that was in\nthe market place we both would reap the rewards in the long-term\u201d. [SS1]\nSysCo had made significant up-front investment in supporting the design and development of\nthe PSS and recognised that they had the opportunity to profit from its success. SysCo did\nidentify some risks associated with their involvement in the PSS. Firstly, their dependence\non ManuCo to recruit sufficient customers to achieve a return on their investment and\nsecondly the uncertain cost of raw materials, which meant that their expenditure could change\nsignificantly after the pricing of the PSS has been agreed. The risk sharing partnership\nbetween SysCo and ManuCo has engendered a spirit of collaboration that was not observed\nin the RepairCo\/ ManuCo relationship.\nManuCo\u2019s Service Operations Director acknowledged ManuCo\u2019s dependence on their supply\nchain to help successfully deliver their PSS offering. He highlighted a number of risks\nassociated with these relationships including a fear of being locked-in to a particular\ncomponent or system developed by a supplier. The risks included the potential exposure to\nhigh component costs in the aftermarket and dependence on a poorly performing supplier\nwho could not be replaced due to the lack of an appropriate alternative because of the\nretention of Intellectual Property by the supplier.\n4.2.2 Alignment of Incentives between PSS Provider and suppliers\nThis theme refers to the degree of alignment between the companies engaged in offering the\nPSS. Interviewees from all three companies made a substantial number of comments in this\narea. ManuCo reported that they saw benefits in developing relationships that result in\naligned incentives with their suppliers. A ManuCo senior manager commented:\n19\n\u201c\u2026there\u2019s an intent to try and get to partner with our suppliers on a win\/win basis\u201d [FF6]\nHe went on to acknowledge that this had not happened enough to date. One example of\nsuccessful alignment described by ManuCo is of another supplier which now provides\nsystems to ManuCo on a PSS basis. This arrangement is beneficial to ManuCo due to the\nincentive for the supplier to increase the reliability of their systems and also because of the\ntransfer of risk to the supplier:\n\u201cit\u2019s incentivising them to make [their products] more reliable.\u201d [FF8]\nBoth ManuCo and SysCo reported that a key achievement of their risk sharing partnership\nwas improved alignment of incentives for the two companies. A SysCo respondent\ncommented:\n\u201cone of the key aspects to this was to align the two business models \u2026 and improve service\nlevel, reduce costs, improve bottom line for both businesses\u201d. [SS2]\nSysCo respondents also observed that by better aligning their business models they have\njointly improved service levels and reduced costs. One SysCo interviewee highlighted the\nclosely aligned views between ManuCo and SysCo commenting that:\n\u201cToday it\u2019s much more in our interest to stop the unit coming back in the first place and\nmaking it more reliable\u201d. [SS1]\n20\nThis illustrates the change of incentives for his company to prioritise reliability rather than\nviewing spares and repairs as a potential income stream.\nConversely RepairCo reported a lack of alignment between their business and that of\nManuCo. One specific example cited by RepairCo was ManuCo\u2019s policy on whether to\nreplace or repair worn and damaged components in their products. RepairCo\u2019s business\nmodel is sensitive to ManuCo\u2019s policy on whether to replace or repair worn components,\nwhich changes under the PSS model and RepairCo is concerned that this could lead to a\nreduction in business for RepairCo. Repair Co\u2019s Commercial Director stated:\n\u201cthey want to sell new parts, we want to overhaul parts\u201d [RSS2]\nRepairCo did identify one benefit of the PSS model for RepairCo which was the stability and\ncontractual agreements with ManuCo\u2019s PSS customers which allowed them to build up a\npool of repaired components that could be used to provide much faster repair turnaround\ntimes for these customers. Overall, RepairCo had made a significant investment in a pool of\nspare components and saw this as a benefit in the reduced turnaround time for the repair of\nparts for ManuCo\u2019s PSS customers.\n4.2.3 The Effect of PSS on Planned Business Developments\nThe theme of planned business developments refers to the organisations\u2019 future plans for\ndeveloping their own business, whether related to the PSS or not. The planned business\ndevelopments of the two suppliers reflected their differing views of the benefits of PSS to\ntheir organisations.\n21\nRepairCo perceived that the PSS model had a limited impact on their company, except due to\nthe overall reduction in business from ManuCo. One of their employees commented:\n\u201cOver the past 2 years we have reduced [our level of business with ManuCo] by 10% and\nwe\u2019ve got plans to reduce it even further\u201d. [RSS1]\nTheir focus for the future was on expanding their customer base for repair services, which\nmeant identifying new customers, and reducing their dependence on ManuCo for business.\nThey also stated objectives to expand their services from offering only component repairs to\nmanaging the repair of systems:\n\u201cour strategy is to be more of an integrator\u201d [RSS2]\nThis highlights a desire to expand their capabilities and move \u2018up the value chain\u2019. RepairCo\ndid not believe that developing their own PSS would be part of their future strategy.\nSysCo identified potential business developments within the PSS area. SysCo were focussed\non continuing and developing their participation in ManuCo\u2019s PSS but also saw business\nopportunities to sell their own products as a PSS and had started to develop capabilities in\nthis area. SysCo also saw benefits in developing risk sharing partnerships with its own\nsuppliers, but recognised that it would be difficult for smaller suppliers to take on the risks\nassociated with this, stating:\n\u201csome of the smaller suppliers they just can\u2019t take on those sort of size of risks\u201d. [SS1]\n22\nSysCo respondents also reported a potential risk that developing their own PSS offerings\ncould put them in direct competition with ManuCo.\n4.2.4 Information Sharing in PSS Delivery\nInformation sharing refers to the exchange of information between the PSS provider and their\nsuppliers, encompassing the types of information that are exchanged and the effect of this\ninformation sharing on their business.\nManuCo reported that they believed that there was currently not enough information sharing\ninside their organisation. For example they cited the need to improve mechanisms to capture\nfeedback relating to common component failure types back to design.\n\u201cThere\u2019s virtually no feedback whatsoever from the [maintenance centre] that tells the guys\nwho manufacture the part\u2026 what the [part] looks like after it\u2019s been [used] \u201d [FF2]\nManuCo also highlighted a concern relating to information sharing with the supply chain and\na concern that although suppliers need more insights in ManuCo business they were currently\nnot providing more business relevant information to the upstream supply chain.\n\u201cThe straight answer is no! We do not convey data from condition monitoring upstream to\nour suppliers. I did not come across the situation that we would trigger spares or repair\nrequirements from a data captured during product\u2019s operation.\u201d (FF6)\nRepairCo reported that in order to play an effective role in supporting ManuCo in the\nprovision of PSS they will have to have much greater insight into ManuCo\u2019s strategic as well\n23\nas operational decisions. However the mindset of more open information sharing with\nupstream suppliers is still rather the exception than the rule in ManuCo. This asymmetrical\ntransparency is problematic for suppliers because they cannot effectively plan for future\nchanges in demand from ManuCo.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t receive any forward planning or strategy of roles going to their market place and\ntrying to win more customer business into [the PSS offering] . We read it in the newspaper.\u201d\n(RSS1).\n\u201cFor me, I think where we don\u2019t get a view of and I think it would be important the bigger\nview around [ManuCo\u2019s] relationship with key customers, which at our level we don\u2019t see. So\nwe don\u2019t know what the key customers are pushing back and saying to [ManuCo], you know,\nthese are the real concerns, so we don\u2019t have the opportunity to say, well we can help you\nwith some of those concerns, you know, we are almost taken away from that party.\u201d(RSS2)\nSysCo are more closely involved in the overall PSS delivery, but also highlighted a number\nof opportunities for improved information sharing which could streamline their partnership\nwith ManuCo and remove duplication. A SysCo interviewee expressed frustration that\nManuCo were sometimes not open to proposals from SysCo to work together and increase\nefficiencies.\n\u201cIf they would provide us more information on their sustaining engineering bills, their\nmodification bills, that would enable us to manage the risk. We would still face the problem\n24\nbut we could manage it, we could be more proactive than reactive than when we get faced\nwith the bill.\u201d (SS3)\n4.2.5 Overall Lifecycle Considerations Related to PSS Delivery\nThe lifecycle considerations relate to how well the companies are able to understand the\ncomplete lifecycle of the PSS and issues associated with evaluating costs\/ risks across the\nlifecycle. ManuCo explained that by moving to the PSS model they have had to make a major\nshift in their organisation from a manufacturing mindset to whole lifecycle view. The\nService Operations Director commented:\n\u201cnow our business model\u2019s changed; we make it once but we repair it four or five times\u201d.\n[FF1]\nManuCo now experience maintenance as a cost to their own company instead of a cost to\ntheir customer and this has significantly changed their view of maintenance management.\nOne example of the difficulty of achieving this lifecycle view is the need to trade-off the cost\nof replacing worn components against the cost of repairing them; taking into account the full\nlifecycle costs including the value of the raw materials and the time taken to repair. Two\nManuCo interviewees presented differing views on whether it was more cost effective to\nreplace or repair worn components. The view from Manufacturing Operations was:\n\u201cwe\u2019ll manage them by fitting new parts: it costs cheaper\u201d, [FF2]\nWhereas the Service Operations view was that:\n25\n\u201cworld economics force you to think differently and [with] a large [component], you are not\ngoing to throw [it] away with the amount of material value\u201d. [FF1]\nRepairCo respondents also presented views on ManuCo\u2019s decisions about whether to replace\nor repair worn components. Their major concern is that they believe ManuCo\u2019s decisions on\nwhether to replace or repair worn components are being made on the basis of a limited\nevaluation of the whole lifecycle costs. RepairCo\u2019s Operations Manager stated:\n\u201c[ManuCo] are throwing away material that\u2019s repairable\u201d [RSS3]\nRepairCo believes that ManuCo are not incorporating all of their internal costs into the\nlifecycle cost analysis which means that some repairs could be viewed as less competitive\nthan they actually are.\nSysCo respondents also believed that ManuCo has difficulties in measuring the entire\nlifecycle costs of the PSS. In particular they commented that it would have been very\ndifficult to fully understand the lifecycle cost of the PSS at the time the contract was\nnegotiated and that this could expose them to future risk if the initial estimates prove to be\ninaccurate.\n5 Discussion\nThis paper has presented a detailed investigation into the delivery of a Product Service\nSystem by a large manufacturer and two of its suppliers. Whilst it is difficult to generalise\nfrom a single case, the results have identified some interesting characteristics of network\nrelationships which provide an increased understanding of the delivery of a large, complex\n26\nPSS by a supply chain and will help to inform future research. The discussion is presented in\nthree sections: the first section provides a review of the results in the context of the PSS\nliterature, then the following two sections provide a more detailed discussion of the two\nstrongest themes from the case results: the need for incentive alignment and effective\ninformation sharing in PSS supply networks.\n5.1 Comparison of Research Findings with PSS Literature\ni. PSS is \u201can excellent vehicle to enhance competitiveness\u201d (Tukker, 2004: P246). Our\nresults have shown that the proclaimed benefit of PSS to enhance competitiveness\nmay not be necessarily achieved by companies in the PSS supply chain. The case\nresults show markedly different attitudes to the Product Service Systems model\nbetween the two suppliers that were studied. It is clear that SysCo (which has a risk\nsharing partnership with the PSS provider) has much greater investment in, and\nsupport for, the PSS than RepairCo which is not a partner in the PSS. Even though\nRepairCo is a ManuCo joint venture company it has seen very limited benefits from\nthe PSS business model, and in some respects it has had a negative impact on their\nbusiness and led them to expand their business in other areas.\nii. PSS can help \u201cpromote sustainable patterns of consumption\u201d (Mont, 2002: p. 240).\nIn our research we found that the PSS business model had actually reduced the\nnumber of repairs performed during the product\u2019s lifecycle and encouraged a policy to\nfit new components, even though this is a less sustainable solution. This is contrary to\nthe expected environmental benefits of PSS, and highlights the difficulty of achieving\na whole lifecycle view of a PSS across a supply chain. It would be interesting to\nundertake a more detailed investigation into this outcome to determine whether this is\nan isolated instance, or whether a similar pattern is seen in other large, complex, PSS.\n27\niii. PSS can \u201cimprove relationships with consumers because of increased contact and\nflow of information about consumers\u2019 preferences\u201d (Mont, 2002: p 240). Whilst\nrelationships with the consumer may be improved by PSS, relationships and\ninformation flow are not necessarily improved with the upstream supply chain. All of\nthe respondents recognised the importance of sharing information through the supply\nchain, and both suppliers expressed frustration at their lack of input into the PSS\nprovider\u2019s strategy. ManuCo\u2019s reluctance to share information with the supply chain\nmay be in part due to their concern that the intellectual capital for their PSS is being\ndistributed through the supply chain. This is in accord with Cook, Bhamra and\nLemon\u2019s (2006) findings that organisations may be reluctant to outsource services due\nto the risk of knowledge leakage to third parties. ManuCo also identified a related risk\nthat they may become locked-in to particular suppliers, even if those suppliers do not\nperform well.\niv. \u201cA manufacturing company [implementing a service strategy] should consider the\ncollaborative option, meaning forming partnerships with potential competitors\u201d\n(Matthieu, 2001: P466). The case study identified that there is increased complexity\nin customer and supplier relationships due to the PSS model. In the studied case the\nPSS provider had a mix of PSS and traditional customers, and some of their\ncustomers purchased a mix of PSS and traditional offerings. Furthermore, one of the\nPSS suppliers acts as a PSS provider for their own PSS offerings, sometimes selling\nto the same customers as the PSS provider. Our findings are in alignment with\nMathieu\u2019s view that service providers can benefit from partnering with potential\ncompetitors, but will also need to manage the risk of finding themselves in direct\ncompetition with their partner. For any PSS delivered by a large supply chain this\ncomplexity in customer relationships will be a challenge for the future.\n28\nv. \u201cProduct pooling\u201d Tukker (2004: P. 249) is proposed as an archetypal PSS business\nmodel. In our case study both suppliers have invested in a pool of repaired\ncomponents that can be supplied to any PSS customer and reduces the turnaround\ntime for repairs. Even though RepairCo is not contracted to supply services to\nManuCo on a PSS basis, they have still benefited from the PSS business model in this\nregard. This benefit has been achieved due to the ongoing contractual relationship\nbetween the PSS provider and its customers (in which the customers agree to accept\ncomponents from a repaired pool), and perhaps also due to the increased stability in\nthe demand for repair services achieved through implementing a PSS business model.\nThe two strongest themes identified through the case study were the need for incentive\nalignment between a PSS provider and their supply network and the need for information\nsharing through the network. These topics are discussed in more detail in the following\nsections.\n5.2 The Need for Alignment of Incentives across the Supply Network\nThe need for incentive alignment provides a strong theme throughout the case data. PSS is\nnot unique in this regard, and it is clear that there is a need for companies to align their\nincentives in all supply chains (Lee, 2004). However, the alignment of incentives is more\nchallenging in a PSS environment, because the supplier takes on risk from the customer and\nmay wish to further transfer some risk to its own supply chain. ManuCo has successfully\nachieved incentives alignment with SysCo through their shared investment and profit from\nthe PSS. However, despite RepairCo being part owned by ManuCo, there is only limited\nincentive for them to invest in, and reap the rewards of the PSS. In fact there is a conflict of\n29\ninterest between RepairCo\u2019s desire to undertake more repairs, and ManuCo\u2019s policy to fit\nnew components.\nThe observation that RepairCo did not realise an increase in business due to the adoption of\nthe new business model indicates that ManuCo had made decisions without consulting their\nsupplier. By fitting new components ManuCo ensured that the asset was always returned to\nan \u2018as new\u2019 condition. Moreover, ManuCo ensured the ongoing utilisation of capacity at its\nown manufacturing facilities. This choice also impacted the profitability of the offering\nbecause new components were more expensive than refurbished and potentially had an\nimpact on the success of RepairCo, a joint-venture organization. There would also be the\nenvironmental impact of discarding components that were repairable. If the incentives had\nbeen aligned with members of the supply chain from the outset then these trade-offs would\nhave been avoided. The need to align incentives across the supply network can be seen as an\nextension of Stoughton and Votta\u2019s (2003) conclusion that the incentives of the PSS provider\nand customer must be aligned for a successful PSS.\n5.3 The Need for Effective Information Sharing\nWhilst ManuCo changed their attitudes, behaviours and information sharing routines on the\ncustomer-facing side of the organization, the change on the supplier-facing side was rather\nlimited. This was manifested in ongoing tensions between ManuCo and its two suppliers as a\nresult of a mismatch between expected and actual levels of information exchange. Both\nsuppliers perceived an increase in levels of information exchange as a necessary condition to\neffectively support ManuCo\u2019s PSS offering. This observation corroborates the link between\nthe adoption of PSS business models and the need for more intensive information exchange\nbetween key members of the supply chain. For example, Johnson and Mena (2008) and\nWuyts et al. (2004), all showed that in technology and knowledge intensive environments\n30\nhigher levels of information exchange are required for effective support of complex\nintegrated offering.\nThe adoption of the PSS model will not only require changes in levels of exchanged\ninformation, but also in the nature of relationships between the actors in the network.\nInformation sharing and the relationship nature, however, are part of a mutually reinforcing\ncircle. Namely, closer and more collaborative relationships will likely involve higher levels\nof information exchange, and higher levels of information exchange will breed more\ncollaborative relationships (Hakanson, 1982, Anderson and Weitz, 1992). The evidence from\nthe case companies showed that the nature of relationships between ManuCo and its two\nsuppliers did not really change. As relationships stayed largely unchanged so did the\ninformation sharing routines. For example, both suppliers were concerned about the lack of\ninformation sharing from ManuCo in order to understand and consequently respond to\nManuCo\u2019s operational and strategic decisions that directly impacted their business.\nManuCo should recognize three things. Firstly, that if they require suppliers to support their\nPSS offering they should enable them to have the access to relevant information. Secondly,\nthat higher levels of information exchange will necessitate changes in the nature of\nrelationships between supply chain actors. Thirdly, and finally, that information exchange\nand the nature of the relationship (i.e. arms-length or partnership) are mutually reinforcing.\nAs Helper and Levine (1992) and Zajac and Olsen (1993) suggest, the exchange of services\nrelated information (i.e. know-how) is more easily employed through partnering type\nrelationships characterised by trust, commitment and mutual adaptations. This is because\ninformation needs to be effectively exchanged between parties.\n31\n6 Conclusions\nThis research has undertaken a detailed investigation into a supply network delivering a\ncomplex PSS and provides a foundation for future research into PSS supply networks. The\nkey conclusions drawn from the research are:\n(1) The proposed benefits of PSS are not necessarily achieved by the extended supply\nnetwork. Our results have shown that the adoption of a PSS business model can have a\nnegative effect on companies in the supply chain if the suppliers are not well integrated into\nthe PSS delivery. Customer\/ supplier relationships in supply chains delivering PSS may\nbecome extremely complicated, with companies playing multiple roles in the supply network.\n(2) The alignment of incentives between a PSS provider and its suppliers is important for a\nsuccessful PSS but can be difficult to achieve due to the differing objectives of each\ncompany. Furthermore, the transfer of risk in PSS delivery makes incentive alignment more\ndifficult to achieve than in a traditional supply chain. In our case study we found it was not\nsufficient for the PSS provider to develop a formal relationship with a supplier for the\ndelivery of PSS, they also needed to align the profit incentive between them to achieve a\nsuccessful partnership.\n(3) Effective information sharing across the PSS supply network is essential for a profitable\nand sustainable PSS, but this can be very difficult to achieve in practice, particularly if the\nPSS provider is concerned about knowledge leakage into the supply chain.\n7 Acknowledgements\nThis research was funded by the Cranfield Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre\n(EPSRC Grant EP\/E001874\/1).
