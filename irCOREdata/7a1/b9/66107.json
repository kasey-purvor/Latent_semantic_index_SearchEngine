The standard model fields are assumed\nto be confined to a hyper-surface (or 3-brane) embedded in this higher dimensional space, in\ncontrast to the gravitational fields which propagate through the whole of spacetime [1\u201310].\nIn order for this to be a phenomenologically relevant model of our universe, standard four-\ndimensional gravity must be recovered on our brane. There are various ways to do this,\nthe most obvious being to assume that the extra dimensions transverse to our brane are\ncompact. In this case gravity can be recovered on scales larger than the size of the extra\ndimensions [5\u20137]. This is different from earlier proposals since the restrictions on the size\nof the extra dimensions from particle physics experiments no longer apply, as the standard\nmodel fields are confined to the brane. The extra dimensions only have to be smaller\nthan the scale on which gravity experiments have probed, of order 0.1mm at the time of\nwriting. Another way to recover four-dimensional gravity at large distances is to embed a\npositive tension 3-brane into an AdS5 bulk [9,10]. In this scenario four-dimensional gravity\nis obtained at scales larger than the AdS radius. Randall and Sundrum showed that this\ncould produce sensible gravity even if the extra dimension was not compact.\nSeveral interesting aspects of the above extra dimensional scenarios have since been\ninvestigated, and compared with the standard four-dimensional case. The cosmology of a 3-\nbrane in a five-dimensional bulk was studied and its Friedmann equation derived and shown\nto contain several extra terms [11\u201315]. Perturbations to this homogeneous case have been\nexamined [16\u201319] as have some inflationary models [20,21], as well as alternative solutions\nto the flatness and horizon problems [22]. The behaviour of phase transitions, topological\ndefects and baryogenesis in a brane world setting were also considered [23]. More recently\nit was shown how to embed the Randall-Sundrum models within supergravities [24\u201326]\nand then within string theory compactifications as in [27\u201330]. The seemingly arbitrary\nfeature of having an AdS bulk spacetime is actually well motivated as it is found as a\nsupersymmetric vacuum to supergravity theories, inspiring several more recent brane world\nmodels [31\u201337]. For recent, comprehensive reviews of the subject see [38, 39].\nThe extra term C\/r4, in the Friedmann equation known as the dark radiation term,\ncould provide a possible test for the above extra-dimensional scenarios. Although many\nauthors have assumed that C is constant, this will not be the case if the brane emits\ngravitons at early times. The evolution of C has been studied [40\u201342] for symmetric branes.\nHowever, in this paper we examine the dynamics of a non-Z2 symmetric graviton emitting\nbrane [43] and determine what consequences the lack of symmetry has on the evolution of\nC. We begin in section 2 by summarising the main aspects of non-Z2 branes, including the\nnew Friedmann equation and the global nature of the five-dimensional spacetimes either\nside of the brane. Then in section 3 we derive the equations that govern the evolution of\nthe energy density \u03c1, the dark radiation parameter C and the non-Z2 symmetric parameter\nF , using a Vaidya spacetime approximation. The global nature of these five-dimensional\n(AdS)-Vaidya spacetimes is then discussed along with the appropriate conformal diagrams.\nWe then analytically solve the system of equations in the high\/low energy limits in section 4,\n2\nbefore presenting a full numerical treatment in section 5. We examine the full range of\ninitial conditions for C and F , and include several interesting cases that have so far been\nignored. Constraints on the size of the initial dark radiation and non-Z2 symmetric terms\nin this scenario are derived and are notably independent of M5, the five dimensional Plank\nmass. Our conclusions are given in section 6.\n2 Non-Z2 Symmetric Branes Moving Through Five-\ndimensional Spacetimes\nIn this section we summarise the relevant aspects of a non-Z2 brane in an AdS bulk. We\ndiscuss the derivation of the non-Z2 Friedmann equation and also the global nature of the\nfive-dimensional Schwarzschild-Anti-deSitter spacetime.\n2.1 The Non-Z2 Symmetric Friedmann Equation\nStarting with the five-dimensional Einstein equations,\nGAB + \u039bgAB = \u03ba\n2TAB, (1)\nwhere \u03ba is related to the fundamental five-dimensional Plank mass M5 by \u03ba = 1\/M\n3\n5 , one\ncan use Birkhoff\u2019s theorem to show that the bulk metric must take the form,\nds2 = \u2212f\u00b1(r)dT 2 + r2d\u03a32k +\n1\nf\u00b1(r)\ndr2. (2)\nHere d\u03a32k represents the maximally symmetric three-dimensional metric with k = \u22121, 0, 1\nparameterising the spatial curvature. The \u00b1 in equation 2 represents the fact that the\nbulk spacetime can be different either side of the brane. The function f\u00b1(r) is found by\nsubstituting the metric (2) into the Einstein equations (1) and is given by [15],\nf\u00b1(r) = \u00b52r2 + k \u2212 C\n\u00b1\nr2\n. (3)\n\u00b5 is the inverse curvature radius, related to the five-dimensional cosmological constant by\n\u00b5 =\n\u221a\u2212\u039b\/6, and C\u00b1 is the bulk black hole mass parameter to the right\/left of the brane\nrespectively. We see that the bulk solution on either side of the brane can be either an\nAdS black hole (C\u00b1 > 0), an AdS naked singularity (C\u00b1 < 0) or pure AdS (C\u00b1 = 0).\nIf a brane with stress-energy-momentum tensor TAB = \u03b4(r)diag(\u2212\u03c1\u02c6 \u2212 \u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212 \u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212\n\u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212 \u03c3, 0) exists between two such spacetimes, the Israel junction conditions [44\u201347] can\nbe used to show that the Friedmann equation governing the expansion of the brane is given\nby [48],\nH\u02c62 \u2261\n(\nr\u02d9\nr\n)2\n=\n\u03ba4\u03c3\n18\n\u03c1\u02c6 +\n\u03ba4\n36\n\u03c1\u02c62 \u2212 k\nr2\n+\n\u00b52C\nr4\n+\n\u00b52\u03c32F 2\n(\u03c1\u02c6+ \u03c3)2r8\n. (4)\n3\nHere \u03c3 is the bare brane tension, \u03c1 is the physical energy density of the brane, and we have\nimposed the Randall-Sundrum tuning conditions such that \u03ba4\u03c32\/36 + \u039b\/6 = 0, and hence\nthat \u03ba4\u03c32\/36 = \u00b52. The Weyl (or dark radiation) parameter C and the non-Z2 parameter\nF are dimensionless, and are related to the average and difference of the black hole masses\neither side of the brane via,\nC = C\n+ + C\u2212\n2\u00b52\n, F =\nC+ \u2212 C\u2212\n4\u00b52\n. (5)\nThe implications of the extra terms in the Friedmann equation (4) have been thoroughly\ninvestigated [11,12,48,49]. However, as will be discussed in the following section, if gravi-\ntons are emitted by the brane into the bulk at early times then the parameters C and F will\nno longer be constant and the early cosmological evolution of the brane could be greatly\naffected. Note that there is an alternative method of breaking the Z2 symmetry across\nthe brane; one can have different cosmological constants either side of the brane leading\nto a term \u221d 1\/r6 in the Friedmann equation. Although interesting, this type of non-Z2\nsymmetry is not directly affected by graviton emission and so will not be considered here.\n2.2 Global Structure of Sch-AdS\nHere we summarise some aspects of the global structure of the aforementioned Sch-AdS\nspacetime and the brane\u2019s trajectory through it. For clarity we refer only to the spacetime\non the right hand side of the brane, which has black hole mass C+. Such concepts will be\nof use when in the next section we generalise the analysis to Vaidya spacetimes. In what\nfollows, we assume the case where k = 0 and C+ is positive. Other cases can be argued\nsimilarly.\nOne should note that the coordinates T and r in equations (2) and (3) do not cover the\nwhole of the Sch-AdS spacetime, and are valid only for r > rh = (C+)1\/4\/\u00b51\/2. To continue\nbeyond this horizon we first note that the metric given by equation (2) is conformally\nequivalent (after rescaling) to,\nds2 = \u2212\n(\nr4 \u2212 1\nr2\n)\ndT 2 +\n(\nr2\nr4 \u2212 1\n)\ndr2 + r2d\u03a320, (6)\nwhere the horizon is now at r = 1. We then map the radial coordinate from 1 < r <\u221e to\n\u2212\u221e < R < \u03c0\/4 according to the transformation,\nR =\n\u222b\nr2dr\nr4 \u2212 1 =\n1\n2\ntan\u22121(r) +\n1\n4\nlog\n[\nr \u2212 1\nr + 1\n]\n. (7)\nThen after changing to the null coordinates given by u = t\u2212 R and v = t+ R the metric\nlooks like,\nds2 = \u2212\n(\nr4 \u2212 1\nr2\n)\ndudv + r2d\u03a320. (8)\n4\nFinally changing to the coordinates U and V given by,\nU = \u2212 exp(\u22122u), (9)\nV = exp(2v), (10)\nresults in the metric,\nds2 = \u2212\n(\nr4 \u2212 1\nr2\n)(\ndUdV\n\u22124UV\n)\n+ r2d\u03a320. (11)\nNote that the point (1, 0) in the (r, t) plane has now been mapped onto (0, 0) in the (U, V )\nplane and hence that the future and past horizons at r = 1 of the black hole have been\nmapped onto the positive V and negative U axes respectively. To see that the zero at r = 1\nhas been removed note that,\nUV = \u2212\n(\nr \u2212 1\nr + 1\n)\nexp[2 tan\u22121(r)], (12)\nwhich behaves as (r \u2212 1) for r \u2248 1. Using the above coordinate transformation one can\nr\n=\n\u221e\nr = 0\nr = 0\nr = r(t)\nEH\nr\n=\n\u221e\nFigure 1: Conformal diagram of the extended Schwarzschild Anti-DeSitter spacetime. The\nthick curved line represents the trajectory of a cosmologically realistic brane, while EH\nlabels the event horizon. Note that here, and in all subsequent figures only the spacetime\nto the right of the brane exists.\ndeduce that the conformal diagram of five-dimensional Sch-AdS is given by figure 1. The\nleft and right vertical boundaries represent the spatial infinities, while the top and bottom\nboundaries correspond to the black and white hole singularities respectively. Although\n5\nthe Friedmann equation (4) is derived from the metric (2), it is still valid in all regions\nof the Sch-AdS spacetime, and hence we can use it to examine the trajectory of a brane\nmoving through such a spacetime. A cosmologically realistic brane that starts from an\ninitial singularity r = 0 with C+ > 0, and then expands forever will have the trajectory\nshown in figure 1. It begins at the white hole singularity, passes through the event horizon\nat r = 1 and continues off to infinity.\nWe can ask how the situation would change if the brane is emitting gravitons toward\nthe bulk, and more specifically how this would effect the black\/white hole mass parameter\nC+. In the next section we use a five-dimensional AdS generalisation of the ingoing Vaidya\nspacetime to model the effect of graviton emission by the brane, and hence derive the\nevolution equations for C+ and C\u2212. We then go on to discuss the extension of Vaidya\nspacetimes, and present suitable conformal diagrams to explain conceptually the results\ngiven in sections 4 and 5.\n3 Graviton Emission and Vaidya Spacetimes\nIn the previous section we discussed a brane moving through two different spacetimes\npossessing only a cosmological constant. We now go on to generalise the situation presented\nby Langlois et.al. [41], where the brane emits gravitons at early times, to the above non-Z2\nscenario [43].\nIn order to model this situation we use the five-dimensional generalisation of the in-\ncoming1 Vaidya metric,\nds2 = \u2212f\u00b1(r, v)dv2 + 2drdv + r2d\u03a32k, (13)\nwhere we once again assume a different spacetime either side of the brane and that k = 0,\nf\u00b1(r, v) = \u00b52r2 \u2212 C\n\u00b1(v)\nr2\n. (14)\nHere v is a null ingoing coordinate. Note that now the Weyl parameters C\u00b1(v) no longer\nrepresent purely the mass of the black hole in each spacetime, but instead represent the\nenergy contained inside the radius r for a given v, and hence describes an inward flow of\nradiation. If C\u00b1 did not depend on v, then the metric (13) would just be a rewriting of\nSchwarzschild-AdS, given by equation (2), as can be seen by the coordinate transformation\nv = T +\n\u222b\ndr\/f(r). The brane moves through both such spacetimes with trajectories given\nby v\u00b1(t\u02c6) and r(t\u02c6), where t\u02c6 is the time experienced by a brane based observer. Normalisation\nof the brane\u2019s velocity vector in each spacetime uA\u00b1 = {v\u02d9\u00b1, r\u02d9, 0, 0, 0} requires that,\nv\u02d9\u00b1 =\nr\u02d9 +\n\u221a\nf\u00b1 + r\u02d92\nf\u00b1\n, (15)\n1In the bulk the brane resides at the largest radius of the spacetime, hence any gravitons emitted will\ntravel inward.\n6\nwhich we will need later.\nThe incoming Vaidya metric is a solution to Einstein\u2019s equations with a bulk energy-\nmomentum-tensor corresponding to null ingoing radiation,\nT\u00b1AB = \u03c8k\n\u00b1\nAk\n\u00b1\nB , (16)\nwhere k\u00b1A are null ingoing vectors in each spacetime. By inserting the metric (13) and the\nstress-energy-tensor (16) into Einstein\u2019s equations we find that they will be solved provided\nthe Weyl parameters satisfy,\ndC\u00b1(v)\ndv\n=\n2\u03ba2\u03c8r3\n3\nk\u00b1v k\n\u00b1\nv . (17)\nThe appropriate normalisation of k\u00b1A is given by k\u00b1Au\n\u00b1A = 1, which implies that the only\nnon-zero component is k\u00b1r = k\u00b1v = 1\/v\u02d9\n\u00b1. Also \u03c8 is the flux of gravitons leaving a radiation\ndominated brane as seen by a brane observer, and has been shown by Langlois et. al. [41]\nto be,\n\u03c8 =\n\u03b1\n12\n\u03ba2\u03c1\u02c62, (18)\nwhere \u03b1 is a dimensionless constant. Note that here we implicitly assume that gravitons\nare produced in equal amounts either to the left or right of the brane. Particle interactions\nthat produce these gravitons will not feel the effect of different bulk masses either side of\nthe brane. However we will go on to show that the difference in the brane\u2019s trajectory in\neach spacetime alters the effect of the graviton emission so that it appears to be non-Z2\nsymmetric.\nCombining equations (15), (17) and (18), we get an expression for the evolution of\neither Weyl parameter due to graviton emission,\ndC\u00b1\ndt\u02c6\n=\n\u03b1\u03ba4\n18\nr3\u03c1\u02c62(\n\u221a\nr\u02d92 + f\u00b1 \u2212 r\u02d9). (19)\nIn order to determine the behaviour of a brane positioned between two such Vaidya space-\ntimes, we need to impose the Israel junction conditions [44\u201347] across the brane. These\nconditions relate the jump in the extrinsic curvature of the brane KAB = h\nC\nA\u2207CnB, where\nas usual nA is the unit vector normal to the brane and hAB = gAB \u2212 nAnB the induced\nmetric, to the brane\u2019s energy momentum tensor \u03c4AB = diag(\u2212\u03c1\u02c6\u2212\u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212\u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212\u03c3, P\u02c6 \u2212\u03c3, 0).\nThis can be written in the covariant form:\n[KAB] = \u03ba\n2(\u03c4AB \u2212 1\n3\n\u03c4hAB). (20)\nThe ordinary spatial components of these Junction Conditions show that the Friedmann\nequation for the brane is of the same form as that of equation (4). However, now both the\nWeyl parameter C and the non-Z2 parameter F are now functions of v and hence t. Using\nthe fact that H = r\u02d9\/r, we can use equations (4) and (3) to rewrite equation (19) as,\ndC\u00b1\ndt\u02c6\n=\n\u03b1\u03ba4\u03c1\u02c62r4\n18\n(\n\u03ba2\n6\n(\u03c1\u02c6+ \u03c3) \u2213 3\n2\u03ba2\n(C+ \u2212 C\u2212)\n(\u03c1\u02c6+ \u03c3)r4\n\u2212 H\n)\n. (21)\n7\nIt can immediately be seen that the process of graviton emission will lead to a reduction of\nthe Z2 symmetry since if C+ is greater\/less than C\u2212 then dC+\/dt will be less\/greater than\ndC\u2212\/dt, and hence the non-Z2 parameter F will decrease. To analyse this in more detail\nwe take the sum and difference of equations (21) to obtain expressions for the evolution of\nthe Weyl parameter C and the non-Z2 symmetry parameter F defined in equations (5),\ndC\ndt\u02c6\n=\n\u03b1\u03ba4\u03c1\u02c62r4\n18\u00b52\n(\n\u03ba2\n6\n(\u03c1\u02c6+ \u03c3) \u2212 H\n)\n, (22)\ndF\ndt\u02c6\n= \u2212 \u03b1\u03ba\n2\u03c1\u02c62\n6(\u03c1\u02c6+ \u03c3)\nF. (23)\nThese equations will be examined both analytically and numerically in sections 4 and 5\nfor various cases of interest.\nThe time and fifth dimension part of the Junction Conditions, given by equation (20),\nalso yield another relation representing the non-conservation of energy on the brane,\n\u02d9\u02c6\u03c1 + 3\nr\u02d9\nr\n(\u03c1\u02c6+ P\u02c6 ) = \u22122\u03c8. (24)\nThe factor of 2 on the right hand side is due to the fact that the brane is emitting a\nflux \u03c8 of gravitons into each spacetime either side of the brane. We have hence derived\nthe four \u2018master\u2019 equations that describe brane graviton emission into non-Z2 symmetric\nspacetimes, given by (4), (22), (23) and (24). In the next section we investigate the global\nproperties of Vaidya spacetimes in order to understand the results presented in sections 4\nand 5.\n3.1 Extension of the 5D Vaidya-AdS Spacetime\nWe have derived the relevant equations that describe both the motion of a graviton emit-\nting non-Z2 symmetric brane and the evolution of the mass parameters either side of the\nbrane. However, one should note that the coordinates (v, r) do not cover the whole of\nthe spacetime. Therefore we now show how to extend the Vaidya coordinates (see [50, 51]\nfor four dimensional examples), in order to gain a conceptual understanding of certain\ncases of interest, including when the brane emerges from the white hole. Previous authors\nhave ignored these solutions, mainly by assumption [41, 43, 52]. We mainly concentrate\non the situation where the BH mass parameter C+(v), is positive for all time; cases where\nC+(v) < 0 or where C+(v) changes sign can again be argued similarly [51].\nThe ingoing five-dimensional Vaidya metric (13) is conformally equivalent (after rescal-\ning r \u2192 r\/\u00b5 and v \u2192 v\/\u00b5) to:\nds2 = \u2212\n(\nr2 \u2212 r\n4\nh(v)\nr2\n)\ndv2 + 2dvdr + r2d\u03a320, (25)\nwhere r4h(v) = \u00b5\n2C+(v). Examining the Friedmann equation (4), it can be seen that if\nthe BH mass parameter is initially greater than zero (C+(v \u2192 \u2212\u221e) > 0), the brane\n8\nwill originate from the singularity inside the white hole (r = 0) and emerge from it at a\nlater time, similar to the non-emitting case. The above Vaidya coordinates only cover the\ninterior region of the black hole (along with one of the exterior regions) and hence need\nto be extended. The conformal diagram of the region covered by the (v, r) coordinates is\nPEH\nr = 0\nAH\nEH\nr = r(t)\nr\n=\n\u221e\nFigure 2: Conformal diagram of the unextended ingoing AdS Vaidya spacetime\nshown in figure 2, along with a possible trajectory of the brane (r = a(t)), the direction of\ngraviton emission (the dashed arrows) and the various horizons. EH represents the normal\nevent horizon of the black hole, whether PEH represents the past event horizon appearing\nat r = rh(v \u2192 \u2212\u221e). It can be seen that outgoing radial null geodesics emerge from\nthe PEH at finite values of their affine parameter and are hence incomplete: extension is\ntherefore required.\nFigure 2 also shows one of the main features of non-stationary spherically symmetric\nspacetimes, which is the decoupling of the apparent horizon (AH) from the event hori-\nzon [50]. The apparent horizon is the hypersurface separating the regions with or without\nclosed trapped surfaces (see [53] for more details), here given by r = rh(v), and will be\nmatched to a corresponding AH in the extended spacetime.\nIn general, extending Vaidya spacetimes is non-trivial as is discussed by [50]. One\nusually does not know the form of the \u2018mass function\u2019 C+(v) (and therefore rh(v)) in the\nextended part of the spacetime or indeed even whether radiation is ingoing or outgoing\nthere. This leads to many possible choices of extension. However, in the case whereby a\nbrane emits the radiation into the bulk, we do in principle know the general form of C+(v),\nand hence we can adapt Israel\u2019s extension of four-dimensional Vaidya spacetimes [54] to\nthe five-dimensional AdS Vaidya metric given in equation (25).\nChanging coordinates from (v, r) to (U, V ) by the transformation:\nr = AU + rh, v =\n\u222b V dx\nA(x)\n, (26)\n9\nwhere the function A(V ) is chosen to be:\nA(V ) =\n\u222b V\n0\n2rh(x)dx, (27)\nthe metric given by equation (25) then becomes,\nds2 =\n(\nU2(\u2212A2U2 + 2r2h)\n(AU + rh)2\n+\n2\nA\ndrh\ndV\n)\ndV 2 + 2 dUdV + (AU + rh)\n2 d\u03a320. (28)\nNote that the PEH has been mapped from (r = rh, v = \u2212\u221e) to (\u2212\u221e < U < \u221e, V = 0),\nand AH from (r = rh(v),\u2212\u221e < v <\u221e) to (U = 0, 0 < V <\u221e). The extended part of the\nspacetime corresponds to \u2212\u221e < V < 0. Some conditions must be imposed upon the mass\nfunction rh(V ) to ensure the finiteness and continuity of both the metric and the energy\nmomentum tensor [54] (which we know to still describe radiation leaving the brane), which\nare that rh(V ) must be a C\n2 function such that [50],\nrh(V = 0) 6= 0, drh\ndV\n1\nA\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nV =0\n< \u221e \u21d2 drh\ndV\n(V = 0) = 0. (29)\nWe have assumed the first condition to be true previously. As for the second condition,\ndemanding that the full metric satisfies the energy conditions [54] implies that,\ndrh\ndV\n{ \u2265 0 for V > 0\n\u2264 0 for V < 0 (30)\nand hence the second condition is satisfied purely by demanding that the metric is physi-\ncally realistic. This has some interesting implications: we can see that when the brane is in\nthe extended part (V < 0) of the spacetime, any graviton emissions will actually decrease\nthe size of the mass function rh(V ), and hence decrease C+(V ). The conformal diagram\nfor the extended spacetime is given by figure 3, which also shows the the direction of the\nemitted gravitons and the trajectory of the brane. This trajectory is a possible solution\nr(t) to the equations (4), (22), (23) and (24) which are still valid in the extended part of\nthe spacetime. One can see that the V < 0 region is actually a region of outgoing Vaidya\nspacetime with the metric,\nds2 = \u2212\n(\nr\u02dc2 \u2212 r\u02dc\n4\nh(v\u02dc)\nr\u02dc2\n)\ndv\u02dc2 \u2212 2dv\u02dcdr\u02dc + r\u02dc2d\u03a320. (31)\nOne should also note that the coordinates (U, V ) used to extend the spacetime are only\nvalid provided AU <\n\u221a\n2rh, which means they cover the interior of both the black and\nwhite holes, but do not extend to spacelike infinity (r =\u221e).\nFigure 3 shows that any gravitons emitted before the brane crosses V = 0 (equivalent to\nr = rh) are sent in an outward null direction and hence leave the white hole, subsequently\nescaping to infinity, and will therefore cause the mass parameter C+ to decrease. This is in\n10\nr = 0\nr\n=\n\u221e\nr\n=\n\u221e\nr = 0\nr = r(t)\nAH\nFigure 3: Conformal diagram of the extended ingoing AdS Vaidya spacetime\nagreement with equation (21) which gives that dC+\/dt will be greater\/less than zero if r is\ngreater\/less than rh (and a similar result for C\u2212). This situation where the mass parameter\ninitially decreases will occur at early times in the brane\u2019s cosmological evolution, when the\nbrane will be at high temperature. This raises the possibility that graviton emission at\nearly times could help to decrease C+ (and\/or C\u2212 and therefore also C), and hence decrease\nthe amount of dark radiation below the bounds set by the abundance of light elements\nat nucleosynthesis. Figure 3 shows the case where the mass function is symmetric either\nside of V = 0, but for an expanding, cooling brane thermally emitting gravitons the\nsituation would be very asymmetric and could lead to the final mass of the black hole\nbeing substantially smaller than that of the white hole.\nThe case where the black hole mass parameter is initially negative, before changing to\npositive is shown in figure 4. Initially, C+ < 0 and there is a naked singularity at r = 0.\nHowever, provided the brane emits enough gravitons, C+ will change sign and a black hole\nwill be formed [51]. In this situation, equation (21) shows that C+ always increases. One\nmust of course note that a naked singularity in the bulk is phenomenologically problematic\nfor a realistic brane world model. We can now use figures 3 and 4 to understand the general\ncase. As has been discussed above, regardless of the initial values of C+ and C\u2212, the non-\nZ2 parameter F will always decrease. The behaviour of the dark radiation parameter C\nis as follows: if 0 < C\u2212 < C+ (the spacetimes either side of the brane both correspond to\nfigure 3), then C will initially decrease until some time where C\u2212 < \u00b52r4 < C+, from which\npoint C will increase forever, asymptotically approaching a constant value as t \u2192 \u221e and\nthe brane cools. If C\u2212 < C+ < 0, (the spacetimes either side of the brane both correspond\nto figure 4), then C will increase for all time, asymptotically approaching a constant as\nbefore. If C\u2212 < 0 < C+, (the spacetime on the right\/left side of the brane corresponds to\nfigure 3\/4), then initially C\u2212 will increase, C+ will decrease and the exact behaviour of C\ndepends on the relative sizes of C+ and C\u2212. In each of the above cases the final magnitude\n11\nr = 0\nr\n=\n0\nr = 0\nr\n=\n\u221e\nEH\nAH\nr\n=\nr(\nt)\nFigure 4: Conformal diagram of a naked singularity changing to a black hole\n(and sign) of C is as yet undetermined so in the next two sections we give analytic and\nnumerical solutions that can be understood in terms of the conceptual arguments presented\nin this section.\nThroughout this paper we have assumed that the gravitons are emitted in a perpen-\ndicular direction from the brane and hence that a Vaidya spacetime is a realistic model\nof the situation. Examining the case where gravitons are emitted in all directions is far\nmore complicated [55], and is left to future work. However, we can use the above con-\nformal diagrams to gain some understanding of the effect of such emissions: in figure 3,\nnon-perpendicular gravitons would follow timelike geodesics leaving the brane. Therefore,\nwhen the brane is inside the white hole, not all of the gravitons that it emits during this\ntime will escape to infinity, and hence the mass parameter would not decrease as much as\nis described both above and in the following two sections.\n4 Equations for the Evolution of a Graviton Emitting\nnon-Z2 Brane\nWe now go on to discuss analytic solutions valid in the high\/low energy regimes and when\nthe C and F terms in the Friedmann equation are assumed to be subdominant. More\ngeneral situations will be examined numerically in the next section.\nFirst it is useful to define the following dimensionless parameters,\n\u03c1 =\n\u03c1\u02c6\n\u03c3\n, t = \u00b5t\u02c6, H =\nH\u02c6\n\u00b5\n. (32)\n12\nThe equations (4), (22), (23) and (24) can then be written in a somewhat simpler dimen-\nsionless form,\nH2 = \u03c12 + 2\u03c1+\nC\nr4\n+\nF 2\n(\u03c1+ 1)2r8\n, (33)\nd\u03c1\ndt\n= \u22124H\u03c1\u2212 \u03b1\u03c12, (34)\ndC\ndt\n= 2\u03b1r4\u03c12(\u03c1+ 1\u2212H), (35)\ndF\ndt\n= \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1\n2\n\u03c1+ 1\nF. (36)\nUnfortunately, finding a general analytical solution to these equations, such as that found\nby Leeper et. al. [42] for the Z2 symmetric case, is very difficult and hence we restrict our\nanalytical investigation to examine the early and late time limits only.\n4.1 The Early Time\/High Energy Limit\nAssuming a high energy limit such that \u03c1 \u226b 1, and also that the C and F terms in the\nFriedmann equation are sub-dominant, we can solve the evolution equations approximately.\nUnder these assumptions the Friedmann equation (33) takes the much simpler form of\nH2 \u2243 \u03c12. Combining this with equation (34) and integrating we obtain,\n\u03c1(t) =\n1\n(4 + \u03b1)t\n. (37)\nEquation (34) also shows that \u03c1 = \u03b3\/r4+\u03b1, where \u03b3 is a constant, and hence that,\nr(t) = [\u03b3(4 + \u03b1)t]\n1\n4+\u03b1 , (38)\nas opposed to the usual r \u223c t1\/4 in early brane world cosmology without graviton emission.\nTo find the time dependence of the non-Z2 parameter F we use the fact that \u03c1 \u226b 1 and\nhence equation (36) becomes dF\/dt \u2243 \u2212\u03b1\u03c1F , which when integrated using equation (34)\ngives,\nF = A\u03c1\n\u03b1\n4+\u03b1 =\nA\n[(4 + \u03b1)t]\n\u03b1\n4+\u03b1\n, (39)\nwhere A is a constant set by the initial conditions. It can be seen that although, as\nexpected, F decreases in this limit; it does so at a much slower rate compared to \u03c1. What\nis important here is the behaviour of the F term in the Friedmann equation (33), and we\ncan use the above results to show that,\nF 2\n(\u03c1+ 1)2r8\n\u2243 A\n2\n\u03b38\/(4+\u03b1)\n. (40)\n13\nSince the F term behaves as a constant this raises the possibility of it dominating the\nFriedmann equation for a period, similar to the case without graviton emission [48]. To\nfind the time dependence of C(t) we need to use the following approximation of H ,\nH \u2243 \u03c1 + 1 \u2212 1\n2\u03c1\n(\n1\u2212 C\nr4\n\u2212 F\n2\n(\u03c1+ 1)2r8\n)\n+ O(\u03c1\u22122). (41)\nInserting this into equation (35) and using equation (40) we obtain,\ndC(t)\ndt\n= \u03b1r4\u03c1\n(\n1\u2212 A\n2\n\u03b38\/(4+\u03b1)\n\u2212 C(t)\nr4\n)\n. (42)\nThe C(t)\/r4 term on the right hand side should not, in general, be neglected as was done\nin [41]. Using the above expressions for \u03c1(t) and r(t), this becomes,\ndC(t)\ndt\n=\nB\nt\n\u03b1\n4+\u03b1\n\u2212 \u03b1C(t)\n(4 + \u03b1)t\n, (43)\nwhere B is a constant given by,\nB = \u03b1\n\u03b3\n4\n4+\u03b1 \u2212 A2\/\u03b3 44+\u03b1\n(4 + \u03b1)\n\u03b1\n4+\u03b1\n. (44)\nEquation (43) has the solution,\nC(t) = B\n(\nt\n4\n4+\u03b1 +\nt0\nt\n\u03b1\n4+\u03b1\n,\n)\n(45)\nwhere t0 is an integration constant. Again, the important fact here is the behaviour of the\nC(t)\/r4 term in the Friedmann equation, compared to the dominant \u03c12 term. This can be\nwritten as,\nC(t)\nr4\n=\n\u03b1\n4 + \u03b1\n(1\u2212A2\/\u03b38\/4+\u03b1)(1 + t0(4 + \u03b1)\u03c1). (46)\nSo in general this term is not initially constant as assumed by [41], but instead has a \u03c1\ndependence, which could lead to it dominating the Friedmann equation at a later time, as\nwill be discussed in the next section2. This dependence agrees with the exact Z2 symmetric\nsolutions found in [42]. Note the effect here of the non-Z2 symmetric term: aside from\nacting like a cosmological constant in the Friedmann equation it has a significant effect on\nthe evolution of the Weyl parameter C. For example, if initially C = 0 and if A > \u03b34\/4+\u03b1\nthen C will behave as C \u223c \u2212r4 i.e. will grow more negative. This corresponds to the case\ndiscussed in section 3.1, where C\u2212 < 0 < C+ and there is initially a naked singularity\/black\nhole on the left\/right side of the brane. If C remains negative this could result in H = 0\nwhich would lead to the universe collapsing, and has to be investigated further.\n2The derived form of both the C and F terms in the Friedmann equation validate the assumption that\nthey are sub-dominant in this regime\n14\n4.2 The Late Time\/Low Energy Limit\nFor the low energy\/late time regime, we assume both that \u03c1 \u226a 1 and again that the C\nand F terms in the Friedmann equation are sub-dominant such that now H2 \u2243 2\u03c1. Using\nthis, equation (34) can now be integrated to give,\n\u03c1(t) \u2243 1[\n\u03c1\n\u22121\/2\ni + 2\n\u221a\n2(t\u2212 ti)\n]2 , (47)\nwhere \u03c1(ti) = \u03c1i, ti being the time the low energy approximation becomes valid. Note\nthe usual \u03c1 \u223c t\u22122 dependence of standard four-dimensional cosmology. Equation (34) also\nshows that r = (\u03b3\/\u03c1)1\/4, and inserting this into equation (36) and integrating, one obtains\nthe solution for the non-Z2 parameter in this late time regime in terms of \u03c1,\nF (\u03c1) \u2243 Fi exp\n[\n\u2212\u03b1\u03c1\n3\/2\ni\n6\n\u221a\n2\n(\n1\u2212\n(\n\u03c1\n\u03c1i\n)3\/2)]\n, (48)\nwhere F (\u03c1i) = Fi. Since the energy density at which the low energy approximations become\nvalid is given by \u03c1i \u2243 2, we see that in this regime F roughly decreases by a factor of e\u2212\u03b1\/3\nwhich is small as expected since the universe is now cooler and hence emits less gravitons.\nReplacing the above results for \u03c1(t), r(t) and F (t) into equation (35) and integrating; we\nget the solution for the behaviour of C in the late time limit which we write in terms of \u03c1\nfor convenience,\nC(\u03c1) \u2243 Ci + 1\u221a\n2\n\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\n1\/2\ni\n[\n1\u2212\n(\n\u03c1\n\u03c1i\n)1\/2]\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1i\n[\n1\u2212 \u03c1\n\u03c1i\n]\n, (49)\nwhere C(ti) = Ci. Depending upon the assumed value of \u03c1i, we can see that in this limit C\nroughly increases by \u03b1\u03b3, a small amount as expected. Note that in this regime the non-Z2\nsymmetry has no effect on the evolution of C, mainly due to being rapidly damped away as\nr increases. To analyse the effects of larger F and C terms, and to examine what happens\nbetween the regimes, we now turn to numerical methods.\n5 Numerical Analysis\nPreviously we have studied some aspects of non-Z2 symmetric graviton-emitting branes in\ncertain limits, but in order to gain a full understanding of the effects of non-Z2 symmetry\nin this scenario we solved the equations (33), (34), (35) and (36) numerically for a range\nof values of both C and F and the results are shown in figures 5 and 6.\nFigure 5(a) shows the time dependence of the four contributions to the Friedmann\nequation: \u03c12, 2\u03c1, C\/r4 and F 2\/((\u03c1+ 1)2r8), on a log scale, with the initial values (labelled\nby a subscript i) taken to be 2\u03c1i = 10000, Ci\/r4i = 500 and Fi\/((\u03c1i + 1)r4i ) = 0.05. The\ninitial time ti was chosen to be in agreement with equation (37) such that ti = ((4+\u03b1)\u03c1i)\n\u22121\n15\nin order for t = 0 to be the time of the initial singularity. The first thing to notice is the\nbehaviour of each of the terms as t \u2192 0. One can see that the \u03c12 term dominates as\nexpected, the F term tends to a constant in agreement with equation (40), and the C term\nis proportional to \u03c1 (as predicted by equation (46)) and does not necessarily tend to a\nconstant as assumed by [41]. As t \u2192 \u221e, the brane cools and graviton emission is hence\nreduced. Therefore, as in the non-emitting case, the F term is proportional to \u03c12, and C\/r4\nis proportional to the dominant 2\u03c1 term. Note that the ratio of dark radiation to normal\nradiation defined by,\n\u01eb(t) \u2261 (C\/r\n4)\n(2\u03c1)\n, (50)\nincreases only during the transition between these two limits, hence numerical analysis is\ndefinitely required to determine the final dark radiation content of the brane world model.\nThe evolution of C, 2F , C+ and C\u2212 is shown in figure 5(b), using the same initial\nconditions as in the previous figure. Note the behaviour of C+: initially it decreases, as\nthe brane has yet to emerge from the white hole on its +ve side. This corresponds to the\nextended part of the Vaidya spacetime as shown in figure 3, where any graviton emissions\nactually leave and hence reduce the size of the white hole. Once the brane passes the\nhorizon on its +ve side, then C+ begins to increase. C\u2212 increases from zero in a similar\nmanner to the limited cases discussed by [43]. Figure 5(c) shows a similar situation except\nthe initial value of C (and hence C\u2212) are both negative. The initial conditions are the same\nas the previous diagrams apart from now Ci\/r4i = \u2212400. One can see that C\u2212 changes\nfrom negative to positive. This means that on the \u2212ve side of the brane there is initially a\nnaked singularity (C\u2212 < 0) which later turns into a black hole (C\u2212 > 0). This corresponds\nto the conformal diagram given in figure 4, where the incoming gravitons always cause the\nmass parameter to increase. In general, all possible behaviour of F and C can be explained\nconceptually by figures 3 and 4.\nThe evolution of C(t) for different initial values of the F term (ranging from 0 to\n1.5) are shown in figure 5(d). It can be seen that at early times C(t) decreases with the\nC(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b1\/(4+\u03b1) behaviour given by equation (45), while at late times when there is less\ngraviton emission C(t) tends to a constant; the specific value of which is lower for larger\ninitial F . One can see that the conclusions made by [43], that a non-zero F can help reduce\nthe final value of the dark radiation term and hence satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds,\nare correct for small initial values of F . However, what has not been realised previously is\nthat if F is too large then, as is shown in figure 5(d), the final value of C(t) can be negative.\nThis raises the possibility of not only violating the lower nucleosynthesis bound on C, but\nalso of leading to H = 0, at which time the universe begins to collapse. An example of this\nis given in figure 6(a) which has initial values Ci\/r4i = 5000 and Fi\/((\u03c1i + 1)r4i ) = 22, and\nshows the magnitude of the contributions to the Friedmann equation on a log scale. One\ncan see that at a time given by log(t) \u2248 \u22126.1 the C term changes from positive to negative,\nand its magnitude subsequently becomes larger than the 2\u03c1 term. Since at late times the\nF term decreases much faster than the C term, the latter term will dominate. This leads\nto H = 0 at a time given by log(t) \u2248 0.56, and hence the universe collapses. Note that\n16\nprevious analysis of non-Z2 symmetry in the non-emitting case found that a large F term\nwas phenomenologically acceptable (at least in terms of the expansion rate) as this term is\nrapidly damped at late times. However, now we can see that this is not the case if the brane\nemits gravitons, as a large F term leads to the universe collapsing. Figure 6(b) shows the\ncase where the non-Z2 symmetry actually helps satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds. Initially\nCi\/r4i = 50 and Fi\/((\u03c1i+1)r4i ) = 2 and here the dark radiation term changes from positive\nto negative and then back to positive again, and the final ratio \u01ebf is given by,\n\u01ebf = \u01eb(t\u2192\u221e) < 0.037, (51)\nwhich is well inside the current constraints. For convenience we now define the value of\nthe F term as t\u2192 0 as,\nF\n(T )\ni =\nF\n(\u03c1+ 1)r4\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt\u21920\n. (52)\nNote that both F\n(T )\ni and \u01ebf have well defined constant values.\nIn order to understand the full effect of non-Z2 symmetry in this scenario, we graphed\nthe dependence of the final ratio \u01ebf on the initial size of the F term given by F\n(T )\ni for\nvalues of the emission parameter \u03b1 = 0.02, 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 as is shown in figure 6(c). In\nall cases the initial size of the dark radiation parameter C was zero. When F (T )i is small,\nthe larger \u03b1 is the larger \u01ebf will be, as expected. However, one can see that as discussed\nabove the larger the magnitude of F\n(T )\ni , the smaller the final ratio \u01ebf . If \u01ebf < \u22121 this will\ninevitably lead to H = 0 at some point in the late time regime (when only the 2\u03c1 and C\nterms can dominate) and hence cause the universe to collapse. Note how a larger \u03b1 leads\nto a much smaller range of allowed values for F\n(T )\ni that ensure that ultimately \u01ebf > \u22121.\nFigure 6(d) again shows a graph of the dependence of the final ratio \u01ebf on the initial\nsize of the F term: F\n(T )\ni . However, now the emission parameter is set to \u03b1 = 0.02 (as\ncalculated by [41]) and the initial ratio \u01ebi \u2261 (Ci\/r4i )\/(2\u03c1i) takes the values -0.25, 0, 0.25\nand 0.5. The two horizontal lines represent the upper and lower nucleosynthesis bounds\non the ratio of dark to normal radiation [56] given by,\n\u22120.41 < \u01ebf < 0.105. (53)\nWe can therefore obtain a combined restriction on the initial size of the F and C terms.\nThe results in figure 6(d) can be accurately approximated by the expression:\n\u01ebf \u2243 \u2212|F\n(T )\ni |\n205\n+\n\u03b1\n4 + \u03b1\n+ \u01ebi. (54)\nThe first term on the right hand side represents the effect of the non-Z2 symmetry, while\nthe second term is the approximate increase in the ratio of dark to normal radiation for\na Z2 symmetric brane as calculated by [41]. Combining equations (53) and (54) gives the\nfollowing restriction on the magnitude of the initial F term in terms of the initial ratio \u01ebi\ndue to the nucleosynthesis constraints,\n\u221220.5 + 205 \u01ebi < |F (T )i | < 85.1 + 205 \u01ebi, (55)\n17\nwhere we have kept all numerical terms to three significant figures. This shows that if\nthe initial dark radiation term is more than 10% of the normal radiation content of the\nuniverse, such that \u01ebi > 0.1, then 0 < |F (T )i | < 106 and hence the brane has to be non-Z2\nsymmetric; otherwise the nucleosynthesis constraints would not be satisfied. If on the other\nhand \u01ebi < \u22120.415 then the right hand side of equation (55) is less than zero and regardless\nof the size of the F term, the nucleosynthesis constraints will be violated.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have analysed the dynamics of a non-Z2 symmetric brane that emits gravitons at\nearly times, using an AdS-Vaidya spacetime approximation. The equations governing\nthe evolution of the energy density \u03c1, the scale factor a, the dark radiation parameter C\nand the non-Z2 symmetry parameter F were derived and analysed. We then discussed\nthe structure of the five-dimensional AdS-Vaidya spacetimes that reside either side of\nthe brane. It was shown how the ingoing five-dimensional AdS-Vaidya spacetime was\nincomplete, and that an extension was required in order to understand some of the relevant\ncases of interest, including when the black hole mass parameter on one side of the brane\nstarts from a non-zero value. The conceptual arguments presented suggested that in some\ncases graviton emission would cause the black hole mass parameter to initially decrease\n(while the brane was still inside the white hole) before increasing at later times, a fact\nthat has either been ignored or has caused some confusion in the literature [41\u201343]. The\ncase where the black hole mass was initially less than zero was discussed, and it was shown\nhow here, graviton emission would always lead to the mass parameter increasing and in\nsome situations becoming positive. These conceptual arguments were used to interpret the\nanalytical and numerical results in the rest of the paper.\nIn section 4 we solved the evolution equations in the high energy\/early time and low\nenergy\/late time limits in order to understand the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions.\nIt was shown how even though the non-Z2 symmetric parameter F decreases with time,\nthe non-Z2 symmetric term in the Friedmann equation remains constant as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, just\nlike the symmetric case. Similarly, the dark radiation term C\/r4, if initially large was found\nto be proportional to \u03c1. In the late time regime it was shown how both C and F rapidly\ntend to constants as the brane is cooler and much less graviton emission is occurring.\nNumerical results were then presented, showing the behaviour of each of the four terms\nin the Friedmann equation for various initial values of C and F . Graphs of C, F , C+\nand C\u2212 were also given which exhibited the behaviour described in section 3.1 (and in\nfigures 3 and 4), which corresponds to nonzero initial values of C+ and C\u2212: cases which\nhave previously been ignored in the literature3. We demonstrated that in general a large\nnon-Z2 symmetric term will lead to a decrease in the asymptotic ratio of dark radiation\nto normal radiation given by \u01ebf . If F is large enough then C and hence \u01ebf will become\n3Note that in [43] they do examine one case where initially C = 0 and F > 0, and hence C+ > 0 and\nC\u2212 < 0. The brane therefore starts inside the horizon on its positive side, even though the authors have\nassumed throughout that the brane is always outside the horizon.\n18\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n 0\n 10\n 20\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6\nlo\ng \nof\n c\non\ntri\nbu\ntio\nn \nto\n H\n^2\nlog(t)\n2rho\nrho^2\nC term\nF term\n(a\n)\nC\no\nn\ntr\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\ns\nto\nth\ne\nF\nri\ned\nm\na\nn\nn\neq\nu\na\nti\no\nn\no\nf\n\u03c1\n2\n,\n2\n\u03c1\n,\nC\/\nr4\na\nn\nd\nF\n2\n\/\n((\n\u03c1\n+\n1\n)2\nr8\n).\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n 0.06\n 0.08\n 0.1\n 0.12\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6\nre\nla\ntiv\ne \nsi\nze\n o\nf C\n a\nnd\n F\nlog(t)\nC\n2F\nC^+\nC^-\n(b\n)\nE\nv\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nC,\n2\nF\n,\nC+\na\nn\nd\nC\u2212\n,\nw\nit\nh\n2\nF\ni\n=\nC i\na\nn\nd\nth\ner\nef\no\nre\nC\u2212 i\n=\n0\n.\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.06\n-0.04\n-0.02\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n 0.06\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6\nre\nla\ntiv\ne \nsi\nze\n o\nf C\n a\nnd\n F\nlog(t)\nC\n2F\nC+\nC-\n(c\n)\nE\nv\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nC,\n2\nF\n,\nC+\na\nn\nd\nC\u2212\n,\nb\nu\nt\nin\nit\nia\nll\ny\nw\nit\nh\nC\na\nn\nd\nC\u2212\n<\n0\n.\n-0.04\n-0.02\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n 0.06\n 0.08\n 0.1\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6\nC(\nt)\nlog(t)\nInitial F = 0.0\nInitial F = 0.5\nInitial F = 1.0\nInitial F = 1.5\n(d\n)\nE\nv\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nC(\nt)\nfo\nr\nd\niff\ner\nen\nt\nin\nit\nia\nl\nva\nlu\nes\no\nf\nF\n.\nF\nig\nu\nre\n5:\nN\nu\nm\ner\nic\nal\nR\nes\nu\nlt\ns\n19\n-10 -5  0  5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n 0\n 2\nlog of contribution to H^2\nlog(t)\n2rho\nrho^2\nC term\nF term\n(a) Contributions to the Friedmann\nequation where F is large enough\nto ensure that C turns negative and\nhence leads to H2 = 0.\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10 -5  0  5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\nlog of contribution to H^2\nlog(t)\n2rho\nrho^2\nC term\nF term\n(b) Contributions to the Friedmann\nequation where the C term turns neg-\native then positive.\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2  0\n 0.2\n-10\n-5\n 0\n 5\n 10\nFinal ratio of dark radiation to rho\nInitial size of F term\n1.0\n0.4\n0.2\n0.02\n(c) Graph of (C\/r4)\/(2\u03c1)(t\u2192 \u221e) for\n\u03b1 = 1.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.02 against different\ninitial values for the F term.\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2  0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n-200\n-100\n 0\n 100\n 200\nFinal ratio of dark radiation to rho\nInitial size of F term\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n-0.25\n(d) Graph of (C\/r4)\/(2\u03c1)(t \u2192 \u221e)\nagainst initial F term for \u03b1 = 0.02\nand Ci = 0.5, 0.25, 0.0,\u22120.25.

Interestingly, these constraints are\nall independent of M5, the five-dimensional Plank mass.\nAnother interesting mechanism, besides graviton emission by the brane, that would\naffect the evolution of the non-Z2 symmetric and dark radiation terms is the possibility of\nthe bulk black holes Hawking radiating. This has non-trivial effects on the evolution of C\nand F , especially when combined with graviton emissions, and will be investigated in [57].\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to A.C.
