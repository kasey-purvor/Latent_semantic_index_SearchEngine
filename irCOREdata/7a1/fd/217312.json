To measure income inequality with right censored (topcoded) data, we propose \nmultiple imputation methods for estimation and inference. Censored observations are \nmultiply imputed using draws from a flexible parametric model fitted to the censored \ndistribution, yielding a partially synthetic dataset from which point and variance estimates \ncan be derived using complete data methods and appropriate combination formulae. The \nmethods are illustrated using U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS) data and the Generalized \nBeta of the Second Kind distribution as the imputation model. With CPS internal data, we \nfind few statistically significant differences in income inequality for pairs of years between \n1995 and 2004. We also show that using CPS public use data with cell mean imputations may \nlead to incorrect inferences. Multiply-imputed public use data provide an intermediate \nsolution. \n \nKey Words: Income Inequality, Topcoding, Censored Data, Multiple Imputation, Current \nPopulation Survey, Generalized Beta of the Second Kind distribution \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nMany data sets used to measure income inequality are right censored (\u2018topcoded\u2019). To \nmaximize confidentiality and to minimize disclosure risk, data producers do not release files \ncontaining complete survey responses. Instead, income values for each income source that are \nabove a source-specific threshold are replaced in public use files by the threshold itself (the \n\u2018topcode\u2019). Right censoring is a problem for estimation of inequality levels because it \nsuppresses genuine income dispersion, and it is a problem for estimation of inequality trends \nif topcode values are not adjusted consistently over time. Topcoding also affects estimates of \nstandard errors of inequality statistics because variance estimates depend on second- and \nhigher-order moments, and their calculation is affected by right censoring. In this paper, we \npropose a multiple imputation approach to estimation of and inference about inequality using \ntopcoded data, illustrating the method with data from the U.S. March Current Population \nSurvey (CPS). \n 1\n The CPS has been widely used both within and outside government to assess \ninequality of individual earnings and household income. All CPS data on income sources are \nsubject to censoring, however, which is a major potential limitation. Topcoding in the CPS \npublic use files is common, as we show below. Even the internal CPS data, used by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau to produce official income distribution statistics, are also topcoded though to \na substantially lesser degree (see e.g. Census Bureau 2009). In both types of CPS data, \ntopcode values have not been adjusted consistently over time. Burkhauser et al. (2008) \nreview CPS topcoding practices and provide references to earlier discussions of topcoding.  \n Although our proposed methods are illustrated with reference to the CPS, they are \napplicable more widely since the CPS is not the only survey with topcoded data. For \nexample, in the U.S.A., the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth topcodes some of its \nincome sources as does the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In the United Kingdom, in \norder to comply with the Statistics and Registration Services Act of 2007, the Annual \nPopulation Survey and the Quarterly Labour Force Survey have introduced topcodes on \nearnings data in public release files. In Germany, the wage data that are available from social \ninsurance administrative registers are right censored at the earnings level corresponding to the \nupper limit to social insurance contributions. \n Without imputation of some kind, point identification of inequality measures from \ncensored data is impossible in general. Manski (2003) addressed related issues and shows \nthat, with censoring, one may derive an identification region \u2013 the lower and upper bounds \u2013 \nof some statistics summarizing censored distributions, notably parameters such as the mean \nand quantiles (2003: 11). Applying these results to internal and public use CPS data, \nBurkhauser et al. (2009) show that the bounds on the P90\/P10 income inequality measure \n(the ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile) vary substantially with the prevalence \nof topcoding, because topcoded observations arise at incomes below the 90th percentile. In \naddition, there is also the problem that percentile ratio inequality measures are not based on \nincomes from throughout the income range. This limitation is not shared by inequality \nmeasures based on all incomes such as Lorenz curves, the Gini coefficient, coefficient of \nvariation, and members of the Atkinson and Generalized Entropy classes of inequality indices \n\u2013 all widely used in the academic income distribution literature and official statistics, and \nreviewed by Cowell (2000). However, Manski\u2019s (2003) results do not apply to these \nmeasures: with right-censored data, the bounds on the measures are uninformative because \nthe upper bound is the maximum possible value. So, to make further progress with \nestimation, some form of imputation for censored incomes is necessary. \n 2\n All previous imputation procedures applied to CPS data that we are aware of have \nused methods that yield a single imputation for each right censored value. And only rarely \nhas the sampling variability of the estimates derived from the imputation-augmented data also \nbeen estimated in a manner that takes proper account of the right censoring. We propose a \nmultiple imputation approach to estimating inequality measures using topcoded data. The \napproach is closely related to, but was developed independently from, the parametric multiple \nimputation method proposed by An and Little (2007) for topcoded data, though we focus on \nmeasures of inequality rather than means and regression coefficients as they do. \n We show how our approach provides consistent estimates of not only inequality \nmeasures but also their sampling variances, accounting for both stochastic imputation error \nand sampling variability. We use the method to analyze recent trends in household income \ninequality in the U.S.A., exploiting our unprecedented access to internal CPS data.  \n Throughout the paper, income is defined in a conventional manner. It is household \nincome from all sources excluding capital gains, adjusted for differences in household size \nusing the square root of household size. It is what US analysts refer to as \u2018pre-tax post-\ntransfer\u2019 income. The specific procedures followed when constructing the income measure \nare as discussed by Burkhauser and Larrimore 2009. This income definition is common in the \ncross-national comparative income distribution literature (cf. Atkinson, Rainwater and \nSmeeding 1995) and studies of U.S. income distribution trends (cf. Gottschalk and Danziger \n2005). Each individual is attributed with the size-adjusted income of the household to which \nhe or she belongs. Income refers to income for the calendar year preceding the March \ninterview. All references to \u2018year\u2019 are to income year rather than survey year. We convert \nnegative and zero household income values each year (never more than one percent of cases) \nto one dollar prior to our calculations because a number of inequality indices are defined only \nfor positive income values. Our samples comprise all individuals in CPS respondent \nhouseholds, excluding individuals in group quarters or in households containing a member of \nthe military. All statistics are calculated using the relevant CPS sampling weights. The \nweights adjust for non-response associated with observable characteristics, but not \nunobservables. Sample sizes are large. For example, for 2004, the sample income distribution \nrefers to 207,925 individuals in 75,660 households. \n We compare our multiple imputation estimates of inequality levels and trends from \nthe internal CPS data \u2013 what we label the Internal-MI series \u2013 with two series of estimates \nderived from public use CPS data which we label Public-CM and Public-MI. The Public-CM \nseries arises when top-coded values are replaced by cell mean imputations derived from \n 3\ninternal CPS data. These imputations have been provided by the U.S. Census Bureau for each \nyear since 1995, and are available to all users of public use CPS data. The availability of this \nseries is one reason why we restrict our attention to the period 1995\u20132004 in this paper. A \nsecond reason is that we wish to avoid any potential inconsistencies in the income series \narising from the major CPS redesign including the introduction of computer-assisted personal \ninterviewing in survey year 1994 (Ryscavage 1995). Third, it is well-known that U.S. income \ninequality increased substantially between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s (see e.g. \nDanziger and Gottschalk 1995), and so we focus on a later period about which there is less \nunanimity. For the decade starting from the mid-1990s, there is debate about the nature of \ninequality trends, but there is agreement that ascertaining trends in the very richest incomes is \nof particular importance in the U.S.A. and a number of other OECD countries (see e.g. \nAtkinson and Piketty 2007, Burkhauser et al. 2008, and Piketty and Saez 2003).  \n The third series we analyze, labelled Public-MI, is also derived from public use CPS \ndata, but applies a multiple imputation approach to estimation and inference that mimics the \none that we apply to internal data. Although the internal data provide the best results, \nresearchers can get access to them only under special conditions, whereas public use data are \navailable to all researchers. It is therefore of interest to explore the extent to which results \nfrom the Public-MI series match those from the Internal-MI one. \n Using multiply-imputed internal CPS data, we show that the inequality of household \nincome did not change significantly between 1995 and 2004, whether one uses ordinal \nevaluations based on Lorenz curves or cardinal comparisons based on a number of \ncommonly-used inequality indices. We find that the cell-mean-augmented public use data \nlead to substantial under-estimates of inequality levels in every year, though the trends over \ntime are tracked relatively well. However, the sampling variability of estimates derived from \nthe cell-mean-augmented distributions is also under-estimated and, as a result, there is a \ntendency for inequality trends over the period to be shown (incorrectly) as statistically \nsignificant. Multiply-imputed public use data are shown to provide an intermediate case.  \n \n \n2. Right censoring in income data from the March CPS \n \n In the March CPS, a respondent in each household is asked a series of questions on \nthe sources of income for the household. Starting in 1975, respondents reported income from \n11 sources, and since 1987 they have done so for income from 24 sources. High values for \n 4\neach separate income source are topcoded by the Census Bureau; it is not only the highest \ntotal household income values that are topcoded. See Larrimore et al. (2008) for a full list of \ntopcode values in the public use and internal CPS data, by income source.  \n The prevalence of topcoding in total household income is significantly greater than \nfor any specific income source, since household income is the aggregation of multiple income \nsources across income types and household members, and each source may be topcoded. As a \nresult, and also because income is measured using size-adjusted household income rather \nthan nominal household income (see above), topcoded household income values are not \nnecessarily the highest incomes \u2013 right censored observations may occur throughout the \nincome distribution. Hence measuring inequality using the ratio of the 90th percentile to the \n10th percentile (P90\/P10) with the goal of minimizing the impact of topcoding on inequality \nestimates will not be entirely successful: see Burkhauser et al. (2009).  \n The proportion of individuals with topcoded household income in each March CPS \nfrom 1995 through 2004 is shown in Figure 1. In the public use data, the fraction is \nsubstantial, ranging between 2.1% and 5.7%. In the internal data, the proportion is roughly \nconstant and small, only about 0.5%. The much lower prevalence of right censoring in the \ninternal data indicates their substantial value for assessments of inequality compared to public \nuse data. Using internal data rather than the public use data means that incomes are better \nmeasured for up to approximately 5.5% (5.7% \u2013 0.5%) more observations. Nevertheless, \ncensoring remains pervasive in the internal data. The mean size-adjusted household income \nvalue for topcoded observations in the internal data is around $200,000. In the internal data \nfor 1995, the lowest decile of the distribution of topcoded incomes corresponds to the 55th \npercentile of the distribution for all incomes. For 2000, the lowest decile of the distribution \ncorresponds to the 87th percentile of the overall distribution, and somewhere between these \npositions in the other years. So, accurate measurement of the degree of inequality needs to \naccount for a non-trivial degree of right-censoring, even with CPS internal data. Our multiple \nimputation approach to estimation and inference provides this. \n 5\n01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nP\ner\nce\nnt\nag\ne \nto\npc\nod\ned\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n \nFigure 1.

Single imputation methods to account for topcoding \n \nThe two principal imputation approaches to account for topcoding in public use CPS data that \ncurrently exist are reviewed in this section. The first approach is empirically based, using cell \nmeans derived from internal CPS data. Another more ad hoc imputation procedure, used e.g. \nby Katz and Murphy (1992), Lemieux (2006), and Autor et al. (2008), is to replace each \ntopcoded value by a common multiple of the topcode. The second approach is model based, \nassuming that the upper tail of the income distribution has a specific parametric functional \nform. These approaches yield a single augmented data set for analysis in which each \ntopcoded value is replaced by a single imputed value: they are therefore \u2018single imputation\u2019 \nmethods. \n For each year of public use data since income year 1995 (survey year 1996), the \nCensus Bureau has imputed a cell mean value to each topcoded value in the public use data. \nBefore 1995, the public use CPS data for each income source contained the topcode value for \neach income source for each observation topcoded on that source. These imputations, derived \n 6\nfrom internal CPS data, are, for each source, equal to the mean source income of all \nindividuals with incomes greater than or equal to the topcode, subject to some constraints on \nminimum cell size. For labour income sources, the means are calculated within cells further \ndivided by race, gender, and employment status. The Census Bureau initially provided cell \nmeans for wages and salaries, self-employment income and farm income, but later extended \nthem to other non-governmental income sources (1998 and thereafter). Larrimore et al. \n(2008) provide further details of the derivation. They also distribute a consistent set of cell \nmean imputations to the wider research community that extends the Census Bureau series \nback to 1975.  \n These cell mean imputations are a substantial advance for analysis, providing more \naccurate measures of the incomes of topcoded observations than do the topcodes themselves. \nThey have two limitations, however, which lead to underestimation of overall inequality \nstatistics and their sampling variances. First, by construction, all observations within the same \ncell receive the same imputed value, thereby removing all within-cell income variation. \nSecond, the cell means are derived from internal data which are themselves right censored. \nThis imparts a downward bias to cell mean estimates of topcoded incomes, and hence also a \ndownward bias in estimates of overall inequality and its sampling variance. This bias is of \nunknown degree since the actual incomes of the censored observations in the internal data are \nunknown. \n The second single imputation approach was developed before the Census Bureau cell \nmean series existed. Fichtenbaum and Shahidi (1988), using public use CPS data for 1967\u2013\n1984, proposed that the upper tail of the U.S. income distribution for each be summarized by \nthe one parameter Pareto distribution. Estimates of the Gini inequality index for each year \nderived using the Pareto estimates were shown to be between 0.9% and 7.3% greater than \ncorresponding Gini indices estimated ignoring topcoding. Essentially the same method was \napplied by Bishop et al. (1994) except that they used unit record public use CPS data rather \nthan grouped data, examined 1985\u20131989, and compared entire distributions using Lorenz \ncurves as well as Gini coefficients. Bishop et al. (1994) also estimated sampling variances for \ntheir inequality statistics, and used statistical inference procedures to test inequality \ndifferences. However, these procedures did not take account of the additional variability \nintroduced by the stochastic nature of the imputation process.  \n In addition to ignoring imputation uncertainty, the Pareto imputation method has the \ndisadvantage, shared with the cell mean imputation approach, that only a single value is \nimputed to every topcoded observation in the relevant year, so income dispersion is under-\n 7\nestimated. Moreover, and as acknowledged by the authors cited, the goodness of the Pareto \nfit to CPS income data is debatable. On this, see e.g. Angle and Tolbert (1999). This suggests \nthat the use of less restrictive parametric functional forms is productive in this context. In the \nnext section, we make the case for applying the GB2 distribution to CPS data on household \nincomes, and for using a multiple rather than single imputation approach. \n \n4. A multiple imputation approach to account for topcoding \n \nOur multiple imputation approach consists of five steps, which we outline before discussing \nin more detail. First we fit an imputation model \u2013 a parametric functional form that is \npresumed to describe the income distribution in each year 1995\u20132004, including right \ncensored observations. Second, for each observation with a right censored income, we draw a \nvalue from the distribution implied by the fitted model using an appropriate randomization \nprocedure. Third, using the distribution comprising imputed incomes for censored \nobservations and observed incomes for non-censored observations, we estimate our various \ninequality indices and associated sampling variances using complete data methods. Fourth, \nwe repeat the second and third steps one hundred times for each year, and finally, we \ncombine the estimates from each of the one hundred data sets for each year using the \naveraging rules proposed by Reiter (2003) for the case of \u2018partially synthetic\u2019 data. This \naccounts for the uncertainty added to estimates by the imputation process as well as for \nsampling variability. Application of the five-step approach to internal CPS data yields our \nInternal-MI series of estimates; application to public use CPS data yields our Public-MI \nseries. \n Ours is the only study that we are aware of that has applied multiple imputation \nmethods to right censored data for the purposes of analyzing income inequality. The closest \nstudy to ours is An and Little (2007). They fit lognormal and power-transformed normal \ndistributions to data from the 1995 Chinese household income project, and use the estimates \nto multiply impute incomes to topcoded observations. Their focus was on estimation of and \ninference about mean incomes and income regressions for a single year rather than estimates \nand comparisons of income inequality measures and trends. Gartner and R\u00e4ssler (2005) used \nlognormal distributions fitted to German wage data for 1991\u20132001 to multiply impute values \nfor topcoded observations. Again the focus was estimation and inference concerning mean \nincomes and income regressions rather than income inequality. \n 8\n We assume that the distribution of size-adjusted household income in each year is \ndescribed by the four parameter Generalised Beta of the Second Kind (GB2) distribution \n(McDonald 1984), with probability density function \n[ ] 0,)\/(1),()(\n1\n>+= +\n\u2212\ny\nbyqpBb\nayyf qpaap\nap\n (1)\nand cumulative density function (CDF) \nF(y) = I( p, q, (y\/b)a \/ [1 + (y\/b)a] ), y > 0, (2)\nwhere parameters a, b, p, q, are each positive. B(p, q) = \u0393(p)\u0393(q)\/\u0393(p + q) is the Beta \nfunction, \u0393(.) is the Gamma function, and I(p, q, x) is the regularized incomplete beta \nfunction also known as the incomplete beta ratio. Parameter b is a scale parameter, and a, p, \nand q are each shape parameters. The GB2 is a flexible functional form incorporating many \ndistributions as special cases. For example, the Singh-Maddala (Burr type 12) distribution is \nthe special case of the GB2 distribution when p = 1; the Dagum (Burr type 3) distribution is \nthe special case when q = 1; and the lognormal distribution is a limiting case. For details, see \nMcDonald (1984) and Kleiber and Kotz (2003). Many studies have shown that the GB2 \nmodel fits income distributions extremely well across different times and countries: see inter \nalia McDonald (1984), Bordley et al. (1996), Brachmann et al. (1996), Bandourian et al. \n(2003), and Jenkins (2009). \n Of particular importance in the current context is the desirable behaviour of the GB2 \ndistribution in its upper tail. Consistent with extreme value theory, the upper and lower tails \nlie in the domain of attraction of the Fr\u00e9chet distribution. The upper tail is regularly varying \n(with variation parameter equal to \u2013aq) and it is heavy in that it decays like a power function \nas income increases, rather than decaying exponentially fast (as for the log-normal \ndistribution, with middle heavy upper tail), or polynomial decreasing (as for Pareto \ndistributions). See Schluter and Trede (2002, Appendix A) and Kleiber and Kotz (2003) on \nregular variation concepts and the upper tail behaviour of GB2 and other distributions.  \n We estimate the GB2 distribution parameters by maximum likelihood (ML), \nseparately for each year 1995\u20132004. To ensure that model fit was maximized at the top of the \ndistribution, we fit each GB2 distribution using observations in the richest 70 percent of the \ndistribution only, making appropriate corrections for left truncation in the ML procedure. We \nchose the 30th percentile as the left truncation point after experiments balancing goodness of \nfit with ease of maximization. We specify the sample log-likelihood for each year\u2019s data as \n 9\n\u2211\n= \u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\n\u2212+\u2212=\nN\ni\niiii\ni zF\nyfcyFcwL\n1 )(1\n)](ln[)1()](1ln[\nln  (3)\nwhere i = 1,\u2026, N, indexes each individual sample observation, wi is the sample weight for i, \nand ci = 1 if i is an observation with a right censored household income value, and ci = 0 \notherwise. The denominator of the expression adjusts for left truncation: z is the income level \ncorresponding to the left truncation point. For maximization, we use the modified Newton-\nRaphson procedure implemented in Stata\u2019s ml command (StataCorp, 2007), with the \nparameter covariance matrix estimates based on the negative inverse Hessian. Convergence \nwas achieved easily within several iterations. For brevity, we do not report estimates for each \nyear but they are available from the authors on request. \n For the internal data, model fit varied slightly across years, but was generally \nexcellent. This is demonstrated first by the precision of the parameter estimates. For example, \nthe smallest t-ratio for any parameter estimate (always for p) was greater than seven, and was \ntypically at least two or three times larger for a and for q, and in between for b. Wald tests of \nparameter values suggested that we could easily reject restricted models such as the Singh-\nMaddala or Dagum distributions in favour of the GB2 distribution. Excellent goodness of fit \nto the internal data is also demonstrated by probability plots for each year shown in Figure 2 \nof Jenkins et al. (2009). These are plots of the cumulative probabilities of income expected \ngiven the estimated GB2 parameters against the cumulative probabilities of income observed \nin the data. Each chart is based on the richest 70% of each distribution for each year, for the \nreasons explained earlier. Excellent goodness of fit is demonstrated by the fact that every plot \nlies extremely close to a 45\u00b0 ray from the origin, and much closer than is typically observed \nin plots of this type. There is also no obvious change in the nature of the plots around the \nneighbourhood of the very richest observations. Such smoothness increases our confidence in \nthe use of the GB2 for imputing incomes to right censored observations in the internal CPS \ndata. \n We also fit GB2 models separately to public-use data for each year, using procedures \nthat mimicked those for the internal data. Given the greater prevalence of right-censoring, \nmodel goodness-of-fit was not quite as good as for the internal data, but very good \nnonetheless. This is illustrated by the probability plots shown by Jenkins et al. (2009, \nAppendix Figure A).  \n The second stage of our multiple imputation approach uses the GB2 estimates to \nderive imputed values for topcoded observations for each year using the inverse transform \n 10\nsampling method. Given fitted GB2 CDF, , the corresponding CDF for topcoded \nobservation i is, using standard formulae for truncated distributions: \n)(\u02c6 yF\n)](\u02c61\/[)](\u02c6)(\u02c6[)(\u02c6 iiii tFtFyFyG \u2212\u2212=  (4)\nwhere ti is the topcode for i, and yi is the \u2018true\u2019 value for that observation (which we are \nunable to observe). Letting ui = , and inverting the expression for the income \ndistribution among topcoded observations, we have  \n)(\u02c6 iyG\n( ))(\u02c6)](\u02c61[\u02c6 1 iiii tFtFuFy +\u2212= \u2212 . (5)\nA value of yi for each topcoded observation is generated by substituting into this expression a \nvalue of ui equal to a random draw from a standard uniform distribution. An alternative \napproach to taking draws (suggested by a referee) would have been to use Halton or \nHammersley sequences. Because we use a household-level income definition, all individuals \nwithin the same household are imputed with the same value. \nThe combination of the observed incomes for non-topcoded observations with the \nimputed incomes for topcoded observations produces a partially synthetic data set for each \nyear to which we can apply complete data methods to estimate our inequality statistics of \ninterest. (Fully synthetic data consist of entirely multiply imputed data.) Repetition of the \nprocess m > 1 times produces m partially synthetic data sets for each year and, \ncorrespondingly, m sets of inequality estimates for each year which we combine in a manner \ndiscussed shortly. Note that the observations without censored data are common across each \nof the m partially synthetic data sets. Clear cut rules for the choice of m do not exist, but the \nnumber used is often relatively small (10 or fewer). In the next section, we report estimates \nbased on m = 100. In preliminary research, we used m = 20 and derived similar conclusions \nto those reported here. \n For inference from our multiply-imputed partially synthetic data sets, we use the \ncombination formulae derived by Reiter (2003), also used by An and Little (2007), as \nfollows. \nSuppose that inference is required about some scalar Q, where Q is a measure of \ninequality such as the Gini index, and index the partially synthetic data sets by j = 1, \u2026, m. \nDenote the point estimator of Q from partially synthetic data set j by qj and the estimator of \nits variance by vj. Reiter (2003) shows that one should estimate Q using the mean of the point \nestimators \n 11\nmqq\nm\nj\njm \/\n1\n\u2211\n=\n=  (6)\nand use \nmmp vmbT += )\/(  (7)\nto estimate the variance of mq , where  \n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\u2212=\nm\ni\nmim mqqb\n1\n2 )1\/()(   and  \u2211\n=\n=\nm\nj\njm mvv\n1\n\/ . (8)\nThus, the multiple imputation point estimate is the simple average of the point estimates \nderived using complete data methods from each of the m partially synthetic data sets. The \nvariance of this estimate is the average of the sampling variances plus a term reflecting the \nfinite number of imputations, m. Tp differs from Rubin\u2019s (1987) rule for the combination of \nestimates in the fully synthetic data case, in which case mmmp vmbbT ++= \/ . The expression \nfor the fully synthetic data case includes additional variability (the term bm) to average over \nthe response mechanism (Rubin 1987). By contrast, \u2018[t]his additional averaging is \nunnecessary in partially synthetic data settings since the selection mechanism \u2026 is not \ntreated as stochastic\u2019 (Reiter 2003, p. 5). The selection mechanism in our case refers to the \nchoice of topcodes by the Census Bureau for the CPS. For large sample sizes, inference \nconcerning Q can be based on t-distributions with degrees of freedom vp =  \nwhere \n21)1)(1( \u2212+\u2212 mrm\n)\/( 1 mmm vbmr\n\u2212= . Because our sample sizes are large and m is large, vp is very large \nalso, so the t-distribution is approximated very well by a normal distribution and that is what \nwe use for inference.  \n Because cardinal indices of inequality differ in their sensitivities to income \ndifferences in different ranges of the income distribution (Atkinson 1970), we estimate \ninequality indices that reflected this feature in a systematic way. Specifically, we consider the \nmean log deviation (MLD), Theil index, and half the coefficient of variation squared (CV2\/2), \nplus the Gini coefficient. The first three indices belong to the one parameter Generalized \nEntropy class GE(\u03b1) with parameter \u03b1 = 0, 1, 2, respectively, and range from being bottom-\nsensitive (MLD) to being sensitive to income differences at the top of the distribution \n(CV2\/2). The commonly-used Gini coefficient is a middle-sensitive inequality index. For a \nreview of inequality index properties and index formulae, see Cowell (2000). We computed \ndistribution-free variance estimates for the inequality indices according to formulae provided \nby Biewen and Jenkins (2006) for GE indices and by Kova\u010devi\u0107 and Binder (1997) for the \n 12\nGini index. In both cases, we account for the clustering of individuals in households using a \nconventional sandwich estimator. The computations were undertaken using the Stata modules \nprovided by Biewen and Jenkins (2005) and Jenkins (2006). \n We checked whether our estimates of inequality trends were robust to the choice of \ninequality measure by investigating whether or not Lorenz curves of income distributions for \npairs of years do not intersect. The statistics of relevance for each year are the cumulative \nshares of income for different income groups for the sample ranked in ascending order of \nincome (the Lorenz ordinates), and their sampling variances. If there is Lorenz dominance, \nthen there is a unanimous ordering of income distributions according to all standard \ninequality indices (Foster 1985). These include the four indices mentioned in the previous \nparagraph. The computations of the distribution-free variance formulae provided by \nKova\u010devi\u0107 and Binder (1997) were undertaken using the Stata module provided by Jenkins \n(2006). Again we account for the clustering of individuals in households using a conventional \nsandwich estimator. \n Reiter (2003) provides a Bayesian derivation for his data combination inference \nformulae, and also the two conditions under which the inferences are valid from a frequentist \nperspective: that the analyst uses randomization valid estimators and that the synthetic data \ngeneration methods are proper in a sense similar to Rubin (1987). Of necessity we argue that \nthese conditions are satisfied in our case; it is impossible to test their validity since access to \nthe actual values for topcoded observations in the internal CPS data is not allowed. Reiter \ndeveloped his combination rules under the assumption that the producer of the multiply \nimputed partially synthetic data sets had used imputation methods that satisfy the conditions. \nOur imputation procedures are randomization based though not fully Bayesian since we did \nnot draw from the posterior predictive distribution of the GB2 parameters in each year. \nBecause of the complexity of implementing this procedure in our context, we drew from the \nfull data posterior distribution, treating the GB2 parameters as known and appeal to the \nexcellent fit of our GB2 models. An and Little (2007) employed the same procedure as ours \nwhen they derived multiple imputations for data assumed to follow a power-transformed \nnormal distribution. \n \n5. Estimates of U.S. income inequality, 1995\u20132004 \n \nWe first discuss the results from our analysis of Lorenz dominance and then the inequality \nindices. Throughout, tests for statistically significant differences are based on changes \n 13\nbetween distributions at least two years apart. We do not test for differences between adjacent \nyears because of the rotation group structure of the CPS (about half of the sample is the same \nin the March CPS for consecutive years): the test procedures we use are predicated on having \nindependent samples in each year. The focus is on the Internal-MI series, but supplemented \nby discussion of how the estimates from the Public-CM and Public-MI series compare. \nAlthough the latter two series under-estimate inequality measures and associated sampling \nvariances (as explained earlier), it is of interest to know whether these features lead to \nerroneous conclusions about inequality differences. \n Detailed results from the Lorenz dominance analysis of the Internal-MI data for the \nbeginning, middle and end of the period (1995, 2000, and 2004) are reported in Table 1. The \ndetails for the other years are not shown for brevity. Shown are the estimated Lorenz \nordinates (cumulative income shares) at each successive twentieth of the distributions, \ntogether with the estimated standard errors (in parentheses) derived using the methods \ndiscussed in the previous section. The rightmost three columns report distribution-free Lorenz \ndominance test statistics for pairwise comparisons between the three years. For a pairwise \ncomparison between year A and year B, and income group k = 1, \u2026, 19, each test statistic \n(\u0394k) is  \n( ) BkAkBkAkk VVLL \u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6 +\u2212=\u0394 , (9)\nwhere  is the estimate of the kth Lorenz ordinate,  is the estimate of its variance, and \ncorrespondingly for year B. Testing of the null hypothesis of dominance uses the multiple \ncomparison union-intersection method of Bishop et al. (1991a, 1991b) and Bishop et al. \n(1994). Tests are based on a 5% significance level and take account of the fact that each \ndominance test is based on 19 simultaneous tests. The critical value is therefore obtained \nfrom the Student maximum modulus distribution (Beach and Richmond 1985): SMM(19,\u221e) \n= 3.01.  \nA\nkL\u02c6\nA\nkV\u02c6\nThere are four possible outcomes from the tests associated with the comparison of \nyears A and B, as Bishop and colleagues explain. First, there may be no statistically \nsignificant difference between any pair of Lorenz ordinates (|\u0394k| \u2264 3.01 for all k), in which \ncase A and B cannot be differentiated. Second, if there are positive and statistically significant \ndifferences in ordinates and no negative and statistically significant differences, then A \nLorenz dominates B: inequality is lower according to all standard inequality indices (\u0394k > \n3.01 for some k and |\u0394l| \u2264 3.01 for l \u2260 k). Third, the reverse is the case if there are negative \n 14\n 15\nand statistically significant differences in ordinates and no positive and statistically \nsignificant differences (\u0394k < \u20133.01 for some k and |\u0394l| \u2264 3.01 for l \u2260 k). Fourth, if there are \nboth negative and positive differences that are statistically significant (\u0394k > 3.01 for some k \nand \u0394l < \u20133.01 for some l \u2260 k), the Lorenz curves cross and the null hypothesis of Lorenz \ndominance is rejected. For a review of this and other approaches to testing dominance, see \nDavidson and Duclos (2000). Some more recently proposed tests such as those of Barrett and \nDonald (2003) are not widely used and their more computationally intensive nature makes it \ninfeasible to apply them to CPS data in the restricted-access Census Research Data Center \nenvironment. \n Table 1 suggests that, according to the point estimates of the ordinates, the Lorenz \ncurve moved slightly outwards between 1995 and 2004 (indicating greater inequality). \nHowever, all the test statistics \u0394k are smaller than 3.01, and so we cannot differentiate \nbetween the pairs of Lorenz curves in question. For the two subperiods, the pattern of change \nin the ordinates is more complex \u2013 there are both positive and negative changes in the \nordinates \u2013 but the outcome is the same as before. Indeed, all 36 pairwise comparisons \nundertaken (using all pairs of years 1995\u20132004 excluding adjacent years) fall under the \nheading of the first cases. Thus, according to Lorenz dominance tests applied to multiply \nimputed internal data, no significant change in inequality according to all Lorenz-consistent \ninequality measures could be detected over the period 1995\u20132004.  \n We repeated the 36 pairwise Lorenz dominance tests using the Public-CM data and \nfound the same result, but with one difference. The null hypothesis of Lorenz dominance \ncould not be rejected for comparisons involving 1999 \u2013 inequality for this year was \napparently lower than for any of the other years considered. For example, in the comparison \nbetween 1999 and 2004, \u0394k > 3.01 for k = 12 to 19 inclusive, and 0 < \u0394k < 3.01 otherwise. \nThat is, cumulative income shares were significantly lower in the top third of the income \ndistribution in 2004 compared to 1999. Apart from the results for 1999, there is consistency \nbetween the conclusions derived from the Internal-MI and Public-CM series. We discuss why \n1999 is different below. \n Lorenz dominance tests based on the Public-MI data led to slightly different results. \nThere was less inequality in 1999 than in 1995 and in 1996. But, besides the results for this \nyear, there is broad consistency between these estimates and those from the Internal-MI \nseries. \n \nTable 1.

Estimates of \ninequality indices and test statistics for pairwise comparisons for selected years are shown in \nTable 2 for the Internal-MI series. The test statistics are for pairwise difference-in-means t-\ntests, and so the relevant critical value using a 5% significance level is approximately 1.96. \nWe find that the estimate of each index increased between 1995 and 2000 and between 2000 \nand 2004. The estimated increase between 1995 and 2004 is largest for the GE(2) and GE(0) \nindices (25% and 18%, respectively), and smallest for the Gini and GE(1) indices (3% and \n9%, respectively). However it is only for the Gini and GE(0) indices that the increases are \nstatistically different from zero. Few subperiod increases are statistically significant either \u2013 \nthe exceptions mainly concern GE(0). Observe that the standard errors for the GE(2) index \nare relatively large, and we comment further on this below. \n \nTable 2.

Source: authors\u2019 calculations from internal CPS data. \n \n \nThe complete set of tests for pairwise inequality index differences are summarized in \nTable 3 for all three series. For each year, inequality index, and data source series, the cell \nentry shows the year(s) for which there is a statistically significant difference in inequality \nbetween the comparison year (column 1) and the year(s) shown. A blank cell means no \ncomparison between that year and any other year is statistically significant. The table points \nto several findings about inequality differences and about consistency in results across series. \n First, according to the gold standard of the Internal-MI series, few inequality \ndifferences are significantly different from zero. Where they are statistically significant, they \n 17\n 18\ntypically refer to differences between the beginning of the period and the end of the period. \nThe greatest number of statistically significant differences refer to the GE(0) index. Also, \nnone of the tests for differences in the top-sensitive index GE(2) based on the Internal-MI \nseries are statistically significant.  \n Second, we find more statistically significant differences using the Public-CM series \nthan the Internal-MI series. For some reference years when comparisons based on the \nInternal-MI series yield no statistically significant differences at all, there are statistically \nsignificant differences according to the Public-CM series. Consider, for example, the \ncomparisons for each of the reference years 1997, 1999 and 2000 for the Gini and GE(1) \nindices, and all comparisons for GE(2) except those involving 1998. And, whenever there is \nany statistically significant difference concerning a year A and a year B according to the \nInternal-MI series, there are often statistically significant differences between year A and \nadditional years as well according to the other two series. For example, according to the \nInternal-MI series, there was a statistically significant difference between the Gini indices for \n2004 and 1995. According to the Public-CM series, the Gini index for 2004 differed from the \nestimates for 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. In only a few instances was there a \nstatistically significant difference according to the Internal-MI series but not the Public-CM \none, notably the GE(0) comparisons for 2001 with 1997 and 1998, and 2002 with 1999. \n The explanation for these findings is that the suppression of genuine within-cell \nincome dispersion that is associated with cell mean imputation leads to underestimation of \nnot only inequality indices but also of their sampling variances. There is therefore a tendency \nfor estimated inequality trends based on the Public-CM series to be judged statistically \nsignificant when they are not. \n \n \n \n \nTable 3.

This shows the \nestimates for each of the four inequality indices, year by year, together with the associated \n95% confidence intervals. To ensure the lower bound of the confidence interval for GE(2) is \npositive, the interval for this index was calculated in the logarithmic metric and then \ntransformed back to the natural metric.  \nUnsurprisingly, estimates of inequality levels in each year are greater for the Internal-\nMI series than for the Public-CM series. However, both series point to similar trends over the \nperiod: they suggest that inequality levels fell slightly at the end of the 1990s, especially \nbetween 1998 and 1999, and again between 2001 and 2002. This consistency appears \nreassuring for analysts, especially since all researchers have access to cell mean-augmented \npublic use CPS data whereas access to internal CPS data is subject to special conditions.  \n \n.35\n.4\n.45\n.5\nG\nin\ni\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nGini\n.35\n.4\n.45\n.5\nG\nE\n(0\n)\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nGE(0)\n.25\n.3\n.35\n.4\n.45\n.5\nG\nE\n(1\n)\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nGE(1)\n0\n.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\nG\nE\n(2\n)\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nGE(2)\n \nFigure 3.

Internal-MI series \n(solid line), Public-CM series (long-dashed line), and Public-MI series (short-dashed line), \nderived from internal and public use CPS data. \n \nHowever, Figure 3 also clearly shows that confidence intervals for inequality indices \nestimated using the Public-CM data are too narrow by a substantial amount. This feature is \nparticularly striking for the top-sensitive GE(2) index, which is not surprising because it is at \nthe very top of the distribution that the data series differ in dispersion. In short, the reassuring \n 20\nconsistency between the Internal-MI and Public-CM series evaporates if the researcher is \ninterested in statistical inference and not simply point estimates. \nFor the GE(2) index, the very wide confidence intervals in the Internal-MI series are \nlikely to reflect the GE(2)\u2019s relatively greater non-robustness to the effects of outliers in the \nsense discussed by Cowell and Victoria-Feser (1996). Although their discussion focuses on \npoint estimates of inequality indices rather than sampling variances, the same points apply. In \nthe GE(2) case, sampling variances depend on fourth order moments, so high income outliers \nhave a large impact. The averaging process used to combine the estimates from our 100 \nmultiply imputed data sets appears to offset the effects on GE(2) estimates of any outliers \nadded by the imputation process, but does not do so for GE(2) sampling variances. This non-\nrobustness problem does not arise with the other inequality indices, however.  \n The Public-MI estimate for any given year and index lies between the corresponding \nInternal-MI and Public-CM estimate, and is generally closer to the latter rather than the \nformer. There are a few exceptional cases in which the Public-MI estimate is slightly smaller \nthan the Public-CM estimate, most of which involve the estimates for 1995 or 1996. Our \nexplanation for lower inequality in the Public-MI series than the Internal-MI one is that the \nimputation model underlying the Public-MI series does not work as well as the model \nunderlying the Internal-MI series and this, in turn, is related to the substantially greater \nprevalence of topcoded data in the public use data compared to the internal data. It is the \nsame feature that leads to confidence intervals that are smaller than for Internal-MI series. \nThey are, however, larger than for the Public-CM series as the construction of the Public-MI \nseries incorporates more variability via its imputation process. Our explanation for the \nPublic-MI estimates being relatively close to the Public-CM one is that derivation of the \nPublic-MI series did not use any information from the internal data, whereas the Public-CM \nseries did. The impetus to inequality that is added by the randomization process in the \nderivation of the former source is matched by the use of information about actual incomes \nfrom the internal data in the latter source. \nThe final feature of Figure 3 that we wish to comment on is the results for 1999. \nRelative to trend, this appears to be an outlier year, and echoes results from the Lorenz \ndominance analysis reported earlier. Interestingly, the index estimates for 1999 are above \nthose for immediately previous and succeeding years according to the Public-MI series, but \nbelow them according to the other two series. Indeed, if the results for 1999 were discarded, \nthe trends for the three series would look much more similar. We do not have a complete \nexplanation for the exceptional 1999 results. We rule out differences in the imputation \n 21\nprocess for the public data for that year, because we can see no clear differences between the \nparameter estimates of the GB2 model for 1999 and those for the years before and afterwards. \nAnd the computer code used to implement the imputation randomization process is generic. \nSince the Internal-MI and Public-CM series both rely on internal data for their derivation, \nwhereas the Public-MI series does not, we suspect that there is some feature of the internal \ndata for that year that underlies the pattern. \n \n \n6. Discussion \n \nWe have demonstrated how a multiple imputation approach may be used to estimate \ninequality levels and trends from right censored income data. With a suitable imputation \nmodel, researchers may impute values to topcoded observations, thereby creating multiple \npartially synthetic data sets to be analyzed using complete data methods. Estimates combined \nusing straightforward formulae can be used for statistical inference.  \n Applying the multiple imputation approach to internal data from the CPS, we have \nshown that no clear cut conclusions about the changes in income inequality over the period \nbetween 1995 and 2004 can be drawn. According to Lorenz dominance analysis, there was no \nsignificant change in inequality. For some specific indices, such as the Gini or the GE(0), \nthere was a statistically significant increase in inequality between 1995 and 2004; for more \ntop-sensitive indices such as GE(1) and GE(2), changes did not differ significantly from zero.  \n Our analysis enables assessment of the public use CPS data augmented by the Census \nBureau\u2019s cell mean imputations for topcoded observations in the context of estimation of \nincome inequality and its trends. Taking the estimates from the multiply imputed internal data \nas the gold standard shows that the cell mean-augmented data track trends in inequality \nindices over the decade since 1995 reasonably well, though inequality levels are \u2013 \nunsurprisingly \u2013 underestimated. However, we have also shown that suppression of income \ndispersion within cells, combined with use of right censored CPS internal data to construct \ncell means, also has impacts on variance estimates. Compared to their multiply imputed \ninternal data counterparts, they are underestimated, leading to confidence intervals that are \ntoo narrow and a tendency to incorrectly find statistically significant inequality differences. \nPut another way, cell mean imputations for topcoded observations may do an excellent job of \nhelping to estimate mean incomes, but their very nature makes them less suitable for \nestimation and inference concerning statistics based on higher order moments. \n 22\n Although few researchers would find it practical to go through the procedures \nrequired to access the internal CPS data, and to undertake the research using the data within a \nU.S. Census Bureau Data Center, we have shown that there is a feasible alternative that \nworks reasonably well. That is, our comparisons of the three series shows a multiple \nimputation approach applied to topcoded public use CPS data can yield results about income \ninequality that in several senses lie between those derived using multiple imputation applied \nto internal data and those derived using cell-mean augmented public use data. The Public-MI \napproach takes account of income dispersion at the top of the distribution and also takes \naccount of the variability of estimates. Because the public use data are, by definition, in the \npublic domain, it would also be easier for researchers to build more sophisticated imputation \nmodels and improve the quality of estimates derived. These models might allow for subgroup \ndifferences, for instance allowing for covariates in the estimation of a parametric model or \nalso incorporating the information available from the cell mean imputations. As argued in the \nIntroduction, the multiple imputation methods we propose may be applied to a number of \ndatasets other than the CPS. The methods might also be applied to the case of interval \ncensoring, i.e. when income data are provided in grouped form. Imputing a value equal to the \nmidpoint of an interval is a commonly-used single imputation approach (see e.g. Kahn 1998); \nmultiple imputation may be a fruitful alternative. \n \n \nReferences \nAn, D. and Little, R.
