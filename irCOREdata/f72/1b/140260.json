On the one hand, high unemployment rates may lead to start-up activity of self-employed\nindividuals (the \u201crefugee\u201d effect). On the other hand, higher rates of self-employment may indi-\ncate increased entrepreneurial activity reducing unemployment in subsequent periods (the \u201centre-\npreneurial\u201d effect). This paper introduces a new two-equation vector autoregression model capa-\nble of reconciling these ambiguities and estimates it for data from 23 OECD countries between\n1974 and 2002. The empirical results confirm the existence of two distinct relationships between\nunemployment and self-employment: the \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effects. We also find\nthat the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effects are considerably stronger than the \u201crefugee\u201d effects.\n3INTRODUCTION\nLinking unemployment to self-employment dates to at least Oxenfeldt (1943), who argues that\nindividuals confronted with unemployment and low prospects for wage-employment will turn to\nself-employment as a viable alternative. This is an extension of Knight\u2019s (1921) view that indi-\nviduals decide between three states \u2013 unemployment, self-employment and employment. Al-\nthough the actual decision is shaped by the relative prices of these three activities, implied is the\nprediction of a positive correlation between self-employment and unemployment. This simple\ntheory of income choice has been the basis for a range of studies focusing on the decision of indi-\nviduals to become self-employed (Parker, 2004; Grilo and Thurik, 2005; Grilo and Irigoyen,\n2006). Specifically, this theory suggests that increasing unemployment leads to increasing start-\nup activity because the opportunity cost of starting a firm has decreased (Blau, 1987; Evans and\nJovanovic, 1989; Evans and Leighton, 1990; Blanchflower and Meyer, 1994). This effect has\nbeen referred to as the unemployment push, refugee or desperation effect. There is, however, an\nimportant counterargument to this theory: The unemployed tend to possess lower endowments of\nthe human capital and entrepreneurial talent needed to start and sustain a new firm. This, in turn,\nwould suggest that high unemployment may be associated with a low degree of self-employment.\nHigh unemployment rates may also imply lower levels of personal wealth which also reduce the\nlikelihood of becoming self-employed (Johansson, 2000; Hurst and Lusardi, 2004). Lastly, high\nunemployment rates may correlate with stagnant economic growth leading to fewer entrepreneu-\nrial opportunities (Audretsch, 1995; Audretsch, Thurik, Verheul and Wennekers, 2002).\nThe counterarguments above suggest that entrepreneurial opportunities are not just the re-\nsult of the push effect (the threat) of unemployment but also of the pull effect produced by a\nthriving economy as well as by past entrepreneurial activities. Indeed, while some scholars argue\nthat unemployment influences start-up activity, others claim that the reverse holds true. Firm\nstart-ups hire employees, resulting in subsequent decreases in unemployment (Lin, Manser and\nPicot, 1998; Pfeiffer and Reize, 2000). Furthermore, increased entrepreneurial activity may influ-\nence country-wide economic performance (van Stel, Carree and Thurik, 2005). For example, en-\ntrepreneurs enter markets with new products or production processes (Acs and Audretsch, 2003).\nThey also increase productivity by increasing competition (Geroski, 1989; Nickell, 1996; Nickell,\nNicolitsas and Dryden, 1997). They also improve our knowledge of what is technically viable;\nwhat consumers prefer; and of how to acquire the necessary resources by introducing variations\nof existing products and services in the market. The resulting learning process speeds up finding\nthe dominant design of product-market combinations. This learning does not just come from ex-\n4perimenting entrepreneurs: Knowledge spillovers play also an important role (Audretsch and\nKeilbach, 2004). Lastly, entrepreneurs are inclined to work longer hours and more efficiently as\ntheir income is closely related to their working effort. (See Carree and Thurik (2003) for a survey\nof the (positive) effects of entrepreneurship on economic growth.) A counterargument to this\nview points out that low survival rates combined with the limited growth of most small firms im-\nplies that the employment contribution of start-ups is very low. As Geroski (1995) has docu-\nmented, the penetration rate, or employment share, of new-firm start-ups is remarkably low. In\nother words, the contribution of entrepreneurial activities to the reduction of unemployment is\nvery limited at best.\nThe available empirical evidence, unfortunately, presents similar ambiguities and reflects\nthese two conflicting theories. Some studies have found that unemployment is associated with\nincreased entrepreneurial activities while others have found that entrepreneurial activity and un-\nemployment are inversely related (Thurik, 1999). Evans and Leighton (1990), for example, found\nthat unemployment is positively associated with the propensity to start new firms, but Garofoli\n(1994) as well as Audretsch and Fritsch (1994) found that unemployment is negatively related to\nfirm start-up.1 Carree (2002) found no statistically significant relationship between unemploy-\nment and the number of establishments. In reviewing early empirical evidence relating unem-\nployment rates to new-firm start-up activity, Storey (1991, p. 177) concludes, \u201cThe broad consen-\nsus is that time series analyses point to unemployment being, ceteris paribus, positively associ-\nated with indices of new-firm formation, whereas cross sectional, or pooled cross sectional stud-\nies appear to indicate the reverse. Attempts to reconcile these differences have not been wholly\nsuccessful.\u201d Audretsch and Thurik (2000) present empirical evidence that an increase in the num-\nber of business owners reduces the unemployment rate. They identify an \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect\nin terms of the positive impact on employment from new firm entry. However, Blanchflower\n(2000), examining OECD countries, finds no positive impact of self-employment rates on GDP\ngrowth. Carree, van Stel, Thurik and Wennekers (2002 and 2007) suggest that countries with\nrelatively low self-employment rates benefit from increased self-employment in terms of GDP\ngrowth, but that countries with relatively high self-employment rates do not.\nConsequently, there are not just theoretical reasons, but also empirical evidence, albeit con-\ntested, that while unemployment causes increased self-employment, self-employment causes re-\nduced unemployment. Unravelling the relationship between self-employment and unemployment\n1 Other studies showing that greater unemployment serves as a catalyst for start-up activity include Reynolds, Miller and Maki,\n1995; Reynolds, Storey and Westhead, 1994; Hamilton, 1989; Highfield and Smiley, 1987; Yamawaki, 1990; and Evans and\nLeighton, 1989 and 1990.\n5is crucial because policy is frequently based on assumptions that do not reflect the described am-\nbiguities. The purpose of the present paper is to try and reconcile the ambiguities found in the re-\nlationship between unemployment and start-up activity. We do this by introducing a simple two-\nequation vector autoregression model where changes in unemployment and self-employment are\nlinked to subsequent changes in those variables for a panel of 23 OECD countries.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. We start by providing additional background\non the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect and present an algebraic model which forms the basis for our re-\ngression exercises. In the following sections the algebraic model is extended to a two-equation\nvector autoregression (VAR) model, which will be used to test the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201crefu-\ngee\u201d effects. We also present the data and methodology employed to estimate the VAR model.\nFinally, in the last two sections we discuss the estimation results and draw conclusions.\nLINKING SELF-EMPLOYMENT TO UNEMPLOYMENT\nAs discussed previously, there may be both a (positive) effect of unemployment on self-\nemployment (the \u201crefugee\u201d effect) and a (negative) effect of self-employment on unemployment\n(the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect). And both possibilities have been studied theoretically and empiri-\ncally. The \u201centrepreneurial effect,\u201d however, requires some further analysis.\nWhy an increased amount of entrepreneurial activity should have an impact on unemploy-\nment? The economics literature on Gibrat\u2019s Law provides one approach to address this question.\nGibrat\u2019s Law states that firm growth is independent of firm size. Thus, Gibrat\u2019s Law implies that\nshifting employment from large to small enterprises should have no impact on total employment,\nsince the expected growth rates of both types of firms are identical. And, as a result, restructuring\nthe economy from large to small enterprises (including the self-employed) should have no impact\non the overall unemployment rate.\nHowever, there is strong and systematic empirical evidence suggesting that, in fact, Gi-\nbrat\u2019s Law does not hold across a broad spectrum of firm sizes. Sutton (1997) and Caves (1998)\nhave produced two comprehensive and exhaustive compilations of studies relating firm size to\ngrowth and have shown that stylised fact (as Geroski (1995) puts it) that smaller firms have\ngreater growth rates than their larger counterparts. Beginning with the pioneering studies by Ev-\nans (1987a and 1987b) and Hall (1987), along with Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988 and\n1989), a central finding of this literature is that firm growth is negatively related to firm size and\n6age.2 These findings have been confirmed in virtually every subsequent study undertaken, despite\ndifferences in country, time period, industry, and methodology used. The evidence strongly sup-\nports the claim that very young and very small firms outperform their older and larger counter-\nparts in terms of employment creation even when corrected for their higher probabilities of exit.\nSome studies indicated that age and size effects disappear as firms\u2019 age and employment increase\n(Hart and Oulton, 1999).\nThe literature described above uses micro level data and shows that small firms grow faster\nthan large firms. This suggests that, at the macro or country level, a larger presence of small firms\ncontributes positively to economic performance as well. Self-employment rates represent a spe-\ncific measure of the presence of small and very small firms in an economy. However, it is not\nclear that higher self-employment rates automatically lead to improved economic performance. In\nfact, self-employment rates in some countries may be inefficiently high (Carree, van Stel, Thurik\nand Wennekers, 2002 and 2007). Too much self-employment can be characteristic of poor\neconomies of scale in production and R&D rather than of vibrant entrepreneurial activity. Within\nthis context, Carree et al. have introduced a model where an \u2018optimal\u2019 level of self-employment,\n*\niE , is assumed to exist for each country i, dependent on its stage of economic development. The\nlevel *iE is optimal in the sense that both a level of self-employment iE lower than\n*\niE and a\nlevel of self-employment higher than *iE leads to a lower rate of economic growth compared to a\nsituation where iE equals\n*\niE . In the first case, competition levels are too low, while in the sec-\nond case, economies of scale and scope are not fully utilised.3\nSimilarly to their work, in the present paper we assume that the unemployment rate itU in\ncountry i and period t is positively affected by the extent to which the self-employment rate 1, \uf02dtiE\nis different from the country-specific optimal rate (in terms of employment creation), *iE . The\nunemployment rate is equal to the level oitU that would be present in case the actual self-\nemployment rate would be equal to the optimal rate ( *1, iti EE \uf03d\uf02d ) plus a penalty determined by the\nabsolute difference between 1, \uf02dtiE and\n*\niE :\n(1) *it,i\no\nitit EEUU \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d1\uf056 ,\n2 See Klomp, Santarelli and Thurik (2006) for a survey of the empirical literature.\n3 Carree, van Stel, Thurik and Wennekers (2002) provide empirical support for this model using a data set which is similar to the\none used in the present analysis.\n7where 0\uf03e\uf056 .

The optimal self-employment rates\nare determined by institutional and socio-economic factors and, hence, only change very slowly\nover time. Therefore, there are three relevant cases for the relation between the self-employment\nrate and the country-specific optimal rate. First, both the self-employment rate in period t-1 and t-\n2 are higher than the optimal rate (case 3a). Second, they are both less than the optimal rate (case\n3b). Third, one is higher than the optimal rate and one is lower, while both are relatively close to\nthe optimal rate (case 3c): *2,1, ititi EEE \uf0bb\uf0bb \uf02d\uf02d . Depending upon the case, equation (2) changes as\nfollows:\n(3a) ittiititiiti EUEEEE \uf065\uf056 \uf02b\uf044\uf03d\uf044\uf03e\uf0d9\uf03e \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 1,\n*\n2,\n*\n1, : ,\n(3b) ittiititiiti EUEEEE \uf065\uf056 \uf02b\uf044\uf02d\uf03d\uf044\uf03c\uf0d9\uf03c \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 1,\n*\n2,\n*\n1, : ,\n(3c) itittiititiiti UEEEEEE \uf065\uf0bb\uf044\uf03c\uf03c\uf0da\uf03e\uf03e \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d :2,\n*\n1,2,\n*\n1, .\n4\nEquations (3a) through (3c) show that the sign of the coefficient of 1, \uf02d\uf044 tiE reflects whether,\non average for the countries under consideration, the self-employment rate is below, above or\nabout equal to the optimal level. When the coefficient is positive, the self-employment rate is too\nhigh (case 3a), while if the coefficient is negative, then the self-employment rate is too low (case\n3b). In case there is no effect of 1, \uf02d\uf044 tiE on itU\uf044 then the self-employment rate should be close to\nthe optimal level (case 3c).5 We use equation (4) to test for the effect:\n(4) \uf028 \uf029 ittititiit EEUU \uf065\uf062 \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 2,1,1, .\nThe effect of self-employment rates on unemployment rates is the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect\nof increased entrepreneurial activity contributing to lower unemployment rates. The coefficient\n\uf062 can be either positive or negative, while the coefficient \uf056 introduced in equation (1) must be\npositive. The expected sign of \uf062 is negative though. That is, we expect that, for the majority of\ncountries in our data base, self-employment levels are below optimum (case 3b) so that an in-\n4 See Audretsch, Carree, van Stel and Thurik (2002) for a similar approach relating economic growth to small firm presence in 17\nEuropean countries.\n5 The intuition is that in case the actual self-employment rate changes from just below the optimal level to just above, or the other\nway around, this change has no net positive or negative effect on economic performance, here the rate of unemployment.\n8crease of self-employment results in a subsequent decrease in unemployment. We supplement our\nmain equation (4) with the complementary equation relating the change of the unemployment rate\nto the subsequent change in the self-employment rate:\n(5) \uf028 \uf029 ittititiit UUEE \uf068\uf06c \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 2,1,1,\nThe effect of unemployment rates on self-employment rates is the push (\u201crefugee\u201d) effect\nof recently unemployed workers starting their own venture to escape unemployment. Coefficient\n\uf06c is expected to be positive.\nThe ambiguity in the relationship between self-employment and unemployment is reflected\nby the opposite (expected) signs of the parameters in equations (4) and (5). We expect \uf062 to be\nnegative but \uf06c to be positive. Hence, although there is both a positive and a negative association\nbetween self-employment and unemployment, the model formed by equations (4) and (5) enables\nus to unravel the complex relationship. In the model and method section equations (4) and (5)\nwill be extended to a simple VAR-model, which will be estimated using a data base of 23 OECD\ncountries over the period 1974-2002.6 Also, although the period length is left undefined in the\nmathematical version of the model, in our empirical application, one period is defined as four\nyears.\nMEASUREMENT ISSUES\nFollowing Storey (1991), we operationalize entrepreneurial activity in terms of the number of\nself-employed. More precisely, we use the change in the number of non-agricultural self-\nemployed (unincorporated as well as incorporated) as a fraction of the labour force. This measure\nhas two significant advantages: First, while not being a direct measure of entrepreneurship, it is a\nuseful and well-established proxy for entrepreneurial activity (Storey, 1991). Second, it is avail-\nable for a large number of countries and, after applying appropriate harmonizations (van Stel,\n2005), it can be compared across countries and over time. Of course, some important qualifica-\ntions should be emphasized when using and interpreting this variable. First, the variable com-\nbines heterogeneous activities across a broad spectrum of sectors and contexts into one single\nmeasure. This measure treats all businesses as the same, both high- and low-tech. Second, the\ndata are not weighted for magnitude or impact: all self-employed businesses are identically\n6 Note that equations (4) and (5) are in first differences, so that country-specific effects are differenced out. It is obvious that the\nrate of new venture formation is country-specific since for example entrepreneurial traits may be culture-dependent (Mueller\nand Thomas, 2000, and Shane, Kolvereid and Westhead, 1991).\n9measured, even though some clearly have a greater impact than others. Third, this variable meas-\nures the relative change in the stock of self-employed businesses and not new start-ups.7\nThe panel data set of unemployment and self-employment rates for the 23 OECD countries\nfor the 1974-2002 period is constructed as follows: For the unemployment data, U, we use the\nstandardized unemployment rate of the OECD Main Economic Indicators. The data for self-\nemployment, E, are from the Compendia 2002.1 data set of EIM in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands.\nThe Compendia data set uses data from the OECD Labour Force Statistics and other (country-\nspecific) sources to make the self-employment data as comparable as possible across countries\nand over time.8 The data in Compendia are available on a bi-annual (even years only) basis. Be-\ncause our focus in the current paper is the effect of self-employment on unemployment, in Table\n1 we show some data of the six country\/period combinations (out of 46) with the highest and\nlowest values of the change in the self-employment rate from 1978 to 1986 and from 1986 to\n1994. Out of six countries with the strongest increase in self-employment five show a subsequent\ndecrease in unemployment. Italy is the exception.9 Out of six countries with the strongest de-\ncrease in self-employment five show a subsequent increase in unemployment. Portugal, with a\nsubstantial net inflow of EU funds (\u2018Cohesion Funds\u2019) which probably exerts a downward pres-\nsure on unemployment rates, is the exception.\nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nMODEL AND METHOD\nThe previous sections explain why the dynamic interrelationship between changes in self-\nemployment and unemployment is complex, and, in particular, why the direction of causality be-\n7 Basically, our measure of change in self-employment rate is a measure of net entry of entrepreneurs (i.e. the number of entrepre-\nneurs starting a new business in a given period minus the number of entrepreneurs closing their business). Indeed, our meas-\nure of net changes in self-employment may or may not correlate with (gross) measures of entrepreneurial activity available\nfrom other sources. For instance, the correlation between the change in the self-employment rate over the period 2002-2004\nand the Total-early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) Index 2004 of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is 0.374 (p-\nvalue 0.105; correlation based on 20 countries). See Acs, Arenius, Hay and Minniti (2005). Note that correlations may not be\nhigh as our measure is a net measure of entrepreneurial activity and not a gross measure. For example, in the US economy\nboth entry and exit levels are relatively high. However, the net change in the self-employment rate has been relatively low in\nthe last decades.\n8 In Compendia, self-employment rates are defined as the number of non-agricultural self-employed (unincorporated as well as\nincorporated), as a fraction of total labor force. The harmonizations mainly concern corrections for the number of incorpo-\nrated self-employed (harmonization across countries) and corrections for trend breaks (harmonization over time). The 23\ncountries included in Compendia are the (old) EU-15 as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, USA, Japan, Canada, Austral-\nia and New Zealand. See van Stel (2005) for details about the Compendia data base.\n9 Italy has a very high self-employment rate, approaching 20% in the first decade of the 21st Century. Further increases in this rate\nmay be counter-productive (Carree, van Stel, Thurik and Wennekers, 2002). On the other hand, the strong decrease in unem-\nployment in Ireland between 1994 and 2002 cannot entirely be attributed to the increase in self-employment between 1986\nand 1994. The strong economic performance of Ireland can also be attributed to factors like foreign direct investments and\nEuropean Union subsidies. The Netherlands is an example of a country with decreasing self-employment rates (-0.5 % point\nbetween 1978 and 1986) and subsequently decreasing unemployment rates (-3.6 % point between 1986 and 1994). The ap-\npraised Dutch \u2018Poldermodel\u2019, which was launched by the 1982 Wassenaar Treaty between employers\u2019 organizations and un-\nions, is an important reason for the huge decrease in unemployment during the late 1980s and the 1990s in The Netherlands\n(Thurik, 1999). Therefore, entrepreneurial activity is not the only route to achieving low unemployment rates.\n10\ntween the two variables is not clear a priori. The previous sections suggest two testable hypothe-\nses \u2013 that increases in self-employment rates lead to a decrease in subsequent unemployment, and\nthat increases in unemployment rates lead to an increase in subsequent self-employment. In order\nto evaluate the causal linkages involved in the relationship, the most natural way of testing these\ntwo hypotheses is to estimate a vector autoregression (VAR) model (for example, see Sims,\n1980). This means that a vector of dependent variables is explained by one or more lags of the\nvector of dependent variables, i.e. each dependent variable is explained by one or more lags of\nitself and of the other dependent variables.10\nIn our application, we have a two equation VAR model with the change in unemployment\nand the change in self-employment as dependent variables. Equations (4) and (5) are extended in\nthree respects in order to obtain a testable empirical model. First, we include lagged dependent\nvariables on the right hand side in the VAR model to test for the direction of causality. We will\nreport Granger-causality test statistics when discussing our results.11 Second, we allow for multi-\nple time lags as the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201crefugee\u201d effects may come with a lag and we do not\nknow a priori how long this lag may be. Third, we use time dummies as additional explanatory\nvariables. These dummies correct for business cycle effects over the sample period for the coun-\ntries covered by our dataset. The model reads as follows:\n(6) it\nT\nt\nttLjtijLti\nJ\nj\njLjtijLti\nJ\nj\njLtiit DUUEEUU 1\n1\n)1(,,\n1\n)1(,,\n1\n, )()( \uf065\uf064\uf067\uf062\uf061 \uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02d\n(7) it\nT\nt\nttLjtijLti\nJ\nj\njLjtijLti\nJ\nj\njLtiit DEEUUEE 2\n1\n)1(,,\n1\n)1(,,\n1\n, )()( \uf065\uf06e\uf06d\uf06c\uf06b \uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02d ,\nwhere i is a country-index, L is the time span in number of years, J is the number of time lags in-\ncluded, Dt are time dummies and it1\uf065 and it2\uf065 are possibly correlated error terms. The expected\nsign of the joint impact of the \uf062 coefficients is negative and the expected sign of the joint impact\nof the \uf06c coefficients is positive.\nUsing the panel data set consisting of 23 OECD countries between 1974-2002, equations\n(6) and (7) are estimated using weighted least squares. We consider changes in self-employment\n10 Note that, because the same list of independent variables appears in both equations, OLS and SUR estimation are identical: it is\nnot necessary to take into account possible correlation between the two error terms.\n11 Equations (6) and (7) can be used for testing Granger-causality. The Granger (1969) approach to the question of whether x\ncauses y is to establish how much of the current y can be explained by past values of y and then to establish whether adding\nlagged values of x can improve the explanation. y is said to be Granger-caused by x if x helps in the prediction of y, or equiva-\nlently if the coefficients on the lagged x\u2019s are statistically significant. This can be tested using a simple F-test on the lagged\nx\u2019s.\n11\nand unemployment over periods of four years, i.e. L equals 4.12 Furthermore, we test for the\nnumber of time lags, in order to gain insight into the lag structure between unemployment and\nself-employment. Inclusion of more lags seems relevant because the employment impact of en-\ntrepreneurial ventures is not instantaneous: it requires a number of years for the firm to grow. In\nthis respect Geroski (1995, p. 148) notes that \u201cEven successful entrants may take more than a\ndecade to achieve a size comparable to the average incumbent.\u201d Beesley and Hamilton (1984)\npoint at the seedbed role of new and small firms challenging incumbent firms. The essentially\ninnovative seedbed activities, with the inevitable trial and error (birth and death) mechanism, may\ntake a long time to cause the \u2018creative destruction\u2019 of incumbent enterprise, the emergence of new\nenterprise and subsequent growth. Audretsch (1995) shows that the share of total employment\naccounted for by a cohort of new-firm start-ups in U.S. manufacturing more than doubles as the\nfirms age from two to six years.\nRather than imposing a lag structure for the impact of the lagged variables in equations (6)\nand (7), we test for the statistically most adequate lag structure by using likelihood ratio tests. We\nstart by including only one lag, and then, one lag at a time, we include further lags until the like-\nlihood ratio test rejects inclusion of further lags. In terms of equations (6) and (7), this procedure\ndetermines the value of J. We avoid using data for overlapping periods as this may cause a\ndownward bias in the estimated standard errors of the coefficients. In other words, given that we\nchose L equal to 4, this implies that we use data for 2002, 1998, 1994, \u2026, 1974.\nEMPIRICAL RESULTS\nEstimation results for the two-equation VAR model consisting of equations (6) and (7) are re-\nported in Table 2.13\n12 Given that our data are available on a bi-annual basis, the minimum lag length is two years. However, if we measure the vari-\nables over two-year periods, chances are that two consecutive periods fall within the same business cycle. An important dis-\nadvantage then is that the lagged dependent variable dominates the regression outcomes. Regressions using L =2 are avail-\nable upon request. With the exception of Model Ia, these produced R2-values considerably lower than the values reported in\nthe upper half of Table 2.\n13 Before starting our regression analysis we tested whether the dependent variables in our model are stationary. In particular, we\ntested for unit roots using the Dickey-Fuller method (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and found no evidence for a unit root. More\nspecifically we applied a t-test for \uf072 in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression\ntptpttt yyyty \uf065\uf06c\uf06c\uf072\uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf044\uf02b\uf02b\uf044\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\uf044 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d )1(44144144 ... where ty is the four-year change in unemployment or\nself-employment, t is a time trend, and \uf072 is the order of the autoregressive (AR) process. For each dependent variable we\nran nine variants, assuming AR processes of order one, two or three, and assuming that the AR process has no constant and\nno trend (i.e. 0\uf03d\uf03d \uf062\uf061 ), a constant but no trend ( 0\uf03d\uf062 ) or both a constant and a trend. The t-values for \uf072 varied from -\n6.6 to -14.3 for the change in unemployment series, and from -4.2 to -8.2 for the change in self-employment series. As these\nvalues are well below the (negative) critical values, the null hypothesis of a unit root was rejected. Note that this is in line\nwith expectations given that our dependent variables are in first differences.\n12\nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\nAs explained above, initially we include only one lag of the dependent variables (Model\nIa). We compute the coefficients using the largest possible sample, given the lag structure. As the\noldest year in the data set is 1974 and using one lag implies going back eight years, we can use\ndata for 1982, 1986, up to 2002. For each year we have 23 countries, which gives us 138 observa-\ntions in Model Ia. From the results for equation (6) we find that changes in self-employment have\na significantly negative impact on unemployment in the subsequent period. Indeed, the Granger-\ncausality test indicates that self-employment causes unemployment to decrease (p-value below\n0.05). From the results for equation (7), we see that in Model Ia, unemployment does not\nGranger-cause self-employment to increase.\nHowever, results using Model Ia may be biased because our lag structure is too restrictive.\nAs previously noted, considerable lags may be involved in the relationship. To test this we in-\nclude a second lag, representing changes in unemployment or self-employment between t-12 and\nt-8 (basically an eight year lag). Using the extra lag implies that we lose a year in our sample,\nhence the model is estimated for 115 observations (Model IIa). We apply a likelihood ratio test to\nsee whether including the extra lag improves the statistical fit of the model. For this purpose we\nre-compute the one lag model using the 115 observations sample (Model Ib). Testing Model IIa\nagainst Model Ib gives a likelihood ratio test statistic of 24.0. As the critical value at 5% level is\n9.5 (four restrictions), it implies that a model using two lags is to be preferred over a model using\none lag. Analogously, testing Model III against Model IIb we conclude that adding a third lag to\nthe model does not improve the statistical fit. Hence, we conclude that model variants using two\nlags are statistically superior. Focusing on the results of Models IIa and IIb, we find that self-\nemployment Granger-causes unemployment to decrease, and also that unemployment Granger-\ncauses self-employment (p-values below 0.05 in all four cases) to increase.\nFrom the signs of the coefficients and t-values in Models IIa and IIb it appears that entre-\npreneurial activity, as hypothesized, reduces unemployment but that the impact appears after an\neight year lag. The positive effect of unemployment on self-employment seems to capitalize\nsomewhat faster. However, given the interrelationship between the two variables in the model, a\nmore insightful way to capture the impact is to use impulse response functions. These functions\ncapture and compute the impact over time of an exogenous shock in either of the dependent vari-\nables, taking into account the interrelationships reflected by the estimated system of equations. In\nTable 3 we present the impulse response function for a unit shock to entrepreneurial activity (im-\npact on unemployment) and for a unit shock to unemployment (impact on entrepreneurial activ-\nity) for Model IIa. Focusing on equation (6) we see that the direct effect is greatest for the second\n13\nperiod of four years. For instance, a one percent point increase in the self-employment rate brings\ndown the unemployment by 1.12 percent point eight years later. The time pattern of the effect of\nself-employment on unemployment is illustrated in Figure 1, which pictures the impulse response\nfunction for Model IIa. The cumulative effect converges to -1.29 (note that Figure 1 relates to the\ndirect effect).\nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE\nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nTable 3 shows that the initial impact of more entrepreneurial activity on unemployment is\npositive. Perhaps, initially, the increased competition by new entrants leads to higher labour pro-\nductivity at the industry level, while industry output remains constant (Fritsch and Mueller,\n2004). This implies a negative effect on employment. After some time, the new entrants may\ngrow and actually contribute to economic growth.14 One must be careful with this type of conclu-\nsions as t-values for the one lag self-employment variables are low, as shown in Table 2.\nThe finding that countries with a greater increase in entrepreneurial activity also experience\nsystematically higher employment growth rates may be linked to a Schumpeterian process of new\nand small firms generating new products and production processes with the consequence that\nolder products and production processes are replaced. This Schumpeterian process is driven by a\nsequence of independent and isolated opportunities (Sutton, 1997, p. 48). In the Kirznerian per-\nspective (Kirzner, 1973), entrepreneurship is the response to these previously undiscovered profit\nopportunities.15 This may lead to increased consumer satisfaction at a lower cost, hence to eco-\nnomic growth and lower unemployment. Profit opportunities might not only spur entrepreneurial\nactivity but may also be generated by entrepreneurs starting new firms. This idea dates to Schum-\npeter (1934) and Hayek (1945): modern decentralized economies allow individuals to act on their\nentrepreneurial views and allow them to be rewarded.\nTable 3 shows that changes in unemployment have a positive impact on subsequent self-\nemployment. This is in line with earlier findings as documented in the introduction. This is the\n\u201crefugee\u201d effect of unemployment: it stimulates start-up and self-employment rates. Our results\nindicate that the impact of a one percent point increase in unemployment leads to a 0.16 percent\n14 In their study of new business formation and regional development over time Fritsch and Mueller (2004) find that the peak of\nthe positive impact of new businesses is reached about eight years after entry. This is similar to the time lag in our study.\nFritsch and Mueller, however, apply the Almon lag model and discriminate between indirect effects of new business forma-\ntion (crowding out of competitors, improvement of supply conditions and improved competitiveness) and a direct effect (the\njobs created in the new businesses). See also Carree and Thurik (2007) and van Stel and Suddle (2007).\n15 See Yu (1998) for an examination of the role of adaptive entrepreneurship and its role in the dynamics of Hong Kong\u2019s econo-\nmy.\n14\npoint increase in self-employment after eight years. Note that the \u201crefugee\u201d effect is considerably\nsmaller than the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect, i.e. the magnitude of the impacts in the right part of Ta-\nble 3 is much smaller compared to the effects reported in the left part of the table.\nTesting for Coefficient Heterogeneity\nThe set-up of our model assumes that the relationships are identical across the countries in our\nestimation sample. In this subsection we test for coefficient heterogeneity across countries for the\nintercept terms and the coefficients reflecting the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201crefugee\u201d effects, i.e. co-\nefficients \uf061 , \uf062 , \uf06b and \uf06c in equations (6) and (7). For the intercept terms \uf061 and \uf06b we apply\nlikelihood ratio (LR) tests to investigate whether inclusion of country dummies improves the\nmodel fit. Regarding coefficients \uf062 and \uf06c we multiply the corresponding self-employment and\nunemployment variables with per capita income and include these cross-terms as additional vari-\nables in the model.16 This way we test whether the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201crefugee\u201d effects vary\nwith the development level of a country. For example, van Stel, Carree and Thurik (2005) find\nthat the effect of entrepreneurial activity (TEA) on economic growth is higher for highly devel-\noped countries than for less developed countries. We may find a similar dependence on per capita\nincome in the current analysis. All tests are conducted relative to Model IIa, the statistically pre-\nferred model in Table 2.\nRegarding equation (6) where the change in unemployment is to be explained, we find no\nevidence for country-specificity of the intercept term \uf061 . The LR test statistic equals 23.1 while\nthe critical value at the 5% significance level equals 33.9. Interestingly, when adding the multi-\nplicative variable 8128 )( \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf0b4\uf02d ttt YCAPEE to model specification IIa, this cross-term is significant\nat the 5% level and an LR test supports inclusion of this variable.17 The coefficients imply that\nthe effect of the variable 128 \uf02d\uf02d \uf02d tt EE can be written as 8173.0468.1 \uf02d\uf02d tYCAP . Hence, the (nega-\ntive) impact of entrepreneurial activity on unemployment increases with per capita income. To\ngive an impression of the variation across countries, per capita income values for 1994 imply an\neffect of 0.18 for Greece and an effect of -2.50 for the United States. In conformity with van Stel,\nCarree and Thurik (2005) we see that the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect is greater for higher developed\ncountries.\n16 We use real per capita income levels in thousands of US dollars, harmonized across countries using purchasing power parities.\n17 We also estimated specifications including the multiplicative term corresponding to one lag (i.e. 484 )( \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf0b4\uf02d ttt YCAPEE ),\nboth added separately and simultaneously with the two lag cross-term. In addition, we estimated specifications including the\nper capita income variable. All these alternative specifications turned out to be statistically inferior to the one solely adding\nthe two lag cross-term to Model IIa.\n15\nRegarding equation (7) where the change in self-employment is to be explained, we find\nevidence that coefficient \uf06b varies by country. Inclusion of country dummies significantly im-\nproves the model fit. The LR test statistic equals 40.9 for a critical value of 33.9. Closer inspec-\ntion of the dummy coefficients reveals that France and Japan have the two highest coefficients, in\nthe absolute sense. The two countries are exceptional: the self-employment rate in these countries\nhas been continuously declining since the 1970s. When we include country dummies for France\nand Japan only, 2R equals 0.489 (compared with 0.385 in Table 2). Coefficients and t-values of\nthe unemployment variables are similar to Model IIa in Table 2 though: 0.067 (t-value 2.3) for\nthe one lag variable and 0.083 for the two lag variable (t-value 2.7). Hence the magnitude of the\n\u201crefugee\u201d effect is robust: the inclusion of country dummies makes no difference. Finally, no evi-\ndence is found for heterogeneity of the \uf06c coefficients in that they depend upon per capita income\nlevels.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe small business sector, and hence self-employment, has become increasingly important to\nmodern OECD economies as they attempt to generate economic growth and employment. New\nand small firms have emerged as a major vehicle for entrepreneurship to thrive (Audretsch and\nThurik, 2001). The present paper shows the important role that changes in self-employment can\nplay in reducing unemployment.\nAs public policy turned to entrepreneurship to generate employment and economic growth,\npolicy makers have turned to the academic literature seeking guidance. The advice they have\nfound is ambiguous at best, conflicting and contradicting at worst. While some studies find a\npositive link between unemployment and start-up or self-employment rates, as a result of what\nwe refer to in this paper as the \u201crefugee\u201d effect, other studies find evidence supporting a negative\nlink between unemployment and start-up or self-employment rates, as a result of what we call the\n\u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect. These two findings suggest radically different policy approaches. On the\none hand, the literature focusing on the decision to become an entrepreneur suggests that public\npolicy can reduce unemployment by providing instruments to promote entrepreneurship but does\nnot necessarily stimulate economic growth. This literature implies policies encouraging the un-\nemployed to become entrepreneurs. On the other hand, literature suggesting that by generating\neconomic growth, entrepreneurship will mitigate unemployment results in policy focusing on in-\nstruments inducing high-growth entrepreneurship. The disparate recommendations resulting from\n16\nthese literatures have resulted in ambiguous implications for public policy concerning entrepre-\nneurship.\nEven further ambiguities emerging from the literature concerning the link between self-\nemployment and unemployment involve the business cycle. Studies reveal a positive impact of\neconomic downturns, which encourages unemployed workers to become self-employed, but also\na positive impact of economic upturns, where growth opportunities induce an increase in entre-\npreneurial activity. The unemployed do not enjoy the benefits of a paid job and will tend to\nsearch for one, \u201cpushing\u201d people into self-employment. However, low unemployment is likely to\ncoincide with a lively market demand for products and services \u201cpulling\u201d the (un)-employed to-\nwards self-employment (Parker, 2004). Thus, there is both a \u201crecession-push\u201d and a \u201cprosperity-\npull\u201d aspect of the relation between unemployment and self-employment.\nOverall, the relationships between self-employment and unemployment are fraught with\ncomplexity resulting in confusion and ambiguity for both scholars and policy makers. This paper\nattempts to unravel these complex relationships. Explicitly modelling self-employment and un-\nemployment within the context of a simultaneous relationship, this paper uses a rich data set of\nOECD countries for a recent period to identify that the relationship between unemployment and\nself-employment is, in fact, both negative and positive. Changes in unemployment clearly have a\npositive impact on subsequent changes in self-employment rates. At the same time, changes in\nself-employment rates have a negative impact on subsequent unemployment rates. The latter is\neven stronger than the former. Because these are dynamic inter-temporal relationships, previous\nstudies estimating contemporaneous relationships have confounded what are, in fact, two rela-\ntionships each working in opposite directions and with different time lags. Our model shows that\nit is crucial to allow for different and variable time lags. It shows that both the effect of self-\nemployment on unemployment and that of unemployment on self-employment are rather long.\nThis is one of the reasons why policy makers \u2013 favouring quick responses and results \u2013 have been\nslow to discover the prominent role of entrepreneurship in the economy.\nAn additional finding of our analyses is that the impact of entrepreneurial activity on\nmacro-economic performance increases with per capita income. This is also found in van Stel,\nCarree and Thurik (2005) where an entirely different data set is used. Hence, the many policy ini-\ntiatives of the highly developed European countries to stimulate entrepreneurship seem justified.\nOne limitation of our research, which is inherent to working with country data, is that we\ncannot directly trace the factors that influence the probability of moving from unemployment to\nself-employment at the micro level. For instance, heterogeneity across individuals (concerning\n17\neducation, former experience, etc.) is of great importance when we want to explain the success\nrate of exiting unemployment. Likewise, concerning the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect, we know that\nheterogeneity across individuals plays a role as well. For instance, research at the micro level\nshows that education levels of entrepreneurs positively influence the probability of achieving firm\ngrowth (Congregado, Golpe and Mill\u00e1n, 2005). In our study this heterogeneity is aggregated\naway into self-employment and unemployment statistics at the country level. This shortcoming\ncan only in a limited way be addressed by incorporating possible additional variables determining\nself-employment and unemployment rates, thereby extending the VAR-model to a VARX-model.\nNotwithstanding the above limitation, the results of this study are of significant policy im-\nportance because policy often aims at achieving desirable effects at the economy-wide level. For\nthis purpose it is important to understand the relations at the macro-economic level, as studied in\nthe present paper. For instance, Germany, a country with high unemployment, recently adopted\npolicies designed to encourage unemployed individuals to exit unemployment by self-\nemployment (Audretsch, Grilo and Thurik, 2007). However, as the current paper shows that the\n\u201crefugee\u201d effect is relatively small, one might wonder if such policies are worthwhile. Based on\nthe larger \u201centrepreneurial\u201d effect we suggest that it might be more effective to encourage entre-\npreneurship in general as higher levels of entrepreneurial activity significantly lower subsequent\nunemployment levels. In other words, unemployed individuals may have a bigger chance to es-\ncape unemployment by way of being hired by (new) entrepreneurs than by way of trying to start\nand maintain a new firm. This, in turn, may be related to the \u2013 on average \u2013 relatively low human\ncapital levels of unemployed individuals making them less competent to run a firm (van Stel and\nStorey, 2004). Thus, the results of this paper unequivocally suggest that public policy to generate\njobs and reduce unemployment would be best served by focusing more on innovative and high-\ngrowth entrepreneurship than on inducing the unemployed into entering into self-employment.\n18\nREFERENCES\nAcs, Zoltan J., and David B.
