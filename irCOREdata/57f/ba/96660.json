The development and use of hypermedia inside and outside the classroom has made it\npossible to change both the students' and the lecturer's attitude towards the material being learnt.\nHowever, the courseware does not seem to equip students sufficiently for essay writing, and this\nproblem needs further investigation.\nIntroduction\nThe tradition of incorporating CALL into the language-learning curriculum goes back to\nthe early 1980s at Coventry University, and since then has evolved in keeping with\nchanges in the technology available (Corness 1984; Benwell 1986; Orsini-Jones 1987;\nCorness et al 1992; Orsini-Jones 1993).\nCoventry University is at present pioneering the integration of hypermedia into the\ncurriculum for the teaching of Italian language and society. The syllabus for a complete\nmodule of the BA Modern Languages and BA European Studies Degrees, which will\ncount as l\/8th of the students' programme for year 2, has been designed upon in-house\nproduced hypermedia courseware.\nAlthough the module has not yet run in its present version, the prototype of the\nHypermedia Italian Team's (HIT) project La neve nel bicchiere has been used, in the\n28 v\nALT-) Volume 4 Number 2\nacademic years 1993\/4,1994\/5 and 1995\/6, with students taking Italian as an option in the\nfinal year of their BA Honours Degree in Modern Languages.\nThe testing of the prototype and its integration into the language-learning process have\nbeen very successful and have helped in creating a new cognitive model: the FREE -\nFluid Role-Exchange Environment. The original concept of the FREE arose from the\nobservation that the very nature of hypermedia technology allowed students not only to\nconsume the finished product, but also to play an active role in its creation and in its\nregular revision and re-elaboration. Thus the experience of one cohort of students is fed\nback into the program for the benefit of the succeeding cohort (See Acknowledgements).\nThey cannot do this directly, but indirectly via the lecturer and the technical designer.\nThis was an essential feature of the development stage of the project but, due to the\nflexible nature of the technology, there is no reason why this process should not continue\nindefinitely in the future.\nThe Project La neve nel bicchiere: why, what, where, when and how\nOrigins of the project\nThe HIT project was born out of two main needs. The first was of a pedagogical nature:\nthe need to find suitable materials for students taking Italian as a subsidiary language in\nthe last year of their BA in Modern Languages. The course in Languages at Coventry is\n(or, at least, was at the time) area studies- rather than literature-based, but it was decided\nnevertheless to base much of the year's work on the study of a novel. There were several\nreasons for this decision: the wish to expose students to a different style of language from\nthat encountered hitherto in newspaper and magazine articles; the coherence and\ncontinuity provided by a lengthy text; and the fact that works of fiction can sometimes\nprovide a more lively, but nonetheless accurate, picture of social conditions than can the\nstudy of factual material.\nIt was, of course, necessary to choose the novel carefully. It needed to be by a\ncontemporary author, and to deal with the lives of ordinary people in a realistic way. It\nalso needed to be of the right length to be covered in the 25 teaching weeks available. The\nnovel would be used for the purpose of teaching the language as well as the history and\nsociety of Italy. La neve nel bicchiere by Nerino Rossi (Rossi, 1977) was eventually chosen\nbecause it fitted perfectly within the lecturer's requirements. The book, written in the first\nperson and clearly autobiographical in origin, describes the historical and social\nconditions of an Italian family over a period of 70 years (1880-1950). Furthermore there\nis a film based upon it, and it is easy to access materials about Emilia-Romagna, the\nItalian region in which the book is set.\nThe book and film were used for two years. However, the students' performance in their\nseminar presentations of the chapters in the book was poor. Students were finding using a\nbook too difficult, and this reflected negatively on their ability to communicate effectively\nin Italian. It was therefore necessary to find a way of making the book more user-friendly,\nas it was felt it was vital to keep it as the textbook, but the way it was being used was\nobviously not achieving the objectives set in the syllabus.\nSecondly, there was a need of a more practical nature: the teaching hours for the Italian\n\u2014\nMarina Orsini-Jones and David Jones Hypermedia for language learning: the FREE model at Coventry University\noption were reduced from three to two per week after the introduction of modularization\n(1992). It was obvious that it would be impossible to cover the book in the existing format\nof lecture\/seminar presentation\/language work, particularly in view of the difficulties\nstudents were experiencing with the material. It was felt that developing a hypermedia\npackage to be used both inside and outside the classroom would be the ideal way of\ncreating a more stimulating means of access to the book for the students.\nCreating the package\nThe way in which the HIT proceeded in building the package on screen was the following:\nin the first place, each screen was designed on paper by the lecturer creating the package,\nthen submitted to the rest of the team for comments. Once the screen was in its electronic\nversion, feedback was asked of students too. Their feedback was also used by the lecturer\nand the technical designer to further modify the package. All the texts but one (the\nchronology, see below) were first typed in Word for Windows, then transferred into\nToolBook. The whole of the text was transferred to the computer (manually, by two\nresearch assistants) after the issue of copyright was cleared with the publisher.\nIn constructing the courseware, the HIT tried to avoid making the mistakes outlined by\nKhan (1995), i.e. producing courseware which is visually attractive but educationally\nweak: 'Too many people put a linear book online, give it some bookmarks, and call it a\nhypertext; worse yet, they add a few scanned-in photographs and a soundtrack and call it\nmultimedia' (p.99). Such 'mistakes' occur when courseware designers follow McLuhan's\ndicta ( McLuhan and Fiore, 1967) too strictly, and become infatuated with the medium\nrather than the message. In the course of the development of La neve, the HIT became\nincreasingly aware of the negative attitudes to multimedia which have developed among\nsome colleagues involved in CALL, probably due to exposure to educationally weak\nproducts. Bad multimedia products reinforce the old 'not invented here' syndrome, and\nencourage the recent backlash against information technology which is becoming\nincreasingly fashionable - see, for example, the various articles in the Multimedia insert in\nThe Higher (such as the centre-page on 12th March 1995, pp. vi-viii).\nUsing the courseware\nThe starting point of the students' activities is the text of the book (which they also have\nin hard copy). After the credits screens comes a summary page: by passing the pointer on\nthe various buttons for the different chapters, a brief summary of each chapter appears on\nthe left-hand side of the screen (Figure 1). This was done in order to allow students to\nskim and scan for major topics in the book. By clicking on the buttons called Capitolo 1,\nCapitolo 2 (Chapter 1, Chapter 2) etc., students access the text of each chapter (Figure 2).\nOn this screen are two sets of buttons. On the right-hand side are the 'books' buttons\nwhich lead to information about:\n\u2022 Italian history - Cronologia (Figures 3 and 4);\n\u2022 a glossary activated via hotwords in the main text - Vocabolario;\n\u2022 a description for each character mentioned in the book, both fictional and historical -\nPersonaggi non storicilPersonaggi Storici;\n30\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\n\u2022 geography of the region connected to the places mentioned in the book - Luoghi\n(Figures 5 and 6);\n\u2022 the revision exercise for each chapter, in a multiple-choice format - Revisione Capitolo.\nSome pictures (historical characters, places, etc.) and some extracts from the film (chosen\nby the students in 1995\/6) have been incorporated into the courseware too.\nThe words in the glossary have mostly been chosen by students. Feedback from students\nalso affected the way the words in the glossary were explained: originally it was thought\nthe glossary should be monolingual, but this idea encountered strong resistance from all\ncohorts of student users. The compromise solution is that there is a translation of each\nword in the glossary, but any further explanations are in Italian.\nLa neve nel bicchi\nFigure I: Summary page with\nbuttons for each chapter in the\nbook.

Students who want to use the prototype in their self-study time can easily do so\nas it is available on the network in three different open-access laboratories.\nTo sum up, to date the project has helped students of Italian to develop:\n\u2022 their ability to make cross-references between the different components of their\nsyllabus for Italian (i.e. history\/language\/present-day society);\n\u2022 their linguistic\/communicative skills;\n\u2022 their information technology skills.\nThe feedback and the outcomes\nThe HIT has been pleased with the feedback obtained both from the students using the\nprototype and from the teachers\/lecturers who have seen it at CALL conferences and\/or\nworkshops. The general comment has been that they find it extremely easy to understand\nhow to navigate the hypermedia environment in La neve.\nHowever, students varied in their initial reactions to hypermedia. In the academic year\n1994\/5, at the beginning of the first term, some were very reluctant to use the courseware,\nmainly because they did not have any IT skills. For some, this issue was overcome after\nthe four hours IT training provided as part of the Italian course; for others, extra hours of\nIT instruction were needed (4-6) and were provided as guided-study time hours.\nBy the end of the second term, even the most reluctant students had been converted to\nhypermedia - mainly because their oral performance in Italian had improved\n34\nAn-} Volume 4 Number 2\ndramatically. This change was noticed by the lecturer in charge of the course, who found\nthat students who had used hypermedia presented their material in a more effective way\nthan those who had used the book before the introduction of the courseware.\nThe biggest achievements brought about by the use of hypermedia in the academic year\n1994\/5 - the year in which the feedback was monitored in a more systematic way - were\nas follows.\n\u2022 Even the most computer-illiterate students had acquired word-processing skills: all\nstudents word-processed both the hand-outs for their seminar presentation and their\nassessed essays.\n\u2022 Using the courseware La neve nel bicchiere had had an impact on the learning and\npresentation techniques of the learners. The structure of the courseware, which is\ntopic-driven, was clearly reflected in the re-elaboration of the material carried out by\nthe students, who gave highly structured and well-presented 'lectures' and made\nextensive use of various teaching aids (such as OHP transparencies, extracts from the\nfilm, pictures, charts, etc.). Students, moreover, prepared and distributed to their\ncolleagues good-quality hand-outs used for their presentations.\n\u2022 Students enjoyed the courseware and were keen to contribute to its construction.\nTheoretical considerations\nThe main aim of the HIT project was the creation of a learning environment which was\nfilled with content consistent with the medium carrying it. The HIT also wanted to\ninvolve students further in their 'learning contract', to enable them to participate in the\nconstruction of hypermedia on as equal terms as possible with their lecturers. The\nobjective was a more democratic setting where roles could be easily exchanged.\nThe starting point was the adoption of the constnictivist theory of learning (Barker and\nProud, 1987; Merrill, 1991; Cunningham et al, 1993; Barker, 1993), according to which\nindividual students and groups of learners should be actively involved in constructing\nknowledge, rather than being mere consumers of other people's. Because of its inherent\nflexibility, hypermedia lends itself to this approach to learning.\nIt was of course necessary to prepare the ground for the introduction of truly integrated\nCALL materials into the classroom. Both lecturers and learners needed briefing about\ntheir new functions. The cognitive model represented in the FREE (Table 1) stemmed\nboth from the experience of integrating hypermedia courseware and from that of keeping\nrecords of the students' and lecturers' feedback about the courseware.\nThe FREE functions as a fluid and interactive 'pool' where the three main actors, or\nactants, i.e. the learner, the lecturer and the computer, exchange roles. The choice of the\nword actants instead of actors is deliberate. Actants, which originated in French\nlinguistics, is widely used in Italian linguistics - attanti. In etymological terms it is a noun\nwhich derives from a participle, an indefinite mood which better embodies the dynamism\nof the interchangeable roles the actants can assume in a hypermedia environment. Actors\nwould convey the idea of a more passive role. The hypermedia environment - which is\nthree-dimensional by nature - enables the three actants to amplify and multiply their\n35\nMarina Orsini-Jones and David Jones Hypermedia for language learning: the FREE model at Coventry University\nvarious roles in a fluid web of cognitive relationships (represented by the arrows in Figure\n7).\nUsing hypermedia encouraged an on-going, open-ended redefinition of the 'imaginary\nborders' around the three above-mentioned actants. This is meant to be in keeping with\nthe philosophy underlying the approach to the integration of IT expounded by the more\nPiaget-oriented CAL theorists (see for example Papert, 1980; Varisco and Mason, 1989;\nPaterson and Rosbottom, 1995). In the FREE model, the word tool is intended as\nmeaning a flexible 'inanimate object'. It is applied only to the computer, which is thus\nsimilar to the computer in the role of 'pedagogue' as described by Higgins (1983). In this\nrole it serves both learners and lecturers. But the computer is not only a tool, as it can be\na tutee too (students constructing hypermedia\/lecturer constructing hypermedia) and\/or a\ntutor (self-access, open-study). Similarly, the lecturer can be both tutor and tutee (sitting\nback and learning from the learners) and the same applies to the learners. Within the\nFREE, students were - and are - involved at the following levels:\n\u2022 testing, both inside and outside the language classroom, of the various versions of the\nprototype;\n\u2022 evaluation, via questionnaires in Italian and English and weekly reports in both Italian\nand English about the courseware;\n\u2022 construction: compilation of lists of hot-words to be included in the glossary of the\nelectronic version of the book, writing of the Help file for the courseware (in English), etc.\nFREE: ELWDEOLE-IXCHANGE ENVIRONMENT\nActanti\nLearner\nActant2\nLecturer\nComputer\nActant3\nFigure 7: Graphic representation of the\nFREE model.\n36\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nThe students' feedback, filtered by the lecturer and the technical designer (the\nExperimental Officer within the School - Vic Tandy), feeds into the courseware which is\nthen tested again by the students. Further feedback is collected and incorporated as much\nas possible into the package and so on and so forth in a kind of circular paradigm of\nknowledge. In this way we can truly talk about tailoring the prototype according to\nstudents' needs. We must stress though that construction here refers to construction of\ncontents, rather than programming.\nThe process of student involvement was enhanced by the support of funding from both\nthe Enterprise in Higher Education Initiative and the Learning Development Systems\nFunds within Coventry University. Funds were obtained, for example, to pay some\nstudents as research assistants so that they could keep a weekly diary - some in Italian\nand some in English - of their use of the HIT project and of their reactions to it. Other\nstudents received funding to select the hot-words, and subsequently to check the accuracy\nof the English for each definition in the glossary. More recently, the allocation of some\nEuropean funding (Leonardo Transnational Pilot Project for the Dissemination of\nInnovation in Language Teaching) has made it possible to pay some students to create the\nHelp file for La neve. Needless to say, it boosts students' confidence to know that:\na. their feedback is valued by the designers of the product;\nb. their feedback is incorporated, where possible, into the product; and\nc. they can earn some money by participating in the creation of the project. The\nvocational aspect of receiving funding for their contribution motivates undergraduates\nfurther, particularly in the present climate of diminishing grants.\nConclusion\nThe experience of integrating the courseware via students' involvement has been positive.\nThe development and use of hypermedia both inside and outside the classroom has made\nit possible to change both the students' and the lecturer's attitude towards the material\nbeing learnt. The aim of boosting students' communicative competence was achieved: it\nwould appear that the integration of hypermedia is ideal for developing the skill of\nspeaking in the foreign language, as well as that of taking notes in order to prepare for\nseminar presentations.\nIt would also appear that the courseware La neve nel bicchiere has been effective in\ncreating a new CALL model - the FREE - within which students, lecturers and\ncomputers can interact in a fluid and flexible way.\nHowever, the courseware and\/or the module do not seem to equip students sufficiently for\nessay-writing. This skill needs to be further developed in order to avoid repetition, plagiarism\nand lack of originality. In 1993\/4 there was the embarrassing recurrence of the same piece of\ntext, reproduced word for word from the courseware in the essays in the written\nexamination. In 1994\/5 students were therefore warned repeatedly against plagiarism. This\ntime the essays did not reproduce large chunks of texts from the courseware, but were mainly\ndescriptive and not at all satisfactory. This compared unfavourably with the analytical\nquality of the seminar presentation and of the rest of their work during the year.\n37\nMarino Orsini-Jones and David Jones Hypermedia for language learning: the FREE model at Coventry University\nThe latter issue will be investigated in a systematic way - jointly with the English\nLanguage Unit at Coventry University - in academic years 1995\/6 and 1996\/7, in order to\ncollect sufficient evidence as to why the students' written performance is not as good as\ntheir oral one. The following are the questions which will be addressed.\n1. Do students find it difficult to write essays in an analytical way both in English and in\nItalian? If so, why?\n2. Did the fact that they had to hand-write the final exam paper up to academic year\n1994\/5 affect their ability to write a good essay? Students had in fact worked with word\nprocessors and the hypermedia package all year, but were then required to do their\nwritten examination in a traditional setting. As indicated by Martha Pennington, in the\ntalk she gave at the CALL and the Learning Environment conference in September 1995:\n'Writing the natural way: on computer', this could account for the substandard\nperformance the students gave. In 1995\/6 the first trial of an open electronic-book\nexamination will be carried out during the May\/June exam period, and the results will be\ncompared with previous, hand-written, exam paper answers.\n3. Does the lecturer in charge of the module put too much stress on oral presentation\nskills and not enough on writing skills?\nThese questions need to be addressed, and answers found, with hard evidence at hand (i.e.\nthe students' exam-paper essays) in order to prevent a re-occurrence of the problem.\nThe above issues do not diminish the value of the introduction of hypermedia, on the\ncontrary, they are proof to the fact that its introduction was invaluable for the lecturers\ninvolved both in terms of self-assessment and of staff development.\nFinally, using the courseware has also resulted in higher student motivation, which was\nshown by the response to the module based upon the courseware - 301 LAI Italian\nLanguage and Society - given by the students in 1994\/5 in the evaluation questionnaires\nfilled in at the end of the academic year. The module scored 5\/5 overall (on a 1-5 scoring\nsystem), i.e. total student satisfaction.\nAcknowledgements\nIt was thanks to various brainstorming sessions with colleagues and friends - in particular\nKathy Courtney (TLTP: project ASTCOVEA, Coventry University) and Frank Knowles\n(Linguistics, University of Aston) - that it was possible to arrive at the FREE definition\nof our model. We would also like to thank all the students of Italian who used the\ncourseware and actively contributed to its construction and development in academic\nyears 1992\/3, 1993\/4, 1994\/5 and 1995\/6.\nReferences\nBarker, P.G. and Proud, A.
