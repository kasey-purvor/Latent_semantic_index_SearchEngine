Introduction and background\nVaccination does not necessarily imply life-long\nimmunity for a vaccinated person. In some cases,\nvaccination is ineffective and fails to provide immunity\nat all (the so-called \u2018\u2018primary failure\u2019\u2019); sometimes\nimmunity acquired through vaccination wanes and does\nnot provide life-long protection (\u2018\u2018secondary failure\u2019\u2019).\nFor example, the New Zealand statistical data show that\nin the case of measles, when vaccination is known to\nbe reliable, about one-third of those infected, whose\nvaccination history is known, received one dose, and\nabout 2% received two doses of the vaccine (NZ ESR,\n1997). This is especially relevant to pertussis. The\nvaccine against pertussis is known to be unreliable: the\nimmunity acquired due to vaccination wanes over time\n(Cullen and Walker, 1997).\nThis leads to the question of how effective is\nthe vaccination in reality. To quantitatively describe\nefficiency of vaccination we introduce the term effective\nvaccination rate. By this term we mean the portion of the\npopulation which at a given moment has immunity\nacquired through the vaccination. If N is the total\npopulation, n\u00f0a\u00de the population of age a and P\u00f0a\u00de the\nportion of population of age a immune through the\nvaccination, then the effective vaccination rate, #p; is\n#p \u00bc\nRN\n0 P\u00f0a\u00den\u00f0a\u00de da\nN\n:\nThe effective vaccination rate reflects the whole popula-\ntion and takes into account both primary and secondary\nvaccination failure without distinguishing between\nthem. Humans are assumed to be born susceptible; at\nsome age a fraction of them is vaccinated (but because\nof the primary vaccination failure even the maximum\nvaccination level is lower than the rate of vaccination).\nAfter some time immunity starts to wane, and the\nfraction of people immune due to vaccination declines.\nFig. 1 schematically represents vaccination and the\nimmunity fadeout by age.\nFor obvious reasons, the effective vaccination rate\ncannot be measured directly since it implies continual\ntesting of a significant portion of the population. The\ncost of such mass tests can be considerably higher than\nthat of the vaccination campaign itself, and it definitely\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n*Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: korobein@maths.ox.ac.uk (A.

In this work, we attempt to\nevaluate the effective vaccination rate for pertussis in\nNew Zealand using a simple and reliable approach\nbased on published statistical data.\nPertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious\ndisease of the respiratory tract, spread by droplets.\nInfection is particularly severe in young infants,\nespecially for those under 1-year old, a group which is\nmost likely to be hospitalized. Pertussis mortality rates\nare higher in the first year of life than at any other age;\nbeyond 3 years of age mortality rates are relatively low.\nIn comparison with other common infectious\nillnesses, such as mumps and measles, descriptions of\npertussis appeared relatively recently, in the 16th\ncentury. The disease was known under different names:\nItalians spoke of the \u2018\u2018dog bark\u2019\u2019, in England it was\nknown as the \u2018\u2018chin cough\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018kin cough\u2019\u2019, later to be\ncalled whooping cough, the Chinese called it the \u2018\u2018100\nday cough\u2019\u2019 because of the protracted course of the\ndisease. Thomas Sydenham first used the term infantum\npertussis in 1670, \u2018\u2018pertussis\u2019\u2019 meaning a violent cough of\nany kind. Bordet and Gengou identified the causative\norganism in 1906 (hence the name Bordetella pertussis),\nand the first crude vaccine was developed soon after\nfrom killed bacteria.\nIn New Zealand, monovalent pertussis vaccine was\nintroduced by the Department of Health in 1945, and\nfrom 1953 it was also available in combination with\ndiphtheria vaccine. Routine childhood immunization\nstarted in 1960. Three doses were given at 3, 4 and 5\nmonths of age, respectively. In 1971, the policy was\naltered to two doses of vaccine given at 3 and 5 months\nof age. Following this schedule change there was a\nprogressive increase in hospitalizations in 1974, 1978\nand 1982, and consequently a third dose given at 6\nweeks of age was added in 1984 to provide earlier\nprotection. A fourth dose of pertussis vaccine was added\nin 1996 given at 15 months of age with the goals of\nincreasing protection in young children and reducing\nrisk of transmission to younger siblings. A further\nbooster dose given at 4 years of age was introduced\nin February 2002 to protect children during the early\nschool years and to decrease transmission of the\ninfection to younger children.\nNevertheless, the current situation with pertussis in\nNew Zealand can hardly be considered as satisfactory.\nRecurrent epidemics occur every 4\u20135 years, with high\nnumbers of infants hospitalized. The most recent\nepidemics of pertussis occurred in 1999\u20132001. Since\nthe start of the epidemic in June 1999 and by the end of\nMarch 2001, a total of 5781 cases (of which 2737 cases\nwere laboratory confirmed) have been notified (NZ\nMinistry of Health, 2001). There have been 412\nhospitalizations, and one death was reported (NZ\nMinistry of Health, 2001). Also there have been 550\nhospitalizations during the epidemics in 1996 (NZ\nHealth Information Service, 2000).\n2. Model\nThere is no specific limitation on the type of model for\nthis work; in fact any reasonably accurate model can be\nused. We will use a discrete-time compartmental model.\nThe main advantage of the discrete-time models\ncompared with continuous-time models is their natural\ntime-scaling. The natural time-scale for epidemiological\nprocesses is a parasite generation, and we shall use this\nas the time interval. By the term \u2018\u2018parasite generation\u2019\u2019\nwe mean the average time interval which commences\nwhen a susceptible host is exposed to an infective dose,\nincludes the period during which the host passes\ninfection and ends when the host is fully recovered,\nisolated or dead.\nThe choice of a parasite generation as the time\ninterval for a discrete-time model leads to important\nconsequences. Firstly, with a parasite generation as the\ntime interval we naturally approximate the recovery\nprocess by a step function (Fig. 2, curve A, B), whereas\nfor continuous-time models, unless integro-differential\nequations or equations with a time delay are used, one\nhas to postulate that motion from exposed to the\ninfectious class and then to the recovery class occurs at\nconstant rates (Fig. 2, curve C). This last assumption,\nwhile mathematically convenient, is rarely realistic and\ncan lead to results contradicting observations (Keeling\nand Grenfell, 1997). Secondly, since in the case of a\ndiscrete-time model we consider disease transmission\nnot as a continuous process but in terms of secondary\ncases produced by an infective for a parasite generation,\nwe have no need for an exposed class, or for any class\nfor the hosts in the incubation or in the latent state. The\nthird (but not the least important) advantage provided\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nVaccination level\n0\n1.0\nAge \nFr\nac\ntio\nn \nof\n im\nm\nun\ne\nv\nia\n v\nac\nci\nna\ntio\nn\nFig. 1.

Korobeinikov et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 224 (2003) 269\u2013275270\nby a discrete-time model with a parasite generation as\nthe time interval, is that it allows natural interpretation\nof all model parameters and data obtained. The last\nfeature is of definite importance for this work, and\ndetermined our choice of modelling approach.\nAn apparent drawback of the discrete-time models is\nthat parasite generations can overlap. Nevertheless, this\ndoes not affect the inter-epidemic period.\nWe consider a SIR compartment model, that is we\nassume that a population of size N is partitioned into\nsusceptibles S; infected I ; and immune (or removed) R\ncompartments, i.e. N \u00bc S \u00fe I \u00fe R: We will denote the\nnumber of individuals in a compartment in a generation\nby a capital letter with a subindex, e.g. In; Sn\u00fe1; etc. All\nnewborns come into the susceptible compartment. After\ninfection, an individual moves from the susceptible class\ninto the infected class and then into the immune\ncompartment as a result of recovery, death or isolation.\nWe assume here that recovery implies life-long immu-\nnity, and hence there is no return from the immune\ncompartment into the susceptible compartment.\nThe population size N is assumed constant, and we\nneglect the susceptibles\u2019 natural mortality. The latter\nassumption is safe, since for pertussis, as well as for the\nmajority of childhood diseases, the class of susceptibles\nis composed of young people, and in developed\ncountries child mortality is low. Nevertheless, the\nsusceptibles\u2019 mortality must be taken into account if\na developing country, where child mortality is high, is\nunder consideration.\nBy the principle of mass action, we assume that\nduring a parasite generation an average infective comes\ninto infective contact with and might eventually infect\nR0 people (susceptible, infected, or recovered), where R0\nis the basic reproduction number. Some of these people\nmay be already infected or recovered and therefore\nclinically unaffected by the contact. Then, assuming that\nthe number of infectives in the \u00f0n \u00fe 1\u00de-th generation is\nequal to the number of infective contacts, we obtain the\nequations\nSn\u00fe1 \u00bc Sn \u0005 R0In\nSn\nN\n\u00fe bN; In\u00fe1 \u00bc R0In\nSn\nN\n: \u00f01\u00de\nThe constant population size assumption allows us to\nomit the third equation,\nRn\u00fe1 \u00bc Rn \u00fe In \u0005 bN;\nfor the immune population.\nThe principle of mass action is deficient in that for a\nfinite time interval a susceptible may be infected by more\nthan one infective and will be counted eventually as\nseveral infectives in the next generation (Cullen et al.,\n1999, 2003). Furthermore, system (1) is structurally\nunstable: the phase trajectories of the system near the\nfixed point form closed loops (Fig. 3), a structure which\nis fragile. In spite of the above-mentioned deficiencies,\nthe model allows us to determine the inter-epidemic\nperiod of an endemic disease, and thereby to estimate\nthe effective vaccination rate.\nSystem (1) has a unique fixed point, an endemic\nequilibrium state with coordinates\nSn \u00bc N=R0; In \u00bc bN:\nA substitution x \u00bc S=Sn and y \u00bc I=In leads to the\nsystem\nxn\u00fe1 \u00bc r\u00fe xn \u0005 rxnyn; yn\u00fe1 \u00bc xnyn: \u00f02\u00de\nThe system depends on the parameter r \u00bc R0b only.\n3.

Prior to mass\nvaccination the birth rate in New Zealand, United States\nand United Kingdom was about 25 births per thousand\nof the population per year (NZ Yearbook, 1998; US\nBureau of Census, 2002). These figures give b \u00bc 1\n480\nand\nr \u00bc 1\n30\n; and hence Eq. (4) gives the period Tn \u00bc 34:4\nparasite generations, or about a 3-year cycle. Pre-\nvaccination statistics from New Zealand (Cullen and\nWalker, 1997) and from England and Wales (Anderson\nand May, 1991; Anderson et al., 1984) also give the\n3-year (156 weeks) cycle for pertussis.\nComputations demonstrate that the inter-epidemic\nperiod increases with amplitude. Table 1 contains data\nfrom computations for r \u00bc 1\n30\n(the figure for pertussis in\nNew Zealand, United Kingdom and United States prior\nto mass vaccination) for different amplitudes. These\ndata indicate that, at least for amplitudes such that\nImax=Iminp4; Eq. (4) provides a good approximation of\nthe period Tn and that the period extends as the level of\ninfection grows.\nStatistical data demonstrate that in the pre-vaccina-\ntion period low-amplitude oscillations were typical for\npertussis. For example, in England and Wales the ratio\nImax=Imin was about 4\u0005 4:5 (Anderson and May, 1991,\np. 135). For such amplitudes, the computed period\npractically coincides with the value given by Eq.

Measles has R0E14\nand a parasite generation of 14 days on average\n(Anderson and May, 1991), i.e. there are 26 parasite\ngenerations per year.

Korobeinikov et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 224 (2003) 269\u2013275272\nWales with a 2-year period (Anderson and May, 1991,\np. 131); 2-year epidemic cycles were also typical for\nNew Zealand (Cullen and Walker, 1996) and USA (US\nDepartment of Human Services, 1994). African states,\nsuch as Cameroun, 1968\u20131975, and Nigeria, 1958\u20131961,\nprovide examples of 1-year measles epidemic cycles\n(Anderson and May, 1991, p. 129), which is in\nagreement with the birth rate of more than 50 births\nper thousand of the population recorded in these\ncountries (US Bureau of Census, 2002).\nHowever, measles perhaps is not the best example, as\nit exhibits a strong seasonality in incidence number\n(Anderson and May, 1991; Cullen et al., 2003; Dietz,\n1976; Keeling and Grenfell, 1997). This seasonality may\nbreak the natural epidemic cycle adjusting it to the\nseasons. Mumps has R0 \u00bc 12\u0005 13 and an average\nparasite generation of 21 days (Anderson and May,\n1991), or 17\u201318 parasite generations per year. For\nEngland and Wales, these figures give r \u00bc 0:018 and\nTn \u00bc 47 parasite generations, i.e. 3-year cycles which\ncoincides with the observations (Anderson et al., 1984).\nThree-year cycles were also observed in the pre-\nvaccination era in the USA (US Department of Human\nServices, 1994). That is we have another fit between the\nmodel prediction and the observations.\nPrior to the introduction of mass vaccination against\npoliomyelitis, a 3-year cycle was typical in the United\nStates (US Department of Human Services, 1994). For\npoliomyelitis in the United States R0 \u00bc 6 (Anderson\nand May, 1991, p. 70) and there are about 20 parasite\ngenerations in a year. These figures give rE0:0075 and\nTn \u00bc 72:6 which is higher than the expected 60 parasite\ngenerations, but it still fits data for England and Wales\n(3\u20135 years cycles).\nThese examples demonstrate a good correlation\nbetween the inter-epidemic periods predicted and the\navailable statistical data. This remarkably good fit is\nunlikely to be accidental, and it shows that the\ninter-epidemic period is an important and reliable\nindicator.\n4. Vaccination impact\nEffect of vaccination of a constant fraction, p; of the\nnewborns is equivalent to direct decline of influx of new\nsusceptibles into the system. Vaccinated individuals go\ndirectly into the immune compartment and, if their\nimmunity is preserved, do not participate in further\nevents. If a constant fraction p of the newborns is\nvaccinated then the system behaviour is equivalent to\nthat of system (1) with the apparent susceptibles influx\nrate #b \u00bc \u00f01\u0005 p\u00deb:\nConsequently, the mass vaccination results in\ndecline of the endemic equilibrium level of the infectives\nIn and, according to Eq. (4), in extension of the\ninter-epidemic period Tn: A lower value of the infectives\u2019\nequilibrium level In also suggests that the vaccination\nwill result in a lower level of the infective maxima (see\nFig. 3).\nThe available statistical data support both these\nconclusions. The most remarkable success of mass\nvaccination is the complete world-wide elimination of\nsmallpox. Although complete elimination has not been\nachieved for other endemic infections, decline of the\ninfection levels accomplished by prolonging of the inter-\nepidemic intervals has been observed for all diseases\nafter mass vaccination was introduced.\nFor example, in the United States after the introduc-\ntion of mass vaccination the 2-year cycle of measles\nturned into 4\u20136-year cycles and the infection level\ndropped by about ten times (US Department of Human\nServices, 1994). According to Eq. (4), three times longer\ninter-epidemic period (6 years instead of 2 years) implies\nnine times lower susceptibles influx, i.e. the rate of\nsuccessful vaccination is about 85\u201390% of the newborn.\nA similar result\u2014a 9-year inter-epidemic period and a\ndecline of the infection level of about ten times\u2014has\nbeen achieved in the US for rubella (US Department\nof Human Services, 1994). Mass vaccination against\nmumps also was accompanied by a decline of the\ninfectives\u2019 level of about ten times and prolongation of\nthe inter-epidemic period to 7 years (US Department of\nHuman Services, 1994) (perhaps even longer, since the\navailable time series are not long enough). Similar\nresults have been observed in other countries and for\nother diseases.\nWe can estimate the effective vaccination rate\ncomparing the real observed inter-epidemic period\nwith that provided by Eq. (4). According to Eq. (4),\nthe apparent rate of new susceptibles influx into the\nsusceptibles compartment, #b; connected with the inter-\nepidemic period Tn; is given by\n#b \u00bc\n4p2\nR0T2n\n: \u00f05\u00de\nComparing #b with the actual birth rate, b; we obtain the\neffective vaccination rate\n#p \u00bc\nb \u0005 #b\nb\n\u00bc 1\u0005\n#b\nb\n: \u00f06\u00de\nAvailable data for pertussis from New Zealand,\nEngland, Wales and the United States exhibit lengthen-\ning of the inter-epidemic periods and (at least tempor-\nary) decline of the infective maxima levels after mass\nvaccination was introduced. In New Zealand, the first\nmass vaccination schedule was put into place in 1960.\nDuring 1962\u20131976 there were observed 3\u20134 year cycles\nwith amplitudes lower than prior to mass vaccination\n(Cullen and Walker, 1997). The average period of 180\nweeks, or TnE41:5 parasite generations, corresponds\nto #bE0:00143; whereas the actual birth rate in\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA. Korobeinikov et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 224 (2003) 269\u2013275 273\nNew Zealand in this period was 22 births per thousand\nmean population annually (NZ Yearbook, 1998, p. 92),\nor bE0:00183: Comparing the actual birth rates with the\napparent birth rate #b; we obtain that effective vaccina-\ntion rates in New Zealand in this period were about 23%\nof newborns. The low values of amplitudes, typical for\nthis period, justify the use of Eq. (5).\nA similar picture was observed in the United King-\ndom during the same period. In England and Wales in\n1960\u20131976 (vaccination there reached a high level in\n1957) there were inter-epidemic periods of about 3\u20134\nyears (an average of 180 weeks or 41:5 parasite\ngenerations cycles) (Anderson and May, 1991; Anderson\net al., 1984), and the actual birth rate was about 20\nbirths per thousand population (US Bureau of Census,\n2002), or about b \u00bc 0:00167: Hence, the effective\nvaccination rates in the United Kingdom in this period\nwere also about 23% of newborns.\nAfter 1980, the inter-epidemic periods of pertussis in\nNew Zealand increased further. Epidemics occurred in\n1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1991, 1996 and 2000\u20132001\n(Cullen and Walker, 1997; NZ ESR, 1997), that is for\nthis period the inter-epidemic period extended from 4\n(48 parasite generations) to 5 (60 parasite generations)\nyears. After 1976, the birth rate dropped to 17 births per\nthousand population per year on average (NZ Year-\nbook, 1998, p. 92), or b \u00bc 0:00142: However, this\nlengthening of the epidemic cycle cannot be attributed\nto the birth rate decline alone. For the 5 years cycles,\nTn \u00bc 60; the apparent rate of new susceptibles influx\n#b \u00bc 0:00069; or the rate of effective vaccination of about\n52%: If we take Tn \u00bc 56 as an average value between 48\n(4-year cycle) and 60 (5-year cycle) parasite generations,\nfrom Eq. (5) we obtain the apparent rate of new\nsusceptibles influx #b \u00bc 0:00079: This value gives the\neffective vaccination rate of 44%:\nIn reality, however, this percentage is lower: the inter-\nepidemic period grows with amplitude, and after 1980\namplitudes of oscillations have been gradually increas-\ning. Judging by the number of hospitalizations, the ratio\nImax=IminE13 for the 1996 epidemic (Cullen and Walker,\n1997; NZ Health Information Service, 2000). In fact this\nvalue is even bigger since, instead of Imax and Imin values,\nthe total numbers of hospitalizations for 1994 and 1996\nhave been taken, and also pertussis is known to be\ngrossly underdiagnosed (Deeks et al., 1999). For the\nperiod since 1980, the ratio Imax=Imin > 20 can be\nconsidered as realistic in New Zealand. Table 2 gives\nvalues of the inter-epidemic periods for r \u00bc 0:015\n(which corresponds with the apparent birth rate #b \u00bc\n0:00094; or with the actual birth rate b \u00bc 0:00142 at the\nrate of effective vaccination of 33%). At Imax=IminE20;\nTable 2 gives TnE56; or a 412-year cycle. Further, for\nr \u00bc 0:013; or for the actual birth rate b \u00bc 0:00142 at\nthe rate of effective vaccination #pE0:43; or 43%; the\ncomputations give that TnE60 at Imax=IminE20:\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nThe model applied here appears extremely simple,\neven oversimplified. Nevertheless, it provides reliable\nestimation of the inter-epidemic period. Furthermore,\nthe inter-epidemic period appears to be a robust\ninvariant, and there is no specific limitation on the type\nof model applied.\nWe neglected seasonal effects: seasonality would very\nlikely be annual (as in measles) adjusting the epidemic\ncycle to the seasons and forming an epidemic cycle of\ninteger number of years. That is the seasonal effects\nare on a much shorter time-scale than the observed\nperiodicities which would therefore very likely be\nunaffected.\nThe obtained figures indicate that in New Zealand the\neffective vaccination rate against pertussis is lower\nthan 50%, and perhaps even as low as 33% of the\npopulation. These figures contradict the medical\nstatistics which claim that more than 80% of the\nnewborns in New Zealand are vaccinated against\npertussis (Turner et al., 2000). This contradiction is\ndue to the mentioned unreliability of the available\nvaccine. The fact that the fraction of immune popula-\ntion obtained here is considerably lower than the\nfraction of vaccinated population implies a high level\nof vaccination failure.\nWe believe that we can safely conclude that under the\ncurrent conditions (with the present vaccine and the\ncurrent vaccination practice) the effective vaccination\nrate against pertussis in New Zealand is considerably\nlower than is expected. Based on the present data it is\nperhaps lower than 50% of the population.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTable 2\nPeriod Tn vs. amplitudes for r \u00bc 0:015\nImin\nIn\nImax\nImin\nTn Imin\nIn\nImax\nImin\nTn\n0.002 4185 73 0.22 12.5 54\u201355\n0.004 1890 70\u201371 0.24 11 54\n0.006 1180 69 0.26 9.8 54\n0.008 840 68 0.28 8.75 54\n0.01 651 67 0.30 7.9 53\u201354\n0.02 283 64 0.35 6.2 53\n0.03 173 62 0.40 5.0 52\u201353\n0.04 121 61 0.45 4.2 52\u201353\n0.05 91.6 60 0.50 3.5 52\n0.06 72 59\u201360 0.55 3 52\n0.07 59.3 59 0.60 2.58 52\n0.08 50 58 0.65 2.25 52\n0.09 42.7 58 0.70 1.97 51\u201352\n0.10 37.1 57 0.75 1.73 51\u201352\n0.12 29.2 57 0.80 1.54 51\u201352\n0.14 24.6 56 0.85 1.38 51\u201352\n0.16 19.6 55\u201356 0.90 1.24 51\u201352\n0.18 16.7 55 0.95 1.1 51\u201352\n0.20 14.3 55 0.999 1.002\nA.
