Its spectrum could be explained by either a dusty warm absorber or a lack of broad-line\nclouds so that its appearance as a Seyfert 2 is intrinsic and not a result of absorption.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: Seyfert \u2013 galaxies: starburst \u2013 X-rays: galaxies.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of hidden Seyfert (Sy) 1 nuclei in many Seyfert 2\ngalaxies has given much support to the unified theories of Seyferts\n(e.g. see Antonucci et al. 1993 for NGC 1068). According to the\ncurrent unification models, both are identical objects which possess\na core-central black hole, accretion disc, broad-line region and a\nthick molecular torus. Objects observed within the opening angle\nof the torus are classified as Seyfert 1 objects, whereas those seen at\nangles intersecting the torus appear as Seyfert 2 sources. Around\nthe core is ionized gas (warm scatterer) which scatters the primary\nemission. In some cases nuclear starburst regions have been\nobserved. It should be pointed out that the unified theories explain\nthe differences between type 1 and type 2 Seyferts (and active\ngalaxies in general) phenomenologically, attributing any difference\nto orientation effects only. The X-ray data support the above\npicture. The X-ray spectra of X-ray selected Seyfert 2 galaxies (e.g.\nTurner & Pounds 1989; Smith & Done 1996; Turner et al. 1997)\nshow column densities much higher than those of Seyfert 1 objects.\nThese columns completely block the soft X-ray flux but become\ntransparent to energies>2 keV. Thus X-rays prove to be a powerful\ntool for the study of the type 2 (obscured) objects, because X-ray\nphotons can penetrate the obscuring medium and reveal the core to\nthe observer.\nSome objects, although classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies (e.g.\nNGC 1068 and Circinus; see Matt et al. 1997, 1999 respectively),\nappear to have no excess absorption. It has been shown that in such\ncases the direct component in the 2\u201310 keV range is suppressed as\na result of the fact that the torus is optically thick to Compton\nscattering, thus the hard X-ray photons in the 2\u201310 keV range are\nshifted to lower energies and are eventually absorbed after a few\nscatterings. In X-ray astronomy terminology these objects are\nclassified as Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxies. In such cases the\nemission from the nucleus can be inferred from the photons\nscattered from the warm scatterer and the inner surface of the torus\nitself (cold scatterer). Therefore Compton-thick objects can show\nlow obscuration below 10 keV. BeppoSAX observations with the\nPhoswich Detector System (PDS) have revealed that a power-law\nemerges through a high column density (.1024 cm22) above 10keV\nin several such cases. In such cases the obscuration is large enough to\ncompletely block the direct emission, leaving a low \u2018pseudo-\ncolumn\u2019 below 10keV, but small enough to allow transmission\nabove this energy. However, in some cases the column is so high\n(.1025 cm22) that the emission is not detected with the PDS. In\naddition, the observed equivalent width of the Ka iron line\nincreases as it is measured against a suppressed continuum.\n\u2020Present address: Institute for Astronomy, Royal Observatory, Blackford\nHill, Edinburgh EH9 3HT.\n\u2021Present address: Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Gardes\nStreet, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.\nPE-mail: apa@roe.ac.uk\nMon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 326, 995\u20131006 (2001)\nq 2001 RAS\nUntil recently, Seyfert 2 studies were restricted to relatively\nX-ray bright Seyfert 2, mainly taken from all-sky X-ray surveys,\nleading to a bias in favour of galaxies with low NH. Maiolino et al.\n(1998) studied a sample of X-ray weak Seyfert 2 galaxies selected\nby their [O III]l5007 flux and found that the average obscuration of\ntype 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is much higher than that\nderived by the former X-ray studies. This is because the\n[O III]l5007 flux is produced above or below the torus and\ntherefore can be considered to represent the central engine and thus\nprovide us with an unbiased sample of Seyfert 2 galaxies. Recently,\nRisaliti, Maiolino & Salvati (1999) studied a large sample of\n[O III]l5007 selected late-type Seyfert galaxies (Seyfert 1.8, 1.9,\n2.0; \u00bdO iii\u008al5007 . 40 \u0002 10214 erg s21 cm22\u00de. The galaxies came\nfrom Maiolino & Rieke (1995), complete with NGC 1808. Using\nX-ray data from the literature (with the exception of five objects,\nwhere the authors analysed the data), they showed that the average\ncolumn density for these objects is NH \u00bc 10\n23:5, with all the\nSeyfert 2 galaxies being obscured by columns with\nNH . 10\n22 cm22, giving strength to the simple model proposed\nby the unified theories. Furthermore, they showed that about half of\nthem are Compton-thick \u00f0NH . 10\n24 cm22\u00de and they confirmed\nthat intermediate type 1:8\u20131:9 Seyferts are characterized by an\naverage NH distribution lower than that of the genuine Seyfert 2\ngalaxies.\nAlthough the above standard model describes the spectrum of\nmost Seyferts very well, examples of Seyfert 2 galaxies were found\nrecently which challenge the unification scenarios. These show no\nintrinsic absorption (see, for example, Ptak et al. 1996 for NGC\n3147 and Bassani et al. 1999 for NGC 7590) while their high\nfHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a ratios are inconsistent with the idea of being Compton-\nthick objects (see Bassani et al. 1999). The peculiar spectra of these\nSeyfert 2s could be explained, for instance, either by the absence of\na broad-line region or by a high dust to (, neutral) gas ratio . In the\nformer case, their appearance as Seyfert 2s is intrinsic and not a\nresult of absorption. The lack of absorbing columns in these\ngalaxies raises important questions about the validity and\nuniversality of the standard AGN unification schemes. The\ndistribution of the absorbing columns in AGNs is also vital for\nmodels for the synthesis of the cosmic X-ray background (XRB;\ne.g. Comastri et al. 1995). It is evident that the range of column\ndensities of the absorbing material, its structure and geometry\nremain yet unconstrained and need to be determined with larger\nsamples of galaxies selected in different wavebands.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive and uniform X-ray\nanalysis with ASCA data of eight optically selected Seyfert 2\ngalaxies from the spectroscopic sample of Ho et al. (1997). While a\nfew of the objects analysed here have been retrieved from the\npublic ASCA database, some are presented here for the first time\n(NGC 1167, 2273, 3486 and 4698). Our goal is to explore the\nvalidity of the standard model and study the distribution of\nabsorbing columns in a sample with very accurately defined optical\nproperties, bona fide Seyfert 2. This paper is divided as follows: in\nSection 2 we introduce our sample; in Section 3 we describe our\nanalysis method; in Section 4 we present the results of the spectral\nanalysis; in Section 5 we discuss our results of the individual\nobjects; in Section 6 we discuss our results and in Section 7 we\nsummarize our main observational results.\n2 THE DATA\nWe present an analysis of eight optically selected Seyfert 2\ngalaxies observed with the ASCA satellite. The list of the data\nis presented in Table 1. The data come from both our own\nproprietary observations and from the ASCA archive. Our\ngalaxies are taken from the Ho et al. (1997) spectroscopic\nsample of nearby galaxies. This sample contains objects\nselected from the Revised Shapley-Ames Catalogue of Bright\nGalaxies (RSA; Sandage & Tammann 1981) with magnitude\nlimit Bt \u00bc 12:5mag in the northern \u00f0d . 08\u00de sky. As high\nsignal-to-noise and moderate- to high-resolution optical\nspectroscopy has been obtained for this sample, very accurate\nspectroscopic classifications exist for all galaxies. As a\nconsequence we can be confident that all our objects are\nbona fide Seyfert 2 galaxies. Our eight objects are selected on\nthe basis of their high [O III]l5007 flux. Some of our objects\n(see Table 1) have been previously analysed by other authors in\nthe hard X-ray band. However, here we re-analyse the data in\norder to present a uniform, comprehensive analysis of the\nbrightest [O III]l5007 selected Seyfert 2, for which X-ray data\nwere\/became available in the Ho et al. (1997) sample. An\n[O III]l5007 selected sample should be relatively free from the\nselection effects and biases that might appear through X-ray or\nother optical selection, such as intrinsic absorption or differ-\nences in viewing angle (Ueno et al. 1998). For five of the\nsources we were able to perform spectral analysis. For the other\nthree (NGC 1167, 1667 and 3486), insufficient X-rays were\ndetected for a full spectral analysis and we restrict ourselves to\na hardness ratio analysis.\nTable 1.

Pappa et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\n3 DATA REDUCTION\nWe utilized both the ASCA gas imaging spectrometer (GIS) and\nsolid-state imaging spectrometer (SIS) data. We used the standard\n\u2018Revision 2\u2019 processed data from the Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC) and data reduction was performed using FTOOLS. For GIS\ndata we used a circular source region centred on the source.\nBackground counts were estimated from source-free annuli centred\non the source cell. Because of calibration differences between the\nfour SIS chips, we limited our analysis to the on-source chip for\neach SIS. We used a circular extraction cell of 3\u20134 arcmin in radius.\nIn cases where the source was centred close to the gap between the\nchips, we followed the process described in the ASCA ABC guide\n(Yaqoob 1997). The background was estimated using rectangular\nregions at the source chip, excluding the source. In the case of NGC\n2273 where an additional serendipitous source close to the galaxy\nis detected, we used a circular source region of 1.5 arcmin in radius\nfor both the GIS and SIS in order to minimize any contamination\nby the nearby source.\n4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS\nThe spectral analysis was carried out using XSPEC v10. We bin the\ndata so that there are at least 20 counts in each bin (source plus\nbackground). The quoted errors to the best-fitting spectral\nparameters are 90 per cent confidence regions for one parameter\nof interest \u00f0Dx 2 \u00bc 2:71\u00de. We performed spectral fitting, allowing\nthe normalization for the SIS and GIS detectors to vary. The fluxes\nand luminosities given in the tables are referred to the GIS data.\nThroughout this paper, values of Ho \u00bc 75 km s\n21Mpc21 and qo \u00bc\n0:5 are assumed. From our analysis, we exclude all data below\n0.8 keV because of the uncertainties in the calibration matrices (see\nGeorge et al. 1998 for a discussion on this). We apply relatively\nsimple spectral models, so as to describe the properties of the\nwhole sample in the context of the unified model. We apply all the\nmodels to all the data sets even though the most complex models\nmay not be required in some cases. Where fits gave us absorption\nvalues consistent with the Galactic column density or lower we\nhave fixed the column to the Galactic value. The latter was\ndetermined using the FTOOLS program, which utilizes a map based\non 21-cm measurements and has resolution of about 0.7 degrees\n(see Dickey & Lockman 1990).\n4.1 Building the standard model\nWe have used the four major components of the \u2018standard model\u2019\nin steps:\n(i) we first apply a single power-law with absorption, if required,\nto all of our objects,\n(ii) we then add a Gaussian line representing the iron Ka\nemission,\n(iii) we add a second power-law component representing\nscattered emission, and finally\n(iv) a Raymond-Smith component at low energies representing a\nstar-forming component is added to the data.\n4.1.1 Single power-law model\nAccording to the current theories, the primary ultraviolet (UV) and\nsoft X-ray photons produced by the disc are Compton scattered by\na medium of hot electrons (,50 keV) and re-radiated at hard\nenergies. Such a process can produce a power law with an index of\nG , 1:9, in agreement with observational results, which suggests\nthat the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of Seyfert 1 galaxies is well\nrepresented by a power law with a \u2018canonical\u2019 spectral index with\nG , 1:9. In the case of Seyfert 2 galaxies, where our line of sight\nintersects the torus, we expect the spectrum to show a low-energy\ncut-off as well. We thus fit the data with a power-law model\nN\u00f0E\u00de dEaE2G dE, where N(E ) is the photon number density at\nenergy E. The photoelectric absorption A(E ) is parametrized by\nA\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc exp\u00bd2NHs\u00f0E\u00de\u008a where NH is the equivalent hydrogen\ncolumn and s(E ) is the photoelectric cross-section taken from\nMorrison & McCammon (1983). Fig. 1 shows the data and the\ndata\/model ratio after this model was fitted to each object. Rather\nunexpectedly, this model does provide an acceptable fit in two\ncases, where the absorption needed is either the Galactic value\n(NGC 3147) or relatively low (NGC 4698). An absorbed power-\nlaw model is clearly rejected by the NGC 2273 and M51 data. The\nmodel parameters are shown in Table 2. For the cases of M51,\nwhere the obtained spectral slope is unphysically steep, and NGC\n2273, where the slope is rather flat, we also fitted the model with\nthe slope fixed at the nominal value of G \u00bc 1:9, for comparison.\n4.1.2 Iron Ka line\nStrong evidence supporting the presence of an accretion disc in the\nvicinity of a black hole has been given by the detection of an\nasymmetric broad emission line at a rest energy of,6.4 keV in the\nSeyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15. This is interpreted as Ka iron\nemission originating by fluorescence in the very inner parts of an\naccretion disc, 3RS < R < 10RS, about a massive black hole of\nSchwarzschild radius RS (Tanaka et al. 1995). The profiles and\nintensities of the iron lines are expected to be complex\n(asymmetric, double peaked) but the sensitivity of the current\ndetectors cannot provide us with such detailed profiles for the\nmajority of the observed objects. In the Seyfert 2 galaxies,\nreprocessing of the nuclear radiation by the obscuring torus may\nalso contribute to the line flux. The mean equivalent width for a\nsample of Seyfert 2 galaxies studied with ASCA is 363^ 254 eV\n(Gilli et al. 1999).\nSome of our objects show line-like residuals in the 6\u20137 keV\nenergy range, providing evidence for an iron line, which we\nparametrize by a Gaussian line. For the purposes of our study the\nwidth of the line is fixed at s \u00bc 0:01 keV. This is smaller than\nthe instrumental response and thus is effectively monochromatic.\nThe addition of an iron line provides a significantly better fit (at\n>99 per cent confidence) for three of our objects (NGC 2273 and\n3147, and M51), although we note here that the line equivalent\nwidths determined may be strongly affected by the continuum\nshape and may be unphysical. The energy of the iron line is\nconsistent with that expected for cold iron for all of our objects in\nwhich the line is detected. No line was detected in the spectra of\nNGC 3079 or 4698, for which we give the 90 per cent upper limits.\nThe results are shown in Table 3.\n4.1.3 The scattering model\nAccording to the unified model, we expect that a fraction of the\nprimary emission should be Thomson scattered into our line of\nsight by a photoionized medium. The scattered spectrum has the\nsame shape as the incident spectrum. We note that in this work the\nterm \u2018scattering\u2019 always refers to scattering off the warm\nphotoionized medium. Optical polarimetric observations (Tran\nX-ray spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies 997\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\n1995) have shown that up to ,10 per cent of the primary emission\nis scattered. The above scenario can be modelled using two power\nlaws with the same photon index but different normalizations and\nabsorptions. The results are shown in Table 4. Again the energy of\nthe line is consistent with the expected 6.4 keV. For M51, we note\nthat the obtained slope is unphysically steep and, although the fit\nhas been improved, the model does not describe the data\nadequately. For NGC, 4698 although we obtain a good fit, the\nnormalizations of the two power-law components are comparable,\nand neither component requires any absorption below 10 keV. In\nthe case of NGC 3147 the column density is too high to be properly\nconstrained in the ASCA energy range. Finally, in the case of NGC\n2273, the normalizations of the scattered power-law component is\nalmost two orders of magnitude lower than that of the primary\npower-law component, suggesting ,2 per cent scattered flux, in\nagreement with what it is typically found to be for the obscured\nSeyfert galaxies (Sy 1:9\u20132:0\u00de.\n4.1.4 Composite model\nInfrared (Maiolino et al. 1995) and X-ray studies of Seyfert 2\ngalaxies (Turner et al. 1997) show that their host galaxies tend to\nhave energetic starburst regions. Indeed some of our objects show\nline-like residuals at soft energies, suggesting thermal emission\nFigure 1. The single power-law model. The top section of each panel shows the data with the model and the bottom section of each panel shows the data\/model\nratio. In the bottom part of the panels the spectral features are clear.\n998 A. Pappa et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\narising from hot gas. Thus we utilize an emission spectrum from\nhot, diffuse gas (Raymond model in XSPEC) to model the starburst\ncomponent, along with a single power law to account for the hard\nphotons. The temperature is set to be <1.0 keV, in order to\nconstrain the starburst contribution to the soft band. We fit NGC\n3079 and M51 with this model because these galaxies show\nevidence for thermal emission. In the case of M51, the thermal\ncomponent is absorbed by the Galactic column, whereas in NGC\n3079, excess absorption is required. This model gives a good fit for\nboth galaxies (see Table 5).\n4.2 The Compton-thick models\nIf the column density exceeds,1024 cm22, the obscuring medium\nis optically thick to Compton scattering and thus the primary\nemission is suppressed and we only observe the scattered emission\nfrom either the warm matter or the inner surface of the torus itself.\nFor the latter we use the term \u2018reflection\u2019. Here we will consider the\ncase where the Compton reflection from the inner surface of the\ntorus dominates the observed emission in the 2\u201310 keV energy\nband. We therefore utilize the PEXRAV model in XSPEC, which\ndescribes reflection occurring from a slab of neutral material\nsubtending a solid angle of 2p sr to an X-ray point source located\nabove the slab to account for the total hard X-ray emission, and a\npower law to represent the soft emission. For the purpose of this\nstudy we consider that the slope of the underlying power-law\nspectrum is 1.9, and assume Galactic absorption. The normal-\nization of the reflection is given by R \u00bc V=2p, whereV is the solid\nangle subtending by the reflector. However, as we cannot directly\nmeasure the intensity of the intrinsic power law which is being\nreflected, the value of R that we obtain is not physically\nmeaningful. Therefore we define the ratio A \u00bc R \u0002\nf \u00f02\u201310 keV\u00de\/ f \u00f02\u201310 keV\u00desc as an indicator of the fractional contribution\nthat would have been made to our observed spectrum after\ncorrection for absorption by the PEXRAV reflector. f \u00f02\u201310 keV\u00de is the\nflux that would have been produced by the underlying spectrum in\nTable 2.

NGC 1167, 1667 and 3486 did not give\nsufficient counts for a full spectral analysis to be performed. We did\nobtain a . 3s detection in the 2\u201310 keV band for both objects.\nClues for the spectral shape of the sources come from their\nhardness ratio. Here we define hardness ratio (HR) as\n\u00f0h2 s\u00de=\u00f0h1 s\u00de, where h and s are the total number counts in the\ndetection cells, in the 2\u201310 and 1\u20132 keV bands respectively. For our\nanalysis we chose to use GIS data only.\n5.1 NGC 1167\nThe hardness ratio of the source is 20:22^ 0:12, which\ncorresponds to a power law of G \u00bc 2:5^ 0:3 assuming Galactic\nabsorption. This corresponds to an observed flux in the 2\u201310 keV\nband of 4:0 \u0002 10214 erg s21 cm22 and a luminosity of 2:0 \u0002\n1040 erg s21: We note that the derived spectral index is rather\nsteeper than is typical for Seyfert galaxies, suggesting the possible\npresence of an additional soft component, possibly coming from a\nstarburst region in the vicinity of the AGN.\nThe low fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a \u00bc 0:23 ratio (see Section 6 for a detailed\ndiscussion on the implications of this ratio) for this source would\nsuggest a Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxy. On the other hand, the\nHR analysis showed that NGC 1167 has a steep spectrum, while in\nthe context of a Compton-thick interpretation we would expect a\nflat spectrum. Unfortunately, the HR analysis only provides an\nindication for the spectral shape and no information about multiple\ncomponents contributing to the spectrum. It is quite likely that the\nX-ray spectrum of NGC 1167 is complex, with different\ncomponents contributing to different energies. For example, a\nvery strong soft excess, possibly originating from intense star-\nforming activity, could produce a steep spectrum even if the\nemission from the central source is completely blocked by a\nCompton-thick absorption screen. However, because NGC 1167 is\ntoo faint for any further spectral analysis to be performed, the\nnature of its X-ray emission cannot be determined.\n5.2 NGC 1667\nNGC 1667 has shown a decrease of a factor of ,150 in the\n2\u201310 keV flux since its discovery (e.g. Polleta et al. 1996,\nTurner et al. 1997). The object is too faint to perform any\nspectral analysis. The hardness ratio of the source is\n20:52^ 0:14, which corresponds to a power law of\nG \u00bc 3:2^ 0:4. Assuming Galactic absorption the observed\n2\u201310 keV flux is then,8 \u0002 10214 erg s21 cm22, which corresponds\nto a luminosity of 1:3 \u0002 1041 erg s21. The slope is steeper than the\ncanonical for Seyfert galaxies and, again, some fraction of the\nemission could be attributed to starburst emission. Indeed,\nRadovich & Rafanelli (1996) find evidence for star formation\nwithin 10 kpc of this source, thus favouring the latter interpretation.\nThe low fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a \u00bc 0:1 ratio for this source would suggest that it\nis a Compton-thick candidate.\nThe substantial reduction in the hard X-ray flux over a ,20-yr\ntime-scale which has, presumably, not yet been reflected in the\nnarrow-line region would provide an alternative hypothesis to\nexplain the anomalous ratio. Indeed, assuming that the reduction in\nthe hard X-ray flux over a ,20-yr timescale has not yet been\nreflected in the narrow-line region (NLR), we find that the NLR in\nNGC 1667 should be located at .6 pc. Given that the NLR lies\n10\u2013100 pc from the central source, it appears that the substantial\nchange in the hard X-ray flux has indeed not reached the NLR yet.\nThis explanation is the most likely explanation of the low\nfHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a ratio and NGC 1667 is probably Compton-thin.\n5.3 NGC 2273\nThis galaxy has been studied by Maiolino et al. (1998) using\nBeppoSAX data. They found that their data are best fitted by a\nCompton-thick reflection-dominated model. In addition they did\nnot detect any emission with the PDS on board BeppoSAX and thus\nthey suggested that if the Compton-thick model is valid, then the\nTable 5.

The \u2018scattering\u2019 model provides a better fit to the ASCA\ndata (with a column close to 1024 cm22 and an equivalent width of\n,500 eV), and thus is our preferred fit. It is apparent from Fig. 1\nthat the flat spectrum originally obtained from a simple power-law\nfit is caused by a turn-up in the spectrum at energies above\n,5 keV. Indeed, a spectral fit over the restricted 0:2\u20135 keV range\ngives a good fit to a power law with a slope of 1:5^ 0:6, consistent\nwith the canonical AGN and our scattering interpretation. The ratio\nof the unobscured hard X-ray emission to the [O III]l5007\nemission is low, indicating that we do not observe the primary\nemission and the Compton-thick model described in the text, yields\na poor fit. It is likely that the spectrum of NGC 2273 is more\ncomplex. It is probable that a warm absorber medium and\/or\nstarburst emission contribute to the soft X-ray spectrum of this\nSeyfert 2, whereas the emission line around 6.4 keV could be a\nblend of iron lines. Unfortunately, the low quality of these data\ndoes not allow us to separate the components, which may\ncontribute to the NGC 2273 X-ray spectrum.\n5.4 NGC 3079\nThe Einstein Image Proportional Counter (IPC) detected NGC\n3079 at the 3.2s level (Fabbiano, Feigelson & Zamorani 1982),\nwith a flux of 3:7 \u0002 10213 erg s21 cm22: The ROSAT Position\nSensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) data are dominated by a\nnuclear point source but emission is detected up to 2.5 arcmin from\nthe nucleus (Reichert et al. 1994).

(1999) first presented the ASCA data for this galaxy.\nTheir best-fit spectral parameters have large uncertainties: the\npower-law G , 2:2012:0\n21:0 and NH < 6\n14\n25 \u0002 10\n21 cm22. The star-\nforming component was described by a Raymond\u2013Smith model\nwith kT \u00bc 0:14\u00f0, 0:54\u00de keV. Our analysis is in broad agreement\nwith Ptak et al. (1999), although the spectral index is somewhat\nflatter. Our best-fitting model is the \u2018composite\u2019 one (see Table 5),\nalthough no significant iron Ka emission is detected. No variability\nwas detected by Ptak et al. (1996), consistent with a Compton-thick\nscenario. Indeed, the X-ray to [O III]l5007 ratio supports either a\nCompton-thick interpretation or a substantial starburst contri-\nbution. Again, NGC 3079 seems to have a complex spectrum and\nthe nature of the X-ray emission cannot be determined with the\ncurrent data.\n5.5 NGC 3147\nEmission in the vicinity of NGC 3147 was detected at 3s byHEAO\n(Rephaeli, Gruber & Persic 1995), but no significant signal was\ndetected by Einstein, implying a decrease in the flux between these\ntwo observations. Ptak et al. (1996) first studied this object with\nASCA. They found that the data are well fitted by a simple power\nlaw with G \u00bc 1:9 and there is no indication for absorption. Our\nresults are in excellent agreement with those of Ptak et al. (1996).\nOur best-fitting model is the single power law with the iron line. In\nprinciple, other more complicated models such as the scattering\nmodel or the Compton-thick model provide equally acceptable\nx 2-values. In the case of the \u2018scattering\u2019 model we obtain a very\nlarge column of 1024 cm22 while the scattered emission is ,5 per\ncent of the primary component. However, such high columns\ncannot be probed by ASCA, thus we do not show the model\nparameters for this model in Table 4. In addition, the Compton-\nthick model provides an equally good representation of the data\nstatistically; here it is the scattering component which dominates\nthe fit. The absence of variability (Ptak et al. 1999) could in\nprinciple favour such models. However, although the above models\nprovide good fits to the data, they are rather contrived, as the ASCA\nbandpass does not allow us to constrain any models with an\nobscuring column higher than ,1024 cm22. Indeed, a single\npower-law model is identical to a scattering model with NH .\n1024 cm22 in the ASCA band as these columns absorb most photons\nbelow 10 keV. It is therefore interesting that the [O III]l5007\nemission does not favour the above two models (composite and\nscattering).\n5.6 NGC 3486\nThe hardness ratio is 0:29^ 0:12. This corresponds to a quite\nflat power law of G \u00bc 1:2^ 0:3, assuming Galactic absorption,\nwhich is suggestive of high amounts of obscuration. For\nexample, the well-known nearby Compton-thick AGNs (e.g.\nCircinus, NGC 1068) exhibit flat spectra below 20 keV as a\nresult of the combination of the reflection and the scattering\ncomponents. The observed flux, assuming Galactic absorption,\nis ,5 \u0002 10214 erg s21 cm22.\nWe carried out simulations in order to determine the amount of\nobscuring medium needed to obtain a change of G from 1.9 (which\nis the common value for AGNs) to 1.2. We found that the source\nshould be obscured by a column density of NH \u00bc 3:2 \u0002 10\n21 cm22.\nUsing G \u00bc 1:9 and NH \u00bc 3:2 \u0002 10\n21 cm22 we obtain an observed\nflux of ,5 \u0002 10214 erg s21 cm22, which corresponds to a luminos-\nity of ,5 \u0002 1038 erg s21. This is too low for a Seyfert galaxy,\nsuggesting high absorption in our line of sight (but see Roberts &\nWarwick 2000).\nThe [O III]l5007 ratio is relatively low (2.9). In order for the\nratio to be comparable to the ratios observed in Seyfert galaxies\n(see Section 6) the source should be obscured by a column density\nof ,1 \u0002 1024 cm22, assuming a power law of G \u00bc 1:9. This is\nmuch higher than the column derived from the HR analysis\nassuming G \u00bc 1:9. This indicates that the spectrum cannot repre-\nsented by a single power-law model, and that other components\ncontribute to the X-ray spectrum as well.\n5.7 NGC 4698\nNGC 4698 was observed using Einstein, and its 0:2\u20134:0 keV flux is\n2:8 \u0002 10213 erg s21 cm22. A detailed discussion on this object is\npresented in Section 6.\n5.8 M51\nM51 is known as the \u2018Whirlpool galaxy\u2019. The Einstein HRI\ndetected X-ray emission from M51 with a luminosity Lx \u00bc\n3:0 \u0002 1040 erg s21 in the 0:2\u20134:0 keV band. The emission is\nextended and the luminosity of a point source at the nucleus is\nX-ray spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies 1001\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\nL\u00f00:2\u20134:0 keV\u00de , 1:5 \u0002 10\n39 erg s21 (Palumbo et al. 1985). The\nROSAT PSPC spectrum of the M51 nucleus is fitted with a thermal\nplasma of kT , 0:4 keV (Marston et al. 1995; Read, Ponman &\nStrickland 1997), indicating that the AGN does not dominate the\nnuclear soft X-ray emission. The ROSAT PSPC observations\nrevealed extended emission (Ehle, Pietsch & Beck 1995). At the\nhard energies the Ginga data are fitted with a photon index of\nG \u00bc 1:4 and an X-ray luminosity of L\u00f02\u201320 keV\u00de \u00bc \u00f01:2^ 0:6\u00de \u0002\n1041 erg s21 from a ,1-deg2 field containing M51 (Makishima\net al. 1990). The data are also fitted with a kT \u00bc 7 keV thermal\nbremsstrahlung model plus a power law with G \u00bc 1:6 absorbed by\na column of 4 \u0002 1023 cm22. Terashima et al. (1998) analysed ASCA\ndata and found extended emission fromM51 in the 2\u20135 keV energy\nrange. They detected a soft thermal emission represented by either\nkT , 0:4 keV with low iron abundance, or by two kT plasmas\n(,0.3 and,0.8 keV). The hard emission is represented by a power\nlaw with G , 1:4 and ,1 respectively. The fact that extended\nemission is observed in the 2\u20135 keV band clearly suggests that the\nAGN emission contributes only to the hardest end of the ASCA\nspectrum and is either suppressed at the softer energies or is not the\ndominant contributor of the energy output at these energies.\nOur best-fitting model for M51 is the composite model with\nkT , 0:7 keV and a spectral slope of ,1.7. However, we obtained\nan upper limit for the column density of 1:6 \u0002 1021 cm22. This is\nnot sufficient to obscure the AGN X-ray emission up to,5 keV, as\nit is indicated by the analysis of the brightness profile of M51. The\nemission could be interpreted as the superposition of thermal\nemission at soft energies (below 2 keV), emission from low-mass\nX-ray binaries (LMXBs), which contribution dominates at the\n2\u20135 keV band and a power-law component from the AGN, which is\nrevealed above 5 keV. In this case the active nuclei should be\nobscured by a column of .5 \u0002 1023 cm22. However, since the\nAGN and the LMXBs both show a power-law spectrum of\nG , 1:7\u20131:8, it is possible that both components could be fitted as a\npower-law model with no need of excess absorption. On the basis\nof its [O III]l5007 flux, M51 is a Compton-thick candidate. We\nnote here that we also tried a Compton-thick model, with either two\nRaymond\u2013Smith models and a reflected continuum (PEXRAV\nmodel), or a Raymond\u2013Smith model, a power-law model to\naccount for the possible LMXB contribution and the reflection\ncomponent. However, although we obtained good fits the reflection\ncomponent did not contribute in the ASCA band leaving the\npossibility where the hard X-ray emission is dominated by a\nscattered component more plausible in this band.\n6 DISCUSS ION\n6.1 Are most of our objects Compton-thick ?\nA couple of our objects show no evidence for intrinsic absorption.\nWe note that in the case of poor photon statistics a Compton-thick\nobject could be misidentified as a low-NH, steep spectrum type-1\nAGN, especially if the steep scattered emission dominates over the\nreflected component.\nIt is thus possible that ASCA only \u2018sees\u2019 the scattered\ncomponent. Therefore, the lack of intrinsic absorption in some of\nour objects may indicate that these objects are Compton-thick.\nFurther clues on whether these AGN are Compton-thick can be\ngiven by studying the isotropic properties of the galaxy. In the case\nof an AGN as isotropic emission, we consider the infrared (IR) and\nthe hard X-ray emission (in the case of Compton-thin absorption)\nboth been able to penetrate the torus, and the [O III]l5007 line\nemission produced in the narrow line region, and thus free of\nviewing angle effects. Indeed, Alonso-Herrero et al. (1997) showed\nthat the 2\u201310 keV to [O III]l5007 and IR flux ratios are comparable\nfor obscured and unobscured AGNs. The advantage of studying\nisotropic properties then, is that they act as an indicator of the\nstrength of the nuclear source. Maiolino et al. (1998) have\nproposed that the measurement of the observed hard X-ray flux\n\u00f02\u201310 keV\u00de against the [O III]l5007 flux is indeed a powerful\ndiagnostic. Moreover, although the line is emitted on the NLR\nscales, the host galaxy disc might obscure part of the NLR and\nshould be corrected for the extinction deduced from the Balmer\ndecrement (Maiolino & Rieke 1995). The corrected [O III]l5007\nflux is given by the following relation (Bassani et al. 1999):\nF\u00bdOIII\u008acor \u00bc F\u00bdO iii\u008aobs\u00bd\u00f0Ha\/Hb\u00de=\u00f0Ha\/Hb\u00de0\u008a\n2:94 \u00f01\u00de\nAssuming an intrinsic Balmer decrement \u00f0Ha\/Hb\u00de0 \u00bc 3. All the\nwell studied Seyfert 1 galaxies have fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a > 1 (Maiolino\n1998). An absorption of less than a few times 1023 cm22 will\nlower this ratio by a factor of ,5 with respect to Seyfert 1s. When\nNH . 5 \u0002 10\n24 cm22, the reduction is about two orders of\nmagnitude. The flux ratios are presented in Table 7. For each\nobject we use the flux derived using the most plausible model. Of\ncourse we have to be cautious, as there may be some limitations on\nthe use of the [O III]l5007 flux ratio as an indicator of the\nunobscured X-ray emission. Indeed, in cases where the ionization-\ncone axis lies perpendicular or close to the minor axis there might\nbe lack of ionized gas. Then the [O III]l5007 flux may not be a\ngood indicator of the nuclear strength. However, the disc height for\na typical spiral galaxy is of the order of ,100 pc, whereas the size\nof the region where the bulk of the [O III]l5007 flux is produced is\nof a similar size. Thus it is most likely that the relative orientation\nof the nuclear accretion to the host galaxy disc will not\nsignificantly affect the [O III]l5007 flux. Another caveat that we\nshould take into account is if the torus hides the innermost regions\nof the NLR from our view, and thus the observed [O III]l5007 is\nlower than the actual flux produced. Again, the small inferred size\nof the torus (a few pc) relative to the size of the NLR (kpc scale)\nimplies that such an effect does not significantly affect the above\nratio. In addition, Mulchaey et al. (1994) compared the properties\nof samples of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies, and showed that the\nratio of the [O III]l5007 emission to the unobscured hard X-ray\nemission is the same for both types of galaxies, indicating that the\n[O III]l5007 flux cannot be obscured by the torus. In the case of the\nIR emission, caution must be taken because the IR emission may\nbe contaminated by starburst emission, particularly in the case of\nlow-luminosity AGN where the star formation in the host galaxy\ndominates the emission. Multiwavelength observations of our\nobjects have shown that some of them indeed contain starburst\nactivity (see Section 5). Therefore we choose not to apply this\ncriterion to our data.\nIn Table 7 it is noted whether the object is Compton-thin or\nCompton-thick, on the basis of both the X-ray spectral analysis and\nthe fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a ratio. It is clear that in some cases there is a\ndiscrepancy between the classifications inferred from the spectrum\nand the fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a ratio. It is likely that the X-ray spectrum of\nSeyfert 2 galaxies and especially those with high column densities,\nwhere the medium and hard X-ray photons are suppressed, and\nemission from the host galaxy, circumnuclear starburst and warm\nabsorbers significantly contributes to the spectrum. The present\n(ASCA ) data does not allow us to distinguish the contribution of\nthese components.\n1002 A. Pappa et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\nSummarizing, NGC 1167, 2273, 3079, and M51 are Compton-\nthick candidates according to their fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a ratio. The are best for\nthe three of them (NGC 2273, 3079, and M51) are best fitted with a\nhighly obscured \u00f0NH , 10\n23\u20131024 cm22\u00de power law. However,\nbecause of large uncertainties in the derived column density, we\nwere not able to distinguish between the Compton-thin and\nCompton-thick interpretations. This may be a result of the\nunderlying complexity of the X-ray spectra as shown more clearly\nin the case of M51. However, the current data, especially in the\ncase of NGC 2273, are only sufficient to support analyses with\nsimplistic models. NGC 3486 is probably a heavily obscured\nSeyfert 2 galaxy. Both NGC 3147 and 4698 have high fHX\/ f \u00bdOIII\u008a\nratios, comparable to the value obtained by Alonso-Herrero et al.\n(1997), if we take into account the extinction in the NLR, which\nclearly shows that the 2\u201310 keV X-ray emission is not affected by\nabsorption.\n6.2 Seyfert 2 galaxies with no absorption in X-rays: the case\nof NGC 4698\nThe most striking example from our low absorption Seyfert 2 is\nNGC 4698. The X-ray data do not require absorption and the\nalternative hypothesis of Compton thickness was ruled out on the\nbasis of the [O III]l5007 flux. Further evidence for the amount of\nobscuring material can be obtained by the iron-line emission. For\nCompton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies the average equivalent width\n(EW) value derived from ASCA data is 363^ 254 (Gilli et al.\n1999), whereas for Compton-thick objects the equivalent width can\nbe well above 1 keV (e.g. for NGC 6240, the iron Ka line has an\nEW , 1:58 keV\u00de. However, we do not obtain a significant\ndetection of line emission but can only set a 90 per cent upper\nlimit on the equivalent width of such a feature of 425 eV. This value\nis too low for a Compton-thick object, and in that sense the\nCompton-thick interpretation for this object can be ruled out.\nNGC 4698 is not the first Seyfert 2 galaxy found which shows no\nintrinsic absorption. Ptak et al. (1996) first studied NGC 3147\n(which is also included in our sample) with ASCA in the context of\nan AGN. They interpreted its X-ray emission as originating in a\nSeyfert 1 (no Seyfert classification was available at that time) or a\nheavily obscured Seyfert 2. Moreover, Bassani et al. (1999) showed\nthat NGC 7590 has negligible absorption in X-rays as well,\nalthough classified as a Seyfert 2 galaxy. Using the [O III]l5007\ncriterion, the latter authors ruled out the Compton-thick possibility\nfor both objects and suggested that these lack a broad-line region\n(BLR), so their appearance as Seyfert 2 is intrinsic and not a result\nof absorption. Thus optical classification as type 2 objects will be\nexplained by the presence of narrow emission lines only as a result\nof a lack of the broad-line region.\nMany models for the formation of broad-line clouds argue\ntowards a link to the disc (see Collin-Souffrin 1987 and Witt,\nCzerny & Zycki 1997), thus the existence of a class of objects\nwithout a BLR would set constraints on the conditions under which\na BLR is formed, as well as the properties of the disc. In particular,\nNicastro (2000) recently presented a model in which a standard\naccretion disc accreting at low rates is not expected to produce\nbroad emission lines. According to this model a vertical disc wind,\noriginating at a critical distance in the accretion disc, is the origin\nof the broad-line emission region. The disc wind forms for external\naccretion rates higher than a minimum value m\u02d9min below which a\nstandard disc is stable. For accretion rates _m . _mmin, the disc is\nunstable and a stabilizing, co-accreting \u2018disc\/corona1wind\u2019\nsystem forms. The minimum accretion rate is _mmin .\n0:3n\u00f0am\u00de21:8; where n \u00bc 0:06 is the efficiency of the accretion,\na \u00bc 0:1 is the viscosity coefficient and m is the mass of the black\nhole. This gives a minimum accretion rate of _m . _mmin ,\n\u00f01\u20134\u00de \u0002 1023 for m in the range 106\u2013109 M(. Providing that the\naccretion rate in NGC 4698 is low, this model explains the absence\nof broad emission lines. Assuming that the mass of the black hole\nresiding in NGC 4698 is the typical 106M( for Seyfert galaxies,\nthe X-ray luminosity in the 2\u201310 keV energy band \u00f02:2 \u0002\n1040 erg s21\u00de is ,3 orders of magnitude lower than the observed\nX-ray luminosities (,1043 erg s21) in Seyfert 1 galaxies. This\ndiscrepancy could easily be attributed to a lower accretion rate,\nwhich immediately explains the absence of broad emission lines in\nthe spectrum of NGC 4698.\nThe lack of column density could also be explained by the\npresence of a dusty warm absorber. The presence of dust accounts\nfor the optical obscuration of the broad-line region, whereas the\nlack of X-ray absorption is caused by the ionization state of\nthe absorber. In such a case cold absorption is no longer required.\nWe note here that when we discuss dusty warm absorber models we\nshould consider that there are two grain-destruction mechanisms\nthat must be taken into account. First, the sublimination of the\ngrains when they become too hot (,2000K) and secondly, thermal\nsputtering, which destroys the dust once the gas electron\ntemperature reaches 106K (Draine & Salpeter 1979; Laor &\nTable 7.

Assuming that the warm absorber is photoionized,\nthe gas temperature in a typical warm absorber where oxygen is\nhighly ionized is only T , 5 \u0002 104 K and thermal sputtering is\nnegligible. If collisional ionization plays a significant role, then\nT , 106 K and the dust will be destroyed. However, Reynolds et al.\n(1997) showed that photoionization dominates the ionization of the\nplasma unless r $ 100 pc, where r is the distance of the warm\nabsorber from the central engine. In this case a dusty warm\nabsorber model is viable. Komossa & Bade (1998) predicted the\npresence of a carbon edge at 0.28 keV and showed that the dusty\nwarm absorber smoothes the oxygen edges, making it difficult to\nbe detected. Unfortunately ASCA is not sensitive enough at these\nsoft energies, and we cannot test an actual dusty warm absorber\nmodel for our data. As at energies above 0.3 keV both the dusty\nwarm absorber and the warm absorber are expected to imprint\nsimilar spectral features in the spectrum and because the X-ray\nphotons are not affected by the dust, we fit our data in the energy\nrange 0:5\u201310 keV with a warm absorber model in order to examine\nthe possibility of the presence of ionized material in the very\ncentral region of NGC 4698. Although we obtain a good fit to the\ndata \u00f0x 2 \u00bc 244:8 for 265 d.o.f), the ionization parameter of the\nwarm material is unphysically high, implying that the data do not\nrequire any kind of absorption. Further clues on the nature of this\ngalaxy can be given by looking for short-time variability in the\n2\u201310 keV band. The data do not show evidence for variability,\nhowever we note that this could simply be caused by our limited\nphoton statistics.\nAn insight into the energy production mechanisms at different\nwavebands can come from the spectral energy distribution (SED)\nof the galaxies. The SED for NGC 4698 (Fig. 2, stars) reveals an\nunexpected emission distribution compared to the median radio-\nquiet (Fig. 2, solid line) SED of Elvis et al. (1994). For comparison\nwe also show the SED of the archetypal Compton-thick Seyfert 2\ngalaxy NGC 1068 (Fig. 2, squares). It is clear that the NGC 4698\nSED deviates from both the typical and the Compton-thick AGN\nSEDs. The latter confirms our analysis that NGC 4698 is not a\nCompton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxy.\nTo investigate the differences we computed the \u2018optical\/X-ray\u2019\nspectral index (Tananbaum et al. 1974) aox between 2500 A\u02da\nand 2 keV, which is defined as: aox \u00bc 20:384 log\n\u00bdFv\u00f02 keV\u00de\/Fv\u00f02500 \u0017A\u00de\u008a: As there are no measurements in the\nUV, we made the conservative assumption that there is no UV\nbump and we extrapolate from the optical into the UVas a straight\nline in the nFn space. Then aox , 2:5. Typically it is found that\naox , 1:4 for AGNs. It is evident that NGC 4698 is relatively weak\nin the X-ray. However, as has already been shown, there is evidence\nthat the weakness is intrinsic and nota result of absorption, unless\nthe UV and or X-ray emissions vary significantly. We then\ncomputed the IR\/HX ratio as defined by Mulchaey et al. (1994) and\nobtained ,1.5. This is an upper limit because the flux at 25mm is\nan upper limit. However, it is clear that the ratio is comparable to\nthat of Seyfert galaxies (Mulchaey et al. 1994). The discrepancy\nbetween the SED of NGC 4698 and that of other AGNs could be\nexplained by either an excess in the optical emission or by a deficit\nin both the IR and X-ray emission. However, caution must be taken\nin interpreting the SED, as the measurements have been taken at\ndifferent epochs and using different apertures.\n6.3 The distribution of absorbing columns and the\nimplications for the X-ray background\nThe X-ray background is believed to be produced by the\nsuperposition of discrete sources. In the soft band, at a flux limit\nof 1 \u0002 10215 erg cm22 s21, the dominant population are broad-line\nAGNs (Hasinger et al. 1998). ASCA resolved only,30 per cent of\nthe 2\u201310 keV XRB into discrete sources (Georgantopoulos et al.\n1997), the majority of which are again broad-line AGNs. However,\nbroad-line AGNs have power-law spectra with a photon index of\nG , 1:9 (Nandra & Pounds 1994), which is significantly softer\nthan that of the CXB in that band (,1.4; Gendreau et al. 1995).\nThus there must be a large number of undetected objects which\nhave harder X-ray spectra than the local broad-line AGNs. This\npopulation should be obscured because it does not come up in the\nsofter energies.\nThe deep Chandra surveys deepened the riddle of the origin of\nthe XRB even further. In the hard 2\u201310 keV band, they probed\nfluxes at least an order of magnitude deeper than ASCA\n(Mushotzky et al. 2000), albeit with limited number statistics\nbecause of the small field-of-view of Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS) onboard Chandra. A large fraction of the\ndetected sources is associated with quasi-stellar objects (QSOs)\nwhich appear to have steep spectra. Surprisingly, no numerous,\nclear-cut examples of the putative obscured AGN population at\nhigh redshift have yet been found. Instead, two \u2018new\u2019 populations\nemerged which are associated with either early-type galaxies or\nextremely faint optical counterparts.\nAll the current models which try to reconstruct the X-ray\nbackground spectra utilize a population of objects with an\nunderlying spectral index equivalent of those of unobscured AGNs\nand a range of obscuring columns. Observational support for such a\nmodel comes from the detection in deep ROSAT surveys (Boyle\net al. 1995) of a large number of faint X-ray sources whose optical\ncounterparts are galaxies with narrow lines only. Thus these\ngalaxies are considered to be that \u2018obscured\u2019 AGN population. In\naddition, the lack of a population with spectral index similar to the\nX-ray background again indicates that a large population of heavily\nobscured AGN should emerge at hard energies.\nOur analysis suggests that simple models cannot describe the\nspectra of the Seyfert 2 galaxies adequately. Especially in the case\nFigure 2. The NGC 4698 SED (star symbols). The fluxes are taken from\nNED. Where there are multiple observations, we used data obtained using\nthe smallest aperture. Specifically, V-band magnitude 11.39 (64.9-arcsec\naperture), I-band magnitude 10.54 (36-arcsec aperture) and H-band\nmagnitude (51.8-arcsec aperture), for comparison we also show the NGC\n1068 SED (square symbols) and the median SED (line) from Elvis et al.\n(1994).\n1004 A. Pappa et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 326, 995\u20131006\nof heavily obscured or Compton-thick objects, where the medium\nand\/or hard X-ray emission is suppressed and emission from the\nhost galaxy, circumnuclear starbursts and\/or warm absorbers\ncontributes significantly and imprints features on the spectrum.\nAlso, surprisingly, two of our Seyfert 2s (NGC 3147 and 4698) do\nnot show evidence for absorption above the Galactic level. It\nbecomes evident that the complexity of the Seyfert 2 spectrum\nshould be taken into account when constructing models for the\nsynthesis of the X-ray background.\nIn addition, latest results from ASCA and BeppoSAX (Pappa et al.\n2001 and Comastri et al. 2001, respectively) show that there is a\npopulation of objects at high redshifts, with broad lines in the optical\nregion which have high amounts of X-ray absorption. All the above\nresults suggest that the distribution of column densities is complex,\nand one cannot use a simple recipe for the NH distribution. The\ncompilation of large optically selected or IR selected Seyfert 2\nsamples and the determination of the X-ray spectrum of Seyfert 2\ngalaxies, as well as the study of obscured AGN at high redshift, will\nshed new light on the X-ray background synthesis models.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented a systematic analysis of eight bona fide Seyfert\n2 galaxies. We selected sources from the Ho et al. (1997)\nspectroscopic sample of nearby galaxies. We included all the\nbrightest [O III]l5007 Seyfert 2 galaxies, for which X-ray data\nwere or recently became available. Our uniform analysis showed\nthat, in general, our objects show a complex X-ray spectrum. On\nthe basis of the [O III]l5007 flux, the Compton-thick possibility\nwas ruled out for two of our low-absorption objects, namely NGC\n3147 and 4698, leaving open questions as to the nature of these\nobjects. We propose that the deficit in absorption may be caused\neither by the presence of a dusty warm absorber or by the lack of\nbroad-line region. In the latter case the Seyfert 2 appearance is\nintrinsic and an absorption medium is no longer required.\nFurthermore, for NGC 2273, spectral analysis favours the\nscattering model. However, the column density could not be\nconstrained, thus we could not distinguish between the Compton-\nthin and Compton-thick interpretations. Yet its [O III]l5007 flux is\ntoo low, and favours the Compton-thick interpretation. In the case\nof M51, where the reflection-dominated Compton-thick model is\nnot favoured by the data but its fHX\/ f \u00bdO iii\u008a is low, we argue that the\ndiscrepancy may be explained either by a warm scatter model for\nthe hard X-ray emission, or by optical or X-ray variability. Finally,\nwe suggest that the above results may be important in the study of\nthe X-ray background, because all the current XRB synthesis\nmodels utilize a population of objects with an underlying spectral\nindex equivalent to that of unobscured AGNs and a range of\nobscuring columns, whereas our results suggests that there are type\n2 objects with spectra quite untypical of the ones expected and that\nthe X-ray spectrum is composed by several components (which\nshould be taken into account when constructing such models).\nDiscovery of more Seyfert 2 galaxies with spectra distinct to the\n\u2018nominal\u2019 Seyfert 2 spectra will show whether these objects\ncontribute significantly to the X-ray background or not, while\nXMM-Newton observations of Seyfert 2 galaxies will allow us to\ndetermine the spectral components contributing to the total X-ray\nspectrum and Chandra observations will allow us to deconvolve\nany extended emission.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the referee R.
