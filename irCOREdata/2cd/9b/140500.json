Be-\ncause the thickness is taken as small and all the stresses \nare zero on the 2 x-z and y-z surfaces, these stresses cannot \ndiffer appreciably from zero in the interior and give\n s s sz yz xz= = = 0.  (13)\nsimilarly, because the width is considered very small, \nthe stresses are\n s s sy xy yz= = = 0.
