Evaporite rocks have much \nhigher solubilities and faster dissolution rates than carbonate rocks and they also \ncommonly have lower mechanical strengths and more ductile reheologies. Many of \nthese factors are dependent on the local hydrogeology, and when combined they can \nresult in areas where karst features evolve on a human time scale, rather than a \ngeological timescale. Karst collapse and subsidence are common in such areas, making \nthem problematical for the local population. The evaporite-karst environment is very \nsensitive to changes in the local hydrology and hydrogeology, so that human factors \nsuch as groundwater extraction, drainage, and irrigation can act as triggering events for \nkarst collapses. Some evaporite-karst features such as caves and saline springs have \nbeen beneficially exploited, but most of them, including sinkholes, subsidence, and \ngroundwater degradation, pose a threat to the local environment and a hazard to \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe papers in this special issue of Environmental Geology arose from a successful \nsession on Evaporite Karst convened by us at the Sixth International Conference on \nGeomorphology. This was held in Zaragoza, Spain, in September 2005 and was \norganised by Zaragoza University and the International Association of \nGeomorphologists (IAG; http:\/\/www.geomorph.org\/). Authors of the twenty-eight \npresented abstracts were invited to submit full papers to this special issue. Nineteen \npapers were proposed and sixteen papers have been accepted and are published here.  \n \nThese papers cover a wide geographical canvas, including studies on  aspects of \nevaporite karst in the USA, Albania, Great Britain, Italy, Iran, and Spain. The papers are \ngrouped into three board categories. The first group of papers provide national or \nregional overviews of evaporite karst. Johnson, in his first paper, outlines the main \nevidence of evaporite dissolution in the contiguous United States, where about 40% of \nthe land is underlain by these soluble rocks. This contribution presents spectacular \nexamples of catastrophic subsidence induced by human activities that cause fresh water \nto flow through salt formations; these human activities include drilling of petroleum \ntests, solution-mining, and underground mines. The second paper by Johnson, \ncharacterizes the problems that gypsum karst may pose on lakes and reservoirs, and \ndescribes four examples in which the presence of karstified gypsum at a dam site and\/or \nthe impoundment area has led to abandonment of the project, collapse of the dam, or \nsubstantial leakage. Guti\u00e9rrez et al. review the geological and environmental \nimplications of evaporite karst in Spain. Here, the interstratal karstification of evaporites \nhas generated large-scale subsidence structures and dissolution-collapse breccias, which \nconstitute major regional aquifers. Quaternary alluvium deposited in fluvial valleys that \noverlie evaporites locally thicken dramatically to fill dissolution-induced basins more \nthan 100 m deep. The origin of some of the most important lake systems in Spain is also \nrelated to evaporite dissolution. Moreover, Spain has a large number of outstanding \ncaves developed in gypsum and rocksalt. The main environmental issues related to \nevaporite karst in Spain include sinkhole hazards, mass movements from karstified \ngypsum scarps, severe hydrochemical degradation of surface waters, and pollution and \ndestruction of caves. Parise et al. describe karst features developed in the main evaporite \noutcrops of Albania and document the principal environmental problems, including \nwater pollution and destruction of caves by quarrying. Liguori et al. provide and \noverview of evaporite karst in Sicily and also document the hydrochemical degradation \nof the River Platani, caused by brines derived from an abandoned salt mine. Water \ncirculation and dissolution in this mine is renewed by the ingress of fresh water through \nsinkholes that result from the collapse of mine galleries. Cooper presents the GIS-based \nkarst inventory of Great Britain that is being constructed by the British Geological \nSurvey. The database has been used to generate a national karst-hazard susceptibility \nmap. Both the database and the susceptibility zonation will be a reference for other \ncountries and will be of great use for planners, developers, and the insurance industry. \n \nThe second group of papers deal with sinkhole hazards, providing general insights or \nsite-specific studies. Guti\u00e9rrez et al. present a methodological review of the assessment \nand mitigation of sinkhole hazards in evaporite-karst areas, highlighting the importance \nof quantitatively evaluating  the temporal-spatial probability of sinkhole occurrence in \ndifferent areas through the generation and validation of hazard models. In the next \npaper, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. propose a new genetic classification of sinkholes applicable to \nboth evaporite- and carbonate-karst areas, based on the study of paleokarst features \nexposed in several Spanish Tertiary basins. This classification scheme describes \nsinkhole types by the use of two terms that refer to the material affected by downward \ngravitational movement (cover, bedrock, or caprock) and the main process involved \n(collapse, suffusion, or sagging). The studied exposures indicate that the sagging \nmechanism, not included in previous classifications, plays an important role in the \ngeneration of sinkholes in evaporite-karst areas. The paper by Lucha et al. is primarily \nfocused on the impacts of mining activity on salt karst of the Cardona Diapir in Spain. \nHere, the alteration of surface and underground hydrology by mining operations has led \nto the generation of several human-induced caves up to 4300 m long. In March 1998, \nthe interception of a phreatic conduit by a mine gallery caused the inrush of fresh water \nfrom the Cardener River, causing flooding of the mine, massive dissolution, and the \ngeneration of a large number of sinkholes. Buchignani et al. investigate the causes and \nfactors involved in the sudden occurrence of a catastrophic collapse sinkhole 30 m \nacross in Camaiore village (Tuscany, Italy). This sinkhole, formed 5 days after an \nearthquake was felt in the area, resulted from the upward propagation of a dissolutional \ncavity through more than 100 m of alluvium. In some of the valleys that perpendicularly \ntraverse  the halite-bearing evaporite core of the Barbastro Anticline (NE Spain), Lucha \net al. document evidence of halokinesis, as well as  past and currently active \ndissolution-induced subsidence. Here, Quaternary terrace deposits locally show \nanomalous thickening (>100 m) generated by dissolution-induced subsidence and \ndeformation produced by the upward flow of salt. The detrimental effects and \nmitigation of subsidence on canals and buildings in Ivars de Noguera is the other main \ntopic of this contribution. Simon et al. contrast past and present-day subsidence activity \nin an area of the Ebro River valley (Spain), comparing the density of paleosinkholes \nexposed in Quaternary alluvial deposits (mostly mantled pediments) and the density of \nsinkholes mapped in terrace surfaces. They also analyse the spatial and temporal \nevolution of sinkholes using aerial photographs from different dates and subsidence \nmeasurements in active sinkholes. Mochales at al. explore the applicability of magnetic, \nlow-frequency Ground Penetrating Radar and microgravimetry techniques by studying a \nburied collapse sinkhole filled with urban debris in the Ebro River valley (Spain). \n \nThe final group of articles study erosion rates in salt exposures and speleothems in \ngypsum caves. Bruthans et al. used plastic pegs to measure denudation rates on salt-\ndiapir surfaces located in different climatic settings of the Zagros Mountains. \nMotthershead et al. obtain accurate measurements of surface erosion in salt slopes in the \nCardona Diapir of Spain and analyse the control of several topographical factors on the \nerosion rates. Finally, Calaforra et al. analyse the influence of climate on the \nmineralogical composition of speleothems deposited in gypsum caves, and illustrate \nhow these chemical deposits may be used for paleoclimatic investigations. \n \nThe guest editors of this special issue would like to thank all the contributors to the \nZaragoza conference, the authors of papers, and the many referees for their efficient and \ngenerous work towards producing this collection of papers.
