INTRODUCTION\nIce streams are a dynamic component of the West Antarctic\nice sheet (WAIS) system, draining as much as 90% of the\nAntarctic ice sheet (Morgan and others, 1982). It is likely\nthat ice streams will be sensitive to changes in the ice sheet,\nclimate and sea level and may be the regions of the WAIS\nwhere the effects of any change may be first observed. In\nattempts to identify forcing on the system, recent studies\nhave concentrated on the ice-stream\/ice-shelf interface,\nsuggesting that grounding-line migration may indicate\n(in)stability (e.g. Budd and others, 1984; McInnes and Budd,\n1984; Anandakrishnan and others, 2007). Another zone of\npotentially significant change is the ice-stream onset region.\nHere the ice-flow speed increases rapidly, from typical slow-\nmoving inland ice-sheet velocities (possibly dominated by\ndeformation within the ice column) to those speeds\ncharacteristic of an active ice stream (with an increased\ndegree of basal sliding and\/or sediment deformation at the\nbase). An outstanding question is, how stable are these\nzones of onset? Two components play a role in this stability:\n(1) glacier flow dynamics and (2) surface accumulation\npatterns. Rapid change in flow dynamics may be controlled\nby changes in the subglacial hydrological and\/or subglacial\nsediment regime. Sudden and pronounced changes in\naccumulation may be generated by changing patterns of\nprecipitation, as well as redistribution of snowfall due to\nwind scour and transport.\nRadar profiles on ice sheets commonly reveal change in\nflow regime or the patterns of accumulation through\nexamination of isochrones identified from radar reflections\n(Richardson and others, 1997; Vaughan and others, 2004).\nThese layers are believed to be generated from density\n(Robin and others, 1969) and chemical differences in the ice\nand firn (e.g. Paren and Robin, 1975). This study aims to\nassess recent stability, in terms of flow velocity and\naccumulation, at the onset region of Rutford Ice Stream,\nWest Antarctica, from analysis of internal isochrones in\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) and Deep-Look Radio Echo\nSounder (DELORES) profiles.\n2. FIELD SITE\nRutford Ice Stream drains a catchment area of the WAIS from\nthe Ellsworth Mountains, flowing into the southwest corner\nof the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf (Fig. 1). In the upstream area\nof the ice stream, known as the onset region, flow\naccelerates from 65 to 110ma\u20131 (King and others, 2004).\nThe survey is centred on 76854059\u2019\u2019 S, 88806018\u2019\u2019W at a\nzone of convergence where flow is channelled from a wide\ncatchment basin above the Ellsworth Mountains into the\nhead of the ice stream. Downstream of the onset region the\nice-stream margins are largely topographically controlled,\nwith a deep trough running south between the Ellsworth\nMountains and Fletcher Promontory. Snow accumulation\ndata from a site 40 km to the west show that accumulation\nrates have varied between 0.34 and 0.39ma\u20131w.e. over the\nperiod 1780\u20132001 (Kaspari and others, 2004).\n3. METHODOLOGY\n3.1. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)\nApproximately 66 km of 100MHz pulseEKKO GPR profiles\nwere collected in the onset region of Rutford Ice Stream\nduring austral summer 2002\/03. Profiles were collected in\ncontinuous mode and comprised a 26 km long line parallel\nto flow, together with a 40 km transverse line (Fig. 1).\nAnnals of Glaciology 50(51) 2009 57\nProcessing involved drift correction, time zero correction,\ndewow and bandpass filtering, background removal and\napplication of a time-varying automatic gain. A value for\nradar wave speed of 0.194mns\u20131 was applied for depth\ncorrections, following common-midpoint (CMP) calcula-\ntions by Nath and Vaughan (2003) for GPR data on Rutford\nIce Stream at a similar elevation. This average will under-\nestimate near-surface depths and very slightly overestimate\nthe depth of deeper layers.\n3.2. Deep-look radar (DELORES)\nOver 45 km of deep-look radar data were acquired with the\nBritish Antarctic Survey\u2019s DELORES system during austral\nsummer 2004\/05. DELORES is a monopulse radar capable\nof operating between 1 and 20MHz. The transmitter\ncomprised a Kentech pulse generator that produced\n\u00022000V pulses at a repetition rate of 1\u20135 kHz. The data\npresented here were acquired with dipole antennae of 40m\nlength that have a peak frequency of 1MHz. The receiving\nsystem comprised an identical antenna pair coupled to a\ndigital oscilloscope via a balun and amplifier. Three\nthousand pulses were stacked for each trace. Processing\ninvolved bandpass filtering, a gain function, a two-\ndimensional (2-D) median filter to remove noise spikes\nand Kirchhoff migration. We used a constant wave speed of\n0.167mns\u20131 for migration and depth conversion. This\nspeed is optimal for migration of diffractions from the bed\nand for correcting the slope of deeper layers but is not\noptimal for migration in the shallower section. No CMP\ninformation is available to provide guidance on a 2-D\nvelocity model, so we have elected to use a constant wave\nspeed throughout the record.\n4. RADAR RESULTS\n4.1. GPR profiles\nThe GPR profiles display a set of internal reflectors to a depth\nof up to 150m (Fig. 2). Reflections indicate that:\nThe pattern of near-surface reflections is controlled by\naccumulation, which appears to be controlled mainly by\nsurface topography. Some layers are continuous and can\nbe traced throughout the 26 km length of the flow-\nparallel profile. The reflections are further apart on\nupstream-facing slopes than on downstream-facing\nslopes. In places (e.g. between 9 and 12 km on the\nalong-flow line (Fig. 2)), some reflections on the down-\nstream-facing slopes are difficult to trace, and lose\ncoherence, as the layer thickness drops below the\nresolution of the GPR.\nFig. 1. Location of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, showing the location of GPR lines (white lines) and DELORES profiles (black lines).\nInset magnification of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) image shows the direction of wind tails (southeast\u2013\nnorthwest) generated by storm conditions behind nunataks at the northwestern end of the Ellsworth Mountains.\nFig. 2. GPR long profile running down the centre line of the ice\nstream. The wave-like pattern reflects accumulation differences\nlinked to surface elevation. Modelled particle paths originating at\nthe accumulation maxima at 4 and 12 km and the accumulation\nminimum at 7 km are plotted as solid lines. Open circles mark the\nmaximum two-way travel-time (TWTT) difference between pairs of\nisochrones, and closed circles mark the minimum difference. See\ntext for full explanation of the model.\nWoodward and King: Radar surveys of the Rutford Ice Stream onset zone58\nAreas of high accumulation on the upstream slopes\ngenerate trough-like structures that propagate through\nthe depth of the GPR profile.\nFrom 10 to 40 km on the cross-flow line, reflections can\nbe traced throughout the GPR profile and are near-\nparallel to the surface.\nBetween 2 and 10 km on the cross-flow line, there is a\nchange in the reflection pattern (Fig. 3b). Zones of infill\nare apparent, with \u2018foreset\u2019 layers filling hollows in the\nprofile from the southern edge of the profile (Fig. 3c).\n4.2. DELORES profiles\nThe flow-parallel and perpendicular DELORES surveys in the\nsame area reveal internal layering to the bed of the ice\nstream at \u00032200m depth (Figs 3 and 4). Reflections indicate\nthat:\nThe zone of infill structures lies directly above a series of\nsteps in bedrock topography (associated with the ice-\nstream margin). Ice thickness increases from \u00031500m to\n>2200m. This also creates a trough in the surface\ntopography.\nThere are a series of infill structures between prominent\nreflection horizons that extend for considerable spatial\ndistances (Fig. 4).\nThe flow-parallel and perpendicular DELORES lines\nindicate that the infill patterns resemble foresets de-\nposited from a southeasterly direction.\nThe trough in which the foresets are deposited follows a\nbasal low, channelling ice flow into the main flow of the\nice stream.\n5. INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION\n5.1. Long-profile isochrone pattern\nGPR profiles reveal a series of near-surface layers to depths\nof \u0003150m. DELORES surveys along the same transects\nreveal internal layering to the bed of the ice stream at\n\u00032200m depth. We interpret this layering as representing\nannual depositional isochrones (following Richardson and\nothers, 1997; Vaughan and others, 2004). Relative accumu-\nlation along the profile has been estimated by tracing an\nannual near-surface layer (isochrone), giving a baseline\naccumulation of 0.43\u00020.02mw.e. a\u20131. Assuming accumu-\nlation over the last 200 years has remained constant, the\ndevelopment of firn layers can be predicted in an along-flow\ndirection following the methods of L. Gray and others\n(http:\/\/neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov\/wais\/pastmeetings\/PPT05\/\nGray.ppt):\nV \u00bc Vi \u00fe kx, \u00f01\u00de\nwhere V is the downstream velocity variation, Vi is initial\nFig. 3. GPR and DELORES images of the infill feature near the southern margin of the ice stream. (a) 1MHz DELORES data showing a rapid\nchange in basal topography from 1000m depth at the southern end of the profile, with a steep slope to the ice-stream bed at >2200m to the\nnorth of the line.

The inset (c) shows the reflections onlapping from south to north. (d) DELORES data bandpassed between 10\nand 20MHz.

Velocity along\nthe GPR profile is known from global positioning system\n(GPS) measurements that show flow acceleration from 65 to\n110ma\u20131 along the profile. Assuming that close to the\ncentre of the ice stream the transverse strain rate is zero, a\n1m distance across-flow stays as 1m, so the simulation is\ntwo-dimensional (along-flow and vertical).

Particle paths originating at three locations\nwere calculated for the last 200 years, plotted as solid lines\nin Figure 2. The origin points are the two accumulation\nmaxima at 4 and 12 km and the accumulation minimum at\n7 km. The end-points of the particle path lines would ideally\nall coincide with one isochrone on the GPR profile. The\ndegree to which they do not gives a measure of the error of\nthe method. In order to trace the accumulation maxima and\nminima down the record, we determined the travel time\ndifference between pairs of isochrones and plotted the\nmaximum difference as open circles, and the minimum\ndifference as filled circles, in Figure 2. The close corre-\nspondence between modelled particle paths and the locus\nof the accumulation maxima and minima suggests that the\nassumption of constant flow velocity and constant accumu-\nlation pattern for the time period is valid. The fit is not as\ngood as for other data, such as those collected on\nBindschadler Ice Stream (L. Gray and others, http:\/\/\nneptune.gsfc.nasa.gov\/wais\/pastmeetings\/PPT05\/Gray.ppt).\nThis is most likely due to errors in the velocity profile\npropagating through into longitudinal strain-rate variations\nor errors in the accumulation estimates. For most of the\nFig. 4. Two perpendicular DELORES lines showing a series of infill structures between prominent reflection horizons. The infill patterns\nresemble foresets deposited from a southeasterly direction, the dominant direction of storm winds.\nWoodward and King: Radar surveys of the Rutford Ice Stream onset zone60\ncross-flow line, isochrones appear continuous and near-\nparallel to the surface. We interpret the modelling results as\nindicating approximate steady-state flow conditions in the\ncentral part of the ice-stream onset zone for the last\n200 years.\n5.2. Anomalous fill patterns near ice-stream margin\nBetween 2 and 10 km on the GPR cross-flow line, there are a\nseries of depressions in the isochrone pattern (Fig. 3b and c).\nThe surface depressions appear to be generated by localized,\nepisodic surface deflation rather than surface erosional\nevents, as isochrones are not cross-cut. The DELORES data\nshow similar, multiple zones of downwarped isochrones\nwith foresets filling the hollows from the southern edge of\nthe profile (Fig. 3a and d). The isochrone pattern suggests\nsurface depressions have been generated and then infilled\non a number of occasions (Fig. 4). Current steady-state\naccumulation is dominated by katabatic winds that blow\neastwards at the study site, approximately parallel to the ice-\nstream flow. The fill structures have instead been deposited\nby storm winds blowing northwestwards, at an oblique\nangle to ice flow (Fig. 1). Form similar features seen in sandy\nbraided river systems (Best and others, 2006) are generated\nfrom flow depositing sands as foresets into previously\nscoured bar-top hollows. This indicates that the infill events\ncan be generated by snow redeposition from storm winds\nunder normal cyclonic patterns.\nSiegert and others (2004a) suggest that distorted internal\nlayers can be produced by at least six processes, including\nchanging basal topography, strain-rate variations, changes in\nsurface accumulation, converging or diverging ice flow,\nchanging basal flow conditions and basal melting. Con-\nsidering these processes, it seems most likely that episodic\nsurface depression in this area of the onset zone could be\ngenerated by:\nA change in flow patterns: The basal topography is\ncomplex, as this margin of the onset zone is above the\nEllsworth Subglacial Highlands. Changes in surface\nelevation or accumulation patterns could result in flow\nswitching around subglacial highs, possibly episodically\naltering flow into the ice stream at this location.\nChange in basal sediments or sedimentary landforms:\nSeismic and radar surveys in the centre of the ice stream\nindicate that basal sediments are important for accel-\nerating flow in the onset region, with dilatant sediments\nbeing deformed into drumlinoid land systems at the ice-\nstream bed (King and others, 2007). Any temporal or\nspatial variations in sediment conditions or sediment\nsupply could result in differential flow and possible\nfolding of internal layers.\nChange in basal melting or water supply: Seismic surveys\nin the ice-stream centre also suggest that water may be\nimportant for generating fast flow in the onset region\n(King and others, 2004). Changes in the volume of water\nsupplied due to reduced (or enhanced) basal melt or\nwater piracy in the complex basal topography around the\nEllsworth Subglacial Highlands could result in reduced\n(or enhanced) flow in a tributary.\nSubglacial lake drainage: The Ellsworth Subglacial\nHighlands are known to contain a series of subglacial\nlakes in topographically controlled, fjord-like environ-\nments (Siegert and others, 2004b; Vaughan and others,\n2007). Drainage mechanisms for these lakes are cur-\nrently poorly constrained, though other lakes in\nAntarctica are now known to drain episodically (Gray\nand others, 2005; Wingham and others, 2006; Fricker\nand others, 2007). Such episodic events would create\ndownwarping in the internal layers and a surface\ntopographic low that could then be infilled.\nThese preliminary and somewhat speculative observations\nindicate that onset zones, particularly those located over\nsubglacial highland regions, can have a high degree of\ninternal instability and complexity. Further data collection\nand modelling are required to assess the stability of the\nregions of onset of fast flow within the complex flow patterns\nof the WAIS.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThis study combines near-surface GPR and deep-look\nDELORES radar data, enabling internal layers to be traced\nfrom the surface to a substantial depth in the onset zone of\nRutford Ice Stream. Modelled particle paths, assuming\nsteady-state velocity and accumulation, reproduce flow-\nparallel particle paths interpreted from the GPR. This\nevidence suggests that the flow regime in the centre of the\nonset region has remained relatively constant for the last\n200 years. However, in the cross-flow lines some local\nvariability in accumulation is seen in areas close to the ice-\nstream margin where episodic fill structures are observed as\nforeset depositional features. This deposition indicates\nepisodic change in a tributary, most likely from changing\nbasal conditions, in order to periodically develop a surface\ndepression that is then infilled. The study indicates the\ndifficulty of assessing stability in onset zones. Further work is\nrequired to assess controls on flow in the tributaries\nconverging from the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands into\nthe onset zone of Rutford Ice Stream.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank L.
