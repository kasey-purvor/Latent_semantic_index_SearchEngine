One example of\\ud\nthis concerns the introduction of the concept of \u201cNanodielectrics\u201d\\ud\nin 2001. It is often demeaned that with new concepts must come\\ud\nnew ways of thinking, opened-minded consideration and unbounded\\ud\nexploration. In this spirit, an activity of high-creative intensity\\ud\nwas organized at Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s research institute (IREQ)\\ud\non October 31st, 2008. A very diversified crowd of international\\ud\nscientists gathered at IREQ to exchange and reflect on the topic. An\\ud\nopportunity to be seized to break the established precincts and, to\\ud\nquestion and imagine the potentialities.\\ud\nProvocative at times, the comments and views were only meant\\ud\nto elicit the progress of our thinking. The present paper does not\\ud\nsummarize the proceedings of the event that came to be known as\\ud\nthe \u201cBrainstorm at the institute\u201d. This paper offers a broad and\\ud\ndiverse view of the topic, with many remaining questions of importance\\ud\nand feeded by recent progress and further reflection. Although\\ud\nlong, the paper gives a vivid picture of the situation allowing\\ud\ncriticism and stressing the many unanswered questions. Multidisciplinary\\ud\nzest is obvious.\\ud\nMost of the participants joined in this new adventure. The list of\\ud\nauthors is given at the end with an indication of their respective\\ud\ncontribution. In view of the great number of authors, no effort was\\ud\nundertaken to reconcile the styles. The end product is a result of a\\ud\nparticipatory effort, and every bit does not need to be guarantied\\ud\nand accepted by all.\\ud\nThe paper benefited particularly from the contributions of some\\ud\nscientists stranger to the usual field, namely A. Vijh, L. Utracki and\\ud\nH. Alamdari. Ashok Vijh joined us with his background in electrochemistry\\ud\nand has enlightened us with analogies of other fields\\ud\nconcepts and applications (Chapter II). Leszek Utracki, a polymer\\ud\nscientist of many talents, has taught us by linking the polymeric\\ud\ncontext of nanocomposites to the dielectric properties. He has produced\\ud\nChapter III. This would have been a logical determining\\ud\ncobblestone just after the introduction of the concept in 2001.

For \nthis paper, he introduced a non-electrotechnical application based \non a nanodielectric material (Chapter VIII, section B). \n \nMichel F. Fr\u00e9chette, Varennes, March 2010 \n  IREQ - 40 ans de savoir et d\u2019\u00e9nergie \n \n \nNanodielectrics; polymer nanocomposites; electrical insulation; \nsolid dielectrics \n \n \nI. NANODIELECTRICS \nWhen the nanodielectric concept was introduced [1] in \n2001, it stemmed from a reaction to the great stir surrounding \nthe nanostructuration of crystalline materials. What was in it \nfor the insulation arena? Was there an equation of the sort \n\u201cNanotechnology + Dielectrics\u201d equals something like a nano-\nmaterial with affected dielectric properties? \nAlready, towards the end of the 90s, we had identified the \naerogel and variants as 3-dimensional nanodielectrics. Also, \nsome works pointed at nanoceramics exhibiting peculiar behav-\niours. Despite the fact that upon sintering, nanometric-size \ngrains grow in dimensions, particular effects if not benefits \nfrom initial mixtures into ceramics of nanocomponents and \nadditives had emerged. The major step taken in 2001 was pro-\nposing special dielectricity for polymer nanocomposites. A \ndielectric behaviour shaped, dictated or affected from a nano-\nscale manipulation. An account of the development of the con-\ncept was published last year [2]. In the emergence of the con-\ncept, the seminal work by John Lewis was recognized. Dielec-\ntricity at the nanoscale is thought to play a major role in deter-\nmining the macroscopic upscale of the phenomena. \n Although so far a major research effort has taken shape on \nnanodielectrics, it was dominated by the influence of polymer \nnanocomposites. In this framework, interfaces (as well ex-\nplained by Lewis [3]) are dominant. However, the concept of \nnanodielectric [4] is more general than this. Eventually, when \nthe degree of self-assembly will be mastered, insulating solids \nof revolution including polymers shall be constructed in which \ninterfaces as well as building blocks will interplay. \nA nanodielectric is by definition \u201ca multi-component di-\nelectric possessing nanostructures, the presence of which lead \nto changes in one of several of its dielectric properties\u201d. The \nnovelty is still in its infancy. Potentiality has been blurred for \ninstances by the quality control of the polymer nanocomposites \nand\/or the effects of sintering involving nanoceramics. But the \nfuture is ahead. Despite the difficulties, partial nanostructura-\ntion of polymer nanocomposites were found to improve partial-\ndischarge resistance, to suppress space charge formation and \naffect charge relaxation, and to prolong the treeing lifetime [5, \n6]. Many times, it remains a mystery how to change many \nproperties at the same time. Especially considering that for an \nelectrotechnical application, the material must satisfy a matrix \nof properties. Many of these properties are not dielectric. \nApart from opening the possibility to tailor dielectric prop-\nerties and improve performance in some instances, some out-\nstanding and novel behaviour were already observed. Giant \npermittivity [7] falls into this category. Although still under \n  \n \nscrutiny, there is evidence for an electrical microstructure con-\nsisting of semiconducting grains and insulating grain bounda-\nries. It would seem that the low-achieved degree of self-\nassembly [8] for now precludes the observation of more novel-\nties. In this direction, progress in the design and use of den-\ndrimers [9] and, for instance, new techniques of sintering at \nlow temperature (see for instance in [10]) will be instrumental \nin the near future. \nFor the next steps of development, force is to mention that \nnanofillers exhibiting extraordinary properties will draw some \nmore attention. It is one of the approaches in order to provoke \nreal emergence of novelty and\/or marked deviations from ex-\ntrapolated property improvement. To mention a few, carbon \nnanotubes [11] with or without encapsulation, silica flakes or \ngraphene planes [12], insulating nanotubes like Boron Nitride \n[13] fall into this category. It is an area of research that shows \npromises. \nThe future lies ahead. The wealth of information on so \nmany aspects presented in the following sections points indeed \nat the existence of a future for the field involving the nanostruc-\nturation of dielectrics. \n \n[1]  M.F.

SOME PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON \nNANOMATERIALS INCLUDING NANODIELECTRICS \nNanotechnology is the new growing frontier involving \nmost areas of science and engineering. Almost every country \nhas some sort of national nanotechnology initiative. \nNanotechnology is the research and development at the \natomic, molecular or macromolecular levels in the sub-100 nm \nrange (\uf07e 0,1 - 100 nm) to create structures, devices and sys-\ntems that have novel functional properties. Other definitions of \nnanotechnology have also been proposed but they all focus \nmore or less on the 0,1 - 100 nm range with some variations \nwhich are not central to the present discussion. \nNanomaterials are thus defined as the substances and con-\nstituents, invariably solids, which are used to make the devices \nand structures in the 0,1-100 nm range. Such nanomaterials \npossessing interesting and useful dielectric properties are \ncalled nanodielectrics, which are the focus of the present re-\nview. These are invariably solid materials and are usually used \nas composites in which a small quantity of nanoparticles of \none material (e.g. an oxide) is embedded within the main body \nof another dielectric material, e.g. a polymer. \nA. Basic Physicochemical Nature of a Nanomaterial and its \nConsequences \nA nanomaterial is dominated by the presence of grain \nboundaries over grains, i.e. over fifty percent of the solid is \nconstituted by line defects (i.e. grain boundaries) and these \ninterphasial regions (between the grains) are constituted by \natoms having bonding (lower coordination number) that leads \nto high surface energy, high reactivity, low stability (e.g. ten-\ndency to sinter under high-field or temperature conditions), \neasy precipitation of impurities, strong chemisorption, and \nhigher ionic conduction, etc. than the grains. \nImportantly, novel functional properties arise in such mate-\nrials owing to their nanosize; such properties usually have \ntheir origins in quantum mechanical effects which exhibit \nthemselves at such levels of miniaturization. Thus \u201cnano\u201d does \nnot just denote \u201cminiaturization\u201d \u2013 such miniaturization must \nlead to novel functions and properties. For example, when a \nnanomaterial particle approaches lower size limit of around 40 \n\u00c5, quantum mechanical effects dominate creating totally new \nmaterial properties, e.g. Pt particles of that size exhibit a \npseudo band-gap and thus reduced electron density and cata-\nlytic properties. Gold particles of that size, on the other hand, \nshow higher catalytic activities for reasons not altogether clear \nat the present time, although it may have to do with the spd \nhybridization under quantized conditions. In semiconductor \nquantum dots and quantum wells, the quantum confinement of \nelectrons and holes arises at the nano-level which gives rise to \nnovel device properties. \nIn \u201cchips\u201d, when integrated circuits are printed with the \ndistances between components and connections approaching \n1-3 nm (10 to 30 \u00c5), there is a \u201ccross-talk\u201d, a sort of quantum \ninterference. This represents the ultimate limit on miniaturiza-\ntion in circuit printing on chips. There are many more exam-\nples, e.g. Josephson junctions in which \u201cnano\u201d thickness of the \noxide layers are involved through which the tunnelling cur-\n  \n \nrents pass; this, of course, is a quantum effect. A more spec-\ntacular example which is extremely speculative, is the basis of \nconsciousness: how a piece of meat (i.e. brain) thinks? At the \nmicrotubules level in the neurons and other brain tissues, there \nare quantum transfer events at the nano and sub-nano scales, \ne.g. work of Roger Penrose [1] at Oxford University and Stu-\nart Hameroff  [2] at the University of Arizona (Tucson) and \nthat of Litt [3]. \nB. Nanomaterials as Nanodielectrics: Problems and Promise \nThe reactive grain boundaries that dominate a nanomate-\nrial including a nanodielectric would be expected to lead to \npronounced heterogeneity of the material with the following \nconsequences (as dielectric materials) : i) high frequency dis-\npersion; ii) high leakage currents; iii) high dielectric loss; iv) \naccelerated \u00ab ageing \u00bb, i.e. deterioration of dielectric proper-\nties with time owing to temperature, field or current induced \nsintering; v) tendency to adsorb impurities and their precipita-\ntion at the reactive sites. \nOn the other hand, high reactivity of these materials would \nherald their use in: sensors; catalysts (gas phase reactions); \nelectrocatalysts as in fuel cells, batteries, photoelectrochemical \ncells, super capacitors; pollution control devices, etc. \nHowever, their use as dielectric materials as such would be \nlimited because of expected high leakage currents and dielec-\ntric losses. \nNotwithstanding these limitations, a great deal of work is \nbeing carried out in formulating composite insulating materi-\nals of commercial interest in which particles of nanodielctrics \nare embedded within a commonly used dielectric material \nsuch as polyethylene. For example, the group of L.S. Schadler \nat RPI in the USA has found that such a procedure yields insu-\nlating materials having improved breakdown strength, both at \nroom temperature and at elevated temperatures. Other workers \nhave also made similar observations [4,5]. What is the origin \nof this improved breakdown strength? \nTo understand the conceptual foundations of such an im-\nprovement, it is important to observe first that the percentage \nof embedded nanoparticles must be quite low (\uf03c1%). This is \nbecause of the low nanoparticle percolation threshold [4], par-\nticularly for the commonly-used particles. If the nanoparticle \ncontent increases beyond the percolation threshold, the \nnanoparticle tends to loose its beneficial effects. This arises \nbecause the nanoparticles act as a sort of hindrance to the \npropagation of electron avalanches found during dielectric \nbreakdown, below the percolation threshold limit; this hin-\ndrance tends to be short-circuited above the threshold limit. \nThat the nanoparticles behave as barriers for electron \npropagation can be looked at from different conceptual angles \nas follows: \n1) Nanoparticles because of their extended surface area \nchange the very nature of the polymer, alter the depth and den-\nsity of trap sites in the language of solid state physics, thus \nreducing charge carrier mobility and energy. \n2) The structure between the polymer and the nanoparticle \nis the key to the trapping mechanism; this is where the charge \nlayer (the \u201cdouble layer\u201d \u2013 see below) develops and nanoparti-\ncles present an elongated scattering path to the charge carriers. \n3) Since the area of interfaces between the nanoparticles \nand the polymer is very large, the whole polymer matrix may \nbe essentially treated as the interfacial region. The outcome is \na set of strengthened nanometric double layer interfaces [5]. \nThese are electrochemical interfaces within which the highest \nfields can be sustained [5]. \nFinally, the most fundamental issue is that nanoparticles \nembedded (distributed) in a dielectric matrix create an enor-\nmous number of nanoscopic electrochemical interfaces and the \ninterphasic regions thus created determine most, if not all, the \nfeatures of nanodielectrics. The most notable feature thus de-\nveloped is the enhancement of dielectric strength (or break-\ndown voltage in engineering jargon). However, one would \nalso expect other concomitant effects such as higher dielectric \nlosses, leakage currents, ageing effects associated with \u201celec-\ntrolytic\u201d migration of charged particles and other effects from \na system in which heterogeneity has been deliberately intro-\nduced and electrochemical double layers have been purpose-\nfully developed. \n \n[1] R.

DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF POLYMERIC \nNANOCOMPOSITES \nThis section describes the components of polymeric nano-\ncomposites (PNC), how these are prepared and what elements \nof their structure impact on dielectric properties. There are \nthree principal PNC ingredients: polymeric matrix, nanoparti-\ncles and intermediary components, labelled as intercalants, \nsurfactants, compatibilizers, etc.  \nA. PNC Components \n1) Polymeric matrix. \nFrom the growing concern for the environment comes a \nneed for polymer recycling, what leads to a progressive re-\nplacement of thermosets by thermoplastics. This tendency first \naffected the classical composites (e.g., epoxy\/glass fiber), then \npolymer blends and now the PNC [1, 2]. Accordingly, this text \nwill emphasize the PNCs based on thermoplastics, especially \non polyolefins (PO) such as the commodity polyethylenes \n(PE) and isotactic polypropylene (PP). These polymers are \nsemi-crystalline with relatively low melting point and may be \nprocessed at temperatures, T \u2264 250oC. PO\u2019s are inexpensive, \nbut degradable by physical (UV irradiation), chemical (oxida-\ntion) and mechanical (chain scission) means. \n  \n \n2) Nanoparticles. \nIn the IUPAC nomenclature, the nano-sized particles must \nhave at least one dimension in the nano-meter range \u2264 2 nm. \nThe nanoparticles may be one-, two-, or three-dimensional, \nbut the industrial interest focuses on one-dimensional thin \nplates with much larger lateral dimensions [3]. These are \nmainly clays with platelets 0.7 \u2013 2.5 nm thick [4]. Recently, \nlayered double hydroxides (LDH) have been introduced [5]. \nThe most frequently used are natural phyllosilicate clays. \nThese are made of one octahedral layer (Oc) sandwiched be-\ntween two tetrahedral (Tc) ones, e.g., montmorillonite (MMT), \nhectorite (HT), or saponite (ST). Neither the chemical compo-\nsition nor the crystalline structure of clay is constant. Con-\ntaminating atoms enter into the layers modifying clay proper-\nties. For example, in MMT substitution of Al+3 in Oc by Mg+2 \nintroduces 0.25 to 1.2 negative charges per unit cell (the cation \nexchange capacity, CEC \u2248 0.5 to 2 meq\/g) and a commensu-\nrate number of exchangeable cations, which are essential for \nthe clay ability to fully disperse (exfoliate). If Al+3 are re-\nplaced by Fe+3 there is no change of electron balance, but the \nclay color changes what in turn results in brownish PNC.  \nIn addition to natural clays, a variety of synthetic and \nsemi-synthetic clays have been used. The prime advantage of \nthese materials is control of purity and stability of their chemi-\ncal composition. They also can be in situ intercalated, avoid-\ning a cumbersome step. The PNC containing synthetic clay are \nwhite and can be dyed to any color and its intensity [4].  \nLittle is known about the size, shape of individual clay \nplatelet, their distribution, variability of chemical composition \nand impurities. Next, a short summary of results obtained by \nthe VAMAS TWA-33 summarizes the present knowledge. \na) Shape, size and size distribution of clay platelets. \nThe three orthogonal dimensions of clay platelet are thick-\nness (t \u2248 1 nm), length (L) = the longest platelet dimension and \nperpendicular to it width (W). For the tested clays the ratio: \nL\/W \u2248 1.5 \u00b1 0.2, thus one may discuss only L. In natural clays \nL follows the Gaussian distribution with mean value \u2248 290 \nnm. For synthetic and semi-synthetic clays this dimension is \nsignificantly larger, viz. 1200 and 870 nm, respectively [6]. \nb) Chemical composition of clays. \nThe chemical composition of clay particles was measured \nusing the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). \nBecause clay may have locally-diverse composition, it is im-\nportant that the measurements are repeated at least 30 times \nper specimens. The statistical error of the chemical composi-\ntion in natural and synthetic clay was found to range from10 to \n5% of the mean value [7]. \nc) Impurities. \nNatural clays are contaminated by organic (humic) sub-\nstances, non-expandable clays (e.g., amorphous clay, vermicu-\nlite, kaolin) and diverse particulate minerals [1]. For the use in \nPNC they are laboriously purified in about 300 steps. How-\never, according to the pertinent patent, the resulting sodium \nclay still contains up to 5 wt% of impurities (amorphous sili-\ncates, stacks of welded platelets and the residual solid particles \nwith diameter > 300 nm) [1, 8]. The commercial, purified clay \nhas 7 wt% of organics, hygroscopic and bound water, carbonic \nacid, etc. \nTwo clays have been analyzed for impurities; the natural \nsodium-MMT (Cloisite\u00ae-Na, or C-Na for short) and semi-\nsynthetic fluoromica (Somasif ME100). In C-Na 13 mineral \ncontaminants were found: Vermiculite, Quartz, Cristobalite, \nRutile, Albite, Microcline, Aragonite, Vaterite, Dolomite, \nGypsum, Anhydrite, Alunite, Sylvite. Production of ME100 \nstarts with natural talc and sodium fluoro silicates. In the semi-\nsynthetic fluoromica small quantities of Vermiculite and Gyp-\nsum were found, probably brought in with talc [9]. \n3) Intercalants and Compatibilizers [1]. \nAfter purification the clay sodium salt is highly hydro-\nphilic and as such it may be exfoliated in water, forming ther-\nmodynamically miscible PNC with such water-soluble poly-\nmers, as polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl \npyridine; unsuitable for dielectric applications. As already \nmentioned, the preferred polymers for such use are hydropho-\nbic PO\u2019s, PE or PP, which are thermodynamically immiscible \nwith clay. The problem may be resolved by converting sodium \nclays into hydrophobic organoclays by reacting it with suitable \nintercalant. When this modification is insufficient for miscibil-\nity, the system may be compatibilized. \nMost commercial intercalants are ammonium salts, \nRi4N+Cl- where Ri are organic groups, some of which should \nbe miscible with the polymer. For PNC with PO-type matrix, \nthe clay may be intercalated with di-methyl di- hydrogenated \ntallow ammonium chloride (2M2HT) such as Cloisite\u00ae 20A \n(C20A). The tallow radicals (from beef fat) are long paraffinic \nand olefinic chains. After hydrogenation, the saturated chains \n(~65% C18, ~30% C16 and ~5% C14) are expected to be misci-\nble with low molecular weight PO.  \nIn addition to making the clay hydrophobic, intercalation \nalso expands the interlayer spacing (from about 1.2 up to ca. 3 \nnm) facilitating inter-diffusion of macromolecular chains, \nwhich results in enhanced platelets dispersion. For maximiza-\ntion of the interlayer spacing, one may use stoichiometric \nquantity of intercalant having large Ri groups. However, since \nthese may block access to polymer molecules, the prefer strat-\negy is the use of excess of intercalant. This strategy also has \nnegative aspects as it increases PNC degradability and con-\nductivity, decreasing modulus. \nSince the PNC ingredients are polydispersed, the polymer-\norganoclay interactions are influenced by many factors. Only \nusing molecular simulation one may determine the effects of a \nsingle factor. Thus, simulation indicates that the ionic charges \nare not located in specific points of clay platelet surface, but \nrather they are delocalized, smeared over large areas. Conse-\nquently, the intercalant is also spread on the surface at thick-\nness dependent on its quality and quantity [10].  \nIncorporation of organoclay into polymer matrix results in \ngood dispersion only in systems with strong polymer\/clay in-\nteractions, such as those observed for polyamides (Nylons). \nHowever, for PNC based on PO, usually compatibilization is \nrequired. This has been accomplished by incorporation of a \ncompatibilizer, prepared by functionalisation of the same type \n  \n \nof PO as that forming the matrix. Molecular simulation shows \nthat efficiency of the process depends on the concentration, \nmolecular weight and \\compatibilizer type [11, 12]. \nB. Preparation of PNC Samples for Dielectric Mea-\nsurements \n1) Compounding. \nThe clay-containing PNC have been prepared by the fol-\nlowing methods (in chronological order): \n\u2022 Reactive (in situ polymerization by polymer manu- \n          facturers) \n\u2022 Solution (dispersing the organoclay in a polymer so- \n           lution) \n\u2022 Melt compounding (by compounders and part- \n          makers). \nMelt compounding is the preferred method that was used \nfor the preparation of PNC samples for dielectric tests.  \nThe three PNC ingredients are listed in Table I. PP has \nbeen used frequently in power capacitors, cable insulation, and \nin layer and phase separators for rotating electrical equipment \nand in transformers [13]. Polybond 3150 (PP-MA), was the \ncompatibilizer. The organoclay C-20A is Wyoming MMT \nintercalated with 2M2HT.  \nThe master batch (MB) method of compounding has been \nselected [14]. Accordingly, PP with 20 wt% PP-MA compati-\nbilizer was dry-blended with Ciba antioxidant, Irganox B-225. \nThe composition was fed from the main hopper to a co-\nrotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) while 10 wt% of organo-\nclay was supplied from a side feeder. The materials were \ncompounded under blanket of dry N2 at T = 200oC, screw \nspeed N = 200 rpm and throughput Q = 5kg\/h. The MB was \npalletized for the use in the subsequent dilution step, which \nreduced the organoclay concentration to 0, 1, 2 and 4 wt%. \nThe weight ratio of the compatibilizer-to-organoclay content \nwas kept constant at 2:1. \n2) Formation. \nThe PNC samples for dielectric test need to have uniform \nthickness of 135 \u00b1 5 \uf06dm and smooth surface. The following \ntwo-step forming method was selected. First, diluted PNC \ncompositions were extruded at T = 180 \u2013 230oC into blown \nfilms. Next, these were flattened in a 3-rolls calender at 115oC. \n \nTable I.

XRD measures d001 \u2013 the interlayer spacing in regu-\nlarly spaced clay stacks. However, it does not \u201csee\u201d the indi-\nvidual clay platelets or those in twisted or deformed stacks. \nFor this reason the additional electron micrographs of different \nmagnification are essential.  \nFor PNC with isotactic PP as the matrix, the interlayer \nspacings is small, d001 = 3.00 \u2013 3.72 nm, decreasing with con-\ncentration. The micrographs show that most clay is in short \nstacks of intercalated platelets, thus the desired random disper-\nsion of exfoliated platelets was not achieved. However, it is \nnoteworthy that PP is highly crystalline polymer in which the \nclay platelets are concentrated in the non-crystalline regions, \nwhere high concentration decreases the interlayer spacing. It \nwas shown that the interlayer spacing linearly decreases with \nincreasing organoclay content (C15) and crystallinity, (X), \nboth in wt%, viz.: \n    d001 (nm) = 10.5 \u2013 0.392 C15 \u2013 0.111 X                       (1) \nAccordingly, the interlayer spacing in amorphous PP ex-\ntrapolated to infinite dilution should be fully exfoliated [15]. \nC. Example of the PNC Dielectric Properties \nVarious electric and dielectric test methods have been used \nin the preliminary studies of the clay effects in the PP-based \nPNC conducted within the VAMAS TWA-33 research pro-\ngram. These included space charge distribution measurements \nusing the Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) method, the short-\nterm electrical aging effects on breakdown strength (EBD) by \napplying a ramp AC or DC voltage of 400-500 V\/s to the \nspecimen placed in silicon oil, DC polarizability and conduc-\ntivity measurements at -10 kV\/mm for detecting the charging \nand discharging currents, dielectric loss at power frequency \nusing several types of ultra precision capacitive bridges for \nwide frequency (0.01 mHz \u2013 20kHz), electroluminescence \nemission (EL), partial discharge resistance measurements, \nelectrical erosion tests, etc. [16-22]. \n1) Space charge vs. clay content and aging time. \nThe total quantity of charge as function of aging time, ta = \n0 \u2013 500 hrs is displayed in Figure 1. \nIn the case of neat PP, the homocharge injected from both \nelectrodes accumulated in the central area, increasing with \naging. In the case of PNC with 2 or 6 wt% organoclay, the \nheterocharges formed in the vicinity of both electrodes, ini-\ntially increasing with aging time and then stabilizing.  \nFor neat PP the undesirable space charge increases with \ntime for at least 500 hrs. Incorporation of 2 wt% organoclay \ndramatically changed this behaviour \u2013 only during the first 24 \nhrs aging the charge increased and then it became constant, at \nthe level significantly lower than that of neat PP. In PNC with \n6 wt% organoclay initially the space charge was about 60% \nsmaller than that in neat PP and 50% smaller that in PNC with  \n  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Charge vs. aging time for PNC containing 0, 2 and 6 wt% organo-\nclay [17, 20]. \n \n2 wt% organoclay. However, after aging for 360 hrs its value \nbecame similar to that in PNC with 2 wt%. Thus, PNC might  \nbe advantageous for the use in high voltage capacitors and \ntransformers, which operate at high electric fields [17, 20]. \n2) Breakdown (BD) tests. \nImmersed in oil film specimens were placed between a \nlarge circular, grounded electrode and a small high voltage \none. For dc tests the positive voltage was increased at a rate of \n90 V\/s, while for ac tests the voltage was increased at a rate of \n70 Vrms\/s until breakdown [16, 18, 21]. Incorporation of clay \nplatelets in PP increased the ac and dc breakdown strength. \nThe effect could be due to the reduction of spherulites size, \ncaused by clay nucleation. Charges could be trapped at the \ninterfaces reducing the probability of breakdown. Taking into \naccount the experimental error, the incorporation of 2 or 4 \nwt% organoclay increased the BD strength by the same \namount. However, while in ac BD increased from 116 for PP \nto 134 (\u00b1 10) kVrms\/mm for PNC\u2019s; in dc the change was more \nsubstantial (from 354 \u00b1 85 to 488 \u00b1 130 kV\/mm). Thus incor-\nporation of nanoparticles increased the breakdown strength by \n15 and 38% in ac and dc field, respectively. \nBulinski et al. studied PP-based PNCs containing 0, 2, 4 \nand 8 wt% of synthetic organoclay [20, 21]. The other ingre-\ndients of these PNCs were the same as listed in Table I and the \nmethod of compounding, forming and testing was as de-\nscribed. The synthetic organoclay was the tetrasilicic \nfluoromica 4CD-Ts from Topy Ind., intercalated with di-\nmethyl di-stearyl ammonium chloride [4]. The synthetic clay \nis more hydrophobic, has platelet with large aspect ratio: \nplatelet width\/thickness p < 6000 and it is free of contami-\nnants.  \n3) Electroluminescence emission (EL). \nEL originates in the space charge injected into the mate-\nrial. PP and PNC comprising 2 and 4 wt% organoclay were \ntested in ac field in steps from 2 to 24 kVrms\/mm, in the pho-\nton-counting mode. These tests were paralleled with the dissi-\npation current measurement (DCM). EL was observed only  \n \n200 220 240 260 280\n0\n200\n500\nBD strength (kV\/mm) \nA\ngi\nng\n ti\nm\ne,\n t a\n (h\n)\nPNC-4\nPNC-2\nPNC-4\nPNC-2\nPP\nPNC-4\nPNC-2\nPP\nPP\n. \nFigure 2. Breakdown strength vs. aging time for PNC with 0, 2 and 4 wt% \nsynthetic organoclay [21]. \n \nabove 12 kVrms\/mm; above this value EL for neat PP increased \nrapidly, whereas for PNC with 2 and 4 wt% organoclay the in-\ncrease was much slower and similar for both compositions. \nThus, addition of organoclay to PP dramatically reduced the \nEL change with voltage, for example, while at 24 kVrms\/mm \nthe EL for PP was 4.8 kp (thousand pulses) for PNC with 2 \nand 4 wt% it was 1.6 kp [20]. \n4) Capacitance and loss measurements. \nIt is to be expected that conductivity vs. clay content will \nshow a percolation threshold near the clay content where ionic \nlayers of dispersed clay platelets or stacks start overlapping.  \nIncorporation of 2 and 4 wt% organoclay increased PP ca-\npacitance (Cp) by 13 and 19%, respectively. Stronger effect \nwas obtained for the loss tangent (tan \u03b4) viz. by a factor of \n10.7 and 22.8, respectively. It is the presence of polar species \n(clay, intercalant, and compatibilizer) that so substantially \nincreases the PNC loss factor. For the same reason, the dc \nconductivity of PNC is higher than that of non-polar PP. How-\never, aging PNC in dc fields increases its dc conductivity far \nless than that of neat PP. \nSch\u00f6nhals determined the dielectric behaviour of PP-based \nPNCs with 0, 2 and 6 wt% of organoclay as a function of tem-\nperature (T) and frequency (\u03bd) [19]. In accord with the previ-\nous observations, the author found that the dielectric loss in-\ncreases with clay content and so does the permittivity at low \nfrequency. The increase of dielectric loss is caused by in-\ncreased conductivity and Maxwell\/Wagner\/Sillars polarization \nchanges with T and \u03bd, due to blocking of charge carriers by \nclay platelets and their double layers. Addition of organoclay \nincreased the dielectric loss factor over broad frequency and \ntemperature ranges. Again, aging the PNC samples did not \nsignificantly change the behavior. Charge trapping at the \nnano-filler particle\/polymer matrix interfaces is the most likely \ncause. \n  \n \n5) Partial discharge erosion tests. \nThe partial ac discharge erosion test was performed for up \nto 6 h at 2 and 5 kVrms, 600 Hz with a tungsten rod electrode \n[22]. The raw data are shown in Figure 3. The difference in \nbehaviour is striking \u2013 while in neat PP the depth linearly in-\ncreases with time (for up to 40 h) in the presence of clay the \nerosion shows a plateau. The level of plateau depends on clay \ncontent. One expects that at the bottom of the eroded well \nthere is a layer of clay blocking further erosion. For lower \nconcentration one needs to degrade more PNC to reach the \nerosion blocking clay concentration, thus the well must be \ndeeper. A similar mechanism has been noted for the thermal \ndegradation of PNC [23].  \nD. Effect of PNC Composition and Preparation on \nProperties \n1) PNC components and composition. \nThere is a large chemical difference between the polymeric \nmatrix and clay platelets. The polymer of interest is a hydro-\nphobic hydrocarbon, thermodynamically immiscible with the \nhydrophilic silicate. The two-step compatibilization creates a \ndiffused ionic layer around the clay platelet, with additional \nion clusters dispersed in the matrix. The interface between \nclay and matrix is further complicated by the physico-sorption \nof organic molecules (e.g., the matrix polymer) and its solidi-\nfication, increasing the effective solid content (this explains \nthe large increase of modulus and barrier properties caused by \naddition of small amount of well-dispersed clay). Clay is an \nefficient nucleating agent that increases the crystallinity. \nHowever, depending on the type and amount of intercalant \nand compatibilizer, these components may shield the clay and \nprevent nucleation. \n0\n20\n40\n60\n0 2 4 6\nPP\nPNC-2\nPNC-6\nEr\nos\nio\nn \nde\npt\nh \n(\uf06dm\n) \nVoltage application time  (h)\nerror bars = \u00b1 3 \uf06dm\n \nFigure 3. AC erosion depth vs. voltage application time for PNC with 0, 2 \nand 6 wt% C15A [22]. \n2) Preparation of PNCs. \nPreparation of PNCs is widespread around the world, in \nlaboratories and in plastics industry. The methods of com-\npounding are known. However, they rarely lead to exfoliation \nin semi-crystalline, hydrophobic matrices such as PP or PE. \nThe specimens used in this study were formed using standard \nprocessing equipments in a general pilot plant. The com-\npounding and forming was carried out without special precau-\ntions usually taken for the production of high purity dielectric \nfilms. However, since such a facility and procedures are \nknown, production of high quality PNC films for dielectric \napplication should not cause problems. \n3) Properties of PNCs. \nThe effects of clay incorporation increase with the degree \nof clay dispersion. For most commercial clays with aspect \nratio of about p = 280, full exfoliation of clay platelets is fea-\nsible only at low concentration, w \u2264 1.14 wt% of inorganic \nclay. Above this limit the crowding of platelets causes them to \nlocally align, forming oriented stacks of decreasing interlayer \nspacing. The high energy clay surface causes solidification of \nthe organic phase up to 6 nm thick. At about 3.6 wt% of clay \nthe stacks with solidified polymer layer around them will oc-\ncupy the full space and additional organoclay will remain non-\ndispersed. Thus, the often cited upper limit of inorganic clay \ncontent of 5 wt% is over-optimistic. Most PNC show the best \nperformance within the concentration range of 2 \u2013 4 wt% or-\nganoclay, i.e., about 1.2 \u2013 2.4 wt% inorganic content. \nDepending on the presence of the contaminating transition \nmetal ions (e.g., Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), clay may catalytically \naccelerate degradation. The Wyoming clay is known to con-\ntain large quantity of Fe+3, which increases the thermal degra-\ndation. However, recent studies showed that metal scavengers \nmay eliminate the catalytic activity of clay and stabilize PNC \n[24]. There is no simple answer regarding the PNC outdoor \nperformance \u2013 there is a large variety of clay compositions as \nwell as that of weathering influences. However, clay has a \nbeneficial influence on UV degradation as this process in-\ncreases clay content in the surface layer, what effectively stops \nthe UV effect. It is noteworthy that clays suppress polymer \nflammability by limiting access of oxygen through formation \nof a crust [23, 25, 26].  \nIncorporation of a small amount of organoclay has large \neffects on the mechanical and barrier properties, but moderate \none on the dielectric behaviour. The brief summary of the \nelectrical and dielectric test results shows the importance of \nthe ionic layer surrounding the nano-particles. By contrast, it \nseems that the intrinsic properties of the clay platelets (e.g., \nchemical composition or aspect ratio) have smaller effect on \nthe dielectric behaviour of PNCs.   \nThe discussed PNC samples have been used in the \nVAMAS- round robin tests (RRT) on the electrical and dielec-\ntric properties. The results indicate that addition of organoclay \nto PP may result in better performance. However, there is \nlarge difference in values reported by different laboratories. \nFor this reason it seems more reasonable to compare the rela-\ntive effect of clay addition determined in a single facility.  \n  \n \nSeveral improvements of dielectric performance have been \nreported, for example that ac breakdown strength (BD) of PP \nincreased after addition of 6 wt% organoclay from 131 to 160 \nkVrms\/mm. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that this modest \npositive effect of nanofiller addition is in sharp contrasts \nwith large negative produced by incorporation of micro-\nfillers. \nClay addition caused virtual arrest of PP aging effects in \nseveral tests. This was evident in the space charge effects \u2013 the \naccumulated charge in PNCs with 2 wt% organoclay started \ndecreasing after 240 h of aging, while that in PP continued to \nincrease with aging time t \u2264 500 hrs reaching the charge value \n2.5 times larger than that in PNC. Similar effect was observed \nin dielectric tests and breakdown strength measurements. \nThe clay effect on the PD erosion is also worth attention. \nSince the effect seems originating in the formation of concen-\ntrated clay layer that stops erosion, even coating the prone to \nerosion part may offer a simple, economic solution. \n \n[1] L.

On imaging and microstructures \n1) Structure and composition. \nOne of the most pressing difficulties in understanding the \nproperties of nanomaterials, such as nanodielectrics, relates to \ndifficulties in obtaining a complete picture of these materials \nstructure and composition at the nanometer level. This is espe-\ncially difficult in nanocomposite materials. In such materials, \nthat contain a large number of nanodispersoids, with dimen-\nsions from a few nanometers to about 100 nanometers, how \ncan we understand the general macroscopic properties of the \nmaterials if we do not have a complete understanding of the \nnanostructures at the nanometer or even atomic level? It is \nsomething to observe or to analyse the general structure, as it \ncan be done through x-ray diffraction for instance; it is quite a \ndifferent task to observe directly the structural variation at the \nnanometer level, as it can be done using high resolution \ntransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). For instance, \nFigs. 1 and 2 show transmission electron micrographs of a \nnanodielectrics material composed of silicon oxide crystals \n(with size varying from \u00b5m to nm) as well as nano clays, \nimbedded in epoxy matrix. One can see in these two micro-\n  \n \ngraphs the large amount of different structures with various \ndimensions down to the nanometer level. \nSuch high resolution observations are critical for under-\nstanding the properties of nanodielectrics. However, in materi-\nals where the structure is designed at the nanometer level, with \nthe addition of nanodispersoids, what are even more critical \nare the properties of grain boundaries. It is well known that as \nwe decrease the average crystalline or structure size in materi-\nals, the amount of atoms that found their place at the surfaces \nof grains increase drastically, especially below 10 nm. For \ninstance, for an average 5-nm grain size, nearly half of the \natoms are present at the surface of crystals [1]. Such large \namount of atoms present at various interfaces results in mate-\nrials having most of their properties determine or partly con-\ntrolled by the properties and composition of these interfaces.  \n \nThis critical influence of grain boundaries and interfaces \nhas a number of important consequences for nanodielectrics: \n\uf0b7\uf020The composition and structure of the grain boundaries \nneed to be known and carefully understood. This means \nthat we need to develop the tools, principally in high reso-\nlution transmission microscopy, to probe these bounda-\nries. Today, for some particular crystalline structure, it is \npossible to identify a single doping atom in a very regular \nstructure [2]; however, direct observation of atoms at \nboundaries or analysis of chemical variation at interfaces, \nis a much more difficult proposition.  \n\uf0b7\uf020The presence of light elements such as hydrogen or \nother gaseous impurities like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon or \nsulfur, that diffuse naturally to grain boundaries, can be \nextremely difficult to observe or control but can have a \nmajor influence on the overall properties of nanomateri-\nals. \n\uf0b7\uf020Even if such impurities do not have a direct impact on  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe property of interest for a particular nanomaterial sys-\ntem, they still can have a crucial impact on other proper-\nties, such as formability or life expectancy. Because of \nthis, the synthesis processes of nanomaterials, such as \nnanodielectrics, need to be extremely well controlled. \n \n \n[1]  U. Erb, K.T. Aust and G.

Many methods \nhave been devised to calculate the crystallinity of XRD. All \nother methods require that the intensity due to the amorphous \nscattering be separated before one begins to evaluate the crys-\ntallinity. In this report we discuss how such parameters in X-\nray diffraction can be obtained by profile fitting a highly crys-\ntalline sample available for that particular nanocomposite, and \nillustrate this idea by using the data from our materials. \nThe profiles of peaks could be described by a modified \nLorentzian. The XRD patterns of HDPE and its nanocompo-\nsites show two distinct (110) and (200) reflection peaks asso-\nciated with the orthorhombic structure of HDPE. The (110) \nand the (200) peaks are observed at 25.35\u00b0 and 28\u00b0, respec-\ntively. The crystalline peaks of polyethylene can be discerned \nfrom the amorphous region by the deconvolution profile fit-\nting. From Fig. 1, some parameters such as full width at half  \nFigure 1.

The FWHM of the polyethylene crystalline peaks, i.e., \nFWHM (110) and FWHM (200), can be employed to describe \nthe crystallization rate of HDPE\/SiO2 nanocomposites. \n \nTable I shows the cristallinity as a function of load content \nobtained from the DSC and XRD measurements. It was found  \nthat as the content of nanocharges increased, the crystallinity \nof the nanocomposites also increased. A possible explanation is \nthat the nanoparticles act as an agent of nucleation for the crys-\ntal growth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. Do chemical effects take over the nano-effects? \nDispersing nanoparticles into polymers lead to enhance-\nment of thermal and mechanical properties of the composite \nwith respect to the conventional material and it is hoped that \nsimilar effects could be observed on electrical performances. \nImprovement of electrical behaviour has indeed been reported \non different types of PNC. Such modifications are attributed, \nbesides to the presence of the filler, to the much higher surface \narea to volume ratio associated with the presence of nano-\nparticles with respect to micrometric-size fillers. We would \nlike to emphasize here that it is most of the time highly chal-\nlenging to relate changes of electrical properties with the \nnanometric size of the dispersion. This is so mainly because \nnano-particles dispersion into polymers involves complex \npreparation steps which can be highly influential on the elec-\ntrical properties. \nThe case of one of the oldest polymer based nano-\ncomposite, layered silicate dispersed in polypropylene matrix, \nwhich has been characterized in details, is a perfect example. \nFirst, starting from isotactic polypropylene, a compatibiliza-\ntion process is needed since the matrix must be rendered polar \nto enhance PP chains entrance into clay galleries. To achieve \nthis, male\u00efc anhydride (a polar species) is grafted on the PP \nchain using peroxide; this first step already involves several \nchemical by-products. The clay is also modified in terms of \ninterlayer distance and organophilic capacity by exchange of \nintergallery sodium cations by protonated octadecylamine, a \nprocess that generates ionic moieties. This complex synthesis \nroute [1] allows controlling the interactions between the host \nmaterial and nanograins. \nWhat is generally observed is that the PNC properties are \ndifferent from those of the polymer alone [2, 3]. However, \ntaking into account the complexity of the PNC, it becomes a \ndifficult task to assign a given property evolution to a nano-\nsize effect. All the involved chemical processes are not neutral \nwhen dealing with optical and electrical properties of the PNC. \nFor example, it has been shown [3] that the optical properties \nin silicate PP based NC are mainly controlled by the compati-\nbilization process of the PP matrix and that the active recom-\nbination centers are those of the matrix. Space charge behav-\niour has been shown to depend more on the matrix (isotactic \nvs. syndiotactic PP) than on the clay concentration. The di-\nelectric losses are increased by the grafting and the clay con-\ncentration and this is linked with the ionic species resulting \nfrom the manufacturing processes [4]. \nIt is well established that dielectric properties and charge \ntransport is highly sensitive to chemical\/physical features of \nthe matrix. Keeping in mind the example of PP based silicate \nNC, compatibilization and silicates dispersion change both the \nmicrostructure of the NC and its chemical nature. Through \nmicrostructure, the distribution of energy levels assisting elec-\ntronic charge transport is changed. Through chemistry, the \ndensity and depth of deep trapping centers giving rise to space \ncharge phenomenon are also altered. The presence of ions \nwould also change the electric and dielectric behaviour. This is \nto say that the attribution of a change in electrical properties to \nincrease of the surface area to volume ratio should be done on \nthe basis of experiments where every step in the preparation of \nthe NCP is under control. This is very demanding from the \npoint of view of material preparation but we believe it is the \nonly way to go forward in the understanding of a specific ef-\nfect of the increased surface area to volume ratio. \n \n[1]  P.

Blurrs of the nano-effect in presence of inorganic oxide \nnanoparticles in a polymers \nThe first successful nanocomposites incorporated nanoscale \nclay into a polymer host material [1]. The subsequent handling \nof these composites is well understood but the dielectric prop-\nerties are difficult to predict, due to the chemistry involved in \nintroducing the clay into the polymer. An alternative to clay are \nnanoscale inorganic oxides, of which there is a wide range to \nchoose from. Examples are Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), alumi-\nnum nitride (AlN), boron nitride (BN), magnesium oxide \n(MgO), silicon dioxide (SiO2) or titanium dioxide (TiO2) to \nname a few. At the zeta potential where their agglomerates \nbecome unstable [2], these particles can be dispersed in a solu-\ntion by means of e.g. ultrasonification and consequently modi-\nfied with silane coupling agents (SCA) in order to keep them \nseparated [3]. The SCA consists of a hydrolyzable and an or-\nganofunctional group, which needs to be chosen according to \nthe used host and filler material. Via the SCA the nanoparticles \nconnect with the polymer host, forming strong bonds. It is \nagreed upon that the interfacial region between particle and \nhost affects the dielectric properties [4, 5]. However, the exact \nnature of this interface region is still unclear. \nInitial results regarding the permittivity of polymer-based \nnanocomposites were astounding since they defied conven-\ntional wisdom. Introducing a small fraction of nanoscale filler \nmaterial into a polymer host reduces the relative permittivity. \nTraditional theories would suggest that a composite of two ma-\nterials would have a relative permittivity with a value between \nthe values of the constituent elements, instead of being lower \nthan either of them. The reason for this unique behaviour \nturned out to be an immobilization of polymer chains surround-\ning the nanoparticles. This effect might very well occur in \ncomposites with conventional filler material, which is in the \nmicrometer range, but was not perceived as a pivotal point for \ndielectrics. Due to the increased importance of the interfaces in \nnanodielectrics, this effect is of great importance. It leads to an \nimportant question: to what extent does the filler material in-\nfluence our composites? The previously often ignored struc-\ntural changes on a molecular level are now of high importance, \nas the aforementioned example illustrates. \nThe main parameters affecting the properties of a nano-\ncomposite can be identified as follows: \n\uf0b7 Filler size, material and aspect ratio \n\uf0b7 Surface functionalization \n\uf0b7 Fillgrade \n\uf0b7 Host material \n\uf0b7 Type of synthesis (in-situ, ex-situ, mixing process, po-\nlymerization, etc.) \nThese parameters consequently are reflected in the quality \nof dispersion of particles within the host material. Until re-\ncently the tendency was to assume that the host material does \nnot change due to the introduction of fillers. Now we think that \nthis is not the case and the presence of a filler material does \nchange the host itself. Polymer chains usually align according \nto intermolecular forces. The chains that bond to a particle sur-\nface via SCA are therefore forced to align according to their \nneighboring molecules. This leads to a restructuring of the host \nmaterial due to the presence of the particle and its ability to \ninteract with the host material. Question is now if the presence \nof the particle and its shape or aspect ratio is more significant \nthan the material the respective particle consists of? \nLooking at dielectric spectroscopy results on nanocompo-\nsites we notice a trend for the permittivity depending on the \nfiller fraction. The real part of the permittivity is decreasing \nwith decreasing nanoscale filler content, until it reaches a \nminimum which usually lies at filler contents lower than 2 % \nby weight or 0.35 % by volume [6, 7]. After this local mini-\nmum the permittivity increases, surpassing the value for the \nbase material eventually. Here the properties of the filler mate-\nrial become more dominant compared to the changes in the \nhost material. Where this point lies seems to be dependent on \nthe particle properties (material, surface modification, size and \nfill grade). It is safe to say that none of the aforementioned in-\nfluences alone leads to the property changes. It is the combina-\ntion of all these factors that lead to the results and it is impor-\ntant for engineers dealing with nanocomposites to be aware. \nThe aspect ratio of the filler material is also of concern. \nSpherical particles lead to different properties than platelets or \nrods. Alignment of the filler within the matrix could also lead \nto differing results. If the filler distribution is random or if it is \naligned to form chains throughout the composite, anisotropic \nbehaviour may be the result. Future applications can exploit \nthis anisotropy in various ways. \n \n[1] A. Okada, Y. Fukushima, M. Kawasumi, S. Inagaki, A. Usuki, S. \nSugiyama, T. Kurauchi, and O.

Glass transition phenomenology \n1) The nature of the glass transition. \nThe glass transition constitutes an important phenomenon \nfor many classes of materials, in that it is frequently associated \nwith a marked change in physical properties. In the case of \n  \n \namorphous linear polymers, for example, the glass transition \ncorresponds to a change in modulus of several orders of mag-\nnitude, from a brittle solid well below the so-called glass tran-\nsition temperature (Tg) to a viscoelastic solid or viscous liquid \nat higher temperatures. However, if mechanical properties are \nmeasured under an oscillatory strain, then the resultant marked \ndecrease in modulus described above is seen to occur at a tem-\nperature that is dependent upon frequency; a lightly cross-\nlinked rubber may appear elastomeric at 1 Hz but behave as a \nglassy solid at ultrasonic frequencies. If isochronal measure-\nments of sample volume are made at constant pressure, the \nglass transition manifests itself as a change in the gradient of a \nplot of specific volume against temperature. The temperature \nat which this occurs is, however, dependent upon the length of \ntime at which the specimen is held at each temperature prior to \nmeasuring its volume; the longer the time, the lower the ap-\nparent Tg.   \nThe physical state of a glass is dependent upon many fac-\ntors, but it is rarely if ever, in thermodynamic equilibrium.  \nFor example, if a polymer is quenched from a temperature T1 \nto another temperature T2, where T1 > Tg > T2, then the initial \nglassy state will depend upon both T1 and T2; thereafter, it will \ntend to relax towards thermodynamic equilibrium, a process \ntermed physical ageing. The origin of such effects is well il-\nlustrated by the Gibbs-DiMarzio theory, which builds on \nFlory\u2019s earlier work on polymer solutions. Put simply, this \nenvisages a polymer molecule as an array of contiguous cells \nwithin a lattice; adding more polymer molecules to the lattice \nincreases the number of occupied cells and reduces the number \nand sizes of the \u201choles\u201d between the polymer molecules (that \nis, the number of unoccupied lattice sites or the free volume of \nthe system decreases). While the above has been stated in \nterms of adding more molecules to the lattice, equivalent proc-\nesses occur when a polymer is cooled. At some temperature, \nthe distribution of free volume in the system is such that mo-\nlecular motion is no longer possible within the time scale of \nthe measurement; free volume is envisaged as being dynami-\ncally created and destroyed locally through the cooperative \nmotion of chain segments. Although theory predicts a finite \nnon-zero temperature at which the configurational entropy \nbecomes zero, which would correspond to the thermodynamic \nTg, practically, the concept of Tg is best viewed in terms of free \nvolume and molecular mobility. As such, it is dependent upon \nmolar mass, crosslinking, additives, interfaces, etc. For further \ndetails on the nature of the glass transition, reference to the \nexcellent overview of McKenna [1] is recommended. \n2) The glass transition in nanocomposites. \nA key feature in the topic of nanocomposites concerns the \nrole of interfaces and, as such, this area has received consider-\nable attention.  In his 2004 paper, Lewis [2] considers the frac-\ntion of material adjacent to an interface within a nanocompo-\nsite and points out that, in the case of an interphase region of \nthickness 10 nm, this component will dominate for particles \nless than about 100 nm in diameter. Numerous studies of \nnanocomposite interfaces have therefore been undertaken. For \nexample, the application of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy \nto PMMA\/kaolinite [3] revealed an increase of 0.6 eV in the \nenergy of the oxygen 1s orbital, which was ascribed to hydro-\ngen bonding between the carbonyl groups of the polymer and \nhydroxyl group in the kaolinite sheets. Electron spin resonance \nstudies of poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and synthetic fluoro-\nmica demonstrated that, in exfoliated systems, the local mobil-\nity of PMA chains is reduced due to the interactions with the \nnanofiller. The thickness of the rigid interface region was es-\ntimated to be in the range 5-15 nm [4].   \nInteractions such as those described above can have a \nmarked influence on material confined near an interface and \nthis is well illustrated by considering the case of ultrathin \npolymer films, where both the film thickness and specific in-\nteractions with any substrate can affect the glass transition.  \nMost results indicate that thickness effects begin to manifest \nthemselves in the range 50\u201380 nm [5]; in the case of free \nstanding ultrathin films of polystyrene, a large and molar mass \ndependent decreases in Tg has been observed [6]. In contrast, \nin the case of poly(methyl methacrylate), much smaller effects \nhave been reported [7] while, for poly(vinyl acetate), no \nchange was seen [8]; in extremely thin films, the disappear-\nance of a glass transition has been reported [9]. Such effects \nare generally attributed to reduced restrictions on molecular \nmobility with decreasing thickness. Where the film is sup-\nported upon a substrate smaller decreases and even increases \nin Tg have been reported [9, 10]. Evidently, both geometric \nand interaction effects are important. \nAnother area that has attracted considerable attention con-\ncerns the behaviour of confinement within pores. In the case \nof the small molecular system ortho-terphenyl (o-TP), a de-\ncrease in Tg has been reported with decreasing pore size [11] \nas a result of the material in the nanopores being constrained \nand vitrifying under conditions of constant volume (isochoric \nconditions); modelling of such systems [12] indicates that this \nis an intrinsic size effect related to the influence of a negative \nhydrostatic pressure on glass formation. Replacing the o-TP \nwith a solution of polystyrene in the same solvent has been \nshown to result in a more complex form of behaviour involv-\ning two glass transitions [13], one below and one above the Tg \nmeasured for the equivalent bulk system. The lower of these, \nwhich decreases with decreasing pore size, relates to the phe-\nnomenon described above, while the higher is associated with \nmolecular interactions at the pore surface. A more complex \nthree layer model has also been proposed, based upon dielec-\ntric studies of the dynamic properties of low molar mass hy-\ndrogen-bonded organic small molecules within porous sol\u2013gel \nglasses [14]. Dielectric studies of propylene glycol and two \npoly(propylene glycol)s (PPGs) of different molecular weight \nconfined in controlled pore glasses [15] have revealed a retar-\ndation and broadening of the \u03b1 relaxation process associated \nwith Tg, and the existence of an additional relaxation attributed \nto the interaction of a few layers (hydrogen bonding effect) of \nthe confined liquid with the surface of the pore. Elsewhere, Tg \nhas been found to vary in a non-monotonic manner [16], \nwhere Tg first decreases and then increases as the pore size is \nreduced, depending upon which of the above effects (intrinsic \nsize or interfacial interactions) dominates. Petychakis et al \n[17] studied the dielectric properties of fractions of polyiso-\nprene with molar masses spanning the entanglement molar \nmass within a porous glass. The results indicate that the mo-\nlecular dynamics are strongly dependent upon the molecular \nlength, weight, pore size and pore surface treatment. Such ex-\nperimental observations are supported by theory and simula-\ntion [18, 19]. \n  \n \nIn the case of nanocomposites, effects similar to those de-\nscribed are seen. However, since the systems are generally less \nwell defined, quantitative analysis is more problematical. As \npart of a study of hydrogen bonding in nanocomposites com-\nposed of poly(acrylonitrile-co-methylacrylate) and the rod-like \nnanoclay attapulgite, Yin et al [20] examined the effect of \ncomposition on Tg. Although an apparent increase (~ 4 oC) in \nTg. as inferred from the mechanical loss, was seen in the sys-\ntem containing 1% of the nanofiller, examination of the raw \ndata indicates that no systematic trend exists as the nanofiller \ncomposition increases, suggesting that interfacial effects are \nminimal. Negligible changes in Tg with composition have also \nbeen reported for poly(L-lactide)\/polyhedral oligomeric silses-\nquioxanes nanocomposites [21] and a thermoplastic polyure-\nthane\/nanoclay system [22]. In another study of PU-based \nsystems [23], a range of complementary techniques were used \nto study the glass transition in nanocomposites based upon \nmontmorillonite (MMT). Agreement between the various \ntechniques was found to be good and suggested that similar \nmolecular dynamics occur in both the pure matrix and the \nnanocomposites. However, evidence also exists for a fraction \nof the polymer in each nanocomposite that makes no contribu-\ntion to the glass transition. Evidence for an immobilized inter-\nfacial phase that did not affect Tg has also been seen in poly-\namide\/layered silicates systems [24]. Conversely, a study of \nthe mechanical relaxation behaviour of poly(vinyl alco-\nhol)(PVA)\/silica nanocomposites revealed two relaxations, \nwhich the authors attributed to the glass transition of the PVA \nmatrix (43 oC) and segments for PVA chains confined by the \nsurface of silica nanoparticles (83 oC). This study went on to \ndeduce that the thickness of the interfacial immobilized was 5-\n10 nm and dependent upon composition [25]. In the case of \npolyimide\/ReO2 nanocomposites, addition of the nanoparticles \nresulted in a pronounced reduction (~10 oC) in Tg [26]; similar \neffects are discussed by Crosby and Lee [27] in their review \non the mechanical behaviour of nanocomposites in connection \nwith molecular confinement. The effect of adding silica \nnanoparticles of different sizes to an epoxy resin was reported \nby Ou and Shiu [28]. This work revealed a pronounced in-\ncrease in Tg (up to 20 oC) on adding as little as 0.3% of the \nnanoparticles; the smaller the nanoparticles, the greater the \nelevation in Tg. Similar pronounced increases in Tg have been \nreported elsewhere for both silica and titania-based nanocom-\nposites [29]. However, Singha and Thomas [30] report that the \naddition of even small concentrations of spherical nanoparti-\ncles, (titania, alumina and ZnO), has entirely the contrary re-\nsult. In this study, a decrease in Tg of some 8 oC was reported \non adding just 0.5% of nanofiller. Work on epoxy\/carbon \nnanotube systems presents evidence that such effects are not \nonly related to physical effects (surface interactions and con-\nfinement) but can also be a consequence of changes in the \nchemistry of the system. Miyagawa et al [31] investigated the \nmechanical relaxation behaviour of epoxy\/functionalised sin-\ngle-wall carbon nanotube (FSMCNT) nanocomposites and \nreport that the addition of 0.20 wt% nanofiller resulted in a \ndecrease in Tg of ~30 oC. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) \nof these systems revealed a reduction in the onset of thermal \ndecomposition, an observation interpreted in terms of reduced \ncrosslinking of the matrix, despite the fact that the stoichiome-\ntry was unchanged from that used in ideally cured neat epoxy.  \nFurthermore, modification of the anhydride content was sub-\nsequently used to redress this effect. In short, incorporation of \nnanofiller can affect the cure reaction, necessitating a recon-\nsideration of the optimum matrix composition. Elsewhere \n[32], the addition of a functionalised MMT to an epoxy resin \nwas shown to accelerate the curing reaction; in this case the \nobserved decrease in Tg was ascribed to alkylammonium \ncations from the clay acting as a plasticizer. \nTo conclude, both geometrical and interaction effects can \ninfluence free volume and molecular mobility and, conse-\nquently, Tg. In the case of thin films and nanoporous systems, \nthe effects seen experimentally have been subject to consider-\nable theoretical analysis and are reasonably well understood.  \nIn the case of nanocomposites, equivalent processes should \noperate. However, even in nominally equivalent systems, con-\ntradictory trends have been reported suggesting that either \nsubtle unidentified effects are dominating or, more likely, that \nissues associated with the reproducible sample preparation and \ndetailed characterisation need to be addressed.  \n \n[1]   G.B.McKenna, Comprehensive Polymer Science, Vol. 2, eds.

Dielectric response \nThe dielectric response of loaded insulating materials, \nwether by conductive or non-conductive particles, has been \nstudied since decades for micrometric loading [1, 2] and more \nrecently for nanosize fillers in either polyethylene, polypropyl-\nene or epoxy matrix [see 3-5 for example]. Before tackling the \nparticular case of nanofillers, it might be appropriate to summa-\nrize what is generally found for classic micrometric compos-\nites. Most of the dielectric data provided in the literature for \nnon-conductive fillers, such as metallic oxides, in a non-\nconductive polymeric matrix, will feature, in addition to the \nrelaxation mechanisms proper to each phase, an interfacial po-\nlarization peak, known as Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polariza-\ntion, and an increase of both the real and in imaginary parts of \nthe complex permittivity as the frequency is lowered. Figure 1 \nshows a typical result for SiC loaded epoxy. The increase of \nboth real and imaginary part of the complex permittivity is re-\nlated to non-ohmic charge transport, leading to various forms \nof electrode polarization or the so-called low frequency disper-\nsion [2, 6]  \nAnother universal observation for ordinary composites is \nthat none of the existing mixing laws [1, 2] can fit the experi-\nmental data on a broad range of frequencies [7, 8].  Indeed, \nnone of the numerous existing models can even come close to \nfit the data depicted in Figure 1.

Real (a) and imaginary (b) part of the complex permittivity of ep-\noxy\/SiCp \u2013 50 \uf06dm composite as function of frequency (from [7]). \n  \n \nexistence of absorbed water in materials and particularly in the  \ninterfacial region between the filler and the polymer matrix is \nalmost inevitable and will invariably affect the composite di-\nelectric response, often leading to a interfacial relaxation peak \nat much higher frequency than what would be expected based \non values of the filler bulk conductivity. This effect is ex-\npected to be even more pronounced for nanocomposites as the \nvolume fraction of interfaces is much higher. Specific findings \nrelated to the dielectric response of nanocomposites are the \nsuppression of the interfacial relaxation peak that is sometimes \nobserved and the decreased of permittivity for low filler con-\ncentration [4]. A similar effect to this observation can be \nfound in very common materials such as salty water for which \nthe static permittivity reduces as a function of salinity for low \nsalt concentration because all the water molecules that are in \nthe vicinity of an ion orient themselves with respect to the ion \n[9]. \nFigure 2 shows the dielectric response of a 5% wt. \nnanosilica filled HDPE. Details about sample preparation and \nprocessing are given elsewhere [10]. In order to fit the data \nwith the Maxwell-Wagner equation (particular case of the \nMWS equation for spherical particles, see equation 13.5 of [2]), \none must use unrealistically high values of conductivity for \nsilica. This fitting is shown in Figure 2 using \n\uf077\uf065\n\uf073\uf065\uf065\no\nff i\uf02d\uf03d*    (1) \nand the experimental data for the neat HDPE for \uf065m* (for \nHDPE, \uf065\u2019\u2019 is very low and \uf065\u2019 is almost constant for the whole \nfrequency range). To take into account the possible presence of \na water interlayer between the nanofiller and the matrix, a three \nphase model known as the interlayer model [11] can be use. \nThis would justify the position of the relaxation peak shown in \nFigure 2 but not its shape since this model also leads to a De-\nbye-type relaxation process. A possible explanation for the \nshape of the relaxation peak is a distribution of the interlayer \nconductivity. This would be in good agreement with the micro-\nscopic examinations of the composite shown in Figure 2 that \nrevealed a somewhat broad distribution of the inclusion sizes \n[10]. This suggests that dielectric spectroscopy is a good tool to \nassess the quality of the particle distribution. \n10\n-1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n3\n10\n4\n10\n5\n10\n610\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\nFrequency (Hz)\nIm\nag\nin\nar\ny \npe\nrm\nitt\niv\nity\n \n \nMWS - conductivity = 0.03 uS\/m\nHDPE + 5% wt nanosilica\n \nFig. 2: Imaginary part of the complex permittivity of HDPE loaded with 5% wt. \n(volume fraction = 0.02) of nano silica compared with the MWS model for \nspherical particles with a conductivity of 0.03 \uf06dS\/m. \n \n[1] L.K.H. van Beek, Dielectric Behavior of Heterogeneous Systems, in \nProgress in Dielectrics, J.B.

Space charge and ageing involving nanocomposites \n1) Space charge formation. \nDoes the addition of nanoparticles in an insulating matrix \naffect significantly the space charge accumulation ? To try to \ngive some answers to this question, we have analysed a micro-\ncomposite epoxy (micrometric silica dispersed in an epoxy \nmatrix at a loading of 60% by weight) and the same material \nwith nanofiller (adjunction of a small amount of nanoclays \n0,45% of the total weight). The space charge accumulation has \nbeen obtained by using the Thermal Step Method (TSM) with \nvariation of electrical and thermal ageing duration times (up to \n1611 hours under 15 kV\/mm at 60\u00b0C) \uf05b1\uf05d). The TSM is a non-\ndestructive technique allowing to follow up the evolution of \nthe space charge accumulation in time. \nFigure 1 exhibits several significant results: \n- The nanofilled sample seems to accumulate less \nspace charges throughout the ageing; \n- After 400 hours, the space charge accumulation \nseems to decrease in the nanofilled; \n- The sample without nanofiller presents stronger oscil-\nlations on the total trapped charge; \n \nThe last point could be explained by considering that the sam-\nple must reach a significant level of local electric field before \ndischarging.

In particular, longer life in \nservice can be expected by increasing electric strength and \nendurance. Nanofiller type, size and density have to be tuned \nproperly on the basis of the specific properties which have to \nbe improved [1, 2]. Moreover, these properties are correlated \nto the application in which such materials will be used. For \ninstance, under ac supply resistance to partial discharge (PD) \nactivity is an important property which can increase remarka-\nbly material life in service [3, 4]. Under dc conditions, on the \ncontrary, PD resistance has not the same importance as space \ncharge accumulation, which is known to have to be reduced in \norder to guarantee long insulation life [5, 6].  \nFor this purpose, the following experiments were performed \non flat specimens with and without nanofiller: \n1) Ac life tests under PD activity in needle-plane cell at 10 \nkV (5 times the PD inception voltage). Tests were per-\nformed at 250 Hz in order to reduce test times. Speci-\nmens of base epoxy resin (N0) and containing 5%wt \n(N5), 10%wt (N10) and 25%wt (N25) of silica nano-\nfiller were aged until breakdown. Surface erosion was \nalso measured at fixed time intervals [4]. \n2) Space charge measurements were performed at differ-\nent fields on base polypropylene (PP) specimens and \nwith 5% layered silicates (LS). A polarization phase of  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10000s was followed by depolarization which lasted \n3600s. The maximum stored charge density at the be-\nginning of depolarization is measured [6]. Ac and dc \nelectric strength tests were also performed on these \nspecimens. \n \n  Failure times, namely the scale parameter \uf061 (63.2th-\npercentile) of the Weibull distribution, obtained from ac aging \ntests under PD activity performed on each material are re-\nported in Table I, together with the relevant confidence inter-\nvals at 90% probability. As expected, nanostructured materials \nwithstand better PD erosion with respect to the base epoxy. \nMoreover, increasing filler content life performance improves \nlargely. Failure time for N25 is, in fact, almost one order of \nmagnitude larger than for N0 and N5. This is confirmed also \nby erosion area measurements reported in Fig. 1. Material N25 \nshows, in fact, a much slower increase of surface degradation \nwith respect to the other materials. Under dc conditions space \ncharge accumulation is shown to be significantly reduced by \nthe nanofiller presence. Figure 2 reports the max absolute \nstored charge density, qmax, accumulated in the material as a \nfunction of poling field. It can be observed that, although the \nthreshold field for space charge accumulation is reduced for \nthe nanofilled materials with respect to the base material, i.e. \nfrom 14 kV\/mm to 5 kV\/mm, the former accumulates less  \ncharge than the latter at fields larger than 30 kV\/mm.

On the erosion performance  \nThough during recent years numerous original publications \nand review papers have been devoted to nanodielectrics, infor-\nmation concerning their resistance to erosion caused by differ-\nent types of electric surface discharges is still scarce. Among \nthe types of the surface discharges evaluated, corona, partial \ndischarges, gliding discharges and arcing dominate. All these \ndischarge types have detrimental impact on material perform-\nance and it has been of vital importance to investigate how \nmuch the use of nano-fillers may improve the performance and \nreliability of insulation systems.  \nWhen tracing a few years back, Lei and Xishan [1] reported \nfirst on the resistance to tracking and erosion of room tempera-\nture vulcanized silicone rubber (RTV) coatings filled with \nnano-silica and nano-layered silicate. The authors concluded \nthat flame suppression mechanisms of the nano-filled compos-\nites were absolutely different from that of ATH filled RTV and \nthe sphere and layered shaped nano-filler particles could take \nover the role of flame retardant. Later on, Lei et al [2] extended \nthe work to investigations of the materials to corona discharges \nand proved that nano-filled RTV performed better than tradi-\ntional RTV. It was also shown that nano-layered silicate filler \ncould be dispersed in the SIR matrix uniformly and with only 5 \nwt% concentration contributed to improved tracking resistance \nand mechanical properties [3]. \nEl-Hag et al [4] demonstrated that performance of silicone \nrubber (SIR) filled with 10 wt% of fumed nano-silica was simi-\nlar to that of 50 wt% micro-filled one. The authors also applied \nlaser ablation technique to evaluate the erosion performance of \nthe samples [5] and postulated that formation of silica like layer \nhelped to impede the degradation of SIR in the nano-filled ma-\nterial, which resulted from the strong bonding between nano-\nfiller particles with the rubber matrix. Despite of the differ-\nences in erosion resistance, the investigations revealed that \nboth nano- and micro-silica filled SIR retained similar thermal \nconductivity. The nano-silica filled RTV was also suggested to \nbe better suitable for use in contaminated environments since it \nhad a higher erosion resistance [6]. \nIn parallel, R\u00e4tzke and Kindersberger 0 evaluated the ef-\nfects of silica and alumina nano-fillers on the resistance to arc-\ning of silicone SIR elastomers. The authors demonstrated a \nlonger test time withstand with increased filler concentration \nand pointed to the importance of a good filler dispersion. The \nnecessary good dispersion could only be achieved in case of \nnano-silica, while alumina nano-filler agglomerated and rather \nacted as ordinary micro-filler. However, the enhanced resis-\ntance to arcing became only evident with relatively high con-\ncentration (~40 wt%) of the silica nano-filler.

Further investigations were done using a sili- \ncone rubber with a precipitated (silica 1) and a fumed (silica 2) \nsilica nano-filler [8-9]. Both filler types were untreated and \nhydrophilic. The results showed a highly improved resistance \nto high voltage arcing and resistance to tracking and erosion \n(Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable.) already at low filler \ncontents (< 5 wt%) of the precipitated silica compared to the \nsilicone rubber without fillers. \nFor the materials with fumed silica no significant improve-\nment was observed. The different behaviour was explained by \nthe estimated interphase content, which seems to be high for \nstrong interactions between filler and matrix material and small \nfor weaker interactions. This assumption was supported by \nTGA measurements [9]. Also Venkatesulu and Thomas [10] \nshowed that the performance of a composite filled with 4 wt% \nnano-particles was comparable to that filled with 30 wt% mi-\ncroparticles. \nInvestigations on possible improvements in nano-filler dis-\npersion and its effect on tracking resistance were recently per-\nformed by Ramirez et al [11-13], who modified nano-filler \nparticles with surfactants and showed that one of them, e.g. \nTritonTM X-100, appeared especially suitable for improving \nthe dispersal and therefore resistance to arcing and to heat ero-\nsion in silica and alumina based SIR compositions.  \nEpoxy based materials with surfaces structured with nano-\nparticles and characterized by superhydrophobic properties \n(contact angle \u2265 130\u00b0) were recently evaluated by Wu and \nSchnettler [14] for their performance in modified rotating \nwheel dip test, clean fog test and condensation test. While the \nperformance became enhanced under rain or fog conditions, a \ndecline in the resistance to form continuous moisture layer was \nobserved under dew condition. Also bulk filled epoxy compos-\nites, containing nano- and micro silica fillers, were also re-\ncently evaluated within CIGRE WG D1.24. Changes imposed \nby corona and ozone treatment on electrical properties (surface \nand volume charging currents and dielectric response) were \ninvestigated by Bin et al [15], who found that the contents of \nthe micro- and nano-fillers played a significant role in the ob-\nserved surface changes. Long-term corona-ozone exposure had \nobvious effect on the surface properties. On the other hand, the \neffects of the treatment on the volume properties, dielectric \npermittivity and dissipation factor (dielectric losses) did not \nexhibit high sensitivity.  \nThe above described investigations had revealed that use of \nnano-composites may yield satisfying performance under the \naction of surface electrical discharges. For practical applica-\ntions, the main challenging questions to be answered in the \nfuture concern the possibility of manufacturing large volumes \nof well dispersed nano-filled materials. At the same time, as the \nerosion and tracking in electric power applications refer mainly \nto material surfaces, possibilities to reproduce self-organizing \nnanostructures that can provide special properties on large sur-\nfaces of polymeric materials should be in focus. \n \n[1] L.

THE INTERFACE AND ITS ROLE IN VIEW OF HIGH-\nDEGREE SELF-ASSEMBLY NANODIELECTRICS \nA. The interface. \nA recent review of the chemistry and physics of the inter-\nface of nanodielectrics made using either spherical inorganic \nnanoparticles or intercalated and exfoliated layered inorganic \nnatural and synthetic clays and micas, by Reed [1], highlights \nthe progress in understanding the role of the interface, but also \ncites many instances of apparent contradictory results by dif-\nferent investigators, in properties where the measurements are \ntypically repeatable, unlike electrical breakdown. This obtains \nfor samples freshly prepared, and does not include any electri-\ncal, mechanical, physical or thermal aging effects.   \nThe fact that there are these differences is not a problem \nbut it emphasizes that there is a lot of interface chemistry in-\nvolved in making nanocomposites, requiring careful control of \neach synthesis step; and helps to explain why significantly \ndifferent performance may result, ranging from indifferent \nperformance relative to the base polymer, to significant im-\nprovements in performance in such properties as long term \nvoltage endurance and PD resistance.    \nMeasurements on polymer nanodielectrics of glass transi-\ntion temperature, free volume, broadband (10 -2 Hz to 1 GHz) \ndielectric measurements of the real and imaginary components \nof permittivity, morphology and infrared and electron para-\nmagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, illustrate the varia-\ntions that researchers have found [1], and the difficulty of \nmodeling the interface at this point in time. The glass transi-\ntion temperature (Tg) provides a good example of this, and of \nthe need to continue confirming results with considerable care \nin the synthesis, purification, and preparation of samples for \ntesting; and the characterization thereof.   \nAlcoutlabi and McKenna [2] performed a topical review of \n406 theoretical and experimental publications on the effect of \nnanoparticles on melting point and glass transition tempera-\nture. They presented dynamic, thermodynamic, and pseudo-\nthermodynamic measurements reported for Tg in confined \ngeometries for both small molecules in nanopores and for ul-\ntrathin films. They found that Tg increases, decreases, remains \nunchanged, or even disappears, depending on details of the \nexperimental conditions or molecular simulation. For the same \nmaterial, depending on experimental conditions, different val-\nues of Tg had been observed; it was also noted that the vast \nmajority of the experiments had been carried out carefully and \nthe results were reproducible. The authors conclude that exist-\ning theories of Tg are unable to explain the range of behav-\niours at the nanometric size scale.  \nOn the other hand, Bendler and colleagues [3] have a more \npositive view, and present a quantitative analysis that shows \nthat most if not all, experimental results on the nanoconfine-\nment of the glass transition temperature can be explained by a \ndefect diffusion model. Their model incorporates defect-defect \ninteraction enthalpy, defect concentrations, defect lattice ge-\nometry correlation length, and percolation fraction, to deter-\nmine Tg; and provides  a quantitative relationship between the \npercolation fraction of rigid to mobile regions and Tg.. \nWork by Singha and Thomas [4,5] for different spherical \ninorganic nanoparticles in bisphenol-A epoxy, as a function of \nfiller concentration, illustrates a strong, unusual sensitivity of \nTg to concentration. Tg drops sharply as the concentrations \nincreases to 0.5%, then steadily increases as the concentration \nwas increased to 20%. The ability to understand and physi-\ncally describe this behaviour will be important in improving \nour understanding of the nano interface and developing a \nmodel that can be related to other physical and as-yet-\nunexplained electrical properties.    \nThe electrical structure of the interface has been repre-\nsented by Lewis [6] as a Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer \nand by Tanaka and colleagues [7] as a 4-layer structure, before \nthe matrix polymer properties are resumed. However, while \nthese models may apply in some cases, their verification has \nnot been confirmed, and in many cases, some of which feature \ndramatic improvements in properties, the evidence points to a \nsimple non-polar, low conductivity bonding of nanoparticles \nto the  surrounding polymer matrix. \nHowever, as covered in reference 1, there are also some \ndifferences in interface characteristics which can be related to \nthe chemical nature of the nanoparticle surface and to the type \nof polymer matrix (e.g. amorphous or semi-crystalline ther-\nmoplastic polymer, cross-linked polymer, thermoset polymer), \nand to molecular weight and stereo-regularity qualities.    \nThe influence of water on properties such as broadband di-\nelectric or infrared measurements, or low- or high-field elec-\ntrical measurements, or short- and long-term hydrolysis at the \nnanoparticle surface and other aging effects, cannot be over \nemphasized; whether from residual water on nominally \n\u201cdried\u201d particle surfaces, or water that diffuses into a sample \nafter preparation, or from water\/other solvents used in making \nintercalated\/exfoliated polymer nanocomposites. The range of \nsuch potentially dominant effects due to water is covered in \ntwo recent reviews by Reed [1] and, dealing primarily with the \nimpact of water during the processing of intercalated and exfo-\nliated nanocomposites and the subsequent undesirable effect \nupon properties, by Bellucci and colleagues [8].   \nIn summary, our understanding and control of the interface \nis still largely incomplete, and controlled experiments, includ-\ning the use of tagging agents such as those used by Jeschke [9] \nin EPR experiments, will help toward improving our under-\nstanding.    \nB. Self-assembly. \nIn contrast with a significant volume of work on nanodi-\nelectrics over the past decade and the focused interest in the \nrole of the interface, the insulation and dielectrics literature \nhas shown little evidence that self-assembly has been widely \naddressed for dielectric polymer nanocomposites.  \n  A summary of the status of self-assembly in dielectric \nnanocomposites by Reed in 2007 [10] contrasted the prospects \nwith spherical inorganic nano particles, where partial self-\nassembly has been successfully used, and with intercalated \nand exfoliated nanocomposites from layered clays and micas. \nIn the latter, multiple processing steps are employed, and self-\nassembly generally would appear to be ignored, or for proprie-\n  \n \ntary reasons has not been disclosed. Never-the-less, clearly, \nsome of the processing steps are amenable to self-assembly \nand may likely be desirable in order to achieve improved con-\nsistency of the final product and faster overall processing.  \nAn interesting paper which addresses the problem of \nachieving self-assembly in a 3-D material is that of Sandhage \nand colleagues [11].  \nOverall, there has been little published progress with the \nself-assembly of polymer nanocomposites for dielectric and hv \ninsulation over the past few years; and nothing where details \nhave been spelled out.          \n \n[1] C.W.

At the same time concerns about adverse effects of \nthe nanoparticles on human health have emerged [1,2]. These \nconcerns have originated from long-term studies of very-fine \nair-borne industrial pollution and from the use of asbestos in \nindustrial products [3-7]. The present text provides basic in-\nformation on possible effects of nanoparticles on human \nhealth, safe working practices in laboratories and at industrial \nworking places, and risk assessment of nanoparticles so that \ninformed decisions about future production lines, the use and \nrecycling of nanomaterials can be made. It should be noted \nthat nanotoxicology is a new field and detailed mechanisms of \nnanoparticle effects on environment are not fully understood.  \n    Although mankind was always exposed to nanoparticles \nfrom natural sources such as volcano outbursts and forest fires, \nthe systematic exposure of humans to man-made nanoparticles \nstarted with the invention of fire. With first industrial \nachievements came also first reports on susceptibility of hu-\nman health to fine dust and sub-micro sized particles. These \nreports date as back as two thousand years ago to stone crush-\ners in quarries, workers in coal mines and welders exposed to \nmetallic fumes. Households are no exception when it comes to \ngeneration of nanoparticles. Pure wax candles can release 250 \n000 nanosized particles per cubic centimetre during one eve-\nning. Smoke released by one cigar can contain more than 70 \n000 nanosized particles per cubic centimetre [8]. A recent \nstudy has shown that some laser printers release nano-particles \n[9]. Nanoparticles are also used in the food and cosmetics in-\ndustry to improve, e.g., the processibility or appearance of a \nproduct. \nB. Hazard and Risk Associated with the Use of \nNanoparticles \nGenerally there are three ways of human exposure to \nnanoparticles: skin penetration, inhalation and digestion. \nTheoretically skin can be penetrated intercellularly, tran-\nscellularly and along the hair shaft. Fortunately skin is rela-\ntively thick, consists of several layers and is shed regularly \nand thus penetration by ordinary (not coated with biologically \ncompatible agents) nanoparticles is less likely [10]. There are \nmany uncertainties though. For example it is not clear whether \nnanoparticles could penetrate through wounds and cuts. In \nsome skin conditions the thickness of skin can be significantly \nreduced and thus risk of penetration by nanoparticles is in-\ncreased. It is also difficult to assess what happens to nanopar-\nticles deposited on skin surface by application of sunscreen \ncontaining nanoparticles during physiotherapeutic massage \nwhen the nanoparticles might pierce the skin. \nThere are two possible ways for nanoparticles to enter hu-\nman body during inhalation. The first path, through nasal cav-\nity and along the olfactory nerve leads directly to brain [11]. \nThis has been confirmed in inhalation studies of carbon \nnanoparticles in rats. The second path, via alveolar-capillary \nbarrier in lungs allows penetration of nanoparticles into the \nblood stream and human body natural filters \u2013 liver and spleen \n[12, 13]. It should be realized that human lungs have more \nthan two thousands kilometres of airways and area of about \n150 m2. Penetration sites for nanoparticles are thus plentiful. \nSince females have thinner airways than males different depo-\nsition rates are expected for males, females and children [14].  \nDuring inhalation of nanoparticles part of them will be de-\nposited in the mouth cavity and will end up in the digestion \nsystem with food. Once in the digestion system, nanoparticles \ncan penetrate through gastrointestinal barrier into the blood \nstream and end up in liver and spleen [15]. Nanoparticles from \nover-worn porcelain bridges were observed in liver of patients \n[16]. The critical point in these studies was that non-toxic ma-\n  \n \nterials (porcelain) caused health problems and even death. \nPatients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases such as \nCrohn\u2019s disease have abnormal intestinal permeability which \nmay allow for easy penetration of nanoparticles. \nIn general, the smaller the nanoparticles, the further is the \ntranslocation in human body and once in human body \nnanoparticles mostly create damage by generating oxidative \nspecies which cause oxidation of human body.  \nThe effect of nanoparticles on environment was examined \nin several studies. For example, it was observed that Al2O3 \nnanoparticles inhibited root growth in plants [17]. Fullerenes \nin sub-lethal concentrations changed behavioural patterns of \nDaphnia which in turn increased risk of predation and in-\ncreased reproductive decline [18]. It was observed that sub-\nlethal doses of fullerenes led to bio-accumulation in Daphnia \nwith lethal consequences. Several types of nanoparticles \n(MgO, TiO2, fullerenes and most notably Ag) were found to \nbe bactericidal [19,20]. The concerns of wastewater treatment \nplants related to penalties for release of toxic waste harmful to \naquatic organisms led to regulation of antibacterial nanosilver \nin the USA with re-call of products such as washing machines \nor clothes using or containing nanosilver. Further claims were \nthat nanosilver is highly toxic even in low concentrations and \nit accumulates in clams. There are several hypotheses to ex-\nplain antibacterial working of nanoparticles. Since bacteria \nand spores are usually negatively charged due to presence of \ncarboxyl groups, they are electro-statically attracted to posi-\ntively charged nanoparticles. Since many types of nanoparti-\ncles have sharp edges these by a simple act of abrasion cut \nthrough the walls of bacteria and thus physically destroy them \n[19]. \nIt should be born in mind that most of the toxicological \nstudies focused on a single type of nanoparticles. It is likely \nthat in natural environment, with many types of nanoparticles \npresent, various synergy effects will take place. \nC. Safety measures and risk assessment related to \nnanoparticles in power industry \nFour areas of human exposure to nanoparticles have to be \naddressed when adopting safety measures in power engineer-\ning industry: 1) production of power equipment. It is preferred \nto work with liquid suspensions, pastes or granules rather than \ndry powders, and closed rather than opened manufacturing \nsystems should be used. 2) storage and transportation. The \nmost common danger present spills, vapour leaks and fire dur-\ning accidents. 3) operation of equipment. Nanoparticles can be \nreleased into environment via mechanical abrasion, ablation \n(surface discharges, flashovers) or from equipment fires. 4) \nend of equipment lifetime. Ecotoxicity of nanoparticles and \nsudden catalytic reaction with risk of explosion in incinerators \nhave to be considered during recycling and waste disposal of \npower equipment. Preparation of ionic solutions instead of \nsolid nanoparticles and creation of microagglomerates may \naddress these challenges. \n \nIt should be borne in mind that toxicity of materials de-\npends on the magnitude and duration of exposure. Manufac-\nturers of toxic materials follow several basic rules which can \nalso be used for work with nanoparticles and nanomaterials. \nThese are: minimize the number of people working with \nnanoparticles, minimize the time spent in environment with \nnanoparticles, maximize protection (wear nano-proof certified \nclothes and masks, use glove boxes), perform a toxicology \nstudy for a given nanomaterial. \nIt is important to prevent formation of dust and aerosols in \nthe workplace. A small under-pressure in the working area is \nrecommended to prevent escape of nanoparticles to other \nworking areas. Ventilation systems are to be equipped with \nnanocertified filters to prevent outflow of nanoparticles to na-\nture. Cleaning of the working place should be performed by \nmoping up or extraction systems but never with blowers.  \nIn absence of clear rules some manufacturers perform \nmeasurements of nanoparticles in the ambient air in their fa-\ncilities on a voluntary base. These measurements are usually \ncarried out by certified health and safety authorities. It is im-\nportant to realize that the number of nanoparticles in air may \nvary with the time of nanoparticle production and location in a \nfactory.  \nToxicology studies are usually expensive (up to a few mil-\nlions of USD) and take several years but this cost is insignifi-\ncant compared with the penalties paid by companies in asbes-\ntos victims trials where it was usual to pay several hundred \nmillions USD per company. A typical toxicological study \nshould include [21]: 1) detailed particle characterization. This \nusually means measurements of spatially resolved chemical \ncomposition (coating, bulk), size distribution, agglomeration \nstate with statement on desagglomeration tendencies, shape \n(spherical, irregular, rods, sharp edges), crystal structure, sur-\nface area, surface chemistry, surface charge, porosity, fibre \nflexibility, solubility, biopersistance, protein adsorption, and \nmany others. 2) exposure to at least three doses. Long-term \nlow-level exposure experiments are important because of pos-\nsible accumulation of nanoparticles in human body. 3) data \ninterpretation against mass, surface area and number of \nnanoparticles. 4) nano versus micro control study. Independent \ntoxicological institutes should perform such studies. \nSince the field of nanotoxicology is relatively new and \nregulation is either entirely lacking or is in preparation there is \na risk that small companies which lack human and financial \nresources would introduce products harmful to humans and \necosystem to financially benefit from the present lack of regu-\nlation without long term legal consequences [22]. Introduction \nof basic rules from the health and safety authorities is there-\nfore necessary.  \nAlthough the field of risk assessment related to short- and \nlong-term human and environment exposure to nanoparticles \nis new, the awareness and first steps towards responsible use \nof nanoparticles has been made by governmental and also non-\ngovernmental organizations [23-28].  \n \n[1] G.

MORE ASSETS YET NOT A PANACEA! \nSo is nanotechnology going to be seen as the universal \npanacea of the ills of electrical insulation bestowing on it an \ninfinite lifetime?  Well probably not but, even considering that \nworkers are more likely to publish \u201cgood\u201d results than \u201cbad\u201d, \nthe results so far seem overwhelmingly positive. A reasonably \nwide range of properties covering electrical, mechanical, ther-\nmal and chemical characteristics have been reported, often \ncomparing a conventional insulating material with and without \n\u201cnanoparticles\u201d, and sometime one containing \u201cmicro-\nparticles\u201d. An example of the latter is epoxy resin containing \nsilica particles in the range 1 to 100 \uf06dm, a formulation that is \ncommonly used in low and medium voltage switchgear for \nexample.  \nA. Electrical Breakdown Strength \nPerhaps the most important property of an insulator is its \nbreakdown strength. Conventional fillers tend to reduce the \nbreakdown strength, however there are indications that well-\ndispersed nanofillers with appropriately functionalized surface \ncan increase the breakdown strength.  Fig. 1 shows results on \ncrosslinked polyethylene with a variety of such fillers. The \n\u201cTES\u201d treated nanosilica formulation has a breakdown \nstrength at 25\uf0b0C of 446 kV\/mm compared with 269 kV\/mm \nfor unfilled XLPE.  \nVaughan [2] have shown similar effects with nanoclay fill-\ners in PE, they also demonstrated the effect of particle disper-\nsion on the breakdown strength. \nB. Voltage endurance and electrical treeing \nFor insulators in service, an equally important characteristic \nis the voltage endurance: the time to failure under a given field. \nRoy et al [1] have shown this in the same XLPE systems as \n \n \n  \nFigure 1. The cumulative probability of breakdown (DC, uniform field) as a \nfunction of electrical field for crosslinked polyethylene containing different \nnanoparticles. TES=Triethoxyvinysilane, AEAPS \u2013 aminpropyl-\ntrimethoxysilane, HMDS = hexamethyldisilazane [1]. \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 2. Voltage endurance for 10% loaded epoxy resin loaded with 10% \n(a) microparticles and (b) nanoparticles of TiO2; after [3]. \nshown in Fig. 1. Another example of this is shown for filled \nepoxy resin in Fig. 2. In this work, the insulation was subject to \na divergent electric field from a 4\u03bcm point electrode under a \n60 Hz AC field (which may have resulted in electrical trees.)  \nExtrapolation to fields that are used in service (~10 kV\/mm) \ndemonstrates the increased lifetime of such systems when using \nnanofillers. \nImai et al have demonstrated that electrical trees occur in \nsuch systems, but are ameliorated by nanoparticles, e.g. Fig. 3. \nIn the nanocomposites, most \u201cbushy\u201d trees, i.e. with a higher \nfractal dimension, grow in the nanocomposites under similar \nconditions as the path is continuously interrupted by the pres-\nence of nanoparticles. This influence of fractal dimension on \ntime-to-breakdown is well known (e.g. [5]). \nC. Water tree growth  \nWater (or \u201celectrochemical\u201d) tree growth occurs in XLPE \ncables subject in which the insulation is subject to high \nhumidities. Preliminary results by Hui et al [6] suggest that \nwater treeing is also reduced by the introduction of \nnanoparticles, in this case SiO2 particles with a trioxyvinyl-\nsilane coupling agent. This is shown in Fig. 4 (frequency = 1 \nkHz, 5kV Ashcraft samples, 0.5 m NaCl.) It is less clear how \nthis mechanism operates. The workers suggest that reduction \n  \n \nFigure 3.

Water tree growth for XLPE-SiO2 nanocomposite with loadings of: \n0% (\uf075), 5% (\uf06e), and 12.5% (\uf081) ; (after [6]). \nin treeing can be attributed to a scattering effect generated by \nthe interfacial region between the nano particles and polymer \nmatrix; however exactly why such a scattering effect would \nexist in water trees is not explained. \nD. Partial Discharge erosion  \nPartial discharge (PD) resistance may be evaluated using a \nrod electrode suspended above the surface of the polymer insu-\nlation allowing the measurement of erosion depth. Characteris-\ntics of epoxy \u2013 titania nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 5.  \nIt was found that both particle and layered silicates have a \nsimilar effect in reducing partial discharge erosion. Silane cou-\npling agents are also helpful. As the size of the particle is re-\nduced from 1.6 \uf06dm to 1.2 nm the PD resistance appeared to  \n \n \nFigure 5. Erosion depth versus PD time for epoxy \u2013 titania nanocomposites at \n60 Hz, 6 kV  (after [4]) \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 6. Development of maximum electric field due to space charge \naccumulation ; (after [8]). \nincrease. Tanaka et al explained this in term of the inorganic \nmaterials being more resistive to PD erosion and the dispersed \nnanoparticles preventing longer higher-energy discharges tak-\ning place.   \nE. Space charge accumulation  \nThe incorporation of nanoparticles also appears to reduce \nspace charge accumulation in some systems. This is somewhat \ndifficult to show as the particles tend to corrupt the measure-\nments (e.g. [7]), but this is largely possible to overcome. Space \ncharge accumulation in an insulator subjected to a high field \nleads to field variations within the material. Instead of the field \nremaining constant throughout the material, there are areas \nwhere the field can be considerably higher, possibly leading to \npremature breakdown. Fig. 6 shows how the maximum field \nincreased with time due to the build up of space charge in 10% \nTiO2 filled epoxy, a sample approximately 0.71 mm thick was \nsubjected to 3 kV at room temperature leading to an average \nfield of 4.2 kV\/mm. After about 15 minutes, the sample filled \nwith microparticles exhibited significant charge accumulation \nleading to a maximum field of ~ 10 kV\/mm. The nanocompo-\nsite field remained at ~5 kV\/mm. With possible significant \ndevelopments in HVDC systems, understanding and control-\nling space charge accumulation is likely to become much more \nimportant in such systems. Similar results in the reduction of \nspace charge have been found for polyethylene nanocompo-\nsites, e.g. [9]. \n \nF. Mechanical tensile characteristics \nThere is a summary of the mechanical and thermal proper-\nties of dielectric polymer nanocomposites in the recently pub-\nlished book on this subject [10]. \nMost nano-filled composites have mechanical properties \nthat are below those expected from theory; this is largely due to \nproblems of dispersion and ensuring that the mechanical loads \nare transferred effectively to the nanofillers. Improved func-\ntionalisation and processing has improved their properties.  Fig. \n7 compares the mechanical tensile behaviour of PVA and that \nfilled with carbon nanotubes. Significant improvements in both \nthe ultimate tensile strength and the modulus are observed.   \n \n \nFigure 7. Stress-strain characteristics of PVA with and without 0.8% wt% \ncarbon nanotubes; taken from [11]. \nG. Thermal expansion  \nMismatches between the coefficient of thermal expansion \n(CTE) of the polymer matrix and the nanofiller can induce mi-\ncro-cracks that significantly age the material after thermal cy-\ncling. Such micro-cracks lead to reduced tensile stresses as the \nmechanical load is unequally distributed between the host and \nfiller. Rigid nanofillers can reduce the CTE mismatch. Work \nreported by Huang et al among others[12-13] incorporating \nnanosilica into a polyimide prepared from pyromellitic anhy-\ndride and oxydianiline was much lower than that of the near \nresin. As the filler loading in wt% was increased the CTE de-\ncreased in ppm\/\uf0b0C from ~40 at zero loading to ~10 at 30% \nloading.  Irwin et al [10] cite similar effects in other systems. \nWhilst the examples here cannot hope to represent the full \nbody of work developed since the first reported improvement \nin electrical properties only 8 years ago [14], the incorporation \nof nanofillers into insulating systems has given rise to generally \npositive results. A universal panacea? That is still to be proved. \nThe cost of processing and production may be a hindrance to \nimplementation as may be the natural conservatism of the in-\ndustry, which has resulted in excellent reliability to date. It \nseems however, that the optimism and hope expressed in early \nconsiderations of the potential of nanodielectrics (e.g. [15]) are \nbeing justified by an ever expanding body of experimental evi-\ndence. \n \n[1] M.

PROGRESS TOWARDS USEFULNESS \nIn the preceding chapter, more dielectric properties were \ndiscussed. Force is to conclude that progress has been made; \nthe facts show this. The facts imply as well that nanostructura-\ntion does not come as a solution for every improvement re-\nquired by the applications. \nCircumstances and new events may help in the emergence \nof applications. Although, nanostructured enamel was studied \nfor a long while already, it is only recently that the technology \nis commercially offered. Thus, section A below was devoted \nto these materials. \nAt last, nanodielectrics, according to their properties, will \nfind their way into electrotechnical applications. CIGR\u00c9 is \nabout to publish a technical brochure [1] in which one com-\nplete chapter is devoted to electrotechnical applications. But \nthe scope of applications for nanodielectrics is believed to be \nmuch wider. To illustrate this point, section B introduces an \nexample dealing with gas sensing. \n \n[1]  T. Tanaka and M.F.

Conventional and nanocomposite enamel behaviour \nunder varying humidity \nA characterization study of conventional and nanocompo-\nsite enamels with varying the relative humidity (RH%) envi-\nronmental test conditions has been carried out. Twisted pair \nspecimens have been realized according to the IEC 60851-5 \nstandard procedure [1]. Two kinds of  wires have been consid-\nered: the first, identified as Conventional Enamel, was insu-\nlated using a double layer conventional polyamide-imide non \ncorona resistant enamel having an outer diameter of  1 mm and \nan enamel thickness of 26 \u00b5m, while the second commercial \none, identified as Nanocomposite Enamel, was insulated by \nmeans of a nanocomposite enamel. This latter is basically com-\nposed by a first polyamide-imide enamel layer and a second  \nlayer of polyamide-imide enamel containing nano-sized (15 to \n20 nm) silica particles: the outer diameter amounts to 1.27 mm \nand the enamel thickness is 47 \u00b5m. All the tested specimens \nhave been conditioned at least 24 h at the same relative humid-\nity level set for the tests. The experimental activity has been \ncarried out applying to the specimens a pure sinusoidal voltage \nwaveform at industrial frequency (50 Hz) having a rms value \nhigher than the partial discharge inception voltage amplitude so \nto operate in presence of surface partial discharges. Enamel \nbreakdown has been selected as end point criterion and the \nconcerning lifetime values have been collected. Three speci-\nmens have been tested for each relative humidity level and \nvoltage amplitude. In Tables I and II the obtained lifetimes \nrelevant to Conventional and Nanocomposite Enamels, com-\nputed as the average of the results on the three specimens, are \nreported. \nTABLE I \nConventional Enamel \nVtest [V] RH [%] Average life time [s] \n65 15900 5300 \n35 5720 \n65 40520 3450 \n35 105805 \n65 83760 2460 \n35 240840 \n \nTABLE II \nNanocomposite Enamel \nVtest [V] RH [%] Average life time [s] \n65 12620 9000 \n35 5340 \n65 32920 6800 \n35 33960 \n65 51940 5120 \n35 178500 \n \nBecause of the extremely long obtained life times at the \nlowest voltages, the Nanocomposite Enamel has been tested \napplying voltage waveform having rms amplitudes higher than \nthe ones selected for the Conventional Enamel. Fig. 1 shows \nthe obtained life curves, in a bilog plot, applying to the results \nthe inverse power law. Comparing the obtained results, it is \npossible to evidence that the Nanocomposite Enamel better \nbehaves than the Conventional ones: at both 65% and 35% of \nrelative humidity the Nanocomposite Enamel shows lifetime \nvalues extremely longer than those relevant to the Conventional \nEnamel: the nano-filler seems to produce a barrier effect  \n \n  \n \n \n1000\n10000\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\nTbd [s]\nVt\nes\nt [\nV]\n65% C\n35% C\n65% N\n35% N\n \nFigure 1. Obtained life curves. C=Conventional Enamel, \n N=Nanocomposite Enamel \n \nagainst the PD activity in all the tested conditions as a protec-\ntive ceramic-like layer. Furthermore, Conventional and Nano-\ncomposite Enamels, at the highest test voltage amplitudes, \nbetter behave in wet conditions when the relative humidity is \nequal to the  65% while if medium\/long term performances are \nconsidered, the best behaviour is obtained at the lowest rela-\ntive humidity level. This could be due to the fact that the PD \nactivity and the damaged area dimensions depend on the volt-\nage amplitude and on the relative humidity value:  \n \n\uf0b7 the higher the voltage amplitude the higher the PD \nrepetition rate; \n\uf0b7 the higher the relative humidity the higher the surface \nconductivity and the wider the damaged area (Figs. 2 \nand 3). \n \nIf the 35% RH and highest test voltage values are consid-\nered, it seems that the effects of the relative humidity on the \ndamaged area dimensions are predominant. In fact at this low \nvalue of RH% the PD activity seems to be concentrated in a \nsmall area and the times to breakdown decrease. If the test \nvoltage is decreased and the 65% of RH is considered, it  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Damaged area: Nanocomposite Enamel, 35% RH, 9000 V. \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Damaged area: Nanocomposite Enamel, 65% RH, 9000 V \n \nseems that the relative humidity effect on the surface charac-\nteristics becomes predominant. In fact at the 65% of relative \nhumidity, the surface conductivity is higher than at the 35% \nencouraging the PD activity and partially compensating the \nPD repetition rate reduction due to the diminution of the test \nvoltage amplitude. This results into a reduction of the times to \nbreakdown. \n \n[1] IEC Publication 60851-5, \u201cWindings wires \u2013 Test method \u2013 Part 5 Elec-: \ntrical properties\u201d, Edition 3.2, 2004-10. \n \nB. Nanocrystalline metal oxides in gas sensing applications \nRecent reports let believe that nanostructured metal oxides \nare becoming the key materials for developing semiconducting \ngas sensors with improved gas-sensing properties [1,2]. De-\nspite the availability of several gas detection techniques, metal \noxide sensors share a significant part of the $2.5B market [3]. \nSimplicity, robustness and low cost are the main advantages of \nthis class of sensors while they suffer from low selectivity, \nhigh operation temperature, and low hydrothermal resistance. \nThe exponential progress in nanofabrication techniques makes \nconceivable the exploitation of their unique properties in gas \nsensing applications in order to overcome most of the existing \nmaterials\u2019 limitations.  \nMetal oxide gas sensors are semiconductors which convert \nthe chemical interaction of the device surface with a given gas \nspecies to a measurable electrical signal through the variation \nof conductivity. Chemisorption is accompanied by charge ex-\nchange between adsorbed gas and oxide surface resulting in a \nchange of surface potential. In an n type sensor, for example, \nthe chemisorbed oxygen creates a potential barrier at the sur-\nface of the sensor particles resulting in a depletion layer at \ngrain boundaries. This provides a potential barrier limiting \nelectron movement and conductivity. Any change in oxygen \nconcentration or heterogeneous reaction of oxygen with a re-\nducing gas affects the potential barrier at the grain boundaries \nand modifies the conductivity [4,5].  \nA suitable material for a gas sensor must not only have ap-\npropriate electronic structure and a good affinity with the tar-\n  \n \nget gases, but must also satisfy a number of other requirements \nsuch as manufacturability, hydrothermal stability, and poison-\ning resistance. Therefore, the choice of material is usually a \ncompromise decision. Simple oxides such as SnO2, In2O3, \nWO3 [2,5] and mixed oxides such as LaFeO3, SrTiO3 are easily \nnamed examples of potential gas sensors [4].  \nPerovskites with a general formula of ABO3, a typical \nband gap of 3-4 eV, and good thermal stability are an interest-\ning choice for gas sensing materials [1,4]. The size difference \nbetween A and B cations makes them flexible to a variety of \ndopant additions allowing for control of semiconducting prop-\nerties [4,6]. \nOne of the synthesis and manufacturing challenges of \nperovskite-based catalysts and sensors is to provide a high \nspecific surface area (SSA) in order to maximize surface reac-\ntions and improve their efficiency and response time. Since \nSSA increases sharply with decreasing crystallite size, nanos-\ntructured materials are of great interest. In addition, when the \ncrystallite size is small enough to be comparable to the thick-\nness of the charge depletion layer, the sensor conductance be-\ncomes very sensitive to the target gas because only a few \nthermal activated carriers will be available [7].  \nHigh energy ball milling (HEBM) is an efficient technique \nfor preparation of a wide range of ultrafine ceramic powders. \nBy optimizing the process parameters, a powder with a desired \ncomposition and a very low crystallite size (down to 10 nm) is \nachievable. In addition, the resulting powder is comprised of \nhard agglomerates having a very high density of grain bounda-\nries. The technique is easily scaled up and offers a reasonably \nlow production cost compared to the other preparation routs. \nConsidering the requirements for gas sensors and the capa-\nbilities of the HEBM technique, this technique has a great po-\ntential to develop highly sensitive and low cost nanoperovskite \nsensors. In addition to significant practical advantages such as \nmass production, low cost and waste-free, a number of other \nadvantages could be conceivable:  \n-   It has been shown that the edges and corners are the \nactive sites for gas\/solid surface reactions [8,9]. The HEB-\nmilled materials are subject to heavy plastic deformations \nduring synthesis leading to a higher quantity of edges and \ncorners which could improve the receptor function of the \nsensors. \n-   Oxygen diffusion coefficient is an important factor \nthat controls the equilibration time between bulk point de-\nfects and surrounding gas. This coefficient being signifi-\ncantly higher in grain boundaries [1,10] indicates that the \nresponse time must be significantly shorter in HEB-milled \nsensors. \n-  Despite the HEB-milled powders being comprised of \nnanocrystallites, the agglomerates usually have a wide size \ndistribution varying from 40nm to a few microns. This will \nimprove the permeability of thick coatings and facilitate \nthe washcoating process; a commonly used process in the \ncatalysis industry. \nMany questions remain to be answered in this domain. \n \n \nSome major ones are formulated below: \nGrain boundary effect: A HEB-milled oxide is basically \ncomprised of large agglomerated (micron size) with crystal-\nlites size down to 10 nm and a great amount of grain bounda-\nries. Oxygen diffusion coefficient is significantly higher in \ngrain boundaries: \nHow the grain boundary diffusion can affect the conductiv-\nity of the agglomerates? \nCoating: Coating is an issue in manufacturing of low cost \nsensors. In order to develop a marketable sensor, a coating \ncapable of meeting the thermal shock, adhesion, and vibration \ntesting requirements is needed. Washcoating is considered a \npotential method due to its simplicity and adaptability to in-\ndustrial processes.  \nHow can we improve the adhesion of coating and reduce \nthe gap of thermal expansion coefficient between the coated \nlayer and substrate (alumina is usually used as substrate) \nwithout compromising the sensitivity of the sensor? \nThermal stability and Poisoning: Although we expect to \nreduce the operation temperature of sensors by increasing the \nsurface area and modifying their morphology, some sensors \nmust work at high temperatures. In general, nanomaterials \nwith lower recrystallization temperature do not have very good \nthermal stability. This issue could be addressed by adding \ngrain growth inhibitors during milling. The addition of grain \ngrowth inhibitors may affect the electrical continuity of the \nsensing layer. So: \nHow the thermal stability of a nanocrystalline mixed oxide \ncan be improved? \n \n[1]  G.

CLOSING REMARKS \nThe preceding festive writing stemming from a Halloween \ngathering amazes \u2026 It stands as a testimony of various aspects \nof the situation and\/or domain. \nOn the verge of the years 2000, there was for sure a change \nof paradigm and many scientists adapted and engage in this \nnew research. Force is to say that the dielectric community, at \nleast involving electrotechnical applications, had lacked en-\nthusiasm and vision towards the end of the nineties. The emer-\ngence of a new class of dielectrics, ca. 2001 and first experi-\nmental data evidencing nanocomposites as dielectrics in 2002 \n[1] stirred things up for the last decade. \nThis document shows as well that a multidisciplinary ap-\nproach is a must with this topic, and it has worked here. Sci-\nence starts to make progress when a vision is elaborated; for-\nmulating the right questions and\/or asking various scientists to \nshare their views on some unknowns is a first major step to \nleap into the future. Nanodielectrics have definitively a future. \nThis is supported by the present document. \nIt is John Fothergill who came up with this idea of pana-\ncea. In those times, there would be a roving person going from \none city to the other offering syrups, ointments, powders, and \nsome miraculous bottles that were presented like universal \nremedies, efficient to heal all, \u2026 that is a panacea. \n \n \n \nTherefore, adapted to our field, the question arose \u201cAre \nnanodielectrics a panacea?\u201d. The answer to that question is \nno! In some cases, an electrotechnical application does not \nrequire the use of nanodielectrics. In some other cases, the \nmeagre gain exhibited by the use of nanodielectrics does not \nwarrant its use. What is true however is that sometimes the use \nof  nanodielectrics may offer a substantial and dominant gain \nin a non-dielectric property, e.g. weight. \nIt is not a panacea, but \u2026.  progress as made explicit and \nthe still opened questions surely support a real potentiality that \nlies ahead, a potentiality that started to transform itself into \napplications.  \n  \n[1] J.
