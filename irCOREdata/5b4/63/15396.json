Introduction  \nProfessional business communication is becoming increasingly intercultural, virtual, and \nchange focused in the face of workforce diversity and the globalized business arena. These forces \nof change have emphasized the need for successful exchange of professional and business \ncommunication across cultural boundaries. Yet how people engage in and successfully negotiate \nintercultural professional communication\u2014the work related communication processes in which \npeople from differing cultural backgrounds come into direct contact and interaction with one \nanother (Kim, 2001; Scollon & Scollon, 2001)\u2014is under-researched. In particular, how culture \ninfluences this communication across cultures, especially where promotional communication and \nadvertising is concerned, is even more problematic.  \nThis paper responds to this gap by investigating the complex cultural interpretations both \nproducers and audiences apply to professional texts, and the potential miscommunication that \nmay ensue. Specifically, the paper offers a situation focused approach to investigating \nintercultural professional communication by exploring how audiences in one cultural context \ninterpret a professional text and give direct feedback to the producers of that text who are in \nanother cultural context. Drawing on an approach used by Pan, Scollon and Scollon (2002), we \nanalyze a two-year project in which business students produced a \u201ctext,\u201d sent it to students \noverseas who are potential clients of the text, and then exchanged feedback on the text. In the \nproject the \u201ctext\u201d was a special case of rich professional communication in the form of a seven \nminute video clip that aimed to promote a specific university program. Through our analysis of \nthe situation specific elements that constitute the exchange of texts, we illustrate the ways in \n 3 \nwhich producers invoked meaning by using words, images, and symbols, and how the audience \nresponded to and interpreted those texts.  \n \n1.1. Intercultural business communication \nStudies have documented how culture affects international business communication \n(Ding, 2006; Graves, 1997; Holmes & Zaidman, 2007; Varner, 1988), and how these cultural \ndifferences create problems in international business communication exchanges (Ding, 2003; \nZaidman, 2001). Other studies have suggested that current research tends to ignore the complexity \nof international business communication, i.e., it is not simply communication between \nrepresentatives of nations or cultures (Starke-Meyerring, 2005; Varner, 2000; Yuan, 1997; \nZaidman, 2001); instead, we also need to consider intra-cultural differences.  \nA preliminary question in research that considers cultural differences is how to \nconceptualize culture. The more static and traditional views of culture (Varner, 2001) lead to two \napproaches in professional communication\u2014the universalist and the particularist. The universalist \napproach emphasizes the search for communication universals with an attempt to create \npresumably culture-free texts or images.  \nThe particularist approach produced lists of traits (e.g., Hofstede, 1991) to consider when \nwriting for various, presumably homogeneous, national audiences (Starke-Meyerring, 2005). The \nparticularist approach has been defined in the more general intercultural communication research \nas the global-culture approach by Cai and Donohue (1997). In applying the approach, the analyst \nbegins with a description of a value that is assumed to be embedded in the culture and derives \nfrom that observation a series of predictions about how participants in that culture will behave \n(Janosik, 1987). Differences in communication are explained by comparing the values of two or \nmore cultures and focusing on them as the primary unit of investigation (Fisher, 1988; Stening, \n1979; Varner, 1988; Vertinsky, Tse, Wehrung & Lee, 1995). Major dimensions of global cultural \n 4 \nvariation used in intercultural communication include individualism-collectivism and high-low \ncontext differences (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988).  \nHowever, in our view, and based on recent research, international business \ncommunication is not simply the communication between representatives of nations, or of \ncultures. Rather, communication in the global world is much more complex (Varner, 2000; Yuan, \n1997; Zaidman, 2001). Thus, the multifaceted and diverse nature of intercultural business \ncommunication means that earlier frameworks of communication are limited. For example, in a \nculturally diverse workplace Hymes\u201f (1974) notion of \u201cspeech community,\u201d where members of \nthe community hold shared cultural characteristics, is unlikely to be found. Similarly, the well-\ncited cultural dimensions approach (e.g., Hall, 1990, Hofstede, 1991), underpinned by the \nassumption that all the participants in category A adhere to a cultural trait (such as individualism), \ncannot be applied to globalized diverse settings and has already been heavily critiqued for \nessentializing difference and people within cultures (see for example, Chuang, 2003; Hegde, \n1998) and for its neglect of context and other situational factors (Hegde, 1998; Katriel, 1995).  \nAn alternative approach is the culture in context perspective. It includes a relatively small \nnumber of studies that focus mainly on intercultural interactions among individual business \npeople in a negotiation setting. This group of studies includes research that has shown that \nbusiness people do not fully conform to one cultural code and that they adapt to specific situations \n(Cai & Donohue, 1997; Drake, 2001; Francis, 1991). From the culture in context perspective, \ncommunicative behavior is locally managed. Although culture is not ruled out as an influence, \ncontextual, relational and identity factors of the interaction play an important role in affecting \ncommunication behavior. The management of interchange is influenced by pragmatic aspects, \nsuch as the context in which the communication takes place and the needs of the interactants to \nfulfill their role requirements and to conform to the norm of reciprocity, e.g., the way negotiators \n 5 \nfrom different cultural backgrounds modify their behavior in intercultural interactions (Adler & \nGraham, 1989; Cai & Donohue; Drake).  \nAn extension of this approach is the situation focused communication approach which we \npropose here. While this approach shares similarities with the culture-in-context approach in its \nfocus on contextual variables, it is different from it in two aspects. First, rather than focusing on \nthe group of participants in the context of negotiation, the situation focused communication \napproach extends this approach to include an investigation of individual \ncommunicators\/negotiators as the primary focus of investigation in the setting of their \ncommunication, and the culturally diverse business communication style and language repertoire \nthat each individual brings to the context. The focus thus extends to the situation of negotiation, \nand in particular, the situation of each of the interactants as they perform and exchange \nprofessional business communication \u201ctexts.\u201d And, as highlighted in this study, as a group of \npeople from one country engage in professional business communication with a group in another \ncountry, not only does the group itself comprise a culturally diverse team, but the context also is \noften pluricultural. Thus, there is a need to recognize and acknowledge the diversity of both the \ncommunicators and the pluricultural context in which the communication takes place, including \nthe situation of exchange.  \nSecond, this approach considers a plural definition of culture, that is, culture is not \nconceptualized as a single, monolithic concept as it is often presented within the culture in context \nresearch, but rather as a collection of co-cultures comprising individuals who are co-existing and \ninteracting alongside one another (Orbe, 1998). As well as the professional\/business culture of the \ncommunicators, this approach also includes such demographic factors as age, gender, and \nprofessional roles as factors influencing communication. Thus, how audiences construct meanings \nof the written and visual aspects of producers\u201f professional texts, as well as the social, contextual, \nand relational meanings they apply to these texts, all might contribute towards explaining the \n 6 \nnature as well as the challenges of intercultural business communication. It is from this \nperspective that we seek to explicate a study of professional communication that explores how \naudiences negotiate the socially and culturally constructed meanings of professional texts in \npluricultural contexts.  \nAlong with the need to develop theoretical approaches that recognize the complexity of \nglobalized professional communication exchanges, there is a call for a more practically-oriented \nunderstanding of the field (Reinsch, 1991; 1996), which also has pedagogical significance. This \ncall has been articulated most notably in business communication textbooks, suggesting that \ninternational business communicators need to understand the basic features about cultures, \nrecognize cultural diversity and differences, and develop intercultural sensitivity towards such \ndifferences both within and across nations and cultural groupings (Carte & Fox, 2004; Hoft, 1995; \nSriussapdaporn, 2006; Weiss, 1997).  \nFrom a pedagogical perspective, scholars have demonstrated the use of visual materials to \ndevelop intercultural sensitivity (Wilkinson, 2007). They also emphasized the importance of \nteaching intercultural business communication in MBA classes, preferably through interactive \nmethodologies (Goby, 2007; Starke_Meyerring, 2005) and team approaches (Cockburn-Wootten, \nHolmes, & Simpson (2008). For example, Starke-Meyerring argues that professional \ncommunicators who operate on the basis of a concept of culture as hybrid, heterogeneous, \ncomplex, and constantly renegotiated need to be able to engage in collaborative inquiry across \nvarious boundaries to identify multiple perspectives, genre conventions, tacit assumptions, and \ninterpretive strategies. These various strands provide resources for new shared, negotiated, and \ntransformed meanings. For this purpose, students need to develop a set of heuristics with which \nthey can better understand, discuss and reflect on their own written and cultural literacy practices. \nSuch heuristics can help them later, as professional communicators, to negotiate genre \nconventions and other assumptions about the structure of communication, and examine possible \n 7 \ncommunication problems jointly with other team members or with their audiences in diverse \nintercultural settings. We respond to this methodological call in this paper through our \nintercultural exchange of a professional text, and through the theoretical and methodological tools \nwe apply in analyzing the findings.  \nIn the following sections of the paper we discuss our two research questions and the \ntheoretical framework we draw on to answer these questions, namely concepts and approaches \nfrom the fields of visual anthropology and advertising. Next, we explain their application in the \nresearch design of the study. We then present and discuss the emergent findings from the \naudience responses to a promotional text (in this case, the video clips) in light of these \nframeworks. We conclude by evaluating the contribution of our approach and the insights it offers \nto better understand intercultural professional communication. \n1.2. Conceptual frameworks and research questions \nOur study aims to understand how people from differing cultural backgrounds engage in \nand successfully negotiate intercultural professional communication. More specifically, we want \nto explore the complex cultural interpretations that both producers and audiences apply to \nprofessional texts, and therefore, why miscommunication may occur. Therefore, the study focuses \non the exchange and interpretation of rich professional communication in the form of advertising \nor promotional video clips that aimed to promote a specific university program. The clips, \nalthough containing words, were saturated with images. In order to understand this form of \nbusiness communication we adopted two culture sensitive frameworks: Chalfen\u201fs (1987) \nframework of home-made visual communication, and McCracken\u201fs (1988) framework of the \nmovement of meaning in the world of consumers\u201f goods.  \nChalfen\u201fs (1987) framework includes several useful elements for understanding how \nmeaning is communicated through visual images. The author suggested four elements that can be \nused to analyze home videotapes: participants, settings, topics, and style. The participants \n 8 \ncomponent involves anyone who appears in the clips. We would like to discover who was chosen \nto be an actor and who was excluded. The setting component refers to when and where the images \nor activities take place. The topic component describes the main topics or arguments that the \nstudents decided to present. The style refers to the general mood that is projected (e.g., light, \njovial, serious) in the clip. Although Chalfen\u201fs framework is designed to analyze home videos, the \nfour identified elements also offer a heuristic for identifying or interpreting the worldviews and \ncultural priorities of the students as filmmakers\/text producers in our study, according to the \nchoices they make about what to include or exclude, what to emphasize, and what to downplay, \netc. Based on what emerged from the data, we also added two more categories: information (e.g., \nthe amount, type, and quality of information), and language. Language emerged as an important \ncategory because the participants and audiences came from a wide range of linguistic \nbackgrounds and many had English as an additional language. Drawing on these elements, we \ninterpreted the clips as reflecting the worldviews and cultural priorities of the students as \nfilmmakers\/text producers.  \nThe second framework derives from culture sensitive research in the field of advertising. \nAs clips are created to promote a specific program or product, they can also be seen as \nadvertisements. Yet, there are differences between professional texts and advertisements. It is \npossible to regard advertisements as \u201ctexts,\u201d in this case, messages that convey meaning via signs \nthat need to be interpreted. To regard advertisements as cultural texts is also to recognize that they \nconvey meaning by using a variety of styles\u2014drama, rhetoric, metaphor, and so on (Domzal & \nKernana, 1992). Yet, unlike professional texts, advertisements are highly manipulated \nrepresentations of recognizable scenes from \u201creal life\u201d (Goffman, 1979). They are always \ncommodity narratives, and typically, are telling stories of success, desire, happiness, and social \nfulfillment in the lives of the people who consume the right brands (Goldman & Papson, 2000). \nFurthermore, the contexts of professional texts and advertisements are different. Advertisements \n 9 \nare part of a hotly competitive advertising industry (Goldman & Papson), while professional texts, \nincluding promotional clips, usually do not partake in such competition.  \nHowever, how can advertising research be useful in analyzing business and professional \ntexts? Advertisements tell the consumers which products and services they should purchase and \nwhat social ideas and values are \u201cnormal\u201d for different segments of the population. Values \nembedded in advertisements can be used to understand the cultures within which they are created \n(Frith, 1998; McLuhan, 1964; Okigbo, Martin, & Amienyi, 2005). Similarly, one can look at the \nclips as advertisements through which the filmmakers are conveying values. We would like to \nexplore what values producers in one situational context communicate and how audiences from \nanother situational context respond to them. \nIn line with this approach we adopted McCracken\u201fs (1988) framework of the movement of \nmeaning in the world of consumers\u201f goods. According to McCracken, meaning is usually drawn \nfrom the culturally constituted world and transferred to the consumer, often via advertisements. \nInstead of discussing the general concept of culture which can be too encompassing, McCracken \nsuggested looking at the culturally constituted world which can be characterized in terms of two \nconcepts: cultural categories and cultural principles. Cultural categories are the fundamental co-\nordinates of meaning. They represent the basic distinctions with which a culture divides up the \nphenomenal world. These categories include time, space, nature, and person which combine to \ncreate many other, secondary categories and the conceptual grid of a culturally constituted world. \nSeveral of these general cultural categories overlap with Chalfen\u201fs (1987) framework. They are \nperson (participants), time, space, and nature. By focusing on these categories, as well as any \nothers that may emerge (e.g., in our study, the categories \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201clanguage\u201d), it is \npossible to interpret producers\u201f choices for making meaning in professional texts, and to explain \npossible communication gaps when the message crosses borders to diverse audiences in another \ncultural context.  \n 10 \nAccording to McCracken (1988), meaning consists also in cultural principles, i.e., the \nideas or values according to which cultural phenomena are organized, evaluated, and construed. \nThey are orienting ideas of thought and action which find expression in every aspect of social life. \nMeaning, to become resident in consumer goods, must be transferred from the cultural world to \nthe good itself. A creative director, for example, identifies in the cultural world those categories \nand principles that most closely approximate the meaning that the consumer seeks for the product. \nThen s\/he selects the elements that are used to evoke meaning in an advertisement. In line with \nthis approach our intention is to identify what cultural categories and principles shape the texts\u2014\nthe images, words, and symbols in the clips\u2014and how these messages are interpreted by a \ndifferent audience from another county. Hence, our first research question: \nR.Q. 1 What variables of both the film makers and target audience influence production \nand interpretation of a professional text? \nSuccess in intercultural business communication can be interpreted in light of Zhang and Gelb\u201fs \n(1996) argument that consumers respond favorably to advertising messages that are congruent \nwith their culture, and reward advertisers who understand their culture and tailor their \nadvertisements to reflect its values. Effective advertisements are those that reflect consumer \nperceptions and expectations faithfully (Domzal & Kernana, 1992). With regard to images, \nseveral studies found that culture influences the interpretation of symbols in technology-based \nbusiness communication (Albritton, Bendriss & Hahs Vaughn, 2006; Hedberg & Brown, 2002). \nFor example, in the case of clip art, Hedberg and Brown found that students did not always \ninterpret visual information in the manner expected by the original designers. Therefore, how \naudiences in situationally and culturally diverse contexts interpret symbols and images in \nprofessional texts also needs further investigation. By applying these arguments to our case we \nquestioned whether the producers of the texts (students) took the role of creative directors, \nidentifying the cultural world of their colleagues (audience) overseas, and therefore, whether they \n 11 \nselected the elements, i.e., words, images and symbols, that evoked culturally appropriate \nmeanings (McCracken 1988). Hence our second research question: \nR.Q. 2. What constitutes a successful \u201ctext\u201d within the context of intercultural professional \ncommunication? \nOur research is a response to the need to better understand the complexity of global \nprofessional communication. It also responds to the critique that, due to limited and conventional \nresearch methodologies, studies in the field support narrow research paradigms on repetitive \ntopics (Tucker, Powell & Meyer, 1995). In this paper we offer a \u201csituation focused\u201d \ncommunication approach that considers the complexity of contemporary global professional \ncommunication.  \nThis approach complements the \u201cculture in context\u201d approach (Cai & Donahue, 1997; \nFrancis, 1991), which focuses on contextual variables, by also including the meaning that \nculturally diverse communicators (producers and audiences) bring to the communication text and \ncontext. To this end, our approach responds to Starke Meyering\u201fs (2005) call for a more critical \nunderstanding of professional business communication, by exploring how professional \ncommunicators identify and interpret multiple perspectives, genre conventions, and tacit \nassumptions to construct new (un)shared, negotiated, and transformed meanings within a more \nfluid and complex understanding of culture. To achieve this goal, we suggest using a qualitative \nmethodology which applies an interactive method as an appropriate heuristic for analyzing \ncontemporary professional communication across and within pluricultural contexts.  \n \n2. Research Design \nThe video exchange project is grounded in a methodology developed by Pan, Scollon and \nScollon (2002). In their project \u201cprofessional communication across cultures\u201d Pan et al. designed a \nprogram by which people in business organizations or governmental agencies could exchange \n 12 \nprofessional communication portfolios across different regional and cultural offices. In each site they \nasked people to develop portfolios of their own best professional communications, for example, \nresumes, videos of presentations, and business cards, which they then sent to two other sites. In each \nsite they led focus groups to look at and respond not only to their own portfolios, but also to the \nportfolios of those from the other sites. In a second round they asked participants to respond to the \nresponses from the other sites in order to initiate a dialog and establish the preferable way of \ncommunication. It is this process that guided and inspired our exchange project. \nThe research design in our study involved eight student groups (with four to five participants \nin each group) in the making and analyzing of eight clips (four made in New Zealand, and four made \nin Israel) as part of students\u201f class work. The student groups each constructed a video of a sales \npresentation: an academic program within the students\u201f respective business schools. The purpose of \nthe clip was to encourage students from the target culture to enroll in the program. The groups were \nnot given any instructions about the production of the clip, except a time limit of seven minutes. The \nclips were then exchanged between the Israeli and New Zealand classes. We conducted the \nexperience over two years. In each year two groups in Israel and two in New Zealand produced a clip \nwhich was then exchanged with their respective audiences in the other country. Therefore, our \nanalysis draws on participants\u201f responses to eight clips in total (1). \n \n2.1 Participants \n As Pan et al.(2002) argue, since the international workplace is complex, it cannot be \nassumed that there are only two cultures involved in an intercultural interaction. Similarly, in this \nstudy, although the professional texts were exchanged between two nation states\u2014Israel and New \nZealand\u2014within each group there was much cultural diversity. The New Zealand group included \nabout one third international students, who came mainly from China; there were also students \nfrom Europe, the Pacific, New Zealand Maori, and other cultural\/ethnic groups living in New \n 13 \nZealand. The Israeli group of students was also diverse. It included Israeli born students as well as \nstudents from the former USSR. Thus, it is not possible a priori to refer to the \u201cNew Zealand \nculture\u201d or the \u201cIsraeli culture.\u201d As we make sense of our data, our situation-in-context approach \nseeks to accommodate an understanding of culture that might also be fluid, heterogeneous and \ncomplex. Similarly, we believe other \u201cports\u201d of business communication exchange, such as \nculturally diverse organizations and multinational corporations, share this complexity in terms of \ntheir communication.  \nThe Israeli class consisted of students enrolled in an MBA degree who were participating \nin a module on culture and international business. The students from New Zealand, in their final \nyear of an undergraduate business degree, were enrolled in a paper about intercultural \ncommunication.  \nAs the project was repeated in the following year, altogether, four clips from New Zealand \nand four from Israel (eight clips in total) made up the data for our analysis. The number of \nresponding Israeli students during the two-year project was as follows: 10, 8, 14, and 14; and the \nnumber of responding students from New Zealand was: 14, 10, 16, and 20.  \n2.2 Method  \n Student audiences viewed the clips produced by their overseas colleagues during their \nclasses. After viewing they were required to write down their responses to the following \nquestions: \n1. What is your first impression of this video tape?  \n2. What worked well in the presentation? \n3. What seemed confusing or unclear? \n4. What was missing? \n5. What was present in the video that seemed unnecessary? \n 14 \n6. What changes would you make to improve the video? \n \n2.3 Data analysis  \nApplying the two culture sensitive frameworks of Chalfen (1987) and McCracken (1988) \ndiscussed above, we analyzed how the participants created their texts through the use of words, \nimages, and symbols, and the cultural and social contexts they chose to explain their texts. We \nalso collated the written responses of the audiences to the questions above to analyze how their \ncolleagues\u2014the student audience overseas\u2014interpreted these texts. Through our analysis we \nwere able to establish the range of cultural as well as other contextual variables that are relevant \nto the communication events of people in specific contexts. \nOur first step was to arrange separately, for each clip, all the responses from the Israeli students \nand all of those from the New Zealand students. For each clip, we divided the responses into the \nfour categories identified by Chalfen (1987): participants, settings, topic, and style. However, \nfrom the data that remained we were able to identify two more categories: information, and \nlanguage, which we have included in the presentation of findings that follows. Our next step was \nto analyze the responses within each category. We collected similar and dissimilar responses and \ngrouped them together into several themes. We repeated the procedure for all the categories \nmentioned above. Since the number of participants was small we decided not to apply a \nquantitative measure, but only to distinguished between dominant themes and less dominant \nthemes. We considered a dominant theme an argument that was raised by approximately half of \nthe number of responses in a specific class (see Appendix A). In keeping with qualitative \nresearch, we also collected and analyzed responses that we considered important, even if they \nwere introduced by one or two individuals only, because we believe that these, too, shed light on \nintercultural professional communication processes. There were also sporadic remarks that we \n 15 \ndiscussed that reflected a response to a unique feature of a specific clip. Thus, we ended up with \nresponses to a set of themes within each of the six topics across eight clips.  \n3. Results  \nIn the following section we present and analyze the responses of students according to the six \ncategories of participants, setting, topics, style, information, and language. The analysis considers \ndata that is relevant to the two research questions of the paper: the variables that influence the \nproduction and interpretation of professional communication texts, and the elements that lead to \nsuccess (or failure) in intercultural professional communication.   \n3.1 Participants (Person) \nOur attempt in this section is to describe and analyze choices regarding the participants in \nthe video clips and the role they played (Chalfen, 1987). We found that, generally, the student \nfilm producers from Israel and New Zealand had different expectations regarding the choice of \nthe participants (who were mainly students and lecturers).  \nThe responses of all four groups of Israelis showed that they preferred \u201cauthority figures\u201d \n(to use their terminology). They expressed this preference by making compliments when these \nfigures appeared in the clips of their student counterparts, as indicated in the following response: \n\u201cIt was good to show staff members such as teachers, advisors and administrators. This helps to \nknow that you do have someone to rely on in case of a question, need, etc.\u201d  \nIsraeli students also praised the appearance of university lecturers on the screen. The \nprofessors were described as pleasant, coming from different countries, and they \u201cdelivered a \nmessage of something serious and interesting.\u201d \nBy contrast, all four groups of students from New Zealand expected to see more students \n(either Israelis or foreigners) in the Israeli students\u201f clips.  \nThese findings demonstrate the limitation of national culture as an approach to explaining \nintercultural communication behavior. We could expect that Israelis, who are low in power \n 16 \ndistance (Meshulam, 1994), would not be so keen about the presentation of authority figures. Yet, \nwe found that they preferred that the message in the clip be delivered by authorized or serious \npeople, i.e., those on whom one can depend. In this case, the dimensions of the national culture \ndid not explain the students\u201f choices, but rather, as we shall explain later, other situational \nvariables provided richer heuristics. \nWhile we found differences between students from Israel and New Zealand in their \nexpectations regarding the participants, they both expressed positive remarks about their \ncounterparts\u201f choices of people who took the role of cultural mediators. For example, one New \nZealand clip included an Israeli lecturer working in the university there. The Israeli students \nremarked on the importance of including an interview with an Israeli professor because it helped \nto reduce feelings of distance. One student said: \u201cI liked that. It shows that they are pro-Israel and \ntoday it is very important for us, to go to places where we are welcomed and can feel safe.\u201d (See \nAppendix B, Video Clip One). These comments show the importance Israeli students placed on \nreceiving communication signals that reduce their anxieties about and distance from a foreign \nplace (2).  \nStudents from New Zealand expressed similar opinions regarding a former lecturer from a \nNew Zealand university, who was teaching at the university of the Israeli student producers and \nwho promoted the Israeli program in two Israeli clips. The New Zealand students commented: \n\u201c[It] makes us feel closer to them; it is something [that] connects both of us.\u201d And \u201c[the] audience \ncould easily identify with him.   \nThus, both populations of students applauded the presence of people who were associated \nwith their own country in the clips of the other group. These responses indicate that there is a \ndistance which can be bridged by \u201ccultural mediators\u201d such as cultural compatriots. \nThe representation of \u201chome\u201d was also performed by an extensive use of objects by the \ncultural mediators whom the audience had praised, such as the Israeli lecturer in New Zealand \n 17 \nwho placed a book with the title in Hebrew clearly displayed while talking to the camera. Another \nexample was the former New Zealand lecturer, now working in Israel, who wore the All Black \nrugby T-shirt and displayed his New Zealand passport. One student commented that such images \ncreated a \u201ccommon ground.\u201d \nStudents\u201f responses about the participants in clips also included remarks about gender \nchoices and sexuality. Students from New Zealand criticized one Israeli clip, arguing that there \nwere no females in it and that \u201cthis can be seen as sexist.\u201d One student said: \u201cThere needs to be a \nfemale point of view in the video, in terms of a speaking part, rather than just visuals of women. \nThis could capture the female market.\u201d \nSome of the Chinese students from New Zealand expressed negative responses about a \nscene of two young people hugging, which appeared in an Israeli clip. The students noted that the \nshot of \u201cthe lovers\u201d was unnecessary, with no relevance, and even embarrassing. One Chinese \nstudent said: \u201cThe embracing couple in the video looks not very proper.\u201d There were also \nnegative remarks from students from New Zealand about another clip in which the camera \nfocused on a young attractive woman who did not speak. The students asked why this image was \nnecessary.  \nHow can the data regarding the choices of participants and the audience response be \nanalyzed? Our initial question is: Can we apply the notion of \u201ccultural category\u201d (McCracken, \n1988) when dealing with such heterogeneous populations as was the case in our study? Our \nfindings over the two years showed that students from New Zealand hold similar perspectives \nabout the cultural category \u201cperson.\u201d The category refers to two basic elements: the first is the \ninclusion of young people; the second is the expectation of equal representation of men and \nwomen. Similarly, consistency also appeared in the choices of Israeli students, who preferred to \nsee authority figures and the representation of men over women as a source of information. Thus, \nthere are differences in the meaning attributed to the cultural category \u201cperson.\u201d  \n 18 \n Both intra- and intercultural differences emerged among the New Zealand and Israeli \nstudent groups regarding norms of interaction in the public domain (Frith, 1998; McLuhan, 1964; \nOkigbo et al., 2005). While Israeli students depicted as legitimate images of intimate relationships \nbetween the sexes and portrayed young attractive women as part of their sales pitch, students \nfrom New Zealand expressed more restricted norms of intimacy in public. Generally, students \nfrom New Zealand perceived women as equal in the public domain of business communication, \nand rejected the choice of \u201cwinking\u201d towards women\u201fs sexuality and using them as objects of \nattraction, a draw card in the Israeli student producers\u201f eyes. Furthermore, some of the Chinese \nparticipants\u201f disapproval of the image of a female embracing a male is indicative of their \ndisapproval of public displays of emotion and intimacy (Gao & Ting-Toomey, 1998).  \nAs noted earlier, the actors in most of the clips from both countries were students or \nlecturers. Thus, the directors chose participants from the (shared) context of the university. An \nexception was one Israeli clip that included actors that were connected to the university, but \nindirectly. The choice to include two honoured graduates, the former French Prime Minister, \nFrancois Mitterand, and in particular, Roberto Benigni, an Italian actor, created much confusion \nfor some of the New Zealand students because they were unknown personalities. One New \nZealand student said: \u201cIt wasn\u201ft clear if they were acting or if they were graduating from the \nuniversity.\u201d Another student suggested that \u201cthe two important people in the commencement \nceremony should have a name title to emphasize how famous and important they are.\u201d A further \n\u201cactor,\u201d unknown to the diverse students in the New Zealand audience, was the statue of David \nBen Gurion, the first Israeli Prime Minister and an important figure in the history of the state of \nIsrael. Students from New Zealand suggested adding an explanation to the statue.  \nScollon and Scollon (2001) argued that communication works better the more the \ncommunicators share assumptions and knowledge about the world, based on common histories, \ncultures, and life experiences. The examples described above demonstrate the difficulty in making \n 19 \ninferences when there is lack of common context. The participants who were not associated with \nthe shared university context created confusion. Thus, we can generalize that in intercultural \nprofessional communication, when the producers of information deviate from the boundaries of \nthe shared conceptual world, in this case, the world of students and lecturers, they minimize the \naudience\u201fs ability to make inferences, and thus reduce the chance to be understood. \n3.2 Settings (space) \nIn the following section we discuss students\u201f expectations and their critical analysis of \nsettings, in the form of the presentation of places, facilities, and geographical space. \nOur findings showed that there is a need for student producers from both countries to \ncapture the macro- as well as micro- setting of the new place. Student audiences from Israel and \nNew Zealand expected to get information about the country, its landscape, and the location of the \nuniversity in the region. Similarly, student audiences from both countries valued pictures of the \nuniversity setting itself, including both its study facilities (e.g., buildings and laboratories), as well \nas the facilities that are associated with students\u201f social life (e.g., student residences). They \nexpected a balanced presentation of the university and its facilities, and the university within the \ngeneral geographical and sociocultural space. They critiqued the clips that were one sided in their \npresentation of either of these two aspects.  \nThe responses of Israeli students to one New Zealand clip demonstrated these findings. \nAlmost all the respondents were not satisfied with the setting. They argued that, generally, the \nNew Zealand clips placed too much emphasis on the presentation of scenery, while too little \nattention was given to the university setting, for example: \u201cThe video begins with a long \ndescription of the lovely scenery of New Zealand, but not because of it [will] students from across \nthe world . . . come to study in this university.\u201d  \nDespite similarities between both Israeli and New Zealand student audiences regarding the \nsetting, we found that slightly more New Zealand students expected to see shots of student social \n 20 \nlife at the university. This finding corresponds with our findings regarding the participants. \nStudents from New Zealand were interested in seeing more students, and in receiving more visual \nand content information about the facilities that are part of student life, including their social life.  \nCommunication problems appeared when students chose concepts and images that were \nrich in local connotations. One Israeli clip focused on the \u201cpromised land,\u201d (the country that God \npromised to Abraham and his people) as the main motive for coming to study in Israel (see \nAppendix B, Video Clip Two). This well known promise, at least among Jews in Israel, appears \nin the bible (Genesis, 15,18). Thus, the Israeli students chose to use a concept that is \u201cthick\u201d in \nterms of its local cultural connotations (Geertz, 1983). But the audience from New Zealand had \ndifficulties interpreting this thick concept. Many of them said that they did not understand the \nmessage about the promised land.  \nAnother example of what appeared as a \u201cculturally thick\u201d concept was found in the \nresponses of Israeli students to the projection of a church in a New Zealand clip. Two Israelis \nsaid: \u201cStudents from New Zealand should know that their target audience is Jewish, and that we \nwill be interested in synagogues and that we do not attend churches. Some people could be \noffended by it.\u201d Here, the Israeli students were using self-reference criteria that pertained only to \ntheir situational context when reviewing the images of a church, resulting in negative evaluations \nand judgments of the New Zealand clip, responses which the New Zealand producers had not \nanticipated. \nThus, as was the case with the category \u201cparticipants\u201d, communication went well when \nstudents provided information that was not \u201cculturally condensed\u201d on the macro and micro level. \nHowever, when producers used culturally thick concepts or images, the audience responded \nnegatively.  \n \n3.3 Topics (time, nature) \n 21 \nWhat main topics appeared in the video clips? Why did student producers choose these \ntopics? And what were student audiences\u201f responses to them?  \nWhere McCracken\u201fs (1988) categories of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d are concerned, two major \ntopics emerged from the data. Further topics to emerge reflected the concerns and interests of the \nproducers and the audience.  \nOne topic appearing in the clips, and significant for both Israel and New Zealand students, \nwas the presentation of life as either relaxed or with a task oriented focus. These foci created a \ncontinuum which we defined as the \u201crelax-study\u201d continuum. Israelis tended to express opinions \nreflecting the importance they attributed to \u201cstudy\u201d and the task oriented side of this continuum, \nwhile New Zealand students expressed views favoring the \u201crelaxed\u201d aspect. An example is the \nIsraeli audience\u201fs response to a clip, which they argued, emphasized themes such as \u201crelaxing,\u201d \n\u201cvacation,\u201d \u201cfree time activities,\u201d and \u201cnature,\u201d rather than studying or promoting a business \nschool. The Israeli students were critical about the message of the clip and the lack of focus on the \nprogram itself. With regard to another clip, several Israeli students commented that there was not \nenough information about the university, the program, and the requirements to get accepted. The \ndominant argument was that there should be more focus on the program and studies rather than on \nnature and relaxation. Several students said that they were confused about the goal of the clip: \u201cIf \nat all, the film convinced me to visit the place rather than to learn there.\u201d A similar position was \nexpressed by a student who argued that \u201cthe University seems appealing to those who like the \noutdoors, but it might have a wider appeal if the emphasis wasn\u201ft so one-sided.\u201d \nStudents from New Zealand, on the other hand, applauded the \u201crelax\u201d aspects as well as \nthe balanced \u201crelaxed-study\u201d themes in the Israeli clips. One student commented that the clip \nshowed \u201ca very colorful and relaxed campus life\u201d and \u201csome freedom, clean, and leisure \natmosphere, it is a high developed place, . . . good environment and facilities for study.\u201d  \n 22 \nThe differences in the content of the New Zealand and Israeli clips, as well as students\u201f \ninterpretations of them, reflect the different perspectives of the cultural categories \u201ctime\u201d and \n\u201cnature.\u201d Student producers from New Zealand, more than students from Israel, chose to exhibit \nsituations that were associated with \u201cleisure time\u201d activities, while Israeli students portrayed \nactivities that were associated with work. Students from New Zealand emphasized \u201cnature\u201d while \nIsraeli students promoted a \u201ctask oriented\u201d setting. When Israeli students focused on nature, they \ndepicted it primarily as idealized nature, that is, the \u201cman-made\u201d nature of the university setting \n(e.g., the planned palm trees and the small stream of water running artificially on a designed stone \nvalley in the university yard); only brief footage was given to the raw nature of the Negev desert.  \nBy, contrast, New Zealand students showed more footage of \u201cwild nature\u201d in the form of \nnative bush, natural streams, and mountains. Research has suggested that nature is an important \ncomponent in advertisements. For example, Green (1996) drew on the pastoral myth, the idea that \nhumanity is both in nature and a part of nature, to demonstrate how nature is encompassed in \nadvertisements for technological products such as automobiles. Similarly, nature appeared in both \nIsraeli and New Zealand students\u201f clips. However, as the examples above illustrate, students in \neach culture emphasised quite different aspects of nature, suggesting the heterogeneous values \nplaced on nature by people from different cultures.  \nAnother topic raised by the student audiences was the juxtaposition of multiculturalism \nand local culture. Students from both countries expressed expectations to see manifestations of \nboth multiculturalism and local culture in the clips. Israeli students said: \u201cThe film succeeded to \npass the message that the program suits foreign students and that the university has students from \nmany different cultures.\u201d Another Israeli student said:  \nIt was good to mention out that this university is based on students from \ndifferent cultures and countries to make future students understand that they \nhave nothing to be afraid and that everybody is in the same position and status. \n 23 \nThis thing helps to lower the anxiety level and to help overcome the fears of \nstudying and succeeding in a foreign university so far away from home. (See \nAppendix B, Video Clip One). \nSimilarly, students from New Zealand expressed interest in the presentation of a \u201cmulticultural \nenvironment.\u201d One person remarked positively about this aspect, while others commented on its \nabsence: \u201ca scene of intercultural communication between native [Israeli] students and foreign \nstudents is missing.\u201d  \nStudents from New Zealand also expressed interest in the representation of the local \nculture. One student remarked that the \u201cbackground music, Israeli national flag, and some Israeli \nstudents close up are very good because these specifics could express their own country \ncharacteristic\u201d and arouse interest. (See Appendix B, Video Clip Two). Another student said: \n\u201cThe Israel cultural experience is lacking.\u201d  \nThe theme \u201csafe place\u201d appeared in a variety of ways in the clips, as well as in both the \nIsraeli and New Zealand students\u201f responses. This theme does not reflect the direct experience of \nstudents within the university setting, but their lives as individuals under the threat of terrorist \nattacks. Altogether, this theme was quite problematic. \nFor example, one New Zealand clip promoted New Zealand as a safe place, which \ngenerally, is a common cultural affirmation among New Zealanders themselves about their \ncountry\u201fs geographical location, isolated from war and terrorism. Israeli students responded \nnegatively. They said: \nTalking about New-Zealand as a safe place is very unnecessary and harmful. \nIsrael, although [sic] its present situation with the Palestinians, isn\u201ft less safe \nthan any other place in the world. Terrorist acts are happening today all over the \nworld (USA, Spain, Turkey, etc.) and saying that Israel isn\u201ft safe is wrong, \nunnecessary, and annoying. \n 24 \nAnother Israeli student said that raising the topic creates antagonism. Similarly, students in \nanother group responded to the same topic: \u201cWe surely know that New Zealand is a much safer \nplace than Israel, but this is a very sensitive issue for us.\u201d And another student commented, \u201cI \nwould have taken out the sayings that New Zealand is a very safe place as opposed to Israel. I \nfound it screeching, and not a wise subject to go into without knowing the Israeli average student \nopinion regarding the subject.\u201d Interestingly, one student from the New Zealand audience also \nreflected on the issue of safety: \u201cIs Israel really safe for us? [The Israeli clip] doesn\u201ft mention war \nwith Iraq and safety issues.\u201d   \nOur results show that topics can be interpreted in unexpected and negative ways. The \nresponse of the Israeli students to the depiction of a church (Video Clip One) is similar to their \nresponses about the notion of a safe place. In both cases the Israeli students responded negatively \nto images and concepts that upset their national and religious feelings. The data presented above \nconfirm the basic instruction of business etiquette that one should avoid discussing religion and \npolitics because they are emotionally loaded. Yet, ignoring a sensitive topic, such as security in \nIsrael, could also raise doubts, as the student in the New Zealand audience pointed out. \nFurthermore, the position taken by the Israeli student demonstrates the need in pluricultural \ncontexts and exchanges to engage people in open discussion of political and religious difference \nin order to break down barriers and avoid the potential conflict and misunderstanding implicit in \nthis example.  \n3.4 Style  \nWhere the general mood of each clip was concerned, a similar set of criteria was used by \nboth New Zealand and Israeli groups. Students from each country applauded clips by using \npositive terms such as: \u201cfunny, cheerful, light, vivid, happy, alive\u201d and \u201cdynamic.\u201d They \ncommented positively in the following ways: \u201cthe clip is selling fun and young spirit. It is a nice \nMTV-like movie, beautiful, contain[ing] humor, clear, attractive, and interesting\u201d (Israeli \n 25 \nstudent), and \u201cthe rhythm of this video is hot [exciting]\u201d (student from New Zealand). The \nnegative terms that they used mirrored the positive terms, for example: \u201cno humour, boring, dry\u201d \nand \u201clacks energy.\u201d Examples are: \u201cthe film seemed to be a bit tiring\u201d (Israeli student), and \u201ca bit \ntoo serious, and a bit too dry\u201d (student from New Zealand).  \nIn general, the pattern that emerged was mixed. That is, Israeli students both applauded \nand criticized clips from New Zealand, using the same criteria and expressing similar opinions as \nthe New Zealand students expressed about the Israeli clips. There were one or two sporadic \nremarks made by New Zealand students that support a previous finding: \u201cIt seems that the clip is \naimed at parents rather than at students.\u201d \nHowever, one exception was an Israeli student\u201fs response to one of the New Zealand clips \nwhich had been filmed in fast forward mode. The Israeli students praised the clip saying that it \nwas \u201cfunny and serious, nice, cheerful and light.\u201d Others said that the clip \u201cgives [a] good feeling, \nmakes you want to be a part of them;\u201d \u201cthere was no \u201edistance\u201f at all between us and them, \ndespite of [sic] the geographic distance.\u201d Yet, the majority of the students were critical about the \nfast forward rhythm of the movie, which was perceived as \u201cvery confusing,\u201d \u201cexhausting,\u201d and \ncreated difficulties for grasping new information.  \nThus, the range of responses within both the Israeli and New Zealand groups to the \nstylistic features of the videos suggests the need to consider how audiences within a culture \nrespond differently and that individuals bring their own constructions and interpretations to \nvarious stylistic effects.  \n3.5 Information  \nThis category is the first of two that we added to Chalfen\u201fs framework. As the student \naudiences\u201f comments below suggest, this category was important in enabling us to identify the \nextent to which participants felt that the clip provided sufficient and quality information about the \nprogram of study.  \n 26 \nIsraeli students in three groups expected more information about the university (e.g., \nlocation of the university); the university facilities, such as library, studying rooms, laboratories \nand dormitory; the program (e.g., the number of courses); the program\u201fs benefits; tuition fees and \nscholarships; descriptions of social activities (e.g., parties, night clubs, sports facilities); profile of \nfaculty members; and students\u201f employment possibilities.  \nThe positive remarks showed that Israeli students were looking for concrete data. They \ncomplimented information on any of the topics mentioned above, as indicated by the following: \n\u201cOne thing that I found missing in the clip was data, information, more depth. There was too \nmuch fun in the clips and less information.\u201d They also commented that there was \u201ctoo much stress \non nature and area [scenic] pictures\u201d and that the details about courses, scholarships or any \nresearch opportunities were missing. One student said: \u201cAre [sic] those guys really want me to \nstudy there??? If so, why haven't they supplied me with important information.\u201d \nBy contrast, the New Zealand students\u201f responses to the information in the Israeli clips \nwere both positive and negative. Some argued that the clips were \u201cvery informative;\u201d others \nthought that they contained too much information; still others thought that some information was \nmissing. For example, about half the students were positive about the information provided in one \nclip. They applauded the information regarding how the program works, who may apply, the \noverview of the University, size and location. Yet, other students were negative, arguing that the \nclip contained a lot of information and that \u201cit is a little overwhelming.\u201d One of them said:  \nI wouldn\u201ft use as much information as it becomes overloading and distracts you \nfrom the important information. I found that there wasn\u201ft really any information \nthat actually grabbed my attention to actually want to go to Israel. I was interested \nin the social aspects of the university. This would influence my decision to go \nthere to study. \n 27 \nTo summarize, the respective student audiences demonstrated a range of different \nexpectations regarding the amount and type of information that should be presented in the clips. \nGenerally, students from Israel expected detailed information. Several students from New \nZealand responded in similar way, while others argued that the Israeli clips included too much \ninformation.  \n3.6 Language  \nAs a result of the emergent data, as noted earlier, we added a second category to Chalfen\u201fs \n(1988) framework: language. In this study, both groups consisted of linguistically diverse \naudiences, and both groups had bi- or multicultural language policies underpinning their national \nidentity. Student audiences\u201f responses to language covered areas such as language choice, accent, \nclarity, and metaphorical language.  \nWhere language choices were concerned, one Israeli student spoke positively about the \nuse of Hebrew in a New Zealand clip: \u201cHearing an Israeli talking in Hebrew about the university \nmakes a great difference and really helps to lower the anxiety level and to help overcome the fears \nof studying and succeeding in a foreign university so far away from home.\u201d Other students said \nthat hearing Hebrew (even just one word, \u201cShalom\u201d) made them feel at home. Similarly, New \nZealand students commented on the use of the Maori word \u201cKia ora\u201d or \u201cHello.\u201d The use of this \ngreeting is common in New Zealand, even among non-Maori speakers, and the New Zealand \nstudents commented that hearing this greeting created a common ground and empathy with their \ncultural context. Thus, for both groups, greetings in a language that is familiar to the target \naudience helped to lessen cultural distance and language anxiety.  \nSecond, both Israeli and New Zealand student audiences commented on the difficulty they \nhad in understanding the actors\u201f accents. In the case of Video Clip One (see Appendix Two) in \nresponse to the question \u201cWhat was confusing or unclear?\u201d Israeli participants referred to their \ndifficulties in understanding what the actors were saying due to their accent. Similar responses \n 28 \nappeared in relation to the other three New Zealand clips, although to a lesser extent. The Israeli \naudience suggested using a narrator with an American accent: \u201cI would let the American girl to \npresent the program since her accent is much more understandable by Israelis\u201d. Several Israeli \nstudents recommended using subtitles \u201cin order to overcome the sound, language and accent \ndifficulties.\u201d They also suggested choosing actors who could speak more clearly. While the \nstudents from New Zealand appeared to be less concerned about accent, like Israelis, they were \nconcerned about speed and clarity. For example, the majority of the New Zealand student \naudiences\u201f responses to the clip \u201cThe promised land\u201d said that the presenter talked too fast and \nthat it was hard to understand the narration. They asked for \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cslow speaking\u201d narration. \nLikewise, in clips where actors spoke slowly and clearly, student audience responses were \npositive. Both Israeli and New Zealand audiences recommended the use of text on the screen, in \nthe form of captions and subtitles, in order to clarify and add information. \nA final point concerned the use of metaphor. Two New Zealand students questioned the \nmeaning of the statement of one of the Israeli actors that \u201cmiracles happened everyday.\u201d The \nstudents asked: \u201cWhat is the \u201emiracle\u201f which the first professor mentioned in his speech?\u201d They \nsuggested: \u201cIt would have been great to have examples shown.\u201d \nThus, student audience evaluations applauded the adoption of greetings in the target \nlanguage of the audience to reduce language anxiety, lessen distance, and create feelings of \ncommon ground. They also negatively evaluated accent in that it created a barrier to message \nreception. Comments from both countries also suggested that student producers had not given \nsufficient thought to the linguistic diversity and knowledge of their target audiences. Finally, \nlanguage choice, in this case, metaphorical references, created gaps in message understanding.  \n \n4. Discussion  \n 29 \nThe audiences\u201f responses within the various categories identified in the findings above \nindicate the importance of understanding the cultural references that each member brings to the \ninterpretation of a text in professional business communication in a global context. That student \naudiences interpreted the six categories of participants, settings (space), topics (time, nature), \nstyle, information, and language in a range of different ways is indicative of the ways in which \nindividuals within an audience may construct understandings of cultural messages in texts. In \nlight of these multiple interpretations of the clips, what, then, are the variables of both the film \nproducers and the target audiences that, in this specific situation, influence the production and \ninterpretation of professional texts?  \nOur data show that several variables do have an impact in this process. These are 1) \ndemographic features, in particular age, 2) differing socio-cultural environments, and 3) differing \nintra- as well as intercultural values. \nThe first variable is the gap in age between students from New Zealand and those from \nIsrael. This gap is also expressed in the student audiences\u201f life cycles: Israeli students are slightly \nolder compared to students from New Zealand. The majority of them have families, and fulltime \njobs. These students started their academic career at the age of 22 to 23, after their mandatory \nservice in the Israeli army. They began their second degree at the age of 26 or27. On the other \nhand, students from New Zealand, including the international Chinese students, were enrolled in \nthe third or fourth year of their undergraduate degree and tended not to have professional work \nexperience, having moved from secondary to university education for the most part. Their \nrespective attitudes towards study reflected these experiences. For example, the Israeli audience \npreferred specific and detailed information about the program of study which might enhance their \ncareer prospects whereas students in the New Zealand audience, in particular, the New Zealand \nborn participants, in keeping with their preference for a \u201crelaxed\u201d approach to university life, \nwere more concerned about balancing pleasure with study. \n 30 \nWe believe that this gap has an impact on students\u201f expectations regarding the actors in \nthe text as well as on the desired information. Thus, for students from New Zealand, the category \n\u201cperson\u201d referred to the inclusion of young people. They were interested in seeing more students, \nboth male and female, and in receiving more information about the facilities that were part of \nstudent life. By contrast, Israeli students preferred to see authority figures that reflected the \nquality of the university and program.  \nThe gap in age also explains different expectations regarding the amount and quality of \ninformation that should be presented in the clips. Students from Israel expected detailed \ninformation that demonstrated the quality and nature of the program, and several students from \nNew Zealand responded in a similar way. Yet other New Zealand students argued that the Israeli \nclips included too much information of a \u201cserious\u201d nature, with not enough emphasis on the social \nenvironment of the university  \nThe second variable influencing the production and interpretation of texts is the general \nsocio-cultural environment of both producers and audience, reflecting on their choices regarding \n\u201ctime\u201d and \u201csettings.\u201d Students from New Zealand chose to present situations that were \nassociated with \u201cleisure time\u201d activities, while Israeli students focused on activities that were \nassociated with \u201cwork time.\u201d These differences could be attributed to age gaps as discussed \nabove, but also to the competition for employment opportunities in Israel (depicted in images of \nmultinational companies where graduates from that program might expect to work). By contrast, \nthe responses of the New Zealand audiences, including the Chinese international students among \nthem, seemed less concerned with career prospects, perhaps because for the most part they were \nunmarried and much younger.  \nFurthermore, students from New Zealand emphasized the setting \u201cnature,\u201d while Israeli \nstudents focused on task-oriented settings. When each group did focus on nature, they interpreted \nit differently, with the Israeli students focusing on the \u201cman-made nature\u201d of the university setting \n 31 \nwhile the New Zealand students preferred \u201cwild nature.\u201d The different choices made by the \nproducers in depicting the socio-cultural environment can be interpreted as resulting from the \ninfluence of the central role of the nature truism in New Zealand (which does not exist to the \nsame extent in Israel), as well as on age differences between the students from both countries. \nSuch choices can enhance or reduce affinity between producers and their audiences, thus \nimpacting on the success of the communication. \nThird, the cultural background of the student audiences influenced their interpretation of \nthe clips. Students of Maori origin who were members in one of the teams from New Zealand \nused Maori symbols such as the haka\u2014a Maori war dance commonly used as a welcome to \noverseas visitors ). The New Zealand producers also chose both contemporary images of popular \nculture or \u201cKiwiana\u201d (the toy bumble bee, and the soft drink \u201cLemon and Paeroa\u201d) and the fern \nfrom which the national emblem, the silver fern, is derived. Instead, the clip produced by a group \nof Chinese international students showed greater resemblance to the Israeli clips in that it \neschewed \u201cwild nature\u201d for a more pragmatic representation of the program in line with the Israeli \nthemes of quality of the program, depicted by its \u201cnumber one\u201d rating across business schools in \nNew Zealand, and verified by an \u201cauthority\u201d figure as was also demonstrated in some of the \nIsraeli clips.  \nChoice of images also needs to consider the moral and ethical backgrounds of the \naudience. The Chinese students\u201f disapproval of the image of couples embracing in public can \nperhaps be attributed to their Confucian values of morality and virtue, and the need to behave \nappropriately in order to bring respect to the family. For a different reason\u2014that of gender \nequality\u2014images of women as alluring, as portrayed in one of the Israeli clips, were also \ncriticized by New Zealand born female members of the audience because they showed women as \n\u201csex objects,\u201d thus denigrating their role as equal and contributing members of society. Gender \nequality is a strong value among both New Zealand males and females. That the Israeli producers \n 32 \nchose such images can be interpreted as reflecting their tendency for \u201cpermissible boundaries\u201d \n(Shamir & Melnik 2002) Thus, a piece of professional communication might include images that \nare subject to multiple interpretations across pluricultural audiences, as well as invoking \nconflicting value judgments.  \nRegarding our second research question\u2014What constitutes a successful \u201ctext\u201d within the \ncontext of intercultural professional communication? we found that confusion appeared when \nstudents chose concepts and images that were rich in \u201clocal connotations\u201d and were not related to \nthe shared world, such as the notion of the \u201cpromised land.\u201d Negative feelings, creating failure in \ncommunication, were aroused when student groups made references to religious monuments other \nthan their own,(for example, the Israeli audience\u201fs disapproval of the image of a cross on a church \nsteeple), or when they referred, even in an indirect way, to the political situation (for example, the \nIsraeli audience\u201fs negative reaction to the theme of New Zealand as a safe place, from which the \nIsraeli students inferred that their New Zealand audience must consider Israel to be unsafe). \nSuccessful elements in texts took place when students from both countries created bridges \nover cultural differences by using elements from their common professional culture. That is, both \nIsraeli and New Zealand populations shared the world of being students in a management school \nin a \u201cWestern\u201d university. When producers designed a text by using elements from their shared \ncontext (i.e., the university) communication went well.  \nFurthermore, the presence of \u201ccultural mediators\u201d who represented \u201chome,\u201d by an \nextensive use of participants, symbols\/images, and language was useful. Positive audience \nresponses to these themes indicate that there is a distance which can be bridged by \u201ccultural \nmediators,\u201d thus making connections between the lived experiences of the audience and the \nproduct being advertised.  \nThe findings from this study suggest several implications for promoting successful \nintercultural communication in professional business communication contexts. Our emergent \n 33 \nfindings indicate that producers of professional texts should consider the appropriate \nrepresentation of the actors or participants in their texts, including their nonverbal communication \nand the roles they enact (see Goffman\u201fs (1979) categories for the analysis of gender advertising, \nand Waters and Ellis (1996) regarding sexuality in advertising). They should assess their own \nexpectations as well as those of their audience, regarding the quality and amount of information \npresented. While doing so, producers might consider several communicative characteristics of \ntheir audience, for example, the value the audience places on context (i.e., low context or high \ncontext, Hall, 1990), and the ways in which power distance is portrayed among actors. They \nmight also acknowledge the extent to which the audience has been exposed to, for example, the \nutilitarian discourse of professional communication texts (Scollon and Scollon, 2001; Zaidman, \n2001). They should consider the values and meaning that their audience might attribute to the \nwords, images, and symbols that are chosen in the representation of objects, places, and activities \nas well as those associated with time and setting such as \u201cnature.\u201d Thus, for example, the \nnostalgic orientation to nature and its manifestation in advertising (Green, 1996) should not be \ntaken as universal.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe \u201csituation focused communication approach\u201d was used to analyze the exchange of \nprofessional communication among two interculturally diverse audiences. Rather than \nemphasizing the \u201cculture\u201d of the communicators, this approach focuses on the situation of the \nexchange, including various components that have an impact on the exchange such as the \ndemographic characteristics of the participants (e.g., age and gender) and their roles. The \napproach also highlights the importance of acknowledging the multiple perspectives and \ninterpretations members of inter- and intraculturally diverse audiences bring to the professional \nbusiness communication text. The situation focused communication approach accommodates the \n 34 \ncomplex and heterogeneous global work setting and suggests a way to accommodate the \nchallenges we face in intercultural business communication.This approach can be applied to the \nstudy of a variety of  professional texts such as selling or promotion clips, power point \npresentations that include images, company brochures and manuals, etc.  \nThe framework we applied here, adapted from Chalfen (1987) and McCracken (1988) in \ntheir analysis of visual text and advertising, was a valuable heuristic for interpreting and \nevaluating intercultural professional business communication. As our study showed, two \nadditional categories\u2014information and language\u2014emerged in the process of data analysis. \nHowever, researchers can use other analytical tools depending on the text itself. As discussed \nearlier, the analysis should consider relevant components (or variables) of the specific exchange \nsituation, which might be different from those variables that emerged in the explanation of our \ndata.  \nFinally, in order to get as close as possible to understanding the audience\u201fs point of view, \nwe suggest eliciting the audience\u201fs direct feedback to and interpretations of the text (as suggested \nby Pan et al., 2002). We found that the interactive method, developed in their approach, resulted \nin raising text producers\u201f awareness of the impact and manifestations of various variables on the \nbusiness text. These tacit aspects of audiences\u201f responses to professional texts emerged only as a \nresult of our request for direct feedback from the audience. The method enables producers to \nunderstand the meaning that is associated with the text and the challenges that audiences in \nintercultural professional business contexts face in interpreting them. Furthermore, researchers \ncan analyse this feedback to identify and interpret communication gaps as they emerge from the \nrange of these situation variables and categories. The approach can also be used as part of the \nteaching process in business schools, as was the case in our research. \n 35 \nWe believe that the situation focused communication approach is of great relevance to the \nunderstanding of global professional communication. It considers a group of producers and their \naudiences as the primary focus of investigation, alongside their production and interpretation of a \nprofessional text. In doing so, it tackles one of the most important aspects of international \nprofessional communication exchange, that of global work teams, which has been described as \nbecoming the norm in both business and non-governmental organizations (Distefano & \nMaznevski, 2000).  \nNotes \n(1) The video clips produced by the students in this professional exchange can be viewed at the \nhome page of Dr Prue Holmes at \nhttp:\/\/www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz\/staff%20List\/index.asp?alpha=H&type= \n(2) In this paper we discuss a special case of exchange where the participants were called to move \nto another country. This shift involved a need to bridge distance between the familiar and \nunfamiliar. Students talked about \u201canxiety\u201d regarding the act of moving to a new place. The \nresponses from both sides reflected the desire of the audience to be familiar with the people. They \nasked questions such as: Who are the students? Are they like us? Since they come from a different \ncountry, would they accept us? Research in uncertainty reduction theory shows that, as \nindividuals acquire more information about one another, their uncertainty should decrease and \ntheir relationship should escalate to a more intimate level (Roloff & Anastasiou, 2001). Thus, \ninformation, as well as the mediation of cultural brokers, can reduce distance and lower anxiety.  \n 36 \nReferences \nAlbritton, F. P., Bendriss, R., & Hahs-Vaughn D. L. (2006).

Then, two male \nstudents say \u201cKia ora,\u201d (a Maori greeting meaning \u201cHello\u201d), and then lecturer A, a female, talks \nabout the reputation of the School in New Zealand. Lecturer B introduces herself. The two \nstudents then move across the physical environment of the campus, which is shown in fast-\nforward mode and accompanied by dynamic music. The students arrive at an office with a sign: \n\u201cJob.\u201d Lecturer C, a female, opens with \u201cshalom\u201d and \u201ckia ora.\u201d Lecturer B talks about the \nsuccesses of the School\u201fs graduates in the job market. Then Lecturer A speaks about the high \nreputation of the School.  \nNext, the two students move in fast-forward mode again across campus. The camera \nfocuses on four female students; three look foreign (two wear traditional Muslim garments and \none is of Chinese ethnicity). They talk about a friendly, flexible school. The video returns to \nLecturer C who discusses careers. The students are shown again in fast-forward mode crossing \nthe campus. The video switches again to Lecturer B, who talks briefly about core courses. Again, \nthe students move in fast-forward mode.  \nThe camera then introduces a consultant, a male with an East Asian appearance, and \nimmediately after that, focuses on a female standing at the School\u201fs reception desk. The clip shifts \nagain to the students crossing the campus in fast-forward mode. The consultant then gives a \nrelatively long explanation about services for foreign students. There are more fast-forward \nscenes as the students move to the entrance of the School. Next, Lecturer D, an Israeli, speaks in \nHebrew about the quality of the School. The dynamic music changes to soft music. The clips \n 43 \ncloses with the following title: \u201cBest education, best opportunities for graduates; safest and best \nlearning environment; best decision you will ever make.\u201d The final image is a symbol of the \nUniversity and an address for further information.  \n \nVideo Clip Two (produced by students from Israel) \nThis video clip, entitled \u201cWelcome to the promised land,\u201d promoted the full-time honours MBA \ndegree. At just over 4 minutes, the clip had a fast pace and detailed information about the degree \nand institution. The title appeared as a white caption over images of the Negev dessert\u2014flora, \nlandscape, a waterfall, an eagle, and the sun setting over the sea. Then came the white caption on \na black background \u201cand the promise,\u201d followed by a pan of the adjacent flags of Israel and the \nuniversity and the university\u201fs name in both English and Hebrew. Topics covered in the MBA \nwere then shown in black and white captions and narrated, followed by a series of images \nshowing the university learning environment\u2014contemporary buildings, students on campus, an \nLCD display of the stock market, classrooms, computer rooms, gardens and accommodation. \nSimultaneously, the narrator described these images, focusing on the advantages of studying at \nthe university, the benefits to students, the qualification\u201fs value, links to top universities in the \nUnited States, the quality of the professoriate, the state of the art knowledge and facilities, and \nIsrael\u201fs global connectedness. Further images of multinational companies demonstrated Israel\u201fs \nlinks with leading international and domestic markets. These images were accompanied by soft, \ncalm music beneath the narration. The narrator then concluded (which included a caption \u201cTo \nconclude\u201d) by showing two famous people receiving their degrees\u2014the former French President, \nFran\u00e7ois Mitterand, and a famous Italian actor who spoke of his pleasure in receiving the award. \nFinally, a white caption showed the Web site for further information for viewers, set against the \nbackdrop of the main building showing the University\u201fs logo and name (in both English and \nHebrew). \n 44 \n \n"}
