These studies have typically\nused complete valves that are cross-sectioned along\ntheir axis of maximum growth, and thus provide the\nmost complete geochemical record through its life\nhistory. However, in some cases complete valves are\nnot available for geochemical analysis, and at pres-\nent it is not understood how stable isotope profiles\nappear around the concave shape of a bivalve. For\nexample, sediment coring can fragment shells and\nthus only a portion of the shell is retrieved for\nisotopic analysis. Alternatively the shells may have\nbecome fragmented through human and\/or natural\ndepositional processes.\n[3] In order to fully utilize shell material that has\nbeen fragmented either through the process of\ndeposition or retrieving samples via coring we\nhave investigated the distribution of stable isotopes\nin a single species of bivalve, Saxidomus gigantea\n(Deshayes, 1839). The possibility of shell isotope\ninhomogeneities is the main concern which could\narise due to several reasons, including the follow-\ning: (1) proximity to the location where the pre-\ncipitating fluid is produced; (2) faster growth rate\nat the axis of maximum growth compared with\nadjacent areas; and (3) other undefined biological\nfractionation processes [e.g., Rosenberg and\nHughes, 1991; Goodwin et al., 2003a, 2003b;\nCarre\u00b4 et al., 2005]. The results of this study will\nhelp contribute to the current understanding of\nbivalve shell stable isotope geochemistry, and\nwhether fragmented or partial valves can be used\nin paleoclimatological studies. Two types of tech-\nniques have been employed in this study:\n[4] 1. A Hendy-type test [Hendy, 1971] is a tech-\nnique that is typically applied to speleothem stud-\nies in order to determine whether the speleothem is\nin isotopic equilibrium with its surrounding envi-\nronment. In the case of speleothems the test is used\nto determine if processes such as limited amounts\nof bicarbonate in solution and\/or evaporation have\naffected the isotopic composition of the carbonate\nalong a growth horizon [e.g., Lauritzen and\nLundberg, 1999]. The Hendy-type test involves\ntaking a series of samples along a growth horizon\n(Figure 1a), where in principle, all the stable-\nisotope values should be the same if the precipita-\ntion of carbonate is in equilibrium. A similar, but\nlower-resolution study was conducted by Klein et\nal. [1996] on the bivalve, Mytilus trossulus, who\nindicated significant changes in d13Cshell at the\nlateral margins, and minor changes in d18Oshell.\nRecently, problems associated with sampling at the\nmargins in speleothems have been identified, in\nthat the difference between the drill diameter\n(0.5 mm) and the size of growth horizons (down\nto the micron scale) would mean that sampling a\nconsistent layer would be very difficult [Lauritzen\nand Lundberg, 1999].\n[5] 2. Previous studies using sclerochronological\ntechniques have sampled along the maximum axis\nof growth (axis 3 in Figure 1b), in order to capture\nall possible time preserved in the shell. Another\nmethod in which to determine reproducibility would\nbe to sample multiple axes of growth (Figure 1b):\ntermed multiaxial growth analysis hereafter. Using a\nprominent growth line as a marker along the shell,\nthree or more transects can be produced in which a\ndirect comparison can be made.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Sampling Strategy\n[6] Stable-isotope profiles of two modern S. gigan-\ntea specimens collected from Namu, British Co-\nlumbia, Canada (16 August 2006; lat: 51.867, long:\n\u0001127.867) were generated along the axis of max-\nimum growth in order to show the cyclicity\nrecorded in these bivalves. These samples were\ncollected during low tide and were located within\nthe intertidal zone. One of these modern samples\n(MNBC 4) was used for the Hendy-type test and\nmultiaxial growth analysis outlined below.\n2.1.1. Hendy-Type Test\n[7] A traditional Hendy test is accomplished by\ndrilling a series of samples along a time-equivalent\nhorizon, most typically applied to the isotopic\nanalysis of speleothems. In our Hendy-type test\nthe left valve of a modern S. gigantea was used.\nThe surficial portion of the valve (<0.5 mm) was\nremoved using an aluminum oxide grinding stone\nattached to a dentist-type drill. The shell was then\nwashed in an ultrasonic bath using deionized water.\nDiscrete sub-samples along and beside the desig-\nnated growth line were drilled to a depth of no\nmore than 0.5 mm below the surface of the valve\n(Figure 1a: total \u00021 mm): the upper prismatic layer\nis between 2\u20133 mm in thickness in these modern\nS. gigantea specimens. Care was taken to remain\nwithin <0.5 mm of the desired growth line, but\ntoward the edge of the shell this type of sampling\ntechnique may homogenize more time than that\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 KINGSTON ET AL.: GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEA 10.1029\/2007GC001807\n2 of 9\nsampled along the axis of maximum growth. Sam-\nple spacing is provided in Figure 1a.\n2.1.2. Multiaxial Growth Analysis\n[8] A multiaxial growth analysis was preformed in\norder to remove sampling errors associated with the\nedge of the shell and determine if fragmentary\nsegments of the shell can be used to construct\nseasonality profiles. Rather than using another mod-\nern shell, the right valve of the same modern\nspecimen used for the Hendy-type test above was\nused (Figure 1b). The valve was cross-sectioned\nfour times, with each cut being as perpendicular to\nthe growth lines as possible (axis 3 being the typical\ncut for sclerochronological investigations). Discrete\nsub-samples were drilled (distance between samples\nwas\u00020.6 mm) from the upper prismatic layer using\na growth line as a reference point (Figure 1b).\nAcross the designated growth band 10 sub-samples\nwere obtained with 8 samples prior to the growth\nband (older) and 2 after the growth band (younger).\nThe distances to each sample point along the indi-\nvidual profiles were normalized in order to make a\ndirect comparison between the profiles produced on\naxes of different length. The normalized distance\n(dn) was achieved using the following equation:\ndn \u00bc distance to point=total axis length:\n2.2. Stable-Isotope Analysis\n[9] Isotopic analysis was carried out on carbonate\npowder that was not treated with peroxide or\nbleach. A common acid-bath ISOCARB system\nFigure 1.

Results are reported in the standard delta (d)\nnotation relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite\n(VPDB). Samples were corrected using NBS-19\nreference material (d13C = +1.95%, d18O =\n\u00012.20%), which had an analytical precision better\nthan 0.1% for both d13C and d18O.\n3. Results and Discussion\n[10] The profiles of MNBC 3 and MNBC 4 along\naxis 3 (Figure 1b) are presented in Figure 2. Each\nof these profiles show distinct cycles in d18Oshell\nthat exhibit larger spacing at the umbo end, with\ncloser spacing toward the commissure. What is\nevident in these profiles is that the magnitude of\nthe d18Oshell tends to decrease with age: a result not\nfound by Gillikin et al. [2005]. Cycles within\nd13Cshell are not as apparent as d\n18Oshell, although\na minor trend (<0.4%) toward more negative\nnumbers from the umbo to commissure is recorded.\n[11] To illustrate the reproducibility between these\ntwo specimens, as shown previously for Mercena-\nria mercenaria by Elliot et al. [2003] and S.\ngigantea by Gillikin et al. [2005], the x axis of\nthe d18Oshell profile of one specimen was fixed\n(MNBC 3) and the other profile (MNBC 4)\nstretched and condensed along the x axis in order\nFigure 2. The d13Cshell (filled) and d\n18Oshell (open) results from a typical analysis along the axis of maximum\ngrowth (axis 3 in Figure 1b) in two modern S. gigantea collected from the same beach at Namu in August 2006.

The last\nvalue for MNBC 4 was deliberately fixed to the\nnearest d18Oshell segment of the curve at the com-\nmissure, since both shells were collected on the\nsame day and thus they should have the same\nd18Oshell value. The different value and trend for\nthe final analyses of each profile may be caused by\nsampling across finer growth increments, based on\nthe fact that MNBC 3 is in a mature phase of\ngrowth, whereas MNBC 4 is senile (Figure 4).\nSenile growth is slower and more irregular than\nmature growth, which leads to a compaction of\ngrowth increments toward the commissure. Thus\nthe last point for MNBC 4 may represent a mixture\nof the last 3 samples recorded in MNBC 3 (i.e.,\ntime-averaging [Goodwin et al., 2003a]).\nFigure 3. Comparison of d13Cshell and d\n18Oshell from two modern S. gigantea. The open symbols represent the shell\nused in this study (MNBC 4). The smaller open symbols at the top represent sample spacing and thus areas that were\ncompressed or expanded in MNBC 4 to fit the profile of MNBC 3. The two cross-plots at the bottom illustrate the fit\nbetween d18Oshell maxima versus d\n18Oshell minima and between d\n13Cshell maxima versus d\n13Cshell minima. These\ngraphs show how good our comparison is as ideally they should fit on the 1:1 line. The open symbols with crosshairs\nrepresent the average and standard deviation of each group.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 KINGSTON ET AL.: GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEA 10.1029\/2007GC001807\n5 of 9\n[12] The reproducibility for d18Oshell is exceptional,\nalthough due to changing growth rates between the\nspecimens and sample spacing some segments of\nthe curve are not represented. Future multiaxial\ngrowth analysis should employ regular spacing as\nthat utilized by Gillikin et al. [2005]. It is interest-\ning to note that reproducible variability mainly\noccurs at the most enriched and depleted segments\nof the profile, which would indicate that each\nspecimen had different levels of tolerance to envi-\nronmental parameters and\/or a result of time aver-\naging. The seasonal magnitude in d18Oshell\ndecreases through the lifespan of both individuals,\nand may be related to environmental and\/or bio-\nlogical factors, or even a time-averaging effect due\nto sampling [Goodwin et al., 2003a]. Reproduc-\nibility in d13Cshell was not as good as d\n18Oshell;\nhowever, there are segments along the profile\nwhere d13Cshell is very reproducible and show the\nsame trends in some years. A similar finding was\nreported by Gillikin et al. [2005]. The differences\nin d13Cshell are possibly the result of the individuals\nhaving varying levels of respired carbon incorpo-\nrated into the shell [McConnaughey et al., 1997],\nsince they were living in the same area and habitat.\n3.1. Hendy-Type Test\n[13] Results from the traditional Hendy-type test\nare provided in Figure 5. Total variability in\nd18Oshell on the growth increment (Transect 1)\nand off the growth increment (Transect 2) was\ngreater than 2.5%. All the data along both transects\nproduced relatively large standard deviations\n(Transect 1, \u00010.39% \u00b1 0.76%; Transect 2,\n+0.11% \u00b1 0.48%). Removing the sinistral portions\nof the profile (3 samples from Transect 1; 1 sample\nfrom Transect 2) the standard deviations are re-\nduced by half (Transect 1, \u00010.13% \u00b1 0.34%;\nTransect 2, +0.20% \u00b1 0.21%). The increased\nvariability at the sinistral portion could be the result\nof the sampling process, but it is interesting to note\nthat d13Cshell shows no significant variability at this\nmargin.\n[14] d13Cshell exhibits far less variability across the\nentire sample set (Transect 1, +0.14% \u00b1 0.15%;\nTransect 2, +0.03% \u00b1 0.09%). Unlike d18Oshell,\nd13Cshell shows greater variability on the dextral\nmargin of the shell, but still within analytical and\nsampling uncertainty. Removing the last 5 samples\nfrom the dextral margins reduces the variability in\nTransect 1 by half but does not reduce the vari-\nability in Transect 2. Again this may be associated\nwith the sampling process, as noted by the overlap\nof isotopic values at the sinistral and dextral\nmargins.\n[15] Klein et al. [1996] report significant d13Cshell\nvariation (between 0.5% to 0.8%) around the\nmargins of M. trossulus in comparison to the\ncentral portions of the shell. In comparison, d18Osh-\nshell recorded very little variation along each tran-\nsect (0.2% to 0.4%). However, this study only\nFigure 4. Thin sections of MNBC 3 and MNBC 4. Note that MNBC 3 is classified as mature, whereas MNBC 4 is\nsenile. The disparity between the final set of d13Cshell and d\n18Oshell values is the result of not sampling at high enough\nresolution in MNBC 4 to capture the same record as that produced in MNBC 3 (see text for discussion).\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 KINGSTON ET AL.: GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEA 10.1029\/2007GC001807\n6 of 9\nanalyzed 3 to 5 samples along each transect around\nthe shell, and hence the variability reported may be\na reflection of errors in sampling. Klein et al.\n[1996] explain the variability in d13Cshell around\nthe margins as a metabolic activity resulting in\nnon-equilibrium effects in comparison to seawater.\nOn the basis of the data in this study, it would\nindicate the opposite in that d13Cshell is in equilib-\nrium around the growth line of S. gigantea, al-\nthough d18Oshell may not be in equilibrium at the\nsinistral margin.\n3.2. Multiaxial Growth Analysis\n[16] A traditional sclerochronological transect of\nthe shell was performed along the axis of maxi-\nmum growth from which 51 samples were ana-\nlyzed (Figure 2). The multiaxial growth analysis of\nthree other slices around a prominent growth line\n(grey region in Figure 1b) produces excellent\nreproducibility for d18Oshell, but not for d\n13Cshell\n(Figure 6). Total variation in d13Cshell values within\nall axes was 1.1% with the highest value associated\nwith axis 3 and the lowest with axis 2. The largest\nrange (0.8%) is seen in axis 3. What is apparent\nwith this comparison is that when d18Oshell values\nare at their lowest the variability in d13Cshell is\ngreatest. However, when d18Oshell approach more\npositive values, d13Cshell values show less variabil-\nity among all axes. It is interesting to observe that\naxis 1 and 2 (dextral margin) exhibit the highest\ncovariance in both d13Cshell and d\n18Oshell, in com-\nparison to the other axes. It is suggested that a\ncomplex interaction between biological effects,\nsuch as metabolic activity (i.e., respiration\n[McConnaughey et al., 1997]), and environmental\neffects (i.e., ecosystem metabolic activity) is the\ncause of the variation in d13Cshell, although subtle\nchanges in growth rate around the margin may also\nbe a factor.\n[17] All four axes have reproducible profiles for\nd18Oshell when normalized for variable axial\nlengths. This suggests that any transect through a\nshell can be used for seasonality analysis, although\nif using shell material closer to the margins high-\nresolution sampling must be achieved in order to\ncapture the full cycle in d18Oshell. The minor differ-\nences in d18Oshell profiles (Figure 6) may be a\nresult of the normalizing procedure and\/or potential\ndifferences in d18Oshell around a growing margin\n(Figure 5, sinistral margin). However, the range in\nFigure 5. The d13Cshell (diamonds) and d\n18Oshell (squares) results from the Hendy-type test on S. gigantea, MNBC\n4 (Figure 1a). Transect 1 (on growth line), open symbols; Transect 2 (off growth line), filled symbols. Arrows point to\napproximate positions for the multiaxial growth analysis (see Figure 1b). There is no significant difference (t test)\nbetween the last five d13Cshell results from the dextral margin and the remainder of the data set.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 KINGSTON ET AL.: GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEA 10.1029\/2007GC001807\n7 of 9\nvalues according to normalized distance is likely\nthe result of the sampling process, because all\nisotopic samples are taken as discrete aliquots\nand not continuously sampled. As a result it is\nnot possible to sample all portions of the isotopic\nprofile using the drilling techniques employed in\nthis study. A future approach would be to take\nequidistance micro-samples on each axis between\ntwo growth lines, and then normalize to growth\nrate between years. A continuous milling method,\nsuch as that used by Scho\u00a8ne et al. [2006] would be\nideal.\n[18] Differences in the portion of the profile used\nin this study are governed by the length of the axis.\nIn smaller axial lengths (e.g., margins) the isotopic\nrecord is recorded through less material and there-\nfore the record is condensed in comparison to axes\nof longer length (e.g., axis 3). For this reason, after\nnormalization of the data the shortest axis (axis 1)\nrecords more of the seasonal profile per unit\ndistance. Axis 3 is the longest, and therefore is\ntypically used in sclerochronological studies to\ngenerate a profile of the whole shell. However,\nwe have extended the normalization technique\nback an extra 8 samples in axis 3 in order to\nencompass the length of the profile recorded in\naxis 1 (Figure 6). The ability to sample more time\nalong axis 3 reveals a small fluctuation at 0.54 on\nthe normalized distance scale, which is not\nrecorded in the shorter axis (e.g., axis 1). To\ngenerate a record with the highest resolution in\norder to show subtle changes it is advisable to\nanalyze the axis of maximum growth (axis 3). If\nlow-resolution or time-averaged isotopic values are\nsufficient, which could be more economical in\nlarger bivalve species, it is advisable to analyze\nthe shorter axis.\n4. Conclusions and Implications\n[19] Seasonal profiles generated from two indi-\nvidual S. gigantea specimens from Namu, British\nColumbia show excellent reproducibility in\nd18Oshell. d\n13Cshell from these two individuals\nshow that during earlier growth stages there\nwas good covariance, although the reproducibility\nFigure 6. The d13Cshell and d\n18Oshell results from a multiaxial growth analysis in S. gigantea, MNBC 4 (see\nFigure 1b). See text for discussion on determining normalized distance.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 KINGSTON ET AL.: GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SAXIDOMUS GIGANTEA 10.1029\/2007GC001807\n8 of 9\nof absolute d13Cshell was poor. Other periods of\ngrowth show good reproducibility; however, the\ncovariance was reduced. Hendy-type tests from an\nindividual used to generate one of the above\nprofiles produced excellent reproducibility along\na growth horizon in d13Cshell, whereas d\n18Oshell\nproduced greater variability especially at the sinis-\ntral margin. Multiaxial growth analysis results\nshow that similar seasonal d18Oshell profiles are\nrecorded in all portions of the shell. d13Cshell\nprofiles did not exhibit very reproducible profiles,\nexcept in axis 1 and 2. As previously suggested,\nmetabolic processes affect the variability in\nd13Cshell, whereas d\n18Oshell is controlled primarily\nby environmental changes independent of internal\nmetabolic activity, hence the poor reproducibility in\nd13Cshell in comparison to d\n18Oshell. Therefore,\nprovided sample spacing is matched to axial length,\nusing a normalization process, shell fragments can\nbe accurately used to investigate seasonal profiles\nin bivalves. d18O profiles of shells from a single\nsite and timeframe can be accurate recorders of\nseasonal changes that also show excellent repro-\nducibility. Fragments from whole shells can also be\nused to generate seasonality profiles, which is\nimportant when investigating shell-poor or frag-\nmented shells from archaeological deposits (e.g.,\nshell middens). Multiaxial growth analysis using\nd18Oshell profiles could prove to be an excellent\nmethod in which to investigate the types [Goodwin\net al., 2003b] and rates of growth in a shell.\nAcknowledgments\n[20] This project was funded by SSHRC to D.
