Non-targeted approaches such as meta-\nbolomics allow for the global description of metabolites in a biological sample and combine\nan analytical platform with multivariate data analysis to visualise patterns between sample\ngroups. In nutritional research metabolomics has generated much interest as it has the potential\nto identify changes to metabolic pathways induced by diet or single nutrients, to explore\nrelationships between diet and disease and to discover biomarkers of diet and disease. Although\nstill in its infancy, a number of studies applying this technology have been performed; for\nexample, the first study in 2003 investigated isoflavone metabolism in females, while the most\nrecent study has demonstrated changes to various metabolic pathways during a glucose toler-\nance test. As a relatively new technology metabolomics is faced with a number of limitations\nand challenges including the standardisation of study design and methodology and the need for\ncareful consideration of data analysis, interpretation and identification. Targeted approaches are\nused to monitor single or multiple nutrient and\/or metabolite status to obtain information on\nconcentration, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Such applications are\ncurrently widespread in nutritional research and one example, using stable isotopes to monitor\nnutrient status, is discussed in more detail. These applications represent innovative approaches\nin nutritional research to investigate the role of both single nutrients and diet in health and\ndisease.\nMetabolomics: Metabolite profiling: Stable isotopes: Nutrient physiology: Diet\nNutritional change is accepted as a cornerstone of public\nhealth strategy in reducing the risk of many of the chronic\ndiseases that face Western society such as obesity, heart\ndisease and cancer. Nutritional status modulates virtually\nall body processes, including various ongoing metabolic\nprocesses(1). Currently, however, there is little under-\nstanding of the individual response to nutritional interven-\ntion and the contribution that specific metabolites and\nmetabolic pathways make in physiological processes related\nto health and disease(2). In trying to elucidate the aetiology\nof multifactorial disease it is well accepted that genetic,\nenvironmental and lifestyle factors are important mod-\nulators. Nutrition also plays an important role as it supplies\nthe metabolome (all metabolites within a biological\nsample). During disease development early events lead to a\nchange to nutrient physiology and\/or changes to metabolic\npathways, which will influence the whole metabolome and\nmay eventually lead to a metabolic disturbance and the\norigins of a disease phenotype. Using traditional bio-\nmarkers and conventional research tools it is not possible\nto identify changes to nutrients and the metabolome at\nthese early stages when nutritional intervention could\npotentially reduce disease risk back to a healthy phenotype.\nHowever, there are now a number of approaches available\nto monitor both single-nutrient physiology and global\nmetabolite profiles, and these approaches have shown\nconsiderable potential in the study of how diet and the\nmetabolome interact. Such approaches can be defined\nAbbreviation: LC, liquid chromatography.\nCorresponding author: Dr John K.

Targeted approaches are usually\nhypothesis testing, as it presumes the target of the investi-\ngation is known (nutrient or metabolite) and the aim of the\nstudy is to measure its status. A non-targeted approach is\nusually hypothesis generating, as typically it is designed to\nprovide a more global description of all metabolites pre-\nsent in a biological fluid; thus, the target is actually the\nwhole metabolome and not a specific species. The aim then\nis to identify species of interest that can be targeted for\nfurther investigation and as such both approaches are\nlinked and complementary to each other.\nNon-targeted approaches: metabolomics\nMetabolomics is a relatively novel technology in nutri-\ntional research and offers considerable potential as a result\nof the wealth of information that potentially can be\nobtained. There is increasing interest in the use of meta-\nbolomics as a tool in understanding the effects of nutri-\ntional intervention on the individual(1,3\u201310). A major\nchallenge is to understand the relationship between\nnutrition and chronic disease, and a metabolomics-based\napproach could be used analytically to predict sus-\nceptibility to metabolic diseases and elucidate molecular\nmechanisms that can explain the beneficial effects of diet-\nary interventions. Furthermore, metabolomics is thought to\nbe a promising tool for biomarker discovery(2), with the\npotential capacity to identify biomarkers of early-stage\ndisease and biomarkers of dietary patterns or individual\nnutrients. Metabolomics is also seen as providing critical\ninformation in the quest to transform current population-\nbased dietary guidelines into future personalised dietary\nrecommendations to help individuals maintain a healthier\nstatus and prevent chronic diseases(11).\nThe technology can be summarised as a global analysis\nor characterisation of all metabolites measured in a biolo-\ngical sample (metabolome). The metabolome is a complex\nmixture of thousands of compounds that arise from intra-\nand extracellular metabolic pathways and external sources\nsuch as food. As a result of the complexity of biological\nfluids, with the large number of metabolites present, data\nfrom biological mixtures are highly complex and generally\nare processed using multivariate statistical analysis includ-\ning pattern recognition. These chemometric measurements\ngenerate metabolic profiles or patterns of metabolites from\nwhich it is then possible to detect changes to the normal\nphenotype induced by, for example in relation to nutri-\ntional studies, diet and metabolic disease. Although this\ntechnology has been successfully used in nutritional studies,\nthere are still a number of considerations for its use.\nMethodological considerations for\nmetabolomic investigations\nMetabolomics requires an analytical platform to supply the\nmetabolite profiles before subsequent data processing.\nA number of technology platforms are available to analyse\nbiological samples but NMR and MS are the commonest\nand each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nHistorically, NMR has been the platform of choice and still\nrepresents the most common method for sample analysis in\nmetabolomics. More recently, MS technology has become\npopular, with both liquid chromatography (LC) and GC\nbeing successfully used. NMR requires no sample pre-\ntreatment and so the spectrum contains information on\nboth small-molecular-weight compounds and proteins;\nhowever, sensitivity is relatively low. MS is highly sensi-\ntive; however, it requires sample pretreatment in the\nremoval of proteins and hydrophobic compounds, thus\nlimiting potential information. Furthermore, the method of\nprotein precipitation or sample treatment also has its own\nanalytical considerations and influences the metabolite\nprofiles obtained. As pretreatment and a separation step are\nneeded, MS is not as reproducible as NMR. A general\nconsideration for metabolomic investigations is that no\nsingle platform will provide information on all metabolites\npresent and a combination of NMR, LC\u2013MS and GC\u2013MS\nwould be required.\nExperimental and analytical variation\nAnalytical design and variation in relation to metabolomics\nhas been extensively investigated(12\u201320). As each platform\nhas its own analytical requirements, variation arises from\nthe methodology used in the study and from the instrument\nitself. Sample collection provides its own issues. Although\nblood concentrations of metabolites are generally under\nsome sort of metabolic regulation, they are dynamic and\nresponsive to acute changes to the diet. Metabolite profiles\nhave been shown to be influenced by the blood collection\ntubes(21), clotting times and clotting procedure(15). Urine\nrepresents an \u2018end point\u2019 of metabolism, and as such is not\nunder any metabolic regulatory control as with plasma or\nserum, and is often the sample of choice in metabolomics\ninvestigations (it also requires limited pretreatment com-\npared with blood). However, urinary metabolite profiles\nare heavily influenced by diurnal variation(12) and the use\nof sample preservatives(22), especially if 24 h aliquots are\nbeing obtained. The extent to which spot urines or first or\nsecond void urines are representative has not yet been\nestablished. The use of faeces (either lyophilised or faecal\nwater) is relatively new but can be useful for gut micro-\nflora investigations. Sample storage is important; no dif-\nferences have been found in urinary or plasma metabolite\nprofiles when samples are stored for 0 or 24 h at 4\u0001C(23),\nbut for longer storage times sub-zero conditions (<- 20\u0001C)\nshould be used(14,22). Freeze\u2013thaw cycles have not been\nshown to influence metabolite profiles using LC\u2013MS(14).\nWhile NMR requires no sample pretreatment, MS\nrequires removal of proteins and hydrophobic lipids. Var-\nious methods for protein precipitation have been compared\nin terms of the number of features obtained(13,24,25), with\nsimilar observations finding methanol treatment to be the\nmost optimal for plasma samples; however, the variation in\nprofiles obtained from each pretreatment method is exten-\nsive. Attempts have been made to further develop and\noptimise the methodology for LC\u2013MS-based metabolomic\nstudies(13,16,17,20,26). It is clear that the analytical conditions\nassociated with MS need to be further optimised and\nstandardised as sample pretreatment, run time, type of\n96 J. K. Lodge\nP\nro\nce\ned\nin\ngs\no\nf\nth\ne\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nSo\nci\net\ny\ncolumn, temperature and LC gradient all influence the\nprofiles obtained(13,16,17,20,26).\nBiological variation\nThere is a complex relationship between genotype, meta-\nbolic phenotype, diet, lifestyle and environment and the\nnutritional needs of an individual(11). Human tissues and\ncells respond to the delivery of nutrients by adapting their\nmetabolic processes through the regulation of gene tran-\nscription, protein levels and enzyme activity. The end point\nof these processes is that the levels of metabolites change;\nhowever, as a result of large inter-individual variations in\ngenotype and phenotype human subjects differ widely\nin their response to nutrients and diet overall(11) and thus\nthere is large inter-individual variability in metabolite\nprofiles.\nThe influence of biological variation has been the sub-\nject of some study(18,19,27,28). Considerable biological vari-\nation in metabolite profiles exists as a result of gender, age\nand BMI(27,28) and it has been possible to classify samples\nbased on these characteristics. Increased plasma choline,\nLDL, HDL and unsaturated fatty acids have been found in\nwomen and increased VLDL, creatine and isoleucine in men\nas discriminators of gender(27). Comparing age-groups, in\nwomen plasma valine, isoleucine, alanine and tyrosine are\nhigher in the older population (>46 years v. 18\u201329 years)\nwhile in men plasma lipoproteins and unsaturated lipids are\nhigher in the older population(27). Discriminators based on\nBMI include choline and citrate, which are higher in a lean\npopulation (BMI<21 kg\/m2), while tyrosine, isoleucine and\nglycoproteins are higher in an obese population (BMI>25\nkg\/m2)(27). Thus, in terms of study design there needs to be\na careful consideration of the population used, with limited\nranges of age and BMI and also taking into account blood\npressure(29), standard clinical chemistry and prescreening\nquestionnaires(10).\nDietary habits heavily influence metabolite profiles, as\nfoods contain thousands of compounds that supply the\nmetabolome. Populations can be classified according\nto various dietary factors(29\u201331) and certain metabolites\nhave been shown to be related to specific dietary pat-\nterns(30,32,33). For example, trimethylamine N-oxide is\nrelated to acute intake of fish(30,31) while taurine and\ncreatine are increased during high meat intakes(30,32).\nCareful dietary standardisation is therefore required before\nsample collection(10,34), and indeed this approach has been\nshown to decrease inter-individual variation in urinary\nmetabolite profiles(34).\nThere is a complex interaction between gut microflora\nand host metabolism(35,36). As diet modulates microbial\nphysiology, products of microbial metabolism can enter the\nhost metabolome causing substantial variability in profiles.\nAlthough urinary metabolite profiles have often been\nused as a natural point to observe such interactions(37),\nrecent evidence suggests that there is a large contribution\nof microbial by-products to the plasma metabolome(36).\nA comparison of conventional (with microflora) and germ-\nfree (without microflora) mice has found numerous signals\nexclusive to the presence of microflora, with approximately\na 10% difference in the metabolite profiles between\nnormal and germ-free animals(36). As well as products of\nmicrobial metabolism of amino acids and other com-\npounds, the study has also found products of host phase II\nmetabolism raised in the presence of microflora, demon-\nstrating a direct effect on host drug metabolism capa-\ncity(36). Faeces are an obvious sample to study microflora\ninteractions, as profiles contain a plethora of compounds\nrelated to microflora metabolism such as SCFA, organic\nacids and amino acid derivatives(38). As the complement of\nmicroflora differs between individuals there is considerable\ninter- and intra-individual variation in profiles(38), but\ninterestingly this variation has been found to be a result of\ndifferences in concentration rather than composition(38).\nNevertheless, as microflora seem to contribute to both\nblood and urinary profiles they are an important contributor\nto biological variation.\nData analysis\nThe data produced by metabolomics experiments are\nhighly complex; for example, >2000 features differing in\nintensity by orders of magnitude are typically represented\nin LC\u2013MS analysis of plasma or urine. As the technology\naims to characterise changes to the metabolome in discreet\nsets of samples powerful multivariate statistical analysis\ntechniques are required to process the data for sample\nclassification and clustering or discrimination. These tech-\nniques essentially are data compression tools; by reducing\nthe dimensionality of the data it becomes easier to visua-\nlise graphically so that patterns between groups of data\n(samples) can be revealed. Both unsupervised and super-\nvised techniques are commonly used. Principal component\nanalysis is an unsupervised method for sample classifica-\ntion. The \u2018principal components\u2019 represent variance\nbetween samples and so samples that are similar in their\nmetabolite profile will cluster together in a scores plot. An\nimportant aspect of this method is that it does not require\ninformation about sample classification and as such is a\ngood starting point to visualise the data. However, princi-\npal component analysis is often unable to classify similar\ngroups, which is typically found in nutritional studies, and\nso other techniques are often used. Supervised methods,\nsuch as partial least squares discriminant analysis, include\ninformation on sample classification, making it more likely\nthat patterns of change between groups are visualised.\nHowever, the downside is that it can lead to overanalysis,\ne.g. partial least squares discriminant analysis will separate\ngroups from random data(39), and as such these methods\nrequire appropriate model validation steps and adequate\ntraining and predictive sample sets, usually with indepen-\ndent data.\nClustering methods, as described earlier, only visualise\ndiscriminated sample groups demonstrating whether the\nmetabolite profiles are different between sample groups.\nThis feature is important to establish, but of greater interest\nis identifying what metabolites are responsible for the\nvariation between sample groups, as this information can\nbe used further downstream in pathway analysis and bio-\nmarker identification. Loadings plots are an extension to\nscore plots in which those features responsible for group\nvariation are visualised. Although this approach provides\nMetabolite profiling in nutritional research 97\nP\nro\nce\ned\nin\ngs\no\nf\nth\ne\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nSo\nci\net\ny\nimportant information on the actual species (e.g. mass and\nretention time in LC\u2013MS experiments), further investiga-\ntive work using metabolite databases (e.g. the human\nmetabolome database(40), METLIN(41)) and confirmatory\nanalysis using standards is required to be fully confident of\nthe assignment.\nIt should be noted that data analysis steps require careful\nconsideration and interpretation in order to be confident of\nobtaining meaningful data.\nMetabolomics in nutritional research\nA number of studies applying metabolomics to nutri-\ntional research have been performed (Table 1). A quick\ncomparison of these studies shows that various analytical\nplatforms and biological samples have been used. Gen-\nerally, NMR has been the most common platform but\nMS has been gaining popularity over recent years, per-\nhaps because of greater availability and improvement in\nanalytical technology and methodology. Urine is still the\ncommonest biological sample used, especially when NMR\nis used as the platform, but a number of studies do\nprofile both urine and blood. It is interesting to note that\nthe first \u2018real\u2019 nutritional metabolomics study was per-\nformed in 2003(42), which highlights the novelty of the\ntechnology. These early studies have shown changes to\nboth the plasma(42) and later the urinary(43) metabolome\nfollowing ingestion of isoflavones (soyabean) in healthy\npremenopausal women. In plasma there are changes to\nlipoproteins, amino acids and carbohydrates following\nintervention(42) while in urine there are changes associated\nwith modification of gut microflora(43). Importantly, the\n\u2018urine\u2019 study used controlled environmental conditions\nwith standardised meals, which perhaps contributed to\nidentifying subtle changes to the metabolome in a rela-\ntively small subject population (five females). A number of\nstudies of differing design have been performed on tea\nmetabolism(44\u201346). While both black tea and chamomile tea\nTable 1.

The first\nstudy to compare diets (vegetarian v. low meat v. high\nmeat) in a cross-over design (twelve men) has found cer-\ntain metabolites characteristic of high meat (creatine, acyl\nand free carnitine, trimethylamine N-oxide) and vegetarian\n(p-hydroxyphenylacetate) diets(32). A comparison of nor-\nmal, low-phytochemical and standardised-phytochemical\ndiets in twenty-one individuals (mixed gender) has found\nincreased hippuric acid excretion during the standard-\nphytochemical diet and increased creatinine and methyl\nhistidine excretion during the low-phytochemical diet(47).\nInterestingly, direct comparison of NMR and LC\u2013MS\nshows a similar classification of diets between the plat-\nforms(47). An interesting study that has examined dietary\npreferences has found a difference in the urinary and\nplasma metabolite profile of subjects classified as either\n\u2018chocolate desiring\u2019 or \u2018chocolate indifferent\u2019 even before\nany food intake, suggesting that dietary preference alone\ninfluences metabolic rate and gut flora activity(33).\nA number of studies have investigated microbial fermen-\ntation of polyphenol-rich extracts such as grape juice or\nwine extract and again have found the presence of hippuric\nacid and its derivatives as well as phenolic acids as major\ncontributors to sample classification(38,48,49). Interestingly,\nthe use of faeces as a sample has demonstrated changes to\ngut-flora fermentation induced by a wine extract(38). More\nrecently, metabolomic studies have investigated carbohy-\ndrate intake either during an oral glucose tolerance\ntest(50,51) or following consumption of energy drinks(52).\nThe former studies have identified various pathways sti-\nmulated during the insulin response to glucose, some of\nwhich have not previously been reported(50,51).\nMetabolomics has been used to investigate the influence\nof vitamin E supplementation (400 mg\/d, 4 weeks) on\nplasma metabolite profiles of twelve healthy men using\nLC\u2013MS (JK Lodge and MC Wong, unpublished results).\nWhile principal component analysis has failed to demon-\nstrate discrimination of samples, a validated partial least\nsquares discriminant analysis model has been able to dis-\ncriminate samples pre- and post supplementation. Further\ninvestigation of loadings plots has revealed several features\nfor further investigation that have been confirmed to be\nsignificantly different pre- and post supplementation\n(P<0.05). Preliminary identification of these features has\nrevealed a number of lysophospholipids that are sig-\nnificantly increased following vitamin E supplementation\n(P<0.05). Although the confirmation of these species is\nstill ongoing, this finding highlights the potential of the\ntechnology in being able to identify changes to the meta-\nbolome and the identification of novel areas of research\nthat may go unnoticed using conventional techniques.\nFuture perspectives for nutritional metabolomics\nAlthough the potential of metabolomics is without\nquestion, the technology is still faced with a number of\nlimitations and challenges. There is no single platform\nthat can analyse all metabolites in a biological sample and\nso the limitations of each technology have to be taken into\naccount in experimental design. Obviously, a combination\nof NMR, LC\u2013MS and GC\u2013MS would be ideal to provide\na more holistic measure of the metabolome, but this\napproach itself brings important cost implications and an\nincrease in data analysis and complexity. There is currently\nno standardisation in terms of the methodology associated\nwith sample collection, sample pretreatment and analytical\nconditions. However, there have been recommendations\npublished to standardise metabolomic investigations and\ntheir reporting(53,54), which will hopefully influence future\ninvestigations. A major challenge is the influence of both\nanalytical and biological variability. Analytical variability\nshould improve with the advancement of technology and\nstandardisation of methodology, while the influence of\nbiological variability requires careful understanding of the\ninfluence of a variety of factors such as gender, BMI, age,\nrecent dietary intake, gut microflora and general health, as\nthese factors have all been shown to influence the meta-\nbolome. Furthermore, the influence of lifestyle, genetic and\nenvironmental factors, which are important in the aetiology\nof chronic disease, need to be further explored. Such con-\nsiderations have implications for study design to create a\nrelatively homogenous study population to reduce the\ninfluence of biological variation.\nAnother major challenge faced is the identification of\nmetabolites. Although a number of databases are available\nfor most platforms (and should be used in conjunction with\neach other), as the whole metabolome is not yet fully\ncharacterised there will always be a problem with the\nidentification of \u2018unknowns\u2019. Although useful structural\ninformation can be gained from further MS experiments\n(e.g. fragmentation), identification ultimately requires the\nuse of standards, and if not commercially available the\nassistance of synthetic chemists.\nThe future potential of this technology for nutritional\nresearch can be envisaged at various levels. It will be\npossible to integrate metabolomics with other \u2018omic\u2019\ntechnologies to provide a more complete picture of the\nmetabolic phenotype. The identification of those metabo-\nlites influenced by certain nutrients and\/or dietary patterns\ncan be useful for predictive analysis with the possibility of\nusing fluxomics (dynamic changes of metabolites within a\ncell over time) to investigate the flow of metabolites\nthrough metabolic pathways, especially now, as human\nmetabolic networks have been constructed(55). A well-\nestablished role for nutritional metabolomics has been\nidentified in the development of the nutritional phenotype\nand for future personalised nutritional assessment(1,3,4,9). It\nis thought that metabolomics can be used to predict the\nresponse of the metabolome to nutrient or dietary inter-\nvention and to predict dietary change required to modify\nthe metabolome to a \u2018healthy\u2019 phenotype. Although per-\nsonalised nutrition is a long way off, metabolomics does\noffer the possibility of characterising the complex interac-\ntions between diet and the metabolome.\nTargeted approaches\nTargeted approaches are more hypothesis testing and\ninclude those in which the nutrient(s) or metabolite(s) of\ninterest are known and information on concentration,\nMetabolite profiling in nutritional research 99\nP\nro\nce\ned\nin\ngs\no\nf\nth\ne\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nSo\nci\net\ny\nbioavailability, turnover or metabolism are required. These\napproaches can also be seen as a natural progression from\nnon-targeted approaches that are used in the first instance\nto identify novel targets for such further studies. Targeted\nanalysis can cover either single nutrients or metabolites or\nan analysis of metabolome subsets including lipids(56),\namino acids(57) and central metabolism(50). Indeed, the\nprofiling of lipids has developed into its own field of lipi-\ndomics and recent studies in this field, which include the\nanalysis of eicosanoid metabolism and signalling(58),\nidentifying lipids linked to inflammation following fish oil\nintervention(59), phospholipid metabolism(60), monitoring\nof lipid fluxes using stable isotopes(61) and evaluating dif-\nferential effects of statins(62), demonstrate how this parti-\ncular field is rapidly progressing.\nSimply measuring concentration alone provides only\nlimited information; therefore, in order to gain further\nunderstanding of the physiology of a nutrient or metabolite\nother approaches are required. A commonly-used method\nis to employ a stable-isotope analogue of the target, which\nas it should behave identically to the parent compound\nallows the monitoring of that specific form in the body\nfollowing ingestion, providing information on absorption,\nbioavailability, distribution, turnover, metabolism and\nelimination(63,64). The use of stable isotopes in nutritional\nresearch is extensive and a review of potential applications\nis beyond the scope of the present report, but there are\nseveral reviews that provide a starting point(64\u201367).\nAs an example of the benefits of using stable isotopes\nthis approach has been employed to monitor vitamin E\nstatus in various populations using 2H-labelled a-\ntocopheryl acetate(68). Vitamin E transport and delivery\nwithin the body is governed by the kinetics of plasma\nlipoprotein metabolism and much of what is now known\nabout vitamin E transport and distribution has been eluci-\ndated using stable-isotope approaches. Intestinal absorption\nrequires the presence of adequate fat, and significant dif-\nferences have been demonstrated in the plasma uptake of\nlabelled a-tocopherol between meals containing 2.7 g fat\nand 17.5 g fat (P<0.001)(69). It has been shown that during\nthe absorptive phase there is no discrimination between\nvitamin E forms(70), but a number of biokinetic studies have\ndemonstrated the preferential secretion of a-tocopherol in\nVLDL over other vitamin E forms(70), so that there is a\nretention of a-tocopherol in the body(71). The monitoring\nof labelled a-tocopherol in lipoproteins demonstrates that\na-tocopherol transport is dependent on lipoprotein kinet-\nics(72), with peaks in a-tocopherol concentration coincid-\ning with lipoprotein dynamics. Overall, following plasma\nuptake of newly-absorbed a-tocopherol there is a simulta-\nneous decrease in pre-existing or endogenous a-tocopherol\nconcentration. This rapid turnover of a-tocopherol in the\nplasma such that the \u2018new\u2019 constantly replaces the \u2018old\u2019 is\nan established phenomenon identified by stable-isotope\ntechniques(72,73) and also occurs within individual lipo-\nproteins(72). A similar phenomenon has been found in\nblood components, with different patterns of uptake in\nerythrocytes, platelets and lymphocytes(72) representative\nof simple diffusion or a more-regulated receptor-mediated\nuptake. Following an understanding of nutrient physiology\nin a healthy population a comparison can be made with\nhigh-risk populations to provide clues as to how nutrient\nphysiology is influenced. Using stable isotopes differences\nhave been found in a-tocopherol biokinetics between\nindividuals who are normolipidaemic and hyperlipi-\ndaemic(74), between smokers and non-smokers(75) and\nbetween individuals with the apoE3\/3 and apoE3\/4\nalleles(76). Overall, these studies highlight that vitamin E\nhomeostasis is ultimately dependent on a combination of\nfactors that control its absorption, transport, distribution\nand metabolism and that, translated to the field of nutri-\ntional research, approaches using stable-isotopes are\nessential to monitor nutrient status in vivo and their role in\nthe aetiology of disease.\nConclusions\nWith the combined array of targeted and non-targeted\napproaches it is now possible to not only identify metabo-\nlites and nutrients that are influenced by dietary change but\nto also gain a greater understanding of nutrient and meta-\nbolite physiology. Both approaches have proved successful\nin a number of applications and used either alone or in\nconjunction with one another they represent powerful\nresearch methods with the potential of opening novel areas\nof nutritional research and understanding the role of diet in\nhealth and disease.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank the British Heart Foundation,\nBASF AG and the University of Surrey Pump Priming for\nfunding parts of this work.
