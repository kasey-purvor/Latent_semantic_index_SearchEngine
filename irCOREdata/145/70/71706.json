Even countries with relatively well developed palliative care systems are\nconsidered to have problems of access and inequity of provision. Despite these concerns,\nwe still lack a relevant evidence base to serve as a guide to action. We present an analysis\nof access to adult hospice inpatient provision in the north-west region of England that\nemploys Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

Further, the use of\ndeprivation scores permits an analysis of the equity of access to adult inpatient hospice\ncare, leading to the identification of areas where additional service provision may be\nwarranted. Our research is subject to a number of caveats - it is limited to inpatient hospice\nprovision and does not include other kinds of inpatient and community-based palliative care\nservices. Likewise, we recognise that not everyone with cancer will require palliative\ncare and also that palliative care needs exist among those with nonmalignant conditions.\nNevertheless, our methodology is one that can also be applied more generally. Palliative\nMedicine 2004; 18: 543-549\nKey words: accessibility; deprivation; equity; geographical information systems; hospice inpatient\nservices\nIntroduction\nIt is well known that in many countries the development\nof hospice and palliative care services has been the\nproduct of opportunistic and unregulated forces, often\ndriven by charismatic leaders and enthusiastic 'product\nchampions'.' Because the work of palliative care touches\non questions of human mortality that are common to all\nindividuals, it has even been suggested that its growth has\nbeen the product of 'emotional planning'.2 The particular\nhistory of palliative care in the UK has made it the\nparadigm case for such interpretations, and guidance\nissued in 2002 by the UK government states: 'Access to\nand availability of specialist palliative care services is\nvariable and inequitable throughout the country'.3 As\npalliative care services in the UK reach a level of maturity\nthere is increasing attention on the part of policy makers\nto questions of equity of access. The issue was first raised\nin the early 1980s,4 but has recently become a more\nsalient feature of discussions relating to palliative care\nfunding. In 2002 the UK Department of Health\nannounced a new \u00a350 million investment in palliative\ncare services and made it clear that 'Ensuring this\nadditional funding reaches the services for which it is\nintended will mean a fairer deal for hospices and address\nAddress for correspondence: AC Gatrell, Institute for Health\nResearch, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB, UK.\nE-mail: a.gatrelllancaster.ac.uk\n\u00a9 Arnold 2004\ninequalities in access to the full range of palliative care\nservices'.5 The debate about access revolves around\ncertain key questions: can services of equal quality be\nutilised by all who may need them, regardless of\ndiagnosis; can services be accessed equally, regardless of\nage, social class, gender, or ethnic grouping; and are\nservices equally accessible, regardless of geographic\nlocation? The issue of access is at the forefront of policy\nmaking in palliative care. Yet despite such political\nrhetoric, we remain remarkably ignorant about one key\ndimension of the 'access' issue: the spatial distribution of\npalliative care services and the populations they serve. It\nis an issue that has been highlighted in recent policy\ndebates in the UK, but will nevertheless be recognized\nas a matter of importance in many other countries,\nespecially as the level of palliative care provision\nincreases.\nHere we examine current provision and access to\nhospice inpatient beds in the north-west region of\nEngland, though our approach is widely applicable in\nother settings. We assess the extent to which those living\nin particular small areas (electoral wards) have equity of\naccess to adult inpatient hospice services. We also seek to\ndemonstrate how a measure of potential accessibility to\nsuch services can be obtained, and go on to identify areas\nthat are relatively poorly served and relatively deprived.\nAccess using straight-line distance between different\nhealthcare sites and location of demand can be under-\n10.1 191\/0269216304pm892oa\n \u00a9 2004 SAGE Publications.

Analysis using estimated drive\ntimes, though perhaps of greater utility, is more compli-\ncated. We therefore consider briefly whether the use of\ndifferent measures of access to hospice services produces\nmarkedly different results in identifying groupings of\nwards with greater 'health needs', in this case the need for\nadult inpatient hospice care. We seek to offer both a\nmethodology and an empirical contribution to shed light\non current debates about access to hospice care.\nIn the UK, over 96% of hospice patients have a\ndiagnosis of cancer.6 The National Health Service\n(NHS) Cancer Plan7 highlights how more than one in\nthree people in England will develop cancer at some stage\nin their lives and that one in four will die of the disease.\nEach year in England, over 200 000 individuals are\ndiagnosed with cancer and it is the cause of around\n120000 deaths. Recent guidance strongly implies that\nmost of these will benefit from some form of palliative\nand supportive care and that a 'significant proportion of\npeople with advanced cancer suffer from a range of\ncomplex problems - physical, psychological, social and\nspiritual - which cannot always be dealt with effectively\nby generalist services in hospitals or the community'.3\nMany of these will receive care in hospices and it is\ntherefore appropriate to ask whether such services are\ndistributed equitably across the country.\nAccessibility to health services, and the equity of\nhealthcare provision, has been of concern to health\nservice managers and geographers for some years\nnow.8-12 There is a growing use of Geographical\nInformation Systems (GIS) to undertake analyses of the\nrelative accessibility of health services and we draw upon\nthese methods in the work reported below.\nMethods and data\nOur study setting is the north-west of England, a region\ncomprising the major conurbations of Manchester and\nMerseyside, former industrial areas of Lancashire, and\nlarge rural areas (parts of Lancashire and much of\nCumbria). Administratively, there are five counties\n(Cheshire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Lancashire\nand Cumbria). Counties, and districts within counties,\nare subdivided into small areas called electoral wards, the\nsmallest unit of local government in Britain.\nThere are 1019 census wards within the north-west\nregion (which, historically within the National Health\nService, includes a small part of High Peak district in the\ncounty of Derbyshire). Population data for these wards\nwere obtained from the most recent National Health\nService (NHS) Executive North West Small Area data-\nbase 2000.13 Data comprised latest available population\nestimates, for 1991 census wards, in 5-year age bands; at\nthe time of the study, small-area data from the 2001\ncensus were not available.\nGiven that the vast majority of hospice in-patients have\na diagnosis of cancer, the expected number of people who\nare likely to die from cancer in a given year within a given\narea can be used as a reasonable proxy for hospice\ndemand. Adult hospice inpatient facilities are potentially\nopen to anyone with advanced malignant disease, though\nuptake may be influenced by clinical estimates of need in\nany individual case. Whilst not everyone with a diagnosis\nof cancer will die from their disease, and the survival\nrates for different cancers vary appreciably, age-specific\nmortality rates for all cancers, when applied to north-\nwest England populations, were used to derive a reason-\nable proxy for potential demand.\nThree year average age-specific death rates for all\ncancers, for all persons aged over one year, were obtained\nfrom the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators\n(CCHI) 2001.14 Adult demand for hospice inpatient beds\nwas derived for those aged 15 years and over, by linking\nage-specific cancer mortality rates to populations in\ngiven age bands. This analysis enabled the anticipated\ndemand for hospice beds to be estimated for the small\nareas (electoral wards). The CCHI three-year average\nmortality rates for 2000 indicate that 18 868 adults (aged\n15 years and over) died that year within the north-west\nfrom all cancers. The cancer death rates increase rapidly\nwith age, from 8.4 per 100000 persons aged 15-34, to\n178.6 between the age of 35 and 64, to 971.9 between the\nages of 65 and 74, and to 1690.5 aged over 75 years.\nElectoral wards in retirement areas have appreciably\nhigher proportions of older residents and, given increas-\ning cancer incidence with age, hospice provision is, other\nthings being equal, most likely to be required in such\nareas. However, whilst retirement areas (particularly in\nsome coastal areas) have relatively high proportions of\nolder people, they tend to be less heavily populated than\nmore urban areas in Manchester and Merseyside. When\nwe apply age-specific cancer incidence rates to ward\npopulations it is these urban areas that show the greatest\n'demand' for hospice services.\nSince we wish to assess the relationship between\ncurrent provision and access to levels of deprivation we\nrequire small-area data on the latter. A range of\nindicators has been developed in recent years to describe\nlevels of 'material deprivation', at the neighbourhood,\nlocal area, regional or national level. Widely used\nindicators include the Jarman, Townsend and Carstairs\nscores, which combine a range of 1991 census indicators\n(such as unemployment and lack of car ownership) to\nhighlight relative deprivation.15 More recently, these have\nbeen supplemented by the Index of Multiple Deprivation\n(IMD), which recognises different 'domains' of depriva-\ntion, including (for example) income, employment and\neducation. 16 Deprivation indices assign a numerical\n \u00a9 2004 SAGE Publications.

In general, depriva-\ntion indicators show a strong correlation with a variety of\nhealth outcomes. However, such indicators do not always\nmeasure exactly the same things. The Jarman Under-\nprivileged Area (UPA) Score was designed to measure the\nneed for primary care; Townsend and Carstairs are\nconsidered proxy value for levels of material wealth\/\npoverty. Here, we use Townsend scores, obtained from\nthe NHS Executive North West for all wards within our\nstudy area.\nWithin north-west England, 27 hospices provide adult\ninpatient care. Data on hospice sites and bed numbers\nwere obtained from the Hospice Information website, a\njoint venture between the national UK charity Help the\nHospices and St Christopher's Hospice, London.6 A\nfollow-up telephone call was made to each hospice to\nconfirm bed numbers. Whilst the majority of hospice bed\nnumbers were confirmed as being the same as published\nsummaries, in a small number of cases hospices reported\nlower bed numbers. In June 2002, north-west hospices\nprovided 380 adult inpatient beds (range 4-36).\nGrid references were obtained for the population\ncentres of all electoral wards. The postcode for each\nadult hospice was matched to a grid reference using\nStreetmap, a web-based gazetteer for matching postcodes\nto point locations (grid references). Straight-line dis-\ntances between hospices and ward centres were then\ncalculated. At a regional scale, the use of straight-line\ndistance may well be a reasonable proxy for measuring\naccess. However, it fails to take into account barriers to\nmovement, or transport routes. We therefore estimated\ntravel times between hospices and ward centres, using\ntypical national speed estimates for different classes of\nroad. We consider here the results using 'drive time'\nmeasurements, but compare these briefly with those\nbased on straight-line distance in order to highlight any\ndifferences between the two approaches.\nIn human geography and urban and regional planning,\n'gravity-type' models are frequently used to model access\nto services.9\"12 Essentially, these suggest that the like-\nlihood of travel to a site is directly related to its relative\nsize (or 'attractiveness') and inversely proportional to\nhow far away it is from the user. In the present study the\nrelative location (distance) component is quite straight-\nforward, but issues of attractiveness or 'size' are more\ncomplex. As a starting point we have measured this\nsimply on the basis of hospice bed numbers. We then\nconstruct an accessibility score for each small area\n(electoral ward) by taking (for each hospice) the number\nof beds divided by the distance from that hospice to the\nward, then summing these over all such hospices.\nA similar approach was used to measure access using\ndrive times between sites and wards. Time, as opposed to\ndistance was used as the denominator, with a maximum\ndrive time of 30 minutes used for analysis of access; in\nother words, hospices located more than 30 minutes from\na ward centre were discounted.\nThe analysis was conducted using a GIS. This is a\ncomputer-based information system with a geographical\ndimension.8-10,17,18 It stores, manipulates and analyses\nspatially-linked data and displays summary information\non a map. Apart from its ability to visualise health, and\nother, data on a map, thus adding locational context to\nanalysis, it enables the researcher to undertake analysis\nwhich other databases cannot readily perform, notably\nspatial analyses (for example, assessing how many people\nlive within a particular distance of a healthcare facility).\nWe used the desktop GIS 'MapInfo', in most of the work\nreported below.19\nResults\nAccessibility\nAccessibility scores for small areas, based on assumed\ndrive times, are shown in Figure 1, along with the\nlocations of hospices. Given the greater number of\nhospices in the Manchester conurbation and the relative\ndearth in Cheshire, north Lancashire, and Cumbria, it is\nunsurprising that those living around the Manchester\narea have greater potential accessibility.\n'Demand' and accessibility\nThe relationship between 'demand' and potential acces-\nsibility (Figure 2) reveals a generally positive relationship;\nthose wards with high expected demand tend to be those\nwhich are reasonably accessible to hospices. Of particular\ninterest, however, is the group of wards (highlighted in a\nbox) where demand is greater than the regional average,\nand accessibility is less than the regional average. Here,\nwe use the median as a measure of the average; the\nmedian expected demand for hospice beds was 16 adults\nper ward, while the median 'accessibility' score for\nhospice beds was 11.4. Based on drive time measurement,\nof the 139 wards where demand is greater than median\nvalues and access is below median values, adult demand\nequates to 3495 adults. In other words, there are about\n3500 adults likely to have cancer, who could thus benefit\nfrom inpatient hospice care at the later stage of their lives,\nand who are living in areas that are relatively inaccessible\nto one or more hospices.\n'Demand', accessibility, and deprivation\nWe now link areas of high demand and low supply to\ndata on material deprivation, a major determinant of\nhealth.

Pockets of\nhigh demand\/low access are apparent, although scattered\nacross the region. In particular, industrial Barrow-in-\nFurness in South Cumbria, the Wirral, Lytham, South-\nport, and some rural wards in the Ribble Valley of central\nLancashire, and some rural wards in South Cheshire\ndemonstrate poor access and high demand. However,\ntaking into account deprivation (and hence 'need') there\nis a case for further hospice provision in the Wirral area\nof Merseyside in particular.\nDiscussion\nWe have undertaken a preliminary analysis of inpatient\nhospice provision for adults in north-west England. We\nhave used a measure of potential demand for such care,\nbased on cancer mortality, together with a measure of\naccessibility to such services (based on bed numbers and\ntravel time estimates) and identified small areas within\nthe region that are both relatively inaccessible to services\nand which have above average 'demand' for services.\nFurther, we have identified a subset of these small areas,\nthose which are relatively deprived, which may merit a\nmore focused effort for additional inpatient palliative\ncare provision. Further adult hospice\/palliative care beds\ncould be provided for Barrow, Central Lancashire,\nCarlisle, South Cheshire, and the Wirral peninsula (see\nFigure 3 for locations).\nOur research is of a preliminary and speculative kind,\nsubject to several caveats and limitations. First, we have\nlooked only at inpatient hospice provision, and this is but\none aspect of what most hospices and specialist palliative\ncare services offer. We have not considered other forms of\n'support', including home care and day care, nor have we\nsaid anything about whether hospital support teams\nprovide adequate services in those areas we have identi-\nfied as being 'in need' of additional inpatient provision.\nConsequently, the 'supply side' needs considerable re-\nfinement if we are to offer an adequate picture of service\nprovision. Further studies using the methodology em-\nployed here against different inclusion criteria would\nenhance our understanding of the spatial distribution of\npalliative day care, home care services and outpatient\nclinics. Secondly, our representation of 'demand' is\noversimplified. We have applied age-specific rates for all\ncancers to small area population data, disaggregated by\nbroad age-band. Yet not everyone with cancer will\nrequire palliative care. Furthermore, although people\nwith advanced malignancies are the primary users of\nhospice services, there are other hospice patients whose\n'demands' are not accounted for here. Our findings are\nlimited to the likely demands from cancer patients, but\nagain, the methodology could be applied to other life-\nlimiting conditions.\nWe have used estimated travel times as a measure of\nspatial separation of hospices from the populations of\nsmall areas (aggregated to a single location, the ward\ncentre, at which the population is assumed to be located).\nThis offers a more realistic representation of such\nseparation than does simple straight-line distance, since\nthe geography of the study area, particularly in areas\nbordering the coast, means that straight-line distances\nare a poor substitute for transport networks. However,\ntravel time, or estimated drive time, assumes that every-\none has access to a private car and that people can travel\nat constant speeds on different road types. Road speeds\nvary depending on time of day, and accidents, road\nworks, weather conditions, and so on, are all complicat-\ning factors. No account is taken here of the possibilities\n \u00a9 2004 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Public\ntransport may be more of a factor for day care.\nWhen straight-line distance and drive time accessibility\nanalyses are compared we note that 103 wards (62%) are\nselected using either measure of spatial separation. The\nsame core groupings or clusters of wards exhibit inequi-\ntable access to hospice services arise whichever measure\nof 'distance' is used. Thus in many cases, particularly in\ninland areas, it may well be the case that a simpler\nstraight-line distance measure will suffice.\nGIS can be employed to analyse a wide range of\nhealthcare service locational issues. Our research has\npinpointed localised geographical inequity in hospice\nservice provision, which in turn contributes to the debate\non funding additional beds, staff, and other cancer\nservices. We suggest there is scope for further work in\nthis field. One obvious proposal is to consider a wider\nstudy area, perhaps across the whole country, to identify\n \u00a9 2004 SAGE Publications.

Also pressing is the need\nfor research on actual patterns of demand for hospice\ninpatient care. From what areas do hospices draw users\nof their services? Other work conducted by one of the\nauthors on 'place of death' of cancer patients in part of\nnorth-west England shows that there are clear proximity\neffects;21 those living close to a hospice are more likely to\ndie there than in other settings. Further, those with some\nforms of cancer (notably of the lymphatic system) are tied\nquite closely to hospital services and are more likely to\ndie in that setting. If adequate data were available on\nwhich population groups, with which cancers, were most\nlikely to use inpatient hospice services we could under-\ntake a more sophisticated representation of service\nutilisation, which might inform a better representation\nof demand. This requires the collection of data that we\ndo not believe to be presently available. Last, we need\nfurther understanding of the policies of hospice providers\ntowards their users; are catchment areas well defined or\nquite loosely based? What are the processes of referral\nfrom the primary and secondary health-care sectors?\nAnswers to these and other questions will permit a fuller\nanalysis of service provision in this key sector of the\nhealth-care system.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch has been conducted through funding from the\nNational Health Service Executive North West Public\nHealth Observatory.
