Recently, however, TV screens have been filled with images of \nglaciers melting at unprecedented rates, of extreme weather patterns that cause \nchaos to people and severe economic disruption, mounting evidence of secular \nclimatic change. Much of this reflects the enormous expansion of movement of \npeople and things around the world, transported by carbon-based modes of \ntransport that create vast quantities of greenhouse gases (27% of all CO2 \nemissions result form transport and this figure is still rising: Chapman, 2007). The \ngrowth of greenhouse gases is producing perhaps irreversible changes with \npotentially apocalyptic consequences to the ecological systems on which life on \nearth as we know it depends \u2013 and maybe sooner than we think, given the \nemergent properties of complex systems that we at best only partially \nunderstand. This recognition of human culpability is adding a new edge to \ndebates about sustainability and raising questions about the implications of \nenvironmental changes for lifestyle and livelihood, especially as the worst \nconsequences of such changes would impinge upon those people and places \nleast able to cope with them. There are, therefore, strong ethical and moral \ndimensions to these issues. \n \n 1\nMoreover, they have important implications for how we think about regional \ndevelopment and possible transitions to sustainable regions as a necessary \nelement in a transition to a more sustainable planet. Can those who live in the \ncore regions of the affluent global \u2018North\u2019, for example, continue to assume that \nrelying on the global movements of commodities and people from distant regions \nto sustain their lifestyles will continue to be possible? And if they can\u2019t, which \nseems likely, what are the implications of this for concepts and definitions of what \nconstitutes regional development (for example, see Pike et al, 2006, especially \nChapter 8)? What will the looming global crisis of sustainability entail for both the \ntheory and practice of regional development?  \n \nIn the last decade or so, concepts of regions and regional development have \nbeen re-worked as part of the narratives of a globalising economy, rooted in the \nregulatory policies and practices of neo-liberalism. The emphasis in development \ndiscourse, especially in the global \u2018North\u2019, has increasingly come to focus on the \nnotion of regions, and more latterly city regions , as key nodes in global networks \nof production and consumption and on their connections with other regions. For \nsome, regions have become the key territorial units in an era of globalisation (for \nexample, see Scott, 1998; Storper, 1995), although, arguably, the focus on the \nregion is being replaced by a revived interest in city-regions as the pivotal \nterritorial unit (see Scott and Storper, 2003; OECD, 2006). In either case, \nhowever, the emphasis is placed firmly upon endogenous growth processes, \nregional institutions and regionally-specific knowledges and learning, often \nexplicitly linked to the existence of clusters of related economic activities in a \nregion (for example, Porter 2000; 2003) \u2013 in short, on what has been termed the \nTerritorial Innovations Models perspective on regional development (Moulaert \nand Sekia, 2003). While the emphasis is upon the deployment of regional assets \nas the basis of regional economic success in a globalising economy, this success \nis predicated upon the location of these regions in wider global circuits of capital: \ninputs flow in from other regions, outputs are sold outside the region. This is \nregistered in the burgeoning literatures on global commodity chains, global value \n 2\nchains and global production networks (for example, see Coe et al, 2004; Gereffi \nand Korzeniewicz, 2004; Gereffi et al, 2005; Henderson et al, 2002; Hess and \nYeung, 2006; Smith et al, 2002). While there may be an emphasis upon building \n\u2018clusters\u2019 of activities within regions and so fostering the intra-regional \ncohesiveness of economies, this is seen as a way of enhancing global \ncompetitiveness and the ability to sell commodities made in a region in global \nmarkets.  \n \nFor many regions in the global \u2018South\u2019, however, \u2018development\u2019 has been defined \nin much less sophisticated terms, with strong echoes of a colonial past. For \nsome, it has involved restructuring agricultural production systems away from \nsubsistence to cash-crop production, from production for domestic consumption \nto producing a range of \u2018exotic\u2019 fruits, vegetables and flowers for sale in the \nmarkets of the \u2018North\u2019. For others, the emphasis has been upon becoming \nregions of export-oriented manufacturing of a range of consumer goods, typically \ntied into the supply chains of global brand owners based in the \u2018North\u2019, via the \nattraction of foreign direct investment. Such changes have typically been made in \nthe context of external pressures, such as those of the World Bank\u2019s structural \nadjustment programmes. One consequence of this has been to raise a range of \nethical and moral concerns about the re-orientation of production to export \nmarkets, about  issues of health and safety at work and working conditions, the \nemployment of child labour and so on, both among consumers in the \u2018North\u2019 and \nacademic commentators (for example, Hughes, 2004; 2006; Jackson, 2002).  \n \nIn summary, the policy focus in the peripheral \u2018losing\u2019 regions in both \u2018North\u2019 and \n\u2018South\u2019, those unfavourably positioned in such chains or networks, has shifted \nmarkedly. Such regions have sought in one way or another to re-position \nthemselves more favourably in global circuits of capital, commodity movements \nand flows of value as the route to socio-economic well-being and development, \noften seeking explicitly to emulate the \u2018winning\u2019 regions. Regional development \nbecame de facto defined as successful re-positioning; to fail to do so was to \n 3\nremain rooted at the bottom of the various chains or in the peripheries of \nnetworks. Successful regional development therefore involved the \nencouragement of a variety of flows (of commodities, money and people) into \nregions, processes of transformation and value-adding within those regions, and \nthen subsequent sale and the flows of the resultant commodities out of regions, \ncreating flows between regions scattered around the world with little or no regard \nfor the ecological costs or, often, for the ethical consequences of so doing. \nContinuing with a mode of development that is predicated on encouraging global \nflows between regions widely dispersed around the world is increasingly \nproblematic.  \n \nIn contrast to this conception of development, might we not be forced to think \nseriously about returning to more localised and regionalised ways of living, \npredicated on a different conception of what constitutes development \u2013 because \nnot to do so may well contribute in a major way to endangering life as we know it \non the planet? If this needs to be done, how might it be done? Clearly a return to \nthe closed regional world of the pays beloved by Paul Vidal de la Blache (1941) \nis not a feasible option. But what possibilities are there for moving onto \ndevelopment trajectories that aim to maximise intra-regional movement and \ncohesion and enhance the eco-efficiency of the processes of production, \nexchange and consumption that are constitutive of regional economies?   \n \nRegionalising economies: regions as sustainable economic spaces \n \nThere is potential to regionalise production activities in ways that enhance \neconomic efficiency as well as reducing the ecological footprint of production, by \nminimising both wastes and the costs of moving materials between production \nprocesses and facilities. Consider the example of the Kalundborg eco-industrial \npark in Denmark, typically seen as a pre-eminent example of successful eco-\nindustrial development (EID) (for other examples, see Cornell University, 2002; \nScharb, 2001; Stone, 2002). Five industrial companies collaborate for mutual \n 4\neconomic and environmental benefit, closing material loops via exchanging \ndifferent kinds of by-product, based on bi-lateral commercial agreements \u201cbuilt \nwith economics in mind: the exchanges are not altruistic \u2013 they are driven by real \nprofit incentives and the increased need for risk management\u201d (Ferri and Cefola, \n2002, 36). In this way, they convert by-products that might otherwise have been \ndeposited in the environment as polluting wastes into valuable inputs into the \nproduction processes of adjacent companies. This has led to substantial cost \nsaving and improved environmental performance, which confer a cost advantage \nfor participating companies as well as delivering substantial environmental \nbenefits.  \n \nIts proponents claim that EID is different, grounded in a biological analogy that \n\u201cmimics the adaptive characteristics observed in nature by creating inter-firm \nrelationships based on exchange and mutual gain\u201d. Consequently, firms that \npractice EID successfully emulate nature\u2019s adaptive processes and adjust their \nbehaviour accordingly (Ferri and Cefola, 2002, 34-8). First, they take a holistic \nview of their economic environment and identify potential network partners. \nSecondly, they find interdependencies and engage in various resource \nexchanges. As well closing materials loops via re-cycling, recovery or re-use of \nwastes and enhancing eco-efficiency, EID offers strategies to achieve greater \nefficiency through economies of systems integration in which partnerships \nbetween businesses meet common services, transportation and infrastructure \nneeds. Thirdly, they take advantage of exchanges to discover new products and \nprocess, suggesting that companies seeking eco-efficiency gains may become \nimportant spaces of innovation, knowledge creation and learning. Moreover, \nbenefits spill over to local communities via environmental improvements, \nincreased employment and more co-operative industrial relations. The emphasis \nis firmly upon EID creating win-win scenarios within regions. \n \nThe most feasible locations for successful eco-industrial developments are big \ndensely populated regions, which best meet the three conditions seen as \n 5\nnecessary for such developments to be successful. First, there is an approximate \nbalance between the demand for and supply of by-products, and therefore \nsufficient compatibility between firms within close proximity to ensure stable \nquantities and qualities of such by-products. Secondly, inter-firm relationships \nbased upon close individual connections or within an institutional framework that \nreduces transaction costs. Thirdly, regulatory regimes that encourage \ncollaborative inter-firm relationships rather than the disposing of by-products as \nwastes. Recognition of such issues is not new, however. Several decades ago \nTalbot identified the key issue as follows: \u201cwaste must be forthcoming in a steady \nstream of uniform volume to justify its exploitation, and the fashioning of these \nstreams is the supreme difficulty\u201d (Talbot, 1920, cited in Scharb, 2001, 22). \n \nThere are also other tensions associated with implementing EID. EID parks \n\u201caspire to zero emission or closed loop manufacturing\u201d and \u201cthe total elimination \nof wastes\u201d via exchanges of inputs and outputs (Spohn, 2002, 1). This has the \nadded advantage of minimising the movement and transport of materials \nexchanged between companies. However, the emphasis on fostering networks \namong businesses and communities to optimise resource use and reduce \neconomic and environmental costs has led to increasing recognition of the need \nto look at broader regional scales to ensure economies of scale and sufficient \nsupply of exchange materials (Scharb, 2001, 1-2, 13). Consequently, firms \ninvolved in EID \u201cnetwork with other complementary firms within a particular \nregion\u201d (Ferri and Cefola, 2002, 35). EID clearly demonstrates the capacity to \nreduce wastes and the intra-regional movement of materials in the process of \nmanufacturing by regionalising at least part of supply chains. It is, however, \nimportant to remember that there are limits to EID in that raw materials are \ntypically imported into the region and finished products sold outside the region. \n \nThere are other ways of regionalising economic activities that can lead to a \ngreater degree of regional closure of economies. Consider, for example, the \nregionalisation of food supply chains that has taken place over much of the \n 6\nEuropean Union, in part as a consequence of seeking to encourage healthier \ndiets and greater consumption of fresh, locally produced, in part organic, \nfoodstuffs (for an example see Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2007). Such \ndevelopments lead to more nutritious diets and so help reduce diet-related health \nproblems such as cancers, diabetes, heart disease and obesity, while also \ncreating markets to sustain regional agriculture. Furthermore, such developments \ncan substantially reduce the ecological footprint of agriculture by reducing \u2018food \nmiles\u2019 and CO2 emissions as supply chains shorten and tonne-miles of food \nmoved fall. Regionalisation of production and consumption does not \nautomatically translate into a lower environmental footprint, however. For \nexample, producing tomatoes in heated greenhouses in the UK may result in a \ngreater carbon footprint than producing them out of doors in Spain and then \ntransporting them to the UK for sale, emphasising the need for a full Life Cycle \nAnalysis (see Hudson, 2001, 287-94). \n \nIt has also been claimed that agriculture could be made ecologically more \nefficient via food production \u2018factories\u2019 located in or near city-regions and\/or \ndensely populated regions. Such developments would lower transport and \nstorage costs, enable a closer harmonisation of supply and demand and allow \ninformation about local needs and preferences (tastes, lifestyles etc) to be better \nintegrated into the production process.  Because production in controlled facilities \nwould serve a known and defined regional population, feedback loops could be \nincorporated to allow just-in-time production, with ICT links between production \nunits and retail outlets enabling supply and demand to be dovetailed in terms of \nvariety, quality, quantity and timing (and in fact such supply chain management is \nalready virtually ubiquitous among major food retailers). Creating precisely \ncontrolled localised growing environments would allow detailed specification of \nproduct characteristics and only foods that met specified consumer requirements \nwould be produced. Such a system could yield major eco-efficiency gains, \nreducing fossil energy needs to almost zero, CO2 inputs by a factor of 8 and \n 7\nwater use by a factor of 18, and so substantially lowering the environmental \nfootprint of agriculture (Weaver et al, 2000, 113-6). \n \nThere is, therefore, considerable scope for more eco-efficient regionalised \nproduction and distribution of food. There is also potential for further eco-\nefficiency gains and the creation of more sustainable regions but realising this \nwill require more generalised changes in food production systems and more \ngeneral societal changes in diet, food preferences and tastes. Consumption of \nmeat contributes significantly to the environmental impacts of agriculture. \nIndustrial meat production from grain-fed livestock is an environmentally polluting \nand ecologically inefficient method of producing edible energy and protein, with \nthe loss of 80-90% of the contained nutritional value of the feedstock (Lapp\u00e9, \n1991).  Furthermore, the consumption of meat is heavily skewed towards more \naffluent regions of the globe, in which its consumption is both culturally \nsanctioned and affordable. For the two thirds of the global population who have a \npredominantly vegetarian diet, meat is an unaffordable luxury, even if it is \nculturally sanctioned. \n \nThis example of dietary variation and potential dietary change highlights the \ncomplexities of seeking to shift to more sustainable economic practices within a \ngiven region. Intra-regional change alone may be a necessary but not sufficient \ncondition for regional transition. Novel foods could enable protein to be produced \nwith much lower environmental impacts (with improvements in resource \nproductivity in the order of 20 or 30) and at substantially lower economic cost. \nThere are, however, major cultural, economic and social barriers to their \nadoption. Foods not only meet nutritional needs but also provide satisfaction for \nconsumers through their aromas, flavours and textures. Moreover, \u201cthey also say \nsomething about us. Foods are used both to confer and confirm social standing. \nImportant relationships and family occasions are marked by eating important \nfoods\u201d. As a result, \u201call in all, the concerns of consumers over conventional foods \nin eating norms and habits constitute significant barriers to dietary change\u201d \n 8\n(Weaver et al, 2000, 121-2). So too do major capitalist concerns and agri-\nbusinesses with vested interests in reproducing existing food production and \ndistribution systems on which their profits depend. Consequently, there are \nconsiderable pressures militating against innovative and potentially more eco-\nefficient food products.  \n \nBig city-regions and densely-populated regions also have potential to become \nmore sustainable spaces of consumption in other ways. This can be exemplified \nwith reference to cleaning and washing clothing and other household textiles. \nCurrently, many households in more affluent regions of the world perform these \ntasks in the house, using automatic washing machines and tumble driers. Such \nappliances are major consumer durables for many households and a source of \nprofits for companies that produce them. These activities also have a heavy \necological footprint: they account for about 20% of household water and energy \nuse in the Netherlands, for example (Weaver et al, 2000, 176).  This partly \nreflects the way in which washing has symbolic and ritualistic, as well as \nfunctional, dimensions. Alternative laundering techniques with the potential to \nclean household textiles are inappropriate for use at the scale of the household. \nThe eco-efficiency benefits that they can potentially yield in part depend upon up-\nscaling to more collective, regionalised provision. Assuming that cultural \npressures for home-based systems could be overcome, the resultant scale \neconomies would yield short-to-medium term eco-efficiency gains from \nrecovering and re-using energy and materials and from matching cleaning \ntreatment to need, reducing the resources used in the process per unit of \nlaundry. Energy efficiencies in cleaning would need to be offset against the \nenergy costs of delivering and collecting laundry within the region, but the net \nresult would still be a reduction. \n \n \nRegions as spaces of sustainable mobility and movement \n \n 9\nConstructing sustainable regions will also require radical shifts in transport \ntechnologies and, over the longer-term, land use patterns. There is an intimate \nlink between automobility (Urry, 1999) and lifestyle for many people, for whom \nmobility is an important element of their quality of life. In turn, this reflects the \nlong-established and well-known power of the \u201croad lobby\u201d (Hamer, 1974) to \npromote its interests around the manufacture of cars and the construction of \nroads and other infrastructure on which to drive them. Thus land use patterns, \ntransport demand and transport supply arrangements have co-evolved so that \nthe capacity to be highly mobile and the demand for mobility have been mutually \nsupportive. Reduction of the resultant environmental impacts could be achieved \nvia some combination of demand management, more efficient methods of \nallocating people and goods to different modes of transport, changing modal \nsplits and, in the longer term, technological change to produce more energy-\neffective modes of movement and enable \u201cdecarbonization of the economy\u201d, \nsomething that \u201cis clearly of paramount importance\u201d (Wernick et. al., 1997, 138). \nSuch changes would also have the beneficial effect of helping address  \ninequalities in mobility that have resulted from prioritisation of the private car as a \nmode of transport over much of the world.  \n \nFor many people, then, constructing regions as sustainable spaces of \nconsumption, movement and production within a decarbonising economy will \nrequire radically changing lifestyles as journeys to work, to shop, and for \npurposes of recreation are re-shaped and reduced in distance and people travel \nmuch more on foot, by bicycle or by various modes of public transport. For this to \nbe possible, any meaningful longer term transition to sustainability will require \nmajor changes to the spatial arrangement of built environments, the relative \nlocations of spaces of work, exchange, leisure, and residences and \ncommensurate changes in peoples\u2019 activity patterns,  spaces and dominant \nmodes of travel. In brief, it will require a shift from built environments designed to \nmaximise the movements required to go to work, shop and play to environments \ndesigned to minimise such movements within regions. Planning and designing \n 10\nbuilt environments to minimise movement will drastically alter the relative \nlocations of spaces of dwelling, work and so on and also the scales at which \nthese activities occur. There may well be resistance to such changes, even \nthough innovations in ICTs, such as the Internet, make them a feasible option. \nFor example, recent research in Finland reveals that telework has only led to a \n0.7% reduction in total commuting kilometres travelled (Helminen and Risitim\u00e4ki, \n2007). Button and Taylor (2001, 30) note that such technological developments \noffer the potential to replace large-scale vehicle commuting by virtual offices in \nthe home but also cite surveys of commuters in California, which reveal that only \n2% wanted a zero to two minute commute while almost 50% preferred a \ncommute of 30 minutes or more, suggesting resistance to the erosion of \nautomobile-based lifestyles and the spatial separation of workplace and home. It \nwould also be dangerous to underestimate the inertia built into built environments \nprecisely because they are constituted via major outlays of fixed capital (both \nprivate and public sector investment), typically amortised or depreciated over \ndecades. There are powerful economic imperatives to preserve existing socio-\nspatial structures, or at least slow the pace of change so that it does not \nendanger existing fixed capital investments and steer it so that it provides further \nscope for capital accumulation. It is an open question as to whether these \neconomic imperatives are compatible with equally strong socio-ecological \nimperatives to shift to more sustainable forms of human activity. \n \n \nRegions as spaces of waste disposal and re-cycling \n \nWhile EID and related forms of development provide a means of dealing \nproductively with some forms of wastes produced within regions, many regions \nsimply export their environmental pollutants. For example, pollutants from coal \nfired power stations can be exported in molecular form via emissions from high \nchimney stacks. The expansion of international air and sea travel has resulted in \nsignificant emissions of pollutants into the largely unregulated global commons of \n 11\nthe atmosphere and oceans, with adverse environmental effects (German \nAdvisory Council on Global Change, 2002). In other cases, waste products are \nexported in different forms, with a deliberate targeting of destination regions, \noften in the periphery of the global economy. For example, Yearley (1995) \nreported that Kassa Island, off the coast of Africa, became the recipient of highly-\npolluted incinerator ash from power stations in Philadelphia. Over a decade later, \nHouveld (2006) reported that a Greek-registered ship, chartered by a Dutch \ncompany, had discharged several hundred tons of highly toxic wastes, a \npoisonous mix of petrol wastes and cleaning agents, from its tanks at Abidjan, in \nthe Ivory Coast. The sludge was then taken away by a local company, and \ndumped at ten sites around Abidjan. This led to thousands of people being \nhospitalised and several deaths.  \n \nIn summary, as people in more economically developed countries came to \nunderstand the dangers posed by noxious pollutants, environmental standards \nwere increased and it became more difficult to secure regions within those \ncountries in which hazardous wastes could be deposited, pressures rose to find \nother ways of dealing with such pollutants. Exporting them was often cheaper \nthan dealing with them at home, as this could involve considerable financial costs \nbut, perhaps more significantly, political costs, in the face of NIMBYism (\u201cnot in \nmy back yard\u201d) and opposition by residents to wastes being treated in \u201ctheir \nregion\u201d. However, local communities have differential capacity \u2013 indeed \nwillingness - to resist, as Zonafeld demonstrated in her analysis of the French \nnuclear industry on the La Hague peninsula (Zonafeld, 1993). In the UK, nuclear \nwaste has been re-processed at Sellafield, Cumbria, for some fifty years, with \npersistent worries as to the effects of accidents and the exposure of workers and \nlocal residents to radiation.  Sellafield is located in a peripheral region, however, \nwith few other employment opportunities. Moreover, \u201cone of the best predictors of \nthe location of toxic waste dumps in the United States is a geographical \nconcentration of people of low income and color\u201d (Harvey, 1996, 368). Indeed, \npoorer regions within the global North and peripheral states within the South \n 12\nhave engaged in bidding wars, seeking to become destinations for hazardous \nwastes in return for monetary payments and incomes. Increasing environmental \nstandards have also led to new forms of inter-regional global trade in wastes. \nThe activity of picking through waste to sort and re-cycle is labour intensive, \npoorly paid and of low social esteem. As such, it is exported to peripheral \nunderdeveloped regions of the global economy \u2013 and justified as creating \nemployment there.  \n \nAlthough international regulatory and trade agreements have halted the worst \nexcesses of the trade in noxious wastes, the global \u2018North\u2019 still offloads its wastes \nonto the peripheries as wastes are shipped from Europe to China and Indonesia \nfor sorting and re-use while ships are driven onto beaches in Bangladesh and \nIndia to be taken apart and their constitutive material re-cycled (for example, see \nBuerk, 2006). The international trade in pollutants is complex, however, and \nthere are also flows among regions in core countries. For example, in the first \nyears of the present century, derelict and heavily polluted USA navy \u201cghost \nships\u201d were moved to Hartlepool in north east England for dismantling, although \nthis activity has yet to commence because the local planning authority refuses to \ngrant planning permission. In the 1990s Japanese nuclear waste was shipped to \nSellafield in the UK for re-processing before being returned to Japan.1 Export of \nwastes can be problematic for exporters, however, as the impacts of pollution \nreturn to blight their origin regions. For example, factories re-located from the \nUSA into the maquiladora border zone in Mexico in response, inter alia, to less \nstringent environmental regulations there subsequently exported air pollution, \nsewage and contaminated food back to the USA as \u201cecological havoc recognises \nno boundaries\u201d (George, 1992, 6). This exemplifies a broader point: that in the \nfinal analysis, much of the pollutant effects of contemporary economic activity are \nneither simply regional nor regionalisable. They cannot be contained via spatial \n                                                 \n1 These issues of the production of, international trade in, and re-use of wastes are being \ninvestigated in a major and research project funded by the UK Economic and Social Research \nCouncil, involving anthropologists, geographers and engineers in the Universities of Durham and \nSheffield, in University College London and in Goldsmiths College, London.

Sustainable regions and the \ncontradictions of capital \n \nFor some time now, there has been a strong emphasis in mainstream \ndevelopment discourse and policy on positioning regions more favourably in \nglobal commodity and value chains and global production networks, up-grading \ntheir position in terms of links with other regions and locations. So economic \ndevelopment and \u2018success\u2019 were seen as integrally linked to creating connections \nwith and flows to other regions, maximising inter-regional flows, often on a global \nscale.  Now there is an increasingly strong imperative to move towards more self-\ncontained and sustainable models of regional development, maximising intra-\nregional flows and connections (in part to help close materials loops) in terms of \nenvironmentally less damaging processes of production, exchange and \nconsumption. It is, however, unrealistic to expect complete closure \u2013 or that all \nregions can be self-sufficient. Consequently, this raises important questions as to \nthe extent to which regional \u2018closure\u2019 is possible and the effects of such partial \nclosure on the lifestyles and livelihoods of people who live and work in particular \nregions, in both the \u2018North\u2019 and \u2018South\u2019.  \n \nThis has particularly important implications, however, for those marginalised \nregions in the \u2018South\u2019 that have embarked - often with little choice \u2013 on \n\u2018development\u2019 strategies based upon transforming local economies to find a \nniche in global production systems, whether in agriculture (a range of exotic fruits \nand vegetables, cut flowers) or as Free Production Zones for export-oriented \nmanufacturing. While the ethical concerns and pressures from \u2018Northern\u2019 \nconsumer groups and NGOs for \u2018fair trade\u2019 and better working conditions for \nfactory workers (banning child labour, regulating terms, conditions and hours of \n 14\nwork, improving health and safety etc) are laudable and important, it is also \nimportant to bear in mind that they are predicated on these regions forming parts \nof global production systems. But what are the implications of these regions \nseeking to de-couple from such systems and switch to more autonomous and \nenvironmentally less damaging development trajectories, centred on maximising \nregionalised production and consumption, while acknowledging that there are \nlimits to both what can be produced and sold in a given region? Indeed, what are \nthe practical possibilities for seeking to re-orientate regional development in \nthese ways, given the imperatives of capital accumulation, the contradictory \ncharacter of capitalist development and the difficulties of moving to non-capitalist \nmodels? The prognosis is not a promising one, but the answer to this question \nwill have consequences that are not simply regional but global \n \n \nReferences \n \nBuerk R. 2006: Breaking Ships, New York, Chamberlain Books. \n \nChapman L. 2007: Transport and climate change: A review, Journal of Transport \nGeography, (in press). \n \n \u201cGlobalizing regional development: a global production networks perspective, \nTransactions of the Institute of British Geographers, New Series, 29, 468-484. \n \nCornell University, 2002: Cornell's Perspective on Eco-Industrial Parks, available \nat http:\/\/www.cfe.cornell.edu\/wei\/cupersp.html [accessed 3 \/December 2002]. \n \nFerri, M.
