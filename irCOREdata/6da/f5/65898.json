K. Mohapatra, T. R. Jackson and C. S. Adams\nDepartment of Physics, Durham University, Rochester Building, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, England.\n(Dated: February 1, 2008)\nWe observe electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) on the 5s\u2192 5p transition in a room\ntemperature rubidium vapour cell by coupling the 5p state to a Rydberg state (ns or nd with n = 26\nto 124). We demonstrate that the narrow line\u2013width of the EIT resonance (2 MHz) allows precise\nmeasurement of the d state fine structure splitting, and together with the sensitivity of the Rydberg\nstate to electric fields, we are able to detect transient electric fields produced by the dynamics\nof charges within the cell. Coherent coupling of Rydberg states via EIT could also be used for\ncross\u2013phase modulation and photon entanglement.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 32.80.Rm, 42.50.Gy\nIn comparison to low energy atomic states, highly ex-\ncited Rydberg states (with principal quantum n > 25)\ndisplay rich many\u2013body behavior due to their enhanced\ntwo\u2013body interactions [1, 2]. For example, a gas of ultra\u2013\ncold Rydberg atoms is found to evolve spontaneously into\na plasma [3] and back [4]. There is considerable interest\nin the potential to exploit the strong dipole \u2013 dipole inter-\naction between Rydberg atoms [5] to realise fast quan-\ntum gates [6, 7]. The dipole \u2013 dipole interactions also\nleads to ionization if the ions are not separately con-\nfined [8]. In addition, electromagnetically induced trans-\nparency (EIT) involving a Rydberg transition could be\nused to devise a photonic phase gate for optical quantum\ncomputing [9].\nExperimentally, Rydberg atoms are detected indirectly\nvia the ions or electrons produced by an ionization pulse\n[1]. This detection technique provides high efficiency but\nis destructive and the atom cannot be re\u2013used. For quan-\ntum information applications a non\u2013destructive detec-\ntion of the Rydberg state is preferable. One possibility\nis electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) which\nis manifest as an absence of absorption or an associated\nrapid variation in the dispersion allowing dissipation free\nsensing of the desired atomic resonance. EIT has been\nwidely studied in atomic vapors [10], frequently using a\n\u039b \u2013 scheme where a coherence is induced between two\nground states. Alternatively, in the ladder scheme the\ncoherence is induced between a ground state and an ex-\ncited state via an intermediate state [11]. Previously,\nexcited d states with principal quantum number up to\nn = 8 have been observed via optical probing of a ladder\nsystem [12].\nIn our work, we present experimental results on an EIT\nladder system involving highly excited Rydberg states\nwith n = 26 \u2212 124. We show that the non\u2013destructive\nprobing of a Rydberg level opens up an wide range of\npossible experiments. In particular we focus on two ap-\nplications: Firstly we exploit the narrow line\u2013width of\nthe EIT spectra to extend measurement of the nd series\nfine structure splitting up to n = 96. Secondly, we il-\nlustrate the potential of Rydberg EIT for detecting the\ndynamics of ions or electrons in the vicinity of the Ryd-\nberg excitation region. As ions can be produced by either\ninteractions [8] or the laser fields used to excite and trap\nRydberg atoms [13], knowledge of the role of ions is es-\nsential to the success of quantum gate schemes. As we\nshow Rydberg EIT provides an useful diagnostic of the\npresence of charges.\nThe energy levels of 85Rb relevant to this work and\nthe experimental set-up are shown in Fig. 1. The EIT\nladder system consists of a weak probe beam resonant\nwith 5s 2S1\/2(F = 3) \u2192 5p\n2P3\/2(F\n\u2032) transition and an\nintense coupling beam resonant with the 5p 2P3\/2(F\n\u2032)\u2192\nnd 2D3\/2 or 5p\n2P3\/2(F\n\u2032) \u2192 nd 2D5\/2 as indicated in\nFig. 1(a). The d state hyperfine splitting is negligi-\nble. The probe beam with wavelength \u03bbp = 780.24 nm,\npower 1 \u00b5W and beam size 0.4 mm (1\/e2 radius) propa-\ngates through a room temperature rubidium vapor cell of\nlength 75 mm, Fig. 1(b). The transmission through the\ncell as the probe beam is scanned is monitored on a pho-\ntodiode. The probe laser polarization is varied between\nlinear (vertical or horizontal) and circular using appro-\npriate waveplates. The coupling beam with wavelength\n\u03bbc = 479.2\u2212483.9 nm is produced by a commercial dou-\nbled diode laser system (Toptica TA-SHG). The coupling\nbeam counter\u2013propagates through the cell with a power\nup to 200 mW, a spot size of 0.8 mm (1\/e2 radius), and\nlinear polarization in the vertical direction. The vapor\ncell is placed inside a \u00b5-metal shield to reduce the effect\nof stray magnetic fields.\nA typical spectrum corresponding to the 85Rb\n5s 2S1\/2(F = 3) \u2192 5p\n2P3\/2 \u2192 45d ladder system is\nshown in Fig. 2. In (a) we show the probe absorption\nwith the coupling laser tuned close to and far way from\nthe 5p 2P3\/2(F = 4) \u2192 45d\n2D5\/2 resonance. The fre-\nquency axis is calibrated using the known splittings be-\ntween the 5p 2P3\/2 hyperfine states [14]. Note that due\nto the Doppler mismatch between the probe and cou-\npling lasers, the hyperfine splitting of the 5p 2P3\/2 state\nis scaled by a factor of 1\u2212 \u03bbc\/\u03bbp, and the fine structure\nsplitting of the nd state by \u03bbc\/\u03bbp.\nIn Fig. 2(b) we show the difference between the reso-\nnant and far\u2013detuned traces.

The fine and hyperfine splitting of the\nnd and 5p 2P3\/2 states respectively give rise to six two\u2013photon\nresonance lines. The Rydberg state hyperfine splitting is neg-\nligible.

Six EIT resonances are ob-\nserved.\nlines corresponding to transitions between the F = 2, 3,\nand 4 hyperfine states in the 5p 2P3\/2 state and both the\nfine structure components 2D3\/2 and\n2D5\/2 of the 45d\nstate as indicated in Fig. 1(a). The position of the EIT\npeak within the Doppler broadened absorption profile is\ndetermined by the coupling laser detuning. For a cou-\npling power of 180 mW, the largest peak corresponding\nto the 5p 2P3\/2(F = 4)\u2192 45d\n2D5\/2 resonance, produces\na change in the probe transmission of 5%. This peak\nheight is reduced and the width is increased by about a\nfactor of two if we remove the magnetic shield. The ob-\nserved spectra are not strongly dependent on the probe\nlaser polarization.\nThe line\u2013width of the EIT resonance is between 2 and\n4 MHz depending on the laser power and the transi-\ntion. The EIT line\u2013width is considerably narrower than\nthe natural width of the intermediate 5p states (6 MHz)\nbut much larger than the natural width of the Rydberg\nstates. At low probe laser power, the line\u2013width is lim-\nited by the line\u2013width of the probe and coupling lasers\nand incomplete cancellation of the Doppler shifts due to\nthe wavelength mismatch. The line\u2013width can be broad-\nened to of order 10 MHz by increasing the probe inten-\nsity above saturation providing a convenient signal for\nfrequency stabilization of the 480 nm laser.\nAlso apparent in Fig. 2(b) is that the lineshape of the\nEIT feature displays enhanced absorption just below and\nabove the two\u2013photon resonance. This effect arises due\nto the wavelength mismatch between the coupling and\nprobe lasers. Although the effect is known [15], it has not\nbeen observed in previous experiments. One can obtain\na theoretical prediction for the EIT lineshape using an\napproximate expression for the susceptibility derived in\nthe limit of a weak probe [11]\n\u03c7(v)dv = \u2212i\n3\u03bb2p\n4pi\n\u03b32N(v)dv\n[\n\u03b32 \u2212 i(\u2206p \u2212 kp \u00b7 v)+\n(\u2126c\/2)\n2\n\u03b33 \u2212 i(\u2206p +\u2206c \u2212 (kp + kc) \u00b7 v)\n]\u22121\n, (1)\nwhere \u2126p,c, \u2206p,c, and kp,c = 2pi\/\u03bbp,c are the probe or\ncoupling laser Rabi frequencies, detunings and wavevec-\ntors, respectively, andN(v) is the number density of 85Rb\natoms with velocity v. The decay rates \u03b32,3 are the nat-\nural widths of the intermediate and upper state in the\nladder system. Additional line broadening mechanisms\nsuch as laser line\u2013width can be included in \u03b33. By sum-\nming the contributions from the different hyperfine lines\nin the 5p 2P3\/2 state (with appropriate weightings) and\nintegrating the imaginary part of (1) over the velocity\ndistribution for a room temperature vapor one obtains\nthe absolute absorption coefficient, and hence the trans-\nmission through the vapor cell as a function of the probe\ndetuning. Multiple levels in the upper state of the ladder\nsystem can be included by adding extra coupling terms\nin Eq. (1) [16]. Fig. 3 shows the prediction of Eq. (1)\nin comparison to the experimental data for (a) n = 45\nand (b) n = 80. The only fit parameters are the Rabi\nfrequency and detuning of the coupling laser, the rate\n\u03b33, and the fine structure splitting of the d state. The\nenhanced absorption observed at higher \u2126c, Fig. 3(a), is\naccurately predicted by Eq. (1).\nFor the 80d state, Fig. 3(b), the change in the probe\ntransmission is reduced to about 1%. This is consistent\nwith the expected 1\/n3\/2 scaling of the coupling beam\nRabi frequency.

The EIT spectra give a direct measure of the\nd state fine structure splittings. Previous measurements\nusing two\u2013photon absorption and a thermionic diode to\ndetect the ionised Rydberg states have reported values up\nto n = 65 [17]. We are able to resolve the splitting up to\nn = 96. In Fig. 4 we plot the fine structure splitting as a\nfunction of n together with data from [17]. The line shows\na fit assuming a form A\/n\u22173 with A = 11.5(4)\u00d7103 GHz\nand n\u2217 = n \u2212 \u03b4, where \u03b4 = 1.35 is the quantum defect.\nThe n = 75 spectrum displays an asymmetric lineshape\nwhich leads to a systematic error. Our measured split-\ntings are typically larger than those observed in [17] by\nup to 10 MHz.\nFinally, we investigated the effect of an external elec-\ntric field on the Rydberg energy levels by applying a volt-\nage between the copper bar electrodes shown in Fig. 1(b).\nWe observe no effect on the EIT spectra for dc elec-\ntric fields up to 100 Vcm\u22121 regardless of the probe and\ncoupling laser polarizations suggesting that the Rydberg\natoms are being screened. The main source of charge\nwithin the cell appears to be ions and electrons pro-\nduced by photo \u2013 desorption induced by the coupling\nlaser at the surface of the cell [18]. For example, by\nretro\u2013reflecting the 480 nm laser with a glancing angle\nat the cell wall we can generate an asymmetric charge\ndistribution which creates a field of order 50 mV\/cm in\nthe EIT interaction region. We can detect this small field\nas a 2.5 MHz splitting of the 70d line.\nTo further investigate the screening effect and charge\ndynamics within the cell, we studied the effect switch-\ning the electric field direction in a time of order 1 \u00b5s.\nFor a dc field, the charges drift with a distribution which\nexactly compensates the applied field. However, if the\nfield is switched in a time less than the relaxation time\nof the charge distribution there is incomplete cancella-\ntion of the applied field leading to a perturbation of the\nEIT signal.

The change in transmission (\u2206T ) as the field\nis switched is shown in Fig. 5(inset). Each time the field\ndirection changes the EIT peak is suppressed due to the\ntransient penetration of the applied field. The duration\nof this transient depends linearly on the amplitude of the\nfield, and decreases exponentially with the coupling laser\npower, see Fig. 5. The dependence on the coupling laser\npower arises because at higher power the charge density\nis increased and the distribution can relax faster towards\nthe steady\u2013state fully\u2013screened distribution.

Similar spectra have recently been ob-\nserved by ionizing ultra\u2013cold Rydberg atoms [20]. In a\ntime varying field, one may not expect to observe nar-\nrow lines, however, due to the quadratic dependence on\nthe electric field, the time dependence of the resonance\nlines has a rectified sin2\u2013dependence which is almost like\na dc field. The distortion of the lineshape due to the\ntime\u2013dependence of the field is most apparent in the\n2D5\/2(|mJ | = 1\/2) line (at \u2212120 MHz in Fig. 6(d)) as\nit has the highest field sensitivity. These results indicate\nthat Rydberg EIT could provide a useful optical probe\nof photo\u2013ionization processes and plasma dynamics.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the coherent op-\ntical detection of highly excited Rydberg states (up to\nn = 124) using EIT, providing a direct non\u2013destructive\nprobe of Rydberg energy levels. The observed spectra,\ndisplay enhanced absorption below and above the Ryd-\nberg resonance, and can be accurately predicted by the\noptical Bloch equations. The narrow line\u2013width of the\nEIT resonance allows us to extend measurements of the\nfine structure splitting of the nd series up to n = 96. We\nalso show that the EIT spectra are sensitive to charge\ndynamics within the cell. In our experiment the density\nof atoms participating in the EIT resonance is more than\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than the density used in\nthe observation of dipole blockade [5]. In future work\nwe will apply the technique to higher density vapors to\ninvestigate dipole blockade effects and their potential ap-\nplication in photon entanglement [9].\nWe are grateful to S. L.
