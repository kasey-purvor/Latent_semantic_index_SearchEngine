Faulkner, The Essence of Human-Computer\nInteraction, London: Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN:\n0-13-751975-3. Paperback, 196 pages. \u00a314.95.\nThose who have ever been involved in\ndeveloping CAL materials and\/or resources to\nsupport electronic course delivery will realize the\nimportant role that end-user interfaces play\nwithin the systems they develop. It is through the\nend-user interface sub-system that users develop\ntheir understanding of a software product and\nare able to utilize the skills\/knowledge embedded\nwithin it. The design of 'quality' end-user inter-\nfaces requires an understanding of relevant\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI) issues, such\nas mental models and the ways in which\nindividuals process and react to computer-based\ninformation. This new monograph by Christine\nFaulkner offers a useful introduction to this\narea.\nThe book is organized into nine chapters and a\nglossary. Each chapter is written in a standard\nformat in that each concludes with a useful\nsummary section, a set of references (both to\nsource material that exists in paper-based\npublications and electronic items available on the\nWeb), and a set of exercises that reinforce the\nconcepts presented. Throughout the book,\ndiagrams are used in an effective way to illustrate\nimportant issues.\nThe opening chapter gives an overview of HCI\nand its multidisciplinary nature. It examines the\nbackground to the subject and discusses its role\nas a discipline worthy of study. In Chapter 2 the\nauthor discusses the user's physical capabilities -\ncognition, vision, sound, touch, taste and smell -\nand how these influence end-user interface\ndesign. Chapter 3 goes on to consider the user's\nmental capabilities. This is quite an interesting\nchapter in that it introduces many self-tests to\nenable readers to explore their own memory\nabilities, although I was somewhat disappointed\nthat it did not contain any reference to the more\ndetailed seminal work by Card, Moran and\nNewell (on the human information processor\nmodel) and their classic book on this subject.\nIn Chapter 4 the author gets into a detailed\ndiscussion of the principles of interface design.\nHere she presents a useful classification of\n109\nReviews\ninteraction styles, then discusses the important\ndifferences between direct and linguistic manipu-\nlation within the context of designing end-user\ninterfaces. Design issues are further considered\nin Chapter 5 where there is a discussion of the\ndifferent types of user likely to be encountered in\na HCI system, and how their needs should be\naccommodated through various design processes\nsuch as task analysis, data collection and rapid\nprototyping.\nAs is the case with all computer-systems\ndevelopment work, evaluation and testing are of\nparamount importance. Various issues associ-\nated with this topic are addressed in Chapter 6.\nNaturally, because of the restricted size and\n'overview' nature of this monograph, these\nissues are addressed only in a cursory way.\nNevertheless, the book does cover most of the\nimportant topics that need to be considered,\nsuch as hypothesis formation, experimental\ndesign and the use of questionnaires, interviews\nand evaluation experiments.\nThe evaluation techniques described in Chapter\n6 are often used to measure the 'usability' of a\ncomputer system and its associated set of end-\nuser interfaces. The content of Chapter 7\n('Making Systems that People Can Use')\ntherefore follows on quite naturally from the\nprevious one. Its main thrust is a discussion of\nusability engineering; this is followed by a\nsection on socio-technical design issues - that is,\nfitting the process of design into the framework\nof the needs of the organization involved. Sadly,\nthe early part of this chapter makes no mention\nof the important (and well-known) work on\nusability that has been undertaken by Shackel's\nhuman factors group at Loughborough. Still,\nthe treatment presented suffices as a modest\nintroduction to this important area.\nFundamental to good HCI design are considera-\ntions of relevant ergonomic, health and safety\nissues. The relevance of these topics is discussed\nin Chapter 8, while the final chapter looks to the\nfuture. It discusses the problems of introducing\ncomputers into the workplace and the home;\nthere is also a section on computers and the law\n(which deals mainly with copyright issues).\nBearing in mind the impact of the World Wide\nWeb (which is discussed in a section called\n'Hypertext and the Web'), I was disappointed\nthat this chapter made no mention of the future\npotential impact of HCI (and computers in\ngeneral) on the ways in which we learn, study\nand communicate. Another major omission\n110\nfrom this chapter, in my view, is any mention of\nvirtual reality and the requirements that this\ntechnique places on end-user interface design.\nOverall, despite the limitations that I have\nalluded to, I enjoyed reading this book. It would\nform a valuable 'taster' for those wishing to find\nout more about HCI and its many applications,\nparticularly future CAL developers whose aims\nshould be to produce effective, efficient and\nusable CAL software.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nInternational Encyclopedia of Educational\nTechnology, edited by Tjeerd Plomp and Donald\nP. Ely (2nd edition), Oxford: Pergamon (Elsevier\nScience Ltd), 1996. ISBN: 0-08-042307-8. Hard-\nback, 692 pages. Dutch Florins 356.\nThe nature of educational technology is\ncurrently undergoing a period of rapid change\nand development. This is largely being driven by\ndevelopments in Communication and Informa-\ntion Technology, but is by no means limited to it.\nThe changing technology is also modifying our\nunderstanding of many aspects of educational\ntheory. This encyclopaedia is designed as a\n'reference source for researchers, faculty\nmembers, teacher educators, government\nofficials, educational administrators, and policy-\nmakers'; and it would certainly provide any of\nthose with a useful point of departure for\napproaching any of the range of issues touched\nupon by developments in educational tech-\nnology.\nIt is part of a series of one-volume encyclo-\npaedias drawing upon articles from the Inter-\nnational Encyclopaedia of Education. This\nvolume contains some 123 articles of .which 19\nwere especially commissioned for it. They cover\nthe whole range of educational technology issues\nfrom theoretical discussions of instructional\npsychology (Lowyck and Elen) and\nconstructivism (Cobb), to the practical design of\nlearning spaces (Knirk) and the production of\nvarious media (various contributors).\nThe entries are organized into five broad\ncategories: (i) Education Technology: Definition\nand Conceptual Background; (ii) Design Func-\ntions, Tools and Resources; (iii) Delivery\nOptions; (iv) Applications and Institutional\nSettings; and finally, (v) Emerging Issues. Each\nof these sections is then further divided into a\nnumber of sub-sections that make their contents\nmore accessible. However, the editors are at\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\npains to point out that the sections are inevitably\nsomewhat arbitrary and that entries might well\nhave appeared in more than one category. In\ngeneral, they have done a good job of cross-\nreferencing materials throughout. Accordingly,\npursuing an inquiry is likely to lead the reader to\ncover a range of related issues. Indeed, the\naccessibility of information within this encyclo-\npaedia of is one of its greatest strengths. And\naccessibility is further enhanced by a useful\nsubject index and an index of all the names\nreferred to throughout the text. Finally, each\narticle contains a substantial bibliography of\nfurther reading that extends the reach of the\nencyclopaedia beyond its covers.\nA brief examination of each of the five sections\nwill help to give a better idea of the nature and\nscope of the collection. The first, Education\nTechnology: Definition and Background, sets\nout a view of educational technology ' . . . as a\nproblem-solving process, concerning most\naspects of teaching and learning through media\nand technology, in the context of education and\ntraining*. This section then considers some of\nthe various fields that contribute to aspects of\neducational technology, including such theor-\netical ones as those mentioned above and areas\nlike ergonomics (Oborne) and Artificial Intelli-\ngence (Elsom-Cook). Again at a practical level\nthis section also sets out detailed lists of journals\nand organizations that treat issues associated\nwith educational technology.\nThe second and one of the two longest sections,\nDesign Functions, Tools and Resources, covers\nthose issues that arise in the design, development\nand production of learning resources. It includes\nsections on Needs Assessment, Design, Media\nProduction, Evaluation, Diffusion and Imple-\nmentation, Management, and Resources. The\nlast section touches upon resources such as\nLibraries (Woolls) and Information Systems\n(Brandhorst). The Media Production section is\nparticularly valuable, containing as it does\nspecific entries for each of range of media\nincluding text, still images, audio and computer\nprograms. However, it does have one odd lacuna:\nvideo. Although the use of television as a dis-\nsemination medium is touched upon elsewhere\n(e.g. by Tiene, and by Grabowski), there is no\nentry on the issues involved in the production of\ntelevisual materials. Given the ever-increasing\nimportance of video and other animated images\nwithin multimedia learning resources, this does\nseem a rather serious omission.\nThe third section, Delivery Options, is the other\nmajor section of the encyclopaedia and it is\ndivided into sections that cover Strategies,\nTechniques, Materials, and Devices. There is\nconsiderable overlap between this section and\nthe previous one, but with the very important\ndifference that while the second section deals\nwith issues concerned in the production and\ndevelopment of resources, this section deals\nexplicitly with issues that arise in the delivery of\nthose resources. Thus, while the second section\ncontains entries about the production of various\nmedia, this contains entries about the 'role' of\nsuch media (e.g. Denning and Read, or Russell\nand Molenda). The section also deals with\nvarious strategic issues like -the exploitation of\nmodular curricula (Warwick) or the use of\ndiscovery learning (Tamir) or open learning\n(Lewis).\nThe fourth section, Applications and\nInstitutional Settings, discusses Educational\nSectors, Subject Matter Domains, and what are\ndescribed as Other Applications. As one would\nsuppose, the first of these sub-sections provides\nentries on such things as the role of technology\nin primary and secondary education (Molenda),\nspecial-needs education (Thorkildsen), voca-\ntional education (Roth), distance education\n(Bates) and teacher education (Collis). Interest-\ningly, there is no entry for Higher Education.\nThe sub-section on subject matter domains\ncovers maths (Olive), science (Voogt) and\nlanguages (Ng), as well as more general articles\non the curriculum. Under the heading of Other\nApplications, this fourth touches upon issues like\nplanning (Colletta and Kwong) and research\n(Schliecher).\nThe last section looks forward to a range of\n'Emerging Issues', and these include among\nothers: the impact of broadcasting (Comstock),\nvisual literacy (Petterson) and gender (Janssen,\nReinen and Plomp) The final entry also deserves\na special mention. It is on Copyright (Sinofsky):\nthe impact of this issue on the economics of\neducation is something that no educator or\neducation manager can afford to ignore.\nAlthough this encyclopaedia appropriately ends\nwith a section on emerging issues, it is the\nemergent nature of the technology that generates\nthe book's greatest weakness. It is inevitable that\nmuch of what is contained within any such\ncompendium will be out of date almost before\nit is published, and this is certainly true for a\nnumber of entries here. An examination of the\nI I I\nReviews\nsuggestions for further reading indicates that,\noverall, the entries are up-to-date up to and\nincluding 1995. After that, references become\nsomewhat thin. But this is of course inevitable.\nThe encyclopaedia is a snapshot of the state of\nthe art in about 1995, and as such provides a\nuseful point of departure for researchers in the\nfield. However, the field is rapidly developing.\nThe clearest example of this is with reference to\nthe Internet. There are several hundred index\nentries for computers, computing, software,\ncourseware etc., but there are fewer than 20\nreferences to the Internet or the World Wide\nWeb, and none whatsoever for 'intranet'.\nFurthermore, none of these references is sub-\nstantial, most merely indicating that this will be\nan important development in the future. The\nprediction was right, and a 1998 edition of such\nan encyclopaedia would tell a very different\nstory.\nOf course, this is less of a problem for entries\ndealing with more theoretical or general issues.\nThe discourse of education theory has moved on\nin the last three years, but probably less radically\nthan some of the technologies. Further, it is\nprobably still more clearly in touch with its roots.\nReferences to Piaget or Vygotsky are likely to\nremain of interest for sometime. As such, it is\nstill possible to recommend the second edition of\nTTte International Encyclopedia of Educational\nTechnology, perhaps not for purchase by\nindividuals, but certainly as a valuable reference\ntool in libraries until it is time for the third\nedition.\nBruce Ingraham, University of Teesside\nAmanda Scott, Learning Centres: A Step-By-\nStep Guide to Planning, Managing and\nEvaluating an Organizational Resource Centre,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1997. ISBN: 0-7494-2293-\n9. Hardback, 216 pages. \u00a327.50.\nThis book provides a set of guidelines on how to\ninitiate, promote, establish and run a learning\nresource centre within a business organization.\nMy initial reaction was positive: someone was\ngoing to tell me all the pitfalls in establishing a\nlearning centre and how to avoid them. But it\nquickly became apparent that the emphasis was\non business organizations rather than educa-\ntional ones. Obviously, there are differences\nbetween these organizations with respect to the\nway in which staff can be motivated to adopt\nnew skills and practices.\n112\nThere are 13 snappy chapters, most of which are\nfewer than eight pages, and they provide a\nhelpful compendium of tips and checklists.\nTimescales and costs, issues to do with starting,\nresourcing and marketing a centre within organ-\nizations are all quickly dealt with. The bulk of\nthe book is devoted to chapters on Admin-\nistration and Logistics, and to case studies.\nIn the opening chapter, the author extols the\nvirtues of self-development through resource-\nbased learning, but concludes that it is not a\n'natural process'; in other words, that it is not\nsomething in which most staff indulge unless\nencouraged to do so. Thus the premise of much\nof what follows is that while it may be in an\norganization's interest for staff to develop their\nexpertise, it is also that organization's respons-\nibility to provide the facilities, time and the\nmotivation for them to do so. Transferring this\nidea to the management of teachers in Higher\nEducation would be a major leap forward!\nThe chapters which follow examine the early\ntasks of the learning-centre manager - establish-\ning the need for the centre, getting support from\nsenior management, overcoming resistance,\nfunding, and so on. All these tasks are treated\nwith an industrial eye. There are many lessons to\nbe learned in higher education from this\napproach, but they may run contrary to the\nimage of universities as the home of inde-\npendent, free-thinking scholars. Offering gifts,\nholding competitions to name the centre,\nproviding games, involving families, and giving\nmonetary rewards for learning are all sugges-\ntions to build interest and support.\nThe author then moves on to starting the\nproject. This involves setting up a working party,\nmaking crucial decisions like opening hours,\nsecurity, assessing training needs, marketing the\ncentre and organizing a launch. Following, this,\nthe author discusses what to put into the centre\nby reviewing resources and evaluating their use.\nThere is a chapter on multimedia which con-\ncentrates on technical issues, as though all\nteaching materials were available in all formats\nand that there really is a choice between CD-I\nand CD-ROM other than one based on the\navailability of software.\nThe most stark contrast between the industrial\napproach and that in higher education is\ncontained in Chapter 9 with a debate on the need\nfor non-vocational materials to induce staff to\nuse the centre (programmes on home furnishing,\nplanning a wedding, cookery, foreign-language\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\ntraining, setting up your own business, etc.). A\nsmall section on the Internet ('Does it have a\nplace in the learning centre?') again betrays the\nnon-academic provenance of the work.\nThe heart of the book is the administration and\nlogistics of running a centre. Bitter experience\nhas shown many of us that it is the lack of\ncontinuing time, resources and commitment\nwhich results in the initial enthusiasm fading and\nthe number of return visits to such a centre\ndeclining. Students are good in this respect.\nEverything is new to them all the time, and they\nare motivated by assessment. Staff, however, are\nmore difficult. The book proposes addressing\nthe problem of continuing interest by deploying\nincentives to keep staff coming back. Learning-\nrelated pay, establishing a learning club,\nrewarding performance (1\/2 hour =10 points -\n100 points and you get a prize or air miles). It\nwould be interesting to see the reaction to these\nsuggestions from the cynics with whom I work!\nThe case studies make interesting reading. Some\nmotivation behind forming a centre in the first\nplace can be the difficulty of releasing staff for\nformal courses. As the move towards the formal\ntraining of university staff to teach gathers\nmomentum, this is an aspect of such courses\nwhich will become increasingly important\nespecially for split-site institutions. The larger\ncentres have full-time managers whose\nresponsibility it is to man the centre, run\ninduction sessions, purchase and maintain\nhardware and software, etc. Others have systems\nin which this responsibility is shared between\nindividuals who also have other responsibilities.\nThe implication of the case studies is that\npermanent manning is the most effective way of\npromoting the use of a centre.\nThe appendices contain forms for evaluating\nmaterials and evaluating the centre itself, a\nreading list, and some screen dumps from a\nnumber of common computer-based teaching\nprograms.\nIs this book going to be of interest to ALT\nmembers who mostly work in higher education?\nIt is difficult to read from front to back, but it\ndoes contain some excellent ideas which might\nbe adapted for use in, say, a launch of a centre or\nin those desperate moments when a centre\nmanager has sat all day in an empty room. It\nalso provides some interesting insights into what\nis possible in the workplace when profits depend\non a highly motivated and trained workforce. So,\nas a work of reference, I am glad to have it on\nmy bookshelf. I am sure that I will be using it\nwhen the University decides that day release for\nteaching staff doing the Postgraduate Certificate\nin Undergraduate Teaching is no longer possible,\nand that self-development through a learning\ncentre is the most cost-effective way forward.\nTony Cook, University of Ulster\nPat Hedges, Increasing Profitability by the\nEffective Use of Learning, London: Kogan Page,\n1997. ISBN: 0-7494-2082-0, Hardback, 248\npages. \u00a325.\nIn scope and range this is an ambitious book. Its\nexplicit focus is on 'outputs':\n'[. . .] the quantifiable results of learning, the\nmanifestation of the personal experience of\ngrowing and improving performance on a con-\ntinuous basis. It demonstrates the accrual of\nadvantage to be gained in producing a system\nof self-perpetuating growth in performance\nimprovement which, both individually and with\nthe benefit of synergy of productive teams, posit-\nively increases the finances of business.' (page 1)\nThe introduction goes further to identify that the\nbook:\n'[. . .] has been written with learners, trainers,\ntraining providers, managers, team leaders evalu-\nators and HRD specialists in mind. People in\norganisations who may be contemplating\nstandards-based performance systems, or who are\nalready involved in them. Above all, the book is\nfor individuals who wish to improve their\nperformance, whatever job they do. They will\nreceive advice, guidance and hopefully the\nmotivation to fully realise their potential and help\ntheir organisation towards productivity.' (page 2)\nAmbitious indeed!\nThere are 12 chapters with supporting\nappendices, references, suggestions for further\nreading, and a comprehensive index.\nChapter 1 offers a whirlwind account of the\ndistinctions between training and learning. There\nis an assured matter-of-factness about much of\nthis chapter that may limit its use to educators and\ntrainers. Chapters 2 to 5 offer an introductory\nreview of organizational structures, organizational\nculture, and leadership. Much of this will be\nfamiliar to readers of Handy or similar subject-\nauthors. Both checklists and questionnaires are\nused extensively in these chapters. Chapter 6\nexplores 'Your influence on your performance'.\nThis seems to be, at one level, a pivotal chapter,\n113\nReviews\ngiven the stated focus of the text to promote self-\nawareness and self-help. At another level, it sits\nuneasily in content and style in a text\npredominately written to this point, and\nsubsequently, for a more professional or manager-\nial audience. This illustrates my primary concern\nwith this book: specifically, that in attempting to\nbe comprehensive and of value to everyone, it is\ninsufficiently focused on either the individual\nseeking to explore her\/his own training needs, or\nthe organization assessing the value of specific\napproaches to training in a turbulent environment.\nThis tension caused by a commendable desire to\nbe comprehensive underpins the remaining\nchapters of the book. Chapter 7 briefly considers\nthe trainers' influence on performance. Chapter 8\nis a more substantial consideration of the\nrationale for training decisions. The identifica-\ntion of poor performance and developing means\nof improving performance are the focus of\nChapters 9 and 10. Chapter 11, at 49 pages the\nlongest by far, explores the complex field of\nvalidating and evaluating performance improve-\nment interventions. In a change of style, three\ncase studies are used to demonstrate the use of a\nrange of performance indicators. Both the case\nstudies and the summary points made by the\nauthor may be of interest to both practising\nmanagers and Human Resource professionals. I\nam less confident that those who earn a living\nthrough evaluative practice will learn much they\ndid not already know. Indeed, there are many in\nthe field of academic evaluation who might\nquestion the view that 'the job of the evaluator is\nto [. . .] turn subjective evidence into objective\nevidence [. . . and] feedback results with\nconclusions and recommendations.' (173-4).\nThe final chapter follows an approach often found\nin Kogan Page publications: a short action-\nfocused advocacy of the author's case. In The\nEmployer's Dream', Hedges offers an articulate\nand impassioned rebuttal of a set of objections to\nstandards-based performance systems. She con-\ncludes with an equally clear set of assertions\nregarding the organizational and individual\nbenefits to be realized by achieving competence\nthrough performance standards. It is questionable\nwhether the earlier text justifies these assertions, or\nindeed the earlier rebuttals. However, the polemic\nis powerful and makes interesting reading.\nThis book explicitly seeks to address a significant\nrange of issues and engage a wide audience. It\noffers advice and practical checklists which will\nbe largely familiar to teachers of business\n114\norganizations, to organizational trainers and\nthose familiar with NVQ and other competence-\nbased training programmes. To a large extent it is\na self-help book with a strong practical focus and\na commendable clarity of style. Nonetheless, the\nreader would be advised to look elsewhere for an\nanalysis which problematizes the contribution of\ncompetence-based learning or explores the\nmethodological complexities of evaluating such a\ncontribution. Rather, the text offers models of\nperceived good practice to inform and guide the\npractitioner based on the author's considerable\nexperience in the field.\nOverall, I found the book rather like a hastily\narranged dinner party for people who are not\nquite friends - excellent in parts, less than that in\nother parts, and inconclusive at the end. Clearly\nthe author knows the field. But in attempting to\naddress the widest possible readership, I sense\nthat the opportunity to produce a far better book\nhas been missed. Maybe the title is a little\nmisleading. This is a book that advocates, in a\nrelatively uncritical way, a particular approach to,\nand rationale for, training. As such it has genuine\nvalue. But I am not convinced that it offers\nsufficient new insights in areas such as learning\ntheory and the individual's motivation to learn to\nfully engage the wide-ranging audience it seeks, or\nto justify the largely unproblematic relationship\nbetween learning and profitability it presents.\nPeter FunneU, University College Suffolk\nJane Hart and Kirk Martinez, Glacial Analysis -\nAn Interactive Introduction, London: Routledge,\n1997.

The authors see the package\nbeing used in first- and second-year under-\ngraduate courses in glacial geomorphology\/\ngeology and in more general courses training for\nfieldwork. They also expect final-year under-\ngraduates to use the package for revision\npurposes. The package is suitable to run on a\nWindows PC or Macintosh system, and was very\neasy to install on a Windows PC.\nSection 1 of the CD-ROM introduces students\nto the glacial environment. Topics that are\nrequired for the later stages of the package are\ndealt with in more depth in this section. There is\na large amount of information that is well\nillustrated with case-study photographs, videos,\nexplanatory graphics and animations. The\nanimations are excellent, assisting understanding\nof some of the more complex concepts of debris\nmovement within a glacier.\nThe second section of the package details what is\nrequired from fieldwork to produce a correct\nanalysis. Information and the techniques used\nfor data collection are given for each aspect of a\nglacial sample. The material is well illustrated\nwith photographic examples from the field.\nKnowledge gained is reinforced by. questions.\nTill fabric is first introduced in Section 2, which\nlooks at the method for collecting data on till\nfabric in the field. A video clip demonstrates the\nprocess from start to finish. Once the results\nhave been collected, there are four different\nmethods for plotting the data. The first two\nmethods are simpler, and students have an\nopportunity to practise the skill on-screen. The\nlatter two methods are more complex: students\nare expected to analyse the results of these\nwithin the package. This section equips students\nwith the ability to collect data in the field and\ndecide on a suitable analysis of their results.\nFolds and faults are also first introduced in\nSection 2. An introduction to the cause of these\nfeatures is provided. Animations show exactly\nhow the features arise, knowledge that is\nrequired in the measuring of folds and faults.\nBrief instructions are given for measuring these\nfeatures in the field. Unfortunately, unlike the\ntill-fabric section, there is no explicit illustration\nfrom the field on how to take measurements.\nStudents are also given an exercise to explore\nmethods of analysis of the results.\nThe next section provides summary information\non the different till types that students may\nencounter in the field. Further information is\nprovided in table form to help decide which\nenvironment these originate from. This section is\nuseful for students as a guide when returning\nfrom fieldwork with results.\nIn order to review and improve on knowledge\ngained from the package, the final section\npresents a number of exercises. These involve\nanswering questions that vary in style and\ninclude multiple choice, clicking on an image\nand free-text entry. The questions require\ndetailed analysis rather than simply repeating\nfacts. Expanded feedback as to why answers are\ncorrect or incorrect would have been useful\nfurther to improve understanding.\nOther sections of the CD-ROM act as additional\nreferences. A glossary gives definitions for a\nnumber of terms used in the package. These\ndefinitions can also be accessed in the main text\nof the software by clicking on highlighted words.\nAll the references used in the package are\ncollected in a bibliography for ease of access.\nThe glossary and bibliography are also\nreproduced in full in the package booklet.\nAdditional functionality is provided by the\nsearch and edit tools. The Search function allows\nsearching on a keyword. The results will show all\nthe screens in which the word is mentioned and\nallow navigation to any of them. The Edit\nfacility allows text from the package to be pasted\ninto the editor window and modified as required\nbefore being printed or saved.\nDespite its usefulness, I do have a few com-\nplaints about this package. The size of the text\nmakes it difficult to read; having to hold the\nmouse button down while reading definitions of\nwords becomes tiring after a while; and I could\nnot get the Web link to work.\nBut, in general, this is a very attractive, well-\ndesigned package with many excellent photo-\ngraphs, animations and videos used wisely to\nillustrate concepts. It does what its title suggests,\nand gives an interactive introduction to glacial\nanalysis, and in particular the collection and\nanalysis of glacial sediments.\nRobert Sherratt, University of Leicester\nShirley Fletcher, Competence-Based Assessment\nTechniques (2nd edition), London: Kogan Page,\n1997.

This book seeks to guide a\nnewcomer through the concepts that underlie\ncompetence-based systems, and to highlight\nimplementation issues. The author claims to\ncover in detail the What, Why, Where When,\nHow and Who of CBA. This review details the\nstructure of the book, and its strengths and its\nweaknesses in the light of its challenging remit.\nIt comprises two parts, namely: Foundations of\nCompetence-Based Assessment and Practical\nApplication. Each of the eight chapters is\nprefaced by a summary and finished by a review,\nwith frequent diagrams intended to aid the\nreader. The first three chapters deal with the\nfoundations of CBA. Chapter 1 differentiates\nbetween the different competence-based systems,\nin particular comparing the American and\nBritish models. A brief comparison is made with\nthe 'traditional' model. The traditional model\nseems to be based on school rather college or\nuniversity systems as the assessment is stated to\nbe norm-based rather than criterion-referenced\/\nvalidated. I am pleased to say the book makes\nthis terminology clear to the newcomer to this\narea. A more thorough explanation of CBA\nfollows in chapter two. This chapter draws a\nclear line between the purpose of traditional and\nCBA. In addition, it outlines the implications of\ntaking a CBA approach. Chapter 3 concludes\nPart 1 of the book with a description of the\npurposes and uses of CBA.\nPart 2 covers the practical application of CBA.\nThis begins in Chapter 4 by considering what is\nbeing assessed, the criteria used and the reason\nfor performing an assessment. The chapter\nfinishes by looking at some of the human factors\nthat affect assessment. Chapter 5 concentrates\non how evidence is collected. The various forms\nof evidence are discussed and issues relating to\nthe ability of assessors to do the task properly\nare covered. Once the evidence is collected, it\nclearly must be related to some form of stand-\nard. Concepts relating to standards such as\ntransparency, validity, reliability, authenticity,\ncurrency and sufficiency are described in\nChapter 6. Chapter 7 deals with what happens\nafter the assessment is finished. People who do\nnot meet the standard must be dealt with, the\nresults must be recorded and new training needs\nidentified and catered for. As the chapter is only\nfour pages long, a limited amount of material is \u2022\ncovered. The final chapter, which deals with\nquality assurance, is again rather short.\n116\nFrom the above description of the book it would\nappear that all possible contingencies are\ncovered, but the book is only 96 pages long. The\nreview section is two sentences long, and the\nfigures are often effectively bullet points with\nboxes drawn around them rather than being true\nfigures. The author concentrates on defining all\nthe terms and identifying all the issues involved.\nVery little critical analysis of CBA is provided.\nFor example, CBA has only two outcomes:\ncompetent or not competent. Different degrees\nof competence are described as demoralizing,\nand unnecessary if a worker is competent at a\ntask. However, a manager may wish to know the\ndegree of competence exhibited by different\nworkers when attempting to allocate tasks to a\nteam. The argument for a simple decision, com-\npetent or not competent, is clear, but no attempt\nis made to deal with the counter argument. Line\nmanagers are identified as assessors in the\nworkplace: what do you do if the line manager is\nnot willing or competent to perform the assess-\nment? Can you always risk finding out that\nsomebody is incompetent by observing them\ndoing the job?\nThe reader is likely to be somebody who is\ninterested in introducing CBA to a company.\nConsequently, issues such as how to justify the\nresource implications should be covered.\nMethods of costing the training of assessors,\ndesigning of courses, and changing the corpor-\nate culture are not given. The detailed case\nstudies would have been invaluable if they had\nincluded such costing and shown that identifi-\nable benefits, that outweighed the costs, accrued\nto the companies within a two-year period.\nI can nevertheless recommend this book to the\nnewcomer to CBA. Despite my criticisms, it\ndescribes the terminology and issues very well. I\nfound that having read a chapter, I had a very\nclear idea of the difficulties I would face in\ndesigning a CBA course. If, however, you already\nknow the issues and are looking for solutions to\nthe thorny practicalities of convincing manage-\nment and implementing courses, you need to\nlook elsewhere.\nBrian Turton, University of Wales College, Cardiff\nShirley Fletcher, Analysing Competence: Tools\nand Techniques for Analysing Jobs, Roles and\nFunctions, London: Kogan Page, 1997. ISBN: 0-\n7494-2195-9. Paperback, 118 pages. \u00a315.99.\nThis book is one of the Practical Trainer series\npublished by Kogan Page, which, as the name\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nsuggests, aim to give concise practical advice on a\nparticular topic. Analysing Competence is no\nexception. It is a brief outline of the main\nprinciples involved in an analysis of performance\nat work. In the brief introduction, the author\nemphasizes the importance of defining the\nproblem and considering the actual and potential\nusers of the analysis results at the beginning of the\nexercise. Competence is related to the structure of\nwork, the expectations of work and human\nperformance, all of which should be considered in\nany analysis. The author suggests that completing\nan analysis of these relationships would form the\nbasis of a valuable and accepted vehicle for\nimproving business performance. There is a wide-\nspread interest in competence and frameworks, in\nparticular relating to training and education.\nLearning outcomes, for example, are measured as\ncompetences in NVQ documentation. The book\nconsists of only three chapters, the last of which\nforms the bulk of the text.\nThe first chapter discusses the concept of com-\npetence, though the difference between 'com-\npetences' and 'competencies' does not at first\nbecome clear. Also, the concept of a 'competence\nframework' is not explained in detail. However,\nthe author does explain that competence analysis\nand the resulting competence framework will only\ndefine the competencies, and to be of use in\nsolving performance problems they need to form\nthe basis of further analysis. This chapter aims to\nhelp with defining the analysis and development\nproject, taking account of all influencing factors,\nand ends with a clear checklist for the reader to\nuse. There is also a useful table of definitions\n(although its label and reference have been\nomitted from the text).\nThe second chapter begins with an outline for the\nreader to complete as a key reference document to\nthe purposes of the study. The reader is then\ndirected to the three steps of an analysis: identify\ncomponents, examine relationships between com-\nponents, restructure components. The author\nsuggests that no single tool or technique will cover\nall three steps of the analysis, but a tool should be\nselected that will give the right kind of\ninformation for each step. There are two\nsummary tables: one gives lists of tools and\ntechniques for each of the three steps, the other\nlists uses of the competence framework in terms\nof the actual work being done. The chapter ends\nwith an example proforma on which the reader\ncan record the scope of the analysis and\ndevelopment project, including: overview, agreed\ndefinition of competence, goal of project, object-\nives of project, resources, management, products\/\noutcomes, evaluation, tools and techniques.\nThe third chapter is the longest. Here, the tools\nand techniques applicable to a study of\ncompetences are described. There is a good\nsummary of each tool and which of the three\nsteps it could be applied to. For quick reference,\nthe chapter is separated into three sections\ncorresponding to these three steps. The space\ndevoted to serves only to give a brief outline, but a\nwide variety of tools and techniques are\nsuggested, ranging from functional analysis and\ncard-sort through to flow-chart, critical-path\nanalysis and repertory grids. The reader is\ndirected as to when and how to use each tool,\ntogether with advantages and disadvantages of its\nuse. From the range of tools and techniques\npresented, the analyst should be able to select\nsomething suitable for a particular study. It would\nhave been useful if the author had suggested\nreferences to find more details about each one,\nthough a reader who has experience of using\nproblem-solving techniques would be able to\nattempt to use these tools from the outlines given.\nThe references section at the end of the book\nappears to be fairly comprehensive, though with\nno recent publications cited. This is surprising in\nview of the statement in Chapter 1 that there is\n'increasing interest in the subject [...] demon-\nstrated by the wide range of publications\ndevoted solely to [it]'. Within the text, some\nterms are mentioned, but not defined, and no\nreference is given for explanation of the terms.\nThe text would have been improved by citing\nreferences and providing an index.\nThe book claims to 'help you to think innova-\ntively to create a tailored solution for specific\nperformance problems', and the various tech-\nniques presented would certainly provoke\ninnovative thought in the reader. This book\nwould be useful for someone wanting a brief\noutline of a variety of techniques for analysing\ncompetence at work, and the tables etc. would\nprovide useful aide-memoirs for someone\ncarrying out such an exercise.\nJanice Whatley, Manchester Metropolitan University\nThe Challenge of Problem-Based Learning,\nedited by David Boud and Graham E. Feletti (2nd\nedition), London: Kogan Page, 1997. ISBN 0-\n7494-2291-2, 1997, Hardback, 344 pages. \u00a335.\nIn reviewing this book, I have to confess at the\noutset to a bias in favour of the general cause\n117\nReviews\nthat it seeks to promote. Higher education is less\neffective and efficient than it could be, largely\nbecause of the persistence of educational\nmethods based on the oral tradition of\ncommunication. Methods which encourage a\nmove away from the lecture room towards a\ngreater degree of engagement by students (with\nthe correlative shift away from dependence\ntowards independence) are, in my view, to be\nnourished - provided that they show potential\nfor increasing educational effectiveness (and, as\na secondary consideration, efficiency). This\nbook makes a positive contribution in this\nrespect.\nProblem-based learning (PBL) inverts the\nstandard type of curriculum in higher education.\nInstead of providing units of study which can be\nused as building-blocks in multidimensional\n'capstone' activities such as projects and\ndissertations, it faces students from the start with\nsituations that can only be resolved through\ntheir active involvement in searching out\nrelevant material from a variety of sources, only\none of which is the tutor. In that sense, PBL is\nvery much in the tradition of resource-based\nlearning - a mode which is on the threshojd of a\nnew lease of life because of the increasing\navailability of information in electronic form.\nHowever, PBL is far wider in its range than the\nacquisition and transformation of information:\nproblems in the world outside academe are\n'messy', often lacking clear boundaries, and\nrequiring the solver(s) to exhibit the wide range\nof intellectual, practical and social skills that is\nembodied in the notion of 'capability\"\n(Stephenson and Weil, 1992).\nThe book comprises 33 chapters which are\ndistributed between six parts. Part I deals with\nthe nature of PBL; Part II with getting started;\nPart III with design and implementation; and\nPart V with the assessment of students and the\nevaluation of programmes. Part IV provides a\nnumber of examples from different professions;\nand Part VI seeks to address the issue of how\nPBL might develop.\nThe book (wittingly\/wittily?) requires readers to\npursue a PBL strategy if they are to work\ntowards the development of PBL in their own\ninstitutions: there is no standard recipe on offer\n- rather, the bulk of the book consists of a series\nof experiences and ideas that have been written\ndown by practitioners. Some have basically\nadopted models from elsewhere; others have\ngone in for more adaptation and redesign in\n118\norder to satisfy their own institution's needs. If\nreaders are seriously considering PBL, they will\nneed to read the whole book in order to extract\nthe necessary ideas and experiences. Here the\nlarge number of short chapters is a\ndisadvantage: I found myself wanting much\nmore detail than some chapters were able\n(allowed?) to provide, yet some details were\nrepeated in different chapters.. Those who are\ninterested in particular angles on PBL will\nprobably need to consult the original (and fuller)\nsources quoted in the chapters' bibliographies.\nIn deciding whether or not to opt for PBL, the\npotential user has to bear in mind the\ncharacteristics of the entering students. Those\nwho have little or no experience of PBL may find\na PBL-based programme of study to be dis-\nconcerting. The medical students at McMaster\nUniversity, whose PBL-based programme is\nwell-established and has clearly influenced many\nof the contributors, have at least a bachelor's\ndegree (and many have more advanced degrees),\nand so could be expected to have acquired\nbeforehand the skills of searching out and\nprocessing information relevant to the problems\nbeing set. School leavers, on the other hand, will\nalmost certainly have had much less opportunity\nto develop the requisite skills.\nLikewise, the skills of staff may need to be\ndeveloped if a PBL-based curriculum is to be\nsoundly underpinned. Chapter 16 outlines the\nmultiplicity of roles that fall to the tutor on a\nPBL-based programme, and is likely to provoke\nthought in those who teach on more conven-\ntional programmes. The shift in perspective from\ntraditional teaching approaches is profound, and\nrequires that hearts and minds be positively\nengaged well before any change to PBL is set in\ntrain (whether for whole programmes or part-\nprogrammes). Academic leadership and\nmanagement are of vital importance here. One\nshould not overlook institutional politics: an\ninnovation not supported as fully as it might\nhave been may find difficulty in succeeding, as\nthe case study of the introduction of the BInf at\nGriffith University (Chapter 9) suggests.\nPart VI is the least strong component of the\nbook: 'Beyond problem-based learning' hints to\nthe reader that, after the long journey through\nthe preceding 307 pages, there is a further peak\nto be scaled, a new and greater truth to be\nrevealed. The reader is likely to be disappointed,\nfor the three chapters seem to be taking steps\nbackward, dealing with matters that could easily\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nhave been incorporated into a critical discussion\nat the beginning of the book of what PBL can\nand cannot reasonably be expected to achieve. I\nwould have preferred the editors to have been\nbolder here, and to have speculated on the ways\nin which PBL might be developed for curricula\nthat are much less professionally oriented in\ncharacter than is typical of the genre. If, as I\nbelieve, the precepts of PBL are consistent with\nthe notion of 'capability', there is scope for\nconsidering - in' a time in which higher\neducation is increasingly being expected to\ndevelop in students skills appropriate to the\nworld outside academia - the contribution that\nPBL can make across the full span of\nprogrammes running in higher education.\nBoud and Feletti's book is a rewarding read,\nthough its structure does require a measure of\ndetermination on the part of the reader jf he or\nshe is fully to benefit from what is on offer. I\nwould have preferred fewer, but deeper, chapters\nwith the institutional exemplars as exhibits\nrather than as full chapters, since that would\nhave made the 'messages' easier for hard-pressed\nacademics to extract - a matter of importance, if\nthe aim of the book is to encourage the greater\nuse of PBL.\nMantz Yorke, Liverpool John Moores University\nReference\nStephenson J. and Weil S.
