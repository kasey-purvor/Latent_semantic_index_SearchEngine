Brand equity was \nconceptualized as related to the level of social benefit offered by each brand and was \nmeasured with a simple questionnaire that asked consumers to rate brands with respect \nto their familiarity and quality levels. These measures were then related to brand market \nshare and revenue. Results showed that the relation between consumer-based brand \nequity and brand performance varies across product categories, indicating that products \ndiffer with respect to their level of brandability and suggesting ways to measure it. \n 2 \nBrand equity has been one of the most popular and potentially important \nmarketing concepts since the 1980s (cf. Keller, 1998). Its relevance is related to the \nrecognition that branding is often essential to firm success, particularly in highly \ncompetitive business environments, and may become one of the most valuable assets of \nfirms. As a consequence, marketing and advertising companies have given increased \nemphasis to brand equity, by creating, for example, the position of brand equity \nmanager, while consulting practices have developed methods to measure and track \nbrand equity (cf. Ailawadi, Lehmann, & Neslin, 2003). In the academic literature, \ndifferent definitions and models have been proposed, most of which following cognitive \nframeworks that attempt to predict brand purchasing (or intention to purchase) on the \nbasis of what consumers know and believe about the brand. The main interest is usually \nto identify the cognitive processes involved in this prediction, independently of context. \nAs strategic tool, however, this focus on branding raises the question of when should a \ncompany invest in building brand equity, for it seems unreasonable to assume that this \nis the best strategy to follow independently of context. Branding seems to be relevant \nparticularly in the context of product categories. As a preliminary attempt to answer this \nquestion, the purpose of the present paper was to examine the relation between \ncustomer-based brand equity and brand performance in several supermarket product \ncategories. In order to do so, a simple, theoretically consistent, measure of consumer-\nbased brand equity was adopted. The measure was developed in the context of the \nbehavioral perspective model of consumer behavior which may complement cognitive \nmodels by emphasizing the influence of situational variables, in the present case, the \nproduct category.  \n \n \n 3 \nCONSUMER-BASED BRAND EQUITY \nIn the last two decades, a growing amount of attention has been devoted by \npractitioners and academics to the conceptualization, measurement and management of \nbrand equity (e.g., Aaker, 1991, 1996; Aaker & Keller, 1990; Ailawadi et al., 2003; \nErdem, Swait, & Valenzuela, 2006; Keller, 1993, 1998; Netemeyer et al., 2004), \nresulting in \u201cseveral often-divergent view-points on the dimensions of brand equity, the \nfactors that influence it, the perspectives from which it should be studied, and the ways \nto measure it\u201d (Ailawadi et al., 2003, p. 1). Despite the divergence of opinions and \nperspectives, a reasonable agreement concerning the definition of brand equity has been \nreached, which, in general sense, \u201cis defined in terms of the marketing effects uniquely \nattributable to the brand\u2014for example, when certain outcomes result from the \nmarketing of a product or service because of its brand name that would not occur if the \nsame product or service did not have that name\u201d (Keller, 1993, p. 1). The specific \nmarketing effects related to brand equity can be analyzed at the level of firm outcomes, \nsuch as brand market share, revenue, and premium prices, or at the consumer level, such \nas consumer\u2019s brand knowledge, image, awareness and attitudes. These two levels of \nanalyses are clearly linked because changes in firm outcomes, such as sales volume and \nprofit, are usually aggregated consequence of consumer-based brand equity, such as \nbrand image and attitude (cf. Ailawadi et al., 2003; Keller, 1998). Due to this relevance \nto strategic managerial decisions, much effort has been put into defining and measuring \nconsumer-based brand equity. \n Two influential frameworks were proposed by Aaker (1996) and Keller (1993). \nAaker proposed ten measures of brand equity, divided into five categories, four of \nwhich are related to consumer-based equity and one category that includes market \nperformance measures. The four consumer-based categories are loyalty (including \n 4 \nwillingness to pay price premium and satisfaction), perceived quality (including \nperceived quality and leadership), differentiation (perceived value, brand personality, \norganizational associations), and brand awareness. Keller proposed that brand equity \ndepends primarily on brand knowledge, conceptualized according to an associative \nnetwork memory model in terms of two components, brand awareness (i.e., recognition \nand recall) and brand image (e.g., associations related to attributes, benefits and \nattitudes).  \n More recently, Netemeyer et al. (2004) presented a model containing four core \nor primary facets of consumer-based brand equity: perceived quality, perceived value \nfor cost, and brand uniqueness, which would influence purchase intention and behavior \nthrough the mediation of a fourth construct, the willingness to pay a price premium. The \nmodel also included secondary facets of consumer-based brand equity, such as brand \nawareness, familiarity, and popularity. The authors conducted four empirical \ninvestigations to test different aspects of the model, including its predictive validity with \nrespect to purchase behavior. Their results indicated that the best predictors of future \nbehavior were perceived quality of the brand, which could not be distinguished from \nperceived value for cost, and brand uniqueness, whose influence on purchase behavior \nwas found to be mediated by the willingness to pay a price premium.  \nAnother line of research has cast doubts about the relevance of uniqueness or \ndistinctiveness in predicting consumers\u2019 preferences. Romaniuk, Ehrenberg, and Sharp \n(2004) investigated whether consumers\u2019 considered the brand that they purchased as \ndifferent, distinct, original or unique. Data were collected in two countries (USA and \nUK) based on different survey methods (telephone and questionnaire) and covered 13 \ndifferent product categories, ranging from soft drinks to computers. Results showed that \nonly 10% of consumers associated the brand they bought with any one of the adjectives, \n 5 \n50% of consumers did not associate the purchased brand with any of the adjectives, and \nthese percentages varied little from brand to brand. The authors concluded that \ndifferences in brand performance seem to be related to their levels of salience or \nawareness rather than based upon brand differentiation.  \nTaken together, these studies suggest that, although there is no clear agreement \nconcerning the dimensions of brand equity, most existing models seem to agree that at \nleast brand quality and brand awareness should be included. When one considers the \ndifficulties associated with using what consumers say about what they would spend and \nwhat they actually spend, the willingness to pay a price premium, also included in \nseveral proposal, would be more accurately assessed by actual prices found in the \nmarketplace, which would make this construct more closely related to firm outcomes \nthan to consumer perceptions (Ailawadi et al., 2003). The suggestion that this construct \nfunctions as mediator between consumer-based facets and consumer\u2019s intention (cf. \nNetemeyer at al., 2004) is an indication that the construct should not be interpreted as \nbelonging to the same level as the other consumer-based dimensions. In fact, some \nrecent proposal of brand equity measure based upon market outcomes, such as revenue \npremium, depends heavily on the possibility of charging a price premium for the brand \n(cf. Ailawadi et al., 2003). \nA behavioral perspective approach to consumer behavior may provide a \ntheoretical consistent alternative for conceptualizing consumer-based brand equity, \nwhich would include variables related to brand quality and brand awareness, and would \nemphasize the role of situational and contextual variables. This viewpoint will now be \nexplored.  \n \n \n 6 \n \nA BEHAVIORAL INTERPRETATION OF CONSUMER CHOICE \n The area of consumer research has been dominated by social-cognitive theories, \nwhich assume that cognitive constructs, such as attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs, \ninfluence consumers\u2019 intention of purchasing products and services, which, in turn, \ninfluences what consumers do. The previously mentioned frameworks of consumer-\nbased brand equity well illustrate this tendency well.  One of the problems with this \ntype of approach is the low correlation between attitudes and behavior, repeatedly \nreported and discussed in the literature (e.g., Wicker, 1969; Glasman & Albarracin, \n2006). Moreover, it has been shown that the strength of the relation between attitude \nand behavior increases when situational and behavioral variables are taken into \nconsideration, a finding that points to another problem with cognitive approach, namely, \nthe little emphasis they give to the possible influence of such variables (cf. Foxall, 1997, \n2005). According to some epistemologists, the excessive dominance of social-cognitive \ntheorizing may also hinder the progress of the field, for scientific development seems to \ndepend on diversity of ideas, on opposing, incompatible views strongly held by \ndifferent research groups (cf. Feyerabend, 1993). \nThese limitations associated with social-cognitive approaches led Foxall (1990; \n1997; 2005) to propose the Behavioral Perspective Model (BPM) to interpret and \nexplain consumer behavior. According to this model, consumer behavior occurs at the \nintersection of the consumer\u2019s learning history and the current behavior setting, that is, \nat the consumer situation. Thus, the BPM provides an environmental perspective to \nconsumer behavior and hence includes situational influences into the analysis of \npurchase and consumption. In behavioral terms, consumer behavior, the dependent \nvariable, is a function of the individual\u2019s learning history related to a given type of \n 7 \nconsumption, the behavior setting and the consequences the behavior produces. Figure 1 \ncombines all these variables to provide a general picture of the BPM. \nThe behavior setting is defined as the social and physical environment in which \nthe consumer is exposed to stimuli signaling a choice situation. A store, a theater, a \nwaiting room, or an open-air festival in a public park, are all examples of behavior \nsettings, varying in their scope and capacity of evoking consumer responses. This scope \ntranslates into a continuum between an open and a closed setting, allowing consumers \ndifferent degrees of control over their behavior. The more open setting, like for instance \nthe park festival, grants consumers to behave in a relatively free way with the option to \nwander around, talk, listen to music, eat, drink, smoke or even leave the scene. Towards \nthe other end of the spectrum consumers are less free in their choice and are indeed \nexpected to conform to a pattern of behavior set by someone else. For example, \naccording to society\u2019s norms, patients in a surgery\u2019s waiting area are expected to sit \nquietly and wait in a patient manner until they are called for their treatment. Of course, \nthey are free to read magazines, possibly chat with other waiting patients or walk out of \nthe surgery if the waiting time is considered too long (in which case they will not \nreceive treatment). \nThe other element of the consumer situation, the learning history, refers to the \nsimilar or related experiences a consumer has had before encountering the current \nbehavior setting. This previous experience helps the consumer to interpret the behavior \nsetting accurately by predicting the likely consequences her behavior in this situation \nwill incur. Utilitarian reinforcement refers to the direct and functional benefits the \npurchase and\/or consumption of a product (or service) involves. These are benefits \nmediated by the product or service. As an example, one of the utilitarian consequences \nof buying a car is the benefit of owning and using the products afterwards, in a purely \n 8 \nfunctional and hedonic sense, for it gives, for instance, door-to-door transportation, with \nminimum weather exposure and free time schedule. Utilitarian punishment may be \nrelated to surrendering money, time spent searching, or aversive functional \nconsequences, such as buying a product that does not work properly. Informational \nreinforcement circumscribes the more indirect and symbolic consequences of behavior, \nsuch as social consequences (e.g., social status and self-esteem). These are \nconsequences mediated by other people and function as feedback to the consumer as \nhow well he or she is performing as a consumer. The informational reinforcement of \nowning a car might be related to the social status and admiration of others, particularly \nif it is a prestigious and expensive car make (e.g., a Bentley or Mercedes). Informational \npunishment occurs when other people do not approve or criticize what the consumer \npurchased, because they do not find it aesthetically pleasing or they do not trust the \nbrand, or when the person finds out that she paid too much for the product, which may \nalso function as negative feedback. Foxall (1990) argues that all products or service \ncontain an element of utilitarian and informational reinforcement and punishment, \nwhich do vary in degree from product to product and from situation to situation.  \nThus, the probability of purchase and consumption depends on the relative weight of the \nreinforcing and aversive consequences that are signaled by the elements in the consumer \nbehavior setting (cf. Alhadeff, 1982). \nAccording to this view, product, brand, and service attributes, including price, \nmay be interpreted as programmed reinforcing (i.e., benefits) and aversive events. \nManufacturers, retailers, and brand managers direct all their efforts to modifying and \nshaping the reinforcing and aversive properties of the attributes of their products and \nbrands, so as to make them more attractive to the consumer. Branding, promotional \nactivities, new product development and product selection are just a few options open to \n 9 \nthe supply side. These endeavors may or may not work, and this is why they ought to be \ninterpreted as programmed reinforcing (or aversive) events rather then actual \nreinforcing (or aversive) events. According to this theoretical perspective, one of the \nmain tasks in marketing is to identify what events can function as benefits (or aversive \nstimuli), to what extent, for what consumers, and under what circumstances (Foxall, \n1992). \n \nA BEHAVIORAL INTERPRETATION OF CONSUMER-BASED BRAND EQUITY \nThe BPM can provide a consistent interpretation of branding. Positive brand \nequity would increase with increases in the level of utilitarian and informational \nreinforcing consequences of purchasing a giving brand, whereas negative consumer-\nbased brand equity would increase with increases in the level of utilitarian and \ninformational punishing consequences. In previous investigations (cf. Foxall, Oliveira-\nCastro, & Schrezenmaier, 2004; Oliveira-Castro, Foxall, & Schrezenmaier, 2005), \nbased on consumer panel data, brands were ranked according to two levels of utilitarian \nbenefit and three levels of informational benefit. Benefit levels were ranked based on \nthe interpretation that brands represent programmed reinforcement contingencies \narranged by managers and producers. In the marketing context of routinely-bought \nsupermarket food products, higher levels of utilitarian benefit can be identified by the \naddition of (supposedly) desirable attributes. These attributes are considered to have \nvalue-adding qualities for the product or its consumption, they are visibly declared on \nthe package or are part of the product name, and ultimately justify higher prices. \nMoreover, in most cases, several general brands offer product varieties with and without \nthese attributes. In Foxall et al.\u2019s (2004), utilitarian levels were assigned based on \nadditional attributes (e.g., plain baked beans vs. baked beans with sausage) and\/or \n 10 \ndifferentiated types of products (e.g., plain cookies vs. chocolate chip cookies). In the \ncase of differentiated product types, several manufacturers tend to offer the different \nproduct types at differentiated prices (e.g., plain cookies were cheaper than more \nelaborate cookies for all brands examined). \nBy contrast, informational reinforcement can be linked to brand name, brand \ndifferentiation, and such like, perhaps more closely to branding and brand equity, which \nin turn is usually also related to price differentiation, because the most promoted and \nbest known brands tend to be related to higher levels of prestige, social status, and \ntrustworthiness. As an example, when comparing the levels of brand differentiation of \nTesco Value and Kellogg\u2019s Cornflakes, Kellogg\u2019s is clearly the better known, more \ndifferentiated and also more expensive brand, with a higher programmed level of \ninformational reinforcement. This type of variation among brands has been translated \ninto different levels of informational reinforcement. It should be noted that the \nclassification of informational reinforcement levels does not rule out the possibility of \nthere also being different degrees of utilitarian reinforcement between two informational \nlevels (cf. Foxall et al., 2004). Because brands usually have almost identical \nformulations (cf. Ehrenberg, 1988; Foxall, 1999), the ranking of informational \nreinforcement was based on the predominant, more obvious differences between brands. \nIn fact, there is evidence that consumers may not even be able to distinguish between \nbrands of one product category on the basis of their physical characteristics (e.g., in \nblind tests). In Foxall et al.\u2019s (2004) study, the following criteria were the basis for \ndetermining the different levels of informational reinforcement: 1) increases in prices \nacross brands for the same product type (e.g., plain baked beans, plain cookies or plain \ncornflakes) were considered to be indicative of differences in informational levels; 2) \nthe cheapest store brands (e.g., Asda Smart Price, Tesco Value, Sainsbury Economy) \n 11 \nwere considered to represent the lowest informational level (Level 1); 3) store brands \nwithout the add-on good value for money or economy (e.g., Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury) \nand cheapest specialized brands were thought to embody the medium informational \nlevel (Level 2); and 4) higher-priced, specialized brands (e.g., Heinz, McVities, \nKelloggs, Lurpak), were assigned to Level 3, the highest informational level. \nThe classification of brands on the basis of utilitarian and informational benefits \nthey offer to consumers opened the way to several interesting findings related to \nconsumer brand choice. The authors found, for example, that: 1) most consumers make \ntheir purchases within brands belonging to the same level of informational and \nutilitarian reinforcement (Foxall et al., 2004); and 2) consumers change the quantity \nthey buy on each shopping occasion (i.e., demand elasticity) as a function of changes in \nprices of the particular brand, changes in the level of utilitarian reinforcement across \nbrands, and changes in the level of informational reinforcement across brands, in this \norder of importance. \nIn the case of frequently purchased packaged goods, where utilitarian level tend \nto be similar across brands, because product formulation is almost identical across \nbrands and most (large) brands offer several versions within each product category \n(most cookie brands offer rich-tea and chocolate-chip cookies), brand equity would be \nmore closely related to informational benefit. This is compatible with Farquhar\u2019s (1989) \nposition that \u201ca brand enhances the value of a product beyond its functional purpose\u201d (p. \n25). Considering that informational benefit, according to the BPM, is social and related \nto feedback received by the consumer concerning his or her behavior as consumer, one \nway of measuring informational reinforcement would be to probe the programmed \nsocial contingencies by examining which brands would be considered by the social \nenvironment as \u201cgood\u201d brands. There would be higher probabilities and larger \n 12 \nmagnitudes of social reinforcement programmed for buying the \u201cgood\u201d brands than the \nothers. This would provide, based upon the BPM, a theoretical consistent interpretation \nof customer-based brand equity often measured on the basis of surveys. When one asks \nlarge numbers of people to evaluate different brands with respect to their quality, \nfamiliarity, differentiation, and all the other commonly investigated dimensions, the \nperson is probing the programmed social contingencies for buying in that particular \nproduct category or market. Brand names, logos, packages, and such like, would be \ninterpreted as events in the consumer-behavior setting that signal, based upon each \nconsumer\u2019s history, the likelihood and magnitude of informational (and utilitarian, \ndepending on the product) reinforcement. According to this approach, customer-based \nbrand equity can be measured by asking consumers in general about brands, who are not \nnecessarily the same consumers whose buying behavior the researcher is investigating. \nConsumers, in most cases, can tell which are the best brands in a given market, even if \nthey have no intention of purchasing them because they cannot afford them, do not like \nthem, are not sensitive to social reinforcement, do not consume such product, or such \nlike. In this sense, the present interpretation is in part similar to the type of brand equity \nevaluation conducted by large consultancy firms (e.g., Young and Rubicam\u2019s Brand \nAsset Valuator, and Interbrand). \nThis behavioral approach may complement the typical interpretation provided by \ncognitive models, where the main purpose is to predict purchase or intention to \npurchase a certain brand given that the consumer has certain knowledge or belief about \nthe brand. In typical cognitively-oriented investigations, the same consumer answer \nquestions about the brand and about the intention of buying the brand (or is observed \nactually buying it). This is usually done independently of the context or situation where \nconsumption occurs, for the main focus of the approach is to identify the cognitive \n 13 \nprocesses involved in brand choice in any context. In order to achieve this, such \ninvestigations conceive brand equity across different product categories (e.g., Aaker, \n1996; Ailawadi et al., 2003; Keller, 1993; Netemeyer et al., 2004), where a good model \nof consumer-based brand equity would have to show high correlations between \nconsumers\u2019 knowledge or beliefs about the brand and their intention to purchase (or \nactual purchase) across product categories. A behavioral approach would emphasize the \npossible influence of situational and contextual variables, whose effect has been \nextensively demonstrated to increase the correlation between other cognitive constructs, \nsuch as attitudes, and behavior (cf. Foxall, 1997; 2005). \nThe primary context of brands is their product category. Therefore, one way of \nlocating consumer-based brand equity in space and time (cf. Foxall, 1997) is to \ninvestigate the efficacy of programmed informational reinforcement in different product \ncategories. Following this line of reasoning, in the present paper, consumer-based brand \nequity was measured with the use of a questionnaire which asked consumers to rate the \nquality and knowledge (how well known is the brand) levels of each brand  in a product \ncategory. With the purpose of examining in which product categories may be worth \ninvesting in branding, this consumer-based equity measure was related to measures of \nbrand performance, such as market share and average price, in eleven supermarket \nproduct categories in Brazil (Study 1) and four categories in the United Kingdom (Study \n2).  \n \nSTUDY 1  \nData Collection \n Two sets of data were used, both collected in Brazil. One of them, related to the \nmeasure of brand equity, was based on the application of a questionnaire. The other set \n 14 \nof data, from which brand performance measures were obtained, was based on \nobservational data from research that investigates search behavior. All data were \ncollected from May 2003 to September 2005. For each specific product category, \nobservational and questionnaire data collection periods were not separated by more than \ntwo months.  \nQuestionnaire data and measure of brand equity. Brazilian consumers, men and \nwomen, selected on the basis of convenience, answered the questionnaire. Their overall \naverage age was 40. Table 1 shows the number of consumers that answered the \nquestionnaire in each of the 11 product categories. A simple questionnaire was used, \nwhere respondents were asked to rate brands in each product category. The \nquestionnaire contained a list of all the brands found in the investigated supermarkets \nduring the time of the search behavior research (see next section). For each brand listed, \nconsumers were asked to answer the following two questions (originally in Portuguese): \n1) Is the brand well known? (0 - Not known at all, 1- Known a little, 2 - Quite well \nknown, 3 - Very well known); and 2) What is the level of quality of the brand? (0 - \nUnknown quality, 1 - Low quality, 2 - Medium quality, 3 - High quality). Four \nquestionnaires containing questions about different products were used. One of the \nquestionnaires was responded by the same group of 128 consumers and contained \nquestions about instant chocolate (8 brands), fabric conditioner (12), washing-up liquid \n(10), black beans (12), canned sweet corn (11), and soybean oil (12). Another \nquestionnaire, containing questions about coffee (19), margarine (13) and laundry \nwashing powder (16), was responded by a group of 171 consumers (170 of which did it \nfor laundry powder). A third questionnaire containing questions about mayonnaise (13) \nwas answered by a group of 157 consumers, and a fourth one, containing information \nabout cookies (25, only sweet cookies), was responded by different 148 consumers. \n 15 \nAlthough the two answers to the questions were expected to be highly correlated, both \nof them were used because there was the possibility of there existing well known brands \nthat have low quality (e.g., popularly positioned brands). In order to obtain one brand \nequity score for each brand, mean score for knowledge and quality was calculated for \neach consumer and for each brand. The average of these mean values when then \ncalculated for each brand across all consumers, referred to as MKQ hereafter. Brand \nsubtypes that differed with respect to utilitarian attributes, such as varied formulations \nof the same brand of laundry washing powder or of coffee or different flagrances of \nwashing-up liquids, were grouped within the same brand name. \nObservational data and measure of brand performance. Measures of brand \nperformance were obtained from a research project that investigates search behavior for \nsupermarket products using direct observations. In this type of research, search duration \nwas measured by observing the time consumers spent between looking at a given \nproduct on the shelves until they put the selected product in the cart (e.g., Oliveira-\nCastro, 2003). Consumers were observed in the absence of any selection criterion as \nthey approached the products, generating almost random samples of product sales. \nObservations were conducted in loco or with the aid of cameras in several stores of two \nbrands of large national supermarkets (similar to Asda and Tesco Extra) and of one \nbrand of medium-sized, regional supermarket. As many observations of different \nconsumers buying different product categories were conducted and information \nconcerning brands, quantities and prices were recorded, it was possible to derive brand \nperformance measures, such as market share, from such data. Although such data \ncannot be assumed to be as accurate as those stemming from market research conducted \nby commercial firms (e.g., ACNielsen), they may serve as reasonable proxies. Market \nshare, average price, and total revenue (market share multiplied by average price) were \n 16 \ncalculated for each brand included in the observational data. The numbers of \nobservations for instant chocolate, fabric conditioner, washing-up liquid, black beans, \ncanned sweet corn, soybean oil, coffee, margarine, laundry washing powder, \nmayonnaise, and cookies, were 169, 255, 304, 276, 151, 449, 725, 367, 355, 145, and \n560, respectively. \n \nResults and Discussion \nThe values of MKQ varied from .03 to 2.95 across all brands in all product \ncategories. For all products, maximum values of MKQ were higher than 2.40, with the \nexception of black beans, for which the maximum value was equal to 1.83. Figure 2 \nshows market share as a function of MKQ for each product category. As can be seen in \nthe figure, market shares increased with increases in MKQ for most product categories, \nwith the possible exceptions of black beans, sweet corn and cookies. Figure 3 shows \nmarket share as a function of average brand price for each product category. Market \nshares do not seem to have changed systematically with increases in average brand \nprice, for most product categories. The possible exceptions were sweet corn, soybean oil \nand, perhaps, cookies, where there were apparent decreases in market shares, and for \nmayonnaise, where there might have been an increase in market share associated to \nincreases in brand average price.  \n In order to test if such apparent changes were linearly statistically significant, \nmultiple regression analyses of market share as a function of MKQ and average brand \nprices were calculated for each product category. Table 1 shows the values of R\n2\n, \nconstant (a), and coefficients associated with MKQ and average brand price with their \nrespective standard errors and values of p. Values of R\n2 \nvaried from .068 to .834 and \nwere higher than .300 for 9 of the 11 products. Values of bMKQ were all positive and \n 17 \nwere significant (.05) for seven of the products, showing that for these products market \nshare increased significantly with increases in MKQ. The exceptions were black beans, \nsweet corn, soybean oil and washing powder. In the case of washing powder, the value \nof p was very close to the adopted significance level, which may have been related to \nsample size. Even among products for which the values of bMKQ were significant, these \nvalues varied from 1.82, for cookies, to 20.87, for instant chocolate, showing that the \nlevel of influence of consumer-brand equity upon brand performance varies greatly \nacross product categories. Values of The values of bprice were negative for nine products \nbut were significant only for two products, fabric conditioner and cookies. This value \nwas very close to significance level in the case of black beans. \nTaken together, these results indicate that, for five of the products, increases in \nmarket share were significantly related to increases in MKQ and not to price. \nConsidering that brands with higher MKQ usually also charge higher average prices, \nincreases in MKQ may be associated with positively accelerated increases in brand \nrevenue. In order to test this possibility, the fit of three equations relating total revenue \n(i.e., market share multiplied by price) to MKQ were examined. The equations tested \nwere linear, power and exponential, and the results showed that they were significant \nfor seven, four and eight products, respectively. The exponential equation showed the \nlargest r\n2\n for seven of the products, confirming the suggestion that increases in MKQ \nwere related to positively accelerated increases in brand revenue for most products. \nOne possible shortcoming related to the results of the present study is the source \nof data used to derive brand performance measures, that is, market share and average \nprice. These were based on data stemming from observational research that considered \nvaried numbers of observations, ranging from 145 to 725. Although these can be \ninterpreted as proxy measures of brand performance, larger samples of observations \n 18 \nwould probably improve their reliability level. Despite such small sample for such \nmeasures, the results serve to illustrate a methodology that can be used to examine the \npossible relations between brand equity and brand performance in different contexts. \nStudy 2 used much larger samples to derive brand performance measures and a simpler \nprocedure to measure consumer-based brand equity.  \n \nSTUDY 2 \nData Collection \nTwo sets of data were also used, both collected in the United Kingdom. One of \nthem, related to the measure of brand equity, was based on the application of a \nquestionnaire. The other set of data, from which brand performance measures were \nobtained, was based on a consumer panel. \nQuestionnaire data and measure of brand equity. An English version of the \nquestionnaire used in Study 1 was adopted. Consumers who were living in the UK for \nmost of their lives were selected on a convenience basis and asked to answer one or \nmore questionnaires. In this study, in order to measure brand equity, small samples of \n\u201cexpert\u201d consumers were used instead of the larger samples used in the Brazilian. This \nwas done with the purpose of developing a more practical and cheaper measure of brand \nequity. Four questionnaires were used, one for each of the products investigated, \nnamely, cookies (\u201cbiscuits\u201d in the UK, incorporating savory and sweet), fruit juice, \nbaked beans and yellow fats (incorporating margarine, butter and spreads). These \nproducts were selected because they were the ones for which consumer panel data were \navailable. Each questionnaire included for each product all the brands purchased by the \nsample of consumers in the panel, after filtering for attributes that are more related to \nutilitarian benefits rather than informational benefits. Then, because they are interpreted \n 19 \nas utilitarian attributes, different pack sizes and different product formulations (e.g., \nplain baked beans vs. baked beans with sausage; rich tea cookies vs. chocolate chips \ncookies; plain baked beans vs. organic) were all classified as the same brand. Brand \nnames that belonged to a more general brand but differed with respect to their \npositioning were classified as different brands (e.g., Asda vs. Asda Smart Price; Tesco \nvs. Tesco Value). The same group of consumers answered the questionnaires about \nbaked beans (23 respondents), fruit juice (22 respondents) and yellow fats (22 \nrespondents), whereas another group (33 respondents) answered the questionnaire about \ncookies. The main reason for this separation was the number of brands in each category. \nThe questionnaire for cookies included 315 brands, whereas for baked beans, fruit juice \nand yellow fats, the numbers of brands were 45, 99 and 89, respectively. Data were \ncollected in October and November 2006. Brand equity scores were obtained following \nthe same procedure adopted in Study 1 (i.e., mean score for knowledge and quality, \nMKQ, calculated for each brand across all consumers). Due to the small samples sizes, \nwhen compared to the Brazilian, reliability analyses of brand equity scores were \nconducted. In order to do so, respondents were randomly divided into two or three (in \nthe case of cookies) groups of approximately equal sizes, whose average MKQ given to \neach brand were correlated (Pearson) across all brands (N ranged from 45, for baked \nbeans, to 315, for cookies). Correlation coefficients between scores obtained by pairs of \ngroups, three pairs for cookies and one for each of the other products, ranged from .872 \nto .984, showing good reliability.  \nPanel data and measure of brand performance. Consumer panel data were \nobtained from ACNielsen HomescanTM which, at the period of this research, included \ndata from 10,000 households in Great Britain. Each home uses a barcode scanner to \nrecord their purchases. The panel was regionally and demographically balanced to \n 20 \nrepresent the household population. The data set used included information about four \nproduct categories during 52 weeks from July 2004 to July 2005, from households that \npurchased the product at least seven times during the period. Market share, average \nprice, and total revenue (market share multiplied by average price) were calculated for \neach brand and were based on the total number of purchases of each product included in \nthe panel data, that is, 13,729 purchases by 832 consumers for baked beans, 75,847 by \n1594 consumers for cookies, 21,400 by 895 consumers for fruit juice, and 30,906 by \n1354 consumers for yellow fats.  \n \nResults and Discussion \nThe values of MKQ varied from .00 to 2.96 across all brands in all four product \ncategories. For all products, maximum values of MKQ were higher than 2.55. Figure 4 \nshows market share as a function of MKQ for each product category. As can be seen in \nthe figure, market shares increased with increases in MKQ for all product categories. \nFigure 5 shows market share as a function of average brand price for each product \ncategory. Visually, for only two products, cookies and fruit juice, market shares seem to \nhave decreased with increases in average brand price, although such decreases were \naccompanied by high levels of variability.  \n As in Study 1, multiple regression analyses of market share as a function of \nMKQ and average brand prices were calculated for each product category with the \npurpose of testing if such apparent changes were statistically significant. Table 2 shows \nthe obtained parameters. Values of r\n2 \nvaried from .219 to .450. Values of bMKQ  were all \npositive and were significant (.05) for all products, showing that market share increased \nsignificantly with increases in MKQ. Values of bMKQ  ranged from .75 to 5.00 indicating \nthat the influence of consumer-based brand equity upon brand performance differed \n 21 \nreasonably across products. The values of bprice were negative for three products but \nwere not statistically significant, suggesting that changes in prices were not significantly \nrelated to changes in market share (at least not linearly). \nThese results indicate that increases in market share were significantly related to \nincreases in MKQ and not to price, which suggest that increases in MKQ may be \nassociated with positively accelerated increases in brand revenue. As in Study 1, the \ngoodness of fitness of different equations was examined with the purpose of testing this. \nHowever, because in Study 2 MKQ for some brands in each product category was equal \nto zero, the power function was not used. So, only linear and exponential equations \nwere used, where revenue was a function of MKQ. Although both equations showed \nstatistically significant fit for all products, r\n2\n for all products was higher for the \nexponential function, confirming the suggestion that increases in MKQ were related to \npositively accelerated increases in brand revenue. \n \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \n The purpose of the present paper is to examine if the relations between \nconsumer-based brand equity and measures of brand performance are dependent upon \nthe product category. In order to do this, these relations were examined in eleven \ndifferent product categories of supermarket products in Brazil and in four in the UK. \nThis research question was inspired by a behavioral framework that emphasizes the \npossible influence of contextual and situational variables. The approach may \ncomplement more typical cognitive models that attempt to identify possible relations \namong cognitive constructs, independently of the context where behavior takes place. \nThe measures of consumer brand-equity and brand performance were obtained from \ndifferent samples of consumers. This procedure prevents possible correlations stemming \n 22 \nfrom investigating the same consumers at two different moments and makes the \nmethodology and results applicable to existing markets. Consumer-based brand equity \nwas assessed with the use of a simple questionnaire that asked consumers to rate brands \naccording to how well they were known and their level of quality. This kind of measure \nis consistent with a behavioral interpretation, according to which consumer-based brand \nequity, particularly in the case of frequently purchased packaged products, is akin to \ninformational or social reinforcement, such as status and positive feedback, derived \nfrom purchasing products and services. Higher levels of social reinforcement would be \nprogrammed for buying brands that are well known by other consumers in general and \nconsidered by them to have high quality. But the effect of social reinforcement will \ndepend on the context, the consumer-setting (where consumption-related behavior \noccurs). Therefore, even if the consumers can identify potential sources of social \nreinforcement, depending on the context this may have little effect. \n Results showed that for all products (except perhaps for black beans) the \nmeasure of brand equity varied considerably across brands, indicating that they differed \nwith respect to how consumers evaluated how well-known they are and their level of \nquality. Despite this variation, brand performance measures did not change similarly \nacross products. Increases in market share were significantly associated to increases in \nconsumer-brand equity for eleven, out of fifteen, product categories and to decreases in \naverage brand price for only two products. For four product categories, market share \nwas not significantly related to changes in consumer-brand equity or in price. For \neleven products, total brand revenue seemed to be a positively accelerated function of \nincreases in consumer-brand equity. \n These results suggest the possibility of using equation coefficients, such as bMKQ, \nto measure the level of brandability of different product categories. Brandability can be \n 23 \ninterpreted as how much branding influences consumer behavior and, consequently, \nbrand performance in each product category. This conceptual approach may substitute \nthe general dichotomous division of products into simple commodities or branded goods \nfor a continuous dimension of brandability, which could be assessed for each product \ncategory. Rather than asking whether a product category is brandable or not, the \nquestion would be how much the product is brandable. Comparing the products \ninvestigated here, it is apparent, for example, that instant chocolate and fabric \nconditioner are much more brandable in Brazil than black beans and cookies, whereas \ncookies are less brandable than baked beans in the UK. \n Taken together, such results demonstrate that the relations between consumer-\nbased brand equity and brand performance depend upon the context in which they \noccur. This corroborates the argument in favor of emphasizing the influence of \nsituational variables, locating behavior in space and time, in consumer research, as \nexpounded by a behavioral interpretation (cf. Foxall, 1997).This interpretation is not \nincompatible with more typical cognitive ones (e.g., Aaker, 1996; Keller, 1993; \nNetemeyer et al., 2004), but differs from those with respect to the level of analysis of \nthe phenomena. In the typical cognitive approach, the main question of interest is to \nidentify which of several consumer responses to a questionnaire are correlated to the \nsame consumer\u2019s intention to buy or buying behavior. The hope is to identify a \npsychological construct that predicts and explains consumers\u2019 response (intention or \nbehavior) to a brand, which, almost independently of context, will work. Asking the \nquestions to the same consumers may suggest that if they know and think highly about \nthe brand, then they will buy it. The present research demonstrates that this is not \nnecessarily so, for it would depend upon the context. The main context for branding is \nthe product category itself, where although some brands may be better known and \n 24 \nperceived as having higher quality than others, consumers may not buy it more. In other \nwords, the cognitive explanation can tell you that if the consumer knows the brand, \nthinks highly of it, and so on, he or she is more likely to buy it. But it cannot tell you \nwhen this will happen. The behavioral approach presented here shows how one can \nidentify when these relations will hold. \n The results also illustrate how the BPM can provide a theoretically consistent \ninterpretation of branding, associated with informational, social reinforcement. The \nproposed measure, based on a very simple questionnaire, can be used to probe \nprogrammed social contingencies of reinforcement by asking consumers in general to \nrate the brands, in a given market. The measure, although quite simple, is closely related \nto dimensions often cited in the literature which take into account knowledge and \nquality of the brand. Despite the fact that these two measures were highly correlated in \nthe present paper (r = .95, p < .000, in Study 1), it would be interesting to keep both of \nthem to avoid such rare, but real, cases where a brand becomes well known despite its \nlow quality level, as it might happen with popularly positioned brands or brands that \nhave been exposed to strong negative advertisement.  \nMethodologically, the two studies reported here are complementary. Whereas \nStudy 1 used reasonably large samples to measure brand equity but relatively small \nsamples for brand performance measures, Study 2 used relatively small samples to \nmeasure brand equity but large samples for brand performance. Despite these \nmethodological differences and the analysis of data from two countries, overall results \nwere similar, suggesting that the findings are replicable. These similar results in \ncombination with the high measurement reliability observed in Study 2 recommend the \nuse of small groups of \u201cexperts\u201d to measure brand equity rather than the survey adopted \n 25 \nin Study 1. The procedure is much cheaper and more agile, requiring one fifth or less of \nthe total number of consumers used in the survey procedure.   \n Some managerial implications can be derived from the present results. First of \nall, it is clear that it may not be worth investing in branding in certain product \ncategories, for they behave as simple commodities. This was undoubtedly the case for \nblack beans, sweet corn, and soybean oil, where despite reasonable variation in \nconsumer-based brand equity, they were not significantly related to increases in brand \nmarket share or revenue. In the case of washing powder, although there was no \nsignificant association between market share and brand equity, brand revenue increased \nexponentially, and significantly, as a function of brand equity. According to the present \napproach, investors and managers could determine the brandability of different markets. \nThey could calculate how much increase in market share can be expected with increases \nin consumer-brand equity and how much decrease in market share can be expected with \nincreases in price. This can be done by examining the bMKQ coefficients. In the case of \ncoffee, for example, the results indicate that each unity of increase in MKQ is associated \nto an increase of 11.45 per cent in market share, assuming that the relation is linear. \nThis type of information can be valuable to brand managers in planning investments in \npromotions, pricing, and other strategies. If managers can estimate how much spending \nis needed to increase brand equity and know how much market increases with brand \nequity, they can decide whether the expected increased revenue compensates possible \nproduct investments.  \n 26 \nReferences \nAaker, D.
