Wilheim,\nEducational Technology Publications,\nEnglewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA, ISBN: 0-\n87778-274-1, 1994.\nTraditionally, the development of computer-\nbased instructional materials has relied on the\nuse of programming languages and computer\nprogrammers. This has often made development\nprohibitively difficult, time-consuming and\nexpensive. It has also meant that it has been\ndifficult for enthusiastic subject experts to\ndevelop their own teaching materials. In order\nto address these problems a wide variety of\nauthoring systems have been produced which\nallow the rapid development of instructional\nmaterials by reducing the amount of low-level\ncoding necessary for their implementation. A\nproblem which arises from this proliferation,\nhowever, is that subject experts find it hard to\nidentify the best tool for a particular develop-\nment task. This book has been written\nessentially with the aim of providing potential\neducational software authors with a brief\nbackground to instructional design, an overview\nof some currently available authoring systems,\nand a means by which an informed choice of\nauthoring system can be made.\nThe preface (outlining the content and\nobjectives, of the book) is followed by the main\nbody which is divided into nine chapters. The\nfirst chapter outlines an approach to instruc-\ntional design. The method follows a traditional\nsoftware life-cycle model, though detail has\nbeen included to apply the model specifically to\nthe authoring of computer-based learning\nmaterials which may employ multimedia\ntechniques.\nChapters 2 through 8 each address a particular\nauthoring environment. The aim here is to\nprovide an overview of some of the more\npopular authoring environments namely Hyper-\nCard, ToolBook, LinkWay, Spinnaker Plus,\nAuthorware Professional, Quest and TenCore.\nAlthough each chapter is written by a different\nauthor, the topics covered within each are\nrelatively consistent. Notably, each chapter\nprovides specific examples of the authoring\nprocess, and some short illustrative code\nsegments are provided where appropriate. In\naddition, screen-shots of the types of product\nwhich may be developed using the various\nsystems are presented. This allows potential\nauthors to visualize the style of their future\nproduct even before a prototype has been\ncreated.\nThe final chapter looks at the process of\nconcurrent authoring. This is the idea that an\nauthoring tool can be made which will allow the\nseamless integration of training materials within\nany software application. In this way, training\nfacilities can be integrated into existing\ncomputer applications so that users can access\nreal-time on-the-job training. Such training can\n126\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nbe used to assist in the completion of tasks\ncurrently being undertaken, and can also be\nused within a pure training context. These just-\nin-time training techniques have become known\nas electronic performance support systems and\nthere is a growing need for tools to facilitate\ntheir production.\nTwo useful appendices are provided at the end\nof the book. The first of\" these provides a\nchecklist to assist in choosing an appropriate\nauthoring system for a particular task, and\nalthough rather simple, the checklist does detail\nsome of the important features to look out for\nwhen choosing an authoring environment. The\nsecond appendix provides a list of authoring\nsystems and addresses from which to obtain\nfurther information, or the software itself.\nAlthough useful for prospective authors of\ncomputer-based learning materials, books of\nthis kind tend to date rapidly, the result of\nconstant upgrades being made to software of all\nkinds. As a result, the authoring environment\ndescriptions which make up the bulk of the\nbook will rapidly cease to describe accurately\nthe current features and facilities offered by the\nsystems treated. It tends to be the advanced\nfeatures, which may well have a crucial impact\non the choice of authoring environment, that\nbecome outdated. Indeed, this has already\nhappened in the case of both HyperCard and\nToolBook. Nevertheless, the basic strategies\nadopted by such systems remain the same, and\ntherefore value is retained.\nStephen Richards, University of Teesside\nDesigning Instructional Text by James Hartley,\nthird edition, Kogan Page, London, ISBN 0-\n7494-1037-X, 1994.\nThis book is intended to give general guidelines\nfor the production of instructional materials.\nThree main areas are covered: the design and\nlayout of instructional materials, the language\nin which they are written, and how to evaluate\nthe finished products.\nThe first five chapters cover the traditional\ntypographic conventions which evolved before\nthe advent of the desktop-publishing era.\nFactors affecting the choice of page size, type\nsize and typeface are discussed in detail;\neffective use of white space is also described.\nFollowing the basic rules outlined in these\nchapters would enable readers to produce\nmaterials free of the amateurish horrors which\nhave become, sadly, all too familiar. One useful\naddition to this part of the book might have\nbeen a discussion of the advantages and dis-\nadvantages of different binding methods.\nChapter 6 goes on to discuss the production of\ninstructional text in terms of clarity and\norganization. Where possible, recommendations\nand conclusions are drawn from actual research\nstudies. Hartley is careful to stress the difference\nbetween improving the appearance of text, and\nimproving the degree of reader comprehension.\nThe principles outlined are then illustrated by\nmeans of worked examples in chapter 7, while\nchapters 8 and 9 consider ways of enhancing\ninstructional text by means of diagrams,\nillustrations, tables and graphs. Displaying\nnumerical data by graphical means frequently\nresults in readers being misled; this may be\nintentional or unintentional on the part of those\npresenting the information. Although this book\nprovides guidelines to improve the legibility of\ngraphs, there is, unfortunately, little discussion\nof the relationship between numerical signi-\nficance and appearance. This is an important\nomission, now that computer charting programs\nenable users to present the same set of data in a\nvariety of ways at the touch of a button.\nChapters 10 to 13 cover specific topics: the\ndesign of forms and questionnaires; text for the\nvisually impaired; text for older readers, and\nelectronic text (i.e. screen design). The chapters\nfocusing on the visually impaired and the older\nreader are particularly useful, as this material is\noften omitted from mainstream textbooks.\nChapter 14 discusses the evaluation of instruc-\ntional text in terms of content, presentation and\nteaching effectiveness. Some examples of\nchecklists for assessing the layout and technical\nquality of school text books are provided, along\nwith measures to gauge the suitability of a text\nfor its intended readers (readability indices and\ncloze tests, for example). Hartley rightly\nemphasizes the limitations of such measures, yet\nillustrates their usefulness in the decision-\nmaking process by means of case studies.\nOverall, the book presents a great deal of useful\n127\nReviews\ninformation and illustrative examples, and there\nare ample references to primary source material\nfor those requiring more in-depth knowledge.\nThe clarity of the presentation would be\nimproved if the separation of figures from their\ncorresponding reference in the text could be\navoided, and the inclusion of section numbers\nwould also be helpful. Yet despite these minor\nreservations, I would have no hesitation in\nrecommending this book as a useful resource\nfor anyone involved in the design of\ninstructional materials.\nLorraine Warren, University of Humberside\nPreparing Materials for Open and Distance\nLearning: An Action Guide for Teachers and\nTrainers by Derek Rowntree, Kogan Page,\nLondon (in association with the Institute of\nEducational Technology, Open University),\nISBN: 0-7494-1159-7, 1994.\nThe author of this guide needs no introduction.\nHe has contributed extensively to the field of\neducational technology, curriculum develop-\nment, and open and distance learning.\nThe delivery of learning has changed over the\nlast 25 years with the development of open\nlearning, flexible delivery courses, and the\nwidening of student access to courses and\ninstitutions. This change has resulted in the\nneed for materials to be available in a more\ndiverse and flexible form in order to be sym-\npathetic to different learner characteristics and\nto promote deeper learning.\nThis guide is aimed at those who are about to\ndesign and produce largely print-based\nmaterials and\/or adapt existing materials for\nparticular students. It is not, in my view, to be\nread from cover to cover, but to be used as a\nstructured guide for the preparation, production\nand adaptation of materials, and for the\nsupport of learners using such materials. There\nare many useful checklists that can be adapted\nfor existing courses whether face-to-face or at a\ndistance.\nThe guide is divided into four main sections: an\nintroduction plus sections (called stages) on\nplanning materials, preparing for writing, and\nwriting and re-writing.\nThe introductory section lists the types of\nmaterials that could be used from print-based\nmaterials to technology-based materials, and\nincludes a comprehensive section of sample\npages from existing flexible learning courses.\nStage 1 deals with planning, and contains some\nuseful suggestions and tactics for finding out\nabout intended recipients, because the belief is\nthat this information will directly dictate\npresentation and design strategies. The question\nof framing objectives is considered briefly but\nconcisely, together with how to derive content\nfrom these objectives. And advice is given on\nmaking the material more learner-centred, on\nchoosing media, and on supporting students,\nwith some useful checklists on where this\nsupport might come from.\nIn Stage 2, there are suggestions and checklists\non time management, on scheduling work, and\non determining what resources might be\navailable to enable you to develop your own\nmaterials. Sequencing of learning is considered,\ntogether with suggestions on developing\nactivities for students, and the types of feedback\nyou might use. There are also suggestions on the\nphysical layout of printed text with the aim of\nallowing students to access information and\nideas .quickly (Rowntree refers to making the\nprose 'clearer' and more 'cheering' to the\nreader). There is stress for the need to include\nmeaningful examples in the text, with a good list\nof possible sources, although it is somewhat\nsurprising that assessment is not really con-\nsidered here (or indeed in Stage 1), and is dealt\nwith in the last section on writing and re-\nwriting. Inclusion here would have emphasized\nthe need to consider assessment very early in the\ndevelopment of flexible learning materials (or\nany other learning materials for that matter).\nStage 3 contains some useful tips and advice on\nlanguage style and how to get started, how to\ncheck for readability, and for completing and\nediting for first draft. And finally on piloting:\nWrite + Try it out + Improve it.\nAlthough the section on further reading could\nhave been more comprehensive, it is sufficient\nfor the purposes of this guide, and there are\nreferences to the texts throughout at appro-\npriate points, though I did find the use of some\nabbreviations rather irritating.\n128\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nI certainly think the guide is interesting, and\nindeed could be invaluable for those considering\ndeveloping flexible learning materials.\nGareth Jones, University of Teesside\nTeach Yourself with Open Learning by Derek\nRowntree, Kogan Page, London, ISBN: 0-7494-\n1153-8, 1993\nThis is an extremely practical and usable book,\nagain by Rowntree. While generally aimed at\nreaders who are new to open learning, it has\nmuch wider applicability, offering much to\nthose already experienced or, indeed, to any\neducationist interested in preparing open-\nlearning materials.\nInterestingly, the book is itself written in the\nform of an open-learning text. Each chapter is\nfocused, with very clear, boldly titled sections\nwith specific objectives. The nine chapters cover\ntopics such as 'You and your learning', 'What\nopen learning can offer you', 'How does open\nlearning work', 'Choosing your open learning\nprogramme', 'Getting organized', 'How to\ntackle your package', 'Getting help from other\npeople', and 'Getting value for money'. The\nstyle of each chapter is interactive, with simple\nactivities where the reader is required to\nrespond to check boxes or make written\nresponses to questions. The objectives of the\nbook are clearly stated at the beginning, and the\nreader is invited to identify appropriate\nobjectives. This involves the reader immediately.\nHowever, although there is no requirement to\nstudy all the material in sequence, and dipping\ninto chapters and sections is quite possible, this\nis a book that demands a certain degree of\nreflection and commitment.\nThe style and layout are light and informative,\nand the book is easy and fun to read. For\nexample, Chapter 4 takes the reader into topics\non course evaluation, what one might hope to\ngain from an open-learning course, how such\nmaterial might be presented, the use of different\nmedia, and possible learning techniques.\nCleverly, the author does this partly by making\nexplicit the very techniques used in writing the\nbook itself, as well as including nine sample\npages from a diverse range of open-learning\ncourses.\nThe book contains a list of useful addresses and\na short bibliography, but it is in any case\nimmensely informative without being a fact-\nbook as such. It raises issues and encourages\nvaluable reflection and self-evaluation. It is also\na manual for constant support and revision as\nwell as a one-off read. Chapter 5, for example,\ndeals with specific providers of open-learning\npackages, and has an excellent section on\ntalking to providers. It is suggested that the\nbook itself with checklists and readers' notes\nmight even be taken to an interview with a\ncourse provider. Chapter 6 includes clear and\nuseful directives on time planning, and\nintroduces the concept of a learning diary to\nrecord both personal reflections and questions\nto be raised with a tutor or friends. Chapter 7\ndeals with readers' real fears about coping with\nmaterials, and offers some very useful tips on\nsubjects such as making materials on your own\nby annotation and talking about the course. It\nalso has an excellent section on learning from a\nworkbook through the stages of previewing,\nreading and reflecting.\nThis book must be regarded as an excellent\nresource to be used not only as an introduction\nto open learning, but also throughout any\ncourse for reminders and practical support. It\ncould certainly make the difference between\nsuccess and failure on an open-learning course,\nand for this reason is highly recommended.\nTerry King, University of Portsmouth\n129\n"}
