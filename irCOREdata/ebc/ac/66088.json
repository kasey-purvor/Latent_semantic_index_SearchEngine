Social landlords and the \ncontrol of \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 under the Disability \nDiscrimination Act 1995 \n \nNeil Cobb\u2022 \n \n \n(1) Introduction \n \nThe recently enacted Disability Discrimination Act 2005 will extend and \nintensify the protection from discrimination afforded to disabled people by the \nDisability Discrimination Act 1995 (\u2018the DDA\u2019).1 This may seem a welcome \ndevelopment: the original legislation, an expedient enacted reluctantly in the \nface of an increasingly vocal Disability Rights Movement, has long been \ncriticised as less than comprehensive. In recent months, however, litigation \nhas raised new concerns that as it stands the DDA, a \u2018hasty and unwieldy \npolitical compromise\u2019,2 may in certain contexts be over-inclusive, with \nunforeseen and unwelcome ramifications for other aspects of social policy. The \nparticular issue highlighted by the leading case of Manchester City Council v \nRomano and Samari,3 which this article explores, is the tension between the \nduty of social landlords not to discriminate against the mentally disordered, and \ntheir responsibility to protect the residents of social housing from so-called \n\u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019. Sections 22 to 24 of the DDA, which prohibit \ndiscrimination in housing provision, restrict the circumstances in which a \nlandlord can take action to control anti-social behaviour \u2018related\u2019 to certain \nmental disorders. In particular, exclusion from social housing on grounds of \n 2\nsuch conduct, through either refusal to allocate property, or eviction, will be \ndiscriminatory, and therefore illegal, unless it can be justified as necessary to \nprotect the health or safety of other residents.  \nThe first part of this paper positions the DDA against the backdrop of \ncontemporary housing policy, as characterised by followers of Foucault\u2019s work \non governmentality.4 It notes that whilst access to the sector is ostensibly \ngoverned by the principle of need, this welfarist objective has been subverted \nin the face of the anxieties of what Nikolas Rose describes as advanced liberal \ngovernment;5 in particular, the threat posed by certain categories of \u2018risky\u2019 \nsubject.6 In an effort to combat anti-social behaviour, occupation of social \nhousing is presented as conditional upon the exercise of responsible moral \nagency. For those who fail to align their conduct accordingly, that conditionality \nmay be enforced, with an individual excluded from the sector notwithstanding \nhis need. Two rationalities are employed to justify departure from welfarism in \nsuch circumstances. On the one hand, exclusion is viewed as necessary to \ncontrol risks that a provider is unwilling or unable to underwrite. On the other, \nthose who fail to satisfy the conditions of their occupation are characterised as \nmorally irresponsible; personally blameworthy for their failure to take \nresponsibility for their conduct, and as such undeserving of the benefit of \noccupation within the sector.  \nThe paper goes on to draw attention to the problems that arise when \nthese justifications for exclusion, grounded in rationalities of risk and \nresponsibility, are applied to the paradigm of the mentally disordered tenant. \n 3\nKey to this analysis is the premise that diagnosis of a mental disorder brings \nindividuals within what sociologists term the \u2018medical model\u2019; an interpretive \ntool used to explain a range of deviant behaviour. The medical model, I argue, \noperates according to particular governmental rationalities, in tension with \nthose evident within housing policy. First, under the medical model, health and \nwelfare professionals are engaged as sources of expert knowledge (and \npower) relating to the management of the risky subject. Their focus upon \nreduction of risk through the inclusionary techniques of treatment and support \nmay conflict, however, with the exclusionary risk strategies employed by \nhousing managers. Second, the medical model problematizes the rationality of \nthe morally irresponsible anti-social tenant. It treats the mentally disordered as \nincapable of responsible agency, and therefore blameless for their actions. \nRather than morally irresponsible the mentally disordered are constructed as \nmorally non-responsible, challenging the appropriateness of their subjection to \nthe moral obligations of conditional housing provision. As the paper explores, \nhowever, this assumption of non-responsibility is itself controversial. Both \nmoral philosophers and mental health professionals question whether medical \nclassification of a mental disorder should always absolve an individual of the \ncapacity for responsible agency. Indeed, moral discourses continue to operate \nin relation to the anti-social behaviour of the mentally disordered, with \nindividuals, in certain circumstances, expected to take responsibility for their \nbehaviour. \n 4\nThe second and final part of the paper argues that criticism levelled at the \nrestrictions on conditionality imposed by the DDA mirror the discourses of \nadvanced liberal housing policy. It notes first the explicit concern of the Court \nof Appeal in Romano with the management of risk through exclusion: that the \n\u2018health and safety\u2019 justification is inadequate to ensure protection of other \nresidents and providers from the full range of threats posed by the mentally \ndisordered, and its consequent attempt to neutralise the legislation. However, \nthe paper then explores a further, implicit, concern that the DDA incorporates \ninto law the medical model\u2019s assumption of non-responsibility. By precluding \nexclusion (in the absence of a risk to health or safety) simply on grounds of a \ncausal mental disorder, an individual is no longer obliged to exercise \nresponsible agency as a condition of his occupation, even when he might be \ndeemed capable of doing so. This outcome has two consequences. Principally, \nthe legislation limits the ability of providers to shape the conduct of anti-social \ntenants through conditionality. It has been suggested, however, that the DDA \nis a threat not only to providers, but the mentally disordered themselves, by \npatronising those it seeks to protect. Its assumption that the mentally \ndisordered as a class are intrinsically incapable of responsible agency is \narguably as an affront to their dignity, which anti-discrimination law in particular \npurports to champion.  \nThe paper concludes, however, by questioning whether the power to \nencourage responsible moral agency amongst the mentally disordered through \nconditionality is really of greater value than tackling their social exclusion \n 5\nthrough the provision of stable housing, suggesting that the DDA, in some \nmodified form, is perhaps a welcome reinforcement of welfarism within the \nsector. \n \n(2) Policy conflicts: social exclusion, housing and the mentally disordered \n \nIn May 2003 the government\u2019s Social Exclusion Unit (\u2018the SEU\u2019) engaged \nin a major consultation exercise, which sought to establish reasons for, and \nsolutions to, the particular exclusion experienced by people with mental health \nproblems. Its final report, published in June 2004, emphasises the stigma and \ndiscrimination still experienced by the mentally disordered, and the difficulties \nthey face in accessing basic services, often exacerbating their symptoms.7  \nHousing problems are highlighted as a fundamental issue in the report, \npart of \u2018getting the basics right\u2019, as \u2018decent and stable housing is critical to \nproviding a sense of security\u2019.8 The document notes particularly that the \nmentally disordered are one and a half times more likely to live in rented \naccommodation, and so stresses the need to ensure that renters are helped to \nsecure appropriate accommodation and supported in sustaining their \ntenancies. This is a problem faced particularly by social landlords. Social \nhousing has developed as a \u2018safety-net\u2019 tenure, providing residual \naccommodation for many of the most vulnerable and marginalised in society.9 \nThe mentally disordered make up around nine per cent of applicants accepted \nby local housing authorities (\u2018LHAs\u2019) in England under homelessness \n 6\nlegislation on grounds of priority need, a figure that has continued to rise since \n1997. Of these, a high proportion experience what the SEU\u2019s report describes \nas \u2018severe and enduring\u2019 mental health problems, yet they are housed in \nmainstream accommodation following the closure of long-stay psychiatric \nhospitals and the development of care in the community policies. However, \nreductions in LHA stock as a consequence of the Right to Buy and Large Scale \nVoluntary Transfers means they are increasingly housed by Registered Social \nLandlords (\u2018RSLs\u2019) and other voluntary organisations, which often operate \nspecialist supported housing for this purpose.10 \nWhilst the SEU\u2019s report is a welcome development in policy towards \nmental disorder, it is a limited analysis in at least one important way. It is \nnotable that the document makes no mention of the threat to the social \ninclusion of the mentally disordered posed by the government\u2019s anti-social \nbehaviour strategy. The government has made clear that tackling \u2018anti-social \nbehaviour\u2019 \u2013 low-level disorder affecting the quality of life of residents in their \nneighbourhoods \u2013 is one of its highest priorities.11 It has adopted a highly \npunitive approach to the problem, exemplified perhaps by the ubiquitous anti-\nsocial behaviour order (\u2018ASBO\u2019).12 However, there has been little \nacknowledgement that a substantial proportion of the perpetrators of such \nconduct have mental health problems.13 Certain conditions such as bipolar \ndisorder, schizophrenia, severe depression and personality disorders, can \nmanifest in behaviour that may appear threatening, or negatively affect the \nquality of life of neighbours.14 As the mental health charity MIND noted during \n 7\nthe SEU\u2019s consultation process, the prevalence of psychiatric conditions \namong those targeted for their so-called anti-social behaviour could well lead \nto further stigmatisation of mental disorder, intensifying the social exclusion of \nthis group.15 Attention has been drawn particularly to the controversial use of \nASBOs to control the symptoms of autism and Tourette\u2019s syndrome.16 \nThese policies have serious implications too for the access of the \nmentally disordered to social housing, upon which they are so reliant. The \ngovernment continues to present anti-social behaviour as a problem occurring \npredominantly around areas of social housing,17 and as such social landlords \nare expected to take responsibility for its control. Under section 218A of the \nHousing Act 199618 they are now required to construct policies and procedures \nfor its reduction,19 further reinforcing Cowan\u2019s earlier claim that \u2018housing and \nits management has become a crucial part of the crime control industry; \nhousing departments have become intermediators in the new criminal justice \nsystem\u2019.20 To that end, over the last decade housing providers have been \ngranted a range of statutory powers enabling them to better control access to, \nand continued occupation of, their housing on behavioural grounds. The \ntraditional nuisance grounds for eviction under the assured and secure tenancy \nregimes have been extended,21 and new low-security tenancies developed. \nThe introductory tenancy allows LHAs to evict a household easily during the \nfirst year,22 extendable by a further six months.23 Whilst the introductory \ntenancy is unavailable to housing associations, the Housing Corporation \nencourages Registered Social Landlords (\u2018RSLs\u2019) to use what are colloquially \n 8\ntermed \u2018probationary\u2019 tenancies: low-security assured shorthold tenancies \nagain imposed for the first year of occupation. The more recent demotion \nregime enables all social landlords to reduce security to that of an introductory \ntenancy at any time.24 Finally, allocation processes have been harnessed to \nachieve crime control objectives. LHAs are able to exclude housing applicants \nwith a history of anti-social behaviour from their waiting lists for housing \naccommodation, or else give them lower priority on those lists,25 whilst \nguidance on the operation of the homelessness legislation now specifically \ncites eviction as a result of anti-social behaviour as \u2018intentional homelessness\u2019, \nabsolving LHAs from their duty to rehouse the applicant.26  \nMIND has voiced particular concern about the effect of these new housing \nmanagement powers.27 Whilst within the SEU\u2019s report the government might \ntalk of supporting the mentally disordered in their tenancies, it suggests that \nthe measures may instead encourage greater use of eviction by social \nlandlords as a solution to complaints about their behaviour, exacerbating \nhomelessness amongst a group already highly susceptible to this problem.28 \nAs Brooke LJ was prepared to concede in Romano, \u2018[t]o remove someone \nfrom their home may be a traumatic thing to do in the case of many who are \nnot mentally impaired. It may be even more traumatic for the mentally \nimpaired.\u201929 It is likely too that for mentally disordered individuals reliant on \nsocial housing, exclusion from allocation lists for past behaviour may leave \nthem without adequate alternative housing options. It is this underlying tension \nbetween the promotion of stable accommodation for the mentally disordered, \n 9\nand the increasing concern of social landlords with anti-social behaviour, that \nforms the basis of this article.  \n \n(3) Justifying exclusion from social housing: risk and responsibility \n \nIt is a common assertion that contemporary social housing policy and \npractice are dictated by a discourse of need.30 This claim is supported by a \nglance at the legislative systems regulating allocation procedures, which grant \npriority status to a diminishing quantity of stock to certain categories of \nvulnerable individual. The mentally disordered are specifically protected in this \nway. Following criticism that \u2018care in the community policies\u2019 were developed \nwithout clear enough consideration of their implications for housing policy,31 \nthe Housing Act 1996 now provides that where an individual is vulnerable as a \nresult of his disorder, he should be granted specific priority under both general \nallocation schemes and the homelessness legislation.32 Housing \ncommentators recognise, however, that the welfarist objectives underpinning \nthe principle of need are increasingly threatened by the concern of advanced \nliberalism with the effective governance of \u2018risky\u2019 subjects. The progressive \nresidualisation and marginalisation of social housing has brought within it a \ndisproportionate concentration of such individuals. Its occupants are \ncharacterised consequently as a targeted population,33 requiring intensive \ngovernance by housing providers and other agencies.34 On the one hand, the \noften serious vulnerabilities suffered by many tenants, including mental \n 10\ndisorder, place them at risk, particularly from social exclusion. On the other, \nhowever, those same individuals may also pose risks to their housing \nproviders and\/or the wider community. Perhaps the most likely of these latter \nexternal risks is difficulty with the payment of rent, which may threaten the \neconomic viability of a landlord. The focus of this article, however, is the \nproblem of anti-social behaviour. The anti-social tenant is viewed within \nhousing policy as a risk not only to the quality of life of individual residents, but \nthe reputation of entire estates or neighbourhoods and the possibility that they \nwill become, or remain, \u2018difficult-to-let\u2019.35  \nGovernmentality theorists have noted the various and subtle ways in \nwhich contemporary advanced liberalism; an often incoherent combination of \nneo-liberal, communitarian and neo-conservative ideology,36 attempts to \ngovern risky subjects by shaping them as self-regulating \u2018active citizens\u2019, \ncapable of aligning themselves to constructed norms of behaviour.37 For John \nFlint, social housing provision provides an important example of these \ndevelopments. The welfare state is viewed increasingly as a moral hazard to \nthose it serves; blamed for creating a dependency culture which reduces the \nindividual responsibility of recipients. As such, occupants of social housing are \nencouraged by providers, through a range of what Foucault terms technologies \nof self, to engage as responsible tenants.38 Tenants are persuaded first to \nbehave as \u2018active consumers\u2019, capable of exercising choice in respect of the \nhousing \u2018product\u2019.39 Second, they are reconstructed as \u2018moral members of \n 11\nresponsible communities\u2019 willing and able to refrain from anti-social \nbehaviour.40  \nThe ultimate technology employed by providers to shape this latter \nresponsible moral agency is conditionality of housing provision: an individual\u2019s \nentitlement to occupation within the sector is increasingly dependent upon \nsatisfying certain conditions of behaviour.41 Whilst technologies of self such as \nconditionality may well succeed in changing behaviour, the concern of this \npaper is the anti-social tenant who fails to align his conduct as required. For \nthis individual, technologies of the self are likely to give way to increasingly \ndisciplinary forms of control. The severest of these technologies, of course, is \nexclusion from the sector altogether, as conditionality is enforced. One can see \nthen the tension within advanced liberal housing policy between the principles \nof need and conditionality. Two justifications, however, are deployed to support \nexclusion from social housing in such circumstances. \nFirst, a landlord may consider itself unable to underwrite the risk posed by \nan anti-social individual who proves resistant to technologies of self. Risky \nindividuals are increasingly difficult to accommodate within social housing, \ngiven the pressures of managerialism on the sector.42 Exclusion from social \nhousing is viewed as a way to manage that risk, by physically removing \nrecalcitrant perpetrators from a particular housing environment. Providers \nincreasingly govern access to the sector through assessments of risk as well \nas need,43 with the legal infrastructure governing access to the sector modified \naccordingly. Risk assessments are employed within allocation decision-\n 12\nmaking, enabling exclusion of individuals on application.44 Introductory \ntenancies extend the operation of these processes by providing a further \nopportunity to assess risk in situ, whilst retaining the power to evict an \noccupant easily if that risk materialises. Thereafter, exclusion is still possible \nunder the secure and assured tenancies, though considerably more difficult \nbecause the requirement of reasonableness enables a court to balance the \neffect of eviction on vulnerable households.45 Yet even here the discourse of \nrisk has taken precedence over need. Whilst the effect of nuisance behaviour \non other residents must always be taken into account,46 a statutory structure to \nthe courts\u2019 discretion incorporated by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 now \ndemands that primary consideration should be given to the effect of the \noffending conduct on others if it were to continue.47 \nSecond, exclusion is further justified by ascribing personal responsibility \nand blame to the tenant for his failure to take responsibility for his actions. Anti-\nsocial behaviour is treated within government discourse as the product of a \nmoral deficit on the part of the individual perpetrator; its cause simply a \nproblem of disrespect.48  As the government elaborates in its White Paper \nRespect and Responsibility: \n \n\u2018[t]he common element in all anti-social behaviour is that it \nrepresents a lack of respect or consideration for other people. It shows a \nselfish inability or unwillingness to recognise when one\u2019s individual \n 13\nbehaviour is offensive to others, and a refusal to take responsibility for \nit.\u201949 \n \nHaworth and Manzi suggest that this individualistic, moralistic approach to the \ncause of anti-social behaviour permeates the discourses of housing \nmanagement.50 Anti-social tenants alone are to blame for their failure to satisfy \nthe conditions of their occupation. They are capable, but unwilling, to take \nresponsibility for their conduct. As such, the excluded perpetrator no longer \ndeserves to be a social tenant, whilst exclusion allows limited housing \nresources to be re-allocated to other, more \u2018deserving\u2019, applicants.  \n A key consequence of this construction of the \u2018irresponsible\u2019 anti-social \nindividual is a refusal to absolve perpetrators from blame for their conduct on \ngrounds of their own difficult circumstances. As the government emphasises:  \n \n\u2018Family problems, poor educational attainment, unemployment, and \nalcohol and drug misuse can all contribute to anti-social behaviour. But \nnone of these problems can be used as an excuse for ruining other \npeople\u2019s lives. Fundamentally, anti-social behaviour is caused by a lack of \nrespect for other people.\u201951 \n \nOne finds then rejection by government of structural explanations of anti-social \nbehaviour as the product of socio-economic deprivation.52 Instead, there is an \nemphasis, highlighting the influence of neo-conservatism upon the \n 14\ngovernment\u2019s communitarian agenda, of the need \u2018to reintroduce the notion of \nblame, and sharply reduce our readiness to call people \u2018victims\u2019\u2019.53 Individuals \nare culpable irrespective of these mitigating factors, because ultimately they \ncan still choose to behave appropriately. Housing providers, once again, \nappear to have drawn directly from these assumptions; for Brown, \u2018the \ndiscourse [within the sector] is one of \u2018common sense\u2019 morality rather than \npathology\u2019.54  \n \n(4) Problematizing mental disorder: the medical model \n \nAdvanced liberalism, as applied through social housing policy, justifies \nexclusion of anti-social tenants on grounds of their failure as responsible moral \nagents.  Not only is it necessary in certain circumstances to manage the risk \nthey pose to others, but given that that failure is simply a problem of \nirresponsibility, those excluded are blameworthy and so undeserving of further \nwelfare provision. This section, however, problematizes these justifications \nthrough their application to the paradigm of the mentally disordered tenant. \n\u2018Mentally disordered\u2019, for the purpose of this paper, refers simply to any person \ndiagnosed with a psychiatric condition by a clinician. Through the process of \nmedical classification, an individual is drawn within what sociologists term the \n\u2018medical model\u2019;55 a tool employed to explain a range of deviant behaviour. \nRobert Veatch suggests that a particular deviancy will be classified under the \nmedical model \u2018if it is judged (a) involuntary and (b) organic, if (c) the class of \n 15\nrelevant, technically competent experts is physicians, and if (d) it falls below \nsome socially defined minimal standard of acceptability\u2019.56 These assumed \ncharacteristics of the mentally disordered have two important implications for \nthe rationalities of risk and responsibility that guide governance of anti-social \ntenants through exclusion.  \n \n(a) Medico-welfare professionals as experts \n  \n Foucault contends that knowledge is essential to the exercise of power \nthrough governance.57 Housing professionals undoubtedly have claim to sole \nexpertise in many areas of housing management. Diagnosis of a mental \ndisorder, however, establishes competing sources of knowledge\/power which \nproviders must negotiate. Under the medical model, as noted by Veatch, \nhealth professionals are identified as \u2018technically competent experts\u2019, with the \ntraining necessary to both classify and treat an individual\u2019s psychiatric \ncondition. I would argue that diagnosis also draws welfare professionals such \nas social workers within this category, given their various duties to support \nthose vulnerable as a result of their disorders.58 There is clearly potential for \nconflict between the approaches of medico-welfare and housing professionals \nto the governance of the mentally disordered. The sole concern of medico-\nwelfare professionals is the risk that a mentally disordered subject poses to \nhimself. As such, they will inevitably seek to ensure that they are maintained \nwithin the social rented sector irrespective of the risk their conduct poses to \n 16\nothers.59 The disruption associated with homelessness through lack of other \nfeasible housing options, or the instability of private renting, has been shown to \nexacerbate psychiatric conditions.60 Indeed, as Cowan argues, maintaining the \nmentally disordered within the social rented sector following \ndeinstitutionalisation was itself a form of risk management. They were \nidentified as having priority need for social housing, because without settled \naccommodation they were thought to pose a risk to themselves.61  \n Possession proceedings, as we shall see, are often the setting for \nconflicts of knowledge and expertise between housing providers and medico-\nwelfare professionals. However, where there exists the possibility of conflict \none finds too the opportunity for productive co-operation. Efforts have been \nmade by the government to encourage greater inter-agency partnership \nbetween welfare agencies. Such joined-up thinking reflects an epistemological \nmove towards the sharing of knowledge of a particular subject between \nagencies,62 enabling the incorporation of medico-welfare expertise into a \nlandlords\u2019 approach to risk management.63 This can have beneficial \nconsequences. Supporting the mentally disordered in their tenancies, rather \nthan excluding them, may well prove a superior risk management strategy for \nhousing providers expected, unlike medico-welfare professionals, to protect \nresidents of their housing from anti-social behaviour. It is generally accepted \nthat rather than controlling risk, exclusion simply transposes it elsewhere; often \ninto the private rented sector where the possibility for governance is weakened \nconsiderably.64 In some cases the same communities may face that risk again \n 17\nas the perpetrator is re-housed in the locality. Moreover, if exclusion \nexacerbates the disorder, an individual poses a greater risk not only to himself, \nbut to others as well. This suggests the need for a move away from punitive \nresponses to anti-social behaviour towards holistic, preventative solutions. \nThere is an emphasis particularly upon early intervention to prevent tenancy \nbreakdown. Negotiation between agencies can lead to the cessation of legal \nproceedings, as other non-legal solutions are identified.65 \n For many housing providers, partnership working of this kind is already \nintrinsic to their operations. Specialist supported housing organisations in \nparticular draw together the provision of housing with treatment and support \nservices. 66 General housing providers too are increasingly establishing \nprotocols to ensure that resort to legal sanctions is preceded by an \nassessment of the mental health of the individual, the bearing this may have \non his behaviour and the possibility of support or treatment of a diagnosed \ncondition.67 These holistic approaches can only improve under the \ngovernment\u2019s Supporting People programme. However, inter-agency \ncooperation is not always what it should be.68 Housing managers, most likely \ngeneral providers, who fail to engage with other agencies may have no \nknowledge of a tenant\u2019s condition until a late stage in legal proceedings. Of \ncourse, housing providers are not always the problem. Evidence suggests that \nsocial services often fail to respond to the requests for assistance from \nlandlords, with possession proceedings sometimes initiated in an effort to \nattract the attention of uncooperative agencies.69 \n 18\n (b) The mentally disordered as non-responsible agents \n \n Exclusion of the anti-social from social housing is justified by the \nassumption that an individual is solely responsible for his failure to satisfy the \nconditions of his occupation, and as such is appropriately blamed for his failure \nto satisfy the conditions of his occupation. Structural explanations of conduct \nare abandoned in favour of those emphasising individual moral deficit. \nCommentators continue to argue, however, that these structural problems \nshould indeed mitigate responsibility for bad behaviour. It is unfair to place fault \nsolely upon the shoulders of the individual, when externalities for which they \nare not responsible impinge upon their capacity to behave appropriately. This \nappears to be the implication behind Pauline Papps\u2019 suggestion that it is \ninappropriate for the government to disregard \u2018wider issues and problems \nfaced by the perpetrators, which are often beyond their control\u2019.70 Criticism of \nthis kind resonates particularly with the attitudes of many towards mental \ndisorder. Psychiatric conditions are even more difficult to disassociate from \nanti-social behaviour than socio-economic circumstance because of the impact \nthey are presumed to have upon an individual\u2019s capacity for control his actions. \nThe paradigm of the mentally disordered tenant illustrates the danger of \nmislabelling inherent in a concept as nebulous as anti-social behaviour. The \ngovernment\u2019s explanation of all such conduct as a matter of disrespect is \nobviously inadequate when applied to the mentally disordered, highlighting the \n 19\nway in which such political sloganeering has the potential, as MIND argues, to \nstigmatise the mentally disordered through their elision with the archetype of \nthe anti-social \u2018yob\u2019.71 \n The medical model takes a particular approach to the responsibility of the \nmentally disordered. As Veatch suggests, it assumes that the actions of those \ndiagnosed with a psychiatric condition are entirely non-voluntary. It treats all \nanti-social conduct of the mentally disordered as the symptom of illness - the \nproduct of a chemical or biological imbalance in the brain - and, as such, a \nproblem of pathology rather than morality. Blame and stigma are inappropriate \nreactions to such behaviour because the underlying condition is both imposed \nupon the individual and entirely out of his control. The medical model promotes \nthen absolute exculpation of an individual of responsibility for his actions: \n \n\u2018A sinner or criminal or morally irresponsible person would be seen \nas deficient in character to the extent that he has brought on his condition; \nthe person in the sick role is not. More significantly, one in the sick role is \nnot expected to use willpower or self-control to overcome his condition\u2019.72 \n \nThe mentally disordered are incapable of exercising, rather than unwilling to \nexercise, responsible moral agency. Rather than morally irresponsible, they \nare characterised as non-responsible. This assumption of non-responsibility \nposes serious problems for the operation of conditionality in social housing \nprovision. As we have seen, exclusion from social housing is justified by \n 20\nconstructing the anti-social tenant as personally blameworthy for his failure to \ntake responsibility for his actions. Under the medical model, however, the \nmentally disordered individual is blameless, and as such should not be \nsubjected to the demands of conditionality. \n The assumption of non-responsibility, however, is itself highly \nproblematic. Few believe that the anti-social symptoms of those classified as \nmentally disordered are always, as Papps puts it, beyond an individual\u2019s \ncontrol, and that it is always unreasonable to expect them to take responsibility \nfor their behaviour. The extent to which actions caused by a mental disorder \nshould be treated as non-voluntary continues to tax theorists of action, 73 going \nto the heart of the unresolved debate between proponents of free will and \ndeterminism.74 The thesis of non-responsibility under the medical model is an \nexample of hard determinism. However, Western philosophy, which tends to \npresume capacity for free will, demands much more than psychiatric \nclassification to excuse an individual from responsibility for his actions. The \nmoral philosopher Joel Feinberg, for instance, recognises the medical model\u2019s \ntendency to reject ascription of blame. A psychiatrist \u2018might hold it self-evident \nthat sick people are not to be treated as responsible people; hence the criteria \nof illness are themselves criteria of non-responsibility\u2019.75 He concludes, \nhowever, that this is undoubtedly a mistaken assumption: two additional \ncriteria are required. It is necessary first to establish that the mental disorder is \na \u201cbut for\u201d cause of particular offending conduct. Second, in line with the \nAristotelian approach to responsibility assumed in the West, philosophers of \n 21\naction argue that to be entirely non-responsible a particular mental disorder \nmust render an individual either incapable of controlling his behaviour, or else \nunable to rationalise what he is doing.76  \n For Feinberg, \u2018not all neurotic and psychotic disorders, by any means, \nproduce compulsive or delusionary symptoms\u2019.77 Indeed, challenges to the \nmedical model\u2019s assumption of non-responsibility have also been made from a \npsychiatric perspective. Pamela Bjorklund, for instance, claims that in practice \nvery few of those diagnosed with a psychiatric condition are ever entirely non-\nresponsible, continuing that \u2018[i]n fact, their agency and responsibility admit \ndegrees; and in any given instance of moral adjudication, the degrees, limits \nand boundaries of their (moral) responsibility are continuously negotiated and \nrenegotiated\u2019.78 This is a particularly interesting comment. It emphasises that, \nwhere a mental disorder does not fully exculpate, the moral expectations \ndemanded of the mentally disordered are not absolute. Instead, the process of \nmoral adjudication is constantly contested, with the outcome dependent upon \nthe adjudicator, the particular subject, and all the circumstances within which \nthe judgement is made. It is contended that two sources of knowledge tend to \nbe drawn upon to assess the moral responsibility of an individual for his anti-\nsocial conduct. On the one hand, an adjudicator will consider the degree to \nwhich he believes an individual is capable of exercising direct control over \nparticular behaviour. On the other, he will often assess the individual according \nto his \u2018meta-responsibility\u2019. Edward Mitchell employs this term to explain the \nascription of blame not for anti-social conduct itself, but for steps taken by the \n 22\nindividual to bring about or exacerbate the condition that causes that \nconduct.79 For example, an individual may engage in substance abuse, termed \n\u2018dual diagnosis\u2019, which may increase the anti-social symptoms of a psychiatric \ncondition. He may also fail to engage with support or treatment programs \noffered to him.  \nOf course, it is impossible to identify with any precision the extent to \nwhich a particular individual\u2019s conduct is caused by the disorder, or the extent \nto which he should be expected to control his anti-social conduct or contribute \nto the management of his condition to prevent it occurring. Neither neurologists \nnor psychiatrists have a \u2018magic lantern to light up the concealed corners of a \ndefendant\u2019s mind\u2019,80 dependent instead upon assessment of external \nmanifestations of the condition. In terms of compulsion, for instance, Glanville \nWilliams highlights the epistemological difficulty that:  \n \n\u2018the step between \u201che did not resist his impulse\u201d and \u201che could not \nresist his impulse\u201d is incapable of scientific proof. A fortiori there is no \nscientific measurement of the degree of difficulty which an abnormal \nperson finds in controlling his impulses\u2019.81   \n \nIt is for this reason that moral adjudication of the mentally disordered is \nconstantly contested. One thing, however, is clear: any such adjudication \ncannot be based upon the expertise of a housing provider alone. The simplistic \nmoralism of housing management discourse is wholly inadequate. Only \n 23\nthrough negotiation with medico-welfare professionals, who are inevitably \nbetter placed to assess an individual\u2019s capacity for moral responsibility in light \nof their disorder, can a provider hope to engage in a meaningful assessment of \nmoral blame. The exchange of knowledge through partnership is a necessary \nbasis for meaningful governance of the mentally disordered subject through \nconditionality.  \nAs an illustration of the conflict between medical and moral models of \nresponsibility, I want to look finally at the controversial status of the personality \ndisorder. Anti-social behaviour may well be classified by clinicians as the \nproduct of a personality disorder. Note, for example, the symptoms of dissocial \npersonality disorder, defined by the International Statistical Classification of \nDiseases and Related Health Problems (\u2018the ICD\u2019) as follows: \n \n\u2018Personality disorder characterized by disregard for social \nobligations, and callous unconcern for the feelings of others. There is \ngross disparity between behaviour and the prevailing social norms. \nBehaviour is not readily modifiable by adverse experience, including \npunishment. There is a low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for \ndischarge of aggression, including violence; there is a tendency to blame \nothers, or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behaviour bringing the \npatient into conflict with society.\u201982 \n \n 24\nHowever, whilst personality disorders are formally recognised as psychiatric \nconditions by the ICD, considerable debate remains, even amongst members \nof the medical community, as to whether they actually constitute medical \nconditions at all. Famously, Thomas Szasz has questioned the very existence \nof mental illness. He argues that it represents a social construct rather than a \ndisease, employed by doctors to explain any deviance from behavioural norms \nin medical terms.83 Whilst in light of recent scientific developments many would \ndispute Szasz\u2019s analysis in relation to more established psychiatric conditions \nsuch as schizophrenia, it appears to hold continued relevance with respect to \npersonality disorder. Commentators have argued that the psychiatric status of \npersonality disorders is a form of professional imperialism over what are in fact \nsimply extreme character traits,84 and continue to debate whether they are in \nfact susceptible to medical treatment.85 \n The problem is compounded by the fact that diagnosis of a personality \ndisorder is a highly inexact science, justified simply on identification of \nbehavioural symptoms by a psychiatrist. Indeed, a number of high profile \nmedical professionals, concerned by the government\u2019s proposals to enable the \nforcible detention of those diagnosed with severe personality disorders, have \nsuggested recently in the British Medical Journal that \u2018levels of agreement \nbetween clinicians about who should be classified in this way are often no \nbetter than chance\u2019.86 Characteristics that might constitute a personality \ndisorder under a psychiatric assessment are capable of classification under a \nmoral model as merely a problem of self-discipline. There exists then a blurred \n 25\nline between psychiatric condition and moral deficit, with classification, and the \nconsequences of that classification, dictated unpredictably by the model, \nmedical or moral, applied in a particular context. \n One common concern arising from this debate is that classification of \npersonality disorders impinges upon the responsibility of such individuals for \ntheir conduct. Bjorklund argues that unlike other mentally disordered \nindividuals, those with personality disorders suffer from absolutely no \nimpairment of either their volition or cognition,87 and as such are fully \nresponsible for their behaviour. It is questionable then whether classification of \na personality disorder should act as a mitigating, let alone exculpatory, \ncharacteristic. Suspicion of categorising personality disorders as medical \nconditions rather than moral characteristics, with the implications this has for \nthe ascription of blame, is evident in the words of one medical commentator: \n \n\u2018[b]oth the psychodynamic and biological accounts of personality \ndisorder, if indiscriminately applied, appear to diminish personal \nresponsibility. If personality disorder justifies mitigation in the forensic \nsetting, then large numbers of people in society are walking about with a \ntrump card, to be played should they ever go to court\u2019.88 \n \n(c) The medical model in the legal arena \n \n 26\nWe will return to the capacity of the mentally disordered for responsible \nmoral agency later when evaluating the criticisms levelled at the operation of \nthe DDA. For now, however, it is perhaps useful to illuminate the previous \ndiscussion through an examination of the approach to mental disorder with \nlegal proceedings. In Croydon Borough Council v Moody,89 the defendant was \na local authority tenant of 61 years of age, whose erratic and alarming \nbehaviour had led to the bringing of possession proceedings by his landlord. \nThe trial judge heard evidence from a professional psychiatrist that the \ndefendant suffered from a combination of an obsessive personality disorder \nand dementia. The evidence also suggested that the conduct could be \nsuccessfully treated, and as such it was argued that eviction would be \nunreasonable. The trial judge, however, refused to acknowledge that the \ndefendant had a mental health problem at all, and held that a possession order \nshould be granted. The judge added: \n \n\u2018Whether the behaviour is deliberate - I have no reason to doubt that \nit is deliberate - and the intention behind the behaviour - the intention in \nmy judgment is to get his own way in respect of anything which concerns \nhim and the opinions and feelings of other people are irrelevant \u2026 The \nmedical evidence does not persuade me any way that the defendant does \nnot know precisely how his actions affect other people. He may well have \na personality disorder and it may well be treatable. Applying a certain \ndegree of robustness it might well be said that a little of self-discipline, \n 27\ncoupled with a good deal of consideration for other people\u2019s feelings, \nwould be appropriate. But I strongly feel that that is an impossible \noutcome to this case.\u201990 \n \nThe decision was ultimately overturned by the Court of Appeal, which was \nnoticeably surprised by the judge\u2019s interpretation of the medical evidence. It \nconcluded that the medical evidence was in fact entirely acceptable, and as \nsuch the possibility of treatment for the disorder was a relevant consideration \nthat should have been taken into account.  \n A number of points can be drawn from this decision. It illustrates, first, the \nconflicts of knowledge and power that can arise between the competing \napproaches of medico-welfare professionals and housing providers to the \nmanagement of the risky subject. On the one hand, the plaintiff landlord wishes \nto exclude to manage the risk. On the other, the health professional advocates \ntreatment and warns of the consequences of eviction on the condition. The \ncourt emerges here as the final arbiter between these concerns. Second, the \nrefusal of the trial judge to acknowledge the expert evidence reflects clearly a \nsuspicion of psychiatric classification of personality disorder. Third, the judge \nassumed \u2013 in line with the moral rather than medical model of responsibility - \nthat even if the defendant was suffering from such a disorder, it was not \nnecessarily the case that he was unable to exercise responsible moral agency. \nIndeed, under the judge\u2019s moral adjudication the defendant alone was to blame \nfor his conduct. Notably, when engaging in his own moral adjudication of the \n 28\ndefendant\u2019s behaviour the judge talks explicitly in the terms of the philosophy \nof action; emphasising the presence to his mind of both cognition (knowing \nhow his actions affect others) and volition (the capacity to exercise self-\ndiscipline). His failure of responsible moral agency was therefore culpable, and \nas such the enforcement of conditionality through exclusion was justified.  \n \n(5) The impact of the DDA on the control of anti-social behaviour through \nhousing management: the ramifications of Romano \n \nIt is against the problematic construction of the risky and irresponsible \ntenant that I want to assess the impact of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 \non the control of anti-social behaviour by social landlords. The DDA was \ndesigned to tackle discrimination against disabled people by imposing duties \non individuals and organisations in three key areas: employment, education \nand access to goods and services. The latter category extends to housing. \nSections 22 to 24 prohibit three broad forms of housing-related discrimination. \nFirst, a person with the power to dispose of premises is prohibited from \ndiscriminating against a disabled person in the terms on which he offers to \ndispose of those premises; by refusing to dispose of those premises; or in the \nway he allocates those premises.91 Second, it is also unlawful for a person \nmanaging any premises to discriminate against a disabled person occupying \nthose premises (whether a tenant or a member of the tenant\u2019s household) in \nthe way he permits him to make use of any benefits or facilities, by refusing or \n 29\ndeliberately omitting to permit him to make use of any benefits or facilities \ncomprised in a lease; or by evicting him, or subjecting him to any other \ndetriment.92 Finally, a person whose licence or consent is required for the \ndisposal of premises must not discriminate against a disabled person by \nwithholding that licence or consent.93 \nNotably, the DDA protects only those individuals whose \u2018mental \nimpairment\u2019 has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to \ncarry out normal day-to-day activities.94 It focuses specifically then upon \nconditions that place them at particular risk of social exclusion, representing an \nimportant first step in the promotion of the SEU\u2019s objectives. Sections 22 to 24, \nin particular, mirror the emphasis placed by the SEU upon access of the \nmentally disordered to housing. Problematically, however, the definition of \nmental impairment includes the types of mental disorder, discussed above, \nwhich can give rise to the kind of challenging behaviour that might form the \nbasis of complaints to housing managers by other residents. It was not until \nMarch 2003, eight years after the passing of the legislation, that the impact of \nthe DDA on the capacity of a social landlord to control such behaviour became \napparent. Both the initial High Court decision in North Devon Homes v \nBrazier95 and the subsequent Court of Appeal judgment of Lord Justice Brooke \nin Manchester City Council v Romano96 focused upon the effect of the DDA on \nthe power of a social landlord to evict a mentally disordered occupier from a \nsecure or assured tenancy on grounds of their nuisance behaviour. The \nlitigation came as a considerable shock to social landlords, who had apparently \n 30\nfailed to appreciate the impact of the DDA upon housing management before \nthis point. As Brooke LJ explained in the Romano case, the Court of Appeal \nwere \u2018told by very experienced leading counsel that it was the publicity given to \n[the Brazier] judgment in March 2003 which attracted general attention for the \nfirst time to the possible need for a court to take the 1995 Act into account \nwhen assessing the reasonableness of making a possession order\u2019. 97 \nThe decisions confirm the following. Under the Housing Acts 1985 and \n1988, governing the right to possession of a secure and assured tenancy \nrespectively, a court must satisfy itself that it is reasonable to evict an occupier \nfor anti-social behaviour. However, if it is found that the eviction is \ndiscriminatory under the DDA, and is unjustified, it will be inherently \nunreasonable for a county court to grant a possession order. A landlord \ndiscriminates against a disabled person under the DDA if \u2018for a reason which \nrelates to the disabled person\u2019s disability, he treats him less favourably than he \ntreats or would treat others to whom that reason does or would not apply\u2019.98 \nThe seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in Clark v Novacold99 ensures an \nextremely broad interpretation of this definition. First, the reason for particular \ntreatment need not be motivated by simple hostility towards a disability per se, \nbut by any characteristic with a causal connection to that disability. It extends, \nas such, to the control of anti-social behaviour arising from a mental \nimpairment, even if a landlord is unaware of the underlying condition. Second, \nthe theoretical comparator test employed to identify whether the treatment is \nless favourable is unlike the tests under the race and sex discrimination \n 31\nlegislation. These demand that the effect of treatment on a person with a \nparticular status should be compared with that of a person without that status \nin otherwise broadly similar circumstances. The comparator under the DDA, on \nthe other hand, is someone, whether disabled or not, without the related \ncharacteristic giving rise to the treatment. As such, the perpetrator of anti-\nsocial behaviour should be compared with an individual who does not act in \nthat way, rather than a non-disabled individual who behaves in that manner. It \nis irrelevant that a landlord would have reacted in the same way to anti-social \nbehaviour that was not the result of a mental impairment. \nThe upshot of this approach then is that any prohibited act by a social \nlandlord in response to conduct related to a relevant mental impairment (in this \ncase, the bringing of possession proceedings), whether or not it is aware of \nthat impairment, will always amount to prima facie discrimination. However, the \nDDA does not preclude the landlord from regaining possession of a property in \nsuch circumstances. The statute sets out instead a \u2018fixed list\u2019 of justifications \nthat can legitimise discriminatory treatment. The only relevant justification in \nthe context of anti-social behaviour is that the occupier poses a danger to \nothers.100 The justification has two parts. The landlord must be of the opinion \nwhen it decides to regain possession of the property that eviction is necessary \nto prevent the endangerment of another\u2019s health or safety. The court must then \nsatisfy itself that it was reasonable, given all the circumstances of the case, for \nthe landlord to hold that opinion. As the Court of Appeal noted, given the \nbreadth of the definition of less favourable treatment, satisfying this justification \n 32\nis absolutely key to a social landlord wishing to avoid discriminating against a \ntenant.101 The DDA has consequences not only for the eviction of secure and \nassured tenants, but all attempts to exclude an individual from social housing. \nIt will be discriminatory for a social landlord to evict from an introductory, \n\u2018probationary\u2019 or demoted tenancy in response to behaviour caused by a \nmental impairment. The DDA also explicitly prohibits discriminatory allocation \nprocedures. An outright refusal by a social landlord to allocate premises will be \nprima facie unlawful, whether under general waiting lists or, in the case of \nLHAs, under homelessness allocations. So too will the decision to place an \nindividual at a lower point on their lists.  \nAlthough this paper focuses upon the impact of the DDA upon exclusion \nfrom social housing, it should be noted that the legislation also extends to other \ntechnologies for the governance of perpetrators. A social landlord may be \nprecluded from reducing the security of recalcitrant occupiers. Section 22(3)(c) \nstates, in full, that \u2018[i]t is unlawful for a person managing any premises to \ndiscriminate against a disabled person occupying those premises by evicting \nthe disabled person, or subjecting him to any other detriment.\u2019 \u2018Detriment\u2019 is an \nexpansive term, extending to treatment of such a kind that the individual \naffected \u2018would or might take the view that in all the circumstances it was to his \ndetriment\u2019.102 Whilst introductory or probationary tenancies apply to all new \ntenants and are therefore inherently indiscriminate, the extension of the \ntenancy by a further six months, with the further loss of security this entails, \nwould clearly be viewed by an LHA occupier as detrimental. This should also \n 33\nbe the case with demotion. Housing managers also have recourse to powers \nancillary to their management of housing: the statutory housing injunctions103 \nand the ASBO.104 As the Court of Appeal suggests, unless justified it may well \nbe illegal under the DDA for a landlord to seek sanction for breach of either \ntool.105  \n \n (6) The call for reform \n \nThe DDA has been criticised from its inception for failing to effectively \nprotect the disabled. Commentators argue in particular that it is under-inclusive \nin its definition of disability106 and that the justificatory provisions legitimate too \nmany discriminatory practices.107 As the product of political expedient, it is said \nto represent \u2018at best, half measures and reluctant reform\u2019;108 a critique that \nextends to the provisions on access to premises, with the accusation that \nsections 22 to 24 are \u2018both too narrow and too weak\u2019.109 However, following \nRomano the DDA has, for the first time, become the subject of criticism for \nappearing to impinge disproportionately in practice upon the interests of the \nnon-disabled. Brooke LJ expressed concern that as \u2018policy-driven modern \nlegislation which has not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny\u2019,110 it could lead \nto \u2018absurd and unfair consequences\u2019 for those subject to its provisions, \nconcluding that \u2018Parliament ought to review [the] legislation at an early date\u2019.111 \nSections 22 to 24, notably, were added to an already hasty bill almost as an \nafterthought at a late stage in its progress through Parliament.112 It is likely \n 34\nthen that the problems they might pose for the control of behaviour caused by \nmental disorder were left unconsidered. The Court of Appeal was therefore \nright to suggest that the government would be well-advised to examine closely \nthe ramifications of the legislation for the range of providers it affects. \nAn exhaustive discussion of the possible negative ramifications of the \nDDA, or even those provisions relating specifically to premises, is beyond the \nscope of this article.113 It can be noted briefly, however, that social landlords \nface a variety of problems beyond the control of anti-social behaviour, leading \none commentator to conclude that the DDA now \u2018presents a major \nencroachment on management of housing stock\u2019.114 The Court of Appeal, for \ninstance, raised the possibility that a landlord will be precluded by the \nlegislation from evicting an individual for rent arrears if his inability to pay is \nrelated to a mental impairment, in the absence of any economic justification for \nless favourable treatment.115 Barr and Glover-Thomas also suggest that the \nDDA undermines the effective management of short- to medium-term \nsupported housing for the mentally vulnerable,116 by preventing the operational \nflexibility required to run such projects. One of their concerns is the effective \ncontrol of anti-social behaviour within these institutions. They are equally \nworried, however, that a housing manager will be unable to evict an occupier \nas part of his support or treatment, either in order to rehouse him in more \nsuitable accommodation, or because he is no longer in need of the services, \n\u2018even though it would be intended (and may be necessary) to further both the \n 35\nobjects of the charity and the objective best interests of the housed \nindividual\u2019.117  \nReturning to the specific impact of the DDA on the control of anti-social \nbehaviour, however, it is contended that, superficially at least, the legislation \nmay actually improve upon social landlords\u2019 current governance of the anti-\nsocial by encouraging greater co-operation between housing and medico-\nwelfare professionals. First, as we have seen, even if a housing provider is \nunaware that a perpetrator of anti-social behaviour has a mental \nimpairment,118 or that his behaviour is caused by that impairment, it may still \ndiscriminate against him under the DDA by taking steps to control his conduct. \nTo ensure compliance with the legislation a social landlord would be well-\nadvised to identify whether or not the perpetrator has a causal mental \nimpairment when deciding how to respond to a particular case of anti-social \nbehaviour. This may encourage providers otherwise reluctant to engage with \nthe knowledge and expertise of medico-welfare professionals, and perhaps \nincrease preventative use of support and treatment rather than exclusion. As \nthe Court of Appeal conceded: \n \n\u2018This judgment shows that landlords whose tenants hold secure or \nassured tenancies must consider the position carefully before they decide \nto serve a notice seeking possession or to embark on possession \nproceedings against a tenant who is or might be mentally impaired. This \nis likely to compel a local housing authority to liaise more closely with the \n 36\nlocal social services authority at an earlier stage of their consideration of a \nproblem that might lead to an eviction than appears to be the case with \nmany authorities, to judge from some of the papers the DRC [Disability \nRights Commission] placed before the court.\u2019119 \n \nThe DDA may also encourage the exclusion of the mentally disordered \nfrom social housing is legitimated only as a very last resort. Under the \nlegislation a housing manager must hold a reasonable opinion that the \ntreatment is \u2018necessary\u2019 to prevent an established risk to health or safety. It is \ncontended that this could provide an opportunity for a defendant to argue that \na landlord has failed to take adequate steps to assess the benefits of \nalternative measures that might be employed to manage the risk an individual \nposes. As Brooke LJ states in Romano, a social landlord \u2018must prove that if it \ndid not take this action someone\u2019s health or safety would be endangered\u2019.120 \nThe role of alternative remedies is particularly important when a social landlord \ndecides to bring possession proceedings. Under the reasonableness \nrequirement for possession of an assured or secure tenancy, the suitability of \nalternatives to eviction is currently an irrelevant consideration,121 yet landlords \nhave available to them a range of other housing management tools; in \nparticular injunctions and ASBOs, that do not threaten a mentally disordered \noccupant with homelessness. It may well be the case that support or treatment \nof the condition is a more appropriate solution to the problem. It should be \nremembered, of course, that the \u2018health or safety\u2019 justification requires only that \n 37\na landlord has a reasonable opinion that less favourable treatment is \nnecessary. A court must therefore simply gauge whether the decision falls \nwithin the range of reasonable opinions that the landlord could have reached. \nThis standard makes it far less likely that a court will challenge the choice of \nresponse than if it were empowered to reach its own conclusion on the matter. \nHowever, the requirement may still have an important procedural role to play. It \nhas been held that an opinion is reasonable only if formed following \u2018sufficient \ninquiry\u2019 into the circumstances of the case.122 As such, a landlord should be \nexpected at the very least to provide documentary evidence that it has \nconsidered alternative responses to the complaints levelled at an occupier. \nIrrespective of the potential procedural benefits of DDA, however, the \nRomano decision has been greeted predominantly with consternation because \nof the substantive restrictions it imposes upon the governance of anti-social \nbehaviour by social landlords. The following sections explore these criticisms, \ncontending that they reflect the conflict that exists between the ostensibly \nwelfarist objectives of social housing provision and the competing advanced \nliberal discourses of risk and responsibility. \n \n(a) Conflicting systems of risk \n \nUnlike other characteristics such as race or sex warranting protection \nunder anti-discrimination legislation, the framers of the DDA recognised that \nthe disabled, given their physical or mental weaknesses, may in certain \n 38\ncircumstances represent a risk to others. This was the reason for the existence \nof the \u2018health or safety\u2019 justification. Problematically, however, the concepts of \n\u2018health\u2019 and \u2018safety\u2019 employed by the legislation limit social landlords to the \nmanagement of a particular spectrum of risk. Drawn as it is from the lexicon of \nthe workplace,123 it is terminology normally associated with accidents arising \nfrom the hazards of the industrial environment; with unexpected physical \nillness and injury. This was indeed the immediate conclusion of David Steele J \nin the Brazier case, the precursor to Romano, who assumed that eviction \nwould be unlawful under the DDA because the behaviour of the defendant did \nnot constitute \u2018an actual physical risk\u2019 to other residents.124 Anti-social \nbehaviour policies, on the other hand, are concerned with a far broader array \nof risks which do not necessarily impact directly upon an individual\u2019s physical \nintegrity, ranging from untidy gardens to noise pollution. This reflects to an \nextent the government\u2019s acceptance of Wilson and Kelling\u2019s influential \u2018broken \nwindows\u2019 thesis, which argues that low-level disorder, if left uncontrolled, can \nlead to the degeneration of communities.125  \nProtection from these low-level risks is also increasingly recognised as a \nhuman right.  Residents of social housing affected by anti-social behaviour, \nwhether caused by a mental disorder or not, are likely to have had their Article \n8 rights infringed.126 Strasbourg jurisprudence attests that a person\u2019s private \nlife extends to both physical and psychological integrity.127 Even low-level \ndisorder such as noise might fall within the ambit of Article 8 if it were to \u2018affect \nindividuals\u2019 well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a \n 39\nway as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, \nseriously endangering their health\u2019.128 Local housing authorities, as public \nauthorities, have a particular duty to actively protect and promote the Article 8 \nrights of citizens, including prevention of interference by others with the quality \nof their home life.129 Moreover, legislators are expected to ensure that statutes \nsuch as the DDA do not impact disproportionately upon those rights.130 \nHowever, because less favourable treatment can only be justified when the \nhealth or safety of a person is endangered, the DDA precludes a landlord from \ntaking action where no such threat exists. \nIt is perhaps unsurprising, given the political salience of anti-social \nbehaviour, that the Court of Appeal\u2019s response to this conflict of legislative risk \nsystems was a bout of judicial activism that has effectively neutralised sections \n22 to 24. Ignoring David Steele J\u2019s purposive interpretation of the justification \nin Brazier, Lord Justice Brooke decided to draw instead upon the definition of \nthe World Health Organisation, that health constitutes \u2018a state of complete \nphysical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease \nor infirmity\u2019.131 It is contended that the inclusion of social, as well as physical \nand mental well-being, within the definition of health has broadened the \nconcept to include all forms of anti-social behaviour that might form the subject \nof legal action. Any conduct that negatively affects his own subjective \nassessment of his quality of life in and around his home will endanger an \nindividual\u2019s well-being, whether or not it has any lasting effect on his bodily or \npsychological integrity. Even after adopting the WHO definition, Brooke LJ was \n 40\nstill convinced that the justification would not extend to all the risks a landlord \nmight expect to manage under the rubric of anti-social behaviour, suggesting \nthat behaviour that did not threaten health or safety, but caused house prices \nto decrease, could not be dealt with, even by an injunction.132 However, his \nLordship\u2019s concern seems unfounded, given that it must doubtless be the case \nthat social well-being will always be threatened by a decrease in the general \namenity of a neighbourhood serious enough to affect the housing market. \nInterestingly, application of the WHO definition of health has been \nemployed as an interpretative technique before. When the British government \nattempted to attack the legality of the EC Working Time Directive on grounds \nthat it did not fit within the head of \u2018health or safety\u2019 legislation, the European \nCourt used it to expand the power of the EC to extend its control over areas of \nsocial policy.133 However, it may not be so simple to neutralise another piece \nof welfarist legislation that has created similar conflicts with the broader risk \nmanagement associated with anti-social behaviour. The Children Act 1989 \nimposes a duty on a local authority to safeguard and promote the welfare of a \nchild in its care, unless it is \u2018necessary, for the purpose of protecting members \nof the public from serious injury\u2019.134 In a recent High Court decision, it has been \nsuggested that a council may well be precluded from imposing an ASBO when \nthe risk to others falls below this level.135 The risk system focuses solely upon \nphysical integrity, and it is unlikely that the higher courts will be able to find a \nway to bring the legislation into line with the lower risk threshold demanded by \nanti-social behaviour policies.  \n 41\n (b) Patronising the mentally disordered?  \n  \nThe Court of Appeal acted then to ensure that housing providers are able \nto protect residents and their communities from the full spectrum of risks \nassociated with anti-social behaviour. This, however, is not the only criticism \nlevelled at the DDA. A rather different, and far more interesting, concern is to \nbe found in the reaction of Andrew Arden QC, counsel for Manchester City \nCouncil in the Romano decision, in a subsequent editorial on the case. Clearly \nassuming that the WHO definition of health still precluded landlords from taking \naction in certain circumstances to protect residents from low-level anti-social \nbehaviour, he described the DDA as granting the mentally disordered:  \n \n\u2018[a] somewhat peculiar (and, perhaps, patronising) entitlement to \nmake others\u2019 lives uncomfortable if not downright miserable \u2026 [which] \nprovokes the very sort of hostility the Act is intended to avoid, and denies \nthe disabled the very acceptance that the Act is intended to secure\u2019.136  \n \nIt is contended that this passing comment reflects the broader debates which, \nas we have seen, surround adjudication of the capacity of the mentally \ndisordered for responsible moral agency.  \nUnder a moral model an individual is not absolved from responsibility for \nhis behaviour simply because he has been diagnosed with a mental disorder. \n 42\nFor him to be exculpated it is necessary to show instead both a causal link \nbetween the disorder and particular anti-social conduct, and the breakdown of \nan individual\u2019s power of cognition or volition. Where causal conduct is neither \nthe product of compulsion nor delusion, which appears to be mostly the case, \na particular moral adjudicator may construct the presence, or otherwise, of \nmoral responsibility for his actions. The DDA, however, rejects this moral \nmodel. It provides that where no risk to health or safety exists, any conduct \n\u2018related\u2019 to a relevant mental impairment cannot form the basis of less \nfavourable treatment by a housing provider. The upshot is that a landlord in \nsuch circumstances will be precluded from excluding an individual, even when \nhe might be judged on a particular moral adjudication as responsible for the \nbehaviour that forms the complaint against him. The extent to which he might \nbe capable of controlling his disorder, and\/or his \u2018meta-responsibility\u2019 for \ncreating or exacerbating that condition, will be irrelevant.137  \nReturning once again to the particular example of the personality \ndisorder, we can see clearly the consequences of the DDA for moral \nadjudication. Personality disorder is recognised by the legislation as a mental \nimpairment. The ISD constitutes an appropriate source for this purpose,138 \nwhich explicitly recognises the condition. Diagnosis of a personality disorder \nwill result in this assumption of non-responsibility under the DDA, even though \nconduct is arguably an anti-social character trait, for which an individual should \nalways be held responsible. Moreover, the application of the DDA rests upon \nwhat we have seen is an extremely unpredictable psychiatric classification. \n 43\nCurrently, \u2018the existence or not of a mental impairment is very much a matter \nfor qualified and informed medical opinion\u2019.139 As such, the protection afforded \nto individuals under the legislation is likely to be uneven and subject to \ninevitable controversy. Indeed, the problem may increase under the Disability \nDiscrimination Act 2005, which will soon remove the requirement that a \ndisorder must be \u2018clinically well-recognised\u2019.140 Identification of a mental \nimpairment will then no longer need to be substantiated by a respected body of \nmedical professionals, increasing the possibility of a court accepting \ncontroversial diagnoses. \nWhat the DDA has effectively achieved is the imposition into law of the \nmedical model\u2019s assumption of non-responsibility. It is an outcome that creates \na number of possible problems. The most obvious perhaps is that the power of \nproviders to encourage individuals to take responsibility for their conduct \nthrough conditionality in their housing provision is weakened. Protected by the \nlegislation, at least in the absence of a risk to health or safety, an individual \nthat might be judged capable of exercising responsible moral agency will no \nlonger be amenable to exclusion from social housing as a technology of self. \nNor will it possible to discipline him through the act of exclusion itself. Arden, \nhowever, has a different concern. His suggestion is that the legislation harms \nnot only housing providers but, ironically, the mentally disordered themselves. \nHe notes first the possible negative impact of the DDA upon perceptions of the \nmentally disordered. Enabling them to avoid responsibility for their anti-social \nconduct, where it may be deemed to exist under a moral adjudication, might \n 44\nlead to hostility towards those assumed to have unfairly \u2018got away with it\u2019. He \nthen goes on to question whether it may patronise the mentally disordered to \ntreat them in this way. To patronise, as to condescend, is to behave as if one is \non equal terms with another person, whilst maintaining an attitude of \nsuperiority. Whilst the legislation ostensibly promotes the equality of the \nmentally disordered, in practice it seems to confirm their inferiority by \nassuming, prejudicially, that they are inherently non-responsible agents.  \nSecuring the dignity of minority groups lies at the heart of anti-\ndiscrimination law.141 The enactment of the DDA was expected by the \nDisability Rights Movement to secure dignity for the disabled by promoting \ntheir equality. Brian Doyle, for example, argued as follows in support of civil \nrights:  \n \n\u2018Throughout history disabled people have experienced social \ndiscrimination, segregation and exclusion. They have been characterized \nas incomplete or defective human beings, subjected at one extreme to \nneglect, persecution and death, and at the other extreme to charity, social \nwelfare and paternalism\u2019.142  \n \nBy treating non-responsibility as the natural concomitant of a mental disorder, \nhowever, the DDA arguably characterises protected individuals indiscriminately \nas incomplete or defective human beings. The blanket protection from \nexclusion from social housing provided to them, at least where they do not \n 45\nconstitute a risk to health or safety, appears to amount then to just the sort of \npaternalism that these campaigners have sought to prevent. Interestingly, \ncommentators are also increasingly disillusioned by the medical model itself, \nfor impinging upon the dignity of the mentally disordered in this way. As Veatch \npoints out: \n \n\u2018They recognise that to place an individual in the medical model is to \nremove blame, but to remove blame is to remove responsibility, and to \nremove responsibility is to challenge the dignity of the individual\u2019.143 \n \nThe DDA restricts the opportunity for social landlords to encourage the \nmentally disordered to take responsibility for their conduct through \nconditionality of housing provision, either as a technology of self or as a \ndisciplinary technique. What is interesting is that this restriction appears to \nextend the DDA beyond the appropriate boundaries of anti-discrimination \nlegislation. The primary liberal justification for contemporary discrimination law \nis the promotion of equal treatment of those who, because of a particular \nstatus, would otherwise be treated unjustly less favourably than others.144 \nSandra Fredman expands upon this conception of equality: \n \n\u2018A key contribution of liberal equality has been its insistence that \nindividuals should be judged according to their personal qualities. This \nbasic tenet is contravened if individuals are subjected to detriment on the \n 46\nbasis only of their status, their group membership, or irrelevant physical \ncharacteristics\u2019.145 \n \nA particular protected \u2018status\u2019 should not form the basis of less favourable \ntreatment because it is extrinsic to a person\u2019s \u2018personal qualities\u2019: it is irrelevant \nbecause it has no bearing upon the merits (or demerits) of the individual \nhimself. The distinction between status and personal quality is an \nuncontroversial dichotomy when applied to physical conditions such as race \nand sex. In relation to mental disorder, however, the distinction becomes \nblurred by the question of responsibility. If an individual is adjudicated as \nresponsible for conduct, notwithstanding diagnosis of a causal mental disorder, \nit is arguable that his anti-social conduct should be treated as a personal \nquality, rather than part of his status as a disabled person. It should therefore \nappropriately form the basis of the same treatment as non-disabled individuals \nwho behave in the same way.  \nIt is notable, finally, that the framers of the DDA appear to have \nproblematized this assumption of non-responsibility themselves. During the \npassage of the DDA through Parliament, William Hague made clear that he \nwould ensure that \u2018psychopathic or antisocial disorders and addictions\u2019, such \nas \u2018kleptomania, pyromania, paedophilia and personality disorders\u2019 would not \nbe protected by the legislation.146 The Disability Discrimination (Meaning of \nDisability) Regulations 1996 provided consequently that certain personality \ndisorders - a tendency to set fires, to steal or to physical or sexual abuse, \n 47\nexhibitionism or voyeurism - were excluded from the meaning of disability,147 \ntogether with addictions to alcohol, nicotine or other substances, unless \ncaused by medical treatment.148 Of course, the 1996 Regulations clearly were \nnot aimed at securing the dignity of the mentally disordered. Instead, imposing \nresponsibility upon these particular individuals reflects a knee-jerk, politically-\nmotivated moral adjudication of certain social demons who would attract public \noutrage should they be allowed the benefits of protection from discrimination. \nWhat the exceptions do reveal though is a suspicion of the medical status of \npersonality disorders. Further, the exclusion of addictions, aside from those not \nbrought about by the individual himself, suggests subscription to the theory of \nmeta-responsibility. However, the regulations do not exclude all personality \ndisorders. Nor do they seem to deal with questions of responsibility that might \narise from dual diagnosis. Even if the substance misuse amounts to an \naddiction, which will not always be the case, anti-social behaviour will still be \nrelated to some extent to the underlying medical condition and will therefore \nfall within the ambit of the DDA. \n \n(6) Reprioritising welfarism? \n \nThe accusation that the DDA patronises the mentally disordered by \nfreeing them from responsibility for their conduct reflects the concern of \nadvanced liberalism with the fostering of responsible moral agency. It is \nquestionable, however, whether an adjudication of moral responsibility on the \n 48\npart of these individuals is best responded to through conditionality in housing \nprovision. That responsibility can be causally attributed to an individual does \nnot necessarily provide grounds for the blame of that individual.149 It is another \nquestion entirely whether he should be subjected to exclusion from his home \nas a result. We have seen that \u2018anti-social\u2019 individuals protected by the DDA \nshare one important characteristic: they are at particular risk of social exclusion \nbecause their mental impairments substantially affect their capacity to carry out \nday-to-day activities. As the SEU report suggests, to tackle the social exclusion \nexperienced by the mentally disordered it is necessary to get the basics of \nhousing provision right. Encouraging responsible moral agency through \nconditionality is of little value relative to this objective. It is contended then that, \nin the context of conditionality at least, the DDA is a welcome return to \nwelfarism within the sector. \nIt is questionable too whether the assumption of non-responsibility in \nthese circumstances is necessarily at odds with the aims of anti-discrimination \nlegislation. In fact, equal treatment is not the only appropriate objective for \nsuch instruments. Departure from the principle is often justified as a way to \nensure substantive or redistributive goals.150 Collins develops this idea by \nsuggesting that legislators should be able to depart from the principle of \nequality when to do so promotes the distributive aim of greater social \ninclusion.151 It might be argued then that departure from the principle of \nequality treatment is warranted in order to ensure that the mentally disordered \nare provided with the housing services required to engage effectively with \n 49\nsociety, whether or not this prevents them from taking responsibility for their \nactions through conditionality in their housing provision.152 We have seen that \nin this instance the DDA promotes less favourable treatment of the minority, \nrather than majority, group. It operates as such as a source of positive \ndiscrimination in favour of the mentally disordered. Indeed, Arden\u2019s argument \nthat it is patronising towards minority groups is often directed towards \nlegislation which explicitly engages in affirmative action. It is contended that \nthis outcome was clearly unintended by the framers of the DDA. However, \nunder the redistributive objective of social inclusion, it might be argued that \nquality of outcome (securing adequate housing) justifies more favourable \ntreatment of the minority group (precluding consideration of their responsibility \nfor anti-social conduct).  \nOf course, the re-prioritisation of welfarism through anti-discrimination \nlegislation not only requires that individuals are absolved from responsibility for \ntheir conduct through conditionality, but that providers and other residents \nunderwrite the risks that they might pose. We have seen that the Court of \nAppeal in Romano acted to allow providers to justify less favourable treatment \non grounds of the low-level risks associated with anti-social behaviour. It might \nbe argued finally, however, that the benefit of secure housing for the mentally \ndisordered, the dubious practical benefits of exclusion of the mentally \ndisordered from social housing for anti-social behaviour, and additionally the \nfact that only those dependent upon the tenure for their accommodation are \nliable for the loss of their home on ground of their conduct,153 supports a higher \n 50\njustificatory risk standard than that set by the Court. Indeed, whilst we have \nseen that it is the human right of other residents to be protected from low-level \ndisorder, legislation that demands that social landlords and other residents \nunderwrite a higher proportion of the risks associated with mental disorder will \nstill satisfy the European Convention. It is clear that a wide margin of \nappreciation exists for Parliament to legislate in areas of social policy, allowing \nfor the rights and interests of others.154 The interest in securing stable housing \nof those whose mental impairment makes them particularly vulnerable to social \nexclusion is surely proportionate in these circumstances. \n \n(7) Conclusion \n \nThis paper has explored the restrictions imposed by sections 22 to 24 of \nthe DDA upon the governance of anti-social tenants through conditionality in \nhousing provision. It has contended that the legislation conflicts with the \nobjectives of advanced liberal housing policy, by reprioritising the need of the \nmentally disordered for social housing above the management of risk, and the \nshaping of responsible moral agency, through exclusion. It has explored in \nparticular the argument that to absolve the mentally disordered indiscriminately \nfrom the obligations of conditionality is an affront to their dignity because many \nare capable of taking responsibility for their conduct. It has suggested, \nhowever, that social inclusion of the mentally disordered through the securing \nstable tenancies is of such fundamental importance that they should be \n 51\nexempt from conditionality. This should still be subject to a risk justification, but \narguably set at a higher standard than that currently set by the Court of Appeal \nin Romano. Moreover, it is not internally inconsistent for anti-discrimination \nlegislation to engage in positive discrimination by preventing landlords from \nexcluding individuals in this way. There may be a place then for the protections \ncurrently afforded under the DDA to the mentally disordered threatened with \nexclusion from rented housing on grounds of their anti-social conduct.  \nWe have seen, however, that numerous other problems are created for \nhousing providers by sections 22 to 24. In relation to the control of anti-social \nbehaviour, we saw earlier that the legislation may preclude social landlords \nfrom enforcing injunctions or ASBOs against the mentally disordered. It is \nsuggested that the DDA has extended here beyond its appropriate remit. The \nfocus of sections 22 to 24 is the support of access to premises. Neither the \nimposition of an injunction or ASBO impinges upon this objective. The \ninclusion of these tools should be seen instead as an unintended consequence \nof the overly broad notion of \u2018detriment\u2019 employed by the legislation. A further \nconcern is that supported housing providers may be prevented from evicting or \nrefusal to allocate in the best interests of the individual or the housing project. \nThis may have to be dealt with through an exception for such projects. Finally, \nI want to return to a concern, raised earlier, that in the absence of an economic \njustification for less favourable treatment landlords are precluded by the DDA \nfrom evicting individuals from social housing for rent arrears on evidence of a \ncausal mental impairment. This paradigm is particularly susceptible to criticism \n 52\n 53\nunder advanced liberal housing policy. It can be criticised first on grounds of \nrisk to the financial viability of a particular housing organisation. Without \nmodification such an application of DDA may well give rise to a challenge \nunder Protocol 1, Article 1 of the European Convention,155 as a landlord will \neffectively be deprived of his property without compensation. Moreover, the \nDDA also provides no opportunity for consideration of the responsibility of an \nindividual for his or her condition. The DDA may once again be said to \npatronise him, by associating classification of a mental disorder with an \nabsolute inability to manage one\u2019s financial affairs.156 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 54\n                                                                                                                                             \n\u2022 Department of Law, University of Durham, 50 North Bailey, Durham DH1 3ET. \n1 The 2005 Act is now partially in force: Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (Commencement No 1) \nOrder 2005.  \n2 C Gooding, Blackstone\u2019s guide to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (London: Blackstone Press, \n1995), p 2. \n3 [2004] EWCA Civ 834. \n4 See generally M Foucault, \u2018Governmentality\u2019 in G Burchell, C Gordon and P Miller (eds) The \nFoucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991), pp 87-\n104. \n5 N Rose, \u2018Governing \u201cadvanced\u201d liberal democracies\u2019 in A Barry, T Osborne and N Rose (eds) \nFoucault and Political Reason: Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Rationalities of Government (London: \nUCL Press, 1996), pp 37-64.
