Finite element analysis has been used to develop three\ninnovative rolling methods that reduce residual stress and distortion in friction stir welds. Of the\nthree methods, Post-Weld Direct Rolling (PWDR) where a single roller is applied to roll the top\nsurface of the weld after the weld metal has cooled to room temperature proved the most effective.\nThe residual stress predictions from the model compared favourably with residual stress\nmeasurements reported in an accompanying paper. Finally, the effectiveness of using PWDR is\nillustrated with an industrial example of a large integrally stiffened panel, where the distortion was\nvirtually eliminated.\nKeywords: Rolling, Friction stir weld, Residual stress, Distortion, Finite element modelling\n3INTRODUCTION\nFriction stir welding (FSW) was developed in early 1990s [1], and has been described in detail in\nMishra and Ma [2]. The process is generally considered to have a low heat input which gives\nexcellent mechanical properties, and low residual stress and distortion in aluminium alloys.\nAlthough residual stress and distortion are often lower than equivalent fusion welds, they are often\nsufficiently high to prevent industrial application. Therefore it is necessary to understand the\nformation and control of residual stress and distortion. The residual stresses in FSW have been\ninvestigated by many authors including Sutton et al. [3], who carried out three-dimensional residual\nstress mapping of 2024-T3 aluminium alloy using the neutron diffraction technique. The largest\nresidual stress component was found to be the longitudinal residual stress, which is generally\nslightly higher on the advancing than retreating side of the tool. To study the formation of residual\nstresses in friction stir welds Feng et al. [4] proposed an integrated thermal\u2013metallurgical\u2013\nmechanical modelling approach based on the commercial general purpose finite element (FE)\ncode ABAQUS. Other numerical modelling and experimental work showed the influence of the\nwelding process parameters and the release of fixtures on residual stresses in friction stir welds of\nstainless steel 304L [5] and aluminium alloy 2024-T4 [6].\nTo reduce or eliminate weld residual stress and therefore distortion, the final residual stress needs\nto be reduced or eliminated. This may be done by using a lower heat input process [7], stress\nengineering or post-processing. The stress engineering methods are those that can be used during\nan existing process to lower the residual stress and distortion. These methods rely on the\napplication of a tensile stress which either reduces the compressive yielding around the weld zone\nor induces a tensile stretch in the material after welding [8]. Among all the stress engineering tools\ninvestigated, it appears that for friction stir welds, rolling represents the greatest potential for\nresidual stress and distortion reduction [9-11]. This is because the technique can be relatively\neasily applied using the large, stiff structure provided by a typical FSW machine [11].\n4The application of rolling to reduce weld residual stress and distortion is not new. Early work in\nRussia [12, 13] demonstrated the effectiveness of In-Situ Direct Rolling (ISDR) which is shown in\nFig. 1(b). The authors showed that the method effectively reduced residual stress and distortion\nand gave guidance on the design of the rolling equipment. Kurkin et al. [13] showed that the\ncombined effect of directly rolling after the weld as well as an additional cold rolling afterwards was\nthe most effective way to maximise the mechanical properties, and minimise distortion. Liu et al.\n[14] used a different rolling method, namely synchronous rolling to reduce the likelihood of hot\ncracking during GTAW welding of high strength aluminium alloy. The system that they employed\nwas similar to the In-Situ Roller Tensioning (ISRT) set-up (as shown in Fig. 1(a)) that was\nproposed for investigation in the current study for residual stress and distortion reduction in FSW.\nAnother technique using a trailing impact rolling device was presented by Xu et al. [15] for\nprevention of hot cracking in TIG welding of aluminium alloy thin-shell structures. This trailing\nimpact rolling device was also used for the control of weld residual stress and distortion as well as\nprevention of weld hot cracking [16, 17].\nIn more recent work [9-11] ISRT and Post-Weld Direct Rolling (PWDR) are described. PWDR (as\nshown in Fig. 1(c)) is similar to ISDR, however it differs in that the rolling process is done after the\ncomponent has been welded rather than in-situ. Altenkirch et al. [10] measured the residual stress\nand described how the method works by plastically compressing the material in the normal\ndirection (thickness) which results in a plastic elongation in the longitudinal (rolling\/welding)\ndirection. This elongation enables the tensile longitudinal residual stress to be reduced or\neliminated and where significant yielding occurs, a compressive longitudinal residual stress can be\ninduced. Although both methods were intended to reduce distortion, Altenkirch et al. [10] found\nthat only the PWDR was effective. Note that Altenkirch et al. [10] used the term \u2018PWRT\u2019 instead of\n\u2018PWDR\u2019.\nThis paper will present the FE modelling used in the development of the roller system that was\ndiscussed in previous publications [9-11]. Finite Element Analysis can either be used as a\n5predictive tool for use in design studies, or as a tool for post-mortem analysis. Typically, most\nmodels reported in the published literature are used for post-mortem analysis. The post-mortem\nmodel represents the actual welding conditions as near as possible, and a close match with\nexperiments is usually found. The modelling work presented in this study was used for design\npurposes, so the actual FSW welding parameters, heat input, material type, and boundary\nconditions differed from those in the experiment. Therefore trends in the model predictions will be\ncompared with the experimental results.\nMETHOD\nFE models were constructed in ABAQUS and used to evaluate the three rolling methods, namely\nIn-Situ Roller Tensioning (ISRT), In-Situ Direct Rolling (ISDR) and Post-Weld Direct Rolling\n(PWDR), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The test plate used for the modelling analysis was\n2024-T3 aluminium alloy of size 500\u00d7250\u00d73.2mm. The temperature-dependent material properties\nwere the same as those reported in Richards et al. [18]. The same set of data has been used for\nboth the weld and parent material in this study and no material softening was considered for the\nweld metal.\nDue to symmetry (the mechanical loads on the material during FSW were ignored), only half of the\nplate geometry was considered in the FE modelling analysis. Fig. 2 shows the FE mesh used in\nthis study including the plane of symmetry. To minimise the CPU time, the thermal-mechanical\nloading during the friction stir welding and the roller tensioning\/rolling processes were only applied\nto a 165 mm long section in the centre of the plate. Fig. 2 also shows how the mesh in this region\nwas refined to a width of 60 mm in order to ensure the accuracy of the FE results.\nIn the present FE analysis, all the rolls were treated as an analytically defined rigid surface. The\nbottom plane of the workpiece was vertically restrained to represent the effect of the backing bar.\nThis constraint was kept active throughout the various modelling steps for consistent residual\nstress evaluation. Meanwhile, symmetry boundary conditions were applied at the plane of\n6symmetry as shown in Fig. 2. The FE simulation of rolling was achieved by pulling the leading\nedge of the workpiece (displacement controlled loading, Fig. 2) while pressing the roll against the\ntop surface of the workpiece with a prescribed force or displacement. Coulomb friction was\nassumed at the contact surface between the roll and workpiece with a friction coefficient of 0.1.\nAll the models of the FSW process used a welding speed was 300mm\/min with a 5 second dwell\ntime at the start. It was assumed that the FSW tool had a shoulder diameter of 18 mm with a\nconical pin of about 3.2 mm in length, and the root and tip diameter of the conical pin were\nrespectively 4 and 2 mm. A sequentially coupled thermal-mechanical modelling approach similar to\nthat employed by Richards et al. [18] was adopted. In the thermal modelling that was performed\nfirst, the heat input model developed by Richards et al. [18] was modified and adjusted to match\nthe welding conditions in the current study. A constant volumetric heat flux of 1.2\u00d7106 kW\/m3 was\napplied to a conical area in the weld panel directly underneath the FSW tool. In the mechanical\nmodelling that followed, the temperature predictions from the thermal model were used to calculate\nthe thermal load due to material expansion and contraction and hence the final residual stress.\nBoth the thermal and mechanical models used the same FE mesh shown in Fig. 2. This modelling\napproach does not consider the mechanical interaction between the workpiece and the FSW tool.\nThe important geometric parameters for the roller designs are shown in Fig. 1 (note that the width,\nB and depth, D of the rolls apply equally to PWDR and ISDR) and the corresponding values used\nin the FE models are given in Table 1. Two conditions were used for the FE simulation of ISRT.\nBoth conditions used a prescribed roller displacement to achieve a target rolling reduction of 0.5%,\nbut with different distances between the tool and roller, DY of 15 mm and 25 mm. The 0.5%\nreduction corresponds to a rolling load of approximately 68 kN. Although neither of these\ndistances could be implemented practically due to interference between the roller and FSW tool,\nthe analysis aided understanding of the ISRT method.\n7As mentioned previously, direct rolling may be applied directly after FSW tool (ISDR), or after the\nweld has cooled to room temperature (PWDR). In the modelling of ISDR, the roller was applied 25\nmm behind the FSW tool with prescribed loads of 10, 20 and 30kN. Once again, this condition\ncannot be implemented practically due to interference between the roller and the tool. The main\nreasons for choosing this small trailing distance was the limited size of the model weld length\n(165mm). The analysis nevertheless provided a useful comparison with other rolling methods.\nFinally, the FE analysis was performed for PWDR with loads of 10, 32.5 and 43 kN respectively.\nThe results together with the workpiece deformation characteristics in terms of weld shape and\nrolling reduction will be discussed in the next section.\nRESULTS\nEffect of FSW\nFig. 3(a) shows the temperature distribution during welding predicted by the FE simulation. The\npeak temperature predicted by the model is just under 400 \u00b0C. This compared well with predictions\nmade by previous investigators under similar modelling conditions [19, 20]. Colegrove et al. [19]\nused a simple axisymmetric flow model to predict heat generation and temperature in FSW of 3.2\nmm thick 2024-T351 plate. Given the solidus temperature of alloy 2024 being 502 \u00b0C, they\npredicted that for a travel speed of 400 mm\/min the peak temperatures in the weld root and near\nthe tool shoulder were between 390 and 490 \u00b0C for increasing tool rotational speed from 400 to\n1600 rpm. In another attempt, Schmidt et al. [20] employed a 3D FE modelling approach in order to\nconsider the contact condition at the tool\/matrix interface for heat generation. The workpiece was a\n3 mm thick 2024-T3 plate and the welding speed was 120 mm\/min with 400 rpm tool rotation\nspeed. The peak temperature that they predicted was 449 \u00b0C at the advancing side closest to the\nprobe\/shoulder corner. Although both Colegrove et al. [19] and Schmidt et al. [20] predicted higher\npeak temperatures during similar FSW, these were mainly confined in and near the tool\/workpiece\ninterface. Whereas the current study was focused on the bulk heating effect in the weld region\nduring FSW.\n8The FE prediction of weld longitudinal residual stress after FSW and cooling down to room\ntemperature is shown in Fig. 3(b). The longitudinal residual stress profile across the weld at mid-\nthickness (along the path as marked in Fig. 3(b)) is plotted in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 3(b) and 4(a) shows\nthat the weld longitudinal residual stress induced by FSW is significant, with the maximum tensile\nlongitudinal residual stress values found near the weld approaching and even exceeding the initial\nyield stress (flow stress at zero plastic strain) of the weld material (250MPa). This FE prediction of\nresidual stress profile is generally in good agreement with typical results for similar welds reported\nby previous researchers in the literature, in particular those by Altenkirch et al. [10] on a 5mm thick\n2024-T3 FSW panel (with about 190MPa maximum tensile residual stress measured in the weld)\nand Richards et al [18] on a 3mm thick 2024-T3 FSW panel (with about 180MPa maximum tensile\nresidual stress predicted in the weld). Note the current prediction gives a slightly higher maximum\ntensile residual stress. This is partially attributed to the geometry and constraint conditions adopted\nin the FE model, and partially due to the fact that no material softening was included in the model\nwhich will significantly affect the result [18]. However, it should not hinder the purpose of the\npresent investigation, which was to demonstrate the relative effect of the different rolling methods\non the final residual stress distributions in the friction stir welds.\nInfluence of ISRT\nThe longitudinal residual stress profiles for both roller tensioning conditions (DY = 15mm and\n25mm) evaluated along the path across the weld panel through the mid-thickness are plotted in\nFig. 4(b) and compared with that of the as welded condition. The model predicted a small reduction\nin the longitudinal tensile residual stress in the weld region as well as significant compressive\nstresses either side of this. The effect of moving the roller closer to FSW tool was marginal. The\naverage rolling force predicted by the FE simulation was about 68kN for both cases. The analysis\nalso indicated that there was some minor permanent deformation produced by the rollers, which\nreduced the thickness by up to about 0.6% as shown in Fig. 5. It is expected that by increasing the\nrolling force, the tensile residual stress in the weld could be further reduced. However, this will\n9undoubtedly cause excessive deformation in the roll path which would be undesirable and\ncomplicate the weld distortion response, and therefore not recommended.\nInfluence of ISDR\nThe longitudinal residual stresses are plotted across the mid-section for the three rolling loads in\nFig. 4 (c) and compared with the as-welded condition. This shows a significant reduction in tensile\nresidual stress in the weld which increases with rolling load. Interestingly, the FE model also\npredicted a tensile residual stress peak away from the weld centreline, and the value of this peak\ndecreases with the increase of the rolling load.\nInfluence of PWDR\nThe longitudinal residual stress plotted across the mid-section are shown in Fig. 4(d) for all three\npost welding rolling conditions and are compared with the as-welded condition. Fig. 4(d) shows\nthat the maximum tensile longitudinal residual stress in the weld decreases rapidly with increasing\nrolling load. In addition, a significant amount of compressive longitudinal residual stress is\nproduced in the weld region with the minimum value being in the centre for the lower rolling load\n(10kN) which then moves to the side of the weld centreline for the higher rolling loads (32.5 and\n43kN).\nThe Weld Profile\nThe previous section showed that the final weld longitudinal residual stress is very sensitive to the\nrolling force employed during the various rolling techniques, especially the ISDR and PWDR\nmethods. It is therefore important to understand the effect of rolling on the weld profile. Fig. 5\nshows a selection of the predicted change in weld panel thickness after welding and rolling. The\nthickness of the as-welded condition increases slightly in the weld area. This is mainly due to the\nrestraint imposed by the surrounding material as the material expands and contracts during\nwelding. The maximum increase is about 0.1mm in the centre of the weld, which corresponds to\nabout 3% of the initial plate thickness (3.2mm). It is recognised that the actual weld profile is\n10\nstrongly influenced by the material movement and loading from the FSW tool during welding.\nIncluding this effect in the model is highly complex and so it was not considered in the simple\nmodelling approach adapted in this work. Nevertheless this artefact of the model needs to be\nconsidered when interpreting the results.\nThe rolling processes all reduce the as-welded thickness increase to varying degrees, with the\nprocess that uses the highest rolling force (i.e. PWDR with 43kN) also giving the largest reduction\nin thickness (by a maximum of about 2.5% in the weld centre, Fig. 5) as well as in residual stress\n(virtually reverted all the tensile residual stress in the weld area into compression, Fig. 4(d))..\nDISCUSSION\nComparison between Rolling Processes\nThe FE modelling has demonstrated that each of the three rolling methods can effectively reduce\nthe as-welded residual stress, and of the three methods, PWDR is the most effective. The\nreduction in longitudinal residual stress with ISRT (Fig. 4(b) was marginal (about 20%) indicating\nthat the amount of roller tensioning in the weld region was minimal. More interestingly, the model\nalso predicted a large compressive region beside this, which was undoubtedly produced by the\nrollers compressing this material. This compressive stress was sufficiently large to produce a\nsmall tensile stress in the far field, i.e. at distances greater than 40 mm. Although distortion was\nnot predicted by the model, it could be significantly reduced by ISRT because buckling distortion\nwill be inhibited by the tensile stresses to either side of the large compressive region.\nThe ISDR results in Fig. 4(c) show a more significant reduction in the longitudinal residual stress in\nthe centre of the weld area, although the peak value with the 10kN load is very similar to the as-\nwelded condition. The peak tensile residual stress decreases rapidly with the increase of the ISDR\nload. In addition, the location of the peak also moves away from the weld centreline as the ISDR\nload increases from 7mm at 10kN to 12mm at 30kN. The latter result is likely to be an artefact of\nthe thickness change predicted by the model in the as-welded condition (Fig. 5), i.e. after welding\n11\nthe thickness of the material increases. Therefore, when the roll is applied to the weld, the greatest\nload and greatest deformation will be along the weld centreline, i.e. the deformation will not be\napplied uniformly under the roller. This is the cause of the higher reduction in longitudinal residual\nstress along the weld centreline. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that, unlike PWDR which\ngives a high compressive residual stress in the rolled (weld) area, ISDR can give minimal (close to\nzero) longitudinal residual stress levels in the rolled area. As shown in Fig. 4(c), for the 30kN rolling\nforce case it may be possible to further eliminate the spike in the longitudinal residual stress profile\nnear the edge of the rolling path by a specific roller design and loading strategy, and thus produce\nan ultimate residual stress free weld.\nThe results for the 10kN force PWDR in Fig. 4(d) are similar to the ISDR results in that there is a\nminimum value along the weld centreline, followed by a tensile peak 8mm away from the weld\ncentreline. The cause is likely to be the same as for ISDR. The main difference with the ISDR\nresults is the significantly lower longitudinal residual stress predicted along the weld centreline for\nthe same rolling load, i.e. -220MPa vs 40MPa. On first inspection this is perhaps a little surprising\nas one may have expected greater deformation of the weld region with the hot, soft material in\nISDR. This is indeed reflected in the plot of the thickness change in Fig. 5. However, it must be\nremembered that the material is rolled while it is still relatively warm, so the material will contract\n(causing a tensile stretch) as it cools to room temperature. Therefore the predicted longitudinal\nresidual stress with ISDR is higher than PWDR.\nThe tensile peak away from the weld is eliminated with higher rolling loads with PWDR. In this\ncase the roller load is likely to be sufficiently high to obtain full contact with the plate, resulting in a\nmore uniform stress state underneath the roller. The cause of the small rise in longitudinal residual\nstress along the weld centreline, which is particularly noticeable with the highest (43kN) load is\nunclear.\nComparison with Experiments\n12\nAs mentioned earlier, the residual stress of rolled welds has been measured by neutron diffraction\nby Altenkirch et al. [10] for similar friction stir welds with both the ISRT (5mm thick 2024-T3 alloy)\nand PWDR (5mm thick 2199-T8) methods. Unlike the FE modelling results, the experiments\nshowed that ISRT had no effect on the final longitudinal residual stress distribution in the weld [10].\nTo understand why this may be the case, Table 2 compares the materials and rolling conditions\nused in the experiments with those used in the FE modelling. There are obviously many\ndifferences, but the most significant one is the trailing distance between the weld and rollers. In\nthe model this was varied between 15 and 25 mm, while the minimum distance that could be\nachieved in practice was 40 mm. As stated in Altenkirch et al. [10] this greater distance, in\ncombination with the cooling effect of the rollers themselves (which is not considered in the model)\nis likely to mean that the material will be too cool to plastically yield in the experiments. This is\nsupported by the fact that no significant and consistent compressive residual stress was observed\nin the rolling path [10]. Further increasing the rolling load may cause plastic deformation in the\nmaterial and hence result in the beneficial effects, however this was not attempted due to the\noverall loading capacity of the FSW machine being reached.\nBetter agreement was obtained between the PWDR experimental, as shown in Fig. 6, and\nmodelling results, Fig. 4(d). Although there were differences in the detail of the longitudinal residual\nstresses predicted which could be due to the different materials and thickness used, there was\nbroad agreement in the following aspects:\n\u2022 Increasing compressive stress with the increase of the applied load, although once it\nreaches a minimum value no further reduction was achieved.\n\u2022 A widening of the compressive stress area produced by the roller as the roll load\nincreased.\n\u2022 A tensile longitudinal residual stress region to either side of the central compressive\nlongitudinal residual stress region.\n13\nWith respect to the last point, the previous section has already described how this is likely to be\ncaused by the camber on the top surface of the weld predicted by the model. This may also be the\ncause of the effect in the experiments, although the material movement induced by the tool\nshoulder will probably lead to a flatter surface than in the model, so the effect is less pronounced.\nTo obtain a more even longitudinal residual stress profile, a slightly profiled roller could be\nintroduced accordingly in order to induce more uniform deformation across the weld.\nFinally Kurkin et al. [13] compared the reduction in distortion of ISDR with PWDR and showed that\nthe latter produced the largest reduction in distortion. This confirms the finding of the current FE\nmodel which predicted that the final residual stress was lower for PWDR with equivalent rolling\nload.\nAPPLICATION TO A LARGE AEROSPACE COMPONENT\nBecause of the effectiveness of the PWDR method shown by the FE simulation, the technique was\napplied to the FSW of a large integrally stiffened panel for the manufacture of an aerospace\ncomponent. The initial single panel size was 3.8 x 0.228 m and six of these were welded together\nto produce the final 3.8 x 1.37 m panel. After FSW, the panel had more than 21 mm out-of-plane\ndistortion (Fig. 9), causing difficulty when subsequently machining the panel to shape. To eliminate\nthe distortion, the five welds were sequentially rolled. Fig. 7 shows the test set-up just before the\nstart of the PWDR process with the direction and sequence of the FSW and PWDR clearly marked.\nA close-up view of the roller system is given in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 gives the result from the distortion\nassessment of the full panel joined with FSW before and after PWDR, showing clearly the\neffectiveness of the rolling process in reducing the weld distortion (from a maximum out-of-plane\ndistortion of more than 21 mm down to less than 3.5 mm). After rolling, the panel appeared virtually\nflat considering its size and was easily machined to the designed component shape, and no\nadditional distortion was produced by the machining process.\nCONCLUSIONS\n14\nFE models of three rolling methods, namely ISRT, ISDR and PWDR, have been applied to roll\nfriction stir welds and used to understand the reduction in residual stress induced by FSW. There\nwas a reduction in the longitudinal residual stress with all methods which increased with the\nincrease in rolling load. Of the three methods PWDR was the most effective. This method is also\neasier to implement in practice. An experimental investigation in an accompanying paper [10]\nconfirmed that PWDR was the more effective method and broadly confirmed the changes in\nlongitudinal residual stress with similar rolling forces as those employed in the modelling analysis\nof this study. The experiments indicated that ISDR had no effect on the longitudinal residual stress,\nunlike the model which indicated a small reduction.\nFinally the success of PWDR led to the implementation of the technique on a large integrally\nstiffened panel joined by FSW for aerospace applications. This work showed a significant reduction\nin the weld distortion. It is believed that PWDR will be an enabling technology for the\nimplementation of FSW in the aerospace sector.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding form the Technology Strategy Board.\nREFERENCES\n1.
