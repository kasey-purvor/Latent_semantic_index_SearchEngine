The sector is interesting since the contrast between its pre neoliberal\nand post neo-liberal characteristics is particularly stark. This paper explores the\nimpacts of neo-liberalism in European telecommunications, placing particular focus\non the EU institutional context. It considers the conseqences of neo-liberalism as ideology, on the one hand, and practice, on the other. It finds that, ideologically, neoliberalism has become deeply pervasive in European telecommunications and for its\nadvocates can be regarded as a highly successful project spanning almost 30 years. In terms of practice, the paper argues that the pursuit of neo-liberalism has been less\nsuccessful. In particular, competition has proven complex and difficult to create and\nthere are concerns over the ability of the neo-liberal model to provide sufficient\ninvestment to deliver new Next Generation Networks. However, these deficiencies\ntend to be under-played due to the ideological and rhetorical success of the neo-liberal project in telecommunications.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Paper presented to the European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group\non Regulatory Governance Second Biennial Conference, \u2018(Re)Regulation in the Wake\nof Neoliberalism.
