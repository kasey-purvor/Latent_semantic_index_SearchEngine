Fletcher, T.S. Baines & D. Harrison\nAbstract\nIn most manufacturing systems the contribution of human labour remains a vital\nelement that affects overall performance and output. Workers\u2019 individual performance\nis known to be a product of personal attitudes to work. However, in current system\ndesign processes worker performance variability is assumed to be largely insignificant\nand the potential impact of their attitudes is ignored. This paper describes a field study\nthat investigated the extent to which workers\u2019 production task cycle times vary and the\ndegree to which such variations are associated with attitude differences. Results show\nthat worker performance varies significantly, much more than is assumed by\ncontemporary manufacturing systems designers and that this appears to be due to\nproduction task characteristics. The findings of this research and their implications are\ndiscussed.\n1. Introduction\nIn the manufacturing industry, achieving organisational goals and competitive\nadvantage is highly dependant on the efficiency of manufacturing systems. The design\nof these systems is therefore critical. However, because these systems consist of many\nhuman and technological elements it is difficult for designers to accurately predict how\nall of the elements will function when integrated together. In particular, there is a lack\nof appreciation during the manufacturing system design processes of how the workers\nwithin such systems behave.\nManufacturing systems designers are usually well trained technically but do not possess\na comparable understanding of human issues. They tend to treat human performance in\na similar way to machine functions by using \u2018standard time\u2019 parameters for evaluations\nand assume that any performance variations are accounted for by the time study\ntechniques that are employed to derive these times. Human performance variation is not\nexpected to exceed standard time parameters in normal conditions. This is especially the\ncase where production tasks are simplified, short, repetitive, and in addition are\nconstrained by automated processes. Although much research has studied relationships\nbetween behaviour and psychosocial variables, well-known effects of worker attitudes\non performance are also neglected. Hence, a better understanding of such factors at the\nsystem design stage should help to deliver Manufacturing Systems which meet\nexpectations.\n2This paper describes a study that investigated the extent of variation in workers\u2019\nperformance of production tasks and sought to establish how such variations may be\nassociated with worker attitudes. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2\nsummarises the background to the research problem and explains in greater depth how\nmanufacturing system design has come to consider workers; Section 3 describes the\nresearch method employed in this study; Section 4 presents the results gained from an\nextensive study of a large manufacturing system; Section 5 provides a discussion of the\nresults, the implications for system design, and recommendations for further work in\nthis area.\n2. Background\nHuman work in many modern manufacturing systems has been progressively simplified\nand regulated, however worker variability and worker attitudes are still of significant\nimpact to system performance. However, these are not sufficiently accounted for in the\nsystem design process. The problem is that there is a paucity of work that has\nthoroughly investigated the extent to which worker performance really does vary within\nmodern manufacturing system designs. This section provides a background to these\narguments.\n2.1 The simplification and standardisation of human work in manufacturing systems\nThe development of mass production techniques and large factory systems after the\nindustrial revolution (c.1770) converted manufacturing workers from craftsmen\nproducing entire products to factory operators who only perform isolated production\ntasks in interactions with machines (Mortimer, 1985; Parker and Wall, 1996). In the\nearly 20th century, the simplification and standardisation of production work was greatly\naccelerated by industrialists who applied division of labour theory to job design time\nstudy techniques (Gilbreth, 1909) and \u2018Scientific Management\u2019 principles (Taylor,\n1911). Production tasks were made shorter and more repetitive so that they would\nrequire less skill, training and non-productive actions, thereby reducing labour costs and\nimproving efficiency (Sorcher and Meyer, 1968, Kelly, 1982; Parker et al, 2001). The\ncompetitive benefits of job simplification, deskilling labour through standardisation of\nproducts, and regulation of worker discipline were ultimately demonstrated by the\nsuccess of Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line factory system in 1913. Job simplification\ndominated the design of shop floor production tasks by the mid-20th century (Parker and\nWall, 1996).\nIn parallel, technological developments and rising human labour costs generated a\n\u201cmachine school\u201d of thought which sought to replace workers with more reliable and\ninexpensive machines wherever possible (Doyle, 2003). For example, mechanical\nindustrial power in the USA rose from 14% to 80% between 1850 and 1950 (Argyle,\n1992). It became imperative for organisations to standardise and predict human work\nperformance within these increasingly technical production systems (Nemetz and Fry,\n1998). Thus, the variability of human labour that could not be replaced by machinery\nneeded to be minimised and regulated by job simplification and interactions with\ntechnology (Mortimer, 1985; McEwan & Sackett, 1998).\n32.2 The impact of workers on manufacturing system performance\nManufacturing system designs often include production methods that combine both\nhuman labour and mechanistic processes (Buxey, 1982; Womack et al, 1990; Das,\n1999; Mital et al., 1999). Most modern technical systems are still reliant on human\nskills and cognitions (Badham, 1991; McEwan & Sackett, 1998; MacCarthy et al, 2001;\nKontogiannis and Kossiavelou, 1999). Productivity, efficiency and safety outcomes\nhave been considered greatly influenced by human interaction (Tepas, 1994; Das, 2001)\nand even the successful implementation of advanced technology itself has been found to\nbe reliant on the organisation and motivation of workers (Majchrzak, 1997).\nNevertheless, a general neglect of human issues has been cited as a key factor leading to\nthe post-1965 decline in US manufacturing productivity and competitiveness (MIT\nCommission findings; cited in: Duguay et al, 1997). Consequently, organisations have\nincreasingly adopted worker-centred practices to improve manufacturing strategy,\nquality, and inventory management (Dean and Snell, 1991) and these have been\npositively correlated with organisational effectiveness (Clegg et al, 2002).\nConsideration of worker issues is now seen as a key determinant of productivity and\nefficiency (Longenecker et al, 1998; MacCarthy et al, 2001; Das, 2001) and\n\u201csustainable competitive advantage\u201d (Youndt, 1996).\n2.3 The impact of worker attitudes on production task\nWorkers\u2019 individual differences have been consistently related to a range of work\nperformance criteria (Furnham, 1992; Viswesvaren and Ones, 2000) including the\nperformance of production tasks in manufacturing systems (Doerr et al, 2000; Doerr et\nal, 2002). Attitudes have particularly been linked to organisational performance and\neffectiveness by the \u2018human relations\u2019 approach to job design (Quinn and Rohrbaugh,\n1983) and are central to both classic and modern job design models (e.g. Hackman and\nOldham, 1976; Herzberg et al, 1959; Das, 1999; Parker et al, 2001). Furthermore,\nworker attitudes have been particularly related to a range of industrial issues, such as\ntechnology adoption (e.g. Zammuto & O\u2019Connor, 1992; Slem et al, 1995); safety (e.g.\nOliver et al, 2002); quality (e.g. Stone and Eddy, 1996); effects of shift\/night work (e.g.\nFurnham and Hughes, 1999); work group effectiveness (e.g. Bailey, 2000) and to costs\nand productivity (Norsworthy and Zabala, 1985a, Norsworthy and Zabala, 1985b; Melin\net al, 1999; Kleiner et al, 2002). Hence, work-related attitudes are clearly a key\ninfluence on performance outcomes and the efficiency of a manufacturing system.\nWorker attitudes may therefore be a useful indicator of workers\u2019 individual differences\nin respect of their organisational context\/work environment (Dormann and Zapf, 2001).\n2.4 The consideration of workers in manufacturing system design\nDesigners tend to consider workers similarly to machine functions, assuming little or no\nperformance variation between or within individual workers (Baines and Kay, 2002;\nBuzacott, 2002). This simplistic approach is due to three main interrelated reasons.\nFirst, the historical \u2018machine school\u2019 focus on technology and the reallocation of human\nfunctions has led system designers\u2019 expertise in human-related issues to become out of\nstep with their understanding of technical issues (Parasuraman, 1997; Longenecker et al,\n1998; Badham and Ehn, 2000). Second, designers do not appreciate the stochastic\n4nature of human\/social dynamics within manufacturing systems and how this increases\nsystem complexity (Mollaghasemi et al, 1998; Azadeh, 2000; Baines and Ladbrook,\n2002; Pacquet and Lin, 2003). Third, system designers assume that human variability in\nthe performance of production is too constrained and regulated by\nautomated\/mechanical functions and job simplification to exceed the standardisations\nderived from time study techniques for line balancing (Carnahan et al, 2000).\nThe success of manufacturing operations often depends on the extent to which designers\nconsider worker issues (Lehto et al, 1991). However, only basic \u2018human factors\u2019 (e.g.\nhealth and safety, ergonomics, line balancing) are typically regarded and even then at a\nlate stage of the design process (Fadier and Ciccotelli, 1999; Stahl et al, 2000; Bonney\net al, 2000 Pacquet and Lin, 2003). Therefore, in manufacturing system design\ninaccuracies may be attributable to the impact of worker variability and individual\ndifferences which are \u201cvirtually ignored\u201d (Doerr et al, 2002). Design stage evaluations\nmay, therefore, be improved by a better understanding of such issues.\n3. Research Design\n3.1 Aim and Methodology Overview\nThe aim of this research described here has been to investigate the extent to which\nworkers\u2019 production task cycle times vary and the degree to which such variations may\nbe associated with attitude differences. To address this aim our approach has been to\nfirst define a theoretical framework as a proposition of possible relationships between\nproduction task and attitude variables of the worker. This then provided the basis to\ndesign an empirical study and collect actual data to test and develop the relationships\nspeculated in this framework. Here, it was decided to employ a \u201chybrid strategy\u201d\nresearch design (Robson, 1993) that would involve a combination of quantitative and\nqualitative data collection techniques. Finally, to ensure ecological validity and\npopulation validity1, an operational manufacturing system was utilised in a field study.\n3.2 Formation of theoretical framework\nMany conceptual frameworks linking worker attitudes to performance can be found\nwithin the literature, particularly within the field of \u2018job design\u2019. However, existing\nmodels tend to comprise a \u201cuniversal list of variables\u201d that are \u201cunmanageable\u201d\n(Parker et al, 2001) and too \u201cvague\u201d (Doerr et al, 2002). It is therefore necessary to\ndevelop a theoretical framework specifically for this research which would only include\nthe most relevant context-specific variables. This meant that it was necessary to identify\nvariables to represent task performance and worker attitudes within a modern\nmanufacturing system environment. Each of these are now considered in turn.\n3.2.1 Task Performance Variable\nTo ascertain the degree to which workers\u2019 production task cycle times vary it was\nessential to identify the most suitable measure of that performance. Manufacturing\nsystems design experts, from the host organisation, were consulted and they confirmed\n1 Ecological Validity and Population validity: refers to the extent to which findings can be generalised to\nthe real world context in respect of the situation and group of people, respectively (Coolican, 1999).\n5that the most suitable indicator would be measurements of the human activity element\nof assembly line workstation cycle times.\n3.2.2 Worker Attitudes Variables\nTo ascertain which attitudes would be of most likely influence to workers\u2019 performance\nvariations the large corpus of literature concerning organisational behaviour and work\npsychology was reviewed. The literature offered a wide range of work-related attitude\nconstructs but given the specific nature of this research context the set of attitude\nconstructs concerning the quality of working life developed by Warr et al, (1979) and\nCook and Wall, (1980) were found to be most relevant. This was because these\nmeasurement scales were specifically developed on and for manual workers in the\nmanufacturing industry. They would, therefore, provide valid and reliable measures of\nattitude constructs relevant to the manufacturing worker population. From the number\nof attitude scales offered by Warr et al, (1979) and Cook and Wall, (1980) a set were\nselected for this research based on relevance to the given context; these were:\nWork-involvement: a person\u2019s attitudes towards work in general.\nIntrinsic Job Motivation: motivation to perform well in present job for personal task\nsuccess rather than for extrinsic rewards such as pay and conditions.\nPerceived Intrinsic Job Characteristics: the extent to which certain work motivation\nfactors are perceived to be present in a job.\nJob Satisfaction: satisfaction in relation to a range of work environment features from\ntwo dimensions of the job a) intrinsic factors and b) extrinsic factors.\nInterpersonal Trust at Work: good intentions toward\/confidence in other people at work\nwithin the sectors of a) work group peers and b) management.\nOrganisational Commitment: feelings of attachment to the organisation, its goals\/values,\nand one\u2019s personal role in relation to this.\n3.3 Design and execution of the empirical study\nTo measure both worker performance and attitudes variables, two parallel data\ncollection studies were devised and conducted at a UK automotive component factory\nassembly line, separated for ethical and methodological reasons. First, to avoid making\nindividual workers accountable for productivity levels it was necessary to circumvent\nany direct personal identification and association with performance data. Second, in\norder to avoid spurious data being produced by workers\u2019 behaving atypically by their\nawareness of the performance measurement it was necessary to record performance\ndiscreetly.\nTen workstations were selected from the assembly line as they were evaluated to\ndemand the greatest levels of worker effort, as opposed to more machine-led work at\nother workstations. Each selected workstation was located within a separate section of\nthe line that was operated by a different work team. As workers rotated through tasks\nwithin these sections systematically, upon the hour, the production task performance\n6times of different individuals could be identified by the hour. Therefore, recording of\nhuman task completion times enabled statistical comparisons between different\ntasks\/teams and individual workers.\nParticipants\u2019 knowledge of their involvement in a study can induce atypical behaviour\nor \u2018reactivity\u2019 (Bryman, 1988). It can also augment behaviour of the criterion measure\nas people tend to behave as they think they are supposed to in studies through \u2018demand\ncharacteristics\u2019 (Orne, 1969, Orne, 1971). It is, therefore, often more advantageous to\nemploy objective measures in performance data collection studies (Brewerton and\nMillward, 2001). It was decided that objective quantitative data concerning workers\u2019\nproduction task performance times should be derived to provide a \u2018true\u2019 measure of\nwork rate variability that was not affected by direct observation or acquiescent\nparticipation. The most suitable measurement method was therefore to electronically\nrecord complete workstation cycle times on a real production line.\nProduction task performance times at each of the selected workstations were measured\nby electronic sensors which recorded the time each product arrived and left a\nworkstation. This method provided accurate recording of the duration each product had\nspent at each of the workstations and, therefore, theoretically represented the time that\nworkers had taken to perform their given tasks on the product. After installation, and a\nshort pilot test study, the time data was recorded over a total period of 12 weeks. Care\nwas taken not to alert workers to the recordings at all installation, testing and data\ncollection stages and not to engage in any direct observations so as not to impose\nexperimenter effects that might jeopardise the accuracy of the readings. The data was\nultimately collated into an extensive database system for processing and analysis.\nThe participant sample consisted of volunteers from two shift crews from the assembly\nline workforce (n=139). The attitude survey was presented as an independent study to\nparticipants so that disclosure of the parallel work performance study did not affect\nresponses.\nIn contrast to the remote data collection method designed for the measurement of\nworker performance, outlined above, it was inevitable that workers would need to be\nsurveyed directly to measure the selected attitude constructs. However, rather than\nsimply distribute a questionnaire the attitude scales were administered via interview as\nthis would improve both the quantity and quality of responses. Additionally, by\nconducting one-to-one interviews it would be possible to record any extra qualitative\ninformation offered by participants. The interview questionnaire was therefore designed\nto not only include the items that would measure the selected attitude scales listed above\nbut also include questions that would elicit basic demographic details and encourage\ndialogue to provide richer qualitative data to support\/explain responses.\n4. Results\n4.1 Production Task Performance Study\nThe continuous 12 week recording of workstation activities produced large datasets of\nover 200,000 data points per workstation. The datasets comprised a large number of\nextreme data, outlying at minimum and maximum ends of the time spectrum, which\n7clearly signified cycle times that could not be representative of \u2018normal\u2019 production task\nperformance. The remote method of recording prevented discrimination of times that\nmight have been affected by atypical system conditions and disturbances so it was\nnecessary to remove as much spurious data as possible through a series of smoothing\nprocedures.\nMany affected data points could be removed immediately as major disturbances to\nproductions and to the workforce constitution as these were identifiable through records\nprovided by the host organisation. However, numerous extreme random data points still\nremained in the datasets that was clearly not representative of normal human work\nperformance. Figure 1 shows data collected from a single workstation over one day,\nwhere each data point signifies a completed task cycle. The clustered data points reflect\nwhere task cycles has been completed in similar times and, conversely, the outlying data\npoints reflect where the cycle has not been completed normally, perhaps due to system\ndisturbances. Given that workers rotated on the hour, the different structure of data\npoint clusters per hour in this graph clearly shows that people do have unique working\npatterns that are typical for them. The problem at this stage was to identify the data\npoints that were not representative of their typical task performance.\nFigure 1.

Although this method still did not guarantee exact identification\nof normal human performance it was a pragmatic and objective method to use in the\nabsence of exact identification.\nThe reduced smoothed workstations datasets together comprised a total number of\n214,222 data points. These were analysed through a series of different procedures to\ninvestigate Temporal Factors Effects, Real Time Ranges, and Differences Between\nCrews, Teams, and Individuals\n4.1.1 Temporal Factors Effects\nTo examine the potential effects of temporal factors the datasets were analysed using\n\u2018compare means\u2019 methods, i.e. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and t-test procedures.\nThese techniques were used to test for any significant differences between time-related\nconditions, namely: shift, week, day of the week, hour of day, hour in shift. In this\nseries of analyses, no significant results were found for any of the time-related\nconditions, signifying that temporal factors have little or no effect on workers\u2019\nproduction task performance overall. The results are, therefore, not reported herein.\n4.1.2 Real Time Ranges\nThe \u2018real\u2019 times recorded for each workstation were compared with the \u2018standard times\u2019\nused in the design of this assembly line. Standard times are based on the principle that\n100% represents normal (average) worker performance, and that normal worker\nperformance variability ranges between 120% & 80% of this average time.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the real times for the first and last workstations monitored (as\nthese are proximally least likely to be subject to effects from the same system\nconditions); reference lines illustrate the standard times and ranges. It can be seen that\nthe production tasks are generally being performed faster than the expected rate, a\nfeature that was common across nine of the workstations. Moreover, in six out of the ten\nworkstations monitored the work rate tendency is faster than the 120% level. This\nindicates that most of the monitored production tasks were performed faster than the\nminimum expected time by system designers using standardised times.\n9Figure 2.

In order to allow for possible effects of different task demands\/\ncharacteristics the data was standardised. A one way between-groups ANOVA was then\nperformed on the standardised dataset to assess the magnitude of differences between\nthe means of the grouped scores which represented individual workers\u2019 performance\ntimes. The results showed a significant difference between scores\n[F(129,214062)=907.34, p<.0001] and this was supported by a \u2018large\u2019 calculated eta\nsquared effect size (\u03b7=.35)2.\nThe significant differences that were found were determined to be the result of task\ncharacteristics more than human differences. Figure 4 shows a histogram of the\nstandardised grouped score means for each individual worker and according to divisions\nper workstation. Clearly, there is a convergence of similar performance times according\nto the workstation indicating that the significant disparities are attributable to the nature\nof the production task.\nFigure 4.

The implication of this reliability is not only that the scales were\nappropriate for this sample but also that this sample could be relied upon for providing\nsincere responses. The attitude survey responses were then analysed to investigate:\nComparison to Normative Data (how responses from this sample compare to the\n\u2018benchmark\u2019 data for this type of workforce supplied by the attitude scales\u2019 developers)\nIntercorrelations (within-sample relationships between attitudes and demographics)\nQualitative Data (results of the additional questions asked during the interview surveys)\nThese different analyses are now described in turn.\n4.2.1 Comparison to Normative Data\nAll sample scores show some variation from the UK norm and standard deviations (SD)\ndata (Table 1). However, it is noteworthy that ALL of the sample SD data are smaller\nthan normative SD, signifying a particularly homogeneous and cohesive workforce.\nUK\nnorm UK SD\nSample\nmean\nSample\nSD\nWork Involvement (WI) 32.83 5.94 31.68 5.451\nOrganisational Commitment (OC) 45.37 9.56 47.98 8.027\nIntrinsic Job Motivation (IJM) 36.25 5.51 35.46 4.959\nInterpersonal Trust in Team Members (ITtm) 34.51 6.60 38.86 3.746\nInterpersonal Trust in Management (ITm) 28.53 8.24 30.23 7.584\nInterpersonal Trust at Work total (IT) 63.04 10.23 69.08 8.755\nPerceived Intrinsic Job Characteristics (PIJC) 32.74 8.39 30.21 6.825\nExtrinsic Job Satisfaction (JSe) 37.99 8.36 42.49 5.751\nIntrinsic Job Satisfaction (JSi) 32.61 8.25 32.85 6.006\nJob Satisfaction total (JS) 70.53 15.42 75.33 10.358\nTable 1. Comparison of Sample and Normative Attitude Data: Evidence of a Cohesive\nand Homogeneous Workforce\n4.2.2 Intercorrelations\nA correlation matrix was generated to investigate the magnitude of differences in\nworker attitudes and biographic data; this presented various intercorrelations. These\ndemonstrated that Age and Length of Employment (LE) showed similar associations:\nsmall positive relationships with Intrinsic Job Motivation (IJM) but moderate negative\nrelationships with Interpersonal Trust in Management (ITm) \/ Interpersonal Trust at\nWork (IT) and Extrinsic Job Satisfaction (JSe). Small negative associations were also\nfound between LE and Organisational Commitment (OC). LE results were mirrored by\n2A reliable scale should ideally achieve a Cronbach alpha coefficient of more than .7 but this is often\nmuch lower when scales consist of a small number of items (e.g. <10; Pallant, 2000).\n12\nthose for Employment Status (ES) indicating an understandable link between the two\nbiodata. Gender was found moderately related to OC with females reporting greater\ncommitment levels, although due to a huge disparity between samples in these two\ngroups this result is not robust.\nThe developers of these scales found intercorrelations between the attitude constructs\nand some relationships with age (Warr et al, 1979; Cook and Wall, 1980). To examine\nthe possible relationship between age and attitudes scores for each worker were\nanalysed using standard multiple regression. The results presented a poor fit of just 21%\nof the variance in age accounting for the measured attitudes (r2adj=.214). However, the\noverall relationship was significant [F(8,102)=4.74, p<001]. Only two attitudes were\nfound to make a significant contribution to the regression equation: ITm (beta=.449,\np<.001) and IJM (beta=-.235, p<.03).\nOverall, worker attitudes were particularly homogeneous with higher scores of IJM, JSe\nand Interpersonal Trust in team members (ITtm) than would be expected based on the\nnormative data. Significant differences between crews in OC, IJM, ITm, IT at Work,\nand Intrinsic Job Satisfaction (JSi) were judged to be related to age and length of\nservice. Attitudes did not differ significantly between the teams and were not\nsignificantly different between individuals apart from in respect of ITm and IJM.\n4.2.3 Qualitative Data\nThe questions added to the survey to elicit richer contextual information to explain why\ncertain attitudes may be held involved asking respondents to state which work-related\nfactors a) gave them the most satisfaction, b) gave them the most dissatisfaction and c)\nthey would most like to change (given opportunity and resources). Using simple content\nanalysis the issues cited in responses were grouped into broad themes. Responses\n(Figure 5) show worker satisfaction is reported to be related to two main factors,\nnamely, pay (37.8%) and fellow workers\/teams (21.6%), these are followed by the\nnature of the job itself (15.3%) and job security (11.7%).\nWorker dissatisfaction (Figure 6) was mainly attributed to factors concerning the shift\npattern and work hours at the plant (39.6%). Interestingly, the nature of the job itself\nwas the second most frequently cited factor causing dissatisfaction as it was cited for\nsatisfaction, and in a similar percentage of responses (16.2%).\n13\nFigure 5. Factors Associated With Satisfaction at Work\nFigure 6. Factors Associated With Dissatisfaction at Work\nThe most common factor that workers cited they would change (Figure 7) concerned\nissues regarding their work conditions (27.9%), followed by \u2018downtime\u2019 issues (19.8%),\nwhich concerned keeping the line functioning and avoiding disturbances and\nbreakdowns.\n5.4% 21.6%\n3.6%\n37.8%\n4.5%\n11.7%\n15.3%\nOther teams\/coworkers\nproduct\npay\nmeet targets\njob security\njob itself\n12.9%\n21.3%\n26.4%\n5.4%\n8.1%\n10.8%\n3.0%\n7.2%\n4.8%\nOther\nteams\/coworkers\npay\norganisation\njob security\njob itself\nextra duties\nconditions\nbenefits\n14\nFigure 7. Factors Workers Would Change If They Could\nThe additional qualitative information gathered during the attitude survey was\nsuccessful in providing a greater insight into contextual issues that may explain the\nproduction task performance cycle time variability results. Workers reported\nconsiderable interest in improving the smooth running of the assembly line and their\nproduction task cycles for two primary reasons. First, the monotony of the job was\nconsidered to be made easier by fast production task cycles; many workers stated that\nthey exert autonomy by pacing faster and slower when the line was running consistently\nto relieve the repetitiveness of their work. Interruptions to the line meant the workers\ncould only clean up their work area or spend time idle for which they would be\n\u201ccriticised\u201d by foremen. The workers expressed annoyance about machine breakdowns\nand poor provision of maintenance, repairs, and parts and stated an interest in having\ngreater control and particularly being more responsible for maintenance in their own\narea. Respondents reported that they were too often held accountable for productivity\nshortfalls for reasons which were beyond their control and which they felt were highly\npreventable. There were also many related comments complaining about a lack of\ncontrol over the delivery of parts for which they would prefer to have better access to.\nSecondly, many workers expressed a desire to achieve production targets. Again, the\nreasons were twofold. Some workers stated a more personal interest in respect of their\njob security, i.e. that they were in competition with other plants within their organisation\nso their jobs were safer if their production levels were higher. Alternatively, other\nworkers were more concerned about the extra pressures that they said were applied by\nforemen and line managers when production levels were low.\n12.6%\n.9%\n8.1%\n2.7%\n5.4%\n19.8%\n11.7%\n6.3%\n.9%\n27.9%\n3.6%\nshifts\/hours\nmanagement\njob itself\nholidays\nfacilities\ndowntime\ndoubleback\ndistances in plant\ncoworkers\nconditions\ncommunication\n15\n4.3 Overall Summary of Results\nTable 2 illustrates the main results of the analyses concerning performance and\nattitudes.

Additionally, the significant results\nof attitudinal differences found at the crew and individual level of analysis appeared to\nbe related to biographic data whereas performance differences appeared to be more\nrelated to workstations.\n5. Discussion and concluding remarks\nThis study set out to investigate the degree to which worker performance in modern\nmanufacturing systems varies beyond what is currently accounted for by system\ndesigners, and how such variations may be related to attitudes. The study measured\nworker performance and worker attitudes in a real working production system. As this\nresearch generated two separate bodies of data, for attitudes and production task\nperformance cycle times, the resulting datasets were not statistically relatable.\nConsequently, the findings of this study can only be logical interpretations of co-\nvariations between worker performance and attributes. Nonetheless, as we have found\nworker attitudes to be quite homogeneous but performance times significantly different\nit is reasonable to assume that attitudes are not a major influence on production task\nperformance variations.\nTaking the evidence as a whole, it seems more likely that\nfound in workers\u2019 production task performance\nrather than worker attitudes\nhistograms featured in Figures 1 and 2\ndue to the remote data collection method, i\ndue to the effects of task-related features that cause regular time delays\n- such as stock handling or maintenance procedures.\npeaks represent a human characteristic such as two common work\nthis is unlikely given that F\ndistinctly related to a particular workstation on the assembly line.

However, as accurate\ndesign evaluations are so important to system performance and organisational\ncompetitiveness, and evidence from this study shows that current evaluations seem to be\ninaccurately representing worker performance, further work in this area is warranted.\nA major implication of this research is that it has provided evidence that human\nperformance can be significantly variable - despite the constraints and regulations\nimposed by job simplification and mechanical functions in modern manufacturing\nsystems. Related to this, the mode of production task cycle times greatly exceeds the\nstandardised performance parameters that are customarily used by system designers for\ndesign evaluations and line balancing. Together, these findings support that the\naccuracy of design evaluations is indeed likely to be affected by a deficient\nrepresentation of human variability. The evidence certainly raises questions about the\nefficacy of current time study techniques, line balancing, and assumptions of job\nsimplification\/regulation.\nReferences\nArgyle, M. (1992).
