In the past this has been difficult to model, as locality appears to be cache\nspecific.  We show that locality can be characterised with a single parameter, which\nprimarily varies with the topological position of the cache, and is largely independent of\nthe culture of the cache users.  The accurate determination of the parameter requires large\nsamples.  This is due to a large timescale, long range dependency in the user requests.\n1.  Introduction.\nWWW caching has proved a valuable technique for scaling up the internet [ABR95, BAE\n97].  Caches can bring files nearer the client (with a possible reduction in latency), reduce\nload on servers and add missing robustness to a distributed system such as the web. A\ncache\u2019s usefulness is directly related to the degree of locality shown in the files it serves,\nwhere locality refers to the tendency of users to request access to the same files.  The\nlocality is best illustrated using a popularity curve, which plots the number of requests for\neach file against the file\u2019s popularity ranking.  It is often said that this popularity curve\nfollows Zipf's law, Popularity = K* ranking-a, with a being close to 1 (e.g. [CUN95]);\nothers argue that the curve does not follow Zipf's law [ALM98].  Zipf's law has been\nobserved in several environments where human choice is involved, including linguistic\nword selection [ZIP49] and choice of habitat [MAR98b], so there is an expectation that\nsome measures of file popularity should follow Zipf\u2019s law too.  This would be useful\nbecause previous observations of Zipf\u2019s law have been largely culture independent, and if\nsome culture independent cache metrics could be established cache models would not\nneed to take account of cultural effects.  However, it is not at all clear that cache logs\nreflect human choices, since not all of a user\u2019s web requests reach the network cache.\nSome of the user\u2019s requests are intercepted on the user\u2019s client, by the cache maintained\nby the browser.  In addition it is hard to establish whether logged requests are user\ninitiated or are the result of embedded object links.  The 'Zipf \/ not Zipf' argument is not\nhelped by the notion that a curve follows Zipf's law if the exponent is close to unity, with\nthe precise meaning of 'close' being vague.  In fact (e.g. fig. 1) the observed popularity\ncurves vary significantly. In order to use the observations in a predictive model, it is\nnecessary to link the variations to features of the caches.  That is, we must attempt to\nexplain the differences in terms of measurable parameters.  In this paper we present a set\nof possible explanations of the variance, derived from the literature and our own\nimagination, and propose tests of the explanations.  We have performed some of the tests\nby analysing a wide variety of caches, and have thereby eliminated some of the theories.\nWe argue (along with another recent, submitted study [BRE98]) that popularity curves\nare more accurately modelled by a power law curve with a fitted, negative exponent that\nis not usually -1.  We show in this paper, and elsewhere [ROA98], that even for this\nmodel to be meaningful, the definitions of what is to be plotted, the sample size, and the\nfit must be made carefully and precisely.  We demonstrate for the first time in this paper\nthat, with appropriate care in the analysis, it can be shown that whilst the power law\ncurves are not strictly Zipf curves they are still culture independent.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nPopularity ranking (1=Most Popular)\nZipf's Law\nACT (Aus)\nSwinburne (Aus)\nEdinburgh\nHGMP\nKorea\nLe Trobe\nFigure 1.  Scaled popularity curves at 6 caches.\n2. Theories.\nOne possible hypothesis (derived from a related proposal by Zipf [ZIP49]) is that caches\nat different levels of the hierarchy have different exponents for best-fit power laws, and\ncaches higher up the hierarchy would have smaller exponents. This is due to a filtering\neffect of intervening caches.  Requests to NLANR, for example, might first go through a\nbrowser, local, regional and\/or national caches, each one serving some of the requests.\nUnless there is a strong correlation between the time to live (ttl) allocated to a file and the\nfile\u2019s popularity, this 'filtering' will be systematic.  This is because requests for more\npopular files are reduced more than requests for less popular files, since only the first\nrequest for a file from a low level cache reaches a high level cache.  If the filtering is\nsystematic there should be a reduction in the exponent observed (illustrated in figure 2).\nFigure 2 also shows that there would be no change in power law exponent if the filtering\nwas in a 'per request' manner (which would be obtained if ttl was inversely proportional\nto popularity).  Seeking a negative correlation between the hierarchical position of\ncaches, and the fitted exponent can test this hypothesis.\ny = 100x -1\ny = 80x -1\ny = 82.607x -0.9103\n10\n100\n1 10\nRanking\n\u2026\u2026.  Original Requests\n______   Stochastic filtering\n_ _ _  Popularity\ndependent filtering.\nFigure 2.  The possible effects of cache filtering\nWhile filtering is one possible factor affecting the exponent of the locality curve, other\nfactors possibly influence the exponent. Possible reasons for differences in power law\nexponent include:\na. Size of the cache.  It has been proposed [BRE98b] that larger caches (i.e. Caches\nwith more requests per day) should have smaller exponents.  This can be tested by\naccurately determining the exponent for a range of caches, at the same position in the\nhierarchy, and finding a correlation between exponent and size.  Taking progressively\nlarger samples from a single cache is not a good test since, as we show below,\npopularity data is highly bursty and small samples of less than 500000 requests\nprovide unreliable results\nb. The nature of client.  Clients that have large caches will filter requests more than\nclients with small caches.  As the size of the client cache depends on the available\ndisk space, and the disk space is roughly inversely proportional to the age of the\ncomputer, areas tending to have newer computers may have lower exponents.  So a\ncache serving an industrial lab should have a lower exponent than a cache serving\npublicly funded schools.\nc. Number of days that the data is collected over.  It is possible that the popularity\ncurve only approaches stability assymptotically.  If the behaviour of individuals is\nstrongly correlated (e.g. by information waves) on a range of timescales with an\ninfinite variance, then the popularity curve exponent will exhibit variation regardless\nof sample size or timescale.  On the other hand if the correlation is only at bounded\ntimescales the exponent will be stable only at timescales larger than the bound.  If the\nbehaviour of individual users is only weakly correlated, but has a bounded\nautocorrelation (e.g. fractional Gaussian statistics), then the exponent should be stable\nat large sample size regardless of timescale.\nd. Cultural differences between user communities.   Popularity curves are a reflection\nin user behavior, so differences in this behavior should be reflected in the data\n[ALM98].  From consideration of the work of Zipf on word use in different cultures,\nit seems likely that cultural differences will often be expressed through differences in\nthe K factor in the power curve rather than the exponent.  If the exponent is\nsignificantly affected by cultural factors then the variation should not be explicable by\nany obvious cache metrics.  This can be tested by using caches which are similar in\nsize and topological position, and demonstrating inexplicable variation in the\nexponent of the popularity curve\n3. Techniques.\nTo analyse file popularity, cache logs are usually needed, the only alternative being the\ncorrectly processed output from such a cache log.  We are indebted to several sources for\nmaking their logs available, and hope this is fully shown in the acknowledgements.  We\nhave analysed cache logs from several sources including:\nNLANR-lj, a high-level cache serving other caches worldwide\nRMPLC, a cache serving schools in the UK\nFIN, a cache serving Finnish Universities and academic institutions\nSPAIN, a cache serving most of the universities and polytechnics of Spain\nPISA, a cache serving the computer science department of Pisa University, Italy\nProcessed statistics are also available via web pages.  We have used published logs from:\nHGMP (Human Genome Mapping Project) used by scientists working on the HGMP\nproject in the U.K.\nACT, Swinburne, Letrobe,  Caches serving academic communities in Australia\nThe range of logs we have looked contain different proportions of academic and home\nusage.  This is of importance because one possible reason for the variation between\ncaches could be the various usage styles at the caches.\nCache logs can be extremely comprehensive, detailing time of request, bytes transferred,\nfile name and other useful metrics [e.g. ftp:\/\/ircache.nlanr.net\/Traces\/].  It is inevitable\nthough, that they cannot contain every variable, that every researcher requires.  At the\nmoment cache logs do not contain the means to discriminate between the physical request\nmade by the client and files that are requested by linkage (linked image file, redirections\netc) to the requested files.  Some heuristic proposals have been made for filtering out\nlinked requests (e.g. only looking at HTML files [HUB98], filtering out file requests with\nvery close time dependencies [MAR98a]), but these inevitably introduce some error into\nthe analysis.  Another analysis irregularity is that some researchers look at the popularity\nof generic hosts and not files.  We believe that the best approach is to accept that some\npages have embedded links and analyse all requests going through a cache, unlinked or\notherwise.  The popularity curves in this paper were generated using all the logged\nrequests for files in the analysis period.\nA simple, least squares method [TOP72] was used to fit power law curves to the data.\nThe quality of the fit was checked using the standard R2 test.  The least squares algorithm\ndid not initially fit the upper (most popular) part of the curve very well. The R2 was\nbetween 0.7 and 0.9 and the visual fit was poor (figure 3).  In an effort to rectify this, a fit\non modified data was used [ZIP49].  This involved taking all the files that were requested\nan identical number of times and averaging their ranking, in effect giving them all the\nsame ranking (which seems fairer).  For example, if three files are requested 10 times\neach and are ranked 100, 101 and 102, then one point would appear on the graph at\nranking = 101, popularity = 10.  As can be seen in figure 3 this makes for a much tighter\nvisual fit.  The improvement is confirmed by much higher R2 values (table 1).  The least\nsquares calculation could use a weighting for these averaged points, in proportion to the\nnumber of files they represent, but with good R2 values this seemed unnecessary.\ny = 53.315x-0.511\nR2 = 0.8302\ny = 106.91x-0.5872\nR2 = 0.9898\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nRanking\nN\no \nof\n R\neq\nue\nst\ns\nAll Points\nAverage Points\nPower (All Points)\nPower (Average Points)\nFigure 3.  Illustration of fit calculated by least squares algorithms\n4.  Variability of Locality.\nIn order to compare data from different caches reliably it is necessary to ensure that\ndifferences are real and not due to insufficiently large samples.  In order to establish the\nvariability of the fitted exponent we examined the popularity curve of one cache over a\nlong period of time.  The cache we chose was the Human Genome Research Project\n(HGMP) cache in the U.K [http:\/\/wwwcache.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk\/].  This cache receives\nabout 10000 requests per day from a research community.  They publish an access count\nhistogram that gives the number of objects accessed N times, this can be easily converted\nin to a ranking vs. popularity graph.  The least squares procedure can then be used to find\nthe slope of the line with best fit.  This was carried out for six months of data from\nJanuary 1998 to July 1998, inclusive.  Over these six months the fitted exponent ranged\nfrom -0.23 to -1.34 with a mean of -0.5958 and a variance of 0.03 (figure 4), using the\n'averaged' ranking method mentioned above.\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0 Date\nFigure 4.  Variation of best-fit exponent over time\nFigure 4 shows the large amount of variation from the mean.  If the data shows long-\nrange dependence the sample size required to get a reliable estimate of the slope of the\npopularity curve will be considerably larger than might be expected for normal Poisson\nstatistics.  A simple aggregated variance graph [TAQ95] was plotted using the data in\nfigure 4, to test for long range dependency (fig 5).\ny = 0.0334x-0.6322\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1 10 100\nX Days\nHurst Parameter =0.68\nFigure 5.  Aggregate variance of fitted exponents over time.\nThe Hurst parameter was calculated using the formula Slope = 2H - 2\nThe H of 0.68 indicates that there is some self-similarity in 'best fit' exponents over time,\nthis implies that large sample sizes will be required.  It is worth noting that the self-\nsimilarity revealed in figure 5 is over 3 orders of magnitude of timescale from hours to\nweeks.  It is thus quite different from the long-range dependency reported elsewhere\n[PIT98] at timescales of up to a few minutes which is attributable to memory effects in\nnetwork buffers.  It is clear evidence for a second long-range dependency at the timescale\nof human memory, which system designers will also need to take into account.\nIn figure 6 we show the effect of increasing the number of requests used to calculate the\nexponent, at three of the caches we have used.  The exponent converges to a stable value\nfor samples of 300 000 or more requests, for all the caches we have analysed.  Error\nestimates are shown at two request ranges, pointing to a need for over 300 000 requests.\nWe have accordingly used samples of 500 000 requests in the analysis reported in the\nnext section.  Interestingly the convergence of the exponent does not appear to depend on\ntime \u2013 the time taken to collect 500 000 requests varied from 1 day to 1 week.  This\nmeans that the number of days taken to collect the sample does not significantly affect\nthe slope of the popularity curve.  It is worth noting that the apparent dependence of the\nvalue of the exponent at small sample size is not real. The trend is simply due to the fact\nthat the exponent has a heavy tailed distribution with most periods giving low exponents\nand some periods giving very high exponents (as shown in figure 4), thus the most likely\nresult of picking a random sample is to underestimate the exponent.  This effect simply\ndiminishes as the sample size increases.\n-0.75\n-0.7\n-0.65\n-0.6\n-0.55\n-0.5\n-0.45\n-0.4\n0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000 600000\nNumber of requests used to calculate exponent\nNLANR - lj\nSPAIN\nFUNET\nFigure 6.

Least square fits for 3 large caches.\nFigures 7 & 8 clearly show that even when a suitably large number of requests is used\nvery different best-fit curves are generated for each cache.  The NLANR cache is used as\na parent by some national caches.  FUNET and Spain are national caches, RMPLC and\nPISA are local caches serving very different communities.  The best-fit exponents in table\n1 follow this order, so our results are a strong indication that the variation is at least partly\ndue to hierarchy filtering as proposed in section 2.\nError estimates were calculated using several methods, the ones shown were the largest\ncalculated.  These were derived by sampling the points on the curve, fitting least squares\ncurves and then looking at the variances of the exponents fitted to the subsets of points to\nderive standard errors.\nCache Position Exponent R squared Error estimate\nNLANR - lj Highest -0.644 0.9897 \u00b10.024\nPISA Local -0.913 0.9807 \u00b10.038\nFUNET National -0.699 0.9883 \u00b10.046\nSPAIN National -0.724 0.9817 \u00b10.045\nRMPLC Local -0.858 0.9795 \u00b10.109\nTable 1.   Cache factors of interest.\nAs a second approach, it is possible to look at daily locality curves and their fitted\nexponents if these exponents are averaged over a long enough period (see section 4).\nThis approach was carried out on 4 caches, with results following those of the previous\nsection (table 2).  This result is useful since some caches do not publish individual file\nrequests, but do publish daily popularity curves.  An example is the HGMP cache, which\nis shown in the table although the result shown is for too small a sample to be\nmeaningful.\nRequest Based Analysis Averages of Daily Analysis\nNLANR - lj -0.644 -0.6211\nPISA -0.913\nFUNET -0.699 -0.701\nSPAIN -0.724\nRMPLC -0.858 -0.824\nHGMP -0.596\nTable 2.

Discussion.\nThe data in section 5 supported the notion that the variation in cache popularity curves is\nsimply due to the hierarchical position of the cache.  Our data shows no evidence\nsupporting any other of the possibilities we considered in section 2.  We showed in\nsection 3 that the variation was not a temporal effect, and that size was probably not\nsignificant.  As it is commonly supposed that size is a major factor it is worth presenting\nfuther support for our contention that it is not here.  Figure 9 shows cache size plotted\nagainst exponent.  We cannot fit a line to this data with a meaningful degree of\nconfidence, but any line would show no relationship between size (requests\/day) and\nexponent.\n-1\n-0.9\n-0.8\n-0.7\n-0.6\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000\nSize (requests\/day)\nFigure 9.  Relationship between requests\/day and exponent.\nAs for culture dependence, consider the low level caches RMPLC and PISA.  RMPLC\nserves UK secondary schools and has a user community which is very different from a\n\u2018normal\u2019 web user community.  The users are severely constrained, strongly guided by\nteachers and syllabi and very young.  It is hard to imagine a user community more\ndifferent from the undergraduates, lecturers and researchers at Pisa university.  Yet both\nsites show similar exponents.  There is thus no evidence in our data for cultural\ndependency in the value of the exponent.  Of course this does not mean that other cache\nmetrics will not show culture dependencies.\nThe lack of significant differences between caches at similar apparent levels in the\nhierarchy means that client effect are not significant either.  However, we believe that\nincreased cache capability at clients may be one reason why old cache logs tend to have\nhigher exponents than current logs.  This supposition deserves further analysis.\nThe discovery of a relatively straightforward cache metric is proving very beneficial in a\ncache model we have built which will be reported in a subsequent paper. The model is\ncurrently being further developed at BT, along with other simulation programs (e.g.\nBAR98) that evaluate cache performance by generating a representative stream of\nrequests.  These models require an accurate description of real cache behavior so their\nperformance can be accurately assessed.  Any viable simulator must express the same\nbehavior that has been demonstrated in this paper.\n7. Conclusion.\nThe analysis of cache popularity curves requires careful definition of what is to be\nanalysed and, since the data displays significant long range dependency, very large\nsample sizes.  With appropriate care it is possible to fit an inverse power law curve to\ncache popularity curves, with an exponent of between -0.9 and -0.5, and with a high\ndegree of confidence.  The exponent does not appear to depend on cache size, on time, or\non the culture of the cache users, but only depends on the topological position of the\ncache in the network.  It is thus a useful metric for modelling purposes.  Further data\nshould be analysed to fully confirm the relative independence of the metric.\nAcknowledgements.\nWe would like to thank Pekka J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen for supplying us with anonymised logs for the\nFunet proxy cache, Simon Rainey (RMPLC), Javier Puche (Centro Superior de\nInvestigaciones Cientificas) and Luigi Rizzo (Pisa).
