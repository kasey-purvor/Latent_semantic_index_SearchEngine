Questionnaires are usually paper based or delivered online and consist of a set of questions which all participants are asked to complete.

They require a large amount of the investigator\u2019s time during the interviews and also for transcribing and coding the data. Focus groups usually consist of one investigator and a number of participants in any one session.
