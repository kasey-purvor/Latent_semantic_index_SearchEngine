The company has worked\nclosely with the academic sector for many years to\nprovide technology innovations which it has then\nsought to take forward into its practical, integrated\nsystem products.The FLAVIIR (flapless air vehicle inte-\ngrated industrial research) research programme repre-\nsents an innovative approach to industrial\u2013academic\nresearch collaboration [1]. There are several aspects to\nthe innovative approach. First, a strategic agreement\nwas established between BAESystems, the major inter-\nnational aerospace company, and the UK\u2019s Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)\nin which the two organizations agreed to jointly\nfund a major research programme in Aeronautical\nEngineering. This partnership is intended to stimulate\nacademic research that is better suited to the needs of\nindustry. In particular, the objective of the programme\nis to develop a research capability in UK academia\nthat is more industrially focused and relevant than has\nbeen the case traditionally. This strategic partnership\nfunds research through a collaborative engagement\nwith several chosen academic network partners across\nthe UK, led by Cranfield University as the chosen\n\u2018Strategic Capability Partner\u2019. These relationships are\nillustrated in Fig. 1.\nA total of 14 research groups at ten UK universities\nare involved in the programme, which has a total value\nof \u00a36.5 M. The 5-year programme started in 2004 and\nruns until December 2009.\nThis innovative joint approach to funding research\nin academia drives increased collaboration between\nthe academic institutions and an emphasis on achiev-\ning an integrated outcome of practical relevance for\nJAERO580 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n356 P John\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of the BAESystems \u2013\nEPSRC \u2013 university partnerships\nindustrial exploitation. Hence the innovation of the\nresearch programme can be summarized by the key\nwords of \u2018Collaboration\u2019, representative \u2018Integration\u2019,\nand \u2018Exploitation\u2019. The Strategic Capability Partner-\nship in Aeronautical Engineering, with the associated\nFLAVIIR research programme, was the first such rela-\ntionship to be launched by BAESystems. Similar strate-\ngic relationships and research programmes have since\nbeen launched in other disciplines. These include\nSystems Engineering, with the NECTISE research\nprogramme (Network Enabled Capability Through\nInnovative Systems Engineering) [2] and Informa-\ntion Systems, with the ALADDIN research programme\n(Autonomous Learning Agents for Decentralised Data\nand Information Networks) [3].\n2 TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS\nThe increased emphasis on industrial relevance and\nexploitation of novel technologies can be expressed\nin terms of \u2018Technology Relevance Levels\u2019 (TRLs), the\naim being to take academic research to higher TRLs\nthan is usually the case. TRLs are usually described\nthrough a scale of nine levels as follows.\n1. TRL9: Actual technology\/system qualified through\nsuccessful mission operations.\n2. TRL8: Actual technology\/system completed and\nqualified through test and demonstration.\n3. TRL7 : Technology\/system prototype demonstra-\ntion in an operational environment.\n4. TRL6: Technology\/system\/subsystem model or\nprototype demonstration in a relevant environ-\nment.\n5. TRL5: Technology component and\/or basic tech-\nnology subsystem validation in relevant environ-\nment.\n6. TRL4: Technology component and\/or basic tech-\nnology subsystem validation in laboratory environ-\nment.\n7. TRL3: Analytical and experimental critical function\nand\/or characteristic proof-of-concept.\n8. TRL2: Technology concept and\/or application for-\nmulated.\n9. TRL1: Basic principles observed and reported.\nBroadly speaking, academic research is often foc-\nused on fundamentals of technologies and proof of\nconcept, as indicated by TRLs 1 to 3. On the other\nhand, industry, in developing system products that\nare practicable, proven and certified for use in the\nreal world, must operate through TRLs 7 and 8 up to\nTRL 9. Usually it falls to industry to bridge this gap\nthrough TRLs 4 to 6, which is sometimes dramati-\ncally called the TRL \u2018Valley of Death\u2019 in view of the\nmany technologies that fail to reach their potential\nthrough successful exploitation in industrial products\nand processes. In FLAVIIR, the aim is for academia to\nmove into undertaking these higher levels of research\nand so provide a capability to industry that is of more\nrelevance to exploitation in their products. One impor-\ntant feature of the TRLs defined above is that higher\nTRLs relate to technologies being used in increas-\ningly representative contexts and environments. This\nincludes increasing the level of integration of tech-\nnologies with others associated with their overall\nreal world operation in products. Hence this aim of\nFLAVIIR requires that research into individual tech-\nnologies, conducted by individual university research\nteams, is extended to multidisciplinary teamwork-\ning on integrated technology concepts, designs, and\ndemonstrators. Only through such collaboration can\nthe practical implications, design trade-offs, and over-\nall system behaviour associated with higher TRLs be\ninvestigated and demonstrated. This means that the\nuniversities are engaged in systems integration as\nwell as in the technology research and so develop\nskills and knowledge that are usually restricted to\nindustry.\n3 GRANDCHALLENGES ANDRESEARCHTHEMES\nIn order to stimulate the above research approach,\ntwo \u2018Grand Challenges\u2019 were set for the FLAVIIR pro-\ngramme:\n(a) \u2018a maintenance-free UAV without conventional\ncontrol surfaces and no cost or performance\npenalties\u2019;\n(b) \u2018significant research impact through effective aca-\ndemic\/industry management and exploitation of\nlarge-scale, integrated academic research\u2019.\nThe first of these sets out the technical challenge to\nbe tackled within the field of Aeronautical Engineer-\ning: to research the achievement of an uninhabited\nair vehicle with novel control surface technologies\nand with performance and cost comparable or bet-\nter than conventional technologies. This results from\na drive to reduce the acquisition and operation costs\nof UAVs while retaining capability. The advantages of\nunmanned systems must be demonstrated in terms of\nperformance (\u2018effectiveness\u2019 is often used as a measure\nfor military aircraft) but it should also be recognized\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO580\nThe FLAVIIR programme in aeronautical engineering 357\nthat this effectiveness is quickly eroded if the costs\nof acquisition or operation are too high. As an exam-\nple, it has been reported in the past that at one\nstage the rate of loss of the Predator UAV was 32 per\n100 000 flying hours and this was an order of mag-\nnitude higher than the more capable F-16 [4]. Such\nexpensive losses diminish the cost effectiveness of the\nunmanned system and make it less attractive to the\nend customer.\nThe second sets out the aspiration of establishing\na new research relationship between industry and\nacademia and across academia focused on higher\nTRLs and exploitation of the research.\nEarly in the FLAVIIR programme, key areas of\nresearch associated with the first of the Grand Chall-\nenges mentioned above were identified and selected.\nThese areas encompassed technologies that would\nsupport the achievement of low cost, flapless un-\nmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and were expressed as\nthe following Research Themes.\n1. Aerodynamics, with research groups at Cranfield\nUniversity, Imperial College of Science, Technology\n& Medicine, and the University of Manchester.\n2. Control systems, with research groups at the Uni-\nversity of Leicester, Imperial College of Science,\nTechnology & Medicine, and Cranfield University.\n3. Electromagnetics, with research groups at the Uni-\nversity of Nottingham, the University of Wales\n(Swansea), and the University of York.\n4. Manufacturing, with research groups at Warwick\nUniversity, the University of Liverpool, and Cran-\nfield University.\n5. Materials and structures, with a research group at\nImperial College of Science, Technology & Med-\nicine.\n6. Numerical simulation, with a research group at\nSouthampton University.\nIn addition, to meet the second Grand Challenge,\nthe design, manufacture, integration, and flight of a\ndemonstrator uninhabited air vehicle will provide the\nresearch teams with an integrated platform on which\nto evaluate the performance of their technology in a\nrealistic flight environment. This is encapsulated in a\nresearch theme of:\n1. Integration and demonstration, with multi-univer-\nsity collaboration led by a research group at Cran-\nfield University.\nThe inclusion of this technology demonstrator in the\nprogramme is an important feature. A report from the\nAerospace Innovation and Growth Team (AeIGT) on\nthe future of the UK aerospace industry [5] highlighted\nthe historical success of demonstrator programmes\nwithin the aerospace sector and recommended their\nadoption to improve the UK\u2019s competitive situation\nfor the future.\n4 RESEARCH SUMMARY\nIn this Special Edition of this journal several papers\nare presented that describe some of the research that\nhas been conducted on the FLAVIIR programme in\nsome of the Research Themes mentioned above. The\nfollowing sections provide an overview of the research\nconducted on the FLAVIIR programme by summariz-\ning the principal focus of the research conducted in\neach of the themes.\n4.1 Aerodynamics\nThe main focus of the aerodynamics research is on\nnovel means of flow control for improved manoeuvra-\nbility, design robustness, and simplicity. Technologies\nare being investigated that will replace conventional\ncontrol flaps with fluidic devices that achieve aerody-\nnamic control without the need for moving surfaces.\nManchester and Cranfield are investigating roll control\nusing wing-mounted fluidic devices that use pressur-\nized air from slots that extend along the trailing edge\nof a UAV wing. The basic principle is that blown air\nentrains the upper surface flow over the wing, thus\ngiving rise to an increase in lift. The trailing edge has\nto be modified to become rounded, but in general\nthe thickness of a typical trailing edge does not have\nto be altered. Manchester are also investigating pitch\ncontrol using vectoring of the principal thrust from\nthe main gas turbine engine of a UAV. The thrust-\nvector control device is mounted around the jet from\na gas turbine engine with upper and lower slots that\nproduce secondary Coanda pressurized jets that are\ncontrolled to cause deflection of the primary engine\njet. The principle is that deflection of the main jet\ncan be achieved by switching on a higher pressure\nsecondary wall jet that adheres to the geometry and\ndeflects the main jet with it.\n4.2 Control systems\nThe Control System research is providing technolo-\ngies that will support increased levels of autonomy,\nprovide the ability to reconfigure to react to a chang-\ning environment, and aid integration into a dis-\ntributed control network. Advances investigated in\nthis area include coordinated control, integrated con-\ntrol (multi-platforms) and condition monitoring; non-\nlinear and adaptive control, distributed aerodynamic\ncontrol.\nLeicester have focused on coordinated, integrated,\nand distributed control. Imperial College have studied\nadaptive and non-linear control strategies for systems.\nThis will be focused on devising new generic adaptive\nand non-linear control algorithms suited to aerospace\napplications and the provision of robust but non-\nconservative implementations of these algorithms.\nJAERO580 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n358 P John\nThe end goal is improved performance and reliability\nfor the control software.\n4.3 Electromagnetics\nThe thrust of the electromagnetic theme is to be\nable to predict and find novel ways of reducing\nsusceptibility of composite material structures to\nradio frequency (RF) threats and lightning strike. A\nsingle predictive code has been produced collabora-\ntively by three Universities (Swansea, Nottingham, and\nYork). Swansea have applied novel numerical analysis\ntechniques utilizing fast hybrid mesh methods. Not-\ntingham have researched ways to model small-scale\nelectrical devices within a large-scale environment in\nan efficient manner. The aim is to be able to efficiently\nand accurately design resilient composite material\nstructures with small gaps, slots, cables, and wires.\nSuch a tool will allow more detail and novel ideas\nto be explored at the concept stage. The research at\nYork has concentrated on material models: how to\nmodel carbon fibre structures, honeycombs, etc. and\non determining the effects of manufacturing irregular-\nities on electromagnetic fields during pulsed RF threat\nand lightning strike.\n4.4 Manufacturing\nThe focus of the manufacturing research is on reduc-\ning cost, not only in production but also in reducing\nmaintenance and increasing reliability. Warwick have\nstudied areas such as low cost reconfigurable tooling;\nCranfield have studied novel manufacturing processes\nfor composite materials, such as dry fabric laminating,\ntrans-laminar reinforcement, single sided stitching\nand tufting. Liverpool have researched Direct-write\ntechnologies and methods, with functional elements\nbeing achieved on and within composite structures\nby laying down conductive tracks directly onto the\nmaterial using printing technologies, special inks, and\nlaser curing.\nIn addition, the Cranfield Manufacturing team has\nmanufactured the composite material airframe of the\nDEMON aircraft, which has been developed to be the\nFLAVIIR demonstration UAV.\n4.5 Materials and structures\nThe materials research has focused on developing\npredictive methods to model delamination in com-\nposite materials. An accurate numerical method has\nthe potential to provide substantial cost savings by a\nsimple reduction in the number of component tests\nthat currently have to be completed. Imperial College\nhave demonstrated the potential of a novel \u2018inter-\nface element\u2019 method that allows easy and accurate\nmodelling of such failure mechanisms.\n4.6 Numerical simulation\nThe numerical simulation work within FLAVIIR is\nconcerned with numerical design and optimiza-\ntion. Southampton have formulated a concept design\nframework that enables modelling of complexity and\ncost within a concept design. These geometry-based\ndesigns (using CAD descriptions) are coupled to vari-\nous optimization strategies to allow \u2018what-if\u2019 studies to\nbe undertaken. Cost modelling has been investigated\nnot only to obtain the cost of parts but also in obtain-\ning the cost of integration based on part complexity,\nfunction, and mission importance.\n4.7 Integration and demonstration\nIntegration and demonstration are crucial elements\nwithin the FLAVIIR research in order to achieve the\naim of increasing the \u2018TRL\u2019 achieved by academic\nresearch. Technologies and research from across the\nprogramme are brought together in a collaboration to\ndesign, build, integrate, and fly a representative unin-\nhabited air vehicle, called \u2018DEMON\u2019. This demands\nan integrated multidisciplinary design approach, with\ncomplex trade-offs and risks to be dealt with in order\nto incorporate the novel technologies from the pro-\ngramme into a practical, integrated aircraft that will\nbe flown to demonstrate the technologies in real\nworld action. Cranfield are leading the Integration and\nDemonstration research and this will provide invalu-\nable information on the performance of the novel\ntechnologies as well as exercising a multidisciplinary\nteamwork approach centred on system integration\nand proving.\n5 EXPERIENCES AND LESSONS LEARNT\nThe FLAVIIR programme is aiming to achieve inno-\nvation in a number of ways. The novel research\nencompasses a very wide range, from technologies\nfor flight control (hardware and software) to manu-\nfacturing processes, to methods to support improve-\nments in the design process, such as optimization\nand predictive techniques. Further, the programme\u2019s\nfocus on increasing Technology Readiness Levels,\nand the corresponding focus on the Integration and\nDemonstration of a representative Uninhabited Air\nVehicle demand that the university groups work\ntogether very closely in a multidisciplinary team deal-\ning with complex design trade-offs and the manu-\nfacturing, assembly, proving, and certification of the\nvehicle. In addition, the focus on industrial relevance\nand exploitation requires a very close collaboration\nbetween the academics and industry and also requires\nan appropriate focus within industry itself. Several key\nlessons have been learned through the experiences of\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO580\nThe FLAVIIR programme in aeronautical engineering 359\ndealing with these issues on the FLAVIIR programme\nand these are described below.\n5.1 University approaches and capabilities\nOne of the primary aims of FLAVIIR is to dev-\nelop industrially relevant multidisciplinary skills in\nacademia. The achievement of a real uninhabited air\nvehicle requires many technologies to be integrated\nin a practical design, with the university researchers\ninvolved needing to work together in a collaborative,\nmultidisciplinary team. This requires skills in under-\nstanding the wider context and application into which\ntheir individual technologies are being implemented\nand a focus on practical issues associated with their\nimplementation. These practical aspects include non-\nfunctional properties of the technologies, such as\nreliability, weight, and environmental characteristics\n(e.g. thermal properties and electromagnetic compat-\nibilities). The researchers also need to consider the\nfailure modes and limitations of their technologies so\nthat the effectiveness, balance, and robustness of the\noverall design can be assessed throughout the design\nprocess. The integration and demonstration activi-\nties on FLAVIIR are led by a team in the Aerospace\nEngineering department at Cranfield University and\nthe programme has demonstrated the importance of\nthe team having capabilities in multidisciplinary team\nleadership, overall system evaluation, design, assem-\nbly, integration, and test. The decision to develop a\nrepresentative flying technology demonstration air-\ncraft as the culmination of the FLAVIIR programme\nhas demanded that academics develop such capa-\nbilities in order to deal with the critical integration\nissues that arise at higher TRLs. Issues that have\nbeen crucial include the common problem of weight\ngrowth in the UAV design and control of its centre\nof gravity (C of G) position. These parameters have\nbeen recognized throughout the design process as\ncrucial issues, linked directly to flight feasibility and\nperformance and demanding close attention to the\ninterdependencies between aspects such as aerody-\nnamic performance and stability, structural integrity\nand design adaptability. The latter aspect of design\nadaptability is important in the FLAVIIR DEMON tech-\nnology demonstration aircraft because in order to\nmanage risk and to provide a rigorous evaluation of\nnovel technologies, the aircraft will be flown with\nnew technologies introduced progressively. Hence the\naircraft will first fly with conventional control mecha-\nnisms and novel mechanisms will be introduced once\nthe baseline characteristics of the aircraft and conven-\ntional technologies are established. This progressive\napproach requires a modular design in order to change\nthe technology configuration and make appropriate\nadjustments to the flight control system and the mass\ndistribution within the aircraft, using flexible ballast\nin order to manage the change in C of G position.\nWeight growth and C of G management proved to be\nsignificant challenges throughout the design process\nand demanded close collaboration between the tech-\nnology researchers, aerodynamicists and designers of\nthe flight control system, the aircraft structure and the\noverall system. Examples of other practical issues that\nhad to be tackled include failure mode analysis of the\nintegrated UAV design, design of the aircraft operat-\ning procedures for the demonstration flights, a safety\ncase analysis, and negotiation with regulatory author-\nities to achieve appropriate flight clearance. Approval\nof the appropriate authorities to fly the DEMON air-\ncraft is of course an essential consideration and raises\npotential challenges given the objective of making\nthe aircraft representative of real-world issues. The\nDEMON design team at Cranfield developed their\ncapabilities in this area and liaised directly with the\nCivil Aviation Authority to discuss flight clearance.\nHowever, since the objective is to fly the aircraft as a\ntechnology demonstrator, not as an operational vehi-\ncle in itself, it was decided to simplify the clearance\nissues by flying only on an approved range with seg-\nregated airspace and ground area and with the flight\nprofile contained within an agreed safety footprint\nwithin the range boundary, so interaction with pub-\nlic areas is avoided. This approach reduces the need\nfor full compliance with formal certification standards\nand enables a case to be made based on evaluations of\nthe aircraft integrity, its performance and mass char-\nacteristics, the safety features, such as a cut-down\nsystem, and its operating procedures at the range.\nThe Certification Specification for Very Light Aircraft\n(CS-VLA) has been used as guidance on the struc-\ntural design and integrity and the CAA\u2019s \u2018Unmanned\nAircraft System Operations in UK Airspace\u2019 (CAP 722)\nand \u2018Policy for Light UAVs\u2019 have been used as guidance\non flight operations and procedures for the DEMON\naircraft.\nAchieving the necessary approach across univer-\nsities has required special efforts to overcome chal-\nlenges and barriers. Traditional academic research\ntends to be focused within groups, with indepen-\ndent ownership of research outcomes. This is rein-\nforced by conventional academic measures, such as\npublications on individual research. Academia is not\nstructured to easily accommodate and encourage\nmultidisciplinary research, particularly across univer-\nsity organizational boundaries. In the early stages\nof the programme, once the research themes and\npriority technologies and processes had been iden-\ntified and agreed, the inevitable focus within each\nresearch group was on establishing the fundamen-\ntal research progress in their area of expertise and\nthis represented a familiar mode of operation for\nresearchers. At this stage, cross-programme awareness\nand communication was achieved primarily through\nthe formation of aTechnical Committee, chaired by the\nTechnical Director and with membership comprising\nJAERO580 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n360 P John\nthe research leaders from each university group and\ncorresponding lead representative from BAESystems\nfor each technical theme. This committee met sev-\neral times per year. In addition, an annual programme\nconference was held to enable researchers to present\ntheir research to each other and to invited industri-\nalists. These mechanisms were always recognized as\ninadequate to achieve the more integrated approach\nnecessary to achieve the overall FLAVIIR objectives\nand so, as the programme progressed and the individ-\nual research technologies were increasingly needing\nto be focused on the \u2018integration\u2019 and \u2018higher TRL\u2019\nobjective, a different approach was introduced. Stim-\nulated by the challenge of designing an integrated UAV\nto demonstrate the technologies working successfully\ntogether, weekly integration meetings were initiated\nat approximately the mid-point of the programme.\nThese meetings involved the researchers from the uni-\nversity groups associated with the technologies that\nwere to be integrated into the \u2018DEMON\u2019 UAV, and\nquickly exposed the practical issues, interdependen-\ncies, and design trade-offs that lie at the heart of\nincreasing the TRL. The meetings were held face-to-\nface for a period of approximately 12 months and\nthen, as the understanding of the integration issues\nmatured, the meetings were held over the internet\nusing Webex technology. FLAVIIR has succeeded in\nbuilding an integrated team approach around the\ntangible integration, demonstration, and TRL chal-\nlenges prompted by the development and flight of\nthe DEMON aircraft. Without such a stimulus then it\nwould have been much more difficult to encourage the\noverall system, higher TRL capabilities, and multidis-\nciplinary teamworking and it is very unlikely that the\nFLAVIIR objectives would have been achieved. As it\nstands, everyone involved in the DEMON UAV devel-\nopment has gained a great deal of experience in such\ncapabilities.\n5.1.1 Challenges faced in relation to university\ncapabilities\nTraditional academic research and the capabilities\nassociated with it do not focus on the practical issues\nthat arise at higher TRLs. Academia is not organized\nalong multidisciplinary lines.\n5.1.2 Key lessons learnt in relation to university\ncapabilities\nThe capabilities to tackle these issues can be devel-\noped within academia but a shared tangible out-\ncome that stimulates the representative, integrated\nissues is invaluable, if not essential in order to stim-\nulate the necessary multidisciplinary teamworking\nand practical outcome-driven focus. The DEMON\nUAV development not only provided the platform for\ndemonstrating higher TRLs but also the integrated\noutcome focus for developing the academic capabil-\nities. As in any development programme, frequent\nintegration meetings and shared decision making are\nessential and the academics involved in DEMON\ngained greatly by adopting such approaches.\n5.2 Achieving an enduring university capability\nThe long-term aim of the strategic partnership\nbetween BAESystem, the EPSRC, and the universities\ninvolved in FLAVIIR is to develop an enduring aca-\ndemic capability that is capable of engaging with\nindustry at higher levels of TRL. One important les-\nson learnt from FLAVIIR, which seems obvious in\nhindsight, is that the expertise and experience that is\ngained should be primarily vested in the permanent\nacademic staff and not predominantly in the postdoc-\ntoral research officers and doctoral students on the\nprogramme, who tend to move on more often in these\nearly stages of their career, thus compromising the sus-\ntainable capability. It is the academics who will form\nthe principal enduring resource in a given university,\nto retain and further develop the expertise and so be\nable to continue to deliver and improve the intended\nindustrially focused capability. However, the FLAVIIR\nprogramme has faced a significant difficulty in ensur-\ning that a strong multidisciplinary, integrated exper-\ntise is developed significantly in academic staff rather\nthan predominantly in postdoctoral research officers.\nThe challenge arises because the FLAVIIR programme\nstarted in 2004, before the current Full Economic Cost\n(FEC) rules were implemented by the EPSRC. There-\nfore, the FLAVIIR programme is funded through an\nEPSRC \u2018pre-FEC\u2019 grant, under whose financial terms\nacademic staff costs are not allowed to be charged.\nThis causes a significant difficulty because it pre-\nsumes that the research can be primarily conducted by\npostdoctoral research officers, with occasional super-\nvision from academics. This is not suitable for meeting\nthe FLAVIIR integration and demonstration challenge\nto achieve higher TRLs and develop a sustainable\nacademic capability. Consequently, a significant com-\nmitment has been required to ensure that academic\nstaff have a significant involvement in the day-to-day\nresearch approach and multidisciplinary capability\ndevelopment. A request to the EPSRC to relax this\naspect of the pre-FEC rules was declined, demanding\na considerable financial investment in particular by\nCranfield University as\u2018system integrator\u2019 for DEMON.\nIn addition to the experience gained by academics,\nthat gained by the research officers and PhD students\non FLAVIIR is also of course very valuable and several\nhave been recruited into BAESystems from FLAVIIR,\nthus achieving another benefit from the programme\nin terms of the development of capable recruits into\nindustry.\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO580\nThe FLAVIIR programme in aeronautical engineering 361\n5.2.1 Challenges faced in relation to an enduring\nacademic capability\nThe EPSRC grant for FLAVIIR was let under \u2018pre-FEC\u2019\nrules that do not allow academic staff costs to be\ncharged. However, the difficulty and novelty of the\nFLAVIIR integration challenge, and the objective to\nachieve a new, sustainable academic capability has\ndemanded significant involvement by academics, for\nthe reasons described above.\n5.2.2 Key lessons learnt in relation to an enduring\nacademic capability\nThe EPSRC pre-FEC rules were not really the ideal to\nachieve the FLAVIIR objectives because of the restric-\ntions on the recovery of academic staff costs. Full aca-\ndemic involvement is essential and would be allowed\nunder the EPSRC\u2019s current FEC rules. A significant\ninvestment by the DEMON UAV system integrator,\nCranfield University, has been required to address this\nproblem.\n5.3 Collaboration between industry and\nuniversities\nAn important objective of the FLAVIIR programme has\nbeen to achieve academic research that is relevant\nto the needs of industry and, in the first instance, to\nBAESystems as the principal funding provider. (Note,\nhowever, that the route for this industrial funding is\nvia the EPSRC and so research council grant Terms\nand Conditions apply, as in the \u2018pre-FEC\u2019 discussion in\nthe previous section.) As explained above, this is seen\nin the emphasis on increased TRLs, representative\ntechnology demonstration and integration. In order to\nachieve this, it is clear that academic researchers and\nindustrialists need to work closely together so that, on\nthe one hand, the needs of industry are understood by\nacademia and, on the other, that industry understands\nthe outcomes of the research, both potential and\nemerging, and consider how best to exploit it within\ntheir activities and products. Consequently, as the\nFLAVIIR programme has progressed, there has been\nincreasingly close collaboration between industry and\nthe various academic groups. This collaboration has\ntaken several forms.\n5.3.1 Programme collaboration\nAt an overall FLAVIIR programme level, a Project man-\nager from BAESystems is assigned to the programme\npart-time to work with the academic Technical Direc-\ntor and this has proved to be an essential link between\nacademia and industry, particularly as the research\nprogressed and the emphasis on exploitation grew, as\ndescribed below.\nIn addition, there has been industrial oversight\nof the FLAVIIR programme by a Strategic Capabil-\nity Partnership Steering Group, which is chaired by\na senior executive of BAESystems and which covers\nall aspects of the strategic partnership in Aeronauti-\ncal Engineering. Wider guidance for the programme\nis provided by an Independent Steering Group (ISG),\nchaired by a senior government or industrial executive\nand with members with vast experience and excellent\nreputation. The EPSRC is represented on the ISG. The\npurpose of the ISG is to provide a strategic level of\nguidance for the project on technical issues, and to\nprovide the normal checks and balances for publicly\nfunded research. The Head of University Partner-\nships for BAESystems sits on both of these steering\ngroups.\n5.3.2 Research collaboration\nThroughout the programme researchers in the various\nspecialist groups across the partner universities have\nworked in close collaboration with nominated tech-\nnical experts from corresponding areas within BAE-\nSystems, which are organized into \u2018Technical Focus\nGroups\u2019. This has enabled industrial advice and guid-\nance to add value to the research content and direction\nand has ensured that the company is well informed of\nthe emerging research and potential benefits. In this\nway the academic research on FLAVIIR can be harmo-\nnized with relevant research being conducted within\nthe company.\n5.3.3 Integration and assembly collaboration\nCollaboration has been particularly strong in the\ndevelopment and assembly of the DEMON UAV itself.\nA \u2018Demon Delivery Manager\u2019 from BAESystems was\nassigned to the project for a period to work closely with\nthe Integration team at Cranfield University on the\nintegrated design and procurement for DEMON and\nto act as the interface with supporting company capa-\nbilities such as manufacturing. For example, some of\nthe assembly of the aircraft itself has been conducted\nat the BAESystems Apprentice School. This has been\nof mutual benefit, providing the company\u2019s appren-\ntices with an exciting, real aircraft project on which\nto develop and practice their skills while providing a\ncost-effective solution to the FLAVIIR need to build\nthe DEMON aircraft.\n5.3.4 Demonstration collaboration\nThe culmination of much of the FLAVIIR research\nis in the demonstration flights of the DEMON UAV.\nThis representative UAV requires appropriate confi-\ndence in the design integrity, flight characteristics,\nand flight operations to enable the demonstration\nJAERO580 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n362 P John\nflights to be undertaken and to achieve the neces-\nsary level of formal flight clearance. The experience\nof BAESystems in real projects and, in particular, in\nprevious UAV projects has been invaluable in support-\ning these issues. For example, formal Design Reviews\nand Flight Readiness Reviews, chaired by experienced\ncompany engineers, have provided confidence in the\ndesign; flight experts from BAESystems with experi-\nence of previous UAV programmes have collaborated\non the assessment of flight characteristics, and advised\non the conduct of, and clearance for, demonstration\nflights. Also, BAESystems are providing the experi-\nenced pilot who will control the aircraft during its\nnon-autonomous flights.\n5.3.5 Exploitation collaboration\nAs the FLAVIIR research has progressed and matured,\nthe focus on Exploitation has increased and engage-\nment between researchers and projects within BAE-\nSystems has been identified, facilitated, and managed.\nThis has been enabled by the industrial focus on\nexploitation mentioned in the next section. In addi-\ntion, since many of the details associated with\nexploitation are commercially sensitive and may not\nbe made completely visible to all the academic res-\nearchers, the Project Manager mentioned above (see\nProgramme Collaboration) has undertaken a role to\nwork with the Exploitation manager (see below) across\nindustry and academia to identify and build appropri-\nate links and drive through research priorities.\n5.3.5.1 Challenges faced in relation to industry\u2013\nuniversity collaboration: One of the principal objec-\ntives set out for FLAVIIR was to achieve significant\nresearch impact through effective academic\/industry\nmanagement and exploitation of large-scale, inte-\ngrated academic research. In short, this means forging\na new relationship between industry and academia\nin research, its relevance and exploitation. This has\nproved challenging because the previous relationships\nbetween industry and academia have been established\naround more traditional and focused research topics\nwithin technical disciplines and have had research\noutcomes at relatively low TRLs, with the effort to\ntake the basic research and develop it into practi-\ncal products resting with industry. There were no\npre-existing routes for collaboration and appropriate\nengagement and so relationships and mechanisms\nhad to be created to achieve the objective. In many\nways this represents a challenge in cultural change for\nboth industry and academia.\n5.3.5.2 Key lessons learnt in relation to industry\u2013\nuniversity collaboration: The FLAVIIR experience has\nshown that it is absolutely crucial to develop close rela-\ntionships between industry and academia if the nature\nof academic research is to be changed. The involve-\nment of appropriate industrial people, with technical\nexpertise, knowledge of industrial priorities, and the\nability to influence internal industry attitudes towards\nacademic research, has been crucial and FLAVIIR had\nto identify and implement means of achieving this.\nChange such as that sought by FLAVIIR cannot be\nachieved by an administrative or financial relationship\nalone; close technical and programmatic engagement\nis essential and, on the industrial side, this has required\na strong, ongoing commitment by BAESystems.Within\nacademia this has required close engagement by the\nacademics in each research area with industrial tech-\nnical experts and cooperation by the Technical Direc-\ntor and the academic research leads in shaping the\nresearch plans and emphasis in response to the prior-\nities set by industrial relevance and needs. Flexibility\nand cooperation has been essential from all parties.\nThis showed itself most vividly in the downselection of\ntechnologies that was undertaken, reducing the wide\nrange of initial research areas that had been investi-\ngated into priority areas for investigation, notably in\nthe DEMON technology demonstrator activities. This\nprioritization was driven by industrial exploitation\nopportunities as described below and led to several of\nthe initial research areas not receiving FLAVIIR fund-\ning in the later stages of the programme. In all cases\nthe cooperation and understanding of the academics\nwas essential in maintaining good relationships. The\nFLAVIIR approach to industrial exploitation is such an\nimportant part of the programme that it is described\nfurther below.\n5.4 Industrial focus on exploitation of research\nThe aim of FLAVIIR to engage with industry at\nhigher TRLs is driven by an objective of taking aca-\ndemic research closer to industrial exploitation. In\norder for industry to be able to exploit the tech-\nnologies arising from the research into real prod-\nucts, or to incorporate improvements in processes,\nmethods, and tools arising from the research into\ntheir practices, effort is required on the part of\nindustry to explicitly link the research outcomes to\ntheir business needs and opportunities. Often this is\nnot done very explicitly within industry and it can\neven be a problem in the exploitation of in-house\nresearch, let alone external research from academia.\nFor the FLAVIIR programme, BAESystems has fully\nrecognized the importance of a clear focus within\nthe company on business need and corresponding\nresearch exploitation. The company has implemented\na rigorous approach of Research and Technology\nRoadmapping that links business need, expressed with\nspecific projects and products as targets, to research\nprogress and outcomes, expressed as plans for the\nprogressive increasing of TRLs, and to programmes\nsuch as FLAVIIR that are delivering them. Such an\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO580\nThe FLAVIIR programme in aeronautical engineering 363\napproach provides an explicit basis for expressing\nthe exploitation paths for FLAVIIR technologies, pro-\ncesses, and methods. In addition to using these\nRoadmaps to derive outcome priorities for FLAVIIR\nlinked to clearly defined exploitation paths and tar-\ngets, the company assigned a highly experienced,\nsenior engineer as an Exploitation manager to own the\nidentification and management of these exploitation\npaths. Through these initiatives, the FLAVIIR research\nhas already linked into several real projects within\nBAESystems, with agreed plans for the incorpora-\ntion of the research outputs into wider company\nprojects.\n5.4.1 Challenges faced in relation to industrial\nexploitation of university research\nSeveral challenges were apparent in achieving the\npractical exploitation of FLAVIIR research. First, it\nis clearly crucial that industry itself expresses its\nexploitation opportunities and priorities. However,\nthese are often linked to commercially sensitive strate-\ngies, projects, and plans and so are not easily shared\nwidely with academia. Second, academics are pri-\nmarily judged by achieving academic publications\nin respected journals and this is important for their\ncareer progression; a focus on industrial exploitation is\nnot always a direct match with such criteria and so aca-\ndemics must be prepared to be focused on industrial\nexploitation and a way found to reconcile any conflict\nwith open publication.\n5.4.2 Key lessons learnt in relation to industrial\nexploitation of university research\nThe FLAVIIR experience has shown that making aca-\ndemic research more relevant to, and exploitable by,\nindustry places obligations on both parties. Industry\nmust develop a clear internal approach to identifying\ntheir research needs, the associated TRL develop-\nment path and timescale and the target business\nopportunity, as well as being able to engage with\nacademics on these issues and incorporate the aca-\ndemic research into their organizational approach.\nAcademics must be able to publish their research\noutcomes in respected journals; in order to achieve\nthis on FLAVIIR a review process was established\nwhereby all universities involved signed up to appro-\npriate non-disclosure agreements and papers were\nassessed by BAESystems prior to submission to ensure\nthat no commercially sensitive content was included.\nHowever, the company did not impose unnecessary\nor unreasonable restrictions on academic publica-\ntions during this process. This process was therefore\nsuccessful in allowing academics to publish while\nenabling the company to be confident in sharing the\nlevel of information necessary to achieve exploitation.\n6 FINAL REMARKS\nThe FLAVIIR programme is an exciting research pro-\ngramme that encompasses a wide range of technolo-\ngies, processes, and methods. However, its objectives\nare much more radical than a conventional academic\nresearch programme. It is taking academic research\nto higher Technology Readiness Levels and closer to\nindustrial exploitation than is traditionally the case.\nThis has been a strong focus across the FLAVIIR pro-\ngramme, with academics and industrialists working\ntogether to bridge the so-called \u2018TRL Valley of Death\u2019.\nThis demands new capabilities within academia to\nwork as multidisciplinary teams and to develop, man-\nufacture, assemble, integrate, test, and fly a represen-\ntative uninhabited air vehicle. It also demands new,\nclose relationships between the academic researchers\nand industry, to collaborate on the research itself\nand on its business exploitation. Finally, it requires\nnew capabilities within industry itself, with an explicit\nfocus being required on linking research outputs to\nbusiness needs and exploitation opportunities and\nalso on the means by which the industrial projects\nand capabilities would accommodate the innovations\narising from the research.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe author acknowledges the technical and financial\nsupport for the project from BAE SYSTEMS and the\nEPSRC (Grant Number GR\/S71552\/01).\n\u00a9 Author 2010\nREFERENCES\n1 McDougall, N.
