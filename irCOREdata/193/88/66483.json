Of great interest is the\nstability of topological structures, such as vortices and\ndark solitary waves. Recent experiments at low tempera-\ntures have highlighted the temperature-independent crys-\ntallization [2] and decay [3] of vortex structures. Related\ntheoretical work has indicated the importance of vortex-\nsound interactions [4]. Following the recent experimental\nobservation of dark solitary waves (henceforth referred to\nas dark solitons) in BEC\u2019s [5], one can now study the\ncoupling of solitons to the background sound field.\nDark solitons are robust localized one-dimensional\ndefects characterised by a notch in the ambient conden-\nsate density and a phase slip across the center. They are\nsupported in repulsive (defocusing) nonlinear media\nwhere the kinetic dispersion of the wave is balanced\nby the nonlinear interaction. In three-dimensional ge-\nometries they are prone to decay into lower energy topo-\nlogical structures such as vortex rings [6]. However, in\nquasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) geometries, where the\ntransverse condensate size is of the order of the healing\nlength, solitons are expected to exhibit longer lifetimes,\ndue to the suppression of transverse excitations [7].\nIn the context of nonlinear optics [8], dark solitons on a\nhomogeneous background can become intrinsically un-\nstable to modifications of the nonlinearity within the\noptical medium (e.g., due to saturation effects) [9]. In\nquasi-1D BEC\u2019s, modified nonlinearities can arise from\nthe transverse dimensions that have been integrated out,\nas considered for longitudinally homogeneous conden-\nsates in [10]. The longitudinal confinement of current\natomic BEC experiments leads to an additional mecha-\nnism by which the integrability of the system can be\nbroken [11\u201313]. In this Letter we perform detailed quan-\ntitative analysis of the stability of dark solitons in quasi-\n1D geometries under longitudinal confinement, and find\nthat dissipation due to the longitudinal inhomogeneity\ndominates over decay arising from coupling to transverse\nmodes [10]. Our axial configuration consists of a tight\ndimple trap (where the soliton resides) embedded in a\nweaker harmonic potential. Such a geometry enables us to\ncontrol and examine the interplay between sound emis-\nsion and reabsorption by the oscillating soliton. In the\nlimit of no reabsorption, the rate of emission is found to\nbe proportional to the local soliton acceleration squared,\nas predicted for optical solitons in homogeneous non-\nlinear waveguides [9]. Finally we propose a controllable\nexperiment where the soliton-sound interactions can be\nquantified by measuring the amplitude and frequency of\nthe soliton oscillations.\nOur analysis is based on numerical simulations of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), describing the dynam-\nics of weakly interacting BEC\u2019s in the limit of low\ntemperature,\ni \u0001h\n@ \n@t\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0001h\n2\n2m\nr2 \u0004 Vext \u0004 gj j2 : (1)\nHere  is the order parameter of the system, Vext the\nconfining potential, m the atomic mass, and g \u0001\n4\n \u0001h2a=m the scattering amplitude, where a is the s-\nwave scattering length.

Sound waves\ngenerated by the oscillating soliton can either be trapped\nwithin the dimple or escape to the outer trap, depending\non the value of the cutoff V0 relative to the chemical\npotential \u00161D. For a sufficiently weak outer trap, the\ndensity in the outer region and close to the dimple be-\ncomes approximately homogeneous [Fig. 1(b)], and as a\nfirst approximation we initially solve the 1D GPE in the\nlimit !\u0017 \u0001 0. We shall return to the experimentally rele-\nvant case of !\u0017 \u0001 0 and 3D simulations later. The effect\nof the emitted sound on soliton dynamics can be deter-\nmined by monitoring the \u2018\u2018soliton energy\u2019\u2019 [15], a quan-\ntity determined by integrating the functional,\n\"\u0006 \b \u0001 \u0001h\n2\n2m\njr j2 \u0004 Vextj j2 \u0004 g2 j j\n4; (4)\nacross the soliton region (zs \u000e 5\u0014) and subtracting the\ncorresponding contribution of the background fluid.\nFigure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the soliton\nenergy for different cutoffs (corresponding to different\namounts of sound reabsorption), all of which display a\nperiodicity of approximately !z=\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n2\np\ndue to the motion of\nthe soliton in the trap [11\u201313]. One can discriminate two\nlimiting cases: (i) For sufficiently high cutoffs (here V0 \u000f\n1:2\u00161D) all emitted sound becomes trapped in the dimple,\nleading principally to the excitation of the dipole mode\n[11]. The combined effect of the dipole mode and soliton,\noscillating at different frequencies, induces beating of\ncharacteristic period \u001a \u0010 22!\u00021z (see Fig. 2). (ii) For\nlow cutoffs (V0 \r 0:4\u00161D) there is essentially pure emis-\nsion (no reabsorption) of sound by the soliton. This be-\nhavior is consistent with the change in energy\nexperienced by a classical particle of negative mass os-\ncillating in a harmonic trap, subject to a dissipative force\nwhich induces an energy loss proportional to the accel-\neration squared [16]. The observation that the soliton\ndynamics changes significantly around V0 \u0010 \u00161D (since\nsound excitations have energy of the order of the chemical\npotential) provides a sensitive handle on the soliton-sound\ninteraction, which can be controlled experimentally.\nThe dissipative dynamics of a dark soliton in a shallow\ndimple trap are investigated in Fig. 3. As the soliton\noscillates, it becomes asymmetrically deformed [16] and\ntries to adjust to the inhomogeneous background by radi-\nating counterpropagating sound pulses [Fig. 3(a)].\nFigure 3(b) shows the power emitted by the soliton as a\nfunction of time. At the bottom of the trap there is no\nsound emission since Eq. (2) becomes the local solution to\nthe GPE, while at the zenith of the first few oscillations,\nthe soliton radiates maximum power. This sound emission\n(which modifies the soliton depth) leads to an increase in\nthe soliton speed and amplitude of oscillations, which in\nturn causes a gradual increase in the peak power radiated.\nAs the soliton approaches the edge of the dimple, it\nexperiences a smoothing of the effective potential due\nto fluid healing. This reduces the emission at the trap\nedge, as manifested in the \u2018\u2018intermediate\u2019\u2019 dips at !zt \u0010\n25 and 29:5. Eventually at !zt \u0010 35 the soliton escapes\nthe trap [11].\nIn the context of nonlinear optics, multiscale asymp-\ntotic techniques predict that an unstable optical soliton,\npropagating in a homogeneous nonlinear waveguide,\nemits sound at a rate proportional to the soliton accelera-\ntion squared [9], such that,\ndEs\ndt\n\u0001 \u0002 c\nc2 \u0002 v2\n\u0004\n2c2\nn\n\u0005\n@Ns\n@v\n\u0006\n2\u00042v\n\u0005\n@Ns\n@v\n\u0006\u0005\n@Ss\n@v\n\u0006\n\u0004 n\n2\n\u0005\n@Ss\n@v\n\u0006\n2\n\u0007\u0005\ndv\ndt\n\u0006\n2\n: (5)\nHere n is the local background density, Ss the total phase\nslip across the moving soliton, and Ns \u0001\nR\u0006n\u0002 j j2\bdz\nthe number of particles displaced by the soliton.\nIn the optical case, the breakdown of integrability leading\nto sound emission arises from modifications in the\nnonlinearity within the medium, as opposed to the\nz0\u2212z0\nPosition\nV0\n0\n\u00b5\nPo\nte\nnt\nia\nl\n0\nn0\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nn0\n0\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n10z0\u221210z0\nPosition\n0\n\u00b5\nV0\nPo\nte\nnt\nia\nl\na) b)\n\u03c9\nz\n\u03c9\u03b6\n\u2212z0 z0\nFIG. 1.

It may there-\nfore come as a surprise that this expression could also be\napplicable to the inhomogeneous case. In fact, this can be\nvalid only in double-trap structures of Eq. (3) if the\ndimple trap is sufficiently shallow that it essentially al-\nlows complete escape of sound to the outer trap; even\nthen, this result will hold only until the emitted sound\nreturns to the dimple region after reflection from the\nouter trap. In this limit, the asymptotic conditions be-\ncome practically indistinguishable from the homogeneous\nones, thus justifying the above approach. The validity of\nEq. (5) is not dependent on the origin of the instability,\nbut rather on the fact that the emitted sound escapes from\nthe soliton region. Note that the effect of the dimple\nconfinement is implicit in the variations of the parameters\nSs, c, and n, and, contrary to the homogeneous case [9],\nthis result will hold for all soliton speeds, due to the\ncontinuously induced \u2018\u2018soliton instability\u2019\u2019 caused by\nthe longitudinal confinement. Figure 3(b) confirms the\napplicability of Eqs. (5) (circles) in the limit V0 \u0011 \u00161D\nby direct comparison to the 1D GPE simulations (solid\nline). Further evidence is provided in Fig. 2 which shows\nclearly that as the cutoff is decreased, the variation of\nenergy with time (solid lines) approaches the above ana-\nlytical result in the limit of no reabsorption (dotted line).\nWe stress that Eq. (5) will not hold in the usual infinite\nharmonic traps, where multiscale asymptotic technique\nmust be combined with boundary layer theory [11].\nSimulations of the 3D GPE with cylindrical symmetry\n(still under the assumption of a homogeneous outer trap)\nconfirm the qualitative findings of Fig. 2. In particular, in\nthe limit \u00163D= \u0001h!? \u0010 1:2 (where the soliton was recently\npredicted to be stable against transverse decay [10]) we\nfind the dominant decay mechanism to be due to axial\ninhomogeneity. The coupling to transverse modes [13]\nmerely leads to an additional oscillation of the soliton\nenergy in time (Fig. 4), whose amplitude increases as the\ntransverse confinement is relaxed [17]. Subtracting the\naverage oscillation in the 3D longitudinal energy\n[Fig. 4(b)] from the energy of the soliton region gives\nessentially perfect agreement with the 1D results (Fig. 2).\nFinally we extend our earlier treatment to the experi-\nmentally relevant case of!\u0017 \u0001 0. We consider a BEC in a\nquasi-1D geometry [18] in a cylindrically symmetric trap\nwith frequencies !\u0017 (longitudinal) and !? (transverse),\nand then add an inner dimple potential (!z), such that the\nlongitudinal confinement is as shown in Fig. 1. This could\nbe realized, for example, by a dimple microtrap created\noptically within a larger magnetic trap. The key points for\nsuch a realization are (i) a very weak longitudinal trap\nfrequency!\u0017 , such that the sound escaping from the inner\ntrap is not reflected back from the outer trap within the\ntime scale of interest, and (ii) a sufficiently tight inner\ntrap !z such that the oscillating soliton emits sound at a\nrate fast enough that its amplitude increases noticeably\nbefore other decay mechanisms become important.\nExperimentally, the effect of soliton-sound interac-\ntions can be probed by determining the soliton path via\nrepeated time of flight measurements, and comparing\npaths for different depths of the dimple trap. The best\nsignature for this effect arises when comparing the case\nof an effectively infinite cutoff to that of a lower cutoff,\nwhich nonetheless permits a sufficient number of soliton\noscillations. Since the soliton rapidly escapes the trap for\nV0 <\u00161D, we thus propose the use of V0 \u0001 \u00161D as a\nlow cutoff, for which the soliton remains confined and\n50\n55\n60\n65\n0 20 40 60 80\nt  (\u03c9\nz\n\u22121)\n0\n5\nE \n (h\n\u03c9\nz\/2\n\u03c0\n)\na)\nb)\nFIG. 4.

These effects become more noticeable in the\nGaussian trap, for which the required cutoff for total\nsound entrapment is larger than the harmonic one.\nChoosing \u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 parameters !\u0017 \u0001 2\n\u0012 5 Hz, !z \u0001\n10!\u0017 , and !? \u0001 250!\u0017 and \u00163D \u0001 8 \u0001h! where ! \u0001\n\u0006!\u0017!2?\b1=3, we find, respectively, for a 23Na (87Rb) con-\ndensate, a one-dimensional peak dimple density of n1D \u0001\n5\u0012 107 (1:5\u0012 107) m\u00021, condensate atom number N \u0001\n18 000 (3 500) and a total observation time scale for Fig. 5\nof \u001aexp \u0001 220 ms, consistent with the expected soliton\nlifetime in such systems [10\u201312].\nIn summary, we have performed quantitative studies of\nthe dynamics of dark solitons oscillating in trapped\nquasi-one-dimensional Bose condensates under longitu-\ndinal double-trap confinement. This geometry is ideal for\ncontrolling the interplay between sound emission and\nreabsorption, and we have identified two limiting cases:\n(i) In the limit of no reabsorption, the power emitted by\nthe soliton is proportional to the square of its acceleration.\n(ii) The opposite limit of effectively infinite traps (such as\nharmonic traps in which soliton experiments have been\nperformed) leads to the anticipated stabilization against\nsoliton decay. We suggest that the sound radiation can be\nquantified by tracking the position of the dark soliton in\nsuitably engineered traps, which allow for precise control\nof the soliton-sound interaction.\nWe acknowledge discussions with C.
