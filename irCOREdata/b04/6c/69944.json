Separate analyses are done for\nstorms that result in strong relativistic electron enhancements and those that do not. The\ninferred whistler instability is strongest in the midnight-to-dawn sector, where freshly\ninjected plasma-sheet electrons drift into and through the inner magnetosphere. During\nthe main phase of both sets of storms, there is a marked drop in the whistler growth\nparameter, especially in the prime midnight-to-dawn sector. In the early recovery phase,\nthis parameter is elevated and then returns to more typical values over the next few days.\nThe elevation of the whistler growth parameter persists longer for the electron-enhanced\nstorms than for those that do not produce such enhancements. These results suggest that\nwhistler wave generation is greater during storms yielding enhanced levels of relativistic\nelectrons.\n& 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nRelativistic electrons in the inner magnetosphere are\ndamaging to spacecraft, and produce high backgrounds in\nspace environment-monitoring instruments (Baker, 2002;\nMacDonald et al., 2006). Currently, it is not well under-\nstood why some storms are more effective than others in\nproducing relativistic electron enhancements a few days\nafter the storm main phase (Reeves et al., 2003). The roles\nof competing source and loss processes for radiation belt\nparticles are also not resolved (Friedel et al., 2002).\nWhistler mode waves are a candidate mechanism for\nthe acceleration of relativistic electrons during geomag-\nnetic storms. Observational and theoretical evidence\nshows that whistler waves are capable of accelerating.

Of the two whistler chorus bands, the lower\none (fo0.5fce; near the geosynchronous orbit,\u00020.5\u20131.0kHz)\nis most effective in resonating with and accelerating the\nenergetic electron seed population (Meredith et al., 2003).\nWhistler waves are associated with increased substorm\nactivity in the recovery phase of geomagnetic storms\n(Meredith et al., 2001). Akebono wave observations\nshowed that the peak of the whistler intensity propa-\ngates to higher L during the recovery phase (Miyoshi\net al., 2003, 2007). However, due to the inherent\nlow sampling statistics for in situ wave observations, a\nglobal picture of whistler wave activity as a function of\ngeomagnetic storm evolution is difficult to esta-\nblish. Hence, understanding of the complete relationship\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nE.A. MacDonald et al. \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 70 (2008) 1789\u201317961790between enhanced whistler wave activity and enhance-\nments of relativistic electrons remains elusive.\nIt is widely agreed that enhanced whistler waves can\nbe produced by an electron temperature anisotropy\ninstability, which then scatters the electrons, thereby\nreducing the anisotropy. The scattering has been shown\nby simulations and observations to constrain the electron\nanisotropy to lie at or below the linear theory threshold\nfor the instability, which can be expressed in the form:\nT?;e\nTpar;e\n\u0003 1 \u00bc Se\nbaepar;e\n, (1)\nwith parallel electron beta, bpar,e \u00bc 8pneTpar,e\/B02 (e.g. Gary\nand Wang, 1996). T?,e and Tpar,e are the electron tempera-\ntures perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the\nmagnetic field, and B0 is the magnetic field magnitude.\nThe parameters Se and ae can be derived by fits to linear\ntheory results, assuming a constant maximum growth\nrate gmax\/Oe, where Oe is the electron cyclotron frequency\n(Gary and Wang, 1996). The value of the fitting parameter\nae is generally between 0.4 and 0.6, but Se depends more\nstrongly on the growth rate. For a Maxwellian or Kappa\ndistribution, a growth rate of g\/Oe \u00bc 0.001 and ae \u00bc 0.6, Se\ncannot be larger than 0.21 because the waves scatter the\nthermal electrons so as to reduce the instability growth\nrate (Gary et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2006). The whistler\ninstability should therefore impose an upper bound on the\nelectron temperature anisotropy that varies as a function\nof bpar,e. The first observational test of this constraint was\npresented by Gary et al. (2005) using data from the Cluster\n1 spacecraft as it traversed the dayside magnetosheath.\nIn this paper, we develop a proxy for whistler wave\ngrowth based on the properties of the hot plasma-sheet\nelectron population during geomagnetic storms. In this\nway, the availability of simultaneous plasma particle data\nfrom multiple Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites can\ncounteract the relative dearth of plasma wave data in this\nregion. Superposed epoch analysis using electron mea-\nsurements from the Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzers\n(MPAs) on multiple Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites\n(Bame et al., 1993; McComas et al., 1993) is ideal to\nevaluate the global dynamics of this population as a\nfunction of local time and storm phase. For this study,\nthese comparisons are made for sets of storms with and\nwithout a strong relativistic electron response at geosyn-\nchronous orbit in order to elucidate the role of whistler\nwaves in the mechanisms of relativistic electron enhance-\nment and dynamics.2. Data\nTwo sets of storms are selected following the criteria of\nO\u2019Brien et al. (2001, 2003), also applied by Smith et al.\n(2004b) in their study of chorus waves using ground\nobservations. We take the same event list as Smith et al.\n(2004b), expanded to include storms in the 3 earlier years\nwhich are covered by the geosynchronous particle\ndatabase. There are also some slight differences in our\nlist compared to that used by Smith et al. (2004b) due to\nsporadic data gaps from either source. Selected stormshave a minimum Dst less than \u000350nT and cover the time\nperiod 1989\u20132002. Of this set only isolated storms are\nchosen, specifically those without storm minima closer\nthan 4 days. Following the example of O\u2019Brien et al. (2003)\nand Smith et al. (2004b), storms are sorted into events\nand non-events based on whether or not the \u2018\u2018noon-\nreconstructed\u2019\u2019 1.8\u20133.5MeV electron flux measured by\nLos Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellites\n48\u201372h after the Dst minimum exceeds 0.5 e\u0003\/cm2s srkeV.\nAs described by O\u2019Brien et al. (2001), the noon-recon-\nstructed flux is based on a statistical technique to remove\nthe local time variations in radiation belt particles and\nnormalize the fluxes to that of a virtual geosynchronous\nspacecraft located at noon. In summary, our study\nincludes 138 event storms (more enhanced post-storm\nMeV electron response) and 183 non-event storms (less\nenhanced MeV electron response).\nEvent selection based on these criteria, specifically\nonly the post-storm fluxes, is justifiable since the pre-\nstorm flux was shown to be uncorrelated with the post-\nstorm flux by Reeves et al. (2003). As shown in Fig. 1 (and\nalso by Smith et al., 2004b) both sets of storms have very\nsimilar superposed epoch Dst profiles, although events\nhave longer elevated Kp levels. This is consistent with the\nfindings of O\u2019Brien et al. (2001) that the relativistic\nelectron response is uncorrelated with the size of the\nstorm (based on Dst) but is related to the strength of\nconvection (as proxied by Kp) and recovery phase sub-\nstorm activity.\nThe extensive database of LANL-GEO MPA plasma\nspectrometer measurements from seven geosynchronous\nsatellites is used in the present superposed epoch analysis.\nThe electron moments are calculated for the population\nfrom 30eV to 45keV according to the methods described\nin Thomsen et al. (1999). Superposed epoch analysis of the\nplasma moments and other parameters, with zero epoch\ntime at the minimum of Dst, was done following the\nmethod of Denton et al. (2005), used also by Denton et al.\n(2006) and Lavraud et al. (2005). Parallel electron beta\nwas calculated at each point using the dynamic T89 model\n(Tysganenko, 1989), since in situ measurements of\nmagnetic field strength were not available. Each analysis\nwas done separately for the event and non-event sets of\nstorms.\nFig. 2(a\u2013d) shows the electron density and temperature\nas functions of local time and epoch time for the sets of\nevents and non-events. Notably, for these parameters the\nstorm-time characteristics of the events and non-events\nare very similar to the sets of co-rotating interaction\nregion (CIR) and coronal mass ejection-driven storms,\nrespectively, as studied by Denton et al. (2006). The\naverage density of the electron population peaks post-\nmidnight near Dst minimum and reaches a minimum near\nnoon. This is consistent with the plasmasheet moving\ninward of geosynchronous orbit in the main phase of the\nstorm, observed first near midnight and then spreading in\nlocal time (Denton et al., 2006). Non-events have higher\ndensity than events around Dst minimum and in the\nstorm recovery phase.\nThe temperature (defined as one-third the sum of\ntwice the perpendicular temperature and the parallel\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nEVENTS NON-EVENTS\n\u22121.0 +1.0 +2.00.0\nEpoch Time (days)\n\u22121.0 +1.0 +2.00.0\nEpoch Time (days)\n\u22121.0 +1.0 +2.00.0\nEpoch Time (days)\n\u22121.0 +1.0 +2.00.0\nEpoch Time (days)\n0\n\u221250\n\u2212100\n\u2212150\n\u2212200\nD\nst\n In\nde\nx\nK\np \nIn\nde\nx\n9\n6\n3\n0\n0\n\u221250\n\u2212100\n\u2212150\n\u2212200\nD\nst\n In\nde\nx\nK\np \nIn\nde\nx\n9\n6\n3\n0\nFig. 1.

As\ndiscussed by Denton et al. (2005), Ae is closest to unity at\nmidnight due to the isotropy of freshly arriving tail\nplasma. It then increases towards noon as particles drift\nthrough the inner magnetosphere and precipitate (Korth\net al., 1999). The most distinctive feature of the epoch-\ntime behavior is the wide local-time range of the decrease\nin Ae around the storm main phase. The region of local\ntime and epoch time where this occurs is consistent with\nthe enhanced electron densities observed in Fig. 2(a and b)\nbeing a quite isotropic plasmasheet population. This\noccurs for both event and non-event storms, and was\nnoted earlier by Denton et al. (2006). An alternate\nexplanation for the observed isotropy may be that an\nabundance of waves rapidly isotropizes the distributions.\nAs shown in Fig. 3(a and b) the values and evolution of\nthe parallel plasma beta look fairly similar for the events\nand the non-events because the aforementioned differ-\nences in the density and temperature (particularly in the\nrecovery phase) counteract each other. However, events\nhave a higher beta in the recovery phase, while non-\nevents have a higher beta in the stormmain phase, around\nthe time of Dst minimum.\nIn Eq. (1), Se and ae are parameters determined by fits\nto the theoretical whistler instability threshold condi-\ntions. Here we use our geosynchronous data set to\ncalculate the observational analog of Se, what we call the\nwhistler growth parameter\nX\ne\n\u00bc baepar;e\nT?;e\nTpar;e\n\u0003 1\n\u0002 \u0003\n, (2)\nand we follow the theoretical results of Gary et al. (2005)\nin choosing ae \u00bc 0.60. Results are plotted in Fig. 3(c and d).Relatively large values of Se are interpreted as correspond-\ning to strongly unstable conditions, whereas smaller\nvalues of this parameter represent weakly unstable or\nstable conditions.\nThe superposed epoch results show enhanced values of\nSe between midnight and noon, in general agreement\nwith the global distribution of chorus amplitude inferred\nfrom in situ wave measurements (Meredith et al., 2001).\nOur measure of whistler-mode wave growth seems to\ncorrespond to the equatorial lower-band chorus Meredith\net al. (2001) observed during active times. There is a\nmarked decrease in Se in the \u000212h prior to Dst minimum\n(i.e. in the storm main phase) from midnight to dawn (see\nSection 3 for more detail). Values for the events appear\nslightly higher than for the non-events in the recovery\nphase. Since an order of magnitude smaller whistler\ngrowth rate only changes Se from 0.21 to 0.15, the modest\ndifference in the observed values of Se between events\nand non-events is significant (Gary et al., 2005).\n3. Discussion\nThe average values of Se for both sets of storms shown\nin Fig. 3 are lower than the value of 0.21 anticipated for a\nmodest growth rate of 0.001Oe, based on a Maxwellian\nelectron velocity distribution. Since the superposed epoch\nvalues for Se are significantly below the value for marginal\nstability of the whistler mode, we examine the variability\nof the points that were averaged within each hourly bin of\nlocal time vs. epoch time. Fig. 4 shows the results of a\nwhistler anisotropy threshold test similar to Gary et al.\n(2005). For a whistler instability threshold condition\ncorresponding to a growth rate of 0.001Oe, Se \u00bc 0.21 and\nae \u00bc 0.6; then Eq. (1) yields the straight line shown on the\nlog plots of (Ae\u00031) versus bpar,e (where the slope depends\non ae and the intercept on Se). The proximity to the\nthreshold instability line of measured values of anisotropy\nat a given beta indicates approaching the limit of stability.\nIn Fig. 4, all the individual measurements of (Ae\u00031) and\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nEVENTS NON-EVENTS\nDENSITY : HOT ELECTRONS DENSITY : HOT ELECTRONS\nTEMPERATURE : HOT ELECTRONSTEMPERATURE : HOT ELECTRONS\nPERP\/PAR RATIO : HOT ELECTRONS PERP\/PAR RATIO : HOT ELECTRONS\n+2.0\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n1.8\n1.2\n1.5\n0.9\n1.8\n1.2\n1.5\n0.9\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n12 18 24 6 12\n0.0\n+2.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\n+2.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\n+2.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\n+2.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\n+2.0\n+1.0\n\u22121.0\n0.0\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\nU\nT \n\u2212\n U\nT m\nin\n|D\nst\n| (\nD\nay\ns)\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n (c\nm\n\u2212\n3 )\nTE\nM\nP\nE\nR\nA\nTU\nR\nE\n (e\nV\n)\nTE\nM\nP\nE\nR\nA\nTU\nR\nE\n (e\nV\n)\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n (c\nm\n\u2212\n3 )\nLOCAL TIME\n12 18 24 6 12\nLOCAL TIME\n12 18 24 6 12\nLOCAL TIME\n12 18 24 6 12\nLOCAL TIME\n12 18 24 6 12\nLOCAL TIME\n12 18 24 6 12\nLOCAL TIME\nFig. 2.

(2001) based on CRRES data.\nWe extend that result since CRRES coverage near\ngeosynchronous orbit was limited. The difference in\nstability between post-midnight (a) and near dusk (c) is\nmost striking. Only event storms are shown in this\nexample as not much difference is evident when compar-\ning events to non-events using this representation.\nFig. 5(a) shows the epoch time behavior of the whistler\ngrowth parameter averaged over local time from midnight\nto noon for both events and non-events. Plotted in this\nmanner, there is a more distinct increase in Se observed\nin the events than the non-events during the late\nstorm recovery phase from \u00021 day after Dst minimum\nto \u00024 days. At other times, the distributions are quite\nsimilar. Fig. 5 also shows that the values for Se recede to\nquiet-time behavior approximately 4\u20135 days after the\nminimum of Dst and that the average value is quite variable.\nFig. 5(b) shows the distribution of lower band chorus\nwaves measured by a ground-based VLF receiver fromHalley station (L \u00bc 4.3), Antarctica, for the set of storms\nstudied by Smith et al. (2004b) (adapted from Fig. 2, Smith\net al., 2004b). The similarity of Fig. 5(a) and (b) is quite\nstriking. This confirms that our technique to derive the\nwhistler growth parameter from electron measurements\naccurately corresponds to direct wave measurements. For\nevents and non-events, Fig. 5(b) shows an approximately\ntwo-fold decrease in the magnetic field spectral density at\nwhistler chorus frequencies during the main phase. Smith\net al. (2004a, b) attributed this decrease to an ionospheric\nattenuation effect during the storm main phase. Since this\ndecrease is also evident in the geosynchronous growth\nparameter, it may in fact be a product of reduced growth\nin the magnetosphere, rather than a propagation effect.\nDuring the recovery phase, Fig. 5(b) shows that chorus\nintensities increased by a factor of \u00023 (relative to the\naverage quiet-time value). Very similar to our space-based\ninference of the whistler wave distribution, the ground-\nbased observations showed more whistler waves for\nevents than non-events, with the difference maximizing\n\u00021\u20132 days after Dst minimum is reached.

Conclusions\nA superposed epoch study of electron parameters\nmeasured at geosynchronous orbit relating to the growth\nof the whistler anisotropy instability was performed on\nmagnetic storms with and without significant post-storm\nrelativistic electron enhancements. Overall, the Dst profile\nof the two sets of storms looked very similar, although\nevents with enhancements showed higher Kp in the\nrecovery phase, consistent with the supposition that\nhigher solar wind speed storms (e.g. CIR events) are\ncorrelated with enhanced relativistic electron production\nin the magnetosphere (O\u2019Brien et al., 2001). The electron\nplasma population was overall less dense and hotter from\nDst minimum through the recovery phase for events\ncompared with non-events. During the storm main phase,\na dense, isotropic electron population arrived in the\nmidnight region and became more anisotropic towards\nnoon, reflecting drift paths and precipitation through the\ninner magnetosphere. For events relative to non-events,\nthe electron parallel beta was significantly higher during\nthe recovery phase though lower during the storm main\nphase.\nThe observed whistler growth parameter, defined by\nEq. (2), exhibits the same limiting behavior expected byquasi-linear theory and demonstrated previously\nfor the magnetosheath and the solar wind (Gary and\nWang, 1996; Gary et al., 2005; Stverak et al., 2008).\nThis parameter was enhanced for the events compared\nwith the non-events, particularly in the late recovery\nphase. In addition, the temporal behavior of whistler\nwave growth during storms was very similar to that\nderived by Smith et al. (2004b) using ground-based wave\nobservations.\nIn conclusion, this evidence suggests that whistler\nwave generation is higher for storms which result in\nenhanced relativistic electron production. The time with\nthe strongest enhancement in the whistler growth para-\nmeter is \u00021.5 days after storm maximum, which is also\nthe time significant for the production and observation of\nrelativistic electrons. This suggests that whistler wave\ngrowth as inferred from the source electron population at\ngeosynchronous orbit can indeed be observed and related\nto relativistic electron enhancements. However, since\ntheory suggests that the electron acceleration should be\nmost effective right outside the plasmapause (Summers\net al., 1998), the difference may be much larger at smaller\nL. In situ particle measurements could be used to examine\nthe strength and timing predicted for whistler wave\ngrowth closer to the plasmapause during geomagnetic\nstorms.\nThis instability analysis technique using particle\nmeasurements as a proxy is useful because direct wave\nmeasurements are not always available. The whistler\ngrowth parameters could be examined for specification or\nre-analysis studies over a full solar cycle (e.g. O\u2019Brien and\nLemon, 2007). This technique could also be applied to\nother regions and other wave modes.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nE.A.
