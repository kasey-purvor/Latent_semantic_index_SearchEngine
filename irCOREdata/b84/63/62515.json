Results \npresented here were obtained from particle deposits on filters, collected during the \ntime when the use of leaded petrol was significantly reduced and then totally \nphased out (1998 - 2001). \n Pb is a major anthropogenic pollutant originating from mining and smelting, \ncurrent and historical industrial activities, fossil fuel combustion and incineration. \nPrior to the turn of the millenium the main source of Pb was the exhaust of \nvehicles using leaded petrol.1 Pb emissions from leaded petrol peaked in the 1970s \nand 1980s at c.375,000 t a-1, with the UK contributing >7000 t a-1.1,2 Atmospheric \naerosols are one of the principal media in which this anthropogenic Pb is \ntransported, particularly the inhalable particulate fraction (particles <10 \u03bcm in \naerodynamic diameter, or PM10), and can travel significant distances.3,4 Facilitated \nby aerosol transport, Pb contamination of the environment reached global \nproportions as demonstrated by elevated Pb concentration levels above pre-\nindustrial values as recorded in ice sheets, lake and marine sediments and peat \ndeposits world-wide.5-13 \n TIMS-based studies show that aerosol Pb isotope compositions vary \nconsiderably on a global scale.14  Each major industrial sector\u2019s predominant Pb \noutput reflects a few dominant sources that ultimately derive from a relatively \nlimited number of ore deposits at any one time, or are a relatively constant mix of \nmany Pb sources. There is sufficient regional variation in the Pb isotope signature \nof aerosols to facilitate apportionment of aerosol Pb sourced from different \ngeographical\/industrial domains at a given moment in time. In large complex \nurban centres and highly industrialised areas the anthropogenic Pb composition is \ntypically a mix of locally-derived, and potentially distally-derived Pb.15-16. \n Characterising these isotope compositions at an instant in time and examining \nthe changes over a long time span provides important information concerning the \nrise and fall of particular anthropogenic inputs.14,17 \n There is strong evidence linking adverse health effects with high overall \natmospheric aerosol concentrations in cities.18-20  Precisely which components of \nthe aerosols are the most damaging remains unknown although PM10 particles \noriginating from diesel combustion show the strongest association with adverse \neffects.21,22 Furthermore, the Pb from the aerosols is known to have an important \nhealth impact due to its transfer to the blood stream via absorption directly from \nPM10 deposited deep in the lungs, which is in addition to the general respiratory \nand cardiovascular impact of PM10.3 Given these significant health effects it is \nimportant to relate the source to the mass contribution of PM10 deposits, and \nchemical and isotopic fingerprinting are important in this respect. During the time \nthat tetraethyl Pb was added to petrol, monitoring Pb concentration and isotope \ncomposition provided valuable information on traffic-related contributions to \nPM10. Establishing changes in the isotopic signature following withdrawal of \nleaded petrol is therefore clearly important to source contribution studies in the \nfuture. \n The UK reduced the Pb content of leaded petrol in 1986 from ~ 0.34 g l-1 to \n0.143 g l-1 and after 1987 unleaded petrol sales increased markedly.2 By 1998 and \n1999, emissions had fallen to less than 1000 t a-1 and yet leaded petrol was still the \nmain contributor to atmospheric Pb emissions. In the period 1970 to the end of \n1999, Pb emissions from vehicle exhausts declined by 97% and leaded petrol was \nfinally withdrawn from general sale at the end of 1999. As a consequence, \nemissions declined even further in 2000 and 2001, resulting in a marked decline in \natmospheric concentrations. In central London (Cromwell Road), the annual mean \nPb concentration was 1.45 \u00b5g m-3 in 1985 whilst in the years 1990, 1999 and 2002, \nconcentrations were 0.38, 0.068, and 0.027 \u00b5g m-3 respectively.2 \nUMethodology \nPM10 Characteristics and Sample Collection \nPM10 are very heterogeneous, comprising inorganic solids, organic substances, \nelemental carbon and water.  This heterogeneity is a function of the diverse \nsources of this material, which include sea salt, windblown dusts from soils and \nrocks, forest fires and anthropogenic sources of which fossil fuel combustion is the \nmajor source.  Additionally, gas to particle reactions in the atmosphere that \ninclude fossil fuel combustion gases produce condensed products that make a \nsignificant contribution to the mass of PM10.  In the London UK area specifically, \nMoreno et al. (2003)23 show that PM10 are composed of elemental and organic \ncarbon compounds (EOCC), Fe-bearing industrial and traffic-related oxides and \nalloys, nitrates and silicates, and subordinate sulphates and chlorides.  These \nauthors also show that the very fine grained <2.5 \u03bcm particles (PM2.5) have a \nhigher proportion of EOCC and less Fe-bearing particulates and silicates.  EOCC \nparticles are themselves comprised of submicron particles that agglomerate into \nlarger porous composites.24 \n In this study PM10were collected on 47 mm Millipore quartz filters at the \nMarylebone Road air monitoring site using a Rupprecht & Patashnik Partisol \nmodel 2000 air sampler.  The monitoring site is situated at the kerbside of the busy \nMarylebone Road which averages 70 000 passing vehicles per day.  The air \nsampler operates at a rate of 16.7 (\u00b1 7%) litres per minute. The PM10 samples were \ncollected on a 24 hour basis (midnight to midnight GMT) primarily for studies \nconcerned with PM10 total deposit weights and bulk elemental and organic species \ncharacterisation, with this Pb isotope study being an opportunistic addition. \nSamples were taken from archival material and from new samples collected in \nSeptember and October 2000 and December 2001. Samples were also collected \nevery 6 days during each sampling period where possible. \n It is acknowledged that the stochastic nature of weather is such that the same \nconditions will not be evident from one year to the next.  We have therefore \nobtained, courtesy of the Met Office and British Atmospheric Data Centre, a \nsummary of the main meteorological parameters and the 5-day wind trajectory for \neach day on which samples were taken.  These are considered in the interpretation \nof the data. \nSample Preparation and Analysis \nPb aerosol isotope studies are typically based on solution-mode analyses \nemploying analytical techniques similar to those used for isotope analysis of \ngeological materials.  Generally, chromatographic separation of Pb using ion \nexchange resins and isotope ratio determination by TIMS are used4,14-16, although \nsome investigators have also used a combination of TIMS and solution-mode \nquadrupole ICP-MS.17  TIMS analytical approaches have the advantage of \nfacilitating accurate analysis of very small amounts of Pb with high precision, and \nthe highest possible precision if double or triple spiking methods are used.  MC-\nICP-MS is also an established method for high precision Pb isotope analysis, \nparticularly if ample sample is available (10\u2019s of ng of Pb), and was used here. An \nimportant pre-requisite, however, of TIMS or ICP-MS solution-mode analysis is to \nensure filters do not contribute suffient Pb to unduly bias the total Pb isotope \ncomposition away from the isotope composition of the filter deposits alone.  \nRigorously precleaned Teflon filters are therefore typically used to minimize Pb \nblank, especially for studies in areas where particulate loads are very low.14 \n Unfortunately, the design of many urban sampling programs do not consider \nisotope measurements and typically employ non-PTFE filters, and it is these types \nof samples that generally populate filter archives.  This was the case with the \nLondon filter samples studied here.  Nevertheless, although not optimal, it is \npossible to obtain reliable isotope data from cellulose acetate or glass fibre filters \nif the total particulate load contains 100\u2019s of ng of Pb because filter blank \ncontributions can be sufficiently small compared to the aerosol Pb filter deposits \nas to not unduly bias the true sample isotope ratios (blank \u2264 5% of total Pb).16 \n The potential reductions in aerosol Pb collected in our 24 hr samples as leaded \npetrol was entirely phased out suggested the possibility that solution-mode filter \nanalyses on relatively Pb-poor deposits might be biased to a greater degree than \nthe older, potentially higher Pb deposits.  As a result, a preliminarly investigation \nof laser ablation sampling of filter deposits was pursued as a potentially \u201ccleaner\u201d \nsampling protocol that could more selectively sample the filter surface deposits, \nleaving the filter substrate unaffected and relatively unsampled.  Only small \n(<1\/4th-1\/8th) slices of the original filters were available for study, but wherever \npossible these slices were sub-sampled so that LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis could be \ndone in addition to solution-mode MC-ICP-MS. \nSolution Mode \nMC-ICP-MS solution-mode data obtained in our laboratory on both geological and \nenvironmental materials, and also in other MC-ICP-MS laboratories, indicates that \norganic content and purity of the Pb solution strongly relates to data accuracy and \nexternal reproducibility. Every effort, therefore, was made to deliver to the ICP a \nhigh purity Pb solution free of high total dissolved solids and separation media. \n Sample preparation was done in a class 100 clean laboratory.  Reagents were \nTeflon-distilled twice to minimize Pb contributions during chemistry, and water \nwas prepared to 18.2 M\u2126 resistivity (Milli-Q).  Reagent and water blanks \nmeasured by TIMS were on the order of \u22641 pg Pb ml-1.   Filters were handled with \nacid-cleaned polypropylene forceps and cut into sections using stainless steel \nscissors that were pre-cleaned in 2 M HNO3, Milli-Q water and distilled acetone.  \nPb was leached from the filter deposits in 15 ml PFA Teflon vials.  The vials were \npre-cleaned in 8 M HNO3 for 24 hr, rinsed in Milli-Q water, and refluxed on a \nhotplate in 6 M HCl for 16 hr.  Initial filter leaching was done in 1 M HBr for 2 \nhours at room temperature, in a procedure slightly modified from step 1 in \nBollh\u00f6fer et al. (1999).14  This leaching step was expected to remove Pb from the \nmore highly soluble deposits on the filter.  Previous Marylebone Road filter \nstudies indicated a metallic particle contribution from vehicles, including Cu-rich \nparticulates25, and so the initial leaching step residues were further treated in \nsealed PFA vials with 16 M HNO3 for 16 hours at 80\u00baC.  Most of the gray to black \ncarbonaceous material on the filter remained unmoved.  The dissolved species \nfrom the leach steps were combined, dried down, and taken up in 1 M HBr prior to \nchemistry. \n Pb was separated by anion exchange chromatography using Bio-Rad AG1-X8 \nresin in polypropylene columns.  The chemistry step was repeated to further purify \nthe Pb.  Pb separates were dried down and re-dissolved twice in 16 M HNO3 and \nthe analyte was taken up in 0.45 M HNO3.  These steps were taken to ensure \ndestruction of residual resin particles to avoid potential organic contamination \nduring mass spectrometry, which has been observed to reduce analytical \nprecision.26 Pb separates were diluted with ~5 ng g 1-1 natural Tl in 2% HNO3 to a \nvolume of c. 1 ml for introduction into the MC-ICP-MS, with measured  \n205Tl\/203Tl used to correct for instrumental mass fractionation in the plasma.27  \n1998-1999 solutions were analysed on a VG P54 MC-ICP-MS, while 2000 - 2001 \nsolutions were analysed on an Axiom MC-ICP-MS.  The instruments were \noperated in dry plasma mode with samples introduced into the plasma as a dry \naerosol employing an ESI PFA 50 micro-concentric nebuliser (uptake rate of ~50 \n\u03bcl min-1) connected to a Cetac Aridus desolvating unit. Running conditions of the \nP54 and Axiom were virtually the same during the course of this study, and are \nreported in Table 1 of Horstwood et al. (2003).28 Data were collected in static \nmulticollection mode, in 4 blocks of 25 ratios with inter-block peak-centring and \nhalf-mass baseline measurement. Validated washouts better than c. 0.1% of the \nprevious sample were done between runs to avoid cross-contamination. Typical \ntotal Pb ion beams were 5 - 15 x 10-11 A.  Data were normalized to NBS 981 at the \ntime of analysis using the values of Thirlwall (2002).29  In this way any \ninaccuracies between analytical sessions are corrected and the sample data are \ndirectly comparable (e.g. Bouvier et al. 2007).30 \n Blank contributions exclusively from the filters, and the total Pb concentrations \nof some filters, were determined by TIMS on a Finnigan MAT 262. Small \nsegments of  the filters (~0.05 g) were leached as above, and the leachate spiked \nwith a high purity 208Pb tracer (208Pb\/206Pb ~ 14,000) and processed through \nchemistry.   Pb concentrations of 14 aerosol samples ranged from 6.1 to 33 \u03bcg g-1.  \nChemistry plus MC-ICP-MS blanks ranged from 0.25-0.86 ng, with total Pb from \nthe full analytical procedure, which is mainly from the filter material, ranging \nfrom 3-9 ng.  This was sufficiently small (<5% of total Pb) compared to the total \naerosol Pb analysed so that correction for Pb blank was not required for the \nsolution-mode data. \nLaser Ablation Mode \nSamples were ablated using a New Wave Research Microprobe II, 266 nm \nNd:YAG laser system coupled to the MC-ICP-MS using the standard volume (30 \ncm3) ablation cell.  Particulate introduction directly into the plasma while avoiding \nablating fibres from the filters was achieved using a low fluence, dynamic ablation \nprotocol. Laser power was reduced to levels far less than where the laser would \nablate the quartz fibres and a 100-400 \u03bcm diameter beam was rastered over the \nfilter surface. The laser was operated at 10 Hz and focussed on the filter surface.  \nLaser power and rastering speed were adjusted to provide adequate ion-beam size. \n208Pb saturation of the Faraday cup amplifier was avoided in all instances, and \n204Pb ion beams were at least several 10\u2019s of millivolts to ensure good counting \nstatistics.  A small test area on each filter was ablated so that optimial running \nconditions were achieved. Almost all particles along the ablation path were \ndislodged from the filter surface with no attendant damage to the quartz fibres, and \nwere transported directly to the ICP torch in a high-purity argon carrier gas.  The \naffect of the laser on the aerosol particles was not studied in detail but the larger \nparticles were clearly observed being dislodged from the filter rather than \nvaporised, although the fate of the smallest particles is not known.  50-100 static \nmulti-collection ratios were collected in blocks of 25 ratios, with baselines \nmeasured at half-mass positions.  As with the solution-mode analyses, mass bias \ncorrection was made by measuring 205Tl\/203Tl of natural Tl aspirated in 2% HNO3 \nthrough the desolvating nebuliser, and in turn, passed through the ablation cell \nwhere it mixed with the laser-liberated PM10, similar to the protocol used for LA-\nICP zircon geochronology.28  This mass bias correction only accounts for isotope \nfractionation occurring in the ICP source and not at the point of ablation.   As \nthere is no established PM10 standard material with certified isotope composition, \nfractionation arising from processes other than within the plasma could not be \nassessed.  However, because laser fluence parameters were adjusted to simply \ndislodge the particles rather than ablate them, mass fractionation arising at the \npoint of ablation is considered insignificant. Following the solution-mode \nprotocol, instrument accuracy and precision was monitored by running \u2265 6 \nanalyses of Tl-spiked NIST 981 common Pb solution both at the start and end of \nthe analytical sessions, aspirated as above, as well as additional analyses to \nbracket filter analyses.  During the course of analyses both the P54 and Axiom had \na sensitivity of c. 100V ppm-1 Pb.  Potential blank contribution to the overall filter \ndeposit composition was investigated by rastering the laser beam over the surface \nof the heat-treated unexposed filters and monitoring the resulting Pb ion current.  \nTotal Pb ion currents <10-14 A were obtained for blank filters, compared to total \nsample ion currents of >5x10-11 A.  These results were indistinguishable from the \non-peak baselines originating from the carrier gas alone. It is concluded that for \nthe fluence used negligible Pb was extracted from the interstitial spaces between \nthe fibres and the fibre surfaces. \nUResults and Discussion \nThe filter data are summarized in Table 1, and plotted in Figures 1 & 2.  \nUncertainties given in Table 1 are propagated from the internal run precisions (2 \nstd. Err.) and the overall uncertainty of NBS 981 for the analytical session. \n The solution-mode data span a considerable range in 206Pb\/204Pb - 208Pb\/204Pb \nspace, outlining an approximately linear trend.  Data from different sampling \nperiods plot in distinct fields: 1998 and 1999 data plot in distinct clusters, with \nprogressively higher 206Pb\/204Pb - 208Pb\/204Pb (i.e. relatively non-radiogenic to \nmore radiogenic compositions) over time.  The one exception is KCL 016 \n(12\/12\/1998) which plots close to the 1999 data field and far from the otherwise \ntight data cluster for 1998.  It was noted that the prevailing wind direction during \nthe KCL 016 sample period was significantly different than that for the other 1998 \nsamples which may have affected the relative contributions of the different PM10 \nsources.  In contrast, 2000-2001 data overlap. \nLaser ablation data were obtained for 1998 - 1999 filters and two filters from \n2001.  Whereas chemical preparation removed sample matrix for the solution-\nmode samples and facilitated comparable running conditions with the NBS 981 \nstandard, matrix matching of standards with laser ablation samples was not \npossible.  As a result, accuracy and reproducibility could only be determined in a \nless-direct fashion. \n Reproducibility was estimated from replicate analyses of two complete filters \n(i.e. not aliquoted for other analytical purposes).  The two filters  (MB\/2\/038 and \n039) were rastered over a range of areas varying in dimention from ~0.1 cm x 0.8 \ncm up to 2.2 cm x 4.0 cm.  Both filters were analysed under identical instrument \noperating conditions and the data are summarized in Table 1.  Within-run \nanalytical uncertainties of individual analyses for all isotope ratios were on the \norder of \u00b1 0.01 to 0.06% (2SE). Average isotope ratio uncertainties for the \nreplicate filter analyses obtained during a single session were on the order of \u00b1 ~ \n0.3% (2SD), interpreted here as a reasonable estimate of the overall \nreproducibility, accounting for both instrumental variations and within-filter \nheterogeneity.  Agreement of the filter data from the two separate analytical \nsessions was on the order of 0.1% or better. \n Accuracy was explored by comparing laser ablation and solution-mode data on \nthe same filters when permitted by sample availability.  In all cases the isotope \nratios of each sample analysed in both modes agree to better than \u00b1 0.3%, the \nexternal reproducibility estimated by the replicate analyses above.  We would \nconclude that the laser ablation data are accurate to within the level of discernment \nafforded by the estimated external reproducibility and that mass fractionation \nduring analysis was adequately corrected for by Tl-normalization.  Overall, the \nLA-mode data outline the same trend as the solution-mode data (Figure 1), and \ndespite being less precise, the temporal evolution of Pb isotope compositions \ncould have been determined in the absence of solution-mode data. \n In this study, the blank\/sample ratios obtained by laser ablation were ~0.1%, \nsignificantly lower than for solution mode.  This decreased blank effect could be \nusefully exploited in studies where steps cannot be taken to optimize the filters for \nsolution mode, e.g. examining archived filters, or filter analysis by facilities \nlacking clean chemistry laboratories.  As sample throughput is relatively high, \nlaser ablation sampling could also lend itself to reconnaissance or epidemiological \nstudies across large urbanized areas, particularly those that are heavily polluted \nwith high Pb concentrations in the airborne particulates. \n Figure 2 illustrates the Marylebone Road aerosol isotope compositions in the \ncontext of UK urban sites sampled between 1994 and 1998.  The 1994 - 1995 \naerosol compositions of Monna et al. (1997)17 provide baseline data pre-dating the \nfinal period of leaded petrol phasing-out and are plotted with their compilations of \nthe Pb isotope compositions of leaded petrol, pre-industrial natural Pb, and \nestimates of \u201cindustrial\u201d Pb based upon French sources.  The data show a mixing \ntrend in 206Pb\/204Pb - 208Pb\/204Pb space with aerosol Pb\u2019s from various locations \n(London, Southampton) recording un-radiogenic Pb compositions of petrol-\nderived emissions and more radiogenic industrial contributions.  1994 - 1995 \naerosol Pb isotope composition was strongly controlled by petrol contributions, \nwith sample site Pb composition dependant upon proximity to roads with high \ntraffic densities, wind direction (hence potential dilution of traffic sources) and \ntime of sampling (weekend vs weekday variation in traffic densities).  Of interest \nis the large spread of isotope compositions exhibited by the suburban London \nsample site, which is significantly more radiogenic than other sites.  \n UK aerosol Pb isotopic composition had been relatively constant in the ~20 \nyears prior to 1998 leading to the prediction, based on North American data trend, \nthat phasing out leaded petrol should be reflected in a shift in isotopic \ncomposition.14  Such an evolution of aerosol Pb compositions over time is indeed \nrevealed by the data from this study, 1998 Oxford data, and 1994 - 1995 data.14,24  \nLondon 1998 and Oxford 1998 compositions are very similar, presumably \nreflecting a similar balance between traffic-derived Pb and that from other sources. \nLondon 1999 data are sufficiently different from the 1998 data to show that \nphasing out of leaded petrol was well advanced in 1999.  The 2000-2001 data \ncrucially document the final effect of totally removing leaded petrol from the UK \nenvironment.  It is noteworthy that while the 1998 and 1999 data do not overlap, \nthe 2000 and 2001 data completely overlap, and partly overlap with 1999.  The \nsimilarity of the 2000 and 2001 data suggest stabilisation of Pb sources in London \nby this time, with these aerosol compositions approaching but not meeting with \nthe fields of \u201cindustrial\u201d or background geological sources.  This situation could \nresult from a number of factors: [1] recycling of Pb originating from leaded petrol \nadditives residual within the urban environment; [2] presence of a second-order \ntraffic-related Pb source; or [3] a local London \u201cindustrial\u201d isotope signature \ndistinct from the industrial signatures documented in the literature.  While [1] and \n[3] cannot be discounted, research in other urban areas points to [2] as the most \nprobable scenario. Unleaded petrol is known to contain Pb while diesel and its \ncombustion products have very low Pb concentrations.31-32 Furthermore, data from \nShanghai and Paris indicate that vehicles burning unleaded petrol are still \ncontributing to the overall Pb budget in high traffic areas, albeit reduced from \npetrol\u2019s former prominence.32-33 In the light of these observations, it is highly \nprobable that petrol combustion in London is still an important PM10 Pb source, \nand as such, is still a useful tracer of traffic PM10 contributions in general, \nalthough the industrial Pb isotope compositions and scale of Pb recycling is not \nyet characterised for the London environment. Mixing calculations using French \nindustrial Pb compositions17, the Pb composition of unleaded petrol31, and PM10 \ndata from this study indicate that 2000-2001 unleaded petrol-related contributions \nmainly ranges from 26 to 56% (extremes at 13% and 66%) of the Marylebone \nroadside Pb budget (Table 1).   \n Phasing out leaded petrol elsewhere in Western Europe, in cases predating \nphasing out in the UK, resulted in parallel aerosol Pb isotope evolution towards \nmore radiogenic compositions up to the time of complete elimination of leaded \npetrol.  This evolution is well characterised for PM10 in France15-17,32, and the \nsimilarity of the London data to measurements from Paris is particularly striking \n(Figure 2).  Such a convergence of isotope compositions indicates very similar \nprimary controls on the isotope composition of pollution sources.  In addition, \nParis and London now share similar proportions of traffic-related Pb in the total \naerosol budget (c.f. traffic related Pb 30-50% of total Pb for Paris aerosols32) and \nthe increased variability of aerosol composition on a day to day basis.15,32 \n The reduction in Pb compositional differences between UK aerosol sources, \ncoupled with continuing reduction of Pb levels in the environment will inevitably \nresult in previously subordinate sources of Pb having a greater impact on the \naerosol Pb budget.  In many places such sources are not yet well studied but will \nneed characterisation in order to understand isotopically variable and complex \nlocal environments.  It is also likely that distal transport of Pb from relatively \nhigh-Pb environments will increasingly impact on the local UK Pb aerosol \ncomposition, following the trend observed in Germany14, where long-term Pb \nreduction in the environment has made it possible to observe the affects of Russian \nand Eastern European Pb.  At the same time it will be progressively more \nchallenging with the sampling protocols used here to analyse all of the Pb isotopes \non samples collected over \u226424 hour periods, a desirable timescale for considering \nthe affects of local meteorological conditions and disparate Pb sources.  \nMulticollector Faraday measurements are presently capable of satisfying the \nanalytical constraints given the high sensitivity of state of the art MC-ICP-MS, but \nin future multiple ion counting capability now available for the latest generation \nMC-ICP-MS instruments, or high sensitivity SF-ICP-MS with ion counting \ndetectors, may be required to study short timescale aerosol compositional \nvariations. \nUConclusions \nPb isotope compositions for London UK PM10 atmospheric particulates were \nmeasured by solution-mode MC-ICP-MS for samples collected at intervals \nbetween 1998 and 2001, and show a dramatic shift to increasingly radiogenic \ncompositions over time.  This relates directly to the final phasing out of leaded \npetrol in the UK.  The similarity of 2000 and 2001 data suggest that the Pb isotope \ncomposition in London had stablized, providing a useful baseline for continuing \nUK PM10 monitoring studies through the 21st century. \n The observed Pb isotope evolution trend parallels that of other regions that \nphased out leaded petrol, with 2000 - 2001 London and 2002 Paris aerosol isotope \ncompositions being particularly similar. In London, traffic-related Pb \ncontributions to PM10 are still important, but other Pb sources are becoming \nincreasingly prominent.  Continuing UK PM10 Pb isotope investigation is \nwarranted as there are contributing factors that either are poorly quantified or \nsubject to change. Accurate source apportionment between traffic-related and \nother local and distal Pb sources is currently precuded and it is a prequisite that \nbetter constraints on the local anthropogenic sources are obtained, as this will \nfacilitate distal source assessment. \n Lastly, a pilot investigation of LA-MC-ICP-MS showed that although the level \nof precision achieved does not match that of the more established techniques, the \ndata are sufficiently accurate and precise to show the main Pb isotope trends in our \nstudy area. Some advantages of the method include low Pb blank and by-passing \nof chemical separation of Pb, which could facilitate aerosol studies in analytical \nfacilities lacking the clean laboratory conditions or where reconnaisance level data \nis required. \n \nUReferences \n1 J.O.
