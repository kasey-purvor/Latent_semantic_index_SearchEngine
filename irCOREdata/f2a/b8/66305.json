However, weak interactions also\nmean that it can be difficult to achieve sufficiently strong\nconfinement, characterized by a high trap oscillation fre-\nquency \u0001trap, for fast gate operations. For optical traps,\n1,2\nincreasing \u0001trap is restricted by the simultaneous demand of\nminimizing spontaneous scattering. For magnetic traps, there\nis no such restriction and very high \u0001trap could be used with-\nout introducing additional decoherence. In practice, achiev-\ning high \u0001trap requires miniaturization of the magnetic trap\ncomponents. Magnetic microtraps based on current carrying\nwires3,4 have been very successful but some problems remain\nto be solved, such as \u201cspin flips\u201d induced by Johnson noise\nin wires,5,6 and trapping potential variations due to current\ninhomogeneities along the wire.7\u201310 Considerable progress\nhas also been made using ferromagnetic recording media11,12\nto allow reconfigurable traps. Here, we propose an atom trap\ncreated above mobile domain walls in planar magnetic nano-\nwires. As complex nanowire patterns can be fabricated on\ntransparent substrates, domain wall atom traps provide a\nunique combination of high trap frequencies \u0001\u00021 MHz;\ncomparable to those in ion traps13\u0002, controlled transport,\nsingle qubit addressability, state-selective entanglement, and\nlow decoherence. The position of domain walls in two-\ndimensional \u00012D\u0002 magnetic nanowire circuits can be con-\ntrolled under moderate in-plane magnetic fields.14\u201316 So\nmagnetic nanowire networks could be fabricated with re-\ngions where neighboring traps are sufficiently far apart to\nallow individual laser addressing, and other regions where\ntraps are brought closer together to implement state-selective\noptically induced interactions.\nHere, we consider Ni81Fe19 \u0001Permalloy\u0002 nanowires of\nthickness t=5 nm and width w=200 nm, similar to those\nused in previous studies.16\u201319 These nanowires are magne-\ntized along their length and have transverse domain walls.20\nThe minimum energy state of a simple, straight nanowire\ncomprises a single magnetic domain. However, domain walls\ncan be controllably introduced to magnetic nanowires17,21,22\nand separate regions of opposite magnetization. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002\nshows the calculated equilibrium state structure of a \u201chead-\nto-head\u201d transverse domain wall with no applied magnetic\nfield. A nanowire structure is discretized into tetrahedral el-\nements, and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion\nand quasistatic Maxwell equations were solved using a finite\nelement\/boundary element method.23 The domain wall stray\nfield Bdw is calculated analytically from equivalent dipole\ncharges on the nanowire surface to obtain high accuracy.24\nThe pitch of the stray field mesh above the nanowire is either\n10 or 1 nm, depending on the spatial precision required.\nIn the region directly above the domain wall, Bdw is\ndominated by the z component Bdwz .

For the\ncase of domain wall stray field only, \u0005Bdw\u0005 decreases with\ndistance above the nanowire \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004, and an atom would\nbe repelled from the domain wall. However, if a uniform\nout-of-plane magnetic field Bdc is also applied to the system,\nBdw\nz will be exactly compensated over a three-dimensional\n\u00013D\u0002 surface above the domain wall. A point will exist on\nthis surface, and close to the x=y=0 line, where the x and y\ncomponents of magnetic field are also zero, so that the field\nmagnitude minimum \u0005B\u0005min=0 \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. However, \u0005B\u0005min\n\u00020 is required in order to preserve the low-field-seeking\nangular momentum atomic state. This can be achieved by\nadditionally applying a rotating magnetic field of amplitude\nBac, as in a conventional time-orbiting potential trap.25,26 Pro-\nvided the frequency of the rotating field exceeds \u0001trap but is\nless than the Larmor precession frequency \u0001L=\u0003B\u0005B\u0005min\/h,\ntrapped atoms will respond to the time averaged field modu-\nlus. Then, \u0005B\u0005min=Bac, \u0005B\u0005= \u0005Bdc\u0005 at long distances from the\ndomain wall, and so the trap depth, Btrap= \u0005Bdc\u0005\u2212Bac \u0003Fig.\n1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. This also requires that for a particular trap height, Bac\nmust be above a critical value to ensure that \u0001L\u0002\u0001trap. The\ndomain wall trap is analogous to the atom traps formed\nabove current carrying wires3 except that for the domain wall\ncase, the trap is zero-dimensional \u00010D\u0002 rather than quasi-one-\ndimensioinal \u0001quasi-1D\u0002. The external fields required to cre-\nate a field minimum at reasonable distances from the domain\nwall are relatively small \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. For instance, for a 87Rb\natom with angular momentum quantum numbers F=2 and\nmF= +2, applying Bdc=\u22126.1 G and Bac=1 G will create a\nfield minimum at a height z0=500 nm with a trap depth\nequivalent to a temperature of 340 \u0003K. The spin-flip loss\nrate calculated from the ratio of the spin-flip energy\n\u00012\u0003B\u0005B\u0005min\u0002 to the vibrational energy27 is negligibly small for\nthe above parameters. Thermal fluctuations in metallic films\nclose to trapped atoms can also cause spin relaxation.28 We\ncalculate that this effect will limit the lifetime of a trap with\nz0=500 nm and \u0001trap=1 MHz above the nanowire considered\nhere to \u000620 s. In this case, the trap lifetime would become\nlimited by the quality of the operating vacuum.\nThe trap frequency for each dimension as a function of\nthe trap height is shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 for Bac=1 G. For z0\n=500 nm, \u0001x=\u0001y\u0006110 kHz, and \u0001z=320 kHz, giving a\nmean trap frequency, \u0001\u00af= \u0001\u0001x\u0001y\u0001z\u00021\/3=160 kHz. For z0\n=250 nm, \u0001\u00af increases to 1.2 MHz, significantly higher than\ncan be achieved in other atom systems, while Bac must in-\ncrease to 2 G to ensure \u0001L\u0002\u0001\u00af. \u0001\u00af can be increased further by\nincreasing the nanowire cross-sectional area, although this\nwill eventually change the domain wall structure into a\nvortex,20 altering the position of \u0005B\u0005min.\nOne benefit of the geometry used here is that a single\nbias field plus a rotating field will create the necessary trap\nconditions throughout a 2D nanowire network, independent\nof in-plane wire direction. However, if QIP is to be achieved\nwith an array of domain wall atom traps, additional in-plane\nfields are required to propagate the domain walls through the\nnanowires. These fields shift the position of atom traps rela-\ntive to domain walls. For example, with no in-plane quasi-\nstatic field and Bdc=\u221220 G, the trap position \u0001x ,y ,z\u0002 is\n\u00010,70,280\u0002 nm. With the addition of a field, Bappx =20G in\nthe x direction, the trap moves to \u0001\u2212170,70,170\u0002 nm. Alter-\nnatively, if Bapp\nx is removed and replaced by the transverse\nfield Bappy =20 G in the y direction, the trap is located at \u00010,\n\u2212100,170\u0002 nm. With an additional in-plane field Bapp in ei-\nther the x or y direction, the trap depth increases to Btrap\n= \u0001Bdc\n2 +Bapp\n2 \u00021\/2\u2212Bac, so for the above conditions, Bapp in-\ncreases the trap depth from 1.3 to 1.8 mK. This is accompa-\nnied by a doubling of \u0001\u00af. These calculations simplify the ex-\nperimental situation by assuming that the domain wall\nstructure remains unaffected by the externally applied fields.\nThe finite depth of the domain wall atom traps places an\nupper limit on trap and domain wall acceleration before\ntrapped atoms are lost. For parameters corresponding to Fig.\n1, the maximum acceleration is 6.4\u0004104m s\u22122. Domain\nwalls propagating under steady-state conditions typically ac-\ncelerate to their drift velocity in \u00061 ns.29 However, the ac-\nceleration experienced by a trapped atom will be averaged\nover the trap period, so for megahertz trap frequencies the\ndomain wall drift velocities will be limited to a few cm s\u22121.\nAverage domain wall velocities of 0.01 m s\u22121 have been\nmeasured19 in a nanowire similar to that considered here.\nThis velocity might be reduced further by introducing peri-\nodic defects in the wire edges. This has been demonstrated\npreviously using ultrathin nanowires with out-of-plane mag-\nnetization to reliably lower domain wall velocities by two\norders of magnitude.30\nIn order to extend this concept of a domain wall atom\ntrap to a vehicle for QIP, single qubit rotations of individual\natoms in separate traps and state-selective interactions be-\ntween atoms in neighboring traps are required. Figure 3 il-\nlustrates a nanowire network of isolated 2D nanowires that is\ndesigned to perform both qubit rotations and interactions.\nTwo network \u201ctiles\u201d are shown that can be tessellated to\ncreate networks for large numbers of qubits. Domain walls\ncan be introduced to the nanowires with magnetically soft\n\u201cinjection pads\u201d21,22 and propagated through the individual\nnanowires using an appropriate sequence of in-plane mag-\nnetic fields. The central region of the tiles has curved track\nsections of two different radii so that domain walls in adja-\ncent tracks will come into close proximity under a field ap-\nplied in the y direction \u0001Fig. 3\u0002. This allows accurate control\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 Required applied field bias as a function of trap height above\nnanowire. \u0001b\u0002 Frequency of the domain wall atom trap in the x \u0001\u0002\u0002, y \u0001\u0001\u0002,\nand z \u0001\u0001\u0002 directions for a 87Rb atom in the F=2, mF=2 state as a function\nof trap height.

Due to the alternating curve radius of the nanowire\ntracks, any number of qubits can in principle undergo com-\nplete interaction given a sufficient number of tile tessella-\ntions. Atoms are loaded into a 1D array of domain wall traps\nusing a large period optical lattice \u0001far left of Fig. 3\u0002 and\ninitialized in a sequence of 0\u2019s, 1\u2019s, or superposition states\nusing stimulated Raman transitions. When the qubits are\nbrought close to their neighbors in the central tile regions,\nstate-selective coupling between channels can be imple-\nmented either using cavity quantum electrodynamics31\n\u0001QED\u0002 or the dipole-blockade mechanism.32 Following this,\natoms can be moved to the next tile or back to their initial\nposition to perform additional rotations or readout. Combin-\ning these operations it is straightforward to realize a univer-\nsal gate: for example, a Hadamard rotation on channel 1\ncould create a superposition state, and channel 2 initialized\nin state \u00050\u0007 or \u00051\u0007 as required. In the center of a tile, the\ncoupling field introduces a phase shift to the superposition\nstate in channel 1 that is conditional on the state in channel 2.\nFinally, when the atoms reach the other side of the tile, a\nsecond Hadamard operation on channel 1 completes a con-\ntrolled NOT operation.\nThis example scheme is not without its uncertainties. For\nexample, we have not yet considered how bringing two do-\nmain walls together will be affected by their structure or how\ntheir proximity will affect the trapping of two atoms. An\nalternative scheme in which atoms are brought together at\nnanowire junctions similar to those used in domain wall\nlogic16 would initially appear attractive. However, previous\nwork33 suggests that two domain walls join together when\npropagating across a junction, which could result in the ejec-\ntion of one of the trapped atoms.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that field minima pro-\nduced above domain walls in magnetic nanowires provide a\ncombination of tight atom confinement with controlled mo-\ntion making this a promising system for QIP.\nThe authors thank E.

The two dotted square tiles each contain a\ndesign of magnetic nanowires that may be tessellated to create larger struc-\ntures with full interaction between a large number of atom traps. The dotted\ncircles are example regions of where optically induced Hadamard operations\n\u0001H\u0002 or atomic interactions \u0001A\u0002 may be performed.\n014102-3 Allwood et al. Appl. Phys.
