Each wave shows a nested phase of \nenthusiasm and of scepticism. During the first wave biological news has little salience \nand evaluation parallels the attitudes to general science. During the second wave \ngenetic engineering becomes a major news item, and its phase of evaluation separates \nfrom that of general science and technology. While general science improves its \npublic profile, biotechnology becomes publicly controversial during the 1990s. Public \nperceptions, as far as data is available, follows the changing trends of the press with \nsome lag. For both waves of public sentiment the paper highlights events and topics \nthat fuelled public imagination and that led to the present mix of controversies over \ngenetic technology in food production, biomedicine and law enforcement. The \nwatershed events of 1996 (gm soya) and 1997 (Dolly the sheep) did not initiate the \ntrend changes which started already in mid 1980s, but catalysed an already \nestablished trend towards more sceptical sentiments in the late 1990s.    \n \nKeywords: social representation, long-term trends in public opinion, media \nmonitoring, DNA, genetics, biotechnology.  \n \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 2\n  New Genetics and Society \nOpinion polls and studies of public sentiments towards genetic research in all its \nmodes and applications abound, but only in recent year when public controversy has \nbecome apparent. Long-term continuous data streams on public opinion and public \nsentiment on anything is generally hard to come by. Outside voting intentions, the \nlabour market, fear of crime, and the consumer climate, the social sciences have few \nestablished \u2018weather stations\u2019 that take readings of public sentiments comparable to \nthe innumerous readings of temperature, humidity and wind speed that go into \nweather forecasts. The rule seems to be: no controversy, no opinion poll. For the long-\nterm study of public sentiments towards genetic research we suffer exactly that \nshortage of readings, but we may be able to compensate the handicap by resorting to \nlongitudinal analysis of newsprint. The present paper analyses the trajectory of \ngenetics in the British press between 1946 and 2002. The paper makes several \nconceptual, substantive and methodological points.  \n \n \nRepresentation matters \n \nDespite post-modern ruminations of a \u2018crisis of representation\u2019, the presumption of \nthis paper is that representation of biotechnology matters. \u2018Representation\u2019 has \nhowever several meanings. First, it means to speak on behalf of somebody, either in \ncourt for a client or in parliament for a constituency. Secondly, it means to collect \ndata from a population in a unbiased manner ensuring that each member has the same \nchance of being selected (this meaning is part of our methodology, see below). And \nfinally it refers to re-presenting something that is absent with semiotic tools such as \niconic images, indexical markers, or word symbols, expressions or stories. And absent \nmeans being presently at a different location or a matter of imagination, or having had \na past existence, or having a future as a not-yet-being. Representations thus \naccommodate reality and are a potential space, past and future. I will use the term \n\u2018representation\u2019 mainly in the latter semiotic sense. Furthermore, representations are \nno private matter, but communicated among people. They are the resources we all use \nto make sense of the world and world events (see Wagner & Hayes, 2005; \nJovchelovitch, 1996; Farr & Moscovici, 1984). Hence, representations of \nbiotechnology, the focus of this paper, are not epiphenomena of a techno-political \nfait-accompli, but they are an integral part of the public sphere that, by focusing \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 3\n  New Genetics and Society \nattention, motivate and legitimate or question and resist this new technology (Bauer & \nGaskell, 1999). A convenient data stream, albeit not the only one, for the \nreconstruction of representations is mass media reportage. A key problems is how \nrepresentations come about, are sustained, and change over time in any public forum. \nRepresentations of any public issue are sponsored and contested by social actors, and \nin this contest we like to think of an emerging technology as a quasi-social movement \nthat competes for public attention and thus enhances or shortens its future (see Bauer, \n2002b; Bauer & Gaskell, 2000).  \n \nThe analysis of media representations is complicated by the double nature of mass \nmediation: expression of public opinion on one hand, and lever of social influence on \nthe other. Mass media are both means and mediator. Our daily news in Britain is in a \nclassical sense public opinion. It is the expression of a constitutionally protected \nfreedom of speech about matters of common interest in a competitive market of \nopinions.i But news and reportage is also influential in setting the agenda and framing \nthe public opinion process: thus they are means to tell the people what to think about, \nand how to think about matters public. The mass media are the targets of strategic \ncontrols and thus prone to explicit and implicit bias.  \n \nContent analysis of news makes two contributions. First, it shows what many actors \nwere perceiving, or at least were able to, as public opinion at the time. Politicians, \nbusiness people, civil servants and scientists attend to newsprint and thus encounter \npublic opinion. For many the news is a marker of public opinion. This opinion is \nselected and elaborated by the daily practices of journalists and news production in a \ncompetitive market for audience attention (Hansen, 1993). It is like an exhibit in the \nLondon Tate Modern gallery: it reflects a mixture of ethos and the commercial and \ncultural sense for a good story. After all, newsprint responds to a readers\u2019 market of \nattention; what is of no interest, does not sell; hence over time we expect, the stories \nthat sell reflect the reader mentality by way of accommodation. Media analysis offers \nan index of \u2018opinion in public\u2019, while an individual reader may privately very well \nhave ignored, agreed or disagreed with its contents. Secondly, the mass media \ncirculate images and arguments and insinuate to the readers what to opine about. For \nmany social actors, strategically intent upon setting the agenda on an issue such as \nbiotechnology, media coverage is instrumental: to frame public discussions, to \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 4\n  New Genetics and Society \ncultivate certain views, and to persuade the public to support a certain course of \naction. In the long run, news coverage and reportage will, by way of simple \nredundancy, cultivate particular public views, thus create, stimulate or caution \nexpectations of things to come. Mass media analysis offers therefore early indicators \nof public opinion in the making, albeit with a exaggerated amplitude. For example, \n\u2018sexing up\u2019 is part and parcel of preparing the ground for new technology. There is \nmethod in hype and the modernist bias for innovation: \u2018revolutionary\u2019 innovations \nneed the attention of funding agencies, venture capital and the young. Some occasions \ndemand more moderate claims making and reassurance that nothing is in the making \nthat might require new regulation and laws.ii Contradictory rhetoric comes with new \ntechnology, as different audiences need to be pleased.   \n \nThus, by looking over the shoulders of past newspaper readers, we can gauge how \ngenetics was mirrored in society at different periods in time, and this, because \nindependent of the polling industry, not only in times of controversy. This mirror, \nbecause of its double nature, however, is neither plain nor plane.  \n \nThe public sphere, topic salience and framing \n \nNews is a dramatic narrative centred on events, actions, persons and a moral point \n(Schudson, 2003; Burke, 1945). Equally, science news offers the reader a \npersonalised drama in and around science and technology. This idea of \u2018drama\u2019 has \nseveral implications. Firstly, it avoids the expectation that news reportage is \nisomorphic to scientific activities and is therefore to be judged by its \u2018accuracy\u2019. To \nthe contrary science news as dramatic representation of science is to be judged by its \nrules of operation: the selection and elaboration of events according to news values, \nand by its contribution to the formation of public opinion (Neidhardt, 1993). \nRepresentations of science in newsprint are contributions in and for the public sphere, \nneither primarily true nor false, nor irrelevant, nor educational, nor entertaining. News \nforemost dramatises events to synchronise and modulate public attention, provides \nframes of interpretation and stimulates everyday conversations (Bauer & Gaskell, \n1999).   \n \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 5\n  New Genetics and Society \nWe distinguish public opinion from the public sphere on the one hand, and from \nopinion measurements on the other; three distinct but related concepts. The public \nsphere is an historical structure of forums where reasonable opinion emerge on \nmatters of general concern, subject to the constraints of a ideal of free speech \n(Habermas, 1989). The public sphere requires constant vigilance against tendencies of \ndecline. Within a public sphere, public opinion is a process that can be studied by its \noutcomes, classically a vote or an opinion poll. However, it is important to avoid the \nfallacy of operationalism and define public opinion by what public opinion polls \nmeasure. I research \u2018public opinion\u2019 as covariance of mass media contents and public \nperceptions over time. Like other measures, once visualised, they offer \u2018movable \nimmobiles\u2019 of otherwise intangible phenomena. Secondly, the notion of drama \nfocuses attention to the stage setting and the plot. The setting opens space, and the \nplot links acts and actors into complications and offers a moral. Here I consider two \nelements of such drama: the space given to and the evaluation of the act of \u2018genetics\u2019.  \n \n \nMethodology \n \nThe long-term trends of the press coverage are reconstructed from two research \ndatabases of British media coverage. Weiii consider the number of articles in a single \nnewspaper as indicator of public salience and the mean evaluation of genetics and \nbiotechnology across the articles as an index of public attitudes. Our method is \ncontent analysis (e.g. Bauer, 2000; Krippendorff, 1980). With two simple indicators \nwe characterise the unfolding public drama of genetics over the past 50 years. The \nvalue of this procedure is the simplicity and ease with which longitudinal data streams \ncan be constructed. If public opinion is a process, then its faithful representation must \nat least be a dynamic picture.  \n \n \nData for the period 1946-73 \n \nThe database \u2018Science and Technology in the British Press, 1946-92\u2019 comprises \nnewspaper articles dating from 1946 to 1992 (see Bauer et al., 1995). The corpus is a \nprobability sample of press articles, stratified by year and newspaper including the \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 6\n  New Genetics and Society \nDaily Telegraphy, Daily Mirror, Daily Times, Daily Express, and the Guardian. The \nstudy coded scientific and technology themes (Q36 and Q37), for our purposes we \nselected the materials on biology or genetics. \u2018Biotechnology\u2019 was not a term in \npublic discussions before the 1980s. Intensity scores are estimated based on the \nsample and weighted to a single source basis; the bi-annual scores are interpolated for \nthe missing years. The \u2018evaluation\u2019 of the scientific event is rated for each article \n(code Q18) between 1 (= discourse of great promise) and  5 (= discourse of great \nconcern). These ratings are recoded so that the neutral position is 0 (-2 to +2). Note \nthat on average the pre-1973 evaluation of genetics is slightly on the negative side \n(mean = -0.15; std dev = 0.24; n=165). Annual mean scores are a reliable index of the \nchanging evaluation of \u2018genetics\u2019 between 1946 and 1972. Inter-coder reliability of \nthis process is 0.87.  \n \nData for the period 1973-99 \n \nThe international project  \u2018Biotechnology and the Public\u2019 conducted press monitoring \nof biotechnology news in the elite press for the period between 1973 and 2002 (see \nDurant, Bauer & Gaskell, 1998; Bauer & Howard, 2004). Salience figures are based \non a single source outlet (UK: Times until 1987; Independent after 1987); until the \nmid 1980s figures are based on Times Index entries. In later years we have access to \non-line resources and used the search keywords \u2018genes\u2019, \u2018biotechnology\u2019, \u2018cloning\u2019 or \n\u2018DNA\u2019. We enumerate all references. Comparisons of different news outlets show a \nhigh annual correlation of topic salience, because of strong competition in the \nnewspaper market. This suggests that a single source is a good enough long-term \nindicator. The content coding is based on an annually stratified random sample of \narticles. The \u2018evaluation of biotechnology\u2019 is based on two scales, a negative (Q23a: 0 \n= not applicable; 1= slightly negative; 5 = discourse of great concern) and positive \nrating (Q23b: 0 not applicable; 1= slightly positive; 5 = discourse of great promise). \nThe evaluation index is defined as the difference of positive and negative ratings. \nNote that on average the post-1973 ratings are positive (mean =  1.09; std dev = 1.90; \nn= 802).  \n \nWe consider these ratings functionally equivalent before and after 1973. For purposes \nof analysing long-term trends we calibrate the two series. The overlap of the two data \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 7\n  New Genetics and Society \nseries from 1974 to 1992 helps to validate both intensity and valuation figures in the \ntwo series. We standardize the evaluation scores in both data series to their long-term \naverage. The graphics below show the annual deviations from the long-term average \n(mean = 0, std dev = 1). The standard score of 1972 is slightly lower than that 1974; \nto link the two time-series we raise the pre-1973 series by adding a correction of \n(+)0.2 to standard score. This avoids the wrong impression of a \u2018sudden jump\u2019 in \n1972-74, which is likely an artefact of using different measures.  \n \nPublic perceptions: being optimistic about biotechnology  \n \nThe optimism index is based on the UK data of Eurobarometer, an instrument of the \nEuropean Commission to monitor opinions across European member states. Each data \npoint corresponds to a representative survey of the UK population with a sample of \nn=1300 face-to-face interviews (Britain and Northern Ireland). This instrument \nmeasured public attitudes to science and technology in general (EB 10a of 1978) or to \nbiotechnology in particular (EB 35.1 of 1991; 39.1 of 1993, 46.1 of 1996, 52.1 of \n1999, 58 of 2002). One item serves here as a comparable index of \u2018general optimism\u2019 \nabout biotechnology and genetic engineering. In 1978, The British and other \nEuropeans were asked: 'do you think that the transmission of hereditary \ncharacteristics which could make it possible to improve the qualities of living species \nis worthwhile' (or of no particular interest, or an unacceptable risk). On later \noccasions the equivalent question reads 'do you think biotechnology will improve our \nway of life in the next 20 years' (or has no effect, or will make things worse, or don\u2019t \nknow). We report the percentage of \u2018optimistic attitudes\u2019 reflected in answering \n\u2018worthwhile\u2019 (in 1978) and \u2018will improve\u2019 (from 1991 to 2002). All reported \npercentages have a maximal margin of error of (-\/+) 3% at 95% confidence level.  \n \n \nThe Path of Genetics in British Public Opinion \n \nFigure 1 shows the salience and the evaluation of genetics\/biotechnology in Britain \nover a 55-year period. The graphic shows the take-off of biology news, mainly \nbiotechnology and genetic engineering news from the mid-1980s onwards. By 1999 \nwe find over 1600 references to \u2018genes\u2019, or 4 to 5 per day, in a single British national \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 8\n  New Genetics and Society \nquality newspaper.iv In the 1950s or 1960s, gene news was a monthly event at best. \nClearly the British public gives sizable attention to this topic the second half of the \n1990s. \n  \nSalience and evaluation of genetics and biotechnology in the British Quality Press\n0.00\n10.00\n20.00\n30.00\n40.00\n50.00\n60.00\n70.00\n80.00\n90.00\n100.00\n19\n46\n19\n48\n19\n50\n19\n52\n19\n54\n19\n56\n19\n58\n19\n60\n19\n62\n19\n64\n19\n66\n19\n68\n19\n70\n19\n72\n19\n74\n19\n76\n19\n78\n19\n80\n19\n82\n19\n84\n19\n86\n19\n88\n19\n90\n19\n92\n19\n94\n19\n96\n19\n98\n20\n00\n20\n02\nno\n o\nf a\nrt\nic\nle\ns \n[1\n99\n9=\n10\n0:\n 1\n66\n6 \nar\ntic\nle\ns]\n-1.20\n-1.00\n-0.80\n-0.60\n-0.40\n-0.20\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\n1.20\nde\nvi\nat\nio\nn \nfr\nom\n m\nea\nn\nSalience\nUKeval-std\n \nFigure 1 shows the salience and evaluation of genetics and biotechnology \nnews between 1946 and 2002 in the British quality press. The index of salience \nis 100 = 1999 representing a count of 1666 different references to \nbiotechnology in a single source. The evaluation index shows the deviations \nfrom the long-term average. The evaluation is based on annual average \nratings of articles as \u2018discourse of promise\u2019 (high values) or \u2018discourse of \nconcern\u2019 (low values). Ratings are standardised and calibrated to the long-\nterm trends before and after 1973. The smooth lines show 6-year moving \naverages.  \n \nThe picture shows two waves of growing and declining enthusiasm for genetics. Until \n1960 the evaluation of genetics is ever more positive to turn more negative in the \nearly 1970s. Then again until 1981 the news is ever more positive, only to reverse \nafter the mid 1980s and into the 1990s. As biotechnology news expands, the discourse \nbecomes more varied and more sceptical (note: the graphs denote deviations from the \nlong-term mean and not the level of evaluation). However, despite these trend \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 9\n  New Genetics and Society \nchanges and contrary to polemical perceptions of media coverage, the attitude of the \nBritish press stays positive (see Bauer et al., 1998). Both indicators, salience and \nevaluation, suggest two phases of news on genetics and biotechnology: a first period \nfrom 1946 to the early 1970s, and a second period from the early 1970s to the end of \nthe century and probably beyond, each period with a phase of enthusiasm. The mid \n1970s are indeed the beginnings of what became known as \u2018new biotechnology\u2019 based \non recombinant DNA techniques and direct interventions at the level of the gene. This \nis contrasted to \u2018old biotechnology\u2019 that intervenes, and has indeed done so for \ncenturies, at the level of the cell with techniques such as fermentation or animal \nhusbandry. Whether this was a \u2018revolutionary\u2019 watershed or not is still the sticky point \nof regulatory debates, and the key to the \u2018transatlantic gap\u2019 in the 1990s. Whether the \nproduction of transgenic farm animals can and should be regulated under the same \nrubric as age-old cheese making hinges on how this development is construed: \nprocess or product (Jasanoff, 2005).  \n \nHow does the path of biotechnology compare to that of science in general (see Bauer, \n2000; Bauer et al. 2006a). Over the post-war period the biomedical sciences (biology, \nmedicine) displace the physical sciences (physics, geology, chemistry, astronomy) in \npublic attention. Science reporting moves from the \u2018rocket-scalpel\u2019 to the \u2018gene-\nmeteorite\u2019 complex (Bauer, 1998). At the peak of science news in 1962, the physical \nsciences carry the big stories: nuclear power, \u2018big bang\u2019 and space explorations. The \nsalience of genetics is insignificant and hardly affected by the Sputnik shock of \nOctober 1957 (our index shows a small increase in coverage between 1959 and 1961, \nwhich is however insignificant in the general surge of science news at the time). Its \ndiscourse of evaluation converges with that of general science: increased enthusiasm \ninto the 1960s, declining into the 1970s. The 1970s sees much science-sceptical and \nanti-technological public sentiments. The rising salience of biotechnology since mid \n1980s is the new wave of science news. By the 1990s, biotechnology has become \nmajor news. However, the trend in the evaluation of biotechnology diverges from that \nof other sciences. British enthusiasm for science and technology recovers through the \n1980s and into the 1990s. While for genetic engineering enthusiasm decreases after its \npeak in 1981-1984. This public scepticism is specific to biotechnology and is not \ngeneralised to all science and technology as in the 1970s, when this was a matter of \npublic alarm. The personal computer, astronomy and environmental research \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 10\n  New Genetics and Society \ncommand public fascination during this wave of science news. Streams of news of the \nPersonal Computer (PC) in the 1980s and of the internet in the 1990s, had no limits, \nuntil in April\/Mai 2000, the bubble burst and the stock market slumped into a major \ncrisis. In hindsight much of this discourse was hyperbole but functional. In the 1990s \nObservers started to appreciate the significance and the persistence of exaggerated \nnews as a driver of future expectations that enable new technologies.v Hype is not \nexplained by the \u2018enthusiastic bias\u2019 of a handful of science writers.  \n \nIn summary, the first decline in enthusiasm for \u2018genetics\u2019 in the 1960s parallels that \nfor general science with sceptical public sentiments rising in the late 1960s and early \n1970s. This sentiment is fuelled by self-criticisms emanating from scientific circles \nthemselves. The second reversal of attitudes in the 1980s and 1990s is specific to \ngenetic engineering and does not extend to other sciences; except maybe to nuclear \npower that continues to stay far from public grace. The evaluation of genetics \nseparates from that of others sciences. A closer look at each period is revealing.  \n \nBefore 1973: the discovery phase in scientific mode     \n \nBefore 1972 is the phase of scientific discovery in genetics. In hind-sight, the key \nevent was the presentation of the double helix model of DNA of Watson and Crick at \nCambridge University in 1953 (Nobel Prize with Maurice Wilkins in 1962). Figure 2 \nshows increased coverage of biology in the British press in 1952 and 1953, but the \n\u2018double helix\u2019 had little echo at the time. It took weeks until the first isolated news \nreports of the helix model appeared (see Turney, 1998, p135), there is no Nobel effect \nin 1962. Its historic significance is a re-construction of the late 1960s, centred around \nWatson\u2019s controversial account of the discovery and the now famous photo of the \nthree dimensional helix model (Chadarevian, 2003), and of the 50-year celebrations in \n2003.  \n \nIn those days, most science news is in celebratory summaries of papers published in \nNature and Science. Such news coverage tends to increase the public awareness of \nresearch and the citation counts of the authors by up to 70% over the next 10 years \n(see Philips, 1991). With an average of one article per month genetics news is \ninsignificant compared to that of the physical sciences and to what will become the \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 11\n  New Genetics and Society \nlevel of genetics news in the 1990s. Science news, and there is increasing amounts in \nthe late 1950s and early 1960s, focuses on atom bombs and, after the Geneva \u2018Atoms \nfor Peace\u2019 conference of 1955, increasingly on civil nuclear power and its potentials. \nBritain is a major player, linked the world\u2019s first civil nuclear power station to the \nelectricity grid in 1956 (Calder Hall) and enjoys the \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US \nbased on their joint nuclear capability. Genetics remains marginal news, but at times \nits surfs the news issue with stories on nuclear fallout and the risks of genetic \nmutations at various levels of radiation exposure (see Weart, 1988, 200ff).  \n \nSalience and evaluation, 1946-73\nR2 = 0.44\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72\nno\n o\nf a\nrt\nic\nle\ns\n-0.60\n-0.40\n-0.20\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\nde\nvi\nat\nio\nn \nfr\nom\n m\nea\nn\nsalience\nEval-std\n \nFigure 2 shows the trends for salience and evaluation of biology in the news \nduring the period 1946 to 1972. The dashed line indicates a linear trend for \nsalience with a fit of R2 = 0.44. The counts are numbers of articles per year in \na single newspaper source, interpolated for every second year. The index of \nevaluation shows deviations from the long-term slightly negative average \n(mean evaluation =  - 0.15). Low numbers mean lower than average \nevaluation, high numbers mean higher than average evaluation. The smooth \nline is a moving 4-year average of evaluation.   \n \nGenetic and biology news increases in the early 1960s, reflecting the expansion of \nmedical and clinical genetics and the controversial continuity of pre-war eugenics \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 12\n  New Genetics and Society \n(Kevles, 1995). The conference \u2018Man and His Future\u2019 of 1963 features Julian Huxley, \nfounder of the WWF and former director of UNESCO, linking eugenic ideas and \nnuclear fallout. He argues that to halt human genetic deterioration from radioactive \nfallout mankind urgently needs to freeze stocks of sperms of healthy and intelligent \nmales for later use (see Thom & Jennings, 1996, 227). The British Eugenics Society \ntries to stem decline and changes its name to the Galton Foundation in 1969. The \nburgeoning of genetic research leads to the identification of gene anomalies \nassociated with syndromes such as Down\u2019s and Turner, and controversially links the \nlatter to samples from convicted criminals in prison. In 1969, a London Hospital \nbegins offering pre-natal diagnosis of Down\u2019s syndrome using amniocentesis, by \n1972 35 clinics will have followed suit. These events are public news.   \n \nThe revival of eugenic ideas does not come without challenge considering its \nnotorious past in Europe and North America (Koch, 2004). The low-key post-war \nenthusiasm for a \u2018genetic revolution\u2019 led by British science and anticipating the idea \nof gene mapping reverses in the early 1960s towards a more sceptical note into the \n1970s. Scientific issues are taken up by the student movements of 1968-69 \nculminating in the controversies over intelligence and \u2018Sociobiology\u2019 in mid 1970s. A \nstrong controversy over nature-nurture in human development, spilling over from the \nUS, bestows notoriety to British psychologists Burt and Eysenck by the end of the \n1970s (see Gould, 1996). Note, that these are also the beginnings of the challenge to \nthe neo-positivist and Mertonian canons in the philosophy and sociology of science.      \n \n \nAfter 1973: the business phase in industrial mode \n \nThe year 1973 is a watershed year for genetic engineering. Herbert W Boyer & \nStanley Cohen of Stanford University, building on previous work by Paul Berg and by \nAnnie Chang, secure a patent on their method of recombining DNA. This opens the \nnew era of biotechnology with the prospect of a \u2018genetic gold rush\u2019: the commercial \nexploitation of design at the level of the gene. This watershed leaves a double legacy: \nit spawns a new business sector \u2013 Biotech or Life Sciences \u2013 and raises questions. In \n1976, Boyer founds one of the first biotech firms in California, GENENTECH. This \nact of scientific entrepreneurship models a boom of joint ventures between \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 13\n  New Genetics and Society \nuniversities and private capital in the 1980s and 1990s (Haber, 1996). Many of these \nyoung companies go to the stock market in the 1990s, which leads to a flood of \nhyperbole business news promising a lucrative future to potential investors.  \n \nMedia Saliance, Evaluation and Public Optimism on Biotechnology\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n19\n73\n19\n74\n19\n75\n19\n76\n19\n77\n19\n78\n19\n79\n19\n80\n19\n81\n19\n82\n19\n83\n19\n84\n19\n85\n19\n86\n19\n87\n19\n88\n19\n89\n19\n90\n19\n91\n19\n92\n19\n93\n19\n94\n19\n95\n19\n96\n19\n97\n19\n98\n19\n99\n20\n00\n20\n01\n20\n02\nin\nde\nx \n19\n99\n=1\n00\n \/ \n%\n o\npt\nim\nis\nm\n-0.80\n-0.60\n-0.40\n-0.20\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\n1.20\nev\nal\nua\ntio\nn\nst\nd\nOptimism\nSalience\nUKeval-std\n \n \nFigure 3 shows the rise and later fall in salience, the cycle of evaluation in the \npress, and the changing public optimism about biotechnology in opinion \nsurveys. Salience is indexed to 100 in 1999, when 1666 articles on \nbiotechnology were published in a single quality newspaper source (left \nscale). The index of evaluation shows the deviation from the long-term slightly \npositive average: low figures indicate evaluations more negative, positive \nfigures indicate evaluations more positive than average (right scale: mean = \n0; std dev = 1). The dark bars give the percentage of UK respondents who \ndeclare optimistic expectations about biotechnology when asked in 1978, \n1991, 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2002 (left scale).   \n \nOn the other hand, the group of scientists involved in recombinant DNA research \npublish an open letter (Berg et al., 1974) simultaneously in Nature and Science \npointing to potential hazards of their research. They call for a moratorium until the \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 14\n  New Genetics and Society \nrisks of rDNA research are defined and contained. The 1975 Asilomar conference in \nCalifornia discusses these points in a semi-public forum. Similar discussions take \nplaced in Britain and elsewhere. This is a historical first: hitherto scientists have been \nconcerned with breaking the social constraints on their enquiries, now the avantguard \nblows the whistle on themselves (Yoxen 1983). Initially the concerns are laboratory \nand public health hazards, later environmental and developmental risks, and the ethics \nof such designs which put at disposition the very nature of \u2018human nature\u2019 (Rose,  \n2001).   \n \nBoth streams of events prove historically significant, however, have little immediate \npublic visibility as shown in figure 3. We find increased coverage by 1977-78, a dip \nin press evaluation, and a moderate level of optimism over these new developments in \npublic perceptions; 38% of British think rDNA research is worthwhile. Soon the \nscepticism of Berg et al. and Asilomar will be displaced by the celebration of \nscientific progress and economic prospects of biotechnology (Yoxen, 1983), and the \nbig story of 1977-78 is the birth of Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby (Turney, \n1998). In the 1970s, reproduction is part of the discourse of \u2018biology turned into a \ntechnology\u2019.  But Britain at the time worried about many other things: energy crisis, \nthe winter of discontent, the punks, high inflation and several elections.  \n \nBy 1980 the new British government of Margaret Thatcher officially recognises, as \ndid the OECD and others, that new biotechnology is the future. This is reflected in the \nrising enthusiasm in the press. Coverage grows exponentially and continued to do so \nto its peak in 1999, rising from a monthly news item to five or six stories a day in a \nsingle newspaper. The year 1984, the test year for Orwell\u2019s dark predictions, sees the \narrival of \u2018DNA fingerprinting\u2019, a British invention. Henceforth crime news carries \ngenetic references. The identification of the remains of the former Russian royal \nfamily became \u2018gene talk\u2019 in the early 1990s (Durant, Hansen & Bauer, 1996). In \n1990 the European Community regulates the release of genetically modified \norganisms into the environment with leading British input, and the debate cools off: \nreduced salience but stable evaluations. At the time, many observers felt that the \ncontroversy over biotechnology, as far as there ever was one, was now settled and \nclosed. In hind-sight, we now know it occurred differently.   \n \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 15\n  New Genetics and Society \nFor the 1990s we can compare public perceptions and mass media discourse. After \n1984 the media enthusiasm cools off, while optimism in public perceptions continues \nto rise until 1993. Optimistic attitudes increase from about one third in 1978 to over \n50% of the population by 1993. Thereafter optimism shrinks to 30% by 1999 and \nremains at that level by 2002. This trend reversal in public perceptions appears to \nfollow that of the mass media discourse, but with a considerable time lag. However, \nour data is not conclusive here. I am not aware of any public perception data of \nbiotechnology in the mid 1980s, when media enthusiasm was at its peak. A \nhypothetical poll in 1985 might show equally enthusiastic attitudes as displayed in the \nmedia discourse, and thus show a closely parallel decline in optimism in media and \nperceptions from the mid 1980s onwards. On the other hand 1985 is the year when the \nRoyal Society laments the deficient public appreciation of science in its famous report \n(Royal Society, 1985), which, if the tone of that report can be considered evidential, \nwould suggest that public attitudes did not mirror the media discourse at the time.   \n \n1994 sees the arrival of genetically modified (gm) food products on supermarket \nshelves, the CALGENE Flavr Savr tomato in the US and the ZENECA tomato paste in \nBritain. Both products have a short life cycle, less because of consumer rejection - \nconsumer were given little opportunity to make decisions - more because of corporate \nreasons (Martineau, 2001). The first consensus conference on plant biotechnology \ntakes place in 1994. Experimenting with public participation, a model of public \ndeliberation imported from Denmark (see Joss & Durant, 1995; Einsiedel, 2001), \ncoincides with the launch of these first gm food products. The term \u2018Frankenfood\u2019 \nwas coined either by the Daily Mail or the Telegraph alluding to the myth of Dr \nFrankenstein\u2019s monstrous design which, once carelessly abandoned, strikes back. This \nimage resonates with a public opinion that is already sensitised to food issues. Britain \nis going through a series of food scares and, since 1985, the BSE epidemic in cattle. \n\u2018MAD COW CAN KILL\u2019 prints the Daily Mirror on the day following the \ngovernment\u2019s official admission of a link between BSE and vCJD (variant Creutzfeld- \nJacob Disease) on 19 March 1996. The lingering issue of \u2018dangerous British beef\u2019 \nspreads through the mass media of Europe (Bauer et al, 2006b) and changes the scene \nfor things to come.   \n \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 16\n  New Genetics and Society \nEngulfed by a global mission and ignoring early warnings of limited consumer \nenthusiasm for gm food, available from Eurobarometer surveys (Gaskell et al.,  1997), \nthe new Live Science sector and crop producers steam roll ahead. Imports of \nMonsanto\u2019s Round-up Ready gm soya into Europe from autumn 1996 onwards fall \ninto a climate of opinion that creates an opportunity for issue entrepreneurs (Lassen et \nal, 2002). An EU regulatory loophole on food labelling allows the mobilisation of \nconsumer and environmental concerns. What follows puts into doubt not only the \nagrochemical multinational MONSANTO, but the entire project of  a \u2018Second Green \nRevolution\u2019 to feed the world in the 21st century. Sabotaged field trials, blockaded \nships and other stunts create world wide attention. British food retailers such as \nTESCO and SAINSBURY pledge to avoid and to label products with gm ingredients. \nGm feed and foods, now globally controversial, stall an emerging consensus in \ninternational regulations based on the US model of 1985. Europe sees a de-facto \nmoratorium on gm crops and foods between 1998 and 2004 sustained by Brazilian \nexports of non-gm soya (Bauer, 2006).   \n \nAs if gm crops do not make enough \u2018gene drama\u2019, in February 1997, the Scottish \nRoslin Institute announces, in a letter to Nature, the first successful cloning of an \nadult sheep some 18 month ago (Wilmut et al, 1997). Photographs of Dolly the sheep \ngazing into the cameras travel fast and create concurrent world news. The story \ndevelops immediately into a moral outcry over the possibility of human cloning. \nIronically, the translation of \u2018adult nucleic transfer\u2019 into \u2018cloning\u2019, which offers a \nmuch richer anchor for social representations, does not come from the scientists but \nfrom Nature\u2019s own press release (Einsiedel et al, 2002). The more recent controversy \nover stem cell cloning takes its impetus from the Dolly alarm and merges with the \nlingering awareness of human genome mapping which started in 1990 with very little \npublic attention (Durant, Hansen & Bauer, 1996).  \n \nGm soya and the cloning of Dolly are watershed events in the public career of \ngenetics during 1990s. Henceforth, public discourses split into \u2018green\u2019 agricultural \nbiotechnology, sceptically observed, and \u2018red\u2019 biomedical biotechnology with moral \nquestions but generally supported because it gives or save lives. The press measurably \ncultivated this separation (Bauer, 2002a and 2005). The public deliberations of \u2018GM \nNation\u2019 in 2002 are an expression of the split frame: debating GREEN conveniently \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 17\n  New Genetics and Society \nfocuses protest energies and shields RED from undue attention.vi This course of \nevents has some similarity with the 1950s, when strategic efforts were made to split \nthe public atom into a military and a civil nuclear power under the banner of \u2018Atoms \nfor Peace\u2019 (Langer, 1995). Weather this was, considering the techno-scientific \ninfrastructure, a substantive or a rhetorical split preoccupies analysts ever since facing \nthe issue of proliferation (Weiss, 2003). The aftermaths of the 11th of September 2001 \nbrought to public attention that biotechnology might have a proliferation problem, \ntoo. However, significant by its absence, in our press corpus less than 0.5 percent of \narticles refer to a potential military uses of biotechnology, and all references predate \nthe events of 2001. vii\n       \n \nConclusions: towards longitudinal comparative research  \n \nIn this paper I distinguished two 25(+) year long phases, 1946-1972 and 1973-2002, \nin British public sentiments over genetics and biotechnology. Each phase comprises a \nwave of rising and declining enthusiasm.viii Several topics were identified that \nengaged public opinion through these phases of enthusiasm and concern. Scientists \nthemselves raised the alarm on potential hazards of genetic engineering in mid 1970s, \nbut with limited impact at the time. These concerns were crowded out by hype and \nenthusiasm for this strategic technology of the 21st century. Twenty years later \nlingering concerns resurfaced and merged with others, such as food safety, \nglobalisation and bioethics. This time round the public resonance was far greater. \nToday, the actor-networks of rDNA and genomics engages debates over the safety of \ngm foods, the environmental soundness of gm crops, the corporate dominance over \ngm seeds and biodiversity, the patenting of life forms, the psychological and social \nconsequences of genetic identity, the ethics of genetic testing, enhancement and \nembryonic stem cell cloning, the risks of xenotransplants, the prospects of \nindividualised medicines and the reliability of DNA finger printing in a genetic \ninformation society.  \n \nOur data shows that the trend has changed towards a more sceptical public attitude to \nbiotechnology, so much deplored in the 1990s, started in the press already in the mid \n1980s, and was observable in public perceptions by mid 1990s. The public events of \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 18\n  New Genetics and Society \n1996\/97 did not initiate this trend change, but catalysed it. They internationalised the \ndebate and split it worldwide into a matter of either GREEN or RED biotechnology. \nWhile corporate actors ignored early warnings, issue entrepreneurs successfully \ncapitalised on the changing public sentiment and cornered the debate on GREEN \nbiotechnology in Britain, probably to the relief of anybody working on RED \nbiomedical biotechnology.   \n \nUnder a long-term perspective, it is tempting to compare biotechnology to other \ntechnologies and their paths through public opinion. The source of historical analogy \nof genetic engineering will continue to preoccupy actors interested in technological \nfutures. Is it the civil nuclear power, the hurdle of public opinion was raised some \ntwenty years after a promising start in 1956; or is it the information technologies with \nits bubbling waves of new enthusiasms?  I dare no prediction.  \n \nTo tell the history of the public imagination of genetics is an historian\u2019s task. Jon \nTurney (1998) admirably traced the footsteps of Frankenstein\u2019s monster through \nvarious episodes of the popular imagination of biology. This paper might contribute \ntwo ideas to such ambitions: a criterion for periodization and longitudinal indicators. \nOn the example of Britain, I demonstrated two long-term and nested phases in public \nsentiments towards DNA, genetics and biotechnology based on news coverage and \nthe evaluation of events offered by this coverage. These phases reflect research \nevents, but also trends in the \u2018Zeitgeist\u2019, the spatio-temporal mentality. Historians \nmay find it helpful to consider such indicators in the construction of a narrative of \npopular genetics. Also, I hope to have demonstrated the need for and the advantages \nof longitudinal indicators, even seemingly crude ones based on content analysis. The \nfluctuating nature of public sentiment, as demonstrated on biotechnology, alerts \nreaders to the risks of basing a trend analysis on the comparison of few time windows \nwith little information in between. The graphics presented in this paper show that, \nwould one pick different windows over the 50 years, very different conclusions on \ntrends would result. I summarise the caveat like this: better simple and longitudinal \n(large t) than few and far apart cross-sections (small t). In any problem area, curves \nshow best whether one is on the way into or on the way out of trouble. Some \nmethodologists generally call for more continuous data streams in psychology and the \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 19\n  New Genetics and Society \nsocial sciences to overcome much conceptual and methodological nonsense and to \nenhance causal understanding of processes (Fassnacht, 2000). I concord. \n \nA final comment on how unique this British story might be. Our past research has \nshown considerable divergence in timing and substance of the biotechnology debates, \nwithin Europe, across the Atlantic, and across the Americas (see Gaskell & Bauer, \n2001). The global convergence on such matters is either wishful thinking or political \nagenda (see Jasanoff, 2005). The international comparison of the representations of \nscience and technology in the press must expect convergence and divergence. It is \nlikely that the public take-off of modern biotechnology is a common feature. \nHowever, the timing and the steadiness in increase of coverage during the 1980s, or \nthe watershed years of 1996\/97 leaves ample space for comparative puzzles.  \nSynchronicity is a criterion for an emergent trans-national public sphere, across \nEurope or globally. However, time is fractal and the particular time window of \n\u2018synchronicity\u2019 determines the conclusion (see for example Seifert, 2003). These are \neminently empirical questions that depend on the availability of comparable data \nstreams. For the period after 1973, our mass media database covers eighteen different \ncountries across Europe, North America, and Japan, and researchers are invited to \nconsult, contribute and analyse this growing database. Let a thousand comparisons \nflourish ! A global public opinion of science and technology is in the making and the \nchallenge is to track it as it happens.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n  \nI thank my colleagues, the \u2018we\u2019 of the project \u2018Biotechnology and the Public\u2019 (various \ntypes of EU funding 1994-2003) who kept alive a climate of discussion over years. \nAn earlier, shorter version of this paper was published in Brazil during a CNPq \nsabbatical Fellowship entitled \u2018O dominio publico do DNA \u2013 tendencias a longo \nprazo, Ciencia & Amciente - \u2018DNA: 50 anos\u2019, 2003, 26,129-140 (Universidade \nFederal de Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul).

Occasionally this right to freedom is challenged and tested in courts. \nBritain regularly figures in the upper 15% of the worlds\u2019 countries. In 2002 it ranked 21, in 2004 it \nranked 24 of 170 ranked countries, top are Scandinavian countries (see reporters without borders on \nwww.rsf.org).    \nii There is a rhetorical game played by social scientists: first one proclaims a revolution, the axial \ntransition into a new society; and later, to reassure the regulators or when the \u2018revolution\u2019 takes longer \nthan expected, one calls it off again. Both observations will be news that hit the headlines.  \niii I use \u2018we\u2019 in this section, because the methodology is the collective effort of the project \n\u2018Biotechnology and the Public\u2019 including colleagues from 18 countries.  \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 25\n  New Genetics and Society \n                                                                                                                                                                      \niv This peak of 1666 references to genes or biotechnology needs to be kept in perspective. Back in 1998 \nthe Guardian regularly compared weekly press coverage: in the eight months May-December 1998, the \nevents in Northern Ireland or \u2018Clinton Gate\u2019 got two to three times more coverage than all the science \nrelated stories during that period together. Human stem cell cloning got about 300 column inches in \nDecember 1998, while the Omagh bomb got 12 times more column inches back in August 1998 alone. \nHence, compared to political news events of the day biotechnology is at best a mid-size news item even \nat its peak.   \nv A new area of sociological research is claimed focussing on this kind of hyperbole: the sociology of \nexpectations (see Brown N & M Michael, 2003) \nvi One looks across the Atlantic to sees a mirror image: in the US the recent debate is focussed on the \nRED biotechnology, on genetic testing and in particular on embryonic stem cells cloning, while \nGREEN biotechnology seems to be a non-issue as far as policy is concerned; this is often referred as to \nas \u2018transatlantic gap\u2019. In the US this reflects the power of lobbying to set the policy agenda on Capitol \nHill (see TenEyck, 2001 and Sheingate, in print)   \nvii Our 18-country press corpus contains 106 references to military uses out in a total of over 20000 \narticles or 60000 gene references (an article is coded for up to three references), of which 23, mainly \nUS references, are from 2001 or 2002.   \nviii One might be tempted to speak of long cycles, but \u2018cycles\u2019 connote too much regularity. To avoid a \nfalse impression of regularity I used the terms \u2018phases\u2019 and \u2018waves\u2019 to identify the ups and downs in \ncoverage and evaluation.   \nPublic Career of DNA   MWB LSE Feb 2006 26\n"}
