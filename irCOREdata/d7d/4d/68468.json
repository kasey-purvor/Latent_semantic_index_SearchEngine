C. Hendry and P. V. E. McClintock\nDepartment of Physics,\nUniversity of Lancaster,\nLancaster LAl 4YB, UK.\nA 4He isotopic purification cryostat has been developed, capable of sustained operation in\ncontinuous flow. Starting from a feedstock of helium of the natural isotopic ratio, 3He\/4He\n= x3 \u2248 10\u22127, it yields a purified product for which x3 < 5\u00d7 10\u221213 at a production rate of\n3.3 STP m3 h\u22121. The isotopically purified 4He is being used for a variety of applications,\nincluding quantum evaporation experiments, studies of ion motion at the He II\/vacuum\ninterface, down-scattering and containment of ultra-cold neutrons, and investigations of\nthe breakdown of superfluidity in 4He.\nKeywords: cryostats; helium; separation techniques; isotopic purification\n1\nPublished in Cryogenics 27, 131-138 (1987).\nIsotopically pure 4He is required for use in a wide range of applications. Of the several\ncryogenic devices that have been devised for its preparation, all reported to date1\u22128 have\nemployed batch processing techniques of one form or another and they have, therefore,\nbeen limited in the quantity of material that could be prepared in the course of one\nthermal cycle. In some cases2\u22125 there have also been limitations on the level of isotopic\npurity that could be attained.\nCertain applications require liquid litre quantities of 4He of a quite exceptionally\nhigh standard of isotopic purity, the most demanding of all, probably, being the super-\nthermal ultra-cold neutron (UCN) source9 which, in the particular case of the Institut\nLaue-Langevin (ILL) instrument10, requires \u223c 15 dm3 of liquid 4He containing less than\na part in 1012 of 3He (cf. naturally occurring helium with a 3He\/4He ratio of x3 ' 10\u22127).\nA batch processor is inherently unsuitable for the preparation of 4He of this purity and\nquantity. Such a purifier would either have to be of enormous physical dimensions or,\nalternatively, as used until recently at the ILL8, a smaller machine must be thermally\ncycled several times, making a few liquid Iitres of purified 4He on each occasion. The\nlatter procedure takes a matter of weeks to complete and can be totally vitiated by any\nhardware failure or operator error that occurs during this period. It must, therefore, be\nconsidered rather hazardous and unsatisfactory.\nIt is against this background that we have been developing what is believed to be\nthe first continuous flow helium isotopic purifier. The instrument to be described below\nproduces 4He in which the 3He content is undetectable, even after reconcentration11 , and\nis certainly < 5 \u00d7 10\u221213. It is of relatively modest dimensions but, because the product\ncan be extracted continuously, without warming the cryostat, there is effectively no upper\nlimit to the quantity of purified 4He that can be prepared during any one thermal cycle\nfrom room temperature. Brief reports on an early prototype12, and on the preliminary\nresults obtained from the present purifier13, have already been published.\nPrevious work on helium isotopic separation has been reviewed in an earlier paper1 and\nthe discussion need not be repeated here. Since that paper was published, however, two\nother isotopic purifiers have been reported and should be mentioned. Both are relatively\nsmall scale instruments based on the use of superfluid heat flush (see below). First,\nYoshiki and his co-workers6 have built a prototype purifier, for incorporation into a UCN\n2\nexperiment, using a single-shot arrangement with a rouge superleak, rather similar in\ngeneral design to the purifier previously reported1. Second, Moss et al. have developed\nan interesting variant of the heat flush purifier that is capable of pressurizing a gas bottle\nat room temperature to 3 \u00d7 106 Pa with isotopically pure 4He, yet manages to avoid\ninclusion of the usual mechanical valve at low temperature.\nIsotopic purification by superfluid heat flush\nThe basis of isotopic purification by superfluid heat flush has already been described1. It\nexploits the concentration gradient that develops in a dilute 3He-4He solution subject to\na flux of heat where, as outlined in Figure 1, the corresponding current of normal fluid\ncomponent tends to flush the 3He atoms away with it. For a semi-infinite flushing tube\nopen at one end to a bath of He II where the 3He concentration is u(0), provided that\nsteady state conditions have been established and provided that no 3He can enter the\ntube except through its open end, the 3He concentration, u(x), within the tube is given\nby the one-dimensional form of the equation of gas attack\nu(x) = u(0) exp(\u2212vnx\/D) (1)\nwhere: x is the distance from the mouth of the tube; vn is the normal fluid flow velocity;\nand D is the coefficient of mass diffusion for the 3He. Insertion into Equation (1) of\nreadily attainable values of vn and x, together with the values of D measured by Ptukha\n14,\ndemonstrates1 immediately that the heat flush phenomenon can provide the basis of an\nexceedingly powerful technique for isotopic separation.\nIt is interesting to consider how the efficacy of the technique may be expected to vary\nwith the temperature, T , for a given heat flux. Both vn and D will vary rapidly with\nT , but the effects of their temperature dependences on the exponent in Equation (1) will\ntend to cancel. The normal fluid velocity is given by\nvn = Q\u02d9\/\u03c1ST (2)\nwhere: Q\u02d9 is the heat flowing per unit area of cross-section; \u03c1 is the bulk liquid density;\nand S is the entropy per unit mass. If we consider only temperatures T > 1 K, S can be\napproximated by the roton entropy15\n3\nSr =\n2(kB\u00b5)\n1\/2p20\u2206\n(2pi)3\/2\u03c1~3T 1\/2\n{\n1 +\n3kBT\n2\u2206\n}\nexp(\u2212\u2206\/kBT ) (3)\nwhere \u2206, P0 and \u00b5 are the roton parameters. The value of D for the extremely dilute\nsolutions that we are considering is determined for the temperature range in question\nalmost exclusively by interactions between rotons and 3He quasiparticles: it will, therefore,\nbe inversely proportional to the roton number density\nNr =\n2(\u00b5kBT )\n1\/2p20\n(2pi)3\/2~3\nexp(\u2212\u2206\/kBT ) (4)\nso that\nD = \u03b1\/Nr (5)\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant that can be determined from Ptukha\u2019s measurementsl4 of D(T ).\nCombining Equations (2)-(5), we can write the coefficient of x in the exponent of Equation\n(1) as\n\u2212vn\nD\n=\n\u2212Q\u02d9\n\u03b1kB(\n3\n2\nT + \u2206\/kB)\n(6)\nwhich, it may immediately be noted, depends only weakly on T because the exponential\nterms from Equations (3) and (4) have cancelled. By comparison of Ptukha\u2019s measurement\nof D at 1.4 K with Equations (4) and (5), incorporating accepted values16 of the roton\nparameters, we find that \u03b1 = 2.4\u00d7 1019 m\u22121s\u2212l, so that Equation (1) becomes\nu = u0 exp\u2212{Q\u02d9x\/[5.0\u00d7 10\u22124(T + 5.8)]} (7)\nwhere T is in K, Q\u02d9 is in W m\u22122 and x is in m. This relation gives the concentration\ngradient for any given heat flux and temperature. The modulus of the coefficient of x in\nthe exponent, equal vnn\/D, is plotted as a function of T for various values of Q in Figure\n2.\nErring on the side of prudence, we have adopted as a criterion for satisfactory oper-\nation of the purifier that 3He atoms should not be able to back-diffuse more than 1 mm\nagainst the normal fluid wind. The dashed line in Figure 2 corresponds to u\/u0 = 10\n\u221230\nfor x = 1 mm in Equation (7). Provided that the working point lies above this line then,\n4\nin principle, 3He should be eliminated completely from the purified product during its\npassage through the flushing tube (whose length, in practice, is much greater than 1 mm:\nsee below).\nThere are a number of points in relation to the above discussion that deserve further\nconsideration. The first is that the use of Equation (1) for the analysis is valid only under\nsteady state conditions. It is also, of course, essential that u\/u0 should become effectively\nequal to zero within a distance which is small compared to the length of the flushing\ntube, so that the latter can properly be considered semi-infinite. The establishment of\nsteady state conditions after initiation of the normal fluid wind will require at least a few\nnormal fluid transit times. At the higher temperatures, where vn for any given Q becomes\nrelatively small because of the large values taken by S in Equation (2), a significant length\nof time must elapse before Equation (1) can be assumed to be applicable. Even more\nimportant, perhaps, is that, particularly where vn is small, the system will be vulnerable\nto instabilities of various kinds.\nSecondly, it should be noted that our model1, in which we considered a gas (the 3He\natoms) diffusing within a moving medium (the normal fluid component), is valid only\nwhen the 3He\/roton mean free path is very small compared to the dimensions of the\nflushing tube. At low enough temperatures, where the opposite limit will apply, the 3He\nwill behave, instead, like a Knudsen gas in the \u201cmechanical vacuum\u201d of the superfluid\ncomponent: it will be virtually unaffected by the rarified wind of rotons (and phonons,\nwhich, to a first approximation, we can ignore because the 3He-phonon scattering cross-\nsection is relatively small) that constitute the current of heat. The problem then no longer\ninvolves diffusion of 3He within the normal fluid and the arguments leading to Equation\n(1) do not apply. We can estimate the temperature at which the transition will occur\nbetween these two regimes of behaviour by making use of the approximate expression17\nD = (kBT\/M3)\n1\/2(\u03c3Nr)\n\u22121 (8)\nwhere M3 is the\n3He atomic mass and \u03c3 is the roton-3He scattering cross-section. From\na comparison of Equations (5) and (8), and by making use of our numerical estimate of\n\u03b1, above, we obtain a value for \u03c3 of 2.47 \u00d7 10\u221218 m2. The roton-3He mean free path, \u03bb,\nthen follows from\n5\n\u03bb = (\u03c3Nr)\n\u22121 (9)\nUsing the above value of \u03c3 in conjunction with tabulated values16 of Nr we find that\n\u03bb = 0.4 mm at 0.5 K, and = 30 mm at 0.4 K. For a flushing tube with a diameter, typically,\nof several millimetres, we conclude that Equation (1) will certainly become inapplicable\nfor temperatures significantly below 0.5 K.\nThirdly, the model relates exclusively to the limit where the number density of 3He\natoms, N3, is very much smaller than Nr. At low enough temperatures, or large enough\nvalues of N3, the opposite limit will apply and, again, Equation (1) will be inapplicable.\nN3 for the feedstock of natural helium is ' 4 \u00d7 1021 m\u22123; Nr is equal to this figure15 at\n' 0.55 K, and is 10 times greater than it at 0.65 K. So we may regard the criterion of\nN3 \u001c Nr as being well satisfied for T > 0.7 K. If N3 rises above the value for natural\nhelium, then a correspondingly higher temperature will, of course, be required. This\nlatter observation also provides an explanation for the, at first sight, seemingly vexatious\nquestion of how a 3He-4He diiution refrigerator can operate successfully, given that the\n3He on the dilute side of the system must diffuse against the normal fluid wind blowing in\nthe tube connecting the still, typically at 0.7 K, to the very much colder mixing chamber.\nThe crucial difference lies in the 3He concentration. For the dilution refrigerator, where\nthe 3He concentration will be a few per cent, the temperature at which Nr = N3 is shifted\nwell above 1 K. At 0.7 K, therefore, the 3He mean free path is determined mainly by\n3He-3He collisions; 3He-roton collisions will be of relatively minor significance; and the\nmodel from which Equation (1) is derived will be inapplicable. Thus, although there will\nbe some tendency for the current of normal fluid to reduce the circulation rate of 3He\naround the system, the circulation will not be prevented from occurring altogether and\nthe refrigerator, therefore, functions as observed in practice.\nFourthly, although we have discussed the purification process in terms of average\nvalues of vn, it must be borne in mind that vn will not, in fact, be uniform over the\ncross-section of the flushing tube. The axial velocity profile to be expected is subject to\nsome uncertainty18, but it seems likely that vn will be zero at the walls and that it will\nattain its maximum value on the axis of the tube. Thus, the back-diffusion of 3He will\noccur, principally, close to the walls. Radial diffusion will also be taking place, however,\n6\nso that, provided that the length of the flushing tube is much greater than both its own\nradius and also the distance over which u decays effectively to zero (our criterion, above,\nof 1 mm) when calculated on the basis of the average vn, the purification scheme should\nstill be efficacious. As an additional safeguard, we have contrived (see below) that there\nshould, in practice, be a radial component of vn towards the axis of the flushing tube\nover most of its length, so that 3He will continually be carried away from the walls and\ntowards the region of higher axial velocity.\nFifthly, we have so far taken no account of the fact that the He II in the flushing tube\nwill, in reality, be turbulent18. Although a tangle of quantized vortex lines represents\na collective motion of the superfluid component, the vortex cores effectively scatter the\nexcitations that comprise the normal fluid. As a result, the tangle formed in a simple\nthermal counterflow tends to drift in the direction of the normal fluid flow19, although\nwith a velocity considerably smaller than vn. In our case, with an imposed mass flow in\naddition and hence, effectively, an enhanced value of vs, the situation is more complicated.\nIt seems probable, though, that the lines will usually still move in the same direction as\nvn because the enhancement of vs is normally chosen to be small compared to its absolute\nvalue. Whether or not the vortex lines can affect the purification process in reality must\ndepend on the relative magnitudes per unit volume of the net roton\/3He cross-section and\nthe net vortex\/3He cross-section. To estimate the latter quantity we need a value of the\nequilibrium length, L0, of the vortex line per unit volume, given approximately\n18 by\nL\n1\/2\n0 = 1.03\u03b3(V \u2212 V0) (10)\nwhere \u03b3 is a temperature dependent quantity involving the phenomenological Vinen pa-\nrameters, for which experimental values have been determined,\nV = vn + vs (11)\nis the relative velocity of the (usually oppositely directed) normal and superfluid compo-\nnents, and\nV0 ' (\u03b3d)\u22121 (12)\n7\nwhere d is the smallest dimension of the flow tube. Taking typical values of d = 16 mm,\nQ = 2\u00d7 103 Wm\u22122 and the value18 of \u03b3 = 1.2\u00d7 106 sm\u22122 at T = 1.4 K derived from the\nSchwarz model20 of superfluid turbulence, it is straightforward to demonstrate that for this\ntemperature, L0 = 10\n10 m\u22122. If the characteristic length21 for the vortex\/3He interaction\nis 1.8 nm, then the total vortex\/3He cross-section per unit volume for these conditions\nwill be ' 20 m\u22121. This is to be compared with the total roton\/3He cross-section, Nr\u03c3,\nwhich at 1.4 K is 4\u00d7 108 m\u22121. Scattering of 3He by the (slowly moving) vortex lines will\nthus occur at a rate negligible compared to their scattering by rotons and the 3He will\nnot, therefore, be entrained by the drifting vortex tangle. For temperatures > 0.5 K, the\ntrapping of 3He on vortex lines in our very dilute solutions can also be ignored22.\nThe conclusions to be drawn from these various considerations are that, for effective\nheat flush isotopic purification of natural helium: 1, the heat flux should be chosen so that\nthe working point lies above the dashed line in Figure 2; 2, the operating temperature\nmust be > 0.7 K; but 3, to avoid inconveniently long equilibration times and to provide\nsome defence against instabilities, the temperature should not be too close to that of the\nlambda point, where vn becomes very small. A suitable operating temperature in the\nrange 1.2 < T < 1.6 K is readily obtainable with a pumped bath of liquid 4He.\nContinuous flow 4He isotopic purification\nThe majority of the isotopic purification cryostats1\u22123,5\u22128 previously reported in the\nliterature were based on variants of the design outlined in Figure 3. Helium from a\npumped bath of He II (a in Figure 3) at '1.3 K is allowed to pass under gravity (except\nin one case where a fountain pump was used to fill a receiving vessel situated above the\nmain bath) to fill a receiving vessel (b). The earlier purifiers2,3 relied entirely upon a\nsuperleak (c) to effect isotopic separation and did not necessarily provide an evacuated\nspace around the product. In later designs1,5\u22127 a source of heat, Q\u02d9, was provided just\nabove the superieak to exploit the heat flush purification effect discussed above. In one\nrecent purifier8 the superieak was dispensed with altogether; the direction of Vn and the\nbulk flow velocity being controlled, instead, by a needle valve. In no case was provision\nmade for extraction of the product while the purifier was at its operating temperature. It\nwould have been difficult to do so because, with a saturated vapour pressure above the\n8\nproduct of, at most, a few torr, conventional pressure driven cryogenic transfer techniques\ncould not be used. If two separate (cryogenic) 4He baths are provided, however, one of\nthem being at 4.2 K under atmospheric pressure, with the other at '1.3 K providing the\ncold base temperature for the heat flush, the problem can readily be overcome because a\nnon-negligible pressure differential can then be established to drive helium continuously\nround the purification loop.\nThe basis of operation of the first such continuous flow purifier to be reported12 is\nsketched in Figure 4. Liquid helium from a bath (a in Figure 4) under atmospheric pressure\nat 4.2 K passes down a cupro-nickel concentric tube heat exchanger (b) and enters the\nflushing tube (c) close to its colder end, adjacent to a pumped pot (d) of liquid 4He at '1.3\nK with which the flushing tube is in thermal contact. The main flow in the flushing tube\nis oppositely directed to the normal fluid flow induced by the heat input (Q\u02d9): a superleak\n(e) in the flushing tube serves to block any flow of normal fluid in the direction of the mass\nflow. The purified product passes up the other side of the heat exchanger (b) and exits\nfrom the cryostat through the outlet tube (f). The liquid within the purification loop is\nall approximately at atmospheric pressure, but the small pressure differential induced by\npumping the outlet is sufficient to drive helium continuously through the system. This\ndevice was moderately successful in that, after various modifications to the flushing tube,\nit produced 4He in which the 3He was undetectable (< 2 \u00d7 10\u221210). On other occasions,\nhowever, a product purity of only 2\u00d7 10\u22129 was attained. The reasons for the inconsistent\nbehaviour are unknown for certain, but they are believed to have been associated with\ninstabilities (at the outlet) that prevented steady state conditions from being maintained\nwithin the flushing tube.\nThe purifier design illustrated in Figure 4 is inherently inefficient because, as a result\nof the presence of the superleak, the heat flowing down the moving columns of liquid\nin the heat exchanger is all transferred to the colder end of the flushing tube. It does\nnot, therefore, contribute significantly to the purification process. Furthermore, the huge\nsurface area and long out-gassing time of the superleak itself provide a potential source\nof contamination if it should at any time inadvertently be exposed to natural helium.\nThese problems have all been overcome in the modified design that we have now\nevolved, which is outlined very diagrammatically in Figure 5. The incoming stream of\n9\nhelium from the main bath (a in Figure 5) still enters the flushing tube (c) at its colder\nend, but the associated flux of heat enters the flushing tube at its warmer end. This is\naccomplished by making the flushing tube of copper and providing it with a closely fitting\ncopper jacket through which the incoming stream of helium passes. There is no superleak.\nWith this arrangement, all of the heat leaking down the cupro-nickel heat exchanger,\nregardless of whether it enters through the inlet or outlet side, eventually passes through\nthe inside of the flushing tube along most of its length, increasing the average axial normal\nfluid velocity and thereby enhancing the efficiency of the purification process. The second\nadvantage to be derived from this particular arrangement is that some normal fluid will\neffectively be entering the flushing tube radially through its walls. This helps to prevent\n3He atoms becoming trapped or back-diffusing (see above) within the boundary layer,\nwhere the axial component of vn tends to zero.\nContinuous flow isotopic purifier\nIn reality, the continuous flow purifier is rather more complicated than the sketch of\nFigure 5 would appear to imply. This is because, in particular, it has been necessary to\nmake provision for the removal of extracted 3He from the flushing tube; it has also been\nimportant to minimize the thermal resistance between the liquid helium in the purification\ncircuit and that in the pumped pot. Both of these requirements are met by the inclusion\nof a conical copper heat exchanger of the type discussed previously1.\nA more detailed schematic diagram of the purifier, and a photograph of the insert\nwith the vacuum can removed, are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. Circulation of\nhelium through the purification loop occurs in the manner already described, with isotopic\nseparation occurring within the flushing tube (c in Figure 6). The latter consists of a 2\nm length of 14 mm i.d., 16 mm o.d. copper tube. To enable it to fit within the vacuum\ncan, it is divided into six separate lengths, connected by wide-bore junction pieces. The\nencircling sleeves on the individual sections of flushing tube are of 17 mm i.d., 19 mm\no.d. copper, connected together by short lengths of 3 mm o.d. cupro-nickel tube. The\nconcentric tube heat exchanger (f) is made up from a 3 m length of 3 mm o.d. cupro-nickel\ntubing inside 5 mm o.d., 0.2 mm wall, cupro-nickel tubing.\nThe pumped helium bath consists of a 38 mm i.d. stainless steel tube, closed at\n10\nthe bottom by the wide end of the copper cone (l) alluded to above. This bath can be\nfilled continuously: either through the part-closed needle valve (g3) from the main helium\nreservoir; or through needle valve g4 via a restriction (k) with slightly\n3He-enriched liquid\nhelium from within the narrow end of the cone. The restriction consists of '350 mm of\nnominally 0.3 mm i.d. cupro-nickel, this length being chosen such that its impedance is\nsuitable for maintenance of the helium level within the bath of He II (d) under steady\nstate circulation. The liquid level within the bath is monitored by a capacitance depth\ngauge. The bath is filled initially through g3 which is subsequently closed off again once\nnormal operation has been established. It is pumped through a 100 mm i.d. pumping\nline by an Edwards EH1200 mechanical booster, backed by a 1SC900 rotary pump.\nTo monitor the operation of the purifier, carbon resistance thermometers are posi-\ntioned just above and just below the cone, and at various positions along the flushing\ntube. Provision is made for the application of heat to the warm end of the flushing tube\nand directly to the pumped bath, using the heaters q1 and q2 (in Figure 6).\nThe isotopically purified liquid 4He leaves the cryostat through the exit tube (f) where\nit enters a standard helium transfer siphon. The liquid is evaporated in a heated copper\nballast volume at room temperature, passes through the small rotary pump that is used\nto induce the flow, and enters a 4.5 m3 flexible reservoir. At intervals, helium from the\nlatter is compressed into a bank of standard gas bottles, to a maximum pressure of 1800\npsi, by means of a Williams and James Triquad compressor. The latter has been modified\nslightly so that gas from the stage unloaders is returned to the laboratory helium recovery\nsystem but, otherwise, is exactly as provided by the manufacturers.\nIn an earlier version of the purifier, provision was made for collection of the extracted\n3He in a small copper pot immersed within the helium in the pumped bath (d in Figure\n6) in place of the present restriction (k). The 3He-enriched product was extracted via the\nguide tube (p) leading to needle valve g4. This arrangement had the disadvantage that,\nwhen the system was closed down overnight with g4 closed, while being kept at 4 K ready\nfor a resumption of production on the following day, any small leak in g4 would have\nenabled the collected 3He to leak back into the flushing tube. While any such inadvertent\ncontamination of the system should have cleared rapidly when the heat flush was re-\nestablished, it was felt to be undesirable. The quantities of 3He collected were, in any\n11\ncase, small. In the present version of the purifier, extracted 3He is removed continuously\nthrough the capillary restriction (k); no significant 3He enrichment occurs, therefore, in\nany part of the system during operation.\nOperation of the purifier\nThe operating procedure used for the purifier, in outline, is as follows. The device is leak\ntested at room temperature and at 77 K; its dewar is filled with liquid helium; thermal\nexchange gas in the vacuum space (j in Figure 6) is pumped out; the bath (d) is filled\nthrough needle valve g3; it is then pumped towards 1.2 K while, at the same time, the\ncarbon resistance thermometers are calibrated against 4He vapour pressure. The needle\nvalve g1 is then opened, admitting liquid helium to the flushing tube and cone.\nAt this stage, even in the absence of fluid flow through the purification system, there\nis a large static heat load on the pot (d) most of which arises from conduction through the\ncolumns of liquid in the concentric tube heat exchanger (b). The heat load becomes even\nlarger once flow has been initiated, but admission of liquid via the restriction and valve\ng4 is sufficient to maintain an approximately constant level within the He II bath (d). On\nfirst starting the flow, the pressure at the room temperature end of the siphon in the exit\ntube (f) undergoes large fluctuations, probably corresponding to the initial cooling down\nof the inside of the siphon. After a few minutes, however, the system settles down to a\nsteady state with a flow of 3.3 m3h\u22121 (the speed of the small rotary pump that draws\ngas through the system) of gas at STP. The pressure difference between the main 4He\nboth at 4.2 K and the outlet of the exit siphon settles at ' 104 Pa. The first few cubic\nmetres of isotopically purified product are used to purge air and other contaminants from\nthe rotary pump, compressor, reservoir, bottles and gas handling system; collection and\nstorage of the isotopically purified 4He commences once the purifier has been running in\na steady state for ' 1 h.\nIt is of interest to try to establish the magnitude of the heat current in the flushing\ntube, to ensure that the operating point of the system lies well above the dashed line\nof Figure 2. An a priori calculation, based on the dimensions of the system, would\nbe extremely difficult on account of the complicated nature of heat flow in He II; and\nparticularly given that there are continuous columns of liquid extending from a region at\n12\n1.2 K to one at 4.2 K, with T\u03bb somewhere in the concentric tube heat exchanger. We\ncan, however, make an experimental estimate of the heat current, by measurement of\nthe Kapitza temperature discontinuities at the copper cone. The temperature difference,\n\u2206T , across the cone is in practice, small, so we may assume the two discontinuities are\napproximately equal. Then\n\u2206T = 2(KR\/A)(Q\u02d90 + Q\u02d91) (13)\nwhere: KR is the Kapitza resistance; A is the surface area of one side of the cone; Q\u02d90 is\nthe heat current arising through conduction from the main helium reservoir; and Q\u02d91 is\nthe imposed heat current applied by energizing the heater (q1). The precise value of KR\nfor the (probably highly oxidized) surfaces of the copper cone is subject to considerable\nuncertainty, but we can establish Q0 by measurement of \u2206T for a range of values of Q\u02d91,\nas shown in Figure 8. These measurements were made in the absence of circulation, with\nthe He II bath (d) maintained at a constant temperature by adjustments to the power\ndissipated in a second heater (q2) positioned above the cone. From Equation (13) it is\nclear that the graph should be a straight line whose abscissa intercept yields directly a\nvalue of \u2212Q0. From a number of plots, such as that in Figure 8, fitting straight lines to\nthe data by the method of least squares, we have concluded that the static heat load on\nthe pot is\nQ\u02d90 = (0.8\u00b1 0.1) W (14)\nThe quoted uncertainty probably reflects a variation in the absolute value of Q\u02d90, corre-\nsponding to the gradual decrease in the temperature of the main helium reservoir that\ntook place between helium fills. The derived value of Q\u02d90 is consistent with the measured\nevaporation rate from the He II bath (d) with needle valves g3 and gl closed off.\nThe heat current, Q\u02d9F , in the presence of a mass flow was estimated in a similar\nmanner. Under standard operating conditions, with a throughput of 3.3 STP m3 h\u22121, the\nheat current in the flushing tube was found to be\nQ\u02d9F = (1.6\u00b1 1.1) W (15)\n13\nThe corresponding temperature gradient along the flushing tube was extremely small, the\ntemperature difference between its ends being 10\u00b1 2 mK.\nIt is evident that, even with the static heat load alone, the purifier functions within\nthe region of safe operation, well above the dashed line in Figure 2; under steady flow\nconditions, the heat flux close to the bottom of the cone is ' 104 Wm\u22121 , equivalent to\na point close to the top of the figure. It seems unlikely, therefore, that any 3He is able\nto enter the flushing tube itself. Rather, it will be flushed straight up into the cone as\nsoon as it emerges from the inlet tube from the sleeve and enters the normal fluid current.\nThe provision of a long flushing tube is, however, a valuable guard against inadvertent\ncontamination of the product as a consequence of the mechanical instabilities that occur\nduring the start-up period and that may also occur when any of the operating parameters\nis changed.\nResults\nSamples taken from the gas bottles after completion of a production run were analysed\nby mass spectrometry. The 3He content was found to be undetectable, implying that\nx3 < 2 \u00d7 10\u221210. Further samples of the gas were then reconcentrated in the miniature\nisotopic concentrator already described11. This procedure would have enhanced the con-\ncentration of any 3He that was present by a factor of almost 500. A sample of the resultant\nconcentrate was sent for analysis and, again, it was found that the 3He content was unde-\ntectable. We conclude, therefore, that the isotopic ratio of the 4He from the purifier was\n< 5\u00d7 10\u221213.\nThese results are consistent with our belief, based on the use of Equation (1), that\nthe helium emerging from the purifier is devoid of 3He; but there is, of course, no means\nof proving that this is in fact the case.\nHelium from the purifier (or from its earlier variants) has already been employed\nsuccessfully for experiments on quantum evaporation23, on the cyclotron resonance of ions\nat a He II surface24, and on the downscattering and containment of ultra-cold neutrons25,\nas well as in support of the Lancaster research programme on 4He superfluidity26\u221228 for\nwhich the device was originally developed.\n14\nConclusions\nThe 4He isotopic purification cryostat that we have described is capable of producing,\nin continuous operation and therefore in virtually unlimited quantities, a product whose\nisotopic ratio is certainly < 5\u00d7 10\u221213 and, in reality, probably a great deal smaller than\nthis. It is, therefore, capable of supporting even the most demanding of the applications\nof isotopically purified 4He that has yet been devised.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported in part by the University of Lancaster Research Fund and by\nthe Science and Engineering Research Council.

The main flow in the flushing tube is\noppositely directed to the normal fluid flow induced by the\nFigure 4 Diagram to illustrate the working principles of the\nprototype continuous flow heat flush isotopic purification\ncryostat. ii, Bath of liquid helium of natural isotopic ratio at\n4.2 K; b, concentric tube heat exchanger; c, flushing tube; d,\npumped bath of He II at 1.2 K; e, rouge superleak; f, exit tube for\nisotopically purified \"He; g\" g2, g~, needle valves; h, pumping\ntube for bath, d; j, vacuum space; Q, heat input to create normal\nfluid flow.

Hendry and P.V.E. McClintock\nthrough a 100 mm i.d. pumping line by an Edwards\nEH1200 mechanical booster, backed by a ISC900 rotary\npump.\nTo monitor the operation of the purifier, carbon\nresistance thermometers are positioned just above and\njust below the cone, and at various positions along the\nflushing tube. Provision is made for the application of heat\nto the warm end of the flushing tube and directly to the\npumped bath, using the heaters ql and q2 (in Figure 6).\nThe isotopically purified liquid 4He leaves the\ncryostat through the exit tube (f) where it enters a\nstandard helium transfer siphon. The liquid is evaporated\nin a heated copper ballast volume at room temperature,\npasses through the small rotary pump that is used to\ninduce the flow, and enters a 4.5 m3 flexible reservoir. At\nintervals, helium from the latter is compressed into a bank\nof standard gas bottles, to a maximum pressure of 1800\npsi, by means of a Williams and James Triquad compres-\nsor. The latter has been modified slightly so that gas from\nthe stage unloaders is returned to the laboratory helium\nrecovery system but, otherwise, is exactly as provided by\nthe manufacturers.\nIn an earlier version of the purifier, provision was\nmade for collection of the extracted 3He in a small copper\npot immersed within the helium in the pumped bath (d in\nFigure 6) in place of the present restriction (k). The\n3He-enriched product was extracted via the guide tube (p)\nleading to needle valve g4' This arrangement had the\ndisadvantage that, when the system was closed down\novernight with g4 closed, while being kept at 4 K ready for\na resumption of production on the foil lowing dai> any\nsmall leak in g4 would have enabled the collected He to\nleak back into the flushing tube. While any such inadver-\ntent contamination of the system should have cleared\nrapidly when the heat flush was re-established, it was felt\nto be undesirable. The quantities of 3He collected were, in\nany case, small. In the present version of the purifier,\nextracted 3He is removed continuously through the\ncapillary restriction (k); no significant 3He enrichment\noccurs, therefore, in any part of the system during\noperation.\nFigure 7 Photograph of the lower portion of the isotopic\npurification cryostat insert, with the vacuum can removed. The\npumped 4He bath (d in Figure 6) is visible on the left of the\npicture; two sleeved sections of the flushing tube can be seen in\nthe middle and towards the right (e in Figure 6); and one of the\nneedle valves (g2 in Figure 6) is shown on the extreme right. The\nconcentric tube heat exchanger (b in Figure 6) is coiled around\nthe whole assembly inside the vacuum can, except for the\nneedle valve connecting tubes which, for convenience of\nassembly and repair, lie outside the heat exchanger\noccurring within the flushing tube (c in Figure 6). The\nlatter consists of a 2 m length of 14 mm i.d., 16 mm o.d.\ncopper tube. To enable it to fit within the vacuum can, it is\ndivided into six separate lengths, connected by wide-bore\njunction pieces. The encircling sleeves on the individual\nsections of flushing tube are of 17 mm i.d., 19 mm o.d.\ncopper, connected together by short lengths of 3 mm o.d.\ncupro-nickel tube. The concentric tube heat exchanger (f)\nis made up from a 3 m length of 3 IIlm o.d. cupro-nickel\ntubing inside 5 mm o.d., 0.2 mm wall, cupro-nickel\ntubing.\nThe pumped helium bath consists of a 38 mm i.d.\nstainless steel tube, closed at the bottom by the wide end\nof the copper cone (I) alluded to above. This bath can be\nfilled continuously: either through the part-closed needle\nvalve (g3) from the main helium reservoir; or through\nneedle valve g4 via a restriction (k) with slightly 3He-\nenriched liquid helium from within the narrow end of the\ncone. The restriction consists of = 350 mm of nominally\n0.3 mm i.d. cupro-nickel, this length being chosen such\nthat its impedance is suitable for maintenance of the\nhelium level within the bath of He II (d) under steady\nstate circulation. The liquid level within the bath is\nmonitored by a capacitance depth gauge. The bath is filled\ninitially through g3 which is subsequently closed off again\nonce normal operation has been established. It is pumped\nThe operating procedure used for the purifier, in outline,\nis as follows. The device is leak tested at room tempera-\nture and at 77 K; its dewar is filled with liquid helium;\nthermal exchange gas in the vacuum space (j in Figure 6) is\npumped out; the bath (d) is filled through needle valve g3;\nit is then pumped towards 1.2 K while, at the same time,\nthe carbon resistance thermometers are calibrated against\n4He vapour pressure. The needle valve g\\ is then opened,\nadmitting liquid helium to the flushing tube and cone.\nAt this stage, even in the absence of fluid flow\nthrough the purification system, there is a large static heat\nload on the pot (d) most of which arises from conduction\nthrough the columns of liquid in the concentric tube heat\nexchanger (b). The heat load becomes even larger once\nflow has been initiated, but admission of liquid via the\nrestriction and valve g4 is sufficient to maintain an\napproximately constant level within the He II bath (d). On\nfirst starting the flow, the pressure at the room tempera-\nture end of the siphon in the exit tube (f) undergoes large\nfluctuations, probably corresponding to the initial cooling\ndown of the inside of the siphon. After a few minutes,\nhowever, the system settles down to a steady state with a\nflow of 3.3 m3h-1 (the speed of the small rotary pump that\ndraws gas through the system) of gas at STP. The pressure\nFigure 7: Photograph of the lower portion of the isotopic purification cryostat insert,\nwith the vacuum can removed. The pumped 4He bath (d in Figure 6) is visible on the\nleft of the picture; two sleeved sections of the flush g tube can be seen in the middle and\ntowards the right (e in Figure 6); and one of the needle valves (g2 in Figure 6) is shown\non the extreme right. The concentric tube heat exchanger (b in Figure 6) is coiled around\nthe whole as embly inside the vacuum can, xcept for he needle valve connecting tubes\nwhich, for convenience of assembly and repair, lie outside the heat exchanger.\n23\ndifference between the main 4He both at 4.2 K and the\noutlet of the exit siphon settles at = 104 Pa. The first few\ncubic metres of isotopically purified product are used to\npurge air and other contaminants from the rotary pump,\ncompressor, reservoir, bottles and gas handling system;\ncollection and storage of the isotopically purified 4He\ncommences once the purifier has been running in a steady\nstate for = 1 h.\nIt is of interest to try to establish the magnitude of\nthe heat current in the flushing tube, to ensure that the\noperating point of the system lies well above the dashed\nline of Figure 2. An a priori calculation, based on the\ndimensions of the system, would be extremely difficult on\naccount of the complicated nature of heat flow in He II;\nand particularly given that there are continuous columns\nof liquid extending from a region at 1.2 K to one at 4.2 K,\nwith T).. somewhere in the concentric tube heat exchanger.\nWe can, however, make an experimental estimate of the\nheat current, by measurement of the Kapitza temperature\ndiscontinuities at the copper cone. The temperature\ndifference, ~ T, across the cone is, in practice, small, so we\nmay assume the two discontinuities are approximately\nequal. Then\nwhere: K R is the Kapitza resistance; A is the surface area of\none side of the cone; Qo is the heat current arising .through\nconduction from the main helium reservoir; and Q I is the\nimposed heat current applied by energizing the heater\n(q,). The precise value of KR for the (probably highly\noxidized) surfaces of the copper cone is subjt;ct to\nconsiderable uncertainty, but we can esta~lish Qu by\nmeasurement of ~ T for a range of values of Q I, as shown\nin Figure 8. These measurements were made in the\nabsence of circulation, with the He II bath (d) maintained\nat a constant temperature by adjustments to the power\ndissipated in a second heater (q2) positioned above the\ncone. From Equation (13) it is clear that the graph should\nbe a straight line whose abscissa intercept yields directly at\na value of - Qo. From a number of plots, such as that in\nFigure 8, fitting straight lines to the data by the method of\nleast squares, we have concluded that the static heat load\non the pot is\nThe quoted uncertain~y probably reflects a variation in the\nabsolute value of Qo, corresponding to the gradual\ndecrease in the temperature of the main helium reservoir\nt)\"Jat took place between helium fills. The derived value of\nQo is consistent with the measured evaporation rate from\nthe He II bath (d) with n.eedle valves g3 and gl closed off.\nThe heat current, QF, in the presence of a mass flow\nwas estimated in a similar manner. Under standard\noperating conditions, with a throughput of 3.3 STP m3\nh -1, the heat current in the flushing tube was found to be\nThe corresponding temperature gradient along the\nflushing tube was extremely small, the temperature\ndifference between its ends being 10 \u00b1 2 mK.\nIt is evident that, even with the static heat load\nalone, the purifier functions within the region of safe\noperation, well above the dashed line in Figure 2; under\nsteady flow conditions, the heat flux close to the bottom of\nthe cone is = 104 W m-I , equivalent to a point close to the\ntop of the figure. It seems unlikely, therefore, that any\n4 861 (10-1 W)\nFigure 8 Measured temperature difference, 6 T, across the\ncopper cone (I in Figure 6), plotted as a function of the heater\npower, 0\" applied to the flushing tube (at heater q, in Figure 6)\nfor a bath temperature of 1.22 K\n3He is able to enter the flushing tube itself. Rather, it will\nbe flushed straight up into the cone as soon as it emerges\nfrom the inlet tube from the sleeve and enters the normal\nfluid current. The provision of a long flushing tube is,\nhowever, a valuable guard against inadvertent contamina-\ntion of the product as a consequence of the mechanical\ninstabilities that occur during the start-up period and that\nmay also occur when any of the operating parameters is\nchanged.\nSamples taken from the gas bottles after completion of a\nrroduction run were analysed by mass spectrometry. The\nHe content was found to be undetectable, implying that\nX3 < 2 X 10-10 Further samples of the gas were then\nreconcentrated in the miniature isotopic concentrator\nalready described 'I. This procedure would have enhanced\nthe concentration of any \"He that was present by a factor\nof almost 500. A sample of the resultant concentrate was\nsent for analysis and, again, it was found that the 3He\ncontent was undetectable. We conclude, therefore, that\nthe isotopic ratio of the 4He from the purifier was < 5 x\n10-13\nThese results are consistent with our belief, based on\nthe use of Equation \\1), that the helium emerging from the\npurifier is devoid of' He; but there is, of course, no means\nof proving that this is in fact the case.\nHelium from the purifier (or from its earlier\nvariants) has already been employed successfully for\nexperiments on quantum evaporation23, on the cyclotron\nresonance of ions at a He [f surface24, and on the\ndownscattering and containment of ultra-cold neutrons25,\nas well as in support of the Lancaster research programme\non 4He superfluidity26-2~ for which the device was original-\nly developed.\nFigure 8: Measured temperature diff rence, \u2206T , across the copper cone (l in Figure 6),\nplotted as a function of the heater power, Q\u02d9 applied to the flushing tube (at heater q1 in\nFigure 6) for a bath temperature of 1.22 K\n24\n"}
