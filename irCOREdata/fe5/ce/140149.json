Introduction\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is an adapta-\ntion of low-coherence interferometry (LCI). LCI was\ndeveloped for noncontact surface profiling [1\u20133],\nwhereas OCT refers to the same technique applied\nto subsurface imaging of semitransparent materials.\nThe LCI technique comprises an interferometer,\nused with a broadband light source, in which one\nof the reflectors is replaced by the sample of interest\nand the other, known as the reference reflector, scans\nrapidly and linearly over a short distance parallel\nto the optical axis of the system, to modulate the in-\nterferometer path-length difference. Interference\nfringes are generated when paths within the system\nmatch to within the source coherence length, which\nis typically a few micrometers to a few tens of micro-\nmeters, thereby providing a relative measurement\nof distance to the sample surface. The depth resolu-\ntion of the technique is thus set by the temporal\ncoherence of the broadband optical source. Two-\ndimensional (2D) and three-dimensional information\nis obtained by scanning the interrogating beam\nacross the surface of the sample. In recent years,\nOCT has generated enormous interest [4,5], particu-\nlarly for imaging biological tissue, since subsurface\nstructures of the sample are imaged with a very high\nspatial resolution. An alternative implementation of\nthe OCT technique is now generally preferred, in\nwhich the path-length difference is fixed and a laser\nsource, with a coherence length of a few centimeters,\nsweeps rapidly and linearly in wavelength over a\nrange of about 100nm. Swept-source systems allow\nfast acquisition, and the image contrast is often bet-\nter than in time-domain systems [6]. The image in\nswept-source OCT is generated from a fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) of data acquired by sampling the\ninterferometer output many times during the laser\nsweep [7].\nOCT in turbid biological tissue, both in vitro and\nin vivo, is finding widespread applications in the di-\nagnosis and treatment of medical problems, particu-\nlarly disorders of the internal structures of the eye [8]\nand cancers of the epithelial tissues of the human\nbody [9,10]. For internal investigations, such as mea-\nsurements of the gastrointestinal tract, endoscopic\nsystems using optical fiber components have been\ndeveloped [11]. Typically, these use one of two tech-\nniques to obtain 2D images; either a right-angle\nprism rotates within the probe, turning the beam\n0003-6935\/11\/050627-14$15.00\/0\n\u00a9 2011 Optical Society of America\n10 February 2011 \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 627\nthrough 90\u00b0 and sweeping it in a circle concentric\nwith the probe axis [12], or a miniaturized scanning\nmirror (or microelectromechanical system device) is\nincorporated within the probe to allow greater choice\nover the scanning direction [13].\nWe have developed swept-source LCI\/OCT sys-\ntems, incorporating one or more optical fiber imaging\nbundles within an endoscopic probe. By coupling\nlight into different fibers within the imaging bundle,\nmultiple points on the sample surface are addressed\nwithout any scanning at the probe end of the system.\nOur interest in low-coherence systems arises from\nconsideration of the requirements for endoscopic\nimaging in clinical OCT applications, but there are\nalso numerous nonbiological situations requiring\nnoninvasive thickness measurements or internal\nstructural analysis, for which OCT is a good candi-\ndate. These include, for example, subsurface investi-\ngation of resin composites [14], manufacture of sheet\nmaterials [15], and art conservation projects [16].\nThe introduction of imaging fiber bundles to OCT\nsystems allows a completely passive endoscopic\nprobe section to be constructed. Our first publication\nproposing imaging bundles for use in OCT [17] was\npublished almost simultaneously with another paper\non the same subject [18] in 2005. The work discussed\nin both these papers was based on time-domain\nsystems. We investigated an 800nm OCT system\nin which all fibers of an imaging bundle were illumi-\nnated simultaneously, the signal being collected on a\nCCD camera [19]. While partially successful, this\nsystem was slow because the camera frame rate\nwas only 25Hz. Phase drift during the acquisition\ntime was problematic, as were large variations of in-\ntensity across the image. In recent years a number of\nother researchers have also reported bundle-based\nOCT systems. A common-path Fourier-domain sys-\ntem has been described [20], and work has been\nreported on removal of the image pixelation effect\nresulting from the optical dead space between fiber\ncores in the bundle [21].\nTo the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first\nreport of a bundle-based OCT system using swept-\nsource processing. It describes a scheme in which a\nfocused beam is scanned across the input face of\nthe bundle to address each fiber in turn. The infor-\nmation from the different fibers is multiplexed in\ntime. Although transverse scanning components are\nrequired for this technique, they are removed to\nthe input end of the instrument, remote from the\nmeasurement region. The leached imaging bundles\nused in this investigation, described in detail below,\nhave outer diameters of only 1\u20133mm and are extre-\nmely flexible, making them highly appropriate for\nendoscopic applications. In principle, the removal\nof active beam-scanning components from the endo-\nscopic head allows very small probe diameters to be\nachieved, especially if Gradient-index (GRIN)-rod\nlenses are incorporated into the probe end. The re-\nmoval of scanning from the probe would be advanta-\ngeous in situations where access is difficult, such as\ninternal OCT measurements on live patients, or in\nengineering environments where it is preferable\nnot to introduce electrical signals, such as measure-\nments near inflammable or explosive gases. Themin-\niature scanning components required for integration\ninto an endoscopic OCT probe head are expensive\nand the experimental design can be awkward, result-\ning in larger probe dimensions than may be tolerated\nfor some applications. Such probes are typically side\nviewing [11], requiring the sample surface to be posi-\ntioned to the side of the probe and perpendicular to\nthe optical axis. The use of bundles, however, would\nallow both side-viewing and forward-viewing config-\nurations to be designed with only minor changes re-\nquired in the probe-head optics. This paper explores\nthe characteristics of three optical configurations for\nswept-source OCT using fiber imaging bundles.\n2. Optical and Data Acquisition Systems\nFigure 1 shows one of the configurations investigated\nfor a swept-source OCT system incorporating a fiber\nimaging bundle. Light from the swept source\nemerges via a single-mode fiber, which is connected\nto a broadband optical circulator using fiber connec-\ntors, angle polished to avoid backreflections into the\nlaser. The circulator delivers the laser output, minus\nlosses, to the bundle input optics. A pair of lenses\nfocuses the light to a small beam waist appropriate\nfor coupling into a single core of the bundle, and a\nrotating mirror mounted on a galvanometer scanner\nscans the beam across the input face of the bundle.\nIf paired galvo-scanners are used, a 2D region of\nthe sample can be addressed. The optics used are\ndescribed in greater detail below.\nThe figure shows a common-path system [22], in\nwhich both probe and reference beams travel identi-\ncal paths through the bundle at all times. Light from\nthe output of the bundle is focused onto a mirror, and\nthe OCT interferometer is formed by positioning a\nbeam splitter cube in the focused probe beam, to di-\nvert a portion of the optical power onto the surface of\nthe sample. We used a custom broadband beam split-\nter with a nominal 80% reflection\/20% transmis-\nsion, to direct most of the light onto the sample. In\nFig. 1. Configuration 1. Swept-source, common-path OCT system\nincorporating an imaging fiber bundle, with miniature Michelson\ninterferometer formed at output of bundle.

The path-length difference is set to be less\nthan the instantaneous coherence length of the laser,\nsuch that the two returning beams combine interfer-\nometrically. The lateral resolution scales linearly\nwith themagnification at the probe end of the sample\nbundle; for a magnification of 1, it is 10:6 \u03bcm, the\nsame as the core spacing. Axial resolution, calculated\nfrom the center wavelength of 1280nm and wave-\nlength sweep of 90nm, is about 8 \u03bcm.\nThe source used in this system is a Santec HSL-\n2000 scanning laser with a center wavelength of\n1330nm, a wavelength scanning rate of 20kHz, and\na wavelength sweep of about 100nm, which is very\nclose to linear as a function of time. The slight devia-\ntion from nonlinearity is well characterized [23] and\nhas been corrected for in the data. The maximum in-\nstantaneous power from the laser fiber pigtail is\nabout 13mW, occurring close to 1350nm. The optical\nsignal, returning from the OCT system through the\ncirculator, is incident on a fiber-coupled, low-noise\nInGaAs photodetector, with a 3dB bandwidth of\n15MHz and an output response of 51 \u00d7 103 V=W.\nData acquisition is performed by a National Instru-\nments PXI-5122 digitizer card, mounted in an exter-\nnal chassis and controlled from a personal computer\nby NI-SCOPE LabVIEW software. The analog inputs\nto the digitizer are converted to a 14 bit digital signal,\nwith a maximum sampling rate of 100MSs\u22121. The\nrepeat period of the laser wavelength sweep is 50 \u03bcs,\nwith a duty cycle of about 80%. For an imaging depth\nof 2mm in air, applying the Nyquist sampling criter-\nion, it is necessary to collect more than 450 samples\nwithin the sweep period, or 600\u2013800 for the same\ndepth in a high-index sample. In our system, data\npoints are sampled at equal wavelength intervals.\nThe Fourier transform required to extract spatial\ninformation requires data points equally spaced in\noptical frequency, for which resampling of the data\nis required. Given the 20kHz sweep rate of the laser,\nwe use an acquisition rate of 33MSs\u22121, which re-\nsults in data sets of about 1350 values per sweep.\nResampled sets of 800 points, equally positioned in\nfrequency space, are then calculated.\nA batch of typically 600 data sets is collected dur-\ning each mirror scan, containing the information to\ngenerate one 2D image of 600 \u00d7 400 pixels. The batch\nstart time is synchronized to the rotational position\nof the mirror by a signal from the mirror controller,\ndriven by a sawtooth waveform generated either\nfrom the computer or an external source. Within this\nbatch, acquisition of each data set is triggered by a\nTTL output pulse from the laser.\nAC frequencies higher than half the sampling rate,\ni.e., 16:5MHz, present at the analog input connector,\ngive rise to aliased frequencies in the digitized sig-\nnal, and are best discarded before the digitization\nprocess takes place. Thus the 15dB bandwidth of\nthe detector used here is well suited to measurement\nat the 33MHz sampling rate.\n3. Properties of Imaging Fiber Bundles\nCoherent optical fiber bundles, also known as imag-\ning bundles, comprise typically tens of thousands of\nwaveguiding glass or plastic cores surrounded by\nlower index material. Ideally, each fiber is considered\nto act as an independent waveguide, the whole array\nbeing contained within a diameter up to a few milli-\nmeters. Because fiber positions match at both ends of\nthe bundle, an image projected onto the input face is\ntransmitted unaltered to the output end. This is de-\nmonstrated by Fig. 2(a); an illuminated sheet of\nletter \u201ce\u201d stencils is imaged, with a magnification\nM \u2248 0:02, onto the input face of an imaging bundle,\nand the output face is then imaged, with a magnifi-\ncationM \u2248 6 onto a CCD camera. Imaging fiber bun-\ndles are manufactured both in silica and in crown\nglass [24]. There are several types: the illuminated\nend face of a wound bundle is shown, at a magnifica-\ntion of aboutM \u2248 40, in Fig. 2(b). This type is made by\nwinding subbundles of 5 \u00d7 5 fibers into a single-layer\nribbon on a cylindrical mandrel, assembling layers\nin a separate laminating operation, then cutting\nthrough and polishing the ends [25]. These bundles\ntypically have a diameter of 4\u201310mm, and have been\nsuccessfully used in flow measurement [26,27] and\nspeckle [28] instrumentation applications in our\nlaboratory. Fused bundles [Fig. 2(c)], in which the\nmatrix of cores and cladding is solid along the entire\nlength, are also available [29]. These typically have\ncore diameters of a few micrometers, but are much\nFig. 2. CCD camera views of bundle end faces, under white-light transmission. (a) Image of a sheet of stencils (one \u201ce\u201d partially rubbed\naway), transmitted through a leached bundle. The magnification in this image is a factor of \u223c5 lower than in the previous three, but the\nhexagonal pattern of individual fiber cores can still just be distinguished.

Also, we were unable\nto locate either wound or fused bundles in which it\nwas possible to confine near-infrared (NIR) light to\na single core over the length of the bundle.\nLeached bundles [Fig. 2(d)] are manufactured by\nlaying up rigid, double-clad core rods in a close-\npacked array, such that any particular core occupies\nthe same position in the matrix at both ends of the\nbundle [30]. The entire assembly is then fused and\ndrawn to reduce the core diameters. Over the entire\nbundle, apart from lengths of about 1 cm at either\nend, the outer layer of cladding is removed from each\ncore by acid leaching, separating the fibers and ren-\ndering the bundle extremely flexible, and the faces of\nthe short, rigid end sections are polished to obtain an\noptically flat finish [31]. Figure 3(a) illustrates the\nstructure.\nMany of the commercially available leached bun-\ndles have core diameters of up to several tens of mi-\ncrometers, and a high degree of multimoding is to be\nexpected within the fibers. This is not a problem for\ndirect visualization of a white-light image by the eye,\nbut does make such bundles unsuitable for use with\nlaser sources and interferometric systems. Hence\nleached bundles, with much smaller core diameters\nof 6\u201312 \u03bcm (Schott North America), were selected\nfor this investigation. The actual bundles used had\na core center spacing, or pixel size, of 10:6 \u03bcm, as\nshown in Fig. 3(b).\nIncorporating an imaging bundle into an OCT sys-\ntem creates challenges additional to those found in\nsingle-fiber OCT. The numerical aperture (NA) of\nbundles is generally at least 0.5 in the visible region\nof the spectrum, much greater than the value of 0.1\u2013\n0.15 typical for single-mode fibers. This results from\nthe need to confine the light adequately to an indivi-\ndual core surrounded by only a very thin layer of\ncladding, so that cross coupling between fibers is\nminimized. For typical core diameters, the result is\nmultimode guiding behavior at wavelengths in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Wavelengths used\nfor OCT are typically in the range of 400\u20131500nm,\nwith most being between 800 and 1300nm. The bun-\ndle NA and number of modes supported in the NIR\nwill be lower than in the visible but, as described be-\nlow, a degree of multimode behavior persists up to at\nleast 1400nm. A high NA creates a number of issues.\nFirst, light must be delivered to and from the fiber\nbundle, and to the detector, using single-mode fiber\ncomponents, such as couplers. The NA of these is\npoorly matched to the bundle NA, which inevitably\nleads to optical losses unless coupling to the bundle\ncan be very carefully controlled, to excite only the\nfundamental mode of each core. Similarly, at the\nsample end of the OCT probe, it is desirable for\nthe beam to have a rather small value of NA, to en-\nsure sufficient depth of focus; too small a Rayleigh\nrange results in excessive loss of contrast and lateral\nresolution away from the best-focus position in the\nOCT image. If more than one bundle mode is excited,\nNA matching here will again be poor.\nMultimoding occurs then, even when bundles\ndesigned for the visible spectrum are used at wave-\nlengths in the NIR. It is clearly very undesirable in\nan OCT system. Modes excited in addition to the\nfundamental will travel different path lengths with-\nin the bundle core, giving rise to unwanted signals in\nthe OCT image. Provided that the difference in opti-\ncal path length for two modes is within the instanta-\nneous coherence length of the laser (about 10\u201320mm\nfor the Santec laser used here), then wavelength-\ndependent interference will occur between those\nmodes, causing the output to oscillate. The frequency\nof oscillation will depend upon the fiber length and\ndispersion characteristics.\nThe modes excited in any particular core are af-\nfected by the coupling conditions [32]. The center\nwavelength of the swept source is considerably high-\ner than the visible wavelengths for which the bundle\nis designed, which immediately reduces the number\nof supported modes. In addition, a low NA coupling\nlens, an incident beam well aligned normal to the\nbundle input face, and centering of the beam focus\nFig. 3. (a) Construction of a leached fiber bundle, (b) hexagonal close-packed arrangement of fiber cores in the rigid end ferrules.\n630 APPLIED OPTICS \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ 10 February 2011\nwithin the selected core, will result in near-single-\nmode behavior. However, it is not possible to ensure\nthat these conditions apply at all times when scan-\nning the input beam across the bundle face to access\nmany bundle cores rapidly and sequentially.\nBecause the cladding thickness is very small com-\npared with conventional fibers, some overlap of mod-\nal fields between cores is to be expected, particularly\nin the rigid end ferrules of the bundle [Fig. 3], where\nthe fibers are hexagonally close packed and cores lie\nparallel in a matrix of cladding material over dis-\ntances of several millimeters. As a result, a fraction\nof optical power will be coupled from the illuminated\ncore into several neighboring cores. The degree of\npower transfer depends on the quality of phase\nmatching between the two waveguides involved in\nthe process; for identical fibers, power transfer could,\nin principle, be total over a sufficient interaction\nlength, giving rise to severe cross-talk problems in\nthe signal. In fused bundles, modeling has shown\n[33] that diameter variations occurring over distance\nwithin the bundle are helpful in providing a limita-\ntion on interaction length, and keeping the light lar-\ngely confined to the core illuminated at the bundle\ninput. In leached bundles of the type used for these\nexperiments, diameter variations are very small, but\nthe fibers lie in a loose skein outside the end ferrules\nof the bundle, which also places a limitation on\ncoupling interaction length. However, because the\ncladding is only about 2 \u03bcm thick, it is possible that\nsignificant overlap of modal fields occurs even within\nthe region of the bundle where the fibers are physi-\ncally separated from one another by etching, in which\ncase additional cross-coupling effects will occur.\nA fill-factor loss of around 40% is generally quoted\nfor imaging bundles. When the entire bundle face is\nilluminated at one time, as in typical visual inspec-\ntion applications, light that falls in the regions\nbetween fiber cores is lost. It should be noted that\nthis loss operates differently in the proposed OCTap-\nplication. For ideal input coupling, the entire avail-\nable power from the beam addresses individual\nbundle fibers, but there is a total loss of data when\nthe beam addresses regions within the cladding. This\nresults in discretization of the image data. In these\nexperiments, a powermeter has been used to mea-\nsure the transmission loss experienced when cou-\npling to a single bundle core. The value obtained is,\nof course, dependent on the quality of input coupling.\nFor an input NA of about 0.15, a maximum transmis-\nsion of about 17% was obtained in a 1:35m long bun-\ndle at 1330nm.\nTransmission information is provided by the man-\nufacturer [34] for wavelengths up to 1100nm, as\nshown in Fig. 4. Maximum transmission occurs at\nabout 500nm, with the value gradually declining\nas wavelength increases. Our measured value looks\nreasonable when compared with this curve. In a dou-\nble-pass arrangement, this equates to 97% loss of op-\ntical power in the bundle, which is a difficulty with\nthis approach at the present time. Shorter bundles\nare available: we also measured the transmission for\na 0:52m long bundle at the same input NA. The\nmeasurement was not directly comparable, as the\npixel size for this bundle was only 8:4 \u03bcm, compared\nwith 10:6 \u03bcm for the longer bundle. However, an\nincreased transmission of 27% was observed. The\ndouble-pass loss for this bundle is therefore 93%.\nIt seems likely that the dominant loss mechanism\nis leakage from the cladding over the length of the\nFig. 4.

Bundles in an OCT System\nA. Lens Arrangements for Input and Output Coupling\nThe optimum input coupling arrangement for the\nbundle is to place the scanning mirror in the front\nfocal plane of the coupling lens [Fig. 5(a)]. The chief\nray within the focused beam then remains perpendi-\ncular to the bundle end face at all scan positions. This\nalso ensures that the position of best focus is the\nsame for all fibers in the bundle. For the scanning\nmirror at longer distances from this lens, poor beam\nfocus and increased excitation of higher-order modes\nare experienced by fiber cores toward the extremes of\nthe scan. Short focal length, aspheric lenses\n(Thorlabs, Inc.) were used in our system to keep the\narrangement compact, and the design enabled all\ncomponents to be mounted within a small bench\nfootprint.\nAt the distal end of the bundle, similar considera-\ntions apply to the selection of lenses. A telecentric\nimaging system [Fig. 5(b)] is desirable, particularly\nwhere the reference beam is derived from this end\nof the probe, to ensure that the chief ray in the sam-\nple beam is parallel to the optical axis of the system\nfor all image positions. This is not difficult to arrange\non the laboratory bench, but requires lens L4 to have\na clear aperture of 3\u20136mm in diameter when used at\na magnification of 2\u20133, and is therefore not so suita-\nble when the system is designed for endoscopic appli-\ncations in confined spaces. The depth of focus within\nthe sample depends on beam NA; an acceptable\nRayleigh range would be about 100\u2013200 \u03bcm, which\nrequires the NA to be about 0.07\u20130.05 at a wave-\nlength of 1330nm. This would provide reasonable\nimaging quality to a sample depth of more than\n1mm. If suppression of higher-order modes is\nachieved at the input, the output NA of the beamwill\nbe less than the standard value quoted for the bun-\ndle, but insufficiently low for good OCT imaging.\nUsing an NIR CCD camera (Vosskh\u00fchler NIR-300\nInGaAs sensor, 320 \u00d7 256 array of 30 \u03bcm square pix-\nels), the output NA of light transmitted by a single\ncore of the bundle was measured for input NA values\nranging from about 0.15\u20130.55, close to the center of\nthe mirror scan. In all cases, the NA of the output\nlight was similar, with values ranging between about\n0.12 and 0.15. This suggests that only a few modes\nare excited at these wavelengths, with most of the\nlight propagating in the fundamental mode.\nThe modal patterns are most clearly observed un-\nder monochromatic illumination, thus, a fiber Bragg\ngrating fabricated in our laboratories (wavelength\n1301nm, 40% reflectivity) was used to select a 0:2nm\nwide slice from the swept-source output. This light\nwas coupled, with an input NA of about 0.5, into a\nsingle-fiber core, and themodal pattern at the bundle\noutput was observed by imaging the core of interest\nonto the CCD camera. Representative results are\npresented in Figs. 6(a)\u20136(d), along with profiles\ntaken horizontally through the center of each\nimage, for four slightly different coupling conditions\n[Figs. 6(e)\u20136(h)]. The gain is not the same for all\nthese images; maximum optical power is transmitted\nin the situation depicted in Fig. 6(a).\nWhen the beam is optimally focused and the beam\nwaist concentrically aligned with the fiber [Figs. 6(a)\nand 6(e)], the output appears very similar to that of a\nsingle-mode fiber, with coupled power at a maximum\nand the profile of the mode almost Gaussian in form.\nHowever, a few micrometers of defocus or lateral off-\nset causes some of the power to couple into higher-\norder modes. Only a few modes appear to be excited\nFig. 6. (a)\u2013(d) Near-field modal patterns (M \u2248 100) and (e)\u2013\n(h) horizontal profiles through the center of each image, showing\nthe effect of input coupling conditions on modal population for a\nsingle core of fiber bundle.\n632 APPLIED OPTICS \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ 10 February 2011\nto any appreciable extent under the coupling condi-\ntions experienced as the beam scans across the bun-\ndle, but even this small fraction of power traveling in\nother modes will cause artifacts and loss of signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) in the OCT images.\nSome additional power loss is to be expected in the\nprobe-end optics, in reducing the NA to a value ap-\npropriate for sample imaging. In single-fiber OCT\nsystems, the region addressed on the sample surface\nis independent of the probe lenses, being determined\nby the angular excursions of one or two galvanometer\nmirrors. In bundle-based OCT, however, the area\nsampled is determined by the input and output NA\nvalues of the lens system used to image the distal\nbundle face onto the sample, and this is coupled to\nthe magnification of the lens system. For a bundle\ndiameter of 1mm, a magnification M of about 2\nwould provide a reasonable sample dimension and\nan acceptable NA for the probe beam. It must be re-\nmembered that the number of sampling points (fiber\ncores) is fixed, so an increase in scan diameter on the\nsample implies an accompanying decrease in the lat-\neral resolution. For the highest resolution, the sam-\nple dimension imaged must be equal to or less than\nthe bundle diameter. For larger images, a bundle con-\ntaining a larger number of fiber cores should be used.\nAs magnification decreases, and lateral resolution\nincreases, it becomes necessary to include an aper-\nture stop to maintain depth of focus; however, a loss\nof optical power will be experienced, proportional to\nthe square of the NA reduction ratio in the focused\nsample beam, and it may sometimes be preferable\nsimply to accept a smaller imaging depth for high\nresolution images.\nGRIN-rod lenses are an attractive alternative to\nconventional lenses, as their small size and cylindri-\ncal form allow for ease of mounting and compact, ro-\nbust systems. GRIN-rod lenses generally have small\namounts of spherical aberration and astigmatism,\nand some field curvature [35,36]. Chromatic aberra-\ntion can be large, especially in the visible range, with\nfocal shifts of up to 15\u201320 \u03bcm over about 100nm,\nwhich imposes a limitation on depth resolution in ul-\ntrahigh resolution OCT systems, but this aberration\nis much lower in the NIR and performance is per-\nfectly adequate for low-coherence imaging in the type\nof system described here.\nB. Configuration 1: Bulk-Optic Michelson Interferometer at\nDistal End of Bundle\nSeveral configurations for bundle-based systems\nhave been investigated. Initially, the common-path\nsystem of Fig. 1 was used, in which a Michelson in-\nterferometer was formed using a 5mm beam splitter\ncube positioned at the distal end of the bundle. This\narrangement ensures polarization matching be-\ntween the signal and reference beams, maximizing\nsignal amplitude, and also ensures that both beams\nfollow identical paths through the bundle. As dis-\ncussed below, the resulting dispersion matching is\na significant advantage of the common-path scheme.\nThe lateral scanning of the reference beam that oc-\ncurs in this system is less advantageous. When a flat\nreference mirror is used, power is lost toward the ex-\ntremes of the scan due to increasing beam angle. The\nvariation in power transmitted through individual fi-\nbers is also very variable, depending on coupling con-\nditions at the bundle input. These effects make it\ndifficult, even partially, to remove the DC component\nof the OCT signal, thereby limiting attainable SNR.\nBackreflections from both ends of the fiber bundle\ncontribute significant DC levels to the detected sig-\nnal, raising the excess noise.\nBecause losses are high for beams traveling within\nthe bundle, the proximal face reflection was particu-\nlarly troublesome, so 12\u00b0 angled polishes were ap-\nplied at the input and output faces of the bundle.\nSnell\u2019s law at the glass\/air interface requires that\nthe fiber interface then be tilted away from the opti-\ncal axis. Setting the tilt angle of the bundle ends for\nmaximum coupling into the angle-polished cores re-\nquired care. There was also a loss of focus associated\nwith the angled polish, toward extremes of the beam\ntransit, both at the input and output of the bundle. At\nthe input end, this can beminimized by the use of low\nNA optics. In principle, it could be eliminated by\ntranslating the bundle end parallel to the polished\nsurface instead of beam scanning but, in practice,\ntranslation stages with hundreds of micrometers\nrange, >100Hz resonant frequencies and trajectory\nprecision of a few micrometers are very costly. Unfor-\ntunately, suppression of the backreflection from the\ndistal end was less successful, because of the multi-\nmode nature of the cores. There was a tendency for\nthe angled polish to couple backreflected light into\nhigher-order modes, which adversely affected the\nimages by increasing modal interference artifacts.\nPolishing the ends of the bundle normal to the\noptical axis, and having a V-type antireflection\n(AR) coating [37] applied (Vortex Optical Coatings\nLtd.), was found to be a helpful alternative to angle-\npolishing, reducing the reflectivity of the fiber ends to\nabout 0.004, from a value of about 0.05 for the un-\ncoated surfaces. A more sophisticated coating would\nfurther reduce this value, although an angled polish\nstill offers superior suppression at the beam input.\nC. Configuration 2: Michelson Interferometer Formed\nbetween Two Bundles\nTo avoid the reference beam scanning inevitable in\nthe common-path arrangement, the Michelson inter-\nferometer arrangement shown in Fig. 7(a) was also\ninvestigated. Initially, the reference arm comprised\na single-mode fiber of similar length to the imaging\nbundle, with path-length trimming achieved in the\nshort air paths at the distal ends of each arm. It was\nimmediately clear from this setup that the effective\nindex and dispersion of the single-mode fiber are\nvery different from that of the bundle cores; the\nwidth of the OCT signal became dependent on\nthe depth position within the image, and was sig-\nnificantly broadened for all depth positions. A\n10 February 2011 \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 633\nsatisfactory image could not be obtained. The single-\nmode reference fiber was therefore replaced by a sec-\nond imaging bundle of a type and length matching\nthe first. Using a single fiber within this bundle as\nthe guide for the reference beam resulted in a great\nimprovement in image quality. Of course, it is an ex-\npensive solution to place a second bundle in the re-\nference arm for the use of one fiber core. In principle,\nthe same result could be achieved by coupling the re-\nference beam into a peripheral fiber core of the main\nsample-arm bundle. This would be less straight-\nforward to arrange experimentally, but not prohibi-\ntively difficult.\nD. Configuration 3: Fizeau Interferometer at Distal\nEnd of Bundle\nFinally, a third arrangement was investigated\n[Fig. 7(b)], which is attractive because it requires\nno additional optical components within the probe.\nThe reference beam is derived from the internal re-\nflection at the distal end of each fiber core. The beam\nfrom the output of the bundle is allowed simply to\ndiverge until it strikes the sample. This technique\nhas been reported in single-fiber systems [19,38].\nAlthough the optical power does not converge to a\nbeam waist, if the sample is positioned close enough\nto the end of the bundle, the beam will still be small\nenough for adequate imaging. The reference beam is\nderived from the distal bundle face, which, for an\nuncoated bundle, has a reflectivity of about 5%. If\nrequired, a higher percentage of light can be trans-\nferred into the reference beam by appropriate coat-\ning of the bundle face. This OCT configuration\nrequires the object to be positioned very close to the\nend of the probe, as the maximum operating dis-\ntance, limited by beam defocus, is a few hundred\nmicrometers.\nBalanced detection is often used in OCT to remove\nexcess noise. Typical optical arrangements for single-\nfiber OCT systems are similar to Configuration 2\n(Subsection 4.C). In such systems, balanced detection\nis achieved by collecting both outputs from the Mi-\nchelson interferometer. The DC background common\nto both signals is largely removed, along with the ex-\ncess noise, and the interferometric, antiphase signals\ncombine additively. Although, in principle, the same\ntechnique can be applied in bundle-based systems, it\nis complicated by the multimode behavior of the bun-\ndle fiber cores. Unless all light from the returned sig-\nnal in each multimode bundle core couples to the\ncollection fiber of the detector, which is not generally\nthe case, balanced detection will not be completely\nsuccessful, as the coupling at this point will be wave-\nlength dependent. Multimode collection fibers can be\nused with the balanced detector, but the photodetec-\ntor dimension is only 0:1mm, and similar problems\noccur if not all the power from the multimode fiber\nis transferred to the active detector area.\nPartial removal of the DC signal component can be\nachieved in our system by splitting off a small portion\nof the output from the swept source using a 95=5 di-\nrectional coupler, collecting the light on the second\ninput of the balanced detector, and attenuating this\nbeam until its magnitude closely matches that of the\nDC level in the OCT signal beam. In practice, how-\never, little improvement in image quality is observed,\nbecause the detection limits of the system are domi-\nnated at present by image artifacts resulting from\nFig. 7.

If multimod-\ning were eliminated, detector or excess noise would\nbecome dominant, and DC reduction would then be\nmore helpful. Reduction of excess noise is also af-\nfected by the interferometer arrangement used, and\nalso depends on the extent to which the front-face\nreflection from the bundle can be suppressed.\n5. Results and Discussion\nImages were acquired for the three imaging system\nconfigurations described in Section 4, and are shown\nin Figs. 8\u201310. The magnification for Configurations 1\nand 2 was arranged to be similar, to facilitate visual\ncomparison of images of the same sample taken with\ndifferent systems. In Configuration 3, unit magnifi-\ncation is intrinsic to the arrangement, since no addi-\ntional optics are employed in the probe section of the\ninstrument.\nA. Configuration 1: Bulk-Optic Michelson Interferometer at\nDistal End of Bundle\nThe images shown in Fig. 8 exhibit a feature charac-\nteristic to all bundle-based low-coherence systems.\nBecause of the \u201cdead space\u201d in the nonguiding clad-\nding region between fibers, images have a vertically\nstriped appearance, with bright lines corresponding\nto illuminated bundle fiber cores.\nThe magnification in this system was 2.4. The low-\ncoherence interferometer was formed by including a\nbeam splitter cube in the probe section of the system,\nto create two beam paths. The reference beam is\nbackreflected from a mirror, and the sample is posi-\ntioned at the focus of the other beam. By placing the\nbeam splitter after the focusing optics, the number of\nlenses required is minimized, and the beam paths to\nthe focal planes are automatically matched in the\ntwo arms. It should be noted that the cube has the\neffect of shifting the focal plane back by a distance\nof about 3:5mm, as compared with the same system\nwithout a beam splitter; this must be accounted for\nduring system setup. In our system, a beam splitter\nwith a 70=20 power split ratio was used (approxi-\nmately 10% loss), such that the straight-through\n(reference) beam contained about 20% of the incident\npower, and the reflected (sample) beam about 70%.\nAfter the double pass through this component experi-\nenced by both beams, the ratio of power returning\nfrom the sample and reference arms would be about\n12:1 for equal reflectivity in each arm. Because, in\npractice, the reflectivity in the sample arm is typi-\ncally much lower than that in the reference arm,\nthe unequal split ratio helps to maximize efficient\nuse of the available light. The Michelson configura-\ntion allows the sample to be positioned to either side\nof the zero path-length difference position. In all the\nimages of Fig. 8, parts of the sample closest to the\nbundle appear toward the top of the image.\nThe prime advantage of Configuration 1 is the\ncommon-path arrangement. Reference and signal\nbeams travel the same route through the bundle.\nAlthough this does not eliminate modal problems,\nit does minimize dispersion broadening of the inter-\nference signal, and polarization matching is automa-\ntically achieved at all times in all fibers. The main\ndisadvantage is that the reference beam undergoes\nspatial scanning, which results in large intensity var-\niation in this beam, in addition to those in the sample\nbeam. Unless the telecentric probe lens arrangement\nof Fig. 5(b) is adopted, there will also be \u201cwalk-off\u201d of\nthe beam incident on the reference mirror toward the\nextremes of the scan. The effects of this can be seen in\nthe images shown in Figs. 8(a)\u20138(c). The central por-\ntion of the image is bright, but loss of power toward\nthe ends of the transverse scan means that this re-\ngion of the image may be lost. The problem is least\napparent in Fig. 8(a), where the sample is of very\nhigh reflectivity.\nB. Configuration 2: Michelson Interferometer Formed\nbetween Two Bundles\nThe images acquired using this system, shown in\nFig. 9, were of better quality in several ways than\nthose acquired using the system previously de-\nscribed. The telecentric probe lens system of\nFig. 5(b) was implemented, using lenses of f \u00bc 8\nand 18:4mm and it is clear, particularly from\nFig. 9(a), that fading toward the edge of the image\nhas been almost eliminated. It would similarly be\npossible to employ this lens system in Configuration\n1, with the beam splitter positioned after the second\nlens. The contrast is also better in the images shown\nin Fig. 9, because physical separation of the reference\nand signal arms allowed optimized input coupling for\nthe reference beam bundle to be achieved and main-\ntained through a single-fiber core, while only the sig-\nnal beam was scanned from one fiber to another. The\nmagnification of the system was 2.3. In Fig. 9(f), an\nimage acquired with the same source and electronics,\nbut using single-mode fibers with probe-end scan-\nning, is shown for comparison. The image demon-\nstrates that, with advances in appropriate bundle\nFig. 9. Images from system Configuration 2. The samples repre-\nsented are (a) a matte, milled metallic surface, (b) a sheet of trans-\nlucent stencil film, (c) the first few layers in a reel of adhesive tape,\nand (d), (e) a 680 \u03bcm-wide V-groove in a milled alloy block. A cor-\nrection has been applied to displayed depth positions in all images\nexcept for (d). About 60 fibers are used. White bars show 250 \u03bcm,\nwidth and depth scales. For comparison, a second image of the ad-\nhesive tape reel, acquired using our OCT systemwith a single fiber\nand a scanning mirror instead of the bundle, is shown in (f). The\ndepth scale for this image is as for the others, but the lateral dis-\ntance is greater at 6:5mm.\n10 February 2011 \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 635\ntransmission and modal characteristics, excellent\nimage quality is achievable in such a system.\nThere is one drawback of this configuration. The\nindividual optical paths for fibers within the bundle\nvary by a few tens of micrometers, even when the end\nfaces are polished flat and perpendicular to the bun-\ndle axis. This introduces a distortion of the acquired\nimage. Figure 9(d) shows an uncorrected image of a\n680 \u03bcm-wide V groove. However, it is reasonably\nstraightforward to correct for this distortion. A refer-\nence image taken from a flat surface is acquired. The\ndepth positions of the maxima are computed, stored,\nand subtracted from the corresponding depth values\nin each subsequent set of acquisitions. The images\nshown in Figs. 9(a)\u20139(c) and 9(e) have all been ad-\njusted using this correction. The reference data set\nis, of course, unique to the particular row of fiber\ncores used to acquire the 2D image, and must be\nrenewed if a different row of fibers is selected.\nC. Configuration 3: Fizeau Interferometer at\nDistal End of Bundle\nThis is the most straightforward system in terms of\noptical components and alignment. The light from\nthe source is coupled directly into the bundle, via the\ntransverse scanning mirror. At the probe end of\nthe bundle, no additional optics are required and\nthe magnification is therefore always 1.\nThe light exiting from the bundle is simply allowed\nto diverge until it strikes the sample, which is placed\nwithin a few hundred micrometers of the bundle tip.\nFocusing optics could be used at the end of the bun-\ndle, but the instantaneous coherence length of the\nSantec source is not large enough to permit this in\nour system. When a flat, matte-surface metallic sam-\nple is used as the sample, it appears that good imag-\ning is achieved, as seen in Fig. 10(a). However, this is\nrather surprising, since the beam divergence is sig-\nnificant and, at a distance of 500 \u03bcm from the bundle,\nthe beam diameter will be about 150 \u03bcm. This would\nbe expected to cause severe power losses and reduc-\ntion in transverse resolution. Indeed, when a more\ncomplex object is introduced, such as a 280 \u03bcm wide,\nmachined V-groove [Fig. 10(b)], it becomes clear that\ngood imaging is to be expected only for structures\nthat are almost parallel to the end face of the bundle.\nWithin the groove, where the path length changes\nappreciably over small lateral distances, the image\nbecomes smeared out. It is possible to see that a hol-\nlow exists in the sample structure, but the exact form\nof the structure is lost.\nThis experiment was performed using a bundle\nwith coated input and output faces. The reference re-\nflectivity was about 0.4%. It would be straightfor-\nward to achieve a reference reflectivity of 4%\u20135%,\nusing an uncoated glass interface, or a greater value\nby application of a high-reflectivity coating. Such a\nsystem could be used for thickness measurements,\nif the structures to be imaged are almost parallel\nto the bundle end face. A reasonable depth image was\nobtained, showing the first four layers within a reel\nof adhesive tape [Fig. 10(c)]. As in Configuration 1,\npolarization matching of signal and reference beams\nis automatic.\n6. Discussion of System Performance\nIn OCT, sample-arm reflectivity values are typically\naround 10\u22125\u201310\u22127, therefore, excellent signal-to-\nnoise performance is critical to achieving satisfactory\nimage contrast throughout the image depth. Opti-\nmum performance depends on reducing detector and\nexcess noise contributions to the point where the re-\nmaining shot noise is dominant. Detector noise is de-\npendent on gain and bandwidth, and will typically be\nfixed for a given acquisition system, so detector SNR\nis maximized by selection of a low-noise detector in\nthe first place, and then by maximizing the interfero-\nmetric OCT signal. There is generally no lack of re-\nference beam power but, for turbid sample materials,\nit is vital to maximize the much weaker coherent sig-\nnal from the sample arm. It is important for imaging\nthat reference beam power should be significantly\ngreater than sample beam power; otherwise, the im-\nage will be confused by signals resulting from inter-\nference between various sample-arm reflections. The\nabsolute magnitude of the interferometric signal can\nbe boosted by further increasing reference beam\npower, in a manner analogous to that used in refer-\nence beam laser anemometry [39]. However, excess\nnoise is proportional to the square of the mean DC\nsignal component. This means that, if excess and de-\ntector noise are similar in magnitude, the increase in\nexcess noise rapidly outweighs any improvement in\ndetector SNR due to the increased reference beam\ncomponent. Where balanced detection is used, much\nof the excess noise can be cancelled inMichelson-type\narrangements, but a beat noise component remains.\nExpressions for the various noise components are\nfound in many publications. We refer to one example\nFig. 10. Images from system shown in Configuration 3. The samples represented are (a) a matte, milled metallic surface, (b) a 280 \u03bcm-\nwide V-groove in a milled alloy block, and (c) the first few layers in a reel of adhesive tape. About 60 fibers are used. White bars show\n250 \u03bcm, width and depth scales.\n636 APPLIED OPTICS \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ 10 February 2011\n[40], with the magnitudes of the noise components\nadjusted for our different interferometer configura-\ntions. For the detector used in this project, the noise\nover the 3dB bandwidth, expressed as the variance\nof the current, is about 2:0 \u00d7 10\u221216A2. For Configura-\ntions 1 and 2, with optimal alignment, and using the\n70=20 beam splitter, a typical optical power of 10 \u03bcW\nis obtained at the detector from the reference arm of\nthe interferometer. If we assume that the maximum\nSNR is obtained when the signal power at the detec-\ntor equals the reference power, we can calculate a\nmean square OCT signal magnitude of about\n10\u221210 A2, a shot-noise variance of 4:8 \u00d7 10\u221217 A2 and,\nignoring polarization effects, an excess noise var-\niance of about 10\u221216 A2. These values are sometimes\nelevated by a relatively large residual front-face\nreflection from the bundle.\nHowever, imaging is also affected by artifacts re-\nsulting from other effects. First, the raw laser wave-\nlength profile is roughly sawtooth-shaped, although\nthis is modified in the OCT system by wavelength-\ndependent coupling and fiber losses. It also carries\nsome high-frequency structure, as shown in\nFig. 11(a), which is more significant toward the\nhigh-wavelength end of the sweep. These features\nlead to unwanted lines in the Fourier transform im-\nage in Fig. 11(d). Because the bundle loss is high,\ngreat care must be taken to avoid even much-\nattenuated backreflections from elements such as\nneutral density filters placed between the laser\nand the bundle. The front-face reflection from the\nbundle is a particular problem, as discussed above.\nA larger contribution to image artifacts comes from\noscillatory effects due to multimoding and cross cou-\npling in the bundle. Where these fall within the\nrange of expected OCT frequencies, a spurious struc-\nture will appear at the corresponding depth in the\nFFT image, and the magnitude of these artifacts\ncan be much larger than any of the noise sources\nin the system. Unwanted oscillations are present in\nthe output when light is coupled into a single-fiber\ncore, resulting in artifacts throughout the entire\nrange of the Fourier transform image. The magni-\ntude of the different frequencies present varies as\nthe input coupling conditions are adjusted. Figure 11\nshows the effect on the profile with coupling adjusted\nfor (b), (e) minimal and (c), (f) more severe occurrence\nof artifacts. For Configurations 1 and 2, with the re-\nference power at the detector as quoted above, these\neffects correspond to a variance of about 3 \u00d7 10\u221213A2.\nBundle-induced effects therefore limit the actual\nSNR to about 25dB, which is in agreement with ob-\nserved values. Without such effects, the equivalent\nSNR would be closer to 60dB. In the Fizeau con-\nfiguration, all light from the circulator is coupled\ndirectly into the bundle via the scanning mirror;\ntherefore, the reference beam, derived from reflec-\ntion at the coated distal face of the bundle, is now\nweaker relative to the unwanted front-face reflec-\ntion. This increases excess noise, but bundle-induced\neffects are still dominant overall, and are once again\nthe limiting factor in the system. Hence the observed\nSNR is similar in all three configurations.\nAn approximate modal analysis was performed,\nusing the linearly polarized mode approximation,\nto estimate the propagation constants for the two\nlowest-order modes of the bundle cores at the\n1330nm center wavelength. Exact figures for the re-\nfractive index of core and cladding were not known,\nbut the measured output NA, and the fact that most\noptical power appears to be contained within a few\nlow-order modes, are consistent with a V value of\nabout 4. With these assumptions, the group delay\ndifference between the two lowest-order modes\nFig. 11. Profile of detected signal after transmission of laser output through (a) a single-mode fiber, (b) a bundle core, with coupling\nadjusted to minimize artifacts, (c) a bundle core, with coupling adjusted to show more severe occurrence of artifacts. (d)\u2013(f) Corresponding\nOCT signals, calculated from (a)\u2013(c), respectively.\n10 February 2011 \/ Vol. 50, No. 5 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 637\nsuggests a path-length difference of about 8mm for\nthe 1350mm long bundle. This is within the\n10\u201320mm coherence length of the swept source\nand confirms that interference effects between differ-\nent modes are to be expected. Waveguide dispersion\nis relatively insignificant, but it is not possible to cal-\nculate exact oscillation frequencies because material\ndispersion, which is usually much larger than wave-\nguide dispersion in fibers, is not known for the bun-\ndle. As the laser sweeps, the relative phase between\nthe modes changes, causing the output intensity to\noscillate. Oscillation in the 100kHz\u201310MHz range,\ndepending on material dispersion, is predicted with-\nin the laser sweep range for interference between the\ntwo lowest-order modes. However, interference be-\ntween a single pair of modes would be expected to\nproduce only a single artifact at a fixed depth posi-\ntion in the image. In fact, the number of lines present\nimplies that interference is taking place between\nmultiple pairs of modes, or over multiple path-length\ndifferences. A large number of modes present would\nbe necessary to explain the numerous unwanted fre-\nquencies present in the signal, so an additional\nmechanism is implied. Wavelength-dependent cross\ncoupling between the primary fiber core and neigh-\nboring fibers is a possible explanation. There is\nindeed a small but significant degree of coupling be-\ntween the primary core and the six adjacent fiber\ncores. When light was coupled into a single core with-\nin the bundle, a small amount of power was observed\non the NIR CCD camera, emerging from neighboring\ncores. Figure 12(a) is a profile from a camera image,\nshowing the output from the bundle when light is\ncoupled into a single fiber so as to excite primarily\nthe fundamental mode. In this situation, it can be\nseen that a small amount of power emerges from\none or more of the neighboring cores, with a maxi-\nmum of about 1.5% of the total output power appear-\ning in any one of the six nearest neighbors.\nFiber-to-fiber cross coupling would be expected to\nbe greater for higher-order modes, so interference ef-\nfects caused by recoupling to the original fiber core\nshould be reduced by choosing a collection lens NA\nclose to the NA of the fundamental mode. However,\nthere will be remaining wavelength-dependent\nvariations, in both input coupling and cross coupling\nbetween fibers, which will also contribute to the spur-\nious structures seen in images.\nIn practice, the oscillations caused by intermodal\nand cross-coupling effects dominate other noise\nsources in the system and, unfortunately, it is not\npossible to eliminate them other than by altering the\ndesign of the fiber bundle. The rms magnitude of the\nspurious oscillations is roughly equivalent to a sam-\nple reflection of about 0.01%, which is high enough to\nobscure interferometric signals from typical biologi-\ncal tissue samples. However, this does not prevent\nthe technique from being useful in surface-profiling\napplications, or for semitransparent, nonbiological\nsamples.\nIt might appear that an increase in the laser\nsource wavelength (or reduction in core diameter)\nwould improve performance, by eliminating the abil-\nity of the bundle fibers to support higher-order\nmodes. However, the relatively small cladding layer\nbetween the cores causes cross coupling to increase\nas the wavelength approaches the single-mode cut-\noff; at a source wavelength of 1550nm, a much larger\nfraction of light injected into a single-fiber core is\ncross coupled into surrounding fibers, and emerges\nat the distal end of the bundle from the six neighbor-\ning cores, as can be seen in Fig. 12(b). Improvement\nwould, however, be achieved by a design of imaging\nbundle, with both smaller core diameter and a great-\ner cladding thickness separating the cores [41]. Op-\ntical absorbers in the cladding region would reduce\ncross coupling still further. Although the \u201cdead\nspace\u201d in the image would be greater from such a\nbundle, smoothing could be applied to improve image\nappearance [21], and lateral resolution could be ad-\njusted via magnification of the probe optics. If inter-\nmodal effects could be eliminated, and an increase in\nthe transmission of the bundles in the NIR portion of\nthe spectrum achieved, a large performance improve-\nment would result.\nFig. 12.

Conclusions\nThe perceived advantages of eliminating scanning\ncomponents from the endoscope section of an OCT\ninstrument have led to this investigation of systems\nusing imaging fiber bundles. Leached fiber imaging\nbundles have been incorporated into swept-source\nOCT systems, using a variety of optical configura-\ntions, and images have been obtained from test ob-\njects with all three proposed configurations. The\nsystems differ from single-fiber, scanned systems,\nin that images are affected by multimoding, cross\ncoupling, and loss in the bundle cores. Removal of\nDC background, and elimination of unwanted reflec-\ntions, is also more complex in bundle-based systems\nthan in standard single-fiber configurations with\nprobe-tip scanning. The relative merits of three pos-\nsible optical configurations have been compared, and\nsuggestions made for methods to suppress back-\nreflections from the bundle ends, by a combination\nof angle polishing and application of AR coatings.\nCharacteristics of the leached bundles selected for\nthis study have been investigated, and the way in\nwhich each affects image quality has been discussed.\nIt is unlikely that the multimoding problem can be\novercome completely without loss of spatial resolu-\ntion in such systems, but changes in bundle design,\nto reduce losses and multimoding, would improve\nperformance for low-coherence imaging applications.\nThis work has been supported by a grant (EP\/\nF034679\/1) from the UK Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC).\nReferences\n1.
