Introduction \nAn Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), in contrast to a traditional Scanning Electron \nMicroscope which operates under high vacuum, allows a sample to be imaged under a low pressure atmosphere. \nCommon atmospheres used in an ESEM include water vapour, argon or nitrogen [1]. An electron beam ionises \nthe gas to give positive ions and these, in turn, reduce the charge build-up on the material being sampled, which \nwould otherwise charge negatively due to bombardment with electrons. The ionised gas also acts to amplify the \nimage signal when secondary electrons are used to image the surface. The ESEM can be used with a heating \nstage where the sample is placed in a small ceramic crucible located above a heater. Above 600\u02daC, a heat shield, \nwith a small hole to allow imaging, is placed above the ceramic crucible to protect the detector from heating \neffects. The Gaseous Secondary Electron Detector (GSED) is situated directly above the sample, around the \npole piece, and is used to acquire images when the heating stage is in use; other detectors are sensitive to the \nlight emitted by hot samples. The ESEM is, thus, a powerful tool for observing the behaviour of materials at \nhigh temperatures. Heating stages for the ESEM are available commercially but there is no such system that \nwould allow the micromanipulation of materials whilst at these high temperatures. This would be valuable, for \nexample, for obtaining detailed micromechanical information on microstructure evolution during sintering, \nincluding under applied stress [2]. Micromanipulation systems are well established for use under ambient \nconditions. The difficulty at high temperatures is that the piezoelectric transducers, used to generate the precise \nrange of movement, begin to permanently degrade by depolarisation above a certain temperature. The \nmanufacturers of the devices we are using recommend not operating above about 90\u02daC. There is, therefore, an \nengineering design challenge in establishing a system for protecting the piezoelectric crystals from the heat. \nThis challenge is increased by the restrictions introduced by operating within the space inside the ESEM \nchamber, in particular the space between the heating stage, the heat shield and the GSED. The aim here was to \nuse finite element analysis to predict the heat flows for design concepts so as to ensure acceptable conditions for \n 1\nthe piezoelectric device during operation. The predictions were then validated through experiment. The system \nestablished is the first high temperature micromanipulation system in an ESEM. It offers the potential not only \nfor experiments which involve moving particles or material at high temperature, but also for microfabrication at \nhigh temperature in an ESEM. \n2. The Heating Stage and the Design Concept \nThe ESEM used in this work is a Philips XL30 ESEM FEG [3] with a heating stage supplied by FEI [3] (figure \n1). The heating stage heats the alumina crucible (diameter 5 mm) containing the sample to temperatures \nbetween 20 and 1000\u02daC. The heat is generated by a wire coil located beneath the crucible. The heater wire is \nsurrounded with a ceramic adhesive and potted into an alumina holder. The alumina is surrounded by an \ninsulating zirconia based ceramic called Zircar ZYZ-3 [4]. This is separated into two separate sections to allow \nthe alumina holder to be installed and is encased in a water cooled aluminium housing. A stainless steel heat \nshield is located above the crucible and provides thermal protection for the GSED of the ESEM. During \nimaging, the GSED is very close to the heat shield. A small hole in the heat shield allows the centre of the \ncrucible to be viewed. The heating is controlled by a dedicated controller, with an LCD display, which allows \nthe setting of target temperature, temperature ramp and cooling rates. The temperature of the crucible is \nmeasured using a thermocouple located directly beneath the heating coil. There may be some discrepancy \nbetween the displayed temperature values and the actual value because of the separation between the \nthermocouple and the crucible. The manufacturer states that final calibration is performed with the heating stage \ninstalled inside the ESEM and the temperature reading must fall within \u00b120oC of the calibration temperature (at \n760oC) before the stage is accepted to shipment [3]. Calibration is achieved with the use of calibration paints \nwhich visibly change at a specified temperature. The position of the thermocouple is adjusted until the \ncomposition of the paint changes within the required temperature range.   \n \n \n \nFigure 1. ESEM Heating Stage (a) Heating stage installed in the ESEM (b) cross-section through the stage \nshowing component parts (courtesy of FEI). \n \nFor the work reported here, the design concept was initially based on a one-dimensional micromanipulator \navailable from PiezoMotor [5]. This provides movement in one axis in steps of ~ 5 microns. The use of a one-\ndimensional manipulator allowed ideas to be tested with a relatively inexpensive piece of equipment, as \nopposed to using three-dimensional manipulators available on the market. Once 1-D manipulation has been \nproven the principle will be extended to 3-D manipulation. To protect the piezoelectric device from heat a probe \nextension arm made of an insulating material (in this case, a hollow alumina tube) was introduced. The \nmanipulator was mounted to one side of the heating stage within an aluminium frame (figure 2). The 1-D probe \nb.) Section A-A a.)

A copper block (3 in Figure 3) was introduced between the \nalumina arm of the piezoelectric motor and the probe arm to create a thermal break. It also acts as a heat sink \nbut the material was not chosen to optimise this (otherwise a higher emissivity would have been sought). \nMinimising heat transfer from the copper block to the temperature sensitive piezoelectric motor was achieved \nby connecting the square-section piece of alumina on the piezoelectric motor into a drilled cylindrical hole in \nthe copper block such that a friction fit is formed as shown in Figure 2.  \n \nA \n5\n42 1 \n3 \nA Section A-A \n(Not to Scale) \n1 - Piezoelectric Motor  2- Square-Section Alumina Rod 3 - Copper Block \n4 - Alumina Extension Arm 5 - Probe Tip \n \nFigure 2 Manipulator Probe Design (not to scale) \nIn this arrangement conduction of heat to the piezoelectric motor was only possible through the edges of the \nalumina and the smooth, shiny surface of the copper block limits the radiative heat transfer. The probe arm was \nsufficiently small to fit through the narrow gap of approximately 2mm created between the heat shield and the \nstainless steel cover of the heating stage. At the end of the probe, a tungsten tip was attached which juts down \ninto the ceramic crucible and, hence, into the sample to provide manipulation (see figure 3). The axis of \nmovement was parallel with the probe arm. A vertical height adjuster was required to ensure that the \nmanipulator arm was at precisely the right level to fit under the heat shield without lifting it. This was part of \nthe aluminium mounting frame. A temperature sensor was attached to the copper block as a precaution to ensure \nthat the piezoelectric motor was not damaged.  \nFigure 3.

Construction of Finite Element Model  \nA Computed Aided Design (CAD) model of the heating stage was created using dimensions provided by the \nheating stage manufacturers, FEI [3]. The model was appropriately meshed to create the Finite Element (F.E.) \nmodel shown in Figure 4. All modelling was performed using the I-Deas engineering software [6] in \nconjunction with MAYA\u2019s TMG solver [7]. Components of the heating stage were modelled as accurately as \npossible and included modelling of the heater wire coils and cooling fluid.  The high level of detail was \nintroduced as initially it was not clear which features of the heating stage dominated performance. The final \nmodel contained 10281 nodes and 22216 elements. Mesh density was increased in the locality of the heat source \nto improve results. Other components outside the area of prime interest were meshed with the largest possible \nmesh to reduce computation time.  \nStainless Steel \nHeat Shield \n(note that this \nconsists of two \nlayers) \nProbe \nStainless \nSteel \nCover \nHeating Stage \nAluminium \nHousing \n \nFigure 4. F.E. Model of Heating Stage and Manipulator Probe \nThe ESEM operates at a pressure of 2 torr or lower. Taking into account the pumping speed and ESEM \nchamber size the flow conditions are considered to be transitional and molecule mean free path is close to the \nchamber diameter [8]. In these conditions the primary modes of heat transfer for the heating stage are by \nconduction and radiation. Therefore convection is considered negligible and not included in the analysis. \nConductance modelling was performed using the Finite Element Centre of Gravity (CG) method. This method \nestablishes a calculation point in the element\u2019s centre of gravity as well as at each boundary [9]. Conductance is \nestablished between the boundary points using an algorithm which constrains linear element temperature \nfunctions to satisfy the governing partial differentiation equation. The calculation point at the centre of gravity \nis used to distribute heat transfer to the boundary nodes in the element. The element temperature is computed \nassuming a piecewise linear temperature distribution in the element. The solver evaluates temperature at each \ncalculation point and once the matrix is solved, temperatures are interpolated to the mesh nodes. The CG \nmethod is chosen in preference to the Element Centre method as it generates high accuracy results, facilitates \nmodelling of temperature dependant properties and has little sensitivity to element distortion. However, this led \nto longer solve times.  \nEach component of the heating stage is filled with linear tetrahedron solid elements and covered in a shell of \nnull thickness. The conductance is achieved by defining thermal coupling between null shell layers. This \nmethod enables heat transfer to occur between bodies without the need for a physical coupling. For analysis, \nconductance paths between materials in close proximity are assumed perfect. This is due to the difficulty in \ndetermining the degree of contact between parts. This assumption may be the cause of errors as without contact \nonly radiative heat transfer occurs. However, it is extremely difficult to determine an appropriate conductance \nvalue as many variables are involved. The heating stage was disassembled and it was found there was near- \nfriction fit between parts and this gave confidence that a perfect contact assumption could be applied. Perfect \ncontact is simulated in the model by specifying very high conductance values in the thermal coupling between \nparts. \nLinking different parts by thermal couplings must be performed carefully to avoid production of thermal \u201cshort-\ncircuits\u201d. If thermal couplings are applied incorrectly the model can produce unnatural conductance paths which \n 4\n 5\nproduce unrealistic results. Validation of the model was achieved by applying thermal boundaries around \ngroups of parts with thermal couplings and comparing the results to hand calculations using Fourier\u2019s \nconductance law. This method of validation allows gross errors in the model to be identified without the need to \ngenerate complex validation calculations. However, this method does not allow small errors to be identified as \nagreement between hand calculations and the analytical model is often not close. In most cases, the user had to \ndetermine whether the results were sufficiently close for acceptability, based on the area of the model being \nconsidered. For example, the walls of the alumina holder (labelled as 4 in Figure 1 section b) surrounding were \nchecked by applying a 1000W heat load on the inside surface while the external surface is held at 250\u02daC. \nFouriers law determines that the interior wall temperature should be 1067\u02daC and the model predicts 932\u02daC, \nthereby giving a 12.7% error. This is sufficiently close given that the calculation does not account for the \nthicker bottom section of the alumina holder. The thicker bottom section will cause the calculated result to be \nhigher than the F.E. model.  This gives further confidence that this region of the model operates correctly. \nDistorted elements can result in the generation of negative conductances within elements. The mesh was \nchecked for angles larger than 135o as these can cause potential conductance problems [10]. Where these \nelements existed, the mesh density was redefined until as many large angle elements as possible were removed \nfrom the analysis. Removal of all large angles was not possible and the solver was required to perform some \nmodifications to conductances within elements. Steps were taken to ensure that conduction modification was \nminimised and ultimately only 0.44 % of the elements were affected. The modified elements were not \nconstrained to a single part and were distributed throughout the model. Therefore the conduction modification \nwas considered sufficiently small to be ignored and results would be dominated by the correctly operating \nelements. \nI-Deas TMG Thermal Analysis (TMG) allows the thermal couplings between elements to occur either between \nelements that overlap across the thermal coupling or between all elements. In all cases, it was appropriate for \nheat transfer to occur between overlapping elements. Generally it was discovered that connecting thermal \ncouplings using all available elements resulted in an unnatural dispersion of heat through the system as \nunrealistic thermal paths were generated.  \nRadiation is modelled using the standard radiation solver within the TMG package. Heat transfer between \ninternal components of the heating stage is dominated by conduction as contact is assumed perfect. Therefore, \nradiation modelling was only applied to surfaces exposed to ambient conditions and was only performed \nbetween the thin shells surrounding solid parts and beam elements. Solid elements are ignored and reliance is \nplaced on the null shells surrounding the parts to generate radiative heat transfer. To absorb energy from the \nsystem a \u201cspace enclosure\u201d is created around the stage. The space enclosure creates one large cube made of six \nor more elements that enclose the model and local space around it [10]. The calculation of radiative heat \ntransfer is based on view factors between pairs of elements. Objects with direct line of sight have their view \nfactors calculated first. The remaining elements have shadowing checks performed to determine the proportion \nof radiative heat transfer available based on unobstructed area [10].  \n \n4. Material Properties \nThe thermal properties of materials were carefully chosen and defined to vary with temperature to produce \nrealistic results. Most properties were extracted from standard text books and from manufacturer data sheets. \nHowever, emissivity and absorptivity are dependant upon surface finish and environmental conditions and these \nproperties were varied to see what effect the changes had on the overall results and used as a means of fine \ntuning the model. The final material properties used in the model are given in table 1. The sensitivity of the F.E. \nmodel to the values is evaluated by changing, in turn, all thermal conductivity values by 50% from the optimal \nvalue and determining the percentage change of temperature at the centre of the crucible. The dominance of the \nthermal conductance of the Zircar is clear as the sensitivity to its thermal conductivity is approximately 22 times \ngreater than that of the next most influential material alumina.

Results from the F. E. Model for the Heating Stage \nHeat is generated in the model by applying a transient heat load to the wire coils of the heater. The \nheat load is derived from experiments in which voltage and current measurements were taken \nduring the heating cycles as shown in Figure 5.  \n \nFigure 5.

The Zircar block surrounds the heater and its very low thermal conductivity \nenables heat to be stored within the crucible. The main thermal path for heat to leave the stage is \nby radiation through the crucible surface. As the emissivity of alumina is hard to determine, the \nproperty was used as a means of providing fine tuning in order for results to correlate with \nexperimental data.  \nIn the heating stage, the temperature of the crucible is measured remotely through a thermocouple \nmounted underneath the heater. In the finite element model, a node was located at the same \nposition as the thermocouple to create a measurement location to predict thermocouple \ntemperatures. A comparison between the temperatures at the crucible surface to the thermocouple \nduring transient analysis is shown in Figure 6. The result shows that, in at least analytical terms, \nthe thermocouple output and the temperature of the crucible should be very similar across the \noperating temperature range.  \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (o\nC\n) \n0\nTime (minutes)\n \nFigure 6.

F.E. Modelling of the Micromanipulator \nThe 1-D manipulator actuates a probe which has a tungsten needle tip to provide manipulation of \nthe sample. The maximum operating temperature of the manipulator is about 90\u02daC and to provide \nthermal protection the probe is required to limit heat transfer to the piezoelectric motors.  The F.E. \nmodel was used to design the probe and prove its feasibility before implementation in the heating \nstage. The probe is modelled using beam elements of appropriate section sizes. In addition, an \naluminium alloy disc was modelled inside the crucible to represent the sample. The probe is \nmodelled assuming a worst-case scenario, whereby the probe tip is submerged into the sample and \nis in perfect contact with the crucible. This generates the maximum possible heat transfer into the \nprobe. The main section of the probe was constructed using alumina ceramic thin-walled tube due \nto its structural stability over a large temperature range, low thermal conductivity and high melting \npoint. In reality, zirconia would be a better material choice but it was not possible to procure an \nappropriate section size. The F.E. model was used to simulate a single length of alumina acting as \nthe extension arm. As with the modelling of the heating stage, perfect conduction is assumed \nbetween the elements. This is achieved by sharing nodes between beam elements and does not \nrequire the specification of thermal couplings. The results for a 650\u02daC set-point temperature \nshowed that the temperature of the piezoelectric was 121\u02daC and would be damaged. To improve \nthe thermal protection, a cylindrical copper block and larger square section of alumina was \nincorporated as indicated in figure 2.  \nThe cylindrical copper block has holes drilled into either end to accommodate both sections of \nalumina and coupling is assumed perfect. However, the square section alumina is attached using a \nfriction fit connection at each corner. This minimises conduction and heat transfer is dominated by \nradiation. The connection is modelled by creating a small gap of 0.1mm between the copper block \nand the alumina through which a near-zero conductance is specified. The parts are sufficiently \nclose that radiative heat transfer is representative. The F.E. model analysis showed that with this \narrangement the piezoelectric would remain within safe operating temperatures across the \noperating range of the heating stage. A comparison between the F.E model predicted temperatures \n 9\nand temperatures measured during experiment (for 650\u02daC set-point) is shown in Figure 8. The \nresults show reasonable agreement and validate the analytical approach. The figure also shows the \ntemperature distribution across the probe with a single length of alumina.  \n \nProbe With Copper Block \nArrangement \nProbe without Copper Block Location \nExperiment Temp \n(\u02daC) \nF.E.

Comparison of F.E. and Experimental Results for Manipulator Probe Design for a 650\u02daC Set-Point \nTemperature after 1 hour of heating  \nDiscrepancies between the experimental values and the F.E. model are expected due to limitations \nin both methods. The F.E. model assumes perfect conditions which are not always represented in \nthe heating stage experiments. Even when using the calibrated model continual changes in the \nenvironment and heating stage performance are not accounted for and can result in errors when \nusing the model to predict temperatures for different heat loads. In addition during experiments up \nto 6 measurements were taken by hand using various digital meters at a single interval. These \nmeasurements took up to 20 seconds to record and introduced errors as values are continuously \nchanging. The introduction of measuring equipment (e.g. thermocouples) adds additional sources \nof heat loss which result in the stage behaving differently to when a sample is being heated. The \nextents of these errors are difficult to quantify due to their variability. It is reasonable to assume \nthat the differences in experimental temperatures and F.E. model temperatures can be largely \naccounted for by these errors. However, as a safety precaution to any unexpected changes in \nperformance which could result in the damage of the piezoelectric motor a temperature sensor was \nadded onto the copper block connected to the 1-D manipulator probe. \nIn addition to protecting the piezoelectric transducers, the probe must not act as a heat sink and \nremove significant quantities of heat from the crucible. This could lead to localised cold regions \nbeing created in the sample. The F.E. model was used to check this and figure 9 shows the \ntemperature distribution across the sample when the probe is attached. The result shows that no \nlocalised cold regions are formed in the sample.  \n \n1 \n2 \n \n1 \n2\n \n3   \n 10\n \n \nFigure 9. Temperature distribution across the sample in the crucible for a 650\u02daC Set-Point \nTemperature \n \nThe temperature distribution is shown extremely clearly across the crucible surface. The coils of \nthe heating wires are closest at the centre and therefore peak temperatures in the crucible are \ndeveloped in this region. However, the cooling water runs along one side of the heating stage and \nthis creates a cooler region along one side. The effect on the sample is shifting of the hot region \nslightly away from the centre and towards the hotter side of the heating stage. It is important to \nnote that the maximum temperature variation across the crucible is only 3\u02daC indicating that most \nexperiments can be conducted in any region of the crucible. \n \n7. Experimental Validation  \nExperiments were conducted whereby thermocouples were bonded to key points of the heating \nstage. These bonding locations included the crucible surface and along the 1-D probe. In these \nexperiments the 1-D manipulator probe tungsten tip was used to pin the thermocouple to the \ncrucible surface, which was filled with AREMCO 569 alumina based ceramic adhesive [12] to \nensure good thermal conduction. It was found that without bonding the thermocouple and the \nprobe tip to the crucible surface incorrect temperatures were measured as the thermocouple tended \nto lift from the crucible surface. In this case, the thermocouple would only measure radiative heat \nwhich is significantly lower than the actual surface temperature.  A comparison of F.E. and \ntemperatures recorded during experiments is shown in Figures 10. Each set of result uses different \nramp inputs and peak temperatures. The results show reasonable correlation between the F.E and \nexperimental data. \n \n 11\nFor the 650oC set-point experiment there is approximately 45oC between the experimental result \nand the prediction at the end of the run. This maybe associated with the errors for thermocouple \nmeasurement discussed in Section 6.  \n0\n100\n200\n300\nFigure 10. Comparison between Experiment and F.E. Model Results for Different Operating \nConditions. \n \nAt 950oC, the discrepancy in Figure 10 between the 900\u02daC set point temperature and the \ntemperatures measured during experiment is larger. This has not been resolved and is under \ninvestigation. The 900\u02daC set point temperature experiment was performed after the heating stage \nhad been used for over its normal lifespan. The extra use may have caused the Zircar and adhesive \ncement around the heating coil to break down resulting in heat leakage and potentially causing the \nstage\u2019s thermocouple to measure temperatures, which are not representative of the crucible (i.e. the \noriginal calibration is not valid). In addition the addition of thermocouples wires and ceramic \nadhesive to the crucible may cause a large temperature gradient across the heating coil. This is due \nto heat loss through the thermocouple wires and the additional thermal mass of the ceramic \nadhesive. However, there is evidence that the stage power circuit compensates for this.  \n \n8. Demonstration of Manipulation \nThe principle of manipulating a sample in the heating stage was proved using a small sample of \naluminium alloy and the 1-D manipulator. Before the experiment, the 1-D manipulator probe tip \nwas positioned on top of the sample. The probe tip applied a force on the surface such that it \nwould indent the surface when the sample became semi-solid. The sample was heated using a \nheating load input used in F.E. model calibration. This heat load was demonstrated in experiment \nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u02da\nC\n) \n40\n50\n60\n0\n0\n0\n700\n800\n900\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150\nTime (minutes)\n650\u02daC Set Point F.E.

At a heater controller display temperature of 650\u02daC, the 1-D Manipulator was \nactivated and the probe tip moved across the sample, creating a hole in the surface. The results of \nthe deformation are shown in Figure 11. The results clearly show the hole made by the probe tip in \nthe sample and the deformed grains around the hole surface. The quality of the images obtained \ndemonstrates that the presence of the probe does not degrade image quality.

Concluding remarks \nThe aim here was to test the design of a system for high temperature micromanipulation in an \nEnvironmental Scanning Electron Microscope with finite element modelling and experimental \nvalidation. A one-dimensional probe was used as a simple, inexpensive model of a three-\ndimensional micromanipulation system. The predictions from finite element modelling give \nreasonable agreement with experimental results from thermocouples although there are \ndiscrepancies the highest temperatures. These may be associated with the degradation of the \ninsulation in the heating stage with prolonged use. The use of the one-dimensional manipulator at \nhigh temperature in the ESEM has been successfully demonstrated by making a crater in the \nsurface of an aluminium sample and by pushing copper power particles across the base of the \ncrucible.  \n \n10.
