A potential conflict, therefore, exists as nursing homes are\nboth a place where life is lived and where death is regularly encountered. It\nhas been proposed that within residential care homes for older people, dying\nindividuals are separated from living people. Drawing on fieldwork\nundertaken in four English nursing homes the management of the dying\nprocess and the relationship between life and death is explored. There is much\nuncertainty inherent in the boundary between life and death for many\nresidents in nursing homes. The relationship between life and death for these\nresidents is less about the sequestration of dying people from living people, but\nrather the creation of transitional states between these two polarities.\nKEY WORDS \u2013 Nursing homes, sequestration, death and dying, social\ndeath.\nIntroduction\nIt has been proposed that within Western society dying and ageing\npeople are separated, geographically and socially, from younger\n\u2018 living\u2019 people (Mulkay and Ernst 1991). This setting apart of dying\npeople has also been observed within institutions that care for older\npeople (Hockey 1990 : 98\u2013101 ; Mulkay and Ernst 1991 : 183). The\nnature of the relationship between living and dying residents in nursing\nhomes and the management of this transition is explored within this\npaper drawing upon fieldwork undertaken in four English nursing\nhomes.\nSequestration and society\nGiddens\u2019 work concerning the nature of modern society and the\nindividual proposes that we currently live in a time of great change and\n* Macmillan Practice Development Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London.\n320 Katherine Froggatt\nmovement at global and individual levels (Giddens 1991). As a\nconsequence, the reflexive reordering of biographical narratives shapes\nself-identity, and there is an increasing identification of the self with the\nbody (Mellor and Shilling 1993). Events that may interfere with the\nregularity of daily life are controlled, primarily through the setting\napart of these experiences so they do not impinge upon the rest of\nsociety. Sickness and death, madness and criminality are all experiences\nthat are concealed and set apart from the routines of ordinary life\n(Giddens 1991 : 156).\nThe process of individualisation that characterises modernity, and\nthe lack of the religious structures and practices which formerly shaped\nsociety, means that people cannot easily incorporate the inevitability of\ndeath. As a consequence it has become a relatively hidden experience\n(Mellor and Shilling 1993) and the boundaries surrounding living and\ndying people strengthened. This is manifested particularly in the\ncreation of spaces where the bodily evidence of sickness and death are\nset apart, that is, in hospitals (Giddens 1991 ; Mellor and Shilling\n1993), hospices (Mellor 1993 ; Mellor and Shilling 1993), nursing\nhomes and residential care homes (Hockey 1990 ; Mulkay and Ernst\n1991).\nSequestration is the term given to this process of setting apart or\nseparating out. With respect to death and dying the term has been used\nin two ways. First, at a societal level, sequestration has been used as a\nconcept to describe the way in which contemporary \u2018modern\u2019 society\nhas set death apart from the ordinary lives of individual people. This\nmay be facilitated through the use of organisations (Giddens 1991 ;\nMellor 1993 ; Mellor and Shilling 1993) or through the more general\ncharacteristics of the systems of modernity (Giddens 1991). Secondly,\nthe model of sequestration has been used to explain the separation of\ndefined groups of people within an institution. Dying older people in\nresidential care homes are kept apart from those residents who are\nperceived to be living (Hockey 1990) and in hospices patients with\n\u2018unbounded\u2019 bodies are separated from other patients whose bodies\nremain \u2018bounded\u2019 (Lawton 1998).\nAnother manifestation of the sequestration of death and dying within\nsociety can be seen in the presence of social death, which represents the\nsetting apart of people from a social perspective. Social death has been\ndefined as the cessation of the individual as an active agent in other\npeople\u2019s lives (Glaser and Strauss 1965 ; Sudnow 1967 ; Glaser and\nStrauss 1968 ; Mulkay and Ernst 1991 ; Hertz 1960). Social death is\nlinked to, but not predicated upon, bodily death, and social death\nincreasingly occurs in Western society before the biological death\nevent.\nLife and death in English nursing homes 321\nSocial death is particularly pertinent when considering the move\nfrom life to death amongst older people. The emphasis on the future,\npresent within high modernity, is incorporated by younger people, not\nolder people whose future is more obviously limited (Mellor and\nShilling 1993). As a consequence, the subject of ageing is avoided, and\nolder people are socially marginalised (Hockey and James 1993). There\nare several ways in which this marginalisation is manifested. These\ninclude the act of retirement which signifies a leaving of social roles\noccupied in society, the physical separation or institutionalisation of\nolder people which leads to a distancing from social networks, and the\npresence of anticipatory grief in relatives (Mulkay and Ernst 1991).\nSweeting and Gilhooly go so far as to propose that three groups of\npeople have been identified as being socially dead within society\n(Sweeting and Gilhooly 1991\u20131992 ; Sweeting and Gilhooly 1997).\nThey define these groups as very old people, those individuals at the\nend stage of a long term chronic illness, and people who are perceived\nto have lost their personhood, akin to Goffman\u2019s notion of the \u2018non-\nperson\u2019 (Goffman 1959).\nSociety, therefore, copes with the reality of death, and ageing as a\nprecursor to death, by setting apart the people who bear visible\nevidence of the processes of dying. A variety of institutions provide\nspace for this sequestration, for example hospitals and hospices, and\nthis paper focuses on the nature of this separation within one type of\ncare institution for older people \u2013 nursing homes.\nMethods\nThe data considered in this paper are drawn from an evaluation of the\n\u2018Palliative Care Education Pilot Project in Nursing Homes\u2019 (Froggatt\n2000a, 2000b), funded by Macmillan Cancer Relief and The Wolfson\nFoundation in partnership with the Registered Nursing Home\nAssociation. In this evaluation, four case study nursing homes were\npurposively sampled from the 54 nursing homes that had participated\nin the educational project. Only the 38 nursing homes where both\nregistered nurses and health care assistants had undertaken the\neducational courses were included (the remaining 16 nursing homes\nhad only sent registered nurses to the educational courses). In order to\nensure the representativeness of these sites, the four case study nursing\nhomes were selected to represent the following range of factors :\nE nursing homes from four different health authorities ;\nE nursing homes that were independently owned by an individual,\nand nursing homes that were owned by a commercial group;\n322 Katherine Froggatt\nTable 1. Case study nursing homes\nNursing home\" Daisey Lodge Parkleigh Braelands Fairgreen\nAverage number of beds 35 30 65 30\nAncillary staff on the\neducational course\nYes Yes No No\nRegistered nurses doing\nassignment\nYes Yes No No\nHealth care assistants doing\nassignment\nYes Yes No No\nOwnership Single home\nowner\nSingle home\nowner\nGroup home Single home\nowner\nPalliative care beds 4 None None None\n\" The names of the case study nursing homes have been changed to preserve their anonymity.\nE nursing homes with and without allocated palliative care beds ;\nE nursing homes where course members undertook assignments, and\nnursing homes where staff chose not to undertake assignments.\nDetails of the four nursing homes identified are presented in Table 1.\nUpon being approached, all agreed to participate in the study. Within\neach of the four nursing homes the researcher, who worked as a care\nassistant, carried out a three-week period of participant observation.\nAlthough focusing primarily upon the impact of an educational\nprogramme upon the practice of nursing and care staff, the approaches\nto care and the nature of death and dying within the nursing home\ncontext were also observed. A total of 411 hours of observational\nfieldwork was undertaken during these four visits. A variety of shifts\nwere worked including one weekend and one night in each nursing\nhome to give a broad overview of nursing home work.\nDuring this time, 43 interviews were carried out with staff at all\nlevels, including home owners, registered nurses, health care assistants\nand ancillary workers. The interviews focused on the impact of the\neducational courses undertaken, the nature of the care work and the\nplace of death and dying within the nursing home. All interviews were\ntranscribed and, along with the observational fieldnotes, were ana-\nlysed using a computer-based qualitative data analysis package\n(NUD*IST), which facilitated the coding of the data for recurrent\nthemes and issues.\nSequestration or transition?\nIt has been proposed that, within some institutions caring for older\npeople such as residential care homes, sequestration exists to separate\nLife and death in English nursing homes 323\nthose close to death from those whose death is less imminent (Hockey\n1990). Hockey identified that the residents in the residential home she\nstudied were classified as either \u2018fit \u2019 or \u2018 frail \u2019 and that this had\nimplications for the spatial locations, social roles occupied and care\nreceived by these residents (Hockey 1990). This division between the\n\u2018fit \u2019 and the \u2018 frail \u2019 represented a separation between the living and\nthe dying within residential homes. Within nursing homes, however, the\nboundary between life and death is not so clearly defined, reflecting the\nfunctions that nursing homes as institutions fulfil and the dying\ntrajectories experienced by many residents in this setting.\nAt a societal level, nursing homes are imputed with the task of\ncontaining the visible manifestations of ageing by society (Hockey\n1990) and offer a form of social control over people who are no longer\nindependent (Peace et al. 1997). More pragmatically, a tension was\ncreated for the case study nursing homes in that they cared for living\nand dying residents whilst being organisationally positioned in the\nprivate sector of English healthcare.\nThe four case study nursing homes were businesses, situated outside\nthe publicly-financed National Health Service. They were owned\nvariously by an individual, a group of individuals, and as part of a large\ncommercial company. Through the provision of care for older people,\nthe businesses aimed to make a profit for shareholders or owners. These\nnursing homes, in order to be successful, had to retain a high level of\nbed occupancy and offered both a home for older people as they lived\nthere, and a place where nursing care could be provided when needed,\nor until the death of a resident.\nBeing a home was an important part of the ideology of the case study\nnursing homes. An emphasis on life and living permeated the culture\nof these four nursing homes. This manifested itself in a variety of ways,\nincluding their promotional literature; for example: \u2018We\u2019re opening\nup new lives for the elderly \u2026 our residents too can look forward to a\nnew lease of life \u2019 (Braelands Nursing Home promotional literature).\nThe reality of this new future was a life that was centred on the\npresent, drawing on the strands of the past. This emphasis did not\nopenly acknowledge the limited duration of the future and the\ninevitability that the majority of residents would die in the care of the\nnursing home. Interestingly, unlike the residential care home studied\nby Hockey (1990), these nursing homes also had an explicit com-\nmitment to nursing care, as described by this registered nurse :\nThe aim of the home is summed up in our mission statement, that we try to\noffer \u2026 high quality nursing care in a homely type of atmosphere. Trying to\n324 Katherine Froggatt\ntreat people as if they are in their own homes, and try and remember that. But\nbalancing it with the hospital-type nursing care environment. And that\u2019s often\nhard to do. (Parkleigh Nursing Home, registered nurse 2, course member)\nThe nursing homes held in balance being both a home and a place of\nnursing care. This can be seen in the terms used to describe the people\nwho lived in the nursing homes. In three of them, they were called\nresidents, whereas staff in the fourth called them patients. One of the\nnursing homes that used the term residents, however, produced\nliterature for the care assistants that described the residents as patients,\nso capturing the ambiguity in the choice of language. In offering\nnursing care, nursing homes were following a health care model,\nwhereby people were patients. Given the constraints on funding within\nthe United Kingdom at the time of the study, nursing homes were\nseeking to identify their expertise as distinct from residential care\nhomes. Making explicit the place of the health care model within their\nculture by, for example, calling the people who lived in the nursing\nhome patients, was one way of achieving this.\nThe nature of the dying experienced by residents in nursing homes\nalso shaped the life-death boundary. The way people died varied\ngreatly, reflecting a range of ages and physical and mental conditions\nthat residents lived with. In the four nursing homes visited, the ages of\nresidents varied from 57 years to 101 years. Unlike people with cancer\nwhere, until recently, the majority of people have experienced a\nrelatively predictable dying trajectory, the dying processes of nursing\nhome residents were generally longer-term and less certain.\nIn order to set dying people apart from living people, knowledge is\nrequired that allows an individual to be defined as dying. What has\nemerged from work that considers death amongst older people, is that\nthe \u2018when\u2019 of death is much less clear than amongst younger people\n(Blackburn 1989 ; Seale 1989 ; Seale 1991). It has been recognised that\nsituations of ageing and dying where the \u2018when\u2019 of death is unknown\nor unpredictable, are likely to be problematic for the dying individuals\nand those people caring for them (Field 1998). For elderly or confused\npeople, or individuals living with a chronic disease, there exists\nuncertainty about a prognosis, and the absence of a diagnosis that\ndefines them as being terminal. As McCue (1995) notes, a proportion\nof very elderly people die from \u2018natural \u2019 causes that cannot be\nattributed to a specific disease or condition, so creating situations where\na prognosis is lacking. These people may therefore be denied access to\nthe dying role, as defined by Glaser and Strauss (1965, 1968), be it a\nmodern dying role (Field 1996, 1998) or a \u2018heroic \u2019 death (Seale 1995).\nDeath amongst older people has been considered from both a\nLife and death in English nursing homes 325\nsymptom management perspective (Wilson et al. 1987 ; Mogielnicki et\nal. 1990), as well as from that of its physical, psychological, social and\ntemporal dimensions (Blackburn 1989 ; Seale 1991 ; Severs and Wilkins\n1991). Sidell et al. (1997) retrospectively classified residential and\nnursing home resident deaths in four ways: sudden death, death\nfollowing a terminal illness, death following an acute episode, and\ndeath as a process of general deterioration. The type of death which is\nleast well understood, but which is significant in nursing homes, is the\nprocess of general deterioration. Although defined as a dying process in\nits own right, this may also be the stage that precedes an acute episode\nor sudden death. The process of general deterioration is a long-term\none occurring over months and years.\nIt was described by staff in the nursing homes in a variety of ways.\nResidents were \u2018going downhill \u2019, people \u2018 lingered\u2019 or were described\nas \u2018 fading\u2019 or \u2018 failing\u2019. The following example, from one of the homes,\nillustrates this slow process of deterioration.\nMr Black, a 91-year-old gentleman, had been resident in Fairgreen\nNursing Home for two-and-a-half years before his death. He had\nsuffered a stroke before being admitted to the nursing home, and was\nalso confused at times. As a consequence, he wandered around the\nnursing home from his room on the basement floor up to the ground\nfloor lounge. The care staff described Mr Black as having \u2018rapidly gone\ndown fast \u2019 over a period of three months. Having initially lost his voice,\nhe then began to have difficulty in swallowing and eating and was\nlosing weight. Mr Black\u2019s condition changed both physically and\nbehaviourally, as noted by the staff I interviewed:\nHe just started going down. He was, always under your feet wandering up and\ndown stairs and then, he was just always behind you and then all of a sudden\nhe\u2019s just started going down. Nothing specific, just looking haggard, old. His\ncolour, very, very breathless and then more fidgety than normal and then,\nfrom that, not even coming upstairs which isn\u2019t him. (Fairgreen Nursing\nHome, registered nurse 4)\nThe process of general deterioration described above was marked by\nchanges in the resident\u2019s physical, mental or social health and\nsubsequent dependency. The slow physical deterioration that repre-\nsented the ageing and dying of many residents was not dramatic, but\ncontained an element of uncertainty regarding their final resolution\nthrough death.\nStaff in these nursing homes could not always predict when a\nresident would die as residents moved between the different life-death\ntrajectories. There were instances where residents \u2018bounced back\u2019 from\n326 Katherine Froggatt\nstates of near death, as well as situations where they appeared to linger\non before they finally died (Froggatt 2000b). An example of the\n\u2018bouncing back\u2019 phenomenon was Mrs Jones, a 72-year-old lady, who\nhad been resident in Braelands Nursing Home for over three years. She\nhad a chronic lung problem and arthritis, and since being admitted\nhad suffered a minor stroke. Widowed with children, she had a male\nfriend who visited her daily and often took her out for the day. One\nmorning when I went in to work I heard that Mrs Jones was poorly,\nshe had been ill overnight. She had been diagnosed as having had\nanother stroke, the duty doctor having been called in to see her at 3 am\nthat morning. Mrs Jones\u2019 male friend and son had been called in and\nwere sitting with her during the night.\nDuring that day, the door of her room was kept open and her friend\nand son could be seen sitting around the bed. As I left the nursing home\nthat day, there was a sense of waiting for this death, particularly on the\nupstairs floor where her room was located. The next morning as I\nentered the dining room to collect breakfast for a resident, I was\nsurprised to see Mrs Jones being pushed into the dining room in a\nwheelchair by her son. Again at lunchtime, things seemed to be back\nto normal, Mrs Jones occupied her usual place in the dining room, with\nher friend sitting next to her. The talk in the staff room that morning\nreminded everyone that this was not the first time Mrs Jones had done\nthis. About nine months earlier she had become very ill, and had even\nhad the Last Rites, before she had made an equally quick recovery.\nThis was an example of a resident who, seemingly stable, suddenly\nhad an acute event, a stroke, which meant she was expected to die. The\ndynamics changed in readiness for a death. The wait began with family\nand friends present, and regular nursing care provided and overseen by\nthe qualified nurse. However, within 24 hours Mrs Jones was\nreintegrated back into the life of the nursing home.\nIt was in this climate of uncertainty and, often prolonged,\ndeterioration that many nursing home residents died. The care staff\nwho worked in such institutions, both qualified nurses and health care\nassistants, had to make sense of this dying, whilst also caring for\nresidents who were comparatively well and living their lives within\ntheir \u2018home\u2019. For people whose condition deteriorated over many\nmonths and years, this lack of knowledge about when their death\nwould occur meant that a clear distinction between when someone was\nliving or dying was not possible. In such instances the transitional state\n(the living-dying interval) between life and death was as important as\nthe absolute life and death categories themselves (Pattison 1977 ; Engle\n1998).\nLife and death in English nursing homes 327\n\u2018Being poorly \u2019\nAn important category that was used by staff to manage the uncertainty\nwas a transitional state called \u2018being poorly \u2019. This was a definitional\ncategory that allowed staff to set apart residents who were ill, and also\na category that conveyed meaning within the nursing home regarding\nthe changes in a resident\u2019s condition (Hockey 1990 ; Miskella and Avis\n1998 ; Froggatt 1999). The term was used by staff, particularly during\nthe handover of information from one shift to the next or when talking\nwith relatives about a person\u2019s condition. Talking about a resident as\n\u2018poorly \u2019 sent signals to other members of staff and relatives that the\ncondition had changed and that the person might die, whilst also\nacknowledging that this was not always the case.\n\u2018Being poorly \u2019 was a term that I heard being used by staff, residents\nand relatives to describe particular individuals. The primary attribute\nof being poorly was that the person, so defined, was perceived by others\nto be on a downward decline with respect to their state of health. The\ncauses of being poorly were attributed either to an acute event, for\nexample, staff talked about residents with a bowel obstruction or\nfollowing a stroke as being poorly although, as in Mrs Jones\u2019 case, this\nstate was not necessarily permanent. Sometimes there was no specific\nreason why someone was defined as being poorly and this state was\nattributed to a gradual, general decline, the slow process of\ndeterioration described earlier.\nThe increased dependency of the resident whilst in this state would\nmean that the care staff would assume responsibility for more of the\nphysical care of the residents which these individuals would formerly\nhave undertaken for themselves. As a consequence, the individual\nconcerned occupied a different space from other residents. He or she\nwas more likely to be in their bedroom, and less involved in the\nactivities that occurred in the public spaces. The following quote from\na health care assistant in one of the case study nursing homes describes\nthe separation of one such resident into his bedroom:\nI think he\u2019s gone down a hell of a lot, an awful lot. \u2026 Well say three weeks ago\nhe was moving around in his wheelchair and eating and drinking on his own\nand he\u2019s gone to, in bed, not moving, and not eating and drinking. In the\nspace of three weeks at the very most. (Braelands Nursing Home, health care\nassistant 2)\nWithin this transitional state, separation occurred which varied from\nday to day, even within a day, reflecting both the individual resident\u2019s\ncondition and choices, and the different perceptions held by staff of the,\n328 Katherine Froggatt\nprimarily physical, state of residents. The occupation of different spaces\nand social roles whilst categorised as \u2018being poorly \u2019 indicated that there\nwere some sequestration practices present within these institutions that\nmirrored the sequestration of death and ageing within wider society.\nSequestration practices in nursing homes\nStaff set apart not only residents who were perceived to be poorly, as\nalready described, but also residents who were perceived to have\nexperienced a loss of personhood, or demonstrated signs of unbounded\nbodies. A loss of personhood was identified earlier as one of the causes\nof social death in contemporary society (Sweeting and Gilhooly\n1991\u20131992). An individual resident could experience a loss of\npersonhood either when their ability to communicate was impaired or\nwhen they possessed an unbounded body. Where an individual was\nunable to communicate rationally and clearly to staff, then decisions\nwould be made on their behalf. This could occur where the person was\nconfused, or because of a physical condition which limited their ability\nto communicate clearly such as a stroke.\nConsequently, the residents who were able to communicate clearly\nwere more able to make choices about their occupation of physical\nspace in the nursing home, and the social roles they occupied. Those\nresidents who, for whatever reason, were unable to communicate were\nnot able to exert this choice. During the fieldwork, for example, I\nobserved in all four nursing homes that, when residents were moved in\nreadiness for mealtimes or prepared for bed, it was often those residents\nwho were confused who would be moved or helped first. As one health\ncare assistant commented about choosing particular residents to get\nready for bed at 5 pm, \u2018 they are confused and know no better \u2019.\nThe individual with an unbounded body could also be perceived by\nothers, or even by themselves, as no longer fully human. Lawton (1998,\n2000) has suggested that, within contemporary hospices, it is people\nwith cancer who were dying with unbounded bodies (fistulae, fungating\ntumours, lymphoedema) who were sequestered away from mainstream\nsociety and within the hospice. People who have such unbounded\nbodies experience a loss of self, and therefore encounter a social death\nbefore their bodily demise. For older people the deterioration of their\nbody, physically and mentally, was also a significant reason for\nseparation into institutional care.\nLife and death in English nursing homes 329\nIt is recognised that the nature of the unbounded body in the case\nstudy nursing homes was not as extreme as in Lawton\u2019s examples\n(Lawton 1998). Incontinence was probably the most obvious way in\nwhich older people\u2019s bodies were unbounded. Attaining continence is\nseen as a developmental milestone amongst children, a sign of\nincreasing maturity, whereas incontinence in older people is understood\nto be a marker of deterioration (Mitteness and Barker 1995). Other\nways in which older people\u2019s bodies were increasingly unbounded were\npressure sores, unhealed wounds, chest infections and the subsequent\nexpectoration of infected sputum.\nIn general, people with unbounded bodies would only be set apart\nfrom other residents when the evidence of unboundedness could not be\nignored. Where possible, boundaries would be created to contain the\npresence of unwanted bodily fluids. In cases of urinary continence,\npads, or catheters if pads were not sufficient, would be used to create\na boundary against the unboundedness of the urine. In the case of\nunhealed, weeping wounds dressings were applied. When these\nboundaries were breached people present in the public areas would be\ntaken aside, back to their bedroom or to a bathroom, in order to\nreinstate the boundary. The signs of the body\u2019s breaching would be\ntaken away with a change into clean and dry clothes or the application\nof new wound dressings.\nSeparation of residents occurred spatially and through their adoption\nof different social roles. The spatial separation of residents was seen\nmost obviously in the four case study nursing homes, in the use of the\npublic and private spaces. One indication as to whether residents were\nset apart from the wider community was the extent to which particular\nresidents occupied the public areas of the nursing homes as opposed to\nspending time in their own rooms.\nFurther evidence of sequestration could be seen in the activities that\noccurred in the public spaces of the nursing homes. In the public\nlounges it was possible to observe a clear demarcation between the\nmore able and mentally alert residents and those who were confused\nand less alert. In one nursing home this separation was most marked,\nwith one bay of the lounge being occupied by the more able people and\nthe other bay being occupied by those who were not engaging in any\nactivity. This type of separation did in part reflect the physical layout\nof the nursing homes and the facilities they offered. If there was only\none lounge then the separation occurred within this room. If there was\nmore than one lounge, then the residents I observed were usually\nseparated into the two rooms according to their ability socially to\ninteract.\n330 Katherine Froggatt\nThe social roles occupied by residents were closely related to the\nspatial separation just described. As a consequence of the increasing\ndependency and need for nursing care that many residents demon-\nstrated towards the end of their lives, individuals whose condition was\ndeteriorating, or who were perceived by staff to be confused, would\ntake on a different social role within the nursing home. This could be\nseen mainly in a resident\u2019s decreasing presence in the public areas of a\nnursing home \u2013 the dining room or lounge \u2013 or participation in\nrecreational activities, and in a resident\u2019s increasing presence in his or\nher bedroom:\nAlison hasn\u2019t been down to the lounge for some time. And I could, I could\nharness her. She was fairly flighty, and would come in and fly out, but I could\nharness her on occasions, and she would join in. But she\u2019s not coming down\nany more, she\u2019s not well enough. (Parkleigh Nursing Home, recreational\ncoordinator)\nRecreational activities usually took place within the lounge or another\npublic room, and the level of participation would depend upon\npersonal choice for those people able to decide. For those residents who\ncould not communicate their needs, the location they found themselves\nin within the lounge would determine their level of participation.\nThose residents sitting close to the activity would be able to take part\nmore easily, whereas those who were seated on the edges of the room,\nwould be passively present rather than actively involved.\nIndividuals residing within nursing homes could and did choose to\nset themselves apart from the wider nursing home community. The\ndegree to which they set themselves apart varied and was one\nindication of the social roles adopted by particular residents. Some\nspent their day in the public areas, others would only leave their\nbedroom for meals in the dining room, whereas others again would\nremain in their rooms all the time. In the following example, a\nregistered nurse describes one resident who preferred to remain in her\nroom all day, even at meal times.\nBut, for some, they don\u2019t want anything. They just want to be comfortable,\nlike Nancy for example. She may just want to sit in a room, watch a television,\nhave her visitors, do her knitting and talk to you when you go in, if you haven\u2019t\nnoticed. That\u2019s her life, she\u2019s happy \u2013 she was doing that at home. (Daisey\nLodge Nursing Home, registered nurse 3)\nResidents who remained in their bedrooms might not be engaged with\nsocial roles within the nursing home, but could be focused on life\nwithout the nursing home, through visiting, letters or telephone contact\nwith family and friends.\nLife and death in English nursing homes 331\nConclusions\nThe relationship between life and death in nursing homes is\nproblematic. An institution provides well-bounded space to contain\nevidence of ageing and dying amongst older people, thereby\nsequestering people from wider society. Within the institution, however,\nthe boundary is less clear. Living and dying occur in the same space,\nand staff members are required to care for residents, whatever their\nposition on this continuum.\nIn using the concept of sequestration to explore the relationship\nbetween life and death, there was evidence in these nursing homes of\nthe separation of residents both spatially and socially. Depending upon\ntheir degree of dependency and their underlying physical or mental\ncondition, different spatial places were occupied and roles adopted.\nThe uncertainty inherent in the passage from life to death for many\nolder people who reside in nursing homes shaped the nature of the\nseparation. Sequestration in these nursing homes was marked less by a\nclear separation of living residents from those who were dying than by\nthe creation of transitional states between the two polarities that could\nbe occupied by residents temporarily or permanently, often for many\nweeks and months.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the editor and two referees for their helpful comments.\nReferences\nBlackburn, A.
