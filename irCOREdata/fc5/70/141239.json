For the lowest porosity level, ~ 1.8% achieved following vacuum heat\ntreatment, the passive current density was identical to that of bulk titanium.\nHowever, electrochemical measurements of the coatings showed significant substrate\ninfluence when the interconnected porosity of the coating was 11.3 vol. % but a\ndecreased substrate influence with a porosity level of 5.9 vol. %. In the latter case\nthe OCP was still around 250 mV below that of bulk Ti. Salt spray tests confirmed\nthese electrochemical findings and showed the formation of surface corrosion\nproducts following 24 hours exposure.\n31 Introduction\nTitanium metal has excellent corrosion resistance in a number of aqueous media\nincluding salt water due to the presence of a tenacious oxide film [1] and so\ntitanium and its alloys have been used in a number of situations to protect steel\nstructures and components from attack [2]. However, deposition of protective\ncoatings of titanium by thermal spraying processes is problematic due to the fact\nthat titanium reacts readily with oxygen to form TiO2 at elevated temperature. Hence\nthe resultant coatings contain features such as oxide inclusions and interconnected\npores which prevent the realization of the protective capabilities of titanium as a\nbarrier coating. Indeed, a barrier coating needs to be entirely free from\ninterconnected porosity to provide reliable corrosion protection. In the case of\nthermally sprayed coatings, a number of studies to evaluate corrosion behavior have\nbeen performed. For example, Zhao et al. [3] investigated the behavior of titanium\nwhich was arc sprayed in air and found that oxides and nitrides present in the\ncoating degraded the corrosion resistance. Also a study by Ishikawa et al. [4] found\nthat flame sprayed titanium coatings did not provide corrosion protection due to the\nhigh level of coating porosity. To avoid the problem of the reaction of titanium with\nthe environment vacuum plasma and shrouded air plasma spraying have both been\nemployed to deposit coatings [5, 6]. However, a corrosion study of shrouded plasma\nsprayed titanium coatings in salt solution by Kinos et al. [6] using potentiodynamic\nmethods indicated that coating porosity significantly increased the corrosion rate\ncompared to bulk titanium. More recently Kuroda and co-workers [7, 8] have\nreported the development of a modified high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) process\n4termed warm spraying which is reportedly capable of producing titanium coatings\nwith porosity levels less than 1%. However, the corrosion rates of these warm\nsprayed coatings were also higher than bulk titanium because of the presence of\ninterconnected porosity.\nEvidently, there is considerable interest in developing corrosion resistant titanium\ncoatings as barrier layers and so more recently much attention has focused on using\nthe cold spray process to deposit titanium coatings. As an emerging technology, cold\nspray is being used increasingly to spray materials at high deposition rates in which\nsignificant particle melting is avoided [9-11]. It has been found that metals such as\ncopper can be deposited to produce coatings free from porosity as determined by\nopen circuit potential tests [12]. Hence, there is now a growing interest in cold spray\ndeposition of titanium with a significant body of work on titanium coatings and the\neffect of process parameters such as powder type, gas pressure, temperature and\ntype of gas on deposit characteristics including porosity [11, 13-19]. A wide range of\nporosity values in cold sprayed titanium coatings has been reported in literature (24-\n0.5%), most of which was measured using image analysis techniques [11, 15-17,\n19]. The porosity of the coatings reported in the literature depends on the process\nparameters, type of process gas and limitations of the spraying system. In general,\nhigher in-flight particle velocity achieved from helium as a process gas resulted in a\ndenser titanium coatings [18]. However, corrosion studies of cold sprayed titanium\ncoatings are much less extensive. Wang et al. [2, 11] showed that the corrosion rate\nof coated steel substrates in salt solution was higher than bulk titanium due to\ninterconnected porosity. However, there is no published data on the corrosion\nbehavior of cold sprayed free standing titanium deposits to the knowledge of the\n5authors. Furthermore, there is little attention given in the literature to quantifying\nthe porosity of cold sprayed titanium by techniques other than image analysis of\nmicrographs and in relating the porosity to corrosion behaviour in aqueous solutions.\nTherefore the aim of this study was to quantify and characterize the porosity of cold\nsprayed titanium deposits by mercury intrusion porosimetry and to investigate the\nrole of porosity in the corrosion behavior in salt water of both free standing titanium\ndeposits and coatings on a steel substrate. Moreover, for comparative purposes, free\nstanding deposits were heat treated to reduce their porosity and the effect of this\nwas also evaluated.\n2 Experimental Methods\n2.1 Materials\nCommercially pure inert gas atomized titanium powder (LPW, Cheshire, UK) was\nused to produce the deposits. The feedstock powder was spherical in shape with only\na very small fraction exhibiting satellite particles (Figure 1a). The particle size\nanalysis measured by laser diffractometry (Malvern Mastersizer S, Malvern\nInstruments, Worcestershire, UK) showed that 90% of the particles were in the\nsupplier specified size range of -30+ 10 \u00b5m with approximately 10 vol. % below 10\n\u00b5m (Figure 1b). The titanium powder was deposited onto carbon steel samples\n(0.037 wt.% C, 0.17 wt.% Mn, 0.01 wt.% P, 0.02 wt.% S and balance Fe) of\ndimensions 40 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 2 mm.\n62.2 Cold gas spraying of titanium\nThe coatings and free standing deposits were prepared with a CGTTM Kinetiks\u00ae\n4000\/47 system at TWI Ltd. The de Laval nozzle had a length of 170 mm and a\nthroat diameter of 2.7 mm with an area expansion ratio of ~6.5. The system utilized\nheated nitrogen gas both for the primary accelerating gas and the powder carrier\ngas. A high pressure powder feeder (CGT) was used during the cold spraying process\nwith a carrier gas flow-rate of 3.7 m3\/h and powder feeder wheel speed of 3.5 rpm\ngiving an approximate powder feedrate of 1.6 kg\/h. The nozzle-substrate standoff\ndistance for all the spray conditions was fixed at 40 mm.\nThe deposition conditions for the samples are presented in Table 1. The carbon\nsteel substrates sprayed at 600 \u00b0C were grit blasted in a conventional manual grit\nblasting cabinet at 2.75 bar with a grit size of ~125 \u00b5m. It was not possible to\nproduce a well bonded coating onto a cabinet grit blasted carbon steel surface at the\nhigher gas temperature. Hence, a more controlled grit blasting process using the cold\nspraying gun, which was mounted on a six axis robot, was used at 25 bar with a grit\nsize of 45-90 \u00b5m. The substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in a bath of acetone for\n15 minutes, rinsed with methyl alcohol and dried using compressed air immediately\nprior to spraying. Substrates were then clamped in a vice and the gun, mounted on\nthe six axis robot manipulator scanned the surface of the samples at 600 mm\/s. The\nincrement of the scan was set at 0.75 mm. The deposits were built up using four\npasses of the gun.\n7A free standing deposit was obtained by carefully delaminating a coating from the\nsteel substrate. The deposit sprayed at 600 \u00b0C gas temperature is referred to as free\nstanding deposit FS1 and when coated onto carbon steel as C1. The deposit sprayed\nat 800 \u00b0C gas temperature is referred to as free standing deposit FS2, and when\ncoated onto carbon steel as C2 in this paper.\n2.3 Post spray heat treatment\nFree standing deposits were sealed in a quartz tube under a vacuum of 10-4 Torr to\navoid oxidation. The heat treatment was performed at 1050 \u00b0C for 60 minutes in a\nrapid heating furnace (Carbolite, Sheffield, UK) at a heating rate of 50 K\/min. The\nheat treatment temperature was 150 K above the \u03b2-transus temperature of\ncommercially pure titanium. Following heat treatment, the quartz tube was air cooled\nto room temperature.\n2.4 Corrosion tests\nPotentiodynamic electrochemical tests of free standing titanium deposits and\ncoatings were carried out using an ACM Gill 8 sequencer (ACM Instruments,\nCumbria, UK) in a standard 3 electrode cell. A platinum metal strip of 100 mm2 was\nused as an auxiliary electrode and the cell temperature was maintained at 30\u00b11\u00b0C\nusing a water bath. All the potentials were measured with respect to an Ag\/AgCl\nsecondary electrode. The samples were tested in a solution of 3.5 wt. % NaCl in de-\nionized water and a flow of nitrogen gas was maintained at 0.1 L\/min during the full\nduration of the experiments. Nitrogen flowed through the solution for 30 minutes\nbefore the start of the test to stabilize the cell.\n8The substrate side of the free standing samples was lightly ground to remove any\nresidual steel. The as-sprayed top surface of each sample was ground to P1200 grit\nfinish to remove the top porous layer. The samples were painted with a stopping off\nlacquer to expose only 100 mm2 for testing. Finally, the sample surfaces were\ndegreased using methanol, cleaned with deionized water and dried immediately\nbefore immersion.\nThe open circuit potential (OCP) of the specimens was measured during the first 60\nminutes of immersion before starting the potentiodynamic scans. To conduct the\npolarization scans the samples were first lowered to a potential of 200 mV below the\nopen circuit potential and then scanned at a rate of 20 mV\/ min in the anodic\ndirection. The scans were stopped when the potential of the samples reached an\nupper limit of 1800 mV above the rest potential, Ecorr. The intersection of the anodic\nand cathodic linear extrapolations at the rest potential of potentiodynamic\npolarization scans (Tafel extrapolation) was taken as the corrosion current density,\nIcorr. The passive current density, Ipp was taken as the current density of the\npassive region from the potentiodynamic polarization scans.\nReproducibility of the corrosion measurements was evaluated by running repeat tests\non both free standing deposits and coatings. Three separate samples of free standing\ndeposit FS1 and three samples of coating C2 were tested under the same conditions.\nThe variations in measured values of the three free standing FS1 deposits were as\nfollows: OCP \uf0b1 30 mV; Ecorr \uf0b1 2.5 mV; Ipp \uf0b1 0.005 mA\/cm2 and Icorr \uf0b1 0.0005\nmA\/cm2. The variations in measured values of the three C2 coatings were as follows:\nOCP \uf0b1 13 mV; Ecorr \uf0b1 30 mV; Ipp \uf0b1 0.025 mA\/cm2 and Icorr \uf0b1 0.0005 mA\/cm2.\n9These values are well within the typical range of experimental in electrochemical\nstudies of this type. Therefore graphs of typical open circuit potential changes with\ntime and potentiodynamic polarization scans for each sample are presented in this\nstudy.\nSalt spray (fog) tests were performed for 24 hours on coatings sprayed onto carbon\nsteel with a dimension of 25 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 2.5 mm using a 5 wt. % NaCl solution. The back\nand the sides of the samples were covered with a red stopping off lacquer (toluene)\nto avoid any galvanic corrosion and only the top of the coating surface was exposed.\n2.5 Sample preparation and characterization\nCoating cross-sections were prepared by cutting with a diamond slitting wheel. The\nsamples were sequentially ground using SiC paper and polished with 10:1 colloidal\n(0.1 \u00b5m) silica suspension and H2O2 on a MD-Chem cloth (Struers UK). Samples\nwere examined by both optical and scanning electron microscopy. A FEI XL30 (FEI\nEurope, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating\nat 20 keV was employed to examine the microstructure of the coatings using\nsecondary electron (SE) imaging. The coatings were lightly etched in Krolls etchant\n(2% HF, 5% HNO3 and 95% H2O) for 15 seconds prior to examination in the\nmicroscope. The etching time needs to be kept constant as the etch attacks the\nmicrostructure and affects the visible features. The morphology of the powders and\ndeposit top surfaces was also examined in the SEM using SE imaging.\n10\nThe porosity of the free standing deposits was measured using a mercury intrusion\nporosimeter (Autopore IV, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). There are two ports in\nthe porosimeter: a low pressure port and a high pressure port. The low pressure port\nevacuates any air trapped inside the sample and then fills it with mercury at 0.14\nMPa. The sample is then transferred to the high pressure port where the mercury\ninfiltrates the sample at pressures up to 415 MPa. Free standing deposits of\ndimension 10\u00d7 8\u00d7 1 mm were used for the mercury intrusion tests. Mercury\nintrusion porosimetry (MIP) can only be used to measure the open porosity which is\nconnected to the surface of the deposits. Results are presented in the form of\nintrusion volume of mercury per gram of sample versus pressure where pore\ndiameter is then calculated from the pressure values using Washburn\u2019s equation.\nD = - \uf06a\uf067 cos41 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\nP\nequation 1\nWhere D is the pore diameter, P is the applied pressure, \u03b3 is the surface tension of \nmercury, and \u03c6 is the contact angle. Total mercury intrusion (mL\/g) values were \nconverted to volume percentages of porosity of the deposits assuming that the\ndensity of titanium is 4500 kg\/m3.\n11\n3 Results\n3.1 Microstructure and corrosion behavior of free standing\ndeposits\n3.1.1 Microstructure of cold sprayed titanium\nThe microstructure (unetched) of cold sprayed titanium sprayed at 600 \u00b0C (C1) and\n800 \u00b0C (C2) process gas temperatures onto carbon steel are shown in Figures 2 (a,\nb). The microstructure of the coating C1 shows a porous top layer of 150 \u00b5m and a\nlower porosity bottom layer. The top porous layer is not as obvious in coating C2\nwhich was sprayed at a higher process gas temperature. This porous top layer\nformation in cold sprayed titanium coating is similar to that reported previously by\nother researchers [13, 14]. The coatings do not show cracking or any delamination\nalong the coating-substrate interface, but do show the presence of fractured alumina\n(darker contrast) from the surface preparation methods. The thickness of coating C1\nwas 900 \u00b5m, whereas the thickness of coating C2 was 550 \u00b5m. This difference in\ncoating thickness could be due to irregularities in powder feeding, although the\nnominal powder feed rate and gun traverse speed in both cases were the same.\nFigures 2 (c, d) show higher magnification images of etched as-sprayed free\nstanding deposits FS1 and FS2 taken from near the mid-plane of the coating. The\nmicrostructure is made up of a mixture of different sized particles, and voids are\nobserved in both coatings at the interparticle boundaries. These voids are not visible\nin the unetched sample and result from loss of particles due to the attack of the\nparticle boundaries by the etchant. In a number of places the initial spherical shape\n12\nof the titanium powder particle was retained which indicates a lower degree of plastic\ndeformation in FS1. These areas are marked with circles in Figure 2c. However, in\nFigure 2d more extreme particle deformation is apparent (see circled regions).\nBecause etching attacks the particle boundaries a prolonged etching results in losing\nparticles from the deposits, so the \u201capparent\u201d porosity depends on the duration of\netching. Also in unetched samples smearing of Ti during sample preparation can lead\nto an underestimate of porosity. Optical microscopy is thus an unreliable way of\ndetermining overall porosity in cold sprayed titanium coatings [20]. This is why\nmercury intrusion porosimetry was used to quantify the \u201cactual\u201d porosity in this\nstudy.\nThe free standing deposits FS1 and FS2, after heat treatment at 1050\u00b0C , are shown\nin Figures 2 (e, f) following etching. Most of the interparticle pores in FS2 deposit\nwere eliminated following heat treatment due to recrystallization and grain growth at\nhigher temperature, but a number of isolated regions of defects were still present in\nFS1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of both as-sprayed and heat treated deposits\nshowed the presence of only \u03b1-Ti. No secondary phases were present within the\nlimits of XRD sensitivity (i.e. 1-2 vol. %). Figure 3 shows higher magnification\nsecondary electron (SE) images of the deposits before and after heat treatment. The\npores in as-sprayed FS1 and FS2 deposits (Figures 3a, b) are mostly at the\ninterparticle boundaries and the gas atomized titanium powder particles show little\nevidence for pores within them. The heat treated free standing FS1 deposit shows a\nreduction of interparticle voids and spheriodization of pores (Figure 3c).\nInterparticle boundaries, nearly free from defects, were observed following heat\n13\ntreatment of FS2 and formation of metallurgical bonds at the interparticle splats\n(boxed region in Figure 3d).\nFigures 4 (a, b) show the as-sprayed top surface view of free standing deposits FS1\nand FS2. The top surface of free standing deposit FS1 shows a higher surface\nroughness which corresponds to the top porous layer in the cross-sectional image in\nFigure 2a. Top surface of FS1 had a surface roughness (Ra) value of 8 \u00b5m and top\nsurface of FS2 had a surface roughness (Ra) value of 4\u00b5m. Figures 4 (c, d) show\nhigher magnification images of free standing deposits FS1 and FS2. FS1 deposit\nshows smaller titanium particles deposited onto larger titanium particles, and in\nsome places, on larger particles, there is evidence of sliding and rebounding after\nimpact. Rupture of the bonding of a titanium particle is also observed in the image,\nmarked with boxes in the Figure 4c. In Figure 4d, the shear lips of titanium\nparticles where the plastic flow of titanium occurred following the occurrence of\nadiabatic shear instability phenomena are marked with arrows [21]. There is no\nevidence for re-bounding or ruptured bonding in this figure. Lower magnification\nimages of heat treated top surfaces of free standing titanium deposits FS1 and FS2\nare shown in Figures 4 (e, f). The heat treated deposits show new grain growth and\nelimination of previous particle boundaries. Heat treated free standing FS1 (Figure\n4e) shows larger intergrain voids compared to heat treated FS2 (Figure 4f).\nFigures 4 (g, h) show higher magnification images of heat treated free standing\ndeposits FS1 and FS2. In both deposits, grain growth following heat treatment shows\na reduction of pores with the formation of faceted grain boundaries.\n14\n3.1.2 Porosity of free standing deposits\nMercury intrusion porosimetry was used to characterize the open pore size\ndistribution of the FS1 and FS2 deposits, before and after heat treatment. Figure 5a\nshows the incremental mercury intrusion with respect to pore sizes of FS1 and FS2\ndeposits before and after heat treatment. The as-sprayed FS1 deposit has a pore\nsize distribution of 0.3 - 8 \u00b5m. Heat treatment of FS1 altered the pore size range to\n0.6 - 2.5 \u00b5m. The majority of the pores in the FS2 deposit were in the size range of\n0.18 - 1.6 \u00b5m with a smaller number of very fine pores of size 0.003 - 0.004 \u00b5m.\nHeat treatment of FS2 showed a virtual complete elimination of larger pores and\nresulted in formation of very small pores of 0.006 \u00b5m to 0.013 \u00b5m.\nFigure 5b shows the cumulative intrusion of mercury per gram of sample versus\npore diameter. The cumulative intrusion for the as-sprayed FS1 deposit was 0.025\nmL\/g with a sharp increase of cumulative intrusion curve at 2-3 \u00b5m pore sizes. The\nlarger pores are filled up with mercury at lower pressure and smaller pores are\ninfiltrated at higher pressure. Following heat treatment of FS1, the total amount of\nintruded mercury decreased to 0.01 mL\/g, i.e. decrease in the total pore volume.\nThe cumulative intrusion of as-sprayed FS2 deposit was 0.013 mL\/g, which is half\nthe amount compared to as-sprayed FS1 deposit (0.025 mL\/g). The slope of the FS2\ncumulative intrusion curve sharply increases at the pore sizes of 1-2 \u00b5m. After heat\ntreatment, FS2 deposit exhibited a cumulative intrusion of only 0.004 mL\/g. The\nequivalent volume percentages of porosity from mercury intrusion tests are shown in\nTable 2. The last two columns of the table show the volume percentages of porosity\nof the deposits corresponding to pore sizes below and above 1 \u00b5m. In as-sprayed\nand heat treated FS1, the pore sizes above 1 \u00b5m accounted for the majority of the\n15\nporosity. However, in the as-sprayed and heat treated FS2 deposit, the pores smaller\nthan 1 \u00b5m accounted for the majority of the porosity. Evidently optical microscopy\ncan only detect pores of diameter approximately \uf0b3 1 \u00b5m and so will not detect these\nvery fine pores.\n3.1.3 Open circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization of free\nstanding deposits\nFigure 6a shows the typical open circuit potential (OCP) measurements of bulk\ntitanium, as-sprayed free standing deposit FS1, and heat treated free standing\ndeposit FS1 in 3.5% NaCl solution for 3600 seconds. The bulk titanium reached a\nsteady state OCP of -220 mV with respect to Ag\/AgCl electrode within a few minutes\nof immersion. Both the open circuit potentials of as-sprayed and heat treated free\nstanding FS1 deposits were ~-530 mV (Ag\/AgCl).\nFigure 6b shows typical potentiodynamic polarization scans of the bulk titanium, as-\nsprayed free standing deposit FS1, and heat treated free standing FS1 deposit. The\nscan of bulk titanium showed typical active-passive behavior of a passivating metal.\nBulk titanium had a passivation range of 250 mV to 1250 mV, after which it showed\ntrans-passive behavior. The passive current density (Ipp) of bulk titanium was 0.005\nmA\/cm2. The as-sprayed free standing FS1 deposit showed \u201cpassive-like\u201d behavior\nfrom 70mV to 1250 mV, during which the current density increased from 0.017\nmA\/cm2 to 0.13 mA\/cm2. It also reached the limiting voltage value during the\npotentiodynamic polarization scan before the onset of trans-passive behavior. The\nheat treatment of free standing deposit FS1 resulted in a decrease of passive current\n16\ndensity to 0.007 mA\/cm2. The Ecorr of both the as-sprayed deposit FS1 and heat\ntreated deposit FS1 lie around ~580mV, but the Icorr value showed a decrease of\ntwo orders of magnitude after the heat treatment. The Ecorr and Icorr values of all\nthe samples are shown in Table 3.\nOpen circuit potential measurements of as-sprayed and heat treated FS2 in 3.5 wt.\n% NaCl solution are shown in Figure 7a. The open circuit potential of as-sprayed\nFS2 was -510 mV and that of heat treated FS2 was -365 mV. The heat treatment of\nfree standing deposit FS2 resulted in a shift of ~145 mV in the more positive\ndirection, towards the bulk titanium. This is a significant difference from the behavior\nof heat treated FS1.\nFigure 7b shows the potentiodynamic polarization of as-sprayed and heat treated\nFS2 deposit. These showed similar passive current density (0.005 mA\/cm2) to bulk\ntitanium. The Ecorr values of the as-sprayed and heat treated FS2 deposits showed\nsimilar trends to OCP measurements. The Icorr value of the heat treated FS2 deposit\nreduced to 3 \u00d7 10-5 mA\/cm2 from 2 \u00d7 10-4 mA\/cm2 following heat treatment.\n3.2 Corrosion behavior of coatings onto carbon steel\nFigure 8a shows the open circuit potential of as-sprayed C1 (porosity ~11 vol.%)\nand C2 (porosity ~6 vol.%) coatings onto carbon steel, bulk titanium and bulk\ncarbon steel for 3600 seconds. Open circuit potential of bulk titanium was -220mV\nand carbon steel reached a steady open circuit potential of -750 mV after 1200\nseconds of immersion. As-sprayed C1 coating onto carbon steel reached a steady\n17\nstate open circuit potential of -700mV after 200 seconds of immersion and remained\nat that level during the full length of the experiment. As-sprayed C2 coating onto\ncarbon steel showed a decreasing trend in open circuit potential measurements,\nwhich started at -320mV upon immersion and gradually dropped to -500mV after\n3600 seconds.\nPotentiodynamic polarization scans of C1 and C2 coatings onto carbon steel, bulk\ntitanium and carbon steel are shown in Figure 8b. C1 coating showed an Icorr\nvalue of 3.5 \u00d7 10-3 mA\/cm2 and Ecorr value of -836 mV; and C2 coating showed an\nIcorr value of 2 \u00d7 10-3 mA\/cm2 and Ecorr value of -603 mV (Table 3). C1 coating\nonto carbon steel showed \u201cpassive like\u201d corrosion current density of 1.1 mA\/cm2 and\nC2 coating onto carbon steel showed a value of 0.7 mA\/cm2; these are around two\norders of magnitude greater than bulk titanium passive current density of 0.005\nmA\/cm2. A piece of carbon steel substrate was also tested under similar conditions\nfor reference. Carbon steel had an Icorr value of 3 \u00d7 10-3 mA\/cm2 and Ecorr value of\n-750mV. The current density of carbon steel increased rapidly with overpotential and\nreached a limiting value of 1000 mA\/cm2 at 1050 mV.\nFigures 9 (a,b) show the top surface of C1 coating after potentiodynamic\npolarization at low and high magnifications. The optical microscope image of Figure\n9a shows evidence of localized corrosion on the sample surface, where the\nelectrolyte percolated through the coating and attacked the carbon steel substrate.\nFigure 9b shows a higher magnification SEM image of one of the localized corrosion\nregions. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis in the SEM of the boxed region showed\npresence of iron, oxygen, sodium and chlorine on the titanium coating surface.\n18\nFigures 10 (a, b) show the salt spray (fog) test results of C1 and C2 coatings onto\ncarbon steel after 24 hours of exposure. C1 coating showed severely attacked pits on\nthe surface, where distinctive yellow rust from the corrosion of carbon steel\nsubstrate was present. The surface of C2 coating showed a large number of small\ncorrosion spots after the test. The coating C2 shows uniformly distributed corrosion\nproduct over the entire surface as opposed to a few large corrosion pits in the C1\ncoating.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Microstructure and porosity of titanium\nAlthough it is possible to produce a pore free microstructure using cold spray from\nductile face centered cubic copper [22], it is more difficult to produce a pore free\ndeposit from titanium. Titanium may be more difficult to densify in cold spraying due\nto its hexagonal closed pack (hcp) crystal structure and its lower density [16, 23]. A\nless deformed top porous layer is clearly observed in the deposits sprayed at 600 \u00b0C,\nwhereas, this porous layer is less evident in the deposits sprayed at 800 \u00b0C. It can\nbe argued that there are two effects taking place at the higher process gas\ntemperature. First, the particles reach a higher in-flight velocity due to a higher Mach\nnumber inside the gun and secondly, the particles reach a higher temperature in the\ngas stream. According to the energy balance theory the initial kinetic energy of a\nparticle before impact is the sum of the energy dissipated as plastic deformation plus\nrecoverable strain energy [24]. A higher particle velocity results in a greater kinetic\n19\nenergy which enhances plastic deformation. Also heating of the particles changes the\ninitial state of impacting bodies due to thermal softening that results in a decrease of\nflow stress. Also, the porosity of titanium deposits decreases with increasing the\ndistance from the coating top surface because the particles at the bottom of the\ncoating experience more of a peening effect than the particles deposited at the top\nsurface [13].\nThe shear lips of the titanium particles observed at the top surface of the coating\nsprayed at 800 \u00b0C process gas temperature (Figure 4d) can be attributed to the\nhighly localized temperature increase at the impacting interface due to a relatively\nlow thermal conductivity and a low diffusivity of titanium [15]. During this high strain\nrate plastic deformation of titanium, much of the work done is converted to heat\n[25]. On the other hand, partial bonding and ruptured bonds in the deposits sprayed\nat 600 \u00b0C (Figure 4c) can be attributed to elastic relief on unloading during the\nimpact phenomena [26]. These differences in deformation of the particles and\nthermal softening resulted in an open porosity of ~6 vol. % in the deposits sprayed\nat 800 \u00b0C compared to ~11 vol. % of the deposits sprayed at 600 \u00b0C as determined\nfrom MIP.\nIt was evidenced from the micrographs, Figures 4 (g, h), that heat treatment of\nfree standing titanium deposits above the \u03b2 transus temperature resulted in grain\ngrowth and reduction in porosity. Titanium has an adherent oxide (TiO2) layer which\nhas to be disrupted to form metallurgical bonds [20, 27]. Moreover, the oxide layer\non the metal surface acts as a diffusion barrier for many metals but TiO2 does not\nhinder the formation of metallurgical bonds during heat treatment because both \u03b1 \n20\nand \u03b2 phases of titanium are known to dissolve oxygen interstitially [28]. Therefore, \nduring vacuum heat treatment new grains were formed and grain growth took place,\nwhich eliminated the sprayed particle boundaries [29]. Consequently, the\ninterparticle pores in the as-sprayed deposits were pinned down at the new grain\nboundaries. In summary, heat treatment resulted in a reduction of open porosity in\nFS1 from ~11 vol. % to ~5 vol. % and in FS2 from ~6 vol. % to ~2 vol. %.\nMercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) measured the interconnected porosity of the as-\nsprayed and the heat treated free standing deposits down to a few nm of pore sizes,\nestimated from equation 1. This is well below the resolution of an optical microscope.\nIf an optical microscope with a typical resolution of 1 \u00b5m were to be used to measure\nthe porosity of heat treated FS2, the deposit would appear to have a porosity of only\n~ 0.2% because the sub-micron pores would not be resolved (Table 2). However,\nthe majority of the pores in the heat treated FS2 were of sub-micron sizes which\naccount for a porosity of 1.6 vol. %. Moreover, MIP has a unique advantage in\nmeasuring the volume percentage of porosity in cold sprayed coatings compared\nwith thermally sprayed metals because the formation of oxide can be neglected.\nTherefore MIP cumulative intrusion values can readily be converted to volume\npercentage of porosity using the known density of metallic Ti. In thermally sprayed\ncoatings, the volume percentage and density of any oxide inclusions also need to be\nknown before the cumulative intrusion values in mL of mercury per gram of sample\ncan be converted to volume percentage of porosity.\n21\n4.2 Corrosion behavior of free standing deposits\nIn thermally sprayed coatings, open circuit potential (OCP) measurements and\npotentiodynamic polarization scans have been widely used to evaluate the corrosion\nbehavior [30-33]. In the present potentiodynamic experiments, heat treated FS1,\nas-sprayed FS2, and heat treated FS2 deposits show a passive current density\nsimilar to the bulk titanium, which means that the change in porosity level from ~6\nvol. % to ~2 vol. % does not have a significant effect on the passive current density.\nHowever, the as-sprayed free standing deposit FS1 with a porosity of ~11 vol. %\nshows an increased passive current density (by 1-2 orders of magnitude). This could\nbe due to an increase in \u201ctrue surface area\u201d taking part in the corrosion reactions. In\nsupport of this, a similar increase in passive current density with increasing porosity\nin sintered and warm sprayed titanium has also been reported in literature [7, 34].\nMoreover, in contrast to APS, arc, or flame sprayed titanium deposits, cold sprayed\ntitanium deposits are apparently free from oxides and nitrides, and hence the\nincrease in passive current density is unlikely to arise from the presence of such\nphases. In this study, the open circuit potentials of all the deposits show more\nnegative values compared to the bulk titanium, which means that the deposits had\nactive surfaces and higher thermodynamic tendency to corrosion [3]. Also, the open\ncircuit potentials of the deposits did not show any decreasing trend with time\nbecause of the stability of the protective oxide film [35]. Also it would appear that\nopen circuit potentials and Ecorr values are more sensitive to small amounts of\nporosity than are passive current densities. In Figure 7a, the heat treated deposit\nFS2 is seen to be cathodic with respect to bulk titanium whereas Figure 7b shows\nan identical passive current density.\n22\nCorrosion current density (Icorr) is directly proportional to the corrosion rate of the\nmaterial and in this study, potentiodynamic polarization scans showed that Icorr of\nfree standing deposit FS2 (~6 vol. % porosity) is an order of magnitude smaller than\nFS1 (~11 vol. %). In addition, heat treatment of both FS1 and FS2 deposits reduced\nthe Icorr by 1-2 orders of magnitude. It was reported in several studies that\ncorrosion performance of sprayed deposits improved following heat treatment [31,\n36]. Heat treatment of porous titanium deposits eliminates the smaller pores to\nproduce a more homogenous structure and the surface oxide of the particles is\nremoved during heat treatment in a vacuum [36]. Moreover, cold sprayed deposits\ncontain highly deformed particles because of the high velocity impacts and high\nstrain rate plastic deformation of the particles [37]. These highly deformed particles\ncould act as preferential sites for corrosion [9]. Heat treatment of the as-sprayed\ndeposits also eliminates these high stressed regions and thus reduces the\npreferential corrosion attack.\n4.3 Corrosion behavior of coatings onto carbon steel\nOpen circuit potential is widely used as a method to assess the effect of\ninterconnected porosity in sprayed coatings [2, 10, 33]. A barrier coating layer will\nshow an open circuit potential very close to that of the coating material whereas a\nporous coating, that allows the corrosive liquid to attack the substrate, will show an\nopen circuit potential closer to the substrate material. In this study, both the coated\nsamples C1 and C2 had open circuit potential values in between bulk titanium and\ncarbon steel substrate, which indicates salt solution percolation through the coatings.\nAs-sprayed C2 coating (porosity ~6 vol. %) had an open circuit potential closer to\nbulk titanium for first few hundred seconds and then the open circuit potential\ndecreased; presumably when the solution started percolating through the coating\n23\nand attacking the substrate. However, with C1 coating (porosity ~11 vol. %) the\nopen circuit potential decreased to the carbon steel value within few tens seconds of\nimmersion. Furthermore, C1 coating had a coarser pore size distribution (0.3- 8 \u00b5m)\nthan that of C2 (0.18- 1.6) which possibly allowed the solution to percolate through\nthe coating readily. It should also be mentioned that although C1 coating was thicker\nthan C2 coating, by around ~300 \u00b5m, this increased thickness did not provide any\nincreased corrosion resistance! Clearly, therefore less interconnected porosity in\ncoatings plays the major role in corrosion resistance over increased thickness.\nSalt spray test results also confirmed the lack of barrier like properties of coatings C1\nand C2 (Figures 10 a, b). It is clear that C1 coating, which had a higher porosity\nand larger pores, exhibited only a few but large corrosion spots compared to C2\ncoating. One explanation for this is that once the corrosion of the substrate started\ndue to galvanic effect, it had a higher driving force to continue corroding at the\nattacked sites instead of forming new pits. In aggressive environments like salt spray\ntest, micro galvanic cells are formed across the titanium- carbon steel interface\nwhich ultimately results in delamination of the coating.\nAs expected, potentiodynamic polarization scans of the coatings onto carbon steel\nresulted in a higher anodic corrosion current compared to the bulk titanium sheet.\nThese differences in current density were also due to the percolation of the solution\nthrough the coating. The lower amount of porosity in C2 coating compared to C1\nresulted in a decrease in anodic current. A study by Wang et al. [11] also showed\nthat cold sprayed titanium coating with a lower porosity resulted in a lower anodic\ncorrosion current in salt solution. However, the densest coating (1.6%) in that study,\n24\nwhich was measured using image analysis techniques, showed increased anodic\ncorrosion current (by two orders of magnitude) compared to bulk titanium.\nMoreover, this behavior of reduction of anodic current with decreasing porosity was\nalso observed in HVOF coatings and plasma sprayed titanium coatings because of a\nreduction in active corrosion sites on the substrate [36, 38].\nFuture work to improve the corrosion performance of cold sprayed titanium coating\nshould thus focus on enhancing the particle deformation during cold spraying to\nensure the elimination of even sub-micron porosity which cannot be observed in the\noptical microscope but is measurable using MIP. Surface treatment of the top layer\nof titanium coatings could also be investigated in order to achieve barrier coating\nproperties.\n5 Conclusions\nTitanium was deposited by cold gas dynamic spraying using two different process\nparameters designed to reduce porosity. The porosity of the deposits was\ncharacterized by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The deposits were heat treated to\nreduce porosity and the effect of porosity on the corrosion performance of free\nstanding titanium deposits was studied in 3.5 wt. % NaCl solution. Corrosion\nperformance of titanium coatings onto carbon steel was also investigated in the same\nsolution using electrochemical methods and salt spray tests. The following\nconclusions were drawn from the above study:\n25\n\uf0b7 Cold spraying using N2 as a process gas heated to 800 \u00b0C can deposit\ntitanium with less interconnected porosity than N2 gas at 600 \u00b0C due to a\nhigher degree of particle deformation on impact. Mercury intrusion\nporosimetry can be successfully used to measure total interconnected\nporosity, including sub-micron pores, in free standing deposits.\n\uf0b7 A pore free microstructure of titanium deposit could not be achieved from cold\nspraying alone. However, vacuum heat treatment of free standing titanium\ndeposits significantly reduced the interconnected porosity. Pores above 1 \u00b5m\nwere reduced to 0.2 vol. % and the total interconnected porosity to 1.8 vol.\n% following heat treatment of deposits produced at a process gas\ntemperature of 800 \uf0b0C.\n\uf0b7 Open circuit potentials (OCP) and rest potentials (Ecorr) are more sensitive to\nsmall amounts of porosity than are passive current densities (Ipp). However,\nOCP values of free standing titanium deposits were, in all cases, lower than\nthat of bulk titanium due to porosity even after vacuum heat treatment.\n\uf0b7 Electrochemical corrosion studies of the titanium coatings on carbon steel\nsubstrate showed significant substrate influence at the levels of porosity\narising from deposition at both 600 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C. Open circuit potentials\nand passive current densities of the coatings were significantly different from\nthat of bulk titanium due to the interconnected porosity. Salt spray tests also\nconfirmed the presence of interconnected porosity in these coatings.\nAcknowledgements\nT.
