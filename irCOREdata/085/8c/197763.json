Self-serving Lies and Other-oriented Lies told across Different \nMedia \n \n \nThe lie is a condition of life -- Nietzsche \n \nPsychologists have been very interested in the types of people who are more \nlikely to lie (Dike, Baranoski, & Griffith, 2005; Kashy & DePaulo, 1996), why people \nlie (Camden, Motley, & Wilson, 1984), the types of lies people tell (DePaulo, Kashy, \nKirkendol, Wyer, & Epstein, 1996), how frequently individuals lie (DePaulo et al., \n1996), to whom they tell their lies to (Williams, 2001), and, more recently, across \nwhich modes of communication individuals are more likely to lie in (Hancock, Thom-\nSantelli, & Ritchie, 2004). In this study we were interested in two types of lies: self-\nserving lies and other oriented lies, told over the phone, email, and face-to-face. \nTheories on Impression Management \nGoffman was interested in the ways people present themselves in their \neveryday face-to-face encounters. In his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday \nLife, Goffman (1959) argued for a dualistic image of the self. He described the self as \nboth a performer and a character. According to Goffman (1959) the \u2018self-as-\nperformer\u2019 is not merely a social product, but also has a basic motivational core which \nmotivates us. In contrast, the \u2018self-as-character\u2019 represents an individuals\u2019 unique \nhumanity. It is this part of the self which is a social product; that is, performed \noutwardly in social life. The \u2018self-as-character\u2019 is one\u2019s inner self. \nGoffman believed that individuals need to present themselves as an acceptable \nperson to others. He stated that \u201cthe impressions that the others give tend to be treated \nWould I lie 4 \nas claims and promises they have implicitly made, and claims and promises tend to \nhave a moral character\u201d (Goffman, 1959\/1997, p.21). He argued that individuals can \nbe strategic in their impression formation. In particular, Goffman was interested in \ndistinguishing between expressions \u2018given\u2019 (e.g., spoken communication) and \nexpressions \u2018given off\u2019 (e.g., nonverbal cues) in a face-to-face interaction. \n Theorists, such as DePaulo et al. (1996), have drawn from Goffman\u2019s theory \nto argue that \u201cmany of the lies of everyday life are told to avoid tension and conflict \nand to minimize hurt feelings and ill will\u201d (p.980). To test their claims they carried \nout two diary studies of lying. As predicted they found that lying is a part of daily life. \nImportantly, DePaulo et al. (1996) also found that the lies people told either served \nthe liars\u2019 own self-interests or were told to protect the person they were lying to \u2013 \nalthough most lies were self-serving ones. They also found that, in line with \nGoffman\u2019s theory, many of their participants lied to protect themselves from \nembarrassment, disapproval, or conflict rather than for material gain or personal \nadvantage. In addition, they regularly lied to protect the feelings of the targets of the \nlies.  \n1.2 Target of the Lie \nFew theorists have investigated whether lying varies depending on whom the \nlie is being told to. Should we expect that the types of lies told and frequency of \ntelling a lie varies according to the relationship one has with the person one is telling \nthe lie to? Some research has suggested this is the case. For example, DePaulo and \nKashy (1998) found that their participants reported telling fewer lies to people they \nwere close to and would feel uncomfortable when they did lie to these people. In \naddition, they found that relatively more of the lies told to best friends and friends \nwere altruistic rather than self-serving. Drawing again from Goffman\u2019s theory if one \nWould I lie 5 \nis to remain authentic in their friends eyes then one has to present a consistent image \nof the self; hence, it is more risky trying to sustain a credible character to one\u2019s friends \nif one tells them self-serving lies. Moreover, we would expect that individuals want to \nensure that those they care about maintain their dignity and consequently would be \nmore motivated to tell other-oriented lies to individuals one is close to. \n1.3 Lying across Different Mediums \nResearchers have began to investigate deception in cyberspace (e.g., \nBirchmeier, Joinson, & Dietz-Uhler, 2005; Caspi & Gorsky, 2006; Cornwell & \nLungern, 2001; Utz, 2005; Whitty, 2002; Whitty & Carr, 2006). Whitty (2002), for \ninstance, has found that lying is a ubiquitous phenomenon in chat rooms. She found \nthat 28% of male users lied about their gender. Cornwell and Lungern (2001) found \nthat 27.5% of their respondents lied online about their physical attractiveness, 22.5% \nabout their age, 17.5% about their background, and 15% about their interests. Utz \n(2005) found that online attractiveness deception was deemed more severe than \ngender switching and identity concealment. Interestingly, Caspi and Gorsky (2006) \nfound that 84% of their sample experienced enjoyment from telling a lie online. \nResearchers have also been interested in whether individuals are more like to \nlie in one medium more than another. An important study conducted by Hancock et \nal. (2004) suggests this is the case. These researchers examined lying in face-to-face \nsituations, over the phone, via instant messenger, and via email. Participants kept a \ndiary where they had to record their social interactions and lies for a week. They \nfound that the highest proportion of lies occurred on the phone and least in email.  \nHancock et al. (2004) contend that their results do not support theories, such \nas, \u2018The Social Distance Hypotheses\u2019 and \u2018Media Richness Theory\u2019. \u2018Social Distance \nTheory\u2019 argues that because lying makes individuals feel uncomfortable, they will \nWould I lie 6 \nchoose less rich media in order to maintain social distance between themselves and \nthe person they are lying to. In respect to the four types of media Hancock et al. \n(2004) examined, individuals would lie most in email, followed by instant messenger, \nfollowed by phone, and then face-to-face. \u2018Media Richness Theory\u2019, in contrast, \nsuggest that because lying is highly equivocal individuals elect to lie more in rich \nmedia, which includes multiple cue systems, immediate feedback, natural language, \nand message personalisation. Hence, this theory would predict that individuals would \nlie in face-to-face situations more, following by phone, instant messenger, and email. \nGiven the results yielded from their study, Hancock and colleagues (2004) \ndeveloped a new theory to explain lying across different media. They suggest that \nresearchers need to consider other dimensions besides richness and distance. In their \nnew \u2018Feature Based Theory\u2019, the additional dimensions they include are synchronous, \nrecordless, and distributed (i.e., not copresent) communication. This theory proposes \nthat the more synchronous and distributed, but the less recordable a medium is, the \nmore frequently lying should occur. One lies more in synchronous interactions, \nbecause the majority of lying is spontaneous and hence synchronous communication \nshould present more opportunities to lie. In recorded communication one is aware that \ntheir conservation is potentially kept or stored (e.g., in a saved email) and can be \nreferred to in future conversations; hence, one is less likely to lie if they are aware that \nthere is proof of their lie that can be referred to later. In media where participants are \nnot distributed deception should be constrained to some degree as some lies can be \nimmediately obvious (e.g., it is easier to lie in email saying one is writing a report \nwhen really one is actually playing a computer game). Hence, because telephone \nconversations are distributed, synchronous, and recordless, the most amount of lying \nshould take place in this media, as supported by their results. On the other hand, email \nWould I lie 7 \nis distributed, but not synchronous or recordless and therefore, as supported by their \nstudy, had the lowest rate of deception. \n1.4 Current Study \n This current study extends upon current literature on lying. Based on the above \nevidence, the following hypotheses were developed. \nH1: Individuals will be more likely to tell self-serving lies to individuals not well \n\u2013known to them than they are to tell self-serving lies to individuals close to them.  \nThis first hypothesis is based on Goffman\u2019s theory outlined earlier in this \npaper. Goffman (1959\/1997) discussed in detail the knowledge we have about \nothers and argued that we are more likely to know the \u2018inner self\u2019 of people who \nare close to us. Hence, one is much less likely to get caught out telling a self-\nserving lie to individuals not well-known to them. Moreover, individuals are more \nlikely to care about the opinion of people close to them and so if caught out telling \na self-serving they have much more to lose. \nH2: Individuals will be more likely to tell other-oriented lies to individuals close \nto them than they are to tell other-oriented lies to individuals not well-known to \nthem.  \nThis hypothesis is based on DePaulo et al.\u2019s (1996) work which found that \nmany lies are told to protect the feelings of the targets of the lies. If this argument \nis correct, we would expect individuals to tell people that are close to other-\noriented lies given that we would expect that they care more for these individuals \nthan they do for strangers. \nIn addition to testing out these hypotheses we wanted to examine whether \nHancock et al.\u2019s (2004) \u2018Feature Based\u2019 theory still holds when we also consider \nWould I lie 8 \nthe type of lie told as well as the target of the lie. To reiterate, his theory predicts \nthat people are more likely to lie in synchronous, distributed, and non-recordable \nmediums. Given this we hypothesized that: \nH3: Individuals are more likely to lie on the phone than in face-to-face settings. \nH4: Individuals are more likely to lie on the phone than in email. \nH5: Individuals are more likely to lie in face-to-face settings than they are in \nemail. \n2. Method \n2.1 Materials \nA survey was constructed for this study. Participants were initially asked to \nprovide information on their gender, age, and employment status. Following from \nthis, participants were expected to respond to twelve hypothetical scenarios. Six of the \nscenarios presented the participant with a \u2018self-serving\u2019 lie and six an \u2018other-oriented\u2019 \nlie. In six of the scenarios individuals had to imagine telling the lie to either someone \nclose to them and in the other six they had to imagine telling the lie to someone they \ndid not know well. Someone close to them was defined as \u201ca member of your family, \na friend, or a partner\u201d. In the scenarios the participant had to imagine stating the lie in \nface-to-face, phone, and email. In each scenario, participants had to rate the likelihood \nthat they would lie with \u20181\u2019 representing \u2018not likely to tell this lie\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 representing \n\u2018extremely likely to tell this lie\u2019. To give two examples: \n \nYou are having a face-to-face conversation with someone that you are \u2018close \nto\u2019 when they invite you to an event. You can think of something else you \nwould rather spend your time doing so you tell them that you can\u2019t make it to \nthe event, even though you can. \nWould I lie 9 \n \nYou receive an email from a person you don\u2019t know well. Within the email they \nask you if you think they look attractive. You don\u2019t think that they are \nattractive but you don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings so you email them back and \ntell them that they are attractive. \n \n2.2 Procedure \n After obtaining the approval of an ethics committee, psychology students \nenrolled in a large university in the UK were invited to participate in the study. \nParticipants initially were provided with a consent form and an information sheet \ndescribing the study and the kind of questions they would be asked. They were \nassured of anonymity and were informed that they could withdraw consent without \npenalty. Those who then wished to participate filled out the survey, which took \napproximately 10 minutes to complete. Participants were given an email and phone \nnumber to contact if they had any further queries about the study. They were also \ngiven the telephone number and an email address of the student counselling service \n(which is a free service to students) in case they experienced any distress from \ncompleting the survey (although we expected they would not). \n2.3 Participants \n The participants were 150 psychology undergraduate students, comprising of \n104 (69%) women and 46 (31%) men. Participants ranged between 18 and 25 years of \nage (M=19.75, SD=1.74). The majority of the sample was either unemployed (51%) \nor employed part-time (47%), with 1% being employed and 1% identifying as a house \nhusband\/wife. \n3.

Discussion \nThis study investigated the likelihood for individuals to tell self-serving and \nother-oriented lies across three different types of media, face-to-face, phone, and \nemail. It also examined telling these lies to individuals close to them and individuals \nnot well-known to them. In line with previous researchers, the means elicited in this \nstudy suggested that lying is a part of individuals\u2019 everyday lives. This study also \nsuggests that lying is ubiquitous across all three types of media. \n The results yielded in this study supported our hypotheses. As predicted we \nfound that individuals were much more likely to tell self-serving lies in every media \nto individuals not well-known to them compared to those they felt close to. This, we \nbelieve, is because it is more risky and difficult to get away with telling a self-serving \nlie to individuals who are close to us. Individuals close to us have more information \nabout us and our day-to-day lives. In line with Goffman\u2019s (1959) theory, if one is \ncaught out by a self-serving lie, they are not only going to be judged negatively for the \nlie they told, but their entire character could be brought into question. There can be a \nmore at stake here that just the being caught out for telling a lie. \nWould I lie 15 \n We also found, as predicted, that individuals are more likely to tell other-\noriented lies to people close to them than to people not close to them. Moreover, when \nwe compared the types of lies individuals were more likely to tell someone close to \nthem, we found that individuals were much more likely to tell other-oriented lies than \nself-serving lies. Other-oriented lies are typically told to protect the feelings of the \nrecipient of the lie. Given this, one might feel more compelled to lie to a person close \nto them to protect their feelings rather than saying the truth, which could possibly \ncause them upset or distress. We are perhaps less motivated or concerned to protect \nthe feelings of individuals less close to us. Interestingly enough though, it appeared \nthat overall individuals were more likely to tell an other-oriented lie than a self-\nserving lie. Only in email to individuals not well-known to the person were \nparticipants more likely to tell a self-serving lie. Such a result questions much of the \npsychological literature which has tried to associate negative personality \ncharacteristics with those who are more likely to lie (e.g., Vrij, 2005), given that \nother-oriented lies could be constructed as an act of kindness and perhaps not an \nimmoral act. \n In addition to testing out our hypotheses we intended to examine whether \nHancock\u2019s et al.\u2019s (2004) \u2018Feature Based\u2019 theory would be supported when the type of \nlie as well as the recipient of the lie is taken into account. Unfortunately, as shown in \nTable 5, in each instance it was not supported by our data. \nTable 5 \nResults from this Study compared to Theories on Lying \nType of Lie \nRecipient \nFtF Phone Email \nSelf-serving 3 2 1 \nWould I lie 16 \nClose \nSelf-serving \nNot well-known \n3 2 1 \nOther-oriented \nClose \n1 1 1 \nOther-oriented \nNot well-known \n1 1 2 \nLying Predictions    \nFeature Based 2 1 3 \nMedia Richness 1 2 3 \nSocial Distance 3 2 1 \n(1 = highest amount of lying, 3 = the least) \n \n \nFor self-serving lies told to both people close to the participants as well as not \nwell-known, individuals stated they were more likely to tell a lie in email, followed by \nphone, and lastly face-to-face. This result supports the \u2018Social Distance\u2019 theory. To \nreiterate, \u2018Social Distance\u2019 theory suggests that individuals are more likely to lie in \nmedia where there is maximum space between the recipient and themselves. Theorists \nthat champion this theory argue that this is because lying makes people feel \nuncomfortable and that having distance between the liar and the recipient makes the \nliar more at ease with executing the lie. Self-serving lies are arguably more likely to \nmake the liar feel uncomfortable and apprehensive and so email is not surprisingly the \nideal place to tell such as lie. Email has the extra bonus of being an asynchronous \nform of media, which gives an individual time to think about how they will best tell \nWould I lie 17 \ntheir lie. Phone provides the distance and eliminates some of the non-verbal cues \nwhich might give away the lie (Vrij, Edward, Roberts, & Bull, 2000). \nThe results for which type of media individuals would be more likely to tell an \nother-oriented lie were not so clear cut. Participants believed they would be just as \nlikely to tell an other-oriented to someone close to them in any type of media. Perhaps \nthis is because the purpose of this type of lie is to maintain the integrity of the \nrecipient and one ought to be motivated to do this for someone they cared about in \nany type of media. Arguably, although one does not necessarily want to be caught out \nfor this type of lie, one would feel less anxious about telling a lie of this kind in \ncomparison to a self-serving lie. \nWhen it came to telling an other-oriented lie to individuals not well-known, \nthe participants claimed they would be less likely to say such a lie via email. This is \nan interesting twist. Such a result suggests that individuals would be more likely to \ntell people not well-known to them a truth via email that could potentially hurt their \nfeelings. Researchers have found that individuals can be more uninhibited and \naggressive online (e.g., Sproull & Kiesler, 1986). Ample evidence has been found for \nflaming online, which is aggressive and insulting talk (Whitty & Carr, 2006). It is \nargued that people are more likely to talk aggressively in CMC (computer mediated \ncommunication) than face-to-face because online there is a lack of social presence and \nless contextual cues. This is perhaps why this current study found that individuals \nwere more likely to say a hurtful truth than an other-oriented lie to individuals not \nwell-known to them in email. The social distance, in this particular case, motivates the \nperson to tell unpleasant truths. \nWe need to consider why Hancock et al.\u2019s (2004) \u2018Feature Based\u2019 theory was \nnot supported in this study. This study revealed that distance plays a more important \nWould I lie 18 \nrole than Hancock and his colleagues surmised. In developing a model that predicts \nlying behaviour, at least for self-serving lies, it would seem that distance ought to be \ngiven more weight than other features, such as whether the media are recordable or \nnot. The \u2018Features Based\u2019 model also contends that individuals are more likely to lie \nin synchronous communication, the argument being that lying is a more spontaneous \nactivity and so one is given greater opportunity to tell a lie in synchronous media. \nHowever, this current study found that if given the opportunity individuals would be \nmore likely to tell self-serving lies in asynchronous communication. Asynchronous \ncommunication and distance also play an important role in predicting whether people \nare more likely to reveal unpleasant truths to others they do not know well. \nThere are some obvious limitations to this study that are worthwhile \nhighlighting. This study considered hypothetical instances of lying and only one \nexample of the two types of lies under investigation. Therefore, it is difficult to \nascertain whether the participants in this study would actually behave in the way they \nbelieve they would typically behave. At the same time, diary studies also have their \nlimitations \u2013 getting participants to keep accurate tabs of lies and expecting them to \nrecall each instance of lying can be an arduous task. In saying that, it is important to \ncarry out studies to see if the results revealed in this current study are supported when \nwe measure individuals\u2019 actual behaviours. Additionally, this current study consisted \nof a university population, which makes it difficult to generalise these results to a non-\neducated population. Future research should consider other populations to test the \nclaims made in this paper. Finally, we considered only two types of lies, self-serving \nand other-oriented lies, there might be other types of lies we could have considered. \nIn concluding, this study highlights that when investigating the type of media \nindividuals are more likely to lie we must take into account the type of lie individuals \nWould I lie 19 \ntell as well as the recipient of the lie. This study found that individuals are much more \nlikely to tell self-serving lies to individuals not close to them and other-oriented lies to \nthose that are considered close. The potential impact of a lie probably determines \nwhether one is motivated to tell a lie. This study did reveal that the type of media one \nis communicating in does partly determine if one is likely to tell a lie. For self-serving \nlies, participants preferred the safe distance of email. Participants felt motivated to tell \nan other-oriented lie to people they felt close to across any type of media. However, \nwhen it came to telling harsh truths to people not so well-known participants preferred \nemail.  \n \nWould I lie 20 \nReferences \nBirchmeier, Z., Joinson, A. N., & Dietz-Uhler, B.
