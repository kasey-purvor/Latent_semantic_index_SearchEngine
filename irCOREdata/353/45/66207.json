This article extends a\nformal model of cascading organizational change by\nexamining the implications for organizational change of\nthe limited foresight of those who initiate such change\nabout unit interconnections (structural opacity) and the\nnormative restrictiveness imposed on architectural fea-\ntures by organizational culture (cultural asperity). Opacity\nleads actors to underestimate the lengths of periods of\nreorganization and the associated costs of change, there-\nby prompting them unwittingly to undertake changes\nwith adverse consequences. Increased opacity and asper-\nity lengthen the total time that the organization spends\nreorganizing and the associated opportunity costs; and\nthe expected effect of an architectural change on mortali-\nty hazards increases with the intricacy of the organiza-\ntional design, structural opacity, and the asperity of orga-\nnizational culture. We illustrate the theory with an\ninterpretation of the 1995 collapse of Baring Brothers\nBank.\u2022\nUnderstanding organizational change, particularly in internal\nstructures, remains a core issue in organizational theory, with\nall contemporary theoretical perspectives offering insights\nand arguments. Most recently, Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll\n(2003a) have developed a theory of change in organizational\narchitecture, depicted as a code system, that represents\nchange as a cascading process: an initial architectural change\ninduces other changes in the organization, generating a cas-\ncade of changes. The main theoretical argument ties two\norganizational properties to the total time that the organiza-\ntion spends reorganizing and to the associated opportunity\ncosts. Specifically, the expected deleterious effect of a\nchange in an organization\u2019s architecture on its mortality haz-\nard increases with intricacy (interconnectedness among units\nof the organizational design) and viscosity (sluggishness of\nresponse). But the expected effects of an architectural\nchange might be complicated by other factors.\nA key question about architectural change concerns the\nimpetus for an initiating change event: Why would any orga-\nnization undertake a change that was likely to take a long\ntime to complete and thereby cause it to miss many opportu-\nnities and risk failure? A common answer in organizational\ntheory is that such outcomes are unanticipated because\nbounded rationality leads decision makers to miscalculate the\ncosts and risks relative to the expected gains (March and\nSimon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963). This is a sound expla-\nnation, but there are several specific ways that bounded\nrationality might manifest itself in initiating architectural\nchange that looks good and might produce a positive out-\ncome yet can also generate potentially dire results. Two spe-\ncific factors that might affect the consequences of architec-\ntural change are (1) structural limits on foresight of those\ninitiating a change and (2) cultural opposition to the architec-\ntural change.\nLimited foresight produces a systematic tendency to under-\nestimate the length of reorganization periods and thus to\nunderestimate the costs of change. Given such systematic\n\u00a9 2003 by Johnson Graduate School,\nCornell University.\n0001-8392\/03\/48-03-0399\/$3.00.\n\u2022\nThis research was supported by fellow-\nships from the Netherlands Institute for\nAdvanced Study, the Stanford Graduate\nSchool of Business Trust, ERIM at Eras-\nmus University, and the Centre for Formal\nStudies in the Social Sciences at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\nUniversity.

Carroll\nStanford University\nunderestimation, organizational leaders can easily choose to\nenter into changes that cost far more than the expected ben-\nefits of successfully completing the change. For example,\nanalysts generally agree that in 1999 the management of\nXerox Corporation underestimated the difficulty of a transfor-\nmation it undertook in an attempt to improve its cost struc-\nture and provide better service. At a time when the company\nwas doing very well by most observable measures\u2014increas-\ning profits, high stock price, and no high-end competitors\nwith comparable products\u2014Xerox Corporation simultaneous-\nly reorganized the architectures of its sales and billing func-\ntions. The billing reorganization consolidated 36 administra-\ntive centers into three. The sales reorganization shifted its\nstaff of 15,000 persons from units based on geography to\nthose based on industry, transforming positions from local\ngeneralists to national product specialists. The results proved\ndisastrous: billing errors proliferated, and sales staff spent\nmuch of their time resolving problems rather than learning\ntheir new roles and making contacts with buyers that they\nhad never met. Staff turnover rose, sales dropped, and cus-\ntomers moved to competitors. At the same time, Xerox\nfaced stiff new competition on its previously unrivaled high-\nend copiers from both Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG and\nCanon Inc. Within 18 months the losses had become so sub-\nstantial that a recently installed chief executive officer (CEO)\nwas ousted, and the business press speculated that the com-\npany would not survive. As the Wall Street Journal noted,\n\u201cretraining to sell and service such intricate machines proved\nmore difficult than the company anticipated\u201d (Pereira and\nKlein, 2000: A3).\nCultural opposition might affect cascades of architectural\nchange because it signifies a shift in the meaning of a pro-\nposed architectural change, turning what was likely viewed\ninitially as a dispassionate cost-benefit calculation into a nor-\nmative matter. In Selznick\u2019s (1948) words, these architectural\nfeatures have become infused with moral value. The strength\nof cultural opposition can be difficult to anticipate, and the\nturmoil associated with it lengthens the reorganization period.\nFor example, at Apple Computer in 1997, CEO Gilbert Amelio\nintroduced a centralized architecture to a culture that \u201calways\nchampioned the individual and stressed freedom to act unilat-\nerally\u201d (Amelio, 1998: 228). Amid much strife, Apple\u2019s trans-\nformation continued down a stormy path until Amelio was\nousted and replaced by the founder, Steve Jobs.\nIn examining limited foresight and cultural opposition, we\nextend Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll\u2019s (2003a) model of cascad-\ning organizational change to include these ideas. Specifically,\nwe introduce and develop two concepts: opacity, defined as\nlimited foresight about interconnections among an organiza-\ntion\u2019s units, and asperity, defined as normative restrictions on\ncertain architectural features. Opacity leads actors to under-\nestimate the length of reorganization and the associated\ncosts of change, thereby prompting them to undertake\nchanges with adverse consequences. Both opacity and\nasperity increase the time spent reorganizing and raise the\nopportunity costs of change and the expected effect of archi-\ntectural change on mortality. To make connections with other\n400\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ntheoretical developments clear, we build formal representa-\ntions of the theoretical arguments, using a formal structure\nthat eases integration of the various strands of theory on\nstructural inertia and change: the nonmonotonic logic devel-\noped by P\u00f3los and Hannan (2001, 2002, 2004). We illustrate\nthe concepts and arguments by reinterpreting the circum-\nstances surrounding the spectacular collapse of Barings Bank\nin 1995, which involved both limited foresight and cultural\nopposition, in our interpretation.\nORGANIZATIONAL ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURE\nOrganizational analysts commonly distinguish between for-\nmal architectural and informal cultural features. Architecture\nrefers to the formal (official) specifications of an organization\nand its governance. Architectural choices are reflected in the\nformal structures for assigning work, that is, constructing the\nunits that undertake the subtransactions. The choices also\nspecify the means of coordinating members and units, moni-\ntoring them, and allocating resources and rewards. Culture\ngoverns how work actually gets completed, how members\ninteract, how decisions are actually made, which units defer\nto others, and so forth. The notion of culture includes both\ntacit knowledge of the details of the work process, including\nlocally generated knowledge and craft\/professional knowl-\nedge generated outside the organization, and norms encod-\ning the informal understandings and practices for interaction,\nauthority, and so forth. When viewed abstractly, specific\narchitectural and cultural elements can be regarded as the\nvalues of functions that specify organizational features. As\nSimon (1954) explained in analyzing the employment relation,\nthe values of such feature values are not defined with\nabsolute clarity; rather, they allow a certain amount of toler-\nance. Simon postulated that the employment relation is such\nthat the employee allows the employer to assign tasks from\nsome restricted range of options. We posit that architectures\nand cultures discriminate between the allowed and disal-\nlowed feature values, thereby imposing constraints on fea-\nture values and limiting the values that they can legitimately\ntake.\nAn appropriate language for expressing architectures and cul-\ntures should reflect these considerations. Moreover, it should\nallow precise judgments about the consistency of architec-\ntures and cultures. We use a semantic formulation, repre-\nsenting architectures and cultures as collections of sentences\npertaining to ontology (e.g., definitions of the units in an\narchitecture) and rules (e.g., statements of which units have\nauthority over which other units). Such sentences form a\ncode, which can be understood as both (1) a specification of\na blueprint, as in the genetic code, and (2) a rule of conduct,\nas in the penal code (P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll, 2002). Our\nuse of the term code reflects both meanings.\nSome codes matter greatly in the sense that violations are\npunished very severely while others are handled with a\nlighter touch, as with the distinction between felonies and\nmisdemeanors. Modeling the severity of codes poses numer-\nous challenges, and we do not attempt it here. Instead, we\nrestrict the theory to apply to serious codes. Henceforth,\n401\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nwhen we refer to architectural and cultural codes, we mean\nonly the serious ones, those whose observable violation\nbrings strong punishments.\nTo represent organizational architectural and cultural codes\nformally, we start by introducing some primitive terms. First,\nnot all kinds of organizations can be compared straightfor-\nwardly. Comparisons of organizations make the most sense\nwhen restricted to populations of organizations (Carroll and\nHannan, 2000). We link the arguments to populations by\nusing the two-place predicate O(o,p) that reads as \u201co is an\norganization in organizational population p.\u201d We intend that\nthe theory be understood as applying to all populations of\norganizations, and we do not know of any exceptions. If we\ndid know of such exceptional cases, we would express the\nentire theory as holding as a rule with exceptions, and we\nwould employ nonmonotonic quantification over populations.\nIn terms of the formalisms of the theory-building strategy,\nthis would work as follows. Suppose that \u03d5(p) is a postulate\nof the theory. Then, the theoretical claim formulated in a way\nthat allows for accidental exceptions would be stated as\n\u0001p[\u03d5(p)]. (We explain the quantifier \u0001 below.) We do not\nintroduce this level of complication in our formal rendering of\nthe theory.\nOur argument will specify some basic processes at the level\nof the organization unit. The predicate U(u,o) says that \u201cu is a\nunit of the entity o, where O(o,p).\u201d We add the background\nassumption that units belong to only one organization. In for-\nmal terms,\n\u2200o,o\u2032,u [U(u,o) \u2227 U(u,o\u2032 ) \u2192 (o = o\u2032 )].\nTables 1 and 2 summarize our notation.\nAn organizational architecture can be regarded as a set of val-\nues of features, such as the form of authority, pattern of con-\ntrol relations, accounting principles, compensation policies,\nand so forth. Some relevant features that pertain to its global\narchitecture are common to units in an organization; others\nvary by type of unit. We describe the architecture of a unit by\nidentifying the relevant features and determining the set of\nfeasible alternative values of each feature. For instance, the\nform of authority might be a relevant feature; and the rele-\nvant alternatives might be \u201cbureaucratic,\u201d \u201cprofessional,\u201d\nand \u201ccharismatic.\u201d In other words, we consider features to\nbe functions that map from organizations and time points to\nthe range of possible values. We denote the kth feature of\nunit u at time t as \u0192k(u,t), and we denote the range of possi-\nble values by (the set) Ak(u,t). The Cartesian product of the\nsets of possible values taken over all of the relevant features:\nAut \u0001 A1ut \u00d7 A2ut \u00d7 \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u00d7 AKut gives the space of potential archi-\ntectures for the unit. Finally, we let aut denote the unit\u2019s actu-\nal architecture, the set of choices of values for each of the\nrelevant features. When we want to instantiate formally that\naut is a unit\u2019s actual architecture, we use the predicate\nARCH(u,t,aut), which reads as \u201caut is the K-tuple of feature\nvalues that specifies unit u\u2019s architecture at time t.\u201d\n402\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\n403\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nTable 1\nNotation for Logical Constants, Predicates, Functions, and Relations\nLogical constants\n\u2228 Disjunction\n\u2227 Conjunction\n\u00ac Negation\n\u2203 Classical existential quantifier\n\u2200 Classical universal quantifier\n\u2192 Classical material implication\n\u0001 Nonmonotonic \u201cnormally\u201d quantifier\n\u0002 Nonmonotonic \u201cauxiliary\u201d quantifier\n\u0003 Nonmonotonic \u201cpresumably\u201d quantifier\nARCH(u,t,\u03b1) Unit u\u2019s architecture at t is given by the codes \u03b1\nCUL(u,t,\u03b3) Unit u\u2019s culture at t is given by the codes \u03b3\nO(o,p) o is an organization in population p\nOP(u,u\u2032) Unit u\u2032 is opaque to unit u\nRE(u,t) Unit u is in reorganization at time t\nU(u,o) Unit u is a unit in organization o\nFunctions\nAo Asperity of organization o\nc(u) Centrality of unit u\nIo Intricacy of organization o\nI*o Foreseen intricacy of organization o\nPo Opacity of organization o\nRelations\n\u0001 Dominance relation over units\nTable 2\nNotation for Random Variables, Probabilities, and Key Parameters\nRandom variables\nd(u,t) Duration of an induced violation in unit u\nD(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) Sum of the durations of the induced violations in a cascade \ninitiated by unit u at time t\nD(o,t) Sum of the durations of the induced violations in a cascade \ninitiated by a random unit at time t\n\u03b4(u,t) = 1 Unit u initiates an architectural code change just before t (=\n0 otherwise)\n\u2206(o,t) = 1 Organization o experiences an architectural code change \njust before t (= 0 otherwise)\nm(u,w,w\u2032 ) Number of opportunities missed by unit u during [w,w\u2032)\nM(u,w,w\u2032 ) Number of opportunities missed by organization o during\n[w,w\u2032)\n\u0002(o,t) Organization o\u2019s hazard of mortality at t\nN(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) Number of units with induced violations in a cascade initiat-\ned by unit u at time t\nN(o,t) Number of units with induced violations in a cascade initiat-\ned by a random unit at time t\nR(o,t) Organization o\u2019s stock of resources at time t\nS(o,t) Temporal span of a cascade in organization o starting at t\nv(u,u\u2032,t) = 1 Unit u induces an architectural code violation in unit u\u2032 at t\n(= 0 otherwise)\n\u03bbo Hazard of initiating architectural change for units in o\n\u0003o Probability of induced arch. code violation for units in o\nPopulation-specific parameters\n\u03b7o Probability that a unit misses an opportunity while not in \nreorganization\n\u03b7\u223c o Probability that a unit misses an opportunity while in reorga-\nnization\n\u03beo Arrival rate of opportunities for a unit in organization o\n\u039eo Arrival rate of opportunities for organization o\nArchitectural codes restrict the set of allowable architectures.\nA sharp architectural code rules out many of the possibilities\nin Aut; a loose architecture places few constraints on the\narchitectural choices of the unit. It is important to distinguish\narchitectural codes that lie under the control of the unit from\nthose imposed externally. Let \u03b1ut \u0001 Aut denote the set that\ncontains the officially approved architectures for unit u at\ntime t, and let \u03b1iut and \u03b1\ne\nut be the internally and externally con-\ntrolled subcodes, respectively. (For simplicity, we assume\nthat the two subcodes are disjoint: \u03b1ut = \u03b1\ni\nut \u222a \u03b1\ne\nut.) The\nimposed codes reflect a superordination relation among\nunits; they could arise from specified lines of authority, from\nthe flow of work, or from any similar relation that allows one\npart of the organization to impose constraints on another\npart. An important class of interunit relations concerns subor-\ndination in choice of architecture. Let u \u0001 u\u2032 specify that unit\n\u201cu and u\u2032 are units in the same organization and u is super-\nordinate to unit u\u2032 in the sense that choices of architectural\nfeature values by u create architectural code restrictions\n(binding constraints) for unit u\u2032.\u201d\nCulture\nCultural codes are typically implicit and local and govern the\ninformal organization. They specify how things actually get\ndone, how people interact, the bases of status, and so forth.\nArchitectural and cultural codes generally differ with respect\nto enforcement. An agent in authority typically uses organiza-\ntional authority to compel compliance with the rule. This\nmeans using organizational sanctions such as official repri-\nmands, threats of demotion or budget cuts, and so forth. The\nenforcement mechanism for cultural codes works by more\nsubtle means. Both insiders and outsiders hold expectations\nof the organization based on cultural codes, and they devalue\norganizations that violate applicable cultural codes. Cultural-\ncode violations are often prevented simply by the threat of\ndevaluation. Furthermore, persistent perceived code viola-\ntions, in turn, produce a sequence of drops in valuations (for\ndetails on these processes, see P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll,\n2002). Of course, the literature on organizations contains\nmany stories and ideas about how organizations manage to\ncontinue to operate while experiencing code violations.\nExternally enforced cultural codes reflect some kind of broad\nexternal constraint, such as codes and norms of professional\nconduct, regulations, and laws. Internally enforced codes\nconstitute the local culture\u2014traditions and stable expecta-\ntions about various aspects of life within an organization. In\nthis article, we restrict our attention to those aspects of the\nculture that bear directly on architectural choices. We\nassume that local culture generally sets range restrictions on\narchitectures, producing strong resistance should violation be\nattempted. For example, when officials at Ben & Jerry\u2019s Ice\nCream proposed to relax the rule that set a ceiling on the\nratio of the highest to the lowest level of compensation in\nthe firm, a strong cultural reaction opposed this architectural\nchange (Lager, 1994). Similarly, the faculty cultures of most\ntop research-oriented business schools are likely to strenu-\nously resist attempts by a dean (say, a former chief executive\n404\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nofficer) to impose command-and-control decision making for\nfaculty personnel decisions.\nWe define the architecturally relevant local cultural code, \u03b3ut,\nas the subset of Aut that is not forbidden by the cultural code\nof the unit. When we want to instantiate formally that \u03b3ut is\n(part of) a unit\u2019s cultural code, we use the predicate\nCUL(u,t,\u03b3ut), which says that \u201c\u03b3ut \u0001 Aut is the set of architec-\ntures that satisfy unit u\u2019s cultural code at time t.\u201d\nA restrictive culture excludes many architectural possibilities.\nWe call the level of such cultural restrictiveness asperity,\nrelying on the dictionary definition of asperity as \u201cseverity or\nrigor,\u201d which determines the normative restrictiveness on\ncertain architectural features. In formal terms, we represent\nasperity as follows.\nDefinition 1 (D.1). The asperity of a unit\u2019s architecturally rele-\nvant culture equals the fraction of possible architectures that\nthe culture rules out.\nAssume ARCH(u,t,\u03b1ut) \u2227 CUL(u,t,\u03b3ut).\na(u,t) = 1 \u2013\n|\u03b3ut|\n|\u03b1ut|\n, |\u03b1ut| > 0,\nwhere |.| denotes the cardinality of a set, the number of\nunique elements it contains. Note that this measure of asper-\nity equals one if the culture does not admit any of the official-\nly warranted architectures; it equals zero if the culture does\nnot rule out any of the approved architectures.\nTHEORY STAGE 1: INTRICACY AND RANDOM\nCASCADES\nWe build on the model of random cascades developed by\nHannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll (2003a), which we call Theory\nStage 1 and briefly review here. This model concerns\nchanges in some architectural features and\/or codes by some\nparticular organizational unit, which might sit anywhere in the\norganization\u2019s formal hierarchy. The reasons for the initial\nchange are not pertinent to the theory; they could encom-\npass a wide variety of possibilities, including changes in\nexternal opportunities and constraints, executive tinkering,\nand internal strife. The specific change undertaken might be\nsensible in that it would likely improve organizational align-\nment and functioning, but we do not assume this\u2014changes\ncan also degrade performance. Our focus on architectural\nchanges as triggers of cascades reflects the view that archi-\ntecture is generally more malleable to management and to\nindividual decision makers: changing the architecture often\nrequires only a directive to do so from someone with\nauthority.\nLet the random variable \u03b4(u,t) equal one if unit u changes its\narchitecture by replacing an architectural code or a feature\nvalue just after t; and it equals zero otherwise. When the ref-\nerence is to an organization, rather than a unit, undergoing\narchitectural change, the random variable \u2206(o,t) is used; it\nequals one if any unit in organization o experiences architec-\n405\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ntural change at (just after) time t, and it equals zero other-\nwise.\n\u2206(o,t) = 1 \u2194 \u2203u[O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 \u03b4(u,t) = 1)].\nInconsistencies between new and existing codes normally\nbecome salient and consequential when actions that would\nhave satisfied the old architectural code do not satisfy the\nnew one. We represent this formally by defining violations of\na unit\u2019s architectural code that are induced by another unit.\nThe random variable v(u,u\u2032,t) equals one if unit u\u2032 induces an\narchitectural code violation for unit u at time t and equals\nzero otherwise. Once a unit experiences an induced violation,\nthe violation persists until it adjusts its architecture to con-\nform to the newly imposed constraints, though we do not\nassume that all violations get fixed; the duration might be\nvery long. We denote the time that passes between the\ninduction and the elimination of an architectural code viola-\ntion, the duration of the induced violation, with the random\nvariable d(u,t). A key step in building the model is defining a\ncascade of induced changes initiated by an original (unin-\nduced) change in architecture by a unit in the organization.\nDefinition 2 (D.2). A particular cascade of resolutions of\ninduced architectural-code violations in organization o that\nbegins at time t with a change initiated by unit u is construct-\ned as follows:\nStep 0. The unit u, not in violation of any of its applicable architec-\ntural code, initiates the cascade at time t by changing its architectur-\nal code, and that change induces architectural-code violations in one\nor more other units;\nStep 1. A unit with an induced violation in step 0 changes its archi-\ntecture such that conformity eliminates the induced violation, but\nthis architectural change induces a violation in one or more other\nunits;\n*\nStep L. The only unit with an unresolved induced violation (generat-\ned by the previous steps in the cascade) eliminates the violation at\ntime tL, and this architectural change does not induce a violation in\nany unit.\nWe denote the set of induced changes such a cascade com-\nprises as K(u,t), where the variables identify the unit that initi-\nated the cascade (u) and the time of initiation (t).\nWe pay special attention to the temporal dimensions of a ran-\ndom cascade in formulating substantive ideas such as those\npertaining to cultural resistance. We see two different ways\nto think about the longevity of such cascades. One is to con-\nsider the temporal span, S(o,t), the time elapsed from the ini-\ntiating event to the elimination event that terminates the cas-\ncade. The other is to examine the total amount of time spent\nby units in reorganization, changing codes and feature values\nso as to eliminate induced violations. The total time in reorga-\nnization during a cascade, D(o,t), is calculated by summing up\nthe times taken in all the individual stages of the cascade,\n406\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\neven if they occur simultaneously. Both concepts have sub-\nstantive promise, because a protracted period of reorganiza-\ntion presumably complicates organizational action and diverts\nthe attention of at least some members over the whole peri-\nod\u2014the first idea\u2014and because the disruption caused by\nreorganization ought to be proportional to the time spent by\nunits (and their members) in working out the consequences\nof changes\u2014the second idea. Because we model changes at\nthe unit level, it will simplify the analysis to concentrate on\ntotal reorganization time.\nThe Probability Model for Random Cascades (\u220f)\nThe first stage of the theory represents expected outcomes\nin cascades initiated by a unit chosen at random. The treat-\nment of cascades with random initiators is crucial for repre-\nsenting the kinds of comparisons made in empirical research\non the consequences of structural change, which rarely has\naccess to the full history of all of the cascades of change. As\nwe explain in the Appendix, we refer to the simplifying\nassumptions that we expect to see relaxed in further devel-\nopments of the theory as auxiliary assumptions, and we refer\nto the real causal claims of the theory as postulates. In this\nanalysis, the auxiliary assumptions concern the probabilistic\nstructure of the change process. We quantify auxiliary\nassumptions using the \u0002 quantifier discussed in the Appen-\ndix. The probability model used for this purpose, which we\ndenote by \u220f, makes the following auxiliary assumptions:\n1. The probability that a change in a unit induces a violation in\na subordinate unit, Pr{v(u,u\u2032,t)}, does not vary between\npairs of units or over time; it is an organization-specific\nconstant, \u0003o.\n2. The expected time to elimination of an induced violation of\narchitectural code does not vary over units or over time; it\nis an organization-specific constant: \u03c4o, which gives the\norganization\u2019s viscosity or sluggishness in response.\n3. The hazard of initiating an architectural change does not\nvary over units or over time; it is an organization-specific\nconstant: \u03bbo > 0.\n4. The arrival rate of opportunities for the organizations in a\npopulation varies over time but does not vary over units at\na point in time: \u039e > 0; the arrival rate for a unit in an orga-\nnization is \u039e \/ Uo, where Uo equals the number of units in\norganization o.\n5. The probability that a unit misses an opportunity while in\nreorganization and the probability of missing an opportuni-\nty in the absence of a reorganization does not vary over\ntime or among units in the organizations in a population;\nthey are population parameters, \u03b7 + \u03b7\u223c and \u03b7, respectively\n(\u03b7,\u03b7\u223c > 0).\nTwo units are connected in an architectural sense if the fea-\nture values of one govern and constrain the architectural\ncodes of the other. In particular, one unit constrains another\narchitecturally if the feature values and choices allowed by\nthe codes of the former are imposed as an external con-\nstraint (as codes) on the latter. Let Uo give the number of\n407\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nunits in an organization. Consider a Uo\u00d7Uo adjacency matrix R\nfor which rij = 1 if unit i constrains unit j architecturally and\nequals 0 otherwise, that is, if ui \u0001 uj. Furthermore, let c(u) be\na function that gives the architectural centrality of unit u. The\nvector of centrality scores of the units of organization o at\ntime t is given by a slight variation on Bonacich\u2019s (1987) mea-\nsure of centrality:\nc =\n\u221e\n\u03a3\nk=1\n(\u0003o)\nk Rk l,\nwhere l is a (N\u00d71) vector of ones.\nLet N(u,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) be a random variable that records the\nnumber of induced violations in the cascade \u2329u\u2032,t\u2032\u232a \u2208 K(u,t).\nUnder the probability model \u220f, the architectural centrality of\nthe unit that initiates a cascade gives the expected number\nof induced violations in the cascade. This is the key to the\nmodel. In expressing this result formally, we use the follow-\ning notation to denote the operation of mathematical expec-\ntation: E{\u22c5}. We also introduce a shorthand expression for the\nsum of the durations of all reorganizations triggered by the\ncascade K(u,t):\nD(u,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) \u0001 \u03a3 \u2329u\u2032,t\u2032\u232a\u2208K(u,t)d(u\u2032,t\u2032).\nLemma 1 (L.1). The expected number of induced violations\nresulting from an architectural change by a unit equals its\ncentrality in the architecture, c(u) (L.1 in Hannan, P\u00f3los, and\nCarroll, 2003a):\n\u0003o,u,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2192 E{N(o,t | \u03b4(u,t)) = 1)} = c(u)].\nThis formula says that a minimal rule chain in this stage of\nthe theory supports the claim that the expected number of\ninduced violations in a cascade with random origin equals the\ncentrality of the initiating unit (the proof is given in Hannan,\nP\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2003a). It should be noted that the gener-\nalizations pertain to properties of probability distributions. An\nexception to these generalizations would be a population for\nwhich the probability distribution deviates from the normal\npattern, not stochastic variation within a population governed\nby a particular distribution.\nThe next step in representing random cascades allows the\norigin (the unit initiating the cascade) to be chosen at random\nso that changes can be compared across organizations in a\npopulation. The mean centrality score in an organization pro-\nvides a useful way to express intuitions about likely lengths\nof such random cascades. For a unit to have a high centrality\nscore, it must dominate units that are themselves high in\ncentrality. Therefore, cascades are more likely to hit units\nwith high centralization in an organization with a high mean\ncentrality. Mean centrality provides a way to characterize the\nintricacy of the organization\u2019s design; The Oxford English Dic-\n408\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ntionary defines intricate as \u201cperplexingly entangled or\ninvolved; interwinding in a complicated manner.\u201d Let Io\ndenote a non-negative function that records the intricacy of\nthe design of organization o.\nDefinition 3 (D.3). The intricacy of an organization\u2019s design\nequals the mean of the centralities of its subunits:\nIo \u0001 (1\/Uo)\nUo\n\u03a3\nu=1\nc(u).\nAnalyses of cascades with a random initiating unit involve cal-\nculating expectations of functions of random cascades.\nThese functions involve summations over all of the induced\nviolations in a cascade. In the standard case, in which the\nsize of the set of elements in the summation is deterministic,\nthe straightforward calculation uses the rule that the expecta-\ntion of a sum of functions of random variables is the sum of\nthe expectations. In the case of cascades, the number of ele-\nments in the summation is itself a random variable, N(o,t |\n\u03b4(u,t) = 1) if the cascade initiates in unit u as we noted\nabove. Recall also, according to L.1, that E{N(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1)}\n= c(u).\nNow consider the case of an initiating unit chosen at random,\nas specified in the auxiliary assumptions. Let the number of\ninduced violations in a cascade with random origin be denot-\ned N(o,t), the time spent reorganizing in a random case as\nD(o,t), and the temporal span of a cascade, the time elapsed\nfrom origin to conclusion, by S(o,t); the absence of the condi-\ntion that identifies the unit initiating the cascade distinguish-\nes these random variables from those introduced earlier.\nLemma 2 (L.2). The expected number of induced violations\nwithin a cascade with a random origin equals the organiza-\ntion\u2019s intricacy (L.2 in Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2003a):\n\u0003o,u,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 (\u2206(o,t) = 1) \u2192 E{N(o,t)} = Io].\nThe rest of Stage 1 of the theory derives implications of cas-\ncades for an organization\u2019s life chances using arguments\nabout the effect of reorganization on the probability of miss-\ning opportunities and the effect of missing opportunities on\nthe growth or decline in resources. It generates a predicted\nrise in mortality hazards for organizations with high levels of\nintricacy because of the opportunities they miss while reorga-\nnizing (an empirical pattern different from that assumed by\nBarnett and Carroll, 1995). We do not restate this part of the\ntheory here. Some of it is overridden by the more specific\narguments that we present below. The enduring part will be\nrestated as the flow of the argument demands.\nLIMITED FORESIGHT: STRUCTURAL OPACITY\nThe theory of Stage 1 provides a tool for analyzing organiza-\ntional change; it explains how certain architectural changes in\ncertain contexts might increase an organization\u2019s chances of\nfailure. But recognizing such possibilities raises the question\n409\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nof why any organization would initiate such a hazardous\nchange. We assume that managers are intendedly rational\nand well-meaning, that they are not intentionally destructive\nwhen they initiate such changes but, instead, believe they\nare making organizational adjustments that will improve per-\nformance and life chances. So the initial change must involve\na miscalculation that results in an unexpected outcome\n(Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993; Sterman, Repenning, and\nKofman, 1997).\nAlthough many possible forms of miscalculation could pro-\nduce this result, we focus on one that is only subtly connect-\ned to the outcome and that can be exploited in the model.\nWe concentrate on the opacity of some of the interconnec-\ntions among units in the organization and the limited fore-\nsight that results. In other words, we assume that reduced\nforesight about the exact structure of connections among\nunits impairs the ability to forecast accurately the costs and\nbenefits of a change. Such miscalculation can give the organi-\nzation a rosier-than-justified expectation and thus prompt it to\nundertake changes with deleterious results.\nWe distinguish what is foreseen when reorganization begins\nfrom what actually happens. We mark predicates and func-\ntions that refer to foresight with an asterisk; those that refer\nto the facts, as they emerge, are not so marked. Using our\nnotation for foresight, we define N*(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) as the ran-\ndom variable that records the number of induced violations of\nnew code resulting from a cascade initiated by unit u that can\nbe foreseen by the relevant actors in that unit at time t; and\nD*(u,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) as the random variable that records the\nforeseen length of the cascade from the vantage of unit u in\norganization o at time t.\nWe assume that actual periods of reorganization lengthen to\nthe extent that the number of induced violations exceeds the\nlimits on foresight. When violations cannot be foreseen,\nagents cannot plan comprehensively for reorganization and\ncannot undertake as many adjustments in parallel. The fact\nthat the unforeseen architectural code violations show up in\nmid-change slows the process of reorganization, thereby\nextending actual periods of reorganization.\nIn many cases, an organization\u2019s structure imposes limits on\nwhat can be known, with the result that information about\nsome parts of an organization is unavailable in other parts,\nwhat Williamson (1975) called information impactedness. For\ninstance, Stinchcombe (1990: 75) observed that local unit\ninformation usually does not \u201chave to flow anywhere in a\nhierarchy, except in very aggregated form as a budget esti-\nmate.\u201d Sometimes the languages used in different parts of\nthe organization differ such that those outside the unit cannot\ninterpret a full-disclosure description of the activities in an\norganizational unit. Other times, lack of transparency arises\ndue to strategic withholding of information.\nStinchcombe (1990: 81) noted that pools of local knowledge\nmight facilitate cultural developments that heighten opacity:\nWhen a large share of the information used in a given activity is\nsuch local knowledge, a subculture grows that is more or less isolat-\n410\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ned from the rest of the organization. The subculture is organized in a\nlarge measure around the information system that is of little use or\ninterest to anyone else and so is adapted to particular concrete fea-\ntures, . . . uses an arcane language or system of notation and\nresists invasion by standards from larger and more uniform informa-\ntion systems.\nAlthough opacity might have many potential meanings in an\norganizational context, we apply the idea here in a very spe-\ncific sense. Specifically, one unit is structurally opaque to\nanother, as we define the term, if the connections that flow\nfrom the former cannot be seen by the latter. To represent\nopacity in terms of the formal model used to analyze random\ncascades, we treat the matrix R, which records the superor-\ndination relations among the units of the organization, as fac-\ntual and compare it with the potentially clouded vision from\nthe vantage points of the various units. We use the predicate\nOP(u,u\u2032), which says as \u201cunit u's vision of unit u\u2032 is opaque in\nthe sense that u cannot see u\u2032\u2019s superordination relations.\u201d\nThen, we define the matrix R*u, the matrix of architectural\nrelations in the organization from u\u2019s (potentially opaque) van-\ntage point.\nDefinition 4 (D.4). R*u is the Uo\u00d7Uo matrix whose (i,j)th ele-\nment is given by\nr*u(i,j) = {1 if r(i,j ) = 1 \u2227 \u00acOP(u,ui);0 otherwise.\nNote that this definition imposes the constraint that the u\u2032th\nrow in R*u is set to zero if u\u2032 is opaque to u. This means that\nthe dominance relations of u\u2032 over other units are obscured.\nWe can see the consequences of opacity by considering the\ncentrality scores based on R*u.\nDefinition 5 (D.5). The partially obscured centrality of unit u\nat time t is given by\nc*(u) = b\n\u221e\n\u03a3\nk=1\n\u0003ko(R\n*\nu)\nk l,\nwhere b is an (1\u0004Uo) vector with bi = 0 for i \u2260 u and bi = 1\nfor i = u. (Note that premultiplying by b simply picks out the\nuth element in the vector of partial centrality scores from the\nvantage point of u.) We refer to the difference between the\nactual and partially obscured centralities of a unit as the opac-\nity of the structure from its perspective.\nDefinition 6 (D.6). The opacity of the structure for a unit is\nthe difference between the unit\u2019s actual and foreseen central-\nity scores:\np(u) = c(u) \u2013 c*(u).\nWith this definition in hand, we obtain a lemma paralleling\nL.1, which holds that the expected number of induced viola-\n411\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ntions in a cascade with known origin equals the centrality of\nthe initiating unit.\nLemma 3 (L.3). The expected number of induced violations\nin a cascade not foreseen from the vantage of the initiating\nunit equals the opacity of the initiator: p(u).\n\u0003o,u,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2192\nE{N(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) \u2013 N*(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1)} = p(u)].\nProof. In the nonmonotonic logic we use, establishing a\nproof involves constructing the most-specific regularity\nchains that connect the antecedent and the consequent. The\nregularity chains are constructed from the available defini-\ntions, postulates, strict rules, and auxiliary assumptions. If\nthe most-specific such regularity chain supports the claim,\nthen the theorem is proven. If among the most-specific regu-\nlarity chains, some support the claim and others support the\ncounter claim, then no conclusion is warranted\u2014the claim is\nnot a theorem. Therefore, we construct the most-specific\nregularity chains in sketching each proof.\nThe expected foreseen number of induced violations, E{N*(o,t |\n\u03b4(u,t) = 1)}, can be expressed as the sum of the expected\nforeseen number of violations at each path length. That is,\nE{N*(o,t | \u03b4(u,t) = 1)} = \u03a3\u221ek=1 E{N*k(u,t)}, where E{N*k(u,t)} is the\nexpected foreseen number of induced violations at step k of\nthe cascade (that is, at path length k). The joint probability of\nk inductions along a path, under \u220f is given by \u0003ko. Because\ninductions must follow the subordination relation, E{N*k(u,t)}\n= \u03a3u\u2260u\u2032\u0003ko z*ku,u\u2032, where z*ku,u\u2032 equals the number of distinct k-\nstep foreseen paths connecting u and u\u2032. Inspecting the\nterms in the powers of R* reveals that z*ku,u\u2032 is the (u,u\u2032) entry\nin (R*)k. Therefore, the expected foreseen number of induced\nviolations equals c*(u). By L.1, the expected actual number\nequals c(u). Use of D.6 completes the regularity chain.\nNext we define a function, Po, that defines opacity at the\norganizational level as the average of the opacities of its\nunits.\nDefinition 7 (D.7). An organization\u2019s opacity equals the differ-\nence between the actual intricacy and the partially obscured\nintricacy:\nPo = (1\/Uo)\nUo\n\u03a3\nu=1\np(u) = Io \u2013 I\n*\no,\nwhere I*o = (1\/Uo)\u03a3Uou=1c*(u).\nNote that Po = 0 if and only if the centralities are not\nobscured for any unit. We call this the case of full transparen-\ncy. Io = 0 logically implies that Po = 0, because I\n*\no = 0 in this\ncase.\n412\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nLemma 4 (L.4). The expected number of unforeseen induced\nviolations in a cascade initiated by a random unit equals the\norganization\u2019s opacity:\n\u0003o,t [O(o,p) \u2227 (\u2206(o,t) = 1) \u2192 E{N(o,t) \u2013 N*(o,t)} = Po].\nProof. By definition E{N(o,t ) \u2013 N*(o,t )} = E{N(o,t )} \u2013 E{N*(o,t )}.\nAccording to L.2, E{N*(o,t )} = Io. By the law of total probabi-\nlity,\nE{N*(o,t)} = \u03a3\nu\nE{N*(o,t) | \u03b4(u,t) = 1) Pr{\u03b4(u,t)}.\nAccording to the probability model \u220f, Pr{\u03b4(u,t)} = 1\/Uo. Then,\ngiven L.3 and D.7, we have\nE{N*(o,t)} = (1\/Uo) \u03a3\nu\nc*(u) = I*o.\nReference to D.7 completes the regularity chain that sup-\nports the theorem.\nWhen we relate opacity to the expected duration of a cas-\ncade, we will need an expression that specifies the probabili-\nty that an induced violation is foreseen. As with the assump-\ntions in the probability model \u220f, we want to simplify as much\nas possible. Therefore, we introduce an auxiliary assumption\nthat holds that each induced violation is equally likely to be\nforeseen and that this probability equals the fraction of fore-\nseen to total induced violations. Let v*u(u\u2032,t) be a random vari-\nable that equals one if the pair \u2329u\u2032,t\u2032\u232a is one of the induced\nviolations in the cascade K(u,t) and the occurrence of this\ninduced violation is foreseen from the vantage point of u, the\ninitiator of the cascade and that equals zero if it is not fore-\nseen.\nPostulate 1 (P.1). The expected duration of an unforeseen\nviolation normally exceeds that of a foreseen one:\n\u0001o,u,u\u2032,u\u2033,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 U(u\u2032,o) \u2227 U(u\u2033,o) \u2227 (\u03b4(u,t) = 1) \u2192\nE{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} < E{d(u\u2033,t\u2033 | v*u(u\u2033,t\u2033 ) = 0)}].\nFinally, we need to define the probability that an actual viola-\ntion is foreseen.\nAuxiliary Assumption 1 (A.1).

By cultural opposition,\nwe mean that the proposed architecture violates the cultural\ncode of the organization, causing normative reactions against\nthe change. These reactions could emanate from a variety of\nsources, including local tradition, professional norms, identity\nand form constraints, and national culture and social structure\n(Crozier, 1964). From our point of view, the important obser-\nvations are that (1) the strength of cultural opposition can be\ndifficult to anticipate, (2) normative opposition generates tur-\nmoil, and (3) turmoil likely lengthens the reorganization\nperiod.\nWe want to consider situations in which units experience\ninduced violations of architectural codes and take actions to\nmodify the local architecture to come into conformity with\nthe newly imposed external constraints. We do not attempt\nto specify exactly when the cultural code violation occurs,\nother than to assume that it occurs after the induced viola-\ntion of architectural code. We distinguish cases in which the\nlocal modifications of the architecture conform to the local\nculture from those in which it does not. Let the random vari-\nable y(u,t) equal one if unit u experiences cultural opposition\nduring an attempt to resolve an induced violation of architec-\ntural code at time t and equal zero otherwise. When such\nconflict occurs, the new architecture becomes morally sus-\npect in the eyes of a unit\u2019s members. We believe that this\nwas the case in the examples mentioned above: CEO Ame-\nlio\u2019s attempt to centralize Apple Computer and the top man-\nagement of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream\u2019s attempt to expand the\ninternal salary ratio. Note that there might be nothing opera-\ntionally wrong with the new code; the architectural change\nmight very well prove beneficial except for the cultural reac-\ntion.\nIn analyzing cultural opposition, we build on the concept of\nasperity, the fraction of officially allowed architectures that\nthe culture rules out. Because a rigorous culture rules out\nmany architectures, efforts to modify architecture more likely\nviolate cultural rules in organizations with greater asperity.\nWe formalize this idea as follows.\nPostulate 2 (P.2). The probability that an induced architectural\nchange will trigger cultural opposition to local architectural\nchange is proportional to the asperity of a unit\u2019s culture:\n\u0001o,u,u\u2032,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 (v(u,u\u2032,t ) = 1) \u2192 Pr{y(u,t )} = a(u,t )].\nCultural opposition resists ready resolution for at least three\nreasons. First, cultural violations often produce intense moral\nreactions that cause individuals and groups to fight harder\nand longer. Second, those outside a unit might not perceive\nthat the opposition is cultural because even cultural resis-\ntance often concentrates on technical matters. So resolution\nefforts might focus mistakenly on non-cultural issues per-\nceived to be the source of opposition. Third, organizational\n414\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nculture provides a potential basis for very broad resistance.\nThus the proponents of the changes cannot count on many\nmembers of the organization to use their specialized knowl-\nedge to facilitate the many local adjustments required to\ncomplete the change. Such changes require more direct\nmanagerial control. Given limits on managerial time and\neffort, reliance on managerial control puts sharp limits on the\npace of adjustment. Accordingly, we postulate that cultural\nresistance slows processes of change.\nPostulate 3 (P.3). It generally takes longer to eliminate an\ninduced violation of an architectural code if cultural codes get\nviolated:\n\u0001o,u,u\u2032,t,t\u2032 [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 U(u\u2032,o) \u2227 (y(u,t) = 1) \u2227 (y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2192\nE{d(u,t)} > E{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 )}].\nWe now want to aggregate to the organizational level under\nthe simplifying (auxiliary) assumption that organizations have\ncharacteristic levels of asperity that do not vary among units\nor over time. This assumption is clearly justified in at least\nsome cases by the extensive literature on organizational cul-\nture positing the existence of unitary cultural characteristics.\nAuxiliary Assumption 2 (A.2). Each organization has a char-\nacteristic (common) level of asperity that applies to all units:\n\u0001o\u2203Ao\u2200u,u\u2032,t,t\u2032 [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 U(u\u2032,o) \u2192 (a(u,t) = a(u\u2032,t\u2032 ) = Ao)].\nOPACITY, ASPERITY, AND THE DURATION OF\nREORGANIZATION\nWe now state explicit assumptions relating opacity and\nasperity to the time it takes for an induced architectural viola-\ntion in a unit to be resolved. Stage 1 of the theory used an\nauxiliary assumption that holds that the expected duration of\nan induced violation does not vary over units or over time for\nan organization. This common duration was labeled as \u03c4o and\ncalled viscosity (sluggishness). At this point, we take advan-\ntage of nonmonotonic logic to override the earlier assumption\nwith new ones that apply to situations of greater specificity.\nThe original assumption continues to hold and is not overrid-\nden if all that we know is that an organization belongs to a\ngiven population. If we know more than this, specifically, if\nwe have information about opacity and asperity, then the\noriginal default is replaced by the more-specific auxiliary\nassumption stated below.\nOur conceptual framework highlights four conditions: an\ninduced architectural violation for a unit can be either fore-\nseen or not, and it can either trigger cultural resistance to\nchange or not. One approach to modeling these conditions\nassumes that the effects of opacity and asperity are additive.\nThen we need only three organization-specific parameters: a\nbaseline duration, in which neither complication occurs, an\neffect of opacity, and an effect of asperity. Then the four pos-\n415\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nsibilities get one, two, or three of the parameters. This kind\nof model is appropriate when the effect of opacity does not\ndepend on the level of asperity. Because this kind of inde-\npendence might not hold in cases of interest, we impose a\nweaker four-parameter specification. The fourth parameter\n(labeled as \u03c1\u223co below) can be either positive or negative, but in\nthis case its value is constrained, as we explain below. A\nnegative value means that the combination of complications\ncan be dealt with more quickly than when the complications\narise singly. A positive value means that the combination\nlengthens durations more than would be expected from\nknowledge of the separate effects. We think that positive val-\nues of this parameter are likely in real applications.\nAuxiliary Assumption 3 (A.3). The expected duration of a\nreorganization in a unit depends on (1) whether the induced\nviolation is foreseen and (2) whether the response to the\ninduced violation encounters culturally based opposition. In\ncombinations of these two conditions, the expected duration\nis constant over pairs of units and over time points. Thus,\nthere are four organization-specific (constant) characteristic\ndurations.\nAssume that four units in an organization experience induced\nviolations.\n\u0002o\u2203\u03c1o, \u03c1\n\u223c\no,\u03b8o,\u03b8\n\u223c\no\u2200u1,u2,u3,u4,t1,t2,t3,t4[O(o,p) \u2227\nU(u1,t1) \u2227 U(u2,t2) \u2227 U(u3,t3) \u2227 U(u4,t4) \u2227\n(v*u(u1,t1) = 1) \u2227 (y(u1,t1 = 0) \u2192 E{d(u1,t1) | \u03b4(u,t) = 1} = \u03b8o) \u2227\n(v*u(u2,t2) = 1) \u2227 (y(u2,t2 = 1) \u2192 E{d(u2,t2) | \u03b4(u,t) = 1} = \u03b8o + \u03c1o) \u2227\n(v*u(u3,t3) = 0) \u2227 (y(u3,t3 = 0) \u2192 E{d(u3,t3) | \u03b4(u,t) = 1} = \u03b8o + \u03b8\n\u223c\no) \u2227\n(v*u(u4,t4) = 0) \u2227 (y(u4,t4 = 1) \u2192 E{d(u4,t4) | \u03b4(u,t) = 1} = \u03b8o + \u03b8\n\u223c\no + \u03c1o + \u03c1\n\u223c\no)].\nBecause a duration cannot be negative, \u03b8o \u2265 0. P.1 states that\nunforeseen induced violations take longer to resolve than\nforeseen ones, which implies that \u03c1o > 0 (otherwise P.1\nwould be violated). Similarly, P.3 states that induced viola-\ntions whose attempted resolution meets cultural resistance\nlast longer than those that do not. This implies that (\u03b8\n\u223c\no > 0) \u2227\n(\u2013\u03c1o < \u03c1\n\u223c\no). We record these constraints in the following\nlemma.\nLemma 5 (L.5).\n\u0003p,o[O(o,p) \u2192 (\u03c1o > 0) \u2227 (\u03b8\n\u223c\no > 0) \u2227 (\u2013\u03c1o < \u03c1\n\u223c\no)].\nREORGANIZATION PERIODS\nThe central tenets of our argument hold that the expected\nduration of a reorganization in a random cascade increases\nwith opacity and asperity. In the case of opacity, this is\nbecause the agents cannot know a priori all of the adjust-\nments required to eliminate architectural code violations in an\nopaque organization. As a result, not all changes can be\nundertaken in parallel. Only when a cascade of adjustments\n416\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nwithin one part of the organization has played itself out does\na downstream unit have a clear understanding of the new\nconstraints.\nA potentially promising way of thinking formally about the\nlength of the period of reorganization in these cases is to\nview the subject as a queuing problem. Queuing theory pro-\nvides a framework for analyzing the behavior of queues\nincluding waiting times with uncertain (stochastic) arrivals. In\nthe usual queuing problem setup, the main modeling choices\nconcern (1) the rate and stochastic form of arrivals to the sys-\ntem; (2) the rate at which arrivals get served and the corre-\nsponding waiting times; and (3) the number of service agents\navailable. There are also endless potential complications such\nas queue discipline and waiting behavior.\nConsider the extreme case of an organization for which all\nadjustments must be done individually and in sequence, but\nthe recognition of what adjustments need to be made is par-\ntial and evolves randomly over time. The required individual\nadjustments might be seen as arrivals to a queuing system.\nBecause the adjustments can only be solved one at a time,\nthe system can be seen as possessing a single service\nagent. With further specification of the exact form of the\narrival process and the agent\u2019s speed, a variety of useful ana-\nlytical results can then be obtained (see, e.g., Gross and Hart,\n1985). For example, one could derive the average waiting\ntime from recognition to completion of a required adjust-\nment, as well as behavior of the whole system in terms of its\nbusy and idle periods, representing the time spent in reorga-\nnization. Further analyses could relax the assumptions of this\nsimple illustration. At this point in the development of the\ntheory, we concentrate on the simpler implications of opacity\nand asperity.\nHence, induced violations will arise at random. A unit might\nbe well on its way to resolving an induced violation when\nanother violation gets induced over another path in the pat-\ntern of architectural dominance relations. Hannan, P\u00f3los, and\nCarroll (2003a) argued that such a situation takes at least\ntwice as long to resolve as would an otherwise similar unin-\nterrupted spell of resolution. For example, when Hewlett\nPackard spun off what became known as Agilent Technolo-\ngies, the corporate headquarters of the new organization con-\nsolidated and centralized certain shared functions such as\ninformation technology that had been fully decentralized in\nthe parent company. For most functions, the consolidation\nprocess apparently took months to achieve. The implications\nof these changes for the various businesses will take much\nlonger to work out, because many units are somewhat\nopaque to the central administration. The company faces the\nreal danger that the tightening of local resources might dimin-\nish innovation in the long run, since the units historically had\nalmost full autonomy and did not need to ask for resources\nto attempt experimental projects as they might now.\nThe time required to resolve an inconsistency generally\ngrows with asperity. We argued above that this is because\nthe reactions are more intense, the opposition might not be\ncorrectly identified as cultural, and the broad basis of opposi-\n417\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ntion might require more managerial attention in fine-tuning\nthe structure in adjustment. Of course, holding constant the\nnumber of induced violations, the total time in reorganization\nwill increase with the strength of the cultural opposition. Cou-\npling these ideas with the earlier argument about the intrica-\ncy of organizational design yields the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 (T.1). The expected total time spent in reorgani-\nzation by an organization\u2019s units during a random cascade\nincreases monotonically with intricacy, Io, opacity, Po, and\nasperity, Ao.\n\u0003o,t [O(o,p) \u2227 (\u2206(o,t) = 1) \u2192 E{D(o,t)} = \u03b8oIo + \u03b8\n\u223c\noPo + (\u03c1oIo + \u03c1\n\u223c\noPo)Ao].\nProof. By definition, E{D(o,t)} = E{\u03a3 \u2329u\u2032,t\u2032\u232a\u2208K(u,t)d(u\u2032,t\u2032)}. The sum-\nmation ranges over all of the induced violations in the cas-\ncade. According to L.2, the number of induced violations in a\ncascade with random origin is given by Io. Therefore,\nE{D(o,t)} = Io E{d(u\u2032,t\u2032)}.\nAccording to the law of total probability (and given the\npremise that a change did occur at t),\nE{d(u\u2032,t\u2032)} =\nE{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227 (y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} Pr{v*u(u\u2032,t\u2033) = 1) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} + E{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227 (y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} Pr{v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} + E{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227 (y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} Pr{v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} + E{d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227 (y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} Pr{v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)}.\nGiven \u220f, A.1 and A.2, the foregoing can be expressed as\nE{d(u\u2032,t\u2032)} =\nE{(d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} (I*o \/ Io)(1 \u2013 Ao) + E{(d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} (I*o \/ Io)Ao + E{(d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0)} ((Io \u2013 I\n*\no)\/ Io)(1 \u2013 Ao) + E{(d(u\u2032,t\u2032 | v*u(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 0) \u2227\n(y(u\u2032,t\u2032) = 1)} ((Io \u2013 I\n*\no)\/ Io)Ao.\nUsing the expected durations given by A.3, we have:\nE{D(o,t)} = Io(\u03b8o(I*o \/ Io)(1 \u2013 Ao) + (\u03b8o + \u03c1o)(I*o \/ Io)Ao +\n(\u03b8o + \u03b8\n\u223c\no)((Io \u2013 I\n*\no) \/ Io)(1 \u2013 Ao) + (\u03b8o + \u03b8\n\u223c\no + \u03c1o + \u03c1\n\u223c\no)(Io \u2013 I\n*\no) \/ Io)Ao).\nUsing the definition of organizational opacity in D.7 (and rear-\nranging terms) concludes the proof.\n418\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nConsider the relevant cases in light of this theorem. The\nexpected total time reorganizing during a random cascade\nequals the sum of three terms. The first, \u03b8oIo, gives the\nexpected duration for an organization that is fully transparent,\nPo = 0, and whose organizational culture admits all possible\narchitectures, Ao = 0. Therefore, this result shows that the\nresult for Stage 1 of the theory persists as a special case of\ntransparency and no cultural restraint in the new formulation.\nSuppose that transparency is incomplete, Po > 0, but cultural\nrestraint is lacking, Ao = 0. Then the expected total time\nreorganizing equals \u03b8Io + \u03b8\n\u223c\noPo. Given the definition of opacity\nand L.3, this result says that the expected total time increas-\nes monotonically with opacity in the absence of cultural\nrestraint.\nFinally, bring asperity into the picture. The final term to be\nconsidered, (\u03c1oIo + \u03c1\n\u223c\noPo)Ao, shows that asperity interacts with\nintricacy and opacity in affecting the expected time reorganiz-\ning. The coefficient of the intricacy-asperity effect, Po, gives\nthe expected duration of a foreseen induced violation that\ninvolves a cultural violation. The coefficient of the opacity-\nasperity effect, \u03c1\u223co, Ao gives the expected duration of an\nunforeseen induced violation that involves a cultural violation.\nA.3 and L.5 say that all of the parameters, other than \u03c1\u223co, are\npositive. Even if \u03c1\u223co < 0, the combination of the last constraint\nexpressed in L.5 and the definition of Po imposes that the\noverall effect of Po and Ao be positive. Therefore, the expect-\ned total time reorganizing increases monotonically with intri-\ncacy, opacity, and asperity. It is nonetheless important to\nremember that these three factors might not vary indepen-\ndently. In particular, intricacy and opacity are definitionally\ndependent: a non-intricate organization cannot be opaque.\nMISSED OPPORTUNITIES\nWe focus on periods of reorganization because devoting\nattention, time, and energy to reorganization (adjusting codes\nto eliminate induced violations) diverts members of an organi-\nzation from the tasks that generate revenues. Therefore, any\nlengthy change process generally entails substantial opportu-\nnity costs. Opportunities are missed because managerial\nattention focuses on managing the change, production gets\ndisrupted, relations with customers are left unattended as\nresponsibilities are reallocated, and so forth. Each of these\nproblems becomes more serious as a reorganization length-\nens. During a reorganization period, considerable attention is\npaid to the fate of the new architecture. The units with\nchanged architectural codes generally face scrutiny, and non-\nconformity to the newly added code is noted. In other words,\nunlike normal functioning, in which managerial attention to\narchitectural conformity is partial and episodic, violations of\nnewly added code generally get noticed during a reorganiza-\ntion period. The resulting diversion of attention causes oppor-\ntunities to be missed.\nWe specify the consequences of missed opportunities in\nterms of the growth rate of resources. Let R(o,t) denote the\nrandom variable that records the level of organization o\u2019s\nresources at time t. Organizations lose resources during peri-\nods of reorganization, both because reorganization is costly\n419\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nand because directing resources and attention away from\nproduction dampens resource acquisition.\nAccording to the probability model \u220f, opportunities arrive at\nthe same constant rate, \u039e, for each organization in a popula-\ntion. An organization\u2019s architecture determines what part of\nthe organization can see a given opportunity; at the extreme,\nin an organization with only one unit, all of the relevant oppor-\ntunities arrive at the same unit. \u220f includes the assumption\nthat units within an organization are equally likely to experi-\nence the opportunity. Therefore, the arrival rate of opportuni-\nties to a unit in an organization with Uounits is \u03be \u0001 \u039e \/ Uo.\nWe want to focus on the expected difference in the number\nof opportunities missed over an interval for a reorganizing\nunit and an otherwise identical not-reorganizing one. Let the\nrandom variable m(u,w,w\u2032) give the number of opportunities\nmissed by unit u during the arbitrary interval [w,w \u2032) and let\nthe organization-level counterpart by M(o,w,w\u2032) \u0001\n\u03a3u:U(u,o)m(u,w,w\u2032). We want to characterize the expected value\nof m(u,w,w\u2032).\nWe begin by comparing two organizations, one that is reorga-\nnizing over the whole period being considered and one that is\nnot reorganizing at any time during the period.\nLemma 6 (L.6). (L.5 in Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2003a)\n\u0003o,u,u\u2032,t1,t2,t3,t4[O(o,p) \u2227\nU(u,o) \u2227 U(u\u2032,o) \u2227 \u2200w,w\u2032 [(t1 \u2264 w < t2) \u2227\n(t3 \u2264 w\u2032 < t4) \u2192 (RE(u,w) \u2227\n\u00acRE(u\u2032,w\u2032)] \u2192 (E{m(u,t1,t2)} = \u03beo(\u03b7 + \u03b7\u223c)(t2 \u2013 t1)) \u2227\n(E{m(u\u2032,t3,t4)} = \u03beo\u03b7(t4 \u2013 t3))].\nNext we want to extend the result to apply to a full cascade\nof changes for an organization.\nTheorem 2 (T.2). The expected number of opportunities\nmissed during a full cascade is the sum of (1) the baseline\nexpected number that would be missed over an interval had\nno reorganization taken place and (2) an excess expected\nnumber that increases monotonically with the product of the\norganization\u2019s intricacy, Io, opacity, Po, and asperity, Ao.\n\u0003o,u,t [O(o,p) \u2227 U(u,o) \u2227 (\u2206(o,t) = 1) \u2192\nE{M(o,t,t + S(o,t))} = \u039e\u03b7S(o,t) + \u03beo\u03b8(\u03b7oIo + \u03b7\u223coPo + (\u03c1oIo + \u03c1\u223coPo)Ao)].\nProof. The most-specific regularity chain combines the most\nspecific regularity chains supporting L.6 and T.1. According to\nL.6, each unit contributes \u03beo\u03b7oS(o,t) expected missed oppor-\ntunities, the baseline that holds whether or not a unit is in\nreorganization. This part of the process therefore contributes\n\u03beo\u03b7S(o,t)Uo = \u039e\u03b7oS(o,t) expected missed opportunities. Next\nconsider the additional expected missed opportunities due to \n420\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nreorganization. The expected total time spent reorganizing in\na complete cascade equals \u03b8(\u03b7oIo + \u03b7\n\u223c\noPo) + (\u03c1oIo + \u03c1\n\u223c\noPo)Ao\naccording to T.1. The expected number of excess opportuni-\nties missed during reorganization is this expected time multi-\nplied by \u0005o.\nWe do not assume any knowledge of the function that\nrelates missed opportunities to the growth in resources.\nInstead we argue for a weaker monotonicity relationship,\nwhich affects what follows: instead of getting precise results\nabout expectations, we get monotonicity statements relating\nintricacy, opacity, and asperity to resource growth and mortal-\nity hazards.\nPostulate 4 (P.4). Consider a pair of organizations in the\nsame population with equal stocks of resources at the start\nof a time interval. If one misses more opportunities over the\ninterval than the other, then its expected growth in resources\nis lower. Otherwise, the expected growth in resources for\nthe two is the same. (The equality condition follows from the\nbackground assumption that the trichotomy relation holds,\nthat if it is not the case that a > b or a < b, then a = b.)\n\u0001o,o\u2032,s,s\u2032,w,w\u2032 [O(o,p) \u2227 O(o\u2032,p) \u2227\n(R(o,s) = R(o\u2032,s\u2032)) \u2227\n(M(o,s,w) > M(o\u2032,s\u2032,w\u2032)) \u2192 E{R(o,w)} < E{R(o\u2032,w\u2032 )}].\nWe can use the foregoing argument to compare what hap-\npens to two organizations that experience cascades of\nchange. A subtle issue needs attention. The two cascades\nmight differ in temporal scope, S(o,t). We want to compare\nexperiences over the time span of the longer cascade, so\nthat we get the full scope of both cascades. Things get very\ncomplicated if we allow the possibility that the organization\nwith the shorter cascade starts another cascade within the\nperiod of comparison. So we want to restrict the comparison\nto the case in which no subsequent initiations of cascades\noccur within the period of comparison.\nNotation. To avoid repeating a very complicated expression\nin a series of lemmas and theorems, we introduce some\nnotational shorthand.\nZ = max(S(o,t),S(o\u2032,t\u2032 )).\nThe formula \u03a8 stands for the following formula: the entities\nbeing compared, o and o\u2032, are organizations in the same pop-\nulation with equal resources, experience architectural\nchanges at times t and t\u2032, respectively, and neither experi-\nences another (uninduced) architectural change until the end\nof the longer of the two cascades of change.\n\u03a8 \u2194 O(o,p) \u2227 O(o\u2032,p) \u2227 (\u2206(o,t) = \u2206(o\u2032,t\u2032) = 1) \u2227\n(R(o,t) = R(o\u2032,t\u2032 )) \u2227 \u2200s,s\u2032 [(t < s \u2264 (t + Z)) \u2227\n421\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\n(t\u2032 < s\u2032 \u2264 (t\u2032 + Z)) \u2192 \u2206(o,s) = \u2206(o\u2032,s\u2032 ) = 0].\nThe key implication of this argument can be captured by the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 7 (L.7). An organization\u2019s expected rate of growth in\nresources during a cascade with a random origin decreases\nwith the total time reorganizing, D(o,t) (L.6 in Hannan, P\u00f3los,\nand Carroll, 2003a):\n\u0001o,o\u2032,t,t\u2032 [\u03a8 \u2227 (D(o,t) > D(o\u2032,t\u2032)) \u2192 E{R(o,t + Z)} < E{R(o\u2032,t\u2032 + Z)}].\nCHANGE AND ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY\nHannan and Freeman\u2019s (1984) theory of structural inertia\nassumed that the hazard of mortality rises monotonically with\nthe duration of the period of reorganization. We now show\nthat this premise follows as a theorem in the new theory. Let\n\u00b5(o,t) denote the mortality hazard for organization o at time t.\nA hazard equals the ratio of the probability density of the\nlength of lifetimes in a population to the survivor function. In\nother words, the hazard (at a particular time) provides a local\ncharacterization of the probability distribution of length of life-\ntimes. This means that we can formulate propositions and\ntheorems about hazards directly in terms of the hazard func-\ntion, rather than in terms of expectations. (If we wanted to\nformulate this part of the argument in terms of expected val-\nues, then we would consider expected lifetimes.) Nearly all\ntreatments of the relationship of size and resources with\nmortality assume that organizations with access to greater\nresources can better withstand life-threatening environmental\nshocks (Carroll and Hannan, 2000).\nPostulate 5 (P.5). An organization\u2019s hazard of mortality\ndeclines monotonically with its level of resources (P. 3 in\nHannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2003a):\n\u0001o,o\u2032,s,s\u2032 [O(o,p) \u2227 O(o\u2032,p) \u2227 (R(o,s) > R(o\u2032,s\u2032 )) \u2192 \u00b5(o,s) < \u00b5(o\u2032,s\u2032 )].\nThe argument in the preceding sections identifies structural\nand cultural features that lengthen expected durations of cas-\ncades. If stocks of resources fall monotonically during cas-\ncades, then the factors that lengthen cascades make change\nmore risky. We now provide a formal statement of these\nimplications for pairs of organizations that experience random\narchitectural changes and differ in the structural and cultural\nfactors that affect expected cascade length. As noted above,\nthese theorems give monotonicity relations. Each considers\none of the structural\/cultural factors in isolation from the oth-\ners. This is because the theory contains regularity chains that\nwarrant inferences about such relations.\nTheorem 3 (T.3). The increase in the hazard of mortality due\nto an architectural change grows monotonically with intricacy.\n422\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\n\u0003o,o\u2032,t,t\u2032 [\u03a8 \u2227 (Io > Io\u2032) \u2192\nt+Z\u222b\nt\n\u00b5(o,v)dv >\nt\u2032+Z\u222b\nt\u2032\n\u00b5(o\u2032,v)dv].\nProof. The most-specific regularity chain begins with the\nintension of Io > Io\u2032. T.1 ties this condition to the expected\nlength of a reorganization period. In the next step, we\nassume that the facts agree with the expectations: that the\nactual duration for the more intricate organization exceeds\nthat of the less intricate one. It follows that there is a period\nduring which both organizations are in reorganization. Under\nthe assumption that they started with the same resource lev-\nels, according to P.4, the expected resource levels of the pair\nare the same when the reorganization for the less intricate\norganization ends. From that time point until the end of reor-\nganization for the more intricate organization, the expected\nresource levels fall for the latter but not for the former,\naccording to this postulate. Again if the facts agree with the\ndifference in expected values, then the mortality hazard for\nthe more intricate organization exceeds that of the less intri-\ncate one over this period, by P.5. Hence, the regularity chain\nstates that the hazards of the two do not differ over the initial\npart of their common period of reorganization but do differ\nafterwards, until the reorganization for the more intricate\norganization ends. The regularity chain supports the claim of\nthe theory. The available postulates and auxiliary assumptions\ndo not support any countervailing regularity chain.\nTheorem 4 (T.4). The increase in the hazard of mortality due\nto an architectural change grows monotonically with opacity.\n\u0003o,o\u2032,t,t\u2032 [\u03a8 \u2227 (Po > Po\u2032) \u2192\nt+Z\u222b\nt\n\u00b5(o,v)dv >\nt\u2032+Z\u222b\nt\u2032\n\u00b5(o\u2032,v)dv].\nProof. The proof follows the lines of the proof of T.3.\nTheorem 5 (T.5). The increase in the hazard of mortality due\nto an architectural change grows monotonically with asperity.\n\u0003o,o\u2032,t,t\u2032 [\u03a8 \u2227 (Ao > Ao\u2032) \u2192\nt+Z\u222b\nt\n\u00b5(o,v)dv >\nt\u2032+Z\u222b\nt\u2032\n\u00b5(o\u2032,v)dv].\nProof. The proof follows the lines of the proof of T.3.\nNow we can see another advantage of applying the non-\nmonotonic logic in formalizing organization theory. Theorems\n3, 4, and 5 state that intricacy, opacity, and asperity increase\nthe hazard due to change. Suppose that we encounter a\nclass of simple (low in intricacy) but opaque (or simple and\nhigh in asperity) organizations. What do we predict? Two\narguments that do not clearly differ in specificity point in\nopposite directions, a case that logicians call a Nixon dia-\nmond (see P\u00f3los and Hannan, 2002, for details). The lack of\nan established specificity difference leads us, according to\nthe methodological principle embedded in the logic, to refrain\nfrom making a prediction (an inference, more generally). More\ninformation is needed, perhaps concerning the exact func-\ntional form of the relationships involved. In any event, given\n423\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nthe present state of knowledge (as reflected in the premises\nof the theory), no prediction can be offered.\nIf this result seems undesirable, consider the main alterna-\ntive. Suppose that we had constructed the theory in classical\nfirst-order logic. Then the three universally quantified theo-\nrems (stated in terms of comparisons of strictly monotonic\nfunctions for intricacy, opacity, and asperity) would imply that\nthere could not be any pairs of organizations such that one is\nmore intricate and the other has greater opacity or that one\nhas greater opacity and the other has higher asperity and so\nforth (see P\u00e9li, P\u00f3los, and Hannan, 2000: 201). Consider a\nsimple example. Suppose we have three functions, p\u0002, q\u0002,\nand r\u0002, and the following postulates:\n\u2200x,y[p(x) > p(y) \u2192 q(x) > q(y)];\n\u2200x,y [r(x) > r(y) \u2192 q(x) > q(y)].\nA logically equivalent syntactic variant of the first postulate is\n\u2200x,y [p(y) > p(x) \u2192 q(y) > q(x)].\nFrom the second postulate, by contraposition, we have:\n\u2200x,y [\u00ac(q(x) > q(y)) \u2192\u00ac(r(x) > r(y))].\nThe antecedent of this formula can be satisfied if q(y) > q(x).\nTherefore, by the chain rule one can derive\n\u2200x,y [p(y) > p(x) \u2192\u00ac(r(x) > r(y))].\nThis form of deduction is not warranted in the nonmonotonic\nlogic, because this logic does not support the contraposition\noperation (on the grounds that reasoning about causal stories\ndoes not warrant it).\nWe conclude that a first-order version of the theory is too\nstrong for the knowledge base on which it is built. It implies\nsurprising theorems: intricacy is monotonically related to\nopacity and also to asperity, and so forth. Do we want such\ntheorems? Clearly not. We think that these conclusions\nmight easily turn out to be false empirically. Moreover, they\ndo not appear to reflect the intuitions that motivate the theo-\nry. Having such theorems as a permanent part of the theory\nwould impose undesirable constraints on further develop-\nment of the theory. So reliance on a first-order formulation\nwould have us painting ourselves into a corner from the per-\nspective of future development of the theory. None of these\nundesirable consequences arise in the (weaker) nonmonoton-\nic formulation.\n424\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nTHE BARINGS BANK COLLAPSE\u2014AN INTERPRETATION\nThe spectacular collapse of Barings Brothers, a venerable\nBritish bank, in February 1995 is widely blamed on a single\n\u201crogue\u201d trader named Nicholas Leeson, who worked in Sin-\ngapore. While there is no doubt that Leeson\u2019s activities\ndirectly generated the losses that caused the bank to fail, the\nconditions under which such activities could occur and per-\nsist undetected is plausibly explainable by our theory: the\nsame activities attempted in a different organization or in Bar-\nings at a different time would likely have been caught early\non and stopped long before they led to huge losses, let alone\ntook down the entire bank.\nNicholas Leeson worked for Baring Futures Singapore (BFS),\nwhich was an entity operated by Baring Securities Ltd. (BSL).\nBSL originated in 1984 as the subsidiary Baring Far East\nSecurities (it was renamed in 1986) when the executives of\nBaring Brothers acquired a small stockbrokering firm named\nHenderson Crosthwaite in anticipation of the United King-\ndom\u2019s deregulation of financial markets in 1986, the so-called\nBig Bang. Before the Big Bang, British merchant banks could\nissue securities, but they could not trade or distribute them.\nBarings had been a major player in the old system\u2014since\n1762 it had been run as a family-run merchant bank with an\nenviable client list including royalty from several countries\nand, more recently, eminent international firms.\nThe Big Bang promised to modernize British financial mar-\nkets. Like Barings, most banks made plans to enter the\nnewly deregulated areas, either on their own through expan-\nsion or acquisition or through the establishment of alliances\nwith brokerage partners. Other banks typically set up more\nintegrated structures for taking on the newly allowed broker-\ning-trading activities. The original arrangement at Barings was\nnotable for the independence it offered BSL:\nThe new subsidiary was to be completely autonomous, with sepa-\nrate management and office. In order to give the employees a direct\ninterest in the annual results of the firm, it was to retain 50 percent\nof its profits before tax, after a capital charge, for distribution among\nits staff, with the other 50 percent going to Baring Brothers & Co.,\nits parent. (Rawnsley, 1995: 39)\nThe autonomy offered in the Barings structure proved to be\nboth a blessing and a curse. In a short time, Barings was able\nto move quickly into the new activities and to avoid the types\nof organizational and cultural conflicts hampering banks that\nattempted to build integrated structures. Looking back on the\nfirst decade of operation, BSL\u2019s founder concluded:\nWe had an environment in which we could build the business, in\nthat we were totally independent of Baring Brothers, so we had no\ndaily cultural battle to fight, which a lot of other firms had after the\nBig Bang when they tried to weld a whole lot of people who were\nnot suited to working together. The merchant banking culture and\nthe brokering culture are very different at the end of the day. (quot-\ned in Rawnsley, 1995: 40)\nIt helped, too, that much of the new unit was located halfway\naround the world, based in Japan. Given such autonomy, BSL\nwas able to trade at prices Barings would have found horrify-\n425\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ning, to develop a strong customer service orientation, and to\ndiscover and reap newly developing markets such as that of\nJapanese warrants. The result was a highly profitable, if high-\nflying and, occasionally, chaotic entity. Both returns and firm\ngrowth were dramatic in the early years. Before the market\ncrash of October 1987, \u201cSecurities were providing over two-\nthirds of the bank\u2019s profits\u201d (Rawnsley, 1995: 66).\nBy the 1990s, the bubble clearly had deflated. Envy within\nthe bank and elsewhere developed when freewheeling BSL\nexecutives were publicly reported to have some of the high-\nest compensation in the U.K. (in 1986, the highest paid man\nat BSL did in fact hold the top position). The market down-\nturn in 1990, coupled with the associated major losses in\nwarrants, made BSL a less attractive subunit to Barings offi-\ncials. BSL argued for further aggressive growth, including\nmovement into proprietary trading, which required additional\ninfusions of capital from London. Taking on added risk while\nfaced with a lack of information and control did not seem a\ngood proposition to the Barings people, many of whom had\nbeen waiting for their chance to reel BSL back in. Even the\nBSL chief admitted that the operation had grown larger than\nthe existing organizational and management controls could\nhandle. At this juncture, both Barings and BSL wanted to for-\nmalize the organization, moving it away from the entrepre-\nneurial structure that had been so conducive to growth. But\nBSL wanted to retain autonomy, while Barings insisted that\nthe two entities be integrated. A comprehensive study of\nBSL was initiated after some unexpected losses coincided\nwith the awarding of large executive bonuses. The subse-\nquent report revealed \u201cthe absence of controls; there was no\nbusiness plan or strategy, no effective control system or bud-\ngets, no management, offices had been opened all over the\nplace . . . [with the chief executive officer] trying to micro-\nmanage it\u201d (quoted in Rawnsley, 1995: 95).\nTwo actions were taken in response to these events. First,\nthe BSL unit was \u201csolo consolidated\u201d within the Barings\nBank. This action mainly addressed regulatory issues. Solo\nconsolidation allowed the bank to treat BSL as a branch of\nthe bank for regulatory reporting purposes. This meant that\nloans made to the BSL from the parent bank \u201cwould not be\nsubject to the large exposures, reporting requirements and\nconstraints\u201d (San and Kuang, 1995: 97). In reporting to the\nBank of England, the two entities would file only a single\nreturn. Among the restrictions for solo consolidation are that\nthe unit be wholly funded by its parent, that it be 75 percent\nowned by the parent, that the parent maintain effective con-\ntrol, possess sufficient capital, and that there should be no\nobstacles to transfers such as overseas exchange limits. Sec-\nond, a major restructuring plan was adopted in fall 1992, with\nthe goal of merging the bank and BSL into an integrated\ninvestment bank. The plan would reduce costs and staff by\nsome 15\u201320 percent, closing some offices and selling off\nothers. Warrant trading was to be shut down. The savings\nwas projected at 20 million pounds annually. Barings was\nthen to invest another 45 million pounds into the business.\nWithin three years, BSL was to be fully merged into the\nnewly integrated investment bank.\n426\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nThe author of the Barings study assumed the position of\nchief operating officer (COO) and began restructuring activi-\nties. The new environment has been described as a \u201cpolitical\nhotbed.\u201d Within six months, the founding director of BSL\nresigned, along with other key figures. Senior management\nwas then restructured, with the COO appointed as chief\nexecutive officer (CEO) and other Barings people forming a\nnew top management team at BSL. The new CEO himself\nwas not familiar to the BSL staff, personally or professionally.\nThe effort to integrate the two units involved the establish-\nment, in 1993, of an umbrella organization known as Baring\nInvestment Bank, composed of four major groups. The two\nlargest groups were the Bank Group and the Equity Brokering\nand Trading Group. The main idea was to \u201ccoordinate product\nactivities on a global basis along with the decentralized\nauthority\u201d (Rawnsley, 1995: 128). Management authority was\nto be delegated locally to four regional centers in Tokyo,\nHong Kong, Singapore, and New York. Profits were to be the\nresponsibility of product groups, while the local offices were\nto provide infrastructure and facilitate information sharing. A\nmatrix reporting system was put in place to provide stronger\ncontrols and more accountability.\nThe expected difficulties of this integration seem to have\nbeen anticipated in the announcement of a three-year win-\ndow for implementation. Still, it is doubtful that the confusion\nabounding during the reorganization period had been antici-\npated. The cultures proved to be hostile to each other, and\nmany key employees resented integration. The old support\nsystems (accountancy, treasury, and risk) were found to be\noutdated and in need of updating before the new controls\ncould work. At the same time, the firm was pushing ahead\nas fast as possible to develop new business, often outrun-\nning its support structure. According to Rawnsley (1995:\n133),\n. . . the new reporting lines and responsibilities were not perceived\nto be clear by many, nor were they fully understood. It appears that\nno complete organizational chart was prepared and disseminated\nwhen the organizational structure was being formulated . . . this sit-\nuation was exacerbated in Baring Securities\u2019 Asian offices where a\nseries of personnel changes took place.\nIt was in this context of urgency mired in confusion that Lee-\nson worked. He understood the need to show profits, and he\nalso realized that the formal and informal controls left much\nroom for maneuvering when his returns were not up to par.\nAmong other things, he was in charge of his own trading set-\ntlements, something simply not allowed in the securities\nbusiness. It was also unclear who was supposed to super-\nvise him, the local boss or the product group supervisor. As\nlong as he showed profits on paper, it seemed that no one\ncared. Moreover, many were willing to run interference for\nhim, allowing him to get more capital and to avoid the scruti-\nny of London, in part because the \u201cprofits\u201d he generated\ncontributed to their bonuses. So, when the market turned\nagainst him, Leeson was able to make larger and larger bets\nusing the firm\u2019s capital. When the bets challenged the bank\u2019s\n427\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nentire capital structure, they finally were detected. But, of\ncourse, it was then too late\u2014Barings was bankrupt.\nWithout denying Leeson\u2019s guilt, most subsequent assess-\nments of the meltdown attribute the failure to the reorganiza-\ntion and its attendant problems. For instance, Rawnsley\n(1995: 184) concluded that \u201cduring this state of flux, the\norganization was in a position of considerable vulnerability;\nadequate controls were not in place quickly enough for man-\nagement to detect the trading losses.\u201d She quotes George\nMacLean, head of the Bank Group: \u201cI believe the seeds of\nthis [collapse] were sown when we went into Baring Securi-\nties Ltd. to bring together the two companies and made the\nassumption that the quality controls we [Baring Brothers] had\ncould get quickly installed there. As it turned out, that\nappears not to be true.\u201d\nThe most authoritative account comes from San and Kuang\n(1995: 39) in Singapore. It concludes:\nThe organization structure within which Mr. Leeson operated, partic-\nularly from the latter half of 1993 through to February 1995 when\nthe Baring Group collapsed, far from embodying some form of inte-\ngrated control mechanisms with clear lines of accountability, was\nporous and ill-defined.\nIn particular:\n1) there was confusion as to the reporting lines and functional\nresponsibilities due to the re-organization of the Baring Group;\n2) the matrix management structure did not work in practice, in rela-\ntion to Mr. Leeson. Mr. Leeson\u2019s local managers took a limited view\nof their responsibilities. For much of the time Mr. Leeson was trad-\ning, it was not clear who his product managers were. Even when\nthis was resolved, his product managers, due to their lack of\ndetailed knowledge of his trading activities, were not able to exer-\ncise their functions effectively;\n3) Mr. Leeson was in charge of both the front and back office func-\ntions of BFS. Hence, he was in a position (which he exploited) to\noverride internal controls; and\n4) the various departments within the Baring Group, which dealt\nwith matters arising from Mr. Leeson\u2019s trading activities were not\nproperly co-ordinated and did not exchange pertinent information\nwhich they had in respect of these activities.\nIf there had been effective checks or organisational controls imple-\nmented by qualified personnel, Mr. Leeson would not have been in\na position to procure the vast remittances to BFS to finance the\ntrades booked in account 88888, which the senior managers of the\nBaring Group now claim they know nothing about.\nObviously, the Barings organization was in a period of reorga-\nnization, as we define the term, when Leeson undertook his\nmisguided actions. It is noteworthy that the Singapore\ninspectors ultimately blamed the failure of the bank on the\nchaotic conditions created by this state, much as our theory\nsuggests. It is also notable that the losses he incurred did not\nresult from a single hidden action or two but, instead, from\nhundreds of actions sustained over many months.\nThe reorganization period at Barings might be seen as lasting\neither ten years (from the establishment of BSL in 1986 to\n1995) or six years (from the beginning of the efforts to rein\nin BSL in 1990). The case for choosing the later date\n428\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nassumes that the two major changes (establishment of BSL\nand its later reintegration into the bank) were independent\nevents. The case for choosing the earlier date rests on the\nassumption that the initial decoupled structure at BSL was\nnot fully compatible with the organization\u2019s codes\u2014it was\njust a matter of time until their resolution was attempted. So,\nthe eventual reintegration effort can be seen as a major cas-\ncading change. The cultural clashes and conflicts visible for\nthe duration of BSL\u2019s life suggest that this is the better inter-\npretation; they also suggest that BSL encountered cultural\nopposition from the old guard.\nThe initial autonomy of BSL meant that it was free to adapt\nto the new business and to the local environment. But it also\nseems that Barings officials underestimated the potential\nproblems associated with setting up and operating a stand-\nalone securities business in Asia. Of course, these officials\nbelieved that the information they had was adequate to\nunderstand and control what was going on below. Nonethe-\nless, it seems that they failed to foresee two things about\ncontrol in the new Barings. First, the centuries-old traditional\ninformal control system, based on class homogeneity and\nbackground, was ineffective with these new heterogeneous\nemployees. Second, the existing formal information and con-\ntrol systems required transaction-specific knowledge and\nsafeguards to operate effectively. Given their own back-\ngrounds and the bank\u2019s history, the leaders lacked this knowl-\nedge and failed to appreciate its importance. Officials also\nseem to have failed to appreciate that the compensation lev-\nels and work rules necessary to motivate the entrepreneurial\ngroup in Asia on a par with competitors would eventually\ngenerate cultural opposition from the more traditional parts of\nthe bank. Tradition at Barings had produced a culture with\nhigh asperity that would not readily accept these architectural\nchanges.\nLater, opacity in the organization caused leading Barings offi-\ncials in London and elsewhere to underestimate the costs of\nthe reintegration effort and hence to initiate it. In retrospect,\nit appears, from the perspective of our theory, that many\ninduced architectural code violations needed to be resolved\nand that these could not all be undertaken in parallel, as\nmany were interdependent. Yet the bank could not devote all\nits resources to this effort. It had to continue to operate and\nto attempt to grow in a competitive environment in the midst\nof the reorganization.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have attempted here to offer an explanation for why\nthings so often go badly awry when organizations seek to\nchange their architectures. Our theory extends a formal\nmodel of cascading organizational change (Hannan, P\u00f3los,\nand Carroll, 2003a). It examined the implications of opacity,\ndefined as limited foresight about unit interconnections, and\nasperity, defined as normative restrictiveness to certain archi-\ntectural features for organizational change. We argued that\nopacity leads actors to underestimate the lengths of periods\nof reorganization and the associated costs of change, thereby\nprompting them to undertake changes with adverse conse-\n429\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\nAmelio, G.\n1998 On the Firing Line: My 500\nDays at Apple.

As with organizational intricacy, both opacity and\nasperity serve to lengthen the total time that the organization\nspends reorganizing and increase the associated opportunity\ncosts. The central theorems stated that the likely deleterious\neffect of a change in architecture on mortality hazards\nincreases with the intricacy of the organizational design, the\norganization\u2019s opacity, and asperity. This theorem has evolu-\ntionary implications: intricate, opaque organizations character-\nized by cultural asperity will tend to get themselves into trou-\nble by undertaking changes that turn out to cost much more\nthan was foreseen\u2014costs that cannot be compensated by\nthe benefits that normally accrue to the new architecture\n(Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2004).\nREFERENCES\nAPPENDIX: Theoretical Methodology\nIn logic, monotonicity means that adding premises to an argument cannot\noverthrow implications that hold for the simpler premise set. If argumenta-\ntion is nonmonotonic, then adding more specific premises can eliminate\nwhat had been implications in an argument. P\u00f3los and Hannan (2002, 2004)\nargued that theory building has this nonmonotonic character: better-informed\nstages of a theory in flux might vitiate implications that were justified in less-\nwell-informed stages.\nIn formalizing arguments about organizational structure, change, and the haz-\nard of mortality, we used a nonstandard logic designed to represent the non-\nmonotonic argumentation in theory building (P\u00f3los and Hannan, 2004). This\nappendix summarizes the key aspects of this language. The distinctive logi-\ncal component of the language is the definition of four quantifiers: the classi-\ncal universal quantifier, \u2200, and three non-classical quantifiers. The first of\nthese, \u0001, is designed to represent what P\u00f3los and Hannan (2002) called\ncausal stories, rules with possible exceptions. The second, \u0003, quantifies\nderived implications, what presumably follows from an argument built partly\non causal stories. The third nonmonotonic quantifier, \u0002, is used in express-\ning auxiliary assumptions, propositions that are not enduring components of\nthe substantive theory but that allow certain conclusions to be derived from\nthe main postulates.\nThe language of theory building (P\u00f3los and Hannan, 2004) accommodates\nthree properties that generally characterize theories under construction (\u201cin\nflux\u201d). Such theories are obviously incomplete. First, they are not what logi-\ncians call categorical: some classical first-order sentences might be neither\ntrue nor false at a particular stage of the theory. Theory building in this\nrespect involves efforts to eliminate the \u201cunknown\u201d truth-values and to\nreplace them with sentences (formulae) that are either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d\nSecond, at least some causal stories are rules with exceptions, rather than\nuniversally quantified sentences. Third, a theory in flux might lack some rele-\nvant causal stories, and development of the theory might add new rules.\nThe language of theory building (\u0004TB) marks the sentences that are responsi-\nble for nonmonotonicity with the non-classical quantifiers. The key substan-\ntive ingredients of a theory, the specific causal stories, differ from classical\nfirst-order (universal) principles in two ways. First, causal stories are more\nstable than classical principles, which can be overturned by a single coun-\nterexample. The language treats causal stories as informationally stable: they\nare retained even when their first-order consequences are falsified. Instead\nof being eliminated, the effects of causal stories are controlled (and possibly\noverridden) by more specific arguments. Second, \u0004TB interprets casual sto-\nries as what linguists call generic sentences, which express general, but not\nuniversal, ideas. The important point is that the truth conditions of a generic\nsentence cannot be expressed in terms of particular cases; they provide\ndefault rules that tell what ought to be expected under normal conditions.\nThe \u201cnormally\u201d label for the quantifier \u0001 signals that the sentence being\nquantified is a default rule.\nTheory building usually involves the commitment to informational stability.\nAs a theory develops, new knowledge adds new causal stories, and the\nnew, more specific rules can override the older, more general rules. This\nleads to a new stage of the theory. If, however, the new knowledge casts\nserious doubt on an accepted causal story, then the situation is different. If\nthe new knowledge is dependable, then the old causal story should be dis-\ncarded. Such a departure from the strategy of maintaining informational sta-\nbility means that the old theory is replaced by a new one.\n\u0004TB marks the sentences that can be erased by theory development (the\nimplications of rules with exceptions) with the quantifier \u0003. Because causal\nstories are default rules, implications drawn from them on the basis of the\nbest available evidence are defeasible.\nOur formalization uses some classical mathematics, especially probability\ntheory and linear algebra. Because the logic of reasoning in these fields of\nmathematics is classical first-order logic, we developed an interface to com-\nbine the classical reasoning and the default reasoning. This interface con-\nsists of a special kind of auxiliary assumption. We use the \u0002 quantifier to\nmark the auxiliary assumptions.\nThe interface that matters most in our formalization concerns the role of\nmathematical expectations. Our probabilistic arguments yield differences in\nexpected value for certain random variables; the causal stories connect the\n431\/ASQ, September 2003\nFog of Change\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\ndifferences of factual values of the same variables to certain other variables.\nSuppose that a theory stage implies that the expected value of a random\nvariable for one entity is larger than for another: E{Y(a)} > E{Y(b)}. In this\ncase, we argue that the same theory stage should be held to presume that a\nnormal outcome is that Y(a) > Y(b). This consideration yields the following\nassumption schema:\n\u0002a,b[E{Y(a)} > E{Y(b)} \u2192 Y(a) > Y(b)].\nWe call this formula an assumption schema because one can substitute any\nrandom variable for Y and any number of equally long sequences for a and b\nand the resulting formula will be an acceptable auxiliary assumption. It is\neasy to see that these formulae are not causal stories; they are auxiliary\npremises that we think make sense in the context. Auxiliary assumptions sit\nbetween causal stories and implications (presumptions). \u0004TB treats them as\nassumptions but sets their truth conditions to those of presumptions.\nCausal stories refer to regularities in the world. In \u0004TB, they are true if the\nclaimed regularity is present in the world, and they are false otherwise. This\nmakes their falsification and verification equally difficult, though not impossi-\nble. This formal language uses a model-theoretic approach to logic. It builds\nmodels for the premises and uses these models to identify the implications\nof the premises. Premises that provide only partial information, therefore,\ncannot describe the world completely. Instead of giving details about the\nactual world, default rules describe several alternative pictures, one of which\nis the picture of the real world. Logicians call these alternative pictures possi-\nble worlds. In contrast, building a model for classical logic needs to refer to\nonly one possible world, the actual one. Logics designed to study arguments\nthat deal with alternative possibilities are called intensional logics (Gamut,\n1991 provided an accessible overview of developments in intensional logic).\nThe intension of a sentence is a function that tells its truth value in all possi-\nble worlds; we denote the intension of the sentence \u03c6 as \u0001\u03d5\u0002.\nA theory stage has two components: a set of possible worlds and a set of\nregularities (causal stories). The first component captures the factual infor-\nmation: it includes only those possible worlds that satisfy the factual, first-\norder, premises. \u0004TB models regularities as pairs of open-formula intensions:\nthe first element in the pair is the antecedent in an implication, and the sec-\nond is the consequent. Theory augmentations with auxiliary assumptions are\nrepresented by theory stages made as similar to the not-augmented theory\nstage as possible while making the auxiliary assumptions true.\nArguments are modeled by regularity chains. To test whether a theory stage\nimplies a formula of the form\n\u0003[\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8],\none should take the most-specific regularity chains that connect \u0001\u03d5\u0002 to \u0001\u03c8\u0002\nand demonstrate that at least one of them is more specific than any regulari-\nty chain that connects \u0001\u03d5\u0002 to \u0001\u00ac\u03c8\u0002. Here we can restrict ourselves to the first\nhalf of the task because the arguments do not supply any regularity chains\nthat connect \u0001\u03d5\u0002 to \u0001\u00ac\u03c8\u0002 in the theorems and lemmas that we prove.\n432\/ASQ, September 2003\n#1341-ASQ V48 N3-Sept 2003\u2014file: 48302-hannan\n\n"}
