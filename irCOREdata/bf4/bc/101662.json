Introduction \nThe almost ideal demand system (AIDS), initiated by Deaton and Muellbauer \n(1980), has been the most commonly used system model in demand studies over the \nlast two decades. According to Buse (1994), there were 89 empirical applications \npublished during the period 1980-1991. Most studies during this period used static \nspecifications and focused on the choices of linear or non-linear specifications and on \n                                                           \n*\n Corresponding author.

Eventually, the linear approximation to the AIDS \n(denoted as LAIDS) became the preferred functional form and dominated the \napplications.  \nWithin the tourism context, the application of the AIDS modelling approach is still \nrelatively rare.  Exceptions are De Mello et al (2002), Divisekera (2003), Durbarry \nand Sinclair (2003), Fujii et al (1985), Lyssiotou (2001), O\u2019Hagan and Harrison \n(1984), Papatheodorou (1999), Syriopoulos and Sinclair (1993) and White (1985). \nThe specifications of LAIDS models in all of these studies, except Durbarry and \nSinclair (2003), are static and can only give estimates of long-run demand elasticities.   \nSince the mid-1990s, more and more attention has been paid to the dynamics of \ndemand systems. The concepts of cointegration (CI) and the error correction \nmechanism have been introduced into the specifications of the LAIDS in order to \nexamine both long-run and short-run features of consumer behaviour. Applications of \nthe dynamic LAIDS, which incorporates the error correction mechanism into LAIDS \nspecifications, have appeared in such areas as the demand for non-durable goods, food \nand meat products (Attfield, 1997; Balcombe and Davis, 1996; Edgerton et al, 1996; \nKaragiannis and Velentzas, 1997; Karagiannis et al, 2000 and 2002). In the tourism \ncontext, Durbarry and Sinclair\u2019s (2003) exploratory study specifies an EC-LAIDS to \nanalyse the demand for tourism to Italy, Spain and the UK by French residents. \nHowever, the short-term demand elasticities and the forecasting ability of the dynamic \nLAIDS are not discussed in their study.  \nAnother highly significant development in econometrics has been the introduction \nof the state space technique, which was originally developed in the field of \nengineering. The state space technique allows parameters in econometric models to \nvary over time, so that the dynamics of changing economic regimes, especially \nserious structural breaks, can be readily accommodated. Compared with traditional \nmodelling approaches incorporating the fixed-parameter (FP) assumption, the time \nvarying parameter (TVP) model has shown obvious superiority in terms of forecasting \naccuracy. However, most applications of the TVP technique are still restricted to \nsingle-equation modelling approaches, and studies which combine the TVP technique \nand system of equations models are extremely rare. To date no published studies \nemploying the TVP-LAIDS technique exist. \nThe primary aim of this paper is to develop TVP-LAIDS models in both long-run \n(LR) and error-correction (EC) forms and to compare their forecasting performance \nwith the fixed-parameter counterparts in the tourism context. The TVP-LR-LAIDS \nand TVP-EC-LAIDS will shed new light on studies of demand modelling and \nforecasting. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains the \nforecasting methodologies used in this paper, starting with the conventional \nstatic\/long-run LAIDS, followed by the fixed-parameter EC-LAIDS and TVP-LAIDS. \nEstimation of the TVP-LAIDS using the Kalman filter algorithm is the focus of this \nsection. Section 3 provides empirical results for the various LAIDS models, together \nwith their forecasting performance results. Section 4 summarises and concludes the \npaper. \n2. Methodologies \nWhen the AIDS was originally introduced by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), it \ntook a purely static form. With the introduction of the error correction mechanism into \nthe traditional linear AIDS, the dynamic linear AIDS was developed. In addition the \n 3 \nsuccessful application of the state space model in economics suggested that it is also \npossible to specify the LAIDS as a state space model with TVPs. The specification of \nthe TVP-LAIDS is explored below.  \n2.1. Static LAIDS \nThe conventional static LAIDS model can be written in the following form: \nik\nk\nik\nj\nijijii vdum\nP\nx\npw ++\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb++= \u2211\u2211 \u03d5\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1\n*\nloglog      \n (i, j=1, 2, \u2026, n; k=1, 2, \u2026, m)   (1) \nwhere wi is the budget share of the ith good; pj is price of the jth good; x is total \nexpenditure on all goods in the system; P* is the Stone price index approximated by \n\u2211=\ni\nii pwP log*log ; x\/P* is real total expenditure; kdum  is a dummy variable, which \nhandles the intervention of the exogenous shock; vi is the normal disturbance term, \n),0(~ 2ii Nv \u03c3 ;  i\u03b1 , i\u03b2 , ij\u03b3  and ik\u03d5  are the parameters to be estimated. \nEquation (1) can be written more compactly in the vector-matrix notation: \ntttt vdumzw ++= \u03d5\u03a0      (2) \nwhere tz  is a q-vector of intercept, log prices and log real total expenditure variables \n( 2+= nq ); \u03a0  and \u03d5  are )( qn\u00d7  and mn\u00d7 parameter matrices, respectively; \u03a0  \n= )...,( ,21 \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 n\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 , where i\u03c0   is a q-vector.  \nTo comply with the properties of demand theory, some restrictions are imposed on \nthe parameters in Equation (1), such as Adding-up (\u2211 =\ni\ni 1\u03b1 , \u2211 =\ni\nij 0\u03b3 , 0=\u2211\ni\ni\u03b2  \nand 0=\u2211\ni\nik\u03d5 ), Homogeneity ( \u2211 =\nj\nij 0\u03b3 ) and Symmetry ( jiij \u03b3\u03b3 = ). To examine \nthese restrictions, the following sample-size-corrected statistic is employed in this \nstudy (Baldwin et al, 1983; Chambers, 1990): \n \n))(1\/()(\n\/)()(\n1\n1\n1\nqNntr\ngtr\nT\nUR\nURR\n\u2212\u2212\u039b\u039b\n\u039b\u2212\u039b\u039b\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n                                      (3) \nwhere tr stands for the trace; R\u039b  and U\u039b  are the estimated residual covariance \nmatrices with and without restrictions imposed, respectively; N is the number of \nobservations; g is the number of the restrictions. T1 is approximately distributed as \n) ,( qNgF \u2212  under the null hypothesis. \nWithin the LAIDS framework, the demand elasticities can be calculated as: the \nexpenditure elasticity iiix w\/1 \u03b2\u03b5 += , the uncompensated price elasticity \nijiiijijij www \/\/ \u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b5 \u2212+\u2212=  and the compensated price elasticity \njiijijij ww ++\u2212= \/\n* \u03b3\u03b4\u03b5  ( ij\u03b4 =1 for i=j; ij\u03b4 =0 for i\u2260j). These elasticities derived from \nthe LAIDS have been proved to be sound approximations to the \u201ctrue\u201d AIDS \nelasticities (Alston et al, 1994; Buse, 1994; Green and Alston, 1990). \nThe static LAIDS, also known as the long-run LAIDS, implicitly assumes that \nconsumers\u2019 behaviour is always \u201cin equilibrium\u201d. However, many factors such as \n 4 \nhabit persistence, imperfect information and incorrect expectations often cause \nconsumers to be \u201cout of equilibrium\u201d until full adjustments take place (Anderson and \nBlundell, 1983). Therefore, the assumption of the static LAIDS is unrealistic. \nMoreover, no attention is paid to the statistical properties of the variables in the static \nLAIDS, and the presence of unit roots may invalidate the asymptotic distribution of \nthe estimators. In addition, the static LAIDS is unlikely to general accurate short-run \nforecasts due to lack of short-run dynamics (Chambers and Nowman, 1997).  \n2.2. Error Correction LAIDS \nTo overcome the above problems involved in the static LAIDS, the concept of \ncointegration was introduced and consequently the dynamic version, EC-LAIDS, was \ndeveloped. Following Engle and Granger\u2019s two-stage approach, the EC-LAIDS can \nbe written in the following form (Edgerton et al, 1996; Chambers and Nowman, 1997; \nDuffy, 2002):  \nttttttt vdumzwdumLzLBwLA +\u2212\u2212++= \u2212\u2212\u2212 )()()()( 111 \u03d5\u03a0\u0393\u2206\u03c6\u2206\u2206   (4) \nwhere \u2211 =+=\nl\ni\ni\niLAILA 1)( , \u2211 ==\nm\ni\ni\niLBLB 0)(  and \u2211 ==\ns\ni\ni\niLL 0)( \u03c6\u03c6  are matrix \npolynomials in the lag operator L. l and m can be determined by using order \nselection techniques. Given that annual data are used, most tourism demand studies \nemploying error correction models have shown that setting the lag length of \ndifferenced variables equal to zero is appropriate. Therefore, Equation (4) can be \nreduced to the following form (see Durbarry and Sinclair, 2003): \nttttttt vdumzwdumzBw +\u2212\u2212++= \u2212\u2212\u2212 )( 111 \u03d5\u03a0\u0393\u2206\u03c6\u2206\u2206    (5) \nwhere B is an )( qn\u00d7  matrix; \u03c6  is an )( mn\u00d7  matrix; \u0393  is an )( nn\u00d7 matrix. \nConsidering degrees of freedom and statistical significance of the estimates of the \nerror correction terms, some empirical studies, such as Ray (1985) and Blanciforti et \nal (1986), use a more restrictive formulation, involving only the disequilibrium in the \nown budget share in each equation. In other words, \u0393  becomes diagonal, and the off-\ndiagonal terms, the estimates of which are normally insignificant, are restricted to \nzero.  This restricted specification is also employed in this paper due to the limited \nnumber of observations available. The diagonal form of \u0393  also implies that ii\u0393  are \nequal, i.e., \u0393  is a negative scalar. This restriction can be tested using the above 1T  \nstatistic. Consistent with the tests in the long-run model, the imposition of \nhomogeneity and symmetry restrictions on the short-run parameters (B) can be tested \nstatistically, although they do not necessarily hold in the short term.  \nEquation (5) reflects both long-run and short-run effects in a single model. In the \nshort run, changes in expenditure shares depend on changes in prices, real \nexpenditure, dummies, and the disequilibrium error in the previous period. In the long \nrun, when all differenced terms become zero, Equation (5) is reduced to Equation (2), \ni.e., the system achieves its steady state. Both the static\/long-run and EC-LAIDS \nmodels can be estimated using Zellner\u2019s (1962) seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) \nprocedure.  \n2.3. TVP LAIDS \nOne of the assumptions behind traditional econometric techniques is that \ncoefficients are constant over time. This implies that the economic structure \n 5 \ngenerating the data does not change (Judge et al., 1985). However, \u201ca long period of \nhigh inflation or a rate of inflation above a certain threshold, for instance, may cause a \nstructural change in the way firms and consumers form their expectations\u201d (Tucci, \n1995, pp239). As the modifications of the environment are transitory or ambiguous in \nsome situations, the changes in the coefficients may follow a stochastic process \n(Lucas, 1976). Since \u201cmodels with parameters following a non-stationary stochastic \nprocess are able to accommodate fairly fundamental structural changes\u201d (Tucci, 1995, \np253), even if the justification for a structural change is not strong, a safer way \nforward, would be to use the TVP approach to deal with potential structural \ninstabilities. In addition, model specification errors, nonlinearities, proxy variables \nand aggregation are all sources of parameter variations (Belsley, 1973; Belsley and \nKuh, 1973; Cooley and Prescott, 1976; Sarris, 1973). Therefore, it is necessary to \ndevelop sophisticated and flexible econometric methodologies such as TVP models, \nwhich allow us to understand and forecast consumer behaviour more accurately. \n2.3.1. TVP-LR-LAIDS \nRelaxing the fixed parameter restriction, the unrestricted long-run LAIDS in \nEquation (2) can be re-written as a TVP system, i.e. TVP-LR-LAIDS. It should be \nnoted that since the estimates of fixed-parameter LAIDS in the empirical study of this \npaper have shown the statistical significance of dummy variables, they are also \nincluded in TVP formulations, but as exogenous variables they have fixed parameters. \nSuch treatment is suggested by Ramajo (2001). Each equation of the system can be \nwritten in the following one-dimension state space form: \nittiittit udumzw ++\u2032= \u03d1\u03c0  ),,0(~ tit HNu  Tt ,...,1=   (6) \nititit \u03be\u03c0\u03c0 +=+1  ),(~ 111 PcN\u03c0 , ),0(~ tit QN\u03be   (7) \nwhere itw  and itu  are the ith elements of tw  and tu  respectively; i\u03d1  is the ith row of \n\u03d1 ; it\u03be  is a q-vector of disturbance terms. it\u03c0  is an unobserved state vector, and \nfollows a multivariate random walk. The matrices tH  and tQ are initially assumed to \nbe known. \nCorrespondingly, the whole system can be specified as: \nttttt udum\u03a0zw ++= \u03d1\n**       (8) \n***\n1 ttt \u03be\u03a0\u03a0 +=+       (9) \nwhere ,* tnt zIz \u2032\u2297=  ),...,( 2,1\n* \u2032= ntttt \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03a0  and .),...,,( 21\n* \u2032= ntttt \u03be\u03be\u03be\u03be  \nIn homogeneity or symmetry restricted LAIDS, the restrictions (M), which are \nlinear, can be written as:  \n*\ntGM \u03a0=         (10) \nwhere G is the coefficient matrix of the restriction. \nCombining linear restrictions Equation (10) with Equation (8) gives a new \naugmented measurement equation in the form:  \nttttt UDZW ++=\n**\u03a0       (11) \n 6 \nwhere \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\nM\nw\nW\nt\nt ; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\nG\nz\nZ tt\n*\n* ; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n0\nt\nt\ndum\nD\n\u03d1\n; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n0\nt\nt\nu\nU . \n2.3.2. TVP-EC-LAIDS \nConventional econometrics suggests that once the long-run cointegration \nrelationship is identified, an error correction model can be established to reflect the \nshort-term adjustment. The specification of the conventional fixed-parameter EC \nmodels implies that the speed of short-run adjustment is constant over time. In the \nchanging environment resulting from the various reasons addressed earlier, this \nassumption seems to be too strict and arbitrary. In fact, \u201ceven assuming the existence \nof a stable long-run combination, one may find signs of instability in the short-run \nadjustment mechanism\u201d (Ramajo, 2001, pp771). Therefore, it is more easily \nunderstandable to specify TVP short-run dynamics within the long-run equilibrium \n(or cointegration) framework. The methodological description for this can be found in \nHarvey (1989, Chapter 6). The LAIDS incorporating this technique is termed \u201cTVP-\nEC-LAIDS\u201d in this present study.  The TVP-LR-LAIDS pays attention only to long-\nrun variations of demand and the influencing factors regardless of the existence of \ncointegration relationships, whereas the TVP-EC-LAIDS focuses on varying short-\nterm adjustment speeds towards the long-run steady state of demand. \nAs with Equations (6) and (7), each equation of the unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS \ncan be described as: \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u2206\u03b8\u03c0\u2206 ittiittit udumzw ++\u2032= )(       (12) \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03be\u03c0\u03c0 ititit +=+1       (13) \nwhere ),( 11 \u2032\u03a0\u2212\u2206= \u2212\u2212\n\u2206\ntttt zwzz ; \n\u2206\nit\u03c0 is the corresponding parameter vector; i\u03b8  is the \nith row of \u03b8 ; \u2206itu  is the ith item of \n\u2206\ntu , the disturbance vector of the measurement \nequation; \u2206it\u03be  is  the disturbance vector of the state equation. \nCorrespondingly, the state space form of the whole unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS is \nspecified as follows: \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u2206\u03b8\u03a0\u2206 ttttt udumzw ++\u2032= )(\n*      (14) \n*\n1\n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03be\u03a0\u03a0 ttt +=+       (15) \nwhere )(1\n* \u2032\u2297= \u2206+\n\u2206\ntqt zIz ; ),...,,( 21 \u2032=\n\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03a0 ntttt ; .),...,,( 21\n* \u2032= \u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206 ntttt \u03be\u03be\u03be\u03be  \nTo estimate the TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS models and generate the post \nsample forecasts, the Kalman filter algorithm can be employed (Harvey, 1989; Durbin \nand Koopman, 2001). Given the initial conditions on the hyper-parameter vector \n),( 111 Pc=\u03bd , the Kalman filter delivers the minimum-mean-square-error estimator of \nthe state vector as each new observation becomes available. After all T observations \nhave been processed, the optimal estimator of the current state vector, and\/or the state \nvector in the next time period, is achieved based on the full information set. Then the \nestimated state vector at time T+1 will be used to forecast the dependent variables at \nthe same point of time. Following this procedure, multiple-step forecasts can be \ngenerated. Since the parameters are refined recursively through the use of the Kalman \nfilter algorithm, given the same dataset, the TVP models are likely to generate more \n 7 \naccurate forecasts than the fixed-parameter models especially in the short run (Song et \nal, 2003).   \n2.3.3. Applications of TVP Models \nTVP long-run models have been successfully applied to economic studies, and \nrecently the TVP error correction model has attracted greater attention from \neconomists (Greenslade and Hall, 1996; Ramajo, 2001). However applications of the \nTVP model to tourism demand analysis are still rare, with only a few exceptions such \nas Riddington (1999), Song and Witt (2000), Song, Witt and Jensen (2003), Song and \nWong (2003). Where the ex post forecasting performance of tourism demand is \nconcerned, the TVP model has outperformed most of its competitors, especially in the \nshort run. \nAs yet there has been no published work on estimation or predictive tests of TVP-\nLR-LAIDS or TVP-EC-LAIDS. The only exploratory study with TVP methodology \non demand systems is by Doran and Rambaldi (1997), who demonstrated the \nestimation of a demand system (other than AIDS) with linear time-varying \nconstraints, using the augmented state-space model. However, the forecasting \nperformance of the TVP demand system was not examined. This present paper will \nbridge the gap by estimating both TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS, and \ncomparing their forecast accuracy with the fixed-parameter counterparts. \n3. Empirical Results \n3.1. The Data \nThe empirical study in this paper is conducted by examining the demand for \ntourism to Western Europe by UK residents. Twenty-two destinations are included: \nAustria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, \nIceland, Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, \nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and former Yugoslavia. Within the researched \narea, Spain, France, Greece, Italy and Portugal are the major destinations, and tourist \nspending in these five destinations accounted for 68.6% of the total in the twenty-two \nWestern European countries in 2000. This study, therefore, focuses on these five \ndestinations, with the other seventeen aggregated to a single group as Others. Each of \nthe six destination countries\/group is regarded as an aggregated tourism product, \npurchased by UK visitors. \nTourism prices employed here are effective prices, measured by the ratio of the \nconsumer price index in each destination to the consumer price index in the UK, \nadjusted by the exchange rate. The aggregated price for the Others group takes the \nform of Stone\u2019s price index. All the prices are normalised to unity at the point of the \nbase year (1995). Total expenditure refers to the tourist spending covering all these \ndestinations, and spending per capita is calculated to take account of the effect of \nchanges in the population size over time. In addition, three dummies are introduced to \naccount for the effects of the first oil crisis (1974-1975), the second oil crisis (1979) \nand the Gulf War (1990-1991), respectively. The values are set as 1 during the periods \nthese events occurred and 0 at other times.  \nIn this empirical study, a three-stage budgeting process is followed. It is assumed \nthat tourists first allocate their consumption expenditure between total tourism \n 8 \nconsumption and consumption of other goods and services. In the second stage, \ntourists allocate their tourism expenditure between Western Europe and other \ndestinations. In the last stage, tourists make their decisions among the alternative \ndestinations in Western Europe. The LAIDS models are applied to the last stage of the \ntourism expenditure allocation. Since the goods and services correspond to broad \naggregated categories of international tourism, the separability assumption of the \ndemand system is plausible (Pollak and Wales, 1992, pp36). In such a conditional \ndemand system, the demand for each destination depends on the total expenditure in \nthe whole region and the prices of the destinations within this region.  \nThe data on prices, exchange rates and population are collected from the \nInternational Financial Statistics Yearbook (International Monetary Fund, various \nissues), and the expenditure data are collected from Travel Trends (UK National \nStatistics, various issues). The data are annual and cover the period 1972-2000. \n3.2. Model Estimation  \nEstimation of the various LAIDS models and the relevant statistical tests are \nconducted using the computing package Eviews 4.0. The augmented Dickey-Fuller  \n(ADF) test for unit roots suggests that all the variables in Equation (1) are I(1), and \nthe CI relationships cannot be rejected by the Engle-Granger approach at the 5% \nsignificance level in any case.\n1\n Therefore, the fixed-parameter unrestricted static\/long-\nrun LAIDS model (Equation 2) is estimated using the iterative SUR method. The \nresult is shown in Table 1. With regard to the dynamic LAIDS, the Engle-Granger \ntwo-step approach is used to estimate the cointegration regression. The residuals from \nthe cointegration regression are then calculated and incorporated into Equation (5). \nThe estimates of the unrestricted fixed-parameter EC-LAIDS are shown in Table 2.\n2\n \nEstimates of both LAIDS models suggest that the one-off events, especially the Gulf \nWar, display significant impacts on tourism demand in some cases. \nWith theoretical restrictions imposed on the parameters of LAIDS models, \nhomogeneity-restricted and homogeneity-and-symmetry-restricted fixed-parameter \nlong-run and EC-LAIDS models are estimated. The statistic T1 (see Table 3) suggests \nthat the symmetry restrictions cannot be satisfied in the static specifications, but the \ndynamic EC-LAIDS passes both homogeneity and symmetry tests at the 5% \nsignificance level and the joint test at a lower (1%) level. Therefore, the specifications \nwith both long-run and short-run effects taken into account are more appropriate in \nterms of consistency with economic theory. The estimates of both fixed-parameter \nhomogeneous and symmetric long-run LAIDS and EC-LAIDS are reported in Tables \n4 and 5, respectively, and will be further considered in the subsequent forecasting \ncomparison. \nTable 1   \n                                                           \n1\n Being bounded between 0 and 1, budget shares cannot really be I(1), but the ADF test results do \nindicate non-stationarity in the finite sample period. The results of the ADF tests are not presented due \nto space constraints, but are available from the authors upon request. \n2\n The estimates reported in Table 2 as well as in Table 4 refer to the models without the equal ii\u0393  \nconstraint, although the statistics of T1 (2.10 and 3.69, respectively) suggests that the null hypothesis \ncannot be rejected at the 5% significance level. The major consideration is consistency and \ncomparability with the TVP counterparts. This cross-equation constraint requires simultaneous \nestimation of the whole system, while it is not achievable for the TVP LAIDS models in this study.  In \norder to provide an objective judgement of the competing models\u2019 forecasting performance, a \nconsistent specification has to be applied. \n 9 \nEstimates of the long-run parameters in the unrestricted fixed-parameter long-run \nLAIDS  \n France Greece Italy Portugal Spain \nlog 1p  \n0.023 \n(0.066) \n-0.031 \n(0.060) \n0.049 \n(0.037) \n-0.054 \n(0.030) \n0.055 \n(0.103) \nlog 2p  \n-0.044 \n(0.047) \n-0.133** \n(0.042) \n0.064* \n(0.026) \n0.003 \n(0.021) \n-0.020 \n(0.073) \nlog 3p  \n-0.157** \n(0.025) \n-0.053* \n(0.023) \n-0.014 \n(0.014) \n0.047** \n(0.011) \n0.114** \n(0.039) \nlog 4p  \n0.079 \n(0.041) \n-0.019 \n(0.037) \n-0.030 \n(0.023) \n-0.022 \n(0.019) \n-0.068 \n(0.065) \nlog 5p  \n0.163** \n(0.032) \n0.108** \n(0.056) \n-0.051** \n(0.018) \n0.039** \n(0.015) \n-0.245** \n(0.050) \nlog 6p  \n-0.167** \n(0.062) \n0.099* \n(0.056) \n-0.065 \n(0.035) \n0.009 \n(0.028) \n0.293** \n(0.096) \n)\/log( *Px  \n0.008* \n(0.003) \n0.005 \n(0.003) \n-0.009** \n(0.002) \n0.006** \n(0.002) \n0.028** \n(0.005) \n2R  0.898 0.747 0.800 0.815 0.570 \nS.E. 0.010 0.009 0.006 0.005 0.016 \nDW 2.568 1.480 2.367 2.046 2.487 \nNotes: * and ** refer to 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively.

Due to an \ninsufficient number of observations being available for this study, simultaneous \nestimation of the whole system using the Kalman filter is not possible, and therefore \nestimation of the homogeneity-and-symmetry-restricted TVP-LAIDS models is \nbeyond the context of this paper.  However, with no restriction put on the parameters, \nit is feasible and valid to estimate the unrestricted TVP-LAIDS models equation by \nequation (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980).

During that \nperiod of time, expenditure elasticities for France, Italy and Spain underwent sharp \nincreases, while the opposite situation is shown in Portugal. By contrast, since the \nmid 1980s the variations have become relatively mild. In the case of Greece, \nexpenditure elasticities have been declining gradually throughout the whole \nobservation period. On the other hand, the expenditure elasticity for Spain has \nexperienced the most obvious fluctuations.  Dritsakis (2004) found the same \nevidence when he examined the demand for Greek tourism by UK residents. In the \ncase of Spain, after experiencing large variations before the 1990s, UK residents\u2019 \npreferences have become relatively stable over the last decade. With respect to own-\nprice elasticities (see Fig. 2), in a similar manner to expenditure elasticities, \nrelatively large upturns or downturns took place in the early 1980s. These \nphenomena were associated with the global economic recession during this period. \nEither similar or opposite changing trends reflected the interrelationships between \nthese destinations (substitutes or complements). Since the mid 1980s, gradual \nevolutions of own-price elasticities have been observed in France, Greece and Italy. \nPortugal and Spain, however, still exhibited large variations, with the influence of \nthe Gulf War in the early 1990s being evident. \n3.3. Comparisons of Forecasting Performance \nAlthough the TVP-LAIDS allows one to examine the time varying characteristics \nof the coefficients in the demand model, the reasons why the parameters in the \ndemand model vary over time in different manners remains unclear. However, the \nmost important contribution of the TVP technique to econometrics is its ability to \ngenerate accurate forecasts. The forecasting performance of the TVP-LAIDS \nmodels, compared with the fixed-parameter counterparts, is a further concern of this \nstudy. Various fixed-parameter and TVP LAIDS models, in both long-run and error-\ncorrection forms, with and without restrictions, are included in the forecasting \nassessment, with the conventional unrestricted fixed-parameter long-run LAIDS \nbeing used as the benchmark. All of these models are re-estimated using the data up \nto 1996 and the observations over 1997-2000 are used to measure the one-year- to \nfour-years-ahead forecasting accuracy. Forecasting errors for both itw  and itw\u2206  are \ncalculated in each model in order to examine these models\u2019 abilities to forecast \ntourism demand (in terms of the expenditure share) levels and changes against the \nprevious period. The error measures used for the forecasting comparison are the \nmean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square percentage error \n(RMSPE) for demand levels, and MAE and RMSE for demand changes (see Witt \nand Witt 1992, Chapter 6 for justification).  \nThe forecast results (see Table 8) suggest that in 90% of cases the TVP versions of \nthe LAIDS models generate more accurate forecasts than their FP counterparts. The \ncomparison between each pair of the EC-LAIDS and long-run LAIDS models shows \nthat the former generally yields more accurate forecasts than the latter, with the only \nexception being the comparison between the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS and \nunrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS in terms of demand level forecasts. The superior \nperformance of the EC-LAIDS is particularly evident when demand change \nforecasting is concerned, as all EC-LAIDS models are ranked ahead of the static\/long-\nrun LAIDS. This is reasonable since incorporating the error correction mechanism \ninto the LAIDS specification contributes to capturing better the short-term demand \n 17 \nvariations. Comparing the overall performance with the benchmark unrestricted fixed-\nparameter long-run LAIDS, all of the specific LAIDS models except the \nhomogeneity-and-symmetry-restricted fixed-parameter long-run LAIDS show \nimproved forecasting accuracy, irrespective of whether demand levels or demand \nchanges are being forecast. The poor performance of the homogeneity-and-symmetry-\nrestricted fixed-parameter long-run LAIDS is associated with its misspecification, \nindicated by the failures of restriction tests. The overall evaluation across all models \nsuggests, with regard to forecasting demand levels, the TVP version models (the \nunrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS and the unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS) outperform all \nthe other fixed-parameter counterparts, with 28.2% (or 20.7%) and 23.3% (or 20.0%) \nimprovements of forecasting accuracy measured by RSMPE (or MAPE) being \nachieved, respectively, relative to the benchmark.  \nAs far as demand changes are concerned, fixed-parameter homogeneous and \nsymmetric EC-LAIDS performs the best in general, followed by the unrestricted \nTVP-EC-LAIDS. The superior performance of the homogeneity-and-symmetry-\nrestricted fixed-parameter EC-LAIDS indicates that with appropriate theoretical \nrestrictions imposed on the correctly specified model (incorporating the error \ncorrection mechanism), the forecasting ability of LAIDS is very likely to be \nimproved. The TVP version of the homogeneous and symmetric EC-LAIDS is not \navailable in this study, but examination of its forecasting performance certainly would \nbe of interest of future research. Without considering short-run adjustments, the other \nTVP-LAIDS, the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS, does not outperform any EC-LAIDS \nwhen forecasting demand changes, but appears to be the best amongst all three long-\nrun LAIDS. Compared to the benchmark, the homogeneity-and-symmetry-restricted \nfixed-parameter EC-LAIDS and the unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS show the most \nsignificant improvements in overall forecasting accuracy, reducing forecast errors by \n60.7% (or 54.7%) and 53.5% (or 49.8%) respectively, in terms of the MAE (or \nRSME). \nWhen different forecasting horizons are considered, more insights can be noted.  In \nterms of demand level forecasts, the homogeneity-and-symmetry-restricted fixed-\nparameter EC-LAIDS is ranked top over the one-year-ahead time horizon, followed \nby TVP-EC-LAIDS. The relatively low rank of the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS \nresults from its poor performance in the Portugal equation, although its performance \nin other equations is satisfactory. As the time horizon increases, the superiority of the \nunrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS increases considerably and consistently, being ranked \ntop in the two-years- and three-years-ahead forecasts and second in the four-years-\nahead forecasts. The performance of the unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS appears more \nstable, always being ranked second or third. The unrestricted fixed-parameter EC-\nLAIDS also shows its outstanding performance in the four-years-ahead case. The \nimprovements in forecast accuracy of the two TVP-LAIDS models relative to the \nbenchmark can be seen throughout all horizons, with only one exception. The most \nremarkable improvement is seen in the one-year-ahead forecast, where the \nunrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS and unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS generate 47.9% (or \n40.1%) and 38.7% (or 29.1%) more accurate results, respectively, measured by \nRMSPE (or MAPE). \n \n 18 \nTable 8  \nComparisons of forecasting accuracy of various LAIDS models over different forecasting horizons \nHorizon Measure U-FP-LR-LAIDS U-TVP-LR-LAIDS U-FP-EC-LAIDS U-TVP-EC-LAIDS H&S-FP-LR-LAIDS H&S-FP-EC-LAIDS \n1 year  MAPE 0.103  (5) 0.079  (4) 0.063  (3) 0.061  (2) 0.146  (6) 0.058  (1) \n RSMPE 0.163  (5) 0.108  (4) 0.090  (3) 0.085  (2) 0.178  (6) 0.082  (1) \n2 years  MAPE 0.120  (5) 0.091  (1) 0.114  (4) 0.103  (2) 0.175  (6) 0.107  (3) \n RSMPE 0.199  (5) 0.131  (1) 0.163  (4) 0.150  (2) 0.213  (6) 0.151  (3) \n3 years  MAPE 0.128  (3) 0.119  (1) 0.166  (5) 0.124  (2) 0.168  (6) 0.134  (4) \n RSMPE 0.170  (3) 0.143  (1) 0.215  (6) 0.165  (2) 0.190  (5) 0.173  (4) \n4 years  MAPE 0.207  (5) 0.156  (2) 0.118  (1) 0.161  (3) 0.216  (6) 0.178  (4) \n RSMPE 0.261  (6) 0.186  (2) 0.142  (1) 0.197  (3) 0.245  (5) 0.212  (4) \nOverall MAPE 0.140  (5) 0.111  (1) 0.115  (3) 0.112  (2) 0.176  (6) 0.119  (4) \n RSMPE 0.202  (5) 0.145  (1) 0.159  (3) 0.155  (2) 0.208  (6) 0.162  (4) \n1 year  MAE 7.427  (5) 6.536  (4) 5.208  (3) 4.908  (1) 14.166 (6) 5.008  (2) \n RSME 10.021 (5) 8.122  (4) 6.236  (2) 6.019  (1) 15.725 (6) 6.588  (3) \n2 years  MAE 7.460  (6) 7.137  (5) 5.306  (3) 4.372  (2) 63924  (4) 3.837  (1) \n RSME 9.210  (6) 8.866  (5) 6.310  (3) 5.855  (2) 7.781  (4) 5.110  (1) \n3 years  MAE 7.995  (5) 8.930  (6) 5.121  (3) 2.389  (2) 7.039  (4) 1.801  (1) \n RSME 9.897  (5) 10.359 (6) 6.029  (3) 2.915  (2) 7.782  (4) 2.205  (1) \n4 years  MAE 8.890  (6) 8.183  (5) 3.426  (3) 3.115  (2) 5.900  (4) 1.850  (1) \n RSME 10.287 (6) 9.960  (5) 4.479  (3) 4.360  (2) 5.912  (4) 2.367  (1) \nOverall MAE 7.943  (5) 7.696  (4) 4.765  (3) 3.696  (2) 8.507  (6) 3.124  (1) \n RSME 9.862  (5) 9.369  (4) 5.812  (3) 4.950  (2) 10.063 (6) 4.471  (1) \nNotes: The upper half of the table refers to the forecasts of levels variables, and the lower to differenced variables.

Summary and Conclusions \nIn this study, various LAIDS models have been compared in terms of model specifications \nand forecasting performance, using data on the demand for Western European tourism by UK \nresidents. The theoretical restriction tests suggest that the dynamic LAIDS incorporating the \nerror correction mechanism is the most appropriate functional form. The Kalman filter \nestimates of the TVP-LAIDS models provide a clear illustration of the evolution of demand \nelasticities over time. The superiority of the TVP-LAIDS models\u2019 performance is observed, \nfor the present set of data, in terms of the improvement of forecasting accuracy compared \nwith the conventional unrestricted fixed-parameter long-run LAIDS, especially in the short \nterm.  \nThe forecasting assessment shows that the introduction of TVPs into the LAIDS has \ngreatly improved the forecasting performance. Both the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS and the \nTVP-EC-LAIDS outperform the other FP competitors according to one-year- to four-years-\nahead forecasting in terms of demand levels. The unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS also shows \nimproved forecasting performance in terms of demand changes. In addition, incorporating the \nshort-run adjustment mechanism into the LAIDS can increase forecasting accuracy, especially \nwhen demand change forecasting is concerned.  \nThe empirical results in this paper support those of previous tourism demand studies which \nhave also employed TVP models (Riddington, 1999; Song et al, 2003; Song and Witt, 2000). \nSo far TVP models have generally performed well in modelling and forecasting tourism \ndemand. Its further combinations with other advanced econometric approaches should be \nconsidered for applications in this field. \nDue to a lack of sufficient observations available for this study, a complete illustration of \nthe superiority of the TVP-LAIDS models under theoretical restrictions has not been possible. \nSince this study has shown the superior forecasting performance of the homogeneity-and-\nsymmetry-restricted fixed-parameter EC-LAIDS, the predictive ability of its TVP counterpart \nremains an area for further investigation. \n \n 20 \nReferences \nAlston, J.
