This child is\neither a shared child of the couple or it comes from a previous partnership of one of the\npartners. Data from the German \u201cFertility and Family Survey\u201d (FFS) is used to estimate\npiecewise-linear log-hazard models for having another child. Time starts at partnership\nformation for stepfamilies, and at the birth of the previous child for couples with a\nshared child. These different measurements of time are accounted for in the model by\nusing two different clocks. The estimated parameters are used to calculate the estimated\nprobabilities for having a second or a third child within a certain time period. The\nresults show that birth rates of stepfamilies and of couples with only shared children are\nnot proportional. The differences between the estimated probabilities of having another\nchild tend to be largest for short durations; for longer durations some the differences in\nspeed balance out each other. One way to interpret the findings of the study is that\nstepfamilies and families with only shared children may differ in their wish to have a\nchild, but that these differences diminish over time.\n                                                          \n1 London School of Economics, Department of Sociology, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, Great\nBritain.

Introduction\nThe present paper discusses modelling issues concerning the comparison of\nchildbearing behaviour of stepfamilies and families with no children from earlier\npartners. The predominantly methodological question is discussed using the example of\nEast and West Germany.\nIn recent years the rise in the number of stepfamilies in most Western countries has\nincreased the interest in this family form (Hobcraft and Kiernan 1995). In West\nGermany four percent of all children are stepchildren while this is true for ten percent\nof all children in East Germany (Bien, Hartl and Teubner 2001). Stepfamilies are often\ndescribed as having special problems, resulting in a lower stability of stepfamilies\ncompared to families without stepchildren (Friedl 1988, Ganong and Coleman 1994,\nWalper 1993).\nThe problems of stepfamilies result from a number of factors, for example from\nthe multiple tensions experienced in stepfamilies, the special developmental tasks\nrequired in these families, and the lack of role definitions for parents and children in\nstepfamilies (Friedl 1988, Furstenberg 1987, Nave-Herz 1994, Walper 1993). One way\nof strengthening the cohesion of the new family is to have another child. The new child\ncan bind all the different family members together and thereby counterbalance their\ndisparate interests and needs. One could, therefore, assume a high probability for a first\ncommon child in stepfamilies.\nMany couples do, however, abstain from having a common child. The parents may\nfear that a new child may cause additional tensions in the family. Furthermore, at least\none partner in a stepfamily has experienced a family break-up and may be sceptical\nabout having another child. Finally, financial considerations, or related considerations\nabout housing or employment, may also deter the couple from having another child.\nThe present paper analyses stepfamily fertility in East and West Germany focusing\non the impact of children from earlier partners. Fertility decisions in stepfamilies differ\nfrom the patterns observed for childless partnerships because the two partners have\nseparate fertility histories and often are at different stages of the parenting processes.\nThey may have a different number of children, children at very different ages, or one of\nthem may not yet be a parent at all.\nStudies of stepfamily fertility have used the value-of-children approach to derive\nhypotheses about birth rates (Blake 1979, Griffith, Koo and Suchindran 1985, Vikat,\nThomson and Hoem 1999). A key hypothesis assumes that first childbirth in a\npartnership reflects two potential social functions of the first child: it confirms the union\n(union-confirmation hypothesis) and it confers the status of a parent if one of the\npartners is not yet a parent (parenthood hypothesis). If the union-confirmation\nhypothesis is true, then, ceteris paribus, couples without a shared child should have a\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 309\nhigher birth rate than couples with a shared child. According to the parenthood\nhypothesis one expects, ceteris paribus, a higher birth rate if one partner has not yet a\nchild of his or her own compared to a situation where both partners are already parents.\nCouples have a second child to provide a sibling for the first child (sibling hypothesis).\nIn stepfamilies any shared child of the couple has at least one half-sibling. Whether the\nhalf-sibling can fully take the role of an older sibling should depend on the frequency of\ncontact between the children as well as on the age gap between them.\nThe main interest of the present paper is to obtain a valid model for comparing\nchildbearing behaviour of stepfamilies and families with no children from earlier\npartners. It turns out that the ceteris-paribus conditions from the previous paragraph are\ndifficult to translate into a statistical model. In a recent paper Thomson and colleagues\ncharacterised the situation of the couple by the total number of children of both\npartners, both partners\u2019 ages, calendar time and duration since partnership formation or\nsince the birth of the previous shared child (Thomson et al. in press). The present paper\nelaborates and modifies this analysis. One problem of comparing childbirth in\nstepfamilies with childbirth to partners with only shared children is caused by the\ngenuine difference in the measure of time. While the risk for conception is assumed to\nstart at union formation for couples without a shared child it starts at the birth of the\nprevious shared child for couples who have already a shared child. The models assume\nproportional birth rates in the two situations. There is, however, no obvious argument\nwhy the two birth rates should be proportional. The assumption can be tested by giving\nup the proportionality assumption of birth rates for couples with and without a shared\nchild. Instead separate baseline hazard rates are estimated for different patterns of\nparenthood. The estimation results show that the shape of the birth rates differ\nconsiderably between couples with and without a child from an earlier partnership.\nThe models presented in Thomson and colleagues\u2019 paper (Thomson et al. in press)\nallow testing directly the hypotheses derived from the value-of-children approach.\nGiving up the proportionality assumption means that these hypotheses cannot be tested\ndirectly any more. Instead I suggest an indirect method for evaluating the hypotheses.\nThe estimated model parameters are used to calculate estimated probabilities of\nchildbirth for various durations and covariate combinations. These estimated\nprobabilities can depict the differences between childbearing behaviour of families with\nand without children from earlier partnerships as they are predicted by the model.\nTo simplify the following exposition, couples with only shared children will be\ncalled \u201corthodox families\u201d for the rest of the paper. In section 2 earlier studies of\nstepfamily fertility are reviewed from a methodological perspective. In section 3 a\nmodified and less restrictive model is presented and discussed. The formula for the\nestimated event probability in piecewise-linear log-hazard rate models is derived in\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n310 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nsection 3.2. The data set and the variables are described in section 4. Section 5 gives the\nresults for the German data. Conclusions are presented in section 6.\n2. Analyses of stepfamily fertility\nEarly studies of childbirth after remarriage have compared the average number of\nchildren of women in stable partnerships with that of women who had experienced a\npartnership breakdown.(Note 1) Divorced, widowed, and re-married women were found\nto have fewer children at the end of their fertile ages than women who stayed in their\nfirst marriages. To understand these differences one needs to consider further\ncircumstances that typically differ between women in stable marriages and women who\nexperience partnership disruption. Consequently, later analyses of stepfamily fertility\nhave used multivariate models, i.e. hazard rate models.\nStudying women\u2019s fertility in a second marriage, Griffith, Koo and Suchindran\n(1985) estimated the effect of woman\u2019s prior child bearing, controlling for a number of\nother indicators. Using the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth they found that\nbirth rates were highest if the youngest child was below two years of age. \u201cIt appears\nthat having a new child is an important part of the process of creating a new family and\nthat many couples seek to begin this process quickly\u201d (ibid. p. 82). Griffith, Koo and\nSuchindran did not find a significant impact of the woman\u2019s number of children.\nIn another study of childbirth in women\u2019s second marriages, Wineberg (1990) used\nthe 1985 Current Population Survey. He found that women who had two or more\nchildren at remarriage had lower odds of having a child in the new marriage than\nwomen with zero or one child at remarriage. Wineberg interpreted this finding as\nsupport for the view that \u201ca child is needed to confirm adult status and complete one\u2019s\nfamily\u201d (ibid. p 37).\nJeffries, Berrington and Diamond (2000) have presented a study of childbearing\nafter marital dissolution using data about Britain. The analysed time period starts right\nat the end of women\u2019s first marriage; that is both times in and outside of partnerships\nare included. The findings are similar to those of Griffith and colleagues. Women with a\nchild under age five are more likely to have another baby, while parity at marital\ndissolution has only a small impact on the birth rate.\nAll three studies, which have just been described, take only women\u2019s children\nfrom earlier partners into account. In a number of papers, Thomson has extended this\napproach by asking, what role men\u2019s children from earlier partners play for fertility\ndecisions. Including information about men\u2019s children from earlier partners should give\na more complete picture of couples\u2019 childbearing decisions. Thomson applies this idea\nby using the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) (Thomson\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 311\n1997). The paper addresses fertility decisions of all married couples and considers\ninformation about both partners\u2019 children from previous unions. In the 1987-88\ninterview of NSFH, both spouses give details about their children living in the\nhousehold and, if appropriate, about their children living elsewhere. Thomson presents\nmodels for conception during the period from six month after the first interview until up\nto six months after the second interview in 1992-94. She estimates rates for various\nconfigurations of his children, her children, and shared children, finding support for the\nunion-confirmation hypothesis, the parenthood hypothesis and the sibling hypothesis.\nDue to small numbers for some of the configurations, many differences are, however,\nnot significant.(Note 2)\nIn another study, Vikat, Thomson and Hoem (1999) have analysed fertility\npatterns in Swedish stepfamilies. They have estimated hazard rate models for the first\nbirth in the current union, for second and for third births in the current union, for\nlifetime first births and for lifetime second and third births. The results indicate that a\ncouple wants a shared child independently of either partner\u2019s parity at union formation.\nThe study provides no support for the parenthood hypothesis, as there was no difference\nin the rate of first shared birth according to whether the respondent was childless or not.\nBuber and Prskawetz (2000) estimated hazard-rate models for first births in second\nunions in Austria. They found support for the union-commitment hypothesis but no\nsupport for the parenthood hypothesis. Buber and Prskawetz distinguished between co-\nresident and non-resident children from earlier partnerships. In Austria, first-birth rates\nin a second union are predominantly influenced by children who live in the household\nwhile non-resident children have only a weak influence.\nMost studies discussed so far provide only partial insight into stepfamily fertility\nbecause they either study only specific partnerships, or they study only children of a\nspecific birth order. In a more recent study, Thomson and collaborators take again a\nmore general approach to stepfamily fertility and compare birth rates in stepfamilies\nwith birth rates of couples with only shared children (Thomson et al. in press). If the\nmodels include indicators for all relevant differences between the types of families, the\nremaining differences associated with child composition \u2013 his, her or their children \u2013\nshould inform us about the value of children. More precisely, the models include\nindicators that allow us to simultaneously test the union commitment, the parenthood\nand the sibling hypothesis. The paper includes analyses of stepfamily fertility in\nAustria, Finland, France and West Germany. The estimations are based on data from\nthe European Family and Fertility Surveys, which provide information about all\nchildren of respondent\u2019s present and earlier partners. The results show that birth rates\nare higher if one of the children in the family is a stepchild. In Austria and France\ncouples without a shared child have a higher birth risk especially when the women has\nnot yet an own child.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n312 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nHowever, the direct comparison of couples with and couples without a shared\nchild comes at a price. It consists of the difficulty of defining the start of the period\nwhen the couple is at risk of conceiving a child. Thomson and collaborators use the\nbirth date of the previous shared child as the starting point if the couple already has a\nshared child. Otherwise, the date of partnership formation is used. Problems associated\nwith this specification will be discussed further in section 3.1.\nAnother elaboration of stepfamily fertility models refers to the endogeneity of the\nnumber of children born in a stepfamily to the partnership process. Lower birth rates in\nstepfamilies may be related to the lower stability of this kind of partnerships. Thomson\nand collaborators (1999) have simultaneously estimated birth rates and several other\nevents in the partnership history, namely union dissolution, transforming a cohabiting\nunion into marriage, and whether the union was formed by cohabitation or by marriage.\nBy introducing terms for unobserved heterogeneity it was possible to test to what\ndegree selectivity processes have an impact on the estimated effect of pre-union parity\non the birth rate. The results showed only weak effects of unobserved heterogeneity.\nThe union commitment hypothesis of first births in stepfamilies is supported.\nFurthermore it was shown that the probability of childbirth is reduced if the youngest\nchild is more than three years old.\n3. Model\n3.1 Model specification\nThe present paper investigates birth rates in partnerships with children. Time starts at\nunion formation if the couple already has a child at this point in time, and it starts anew\nafter each childbirth within the union. The start of the partnership is the date of moving\ntogether or the marriage date, whichever occurred first.\nAs pointed out before, the genuine difference in process time in studies of first\nbirths and higher order births in a union could be problematic. In the paper by Thomson\nand collaborators (in press), time starts at union formation for first births in a union and\nat the birth of the previous child for second and higher order union births. In both cases\nprocess time ends at conception, that is nine months before the birth, or, if the couple\ndoes not have another child, at partnership break-up or interview, whichever occurs\nfirst.(Note 3) If the rates of first and of higher order birth in a union are proportional, a\ncommon baseline can be assumed and differences in birth rates can be estimated by\nusing appropriate covariates.\nFrom a substantive viewpoint, the proportional hazard assumption should be\ncorrect if childbirth and marriage mark in the same way the starting point of otherwise\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 313\nsimilar fertility processes. It assumes that the couples are in comparable stages of\ndecision making about having a(nother) child, and especially that they plan similar\nmoratoria of trying to conceive a(nother) child. These assumptions can be disputed.\nMoving together is for some couples the start of a period of togetherness that may or\nmay not lead to shared children at a later stage. Other couples start living together with\nthe explicit wish to form a family soon. In the latter case women are sometimes already\npregnant when the couple moves together. This is not possible for fertility processes\nthat start at childbirth.\nFigure 1a: Survival Function for the Birth of the Second Child; West-Germany\n0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0,8\n0,9\n1\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since begin of partnership or birth of first child\nOrthodox family\nStepfamily\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n314 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 1b: Survival Function for the Birth of the Second Child; East-Germany\nFigures 1a and 1b show survival functions for the birth of a second child for\npartnerships where the first child is a shared child or a non-shared child. For West\nGermany the second birth rates follow a specific pattern. Compared to orthodox\nfamilies, stepfamilies have higher rates of having a second child during the first one and\na half years. In the following three years, the birth rates are higher in orthodox families.\nIn East Germany, stepfamilies have a considerably higher birth rate in the first two and\na half years than orthodox families. By that time about 50 percent of all stepfamilies are\nestimated to have a second child compared to only 30 percent of all orthodox families.\nFor longer durations the gap between childbirth probabilities in orthodox and in\nstepfamilies decreases.\nThe different patterns suggest that for some couples partnership formation may be\nendogenous to the fertility process. The data set does, however, not provide the dates\nwhen the couples began dating, which would otherwise allow a more appropriate\nmeasurement of process time. Therefore, process time is measured as described above.\nIn the following the proportional hazard assumption for the two types of families is\ntested by estimating two alternative models: one model assuming proportionality and\nanother model which allows for different baseline birth rates of couples with a shared\nchild and for couples with only non-shared children. Especially for West-German men\nthe numbers for some of these family types are rather small. As a result the estimated\n0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0,8\n0,9\n1\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since partnership formation or first child birth\nOrthodox family\nStepfamily\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 315\nparameters have high standard errors, but the substantial differences in the baseline\nrates make the model specification still worthwhile. In all models a piecewise-linear\nlog-hazard rate is assumed (Lillard 1993). More precisely, the proportional hazard\nmodel can be written as\nLn \u03bb ( t | x ) = s\u0001 T ( t ) + \u03b3\u0001 X (1)\nwith s\n\u0001\nT ( t ) the baseline hazard and X the vector covariate values (Lillard and Panis\n2000). The non-proportional hazard model can be written as\nLn \u03bb ( t | x ) = s\u0001 T ( t ) + As\n\u0001\nT ( t ) (No shared child = 1) + \u03b3\u0001 X. (2)\nA more detailed formulation of the model can be found in section 4.4.\nA drawback of the non-proportional model specification is that the differences\nbetween stepfamilies and orthodox families are no longer captured by one or two\nspecific parameters. The non-proportional model does not provide a straightforward\nstatistical test for the partnership and the parenthood hypotheses. It is, however,\npossible to compute the estimated probability of having another child within a certain\ntime period based on the estimated model parameters. The probability associated with\nthe different types of parenthood experience will be used for assessing the hypotheses\nderived from the value-of-children approach. Section 3.2 describes the calculation of\nthe event probability for a piecewise-linear log-hazard rate model.\nThe consideration about endogeneity in section 2 could be implemented in the\nmodel by allowing for effects of unobserved heterogeneity. The study by Thomson et\nal. (1999) suggests that the effects are likely to be small. In addition, it is not desirable\nto further increase the complexity of the model because already now some estimates\nhave very high standard errors due to the small number of observations in some groups.\nUnder standard assumptions the parameters in model (1) and model (2) are\nordinary maximum likelihood estimators (Andersen et al. 1992). Especially, the\nassumption of As\n\u0001\n=0 can be tested with the likelihood-ratio test. As four additional\nparameters are estimated in model (2), the proportional hazard assumption for couples\nwith and without shared children is rejected at the five percent level if the likelihood\nincreases by 4.75 or more.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n316 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n3.2 The probability of having another child\nThe event probability can be calculated from the well-known relationship between the\nsurvivor probability S (t) and the hazard rate \u03bb(t):\n( )\u222b\u2212= t duutS\n0\n.)(exp)( \u03bb (3)\nThe model assumes that log\u03bb is a linear spline.

The effects of covariates enter the estimated probability through the yj-\nvalues. Constant covariates have only effects on y0. Formula (7) can be easily modified\nto estimate probabilities for values of time-constant or time-varying covariates. In the\nmodel presented below with nodes at 1, 2 and 5 years the slope parameters for families\nwith a shared child are s0, s1, s2 and s3. For families without a shared child they are\ncalculated as s0+ sA0, s1+ sA1, s2+ sA2 and s3+ sA3.\n4. Data set and Variables\n4.1 Data set\nThe empirical analyses are based on the German Family and Fertility Survey (FFS)\nfrom 1992. It has been carried out by the German Federal Institute for Population\nResearch (Pohl 1995).(Note 4) It comprises interviews with about 2000 men and 3000\nwomen both in East and West Germany, that is circa 10000 interviews altogether. The\nresponse rate was 74 percent. Most analyses in the paper use the retrospective\ninformation about partners and children. The partner history provides information about\nall partners with whom the respondent has cohabited before the interview. The survey\nalso provides the number of children each partner had prior to cohabiting with the\nrespondent. The respondent\u2019s child history gives information about all biological\nchildren of the respondent and of all stepchildren and adopted children who ever have\nlived with him or her in the same household.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n318 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nThe German FFS sample consists of respondents aged 20 to 39 at the interview.\nThis relatively young age is one of the reasons why a substantial number of respondents\nnever had lived with a partner by the time of the interview, and only about 10 percent of\nthe respondents had had more than one partner.(Note 5) For the analyses presented\nbelow all partnerships of a respondent are selected during the course of which the\ncouple had at least one child, whether shared or non-shared.\nThe comparison of fertility decisions in stepfamilies and orthodox families is\nbased on counting all biological children of both spouses towards the couple\u2019s total\nparity. Variations in the birth rate are studied by different child configurations within\nthe same total parity.(Note 6) Therefore, only periods in partnerships are selected when\nthe couple had a child \u2013 his, her or their child.\nIf the month of the beginning or the end of the partnership or of childbirth is\nmissing a value for the month has been imputed after inspection of related events. In\ncases where even the year was missing the partnership has been excluded from the\nanalysis. Furthermore, cases are excluded if the number of children of the partner is not\nknown. The East-German analyses are restricted to the time prior to January 1990 to\nguard potential changes in behaviour after the fall of the Berlin Wall. More details\nabout the sample selection are given in Appendix A. The selections result in samples of\n952 partnerships of West-German men, 1106 partnerships of East-German men, 1804\npartnerships of West-German women and 1958 partnerships of East-German women.\nThere are fewer observations for men than for women because the FFS sample for men\nis smaller and because of the higher age of men at partnership formation. The higher\nnumber of partnerships for East Germans reflects the younger ages at partnership\nformation.\nFor the multivariate analyses in this paper only couples with at least one child are\nselected. There is no restriction on the order of the partnership. The estimation of the\nhazard rate models will be based on 502 partnerships of West-German men, 1142\npartnerships of West-German women, 854 partnerships of East-German men and 1679\npartnerships of East-German women.\n4.2 Identifying non-shared children\nInformation about children has been taken from the respondents\u2019 child history, the\nhousehold composition at interview, and the question about whether the partner had\nchildren before the beginning of the partnership. In the child history each child is\nidentified either as own child, as adopted child, as stepchild, or as foster child. The\nsurvey has not collected information about the other biological parent of the child. It is\nassumed that the other biological parent of the child is the partner with whom the\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 319\nrespondent lived at the time of the birth of the child or with whom the respondent\nmoved together soon after the birth of the child.\nThis idea proves to be problematic in some cases as for example many East-\nGerman men reported that their spouse had a child before the beginning of the\npartnership but no stepchild could be identified from men\u2019s child histories and\nhousehold composition at interview. For some of these cases it is reasonable to assume\nthat the child was born before its parents had the opportunity to form an independent\nhousehold and, therefore, it may be regarded as a shared child. However, the FFS data\ndo not allow us to unambiguously determining whether respondent\u2019s children that are\nborn prior to the start of a partnership are shared children of these partners or\nrespondent\u2019s own children. (Note 7) The rules that are applied in the present study\nfollow those in Thomson et al. (in press). They are extended by requiring more\ninformation about the children that the partner brought into the household. The rules\nrefer to the so-called STARTDATE, which is the end date of the previous partnership or\none year before the start of the current partnership, whichever occurred last. The start of\nthe current partnership is either the date of moving together or the marriage date,\nwhichever occurred first. Three rules are applied to each partnership: (a) Any own child\nborn after STARTDATE is classified as a shared child of the couple. (b) Any child of the\nrespondent born before STARTDATE is classified as child of the respondent if either the\npartner did not bring any child into the partnership, or if the partner brought a child into\nthe partnership and this child can be identified as a different child in the child history.\n(c) Any child of the respondent born before STARTDATE is regarded as unclassifiable\nif the partner brought a child into the partnership which cannot be identified in the child\nhistory, or if it is not known whether the partner brought a child into the\npartnership.(Note 8) Partnerships for which a child could not be classified are excluded\nfrom the analyses (see Appendix A).\n4.3 Some partnership characteristics\nTables 1a and 1b compare some partnership characteristics in the four samples of West-\nGerman men, West-German women, East-German men and East-German women. By\nfar the most partnerships are first partnerships, in East Germany with 88 to 89 percent\nslightly more than in West Germany. The selected East-German couples are on average\nmore than one year younger than the West-German couples. In partnerships without\nstepchildren, male respondents have on average about 1.5 years younger partners while\nthe female respondents have on average partners who are nearly three years older than\nthe woman herself. At formation of a stepfamily both partners are on average\nconsiderably older than in partnerships with no child from an earlier relationship. In the\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n320 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nmale samples the age gap between partners in a stepfamily is smaller than in\npartnerships without a child from an earlier relationship. One can assume that this is\ndue to the upper age limit of age 39 in the FFS, which excludes men who form a\nstepfamily at higher ages. In the female samples the age gap between partners in\nstepfamilies is larger than in orthodox families.\nTable 1a: Order of partnership (percentage) and ages of partners at start of\npartnership (mean and (standard error))\nWest Men West\nWomen\nEast Men East\nWomen\n1st partnership 84.5 85.9 87.8 88.9\n2nd partnership 12.4 11.4 10.0 9.6\nHigher order 3.1 2.6 2.2 1.6\nTotal number partnerships (N=100%) 952 1804 1106 1958\nNo stepfamily: Respondent\u2019s age at start 23.8 (3.6) 22.1 (3.4) 22.7 (3.0) 20.6 (4.1)\nNo stepfamily: Partner\u2019s age at start 22.2 (3.6) 24.8 (4.4) 21.0 (2.7) 23.5 (2.3)\nStepfamily: Respondent\u2019s age at start 26.9 (5.6) 25.1 (5.2) 24.5 (4.1) 23.4 (3.7)\nStepfamily: Partner\u2019s age at start 25.8 (5.5) 30.0 (7.1) 23.3 (4.0) 27.1 (5.7)\nNote: Respondents\u2019 and partners\u2019 mean ages are based on slightly fewer cases due to missing partners\u2019 ages.\nTable 1b: Child composition at begin of partnership (12 months lag)\nWest Men West Women East Men East Women\nN % N % N % N %\nAny shared child 112 12 237 13 317 29 638 33\nOnly child(ren) of respondent 28 3 88 5 64 6 180 9\nOnly child(ren) of spouse 32 3 73 4 82 7 105 5\nChild of respondent & child of\nspouse, no shared\n12 1 18 1 45 4 85 4\nNo child\n  (Of which child later)\n768\n(318)\n81\n(33)\n1388\n(726)\n77\n(40)\n598\n(346)\n54\n(31)\n950\n(671)\n49\n(34)\nTotal number partnerships 952 100 1804 100 1106 100 1958 100\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 321\nTable 1b shows the child composition at the beginning of the partnership. In West\nGermany the share of partnerships that include children right from the start is\nconsiderably lower than in East Germany. Difficulties of young couples to find their\nown apartment as well as higher rates of single parenthood in East Germany explain\nthis pattern (Huinink and Wagner 1995, Schneider and Bien 1998). It is also possible\nthat high re-partnering rates of divorced parents in East Germany contribute to the East-\nWest differences in Table 1b. Rather few partnerships include non-shared children.\nEspecially West-German men report few stepchildren. Only 7 percent of their\npartnerships have a non-shared child compared to 10 percent of the partnerships of\nWest-German women, 17 percent of the partnerships of East-German men and 18\npercent of the partnerships of East-German women.(Note 9)\nThe statistical models will be estimated separately for the two countries and for\nmen and women. The information about couples has been obtained from the\nrespondents alone, and only for the respondents information about past partners has\nbeen collected. Because male respondents differ from the partners of the female\nrespondents, and vice versa, the male and the female samples are not merged for this\nanalysis. Some differences between the male and the female samples, which emerge for\nexample in Table 1a, provide some possible explanations for disparate outcomes of the\nmodel estimations between male and female samples.\n4.4 Covariates\nThe hypotheses about fertility in stepfamilies are tested by comparing the birth rates in\nstepfamilies with the birth rates of families with the same total number of children but\nwho are all born in the same partnership. Especially all periods in partnerships are\nexcluded during which the couple is childless.\nThe main variables of interest indicate whether all children are shared children of\nthe couple or whether at least one of the partners has brought a child into the\npartnership. The variable noshared takes value one if at least one respondent has a child\nwith an earlier partner and the couple has no shared child, and zero otherwise. Two\nfurther dummy variables indicate whether only the male (female) partner has a child but\nnot the female (male) partner (shenopar (henopar)). If the couple has one shared child\nand one or more non-shared children the variable shared1+ takes value one, and zero\notherwise. If the couple has at least two shared children and one or more non-shared\nchildren the variable shared2+ takes value one, and zero otherwise. If all five dummy\nvariables are included in the model, the baseline refers to the orthodox families, the\nparameter for noshared refers to couples where at least one partner has a child from an\nearlier relationship, and the parameters for shenopar and henopar test whether there are\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n322 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nvariations according to who of the partners is not yet a parent. The parameters for\nshared1+ and shared2+ can be used to test the sibling hypothesis.\nThe effects of duration are estimated by a spline function with nodes at one, two,\nand five years. Dur01 refers to the slope in the first year, dur12 to the slope in the\nsecond year, dur25 to the slope in years three to five, and dur5+ to the slope in all years\nthereafter. In addition, a conditional spline is estimated to allow for non-proportional\nbirth rates of couples with a shared child (reference) and couples without a shared child.\nThe conditional spline is coded as deviation from the baseline spline and has the same\nnodes as the baseline spline, namely at one, two and five years. The parameter\nnoshad01 is the slope of the conditional spline in the first year, noshad12 gives the\nslope in the second year, noshad25 in the following three years and noshad5+ in all\nlater years. (Note 10) The total number of children is the sum of his, her and the\ncouple\u2019s shared children. It is taken into account by dummy variables for two children\n(totpar2), three children (totpar3) and more than three children (totpar4+).\nWith these covariates the model specifications from section 3.1 can be written as\nLn \u03bb ( t | x ) = s\u0001 T ( t ) + \u03b21 (Total parity = 2) + \u03b22 (Total parity = 3)\n+ \u03b23 (Total parity \u2265 4) + \u03b24 (No shared child = 1) + \u03b25 (She no parent = 1)\n+ \u03b26 (He no parent = 1) + \u03b27 (One shared child + other = 1)\n+ \u03b28 (Two or more shared children + other = 1) + \u03b3\u0001 X\nwith X now the vector of values of the remaining covariates. The non-proportional\nhazard model can be written as\nLn \u03bb ( t | x ) = s\u0001 T ( t ) + As\n\u0001\nT ( t ) (No shared child = 1)\n+ \u03b21 (Total parity = 2) + \u03b22 (Total parity = 3) + \u03b23 (Total parity \u2265 4)\n+ \u03b24 (No shared child = 1) + \u03b25 (She no parent = 1) + \u03b26 (He no parent = 1)\n+ \u03b27 (One shared child + other = 1) + \u03b28 (Two or more shared children\n+ other = 1)\n+ \u03b3\u0001 X.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 323\nThe number of control variables in X is limited to men\u2019s and women\u2019s ages and\nhistorical time. Spline functions are estimated for the effects of age for both partners\nwith nodes at ages 25, 30, and 35. Wage<25 gives the yearly slope for women\u2019s ages\nbelow 25 years. The yearly slope during the following five years is wage2530 and for\nthe next five years it is wage3035. Finally wage35+ gives the yearly slope for women\u2019s\nages above 35. Men\u2019s effects of age are captured in the same way by mage<25,\nmage2530, mage3035 and mage35+.(Note 11) The effects of calendar time are also\nspecified as spline function with a node in 1980. The slope for the preceding years is\ncalled bef1980 and for the years after 1980 it is called aft1980. The models do not\ninclude further covariates because they focus on the general pattern of childbirth in\nstepfamilies and in orthodox families. Some estimated parameters have high standard\nerrors in the present model so that it is problematic to estimate a more complex model.\n5. Results from the multivariate models\nAppendices B and C give the full model estimations for the four samples. They show\nthe estimation results for both models, that is if the proportional hazard assumption for\nchild composition holds and if it is relaxed. For all four sub-samples the likelihood\nstatistic increases significantly when the proportional hazard assumption for parenthood\nexperience at the start of the partnership is relaxed. The model estimations are\nillustrated in Figures 2a to 2d, which give estimated hazard rates from the non-\nproportional models for the four selected child configurations in the four sub-samples.\nThe models are evaluated for the year 1980, parity two, women aged 25 in West and\naged 23 in East Germany and men aged 27 in West and aged 25 in East Germany.(Note\n12) The chosen ages correspond roughly to the mean ages of respondents at the start of\nstepfamilies (see Table 1a). Appendix D gives the corresponding figures for evaluations\nof the proportional hazard model.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n324 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 2a: Estimated Fertility Rates of West-German Men\nNote: Model evaluated for the year 1980, parity two, women aged 25 and men aged 27.\nFigure 2b: Estimated Fertility Rates of West-German Women\nNote: Model evaluated for the year 1980, parity two, women aged 25 and men aged 27.\n0,0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since previous child birth \nor begin of partnership\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n \nra\nte Shared child\nBoth parents\nHe no parent\nShe no parent\n  \n0,0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since previous child birth \nor begin of partnership\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n \nra\nte\nShared child\nBoth parents\nHe no parent\nShe no parent\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 325\nFigure 2c: Estimated Fertility Rates of East-German Men\nNote: Model evaluated for the year 1980, parity two, women aged 23 and men aged 25.\nFigure 2d: Estimated Fertility Rates of East-German Women\nNote: Model evaluated for the year 1980, parity two, women aged 23 and men aged 25.\n0,0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since previous child birth \nor begin of partnership\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n \nra\nte Shared child\nBoth parents\nHe no parent\nShe no parent\n0,0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nYears since previous child birth \nor begin of partnership\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n \nra\nte Shared child\nBoth parents\nHe no parent\nShe no parent\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n326 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nThe main difference between the baseline rates of orthodox couples and couples\nwithout a shared child refers to the first years of duration. For orthodox families the\nbirth rate increases from a rather low level, while birth rates start out from a much\nhigher level for couples without a shared child. Differences in birth rates are largest in\nEast Germany. For West-German women the birth rates are overall quite low. For\nWest-German men the estimated birth rates have an extreme shapes. This can be due to\nthe small number of observations. Rather than being regarded as precise estimates, the\nbirth rates in Figures 2a-2d should be interpreted as indicating approximate patterns.\nIn addition to different levels at start, birth rates of orthodox families and of\nfamilies without a shared child follow different patterns over time and, in some cases,\ncross each other. Therefore, comparing childbirth probabilities after short and after long\ndurations may lead to different conclusions. To assess the union-confirmation and the\nparenthood hypotheses probabilities are calculated of having another child within two,\nfour and six years respectively. These estimated probabilities are based on the model\nparameters using formula (7). Table 2 gives evaluations for couples with total parity\none at the start. (Note 13) These probabilities serve as illustrations of the estimated\nparameters. Because the couple has only one child yet, the transition to having a second\nchild does not allow distinguishing between parenthood and partnership effects. West-\nGerman couples with one child \u2013 either a shared child or the child of either of the\npartners \u2013 show little difference in the probabilities of having a second child between\nthe types of parenthood in the female sample. The estimated probabilities for West-\nGerman men are rather unreliable due to the small number of observations. The\ndifferences are larger in the East-German samples. Couples with no shared child have a\nhigher probability of having a second child within two years than couples who already\nhave a shared child in all samples apart from West-German men. This finding is in line\nwith the union-confirmation and the parenthood hypotheses. For longer durations this\npattern does, however, not hold any more for West-German women and East-German\nmen. The union-confirmation and parenthood hypotheses are supported in the short run\nbut not in the long run.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 327\nTable 2: Estimated probabilities for having a second child within two, four and six\nyears.

Couples with a shared child have the lowest probability of having\na third child in all samples apart from West-German men. For West-German women,\nthe probabilities of having a third child in orthodox families and in families where one\nof the partners is not yet a parent converge for longer durations. In the East-German\nsamples, the childbirth probabilities converge for orthodox families and families where\nthe partner is not yet a parent. Childbirth probabilities in families where the respondent\nis not yet a parent remain consistently higher than in the two previous groups in East\nGermany. In all four samples, couples where both partners have already a child from a\nprevious relationship start their childbearing fastest and, apart from West-German men,\nalso continue to have the highest probabilities for having another child. To sum up, the\nresults in Table 3 lend only limited support to the union-confirmation and the\nparenthood hypotheses especially for longer durations.\nFrom Table 3 three modifications of the union-commitment and the parenthood\nhypotheses can be tentatively derived. Firstly, the estimated probabilities suggest that\nthe union-commitment hypothesis may apply only to short durations. If a couple has not\nhad a first shared child within a few years of their partnership, they may not regard a\nshared child as an important symbol of their union to themselves or the outside world.\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n328 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nSecondly, the results concerning the parenthood hypothesis are mixed. For short\ndurations couples where one of the partners is not yet a parent have a higher childbirth\nprobability than orthodox families. For longer durations the probabilities of some of\nthese groups do not differ substantially from the childbirth probabilities of orthodox\nfamilies. Thirdly, the childbirth probabilities of couples where both partners already\nhave a child are higher than expected from the parenthood hypotheses. The very high\nbirth rates of these couples may actually be due to selection into these partnerships;\npartners who embark on forming such a complex family seem to be willing and desiring\nto have another child.\nTable 3: Estimated probabilities for having a third child within two, four and six\nyears.

There is no general pattern that would indicate that, for\nexample, birth rates are higher if the woman is no parent yet. In the model for West-\nGerman women there are no substantive differences between the male partner not being\na parent yet and the female partner not being a parent yet. The East-German models\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 329\nshow increased childbirth probabilities if the respondent is not yet a parent. In the\npresent paper I can only speculate about reasons for this pattern. A possible explanation\ntakes up the earlier discussed problems of identifying the other parent of respondents\u2019\nchildren. If a child that is classified as a child of the respondent is in fact a shared child\nof the couple, the birth rate of couples where one partner is no parent yet is\nunderestimated because some of the couples truly follow the lower birth rate of couples\nwith a shared child. However, classifying children born up to three years before the start\nof the partnership as shared child of the couple reduces the discrepancy between birth\nrates of couples where the respondent or the partner is not yet a parent, but it does not\nchange the basic pattern (no table).\nThe proportional hazard models in the present paper are specified exactly as the\nproportional-hazard model in the paper by Thomson et al. (in press). Differences in the\nestimates are due to differences in dealing with missing dates because Thomson and co-\nauthors have made no imputations when dates were incomplete. The non-proportional\nhazard model presented here can be regarded as a test for whether the very high\nestimated parameters in the German samples in the paper by Thomson et al. are due to a\nmodel misspecification. However, the estimated parameters in the non-proportional\nhazard model are even larger than in the proportional hazard model. In this respect the\nnon-proportional models confirm the conclusions about West Germany in the earlier\npaper, but they raise questions about the stability of the observed patterns over time at\nrisk.\n6. Summary and discussion\nThe present paper studies differences in birth rates of East- and West-German couples\nwith different combinations of shared and non-shared children. The paper presents\nhazard-rate models for having another child that do not assume that the hazards for\ncouples with and without shared children are proportional. Thereby the models can\nbetter take into account variations in the patterns of the timing of childbirth. This is\nimportant in the present study because couples with a shared child are assumed to be at\nrisk for having another child since the birth of the previous child, while the time at risk\nfor couples without a shared child starts at partnership formation. The results show that\nthe timing of childbirth follows different patterns for these two groups, couples without\na shared child having very high birth rates at short durations.\nThe hypotheses derived from the value-of-children approach are examined by\ncomputing the estimated probabilities for having a child within two, four or six years.\nThese probabilities suggest some modifications of the union-confirmation and the\nparenthood hypotheses. Firstly, the results support the union-confirmation hypothesis\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n330 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nfor short-term durations. For longer durations, some of the predicted differences\nbetween the types of families do not emerge any more. The different child\nconfigurations at the beginning of a partnership seem to indicate different childbearing\nplans at that time, but the longer the decision to have another child is postponed the less\nthe child configuration seems to matter.\nSecondly, the high birth rates of couples formed by two parents demand another\nmodification of the hypotheses formulated at the outset of the paper. The need for a\nconfirmation of the union by a shared child may vary between couples. It may be\nespecially those couples who embark on the adventure of forming a family where both\npartners bring a child from earlier relationships that the wish and the readiness for a\nshared child are comparatively high.\nThe suggested modifications of the union-commitment and the parenthood\nhypotheses are derived from the model estimated in this paper. Scholars may argue that\ninstead of distinguishing two time patterns in the fertility models it would be better to\nestimate separate baseline rates for more types of families. The attempt has been made\nbut the number of observations is so small that the estimated parameters are very\nvolatile. Therefore, they are not presented here.\nAnother possible shortcoming of this paper is that it ignores issues of union\nstability. Stepfamilies are less stable than families with shared children only.\nComparisons of childbirth probabilities between orthodox families and stepfamilies\nafter six years may be misleading because more stepfamilies have dissolved by this\ntime. The short-term differences in birth rates may actually reflect better the true\ndifferences in childbearing rates. Further research should incorporate aspects of union\nstability into models of fertility in stepfamilies and orthodox families.\n7.

For an overview see Heerkerens (1986).\n2.  Extending prior childbearing information to both partners causes an additional\nproblem. As Thomson describes, the NSFH does not provide direct information\nabout the relationship between the current spouse and the respondent\u2019s children\nwho have left home (Thomson 1997). Similar problems occur in the FFS data used\nin the present study. There is no direct information about the other parent of\nrespondent\u2019s children who have left home.\n3.  The records are also censored at the conception of a multiple birth.\n4.  Further details about the data as well as analyses of family formation with the FFS-\ndata are given in Hullen (1995).\n5.  The calculations are based on counting the number of partners in the partnership\nhistories. Among West-German men, 54% had no partner and 8% had lived with\nmore than two partners. Among West-German women, 39% had never lived with a\npartner and 8% had more than two partners. The corresponding numbers for East-\nGerman men are 31% and 11% and for East-German women 24% and 12%.\n6.  This corresponds to the procedure in Thomson and collaborators (in press).\n7.  Walter Bien and Markus Teubner (personal communication) have been so kind to\ncheck this interpretation with the data from the German Family Survey (GFS). The\nGFS provides dates of the beginning of the partnership as well as the dates of\nmoving together. Their computations showed that in nearly all cases when East\nGerman men reported a common child born before moving together this child was\nindeed born after the date of the beginning of the partnership. Therefore, it seems\nto be appropriate to classify them as shared children of the couple.\n8.  Looking at the 3049 first children born during or before first partnerships, 307 of\nthem are born in the year before the begin of the partnership, 112 and 61 in the two\npreceding years, and 117 more than three but no more than ten years before the\nstart of the partnership. To test how sensitive the results are to the classification\nrules, the rules have been varied and children born up to two years and up to three\nyears before a union have also been regarded as shared children of the couples.\nThese modifications lead only to minor changes in outcomes of the multivariate\nmodels.\n9.  If the identification rules for shared children are modified and respondent\u2019s\nchildren born within three years before the partnership are considered as shared\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\n332 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nchildren of the couple, the distributions change in the following way: 7 percent of\npartnerships of West-German men, and 9, 13, and 15 percent of partnerships of\nWest-German women, East-German men and East-German women have a non-\nshared child.\n10.  The estimated slopes dur01, dur12, dur25 and dur5+ have been called s0, s1, s2 and\ns3 in section 3.2 and noshad01, noshad12, noshad25, and noshad5+ have been\ncalled sA0, sA1, sA2 and sA3.\n11.  In the East-German samples there are very few observations for respondents aged\n35 and above. Therefore, there is no node at age 35 for East-German respondents.\n12.  The Figures give approximations of the estimated hazard rates. The values for\ncomplete years are exact. They are connected by smoothed lines unless the\nsmoothing procedure leads to negative values for estimated hazard rates.\n13.  The first probability in Table 2 - the estimated probability of having a second child\nfor partnerships of West-German men with a shared child \u2013 has been calculated as\ndescribed below. Calendar year has been coded as years since 1970 and age as\nyears since age 14. Therefore, the calendar year effect is evaluated for 10 years and\nthe age effects at 11 years for women and at 13 years for men. Using the estimated\ncoefficients from Appendix B, the probability of 0.36 is calculated as 1 \u2013 exp [ -\n(exp(-3.872 - 11*0.080 + 11*0.051 \u2013 2*0.043 + 10*0.134) \/ 1.717 *\n(exp(1.717)-1)) - (exp(-3.872 - 11*0.080 + 11*0.051 \u2013 2*0.043 + 10*0.134 + 1.717\n\u2013 0.105) \/ 0.105 * (exp(2 * 0.105) \u2013 exp(0.105)))].\nDemographic Research - Volume 7, Article 6\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 333\nReferences\nAndersen, Per K., \u00d8rnulf Borgan, Richard D.
