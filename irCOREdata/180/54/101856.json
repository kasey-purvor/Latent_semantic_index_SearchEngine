We would also like to thank the two anonymous \nreviewers who provided helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper. \nThis research was generously funded by the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese \nFoundation. \n \n  \nIntroduction \nChildren and young people regularly mention relationships within the peer \ngroup as the major factor that causes them to feel unsafe at school, with \nthousands of children each year (around 28,000 in 2006) telephoning \nChildLine for advice on bullying either on behalf of themselves or because of \ntheir concern for another young person (ChildLine, 2005). In fact, the \nChildren\u2019s Commissioner cited bullying as an issue that attracted a bigger \nresponse from children and young people than any other aspect of his work \n(Aynsley-Green, 2006, p. 65).  Surveys regularly remind us of the extent of \nthe problem.  For example, Oliver and Candappa (2003) found that half of all \nthe primary school children and more than one in four secondary school \nchildren in the UK said they had been bullied in the last term.  \n \nSince bullying is a subjective experience, it is important to take account of \nwhat young people have to say on the matter.   To this end, and in line with \nthe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1991) and the Every Child \nMatters agenda (DfES, 2004; DfES, 2005a; DfES, 2005b; DfES, 2006; \nOFSTED, 2005), government legislation now requires that schools consult \nchildren and young people on issues that concern them. This has resulted in \nmany innovative systems that facilitate the involvement of young people, for \nexample, in school councils, youth parliaments or other democratic systems.  \nOne of the most direct, hands-on ways in which to engage pupils\u2019 active \nparticipation in systems designed to tackle bullying has been the development \nof peer support systems.     \nThe philosophy of peer support is in harmony with the four core principles \nunderlying the United Nations Convention: non-discrimination; devotion to the \nbest interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and \nrespect for the views of the child.  The most relevant principle in the present \n 2\npaper concerns the process of listening to the voice of the child.  In essence, \nteachers who facilitate peer-led methods encourage young people to show \nrespect for others, to have empathy for their feelings, to act co-operatively and \ndemocratically in their groups. \nOver 50% of primary and secondary schools in the UK now have some form \nof peer support in place in the form of buddying\/befriending, mentoring, active \nlistening and conflict resolution (Smith and Samara, 2003). Peer support \nsystems have enormous potential to provide young people with opportunities \nto address bullying immediately in everyday contexts, and, at a wider level, to \nbe involved in the development of policies to ensure that schools are safe and \npleasant places to be.  Many teachers who co-ordinate peer support systems \nencourage peer supporters to play an active part in managing the schemes, \nand there is evidence that this can be perceived as a significant catalyst for \nchange (Cowie et al, 2002). Peer support systems have changed as young \npeople involved have become more creative and confident in developing the \nsystems in which they have been trained to play a part, for example by \nmaking changes in the logistics of peer support, and developing use of the \ninternet and e-mail support (Cartwright, 2005; Cowie & Hutson, 2005; Hutson \n& Cowie, in press).   \n \nThere is no doubt that peer supporters benefit greatly from the training; those \nwhom they help directly also report that their intervention is helpful (Cowie et \nal, 2002; Lane-Garon, Ybarra-Merlo, Zajac & Vierra, 2005; Naylor & Cowie, \n1999; Smith and Watson, 2004).  But does peer support actually reduce \nbullying and does it therefore make schools safer? \n \nResearch findings indicate a subjective impression that bullying rates are \nreduced by the activity of a peer support system.  Selected teachers, often the \npeople responsible for the running of the system, can often be euphoric about \nthe impact of a peer support service on their schools.  One teacher from the \nMental Health Foundation project on peer support concluded that the \npresence of a peer support system led to \u2018enrichment of the life of the school\u2019 \n(quoted in Scherer-Thompson, 2002, p. 11).  A deputy-head teacher on the \n 3\nChildLine peer support project (quoted in ChildLine, 2005, p. 2) claimed that, \nas a result of peer support, \u2018bullying rates have been drastically reduced, our \nexam rates are better than they were five years ago, and attendance figures \nare the best we have ever had, up from 89% to 95% now.  Kids come to a \nschool when they\u2019re happy, and they don\u2019t come when they\u2019re not.\u2019 \n \nThe ChildLine report on peer support (ChildLine, 2005, p. 3) made dramatic \nclaims about the impact that peer support had on bullying and its role in \ncreating safer schools: \n \n\u2018On a school-wide level, peer support can radically improve the atmosphere of \na school, allowing pupils to feel safer and more supported, while \nsimultaneously freeing teachers of the unwelcome task of having to be \ndisciplinarians first and educators second.\u2019 \n \nSome research confirms these views.  For example, Lane-Garon and \nRichardson (2003) studied the impact of a peer mediation scheme on school \nclimate in a sample of 300 elementary school pupils.  Both mediators and \nnon-mediators perceived the school climate to be safer than had been \nreported in the year prior to the introduction of the peer mediation scheme.  \nHowever, it is important to note that in this scheme large numbers of pupils \nreceived the training and this, according to the researchers, played an \nimportant part in enhancing the impact on perceptions of safety.  In \nconfirmation of this hypothesis, Lane-Garon et al (2005) compared 35 children \ntrained as mediators with matched controls who had not been trained.  One \nyear after the introduction of the Mediator Mentors Program, mediators \ndemonstrated significantly higher gains in measures of social-cognitive \ndevelopment when compared to non-mediators.  Additionally, the researchers \nfound that there appeared to be less yelling and hitting in the families of \nmediators in comparison to non-mediators, suggesting that the children were \npractising their mediation skills at home. \n \n 4\nHowever, in contrast to the positive endorsements of peer support, some researchers \nhave sounded a note of caution.   Naylor and Cowie (1999) found that the incidence of \nbullying in their sample of 51 schools with an established peer support system was \nsimilar to that reported in other schools (without a peer support system) at the time, e.g. \nWhitney and Smith (1993).  They concluded that the presence of a peer support system \nin itself does not appear to bring about a reduction of bullying but they also noted that the \nmajority of peer supporters, users and potential users of the systems and teachers in \ntheir schools believed that bullying had decreased, even though the \u2018objective\u2019 evidence \nobtained from the questionnaires did not confirm this. Cowie and Olafsson (2001) \nactually found some increase in bullying three terms after the introduction of a peer \nsupport system, although also increased rates of reporting by those who were bullied.  \nThis was a very atypical school, but it does illustrate that positive outcomes at the \nbroader school level cannot be taken for granted. \nIn their evaluation of the CHIPS peer support intervention, Smith and Watson (2004) \nidentified a range of perspectives on the effectiveness of peer support in creating safer \nschools and, in particular, on reducing rates of bullying.  Many staff and pupils believed \nthat there were positive effects on general levels of school bullying or peer relationships, \nbut many were also unsure.  The degree to which the peer support strategy had been \nintegrated into the whole school policy or \u2018ethos\u2019 was often a contributing factor to its \nsuccess, suggesting that for it to succeed the peer support system needed to be a \ncoherent part of the whole-school strategy for counteracting bullying.  Schools that made \npupils aware of the scheme, through the use of assemblies, newsletters, posters and \npresentations, often found that the scheme became more accepted, and the peer \nmentors earned respect and credibility from fellow pupils. But the researchers also \nobserved that it was rare to find any interaction between schools in terms of planned \nsharing of expertise, experience and examples of good practice. None of the schools \noffered mentors the opportunity to exchange ideas with pupils from other schools. \nFurthermore, there was little continuity between primary and secondary sectors, with \nsecondary schools failing to capitalise on the skills of peer mentors moving up from \nprimary education.  Some of the peer supporters complained that teachers failed to give \nthem enough responsibility and too often under-valued the skills that they had learned in \ntraining. \n \n 5\nWe felt, in planning this research, that it was timely to carry out a comparison \nof schools with and schools without peer support in order to see if there were \nindeed positive outcomes with regard to pupils\u2019 perceptions of safety at \nschool. The present research reports on the analysis of qualitative data from a \nsurvey carried out with 931 pupils in four secondary schools, two with peer \nsupport and two without.  The quantitative analysis (Cowie, Hutson, Oztug & \nMyers, 2008) revealed very little difference between pupil perceptions of \nsafety in schools with and schools without a peer support system in place.  In \nfact, older pupils in the schools without peer support responded that they felt \nsafer than pupils in schools with a peer support system in toilets and lessons.  \nHowever, within the peer support schools there were significant differences in \nperceptions of safety between the substantial minority of pupils who were \nunaware that their school had a peer support system and those who were \naware of it.  The pupils who were aware felt safer in lessons, perceived school \nas a friendlier place to be, worried significantly less about being bullied in \ncomparison with those who were unaware.  They were also much more likely \nto tell someone when bad things happened at school.  The researchers \nargued that unless a peer support system is widely disseminated as part of \nthe whole-school strategy to counteract bullying and violence, it will fail to \nreach a proportion of pupils who may well be those in particular need of help.  \nThe present study was concerned to find out what were the particular safety \nissues that concerned the pupils in the four schools and what were their \nsuggestions for making changes within the school that would make them feel \nmore secure.    We were also interested to discover whether the suggestions \nfor improvement were ones that peer supporters had the potential to put into \npractice. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nThe research was carried out in four secondary schools in a small rural town, \neach with a well-organised pastoral care system and an active anti-bullying \npolicy. The study involved a total of 931 pupils, (49.5% males, 50.5% \nfemales).  Participants were aged between 11 and 15 years of age.  \n 6\nTwo schools that already had established peer support schemes were \nmatched with two schools which had yet to commence their peer support \ntraining.  All other demographic variables were matched to the best of our \nability through examining the census data for the schools (OFSTED \nInspection Reports).  There appeared to be nothing of any significance in the \nvariations that could have led to bias in the results. \nInstruments \nThe survey was carried out using the School Climate Questionnaire (Myers & \nHutson, unpublished) that consisted of three open ended questions \u2018Where do \nyou feel least safe and why?\u2019, \u2018Where do you feel most safe and why\u2019, and \n\u2018What are your suggestions for making the school a better place?\u2019. The \npresent paper aims to address participants\u2019 responses to these questions.  \nProcedure \nThe questionnaire was administered during a PSHE lesson by the classroom \nteachers. We provided each school with the required number of \nquestionnaires and a script to read out to each class. Once the questionnaires \nwere completed anonymously the schools posted them to the research team \nat the University of Surrey in pre-paid envelopes. \nSpecific instructions were provided to the teachers, and anonymity of each \nparticipant was assured to each class.  Informed consent was obtained from \nschools, pupils and parents. The questionnaires were personally delivered to \nthe Head Teachers by members of the research team, and personally \ncollected, so that any issues could be resolved face to face.  The schools \nwere asked to participate and agreed in writing after receiving an information \npack.  All parents of participating pupils were sent a letter the week before \nand information pack about the research using an opt-out format.  On the day \nthe research took place, pupils were again reminded that they could withdraw \nat any time and that participation was entirely voluntary.  Each pupil also \nreceived an information pack about the research.  In the event, no pupils or \nparents opted out of the research.  The researchers agreed to feedback the \nfindings to each individual school.   \n 7\nQualitative analysis \nAll responses to the questions were transferred to spreadsheet software \nMicrosoft Office Excel. The data were coded by examining each response, \nquestion by question, The questions \u2018Where do you feel least safe and why?\u2019 \nand  \u2018Where do you feel most safe and why\u2019 were coded under the two \nthemes of \u2018places where pupils felt safe or unsafe\u2019 and \u2018reasons for feeling \nsafe or unsafe\u2019. The codes obtained as a result of the analysis were then \narranged into logical categories.  \nThe responses to the final question \u2018what are your suggestions for making the \nschool a better place?\u2019 were initially reviewed for identification of the major \nthemes in the data. The responses were then coded by breaking down the \nmajor themes into sub-themes wherever possible. \n \nResults \nIn answer to the question \u2018Where do you feel most safe?\u2019 the most frequent \nresponse referred to feeling safe in the classroom, with slightly more pupils in \npeer support schools (PS) (22.4%) than non-peer support schools (NPS) \n(18.5%) stating that they felt safest in lessons with a teacher present (Figure \n1).  \n \nWhere do you feel most safe?\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%\ndon\u2019t know\/no answer\nnowhere\nanywhere\/everywhere\nfield\/playground\nblocks\ntoilets\ncanteen\/dinner hall\ncorridors\/stairs\/ moving between lessons\nlessons\nhome\/with family members\nlibrary\nPercentage\nNon-peer support\nPeer support\n \n 8\nFigure 1: Graphical representation of places where pupils felt most safe at school \n \n The most common explanation for feeling safe referred to the support or \npresence of other people, with slightly more PS (62.7%) than NPS (56.1%) \nciting the presence of friends, teachers or others (Figure 2).  \n \nWhere do you feel most safe\/ why?\n30.0%\n62.7%\n3.9%\n36.1%\n56.1%\n3.4%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\nNo answer\/reason Accompany Home\/family\nPeer-support\nNon-Peer support\n \nFigure 2: Graphical representation of reasons why PS and NPS pupils felt most safe at school \n \n In answer to the question \u2018Where do you feel most unsafe and why?\u2019, the \nmost unsafe places reported by the whole sample were play areas \n(playground and field) (20.8%), toilets (15.3%), corridors\/stair and other \nplaces where there was movement between lessons (9.5%), and journeys to \nand from school (7.7%) (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Frequency and percentages of pupils who felt unsafe with respect to the places in \nand outside of school \n 9\nN % N % N %\ndon\u2019t know\/no answer 109 11.7% 127 13.6% 236 25.3%\nnowhere 31 3.3% 52 5.6% 83 8.9%\nanywhere\/everywhere 14 1.5% 7 0.8% 21 2.3%\nfield\/playground 100 10.7% 94 10.1% 194 20.8%\nblocks 3 0.3% 11 1.2% 14 1.5%\ntoilets 90 9.7% 53 5.7% 143 15.3%\ncanteen\/dinner hall 5 0.5% 11 1.2% 16 1.7%\ncorridors\/stairs\/ moving between lessons 55 5.9% 34 3.6% 89 9.5%\nlessons 9 1.0% 11 1.2% 20 2.1%\noutside school\/walking home\/ bus\/other 29 3.1% 43 4.6% 72 7.7%\nwith seniors\/older pupils 3 0.3% 9 1.0% 12 1.3%\nwith tutor\/teacher 6 0.6% 0 0.0% 6 0.6%\nchanging rooms\/lockers 2 0.2% 1 0.1% 3 0.3%\nother 10 1.1% 10 1.1% 20 2.1%\nPeer support Non-peer support Overall\n \n \n \n \n \nThere were no differences between PS (10.7%) and NPS (10.1%) with regard \nto play areas and only very small differences concerning journeys to and from \nschool (PS = 3.1%; NPS = 4.6%).  But substantially more PS (9.7%) felt \nunsafe in the toilets than NPS (5.7%) and in corridors\/stairs (PS=5.9%; \nNPS=3.6%) (see Table 2.) The most frequently given reasons for feeling \nunsafe concerned bullying (PS=22.1%; NPS=24.5%). Interestingly, pupils \nfrom PS (5.6%) schools felt less worried about older peers than pupils from \nNPS (9.5%). At the same time, they worried more about lack of protection \nfrom intruders and strangers on school premises (PS= 10.3%; NPS=4.1%). It \nis also worth noting that a comparatively high percentage of both PS and NPS \nhad no answer to the question about why (35%) or where (25%) they felt \nunsafe in school.

There were also \nrequests to improve the school facilities (PS=9.2%; NPS=7.3%) with a \nparticular emphasis in the PS schools on improving the toilet areas.  Slightly \nmore PS (3.2%) than NPS (0.2%) asked for action against smoking and this \nwas most likely connected with their reports of smokers and \u2018chavs\u2019 in toilet \nareas whose presence was menacing or threatening. (\u2018Chav\u2019 is a derogatory \nslang term in popular usage throughout the UK. It refers to a subculture \nstereotype of a person who is uneducated, uncultured and prone to antisocial \nor immoral behaviour.) \n \nDiscussion \nThe findings provided little evidence that the presence of a peer support \nsystem enhanced feelings of safety in the school population. On the positive \nside, PS pupils were slightly more aware of the value of having other people \naround as a means of enhancing feelings of safety. They were also less afraid \nof older pupils indicating that peer supporters may have influenced the \nattitudes of some older pupils towards younger peers and may have made \nthem friendlier. However; for the PS pupils, toilets and corridors\/stairs were \nless safe for them than for NPS pupils, largely because of the unpleasant \nactions of the peer group towards them.  With specific regard to bullying, there \nwas no difference between PS and NPS.  Around one-fifth of both PS and \nNPS pupils reported that the reason for feeling unsafe was because of \nbullying.   The most common suggestions for making school a better place \nreferred to action against bullying, with more PS mentioning people who \nsmoke and unpleasant people or \u2018chavs\u2019. \n \nGiven the continued prevalence of bullying and its impact on health and well-\nbeing, it is essential that schools use to the optimum effect the skills that peer \nsupporters learn in training.  They also need to pay much more than lip-\nservice to the active involvement of young people in resolving issues that \ndirectly affect them, such as bullying, in order to safeguard children and young \npeople. The present study indicated a worrying gap between the willingness \n 11\nof the peer supporters to help reduce bullying and the real anxieties of the \nschool population about issues that made them feel unsafe. Certain places \nsuch as toilets presented everyday challenges to many pupils yet the peer \nsupport system did not appear to have developed procedures to address the \nproblem. Furthermore, there appeared to be no system for the peer \nsupporters to carry out any form of pupil evaluation of the service that they \noffered. Anti-bullying policies should routinely involve children and young \npeople in developing solutions to bullying and monitoring the effectiveness of \ninterventions such as peer support. It would also be beneficial to find out more \nabout the relatively large proportion of pupils who felt unsafe but simply had \nno answer to the questions about why or where they felt unsafe. We \nrecommend that not only should peer supporters carry out regular evaluations \nof the service but also facilitate representative focus groups of other young \npeople in order to brain storm ideas for future improvements.   \n \nThere may also be an argument for the training to be carried out with a much \nwider population of young people.  Research into peer mediation programmes \nindicates that training only a small number of mediators is not preventative of \nviolence or favourable to optimum developmental outcomes and, in fact, there \nis evidence that as the number of trained mediators grows in proportion to the \nschool population so school climate effects are more likely (Lane-Garon & \nRichardson, 2003). One suggestion that came from 4 pupils in one of the PS \nschools in the present study was to offer training to the bullies.  \n \nWe end with a list of recommendations that those involved in the running of \npeer support systems and in the training of peer supporters may like to \nconsider: \n \n\u2022 Carry out regular surveys and focus groups to discover if they are \nmeeting the needs of the school population \n\u2022 Training should incorporate peer research skills \n\u2022 Be aware of the diverse places in which bullying takes place \n\u2022 Listen to the peer group \n 12\n\u2022 Gather regular feedback on the impact of their service on the school \npopulation \n\u2022 Patrol areas of particular risk, such as toilets, play areas, corridors; \n\u2022 Identify priority issues that need to be addressed  \n\u2022 Learn how to play an active participant role in challenging bullying \n\u2022 Play an active role in the development of the school anti bullying policy \nand practice  \n  \nReferences \nAynsley-Green, A.
