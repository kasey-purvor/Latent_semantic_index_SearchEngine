In explicitly including\nconsideration of biological evidence and implications,\nthe ACCE report provides a logical advance from \u2018The\nState of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Climate System\u2019\n(SASOCS) report (Mayewski et al. 2009), whose purpose\nwas to review \u2018developments in our understanding of the\nstate of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate and its\nrelation to the global climate system over the last few\nmillennia\u2019. For the purposes of the ACCE report and the\ncurrent review, the Antarctic region (Fig. 1) is considered to\ninclude the continent of Antarctica, its offshore islands\nincluding the sub-Antarctic islands, the surrounding Southern\nOcean including the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (the\nnorthern boundary of which is the sub-Antarctic Front), and\nSouthern Ocean islands that lie north of the sub-Antarctic\nFront and yet fall into SCAR\u2019s area of interest, including Ile\nAmsterdam, Ile St Paul and Gough Island.\nAntarctica is renowned as being the highest, driest, windiest\nand coldest continent, boasting the lowest recorded temperature\non Earth, -89.28C, at Russia\u2019s Vostok Station on the Polar\nPlateau (Turner et al. in press). The continent with its ice\nshelves and islands covers an area of approximately\n143106 km2, which is about 10% of the land surface of the\nEarth. Most of the continent, apart from the northern part of the\nAntarctic Peninsula lies, south of the Antarctic Circle (at\nlatitude 66833'39''S), beyond which there is 24 hours of\ncontinuous daylight at the summer solstice in December,\nand 24 hours continuous darkness at the winter solstice\nin June.\nMoving inland, the surface rises rapidly and the\ncontinent has the highest mean elevation of any continent\non Earth, at around 2200m. It is dominated by the\nAntarctic Ice Sheet, a contiguous mass of glacial ice that\nrests on the continent and surrounding seas, contains\naround 30 x 106 km3 of ice or 70% of the Earth\u2019s freshwater\nand covers over 99.6% of the continent. The ice sheet is\nmade up of three distinct glaciological zones, the East\nAntarctic (EAIS, covering an area of 10.35 x 106 km2),\nWest Antarctic (WAIS, 1.97 x 106 km2) and Antarctic\nPeninsula (APIS, 0.52 x 106 km2) ice sheets. The EAIS\nincludes the high Polar Plateau, while the WAIS is lower\nin altitude. The EAIS and WAIS are separated by the\nTransantarctic Mountains, which rise above the surrounding\nice sheet to a maximum height of 4528m, and extend from\nVictoria Land to the Ronne Ice Shelf. The Antarctic Peninsula\nis the only part of the continent that extends a significant\nway northwards from the main ice sheet. It is a narrow\nmountainous region with an average width of 70 km and a\n541\nmean height of 1500m. The northern tip of the Peninsula is\nclose to 638S, forming a barrier that has a major influence\non the oceanic and atmospheric circulations of the high\nsouthern latitudes.\nThe ice sheet is nourished at its surface by deposition of\nsnow and frost which, because of the year-round cold, does\nnot melt but accumulates year-on-year. As the surface snow is\nburied by new snowfall, it is compressed and eventually\ntransformed into solid ice, a process that captures a chemical\nrecord of past climates and environments. In places, the\ndeepest ice may be more than one million years old. The ice\ngradually flows down to the edge of the continent in a number\nof ice streams and outlet glaciers that move at speeds of up to\na few kilometres per year, transporting around 2000x109\ntonnes of ice per year from the interior to the coast. Once the\nice streams reach the edge of the continent they either calve\ninto icebergs, which drift away within the surrounding seas, or\nstart to float on the ocean as ice shelves, which can be several\nhundreds of metres thick. The ice shelves constitute 11% of\nthe total area of the Antarctic, with the two largest being the\nRonne\u2013Filchner Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea and the Ross Ice\nShelf in the Ross Sea, which have areas of 0.53x 106 km2 and\n0.54 x 106 km2 respectively.\nThe formation of deep and bottom ocean waters of\nAntarctic origin occurs over the continental shelves of the\ncontinent. The process starts with the formation of sea ice\nover the continental shelf along the front of the ice shelves,\nespecially where winds move newly formed sea ice\nseawards away from the ice shelf to form polynyas. Sea\nice formation rejects salt, leading to the formation of High\nSalinity Shelf Water (HSSW). This can mix with Warm\nDeep Water (WDW) from the mid-levels of the sub-polar\ngyres, either over the shelf in areas where WDW penetrates\nonto the shelf in modified form, or over the slopes in\nregions where the dense water can spill off the shelf more\ndirectly (e.g. Gill 1973, Foster & Carmack 1976, Gordon\n1998). These processes lead to the formation of deep and\nbottom waters, often termed collectively as Antarctic\nBottom Water (AABW); these spread northwards to cool\nand aerate most of the global deep ocean floor, and provide\na fairly stable thermal environment for bottom dwelling\n(benthic) organisms. A further route for AABW formation\nexists, whereby dense shelf waters penetrate beneath the\nfloating ice shelves. This water mixes with fresh meltwater\nfrom the base of the ice shelves to form slightly less dense\nIce Shelf Water (ISW) (Nicholls et al. 2009). When this\nISW cools it becomes denser and exits from beneath the ice\nshelves, flowing down the continental slope and eventually\ncontributing to the AABW layers.\nIn the seas surrounding Antarctica, the continental shelf\nis unusually deep, reaching 800m in places, as a side effect\nof the continent being depressed by the weight of the ice\nsheets. The shallower parts are impacted by modern\nicebergs, most intensely at depths up to tens, but\noccasionally to several hundreds, of metres. More than\nFig. 1. a.

The seabed features form key elements\nof the habitats of marine organisms, and constrain ocean\ncirculation.\nIn a visible contrast with the simple ecosystems and\nexpanses of apparently barren ground that characterize the\nphysically isolated ecosystems on land, many benthic\norganisms live on the Antarctic continental shelf, which\ncomprises almost 15% of the global continental shelf area -\nin total around 4.63 106 km2. Biomass and diversity in\nthese marine ecosystems may be second only to those of\ntropical coral reefs. Floating ice shelves cover about one\nthird of the shelf, while the rest is covered by sea ice for\naround half the year. Both the sea and the seabed below the\nice shelves remain among the least known habitats on\nEarth, owing to their inaccessibility.\nThe continent is surrounded by the sea ice zone, where,\nby late winter, the ice on average covers an area of\n203 106 km2, which is more than the area of the continent\nitself. At this time of year the northern edge of the sea ice is\nclose to 608S around most of the continent, and near 558S to\nthe north of the Weddell Sea. Unlike the Arctic, most of the\nAntarctic sea ice melts during the summer so that by\nautumn it covers only an area of about 33 106 km2. Most\nAntarctic sea ice is therefore first-year ice up to 1\u20132m\nthick, with the largest area of thicker multi-year ice being\nover the western Weddell Sea.\nThe Antarctic plays a central role in the global climate\nsystem. This is driven by solar radiation, most of which\narrives at low latitudes, with the Equator receiving about\nfive times as much radiation annually as the poles and so\ncreating a large Equator-to-pole temperature difference.\nThe atmospheric and oceanic circulations respond to this\nlarge horizontal temperature gradient by transporting heat\npolewards. The planet\u2019s climate system can be regarded as\na thermodynamic engine, with the low latitude areas being\nthe heat source and the polar regions the heat sink.\nThe wind system and the meridional gradient in buoyancy\ninput give rise to the Southern Ocean\u2019s Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent (ACC), which links the major ocean basins in the\nglobal ocean system (Fig. 1b). Under the influence of the\nCoriolis force of the Earth\u2019s rotation, westerly winds cause\nSouthern Ocean surface waters to be diverted northward. The\nsurface waters are replaced by Circum-polar Deep Water\nupwelling from below, derived ultimately from North Atlantic\nDeep Water. The northward moving surface water in the ACC\nthen sinks to produce Antarctic Intermediate Water and sub-\nAntarctic Mode Water. A separate component of the upwelled\nwater spreads southward and into the sub-polar gyres, where it\nis involved in AABW formation. These branches are,\nrespectively, the upper and lower limbs of the overturning\ncirculation in the Southern Ocean, and lead to the seas around\nAntarctica being especially important in the global ocean\noverturning (Rintoul et al. 2001).\nThe marine carbon cycle can be described in terms of\nanthropogenic and natural carbon cycles, but from an oceanic\nperspective these two are treated almost exactly the same. The\nanthropogenic carbon cycle includes the emissions of CO2\ninto the atmosphere that have continued at an increasing rate\nsince the start of the industrial revolution. The natural carbon\ncycle includes the behaviour of the carbon in the ocean prior\nto the industrial revolution. It is estimated that 30% of the\ntotal anthropogenic emissions annually are taken up and\nsequestered by the ocean (Sabine et al. 2004). The Southern\nOcean plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. The\nupwelling deep water south of the Polar Front brings to the\nsurface dissolved nutrients and carbon dioxide (CO2), and\nreleases this gas to the atmosphere. In contrast, water masses\nsinking north of the Polar Front take up CO2 from the\natmosphere, including some of the CO2 released to the\natmosphere by human activities. These complementary\nprocesses make the Southern Ocean both a source and a\nsink for atmospheric CO2, with any change in this balance\nbeing of global significance.\nBecause of its upwelling nutrients, the Southern Ocean is\nthe world\u2019s most biologically productive ocean, although\nits productivity is also limited by the low availability of\nmicronutrients such as iron, except around the islands that\nare scattered through the ACC. As a result the Southern\nOcean is classified as a High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll\n(HNLC) region. Through photosynthesis, the growth of\nphytoplankton extracts CO2 from the atmosphere and\npumps it to the seabed or into subsurface waters through\nthe sinking of decaying organic matter. Without this\nprocess, and without the solution of CO2 in cold dense\nsinking water near the coast, the build up of this gas in the\natmosphere would be much faster.\nIn terms of understanding the biology of the Earth System,\nthe poles fulfil a very special role. Their slowly changing\nphysico-chemical features have engineered life processes so\nthat organisms surviving the ensuing severe selection pressures\ncan prosper in such extreme habitats. It is unreasonable to\ninvestigate life in Earth\u2019s extreme environments without\nalso addressing the impacts of current climate changes on\norganisms whose adaptations to climatic conditions have\nslowly evolved over geological time to reach equilibrium. This\nequilibrium is delicate, and the Antarctic and its biota currently\ncommand increasing attention in a world attuned to\nchanges in global climate, loss of biological diversity and\ndepletion of marine fisheries. The links between long-\nand short-term global climate change and evolution are\namong the least understood natural events in the history of\nthe Earth. Excellent examples are available for study in\nthe Antarctic. Understanding the impact of past, current and\npredicted environmental change on biodiversity and the\nconsequences for Antarctic ecosystem adaptation and\nfunction must be a primary goal of research today.\nThe critical examination of Antarctic ecosystems\nundergoing change provides a major contribution to the\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 543\nunderstanding of evolutionary processes of relevance to\nlife on Earth. How well are Antarctic organisms able to\ncope with daily, seasonal and longer-term environmental\nchanges? Will climate change result in relaxation of\nselection pressure on genomes, or tighter constraints and\nultimately extinction of species and populations? The\nAntarctic holds great potential for studies in evolutionary\nbiology, playing an important role in understanding the\nbiological response to climate change within the whole\nEarth system. There is evidence that climate change, and\nmodifications of the Earth system, occur in the polar\nregions at faster rates than elsewhere. The uniquely adapted\nfauna and flora of these regions are vulnerable to shifts in\nclimate. Therefore, it is urgent to establish the state of\nAntarctic ecosystems, and in particular their diversity. To\nassess reliably the extent of future changes in polar\necosystems, integration of studies and data is required\nacross continental scales to bring undisputable evidence\nof change in ecosystem structure, functioning or services.\nUnprecedented international collaborative research effort in\nthe recent International Polar Year framework and beyond\nwill provide scientists, environmental managers and\ndecision-makers with a solid benchmark against which\nfuture changes can reliably be assessed.\nWith this brief background illustrating both the central role\nof the Antarctic in the global climate system and oceanic\nprocesses, and that of its biology in understanding the\npotential responses of biota and ecosystems to change\nprocesses, the publication of the ACCE report (Turner et al.\n2009a) is a pivotal and timely event, providing an essential\nSouthern Hemisphere companion to the Arctic Climate Impact\nAssessment (ACIA; Arctic Council 2005). The purpose of this\npresent review is to provide an accessible overview of the\nmajor elements and conclusions of the ACCE report. The\nreport is extensively referenced and, while we provide salient\nliterature sources relevant to each subject discussed here, we\nrefer the reader to the report itself for more thorough access\nto literature across the many disciplines covered. The online\nversion of the report (http:\/\/www.scar.org\/publications\/\noccasionals\/acce.html) is also intended as a living document,\nwhich will be updated over time.\nThe geological dimension (deep time)\nStudying the history of Antarctica\u2019s climate and environment\nprovides the context for understanding present day climate\nand environmental changes. It allows researchers to determine\nthe processes that led to the development of our present\ninterglacial period and to define the ranges of natural climate\nand environmental variability on timescales from decades to\nmillennia that have prevailed over the past millions of years.\nKnowing the boundaries of this natural variability enables us\nto identify when present day changes exceed the natural state.\nConcentrations of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the\natmosphere ranged from roughly 3000 ppm (parts per\nmillion) in the Early Cretaceous 130 million years ago\n(Ma) to about 1000 ppm in the Late Cretaceous (at 70Ma)\nand Early Cenozoic (at 45Ma), leading to global\ntemperatures 68 or 78C warmer than present (e.g. Royer\n2006). These high CO2 levels were products of the Earth\u2019s\nbiogeochemical cycles. During these times there was little\nor no ice on land. The first continental-scale ice sheets\nformed on Antarctica around 34Ma, most probably in\nresponse to a decline in atmospheric CO2 levels caused by a\ncombination of reduced CO2 out-gassing from mid-ocean\nridges and volcanoes, and increased carbon burial (Pearson\n& Palmer 2000). This decline resulted in a fall in global\ntemperatures to around 48C higher than today (DeConto &\nPollard 2003, Pagani et al. 2005). At maxima these early\nice sheets reached the edge of the Antarctic continent, but\nwere most probably warmer and thinner than those present\ntoday. Further rapid cooling took place at around 14Ma,\nprobably accelerated by the growing physical and thermal\nisolation of Antarctica as other continents drifted away\nfrom it, and as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)\ndeveloped (Flower & Kennett 1994). At that time the ice\nsheet thickened to more or less its modern configuration.\nDuring the Pliocene (5\u20133Ma), mean global temperatures\nwere 2\u201338C above pre-industrial values, CO2 values may\nhave reached 400 ppm, and sea levels were 15\u201325m above\ntoday\u2019s (Jansen et al. 2007).\nThe earliest cold-climate marine fauna is thought to date\nfrom the latest Eocene\u2013Oligocene (,35Ma). The\nestablishment of the Polar Front, separating warm water in\nthe north from cold water in the south, created a barrier for\nmigration of shallow and open-water marine organisms\nbetween the Antarctic and lower latitudes (Barnes et al.\n2006). This promoted adaptive evolution to cold temperature\nand extreme seasonality to develop in isolation, and led to the\ncurrent Antarctic marine biota, which is second only to coral\nreefs in terms of species diversity and biomass (Clarke &\nJohnston 2003). In contrast to marine faunas elsewhere, the\nAntarctic fish fauna is dominated by a single, highly endemic,\ntaxonomic group - the notothenioid fish (Notothenioidei). The\nevolution of antifreeze proteins and the loss of the oxygen-\ncarrying pigments haemoglobin and myoglobin in members\nof a family in this suborder is a particularly advanced\nadaptation to the environment (DeVries & Cheng 2005,\nEastman 2000, Sidell & O\u2019Brien 2006). This dominance by\na single taxonomic group of fish provides a simplified natural\nlaboratory for exploring their adaptive evolution. Amongst\nother groups typical of faunas of lower latitudes, crabs,\nlobsters and sharks are largely absent. The development of sea\nice made the success of krill (which relies on it as a \u2018nursery\nground\u2019) possible and, consequently, shaped the higher\ntrophic (feeding) levels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.\nDeeper water faunas (Gutt 2007) are not subject to the same\ndegree of isolation provided by the ACC in the upper layers\nof the ocean profile, and invertebrates inhabiting the deep sea\nhave been able to continue considerable exchange with\n544 PETER CONVEY et al.\nnortherly adjacent areas due to sharing similar environmental\nconditions (Clarke et al. 2009).\nIn an analogous fashion, circumpolar atmospheric\ncirculation patterns have isolated terrestrial habitats from\npotential sources of colonists at lower latitudes (Barnes et al.\n2006). In some contrast with the marine environment, the\ncombination of continental scale ice sheet formation and\nadvance, and extreme environmental conditions, led to large-\nscale (but incomplete) extinction of pre-existing biota, and to\nevolutionary divergence and radiation amongst the remaining\nsurvivors. Fossil evidence shows the change from species\nassociated with the arid sub-tropical climates of Gondwana to\ncool temperate rainforest and then cold tundra when Antarctica\nbecame isolated by the opening of the Drake Passage and the\nseparation of the Tasman Rise. Most of these species are now\nextinct on the continent but recent molecular, taxonomic and\nfossil evidence suggests that some species groups have adapted\nto the environmental changes, including chironomid midges,\nmites, copepods, springtails, nematodes, green algae and\ncyanobacteria, many of which have endemic representatives\non the continent (Convey et al. 2008, 2009, Pugh & Convey\n2008).\nThe last million years\nSince the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet, the\ncontinent\u2019s climate has been far from stable. During the\nmost recent geological period, the Quaternary, which spans\napproximately the last 2.6Ma, the polar ice sheets\ndeveloped their characteristic cycle of slow build up to\nfull glacial conditions, followed by rapid deglaciation to\ninterglacial conditions. These broad glacial-interglacial\nchanges in the configuration of the ice sheets are largely\ndriven by the cyclical changes in the Earth\u2019s orbital path\naround the sun controlling the amount of solar radiation\nreaching the Earth (Milankovitch cycles). The most\ninfluential of these are the 41 000 yr obliquity cycle and\nthe 100 000 yr eccentricity cycle, the latter becoming\nparticularly dominant in the late Quaternary (the past\n400 000 years). Warm interglacial phases have lasted\nbetween ,10 000 and 28 000 years, depending on the\ndisposition of the Earth\u2019s orbital parameters at the time, and\ninclude the current period, which has lasted ,11 700 years\nand could be predicted to last at least another 10000 years\n(e.g. see discussion in Berger & Loutre 2003). Antarctic ice\ncore data from glacial cycles over the last 800000 years show\nthat CO2 and mean temperature values have ranged globally\nfrom 180ppm and 108C in glacial periods to 280ppm and\n158C in interglacial periods (EPICA Community Members\n2004). Temperature differences between glacial and\ninterglacial periods in Antarctica in this period averaged\naround 98C. The polar ice sheets expanded to the continental\nshelf edge in glacial periods, causing sea level to drop by\n120m on average (e.g. Clark & Mix 2000). Ice cores from\nboth Antarctica and Greenland show that during the past\n400 000 years interglacial temperatures were between 2\u201358C\nhigher and sea levels were 4\u20136m higher than they are today\n(Severinghaus et al. 1998, Rohling et al. 2008). Correlations\nbased on the similarities seen in Greenland and Antarctic ice\ncore methane signals suggest that climatic events of millennial\nto multi-centennial duration are correlated between the north\nand south polar regions, with Antarctic warm events\ncorrelating with, but preceding, Greenland warm events\n(EPICA Community Members 2006). The data also show a\nstrong relationship between the magnitude of each warming\nevent in the Antarctic and the duration of the warm period that\nfollows each abrupt warming event in Greenland (EPICA\nCommunity Members 2006). The time lag reflects the slow\nspeed of the ocean thermohaline \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 in\ntransferring heat from the Southern Ocean to the Arctic.\nDiatom data from sediment cores show that at the Last\nGlacial Maximum (LGM), ,21 000 years before present,\nAntarctic sea ice was double its current areal extent in both\nwinter and summer (Gersonde et al. 2005). Related sea\nsurface temperature calculations show that both the Polar\nFront and the sub-Antarctic Front shifted to the north\nduring the LGM by between 28 and 108 in latitude from\ntheir present locations (Gersonde et al. 2005).\nThe expansion and contraction of the Antarctic ice sheets\nover these Quaternary glacial cycles undoubtedly led to the\nlocal extinction of terrestrial biological communities on the\nAntarctic continent during glacial periods. Subsequent\ninterglacial recolonization and the resulting present-day\nbiodiversity is a result of whether the species survived the\nglacial maxima in refugia, then recolonized deglaciated\nareas, or arrived through post-glacial dispersal from lower\nlatitude lands that remained ice free, or are present through\na combination of both mechanisms (Convey et al. 2008). In\nthe sea, continuous evolutionary development, both during\nglacial periods in isolated refugia and through repeated\nmigrations from continental shelf to slope and vice versa\ndriven by ice shelf expansion and contraction across the shelf,\nis assumed to be a major driving force explaining the\nrelatively high biodiversity of benthic (bottom-dwelling)\nmarine organisms (Brandt 1991, Clarke & Crame 1997,\nGutt 2006, Convey et al. 2009). Expansions and contractions\nof the sea ice also have had an impact on marine mammal and\nseabird distributions over this period, a feature that has\ncontinued into the Holocene.\nThe Holocene\nThe transition of around 98C from the LGM to the present\ninterglacial period (the Holocene) began,21 000 years ago\nand was complete by ,11 700 years ago. Geological\nevidence from land in the Antarctic shows that\nsubsequently there have been at least two marked warm\nperiods in the Holocene, one between 11 500 and 9000\nyears ago (Masson et al. 2000), and one between 4500 and\n2800 years ago (Bentley et al. 2009). These warmings are\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 545\nsignificantly less than the magnitude of the glacial-\ninterglacial difference, probably no more than 0.58 to 18C\nat most. Some marine records also show evidence of a\nclimate optimum between about 9000 and 3600 years ago\n(Bentley et al. 2009). The ice core record indicates that\nthere were dramatic changes in atmospheric circulation\npatterns around the Antarctic over this period, first at 6000\nyears ago with strengthening and then at 5400\u20135200 years\nago with abrupt weakening of the Southern Hemisphere\nwesterlies; then again around 1200 years ago with re-\nintensification of the westerlies, and the Amundsen Sea\nLow Pressure cell (Mayewski et al. 2004), and more\nrecently from 1700\u20131850 AD when the Antarctic\nexperienced reorganizations in atmospheric circulation\npatterns (Mayewski et al. 2005).\nLinks between the climates of the Northern and Southern\nhemispheres exist but, through most of the Holocene and in the\npreceding ice age, as mentioned above, Northern Hemisphere\nclimate events lagged Southern Hemisphere ones by several\nhundred years (EPICA Community Members 2006, Mayewski\n& Maasch 2006). In contrast, in recent decades the Northern\nHemisphere signal of rising temperature since about 1850 AD\nparalleled that of the Southern Hemisphere - a significant\ndeparture from former times - which suggests the impact of a\nnew and different global forcing, most probably related to\nanthropogenic activity in the form of enhanced greenhouse\ngases (Mayewski & Maasch 2006) which are now present in\nhigher concentrations that at any other time in the Quaternary.\nSynchronicity with Arctic warming continues in the Antarctic\nPeninsula and to a lesser extent in West Antarctica. However,\nover the last 30 years, the temperature changes have been very\ndifferent between the Arctic, where warming continues, and\nEast Antarctica, where there has been little change, perhaps\nlinked with the development of the ozone hole since 1978 (see\nbelow).\nThe instrumental period\nHuman contact with Antarctica is recent in historical terms.\nSporadic expeditions in the first part of the twentieth\ncentury penetrated the interior of the continent but, while\nmany of these included a \u2018scientific\u2019 element, they provided\nno consistent or long-term record of environmental data.\nThe instrumental period began in earnest in the Antarctic\nwith the International Geophysical Year of 1957\/58. This\ninitiated the establishment of permanent and seasonal\nresearch stations, numerically dominated by those located\naround the northern Antarctic Peninsula and South\nShetland Islands, but also spread along the East Antarctic\ncoastline, and with half a dozen stations in the continental\ninterior two of which (Vostok and South Pole) continue to\nthis day. With their establishment, year-round long-term\nobservations commenced and in many cases continue to the\npresent day, supported by several newly added stations on\nthe coast and a few in the interior.\nThe large-scale circulation of the atmosphere\nThe major mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation\nof the high southern latitudes is the Southern Hemisphere\nAnnular Mode (SAM), a circumpolar pattern of atmospheric\nmass displacement (that can be measured by barometers) in\nwhich intensity and location of the gradient of air pressure\nbetween mid-latitudes (high pressure) and the Antarctic coast\n(low pressure) changes in a non-periodic way over a wide\nrange of timescales (Marshall 2003). Over the past 50 years,\nthe SAM has become more positive as pressure dropped\naround the coast of the Antarctic and increased at mid-\nlatitudes. Ice core records suggest that this increase is\nunprecedented during the last 5400 years (Dixon et al. in\nreview). Since the late 1970s this change has manifested as an\nincrease in strength of westerly winds over the Southern\nOcean by 15\u201320%. This recent change in the SAM is linked\nwith both the increase in greenhouse gases and development\nof the Antarctic ozone hole in the austral spring, the latter\nhaving probably the greater influence (Arblaster & Meehl\n2006). At that time of year the loss of stratospheric ozone\ncools the Antarctic stratosphere, so increasing the strength\nof the polar vortex - a large high altitude cyclonic circulation\nthat forms in winter in the middle and upper troposphere\nand stratosphere over the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.\nThis stratospheric cooling is accentuated by the fact that\ngreenhouse-gas-induced global warming warms the\ntroposphere and cools the stratosphere. During the\nsummer and autumn the effects of the ozone hole propagate\ndown through the atmosphere, increasing the atmospheric\ncirculation around Antarctica at lower levels. As a result, the\ngreatest change in the SAM, which is indicative of surface\nconditions, takes place in the summer and autumn. Changes in\nthe SAM between 1958 and 1997 led to a decrease in the\nannual and seasonal numbers of cyclones south of 408S\n(Simmonds et al. 2003). There are now fewer but more\nintense cyclones in the Antarctic coastal zone between 60 and\n708S, except in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea region.\nClimatic changes in the tropics and mid-latitudes can be\ntransmitted to the Antarctic via the atmosphere and the\nocean, with signals of major tropical climate variability\nsuch as the El Nin\u02dco\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being\napparent in ice core data (Meyerson et al. 2002). The South\nPacific sector of the Antarctic has the strongest signals of\nENSO in the atmospheric circulation (Turner 2004), and\nthere appears to be decadal time scale variability in the\nhigh\u2013low latitude links. In recent decades there have been\nmore frequent and more intense El Nin\u02dco events, but there is\nno evidence as yet that this change has affected long term\nclimate trends in the Antarctic.\nAtmospheric temperatures\nSurface temperature trends have shown significant warming\nacross the Antarctic Peninsula and to a lesser extent West\nAntarctica since the early 1950s with, until recently, little\n546 PETER CONVEY et al.\nchange apparent across the rest of the continent (Turner\net al. 2005, Steig et al. 2009). The largest warming trends\nare found on the western and northern parts of the Antarctic\nPeninsula. Faraday\/Vernadsky Station has experienced the\nlargest statistically significant (, 5% level) trend, of\n10.538C per decade over the period 1951\u20132006. The\n100-year record from Orcadas on Laurie Island, South\nOrkney Islands, shows a warming of 10.208C per decade.\nThe western Peninsula warming varies seasonally, and has\nbeen largest during the winter, with winter temperatures at\nFaraday\/Vernadsky increasing by 11.038C per decade\nbetween 1950 and 2006. There is a high correlation during\nthe winter between sea ice extent and surface temperatures,\nsuggesting more sea ice during the 1950s\u20131960s and\nreduction since then (Turner & Overland 2009). At present\nit is unclear whether the winter warming on the western side\nof the Antarctic Peninsula is a result of natural variability or\nsome anthropogenic influence. Temperatures on the eastern\nside of the Antarctic Peninsula have risen most during the\nsummer and autumn (at10.418C per decade from 1946\u20132006\nat Esperanza), linked to the strengthening of the westerlies\nthat took place as the SAM shifted into its positive phase.\nStronger westerly winds bring warm, maritime air masses\nacross the mountainous spine of the Peninsula to the low-lying\nice shelves on the eastern side.\nBased on data from satellites and automated weather\nstations interpolated into regions where there are no such\nstations (such as West Antarctica), West Antarctica as a\nwhole has warmed by about 0.18C per decade, especially in\nwinter and spring (Steig et al. 2009). Ice core data from the\nSiple Dome suggest that this warming began around 1800\n(Mayewski et al. 2005). There have been few statistically\nsignificant changes in surface temperature over the\ninstrumental period elsewhere in Antarctica, although the\nstations around the coast of East Antarctica show a slight\ncooling since 1980 when the ozone hole developed. On the\ncontinental plateau, Amundsen\u2013Scott Station at the South\nPole has shown a slight but statistically significant cooling\nin recent decades, interpreted as being due to fewer\nmaritime air masses penetrating into the interior of the\ncontinent (J. Screen, personal communication 2009). On\nthe other hand, increased penetration of maritime air\nmasses is evident in the Bellingshausen\u2013Amundsen\u2013Ross\nSea regions since ,1940 (Dixon et al. 2004).\nAtmospheric temperatures reconstructed from ice cores\nshow large interannual to decadal variability, with the\ndominant pattern being anti-phase anomalies between the\ncontinent and the Antarctic Peninsula, which is the classic\nsignature of the SAM (Mayewski et al. 2005). These\nstudies suggest that, across Antarctica as a whole,\ntemperatures have increased on average by about 0.28C\nsince the late 19th century.\nAt higher altitudes, Antarctic radiosonde temperature\nprofiles show that the troposphere has warmed at 5 km\nabove sea level, and that the stratosphere above it has\ncooled, over the last 30 years (Turner et al. 2006), a pattern\nthat is an expected consequence of increasing greenhouse\ngases. The Antarctic mid-tropospheric warming in winter is\nthe largest on Earth. It may, in part, be a result of the\ninsulating effect of greater amounts of polar stratospheric\ncloud forming during the winter. These clouds form in\nresponse to stratospheric cooling related also to the ozone\nhole (Lachlan-Cope et al. in press).\nSnowfall\nOn average, about 6mm global sea level equivalent falls as\nsnow on Antarctica each year, with no statistically\nsignificant change apparent since 1957 (Monaghan et al.\n2006). Snowfall trends vary from region to region, for\ninstance increasing on the western side of the Antarctic\nPeninsula, where it may have led to decreases in some\nAde\u00b4lie penguin populations.\nThe Antarctic ozone hole\nStratospheric ozone amounts began to decline in the late\n1970s, following widespread anthropogenic release of\nCFCs and halons into the atmosphere whose products led\nto the destruction of virtually all ozone between heights of\n14 and 22 km over Antarctica each spring (Farman et al.\n1985). Owing to the success of the Montreal Protocol, the\namounts of ozone-depleting substances in the stratosphere\nare now decreasing by about 1% per year. As a result, the\nsize and depth of the ozone hole have stabilized, and the\nozone hole is predicted to recover completely over\napproximately the next century, although no evidence of\nrecovery is apparent at present (Bodeker et al. 2005).\nTerrestrial biology\nThe clearest example of Antarctic terrestrial organisms\nresponding to climate change is given by the two native\nflowering plants (Deschampsia antarctica Desv. and\nColobanthus quitensis (Kunth) Bartl.) in the maritime\nAntarctic, whose populations have increased markedly in\nsize at some sites (Fowbert & Smith 1994, Parnikoza et al.\n2009). Warming encourages the growth and spreading of\nestablished plants and increased establishment of seedlings.\nAnalogous changes are noted anecdotally in the local\ndistribution and development of moss vegetation, which is\nmore typically the dominant vegetation across ice free\nareas in this region, and by implication of the invertebrate\nfaunal communities that they sustain, but robust baseline\nand monitoring studies of these are lacking (Convey 2006).\nChanges in temperature and precipitation have increased\nbiological production in lakes, mainly due to decreases in\nthe duration and extent of lake ice cover (Quayle et al.\n2003, Vincent et al. 2008). Some lakes have become more\nsaline due to drier conditions (Hodgson et al. 2006a).\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 547\nAlien microbes, fungi, plants and animals introduced\nthrough human activity occur on most of the sub-Antarctic\nislands and some parts of the continent (Frenot et al. 2005). In\nsome cases they have seriously impacted the structure and\nfunctioning of native ecosystems and their biota. On Marion\nIsland and Gough Island rates of establishment through\nanthropogenic introduction outweigh those from natural\ncolonization processes by two orders of magnitude or more.\nAntarctic terrestrial ecosystems are thought to be vulnerable\nto the introduction of non-indigenous biota, which may\nprovide new trophic pathways and functions within the\necosystems, and include species with greater competitive\nabilities than native organisms. While introduction events are\na direct consequence of human activity, climate change\nprocesses may act synergistically, lowering the barriers to\nestablishment of these non-indigenous species after their\narrival, and also to the natural long-distance dispersal\nprocesses that have previously protected the continent.\nThe terrestrial cryosphere\nIce shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have changed rapidly\nin recent decades, with warming causing retreat on both\nsides of the Peninsula (Cook et al. 2005). Ice shelf retreat is\nthought to result from increased fracturing via meltwater\ninfilling of pre-existing crevasses, and the influence of\nwarm ocean masses beneath ice shelves. Removal of ice\nshelves has led to the speeding up of inland glacier flow\n(De Angelis & Skvarca 2003, Scambos et al. 2004). Of the\n244 marine glaciers that drain the ice sheet and associated\nislands of the Antarctic Peninsula, 212 (87%) have shown\noverall retreat since 1953, while the remaining 32 glaciers\nhave shown small advances (Cook et al. 2005).\nThere has also been significant reduction in areas\npreviously covered by \u2018permanent\u2019 ice or snow, and some\nislands and other areas of ground are now increasingly snow\nfree during the summer. Glaciers on Heard Island have\nreduced by 11% in area since the 1940s, and several coastal\nlagoons have formed there (Budd 2000). On South Georgia,\n28 of 36 surveyed glaciers are retreating, two are advancing,\nand six are stable (Cook et al. in press). On Signy Island ice\ncover has reduced by around 40% (Smith 1990).\nThe Amundsen Sea sector is the most rapidly changing\nregion of the Antarctic ice sheet. The grounding line at Pine\nIsland has retreated, and the Pine Island Glacier is now\nmoving at speeds 60% higher than in the 1970s (Joughin\net al. 2003, Rignot 2008). The Thwaites Glacier and four\nother glaciers in this sector show accelerated thinning.\nSmith Glacier has increased flow speed by 83% since 1992\n(Thomas et al. 2004). The Pine Island and adjacent glacier\nsystems are currently more than 40% out of balance,\ndischarging 280 \u00b1 9Gt yr-1 of ice, while they receive only\n177 \u00b1 25Gt yr-1 of new snowfall. The current rate of mass\nloss from the Amundsen Sea embayment ranges from 50 to\n137Gt yr-1, equivalent to the current rate of mass loss from\nthe entire Greenland ice sheet, and making a significant\ncontribution to sea level rise (Rignot et al. 2008). These\nchanges result from warming of the sea beneath the ice\nshelves connected to the glaciers, with the stronger winds\nassociated with the more positive SAM resulting in\nupwelling of warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the\ncontinental shelves of the western Antarctic Peninsula and\nAmundsen Sea coasts (Thoma et al. 2008).\nChanges are less dramatic across most of the EAIS, with\nthe most significant changes being seen close to the coast. The\nice sheet shows interior thickening at modest rates and a\nmixture of modest thickening and strong thinning among the\nfringing ice shelves (Davis & Li 2004, Zwally et al. 2006).\nIncreasing coastal melt is also suggested by recent passive\nmicrowave data. Overall, increasing mass loss, dominated by\nchanges in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea\nsector of West Antarctica, outweighs the limited changes\nthroughout much of East Antarctica, increasing the net rate of\nice loss in 2006 to -196 \u00b1 92Gt yr-1, with contributions of\n-60 \u00b1 46Gt yr-1, -132 \u00b1 60Gt yr-1 and -4 \u00b1 61Gt yr-1 from\nthe Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica and East Antarctica,\nrespectively (Rignot et al. 2008).\nSea level changes\nNet ice loss has a direct and immediate effect on sea\nlevel. The 2006 estimate of ice loss rate equates to a\n0.54 \u00b1 0.25mmyr-1 contribution to global sea level rise.\nData from tide gauges and satellite altimeters suggest that,\nover the period 1993\u20132003, global sea level rose at a rate of\nup to 3.1mmyr-1 (see Solomon et al. 2007). The latest\nestimates, for 2003\u201308, based on GRACE space gravimetry\nmeasurements, show that the rate has now slowed to\n2.5mmyr-1 (Cazenave et al. 2009).\nThe Southern Ocean\nThe Southern Ocean is warming and freshening on decadal\ntime scales (Gille 2002) and models suggest that at least\npart of the warming is due to human influence (Fyfe 2006).\nHowever, in surface water layers change is difficult to\ndetect because an intensive seasonal cycle can induce large\nerrors when there are only a few samples. Around South\nGeorgia, observations are available since 1925 that are\nfrequent enough to resolve the annual cycle and reveal a\nsignificant warming averaging 2.38C over 81 years in the\nupper 150m, and being about twice as strong in winter as in\nsummer (Whitehouse et al. 2008). The waters of the ACC\nhave warmed more rapidly than the global ocean as a\nwhole, increasing by 0.068C per decade at depths between\n300 and 1000m over the 1960s to 2000s, and by 0.098C per\ndecade since the 1980s (Bo\u00a8ning et al. 2008). The warming\nhas been more intense on the southern side of the ACC than\nnorth of it, and a maximum increase of 0.178C decade-1 has\nbeen reported in Upper Circumpolar Deep Water at depths\n548 PETER CONVEY et al.\nof 150\u2013500m on the southern side of the Polar Front\n(Bo\u00a8ning et al. 2008).\nThe mechanisms responsible for the warming have not\nbeen determined unambiguously. A poleward shift of the\nACC in response to spatial shifts in the winds has been\npostulated (Gille 2008), as has an increase in the poleward\neddy heat flux associated with an intensification of the\nSouthern Ocean eddy field (Meredith & Hogg 2006, Hogg\net al. 2008). Fyfe (2006) examined these processes in a\ncoupled climate model, and found that both processes\ncontributed, as did increasing air-sea heat fluxes. However,\nthis model had parameterized rather than explicit eddies,\nand further work is needed to clarify the relative roles\nof these and other processes. Despite the large changes\nin temperature and salinity across the ACC, and the\nstrengthening winds over the Southern Ocean, there is no\nevidence for an increase in ACC transport (Bo\u00a8ning et al.\n2008). This is believed to be at least partly due to the extra\nenergy being imparted to the ocean being cascaded to\nmesoscales, and hence intensifying the eddy field rather\nthan the mean flow (Meredith & Hogg 2006).\nWhereas the annular component of the SAM has\nsignificant impact on the ACC, the non-annular component\nis of importance at the regional scale, in particular for the\nWeddell, Ross, Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas\n(Lefebvre et al. 2004). Most closely linked to the ACC is\nthe Bellingshausen Sea, to which the Amundsen Sea is\nconnected through the westward flowing Antarctic Coastal\nCurrent. Ocean summer surface temperatures here have\nincreased by more than 18C in recent years, and summertime\nsalinities have risen markedly (Meredith & King 2005).\nThese changes are not merely the passive responses of the\nocean to changes in the atmosphere and sea ice, but active\nfeedbacks that will enhance and sustain the climate change\nthat triggered them. Observations of subsurface temperatures\nin this area are still scarce, but models indicate that\ntemperature increases in the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water\nbeneath the coastal ice shelves should have significant effects\non the Pine Island Glacier (Payne et al. 2007).\nChanges are evident in the character of Ross Shelf\nWaters, which show a trend of decreasing salinity that is\nmost probably related to upstream conditions in the\nAntarctic Coastal Current (Jacobs et al. 2002). Deep\nwater masses in the Weddell Sea show significant decadal\nand regional change making it difficult to detect long-term\ntrends. Central Weddell Sea bottom water is warming and\nincreasing in salinity over decadal timescales, while bottom\nwater in the western Weddell Sea and the Australian sector\n(including the Ross Sea and Ade\u00b4lie Land) is cooling and\nbecoming fresher (Fahrbach et al. 2004, Rintoul 2007).\nModel results suggest the propagation of anomalies from\nthe Weddell Sea via a deep boundary current into the south-\neast Pacific, linking the circumpolar sectors (Hellmer et al.\n2009). The changes are of interest as AABW originates in\nthese areas and changes here will spread into the world\nocean. There is evidence of warming of the northward flow\nof Antarctic Bottom Water on a decadal timescale in the\nVema Channel between the Argentine and Brazil basins\n(Zenk & Morozov 2007); this warming has now penetrated\nas far northward as the north-west Atlantic (Johnson et al.\n2008).\nBiogeochemistry\nThe Southern Ocean ventilates the global oceans and\nregulates the Earth\u2019s climate system by taking up and\nstoring heat, freshwater, O2 and atmospheric CO2. From\n1991\u20132007 the concentration of CO2 in the ocean increased\nsouth of 208S in the Southern Indian Ocean (Metzl 2009).\nAt latitudes greater than 408S, CO2 in the ocean increased\nfaster than it did in the atmosphere, suggesting that the\nocean became effectively saturated with CO2 and thus less\neffective as a sink for atmospheric CO2. These changes\nagain seem to be linked to the increase in wind strength\ndriven by the more positive SAM.\nThe ocean is alkaline (pH range 7.3 in estuaries to 8.2 in\nthe Arctic Ocean, globally averaging 8 to 8.1) and an\nincrease in the ocean\u2019s CO2 content makes it slightly less so.\nThis has led to concern that the ocean is becoming slightly\nmore acidic, with the implications of this acidification for\norganisms that build their skeletons from calcium carbonate\nbeing a subject of intense current debate but little certainty.\nStronger westerly winds in the Southern Ocean lead to\nsurface oceanic water being mixed with deeper water rich in\nCO2, which saturates the carbon reservoir of the surface\nwater, thus limiting its ability to absorb CO2 from the\natmosphere. The oceans were probably more acid in the\nCretaceous when CO2 levels were much higher than they are\ntoday, without - apparently - any untoward effects on the\ncalcareous marine plankton, such as the coccolithophores\nwhose abundant remains form the White (chalk) Cliffs of\nDover. However, that observation ignores the effect on such\norganisms of the rate of change in ocean acidity and oxygen\nsaturation, about which little is known.\nSea ice\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, ship\nobservations suggest that the extent of sea ice was greater\nthan has been seen in recent decades, although the validity\nof such observations is questioned (Ackley et al. 2003).\nOver recent decades (1979\u20132007), the sea ice extent data\nderived from satellite measurements show a small, but\nstatistically significant positive trend of around 1% per\ndecade (Turner et al. 2009b). The trend is positive in all\nsectors except the Bellingshausen Sea, where sea ice extent\nhas been significantly reduced. The greatest increase, at\naround 4.5% per decade, has been in the Ross Sea. The\nincrease contrasts with the considerable decreases in Arctic\nsea ice observed in recent years, and has been linked to the\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 549\nloss of stratospheric ozone in the Antarctic (Turner et al.\n2009b). The idea is that changes in near surface winds\nassociated with a more positive polarity of the SAM act to\nreduce sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea while\nincreasing it in the Ross Sea. Indeed, winds rather than\ntemperature per se may play a key role in governing sea ice\nabundance in both polar regions.\nInsight over longer time scales can be obtained from a\nclimate model forced to match the observed surface\ntemperature variations by assimilation of the observational\ndata (Goosse et al. 2009). This tuned model can reproduce sea\nice and ocean conditions over the last century and shows the\nincrease of the sea ice area from 1980 to 2000. Prior to 1980,\nand in particular between the early 1960s and the early 1980s,\nthe model simulation showed that the sea ice area decreased.\nThat early decrease in sea ice area corresponded to the one\nsimulated as a response to warming induced by greenhouse\ngas increase, whereas the recent increase in sea ice area is\nrelated to changes in the atmospheric circulation (Goosse\net al. 2009), modulated by the growth of the ozone hole since\nthe late 1970s.\nPermafrost\nIn contrast with the Arctic, there is little information on\npermafrost in the Antarctic. On Signy Island (South Orkney\nIslands) the active layer (the layer experiencing seasonal\nfreeze and thaw) increased in depth by 30 cm from 1963\u201390,\nwhen Signy Island was warming, then decreased by the\nsame amount from 1990\u20132001, when Signy Island cooled\n(Guglielmin et al. 2008; see http:\/\/www.antarctica.ac.uk\/met\/\ngjma\/). In McMurdo Sound, the permafrost temperature at\n360 cm depth has remained stable (Guglielmin 2006), despite\na slight decrease in air temperature of 0.18Cyr-1 over the last\ndecade of the twentieth century (Doran et al. 2002).\nMarine biology\nThe Southern Ocean ecosystem was significantly disturbed by\nwhaling during the early part of the twentieth century, and by\nsealing before that. This means that it is difficult to estimate or\ndescribe the features of the undisturbed, pre-exploitation,\necosystem, or to justify a recent stable \u2018baseline\u2019 against\nwhich to assess contemporary and possible future changes. As\nan example, about 300 000 blue whales were killed within the\nspan of a few decades in the early- to mid-twentieth century,\nequivalent to more than 30 million tonnes of biomass. Most\nwere killed within a 23106 km2 area on their feeding\ngrounds in the south-west Atlantic, which translates to a\ndensity of one blue whale per 6 km2. Following near-\nextinction of some whale populations, the krill stock (their\nprimary food source) was expected to increase due to release\nfrom grazing pressure, but this did not happen (Smetacek &\nNicol 2005). While predation by seals and birds increased,\nthe total bird and seal biomass remains only a fraction of\nthat of the former whale population. It is clear that much\nremains to be learned about the controls of the Southern\nOcean ecosystem.\nOver the past 30 years the Antarctic marine ecosystem has\nbeen significantly affected by climatic changes, especially on\nthe western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, which is currently\nsubject to one of the fastest rates of climate change anywhere\non the planet, with warming water and declining sea ice\n(reviewed in Clarke et al. 2006). Phytoplankton concentrations\nare reported to have unexpectedly decreased in a northern area\nwest of the Antarctic Peninsula, whilst increasing further\nsouth, while in both areas a decrease in sea ice cover had been\nobserved (Montes-Hugo et al. 2009). In the same area the \u2018ice-\ndependent\u2019 Ade\u00b4lie penguins have retreated southwards, to be\nreplaced by \u2018ice-tolerant\u2019 chinstrap penguins (Ducklow et al.\n2007). In contrast to the offshore pelagic system, sea bed\ncommunities and inshore assemblages are locally affected.\nThis has coincided with a decline in krill stocks in the\nentire Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, a large-scale\ndecrease in phytoplankton and a southward shift in the\npopulation of gelatinous salps (Atkinson et al. 2004). The\ndecline in phytoplankton may reflect a decrease in iron\ninput from the continental margin that is, in turn, related to\na reduction in the formation of sea ice in this region and\nhence to climate change (Gregg & Conkright 2002). The\nimportance of sea ice changes are also illustrated by recent\ndeclines in local populations of Pleuragramma antarcticum\nBoulenger, a key fish species in the marine trophic web\nwhose reproduction is closely linked to sea ice, and their\nreplacement by myctophid fish, a new food source for\npredators (Moline et al. 2008).\nMacrobenthic communities have been shown to respond\nsensitively to direct and indirect impacts of natural climate\nchange (Dayton 1989, Gutt & Piepenburg 2003). Climate-\ninduced disintegration of ice shelves and retreat of glaciers\ncause drastic changes in the inshore environmental\nconditions. However, the pelagic system consisting of\nphytoplankton, krill, pelagic fish, seals and whales clearly\nresponds much more rapidly than the benthos (Gutt\npersonal observation). As yet, evidence is unavailable as\nto the potential for invasion of marine organisms onto the\nAntarctic continental shelf due to increasing temperature,\nalthough research effort has increased substantially over\nrecent decades especially in the region west of the Antarctic\nPeninsula most affected by climatic changes. Thus, the\nquestion remains unanswered as to whether a few marine\nspecies with a more northern distribution also occur in the\nAntarctic in very low abundance but have simply not been\nrecorded through lack of sampling, with the continental\nshelf being at the margin of their distribution, or whether\nthey invaded recently. Only standardized long-term data to\nbe made available by databases and information networks\nsuch as SCAR-MarBIN (www.scarmarbin.be), will allow\nthe future detection of any shifts in ecosystem functioning\nand the responses of biodiversity to environmental changes.\n550 PETER CONVEY et al.\nThe next 100 years\nDetermining how the environment of the Antarctic will evolve\nover the next century presents significant challenges yet has\nfundamental implications for scientists, policymakers and the\npublic alike. Climate evolution can most accurately be\nprojected by using coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice models that\nimprove on simple extrapolations of current trends by taking a\nlarge number of parameters into consideration. Current models\nprovide synoptic views of future environmental behaviour,\nalbeit at coarse resolution. Model skill, as measured by ability\nto simulate observed changes, continues to improve but a\nnumber of issues remain, so there remains uncertainty about\ntheir forward projections, particularly at regional scales. The\nmodels used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment (Solomon et al.\n2007) gave a wide range of projections for some aspects of the\nAntarctic climate system, such as sea ice extent, which is\nsensitive to changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions.\nThe models can be weighted according to their skill in\nsimulating recent change. The ACCE report focuses on outputs\nfrom IPCC models that assumed a doubling of CO2 and other\ngases by 2100. These outputs may be too conservative, given\nthat some indicators (e.g. sea level) are already changing faster\nthan predicted in IPCC projections.\nThe importance of high latitude ecosystems as indicators of\npotential biological responses to the various elements of\nenvironmental change processes has been widely highlighted,\nfor instance within the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\n(Chapin et al. 2005). However, numerically based biological\nmodels cannot yet approach the relative sophistication of\nmodels of the physics of the climate system (even with their\ncurrent limitations), while physical models do not approach\nthe level of spatial scale or resolution required for application\nto biological systems, providing an important current\nlimitation on producing testable projections of biotic and\necosystem responses.\nAtmospheric circulation\nThe predicted recovery of the ozone hole may be outweighed\nby a continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, but\nwhether this will result in further strengthening of the positive\nphase of the SAM with a less rapid annual average trend\n(Bracegirdle et al. 2008) has recently become hotly debated.\nThe two causes have now also been shown to have effects at\ndifferent seasons, so further increases in surface winds over\nthe Southern Ocean in the summer and autumn are not\nexpected, but increases in winter are expected.\nTemperature\nModels project significant surface warming over Antarctica\nto 2100 AD, by 0.348C per decade over land and the\ngrounded ice sheets, within a range from 0.14 to 0.508C per\ndecade (Bracegirdle et al. 2008). Over land, the largest\nincrease is projected for the high altitude interior of East\nAntarctica. Despite this change, the surface temperature by\nthe year 2100 will remain well below freezing over most of\nAntarctica and will not contribute to melting inland. The\nlargest atmospheric warming is projected to occur over the\nsea ice zone in winter (0.51 \u00b1 0.268C per decade off East\nAntarctica), because of the retreat of the sea ice edge and\nthe consequent exposure of the ocean. However, while\nthere is confidence in the overall projection of warming,\nconfidence is much lower in the regional detail, because of\nthe large differences in regional outcomes between models.\nFurthermore, twentieth century Antarctic near-surface air\ntemperature trends in the models are up to five times larger\nthan was observed, and resolving the relative contributions of\ndynamic and radiative forcing on Antarctic temperature\nvariability in models is necessary to improve twenty-first\ncentury projections (Monaghan et al. 2008). The annual mean\nwarming rate in the troposphere at 5 km above sea level is\nprojected to be 0.288C per decade (T. Bracegirdle, personal\ncommunication 2009), somewhat less than the forecast\nsurface warming. As yet we cannot forecast either the\nmagnitude or frequency of changes to extreme conditions\nover Antarctica - features that are of fundamental importance\nin refining biological projections of potential impacts.\nHowever, the extreme temperature range between the\ncoldest and warmest temperature of a given year is\nprojected to decrease around the coasts and to show little\nchange over the interior (T. Bracegirdle, personal\ncommunication 2009).\nThe projected warming of 38C over the next century is\nfaster than the fastest previous rate of rise recorded in\nAntarctic ice cores (48C 1000 yr-1), but it is comparable to\nor slower than the rates of temperature rise typical of\nDansgaard-Oeschger events during glacial times in\nGreenland, of the Bolling-Aller\u00f8d warming in Greenland\n14 700 years ago, and of the warming in Greenland at the\nend of the Younger Dryas around 11 700 years ago. Thus,\nhowever unlikely such rapidity may appear, there are some\nprevious parallels in the natural system.\nPrecipitation\nCurrent numerical models generally underestimate\nprecipitation for the twentieth century. This is due to\nproblems in parameterizing key processes that drive\nprecipitation (e.g. because polar cloud microphysics is\npoorly understood), and because the smooth coastal\nescarpment in a coarse resolution model causes cyclones\nto precipitate less than they do in reality. Warmer air\ntemperatures and associated higher atmospheric moisture in\nmost models are expected to give net precipitation\nincreases in the future. Most climate models simulate a\nprecipitation increase over Antarctica in the coming\ncentury that is larger in winter than in summer, and\nmodel outputs suggest that the snowfall over the continent\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 551\nmay increase by 20% compared to current values\n(Bracegirdle et al. 2008). With the expected southward\nmovement of the mid-latitude storm track we can expect\ngreater precipitation and accumulation in the Antarctic\ncoastal region. The form that precipitation takes is of\nbiological significance (Convey 2006), as liquid water is\nimmediately available to biota, with the balance between\nrain and snow expected to change towards the former,\nespecially along the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThe ozone hole\nBy the middle of the 21st century springtime concentrations\nof stratospheric ozone are predicted to have significantly\nrecovered, but not necessarily to 1980 values (Turner et al.\n2009b). This is because increasing greenhouses gases will\nhave continued to accumulate throughout the atmosphere, so\nfurther cooling the stratosphere. The gas-phase destruction of\nozone that occurs at all latitudes will be reduced in a colder\nstratosphere, but is likely to be enhanced in polar regions\nwhere the cooling leads to the formation of polar stratospheric\nclouds on the surface of which the reactions take place that\nlead to polar ozone destruction.\nTropospheric chemistry\nVarious trace gases, such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS)\ngenerated by plankton, are released from the oceans around\nAntarctica. DMS is a source of cloud condensation nuclei\n(CCN) via its oxidation to sulphate. Evidence from ice\ncores suggests that DMS increased during glacial periods\n(Legrand et al. 1991), although the pattern in ice cores\ncould also reflect changes in wind strength and direction\nrather than in DMS production. Given a projected loss of\nsea ice in a warmer world, emissions of gases such as DMS\nmight be expected to increase, thus increasing the number\nof CCN and hence increasing cloudiness and albedo, and\ninfluencing the Earth\u2019s climate. However, the extent to\nwhich we may see an increase or a decrease in DMS\nremains debateable. Similarly, recent studies of the\nproduction of ozone-depleting bromocarbon gases in\nnear-shore Antarctic waters are highlighting the complex\nrelationships between changing sea ice extent, the summer\nalgal bloom, and sea-to-air flux of gases (Hughes et al.\n2009, Montes-Hugo et al. 2009).\nTerrestrial biology\nIncreased temperatures may promote activity, growth and\nreproduction, but also cause drought and associated effects\n(Convey 2006). Changes to water availability can have a\ngreater effect than temperature on vegetation and faunal\ndynamics. Future regional patterns of water availability are\nunclear, but - as described above - climate models project\nan increase in precipitation in coastal regions. Interactions\nbetween environmental variables (e.g. temperature and water)\nare also important to biota - for instance, an increase in the\nfrequency and intensity of freeze-thaw events could readily\nexceed the tolerance limits of many arthropods. With\nincreases in temperature, many terrestrial species may\nexhibit faster metabolic rates, shorter life cycles and local\nexpansion of populations. Even subtle changes in temperature,\nprecipitation and wind speed will probably alter the catchment\nof lakes, and of the timing, depth and extent of their surface\nice cover, water volume and chemistry, with resulting effects\non lake ecosystems (Quesada et al. 2006, Lyons et al. 2006,\nHodgson & Smol 2008). Warming and\/or reductions in other\nenvironmental stresses also increase the likelihood of invasion\nby more competitive alien species carried by water and air\ncurrents, humans and other animals (Frenot et al. 2005).\nThe terrestrial cryosphere\nExisting ice sheet models do not properly reproduce the\nobserved behaviour of ice sheets, casting doubt on their\npredictive value (Solomon et al. 2007). The models fail to\ntake into account mechanical degradation (e.g. water causing\ncracks to propagate in summer), changing lubrication of the\nbase of the ice by an evolving subglacial hydrological regime,\nor the influence of variable coastal sub-ice shelf melting on\nthe flow of outlet glaciers and ice streams. Projections of the\nfuture state of ice sheets are based on a combination of\ninference from past behaviour, extension of current behaviour,\nand interpretation of proxy data and analogues from the\ngeological record. The projections rely on continued data\nstreams from satellites and field observations, which are\ncrucial to quantifying the rapid rates of cryospheric change.\nWithout these two components, models will remain unable\nto provide credible projections of the future of the Antarctic\nice sheet.\nUntil these needs are met, it can best be said that the most\nprobable regions of future change are those that are already\nchanging today. Warmer waters will continue to well up onto\nthe continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea, eroding the\nunderside of the ice sheets and glaciers. It has been suggested\nthat there is a 30% probability that loss of ice from the WAIS\ncould cause sea level to rise at a rate of 2mmyr-1, and a 5%\nprobability it could cause rates of 1 cmyr-1 (Vaughan &\nSpouge 2002). In addition, there is a concern that the ice in\nthe Amundsen Sea Embayment could be entering a phase of\ncollapse that could lead to deglaciation of large parts of the\nWAIS (Pollard & Deconto 2009).\nUltimately, this sector could contribute 1.5m to global\nsea level, so a contribution from this sector alone of some\ntens of centimetres by 2100 cannot be discounted. These\nestimates are based upon the assumption that the ice sheets\nwill respond linearly to warming and that sea level\ncontributions will be confined to the WAIS. Evidence for\npast abrupt changes in climate suggests that these estimates\ncould change significantly. Expansion of the area to include\n552 PETER CONVEY et al.\nall marine-based regions and upflow regions of both the\nWest and East Antarctic ice sheets currently stabilized by\nthese marine-based regions could also raise these estimates\nsignificantly.\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula, most of the effects leading to\nloss of ice are currently confined to the northern part. The total\nvolume of ice on the Peninsula is 95200km3, equivalent to\n242mm of sea level rise or roughly half that of all glaciers and\nice caps outside of Greenland and Antarctica (Pritchard &\nVaughan 2007). Continued warming in this region will lead to\na southerly progression of ice shelf disintegrations along both\ncoasts (Vaughan & Doake 1996, Hodgson et al. 2006b), which\nwill also cause associated glaciers to speed up. These events\nmay be preceded by an increase in surface meltwater lakes,\nand\/or progressive retreat of the calving front. Prediction of the\ntiming of ice shelf disintegration is not yet possible. However,\nincreased warming may lead to the Peninsula making a\nsubstantial contribution to global sea level.\nPermafrost\nIt is probable that there will be a reduction in permafrost\narea, accompanied by subsidence of ground surface and\nassociated mass movements. Change is most likely in the\nnorthern Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland and\nSouth Orkney Islands and coastal areas in East Antarctica.\nSuch changes imply risks to infrastructure as already seen\nin the Arctic, although this is likely to have limited impact\nin the Antarctic.\nSea level\nThe IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) projected a\nrange of global sea-level increase from 18 to 59 cm between\n1980\u201399 and 2090\u201399 (Meehl et al. 2007). This did not\ninclude a contribution from dynamically driven changes in\nflow for portions of either the Greenland or Antarctic ice\nsheets. Sea level will not rise uniformly, and the spatial pattern\nof projections shows a minimum rise in the Southern Ocean\nand a maximum in the Arctic Ocean (Meehl et al. 2007). The\nlast time global temperatures rose by 28C (during the Eemian,\n,130000 years ago) sea level rose at least 4\u20136m. Recent\nmodelling suggests that a likely upper bound to sea level by\n2100 is 1.4m (Rahmstorf 2007). However, projected sea level\nincreases (Solomon et al. 2007) do not include possibly large\ncontributions resulting from the dynamic instability of ice\nsheets during the twenty-first century. Taking such variables\ninto consideration, Pfeffer et al. (2008) estimate an upper\nbound of 2m of sea level rise by 2100.\nThe ocean circulation and water masses\nEstimates of the ocean circulation and water mass changes\nduring the 21st century are derived from the Coupled\nGeneral Circulation Models (CGCMs) that were used in the\nframework of the IPCC AR4. Although such models have\nmade significant progress in their representation of high\nlatitude processes in comparison with earlier model versions\n(Randall et al. 2007), the Southern Ocean remains one of\nthe regions where the largest differences between different\nmodels (and between models and observations) are apparent.\nOnly two models among the nineteen analysed by Russell\net al. (2006a) generate transport values for the ACC that are\nwithin 20% of those estimated from observation (135 Sv),\nalthough most of the simulated values are within 50 Sv of this\nestimate. These clear inaccuracies have been attributed to\nmodels incorporating too low a zonal wind stress, locating the\nmaximum winds in the Southern Ocean too far north, or errors\nin the simulation of the ocean density gradient, partly due to\nproblems in estimating the export of North Atlantic Deep\nWater (NADW) (Russell et al. 2006a). An important factor is\nthat the current generation of IPCC coupled climate models\ndo not include eddy-resolving oceans, and these sub-\ngrid-scale features are of great importance in controlling the\nresponse of the Southern Ocean to changing forcing, and it\ndictating the magnitude and extent of oceanic climate change.\nWhen the temperature and salinity averaged over all the\nmodels is compared to observations, the zonal mean\ndifferences are relatively small. There is a tendency to have\ntoo warm and too salty water masses around 30\u2013408S in the\ndepth range 500\u20131000m (Randall et al. 2007), which could be\nrelated to the site of formation of Antarctic intermediate\nwaters (AAIW) being placed too far north in these models.\nFurther insight comes from an observational study\nsuggesting that the ACC transport has not shown sensitivity\nto the intensification of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies\nduring the past several decades (Bo\u00a8ning et al. 2008).\nHowever, the sub-polar gyres will be intensified (Wang &\nMeredith 2008), since the wind forcing over the sub-polar\nregion becomes more cyclonic, as a consequence of the\nintensification and southward shift of the circumpolar\nwesterlies. The strengthening of the sub-polar gyres will\nprobably have strong impacts on the mass balance of ice\nshelves and the stability of the Antarctic ice sheets, and could\nalso impact strongly on the transformations of water masses\nwithin the sub-polar gyres and the export of dense deep waters\nto lower latitudes.\nChanges in ocean temperature and salinity over the\ncentury have been derived as the average over the ensemble\nof 19 IPCC AR4 models. The changes of sea surface\ntemperature (SST) are small compared with those observed\nin surface air temperature, because of the larger heat\ncapacity of the ocean in comparison with the atmosphere.\nSouth of 608S in summer the SSTs are likely to be\n0.58\u20131.08C warmer, except in the Amundsen Sea where\nwarming of 1.0\u20131.258C is expected. In winter little change\nis expected south of 608S except far offshore off Dronning\nMaud Land, West Antarctica and Queen Mary Land, where\nSST may warm by 1.08C. The surface waters will become\nfresher by 0.1 to 0.2 salinity units, with some local patches\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 553\nup to 0.3 units fresher, for instance in the Weddell Sea and\nin the Ross Sea off Oates Land. On the continental shelf the\nbottom water temperatures at 200m are predicted to be\nwarmer by 0.58C to 0.758C and up to 0.1 units fresher,\nexcept in the Weddell Sea where the warming will be less\n(between 08C and 0.58C) and the freshening stronger. The\nsurface layers affected by this warming are quite shallow,\nextending over less than 200m, and the freshening is\nrestricted to depths above 400m. The bottom waters along\nthe continental margin to a depth of 4000m are predicted to\nwarm during the whole year by around 0.258C. The\naccuracy of these projected values is in doubt as ocean\nmodels deal rather poorly with continental shelf processes;\nnevertheless in the Antarctic context it does not seem\nunreasonable to suppose that shelf temperatures will be\nfairly similar to those of the adjacent open ocean, and we\nhave assumed this to be the case.\nAccepting current weaknesses in modelling of the ACC,\nbest estimates currently suggest that there will be significant\nwarming (0.758C to almost 28C in all seasons) at the surface\nbetween 40 and 608S, in the core regions of the Antarctic\nCircumpolar Current, and that surface waters will be fresher\nthan at present by up to almost 0.2 units at the surface\nbetween the coast and about 458S, including the Antarctic\nIntermediate Water, which will be slightly fresher.\nThe vertical stratification will increase as a result of the\nsurface density decrease. In consequence the ocean\nventilation and in particular the formation of Antarctic\nBottom Water decreases in many models, although the\nmagnitude of the changes in AABW is strongly variable\nfrom model to model, and coarse-resolution climate models\ndo not typically represent the AABW formation processes\nin a realistic way (e.g. Manabe et al. 1991, Manabe &\nStouffer 1993, Hirst 1999, Bates et al. 2005, Bitz et al.\n2006, Bryan et al. 2006). However, increased wind stresses\ncould compensate for increased stratification and result in a\ndeeper mixed layer in some areas. The decrease in sea ice\nextent could induce stronger cooling in winter that may\nlead to stronger mixing at the new ice edge. Shifts in\nconvection patterns have also been noticed, with decreased\nmixing in some areas but increases in others (e.g. Bitz et al.\n2006, Conil & Mene\u00b4ndez 2006). Ocean ventilation could be\nenhanced because of the surface divergence induced by the\nincrease in wind stress projected during the 21st century.\nRussell et al. (2006b) argue that this effect could be\nsignificantly underestimated in some models because of\nwesterlies located too far north in the control climate.\nSea ice\nThe average of the modelled sea ice extent compares well\nwith observations, although there is a large inter-model\nspread (Arzel et al. 2006, Parkinson et al. 2006). The\nmodels show that over the 21st century the annual average\ntotal sea ice area is projected to decrease by 2.63 106 km2,\nor 33% (Bracegirdle et al. 2008). On the regional scale,\ndecreases are less significant (Lefebvre & Goosse 2008).\nWhereas in the 20th century the strongest decrease was\nfound around the Antarctic Peninsula, the maximum\ndecrease in the 21st century is predicted to be in the\ncentral Weddell Sea and the Bellingshausen\u2013Amundsen\nseas. Most of the simulated ice retreat occurs in winter and\nspring when the sea ice extent is largest, so will decrease\nthe amplitude of the seasonal cycle. Less sea ice means less\nbrine rejection, and hence less formation of dense surface\nwater. In the regions where sea ice currently remains\npresent throughout the summer, in particular the Weddell\nSea, large reductions of sea ice extent are projected.\nBiogeochemistry\nModel projections suggest that the Southern Ocean will be\nan increased sink of atmospheric CO2 (Russell et al. 2006b)\ndue to a larger outcrop area of the dense water around\nAntarctica. However, the increased outgassing of natural\nCO2 due to increased upwelling of deep water leads in the\nopposite direction, resulting in a saturation of the CO2 sink\n(Le Que\u00b4re\u00b4 et al. 2007). The magnitude of the uptake of CO2\nfrom the air by the ocean will depend on how the ocean\nresponds to increases in ocean warming and stratification,\nwhich can drive both increases in CO2 uptake through\nbiological and export changes, and decreases through\nsolubility and density changes.\nIf surface ocean pH levels become less alkaline (more\nacid) by 0.2\u20130.3 units from the average level of around pH\n8\u20138.1 by 2100 AD it seems possible that there could be some\nthinning of the aragonite skeletons of the pteropods that are\nan important part of the plankton at the base of the food\nchain (Orr et al. 2005). The Southern Ocean is at higher risk\nfrom this than other oceans because it has low saturation\nlevels of CaCO3 and, already, one study has shown that the\nshell weights of the modern foraminifer Globigerina\nbulloides d\u2019Orbigny collected from sediment traps in the\nSouthern Ocean were 30\u201335% lower than those from\nunderlying Holocene-aged sediments (Moy et al. 2009).\nMarine biology\nMost evidence pertaining to how marine benthic organisms\nmay cope with temperature rise is experimental. Being\ntypically \u2018stenothermal\u2019 (able only to live within a limited\nrange of temperature, contrasting with \u2018eurythermal\u2019\norganisms that can maintain function across a wide range\nof temperatures) is a key trait of many Antarctic marine\nanimals (Peck et al. 2006). If they are truly so limited they\nwould be highly sensitive to significant environmental\nwarming. Laboratory experiments show that most species\ninvestigated have upper lethal temperatures below 108C,\nsome can survive just a 58C change, and some critical\nbiological activities become compromised at temperatures\n554 PETER CONVEY et al.\nas low as 128C in some species. It should be noted that most\nof the species studied to date have been obtained from shallow\nwater because this is most practicable to sample and animals\ncollected there can easily be kept alive. There is thus a\npossibility that they are not as stenothermal as the many not so\nwell studied species that inhabit the deeper shelf. However,\ntemperature increases of this magnitude in the Southern\nOcean are extremely unlikely by 2100 AD, while there remains\na fundamental mismatch between even the slowest rates of\nwarming that can be achieved in experimental scenarios, and\nthose currently being experienced in the natural environment.\nOn even longer, evolutionary, timescales it is clear that\nbiological compensation is possible, for instance with certain\ntaxa occurring on both sub-Antarctic South Georgia and the\nAntarctic Peninsula even though sea temperatures around the\nformer are higher than those tolerated experimentally by\nanimals collected from the latter. That being said, vital\nfunctions of organisms can be affected at lower temperatures\nwell before lethal levels are reached, and whether populations\nor species will survive future temperature rises may be\ndictated by their ability to carry out critical activities such as\nfeeding, swimming and reproduction (Peck et al. 2006).\nModel projections suggest that bottom water temperatures\non the continental shelf are likely to be warmer by between\n0.5 and 0.758C by 2100 AD, except in the Weddell Sea where\nthe warming is likely to be less. This suggests that the effects\nof warming on the marine biota may be less than has been\nimplied from laboratory experiments, at least over this\ntimescale. Projected warming greater than 1.58C is restricted\nto the surface waters near the core of the ACC.\nRecent studies of long-lived and sub-fossil deep sea corals\non seamounts south of Australia have suggested that die-back\nevents over time may reflect changes in the formation of\nAntarctic Intermediate Waters and therefore be indicators of\nlong-term (century-scale) variability in water temperatures at\ndepth related to large-scale water mass changes (Thresher\nunpublished). Such studies highlight the linkage between\nAntarctic climate, variability in Southern Ocean circulation,\nand biology at lower latitudes.\nIf sea ice cover continues to decrease, marine ice algae\nwill begin to disappear due to loss of habitat, which may\ncause a cascade through higher trophic levels in the food\nweb. Given a complete removal of sea ice we might expect\nextinction of those species that presently depend on it for\nsurvival, including krill, some fish, penguins, seals and\nwhales and, consequently, a complete collapse of the entire\npelagic system cannot be ruled out. Climate models suggest\nthat complete removal is unlikely within the next 100 years,\nand indeed it does not seem to have been removed\ncompletely during previous interglacials. With the decline\nin sea ice there will also be changes in the pelagic algal\nblooms supplying food to benthic organisms on the\ncontinental shelf (Montes-Hugo et al. 2009). If this\nresults in an increase in biological detritus on the shelf\nthis may cause a decline in suspension feeders adapted to\nlimited food supplies, and to their associated fauna. When\nice shelves collapse, the changes from a unique ice shelf-\ncovered ecosystem to a typical Antarctic shelf ecosystem,\nwith high primary production during a short summer, are\nlikely to be among the largest ecosystem changes on the\nplanet.\nGiven the slow rates of growth and high degree of\nendemism (species only occurring in the region) in Antarctic\nspecies, continued ocean warming and expanded tourism\nand scientific activity may lead to the wider establishment\nof non-indigenous species by 2100, as also predicted in\nthe terrestrial environment, and consequent reduction or\nextinction of some locally endemic species (Frenot et al.\n2005, Tin et al. 2009). Invasion by new species will\nprobably remain restricted to isolated areas where invaders\ncan survive at their physiological limits. As yet it is unclear\nif the finding of a very small number of non-indigenous\nmacroalgae and invertebrate animals represent rare\noccurrences (with or without human assistance) at their\nnatural southern distribution limits, or the first stages of a\nmarine biogeographical shift induced by warming.\nAcute agents of disturbance to marine biota and\necosystems associated with environmental change include\n(Barnes & Peck 2008): 1) increased ice-loading and coastal\nconcentrations of large icebergs resulting from ice shelf\ncollapse, leading to greater impacts from ice scour, 2)\nincreased coastal sedimentation associated with ice melt,\nsmothering benthos and hindering feeding, 3) freshening of\nsurface waters leading to stratification of the water column,\nand (4) thermal events such as those associated with ENSO\nevents. At longer timescales, chronic impacts of climate\nchange include: 1) ice shelf disintegration, exposing new\nhabitats, 2) decreases in ice scour by icebergs, leading to\nincreased local but decreased regional biodiversity, 3) the\nphysiological consequences of warming, leading to reduced\nperformance of critical activities and thus geographic and\nbathymetric migration, 4) benthic responses to changes in\nthe pelagic system, especially in the food web, 5) increased\nacidification, leading to skeletal synthesis and maintenance\nproblems, and 6) slight deoxygenation of surface waters,\nultimately leading to more serious deoxygenation in deeper\nlayers. The absence of wide latitudinal and environmental\ngradients around the Antarctic continent minimizes the\nadvantage of migration for survival.\nSpecies such as fur seals are likely to respond most to\nchanges in extreme climate events, for instance caused by\nchanges in the ENSO. Emperor penguins and other ice-\ndependent species depend on the sea ice habitat to complete\ntheir life cycle. A significant decline in sea ice is likely to\naffect their populations, and may lead to progressive\nregional displacement by species emigrating from more\nnorthern (including Antarctic) latitudes. A biogeographic\nshift of a variety of species must have been common during\npast changes between glacial and interglacial periods, some\nof which were typically rapid and extreme events of\nANTARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT 555\ncomparable magnitude to that which is occurring today.\nIndeed, several shifts in species distribution have occurred\nin the Holocene (e.g. Emslie & Woehler 2005, Hall et al.\n2006). Based on numerical and conceptual models, the most\nsignificant changes in the marine biota are expected for\nthe sub-Antarctic pelagic system and sea ice related\ncommunities. Ocean acidification is likely to be the most\nsevere CO2-related impact for both pelagic and benthic\ncommunities where these are dominated by calcifying\norganisms.\nBaleen whales are a key component of the Antarctic marine\necosystem, but are currently at only fractions of their historical\nabundances and contemporary data show that different species\npopulations are recovering at different rates, with conclusions\nlimited by the availability of long-term datasets (Leaper et al.\n2008). Interpretation of the responses of baleen whale\npopulations to climate change is therefore difficult to\ndisentangle from the effects of exploitation. In the long\nterm, given that some species such as the blue whale are only\npossibly in the early stages of recovery, climate change\nimpacts, most likely mediated through changes in sea ice\ndynamics that alter habitat characteristics and changes in prey\nabundance and distribution, will almost certainly negatively\naffect recovery potential. In the short-term, direct effects of\ntemperature increases on baleen whales are unlikely because\nof their mobility and thermoregulatory ability. As ocean\nproductivity shifts with changes in sea ice extent, more\nnortherly (oceanic) species such as fin whales may track\nchanging prey availability and expand their range south,\noverlapping spatially with blue and minke whales. Prey\navailability, itself correlated with changes in ocean climate\n(Trathan et al. 2006), may also have direct effects on whale\ndemography, as has been demonstrated for southern right\nwhales (Leaper et al. 2006). The fact that baleen whales\ndepend upon the availability of the suitable habitat in multiple\nlocations (i.e. not just Antarctica), may also compound their\nvulnerability to climate change, as these different locations\nmay be subject to different impacts.\nIn both the marine and terrestrial Antarctic environments it\nis unlikely that many species will become extinct by 2100,\nexcept on a local population scale. Studies of biodiversity,\ncoupled to sound data handling and dissemination, will bring\na better understanding of how life has evolved in these\nenvironments, and to what extent it can potentially respond\nto change. A key contemporary challenge to the research\ncommunity is to incorporate physiological\/ biochemical\napproaches into the field of evolutionary biology and\necology, taking advantage of the power of genomic and\nother \u2018omic\u2019 technologies. Important targets include identifying\nlinks between tectonics, climate evolution, glacial processes\nand biotic evolution, between the physical environment and\ngene flow, and with northern polar studies. Bridges between\ndifferent disciplines and international programmes will provide\na legacy of knowledge for future generations in the form of\na comprehensive information system.\nConcluding remarks\nThe climate of the high latitude areas is more variable than\nthat of tropical or mid-latitude regions and has experienced a\nhuge range of conditions over the last few million years. The\nsnapshot we have of the climate during the instrumental\nperiod is tiny in the long history of the continent, and large\ngaps due to the limited coverage by in situ observations in\nspace and time still exist. Therefore the separation of natural\nclimate variability from anthropogenic influences remains a\nchallenge. However, the effects of increased greenhouse gas\nlevels and decreases in stratospheric ozone are already\nevident. The effects of the predicted increase in greenhouses\ngases over the next century will be remarkable because of\ntheir speed. Removal of the cooling effect of the ozone hole\nas it diminishes in extent will exacerbate the problem. It is\nclear that the degree to which the Earth\u2019s climate will change\nover the next century is also fundamentally dependent on the\nsuccess of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To be\nable to document and diagnose the ongoing changes in situ\nobservation systems have to be established, completed or\nmaintained for the atmosphere, the ice and the ocean.\nThe instrumental period has seen accelerating data\ncollection culminating in the recognition of astonishingly\nrapid physical changes. These achievements have been\nfuelled primarily by the development of an array of\nextraordinarily capable satellite sensors. The availability of\nthese data for research has been enhanced through a variety\nof data sharing agreements, further increasing their value, and\nthe research community has become increasingly reliant on\ntheir existence and availability. However, the continuation of\nthese exceptional resources cannot be taken for granted and\nmany of the most valuable sensors are already beyond their\ndesign lifetime, with replacement missions either not planned\nor planned for launches so far in the future that prolonged\ngaps in coverage are probable. These gaps must be\nminimized and, if possible, eliminated. The prospect of, for\ninstance, slowly going blind to ice sheets at precisely the\nmoment when their behaviour has suddenly become very\ndramatic carries with it the undesirable consequences that,\nnot only will we not be able to follow the continuing\nevolution of areas already changing dramatically, but we will\nnot be able to detect new areas of change at an early stage,\nlimiting our ability to understand the causes of these changes.\nRecommendations for satellite observations of the cryosphere\nare given in the Cryosphere Theme document produced for\nthe Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) Partnership\n(http:\/\/www.eohandbook.com\/igosp\/cryosphere.htm).\nWe can make reasonably broad estimates of how\nvariables such as temperature, precipitation and sea ice\nextent might change, and consider possible generic impacts\non marine and terrestrial biota. However, the coarse scale at\nwhich physical modelling activities can currently take\nplace provides limited biological relevance, and increasing\nthe horizontal resolution achievable will be central to\n556 PETER CONVEY et al.\nintegration of the predictions of physical and biological\ndisciplines. We cannot yet say with confidence how the\nlarge ice sheets of Antarctica will respond, but observed\nrecent rapid changes give cause for concern - especially for\nthe stability of parts of West Antarctica.\nMarine and terrestrial biologists need more information\nfrom ecological, physiological and genomic studies about the\nsensitivity of ecological key species, along with more\ninformation on the geography of the hot- and cold-spots of\nAntarctic biodiversity and their ecosystem functioning, and\nidentification of the main biological and physical driving\nforces. These challenges should provide the basis for further\ndevelopment of spatially explicit numerical simulations of the\nstate-of-the-art of the Antarctic ecosystem, and extrapolations\nfrom this - with the support of, or in combination with results\nfrom physical models - into the future, using various climate\nscenarios.\nReferences\nACKLEY, S.F., WADHAMS, P., COMISO, J. & WORBY, A. 2003.
