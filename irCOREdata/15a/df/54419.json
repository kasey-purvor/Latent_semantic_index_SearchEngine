Introduction \n \nThe deprivation of behavioural or ethological needs is a key feature of poor welfare of animals \nkept in captivity (see Dawkins 1988; Friend, 1989; Rushen et al., 1993). Animals have a certain \ndegree of plasticity to adapt their behavioural repertoire to environmental demands, in which case, \nhey can acquire new behaviours (learning), omit non-adaptive behaviours or adapt behavioural \nstrategies to available resources. However, where behavioural plasticity is limited and the animal \nis equipped with pre-programmed specific behavioural strategies (\"standard answers\") to cope \nwith \u201cstandard\u201d demands of the environment to which the species has been adapted during \nevolution, the capacity to adapt to captive animals may be restricted (see for coping strategies: \ne.g. Fokkema et al., 1995; Koolhaas et al., 1999). \n The role of swimming water for farmed mink has elicited much debate with respect to \nscientific and the societal concerns regarding animal welfare and related ethical issues associated \nwith this agriculture activity in some European countries.Whether access to swimming water \nrepresents a behavioural need for farmed mink, thus far has not been resolved conclusively. \nTherefore, a concerted action of a combined set of studies was launched to attempt to resolve this \nissue: Is swimming water an indispensable stimulus, a conditional need, or is swimming water no \nneed at all for farmed mink?  \n This paper aims to discuss the main results and conclusions of these studies (the separate \nfull studies are published elsewhere) as well as other available literature on the meaning of \nswimming water for farmed mink. Attention is paid to the effects of the presence, the absence and \nthe removal of swimming water (deprivation) on stereotypic behaviour, anticipatory activity, levels \nof urinary cortisol, individual differences in use of water resources, preference and consumer \ndemand studies, and the effect of swimming water on juvenile play as a potential positive indicator \nof animal well being. The present paper does not address animal management issues  such as \nthe economic consequences of the introduction of swimming water on farms, the potential \nlegislation to cover swimming water delivery in different countries, or the effect of swimming water \non reproduction, pelt quality and health. Nor does this paper discuss the ethical aspects on the \npurpose wherefore mink is commercially bred. \n \n The paper starts with a short summary on the concept of behavioural needs, followed by \nminks\u2019 natural habitats on land and water, and the use swimming behaviour by captive mink.. \nSubsequently, we discuss: the development of stereotypies in farmed mink in the presence and \nabsence of swimming water; consumer-demand tests and substitutability of alternative resources; \nthe importance of prior experience with swimming water; anticipatory and juvenile play behaviour \nin the presence and absence of a water bath; and the effects of deprivation and  challenges \ninvolved in the study of behavioural deprivation. Finally, we question why mink might be motivated \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 5\n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \nto have swimming water, draw conclusions on the necessity of providing swimming water to \nfarmed mink, and provide advice for future research and for farming practice. \n \n2.  Behavioural needs and reward \n \nBehavioural needs: definitions, concepts and some characteristics \nBehavioural needs or \u201cwhat is indispensable to an animal\u201d, have been described in various ways. \nOne approach is to reflect on the wild or natural environment and suggest all elements animals \nthat are denied in captivity can be described as lacking or deprived (Thorpe, 1965; Martin, 1979). \nThis approach has been largely rejected by animal welfare scientist, citing the organism\u2019s \nbehavioural plasticity and the effects of domestication and humans\u2019 selective breeding programs \n(e.g. Dawkins, 1980, 1983; Poole, 1992; Veasey et al., 1996 Price, 1999) who concluded that it \nwould be inappropriate to assume captive animals would require the same elements in their \nenvironment as their wild conspecifics. \n   \nA more classical definition of behavioural needs can be found in \u201cWho needs behavioural \nneeds?\u201d by Jensen and Toates (1993). They defined a behavioural need as a specific behavioural \npattern that should be performed, irrespective of the environment, even when the physiological \nneeds related to this essential behaviour have been met.  The biological relevance or adaptive \nvalue of performance of these types of behaviours may reside in long-term benefits for the \nindividual or its offspring (e.g. behaviours concerning reproduction, foraging and grooming). It is \noften assumed that the motivation to perform these essential behavioural patterns is governed by \nan internal motivation (e.g. Friend, 1989) and that expression of the behaviour itself may have \nrewarding properties, as it is unlikely that the individual is capable of assessing long term efficacy \nor reproductive fitness. From a proximate point of view, the involvement of some reward can \ntherefore underpin the regular performance of the display (see e.g. Hernnstein, 1977; Spruijt et \nal., 1992, 2001). This concept of self-rewarding behaviours can be used to explain why ceratin \nbehaviours such as exploration, foraging, grooming, still appear in the behavioural repertoires of \ncaptive animals, even when the functional benefits of their performance have been removed. \nSpruijt et al. (2001) more recently investigated neurobiological evidence for these rewards, based \non studies of addiction and affect (e.g. Berridge, 1996; Berridge and Robinson, 1998; Panksepp, \n1998; Panksepp and Burgdorf, 2003) by studying the link between neuronal structures and the \nphases (appetitive and consummatory) of patterns of behaviour. Spruijt and colleagues (2001) \ndescribed behavioural patterns in terms of appetitive and consummatory activities, where the \nappetitive components have been associated with mesolimbic dopamine (e.g. Schultz, 1998, \n2000; Berridge, 1996; Panksepp, 1998). Panksepp (1998) had previously characterised the \nappetitive components as seeking behaviour; whereas Berridge (1996) characterised this \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 6\n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \nmotivational phase as wanting, whilst  consummatory activities were more associated with linking \nincentives with rewards. \nAlternatively the term behavioural priority can be used instead of behavioural needs as \nintroduced by Mason et al (2001) and discussed by Cooper and Albertosa (2003). The term \n\u201cbehavioural priority\u201d takes into account a hierarchy of requirements, in line with different \nmotivations, whereby the need to satisfy these particular motivations depends on internal and \nexternal circumstances, as well as previous experiences and current circumstances and takes \ninto account the motivational and emotional state of the particular individual (see Cooper and \nAlbertosa, 2003). Hence, context is an important factor on describing behavioural needs and it \nmay even critically address practical issues of derived from precise definitions on behavioural \nneeds (Jensen and Toates, 1993). For the purposes of this paper we shall use Jensen and \nToates concept of behavioural needs as the conceptual framework to discuss the findings of \nempirical studies, as this has value to predicting the features we would expect of a behavioural \nneed, and use the concept of behavioural priorities when assessing the relative importance of \nalternative resources as this has more practical value in on farm welfare assessment than \nabsolute,definitions of need. \n  \n \n Several characteristics of behavioural needs are mentioned in the literature. In short, some \nmain characteristics of behavioural needs are: (1) Absence of stimuli that are indispensable for \nessential activities, or denying the actual performance of essential behavioural patterns, can \ninduce a state of chronic stress, resulting into physiological and\/or behavioural pathology (e.g. \nHughes, 1980; Friend, 1989; van Liere and Wiepkema, 1992; Broom and Johnson, 1993; Jensen \nand Toates, 1993; Vestergaard et al., 1997); (2) The behaviour can be performed without the \npresence of eliciting cues (primarily internally motivated; e.g. Friend, 1989); (3) The behaviour is \nperformed at a higher rate when the animal is first allowed to perform the behaviour after a period \nof deprivation (\u201cdamming-up\u201d: Friend, 1989 or rebound effects Vestergaard 1982); (4) The \npresence of vacuum activities (Hughes and Duncan, 1988), i.e. animals deprived of an \nopportunity to perform an action might eventually show it even in the absence of the required \nstimuli: laying hens \u201cdust bath\u201d even when the dust bathing substrate is absent (see e.g. Widowski \nand Duncan, 2000); (5) The display itself has rewarding properties, involving meso-limbic \ndopamine and opioids (see e.g. Panksepp, 1998; Berridge, 1996; Spruijt et al., 2001). For a \nnumber of behaviours one could say that the display results in release of endorphins (opiate \nneuropeptide) which reinforce their occurrence: for example, social behaviour (van Ree et al, \n1999), play (VanderSchuren, 1995a, b), and grooming (Spruijt et al., 1992) are facilitated by \nopioids and their occurance can decrease following treatment with an opiate antagonist. \n Two issues remain clear in the discussion of essential needs. Firstly, it is not possible to \ngive precise standards on timing, duration and frequency that a particular \u2018indispensable\u2019 \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 7\n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \nbehavioural pattern should be performed by an individual member of the species, as this depends \non the context (see Jensen and Toates, 1993; Cooper and Albertosa, 2003). As behavioural \nneeds involve species specific patterns, the only sure statement to be made is that it seems \nevident that these particular patterns are performed by all individuals of that species, e.g. \ningestion of nutrients, thus searching for food is essential to all animals (essential for survival: see \nPoole, 1992), and can also be seen in captivity if the opportunity is there (jc note, not sure I agree \nwith this statement). Secondly, it is debateable how many of the aforementioned characteristics \nshould be demonstrated before one should entitle a pattern as \u2018indispensable\u2019. Alternatively, does \nthe occurrence of just one of these characteristics indicate we should treat an activity as a \nbehavioural need? Although an interesting topic for future scientific discussions, this paper does \nnot aim to use this listing in this particular way. The list only involves some important issues that \nmay be helpful to elucidate the discussion on minks\u2019 motivation to a swimming bath in more detail. \n These above-mentioned features can be found in many other discussions on behavioural \nneeds and\/or behavioural priorities in other species. Notable examples include  the dust bathing \nbehaviour of chickens (e.g. Vestergaard, 1980, 1982; ; Nicol and Guilford, 1991; Vestergaard et \nal., 1997, 1999; van Liere and Wiepkema, 1992; Petherick et al., 1995; Johnsen and Vestergaard, \n1996; Lindberg and Nicol, 1997; Duncan et al., 1998; Widowski and Duncan, 2000; Nicol et al., \n2001), nesting and pre-laying behaviour in the laying hen (e.g. Cooper and Appleby, 1995, 1996, \n1997) and the rooting of pigs (e.g. Lawrence and Terlouw, 1993; Horrell et al., 2001; Studnitz and \nJensen, 2002; Tuyttens, 2005). \n \nCompensatory actions  \n \nWhere the necessary elicting stimuli for the display of an important behaviour are absent in the \nanimals\u2019 environment, abnormal behaviours have been described (Fox, 1968). These include \nstereotypic behaviour in the absence of rooting substrate for pigs (e.g. Lawrence and Terlouw, \n1993); hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviour in canids and polar bears when opportunities are \nabsent to explore (e.g. Wechsler, 1991; Clubb and Mason, 2003). One hypothesis that links \nbehavioural deprivation and stereotypic behaviours is the involvement of reward systems that may \ncompensate for inability to interact with functional substrates or meet relevant behavioural \nendpoints (e.g. Cronin et al., 1985, 1986; Cabib, 1993; Cabib and Puglisi-Allegra, 1996, Spruijt et \nal., 2001). The compensation hypothesis and its underlying mechanism are demonstrated on \nstudies on play (e.g. van der Schuren et al., 1995a, b; 1997): play deprived animals compensate \nby enhanced sucrose intake and increased bodyweight. Morphine counteracted this \ncompensatory sucrose intake, which can be explained that the absence of play-induced release of \nendorphins is compensated by morphine.  \n In this compensation hypothesis, the display of compensatory behaviours may be elicited if \nreward systems are sensitised by stress (for sensitisation of reward systems in case of stress: see \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 8\n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \nPiazza et al., 1990). Self rewarding behaviours, which still can be performed, are likely candidates \nto compensate for the \"lack of reward\" and may even be performed in a compulsive way. It is \nespecially these kinds of behaviours, (e.g. perseverance of intentional activities such as foraging \npatterns and self directed activities such as grooming), that appear to be prone to develop into \nstereotypic behaviours (e.g. Spruijt et al., 1992; Rushen et al., 1993; Spruijt et al., 2001), in case \nof frustration (e.g. Duncan and Wood-Gush, 1972; Mason, 1991), lack of stimulation (e.g. Mason, \n1991; Broom and Johnson, 1993) and other chronic stressful conditions (e.g. Cronin and \nWiepkema, 1984; Cronin et al., 1985; Mason, 1991; Broom and Johnson, 1993; Rushen et al., \n1993). Theoretically, this might be the background of some behavioural pathology. \n \nIndividual variation and prior experience \n \n The consequences of individual experience on the performance of particularly motivated \nbehavioural patterns, and the need to perform these particular patterns on long term, is an area in \ndiscussions on behavioural needs. Behaviours that have to be performed even if the animal has \nnever had experience of  eliciting stimuli in the appropriate context (and have been described as \nmotivated mainly by internal mechanisms patterns, Hughes, 1980; Hughes and Duncan, 1981), \nshould appear different from an induced pattern of activity resulting from prior experience. The \nlatter might be referred to as an \u201cincentive induced need\u201d or \u201cincentive induced motivation\u201d (as \nderived from drug addiction literature: e.g. van Ree et al., 1999), and may not be classified as a \nbehavioural need (who has said this, is it an opinion we are making, in which case again, not sure \nI 100% agree, the arguments below make sence, BUT, in much the same way that it is \nchallenging to absolutely demonstrate no role of experience in claiming an activity is \u201cinnate\u201d, I \nthink its challenging to absolutely demonstrate an activity is induced or non-induced). Compared \nto activities that are not incentive-induced, this leaves us the same theoretical question: how \nmuch can a particular individual subject suffer if denied from its \u201cincentive induced need\u201d? In \npractice, however, an incentive induced motivation may never have consequences for the animal \nif never provided. Thus, in view of animal welfare in practice the question still is: which behaviours \nform an indispensable part of the animal\u2019s repertoire and which are induced by prior experience \nand can be missed in captivity if the animal has no such prior experience?  \n Although an elaborated overview on behavioural needs is not within the scope of the \npresent paper, nevertheless, it is expected that classification is at least based on some of the \nabove-mentioned characteristics and principles__ they are used as the general framework for \nfurther discussion in this paper. \n \n \n3.  Minks\u2019 natural habitats: land and water \n \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 9\n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \nFor the largest part of the year, mink live solitarily in territories along watersides, such as rivers, \nlakes and coast sites (Gerell, 1970; Birks, 1981; Dunstone, 1993) with more than one den side \n(Birks and Linn, 1982). Mink show great flexibility in prey species. Seasonal fluctuations in \navailability of prey, i.e. abundance and ease of capture, necessitate mink to have a flexible \nhunting strategy on land and in the water (Dunstone, 1993). Dunstone (1993, p. 63) mentioned \ntwo likely reasons why wild mink may choose to enter the water in search of prey: 1) either \nterrestrial prey becomes more difficult to capture than aquatic prey, or 2) there is an increase in \nthe ease of exploitation of aquatic prey: e.g. decreased ambient temperature decreases the \nescape reactivity of the poikilothermic fish prey (Gerell, 1967).  \n Mink\u2019s adaptations to under-water hunting are not optimal as compared to the otter or \nmore strictly aquatic animals (e.g. seals), but are appropriate and efficient: their fore- and hind \nfeet are inter-digitally webbed, they have a semi-water resistant pelt (mean pelt density from mid-\nback region: 780 hairs\/cm\u00b2, Dunstone, 1979), and they have some adaptation of the anatomy of \nthe eyes to overcome the refractive problems involving underwater vision (Sinclair et al., 1974; \nDunstone, 1993, p. 51). Results on respiratory adaptations to diving, like bradycardia, are not \nconclusive in the literature, but Dunstone (1993, p. 43) concluded that minks\u2019 dives, with a \nrecorded maximum length up until 30 seconds, are aerobic, i.e. carried out using the body\u2019s \nnormal oxygen reserves. In addition to aquatic adaptations, mink can also run fast and see well \non land, and so, appears to be optimally equipped to apply for a maximum of profits in two kinds \nof hunting habitats (see Dunstone, 1978). \n Some feral populations of American mink are known in Europe (e.g. Dunstone and Ireland, \n1989; Ireland, 1990; Halliwell and MacDonald, 1996) and are described to be responsible for the \ndecline of many endemic species and sea bird colonies (e.g. Bonesi et al., 2006). Recently, a \ndecline was observed of the feral mink population in England, which was explained by an \ninterspecific competition of Mustela vison with the native otter population (Bonesi et al., 2006). \n \n \n4.  Swimming of mink in captivity \n \nIn a semi-natural cage, juvenile mink were observed to start entering the water pool at the age of \nabout seven weeks (Kuby, 1982). Poole and Dunstone (1976) mentioned that their experimental \nsubjects, hand raised ranch-bred mink, had to be given experience of water at an early age or \nthey never became proficient swimmers when adult. In their studies they always trained their new \nbatch of mink kits by encouraging them to swim. Interestingly, de Jonge and Leipoldt (1994) \nobserved that the water bath was more attractive around feeding times. In general, they described \nmink\u2019s behaviour towards the water bath as \u201chesitating\u201d: i.e. the subjects stopped in front of the \nwaterside and even sat along the water for long periods before entering the water; sometimes \nthey accidentally fell into the water, but than the subjects always left the water quickly (cf de \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 10\n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \nJonge and Leipoldt, 1994, p. 142). In contrast to \u201chesitating\u201d, Kuby (1982, p. 56-57) mentioned \nmink\u2019s swimming an \u201cinnate\u201d pattern, and described the first swimming performance of one of his \nmink pups \u201cnor looking clumsy neither unsure\u201d. \n The aquatic hunting of mink is thoroughly described by Poole and Dunstone (1976) based \non series of laboratory observations and experiments. Most striking was their observation that \nfishes were generally detected by their mink subjects before they entered the water by the head \ndip, whereby mink typically peers its head under water while having a continue grip on land with \ntheir hind feet; only when prey is localised they dive into the water (Dunstone, 1978; see \nKorhonen et al., 2003 for recent observations of head dipping on farms). In the water tank, mink \nshowed surface swimming as well as underwater swimming, whereas surface swimming was \nfound to be the slowest mode of progression (38 cm\/s, Dunstone, 1979). Mohaibes et al. (2002, \n2003) studied the behaviour of farmed mink also in the winter period when the water of the water \nbath was partially or totally frozen: the partially frozen ice offered the subjects novel challenges \nand the mink started to creep into the cave-like holes in the ice, to dig the sludge and to \nmanipulate parts of ice (Mohaibes et al., 2003).  \n \n Addressing the frequency of mink\u2019s water-use under farmed conditions, Skovgaard et al. \n(1997a, b), Hansen and Jeppesen (2001b), Mohaibes et al. (2001, 2002, 2003) showed clear \nindividual differences in the use of the water bath. Some animals never entered the water: e.g. in \nthe study of Skovgaard et al. (1997b) fourteen subjects of a total of forty animals provided with \nwater never entered the bath; in the study of Hansen and Jeppesen (2001b) one of a total of \neleven subjects, of which the behaviour was recorded for 24 hours, did not swim. \n Vinke et al. (2005) studied twenty-eight wild-coloured juvenile mink reared in the presence \nof a water bath and observed that the juveniles spent a mean percentage of total observations of \n1.4 in or around the water bath, whereby the exploration of the bath and the head dip were \nobserved most frequently. This percentage was identical to the percentage for adult mink as \nobserved by Skovgaard et al. (1997b: 1.4% of the total scans, in 40 subjects provided with a \nwater bath). In a pilot, de Jonge and Leipoldt (1994) observed seven adult females in cages with a \nwater bath from 7 hours until 1 hour before feeding time: they found that the females spent their \ntime inside the water in a range of 0-11% (of the total observations), and around the water bath in \na range of 2-27%, whereby specifically one female scored in the higher ranges. Additionally, they \nfound that the subjects increased their time in and around the water bath before feeding time.  \n Mohaibes et al. (2003) observed forty-five scan-glow female mink and found mean \npercentages of total observations of swimming of 0.35% (\u00b1 0.59 S.D; N=14) in July and 0.60% \u00b1 \n(0.57 S.D; N=14) in September-October. The percentage of observations in the swimming pool \nwhen the pools were partially frozen was 9.5% (\u00b1 5.0 S.D.; N=14). Hansen and Jeppesen (2001b) \nreported that the number of swims of eleven mink during 24 hours ranged from 0-177; and that \nthe durations of swimming bouts varied from 2 to 55 seconds.  \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 11\n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n Hansen and Jeppesen (2000a, b) described an experimental design with three connected \ncages, having a water bath or an empty cage in the middle: the experimental subjects always had \nto pass the water bath or the empty cage to reach the food location and\/or the nest box, or they \ncould choose an alternative \u201cdry-route\u201d as created by a tunnel above the water bath. If the access \nto the opposite cages was only possible through the water bath, the animals appeared to be \nslower in reaching food and crossed less frequently between the food and the nest box, as \ncompared to situations that they either could use the tunnel or had a dry middle cage. In addition, \nanimals scratched more at the blocked tunnel access if the only available route was through the \nwater, than when they could go through a dry middle cage. The latter may indicate that the mink \npreferred to use the alternative dry tunnel route to the food. The results suggest that under some \ncircumstances or for some individuals, water can act as a barrier. Although these kinds of designs \ncan yield further insight into the incentive value of water baths, the papers did not report the \nfrequency of water- and tunnel passages in more detail and gave no insight whether the dry route \nmight also be the faster route. \n The frequencies of \u2018swimming\u2019 and \u2018around the water bath\u2019, may give some insight into the \ncontribution of this particular patterns in farmed minks\u2019 time budget, nevertheless, they are not \nnecessarily indicative for the value of swimming water for farmed mink: not all essential \nbehavioural patterns should be expressed continuously in high frequencies to become classified \nas indispensable. This highly depends on other factors as well, e.g. sexes, age, observation \nseason. On the other hand, the topic of the observed individual variation, with some individuals \nnever entering the bath, is worthwhile to be addressed in the discussion, as a behavioural need \npur sang is expected to be performed by all individuals because it concerns a species specific \nmotivation and \/ or pattern. \n \n \n5.  The presence or absence of swimming water and effects on stereotypical behaviour  \n and some other welfare indicators \n \nStereotypies in the presence and absence of a water bath \nOne of the best described behavioural pathologies in mink is the occurrence and development of \nstereotypies (see point [1] of the afore-mentioned characteristics of behavioural needs). In some \nstudies the occurrence of minks\u2019 stereotypies was observed in the presence and absence of a \nwater bath. \n De Jonge and Leipoldt (1994) concluded that the availability of swimming water did not \nsignificantly reduce stereotypical behaviours in adult mink (N=7 females). Skovgaard et al. \n(1997a, b) studied adult mink in the absence and presence of swimming water. They concluded \nthat the free access to swimming water had no significant effects on reproduction level \n(Skovgaard et al, 1997a; N= 64; females and males) or on stereotypies (Skovgaard et al., 1997b; \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 12\n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \nN= 64; females and males). Hansen and Jeppesen (2001a) concluded that swimming water may \nnot be classified as a behavioural need for mink, because the introduction of water was not \nfollowed by a reduction in stereotypical behaviour. Hansen (1998) reported an increased activity \nwhen the water was refreshed in the experimental water trays, \u201clike that which is seen just before \nfeeding time\u201d (Hansen, 1990, 1998), but he found no effects on reproduction level or immune \nresponses. Some studies reported that mink subjects were performing stereotypical patterns \ninside or in the presence of a water bath (Skovgaard et al., 1997a; Mohaibes et al., 2002, 2003; \nVinke, 2004). Vinke et al. (2006) found no differences in anticipatory or in stereotypical behaviour \nin 4 months respectively 10 months old mink, in the presence and absence of swimming water \n(N= 56 females in total; Water present vs absent: 24 subjects per group). Mohaibes et al. (2002, \n2003) investigated the effects of a swimming bath on stereotypical behaviour: they found that \nmink with baths had less frequent stereotypic behaviour than mink without baths. This difference \nwas statistically significant in Mohaibes et al. (2002), although only a tendency was found in \nMohaibes et al. (2003).  \n In conclusion, it appears that in most studies the presence of swimming water does not \nsignificantly influence the levels of stereotypies and some other used parameters (e.g. \nreproduction, immune response, anticipatory behaviour). A critical note must be mentioned \ntowards the age of the experimental subjects in all studies and the consideration that stereotypical \nbehaviour can established over age (e.g. Mason, 1991; Mason, 1993a, b): most aforementioned \nstudies are carried out with adult mink. Comprehensibly, a study with subjects that have already \nestablished a stereotypy is different from a study that starts with juveniles that are free of \nstereotypies. Without a baseline study for the level of stereotypical behaviour at the beginning of \nthe experiment, the interpretation on the effects of swimming water on the development of \nstereotypical behaviour is hard. \n \nThe presence of swimming water may induce play behaviour \nVinke et al. (2005) demonstrated increased display of play of juvenile mink on the cage floor in the \npresence of swimming water. No significant relation could be found between juvenile play and \nstereotypical behaviour in adulthood. Nevertheless, the observation of play can be of interest for \nwelfare assessment, as play is not performed under stressful conditions (Lawrence, 1987; Broom \nand Johnson, 1993). In rats, it has been shown that juvenile play is necessary for coping with \nsocial stress in adulthood (van den Berg, 1999; van den Berg et al., 1999a, b; von Frijtag, 2001; \nvon Frijtag et al., 2002). Play is a typical example of a behavioural pattern with long-term adaptive \nvalue, but without high priority at a short term. Additionally, play involves opioids (VanderSchuren \net al., 1995a, b). Play, therefore, has been proposed as a positive indicator of animal welfare. \nThus, indirectly, stimuli such as water, eliciting play may enhance the animal\u2019s coping capacity \nand contribute to the animals\u2019 well being by their rewarding properties of the mere display.  \n \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 13\n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n \n6.  What is swimming water worth to mink, and can it be substituted? \n \nAs discussed before, a water bath may mean either a reward or a barrier for some individual \nmink. The question still emerges: is swimming water merely enriching, or is its presence \nindispensable for farmed mink? Methods to assess the animal\u2019s appraisal of its situation are: (i) \nassessing the price the animal is willing to pay for access as addressed by consumer-demand \nstudies (e.g. Dawkins, 1983; 1990; Mason et al., 1997, 1999; Cooper and Mason, 1997, 2000) \nand (ii) assessing the sensitivity of the reward systems as addressed by studies measuring the \nintensity of anticipatory behaviour (e.g. von Frijtag et al., 2000, 2001; Spruijt et al., 2001; van der \nHarst, 2003; van der Harst et al., 2003, Vinke et al., 2004b, 2006, Dudink et al., 2006). \nTheoretically, anticipatory behaviour preceding an incentive can be induced without previous \nexperience of swimming water. Thus, this method can be applied to assess and compare the \nsensitivity of the reward system of mink in the presence, absence and after deprivation of a \nswimming bath, and so, may give some insight into the effects of experience on swimming \nmotivation (\"can you miss what you do not know?\"). Consumer demand tests are used to assess \nhow the animal values different resources and are especially based on two techniques borrowed \nfrom human economics: 1) the measurement of elasticity of demand and 2) the measurement of \nincome elasticity (Mason et al., 1997). It is assumed that the resources that are valued highly by \nthe animal are inelastic: the animal will invest much energy, e.g. press more weight, to get access \nto this resource. In human society, the market of bread or rice as basic foods, are called inelastic \nas people will remain to buy it, whatever the price. On the contrary, all kinds of luxury products \nlike cars and audios can be seen as elastic. \n \n In a consumer-demand set-up of Mason and colleagues (2001), eight male and eight \nfemale mink could choose to \u201cpay costs\u201d (i.e. push doors with variable weights: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. \n1 or 1.12 kg for seven successive days) for either a water bath, an alternative nest site, novel \nobjects, a raised platform, toys, a tunnel or an empty cage. They found that farmed mink, with the \nexception to food, rated the water bath as the most valuable resource, as it attracted the greatest \ntotal expenditure and the highest reservation price, greatest consumer surplus measures of utility, \nand the most inelastic demand  (Mason et al., 2001, p. 35). \n In a subsequent study, the direct influence of stimuli eliciting the motivation to swim was \nexcluded (\u201cIs out of sight out of mind?\u201d): Warburton and Mason (2003) studied the hierarchy of \nfour test resources, (i.e. food, water bath, social contact and toy) in two ways: 1) \"cues treatment\": \nresource cues were present when preference was expressed and 2) \"no cues treatment\": \nresource cues were distant and (visually) screened at the choice point (N= 6 in both treatments). \nThey reported that food was preferred in both treatments, but motivation for toys and possibly also \nunpredictable social contact declined in the \"no cue treatment\". They tentatively suggested that \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 14\n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \nthe visibility of water might have little effect on the motivation for the water bath. Thus, water cues \ndo not elicit the need for it, although this does not address the issue of experience. Previous \nfindings on the preference on resources of farmed mink in the study of Mason et al. (2001) were \nmost closely replicated by the findings from the \u201cNo Cues treatment\u201d in the study of Warburton \nand Mason (2003), which might appear paradoxical in the sense of that in the first study the cues \nwere available at the point of preference measurement. Differences between the two separate \nstudies might be explained by the small sample size, differences in the used mink populations, \nused test resources and effects of habituation. \n Hansen and Jensen (2006a, b) also used a consumer-demand design to assess the \nrewarding properties of a water bath and a running wheel either separately, in a situation whereby \nboth resources were present at the same time, and in a situation whereby one of the experimental \nresources was \u201cfree\u201d (no pay) and the alternative was not. The subjects in this design could pay \ncosts by pressing a lever on fixed ratio schedules varying from 5 up to a level of 60 times pressing \nfor access to the experimental resource. There were no differences between the elasticity of the \ndemand for swimming water and a running wheel, indicating that mink valued these two types of \ncage enrichment similarly. However, mink needed more rewards to lower the motivation for \nlocomotive activity in the running wheel (higher intensity of the curve) than to lower the motivation \nfor exploration in the water. Each supposed occupational enrichment has to be evaluated in \nrelation to the motivation behind the use of the actual resource, but in the present experiment the \nrunning wheel had a higher occupational value for the mink than the water bath. \n The simultaneous presence of both resources did not affect the demand for either running \nwheel or swimming water in the study of Hansen and Jensen (2006a, b). Furthermore, with free \naccess to either of them mink did not increase their use of the running wheel as the price of \nswimming water increased, or their use of swimming water as the price of running wheel \nincreased. Therefore, the two resources did not appear to be a substitute for each other. Both a \nrunning wheel and swimming water were valued higher than access to an empty water box. Mink \nmainly used the running wheel during their normal activity periods, whereas, the swimming water \nwas primarily used in the morning when the water box was refilled and the mink were fed. Based \non the lack of substitutability between the two resources and the different diurnal patterns, it was \nsuggested that different motivations underlie the two test resources. \n \n \n7.   The effects of prior experience of a water bath and deprivation on some \n behavioural and physiological parameters \n \nPrior experience of a water bath might influence an animal's motivation to use a bath. In the \nliterature, we found some studies addressing the effects of deprivation of a previously \nexperienced water bath and deprivation. \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 15\n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n In the studies of Mohaibes et al. (2002, 2003) mink with a swimming bath experience for \nseveral weeks were deprived of their baths for two weeks by blocking the access to the bath. In \nboth studies the average values for the amount of stereotypies were higher during than before or \nafter the deprivation, but it was not reported whether these differences were statistically \nsignificant. Furthermore, addressing the amount of stereotypies during the deprivation in the bath \ngroup, the mink did not differ significantly from two control groups deprived of access to an extra \ncage (of the size of the bath) or deprived of nothing (Mohaibes et al., 2003). During the \ndeprivation period all three groups had available standard mink cages with standard nest boxes. \n In another study, conditions with a water bath and without a water bath (standard housing) \ndid not change the level mink\u2019s anticipatory behaviour preceding a food reward. Neither was the \nlevel of anticipatory behaviour significantly affected after a two-week deprivation of swimming \nwater whereby the water was removed from the bath (Vinke, 2004; Vinke et al., 2006: water-group \nand control-group: 2x14 subjects, each split into: Cue-US treatment n= 7 vs Cue-no CS treatment, \nn=7 as a control for anticipation). In rats, it has been shown that enrichment reduces anticipatory \nbehaviour preceding a food reward and that isolation stress increased this behaviour (van der \nHarst, 2003). Therefore, the result obtained in mink might suggest that mink valued swimming \nwater and the empty bath in a similar way, though larger samples would be needed in the study of \nVinke et al. (2006) to rule out type II errors. \n Addressing physiological parameters, Mason et al. (2001) found higher increased levels of \nthe stress hormone cortisol in urine samples, 24 hours after blocking the access to a swimming \nbath. Compared to baseline values and to other situations with blocked incentives, the increased \ncortisol levels indicate that the value of swimming water might be higher than the value of other \nenriching objects in the test with the exception of food, which like-wise increased the level of \nurinary cortisol. In a more recent study, Warburton and Mason (2006, p. 77) found that preventing \nbath-access significant induced access attempts (\u201cscrabbling\u201d), although they found no significant \ncorticosteroid response. In addition, Korhonen et al. (2003) found increased levels of urinary \ncortisol-creatinine and corticosterone-creatinine ratios after blocking access to swimming water: \nthe adrenocortical response was highest during the second week of deprivation and decreased \nthereafter. These results indicate on a short-term stress (24 hours-two weeks) after a period of \ndeprivation by blocking. \n An alternative explanation of increased levels of cortisol might be found in the fact that \nmink prefer to drink from the water bath (Hansen and Jeppesen, 2003) instead of their water \nbottle or drink nipple. Consequently, mink that are denied access to the water bath may drink less \nfor a period which may also enhance the cortisol levels (Tauson, 1999). A recent study of \nWarburton and Mason (2006, p. 77) found that the cortisol levels were not changed significantly \nwhen preventing the access to the bath. No information was available on the level of water \nconsumption. \n \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 16\n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n Referring to some other previously mentioned characteristics of behavioural needs, the \nstudy of Korhonen et al. (2003) reported that the deprivation of swimming water did not alter the \noccurrence of stereotypical behaviour and that no vacuum activities (point 5) have been reported \nin mink in relation to swimming water. The expression of vacuum activities in relation to swimming \nwater, in whatever form either related or not to e.g. specific stereotypical patterns, remain unclear \nin the literature. The same can be concluded for rebound effects: rebound effects (point 4) after a \nperiod of deprivation have hardly been described in the studies. Korhonen et al. (2003) reported \nno rebound responses in behaviours such as swimming, head dipping or staying on the jetty after \nthe deprivation of swimming water was discontinued. A study of Cooper and Mason (2000, p. 147) \nreported a drop in the number of compartment visits combined with more intensive interactions \nwith the swimming pool, i.e. more bouts of swimming were performed per visit, when entry prices \nincreased. More intense interactions with the resource once the cost has been overcome might \npoint to a kind of rebound effect, but this is in this case difficult to interpret.  \n \nBlockade and removal of a swimming bath: deprivation dilemma? \n Korhonen et al. (2003) reported a tendency to an increased amount of biting\/scratching the \ncage as a result of deprivation (i.e. blocking the entry), which suggests a general increase of \nrestlessness. Furthermore, removing the water bath out of sight or removing the water and \nleaving an empty bath, resulted into increased levels of stereotypical behaviour, tail biting and \ncortisol levels in the blocking-treated subjects (Mason et al., 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003; Vinke, \n2004). It should be considered that the blockade of an entry door that an animal had priory access \nto, might be stressful anyhow whatever is behind that door, e.g. swimming water, nest boxes, \nspace (Hansen and Jeppesen, 2000a, b; see for a discussion Vinke, 2004). The removal of the \nwhole bath from the cage preferably out of sight of the animal, therefore, might be a better \nexperimental design for deprivation studies. Finally, it should be noted that deprivation studies \nalways imply that animals have been in contact with swimming water, and thus, that the results \nmight indicate on pure incentive-induced motivations. \n In conclusion, deprivation of swimming water by blocking significantly influences some \nphysiological parameters on adrenocortical responses, indicating on a higher level of stress at \nleast on the short term. The way animals are deprived of a test incentive, blocking vs removal, is a \npoint of discussion and should be elucidated in future studies. So far, prior experiences of \nswimming water seem to have little effect on stereotypical behaviour and anticipatory behaviour. \nThe effects of experience should be elucidated in more detail. \n \n \n8. Why mink might be motivated to have swimming water? \n \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 17\n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \n612 \n613 \n614 \nAs the meaning of swimming water for farmed mink can be variable, different underlying \nmotivations of the use of a water bath should be taken into account: does mink use a water bath \nfor thermoregulation, as an easy drinking site, additional space (in most studies represented by \nempty baths), or as an exploration and foraging opportunity? Hansen and Jeppesen (2003) \nconcluded that swimming water is not used as a thermoregulatory mechanism by mink, as their \nexperimental subjects did not show increased levels of swimming at high temperatures. Based on \nthe level of the water emerged from the basin, Vinke et al. (2004a) found that the mink used the \nwater bath considerably less during high ambient temperatures which was the consequence of a \ngeneral decrease of all activities. This is in line with the prior study of Hansen and Jeppesen \n(2003). The topic of easy drinking was studied by Mason et al. (1999): in a consumer-demand \nexperiment: mink chose for a water bath in order to drink and swim. To exclude the swimming and \ndrinking motivation, a water bowl was provided for free for \u201ceasy drinkable water\u201d: the subjects still \nworked for swimming. These findings were affirmed by a more recent study of Warburton and \nMason (2006, p. 77). Mason et al. (2001) also controlled for the value of additional space and \nexploration objects but found lower preferences for these choices than for the access to a water \nbath. \n Although not totally elucidated, the meaning of a water bath for mink seems most likely \nrelated to foraging behaviour: on land (running, exploring sides) or in the water (exploring, head \ndipping, swimming) (Hansen and Jensen, 2006a, b). The observation that the swimming bath \nseemed especially attractive around feeding times (e.g. de Jonge and Leipoldt, 1994) suggests \nthat a water site may stimulate exploration to or into the water as a part of appetitive feeding \nbehaviour. Though in other species, the impossibility to display adequate foraging behaviour is \nmentioned as a main cause of the development of stereotypical behaviour in captive animals (e.g. \npigs: Terlouw et al., 1991; Mason and Mendl, 1997), this seems not unequivocally the case in \nmink. Hypothetically, in line with mink\u2019s naturally opportunistic lifestyle in a combined habitat of \nland and water (frozen or unfrozen), it can be expected that farmed mink might be able to cope \nwith different situations in an environment providing enough alternative stimuli allowing the \nperformance of one of its strategies. \n \n \n9. General comments on the available studies and data and evaluation of methods \n \nBefore elucidating final conclusions, some general comments on the available studies and data \naddressing the topic on the importance of swimming water for farmed mink are addressed in more \ndetail. Table 1 systematically overviews and summarizes some quality parameters as available in \nthe presented papers (e.g. the water bath measures, water hygiene, sample sizes in the \nexperiment, percentage of subjects using the bath, colour type used, age and sex of the subjects, \nobservation time and period). \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 18\n615 \n616 \n617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \n634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \n652 \n \n[about here table 1] \n \nComments on some quality parameters in the available studies \nFocussing on farmed minks\u2019 appraisal of swimming baths in particular, it should be noted that a \nlimited number of studies is available. In table 1, it can be seen that most studies used the colour \ntype wild and adult female mink, but not all studies. Also within studies the experimental \npopulations could include some subgroups (see the comments in the column sample size, table \n1). In some studies it was not always clear how the different subgroups (e.g. male vs female; age) \ncontributed to the presented results. Age of the subjects did vary between the studies, which \nmakes a comparison between the papers rather difficult. However, some studies especially aimed \nto collect information on long term, and therefore followed the same subjects from juvenile until \nadulthood, which gives important additional information on the development of behavioural and \nphysiological pathology in the presence and absence of a swimming bath. \nInformation on the used breeds or the origin of breeds in the papers, mostly involved no \nfurther details except for the farm the minks were bred. Differences in breeds quite probably \naccount for less standardisation in farmed mink research, but standard breeds such as known in \nlaboratory research in rats and mice are not available for farmed mink. This situation, however, \ndoes not differ from other applied studies on other farm animal species. \nA lot of the presented papers involved studies that include 24h video registrations. During \ndaily observations, the animals were observed on randomised reversal schemes. Especially the \n24h observations are very valuable to have a clear insight into the bath-use of farmed mink. In \nmost studies, the behavioural observations were conducted using a scan sampling and\/or a focal \nanimal sampling method, which mostly seems the most reliable method to answer the research \nquestion(s) as mentioned in the paper and the given research possibilities. Consumer-demand \nand anticipation tests used other specific parameters which are based on the literature of previous \nresearch in mink or also other species.  \nAddressing the season of observations, the available papers cover all months in the year. \nStudies concerning the juvenile behaviour were around June-August which is conform the normal \ndevelopment of mink. Some researches specifically aimed a long term study and covered a whole \nyear or more. Most studies, therefore, are rather complementally than comparable. \nBath designs and measures may vary in all the available studies. Although \u2018\u2019the adequate\u2019\u2019 \nmeasure is always discussable, most studies used a bath with a length of more than one meter \nand a water depth of at least 15 cm. In all studies the water bath was free accessible except for \nthe special experiments, of course, like the consumer demands and the studies wherein the \nsubjects were deprived of their water bath. In all studies the water was cleaned regularly. \nDifferences in hygiene and so the attractiveness of the water bath in the different studies, \ntherefore, appears not a point of discussion though none of the studies appointed the quality of \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 19\n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \n657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n666 \n667 \n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n677 \n678 \n679 \n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \n686 \n687 \n688 \n689 \n690 \ntheir swimming water in their study precisely. Surprisingly, as all studies aimed to give insight on \nfarmed mink water bath-use, most papers do not give a precise insight into the exact number of \nanimals that actually used the water bath during the study (column: # subj. using bath [%], table \n1). \n Another topic that should be noted is that the sample sizes in some studies might be too \nsmall to find significances on particular behavioural patterns or parameters, thus, type II errors \nmight be an alternative explanation for non significant results. Type II errors as an alternative \nexplanation for the finding of non significant results, might play a role in the studies of Warburton \nand Mason (2003) and Vinke et al. (2006). [about here table 2] \n \nSome specific points of discussion on the results in the available studies \n Addressing all available studies, no clear differences in the occurrence of tail biting, \nstereotypical and anticipatory behaviour between subjects housed in the presence (water-\nexperienced subjects) or absence (water-naive subjects) of a water bath could be demonstrated. \nStereotypical behaviour could still be observed in the presence of a water bath (e.g. Skovgaard et \nal., 1997b; Vinke, 2004), which suggests that the provision of a water bath is not enough to meet \nall minks\u2019 needs in an otherwise barren environment. \n In deprivation experiments, blocking the access to a previously experienced water bath \nmight be stressful for farmed mink as shown by increased levels of stereotypical behaviour, tail \nbiting (Korhonen et al., 2003; Vinke, 2004) and indications are found that deprivation of a prior \nexperienced water bath significantly increased the levels of cortisol, which might indicate  \nincreased stress at least on a short-term (i.e. < 2 weeks) in the blocking-treatment (Mason et al., \n2001; Korhonen et al., 2003). The question remains whether a blockade of a previously open \nentry-door might be frustrating under all kinds of circumstances, whatever is behind the door? \nFuture studies might elucidate this issue in more detail. \n In case of studies that observe the presence of stereotypical behaviour under farmed \nconditions, which is a quite commonly used parameter in welfare studies, it can be questioned \nwhether this behavioural parameter is useful to study the effects of the presence of a water bath \n(see for a elaborated discussion on the reliability of stereotypies as welfare indicators: Mason and \nLatham, 2004)? This might be of special importance in mink considering the fact that effects might \nbe \u2018overshadowed\u2019 by the effects of other management factors in mink farming. Such a prominent \ninfluencing factor might be the food management and food delivery in farmed mink, e.g. food \ndeprivation in the winter (see e.g. Bilds\u00f8e et al., 1991; Mason, 1991; Nimon and Broom, 1999). \nNone of the available papers did address the used food regimes in detail, and it still can be \nquested how food regimes may influence the results on stereotypies during winter. Another topic \naddressing the stereotypy parameter, and which is often unclear in the papers, is the level of \nstereotypies in the experimental populations at the start of the study. Preferably one should start \nwith a non stereotyping population. \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 20\n691 \n692 \n693 \n694 \n695 \n696 \n697 \n698 \n699 \n700 \n701 \n702 \n703 \n704 \n705 \n706 \n707 \n708 \n709 \n710 \n711 \n712 \n713 \n714 \n715 \n716 \n717 \n718 \n719 \n720 \n721 \n722 \n723 \n724 \n725 \n726 \n727 \n728 \n Addressing the topics on preference, resource value and play behaviour, swimming water \npossibly has enriching and rewarding properties for mink as it facilitates exploration shortly (more \nenvironmental variability and choices), it may induce play behaviour in juveniles and mink is \nwilling to pay high prices (invest energy) to have access to swimming water in consumer-demand \nexperiments. Referring to the results of the studies of e.g. Hansen and Jeppesen (2000b, 2001a, \nb) it should be noted that a water bath might be a barrier for some individuals; at least we have to \nconsider that individual differences in the appraisal of a water bath may exist. Consumer-demand \ntests showed that mink is willing to invest energy for access to food and a swimming bath (Mason \net al., 2001), and for access to a running wheel (Hansen and Jensen, 2006a, b), or to a lesser \nextent, for access to other diverse enrichments (e.g. Mason et al., 2001). In the study of Hansen \nand Jensen (2006a, b), the experimental mink used the running wheel more than the swimming \nbath, whereas, the study of Mason et al. (2001) showed that mink preferred the swimming bath \nmore compared to other requirements, i.e. alternative nest site, novel objects, raised platform, \ntoys, tunnel and empty cage. The non substitutability of the running wheel and the swimming bath \nindicates on different underlying motivations to both resources, which might suggest that the \nimportance of each condition for farmed mink should be considered separately. \n \n Rewarding properties of behavioural patterns such as eating, drinking, social contact in \nsocial species and unnatural addictive behaviours are characterized by liking and wanting aspects \n(Berridge, 1996; Berridge and Robinson, 1998). Wanting increases in case of deprivation, and \nprobably underlies vacuum activities, anticipatory behaviour and rebound effects. In the literature, \nwanting is described to be related to an enhanced sensitivity to reward (Berridge, 1996; Berridge \nand Robinson, 1998). This enhanced sensitivity of the reward system in the absence of a water \nbath was not demonstrated in the study of Vinke et al. (2006). However, other studies showed \nthat a subsequent blockade appeared frustrating for mink that had previous contact with \nswimming water (Mason et al., 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003; Mohaibes et al., 2002, 2003; Vinke, \n2004). Apparently, experience does induce wanting which suggest that access to water is an \nincentive-induced motivation. Access to water for farmed mink might be comparable to running in \na running wheel for rodents (running wheel behaviour has been associated with incentive-induced \nbehaviour: e.g. Belke, 1996; Lett et al., 2002; Werme et al., 2002; Rhodes et al., 2003; Vargas-\nPerez et al., 2003): once they have experienced it, they like it. \n \n \n10. Summarizing conclusions \n \nGenerally, the scientific discussion on behaviour needs, or preferably behavioural priorities, of \nanimals, is still an ongoing process. In the present review paper, it was chosen to elucidate some \ntopics that might be of importance in the discussion on behavioural needs, and that might be \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 21\n729 \n730 \n731 \n732 \n733 \n734 \n735 \n736 \n737 \n738 \n739 \n740 \n741 \n742 \n743 \n744 \n745 \n746 \n747 \n748 \n749 \n750 \n751 \n752 \n753 \n754 \n755 \n756 \n757 \n758 \n759 \n760 \n761 \n762 \n763 \n764 \n765 \n766 \nfruitful in the discussion on the interpretation of farmed minks\u2019 motivation for a water bath. This \npaper, therefore, addressed some physiological and behavioural indicators on welfare, and \ndiscussed the topic of internally motivation and rewarding properties of behavioural displays, \nrebound effects and vacuum activities, preferences for, and the value of resources, effects of \npreventing the performance of (rewarding) behaviours and prior experience, substitutability of \nalternative resources and a \u2018positive indicator\u2019 of welfare, i.e. play behaviour.  \nThe present mink studies as reviewed in this paper appear a useful source to give insight \ninto minks\u2019 motivation for a swimming bath, but are rather complementally than comparable. \nHence, each study contributes to unravel the question on farmed mink\u2019s motivation for a water \nbath.  In short, the general main conclusions are:  \n1) Although not total conclusively, the meaning of a water bath for mink is most likely related to \nforaging behaviour (foraging areas: land and water). \n2) The absence of swimming water, without prior experience, causes no consistent significant \nalterations in levels of abnormal behaviour indicative for chronic stress, or into increased levels of \nanticipatory reactivity. \n3) The deprivation of a previously experienced water bath may induce short-term stress as \nindicated by enhanced levels of behavioural parameters (\u2018scratching\u2019 and \u2018scrabbling\u2019: Korhonen \net al., 2003; Warburton and Mason, 2006, p. 77) and a physiological parameter (cortisol in Mason \net al., 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003). \n4) Addressing rewarding properties in consumer-demand tests: mink work hard for access to a \nswimming bath and running wheel. The properties of other cage enrichments (e.g. tunnels, biting \nobjects), however, should not be neglected if they are provided under otherwise poor conditions, \nand because they may satisfy other motivational aspects of mink. \n5) Individual differences in the appraisal for swimming water clearly exist: eventually due to prior \nexperience or elicited by so far unknown cues. In this case, the resource should be considered as \nmore or less important for a particular individual. \n6) Swimming water seems not an \"innate\" or biological need in the sense of absolute distinction \nbetween \u201cneed\u201d or \u201cno need\u201d. It is most likely that swimming water is an incentive that induces its \nown motivation (\u201cincentive induced need\u201d). \nIn general, the provision of cage enrichments for farmed mink should be focussed on \nvariability and choices (see Hansen et al., 2007). Pragmatically it should be considered to focus \nmore on relevant alternative cage enrichments with a potential to improve minks\u2019 welfare, as \nthese are much easier to apply in practice than swimming water. The following topics might be of \ninterest for future studies: detection if particular cues in mink farming practice may elicit mink's \nmotivation to swim (e.g. drink water delivery systems) and the effects of prior experience with the \nincentive (\u201ccan you miss what you never experienced?\u201d). Furthermore, more attention should be \npaid on the parameter \u2018\u2019stereotypy\u2019\u2019, at least studies should address the following topics: 1) the \nlevel of stereotypies in their experimental populations at the start of the study, but preferably one \n  AABS revision 28-5-2010  \n    \n 22\n767 \n768 \n769 \n770 \n771 \n772 \n773 \n774 \n775 \n776 \n777 \n778 \n779 \n780 \n781 \n782 \n783 \n784 \nshould start with a non-stereotyping population; 2) attention should be paid to give insight into \nwinter food regimes and their interfering influence on the results: e.g. correlations with body \nweights and applying ad libitum regimes during the studies. \nMay other areas of interest as they were less presented in the available studies or only one \nstudy addressed this topic, are: rebound effects and vacuum activities (which could not be shown \nin the present studies), preferences for and the value of alternative resources, substitutability of \nalternative resources, \u2018positive indicators\u2019 of welfare (i.e. play behaviour, anticipatory behaviour), \nthe effects of preventing the performance of rewarding behaviours (deprivation of a previous \nexperienced resource) and the hygiene of a water bath. Surplus values on information in future \npapers would be the actual percentages of animals using a water bath during the experiment and \nthe use of power analyses.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful for the establishment of the Fur Animal Welfare Research Committee (FAWRC) as \nrecommended by the Council of Europe.
