More recently, however, clinicians have become more aware of the \nassociation between milder degrees of renal dysfunction and cardiac morbidity and \nmortality.  \n \nThere are several reasons for an increased interest in the relationship between kidney \nand cardiovascular disease. An ageing population with an increased prevalence of \nobesity, hypertension and diabetes has resulted in rising levels of chronic renal \ndisease. Among 6,233 participants in the Framingham Heart Study, 8% had mild renal \ninsufficiency based on measures of serum creatinine.2 Likewise, the third National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that, in the United States, almost \n10% of men and 2% of women have creatinine levels of 1.5mg\/dL (~133\u00b5mol\/L) or \ngreater.3\n \nThe association between renal impairment and cardiovascular outcome has also been \nemphasised in recent reports by several authoritative working groups. These, \ncombined with several large cohort studies, have highlighted the problem and \nconfirmed the importance of renal dysfunction in multiple patient populations. \n \nAnother factor may be the increasing utilisation of more precise estimates of renal \nfunction. In particular, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula allows \n 2\nestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on the basis of a patient's age, serum \ncreatinine, gender and racial background - facilitating its use in everyday clinical \npractice. If the estimated GFR is used many more individuals will be identified as \nhaving chronic renal insufficiency. For example, in this issue of the Journal, \nHolzmann and colleagues demonstrate that, in a cohort of 6,575 patients undergoing \nisolated first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 21% would be identified as \nhaving chronic kidney disease on the basis of an estimated GFR <60mL\/min\/1.73m2. \nOnly 6% of patients would have been identified as having renal dysfunction using the \ncommonly accepted cut-off of creatinine >1.5mg\/dL.4 Thus, the estimated GFR \nallows clinicians to make a much more precise estimate of kidney function - \nidentifying subtle, but prognostically important, renal impairment. As one would \nexpect, estimated GFR is, therefore, a better discriminator of risk than serum \ncreatinine, and is now generally accepted as the preferred measure in this context. \n \nRenal dysfunction in patients undergoing myocardial revascularisation \nDuring myocardial revascularisation even mild degrees of renal dysfunction are \nincreasingly recognised as a key prognostic indicator. Several studies have \ndemonstrated that end-stage renal failure predicts a worse outcome from CABG. A \npoorer prognosis has also been described among patients with renal dysfunction not \nrequiring dialysis. Most such studies have included patients with moderate to severe \nelevations of creatinine, dichotomised on the basis of largely arbitrary cut-off levels. \nRecently, several authors have demonstrated that milder degrees of renal impairment, \nidentified using the estimated GFR, are also important determinants of outcome.5,6 \nOne such study is published in this issue of the Journal. As noted above, Holzmann \nand colleagues studied patients undergoing isolated first CABG at the Karolinska \n 3\nHospital, Stockholm between 1980 and 1995. Their principal finding was that, even \nafter correction for confounding variables, the hazard of death and\/or myocardial \ninfarction increased as the estimated GFR fell: an association that was similar in both \nmen and women.4 Interestingly, the percentage of patients with chronic kidney \ndisease (<60mL\/min\/1.73m2) undergoing CABG between 1990 and 1995 (26%) was \ndouble that among those operated on between 1980 and 1984 (13%).4 Importantly, \nthis study excluded an additional 136 patients who died within the initial 30-days of \nsurgery, and does not assess the impact of renal function on early outcome after \nCABG. Other recent data confirm that estimated GFR is a very powerful, \nindependent, predictor of early morbidity and mortality.5,6\n \nRenal dysfunction is also an important determinant of outcome following \npercutaneous coronary intervention where, as in patients undergoing CABG, even \nmild impairment is associated with a considerable increase in 1-year mortality, \nindependent of other factors.7 Studies in the 1990s suggested that patients with severe \nkidney disease treated with balloon angioplasty had a poor procedural outcome and \nhigh restenosis rates. More recent data suggest that in patients with milder degrees of \nrenal dysfunction, treated predominantly with intra-coronary stents, rates of restenosis \nand acute myocardial infarction are no higher than those with normal renal function \nafter an average follow-up of 9 months.8\n \nRelationship between estimated GFR and outcome \nHolzmann and colleagues did not specifically address the pattern of the relationship \nbetween declining GFR and outcome. Their data are, however, in keeping with the \nobservations of others that the risk is non-linear.5,6 A GFR of 90mL\/min\/1.73m2 or \n 4\nabove is regarded as normal. Patients at high-risk of, or with pre-existing, \ncardiovascular disease who have mild renal dysfunction (estimated GFR 60-\n89mL\/min\/1.73m2) are at slightly increased risk of adverse events. There appears to \nbe a threshold effect whereby risk increases greatly as the estimated GFR falls below \n60mL\/min\/1.73m2 \u2013 the level at which a patient is regarded as having \u2018chronic kidney \ndisease\u2019 and at which the regulatory functions of the kidney begin to fail, with an \nassociated increase in the prevalence of \u2018renal-specific\u2019 cardiovascular risk factors \n(see below). \n \nMechanisms whereby pre-procedural renal function influences outcome from \nrevascularisation \nThe mechanisms whereby minor abnormalities in renal function mediate a worse \noutcome are complex. Renal function tends to decline with age and dysfunction is a \nconsequence of several conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes \nmellitus and hypertension. Likewise, impaired kidney function exacerbates the effects \nof these conditions, and in addition is associated with dyslipidaemia plus a variety of \nother less well-defined risk factors such as increased acute phase proteins, reduced \nantioxidants and hyperhomocysteinaemia. It has been suggested that reductions in \nhaemoglobin and abnormalities of calcium\/phosphate homeostatis might also be \ncontributory and, although more pronounced in advanced renal disease, such changes \ncan be observed in patients with relatively modest reductions in GFR.  \n \nRenal dysfunction is a common consequence of reduced left ventricular systolic \nfunction and heart failure. This, most likely, reflects a combination of factors \nincluding the direct relationship between impaired haemodynamic status and renal \n 5\nfunction, neurohormonal activation, effects of medications and the results of the \nunderlying disease processes. Not only can left ventricular impairment result in \nreduced renal function, but the converse may also occur: chronic kidney disease is \nitself a risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation and dysfunction. \n \nIn summary, therefore, the powerful prognostic utility of renal function is assumed in \npart to be due to its association with, and exacerbation of, established and suspected \nrisk factors for accelerated atherosclerosis and left ventricular dysfunction. In \naddition, the kidney is particularly sensitive to the effects of generalised vascular \ndysfunction and haemodynamic disturbances\u2013 and may therefore serve as a useful \n\u2018barometer\u2019 of cardiovascular health. Finally, there are extensive data demonstrating \nthat patients with even mild renal impairment are less likely to receive therapies that \ncan improve cardiac outcome. \n \nEffects of post-procedural renal function on outcome \nRelatively few studies have assessed the impact of post-operative renal function on \nlong-term outcome. Those data that are available confirm that pre-operative renal \nimpairment is a major predictor of peri-procedural deterioration and that, both after \nCABG and PCI, this is associated with a worse outcome.9,10 Indeed, in this setting, \neven relatively minor changes predict a higher mortality. The mechanisms underlying \nthis are poorly defined but may include a decreased renal reserve (with increased \nsusceptibility to the effects haemodynamic compromise), worse underlying cardiac \ndisease, a higher prevalence of diabetes, increased age and poorer systolic function or \nclinical heart failure. In addition, renal dysfunction is a common consequence of \n 6\nmany other post-operative complications \u2013 such as sepsis \u2013 that in turn have profound \nimplications for outcome. \n \nClinical implications \nThe data presented by Holzmann and colleagues add to the growing literature \ndemonstrating that renal dysfunction, particularly when measured accurately using the \nestimated GFR, is a potent predictor of outcome following CABG. The underlying \nmechanisms are multifaceted and include both direct and indirect effects. It appears, \nhowever, that renal dysfunction can be regarded both as a marker and a mediator of \nincreased risk. \n \nDespite the impact of kidney disease on the outcome from CABG, current risk-\nprediction models in cardiac surgery either exclude renal function altogether, or rely \non serum creatinine used as a dichotomous variable, the need for renal replacement \ntherapy or poorly-defined criteria such as \u2018renal failure\u2019. Further work is required to \nassess whether the inclusion of more discriminatory measures of renal function might \nresult in improved pre-operative risk stratification. Increased use of the estimated \nGFR would also increase the recognition of otherwise unapparent renal dysfunction \nand, hopefully, encourage the use of therapies already proven to improve \ncardiovascular outcome. Ultimately, prospective studies are required to devise \nstrategies that reduce the risk associated with renal dysfunction in this setting. \n 7\nReferences \n1.
