Each of these payoff flows is an additive functional of a general\none-dimensional Ito\u02c6 diffusion. There are no bounds on the number or on the frequency of\nthe times at which the decision maker can switch, but each switching incurs a cost, which\nmay depend on the underlying diffusion. The objective of the decision maker is to select\na sequence of switching times that maximises the associated expected discounted payoff\nflow. In this context, we develop and study a model in the presence of assumptions that\ninvolve minimal smoothness requirements from the running payoff and switching cost\nfunctions, but which guarantee that the optimal strategies have relatively simple forms.\nIn particular, we derive a complete and explicit characterisation of the decision maker\u2019s\noptimal tactics, which can take qualitatively different forms, depending on the problem\ndata.\nKeywords: optimal switching, sequential entry and exit decisions, stochastic impulse\ncontrol, system of variational inequalities\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications: 93E20, (49K45,60G40,91B28,91B70)\n1 Introduction\nThe origins of the problem that we study are located in economics. Indeed, consider a manager\nwho lives in an economy that is driven by a one-dimensional Ito\u02c6 diffusion. This manager can\nswitch, at a cost, between two investment modes that are associated with different payoff flows\nand are dependent on the state of the economy. One of these investment modes is preferable\n\u2217Research supported by EPSRC grant nos.GR\/S22998\/01, EP\/C508882\/1\n\u2020Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences and Department of Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics,\nHeriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK, t.c.johnson@hw.ac.uk\n\u2021Department of Mathematics, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK,\nm.zervos@lse.ac.uk\n1\nwhen the economic environment is poor, while the other one is preferable when the economic\nenvironment is positive. The manager has an infinite time horizon and wishes to maximise\ntheir expected discounted payoff flow by switching between the two investment modes. For\ninstance, the manager may be switching between an asset with stochastic price dynamics and\na bank account, or may be the operator of a production facility that can be shut down when\nit is not sufficiently profitable.\nTo fix ideas, we assume that the economy is driven by the one-dimensional Ito\u02c6 diffusion\ndXt = b(Xt) dt+ \u03c3(Xt) dWt, X0 = x \u2208 I, (1)\nwhere W is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, and I = ]\u03b1, \u03b2[ is a given interval.\nIn particular, we consider a stochastic system that can be operated in two modes, say \u201copen\u201d\nand \u201cclosed\u201d. We use the controlled finite variation process Z that takes values in {0, 1} to\nkeep track of the system\u2019s operating mode over time. In particular, if Zt = 1 (resp., Zt = 0),\nthen the system is in its open (resp., closed) operating mode at time t, while, the jumps of Z\noccur at the sequence of times (Tn) when the decision maker switches the system between its\ntwo operating modes. Assuming that the system is initially in operating mode z \u2208 {0, 1}, the\ndecision maker\u2019s objective is to select a switching strategy Zz,x that maximises the performance\ncriterion\nJ\u02dc(Zz,x) = lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\nEx\n[ \u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt dA\nho\nt +\n\u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039bt(1\u2212 Zt) dA\nhc\nt\n\u2212\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212\u039bTj\n[\ngo(XTj)1{\u2206ZTj=1} + gc(XTj )1{\u2206ZTj=\u22121}\n]\n1{Tj<\u221e}\n]\n. (2)\nThe additive functionals Aho and Ahc model the running payoff flows that the system yields\nwhile it is operated in its open and in its closed operating modes, respectively, the functions\ngo and gc provide the costs of switching the system from its closed to its open operating mode\nand vice versa, while the state-dependent discounting factor \u039b is defined by\n\u039bt =\n\u222b t\n0\nr(Xs) ds, (3)\nfor some function r > 0. The precise definition of the additive functionals Aho and Ahc , which\nare parametrised by the measures ho and hc, is given by (14) below.\nIt is worth noting at this point that our assumptions on the problem data imply that, given\nany admissible switching strategy, the \u201clim inf\u201d in (2) can be replaced by \u201clim\u201d (see (35) in\nRemark 1 and (41) in Section 3). Also, there exist functions Rhc and Rh such that\nJ\u02dc(Zz,x) = Rhc(x) + zRh(x) + lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nEx\n[ n\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212\u039bTj\n[\n(Rh \u2212 go)(XTj )1{\u2206ZTj=1}\n\u2212 (Rh + gc)(XTj )1{\u2206ZTj=\u22121}\n]\n1{Tj<\u221e}\n]\n(4)\n2\n(see (35) in Remark 1 and (42) in Section 3). In this expression, the function Rh can be\ninterpreted as a measure for the accrual payoff differential resulting from having the system\nin its open rather than its closed operating mode. Furthermore, if the measures ho and hc are\nabsolutely continuous with Radon-Nikodym derivatives with respect to the Lebesgue measure\ndenoted by h\u02d9o and h\u02d9c, respectively, then the performance index J\u02dc defined by (2) admits the\nexpression\nJ\u02dc(Zz,x) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nEx\n[ \u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZth\u02d9o(Xt) dt+\n\u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039bt(1\u2212 Zt)h\u02d9c(Xt) dt\n\u2212\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212\u039bTj\n[\ngo(XTj)1{\u2206ZTj=1} + gc(XTj )1{\u2206ZTj=\u22121}\n]\n1{Tj<\u221e}\n]\n, (5)\nwhich is more familiar in the stochastic control literature (see Remark 1).\nProblems involving sequential entry and exit decisions have attracted considerable interest\nin the literature, particularly, in relation to the management of commodity production facili-\nties. Following Brennan and Schwartz [BS85], Dixit and Pindyck [DP94], and Trigeorgis [T96],\nwho were the first to address this type of a decision problem in the economics literature, Brekke\nand \u00d8ksendal [B\u00d894], Bronstein and Zervos [BZ06], Carmona and Ludkovski [CL05], Coste-\nniuc, Schnetzer and Taschini [CST08], Djehiche and Hamade`ne [DH08], Djehiche, Hamade`ne\nand Popier [DHP08], Duckworth and Zervos [DZ01], Guo and Pham [GP05], Guo and Tome-\ncek [GT08], Hamade`ne and Jeanblanc [HJ07], Lumley and Zervos [LZ01], Ly Vath and Pham\n[LVP01], Pham [P04], Porchet, Warin and Touzi [PTW06], and Zervos [Z03], provide an in-\ncomplete, alphabetically ordered, list of authors who have studied a number of related models\nby means of rigorous mathematics. The contributions of these authors range from explicit\nsolutions to characterisations of the associated value functions in terms of classical as well as\nviscosity solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, as well as\nin terms of backward stochastic differential equation characterisations of the optimal strate-\ngies.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2, which is composed by four parts, is mostly\nconcerned with the problem formulation. In Section 2.1, we discuss some of the notation\nthat we use throughout the paper, in Section 2.2, we develop our assumptions on the data\nof the underlying Ito\u02c6 diffusion defined by (1), in Section 2.3, we review a number of results\nregarding the solvability of a second order linear ODE on which our analysis relies, while, in\nSection 2.4, we complete the formulation of the control problem that we solve. Section 3 is\nconcerned with the well-posedness of our optimisation problem as well as with establishing\nclaims made above such as expression (4). In Section 4, we study a number of implications\nstemming from our Assumption 5 in Section 2.4. Indeed, Assumption 5 plays a central role in\nour analysis in the sense that it is this assumption that implies a relatively simple structure\nof the optimal strategies. In Section 5, we prove a verification theorem, which does not rely\non Assumption 5, and, in Section 6, we develop the explicit solution of our control problem.\nFinally, in Section 7, we consider a couple of examples that provide some illustration of our\nresults.\n3\n2 Problem formulation, assumptions and preliminary\nresults\n2.1 Notation\nWe denote by I a given open interval with left endpoint \u03b1 \u2265 \u2212\u221e and right endpoint \u03b2 \u2264 \u221e,\nand by B(I) the Borel \u03c3-algebra on I. Given a point c \u2208 I, we adopt the convention\n]c, c[ = ]c, c] = [c, c[ = \u2205. Also, when we consider sets A \u2286 I, we adopt the conventions\ninf A = \u03b2 and supA = \u03b1 if A = \u2205.\nThroughout the paper, we consider signed measures of \u03c3-finite total variation, and we refer\nto them as just \u201cmeasures\u201d. Given a measure \u00b5 on (I,B(I)) we denote by \u00b5+ and \u00b5\u2212 the\nunique positive measures on (I,B(I)) resulting from the Radon decomposition of \u00b5, so that\n\u00b5 = \u00b5+ \u2212 \u00b5\u2212 and |\u00b5| = \u00b5+ + \u00b5\u2212, where |\u00b5| is the total variation measure of \u00b5. We denote\nby supp \u00b5 the support of \u00b5. Also, we say that a measure \u00b5 on a measurable space (I\u00af,B(I\u00af)),\nwhere I\u00af \u2286 I and B(I\u00af) is the Borel \u03c3-algebra on I\u00af, has full-support if supp \u00b5 = I\u00af, and that it\nis non-atomic if \u00b5({c}) = 0, for all c \u2208 I\u00af.\nRecalling that a function f : I \u2192 R is the difference of two convex functions if and only\nif its second distributional derivative is a measure, we denote by f \u2032\u2212 and by f\n\u2032\n+ the left-hand\nside and the right-hand side first derivatives of f , respectively, which both are functions of\nfinite variation, and by f \u2032\u2032 the measure on (I,B(I)) corresponding to the second distributional\nderivative of f .\n2.2 The underlying Ito\u02c6 diffusion\nWe assume that the data of the one-dimensional Ito\u02c6 diffusion given by (1) in the introduction\nsatisfy the following assumption.\nAssumption 1 The functions b, \u03c3 : I \u2192 R are B(I)-measurable,\n\u03c32(x) > 0, for all x \u2208 I,\nand\n\u222b \u03b2\n\u03b1\n1 + |b(s)|\n\u03c32(s)\nds <\u221e and sup\ns\u2208[\u03b1,\u03b2]\n\u03c32(s) <\u221e, for all \u03b1 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03b2.\n\u0003\nWith reference to Karatzas and Shreve [KS91, Section 5.5.C], the conditions appearing in this\nassumption are sufficient for the SDE (1) to have a weak solution Sx = (\u2126,F ,Ft,Px,W,X)\nthat is unique in the sense of probability law up to a possible explosion time, for all initial\nconditions x \u2208 I. In particular, given c \u2208 I, the scale function pc and the speed measure m,\n4\ngiven by\npc(x) =\n\u222b x\nc\nexp\n(\n\u22122\n\u222b s\nc\nb(u)\n\u03c32(u)\ndu\n)\nds, for x \u2208 I,\nm(dx) =\n2\n\u03c32(x)p\u2032(x)\ndx,\nwhich characterise one-dimensional diffusions, are well-defined. We also assume that the\nsolution of (1) in non-explosive, i.e., the hitting time of the boundary {\u03b1, \u03b2} of the interval I\nis infinite with probability 1 (see Karatzas and Shreve [KS91, Theorem 5.5.29] for appropriate\nnecessary and sufficient analytic conditions).\nAssumption 2 The solution of (1) is non-explosive. \u0003\nRelative to the discounting factor \u039b defined by (3), we make the following assumption.\nAssumption 3 The function r : I \u2192 ]0,\u221e[ is B(I)-measurable and locally bounded. Also,\nthere exists r0 > 0 such that r(x) \u2265 r0, for all x \u2208 I. \u0003\n2.3 The solution of an associated ODE\nIn the presence of Assumptions 1, 2 and 3, the general solution of the second-order linear\nhomogeneous ODE\n1\n2\n\u03c32(x)f \u2032\u2032(x) + b(x)f \u2032(x)\u2212 r(x)f(x) = 0, x \u2208 I,\nexists in the classical sense and is given by\nf(x) = A\u03c6(x) +B\u03c8(x),\nfor some constants A,B \u2208 R. The functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 are C1, their first derivatives are\nabsolutely continuous functions,\n0 < \u03c6(x) and \u03c6\u2032(x) < 0, for all x \u2208 I, (6)\n0 < \u03c8(x) and \u03c8\u2032(x) > 0, for all x \u2208 I, (7)\nand\nlim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n\u03c6(x) = lim\nx\u2191\u03b2\n\u03c8(x) =\u221e. (8)\nIn this context, \u03c6 and \u03c8 are unique, modulo multiplicative constants, and the scale function\npc admits the expression\np\u2032c(x) =\n\u03c6(x)\u03c8\u2032(x)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032(x)\u03c8(x)\n\u03c6(c)\u03c8\u2032(c)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032(c)\u03c8(c)\n=\nW(x)\nW(c)\n, for all x, c \u2208 I, (9)\n5\nwhere W > 0 is the Wronskian of the functions \u03c6 and \u03c8. Also, given any points x1 < x2 in I\nand weak solutions Sx1 , Sx2 of the SDE (1), the functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 satisfy\n\u03c6(x2) = \u03c6(x1)Ex2\n[\ne\u2212\u039b\u03c4x1\n]\nand \u03c8(x1) = \u03c8(x2)Ex1\n[\ne\u2212\u039b\u03c4x2\n]\n. (10)\nHere, as well as in the rest of the paper, we denote by \u03c4\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is any point in I, the first\nhitting time of {\u03b3}, which is defined by\n\u03c4\u03b3 = {t \u2265 0 | Xt = \u03b3} .\nAll of these claims are standard, and can be found in various forms in several references,\nincluding Feller [F52], Breiman [B68], Ito\u02c6 and McKean [IM74], Karlin and Taylor [KT81],\nRogers and Williams [RW00], and Borodin and Salminen [BS02].\nTo proceed further, we consider the solvability of the non-homogeneous ODE\nLR\u00b5 + \u00b5 = 0, (11)\nwhere \u00b5 is a measure on (I,B(I)) and the measure-valued operator L is defined by\nLf(dx) =\n1\n2\n\u03c32(x)f \u2032\u2032(dx) + b(x)f \u2032\u2212(x) dx\u2212 r(x)f(x) dx (12)\non the space of all functions f : I \u2192 R that are differences of two convex functions (see also\nSection 2.1 above). Also, we recall Definition 2.5 from Johnson and Zervos [JZ07].\nDefinition 1 The space I\u03c6,\u03c8 is defined to be the set of all measures \u00b5 on (I,B(I)) such that\u222b\n]\u03b1,\u03b3[\n\u03a8(s) |\u00b5|(ds) +\n\u222b\n[\u03b3,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s) |\u00b5|(ds) <\u221e, for all \u03b3 \u2208 I,\nwhere the functions \u03a6 and \u03a8 are defined by\n\u03a6(x) =\n\u03c6(x)\n\u03c32(x)W(x)\nand \u03a8(x) =\n\u03c8(x)\n\u03c32(x)W(x)\n. (13)\nI\u03c6,\u03c8 is called the space of (\u03c6, \u03c8)-integrable measures. \u0003\nFor the rest of this section, we fix a weak solution Sx = (\u2126,F ,Ft,Px,W,X) of (1), and we\nconsider the linear functional \u00b5 7\u2192 A\u00b5 mapping the family of all \u03c3-finite measures \u00b5 into the\nset of finite variation, continuous processes A\u00b5 defined by\nA\u00b5t =\n\u222b \u03b2\n\u03b1\nLyt\n\u03c32(y)\n\u00b5(dy), (14)\nwhere Ly is the local-time process of X at y \u2208 I. It is straightforward to see that the total\nvariation process |A\u00b5| of A\u00b5 is given by |A\u00b5| = A|\u00b5|, and that\nif \u00b5 is a positive measure, then A\u00b5 is an increasing process, (15)\n6\nbecause Ly is an increasing process, for all y \u2208 I. Also,\u222b \u221e\n0\n1\u0393(t) dA\n|\u00b5|\nt = 0, for all countable sets \u0393 \u2282 I, (16)\nbecause A\u00b5 has continuous sample paths.\nThe following results, which we will need, have been established by Johnson and Zer-\nvos [JZ07]. A measure \u00b5 belongs to I\u03c6,\u03c8 if and only if\nEx\n[\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u039bt dA\n|\u00b5|\nt\n]\n<\u221e, for all x \u2208 I.

(20)\nNoting that \u2212LR\u00b5 = \u00b5, we can see that, if R\u2212LR\u00b5 is defined as in (18)\u2013(19) with \u2212LR\u00b5 in\nplace of \u00b5, then\nR\u2212LR\u00b5 = R\u00b5.

Furthermore, if\n\u03b1 (resp., \u03b2) is a natural boundary point, i.e., if\nlim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n\u03c8(x) = 0\n(\nresp., lim\nx\u2191\u03b2\n\u03c6(x) = 0\n)\n,\nthen\nlim\nx\u2193\u03b1\nRh(x) = lim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n\u00b5\u02d9(x)\nr(x)\n(\nresp., lim\nx\u2191\u03b2\nRh(x) = lim\nx\u2191\u03b2\n\u00b5\u02d9(x)\nr(x)\n)\n. (30)\nThese limits are not necessarily true if, e.g., \u03b1 is an entrance boundary point (an example\nillustrating this is given by the function Rh in Section 7.2).\n2.4 The objective of the optimisation problem\nWe adopt a weak formulation of the optimal control problem that we solve.\nDefinition 2 Given an initial condition (z, x) \u2208 {0, 1}\u00d7 I, an admissible switching strategy,\nis any collection Zz,x = (Sx, Z, Tn) such that\n(I ) Sx = (\u2126,F ,Ft,Px, X,W ) is a weak solution of the SDE (1),\n(II ) Z is an (Ft)-adapted, finite variation, ca`gla`d process with values in {0, 1}, and such that\nZ0 = z, and\n(III ) (Tn) is the strictly increasing sequence of (Ft)-stopping times at which the jumps of Z\noccur, which can be defined recursively by\nT1 = inf{t > 0 | Zt 6= z} and Tj+1 = inf{t > Tj | Zt 6= ZTj}, for j = 1, 2, . . . , (31)\nwith the usual convention that inf \u2205 =\u221e.\nWe denote by Az,x the set of all admissible strategies. \u0003\n8\nWith each admissible switching strategy, we associate the performance criterion\nJ(Zz,x) = Ex\n[\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt dA\nh\nt\n]\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nEx\n[\ne\u2212\u039bTn\n[\ngo(XTn)1{\u2206ZTn=1} + gc(XTn)1{\u2206ZTn=\u22121}\n]\n1{Tn<\u221e}\n]\n. (32)\nThe objective of the control problem is to maximise J(Zz,x) over all admissible Zz,x. Accord-\ningly, we define the value function v by\nv(z, x) = sup\nZz,x\u2208Az,x\nJ(Zz,x), for z \u2208 {0, 1} and x \u2208 I.\nTo ensure that our optimisation problem is well-posed, we make the following assumption.\nIt is worth observing that among the other conditions, (33) has a simple economic inter-\npretation because it excludes the possibility of generating arbitrarily high profits by rapidly\nswitching between the system\u2019s two operating modes.\nAssumption 4 Each of the functions gc, go : I \u2192 R is the difference of two convex functions,\nand\ngc(x) + go(x) > 0, for all x \u2208 I. (33)\nThe measures Lgc, Lgo and h are (\u03c6, \u03c8)-integrable,\ngc = R\u2212Lgc and go = R\u2212Lgo, (34)\nwhere R\u2212Lgc and R\u2212Lgo are defined as in (18)\u2013(19). \u0003\nRemark 1 The structure of the performance criterion defined by (32) involves a running\npayoff flow only when the system is in its open operating mode. We have chosen this setting\ninstead of the apparently more general one involving the performance index J\u02dc defined by (2)\nin the introduction, only with a view to simplifying the presentation of our results. Indeed,\nassuming that both of ho and hc are (\u03c6, \u03c8)-integrable, the linearity of the mapping \u00b5 7\u2192 A\n\u00b5\nand (18) implies that\nJ\u02dc(Zz,x) = Ex\n[\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u039bt dAhct\n]\n+ J(Zz,x) = Rhc(x) + J(Zz,x), for all Zz,x \u2208 Az,x, (35)\nif we let h = ho \u2212 hc, which reveals that the two optimisation problems are equivalent.\nFurthermore, it is worth noting at this point that the expression (5) of J\u02dc that arises when ho\nand hc absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure follows immediately from\n(29). \u0003\nThe next assumption, which involves the functions \u2212(Rh + gc) and Rh \u2212 go appearing in\nthe expression of the performance criterion given by (4) in the introduction, ensures that the\noptimal strategies of the optimisation problem that we study admit an explicit characterisa-\ntion.\n9\nAssumption 5 The measure L(Rh + gc) satisfies one of the following mutually exclusive\nconditions:\nA1.\n\u2223\u2223L(Rh + gc)\u2223\u2223(I) = 0;\nA2.\n\u2223\u2223L(Rh + gc)\u2223\u2223(I) > 0, and \u2212L(Rh + gc) is a positive measure;\nA3.\n\u2223\u2223L(Rh + gc)\u2223\u2223(I) > 0, and L(Rh + gc) is a positive measure;\nA4.\n\u2223\u2223L(Rh + gc)\u2223\u2223(I) > 0, supp[L(Rh + gc)]+ 6= \u2205, supp[L(Rh + gc)]\u2212 6= \u2205, and there exists a\npoint a\u02dc \u2208 I such that\nsupp[L(Rh + gc)]\n+ \u2286 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ and supp[L(Rh + gc)]\n\u2212 \u2286 [a\u02dc, \u03b2[.

(40)\n\u0003\nThe previous assumptions are sufficient for the existence of an optimal strategy, which is\nnot in general unique. To address uniqueness issues, we have to make additional assumptions,\nwhich are captured by the following conditions.\n10\nAssumption 6 Cases A1 and B1 cannot occur.

(42)\nProof. We fix any initial condition (z, x) \u2208 {0, 1} \u00d7 I and any admissible switching strategy\nZz,x \u2261\n(\nSx, Z, Tn\n)\n\u2208 Az,x, and we note that limn\u2192\u221e Tn = \u221e, Px-a.s., because Z is a finite\nvariation process whose jumps all have size 1. Recalling that the total variation process |Ah|\nof Ah is equal to A|h|, we note that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt dA\nh\nt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264\n\u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt d\n\u2223\u2223Aht \u2223\u2223 =\n\u222b Tn\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt dA\n|h|\nt \u2264\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u039btZt dA\n|h|\nt .\nThe last term in these inequalities has finite expectation thanks to the assumption that the\nmeasure h is (\u03c6, \u03c8)-integrable and (17).

The proof of (82) follows symmetric arguments.\nTo see (83), we note that (36) in Assumption 5 and (53) or (55) imply that\nlim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n\u222b\n[x,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2208 ]\u2212\u221e, 0], (85)\nand\n0 \u2264\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) <\u221e, for all x \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[.\nCombining these inequalities, with the identity \u03a6 = \u03c6\u03a8\/\u03c8 that follows from (13), and the fact\nthat the function \u03c6\/\u03c8 is decreasing, we can see that\n\u221e >\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x[\n\u03a8(s)\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03c8(s)\nL(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2265\n\u03c6(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2265 0,\n18\nfor all x \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[.

The proof of (84) follows similar reasoning. \u0003\n5 A verification theorem\nIn view of the existing theory on similar stochastic control problems, we expect that, when\nthe problem data are smooth functions, the value function v identifies with a classical solution\nw of the HJB equation that takes the form of the coupled quasi-variational inequalities\nmax\n{\n1\n2\n\u03c32(x)wxx(z, x) + b(x)wx(z, x)\u2212 r(x)w(z, x) + zh\u02d9(x),\nw(1\u2212 z, x)\u2212 w(z, x)\u2212 zgc(x)\u2212 (1\u2212 z)go(x)\n}\n= 0, (86)\nwhich are parametrised by z = 0, 1. In the case that we consider in this paper, we do not\nassume that the problem data are smooth, so, we have to consider generalised solutions of\n(86).\nDefinition 3 A function w : {0, 1} \u00d7 I 7\u2192 R is a solution of the HJB equation (86) if w(z, \u00b7)\nis the difference of two convex functions,\n\u2212Lw(z, \u00b7)\u2212 zh is a positive measure on (I,B(I)), (87)\nw(1\u2212 z, x)\u2212 w(z, x)\u2212 zgc(x)\u2212 (1\u2212 z)go(x) \u2264 0, for all x \u2208 I, (88)\nfor z = 0 as well as for z = 1, and\nLw(0, \u00b7)(Cc) = Lw(1, \u00b7)(Co) + h(Co) = 0, (89)\nwhere the operator L is defined by (12), and Cc and Co are the open sets defined by\nCc =\n{\nx \u2208 I | w(0, x) > w(1, x)\u2212 go(x)\n}\n, (90)\nCo =\n{\nx \u2208 I | w(1, x) > w(0, x)\u2212 gc(x)\n}\n. (91)\n\u0003\n19\nIn the context of this definition, we can make the following observations that are motivated\nby the existing literature in the area and link the four components composing (86) to optimal\ndecision tactics. The sets Cc and Co are the so-called \u201ccontinuation\u201d regions associated with\nthe system in its closed and its open operating modes, respectively. For instance, the decision\nmaker should take no action if the system is in its closed mode and the state process X assumes\nvalues inside Cc. In view of (89) and Section 2.3, a solution of the HJB equation (86) should\nbe given by\nw(0, x) = Ac\u03c6(x) +Bc\u03c8(x)\nand\nw(1, x) = Ao\u03c6(x) +Bo\u03c8(x) +Rh(x),\nfor some constants Ac, Bc, Ao, Bo \u2208 R, which may depend on the relative location of x in I.\nOn the other hand, the sets I \\ Cc and I \\ Co characterise the part of the state space in which\nthe decision maker should take action. In particular, if, at any given time t, the system is in\nits closed (resp., open) mode and Xt \u2208 I \\ Cc (resp., Xt \u2208 I \\ Co), then the system\u2019s controller\nshould switch the system from its closed (resp., open) mode to its open (resp., closed) one.\nThe following result is concerned with sufficient conditions for a solution of (86) to identify\nwith the value function of our control problem.\nTheorem 3 Consider the stochastic control problem formulated in Section 2, and suppose\nthat Assumptions 1\u20134 hold. If a function w : {0, 1} \u00d7 I 7\u2192 R satisfies the HJB equation (86)\nin the sense of Definition 3,\nthe measures Lw(0, \u00b7) and Lw(1, \u00b7) are (\u03c6, \u03c8)-integrable, (92)\nand \u2223\u2223w(z, \u00b7)\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C (1 + |Rh|+ |go|+ |gc|) , (93)\nfor some constant C > 0, for z = 0, 1, then the following statements hold true:\n(a) v(z, x) \u2264 w(z, x), for every (z, x) \u2208 {0, 1} \u00d7 I, and\n(b) given an initial condition (z, x) \u2208 {0, 1}\u00d7I, if there exists an admissible switching strategy\nZ\n\u2217\nz,x \u2261 (S\n\u2217\nx, Z\n\u2217, T \u2217n) \u2208 Az,x such that the random sets\n{t \u2265 0 | Z\u2217t = 0 and X\n\u2217\nt \u2208 I \\ Cc} and {t \u2265 0 | Z\n\u2217\nt = 1 and X\n\u2217\nt \u2208 I \\ Co} (94)\nboth are countable,\n{t \u2265 0 | \u2206Z\u2217t = 1} \u2286 {t \u2265 0 | X\n\u2217\nt \u2208 I \\ Cc} (95)\nand\n{t \u2265 0 | \u2206Z\u2217t = \u22121} \u2286 {t \u2265 0 | X\n\u2217\nt \u2208 I \\ Co} , (96)\nP\n\u2217\nx-a.s., then w(z, x) = J(Z\n\u2217\nz,x) = v(z, x) and Z\n\u2217\nz,x is an optimal strategy.\n20\nProof.

Recalling (16), we can see that, in this\ncase, (104) holds with equality, thanks to (88)\u2013(89). In view of (41), we can then pass to the\nlimit as n\u2192\u221e to obtain J(Z\u22171,x) = w(1, x), which implies that v(1, x) \u2265 w(1, x). Combining\nthis conclusion with the inequality v(1, x) \u2264 w(1, x), which we have established above, we can\nsee that v(1, x) = w(1, x) and that Z\u22171,x is optimal. \u0003\n6 The solution of the control problem\nWe now solve our control problem by constructing an explicit solution of the HJB equation (86)\nthat satisfies the requirements of Theorem 3. To this end, we consider the various qualitatively\ndifferent forms that the optimal switching strategy may take, guided by the discussion following\nDefinition 3 and by (97) that is required by the verification theorem proved in the previous\nsection.\nTo start with, the optimal strategy could involve no switchings, that is, it might be optimal\nto always leave the system in its original operating mode. In this case, the choice\nw(0, \u00b7) = 0 and w(1, \u00b7) = Rh, (105)\nshould provide the required solution of (86). A second possibility arises when it is optimal to\nirreversibly switch the system to its open operating mode at time 0, in which case,\nw(0, \u00b7) = Rh \u2212 go and w(1, \u00b7) = Rh, (106)\nshould satisfy (86). Similarly, it might be optimal to irreversibly switch the system to its\nclosed operating mode at time 0, which is associated with a solution of (86) of the form\nw(0, \u00b7) = 0 and w(1, \u00b7) = \u2212gc. (107)\nThe following result, the proof of which we develop in the appendix, is concerned with condi-\ntions under which (105)\u2013(107) indeed provide a solution of the HJB equation (86).\n23\nLemma 4 In the presence of Assumptions 1\u20135, the following statements are true:\n(I) The function w given by (105) satisfies the HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3\nif and only if the problem data are such that any of the pairs in Group NA of Table 1 occurs.\n(II) The function w given by (106) satisfies the HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3\nif the problem data are such that any of the pairs in Group O of Table 1 occurs.\n(III) The function w given by (107) satisfies the HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3\nif the problem data are such that any of the pairs in Group C of Table 1 occurs.\nFurthermore, if Assumption 6 also holds true, then each of the above statements is true if and\nonly if the problem data is such that one of the pairs in the corresponding groups of Table 2\noccurs.\nDeparting from the consideration of strategies that have the simple structures considered\nabove, the next possibility that arises is when it is optimal to wait before permanently switch-\ning the system to its open operating mode. In this case, we look for a point bo \u2208 I such that,\nif the system is in its closed operating mode at time 0, then it is optimal to wait as long as\nthe state process assumes values in the interval ]\u03b1, bo[, and permanently switch the system to\nits open operating mode as soon as the state process hits the interval [bo, \u03b2[. In this case, we\nlook for a solution of the HJB equation (86) of the form given by\nw(0, x) =\n{\nB\u03c8(x), if x \u2208 ]\u03b1, bo[,\nRh(x)\u2212 go(x), if x \u2208 [bo, \u03b2[,\nand w(1, x) = Rh, (108)\nfor some constant B. To determine the parameter B and the free-boundary point bo, we\nconjecture that the inequalities\nB\u03c8(bo) = Rh(bo)\u2212 go(bo) (109)\nand\n(Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n+(bo) \u2264 B\u03c8\n\u2032(bo) \u2264 (Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n\u2212(bo), (110)\nshould hold. Indeed, these inequalities are the generalisation of the so-called \u201cprinciple of\nsmooth fit\u201d that is appropriate for the analysis of our problem. Solving (109) for B and\nsubstituting for it into (110), we can see that the point bo should satisfy the inequalities\n\u03c8(bo)(Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n+(bo)\u2212 \u03c8\n\u2032(bo)(Rh \u2212 go)(bo) \u2264 0,\n\u03c8(bo)(Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n\u2212(bo)\u2212 \u03c8\n\u2032(bo)(Rh \u2212 go)(bo) \u2265 0,\nwhich are equivalent to\u222b\n]\u03b1,bo]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2264 0 \u2264\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,bo[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds). (111)\n24\nSimilarly, it might be optimal to wait before irreversibly switching the system to its closed\noperating mode, which is associated with a solution of the HJB equation (86) of the form\ngiven by\nw(0, x) = 0 and w(1, x) =\n{\n\u2212gc(x), if x \u2208 ]\u03b1, ac],\nA\u03c6(x) +Rh(x), if x \u2208 ]ac, \u03b2[,\n(112)\nfor some constant A and free-boundary point ac. Following the same reasoning as above, we\nexpect that the parameter A and the free-boundary point ac should satisfy\nA = \u2212\n(Rh + gc)(ac)\n\u03c6(ac)\n(113)\nand \u222b\n]ac,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2264 0 \u2264\n\u222b\n[ac,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds). (114)\nThe following result is concerned with conditions under which these strategies are indeed\nassociated with solutions of the HJB equation (86).\nLemma 5 In the presence of Assumptions 1\u20135, the following statements are true:\n(I) There exists a point bo satisfying (111) such that the function w defined by (108), where the\nconstant B \u2265 0 is given by (109), satisfies the HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3\nif and only if the problem data is such that any of the cases in Group WO of Table 1 occurs.\nIn particular,\n(a) if B1 holds true, then bo is any point in I,\n(b) if B3 holds true and bB3 > \u03b1, where bB3 is given by (78), then bo is any point in ]\u03b1, bB3],\nand\n(c) if B42 or B43 holds true, then bo = b\n\u2217.\n(II) There exists a point ac satisfying (114) such that the function w defined by (112), where the\nconstant A \u2265 0 is given by (113), satisfies the HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3\nif and only if the problem data is such that any of the cases in Group WC of Table 1 occurs.\nIn particular,\n(a) if A1 holds true, then ac is any point in I,\n(b) if A3 holds true and aA3 < \u03b2, where aA3 is given by (77), then ac is any point in [aA3, \u03b2[,\nand\n(c) if A42 or A43 holds true, then ac = a\n\u2217.\nFurthermore, if Assumption 6 also holds true, then each of the above statements is true if and\nonly if the problem data is such that one of the pairs in the corresponding groups of Table 2\noccurs. In particular, if one of the pairs in Group WO of Table 2 occurs, then B > 0 and\nbo = b\n\u2217, where b\u2217 is the point associated with (69)\u2013(71), while if one of the pairs in Group WC\nof Table 2 occurs, then A > 0 and ac = a\n\u2217, where a\u2217 is the point associated with (57)\u2013(59).\n25\nThe final possibility that arises is when it is optimal to sequentially switch the system from\nits open operating mode to its closed one, and vice versa. In this case, we postulate that the\nvalue function of our control problem identifies with a solution w to the HJB equation (86)\nthat has the form given by the expressions\nw(0, x) =\n{\nB\u03c8(x), if x \u2208 ]\u03b1, bo[,\nA\u03c6(x) +Rh(x)\u2212 go(x), if x \u2208 [bo, \u03b2[,\n(115)\nw(1, x) =\n{\nB\u03c8(x)\u2212 gc(x), if x \u2208 ]\u03b1, ac],\nA\u03c6(x) +Rh(x), if x \u2208 ]ac, \u03b2[,\n(116)\nfor some constants A, B and free-boundary points ac, bo such that \u03b1 < ac < bo < \u03b2. To\ndetermine these variables, we conjecture that the inequalities\nA\u03c6(ac) +Rh(ac) = B\u03c8(ac)\u2212 gc(ac), (117)\nA\u03c6\u2032(ac) + (Rh)\n\u2032\n\u2212(ac) \u2264 B\u03c8\n\u2032(ac)\u2212 (gc)\n\u2032\n\u2212(ac), (118)\nA\u03c6\u2032(ac) + (Rh)\n\u2032\n+(ac) \u2265 B\u03c8\n\u2032(ac)\u2212 (gc)\n\u2032\n+(ac) (119)\nshould hold at ac, and the inequalities\nB\u03c8(bo) = A\u03c6(bo) +Rh(bo)\u2212 go(bo), (120)\nB\u03c8\u2032(bo) \u2264 A\u03c6\n\u2032(bo) + (Rh)\n\u2032\n\u2212(bo)\u2212 (go)\n\u2032\n\u2212(bo), (121)\nB\u03c8\u2032(bo) \u2265 A\u03c6\n\u2032(bo) + (Rh)\n\u2032\n+(bo)\u2212 (go)\n\u2032\n+(bo) (122)\nshould hold at bo. An inspection of (117)\u2013(122) reveals that, when the functions Rh, gc and go\nare C1, these inequalities all hold as equalities. Indeed, in this case, (117)\u2013(122) reduce to the\nsystem of four equations that would be suggested by the so-called \u201cprinciple of smooth fit\u201d,\nwhich would require that the functions w(0, \u00b7) and w(1, \u00b7) should be C1 at the free boundary\npoints ac and bo, respectively.\nTo proceed further, we note that (117) and (120) are equivalent to\nA =\n(\nRh(bo)\u2212 go(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n\u2212\nRh(ac) + gc(ac)\n\u03c8(ac)\n)(\n\u03c6(ac)\n\u03c8(ac)\n\u2212\n\u03c6(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n)\u22121\n, (123)\nB =\n(\nRh(bo)\u2212 go(bo)\n\u03c6(bo)\n\u2212\nRh(ac) + gc(ac)\n\u03c6(ac)\n)(\n\u03c8(bo)\n\u03c6(bo)\n\u2212\n\u03c8(ac)\n\u03c6(ac)\n)\u22121\n. (124)\nFurthermore, in view of the identities (25)\u2013(28), we can see that (117)\u2013(119) imply the system\nof inequalities \u222b\n]ac,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2264 \u2212B \u2264\n\u222b\n[ac,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds), (125)\n\u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,ac]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) \u2264 \u2212A \u2264 \u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,ac[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds), (126)\n26\nwhile (120)\u2013(122) imply the system of inequalities\n\u2212\n\u222b\n]bo,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2264 B \u2264 \u2212\n\u222b\n[bo,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds), (127)\u222b\n]\u03b1,bo]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2264 A \u2264\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,bo[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds).

(134)\nFurthermore, it is straightforward to check that, in the presence of Assumption 7, if a solution\n(ac, bo) of the system of inequalities (129)\u2013(130) is such that ao < a\u02dc and b\u02dc < bc, then this\nsolution satisfies the system of equations\nq\u03c6(ac, bo) = 0 and q\u03c8(ac, bo) = 0, (135)\nwhere the functions q\u03c6 and q\u03c8 are given by\nq\u03c6(u, v) = \u2212\n\u222b \u03b2\nu\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b \u03b2\nv\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) (136)\nand\nq\u03c8(u, v) = \u2212\n\u222b u\n\u03b1\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b v\n\u03b1\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) (137)\nfor u \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ and v \u2208 ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[.\nThe following result is concerned with conditions under which there exist points ac < bo in\nI that satisfy (129)\u2013(130) and the corresponding function w defined by (115)\u2013(116) satisfies\nthe HJB equation (86).\n27\nLemma 6 In the presence of Assumptions 1\u20135, the following statements are true:\n(I) There exist points ac < bo in I satisfying the system of inequalities (129)\u2013(130) if the\nproblem data is such that any of the cases in Group S of Table 1 (or Table 2 if Assumption 6\nis also made) occurs.

In view of Lemmas 4, 5 and 6, the function w associated with each case satisfies\nthe HJB equation (86) in the sense of Definition 3. Also, it is straightforward to check\nthat, in all cases, w satisfies (92) and (93) in the verification Theorem 3. In view of these\nobservations, we only need to construct a switching strategy Z\u2217z,x = (S\n\u2217\nx, Z\n\u2217, T \u2217n) that possesses\nthe properties required by part (b) of Theorem 3. To this end, we fix any initial condition\n(z, x) \u2208 {0, 1} \u00d7 I and any weak solution S\u2217x = (\u2126,F ,Ft,Px, X,W ) of the SDE (1), and we\ndiscuss the construction of the switching process Z\u2217, the jumps of which occur at the times\ncomposing the sequence (T \u2217n), in what follows.\nIn Case (a), the sets Cc and Co defined by (90) and (91) in Definition 3 are given by\nCc = Co = I, and the switching process Z\n\u2217 \u2261 z, which is associated with T \u2217n = \u221e, for all\nn \u2265 1, is the required one because both of the sets in (94) are empty and the inclusions in\n(95)\u2013(96) are trivially true.\nIn Case (b), Cc = \u2205 and Co = I, and the switching process Z\n\u2217 given by\nZ\u2217t = z1{0}(t) + 1]0,\u221e[(t)\nis optimal because the sets in (94) contain at most one element, while (95)\u2013(96) plainly hold.\nIn Case (d), I \\ Cc = [bo, \u03b2[, I \\ Co = \u2205, and the switching process Z\n\u2217 given by\nZ\u2217t = z1[0,T \u22171 ](t) + 1]T \u22171 ,\u221e[(t),\nwhere T \u22171 = inf{t \u2265 0 | Xt \u2265 bo}, has all of the required properties.\nThe constructions that are appropriate for Cases (c) and (e) are mirror images of the\nconstructions associated with Cases (b) and (d) above, respectively.\nIn Case (f), I \\ Cc = [bo, \u03b2[ and I \\ Co = ]\u03b1, ac]. If z = 1, then the switching process Z\n\u2217\ngiven by\nZ\u2217t = 1{0}(t) +\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\n1]T \u2217\n2j+1,T\n\u2217\n2j ]\n(t),\nwhere the (Ft)-stopping times T\n\u2217\nn , n \u2265 1 are defined recursively by\nT \u22172n+1 = inf{t \u2265 T\n\u2217\n2n | Xt \u2264 ac}, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\nT \u22172n = inf{t \u2265 T\n\u2217\n2n\u22121 | Xt \u2265 bo}, n = 1, 2, . . . ,\nwhere we have set T \u22170 = 0, provides an optimal choice because the sets in (94) both are\ncountable, while the inclusions in (95)\u2013(96) both hold. Note that Z\u2217 is indeed a finite variation\nprocess because T \u2217n \u2192\u221e, Px-a.s.. To see this claim, we use the definition (3) of the discounting\nfactor \u039b, the strong Markov property of the process X and (10) to obtain\nEx\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2n+1\n]\n= Ex\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2nEx\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b T \u2217\n2n+1\u2212T\n\u2217\n2n\n0\nr(Xs+T \u2217\n2n\n) ds\n)\n| FT \u2217\n2n\n]]\n= Ex\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2nEbo\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03c4ac\n0\nr(Xs) ds\n)]]\n=\n\u03c6(bo)\n\u03c6(ac)\nEx\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2n\n]\n.\n29\nSimilarly, we can see that\nEx\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2n\n]\n=\n\u03c8(ac)\n\u03c8(bo)\nEx\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2n\u22121\n]\n.\nThese calculations and the dominated convergence theorem imply that\nEx\n[\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n2n+1\n]\n= lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nEx\n[\ne\n\u2212\u039bT\u2217\n1\n](\u03c6(bo)\u03c8(ac)\n\u03c6(ac)\u03c8(bo)\n)n\n= 0,\nthe second equality following from the facts that \u03c6 (resp., \u03c8) is strictly decreasing (resp., in-\ncreasing) and ac < bo. This conclusion contradicts the possibility that Px (limn\u2192\u221e T\n\u2217\nn <\u221e) >\n0.\nFinally, in Case (f), if z = 0, then the optimal switching process Z\u2217 can be constructed in\na similar fashion. \u0003\n7 Examples\n7.1 The model studied by Duckworth and Zervos [DZ01]\nSuppose that I = ]0,\u221e[, that X is the geometric Brownian motion given by\ndXt = bXt dt+ \u03c3Xt dWt,\nfor some constants b, \u03c3, and that the discounting rate r is a constant. In this case,\n\u03c6(x) = xm and \u03c8(x) = xn,\nwhere the constants m < 0 < n are given by\nm,n =\n\u2212\n(\n\u00b5\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)\n\u00b1\n\u221a(\n\u00b5\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)2\n+ 2\u03c32r\n\u03c32\n,\nand both of \u03b1 \u2261 0 and \u03b2 \u2261 \u221e are natural boundary points. Assume that the measure h \u2208 I\u03c6,\u03c8\nis absolutely continuous with Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure\ndenoted by h\u02d9, where h\u02d9 is an increasing function such that limx\u2192\u221e h\u02d9(x) = \u221e. Also, suppose\nthat go(x) = Ko and gc(x) = Kc, for some constants Ko, Kc with Ko + Kc > 0. In this\ncontext, Assumptions 1\u20134 and (39)\u2013(40) in Assumption 5 are all satisfied. Also, the measures\nL(Rh + gc) and L(Rh \u2212 go) are absolutely continuous,\nL(Rh + gc)(dx) =\n(\n\u2212h\u02d9(x)\u2212 rKc\n)\ndx and L(Rh \u2212 go)(dx) =\n(\n\u2212h\u02d9(x) + rKo\n)\ndx.\nIn view of the inequality \u2212h\u02d9(x) \u2212 rKc < \u2212h\u02d9(x) + rKo and the fact that limx\u2192\u221e h\u02d9(x) = \u221e,\nwe can check that we can have only one of the following three cases (see also Theorem 5 in\nDuckworth and Zervos [DZ01]).\n30\nDZ1 If 0 \u2264 infx>0 h\u02d9(x) \u2212 rKo, then cases A2 and B3 in Assumption 5 occur, and we are in\nthe context of Group O in Tables 1 and 2.\nDZ2 If infx>0 h\u02d9(x) \u2212 rKo < 0 \u2264 infx>0 h\u02d9(x) + rKc, then cases A2 and B4 in Assumption 5\noccur, with\nb\u02dc = sup\n{\nx > 0 | h\u02d9(x)\u2212 rKo \u2264 0\n}\n> 0. (140)\nIn particular, case B43 occurs, which puts us in the context of Group WO in Tables 1\nand 2. The claim that case B43 rather than either of the cases B41 or B43 occurs\nfollows from (30) and a simple inspection of (66) and (68).\nDZ3 If infx>0 h\u02d9(x) + rKc < 0, then the requirements of cases A4 and B4 in Assumption 5\nare satisfied, with\na\u02dc = inf\n{\nx > 0 | h\u02d9(x) + rKc \u2265 0\n}\n> 0,\nand with b\u02dc > a\u02dc being given by (140). In view of (30), we can see that cases A43 and\nB43 occur, which puts us in the context of Group S of Tables 1 and 2. Also, it is worth\nnoting that both of Assumptions 6 and 7 are satisfied, so the uniqueness claims made\nby part (II) of Lemma 6 hold true.\n7.2 Square-root mean reverting process\nSuppose that I = ]0,\u221e[, and that X is the square-root mean-reverting process given by\ndXt = (2\u2212Xt) dt+\n\u221a\n2Xt dWt.\nThis SDE is a special case of the one modelling the short rate in the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest\nrate model, and X satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. Also, let\nr(x) = 2, for all x > 0,\nwhich is a choice compatible with Assumption 3. The associated ODE (2.3) takes the form of\nxf \u2032\u2032(x) + (2\u2212 x)f \u2032(x)\u2212 2f(x) = 0,\nwhich is a special case of Kumer\u2019s equation. The functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 that span the solution\nspace of this equation and satisfy (6)-(8) are given by\n\u03c6(x) = U(2, 2; x) and \u03c8(x) = 1F1(2, 2; x) \u2261 e\nx,\nwhere U and 1F1 are confluent hypergeometric functions (see Abramowitz and Stegun [AS72,\nChapter 13]). In view of the computation\nEx\n[\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u22122tXt dt\n]\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u22122tEx [Xt] dt =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u22122t\n[\n2 + (x\u2212 2)e\u2212t\n]\ndt =\nx+ 1\n3\n,\n31\nand (18), we can see that, if we choose the measure h to be absolutely continuous with Radon-\nNikodym derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure (dh\/dx)(x) = x, then\nRh(x) =\nx+ 1\n3\nand LRh(dx) = \u2212x dx,\nwhile, if we choose\ngc(x) =\n2x+ \u03b4\n3\nand go =\n\u2212(e\u2212 1)x+ 1\n3\n,\nwhere e = 2.73 . . . is the base of the natural logarithms, then\nLgc(dx) =\n\u22126x+ 2(2\u2212 \u03b4)\n3\ndx and Lgo(dx) =\n3(e\u2212 1)x\u2212 2e\n3\ndx.\nWe can also verify that these choices satisfy all of of the requirements of Assumption 4,\nproviding that \u03b4 > \u22121. Furthermore, noting that\nL(Rh + gc)(dx) =\n\u22129x+ 2(2\u2212 \u03b4)\n3\ndx and L(Rh \u2212 go)(dx) =\n\u22123ex+ 2e\n3\ndx,\nwe can see that cases A4 and B4 of Assumption 5 occur with\n0 < a\u02dc =\n2(2\u2212 \u03b4)\n9\n\u2264\n2\n3\n= b\u02dc,\nas long as \u03b4 \u2208 [\u22121, 2[. In view of the consideration above, we can see that the choices of the\nproblem data that we have made satisfy Assumptions 1\u20137, provided that\n\u03b4 \u2208 ]\u2212 1, 2[.\nAlso, we can calculate\nlim\nx\u21930\n(Rh + gc)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n=\n1 + \u03b4\n3\nand\n(Rh \u2212 go)(b\n\u2217)\n\u03c8(b\u2217)\n=\n1\n3\n,\nwhere b\u2217 = 1 is the point appearing in (69)\u2013(71) of case B43 discussed in Section 4.

By construction, the function w given by (105) satisfies the HJB\nequation (86) if and only if\nw(1, \u00b7)\u2212 w(0, \u00b7)\u2212 go \u2264 0 and w(0, \u00b7)\u2212 w(1, \u00b7)\u2212 gc \u2264 0,\nwhich is equivalent to\nRh \u2212 go \u2264 0 and \u2212 Rh \u2212 gc \u2264 0.\nHowever, a simple inspection of the lists in Section 4 reveals that these inequalities hold true\nif and only if the problem data is as in the corresponding statement of the lemma.\nTo establish part (II) of the lemma, we note that the function w defined by (106) satisfies\n(86) if and only if\n\u2212L(Rh \u2212 go) is a positive measure (141)\nand\nw(0, \u00b7)\u2212 w(1, \u00b7)\u2212 gc \u2264 0. (142)\nInequality (142) is plainly equivalent to \u2212go \u2212 gc \u2264 0, which is true by assumption. On the\nother hand, inequality (141) holds if and only in the problem data is such that B1 or B3\nis satisfied, which gives rise to the cases in Group O of Table 1, or the cases in Group O of\nTable 2 if Assumption 6 is also made.\nFinally, we can use symmetric arguments to prove all claims associated with part (III) of\nthe lemma. \u0003\nProof of Lemma 5. To prove part (I) of the lemma, we first observe that, if there exists a\npoint bo satisfying (111), then the associated function w defined by (108) will satisfy the HJB\nequation (86) if and only if\nsupp\n[\nLw(0, \u00b7)\n]+\n\u2229 [bo, \u03b2[ = \u2205, (143)\nw(0, x)\u2212 w(1, x)\u2212 gc(x) \u2264 0, for all x \u2208 I, (144)\nw(1, x)\u2212 w(0, x)\u2212 go(x) \u2264 0, for all x \u2208 ]\u03b1, bo[. (145)\nIn view of the inequality\nLw(0, \u00b7)({bo}) =\n1\n2\n\u03c32(bo)\n[\n(Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n+(bo)\u2212 B\u03c8\n\u2032(bo)\n]\n\u2264 0,\nwhich follows from (109) and (110), we can see that (143) holds true if and only if\nthe restriction of L(Rh \u2212 go) in\n(\n]bo, \u03b2[,B(]bo, \u03b2[)\n)\nis a positive measure. (146)\n33\nAn inspection of the conditions in Assumption 5 and the various associated cases appearing\nin Section 4 reveals that there exists a point bo \u2208 I that satisfies (111) and is such that (146)\nholds true if and only if we are in the context of one of the cases (I.a), (I.b) or (I.c) in the\nstatement of the lemma.\nNow, for x \u2265 bo, (144) is equivalent to \u2212(gc+go)(x) \u2264 0, which is true by Assumption (33).\nFurthermore, we can use the definition (108) of w and the expression for B provided by (109)\nto verify that (144), for x < bo, and (145) are equivalent to\n(Rh + gc)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2265\n(Rh \u2212 go)(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n\u2265\n(Rh \u2212 go)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n, for all x \u2208 ]\u03b1, bo[. (147)\nThe second of these inequalities holds with equality in cases (I.a) and (I.b) in the statement\nof this lemma, thanks to (47). In case (I.c), it follows immediately from the fact that the\nfunction (Rh \u2212 go)\/\u03c8 is increasing in ]\u03b1, b\n\u2217[ (see (68) and (70)).\nTo complete the proof of part (I) of the lemma, we need to establish conditions under\nwhich the first inequality in (147) holds true in the context of one of the cases (I.a), (I.b) or\n(I.c) in the statement of this lemma. To this end, we use (27) to calculate(\nRh + gc\n\u03c8\n)\u2032\n+\n(x) =\nW(x)\n\u03c82(x)\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds).\nWhen the problem data is such that case A2 in Assumption 5 holds, this calculation implies\nthat the function (Rh+gc)\/\u03c8 is decreasing in I. Combining this observation with the inequality\n(Rh + gc)(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n>\n(Rh \u2212 go)(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n, (148)\nwhich follows from (33) in Assumption 4, we can see that the first of the two inequalities\nin (147) is satisfied. On the other hand, when the problem data is such that case A4 in\nAssumption 5 holds, this calculation implies that there exists a point \u03b3 \u2208 ]a\u02dc, \u03b2[ such that the\nfunction (Rh+ gc)\/\u03c8 is increasing in ]\u03b1, \u03b3[ and decreasing in ]\u03b3, \u03b2[. However, this observation\nand inequality (148) imply that the first of the inequalities in (147) is satisfied if and only if\nlim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n(Rh + gc)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2265\n(Rh \u2212 go)(bo)\n\u03c8(bo)\n.\nIn cases B42 and B43, in which bo = b\n\u2217, this inequality holds true if and only if the inequality\nin (73) is not true. Combining all these consideration with the fact that we are in the context\nof one of the cases (I.a), (I.b) or (I.c) in the statement of the lemma, (75), and the restrictions\non the possible pairings given by (76), we can see that the first inequality in (147) holds true\nif and only if the problem data is such that one of the cases in Group WO of Table 1 occurs.\nFinally, the proof of part (II) of the lemma follows arguments that are symmetric to the\nones we have developed above to establish part (I). \u0003\nProof of Lemma 6. We start by assuming that the problem data is such that A4 and B4\nin Assumption 5 are satisfied. Given any v \u2208 I, we can see that\nqO\u03c6 (u2, v)\u2212 q\nO\n\u03c6 (u1, v) =\n\u222b\n]u1,u2]\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds)\n{\n\u2265 0, if u1 < u2 < a\u02dc,\n\u2264 0, if a\u02dc < u1 < u2,\n34\nthe inequalities following because of (36) in Assumption 5. In view of this calculation and a\nsimilar one with qC\u03c6, we can see that, given any v \u2208 I,\nthe functions u 7\u2192 qO\u03c6 (u, v) and u 7\u2192 q\nC\n\u03c6(u, v) are\n{\nincreasing in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[,\ndecreasing in ]a\u02dc, \u03b2[,\n(149)\nIn the same way, we can see that, given any u \u2208 I,\nthe functions v 7\u2192 qO\u03c6 (u, v) and v 7\u2192 q\nC\n\u03c6(u, v) are\n{\ndecreasing in ]\u03b1, b\u02dc[,\nincreasing in ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[.\n(150)\ngiven any v \u2208 I,\nthe functions u 7\u2192 qO\u03c8 (u, v) and u 7\u2192 q\nC\n\u03c8(u, v) are\n{\ndecreasing in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[,\nincreasing in ]a\u02dc, \u03b2[,\n(151)\nand, given any u \u2208 I,\nthe functions v 7\u2192 qO\u03c8 (u, v) and v 7\u2192 q\nC\n\u03c8(u, v) are\n{\nincreasing in ]\u03b1, b\u02dc[,\ndecreasing in ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[.\n(152)\nWe can also see that (36) and (37) in Assumption 5 imply that\nqC\u03c8(u, v)\u2212 q\nO\n\u03c8 (u, v) = \u2212\u03a8(u)L(Rh + gc)({u}) + \u03a8(v)L(Rh \u2212 go)({v})\n\u2264 0, for all u < a\u02dc \u2264 b\u02dc < v, (153)\nand that\nqC\u03c6(u, v)\u2212 q\nO\n\u03c6 (u, v) \u2264 0, for all u < a\u02dc \u2264 b\u02dc < v. (154)\nNoting that each of the cases in Group S of Table 1 or Table 2 combines either B43 with\none ofA41, A42 orA43, orA43 with one of B41, B42 or B43, we prove all claims regarding\nthe solvability of the system of inequalities (129)\u2013(130) when case B43 prevails; the proofs of\nthe corresponding claims when A43 prevails follow symmetric arguments. In the context of\ncase B43, we start by observing that (81) implies that\nlim\nu\u2193\u03b1\nqC\u03c8(u, b\n\u2217) \u2264 0 \u2264 lim\nu\u2193\u03b1\nqO\u03c8 (u, b\n\u2217), (155)\nthe first of which inequalities and (151) imply that\nqC\u03c8(u, b\n\u2217) \u2264 0, for all u \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[. (156)\nAlso, (37) and (39) in Assumption 5 imply that\nqC\u03c8(u, b\u02dc) = \u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,u]\n\u03a8(s)L(gc + go)(ds) +\n\u222b\n]u,b\u02dc]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n> 0, for all u \u2264 a\u02dc. (157)\n35\nNow, (156), (157), (152) and the right-continuity of v 7\u2192 qC\u03c8(u, v) imply that, given any\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, there exists a point l(u) \u2208 ]\u02dcb, b\u2217] such that\nqC\u03c8(u, v)\n{\n> 0, for all v \u2208 [\u02dcb, l(u)[,\n\u2264 0, for all v \u2208 [l(u), b\u2217].\n(158)\nOn the other hand, (153), (158) and the left-continuity of v 7\u2192 qO\u03c8 (u, v) imply that, given any\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, there exists a point l(u) \u2208 [l(u), b\u2217] such that\nqO\u03c8 (u, v)\n{\n\u2265 0, for all v \u2208 [\u02dcb, l(u)],\n< 0, for all v \u2208 ]l(u), b\u2217].\n(159)\nWe now verify that the function l is decreasing and left-continuous. Given u1 < u2 < a\u02dc,\nwe can use (159) and (36) in Assumption 5 to observe that\nqO\u03c8 (u1, l(u2)) = q\nO\n\u03c8 (u2, l(u2)) +\n\u222b\n[u1,u2[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds)\n\u2265 0. (160)\nIn view of (159), this inequality implies that l(u2) \u2264 l(u1), which proves that l is decreasing.\nTo establish the left-continuity of l, we fix any u\u02c6 \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[. If there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that\nl(u) = l(u\u02c6), for all u \u2208 ]u\u02c6\u2212 \u03b5, u\u02c6], then l is plainly left-continuous at u\u02c6. In view of the fact that\nl is decreasing, we can therefore assume that l(u) > l(u\u02c6), for all u < u\u02c6, and use (159) to obtain\n0 \u2264 lim\nu\u2191u\u02c6\nqO\u03c8 (u, l(u))\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,u\u02c6[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,limu\u2191u\u02c6 l(u)]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= lim\nv\u2193limu\u2191u\u02c6 l(u)\nqO\u03c8 (u\u02c6, v). (161)\nThe positivity of the last limit in these calculations and (159) imply that limu\u2191u\u02c6 l(u) \u2264 l(u\u02c6). On\nthe other hand, the fact that l is decreasing implies that limu\u2191u\u02c6 l(u) \u2265 l(u\u02c6). These inequalities\nimply that limu\u2191u\u02c6 l(u) = l(u\u02c6), and the left-continuity of l follows.\nWe will also need the inequality\n\u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6}) +\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2265 0 (162)\nto be true for all u\u02c6 \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ such that l(u) < l(u\u02c6) for all u > u\u02c6. To prove this result, we fix any\nsuch u\u02c6 \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, and we use (158) and the fact that the function l \u2265 l is decreasing to obtain\n0 \u2264 \u2212 lim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\nqC\u03c8(u, l(u))\n=\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,u\u02c6]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds)\u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u)[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds).\n36\nAlso, we note that (159) yields\n0 \u2264 \u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,u\u02c6[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds).\nAdding these inequalities side by side, we obtain\n\u03a8(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6}) +\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2265 0.\nIn view of the identity \u03a8 = \u03c8\u03a6\/\u03c6, which follows from (13), and the fact that the function\n\u03c8\/\u03c6 is increasing, it follows that\n0 \u2264\n\u03c8(u\u02c6)\n\u03c6(u\u02c6)\n\u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6}) +\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03c8(s)\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n\u2264\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n\u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6}) +\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds),\nwhich establishes (162).\nA simple inspection of (158) and (159) reveals that, given any u \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, qC\u03c8(u, v) \u2264 0 \u2264\nqO\u03c8 (u, v), for all v \u2208 [l(u), l(u)]. In particular, if we set l(u) = l(u), then we obtain a function\nl such that\nl(u) \u2208 ]\u02dcb, b\u2217] and qC\u03c8(u, l(u)) \u2264 0 \u2264 q\nO\n\u03c8 (u, l(u)), for all u \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[. (163)\nAlso, we note that\nl \u2261 l is left-continuous and decreasing, and lim\nu\u2193\u03b1\nl(u) = b\u2217. (164)\nThe limit here is a simple consequence of the left-continuity of l \u2261 l, (159) and (155).\nIn general, the function l can have jumps as well as intervals of constancy. However,\nif Assumptions 6 and 7 also hold, then l is continuous and strictly decreasing. (165)\nTo see this claim, we note that, in the presence of Assumptions 6 and 7, qO\u03c8 \u2261 q\nC\n\u03c8 \u2261 q\u03c8,\nwhere q\u03c8 is given by (137), and the function u 7\u2192 q\u03c8(u, v) is continuous and strictly decreasing\nin ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, while the function v 7\u2192 q\u03c8(u, v) is continuous and strictly decreasing in ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[. In\nview of this observation and the arguments leading to (158)\u2013(159), we can see that, given any\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, there exists a unique point l(u) \u2208 ]\u02dcb, b\u2217[ such that\nq\u03c8(u, v)\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n> 0, if v \u2208 [\u02dcb, l(u)[,\n= 0, if v = l(u),\n< 0, if v \u2208 ]l(u), b\u2217].\n(166)\n37\nThe resulting function l satisfies (160) with strict inequality, which implies that l is strictly de-\ncreasing. We can also use (166) and a straightforward adaptation of the arguments associated\nwith (161) to verify that l is continuous.\nTo proceed further, we consider the functions u 7\u2192 qO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) and u 7\u2192 q\nC\n\u03c6(u, l(u)). Given\nu\u02c6 \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, we use the fact that l is decreasing to calculate\nlim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) = \u2212\n\u222b\n]u\u02c6,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) + lim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\n\u222b\n]l(u),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= qO\u03c6 (u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)) + lim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\n\u222b\n]l(u),l(u\u02c6)]\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n\u2264 qO\u03c6 (u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (167)\nwhere the inequality follows from (37) in Assumption 5. Also, we can use the left-continuity\nof l (see (164)) to calculate\nlim\nu\u2191u\u02c6\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) = \u2212\n\u222b\n[u\u02c6,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n]l(u\u02c6),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= qO\u03c6 (u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6))\u2212 \u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6})\n\u2264 qO\u03c6 (u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (168)\nwhere the inequality follows from (36) in Assumption 5. If there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that\nl(u) = l(u\u02c6), for all u \u2208 ]u\u02c6\u2212 \u03b5, u\u02c6], then\nlim\nu\u2191u\u02c6\nqC\u03c6(u, l(u)) = q\nC\n\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (169)\nwhile, if l(u) > l(u\u02c6), for all u < u\u02c6, then we can use the left-continuity of l to calculate\nlim\nu\u2191u\u02c6\nqC\u03c6(u, l(u)) = \u2212\n\u222b\n[u\u02c6,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n]l(u\u02c6),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6))\u2212 \u03a6(l(u\u02c6))L(Rh \u2212 go)({l(u\u02c6)})\n\u2265 qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (170)\nwhere the inequality follows from (37) in Assumption 5. Similarly, if there exists \u03b5 > 0 such\nthat l(u) = l(u\u02c6), for all u \u2208 [u\u02c6, u\u02c6+ \u03b5[, then\nlim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\nqC\u03c6(u, l(u))\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n]u\u02c6,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n[l(u\u02c6),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)) + \u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6})\n\u2265 qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (171)\n38\nwhere the inequality follows from (36) in Assumption 5, while, if l(u) < l(u\u02c6), for all u > u\u02c6,\nthen\nlim\nu\u2193u\u02c6\nqC\u03c6(u, l(u))\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n]u\u02c6,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)) + \u03a6(u\u02c6)L(Rh + gc)({u\u02c6}) +\n\u222b\n[limu\u2193u\u02c6 l(u),l(u\u02c6)[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n\u2265 qC\u03c6(u\u02c6, l(u\u02c6)), (172)\nwhere the inequality follows from the fact that the function l \u2261 l satisfies (162).\nThe calculations in (167)\u2013(168) imply that the function u 7\u2192 qO\u03c8 (u, l(u)) is upper semicon-\ntinuous, while the calculations in (169)\u2013(172) imply that the function u 7\u2192 qC\u03c8(u, l(u)) is lower\nsemicontinuous. It follows that the sets\nEo =\n{\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ | qO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) \u2265 0\n}\nand Ec =\n{\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ | qC\u03c6(u, l(u)) \u2264 0\n}\nare closed in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ if we endow this interval with the trace of the usual topology on R. Also,\nthe inequality (154) implies that ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ \\Eo \u2286 Ec. This inclusion and the definitions of the sets\nEo, Ec imply that, if\ninf Eo > \u03b1 and Eo 6= \u2205, (173)\nthen min Eo \u2208 Ec, and the points ao, bc defined by\nac = min Eo \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ and bo = l(ao) \u2208 ]\u02dcb, b\n\u2217]\nsatisfy the system of inequalities (129)\u2013(130). To see that the claim min Eo \u2208 Ec is indeed\ntrue, we consider any sequence (xn) in ]\u03b1,min Eo[ such that limn\u2192\u221e xn = min Eo. Since\n]\u03b1, a\u02dc[ \\Eo \u2286 Ec, xn \u2208 Ec, for all n. It follows that limn\u2192\u221e xn \u2208 Ec because Ec is closed.\nIn view of the definition of the set Eo, (173) will follow if we prove that\nlim\nu\u2193\u03b1\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) < 0 and lim\nu\u2191a\u02dc\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) > 0. (174)\nThe second of these inequalities follows immediately from the observation that\nlim\nu\u2191a\u02dc\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) = \u2212\n\u222b\n[a\u02dc,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) + lim\nu\u2191a\u02dc\n\u222b\n]l(u),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n= lim\nu\u2191a\u02dc\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b\n[a\u02dc,l(u)]\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds)\u2212\n\u222b\n]l(u),\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(gc + go)(ds)\n)\n, (175)\nthe fact that limu\u2191a\u02dc l(u) \u2264 b\n\u2217 < \u03b2, and (36), (40) in Assumption 5.\nTo establish the first inequality in (174), we have to distinguish between two cases. If the\nproblem data is such that case A42 or case A43 is satisfied, then we can use (82), (55) or\n39\n(57), according to the case, and (71) to calculate\nlim\nv\u2191b\u2217\nqO\u03c6 (u, v) = \u2212\n\u222b\n]u,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n[b\u2217,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n\u2264 \u2212\n\u222b\n]u,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds)\u2212\n(Rh \u2212 go)(b\n\u2217)\n\u03c8(b\u2217)\n< 0, for all u \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u2217[.\nCombining this inequality with the fact that the function v 7\u2192 qO\u03c6 (u, v) is increasing in ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[\n(see (150)) and the fact that l : ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[\u2192 ]\u02dcb, b\u2217], we can see that that qO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) < 0, for all\nu \u2208 ]\u03b1, a\u2217[, which establishes the first inequality in (174) as well as the claim that ac \u2265 a\n\u2217 in\n(138). On the other hand, if the problem data is such that case A41 prevails, then we can\nuse (82), (83) and the fact that limu\u2193\u03b1 l(u) = b\n\u2217 to calculate\nlim\nu\u2193\u03b1\nqO\u03c6 (u, l(u)) = \u2212\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b\n[b\u2217,\u03b2[\n\u03a6(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n\u2264 lim\nx\u2193\u03b1\n(Rh + gc)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2212\n(Rh \u2212 go)(b\n\u2217)\n\u03c8(b\u2217)\n,\nwhich proves that, if the problem data is such that the pair A41\u2013B43 occurs, then the first\nof the inequalities in (174) is satisfied if (73) is true.\nThe analysis up to this point has established all of the claims made in part (I) of the\nlemma. In view of this analysis and the fact that, in the presence of Assumptions 6 and 7,\nqO\u03c6 \u2261 q\nC\n\u03c6 = q\u03c6, where q\u03c6 is given by (136), part (II) of the lemma will follow immediately from\n(174) if we prove that the function u 7\u2192 q\u03c6(u, l(u)) is strictly increasing in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[. To this end,\nwe fix any points u1 < u2 in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[. Using (13), (136), (165) and (166), we calculate[\nq\u03c6(u2, l(u2))\u2212 q\u03c6(u1, l(u1))\n]\n\/\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n=\n\u222b u2\nu1\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh + gc)(ds) +\n\u222b l(u2)\nl(u1)\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\nand\n0 =\n[\nq\u03c8(u2, l(u2))\u2212 q\u03c8(u1, l(u1))\n]\n\/\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n= \u2212\n\u222b u2\nu1\n\u03c8(s)\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh + gc)(ds)\u2212\n\u222b l(u2)\nl(u1)\n\u03c8(s)\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh \u2212 go)(ds).\nThese calculations, fact that the strictly positive function \u03c6 (resp., \u03c8) is decreasing (resp.,\n40\nincreasing), (36)\u2013(37) in Assumption 5 and Assumption 6 imply that[\nq\u03c6(u2, l(u2))\u2212 q\u03c6(u1, l(u1))\n]\n\/\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n=\n\u222b u2\nu1\n[\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n\u2212\n\u03c8(s)\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n]\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh + gc)(ds)\n+\n\u222b l(u2)\nl(u1)\n[\n\u03c6(s)\n\u03c6(a\u02dc)\n\u2212\n\u03c8(s)\n\u03c8(a\u02dc)\n]\n1\n\u03c32(s)W(s)\nL(Rh \u2212 go)(ds).\n> 0,\nwhich proves that the function u 7\u2192 q\u03c6(u, l(u)) is strictly increasing in ]\u03b1, a\u02dc[, and part (II) of\nthe lemma follows.\nIt remains to prove part (III) of the lemma.

(179)\nTo prove (176) and (177), we first observe that, since Rh satisfies the ODE LRh + h = 0,\nwhere the operator L is defined by (12),\n1\n2\n\u03c32(x)\n[\n(Rh)\n\u2032\n+(x)\u2212 (Rh)\n\u2032\n\u2212(x)\n]\n+ h({x}) = 0, for all x \u2208 I.\nIn view of this identity and the definition (116) of w(1, \u00b7), we can see that\n[Lw(1, \u00b7) + h] ({ac}) =\n1\n2\n\u03c32(ac)\n[\n(A\u03c6+Rh)\n\u2032\n+(ac)\u2212 (B\u03c8 \u2212 gc)\n\u2032\n\u2212(ac)\n]\n+ h({ac})\n=\n1\n2\n\u03c32(ac)\n[\nA\u03c6\u2032(ac) + (Rh)\n\u2032\n\u2212(ac)\u2212 B\u03c8\n\u2032(ac) + (gc)\n\u2032\n\u2212(ac)\n]\n\u2264 0, (180)\nwhere the inequality follows from (118). Also, we can use the definition (115) of w(0, \u00b7) and\n(122) to calculate\nLw(0, \u00b7)({bo}) =\n1\n2\n\u03c32(bo)\n[\n(A\u03c6+Rh \u2212 go)\n\u2032\n+(bo)\u2212 B\u03c8\n\u2032(bo)\n]\n\u2264 0. (181)\n41\nCombining (180) with the fact that the restrictions of the measures Lw(1, \u00b7)+h and L(Rh+gc)\non\n(\n]\u03b1, ac[,B(]\u03b1, ac[)\n)\nare equal, we can see that (176) follows from (36) in Assumption 5 and\nthe fact that ac < a\u02dc. Similarly, (181), the fact that the restrictions of the measures Lw(0, \u00b7)\nand L(Rh \u2212 go) on\n(\n]bo, \u03b2[,B(]bo, \u03b2[)\n)\nare equal, (37) in Assumption 5 and the fact that\nb\u02dc < bo imply (177). Also, it is straightforward to see that (178) (resp., (179)) is equivalent\nto gc(x) + go(x) \u2265 0 when x \u2264 ac (resp., when bo \u2264 x), which is true thanks to (33) in\nAssumption 4.\nTo prove (178) for x \u2208 ]ac, bo], we have to show that\n\u03be(x) := A\n\u03c6(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2212 B +\n(Rh \u2212 go)(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2264 0, for all x \u2208 [ac, bo]. (182)\nTo this end, we use (47) and (9) to calculate\n\u03be\u2032+(x) =\nW(x)\n\u03c82(x)\n[\n\u2212A +\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds)\n]\n. (183)\nIn view of the second inequality in (128), we can see that\n\u2212A +\n\u222b\n]\u03b1,x]\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds) \u2265 \u2212\n\u222b\n]x,bo[\n\u03a8(s)L(Rh \u2212 go)(ds),\nwhich, combined with (37) in Assumption 5 and the strict positivity of the functionW, implies\nthat\n\u03be\u2032+(x) \u2265 0, for all x \u2208 [\u02dcb, bo[. (184)\nAlso, we can see that (37) in Assumption 5 and (183) imply that the function \u03c82\u03be\u2032+\/W is\nincreasing in ]\u03b1, b\u02dc] and decreasing in ]\u02dcb, \u03b2[. It follows that either \u03be\u2032+(x) \u2265 0, for all x \u2208 [ac, bo[,\nor there exists a point \u03b3 \u2208 ]ac, b\u02dc] such that \u03be\n\u2032\n+(x) < 0, for all x \u2208 [ac, \u03b3[, and \u03be\n\u2032\n+(x) \u2265 0, for all\nx \u2208 [\u03b3, bo[. Combining either of these two cases with the calculations\n\u03be(ac) = \u2212\ngc(ac) + go(ac)\n\u03c8(ac)\n< 0 and \u03be(bo) = 0,\nwhich follow from the construction of w, we can see that the inequality (182) holds true.\nFinally, the proof of (179) for x \u2208 [ac, bo[ follows similar symmetric arguments. \u0003\nReferences\n[AS72] M.Abramowitz and I.
