Of these over\n40,000 are dead within one year of admission [2]. Over\nthe five years after an intensive care unit (ICU) admission\nthese patients also have an excess risk of death when com-\npared to an age and sex matched population [3]. Apart\nfrom this excess mortality, it is now becoming clear that\nintensive care patients continue to experience both physi-\ncal (e.g. neuropathy, reduced mobility, and breathless-\nness) [4,5], and psychological problems (e.g. anxiety,\ndepression and posttraumatic stress) [6-9] for some time\nafter discharge from ICU. Approximately two thirds of\nICU survivors will experience significant problems with\nphysical and psychological health and social functioning,\nand with 13% of patients experiencing severe limitations\nin every day life [10,11]. Studies assessing Health-Related\nQuality of Life (HRQoL) after intensive care suggest that\nthis improves over time [12,13], but is worse than before\nadmission to ICU [14,15], and worse than general popu-\nlation norms [13,16,17]. Reported prevalence of anxiety\nand depressive problems in this patient group ranges from\n12% to 43% (for anxiety) [9,16], and 10% to 30% (for\ndepression) [9,16]. Reports also suggest that 14% to 27%\nof intensive care patients may develop a posttraumatic\nstress reaction [6,9] that may endure for a number of years\n[7]. Patients' perceptions of the intensive care experience\nitself are associated with subsequent distress, and patients'\nsubjective reports frequently include the presence of 'odd\nperceptual experiences' [18], or 'nightmares' and 'halluci-\nnations' [19] which seem real and distressing for them at\nthe time. The reported frequency of these experiences\nranges from 7% to 73% [20,21]. These continuing prob-\nlems have implications not just for patients, but impose a\ncontinuing financial burden for the National Health Serv-\nice (NHS) in terms of primary and secondary health care\ncosts.\nEighty hospitals across the UK have now developed Inten-\nsive Care follow-up clinics in an attempt to improve out-\ncomes after ICU discharge [22]. This is despite a lack of an\nevidence base for this intervention, although the Outreach\nForum of the Department of Health has issued guidelines\nfor the delivery of ICU follow-up services based on expert\nopinion [11]. Despite these guidelines, it is clear that the\nnature of these clinics varies between centres [22]. The\nclinics aim to support recovery, are often multi-discipli-\nnary in nature and offer patients the opportunity to dis-\ncuss issues related to their intensive care experience over\ntwo or three appointments in the year after ICU discharge\n[22]. One of the other purported benefits of these clinics\nis that ICU practitioners gain valuable information about\npsychological and physical problems faced by patients\nthat can then be used to inform the management of future\npatients [4,5]. The NHS is spending a large amount of\nclinical resource on these clinics and this is likely to con-\ntinue. Because there are only 80 ICU follow-up clinics in\nthe UK currently (30% of ICUs), with a large variety of\nmodels and funding structures, there exists a window of\nopportunity to evaluate this intervention before the intro-\nduction of such clinics becomes more widespread.\nAims and objectives of the study\nThis study aims to test the hypothesis that intensive care\nfollow up programmes are effective and cost-effective at\nimproving physical and psychological quality of life in the\nyear after intensive care discharge. The study will investi-\ngate also these outcomes in patient subgroups classified\naccording to illness severity, intensive care experience,\nanxiety and depression and ICU length of stay. In addi-\ntion, the study will establish the cost-effectiveness of such\nclinics.\nMethods\/Design\nThis is a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised controlled\ntrial. Patients will be randomised to one of two interven-\ntion groups after ICU discharge but prior to discharge\nfrom hospital.\nEthics Approval\nEthics approval was granted from the Fife and Forth Valley\nLocal Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Code: 06\/\nS0501\/26).\nParticipants\nParticipants meeting the inclusion criteria will be\nrecruited from three intensive care units in the UK (2\nteaching hospitals and 1 District General hospital).\nInclusion criteria\nPatients receiving level three dependency care (ICU) at\nany time during their hospital stay and who survive until\nthe time of hospital discharge [23]. There is no evidence\nto guide which patients should be offered this service,\nthus we have chosen to include all patients irrespective of\nICU length of stay.\nExclusion criteria\nPatients will be excluded if they are: aged under 18 years;\nnot expected to survive to leave hospital; unable to com-\nplete questionnaires; unable to attend clinics, or if they are\nunable or unwilling to consent.\nOutcome measures\nPrimary measures\nHR-QOL 12 months after ICU discharge as measured by\nthe physical and mental component scores of the Short\nForm-36 (SF-36) [24,25]. This is a comprehensive, generic\n36-item questionnaire [26,27], well accepted by different\npatient groups, is reliable [27,28], valid [26,29], showsPage 2 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2007, 7:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/7\/116sensitivity to change over time [30,31], and takes minutes\nto complete [32]. The SF-36 has been widely used in this\npatient population [2].\nSecondary measures\nHR-QOL will be assessed at six months after ICU dis-\ncharge. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using EQ-5D\n[33]; incidence and severity of posttraumatic psychopa-\nthology as measured by Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS);\nanxiety and depression using Hospital Anxiety and\nDepression Scale (HADS) will be assessed at both six and\ntwelve months. Contacts with health services measured as\npart of the economic analysis; patient satisfaction will be\nassessed at twelve months using a patient satisfaction sur-\nvey; primary and secondary health care costs in the year\nafter hospital discharge, and mortality in the twelve\nmonths after ICU discharge. All non-clinic interventions\nwill be monitored and documented. These data will be\ncollected from hospital case notes review and patient\nquestionnaires.\nThe EQ-5D assesses five attributes of quality of life,\nnamely mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain\/discom-\nfort, and anxiety and depression [2]. An overall single\nscore is obtained which can then be converted into a util-\nity score. The DTS [34] will assess posttraumatic psycho-\npathology and the HADS [35], anxiety and depression.\nBoth the DTS and HADS have been validated in this\npatient population [6,9,16,19]. The DTS has been used\nwidely in the initial assessment of patients at risk of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It measures all core\nsymptoms of PTSD i.e. intrusion, avoidance and hyperar-\nousal and has a 'cut-off' score of 27 or more that indicates\nsignificant posttraumatic psychopathology whilst a score\nof 40 or more indicates a likely diagnosis of PTSD [34].\nThe HADS questionnaire contains 14 statements and scor-\ning results in scales of 0\u201321 for anxiety and depression\nrespectively. Scores of 8\u201310 indicate the possibility of anx-\niety or depression, and 11 and above indicate that these\nare likely to be present.\nThe Intensive Care Experience Questionnaire (ICE) will\nbe used to assess patients' perceptions of their experience\n[8]. This measure assesses four aspects of such an experi-\nence \u2013 'awareness of surroundings', 'frightening experi-\nences', 'recall of experiences', and 'satisfaction with care'.\nPrevious work has demonstrated its association with both\nshort and long-term psychological outcome [8], and we\nhave used the median value from the 'frightening experi-\nences' aspect as the score for the randomisation proce-\ndure.\nIntervention Group\nThese patients will be randomised to the ICU follow up\nprogramme and attend clinic appointments at 2 \u2013 3\nmonths and 9 months after hospital discharge. The design\nand timing of these clinics has been determined by the\nguidelines on ICU follow up from the Outreach Forum\n[11] and by the information collected from our survey of\ncurrent practice. Clinics will be primarily nurse-led with\nsupport from an intensive care doctor. This doctor will be\navailable to consult with the patient (at the nurse's\nrequest) to discuss medical aspects of the patient's origi-\nnal ICU stay or ongoing treatment issues relating to ICU\nmanagement.\nEvidence suggests that a self-directed rehabilitation pro-\ngramme may improve outcome after ICU [19]. Therefore\nimmediately after enrolment patients will be offered a\nself-directed rehabilitation programme to follow at home.\nThis will be individualised to each patient after a discus-\nsion between the clinic nurse and a physiotherapist\ninvolved in the patient's hospital care.\nPrior to the clinic appointments the ICU follow-up nurse\nwill review the patient's case notes and clinical audit data-\nbase to highlight any specific issues which might have\narisen between discharge and the clinic appointment. The\nclinic consultation will be structured using a proforma\nwhich has been developed in centres with experience of\nfollowing up these patients. Patients and relatives will\nhave the opportunity to discuss their ICU experiences and\nthis will be informed by responses to specific items\nincluded in the proforma and also by a free ranging dis-\ncussion led by the patients and their families.\nPhysical recovery will be assessed at the clinic using a\nstructured questionnaire currently used by one of the\nexisting centres. This is divided into two sections with one\nasking about both general health and specific problems or\nchanges since being in intensive care. These reflect our cur-\nrent understanding of such problems, [4,5] for example\nhoarseness, breathlessness, eating difficulties, joint stiff-\nness, parasthesia, concentration and memory difficulties.\nWhere indicated patients may be referred to specialist\nservices e.g. physiotherapy. Psychological recovery will be\nassessed using the standardised screening measures, and\npatients scoring above the 'cut-point' scores will be\nreferred to a mental health professional (such as a clinical\npsychologist, psychiatrist or mental health nurse) for\nreview.\nCurrent drug therapy will be reviewed. It is common for\ndrugs started during the ICU stay to be continued unnec-\nessarily long after hospital discharge. The clinic nurse will\nreview current medications and, in liaison with the ICU\ndoctor, will consider the appropriateness of continuing\nthese therapies.Page 3 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2007, 7:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/7\/116Patients will be offered an ICU visit if appropriate at an\nother time. The presence of altered memories and delu-\nsional ideation are related to severe psychological mor-\nbidity after ICU discharge. A return visit to ICU will only\nbe offered if the patient has no psychological problems on\nscreening (or after assessment by mental health profes-\nsional if caseness was established on screening). For cer-\ntain patients a visit to the ICU is recognised to help to\ndevelop greater understanding of their memories and\ndelusions, and may aid recovery.\nAfter each clinic visit, a review letter explaining the\npatient's progress will be sent to the general practitioner\n(GP). For good clinical practice the patient's GP will be\ninformed of the patient's status and any referrals required\nas a result of the clinic visit. All interventions will use\nstandard NHS processes, which reflect the pragmatic\nnature of this study.\nThe interventions are clearly specified and, wherever pos-\nsible, chosen to replicate the standard processes of the\nNHS in the UK to allow the study intervention to be repro-\nduced accurately in all study centres. However, to ensure\nthat trial patients always receive the appropriate trial inter-\nventions we have also organised direct, assured and\nnamed pathways for referral to specialist services.\nWe have chosen to have three trial centres with one study\nnurse carrying out the intervention in each centre. These\nnurses will be trained together by nurses who currently\ncarry out ICU follow up programmes to ensure a high\nlevel of standardisation; their application of the protocol\nwill be monitored.\nStandard care\nIn line with standard clinical practice in the UK patients\nallocated to the standard care group will have no intensive\ncare follow-up after hospital discharge. Patients will be\nfollowed-up for the trial outcome measures and end\npoints only over the first year after hospital discharge. In\nline with good clinical practice, if there are concerns about\nthe well being of these patients at trial follow-up, a GP let-\nter will be generated.\nProcedure\nTrial recruitment and baseline measurements\nPatients will be approached in the period after ICU dis-\ncharge and before hospital discharge, when their condi-\ntion has been identified as stable and they are able to give\ninformed consent. The local trial nurse will explain the\ntrial and allow time for the patients to read an informa-\ntion sheet before seeking written informed consent.\nPatients will have baseline measurements recorded before\nallocation to their study group. Clinically-gathered data\non patient demographics, ICU diagnosis, ICU stay, sever-\nity of illness using the Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic\nHealth Evaluation (APACHE II) system [36], APACHE II\nco-morbidity score, ICU interventions and sedative use\nwill be extracted from clinical audit data which is col-\nlected routinely during ICU stay in all units and available\nat time of enrolment. Also at baseline we will measure SF-\n36, EQ-5D, ICE score and HADS score before group allo-\ncation.\nAllocation of participants to trial groups\nAfter recruitment the patients will be randomised using\nthe existing central automated computerised telephone\nrandomisation service within the Centre for Healthcare\nRandomised Trials (CHaRT) in the Health Services\nResearch Unit in the University of Aberdeen. Allocation\nwill incorporate randomisation at baseline according to\nage, sex, HADS score, APACHE II, ICE questionnaire score\nand trial centre\nMethods for protecting against other sources of bias\nDue to the nature of the trial intervention, the nurses and\ndoctors performing trial intervention cannot be blind to\nthe trial group allocation. The researchers who measure\ntrial end points and who will analyse the data will be\nblinded to the trial groups. To reduce bias, the principal\noutcome measures are questionnaires completed by par-\nticipants at a time equivalent to three months after each\nclinic assessment. The analyses will be based on the 'inten-\ntion to treat' principle including patients who cannot\nattend clinics due to psychiatric treatment.\nFrequency and duration of follow up\nPatients will be followed-up at six and twelve months for\nthe patient-assessed measures of outcome. Postal ques-\ntionnaires, rather than in-person assessment, have been\nchosen to avoid the six months outcome measurement\nacting as a trial intervention. This will also help to stand-\nardise the method of data collection.\nSample size\nPrevious studies performed in Aberdeen have shown a SF-\n36 mean physical component score (PCS) of 35 (S.D. 14)\nin ICU patients one year after ICU discharge (50 being the\npopulation norm). We have powered this study to detect\na difference of 5 PCS points (0.36 SDs) increase in the\nclinic group compared to the standard care group (i.e. 35\nto 40). For an unadjusted analysis, 123 patients per group\nwould be required to detect this difference with 80%\npower and \u03b1 of 0.05. However, data from previous studies\nin Aberdeen [2] indicate that the correlation between\nbaseline, 3 month and 12 month SF-36 scores were at\nleast 0.6. Such high correlations imply that the sample\nsize could be reduced by 36% and the study would still\ndetect a 5-point difference. Taking a more conservative\nestimate of 30% reduction in sample size, we would needPage 4 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2007, 7:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/7\/11686 patients per group (172 total) to detect this difference\nwith an 80% power at an \u03b1 of 0.05. In practice, the power\nshould be greater than 80% once the randomisation vari-\nables have been included in the statistical modelling. In\nour previous work we have found that 20% of patients\nwho are discharged alive from hospital are lost to follow\nup\/do not return questionnaires over the first year [2,6,8].\nWe will attempt to minimise this form of trial loss by\nkeeping records of patients' telephone contact details as\nwell as secondary contact names and addresses. All\npatients will be contacted by phone if they fail to return\nquestionnaires and asked if they want to continue with\nthe study. Nevertheless, we are assuming a 20% loss to fol-\nlow-up and 20% mortality at 12 months; thus, the total\nnumber of patients to be recruited will be inflated to 135\nper group or 270 in total.\nPlanned analyses\nThe outcomes will be compared between groups using\ngeneralised linear models which adjust for the randomisa-\ntion factors. The model used will reflect the type of out-\ncome data. For the primary outcome statistical\nsignificance will be at the 5% level (2P < 0.05) and 95%\nconfidence intervals will be derived. A priori subgroup\nanalysis will be undertaken for severity of illness\n(APACHE II), APACHE II co-morbidity, ICE score [8] and\nICU length of stay. All subgroup analyses will seek stricter\nlevels of significance (2P < 0.01). Data will be analysed\nusing SPSS software.\nEconomic issues\nA formal economic evaluation is an integral part of this\nproject. Cost per participant for each arm of the trial will\nbe calculated. An estimate of primary and secondary care\nresource utilisation per patient will be made using patient\nquestionnaires and review of hospital notes over the first\nyear after hospital discharge. Unit costs\/prices will be\nobtained using published estimates for health care serv-\nices and\/or interventions as well as study specific esti-\nmates [37-39]. QALYs will be calculated using the area\nunder the curve method. For this, EQ-5D questionnaire\nresponses will be valued using UK population tariffs [33].\nThe estimation of QALYs will take account of the mortal-\nity of study participants. Participants who die within the\nfollow-up period will be assigned a zero utility weight\nfrom their death to the end of the follow-up. QALYs\nbefore death will be calculated using linear extrapolation\nbetween QALY scores. Point estimates for mean costs and\nmean QALYs will be derived for treatment and control\ngroups to obtain Incremental Cost per QALY gained.\nMeasures of variance of outcomes are likely to involve\nbootstrapping estimates for costs and QALYs. Results will\nbe presented using Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Curves\n(CEACs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity anal-\nysis will be developed to address different types of uncer-\ntainties within the economic evaluation such as\ndifferences in death rate. An element of this sensitivity\nanalysis will be to explore the impact of extrapolating to a\nlonger time than that afforded by the trial. This will be\ninformed by previous research in which we have been\ninvolved [2,6,8], and will use a variety of modelling tech-\nniques. Subgroup analysis will follow the subgroup defi-\nnitions within the trial.\nConclusion\nThe provision of intensive care follow-up clinics within\nthe UK has developed in an ad hoc manner, is inconsist-\nent in both the number of hospitals offering such a service\nor in the type of service offered. This study provides the\nopportunity to evaluate such services both in terms of\npatient benefit and cost-effectiveness. The results of this\nstudy therefore will inform clinical practice and policy\nwith regard to the appropriate development of such serv-\nices aimed at improving outcomes after intensive care.\nAbbreviations\nUK: United Kingdom\nICU: Intensive Care Unit\nHRQoL: Health-related Quality of Life\nNHS: National Health Service\nSF-36: Short-form 36\nQALYs: Quality-adjusted life years\nDTS: Davidson Trauma Scale\nHADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\nPTSD: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.\nICE: Intensive Care Experience Questionnaire\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors contributed to the writing of the study proto-\ncol, are grant holders and approved the final version.
