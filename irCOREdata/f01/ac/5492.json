From an economic point of view it is often difficult to find any evidence of the\nbenefits of technology (Landauer 1995). However, when there is \u201ca good fit between a partic-\nular learning situation and specific technical solution\u201d striking positive results can be found\n(Draper, Cargill, and Cutts 2002, 16). The benefits of using computer games which allow\nstudents (children in these particular cases) to learn as they play are demonstrated in games\nlike \u2018Kahootz\u2019 (http:\/\/www.kahootz.com\/), \u2018Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?\u2019\n(http:\/\/www.learningcompany.com\/) and \u2018Zoombinies\u2019 (http:\/\/www.learningcompany.com\/\n) which require and train problem-solving abilities. Going a step beyond such computer games\nare immersive virtual worlds (IVWs) which allow students to engage in experiential learning\nthrough role-playing, and has been recognised as a useful means of learning new skills,\npracticing problem-solving and gaining experience. Mason and Mitroff state that \u201cstories,\ndrama, role-plays, art, graphics, one-to-one contact and group discussions may be more effec-\ntive in some information contexts [\u2026 over] the language of abstract symbols and \u2018hard\u2019 data\u201d\n*Corresponding author. Email: richards@ics.mq.edu.au\n232  D. Richards et al.\n(1973, 484). IVWs offer a means to facilitate distributed learning that is not restricted to a\nspecific physical location or time. Further, the costs involved in bringing people together\nand setting up a convenient and simulated or real environment are reduced. In many cases,\nsuch as training fire fighters to put out a house fire (for example, St. Julian and Shaw 2003),\nan IVW makes possible something that is prohibitively expensive, dangerous or undesirable\nin the natural world.\nTo date, the IVW field has been driven by the entertainment industry rather than educa-\ntionalists. The result has been that while examples of successful and useful systems can be\nfound, there is often little understanding and usually no theory behind whether or why\nsomething does or does not assist learning. Much of the use of games and IVWs in educa-\ntion is based on assumptions such as that interactivity will produce better learning and that\nimmersion will produce greater engagement and lead to better learning. But the evidence\nfor such assumptions is not clear. For example, in our earlier experiments we found that\ninteractivity does not always lead to improved learning (Richards 2006). Despite the lack of\ntheory and empirical evidence for the value or role that music plays (a discussion of relevant\nissues can be found in Zehnder and Lipscomb 2006), we nevertheless find music within\nmost, if not all, game environments. We can conclude that game developers intuitively\nbelieve that music is a desirable feature even if its effects are not understood. In this paper\nwe report our investigations of music within an IVW and its effect on learning while consid-\nering what others have found in related areas.\nLiterature review\nOne of the most well-known studies concerning music and intelligence produced the so-\ncalled \u2018Mozart Effect\u2019 (Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky 1993). This study investigated the effect of\nlistening to classical music before subjects performed a spatial reasoning test. They found\nthat 36 college students who listened to 10 minutes of Mozart\u2019s Sonata for Two Pianos in\nD Major, K448, scored 8\u20139 points higher in a subsequent spatial ability IQ test, compared\nto when they listened to a relaxation tape or to no audio stimulus at all. The results have\nbeen heavily discussed in the literature and other researchers have tried to replicate the\nresults, some with success (Rideout and Dougherty 1998) and others not (McKelvie and\nLow 2002). The current view is that such effects of music on spatial-temporal processing\nare related to temporary changes in mood and arousal levels that arise from music listening\n(Husain, Thompson, and Schellenberg 2002; Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain 2001).\nAlong these lines, Bulgarian psychologist Lozanov (1992) recommended several specific\nmusical pieces that make listeners open to suggestion and put the listener into a state of\nmind that is beneficial for learning foreign languages (Lozanov 1988).\nA somewhat different study was conducted by McFarland and Kennison (1988) who\nfound that subjects who had to solve a tactual maze task with either their right or left hand\nperformed badly when they were listening to music with the ear that was on the same side\nof the body as the hand they were performing the task with, due to \u2018intrahemispheric compe-\ntition\u2019. Typical of many music studies, under some circumstances music improved perfor-\nmance and at other times worsened performance. Another study linking music and learning\nat the psycho-physiological level was conducted by Dryden and Vos (2001) who found that\nfor learning, the \u2018relaxed alertness\u2019 state of mind known as the alpha state was the most\nbeneficial.\nMuch of the research on the role of music on learning attributes an indirect link between\nthe two. For example, Vester (1975) says that we learn and remember more, the more senses\nare included in the learning process. We could thus conclude that when we add music to\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   233\nvisual and\/or other aural stimuli, greater learning is possible. Davies states that \u201cMusic\u2019s\npower to evoke emotions also enhances learning\u201d, and goes on to say that \u201cheightened\ninvolvement creates a stronger neural connection, which in turn makes it easier to remember\ninformation\u201d (2000, 149). We believe that this is even truer if the visual and the aural senses\nare combined. In our earlier work (Fassbender and Heiden 2006), we found evidence for the\nbenefit of the inclusion of the visual sense on learning. Our study included \u2018The Virtual\nMemory Palace\u2019, a 3D environment which offers the possibility to freely explore and utilise\na virtual three-dimensional architectural representation of an ancient Greek (and formerly\npurely mental) memory technique.\nTwo areas of research particularly relevant to our study which we discuss further in the\nnext section, are the work by Boltz, Schulkind, and Kantra (1991) on mood congruence in\nfilm music, and the work by Thompson and colleagues on the role of pitch and tempo on\nmood (Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain 2001; Husain, Thompson, and Schellenberg\n2002).\nBoltz, Schulkind, and Kantra (1991) investigated the effects of background music on\nthe remembering of filmed events and found that participants remembered visual informa-\ntion (i.e. movie scenes) better if such information was accompanied by mood-congruent\nmusic. Further experiments showed that mood-congruent pairings of video and audio are\njointly encoded into the cognitive system (Boltz 2004). In their experiments, Thompson,\nSchellenberg, and Husain (2001) found that participants performed significantly better in\nan associated paper-folding and cutting task when they listened to a \u2018pleasant and\nenergetic\u2019 Mozart piece in major key as opposed to a second group who listened to a \u2018slow,\nsad\u2019 Albioni piece in minor key. They see that the \u2018Mozart Effect\u2019 is more likely to be a\nresult of mood and arousal, and conclude that: \nIt is possible, then, that the Mozart effect has little to do with Mozart in particular or with\nmusic in general. Rather, it may represent an example of enhanced performance caused by\nmanipulation of arousal or mood. (Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain 2001, 248)\nResearch question\nLooking at the literature, there seem to be contradictory opinions and inconclusive evidence\nabout the effect of music on learning. In our investigations we aim to explore whether music\nincreases learning in an IVW. Our particular focus is on memorisation of facts. Our goal is\nto contribute insights and rigour to the study and practice of pedagogy via IVWs and\nprovide a basis for theory development in the field. To this end, we have designed an IVW\nwhich serves a dual function: to provide a learning environment for the history of the\nMacquarie Lighthouse as well as an experimental environment within which our investiga-\ntions can be made.\nIt is commonly observed that players frequently become completely occupied within an\nIVW and their attention is so intensely focused on the fantasy world in which they are roam-\ning about, that almost nothing can disturb them and get them out of these worlds and back\ninto reality. One explanation for this sense of engagement could be Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s\n\u2018Flow\u2019 theory (1990) which involves the \u201cfeeling of complete and energized focus in an\nactivity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfilment\u201d (Chen 2007, 31). Another explana-\ntion could be that \u201cvideo game play is an activity which lies in the domain of intrinsic\nmotivation\u201d (Holt 2000, 9). Furthermore, music seems to have an effect on motivation. In\nan unpublished doctoral thesis by Weisskoff (1981) \u201cstudents who received the music\ncondition scored significantly higher with regard to continuing motivation\u201d (cited in Eady\n234  D. Richards et al.\nand Wilson 2004, 243) when reporting about a study of children receiving language lessons\n\u2013 with or without background music.\nFrom our experience and observation, and in line with Zehnder and Lipscomb (2006),\nwe believe that music contributes to the sense of total immersion within an IVW. Conse-\nquently, the aim of our research is to examine effects of music on memory for events and\nfacts that are learned during game experiences and to explore the significance of music for\nfeelings of immersion in game-like virtual-immersive environments. In our study we\nconsider the potential effects of background music on the perception and memory of events\nand facts experienced in an IVW. As music is multidimensional, in our initial experiments\nwe have narrowed our focus to the effect of pitch and tempo of music based on their power-\nful effects on emotion and mood (Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain 2001; Ilie and\nThompson 2006; Boltz 2004; Boltz, Schulkind, and Kantra 1991). Consequently, our\nresearch question asks how changes in pitch and tempo of soundtracks of computer-based\nrole-playing games affect the memory for the historical facts delivered by an avatar (virtual\npersona) in the IVW.\nThe Macquarie Lighthouse history lesson IVW\nAs a precursor to answering the above research question it was necessary to create an IVW.\nTo provide such a learning environment we chose to create a computer-animated history\nlesson presenting the history of the Macquarie Lighthouse, the first lighthouse of Australia\nand the southern hemisphere. Despite this importance to Australian settlement, the history\nof the Macquarie Lighthouse is not widely known and is thus an ideal topic for evaluating\nlearning of historical facts. Since the effect of interactivity on learning was not part of this\nstudy, we created a non-interactive computer-animated history lesson to minimise the\nnumber of variables and provide greater control. Even though the course was non-interac-\ntive, it was created to look and feel like a typical conversation with an avatar in a fully\nfeatured computer role-playing game and IVW. During the computer-animated history\nlesson, numerous facts about the history of the lighthouse, including dates, names of people,\nships, equipment and places are presented. Twenty-nine questions were asked of partici-\npants following the presentation to determine how well they recalled the information given.\nTo create the Macquarie Lighthouse IVW, a game mod (the technical term used to refer\nto a modification of the original application) was developed with \u2018The Elder Scrolls\nConstruction Set\u2019 (TESCS) (http:\/\/www.elderscrolls.com\/downloads\/updates_utilities.htm).\nTESCS is an expansion for the game \u2018Elder Scrolls 4 \u2013 Oblivion\u2019 (Bethesda Softworks: http:\/\n\/www.elderscrolls.com\/home\/home.htm) which allows the creation of complete virtual\nscenarios and supplies the developer with the necessary tools to design a virtual world in his\nor her own style. In the first step, the landscape surrounding the Macquarie Lighthouse was\nmodelled in TESCS. To achieve a high level of authenticity, the landscape was modelled by\nmeans of an accurate land survey supplied by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. After-\nwards, a 3D model of the Macquarie Lighthouse was created with 3D Studio Max (http:\/\/\nwww.autodesk.com) and then imported into TESCS (Figure 1). The avatar in the foreground\nis a fictitious descendant of the first lighthouse keeper, and delivers the history of the light-\nhouse to the users.\nFigure 1. A 3D model of the Macquarie Lighthouse together with a virtual Avatar who is explaining the history of the lighthouse to the users.Six different versions of this history lesson were produced using different background\nmusical stimuli, which will be explained in more detail later. The computer-animated\nhistory lesson was displayed by means of a Cave-like display system called a \u2018Cone\u2019 to\nincrease the level of visual immersion. Figure 2 shows a pilot-tester who is watching the\nvideo narration and listening to the avatar.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   235\nFigure 2. A pilot-tester watching and listening to the 3D narration about the history of the Macquarie Lighthouse.The Cone-display system consists of three projectors which display the virtual world\nonto a semi-cylindrical screen canvas. The user is positioned slightly off centre towards the\ncanvas to allow a 160\u00b0 field of view (FOV) which simulates almost the maximum of 180\u00b0\nof the natural human FOV. Through this setup the virtual reality occupies most of the user\u2019s\nvisual sense and the user gets the impression that the world displayed on the screen canvas\nis almost real; he or she feels immersed in this virtual reality.\nFigure 2. A pilot-tester watching and listening to the 3D narration about the history of the Macquarie\nLighthouse.\nFigure 1. A 3D model of the Macquarie Lighthouse together with a virtual Avatar who is explaining\nthe history of the lighthouse to the users.\n236  D. Richards et al.\nMethodology \u2013 stimuli and measures\nIn order to gain a somewhat representative sample of the computer role-playing game genre,\nthe soundtracks from four contemporary computer role-playing games, namely \u2018Oblivion\u2019\n(http:\/\/www.elderscrolls.com), \u2018Baldur\u2019s Gate\u2019 (http:\/\/www.bioware.com\/games\/baldurs_\ngate\/), \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 (http:\/\/www.worldofwarcraft.com) and \u2018Icewind Dale\u2019 (http:\/\/\nwww.blackisle.com\/ or http:\/\/www.mobygames.com\/game\/icewind-dale), were selected for\nmanipulation. From each soundtrack of each game three musical pieces were pre-selected.\nThese three pre-selected pieces were then presented to a group of six pilot-testers who were\nrecruited from the Department of Computing at Macquarie University. All of the pilot-\ntesters have extensive experience with computer role-playing games and the associated\nsoundtracks. The pilot-testers were asked to rank the musical pieces on a scale from 1 to 5\nas being: (a) not representative (1) or representative (5) for the role-playing game genre; and\n(b) not suitable (1) or suitable (5) for the 3D animated video presentation. The musical\npieces that scored the highest overall value in both categories were then selected for further\nexperiments.\nTempo and pitch manipulations\nAs discussed earlier, two musical attributes that have powerful effects on emotion and mood\n(which in consequence might have an effect on learning and immersion) are pitch and tempo\n(Husain, Thompson, and Schellenberg 2002; Thompson, Schellenberg, and Husain 2001).\nFour musical pieces (Oblivion, Baldur\u2019s Gate, World of Warcraft, Icewind Dale) were\nselected and manipulated in tempo and pitch, based on work by Ilie and Thompson (2006).\nTempo was reduced\/increased by 21%\/26% and pitch was lowered\/increased by two\nsemitones. The manipulations were accomplished using a Macbook Pro in Ableton Live\n6.0.7. Ableton Live is a professional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software, which\nallows convenient and high quality tempo and pitch manipulations. Resulting pieces were\nthen presented to three music experts from the Department of Contemporary Music Studies\nat Macquarie University. None of the experts found irritating distortions or could identify\nthe manipulations as such. The three possible tempos (slow, medium\/original, fast) and\nthree possible pitches (low, medium\/original and high) resulted in nine possible combina-\ntions. For reasons of practicality (size of participant pool, available laboratory time, etc.) it\nwas decided to test only five of the nine possibilities: Condition 1: S\/L \u2013 Slow Tempo\/Low\nPitch; Condition 3: F\/L \u2013 Fast Tempo\/Low Pitch; Condition 5: M\/M \u2013 Medium Tempo\/\nMedium Pitch (tempo and pitch unaltered); Condition 7: S\/H \u2013 Slow Tempo\/High Pitch;\nCondition 9: F\/H \u2013 Fast Tempo\/High Pitch. Each of the five manipulations was performed\non the four different musical pieces, indicating that all musical pieces received the same\ntempo\/pitch manipulation. A control group (Condition 10) was assigned to the \u2018No Music\u2019\ncondition and during the 3D history course they only listened to the voice of the avatar\nwithout any musical background.\nExperiment 1\nA total of 72 undergraduate students (45 female, 27 male) from 19 to 56 years old (mean\n24.2 years of age) were recruited by advertisement on campus and from introductory statis-\ntics and computing classes at Macquarie University, Sydney. They were allocated into six\nexperimental conditions; therefore each experimental condition had 12 participants. Fifteen\nparticipants indicated English as their first language while 57 participants answered that\nEnglish was their \u2018second or other\u2019 language.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   237\nThe experiment consisted of three stages: \n\u25cf Stage 1 \u2013 a short pre-experiment biographical questionnaire (e.g. age, gender, first\nlanguage, etc.).\n\u25cf Stage 2 \u2013 an 11:38 minute video narration of the history course. Participants sat in the\ncentre of the display system where they watched and listened to the stimuli wearing\nhigh quality noise-cancelling stereo headphones.\n\u25cf Stage 3 \u2013 a post-experiment set of questionnaires: \n\u25cf 29 questions about the history of the Macquarie Lighthouse as covered in the\nvideo narration multiple-choice questionnaire about facts that they just learned\nin the history lesson (e.g., what was the name of the first lighthouse keeper, in\nwhich year was the first lighthouse built, how many people were stationed at\nthe lighthouse, etc.).\n\u25cf 27 questions about the immersiveness of the video narration (e.g., how well\nwere you concentrating, how much did you lose track of time).\n\u25cf 6 questions about participants\u2019 prior experience with music and computer\/\nconsole games (e.g., how many years have you been playing a musical instru-\nment, how many years have you been playing computer\/console games).\nResults for Experiment 1\nWe consider the results regarding the effect of music, levels of concentration and the sense\nof immersion on the remembering of facts in each of the following subsections.\nResults for music\nFigure 3 shows the mean number of correctly answered questions from the content section\nof the questionnaire for each of the experimental conditions along with the standard\ndeviations for the participants.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the mean number of correctly answered questions in the virtual-immersive 3D narration. Histograms show the frequencies of correctly answered questions as bars and the normal distribution as a normal curve.Descriptive statistics in Figure 3 show the mean scores and standard deviations for each\nof the five categories of musical manipulations and the control group, as well as for each\ntempo and pitch condition as aggregate. The mean number of correctly answered questions\nranged from a minimum of 14.7 questions by the control group without music (Experiment\nCondition 10) to a maximum of 17.6 questions by the group under the slow tempo\/low pitch\ncondition (Experiment Condition 1). The magnitudes of the mean scores of the musical\nconditions are close to each other and the variations are wide, therefore it is hard to detect\nany statistically significant difference between the means (only a difference of 1.7\/29 facts\nbetween the highest and lowest number of correctly answered questions). Even though the\nparticipants who listened to background music during the computer-animated history lesson\nof the Macquarie Lighthouse performed better than their peers in the no-music control\ngroup, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the experimental (music)\nconditions were not a significant main effect for learning (F(5,71) = 0.63, p = 0.68). In other\nwords, we were unable to detect any statistically significant difference between the mean\nnumber of correctly answered questions by participants under the six experimental condi-\ntions. We also observe from Figure 3 that the slow tempo\/low pitch participants are the best\nperformers in terms of learning (mean = 17.6).\nIn Figure 4 we can see the mean number of questions answered correctly was higher\nunder the low pitch condition compared to the high pitch condition. Furthermore, the slow\ntempo (upper light grey line) had a better effect on learning than the fast tempo (lower dark\n238  D. Richards et al.\ngrey line), regardless of the pitch. We investigated the effects of tempo and pitch on learning\nby using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Neither tempo nor pitch as main effects\nhad a statistically significant effect on learning (both F(1,45) = 0.44, p = 0.51). The interac-\ntion of these effects was also not statistically significant (F(1,44) = 0.04, p = 0.85).\nFigure 4. The mean number of questions answered correctly by tempo and pitch (original soundtrack condition - medium tempo\/medium pitch is removed).Each study participant was exposed to one piece of game music (Oblivion, Baldur\u2019s Gate,\nWorld of Warcraft, Icewind Dale), except the participants in the control group (no music \u2013\n12 participants). Each game music was listened to by 15 participants. We compared the\neffects of different game music on learning regardless of which tempo and\/or pitch was used.\nWe found a significant difference between the \u2018Oblivion\u2019 soundtrack and the \u2018No Music\u2019\ncondition using Dunnett\u2019s two-sided t-test (p = 0.034). Those participants who listened to\nthe \u2018Oblivion\u2019 soundtrack, on average, answered 4.4 (95% confidence intervals 0.3\u20138.5)\nquestions more correctly than their peers in the \u2018No Music\u2019 (control group) (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. The mean number of questions answered correctly while listening to game music or no music (control).\nResults regarding concentration\nA one-way ANOVA contrast test established that music made it subjectively easier to\nconcentrate (Table 1). Participants under the \u2018Slow Tempo\/Low Pitch\u2019 condition found it\nFigure 3. Comparison of the mean number of correctly answered questions in the virtual-immersive\n3D narration. Histograms show the frequencies of correctly answered questions as bars and the nor-\nmal distribution as a normal curve.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   239\neasiest to concentrate. Participants in the control group (no music) found it hardest to\nconcentrate. Participants who did not listen to music found it harder to concentrate with the\nbiggest difference between Slow Tempo\/Low Pitch and No Music (Figure 6).\nFigure 6. \u2018How hard was it to concentrate?\u2019 under the influence of different musical background stimuli.\nResults regarding immersion\nMoreover, to investigate the feeling of immersion we asked participants a number of related\nquestions including the degree to which they lost track of time in the IVW. They answered\non a 5 point scale from 0 having \u2018Not at all\u2019 lost track of time and 4 having \u2018Completely\u2019\nFigure 4. The mean number of questions answered correctly by tempo and pitch (original\nsoundtrack condition - medium tempo\/medium pitch is removed).\nFigure 5. The mean number of questions answered correctly while listening to game music or no\nmusic (control).\n240  D. Richards et al.\nlost track of time. Losing track of time was highly correlated with the total number of\nquestions answered correctly (r = 0.37, p = 0.003). This correlation was statistically signif-\nicant at 0.01 level. The linear regression showed that 35% of variation in the total number\nof questions answered correctly was explained with the degree of losing track of time (R2\n= 0.347). Based on the linear regression, we conclude that on average if participants did not\nlose track of time, they answered 11.8 questions correctly. For each further level of losing\ntrack of time (i.e. from 1 to 4 on the scale) the total number of questions answered correctly\nincreased by 1.9. For example, if participants completely lost track of time, then on average\nthey would have answered 19.4 questions correctly, which is 7.6 more questions than those\nTable 1.

There was no significant relationship\nbetween tempo of the background music and losing track of time.\nExperiment 2\nOne problem that became obvious during analysis of the data from Experiment 1 was that\nthe absolute tempo and pitch of the various soundtracks differed quite widely from each\nother. Other problems were the small number of participants in each of the experimental\nconditions and the \u2018between subjects\u2019 design. These limitations were addressed in Experi-\nment 2. Further, although results were not statistically significant, we were interested in\ntesting the trend in the data showing that the numbers of correctly answered questions are\nrelatively greater with slower tempo and lower pitch. Therefore we decided to narrow our\nfocus by using slow tempo and low pitch experimental conditions. The design of Experi-\nment 2 can be seen in Figure 7. Firstly, the experimental conditions and included variables\nwere reduced to one soundtrack (Oblivion) and a silent condition. These two conditions\nwere then presented to participants in a \u2018within subjects\u2019 design to allow a more direct\nanalysis as opposed to the \u2018between subjects\u2019 design of the first experiment. Thirdly, to\neliminate the problems of differing absolute tempo and pitch, only one version of the tempo\nand pitch manipulations has been used (slow tempo, low pitch which showed beneficial\ntendencies). While we recognise that this experiment design means that the results might not\nbe generalisable for the whole genre of music of computer role-playing games, this design\nallows for a more concise analysis. Also, the overall number of participants needed was\nreduced while increasing the number of participants for each of the new individual condi-\ntions. To provide enough statistical power it was decided to include 24 participants in each\ngroup, resulting in 48 participants overall.\nFigure 7. Experiment design for follow-up experiments focuses on one soundtrack and investigates the effect on memory of one particular soundtrack in a \u2018within subjects\u2019 design.Group 1 watched the computer-animated history lesson with the Oblivion soundtrack\n(slow tempo\/low pitch) in the first half of the lesson and silence in the second half. Group\n2 watched the two conditions in reverse order (silence first, then Oblivion). These parts go\nfor 5:32 (first half) and 5:23 (second half). The slight difference in length is due to a\nsectional break which could only be made after a sentence was finished by the narrator-\navatar. While most of the questions from the questionnaire of the first experiment were re-\nused to allow for cross-analysis, a problem in the original experiment was that the number\nFigure 7. Experiment design for follow-up experiments focuses on one soundtrack and investigates\nthe effect on memory of one particular soundtrack in a \u2018within subjects\u2019 design.\n242  D. Richards et al.\nof facts in the two halves was unbalanced. Thus, four questions were omitted from the first\nhalf and five questions added to the second half. This way there are 15 questions in each\nhalf (30 overall). The complexity and type of questions in both halves are similar.\nFurthermore, some qualitative questions and additional questions regarding immersion\nand presence were included. In this regard, it was decided to also test the effect of different\ndisplay systems on feelings of immersion. Thus, half the participants watched the computer-\nanimated history lesson in the Cone display system and the other half was allocated to a 3-\nmonitor display system on a computer desk.\nPreliminary results for Experiment 2\nThe results show that the change from a \u2018between subjects\u2019 design to a \u2018within subjects\u2019\ndesign could not confirm the benefit of the Oblivion soundtrack at slow tempo and low\npitch. In other words, we did not observe a direct statistically significant difference between\nthe half where participants listened to background music and the half where they listened\nonly to the narrator without background music. However, the different display systems\nshowed a statistically significant difference (p = .032) in favour of the 3-monitor solution.\nParticipants in the Cone system remembered 14.96 items on average and 17.96 items in the\n3-monitor display system. These results then led to closer investigations which revealed a\nthree-way interaction between the display system, the music\/no-music condition and the\ntwo halves of the history lesson. Interestingly, when the Cone and 3-monitor display groups\nwere separated and the music condition was then compared with the no-music condition\nwithin these groups, it was discovered that those participants in the 3-monitor solution who\nlistened to music in the first half of the computer-animated history lesson remembered\nsignificantly more facts from the second half than their peers who listened to no music in\nthe first half. In contrast, those participants in the Cone system performed significantly\nbetter if they listened to no music in the first half and music in the second half. These results\nare statistically significant at .027 (3-monitor) and .017 (Cone) level. A possible explanation\nfor this result is that participants in the Cone system experienced cognitive overload when\nfaced with the overwhelming experience of an unfamiliar display system together with the\nmusic. One observation by the experimenters from this second experiment is that partici-\npants seemed to feel much more comfortable with the 3-monitor solution than in the Cone\nsystem. However, analysis and interpretation of these results are ongoing.\nGeneral discussion\nIn summary, changes in tempo and pitch did not show a statistically significant difference\non the amount of correctly answered questions. Nor did \u2018Music\u2019 versus \u2018No Music\u2019 if all\nsoundtracks were combined in the same (Music) category. However, when we looked at\neach individual soundtrack and compared it to the \u2018No Music\u2019 control group in the first\nexperiment, we found a statistically significant difference between the Oblivion soundtrack\nand the control group. The statistically significant result for the Oblivion soundtrack\nindicates that it may be beneficial for encoding information into memory. When we\nconsider what distinguishes Oblivion from the other samples, we are not able to pinpoint\ntempo or pitch.\nOne conjecture is that Oblivion could be the most congruent piece for the setting of the\nlighthouse scene. The importance of congruency between music and accompanying media\nhas been the subject of considerable research. Properties of music that are congruent with\naccompanying media act to highlight certain features of that media over others and hence\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   243\ncan greatly influence how those media are remembered. In advertisements for cars, for\nexample, accompanying classical music can act to highly convey both the vitality and high\ncultural associations of the car (Cohen 2001). As another example, music that exhibits an\nunambiguous ending may connote the end of a film (Thompson, Russo, and Sinclair 1994).\nAccording to the congruence-associationist model outlined by Marshall and Cohen (1988),\nsources of congruency act by directing attention to particular aspects of an accompanying\nfilm over others (see also Bolivar, Cohen, and Fentress 1994). These effects on attention, in\nturn, influence interpretations and memory for that material.\nFinally, we found a statistically significant effect between the number of questions\nanswered correctly and the participant\u2019s feeling of immersion in the virtual-immersive\nenvironment. Those who said that they were more immersed (by saying that they lost track\nof time) in the 3D history course remembered more facts than those who said that they did\nnot lose track of time. Concentration was also positively affected in the music conditions.\nConclusions\nThe role of background music in games and IVWs is a largely unexplored field. Previous\nstudies concerning music and learning or intelligence have had mixed results and as in the\ncase of the Mozart effect, it is difficult to repeat findings. In our own studies we did find\none soundtrack which showed a statistically significant improvement in memorisation of\nfacts. We conjectured that the reason may be that the piece of music was most congruent to\nthe content being taught, but clearly more research needs to be conducted in this area. We\nalso found a link between levels of perceived immersion and ability to accurately remember\nfacts. Again the link may not be direct between music, memory and the sense of immersion,\nbut the link is worth investigating further. Further analysis of the data from the second\nexperiment is being conducted to this end. It is our goal to take the field of IVW beyond the\nintuitions of gamers and game developers and to contribute towards unpacking the appeal\nand benefits of IVWs as a learning environment and the role that music may play within that\nenvironment.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Alan Taylor for his contribution, his general interest in this work and particularly for his\ndata analyses related to the experiments.
