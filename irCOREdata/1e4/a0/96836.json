We focus on the interactions between fibroblasts, modelled as\ndiscrete entities, and a continuous extracellular matrix composed of collagen and a fibrin\nbased blood clot There are four basic interactions assumed in the model: fibroblasts orient\nthe collagen matrix, fibroblasts produce and degrade collagen and fibrin and the matrix\ndirects the fibroblasts and determines the speed of the cells. Several factors which influence\nthe alignment of collagen are examined and related to current anti-scarring therapies using\ntransforming growth factor ft. The most influential of these factors are cell speed and, more\nimportantly for wound healing, the influx of fibroblasts from surrounding tissue.\n1. Introduction\nThe healing of full-thickness skin wounds involves a complex sequence of overlapping\nevents. One of the first is the coagulation cascade (Jennings & Hunt, 1992) where\nfibrinogen, a soluble protein in the plasma, is converted to fibrin which polymerizes to\nform a blood clot. This clot forms a provisional matrix for the invasion of various cell types.\nWithin twenty-four to forty-eight hours (Jennings & Hunt, 1992; Forrest, 1983), fibroblasts\nstart to infiltrate the wound and dissolve the fibrin clot, replacing it with a collagen matrix.\nThis is the process which will be modelled in this paper. In the final phase of wound healing\nthe composition of the extracellular matrix is changed over a period of months, again by\ndermal fibroblasts. Experiments showing the growth of scars in parallel with animal growth\n(Armstrong & Ferguson, 1995) suggest a stable, self-reinforcing mechanism. Based on\nevidence such as this, the orientation of the initially deposited collagen is thought to be\nkey in subsequent remodelling, setting a pattern which is then perpetuated. Thus, we focus\n\u00a9 Oxford Univeriity Prcu 2001\n380 J. DALLON ETAL\non the initial collagen deposition. Because wound healing is a complex phenomenon with\nmany interacting factors, mathematical modelling is an ideal tool by which this process\ncan be understood.\nMany mathematical models have been developed which investigate various aspects of\nwound healing. Modelling efforts for dermal repair started by studying wound contraction\nusing a mechanochemical framework originally formulated for embryological pattern\nformation (Tranquillo & Murray, 1992). This model was extended to include different cell\ntypes (Olsen et al., 1995) and a study of non-linear mechanical properties (Tracqui et al,\n1995). These models of wound contraction deal with wound healing at a later stage than\nthat which we are considering. Our work is most closely related to previous models which\nfocus on collagen composition (Dale et al, 1996) and structure (Olsen et al, 1999), but\nwe emphasize the collagen alignment to a greater extent and we incorporate fibroblasts\nin a more biologically realistic manner than previous models. In our work the fibroblasts\nare discrete cells, thus we use discrete components in our modelling approach, a technique\nwhich is now being adopted by a number of researchers to model problems in areas related\nto wound healing, such as angiogenesis and tumour growth and invasion (Anderson &\nChaplain, 1998; Stottetai, 1999; Anderson et al, 2000).\nThere are fundamental differences between fetal and adult wound healing, resulting\nin different outcomes. In adults, the end product is a scar. This is tissue which is less\nfunctional, weaker and cosmetically undesirable. However fetal tissue is repaired with\nreduced or absent scarring (McCallion & Ferguson, 1996) and the realization of this\ndifference has generated a large volume of research activity into mechanisms underlying\nscar formation. The characteristics of scars mentioned previously are a result of altered\nstructure and composition in the dennis. Scars typically have fewer blood vessels supplying\nthe denser connective tissue, which is less elastic. The most significant difference between\nnormal tissue and scar tissue seems to be the orientation of the fibrous matrix. In rodents,\nnormal tissue has a reticular collagen pattern, whereas the collagen in scar tissue forms\nlarge parallel bundles at approximately right angles to the basement membrane (Whitby\n& Ferguson, 1991). Human scar tissue is similar, with greater collagen density, larger\nfibres and more alignment than normal tissue, although the alignment is parallel to the\nskin (Ehrlich & Krummel, 1996). By modelling the production of collagen during tissue\nregeneration, our aim is to understand how the fibroblasts orient the collagen matrix and\nthus form scars.\nThis paper is organized in the following manner. In the next section the model is\ndescribed. In Section 3 the numerical results are presented by first exploring the effects\nof altering key parameters in the model, and the experimental predictions are discussed in\nSection 4. Finally, in Section 5 we conclude with a discussion of the model implications as\nrelated to antiscarring therapies and future work.\n2. The model\nOur model focuses on the interaction between fibroblasts within the wound and\nthe extracellular matrix surrounding them. This interaction divides naturally into two\ncategories: the influence of the extracellular matrix on the fibroblasts and the influence\nof the fibroblasts on the extracellular matrix. After describing the general framework of the\nmodel, we consider these two interactions in turn.\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 381\nTraditionally, models of wound healing have represented the evolving components as\ncontinuum density variables, using partial differential equations to model the interactions.\nThe approach taken here is different in that the cells are represented as discrete\nobjects. Previous authors have studied cellular automata models for fibroblast populations\n(Edelstein-Keshet & Ermentrout, 1990), but our work is novel with its inclusion of cell and\nextracellular matrix interactions. Although a continuum approach makes the model more\namenable to mathematical analysis, it is less realistic for the low fibroblast densities which\nare found in wound healing, where the discrete nature of the fibroblasts is important for\nthe observed microscopic patterns of alignmenL This key difference profoundly influences\nthe formulation of the model, which consists of ordinary differential equations, with the\ninfluence of the fibroblasts being strictly local. The model keeps track of the individual\npaths of the fibroblasts, denoted by f' for i = 1,2, . . . , M where M is the total number\nof cells, and has parameters representing cell properties. Cells can enter the wound region\neither by division or by influx at the boundary of the wound region, representing fibroblasts\nentering from surrounding tissue.\nThe representation of the extracellular matrix follows the traditional modelling route\nin that it is a continuous variable, with vector fields of collagen and fibrin (the blood\nclot) denoted by c(x) and b(x) respectively. The direction of these vectors represents\nthe predominant direction of the protein fibres at the point, and their length corresponds\nto the density of protein (collagen or fibrin) which is scaled to be between 0 and 1-5\nfor the collagen and 0 and 1 for the fibrin. Thus ||c|| = 1 corresponds to the collagen\ndensity of normal skin and ||b|| = 1 represents the fibrin density of a typical blood clot\nSince the extracellular matrix is composed of non-directional fibres, the orientation can be\nrepresented by one of two directions which differ by 180\u00b0. This means that the collagen\nand fibrin are not represented uniquely, so that some care is required in model simulations.\nExtracellular matrix regulation of fibroblast activity\nAlthough several of the extracellular matrix-fibroblast interactions have been experimen-\ntally studied, this area remains poorly understood (Hay, 1991). This is partly because\nall interactions have not been found, but mainly because the processes involved interact\nin a complex manner with non-linear feedback. Mathematical modelling is a powerful\ntool designed to address such complex feedback mechanisms. For simplicity we consider\nonly two effects on the fibroblasts from the extracellular matrix both of which are\nexperimentally well documented. First, fibroblast movement is directed by the orientation\nof the matrix, a phenomenon known as 'contact guidance*. This has been demonstrated\ndirectly when fibroblasts placed on oriented collagen gels invade in the direction of\norientation (Guido & Tranquillo, 1993) with further evidence provided by experiments\ndemonstrating fibroblast migration along fibronectin fibrils (Hsieh & Chen, 1983). In the\nmodel we define the variable v* (t) which represents the combined effect of the fibrin and\ncollagen matrices on a cell's direction by\nv\u00ab'(r) = (1 - a)c(f' (0) + \u00abb(f'\"(0). (1)\n382 J. DALLON EJAL.\nUnless otherwise stated we assume (in the absence of experimental data) that the fibrin and\ncollagen have an equal effect and thus or = 0-5. In addition we define\nwhich allows the cells to be polarized, a property we discuss later. The prime denotes\ndifferentiation with respect to time and r is a time lag. The equation determining f' is\ngiven by\n(3)\nThe extracellular matrix also alters fibroblast speed, an effect taken into account in\nequation (3). In particular, fibroblasts migrate more easily on fibronectin gels than on\ncollagen gels (Wojciak-Stothard et al, 1992). Fibronectin is a protein found in abundance\nin the fibrin-based blood clot, where it coats the fibrin, promoting cell migration into the\nclot (Clark, 1996). Although the model formulation does not explicitly include fibronectin,\nwe assume that it is proportional to the density of fibrin within the blood clot We take the\ncell speed to be a function of collagen and fibronectin densities at the cell location, with the\nspeed increasing with fibronectin density and conversely decreasing with collagen density.\nThe precise functional forms we use are given in the Appendix.\nOur model neglects several known ways in which the extracellular matrix influences\nthe fibroblasts. For example, the collagen content of the cell substrate alters the production\nof different proteins by the fibroblast (Clark et aL, 1995); the extracellular matrix in the\nwound region contains many growth factors and cytokines which alter fibroblast behaviour.\nWe exclude these factors and focus on contact guidance and speed variation, because they\ndirectly affect the alignment of new collagen.\nFibroblast regulation of the extracellular matrix\nThe influence of the fibroblasts on the extracellular matrix can also be divided into\ntwo parts, the first of which is collagen alignment Although collagen can polymerize\ninto thin fibrils, the organization of these into the fibrous structure seen in the dermis\nrequires cellular intervention (Ehrlich & Krummel, 1996). Fibroblasts produce collagen\nin compartments which are formed by deep involutions in the cell membrane (Birk &\nTrelstad, 1986). From this observation, it is theorized that even though the collagen matrix\nis formed in an extracellular space, the cell controls the alignment and structure via the\nmicroenvironment in the involution. We represent the 'combined influence of nearby cells'\nas a weighted sum of the cell direction defined by\nwith the weights designed to restrict the influence to within about 10 \/i.m (see the\nAppendix). We assume that the cells orient or reorient the collagen matrix towards their\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 383\ndirection of motion. This is modelled by an ordinary differential equation for the rate of\nchange of the angle of collagen orientation given by\n- 0 ) (5)= K | |\nwhere 8 is the direction of the collagen matrix at a point in space, K is a parameter which\nmeasures the ability of the fibroblasts to reorder the matrix and 0 is the direction of the\nvector f. The angle changes most when the orientation of the collagen and the combined\ninfluence of the nearby cells differs by 90\u00b0, and does not change at all if they are the same.\nWe also incorporate a time lag in the cell direction to represent the delay between the\norientation of the cell and the actual cell motion.\nThe second way the fibroblasts influence the extracellular matrix is by altering the\ndensity of the two types of protein. We assume that each fibroblast produces collagen at a\nconstant rate and degrades both collagen and fibrin; there is no production of fibrin, which\nis deposited by the blood plasma when the fibrin clot is formed and enters the model as\ninitial conditions. Thus the equations for the protein densities are given by\n= (Pc- dc\\W\\\\) \u00a3 u;(f'\" - x) (6)\n- x ) (7)\nwhere pc, dc and db are positive constants.\nOther properties of the fibroblasts\nThe final elements of the model deal with properties of the fibroblasts: cell polarization\nand cell division. In addition to the contact guidance, cell direction is also affected by the\nmorphology of the cell. When placed on fibrous gels, fibroblasts become highly elongated\n(Dunn & Ebendal, 1978) and are polarized, with clear leading and trailing edges. We model\npolarization by assuming that the cells tend to maintain their current direction of motion\n(see equation (2)). The overall fibroblast direction is thus given by a weighted vector sum\nof the contact guidance direction and the current direction (equation (3)).\nThe other property that we incorporate into the model is cell division. In doing this,\nwe allow for two cell types, those which divide and those which do noL The division\nrate is taken to be constant throughout the simulation, with dividing fibroblasts becoming\nnon-dividing. Because of the discrete nature of the model, it is necessary to explicitly\nseparate the daughter cells by a small distance. This is done by placing the daughter cell\nat a randomly chosen point on the circle centered at the parent's location with a specified\nradius (taken to be 10 \/im).\nMost of the parameters in the model represent quantitative details of fibroblast\nbehaviour, which are not well known. This means that it is important to determine how\nsensitive the results of the model are to the parameters, which is the goal of Section 3. A\nlist of typical parameter values is given in the Appendix.\n384 J. DALLON ETAL.\n3. Variations in model parameters\nHaving given a description of the model in the previous section, we now turn our\nattention to numerical investigations of model behaviour. Figure 1 shows the results of\na typical simulation for tissue regeneration in a rodent slash wound. The domain is a two-\ndimensional cross-section of the wound transverse to the skin surface. Throughout the\nremainder of the paper we treat this as a standard case with which the other simulations\ncan be compared. Figures la and c demonstrate typical features of scarring, in particular\na denser collagen region with more pronounced alignment close to the subcutaneous\nregion; the collagen becomes less organized closer to the skin surface. These are natural\nconsequences of the fact that 80 percent of the fibroblasts which enter the wound from\nthe surrounding tissue do so from the subcutaneous fascia (Adams, 1997). When the cells\nenter the wound region they encounter a randomly aligned fibrin clot which is gradually\ndegraded and replaced with collagen fibres. As the simulation progresses, cells in the\nwound region can divide and other cells can continue moving in from the edges, increasing\nthe cell density until there is a maximum of 600 cells as shown in Fig. Id. High cell density\ncauses more collagen production and fibrin degradation which slows the cells, and likewise\nhigh collagen density causes more cell accumulation as the cells slow down and continue\nto divide. This self-reinforcing feature can be seen in Fig. lb. We now consider the ways\nin which the collagen alignment is affected by varying key parameters in the model.\nInflux from surrounding tissue verses cell multiplication\nThe first parameter we vary is the cell cycle time. Due to the design of the model, this\naffects the way the cells enter the wound region. Recall that in the model the cells are\nintroduced into the domain from adjacent dermis and the subcutaneous fascia at a constant\nrate, and divide until a maximum number of cells in the wound region is reached Thus\nby increasing the cell cycle time, a smaller proportion of cells enter via multiplication\nrelative to migration. Similarly, by decreasing the cell cycle time the situation is reversed,\nwith more cell divisions occurring. Changes in how the cells enter the wound region have\na dramatic effect on the alignment and density patterns, as shown in Fig. 2. In (a), all\nthe cells enter the wound from the surrounding tissue (80 percent from the fascia) and in\npart (b), 60 cells enter initially from surrounding tissue with all the rest resulting from\ncell division. Both the alignment and density show dramatic differences. In (a) there is a\ndense and very aligned region of collagen at the base of the wound area, as is commonly\nseen in experiments, while in (b) the collagen is less aligned, with a dense region away\nfrom the base and extending up into the centre of the wound region. This suggests that\nfibroblasts entering the wound from surrounding tissue play a more important role in scar\ntissue formation than those which are introduced into the wound region by cell division.\nVariation in cell numbers\nHaving concluded that the way in which fibroblasts enter the wound region is important\nin collagen alignment, we next investigate how changes in the maximum number of cells\ninfluence the alignment The model allows for a maximum number of cells to exist in the\n0-5 mm x 1 mm wound region which, for our standard case, corresponding to experimental\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 385\n1.5\n0-2 CM f>6 0-8\nVertical dstancs (mm)\n(c)\n40 60\nTime (hours)\n(d)\nFlo. 1.

The cause of alignment is verified by reducing the influx from the\nfascia, while maintaining the higher cell maximum, which results in a more random pattern.\nWhen the maximum number of cells is decreased, there is less collagen produced and the\nalignment is reduced slightly due to fewer cells entering from the fascia.\nVariations in cell speed\nThe nature of the collagen alignment is strongly determined by the speed of the fibroblasts.\nIn Figs 4a and b the results of two simulations are shown where the cell speed is changed\nso that the average cell speed is first lower and then higher than the standard case (Fig. 1).\nThe simulation with low cell speed was run for a longer time (300 h) so that the degree\nof invasion is comparable with the standard case. It is clearly seen that with faster cell\nspeeds there is more alignment than with lower speeds. This is due to our assumption that\nhigher speeds cause the cells to move for longer runs before sampling their environment to\ndetermine a new direction.\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 387\n1.5\n.75\nPIG. 3. Collagen alignment and density for simulations which differ from Fig. 1 in the total number of cells. In\n(a) there is a maximum of 200 fibroblasts and in (b) there is a maximum of 1200 fibroblasts. The lower collagen\ndensity in (a) is due to fewer fibroblasts in the simulation. The orientation in (b) of the collagen is more aligned\nthan in (a) but not significantly more than in Fig. la. This indicates that total cell number is not significant in\naligning the collagen. The alignment is shown by drawing lines whose tangent corresponds to the collagen vector\nfield (the streamlines) with black representing high collagen density and white representing low collagen density.\n4. Model predictions for experimental interventions\nIn the previous section we investigated the model by examining the effects of changing\nvarious parameters. With a more fundamental understanding of the model, we now describe\nthe results from three simulations representing potential biological experiments whose\nresults would shed light on the healing process.\n\u2022 In the first simulated experiment, cells entering the wound directly from the\nsubcutaneous fascia are blocked (Fig. 4c). Comparison with Fig. 1 shows that the\ncollagen is not as strongly aligned in the vertical direction when the cells are blocked\nresulting in less scarring, but initial collagen deposition is slower (due to the lower\ncell densities). A simulation with roughly equal numbers of cells entering from each\nwound edge, results in collagen alignment patterns very similar to Fig. 4c, without the\nslower collagen buildup. When 80 percent of the fibroblasts enter at the fascia, vertical\nalignment is obtained; this'supports the conclusion of the previous section that the\nmanner in which the cells are introduced into the wound region is key in establishing\nalignment. The key difference in the blocked fascia simulation when compared with the\nstandard case, is the flux relative to the density of dividing cells. Our model assumes\nthat cell division disrupts fibroblast polarization and thus has a randomizing influence\non the alignment pattern. A lower flux of cells from the surrounding tissue allows more\ncell proliferation, causing less alignment.\nJ. DALLON ETAL.\n1.5\n.75\nFIG. 4. Collagen alignment and density for simulations where the fibroblasts' speeds are lower than normal (a)\nand higher than normal (b). In (c) a more random collagen alignment pattern develops in a simulation where the\ninflux of cells from the subcutaneous fascia is blocked but the cells' speeds are normal. The significant alignment\nin (b) when compared to (a) shows the importance of speed in aligning the collagen. In (a), v = 5 \/im\/h giving\nan average cell speed at t = 100 of 0-747 fun\/h and in (b) v = 30 \/im\/h giving an average cell speed at t = 100\nof 7-62 jim\/h. This can be compared with Fig. 1 where v = 30 \/im\/h with an average cell speed of 316 tim\/h.\nThe collagen in (a) is shown at t = 300 h, in (b) at \/ = 100 and in (c) at t = 200. The alignment is shown by\ndrawing lines whose tangent corresponds to the coUagen vector field (the streamlines) with black representing\nhigh collagen density and white representing low coUagen density. The model parameters are die same as those\nin Fig. 1 unless otherwise noted.\nOur model predicts that enhancing cell division (for example, by addition of a chemical\nmitogen throughout the wound and surrounding tissue) should cause less scarring.\nDecreasing the cell cycle time has a slight randomizing effect on collagen alignment\ndue to the loss of cell polarization that results from cell division. However, a more\nimportant effect is how the cell population in the wound region responds. If, as a\nresult of more cells dividing, fewer cells migrate into the region, there will be less\nalignment By suppressing cell division, the most important effect is again on the\ncell density. There will be a strong tendency to alignment if there is an increased cell\nflux; otherwise, the cell densities will be lower, the cell speeds will be faster and the\ntendency will again be to align. In the wound region, platelet-derived growth factor acts\nas a chemoattractant for fibroblasts, as well as promoting cell proliferation (Heldin &\nWestermark, 1996). Our model suggests that these are two factors which oppose each\nother in terms of aligning the collagen matrix, suggesting that this cytokine is not a key\nregulator of alignment.\nAltering the rates of production and degradation of collagen (which could be achieved,\nat least in vitro, by gene amplification) will obviously alter its density in the wound\nregion. Our model predicts that there is also an effect on collagen alignment, due to\nthe dependency of the cell speed on the protein densities. By altering the production\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 389\nand degradation terms, the local densities are changed, leading to altered speeds of\nfibroblast movement, and thus causing changes in alignment. If the collagen deposition\nis slower the average cell speed is faster causing greater alignment, and conversely, if\nthe collagen deposition is faster the average cell speed is slower causing less alignment\n5. Discussion\nOur model has indicated various phenomena at the cellular level that are important in\ncollagen alignment during wound repair. We begin the discussion by considering how these\nrelate to the new anti-scarring therapies currently being developed. Neutralizing antibody\nto TGF\/J has been suggested as a novel anti-scarring agent (Shah et aL, 1992). More\nrecently, it has been found that manipulating the concentrations of different isoforms of\nTGF\/5 has different effects (Shah et aL, 1995). These isoforms influence all phases of the\nhealing process, including complicated modifications to fibroblast behaviour. At least two\neffects on the fibroblasts are pertinent to this discussion. First, TGF^i induces fibroblasts\nto produce more collagen in fibrin gels and to a lesser degree in collagen gels (Clark et\naL, 1995). Second, although TGF\/?i act as a chemoattractant for fibroblasts, it can also\ninhibit migration into three-dimensional collagen gels (Roberts & Sporn, 1996). In the\ncontext of our model, altering the collagen production does not directly influence the\nmanner in which collagen is aligned, but it changes cell speed which affects alignment\nBecause TGF0 can act as a chemoattractant, our model predicts two possible causes\nfor different alignment modified cell flux into the wound region and changes in the\nspeed of the fibroblasts. Experimental results show that neutralizing TGF^i results in the\ninitial collagen deposition being decreased with only slightly improved scarring, whereas\nneutralizing both TGF\/3i and TGF\/?2 or adding TGF\/J3 causes less scarring. This is\nconsistent with our model's predictions, indicating that the primary reason for reduced\nscarring is not a direct result of the slower deposition of collagen (see Section 4). If\nneutralizing both TGF)3i and TGF^2 reduces the influx of cells from the fascia, our model\npredicts the observed results of less scarring and slower initial collagen deposition.\nThus, even in the extremely simplified caricature of tissue regeneration represented\nby our model, collagen alignment is clearly shown to be a multi-factorial process.\nThis is consistent with experimental evidence, and implies that therapeutic intervention\nmust address several separate causes of the altered alignment pattern. Most randomizing\nprocesses in the system, such as the random structure of the fibrin clot will, over time,\ntend to disrupt alignment in the absence of factors which tend to cause alignment These\nfactors include cell speed, flux, division and other secondary effects which influence these,\nsuch as collagen production rate. The most important alignment-producing features are\ncell speed and cell flux. By moving faster, our model fibroblasts receive contact guidance\ncues less frequently, causing them to travel in straighter paths and give the collagen greater\nalignment However, a more important feature for scar formation is the manner in which\nthe cells enter the wound region. Our model predicts that the fundamental reason for the\nstructural differences between scar and normal tissue is not the transition between fibrin\nand collagen matrices, or biochemical differences in the wound region, but simply the fact\nthat fibroblasts establish an alignment pattern as they migrate into the wound from the\nperiphery. This is highlighted by the results of a simulation where the maximum number\nof cells are uniformly placed in the fibrin clot rather than dividing or migrating in from the\n390 J. DALLON ETAL\nwound edges. This results in collagen patterns which are similar to that shown in Fig. 4c,\nwith randomly aligned collagen, more closely resembling the situation in normal skin.\nAs the fibroblasts flow into a wound from the surrounding tissue (predominantly from\nthe subcutaneous tissue), they generate collagen fiber patterns which are reinforced by\nsubsequent fibroblast migration. This is the basic process by which the matrix becomes\naligned and scar tissue forms.\nIn our modelling we have focused on the initial deposition of collagen. We believe that\nthis is the most important factor in determining alignment due to self-reinforcing processes.\nYet there are several elements which could be considered in future modelling work. Wound\ncontraction is an important process in wound healing and could reinforce initial collagen\nalignment The chemical regulation of the wound environment by growth factors is also a\nkey regulator of fibroblasts during wound repair. These are two elements which could have\nsignificant consequences for collagen alignment and there are many others which would\nprovide a more complete picture of wound healing.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by EPSRC grant GR\/K71394 and London Mathematical\nSociety, under scheme 3.

DALLON ETAL.\nAppendix\nHere we describe specific functions and parameters used for the standard simulation. Our\ndescription is deliberately brief and further mathematical details are published elsewhere\n(Dallon etaL, 1999; Dallon, 2000).\nSpeed function\nThe dependency of the speed on the protein densities is given by\nwhere v, e\\, ei, e^, q, g\\ and #2 are a positive constant The function is chosen so that\nthe first product is a decreasing function ranging from 1 at ||c|| = 0 to about 0-208 at\n||c|| = 1-5, and the second product is a linearly increasing function ranging from 0-33 to 1\nfor the values of || b ||. Thus the cell speed has a maximum value of v and a minimum value\nof about v\/9. The constants used in the simulations are c\\ = 1\/8, C2 = 7\/8, ej, = 3\/8,\nq = 6, g\\ = 2, gi = 3 and v = 30 unless stated otherwise.\nEquation for the weight function\nThe weight function from equation (4) is defined by\nw({> -x) = aia2 with a , = m a x ( l J-\u2014\u2014 , o l , (A.I)\nwhere f = ( \/ j , \/ j ) , x = (x\\,X2) and L = 10 \/xm. Thus a cell will influence the\nextracellular matrix which is in a 20 \/i.m square centered at the cell.\nThe numerical method\nThe equations are solved by discretizing the variables c and b in space and then solving\nthe ordinary differential equations at the appropriate grid points using Euler's method.\nThe cells are not constrained to the discretized grid and thus the grid variables must\nbe interpolated to the cell locations and the cell influence must be interpolated to the\ngrid locations. The first interpolation uses a standard tensor product piecewise quartic\ninterpolanL For the second interpolation we use a discretized version of w. The numerical\nalgorithm used to solve these equations consists of the following steps:\n(i) Interpolate the magnitude of the collagen and fibrin as well as the direction of the\ncollagen to the fibroblast locations.\n(ii) Interpolate the influence of the fibroblasts to the extracellular matrix.\n(iii)Detennine the fibroblasts direction (equation (3)) using an explicit Euler method.\n(iv) Solve the direction and magnitude of the collagen and the magnitude of the fibrin\n(equations (5), (6) and (7)) on a fixed grid using an explicit Euler method.\n(v) Move the fibroblasts to their new locations and decide whether they should divide.\nA MODEL OF COLLAGEN DEPOSITION IN WOUND REPAIR 393\nParameter values\nThe domain is taken to be 0-5 mm by 1 mm with the maximum number of fibroblasts\nM = 600, values which compare well with typical rodent slash wounds. The discretization\nused for the domain is a grid of 51 by 101 points and a time step of 015 h. The cell\ncycle time is 18 h and the base cell speed v = 150 \/zm\/h. These are standard values\nfor fibroblasts. The other parameter values represent qualities of the fibroblasts and are\ndifficult to determine or have not been measured experimentally. The time lag z = 015\n(9 min) hours was chosen since the cell moves at most 2-25 \/zm in this time interval and\nfor computational convenience. A range of values for K, which represents the effectiveness\nof the fibroblasts in reorienting the collagen, from 0 to 40 were tested in experiments. The\nvalue used for the simulations in this paper is <c = 5 0. The cell polarization parameter does\nnot dramatically affect the collagen alignment (see Section 3) and in all the simulations\nshown we take p = 0-9, reflecting the high degree of polarity in fibroblasts on fibrous gels.\nThe value for a is chosen to be 0-5 assuming that the fibrin clot and the collagen matrix\nwould equally influence the direction of the fibroblasts. Simulations show that our results\nare not sensitive to changes in this parameter. The production of collagen by fibroblasts is\nwell researched, but only in terms of ratios with respect to normal production. Typically the\nprotein is radioactively labelled and the results are measured in increments of several days.\nThis essentially gives at most two data points for the time interval which we are examining.\nThe values we use for the production and degradation of collagen and fibrin are pc = 0-64,\ndc = 0-44 and d\\, = 0-6, which are rough estimates giving an appropriate time course for\nthe production and degradation of the proteins.\n\n"}
