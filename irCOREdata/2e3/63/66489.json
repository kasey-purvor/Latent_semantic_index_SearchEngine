Parker and C.S. Adams\nDepartment of Physics, University of Durham, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom\nWe show that a \u2018weak\u2019 elliptical deformation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate rotating at\nclose to the quadrupole instability frequency leads to turbulence with a Kolmogorov energy spec-\ntrum. The turbulent state is produced by energy transfer to condensate fragments that are ejected\nby the quadrupole instability. This energy transfer is driven by breaking the two-fold rotational\nsymmetry of the condensate. Subsequently, vortex-sound interactions damp the turbulent state\nleading to the crystalization of a vortex lattice.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) turbulence has been explored in\ndiverse areas such as soap films [1], magnetohydroynam-\nics [2], and meteorology (see [3] and references therein),\nand can often display additional features not present in\n3D [4]. However, the complexities of real fluids mean\nthat the theoretical predictions are often at odds with\nobserved spectra. In this regard there may be some ad-\nvantages in studying superfluids where the absence of\nviscosity and the quantization of vorticity can simplify\nthe theoretical picture. For example, superfluid turbu-\nlence in liquid Helium [5] is found to exhibit analogous\nfeatures to classical turbulence, in particular a Kolomor-\ngorov energy spectrum [6]. Even more amenable to theo-\nretical description are atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs) [7]. In addition, atomic BECs allow the flexibility\nof studying the transition between 2D and 3D turbulence.\nRecent experiments on atomic BECs have generated\nvortex lattices by thermodynamically condensing a ro-\ntating thermal cloud [8] and mechanical rotation of the\ncondensate in an anharmonic trap [9, 10, 11]. In the lat-\nter case, a quadrupolar collective mode of the condensate\nis excited. A dynamical instability [12, 13] leads to the\nnucleation of vortices, which subsequently crystallise into\na lattice configuration. The time-scale for vortex lattice\nformation has been shown to be insensitive to tempera-\nture [11, 14], suggesting that the process is a purely dy-\nnamical effect. The formation of the lattice has been sim-\nulated using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaveskii equa-\ntion (GPE) in 2D with the inclusion of damping effects\n[15, 16], and in 3D [17]. However, questions remain over\nthe dynamics involved, for example, how the dynamical\ninstability seeds vortex nucleation, what is the damping\nmechanism leading to the crystallization of the lattice,\nand the role of dimensionality in the process.\nIn this paper, we present evidence that 2D turbulence\nis a key feature of current experiments on vortex lattice\nformation in atomic BECs. In particular we show that\nthe route to lattice formation can be divided into four\ndistinct stages, as illustrated in Fig. 1. These stages are:\n- Fragmentation: The quadrupolar mode breaks down,\nejecting energetic atoms to form an outer cloud.\n- Symmetry-breaking: The two-fold rotational sym-\nmetry of the system is broken in a macroscopic man-\nner, allowing the rotation to couple to additional modes,\nthereby injecting energy rapidly into the system.\n- Turbulence: A turbulent cloud containing vortices\n0 10000 20000 30000\nt (\u03be\/c)\n0\n100\n200\n300\nE \n(\u00b5)\nFragm\nentat\nion\nTurbu\nlence\nCryst\nallisa\ntion\nSymm\netry b\nreakin\ng\nFIG. 1: The condensate energy (black line) and energy of\nthe outer cloud (dashed line), defined as the region with n <\n0.2n0, as a function of time, with a trap rotation frequency\n\u2126 = 0.77\u03c9r . The four distinct stages of the evolution (see\ntext) are indicated.\nand high energy density fluctuations (sound field) is\nformed, with a Kolmogorov energy spectrum.\n- Crystallisation: The loss of energy at short length-\nscales coupled with the vortex-sound interactions [18, 19]\nallow the system to relax into an ordered lattice.\nOur analysis is based on the classical field method\nwhereby the GPE is used to describe both the conden-\nsate mean-field \u03c8 and fluctuations [20]. Fluctuations in\nthe initial state speed-up the evolution through the four\nstages but do not change the qualitative behaviour. For\nillustrative purposes we use an initial state without ex-\ncitations. The rotating trap strongly polarizes the dy-\nnamics along the z-axis, such that 2D dynamics in the\nrotating plane dominate the system. Indeed we have ver-\nified that the same results are obtained in the flattened,\nquasi-2D geometry by solving the 3D GPE. We there-\nfore proceed in the 2D limit by solving the computation-\nally advantageous 2D GPE, as in our previous work [18].\nWe have performed simulations for a range of condensate\nsizes, and various grid and box sizes, and find the same\nqualitative results throughout. We characterise the state\nof the system in terms of the energy, which is calculated\nusing the time-independent GPE energy functional,\nE =\n\u222b [\n\u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2m\n|\u2207\u03c8|2 + Vext\u03c82 + g\n2\n|\u03c8|4\n]\ndxdy, (1)\nand subtract the corresponding energy of the initial state.\n2Here Vext is the external potential, m is the atomic mass,\nand g = 4pih\u00af2Na\/m, where N is the number of atoms\nand a is the s-wave scattering length.\nTo apply a rotation we use a \u2018weakly\u2019 elliptical poten-\ntial similar to the experiments [9, 11] (the stirring po-\ntential used in Ref. [10] is strongly anharmonic). The\npotential can be expressed as,\nVext(x, y, t) =\n1\n2\nm\u03c92r\n[\n(x2 + y2) + \u03b5\n(\nX2 \u2212 Y 2)] . (2)\nThe first term represents the static harmonic trap with\ntransverse frequency \u03c9r. In the second term, the pa-\nrameter \u03b5 characterises the trap anisotropy in the co-\nordinate system (X,Y ) which is aligned with the static\n(x, y) coordinates at t = 0 and subsequently rotates at\nangular frequency \u2126. We employ a trap deformation of\n\u03b5 = 0.025 [9]. Whereas previous theoretical investiga-\ntions have considered the rotating frame [15, 16, 17], we\nperform simulations in the laboratory frame.\nOur units of length, time and energy are the healing\nlength \u03be = h\u00af\/\n\u221a\nm\u00b5, (\u03be\/c), and the chemical potential \u00b5\u2212\nn0g. Here c =\n\u221a\n\u00b5\/m is the Bogoliubov speed of sound,\n\u00b5 = n0g is the chemical potential and n0 is the peak\ncondensate density. Using typical parameters for a 87Rb\ncondensate, the units of distance and time correspond to\n\u03be \u223c 0.3 \u00b5m and (\u03be\/c) \u223c 10\u22124s, respectively.\nFragmentation: At t = 0, the rotation is turned on.\nThe rotating trap couples energy into the condensate by\nexciting a quadrupolar shape oscillation, while the axes\nof the quadrupole rotate at the trap rotation frequency\n\u2126. This excitation mimics rotation yet the system re-\nmains irrotational. In the radially-symmetric system,\nthe quadrupole mode is predicted to have a resonant fre-\nquency at \u2126 = \u03c9r\/\n\u221a\n2 [21], but this is shifted slightly\nby the ellipticity. Away from the resonant frequency, the\nquadrupole oscillations have reduced amplitude and are\nstable. The condensate cycles between the initial circu-\nlar state and a higher energy elongated state, but over a\ncomplete cycle there is no net increase in energy. Such\nquadrupole oscillations have been observed experimen-\ntally [22].\nThe condensate is predicted to be dynamically unsta-\nble at the quadrupole resonant frequency [13]. The insta-\nbility arises because the amplitude of the mode becomes\nso large that the quadrupolar irrotational flow can no\nlonger be supported. As the condensate relaxes from the\npoint of maximum elongation, the fluid cannot adjust\nsufficiently quickly back towards the centre of trap. This\nresults in the shedding of fluid from the ends of the con-\ndensate forming low density tails and giving the conden-\nsate a spiral shape (Fig. 2(a)(ii)). The ejected material\ncollapses back onto the condensate edge, forming phase\ndislocations with the main condensate. This generates\nsurface waves and \u2018ghost\u2019 vortices [15]. An outer, low\ndensity (\u223c 0.1n0) cloud is formed (Fig. 2(a)(iii)). After\nthe condensate has shed material (Fig. 2(b), solid line)\nits energy no longer decreases back to the inital value\n- energy has been transferred irreversibly into the con-\ni ii iii iv(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 2: Fragmentation: (a) Snapshots of the condensate den-\nsity in the range (0 \u2212 0.05n0) at times t \u2248 (i) 400, (ii) 800,\n(iii) 1200, and (iv) 6000 (\u03be\/c).

We monitor the relative evolution of the outer,\nlow density cloud and the inner, high density conden-\nsate by defining the outer cloud to be where the den-\nsity is less than a certain value, taken here to be 0.2n0.\nThe injected energy goes primarily into the outer cloud\n(Fig. 2(b), dashed line). Note that, although the energy\nof the inner and outer clouds are comparable, the outer\ncloud contains only around 10% of the total atoms, and\ntherefore the average energy per atom is considerably\nhigher. Subsequently, the inner cloud continues to un-\ndergo quadrupole oscillations and eject small fragments,\nas indicated by the energy curves shown in Fig. 2(b).\nAlso, the outer cloud develops more structure at short\nlength-scales (Fig. 2(a)(iv)).\nFor the parameters employed here, we observe the frag-\nmentation of the cloud (and ultimately the formation of\na vortex lattice) for rotation frequencies in the range\n0.72 < \u2126\/\u03c9r < 0.78, which is in reasonable agreement\nwith the experimental results of Madison et al. [9]. Out-\nside this range the quadrupole mode is stable, and the\nwidth of the unstable region increases with the trap el-\nlipticity \u03b5, which is consistent with the experimental ob-\nservations of Hodby et al. [11].\nSymmetry breaking: The condensate and potential\nhave a two-fold rotational symmetry, which is clearly vis-\nible in Fig. 2(a). In the experiments [9, 11] this symmetry\nis absent. Eventually in the simulations, an asymmetry\ngrows out of the numerical noise generated by modelling\na rotation using a static square grid. We characterise this\nasymmetry in terms of an asymmetry parameter defined\nas,\n\u03c3 =\n\u222b [|\u03c8 (x, y) |2 \u2212 |\u03c8 (\u2212x,\u2212y) |2]dxdy\u222b |\u03c8 (x, y) |2dxdy .

When it reaches macroscopic\nlevels (\u03c3 \u223c 0.1) we enter a symmetry-breaking phase at\nt \u223c 8000 (\u03be\/c). From then on, additional modes can\nbe excited, and energy is rapidly coupled into the sys-\ntem (Fig. 3(a), solid line). This energy predominantly\nexcites the outer, low density cloud, as shown in Fig. 1\n(dashed line). The condensate density and phase during\nthis stage are shown in Fig. 3(c)-(d). The original two-\nfold rotational symmetry is now clearly broken. Towards\nthe end of this stage the outer cloud strongly couples to,\nand merges with, the inner condensate. Energy and an-\ngular momentum become transferred to the inner cloud,\nthe quadrupole mode finally breaks down, and vortices\nbecome nucleated in the higher density regions.\nIn experiments, symmetry-breaking will occur due to,\nfor example, the thermal cloud, quantum fluctuations,\ntrap imperfections, and fluctuating fields. We model the\neffect by allowing the trap centre to randomly jump, or\njitter, within a region [\u2212\u03b3,+\u03b3]\u00d7 [\u2212\u03b3,+\u03b3]. Fig. 3(a)-(b)\nshow the results for trap jitters of \u03b3 = 0.0001 (dashed\nline) and 0.1 (dotted line). We observe the same qual-\nitative behaviour as in the absence of the jitter, al-\nthough the macroscopic symmetry-breaking occurs ear-\nlier when jitter is added. Even for an extremely small jit-\nter (\u03b3 = 0.0001\u03be, 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the\ngrid size) the effect is significant, thereby demonstrating\nthe importance of symmetry. Symmetry-breaking allows\nvortices to enter the condensate one by one, rather than\nin opposing pairs [15] which reduces the threshold energy\nfor vortex nucleation.\nTurbulence: Following the injection of energy into the\ncondensate during the symmetry-breaking stage, a highly\nexcited and energetic condensate containing randomly-\npositioned vortices is formed, as shown in Fig. 4(a)-(b).\nWe analyse this stage of the evolution by calculating the\nenergy spectrum, shown in Fig. 4(c). During the tur-\nbulent phase the system closely follows a Kolmogorov\n(c)(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 4: Turbulence: Snapshots of the turbulent (a) conden-\nsate density and (b) phase at t = 11000 (\u03be\/c).

Such\nbehaviour is a key signature of classical turbulence and\nalso occurs in models of superfluid turbulence [6]. The\ndeparture from a k\u22125\/3\u2212law occurs at an upper bound of\nk \u2248 2(2pi\/\u03be), corresponding to the characteristic length-\nscale of vortex-sound interactions [19], and a lower bound\nof k \u2248 0.3(2pi\/\u03be), corresponding to the size of the con-\ndensate. An additional feature of 2D classical turbulence\nis that the spectrum is predicted to show k\u22123 behaviour\nfollowing the k\u22125\/3 region [4]. However, we observe a\nk\u22126 dependence in this range. The power spectrum in\nthe fragmentation stage (Fig. 4(a), intermediate grey)\nand the succeeding crystallisation stage (Fig. 4(a), light\ngrey) do not show a k\u22125\/3 behaviour.\nCrystallisation: The turbulent state contains a dense\nsound field and vortices. In previous work we have shown\nhow vortices can both radiate and absorb sound waves\nin a Bose-Einstein condensate [18, 19]. We propose\nthat this vortex-sound interaction enables the randomly-\npositioned vortices in our rotating condensate to crys-\ntallise into a lattice.\nTo demonstrate the transfer of energy from the sound\nfield (density fluctuations) to the vortices, we divide the\nenergy into a component due to the vortices EV and\na component due to the sound field ES. We approxi-\nmate EV at a particular time by numerically generating\na similar condensate (by propagating the GPE in imagi-\nnary time) with the same vortex distribution but without\nsound. The sound energy is then defined as ES = E\u2212EV.\nDuring the fragmentation, symmetry breaking and tur-\nbulent stages, both sound energy (Fig. 5(a), dotted line)\nand vortex energy (Fig. 5(a), dashed line) are fed into\nthe system. At the start of the crystallisation phase the\nsound energy is considerably higher than the vortex en-\nergy. However as time progresses the sound energy de-\ncreases with this energy being transferred to the vortices.\nFigs. 5(b)-(c) shows the condensate density at the begin-\n40 50000 100000\nt (\u03be\/c)\n0\n100\n200\nE \n(\u00b5)\n(i)\n(ii)\n(a) (b)\n(c)\ni ii\ni ii\nFIG. 5: Crystallisation: (a) Total condensate energy (solid\nline), sound energy (dotted line) and vortex energy (dashed\nline). Snapshots of the (a) total condensate density (0\u2212 n0)\nand (b) low density (0 \u2212 0.05n0) at times (i) 20000 and (ii)\n100000 (\u03be\/c).\nning and towards the end of the crystallisation phase.\nWe see that the conversion of sound energy into vor-\ntex energy is associated with the ordering of the vortices\nfrom a disordered distribution to a lattice configuration\nand a smoothing of the condensate profile (Fig. 5(b)).\nFurthermore, the outer cloud shrinks (Fig.5(c)). By the\ntime t = 100000 (\u03be\/c) the vortex energy is substantially\ngreater than the sound energy. At this point we observe\na well-ordered vortex lattice.\nIn our simulations, the finite grid size sets a maximum\nvalue in momentum space, with higher k modes having\nzero occupation [20]. We have imposed reduced values\nof the momentum cutoff and consistently observe lattice\nformation, with no marked effect on its timescale. This\nfurther supports the idea that the vortex lattice forma-\ntion is independent of thermal effects.\nIn the vortex lattice experiments [9, 11], the lattices\nare observed after up to 1s of trap rotation. In our simu-\nlation, a noisy lattice has formed by t \u223c 2s (Fig. 5(b,i)),\nwhile it takes several more seconds for the vortices to\nsettle into a clean lattice. However, as shown in Fig. 3,\nthe timescale of the fragmentation stage is sensitive to\nthe degree of symmetry-breaking effects present in the\nsystem, as well as the trap rotation frequency and ellip-\nticity. One would therefore expect that in a real system,\nwith all its inherent imperfections, the timescale for this\nstage will be reduced.\nNote that if the rotation is terminated before the peak\nenergy has been coupled into the system, the lattice still\nforms, albeit at a lower energy. This allows control over\nthe number of vortices which ultimately form in the lat-\ntice.\nIn summary, we have shown that \u2018stirring\u2019 atomic con-\ndensates generates turbulence. We verify that a k\u22125\/3\npower law is observed for two-dimensional superfluid tur-\nbulence. The turbulent state subsequently evolves into a\nvortex lattice by vortex-sound interactions. Future work\nwill focus on turbulence in spinor systems and the effect\nof dimensionality on the turbulence spectrum.\nWe acknowledge UK EPSRC for funding and S. A.\nGardiner for discussions.\n[1] Y.
