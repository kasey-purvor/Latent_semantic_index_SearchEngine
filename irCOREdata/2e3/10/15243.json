INTRODUCTION\nSome time ago Pendry et al.1,2 considered the problem of\nthe plasma frequency of an array of thin metallic wires,\nwhich is a structure whose low frequency response can be\ncharacterized in terms of an effective plasma frequency, be-\nlow which propagating electromagnetic modes do not occur.\nIn their case the theory was specifically designed to deal with\nvery thin wires with an effective plasma frequency shifted\ninto the GHz range from the bulk metal value \u00031015 Hz.\nSince then a number of alternative simple analytic theories\nhave been proposed in order to deal with this problem.3\u20135 In\nthe current work we apply a frequency dependent, plane-\nwave based, complex photonic band structure approach to\nthe calculation of the effective plasma frequency for a series\nof structures consisting of an array of circular metal rods in a\ntwo-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 square lattice. The plane-wave ap-\nproach is potentially applicable to a variety of situations in\nwhich the permittivity depends on frequency. There has been\nconsiderable controversy concerning the results to be ex-\npected in the case of much lower frequencies and rather\nlarger lattice spacings where the skin depth and rod diameter\nare comparable \u0001see for example Markos and Soukoulis6 and\nreferences therein\u0002. However, in our calculations, we are\nconcerned with the case where the skin depth is significantly\nsmaller than the rod diameter, and therefore some of the\nproblems encountered at lower frequencies do not apply. The\ndetails of the theory are described in Sec. II with the results\npresented in Sec. III. Comparison with existing analytic\ntheories for the effective plasma frequency are found in Sec.\nIV and conclusions in Sec. V.\nII. THEORY\nThe theory described follows a similar formulation to that\nof our earlier work concerning complex electronic band\nstructure,7 and recent complex photonic band structure stud-\nies of equifrequency surfaces for superprism applications8\ncarried out within our group. The approach is similar to, but\ndifferent in some details to that described by Gu et al.9 We\nbegin by assuming a system with frequency-independent\nbackground relative permittivity \u0002b into which we introduce\na 2D periodic array of rods of arbitrary cross section aligned\nparallel to the z direction, as shown in Fig. 1. The relative\npermittivity within the rods is taken to be of the general\nfrequency-dependent form \u0002\u0001\u0003\u0002 which may have real and\nimaginary components that completely characterize the re-\nsponse of the rods. For completeness we consider the situa-\ntions in which the electric field is polarized either parallel\n\u0001TM\u0002 or perpendicular \u0001TE\u0002 to the rods although it is the\nformer case with which we are primarily concerned. In what\nfollows we consider only nonmagnetic materials for which\nthe permeability is \u00040.\nA.

RESULTS\nWe now apply the theory described in Sec. II to the situ-\nation in which we have a 2D square array of circular metal\nrods of diameter 2r and lattice constant a=200 \u0004m. A set of\nstructures is considered with a range of rod diameters from\n10\u2013120 \u0004m. The lattice period of 200 \u0004m is similar, al-\nthough somewhat smaller, to that employed in the experi-\nmental work of Pimenov and Loidl14 who considered 2D\narrays of copper and steel wires. The values of r and the\nperiod have been chosen to ensure an effective plasma fre-\nquency in the THz regime. This is a regime which is acces-\nsible to fabrication employing standard lithographic and\nsputtering techniques.\nFor the purposes of the calculation we take the back-\nground relative permittivity \u0002b=1 as appropriate for air and\nfor the circular rods we take\n\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0002 = 1 \u2212\n\u0003p\n2\n\u0003\u0001\u0003 + i\u0003c\u0002\n, \u000116\u0002\nwhere \u0003p is the bulk metal plasma frequency and \u0003c is a\nconstant describing the absorption. In this case we employ\nthe values of Ordal et al.15 for gold: \u0003p=2\u0007\u00062.175\n\u00061015 s\u22121, \u0003c=2\u0007\u00066.5\u00061012 s\u22121.\nTo begin, we present typical complex photonic band\nstructure results for the TM case, both excluding and includ-\ning the absorption term in Eq. \u000116\u0002. These are shown in Figs.\n2 and 3, respectively. \u0001In the figures it should be noted that\nthere is no special significance to the sign of the real and\nimaginary k components: the k values come in pairs with\npositive and negative imaginary components corresponding\nto decay in opposite directions. The sign convention em-\nployed here is purely for plotting convenience.\u0002 These par-\nticular calculations were performed with the wave vector in\nthe \u0007100\b direction for midrange 50 micron diameter rods\nand employed 805 plane waves for the expansion of the E\nfield. In the plots, k is given in units of 2\u0007 \/a and the results\nin Fig. 2 indicate that the main purely imaginary solutions\nare heavily attenuated; indeed Im\u0001k\u0002\r0.15\u00062\u0007 \/a, corre-\nsponding to the center of the general complex solution cen-\ntred at about 1 THz implies a decay length for E of about 1\nlattice constant. Note that for these general complex wave\nvectors, the real part of k is attached to the edge of the\nBrillouin zone and solutions with Re\u0001k\u0002= \u00b10.5\u00062\u0007 \/a are\nequivalent as they differ by a reciprocal lattice vector. In the\nrange displayed, the results indicate that there are two bands\nin which propagation is possible between about 0.67\n\u21920.84 THz and 1.16\u21921.53 THz: in these regions the value\nof k is purely real. Note that when solutions are purely real or\npurely imaginary, as in this case, there is no energy dissipa-\ntion and we would conclude that any electromagnetic \u0001EM\u0002\nwave impinging on a semi-infinite system would be either\n100% reflected, if the imaginary component of k is nonzero,\nor may propagate to some extent through the structure, de-\npending on the reflection coefficient at the surface, if k is\npurely real.\nWe now consider the effect of the inclusion of the absorp-\ntion term \u0003c as demonstrated by the results in Fig. 3. In this\ncase all k are of general complex form, and hence a degree of\nenergy dissipation is always present, as we would expect for\na metal, although the respective real or imaginary compo-\nnents may be very small. We see that there is no qualitative\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Complex photonic band structure in the\n\u0007100\b direction for 50 micron diameter rods in a 200 micron period\nsquare lattice.

This region indicates the\nexistence of both positive, negative, and infinite group ve-\nlocities, although the interpretation of this is somewhat open\nto question since we have energy dissipation and such\nheavily attenuated solutions. Although it is clearly more\nproblematic to define the band edge in this case, the rela-\ntively small value of the imaginary component of k, corre-\nsponding to the general area of our original pass bands, in-\ndicates that for any finite structure significant propagation\nmay still be possible in the same ranges as indicated by our\noriginal calculations without the \u0003c term. In view of this we\nshall for the moment follow the widespread convention of\nneglecting the \u0003c term, and in what follows define the band\nedges as the frequencies at which k changes from purely\nimaginary to purely real or vice versa.\nWith the neglect of \u0003c, we show in Fig. 4 the evolution of\nthe pass bands \u0001purely real k regions\u0002 as a function of rod\ndiameter. The positions of the band edges have been estab-\nlished using 877 plane waves, which our calculations indi-\ncate give convergence to about 2% for the lowest frequency\nsolutions in which we are primarily interested. A significant\nfeature of the first two bands displayed is that, despite an\norder of magnitude change in rod diameter, and a much\nlarger change in fill factor, the change in position of the\nbands is relatively modest, especially in the case of band 2,\nthe center of which only shifts from about\n1.2 THz to 1.7 THz as rod diameter is increased from\n10 to 100 \u0004m. The center of band 1 shifts by a factor of\nabout 2 over the same range. In addition we note a consistent\nnarrowing of both bands with increasing diameter. We note\nthat the existence of such pass and stop band regions, which\ncan be modified in width and position by varying period and\nrod diameter, is potentially useful in THz filter applications.\nExperiments are currently being conducted by other workers\nin Durham in an attempt to establish the reliability of our\ntheoretical predictions concerning the detailed form of the\npass and stop bands for the above series of 200 \u0004m period\nstructures.\nIn principle, to simulate fully the effects of absorption\nwithin the metal rods when the absorption term is included,\nwe might expect that it would be necessary to represent the\ndetailed form of the E field within the skin depth region near\nthe surface of the rods. For the frequencies considered the\nskin depth is a small fraction of a micrometer and it is well\nbeyond the capabilities of our calculations to represent the E\nfield profile accurately with the number of plane waves em-\nployed. In practice it is clear from our calculations that\nwhereas the convergence of the value of the imaginary com-\nponent is in fact rather poorer than, for example, the position\nof the band edges, it can nevertheless still provide some in-\nformation concerning at least the minimum decay length\nwithin the structure \u0007the trend in the value of Im\u0001k\u0002 in the\n\u201cpass band\u201d regions is to decrease with increasing number of\nplane waves\b. In the case of the 10 \u0004m diameter rods, the\nindicated E field decay length appears to be in excess of 75\nperiods and, at least for fairly low diameter rods, the decay\nlength is roughly proportional to rod diameter and hence\narea. Even for 50 \u0004m diameter rods, the decay length is\nindicated to be in excess of 15 periods. Tests indicate that the\ndecay lengths are not greatly changed even with a signifi-\ncantly increased value of \u0003c, particularly for the second pass\nband, so we would confidently expect to observe substantial\ntransmission through finite structures. For the large diameter\nrods, e.g. \r100 \u0004m or similar, the convergence of the imagi-\nnary component of k is significantly worse and the losses\nappear to be rather high, suggesting that the narrower pass\nbands indicated in the absorption-free calculations may not\nbe achievable in practice.\nIV. EFFECTIVE PLASMA FREQUENCY\nIn addition to the more detailed results concerning the\ngeneral form of the photonic band structure, we can also\nmake use of the results in Fig. 4 to define an effective plasma\nfrequency, or cut-off frequency, for this series of structures.\nThis is the lowest frequency at which propagation is allowed\nthrough the structure when k first becomes purely real with\nincreasing frequency at the bottom of the first pass band.\nThis value is plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of rod diameter.\nTo give an indication of the possible consequences of con-\nvergence errors we also display a line in which the calculated\nvalues have been reduced by 2%.

In the case of\nPendry et al.2 the theoretical model was designed to apply to\nthin wire structures and the prototype system consisted of a\n2 \u0004m diameter wire in a 5 mm period square lattice. Simi-\nlarly, the Tretyakov expression is stated as being valid with\nr\ta \/100. In the case of the large diameter rods considered\nin the present work the band structure effects cannot be dis-\ncounted, the thin wire assumptions clearly do not apply, and\nhence our calculations represent an important independent\nindicator of the range of validity of these simpler models. In\ncomparing our results with those of the Pendry et al. model\nwe might initially conclude that their model is rather poor.\nHowever, given that the model was originally devised explic-\nitly for the case of very thin wires it may be more appropriate\nto conclude that it is surprisingly good under the circum-\nstances. The Tretyakov results are in reasonable agreement\nfor the smaller rod diameters \u0001although still at much greater\ndiameters than the suggested range of validity\u0002 but become\nmuch higher than our results for larger diameters. The results\nof both Sarychev and Shalaev and Maslovski are in quite\ngood agreement with the present work, although on balance\nthose of Maslovski, appear to be superior, particularly at the\nhigher rod diameters. We note that the plane-wave calcula-\ntions cannot be expected to perform well at very small rod\ndiameters, and indeed below about 10 \u0004m they appear some-\nwhat erratic due to the limited number of plane waves em-\nployed in the calculation, which is insufficient to define the\nstructure reliably in such cases. Although the results them-\nselves are not reliable in the small diameter regime, we note\nthat at very small diameters the plane-wave calculations give\nnumerical results which are consistent with a simple effec-\ntive medium model with the results agreeing almost exactly\nwith the expression \bp,ef f\n2\n=\nf\u0003p2\n4\u00072 = f\bp2 where f is the metallic\nfill factor.\nWithout the \u0003c absorption term the calculations involve\nno energy dissipation and the plane-wave calculation in ef-\nfect attempts to exclude the E field from the metallic regions\nwithin the limitations imposed by the finite number of plane\nwaves used. In this case the convergence of the results ap-\npears to be good, as already discussed. The method also\ngives results in agreement with the work of Kuzmiak et al.16\nwhen applied to structures in which the effective plasma fre-\nquency is much closer to the bulk value i.e. in the regime\nwhere the lattice constant is near the bulk plasma frequency\nwavelength in free space. The method of Kuzmiak et al. is\nessentially a modified standard plane-wave approach de-\nsigned to take advantage of the specific form of the permit-\ntivity expression \u0002\u0001\u0003\u0002=1\u2212\u0003p\n2 \/\u00032, but does not work in more\ngeneral frequency-dependent cases. Due to the relatively low\nvalue of the effective plasma frequency in our structures,\nwhich is well removed from the bulk value, we have also\nperformed standard plane wave photonic band structure cal-\nculations employing a large and constant negative value for\n\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0002, as this may be considered likely to give reasonable\nresults in this regime. However, we find that although it is\npossible to identify bands of the same form as those in the\ncurrent calculations, the convergence is significantly worse\nand we believe this more than justifies the use of the 2n\n\u00062n matrices required for the complex band structure cal-\nculations. Given that in our calculations the fields are prima-\nrily confined to the \u201cbackground\u201d regions with very little\npenetration into the metal rods, the explicit separation of\n\u0002\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002 or 1\/\u0002\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002 into background plus rod regions, rather than\nusing a single Fourier expansion can be expected to have\nbeen an aid to convergence: this is unlike the other\nformulations9,11\u201313 which do not employ such a separation\nand thus require a completely different Fourier expansion at\neach \u0003. We simply have the same Fourier expansion but a\ndifferent F1\u0001\u0003\u0002 or F2\u0001\u0003\u0002.\nAs an additional test of the plane-wave approach, we have\ncarried out calculations to obtain results for the experimental\nstructures studied by Pimenov and Loidl14 and observe that\nthe positions of the calculated bands appear to be entirely\nconsistent with their transmission results.\nIn practice, the concept of an effective plasma frequency\nin such periodic structures applies only to the TM polariza-\ntion for which we have presented detailed results. In this case\nthe system basically behaves as a standard waveguide struc-\nture with the results controlled by the boundary condition at\nthe surface of the rods which effectively means that E\u21920\nwithin the rods very close to the surface. The detailed behav-\nior within the skin depth region is generally not important for\nthe general form of the photonic band structure.

In particular, there is no effective plasma or cut-\noff frequency for this polarization.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have employed a theoretical formalism for computing\nthe plane-wave complex photonic band structure of a system\ncontaining components having a general frequency-\ndependent permittivity. In the regime considered this has sig-\nnificantly better convergence properties than a standard\nplane-wave calculation employing a large constant negative\nvalue for \u0002, which is an otherwise fairly reasonable approach\nto take. In applying the formalism to the calculation of the\nphotonic band structure of a square array of metal rods, we\nobtain a well-converged band structure displaying a charac-\nteristic series of pass bands and a cut-off or effective plasma\nfrequency in the THz region in the case of 200 \u0004m period\nstructures. Experimental work by others in Durham is cur-\nrently underway in an attempt to verify our theoretical pre-\ndictions for the detailed band structures. Although we nomi-\nnally considered gold rods in our calculations, the results are\nexpected to be essentially identical for any metallic rod\nstructure with similar rod diameter and period and typical\nbulk plasma frequency. The THz region considered is suffi-\nciently far from the bulk plasma frequency that the precise\nvalue of \u0003p is not important in determining the detailed nu-\nmerical results. In comparing the results for our calculated\neffective plasma frequency with those of simpler analytic\nmodels which do not account for the detailed band structure\neffects, and therefore whose range of validity is uncertain,\nwe conclude that the model of Maslovski4 appears to be most\nconsistent with our results over the range considered. We\nanticipate that the THz region pass bands displayed in our\nresults may be utilisable in THz filter applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nM.A.K. acknowledges the financial assistance of EPSRC\nvia Grant No EP\/C534263.\n1 J.
