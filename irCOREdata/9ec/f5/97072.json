Subsequent investigations have shown\nthat this characteristic, known as aerobic glycolysis, may play a critical role in the\ntransition from benign to malignant growth [8,23,24]. A key factor in the adoption of\naerobic glycolysis by tumour cell populations is their exposure to an unstable microen-\nvironment, experiencing oscillations in substrate supply. For example, normoxic\u2013\nhypoxic cycles in tumours have been measured to occur with periodicities of\nminutes [14], hours [12] and days [9]. From a bioenergetic perspective, those cells in\nwhich aerobic glycolysis is constitutively upregulated will be better placed to respond\nto these periods of hypoxia, and thus positively selected by somatic evolutionary pres-\nsures.\nUsing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is sensitive to oxy-\ngen levels, oscillations in signal intensity (oxygenation) have been shown to occur\nwith periodicities of both one and twenty cycles per hour [1]. Contrastingly, using\nmicroelectrodes, oxygenation cycles have been measured with periodicities of 1\u20132\nper min [2]. These discrepancies may be explained because MRI is relatively insensi-\ntive to rapid fluctuations, whilst instabilities in microelectrodes mean this modality is\ninsensitive to slower changes [8].\nEach of the studies mentioned above shows that tumour cells experience consid-\nerable changes in oxygen delivery. The primary explanation put forward for transient\nhypoxia and reoxygenation is oscillations in the h\u00e6modynamics, or blood delivery,\nof nearby and distant vessels [8,13]. Rapid normoxic\u2013hypoxic cycles are thought to\noccur due to fluctuations in haematocrit, the concentration of red cells in the blood [5],\nor through vasomotion, rhythmic oscillations in vessel diameter [25]. Longer cycles,\noccurring over days, are likely to be due to vascular remodelling, the active process\nof altering the structure and arrangement of blood vessels [13,19]. Vascular remod-\nelling is driven by cycles of angiogenesis promoted by hypoxia-induced expression of\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an induction and survival factor for new\nblood vessels [9].\nIn this paper, we examine an alternative mechanism for the observed substrate\noscillations in tumour tissue, namely cellular quiescence. High levels of acidity can\ninduce cells to cease proliferation, i.e. become quiescent [4]. Specifically, acidosis pro-\nmotes the production of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1); via a cyclin-dependent\nkinase inhibitor, p27, HIF-1 acts to inhibit the cell-cycle [10,18]. Quiescent cells are\nessentially metabolically inactive, producing significantly less acid than their prolif-\nerating counterparts. Thus the level of acidity will decrease, allowing cells to resume\nproliferation. We demonstrate that this simple feedback mechanism may produce the\nobserved cycles in tumour substrate levels. Whilst our focus is on growth inhibitors\nproduced by tumour tissue, such as lactic acid, the analysis is equally valid for growth\npromoters consumed by tumour tissue, such as oxygen.\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 769\n2 Model development\nWe model the tumour as a sphere of radius RM and assume that spherical symmetry\nprevails at all times. We consider first the dynamics of acidity in and around the tumour,\nthough later we shall show that the analysis holds for the dynamics of other substrates,\nsuch as oxygen.\nLet H denote the extracellular concentration of excess hydrogen ions, where excess\nmeans above its normal level of 10\u22127.25M \u2261 pH 7.25. We assume that there exists a\nsharp acidity threshold HQ above which tumour cells cease proliferation. Define the\nacid production rate rH = \u03c6Q per unit volume for quiescent cells and rH = \u03c6A for\nactive cells, where \u03c6Q \u0002 \u03c6A as quiescent cells are relatively inactive. The vascular\ndensity is taken to be V = VM within the tumour, and V = VN elsewhere. We allow\nfor a lag time t0 between extracellular acid levels changing, and cells mounting the\nappropriate response of quiescence or proliferation. Under these assumptions, we have\n\u2202 H\n\u2202t\n\u2212 DH\u22072 H := Ht \u2212 DH (HR R + 2HR\/R)\n=\n{[\n(\u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6Q)\u03b8(HQ \u2212 H(t \u2212 t0)) + \u03c6Q\n]\nKM \u2212 rV VM H 0 < R < RM\n\u2212rV VN H RM < R,\n(1)\nwhere KM denotes the tumour cell density, rV the acid removal rate, DH the acid\ndiffusion coefficient and \u03b8 the Heaviside (or unit step) function defined by\n\u03b8(x) =\n{\n0 x < 0\n1 x \u2265 0. (2)\nThe bracketed term in the second line of Eq. (1) simply represents cells producing\nacid at rate \u03c6A if H(t \u2212 t0) < HQ , and \u03c6Q otherwise.\nTaking p = \u221arV VM\/DH , H0 = \u03c6A KM\/rV VM and T = (rV VM )\u22121, and provided\nthe vascular density within the tumour is non-zero (i.e. VM > 0), we may non-\ndimensionalize Eq. (1) with r = pR, h = H\/H0 and \u03c4 = t\/T to obtain\nh\u03c4 \u2212 (hrr + 2hr\/r) =\n{\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40)) + \u03b5 \u2212 h 0 < r < rM\n\u2212\u03c82h rM < r, (3)\nwhere \u03b5 = \u03c6Q\/\u03c6A \u0002 1, \u03c40 = t0\/T , hQ = HQ\/H0, \u03c8 = \u221aVN \/VM and rM = pRM ,\nsubject to continuity of h and hr at r = rM and limr\u2192\u221e h(r) = 0.\nEquation (3) can be applied to describe a number of different growth factors besides\nacidity. Consider, for example, the dynamics of oxygen\u2014from this perspective a pos-\nitive growth factor consumed by both normal and tumour tissue. Let C denote the\nextracellular concentration of oxygen, and suppose that tumour cells cease prolifer-\nation when oxygen drops below a threshold concentration CQ . Let \u03c6\u00afA, \u03c6\u00afQ and \u03c6\u00afN\nbe the rates of oxygen consumption by active tumour, quiescent tumour and normal\n123\n770 K. Smallbone et al.\ncells, respectively. We assume that oxygen is supplied through blood vessels at a rate\nr\u00afV , proportional to the difference between the extracellular oxygen and serum oxygen\nconcentration CS . Then we find\nCt \u2212 DC (CR R + 2CR\/R)\n=\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\u2212\n(\n(\u03c6\u00afA\u2212\u03c6\u00afQ)\u03b8(C(t\u2212t0)\u2212CQ)+\u03c6\u00afQ\n)\nKM +r\u00afV VM (CS \u2212C) 0 < R < RM\n\u2212\u03c6\u00afN KN + r\u00afV VN (CS \u2212 C) RM < R,\n(4)\nwhere DC is the oxygen diffusion coefficient, and KN the normal tissue density. Now\nusing the transformations h = (CX \u2212 C)\/C0, r = p\u00afR and \u03c4 = t\/T\u00af where\nCX = CS \u2212 \u03c6\u00afN KN\nr\u00afV VN\n, C0 = (\u03c6\u00afA \u2212 \u03c60)KM\nr\u00afV VM\n, p\u00af =\n\u221a\nr\u00afV VM\nDC\n,\nT\u00af = 1\nr\u00afV VM\n, \u03b5 = \u03c6\u00afQ \u2212 \u03c60\n\u03c6\u00afA \u2212 \u03c60\n, \u03c60 = \u03c6\u00afN KN\n\u03c82 KM\n, \u03c40 = t0T\u00af ,\nhQ = CX \u2212 CQC0 , \u03c8 =\n\u221a\nVN\nVM\n, rM = p\u00afRM , (5)\nwe may recover Eq. (3). Note that this model only makes sense if \u03c6\u00afA > \u03c60, or\nequivalently \u03c6\u00afA KM\/VM > \u03c6\u00afN KN \/VN . If this effective rate of active tumour cell\noxygen consumption is smaller than the corresponding normal rate, the tumour will\nreceive sufficient oxygen supply, and no regions of hypoxia will occur. One minor\ndifference between the two models is that for acid-induced quiescence we require\n\u03b5 \u2265 0, whilst for hypoxia-induced quiescence no such restriction is in place.\nThrough the remainder of this paper, we shall investigate the delay partial differ-\nential equation (3). This analysis will allow us to understand the effects of cellular\nquiescence on cyclical acidosis within tumour tissue.\n3 Spatial homogeneity\nWe first consider the dynamics of Eq. (3) in the absence of diffusion. Assuming spatial\nhomogeneity, within the tumour (r < rM ) we have\nh\u02d9 = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40)) + \u03b5 \u2212 h, (6)\nwhere the dot denotes the derivative with respect to \u03c4 . If there is no lag time, i.e. \u03c40 = 0,\nthen this equation reduces to\nh\u02d9 = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h) + \u03b5 \u2212 h. (7)\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 771\nLooking for steady state solutions to Eq. (7), we see differing behaviours dependent\non the value of hQ . If hQ > 1, then the unique steady state is given by h = 1, whilst\nif hQ < \u03b5 this steady state is given by h = \u03b5. However, if hQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), Eq. (7) has no\nsteady state solution. h\u03c4 > 0 for h < hQ and h\u03c4 < 0 for h > hQ , and thus h globally\nconverges to hQ , even though it is not strictly a steady state solution.\nWe move on to consider Eq. (6) with a non-zero lag time \u03c40. Given experimentally\ndetermined parameter values of p = 4.7 cm\u22121, H0 = 10\u22122 mM and DH = 1.08 \u00d7\n10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 [7,15,20], we may calculate T = 4.2 \u00d7 103 s, meaning that each time\nunit is equivalent to approximately 1 h. We take \u03b5 = 0.01 \u0002 1, as quiescent cells\nare essentially metabolically inactive, and hQ = 0.04 \u2261 pH 6.4 [20]. A change in\ncellular metabolism in response to a change in extracellular acidity is likely to be\nmediated by gene transcription and expression. Thus the lag time is likely to be on a\nsimilar timescale to that of gene transcription; as such we take \u03c40 = 0.5, equivalent to\na lag of t0 \u2248 30 min. Notice that with this parameter set we find hQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), and thus\nfrom the analysis above there is no steady state and we would expect non-equilibrium\ndynamics.\nFor hQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), Eq. (6) has analytical solution\nh =\n{\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 hQ)e\u2212\u03c4 h increasing\n\u03b5 + (hQ \u2212 \u03b5)e\u2212\u03c4 h decreasing,\n(8)\nwhere \u03c4 is shifted such that \u03c4 = 0 corresponds to h = hQ . The maximum and\nminimum acid levels are given, respectively, by substituting \u03c4 = \u03c40 above.\nIn Fig. 1 we present results for the spatially homogeneous model of tumour acidity,\nusing the typical parameter values above. Cycles of acidosis are observed; the acid\nlevels vary between their maximum level of h \u2248 0.42 \u2261 pH 5.4 to their minimum\nlevel of h \u2248 0.028 \u2261 pH 6.5.\nThe time from minimum acidity to hQ (A \u2192 B in Fig. 1) is given by\n\u03c41 = log\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 (hQ \u2212 \u03b5)e\u2212\u03c40\n1 \u2212 hQ\n)\n\u2248 0.01, (9)\nwhilst the time from maximum acidity to hQ (C \u2192 D) is given by\n\u03c42 = log\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 (1 \u2212 hQ)e\u2212\u03c40\nhQ \u2212 \u03b5\n)\n\u2248 2.6.

The total cycle time is approximately 3.6 non-dimensional units\n4 Temporal homogeneity\nTypically, the first step we take when investigating the role of a specific metabolite in\ntumour development is to look for temporally-homogeneous solutions to the metabo-\nlite evolution equation. The justification for this is that the timescale of metabolite\ndiffusion (\u223c minutes) is much less than the timescale of, for example, tumour growth\n(\u223c days), and hence the metabolite can be assumed to be in diffusive equilibrium. This\nremoves the need for both the metabolite evolution term \u2202h\/\u2202\u03c4 and the lag term \u03c40.\nAssuming temporal homogeneity, Eq. (3) reduces to\nr2h\u2032\u2032 + 2rh\u2032 =\n{\nr2h \u2212 ((1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h) + \u03b5)r2 0 < r < rM\n\u03c82r2h rM < r,\n(12)\nwhere the primes denote the derivative with respect to r .\nWe may solve Eq. (12) for rM < r ; applying continuity of h and its derivative at\nrM we find that within the tumour\nr2h\u2032\u2032 + 2rh\u2032 = r2h \u2212 ((1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h) + \u03b5)r2 0 < r < rM , (13)\nsubject to the boundary conditions\nh\u2032(0) = 0, h\u2032(rM ) = \u2212h(rM )1 + \u03c8rM\nrM\n. (14)\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 773\nThe second boundary condition arises from the solution h = Ae\u2212\u03c8r\/r , for some\nconstant A, in the outer region rM < r .\nWe will now move on to show that, if hQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1) and rM is sufficiently large,\nEq. (13) has no solution. Consider first a tumour in which all cells are active. Then,\nfrom Eqs. (13) and (14)\nr2h\u2032\u2032 + 2rh\u2032 \u2212 r2h + r2 = 0, (15)\nwhich, subject to the boundary conditions in Eq. (14) has solution\nh(r) = 1 \u2212 k1 sinh r\nr\n, (16)\nwhere\nk1 = 1 + \u03c8rM\ncosh rM + \u03c8 sinh rM . (17)\nIn particular\nh(0) = 1 \u2212 k1 \u2192 0 as rM \u2192 0, h(0) \u2192 1 as rM \u2192 \u221e. (18)\nThus, if hQ < 1, at some radius rM = r\u0007, h(0) = hQ and the cells at the tumour centre\nwill become quiescent. This radius r\u0007 may be found numerically from the expression\nabove for h(0), i.e. through solution of\n\u03c8r\u0007 = (1 \u2212 hQ)(cosh r\u0007 + \u03c8 sinh r\u0007) \u2212 1. (19)\nFor typical parameter values hQ = 0.04 and \u03c8 = 1, we find r\u0007 = 0.31, equivalent to\nthe first quiescent cells appearing when the tumour has radius R \u2248 0.7 mm.\nAssuming that rM > r\u0007, some of the tumour cells must be quiescent. Suppose\nhQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1) and consider a region (r1, r2) containing only quiescent cells, i.e. a region\nwhere h > hQ everywhere. Then, from Eq. (13) within this region\nr2h\u2032\u2032 + 2rh\u2032 \u2212 r2h + \u03b5r2 = 0. (20)\nThe edges of the region r1 and r2 must either be a tumour boundary (0 or rM ) and\nsatisfy the appropriate condition in Eq. (14) or they must satisfy h(ri ) = hQ . We\nconsider each case separately below.\nCase 1: r1 = 0, r2 = rM .\nConsider the case where all the cells in the tumour are quiescent. Then, applying\nthe boundary conditions in Eq. (14),\nh(r) = \u03b5\n(\n1 \u2212 k1 sinh r\nr\n)\n, (21)\nwhere, in particular\nh(0) = \u03b5(1 \u2212 k1) < max(\u03b5, 0) < hQ . (22)\nThis contradicts the fact that the whole tumour is quiescent.\n123\n774 K. Smallbone et al.\nCase 2: r1 = 0, h(r2) = hQ .\nConsider now the case where the quiescent cells are limited to the tumour centre.\nThen in (0, r2)\nh(r) = \u03b5 +\n[\n(hQ \u2212 \u03b5) r2\nsinh r2\n] sinh r\nr\n, (23)\nwhere, in particular\nh(0) = \u03b5 + (hQ \u2212 \u03b5) r2\nsinh r2\n< hQ, (24)\nas r2\/ sinh r2 \u2208 (0, 1), again contradicting the fact that cells at the tumour centre are\nquiescent.\nCase 3: h(r1) = hQ .\nSuppose finally that the cells in the tumour centre (0, r1) are active (h < hQ) and\nsurrounded by quiescent cells. Then h(r1) = hQ and, in (0, r1),\nh(r) = 1 \u2212\n[\n(1 \u2212 hQ) r1\nsinh r1\n] sinh r\nr\n, (25)\nwhere, in particular\nh(0) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 hQ) r1\nsinh r1\n> hQ, (26)\ncontradicting the fact that the cells at the tumour centre are active.\nThe analysis presented above has shown that, when rM > r\u0007 and h \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), Eq. (12)\nhas no solution. As such, the standard assumption of temporal homogeneity is not\nvalid; instead we must consider the temporal dynamics of the system. In the previous\nsection we showed that when h \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), the assumption of spatial homogeneity leads\nto cyclical solutions. Given this evidence, for the full model defined in Eq. (3), we\nexpect cyclical behaviour to occur whenever rM > r\u0007 and h \u2208 (\u03b5, 1). This behaviour\nis analysed in the next section.\n5 Full model analysis\nWe move on to analyse the full model, including both temporal and spatial dynamics.\nThe model is defined by Eq. (3), which we reiterate here\nh\u03c4 \u2212 (hrr + 2hr\/r) =\n{\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40)) + \u03b5 \u2212 h 0 < r < rM\n\u2212\u03c82h rM < r,\n(27)\nsubject to the boundary conditions hr (0, \u03c4 ) = 0, continuity of h and hr at r = rM and\nlimr\u2192\u221e h(r, \u03c4 ) = 0, and initial conditions h(r, \u03c4 ) = 0 for \u03c4 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c40, 0].\nThe method of lines [17] is a technique that may be applied to numerically solve\nparabolic equations, involving discretizing in all but one dimension, and then integrat-\ning the semi-discrete problem as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 775\nThe method allows us to take advantage of the sophisticated tools available for nu-\nmerical solution of ODEs and, in this case, delay (ordinary) differential equations\n(DDEs).\nWe discretize Eq. (27) with respect to the variable r using finite differences, in\nparticular using the approximations\nhr (r, \u03c4 ) \u2248 h(r + \b, \u03c4) \u2212 h(r \u2212 \b, \u03c4)2\b (28)\nhrr (r, \u03c4 ) \u2248 h(r + \b, \u03c4) + h(r \u2212 \b, \u03c4) \u2212 2h(r, \u03c4 )\n\b2\n,\nfor small \b.\nTo use the discretization above, we first approximate the infinite domain [0,\u221e)\nas a finite domain [0, r\u221e], where r\u221e = krM for some integer k > 1. The boundary\ncondition at r = \u221e is then replaced by the condition h(r\u221e, \u03c4 ) = 0. We then choose\na uniform grid r j , j = 1, . . . , k N with spacing \b = r\u221e\/k N = rM\/N such that\nr j = j\b. This allows us to define h j (\u03c4 ) = h(r j , \u03c4 ) to be the value of h at each of\nthese grid points.\nThe Dirichlet boundary condition h(r\u221e, \u03c4 ) = 0 is handled easily by defining\nhk N (\u03c4 ) = 0. The Neumann boundary condition hr (0, \u03c4 ) = 0 requires more care. We\nfirst apply l\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s rule to obtain\nlim\nr\u21920\nhr (r, \u03c4 )\nr\n= lim\nr\u21920\n[hr (r, \u03c4 )]r\n[r ]r = hrr (0, \u03c4 ). (29)\nTo handle this second order difference, imagine the problem is instead being solved\non the domain [\u2212r\u221e, r\u221e], with the tumour tissue confined to [\u2212rM , rM ] and the same\nboundary conditions at r = \u00b1r\u221e. The Neumann boundary condition then implies that\nthe solution will be symmetric with respect to r for all time. Thus h(\u2212\b, \u03c4) = h(\b, \u03c4),\nso h\u22121(\u03c4 ) = h1(\u03c4 ).\nThe system of (k N + 1) DDEs in the variable \u03c4 is then given by\nh\u2032j =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n6\n[\nh1 \u2212 h0\n]\n\b\u22122 + f0 j = 0[\n(1 + j\u22121)h j+1 + (1 \u2212 j\u22121)h j\u22121 \u2212 2h j\n]\n\b\u22122 + f j j = 1, . . . , N[\n(1 + j\u22121)h j+1+(1 \u2212 j\u22121)h j\u22121\u22122h j\n]\n\b\u22122\u2212\u03c82h j j = N +1, . . . , k N \u22121\n0 j = k N ,\n(30)\nwhere\nf j (\u03c4 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h j (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40)) + \u03b5 \u2212 h j (\u03c4 ). (31)\nThe system of DDEs in Eq. (30) is solved using the MATLAB\u0001 integrator dde23\n[22]. Preliminary tests showed that k = 5 was a suitable choice\u2014integrating over\ndomains larger than [0, 5 rM ] had a negligible effect on the system solution.\n123\n776 K.

Parameter values used are\nas in Fig. 2. The dotted lines represent the tumour radius (rM = 1) and quiescence threshold (hQ = 0.04)\nTypical model solutions are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Given typical parameter values\nof hQ = 0.04 and \u03c8 = 1, we may calculate from Eq. (19) r\u0007 = 0.31, the tumour\nradius at which quiescence first occurs. Choosing rM = 1 > r\u0007 and \u03b5 = 0.01, we\nhave hQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1), and thus, from previous analyses, we would expect cyclical acidosis\nto occur.\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 777\nFigure 2 shows cyclical acidity at the tumour centre and tumour edge using these\nparameter values. The cells at the tumour centre cycle between their maximum level\nof h \u2248 0.23 \u2261 pH 5.6 and their minimum level h \u2248 0.016 \u2261 pH 6.7. The cells\nat the tumour edge also experience cyclical acidity about the quiescence threshold,\nthough their maximum acidity h \u2248 0.11 \u2261 pH 5.9 is less than the cells at the centre.\nThe cycle time is \u03c4c \u2248 1.4, equivalent to 100 min.\nThis may be compared to the spatially homogeneous model presented in Fig. 1.\nAddition of diffusion to the model acts to smooth the spatial profile of the dynamics,\nreducing the maximum acidity levels seen and in turn decreasing the acid cycle time.\nIntuitive understanding of the reasons for the reduction in cycle time may be gained\nthrough approximation of peritumoural acid diffusion and removal as a simple damp-\ning effect on the spatially homogeneous system. Including this in Eq. (6), we have\nh\u02d9 = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b8(hQ \u2212 h(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40)) + \u03b5 \u2212 h \u2212 \u03bah, (32)\nwhere the term \u2212\u03bah represents the additional role of diffusion. Through a suitable\ntransformation, we may recover Eq. (6), and hence an analogous definition for cycle\ntime, valid if hQ(1 + \u03ba) \u2208 (\u03b5, 1)\n\u03c4c = 11 + \u03ba log\n[(\ne\u03c40(1+\u03ba) 1 \u2212 \u03b5\nhQ(1 + \u03ba) \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 1\n)(\ne\u03c40(1+\u03ba) 1 \u2212 \u03b5\n1 \u2212 hQ(1 + \u03ba) \u2212 1\n)]\n.\n(33)\nAt our default parameter values, \u2202\u03c4c\/\u2202\u03ba < 0 at \u03ba = 0, and thus damping acts to\nreduce cycle time. By equating Eq. (33) with our known cycle time of \u03c4c = 1.4 in the\npresence of diffusion, we find an effective damping coefficient of \u03ba \u2248 3.6.\nIn Fig. 3 we investigate how acidity levels vary through the tumour during each\ncycle. Initially, all the cells within the tumour are below the quiescence threshold.\nCycles of acidity are out of phase for different sections of the tumour and an increase\nin acidity is first seen at the tumour edge (r = 1). Acidity then increases at the tumour\ncentre (r = 0), before reaching its maximum level. This figure demonstrates that,\nwhilst acid levels are on average higher in the tumour centre than the tumour edge,\nthis property does not hold for all points in the acid cycle. The point is reinforced\nin Fig. 4, which shows how the metabolic characteristics of tumour cells vary during\neach cycle. The first cells to become quiescent due to high extracellular acidity are not\nat the tumour centre, rather this occurs at r \u2248 0.81 near the edge of the tumour.\n6 Discussion\nFluctuations in metabolite levels are known to occur within tumours with discrete\nperiodicities of hours, minutes and days. Cells that are best suited to respond to these\nperiods of cellular stress, such as through constitutive upregulation of aerobic gly-\ncolysis, will be positively selected by somatic evolutionary forces. These cycles are\nassumed to occur due to h\u00e6modynamic variations such as changes in the local con-\ncentration of red blood cells or structural rearrangement of blood vessels.

The first\ncells to become quiescent are located at r \u2248 0.81, whilst the first cells to resume proliferation are at the\ntumour edge, r = 1. For the majority of the cycle, the whole of the tumour is in the same metabolic state,\nwith all cells either active or quiescent. Parameter values used are as in Fig. 2\nwe have investigated a further hypothesis, namely that quiescence in response to cel-\nlular stress, and the corresponding drop in metabolism, provides a negative feedback\nmechanism capable of reproducing such metabolite cycles.\nA simple reaction\u2013diffusion system is used to describe the evolution of the metabo-\nlite of interest. Whilst we focus on the dynamics of acidity within the tumour, the\nmodel is equally valid for any growth inhibitor produced by tumour cells or any\ngrowth promoter consumed by tumour cells.\nMany existing models of both in vitro and in vivo tumour growth [3,6,16,21],\nessentially extensions of the original model of Greenspan [11], describe the evolu-\ntion of the tumour outer boundary in response to vital nutrients and growth factors.\nThese models vary greatly in their complexity and application, including viscosity,\nmigration or cell cycle considerations, for example. Despite this diversity, each model\nhas in common the assumption that, over the timescale of interest such as cellular\nproliferation, the metabolites in the system will be in diffusive equilibrium. Here we\nhave shown, for a biologically realistic range of parameter values (rM > r\u0007 and\nhQ \u2208 (\u03b5, 1)), that this standard assumption is not valid. Rather, when investigating the\ndistribution of metabolites around a vascularised tumour in which cellular quiescence\noccurs, temporal dynamics must be considered.\nWe first investigate a spatially homogeneous model, and find that cycles of acidity\ndue to cellular quiescence occur with a periodicity of around 4 h. Inclusion of spatial\naspects and diffusion reduces this cycle time to between 1 and 2 h, consistent with\nexperimental evidence [12]. Within the parameter regime used here we find the acid\nlevels at the tumour centre will oscillate between pH 5.6 and 6.7.\nGiven the importance of acidic and hypoxic cycles in mediating the evolution of\ncancer cell metabolism and resistance to acidity, further experimental verification of\nthe role of quiescence in inducing metabolic cycles will be of considerable interest.\n123\nQuiescence as a mechanism for cyclical hypoxia and acidosis 779\nReferences\n1.
