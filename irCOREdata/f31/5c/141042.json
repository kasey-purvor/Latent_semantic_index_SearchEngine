Natural \norganic matter suspensions were coagulated with aluminium sulphate and varying \nconcentrations of a non-ionic polymer. The fractal dimensions of the flocs formed were \nmeasured using light scattering and settling combined with image analysis.

Introduction \nThe use of fractal dimension (Df) is widespread in science and many structures have \nbeen described as fractal objects. This includes a diverse range of objects including gas \nclouds in space (De Vega et al., 1996), the mammalian lung (Maroy et al., 2004) and \ncancerous tumours (Kikuchi et al., 2006). Fractal structures can be defined as those that: \ni) Show self similarity regardless of the scale of investigation. \nii) Show a power law relationship between two variables. This may be the \nrelationship between the structure perimeter (P) and length (L); the area (A) \nand L; or the volume (V) or mass (M) and L (1-3). \nPDfLP \u221d    DfP is the perimeter fractal dimension   (1) \nADfLA\u221d    DfA is the area fractal dimension   (2) \nVDfLMorV \u221d   DfV is the volumetric fractal dimension   (3) \n \nNote that Df will take a different value dependent on the relationship investigated. \n \niii) May be characterised by a non-integer fractal dimension.   \nFloc aggregates formed in water treatment have recently been studied as fractal objects \nand are examples of mass fractals because both the internal and surface structure exhibit \nfractal properties (Jefferson and Jarvis, 2006). The application of Df in water treatment \nhas focused on understanding structural changes to flocs during coagulation and \nflocculation and in understanding the properties of floc formed from different \ncoagulation mechanisms. Much of the work to date has looked into idealised or \nsynthetic systems involving model particles (such as kaolin, latex, haematite or humic \nacid suspensions) because more is known about the properties of the particles \ninvestigated (Tang, 1999; Lee et al., 2006). More recently work has looked at real \nsystems looking at the floc fractal dimension of flocs formed from real river, reservoir \n3 \nand lake systems (Ho and Newcombe, 2005; Jarvis et al., 2005a; Chakraborti et al., \n2007). \nThere is still a paucity of information on how fractal dimension can be related to \noperational performance in water treatment. The aim of this work was to measure the \nstructural properties of flocs, with particular emphasis on the fractal dimension, for \nflocs formed from a real raw water dominated by natural organic matter (NOM) using \ntwo separate techniques (settling and light scattering). This was to enable an \nunderstanding of the structural implications of dosing polymer at increasing \nconcentrations to the system in order to act as a floc aid. Other than changing the \npolymer dose, the coagulation conditions investigated matched the conditions used at \nthe water treatment works from where the water had been collected. The values of Df \nobtained were compared for each of the techniques and compared with existing data to \nfurther understand how the use of floc fractal dimension may be used from a practical \nviewpoint. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1 Coagulation tests \nExperiments were carried out on raw water from a moorland WTWs in the north of the \nUK. The water was composed of a blend consisting of 70 % highly coloured moorland \nwater and 30 % river water. The water had a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of \n9.8 mg\/L, ultra-violet light absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) of 32.5 1\/m, a zeta potential \nof -12.7 mV and a turbidity of 2.0 NTU. The raw water was coagulated using \naluminium sulphate at a concentration of 5.25 mg\/L as Al (the dose as used by the \nWTWs at the time of water abstraction) from an Al stock solution of 4.25% w\/w. The \n4 \npolymer used was a high molecular weight non-ionic polyacrylamide (Flowpam \nAH912). Polymer was added at concentrations between 0 and 0.25 mg\/L (at the time of \nabstraction a dose of 0.175 mg\/L was being added to the water at the WTWs in \nquestion). The coagulation pH was controlled at pH 6.0 using 0.1 M NaOH (the pH as \nused at the WTWs). \nCoagulation and floc formation experiments were carried out on a PB-900 variable \nspeed jar tester (Phipps and Bird) with 76 x 25 mm flat paddle impellers using \ncylindrical jars containing 1 L samples of water. An initial rapid mix was carried out at \n200 rpm for 1.5 minutes. At the beginning of this period, coagulant was added into the \nwater. For the systems where polymer was dosed, this was added after 1.25 minutes of \nthe rapid mix to allow dispersion of the polymer. A slow stir period then followed at 30 \nrpm for 15 minutes to enable floc growth. NOM removal was assessed by measuring \nDOC using a Shimadzu TOC-500A analyzer and UV254 removal using a Jenway 6505 \nUV\/Vis spectrophotometer. The charge of the colloids and particles in the raw water \nand coagulated systems were measured using a Malvern Zetasizer 2000 HAS. \n2.2 Floc size and fractal dimension \nFloc size and growth was measured using a previously described technique (Jarvis et \nal., 2005b). Briefly, a laser diffraction instrument (Malvern Mastersizer 2000) was used \nto measure the dynamic size of flocs with time. The suspension was measured by \ndrawing water through the optical unit of the Mastersizer and back in to the jar using a \nperistaltic pump. The suspension particle size was monitored every minute following \nthe addition of the coagulant. Measurements were logged on to a computer for further \nanalysis. During this phase of work the impact of increased shear rate on floc properties \nwere measured. This was carried out by increasing the rpm on the jar tester to 200 for 1 \n5 \nminute after the 15 minutes slow stir period. Following the high shear rate, the rpm \nwere reduced to 30 for a further 15 minutes in order to monitor floc re-growth potential.  \nFloc fractal dimension was measured using two separate methods. Firstly, small angle \nlight scattering (SALLS) was used (subsequently referred to as Df(LS)). The \ndetermination of floc fractal dimension using SALLS has been well covered elsewhere \n(Waite et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2002), so only a brief description is provided here. The \nMastersizer has a ring of photo-detectors at angles between 0.01 \u2013 40.6\u00ba which detect \nlight scattered by the sample. The scattered light intensity I(Q) is a function of the wave \nnumber Q, where Q (m-1) is the difference in magnitude of the incident and scattered \nlaser, given by: \n   \u03bb\n\u03b8\u03c0 )2\/sin(4 nQ =  (4) \nWhere n is the refractive index of the suspending medium, \u03b8 is the scattered angle, \u03bb is \nthe wavelength of the radiation in a vacuum. For independently scattering aggregates, \nI(Q) is related to Q and Df(LS) : \n   )()( LSfDQQI \u2212\u221d   (5) \nA confirmation of the power relationship in (5) is to plot I against Q on a log-log scale. \nA power law relationship exists if this yields a straight line, the slope of which is used \nto give Df(LS). The relationship only holds when the length of investigation is much \nlarger than the primary particles and much smaller than the floc aggregates: \n   \npartagg R\nQ\nR\n11 <<<<  (6) \nRagg is the radius of the aggregate and Rpart is the radius of the primary particle. \n6 \nFloc structural information was obtained from the Mastersizer during floc growth and \nfloc breakage for all of the different polymer doses in the form of raw intensity output \ndata which could then be converted to provide the angle of each detector and the \nintensity of light at each detector using a spreadsheet provided by Malvern Instruments \n(Malvern, UK). \nThe second method used to determine floc fractal dimension was established from floc \nsedimentation (subsequently referred to as Df(S)). A more detailed description of the floc \nsettling apparatus is given in Jarvis et al. (2005a). Briefly, flocs were grown on a jar \ntester as before and after 15 minutes of slow stir flocs were carefully extracted from the \njar and introduced in to a temperature controlled settling column under quiescent \nconditions. As flocs settled in the column, they were photographed using a CV M90 \ncharge-coupled device camera (JAI UK). The image grabber was manually triggered to \ntake a series of 5 images with an interval of 1 second between each frame. The \nprojected area of the floc and the distance travelled by the floc was measured using \nimage analysis software (Image Pro Plus from Media Cybernetics). For each polymer \ndose investigated, the settling rate of between 56-100 flocs were measured. \nFloc Df(S) was measured from the settling rate based on the relationship between the \ndiameter of a floc (d) and its terminal settling velocity (Vt) (7). A log-log plot of settling \nvelocity against floc diameter yields a straight line with a slope of Df(S)-1. \n1)( \u2212\u221d SfDt dv   (7) \nFor both methods of measuring floc fractal dimension, a mass fractal is given where Df \ncan take values between 1 and 3. A higher value of Df indicates a more compact \nstructure, whilst lower values indicate a more open and stringy structure. \n7 \n3. Results \n3.1 Coagulation tests  \nThe removal of NOM with increasing polymer dose for this raw water was seen to \nincrease with increasing polymer dose (Table 1). The percentage removal of DOC (46-\n58%) was much lower than for removal of UV254 absorbing compounds (84-88 %). This \nreflects that UV254 absorbing NOM can be more easily removed by coagulation due to \nthe increased charge and higher MW (molecular weight) of this type of NOM when \ncompared to the non-UV254 absorbing NOM which is normally composed of smaller \nMW and un-charged compounds. These compounds are usually recalcitrant to removal \nby coagulation. The reduction of the magnitude of the negative charge of the zeta \npotential from -12.7 mV to +1.3 mV with increasing polymer dose was interesting given \nthat the polymer used was non-ionic. However given that the floc properties were \nsignificantly different with an increase in polymer dose, the increase in the zeta \npotential was likely to be a reflection of the improved NOM removal seen at higher \npolymer doses through better adsorption\/exchange of NOM on to the larger flocs \nformed at higher polymer dose (Figure 1). \n \n3.2 Floc size and fractal dimension \nThe floc size was seen to increase with increasing polymer dose (Figure 1). When no \npolymer was dosed, the median floc size at the end of the slow stir period was 358 \u00b5m, \nthis increased to 849 \u00b5m for the highest polymer dose of 0.25 mg\/L. The biggest change \nin floc size was observed when the polymer dose was increased from 0.10 mg\/L to 0.15 \nmg\/L which resulted in an increase in median floc size of 230 \u00b5m. When the floc \n8 \nsuspensions were exposed to an increase in shear rate of 200 rpm, the flocs broke, but \nthe response was dependent on polymer dose. The systems dosed with 0.10 mg\/L \npolymer and below broke to a similar size (160-190 \u00b5m). At polymer doses of 0.15-0.20 \nmg\/L the flocs broke to 260 \u00b5m whilst the highest polymer dose only broke to a size of \n320 \u00b5m. There was little difference in the floc re-growth potential of each of the \nsystems. Although the higher polymer doses re-grew to larger floc sizes, all of the flocs \nreached between 55-65 % of the previous size reached after the initial 15 minutes slow \nstir. The incapacity of the floc system to re-grow to the size seen previously is an \nobservation seen before and is thought to result as flocs re-structure during breakage, \nresulting in fewer active bonding sites being available for re-attachment (Yeung et al., \n1997, Spicer et al., 1998). \nTable 1.

The relationship between the scattered light intensity (I) and the wave number \n(Q) on a log-log scale and the determination of the fractal dimension for different flocs \nduring the initial growth phase (A) and breakage phase (B) for i) flocs formed with no \npolymer added and ii) the highest polymer dose added.  \n \nThe Df(LS) value was seen to increase with increasing polymer dose during the growth \nphase (measurement taken from minute 4 in Figure 1) from 2.19 to 2.33 with increasing \npolymer dose. The biggest increase in Df(LS) was from an increase in polymer dose from \n0.10 to 0.15 mg\/L. It was interesting to note that for all systems the fractal value \nincreased as the flocs grew to their maximum size (measurement taken after 15 minutes \nof growth). However, the order of Df(LS) reversed after 15 minutes of floc growth (i.e. \nthe maximum floc size for each system) with the no polymer and lowest polymer doses \nhaving the biggest increase and highest value of Df(LS). When the flocs where broken the \nDf(LS) value decreased for most of the polymer systems, however this was dependent on \nthe polymer dose. For example, when no polymer was added, Df(LS) decreased from 2.45 \n11 \nto 2.28, however the extent of this change was reduced with increasing polymer dose \nsuch that the Df(LS) value did not significantly change at doses of 0.15 and 0.20 mg\/L. \nThe highest polymer dose showed an increase in Df(LS) during the breakage phase from \n2.34 to 2.50. After the floc re-growth period, the floc fractal dimension returned to \nvalues previously seen for the maximum floc size.  \nThe floc settling distribution with increasing floc size for each polymer dose is shown in \nFigure 3. The fractal values obtained for flocs from settling were those for fully grown \nflocs formed after 15 minutes on a jar tester (Table 2). The trend in Df(S) generally \nshowed an increase in floc fractal dimension with increasing polymer dose; the reverse \nof that seen using SALLS. When no polymer was dosed, the Df(S) was 1.70, however \nthere was a high degree of uncertainty on this value (analysis of the 95% confidence \ninterval (CI) on the slope of this line indicated that the fractal dimension could have \ntaken a value between 1.56-1.86). At a polymer dose of 0.05 mg\/L the Df(S) was 1.55 \n(95% CI, 1.45-1.67). At higher polymer doses between 0.10 and 0.15 mg\/L, the Df(S) \nincreased to 1.87 (95 % CI, 1.72-2.04) and 1.74 (95 % CI, 1.64-1.87) respectively, \nindicating a trend of more compaction with increasing polymer dose. At 0.20 mg\/L the \nDf(S) value was significantly higher at 1.96 (95 % CI, 1.86-2.04). Interrogation of the \n95% CI of the slope indicated that the highest polymer dose had a significantly larger \nDf(S) than the no polymer system and the lowest dose of 0.05 mg\/L. \n \n \n \n \n12 \nTable 2.

The relationship between settling rate and floc size for systems with \nincreasing polymer dose.   \n14 \n4. Discussion \nPolymer dosing into pre-clarified water is a widely used tool in drinking water treatment \nto aid floc formation and improve the removal of these aggregates during the \nclarification processes.  Therefore, as may be expected, the WTWs investigated in this \nwork sees better clarification performance when polymer is dosed compared to when it \nis not dosed (Nixson, 2007). The particle sizing results clearly showed an increase in \nfloc size and improved resistance to increased shear rate with increasing polymer dose. \nImproved resistance to increased shear rate was apparent because polymer dosed \nsystems were able to maintain a larger average size after exposure to a high shear rate \n(200 rpm). The impact of larger floc size and improved resistance to shear rate with \nincreasing polymer dose can be seen to have a clear link with plant operational \nperformance. For example, a greater number of larger flocs will clarify better, \nparticularly in sedimentation clarification systems (Aguillar et al., 2003). However, the \noperational significance of Df was less clear. \nA highly heterogeneous system has been analysed in this work (with NOM of different \nMW, coagulant-NOM precipitates and turbidity components contributing to the overall \nfloc structure), it is likely that the primary particles that make up the floc are of a similar \nstructure (relatively homo-dispersed primary particles composed of a heterogeneous \nmixture of components). \nThe Df(S) values reported were significantly lower than those obtained using SALLS \nwhich is a result consistent with other studies (Wu et al., 2002). The difference is due to \nthe fact that fractal dimension is an operationally defined value based on the method \nused to generate the value. The Df(LS) generated from SALLS refers to the structure of \n15 \nthe floc aggregates over a small length scale whilst that determined by settling refers to \nthe global structure of the overall floc.  \nThe two different techniques for measuring floc fractal dimension gave contrasting \ntrends in that the Df(LS) decreased with increasing polymer dose whilst there were \nindications that Df(S) increased with increasing polymer concentration. As seen in \nprevious studies, the spread of the data for determination of fractal dimension was much \ngreater for settlement when compared to SALLS as reflected by low correlation co-\nefficients for the regression line through the data (Figure 3) (Liao et al., 2005). This is \nas a result of a number of factors influencing floc settlement behaviour such as floc \norientation and advection effects. For the lowest polymer dose, which resulted in the \nsmallest floc, there was the most scatter (R2 = 0.18). This was because when no polymer \nwas dosed there was a more inconsistent floc structure and a weaker overall aggregrate. \nThe floc were therefore more susceptible to changes in environmental conditions during \nthe measurement procedure (Liao et al., 2005). For this type of scattered system, the \nfractal dimension number is probably an average of a range of values taken by the floc \nin the system. When polymer was added the relationship became stronger with R2 co-\nefficients of >0.30 and this increased to a highly significant relationship at 0.20 mg\/L \npolymer (R2 = 0.82) as a result of a more consistent floc structure as polymer was \ndosed. \nThe difference in the Df measured from the two different techniques was a reflection \nthat the fractal dimension of different sized aggregates was being measured in the \n(Jefferson and Jarvis, 2006). The resolution of the image analysis system used with the \nfloc settling apparatus was only able to measure the properties of floc >100 \u00b5m. For \nSALLS the Df(LS) of the microflocs in the system were measured (from Equation 6), \n16 \ntypically of flocs that were <10 \u00b5m (Wu et al., 2002; Jarvis et al., 2005a). The results \ntherefore show that the small microflocs within the whole floc became more open as the \npolymer dose was increased, whilst the overall floc becomes more compact as polymer \ndose was increased. As was indicated here, previous work has shown that an increase in \npolymer dose usually results in an increase in overall floc fractal dimension (Glover et \nal., 2000; Zhao, 2004). However, most work has shown an increase in microfloc fractal \ndimension with increasing polymer dose when SALLS has been used (Waite, 1999; \nGlover et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2002). This difference was likely to be explained because \nthese previous workers used the polymers as the principal coagulant or because of \ncharge differences in the properties of the polymers used. Polymer bridging was the \nmost likely mechanism for bonding by the non-ionic polymer used in this work due to \nthe increased probability of attachment in these polymers (Besra et al., 2004). In this \ncase, increased polymer dosing appeared to give a more open structure for the \nmicroflocs formed after 15 minutes growth as a result of polymer bridging giving more \ntenuous bonding (Wu et al., 2002). The fractal dimension of microflocs during breakage \nstayed the same at low polymer dose or increased for systems of high polymer dose \nwhere the overall floc size was very large (polymer doses of \u22650.15 mg\/L). It was \nhypothesised that increased polymer bridging within the microfloc at high polymer dose \nheld the aggregates together under the high breakage shear rate due to the strong \nbonding of the polymer. For the microfloc in the systems with low or no polymer dose \nan opening up of these structures was seen at higher shear rates due to the weaker \nbonding in the floc when little or no polymer was present. \nThe increase in the overall Df(S)  of the whole floc as found from settling with increasing \npolymer dose indicated that the polymer bridging within the overall floc produced more \n17 \ncompact aggregates. The exception here was for the no polymer dosed system, that \nappeared to have a high fractal dimension but the high scatter and low correlation co-\nefficient make this value very questionable. This indicated that in the small floc systems \nwith low concentrations, the more compact microflocs have weaker inter-bonding \nforces between the microfloc giving rise to a smaller, inconsistent and more loosely \nconnected overall aggregate. At higher concentrations of polymer, the increased \nmagnitude and strength of bridging bonds was likely to give a stronger and overall more \ncompact structure. \nFrom a practical perspective, polymer is frequently used in order to increase floc size \nand result in a distribution of fewer smaller particles in order to increase floc strength \nand settlement (Besra et al., 2004). The fractal dimension analysis used in this work \nsuggested that SALLS analysis should be restricted to the small microflocs in the \nsystem. Settling gives a better understanding of the properties of the whole floc in the \nsystem and is therefore of more operational use because it is the removal of the bulk of \nthe flocs that is important during clarification. Importantly, care must be taken with \nsettling data to understand if there is a significant relationship between settling rate and \nfloc size and an understanding of the range of values that the fractal dimension may take \nto determine if there are significant differences between Df from different systems. In \nthis work, the fractal dimension analysis identified an increase in the compaction of the \nwhole floc with increasing polymer dose, however there was only a statistically \nsignificant increase between the low and high polymer doses. The fractal value must \nalso be used in combination with floc size, strength and settling rate data in order to \ngive a complete understanding of how floc operational properties change with different \nvariables.  \n18 \n5.
