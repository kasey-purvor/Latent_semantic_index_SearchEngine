In the main, using the real data, the two \nmethods are found to produce similar results. A final discussion considers the \ngeneralisability or otherwise of this finding. \n  \n 3 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThere has been considerable critical discussion of the assumptions underlying \nregression methods (Abbott, 2001; Freedman, 1987; Lieberson, 1985; Pawson, 1989; \nRagin, 2000). In lieu of, or in addition to, these linear algebraic methods, several \nsociologists have argued for a greater use of case-based approaches (Elman, 2005; \nGeorge & Bennett, 2005; Ragin & Becker, 1992). Amongst suggestions for particular \ncase-based methods, Ragin and others have argued for configurational approaches \nbased in set theory (Ragin, 2000; Kvist, 2007). The approach developed by Ragin \n(crisp and fuzzy set based Qualitative Comparative Analysis, or QCA\/fsQCA) has, \nthus far, been used mainly with small to medium sized samples, but can be used with \nlarge datasets (Cooper, 2005a,b, 2006; Cooper & Glaesser, 2007, 2008; Glaesser, \n2008; Ragin, 2006b). Some have seen cluster analysis (CA) as an alternative fruitful \nway forward (Byrne, 2002), others sequence analysis (Abbott, 2001; Wiggins et al, \n2007). \n \nUsers of analytic methods should have, alongside technical knowledge, some \nunderstanding of underlying assumptions, embedded procedures, strengths and \nlimitations. In using Ragin\u201fs methods to analyse large datasets, we have become \naware of important similarities and differences between his procedures and those of \ncluster analysis. At root, these are the consequences of two different mathematisations \nof procedures for classifying cases. While both approaches work with \nmultidimensional spaces, QCA addresses the positioning of cases in these spaces via \nset theoretic operations while CA relies on geometric distance measures and concepts \nof variance minimisation. \n \nElman (2005), referring back to Lazarsfeld and Barton\u201fs work on classification, \nargues for \u201cexplanatory typologies\u201d. George and Bennett (2005), discussing \n 4 \n\u201ctypological theorising\u201d, argue for a combining of case-based comparative analyses \nwith process-tracing as a route to causal explanation. We have considerable sympathy \nwith these approaches, but here, given our focus on procedures and their \nconsequences, and given the nature of the data employed, we stay at the descriptive \nand predictive levels.  \n \nWe first introduce key features of fsQCA and CA. We then provide an abstract two-\ndimensional illustration of a important algorithmic difference between the partitioning \nprocedures of fsQCA and CA. This difference is the central theoretical focus of the \npaper, on which the subsequent empirical three-dimensional comparison of fsQCA \nand fuzzy CA builds. In the empirical section, we compare classifications produced \nby fsQCA and FCA and compare their respective predictive power. We conclude by \nconsidering the generalisability of our results. \n \nQCA\/fsQCA \n \nRagin\u201fs QCA analyses the necessary and\/or sufficient conditions for some outcome. \nThese conditions are often described in the QCA literature as \u201ccausal\u201d conditions \nthough QCA offers no algorithmic solution to the problem of distinguishing \nassociation from causation. What it does allow is the establishment of those complex \ncombinations of conditions, from amongst those selected as potentially causal by the \nresearcher, that are able logically to account for some outcome. We later use the fuzzy \nset version of QCA but we first introduce key ideas using crisp sets.  \n \nMahoney and Goertz (2006) give the following (deterministic) example of a Boolean \nalgebraic solution that might arise from a set theoretic analysis of some outcome, Y: \n \nY = (A*B*c)+(A*C*D*E)      \n \nIn such equations the symbol * indicates Logical AND (set intersection), + Logical \nOR (set union), upper case letters the presence of factors, lower case letters their \n 5 \nabsence. In this fictional example of \u201ccausal\u201d heterogeneity, the equation indicates \nthat there are just two paths to the outcome Y. The first, captured by the configuration \nA*B*c involves the presence in the case of features A and B, combined with the \nabsence of C. The second, captured by A*C*D*E, requires the joint presence of A, C, \nD and E. Either of these configurations is logically (and perhaps causally) sufficient \nfor the outcome to occur, but neither is necessary, considered alone. A is necessary, \nassuming there are just these two paths to Y, but not sufficient. The factor C behaves \ndifferently in the two configurations.  \n \nSufficiency, understood logically, involves a subset relation. If a condition is \nsufficient for an outcome to occur, the set of cases with the condition will be a subset \nof the outcome set. This is shown in Figure 1, based on a hypothetical relation \nbetween an individual\u201fs being of service class origin and achieving a degree. Given \nthe condition, s\/he has the outcome. In applications to real large n data, such perfect \nsufficiency is unlikely, and a situation like Figure 2 might be found, where most but \nnot all of the cases with the condition are members of the outcome set.  \n \n  \nFigure 1: Perfect Sufficiency Figure 2: Quasi-Sufficiency \n \n \nFor crisp sets, the proportion of the members of the condition set who are also \nmembers of the outcome set is used as a measure of the degree of consistency of the \n 6 \nempirical relation with a relation of perfect sufficiency. Figure 2 illustrates a relation \ndescribable as only \u201enearly always sufficient\u201f. Alternatively, using a probabilistic \nview of causation, being of service class origin here is a sufficient condition, all else \nbeing equal, for raising the probability of achieving the outcome to a level equal to \nthis \u201cconsistency\u201d proportion. \n \nVenn diagrams can also illustrate Ragin\u201fs concept of explanatory coverage (Ragin, \n2006a). The proportion of the outcome set that is overlapped by the condition set is \nused as a measure of the degree to which the outcome is covered (\u201eexplained\u201f) by the \ncondition. In Figures 1 and 2, the coverage of the outcome by the condition is low, \nwith only around 40% of the (grey) outcome set covered by the (white) condition set.  \n \nAs a simple example of how crisp set QCA copes with the problem of less than \nperfect sufficiency, consider the data in Table 1, taken from the National Child \nDevelopment Study (NCDS) of individuals born in one week in March 1958.  The \n5800 cases are those we have used elsewhere (Cooper & Glaesser, 2007). In this \n\u201ctruth table\u201d, each row captures one type of case as a configuration of conditions, \nshowing the number of cases with each particular combination of the absence or \npresence of the conditions and the proportion of these achieving an outcome \n(consistency). \nTable 1: Highest qualification better than \u2018Ordinary\u2019 level by class, ability and sex (Cooper & \nGlaesser, 2007) \nCLASS_S \n= service \nclass \norigin \nHIGH_ABILITY \n=  measured \nability in top \n20% (at age 11) \nMALE Number \nof cases \nHQUAL = \nhighest \nqualification \nbetter than \n\u201eO\u201f level \nConsistency \nwith \nsufficiency \n1 1 1 262 1 0.863 \n1 1 0 333 1 0.793 \n0 1 1 359 1 0.691 \n1 0 1 502 0 0.584 \n0 1 0 413 0 0.521 \n1 0 0 458 0 0.485 \n0 0 1 1676 0 0.358 \n0 0 0 1797 0 0.224 \n 7 \n \n \nThe 1s in the table indicate, respectively, membership in the sets \u201cSERVICE CLASS \nORIGIN\u201d, \u201cHIGH ABILITY\u201d and \u201cMALE\u201d, with zeros indicating non-membership. \nThe outcome, HQUAL, is having highest qualifications at age 33 better than Ordinary \nlevel. In no row does the proportion with the outcome reach 100%. This will surprise \nfew readers. Social causation is complex, it is unlikely that these three conditions \ncapture all relevant processes, and \u201cchance\u201d, however understood, will have played a \nrole. Ragin\u201fs proposed solution is to work with a notion of quasi-sufficiency and \nquasi-necessity (Ragin, 2006a; also Boudon, 1974; Mahoney, 2008).  Here, for \nillustrative purposes, we set 0.67 as a minimum proportion for quasi-sufficiency. \nThree rows marked out by entering a 1 in the outcome column go forward to the \nsolution:  \n \nHQUAL =  \n \n(CLASS_S*HIGH_ABILITY*MALE)+(CLASS_S*HIGH_ABILITY*male)+(class_s*HIGH_ABILITY*MALE).   \n \nThis simplifies to\n1\n: \n \nHQUAL = HIGH_ABILITY*(CLASS_S+MALE).  \n \nQuasi-sufficient conditions for predicting this level of qualification are being of high \nability combined with either service class origin or being male (or both). The \nconsistency of this solution is 0.774 and its coverage 0.299 (the latter reflecting the \nlarge proportion of cases with the outcome that fall outside the three configurations in \nthis solution). \n \nfsQCA \n   \nBecause we will be comparing the fuzzy set version of QCA (fsQCA) with FCA, we \nnow introduce fuzzy sets and some operations employed in fsQCA. Fuzzy sets have \nthe advantage of addressing the concern raised by Goldthorpe (1997) that crisp set \n 8 \nQCA, using dichotomies, often jettisons detailed information. Whereas in crisp sets \nthere are just the two states of zero and full membership, in the fuzzy approach there \ncan also be partial memberships. Consider membership of the set of adults (Kosko, \n1994). Most judges would agree that an age of ten would rule out adulthood (a \nmembership score of zero) and one of 30 would rule it in (a score of one). What about \nthe age range 15 to 21? Here it would seem inappropriate to allocate a score of either \nzero or one \u2013 the only possibilities available in the crisp set context. In fuzzy set based \ndescriptions of cases, where a score of 0.5 indicates a case is as much in as out of a \nset, we might allocate a score of 0.9 for the 20 year-old to indicate almost but not \nquite full membership of the set. \n \nMatters become more complicated when we move on to consider fuzzy set union \n(OR) and intersection (AND). Various candidates have been proposed for these \noperations in the fuzzy context (Smithson, 1987). A commonly accepted pair of \ndefinitions (see Ragin 2000) defines the intersection operator as the arithmetic \nminimum of the scores being combined\n2\n, and union as the arithmetic maximum. \nThese are the operators embedded in Ragin\u201fs current fsQCA software (Ragin et al., \n2006a&b). If we wish to negate a set (analogous to moving from \u201eHIGH_ABILITY\u201f \nto \u201ehigh_ability\u201f in the earlier crisp set context) we subtract the score from 1.  A case \nwith membership in the set of adults of 0.9 has membership in the set of not-adults of \n0.1.  \n \nMethods for evaluating the subsethood relation required for assessing sufficiency and \nnecessity have also been much debated (Smithson 1987). Ragin has moved through \nfour measures of consistency while developing fsQCA (Cooper, 2005b). FsQCA \ncurrently works with an analogue of the \u201coverlap\u201d approach employed in discussing \nthe crisp sets in Figure 2. Using this approach, the \u201etruth table algorithm\u201f in fsQCA \n(version 2.0) creates indices of consistency to assess sufficiency (and coverage) using \n 9 \nthe formulae in Table 2 (where mx indicates the membership score of a case in set x, \nthe causal configuration; my indicates the membership score of a case in set y, the \noutcome; and mx\u2229y is the intersection of sets x and y, defined as the minimum of the \ntwo scores; and sums are taken over cases {the i} in the respective sets).  \n \nTable 2: Consistency and coverage indices \nConsistency \n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5 \uf0c7\ni\nx\ni\nyx\nm\nm\n \n Coverage \n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5 \uf0c7\ni\ny\ni\nyx\nm\nm\n \n \n \nThe final issue is calibration, i.e. the allocation of fuzzy membership scores to \nfeatures of cases. Ragin (2000) stresses the importance of using knowledge of cases \nalongside theoretical and substantive knowledge in this process. Since much use of \nQCA has been with small and medium sized datasets, this has been possible and \nfruitful. However, we do not have detailed case knowledge of the thousands of \nindividuals in the NCDS. Verkuilen (2005) provides a review of ways we might \nproceed in such situations. In his terms, Cooper, in earlier work with these data, \nemployed a method of \u201edirect assignment\u201f based on theoretical and substantive \nexpertise to allocate fuzzy scores to class and qualification categories\n3\n. We use those \ncalibrations in this paper (see Cooper, 2005a, for details) because we wish to explore \nthe use of CA with previously analysed calibrated data\n4\n. In this paper, both QCA and \ncluster analysis are applied to these existing fuzzy measures. \n \nWhen using fuzzy sets, because cases can have non-zero membership in more than \none configuration, a special procedure is needed to create a truth table analogous to \nTable 1, where cases are uniquely in one configuration. The truth table algorithm \nemployed in the current version of fsQCA achieves this. We can illustrate this via a \n 10 \nsimple invented example with two causal conditions, A and B, for each case and \nwhere cases have been allocated fuzzy membership in sets A and B. Columns 2-5 of \nTable 3 show the fuzzy set membership values of A, B and their negations (calculated \nby subtracting these values from 1). Columns 6-9 show the degree of membership in \nthe four possible intersections\n5\n of the sets A, B and the negations a, b. Crucially, some \ncases have non-zero membership in more than one of the configurations AB, Ab, aB \nand ab. \n \nTable 3: Fuzzy memberships in A and B and derived sets \nCase id A B a b AB Ab aB ab \n1 1.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 \n2 1.00 0.51 0.00 0.49 0.51 0.49 0.00 0.00 \n3 0.55 0.45 0.45 0.55 0.45 0.55 0.45 0.45 \n4 0.65 0.55 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.45 0.35 0.35 \n5 0.20 0.45 0.80 0.55 0.20 0.20 0.45 0.55 \n6 0.20 0.51 0.80 0.49 0.20 0.20 0.51 0.49 \n \n \nFor each case we have also shown in bold the largest of the four values amongst the \nfour possible intersections. In each row, given we have no values of A or B equal to \n0.5,  we have just one value greater than 0.5, i.e. greater than the crossover value for \nbeing more in than out of a fuzzy set. In his \u201etruth table algorithm\u201f Ragin uses this \nparticular value to locate each case in one \u201ecorner\u201f of the property space (and \ntherefore the truth table) comprising the four sets AB, Ab, aB and ab. This move, \neffectively removing the problems caused by each case potentially having non-zero \nmembership in all four intersections, allows cases to be allocated to just one row of a \ntruth table.  It is the key move in fsQCA, given prior calibration , in allocating cases \nto the theoretically defined types which together comprise the multidimensional space. \nEach case is allocated to the one set, i.e. the one row in a truth table, in which it has a \nmembership greater than 0.5.  \n \n 11 \nWe will return to some other features of fsQCA later, but now turn to CA. \n \nCluster analysis \n \nSince cluster analysis is better known than fsQCA, we describe it briefly. \nConventional (crisp, hard) cluster analysis comes in many forms (Bailey, 1994). What \nthey have in common is the goal of dividing some set of cases into subgroups whose \nmembers are potentially of similar kinds or types\n6\n. Cases are seen as distributed in a \nmultidimensional space, candidate cluster centres are represented by particular \ncoordinates in this space, each case is allocated to just one cluster, and minimising the \nsum of some measure of the distances of cases from their cluster centres is the typical \nprocedure used to determine, iteratively, the final cluster structure and the allocation \nof cases to it. Some algorithms (agglomerative) begin by assuming that each case is a \ncluster and gradually merge these small clusters to form larger ones; others (divisive) \nbegin by allocating all cases to one cluster and then gradually divide this to form some \nsmaller number of final clusters (Bailey, 1994). In the less well-known fuzzy cluster \nanalysis (FCA), CA can also be used to allocate cases non-uniquely to clusters. Here \ncases can have fractional degrees of membership, analogous to fuzzy set \nmemberships, in several clusters, with these memberships, in the basic so-called \nprobabilistic variant of FCA, set to add to 1\n7\n (de Oliveira & Pedrycz, 2007; Kruse et \nal., 2007). In all these variants of CA, the cluster structure found depends partly on the \nparticular sample analysed. \n \nWhile there has been much energy expended trying to mechanise the choice of an \noptimal number of clusters in a given analysis, this choice is still often presented as \ninvolving judgment based on whether theoretical or substantive sense can be made of \nthe clusters found  (Lattin et al., 2003). Here, we constrain the number of clusters to \nmatch the number of configurations in our fsQCA analyses.  \n \n 12 \nHaving introduced these two classificatory approaches, we present, before employing \nreal data, a simple illustration of a key difference between fsQCA and crisp CA that \nalso applies to FCA.  \n \nfsQCA versus CA: a 2-dimensional non-empirical illustration  \n \nWhile fsQCA uses an explicit (set theoretic) argument to justify its partitioning of a \ndataset, forms of cluster analysis depend, most commonly, on distance-based \nmeasures of similarity or dissimilarity. Looking at Figure 3 \u2013 and thinking in terms of \nfour clusters to match the number of configurations generated by a truth table analysis \ninvolving two conditions A and B \u2013 we can see that, given the distribution of the \ntwelve cases across the two-dimensional space, a clustering algorithm based on \nminimising distances between the cases and the geometric centres of the unique \ncluster to which they belong, would be expected, if set to find four clusters, to \nproduce the four groupings represented by different shapes. We can also see that \nfsQCA using the minimisation rule for set intersection, coupled with its rule of \nallocating cases to the set (or configuration) in which they have a membership greater \nthan 0.5, would produce the same partitioning of this population (see discussion of \nTable 3). \n \n 13 \n \nFigure 3: 12 invented cases with membership in A and B \n \n \nNow consider the distribution of cases in Figure 4. Here, using any obvious distance \nmeasure to produce four clusters, we will obtain via CA the four groupings shown \ndifferentiated by shape. The fsQCA partition will however be different, given the \ncritical role of the 0.5 membership score. Here, employing fsQCA\u201fs truth table rule \nfor allocating cases to a unique set, the left-most triangle goes to aB, but its two \ncluster companions to AB. We obtain two different partitions, reflecting the algorithm \nemployed. This exercise sets up a potential competition between the two approaches. \nWhich of the two partitionings might better account for some outcome?  \n \n 14 \n \nFigure 4: 12 different invented cases with memberships in A and B \n \nOne message to take from this comparison is that the extent of the difference in the \npartitionings produced by the two approaches will be affected by the distribution of \nthe cases across the two-dimensional space (and, more generally, across n-\ndimensional spaces). In populations where the density of cases is greatest near the 0.5 \nfuzzy membership scores, differences between the two partitionings will tend to be \ngreater.  \n \nWe move now to a three-dimensional space, using real data from the NCDS. We \nemploy fuzzy measures of class origin, ability and the binary measure of sex, with \nhighest qualification achieved by age 33 as our outcome. We have two reasons for \nincluding the binary condition of sex. First, we wanted to apply CA to the sorts of mix \nof crisp and fuzzy factors that have appeared in published work using fsQCA and, \nsecond, given the way CA treats the binary factor, we can use 2-d figures to make our \ndiscussion of the 3-d case clearer. The differences we discuss between fsQCA and CA \nare not, however, dependent on this decision to include a binary factor. \n \nFsQCA versus FCA: a 3-dimensional empirical illustration \n \n 15 \nWe address a three-dimensional space on the conditions side (fuzzy class, fuzzy \nability, sex) and employ fuzzy highest qualifications as our outcome. We need briefly \nto describe the measures\/calibrations. Given space constraints, we will not set out the \nrationale for these calibrations (see Cooper, 2005a). Our purpose here is to compare \nthe ways fsQCA and CA treat already calibrated measures. Sex is a crisp set, with a \nscore of 1 indicating full membership in the set MALE. Class origin, labelled \nCLASS_F, is allocated the fuzzy scores shown in Table 4. A score of 1 here indicates \nmembership of the upper service class and other scores partial or zero membership in \nCLASS_F. The fuzzy outcome measure we label HQUAL_F (Table 5). The \ncalibration of the ability scores (at age 11) is shown in Figure 5. This reflects its origin \nin Cooper (2005a) where having high ability was defined as having a score in the top \n20% of the cohort distribution. We label this fuzzy version ABILITY_F. A \nconsiderable number of cases have been given scores of 1 or zero, though the majority \nhave partial scores. A score of 1 in ABILITY_F therefore indicates having high \nability as defined.  \n \nTable 4: Class scheme employed (Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1993) and fuzzy scores \nClass Label CLASS_F: Fuzzy score \n1 Upper service 1.000 \n2 Lower service 0.830 \n3 Routine non-manual 0.583 \n4 Petty bourgeoisie 0.583 \n5 Supervisors etc. 0.417 \n6 Skilled manual 0.170 \n7 Semi- and unskilled manual 0.000 \n \nTable 5: Fuzzy scores for highest qualification at age 33 \nHighest qualification gained at age 33 HQUAL_F:  Fuzzy score \nDegree or higher NVQ5 , 6 1.00 \nHigher qualification NVQ4 0.83 \nA Level\/equiv NVQ3 0.67 \nO Level\/equiv NVQ2 0.42 \nCSE 2-5\/equiv NVQ1 0.17 \nNo qualification 0.00 \n \n \n 16 \n \nFigure 5 : Fuzzy calibration of ability (variable n920 in the NCDS files) \n \nThree conditions generate 8 rows in an fsQCA truth table. We use fuzzy clustering to \nproduce 8 clusters to explore the match with these 8 fsQCA configurations. We \ncrosstabulate the fsQCA and FCA partitions, then discuss some cases that fall off the \nmain diagonal. We then focus on accounting for our outcome, HQUAL_F. We \nemploy 5800 cases from the NCDS with no missing data on these and some other \nvariables we have used elsewhere (Cooper & Glaesser, 2007).  \n \nRecall that probabilistic FCA, instead of allocating cases to just one cluster, allows \ncases to have partial membership in several, with the total of the memberships for any \ncase set at 1 (Pedrycz, 2005)\n8\n. We employ the commonly used fuzzy c-means \nalgorithm (a fuzzy relative of crisp k-means) in the software Fuzzy Grouping 2 \n(Pisces Conservation, 2005) to produce our eight clusters\n9\n.  Given the iterative nature \nof this procedure and its dependence on random starting seeding of candidate cluster \ncentres, we have checked that our solution is relatively stable under repetitions of the \nprocedure with and without reordering of the cases in the data spreadsheet.  \n \nTable 6 gives the cluster centres for the resulting eight clusters.  Allowing for small \nerrors introduced, we assume, by the iterative procedure, we can see that sex is \npreserved as a crisp feature by FCA. Apart from this, though less clearly for cluster 7, \n 17 \nthe cluster centres are distinguished by the various possible combinations of high and \nlow scores on CLASS_F and ABILITY_F.  \n \nTable 6: Cluster centres from FCA \n Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Cluster 4 Cluster 5 Cluster 6 Cluster 7 Cluster 8 \nCLASS_F 0.848 0.743 0.143 0.828 0.117 0.141 0.644 0.113 \nABILITY_F 0.940 0.288 0.834 0.928 0.113 0.863 0.420 0.097 \nMALE 0.003 0.992 0.996 0.997 0.003 0.003 0.008 0.997 \n \n \nTable 7 crosstabulates membership in the fsQCA configurations with membership in \nthe cluster in which each case has the largest membership. 94.28% of cases fall on the \nleading diagonal, and no cells mix sexes. If we repeat this exercise, but only using \ncases from the FCA solution who have a degree of membership over 0.5 (to simulate \nthe way the fsQCA truth table algorithm locates cases in a unique configuration), then \n97.46% of 4652 cases fall on the leading diagonal.  \n \nTable 7: The fsQCA configurations by best FCA cluster (number of cases) \n FCA cluster where each case has its maximum membership \nfsQCA configuration \n(Class, Ability, Male) \n4 1 2 7 3 6 8 5 \n111 742 0 60 0 0 0 0 0 \n110 0 784 0 155 0 0 0 0 \n101 0 0 400 0 0 0 0 0 \n100 0 0 0 306 0 0 0 0 \n011 0 0 3 0 705 0 0 0 \n010 0 0 0 22 0 848 0 0 \n001 0 0 33 0 29 0 827 0 \n000 0 0 0 30 0 0 0 856 \n \n \nThe cluster centres from the FCA, four for each sex, seem to represent four ideal \ntypical cases that cover the same high\/high, low\/low, high\/low and low\/high \ncombinations of class and ability as does fsQCA. There are, however, some fairly \nlarge groups off the diagonal (e.g. the 155 cases comprising configuration 110 by \ncluster 7). Who are they? Why are they are off the diagonal?  \n \n 18 \nSince it\u201fs the largest absolute mismatch, let\u201fs take the cell with 155 cases as an \nexample. For QCA, these are cases in the set\/configuration 110, i.e. females with \nmembership above 0.5 in both CLASS_F and ABILITY_F. We find, as would be \nexpected from our earlier 2-d illustration, that at least one of the fuzzy scores for class \nor ability is near the 0.5 boundary. These cases are females, either in Goldthorpe\u201fs \nclass 3 or they are in the service class (1 or 2) but with ability scores close to 0.5.  \nHolding sex to female, i.e. taking a 2-d slice through the 3-d space, the 155 cases are \nshown in Figure 6, which also shows the 4 cluster centres for females. The 155 cases \nhug at least one of the 0.5 boundaries. We have here an empirical example of the \nproblem we described in Figure 4. \n \n \nFigure 6: the 155 cases in both configuration 110 and with maximum membership in \nfuzzy cluster 7 (with 4 cluster centres for females) \n \n \nTurning to FCA, we need to look at cluster \u201e7\u201f, of which these 155 cases are \nmembers. The cluster centre for this cluster is at 0.64, 0.42 and 0 for class, ability and \n 19 \nsex. The prototypical member of this cluster (0.64, 0.42, 0) would not be allocated, \nunder fsQCA, to the configuration 110 since ability is not above 0.5. Most cases in \ncluster 7 are, in fact, in the fsQCA configuration 100. These 155 members of cluster \n7, however, have fuzzy ability scores above 0.5, as well as a fuzzy class score above \n0.5 and a MALE score of zero, and so go to 110.  \n \n \nWe can take, for further illustration, the modal cases, of which there are 16, from \namong the 155; they have scores of 0.58, 0.58, 0 (Figure 6). Notwithstanding their \nmembership in the configuration 110, their distance from the centre of cluster 7 is \nsmaller, as expected, than their distance from any of the other clusters containing \nfemales. They are nearer this cluster centre than the one that appears most like QCA\u201fs \n110 (which is cluster 1 with centre 0.85, 0.94, 0). The nearness of these 16 cases to \ntwo 0.5 boundaries is the basis of this difference in classification. Although they are \nin 110, they are only just more in than out of CLASS_F and ABILITY_F.  \n \n \nComparison 1: prediction (conventional approach) \n \nWe now look at the extent to which the two classifications predict HQUAL_F. We \nbegin with a conventional approach. We compare the size of the contingency \ncoefficient for, first, the relation between the cases\u201f memberships in fuzzy highest \nqualification (Table 5) and in their fsQCA configuration, and, second, for the relation \nbetween their membership in fuzzy highest qualification and their membership in the \nfuzzy cluster in which each case has maximum membership. The two contingency \ncoefficients are 0.487 (for fsQCA) and 0.492 (for FCA). Both classifications explain \nvery similar amounts of variation.  \n \nComparison 2: prediction (set theoretic) \n \nWe now compare fsQCA and FCA-based prediction using a set theoretic approach.  \nHere, we compare fsQCA and FCA on fsQCA\u201fs own ground. We attempt a \n 20 \ncomparison of the predictive power of two classifications based on CLASS_F, \nABILITY_F and MALE using quasi-sufficiency in place of variance explained. First, \nwe describe the set theoretic solution of the model HQUAL_F=Function(CLASS_F, \nABILITY_F, MALE). In doing this, we introduce a feature of the truth table \nalgorithm in fsQCA that will be seen to have motivated our use of fuzzy CA. This \nadditional complicating feature is that the truth table algorithm in fsQCA, although it \nallocates cases to a unique row of the truth table on the basis of their having a score of \nover 0.5 in just one configuration, actually calculates the consistency and coverage \nindices for each configuration for all cases with non-zero membership, not just these \nstrongest ones (Ragin, 2004). Ragin\u201fs argument is that the number of cases in each \nrow can be used as an indicator of the existence or otherwise of strong exemplars of \neach configuration but that the relation between the sets represented by the \nconfigurations and the outcome should be tested using all non-zero memberships in \nthe configurations.  \n \nTable 8: HQUAL_F=Function(CLASS_F, ABILITY_F, MALE): the resulting truth table \nmost \nsimilar \nFCA \ncluster  \nCLASS_F ABILITY_F MALE number HQUAL_F Consistency \n(from fsQCA \nsoftware) \nCoverage \n(from Excel \ncalculation) \n4 1 1 1 802 1 0.876 0.248 \n1 1 1 0 939 1 0.830 0.268 \n3 0 1 1 708 1 0.791 0.233 \n2 1 0 1 400 0 0.750 0.133 \n6 0 1 0 870 0 0.721 0.252 \n7 1 0 0 306 0 0.721 0.118 \n8 0 0 1 889 0 0.560 0.183 \n5 0 0 0 886 0 0.496 0.163 \n \n \nThe truth table, from the fsQCA software, for the outcome HQUAL_F and the \nconditions CLASS_F, ABILITY_F and MALE is part of Table 8. One additional \ncolumn has been added to indicate the number of the FCA cluster that is nearest in \nshared membership to each configuration. Another provides row coverage figures. For \n 21 \nan illustrative solution, we take the three highest consistency levels as indicating \nconsistency with quasi-sufficiency. Doing this allows three configurations into the \nsolution (111, 110, 011). The simplified solution becomes:  \n \n(CLASS_F*ABILITY_F)+(ABILITY_F*MALE) or, simplifying further,  \n \nABILITY_F*(CLASS_F+MALE).  \n \nThe software calculates the overall consistency and coverage for this solution. To do \nthis, cases\u201f memberships in ABILITY_F*(CLASS_F+MALE), calculated using the \nindividual scores for the three conditions, become the mx in the formulae in Table 2 \n(and cases\u201f scores on HQUAL_F supply the my). Overall consistency is 0.789 and \noverall coverage is 0.653. \n \nAs explained, the consistencies with quasi-sufficiency in the penultimate column of \nTable 8 are calculated using all cases with non-zero membership. To simulate this \nusing cluster analysis we must use FCA rather than crisp k-means CA, where cases \nhave membership in only one cluster. We now turn to the analysis of quasi-\nsufficiency, with HQUAL_F as the outcome, treating the FCA clusters as sets in \nwhich cases have the partial memberships allocated by FCA. Here we simulate the \napproach used in fsQCA\u201fs truth table algorithm, i.e. we allow all cases with non-zero \nmembership in a cluster to contribute to the calculation of consistency and coverage. \nTable 9 is the resulting truth table giving consistency and coverage figures for each \ncluster. It includes the fsQCA configurations that are the \u201elookalikes\u201f for FCA \nclusters. The cluster rows are ordered by descending consistency. Given the \napproximate mapping of configurations onto clusters, the orderings of consistency are \nalmost the same in Tables 8 and 9. Row coverage figures are also similar. A three-row \nsolution of this table comprises FCA clusters 4, 1 and 3. A glance at the \u201elookalike\u201f \nconfigurations for these clusters shows this to be the parallel solution to the one \n 22 \nderived using fsQCA. Using FCA, we have, in our simulated set theoretic analysis, \nproduced results structurally similar to those of fsQCA. \n \nTable 9: HQUAL_F as outcome, using FCA clusters as the rows \nfsQCA \u201elookalike\u201f configuration FCA cluster consistency coverage \n111 4 0.874 0.208 \n110 1 0.840 0.218 \n011 3 0.771 0.190 \n101 2 0.756 0.132 \n100 7 0.745 0.137 \n010 6 0.702 0.198 \n001 8 0.522 0.145 \n000 5 0.457 0.126 \n \n \nWe now calculate the overall consistency and coverage for this FCA solution, as we \ndid for the parallel one produced by fsQCA. We noted, in producing overall \nconsistency and coverage for fsQCA, that we needed to use the individual fuzzy \nvalues of CLASS_F, ABILITY_F and MALE to calculate the membership of a case \nin the illustrated solution, ABILITY_F*(CLASS_F+MALE). Now, we don\u201ft have \nsuch a tidy simplified Boolean expression for our FCA-based solution. We rather have \nCLUSTER_4+CLUSTER_1+CLUSTER_3, analogous to the configurations 111, 110 \nand 011. A case\u201fs membership in this can be calculated by applying the maximum \nrule for fuzzy set union (logical OR) to the three partial cluster memberships\n10\n. Doing \nthis, we obtain, for the three-cluster solution, an overall consistency of 0.812 and a \ncoverage of 0.516. The consistency figure can be seen to be very close to the 0.789 in \nthe fsQCA solution. The coverage figures are less close (0.516 v. 0.653) but we have, \nin simulating fsQCA via FCA, produced similar results.   \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nWe have discussed some of the underlying procedures involved in fsQCA and shown \nwhere they differ from those of cluster analysis. We have employed FCA, a technique \n 23 \nnot well-known in sociology. Our experience tells us that the only way to understand \nthe affordances and limitations of complex analytic techniques is to work through \nthem in the detail we have. We will keep this conclusion brief.  \n \nGiven that fsQCA, via the truth table algorithm, builds its classification of cases on \nthe basis of the assumption that the boundaries set by fuzzy scores of 0.5 should \ndetermine, in conjunction with a particular definition of set intersection, where cases \nbelong, while FCA employs an iterative approach based on minimising some \ndistance-based function, it is perhaps surprising that we have found these methods \nproducing similar results. This applies to both the classifying stage of the work and \nthe subsequent stage of \u201eexplaining\u201f an outcome in both conventional and set theoretic \nways. There are, however, a number of points to make concerning the likely \ngeneralisability of these results. \n \nFirst, we employed existing fuzzy calibrations. Given that we have shown that it is \ncases with fuzzy scores near 0.5 that are likely to be differently classified by fsQCA \nand FCA, it is easy to see that the distribution of fuzzy scores will play a role in \ndetermining the proportion of cases that fall off the leading diagonal in any \ncomparison. Of our two non-binary conditions, one, ABILITY_F, had a large \nproportion of cases with scores of 1 or 0. About a quarter of the scores for CLASS_F \nwere also 1 or 0. Distributions of scores with a higher proportion of cases near the 0.5 \nboundary than ours will tend to produce greater differences in classification. \n \nThis leads to a second point. The researcher using fsQCA needs to create fuzzy \ncalibrations of factors. We can see that different calibrations will produce different \ndegrees of mismatch between fsQCA and CA, simply as a consequence of cases being \nmoved nearer to or further from 0.5. Only therefore in some cases, we anticipate, will \ncomparisons come out like ours.  \n 24 \n \nThird, there is an important point that we have not yet explicitly discussed. The \nconfigurational categories that enter into any fsQCA analysis of the achievement of an \noutcome are given once the choice of factors has been made\n11\n. Membership in them is \ndetermined once the fuzzy scores have been allocated to these features of cases (such \nas CLASS_F and ABILITY_F here). The approach is explicitly theoretical in this \nparticular sense rather than inductive (though some may be tempted to finesse \ncalibrations in an ad hoc manner in order to raise consistency and\/or coverage \nfigures). The key point is that the distribution of fuzzy scores over the cases does not \ndetermine the classification itself, only membership in the configurations comprising \nit. CA is quite different. Cluster structure and membership are produced together, \niteratively. The cluster structure is usually determined by some sort of distance \nminimising procedure and it is partly dependent on the particular sample employed \n(Lattin et al., 2003). In FCA, alongside the cluster structure, the fractional cluster \nmemberships will also change with sample\n12\n. Readers should bear this in mind; again, \nother comparisons may not come out like ours.  \n \nFourth, we should note that we have put a restriction on FCA in forcing it to produce \na number of clusters that match the number of configurations in our fsQCA truth \ntables. Although other work we have done does not suggest that FCA with a greater \nnumber of clusters would have had much more predictive power than that we have \nreported, this is an important point to bear in mind. On the other hand, an advocate of \nfsQCA might point out, in the interests of a fair comparison, that the predictive power \nof fsQCA itself might have been greater given a different calibration of the factors.  \n \nFifth, in this paper we have compared the classifications produced by different \nmethods partly by crosstabulating classifications and partly by assessing the \npredictive power of classifications. In so far as we have relied on the latter, we have \n 25 \nimplicitly taken the view that the types comprising a classification, in so far as they \ncapture real types in the social world, might be expected to have varying causal \npowers. We have not attempted to assess the validity of each classification by \ncomparing it with some independent source of evidence on the nature of such real \ntypes. Indeed, it is not clear to us that, for our purposes, there is any such independent \nsource of evidence.  \n \nFinally, we have observed the tendency, deplored by some, for the ready availability \nof software such as SPSS to lead to uncritical application of analytic techniques to \ndata (Uprichard et al., 2008). We do not want to see this happening to the exciting \nresearch tool, constantly being developed by Charles Ragin and colleagues, embodied \nin the fsQCA software. Ragin himself has, especially in Fuzzy Set Social Science \n(2000) but also, more recently, in Redesigning Social Inquiry (2008), provided plenty \nof detail about the complexities and paradoxes of the fuzzy set approach. Researchers \nshould not, in our opinion, employ fsQCA without an understanding of the material in \nthese works. We hope our contribution here will also act as an additional aid to \nunderstanding for those embarking on the mode of configurational analysis made \neasier by fsQCA and for those who have wondered about its relation to other ways of \nclassifying cases. \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n We have \u201e111 OR 110 OR 011\u201f. From \u201e111 OR 110\u201f we can note, given the chosen threshold of 0.67, \nthat sex makes no relevant difference, and can reduce these to 11- where the - indicates that this third \ncondition makes no relevant difference. From \u201e111 OR 011\u201f we can similarly derive -11. From \u201e11- OR \n-11\u201f we can see that \u201eCLASS*HIGH_ABILITY OR HIGH_ABILITY*MALE\u201f is a simpler solution, \nand we can take out the common factor of HIGH_ABILITY to produce the simplest solution. \n2\n For Ragin\u201fs argument for using the minimum for fuzzy set intersection, see Ragin (2000).  \n3\n Cooper (2006) explored a method not fully dependent on such expertise, derived from Cheli and \nLemmi\u201fs (1995) work.  \n 26 \n                                                                                                                                            \n4\n It also ensures that we use, during CA, only variables scaled to have the same range of values (0-1). \n5\n Calculated by taking the minimum value of each pair. \n6\n The \u201epotentially\u201f is important here. CA can report a cluster structure even where no real kinds exist. \nOf course, the relation of the configurations in QCA to any real types will be only as good as the choice \nof factors and calibrations. \n7\n In fuzzy clustering, partitions of cases produced under this constraint can be misleading (Kruse et al., \n2007, p10) given some distributions of cases in multidimensional space. For our data, we know that \ncrisp k-means CA and probabilistic c-means fuzzy CA produce very similar classifications. This gives \nus confidence that the \u201esharing\u201f of memberships produced by probabilistic FCA is not greatly \ncompromising the \u201etypicality\u201f aspect here (on these features of membership, see Kruse et al. (2007)). \n8\n We had initially, in a longer earlier version of this paper, begun by using crisp clustering procedures, \nwith each case being allocated to just one cluster. However, we had then also to employ, in a second \nstage, fuzzy clustering procedures, where each case can have partial membership in several clusters, in \norder to be able to undertake a set theoretic comparison with fsQCA of the predictive power of QCA \nand CA. For our sample, a crosstabulation of membership in the crisp k-means clusters with \nmembership in the FCA cluster in which a case has its maximum membership has 98.16% of cases on \nthe leading diagonal. In comparing, therefore, \u201cbest\u201d FCA cluster membership with membership in \nfsQCA configurations we are working with nearly the same crosstabulation structure as we had when \nemploying crisp k-means, but we are able, in addition, to make use of partial cluster memberships. \n9\n We use the normally recommended setting of the \u201cfuzziness coefficient\u201d. \n10\n Because of paradoxes in the fuzzy set context (Ragin, 2000, page 241) the results obtained by \nplugging in fuzzy membership scores to the simplified solution ABILITY_F*(CLASS_F +MALE) and, \nalternatively, to \n(CLASS_F*ABILITY_F*MALE)+(CLASS_F*ABILITY_F*male)+(class_f*ABILITY_F* MALE) \ncan be different, while they would be the same in a crisp set context. For an example, consider the \ntriplet CLASS_F=0.55, ABILITY_F=0.6, MALE=1. Indeed, while the overall consistency of our \nfsQCA solution using the simplified solution (the choice made in the fsQCA software) is 0.789, it \nwould become, if taking the maximum of 111, 110 and 011, 0.814.  The comparable coverage figures \nare 0.653 and 0.630.  In the FCA context, we are constrained to use the approach that takes the \nmaximum of the three cluster memberships. \n 27 \n                                                                                                                                            \n11\n Some of these may not have any empirical members, either for logical reasons or because of the \nlimited diversity that characterises social data (Ragin, 2000). \n12\n As we noted earlier, if distribution-dependent methods are used as part of the calibration procedure in \nfsQCA applications, fuzzy memberships will also become partly dependent on sample. However, this \nsample-dependence is not a necessary feature of fsQCA, as it is in CA. \n 28 \nReferences \n \nAbbott, A. (2001). Time Matters.
