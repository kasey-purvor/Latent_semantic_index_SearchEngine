Unlike previous investigations, we include curvature effects of\nthe nanotubes by incorporating both \u03c0- and \u03c3-orbitals in our tight-binding calculations. The\ncalculations show that the narrow curvature-induced bandgaps decrease quadratically with\nelectric field amplitude to zero. As the electric field amplitude continues to increase, the\nbandgap then expands in a similar manner to that presented in earlier studies on metallic\nnanotubes. The bandgap dependence is verified by analytical calculations, which also agree\nwith preceding analyses for the limit of no curvature.\nThe electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have features mak-\ning them suitable for a range of applications in quantum information processing and spintron-\nics. Central to these potential applications is the energy dispersion. It has been predicted [1,2]\nand shown [3, 4] that SWCNTs can be metallic as well as semiconducting. Transport exper-\niments have demonstrated single-electron [5, 6] and field-effect [7, 8] transistor action, among\nseveral other interesting physical effects. In these experiments gates have been applied to shift\nthe electrostatic potential on the nanotubes; however, split gate structures can also be used to\ncreate electric fields. These fields are known to couple bands in the energy dispersion [9\u201314].\nIf the split gates are deposited at different points along a SWCNT, artificial heterojunctions\ncan be created and different types of quantum dot arrays can be produced. Gated structures\nof this kind have been fabricated for multi-walled carbon nanotubes [15].\nThe electronic properties of SWCNTs are normally determined by their chiral vector ele-\nments (n,m) (see refs. [3, 4] for a complete definition and experimental justification). Nano-\ntubes satisfying n \u2212 m = 3p, where p is an integer, have become conventionally known as\nc\n\u00a9 EDP Sciences\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/epl or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1209\/epl\/i2005-10446-x\n760 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\nmetallic nanotubes. However, most metallic nanotubes are in fact semiconductors due to\ncurvature strain. These narrow-gap nanotubes have the bandgap (cf. ref. [16])\nE(0)g =\n\u0001vFacc\n8R2\ncos 3\u03b8, (1)\nwhere vF \u2248 7.25 \u00b7 105 m\/s is the Fermi velocity of graphene, acc \u2248 1.42 A\u02da is the carbon-carbon\nbond length, R is the radius of the nanotube, and \u03b8 = arctan[\n\u221a\n3m\/(2n + m)] is the chiral\nangle. The bandgaps in narrow-gap nanotubes have been observed experimentally [17].\nIn this letter, we argue that narrow-gap nanotubes, in particular the zigzag ones (\u03b8 = 0),\nmay be the most suitable for future transverse electric field experiments, including those using\nlocal gates of the kind described in ref. [15]. This is due to the fact that an electric field causes\na second-order coupling of the conduction and valence bands, and achivement of the required\nfield amplitude is extemely challenging in practical experiments. Predictions suggest that\nthe electric field across wide-gap semiconducting nanotubes must exceed a high threshold to\nmodulate the bandgap [12, 13]. In this letter, we show that narrow-gap nanotubes can be\nmodulated without any threshold field.\nMany low-energy effects in carbon nanotubes can be predicted by a simple \u03c0-orbital model.\nHowever, the bandgaps in narrow-gap nanotubes owe their presence to hybridization between\n\u03c0- and \u03c3-orbitals, and therefore we include all four \u03c0- and \u03c3-orbitals in our model. The\nmodel is based on an orthogonal tight-binding (TB) approach with the following parameters:\nEs = \u22127.3 eV, Ep = 0.0 eV, Vss\u03c3 = \u22123.63 eV, Vsp\u03c3 = 4.20 eV, Vpp\u03c3 = 5.38 eV, and Vpp\u03c0 =\n\u22122.24 eV [18]. We assume that the potential from the electric field varies smoothly on atomic\nscale, which enables it to be entered through the onsite energies. The bandgaps are obtained\nindirectly by calculating low-bias electron conductance through ideal nanotubes after applying\na global electric field potential with various amplitudes to the nanotubes. The result for a\n(15, 0) zigzag SWCNT is shown as the solid curve in fig. 1. At zero electric field the bandgap\nis approximately the same as in eq. (1). The observed quadratic dependence is a consequence\nof the selection rule |p\u2212p\u2032| = 1, where p and p\u2032 denote the bands arising from the quantization\nof the circumferential wave vector in graphene [10, 11]. The selection rule can be viewed as\nan angular momentum conservation requirement, where only certain bands can be coupled\nby the momentum from the electric field. The conduction and valence bands have the same\nquantisation integer and do not satisfy this condition. Therefore, these bands are first coupled\nvia second-order terms, which are quadratic in electric field amplitude.\nThe dependence of the bandgap on electric field can be estimated analytically by making\nuse of a chiral transform [13]. The Hamiltonian of our system can be expressed in three terms\nas\nH = H0 + Hcurv + Hcorr, (2)\nwhere H0 is the first-order tight-binding Hamiltonian, Hcurv is a curvature term, and Hcorr is\na second-order tight-binding correction term. The first term of the Hamiltonian is the same\nas the Weyl Hamiltonian for a massless relativistic spin-(1\/2) particle, that is\nH0 = \u2212i\u0001vF \u0011\u03c3 \u00b7 \u2207 + V, (3)\nwhere \u0011\u03c3 is the Pauli matrix vector, \u0011q \u2261 \u2212i\u0011\u2202 = \u2212i(\u2202x, \u2202y)T is the electron quasi-momentum\noperator, and the potential from the transverse electric field is\nV = V0 cos\ny\nR\n.

The solid curve represents a cubic spline\ninterpolation of the numerical data points (where the modulus constraint was temporarily removed\nto deal with the discontinuity in the first derivative) and should be compared with the analytical\nprediction that is shown as the dashed curve. The initial gap is due to the curvature of the nano-\ntube. As field amplitude increases, the bandgap is gradually suppressed to zero. The bandgap grows\nquadratically as the electric field amplitude is further increased.\nThe curvature term is\nHcurv = \u03bb\u0001vF \u0011\u03c3 \u00b7 a\u02c6c, (5)\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 acc\/16R2 and a\u02c6c = sin 3\u03b8 x\u02c6 + cos 3\u03b8 y\u02c6 [16]. \u03b8 is the chiral angle, which is 0 for\nzigzag nanotubes and \u03c0\/6 for armchair nanotubes. Finally, the correction term is\nHcorr = \u03b7\u0001vF ei\n3\u03b8\n2\n\u03c3\nz [2\u03c3x\u2202x\u2202y + \u03c3y(\u22022x \u2212 \u2202\n2\ny)]e\n\u2212i 3\u03b8\n2\n\u03c3\nz , (6)\nwhere \u03b7 \u2261 acc\/4. The rotation, Rz(3\u03b8), makes this expression valid for all carbon nanotubes,\nincluding chiral nanotubes. There is no explicit x-dependence in the Hamiltonian. Therefore,\nthe wave function can be separated, \u03a8(x, y) = \u03c8(x)\u03c6(y), where the boundary condition in\nthe circumferential direction is periodic for the narrow-gap nanotubes covered in this paper.\nThe circumferential y-dependence in the potential can be eliminated by the chiral gauge\ntransformation [13]\n\u03c6(y) = e\u2212i\u03c3y\u03b6(y) \u03c6\u02dc(y), (7a)\n\u03b6(y) \u2261\nV0\n\u0001vF\nR sin\ny\nR\n. (7b)\n762 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\nThis transformation leaves the periodic boundary condition of the wave function \u03c6(y) un-\nchanged, but leads to the new Hamiltonian\nH\u02dc = ei\u03c3y\u03b6(y) H e\u2212i\u03c3y\u03b6(y). (8)\nThe conduction and valence bands of a narrow-gap nanotube have the quantisation condition,\nqy = 0. Therefore, we can treat the transverse electric field as a perturbation, where the\nunperturbed wave function \u03c6\u02dc is constant. By integrating over the y-coordinate in the envelope\nfunction equation, re-aligning the dispersion to qx = 0, and approximating the Hamiltonian\nto first order, we obtain the following one-dimensional effective Hamitonian:\nH\u02dc1D = \u0001vF cos 3\u03b8\n[\n\u03bb +\n\u03b7\n2\n(\nV0\n\u0001vF\n)2\n]\n\u03c3y \u2212 i\u0001vFJ0\n(\n2V0R\n\u0001vF\n)\n\u03c3x\u2202x. (9)\nThis Hamiltonian has the form of a semiconducting tight-binding Hamiltonian. However, the\nusual group velocity has an extra Bessel function factor, which predicts slower low-energy\nelectrons in the presence of a transverse electric field. This effect is so strong that the electron\nvelocity undergoes a sign reversal at the first Bessel function node [13]. Substituting V0 = \u03b5R,\nwhere \u03b5 is the electric field amplitude, we find that the critical field is \u03b5c = 1.2024\u0001vF\/R2.\nAbove this field the direct bandgap moves away from k = 0, and our model breaks down. Below\nthe critical field, on the other hand, we can use eq. (9) to calculate the bandgap, yielding\nEg(\u03b5) =\n\u0001vFacc\n4\ncos 3\u03b8\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n1\n2R2\n\u2212\n(\nR\n\u0001vF\n)2\n\u03b5\n2\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n. (10)\nThis function is plotted as the dashed line in fig. 1 and exhibits the same characteristics as the\nnumerical results. There is no anti-crossing in our model; instead, we can calculate the electric\nfield \u03b5\u2217, at which the bandgap closes for narrow-gap chiral or zigzag nanotubes. Identifying\nEg(0) = E\n(0)\ng (cf. eq. (1)) gives\n\u03b5\n\u2217 =\n4\n\u221a\n2E(0)g\nacc cos 3\u03b8\n=\n\u0001vF\n\u221a\n2R2\n. (11)\nEquations (10) and (11) reveal that the bandgaps of narrow-gap nanotubes with larger radii\nrespond more strongly to a transverse electric field. This is due to the increased potential\ndifference across these nanotubes. Larger nanotubes have also smaller initial bandgaps (see\neq. (1)) because their curvature strains are less. In the limit of no curvature eq. (10) simplifies\nto the bandgap dependence reported in refs. [13,14].\nThe main challenge in utilizing a transverse electric field for bandgap modulations stems\nfrom the required field amplitudes. The electric field generated by a split gate in an actual\nexperiment is partly dielectrically screened. The dielectric constant in narrow-gap nanotubes is\nof order 4\u20135 in the transverse direction [13,14,19,20]. An electric field amplitude of 5 MeV\/cm\nbetween the split gates is sufficient to close the bandgaps in very large (R \b 18 A\u02da) narrow-\ngap nanotubes. The same field should also be able to make smaller bandgap modulations\nin smaller nanotubes. Wide-gap semiconducting nanotubes behave rather differently and\nrequire that the electric field overcome a high threshold in order to affect the bandgap [12,13].\nFigure 2 confirms this from our modelling of wide-gap semiconducting nanotubes, and shows\nthat at sufficiently high field there can be multiple closures of the bandgap. The bandgap\noscillations also occur in narrow-gap nanotubes at high fields, \u03b5 > \u03b5c. The threshold field is\nD.

The solid curve represents a cubic spline\ninterpolation of the numerical data points (where the modulus constraint was temporarily removed\nto deal with the discontinuities in the first derivative). The electric field amplitude needs to exceed\na threshold amplitude, in this case about 10MeV\/cm, before the bandgap becomes noticeably mod-\nulated. Thereafter, the bandgap decreases almost linearly to zero and then continues to succesively\nopen and close.\napproximately \u03b5th \u2248 0.6215\u0001vF\/R2 [13] which is about 12% less than \u03b5\u2217 (cf. the threshold\nfield in fig. 2 with the closure field in fig. 1). Since a threshold field in wide-gap nanotubes is\napproximately the same as the closure field in narrow-gap nanotubes with the same radii, we\nexpect the required closure field to be significantly less in the narrow-gap nanotubes. Because\nof the difference in required electric field amplitudes, narrow-gap nanotubes are likely to be\nthe most suitable for use in field-modulated electron transport experiments.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nThis research is part of the QIP IRC (GR\/S82176\/01) and was supported through the\nForesight LINK Award Nanoelectronics at the Quantum Edge by EPSRC (GR\/R660029\/01)\nand Hitachi Europe Ltd.
