INTRODUCTION\nThe level schemes of the A = 13, T = 3\/2 nuclei are\nsparse due to experimental difficulties in reaching them in\nconventional nuclear reactions. Although some excited states\nhave been identified in 13B, mainly using the 11B(t,p) reaction\n[1] (Fig. 1), there exists no definite knowledge about their\nquantum characteristics and hence no knowledge about their\nstructure. A few excited states have been found in 13O using\nthe 13C(\u03c0+, \u03c0\u2212)13O double charge exchange reaction. Among\nthese states, the lowest had an assigned excitation energy of\n2.75 \u00b1 0.04 MeV [2]. A state at a similar excitation energy\n(2.82 \u00b1 0.24 MeV) was observed in the 12C(p,\u03c0\u2212)13O reaction\n[3]. All these data were obtained with an energy resolution\nof \u223c0.5 MeV and limited statistics, resulting in no definite\nquantum characteristics for the observed states. Figure 1 shows\nthat all excited states of 13O are unstable with respect to proton\ndecay to the ground state of 12N. There is a large shift of the\nfirst excited state in 13O, in comparison with the level spacing\nin 13B. This large shift might be related to the Thomas-Ehrman\neffect [4] for s states. The structure of this state can be probed\nin resonance elastic scattering of radioactive 12N on hydrogen,\npreviously studied by Teranishi et al. [5] at zero degrees.\nHowever, no analysis was presented in that article.\nThe nuclear structure of 13O is important for the evolution\nof very low-metallicity massive stars. In 1989 Wiescher,\nBuchmann, and Thielemann [6] suggested several reaction\nsequences that would permit very massive stars with low-\nmetallicity to bypass the 3\u03b1 process. They determined the\nrequired temperature and density conditions where capture\nreactions on short-lived nuclei were of equal strength to com-\npeting \u03b2 decays or inverse photodisintegration. They found\nthat the 3He(\u03b1, \u03b3 )7Be(\u03b1, \u03b3 )11C reactions could represent an\n*Electronic address: bskorodo@nd.edu\nimportant path from helium to carbon isotopes. The 11C\nproduced in this sequence may decay and return to 4He via\n11C(\u03b2+, \u03bd)11B(p,\u03b1)8Be(4He,4He) or be depleted by proton\ncapture into theA> 12 region through 11C(p,\u03b3 )12N. 12N can be\ndepleted into 12C through \u03b2+ decay or by photodisintegration\n(12N(\u03b3 ,p)11C). However, 12N may also capture a proton to\nform 13O through the process 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O. This process can\ncompete with \u03b2+ decay and photodisintegration of 12N at\nsome temperatures and densities. It is important to evaluate\nthe density and temperature regime where this may occur.\nIn this work, the excitation function for resonance elastic\nscattering of 12N+p was measured at several scattering angles.\nThe spin-parity, width, and excitation energy of the first excited\nstate of 13O were determined. An indication of the presence of a\nsecond excited state at 3.29 MeV, with quantum characteristics\n1\/2\u2212or 3\/2\u2212, was obtained. We also examine the impact of this\nnew experimental information on the 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O reaction\nthat might play an important role in nucleosynthesis in low-\nmetallicity stars.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe elastic scattering of a radioactive 12N beam on protons\nwas performed at ISNAP (Institute for Structure and Nuclear\nAstrophysics) at the University of Notre Dame using the\nTwinSol radioactive ion beam facility Ref. [7,8]. A primary\n43 MeV 10B beam with an intensity of 30 pnA was focused\nonto a 2.5-cm-long gas cell filled with 3He at a constant\npressure of 1.3 atm. The secondary 12N radioactive beam\n(half-life 11 ms) was produced via the 10B(3He, n)12N reaction.\nThe outgoing reaction products were captured in the angular\nregion from 2\u25e6 to 5\u25e6 by TwinSol. The two superconducting\nsolenoids of TwinSol act as thick lenses to separate the 12N\nbeam from other reaction products. The magnetic rigidity of\nthe first solenoid was set to focus 12N6+ ions onto a 10 \u00b5g\/cm2\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(2)\/024607(6) 024607-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nB. B.

The second solenoid focused fully stripped\n12N7+ ions onto the secondary polyethylene (CH2) target in\na 1 cm diameter spot. Under these conditions, a 12N beam of\n103 pps having an energy of 46 MeV and an energy spread of\n1.8 MeV full width at half maximum (FWHM) was obtained.\nThe desired 12N ions made up only 7% of the secondary beam;\nthe main contamination was 10B (Fig. 2). The thickness of the\npolyethylene (CH2) secondary target was 8.2 mg\/cm2 to stop\nthe 12N ions. Three Si \u0006E-E detectors placed at angles of\n7.5\u25e6, 22.5\u25e6, and 37.5\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis were used\nto detect recoil protons. Because the primary 10B beam was\npulsed with a repetition rate of 5 MHz and a pulse width of\napproximately 2 ns, the 5.6 m distance from the primary target\nto the array of silicon detectors was adequate to obtain a clean\nseparation of the protons associated with the interaction of\n12N ions in the target from protons associated with elastic\nscattering or reactions of beam contaminants.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe experimental excitation functions, converted into the\ncenter-of-momentum system, are shown in Figs. 4 and 5\ntogether with an R-matrix fit. Figure 4 shows the excitation\nfunction with a single-resonance fit. This does not resemble the\nspectrum expected from several tightly spaced levels as seen\nin 13B. Primarily, this is because the l = 0 resonance is shifted\ndown in excitation energy relative to the other levels due to the\nThomas-Ehrman effect [4]. Indeed, the shape of the resonance\n [MeV]exE\n2.4 2.6 2.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 4.2\n \n[m\nb\/s\nr]\n\u2126\n\/d\n\u03c3d\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nData\n1\/2+ Fit\n3\/2+ Fit\n1\/2- Fit\nFIG. 4.

All other\npossibilities are easily rejected on the basis of shape and width\nconsiderations, as shown in Fig. 4 for an l = 1 resonance. Two\nspin values, 1\/2+ and 3\/2+, can be obtained as a result of the\ncoupling of the 12N ground-state spin, 1+, to that of an l =\n0 proton. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the calculated cross section\nfor the 3\/2+ assignment greatly exceeds the experimental\nvalue. In these calculations, we took into account only one\n(proton) channel for the decay of the resonances. The 2p decay\nto the 11C ground state is also possible (Fig. 1). However,\ndue to unfavorable penetrability, this decay route is at least\n1000 times less probable than one-proton decay. Therefore\nit can be concluded that the single-resonance approach rules\nout a 3\/2+ resonance and favors a 1\/2+ assignment for this\nstate.\nHowever, this conclusion could be changed if distant\nresonances are included and only the absolute cross section\nis considered. In addition to the theoretical predictions and\nexisting data for the 13B spectra, one can find some direct\nindications for the presence of additional resonances in Fig. 4.\nThere is a small dip at 3.29 MeV, and a disagreement between\nthe calculations and the experimental data in the high-energy\npart of the excitation function. A more detailed analysis of\nthe excitation functions is presented below. However, it is\nworthwhile noting that the single level approximation, as well\nas the more sophisticated analysis, both give a very precise\nexcitation energy for the 1\/2+ resonance, Eex = 2.69 \u00b1\n0.05 MeV, whereas the resonance width \u0007 could not be defined\nwith high precision in the present experiment.\nFigure 5 shows the best R-matrix fit to the experimen-\ntal excitation functions. The calculations include, in addi-\ntion to the l = 0 resonance, a narrow 1\/2\u2212 resonance at\n3.29 MeV excitation energy and three distant resonances\n(3\/2\u2212, 3\/2+, 3\/2+). The resonance parameters are tabulated in\nTable I. The parameters of the distant resonances were chosen\nin agreement with OXBASH calculations [11,12] performed\nin an s-p-sd-pf valence space with the WBT interaction, with\nonly 0h\u00af\u03c9 and 1h\u00af\u03c9 excitations allowed. We did not, however,\nuse the excitation energies calculated in Ref. [11,12] because:\n(1) the calculations were not made for unbound states and\n(2) the precision of OXBASH predictions is generally not\nbetter than 1.0 MeV in the region of interest. We also did not\ntry to fit the excitation energies of the two known states in 13O\nat 4.3 and 6.0 MeV because the quantum characteristics of\nthese levels are not known. Although two of the three distant\nlevels appear to be close to the above-mentioned values, this\nmay be accidental. The main aim of including the resonances\nTABLE I.

R-matrix fits to the excitation functions. The solid curves\nrepresent the best fit for a 1\/2+ assignment to the resonance at\n2.69 MeV. The other parameters are given in Table I. The dashed\ncurve (top panel) is the same except for resonance spin 3\/2+ and a\nwidth of 200 keV. The dotted curve is a similar calculation except\nthat the 3\/2+ resonance has a width of 400 keV. All calculations also\ninclude a 1\/2\u2212 resonance at 3.29 MeV.\nin question was to understand their influence on the region\nof interest. Each of these levels, both separately and together,\ninfluence the calculated cross section in the high energy part\nof the excitation function in a similar way, toward better\nagreement with the experiment. We found that this feature\nis preserved when we change the excitation energies of the\nlevels over a broad region. We also found that, if the first\n3\/2+ resonance is located within the energy region of our\nmeasurements, it would produce obvious disagreement with\nthe measured excitation function. However, the presence of the\nsecond 3\/2+ level is necessary as it yields a flat region at higher\nexcitation energy in agreement with the experimental data.\nThe dip at 3.29 MeV excitation energy can be fitted\nby an l = 1 resonance. (Other possibilities were tested and\nrejected after inspection of the predicted shape and width.) The\ncoupling of the orbital angular momentum and spins of 12N\nand the proton would yield a resonance spin of 1\/2\u2212, 3\/2\u2212, or\n5\/2\u2212. All these spins result in a similar shape for the resonance\nbut yield different cross sections. The 5\/2\u2212 assignment can be\nrejected on the basis of cross-section considerations. The fit\nis better for the 1\/2\u2212 assignment than for 3\/2\u2212. However, the\npresent data do not allow for a reliable selection between these\n024607-3\nB. B. SKORODUMOV et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 024607 (2007)\ntwo possible spin assignments. Inclusion of the \t = 1 state at\n3.29 MeV improves the \u03c72 from 1.39 to 0.82.\nFixing the parameters of the weaker resonances, we next\ntried to find the best-fit parameters for the l = 0 resonance.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 5 (top), the 3\/2+ assignment results\nin a cross section that is too large. A somewhat better fit\ncan be obtained for a 3\/2+ resonance with a narrower width\n(200 keV). However, as shown below, the narrow width is\nin contradiction with the excitation energy of the resonance.\nThe best fit parameters (\u03c72 = 0.8) of the 1\/2+ resonance are\n2.69 MeV for the excitation energy and 450 keV for the width.\nUnfortunately, the \u03c72 dependence is very flat, giving a width\nranging from 0.35 to 0.55 MeV.\nA more detailed insight into the level structure of 13O can be\nderived using a potential-model approach with isobaric shift\nconsiderations. As can be seen from Fig. 1, four lowest (closely\nspaced) excited levels have been found at an excitation energy\nof \u223c3.5 MeV in 13B. Although the spins of these levels are not\nknown, the authors of Ref. [1] claim that the spin of the lowest\nof these four states at 3.48 MeV could be 1\/2+, 3\/2+, or 5\/2+\nand that the spin of the state at 3.53 MeV could be 1\/2\u2212, 3\/2\u2212,\nor 5\/2\u2212.\nThe excitation energies of the s states should be strongly\nshifted down in 13O relative to their positions in 13B due to\nthe Thomas-Ehrman effect [4]. Two sets of Woods-Saxon\npotentials were used to calculate this shift for a pure 2s1\/2\nsingle-particle state. The first one was rather conventional\n(Table II, first row). The other one was taken in agreement\nwith the recommendation in Ref. [13] (Table II, second row).\nIn both cases, the well depth was chosen to fit the excitation\nenergy of the lowest excited state in 13B. The results of these\npotential-model calculations are summarized in Table II. Both\nparameter sets give similar values for the shift, \u223c1 MeV. Thus,\nthe predicted position of the \t = 0 single-particle resonance\nin 13O is 2.4\u20132.5 MeV. (It was verified that the positions\nand widths of the calculated single-particle resonances are\ninsensitive to Coulomb radius variations in the region from\nrCoul. = 0.7 to 1.2 fm.) Evidently, the shift of the specific\nstate is proportional to the single-particle spectroscopic factor.\nSimple considerations lead to the conclusion that the 1\/2+\nlevel has a larger single-particle spectroscopic factor than the\n3\/2+ state. Indeed, due to the sign of the spin-orbit interaction,\nthe d5\/2 configuration is close to the 2s1\/2 state. With a core\nspin equal to 1+, the d5\/2 configuration cannot contribute\nto a 1\/2+ state, whereas it can directly contribute to 3\/2+\nstates.

OXBASH shell-model calculations confirm\nthe simple considerations above. They predict one low-lying\n1\/2+ state with a single-particle spectroscopic factor of 0.67\nand two 3\/2+ states (see Fig. 1) lying above the 1\/2+ state\nand having 2s1\/2 spectroscopic factors equal to 0.27 and 0.44,\nrespectively. Therefore, the 1\/2+ state in 13O should be shifted\ndown relative to the 3\/2+ state by several hundred keV, in\nagreement with our 1\/2+ assignment for the first excited state\nof 13O.\nReferring to Table II, a pure single-particle level would be\n\u223c300 keV lower than the experimental excitation energy of\n2.69 MeV. This leaves room for a more complicated structure\nfor the 1\/2+ state in 13O. To obtain the correct excitation\nenergy, the single-particle spectroscopic factor for this state\nwould be 0.60\u20130.77 (the lower value corresponds to the more\ndiffuse potential). Using the data from Table II, one can obtain\nthe corresponding widths for an s state at 2.69 MeV. These\nare 440 keV for the \u201cconventional\u201d potential and 507 keV for\nthe \u201cdiffuse\u201d potential. These values provide an additional\nreason to exclude the fits based on the assumption that\nthe lowest excited state in 13O is a narrow 3\/2+ state.\nIt seems important to note that more exact experimental\ndata on the width of this state would be decisive for the\nchoice of a potential to describe the single-particle states\nof drip-line nuclei in this region. At present we note\nthat the spectroscopic factor corresponding to the diffuse\npotential is closer to the OXBASH prediction of Sf =\n0.67.\nContinuing these considerations, one can relate the (1\/2,\n3\/2)\u2212state in 13O to the second excited state in 13B. The\n\u223c200 keV shift in the excitation energy of these states can\nbe explained as a manifestation of the \u201cpure\u201d Thomas-Ehrman\neffect [4] for \t = 1 state (this state is bound against particle\ndecay in 13B but unbound in 13O).\nIV. ASTROPHYSICAL S FACTOR AND REACTION RATES\nFOR THE 12N( p, \u03b3 )13O RADIATIVE CAPTURE\nThe first estimate of the reaction rate and astrophysical\nS-factor for 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O radiative capture was carried out in\nRef. [6], where it was assumed that the reaction proceeds\nthrough the 3\/2+ resonance at an excitation energy of Ex\n= 2.75 MeV via direct E1 capture to the ground state of\n13O. The radiative width of the first resonance was assumed\nto be 24 meV. The proton partial width of the resonance\nwas not available at that time. The astrophysical factor for\ndirect radiative capture was also estimated but the interference\nbetween the direct and resonance terms was not taken into\naccount [6].\nThe new experimental data on the first excited state\nin 13O prompt a re-evaluation of the 12N(p,\u03b3 ) reaction\nrate. Calculations have been performed within the frame-\nwork of the R-matrix method using the equations given in\nRefs. [14,15]. The direct proton s \u2192 p E1 capture to the\nground state in 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O is predominantly peripheral due\nto the small proton binding energy of the ground state: \u03b5 =\n1.51 MeV. Therefore, the overall normalization of the direct\n024607-4\nLOWEST EXCITED STATES OF 13O PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 024607 (2007)\ncapture amplitude is entirely determined by the asymptotic\nnormalization coefficient (ANC) for the virtual synthesis\n12N + p \u2192 13O. Unfortunately this ANC is not yet available.\nFor a more accurate estimation of the direct and total\nastrophysical factors for 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O, it is imperative to\ndetermine the proton ANC for the ground state of 13O.\nIn this work the 13O ground state ANC was estimated using\nthe following approach. The single-particle spectroscopic\nfactor for the 13O ground state was calculated using the shell-\nmodel code OXBASH, which produces a spectroscopic factor\nSf \u2248 0.7 for p + 12N with \t = 1 and the channel spin I = 1\/2\nconfiguration of the ground state of 13O. A spectroscopic factor\nSf = 0.75 was adopted. The single-particle p + 12N wave\nfunction was then calculated, using a Woods-Saxon potential\nwith geometrical parameters r0 = 1.20 fm and a = 0.65 fm,\nwith the depth adjusted to reproduce the experimental proton\nbinding energy. The single-particle ANC (the amplitude of\nthe tail of the proton bound state wave function divided by the\nWhittaker function) for these parameters isb=2.14 fm\u22121. Cor-\nrespondingly, the ANC for 12N + p \u2192 13O is C = bS1\/2f =\n1.85 fm\u22121. Note that due to the small proton binding energy\nvariation of the bound state potential geometrical parameters\ndo not change the ANC significantly. For example, for r0 =\n1.30 fm and a = 0.65 fm the single-particle ANC is b =\n2.27 fm\u22121 and C = 1.96. Another missing ingredient in the\ncalculation of the proton-capture amplitude is the resonance\nradiative width \u0007\u03b3 . The radiative width \u0007\u03b3 \u223c |M\u03b3 |2 from the\ndipole matrix element is given by\nM\u03b3 = \u3008\u03d5gs| \u02c6O|\u03c81\/2+\u3009, (1)\nwhere \u03c81\/2+ is the 13O(1\/2+) resonance wave function, \u03d5gs is\nthe wave function of the ground state of 13O and \u02c6O is the dipole\nelectromagnetic operator. Two different approaches were used\nto estimate it. In the first approach, the shell model was used to\ncalculate the wave functions and the matrix element. A value\nof 2.3 eV was obtained Ref. [17] (assuming that the radius\nof 13O is 2.8 fm). In the second model, a standard R-matrix\napproach was used in which the dipole matrix element can be\nsplit into internal and external parts [14\u201316]:\nM\u03b3 = M\u03b3 (<) + M\u03b3 (>). (2)\nHere M\u03b3 (<) is the internal matrix element contributed by the\nradial integral taken over the nuclear interior (r < R), where\nR is the channel radius:\nM\u03b3 (<) = S1\/2f |\u3008\u03d5gs(r)||r||\u03c81\/2+(r)\u3009|r<R. (3)\nThe channel (or external) matrix element is determined by the\nradial integral taken over the nuclear exterior, r > R, where\nthe wave functions can be replaced by their asymptotic values:\nM\u03b3 (>) = C\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2329\nW (r)\nr\n||r||\u03c81\/2+(r)\n\u232a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nr>R\n. (4)\nHere C is the ANC for the 13O \u2192 12N + p,W (r) is the Whit-\ntaker function determining the tail of the proton bound-state\nwave function in 13O. We note that \u0007\u03b3 \u223c |M\u03b3 (<) + M\u03b3 (>)|2 is\nthe total radiative width. Also Sf is the spectroscopic factor\nof the configuration 12N + p in the ground state of 13O. The\ninternal part is model dependent. It was estimated using the\nsingle-particle 13O \u2192 12N + p model. The channel part is\nmodel-independent because it is contributed by the asymptotic\nterms of the wave functions. The leading asymptotic term of\nthe resonant wave function is also well known. The asymptotic\nbehavior of the radial bound-state wave function is given\nby S1\/2f \u03d5gs(r) \u2248 C W (r)\/r , where C is the proton removal\nANC of the ground state of 13O and W is the Whittaker\nfunction. Hence, the overall normalization of the channel\npart of the matrix element is governed by the ANC, and\nwe can quite accurately estimate the external part of the\nmatrix element. We find that the dominant contribution to\nthe matrix element comes from the external matrix element,\nhence the sensitivity to the internal contribution is significantly\ndiminished. The calculated total radiative width is \u0007\u03b3 \u2248 3 eV\nfor the channel radius R = 4.25 fm. To check the sensitivity\nof the radiative width to the model parameters, the channel\nradius and spectroscopic factor were varied. We find that\n\u0007\u03b3 = 2.63 eV for R = 4.5 fm and Sf = 0.675 and \u0007\u03b3 =\n3.32 eV for R = 4.0 fm and Sf = 0.825. The adopted value\nwas \u0007\u03b3 = 3.00 eV for R = 4.25 fm and Sf = 0.75. Because\nthe ANC has a very small uncertainty this estimation of the\nradiative width is quite accurate. We believe that the slightly\nhigher result obtained in the second method is related to\nthe different asymptotic behavior of the shell-model wave\nfunction compared with the correct asymptotic terms used in\nthe second method. Both methods give a radiative width that\nis significantly larger than the 24 meV used in Ref. [6].\nThe astrophysical S factor for the radiative capture\n12N(p, \u03b3 )13O is dominated by the resonant capture to the\nground state proceeding through the first 1\/2+ resonance\nand by direct capture to the ground state. The amplitudes\nof the resonant and direct captures do interfere. Due to the\nsmall proton binding energy in the ground state of 13O, the\ndirect capture amplitude is entirely peripheral and its sign is\ndetermined by the ANC [15,16]. The resonant radiative capture\namplitude can be split into internal and channel (external)\nparts. The sign of the external part is determined by the sign of\nM\u03b3 (>), i.e., by the ANC. Hence the relative sign of the resonant\nchannel amplitude and the direct capture amplitude is well\ndetermined and it is positive for the case under consideration,\nfor energies below the first resonance. The sign of the\ninternal part is not known and can be determined only from\nmicroscopic-model calculations. However, the contribution\nfrom the internal part is smaller than that of the channel part due\nto the node in the resonant wave function. As a result, the total\ninterference pattern is entirely determined by the interference\nof the resonant channel and direct capture amplitudes, which\nis constructive at energies below the first resonance [15,16].\nThe results of the calculation of the astrophysical factor\nand reaction rates are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. To determine the\nuncertainty of the calculated astrophysical factor we varied\nthe channel radius from R = 4.0 fm to R = 4.5 fm with\nthe adopted value of R = 4.25 fm. The spectroscopic factor\nvaried from Sf = 0.675 to Sf = 0.825 with the adopted value\nSf = 0.75.\nThe astrophysical reaction rates for the coherent sum of\nnonresonant capture and the first resonance was calculated\n024607-5\nB.

[15]. Our revised reaction\nrate for 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O implies that it will compete successfully\nwith \u03b2+ decay at lower densities than previously believed.\nFigure 7 shows the temperature regime of the former [6] and\npresent calculations.\nV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, we found that the first excited state of 13O\nis at an excitation energy of 2.69 \u00b1 0.05 MeV and has a\nwidth of 350\u2013550 keV. We assigned a spin-parity of 1\/2+\nto this state on the basis of the shape of the resonance, the\nabsolute value of the cross section, and the strong isotopic\nshift. The experimental data suggest a second excited state\nin 13O at 3.29 \u00b1 0.05 MeV with a tentative spin-parity\nassignment of 1\/2\u2212 or 3\/2\u2212 and a width of \u223c75 keV. Another\nmeasurement with higher statistics is required to verify this\nresult. Shell-model calculations [18] lead to the conclusion that\nFIG. 7. The temperature and density conditions where the\n12N(p,\u03b3 ) reaction is important. The region between two solid line\n(new results with uncertainty) and dashed line (from Ref. [6]) show\nwhere the rates for 12N proton capture and beta decay of 12N will be\nequal. In addition, the density should be above the dashed-dotted line\nto produce 13O faster than it can be photo-dissociated.\nthe negative-parity states (1\/2\u2212, 3\/2\u2212) in 13B should occur at\nan excitation energy of around 4 MeV. The state we observed\nat 3.29 MeV may well be the mirror of one of these levels.\nAn important role in the descent of the 1\/2+ state could be\nplayed by a diffuse nuclear potential, which makes the state\nbroader as well. More exact measurements of the width of\nthe 1\/2+ state will be important for making a choice between\nconventional and diffuse potentials in the description of single-\nparticle states in light drip-line nuclei. Our revised reaction rate\nfor 12N(p,\u03b3 )13O implies that it will compete with \u03b2+ decay\nand photodisintegration of 12N at stellar densities lower than\npreviously believed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation under Grant Numbers PHY04-57120, PHY04-56463\nand PHY03-54828 and the U.S. Department of Energy under\nGrant Number DE-FG02-93ER40773.\n[1] F.
