In the romantic \napproach, the researcher looks up at the object of research in order to look down; in \nthe baroque approach, s\/he looks down at it in order to look up. Van Wezemael, \ntherefore, following Kwa, defines the approaches in terms of a metaphor, which \nencompasses two distinct issues: that of the scale of the research and that of the \nperspective of the researcher. Scale is most commonly understood as the ratio of \nrepresentation to object (\u2018larger scale\u2019, for example, means larger size of the \nrepresentation in relation to what it represents). \u2018Looking up to look down\u2019 then \nsuggests that the researcher is looking at a larger (and complex) object (e.g. \u2018society \nas a whole\u2019), but their representations of that object are \u2018small\u2019 (in the sense of being \nsimple or lacking complexity). It suggests further that their aim is to reduce the \ncomplexity of the object to achieve conformity with their representation of it. \nRomantics therefore combine research on a smaller scale (arguably infinitely small, in \nthat the object is infinitely larger than its representation) with an idealist ontological \nand\/or subjectivist epistemological perspective. \n \nIn contrast, \u2018looking down to look up\u2019 operates on a larger scale because the \nrepresentations it seeks to develop are more detailed (\u2018larger\u2019 than romantic \nrepresentations) and the objects of its research tend to be smaller (e.g. specific \norganisations). Further, this approach aims to be \u2018grounded\u2019 in its research objects in \norder to make sense of how they work. Baroque researchers therefore combine \nresearch on a larger scale with a realist ontological and\/or objectivist epistemological \nperspective. \n \nDistinguishing scale from perspective suggests the possibility of other approaches to \nsocial complexity. One example would be \u2018looking up to look out\u2019, where the \nresearcher focuses on a larger object but attempts also to extend their representations, \nusing a variety of methods (e.g. hypothesis formation and deductivism). Another \nexample would be \u2018looking down to look in\u2019, where the researcher investigates \nsmaller objects, to gain deeper insight into interconnections (e.g. through use of \nethnographic methods). Another approach altogether would be non-scalar and non-\nrepresentational, in which understanding grows through performance by actors in \ncomplex fluid networks (Thrift, 2007) \u2013 acting rather than looking. \n \nOverall, it seems to me that van Wezemael is arguing for medium-range theorising, \nrejecting grand narratives on one hand and positivism on the other. If so, it would be \nrelevant to consider more explicitly approaches such as grounded theory, neo-\ninstitutionalism, actor network theory and what Bo Bengtsson and I previously termed \n\u2018contextualised rational action\u2019 (Bengtsson and Somerville, 2002). Crudely speaking, \nthese represent different ways of \u2018looking up and looking down\u2019, i.e. approaches that \ncut across different scales.  \n \nI agree with van Wezemael that a Weberian approach, involving the construction of \nideal types, followed by empirical investigation, identifying deviances from the ideal \ntypes, and leading to improved typologies, is too romantic. It is not clear to me, \nhowever, how far his own approach succeeds in improving on this. He still aims to \n\u2018reduce complexity\u2019, for example, and this looks like a romantic project rather than a \nbaroque one, as it involves abstraction and homogenisation (Can complexity actually \nbe reduced, anyway? Isn\u2019t it a matter of discovering what Gribbin, 2004, has called \n\u2018deep simplicity\u2019 in the phenomena, whether these be natural or social or abstract?). \nThe romantic conception of an abstract and homogenised global order or system is \nreplaced by what looks like an equally abstract and homogenised concept of local \norder. The key concept of an assemblage (as a synthesis of entities on a \u2018lower\u2019 \nscaleTPF1FPT), introduced to make sense of this order, seems indeed to be a classic case of \nabstraction and homogenisation \u2013 and on a larger scale than in traditional romantic \naccounts. \n \nVan Wezemael is conscious, however, that DeLanda\u2019s theory of assemblages does not \ndeal effectively with power relations (or with social causation or relations of \ncontingent obligation, for that matter), and makes two attempts to improve on it. First, \nhe interprets virtualities (understood as whatever can happen) as Weberian ideal \ntypes, which reinforces the tendency to Weberian romanticism and yet also reads very \nlike a neo-institutionalist position (e.g. concepts of resource dependency, \norganisational practice, etc). Second, he argues that linguistic interventions play a key \nrole in moving assemblages in one direction or another, which seems to imply an \nidealist theory of power that conflicts with the realist orientation implicit in much of \nthe rest of the paper. So neither of these attempts succeeds in making the theory seem \nconvincing or useful (e.g. in comparison with the medium-range theories mentioned \nabove).  \n \nThe overall result of van Wezemael\u2019s arguments appears to be a neo-Weberian form \nof neo-institutionalism whose concepts are in need of considerable development, \nexplication and clarification if they are to act as an effective new guide for research \ninto social complexity. \n \nReferences \n \nBengtsson, B. and Somerville, P.
