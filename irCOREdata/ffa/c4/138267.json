The anode metal corrodes and in doing so discharges an electrical\ncurrent to the pipeline.\nWater cut is the percentage by volume of water contained in the crude oil and water mixture.\nIntroduction\nLeakages from pipelines occur frequently and are tolerated in Nigeria despite its economy\ndepending predominantly on the revenue gained from the sale of crude oil and related\nproducts, which are usually transported using such pipeline networks. The leakages are\ncaused primarily by corrosion [1] as a result of the exposure of the inner surface of the\npipeline to water. However, corrosion of the external surfaces of pipelines also occurs\nbecause of the exposure to their external environment. Such external coatings form an\ninsulating layer over the metallic surfaces. Each coating isolates the metal from direct\ncontact with the surrounding corrosive electrolyte, e.g. soil or sea water. It interposes a high\nelectrical resistance, such that the electrochemical reactions cannot readily occur.\nHowever, such coatings, when inappropriately applied, may contain holes (referred to as\n\u201cholidays\u201d), which act as corrosion initiation sites. Holidays in coatings may also develop,\nwhile the pipeline is in service, as a result of degradation of the coating by either a harsh\nenvironment, soil stresses, relative movement of the pipe with respect to the surrounding\nground and or other defects not related to pipeline construction [2].\nModern coatings permit the use of a low current-density (CD) (of less than 0.01 mA\/m2 ) for\nthe effective cathodic-protection (CP) of the external surface of a pipeline[3] to ensure that\nexternal corrosion is drastically reduced. The present investigation is focused on ensuring\nadequate protection of the external surface of the pipeline against external corrosion during\nthe construction stage of a pipeline network. Modern underground pipelines tend now to be\ndesigned with protective coatings, supplemented by CP systems to protect the pipelines\nagainst external corrosion [4]. The two categories of CP are the impressed-current system\nand the sacrificial-anode system.\nSacrificial (or Galvanic) Anode CP System\nThis is accomplished by connecting a metal (Zn or Mg) anode to each section of the\nunderground pipeline. The anode will corrode and, in so doing, will discharge an electric\ncurrent to the pipeline. (The current output of such a galvanic anode installation is typically\nmuch less than that which is obtained from an impressed-current CP system). In low-\nresistivity environments (e.g. marine or swamp locations), typical current outputs for a 40kg\n4Mg anode, at an efficiency of 70%, range from 50 to100 milliamps. (An impressed current\nsystem can generate as much as 60amps depending on the design and operating\nrequirements).\nGalvanic-anode installations are used mostly on underground structures, where CP current\nrequirements are relatively small and where the soil resistivity is low, say less than 10,000\nohm-cm [5]. The galvanic anode system is self powered and does not require an external\npower-source. When the current requirement is small (i.e. below 500 milliamps), a galvanic\nsystem is more economic than an impressed-current system.\nImpressed-current CP system\nThis is commonly used in the oil and natural-gas industry: it is more effective than the\nsacrificial anode system and the preferred means for protecting buried cross-country\npipelines. An external current source (usually a DC source) powers a grounded anode, from\nwhich current flows through the earth to the pipeline\u2019s external-surface, sometimes over\nappreciable distances, thus eliminating all corrosion otherwise occuring on the pipeline\u2019s\nexternal metallic surface. This practice is usually carried out as a statutory supplement,\nafter applying a protective coating on the pipe\u2019s surface.\nA variety of factors affect the effectiveness of an ICCP system: soil resistivity, coating\nmaterial, choice of power source and current requirements are influencial. Generally, ICCP\nsystems are used to protect large bare and coated structures in the presence of high-\nresistivity electrolytes. The design of an IC system must take into account the likelihood of\ncoating damage occurring and the possibility of creating stray currents, which may\nadversely affect other structures. A typical IC system is made up of a power source,\ntransformer rectifier, ground-bed, cables and junction boxes.\nLiterature Review\nKrause[6] identified corrosion as the deterioration of a material (usually a metal) as a result\nof its reaction with its environment. Corrosion is inevitable in our ambient environment and\nconstitutes a major problem for the crude-oil and natural-gas industry and pipeline\noperators. The rate of corrosion can be controlled by the use of protective coatings, CP as\nwell as the choice of appropriate materials for the pipeline and\/or corrosion inhibitors.\n5Installing an effective protection system is deemed to be highly economic and constitutes\nonly about 1% of total project cost for the pipeline.\nBird [7], using the Saudi Arabian Oil-Company experience, reviewed the external corrosion\nof two 22-year old commissioned pipelines crossing the Arabian desert. External corrosion\nprotection was an applied tape-wrap, supplemented by an ICCP system, which was\nimplemented after both pipelines were commissioned. No mention was made of maintaining\nthe technical integrity of the new pipeline against external corrosion during the construction\nperiod. Anene [8] concluded that increasing the wall thickness is not a recommended\nsolution for an integrity problem as the pipeline will continue to corrode until a CP system is\ninstalled. Operating a commissioned pipeline, with effective external CP, will result in\nconsiderable cost savings in life-time maintenance and an overall reduction in\nenvironmental and health hazards associated with leaks that would have occurred resulting\nfrom external corrosion of the pipeline.\nThe use of an expensive alloy as the material of a pipeline(in order to inhibit its corrosion) is\nuneconomic [9]. Eliassen and Hesjerik [10] concluded that, for most pipelines buried in\nhigh-resisitivity soil, the CP current demand is high. However the pipeline\u2019s integrity can be\nthreatened by severe interference problems, e.g. arising from the presence locally of a\ndirect current for a local electric railway. (For operational pipelines, the external corrosion\nrisks are generally dependent on the anodic-current densities). Also, alternating current\ninterference from near-by high-power transmission lines can be a major source of a\npipeline\u2019s external corrosion. Hence, careful pipeline-route selection is important.\nOn-line monitoring of the CP system, for all operational pipelines, will identify zones of likely\nproblems for implemenation or remedial actions and so probably reduce the rate of a\npipeline\u2019s leaks due to external corrosion[10]. Secondly, corrosion-integrity management,\nfor each operating pipeline, should ensure a safer and more reliable operation as well as\nimproved safety for the public and the company\u2019s operational staff. All faults and\nabnormalities should be reported immediately. Prompt repairs to all identified damaged\ncoatings are recommended in order to ensure the on-going effectiveness of the protection\nsystem.\nPipelines are generally designed with an expected minimum service life of 25 years [11]. So\nin order to survive the harsh underground surroundings in which these pipelines are laid,\n6they should be protected from external corrosion by appropriate coatings and\nsupplemented with CP systems. The coatings must be tough and adhere well to the pipes\u2019\nexternal surfaces, while CP is generally achieved via an IC system applied after pipeline\ncommissioning in order to maintain the pipeline\u2019s technical integrity. The IC system is\nrecommended for operational pipelines and should be designed in accordance with NACE\nRP0169-2002 [12]. However, little or no consideration is at present given to the deterioating\nintegrity of pipelines during assembly in Nigeria, despite the often long unexpected delays\nduring this construction period. The provision of a protective system for a pipeline\nthroughout this construction stage is desirable.\nThe problem\nA pipeline with an external protective coating and supplemented by a CP system is\nregarded as fully guarded against external corrosion provided the installed CP system\ndelivers a protective potential of at least 850mV for a saturated copper\/copper sulphate\nelectrode contacting the electrolyte. Measurement of the defence achieved is undertaken\nafter specified time intervals in accordance with regulations issued by the Directorate of\nPetroleum Resources (DPR) [13].\nThe CP system\u2019s voltage-drops must be measured across the pipeline-to-soil interface to\nensure a valid indication. The procedure pertinent to overall maintenancel involves:-\n\uf0d8 Measuring or calculating the voltage drop(s).\n\uf0d8 Reviewing the previous performance of the CP system.\n\uf0d8 Evaluating the physical and electrical characteristics of the pipeline and its\nenvironment.\n\uf0d8 Determining, through regular checks, whether or not there is evidence of\ncorrosion.\nBefore the present investigation, no one in Nigeria had focused on protecting pipelines\nwhich subsequently are to be buried, during the construction period prior to commissioning.\nThe project life cycle\nThe model in Figure 1 shows the complete project-cycle which consists of five main phases\n[14], and should help direct attention to achieving pipeline integrity before commissioning.\n7Figure1 The project\u2019s life-cycle.\nWe shall focus on the problems of the technical integrity of new pipelines due to external\ncorrosion during the construction period. In previous studies, it has been assumed that\nexternal corrosion of the pipeline will only commence after pipeline commissioning, but, in\nreality, relatively rapid external corrosion is initiated immediately the steel pipeline is placed\nin contact with the soil during the pipeline\u2019s assembly [15].\nSolution to the identified problem\nEach CP system is usually designed and installed after commissioning the pipeline. Then,\nthe system is balanced to deliver the required minimum protection potential of -850mV for\nthe effective defence of the new pipeline. Thereafter schemed monitoring, inspection and\nmaintenance of the installed system is desirable to ensure the effective protection of the\npipeline against external corrosion[16].\nInterference may occur between pipelines or other metallic installations, for instance,\npipelines or metallic structures, that are not protected, carry currents when they are within\nthe electric field of a CP system and will discharge these currents back to the protected\npipeline. This may result in an accelerated external-corrosion attack at the point of current\nIDENTIFY&\nASSESS\nPROJECT\nINITIATION\nFEASIBILITY\nOPERATESELECT\nBASIS FOR\nDEIGN\nPROJECT\nSPECIFICATI\nON\nDEFINE EXECUTE\nCONCEPT\nSELECTION\nOPERATE\nMAINTAIN\nDETAILED\nDESIGN\nCONSTRUC\nTION\nCOMMISSIO\nN\/\nSTART UP\nHANDOVER\nABANDON\n8discharge on the protected pipeline. This problem is solved by shielding the pipeline or by\ninstalling electric bonds between the pipelines. Generally, interference problems are most\nsevere in high-resistivity soil [17].\nEconomic justification for Cathodic Protection\nIt is usually cost effective to justify the adoption of CP system, i.e. it is far cheaper in the\nlong term, to install a properly designed CP system on a pipeline network than have to\nlocate and repair pipeline leaks. Installation of CP systems has considerably extended the\noperational lives of pipeline networks, while operating the pipelines within their safe design\nenvelopes. For cases where a comparison has been made between installing a CP system\non a new pipeline rather than increasing the wall thickness through an additional corrosion\nallowance, it can be seen that the cost of the additional wall thickness far exceeds the cost\nof installing the appropriate CP system. Furthermore, the pipeline, even with the extra wall\nthickness, but without CP system will corrode and reach a state when provision of CP is the\nonly option to avoid external corrosion induced leaks [5].\nThe costs of corrosion management after pipeline commissioning, in Australia, the United\nKingdom, Japan and several other advanced countries, are about 3 \u2192 4% of the gross \nnational product (GNP). In the USA, the result of a similar study at the request of the\nAmerican Congress showed that the cost of all corrosion management is about 4.2% of the\nGNP or $180 billion per year: this is a combination of both direct and indirect costs after\npipeline commissioning. This figure is actually higher because external corrosion\ncommences from the start of construction. The situation is probably worse in Nigeria\nbecause of the particularly aggressive environments and working practice that are\nineffectve.\nPipeline design\nCP should not be regarded as an alternative to external coating, but rather as\nsupplementary to ensure protection against external corrosion.\nThe following data are used as the basis for the design (BFD) in the present pipeline\nproject:\nDaily production-rate of crude-oil : 60,000 bpd\nRelative density of crude-oil : 0.8207\nKinematic viscosity of crude-oil : 2.04 cSt\nDynamic viscosity of crude-oil : 1.67 cP\n9Pipeline surface roughness ; 0.025mm\nTemperature of flowing crude-oil : 400C max.\nDesign pressure : 1100 psig (76 bar)\nDepth of ground cover : 0.90m\nDesign life : 25 years\nAnnual corrosion rate of pipeline : 0.1mm\/yr\nWater content of soil : 30% average\nAmbient temperature : 180C minimum ; 350C maximum\nHydraulics and Mechanical Design.\nPipe diameter\nFor all cross-country buried pipelines, the conveyed liquid\u2019s recommended speed lies\nbetween 0.5m\/s and 5m\/s. The design speed for crude oil within the Obigbo-North pipeline\nin Nigeria was recommended to be in the range of 0.7 to 2.43 m\/s. For this pipeline design,\ncalculations, the upper value of 2.43 m\/s was chosen.\nThe piping diameter can be is determined [18] using the equation\nV = (0.0119 x BPD) \/ D2 (1)\nwhere V = Flow speed = 2.43 m\/s\nQ = Production flow rate = 60,000 bpd\nD = Pipe diameter\nTherefore, D = 0.254m\nReynolds number (Re)\nThe Reynolds number provides an indication of the flow regime expected in the pipeline\nnetwork while in operation and is given by:\nRe =\n\uf075\uf06d\n\uf072 ii VdVd \uf03d (2)\nwhere \uf072 = density of crude oil = 0.8207kg\/m3\ndi = internal diameter of pipe = 0.254m\n\uf06e = kinematic viscosity = 2.05 x 10-6 cSt\nIf Re < 2300, the flow is laminar and if Re >4000, the flow is fully turbulent [19].\nThe Reynolds number for this flow in this pipeline is given by:\nRe = 2.43 x 0.8207x 0.254 = 303\n1.67x 10-3\nHence, the flow is laminar.\n10\nFriction Factor(f)\nThis can be determined [20] from\nf = 0.0072 + 0.636\/Re 0.355 (3)\nThus, the friction factor for this flow in this pipeline is given by:\nf = 0.0072 + 0.636\/(303) 0.355 = 0.804\nWall thickness\nThis is a critical factor with respect to the useful life of the pipeline. Its wall thickness, t\nshould be dictated mainly by the internal pressure to which it is subjected and is given by\nthe modified Barlow\u2019s equation [21] for circumferential stress as:\nt = (P x D) \/ (2 x F x SMYS x E) (4)\nThus, t = (1100 x 10.75) \/ (2 x 0.6 x 52000 x 1 ) = 4.83mm\nBased on ASME 31.4 [21], tm = t + c\nAssuming a design life of 25 years and corrosion rate of 0.1mm\/year,\nc = 0.1mm\/yr x 25 yrs = 2.5mm\nTherefore tm = 7.37mm\nThe closest commercially available size is 7.62mm.\nThus the 0.254m schedule 30 piping class was selected for the pipeline.\nReduced project life-cycle\nThe design life of most pipelines is 25 years under the specified design-conditions. The\nchallenge is to develop a maintenance programme, which will ensure that this criterion is\nsatisfied. The present analysis of pipeline defects indicates that most external corrosion\nfailures were initiated during the pipeline\u2019s construction period due to a lack then of effective\nprotection.\nImplementation of solution\nIt is clear that present design and construction practice do not guarantee effective\nprotection of pipelines during assembly. There is therefore a challenge to find a solution\nthat will overcome this critical problem for the vast pipeline networks in the Niger Delta Area\nof Nigeria. The degradation implications of current practice of laying steel pipelines (in a\ncorrosive medium) without effective protection against external corrosion is now\nacknowledged. There is an economic justification for protecting the new pipe during pipeline\n11\nlaying and assembly i.e. before, the pipeline is commissioned and a permanent ICCP is\ninstalled. By considering the relevant economics and ease of implementation, various\noptions were considered; the sacrificial (galvanic) anode CP system was the preferred\noption. This system is most suitable for short-term periods of protection to prevent external\ncorrosion. It is effective and will guarantee the required full protection against a pipeline\u2019s\nexternal corrosion during construction. The sacrificial-anode system is very cheap and most\nfavoured compared with the more capital-intensive IC system. Generally, materials for the\nsacrificial-anode are readily available and easily installed, even in difficult terrain. This\nsystem has an economic advantage over the IC system for short duration usage. A typical\nlayout of a sacrificial-anode system is shown in Figure 2.\nDesign details for the sacrificial (galvanic)-anode CP System\nThe 0.254m (diameter) x 12km (length) Obigbo pipeline [20] is detailed below. Magnesium\nand zinc are the two main types of galvanic anode materials used, but the former is more\npopular.\nGenerally, sacrificial (galvanic) anodes are used where the installation is for (i) a short\nperiod, (ii) a small current requirement and (iii) the pipeline is to be in contact with a soil of\nlow resistivity. For effectiveness, the anode material should not be located more than 5m\nfrom the pipeline and must be surrounded by a bentonite\/gypsum mixture.\nThe basic design data for the presently considered system are:\nL = 12 km\nD = 0.254m\nt = 0.036m\nR = 500 ohm-cm\ntc = 5 mm\nI = 0.1 mA\/m2\nV = - 0.670 V\nThe pipeline\u2019s external surface area (A) is given by [18]:\nA = 3.142(D + 2tc)L = 0.9953 x 104 m2 --------------- (5)\n12\nUsing a design current density of 0.1 mA\/m2, then the\nProtection Current (PC) = A x I = 0.9953 A (i.e. approximately 1A)\nFrom the magnesium-anode manufacturer\u2019s data, a 14.5kg high-potential anode should be\n0.5m long and 13 cm in diameter with a potential of -1.75V. The average potential of the\npipeline system is -0.67V.\nHence the net initial driving potential (E) is given by\nE = -1.75V \u2013 ( - 0.67V) = - 1.08V ----------------- (6)\nUsing Dwight\u2019s [ 21] formula for the resistance of a vertical galvanic anode in soil gives\nR = 0.005p\/3.142L[ ln(8L\/d) \u2013 1 ] ohm\/anode -------------- (7)\nwhere p = 500 ohm-cm\nL = 0.5 m\nd = 0.13 m\nHence, R = 0.005 x 500\/3.142 x 0.5 [ ln (8 x 0.5 \/ 0.13) \u2013 1 ] ohm\/anode\n= 3.867 ohm \/ anode.\nBut the maximum output current from each anode is given by;\nImax = E \/ R --------------------------- (8)\n= 1.08 \/ 3.867 A\n= 0.28 A\nThe number of galvanic anodes required to protect the pipeline is given by;\nN = It \/ Ia -------------------------- (9)\nwhere It = Total current required [ 0.9953 A]\nIa = Single anode current [ 0.28A ]\nN = 0.9953 \/ 0.28 anode = 3.55 anodes [ i.e. in practice 4 anodes]\nThis implies that the anodes should be spaced at 3 km intervals.\nBecause the pipeline will be polarised to at least a potential of -0.850V, the net driving force\nof the anodes is given by;\n13\nE = -1.75 V \u2013 (-0.85V) = - 0.90V\nCurrent (I) per anode = 0.9 \/ 3.867 A = 0.23 A\nBecause the magnesium anodes operate at 50% efficiency, the estimated anode life [21] is\ngiven by;\nT = 2\/3Fu x Ca x W\/ I ------------------------- (10)\nwhere Fu = 85%\nCa = 0.125 at 50% efficiency\nW = 14.5 kg\nI = 0.23 Amps\nHence, T = 0.85 x 0.125 x 14.5 \/ 0.23 = 6.7 years\nThus the estimated anode life is taken as 7 years which includes the lag period.\nThe layout of the sacrificial anode is shown in Figure 2.\nField testing of the design\nBoth the sacrificial and the IC systems have proven to be reliable and effective means of\nsecondary protection of underground pipelines against external corrosion. They have been\nused on both old pipelines, storage tanks and steel bridges with desirable results.\nFollowing the findings and recommendations arising from this study, concerning the\ntechnical integrity of new underground pipelines with respect to external corrosion, the\ninstallation of temporary sacrificial anodes was implemented during the construction of the\nnew 20.32mm internal diameter x 10.2km long Agbada pipeline with a 4.26mm wall\nthickness. This new pipeline project started in February 2004 (Q1-2004), construction work\nwas completed in November 2005 and the pipeline fully commissioned by the end of\nDecember 2005.\n14\nThe magnesium galvanic anodes were installed at four positions in accordance with the\ndesign layout shown on Figure 3.\n\uf020\uf020\n0\n12 km\n25.4mm Pipeline\n1.5km 3km 3km 3km 1.5km\nMagnesium\nSacrificial\nAnode\nPACKAGED\nANODES\nANODE HOLE (20.32mm minimum )\nANODE DISTANCE\nBELOW PIPELINE\n(0.9144m)\nPIPELINE\n16mm2 Cu ANODE\nCABLE CONNECTION\nTO PIPELINE\nFigure 2 Schematic of the sacrificial-anode installation on pipeline\n15\nFigure 3 Schemaitc of the distribution of galvanic anodes along the Agbada pipeline (not to scale)\nUltrasonic measurements of the intergrity of the new pipeline\u2019s wall thickness were taken\nevery six months during the construction period up to April 2005 using a calibrated DMS 2\nKrautkramer ultrasonic thickness-gauge, which achieves an accuracy of 95%, i.e. far better\nthan obtained with an intelligent pig dragged through the pipe. At each location where a\nmeasurement is to be made, the pipe is decoated to expose the bare metal and\nsubsequently recoated using polythene tapes after each measurement The locations on a\nvertical section of the pipeline at which the measurement were taken are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4 UT measuring positions\nTables 1 \u2192 3 show the wall-thickness integrity measurements, obtained during the 18\nmonths construction period, using the ultrasonic equipment. The worst defect within the\nmonitoring period was a 0.23% wall loss which corresponds to less than a 1% wall loss for\na five-year period. This clearly confirms that, as a result of the use of a galvanic anode\nsystem the technical integrity of the new pipeline was not affected significantly during the\nconstruction period.\n1.3km 2.5km 2.5k 2.5km 1.4km\nTP 1 TP 2 TP 3 TP 4\nA\nB\nD\nA = 1200 clock position\nB = 300 clock position\nC = 600 clock position\nD= 900 clock position\n\uf0b7\nC\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n16\nTable 1 Wall-thickness measurement ( in mm) March 2004\nLocation A B C D Average NWT Mean % Wall\nThickness loss\nTP 1 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 0\nTP 2 4.26 4.26 4.25 4.26 4.26 4.26 0\nTP 3 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 0\nTP 4 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 4.26 0\nTable 2 Wall-thickness measurements(in mm) September 2004\nA B C D Average NWT Mean % Wall\nThickness loss\nTP 1 4.26 4.26 4.24 4.25 4.253 4.26 0.18\nTP 2 4.26 4.26 4.25 4.25 4.255 4.26 0.12\nTP 3 4.26 4.26 4.25 4.26 4.26 4.26 0.00\nTP 4 4.26 4.25 4.24 4.26 4.253 4.26 0.18\nTable 3 Wall-thickness measurement(in mm) April 2005\nA B C D Average NWT Mean % Wall\nThickness loss\nTP 1 4.25 4.24 4.24 4.24 4.243 4.26 0.23\nTP 2 4.26 4.25 4.25 4.25 4.253 4.26 0.18\nTP 3 4.26 4.26 4.24 4.26 4.255 4.26 0.18\nTP 4 4.25 4.25 4.24 4.25 4.248 4.26 0.20\nInternal Corrosion of Crude-oil Pipelines\nCorrosion of the external surfaces of pipelines is only part of the problem: internal corrosion\nmust also be prevented. After a recent (AD 2004) inspection it was found that up to 70% of\nthe wall thickness (= 9.5mm) of pipeline leading from the USA\u2019s biggest oilfield, at Prudhoe\nBay, Alska, had been removed by microbial bacteria, in the contained crude-oil within the\npipelines. The consequent replacement of 32km of transit pipelines is likely to cost in\n17\nexcess of US $100million. The necessary shutdown of the plant, resulting in 400,000\nbarrels per day not being delivered, represents about USA $7million daily in forgone\nrevenues.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nPoor maintenance practices, leading to reduced operational capabilities, are associated\nwith bad management. However, by good design of systems and services, overall lifetime\nmaintenance costs can be reduced dramatically.\nThe sacrificial anode is a suitable method for the effective external protection of new\npipelines during the construction period, while the IC system will provide such protection\nduring the post-commissioning and the entire service\/operation period of the pipeline. This\nwill ensure that the technical integrity of the new pipeline will be maintained with no\nappreciable wall-corrosion loss both during the construction period and after pipeline\ncommissioning. Implementation of the recommendations arising from this investigation\nshould eliminate current new-pipeline leaks and so benefit all stakeholders and improve the\nsafety of pipeline operations in Nigeria.\nReferences\n1.
