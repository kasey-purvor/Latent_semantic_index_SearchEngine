INTRODUCTION\nThe simultaneous measurement of the optical emission\nfrom collocated fluorochromes is a common problem in bi-\nology. Imaging cell components demands the temporal reg-\nistration of multiple fluorescent markers such as variants of\ngreen fluorescent protein ~GFP!. In fluorescent resonant en-\nergy transfer ~FRET!, changes in emission spectra indicate\nthe physical separation between donor and acceptor dye mol-\necules. Quantifying the hybridization of labeled nucleic acids\n~probes! to immobilized target molecules in microarray for-\nmat or in cells in situ ideally requires the efficient, artifact-\nfree measurement of several fluorescent spectra\nsimultaneously.1 Cryogenically cooled superconducting tun-\nnel junction ~STJ! detectors2\u20136 developed for astronomy\nmeasure the energies of individual optical photons with very\nlow levels of internal background. The operation of a STJ is\nindicated schematically in Fig. 1~a!. In this article, we show\nthat STJs can be used for the sensitive, quantitative registra-\ntion of multiple biological fluorochromes. Using a single\nnear-UV excitation filter, and standard dichroic and long-\npass filters, the emission spectra of common fluorochromes\ncould be easily distinguished\u2014from each other and from\nbroadband substrate fluorescence. STJ detectors have the po-\ntential to revolutionize quantitative multifluorochrome imag-\ning in biology.\nPhotomultiplier tubes ~PMTs! and image intensifiers are\nthe photon-counting detectors most commonly used to image\nweakly fluorescent biological specimens.

MEASUREMENTS\nThe detector used in our initial study of biological fluo-\nrescence was a single 30330 mm2 STJ with 100 nm thick Ta\nlayers and 30 nm thick Al layers on either side of the tunnel\nbarrier. The transition temperature for bulk tantalum is 4.5 K\nand the energy gap D~0! is 0.69 meV. The detector was made\nusing photolithographic techniques from a Ta\/Al multilayer\ndeposited on a polished sapphire substrate. The low leakage\ncurrent ~,0.1 pA\/mm2! gave a negligible contribution to the\nbaseline noise floor, while the high transmission of the bar-\nrier resulted in high signal amplitudes. The detector had a\nresponsivity ^n&N0;40 000 tunneled electrons per eV of\nphoton energy, and a pulse decay time of ;20 ms.

We would then expect the dominant background\nFIG. 1. ~a! Schematic representation of single pixel STJ.

The STJ quantum efficiency exceeds 50% for l values\nbetween 150 and 700 nm. No efforts were made to focus the\nlight from the specimen onto the fiber or from the end of the\nfiber onto the detector. The coupling efficiency was therefore\nextremely low ~,0.01%!. The detector was held within a\nlight tight shield at the base system temperature of 300 mK.\nThe warm end of the optical fiber, however, constitutes a 300\nK black body source which, when convolved with the fiber\ntransmission, provides an effective reference signal in all\nSTJ spectra at a wavelength of 2 mm ~see Figs. 2 and 4!.\nThe warm readout electronics consisted of a charge sen-\nsitive preamplifier situated ;1 m from the detector, a shap-\ning amplifier ~10 ms shaping time! and an analog to digital\n~AD! converter whose output was optically coupled to a PC,\non which the pulse amplitude and decay time was recorded\nfor each detected photon. A pulse risetime window was ap-\nplied to select valid events.\nFluorescence spectra were measured from eleven differ-\nent, commercially available, labeled uridine nucleotides. Six\ndifferent substrates were also examined. Four excitation fil-\nters were used: the spectra presented here were obtained with\nthe following two filter sets:\n~i!

The quadrature sum\nof tunnel limit and electronic noise contributions then im-\nplies a 2 mm resolving power R55.7, slightly better than\nobserved.\nFor each fluorochrome, the microscope focus was ad-\njusted to produce an output count rate of 800 Hz\u2014the maxi-\nmum rate before pulse pileup compromised the spectral reso-\nlution. The \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 count rate obtained by closing the\nmicroscope shutter between bulb and filter was 0.09 s21.\nBecause individual spectra were not obtained at constant in-\ntensity, overlaying two STJ spectra does not necessarily rep-\nresent the degree of spectral separation for the corresponding\nmixture of fluorochromes. Nevertheless, Fig. 3 indicates that,\nwhile the degree of spectral overlap is significant, it is\nstraightforward to deconvolve the relative intensity contribu-\ntions of mixed Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 probes. We note that\nthe peak emission energies and spectral widths for both\nprobes differ significantly from the templates published by\nthe manufacturer.12 The peak emission energy for Alexa 594\nis redshifted by 0.17 eV from the expected value of 2.088\neV; that of Alexa 488, by 0.29 eV. The measured width of the\nAlexa 594 distribution is somewhat larger than obtained\nfrom the convolution of the manufacturer\u2019s spectrum with\nthe energy response of the STJ. Since the STJ calibration\nrules out any \u2018\u2018zero shift\u2019\u2019 in the detector response ~see Fig.\n4!, we conclude that these measurements constitute evidence\nfor the influence of local environment on fluorochrome emis-Downloaded 30 May 2007 to 143.210.120.193.

We cannot attribute the excess intensity at\nlower energies to the presence in the sample of unhybridized\nDNA, since the intrinsic fluorescence of DNA is well known\nto peak in the UV. One explanation is excimer ~excited\ndimer! emission arising as a result of the high concentrations\nof the fluorochrome probes in the sample, although fluores-\ncence from components of the solutions used to prepare the\narray may also be contributing. The manufacturer\u2019s hand-\nbook for Bodipy dyes states that these fatty acid analogs do\ngenerally exhibit concentration-dependent excimer formation\nand consequent redshifting of their fluorescence.12\nIV.
