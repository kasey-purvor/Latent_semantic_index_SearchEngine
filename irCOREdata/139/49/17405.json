When not entirely swept up  in the \nwhirlwind of pragmatic existence, progressives have been consecrating their \ncreative and political energies to the struggle with metaphysical identities and \nthe limits imposed by heterosexist culture, while recourse to the divine has \nlargely been the preserve of conservatives clinging defensively to the certain- \nties of a guaranteed order. Analogies with Heidegger\u2019s ontological  need come \nto mind, with its seeming superfluousness at a time of rapid change and \nimminent crisis.  Yet, since Sexes et parent\u00e9s, \u2019 the need for the divine has \noccupied a pivotal if not central role in Egaray\u2019s philosophy, as she attempts \nto envisage a beyond to the confines of patriarchy and, indeed, to envisage an \nethics of sexual difference.  Here I will attempt a mere general outline of \nmight function to release relations between women fiom a purely moral \nhorizon. By extension, women might be released from their social role as the \nmoral guardians of unethical societies. \nIrigaray\u2019s divine matter is to be  compared with two other forms of \nmaterialism: historical materialism and Bataille\u2019s Nietzschean libidinal mate- \nrialism, the one predicting the death of God, the other declaring it a fait \naccompli.2  The one leading to the reduction of man to a means, the other \nleading to the violent negation of man.  Historical materialism might be \nconstrued  as  having no outside in its circle of material as always already social, \nand Bataille\u2019s general economy of base materialism might be said to have no \ninside as energy flows ineluctably towards its own expenditure, all excess. \nThe divine matter of irigaray depends simultaneously on the need for an \noutside and an inside; it is both within and without. It is unashamedly positive, \nI  Irigaray\u2019s position; I contend that her divine is both very material and one that \n1  Paris, 1987. \n2  I do not have the space to  fully develop this comparison here, alihough it does inform this \nPaper. Luce Irigaray and divine matter  133 \nin that it expresses her desire to go beyond pure negation in order to avoid the \npolitics of simply making demands, since Irigaray insists that slavery is not \novercome by the mere defeat of the masten3 Of course, any such positivity \nrisks accusations of collusion of some sort, risks some colonising assimilation. \nIt would be  vain to attempt to exempt Irigaray from such criticism, for \nacceptance of her analysis and its solutions does inevitably entail such risks. \nHowever, suspending cynicism for a moment, the following considerations \nshould be borne in mind.  Irigaray is not engaged in an exercise of transcen- \ndental idealism; she has no privileged access to truth and is as  hermeneutically \nsituated as her critics. She is not claiming to represent woman or women, nor \nplay the role of prophet, mediating between divine will and the popular mass. \nShe is less concerned with stating what the divine is (or should be) than with \nsetting out the structurai possibility or necessity of the divine; she is more \nconcerned to elaborate the ontological possibility of the divine as an existen- \ntial-hermeneutic  condition,  than to list its features  as  if it were a being, ontically \nconceived. That said, as  this divine is not mystical, she does on occasion offer \nways of interpreting, appropriating and creating it,  at least for the female \ndivine!  This  because I believe that she, more than anyone, is aware of how \nstrange a conception it is, not only because we have rationalised God out of \nany credible discourse  (except as  a logical buttress for a given system in which \naffective needs are deemed to be misplaced), but because the female divine \nhas been outlawed in monotheistic cultures and tends to evoke images of \nweekend Mother Earth cults-await  the ensuing outburst of laughter at such \nan incomprehensible absurdity. \n3  In her most recent work, J\u2019uime \u00e0 toi, Park, 1992, Irigaray continues to  develop what she \nsees as  the ihiid stage of her oeuvre, that is, to  examine the possibility for relations between \nthe  male and  female sexes (the first  stage being a critique of patriarchy, the  second  an \nexploration of  fefiminin).  She signais  her interest in Hegel and attempts to  develop adialectic \nfor the  two sexes.  Thus, any positivity will be mediated by  the  labour of the  negative, \nreworked by Irigaray as \u2018e  limit gender represents.. \nFor example, her discussions of women\u2019s nght to vuginity and to motherhood are more than \njust legalistic strategies; they offer valorised ideals for women.  See \u2018Pourquoi defuiir des \ndroits sexu\u00e9s?\u2019inJe, tu, nom, Paris, 1990,101-15. \n4 134  Alison Martin \nThe structural basis of Irigaray\u2019s argument is appropriated from Feuerbach\u2019s \nThe Essence of Chri~tianity,~  hence it is firmly rooted in dialectical thought \nand in his insistence that man has both an inner and an outer life.  Yet she \ndisplaces the terms of this within and without from Feuerbach\u2019s sensuous \nmaterialism and his generic notion of species being (genre) to an elemental \nmaterialism and an insistence upon genre as gender. \nReligious consciousness, then, is taken as the paradigm of human con- \nsciousness. \u2018Consciousness in the strictest sense is present only in a being to \nwhom his species, his essential nature, is an object of thought\u2019, writes Feuer- \nbach (Essence, 1). Human consciousness is one that objectifies its own nature \nas an  object of thought, enabling it to be both self-reflectively self-conscious \nand to constitute other things or beings similarly as objects. This  process, for \nFeuerbach, derives not from the self-differentiation  of the concept in Hegelian \nterms, such that the other is an  ideal construction on the flip-side of the same \nconcept, but rather from the existential duality of real existent beings. It does \nnot originate in some scientific or rationalistic understanding, then, but in a \nconsciousness that has always manifested itself in and through religion, in the \nessence of man as will and affection, or in his needs deriving from the reality \nof his sensuous materialism, which give rise to the feeling that sustains \nreligious belief. Such experience becomes uniquely human when recognized \nas that of a true other who is nevertheless the same as the self, so that man\u2019s \nsubjective affectivity acquires an objective form via the other; man is simul- \ntaneously \u2018I\u2019and \u2018Thou\u2019. By such a recognition,  man is constituted  as  a species \nbeing or genre, which both forms collective identity and enables individuality \nto emerge in that it is the universal facilitating the factor of differentiation. It \nis by no means a universal transcending space and time, for man as a species \nbeing has evolved historically according to the nature of his religious projec- \ntions, of the divine he has made of his objectivity in a given era.  But it is \ntranscendent and infinite, for while the supernatural quality attributed to this \nobjectivity has often deluded man into believing that his outside is totally other \nto himself (when a non-alienated  conception  would realize that man is the only \n5  Trans.  George Eliot, New York, 1957. Luce Irigaray and divine matter  135 \ntrue source of his own divine), his objectivity has to be infinite to enable him \nto realize his finitude.  Without the projection of a perfection as a collective \naffirmation, man as  such could not exist; no subjectivity or society has existed \nwithout divine assistance. \nNo wonder, then, Irigaray argues, that woman struggles to define herself \nas such, that she has neither subjectivity nor objectivity.  For woman has no \nGod, no divine, no goal.  Without a God, what becomes of her will?  To the \nextent that it can be said to be hers at all, it is a kind of amorphous meandering, \nat best a passive nihilism, for not even affirmative  nihilism is possible for those \nwith no God to destroy. Her will, such as it is, is tied to the will of the other, \nwhich because totally other, not from within her at all, leads to her subjection \nand alienation in external goals (whether in the form of man, child or social \nduty). And it is pertinent to ask, I believe, if this lack of an objective outside \nappropriate to the will of women does in fact leave them in a chasm where \nwills shoot out and deflect off one another in seemingly random fashion so \nthat  the  only way  to  seek to  grasp and  comprehend them  seems to  be \nindividually,  consequently in terms of morality alone. The search and specu- \nlation is endless, however, if the individuality  in question does indeed turn out \nto be a black hole. \nThe problem, according to irigaray, gravitates around the fact that man \nhas defined himself with reference to his own genre, and in so doing believed \nhis divine to be representative of the whole of the genre humain. Hence the \nlogos is given to be neuter, or as the masculine generic,  just as, she argues the \nU(s) functions in language.\u2019  Should  the question of sexual difference be raised, \nthen the neutrality of-this representation is thrown into doubt, as when, for \nexample, a woman wishes to represent the divine and to speak the word of the \ndivine during the Christian sacraments. Ifthe universal nature ofthe masculine \nis then invoked, she must attempt to embody his words, but even that has \nproved an unacceptable image of incarnation until very recently, when the \nrationalised religion has finally begun to accept the logic of its own rationalism \n6 \n6 \n7 \nSee \u2018Femmes divines\u2019 in Saa,  67-85. \nThroughout her work, bui for a summary see, Je, fu, nous. 136  Alison Martin \n(albeit reluctantly).  Yet  what  do such reforms amount to  in  terms of a \nphilosophy such as Irigaray\u2019s? An equalisation to the same, woman speaking \nof a sacred order that is his, her will mirroring his because, in projecting his \ndivine as his own, man has still projected his other as the flip-side of his \nconceptual self. He has yet to recognise himself in his own material existence \nand to recognise the material existence of his true other-the  female genre. \nThis double existence, this double divine, therefore requires another \nmaterialism and another divine. In making such a shift, Irigaray is following \nMarx\u2019s assertion, in the Theses on Feuerbach, that Feuerbach\u2019s conception of \nessence is an abstract indwelling of the man who has  isolated himself, but this \ntime he is isolated not from the social as such but from the other sex, from \nnature.  Despite the apparent materiality of his feelings and affections, the \nconsciousness  to which this gives rise is celebrated by Feuerbach for being on \nthe side of consciousness, for transcending nature. So human nature produces \na consciousness  for which nature is merely the other side of species-conscious- \nness; matter and form are thus always defined by man.  Hence, Feuerbach \ndescribes the celebration of communion as a celebration of man\u2019s transcen- \ndence of and differentiation from nature. While the consumption of bread and \nwine does signal man\u2019s dependency, the true glory lies in man\u2019s consciousness \nof his ability to superimpose form and value upon such matter and to be aware \nof matter as  such; a pure celebration  of self-consciousness,  rather than, as  Marx \nwould seek, a recognition of the means of transcendence found in the product \nof social labour. \nWe  might speculate on the meaning of the bread and wine for irigaray\u2019s \nphilosophy of sexual difference.  Wouldn\u2019t it be a celebration of nature and a \nrecognition of the  collective debt owed to  it?  Not  for the purposes of \ndifferentiating  consciousness fiom nature, nor for reducing nature to a means, \nbut for the purpose of a physical and spiritual replenishment for the two sexes \nby means of le corps sexu\u00e9 and sang rouge.  In any case, Irigaray seeks to \nlocate the source of the divine in the passional, material existence of the two Luce Irigaray and divine matter  137 \nsexes,8  whereby the insideloutside dialectic operates within the horizon of an \nelemental materialism with cosmological scope. In an interview, \u2018L\u2019autre de \nla nature\u2019, she says: \nQuand je parle de nature, je ne reprends pas le sens que ce tenne a \ng\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans la culture occidentale: nature humaine, nature de \nl\u2019\u00e2me, nature psychique (...)

Comme le \nf\u00e9minin?\u2019 \nWho  knows the implications of this futuristic return to the elements? \nElizabeth Gross has argued that it is a textual strategy, the elementary particles \nbeing emblems rather than substantial units or the basic data of reality. lo They \nhave a metaphorical rather than referential status, facilitating a terminology \nfor the passional and for a corporeal sexual difference denied in dominant \ndiscourse. The latter point is undoubtedly true, as Irigaray does make poetic \nuse of the language of the elements. But to construct any strict differentiation \nbetween reference and metaphor is to misconstrue Irigaray\u2019s use of language, \nand not only Irigaray\u2019s.\u201d  For while it would be patently absurd to claim for \nher discourse of the elements the status of a truth scientifically  understood the \nmythical is deemed to have as much potential purchase on reality as so-called \ncontemporary scientific discourses, confined as they are to a certain herme- \nneutic circle or cultural imaginary.  We  might construe this imaginary as \nNietszchean-inspired, with its emphasis on chance, accident, multiplicity, \n8  Irigaray\u2019s philosophy has always entailed a certain reclaiming pf materiality; in Ce Sere qui \nn\u2019en est pas un,  Paris,  1977, her project is described thus:  Pour chaque philosophe-\u00e0 \ncommencer par ceux qui ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 une \u00e9poque de l\u2019histoire de la philosophie-il  faut \nrep\u00e9rer comment s\u2019o@re la coupure d\u2019avec la contigu\u00eft\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle, le montage du syst\u00e8me, \nl\u2019\u00e9conomie s  culaire\u2019 p. 73). \n9  Sorci\u00e8res, $1980,.  lb25. \n10  Irigamyundt e Divine, Sydney, Local Consumption Occasional Paper, IX 1986. \ni i  irigaray is of course operating within the parameters of the post-Stnicturafist discourse on \nlanguage and she has various \u2018styles\u2019 but perhaps the most apt summary of her own use of \nlanguage is to be found in this comment she makes upon Christ:  \u2018M\u00eame ses paroles visent \n\u00e0 toucher plut\u00f4t qu\u2019 \u00e0 prouver ou convaincre\u2019 (Amante Marine, Paris, 1980,194). Not ihat \nshe is to be seen as a Messianic figure! 138  Alison Martin \nbreaks with the past and so on.  According to Irigaray, the modem scientific \nsubject is principally interested in disintegration and catastrophies and that \nwhich  surpasses human  capacities and  natural rhythms.I2  She cites as \nexamples relativity theory, big-bang theory, quantum mechanics, and the \ngeneral trend towards paring down matter to ever-smaller  particles that require \never more technical methods to convince  us oftheir existence. Not to mention, \nin the human sciences, Freud\u2019s death drive, the prevalence of everything anti- \nor post- or deconstructive in philosophy, the packaging of the individual into \nvarious identities in sociology and into semes in semiology. In short, they are \nall, to varying degrees, negative, foregrounding explosion, discharge and \nentropy. \nSo it is with the language ofthe  elements  that Irigaray attempts to reinstate \nand develop a passional materialism that is nevertheless concerned with and \nable to articulate a sense of rhythm, balance and eq~i1ibrium.l~  It is envisaged \non a scale that is simultaneously universal and human, fiom a source that is \nwithin and beyond the human, yet conceivably manageable by the human, or \nrather, by men and women.  In envisaging such a vital source Irigaray is able \nto view creation less as the product of destruction and more a circulation of \nenergy, a harnessing and rehamessing of energies for which the subject is a \nmediation and a bridge, not a bridge to the unknown and forgetful loss, but to \nthe creation of what she calls the sensible tran~cendenta1.l~ \nThe sensible transcendental is  both universal and particular since it \nemanates fiom a passional corporeal  energy that accords with particular sexual \neconomies or rhythms, either the female or the male.  Thus it is universal for \neach sex as the transfiguration of their flesh, but particular to that sex.  As a \ntransfiguration of flesh it facilitates a consciousness but one which is always \nmaterial.  Hence, the locus of differentiation is not between the social and \n. \ni2  See \u2018Le sujet de la science,  est4  sexu\u00e9?\u2019 in Parler n \u2019estjamais  neutre,  Paris, 1985,307-21. \ni3  Irigaray\u2019s more recent work reveals a strong interest in  Buddhism and in yoga, and in the \npossibilities they present for cultivating body and flesh spiritually; she sets out the benefits \nof practising yoga in a pamphlet, Une attention au  soufle dans la vie, la pens\u00e9e. I\u2019amoui: \npublished by irigaray, 1992.  Nevertheless, she remains critical of  the Buddhist hierarchical \nmodel of sexual difference and of what she sees  as  the lack of reciprocity in its model of love. \ni4  See L\u2019Ethique de la d#\u00e9rence  sexuelle, Paris, 1984, 124. Luce Irigaray and divine matter  139 \nnature, but between the male and female economies, two kinds of nature \nproviding the resources for both subjects respectively, as they in turn do for \none another. Infinity is accordingly bound for Irigaray, it both enables a sense \nof accomplishment (or realisation) and sets out a form, a limit, without which \naffectivity would be amorphous.  This is not a teleology, since the transcen- \ndental, or projected divine, is un  devenir;  indeed, for Irigaray becoming is \ndivinity. Thus it is historical, man is not the end of man, nor woman the end \nof woman. By paying heed to their corporeal materiality they will always be, \nbut in the process of becoming. \nSo, what does such an exaltation of divinity offer women?  Given that \nIrigaray is not speaking of some weekend cult, it is clear that for her this has \nto be a central issue if women are to come to be as women. They can will their \nown becoming,  and feel this as  the creation and perfection oftheir subjectivity; \nthey can have a goal and value for themselves, beyond that stipulated by the \nother sex, for whom their only value is as mothers or virgins, or better still, \nvirgin-mothers;  for whom they are attributed most value to the extent that they \nreproduce the masculine form, or have a son, the mother\u2019s access and path to \ninfinity,  as in Mary\u2019s  As~umption.~~  Having an infinite would enable women \nto know finitude on their own terms, to die their own death (rather than always \nbeing present at the others\u2019 deaths), and that means, to change. The divine is \nnot, therefore, some unifying homogenising force imposing its will upon all \nwomen across space and time. Indeed, it ostensibly facilitates the measure of \nindividuality,  and provides an objective  through which women can at last begin \nto communicate and relate without the distancing mediation of men  and \nwithout the terriQing proximity of immediacy in which they rub together as \nopen wounds. Most importantly, as  the divine is what exists for its own sake, \npassional divine love is a love of the self, a mirror to reflect women\u2019s own \nbeauty back to themselves  as  an identity value rather than to reflect their means \nstatus,  their suffering and chastity, and their masquerade. \n15  Irigaray gives a dazzling  reinterpretation of Christ and of certain New Testament episodes in \n\u2018le crucifi\u00e9\u2019, the final section of Amante marine. 140  Alison Martin \nHardly a call to love thy neighbour, then, the divine is the path or way to \nself-love which, since it is determined in relation to one\u2019s genre, calls for \nrespect for the collectivity in the same measure, although this is most emphati- \ncally not on the basis of a rather masochistic idealistic concern for the other \nprior to the self.  Rather than sacrificially renouncing their own will, women \nwould be forging a collective will to help them give direction to their own will. \nI would interpret such a conception of will as that which would enable us to \ntie down disparate wills to something other than individual morality; in fact \nby providing a minimalist collective framework for ethical relations based on \nrespect, women might be freed from the oppressive responsibilities of moral- \nity; the chasm filled, men could no longer fill it themselves with their will, \nbuttressing their own ethical system by placing the burden of morality upon \nwomen.  Men would be forced to take responsibility for their own ethics. \nShould the possibility of such a divine ever arise, and therein lies another \npaper, it may also be seen as a structural possibility of releasing women from \ntheir function as fetish-objects and the focus for erotic violence.  The limit \nrepresented by the female as a gender would be completely different or other \nto the one man has created for himself in his systems. It would not be a limit \nto transgress if he is to find thejouissance of excess, his return to the same, \nhis unity with the continuum of material being, or his fusion with mother earth. \nOr, in other terms, he would no longer have to break the limit of the hymen in \norder to realise its exchange value, to affirm the value of  his sacred by violently \ndebasing it. \nFor Irigaray, these conceptions all rest on a false premise of primordial \nunity  which, no matter how allegedly material, is a conceptual absolute, \nanother mythical origin.  Sexual difference she argues is always already in \nplay, if only man were able to recognise it.  Differentiation does not, then, \nnecessarily ensue from the split between same and other to be overcome, \nsomething man or his reason created in order to propel his dialectic; nor is it \na limit he establishes only to transgress. The limit is given to men and women \nin their material sexual difference, which she believes they should enhance \nand spiritualise for their respective becoming.  They are not same and other, \nbut other and other-this  she posits as their eternal mystery and the motor of "}
