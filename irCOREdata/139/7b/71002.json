We \nhave developed a new preparation method for a binding phase, incorporated in a \nhydrogel, for the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique. It allows co-\nanalysis of sulphide and the reactive forms of phosphorus, vanadium and arsenic in \nthe porewaters at the surface of the device. This gel, when dried and analysed using \nlaser ablation mass spectrometry, allows the acquisition of high-resolution, sub-\nmillimetre-scale, data. The binding phase was deployed within a DGT device in a \nsediment core collected from a productive lake, Esthwaite Water (UK). Localized \nremoval from the porewaters of the sediment for phosphate and vanadium has been \ndemonstrated at a microniche of local sulphide production. The possible removal \nprocesses, including bacterial uptake and reduction of vanadate to insoluble VIII by \nsulphide, are discussed. Understanding processes occurring at this scale may allow \nimproved prediction of pollutant fate and better prediction of past climates where \ntrace metals are used as paleoredox proxies.  \nKeywords: DGT, early diagenesis, laser ablation, microniche, phosphate.       \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n3 \nIntroduction \nRecent developments in analytical techniques have enabled two-dimensional analysis \nin sediments of oxygen, pH, pCO2, sulphide, Fe, Mn and trace metals.[1-7] Several of \nthese techniques have identified microniches, characterized by geochemical behaviour \nsignificantly different from the average for the given depth. These niches are \ngenerally attributed to elevated microbial activity at discrete sites with high \nconcentrations of labile organic matter.[8] If processes associated with microniches are \ndemonstrated to be significant in terms of the accumulation of specific elements in \nsediments, some reassessment of our current understanding of bulk sediment \ndiagenesis may be required. Processes at microniches may affect: our understanding \nof pollutant fate, the interpretation of trace metal data for the prediction of past \nclimates, or the prediction of reaction rates for redox processes. Sulphide, metal oxide \nand arsenic data can inform all of these subjects and phosphate may provide \ninformation relevant to the growth stage of the microniche bacteria.  \nVanadium is likely to be in the measurable form H2VO4- in the pH range 5-9 and the \nEH (redox potential) range 0-1 volts.[9] Reduction of VV to VIV can occur with organic \nmaterials as electron donors,[10, 11] with reduction to VIII requiring a stronger reductant. \nVIII is rapidly hydrolysed in aqueous solution, resulting in the precipitation of \nrelatively insoluble VIII oxyhydroxides.[9]  Sulphide can reduce VIV to VIII, but when \nstudied under laboratory conditions the reaction was slow at natural sulphide \nconcentrations.[9] However, the authors considered that effects such as surface \ncatalysis may increase reaction rates under natural conditions.  \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n4 \nRemoval of As from anoxic porewaters, observed by Huerta-Diaz et al,[12] was \nattributed to co-precipitation with FeS and\/or adsorption on FeS. Microniches may \nhave implications for As and anionic metal oxides such as vanadate, molybdate, or \nperrhenate, which are known to have a tendency to accumulate in strongly reducing \nsediments.[13-16] Diffusion of these oxyanions into sulphidic microniches within the \noxic, suboxic and weakly reducing zones may enable fixation where no net removal is \npredicted. Provided these reactions are not fully reversible, these discrete \nenvironments may account for a significant part of their bulk sediment accumulation. \nPhosphate release from organic matter (OM) degradation occurring in microniches \nmay be overcompensated by uptake from OM reducing microorganisms that are in the \nexponential growth phase. Tezuka s[17] observation of no phosphate regeneration at \nlow substrate nitrogen  (C:N of 60:1) was attributed to the capacity of bacteria to store \nexcess P within their cells.  \nIt has been recognised that a lack of congruent analysis makes it difficult to cross \ninterpret data obtained from different probes.[8] Data obtained simultaneously from the \nsame probe can be easier to interpret, as assumptions about the deployment conditions \nand nature of microniches do not have to be made. Here we describe a new method \nfor the preparation of a binding phase gel for diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) \nbased on iron oxide, which is suitable for the binding of soluble reactive species of \nphosphorus, vanadium and arsenic. This gel is combined with a previously described \nsulphide binding phase of silver iodide to provide visual identification of sulphidic \nmicroniches. Analysis of the combined gel using laser ablation inductively coupled \nplasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) gives two-dimensional data at high-\nresolution (sub-mm). We detail the principles of DGT, preparation of the combined \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n5 \nphase gel, deployment procedure, LA-ICP-MS procedure, and results obtained from \nanalysis of a sulphidic microniche.  \nPrinciples of DGT \nImmobilisation of analytes diffusing through a filter membrane and a diffusive gel \nfrom the porewater to the binding layer, results in a concentration gradient through the \ndiffusive layers. The concentration of solute accumulated in the binding gel (M) per \nunit area (A, cm2), divided by the deployment time (t, s), gives the time averaged \nsolute flux (F) through the diffusive layers (typical units mol cm-2 s-1, Eq. 1) \n\/F M At\n  \n(1) \nDGT utilises Fick s law of diffusion to determine the average concentration at the \nDGT interface (CDGT) from the mass of analyte on the binding layer (Eq. 2). \n\/d DGTF D C g (2) \nWhere g is the diffusive layer thickness and Dd is the diffusion coefficient in the gel. \nCombining Equations 1 and 2 allows calculation of CDGT (Eq. 3).[18] \nDGT\nd\nM gC\nD At\n(3) \nIn sediments, CDGT is the average concentration at the surface of the DGT device \nduring the deployment. It is only the same as undisturbed porewater concentrations \nwhen resupply from the solid phase is sufficient to prevent their depletion. In most \ncases resupply will be insufficient for full buffering and partial resupply will be \ncontrolled by the desorption kinetics (characteristic response time[19, 20]) and partition \ncoefficients of the analyte. Various cases of resupply are considered by Zhang et al.[21] \nWhere a solute is being locally generated within the sediment at rates higher than the \naverage for that depth, there will be local elevation in the porewater concentration. \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n6 \nThe elevated concentration and comparatively high rate of resupply will contribute to \na higher DGT signal.[22] DGT-observed elevations in concentration can therefore be \nindicative of localised release processes and conversely, observed minima in \nconcentrations may be indicative of other processes such as scavenging.  \nMaterials and methods \nPreparation of diffusive gel \n0.4 mm thick diffusive gels were prepared using established procedures,[23] from gel \nsolution prepared from the following reagents, 37.5% acrylamide solution (40% w\/w, \nBDH, Electran), 47.5% 18.2M \u00b7cm Milli-Q (MQ) water and 15% DGT cross-linker \n(2% w\/w, DGT Research Ltd.). Chemical polymerization was initiated by ammonium \npersulphate (10% w\/w; APS, BDH Electran) and catalysed by TEMED (99%, N, N, \nN, N-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine, BDH Electran).  \nPreparation of the combined silver iodide-iron oxide binding layer  \nPreparing the AgI phase \nA homogeneous gel, where AgI is precipitated into a pre-cast gel, first suggested by \nTeasdale et al[24] was reported by Devries and Wang.[4]  The method presented in this \nwork is a modification of the Devries and Wang procedure using the gel solution \ndescribed above.[25] 0.153 g of silver nitrate (BDH, AnalaR) was dissolved in 0.45 ml \nof MQ water. 8.55 ml of gel solution and 36 \u00b5l of 5% w\/w APS were added to the \ndissolved AgNO3 and well mixed between each addition (TEMED catalyst was not \nrequired). Following addition of the last solution, the gels are cast immediately \nbetween glass plates spaced by a 0.25 mm plastic spacer, resulting in a 0.4 mm thick \ngel after hydration. Once cast the gels are allowed to polymerise at room temperature \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n7 \n(20\u00b12 \u00b0C) in dark conditions for approximately 1 hour. Following polymerisation, the \nglass plates are opened so that the gel remains adhered to one plate. The plate and gel \nare then immersed in a solution of ~0.2 M potassium iodide (16.6 g in 500 ml, Acros \nOrganics, ACS reagent grade). The gel becomes white within a few minutes and is \npeeled off from the glass plate (this procedure ensures the precipitate in the gel is \ndistributed evenly). Gels are then kept in the KI solution overnight to allow full \ndevelopment, before being rinsed several times in MQ water to remove excess \nreagents.  \nAddition of the iron oxide phase \nAn iron oxide gel, prepared using ferrihydrite slurry as the binding agent, was first \nreported by Zhang et al[18] for the measurement of dissolved phosphorus. Inevitable \nheterogeneity in the particle size and distribution makes this gel unsuitable for high-\nresolution analysis. The method presented here provides a homogeneous gel by \nprecipitating ferrihydrite directly in the gel. Four grams of ferric nitrate \n(Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O; BDH, AnalaR) were dissolved into approximately 40 ml of MQ \nwater. Three AgI gel sheets were placed into the solution and the volume made up to \n100 ml. The gels were allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of two hours. Following \nequilibration the gels were rinsed for a few seconds in MQ water before being \nintroduced, one by one, into a 0.05 M solution of sodium bicarbonate (BDH, AnalaR) \nthat was previously adjusted to pH 6-7 by addition of ~1 ml of nitric acid (70%, BDH, \nAristaR). Gels give the appearance of total precipitation of orange-brown ferrihydrite \nwithin 5 min, but are left in the solution for  ~30 min to ensure complete \ndevelopment. Prepared gels were rinsed several times in MQ water to remove excess \nreagents.  \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n8 \nThe presence of carbonate in the ferrihydrite binding layer from the buffer solution \nmay lead to an increase in the rate of conversion of ferrihydrite to goethite.[26] As this \nmay change the binding properties of the gel, it is recommended that the ferrihydrite \nphase be freshly prepared before deployment. Should the sulphide scans not be \nrequired, the AgI gel can be replaced with a DGT diffusive gel to give a binding layer \ncontaining only ferrihydrite.   \nCalibration procedure \nDiscs of binding phase gel (4.9 cm2) were exposed to known molar amounts of \nsolutions of phosphate, vanadate and arsenate (thus giving known molar amounts \nbound per cm-2). Standards were prepared from the salts, sodium hydrogenarsenate \nheptahydrate (Sigma, 98%), sodium orthovanadate (Aldrich, 99.8%) and di-sodium \nhydrogen orthophosphate dodecahydrate (BDH, GPR). Discs were placed into vials \ncontaining 14 ml of each standard solution and shaken in an end-over-end stirrer for \n72 hours. No analytes were detectable in the solutions after this time, indicating \ncomplete uptake by the gels. Following exposure, gels were placed onto a \npolysulphonate filter and dried for laser analysis.   \nDeployment procedure \nDGT sediment probes (DGT Research Ltd.) were used to contain the gel layers. The \nbinding layer was placed onto a polysulphonate backing filter (0.45 \u00b5m pore size; Pall \nCorporation) to aid removal of this layer from the probe assembly after deployment. \nThe filter also supports the dimensional integrity of the binding phase during handling \nand drying. The binding layer is positioned in the probe housing, and then overlaid by \nthe diffusive gel and a filter, which prevents fouling of the diffusive gel. All layers are \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n9 \nheld within the plastic housing by means of a close fitting plastic window. The \nexposed area of the probe is 150 \u00d7 18 mm. Prior to deployment all probes were \ndeoxygenated for 24 hours by submerging in a 0.01 M sodium chloride solution \n(BDH, AnalaR) through which oxygen free nitrogen gas was continuously bubbled.     \nSediment probes were deployed in sediment from Esthwaite Water (UK), a small, \nproductive, softwater lake, which is seasonally anoxic and has a sediment whose \nporewater chemistry is dominated by iron and manganese.[27]  Intact cores of the \nsediment and overlying water were collected in May 2007 from the deepest basin \nusing a Jenkin corer. Oxygen was present in the overlying water and it was \nmaintained during the experiment by bubbling with air. Probes were deployed for a \nperiod of six days (T = 20\u00b12 \u00b0C). After deployment, the gels were cut from the probe \nwindow with a Teflon coated razor blade. The binding phase was placed between \nclean plastic sheets and refrigerated before being dried. The drying procedure is \nprovided as Accessory Materials.  \nLaser ablation procedure \nLaser ablation (LA) was undertaken using a New Wave UP-213 coupled to a Thermo \nElectron X Series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). A beam \ndiameter of 100 \u00b5m was selected to achieve the maximum analyte signal. Ablation \nintensity was set at 43% with a firing time of four seconds and an inter-sample dwell \ntime of 10 s. These parameters were chosen to ensure peaks were easily defined from \nthe background by the instrument software. The distance between ablation spots was \n333 \u00b5m. The procedure for extracting the transient peaks from the time series of \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n10 \ncounts followed the method described by Warnken et al[5] (the exact procedure is \nprovided as Accessory Materials).   \nObtaining qualitative sulphide data \nQualitative sulphide data from the deployed gels was obtained by computer imaging \ndensitometry (CID). Gels were scanned, after ablation, using a flatbed scanner \n(Hewlett Packard ScanJet 2100C). Files were saved as greyscale tagged image file \nformat (.tif) to enable conversion of the images to background corrected text files \nusing Scion Image, image-processing software (Scion Corp., freeware available from \nhttp:\/\/www.scioncorp.com, accessed March 2007). Data were then plotted as \ncolourmaps using Matlab. Scanning of the gels after laser ablation allows the ablation \ngrid to be mutually visualized with sulphide and avoids potential contamination of gel \nhandling before laser analysis. Future work should include the quantification of the \nsulphide data. CID is not a suitable technique for sulphide calibration as the \nferrihydrite contributes to a high background greyscale value. Optimisation of laser \nablation techniques to include S will be required.  \nResults and discussion \nAnalytical performance \nFigure 1 shows the time series of counts for the analytes and internal standard for the \ngel used for the 0.14 nmol cm-2 calibration for As and V (1.4 nmol cm-2 for P). Good \nanalytical precision was achieved for all analytes and the internal standard (residual \nstandard deviation (RSD) <10%). 57Fe was chosen as the internal standard for this \nwork as its mass is closer to those of the analytes than 13C (used previously for \ncationic metals in gels).[5] Furthermore, the peak count to background ratio for Fe was \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n11 \nsignificantly higher than for C. Internal standardisation was performed on a line-by-\nline basis, with each data point adjusted according to the average of the internal \nstandard for the line. All data were then standardized against the average peak areas of \nthe standard gels. Analytical precision tended to improve with internal \nstandardisation. The RSD decreased by 0 to 7.6% in eleven cases and increased by \n1% and 2.1% in 2 cases. As analysis of the blank did not produce resolvable analyte \npeaks, method detection limits (MDL) were determined using three times the standard \ndeviation of the lowest concentration standard. Time averaged detectable CDGT \nconcentrations for a deployment of six days were 9.8, 0.16, and 0.39 nM for P, V and \nAs respectively. This corresponds to a MDL per ablation spot of 39, 0.65 and 1.6 fmol \nfor P, V and As respectively. Calibrations were linear for all analytes (r2 > 0.995, n = \n4 for V and As, n = 8 for P).  \nIn situ profiles \nDeployed gels were analysed in a 1.2 \u00d7 0.25 cm area around a sulphidic microniche \nlocated approximately 11 cm below the sediment water interface. The ablation grid \nspacing was 333 \u00b5m, giving 280 data points for the gridded area (Figure 2). The 2D \nimages of concentration and 1D concentration-depth profiles (obtained by averaging \ndata at 1 mm vertical intervals) show elevated sulphide directly associated with \ndepleted P and V. Arsenic shows no clear depletion in the 2D image, but the \nconcentrations in the vertical profile are generally lower in the vicinity of the \nmicroniche.   \nSulphidic microniches previously observed by DGT techniques have been attributed \nto sulphate reducing bacteria at discrete sites of OM that can be utilised by these \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n12 \nbacteria.[4] Several studies[17, 28-30] have revealed that bacterial decomposition of OM \ncan reduce ambient P levels due to enhanced uptake during the bacterial growth \nphase. There is no net release of P until death of the bacteria. Our observed depletion \nof P at the sulphidic microniche (Figure 2) is consistent with active decomposition of \nOM. This is supported by a good inverse correlation between the mm-averaged \ngreyscale values (sulphide) and P (Table 1). Although a pH decrease at microniches \nof decomposing OM have been observed,[31] this should have little impact on the \nadsorption capacity of the binding phase, as lowering the pH will alter the ambient \nconditions further away from the point of zero charge of ferrihydrite. Zhang et al[18] \nfound no change in the P adsorption behaviour of ferrihydrite slurry gel over a pH \nrange of 2-10.  \nThe potential of V to accumulate or be retained by sediments under strongly reducing \nconditions has been recognised.[10, 15] V is also known to be incorporated into enzymes \nof nitrogen fixing bacteria.[32, 33] Bacterial cultures isolated from crude oil \ncontaminated land have been shown to bioaccumulate vanadium from agar medium at \nhigh V concentration.[34] Microorganisms capable of reducing vanadium have been \nisolated and the possibility of microbial reduction causing precipitation of V in anoxic \nenvironments has been recognised.[35] Several studies have suggested V \nconcentrations are reduced by phytoplankton uptake or biogenic adsorption in surface \nlayers of oceans[36,37] or lakes.[38] Observations of depletions of V in oxic waters of the \nMississippi River Delta were initially attributed to these processes.[39] However, a \nmore recent study suggests that mixing of surface waters with V depleted bottom \nwaters may explain depletions in overlying water.[40] Comparison of the mm-averaged \ndata (Figure 2) for V and P gives an indication that the data are closely correlated \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n13 \n(Table 1). Given this close correlation and evidence for both the microbial uptake of \nphosphate and vanadium s microbial role, it is more likely that the vanadium \nobservations at the microniche are due to microbial activity. However, without \nevidence for the utilisation of V by sulphate reducers, V profiles in Figure 2 could be \nattributed to sulphide reduction and subsequent scavenging or by a combination of \nthis processes and biological utilisation.  \nStrains of bacteria capable of reducing arsenate and sulphate concomitantly have been \nisolated. Arsenate can also be bacterially or inorganically reduced to arsenite, which \nhas similar retention properties on iron oxide as arsenate. Arsenite can subsequently \nreact with sulphide to produce thioarsenite. Thioarsenite can, in turn, co-precipitate \nwith iron sulphide or precipitate as arsenic sulphides (Nicholas et al, and references \ntherein[41]). Fox and Doner[15] concluded that As can be accumulated or retained in \nsediments under strongly reducing conditions, but in moderately reducing conditions \nmobilisation may occur. The mm-averaged data suggest that there may be some link \nbetween the elevated microbial activity (and thus sulphide) at the microniche and the \ndepleted As concentrations. However, due to the lack of a direct association between \nsulphide and As in the 2D data, there is no clear evidence for the processes described.   \nMuch is known about molybdenum geochemistry and it can provide an example of \nwhy microniche geochemistry may be important in the diagenesis of some elements. \nMolybdate (MoO42-) can be reduced by sulphide in a stepwise manner to form \nintermediate oxythiomolybdates (MoO3S2-, MoO2S22-, MoOS32-) on the reaction \npathway towards the formation of tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42-).[42]  It has also been \nproposed that this sulphidation does not follow first order kinetics and that a three fold \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n14 \nincrease in H2S concentration may result in a 100 fold change in reaction rates.[42]   \nFurthermore, the sulphidic forms have been shown to be more susceptible to \nscavenging.[43]  Recently, evidence for the analogous intermediates of \n(oxy)thioarsenates (AsOxS3-x3-, x = 0 3) has been presented.[44] Should the rate and \nscavenging behaviour be analogous to that observed for molybdenum, arsenic \ntransformations at sulphidic microniches may be significant, compared to the average \nfor that depth.  Helz et al[43] have raised the possibility that Mo fixation within highly \nsulphidic microenvironments (such as those observed by Widerlund and Davison[25] \nand Motelica-Heino et al[45]) may be misinterpreted as fixation at low sulphide \nconcentrations within the bulk sediment. This may also apply to As and anionic metal \noxides.  \nProcesses occurring in microniches may have wider implications in understanding \npollutant fate and the use of trace elements in providing paleoredox information. If the \ndepleted V concentration is caused by bacterial uptake, death of the bacteria may \nrelease the V, with no net accumulation over the duration of the bacterial lifecycle. \nHowever, if sulphide reduction and subsequent scavenging is the sole process \nresponsible for the depleted concentration, microniches, if significantly distributed, \nmay provide an additional sink for V. In using trace elements, including vanadium, as \npaleoredox proxies[46] in predictions of past deposition climates, it may be necessary \nto consider sediment microniche processes. Bioturbation, with associated \nmicroniches, will be expected in all but pristine (i.e. no or low OM input) or euxinic \nenvironments. Fixation at microniches could be misinterpreted as fixation within \nambient anoxic or suboxic sediment. This highlights the importance of using multiple \nindicators when predicting past deposition climates. \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n15  \nConclusions \nThis work reports the development and deployment of a combined phase AgI-\nferrihydrite DGT gel and demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in yielding \nnew geochemical information about sediment microniches. Phosphate uptake \nassociated with elevated activity of sulphate reducing bacteria has been demonstrated. \nUnequivocal interpretation of the vanadium and arsenic data is more difficult, as the \nliterature indicates that more than one mechanism may be possible. Further work is \nrequired to determine if bacterial uptake, use by bacteria as an electron acceptor, \nreduction by sulphide and subsequent scavenging, or other processes are responsible \nfor the observed depletions associated with sulphide production.   \nAcknowledgments  \nWe thank Kent Warnken for providing expertise with the laser ablation set-up and use \nof the time resolved analysis data processing application in PlasmaLab, and Debbie \nHurst for assistance with sample collection.

Analyte profiles at a microniche. 2-D images show greyscale density for \nsulphide and DGT resolved concentrations (CDGT) for P, V and As. The ablation grid \n(eight columns, 35 rows) can be seen on the sulphide scan with each point \nrepresenting a data point for the 2D CDGT figures. 1-D plots show concentration-depth \nprofiles obtained by averaging the data into one-mm deep vertical slices (24 ablation \nspots per point, except the lowest point where the bottom two rows of ablation spots \nare averaged). Averaged greyscales values are affected, due to the ablation spots \nhaving low values. The elevated sulphide at the very bottom of the analysed area is \npossibly associated with a general elevation in sulphide at that depth, as such a feature \nwas present across the entire width (18 mm) of the DGT probe for that depth \ncoordinate (this work, unpublished data). Distances are in cm and are relative to the \ntop right hand corner of the area. \n Access the published article at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN07096\n25 \nHigh-resolution two-dimensional quantitative analysis of phosphorus, vanadium \nand arsenic, and qualitative analysis of sulphide, in a freshwater sediment.  \nAccessory materials \nGel drying procedure \nGels were initially part dried by placing the gel (and backing filter membrane) onto a \nthick blotting paper, the gels were covered with a plastic film and put under light \npressure overnight.  This pre-drying step was necessary to avoid inhomogeneous areas \nforming on the gels.  Gels were then transferred to a gel drier (Bio-Rad model 543) at \n60\u00baC for eight hours (A. Widerlund, unpublished data).  When dry, areas of interest \non the gel were cut and mounted onto glass microscope slides with double sided \nadhesive tape.  \nLaser ablation TRA data processing procedure \nThe PlasmaLab software package (version 2.5.3.280) enables data processing using a \ntransient time resolved analysis (TRA) application.  The software identifies analyte \npeaks as counts per second (cps), performs background corrections and calculates \npeak areas as integrated counts per second. Peak finding was specified as absolute cps \nvalues with the baseline subtracted.  Minimum peak width was set at 11 time-slices \nand peak edge signal averaging was set at two data points. All other values were set at \nzero and no smoothing was specified.  Analyte peaks for one element can be copied to \nall remaining elements (and other samples if they contain the same number of \nablations), provided the position of the analyte peaks does not vary significantly with \ntime.  Values for peak areas can then be copied into alternative software (e.g. Excel or \nSigmaPlot) for data analysis (Warnken et al, 2004)[5]. \n"}
