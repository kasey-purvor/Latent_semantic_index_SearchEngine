Introduction 1 \nRiver-groundwater interactions are an important part of the hydrological cycle from 2 \nboth ecological and water resource perspectives. The supply of water to rivers, and the 3 \nprocesses by which this take place, have implications for nutrient and pollutant 4 \ntransport, ecological quality and the water supply for abstraction and recreational 5 \npurposes. Chemical tracers are a valuable tool to aid our understanding of these 6 \nprocesses. Here we examine the use of one such tracer, the natural radionuclide 222Rn, 7 \nto investigate river-groundwater interactions in the Chalk aquifer of southern England. 8 \n 9 \nRadon is a radioactive noble gas that is produced by radioactive decay of radium. 10 \nThere are three naturally occurring isotopes 219Rn, 220Rn and 222Rn, which are 11 \ndaughters of 223Ra, 224Ra and 226Ra respectively. In this paper we are concerned only 12 \nwith the 222Rn isotope; the 219Rn and 220Rn isotopes have half-lives of less than one 13 \nminute, and are therefore precluded from our analyses. From here on the term \u2018radon\u2019 14 \nrefers solely to 222Rn and \u2018radium\u2019 to 226Ra, which are members of the 238U decay 15 \nseries. Uranium occurs ubiquitously, albeit at a range of concentrations, in all rock 16 \ntypes. Radium is produced by the decay of 238U, but due to chemical and physical 17 \nprocesses it may be separated from its parent and hence be enriched in some mineral 18 \nphases, for example in surface coatings (Ball et al., 1991).  19 \n 20 \nRadon can emanate from radium bearing minerals and, subsequently be dissolved 21 \nin and transported by groundwater. The release of radon from mineral grains may 22 \noccur via a number of mechanisms, including ejection from the surface during the 23 \n 4\ndecay process (alpha recoil) or diffusion through pores and cracks. Radon produced 1 \nfrom the decay of surface bound radium may be more readily available to groundwater 2 \nin the saturated zone, and therefore the exact geochemical distribution of radium may 3 \naffect radon signatures in the groundwater. For a more detailed discussion of radon\u2019s 4 \nsources and modes of entry into groundwater the reader is referred to Osmond and 5 \nCowart (1992) and Porcelli and Swarzenski (2003).  6 \n 7 \nSurface waters usually contain very low concentrations of dissolved radium and, 8 \nhence, similarly low concentrations of dissolved radon (Osmond and Cowart, 1992; 9 \nPorcelli and Swarzenski, 2003). As a result, groundwater discharges into rivers can 10 \noften be easily detected by their characteristic radon enrichment with respect to the 11 \nsurface water. Once discharged to a river, the radon activity rapidly decreases as a 12 \nresult of radioactive decay and degassing to the atmosphere, allowing successive inputs 13 \nto be observed along the course of a river. As a consequence, radon has the potential to 14 \nbe used as a tracer of groundwater-surface water interactions. 15 \n 16 \nRadon has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other natural tracers; it is a 17 \nnoble gas and is therefore chemically and biologically inert. Consequently, budgeting 18 \nis relatively straight forward, as there are no sinks (other than radioactive decay and 19 \ndegassing) and no sources (other than radium decay). Nonetheless, degassing is an 20 \nimportant process; the partition between dissolved and gaseous radon is approximately 21 \n1:4 (Clever, 1979) and so the equilibrium is in favour of loss from the river to the 22 \natmosphere. It is therefore necessary to estimate the rate of loss from a surface water 23 \n 5\nbody due to degassing. 1 \n 2 \nRadon\u2019s short half life (t1\/2 = 3.82 days) means that it can be used to determine the 3 \nrecent history of groundwater. Radon will reach radioactive equilibrium with its parent 4 \n(radium) after 25 days. Therefore, the radon activity of groundwater will be indicative 5 \nof the environment within an approximate travel time of 25 days from the point of 6 \nsampling. This fact can be exploited to identify different sources of groundwater.  7 \n 8 \nRadon has been used as a tracer in a number of studies investigating groundwater 9 \ninputs to streams and rivers (e.g. Cook et al., 2003; Ellins et al., 1990; Genereux et al., 10 \n1993; Hamada, 1999), as well as to other hydrological situations such as the 11 \ndetermination of groundwater flow rates (Hamada, 2000) and the assessment of 12 \ninfiltration of river water to banks (Macheleidt et al., 2002). Thus its utility as a tracer 13 \nhas already been demonstrated in a range of hydrological situations, providing 14 \ninformation about flow paths and residence times. 15 \n 16 \nThe aims of this paper are to assess the potential for radon to be used as a 17 \nhydrological tracer for river-groundwater water interactions in lowland Chalk 18 \ncatchments. There is currently little or no data published regarding radon in the rivers 19 \nof Chalk catchments, which are of high ecological importance in the UK. Here we 20 \npresent data for groundwater and river water of the Pang and Lambourn catchments in 21 \nWest Berkshire, UK. We seek to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations in radon 22 \nin these two catchments and propose mechanisms to explain these variations. 23 \n 6\n 1 \nThis study has been carried out as part of the wider Lowland Catchment Research 2 \n(LOCAR) programme, supported by the UK Natural Environmental Research Council 3 \n(NERC). LOCAR was initiated to further our understanding of lowland permeable 4 \ncatchments through a multi-disciplinary research programme aided by the provision of 5 \ninfrastructure in selected catchments. 6 \n 7 \n2. Study area and background 8 \nThe Pang and Lambourn catchments are located in West Berkshire in southern 9 \nEngland, and are both tributaries of the River Thames. The Pang flows directly into the 10 \nThames, while the Lambourn flows into the Kennet which continues for a further 30 11 \nkm before it flows in to the Thames 12 km downstream of the Pang. The Pang and 12 \nLambourn have topographical catchment areas of 171 km2 and 234 km2 respectively 13 \n(Griffiths et al., 2006). 14 \n  15 \nThe River Pang flows initially to the south (Fig. 1) to the River Barn site before 16 \nturning east for 11 km; it then flows north for a final 3 km before reaching the Thames. 17 \nAlthough the source of the river channel is at Compton village, flow is only observed 18 \nfrom here in wetter years (Bradford, 2002), with the perennial head being found 19 \napproximately 3 km north of Frilsham Meadow. The Lambourn flows in a south-20 \neasterly direction from its source in the village of Lambourn for 23 km before its 21 \nconfluence with the Kennet. The perennial head is found approximately 3 km upstream 22 \nof East Shefford and migrates following fluctuations in the local groundwater table 23 \n 7\n(Grapes et al., 2006). All river and site distances referred to in this paper are measured 1 \nas distances downstream of the villages of Compton and Lambourn for the Pang and 2 \nLambourn, respectively. 3 \n 4 \nFlow in both catchments is predominantly derived from groundwater, which feeds 5 \nthe rivers either diffusely or from point sources. The extent of point and diffuse sources 6 \ndiffers between the two catchments. In the Lambourn accretion is relatively steady 7 \nthroughout the catchment (Grapes et al., 2005), although several zones of higher 8 \naccretion exist, which coincide with dry valley features (Griffiths et al., 2006). These 9 \nobservations indicate the diffuse nature of inputs to the Lambourn. In contrast, in the 10 \nPang catchment there are several spring inputs, particularly in the lower reaches, which 11 \ncontribute significantly to the base flow of the river (Griffiths et al., 2006). 12 \n 13 \nCretaceous Chalk (referred to hereafter as Chalk) dominates the solid geology of 14 \nboth the Pang and Lambourn catchments (Fig. 1). The Chalk is divided into three 15 \nmajor formations; the Upper, Middle and Lower Chalks. The Lambourn rises in the 16 \nMiddle Chalk and this formation makes up most of the upper catchment. The rest of 17 \nthe catchment is characterised by Upper Chalk with some small areas of overlying 18 \nQuaternary deposits from the Reading Beds and London Clay (Bradford, 2002). The 19 \nriver corridor has a bed of fluvial deposits, which increase in depth through the 20 \ncatchment (Grapes et al., 2005). In contrast the Middle and Upper Chalk form the 21 \nupper Pang catchment, and in the lower catchment there are far more extensive 22 \nQuaternary deposits overlying the Chalk. 23 \n 8\n 1 \nThe river water chemistry of both catchments is calcium bicarbonate type, typical 2 \nof groundwater fed Chalk rivers. Associated with Ca in the Chalk rock matrix are also 3 \nother members of the alkaline earth metals, namely Mg, Sr and Ba. Although, Sr and 4 \nBa are potentially useful indicators of groundwater inputs in Chalk catchments, Mg can 5 \nalso be associated with atmospheric and anthropogenic sources, such as sewage 6 \neffluent, which can blur groundwater signatures. The groundwater is usually calcium 7 \nsaturated, becoming super-saturated in rivers with loss of CO2 due to degassing and 8 \nbiological interactions (Neal et al., 2004). 9 \n 10 \nThe differences in physical characteristics between the Pang and Lambourn 11 \ncatchments give rise to differing flow characteristics and chemical responses. Both 12 \nrivers show seasonal minimum and maximum flows, which usually occur in 13 \nOctober-November and March-April respectively. Griffiths et al. (2006) observed that 14 \nthe Lambourn catchment has a greater total discharge than the Pang, even when 15 \nnormalised to catchment area (Lambourn = 0.0074 m3 s-1 km-2; Pang = 0.0035 m3 s-1 16 \nkm-2). Assuming equivalent rainfall, this analysis indicates that the Pang has a 17 \nproportionally smaller groundwater catchment than the Lambourn. 18 \n 19 \nNeal et al. (2004) noted that the Pang demonstrates a much greater and more rapid 20 \nresponse to rainfall events, which can be seen in its sharply spiked hydrograph. Fig. 2 21 \nshows discharge data during the study period for (a) the Lambourn at Shaw and (b) the 22 \nPang at Bucklebury, combined with effective precipitation based on values from the 23 \n 9\nUK Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evapotranspiration Calculation System 1 \n(MORECS) (Hough and Jones, 1997) estimates. The smoother response of the 2 \nLambourn can be seen in comparison to the relatively sharp spikes in the Pang 3 \nhydrograph, which coincide with precipitation events. This difference in behaviour 4 \ndemonstrates the effect of the relatively impermeable Quaternary deposits in the Pang, 5 \nwhich give rise to shorter residence times of rainwater through runoff and preferential 6 \nflow paths. The contrastingly small response to rainfall in the Lambourn may either be 7 \nthe result of a dampening effect by the permeable Chalk slowing transit times of 8 \nrainfall to the river, or as a result of a greater proportion of rainfall infiltrating and 9 \nrecharging the aquifer. 10 \n 11 \n3. Methods 12 \n3.1. Field sampling  13 \nSampling was conducted quarterly in the Pang and Lambourn catchments over the 14 \nperiod May 2003 to February 2005. On each occasion, discharge was measured at the 15 \nriver sites and water samples were collected for the analysis of dissolved radon. In 16 \naddition, groundwater was sampled from a number of riparian zone borehole arrays. 17 \n 18 \nRiver sites were located at convenient sampling locations and distributed along the 19 \ncourse of the rivers between one and three kilometres apart (Fig. 1). To ensure 20 \ncontemporaneous data all sites were located downstream of the perennial heads of the 21 \nrivers. Flow at river sites was measured using a handheld acoustic Doppler flow meter 22 \n(SonTek FlowTracker). Surveys were carried out following the guidance of the 23 \n 10\nrelevant British Standard (ISO748:2000, 2000) and Environment Agency R&D 1 \nTechnical Report W4 (Ramsbottom et al., 1997) to provide discharge data that is 2 \naccurate to \u00b1 10 %.  3 \n 4 \nFor the analysis of radon, individual water samples were taken directly from river 5 \nsites and the Blue Pool spring by immersing a pre-weighed standard 600 ml screw cap 6 \nglass bottle carefully avoiding any aeration, and then sealing the full bottle under the 7 \nwater surface to exclude all air.  8 \n 9 \nTo ensure that there was no stratification of radon in the river; samples were taken 10 \nby filling bottles from the surface as described above and also by pumping five litre 11 \nsamples, with a submersible pump, from the surface, mid-depth and the bottom of the 12 \nwater column. Triplicate samples were taken for radon analysis of river water during 13 \nthese tests to ensure consistency in river sampling and analysis. No stratification was 14 \nobserved in the river samples and replicate samples were in good agreement. 15 \n 16 \nGroundwater sampling sites were selected to be in the vicinity of the riparian zone 17 \nto allow sampling of water that was within the shortest possible travel time of the river. 18 \nIn the Lambourn samples were taken from three borehole array sites at Westbrook 19 \nFarm, Maidencourt Farm and East Shefford. Sampled piezometers ranged in depth 20 \nfrom 1.5 to 12 mbgl (metres below ground level). In the Pang samples were taken from 21 \ntwo sites at Frilsham Meadow and Frogmore Farm where piezometers ranged in depth 22 \nfrom 3.5 to 20 mbgl. 23 \n 11\n 1 \nGroundwater samples were taken from piezometers using a submersible pump 2 \nfitted with a suitable length of hose and located in middle of the screened section. First 3 \nthe piezometer was purged of three times the volume of the screened section to remove 4 \nany stagnant water. Then 5 litres water were carefully pumped in to a bucket from 5 \nwhich the standard 600 ml bottle was filled. Samples were taken in triplicate to ensure 6 \nthat the radon concentrations measured were representative and had stabilised after 7 \npurging, with a further three screen volumes being removed between each sample. The 8 \nradon stratification test carried out on river samples (outlined above) was also used to 9 \nconfirm that no radon losses were occurring as a result of the pumping process.  10 \n 11 \n3.2. Analytical methods 12 \nDissolved radon activities were determined by toluene extraction and liquid 13 \nscintillation spectrometry (LSS) as described in Pates and Mullinger (2007). Errors for 14 \nindividual river water samples are based upon counting statistics (Friedlander et al., 15 \n1981). Errors for borehole samples are standard deviations of triplicate sample results.  16 \n 17 \nIn order to confirm the absence of dissolved 226Ra in water samples a number of 18 \nriver and borehole samples were kept sealed for 30 days and then re-extracted. This 19 \nprocedure allows all excess radon present to decay and any remaining activity is due to 20 \nthe ingrowth of radon from radium present in the water. No detectable dissolved 21 \nradium was found in any of the river or borehole water samples. 22 \n 23 \n 12\nThe radon present at the time of sampling was calculated as a decay-corrected 1 \nmean. Radon in water is measured by its specific activity in Becquerels per litre (Bq 2 \nl-1). Specific activity is directly related to the concentration of a particular radionuclide 3 \nand for simplicity is referred to hereafter as concentration.  4 \n 5 \n3.3. Modelling approach 6 \nTo analyse the results of the river radon data, a simple mass balance model was 7 \nused, similar to those of Cook et al. (2003) and Genereux and Hemond (1990). When 8 \ncalculating a mass balance for radon, as opposed to a conservative tracer, two 9 \nadditional factors must be considered, i.e. the rate of loss of radon due to radioactive 10 \ndecay and the rate of loss from the river\u2019s surface to the atmosphere (degassing).  11 \n 12 \nThe mass balance of radon along the stream length is given by: 13 \ndwCkdwCIC\nx\nQC\nI \u03bb\u2212+=\u2202\n\u2202 , (1) \nwhere Q is the stream discharge (l s-1), C is the stream radon activity (Bq l-1), x is the 14 \ndistance downstream (m), I is the groundwater inflow rate (l s-1), CI  is the input water 15 \nradon concentration (Bq l-1), k is the gas transfer coefficient (s-1), w is the stream width 16 \n(m), d is the stream depth (m) and \u03bb is the radioactive decay constant (1.8245 \u00d7 10-6 17 \ns-1). 18 \n 19 \nThe change in flow with distance is given by: 20 \nEwI\nx\nQ \u2212=\u2202\n\u2202 , (2) \n 13\nwhere E is the evaporation rate (mm d-1). This equation assumes no additional 1 \nsurface water inputs such as tributaries, which is valid in the case of these permeable 2 \nlowland catchments and all inputs estimated from flow surveys are assumed to be of 3 \ngroundwater origin. Estimates of evaporation made from MORECS potential 4 \nevaporation data (UK Met Office) and the physical dimensions of the Pang and 5 \nLambourn rivers show that evaporation accounts for loss of less than 0.0005 % of flow 6 \naccretion over the considered reaches and can therefore be ignored. 7 \n 8 \nPrevious workers have used a variety of groundwater measurements to estimate a 9 \nsingle value for the radon concentration of input water (Cook et al., 2003; Ellins et al., 10 \n1990). This single value has then been used to calculate the rate of groundwater 11 \naccretion along selected river sections, with flow observations being used to verify the 12 \nmodelling results. Here we seek to examine how the input concentration of radon (CI) 13 \nvaries spatially and temporally within and between catchments. Therefore, we do not 14 \nassume a groundwater activity, but use flow observations to calculate CI. 15 \n 16 \nEquation 1 is solved to determine the input concentration (CI) that minimises the 17 \nleast squares misfit between model results and stream radon observations for a given 18 \nsurvey. If we assume a uniform input concentration along the reach then the 19 \noptimisation process seeks a single value of CI that is consistent with the observed 20 \nspatial variation in river radon concentrations. Alternatively, sub-reaches may be 21 \nassigned, each with different input concentration. Increasing the degrees of freedom in 22 \nthis way may lead to a marginally better fit between data and model, but results in 23 \n 14\nmore uncertainty in the final result due to non-uniqueness of the solution. We have 1 \ntherefore approached the problem by selecting the simplest model that is consistent 2 \nwith the data. 3 \n 4 \nIn the Lambourn catchment a model which allows a single value of CI was 5 \nconsidered most suitable. There are no distinct geological boundaries that are seen to 6 \ncause any major changes in the way the river system behaves as it runs through the 7 \ncatchment.  8 \n 9 \nIn the Pang catchment, there are significant Quaternary deposits overlying the 10 \nChalk in the lower catchment (Fig. 1). When modelling radon in the Pang, this 11 \ngeological distinction led to the river being divided into two reaches: an upstream 12 \nsection from Frilsham Meadow at 6.5 km to Jewell\u2019s Farm at 11.8 km and a 13 \ndownstream section from Jewell\u2019s Farm to Folly Bridge at 14.1 km (Fig. 1). This 14 \nboundary was chosen on the basis of observed flow and CO2 profiles in the Pang 15 \n(Griffiths et al., 2006; Griffiths et al., 2007), which indicate a distinct change in 16 \nbehaviour near Jewell\u2019s Farm, associated with the spring systems found downstream of 17 \nthis point (Bradford, 2002). This two reach model allows each to have an independent 18 \nvalue of CI. 19 \n 20 \nOne of the greatest difficulties in using radon, and other dissolved gases, for 21 \nbudgeting and tracer work in river systems is accounting for the impact of atmospheric 22 \ntransfer (in either direction). The rate of loss from the river surface or dissolution of 23 \n 15\natmospheric gases into stream water is dependant upon the gas transfer coefficient (k) 1 \nwith units of time-1. The final equilibrium water concentration depends on atmospheric 2 \nconcentrations of the gas in question. In the case of radon, atmospheric concentrations 3 \nare considered to be negligible due to its short half-life. There are several different 4 \napproaches that can be taken to estimate degassing from streams, and it is important to 5 \ncarefully consider the choice of method.  6 \n 7 \nMethods for estimating k include:  8 \n\u2022 The use of a range of empirical models are available that describe k as a function of 9 \nphysical characteristics of the river, many of which are described in Genereux and 10 \nHemond, 1992.  11 \n\u2022 Estimating degassing on a particular river or reach where it is assumed no 12 \ngroundwater interacts with the river system; the loss of radon from the reach is then 13 \nattributed only to degassing (e.g. Genereux and Hemond, 1992).  14 \n\u2022 Direct measurement using an artificially introduced gaseous tracer such as propane 15 \nor SF6 (e.g. Wanninkhof et al., 1990), used in conjunction with a conservative 16 \ntracer, such as salt, to account for dilutions effects., however, This type experiment 17 \nis complex and costly to set up. 18 \n\u2022 Deriving a degassing coefficient from modelling exercises by fitting to observed 19 \ndata (e.g. Cook et al., 2003).  20 \n 21 \nHere we have chosen a combination of approaches, evaluating several empirical 22 \nmodels against a set of observations made upon a one kilometre reach of the River 23 \n 16\nPang at Frilsham Meadow (Fig. 1). This reach differs from the majority of other 1 \nreaches in the Pang and Lambourn as it is relatively hydrologically isolated from the 2 \naquifer system. Flow observations made over the sampling period indicate that there is 3 \noften negligible accretion or loss along its length. During one such period of negligible 4 \naccretion (10 February 2005) river water samples were collected at 8 sites along the 5 \nreach and analysed for radon. The results show a steady decrease in radon 6 \nconcentration with distance and, therefore, these data were used to evaluate the 7 \nempirical models reviewed by Genereux and Hemond (1992) for use in the Pang and 8 \nLambourn rivers. From this exercise two gas transfer models (Negulescu and Rojanski, 9 \n1969; O'Connor and Dobbins, 1958) were selected as they bracket the stream radon 10 \nobservations. The equations for the gas transfer coefficients of these models are: 11 \n)\/81.12(7.0 5.15.0 duk = , (3) \nand  \n))\/(92.10(7.0 85.0duk = , (4) \nfor the O\u2019Connor and Dobbins and Negulescu and Rojanski models, respectively, 12 \nwhere k is the gas transfer coefficient (d-1), u is the mean stream velocity and d is the 13 \nmean stream depth. Note that in equations (3) and (4) the multiplier 0.7 is introduced to 14 \naccount for physico-chemical differences between oxygen (for which the models were 15 \nderived) and radon (Genereux and Hemond, 1992). 16 \n 17 \nThese two empirical models allowed a reasonable degree of uncertainty in the gas 18 \ntransfer coefficient to be estimated (Fig. 3). Given the two extreme models for 19 \ndegassing, equation (1) was solved using a finite difference approximation (see, for 20 \n 17\nexample, Cook et al., 2003).  A spatial discretisation of 25 m was adopted for this 1 \nsolution. Stream depth, width and mean velocity measured at each site along the reach 2 \nwere interpolated (assuming linear variation) to assign properties in equations (1), (3) 3 \nand (4) at each node of the finite difference grid. Then, the radon concentration of the 4 \nlateral input (CI) was determined by optimising the model given the observed stream 5 \nradon concentration for a particular survey.  6 \n 7 \nThe loss and gain of water from the river is interpreted as a net linear function 8 \nconstrained by flow observations at each gauging site. CI is only influenced by net 9 \nwater inputs to the river where it must be altered to provide the best fit to balance 10 \nobserved stream radon concentrations between sites. When water is lost from the river 11 \nthis does not affect the river radon concentration and, therefore, there is no impact 12 \nupon the value of CI. 13 \n 14 \n4. Results and discussion 15 \n4.1 Groundwater radon 16 \nThe results of groundwater radon observations in the Lambourn catchment (Fig. 17 \n4a) show a distinct vertical profile across all sites. Higher and more variable radon 18 \nconcentrations occur in the near surface and a general decrease in concentration is 19 \nobserved with increasing depth. From the borehole geological logs it can be seen that 20 \ngroundwater radon concentrations reflect the degree of weathering as it changes with 21 \ndepth. Near the surface, from 0-7 mbgl, there is much more weathered material 22 \noverlying and mixed with weathered Chalk. This overlying material comprises a 23 \n 18\nmixture of clay, sand and flint gravels and is typically heterogeneous in composition. It 1 \nnot only has a greater surface area for the release of radon, but is likely to contain 2 \nhigher radium concentrations than the Chalk, which is predominantly composed of 3 \ncalcium carbonate, thus leading to the higher activities of 3-12 Bq l-1 that are observed 4 \nin the near surface. From 7-10 mbgl is predominantly weathered Chalk where 5 \ngroundwater radon concentrations tend to be below 3 Bq l-1. As the more consolidated 6 \nChalk is reached, between 10 and 15 mbgl, the groundwater activity is found to be 7 \nlower and more consistent, reaching a highly stable value of 1 Bq l-1 in the deepest 8 \nsamples. 9 \n 10 \nGroundwater in the sampled Pang boreholes (Fig. 4b) follows a similar vertical 11 \nprofile to that of the Lambourn boreholes. Radon concentrations tend to be slightly 12 \nhigher at greater depths than at the Lambourn borehole sites, but still reach a very 13 \nstable 1 Bq l-1 at approximately 14 mbgl. Stable radon concentrations of 1 Bq l-1 are 14 \nseen across both catchments in piezometers screened at 15 mbgl and deeper. Some 15 \nvalues are observed between 5 and 10 metres that are slightly higher than in seen in the 16 \nLambourn, which is related to the increased weathering of the Chalk and depth of 17 \nalluvial materials at the Frilsham Meadow borehole site. 18 \n 19 \n4.2. Lambourn 20 \nA relationship is observed between the radon concentration and discharge profiles 21 \nin the Lambourn catchment (Fig. 5). The higher stream radon concentrations of 0.8 Bq 22 \nl-1 are due to the initial inputs of radon rich groundwater to the river channel, which 23 \n 19\nmake up a large proportion of the total flow at this point. The continued high radon 1 \ncoincides with the region of higher accretion between East Shefford (8.8 km) and 2 \nWelford (11.5 km). Between Welford and Westbrook Farm at (13.8 km) accretion is 3 \nreduced and radon also decreases, to 0.2 Bq l-1. As accretion increases again further 4 \ndownstream the radon concentration stabilises at 0.2 Bq l-1, with groundwater inputs 5 \nbalancing losses due to degassing.  6 \n 7 \nThe ranges of stream parameters for the degassing models in the Lambourn were d 8 \n0.13-0.53 m and u 0.09-0.51 m s-1. These values resulted in degassing constants of 9 \n2.95-33.79 d-1 for the O\u2019Connor and Dobbins model and 2.20-16.49 d-1 for the 10 \nNegulescu and Rojanski model.  11 \n 12 \nThe results of the Lambourn model (Fig. 5b) display a broad agreement with the 13 \nriver radon concentrations. The higher radon concentrations are maintained in the high 14 \naccretion zone then decrease further downstream, where accretion is low and losses 15 \ndue to decay and degassing dominate. The lower reaches are in equilibrium with radon 16 \ninputs being equal to losses. Here the two degassing models are in close agreement 17 \nwith each other and also with the circled data point, which has been included in the 18 \nradon plot, but was not used to constrain the model due to the absence of flow data. 19 \n 20 \nThe results of the two degassing models (Fig. 6a) display good agreement on all 21 \nsampling occasions, typically to within 0.5 Bq l-1, except in December 2004 where they 22 \ndiffer by 1 Bq l-1. A significant variation in the radon concentration of incoming 23 \n 20\ngroundwater is observed over the sampling period, given that the degassing models 1 \nused provide a ranged estimate of radon loss. Although the sampling resolution for 2 \nradon is lower than that of the flow data, there is a noticeable similarity between 3 \nchanges in calculated input concentrations and flow accretion for the studied section of 4 \nthe river (Fig. 6b). When accretion is lower, radon input concentrations tend to be low 5 \nand as accretion peaks radon inputs are also at their highest. It follows that these 6 \nchanges in river radon concentrations are due to changes in the net groundwater input 7 \nradon concentrations to the Lambourn. 8 \n 9 \nRelating the observed groundwater radon profiles to the changes in calculated 10 \ngroundwater input radon concentrations seen in the River Lambourn suggests that at 11 \ntimes of higher flow accretion more inflow to the river travels through the near surface 12 \nalluvial gravel deposits. Inputs during higher accretion periods are higher in radon, 13 \nwhich indicates either a greater proportion of flow passing through the near surface 14 \nalluvium or a greater residence time in this part of the aquifer. During lower flows the 15 \ninput concentrations return to the levels observed in the deeper piezometer water 16 \nsamples (1 Bq l-1) and may indicate a more direct connection between the river and the 17 \nconsolidated Chalk during lower flows. Thus, radon may provide a useful tool in 18 \nelucidating the flow paths of groundwater-surface water interactions in Chalk 19 \ncatchments, which can be problematic to evaluate due to anthropogenic impacts upon 20 \nor the uniformity of other chemical tracers, particularly in the Lambourn. 21 \n 22 \n4.3. Pang 23 \n 21\nTaking firstly the river observations for the Pang (Fig. 7) it can be seen that the 1 \nriver behaves differently in the upstream reach between Frilsham Meadow (6.5 km) 2 \nand Jewell\u2019s Farm (11.8 km) compared to the downstream reach between Jewell\u2019s 3 \nFarm and Folly Bridge (14.1 km). There is little accretion along the upstream reach, 4 \nwith a series of marginally losing and gaining sections, which contrasts with the 5 \ndownstream reach where there is consistent input of 0.2-0.4 m3 s-1 (Fig. 8a) due to 6 \nspring sources. The upstream reach exhibits seasonality in the flow, with accretion 7 \noccurring during higher flow periods and net flow loss during lower flow periods. 8 \nAccretion occurs for only a short period in the second half of the study period due to 9 \npoor winter recharge. The lower reach in contrast has a steady accretion, which is not 10 \nseen to vary seasonally. Both reaches show two rainfall response peaks in January and 11 \nMay 2004.  12 \n 13 \nThe variations in flow through the catchment are reflected in the radon profile (Fig. 14 \n7b). Relatively high river radon concentrations of 1.7 Bq l-1 are observed at the point of 15 \ninitial groundwater input to the river channel. This concentration falls sharply by 8 km 16 \nas the river loses flow and degassing and decay processes dominate. The radon 17 \nconcentrations remain at 0.1-0.2 Bq l-1 as the river marginally gains and loses water 18 \nuntil Jewell\u2019s Farm. There is then an increase in radon concentration below 11.8 km 19 \nassociated with the spring inputs occurring in this area.  20 \n 21 \nThe ranges of stream parameters for the degassing models in the Pang were d 0.08-22 \n0.52 m and u 0.04-0.48 m s-1. These resulted in degassing coefficients of 0.76-59.94 23 \n 22\nday-1, for the O\u2019Connor and Dobbins model, and 0.87-24.78 day-1, for the Negulescu 1 \nand Rojanski model.  2 \n 3 \nThe Pang model results closely match the river radon concentrations (Fig. 7b) at all 4 \npoints for both degassing models. There is a rapid decay in the first 2 km where 5 \ndegassing and decay dominate. There are then low but stable radon concentrations 6 \nfrom 9 to 11.8 km, after which there is a sharp increase as groundwater with an 7 \nenhanced radon concentration enters the river. The model of Negulescu and Rojanski 8 \n(1969) slightly underestimates degassing in the first two kilometres, but then aligns 9 \nclosely with that of O\u2019Connor and Dobbins (1958). The upstream reach input 10 \nconcentrations are generally low and poorly constrained by the two degassing models 11 \n(Fig. 8b). In the upstream reach there is generally closer agreement between the 12 \ndegassing models at times of higher flow when the upstream reach has a net accretion. 13 \nIn the lower catchment input concentrations are higher and the degassing models are in 14 \ncloser agreement (Fig. 8c). Radon inputs in the downstream reach are higher than those 15 \nof the upstream reach demonstrating that radon input concentrations vary spatially in 16 \nthe Pang.  17 \n 18 \nThe calculated inputs for the downstream reach reflect observations made at the 19 \nBlue Pool spring (Fig. 8c). The downstream modelled radon input concentrations 20 \nclosely correlate with the changes in spring concentrations, but are slightly lower. 21 \nThus, it can be concluded that the majority of water entering the river in this area is of 22 \nspring origin and analogous to that of the Blue Pool in radon concentration. The reason 23 \n 23\nthat calculated input concentrations are slightly lower than the observed spring water is 1 \nlikely to be due to degassing that occurs before the water enters the main river (the 2 \nBlue Pool feeds a cress bed pool complex so that discharge is not directly to the river). 3 \nFig. 8d indicates that a number of sampling occasions coincide with significant rainfall 4 \nevents, which produce large spikes in the Pang hydrograph. The events do not appear 5 \nto influence the spring radon concentrations in a consistent manner with high and low 6 \nradon corresponding with peak and base flow conditions. It is also notable that the 7 \ntemporal variation in radon occurs despite apparently constant accretion in the 8 \ndownstream reach. 9 \n 10 \nThe temporal variation in spring radon concentration and the corresponding 11 \nchanges in river radon will be due to the flow path of water issuing from these springs. 12 \nThe interactions of theoretically high radon pore water (Low, 1996a) along with lower 13 \nactivity water similar to that observed in the boreholes, and at times newer catchment 14 \nwater from rainfall runoff, create a mixture from which the components are difficult to 15 \nseparate and is beyond the scope of this work. However, it is clear that there are 16 \nsignificant temporal changes in spring water radon concentrations and that they may be 17 \ninfluenced in the short term by rainfall events, but in an inconsistent manner, based on 18 \nour current understanding. 19 \n 20 \n4.4. Comparing the Pang and Lambourn catchments 21 \nGroundwater radon is comparable between the two catchments with the Pang 22 \nshowing slightly higher concentrations at depth (Fig. 4). This corresponds to the 23 \n 24\nincreased depth of weathering at the Pang sampling sites. 1 \n 2 \nThe results from the two catchments show that despite their close proximity the 3 \nradon signatures are very different and are impacted by variations in geology. In the 4 \nLambourn a relatively homogeneous system is observed, with lower river radon 5 \nthrough the catchment. It may be that the alluvial gravels in the Lambourn valley are 6 \ninfluencing this homogeneity, spring systems that exist in the Lambourn will not be as 7 \ndirectly connected to the river and the radon signal from them will be attenuated by 8 \ninteraction with the alluvial gravels. 9 \n 10 \nIn contrast the Pang is more complex and can be divided into two discrete reaches 11 \nthat have different hydrological controls under the range of conditions observed. Each 12 \nof these reaches must be treated differently to accurately model the radon behaviour of 13 \nthe whole catchment. The upper Pang has little or no accretion under low flows and 14 \ngradual accretion during higher flow periods, with generally lower radon input 15 \nconcentrations similar to those observed in the Lambourn. The upper part of the Pang 16 \nis still influenced mainly by the Chalk in a similar manner to the Lambourn, whereas 17 \nthe lower Pang has more point source inputs from springs. These spring inputs 18 \ncontribute a consistently high volume to the total catchment discharge and have higher 19 \nradon concentrations. This spring influence is most apparent in the Jewell\u2019s Farm to 20 \nBlue Pool section where the course of the river brings it into very close proximity with 21 \nthe Quaternary deposits. These deposits bound the river to the south and it is at this 22 \nboundary that the springs occur as water escapes from beneath the confining layers. 23 \n 25\n 1 \nIn the Lambourn it was found that the radon inputs varied over the sampling period 2 \nand this temporal variability precludes deriving a single input radon concentration for 3 \nthe catchment from previous observations. The Pang is controlled in very different 4 \nways in the two reaches and this is readily observed in the radon signal in the main 5 \nriver and the calculated values of CI. The influence of Quaternary deposits in the lower 6 \nPang is not only reflected in its differences from the Lambourn hydrograph, but also in 7 \nthe radon signature in the river. The radon concentrations in the spring discharge are 8 \nmore analogous to those of shallow groundwaters than of the deeper Chalk.  9 \n 10 \nThe systems controlling flow generation and radon in the Pang catchment are 11 \ncomplex. Influences of diffuse groundwater transfers between the aquifer and river 12 \ncombine with the point source inputs from springs, which are subject to very different 13 \ncontrols. Diffuse inputs will be more closely related to changes in the local water table 14 \nas seen in the Lambourn (Grapes et al., 2006). Point source inputs may be controlled 15 \nby changes in the aquifer, but are also seen to have a rapid response to catchment 16 \ninputs and the springs reflect a combination of these.  17 \n 18 \nThere is no clear seasonal variation in the input radon concentrations observed in 19 \nthe Pang data. When calculated input concentrations are compared to the river 20 \nhydrograph over the sampling period (Fig. 8d) it can be seen that a number of the 21 \nsampling occasions coincide with large spikes in the river discharge. The data 22 \nresolution is not adequate to be able to evaluate exactly how river radon responds to 23 \n 26\nhydrological events. It may be that the rainfall response of the Pang in this data set is 1 \nmasking any seasonality that exists, where as the dampened rainfall response of the 2 \nLambourn allows these to be observed at lower temporal resolution. Here the recharge 3 \ncapacity of the Chalk helps to prevent rapid inputs of water to the river during and 4 \nimmediately after rainfall events. This buffering means that river sampling in the 5 \nLambourn is less impacted by rainfall events than in the Pang 6 \n 7 \n5. Implications for previous radon studies and future research 8 \nWe have shown that the different flow conditions and inputs must be considered 9 \nwhen deciding how to constrain catchment models. The more diffuse nature of the 10 \nLambourn compared to the point source discharges to the Pang create different flow 11 \nregimes and must be modelled accordingly. The differences between and within the 12 \nstudy catchments illustrates that spatial variation occurs in radon inputs as well as 13 \naccretion. Most previous studies, with the exception of Genereux et al. (1993) who 14 \ndiscriminate between vadose and saturated zone water, have made use of single values 15 \nfor radon input concentrations. While it may be possible to generalise at the scale of 16 \ncatchments described by Ellins et al. (1990) and Cook et al. (2003), this is not always 17 \nthe best approach, as seen in the River Pang. 18 \n 19 \nWe have seen significant spatial variation in near surface groundwater radon 20 \nconcentrations while deeper Chalk groundwater is highly consistent. Ellins et al. 21 \n(1990) observed large variation in radon concentrations in a karst aquifer, while Low 22 \n(1996b) and Younger and Elliot (1995) observe higher and more variable radon 23 \n 27\nconcentrations for deeper groundwater samples from the Chalk in other areas.  1 \n 2 \nTemporal variability in radon input concentrations is observed to both catchments, 3 \nwhich is important given that we wish to understand the controls on flow generation in 4 \nthe Pang and Lambourn and how they change in space and time. Part of the key to 5 \nunderstanding how radon reflects these changes, particularly in the Lambourn, lies in 6 \nour observations of the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer. Here high, variable 7 \ngroundwater radon concentrations exist and are therefore a potential source of variation 8 \nin river radon concentrations. The apparent relationship between accretion and river 9 \nradon concentrations in the Lambourn supports this hypothesis. 10 \n 11 \nThe variation in CI during the study period would have a significant impact upon 12 \nestimates of discharge made from radon observations. Simulating groundwater inputs 13 \nto the Lambourn by varying CI  within the range calculated by the model in this study  14 \nfound that significant over- and underestimation of groundwater inputs was made. 15 \nFrom a calculated groundwater CI of 1.5 Bq l-1 in the Lambourn, underestimation of CI 16 \nto 0.8 Bq l-1 would produce a 100 percent overestimation of flow. Underestimation of 17 \ngroundwater radon concentration is a possible error to make based on our observations 18 \nof the deeper Chalk groundwater, where concentrations are consistently low (~1 Bq 19 \nl-1). Care must therefore be taken when making assumptions about the stability of 20 \nradon concentrations in groundwater entering river systems of this type. 21 \n 22 \nSpring inputs to these rivers differ significantly in radon from the more diffuse 23 \n 28\nseepage inputs. Springs, which are more directly connected to the rivers (e.g. in the 1 \nPang), show strong radon signals in the stream water, whereas diffuse inputs, such as 2 \nseen in the Lambourn, provide a more uniform radon profile. In the Lambourn this 3 \nuniformity may be due to general seepage from the Chalk through the alluvium or to 4 \nattenuation of springs that do exist, but whose water has a significant flow path through 5 \nthe alluvial aquifer before discharging to the river. Temporal variation of major spring 6 \ninputs has a significant impact on river radon concentrations in the Pang. The 7 \nresponses of these springs to events is complex due to multiple flow paths and sources, 8 \ni.e. fracture flow, runoff and the dual porosity of the Chalk feeding them. 9 \n 10 \nRadon therefore has useful applications in observing input processes from the 11 \nChalk and alluvial aquifers of these catchments. It may be possible to determine the 12 \nduration of short (up to 25 days) residence times of water in the alluvial gravels (c.f. 13 \nMacheleidt et al., 2002). With additional chemical data radon may also be applied to 14 \ndetermining the degree of mixing of alluvial aquifer water with Chalk aquifer 15 \ngroundwater (c.f. Genereux et al., 1993). 16 \n 17 \n6. Conclusions 18 \nTemporal and spatial variations in radon inputs to rivers are observed in the Pang 19 \nand Lambourn catchment. These variations reflect seasonal changes in flow accretion 20 \nin the Lambourn and changes in spring radon concentrations in the Pang. Spatial 21 \nvariation in radon in these catchments reflects the geological controls on flow 22 \ngeneration and the different types of inputs that occur (diffuse and spring). These 23 \n 29\nresults show that caution must be used when applying radon to flow estimation, but 1 \nthat useful information about flow paths and flow generation can be gained from river 2 \nradon observations. There is still much to understand about temporal changes in river 3 \nand groundwater radon, particularly in the complex spring systems of the Pang, but we 4 \nhave shown that the alluvial aquifer of the Lambourn may have an important role in 5 \ninfluencing stream radon concentrations and flow generation. 6 \n 7 \nAcknowledgements 8 \nThis work was funded by a UK NERC grant under the LOCAR programme (Ref: 9 \nNER\/T\/S\/2001\/00948) and a NERC CASE studentship in association with the Centre 10 \nfor Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Wallingford (Ref: NER\/S\/A\/2004\/12162).
