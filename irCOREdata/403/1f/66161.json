The research presented here shows that British Asians connect with \na myriad of landscapes abroad including East Africa, India and Pakistan. These \nconnections to past landscapes are mapped and considered here as valued \nenvironments of British Asian women in Britain. Through the mapping of their \nbiographies, it is apparent that memories of other landscapes are embedded in \nenvironmental practices in Britain, therefore contribute to making the landscape in \nBritain inclusive and meaningful in the context of the South Asian migration. The \nmaps of migration show the heterogeneity of landscapes experienced by the British \nAsian women. Memories of other lands manifest themselves in the U.K. The second \nsection of the paper illustrates the effect of these memories on the South Asian home \nitself in the process of shaping diasporic geographies of belonging and being within \nthe U.K. \n \nKEY WORDS: South Asians, landscape, mapping, post-colonial, memory, race. \n \nMapping out South Asian migration \n \nThe presence of South Asians in Britain results from Britain\u201fs early colonial \nexpansion and rule and the subsequent post-colonial migration of peoples across the \ncolonies and to the heart of colony \u2013 Britain. Within colonial narrative, the Asians are \nothers within the Empire and British national identity (Said 1978). However, when \nliving within the heart of the metropolis (London) their presence is evidence of the \nmulti-locatedness of Britishness, and its complex identities. Using a post-colonial \nlens, Britishness is not only a culture of governance in India and other colonies, but \nalso represents the national culture of British citizenship. Britishness is a mobile \nnationalism rendering the experience of migrant British subjects beyond the \nconventional paradigmatic structures of national identity. The South Asian population \nattains a fluid citizenry from their geographical mobility through other national \nlandscapes governed by Britain, during Imperial rule. British Asians have migrated, as \n 2 \ncolonial labour and post-colonial British subjects, across several continents including \nAsia, Africa, Europe and North America, particularly during the 19\nth\n and 20\nth\n \ncenturies. Through their migration and settlement in new territories, South Asians \nthey have been simultaneously bounded into structures of various colonial nations, \nterritories and environments. As mobile subjects within these territories they are and \nhave been marginalized from inclusion in these various national cultures resulting in \ntheir many hybrid connections with the citizenship of many nations. The community \npossesses an evolving consciousness of being a \u201cpost-national\u201d of a colony, feeling an \nunfixed territorial nationalism beyond legal citizenships, and the national borders of \nIndia, East Afica and England. This creates diasporic subjectivity as spatially and \ntemporally in dynamic flux. This dynamism contrasts with the classic \u201efixing\u201f of \nracial identity to a singular territory within racial theory, dominant in the colonial \nperiod, through which post-colonial diasporic communities living in the West, have \nbeen figured in historical, political and cultural discourse. \n \nTo understand the cultural impact of migration and settlement in Britain it is \nimportant to explore the effect of this geographical mobility on British national \nidentity and cultures of landscape. By examining British Asian contacts with \nlandscapes and environments in the migratory journey we can consider the value of \nother landscapes to their sense of Britishness. Mapping out South Asian migration \nroutes and thus their multiple citizenships is the aim of this first section. The women\u201fs \nbiographies ground the research in their lived experience and geographical \nconnections with nations and landscapes. The second section considers the effect of \nthis geographical mobility on securing aesthetic and material connecting points to \nother natures and landscape in the home in Britain. These include organic practices in \n 3 \nthe home and environmental values expressed in domestic cultures. These are \nrecognised here as aesthetic and textural links to past environments and landscapes. \nThe maps produced here, reaffirm the necessity for cultural theorists to continue to \nmove beyond essentialist understandings of race, that have emerged through a \ncolonial past (Fanon 1959; Fanon 1961; Fanon 1967). Like other diasporas, British \nAsians do not figure as an essential race-group, they instead constitute as a political or \ncultural network, in different moments and in various configurations. Many writers \nhave examined these networks, formed through global media and communication, and \nthe possibility of global ethnoscapes (eg. Appadurai, 1996). Here, ethnicity is \nconsidered in its local context; grounded in the landscape of the homes of post-\ncolonial migrant women. \n \nIn this research, the maps are formed through oral testimonies that have been \nrecorded, of the experience of migration experienced by South Asian women. \nEmbedded within these narrations are environmental connections and attachments to \nnation and region, and the stories situated in lived landscapes. For the women in the \nstudy, marginalised from the national landscape of Britain (Agyeman 1990; Malik \n1992), other landscapes, and ecologies become sites of affirming individual and \ncollective identities, and points British identity (Tolia-Kelly 2001; Tolia-Kelly 2002). \nThese testimonies of migration are used to formulate maps of migration and \ndescriptions which contextualise South Asian positioning within their residence in \nEngland. The inscription of these other landscapes within the cultures of the everyday \nenables the valued environmental relationships, and connections to lived landscapes \nof the past, to be recovered. In recording the variety of landscapes that British Asians \nhave encountered in their migratory route, the maps are essential records of \n 4 \nidentification are examined in the considering of the material cultures of gardening \nand the organic. As cultures which provide direct contact with territory, and soil in the \nhome, they are important in grounding a sense of British Asianess. The role of \nmemory in this process is important in grounding a culture of landscape as being a \nminds eye image of past environments.  \n \nResearch Methodology \nThe research materials were gathered while working with groups of British Asian \nwomen in North-West London, over a period of twenty weeks. Other attempts at \ngroup work within the Asian community have failed (Burgess 1996) because of the \nperceived reluctance of the British Asian groups to committing to a series of sessions \nwith researchers and a lack of trust. My history of working within the Boroughs of \nHarrow and Brent enabled me to recruit mixed groups of British Asian women. The \ndecision to limit the research to women was to enable women\u201fs voices, normally \nmarginalized within and without the British Asian community to be recorded in \nacademic writing. Many feminist geographers have paved the way in conducting \nresearch with excluded members of society using reflexive and empowering research \nmethods [Barbour, 1999 #3; Dwyer, 1993 #36; England, 1994 #30; Patai, 1991 #35; \nRose, 1997 #58; Valentine, 1997 #38; Wilkinson, 1999 #6]. Mohammed [2001 #953] \nis especially eloquent on the complex positioning of the Asian researcher working \nwith Asian women. Here, I do not claim any cultural authority, but to simply \nacknowledge that my positioning within the community which has allowed me access, \nand a sense of common ground in terms of diasporic identification. The nature of the \ngroup methods used to situate the women\u201fs geographical knowledge and values \nwithin their biographies allowed me to record intense, intimate, and emotional \n 5 \nconnections not normally engaged with. However, there are dangers that this \nsituatedness could create \u201cseparate\u201d, and \u201cessential\u201d understandings of lives that are \nnot linked dialectically to social systems of knowledge, power and lived experience \n(Harvey 1992). The in-depth group method in combination with a home interview \neffectively aimed to allow the women to become conscious creators of their own \nidentification within a set of social spaces including their homes, which offered a \nmaterial rather than abstract context. These contexts ensured that the transcripts \nformed a record of the group s social understanding and values in situ of their homes \nand community groups. \n \nThe groups\u201f sharing of their biographical testimonies in the first stage allowed me to \ndevelop understanding of complex values, practices and codes among mixed Hindu, \nMuslim, Gujarati, Pakistani and Bangladeshi, groups of working class and middle-\nclass women, with added caste differences. Within the process I remained reflexive \nand my own biography was not hidden. The group dynamic allowed a dynamic \nresponse to the research agenda, and thus shaped it. The second stage of research \nincluded an interview at home, led by the individual woman herself. This enabled her \nto talk through the importance of certain materials as triggers for environmental \nmemories. These interviews allowed women to reflect on actual biographical \nlandscape connections rather than abstract ideas. Specific objects and textures (visual, \nmaterial, organic) held meaning through their presence in the home, and were not \nseparate from the political, economic, and social negotiations of post-colonial identity \nin Britain. They were critical in enfranchising them to the new territory of citizenship \n(Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981; Mehta and Belk 1991). The women\u201fs \nfocus on cultures of nature and grounding is represented in section two of this paper. \n 6 \n \nTelling tales : journeying through British Asian landscapes  \nThe research process mapped the lives of twenty two women. The social context of \nthe migration stories led the women to talk through each other\u201fs past lives, and the \nplaces, landscapes and natures they missed, loved or simply valued. Here are have \nincluded two biographies which reflect the stories behind the maps produced from the \nbiography sessions in stage one. (This material forms the data for Figures 1 and 2). \nThese biographies are the lived context for the women\u201fs current geographical \nrelationships centred in Britain, connecting them across the globe. \n \nBeena - Born India 1933, arrived U.K. 1990. \nBeena - \"The British have scattered our people across the whole globe. Isn't that \nright\" \n \nBeena's migration route is simple. She came to the U.K. in the 1990s from India and \nher identity is embedded in remembered landscapes of India and Bangladesh. Her \nmigration route arises from the race politics of partition and communalism in the \nPunjab. Beena was born in 1933, in Hoshaipur (North West of Punjab and Himachal \nPradesh), India. As a Muslim in a Hindu state she was vulnerable during partition. \nHer father was a doctor of medicine and owned a lot of land. She recalls her small \nhometown of Charshankar very fondly, especially the lush mango groves and banana \nplantations. They lived in a seven-story building owned by her father. He also owned \nland in Madaripur, Bangladesh, and she made many journeys with him when he \nvisited to oversee it. Beena was married at 14, but her husband died at an early age, \nleaving her and her children destitute. As a woman, she had not inherited land from \n 7 \nher father, and her husband had been a professional with no capital. She worked for a \nwhile breaking rocks and other labouring. Then she set up a business selling sugar and \ndry goods. To aid her family, a cousin rented her land to farm until her children \nbecame of age. In 1989, Beena became a Member of Parliament for Faisalbad, serving \nunder Benizeer Bhuto (before she became Prime Minister of Pakistan). When things \nwent badly for Bhuto, she fled to Pakistan, with her whole family. She came to the \nU.K. 10 years ago, followed eventually by her children. Beena has no means of return \nto India because she is at risk of political persecution. Whilst in England, she \ncomplains of a reduced social network compounded by unemployment.  \n \nShanta - born in Jinja (Uganda) in 1938, arrived London 1985. \nShanta describes her closeness with Uganda as a feeling of \u201ebeing at peace\u201f. She has \nmemories of walking in the green hilly landscapes, surrounded by trees and eating \nfoods such as mogo (cassava). The streets were quiet with few cars. She describes a \nfondly remembered, idyllic childhood. After marriage, she left Jinja (Uganda) to go to \nNairobi (Kenya). Shanta flew for the first time, to Malawi in 1972, when she was \nmarried. Here, the more conservative Hindu community constrained women to focus \non domestic life and responsibilities. Shanta describes herself as being frightened and \ndisempowered as a new bride entering Malawi society; her values were scrutinised on \na daily basis as were the clothes that she wore, her make-up, and the way she ran her \nhousehold. The family lived in Blantyre, the suburbs to the commercial capital of \nLimbe. They lived opposite the President's home. Shanta describes a contented life; \nMalawi had only one main shopping street, but had the luxuries of middle class living. \nShe remembers quite distinctly that leisure time was really enjoyable because of their \nregular family picnics trips to Lake Malawi. She describes it as a beautiful place \n 8 \nwhere there are the \u201eThick falls\u201f. This is her ideal place; the gramophone is on, the \nchildren are playing in the water and food is plentiful. Shanta moved to England in the \n1985. On returning to Malawi recently on holiday, she found things had changed. The \nLake was infected with bilharzia and the beaches were littered and ruined. She found \nthe two-hour journey to the Lake quite arduous because of the intense heat and \nhumidity. \n \nThe journeys undertaken by these two women show the diversity of the women\u201fs \nexperiences but also the strength of the community. The strength of connection is \nenough to resist erasure through the experiences of forgetting, settling, and \ndisctancing in Britain (Clifford 1997, 255). The migratory journey is a point of \ncommonality, holding them together in their description of themselves as \u201eAsians\u201f, \nbut represents the geographical breadth and scope of the diaspora. Within the group, \nShanta\u201fs testimony about Lake Malawi resulted in other women recalling Victoria \nFalls (Zimbabwe), and Lake Nakuru (Kenya). The women shared these experiences as \nif they were common. The weather, the heat and the significance of family leisure \ntrips were factors in treating each other\u201fs recollections as similar and the same. Group \ndiscussion brings to life the significance of the migration routes in the everyday \npolitics of being and belonging. The process of talking through these remembered \nterritories and environments created a group collage of memories and identifications \nwith these places and moments, which formed a shared 'territory of culture' (Tolia-\nKelly 2001). Individual stories resonated with the group as a whole, serving to map \nthe group\u201fs commonalities through the experience of migration. Together, the women \ntrace places of emotional and psychological importance, these were tinged with \n 9 \nnostalgia and sometimes expressed symbolic landscapes rather than a real site of \nexperience.  \n \nMap 1 - Women\u201fs migration routes \nMap 2 - Parental Migration Routes \n \nMaps 1 and 2, show the women\u201fs migration routes to London in a period when the \nBritish Empire was contracting. They represent the relationships between colonial \nsubjects and the spectrum of countries controlled by the British state. The routes \nsignify the effect economic and labour policies of the colonial administrators between \nthe continents of Africa, Asia and Europe, as well as the mobility of Asian males in \nthis period. The maps show a set of active associations for the women with different \nlandscapes through which they navigate, negotiate, and \"arrive\". In Map 1, a \ntriangular pattern is shown of travel between India to East Africa to the U.K - some \nhave migrated directly to the U.K. from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, and others \nfrom East Africa to Europe. This is very different to other \u201edouble migrants\u201f (Bhachu \n1985). Indian migration was limited to two or three states. At that time the women \nfrom Pakistan and Bangladesh arrived to join men already settled here (Anwar 1979; \nAnwar 1985). Within Africa, the routes are limited to Uganda, Kenya, and Malawi. \n(Tanzania was also a common place of residence, but is not represented in this \nparticular sample of individuals).  \n \nMap 2 records the women's parents' migration patterns to East Africa during the \n1930s and 1940s. Grandparents journeyed there from 1880 onwards, but mostly came \nin the 1920s and 1930s. Many parents had known a life in each of three continents \n 10 \nand would have been part of the initial entrepreneurial business and agricultural \ncommunities established in British East Africa. The representation of fathers' \nmigration routes shows varied settlement patterns and denotes the start of East \nAfrican settlement. The women in the groups worked from memory giving \napproximate dates of settlement. The role of Asian migrants in this period of time was \nto carve our new economic landscapes in East Africa. The Asians were deemed to be \na source of entrepreneurship and were positioned as racial superiors to the Black \nAfican population (Brah). The politics of their race-positioning influenced the \ngeographies of their cultural and environmental experiences and practices. \nLandscapes in the colonies were shaped and figured through the particular identity-\npositioning of Asians, within colonial discourse. These in turn influence race-\ngeographies, post-colony, in Britain. \n \nSocial Memory and British Asian identities. \nWhilst living in Britain the women\u201fs current lives are dialectically linked to their past \nenvironments as indicated in the maps above. Connections with these environments \nare woven into the fabric of everyday living. The following section of discussion \nreveals how their environmental memories of Asia and East Africa operate in their \nsenses of being here. \n  \nShazia \u2013When I go back home, I become what I used to be.  \nDarshna \u2013 What else is there apart from your family?  \nShazia \u2013 It\u201fs the air. . . It\u201fs the smell. I mean that  . .For me . .that\u201fs a maybe you all \ngo there and think it\u201fs all so dirty, it\u201fs so foggy. I get asthma, I get this, I get that .  . . \n.but for me you know the heat, the smell, when I get off the plane I feel Ahhh . . \n 11 \nWhen I come back, I tell Lalit (her husband) \u201cThere\u201fs no noise on the road, there\u201fs no \npeople on the road . . . it\u201fs just like a dead place you can ride for miles and not see \nanother human being where as there, you step out of the house and there are millions \nof people all around you. \n \nHere Shazia is talking through a sense of remembers a connection with the physical \nlandscape of India. In contrast the landscape in Britain is alienating; the air is cold and \nthe streets less densely populated. Her comparison reflects a physical alienation from \nBritish social landscape, and the air itself and is underlined with a sense of \nmarginality from social intercourse on the street. \n \nFor British Asians there is a complex relationship with British nation identity. \nHistorically, their racialised positioning within Empire and beyond has figured them \nas outside British political identity: the Black-English subjugated and marginalized by \nexclusive, and partial nationalist politics (Gilroy 1987; Gilroy 1993). For these groups \nthe preserving of social memory becomes a political act. Remembering the landscape \nand the air itself contribute to a grounded sense of self, located within memories of \npast environments. Social memory acts as an adhesive force, sustained through rituals, \nand everyday cultural practices. These sensory triggers in the everyday make a past \nterritory tangible. Individual recollections often have resonance amongst the whole \ngroup. Social memory in the South Asian diaspora, is constitutive a collage of stories, \nembedded in environments and landscapes, thus forming a \u201eterritory\u201f of cultural \nhistory and identity. In the absence of formal historical inclusion, memorialisation and \nheritage in this form are increasingly part of the imaginative realm and are maintained \nthrough the sensual, iconographic, textural, and aural signifiers within domestic visual \n 12 \nand material cultures. Textures in the home become connecting points back to past \nlandscapes, as well being a source of reflection of stories about Asian history and \nlandscapes. Here, the textures referenced include soil, plants and childhood gardens \nwhich are often sources of links to landscapes abroad and a medium for sustaining a \nsense of self identity.  \n \nMemory, Landscape and Placing \nPsychologists have considered the location of memory in our construction of self and \nhave traced the mechanisms and processes of memory within the context of life \nstages, trauma and socialisation (Conway 1997). Memory frames, and folds into our \ncontact with environments in a myriad of ways, sustaining our sense of the past, \nfracturing our sense of place now, and offers a continuous source of dialogue between \nmultiple space-times. Memory is effectively part of the landscape (Lowenthal and \nPrince 1965; Lowenthal 1979; Lowenthal 1985), however it sits as a dynamic and \npowerful tool for the creation, sustenance and disruption of our sense of self within \neveryday geographies. Texturally, the scent, sound, taste, and texture of memory \ncontextualise our body experiences within past experiences of dwelling, environment \nand places of being. Home for migrant groups is a transitory experience, therefore a \nsite-specific study of memories located in the space of home-making, and \nenfranchisement to the territory of Britain, allows for the study of memories which \noperate as significant in the creation of a rooting and belonging in Britain, for British \nAsians. By considering the dynamic force of memory as a placing mechanism we can \nestablish a conceptual frame for understanding post-colonial identity as it is figured \nthrough place, nature and landscape. Textures in the home signify memory and can be \ninterrogated as a store of cultural co-ordinates of actual routes of identification, for the \n 13 \nBritish Asian diaspora. The biographical migration flows, mapped in section one are \ncritical in understanding geographical connections that relate to the negotiation of \nmodern diasporic identities. The process of placing is involved in the figuring of \nidentity for migrants. \u201ePlacing\u201f has been theorised by phenomenological and humanist \ngeographers [Relph, 1976 #142] to address the way that we live and be within \nenvironment, including sensory engagements with the environment. Placing through \nthe senses offers us a matrix of textures through we situate ourselves and in turn are \nourselves positioned. Sensory memory thickens these matrices of sensory engagement \nby the presence of other time-spaces that assist in our being, dwelling and \nidentification with place, home, and landscape. Sensory memories as expressed here, \nare not simply contexts to memory, but are dialogic connections with the dialectics of \npost-colonial social memory as expressed in contemporary environments.  \n \nThis dialectical relationship between memory and placing is critical for diasporic \ngroups who have migrated through varied landscapes, but who have also varied \npolitical connections with territory and national identity. By using the refractory \nqualities that materials of cultures offer I have attempted to place post-colonial \nmigrants within a matrix of valued connections that actively connect individuals with \nplace, natures and landscape. The site of a red rose cultivated in a domestic garden in \nBritain can uncover the geographical co-ordinates through which identity is \nconstituted. A rose can refract a memory of a past home, or a connection to a \nsymbolised sense of past national affiliation to Kenya, but also be central in a present \nhome, in securing a sense of British Asianess (see Tolia-Kelly 2001). Manjula, below \ndescribes her memory of the East African landscape signified through a rose plant. \nThe loss of connection with the rose reflects the distance and loss of contact with the \n 14 \ngardens left behind. Remembering this black rose, links her back to a collage of \nnarratives about planting practices, the colours and the landscape of plantations in \nAfrica.  \n \nManjula \u2013\u201e We had a beautiful house in Kampala. We had huge gardens all round. \nWe had so many guava trees and mango trees and all. I still remember my sister sent \nme some rose bushes from Nairobi which I grew in the front garden, and one of them \nwas a black one. Black Rose. Just when it was coming into bud, I had to come here to \ndo my studies. I thought when I go back I'll see my garden, I was so looking forward \nto seeing it again, with the new lawn and the new roses\u201f. \n \nFor many migrant communities material possessions are lost or left behind in the \nprocess of migration. The effect of this loss results in any preserved cultures in the \nU.K. are imbued with an enhanced meaning and value. As remnants of the past home, \nor bought as souvenirs after settlement in Britain, these have a significant role in the \nprocess of location, belonging and placing for this group. \n \nNeela - \u201c it\u201fs just nice to have something from the past. . . .mostly, we left things as \nthey were. Because all you could bring were suitcases. I remember the house keys and \nthe shop keys we gave it at the police station and the car keys we gave it to the driver. \nSo it was like you were passing it on . . .We gave a few things away because we knew \nwe couldn\u201ft bring much. . . Still in my mind I believed it was temporary because I \ncouldn\u201ft see another life for my parents starting anew . . . .I thought, so there would \nalways be a home (in Kenya) but it never happened . . . .You know what it was so \n 15 \ntraumatic, I\u201fve really tried to block that out. I remember snatches but I really blocked \nit out of my mind . . . .We didn\u201ft have anything.\u201d \n \nThe women\u201fs parents left countries where they had built their lives and businesses, \nfrom clearing land to developing new markets and building economies. For some of \nthe families the shock was too much to bear. Individuals dealt with this in different \nways. For three of the women\u201fs fathers, Uganda became something that the household \ndid not talk about. For others the strategy was to believe themselves to be moving to \nthe U.K. only temporarily.  \n \nsensory memories and landscape. \nThere are a myriad of sensual memories we carry around with us that resonate with \npast environments, people and events. Scents, sounds, tastes, aesthetics and textures, \nare evoked through remembering the past. These body-memories (Edgerton 1995) are \nrefracted through contact with materials in the present. They operate as a gateway into \nother environments, moments and social experiences. A sphere of sensual references \nthat reflect past events and sensory textures are recalled when talking through the \npractices of gardening and contact with soil, plants, flowers and food Thus sensory \nmemories trigger a collective connectedness to a \u201eterritory of culture\u201f which is shared. \nwithin a collective group of South Asians who have travelled separately in their \njourney to Britain. The multi-sensory nature of these connections are important \nelements of geographical cultures of being (Urry 1990; Macnaghten and Urry 1998) \nand contribute to processes of identification with place, environment and landscapes \nof belonging. The memories of past environments are mobile and transportable \n(Bohlin 1998; Lovell 1998) as a portmanteau (Crosby, 1986) of cultural memory. \n 16 \nThis is where domestic cultures create a set of historical narratives which act as both a \nstore of refractive memorials of past stories, and gateways to body-memories. \n \nFor many of the women, the effect of migration is evident in their attitudes and \nrelationships with nature and climate; the heat of the sun, the dryness of the air and \nthe brightness of the sky are vivid memories as migration has taken them out of this \necological context. The environmental differences between equatorial cities in the \nAfrican savannah, dry tropical forests and Indian desert and coastal biomes are \nevidenced in their descriptions. Arrival and adjustment are just as much about \nadjustment to climate as they are about making a home in a new nation. The shift in \nphysical environment influences them psychologically and physically; the weather is \na feature of their isolation and a feature of the obstacles they have to overcome to \nsustain day to day living. The women\u201fs ecological engagements highlight an \norientation towards particular environmental textures. A set of ecological aesthetics \ncan be traced through their connectedness. The women\u201fs recollections include those \nintimate connections with kitchen-gardens and more formal national landscapes. Their \nnarratives describe real, imaginary and symbolic relationships with natural textures. \nThese memories are transplanted to the practices of cultivating gardens in their homes \nin Britain. Often, this important process of rooting is replicating the practices of \nplanting abroad in places such as Kenya, India, Uganda.  \n \nThese recollections re-create and import \u201eother\u201f environments into England, but also \nre-contextualise organic icons of life in another place. These narratives express the \ncomplicatedness of migration and dislocation, they can also reflect the pleasure that \nthe women get from plants, trees and landscape in England; English roses are \n 17 \nreminders of roses in Uganda, or fuschias triggers for memories of bougainvilleas in \nAfrica and India. In the testimonies of the women, certain plants, trees and textures \nreoccur - papaya, guava, mango, palms, bougainvilleas, jasmine, gardenias, hibiscus \nflowers, and the colour of the soil are particular landscape icons which are metonyms \nfor other continental ecologies. These reflect the experience of growing up in Indian \nsub-continent or Africa prior to living in London, as well their active engagement \nwith English plants and flowers in England and abroad, for quite often plants abroad \nwere introduced by the British. The women in the group cultivate African and Indian \nspecies too. In East Africa gardening was not only a pleasurable pastime, but very \nimportant to the women\u201fs sense of their feminine role in contributing to the household \nlarder, as well as considered as creative and aesthetically improving to the fabric of \nthe home. This is a culture of ensuring a culture of fecundity in the home landscape. \nBelow is an example of how the ecology and environment are recalled, some gardens \nare no longer actively cultivated, but neglected. The women try to recreate these \nremembered ecological textures in their own gardens in England. On visiting the \nwomen\u201fs homes, the women talked of attempts at recreating past gardens through \ngrowing palms, guavas, sweetcorn, and flowers. These practices are attempts at \nplanting materials that they engaged with in their past homes, this process was \nevidence of a need to cultivate a new landscape in Britain relevant to their experience \nof migration.  \n \nBhanu - \u201cIn Kenya, I used to grow many things in my garden, not here. I tried here \nonce, a coconut tree. It didn\u201ft grow very much, it grew up to there (12 inches) and \nafter some time it dies off. In Kenya we had ferns and some flowering plants, like Bird \nof Paradise plant which is very popular in Kenya. And some others . my father \n 18 \nhimself, had grown pomegranate, paw paws, guavas, mangos, even a coconut tree. . . \nWe used to get lovely fruit like custard apples, sitaful. It was a big garden. I think I \nhave gone on my fathers side. I like it. Yes I grow Kenyan flowers like I used to grow \ngeraniums, and Begonia, those are the ones I always bring (back).\u201d \n \nMobility seems to enhance the need for a familiar landscape sometimes even \nparticular plants and trees. Lalita has the greatest geographical mobility, having \ntravelled globally with her husbands multinational firm. Lalita tells the group that \nhaving a palm means so much to her that she has to take an artificial one with her \neverywhere she goes. The plant\u201fs presence makes it home wherever Lalita travels. It \nis an essential artefact. It does not matter whether it is real or \u201cfresh\u201d as she describes, \nbut the look of it, the authentic texture of the palm tree has to be the same. The \nplanting of the palm ensures safe settlement in the new home. It is part of the laying \ndown of roots, and aesthetically provides a familiar corner. This \u201elandscaped\u201f corner \nin the garden offers a respite from newness and strangeness. It is a symbol of \nconstancy which stabilises and settles amongst the continued uprooting and moving. It \nalso resonates with the soil of India, the layout of her father\u201fs garden and the \ngreenness that she is used to. The mini palm tree for Lalita emanates homeliness, and \nit allows for some level of belonging and rooting and thus inscribes the new territory \nof the home, with the old values home; it has a productive and reflective presence. \nLalita\u201fs palm in this picture is a plastic version of the original minipalm she had in her \nhome. The fact that it is plastic preserves it from deterioration and sustains its primary \nuse in that it provides the necessary colour, and texture and form which makes her \nfeel at home. \n \n 19 \nFigure 3 \u2013 Lalita\u201fs Minipalm \n \nThe aesthetics of flowering plants and gardens are symbolic memorialised \nrelationships with a 'foreign' ecology which resonate with a sense of loss. Elevated to \nthe status of \u201ehyper-real\u201f; these ecologies become embossed, exaggerated and \nenriched with a luminosity of colour, through the lens of distance. The body-\nmemories of past contact with scents, tastes and touch, ensure a heightened sensitivity \nto the characteristics and aesthetics of the past. The colours in the women's memories \nare vibrant and defined, the smells are pungent and immediate, and these evocations \nare pervasive in the women's everyday sightings of similar vegetation. Jasmine is an \nexam0ple of a scent that permeates throughout the women's memories of India, and \nEast Africa. The women recall its look and its presence is recorded as being part of \nthe everyday textures of being in India, East Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The \nflowers are deemed irreplaceable as the women have made efforts to grow the \nflowering plant here; the flower heads in memories were smaller, and the scent always \nmore pungent. The pungent, intense scent of ripening guavas has a similar effect. \nManjula is reminded the life on the tea estates in Uganda, where there was a strong \nsmell of fresh guava each morning outside her kitchen window. \n \nManjula \u201eOh it has very dark green leaves, and it has a nice lemony, sweet and lime \nmixed smell. Guava is very strong. They'll be ready now. In the farms they are ready \nby August. But we start plucking them in June, July because we have so many, and we \neat them . ..we like them raw.\u201f \n \n 20 \nThese remembered homely textures become a form of sustenance, intimate local \necologies like this are celebrated by Mabey (1980, 37) as being integral to human \nculture in ensuring human well-being. Local textures in the forms of specific trees, \nplants as well as the specific local flora and fauna are essential to feelings of \nbelonging and senses of locality. These valued environmental memories bridge \ncultures of well being and include food cultures of sweet potatoes; green banana, \nsweetcorn, grilled aubergine, and cassava. Food bridges the geographical distance \nbetween here and there. The importing of vegetables such as cassava offers a direct \nmaterial connection to the soil of East Africa. It is an organic memento of a land that \nwas home; the journey of the guavas in Wembley has been the same as for the women \nwho deem them special. The materials of packing are as important as the fruit \nremembered; rough sackcloth, soft woods and the boxing materials are productive for \nthe re-memorialisation or past landscapes. The scent of a mango is a trigger for the \n\u201ereal\u201f remembered smell; its own smell is sometimes occluded by the pungent \nmemories that the women hold in relation to all the mango varieties available in East \nAfrica, and the Indian sub-continent.  \n \nThe texture, colour and smell of soils are also remembered by the women in their \nnarratives as having properties not available in the soil here. There is romantic \nconsideration, a romanticised earth. Below is an example of where places are \nconflated; the soil of Kenya then becomes a memory of Uganda. Shazia\u201fs memory is \nof Kenya\u201fs rich fertile soil, which has a scent when wet, on memory of this Bharti is \ntransported back to the Uganda. There is an elevation, a reverence and a feeling of the \nsublime which is repeated in the other women's experiences. \n \n 21 \nShazia \u2013 \u201eI think when I went to Kenya about three years ago. I can't remember, and \nthe red soil. It reminded me straight away of the soil in Uganda. .You don't get that. \nIt's rich. . . Is it only in Uganda that it's red? Because in Kenya it's . .\u201d \nBharti \u2013\u201cBut in Uganda it's even richer. I remember when it rained all the water, \nmuddy water, we don't go out in that and walk in that . . .And the smell you get when \nit rains ...I love that.\u201f \nManjula \u2013 \u201eWe won't get that smell here!\u201f \nBhanu \u2013 \u201eI compare the soil (when gardening), the soil was so nice in Kenya (laughs) \nIt's really nice soft soil. Reddish sort of, here it's all clay.. . .It is hard work. Well \nobviously in Kenya, you don't do it all yourself. Mainly we have a gardener, but yes \nthey sometimes feel it's so easy to grow fruits. .and the soil is very good. It's not \ndifficult to plant trees you know.\u201f \n \nIn the women\u201fs memories the soil is remembered as fertile, almost magical, where \npapaya trees could not help but sprout, growing was easy, digging was easy, and \ngardening was not laborious. It is always the case that the soil in England cannot \nmatch up. The soil in England is hard work, and difficult. This is symbolic of their \nstruggle to settle; their skin colour and bodies occluding an easy identification with \nBritishness.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper I have mapped the Landscapes of migration for South Asian women, \nwhich reflect the encountered landscapes and environments of a racialised post-\ncolonial group, living in the U.K. Mapping these migratory geographies holds an \nimportant place in recognising factors which influence landscape values of migratory \n 22 \npopulations in the U.K. The connections with these geographies of migration are \ncontinually figured in day to day life by the South Asian population where memories \nof landscapes constitute social narratives of heritage and cultural identity. Most \nimportantly memories of past landscapes have an impact on landscapes in Britain. \nThe British landscape is itself shifting in relation to this process of the presencing of \nthese physical memories. The practice of gardening has become an expression of \nAsianess in England, this has materialised the biographical experiences and ecological \nknowledges of the women who have moved into suburban scene. The landscaping of \nthis scene is inscribed with echoes of past ecological memories. These subtle \nexpressions of migration through garden texture and aesthetics are counter to 'native' \nplanting as expressed in contemporary writings about preservation of a native planting \naesthetic (Buchan 1998; Thomas 1998). These ecological paradigms of 'native' and \n'non-native' species are politicised further in debates on ecological racism (Agyeman \n1990; Agyeman 1991). For non-native gardeners however, flowers are cultivated \nbecause they remind the grower of the 'other' place of being, but are not necessarily of \nthat 'other' place. When South Asians migrated here, they came with their own \nimagined ecological portmanteau (Crosby, 1986). These reflect cultures of \nremembering and reconnecting with the soil, land and ecology of other nations. An \necological oral history is inscribed in the urban landscape and of suburbia, as part of \nreinscribing multisensory memories at home in England. These inscriptions include \nthose national iconographies of identification and the intimate textures of the local left \nbehind. These include the plant species, and the particular aesthetics of the biome of \nresidence. This is a vernacular thread in the construction of new national cultures, \nafter migration, layered upon the bigger discourses of nation and iconography of the \nnation. The placing of these textures in the geographical imagination and memory of \n 23 \ndiasporic groups can contribute greatly to understanding the process making home. \nBright colours and familiar scents contribute to the cultivation of familiar landscapes \non the domestic scale. The planting of begonias, roses, jasmine, and coriander, in their \ndifferent ways, are enfranchising environmental practices. They bound the women in \nan embodied way to an unalienated sense of being in-place. The gardens represent the \nwomen\u201fs new hybrid cultures. They store icons of the past, but also root the women \nfirmly in the territory of Britain.  \n \nSocial memories presented here, are a means of routing diasporic groups, but also \nillustrate the continuing influence of landscape and intimate ecologies on \nidentification with places. Migration, (of plant and human species) disrupts \nessentialist notions of dwelling, belonging and native species. For migratory groups \nhowever, experiences of nature are equally significant in their identification with local \nnatures and national landscapes, as are their relationships with heritage narratives. As \na result new local ecologies emerge and are expressed through cultural practice as a \nprocess resettlement, and re-rooting. They are material expressions of British Asian \nmemory and cultures of enfranchisement. Body-memories are shards of other \nenvironments, evoked in the practices of everyday living collage together as a \nlandscape of nostalgia, but also as a memory-history of Imperial landscapes, \nintimately experienced by post-colonial populations in the U.K. \n \nThis relationship between past lived environments, imagined and idealised ones and \npresent lived landscapes have been termed a triadic relationship, pertinent to a post-\ncolonial positioning theorised by Brah (1996) and Safran (1991). Materials of culture \nsuch as organic materials in the home, resonate points of both geographic, and \n 24 \nhistorical identification, which are significant in the affirmation of racialised identities \nin the British South Asian community. These materials of connection represent nodal \npoints in a biographical journey which, in turn, are symbolic of the political dynamic \nof making home \u201eelsewhere\u201f. These materials of culture are often situated as materials \nof negotiation of citizenship, belonging and national identity, in the process of \n\u201ecentring\u201f and \u201epositioning\u201f, after migration. They act as points of resistance to \nexclusive dominant cultures as well as offering points of engagement to an \nenfranchising idyll located in the past. These are memories which have shaped \ncontemporary post-colonial domestic landscapes in Britain, materially. Privileging \nthese cultural materials and practices in geographical research offer researchers a \nmeans through which to examine the value of landscape itself to post-colonial \ncommunities living in Britain. Landscape memory, as embedded in domestic cultures \nare presented here essential components of an attainable and inclusive approach to \nlandscape research with post-migratory communities.  \n \nAgyeman, J.
