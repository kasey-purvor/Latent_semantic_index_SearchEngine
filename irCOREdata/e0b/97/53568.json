Introduction\n[2] Sea ice around Antarctica plays a crucial role in\nmodulating ecosystems and climate; however, it remains a\npoorly constrained component in model projections of past\nand ongoing climate change. This is largely because routine\nsatellite monitoring of sea ice only began in the 1970s and\nits strong interannual variability has meant that long\u2010term\ntrends over this short interval have been difficult to discern\n[Zwally et al., 2002; Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008]. Over\nthe 1978\u20132007 interval, satellite observations show that sea\nice extent around Antarctica has increased by a small\namount (increasing at a rate of 1.0% decade\u22121; p < 0.05).\nAlthough this increasing trend is statistically significant, a\nlong control run of a coupled climate model suggests that\nthis recent increase in Antarctic sea ice extent may still be\nwithin the bounds of natural climate variability [Turner et al.,\n2009].When examined at a regional scale, the strongest trends\nin the satellite record of Antarctic sea ice are an increase in\nannual sea ice extent in the Ross Sea (4.6% decade\u22121; p < 0.05)\nand a decrease in annual sea ice extent in the Amundsen\u2010\nBellingshausen Seas (\u22126.6% decade\u22121; p < 0.01). This dipole\npattern of increasing and decreasing sea ice extent in the\nRoss and Amundsen\u2010Bellingshausen seas is thought to be\ndriven by strengthening of the cyclonic atmospheric flow\nover the Amundsen Sea (i.e., the Amundsen Sea Low).\nModel studies suggest that much of the increase in cyclonic\nflow since \u223c1980 may be attributed to circulation changes\ncaused by stratospheric ozone depletion [Turner et al.,\n2009].\n[3] Prior to satellite monitoring, direct information about\nAntarctic sea ice is extremely sparse, and this has prompted\nattempts to produce reconstructions of 20th century sea ice\nchange using historical information from whaling ships and\nthe chemistry of ice cores. Records of the position of whale\ncatches, which are assumed to have occurred near the ice\nedge, have been used to estimate that Antarctic\u2010average\nsummer sea ice extent retreated southward by 2.8\u00b0 during\nthe mid\u201020th century [de la Mare, 1997]. However, the use\nof this whaling data as a sea ice indicator has been challenged\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2Division of Hydrologic Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno,\nNevada, USA.\n3Instituto Ant\u00e1rctico Argentino, CRICYT, Mendoza, Argentina.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2010JD014644\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, D23101, doi:10.1029\/2010JD014644, 2010\nD23101 1 of 9\ndue to potential biases caused by changes in the species of\nwhales caught, spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the\ncoverage of the whaling data, and offsets between satellite and\nchart records of sea ice extent [Vaughan, 2000; Ackley et al.,\n2003]. A recent re\u2010examination of the whaling catch records\nalongside early ship charts of Antarctic sea ice extent has\nsuggested a revised regionally weighted sea ice retreat of \u223c1.7\u00b0\nfrom the early (1930 to mid\u20101950s) to the late (1971\u20131987)\n20th century [de la Mare, 2009]. Regional analysis also sug-\ngests that themagnitude of sea ice retreat has differedmarkedly\naroundAntarctica [Cotte and Guinet, 2007; de laMare, 2009],\nalthough the regional changes produced using direct chart\nobservations do still differ in detail from those derived from\nwhaling records.\n[4] The chemistry of Antarctic ice cores provides an\nalternate way to reconstruct past sea ice changes on a range\nof time scales [Curran et al., 2003; Wolff et al., 2003; Dixon\net al., 2005; Rothlisberger et al., 2010]. For high accumu-\nlation sites around coastal Antarctica, it has been proposed\nthat changes in the methanesulphonic acid (MSA; CH3SO3H)\nconcentration of ice cores may provide a proxy for exam-\nining past sea ice changes, potentially going back thousands\nof years. The only source of MSA in Antarctic ice cores\ncomes from the atmospheric oxidation of dimethylsulphide,\nwhich is derived from marine phytoplankton that live in the\nsea ice zone [Welch et al., 1993; Curran and Jones, 2000].\nThe seasonal melting of sea ice promotes blooms of these\nsea ice algae, leading to increased emissions of dimethyl-\nsulphide to the atmosphere. For this reason, it has been\nproposed that years of enhanced winter sea ice extent, and\nsubsequently enhanced sea ice algae blooms during seasonal\nsea ice melting, can lead to increased MSA being trans-\nported to near coastal ice cores in the following summer.\nThis proxy was utilized in the Law Dome ice core to infer a\n1.5\u00b0 retreat in winter sea ice extent since the 1950s [Curran\net al., 2003].\n[5] Similar positive relationships between ice core MSA\nrecords and Antarctic sea ice variability have now been\nidentified at a number of other near\u2010coastal sites in the Ross\nSea\/Indian Ocean sector of east Antarctica [Welch et al.,\n1993; Foster et al., 2006; Becagli et al., 2009]. However,\nin some locations, increased ice core MSA is not a reliable\nproxy for enhanced winter sea ice extent [Sun et al., 2002;\nAbram et al., 2007; Rhodes et al., 2009]. In the Weddell Sea\nand Dronning Maud Land region, it appears that transport\nstrength and direction have an important influence on the\nconcentration of ice core MSA [Fundel et al., 2006; Abram\net al., 2007], while the presence of a summer open water\npolynya in the Ross Sea is thought to dominate the inter-\nannual variability of MSA in the nearby Mount Erebus\nSaddle ice core [Rhodes et al., 2009]. Atmospheric chem-\nistry measurements also indicate that ice core MSA records\nfrom inland Antarctic Plateau sites may not be representa-\ntive of sea ice\u2010associated emissions of dimethylsulphide due\nto long transport distances and oxidation processes\n[Preunkert et al., 2008] and the influence of postdeposi-\ntional losses [Weller et al., 2004]. The potential for various\nfactors to influence the MSA signal preserved in ice cores\nhighlights the need for detailed site\u2010specific assessments of\nthe suitability of MSA as a sea ice proxy.\n[6] In this study we use a set of ice core records from\nthree sites along the western Antarctic Peninsula to inves-\ntigate the reliability of MSA records from this region as sea\nice proxies. We are then able to use these ice core records to\nexamine the history of 20th century changes in winter sea\nice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea, and how these compare\nto other 20th century climate records from the Antarctic\nPeninsula region and to sea ice reconstructions from other\nregions around the Antarctic continent.\n2. Methods\n[7] We use ice core MSA records from three sites\nextending along the western and northern Antarctic\nPeninsula (Table 1). The Beethoven Peninsula and Dyer\nPlateau cores were collected by the British Antarctic Survey\n[Mulvaney et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2008]. The core from\nJames Ross Island was drilled by an Argentinian\/French\nteam [Aristarain et al., 2004; McConnell et al., 2007].\nChronologies for each of these high\u2010resolution cores have\nbeen established by counting the clear annual cycles in water\nisotopes and trace chemistry and are verified by known\nvolcanic eruption events.\n[8] Measurements of MSA were made in a class\u2010100 clean\nlaboratory at the British Antarctic Survey using Dionex ion\nchromatographs [Littot et al., 2002; Abram et al., 2008].\nThe experimental setup used a DX2000 anion instrument,\nusing an AS17 4 mm column and KOH eluent that was run\nusing a gradient method ranging from 0.3 to 60 mmol L\u22121\nconcentration that optimized MSA separation. The MSA\nmeasurements were made at subannual resolution (approx-\nimately 28 samples\/year for Beethoven, 12 samples\/year for\nDyer, and 2 samples\/year for James Ross Island), and the\nresults were interpolated and averaged to produce annual\nresolution records of MSA centered about the MSA maxi-\nmum that occurs in the Austral summer (i.e., \u223cJuly\u2013June\nannual averages).\n[9] It has been shown that MSA can be lost from archived\nice cores during storage at \u221220\u00b0C [Smith et al., 2004; Abram\net al., 2008] due to a relatively high diffusion coefficient for\nMSA in ice [Roberts et al., 2009] that can result in a\ndecrease in the mean amount of MSA retained in the\nTable 1.

However, this mean loss does not destroy the\nrelative variability of the original MSA record if all samples\nhave a similar storage time and geometry [Abram et al.,\n2008; Roberts et al., 2009], and if detailed storage and ice\ngeometry information are available then the effects should\nbe able to be corrected using a 2\u2010D diffusion model [Roberts\net al., 2009]. The MSA measurements from the Beethoven\nPeninsula and early Dyer Plateau cores were made on\narchived ice samples refrozen in discrete bottles, a storage\nmethod that has been shown to prevent MSA loss [Abram\net al., 2008]. The MSA measurements on the more recent\nDyer Plateau core were completed within 18 months of core\ncollection, so postcollection MSA loss should also be neg-\nligible in this core. It is likely that the James Ross Island\ncore will have experienced some loss in the absolute amount\nof MSA, as it was analyzed for MSA after 9 years of frozen\nstorage. As this study uses only the normalized MSA records\nto look at relative variability of MSA, rather than absolute\nMSA concentrations, any postcollection loss of MSA should\nnot affect the results of this study [Abram et al., 2008;\nRoberts et al., 2009]. This is confirmed by earlier discrete\nmeasurements of MSA on a short section of the James Ross\nIsland core (13.8\u201329.5 m analyzed 3 years after collection),\nwhich show a similar temporal variability to the more recent\nMSA measurements used in this study.\n[10] The statistical significance of the reported linear cor-\nrelation results in this study are computed based on a 2\u2010sided\nt test. To take into account autocorrelation effects, these tests\nuse effective sample sizes that were estimated using the\ncorrection of: Neff = N (1 \u2212 rarb)\/(1 + rarb), where ra and rb\nare the lag\u20101 autocorrelation values for the two series\n[Bretherton et al., 1999; van Ommen and Morgan, 2010]. In\norder to assess the approximate magnitude of sea ice extent\nchange from the regional\u2010scale proxy records, a geometric\nmean regression technique was used (also known as reduced\nmajor axis regression) [Smith, 2009]. This method avoids\nthe assumption applied in ordinary least squares regression\nthat there is no error in the independent variable (in this\ncase, satellite sea ice extent records). The geometric mean\nregression method allows for error in both parameters by\ncalculating the line of best fit that minimizes the error in\nboth the x and y dimensions.\n3. Results\n[11] The James Ross Island, Dyer Plateau, and Beethoven\nPeninsula ice core MSA records each display similar pat-\nterns of MSA variability through their overlapping intervals\n(Figure 1a). In order to maximize this common environ-\nmental signal, the three records were normalized and aver-\naged to produce a stacked MSA record for the Antarctic\nPeninsula. Following the method applied in previous studies\n[Curran et al., 2003; Abram et al., 2007], the stacked MSA\nrecord was correlated with a compilation of the latitude of\nmaximum winter (August\u2013October average) sea ice extent\naveraged across 10\u00b0 sectors around Antarctica from the Joint\nIce Center (JIC) data set that begins in 1973 [Jacka, 1990].\nAfter taking into account autocorrelation of the MSA and\nsea ice time series, the western Antarctic Peninsula stacked\nMSA record is found to have a significant (>90% confi-\ndence) positive correlation with winter sea ice extent over a\n30\u00b0 sector of the adjacent Bellingshausen Sea that spans\nfrom 70\u00b0W to 100\u00b0W (Figure 1b). This provides an initial\nindication that in this region ice core records of MSA may\nbe a good proxy for reconstructing past changes in sea ice,\nwith years of increased (decreased) sea ice extent in the\nBellingshausen Sea marked by increased (decreased) MSA\ndeposition at the western Antarctic Peninsula ice core sites.\n[12] These findings were verified using the NASA boot-\nstrap satellite sea ice data set [Cavalieri and Parkinson,\n2008; Turner et al., 2009] that begins in 1979 and is\nknown to be more reliable than the JIC sea ice data set.\nSimilar positive correlations are found between our stacked\nAntarctic Peninsula MSA record and the NASA data for\nwinter sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea, although the\nlater start year of the NASA data set reduces the interval\navailable for establishing the significance of these positive\ncorrelations. A comparison of the JIC sea ice extent record\nwith an equivalent compilation of the NASA sea ice extent\ndata in 10\u00b0 longitude sectors further confirms the reliability\nof the JIC data across the 70\u00b0W\u2013100\u00b0W region where sig-\nnificant correlations exist with ice core MSA; here winter\nsea ice extent correlates strongly (r = 0.90) between the JIC\nand NASA sea ice data sets (see also section 4 and Figure 4a\nin section 4.2).\n[13] To further test the reliability of our ice core MSA\nrecords as a proxy for sea ice changes in the Bellingshausen\nSea, we next examined the meteorological conditions\nassociated with MSA variability at our Antarctic Peninsula\nice core sites. Using the European Centre for Medium\u2010\nRange Weather Forecasts Re\u2010Analysis data (ERA\u201040)\n[Uppala et al., 2005] for the interval after 1979 that is\nreliable for high southern latitudes [Marshall, 2003], we\nfirst plotted density maps for the 5 day back trajectories of\nprecipitation events at each of the ice core sites (Figure 1c)\n[Thomas and Bracegirdle, 2009]. At each ice core site, it is\nseen that the greatest density of precipitation\u2010bearing air\nparcels arrive from the adjacent Bellingshausen Sea region.\nThis precipitation source region occurs over the same geo-\ngraphical area where positive correlations are observed with\nsea ice extent (Figure 1b). This strongly supports the notion\nthat MSA preserved in our ice core records is derived pri-\nmarily from the sea ice margin in the Bellingshausen Sea.\n[14] Correlation of the western Antarctic Peninsula MSA\nrecord with the meteorological data from the National\nCenters for Environmental Prediction\/National Center for\nAtmospheric Research (NCEP\/NCAR) reanalysis fields since\n1979 [Kalnay et al., 1996] provides further evidence that\nMSA is a reliable sea ice proxy in the Bellingshausen Sea\nregion. Data from the NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis were averaged\nover annual increments spanning July\u2013June that match the\nAustral summer\u2010centered annual averages of the ice core\nMSA data. Negative correlations with surface air temperature\nin the Bellingshausen Sea indicate that increased MSA at our\nice core sites corresponds with cooler Bellingshausen Sea\nair temperatures (Figure 2a). Again, the location of these air\ntemperature anomalies in the Bellingshausen Sea (which\nwould be expected to also reflect changes in sea ice cover)\ncoincides with the region of maximum positive correlations\nbetween sea ice extent and the ice coreMSA stack (Figure 1b).\n[15] Additional correlation maps for sea level pressure and\nwind fields show that the physical processes driving the\nconnection between cool Bellingshausen Sea air tempera-\nABRAM ET AL.: 20TH CENTURY ANTARCTIC SEA ICE DECLINE D23101D23101\n3 of 9\ntures and increased ice core MSA are linked with a high\nsurface air pressure anomaly centered in the Amundsen Sea\n(Figure 2b). The wind fields associated with the high\npressure anomaly over the Amundsen Sea involve westerly\nwind anomalies that travel along the West Antarctic coast\n(Figure 2c) and continue northward along the Antarctic\nPeninsula (Figure 2d). This wind configuration brings cold\nAntarctic air over the Bellingshausen Sea, resulting in the\nprominent cool anomaly in the surface air temperature fields\nfrom the reanalysis data that corresponds with years of high\nMSA at our ice core sites. These wind fields are also\nfavorable for transporting MSA from high sea ice anomalies\nin the Bellingshausen Sea onshore to the ice core sites.\n[16] Together this analysis of our ice core MSA records\nalongside a variety of sea ice and meteorological data pro-\nvides strong evidence that MSA is a reliable proxy for\nchanges in sea ice in the adjacent Bellingshausen Sea. Using\nthe stacked ice core MSA as a proxy for changes in sea ice\nsince 1901 suggests that the Bellingshausen Sea has expe-\nrienced a marked loss of sea ice during the 20th century\n(Figure 3). A linear trend analysis calculated across the\nwhole 1901\u20131990 interval identifies a significant decreasing\ntrend of \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.03s decade\u22121 in the stacked MSA record.\nWhen this analysis is repeated over 50 year intervals, similar\nsignificant trends are found for the early (\u22120.12 \u00b1 0.06s\ndecade\u22121, 1901\u20131950) and late (\u20130.13 \u00b1 0.09s decade\u22121,\n1941\u20131990) halves of the 20th century. A prominent epi-\nsode of high MSA in the late 1950s means that the trend of\ndecreasing MSA is maximized when calculated over the\n1958\u20131990 interval (\u22120.34 \u00b1 0.18s decade\u22121). The sus-\ntained trends of decreasing MSA imply that the recent\ndecline in sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea observed using\nFigure 1.

Discussion\n4.1. Comparison With Records of 20th Century\nClimate Change on the Antarctic Peninsula\n[17] Our reconstruction of 20th century sea ice decline in\nthe Bellingshausen Sea is consistent with evidence of warming\nalong the adjacent Antarctic Peninsula. A statistically signifi-\ncant correlation (r = \u22120.37, p = 0.01) is observed between\nwarming July\u2013June annual mean air temperatures at Faraday\/\nVernadsky station and decreasing ice core MSA, and this is\nparticularly evident at decadal time scales (Figure 3). The\ndocumented warming at Faraday station has been suggested\nto be part of a continued warming trend since at least the\n1900s based on early exploration data [Jones, 1990]. Our\nstacked ice core record supports this notion that warming of\nthe Antarctic Peninsula has occurred throughout the 20th\ncentury, although perhaps with increased strength since\n\u223c1958. A similar pattern of 20th century climate change has\nbeen reported for the Gomez ice core from the southern end\nof the Antarctic Peninsula. At the Gomez site, the statisti-\ncally significant isotope\u2010derived warming trend began\naround 1900 [Thomas et al., 2009], with particularly strong\nincreases in temperature and snow accumulation observed\nsince \u223c1960 [Thomas et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2009].\n[18] Previous studies using satellite data and model\nsimulations have highlighted the deepening of the Amundsen\nSea Low as a likely driver of the observed warming of the\nFigure 3. The MSA record (thin black curve) derived from the three Antarctic Peninsula ice cores cor-\nrelates significantly with decreasing mean sea level pressure over the Amundsen Sea (green curve; NCEP\nreanalysis data for region 100\u00b0W\u2013140\u00b0W, 55\u00b0S\u201370\u00b0S, July\u2013June averages) [Kalnay et al., 1996] and with\nthe historical record of rising air temperature measured at Faraday\/Vernadsky station (thin purple curve;\ninverted; July\u2013June averages). Thick black and purple curves are 11 year running means, and dashed\nblack line shows the mean of the stacked MSA record over the 1901\u20131990 normalization interval.\nFigure 2. Correlation of the stacked Antarctic Peninsula MSA record with NCEP reanalysis July\u2013June\nannual averages of (a) surface air temperature, (b) mean sea level pressure, (c) 850 mbar zonal wind, and\n(d) 850 mbar meridional wind (1979\u20132004 [Kalnay et al., 1996]). Correlation fields show that increased\n(decreased) ice core MSA is associated with years of cool (warm) air temperature in the Bellingshausen\nSea that are caused by a high\u2010 (low\u2010) pressure anomaly in the Amundsen Sea that has accompanying\nsouthwesterly (northeasterly) wind anomalies that form along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula\nand extend across the Bellingshausen Sea.\nABRAM ET AL.: 20TH CENTURY ANTARCTIC SEA ICE DECLINE D23101D23101\n5 of 9\nAntarctic Peninsula and sea ice decline in the Bellingshausen\nSea [Lefebvre et al., 2004; Harangozo, 2006; Stammerjohn\net al., 2008; Goosse et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2009]. This\nis because strengthening of the Amundsen Sea Low brings\nwarm southerly wind anomalies to the western Antarctic\nPeninsula and Bellingshausen Sea region. To examine this\nlink further, we compared our ice core MSA time series with\nthe NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis record since 1979 of July\u2013June\nannual mean sea level pressure averaged over the region of\nthe Amundsen Sea spanning 100\u00b0W\u2013140\u00b0W and 55\u00b0S\u201370\u00b0S\n(Figure 3). A highly significant (r = 0.63, p = 0.01) rela-\ntionship exists between decreasing sea level pressure in this\nregion and decreasing MSA in the ice core records. Visual\nexamination of the records suggests that this relationship is\nrelevant both for the overall decreasing trends in Amundsen\nmean sea level pressure and Bellingshausen sea ice, as well\nas for interannual scale variability of these climate features\n(Figure 3). The inference that is gained from the MSA sea ice\nreconstruction is that the recent deepening of the Amundsen\nSea Low may also be part of a long\u2010term trend that has\noccurred over the whole of the 20th century.\n[19] The strength of the Amundsen Sea Low is known to\nbe influenced by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) that\ndescribes variability in the strength of the westerly winds\nthat circle the Antarctic continent [Marshall, 2003]. This is\ndue to the blocking effect of the mountainous Antarctic\nPeninsula that encourages the development of low\u2010pressure\nstorm system over the Amundsen Sea region when the cir-\ncumpolar westerlies are strong. A reconstruction of the\nSAM index back to 1958 based on station observations\nFigure 4. Regional sea ice reconstructions from (a) the Antarctic Peninsula stacked MSA record (this\nstudy), (b) the Law Dome ice core MSA record [Curran et al., 2003], and (c) the South Orkney his-\ntorical sea ice duration record [Murphy et al., 1995]. Left column plots for the calibration interval show\nthe ice core MSA and historical sea ice duration records (black curves) with the JIC sea ice extent (purple\ncurves) [Jacka, 1990] and NASA bootstrap sea ice extent (blue curves) [Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008]\ndata for the region where significant correlations exist between the proxy and satellite records. Estimates\nof past sea ice extent from the proxy records are based on calibration with the JIC sea ice extent data set,\nand r2 values for the calibration intervals are given. All are significant at greater than 99% confidence\nlevel. Right column plots show the 20th century regional sea ice reconstructions (thin black curves) with\ntheir 11 year running means (thick black curves). Corresponding regional sea ice extent data from the JIC\n(purple curves) and NASA bootstrap (blue curves) sources are also shown, and thick blue lines show the\n1979\u20132007 linear trends for the regional NASA sea ice extent data.\nABRAM ET AL.: 20TH CENTURY ANTARCTIC SEA ICE DECLINE D23101D23101\n6 of 9\nidentified a significant increase in the SAM that has been\nmost pronounced since the mid\u20101970s [Marshall, 2003].\nModel\u2010based assessments of the cause of the increase in the\nSAM index suggest that both the increase in greenhouse gas\nconcentrations and stratospheric ozone depletion have con-\ntributed to the increase in the SAM [Goosse et al., 2009],\nwith changes in stratospheric zone being likely the largest\ncontributor [Turner et al., 2009]. Our ice core record of\ndecreasing MSA (and Bellingshausen sea ice) shows a weak\ncorrelation with the strengthening of the annual average\nSAM index since 1957. The correlations that exist between\nJuly\u2013June annual mean warming at Faraday and the SAM\nindex are also below significance when calculated over the\nannual mean scale of the ice core record. This may be due to\nthe large seasonal differences in trends and variability of the\nSAM [Marshall, 2003]. The correlations of the Faraday\ntemperature and ice core MSA records with the SAM are\nobserved to be more robust after \u223c1980, which may also\nsuggest that the influence of the SAM on climate variability\nin this region has been enhanced in recent decades by the\ninfluence of stratospheric ozone depletion on circulation.\n4.2. Comparison With Other Records 20th Century\nSea Ice Change\n[20] To make a first\u2010order estimate of the amount of sea\nice decline that has occurred in the Bellingshausen Sea\nassociated with 20th century deepening of the Amundsen\nSea Low and warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, the stacked\nMSA record was calibrated to the JIC data for mean winter\nsea ice extent [Jacka, 1990] in the 70\u00b0W\u2013100\u00b0W region\nwhere a significant correlation occurs (Figure 4). This cali-\nbration was carried out over the 1973\u20131990 interval; defined\nby the start of the JIC data and the last year where our stacked\nMSA record is composed of data from at least two ice core\nsites. To extend the sea ice history as far as possible into the\npresent, the NASA bootstrap [Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008]\nwinter sea ice extent data (1979\u20132007) is also presented for\nthe 70\u00b0W\u2013100\u00b0W region. To allow for a direct comparison,\nthe gridded bootstrap sea ice extent data were first compiled\ninto the same 10\u00b0 longitude sectors as for the JIC data and\nwere then calibrated from a square kilometer scale onto the\nequivalent latitude South scale used for the JIC data. The\nexcellent agreement (r = 0.90) between the JIC and NASA\nbootstrap sea ice data sets is clearly evident in Figure 4.\n[21] Comparing the difference between mean MSA\u2010\nderived sea ice extent values from the 1900\u20131920 interval,\nwith those from the 1979\u20132007 NASA bootstrap satellite\nsea ice data, we estimate that the Bellingshausen Sea has\nexperienced a mean retreat in winter sea ice extent of \u223c0.7\u00b0\nsince the start of the 20th century. The significant trend of\ndecreasing MSA over the whole 1901\u20131990 interval equates\nto a winter sea ice decline of \u223c0.08\u00b0 \u00b1 0.02\u00b0 per decade and\nwhen maximized over the 1958\u20131990 interval to 0.26\u00b0 \u00b1\n0.14\u00b0 retreat per decade. For comparison, the linear trend in\nthe NASA sea ice data for 1979\u20132007 equates to a winter\nsea ice retreat of 0.18\u00b0 \u00b1 0.19\u00b0 per decade.\n[22] We applied this same calibration technique to two\nother records that previously have been used to infer Ant-\narctic sea ice changes during the 20th century (Figure 4).\nThe first is the coastal Law Dome ice core MSA record\n[Curran et al., 2003]. Repeating the correlation analysis\nwith winter sea ice extent we find a significant positive\ncorrelation in the 90\u00b0E\u2013110\u00b0E sector that lies offshore of\nLaw Dome. Using a geometric mean regression with sea ice\nextent, we suggest that this sector has experienced a mean\nsea ice retreat of \u223c1.2\u00b0 during the 20th century (1900\u20131920\nmean ice core proxy data compared with the 1979\u20132007\nmean NASA satellite sea ice data).\n[23] The other record used for comparison is the measure\nof winter sea ice duration at the South Orkney Islands that\nbegan in 1903 [Murphy et al., 1995]. This local sea ice\nduration index correlates significantly with winter sea ice\nextent across a broad region of the Weddell Sea between\n50\u00b0W and 10\u00b0E. Calibration of the sea ice duration index\nsuggests that during the 20th century the mean winter sea ice\nextent in the Weddell Sea has retreated by \u223c0.5\u00b0 (equivalent\nto a local decrease in sea ice duration of \u223c30 days at the\nSouth Orkney Islands; 1903\u20131920 mean historical data\ncompared with the 1979\u20132007 mean NASA satellite sea ice\ndata).\n[24] Each of the reconstructions show that winter sea ice\naround Antarctica has retreated during the 20th century. This\nlonger\u2010term perspective differs from observations based only\non the satellite era when Antarctic sea ice has undergone a\nsmall increase in extent [Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008].\nThis pattern of an overall 20th century decline in Antarctic sea\nice (despite the small increases during the satellite observa-\ntion era) is consistent with modelling studies performed over\nthe past half century that are forced by observed surface\ntemperature variations. These model simulations produce a\nclear decrease in Antarctic sea ice extent during the early\n1960s to the early 1980s most likely driven by increasing\ngreenhouse gas concentrations [Goosse et al., 2009], fol-\nlowed by a slight increase in sea ice area over the 1980\u20132000\nperiod due to regional\u2010scale sea ice changes driven by strato-\nspheric ozone depletion that have strengthened the Amundsen\nSea Low [Goosse et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2009].\n[25] The regional sea ice reconstructions from the Ant-\narctic Peninsula, Law Dome, and South Orkney sites indi-\ncate that the timing of 20th century sea ice decline has been\nmarkedly different between the three regions examined here\n(Figure 4). Our stacked MSA record for the Bellingshausen\nSea suggests that sea ice decreased progressively through\nthe 20th century, with the fastest retreat occurring since\n\u223c1958. Offshore of Law Dome, it appears that sea ice retreat\nbegan in \u223c1950, whereas the South Orkney index shows a\npronounced decline in sea ice extent in the Weddell Sea\nbetween \u223c1930\u20131960. These regional differences in 20th\ncentury sea ice decline around Antarctica suggest that\nmultiple regional reconstructions are needed to better\nunderstand the dynamics and drivers of past Antarctic sea\nice change, and the likely regional\u2010specific responses to\nongoing climate change.\n[26] It is useful to further compare these 20th century\nAntarctic sea ice reconstructions with sea ice change esti-\nmates derived from early ship charts and whale catch\npositions to gain a better understanding of the range of\ndifferent estimates for regional changes in Antarctic sea ice\nextent. Recently, a revised regional\u2010scale assessment has\nbeen carried out using direct and whaling\u2010based historical\nsea ice observations, where sea ice changes were determined\nfrom the differences between early (1930 to mid\u20101950s) to\nlate (1971\u20131987) sea ice position information [de la Mare,\n2009]. In the eastern Indian Ocean region (90\u00b0E\u2013170\u00b0E),\nABRAM ET AL.: 20TH CENTURY ANTARCTIC SEA ICE DECLINE D23101D23101\n7 of 9\nhistorical records suggest that a mean regional sea ice retreat\nof \u223c1.3\u00b0 occurred between the early and late intervals. Using\nthese same time intervals, a similar sea ice retreat of \u223c1.0\u00b0 in\nthe 90\u00b0E\u2013110\u00b0E sector is inferred from the Law Dome MSA\nrecord [Curran et al., 2003].\n[27] Historical whaling\/ship data are too sparse in the\nBellingshausen Sea to produce an estimate for this region\nalone, but across the broader South Pacific Ocean region\n(70\u2013150\u00b0W), sea ice retreat between the early and late\nintervals is estimated at \u223c0.3\u00b0 [de la Mare, 2009]. It is worth\nnoting, however, that in this region, different historical\nsources give very different sea ice change estimates; direct\nship observations indicate an early\u2010to\u2010late sea ice retreat of\n\u223c2.1\u00b0, whereas whale catch records suggest an early\u2010to\u2010late\nsea ice advance of \u223c0.6\u00b0. Our MSA\u2010based reconstruction for\nthe 70\u00b0W\u2013100\u00b0W sector of the Bellingshausen Sea docu-\nments no mean change (0.0\u00b0) in sea ice extent between these\nspecific early and late intervals. This is due to the timing of\nthe early and late intervals with respect to decadal variability\nin the Bellingshausen sea ice reconstruction.\n[28] In the Weddell Sea region, significantly different\nmagnitudes of sea ice retreat are produced using the whaling\/\nship chart information compared with the inferences from\nthe sea ice duration record from the South Orkney Islands.\nThe South Orkney record [Murphy et al., 1995] suggests a\nmean sea ice retreat in the Weddell Sea region of \u223c0.4\u00b0\nbetween the early and late intervals, whereas whaling\/ship\nrecords from this region suggest that sea ice retreat may\nhave exceeded 4\u00b0 [de la Mare, 2009]. This exceptionally\nlarge sea ice retreat indicated by the historical ship\u2010based\nrecords has been hypothesized to reflect, at least in part, the\ndynamic position of the eastern tongue of the Weddell Sea\nice pack that in some years delayed or prevented the early\nwhaling vessels from reaching the true sea ice edge [de la\nMare, 2009]. It is also possible that a more prominent and\nsustained Weddell ice tongue during the early 20th century\nresulted in a strong seasonal difference in sea ice retreat in\nthis region, with the whaling records documenting a strong\nretreat of the summer ice pack, and the South Orkney sea ice\nduration record representing a more moderate retreat of\nwinter sea ice.\n5. Implications\n[29] Our study using ice cores from three sites along the\nwestern and northern Antarctic Peninsula has found that in\nthis region the MSA concentration in ice is a reliable proxy\nfor regional\u2010scale changes in winter sea ice extent. The ice\ncore MSA\u2010based reconstruction indicates that the Belling-\nshausen Sea has experienced a progressive decline in sea ice\nthroughout the 20th century, with a particularly strong\nretreat in sea ice since \u223c1958. This supports theories that\nrecent warming along the Antarctic Peninsula has been part\nof a continued trend since the early 1900s. Climate simu-\nlation studies may be able to further test the relationship that\nthese 20th century changes in Bellingshausen sea ice and\nAntarctic Peninsula temperatures have to circulation pro-\ncesses associated with the Amundsen Sea Low and the\nSAM, and the implications that greenhouse gas concentra-\ntions and stratospheric ozone changes have for future\nchanges in Antarctic sea ice extent. The recent collection of\na deep ice core from James Ross Island will also allow for a\nmore complete understanding of the natural range and dri-\nvers of past sea ice variability in the Bellingshausen Sea\nspanning the whole of the Holocene.\n[30] The sea ice reconstruction, presented here, for the\nBellingshausen Sea builds on previous evidence for a 20th\ncentury decline in Antarctic sea ice. Although all presatellite\nrecords demonstrate evidence for a decline in Antarctic sea\nice during the 20th century, the details of these reconstructed\nsea ice declines are quite varied. Differences in the magni-\ntude of sea ice decline that is reconstructed by different\nmethods within the same region highlight the need for\nimproved methods of quantification for the historical and\nproxy record data sets. Geographical differences in the\ntiming of sea ice decline demonstrate the need for multiple\nregional\u2010scale reconstructions. For the future, ice core MSA\nrecords from the Amundsen Sea coast and around coastal\neast Antarctica will be particularly useful for developing a\nmore comprehensive understanding of the geographical\ndifferences in interannual to centennial\u2010scale changes in\nAntarctic sea ice. The combination of ice core MSA records\nwith numerical modeling assessments of MSA production,\ntransport, and deposition pathways will also help to improve\nthe quantification of these sea ice reconstructions so that the\ndrivers of past and future sea ice change around Antarctica\nmay be better understood.\n[31] Acknowledgments.
