The technique can be used to attach substituents bearing both acid and amine \nfunctional groups, making the materials suitable for further modification. Acid\/amine \nfunctionalisation is achieved by a simple reflux reaction and therefore is a quick and easily \nscalable process. The modified nanofibres maintain their ability to switch between different \nstates displaying distinctly different properties, thus making them suitable for adaptive \nsensing applications. As an example, we demonstrate how biomolecules can be attached to \nthese functionalised nanofibres, to produce conducting polymer-based biosensors. \n  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nPolyaniline (PAni) is an example of a stable conducting polymer whose properties \n(optical, electrical and electrochemical) change in response to the immediate molecular \nenvironment of the material. PAni can be cheaply and conveniently synthesized and, thus, has \nhuge potential in sensor applications. PAni nanofibres can be synthesised directly by \nchemical means. The technique used here is known as interfacial polymerisation and it is a \nscalable technique whereby increasing the amount of reactants results in a greater yield of \nnanofibre product. By using PAni nanofibres (versus bulk) the surface area exposed to the \ntarget molecules can be dramatically increased, resulting in a sensor material with enhanced \nsensitivity and improved response times 1-5. Our focus is on the covalent modification of \nthese structures post-polymerisation, while simultaneously maintaining the intrinsic nano-\nmorphology of the polymer material6. Using the technique described, control over the extent \nof functionalisation can be achieved 7. Functionalised PAni nanofibres can then be used as \ntemplates for further modification with target specific receptor sites, thus improving \nselectivity. Here we demonstrate the subsequent attachment of antibody based bioreceptors, \nwhereby resulting PAni-antibody conjugates have applications in the field of electrochemical \nimmunosensors.  \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \nNanofibre Synthesis \n Polyaniline nanofibres were synthesised by interfacial polymerisation between an \naqueous and an organic layer, as reported previously1. The product was purified by \ncentrifugation (4000 rpm\/5 min\/3 cycles) and suspended as a colloid in deionised water. \nFibres were then modified with either acid- or amine-terminated thiols (HS(CH2)3COOH or \nHS(CH2)2NH2), by refluxing at 100 \u00b0C for 2 hours in an aqueous buffer at pH 48. All \nexperiments were carried out under identical conditions using 45 mg PAni. The product was \npurified by centrifugation (4000 rpm\/5 min\/3 cycles) and re-suspended as a colloid in \ndeionised water.  \n \nAntibody immobilisation \nAntibodies were subsequently covalently immobilised by the addition of mouse IgG (100 \u00b5l, \n0.1 mg\/ml) and ethyl diaminocarbodiimide (4 mg), to a dispersion of PAni nanofibres (1ml, \n0.2 mg\/ml). The dispersion was left shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The PAni-IgG \nconjugate was centrifuged and washed in distilled water 3 times. Any remaining un-reacted \nsites on the nanofibres were blocked with 5 wt. % milk marvel overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The PAni-\nIgG conjugate was then centrifuged (10 min at 4000 rpm) and washed 3 times with distilled \nwater. Anti-mouse IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) was diluted 1 in 1000 in 1 \n% (w\/v) milk marvel\/PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) to give a final concentration of 0.6 \u00b5g\/ml and 1 ml \nof this solution was added to the PAni-IgG pellet, re-dispersed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for one \nhour. The PAni mixture was then centrifuged (10 min at 4000 rpm) and washed a further 3 \ntimes with water and the PAni pellet re-suspended in 0.5 ml water.  \n \nCharacterisation \nModified nanofibres were coated with 10 nm Au\/Pd and imaged using field emission \nscanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV on a S-4300 \nHitachi system. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the switching of modified PAni \nbetween different redox states. It was carried out on a Perkin Elmer UV-vis NIR Lambda 900 \nSpectrometer at 1 nm resolution. Cyclic voltammetry was used to confirm HRP labelled \nsecondary-antibody attachment to the modified Pani nanofibres. It was performed using an \neDAQ e-corder (401) and potentiostat\/galvanostat (EA 160) with Chart v5.1.2\/EChem v 2.0.2 \nsoftware (ADInstruments), and a PC computer, in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS - \n0.1 M, pH 7.4) with Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and platinum mesh counter electrode. \n \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \n Interfacial polymerisation resulted in the formation of polyaniline nanofibres. These \nnanofibres could be purified by a simple centrifugation technique and subsequently \nsuspended in a solvent of choice. Nanofibres could be modified by a simple reflux process to \nattach thiol terminated carboxylic acid or amine side-chains. The covalent attachment was \nverified using FTIR and NMR as previously published by the authors7. Post-modification, \nnanofibres maintain their nanostructure (Figure 1), and hence high surface area. They can be \ncast as films onto a variety of substrates, or used in solution. \n \n \n    \nFigure 1: SEM imaging confirms that PAni is nanostructured post-functionalisation. The \nimage on the left is magnified x500 and the one on the right is x100. \n \nPolyaniline nanofibres are of interest for sensing applications as they can adapt and respond \nin an intelligent manner to their immediate surroundings. As they respond, the chemical \nstructure of the material is altered and this is reflected as a change in the optical properties \u2013 \nsuch as colour. Post-functionalisation, nanofibres maintain this ability to switch states hence \nmaking them suitable for sensing applications. Like PAni, the colour of the functionalised \nfibres is sensitive to the environment of the material (Figure 2). This colour change can be \ndetected using UV-vis spectroscopy. \n300 400 500 600 700 800\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nAb\nso\nrb\na\nn\nce\n \n(au\n)\nwavelength (nm)\nPA-COOH \n pH1\n pH9\n \nFigure 2: The optical properties of carboxylic acid modified nanofibres (PAni-COOH) \nchange in response to the pH of their immediate chemical environment. The colour of a \nPAni-COOH dispersion changes from purple to green as the pH decreases (this is the same as \nthe colour change observed for unmodified PAni). The UV-vis spectrum of the material also \nchanges accordingly. \n \nCovalent attachment of biomolecules \nOne of the major limitations for commercial application of PAni sensors is a lack of \nselectivity. By functionalizing PAni, we create a platform that can be further modified to \nattach more sophisticated molecules, such as biomolecules9. Thus providing a simple method \nfor improving selectivity of the material. Both amine and acid side-chains can be used as \nanchor sites to attach other molecules. Here we show how antibodies can be covalently \nattached to these functionalised nanofibres. Initial studies were performed using mouse IgG. \nPost-modification the nanofibre surface morphology changes due to the covalent antibody \nattachment (Figure 3). However, the material maintains a high surface area (as seen in SEM), \nwhich is significant for sensing applications as it enables a greater number of reaction sites to \nbe accessed. The electrochemical surface area of the material may be calculated from the \ncharge density obtained from cyclic voltammetry. No significant decrease in the \nelectrochemical surface area is observed for nanofibres pre and post-modification with \nbiomolecules (not shown). Covalently bound antibodies could be used to detect the presence \nof secondary antibodies (a-IgG). This was demonstrated electrochemically by using HRP-\nlabeled secondary antibodies. The iron redox couple (A and A\u2019) of the HRP can be clearly \nseen in cyclic voltammetry scans at 0.2V (this is absent for the PAni nanofibres without \nantibodies attached). \n \n  \nA\nA\u2019\n-1.2E-06\n-6.0E-07\n0.0E+00\n6.0E-07\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1\nPotential vs Ag\/AgCl (V)\nCu\nrr\nen\nt (\nA)\nPAni + Ab\nCu\nrr\nen\nt (\nA)\n \n \nFigure 3: FESEM (left) shows that the nanostructure is maintained after antibody attachment.  \nAn iron redox couple (A and A\u2019) centered at 0.2V confirms the presence of secondary \nantibodies. This peak is absent for the PAni control experiment. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \n \nThis study shows the successful functionalization of PAni nanofibres. By focusing on \nthe modification of nanofibre surfaces post-polymerisation, the intrinsic properties (such as \ndoping) of the PAni backbone can be maintained. Modified PAni nanofibres provide a \nscaffold which can be further modified with selective moieties for the detection of target \nspecies, such as biomolecules. Using the process described, we can combine the advantages \nof a functionalized organic conductor and a low dimensional nanostructure.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS   \n \nThe authors acknowledge funding from Science Foundation Ireland under SFI 07\/CE\/I1147 - \n\"CLARITY: Centre for Sensor Web Technologies\", and also Enterprise Ireland under \nPC\/2008\/0149.
