INTRODUCTION\nAmorphous carbon and hydrogenated amorphous carbon\nfilms ~a-C and a-C:H! have received much scientific interest\nsince the early 1970s due to their useful mechanical\nproperties.1\u20135 Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive tech-\nnique which is used to characterize diamondlike carbon\n~DLC! or polymerlike carbon films. Tamor and Vassel6\nfound Raman \u2018\u2018fingerprinting\u2019\u2019 to reliably predict hydroge-\nnation, optical gap, and other mechanical properties. Yet,\nthere have been no publications that can theoretically or ana-\nlytically explain the observed Raman effects in a-C and\na-C:H thin films.\nTuinstra and Koenig7 obtained Raman spectra of single-\ncrystal and microcrystalline graphite samples in 1970. For\nsingle-crystal graphite they found a single line at 1575 cm21\nwhich was attributed to the Raman active E2g2 mode of\ngraphite ~additionally there exists an interplanar \u2018\u2018rigid-layer\nshear\u2019\u2019 mode E2g1 at 42 cm\n21!.8,9 The E2g2 mode is com-\nmonly referred to as the G peak ~G for graphite!. For micro-\ncrystalline graphite, Tuinstra and Koenig found two lines\ncentered at 1575 and 1355 cm21. Tuinstra and Koenig as-\nsigned the 1355 cm21 line to first-order scattering from a\nzone boundary phonon activated by disorder due to the finite\ncrystallite size. Nemanich and Solin8 explained the 1355\ncm21 peak by the flatness of the phonon dispersion curves at\nthe zone boundary ~from K to M point!. Thus, a high phonon\ndensity of states will be created, which results in peaks at\n1340 cm21 and a peak at 1470 cm21. In literature the 1355\ncm21 mode is referred to as the D peak ~D for disordered!.\nThe experiments of Tuinstra and Koenig7 were sup-\nported by calculations of Lespade, Al-Jishi, and\nDresselhaus10 who made computations for Raman scattering\nfrom incompletely graphitized carbons and amorphous car-\nbons. Lespade, Al-Jishi, and Dresselhaus10 also found that\nthe Raman features were strongly correlated to the mean dia-\nmagnetic susceptibility, which itself is sensitive to the size of440 J. Appl. Phys. 80 (1), 1 July 1996 0021-8979\/9\nded\u00ac20\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.118.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAordered two-dimensional regions in the graphitic layers.\nWada and Solin11 showed that the E2g2 mode of graphite has\na 50 times higher Raman scattering cross section than the\n\u2018\u2018diamond band\u2019\u2019 at 1332 cm21. Using the results of Wada\nand Solin11 Nemanich et al.12 discussed Raman scattering of\nDLC thin films based on a carbon composite model. They\nconcluded that the Raman scattering of DLC is similar to\nmicrocrystalline graphite from their measurements. Shroder,\nNemanich, and Glass13 showed that the size of such \u2018\u2018gra-\nphitic\u2019\u2019 regions should be islands less than 15\u201320 \u00c5. They\nshowed that the Raman scattering in the DLC films associ-\nated with sp2 bonding is much stronger than for crystalline\nor microcrystalline graphite.\nWada, Gaczi, and Solin14 in a study of a-C films using\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy ~EELS!, electron spin\n~paramagnetic! resonance ~ESR or EPR!, and Raman spec-\ntroscopy showed their films to have planar graphitic clusters\nof 20 \u00c5 size. Beeman et al.15 stated that the model of Wada,\nGaczi, and Solin14 could be improved by incorporating four-\nfold coordinated carbon in the cluster matrix which allows\nchanges in the orientation of the graphitic planes. They\nshowed the strong influence of bond angle disorder on the\nphonon density of states and Raman intensity. Robertson and\nO\u2019Reilly16 stated that the sp2 graphitic clusters should be\nterminated by sp3 sites. Dillon, Wodam, and Katkanant17\nproposed that the Raman line positions yield further infor-\nmation concerning the bond angle disorder and the bonding\nin crystallites. They also attributed the observed decrease in\nlinewidth for the D and G peaks of the a-C films to the\nremoval of bond angle disorder and the increasing domi-\nnance of crystallites.\nLi and Lannin18 found in-plane correlation lengths of\n15\u201330 \u00c5 in nanocrystalline \u2018\u2018glassy\u2019\u2019 carbon and demon-\nstrated that the Raman spectra represents a weighted phonon6\/80(1)\/440\/8\/$10.00 \u00a9 1996 American Institute of Physics\nIP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloaddensity of states ~phonon DOS! of low frequency order by\ncomparison with inelastic neutron scattering data. Raman\nscattering proved to be most useful in the characterization of\ncarbon films when the G peak and D peak are distinct in the\nspectrum. If the carbon system is highly disordered, strong\ncontributions to the G and D peak from the phonon DOS\nmakes analysis more complicated and demanding.\nWe report that the observed Raman results of amorphous\n~hydrogenated! carbon films may be interpreted in terms of\nan amorphous carbon matrix of threefold and fourfold coor-\ndinated carbon atoms in which small regions of a few con-\ndensed benzene rings ~after Ehrhardt et al.19 and Kleber\net al.20 up to five fused benzene rings! are embedded. In this\narticle, it is shown that the so-called D peak is present in\ncondensed benzene regions even as small as one benzene\nring. Thus the nomenclature \u2018\u2018disordered\u2019\u2019 peak is not mean-\ningful for a-C:~H! films. The existence of the D peak is\nconsidered to be evidence for benzene or condensed benzene\nrings in amorphous ~hydrogenated! carbon films. We also\nshow that the G peak is not necessarily composed only of the\nE2g2 mode of graphite but also of sp\n2 C5C stretch vibra-\ntions.\nA possible explanation for the position of the G peak\nand its width will be discussed. The article also tries to un-\nderline the importance of the ID\/IG intensity ratio and the G\nlinewidth. Only by taking both the ID\/IG intensity ratio and\nthe G linewidth can an estimate of the benzene cluster sizes\nin carbon films be obtained.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe films studied in this article were prepared by a mag-\nnetron and a magnetically field enhanced plasma deposition\nsystem ~MEPD!. The films prepared in the unbalanced mag-\nnetron source were amorphous carbon films ~with hydrogen\nincorporation lower than 2 at. % as determined by 15N\nnuclear resonance method! and were deposited by sputtering\nof a graphite target in an Ar atmosphere at a pressure of\n1.531023 mbar at temperatures below 50 \u00b0C. For two differ-\nent argon ion\/neutral carbon ratios of five and ten, carbon\nfilms were deposited at different argon ion energies on crys-\ntalline silicon substrates. The films reveal densities up to 3.1\ng\/cm3 and sp3 ratios of up to 87% as determined by EELS\nmeasurements.21 Carbon films with such a high sp3 ratio are\noften referred to as highly tetrahedral amorphous carbon\nfilms ~ta-C!. The deposition mechanism and other physical\nproperties are explained in more detail elsewhere.21\nThe films prepared by a MEPD were performed by an\ninductively coupled 13.56 MHz acetylene discharge at dif-\nferent pressures ranging from 731024 up to 231023 mbar.\nThe a-C:H films were deposited onto a water-cooled\ngrounded substrate holder. These films contain about 29\u201332\nat. % hydrogen depending on the pressure of the discharge.\nThe applied magnetic field was 500 G at the substrate surface\nas determined by Hall probe measurements. More details\nabout the films and the deposition system are found\nelsewhere.22\nThe Raman measurements were carried out on a Raman\napparatus using the 515 nm line of an Ar ion laser focused toJ. Appl. Phys., Vol. 80, No. 1, 1 July 1996\ned\u00ac20\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.118.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIP2 mm2. The laser power was 500 mW and the spectral reso-\nlution of the apparatus was 8 cm21. Typical data acquisition\ntimes were in the range of 25 min. The spectra were recorded\nin the range of 80\u20133000 cm21 in order to allow reliable\nfitting ~Table I!. In the case of the MEPD deposited a-C:H\nfilms the Raman spectra have been fitted by two Gaussians\nallowing all the fit parameters to vary. In the case of films\ndeposited by magnetron sputtering combined with ion plat-\ning ~MS\/IP! most of the films could not be fitted by two\nGaussians ~except those deposited at low Ar plating energy!.\nTo obtain a good fit it was necessary to use four Gaussians\n~Table II!. Here all the fit parameters such as linewidths,\npositions, and areas were allowed to vary @Fig. 1~b!#. Other\nRaman data has been taken from the literature. Figure 1~b!\nshows Raman features which are due to a highly disordered\ncarbon structure.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTuinstra and Koenig7 found that the Raman intensity of\nthe ID\/IG is inversely proportional to the graphite crystallize\nsize La :\n1\nLa\n}\nI1355\nI1575\n5\nID\nIG\n, ~1!\nwhere La is the graphite crystallite size as determined by x\nray. Equation ~1!, although valid for graphite, has so far not\nbeen proven to be valid for amorphous carbon and hydroge-\nnated amorphous carbon films. Tamor et al.30 showed by\ncomparison with optical measurements that Eq. ~1! cannot be\napplied to amorphous carbon. Therefore the analogy of\namorphous carbon to graphite is not straightforward. Knight\nand White28 presented data which when extrapolated showed\nan ID\/IG ratio of four for a graphitic cluster size of 10 \u00c5.\nThus, the experiment places an upper limit of 10\u201320 \u00c5 for\nTABLE I. Before fitting of the carbon films prepared by magnetron sput-\ntering the background of the Raman spectrum has to be subtracted. There-\nfore four Gaussians centered at the given wavelengths had to be subtracted.\nThe original Raman spectrum of one film can be seen in Fig. 1~a! together\nwith the background spectrum.

Such\nsmall cluster sizes evoke the question of the origin of the D\nand G peak in amorphous carbons.\nA. G peak and D peak in amorphous (hydrogenated)\ncarbon films\nConsider the G peak. Single benzene rings exhibit a Ra-\nman peak at 1588 cm21 @Fig. 2~a!#. This feature is valid for\nbenzene, all aromatic rings, and condensed benzene rings. A\npossible contribution to the G peak therefore may arise from\nthe C5C sp2 stretch vibrations of olefinic or conjugated car-\nbon \u2018\u2018chains\u2019\u2019 ~or first-order scattering from features in the\ndensity of states of a graphite network! at about 1620 cm21,\ntoo. Thus, the existence of a G peak in the Raman spectrum\ndoes not necessarily prove that the a-C film consists only of\ngraphite or fused benzene rings. The G peak might as well\nhave its origin in olefinic chains in the carbon film. Benzene\nrings show a further Raman feature at 1486 cm21 @Fig.\n2~b!#.29 A peak centered at 1490 cm21 can be attributed to\nsemicircle stretching of carbon atoms in single aromatic\nrings or fused aromatic rings.29,31 Another possible explana-\ntion for the peak at 1470 cm21 ~in finite-size crystals of\ngraphite! was given by Nemanich and Solin,8 who attributed\nthis peak to contributions from the phonon DOS.\nIn the case of the D peak, interaction force constant\neffects have to be considered.29 Normally, the simple valence\nforce field is used to calculate vibration frequencies. If two\nor more oscillators in a molecule or solid are distorted from\nequilibrium, they may be able to affect each other\u2019s restoring\nforces to some extent, due to changes in the electronic struc-\nture. A more general valence force field considers the total\nrestoring force on one oscillator to be equal to a force con-\nstant times its own distortion plus a second force constant\nTABLE II.

The second force\nconstant is called the interaction force constant and can be\neither positive or negative. The alternating ring stretch of\nbenzene is illustrated in Fig. 2~c!. During this vibration, the\nelectronic structure changes and approaches the Kekule ben-\nzene structure where electrons partially slip away from\nstretched bonds into contracted bonds. This leads to the fre-\nquency of the alternating ring stretch vibration of benzene to\n1311 cm21, much lower than that predicted from the simple\nvalence force field model ~1700 cm21!. For a more detailed\ndiscussion see Colthup et al.29 The existence of a peak cen-\ntered at about 1350 cm21 proves the existence of aromatic or\nbenzene clusters incorporated in the amorphous ~hydroge-\nnated! carbon films. Nevertheless, if a Raman spectrum of a\ncarbon film reveals a peak at 1350 cm21 this peak may as\nwell have its origin in the phonon DOS contribution of\nhighly disordered graphitic structures8 ~see also Table II!.\nThe Raman spectrum of the molecule 1,2,3,4-tetra-\nphenylnaphthalene32 is shown in Fig. 3. Similar Raman spec-\ntra of molecules such as 1,4-diphenylbutadiene, 2,6-\ndimethylnaphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene,\nnaphthalene,32,33 etc., all exhibit typical Raman features at\nabout 1600, 1490, and 1350 cm21. In addition to these mol-\necules containing a large amount of hydrogen, compared to\na-C:H, the spectra prove that even small aromatic cluster\nsizes can account for the Raman features normally observed\nin amorphous carbon and hydrogenated amorphous carbon.\nB. Line broadening effects in amorphous carbon\nIn principle there may be four significant reasons for line\nbroadening of the G line feature in a-C:H films; namely the\ncluster size, the cluster distribution, the influence of the\nstress in the films, and broadening due to chemical bonding.\nNemanich et al.12 and Shroder, Nemanich, and Glass13\nfound that the relative concentration and crystallite size are\ncrucially important in the analysis of Raman spectra. They\nalso showed that the vibrational modes of small crystallites\nFIG. 3. Raman spectrum 1,2,3,4-tetraphenylnaphthalene after Ref. 32.\nStrong Raman scattering is observed at 1380 cm21. This feature is stronger\nthan the 1600 cm21 stretch vibrations of the sp2 modes. This molecule\nexhibits a significant \u2018\u2018ID\/IG ratio.\u2019\u2019J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 80, No. 1, 1 July 1996\ned\u00ac20\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.118.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIPcan be described as phonons with an uncertainty in the wave\nvector ~Dk}2p\/d , where d is the domain size!.\nTherefore, it is possible that the cluster size may also\ninfluence the linewidth of the G feature. Nemanich et al.12\nand Schroder, Nemanich, and Glass13 also discussed the ab-\nsorption depths and phonon decay lengths for the constituent\nmaterial as being larger than the domain size and as a result\nthe Raman spectra will be a superposition if the phonons are\nconfined to different regions. This is considered to be the\ncase in a-C and a-C:H due to the existence of various num-\nbers of clusters of different sizes and different environments.\nThus a superposition of the different Raman modes will oc-\ncur @shown schematically in Fig. 2~d!# and broader lin-\newidths are expected. The influence of the stress on the G\nlinewidth of the a-C and a-C:H films is shown in Fig. 4. This\nfigure reveals that stress cannot be ruled out as a line broad-\nening factor since this also is a measure of strain in the\nsurroundings of the benzene clusters and sp2 bonding. For\ngraphite, Sakata et al.34 found that the half-width of the 1580\ncm21 peak increases linearly with increasing stress. Similar\nto the findings of Sakata et al.34 we too find a linear depen-\ndence of the G linewidth with stress, with the linewidth\nfound for the a-C and a-C:H films being much broader than\nthose of graphite. From Fig. 4 it may be deduced that the\nlatter (a-C:H films! traces a different slope in comparison to\nthe data for amorphous carbon films. If comparisons were\nmade to the variation of stress in graphite,34 it would indicate\nthat the hydrogen causes changes in the elastic constants in\namorphous carbon films.\nThus, all four effects ~size, distribution, stress, chemical\nenvironment! may contribute to the broadening of the G line-\nwidth. In principle these reasons may also be true for the\nlinewidth of the D line.\nC. ID\/IG ratio in amorphous carbon\nExamining the Raman spectrum of the simple symmetric\n1,2,3,4-tetraphenylnaphthalene ~Fig. 3! it can be seen that\nthere is a more intense D peak feature compared to the G\npeak feature although the benzene clusters are small. There\nexist a lot of border regions of the benzene clusters which are\nresponsible for the D peak feature. It is now possible to\ndiscuss the observed maximum of the ID\/IG ratio as a func-\nFIG. 4.

Tuinstra and Koenig7 did not find a D peak in ideal\ngraphite. If this ideal graphite is now assumed to be more\nand more disturbed by sp3 bonded carbon, the D peak will\ndevelop and rise in magnitude in the Raman spectrum. When\nthe material is composed entirely of sp3 bonded carbon\n~and\/or olefinic chains connected by sp3 bonded carbon! the\nD peak should not be detected in this model because there\nexist no benzene clusters that gave rise to the disordered\nregions which are responsible for the D peak, i.e., in a com-\npletely sp3 network the ID\/IG ratio will tend to zero. This is\nobserved by Prawer et al.37 in ta-C films prepared by mass\nselected ion beams having sp3 ratios of about 80%. Accord-\ning to the model proposed the ID\/IG ratio will go through a\nmaximum which is dependent on the cluster sizes and distri-\nbutions. Using the extrapolation of Knight and White28 and\nusing the experimental results that a maximum to the ratio of\nfour was found, the optimum cluster size for a maximum\nID\/IG ratio is estimated to be 10 \u00c5. But still the ID\/IG ratio\nis generally a measure for the zone edges or border\nphonons38 of the clusters ~which depend on cluster sizes and\ndistributions!.\nTamor et al.30 concluded from their measurements that\nthe ID\/IG ratio is not a useful indicator of graphitic clusters\nin amorphous carbon films. The Raman results so far confirm\nthe cluster model of Wada, Gaczi, and Solin14 and Robertson\nand O\u2019Reilly.16 But Raman spectroscopy does not necessar-\nily prove the existence of large cluster sizes that are dis-\ncussed in these models. Ehrhardt et al.19 and Kleber et al.20\nfound cluster sizes of up to 5 fused benzene rings in their\na-C:H films as derived from ESR.\nSince the G linewidth is partly determined by the do-\nmain or size of the ~fused! benzene rings, the ID\/IG ratio is\nplotted versus G linewidth in Fig. 5 for various a-C and\nFIG. 5.

We propose that the D peak for carbon\nfilms with a G linewidth smaller than 45 cm21 is dominated by microcrys-\ntalline graphite inclusions whereas the D peak for a-C~:H! films with G\nlinewidths broader than 45 cm21 is mostly dominated by small aromatic\nclusters with cluster sizes lower than 10 \u00c5.444 J.

All named authors used the 5145 \u00c5\nexcitation line, so that their results can be compared. Here\nthe difference between graphite, microcrystalline graphite,\nchemical vapor deposited a-C:H, sputtered a-C, ta-C ~tetra-\nhedrally bonded amorphous carbon! deposited by laser abla-\ntion, and MEPD deposited a-C:H films can be clearly seen.\nThe line through these points is for leading the eye. The\ncarbon films deposited by MS\/IP will be discussed later. In\nthe case of microcrystalline graphite the small linewidth and\nlow ID\/IG ratio are good indicators for the crystallinity of the\nsamples. As the G linewidth gets broader there is a maxi-\nmum in the ID\/IG ratio of four. In order to get a better survey\nthe graphitic cluster sizes, those from Tuinstra and Koenig7\nand Knight and White28 are also included on the ID\/IG axis\nand the bottom line of the G-linewidth axis.\nWhen the G linewidth for amorphous carbon films and\namorphous hydrogenated carbon films increases above a\nvalue of 50 cm21 it is observed ~Fig. 5! that the ID\/IG ratio\ndecreases. As discussed previously @see Eq. ~1!#, if the G\nlinewidth increases beyond 50 cm21, it results in a reduction\nin the ID\/IG ratio. From the work of Tuinstra and Koenig7\nwe see that the maximum in the ID\/IG peak value of 4 cor-\nresponds to an effective graphitic cluster size for carbon\nfilms of 10 \u00c5. Therefore, when the G linewidth increases\nbeyond 50 cm21, the resulting decrease in the ID\/IG ratio\nwould be indicative of a cluster size smaller than 10 \u00c5 ac-\ncording to Eq. ~1!. This result is confirmed by the extrapo-\nlated values for microcrystalline graphite by Knight and\nWhite.28 The data points in Fig. 5 lead to the conclusion that\nthe fused benzene clusters in a-C:H deposited by chemical\nvapor deposition are larger than in sputtered a-C. Recent\ntransmission electron microscope results by Davis et al.40 on\na-C:H superlattice structures show there to be no evidence of\nclusters greater than 5 \u00c5 in rf plasma deposited a-C:H films.\nThe Raman data for amorphous sputtered carbon reveal that\nonly a minor fraction of ordered sixfold rings exists.41 If\nthere were larger clusters inside the sputtered carbon films\nthe G linewidth should be smaller and the ID\/IG ratio should\nbe higher. In the case of ion-carbon ~i-C! or highly tetrahe-\ndral amorphous carbon ~ta-C! the ID\/IG ratio together with\nthe G linewidth indicates the presence of little benzene ~clus-\nter! inclusions within the films. The a-C:H films deposited\nby the MEPD also possess low ID\/IG ratio and broad G\nlinewidth.22,37 This is also an indication for small clusters in\nthe films. The optical gap of these films is quite high ~2 eV!\nwhich also reinforces the interpretation of cluster sizes as\nderived from the ID\/IG ratio and G linewidth.\nThe ta-C films deposited by the unbalanced magnetron\ndeviate from the data of the other carbon films. In the authors\nopinion the high stress in the films ~up to 20 GPa measured\nby the bending beam method using Stoney\u2019s equation! is\nresponsible for the broad G linewidth. In these films the\nID\/IG ratio alone indicates an effective cluster size of about\n10 \u00c5. Thus, only the knowledge about both the ID\/IG ratio\nand the G linewidth allows a rough estimate of the cluster\nsize in amorphous ~hydrogenated! carbon films.

Positions of the G and D peak of amorphous\n(hydrogenated) carbon films\nThe position of the G peak is more complicated. The\ndependence of the G position on H content for some a-C:H\nfilms is shown in Fig. 6. This figure reveals that the G posi-\ntion depends on the local environment of the benzene clus-\nters and sp2 bonding. Ager et al.42 further found a strong\ndependence of the G position on stress in ta-C films depos-\nited by filtered cathodic vacuum arc. They showed that by\ndelaminating the highly stressed ta-C films from crystalline\nsilicon ~allowing the films to relax! the G position may drop\nby about 20 cm21.\nAnother possible feature which might influence the G\nline position is the peak at 1486 cm21 which has already\nbeen attributed to semicircle stretch vibrations in benzene or\nbenzene clusters. Wagner et al.38 and Ramsteiner et al.43\nfound an interference-enhanced Raman scattering in hard\namorphous carbon films, while the position of the G peak\nand the intensity ratio ID\/IG of the D and G peaks depended\non the incident photon energy. They explained this by a two-\nphase model in which the Raman spectrum is a superposition\nof two distinct vibronic Raman spectra. They attributed\nphase 1 ~revealing a Raman peak between 1300 and 1500\ncm21! to a sp2 network including sp3 bonds and phase 2\n~revealing a Raman peak at about 1600 cm21! to sp2 clus-\nters. They assumed that as the photon energy changes both\nphases have distinct contributions to the overall Raman scat-\ntering thus changing the G position and ID\/IG intensity ratio.\nThis model has to be extended in a similar manner such that\na-C:H or a-C is not a two-phase system but an n-phase\nsystem, because the absorption depths and phonon decay\nlengths for the constituent material are expected to be larger\nthan the domain size ~optical skin depth in graphite amounts\nto 600 \u00c5 for light scattering at 488 nm!34 of the condensed\nbenzene rings.12,13 The feature at about 1580 cm21, as well\nas the feature at 1486 cm21 ~their possible origins are listed\nFIG. 6.

Figure 8\nshows that in principle the same arguments that hold for the\nG position may also hold for the D position. It illustrates that\nfor example stress in the films shifts the G position as well as\nthe D position. Figure 8 also reveals that there is a strong\ncorrelation between the G position and D position on the\ntype of the films which was already shown by Tamor et al.6\nE. Raman feature at 1180 cm21 for carbon films\ndeposited by the magnetron\nIn the films deposited by the MS\/IP technique we were\nnot able to obtain good fits just by considering the G and D\npeaks. Acceptable fits could only be reached by adding two\nextra peaks at approximately 1180 and 1490 cm21. The peak\nat 1490 cm21 has already been discussed. Together with the\n1180 cm21 peak a rather small and narrow peak at 1305\ncm21 is observed for films with high sp3 content. The peak\nat 1180 cm21 is very broad with a bandwidth of 200 cm21.\nOne of the components that causes such a broadening is the\nhigh compressive stress present in the films.\nA peak at 1140 cm21 was attributed to nanocrystalline\ndiamond by Yarbrough et al.25 Silva et al.26 assigned a peak\nat 1170 cm21 to hexagonal diamond based on glancing angle\nx-ray and Raman results. Nemanich et al.12 stated that this\npeak could be either due to hexagonal diamond or a sp3-rich\nphase or nanocrystalline diamond. Shroder, Nemanich, and\nGlass13 attributed this peak to sp3 carbon vibrations.\nKohanoff27 predicted by theoretical considerations two peaks\nat 1237 and 1306 cm21 to be due to hexagonal diamond. The\npeaks we observe at 1180 and 1305 cm21 cannot be con-\nfirmed as that belonging to hexagonal diamond, because Ra-\nman scattering alone is not adequate to prove that hexagonal\ndiamond inclusions are present in these films. Nevertheless,\nthe normalized area of the 1180 cm21 peak ~normalized to\nthe Raman signal between 1000 and 1650 cm21! is plotted\nagainst sp3 content of the films in Fig. 9. Since the error bars\nare very large Fig. 9 just shows a trend. The results empha-\nsize that the peak at 1180 cm21 is more pronounced in the\npresence of sp3 stretching in the carbon films. This is so far\nonly valid for ta-C films prepared by the MS\/IP technique. It\nFIG. 9.

It should be\nnoted that in the case of hexagonal diamond a \u2018\u2018puckered\u2019\u2019\nsp3 bond structure is present and the puckering could be\ncaused by excessive stress on a cubic sp3 bonded crystalline\nstructure as recently shown by Kohanoff.27\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe complexity of the Raman spectra of amorphous car-\nbon is discussed in this paper. Raman interpretation has to be\nperformed with great care due to information being lost as a\nresult of the very broad D line and G line features. This\nmakes the determination of cluster sizes and distributions\nbased only on Raman spectroscopy very difficult. Even using\nboth the ID\/IG ratio and the G linewidth only a crude esti-\nmate of cluster sizes can be elucidated.\nThis paper also shows that the G line feature and D line\nfeature do not require large cluster sizes as initially\npredicted.14,16 The G line may even be formed by olefinic\nsp2 bonds alone as well as sp2 stretch vibrations in benzene\nrings. The D line can be explained by interaction force con-\nstant effects and does not require large clusters either. The G\nlinewidth is determined by cluster size, the cluster size dis-\ntribution, and stress in the carbon films. It is impossible to\npredict the dominating line broadening factor, namely stress\nor cluster size. The G line position is determined by several\nfactors, namely, the hydrogen content, local environment of\nthe benzene clusters, the cluster size and their distribution,\nstress, and the superposition of the semicircle stretching at\n1486 cm21 with the Raman modes above 1500 cm21.\nFurther it has been shown that the 1180 cm21 line cor-\nrelates to the sp3 content in the films prepared by magnetron\nsputtering combined with Ar ion plating. So far this is the\nonly peak in the Raman spectrum ~beside the diamond peak\nat 1332 cm21! which can be attributed to sp3 bonded carbon.\nAll other features observed by Raman in the 1000\u20131650\ncm21 region are believed to have their origin in sp2 bonded\ncarbon.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsge-\nmeinschaft Project No. Eh 23\/29-1.
