Museums are seen as actively organising \npractices that sustain certain views of the world. The paper takes a single case \nstudy to illustrate how such practices may be currently organised. It suggests \nthat while analysis of cultural grammar may be illuminating, a narratological \nperspective is required in order to analyse practices in modern museums. Thus it \nis suggested that studies of narrativity may shed some light on contemporary \nunderstandings of temporality. \n \nIntroduction. \n \nThis paper focuses on an institution dedicated to organising temporal categories \n- the museum. I wish to suggest that the museum is one of the institutions where \nsociety is communicating, reiterating to itself, an understanding of the flow of \ntime. Thus museums can be seen as:- \n\"A potent social metaphor and ... a means whereby societies represent \ntheir relationship to their own history and to that of other cultures. \nMuseums, in this sense, map out geographies of taste and values, which is \nan especially difficult and controversial task when it is necessary to \nredraw the maps in response to major social change.\" \nLumley (1988:1). \n \n One can certainly unpack the categories of who is communicating to whom in \nthe sweeping claims made above (see for instance the work of Merriman 1991, \nBourdieu & Darbel 1991). Thus, professional curators communicate not just \npedagogically, but also in terms of intra-professional hierarchies competing and \ncontesting in terms of their 'product' (Fleming 1992). Equally visitors can be \nusing their visit as an 'information good' communicating their status both to \nequals and others (Kelly 1987). In this sense the universalism that museums \nclaim masks power relations; the question is whose interests does this \n'universal' advance (Bourdieu 1991)? \n \n However, what must be unpacked is not just the notion of a homogeneous \nsociety in communion with itself but also the methods of communication that are \nused. It is on the mechanisms of communication that this paper focuses, while \naccepting that they are socially specific processes. Theories of textual \n 2\npoetics, narration and temporality are deployed to study how a particular museum \n- the National Waterways Museum in Gloucester - represents the passage of time \nto its visitors. Though my account is kept at the level of 'textual \nconfiguration', it shows how the museum relies on visitors narratively (re-\n)configuring the meaning of the displays. We are dealing, I suggest, with an \nactive, generative situation rather than a static system that simply produces \n'meanings'. So, in the first section, I outline some elements of narrative \ntheory and how narrative generates a temporal dynamic in practices. Next, I \nprovide some background on the organisation of the National Waterways Museum. \nFinally I show how it is insufficient to interpret this museum with grammatical \naccounts alone, and argue the need for narrative theory.  \n \nNarrated Time: Theories of Narratives. \n \nIn this paper I shall mainly utilise the ideas of Paul Ricoeur in his \nmagisterial series Time and Narrative (1984, 1985, 1988) to show the emplotment \nof events in narratives and to bring to the fore the temporality of such \nprocesses. While Ricoeur's work can be used as a guide, it shares, with museums, \na tendency to claim universal importance for both the study and action of high \nculture. Thus posing a hazard that needs guarding against by giving more \nattention to power relations. Despite this caution, I argue that Ricoeur's ideas \nusefully emphasise the role of narrative practices in ordering the world. He \nargues that the experiential world is basically chaotic, that events do not \noccur in a ready-made, intelligible order. Rather, events have an order imposed \non them by their emplotment into a narrative; their significance is given by \ntheir placement in a story.  \n \n 3\n To take an example, this morning I might have walked under a ladder; an \nevent of minimal impact at the time. Instantly though, it suggests an ominous \nfuture course of events. The event is stretched forward in time by being \nemplotted in a superstitious narrative. As an alternative example, it could be \nthat I am writing this just after a drastic computer failure. Given the \nsuperstition of my local area I know that bad luck comes in threes - so I \nrapidly sort through the day to realise that the alarm-clock didn't go off and \nin my hurry I forgot my hat whereupon it promptly rained on me all the way to \nwork. Three events are now retrospectively emplotted in a woeful story. (See \nFabian 1991 for the inspiration for this accounting of time). The significance \nof the events is therefore determined by their emplotment in the narrative. A \nsecond story can illustrate how the significance of events can be altered. Let \nus suppose that I return home to find that I have been burgled. I retell the day \nwith the alarm clock and the rain compacted into one episode leaving the \ncomputer and burglary to make up three. The significance of events is not found \nwithin them but is located in how they are narrated. That is their meaning comes \nfrom the process of inter-signification between events and this process operates \ntemporally. The reading subject distends itself into the past and future. \n \n What Ricoeur seeks to dispel is the notion of time as a succession of \npoint-like \"nows\". He regards this as 'inhuman' time that is subjected to a \nnarrative configuring activity (1985:3) in the experience of people. As \nCastoriadis notes (1991, 1987), this argument raises the question of how an \n'identitiary time', of discrete events in a chronological sequence, comes to be \nconstructed. This public time cannot claim to be in some sense natural, for the \npractice of narration distends each 'point' into the past and future. The \npresent, as 'point', is replaced with the notion of passing. In this sense human \n 4\naction is placed in a Heideggerian framework of 'within-time-ness' (Ricoeur \n1984:61). All human activity is subject to a projective thrownness (Carr \n1986:39), in that all activity is already immersed in a historical stream and \nalready engaged with the past and future. Experience is distended because life \nis always 'Being-ahead-of-itself' (Ricoeur 1988:64), embroiled in a future with \nwhich it must cope using understandings organised from the past (DeConcini \n1990). Thus, Carr (1986) suggests that each human action already has a basic \nnarrative structure. Narratives are not just added to an inchoate temporality by \ninterpretive practices. Adapting Merleau-Ponty's example (1963), when we see the \nface of a cube it is seen as part of an object extended in space. Likewise any \nmoment is just part of a temporal object that is extended in time. Events are \nalready narrative, that is, they are performed with respect to a possible future \nand based on an interpretation of the past. Ricoeur suggests that this is part \nof a human need to provide meaning to events through narrative closure; what he \nhas termed \"the tragic will to totalise\" (1992). Borrowing from Schutz, Carr \nsuggests this envisaged endpoint is a 'future perfect' (1986:78); we look on our \npresent and past as if from a possible point in the future and then make sense \nof events in order to support that position.  \n \n The implication of such analyses is that narratives temporally situate \npractices. When one is in the middle of a Hitchcock film, understandings of the \nprevious events portrayed and the possible outcomes are kept open awaiting \nradical and probably repeated revision. (Such a process allows one to create \ninterpretations never intended in the original script.) But equally, our \nattempts to emplot things in coherent narratives do not always succeed. For \nalthough narratives require events to be part of a whole, events are also \nspatially extended in a series. Our synoptic judgement that knits stories into a \n 5\nmeaningful whole, does not have an infallible view. The idea of the 'future \nperfect' view leaves room for error and mystery and also resolves the need for \nretrospective intelligibility (Ricoeur 1984:157). While in the stream of \nactivity it enables a sense of progressive contingency, allowing new occurrences \nand twists in the plot, but also the ascription of meaning to events (Ricoeur \n1985:39). Meanwhile, the events must be able to support the various resolutions \n(Castoriadis 1991,1987). Thus- \n\"Looking back from the conclusion to the episodes that lead up to \nit, we have to be able to say that this ending required these sort \nof events and this chain of actions. But this backward look is made \npossible by the teleological movement directed by our expectations \nwhen we follow the story. This is the paradox of contingency\". \nRicoeur (1980:174). \n \n It is my contention that this narrative theory can also apply to museums. \nMuseums can be understood as machines that inscribe time on space. The museum \nbuilding, through its layout, its spatial configuration, organises time within \nits walls (Harbison 1977:146). Museums tend to encapsulate time, using their \nanalytic categories to segment it and present it in terms of periodised displays \nand galleries. Time is manipulated in terms of the amount and organisation of \nthe space accorded to historic events, with no fixed formula relating the amount \nof space to the duration of the event. Rather the amount of space is decided by \nthe significance and importance of the event, and reciprocally marks the event \nas significant and important. There is no need for a chronological sequence, one \ncan jump ahead in time or flash-back. However, instead of aiming to create a \n'suspension of disbelief' (as in fiction), most institutions create a series of \nspaces that are ordered to give coherence and meaning to their contents \n 6\n(Harbison 1977:147). As such the spaces are not sufficient to themselves but \nmutually implicating, linking the sense of one with the others. To cross the \nthreshold is to enter a symbolic stage that supports the poetics and narratives \nthe museum works to inscribe on itself. But such poetics rely upon the practices \nof the viewer. And I wish to suggest that in museums, like the National \nWaterways Museum in Gloucester, the tendency is to call upon narrative \npractices. The 'wandering subjectivity' of the visitors is called to reach \nforwards to grasp the possible path and outcomes of a story, while also reaching \nback along their path to make sense of a display. \n \nThe National Waterways Museum: A Story-Driven Institution. \n \nIn the light of the above theories it seems significant that in the post-war \nperiod, and the more recent heritage boom, narratives have become the organising \nprinciple in several heritage institutions. These institutions cannot rely on \ndidactic methods that focus on an intellectual, cognitive communication since a \nlarge potential audience does not seek such an experience (Annis 1986). Many \nheritage centres downplay the custodial role of museums since they are not based \non collections of objects. Rather than conceiving of themselves as shrines or \ntreasure-houses of priceless relics, they exhibit features and items from the \neveryday. Such institutions cannot use displays that rely on visitors knowing \ntaxonomies of objects that, in turn, rely on the values of dominant groups \n(Macdonald and Silverstone 1990:181). Instead, they link their exhibits to \nvisitors through affective narratives. They are story-driven rather than object-\ndriven. The narratives are often aimed to encourage visitor identification with \npast peoples, via the bond of a shared humanity, and particularly through a \nsense of the everyday (Silverstone 1988:140). Displays tend to show the changing \n 7\nvalues assigned to objects in their use. Objects are given biographies by \nsituating them in narratives, both in terms of an overall history and in terms \nof illustrative vignettes. It is this action that I suggest has implications for \nthe way museums make sense of historical time. I shall examine this contention \nusing the case of the National Waterways Museum at Gloucester. \n \n This museum is located, along with two others, in renovated docks next to \na shopping arcade, an antiques market and an office development. The whole area \nhad fallen into disuse by the 1970s as trade on the Gloucester - Sharpness canal \ndeclined. The museum is housed in an old warehouse, left redundant by falling \nindustrial use of inland waterways. It is either ironic or fitting that such an \narea should be 'regenerated' by a museum concerned with its former use. The old \nwarehouse still has its industrial facade. Once inside the building there are \nvery few glimpses of the outside world (and then only in interstitial moments, \nsuch as when one leaves the exhibits to change floors). Visitors have to follow \na path from display to display. It is totally unlike Harbison's analogy of the \nmuseum and the dictionary (1977:145) since there is little choice about the \norder in which to approach exhibits: visitors must pass through one display to \nreach the next. There are few ways of by-passing sections. Even then, there is \nno form of guidance for picking and choosing a route apart from the sequential \narrangement of exhibits. Indeed subsequent sections are often not visible from \npreceding ones. The visitor is drawn along a set path picking up elements of \nstory then stopping at vignettes. This appears to be a trend that is influencing \ndesign in such diverse locations as the Timewalk in Weymouth, the Amsterdam \nHistorical Museum and proposals for the Canadian Museum of Civilisation. \n \n \n 8\n On entering the museum there is a brief display of placards to set the \nscene for canal building in 1793. \"Would you invest?\" visitors are asked. \nPassing into the next display the visitor is confronted with a video. This \ndepicts a rural idyll accompanied by chamber music. But visitors are told this \nis the beginning of an era of great changes, with a significant parallel to the \nFrench revolution, and they are given vignettes discussing the arrival of canals \nand how life will be changed. A variety of characters express their fears and \nopinions. A company agent stresses profits and the chance to link factories, \nmarkets and raw materials. An investor, talking with the agent, evinces fears \nthat canals will ruin his land, by bringing unsightly industrial uses to his own \narea. Villagers betray a fear of navvies as, \"Lecherous, drunken, violent. \nThat's what I hear. Like as not we'll all be murdered in our beds\". They also \ndiscuss whether it will only be the cities that gain or whether they too will \nbenefit from cheap goods. As the lights go down on this scene a voice-over \nrounds off the discussion and visitors must then move on to the next section. \n \n Walking out from the opening diorama, visitors encounter a section full of \nindustrial scenes and the (recorded) clank of steel. A panoply of industrial \nactivity illustrates themes such as the disruption of rural economies, \nconstruction activity, changing market relations and the broadening economic \nsystem. All about there are facsimile newspaper reports of the beginning of \ncanals - 'joy in the potteries as canal Bill passed'. There is a diorama of \nnavvies at work, and more background noise of cheering at the completion of a \ncanal. The inquisitive can stop and read explanations of how people are glad \nthat they may be able to get cheap goods. All visitors have to keep following \nthe twisting line of displays. After a while mention of rail competition occurs. \nTime is passing rapidly as visitors move through the displays. Suddenly there is \n 9\nanother video - of old men discussing their memories of working on the canals. \nBy the end of the floor displays are dealing with post-war nationalisation and \npictures from the sixties. There are exhibits here of the trading connections of \nGloucester along with pictures and artefacts from the docks' industrial past. \n \n The next floor still follows a wandering pattern but now there are \ndisplays illustrating different facets of canals. One display charts the growth \nand decline of the canal network. Then an interactive game explains how locks \nwork, followed by pictures of locks on the waterways. From thence to the next \nsection the visitor has to pass through the mock-up of a tunnel while the museum \ndeals with this topic. Emerging visitors encounter a section of tow-path with a \nfox on it. A display on aqueducts is followed by one on maintenance (where \nvisitors can stand with their heads inside divers' helmets looking into an \naquarium made to look like the inside of a canal). A brief section about life on \nthe canals is followed by some artefacts and cut-aways of boats and a simulator \nto allow visitors to drive a barge. The exit from this trail is then out through \nthe inevitable gift shop. \n \n \nThe Emplotment of Events. \n \nThe techniques of structural linguistics have been widely applied in cultural \nanalyses. Based on an idea of structures organising meanings the analyst \nattempts to reconstruct the cultural grammar expressed in an institution. Such \nanalyses tend to be founded on a synchronic system of mutually referring \nsignifiers (Carr 1986:50). The first part of this section illustrates how such \n'paradigmatic' relations are instantiated in the museum. But I wish to argue \n 10\nthat paradigmatic interpretations must seek to include the activity and \ntemporality of the observer. I show how my initial analysis relies on the \nstructures it observes being enacted diachronically. The second part of this \nsection, therefore, focuses on the often neglected 'syntagmatic' structure. \nSyntagmatic patterns are those to do with sequence and succession. Since the \ninstitution relies on displays being encountered in a sequence, I argue that \nsyntagmatic patterns cannot be overlooked. One is left with a poorer \nunderstanding if one does not include the diachronic, syntagmatic practices of \nvisitors. The balancing of sequential and holistic understanding appears to \nreturn us to the issues raised by theories of narrative comprehension. This \nbalancing, I argue, is the constructive activity that articulates the \nrepresentation of time in this particular museum. \n \n1. Paradigmatic Operations \nA paradigmatic analysis might begin to focus on the realm of metaphoric \nrelations. In terms of Gloucester Docks, the whole area could be read as a \nmetaphor for a transition from an industrial economy to one based on services. \nThe former industrial area was in decline but is now reinvigorated by new forms \nof activity. Such a story could be interpreted as a condensation of a particular \nreading of recent British history. The decline and renewal metaphor also finds \nexpression in the National Waterways Museum itself. The sections which show the \ncanals as dynamic elements of industrialisation are symmetrically counterpointed \nto economic decline and a new rural idyll that is composed of leisure access to \nthe waterways.  \n \n The substitution of leisure for work allows a topical closure to a story \nabout the waterways of Britain - what might be termed a 'redemptive unity' \n 11\n(LaCapra 1991:122). One can then begin to tease apart how this structure \norganises, and is embedded in, parts of the museum. The displays relate a world \nthat used to be of work but has now been converted to leisure (cf Bennett 1988). \nThere is a structural opposition between these two terms. They operate in a \nhomologous opposition to those of modernity and tradition. The early sections of \nthe museum portray the innovative, disruptive change brought to a preindustrial \nland. The later sections mark canals as signs of tranquillity. Industrial \nsections have few images of canals (their present association being so \npowerfully antiqued) but many period illustrations. The sections on leisure are \nmarked with reconstructed tow paths, replete with signs of rural harmony. They \nprovide a strong contrast with displays of unloading and toil. This structural \nopposition is elaborated by pictures that mark out the contrasts of modernity \nand a rusticated heritage, for example, there are pictures of Coca-cola being \nunloaded from a barge; the archetype of global capitalism in a vessel of the \npast. \n \n Even from my brief account of the museum it should be apparent that a \nvisitor would not encounter these oppositions: they must be constructed through \nher or his practices. Thus I now turn to Greimas in suggesting a temporality to \nthese structures (Ricoeur 1985:49, \u00c5i\u00c9ek 1991). Following Greimas, one looks to \nnot only binary oppositions but also to a utilisation of temporality in a \n'semiotic square'. Such a square stretches oppositions in 2 directions, firstly \ntowards an antipathetic term (eg white\/black) and also towards a 'residual' (eg \nwhite\/non-white). This posits at least another relation of 'residual' and \nopposite (ie non-white\/black) and then first term and opposite of residual \n(\u00c5i\u00c9ek 1991, Greimas 1985). Thus an account can have a driving force from the \nfirst term to its opposite, so this is the next object of scrutiny, but be \n 12\nunable effect closure due to the 'residual'. The Gloucester example could be \nread as being so ordered and then enacted spatially, so that the practices of \nvisitors construct first a world of work and then its transformation into one of \nleisure. Thinking with Greimas we have a first term that is labour. This is the \nnew economic world of industrialisation. \"The country is undergoing a \nrevolution. New towns and seaports are being built, new jobs are developing. \nLife in the towns with real wages and promises of freedom from toil on the land \nis tempting. Which life will you choose?\". The opposite term (leisure and \nrecreational use) is stressed in later sections. Thinking with Greimas also \nhelps show how this opposition is sustained by a strategic absence. A 'residual'  \nis excluded from this substitution - unemployment. The neat substitution of work \nthen and leisure becomes rather less sustainable if one includes local \nindustries destroyed by the competition that canals brought, or contemporary \nmass unemployment rather than post-industrial leisure (cf Shotter 1988).  \n \n The substitution of leisure for labour is spatially extended, in the \nseries of displays one passes through. This synchronic opposition is a \nretrospective organisation of the displays of the museum. The visitor's passage \nthrough the prescribed route constructs the transformation of landscapes of \nlabour into ones of leisure. And transformations are at the heart of narrative \npractices (Branigan 1992:49). As discussed earlier, it is only by looking back \nfrom the end of the story that the substitution appears. In Greimas, \"Narrative \nbecomes a special working through of contraries, subcontraries, converses and \ncontradictories\" (Branigan 1992:9).  \n \n2. Syntagmatic Operations. \n 13\nI suggested before that there is a distinction between brute sequence and \nnarrative. The displays outlined earlier are not 'enchained' in a succession; \nthey are causally as well as chronologically related (Cohan & Shires 1988:57). \nIndeed so strong is this implication that seeing two events depicted in sequence \nis enough to promote speculation as to their logical connections (Eisenstein \n1943). The museum makes use of this effect very strongly. \n \nLet us return to the vignette of an agent persuading an investor. The investor \nfears the consequences of the canals, the social disruption and so forth, but \nthe agent remains the voice of reason until the investor concludes \"I dare say \nprogress must have its way\". This is followed by another cameo where rural \nvillagers again appear fearful of change. They perform a plot role, as well as \nprovide historical information. The canals are scripted as parts of an erupting \nmodernity. The major anxiety of the representatives of the preindustrial \ncountryside is focused on navvies. Turning the corner, the next display visitors \nfind is of navvies discussing job opportunities, and the spate of engineering \nwork. Walking on, the next section encountered is full of cheering for the \ncompletion of the canal and the new economic regime it has brought. Even in this \nhalf of one floor each display is referred to by the next, prefigures it and \nrelies on the ones before it. Time is certainly not represented as a series of \nindependent 'moments' as in 'identitiary time' (Castoriadis 1987). Some events \ndo form satellites, small self-contained elements to add interest and variety. \nSome form the basis of the next section. The balance of redundancy to linearity \nis what provides the openness of the narrative as the visitor progresses through \nit - the forward openness in conjunction with the teleological orientation \nRicoeur termed 'the paradox of contingency'. It is a fine balancing act of the \n 14\nnecessary and superfluous, providing opportunities for multiple interests while \nuniting the whole.  \n \n However what constitutes an event, as we saw in the first part of this \npaper, is defined narratively. For the above mentioned displays are all part of \na section dealing with the boom of canals, a 'meta-event'. This is related to \nlater sections that focus on the running of canals, the way they were used, or \neconomic decline and the use of canals for leisure. Time is represented as being \nbroken into periods. The first part of the museum with its overarching story of \nthe rise and fall of canals can serve to temporally locate later sections. The \nprocess of location is reinforced by displays of the national canal network's \nexpansion and decline, providing the more abstract schema that can be \ninterpreted in terms of the events narrated about Gloucester. Likewise a section \non boat design can be connected by the visitor to the cargos that are \nillustrated, engine and horse-power changes to the displays of footpaths. Tools \nand equipment can also be fitted into the periodisation, making connections to a \npast industrial period. In the last section I suggested that there was a \nparadigmatic relation between these different elements of the museum. Here I \nwant to stress how they are syntagmatically structured by the visitors.  \n \n While walking around the path set out by the museum, visitors are asked to \nuse narrative competences to interpret history. The section on building up the \ncanal network, for example, stresses modernity and economic transformation. But \nby the time visitors are confronted by the decline of the canals and their \nrestoration for leisure, canals have become identified with tradition. A crucial \nturning point is provided in the sections on the use of the canals. Among the \nhistoric artefacts is the aforementioned picture of a barge at Gloucester \n 15\nunloading Coca-cola; we are invited to use our present associations of the \nproduct to create a distance from canal activity. Since Coca-cola is no longer \ntaken by barge around the country, this section can form a marker for an end of \nan era. Likewise a section using a video of workers on the canals works to \nreposition the ideas of modernity stressed in earlier sections. The video is an \noral history given by elderly former workers. Another marker of pastness rather \nthan modernity? \n \n Such scripting of the museum's contents comes through in other ways. Using \neveryday present knowledge, the nationalisation and attempted economic \nresuscitation of the canal system are emplotted as doomed. The futility of plans \nto make Gloucester \"The Sea Gateway to the West Midlands\" sets the scene for \nlater sections on the subsequent successful revitalisation as a leisure \nresource. These are logical sequences rather than just temporal sequences or \nlogical structures. It is possible logical sequences that can sustain interest, \nraise questions, intrigue, entertain and, yes, educate. Types of figures and \ndisplays play narrative roles in moving and developing the plot. They do this in \naddition to their historical role. Thus, by positioning canals as modern, the \nsections discussing canal building try to counteract visitors' initial \nassociations in order to help them to understand the historical situation. \nCanals are portrayed not as part of the landscape but as the results of very \nmodern forms of decision-making - helping bridge the distance to the past. The \nlater oral history video works to transform and reposition canals as objects of \nthe past, using reminiscences to associate them with a bygone era. With Ricoeur, \none can see that these operations begin to use the different temporal \nperspectives of each section, that they act to reopen the future of the past as \n 16\ncontingent, and then act to close it down as a retrospective necessity. This is \nan effect that is reinforced by the narration of events. \n \n \nTelling the Time: The Impact of Narration. \n \nNarration is needed when knowledge of events is unevenly distributed between \ncharacters and audience (Branigan 1992:66). It can, therefore, fit with an \neducational situation. But narrative structures are not innocent tools. I wish \nto draw particular attention to the process whereby certain originary events are \nemplotted and given a conclusion. The account is thereby given an ending, in the \nsense of narrative resolution. Such a scenario is very close to criticisms made \nof 'heritage' in general, that it tends to provide history with an end point in, \nand justification for, the present (eg Hewison 1987). \n \n The standard argument is that syntagmatic structures serve as permanent \ndeferrals of meaning. In each event is implicated the possibility of another, \nand each new section can revise our interpretations of the earlier ones. It was \nsuggested earlier that this deferral is ended by the closure provided by \nparadigmatic relations. The retrospective inevitability of the plot also acts to \nprovide closure. But I want to emphasise how narration has a similar effect in \nthis museum. Upon completion of a visit to the museum, and having passed through \nall the sections, the 'conclusion' is where the story of canals leads to the \npresent day and the modern situation of canals as landscape features - for \naesthetic and recreational use. The present is drained of contingency and set up \nas an end-point. Paradoxically, unlike sections about the past, it is not opened \nto future possibilities and revised appraisal. No narrative devices try to \n 17\nprovoke speculation on the future of canals; visitors are not drawn in to \nidentify the museum as an elegant solution worked out in contingent \ncircumstances - but as an outcome of an historical process. \n \n Moreover the structure of narration adds to this effect. The narrator is \nmostly present in terms of labels and texts, but also appears as a disembodied \nvoice (outside the events portrayed) in certain sections. In this museum, the \nnarrator is the most common position from which to see history unfold. But the \nvignettes, where characters speak, provide an opportunity to be inside events \n(Cohan & Shires 1988; Branigan 1992:100). They provide a different avenue to \nunderstand events, a different focal point for a different perspective - such as \nwhere the agent and investor, or the village locals talk.  \n \n This focalization helps represent the past as exotic and as domestic. The \ncharacter vignettes continually prompted me to empathise with the historical \nsituations portrayed. The life-size recreations of canal scenes, and a \npresentation involving illuminated dioramas with dialogue, encouraged an \nimaginative link to the characters. The use of 'dialect', period music, and \npaintings as backing for various exhibits stress not so much historical process \nas the alterity of an exoticised past (Samuel 1992). This 'negative ontology', \nthis sign of otherness (Ricoeur 1988:146), plays on a sense of time beyond \nexperience. Yet the use of whole dioramas of lived contexts, as they might have \nbeen, works to de-distanciate the past and aid identification by relating to a \nsense of lived time (Ricoeur 1988:144).  \n \n Such character dialogues are marked as departures, as perspectives, from \nthe neutral and impartial account of the narrator. The narrator's voice \n 18\nmobilises ideas of detachment, objectivity and anonymous authority embodied in \nthe texts and labels. This process works both ways, with the narrator giving a \nvoice to the museum and the museum giving authority to the narrator. The effect \nis reinforced by the male, BBC received pronunciation which is counterposed to \nbackground noises and cameos where characters speak (Bennett 1988:65). The \ncharacters speak in dialect accents. While being an accurate protrayal and \naiding understanding of their human situation, it accentuates the dispassionate \nvoice of the narrator. The historical characters are accurately situated; the \nnarrator aspires to a universal. And it is through the narrator that the visitor \ncomes to know the events. An opposition between the narration of events by \ncharacters, in a rustic dialect, and the narrator's received pronunciation is \ncrucially embedded in the authority structures of the institution. There is \ncertainly little sense that the historian is implicated in the history \ndiscovered, or that the past is recreated and not merely found (Ricoeur \n1984:97). The account of knowledge (the enunciated) is fundamentally separated \nfrom its creation (the place of enunciation). For a predominantly middle class \naudience such a voice may sound like a neutral universal. But, for subordinate \ngroups it may be that this accent marks a specific, hegemonic site of \nenunciation. Thus one might identify, through the focalizers, against the \nnarration. However, this does not appear to be the intended effect. \n \n The male narrator gives voice to the museum's knowledge. But he aims to be \nan omniscient vantage point, a knowing commentator (Carr 1986:59). In this sense \nthe inevitability of the story that is recounted is further reinforced, since \nthe raconteur always knows the outcome. In that way the sense of contingency is \nmarkedly downplayed, since the situation is portrayed in terms of retrospective \nwisdom that can always see the significant order among the chaos of events. \n 19\nFollowing Ricoeur, this form of narration allows the play of contingency, as the \nvisitor progresses through the museum, but no radical retelling of the story. \nAlternative histories are inhibited by the teleology of the narrative. The \nomniscient narrator gives few prompts about what is omitted. Yet the missing \ntopics are as vital to the account as those present (Shotter 1988). Indeed, in \nthem, power relations are writ large. The account would be disrupted were one to \nsuggest that the new economic order gave not only new choices to the areas \ntouched by the canals but also produced new constraints on the formation of the \nBritish working class. The products from around the world are remembered here, \nnot the conditions of their production. There is no recognition that the past \nthat has been created is one that is useful to the present (Hooper-Greenhill \n1992, Wright 1985:2). Despite using fictionalised vignettes, history is still \nset up as the immutable past; in other words, fiction is used as a rhetoric to \nmake the past accessible. If anything the 'naturalistic' appeal of narratives \nserves to play down the artifice in the account, suggesting instead an illusion \nof unmediated reality (cf Jordanova 1989:33). The possibilities of using \nnarratives to reveal the constructed nature of accounts are not explored. \n \n \nNarration and Museums.  \n \nIn conclusion, I want to draw out the wider strands that such an analysis \nimplicates and its limitations. Firstly, the way museums use space to organise \npractices to represent time has to be recognized (Annis 1986:169). I wish to \nargue that the interpretation of this museum's representation of time depends on \nwhether events are seen as being refigured according to our current needs or as \nalready having some narrative structure. I have suggested that it is narrative \n 20\npractices, rather than abstract structures, that invests meanings in displays. \nIndeed, it has been implied that this is a tendency caused by the undermining of \ndominant taxonomies (Silverstone 1988, Macdonald & Silverstone 1990) in an era \nof social fragmentation. This museum is not sustained by a classificatory \nstructure. There now has to be a human appeal that is based around intelligible \nclaims about how past events occurred. The most readily accessible way of making \nthis appeal is in terms of narratives. Perhaps we should not ask why history is \nthus represented but whether it could be otherwise. Rather than stressing the \n'vertigo' produced by current social changes perhaps:- \n\"We ought to ask instead whether the plea for a radically unformed temporal \nexperience is not in itself the product of a fascination for the unformed that \nis one of the features of modernity. In short, when thinkers or literary critics \nseem to yield to a nostalgia for order or, worse, to the horror of chaos, what \nreally  moves them in the final analysis, may be a genuine recognition of the \nparadoxes of time beyond the loss of meaning characteristic of one particular \nculture - our own.\" \nRicoeur (1984:72). \n \n A sense of time as narrative is embedded in this sort of museum. And it is \nnarrative practices that perform the past in the present (cf Wright 1985:14-15). \nBut in my narrative on narratives, it has been the consistent intent to \ndenaturalise what appears to be a self-evident account of the canals. And the \neffort that this takes appears to be an indicator of the appeal of narrative \ntemporality. Consistently emphasising the fabricated nature of narratives, is \nalmost a back-handed compliment. Perhaps the effort involved is a mark of how \nstories provide events with a 'minimal readablity' in western culture (Morris \n1988:194). Perhaps one can go a little further by suggesting a connection in the \n 21\nway dominant groups show the greatest support for narratives of progress \n(Merriman 1991) and are numerically over-represented amongst museum visitors. \nLikewise one can recognise the delegitimising of alternative narratives as \nbeneficial to currently dominant social groups. \n \n Work with visitors suggests the limits to this form of analysis. There is \nno basic story that is absorbed osmotically. Visitors actively take and rework \nthe elements of the museum, since, unlike reading, museum visiting is a social \nactivity. But then they are spinning more narratives (Silverstone 1988), \nconnecting personal and collective stories to the museum's account. Academic \ncommentators, in turn, spin more narratives about these accounts. The question \nis not whether or how visitors follow or deviate in various ways from a 'basic' \nstoryline. Rather it is that time is interpreted via narrative practices.  \n \nThus, what I wish to end on is the sense that we are now certainly telling more \naccounts of our past to ourselves. These are not just hegemonic accounts but \nreconstructions of accounts that take a multitude of forms - such as the \nbiographical videos of the BBCs community programming, or the efforts of oral \nhistorians to write the everyday stories of those marginalised by grand \nnarratives. Perhaps this narrative aporia expresses a need to order and reorder \nour pasts and render them accessible to human experience in human narratives. \nStories do not just tell a fixed past, but recreate pasts in the process of \ntelling. Within the museum system, the structure of alterity\/domestication of \nthe past is being bridged narratively. And these narrative structures allow \nvisitors to both 'relive' the past and then distance themselves from it. The \nmuseums provide a coherent account of time in which to insert personal \n 22\nknowledge. Perhaps a less linear narrative would invite visitors to retell \nhistory from different perspectives. \n \nAcknowledgements. \nMy thanks are due to Barbara Adam, Nigel Thrift and Klaus Dodds who read earlier \ndrafts of this paper and made invaluable suggestions.
