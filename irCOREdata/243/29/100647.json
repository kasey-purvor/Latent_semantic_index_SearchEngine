INTRODUCTION\nThe preliminary work of Soref et al. and the subsequent study\nby Pogossian et al. demonstrated the ability to produce single\nmode optical waveguides in silicon at telecommunication\nwavelengths with cross-sectional dimensions compatible\nwith standard photolithography [1, 2]. Immediate interest\npursued as this structure was a suitable candidate for low-\nloss, high-index-contrast waveguides capable of routing\noptical signals at the wafer scale. The integration of optical\ncomponents on a silicon platform also had the added\nbenefits of low-cost large-scale manufacturability utilizing\nexisting CMOS facilities and the possibility of amalgamating\nelectrical and optical functionality on a single wafer.\nConsequently, the miniaturized counterparts of many\nbulk optical components have been realized in silicon. These\ninclude detectors, couplers, filters, and sensors [3\u20136]. It is of\nparticular interest to control the propagation of individual\noptical wave-fronts in such devices. One method to achieve\nwavelength dispersion exploits the unique behavior of optical\nwaves propagating in a medium containing a periodically\nmodulated refractive index. Indeed, this approach has found\nextensive use in such areas as photonic crystals, distributed\nfeedback (DFB) lasers and optical spectroscopy. In one-\ndimension, the perturbation is referred to as a grating\nand serves as a robust and flexible tool in photonics\ntechnology. Depending on the desired outcome, gratings\ncan be implemented to acts as couplers, reflectors, mode\nconverters, optical filters among others [7].\nIn the case of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, a\nsurface relief structure provides the most straightforward\nmethod for fabrication of an integrated Bragg grating. Such\ndevices are inherently passive, although electrically tuneable\ngratings based on the plasma dispersion e\ufb00ect have been\ndeveloped [8] along with those which are thermooptically\ntuned [9]. The Bragg grating itself is typically formed\nthrough a lithographic patterning technique and an etching\nsequence, although, relatively recently, focused ion beam\nmilling has been used to realize higher-order mode con-\nversion and filtering in SOI [10]. Perhaps the benchmark\nfor performance of gratings in SOI waveguides remains the\nwork of Murphy et al. [11]. There, surface relief gratings\nwith a period of 223 nm were formed in 3 \u03bcm high SOI\nrib waveguides via interference photolithography and plasma\netching to a depth of 150 nm. The authors demonstrated an\noptical transmission dip of 8 dB at the resonant wavelength\n2 Advances in Optical Technologies\nof 1543 nm, for the fundamental TE mode. The device\nhad a transmission loss of nearly 10 dB which the authors\nattributed to sidewall scattering. The biggest drawback of\nthe fabrication method leading to surface relief is the\ninherent deviation from a planar surface, limiting the ability\nof further processing.This is particularly problematic in\nnanophotonics, where the required thin processing layers are\nquickly skewed by alterations of wafer topography.\nAn alternative method which we propose here involves\nthe well-established ion implantation process to introduce\ndopants and\/or structural modifications to the crystalline\nlattice. By selectively introducing ions using a masking\nprocess, the refractive index can be periodically modified to\nproduce a Bragg grating. The implantation process can alter\nthe refractive index through either compound formation,\nas in the case of oxygen implantation, or chemically inert\nstructural damage as achieved by self-irradiation [12, 13].\nApart from small volumetric changes, the result is a Bragg\ngrating retaining a nearly planar surface. This makes it a\nvery interesting candidate for photonic applications pos-\nsessing surface sensitive topography, such as wafer-bonding\ntechniques required for three-dimensional photonic circuits.\nTherefore, this paper investigates the formation of Bragg\ngratings via implantation of oxygen and silicon into SOI.\nTo the authors\u2019 knowledge, this preliminary work is the\nfirst report of integrated Bragg gratings in SOI waveguides\nformed via ion implantation.\n2. ION IMPLANTED GRATING DESIGN AND\nCONSIDERATIONS\nSome authors have already pointed out the possibility of\nfabricating isolated buried oxide regions through a high\ndose oxygen implantation [14] in order to create hybrid\nSOI\/silicon wafers for CMOS applications in a manner simi-\nlar to the buried oxide formed in the separation by IMplan-\ntation of OXygen (SIMOX) process [12]. Such formation\nis generally conducted using doses around 1018 ions\/cm2,\nwith energies of 150\u2013200 keV and at high temperatures\n(65\u25e6C) in order to prevent amorphization [15]. Traditional\nSIMOX processes need high dose implants in order to obtain\na stoichiometric oxide. In the case of grating fabrication,\nhigh dose is still a desirable process parameter, whereas\nthe implant energy will be lower as the oxide layer needs\nnot to be buried but close to the wafer surface. For this\nreason, implantation energy can be lowered to 20\u201330 keV.\nFollowing the implantation process, the substrate generally\ncontains a series of extended defects. Depending on the\nimplant condition these defects may include stacking faults,\ndislocation loops, amorphous clusters, oxygen precipitates,\nand columnar defects [16]. In general, SIMOX process\nrequires postimplant annealing treatment up to 1300\u25e6C.\nThe postimplant anneal is essential in order to finalize\noxide formation, as it stimulates oxygen di\ufb00usion and\nSiO2 formation via Ostwald Ripening [17], while repairing\nlattice damage. By this mechanism, small faulty zones and\nprecipitates tend to coalesce into bigger aggregations in order\nto achieve a more favorable energy configuration. Although\nthe structures reported here have not received such a high-\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nR\nefl\nec\nti\non\n(%\n)\n0 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6\nSlab height (microns)\n500 \u03bcm\n1000 \u03bcm\n1500 \u03bcm\nFigure 1: Coupled mode theory prediction of peak reflected power\nas a function of the silicon slab waveguide height for grating lengths\nof 500, 1000, and 1500 \u03bcm. Simulations are performed with regard\nto amorphous silicon induced via self-implantation. The depth of\namorphous silicon is taken to be 100 nm.\ntemperature anneal, it is likely that isolated precipitates of\nSiO2 are formed during the high temperature implantation\nstage.\nIn contrast, the low temperature self-irradiation of\nsilicon results in the production and accumulation of point\ndefects, defect complexes, and locally amorphous regions\nuntil it becomes thermodynamically favorable for the lattice\nto undergo a transition from the crystalline to amorphous\nstate [18]. Of particular interest to optical devices is the ensu-\ning increase of the index of refraction as a result of damage\naccumulation. The increase continues until the amorphous\ntransition, at which point the refractive index saturates to\na value approximately 0.27 higher (for a wavelength of\naround 1550 nm) than that of crystalline silicon [19]. It\nshould be noted that although propagation losses tend to\nbe high, amorphous silicon (a\u2013Si) has demonstrated guiding\ncapabilities. Therefore, if applied periodically, a\u2013Si serves as\na unique candidate for grating structures.\nIn order to achieve a first-order Bragg grating in silicon,\nthe Bragg condition,\n\u039b = \u03bb\n2Ne\ufb00\n, (1)\nrequires a period (\u039b) of 222 nm, assuming a wavelength (\u03bb)\nof 1550 nm and an e\ufb00ective index (Ne\ufb00) of approximately\n3.48. This poses a fabrication challenge since the lateral\ndamage\/straggle must remain below 55 nm in order to\nachieve adequate modulation. Since the implantation pro-\nfiles depend on the implantation energy, dose, temperature,\nimplantation angle, and ion mass, the lateral profile can be\nmanipulated by varying these parameters.\nThe implantation profiles can be construed using ion\nimplantation simulators. In the case of the oxygen implan-\ntation, in order to achieve a uniform dopant implantation\nto a depth of 70 nm and retain adequate lateral modulation,\nit was determined that a dual implant process was required.\nThe first implant utilized ion energy of 20 keV with a dose\nM.

A subsequent surface implant was\ncarried out at 10 keV with a dose of 0.8 \u00d7 1017 ions\/cm2.\nFor silicon self-irradiation, and implanting at a temper-\nature of 77 K to minimize dynamic annealing, a dose of\napproximately 1015 ions\/cm\u22122 is required to induce amor-\nphization [18]. The total damage to the lattice is charac-\nterized by the number of displacements per unit volume of\nthe crystal. When the defect contributions are higher than\na critical value, the substrate can be approximated as amor-\nphous. Although reported values vary, lattice displacement\nconcentrations in the range of 10% to 25% of the silicon\ndensity appear to satisfy this condition [20, 21].\nAssuming an impenetrable masking layer, it was deter-\nmined that to provide suitable lateral modulation the\nimplant energy should remain below approximately 60 keV.\nThe 60 keV implant limit also determines the extent of the\ngrating depth. Using similar analysis, a modulated index is\nexpected to exist to a depth of approximately 150 nm. Since\nthe degree of coupling from the forwards to the backwards\nmodes depends directly on the overlap integral of the mode\nwith the grating region, it is important to quantify the\nsuitability of the depth limitation.\nA two-dimensional coupled mode theory (CMT) ap-\nproach assuming TE modes in a slab SOI waveguide, with\nan upper-cladding of air, was applied to approximate the\nstrength of the grating [22]. Assuming an implantation dose\ncapable of rendering the silicon amorphous and taking the\ndepth of the implant to be fixed at 100 nm, the degree of\nmodal overlap can be altered by varying the slab height.\nThis is analogous to changing the silicon over-layer height.\nFigure 1 depicts the maximum reflected power for di\ufb00erent\ngrating lengths while varying the slab height, assuming\na lossless medium for simplicity. From the figure, it is\napparent that over 90% of the power is expected to be\nreflected at the resonant wavelength for slab heights on\nthe order of 2 \u03bcm and a grating length of approximately\n1500 \u03bcm. Similar analysis was performed assuming a 70-nm\ndeep grating consisting of a periodic oxide (as opposed to\namorphous silicon) and grating lengths of 1000 \u03bcm were\nfound to result in approximately 35 dB reflections.\n3. FABRICATION\nThe fabrication process is depicted schematically in Figure 2\nfor the cases of the oxygen implant and the silicon implant.\nFor the oxygen implanted samples, a 100-nm layer of silicon\nnitride was deposited onto a 1.5 \u03bcm over-layer SOI wafer\nusing LPCVD at 740\u25e6C. Electron-beam lithography then\nprovided the necessary resolution to produce the 222 nm\ngratings in the silicon nitride layer to a length of 1000 \u03bcm.\nThe patterned silicon nitride layer then served as the implan-\ntation mask. The samples were subsequently implanted\nfollowing the dual implantation process formulated above\nat an elevated temperature such that amorphization was\nprevented. Following implantation, the nitride mask was\nremoved.\nWhile fabricating oxygen implanted samples, several\nprocessing issues have been noticed that can negatively\ninfluence the device performance. First and foremost, the\nnecessity of high dose implantation associated with this\nis sputtering and target erosion problems. In the current\ncase, the nitride hardmask used for pattern definition tends\nto sputter as the implantation advances. This means that\npattern definition becomes more and more uncertain by\nthe termination of the implantation. The sputtering yield is\ngreatest on the mask sidewalls, as the angle between the ion\nbeam and the surface is not zero. Atomic force microscopy\n(AFM) measurements on the implanted target also showed\n4 Advances in Optical Technologies\n\u221212\n\u221210\n\u22128\n\u22126\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n(d\nB\n)\n1520 1530 1540 1550 1560 1570 1580\nWavelength (nm)\nFigure 3: Experimental TE response of oxygen implant Bragg\ngrating.\nsurface erosion of the order of 10 nm. This means that the\ngrating response could also be influenced by the surface\nmodification.\nThe silicon implanted samples were implemented on a\n2.2-\u03bcm over-layer SOI wafer. The wafers were subject to a\nthermal oxidation resulting in a 40-nm silicon dioxide layer.\nThis layer serves as a bu\ufb00er aiding the removal of the pho-\ntoresist following implantation. A 7000-\u03bcm grating pattern\nwas produced holographically in photoresist using a Lloyd\u2019s\nmirror setup and a 325-nm HeCd laser. The photoresist\nlayer then serves as the low-energy implantation mask. After\nexposure and development, scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) images determined the photoresist thickness to be\n100 nm. Si implantation was carried out at energies of 50\nand 70 keV and a nominal dose of 1 \u00d7 1015 ions\/cm2 at 77 K.\nFollowing implantation, the photoresist mask was removed,\nfollowed by the oxide bu\ufb00er layer.\n4. RESULTS\nOptical transmission spectra were obtained utilizing a\ntunable laser operating in the range of 1525 to 1570 nm.\nFor the oxygen implanted samples, the signal was coupled\nto the waveguides using an objective lens. Light was then\nmeasured via a free-space power meter at the output. Prior\nto the objective lens, a beam splitter and half-wave plate\nwere inserted to provide discrimination between TE and TM\nmodes. The silicon implants were measured in transmission\nin a similar fashion, except for the use of a low-loss tapered\noptical fiber to butt couple light into the waveguide.\nFigure 3 shows the TE mode of the \u201cas-implanted\u201d oxy-\ngen implanted sample, following the removal of the nitride\nmask. The peak response occurs at approximately 1547 nm\nfor the TE polarized light and shows a discrimination of\napproximately 10 dB. This appears to be a promising result,\nconsidering no post implantation annealing was preformed.\nUsing CMT analysis, the expected result on reflected\npower of a grating formed of SiO2 can be overlaid with\nthe previous result to compare the expected and measured\ngrating response. It is also possible to approximate the index\nof refraction responsible for the response in Figure 3 as\na single fit factor, by assuming that the oxygen implant\n\u221260\n\u221250\n\u221240\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n10\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n(d\nB\n) 1520 1530 1540 1550 1560 1570 1580\nWavelength (nm)\nExperimental\nSimulated (index = 3.08)\nSimulated (oxide formation)\nFigure 4: Simulated response of oxygen grating corresponding to\nexperimental results.\nachieves a depth of approximately 70 nm. The result is shown\nin Figure 4.\nFrom Figure 4, it is shown that the expected transmission\ndrop, assuming complete oxide synthesis, is on the order\nof \u221255 dB, suggesting that the current results could be\ndramatically improved. Further, we approximate the index\nof refraction of the \u201cas-implanted\u201d region to lie at around\n3.08. What is thus clear in this preliminary work is that\nthe high dose, high temperature oxygen implantation, does\nnot form continuous volumes of SiO2. In agreement with\nprevious work [17], this should only be expected following\npostimplant annealing at around 1300\u25e6C. An e\ufb00ort to\nfabricate gratings with fully formed oxide is currently in\nprogress.\nThe resultant data for the 50 keV and 70 keV silicon\nimplanted samples for TE light are shown in Figures 5\nand 6. The 50 keV samples show a wavelength suppression\nof approximately \u22125 dB at approximately 1530 nm with\nthe oxide layer intact. Upon removing the oxide layer,\nthe response drops to an extinction of around \u22123 dB.\nSEM images determined that no residual photoresist mask\nremained on the oxide and, therefore, suggested the damage\ninherent in the oxide layer contributes to the grating\nresponse. For the case of the 70 keV implant with the oxide\nremoved, the sample exhibited a \u22125 dB suppression. The\nspectral response of the 50 keV response is in agreement\nwith the CMT model for the holographically defined 220 nm\ngratings, however, a \u22123 dB suppression corresponds to an\nimplanted index of only 3.493. This value is lower than\nexpected for completely amorphized silicon and is either a\nresult of ion straggle inflicting damage underneath the mask\nmaterial reducing modulation or is a result of incomplete\namorphization. For the 70 keV samples, the implant depth\nis approximately 170 nm, and the corresponding index to\nproduce the \u22125 dB extinction is 3.491.\nIt is noted that for both the oxygen and silicon implanted\ngrating devices there exists a deviation from the anticipated\nresonant wavelength of 1550 nm. This can be attributed to\nM. P.

In\nthe case of electron-beam lithography, we might anticipate\na deviation in \u039b on the order of a few nm\u2019s, reflected in\nthe small deviation from the resonance at 1550 nm of only\n\u223c3 nm, while in the holographic lithography process, a slight\nangular misalignment of the Lloyd\u2019s mirror setup of 1\u25e6 leads\nto a change in the Bragg wavelength of \u223c25 nm (a direct\nresult of the dependence of \u039b on the angle between the\ntwo mirrors). The measured resonance of \u223c1530\u20131532 nm\nreflects a misalignment of the Lloyd\u2019s mirror setup of \u223c1\u20132\u25e6.\nFor this preliminary work, we find these results encouraging\nwhile recognizing that control of the lithographical process is\ncritical to achieve precise resonance wavelengths.\nIn an attempt to improve the lateral modulation, a\n300\u25e6C anneal for 10 minutes was performed on the silicon\nimplanted samples. This annealing process was aimed to\nremove primary defects such as di-interstitials and di-\nvacancies (which can be found at the end of the implanted\nrange in ion beam amorphized silicon) while retaining the\namorphous structure itself [18]. As a result, amorphous\npockets should remain and, in e\ufb00ect, be defined with a\nsharper amorphous\/crystalline boundary. The results of the\nannealing on the transmission spectra are shown in Figures\n5 and 6. It is seen that the grating response is essentially\nquenched in both cases. This strongly suggests that the\nimplantation conditions were not su\ufb03cient to invoke com-\nplete amorphization. Hence, the grating comprised of simple\npoint defects in an otherwise crystalline structure. Therefore,\nthe low-temperature anneal was enough to eliminate the\npoint defects and lower the refractive index to near that of\nc-Si and consequently eliminating the Bragg response. At the\npresent time, further samples are being fabricated using a\nhigher implantation dose, and a report of the annealing will\nbe made in the future on the successful thermal processing of\nthese grating structures.\nNo attention was paid to minimizing the optical prop-\nagation loss in these relatively crude slab waveguides. It is\nanticipated that Fresnel loss, mode mismatch between the\n\u22128\n\u22127\n\u22126\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n(d\nB\n)\n1524 1526 1528 1530 1532 1534 1536 1538\nWavelength (nm)\n70 keV implant oxide removed\n70 keV implant 300 \u25e6C anneal\nFigure 6: Experimental TE response of 70 keV silicon implanted\nBragg grating.\ninput beam and the waveguide, and incomplete collection\nof the output would introduce a significant \u201ccoupling\u201d loss\nin this system of tens of dB. Of some importance to these\nspecific devices is the excess loss caused by the introduction\nof implantation induced lattice damage to the SOI (as in the\ncase of the silicon implantation). This has been previously\nmeasured to be as much as 1000 dBcm\u22121 for almost com-\npletely irradiated rib waveguide structures [23]. Given the\nshallow depth of the implantation used in this study (on\nthe order of 100 nm) and thus the relatively small overlap\nof the mode with the lattice damage, we expect an excess\nloss in the region of 10 dB. Although this is undesirable, it is\nlikely to be reduced significantly following low-temperature\nannealing [19]. The balance between minimizing optical loss\nand producing a strong interaction between the propagating\nmode and the grating will be dealt with in some detail in a\nfuture publication.\nFor this initial study, grating fabrication is limited to\nslab waveguides, although they will ultimately be of more\npractical importance when incorporated into rib waveguides.\nWhereas rib waveguides can be made e\ufb00ectively single mode\nby suitable choices of rib width and etch depth [2], slab\nwaveguides of the thicknesses used in this study are highly\nmultimode. The resonances shown in Figures 3 to 5 result\nfrom the coupling of light in the forward propagating\nfundamental mode into the reverse propagating fundamental\nmode. One might also expect to see resonances due to\ncoupling from the forward propagating fundamental mode\ninto higher-order reverse propagating modes or from higher-\norder forward propagating modes into reverse propagation\nof the same mode. The former type of higher-order res-\nonance is observed in the case of relief gratings on rib\nwaveguides where the higher-order modes are leaky [11].\nWe also expect to see this when implanted gratings are\nused in rib gratings. The higher-order resonances occur\nat wavelengths that are a few tens of nm lower than that\nof the fundamental resonance, corresponding to e\ufb00ective\nindex di\ufb00erences of 1\u20132% between low-order modes in these\n6 Advances in Optical Technologies\nstructures. In this work, however, we observed neither type\nof higher-order resonance. We believe that the former type\nwill be much weaker than in the rib waveguide case because\nof more complete mode orthogonality. The latter case is\nabsent because the input light couples predominantly into\nthe fundamental mode so that any individual higher-order\nmode has very little power in it to lose to resonant coupling.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis report demonstrated the viability of utilizing ion\ninduced refractive index change in the manufacture of an\noptical filter in silicon waveguides. Response curves typical\nof passive grating filters were achieved, and extinction ratios\nof \u221210 dB and \u22127 dB were found for oxygen implants and\n\u22125 dB and \u22122 dB for silicon implants for TE and TM\npolarized light, respectively. From CMT analysis, it appears\nthat the current results have the potential to be improved\nupon significantly. These implanted gratings could serve a\nuseful role in future three-dimensional integrated photonics\nwhose fabrication is contingent on surface sensitive bonding\ntechniques.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the Canadian Institute\nfor Photonics Innovation (CIPI), the Natural Sciences and\nEngineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the\nOntario Centres of Excellence (OCE) for partially funding\nthis work.
