Although \ninsects are known to have been used in the detection of crimes for a long time, there \nhas been no great increase in the popularity of the subject until the last 30 years. \nForensic entomology is recognized in many countries as an important tool in legal \ninvestigations. Unfortunately, it has not received much attention in some parts of the \nworld such as Kuwait and other Arab countries where the value of insect as \nindicators in criminal investigations has not been fully realised. \nFor forensic entomology to be effective in legal investigations, knowledge of local \ninsect assemblages and their population dynamics is essential. This study was \nconducted to gather database information on necrophagous flies and their \nsuccession on carrion using rabbits as experimental models. It allowed quantitative \nand qualitative comparisons to be made in four habitats (desert, urban, agriculture \nand coastal). In addition, the insects sampled from the carcasses were compared \nwith those collected from human corpses as part of recent investigations in Kuwait. \nEleven families of necrophagous flies were collected at four habitats; the most \nimportant families to breed on carrions were Calliphoridae such as Calliphora vicina \nRobineau-Desvoidy 1830, Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann 1819), Chrysomya \nmegacephala (Fabricius 1794) and Lucilia sericata (Meigen 1826), and \nSarcophagidae such as Parasarcophaga ruficornis (Fabricius 1794), Sarcophaga \nAfrica (Wiedemann), Wohlfahrtia nuba (Wiedemann 1830) and unidentified \nSarcophaga sp. which can used as forensic indicators to estimate the PMI.

Lord and Stevenson \n(1986) divided it into three components: urban, stored products and medico-\nlegal. The latter field is also termed medico-criminal entomology because of its \nfocus on violent crime (Haskell et al. 2008). Knowledge of the distribution, \nbiology and behavior of insects found at a crime scene can provide information \non when, where and how the crime was committed (Hall 2008). \nMany insects can be attracted to a decomposing body; however, flies (Diptera) \nand beetles (Coleoptera) represent the majority of total carrion fauna \n(Greenberg 1991). The insects invade the carrion in a typical sequence or \nsuccession; each group of insects is attracted to a certain stage of \ndecomposition. So, the type and composition of fauna found on a corpse are \nindicative of its stage of decomposition (Anderson 2009). Necrophagous flies \nare the first arrival at the carrion; they have ecological importance in its \ndecomposition and represent an important tool in criminal investigation as well \n(Catts and Goff 1992). Blowflies provide valuable clues in many aspects of legal \ninvestigations, particularly in estimating the time of death in cases where the \npostmortem interval (PMI) is prolonged and the value of other methods is \nlimited (Campobasso and Introna 2001). Two ways are used for estimation of \nPMI of human remains based on information on the development and \nsuccession of carrion insect species (Tabor et al. 2004). \n The rates of insect development and their pattern of succession on the carrion \ndiffer  from  country  to  country  and  even  from  area  to  area  within  the  same  \ncountry, mainly because of the variation in the topography and climate or \nweather. Thus, it is not possible to use the data available in one country and \napply it to the crime entomology in another country. Collection of information \nabout the composition and dynamics of the local communities of necrophagous \narthropods in the area where the crime took place is essential to use \nentomology effectively in legal investigations. \nIn Kuwait (and more widely, the Middle East), there is a lack of essential \nentomological information, which inhibits the progress of forensic entomology as \nan investigative tool. Only four species of blowflies are known to exist, and \nthese are Calliphora vicina (Meigen). Chrysomya albiceps, Lucilia cuprina \nPage 2 of 124 \n \n(Wiedemann), Lucilia sericata (Al-Houty 1989). It is not known what species of \nCalliphoridae will colonize a carcass, or whether there are differences in the \nspecies found in different locations. The speed of decomposition of the \ncarcasses has not been quantified, nor has the successional sequence been \ndescribed and quantified. \nThis study fills in many of these gaps using rabbit carcasses as experimental \nmodels. It allowed qualitative and quantitative comparisons to be made in four \nhabitats (coastal, agricultural, urban and desert). Sticky traps were used for \nsampling necrophagous flies which were attracted to visit the carcasses. The \nnecrophagous flies collected from rabbit carcasses were compared with those \ncollected from human corpses as part of recent investigations in Kuwait. \n1.1. Kuwait Geography \nKuwait is a small country of about 17.820km\u00b2 total area, occupying the north \neastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. It lies on the Arabian Gulf and is \nbordered  to  the  north  and  west  by  Iraq  and  to  the  south  by  Saudi  Arabia.  \nTopographically, the country is considered predominantly desert, however, it \nalso has a rich marine environment that includes the shoreline (170km) and \nopen water. Desert in Kuwait includes smooth, rough sand, flat areas, hilly \nareas, lush green parts and very dry desolate parts, but no real mountains or \nrivers (Jaman and Meakins 1998). Because of the scarcity of water resources, \nhigh salinity and poorness of sandy soil, only 1% of Kuwaiti land is cultivated. \nThe main agricultural areas are in Wafra, located in the south, adjacent to the \nborder with Saudi Arabia and Abdali, located in the north adjacent to the border \nof Iraq. Sulaibeya and Kabd, located Northwest of Kuwait, are the main dairy \nand sheep farming areas. Permanent pastures amount to about 8% of the total \nland supporting transhumant flocks of small ruminants and camels. \n1.2. Kuwait Climate \nKuwait\u2019s climate is hot and dry with little rainfall, 250mm a year. Rains normally \nbegin in November and continue intermittently until April. Apart from a few days \nin spring and autumn, the relative humidity in Kuwait is normally low. The \nsummer temperatures often reach 50\u00baC and the winter temperatures can drop \nto 10\u00b0C and even to -4\u00b0C in some nights. The prominent feature of the climate \nPage 3 of 124 \n \nis fluctuation of temperatures not only seasonally but also daily; the cool \nmornings can be followed by scorching afternoons. Another unpleasant feature \nassociated with the desert is sandstorms which occur throughout the year, but \nare most common between March and August (Jaman and Meakins 1998). \nThe harsh climate limits the number of animal species that can survive and \nthrive throughout the year (Jaman and Meakins 1998). For example, after \ndispersal of the Old World screwworm fly, Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve, to \nKuwait from Iraq in November 1997, it could not live long in this environment \nand disappeared in the next summer; screwworm flies need a wet and warm \nclimate to thrive (El-Azazy 1992; 1993; 2004). In such climate only the hardiest \nof plants and animals are tough enough to survive the wide variations of \ntemperatures, the unpredictable and meager rainfall and the discomfort of \nsandblasting by dust storms. Microclimates are of vital importance in helping the \nanimals that live in Kuwait make the best of their situation and maximize their \nchance of survival (Clayton and Wells 1987). Dead animals act as microhabitats \nin the desert give support to detritivores and decomposers including blowflies \n(Calliphoridae) which are the first visitors to carrion and are considered most \nimportant in recycling this organic material in the ecosystem in the desert. \n1.3. Blowflies in Kuwait \nBlowfly species were enumerated in the screen surveys of Clayton and Wells \n(1987), Al-Houty (1989) and Jaman and Meakins (1998), and myiasis-causing \nflies were recorded in human and animal cases in the published reports of Hira \net al. (1993; 1997; 2004) and in unpublished reports of veterinary and health \nsectors. These investigations are useful and informative with respect to animal \nbiodiversity and fly species list in Kuwait. \n1.4. History of research and development of forensic entomology \nForensic entomology as it is today is derived from a long sporadic history of \nresearch dating back to 13th century China (Greenberg and Kunich 2002). \nInsects are known to have been used in the detection of crimes for a long time \nand number of researchers have written about the history of forensic \nentomology (Benecke 2001; Greenberg and Kunich 2002; Gennard 2007). \nPage 4 of 124 \n \nDuring medieval times, the correlation between maggots on a corpse and the \noviposition of adult flies was not recognized. However, the realistic and detailed \nillustration of corpses containing maggots was not unusual (Amendt et al. \n2004). Illustrations of corpses colonized by maggots were recorded since the \n16th century (Klotzbach et al. 2004). The importance of insects in the \ndecomposition of human bodies was documented, as early as the 19th century: \nthe biologist Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Linnaeus) in 1767 said that three flies would \ndestroy a horse as fast as a lion would (Benecke 2001). \nUntil the mid-17th century, it was believed that under the right conditions \nmaggots spontaneously arose from rotten meat. In 1668, Francesco Redi \nrefuted the hypothesis of the spontaneous generation of life after the analysis of \nthe results of his experiments in which rotting meat was either exposed to or \nprotected from flies (Hall and Huntington 2008). Redi proved by his experiments \nthat maggots come from fly eggs deposited on rotten meat or putrefying \ncarcasses (Cruz 2006). Even today, some people still think that maggots are \nworms with no connections to flies (Goff 2001). \nThe first use of entomology as a forensic tool occurred in the 13th century in \nChina. The sickle of the murderer, which was used to kill a fellow farmer, \nattracted blowflies. The murderer confessed to the killing when he was \nconfronted with this entomological evidence (Greenberg 1991; Hall and \nHuntington 2008). Half a millennium later, during mass exhumations in France \nand Germany in the 18th and the 19th centuries, medico-legal doctors, such as \nReinhard and Hofmann, observed that buried bodies are inhabited by \narthropods of many kinds (Benecke 2001). \nThe  first  application  of  forensic  entomology  in  the  west  was  in  the  mid-19th \ncentury in France where Dr. Marcel Bergeret, a hospital physician used insects \nin a legal case of a murdered newborn baby found mummified behind a \nchimney (Goff 2001). During autopsy, Dr. Bergeret found larvae of a flesh fly,  \nSarcophaga carnaria (Linnaeus 1758). In estimating the PMI, he assumed that \nmetamorphosis occurred within one year and concluded that the current \noccupants of the building could not have been the murderers. The court \naccepted this proof (Gennard 2007). However, in that case, the forensic \nexaminer was of the opinion that the development of the adult flies took about \nPage 5 of 124 \n \none year; clearly his results would be questionable today. At that time, forensic \nexaminers had only a poor understanding of insect biology (Amendt et al. \n2004). In spite of any putative errors, Bergeret was the first westerner to use \ninsects in a forensic investigation (Hall and Huntington 2008) and paved the \nway for later studies (Hall and Huntington 2009). \nFrom 1883 to 1898, J.P. M\u00e9gnin, the accredited founder of forensic entomology, \npublished several articles dealing specifically with forensic entomology (Hall and \nHuntington 2008). However, Amendt et al. (2004) considered Yovanovich \nbeside M\u00e9gnin the first contributors to forensic entomology as they attempted to \nevaluate insect succession on corpses. \nIn the 20th century, a lot of scientists worked on many aspects of entomology \nincluding the biology and behaviour of insects. These works have contributed to \nthe advancement of entomology in general and increased understanding of \ninsect biology and ecology; many publications appeared dealing with the \nidentification and taxonomy of insects (e.g. Aldrich 1916; Knipling 1936 and \n1939; Hall 1948; Hall and Townsend 1977), assemblage of insect fauna \nassociated with carrions (e.g. Fuller 1934; Reed 1958; Payne 1965) and \nbionomics of insects (e.g. Norris 1965). Although the objectives and results of \nthese entomological studies are not relating directly to legal matters, they \nconstitute the foundation upon which forensic entomology is built. \nIn the early 20th century, entomological evidence has been used sporadically in \nseveral murder cases in Europe with increased success (Smith 1986). Nuorteva \net al. (1967) and Nuorteva et al. (1974) were among the first to discuss the use \nof forensic entomology for the estimation of PMI in this continent. \nIn the second half of the 20th century there was been an increasing interest in \nforensic entomology and the topic was revived by many researchers such as \nRodriguez and Bass (1983), Greenberg (1985), Lord et al. (1986), Goff et al. \n(1986), Introna et al. (2001). Although the amount of research increased in this \nfield, there was no great increase in the popularity of the subject till the last \nthirty years (Gupta and Setia 2004). At the end of the 20th century and \nbeginning of the 21th century in criminal investigations, forensic entomology is \nrecognized in many countries as an important tool (Gennard 2007; Haskell et al. \n2008; Byrd and Castner 2009; Amendt et al. 2010).  \nPage 6 of 124 \n \nForensic entomology continues to progress as a science, gaining credibility as \nresearch leads to a greater understanding of insects and refinement of \nmethods. Employment of DNA analysis (Wells and Sperling 2001) and use of \nscanning electron microscopy (Liu and Greenberg 1989; Wells et al. 1999) has \nhelped improve accuracy in the classification and identification of insect \nspecies. Recent research has brought the possibility of extraction human DNA \ntissue (Wells et al. 2001) and gunshot residue (Roeterdink et al. 2004) from the \ngut contents of feeding maggots. Entomotoxicology (detection of narcotics and \ntoxins in the tissue of feeding insects on a decaying corpse) is an emerging field \nproviding valuable tools in the investigation of homicides, suicides and other \nunattended deaths where chemicals are involved (Goff and Lord 2009). \nDespite great strides having been made in fundamental and applied research, \nthere are many questions yet to be answered (Amendt et al. 2010). Forensic \nentomology is still a young discipline and there is still much room for progress \n(Amendt et al. 2004). The scientific literature available on this topic, although \nconstantly growing, remains small when compared to many other biological and \nlegal subjects. Likewise, the number of qualified participating forensic \nentomologists capable of fully utilizing insect evidence is currently very small \n(Hall and Huntington 2008; Hall and Huntington 2009). \nForensic entomology as a science and profession faces many challenges as it \nattracts the public interest and also offers an opportunity for expanding research \nrelated to forensically important arthropods (Byrd and Castner 2009). This field \nof study has unfortunately not received much attention in some parts of the \nworld such as in Kuwait and other Arab countries, where the value of insects as \nindicators in criminal investigation has not been fully realized. In addition, there \nis still a paucity of information on the composition of carrion insect assemblages \nand their succession patterns to be used in legal investigations, particularly the \nestimation of PMI. The challenge to apply forensic entomology is increased \nbecause of the fact that the pronounced geographic variability of the carrion \ninsect community does not allow to use the available data from one \nbiogeographic area to another (Anderson 2009). This supports the need for \ngenerating a database of sarcosaprophagous insects in a variety of geographic \nlocations and habitats. The output of the combination of experimental studies \nusing animal models and practical case work will familiarize officials with the \nPage 7 of 124 \n \nforensic applications of entomology and will provide specialized individuals to \nanalyze and interpret this type of data (Gill 2005). For maintaining advancement \nof the discipline, there is perhaps also a need to incorporate it in the academic \ncurriculum at the Master\u2019s level under Applied Entomology\/Zoology \n(Varatharajan and Sen 2000). Students provide a rich supply of enthusiasts who \ncan contribute to forensic entomology as part of their studies or degree program \n(Gennard 2007). Without extensive research in the use of insects as indicators \nin death investigations under different scene circumstances and environmental \nconditions,  this  science  will  not  be  convincing  in  the  rigid  and  factual  \ncountenance of law. \n1.5. Decomposition and carrion insect succession \nDecomposition is a continuous process, beginning at the point of death and \nending when the body has become a skeleton (Goff 2010). Although this \nprocess is continuous (Schoenly and Reid 1987), many authors have divided it \ninto three to six discrete stages (Fuller 1934; Reed 1958; Payne 1965; Coe \n1978; Braack 1986; Early and Goff 1986). However, there does not appear to \nbe a firm relationship between these and the total number of species of insect \nobserved in each study (Goff 2010). These variations in the numbers of the \nstages of decomposition could be due to the type of carcass used, geographic \nregion  and  author  observation.  Extremely  small  carcasses  such  as  those  of  \nlizards and toads (Cornaby 1974), bird and mice (Blacklith and Blacklith 1990) \nand other small rodents (Payne 1965) are reported to decompose very quickly \nwith no demarcation of any stages. However, Bornemissza (1957) and Moura et \nal. (1997) described five stages using guinea pig and rat carcass respectively. \nSome studies like that of Parikh (1999), Vij (2001) and Pillay (2004) have \ndescribed the changes after death under three headings of immediate, early \nand late stages. Reed (1958) using dog carcasses in Tennessee, Rodriguez \nand Bass (1983) using human corpses in Tennessee, Braack (1986) using \nImpala carcasses in South Africa and Tantawi et al. (1996) using rabbit \ncarcasses in Egypt, proposed four stages of carrion decomposition, namely \nfresh, bloat, decay and dry. This categorization is perhaps the most convenient \nto  be  easily  applied  and  marked  out  in  experimental  studies  and  case  work  \n(Morris 1988; Aggarwal 2005). However, in Hawaii, Goff and other authors have \nPage 8 of 124 \n \nobserved five stages of decomposition using pig or cat carcasses (Early and \nGoff 1986; Tullis and Goff 1987; Avila and Goff 1998; Davis and Goff 2000; \nShalaby et al. 2000). \nA corpse, whether human or animal, goes through a process of dramatic \nphysical, biological and chemical changes during decomposition (Henssge et al. \n1995). Thus, the carrion becomes attractive and presents a temporary and \nprogressively changing habitat and food source for a wide variety of organisms \nranging from bacteria and fungi to vertebrate scavengers (Goff et al. 1986). The \narthropods comprise a major element of the carrion community (Payne 1965; \nAnderson 2009; Kreitlow 2009). Of the different groups of arthropod that have \nbeen categorized based on their attraction to the corpse in different stages of \ndecomposition, four basic arthropods corpse relationships have generally been \naccepted: Necrophages e.g. blowflies, which feed and breed on the \ndecomposing tissue of the carrion; Necrophiles e.g. beetles, which are \npredators and parasites of necrophagous fauna, feeding on other arthropods; \nOmnivores e.g. wasps and ants, which feed on the carrion and its colonizers \nand Opportunists e.g. spiders, which are found in and around the carrion but \nonly use it as an extension of their own environment (Smith 1986; Goff 1993; \nKreitlow 2009). \nThere are over 60 insect families which play an important role in carrion ecology \n(Smith 1986). However, only the families (Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and \nMuscidae) of Diptera (Flies) and the families (Silphidae, Staphylinidae, Cleridae \nand Dermestidae) of Coleoptera (beetles) are the most important to be used in \nforensic entomology (Aspoas 1994; Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996). \nThese insects do not visit carrion at the same time, but in sequential 'waves'; \neach stage of decomposition is attractive to a different groups of \nsarcosaprophagous insects. Some are attracted directly by the carrion, which is \nused as a food source or an oviposition medium, whereas other species are \nattracted by the large aggregation of other insects, which provide them a food \nresource (Anderson 2009). \nThe postmortem changes during decomposition process and insect activity has \nbeen described by Aggarwal (2005), Kreitlow (2009) and Goff (2010). The fresh \nstage begins at the moment of death and continues until bloating is first evident. \nPage 9 of 124 \n \nIn this stage, there are no visual or odor effects obvious to humans; however, \nsome insects such as calliphorids and sarcophagids are able to detect the early \nstages of decomposition (Anderson 2009; L\u00e9Blanc and Logan 2010). Due to the \nautolysis of tissues and the activity of bacteria and fungi, from both the intestine \nand the external environment, gasses are produced (Knight 1991; Clark et al. \n1997; Introna and Campobasso 2000). This results in abdomen inflation and the \ncommencing of the bloated stage. In this stage more necrophagous flies are \nattracted to the carrion reaching a peak and early larval instars are observed in \nnatural openings and injuries as well. The beginning of the decay stage is \nmarked by release of gasses as the abdomen deflates. At this stage \ndecomposition is advanced with a pronounced odor; most of the flesh has been \nremoved with the departure of the calliphorids and sarcophagids and arrival of \ncoleopterans. The dry stage is the final stage of decomposition where most soft \ntissue has disappeared with that remaining in the abdomen. The odor starts to \nfade. At this stage, the carcass consists of only dry skin, cartilage and bones \nand the beetles prevail on the remains. \nThe main objective of insect succession studies is to study the colonization \npatterns of insects in a particular area, often with the goal of obtaining data that \ncan be applied to forensic investigations involving insects in the event that a \ndeath occurs in a similar environment (Kreitlow 2009). Because of ethical, moral \nand logistical constraints, few researchers (Rodriguez and Bass 1983, 1985) \nhave had the chance to work experimentally on human corpses (Hart et al. \n2008). Most published information on insects involved in human decay comes \nfrom case studies (Smith 1986; Williams 2008). As useful as these may be, they \nare usually just a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the process; therefore, the majority of the \nstudies on decomposition and insect succession have been done on non-\nhuman carcasses (Wells and LaMotte 2009). However, experimental animals \nare not always available for use, such as in Italy, where, bureaucracy makes it \nprohibitively difficult. Here, researchers resort to studying the carrion fauna on \nthe human cadavers which turn up as part of real legal investigations (Magni et \nal. 2009).  \nA variety of different types and sizes of animal carcasses have been used to \nstudy decay processes and insect succession including rabbits (Denno and \nCothran 1976; De Jong and Chadwick 1999), cats (Early and Goff 1986), dogs \nPage 10 of 124 \n \n(Reed 1958, Jir\u0229n and Cart\u0213n 1981), guinea pigs (Fuller 1934; Bornemissza \n1957), mice (Putman 1978), rats (Baumgartner 1988; Moura et al. 1997; \nTomberlin and Adler 1998), chickens (Hall and Doisy 1993; Arnaldos et al. \n2005), deers, bears and alligators (Watson and Carlton 2005), lizards and toads \n(Cornaby 1974), turtles (Abell et al. 1982) and elephants (Coe 1978), foxes \n(Easton 1966; Smith 1975) and Monkeys (Omer et al. 1994). \nPig carcasses are now used in most carrion ecology and forensic entomology \nstudies as they are the best models for human corpses. Pigs are relatively \nhairless, monogastric and have similar skin type and comparable sizes with \nhumans (Catts and Goff 1992; Anderson 2001). However, these animals are not \neasy to obtain in Arab countries including Kuwait. Rabbits have been used \nsatisfactorily as animal models to study carrion ecology and insect activity by \nmany researchers in different habitats and geographic locations (Denno and \nCothran 1976; Tantawi et al. 1996; Bourel et al. 1999; De Jong and Chadwick \n1999; Shah and Sakhawat 2004). These animals are easily handled and can be \nobtained in nearly uniform size and weight to compare decomposition rates, \ncarrion insect compositions and succession patterns in different habitats. \nHowever, caution in the use of successional sequences produced using non-\nhuman models is necessary, even if a good model such as a pig is employed \n(Lane 1975; Catts and Goff 1992). \nThe studies referenced above, that used rabbits to study forensic flies, were in \ndifferent localities e.g. in temperate regions (France), in subtropical regions \n(Egypt) and at high altitudes in Colorado where temperatures are low (USA). \nThe decomposition process of rabbit carcasses and the pattern of arthropod \nsuccession were the same as those were observed in other experimental \nanimals and the forensically important insects collected were representative of \nthe geographical areas where each study was conducted \nGenerally, the size of a carcass has no obvious effect on the composition of the \ninsect fauna or succession pattern, but there is a positive correlation between \nthe size of the carrion and the number of flies bred (Kuusela and Hanski 1982; \nHewadikaram and Goff 1991). No differences were observed between patterns \nof succession based on the use of the cat or pig carcasses in the same habitat \n(Early and Goff 1986).  \nPage 11 of 124 \n \nCarrion fauna associated with pig carcasses have been compared with those on \nhuman corpses in the same habitat (Carvalho et al. 2000). However, no data \nare available to compare the insect fauna on rabbit carcasses with those on \nhuman corpses. Arnaldos et al. (2005) used the entomological data obtained \nfrom experimental studies using chicken carcasses in order to determine PMI in \nreal forensic cases. They concluded that the experimental data may be \nconsidered as representatives of the circumstances occurring in human corpses \nand may act as a valid database of sarcosaprophagous fauna in the same \nhabitat. \nDecomposition of the carrion and insect succession patterns are influenced by \nmany factors e.g. geographic location, habitat, season, temperature, humidity, \ninsect abundance and carrion accessibility. Furthermore, many of these factors \nare inter-related and even the decomposition rate and insect succession are \ninter-dependent. It has been found that decomposition of the carrion is \naccelerated when the insects, particularly necrophagous flies, are present \n(Payne 1965; Abell et al. 1982). Braack (1986) found that arthropods were \ncapable of reducing a medium-sized Impala carcass to keratinous remains and \nbones within five days in summer and within 14 days in winter, without the aid of \nvertebrate scavengers. Simmons et al. (2010) found that body size is important \nfactor in decomposition rate only when carcasses are accessed by insects; the \nsmall carcasses are decomposed faster than large ones. However, in the case \nof insect absence, the decomposition of bodies becomes at the same rate \nwhatever they are indoors, submerged or buried. \nIn general climatic conditions, particularly temperatures, play an important role \nin the insect activity and carrion decomposition. Variations in climatic conditions \nlead to differences in the decomposition speed, insect development rate and \nsuccession pattern in different habitats, seasons and geographic locations \n(Anderson 2009). \nIn a dense urban setting in Chicago, Baumgartner (1988) reported increasing fly \ndiversity and abundance with the advance of warm weather. In contrast, \npersistent cold temperatures combined with other properties of high elevations \nin Colorado have a negative influence on the rabbit carcass decomposition and \ninsect succession as illustrated by the drastically reduced number of taxa, \nPage 12 of 124 \n \ndelayed loss of biomass, prolonged bloat and retarded larval development. \nEven in burial conditions, cold weather combined with type of soil effectively \ninhibited the decomposition process and accessibility of buried pig carcass to \ninsects (Turner and Wiltshire 1999). \nHigh humidity and rainfall could decrease the insect activity (Parman 1945) and \nlarval development (Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996) as well as affect the \nmicrobial activity within the carcass (Gill 2005). This in turn influences the rate \nof decomposition. Payne (1965) found that the reduction of carrion was slower \non cool, cloudy days. Differences in decomposition were seen in the fall \ncarcasses, probably due to greater rainfall (Tantawi et al. 1996). The length of \nbloated stage is more dependent on the abundance and larval development \nthan climatic conditions, particularly temperatures, as this stage is ended by the \npenetration of insect larvae into the body, resulting in the release of gases \n(Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996). Tantawi et al. (1996) found that in \nsummer, bloated stage lasted longer than in spring. They attributed this \nobservation to the differences in breeding biology of the primary flies colonizing \nthe rabbit carcasses in these seasons. \nMany studies have been conducted to study the carrion ecology and associated \narthropod fauna in different geographic locations and habitats: In mainland \nBritish Columbia, which has a typical coastal rainfall habitat, Dillon and \nAnderson (1995) compared the insect succession and decomposition speed of \nexposed pig carcasses in sun and shade and found higher temperatures and \nfaster decomposition in sun, but a greater diversity of successional insects in \nthe shade. In Manitoba, Canada, Gill (2005) reported no differences in the \narthropod community collected from sun- and shade-exposed pig carrion. In \ncontrary, in the Boreal forest region of Canada, pig carcasses situated in sun \nwere colonized by more abundance of dipteran species than those were placed \nin shade. Similarly, Isiche et al. (1992), in southern England, found a difference \nin the calliphorid species abundance and diversity when observing mouse \ncarrion in sunny and shaded habitats. Four species were recorded in the sunny \nareas and only two of these species were observed in the shaded areas. On the \nisland of Oahu, Hawaii, Goff (1991) recorded significant differences in the insect \ncolonization of remains indoor and outdoor situations. The peak of insect \ndiversity is reached faster indoors; however, at later stages, few indoor species \nPage 13 of 124 \n \ncontrast to a wide diversity of outdoor species. The indoor carcass fauna was \nricher in Diptera species while the outdoor fauna was characterized by a higher \nabundance of Coleoptera species. Goff also observed differences in insect \nsuccession in different areas of a rainforest habitat where distinct changes in \nspecies composition were observed (Early and Goff 1986; Tullis and Goff \n1987). Tessmer and Meek (1996) noted several differences in species \ncomposition of calliphorids on carrion placed in woodland versus pastureland \nhabitats. They found that a greater abundance of blowflies was associated with \nthe pasture habitat. \n1.6. Forensically important flies \nThere are about 86000 fly species described worldwide (Castner 2009). A fly \ncommunity in a given geographic comprises mainly synanthropic, myiasis-\ncausing and forensically important flies. The latter ones are those associated \nwith remains and provide evidence in the death investigations (Greenberg 1985; \nSmith 1986). Some fly species can be placed in more than one of these \nmentioned categories, such as Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina, Lucilia sericata, \nChrysomya albiceps and Calliphora vicina which can infest living tissue and \nbreed on carrions, feces or decaying matter. \nIn Arab countries including Kuwait, data on synanthropic and myiasis-causing \nflies are available in publications of some authors (e.g. B\u00fcttiker et al. 1979; Al-\nHouty 1989; Hira et al. 2004) who are interested in studying biodiversity and \necosystems or who are interested in recording myiasis cases. However, there is \na paucity of basic information on forensic flies as this field of study has \nunfortunately not received much attention. \nThere is great variability in the fly species involved in the sequential colonization \nof animal remains and their times of arrival with respect to geographic location \n(Early and Goff 1986; Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996; Archer and Elgar \n2003; Tabor et al. 2005). Each biogeographic zone has specific climatic, \nseasonal and developmental requirements of certain fly species. \nSo, the occurrence and abundance of forensic fly species differs among \ngeographic regions, and even among habitats in the same geographic area. For \nexample, in the Old World, species of genera Calliphora, Lucilia and Chrysomya \nPage 14 of 124 \n \nare considered the most important carrion colonizers (Smith 1986), whereas in \nthe New World, Phormia regina (Meigen 1826), Cochliomyia macellaria \n(Fabricius 1775) and species of Lucilia and Calliphora are important carrion \nbreeders (Hall 1948). Also, the habitat can influence the carrion fauna \ncomposition as blowflies exhibit preferences within their regional distribution \n(Erzin\u00e7lio\u00f7lu 1996). Phormia regina is prevalent in the urban environment in the \nNetherlands as they prefers shade rather than brightly sunlight; in urban areas \nshade is available in and around buildings (Huijbregts 2004; Haskell et al. \n2008). In another geographical location, in southwestern British Columbia, pig \ncarrion in open fields attracted only Phormia regina and L. illustris (Meigen \n1826) (Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996). The latter species frequents \ncorpses located in more rural wooded areas (Williams 2008). Calliphora vicina \nand L. sericata are commonly considered urban species (Reiter 1984 cited in \nAnderson 2009), but have collected in rural regions (Dillon and Anderson 1995; \nHaskell et al. 1997). Similarly, L. sericata, Bercaea Africa (Wiedemann 1824) \n(Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis Fall\u00e9n) and Chrysomya albiceps have been \ntrapped indoors and outdoors in Saudi Arabia (B\u00fcttiker et al. 1979). It is obvious \nthat a fly species could prefer and subsequently is abundant in a certain habitat \nbut  in  the  same  time  it  may  extend  its  range  to  another  habitat.  Therefore,  \ncaution must be used in determining location of death or whether remains have \nbeen moved based on insect evidence. \nWherever the geographic location, it has been accepted that the most \nsignificant and the first insect colonizers on carrion are typically species of \nnecrophagous flies in the families Calliphoridae (blowflies) and Sarcophagidae \n(flesh flies) (Greenberg 1991; Hall and Doisy 1993; Anderson and \nVanLaerhoven 1996; Tabor et al. 2004). But the species involved will vary \naccording to the biogeographic region. In most European countries including \nBritain, France and Germany, Calliphora vicina, Calliphora vomitoria (Linnaeus \n1758) and Lucilia sericata are common primary colonizers of corpses (Bourel et \nal. 1999; Schroeder et al. 2003; Gennard 2007). In contrast, Chrysomya \nalbiceps is the common first colonizer in Afro-tropical regions, oriental regions, \ncentral South America and Southern Europe (Baumgartner and Greenberg \n1984; Hall and Smith 1993). Whilst in another tropical region such as Hawaii, it \nhas been found that the initial colonizers are Lucilia cuprina, Chrysomya \nmegacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart 1843) in the family \nPage 15 of 124 \n \nCalliphoridae and Bercaea africa (Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis), \nParasarcophaga ruficornis, Sarcophagula (Sarcophaga) occidua (Fabricius) and \nHelicoba morionella (Aldrich) in family Sarcophagidae (Early and Goff 1986). \nBlowflies are attracted to the body immediately after death to feed and oviposit \n(Smith 1986; Dillon 1997; Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996). Sometimes, \noviposition is delayed when the death occurs at night. It is commonly thought \nthat flies are nocturnally inactive (Haskell et al. 1997).  Generally, some fly \nspecies such as Musca and Muscina spp. may visit the carrion to feed but not to \nbreed (Dear 1978; De Souza and Linhares 1997). Mostly, these 'secondary' \nflies are attracted by exudates rather than the carrion itself (Gennard 2007). \nKnowing the developmental data of the primary colonizers of the corpse and the \nmeteorological data at the crime scene, it is possible to estimate the PMI (Wells \nand LaMotte 2009). This is like a biological clock; it starts at the time of \noviposition (Greenberg 1991). However, if insect access is limited it complicates \nanalysis of specimens by the forensic entomologist (Catts 1992). Whether \naccess is denied by climatic conditions (Smith 1986), by burying the remains \n(Payne et al. 1968; Rodriguez and Bass 1985) or by any other factors \n(Anderson 2009). Flies that are attracted to a corpse are also influenced by their \nenvironment (Gennard 2007). \nLow temperatures (De Jong and Chadwick 1999; Shah and Sakhawat 2004) \nand heavy rain and humidity (Smith 1986) influence blowfly activity and delay \ntheir arrival at carrion. Greenberg (1990) has stated that calliphorids do not fly in \nthe rain. Similarly, Digby (1958) found that strong wind inhibited the ability of \nCalliphora vicina to fly. In contrast, sarcophagid flies are considered to be \nunimpeded by rain (Erzin\u00e7lio\u00f7lu 2000); as a result, flesh flies may be the initial \ncolonizers of the body if there is a long period of rainy weather. Temperatures \nabove 30\u00b0C and below 12\u00b0C are also known to inhibit blowfly activity (Gennard \n2007). Kuwait has a harsh environment; the climate is intensively hot and dry \nwith sandstorms, particularly in hot season when temperatures reach 50\u00baC. The \ninfluence of this environment on the fly activity and ecology needs to be \ninvestigated as it is important in the determination of the PMI. \nMany blowfly species are cosmopolitan and those which occur in Kuwait could \nbe found in other geographic regions. It is likely that, the same fly species, in \nPage 16 of 124 \n \ndifferent geographic locations, has different developmental requirements and \necological features which enable it to be adapted and thrive in such markedly \ndifferent environments. Anderson (2009) has stated that when a species is \nfound to be present in many different regions, it is possible that there may be \nwithin-species differences. However, if we suppose there is geographical \ndifferences between blowfly species, it is unknown if this is due to genetic \nvariations or simply a reflection of the behavioral response to different \nenvironmental conditions (Wells and LaMotte 2009). Using gas \nchromatography\/mass spectrometry, Byrne et al. (1995) identified the extracted \ncuticular hydrocarbons of 3 geographical populations of  Phormia regina and \nafter discriminant analysis of the cuticular hydrocarbons profiles, they could \nseparate the flies according to both location and gender. A morphological and \nmolecular analysis of Chrysomya bezziana from some countries in Africa and \nAsia revealed that there are two geographical races of this species, one from \nsub-Saharan Africa and the other from the Gulf region and Asia. The latter race \ncould be further divided into two lineages, i.e. one from mainland Asia (from Iraq \nto the Malay Peninsula) and the other from two islands of Papua New Guinea \n(Hall et al. 2001). \nDistribution range of Calliphoridae changes according to the season and \nclimatic conditions. It has been found that Phormia regina is the dominant \nspecies in the summer months in the northern USA, whilst being the dominant \nspecies in winter months in southern USA (Byrd and Allen 2001). This may also \nbe the case in Kuwait where flies may migrate from the desert to urban habitat \nor to agricultural areas in hot weather and sandstorms to seek for suitable \nmicrohabitats in other places to maximize their chances of survival. \nThere are many questions which need to be answered and a lot of data \nrequired to be gathered in order to apply insect evidence in legal investigations \nin Kuwait. This study provides baseline information on the forensically important \nflies and is the first step for more investigations in the ecology, biology and \nbehavior of these flies in this country. \n1.7. Use of insects in criminal investigations \nAlthough forensic entomology includes three categories (urban; stored-\nproducts; medico-legal), the third category, medico-legal forensic entomology, is \nPage 17 of 124 \n \nthe most popularized aspect of the science and more frequently used in legal \nmatters (Catts and Goff 1992). \nMedico-legal entomology deals with the use of insect or other arthropods \nassociated with a corpse at a murder scene in legal investigation to provide \ndata not available by using the normal methods of classic pathology (Wolff et al. \n2001). These data helps to solve litigation in criminal cases (Haskell et al. \n2008). \nForensic entomologists can provide an objective estimate of time since death as \nwell as other valuable information concerning the circumstances surrounding \nthe victim's demise including season of death, location of death, movement or \nstorage of remains after death, specific sites of injury on the body, postmortem \nartifacts on the body, use of drugs, and even more in linking a suspect to the \nscene of a crime, in child neglect and sexual molestation as well as in the \nidentification of suspects (Campobasso and Introna 2001). \nThe crime scene is usually the focal point of any criminal investigation. A death \nscene properly processed can yield information useful to reconstruct events and \ncircumstances, link a suspect to the victim or scene and establish the credibility \nof the statements made to investigators by witnesses (Meek and Andrew 2005). \nTherefore, the task of the entomologist starts at the crime scene to gather insect \nsamples and evidence with regards to the habitat type, corpse condition and \nmeteorological data. He\/she should contact other authorized personnel \nresponsible for the legal investigation such as police officers, technicians and \nmedical  examiners  for  additional  information  about  the  identity  of  the  victim,  \ncircumstances of the crime and verification of essential evidence (Haskell et al. \n2008). \nThe next step is in the laboratory where entomological, molecular and \ntoxicological analysis are performed on the insect samples to determine their \nspecies, life stage, age and if there is a drug or chemical in their tissues. The \nanalysis of the data collected from observations and notations at the crime \nscene and the results of the laboratory work combined with utilization of the \nbasic concept of insect systematics, ecology and biology, the entomologist may \nhelp to answer the question when, who and where the death occurred. It should \nPage 18 of 124 \n \nbe kept in mind that each case has its own set of circumstances and \npeculiarities that defy exact matching of events to some predetermined scenario \n(Haskell et al. 2008). \nNecrophagous flies are attracted to the carrion by the odour emanating from it. \nIn the case of the concealment or hiding of a corpse after homicide, its place \nmay be betrayed by numerous blowflies in the immediate vicinity of the site in \nwhich it is hidden. The case history described by Williams (2008) is an example \nof the help of entomology in this respect. The investigators could determine the \nsite of the remains of a murder victim which were reported thrown down an \nopen well on a farm in a rural area in south-central Indiana. The exact location \nof the well was unknown. During searching investigators could determine the \nsite of the well after seeing thousand flies were hovering above it. The remains \nwere at the bottom of the well covered by debris; they were in advanced stage \nof decay, but no insects had colonized them. Access to the body by the \nblowflies was prevented by the intervening material, but odors were still capable \nof attracting multitudes of insects. \nUsually the female flies prefer to oviposit or larviposit in moist sites of the body \nsuch as natural orifices. Therefore, any maggot concentrations at other sites on \nthe body reflect the presence of antemortem injuries. This is particularly so with \nbodies in the fresh or bloated stages or decay (Haskell et al. 1997; Williams \n2008). Antemortem injuries are bloody areas, more attractive to the female flies \nto oviposit. Rodriguez and Bass (1983) have stated that a corpse may be more \ndecomposed in the area of the body where there are injuries which result in \nexposure of blood and underlying tissue, thus providing access for carrion \nbacteria and insects. Careful examination of these sites could help to know the \ncause and manner of death. The wound may be the result of a knife stab or \nbullet. Extensive maggot activity in the chest and palms of hands, and less in \nthe face, was used to indicate stab and defense wounds in the death of a young \nwoman (Rodriguez and Bass 1983; Williams 2008). Also the presence of other \ntraumatic antemortem injuries such as bruises, contusions, abrasions and \nlacerations, which are target for flies, could indicate that a victim was subjected \nto physical abuse such as dragging, hitting or falling before death (Gunn 2006; \nHaskell et al. 2008). The cause and manner of death can be also known in \ncases of drug abuse or toxicity by determination of narcotics or toxins in the \nPage 19 of 124 \n \ntissues of feeding Instars on the severely decomposing human remains (Goff \nand Lord 1994; Goff and Lord 2009).  \nInsects can also be used as indicators in the cases of neglect and sexual abuse \nof elderly and children (Benecke 2009). Untreated wounds and traumatized and \nsoiled urogenital areas are predisposing factors for fly infestation (Haskell et al. \n2008). Also fecal material and urine attached to diapers and garments, due to \nneglect, are often as attractive to a fly species as a decomposing corpse. \nNeglect can not be automatically assumed if evidence of insect activity is found \nbecause eggs may be laid immediately after cleaning and in the case of flesh \nflies, because 1st instars are laid, maggots are instantly present (Gunn 2006). \nThe extent of neglect i.e. colonization interval (not the postmortem interval) \nmust be determined based on the temperature of the place and the species and \nage of insects found. Gherardi and Costantini (2004) described a case in which \nthe maggot-infested body of an elderly woman was discovered in the filthy flat \nshared with her daughter. This resulted in her daughter being charged initially \nwith concealment of a corpse although she claimed that she had given her \nmother  a  meal  the  previous  night.  An  autopsy  later  in  the  day  of  discovery  \ndemonstrated that body\u2019s temperature was 34.7\u00b0C, indicating that the women \nhad not been dead for long, and this was corroborated by finding only the early \nstages of postmortem decomposition. However, the presence of 3rd instar \nblowfly larvae and second instar flesh fly larvae on the skin and diapers \nindicated that the woman had not been kept clean for several days and the \ndaughter was subsequently charged with elderly neglect. \nThe presence of certain fly species associated with the victim may indicate \nneglect\/or abuse. This can be corroborated by estimation of the age of \nrecovered maggots to reveal the length of neglect (Gunn 2006). For example, \nthe presence of specific wound myiasis-causing flies such as Chrysomya \nbezziana, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel 1858) and Wohlfahrtia magnifica \n(Schiner)  leads  to  the  suggestion  that  the  wounds  were  not  clean  while  the  \nhelpless victim was alive. These flies themselves could be the cause of death, \nparticularly when sensitive organs are infested. Also the presence of Fannia \ncanicularis (Linnaeus) and Muscina stabulans (Fallen) associated with the crime \nscene or the corpse, particularly in the early postmortem stages call the \nattention that during life the sanitation and health care of the victim were poor. \nPage 20 of 124 \n \nThese fly species do not feed on the corpse itself but they are attracted to \nexcreta (Benecke and Lessig 2001; Frost et al. 2010). Benecke (2009) in a case \nhistory found the larvae of F. canicularis and Muscina stabulans with the adult \nof Dermestes lardarius (Linnaeus)  on  the  corpse  of  an  elderly  woman.  The  \npresence of only these fly species and intact skin and eyes give an indication \nthat the colonization occurred antemortem. Similarly, Lucilia sericata are \nattracted to odors, such as ammonia, resulting from urine or faecal \ncontamination (Gennard 2007). The oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya \nmegacephala, is equally attracted to feces and can lead to errors in estimates of \nthe postmortem interval in similar cases of neglect (Goff et al. 1991). \nEntomological tools may also be used to determine if the body has been moved \nfrom one locality to another, and may provide information about the site of death \nitself because of relatively defined diversity of insects that exist in specific \ngeographical area\/habitat (Anderson 2009). In a landmark case in Belgium, \nforensic entomologist observed five species of Staphylinids on the bones of a \ncorpse but the absence of other insect species in spite of favorable conditions \nsuggested that the murder was committed elsewhere (Leclercq et al. 1991 cited \nin Varatharajan and Sen 2000). \nAs mentioned above, forensic entomology is used in many aspects of death \ninvestigations to solve or to produce additional information on crimes and their \ncircumstances. However, the major contribution of the science is the estimation \nof the postmortem interval in human cases (Haskell et al. 2008; Wells and \nLaMotte 2009), and even in wildlife cases (Anderson 1999). \nIn very early stage of death (1-3 days), the PMI can be estimated by the \npathologist based on the biological and physical changes of a corpse. The \nentomological findings can corroborate the results of the pathologist. In the \nearly stages of decomposition blowfly eggs, and sometimes small larvae can be \nseen in the natural orifices or wounds of the body; it can be assumed that it has \nonly been on the site for a very short time (1-2 days) (Smith 1986). After 72 \nhours or more after death, the medical procedures are no longer of value \n(Campobasso and Introna 2001) and then the value of entomological tools \nbecome increasingly important in the PMI estimate. \nPage 21 of 124 \n \nInformation on the development and succession of carrion insect species is \nused in two primary ways to estimate the PMI of human remains (Tabor et al. \n2004). In cases where death was recent (from one day to more than one month) \nthe PMI can be estimated by analyzing the degree of development of early-\narrival species which have colonized the corpse (Smith 1986; Goff 1993; Wells \nand LaMotte 2009). The technique is heavily dependent on correct \nidentification, the accuracy of the estimated environmental conditions the \ninsects are thought to have experienced and the reliability of the reference \ndevelopment data (Gunn 2006). Data on the development of forensically \nimportant species are consulted from controlled studies (e.g. Kamal 1958; \nIntrona et al. 1989; Goodbrod and Goff 1990; Wells and Kurahashi 1994, \nGreenberg and Wells 1998; Byrd and Allen 2001). Based on the results of these \ncontrolled studies, the entomologists can estimate the time taken for the \ndevelopment of the stage of similar species collected on a corpse. \nAnother PMI-dependent process is the succession of arthropod species found \non and within a body (Schoenly and Reid 1987). As insects arrive at a corpse in \na predictable manner specific to the location and environmental conditions \nunder which the remains are found (Payne 1965; Anderson and VanLaerhoven \n1996; Anderson 2009), the time of death can be estimated using succession \ndata when insect development data  are unavailable (Tabor et al. 2004). In such \ncases,  the  composition  of  taxa  found  on  a  corpse  at  the  time  of  discovery  \n(corpse fauna) are usually compared with the composition of the arthropod \nassemblage at a given period of time derived from an animal model (base line \nfauna) to estimate the PMI (Schoenly et al. 1996). Succession data have been \nused to very accurately calculate a PMI as long as 52 days (Schoenly et al. \n1996) and could be applied to a much greater interval (Wells and LaMotte \n2009). \nThe two approaches for estimating the PMI are complementary (Tabor et al. \n2004). However, the investigator must decide which model is suitable to be \nused. The use of development data is most applicable in the early phase of \ndecomposition when the immature stage of the first colonizers of family \nCalliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and Muscidae are present. Whereas succession \ndata are used the earliest colonizers are no longer present and the remains are \nPage 22 of 124 \n \noccupied by predators of fly maggots such as beetles (Smith 1986; Schoenly \nand Reid 1987). \nIn a case study, Goff and Flynn (1991) estimated the PMI for the remains of a \nman using the succession pattern. The remains were removed from a sandy \narea near the ocean in Mokuleia, Oahu, Hawaii.  At examination, at the city and \nmorgue, the body was in dry stage of decomposition and the body cavities were \nmarkedly desiccated and decomposed. Specimens collected from the remains \nwere three families of Coleoptera (beetles) and four families of Diptera (true \nflies). In addition one family (Staphylinidae) isolated from the soil underneath \nthe remains at the crime scene. The collections were compared with \ncomputerized records of decomposition studies conducted in similar habitats on \nthe island of Oahu. These comparisons for taxa developmental stages resulted \nin a PMI estimate of 34-36 days, based on interpretations of pattern of \narthropod succession on the remains. This interval was primarily based on the \npresence of adult Philonthus longicornis (Stephens 1832) (Family \nStaphylinidae), mature larvae of Piophila casei (Linnaeus) (Family Piophilidae) \nand empty pupal cases of Chrysomya rufifaces (Family Calliphoridae). The \nperiod of postmortem interval (34-36 days) in this case fitted well with the last \nsighting of the decedent, 37 days period to discovery of the remains. \n1.8. Aim and objectives \nThe study was conducted to address six objectives:  \n(1)  To  discover  qualitative  and  quantitative  differences  in  the  Diptera  \nassemblages associated with rabbit carcasses at four locations in Kuwait.  \n(2) To compare the successional changes and rate of decomposition of rabbit \ncarcasses at the same four locations.  \n(3) To compare the necrophagous Diptera of rabbit carcasses with those from \nhuman corpses from criminal investigations.  \n(4) To provide baseline information on the forensically important flies and pave \nthe way for more research on their ecology, biology and behavior. \nPage 23 of 124 \n \n(5) To familiarize officials with the forensic applications of entomology, and \nstimulate the involvement of entomologists in the criminal investigation team \nand entomological tools in the protocols which are used. \n(6) The important objective of the study is eventually to advance forensic \nentomology and maximize the opportunity of entomologists to take part in \nthe court in Kuwait and other Arab countries. \nPage 24 of 124 \n \nChapter 2: MATERIAL AND METHODS \n2.1. Study sites \nThe study was conducted in November and December of 2009 at four sites \ndesignated A through D, in Kuwait. This period is the beginning of rainy season. \nThe study sites represented four different habitats (desert; urban; agriculture; \ncoastal). \nSite A (desert habitat) was an animal hutch within the campus of the Central \nVeterinary Laboratories in Amghara area. The campus is surrounded by \nexpansive sandy areas; the main road is about half km away and the nearest \nbuildings are about 4km from the site of the experiment. \nSite B (urban habitat) was the roof of the building of the General Department of \nthe Criminal Evidence in Farwaneya, which is a dense urban town. \nSite C (agriculture habitat) is an animal hutch within a cattle farm in Sulaibeya \narea which is the collection of dairy farms in Kuwait. Some parts of the farm are \ncultivated with fodder for animal feeding. \nSite D (coastal habitat) is an isolated place within the club of police officers, in \nAbo Al-Hasaneya area, which is situated on the Gulf coast. \nEach site was selected on the basis of specific criteria. It was necessary also \nthat the sites of the experiment were sufficiently isolated to minimize human \ninterferences and scavenger disturbances. \n2.2.  Experimental animals and cages \nIn total 40 mature rabbits weighing from 1.72 to 3.46Kg (2.44 \u00b1 0.44) were \npurchased locally and used in this study. The rabbits were of different colors but \ncomparable in size. They were euthanized with chloroform at the study sites. To \nexclude scavengers, the rabbits were placed in man-made fabric cages (55cm x \n40cm x 24cm), which were designed specifically to allow insect access, but \nprevent them escaping, instead trapping them in a chamber at the top of each \ncage. For these purposes, each cage was made of a frame composed of two \nlayers of wire screening (Fig. 1), the outer layer was a rigid steel 2cm mesh to \nkeep out scavengers and allow insects access. The inner layer was a lean \nPage 25 of 124 \n \nmesh cloth with slits small enough to prevent insects escaping. The top of the \ncage was covered with thin plywood which was opened in its middle for the \nfixation of a water bottle to act as a collection chamber. One side of the cage \nhad a hinged opening (20cm x 15cm) to allow placing and taking out of the \nrabbit carcass. Two holes (2cm) were made on two sides of the inner cloth to \nallow access for the insects to oviposit on the carcass, but on attempts to \nescape, they made their way to the bottle fixed on the top of the cage to be \ncollected (Fig. 2). \nFig. 1: Diagram shows the construction of a cage designed to protect the rabbit carcass from \nscavengers and trap the visiting insects. \nFig. 2: Diagram shows the placement of a cage and sticky trap in a site. \n26cm \nWood  \n24cm  \n40cm  \n55cm \nWired cage, wood on \nthe base & black mesh \nfabric inside adjusted in \nthe corners  \n\u00bdm \n1m  \nRope  \n2 sided  \n Sticky trap \n50cm \nTransparent \nWater bottle \nPage 26 of 124 \n \n \n2.3. Experimental design and sampling \nThe experiment lasted from 16-30 November 2009 at site A, and from 10-26 \nDecember at the other sites. It was not applicable to bring and examine in the \nlab more than four rabbits per day. Therefore, sampling at site A was done \nseparately. Ten rabbits were used in each site (habitat) where they were killed, \nweighed and placed in the cages. Then, the caged carcasses were divided into \ntwo groups (a; b) which were distributed 10m apart in two lines. The distance \nbetween any two carcasses in the same group was 2m. A sticky trap was \npositioned half a meter from each caged carcass (Fig. 2 and 3). The cages \nwere labeled with plastic coated ID cards. These cards stated specific letters for \nsites and groups, and numbers for carcasses; for example, the ID (such as Aa1) \nrepresented the site A, the group a, and the carcass number 1. The ID cards \nwere with different colors, each color represented a site of the experiment. The \nsticky traps were labeled with the same ID as the corresponding cage. The date \nof death was designated as day 0. Each site was visited after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 \ndays for sampling the carcasses (Fig. 4). A pilot study had been carried out to \narrive at this sampling strategy. At each visit, two caged carcasses, one from \neach group, with the corresponding sticky traps were removed and placed in \nlarge plastic bags which were closed and transferred to the laboratory for \nentomological examinations. \nThe protocol of placement and sampling of carcasses is shown in (Fig. 3 and \nTable 1). For example the rabbit carcasses sampled after two days from \nplacement at site A was designated A2. Such a protocol allowed sampling of \ntwo carcasses at specific date without any disturbance of other carcasses which \nwere removed later according to the schedule. In addition, this sampling design \nallowed collection of information on necrophagous fly succession and their \ncomposition on the rabbit carcasses at different stages of decomposition and at \ndifferent habitats. \n \n \nPage 27 of 124 \n \n \nSite A: Desert habitat \n The Central Veterinary Laboratories - Amghara area \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Diagram shows the distribution of the cages and sticky traps and sampling time during \nthe experiment at site A. \n \n10m \n10m \n2m 2m \n10m \n2m 2m \n10m \n2m 2m \nAb8 \nAa1 \nAa3  \nAa5 \nAa7 \nAa9 \nAb2 \nAb4 \nAb6 \nAb10 \n10m \n2m 2m \nSampling \nDay14 \nSampling \nDay7 \nSampling \nDay4 \nSampling \nDay2 \nSampling \nDay10 \nD\nat\na \nlo\ngg\ner\n \nRo\n\u00bd \n1 \nSticky \ntrap \nPage 28 of 124 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4: ID cards with different colors representing different sites of the experiment. \nSite B \nUrban \nSite C \nAgriculture\nSite D \nCostal \nSite A \nDesert \nPage 29 of 124 \n \nTable 1: The study sites and the sampling days \nDate Site Habitat: Area (Location) Sampling A  Sampling B Sampling C Sampling D \n16-Nov SITE A Desert: Amghara (Veterinary Laboratories) A0=Placement of \ncarcasses       \n17-Nov             \n18-Nov     A2*=(Aa9+Ab10)       \n19-Nov             \n20-Nov     A4=(Aa7+Ab8)       \n21-Nov             \n22-Nov             \n23-Nov     A7=(Aa5+Ab6)       \n24-Nov             \n25-Nov             \n26-Nov     A10=(Aa3+Ab4)       \n27-Nov             \n28-Nov             \n29-Nov             \n30-Nov     A14=(Aa1+Ab2)       \n             \n10-Dec SITE C Agriculture: Sulaibeya (Cattle Farm)     C0=Placement of carcasses   \n11-Dec SITE D Costal: Abo Al-Hasaneya (Police officers Club)       D0=Placement of \ncarcasses \n12-Dec SITE B Urban: Farwaneya (General Department of Criminal Evidence)   B0=Placement of \ncarcasses C2=(Ca9+Cb10)   \n13-Dec           D2=(Da9+Db10) \n14-Dec       B2=(Ba9+Bb10) C4=(Ca7+Cb8)   \n15-Dec           D4=(Da7+Db8) \n16-Dec       B4=(Ba7+Bb8)     \n17-Dec         C7=(Ca5+Cb6)   \n18-Dec           D7=(Da5+Db6) \n19-Dec       B7=(Ba5+Bb6)     \n20-Dec         C10=(Ca3+Cb4)   \n21-Dec           D10=(Da3+Db4) \n22-Dec       B10=(Ba3+Bb4)     \n23-Dec             \n24-Dec         C14=(Ca1+Cb2)   \n25-Dec           D14=(Da1+Db2) \n26-Dec       B14=(Ba1+Bb2)     \n* A2 = Sampling at site A on 2nd day \nPage 30 of 124 \n \n \n2.4. Laboratory work \nIn the laboratory, the bags were opened to take out the cages and sticky traps. \nThe  carcasses  were  removed  from  the  cages  carefully  and  weighed  with  a  \nspring balance. Then they were dissected and examined for insects. The stage \nof decomposition, sites of colonization and insect developmental stages on \ncarcasses were noted. Immature stages (eggs; 1st and  2nd instars) were \ncollected and reared on 15g minced beef in plastic pots, covered with gauze. \nDaily, they were observed and moistened with water. When the 3rd instars \nreached full maturation, 15 larvae were placed in a bigger pot with sawdust and \ncovered with gauze. The vials for rearing and pupation were placed in an air-\nconditioned room with controlled temperature in the laboratory. In addition, \nsamples of each life stages were reared or pupated in the backyard of the \nlaboratory (on the open) under ambient temperature and relative humidity. For \nidentification samples of 3rd instars were placed in 70% ethanol after killing in \nboiling water. Larvae were identified to species or genus level to determine the \nabundance of different fly taxa in the samples. In addition, samples of each life \nstage present on the carcasses were collected and preserved in 70% ethanol. \nEgg masses, 1st and 2nd instars were collected using a paint brush, whereas 3rd \ninstars and pupae were collected using entomological forceps. It should be \nnoted that the portion collected from each life stage was representative to its \nrelative abundance on the carcass. All adult flies attached to the sticky traps or \ntrapped in the bottles (collection chambers) were removed carefully, and placed \nin vials for identification and counting. Live flies were killed using chloroform or \nrefrigeration. The vials containing the preserved or pinned larvae or adult flies \nwere labeled with the same ID of the cage or sticky trap from which they were \ncollected. During rearing, the development of larvae or emergence of adult flies \nwas noted in every day of observations. \nThe flies were identified using dichotomous and pictorial taxonomic keys by \n(James 1947; Zumpt 1965; Bei-Bienko 1988; Pont 1991; Erzin\u00e7lio\u00f7lu 1996; \nSpradbery 2002; Watson and Dallwitz 2003; Scudder and Cannings 2006; \nKrzysz 2010). For confirmation, some adult fly samples were sent to the school \nof Forensic and Investigative Sciences, University of Central Lancashire \n(UCLan), UK, for identification using molecular analysis. In addition, personal \ncommunication was made with Dr. M. Hall and N. Wyatt in the British Natural \nPage 31 of 124 \n \nHistory Museum (NHM) for consultation on identification of Sarcophagids and \nthe other tiny flies as well as with Szpila K. for identification of Calliphoridae. \n A photographic documentation using Dino-Eye USB (Digital Eyepiece\/Camera \nadapter for microscope, model AM423) and Dino-Light (Digital \nMicroscope\/Camera, model Pro2 AD-413T) and video recording of all \nprocedures of the experiment at the study sites and in the laboratory were \nmade.  \n2.5.  Environmental data \nSince insect activity and carrion decomposition are influenced by temperature \nand relative humidity, continuously operating dataloggers (Lascar model EL-\nUSB-2) were programmed to record the ambient temperatures and relative \nhumidity every hour during the experimental duration at each study sites \n(habitats). Data loggers were attached to an upright post one meter above the \nground in the middle of the study site. In sites B and D where the carcasses \nwere placed in the open, the dataloggers were enclosed in a waterproof cover \nto prevent exposure to direct sunlight and rain. Daily mean temperatures and \nrelative humidity were calculated from hourly datalogger recordings. In addition, \nweather records were obtained from the weather stations of the Directorate \nGeneral of Civil Aviation located near the study sites. \n2.6.  Real case study \nThe main objective of this study was to collect information on the necrophagous \nDiptera colonizing human corpses to be compared with those from rabbit \ncarcasses; the postmortem intervals of the cases were recorded from the \nmedical and\/or police reports, when the killer confessed or the victim was \nreported missing. \nThe study was conducted, after the agreement of the high authority of the \nMinistry of Interior, through the General Department of Criminal Evidence during \ninvestigations in cases of homicide, suicide, accident or unattended death. The \nmaterial of the present study comprised 13 cases where human dead were \nlocated in different regions and habitats of Kuwait. \nPage 32 of 124 \n \nThe crime scenes were visited to collect insect samples and data including the \ndate of body discovery, types of habitat, sites of insect colonization on the body, \nstages of insect development, stages of decomposition, causes of death, \ncircumstances of victims (nationality; sex;  age; clothed; concealed; burned) and \nreal intervals (when a victim was last seen alive or reported missing). In some \ninstances, crime scenes were visited after the removal of corpses which then \nwere examined at autopsy. Moreover, information were obtained from the \nmedical and police reports. Climatic data were obtained from the stations of the \nDirectorate general of Civil Aviation located near the crime scenes. The human \nremains and crime scene were photographed. \nSamples of insects were collected on, around or under the corpses in the crime \nscene and\/or at autopsy. The samples were representative to the relative \nabundance of each life stage and sites of colonization on the corpses. The \nmethods of collection, preservation, identification and rearing of insect at all \ndevelopmental stages were done as described for the samples from rabbit \ncarcasses. \n2.7.  Statistical analysis \nThe decomposition rates of the carcasses at the four different locations were \ncompared using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance). Successional data were \nsummarized in kite diagrams, traditional in forensic entomology. \nDifferences in species at the locations (both qualitative and quantitative) were \ninvestigated using correspondence analysis which is an ordination technique. \nStatistical significant differences between groups were tested using ANOSIM \n(analysis of similarity; PAST version 1.94 b, Hammer et al., 2001).  \nPAST is a comprehensive statistics package that is used not only by \npaleontologists, but also in many fields of life science, earth science, and even \nengineering and economics. It has a spreadsheet-like user interface where data \nare easily entered and analyzed.  \nA mixed effects Poisson model was used on rounded, logged data with species \nas the random effect. This was sensible as it takes into account the large \nPage 33 of 124 \n \nnumber of zeros, as well as down-scaling the effects of abundant species. The \nanalysis allowed comparisons of the decomposition stages. \nPage 34 of 124 \n \nChapter 3: RESULTS \n3.1. Necrophagous fly assemblages on decaying rabbit carcasses \nEleven families of necrophagous flies were collected at four sites (habitats) in \nthis study.

Similarly, \nfamilies Carnidae and Periscelididae were restricted to the coastal habitat. \nFamilies Ephydridae and Sphaeroceridae are most abundant in agriculture \nhabitat and family Muscidae was abundant in all habitats (Fig. 5). \nChrysomya albiceps from family Calliphoridae, P. ruficornis from family \nSarcophagidae and Musca domestica from family Muscidae were the most \nabundant species on rabbit carcasses and representative in all habitats. \nIn addition to Diptera (flies), many other arthropods were reported in this study; \nhowever, they were identified only to the taxon \u2018order\u2019. These arthropods \nincluded beetles and ants which are of forensic importance (Table 3). \nUsing analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) there was a significant difference in the \ndiversity of fly species between different habitats (R=0.1761 and p=0.003). Also \nusing the analysis to compare between pairs of habitats (0.05\/n as the new \nsignificance threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e. 0.05\/6 = 0.0083) \nindicates the greatest difference was between desert and agricultural habitats \n(R=0.468 and p=0.001), where as urban and coastal habitats were similar in \nterms of the insects found on rabbit carcasses (R=0.031 and p=0.5833) (Table \n4). \n \n \nPage 37 of 124 \n \n* \n*  \nDesert\nUrban\nAgriculture\nCoastal\nC.vicina\nC.albiceps\nC.megacephala\nL.sericata\nFanniidae\nMuscidae\nPhoridae\nPeriscelididae\nPschodidae\nSarcophagidae\nUlidiidae\nSphaer ceridaeEphydridae\nCa nidae\n-2 -1.6 -1.2 -0.8 -0.4 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\nAxis 1\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nA\nxi\ns \n2\n \nFig. 5: Ordination of first two axes of correspondence analysis (based on presence\/absence) showing relative similarities of fly \nspecies (and families) and habitats  \n* Periscelididae \nCarnidae \n* Sphaeroceridae \nPsychodidae   \nPage 38 of 124 \n \nTable 4:  Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) pairwise comparisons of species diversity \nacross the four habitats: p values (R values) \nSITE Site A Site B Site C Site D \nHabitat Desert Urban Agriculture Coastal \nSite A   0.0218 (0.142) \n0.0001 \n(0.468) \n0.006 \n(0.2058) Desert \nSite B 0.0218 \n(0.142)   \n0.0029 \n(0.2154) \n0.5833  \n(-0.031) Urban \nSite C 0.0001 \n(0.468) \n0.0029 \n(0.2154)   \n0.0035 \n(0.222) Agriculture \nSite D 0.006 \n(0.2058) \n0.5833  \n(-0.031) \n0.0035 \n(0.222) \n  \nCoastal   \n \n \n3.2. Decomposition stages and fly activity \nFour stages of decomposition were observed, namely fresh (1-2 days), bloated \n(3-7 days), decay (8-14 days) and dry (10-14 days) (Table 5; Fig 6). Decay and \ndry stages were the most dissimilar followed by bloated and dry (Table 6).  \nIn the fresh stage, the arrival of flies at the carcasses differed according to the \nsite (habitat). At site A (desert habitat), Calliphora vicina, Chrysomya albiceps, \nL. sericata, sarcophagid flies (mainly P. ruficornis) were the first colonizers to \nbreed on the rabbit carcasses, whereas at site C (agriculture habitat), the first \ncolonizer was P. ruficornis to breed; Chrysomya albiceps was collected only in \nadult stage. \nIn the bloated stage, Chrysomya albiceps and sarcophagid flies (mainly P. \nruficornis) were abundant as adults and immatures in the four habitats. Only at \nsite C (agricultural habitat) was Calliphora vicina observed in adult and \nimmature stages. \nIn the decay stage, when a strong odor was noted, the abundance of the carrion \nbreeders from family Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae increased in nearly all \nsites. Even the flies colonizing the carcass to feed increased in number as well. \nOnly one rabbit reached dryness at site B. In dry stage, when the odor \ndisappeared and the nutrient matter became very little, all the flies left the \ncarcasses at all sites except at site B where adult muscid, sarcophagid and \nChrysomya albiceps adult flies were collected. In addition, prepupal stage of \nChrysomya albiceps was found in this site. \nPage 39 of 124 \n \n Table 5: Diptera succession on rabbit carcasses \nDecomposition stage \nFamily Species Fresh Bloat Decay Dry \nCalliphoridae \nCalliphora vicina 108 250 1682  \nCalliphoridae \nChrysomya albiceps 70  2316 8650 320 \nCalliphoridae \nChrysomya megacephala  2 31  \nCalliphoridae \nLucilia sericata 9  32   \nCarnidae \nHemeromyia sp. 1 4 1  \nEphydridae  27 246  \nFanniidae \nFannia canicularis 1  1  \nMuscidae \nMusca domestica, Musca sorbens, Musca spp., Stomoxys sp. 315 1535  2780 988 \nPeriscelididae \n Periscelis sp.   6  \nPhoridae \nMegaselia scalaris 1  3  1  \nPsychodidae \nPsychoda alternata   1  \nSarcophagidae \nParasarcophaga ruficornis, Sarcophaga africa, Sarcophaga spp., \nWohlfahrtia nuba \n125 1493 1738 3 \nSphaeroceridae 129 247 10   \nUlidiidae  \nPhysiphora alceae 1  11 50   \nPage 40 of 124 \n \nDecomposition stage \nFamily  \nSpecies \nFresh Bloat Decay Dry  \nCalliphoridae \nCalliphora vicina \n    \nCalliphoridae \nChrysomya albiceps     \nCalliphoridae \nChrysomya megacephala     \nCalliphoridae \nLucilia sericata     \nCarnidae \nHemeromyia sp.     \nEphydridae     \nFanniidae \nFannia canicularis     \nMuscidae \nMusca domestica, Musca sorbens, Musca spp., \nMuscina sp., Stomoxys sp.  \n    \nPeriscelididae \n Periscelis sp.     \nPhoridae \nMegaselia sp.     \nPsychodidae \nPsychoda sp.     \nSarcophagidae \nP. ruficornis, S.

Some carcasses were found to be \nwithout any insect colonization even after sufficient time had elapsed since \ndeath. The decomposition of these carcasses was delayed. Mainly, within two \ndays, when the carcasses were in fresh stage, eggs or small larvae of the \nspecies of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae were found colonizing most of \nthem. However, few carcasses, after four days were not shown any colonization \nof insects; even these carcasses were still in the fresh stage. \nIt was observed that the carcasses did not go through the stages of \ndecomposition at the same rate; there were few exceptions for example, at site \nA, a carcass was still in fresh stage after 10 days from death. At examination, \neggs and small larvae were found on its ears, neck, mouth and eyes. Similarly, \nthe decomposition rate of two rabbit carcasses were delayed at both sites C \nand D. These carcasses were in bloated stage after seven days from the death. \nThey were found to be colonized with 1st and 2nd instars of the sarcophagid sp. \n3.3. Decomposition rates of rabbit carcasses \nThe decomposition rates of the carcasses at the four habitats were compared \nusing ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), weight loss was used as a percentage \nof starting weight (the response variable), habitat type-4 levels; urban, desert, \nagricultural, coastal (a category explanatory variable). The results of the \nstatistical analysis revealed that the decomposition rate of carcasses at the \nurban habitat was different from those at other habitats, which were similar. \nTable 6:  Pairwise comparison of the decomposition stages of rabbit carcasses using \u201cmixed \neffects poisson model\"  \nDecomposition \nstage Dry Decay Bloat \nFresh  0.0139 0.0109 0.166 \nBloat 0.0003 0.2280 - \nDecay  <0.0001 - - \nDecay and dry are the most dissimilar followed by bloat and dry \nPage 42 of 124 \n \nSimplifying the analysis, we combine desert, agriculture and coastal since they \nare not significantly different. This tells us that there are differences in both the \nslope (t=4.005, p=0.0003) and intercept (t=2.395, p=0.022). The equations of \nthe lines are: \nUrban: % weight loss = -16.52 + 4.28 x day \nOthers: % weight loss = -0.16 + 1.10 x day \nThus decomposition appears to occur nearly four times faster in urban areas \ncompared to other areas (Fig. 6, Table 7). \nIt is noted that the heavier rabbit carcasses were decomposed slower than \nlighter carcasses. i.e. the percentage of body weight loss is less in heavier \ncarcasses than in lighter carcasses. In general, most carcasses dropped in \nweight as the decomposition advanced; however, in few cases, three carcasses \nin the fresh stage and two in the bloated stage increased little in weight then \nthey decreased in the following advanced stage of decomposition. \nPage 43 of 124 \n \nFig. 7: Decomposition rate of rabbit carcasses at different habitats \nTable 7: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the decomposition rates of rabbit carcasses at \ndifferent habitats \nSlope Site B Site A Site C Site D \nIntercept Urban Desert Agriculture Coastal \nSite B   0.009* 0.001* 0.002* \nUrban \nSite A 0.049*   0.409 0.467 \nDesert \nSite C 0.077 0.774   0.951 \nAgriculture \nSite D 0.046* 0.911 0.696   \nCoastal \n* * Decomposition  rate was significantly faster in the urban habitat  \n \nW\nei\ngh\nt l\nos\ns \n%\n \nDays of decomposition  \nPage 44 of 124 \n \n3.4. Case studies \nDuring the period of November 2008 to February 2010, 13 dead bodies were \nstudied to collect data on the circumstances of death, identify of victims and \ndecomposition stages as well as to collect insect samples in the crime scenes \nor at autopsy. \nTable 8 showed the information on the cases studied. Of the 13 cases 10 were \nmale and 3 females; their ages ranged from few days (newborn) to 53 years. \nFive  cases  were  Indians,  two  Kuwaitis,  one  Pakistani,  one  Saudi,  one  from  \nCongo and one from Nepal; two cases were not identified.  \nThe cause of death was homicide in three cases, suicide in two cases, natural \ndeath in two cases, and drug abuse, toxicity and abortion in one case for each. \nConcerning decomposition stages, one case was in fresh, six in bloated, one in \ndecay and five in dry stages. All cases were clothed, except three, two of which \nwere unclothed and one partially clothed. The cases were discovered several \ndays or several weeks after death, probably the emanating odor called the \nattention to notify the police. All cases were in an urban habitat, except two \ncases where one was in an agricultural habitat and one in a desert habitat. The \ncase in the desert was in dry stage and colonised by beetles; no necrophagous \nflies were recovered on the remains. In case No.3, the killer had divided the \nvictim into many parts and thrown them in plastic bags in different areas. He \nburned the head and the hands to hide the evidence. The hands were found in \nthe ground floor of an abundant building in Farwaneya after four days of death. \nThe eggs of Calliphora vicina were collected from the two hands. After two days \nthe head and trunk were found in a ditch in an urban area in Showaikh. The \nburned head was colonized by larvae of necrophagous flies, but no insects \nwere found on trunk which was placed in tightly closed bags. The legs were \nthrown in the roof of an electric transformer in Farwaneya. They were colonized \nwith Chrysomya albiceps and Sarcophaga sp. In case No.10, the feeding \nmaggots on the remains were submitted to the toxicology and chemical analysis \nlaboratory, the General Department of Criminal Evidence, to be tested for \nchemicals  and  toxins.  Three  chemicals  were  detected  in  their  tissues:  Butyl  \nhydroxyl toluene which was used in manufacture of medicine, Petroleum \nproducts and cosmetics, and phosphoric acid and Diethyl phtalate which were \nPage 45 of 124 \n \nused in manufacture of medicine and pesticide. The medical report of this case \nstated that the death was natural. \n \n \nPage 46 of 124 \n \nTable 8: Data collected on victim identity, death scene, decomposition stage, cause of death and insects recovered from 13 human cases \nCase \nNo. Date Area Death scene Sex \nAge \n(Yrs) Clothing Nationality \nDecomposition \nstage Cause of death Insect Insect stage Species identified  PMI (days) \n1 11\/10\/2008 Jeleeb Al-\nShoyoukh \nInside unusable bus Male - Clothed - Mummified dry - Diptera Pupa case Not i denti fied beyond or der  _ \nAdult Chrysomya al biceps  \nMusca domestica \nPhysiphor a alceae \nColeoptera Pupa; Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der \n2 12\/1\/2008 Jahra Agriculture open area \nwith dense trees; the \ncorpse was found \nhanging from a tree \nMale 53 Clothed Indian Dry Suicide Diptera Adult Calliphor a vicina  _ \nChrysomya megacephala \nChrysomya al biceps  \nMusca domestica  \nPsychoda alter nata  \nSarcophaga spp.  \nColeoptera Larvae Not i denti fied beyond order \n3 3\/25\/2009 Farwaneya The body was divided \ninto parts which were \nplaced in plastic bags \nand thrown in different \nareas: in two districts \nFemale 33 Clothed Pakistani Bloated Homicide Diptera Eggs Calliphor a vicina  4 \n3\/27\/2009 Showaikh \nindustrial \narea \nDiptera Larvae Calliphor a vicina  \nChrysomya al biceps  \nSarcophaga africa  \nPar asarcophaga r uficornis   \nWohlfahrtia nuba \nColeoptera Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der \n3\/27\/2009 Farwaneya Diptera Larvae Chrysomya al biceps  \nSarcophaga spp.  \n4 4\/6\/2009 Khaitan Urban, abandoned \nbuilding \nMale 39 Clothed Indian Decay Suicide Diptera Larvae; Pupa Chrysomya al biceps  14 \nSarcophaga spp.  \nColeoptera Larvae; Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der \n5 4\/13\/2009 Rowdah Urban building Male 40 Clothed Kuwaiti Decay Drug abuse Diptera Larvae Par asarcophaga r uficornis  8.5 \nChrysomya Albiceps  \n6 5\/8\/2009 Kabd Desert open area Male 45 Clothed Kuwaiti Dry  - Coleoptera Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der 21 \n7 6\/13\/2009 Salmeya Urban building Female 33 Clothed Indian Decay Homicide Diptera Larvae Calliphor a vicina Several days \nChrysomya al biceps  \nMegaselia scal aris  \nMusca domestica  \nPsychoda alter nata  \nSarcophaga spp.  \nPupa case Not i denti fied beyond or der \nColeoptera Larvae Not i denti fied beyond or der    \n8 8\/24\/2009 Jabreya Urban open area Male 40 Clothed - Bloated Pesticide toxicity Diptera Adult Chrysomya al biceps  _ \nMusca spp.  \nMusca domestica  \nColeoptera Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der \n9 9\/9\/2009 Khaldeya Femal e bathr oom in police \nstati on \nMale Few days Unclothed Nepal Bloated Bor n dead or l ef t without \ncare after born \nDiptera Larvae Sarcophaga spp.  Several days \n10 11\/6\/2009 Mahboula Urban building Male 51 Partially \nclothed \nIndian Bloated Natural death Diptera Larvae Chrysomya al biceps  Several days \nSarcophaga spp.  \n11 12\/30\/2009 Salmeya Urban building Male 58 Clothed Saudi Dry Natural death Diptera Pupa case Not i denti fied beyond or der _ \nAdult Chrysomya al biceps  \nColeoptera Larvae; Adult Not i denti fied beyond or der \n12 1\/13\/2010 Jeleeb Al-\nShoyoukh \nUrban building Male 58 Clothed Congo Bloated - Diptera Egg: rearing failed Not i denti fied beyond or der _ \nLarvae Chrysomya al biceps  \nChrysomya megacephala \nSarcophaga spp.  \n13 2\/21\/2010 Jeleeb Al-\nShoyoukh \nUrban building Female 30 Unclothed Indian Fresh  Homicide Diptera Larvae Calliphor a vicina _ \nChrysomya al biceps  \nMegaselia scal aris  \nSarcophaga spp.  \nAdult Calliphor a vicina  \nChrysomya al biceps  \nMegaselia scal aris  \nPar asarcophaga r uficornis    \nPage 47 of 124 \n \nThe insect community recovered on the remains was composed of orders \nDiptera and Coleoptera. Families Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and Muscidae \nwere the most encountered; three species from family Calliphoridae \n(Chrysomya albiceps, Calliphora vicina, Chrysomya megacephala), four species \nof family Sarcophagidae (P. ruficornis, S. africa, W. nuba and unidentified \nspecies), and two species of family Muscidae (M. domestica and unidentified \nspecies of Musca) were identified. Physiphora alceae, Psychoda alternata and \nMegaselia scalaris were collected less frequently. \nIt was noted that each stage of decomposition was associated with a certain \ndevelopmental stage of necrophagous flies on the corpses. This means that \nthere was chronological insect succession on the dead bodies. Case No.13, the \nslaughtered female victim, whose body was in fresh stage of decomposition, \nwas colonized with 1st and  2nd instars of different species of flies on the cut \nwound on the neck. On bloated bodies (cases No.3, 8, 9, 10, 12) adults and\/or \nimmatures of flies were observed. Of these cases, two (No.3, 8), which were \ndiscovered in open areas, were colonized with beetles in addition to flies. The \ncorpses in the decay stage were occupied with all developmental stages of flies \nincluding pupae. In this stage beetles started to appear. The dry stage \ncharacterized by occurrence of empty pupae and beetles, and disappearance of \nall other immature stage of flies. Adult flies were also observed on the remains. \n3.5. Comparison between fly colonization on rabbit carcasses and human \ncorpses \nIn comparing the insect colonization on the human corpses and rabbit \ncarcasses, it was noted that all species of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, the \nmost forensically important flies, were found on both; except L. sericata which \nwas not collected from the dead bodies. In general, the fly species richness was \ngreater in rabbit carcasses than human corpses, as  species of families \nCarnidae, Ephydridae and Fanniidae as well as Musca sorbans Wiedemann \n1830 and Stomoxys sp. were not recorded on human bodies; however, these \nspecies are less forensically important. Although Megaselia scalaris and \nPsychoda alternata were found on both human and rabbit carrion, they bred \nonly on the former; only adult stages of these flies were collected from rabbit \ncarcasses. The insect succession pattern was comparable in both of them. On \nPage 48 of 124 \n \nhuman bodies, which were in bloated and decay stages, large numbers of flies \nwere observed with increasing putrefactive odors, whereas few flies were found \non corpses which were in fresh and dry stages. The same trend was observed \nin rabbit carcasses. In the dry stage, adult flies visited both carrions but without \nbreeding.  Only, adult flies and beetles were found on the human bodies, which \nwere in dry stage.

Beetles and other arthropods were not \nidentified in spite of their occurrence on the studied carrions. The results of this \nstudy provide additional information to forensic entomologists by identifying fly \nspecies that are associated with carrion in Kuwait where no investigations on \nforensic entomology have been conducted before. \nIn  this  study  it  was  found  that  the  most  important  forensic  flies  belonged  to  \nfamilies Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae as the species of these families were \nabundant on both rabbit carcasses and human corpses and they were the first \ncolonizers to breed. This finding is consistent with the results of other studies in \ndifferent geographic areas (Payne et al. 1968; Smith 1986; Anderson and \nVanLaerhoven 1996; Hall 2001). But the species involved in this study differ \nfrom other studies in other habitats and geographic areas. \nFour species from each family Calliphoridae and family Sarcophagidae were \ncollected on carrion during this study. Of these the most frequent and abundant \nspecies were Chrysomya albiceps and P. ruficornis. In most European countries \nCalliphora vicina, Calliphora vomitoria and L. sericata are common primary \ncolonizers of corpses (Bourel et al. 1999; Schroeder et al. 2003; Gennard \n2007). In Hawaii, the tropical region of USA, it has been found that the initial \ncolonizers are L. cuprina, Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifaces in \nthe family Calliphoridae and S. africa and P. ruficornis, Sarcophagula \n(Sarcophaga) occidua and Helicoba morionella in the family Sarcophagidae \n(Early and Goff, 1986). Whereas, in another habitat in USA, at high altitudes in \nColorado, where temperatures are low, the most important primary colonizers \nare Phormia regina, Protophormia terraenovae (Robineau-Desvoidy 1830) , L. \nsericata and Calliphora lilaea (Walker, 1849) (De Jong and Chadwick 1999). \nChrysomya albiceps is a common first colonizer in Afrotropical regions, Oriental \nregions, Central South America and Southern Europe (Baumgartner and \nGreenberg 1984; Hall and Smith 1993). However, in some countries in Oriental \nand Australian regions, Chrysomya megacephala is widely distributed \nPage 52 of 124 \n \n(Aggarwal 2005). This fly species is the primary colonizer of human remains in \nMalaysia (Cheong et al. 1973; Salleh et al. 2007). In addition, Linhares (1981) \nconsiders it well known for its eusynanthropic and endophilic habitats in the \nNew World being found in large numbers in urban areas. In contrast, in this \nstudy, Chrysomya megacephala is less important and a secondary colonizer; it \nwas recorded only at desert and coastal locations in this study, in later stage of \ndecomposition of rabbit carcasses. These observations were also found in other \ngeographic areas; in southeastern Brazil, De Souza and Linhares (1997) have \nclaimed that this calliphorid species is not primarily a carrion fly, for it bred in \nrelatively small numbers.  \nSpecies of family Calliphoridae, particularly Chrysomya albiceps, were \nresponsible for maximum rabbit carcass consumption although Sarcophagid \nspecies coexisted with them in the same carcasses. Early and Goff (1986) have \nstated that species of sarcophagid are frequently observed larvipositing on \ncarrion at approximately the same time at the calliphorid species. This study \nconfirms this observation; however, the numbers of sarcophagid maggots were \nmuch less than those of Calliphoridae. Thus they rank second regarding the \nreduction of carrion weight. The larvipositing sarcophagid female has much less \nfecundity than the ovipositting calliphorid female (Hanski 1987, Goff 1991). \nChrysomya albiceps is an aggressive predator feeding on other dipterous larvae \npresent on carrions as well as decomposing tissues (Tantawi et al. 1996; P\u00e9rez \net al. 2005). This explains the occurrence of relatively fewer numbers of \nmaggots of other fly species, even Calliphoridae, when they coexisted with \nChrysomya albiceps on the same carrions. \nTantawi et al. (1996) and Wolff (2001) recorded Chrysomya albiceps as \nsecondary breeders on rabbit and pig carrions respectively. It has generally \nbelieved that Chrysomynae flies can act as primary species in the absence of \nCalliphorinae (Coe 1978; Braack 1981). However, Bharti and Singh (2003) \nreported that members of subfamily Chrysomynae can act as primary flies even \nwhen Calliphorinae is also available. This study showed Chrysomya albiceps \nwas primary invader on many rabbits and human corpses despite the presence \nof species of Calliphorinae. It is suggested that when the fly species is abundant \nit had a greater chance to compete and arrive first at the carrion. O\u2019Flynn and \nPage 53 of 124 \n \nMoorhouse (1979) found that Chrysominae are primary colonizers in warm \nseasons when they are abundant. \nCalliphora vicina was  amongst  the  first  to  colonize  rabbit  carcasses  and  its  \nadults and larvae were collected from human remains although its abundance \nand frequency was less than Chrysomya albiceps and P. ruficornis. This \ncalliphorid species prefers cooler temperatures (Gennard 2007). So, in \nsubtropical regions, it is present in the cooler months of the year (Aggarwal \n2005). Tantawi et al. (1996) recorded it on the rabbit carcass in winter only in \nEgypt. \nGreenberg (1991) noted that while higher temperatures >30\u00b0C accelerate the \ndevelopment of feeding instars of Calliphora vicina, the post feeding larvae fail \nto pupariate and subsequently die. The present study was conducted in the \ncooler season when ambient temperatures ranged between 16-19\u00b0C (average \n18\u00b0C). Further studies are needed to investigate carrion in different seasons. \nRepresentatives of the family Sarcophagidae are found throughout the world, \nwith most species occurring either in tropical or temperate regions (Byrd and \nCastner 2009). Flesh flies are primary invaders of carrion in warmer temperate \nand tropical regions (Payne 1965, Early and Goff 1986). Tantawi et al. (1996) \nfound that sarcophagids were primary flies on rabbit carrion in fall when \naverage ambient temperatures were 17\u00b0C comparable with those recorded in \nthis study during the time of the experiment. This study shows that flesh flies \nwere important components of carrion insects and the most important species \nwas P. ruficornis in Kuwait. This species has a worldwide distribution in Oriental \nregion, Afrotropical region and Australian region; also it is common in Saudi \nArabia (Al-Misned 2002). Nolte et al. (1992) found that P. ruficornis is an early \ninvader of remains and frequently encountered on the Island of Oahu. USA, this \nsarcophagid species is recorded in Kuwait for the first time and used in one \ncase from Kuwait to estimate PMI (Al-Mesbah et al.,  in  press).  Denno  and  \nCothran (1975) have stated that Sarcophagidae are known to prefer smaller \ncarcasses to avoid rich overlap with Calliphoridae. In this study, sarcophagid \nflies colonization on rabbit carcasses was as frequent as on human remains. \nPage 54 of 124 \n \nIn this study, it was found that species of family Muscidae are abundant and \nattracted to carrion during all stages of decomposition. However, they were \ncollected as adults and not larvae indicating that they visited carrions to feed not \nto breed. The same observation was recorded by Dear (1978) and De Souza \nand Linhares (1997). Similarly, Fannia sp. Did not breed on rabbit carcasses \nand occasionally their larvae found on human remains. De Jong and Chadwick \n(1999) found that adults of this species visited rabbit carcasses but they were \nuncommon. De Souza and Linhares (1997) also recorded no Fannia larvae on \nthe pig carcasses although large numbers of adult Fannia sp. were collected. \nSome tiny fly species of the families (Carnidae, Ephydridae, Periscelididae and \nSphaeroceridae) which visited rabbit carcasses to feed not to breed seem to be \nof minor importance regarding legal investigations. However, restriction of \nfamily Psychodidae to agriculture habitat and families Carnidae and \nPeriscelididae to coastal habitat may help to determine the location of death or \nwhether the victim has been moved. Caution must be used in these cases as \nflies may extend their range to other habitats. \n(Watson and Carlton 2003, 2005) found that sampling methods of adult flies \nusing pitfall, hands, or aerial sweep were problematic as numerous species of \nsmall to tiny flies were either underrepresented or completely overlooked. In this \nstudy, using sticky traps and the designated cage with fly collection chamber \nwere efficient and satisfactory to catch much tiny flies. \nIt has been found that there are differences in the arthropods community in \nvarious habitats in the same geographical area (Early and Goff 1986; Goff \n1991; Isiche et al. 1992). In Kuwait, there was a diversity of fly species between \nthe four habitats despite the close proximity of the studied locations. The same \nobservation was noted by Tullis and Goff (1987). \nThe greatest difference was significantly between desert and agriculture \nhabitats. This could be due to the differences of the ecological behavior of flies; \nthose prevailing particularly tiny flies of families Ephydridae, Psychodidae and \nSphaeroceridae in agriculture habitat could prefer shade and attracted to \nmanure of animals. \nPage 55 of 124 \n \nAnderson and VanLaerhoven (1996) found that seven pig carcasses \ndecomposed at the same rate, entering each stage synchronously and were \ncolonized by the same insect species at the same time. However, in this study, \nwhile used larger number of animal models, In contrary, variation in the rate of \ndecay was observed in this study although the carcasses were simultaneously \nexposed. This could be attributed to the large number of experimental animals, \nwhich increased the probability of greater individual variation. \nIt was observed that the percentage of body weight loss is less in heavier \ncarcasses than light ones although they were sampled in the same habitat and \nsampled in the same day as well as they were colonized by larvae; no \nexplanation can be given; Watson and Carlton (2003) noted that because of the \nlarge mass and unique fatty composition of a bear carcass, it remained in \nprolonged state of advanced and putrified decay. Keh (1985) has pointed out \nthat of two people dying at the same time and due to the same cause, \nputrefaction may proceed more rapidly in one body than in another. The natural \nintrinsic variability, resulting from genetic and physiological differences between \nindividuals of the same species, may affect the rate of decomposition (Turner \n1991). \nIn the coastal habitat, the carcasses sampled after two and four days were in \nfresh stage and colonized by no insects. After seven days in the same habitat, \nthe sampled carcasses were still in bloated stage and were exclusively \ncolonized by 1st, 2nd, immature 3rd instars of Sarcophagidae.  \nIt is obvious that the decay of the carcasses was slower when the arrival of \ninsects at them was delayed. This lends support to the concept that there is \ninter-dependence between insect colonization and the decomposition rate. This \nobservation has been recorded by many authors (Abell et al. 1982; Anderson \nand VanLaerhoven 1996; Simmons 2010). The explanation for the delayed \ncolonization of carcasses at the coastal habitat may be due to the local weather \nconditions, as it was raining during the first two days of the experiment. Heavy \nrain and humidity influence the blowfly activity and delay their arrival at carrion \n(Smith 1986). In addition, Greenberg (1990) has stated that calliphorids do not \nfly in rain. In Contrast, sarcophagid flies are considered to be unimpeded by rain \nPage 56 of 124 \n \n(Erzin\u00e7lio\u00f7lu 2000); as a result, flesh flies may be the initial colonizers of the \nbody if there is a long period of rainy weather. \nThe decomposition rate of carcasses at urban habitats was significantly faster \nthan that of those at other habitats. The speed of decomposition was \ndetermined by insect colonization and climatic conditions particularly \ntemperature (Anderson 2009). \nNo ants were collected from carcasses at the urban habitat, in contrary at other \nhabitats; Ants play a determining rate in the time taken for decomposition. The \nprocess is slowed down by the removal of large quantities of dipteran eggs and \nlarvae (Tullis and Goff 1987; Well and Greenberg 1994; Stoker et al. 1995; \nP\u00e9rez et al. 2005). \nThe mean temperatures, which were calculated from datalogger reading and \nthe records of the nearest meteorological states, were significantly higher at the \nUrban habitat than those at other habitats. This could be another reason of \nfaster speed of the carcass decomposition at urban habitat. In addition, at urban \nlocation, the carcasses were placed on a roof of a building with concrete \nground, not soil ground as at other habitat; this microhabitat was relatively \nhotter as concrete reflect sun rays. \nDuring 14 days, the period of the experiment, in November and December, \nwhen mean ambient temperatures were 18\u00b0C, the decomposition process of \nrabbit carcasses was studied. Though a continuous process, it is divided into \nvarious stages by different researchers (Goff 2010). In the present study the \ndecomposition process was evident in the form of four succession stages \n(fresh, bloated, decay, dry). These observable stages of decomposition were \ndefined also by Reed (1958), Rodriguez and Bass (1983), Braack (1986) and \nTantawi et al. (1986). The final decomposition stage was not observed in this \nexperiment except in one carcass at the urban location which reached dryness. \nIt is not surprising to observe prolonged decomposition duration of carcasses in \nthis time of the year and during a limited time period. Goddard and Lago (1985) \nstated that when temperatures are high, the decomposition process becomes \nshort. Another important factor contributing to the decomposition of a carcass is \nthe activity of necrophagous insects where arrival at carcasses and \nPage 57 of 124 \n \ndevelopment affected also by climatic conditions (Gennard 2007). In the warm \nclimate of the Kruger National Park, in South Africa, blowfly larvae were easily \ncapable of reducing a medium sized mammal such as impala to the dry stage \nwithin five days in summer and within 14 days in winter (Braack 1986). Even \nusing rabbit carcasses, Tantawi et al. (1996) found that carcasses in summer \nand  spring  decayed  at  a  much  faster  rate  than  those  in  fall  and  winter.  In  \nsummer, took only 4.5 days to reach dry stage when average daily \ntemperatures were 28\u00baC. In contrast, during winter, 51.5 days were required for \ncarcasses to reach the dry stage when average daily temperature ranged from \n13.6 to 16.6\u00b0C. \nIn human carcasses, many corpses reached the dry stage as they were \ndiscovered after enough time to be decomposed to the last stage of the \nprocess. Some corpses were discovered in hot season and decomposed fast in \nfew days. \nRodriguez and Bass (1983) noted that there is a direct correlation between the \nstage of decay and the succession of insect families and species arriving at a \ncarcass. In general, the succession patterns in this study were similar to those \ndescribed by Tantawi et al. (1966) and Anderson and VanLaerhoven (1996). \nIn  the  fresh  stage,  carcasses  were  colonized  by  few  adult  or  immature  flies  \nparticularly calliphorids and sarcophagids. The high peak of fly colonization was \nin bloated and decay stages as the odor become evident and the carcasses has \nbeen already occupied by eggs and larvae. Greenberg (1971) stated that flies \noviposit on a carcass after putrefactive odors develop and prefer to deposit \neggs in areas already colonized by calliphorid larvae. In the dry stage, no fly \nlarvae and only a few adults were observed on the carcasses as nutrient \nresources diminished. Beetles began to appear on rabbit carcasses in the \nbloated stage; similarly, they were observed on two human bodies which were \nin bloated stage and discovered in the open. \nHall and Huntington (2009) analyzed succession data on arthropods on human \ncadavers from Rodriguez and Bass (1983) and showed that beetles are present \nmainly during bloated and dry stage of decomposition. However, the majority of \nPage 58 of 124 \n \ntheir numbers were in the dry stage. In this study, a dried human corpse was \nexclusively occupied by beetles. \n In case No.3, the body of the female victim was divided and some parts were \nburned. After 4 days postmortem her burnt hands were found to be colonized \nwith eggs Calliphora vicina. Catts and Goff (1992) suggested burning of the \nflesh retarded its immediate attraction to adult blowflies. However, Avila and \nGoff (1998) observed immediate attraction of calliphorid flies to the burnt corpse \nand significant oviposition was evident on day 2. There are many reasons for \nlimitation of access by insects including climatic conditions, burying \nconcealment (Anderson, 2009). Hiding the hands for sometime before throwing \nthem, prevent the access of blowflies and the colonization was delayed. \nIn case No.13, the female victim was in fresh stage of decay and colonized by \n1st and 2nd instars of different fly species at a cut wound on her neck; no other \nsites  on  the  body  were  colonized  with  insects.  This  gives  an  indication  that  \ninjuries on a corpse are more attractive sites for fly colonization than the natural \nopenings. Rodriguez and Bass (1983) have stated that a corpse may be more \ndecomposed in the area of the body where there are injuries which result in \nexposure of blood and underlying tissue, thus providing access for carrion \nbacteria and insects. In this case, entomological evidence helped with other \nevidences to know the manner of death which was slaughtering of the victim \nwith a sharp tool. \nCarvalho et al. (2000) found that the adult flies that were attracted to human \ncorpses were the same species that were collected on pig carcasses. Similarly, \nin this study, the attractiveness to necrophagous flies exerted by human \nremains and rabbit carcasses was the same. This gives support to the concept \nthat a database of forensic insects collected from experimental animals can be \nused for human corposes in the same habitat in legal investigations. Arnaldos et \nal. (2005) used the entomological data obtained from experimental studies \nusing chicken carcasses in order to determine PMI in real forensic cases in the \nsame habitat. \nIn addition, the assemblages of necrophagous flies on human remains and \nrabbit carcasses revealed that the diversity of fly species of forensic importance \nPage 59 of 124 \n \nand their succession patterns were the same regardless the size of carrion. \nKuusela and Hanski (1982) and Hewadikaram and Goff (1991) found that the \nsize of the carrion has no obvious effect on the composition of the insect fauna \nor succession pattern. No differences were observed between patterns of \nsuccession based on the use of the cat or pig carcasses in the same habitat \n(Early and Goff 1986). \nPage 60 of 124 \n \nChapter 5: CONCLUSIONS \nThis study shows there are four species of Calliphoridae: Chrysomya albiceps, \nCalliphora vicina, Chrysomya megacephala and L. sericata, four species of \nSarcophagidae: P. ruficornis, S. africa Sarcophaga sp. and W. nuba,  that  can  \nbe considered of potential forensic importance and can be used as indicators of \nPMI in Kuwait as they are able to breed on carrion. However, the most \nimportant of these are Chrysomya albiceps and P. ruficornis as  they  are  the  \nmost frequent and abundant and the primary colonizers on decomposing \nhuman remains and rabbit carcasses in different habitats. \nAlthough this study was conducted in one season and for a short period, the \ndata obtained from it are useful for many reasons: it enriches the biodiversity of \nKuwait as some families or species of Diptera are recorded for the first time in \nthis country (Chrysomya megacephala, Hemeromyia sp., Fannia canicularis, \nMusca sorbens, Periscelis sp., and Parasarcophaga ruficornis). However, some \nflies were mentioned in unpublished medical and veterinary reports. The study \nprovides database information on species composition and succession patterns \nof necrophagous flies, these data are valuable for forensic entomology analysis \nas no carrion data were previously available for this region. In addition, this \nstudy  reveals  that  Kuwait  has  its  own  carrion  Diptera  composition  and  \nconfirmed that insect succession on carrion is geographically specific. \nThe carrion Diptera composition and their succession patterns obtained from \nreal forensic cases showed a number of basic similarities to those observed on \nrabbit carcasses as experiment animals. This supports the validity of the \nexperimental data to be considered as representative of the circumstances \noccurring in a human cadaver as well as relieves the controversy about the \nvalidity of using certain animals (small sized) as experimental models. As the \nimpossibility of using human corpses for those kinds of studies particularly in \nKuwait and other Arab countries owing to religion considerations, it means that \nanimal models are needed. The result of this study may be considered to be \nuseful for forensic practice in the geographical area references. \nThe involvement of this study in legal investigation enabled the officials and the \ninvestigators to be familiar with and aware of the importance of forensic \nPage 61 of 124 \n \nentomology as well as initiated their interest in more information and further \nstudies in this field. \nThis study also highlights the importance of forensic entomology in Kuwait. \nUsing entomological tools helped with other evidences to know the manner of \ndeath in case No.13, estimated the PMI in case No.5 (Al-Mesbah et al., in \npress) and provided evidence on the cause of death (toxicity) by chemical \nanalysis feeding maggots in case No.10. \nThe study, it is hoped, will be the first step in presenting forensic entomology as \na  science  and  a  new  discipline  in  Kuwait  as  well  as  raising  the  role  of  the  \nentomologist and the value of entomological information in legal investigations \nto be used as evidence in the court. \n \nPage 62 of 124 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDICES \n  \nPage 63 of 124 \n  \n \nAPPENDIX A \nSupplementary Figures \nApp. A-1: Site A (desert habitat) \nApp. A-2: Site B (urban habitat) \nApp. A-3: Site C (agriculture habitat) \nApp. A-4: Site D (costal habitat) \nApp. A-5: Showing a man made fabric cage \nApp. A-6: Hinged opening at one side of the outer screen and inner cloth frame \nof the cage \nApp. A-7: Showing a hole made in one side of the inner cloth frame of the cage \nApp. A-8: Distribution of the cages and sticky traps at a site \nApp. A-9: Ten rabbits after killing of site A \nApp. A-10: Weighing of rabbits before placing cages \nApp. A-11: Placing a rabbit in a cage at day 0 of the experiment \nApp. A-12: Site A, group a, carcass no.1 \nApp. A-13: A large bag used for transportation of the caged carcasses and \ncorresponding sticky traps to the laboratory \nApp. A-14: Weighing a carcass in the laboratory \nApp. A-15: Desiccation and examination of a carcass for insects in the laboratory \nApp. A-16: Rearing of immature larvae on beef minced meat \nApp. A-17: The rearing containers are covered with gauze \nApp. A-18: Sawdust for pupation of 3rd instars \nApp. A-19: Observation of rearing and pupation of larvae in the laboratory \nbackyard \nApp. A-20: Killing the 3rd instar larvae in boiling water \nApp. A-21: Identification and counting of larvae \nApp. A-22: Collecting egg, 1st and 2nd instar larvae with paint brush \nApp. A-23: Collecting 3rd instar larvae with entomological forceps \nApp. A-24: Collecting of pupae \nApp. A-25: Adult flies attached to the sticky traps \nApp. A-26: Adult flies trapped in the bottle (collection chamber) \nApp. A-27: Adult flies removed carefully and placed in vials for identification \nand counting \nApp. A-28: (a) Cage (b) Sticky traps (c) Pupation container (d) Vials are labeled \nwith the same ID number and color \nApp. A-29: The emergences of adult flies \nApp. A-30: Placement of the datalogger at the site \nApp. A-31: Enclosure of the datalogger in waterproof casting \nApp. A-32: Kuwait map shows the distribution of all the weather stations of the \nDirectorate General of Civil Aviation \nPage 64 of 124 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApp. A-1: Site A (desert habitat). \nA\n \nBu y  Sma rtDr a w!-  p ur ch a s ed  co p ie s  p rin t  th is  \nd o cu me n t  wi th o ut  a  wa te rm ar k .\nVi si t  ww. s mar td ra w. co m  or  c a l  1- 80 0 -
