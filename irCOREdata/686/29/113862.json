Email: b.rienties@surrey.ac.uk  \nA review of the role of ICT and course design in transitional education \npractices \n \n \nAn increasing number of higher educational institutes are offering remedial, bridging, preparatory \nor transitional courses in a blended and online format to remediate and enhance students\u2019 \nknowledge and skills. This paper addresses how teachers and institutes design and implement \nthese courses. The descriptions of transitional courses were collected by means of an online \nquestionnaire and results were stored in a searchable online database. In the questionnaire \nconsisting of 38 closed and open-ended questions, teachers had to indicate their content, context, \norganisation, pedagogical approach, assessment method and ICT use. During February-May 2009, \n118 course descriptions and implementations were collected. These 118 course descriptions were \nanalysed with the aim of describing their main educational scenarios using multiple \ncorrespondence analysis and two-step clustering analysis. The results indicate that courses can be \nexplained by five dimensions: 1) ICT; 2) Mathematics versus language; 3) Lower versus higher \nBloom levels; 4) Gamma sciences versus others; and 5) Very small group size versus others. \nAfterwards, the courses were positioned into six distinctive clusters. An important finding of this \nstudy is that teachers seem to design and implement fairly similar course designs when content, \ncontext and pedagogical approach are given. Furthermore, teachers\u2019 choices about ICT use are not \nyet systematically and consensually linked to content and pedagogical choices. \n \nKeywords: ICT; Course design; pedagogical approach, role of teacher; multi-method approach \n \nIntroduction \nIn an increasingly globalising world, businesses are looking for excellent graduates \nwith international experience and state-of-the-art knowledge and skills (Van der Wende, \n2003). An increasing number of students is studying abroad in order to acquire international \nexperience and to increase their attractiveness for international companies (Rienties, \nGrohnert, Kommers, Niemantsverdriet, & Nijhuis, 2011; Rienties & Tempelaar, 2009). For \nexample, in Europe the number of students that are studying at a higher educational institute \noutside their home country has increased with 57% from 327.500 in 1998 to 515.400 in 2006 \n(EUROSTAT, s.d.). \nThis increased heterogeneity of enrolments in higher education has an unquestionable \nimpact on transitional problems. Common transitional problem areas for students are found in \nmathematics, language, research methods or intercultural skills. In fact, there is a growing \nconcern among educators and policy makers that learners \u2013 foreign and local \u2013 are not well-\nprepared to start a bachelor or master programme (Jindal-Snape, 2010).  \nAs a result, an increasing number of higher educational institutes is tackling these \ntransitional problems by designing remedial courses, transitional courses, summer courses, \ndevelopmental courses or preparatory courses, to equip learners with required knowledge, \nskills and competences before entering a higher education programme (Attewell, Lavin, \nDomina, & Levey, 2006; Bettinger & Long, 2005; Brants & Struyven, 2009; Brouwer, \nEkimova, Jasinska, Van Gastel, & Virgailaite-Meckauskaite, 2009; Rienties, Tempelaar, Van \nden Bossche, Gijselaers, & Segers, 2009; Tempelaar, Rienties, & Giesbers, 2009). Remedial \neducation is a common approach to prepare students both academically and socially during \nthe early stages of college and university (Attewell, et al., 2006; Bettinger & Long, 2005). \nDifferences in cognitive demands, nature of tasks, self-regulation, the amount of self-study, \nand discovery learning required in higher education settings are pinpointed as causes for a \nneed for transitional education (Conley, 2007; McCabe & Day, 1998).  \nIn the United States 98% of 2-year public colleges and 80% of public institutions \noffer at least one remedial course in reading, writing or mathematics (Attewell, et al., 2006; \nBoyer, Butner, & Smith, 2007; Kozeracki, 2002). Mathematics is the most common remedial \nsubject, followed by reading and writing (Attewell, et al., 2006; Merisotis & Phipps, 2000). \nRegarding the context of remedial coursework, courses can be characterised as either \nembedded in the regular academic programme or separate from the programme; for example \nprior to a given programme in the form of summer schools (Brants & Struyven, 2009; \nBrouwer, et al., 2009; Rienties, Tempelaar, Dijkstra, Rehm, & Gijselaers, 2008; Rienties, et \nal., 2009; Roueche & Roueche, 1999; Tempelaar, et al., 2009). \nRemedial courses are not only organised in face-to-face settings. Often for practical \nreasons transitional courses are offered in an blended or distance format (Brants & Struyven, \n2009; Rienties, Tempelaar, Waterval, Rehm, & Gijselaers, 2006). Information \nCommunication Technology (ICT) has powerful Web 2.0 tools that might benefit learners. In \nfact, ICT has gained the power to support independent learning as well as to learn irrespective \nof time and geographical constraints with the wide-spread implementation of Internet \n(Bryant, Khale, & Schafer, 2005; Lou, Bernard, & Abrami, 2006; Resta & Laferri\u00e8re, 2007; \nWheeler, 2007). Using internet technologies, learners can follow individually tailored \nblended or distance courses such as mathematics (Brouwer, et al., 2009), statistics \n(Tempelaar, et al., 2009) or accounting (Bryant, et al., 2005) while being off-campus. This \nenhances the flexibility of learners to combine work, internship or holiday with study, which \nis of great value in transitional courses. Besides enriching independent learning experiences \nfor learners, recently several powerful ICT tools and methods for learning in collaborative \nsettings have been developed where learners work and learn together (J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, J\u00e4rvenoja, & \nVeermans, 2008; Jonassen & Kwon, 2001; Resta & Laferri\u00e8re, 2007; Schellens, Van Keer, \nDe Wever, & Valcke, 2009; Wang, 2009). Recent research on transitional education using \nICT  has  highlighted  that  in  particular  the  interactivity,  adaptivity  and  possibilities  of  rapid  \nfeedback of ICT tools and interactive learning environments are important merits when \nstudents are not able to come to college or university or when students have large knowledge \nor skills gaps (Brants & Struyven, 2009; Rienties, et al., 2009; Rienties, et al., 2006; \nTempelaar, et al., 2009; Wieland et al., 2007). However, according to Wang (2009, p. 1), the \nadvantages of more student-centred, engaging and reflective interactive and collaborative \nlearning environments \u201cdo not happen spontaneously unless the learning environments are \nthoughtfully designed\u201d. \nThe role of the teacher in creating and facilitating an interactive learning environment \nis widely acknowledged as being one of the core elements of successful blended and online \nlearning (De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, & Simons, 2007; L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m & Nevgi, 2008; Mazzolini & \nMaddison, 2003). Several researchers (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 1999; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 & \nH\u00e4kkinen, 2002; Kirschner, Strijbos, Kreijns, & Beers, 2004; Koehler & Mishra, 2005; \nMishra & Koehler, 2006; Resta & Laferri\u00e8re, 2007) have addressed that an effective \neducational design using ICT should involve cognitive, pedagogical, social and technological \nelements. In a range of studies on effective blended and online course designs, Mishra and \nKoehler (2006) found that teachers should carefully balance and integrate their cognitive, \npedagogical and technological knowledge when designing and teaching blended or online \ncourses. In a study among 27 novice teachers who followed an e-learning training program, \nL\u00f6fstr\u00f6m and Nevgi (2008) indicate that the pedagogical awareness of these teachers with \nrespect to ICT was well-established. However, in many courses that are adjusted into blended \nor  online  settings  teachers  commonly  add  an  ICT tool  or  use  an  ICT tool  with  a  particular  \npurpose without adjusting the cognitive content and\/or pedagogical approach of the course \n(Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Resta & Laferri\u00e8re, 2007). As a result, the learning experience of \nstudents following the online version of the course might be less rich than students following \na face-to-face course (J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, et al., 2008; Jonassen & Kwon, 2001).  \nIn a review of 20 years of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning research, Resta \nand Laferri\u00e8re (2007, p. 76) recommend that \u201cresearch is needed on the organisational issues \nrelated to implement CSCL in higher education to determine the essential conditions that \nmust be in place for effective faculty use of CSCL\u201d. Furthermore, given the complex nature \nof blended and online learning, several researchers (De Laat, et al., 2007; Hurme, Palonen, & \nJ\u00e4rvel\u00e4, 2007; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, et al., 2008) recommend to analyse effective course designs using an \nintegrated multi-method approach. In line with these recommendations and the urge of Resta \nand Laferri\u00e8re (2007) and others to assess the role of ICT in real-world educational settings, \nthis paper addresses how teachers design and implement interactive learning environments \nusing ICT in face-to-face, blended and distance education. In particular, we will review the \ndesign and implementation of cognitive, pedagogical, social, organisational and technological \ncourse elements in 118 transitional courses using a multi-method approach. The research \nquestions are: \n(1) What are the main dimensions along which transitional courses differ from each other? \n(2) What constellations of content, context, organisation, pedagogical approach, assessment, \nICT usage often co-occur and can therefore be considered tested or \u2018good\u2019 practices? \nMethods \nSample and data collection \nAn online questionnaire was built based upon an extensive literature review (Brants & \nStruyven, 2009), needs-analysis and experience from several projects on transitional \neducation (Rienties, et al., 2008; Rienties, et al., 2006). The six key factors of transitional \neducation (content, context, organisation, pedagogical approach, assessment, ICT usage) \nwere integrated into a questionnaire of 38 open and closed questions. The questionnaire was \ndistributed via the EARLI (EARLI, 2009a, 2009b) and EDINEB networki to teachers, \ndesigners and organizers of transitional courses, with an open invitation to share their course \ndesigns. A total of 118 transitional courses reported by 84 respondents from 65 institutions \nand from 22 countries were gathered in the period February-May 2009, whereby a distinction \nwas made between face-to-face, blended and distance education settings. For each of the \neight categories below there was an open field in which respondents could add explanations \nto their standardised answers. Furthermore, there were separate open fields for providing \ncomments, and a rationale for the transitional activity as a whole. \n(1) Identification: country, organising institution, course name, name and email address of \nthe respondent. Respondents could indicate whether they wanted their course design to be \npublicly viewable on the web (75 out of 118 gave permission)ii. \n(2) Content: discipline and skills taught during the course, aim(s) of the course (reviving \nforgotten knowledge, learning new knowledge), flexibility of the course content. \n(3) Context: the scheduling of the transitional course relative to the regular higher education \nprogram was probed: is the course scheduled before the start of the program (e.g. summer \ncourse), or in parallel to it? In case of parallel scheduling, it was asked how the \ntransitional activity was related or integrated with the regular program. \n(4) Organisation: who organises the course (university staff or a commercial party)?; was \nspecial funding available for developing and implementing the course?; do students pay \nfor  participation?;  is  attendance  of  the  course  obligatory?;  what  was  the  number  of  \nstudents attending the course?; is it distance, blended or face-to-face learning? \n(5) Pedagogical approach, including support: work-format (individual, collaborative, both), \ntypes of individual tasks (exercises, presentations, ...), types of group tasks (discussions, \nprojects, ...), instructional support (teacher, peers, digital tutor, ...).  \n(6) Assessment:  the  timing  (before,  after,  during  the  transitional  activity),  the  purpose  \n(formative, summative, both), the form (exam, essay, ...), the adaptivity of assessment \nwas  questioned.  In  addition,  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  to  what  extent  the  \nassessment focussed on knowledge and skills. \n(7) ICT use: for a range of possible purposes respondents had to indicate whether ICT was \nused and for that purpose or not. Furthermore, a collection of ICT tools was presented, \nwith checkboxes to indicate whether these tools were used. \n(8) Evaluation: there was one open text field in which respondents could share their \nevaluation of the course. Respondents were left free to either give personal impressions, \ncite formal evaluation results such as documents of evidence or providing references to \npublications. \n \nData analysis \nThe data were analysed using a multi-method approach. First of all, a Multiple \nCorrespondence Analysis (MCA) was used to provide an answer to the first research \nquestion: to find the most important dimensions on which transitional courses in our database \ndistinguish. MCA is the categorical data analogue of factor analysis or principle component \nanalysis for quantitative data. MCA determines the independent dimensions that explain most \nof the variation in the dataset. Like in factor analysis, these dimensions are constructed to be \nindependent, are characterised by a decreasing contribution in the explanation of total \nvariation, and an eigenvalue criterion is used to decide on the number of dimensions. MCA \ntakes its name from the fact that it portrays the correspondence of categories of variables.  \nTo elaborate the second research question as to which constellations of content, \ncontext, organisation, pedagogical approach, assessment, and ICT usage often co-occur, \ncluster analysis was applied. Of the three general approaches to cluster analysis, hierarchical, \nK-means, and two-step clustering, the last approach is most suited for categorical data. \nTherefore, we applied two-step clustering to assign all courses to clusters based on similarity, \nwith Schwarz's Bayesian criterion (BIC) as the clustering criterion, and log-likelihood as the \ndistance measure.  The clustering could have been applied to the raw data, but anticipating \nthe  results  of  the  MCA,  that  provide  evidence  that  a  substantial  part  of  the  variation  in  the  \ndata is adequately expressed by using only five independent dimensions instead of the \noriginal 68 variables, a two-step clustering procedure, where the clustering takes place with \nregard to the dimensions produced by the MCA, was regarded as most appropriate.  \nFinally, a content analysis was conducted on the eight category evaluation as well as \nother open text fields. First of all, three general approaches were brought forward by the \nrespondents  in  order  to  provide  evidence  of  the  effectiveness  of  their  course  design  and  \nimplementation (i.e. students\u2019 response based upon evaluation questionnaire or interview, \nrespondent\u2019s opinion, proof of effect of intervention in form of data or publication). This \ninvestigation started from the assumption that respondents would by and large report \ntransitional practices that they were proud of and satisfied with. It was not to be expected that \nan equally good sample of negatively evaluated courses would be obtained. Therefore, our \nidea was to regard all clusters found as good practices, until the opposite is proved. In total 21 \ncourse descriptions included students\u2019 responses, 21 course descriptions included the \nrespondent\u2019s or teacher\u2019s opinion, 36 course descriptions included multiple opinions from \nstakeholders (students, teachers, management, etc.) and 4 were uncodeable. Afterwards, all \nevidence provided by the respondents to proof their good practice was categorised on a 4-\npoint scale (negative, moderately negative, moderately positive, positive) by an independent \ncoder who is a trained educational psychologist. For each of the clusters we checked if being \na member of that cluster correlated with course evaluation. In addition, for each of the MCA \ndimensions we checked the correlation with course evaluation using Spearman\u2019s rho \ncorrelation. \nResults \nDescriptive statistics of purpose of ICT usage \nIn Table 1, the purpose of usage of ICT in face-to-face, blended and distance transitional \neducation is illustrated. On average, in transitional face-to-face education ICT is used for 2.6 \npurposes, whereby standard deviations in Table 1 are illustrated in brackets. In the 46 face-to-\nface education courses in our database, ICT is primarily used for storage (e.g. course \nmaterials, lecture materials) and communication with students (e.g. announcements, emails). \nIn total 4 respondents indicated not to have used ICT in their face-to-face education. In total \n47 courses are identified by respondents as blended education, where part of the educational \nexperience of students takes place outside the class-room. On average, ICT is used for 5.8 \npurposes in blended transitional courses ICT is primarily used for communication, storage, \nsubmitting (i.e. assignments), web-searches and collaboration (with peer-students and \nteacher). Finally, 26 course descriptions are identified by respondents as distance education, \nwhereby on average ICT is used for 6.3 purposes. In the majority of transitional courses in \ndistance education ICT is intensively used for storage, assessment, feedback after tests \ncommunication, submitting and tests. Except for ICT for presentations and ICT for other \npurposes, significant differences are found between the three forms of education using a Chi-\nSquare test as is shown in Table 1. In general, when transitional education is designed in a \ndistance-learning format, ICT is used for more purposes than blended and face-to-face \neducation and the role of ICT in assessment and feedback is considerably more important. \n---------- \nInsert Table 1 about here \n----------- \n \nDimensions for describing transitional teaching practices  \nAlthough Table 1 indicates that teachers have different purposes for ICT usage when courses \nare taught in face-to-face, blended or distance education, a more complex analysis is needed \nin order to distinguish the cognitive, pedagogical, social, organisational and technological \nelements in the course design and implementation. Therefore, a Multiple Correspondence \nAnalysis (MCA) was conducted on the 118 transitional courses. The MCA resulted in a five-\ndimensions  solution  that  explained  47%  of  variation  of  our  data.  The  decision  to  ignore  \nhigher dimensions was based on Cronbach's alpha (0.73 for dimension 6, and lower for the \nhigher ones), as well as on the result that total explained variation is only slowly increasing \nfor dimensions higher than five (about 4% extra explained variation  for each added \ndimension). The dimensions found were interpreted by reviewing the variables that correlate \nhighly or exclusively with each of the dimensions, and by checking significance of \ncorrelations (chi-square test, P < 0.05) between such variables (Michailidis & De Leeuw, \n1998). In the cluster analysis, the optimal number of clusters was found to be four. However, \none of these four clusters had an unclear profile and contained half the courses in our sample. \nTherefore, a clustering into 5 and 6 clusters was forced. The quality of the obtained clusters \nwas  checked  by  plotting  the  clusters  in  the  first  two  dimensions  as  revealed  by  MCA  and  \nrequiring that clusters have clear boundaries in the MCA picture (See Michailidis & De \nLeeuw, 1998). Using that same criterion, a clustering into seven or more clusters was \nrejected. The five dimensions that are characterised with decreasing contribution to variance \n(V) from the MCA can be interpreted as follows: \n(1) ICT: less versus more ICT (V = 15%). From the 68 variables in our questionnaire, 30 can \nbe a priori classified as being about ICT. From these, 25 have their main component \nalong this dimension. Reversing the argument: there are 11 variables that point \"almost \npurely\" along this dimension (the next component is at least a factor 3 smaller) and all of \nthose are about use of ICT. We conclude that this dimension measures use of ICT: on one \nside are 37 courses that use little ICT tools and 4 courses that use no ICT tools in their \neducation and primarily use traditional face-to-face education tools like paper and pencil. \nOn the other side there are 58 courses that intensively use ICT tools, in the middle are 19 \ncourses that integrate ICT tools with face-to-face education tools, as was found in Table \n1.  \n(2) Mathematics versus language (V = 11%). This dimension is related to the content and the \npedagogical approach of courses: 22 Mathematics courses are at the negative end of this \nscale, 57 courses teaching a specific language are at the positive end, while 39 courses are \nlocated in the middle. This finding is in line with research on remedial education, \nwhereby mostly mathematics, language and writing courses are given (Attewell, et al., \n2006; Brants & Struyven, 2009; Rienties, et al., 2008). This content aspect correlates with \na number of didactical decisions: the negative half of the scale correlates with \nindividualised pedagogical approaches, individualised course content, and distance \nlearning. The positive half correlates with work forms involving collaboration, course \ncontent differentiated according to subgroup, non-distance learning. One organisational \nvariable plays a role: courses on the negative half of the scale more often have funding. \n(3) Bloom levels: lower versus higher (V =  9%).  11  courses  are  positioned  on  the  negative  \nhalf of this axis tend to have: assessment focused on knowledge; exercises done \nindividually; content is adapted for subgroups; assessment is done for summative \npurposes; and a commercial institute (instead of a higher educational institute) is often \norganising such a course. These courses possibly aim at realising higher educational \ninstitute entrance requirements in a short time. Therefore, they are more often scheduled \nbefore the regular higher educational program. At the middle of the scale are 41 higher \neducational institute-organised courses that are less focused on knowledge, less individual \nexercises, content is not adapted to subgroups, scheduling is more often during the regular \nstudy program and assessment is less often summative. Finally, 66 courses on the positive \nhalf of this axis tend to be positioned in the regular study program. We might interpret \nthat these courses have less time restrictions and therefore more freedom in choosing \nwork formats that cater also to the higher Bloom levels (Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, & \nKrathwohl, 1956). \n(4) Gamma sciences versus others (V = 7%). This dimension separates the social-, business \nand managerial sciences from the other disciplines: the 9 gamma science courses are on \nthe positive side of the scale, 109 courses that are characterised as \u201cother sciences\u201d have \ntheir centre of gravity on the negative side. Courses at the positive half of the scale have \nassessments focusing less often on skills. \n(5) Group size: very small versus others (V = 5%). This dimension separates a relatively \nsmall number of 17 courses far on one side of the scale, while the majority is close to the \norigin. The isolated small group has: very small group size (1-10 participants), \ncollaborative work form, the transitional activity is  optional and scheduled in parallel  to \nthe  regular  course  that  needs  the  skills,  and  assessment  is  less  often  done  for  formative  \nreasons. \n \nThese results show that content or discipline taught is not a one-dimensional concept: \ntwo of the five dimensions (dimensions 2 and 4) found are strongly related to content. This is \nto be expected: why would mathematics, languages and gamma sciences fit to one \ndimension? In the same way: pedagogy appears not to be a one-dimensional concept, with \npedagogical choices showing up in three of the five dimensions (dimensions 2, 3 and 5). \nDimension \"2. Mathematics versus language\" shows many educational design choices \ncorrelating with the content aspect of this dimension. \nSeeing that both content and pedagogy appear as multi-dimensional, it may come as a \nsurprise that ICT-use appears as only one dimension: relatively many ICT related variables \ncorrelate with each other, using ICT for purpose X increases the likelihood of also using it for \nY. However, ICT-related variables in general are not playing a prominent role in other \ndimensions than the first. The notable exceptions (r > 0.3 on other dimensions) are: the \nchoice between distance learning, blended and face-to-face (dimensions 1 and 2), and the use \nof assessment in the form of a digital exam (stronger on dimension 2 than on 1), which was \nalso found in the previous section. \nThe five dimensions presented above are ordered according to their decreasing \ncontribution to the explained variation in our dataset. However, this ordering in itself is not to \nbe viewed as a result, because it is in large part an artefact of the questions asked. For \ninstance, the fact that the dimension \"1. ICT, less versus more\" explains the largest part of the \nvariation reflects the number of questions asked about ICT, therefore reflects our research \ninterests rather than being a result. The above observation about the ICT-variables mainly \ncorrelating among themselves, in contrast, is to be regarded as a result, because each of these \nICT variables had the potential to correlate with e.g. each of the pedagogic variables, but only \nfew of them did show such a correlation.  \nSix clusters of transitional courses portrayed \nOur multi-method approach directed at understanding the design and implementation of \ninteractive  learning  environments  has  two-step  clustering  (BIC)  as  the  second  tool.  By  the  \nmethod described we arrived at a six cluster solution. In order to integrate both methods, we \nwill interpret the six clusters in terms of their scores on the MCA dimensions. We will use the \nfirst four dimensions found by MCA to give an insightful presentation of differences between \nthe clusters. The fifth dimension does not show a clear separation between any of the 6 \nclusters found. When we label all  the courses with their  cluster-number and afterwards plot \nall courses in the first two dimensions as revealed by MCA, the result is as in Figure 1. From \nFigure 1 we conclude that each of the clusters occupies its own region, with only limited \noverlap at the boundaries. This implies that teachers design fairly similar courses in a \nparticular context, which depends on the course content (mathematics, language) and learning \nsetting (face-to-face, blended, distance). \n----- \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n----- \n \nThe number of courses in each cluster, as well as the number of countries involved, is shown \nin Table 2. Furthermore, in Figure 2, typical values for variables that turned out strong \ndiscriminators  (r  >  0.4  with  one  dimension  or  >  0.3  with  two  or  more  dimensions)  during  \nMCA for each of the clusters are given. In Figure 2, the clusters are again spread out in \nMCA-dimensions 1 and 2 (ICT and Mathematics vs. language), and those variables strongly \nrelated to these dimensions are highlighted, while the others (strongly related to dimension 3, \n4 or 5, but not to 1 or 2) are shown in grey. For example, for cluster 6 lower right this implies \nthat ICT is distinctively and intensively used in a collaborative distance setting for business \neducation along dimension 1 and 2. Furthermore, the assessment of this cluster of courses is \non  individual  knowledge  exercises  at  a  lower  Bloom  taxonomy  dimension  3,  while  the  \nassessment it not focussed on skills along the gamma science dimension 4. \n------ \nInsert Table 2 about here \n------ \n \n \nThe six clusters found can now be characterised as follows, using as names their place \nin the MCA-dimensions 1 and 2 with respect to the origin (in clockwise order): \n------ \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n------ \n \n(3) Left. These 30 courses have in common that they use little or no ICT. Face-to-face \nteaching is the only teaching method. Furthermore, collaborative work is used relatively \noften. Finally, in 14 courses there is no assessment, which is unique to this cluster: \noutside  this  cluster  all  courses  have  assessment  in  one  form or  another.  With  respect  to  \ncontent, this cluster is mixed.  \n(5) Upper left. These 11 courses all originated from one author from one institution. Like the \nprevious cluster, ICT is not used intensively and teaching occurs face-to-face. Half of \nthese courses focus on learning a language, the other half focus on other discipline \nspecific skills. The pedagogical approach is equally often collaborative as individual. The \ncourses are organised by a commercial party, have a small group size (11-20), exercises \nare done individually and assessments focus on knowledge. \n(1) Near upper right. These 36 courses use ICT for various purposes but not for assessment, \nwhich is why they appear in the middle of dimension \"1. ICT: less versus more\". They are \non the language-half of dimension \"2. Mathematics versus language\". However, these \ncourses are not about language but about academic skills. Like most language courses \nteachers have designed their courses in an equal mix of collaborative and individual work \nusing blended learning. \n(4) Far upper right. These 10 courses use ICT for almost all possible purposes and teachers \nin these courses use ICT tools whose use is rare in other clusters. Half of these courses are \nlanguage courses, the other half of the courses are other discipline specific skills. \nTeachers in this cluster use blended learning and their pedagogy is more often \ncollaborative. Assessment focuses on skills. In half of these courses, a commercial party \norganises the course. \n(6) Lower right. These 9 courses are from four teachers in one institution. These teachers use \nICT for assessment as well as for collaboration, which places them on the right half of the \nICT-dimension. The courses are on the mathematics half of dimension \"2. Mathematics \nversus language\", but the content is gamma sciences: they share with most mathematics \ncourses the use of distance learning, exercises are done individually, and assessments \nfocus  on  knowledge.  A  difference  with  the  cluster  2  of  mathematics  courses  is  the  \nemphasis on collaborative work.  \n(2) Down. These 22 courses are in large majority about mathematics. Most teachers in this \ncluster use distance learning, have flexible content adapted to the individual and use a \nself-directed learning approach. Furthermore, assistance and feedback is often provided \nby an online tool instead of a teacher, and the assessment focuses on knowledge. ICT is \nimportant for this group of courses but it is used for a limited number of purposes. \nFinally, the number of different ICT tools used is limited, making them earn a place in the \nmiddle of the ICT-dimension. \n  \nFrom the clustering it becomes obvious that there's some granularity in our data: \nsometimes courses share a design because they originate from one institution, or even from \none author. Two such single-institution clusters were found (clusters 5 and 6). Finding such \nclusters was not our priority, but on the other hand, separating them off helped in giving the \nremaining clusters a clearer profile. \nThe same six clusters can also be pictured in the higher MCA-dimensions 3, 4 and 5. \nIn Figure 3, the distinguishing variables for the dimension \"3. Lower versus higher Bloom \nlevels\" are highlighted. Three of the six clusters are on the lower side of this dimension. Two \nof those three clusters are relatively close to the origin: their course designs contain more \nindividual exercises and assessment focuses on knowledge rather than skills. The third \ncluster, being positioned further down on that same side, also has a small group size, content \ndifferentiated according to subgroups, and a commercial party organising the course. \n------ \nInsert Figure 3 about here \n----- \n \nIn Figure 4 the distinguishing variables for the dimension \"4. Gamma sciences versus \nothers\" are highlighted. One cluster of nine courses singles itself out on the gamma side of \nthe scale: it has assessments that focus less often on skills. One other cluster singles itself out \nat the other side of the scale, but stays relatively close to the origin: it has assessments that \nfocus more often on skills. The other four clusters have near-neutral positions on dimension \n4. Finally, with regard to the dimension \"5. very small courses versus others\" we found that \nnone of our six clusters singles itself out on either side of this dimension.  \n-------- \nInsert Figure 4 about here \n-------- \n \nEvaluation results \nAs a third and last part of our multi-method approach, we conducted a content analysis on the \nopen parts of the questionnaire. Content analysis of submitted course evaluations and various \nother text fields in our questionnaire indicates that authors of submitted course descriptions in \nlarge majority evaluated their courses positively, with only 9 out of 82 evaluations being \nnegative (Table 4). The data and arguments mentioned to support these evaluations vary \nwidely in kind and quality. The nine negative evaluations were unequally distributed over the \nsix clusters of courses (Table 3): six of those nine negative evaluations occurred in cluster \"3. \nLeft\",  the cluster that  had little or no ICT and often no assessment,  while cluster \"5.  Upper \nleft\" has a higher than average number of positive evaluations.  \n---------- \nInsert Table 3 about here \n----------- \n Cluster 5 is a small cluster, where all courses having been submitted by a single \nauthor, who consistently evaluated the submitted courses as positive. Cluster 3 is a large \ncluster with 30 courses from 13 countries and many different authors. For 18 of these courses \nevaluations are known: one third of these is negative, while two third is positive. From the \nother clusters (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6), none has more than one negative evaluation and this amounts \nto a maximum of 11% per cluster. As a conclusion we may state that all six clusters can be \nconsidered as \u201cgood\u201d practices, however for courses in cluster 3 with some more reservations \nthan for the other clusters. \nTable 4 shows the correlations of course evaluation with each of the five dimensions \nas revealed by MCA. Two of the five dimensions correlate significantly with course \nevaluation. Evaluations are more often positive on the \"language\" side of dimension \"2. \nMathematics versus language\" and on the \"lower\" side of dimension \"3. Bloom levels: lower \nversus higher\". \n------- \nInsert Table 4 about here \n----- \nThese findings correspond with the high proportion of negative evaluations found in \ncluster \"3. Left\", because that cluster is wholly on the \"academic\" side of that dimension. \nAlso, the fact that 14 of the 30 courses in this cluster have no assessment suggests why some \nof these transitional courses might be doing less well: it is likely that they ask too little \ncommitment from their participants. \nDiscussion \nThe  aim  of  this  research  was  to  address  how  teachers  design  and  implement  transitional  \ncourses using ICT and how teachers balance and integrate the various cognitive, pedagogical, \nsocial, organisational and technological course elements. In particular, we focused on \ndistilling these course elements in 118 educational scenarios used for transitional courses \nusing a multi-method approach. By means of a multiple correspondence analysis it is possible \nto answer the first research question. Five dimensions that together catch the main differences \nbetween transitional practices are identified and interpreted. Those dimensions are in \ndecreasing importance: 1) ICT: less versus more; 2) Mathematics versus language; 3) Lower \nversus higher Bloom levels; 4) Gamma sciences versus others; and 5) Very small group size \nversus others. Of all variation amongst the 68 variables included in the database, no less than \n47% could be explained by just five dimensions, which is remarkable given the heterogeneity \nof courses, cognitive contents, pedagogical approaches, ICT usages and the fact that \ncontributions came from 65 institutions from 22 countries. \nTwo of these dimensions (2 and 4) show strong relationships between content and \npedagogical choice. Courses in mathematics are characterised with individualised work \nforms, individualised course content and distance learning. Courses teaching a specific \nlanguage, on the contrary, are related to collaborative work forms, differentiated course \ncontent according to subgroup and face-to-face learning. As Crowe and Zand (2000) state, \nmathematics is inherently less verbal than other subjects and debate \u2013 and therefore \ncollaboration \u2013 plays a lesser role in mathematic courses than in other domains. Language \ncourses in se demand collaboration to a much greater extent than mathematics courses do, \nbecause speaking is an essential feature of learning a language. Two other dimensions show \nrelations between organisational context and pedagogy (3 and 5). For example, in the fifth \ndimension there is a relationship between very small group size and a collaborative work \nform.  \nDimension  (1)  summarises  the  strong  correspondence  amongst  the  majority  of  ICT  \nrelated variables, and the lack of correspondence of most of these with other aspects of \ncourses. In other words, ICT appears to be a pure factor in our multiple correspondence \nanalysis, which implies that the choice on how to use ICT (purpose, choice of tools, intensity, \netc.) in transitional education appears to be independent from other design decisions like \npedagogical approach or cognitive content. This is our first and most important finding in this \nstudy. An explanation why ICT related variables show so little relationship with other type of \nvariables is likely found in two supposed common causes: the teacher either love or hate ICT; \nand\/or local circumstances provide (in)sufficient support for ICT. Nonetheless, the fact that \nmost ICT related variables do not correspond with any of the content or pedagogical variables \nmay be a cause of concern.  \nMishra and Koehler (2006) argue that teachers should integrate their usage of \ntechnology when designing the cognitive content and pedagogy of the course. However, our \nfindings indicate that in practice teachers will combine all different types of choices for an \nICT tool with the choice for a particular content (e.g. mathematics, language), pedagogical \nchoice and learning setting (i.e. face-to-face, blended, distance) when delivering a transitional \ncourse. In other words, in contrast to the argumentation of Mishra and Koehler (2006) and \nother researchers that teachers are implementing ICT in their education depending on \naffordances of the tool, we find that ICT usage is not significantly related to pedagogical \napproach and content of a course. At the same time it is equally possible that each teacher has \na pedagogical reasoning for using a certain ICT tool for a certain course. However, if this is \nthe case, then the results of the course and ICT design implementations by teachers show \nlittle common patterns yet. In other words, there is little consensus on what tool to use in a \ngiven context. ICT-use now seems largely a matter of individual or institutional preference. If \nICT  continues  to  integrate  with  other  aspects  of  education,  then  we  expect  the  reasons  for  \nICT-variables to correlate among each other to become less (less love\/hate feelings, good \nsupport everywhere). At the same time, we expect the correlations of the ICT-variables with \ncontent and pedagogical variables to increase (indicating growing consensus about using tool \nX in context Y). As a conclusion, the disappearance of a single \"ICT\"-dimension should \nprobably be taken as a sign of growing integration of ICT.  \nThe six clusters found in the two-step clustering technique provide an answer to the \nsecond research question. These clusters show often-occurring combinations of content, \neducational decisions, use of ICT, and institutional context. Each cluster is to be regarded as a \ntested combination of design decisions, for given content and context. This is our second \nimportant finding. Teachers in different countries seem to design and implement fairly \nsimilar course designs when content, context and pedagogical approach are given.  \nWith this study we intended to address how teachers design and implement online and \nblended courses and how they combine content, context, organisation, pedagogical approach, \nassessment, ICT usage. Future research should address an in-depth qualitative approach to \nidentify  the  success-  and  fail  factors  within  each  of  the  six  clusters.  For  example,  by  using  \nfocus group discussions with the teachers within and across the six clusters, underlying \ndesign principles not included in our method can be uncovered. Finally, the validation of our \ndescriptive framework needs to be addressed. The fact that the low-dimensional model \nconsisting  of  only  five  dimensions  is  able  to  explain  47%  of  the  total  variation  of  the  68  \nvariables specifying the 118 educational scenarios indicates that our framework provides an \nadequate description of the main characteristics of relevant educational options. Furthermore, \ngiven that our dataset includes respondents from 65 institutes from 22 countries, this \nincreases the validity of our findings that teachers design fairly similar courses when the topic \nand pedagogical approach are known without specifically linking it to the possibilities, \npurposes or affordances of ICT. Finally, the absorption of all ICT-related factors in one \ndimension that is independent of all non-ICT related factors also implies that design decision \nwith regards to pedagogical approach, organisation, assessment, and so on appear to be stable \nconstructs. In other words: both within a paper and pencil context, and a high-tech context, \nsimilar design decision are taken by teachers offering transitional courses. Overall, our study \ncontributed to the debate how teachers design and implement effective interactive learning \nenvironments, whereby the specific discipline (mathematics, social science, language) and \npedagogical approach (collaborative, self-directed) seem to influence how teachers embed \nICT tools in their education.   \nAcknowledgments \nThe  authors  would  like  to  thank  the  EU  LLP  KA3  ICT  funding  the  S.T.E.P.  project  \n(http:\/\/www.transitionalstep.eu\/), which enabled this research project.
