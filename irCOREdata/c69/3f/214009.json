My current project, Civicweb: Young People, the Internet and Civic \nEngagement is no exception. Indeed, in the last two decades alone, hundreds of papers, books \nand reports in diverse fields have been written with the aim of delineating what civic participation \nshould be, why citizens in general and young people in particular are failing in terms of civic \nparticipation (particularly voting), and how these trends should be prevented. Meanwhile, other \nanalyses of this topic set out with the intention of challenging the orthodoxy and conclude by \nfinding in young people a vibrant stratum of the population that is outstripping older peers in \nterms of innovative democratic engagement. Acknowledging the recurrent fault lines between \ndifferent stances on young people and civic culture, Lance Bennett even writes of \u2018two different \nparadigms that contrast young citizens\u2026as either reasonably active and engaged or relatively \npassive and disengaged\u2019 (2008: 2). His carefully nuanced discussion proceeds in an attempt to \ndescribe and bridge the oppositions he has identified.  \n \nTaking its cue from some of the empirical and theoretical concerns outlined, but coming \nat the issues from a different angle, this article is speculative in outlook and aims to raise \nquestions with regard to three aspects of current discourse. Initially, drawing on the findings of \nmy recent research into youth civic activity represented on civic websites for the project \nCivicwebi, it aims to question both the notion that young people the least civically engaged \nsection of society regardless of context and the idea that they are outstripping older generations \nin the creativity and extent of their civic engagement online. Second, in the context of questions \nabout the necessary and actual relationships between civic engagement, action and political or \ngovernmental reaction in the wake of the 2003 UK and US-led attack on Iraq, it aims to \n 1\nproblematise the notion that voting in elections, support for a political party and trust in \ngovernment are always worthy indicators or young people\u2019s democratic civic engagement. And \nthird, but central to the whole article, the aim here is to raise questions about the idea that civic \nand political engagement and action are necessarily benign and democratic and hence always \ndesirable goals for young people. To historicise these discussions, the next section takes a brief \nand partial look some of the rhetorical trends with regard to citizenship and participation in the \nUK. \n \nFrom rights to duties: the civic imperative \n \n \nWhy has the idea of youth apathy and citizen disengagement been the focus of such \nattention in recent years? While, as Kathy Edwards (2007) points out, in discussions of trends in \nwestern democracies, young people are castigated for not turning out in huge numbers to vote, \nlow voter turnout is a phenomenon that affects other age-groups too and so cannot be the only \nexplanation. The notion of citizenship itself has a complex and individual history in the twentieth \ncentury in the UK, as in other countries, and as Ruth Lister explains (1998: 310-311), has tended \nto move in historical waves that establish different balances between individualistic and \ncommunitarian, rights based and duty led outlooks. The common thread between different \nwaves has been a reluctance to differentiate between the relationships of different categories or \ngroups of citizens to each other and to the state. This is the case even with trends in the 1990s, \nwhich saw New Labour attempting to bridge gaps between people\u2019s experiences of life in \ncommunities and their assumed aspirations for individual advancement: \u2018Tony Blair\u2019s first \nexposition of the meaning of socialism (or social-ism as he chose to recast it), on taking up the \nleadership of the party, set out his interpretation of the \u2018Left view of citizenship\u2019 and included \u2018the \nequal worth of each citizen\u2019 as one of the values of democratic socialism\u2019 (Lister 1998: 312). \nLister suggests, furthermore, that when it comes to a range of \u2018Big Ideas\u2019 supposedly offered by \nthe New Labour government in the 1990s, few were as embedded in the language of citizenship \nas that of \u2018community\u2019. Indeed, she notes that in referring to \u2018community\u2019 the vocabulary was one \nof \u2018responsibility and obligation\u2019. This, she argues, reflects the influence on New Labour: \n \nboth of popular communitarianism, as expounded by Amitai Etzioni and David Selbourne, \nand of a British tradition of ethical Christian socialism. It is an expression of what David \nMarquand (1996) has called \u2019a new kind of moral collectivism\u2019 on the centre-left\u2026The \n 2\nstatement of values, which replaced the totemic Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution, \noffers a new ideal of a \u2019community... where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe\u2019, \na formulation which implies that duties exist morally and logically prior to rights. This New \nLabour mantra echoes the deployment of the language of citizenship obligation by \nConservative ministers in the 1980s. It also reflects a more deep-rooted paradigm shift in \nwhich the discourse of citizenship draws increasingly upon the lexicon of obligations \nrather than rights. (Lister, 1998: 313) \n \nLister\u2019s article proceeds to examine discourses critical of the foregoing, and also the ways in \nwhich such communitarian rhetoric, whether in the UK or vis-\u00e0-vis Europe, might play out in \nterms of the citizen identities and day to day experiences of working women. We may surmise \nhere, however, how the gradually increasing orientation of public\/governmental discourses on \ncitizenship towards a notion of morally conscious citizens aware of their rights and shouldering \nthe duties that supposedly bind them together into communities might play out in relation to \ngroups such as young people.  \n \nLister\u2019s pithy overview provides a backdrop that more than predicts the ways in which the \nchoice to keep any sort of distance from those avowedly working to fulfil the vision of a united \ncommunity of Great Britain (or any other nation state with a similar recent history, for that matter) \nmight be interpreted as, or translated into, a rhetoric about disengagement, apathy and \ndepoliticisation. Quite evidently there are fewer people under the age of 25 in positions of power \nin government or with access to government than there are 26 to 60 year olds. Without a doubt \nthe dismantling of manufacturing industries (begun under the Thatcher Government, continued \nby successive Blair governments), the undermining of trade-unionism and the rights of public \nsector workers, and the failure of radical left politics to invite or convince a broad spectrum of the \nUK population have left a kind of vacuum in politics which means that there are no easily \navailable, inviting and evidently effective alternatives to established parties and politicians for \nyoung people to turn to. Indeed, a number of young people do express boredom or lack of \ninterest (Coleman 2005: 8), cynicism (Buckingham 2000) and\/or mistrust (Cushion 2007a) in \nrelation to politicians, political parties and government. Reminding us that young people\u2019s lives \nare crosscut by social factors, some middle and upper-middle class youth contributing \ncomments to the websites of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Conservative Party, \nthemselves subscribe to the sorts of individualist or communitarian rhetoric they have grown up \nhearing. In our recent report across six European countries and Turkey (Civicweb, deliverable \n 3\n6), the trend was for young people to be more suspicious of and unlikely to trust Government \nand formal politics than some older people and in some instances, there was a growing \ndisaffection from electoral politics in sections of the population other than but also including \nyouth. But does this add up to the kind of overwhelming lack of interest in a broader politics and \ncivil society that has frequently been attributed to them? The next section looks briefly at some \nof the ways in which UK youth appear to be engaging in the public sphere, especially as it is \nmanifested on the internet. \n \nUK youth, websites and the civic sphere  \n \nWhile the benevolent and democratic nature of civic participation is rarely questioned \n(see next section), in more recent academic writing there are more specific theoretical debates \nbeing played out about government, participation and the potentials or actual uses of new \ntechnologies for enhancing youth engagement. Montgomery et al (2004) and Dahlgren (2006, \n2007) have carried out fascinating descriptive studies which examine the particular uses young \npeople are making of civic websites in the US and Sweden respectively. Anita Harris (2004) \nsees flaws in traditional political participation as being as much about politicians and the \nestablishment as about the behaviour or values of young people and Stephen Coleman (2001, \n2005) uses young people\u2019s own responses to examine new technologies of mixing and digital \ncultures for methods of communicating politically that resonate with young people. Sonia \nLivingstone (Livingstone, Bober and Helsper, 2005) and Neil Selwyn (2007), meanwhile, \nexamine critically some minutiae of the digital civic and political communication occurring for \nyoung people on the internet, testing out hypotheses about changes in communication practices \nand social engagement wrought by technological changes. What these theorists share, however, \nis a concern that young people should be represented positively, or at least accurately and fairly \nin terms of their civic participation, whether it be on- or offline.  \n \nBased on a study of eighty UK civic websites and their associated organisations (sixty \npercent primarily youth orientated, forty percent more general in reach), groups or campaigns \nbetween January and August 2007, it becomes clear that people in the 15 to 25 age group are \nas keen to have their voices heard on a number of civic topics as their older peers and in some \ncases willing to give up significant amounts of time to campaigning. This supports evidence from \na number of reports, several commissioned by the Carnegie Young People\u2019s Initiative (2001; \nColeman and Rowe, 2005; Roker and Cox 2005). The environment, social discrimination, \n 4\nchildren\u2019s rights, war, terrorism, school and pedagogy, students\u2019 rights, employment and justice \nsystems, global corporations and campaigns for sustainable development, sexuality, eating \ndisorders, bullying and sexual abuse \u2013 are just some of the topics about which young people are \nengaging in heated debate and campaigning across this country. How they do this varies, just as \nthe funding models and pedagogies of the websites vary, and many of the campaigns have a \nprimarily offline civic action base \u2013 from local national and global meetings and networks both \nleft and right-leaning, demonstrations and lobbies of parliament to direct action in relation to \nanimal rights, human rights, pro and anti-hunting, strikes and pickets. But how do these activities \nlink up with more traditional forms of politics such as orientations towards government and \nvoting? \n \nInsert Figure 1: Head\u2019s Up Forum Page \n \nInsert Figure 2: B-Involved Home page \n \nA spectrum of views about the civic sphere and the political sphere as well as about civic \nand political action emerge from the civic websites and organisations surveyed. At one end are \nthose organisations that are comfortable with and\/or generally supportive of the (UK) \nGovernment as it runs at present, with the parliamentary system (in the UK) and with what they \nconsider to be the democratic institutions of this country, but can see opportunities to make \nthings run more effectively or more smoothly for some groups of people, notably young Black \npeople, young people in general and those from \u2018deprived\u2019 areas. For these sites, and especially \nthe ones aimed at youth, their role is to provide a platform and\/or the training and motivation for \nyoung people, who are seen to be cut off from formal politics to become interested in the \nparliamentary system, in voting in elections and in debating the views of politicians. Others \nsimply want to canvass support for a particular party. Slightly more radical sites in this category \nsee young people as being excluded by current debates and aim to increase politicians\u2019 \nawareness of and responsiveness to the views of youth. The Hansard Society\u2019s Head\u2019s Up site \n(See figure 1) typifies this approach. Some local government sites in this category take this \nslightly further by actually providing offline resources for youth and reasons for them to get \ninvolved in their communities (see figure 2). By the evidence of the sites themselves, however, \nthe numbers who actually take up this offer or to whom it is made available are small.  \n \n 5\nLocated centrally along the spectrum are websites belonging to organisations both for \nyouth and for a wider public which believe that while the ideal of elected parliamentary \ndemocracy is good, there are huge gaps between promises and what actually happens, with a \nnumber of people who are not even getting their basic human rights, let alone the full array of \nrights promised to British Citizens or Citizens of other democratic nations in the world. These \nsites invite the involvement of young people in campaigns against torture, for instance, or child \nlabour, and in doing so provide them with implicitly political information about the world and how \npower and the social order work (see figure 3). They also view it as necessary for civic and \npolitical participation to be premised on high levels of knowledge about and critique of both \nhistorical and current events, social practices and policies. Also centrally located on this civic-\npolitical spectrum are sites and organisations that pursue advocacy at the highest levels for \nparticular minority group rights but do not exhort young people to more widespread systemic \nsocial critique. \n \nINSERT Figure 3: British Youth Council Home \n \nFinally, there are a number of youth websites for organisations in whose rhetoric and \ninvitations to political activity clearly anti-state and anti-capitalist or occasionally ethnic \nsupremacist ideologies are at play. On these radical sites, civic participation for young people at \nits most basic level is perceived as a matter of the sceptical and critical decoding of mass media \n\u2018messages\u2019 and government rhetoric, running alternative media on or offline, leafleting and doing \ngraffiti, challenging prejudice and injustice or the democratic process itself by calling \ndemonstrations, sit-in, strikes, pickets, petitions, boycotts and discussion meetings. A small but \nsignificant number of radical sites view the foregoing actions as part of traditional politics and \nadvocate in addition \u2018direct-action\u2019, which might be anything from repeatedly breaking \u2018unjust\u2019 \ncopyright legislation by file-sharing, using only \u2018free\u2019 software, heckling parliamentarians, \nchaining wheelchairs to disabled-unfriendly thoroughfares, lying down in the road in front of army \nbases, releasing animals destined for slaughterhouses, beating up Pakistani shop keepers, or \npreventing animal testing facilities from carrying out their work, doing homophobic graffiti or \nphysically preventing the hunting of animals. Clearly not all of these actions are comparable and \nsome are not in the least democratic; nevertheless their advocates on the sites view them as \ncivic or political action. Unusually for the online left groups, the British Antifascist Network \nimplicitly makes violent action against neo-Nazis and Far Right cadre (\u2018Bash the Fash\u2019) a clear \naspect of civic\/political action. Evangelical Christian youth groups meanwhile invite users to get \n 6\n\u2018sports\u2019 contests\u2019 and \u2018arts or drama\u2019 activities going with youth in \u2018deprived areas\u2019, and to have \n\u2018clinics\u2019 which will try to solve youth problems, but always with the codicil that these activities will \nbe used as a means of \u2018spreading God\u2019s word\u2019 and \u2018bringing Jesus\u2019 to those who need him.  \n \nWhile rhetoric and pedagogy may differ between youth led and more established \norganisations run by older adults, in the online civic sphere surveyed here and the offline civic \nsphere it frequently represents, young people in the UK appear to match older peers in terms of \na desire to communicate, research, debate, inform, suggest ideas, raise funds, protest and \nvolunteer their time to particular causes and actions. The dominant tone in writing about young \npeople and civic engagement across different fields including that of participation and new \ntechnologies, however, continues to be one that sees civic engagement under any \ncircumstances as an unquestionable good, civic action as even better and almost as a logical \ncorollary, young people as being troublingly in deficit when it comes to civic participation \n(Putnam 2000, Coughlan 2003, Galston 2004). But, if what is being suggested by research \nabout young people and civil society is that all that is needed are further action and engagement \nby young people or if all politicians have to do to engage young people is alter their political \ncommunication style, then real problems with democracy and civic culture are probably falling \nthrough the cracks unnoticed. The next section takes the case of the UK protests over the attack \non Iraq in 2003 suggests that making young people\u2019s assumed lack of interest\/engagement out \nto be one of the biggest problems faced by democracies might be a dangerous precedent for the \nvery democracies such arguments hope to infuse with new life. \n \nHealthy democracy or destructive realpolitik: young citizens versus the state \n \nMore than adults, young people seem intuitively to recognize that our political system is broken. \nAnd they register their awareness on Election Day by not bothering to participate in what to them \nis a pretty meaningless exercise. So when you see the low numbers for voter turnout this time, \ndon't think of it as apathy. Think of it as the wisdom of youth. (Hill and Robinson, 2002)  \n \nEven if it is the case that those who suggest that all engagement and action are 'good' \nthings are envisaging 'benevolent' action and 'pro-social' or 'pro-democratic' engagement, there \nare plenty of examples of political or civic outcomes that have conflicting and potentially \nundemocratic overtones for some people while being unquestionably democratic to others. Let \nus take what happened over the Iraq war as a case in point as it 'engaged' record numbers of \n 7\npeople, and young people amongst them (Cushion 2004, 2007 and 2007a). While the sense of \nanger and frustration about an impending unjust and illegal invasion of another country that led \nsome two million people to protest not once but repeatedly at various locations across the UK \nfrom February 2003 onwards only deepened over the course of the following months, the sense \nof political efficacy engendered by these collective actions was short-lived. In fact, there is \nanecdotal evidence that various groups and individuals became increasingly disenchanted by \nboth the official sanctions taken against them as groups or individuals for their actions and by \nthe long-term effects of the government\u2019s propaganda and lack of responsiveness to the \narguments and actions against a war (Noor 2007; Al-Ghabban 2007; Cushion 2007a).  \n \nOf the young people who 'chose' to take civic action by walking out of schools during \nlessons, or colleges during lectures \u2013 and there were some ten thousand of these in London \nalone on the day that the Blair government alongside US allies began the attack on Iraq \u2013 many \nfound themselves facing exceptionally serious and authoritarian consequences the following day \nand even on the day of the invasion itself (Cushion 2004; Al-Ghabban 2004). Some schools \nlocked their gates; others sent warning letters home to parents preceding the events and yet \nothers carried out exclusions or suspensions following the events. The activist charity The \nWoodcraft Folk even suspected that it had its funding withdrawn because of its anti-war stance. \nOf the young people and adults who chose to write letters to their MPs, many received formal \nreplies stating the Government\u2019s position on Weapon\u2019s of Mass Destruction at the time, or a \nformulaic note directing them to the text of a speech by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair \njustifying military action against Iraq. This clearly did not constitute reciprocal engagement on the \npart of the MPs but a standardized and bureaucratic response that curtailed debate. Worse still, \na media environment seemingly supportive of young people\u2019s interest in the developing \ninternational situation prior to the attack on Iraq, became increasingly strident in its caricatures of \nthe efforts of young citizens to oppose their government following the attack on Iraq. As Stephen \nCushion notes, \u2018the dominant media frame shifted, once the war had commenced, with young \nprotestors portrayed as opportunistic truants rather than (as pre-war) active, engaged citizens\u2019 \n(2007: abstract). \n \nHowever, some would clearly argue that such (apparent) 'debate' over what is and is not \nallowable civic action, and what should or should not be a political path of action, strengthens a \ndemocracy. Yet, none of the actions mentioned prevented the military destruction of dozens of \nIraqi cities, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who would not otherwise have \n 8\ndied, the destruction of whatever nominal law and order existed in Iraq or the absolute \ndestruction of Iraqi civil society so that now 'might is right' at a very visceral everyday level. \nIndeed, the sum total of civic actions taken and engagements founded in the UK around the Iraq \nwar were ineffective when weighed in the balance against the reaction of government and the \nconsequences of violent military intervention in the civic life of Iraq.  \n \nThis is absolutely not to assert that the civic\/political protests should not have happened \nor that the kind of campaigning experience they gave young people in the UK was not useful. \nProtests that are not listened to are most evidently still civic and as such still play a role in a \ndemocracy. Nor is this an argument suggesting that all governments should change \ndemocratically decided policies based solely on strong public sentiments. I merely suggest that, \nthat in some contexts, relatively mild forms of civic action \u2013 and in this I include demonstrating \nand writing letters \u2013 which are tolerated by the authorities in most so-called democratic regimes, \nmay sometimes serve to mask persistent injustice and inequality, or abuses of power. To be \nmore specific, if these civic actions run counter to the wishes of the regime in power, and if \nyoung people or others participating in civic protest are arguing that the actions of that regime be \nrethought, curtailed or prevented entirely, (as was the case with many of the protests that \nerupted or were planned to attempt to prevent the attack on Iraq in 2003), they are often \nineffective.  \n \n So, what role did the anti-Iraq war protests, particularly the contribution of young people, \nplay? Did they limit the options open to the then Government in terms of the military aid it would \nrender the US? Possibly, although it is difficult to imagine how much more aggressively involved \nthe UK could have been in attacking Iraq. Did the civic protests cause the British Press to \nrepresent the plight of Iraqi civilians in a more balanced and humane manner? At times, I \nsuggest, it is also possible that the incontrovertibly civic debates and actions taking place also \nserved to strengthen the opinion that the UK establishment (and many of its more privileged \ncitizens) has of the UK as a particularly open democracy compared to other places where, they \nargue, citizens are not allowed to demonstrate, complain about the government in newspaper \narticles or to write letters to elected Members of Parliament. Meanwhile, real problems with this \nparticular democracy are passing mostly unchallenged (Cushion 2007a). Spontaneous cross-\nunion strikes and pickets have been banned in this country, and many people have even \nforgotten that they once had the right and that it was a right someone had to fight for. Services \nthat people once took for granted as being free and available to all \u2013 dental care, higher \n 9\neducation \u2013 have been dismantled and\/or privatized; in the UK universal free and equal school \neducation, long fought for, scarcely appreciated might soon be a thing of the past; the right to \nsilence and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty are already under threat if you \nhappen to be an ethnic minority citizen picked up in the wake of a terrorist attack or even the \nsuggestion of one.  \n \nCivic debate whether in the media or otherwise can encourage but never take the place \nof really responsive government. And as even local government research agrees (Nicholson \n2005), even this civic debate is not taking place, so to speak, on a level playing field. For any \ncivic actions or debates to be effective at preventing actions that one side does not wish to \noccur, there cannot be huge and unbridgeable inequalities in power.  Nor are all forms of civic \nparticipation equally palatable to the governments who preach about it. Denying the importance \nof power relations between different groups of people, and the people and the state in \ndemocracies, when urging young people to become \u2018engaged\u2019 may actually be dangerous for \ndemocracy and demoralising for young people. Westheimer and Kahne make this argument \nparticularly poignantly in their article on the meaning of citizenship: \n \nthose visions of obedience and patriotism that are often and increasingly associated with \nthis agenda can be at odds with democratic goals. And even the widely accepted goals \nfostering honesty, good neighborliness, and so on, are not inherently about democracy. \nIndeed, government leaders in a totalitarian regime would be as delighted as leaders in a \ndemocracy if their young citizens learned the lessons put forward by many of the \nproponents of personally responsible citizenship: don\u2019t do drugs; show up to school; \nshow up to work; give blood; help others during a flood; recycle; pick up litter; clean up a \npark; treat old people with respect. These are desirable traits for people living in a \ncommunity. But they are not about democratic citizenship. To the extent that emphases \non these character traits detract from other important democratic priorities, they may \nactually hinder rather than make possible democratic participation and change. For \nexample, a focus on loyalty or obedience (common components of character education \nas well) works against the kind of critical reflection and action many assume are essential \nin a democratic society.' (2006: 6-7) \n \nIt is hard to miss the links between the type of \u2018personally responsible citizenship\u2019 described here \nand the Blairite communitarianism thrust upon citizens by New Labour rhetoric.  Westheimer and \n 10\nKahn\u2019s warnings about where the logic of such depoliticised dutiful citizenship might lead are \nstark. Yet stronger forms of citizen action, such as: spontaneous general strikes, which are not \nmanipulated by corrupt union officials; the occupation of government or educational spaces; \nmass walk-outs and sit-ins; civil disobedience such as extended mass non-payment of taxes; or \nas in France in response to poverty, unemployment and racist policy, the burning of cars and the \nsmashing of property such as shops, are vilified, often refused the label of 'civic' even by liberals, \nand treated with huge and disproportionately authoritarian responses by so-called democratic \nstates.  \n \nCivic engagement \u2013 at any cost? \n \nIn much of the literature about youth and politics, civic action and citizenship education \nthere is an assumption that civic action, whether technological or otherwise, is better than no \naction and that 'civic' engagement is better than no engagement. But, however honourable and \ndemocratic the intentions of those suggesting this, is this categorically the case? Should we call \nfor civic action and engagement on the part of young people as a certain good?  \n \nFirst of all, there are semantic and moral definitions and assumptions yoked to the notion \nthat civic action is a certain good. Action is better than passivity. Better for the young person or \ncitizen and better for the demos or public and better hence for the nation and the world. Second, \nthere are assumptions being made about the benevolence of civic engagement and action in \nterms of its link to democracy: in fact, civic action appears, even in sophisticated writing on this \ntopic (Montgomery et al 2004; Dahlgren 2007), to be linked to the notion of democracy so that \nthe two are almost interchangeable: Dahlgren, Miegel and Olson (2007) write that: \n \nIf we juxtapose \u2018civic\u2019 with \u2018political\u2019, we propose the following distinction, based on a loosely \nrepublican orientation: \u2018civic\u2019 resonates with civil society, in the sense of the social terrain that \nis public, shared, and outside the state and the corporate world. Further, it embodies a sense \nof the \u2018public good\u2019: a fundamental element of citizenship is thus a sense of service, of \naltruistic contribution (cf. the rhetoric of graduation speeches, admonishing contributions to the \ngeneral welfare). The \u2018political\u2019, however, is more specific: it points to the conflicts of interest \nthat arise on the civic terrain, and the resultant antagonisms. The major raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \ndemocracy can be said to be that it offers ways to resolve such conflicts in a manner that is \njust, binding, and nonviolent. (2007: 10) \n 11\n Ergo, in this definition, actions in the public sphere that arise out of far right ideologies or to \nfurther extreme authoritarian or inegalitarian causes are not counted as Civic. In fact they are \ndistinctly uncivic. Following this logic, Kathryn Montgomery and her colleagues, whose seminal \nreport Engaging the Digital Generation has been influential in challenging ideas about young \npeople\u2019s lack of civic and political efficacy in the United States write: \n \nOur use of the term 'civic' refers to this public realm and the whole body or community of \ncitizens. It focuses on the active participation by community members in the exercise of public \nauthority, the rights and responsibilities of community members, and the ways they work with \none another as well as the ways they relate to government\u2026. Finally, our definition of civic \nactivity encompasses the notion of the public good, which is expressed by the National Civic \nLeague in the following terms: The end result of a community\u2019s civic education activities \nshould be to engender within the community\u2019s residents a commitment to participating in the \nbetterment of that community. [This] must also include an attachment to justice, a willingness \nto serve beyond self-interest, an openness to all those who share the rank of citizen and a \nperspective that reaches beyond the generation living to those unborn. Thus the notion of the \npublic good implies a commitment to justice and to the rights of those who are marginalized. \nActivities that are designed to harm, diminish, or exclude others, or deprive them of their \nrights, are not civic activities, even when conducted in the public realm by groups of active \ncitizens. (2004: 17-18). \n \nBut in what way does this definition \u2013 which yokes together benevolent moral intentions, pro-\ndemocratic outcomes and collective intervention in the public sphere \u2013 help us to understand the \nways in which, and the reasons for which, a diverse spectrum of people become involved in \npolitics and the civic sphere? Can everyone who gets involved be doing so because of a \ncommitment to and with the same understanding of the \u2018public good\u2019?  \n \nThis discussion too seems to turn on a strong presumption about national systems that \nare named \u2018democracies\u2019: namely the notion that all civic action and political mobilisation in a \ncountry that allows voting and calls itself a democracy is democratic. But this may not tally with \neveryone\u2019s experience of life even in a supposedly highly developed democratic country like the \nUK. Indeed, realising the amount of discontent with current manifestations of democratic \ngovernment, whether just or unjust, numerous rightwing and sectarian organisations across the \n 12\nglobe are capitalising on young people\u2019s desire for an alternative. In the following section I \nexamine an example of a wide-spread civic movement involving youth in India that takes as its \nfundamental premise a set of ideas that is deeply antithetical to democracy.  \n \nAcknowledging rightwing civic activism \n \nThe far-right Hindu chauvinist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) started in India in \nthe 1930s and boasts a large number of high-ranking government officials; it has overt links to \nIndia\u2019s powerful extremist Hindu political party the BJP which ruled India during the 1990s and is \nstill in power across numerous states. The RSS has a long and well documented (Sarkar 1993, \nAgarwal 2001,Bhatt 2002) history of xenophobia against Christian and Muslim minorities in India \nand elsewhere, as well as a history of \u2018civic\u2019 campaigns against Pakistan and Bangladesh as \nwell as Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants in India. It boasts hundreds of cadre groups of \nyoung men and some young women across the country and several larger bodies linked to the \nWorld Hindu Organisation, which is a large proto-fascist upper caste Hindu organization with \nmembership across the globe. Ideologues of both these organizations write and talk about their \nadmiration for Hitler and Mussolini, the perspicacity of these leaders in realizing that part of the \npopulation constituted an \u2018enemy within\u2019, the example set to all Hindus by the ideologue and \nassassin Nathuram Godse who shot Mahatma Gandhi. Reading any of this, it would be difficult \nto think of reasons for calling this organisation or chain of groups civic. \n \nOn the ground, however, things are more complicated. The RSS run the equivalent of \ncamps or training clubs for young \u2018volunteers\u2019. They practice martial arts and listen to speeches \nand sermons about pure Indian blood, mind body and spirit and social work. They undertake \nlocal activities encouraging literacy for rural children and the rebuilding of defunct spaces to \nserve the \u2018community\u2019 \u2013 obviously a community delimited by religion and caste, but nevertheless \ncovering a huge area and number of people. Not all of those who enter the RSS do so for \n\u2018uncivic\u2019 motives (Banerjee, 2003). Many insist that they are doing so to \u2018help their community\u2019 \n(defined as Indians or Hindus); and to help their motherland\/nation \u2013 India. They have strict \ntraining programmes of physical fitness and exercise; and a strong regime of obedience and \ndiscipline. These youth do not get into trouble with their parents; and are often highly motivated \nat school and in community work. In every piece of literature about themselves and in discussion \nwith members, the RSS describes itself as a civic and cultural and not a political organization. \n 13\nAgain it similarities with Westheimer and Kahne\u2019s responsible and dutiful citizen become \napparent. \n \nSupported by nationalist and communitarian rhetoric on blogs and websites made by \nyoung sympathisers, these organizations have collected hundreds of thousands of dollars each \nyear from primarily young non-resident Indians to support India\u2019s aggressive anti-Pakistan \nstance and its nuclear programme. Despite court orders and legal challenges, in the course of \nthe late 1990s and the following decade, thousands of young volunteers from the RSS have \nphysically taken part in demolishing not just large and famous mosques all over India such as \nthe Babri Masjid at Ayodhya, but also hundreds of small Muslim and Christian shrines and \nchurches and thousands of Muslim dwellings and shops; they have lobbied for and achieved a \nre-writing of history text books to demonise pre-twentieth century Islamic rulers of India as well \nas to exclude and excise Muslims and Christians from the Indian Freedom Struggle; their plan to \nhave astrology on the national curriculum in India at university level was narrowly averted only \nby a change of government.  \n \nAt a more militant and more sinister level, they have participated in documented vicious \nanti-Muslim pogroms \u2013 either inciting or participating in raping and murdering Muslim men, \nwomen and their children; Hindu women married to Muslim men and defacing, torturing and \nmurdering Muslim men or those who sheltered Muslims in Gujarat as recently as 2002 (Anand \nand Setalwad, 2002; Anand and Setalwad 2002). RSS women cadre are known for supporting \nmale cadre in raping and murdering Muslim women and children and for lying to protect them \nfrom prosecution (Banerjee 2002). In testimonies gathered by researchers and Human Rights \norganisations, both male and female cadre, who are generally young, see themselves as \nsoldiers or fighters for the purity of their religion and nation. For students of History, there are \nclear parallels with the Hitler Youth. \n \nThe producer of one youth civic website in London stated that for him civic or political \nactions were simply \u2018people trying to change the world to make it more like a place they wanted \nto live in\u2019.  In tune with this view, Christian fundamentalist youth in the US, young skin-heads in \nthe UK and the far more diverse and powerful RSS youth in India believe in a highly stratified, \nracially or religiously purified world and take actions to bring about this society. Refusing to see \nsome of the actions taken by RSS cadre as civic because one is repulsed by their ideological \nchauvinism and authoritarian philosophy as well as by other actions taken in support of this \n 14\nideology, makes it more difficult to understand why they have hundreds of thousands of young \nsupporters or to explain their appeal in a specific place at a given historical moment. An inability \nto answer questions about the appeal of some organizations that involve youth in politics of \nwhatever hue weakens rather than strengthens any case being made for democratic and civic \naction on the part of youth.  \n \nI suggest then that, it is plausible to view civic engagement as never being just about \nidealistic or altruistic association with voluntary associations and activities for their own sake. \nThere are all kinds of other emotional and ideological appeals which constantly surround civic \naction, and these appeals are neither innately benevolent nor innately to be condemned for \ndiluting a field of \u2018pure\u2019 civic endeavour. Ziad Munson\u2019s thoughtful study of pro-life movements \nand the young people who join them on college campuses in the United States (2007) outlines \njust a few of the ways in which life cycle transitions, social networks, the actual presence of \nrightwing groups in the midst of student bodies and a variety of cross-cutting emotional \ninvestments are all parts of the process by which youth are mobilized into pro-life activities \nwithout prior ideological commitments to an anti-abortion stance. Additionally, Munson\u2019s study \nquestions the traditional linkage both within and outside academia of college campuses with the \nnotion of liberal social activism. Although we may stipulate as many normative democratic \ndefinitions as we wish, just as with political beliefs and actions, real as opposed to theoretical \ncivic action bears little necessary connection with democratic or liberal values. \n \nConclusion: Learning from history and theory \n \nThe urge towards and the motivation for civic action can be traced in the contours of \nyoung people\u2019s life experiences, the ideologies they encounter and abide by, their social \ncontexts, neighbourhoods and political encounters as well as their emotional commitments and \nloyalties be these race or religion, football, music, nation or local neighbourhood. Young people \nare not monolithic and they are certainly not utterly different from older adults; they are a \ncategory crosscut by ethnicity, gender, class, race and religion, as well as disability and \nsexuality. They have as many or few and as varied or as circumscribed opinions about their lives \nand their cultural circumstances as older adults. While this may seem a trite point, as Sanchez-\nJankowski (2002) suggests  it is surprisingly often ignored or side-stepped in calls for young \npeople to become more civically and politically active. Studies of underprivileged ethnic minority \nyouth\u2019s civic and political engagements in the United States (Sanchez-Jankowski 2002, Kishner, \n 15\nStrobel and Fernandez, 2003) and in the UK (Al-Ghabban 2007; Noor, 2007) confirm that for \nsome citizens in these democratic countries, civic engagement is predicated on complex and \nangry critique of the way in which their supposed representatives in the Senate or Parliament \nactually regard people like them. Additionally, these critiques can have different outcomes for \ndifferent individuals and different groups, leading some to find solutions and take action on \ncommonly perceived problems and leading others to do little or to participate in socially \ndestructive actions.  \n \nOverwhelmingly in the global literature aimed at teaching young people and children civic \nvalues, there is an emphasis on conformity rather than on critique, confrontation or challenge; in \nthe UK there is also an emphasis on speaking and writing in particular ways that abide by the \nrules and norms set by a ruling elite who show little willingness to alter policies just because \ncitizens do not agree with them. While there is certainly a need to avoid crass populism in \nGovernment, what if anything is the point of participation that is never going to achieve \nanything? At some level, civic participation and engagement begin to look like instrumental \njustifications for citizenship of a particular country \u2013 somewhat like a licence fee \u2013 rather than \nsigns of citizen\u2019s political agency, maturity or power. And the requirement to participate, when \nviewed in this light, again begins to look particularly unappealing from the point of view of young \npeople.  \n \nI end by asking a series of questions that those of us interested in youth, citizenship and \ncivic action would do well to consider. First, would we want to endorse politics per se, any \npolitics, however rightwing or authoritarian or violent, as being better than no politics or apathy, \nmistrust, scepticism or cynicism? Indeed: Is reactionary civic involvement better than no \ninvolvement? Clearly some of the examples provided in this article would suggest that, at least in \nthe author\u2019s view, the answer to both these questions is no.  \n \nSecond, how is democracy strengthened by defining civic action as de facto benign, \naltruistic and democratic? If there is never just a single \u2018public\u2019 in any nation state for whom one \ncan define a notion of \u2018the public good\u2019 and on whose behalf all civic actions are urged and \ntaken, again, at least in my view there might be more danger in refusing to acknowledge that \nrightwing\/authoritarian activism are civic than there is in accepting the term civic as being \ncomposed of a spectrum from authoritarian and reactionary to libertarian and democratic. The \nlatter strategy is understandably more time-consuming at the outset as one cannot invoke a \n 16\nnotion of democratic participation and action merely by championing civic engagement. \nHowever, I believe that in the long run it will be beneficial both to young people, in that it will be \nevident that certain kinds of collective action and engagement are worse than mere introversion \nor individualism, and to those trying to foster democratic engagement, as the affective and \ncognitive pulls of authoritarian and sectarian civic action are better understood and countered.  \n \nThus finally, and in a way echoing Lance Bennet\u2019s question (2008: 20) about how \u2018to \nnurture the creative and expressive actions of a generation in change, while continuing to keep \nsome positive engagement with government\u2019, it is worth asking how, if at all, is it possible to \nprevent the discovery that some politicians and governments are corrupt and\/or unresponsive to \ncitizens\u2019 civic and political opinions and action from making young people choose apathetic \nacceptance or even rightwing civic activism over democratic civic action? Democracy in most \ncountries does not live up to its ideal form but needs to be held accountable by a range of \npeople within a country before its claims can be judged and I, like many of the other authors \nquoted in this article, have no desire to see young people give up on this task before they have \nbegun.  \n \n \nNotes \n \n                                                 \n \ni Civicweb: Young people, the internet and civic participation, www.civicweb.eu, (2006-2009) is a \nproject funded by the European Union and currently underway in seven European countries \nincluding the UK. \ni Who\u2019s a young person?
