Silva \nAdvanced Technology Insfifufe, School ofElecfronics andphysical Sciences, Universitj of Surrey, \nGuildford GU2 7m United Kingdom \nThe electron emission process modelled using Fowler-Nordheim theory gives accurate \nestimates of the emission current when applied to metal. However, when applied to thin \nfilm amorphous semiconductors, unexpectedly low effective bamers (@) or extremely \nhigh field enhancement factors (p) result. To explain the anomalously high p values seen \nexperimentally in amorphous semiconductors two possible sources for field enhancement \ncan be identified; (1) Surface protrusions on the material surface that results in a high \ngeometric enhancement, and (2) Internal field enhancement in the thin films by having \nconductive regions within an insulating matrix. \nIn this article, we report on the modelling performed using Silvaco, Atlas device \nsimulation, where we propose a new kind of enhancement mechanism within the FE \nprocess in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). This model is equally applicable to \nall disordered and nano-crystalline materials. In particular, internal field enhancement \nwhere a conductive region is embedded in an insulating matrix. The simulation setup is \nshown in Figure 1 (a) with a 0.1 pm thick a-Si:H film on a highly doped silicon substrate \nand a vacuum gap is 0.5 pm for the unmodified control sample. Figure 1 (b) shows the \nsetup where a conductive filament of 10 nm in diameter is incorporated into the bulk a- \nSi:H thin film. \nSimulations were performed to investigate the role of \u201chot\u201d electrons in the process of \nfield emission from a-Si:H. A conductive filament is included in the thin film, and \nimprovements in the emission current were observed in the \u2018hot\u2019 electron injection region \nof the current versus electric field data. This allows the required electric field for \nemission to be observed at around 8V\/pm. The mechanism that triggers such a \n0-7803-8397-4\/04\/$20.00 2004 IEEE 76 \nphenomenon will he explained in term of a \u201cworm-hole\u2019\u2019 effect observed in the internal \nelectric field contained within the buk a-Si:H thin film. \nWhen examining the electric field lines and their strengths in the vicinity of the \nconductive filament, it is apparent that there is not only an electric field perpendicular to \nthe filament, but also a high electric field parallel to the conductive filament. This lateral \nfield acts as a \u2018\u2018worm hole\u201d to suck free electrons close to the filament towards it, which \nthen get emitted to the positively biased anode via a transfer of momentum perpendicular \nto the electric field. We will support our preliminary data on simulation with \nexperimental results. \nDr. C H P Poa \nAdvanced Technology Institute, School of Electronics and Physical Sciences, University \nof Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, United Kingdom \nTel: 4414876099 \nFax: 441483689404 \nE-mail Patrick.Doa@,eim.surrev.ac.uk \n0-7803-8397-4\/04\/$20.00 2004 IEEE 77 \n"}
