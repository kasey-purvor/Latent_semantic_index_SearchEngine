Preparedness for occupational change is \ndefined as the wish to acquire higher task demands (i.e. greater complexity) in the sense that \nemployees have thought about change but have not yet acted to seek change. It explained why \npreparedness for occupational change is central prior to, during, and after organizational change is \nintroduced. A model of determinants of preparedness for occupational change is established. The \napplication of this model in different stages of organizational change is demonstrated. Central \naspects in this model are self-efficacy and leadership. Self-efficacy influences preparedness for \noccupational change in the different stages. This effect is demonstrated using the three assumed \noutcomes of self-efficacy (i.e., initiation of behavior, persistence, and effort) and their relationship \nto preparedness for occupational change. It is assumed that perceived leadership influences \noccupational self-efficacy. Three factors influencing self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious \nlearning, and verbal persuasion) are regarded as possibly being responsible for this effect. The \nimplications of the model for organizational practice are discussed. \nKeywords: Preparedness for Occupational Change, Organizational change, Self-efficacy, \nLeadership \nThe Influence of Occupational Self-Efficacy on the Relationship of Leadership Behavior and \nPreparedness for Occupational Change \n \nMore and more employees are confronted with changing task demands due to organizational \nchange processes. In this context, Hesketh (2001) invited scientists to deal with organizational \nchange and its influence on personal career management. Organizational change can involve the \nintroduction of new technologies as well as changing organizational structure, for example when \nlevels of hierarchy are reduced, that is, a the flattening of hierarchies takes place. These changes \noften include changes in employees\u2019 tasks. When new technologies are introduced, employees have \nto learn how to handle them either through (formal) qualification or through learning on the task. \nTasks also often change in the case of the flattening of hierarchies. In some cases tasks of \nsupervisors become part of the subordinates\u2019 tasks.  \nSome studies on organizational change concentrated on how supervisors adapt to \norganizational change processes (see Armenakis, Harris, & Field, 1999; Bloom & Sheerer, 1992; \nJudge, Thoresen, Pucik, & Welbourne,1999), others focussed on employees\u2019 adaptation to \nrelocation (Eby & Russell, 2000; Landau, Shamir, & Arthur, 1992; Noe & Barber, 1993). In this \npaper emphasis is put on the employees\u2019 side in organizational change processes, especially on the \nchanging of tasks. The aspect of relocation is not addressed here. Priority is placed on the \nemployees\u2019 tasks.  \nIn general, three main areas of occupational change can be differentiated: Organizational \nchange, job change, and task change. Organizational change refers to the restructuring of the whole \norganization (for example as reactions to radical environmental change, see Audia, Locke, & Smith, \n2000). Job change (e.g. Ostroff & Clark, 2001) implies a change for the employee (which \u2013 of \ncourse \u2013 can also occur in organizational change processes) such as relocation, lateral change, career \nchange. Task change refers to a change in task demands. Theses changes can be accompanied by \norganizational or job change but can also occur as a reaction to the introduction of new \ntechnologies. Task change can thus include job change, but not necessarily so.  \nThe latter case is addressed in this paper or - more precisely - the task is the focus of this \npaper in so far as it might change due to organizational change processes. Preparedness for \noccupational change is defined in this paper as the wish to acquire higher task demands (i.e. greater \ncomplexity) in the sense that employees have thought about change but have not yet acted to seek \nchange (for a detailed definition see below). The extent to which organizational change implies a \nchange of location or job change (such as lateral change or promotion) is not taken into account. \nWhen organizational change processes take place, organizations need employees willing to \ntake over new tasks. For the employees, preparedness for occupational change can be crucial, as \nemployees not willing to adapt to change may lose their jobs in organizational change processes. \nAs preparedness for occupational change is therefore crucial in organizational change \nprocesses the questions arises as to which personal and organizational requirement are preconditions \nfor employees\u2019 preparedness for occupational change. With respect to employees\u2019 characteristics, it \nseems that self-efficacy, that is the conviction that one can successfully execute a given behaviour \nrequired to produce certain outcomes (Bandura, 1977a, p. 193), plays an important role for \nemployees in the process of organizational change. McDonald and Siegall (1992, 1996) examined \nthe role of self-efficacy in reactions to technological change. Their results indicate that employees\u2019 \nself-efficacy influences their adaptation to organizational change, as explained in more detailed \nbelow. \nOrganizations also need employees who might function as change agents. In change \nprocesses, supervisors who show preparedness for occupational change can serve as role models and \ncan encourage their subordinates by assuring them that they will be able to cope with the changes. \nThis behavior on the leaders\u2019 side leads to followers\u2019 self-efficacy as will be explained in more \ndetail below. In essence, leaders can support their employees in change processes. Thus, leadership \nis important in organizational change processes. These considerations lead to a model that explains \nthe role of leadership and self-efficacy in the process of the development of preparedness for \noccupational change in organizational change processes. This model can be helpful for \norganizations by offering suggestions as to what to do to support preparedness for occupational \nchange. \nBefore explaining the relationship between preparedness for occupational change, self-\nefficacy, and leadership, the definition of preparedness for occupational change used throughout this \npaper will be introduced. Prior to the discussion and the implications for future research, the \ntheoretical framework is further explained by establishing a model of self-efficacy and leadership as \ndeterminants of preparedness for occupational change. \nPreparedness for occupational change \nOrganizational change processes influence employees tasks in different ways. The case \nwhere organizational change processes lead to higher task demands for the employees concerned is \nconcentrated on. Higher task demands are defined in line with the action core theory (for an \noverview see Frese & Zapf, 1994) as task characteristics that require more action regulation on the \npart of the employee. The necessity to take on tasks with higher task demands than the previous task \narises when supervisor tasks are integrated in the task of a former subordinate. If for example an \nemployee has constructed printers out of material given to him \/ her by the supervisor before the \norganizational change process and is now -additionally - responsible for the flow of material this \nimplies that he \/ she has to think about which material is needed at a certain point of time. \nTherefore, the employee has to cope with higher task demands. New technologies are sometimes \nconnected with higher task demands, as well. In some cases computer programming knowledge is \nneeded after organizational change where a mechanical set up of machines was possible before. \nPreparedness for occupational change is thus defined as the wish to take over a task with higher task \ndemands (in the sense explained above) than those that existed in the previous task. This definition \nas a \u201cwish\u201d is understood in the sense of the transtheoretical model of Prochaska and DiClemente \n(1983) as a contemplation state: Employees think about change but have not yet taken action with \nrespect to initiating change\n1\n. \nPreparedness for occupational change is relevant in three stages of organizational change: (a) \nprior to change, (b) during change, and (c) after change.  \n(a) Qualifications might be necessary prior to changes so that when the changes are introduced the \nemployees are already prepared (e.g. through qualification). Furthermore, fast changing \norganizations might need employees who seek changes for themselves, for example through \nlearning new tasks, through proactive behavior (Deci, Connell, & Ryan, 1989), or through initiative \n(Frese, 2001). Whereas learning a new task is independent of one\u2019s present job or profession, \ninitiative is defined as the development of new goals and self-determined actions and has to be \ncongruent with the goals of a company (Frese, Fay, Hilburger, Leng, and Tag, 1997). Proactive is \nthe stable tendency of a person to seek change in his \/ her environment and is regarded as a \ndisposition (Bateman & Crant, 1993). \n(b) In the midst of the process of change, organizations need change agents \u2013 that is, employees who \nconvince others of the necessity and the positive aspects of the change. In addition, they need \nemployees who are willing to accept new tasks. \n(c) After the changes have been introduced, organizations need employees who are willing to cope \nwith those changes and adapt to them in a way that is constructive for the goals of the organization \n(e.g. through higher performance). \nSelf-efficacy \nBandura (1995) defines self-efficacy as \u201cbeliefs in one\u2019s capabilities to organize and execute \nthe courses of action required to manage prospective situations\u201c (p. 2). These beliefs influence not \nonly the initiation of behavior, the expended effort, and the persistence of behavior in the face of \nobstacles (Bandura, 1982, 1984) but also the goals people set for themselves (Bandura, 1984). \nAs to the development of self-efficacy, Bandura (1977a\/b, 1982, 1997) names four sources \nof self-efficacy: Mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and \nemotional states. The four sources and their relationship to the occupational context as they are \nimportant for the issue of preparedness for occupational change (as will be shown below) are briefly \nexlained. The forth source of self-efficacy is not explained in detail here as it is a weak influence on \nself-efficacy (Bandura, 1982) and -probably -can not be influenced by leaders although in a working \ncontext physiological arousal might be interpreted as anxiety and thus lead to lower self-efficacy. \nThe successful execution of a behavior leads to an increase in self-efficacy concerning this \nbehavior (Bandura 1977a, 1982). Bandura (1977a) calls this mastery experience. For example, a \nperson who has learned that he \/ she is able to produce a certain behavior will probably believe he \/ \nshe could produce this behavior again. If the experience is made in different situations the belief \nwill extend to different kinds of situations and thus become more general.  \nSelf-efficacy can also be increased by seeing somebody else (a model) show a certain \nbehavior (Bandura, 1977a, 1982). This is called vicarious experience (Bandura, 1977a). In order to \nmake the learning process successful the model must have certain attributes. For example, the \nmodel should be similar to the learning person (Bandura, 1977a and b, 1982). \nIn a working context, vicarious experience can easily be imagined. In most cases, people \nwork together in a way that they are able to see each other and thus use each other as a model. They \nwill usually perceive each other as similar regarding their abilities as they all do about the same job \nand will probably have about the same qualifications.  \nA third source of self-efficacy is social or verbal or social persuasion. People who are told \nthat they will be able to execute a certain behavior will be more willing to try to execute this \nbehavior (Bandura, 1977a, 1982). Their self-efficacy regarding this task increases. In a working \nenvironment, there are colleagues on the one hand and superiors on the other who encourage or \ndiscourage a person concerning his \/ her abilities. Of course, leaders can effect self-efficacy through \nall of the three processes mentioned above (see section \u201cleadership\u201d and Schyns, 2001a). \nPreparedness for occupational change and self-efficacy \nAs stated above, Bandura (1982) emphasizes that self-efficacy influences the initiation of a \ncertain behavior, the effort spent on a task, and the persistence on a task in the face of obstacles. \nThese self-efficacy outcomes are important in the working context (e.g. Ashford & Saks, 2000; \nEarly & Lituchy, 1991; Farr & Ford, 1990). They are described further in the this section and their \nimportance in relation to preparedness for occupational change in different stage of organizational \nchange is outlined. Not all outcomes of self-efficacy are relevant in all three stages of organizational \nchange. \nThe initiation of behavior is especially relevant prior to organizational change. It can \nmotivate employees to learn new tasks and can also lead to proactive behavior (Deci & Ryan, 1985). \nSelf-efficacy is positively related to taking initiative (Speier & Frese, 1997). In the context of \norganizational change, the relationship between initiation of behavior and self-efficacy could be \nconfirmed by Morrison and Brantner (1992), who concentrated on enhancers and inhibitors of \nlearning a new job. Self-efficacy was positively related to learning a new job and thus considered as \nan enhancer. Self-efficacy therefore probably influences the processes prior to organizational \nchanges when qualification becomes necessary. \nNoe and Wilk (1993) included self-efficacy in their study on developmental activities. Self-\nefficacy was positively related to different measures of developmental activities. Thus, it can be \nassumed that employees with high self-efficacy are more prone to invest in their own career and \nstrive for higher task demands. \nPersistence is especially relevant during organizational change. Often, change processes are \nconnected with backlashes, for example when new technologies do not work as expected or when \nnew structures first lead to lower productivity. Employees with high self-efficacy and thus high \npersistence are less prone to \u201cgive up\u201d when obstacles appear in organizational change processes. \nThis could be true after organizational change as well. \nThe effort spent in the execution of behavior may be especially important after \norganizational change. When changes are introduced, performance is supposed to be at least as high \nas it was before the change process. Employees with high self-efficacy are prone to put in more \neffort and thus, their performance will be good even after changes in their task. \n \nEmpirically, the notion that self-efficacy is positively related to organizational change in \ngeneral is supported by several studies. Wanberg and Banas (2000) showed that self-efficacy was \npositively related to openness to organizational change suggesting that self-efficacy has particular \nrelevance in prior to change processes.  \nMcDonald and Siegall (1992) studied the impact of self-efficacy on job attitudes, behaviors, \nand performance of field service technicians whose job had undergone major changes. They found \nthat self-efficacy (in this case technological self-efficacy) was positively related to satisfaction, \ncommitment, and work quality. It was negatively related to lateness and absence. It can be derived \nfrom these results that self-efficacy has a positive relationship to adaptation to organizational \nchange. \nTheory and research on organizational change and self-efficacy support the assumption that \npreparedness for organizational change and self-efficacy are positively related. Research suggests \nthat this is true prior, during, and after organizational change is introduced. \nLeadership and self-efficacy \nLeaders influence employees\u2019 self-efficacy. This process can work through the mechanisms \nmentioned above: mastery experience, vicarious experience, and social persuasion.  \nSupervisors distribute tasks. They can also delegate tasks. Thus, they can provide \nopportunities for their subordinates to experience high task demands and thus to experience \nmastery. For example, in Leader-Member Exchange research, supervisors were found to delegate \ndifferent levels of tasks to their employees (Schriesheim, Neider, Scandura, & Tepper, 1992; Yukl \n& Fu, 1999). Thus, some employees get difficult and important tasks whereas others do not. As a \nconsequence, some employees have the possibility to fulfill difficult tasks and thus, the opportunity \nto increase their self-efficacy beliefs. In general, experiences of success have a positive impact on \nself-efficacy although failures may lead a person to believe that he \/ she has learned from failure and \nthus will be successful in the future (Farr & Ford, 1990). In the case of the constructor of printers \nintroduced in the section \u201cPreparedness for occupational change\u201d, the supervisor could have asked \nthe employee to care for the flow of material at times when the supervisor is not present. \nSupervisors can serve as models for their employees and provide possibilities for vicarious \nexperience. They might show that a task is not really difficult to fulfill by their own example. This \ncan increase employees\u2019 self-efficacy, especially if leader and member are similar. To take up the \nconstructor example again, the supervisor\u2019s could arrange the flow of material in a way that the \nemployee can observe how this is done (e.g. ask the employee to assist him \/ her).  \nIn daily interactions, supervisors can motivate their employees verbally. Thus, social \npersuasion is addressed. They can encourage them to take over difficult tasks (e.g. to secure the \nmaterial flow). They can also communicate high expectations to their followers (this functions even \nunconsciously as Pygmalion research suggests, see e.g. Eden, 1990; King, 1971). The next section \npresents the empirical evidence on the relationship between leadership and self-efficacy. Thereby, \nleadership refers to different theoretical backgrounds. \nStudies on leadership and self-efficacy \nLeadership has been shown to be related to self-efficacy, for example in Pygmalion research \n(Eden, 1990). The Pygmalion effect focuses on effects of (in most cases falsely induced) \nexpectations of leaders on their followers. These expectations influence leaders\u2019 behaviors in so far \nas they support the subordinates they perceive (after inducement of expectations) as high potentials. \nThe leader behavior in turn influences followers\u2019 self-efficacy (Eden, 1990). Sutton and Woodman \n(1989) showed that leader behavior influenced self-expectations in an organizational context over a \nperiod of three months. \nIn research on transformational leadership, self-efficacy has also been shown to be related to \nleader behavior (Schyns, 2001b  \u00b8Shea & Howell, 1999). Transformational leadership refers to \nexceptional leader behaviors such as idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual \nstimulation, and individualized consideration as they are connected to charismatic leaders (Bass & \nAvolio, 1995). \nIn a cross-sectional study with a heterogeneous sample of employees on the relationship \nbetween transformational leadership and occupational self-efficacy, Schyns (2001b) found a \nsignificant correlation between the two constructs of r = .21. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the \ndesign, no conclusions can be drawn about the direction of influence: Either subordinates with high \nself-efficacy tend to perceive transformational leadership (independent of their leaders\u2019 behavior) or \nthe leaders enhance subordinates\u2019 self-efficacy. \nIn an experimental study with 99 graduate students, Shea and Howell (1999) examined the \neffect of self-efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership, task feedback, and \nperformance. Shea and Howell (1999) state that \u201cThe results of the present study indicate that the \ncharismatic leader may have been successful at instilling confidence in the participants that they \ncould do well at this task, whether or not they received task feedback on their performance\u201d (page \n392). \nIn a longitudinal study of 56 subordinate-superior dyads of a large company, Murphy and \nEnsher (1999) showed that Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) is positively related to self-efficacy. \nLeader-Member Exchange is an approach focusing on the quality of the relationship between a \nleader and each of his \/ her subordinates. It turned out that for employees who low in self-efficacy \nLMX lead to increased self-efficacy believes. \nSchyns and von Collani (2002) examined an instrument to assess occupational self-efficacy. \nUsing a cross-sectional design, they found a significant correlation between Leader-Member \nExchange and occupational self-efficacy of r = .17 in a sample of employees on low levels of \norganizational hierarchy. Again, nothing can be concluded about the direction of influence. \nEmpirical research underlines the theoretical proposition that leadership and self-efficacy are \npositively related: Pygmalion research suggests that leader behavior (influenced by false \ninformation \/ expectation) influences subordinates\u2019 self-efficacy; transformational leadership and \nLeader-Member Exchange are also positively related to self-efficacy. \nModel of leadership and self-efficacy as determinants of preparedness for occupational change \nThese considerations on preparedness for occupational change, self-efficacy, and leadership \nare summarized in a model in Error! Reference source not found.. Self-efficacy influences \npreparedness for occupational change in its three stages as proposed here. Prior to organizational \nchange, self-efficacy influences preparedness for occupational change as it serves as an enhancer for \nlearning new jobs (Morrison & Brantner, 1992), is related to openness for organizational change \n(Wanberg & Banas, 2000) and to developmental activities (Noe & Wilk, 1993). During \norganizational change, employees with high self-efficacy will persist longer when faced with \nobstacles in their new tasks and will expend more effort as self-efficacy theory suggests (Bandura, \n1997). After organizational changes, employees with high self-efficacy more easily adapt to these \nchanges than employees with low self-efficacy (McDonald and Siegall, 1992). They also expend \nmore effort on the new task. \nLeadership influences self-efficacy through the processes proposed by Bandura (1977a): \nLeaders may provide the opportunity for mastery experience to their subordinates. They may serve \nas a model and encourage their subordinates through verbal persuasion. Supportive leadership is \nthus important for employees self-efficacy in all stages of change. Thus, the model presented here is \na flow model, indicating that leadership influenced self-efficacy through the explained processes. \nSelf-efficacy in turn influences employees\u2019 preparedness for occupational change in different stages \nof organizational change. \nSummary and Implications \nIn this paper, the relationship between preparedness for occupational change, self-efficacy, \nand leadership was considered. The definition of preparedness for occupational change involves the \nquestion of higher task demands (especially as it is connected to organizational change). In this \nsense, preparedness for occupational change refers to the willingness to take on tasks with higher \ndemands than the present task.  \nThis preparedness is related to self-efficacy in so far as employees with high self-efficacy \ntake on more demanding tasks more willingly. Their self-efficacy leads them to assume that they \ncan successfully fulfill a task and thus, they will not only take on this task but also persist longer in \nits execution if they do not succeed at once (Bandura, 1997). Different processes influence self-\nefficacy. In an organizational change context, qualification can enhance self-efficacy prior to \nchange. In a training context employees learn how to execute tasks and thus their self-efficacy \nimproves (see Bloom & Sheerer, 1992). \nIt is also important for employees\u2019 self-efficacy that they are informed about the kinds of \nchanges that are connected to organizational change. Only with full knowledge of future tasks can \nemployees speculate about the extent to which their competence will meet up to the new demands.  \nLeadership influences self-efficacy through different processes, namely through the \npossibility for mastery experience, the possibility for vicarious experience, and verbal persuasion. \nWith respect to self-efficacy, a leader can provide possibilities for mastery experience, for example \nthrough task assignments. This can be done prior to change but will also be of importance during \nand after change. Assignment of tasks involving great responsibility does not only lead to the \npossibility of mastery experiences but also implies that the supervisors trusts the employee as far as \nhis \/ her abilities are concerned. \nThe model introduced here connects important organizational variables. Especially in times \nof increasing organizational change, it is necessary for companies to prepare their employees for a \nchange in their task. The model presented here can serve as a guide for organizations in different \nstages of organizational change. It shows the important role of leadership via self-efficacy. \nHowever, it has to be taken into account that leaders are affected by organizational change \nthemselves. Thus, their tasks might change as well (Brodbeck & Rendisch, 1993). \nRecent research has emphasized the importance of self-efficacy in organizational contexts. If \nthe model is proved to be valid, organizations that plan changes or that are in the middle of change \nprocesses need to pay particular attention to their employees\u2019 self-efficacy. This can be done \nthrough a training of their leaders on how self-efficacy is influenced in a working context. Specific \nleader behavior which could be extracted from Pygmalion research (e.g. Eden, 1990) and proved to \ninfluence followers\u2019 self-efficacy can be integrated in this training.  \nIn addition, it could be important for organizations to identify employees with high self-\nefficacy as they are probably more willing to accept change and are better able to adapt to change. \nThey could serve as change agents for their colleagues and subordinates. The model presented here \ncan thus be helpful in organizational change processes.  \nFuture research \nAs seen above, some parts of the model are already supported by recent research. In order to \ntest the complete model, all components of the model should be examined in one study. The model \nrefers to different stages of change which have to be taken into account in future research. The \nprocess of leaders influencing followers\u2019 self-efficacy should be examined in all stages of change. In \nthis model, to be seen as a first suggestion, the same influencing processes (i.e., mastery experience, \nvicarious experience, verbal persuasion) were assumed to be relevant for all stages of change. It is \nhowever reasonable to assume that different processes have different amounts of influence on \nfollowers\u2019 self-efficacy in the three stages of organizational change.  \nWhereas the model addresses stage of change connected to organizational change, an \ninteresting topic would be followers\u2019 self-initiated change concerning their career. For example, \nemployees with high self-efficacy might search for change in a way that also affects the \norganization, for example through voicing propositions for change. \nFinally, one has to take into account that organizations can stay in a constant state of change. \nThus, the stages of change might not be differentiated in organizational praxis. Different processes \nlike learning, persistence, and adaptation will probably amalgamate in organizations. For leaders it \nwill thus be important to constantly try and enhance employees\u2019 self-efficacy via the methods \nintroduced here. \nReferences \nArmenakis, A. A., Harris, S. G., & Field, H. S.
