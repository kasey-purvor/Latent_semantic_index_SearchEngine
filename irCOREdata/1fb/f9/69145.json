INTRODUCTION\nGroup object tracking has been investigated during the last\nyears in various applications including road traffic systems,\nmilitary surveillance and in particular for ground moving tar-\nget indicator (GMTI) tracking [2] and robotics applications\n[3, 4, 5, 6]. GMTI group target tracking is concerned with\ntracking groups of objects, such as convoys of vehicles, mov-\ning on the ground from an airborne sensor platform, taking\nnoisy measurements, e.g., range and bearing angle.\nGroups of targets can be considered as formations of enti-\nties whose number varies over time because targets can enter\na scene, or disappear at random times. The groups can split,\nmerge, to be near to each other or move largely independently\non each other. However, it is typical for group formations to\nmaintain some patterns of movement [7] and hence the meth-\nods for group tracking differ from the methods of standard\nmultiple-target tracking. Although individual targets in the\ngroup can exhibit independent movement at a certain level,\noverall the group will move as one whole, synchronising the\nmovement of the individual entities and avoiding collisions.\nDifferent models of groups of objects have been proposed\nin the literature, such as the flocking models [8, 9, 10], in-\nWe acknowledge the support of the EPSRC, under project EP\/E027253\/1\nand the support of the UK MOD Data and Information Fusion Defence Tech-\nnology Centre. We are thankful also QinetiQ, Malvern for providing us with\nthe real ground moving target indicator data sets and useful discussions. Fi-\nnally, this work is completed with stimulating discussions and networking\nactivities with the EU COST action TU0702.\ncluding leader-follower models [7]. However, estimating the\ndynamic evolution of the group structure has not been widely\nstudied in the literature, although there are similarities with\nmethods used in evolving network models [11, 12].\nIn [1], the group structure is modeled as evolving undi-\nrected random graphs with measurements which origin is ex-\nactly known. Then, an evolution model is defined for the\ngroup structure and the efficiency of the approach is showed\nthrough a scenario with simulated data. The main contribu-\ntion of the present paper is the proposed solution for group\nobject structure and state estimation with measurement uncer-\ntainty. A Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF)\nis applied by taking into account the structure of the group.\nResults are presented over real GMTI data.\nThe remaining part of the paper is organised in the fol-\nlowing way. Section 2 formulates group structure modeling\nwith evolving random graphs and the group structure evolu-\ntion model. Section 3 presents the Bayesian formulation an\nimplementation solution based on a particle filter and joint\nprobability data association. Section 4 presents the results\nand finally Section 5 summarises the results.\n2. GROUP STRUCTURE MODELING\n2.1. Evolving Network Models\nOne of the challenges in group object tracking is in the neces-\nsity of updating the group structure and modeling the interac-\ntions between separate components. In [1], at time instant t, a\ngroup structure Gt is defined as a graph. The group structure\nGt models both the targets within the groups (nodes in the\ngraph) and some relations between the groupmembers, which\nis reflected by the edges between the related graph nodes.\nEach node of the graph corresponds to an object within the\ngroup and the presence (resp. absence) of an edge between\ntwo nodes means presence (absence) of interactions between\nthese objects.\n2.2. Group Object Structure Evolution Model\nIn [1], an evolution model Gt = f(Gt\u22121,Xt) for the group\nstructure, for time t > 0 and an initialisation process G0 =\nf(X0) for time t = 0 are introduced. The vector Xt =\n473978-1-4244-2710-9\/09\/$25.00 c\u00a9 2009 IEEE\n(xt,1, . . . ,xt,n) comprises the state vectors of all the targets\nand f denote the desired evolution model.\nThe system\n{\nt = 0, G0 = fI(X0),\nt > 0, Gt = fNS \u25e6 fNI \u25e6 fEU (Gt\u22121,Xt),\n(1)\nshows the decomposition of the evolution model f according\nto the time t and according to three distinctive steps: edge\nupdating, node adding and node removal where \u25e6 denotes\nthe composition operation; fI is an Initialisation model; fEU\nis the graph Edge Updating model; fNI is the graph Nodes\nIncorporation; fNS is the graph Nodes Suppression model.\nThe edge updating step and the nodes incorporation step\nare modeled using a second graph G\u2032 having the group cen-\ntres as nodes. Indeed, the computational complexity can be\nreduced when some information about group centres (means,\nvariances and the distances between them) is used. We refer\nto [1], for more details.\nv1\nv2\nv10\nv11\nv6\nv8\nv12\nv3\nv4\nv5\nv7\nv9\ng1\ng2\ng3\n1g\nO\n2g\nO\n3g\nO\nG\nG\u2019\nFig. 1. Illustration of the graphical approach for the group\nstructure. In this example the graph structureG contains three\nconnected components (three groups). A second graph G\u2032\nmodels the distance between groups. G\u2032 is used for the edge\nupdating process, the node incorporation process and in the\ndata association process\n3. BAYESIAN FORMULATION AND PARTICLE\nFILTER IMPLEMENTATION\nEach target i is characterised by its state vector xt,i = (xt,i,\nx\u02d9t,i, yt,i, y\u02d9t,i)\n\u2032 (comprising the positions xt,i, yt,i and veloci-\nties x\u02d9t,i, y\u02d9t,i in x and y directions respectively);\n\u2032 denotes the\ntranspose operation. At each time instant, the set of objects\ntracked in a group g can be modeled by a Random Finite Set\n(RFS, see [7]) X\ng\nt .\nAt time t a measurement vector zt is received which can\nbe described as a function of the augmented RFS state Xt =\n{X\ng\n1\nt , . . . ,X\ngnG\nt } (nG denotes the number of groups in Gt\nand gi, i \u2208 {1, . . . , nG} denotes the groups in Gt. Assum-\ning that the measurement likelihood function p(zt|Xt) can\nbe calculated, the purpose is to compute sequentially the state\nprobability density function for each group of objects. Ad-\nditionally, the groups\u2019 movements are assumed independent.\nIndeed, the changes of the groups such as merging and split-\nting are taken into account during the graph update process.\nUnder the Markovian assumption for the state transition,\nthe Bayesian prediction and filtering steps can be written as\nfollows:\np(Xt,Gt|Z1:t\u22121) = p(Gt|Xt,Z1:t\u22121)\u00d7 p(Xt|Z1:t\u22121)\n=\n\u222b\np(Gt|Xt,Gt\u22121)\u00d7\np(Xt|Xt\u22121,Gt\u22121)p(Xt\u22121,Gt\u22121|Z1:t\u22121)dXt\u22121dGt\u22121, (2)\np(Xt,Gt|Z1:t) =\np(zt|Xt,Gt)\u00d7 p(Xt,Gt|Z1:t\u22121)\np(zt|Z1:t\u22121)\n, (3)\nwhere Z1:t is the set of measurements up to time t and zt is\nthe current vector of measurements. With the independence\nassumptions between groups, the following supplementary equa-\ntion\np(Xt|Xt\u22121,Gt\u22121) =\n\u220f\ng\ni\n\u2208Gt\u22121\np(X\ngi\nt |X\ngi\nt\u22121), (4)\ncan be written.\nIn order to perform the correction step, the likelihood func-\ntion p(zt|Xt,Gt) of the whole state has to be evaluated by\nmeans of a data association approach. The JPDA algorithm\n[13] is used to resolve the measurement origin uncertainty.\nIn addition other information about the graph structure\ncan be used, such as the distance between groups in order to\nreduce the number of hypotheses. Figure 1 shows an example\nwhere group g3 can be considered separately from groups g1\nand g2. The graph G\n\u2032\nt estimated at each time and used in the\nedge updating and in the nodes incorporation steps can be also\nused to reduce the data association computation. At each time\ninstant, groups in the same graph G\u2032t\u2019s connected component\nare gathered in the same data association process: the graph\nG\u2032t offers a straightforward method of clustering the targets\nfor the data association process.\nDenote by {g\u20321, . . . ,g\n\u2032\nnG\u2032\n}, the set of nG\u2032 connected com-\nponents in graph G\u2032. In other words, any connected compo-\nnent g\u2032i models a set of groups that are close enough to be\ntreated in a same data association algorithm. Under indepen-\ndence assumption between the g\u2032i, the following equation (5)\ncan be written.\np(zt|Xt,Gt) = p(zt|Xt,Gt,G\n\u2032\nt)\n=\n\u220f\ni=1,...,nG\u2032\np(z\ng\u2032\ni\nt |X\ng\u2032\ni\nt\u22121) (5)\nwhereX\ng\u2032\ni\nt\u22121 is the set of targets\u2019 states belonging to the groups\nin g\u2032i. The vector z\ng\ni\nt comprises the subset of measurements\n474 2009 IEEE\/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing\nrelated with the group in g\u2032i. For example, z\ngi\nt can be chosen\nby gating measurements using the set of targets state X\ng\u2032\ni\nt\u22121.\nAlgorithm 1 shows a particle filter algorithm developed\nfrom the Bayesian formulation above, where Np represents\nthe number of particles.\nAlgorithm.

These data are provided to\nus by QinetiQ [14]. Two groups of targets are moving on\nthe ground and there is a crossing of their paths which makes\nadditional ambiguity for the group tracking algorithm. The\nGMTI measurements are obtained by an embedded radar on\na moving airborn platform. As seen from Figure 2, there is\nclutter noise in the measured bearing angles and measured\ndistances to the targets. The developed approach provides\ngood estimation accuracy of each vehicle trajectory positions\n(see Figure 3). Figure 4 additionally shows that the estimated\nx coordinates of the groups are close to x coordinates calcu-\nlated from the measurements. The proposed algorithm is able\nto cope with the crossed trajectories of the groups.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper presents a solution to the problem of group struc-\nture and state estimation in the presence of measurement ori-\ngin uncertainty. The group structure is modeled as an evolv-\ning random graph and an evolution model is designed for\nthe group structure. In addition, an algorithm is developed\ncombining particle filtering and joint probability data associ-\nation. The graph structure is estimated in a probabilistic way\nby introducing a group graph structure in the particle filter\nsamples. performance of the approach is validated over real\nground moving target indicator data sets.\n6.
