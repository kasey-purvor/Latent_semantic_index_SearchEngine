New developments in biotechnology and health\nmaintenance programmes appear to be forging new relationships between biology, medicine and\nthe lives of older people. A number of social scientists describe the process as the \u2018biomedicaliza-\ntion of aging\u2019.

We then provide a genealogy\nof the critique and close the argument by pointing to sources of uncertainty within biogerontol-\nogy, which should be taken into account in any further studies of the relationship between\nbiology, medicine and the lives of older people.\nKeywords Ageing, Biology, Biomedicine, Evolution, Governance, Medicine, Public Health\nOver the past two decades, interest in the basic biological processes underlying the phenom-\nenon of \u2018ageing\u2019 has grown considerably. The emergence of the so-called \u2018anti-ageing\u2019 move-\nment and the controversies surrounding its promises to extend human longevity have\ncaptured the attention of the British and American public, but so have the more sober\nassessments presented in popular books such as Leonard Hayflick\u2019s How and why we age\n(1994) and Thomas Kirkwood\u2019s Time of our lives: The science of human aging (1999).\nThis interest has motivated both consultations on public attitudes toward research into\nthe causes of ageing (Alliance for Aging Research, 2005; MORI, 2006) and political inter-\nventions such as the White House Conference on Aging (2005) and the House of Lords\nTiago Moreira is Lecturer in Sociology at Durham University. He has published articles on the sociology of sur-\ngery, the development and use of healthcare standards, regimes of therapeutic evaluation and the use of health tech-\nnologies at home. His current research focuses on priority-setting in health care and on the history of biology of\nageing.\nPaolo Palladino is Professor of History and Theory in the Department of History at Lancaster University.

These developments have been accompanied by an\nintensification of research on the biology of ageing, and the therapeutic value of a number of\nbiomolecules characterized during the course of such research is currently being tested in\nanimal and human trials. Lastly, clinicians would appear to be willing increasingly to pro-\nvide these and other life-extending treatments to older individuals. This entire situation\nhas captured the attention of social scientists, many of whom refer to the \u2018biomedicalization\nof aging\u2019.\nEstes and Binney (1989) first coined the phrase \u2018biomedicalization of aging\u2019 as a label for\nthe processes whereby ageing comes to be defined as a matter of \u2018biomedical\u2019 interest, pro-\ncesses which would appear today to be intensifying and be increasingly associated with the\nreorganization of health care around technological intervention and the modes of preven-\ntion and consumption (Clarke et al., 2003; see also Kaufman et al., 2004). Contemporary\nbiogerontology, a sub-field of gerontology that is simultaneously engaged in the biomolecu-\nlar and biodemographic characterization of the processes associated with the development\nof the individual from birth to death, presents a paradox, however.1 One of its distinctive\nclaims is that it provides an alternative model for understanding those diseases that are com-\nmonly associated with advanced age, such as cardio-vascular disease, cancer and dementia.\nRather than pursuing the disease-specific model that has been deployed within many other\nbranches of the biomedical enterprise, biogerontologists argue that increases in health and\nlongevity are more likely to be achieved by focusing research on the common biological\nbasis of all those diseases that would seem to characterize the lives of older people. Further-\nmore, in reconstructing these diseases as part of a wider set of \u2018degenerative diseases\u2019 that\nare only connected contingently to the organism\u2019s chronological age, biogerontologists\nwould appear to call into question the status of ageing as a biological process. In other\nwords, the development of biogerontology seems to undermine the possibility of any\nstraightforward conjunction of biology and medicine which the phrase \u2018biomedicalization\nof aging\u2019 conjures almost by definition. In drawing attention to this paradox, we follow\nKeating and Cambrosio (2003) and their definition of biomedicine as a set of practices\nthat was established during the second half of the twentieth century and that has organized\nthe relationship between the laboratory and the clinic by means of hybrid \u2018bio-clinical\u2019 entit-\nies. Viewed from this perspective, biomedicine is less the systematic application of biological\nstandards and products in clinical work (Canguilhem, 1991) than it is a set of conventions\nthat are specific to work on particular diseases and that enable the coordination of bench\nand bedside within these delimited domains alone.\nIn this article, we articulate this counter-intuitive understanding of biogerontology by\nfirst exploring the conceptual presuppositions of recent proposals that have emerged\nfrom within biogerontology to reorganize not just gerontological research, but biomedical\nresearch more generally. We then offer a genealogy of the situation by turning to the mid-\ndle decades of the twentieth century, when gerontology first gained institutional recogni-\ntion and the biology of ageing was a domain contested between those who argued for a\n\u2018basic\u2019 approach and those who proposed to focus on the differences between \u2018normal\u2019\n1 Defining biogerontology, especially in relation to the \u2018anti-ageing\u2019 movement and medicine, is fraught with diffi-\nculties and ambiguities (Fishman et al., 2008; Juengst et al., 2003), but we hope that the account we provide here\ngoes some way toward clarifying differences.\n350 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\nand \u2018pathological\u2019 ageing. We then consider how the latter approach came to dominate\nthe organization of gerontological research in both the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, but for very different reasons, and how it was eventually embedded in the activities\nof the National Institute of Aging (NIA). We then trace how the NIA\u2019s blueprint for\nresearch into the causes and treatment of ageing initiated a transatlantic biogerontological\ncritique of biomedicine. Our aim is to establish that the development of biogerontology\ncontrasts sharply with the many successful relationships that have been established\nbetween the laboratory and the clinic by means of mediating, hybrid versions of the\n\u2018normal\u2019 and the \u2018pathological\u2019. If, as Boltanski and The\u00b4venot argue, \u2018the less pure a situ-\nation is (in the sense that it contains objects from different worlds), the easier it is to\ndenounce it\u2019 (1999: 374), biogerontology has harnessed the internal tensions of biomedi-\ncine, seeking to construct a field of action whereby the historical opposition of biomedi-\ncine and public health is no longer relevant and the laboratory, preventative medicine\nand health maintenance programmes can be integrated seamlessly. In the concluding sec-\ntion of this article, however, we point towards some important sources of uncertainty\nwithin the biogerontogical project.\nBiogerontology and biomedicine\nIn the past decade, the organization of gerontological research has gained wide political\nrecognition. In the United States, for example, a group of biogerontologists and policy\nmakers who attended the White House Conference on Aging (2005) drew attention to\nthe minute proportion of the annual budgetary allocation for the National Institutes of\nHealth that is dedicated to understanding the basic biology of ageing, and called on leg-\nislators to reconsider the situation because \u2018the aging research field [is] on the threshold\nof a new way of thinking\u2014shifting from a focus on specific age-related illnesses to a\nsearch for an understanding of aging itself (Alliance for Aging Research, 2005: 4). In\nthe United Kingdom, the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords,\nhas advanced a similar argument, noting that: \u2018most of the research on ageing and health\n. . . is focused on specific diseases and medical conditions for which age is the single lar-\ngest risk factor\u2019, and then bemoaning the paucity of support for much more promising\nprogrammes of research on the \u2018basic processes of ageing\u2019 (House of Lords, 2005: 103).\nThe focal point of these arguments about the current organization of gerontological\nresearch and its limitations is the dependence on clinical definitions of those diseases most\ncommonly associated with old age. According to the authors of a position statement on\nhealth promotion and disease prevention in the twenty-first century (Butler et al., 2008),\nsuch dependence is troubling because it is an effect of an anatomical division of the body\nthat was forged in the nineteenth century and no longer provides a useful way to understand\ndisease. The clinical worldview, these authors maintain, was well-suited to pathologies char-\nacterized by discrete and specific aetiologies, but is inadequate to address the chronic, long-\nterm illnesses of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The protracted temporal\nunfolding of these illnesses is so nearly coterminous with ageing that it unsettles the epi-\nstemic pairing of the \u2018normal\u2019 and the \u2018pathological\u2019 that underpins the clinical perspective\non ageing. Furthermore, this pairing assumes that the two states can be situated proximally\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n351\nand intervened upon directly, but this obscures understanding of the diverse and complex\nprocesses involved in the declining functional capacities of the organism such that the\nperspectives of the laboratory and clinic must be integrated with programmes of health\nscreening and maintenance. A further criticism of biomedical research is that, by relying\non methodological and epistemological structures that are wholly incommensurable with\nthe phenomenon studied, it cannot but fail to deliver effective treatments for those patho-\nlogical states commonly associated with old age. As the House of Lords (2006a) notes:\n\u2018generic research into the process of ageing . . . may be \u2018\u2018the most direct route to developing\nnovel interventions and therapies\u2019\u2019 \u2019. In sum, the charge is that the current organization of\nbiomedicine may serve many clinicians and researchers well, but it fails to secure health\nand longevity.\nAt the same time, the biogerontological critique of biomedicine also aims to redraw the\ncontours of the relationship between biology, medicine and society. As the following extract\nfrom an interview with a biogerontologist suggests, what is required is a wholly new\napproach to disease.2 Having been asked about his expertise, this biogerontologist fore-\ngrounds the issue of normal ageing:\n[My] scientific interest is to explain the occurrence of age associated diseases. Some\npeople call that ageing, some people call that normal ageing, [and] some people say it\u2019s\ndifferent from normal ageing. I don\u2019t make a distinction between them.\nWhen pressed on the importance attached today to research on the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s\nDisease (AD) as answer to the problems posed by old age, this biogerontologist adds:\nWhat\u2019s behind, let\u2019s say the senile muscle, is of equal importance . . . because people\ncan\u2019t go out any more and they suffer from it. What\u2019s normal? There\u2019s nothing like\nnormal ageing.\nWhat is important, according to this biogerontologist, is a historical disjunction between the\ngenome and the environment to which the genome is exposed:\n[We] were not meant to live longer than forty years, and the system is optimized in an\nenvironment like Africa. But now we don\u2019t live in Africa. . . . [Our] life history is . . . the\nresult of . . . an old, optimized genome . . . now . . . exposed under modern, affluent\nconditions. But it\u2019s not meant to be . . . it\u2019s not meant to be exposed under these\nconditions.\nFrom this perspective, normality is a historically specific discrimination of little biological\nsignificance, at least insofar as biology is equated with attention to the evolutionary\ndynamics shaping the life course of the organism. This argument has gained considerable\nmomentum in the context of what has become known as \u2018evolutionary medicine\u2019 (Nesse\nand Williams, 1996) and encapsulates a more general approach that undermines the long-\nestablished recourse to a categorical contrast between normal and pathological states,\nwhereby problems that could be regarded as \u2018of equal importance\u2019 are instead organized\n2 The interview was conducted in the context of the ESRC funded project \u2018Boundary work, normal ageing and\nbrain pathology\u2019.\n352 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\nhierarchically, focusing primarily on disease and ultimately reflecting the organization of\nmedical specialities and markets.\nHow are we to understand this critique of biomedicine which, in many ways, contradicts\nextant analyses of the science of ageing? Our thesis is that it is rooted in gerontologists\u2019\ncomplex and fraught relationship to the enterprise of biomedicine as the latter took shape\nduring the latter half of the twentieth century. Consequently, in what follows, we document\ndiverse attempts to forge some relationship between biology, medicine and ageing, and\nhow these enterprises were ultimately incorporated into a biomedical approach that empha-\nsizes the medical pathologies of old age, rather than focusing on ageing as a complex biolo-\ngical phenomenon. To avoid any misunderstanding, we must emphasize at this point that\nwhat we are seeking to offer is a genealogy of the present situation, a \u2018history of the pres-\nent\u2019, rather than any account of origins.\nBetween unity of causes and unity of effects\nBetween the late 1930s and early 1950s, a variety of public and private actors became inter-\nested in the biology of ageing. Underpinned by a burgeoning volume of actuarial projections\nof an \u2018ageing population\u2019 and preoccupation about economic deprivation and illness\n(Haber and Gratton, 1994; Thane, 2000), such interest was not matched however by any\npre-existent, agreed set of epistemic commitments among the variety of actors studying\nageing as a strictly biological phenomenon. Instead, it excited a number of debates over\nthe definition of ageing, which resulted in a diversity of possible answers to the questions\nposed by these public and private actors. Such divergence was particularly evident during\nthe conferences supported by two of the most active philanthropic supporters of research\non ageing, the Josiah Macy Foundation in the United States and the Nuffield Foundation\nin the United Kingdom.\nThe Josiah Macy Foundation was responsible for funding surveys of ageing in the 1930s\nand commissioning a seminal conference on the biology of ageing at the end of the decade.\nAs Park (2008) has documented, Edmund Cowdry\u2019s edition of the published proceedings of\nthis conference was riven by disagreement between the various contributors, mostly around\nthe \u2018parameters\u2019 and \u2018standards\u2019 by which to contrast normal and pathological ageing. Simi-\nlarly, the Nuffield Foundation was a key sponsor of ageing research and is renowned for\nhaving sponsored the Survey Committee on the Problems of Ageing and the Care of People,\nwhich brought the living conditions of older citizens to the attention of the British public\n(Thane, 2000). What is less known is the Nuffield Foundation\u2019s support for research into\nthe biology of ageing, which started in 1940 and eventually resulted in an extensive network\nof laboratories across the United Kingdom. Here too, however, the uncertainties were pro-\nfound and, when the Nuffield Foundation sponsored a symposium in 1956 to showcase its\nachievements in this domain, there was conflict between those who wanted to find stan-\ndards by which to contrast normal and pathological ageing and those who considered this\nendeavour entirely pointless.\nThe questions of definition raised during these diverse encounters were most clearly deli-\nneated during the first CIBA Foundation Colloquium on Ageing, which was held in 1954,\nimmediately after the first meeting of the International Gerontological Association. The\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n353\nlist of participants included the leading experts of the day on the biology of ageing. Accord-\ning to the published proceedings of the colloquium, following the chairman\u2019s introduction\nof the concluding, general discussion, Alex Comfort, Nuffield Research Fellow in the\nDepartment Zoology at University College, London, intervened in the following terms:\nI would like to put in a plea for [Professor Medawar\u2019s] definition of senescence as the\nincrease in liability to die with advancing age. It may be proper to distinguish ageing\nfrom senescence, but in that case I think we can scrap ageing altogether and call it\ndevelopment, because gerontology is an entity which only comes into existence to\ndescribe a process human beings don\u2019t like, a deteriorative process, and I take it that it\nis senescence with which we are concerned here.\nEarlier in the meeting Dr. Lansing made a declaration of faith on the subject of the\noverall unity of the senescent process. I don\u2019t want to speak out of turn, but I\u2019m some-\nwhat sceptical of [the] underlying unity of any ageing process.\nComfort\u2019s call for a conventional definition of \u2018ageing\u2019 did not go unchallenged. Albert\nLansing, from the Department of Anatomy at Washington University, responded:\nLansing: But take the male rotifer: it is born, it has no alimentary trait and dies of\nstarvation within twenty-four hours after fertilizing. Does he die of senescence? I\u2019d\nrather put him in a special category, as a very degenerate character who starves to\ndeath in the twenty-four-hour period that he is busy fertilizing. . . . When I think of\nsenescence I think of something that happens not to children or to infant rotifers, but\nto the organism that has become an adult and then undergone some type of change, to\nwind up dead sooner or later. That\u2019s what I mean by senescence. The maturation of the\nembryo, the new born child, the adolescent, the changes with time prior to maturation,\nto me are not senescence.\nCowdry: Yours is the downswing of life, then.\nLansing: Yes, after adulthood has been reached. I can\u2019t define adulthood too well, and\nin some cases the changes that occur in adulthood are said to be improvements rather\nthan losses.\nCowdry: You don\u2019t have to define it if you just call it the downswing, that implies that\nafter a height you start to go down.\nComfort: Do you agree then that for various organisms the factors that contribute to\nthat downswing tend to differ very radically from phylum to phylum?\nLansing: I\u2019m not prepared to agree to that. I think we have special cases which bring\nabout death, but not all death is due to senescence. . . . The declaration of\nfaith I made yesterday stems in part from the various types of survival curves that\nDr. Comfort showed us. . . . It would be quite a coincidence if all these processes all\nexpressed themselves in the same way.\nComfort: Raymond Pearl plotted a survival curve for automobiles which was again\nthe same shape!\nAt this point, Nathan Shock, the Director of the Gerontology Section of the National\nHeart Institute\/National Institutes of Health and effective founder of the International\nGerontological Association, interjected:\n354 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\nShock: I think the argument that because two different phenomena can be made to fit\nthe same mathematical formulation they have common processes behind them is an\nextremely hazardous one.\nLansing: I said only that it\u2019s a possibility, I\u2019m not prepared to say that we have as\nmany kinds of protoplasm as we have species. I think there is common protoplasm\nwith basic properties of multiplication and growth, decline, irritability and so on,\nvarying in detail, not in principle.\nShock sought to bring the argument to a close in the following terms:\nI would agree that protoplasm is probably fundamentally much the same stuff,\nalthough we know that various tissues develop different functions, so that their enzyme\nsystems must vary quite widely between different cells in the same animal. To that\nextent, I would agree that perhaps if you knew what it was that caused a cell to lose its\nability to maintain concentration gradients, maintain its metabolic processes, you\nwould be a long way toward understanding the ageing process. But it seems to me that\nthe techniques that we have for investigating single cells are very meagre. Dr. Cowdry\nfeels that if you take a cell out of its tissue it is no longer a cell. If we accept this\nposition we are limited to unicellular organisms for study, but unfortunately most of\nthese species simply divide and form two new cells so that \u2018ageing\u2019 fails to occur. Thus,\nwe are faced with the problem of studying more complex animals or tissue, using both\nbiochemical and physiological techniques. Since changes in the environment of the cell,\nproduced by changing the diet of the animal, will often result in alterations in cellular\nenzymes, it seems to me that perhaps we are going to have to look at the problem of\nageing from a number of different levels simultaneously and not try at the moment to\nconceptualize the entire problem in one framework. Prof. Medawar has approached\nthe problem from a statistical evaluation of life tables; I am not prepared to accept this\napproach as the only way out of the difficulties. I think the examination of life table\nmight be an index as to what you were doing to a process, but if you are going to\nexplain ageing as a process I think ultimately you have to look at individuals, and\nperhaps the best way is to look at them from different points of view and at different\nlevels of organization. I doubt if it would be possible to formulate a definition of ageing\nthat would be acceptable to everybody and would cover all the aspects of the problem\nas it now stands. (Wolstenholme and Cameron, 1955: 240\u2013244)\nThis debate can be regarded as the confrontation of three different visions of the biology\nof ageing, underpinned by disparate epistemic and political commitments. The first of these\nwas that advanced by Comfort and Peter Medawar, Professor of Zoology at University\nCollege, London. Theirs was the perspective of population geneticists working with life\ntables and relying on evolutionary arguments to explain differences between populations\nand species. On their account, ageing or senescence was an age-specific aggregation of bio-\nlogical phenomena that were physiologically unrelated and peculiar to animals protected\nfrom the rigours of natural selection. This understanding suggests that any interventions\nthey might have envisioned would operate at the aggregate, population level. Against this\nperspective was that of experimental biologists such as Cowdry and Lansing, who relied\non particular organisms to produce models of physiological phenomena that were assumed\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n355\nto hold across different species. From this perspective, ageing was to be regarded as a unit-\nary phenomenon that occurred in all organisms at some point in their developmental cycle\nand any interventions should operate at the cellular level. The third perspective, represented\nby Shock, was first that the first two perspectives were epistemologically equivalent, and,\nsecond, that the individual should be regarded as the fundamental biological unit, which\ncould then be examined \u2018from different points of view\u2019. This programme was to be delivered\nby physiological measurements of the ageing individual in the laboratory, clinic or commun-\nity so as to establish standards of \u2018normal ageing\u2019, and would leave to clinicians the task of\nmanaging the pathologies of ageing.\nImportantly, Shock\u2019s ability to subsume the first two perspectives and to do so with suf-\nficient authority to close the debate, at least temporarily, was not underpinned by some\nalternative disciplinary approach, but by changes happening elsewhere. Shock\u2019s proposal\nto embrace \u2018different points of view\u2019 aimed to integrate gerontology in the institutional\ntransformation sparked by the creation of the National Institutes of Health and correlated\nprivate and public investments in research programmes on cancer and heart disease that\nhave come to define the biomedical enterprise (see Gaudillie`re, 2002; see also Keating\nand Cambrosio, 2003). It is to the project of integrating gerontology with the emerging\nbiomedical enterprise that we now turn.\nCoordinating medicine, biology and old age\nThere can be little doubt that, during the 1950s and 1960s, Nathan Shock played a pivotal\nrole in integrating gerontological research within the changing institutional organization of\nAmerican medical research, and in aligning gerontology with the normative requirements of\nemergent biomedicine (see Achenbaum, 1995). This was encapsulated primarily in the\ndesign of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), which Shock began to develop\nin the mid 1950s to measure individual functional capacity over time (see Bookstein and\nAchenbaum, 1993). Although contemporary with the longitudinal studies which character-\nized American public health research during these years, such as the Framingham Heart\nStudy (see Oppenheimer, 2005; Rothstein, 2003), the BLSA was distinctive insofar as it\nfocused on \u2018healthy individuals\u2019 alone, to the exclusion of all those who contracted any ill-\nnesses. This was due to Shock\u2019s interest in disentangling \u2018pure ageing\u2019 from \u2018disease\u2019 and so\nproviding the standard that would guide geriatricians in their diagnosis and management of\nold age illnesses (Shock, 1956, 1961). This concurred with the aims of geriatricians them-\nselves. From the 1940s onward, American geriatrics aimed to establish itself within medical\nspecialities, and, as Hirshbein (2000) has suggested, this was achieved by evoking a notion\nof normal ageing and then defining the expertise of the geriatrician as dealing with the pre-\nvention and treatment of diseases of old age. Gerontology, particularly the physiological\nand functional measurement provided by case-controlled or longitudinal studies such as\nthose that Shock proposed, was construed as providing the requisite biological standards.\nImportantly, Shock\u2019s distinction between normal and pathological ageing served not only\nclinical, but also political goals when the plan to establish a national programme of research\ninto the causes of the diseases commonly associated with old age finally moved onto the\nnational political agenda and was constructed on this same distinction (Achenbaum,\n356 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\n1995). Equally importantly, while the distinction would appear to have enabled a hybrid\nunderstanding of normal ageing that was workable in the clinic and the laboratory,\nthe development of gerontology was constrained by its institutional association with the\nVeterans\u2019 Administration (VA) (Achenbaum, 1995; Haber, 1986) such that it was only\nwhen the claims advanced by ever larger numbers of ageing veterans started to strain the\nVA\u2019s resources that the calls to establish a national programme of research into the causes\nof the diseases associated with old age gained any political support. In other words, the\nsolidity of the alignment between Shock and the nascent NIA should not be overestimated\nand it is perhaps no surprise that, despite Shock\u2019s ambitions to create a national programme\nof research that might help to differentiate healthy from unhealthy ageing, the NIA only\nsecured a firm political foothold when it began consistently to sponsor research on what,\nat least according to Robert Butler, has today become the defining disease of old age, AD\n(Anon., 2008; see also Ballenger, 2006).\nIn the United Kingdom, a different configuration of medicine, biology and old age not\nonly distanced gerontology from biology altogether, but ultimately resulted in the signi-\nficant weakening of gerontology as an autonomous discipline. Some of the reasons for\nthis are most evident if a comparison is made of the disciplinary affiliations of the parti-\ncipants in the CIBA Foundation Colloquium and those of the Nuffield Trust conference\non the \u2018biology of ageing\u2019. While no social scientists appear to have been invited to\nattend the CIBA Foundation Symposium, other than in an honorary capacity, the confer-\nence funded by the Nuffield Trust was organized by, and attracted, a very diverse group\nof experts, some being zoologists or botanists and others being clinicians, psychologists\nor economists. The challenge was then to establish how their diverse expertise might\nbe coordinated so as to address the social and political question posed by ageing. This\nsituation is not surprising given that the Nuffield Foundation was renowned as the spon-\nsor of the Survey Committee on the Problems of Ageing and the Care of People, and\nthat, in the absence of any substantial, structured funding by the Medical Research\nCouncil (MRC) for research on the biology of ageing, the Nuffield Foundation supported\na variety of academic programmes that relied on equally varied methods, though focusing\nprimarily on the importance of social and economic conditions to the definition of \u2018nor-\nmal\u2019 ageing. Furthermore, as Martin has observed, it was not through the laboratory but\n\u2018through the technique of the survey [that] doctors created a body of knowledge relating\nto the social, economic, and medical needs of the aged population in their own districts\u2019\n(1995: 458). In the process, British geriatricians defined gerontology as the field, in Lord\nAmulree\u2019s words, concerned with \u2018those elderly sick with social and economic problems\u2019\n(in Martin, 1995: 460, italics added). Importantly, this construction positioned geronto-\nlogy outside the hospital, the main research platform of British biomedicine during the\nsecond half of the twentieth century (Stewart, 2008). Furthermore, the consequent asso-\nciation between old age and that peculiarly British disciplinary integration of social and\nmedical science that went by the name of \u2018social medicine\u2019 was responsible for much un-\ncertainty around the place of the elderly within the National Health Service (NHS). Un-\nder these circumstances, any funding for research on the medical problems posed by\nolder people tended to be allocated to disease-specific programmes within the MRC\nbecause there seemed to be nothing so biologically and clinically distinctive and remark-\nable about the patients\u2019 chronological age as to deserve the attention of a specialist (see\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n357\nalso Ballenger, 2006). Finally, in the 1960s and 1970s, when social medicine lost its pre-\ncarious institutional support within both the MRC and NHS (Porter, 1997), British\ngerontology lost all residual disciplinary legitimacy. Thus, despite the fact that at the\ntime of the CIBA Foundation Colloquium the evolutionary perspective on ageing was a\nwholly British and very vibrant current, institutional and political factors had worked\ntogether to progressively disconnect biological explanations of ageing from any public\ndebates and programmes to address the \u2018problem of old age\u2019, so that Peter Medawar\ncould declare in 1977 that British gerontology was moribund and that \u2018those anxious\nabout the possible malefactions of research on ageing should take comfort from the\nfact that the great public and private agencies are not competing with each other in their\nendeavours to support research on ageing\u2019 (Medawar and Medawar, 1977: 159).\nIn sum, if the \u2018problem of old age\u2019 emerged during the years between the late 1930s and\nearly 1950s as a pressing political question and a variety of powerful institutions became\ninterested in the biology of ageing, the successful alignment of ageing, biology and medicine\nwas a highly contingent and unstable affair.\nThe trouble with the National Institute of Aging\nIt is widely acknowledged that the establishment of the NIA was a difficult and protracted\nmatter. Importantly, while the difficulties have been portrayed as a matter of divergence\nbetween gerontologists and the medical establishment (Lockett, 1983), there also is evidence\nof divergence among gerontologists themselves over the framing of a coordinated pro-\ngramme of research on the biological origins of ageing.\nBetween 1963 and 1965, Leonard Hayflick, a cytologist working in the expansive\ndomain of experimental oncology, challenged the notion that cell lines were potentially\nimmortal by demonstrating that the number of replications cells could undergo was limited\nand that the limit was fixed by cellular mechanisms that were eventually located within the\nnucleus (Landecker, 2007). The challenge went unnoticed among oncologists because the\nnotion that cell lines were potentially immortal was too solidly embedded in the material\npractices of experimental oncology, but it did not go unnoticed among gerontologists inso-\nfar as it offered scope to re-articulate and revitalize Edmund Cowdry\u2019s experimental\napproach to ageing. This interest peaked in 1973, when Hayflick received the Robert\nKleemeier Award, which the Gerontological Society of America bestowed annually \u2018in\nrecognition of outstanding research in the field of gerontology\u2019. In his acceptance lecture,\nHayflick, while admitting feeling \u2018somewhat uncomfortable in accepting an award for\nwork which at the outset was undertaken with the biology of aging farthest from [his]\nmind\u2019 (1974: 37), was quick to propose the following:\nWhat are the implications to gerontologists of the notions that are emerging from\ncytogerontology? I believe that there are several important implications. The first is\nthat the primary causes of age changes can no longer be thought of as resulting from\nevents occurring at the supracellular level, i.e., at cell hierarchies from the tissue level\nand greater. The cell is where the gerontological action lies. I believe therefore that\npurely descriptive studies done at the tissue, organ and whole animal level, as they\n358 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\npertain to the biology of aging, are less likely to yield important information on\nmechanism than studies done at the cell and molecular level. (1974: 39, italics added)\nIn other words, according to Hayflick, investigations of ageing would be most product-\nive when grounded in the methods of \u2018cytogerontology\u2019, the new field of research which\nHayflick himself was busy trying to define and delineate; but he also seemed intent on chal-\nlenging Shock\u2019s programme for the development of gerontology, first because Shock had\njustified his focus on individuals on the grounds that the cellular level concerned only a sub-\nset of the gerontological phenomena and, second, because the list of \u2018purely descriptive stud-\nies\u2019 of ageing presumably included the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (see also\nAchenbaum, 1995). There was more, however. If Shock\u2019s programme was underpinned\nby the need to distinguish between normal and pathological ageing, on Hayflick\u2019s vision\nthis would become a problematic endeavour:\nOne is forced to conclude that if all disease-related causes of death were to be resolved,\nthen the aging processes would present some clear physical manifestations well in\nadvance of death itself. The challenge, of course, is to separate disease-related changes\nfrom the basic biological changes that are a part of the aging process. Since\nfundamental aging processes most certainly contribute to or allow for the expression of\npathology, then the two concepts may be so closely intertwined as to make any clear\ndistinctions a futile exercise in semantics. (Hayflick, 1974: 43)\nThe question about the relationship between the normal and pathological which\nHayflick thus posed rested explicitly on Alex Comfort\u2019s well-established evolutionary\nexplanation of ageing (see Moreira and Palladino, 2008). Natural selection, Comfort\nargued, operated most forcefully on those phases of the life cycle which were related to\nreproduction, so that the expression of any deleterious mutations in these phases would\nbe targeted more strongly than their expression in post-reproductive phases. This, according\nto Comfort, led to an accumulation of deleterious genes whose expression occurred in the\nlater phases of the life cycle, eventually resulting in the genetic determination of the post-\nreproductive weakening of the organism commonly named \u2018ageing\u2019. From this evolutionary\nperspective, seeking to \u2018separate disease-related changes from the basic biological changes\nthat are a part of the aging process\u2019 was questionable, to say the least. Significantly, just\ntwo years after these critical declarations, Hayflick was mentioned as a possible first dir-\nector of the NIA, thus illustrating the force of his criticism of Shock\u2019s programme, but\nHayflick\u2019s accompanying ambition to totally reconfigure the organization of gerontological\nresearch may also have been the reason for its limited institutionalization. Thus, the first\ndirector of the NIA was not Hayflick, but Robert Butler, psychologist and author of the\nbest-selling and prize-winning book Why survive? Growing old in America (1975; see\nalso Ballenger, 2006).\nOne of the greatest challenges confronting Butler upon his appointment was the lack of\nresearch capacity and limited public interest in gerontology. Despite Butler\u2019s attempts to\nenrol policy makers and congressional committees, the NIA struggled to secure any steady\nstream of resources. Thus, when he suggested that \u2018research on aging has shifted from its\nexclusive disease orientation toward a more comprehensive investigation of the normal,\nphysiological changes with age\u2019 (Butler, 1977: 8, italics added), the evocation of normality\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n359\nwas related more to the need to re-articulate how the American public viewed older people\u2019s\nrole in society than to the needs of clinicians working with older people. The situation only\nchanged with the emergence of what Butler called the \u2018health politics of anguish\u2019 (Fox,\n1989: 82), an alliance of activists, clinicians and politicians who called public attention to\nthe abandonment experienced by sufferers of senile dementia and those around them.\nThis resulted in the prioritization of research into the causes and treatment of AD, particu-\nlarly through the NIA\u2019s extramural research programme, which embodied emerging, com-\npetition-driven innovation policies that were based on both collaborations between\nuniversities and pharmaceutical companies, and ideals of \u2018rational\u2019 therapeutic development\nfrom bench to bedside (Moreira, 2009). It should be noted that, despite Butler\u2019s later disen-\nchantment with the direction taken by the NIA, his own programme for the development of\ngerontology could be said to have facilitated the change insofar as it rested on the trans-\nformation of individual failures to adapt and age \u2018successfully\u2019 from a matter of psychic dis-\nposition into a matter of organic pathology (Ballenger, 2006). More importantly, however,\nwith the support thus gained, the NIA experienced an extraordinary influx of researchers\nfrom other areas of biomedical research. This helped to transform the NIA\u2019s place in the\nAmerican polity, but in the form of a highly visible disease-specific programme that eventu-\nally accounted for the majority of the NIA\u2019s budget. This caused considerable dissatisfaction\namong a number of gerontologists. As Richard Miller (2002) has noted, and plaintively so,\n\u2018senators\u2019 and voters\u2019 parents [die] of specific diseases\u2019 and are less likely to fund a general,\n\u2018basic\u2019 programme of research on ageing. In sum, AD firmly established the position of the\nNIA within the political and clinical worlds, but only by emphasizing the equation of ageing\nand illness. If gerontologists such as Butler, Hayflick and Miller felt that an opportunity had\nbeen missed, however, this situation also created the conditions for an unlikely alliance\nbetween programmes aiming to distinguish between normal and pathological ageing, on\nthe one hand, and investigations of ageing at the cellular and sub-cellular level, on the other\nhand.\nBiogerontology and the promise of health\nDuring the 1990s, the alignment of evolutionary models and genetic research which Richard\nDawkins\u2019s The selfish gene (1976) had by then popularized very successfully renewed geron-\ntologists\u2019 interest in the evolutionary understanding of ageing, especially because it seemed\nto promise a new articulation of the problems of old age and how to address them (see also\nNesse and Williams, 1996). This is powerfully illustrated by the increasing importance\nattached to Thomas Kirkwood\u2019s work.\nKirkwood (1977) re-articulated Alex Comfort\u2019s evolutionary explanation by combining\nmolecular and demographic analyses to advance the notion that the organism should be un-\nderstood as the product of a historical process involving the balancing of energetic invest-\nments in the somatic body, to enhance the chances of successful reproduction of the\ngerminal line, and the cost of these investments to the continuity of the germinal line. On\nthis understanding of ageing, attention is then directed toward the molecular mechanisms\ninvolved in the preservation of genomic integrity, or, as Kirkwood has put it, toward \u2018the\nevolved capacity of somatic cells to carry out effective maintenance and repair\u2019 (Kirkwood\n360 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\nand Austad, 2000: 235). Importantly, in this new vision, the business of gerontology is to\nenhance the ability of the individual to approximate the immortal germinal line, even if\nimmortality itself is irretrievably denied by the evolutionary history of the human species.\nThe hope is that this redefinition will at least result in maximizing the biological function-\nality of the individual up to the moment of death. Thus conceived, gerontology ceases to\nbe a field of clinical specialization concerned with the diseases of a distinct population,\nthe elderly, as these diseases are re-articulated as unfolding temporally on to antecedent\nrisk factors and biomolecular pathways. Biomolecular and demographic pathways of indivi-\nduals who might be \u2018at risk\u2019 of developing pathologies such as cardio-vascular disease, can-\ncer and dementia are traced backward, to the earliest possible molecular, behavioural or\nclinical manifestations, aiming to develop multiple preventative interventions. These pathol-\nogies thus become part of a wider set of \u2018degenerative diseases\u2019 that are only connected con-\ntingently to the organism\u2019s chronological age. Within this framework, all degenerative\ndiseases might be said to entail \u2018ageing\u2019, but in so expanding its domain of application the\nterm \u2018ageing\u2019 no longer identifies a distinct biological process of its own kind. Equally\nimportantly, because the domain of gerontology thus defined is resistive to any precise\ndelimitation, it can become an object of interest for all clinical practitioners involved in\nmanaging degenerative diseases, from the primary care practitioners controlling middle-\nage hypertension to the specialized clinicians required to train these practitioners in the\nassessment of the earliest symptoms of cardio-vascular weakening. Furthermore, geronto-\nlogy also offers opportunities of development to a great variety of actors in the market\nfor health care as investigation of the mechanisms involved in the onset of these degenera-\ntive diseases greatly expands opportunities for pharmaceutical companies because the\nthreshold of treatment moves ever backward to encompass a greater fraction of the popula-\ntion. This said, the investigation of these same mechanisms also offers opportunities to those\nproviding the wherewithal and support to secure \u2018healthy lifestyles\u2019 from birth to death. In\nso doing, biogerontology promises to deliver a central expectation of private and public\nhealth care insurers, namely reducing the prevalence of degenerative diseases so as to reduce\nthe aggregate cost of provision.\nImportantly, by drawing on evolutionary biology to explore organisms\u2019 life histories in\nrelation to the genome and the environment, the biogerontological programme enables links\nbetween the laboratory, preventative medicine and health maintenance programmes. One of\nthe key changes in the organization of research, clinical practice and policy at the end of the\ntwentieth century has been the shift from the \u2018problem of disease\u2019 to the \u2018problem of health\u2019.\nThis entails not only constructing an understanding of the molecular, individual and social\ndynamics that lead to illness, rather than just focusing on restoring health, but also reliance\non preventative therapeutic strategies and health promotion programmes. These in turn are\nsustained by enhanced surveillance technologies which regulate access to therapies and pro-\ngrammes by identifying risk factors or states and supporting individuals\u2019 reorganization of\ntheir conduct in light of such risks (Clarke et al., 2003; May et al., 2006; Rose, 2007).\nSignificantly, in so doing, biogerontologists differentiate themselves from the \u2018anti-ageing\u2019\nmovement and medicine (Olshansky et al., 2002; see also Fishman et al., 2008; Juengst\net al., 2003). While the latter argue for an interventionist approach to ageing, ageing being\nconceived in this case as a \u2018natural\u2019 but \u2018modifiable\u2019 process (Mykytyn, 2008), biogerontol-\nogists suggest that there is in fact nothing \u2018natural\u2019 about ageing. Instead, the plasticity of\nA G E I N G B E T W E E N G E R O N T O L O G Y A N D B I O M E D I C I N E j\nj\n361\nthe human organism, and in particular how first death and then ageing have been signifi-\ncantly postponed during the last few centuries, is where biogerontologists draw support\nto propose the expansion of public health measures to further this historical process.\nConsequently, in a recent public statement, a number of influential biogerontologists and\nrepresentatives of non-governmental charitable organizations have argued that:\n. . . the exploration of the mechanisms by which ageing can be postponed in laboratory\nmodels will yield new models of preventive medicine and health maintenance for\npeople throughout life, and the same research will also inform a deeper understanding\nof how established interventions, such as exercise and healthy nutrition, contribute to\nlifelong wellbeing. (Butler et al., 2008: 399)\nIn so doing, they call upon individuals identified through screening programmes and char-\nacterized through a variety of molecular and demographic markers to produce and maintain\ntheir own health. Such promises of health can only be realized, however, if research policies\nprovide the means to focus on the basic biology of ageing and abandon biomedicine and its\ndisease-driven business.\nConclusion\nDuring the past decade, discontent with the organization of research into the causes and\ntreatment of diseases associated with age has motivated highly visible public debates in\nboth the United States and the United Kingdom. In this context, a number of influential bio-\ngerontologists have offered an alternative to disease-specific programmes which calls into\nquestion both biomedicine and the historical opposition between biomedicine and public\nhealth. Such proposals, as we have argued elsewhere, could be taken as evidence of a trans-\nformation of socio-political forms of management whereby:\n. . . the individual of the 19th-century biopolitical imaginary, a human body whose\nbiological constitution was irremediably fixed at birth, is giving way to an\nunderstanding of the human body as an assembly of biomolecular components that\ncan be . . . recombined so as to maximize the resultant unit\u2019s cultural, social and\npolitical productivity. (Moreira and Palladino, 2008: 21)\nWhether and how the proposed link between the laboratory, preventative medicine and\nhealth maintenance programmes will work in practice, however, is a matter of empirical\ncase studies of the development, mediation and use of emerging gerontological technologies.\nFurthermore, as we have argued in this article, such studies should not be underpinned by a\ncritical appraisal of biogerontology as a \u2018biomedicalization of ageing\u2019, because biogerontol-\nogy positions itself outside the institutions of biomedicine. In other words, the challenge for\nfuture studies will be to understand how the current uncertainties of the biogerontological\nprogramme play out in multiple social and political arenas.\nFinally, some of the uncertainty involved in the future development of the biogeronto-\nlogical programme is evident in the reluctance with which the British government has\ngreeted some of the recommendations advanced in the House of Lords report Ageing: Sci-\nentific aspects (2005). The Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords was\n362 j\nj\nT I A G O M O R E I R A A N D P A O L O P A L L A D I N O\nparticularly surprised that it was not the Science Secretary who responded to its report, a\nreport on the \u2018scientific aspects of ageing\u2019 (italics added), but the Minister for Work and\nPensions, who argued that \u2018old age\u2019 had long been a major concern of the government\nand that it had already invested very heavily in the improvement of health and social\ncare, as well as pensions. Citing a memorandum by one of the chief scientific advisers\ninvolved in the preparation of the report, Thomas Kirkwood, the Science and Technology\nCommittee wrote:\nIt is particularly disappointing that the Government seem to wish to \u2018pigeon-hole\u2019\nageing research, as if ageing were an isolated, discrete problem, and that research into\nageing must necessarily compete with research into other areas. Thus the response\nreproduces the familiar mantra that \u2018given finite resources, there will always be a need\nto balance competing priorities for research\u2019. As we sought to demonstrate in our\nReport\u2014a point repeated by Professor Kirkwood in his written comments\u2014ageing is a\ncontinuum, affecting all of us all the time. He also reiterates the point made in our\nReport, that generic research into the process of ageing, far from being in competition\nwith research into specific conditions affecting older people, may be \u2018the most direct\nroute to developing novel interventions and therapies\u2019. There is no sign of such holistic\nthinking in the Government response. (House of Lords, 2006a)\nThe Science and Technology Committee\u2019s contrast between \u2018specific conditions affecting\nolder people\u2019 and the notion that \u2018ageing is a continuum, affecting all of us all the time\u2019 was\ninformed by Kirkwood\u2019s more specific observation that, \u2018there are scientific connections\nbetween birth, early years, childhood and adolescence that have major impacts on health\nand quality of life in middle and old age. These need much greater attention . . .\u2019 (House\nof Lords, 2006b). What might explain the Department of Work and Pensions\u2019 rejection of\nthe House of Lords\u2019 recommendations may be that the department remains committed to\nthe needs of a specific subset of the population, the chronologically aged and their distinct-\nive social problems. If this surmise is correct, it indicates that there are significant obstacles\nto the biogerontological programme and that they stem from the coexistence of biopolitical\nand disciplinary modes of governance (Moreira and Palladino, 2005).\nReferences\nAchenbaum, A.W.
