Introduction\nSouthern Hemisphere subpolar gyres (hereafter subpolar gyres) are cyclonic ocean cir-18\nculations that circulate to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and are19\nbounded by the Antarctic continent. These gyres are important as sites of dense water20\nproduction and export, significant ice production and advection, and as regions of interme-21\ndiate climate separating the glaciated Antarctic continent from the comparatively warm22\nwaters of the ACC. Consequently, prediction of the climate evolution of Antarctica and23\nits impact on lower-latitude (including planetary) climate requires accurate representation24\nand validation of the subpolar gyres. However, the subpolar gyres are difficult locations25\nfrom which to obtain measurements since the perennial ice cover and harsh climate makes26\nobservations very difficult. In this study, we investigate the simulated subpolar gyres and27\nexamine the relative roles of wind forcing and density structure in determining the gyre28\nstructures and strengths, through analysing the output of IPCC AR4 coupled climate29\nmodels.30\nThere are two conventionally defined subpolar gyres, i.e., the Weddell Gyre (WG) and31\nthe Ross Gyre (RG). The WG is a zonally elongated cyclonic gyre, which extends from the32\nAntarctic Peninsula (AP) to immediately west of the Kerguelen Plateau (KP) [Gordon33\net al. 1981; Park and Gambe\u00b4roni 1995]. Its meridional extent is relatively small, being34\nbounded by the Antarctic continent and the South Scotia Ridge, North Weddell Ridge,35\nand the Southwest Indian Ridge. The RG is a compact cyclonic gyre in the Ross Sea36\nembayment [Gouretski 1998]. Recently, based on hydrographic data and direct-velocity37\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nX - 4 WANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES\nmeasurements, McCartney and Donohue [2007] suggested that there is a deep cyclonic38\ngyre in the Australian-Antarctic basin, i.e., the Australian-Antarctic Gyre (AG).39\nIt has been thought that subpolar gyres are primarily driven by wind and buoyancy40\nforcing, and are constrained by topography. Beckmann et al. [1999] used a coupled ocean-41\nice regional model to demonstrate the important role of wind forcing in driving the WG.42\nHere, we analyse the output of the IPCC AR4 coupled climate models to investigate the43\nrelative roles of wind forcing and density structure in the setting of the gyre strengths in44\nthese models.45\n2. Results\n2.1. Strengths of the subpolar gyres\nThe strengths of the WG, RG and AG in 20 IPCC AR4 models are listed46\nin Table 1. The descriptions of these models can be found at http:\/\/www-47\npcmdi.llnl.gov\/ipcc\/model documentation\/ipcc model documentation.php. We analyze48\nthe 50-year means (1950-1999) from their 20th century runs. The gyre strengths are de-49\nfined as the maximum westward transports across the Prime Meridian, 150oW and 110oE50\nfor the WG, RG, and AG respectively, in order to compare the simulated results with51\nthe available observational estimates across these longitudes. The transports across these52\nthree longitudes are generally slightly lower than the transports across the longitudes of53\nthe gyre centres, and we note that there are good linear relationships between the former54\nand the latter in these models.55\nCarmack and Foster [1975] estimated the strength of the WG as 97 Sv using current-56\nmeter referencing. Gordon et al. [1981] used wind stress data to give an estimation of57\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nWANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES X - 5\n76 Sv. By using shipboard acoustic Doppler current profilers (SADCP) data, Schro\u00a8der58\nand Fahrbach [1999] estimated the westward transport at the Prime Meridian of 66 Sv.59\nSome earlier estimations without using SADCP data and with bottom level of no motion60\nhad less than half that value. Based on 4.5 year-duration moored current measurements,61\nKlatt et al. [2005] gave the updated westward transport of 56 \u00b1 8 Sv across the Prime62\nMeridian. The simulated WG strength ranges from 1.6 Sv to 93.3 Sv in the 20 models63\nwith most models having a weaker WG than that observed.64\nFor the RG, an estimate using hydrographic data with the ocean bottom as refer-65\nence level of no motion gave the baroclinic transport of 8.5 Sv across 150oW [Gouretski66\n1999]. However, in the subpolar region with weak stratification and equivalent barotropic67\nstructure, neglecting the barotropic component of velocity can lead to a significant un-68\nderestimation of the total transport [Park and Gambe\u00b4roni 1995]. Indeed, for the WG it69\nhas been noted that the baroclinic westward transport across the Prime Meridian is only70\naround one third of the total transport [Klatt et al. 2005]. If the same were true of the RG71\n(for which fewer data exist), the total transport across 150oW could be very much larger72\nthan the stated baroclinic transport. Accordingly, those models that give the maximum73\ntransports of lower than or close to 8.5 Sv possibly underestimate the strength of the RG.74\nEarly studies using hydrographic data did not show clearly the existence of the75\nAG. Through resolving the barotropic component, the altimeter data from the76\nTOPEX\/POSEIDON mission suggest that there is a cyclonic subpolar gyre to the east77\nof the KP [Park and Gambe\u00b4roni 1995]. 12 models produce the westward transport across78\n110oE of more than 5 Sv, supporting the existence of the AG. Using summer hydrographic79\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nX - 6 WANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES\ndata and independent direct-velocity measurements, McCartney and Donohue [2007] es-80\ntimated the westward flow across 110oE as 76 \u00b1 26 Sv, much higher than those simulated81\nby all models.82\n2.2. Structures of the subpolar gyres\nVertically integrated zonal transports (westward negative) in 6 selected models are83\nshown in Fig. 1. These models are selected to cover the range of simulated gyre strengths:84\nmodels 6 and 20 with intermediate WG strengths or close to that observed, models 9 and85\n14 with very weak WG, and models 12 and 15 with very strong WG. By only showing the86\nnegative total transport (net westward transport), we are able to clearly see the spatial87\nstructures of the subpolar gyres.88\nModels 6, 12, 15 and 20 produce the structure with gyres in the Weddell-Enderby basin,89\nthe Ross Sea, and the Australia-Antarctic basin, although there are no clear boundaries90\nbetween two gyres in some cases. Whilst the western boundary of the WG is fixed by the91\nAP, its eastern boundary is less consistent between the models. Model 20 has its eastern92\nboundary at around 45oE, but the WG in model 14 extends further east to the west side93\nof the KP. For models 6, 12 and 15, the westward flow along the Antarctic coast even94\nextends from the Australian-Antarctic basin. The large variation of the eastern boundary95\nis likely caused by different simulations of the interactions between the ACC and the KP.96\nThe RG fills the Ross Sea, with its eastern boundary being at about 140oW. Although97\nits eastern limb extends into the Bellingshausen and the Amundsen Sea in models 6, 12,98\n15 and 20, the meridional extents of westward flow in models 6, 12 and 20 are small.99\nAnalysis of hydrographic data shows that the eastern boundary of the RG is at 140oW,100\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nWANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES X - 7\nbeing constrained by bottom topography [Gouretski 1999]. Unlike the WG, the RG has101\nno pronounced western boundary, due to the lack of a meridional barrier. In models 15102\nand 20, the westward flow extends into the Australian-Antarctic basin.103\nThe simulations of the AG differ considerably in these models, ranging from no cyclonic104\ncirculation in models 9 and 14 to a strong cyclonic circulation in model 12. It is suggested105\nby models 6, 15 and 20 that the western boundary is at the east side of the KP, where106\nthere is an observed northward transport of 48 Sv [McCartney and Donohue 2007], but107\nno consistent eastern boundary.108\nA double cell structure of the WG with two sub-gyre centres sitting on each side of109\nthe Prime Meridian can be seen in model 6, 15 and 20. This double cell structure was110\nobserved by Orsi et al. [1993] and simulated by Beckmann et al. [1999]. The westward111\npassing flow through the Princess Elizabeth Trough, to the south of the KP at around112\n80oE, that bridges the WG and the AG, is simulated by models 6, 12 and 15, and echoes113\nthe observation of McCartney and Donohue [2007]. The difference in the simulations of114\nthis passing flow reflects different representations of the dynamic topographic effects of115\nthe KP.116\nIt is not clear whether the continuous westward flow from the Ross Sea to the Australian-117\nAntarctic basin exists in reality. If there is an uninterrupted westward flow from the west118\nside to the east side of the AP, there exists a \u201csupergyre\u201d structure around Antarctica,119\nwith three major localized gyres in the Weddell-Enderby basin, the Ross Sea and the120\nAustralian-Antarctic basin. Unlike the Northern Hemisphere subpolar gyres, the southern121\nsubpolar gyres are less bounded by continents in the zonal direction.122\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nX - 8 WANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES\n2.3. Wind-driven versus density-driven subpolar gyres\nWe plot the gyre strengths against the wind stress curls for the WG, RG, and AG in Fig.123\n2. The wind stress curls are area averaged values over three domains from the Antarctic124\ncoast to 55oS, and from 60oW to 60oE for the WG, from 165oE to 135oW for the RG, and125\nfrom 80oE to 165oE for the AG respectively.126\nAll models produce negative wind stress curls, i.e., cyclonic atmospheric circulations,127\nover the three domains, except model 8 that produces a slightly positive value in the128\nAustralian-Antarctic basin. The curls are very different, with the curls in some models129\nbeing about three or four times larger than the values of others. Although the best linear130\nfits do suggest a slight tendency for stronger gyre strengths with increasing wind forcing131\nover the WG and RG, the very large scatters and the reversed relationship for the AG132\nindicate that the Sverdrup balance does not hold for the subpolar gyres. Further, no clear133\nrelationships can be found between the gyre strengths and the area-integrated westward134\nwind stress or the areas of westward wind stress (not shown). These results indicate that135\nthe subpolar gyres are not set by wind forcing.136\nFig. 3 shows the relationships between the gyre strengths and the meridional density137\ngradients for the three gyres. The potential density is first vertically averaged over the138\nupper 1000 m, and then zonally averaged over a specific longitudinal span (from 30oW139\nto 30oE for the WG, 180oE to 120oW for the RG, and 80oE to 140oE for the AG). The140\nmeridional density gradient is then obtained by subtracting the averaged potential density141\nat a higher latitude (gyre rim) (70oS, 75oS and 66oS respectively for the WG, RG and142\nAG) from that at a lower latitude (gyre centre) (62oS, 70oS, and 60oS respectively for the143\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nWANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES X - 9\nWG, RG and AG). Thus, a positive meridional density gradient means denser water in144\nthe north (gyre centre) and lighter water in the south (gyre rim), i.e., a domed isopycnal145\nstructure.146\nFor all the three gyres, the best linear fits indicate a consistent relationship between147\nthe gyre strength and the meridional density gradient: the lighter upper layer water in148\nthe south is associated with the stronger subpolar gyres. This relationship is particularly149\nclear for the WG, the strongest of the southern subpolar gyres.150\nFrom Fig. 2a, we see that models 10, 17 and 18 have almost the same wind stress151\ncurl, but very different WG strengths. This is due to very different meridional density152\ngradients in these models, as seen from Fig. 3a. For other models with very different153\ngyre strengths and almost the same value of wind stress curl (such as 1, 5 and 15; 20154\nand 12), this is also the case. Some exceptions in Fig. 3a and relatively large scatters155\nin Fig. 3b and 3c imply that the effects of other dynamical processes are not negligible156\nin some cases. Nevertheless, by considering the highly diverse model configurations and157\nparameterizations of subgrid processes in the 20 IPCC AR4 models, it is clear that the158\ngyre strengths are mainly determined by the meridional density gradients, particularly159\nfor the WG.160\nFig. 4 shows the dependence of the derived meridional density gradients on the merid-161\nional gradients of potential temperature and salinity for the WG. All models, except 6162\nand 15, produce warmer temperatures in the north than the south (Fig 4a). Most models163\nalso simulate saltier (and therefore denser) water in the north compared with the south164\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nX - 10 WANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES\n(Fig. 4b). The very small scatters from the best linear fit in Fig. 4b clearly demonstrate165\nthat salinity gradients contribute dominantly to the density gradients.166\nFurther analysis does not reveal a clear relationship between the surface freshwater167\nforcing and salinity structure (not shown), suggesting that oceanic processes (including168\nsubgrid scale mixing processes) are also important in determining the salinity structure169\nof the gyres.170\n3. Concluding remarks\nWe have presented the simulated subpolar gyres in 20 IPCC AR4 coupled climate171\nmodels, and have compared the simulated gyres with the best available observational172\nresults. The models simulate the existence of three southern subpolar gyres, i.e., the WG,173\nthe RG, and the AG, however there being considerable discrepancies in the simulated gyre174\nstrengths and structures.175\nThe observed double cell structure of theWG is simulated by some models. The different176\nrepresentations of the dynamical topographic effects of the KP lead to diverse simulations177\nof the eastern boundary of the WG and the westward passing flow through the Princess178\nElizabeth Trough. Some models simulate the presence of a subpolar \u201csupergyre\u201d, with179\nobvious connectivity between the three subpolar gyres.180\nFurther analysis shows that the link between the simulated gyre strengths and wind181\nstress curls is very weak, indicating that the Sverdrup balance does not hold for the182\nsubpolar gyres. Instead, the gyre strength is mainly determined by the meridional density183\ngradient in the subpolar area (this is particularly so for the WG), which itself depends184\npredominantly on the salinity gradient.185\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nWANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES X - 11\nIt has been found that the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is not sensitive to wind stress186\nforcing [Bryan et al. 1995]. The recent observed decline of this gyre is attributed to the187\nwarming at the gyre centre, which leads to the decay of its domed isopycnal structure,188\ndespite wind stress curl increasing in this area [Ha\u00a8kkinen and Rhines 2004]. These findings189\nsuggest that buoyancy forcing plays a more important role than wind forcing in driving190\nthe subpolar gyre in the North Atlantic. Our results are consistent with these findings.191\nHowever, it is important to note that the seawater temperature in the southern subpolar192\ngyres is much colder than that in their northern counterparts. Consequently, the southern193\nsubpolar gyres are much more sensitive to salinity changes.194\nSouthern high latitude salinity structure is determined by salt transport in the ocean195\nand by freshwater forcing from surface processes, such as atmospheric moisture transport,196\nsea ice melting\/freezing, and even the mass balance of ice shelf or continental ice. A correct197\nsimulation of the southern subpolar gyres needs a complete understanding of water cycle198\nin the southern high latitudes that involves these processes. Although challenging, this is199\nneeded if coupled climate models are to reliably simulate the structure and circulation of200\nthe subpolar gyres, and hence their impacts on e.g. dense water production and export,201\nand ice formation and advection.202\nAs a final point, it should be noted that hydrographic data in the southern high lat-203\nitudes have historically been obtained almost exclusively during austral summer season.204\nHowever, due to sea ice and atmospheric processes, salinity structure during the sum-205\nmer can be very different from that during other seasons, with consequences for gyre206\nD R A F T June 13, 2008, 10:27am D R A F T\nX - 12 WANG ET AL.: SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUBPOLAR GYRES\nstrengths. This should be carefully considered when deriving the climatology of subpolar207\nocean circulation using the summer-dominated hydrographic data.208\nAcknowledgments.
