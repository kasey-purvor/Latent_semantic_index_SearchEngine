Close to magmatic activity, volcanic emanations are the surface expressions of 35 \nporphyry-Cu and high-sulphidation epithermal-Au mineralizing processes at depth 36 \n(Hedenquist et al., 1993). Located farther from the magmatic source are low-sulphidation 37 \n(LS) epithermal deposits, for which the Broadlands\u2013Ohaaki geothermal system is the 38 \nparadigm (e.g. Simmons and Browne, 2000). Generally, in LS mineralization, fluid inclusions 39 \ndocument low-salinity fluids (< 1 wt % dissolved salts + CO2) and these are equivalent to the 40 \nlow-chorinity (< 1000 ppm) fluids seen in Broadlands-type geothermal systems. However, 41 \nthey also identify saline fluids (up to 15 wt % salts) and, in this case, there are no documented 42 \nactive analogues (Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994). Conversely, deep water (> 1000 m) 43 \ngeothermal systems, such as TAG (e.g. You and Bickle, 1998) are exemplars for VHMS 44 \ndeposits. However, where boiling submarine geothermal fluids vent into shallow water (< 200 45 \nm) mineralization is epithermal in style (Stoffers et al., 1999), but there are no clearly defined 46 \nancient equivalents (Huston, 2000). Thus, in both the submarine and subaerial environments 47 \nthere is a missing link between active geothermal systems and their ancient counterparts. 48 \nBelow, we provide new strontium isotope data and summarize features of epithermal systems 49 \non Milos island. By comparing these with well-characterised modern analogues we suggest 50 \nthat active geothermal systems with entrained seawater, such as those in the Aegean arc 51 \n(Aegean arc-type), are an alternative to the Broadlands\u2013Ohaaki LS paradigm in the scheme of 52 \nintrusion-centred hydrothermal systems.  53 \nThe Aegean arc 54 \nThe Aegean arc is a zone of Pliocene to modern volcanism related to active back-arc 55 \nextension caused by the subduction of the African plate beneath the Aegean micro-plate (e.g. 56 \nPe-Piper and Piper, 2002). It is built on continental crust, comprises seven major volcanic 57 \ncentres and is located 120\u2013250 km north of the Hellenic trench (Fig. 1). The volcanic rocks 58 \nare calc-alkaline with localised high-K variants and range from basalt to rhyolite in 59 \ncomposition, with dominant andesites and dacites. Present day hydrothermal activity 60 \ncomprises both low-enthalpy (Aegina, Sousaki, Methana) and high-enthalpy systems (Milos, 61 \nNisyros). 62 \nNaden J, Kilias, SP & Darbyshire, DPF: Geology manuscript \nPage 3 of 12 \nMilos geology and LS epithermal Au-Ag mineralization  63 \nUpper Pliocene (2.66 \u00b1 0.07 Ma; Stewart and McPhie, 2003) submarine and Late Pleistocene 64 \nto present (1.9\u20130.1 Ma) subaerial volcanic rocks overlay Mesozoic metamorphic basement 65 \nand Upper Miocene\u2013Lower Pliocene marine sediments, and record a transition from a shallow 66 \nsubmarine (< 200 m) to subaerial volcanic setting (Fytikas et al., 1986; Rinaldi and Venuti, 67 \n2003; Stewart and McPhie, 2003). Emergence probably occurred at 1.44 \u00b1 0.08 Ma (Stewart 68 \nand McPhie, 2003). Plutonic rocks are not known on Milos and have only been reported as 69 \nignimbrite-hosted granitic xenoliths from the nearby islet of Kimolos (Pe-Piper and Piper, 70 \n2002).  71 \nThe oldest submarine volcanic rocks occur on western Milos and host LS Au\u2013Ag 72 \nmineralization (the Profitis Ilias [PI]\u2013Chondro Vouno [CV] epithermal system), which 73 \nextends over a 20 km2 area (this study; Kilias et al., 2001). Fluid inclusion data show the 74 \nhydrothermal fluids underwent extreme boiling and vaporisation. Importantly, final ice-75 \nmelting (Tmice) data show that 70 % of the fluid inclusions have net salinities in excess of 76 \nseawater (Tab. 1), showing that throughout its lifespan, fluids in the system were saline. The 77 \ntops of the paleosystem (now ~600 masl) show crustiform\/colloform quartz\u2013barite\u00b1alunite 78 \nveins and quartz-cemented breccias, with locally high gold (PI: 56 ppm; CV: 250 ppm) and 79 \nsilver (PI:  197 ppm; CV: 90 ppm). Deeper in the system (now ~300 masl), the mineralization 80 \nis dominated by a base-metal-bearing stockwork. Elevated gold values at PI are concentrated 81 \nabove the base metal zone and are spatially related to boiling (Kilias et al., 2001).  82 \nActive geothermal system 83 \nIn the active geothermal system (Liakopoulos, 1987; Pflumio et al., 1991), data indicate a 84 \ntwo-component reservoir: (1) A high enthalpy system with deep seawater recharge located 1\u201385 \n2 km below sea-level. Reservoir temperatures range 250\u2013350 \u00baC and salinities can be 86 \nsignificantly higher than seawater (up to 9 wt % salts). This results from Rayleigh distillation 87 \nas seawater percolates, through progressively hotter rocks, into the reservoir. Due to its high 88 \nsalinity, venting of the deep geothermal fluid is accompanied by boiling close to the top of the 89 \nreservoir and in some cases the reservoir may be two-phase. (2) A shallow reservoir (100\u2013175 90 \n\u00baC) overlies the high-enthalpy system. It is located close to sea-level, recharged by meteoric 91 \nwater and seawater intrusion, is commonly saline (up to 5 wt % salts) and heated by gas 92 \nescapes from the underlying deep reservoir. Seawater, as a major component of both the deep 93 \nNaden J, Kilias, SP & Darbyshire, DPF: Geology manuscript \nPage 4 of 12 \nand shallow reservoirs, is documented on the basis of 87Sr\/86Sr and \u03b4D\u2013\u03b418O\u2013Cl systematics 94 \n(Pflumio et al., 1991). In the shallow (<100 m) submarine environment, venting geothermal 95 \nfluids contain suspended particulate matter strongly enriched in Fe, Mn, Si and Ba and locally 96 \ndeposit APS minerals, pyrite, marcasite, barite, gypsum, and calcite (Baltatzis et al., 2001; 97 \nVarnavas et al., 2000). In addition, the deep reservoir is metalliferous (Pb: 180 ppb; Zn: 1458 98 \nppb) (Christanis and Seymour, 1995) and has gold concentrations in the region of 0.3 ppb 99 \n(Liakopoulos, 1987).  100 \nStrontium isotopes 101 \nSr-isotope data show that the least altered igneous rocks have low 87Sr\/86Sr, whereas their 102 \nhydrothermally altered counterparts are closer to a seawater signature (Fig. 2). The basement 103 \nrocks have variable strontium ratios (0.7033\u20130.7136)) (Fig. 2). In the modern system, 104 \n87Sr\/86Sr in the fluids vary from 0.7092\u20130.7102 (Pflumio et al., 1991). Barites from the 105 \nProfitis Ilias mineralization display similar 87Sr\/86Sr to the modern system (Fig. 2). All values 106 \nfor geothermal water and hydrothermal minerals are slightly more radiogenic than seawater 107 \nbut relatively constant. 108 \nDiscussion 109 \nSeawater as a fluid component on Milos 110 \nTmice in fluid inclusions provides information on salinity. However, above \u20131.5 \u00baC, it is unable 111 \nto distinguish between dissolved salt (< 2.5 wt % NaCl eq.) and gas (< 4.4 wt % CO2 eq.). 112 \nThis permits gas-charged low-chlorinity terrestrial geothermal systems to be the paradigm for 113 \nLS epithermal mineralization, as excess chlorinity can be assigned to dissolved gas 114 \n(Hedenquist and Henley, 1985). Moreover, in Broadlands\u2013Ohaaki-type geothermal systems 115 \nderivation of chlorinities in excess of 5000 ppm through fluid\u2013rock interaction is extremely 116 \ndifficult and where high salinities are recorded they are attributed to boiling to dryness and 117 \nhave a localised effect (Simmons and Browne, 1997). Hence, when comparing ancient 118 \nsystems with Broadlands\u2013Ohaaki-type equivalents, when the apparent salinity is up to 3\u20134 wt 119 \n% NaCl eq there is an implicit requirement to assign freezing point depressions to dissolved 120 \ngas rather than chlorinity. However, in our case > 70 % of the fluid inclusions have net 121 \nsalinities in excess of 3.5 wt % NaCl eq (Tab. 1). Thus, we cannot assign excess Tmice to 122 \ndissolved gas. Nonetheless, our high salinities have to be explained. There are three main 123 \nsodium and chlorine reservoirs available to large-scale geothermal systems: (1) evaporites and 124 \nNaden J, Kilias, SP & Darbyshire, DPF: Geology manuscript \nPage 5 of 12 \nevaporitic sediments (2) magmatic brines and (3) seawater. An evaporitic origin of salinity is 125 \nconsidered highly improbable, as there is no record of saliferous rocks within the Milos 126 \nsediments. Concerning a magmatic brine, it is estimated that during its lifetime a geothermal 127 \nsystems turns over between 106\u00b11 km3 of water (Barnes and Seward, 1997). If it is assumed 128 \nthat andesitic magmas contain about 1000 ppm chlorine, then approximately 107\u00b11 km3 of 129 \nmagma would be required maintain salinities in the geothermal system at 9 wt % NaCl. This 130 \nis not impossible, but on Milos, geological and geophysical evidence is lacking (Pe-Piper and 131 \nPiper 2002). Thus, a magmatic origin of salinity is also considered unlikely. This leaves a 132 \nseawater origin for Na and Cl. We consider that the chemical similarities between the ancient 133 \nand modern systems on Milos (see above) support a seawater origin for the PI\u2013CV epithermal 134 \nfluids. 135 \nComparison of \u03b4D\u2013\u03b418O of inclusion fluids from the Profitis Ilias epithermal mineralization 136 \nand several active geothermal systems associated with emergent volcanoes reveals remarkable 137 \nsimilarities (Fig. 3). In the active systems, the geothermal fluids have a three component 138 \nsource (sea, meteoric and magmatic) and the waters fall in a zone projecting from the 139 \nmeteoric water line to values intermediate to seawater and volcanic-arc gases (Fig. 3). The 140 \nfluid inclusion data for the Profitis Ilias LS mineralization show an analogous trend and lie in 141 \na similar zone; this is in sharp contrast to typical LS mineralization where stable isotope data 142 \nshow 18O-shifted fluids at constant \u03b4D (see Broadlands field in Fig. 3).  143 \nIn terms of strontium isotope data (Fig. 2, the basement metamorphic sequence has 87Sr\/86Sr 144 \n(0.7033\u20130.7137) encompassing the entire range, permitting a variety of fluid\u2013rock interaction 145 \ninterpretations. However, we think the clustering of measured 87Sr\/86Sr for the modern 146 \ngeothermal fluids (0.7092\u20130.7100) and mineralization (0.7096\u20130.7100 [epithermal Au\u2013Ag]; 147 \n0.7092\u20130.7098 [Mn\u2013Ba] close to the value for late-Pliocene seawater (0.7090\u201370906), also 148 \nindicates of a seawater source. In addition, as 87Sr\/86Sr for the modern and ancient systems are 149 \nsignificantly different from most of the unaltered igneous rocks (0.7050\u20130.7080) mitigates 150 \nfurther against a magmatic fluid source. Indeed, most of the 87Sr\/86Sr (0.7082\u20130.7098) for 151 \nhydrothermally altered igneous rocks cluster within or close to the range recorded by the 152 \nmodern geothermal fluids and seawater. 153 \nTaken together, the above lines of evidence show that in addition to being a fundamental 154 \ncomponent in the active system, seawater has played a key role in LS mineralization. 155 \nNaden J, Kilias, SP & Darbyshire, DPF: Geology manuscript \nPage 6 of 12 \nHybrid epithermal systems and modern analogues 156 \nIt is clear that Broadlands\u2013Ohaaki-type meteoric geothermal systems are not a valid analogue 157 \nfor the Milos Au\u2013Ag mineralization and for moderately saline (> 15 000 ppm NaCl eq.) LS 158 \nepithermal mineralization in general. Furthermore, there is a missing link between saline 159 \nepithermal LS systems and their modern counterparts. We suggest that the best candidates, 160 \nwhich recognize the key parameters of consistently high fluid inclusion salinities, \u03b4D\u2013\u03b418O 161 \nsystematics indicating seawater and a seawater Sr isotope signature, are geothermal systems 162 \nwith entrained seawater. Typical examples are the active systems on Milos and Nisyros (Fig. 163 \n3). These analogues are hybrids, containing elements of both submarine and terrestrial 164 \ngeothermal systems. Indeed, the occurrence of fossil hybrid systems is predicted (Huston, 165 \n2000) though, to date, no ancient equivalents have been clearly identified. Here, in the 166 \nemergent environment, circulating sea and meteoric water are the main fluid components. The 167 \nfluids boil and result in auriferous quartz veins with epithermal textures and proximal quartz-168 \nadularia, intermediate quartz\u2013sericite\u2013pyrite and distal propylitic\/quartz\u2013albite alteration 169 \nhalos\u2014features that are comparable to the Milos epithermal mineralization. Thus, we suggest 170 \nthat epithermal mineralization where the involvement of seawater can be clearly demonstrated 171 \n(e.g. Milos) are good candidates for fossil hybrid epithermal systems, and active geothermal 172 \nsystems with entrained seawater such as the Aegean-arc type, are their modern analogues. 173 \nFeatures of hybrid epithermal systems can be reconstructed by putting geothermal systems 174 \nassociated with emergent volcanoes into a conceptual framework. Fig. 4 illustrates the 175 \nmodel\u2014gold-bearing epithermal veins are located between a shallow low-temperature (100\u2013176 \n175 \u00baC) steam-heated zone recharged by meteoric water and seawater intrusion, and a deep, 177 \nseawater recharged, higher-temperature (250\u2013350 \u00baC) base-metal bearing reservoir.  178 \nConcluding remarks 179 \nBroadlands-type models are not appropriate for LS epithermal systems with elevated salinities 180 \nthat cannot be reasonably explained by dissolved gas or localised boiling to dryness. 181 \nMoreover, where high salinities of this nature are encountered, an explanation for them must 182 \nbe sought. One possibility is a seawater origin for the hydrothermal fluids, though to use this 183 \nexplanation, other parameters have to be consistent. In the case of Milos, the epithermal 184 \nmineralization can be explained by analogy to seawater-entrained geothermal systems 185 \nassociated with emergent volcanoes (e.g. Nisyros, Milos) and the mineralization data 186 \nNaden J, Kilias, SP & Darbyshire, DPF: Geology manuscript \nPage 7 of 12 \n(geologic, isotope and fluid inclusion) are in accord with this model. We suggest that our 187 \nAegean-arc model should be considered as an additional paradigm in the scheme of intrusion-188 \ncentred metallogenesis. Moreover, it may provide a link between submarine and terrestrial 189 \nmineralization processes. Appropriate indicators for its use are fluid inclusion data showing 190 \nconsistently elevated salinities (> 3.5 wt % NaCl eq.) and mineralization hosted in submarine 191 \nor transitional to subaerial volcanic rocks in an island arc tectonic setting. However, it must 192 \nbe stressed that these are not definitive and other corroborating data must be sought, in our 193 \ncase, strontium isotope, \u03b4D and \u03b418O analyses. 194 \nAcknowledgements 195 \nThis work was in part funded by a Marie Curie Experienced Researcher Fellowship to JN 196 \n(HPMF-CT-2000-00762) and University of Athens Research Committee Grants to SPK (KA 197 \n70\/4\/3373 and KA 70\/4\/6425).
