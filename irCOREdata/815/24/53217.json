Introduction \nOwing to their unique characteristics, lasers have the propensity to be employed for the non-contact \nprocessing of materials which are otherwise difficult to process. Concrete is a composite material \nconsisting of an array of fine and coarse aggregate pieces embedded within an ordinary Portland \ncement (OPC) matrix. Consequently the processing and surface treatment of OPC surface of concrete \ncan be an arduous task.  \nTo date, many studies have been carried out to investigate the laser processing of concrete. Most of \nthe research, however, has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using \nhigh power CO2 lasers, most prominently with regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning [1-3]. Also, \nas part of nuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [4-7] conducted much research to determine the \nworkability of several laser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete \nsurfaces. Such techniques experimented with were: direct glazing of the concrete, single and multiple \nlayer fusion cladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding. In addition, Johnston et al. [8] have \nreported on the successful removal of the surface layer of concrete (scabbling) by means of Nd:YAG \nand CO2 laser radiation. Work by Sugimoto et al. [9] focused upon modifying the surface appearance \nand surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. The laser treatment \nproduced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and appearance unique to laser treatment. \nThe resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of the post-process cement based \nmaterials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [10]. Borodina et al. [11] has carried out \ninvestigations into the structural changes within the composition of zirconia concrete caused by \nsurface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural changes, phase changes and the \nabsorptivity characteristics. In all of these studies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity \nformation were found to be major problems undermining the performance of the laser treated surface \nlayer. \nThis present work is concerned with the utilisation of the relatively novel 2.5 kW high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) to generate a surface glaze on the OPC surface layer of concrete, and the effects thereof \non the OPC\u2019s mechanical, physical and chemical properties. In addition, the unique effects of \nprocessing using a relatively large beam geometry are examined. The ultimate aim of this \ninvestigation is to facilitate the hitherto impossible task of effectively generating a durable and long-\nlasting surface seal on the concrete, thereby extending the life and applications base of the concrete.  \n 2. Experimental procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a 2.5 kW HPDL (Rofin-Sinar, DL-025), emitting at 940nm.               \nThe defocused laser beam was fired directly onto the samples with rectangular beams of up to               \n6mm x 40mm with powers ranging from 0.5-2.5 kW. The laser head assembly and focusing optics are \nshown schematically in Fig. 1. The beam was traversed across the samples by means of mounting the \nassembly head onto the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC table.  The defocused laser beam was thus fired across \nthe \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of the concrete by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the \nx- and y-axis of the CNC table at speeds of 240-1800 mm\/min, whilst 20 l\/min of coaxially blown Ar \ngas was used to shield the laser optics. \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete. For the purpose of \nexperimental convenience the as-received concrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x \n20mm) prior to laser treatment. The composition of the concrete by volume is as follows: 20mm \nlimestone aggregate (40%), 10mm limestone aggregate (14 %), zone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) \nand particulate fine aggregate (7%). \nTo determine the characteristics of the glazes, the HPDL treated concrete samples were examined \nusing optical microscopy. Mechanical and chemical testing of the OPC glaze in comparison with the \nuntreated OPC surface of concrete was conducted to determine such properties as pull-off (bond) \nstrength, rupture strength and wear resistance. Additionally, chemical tests were carried out to \nexamine the corrosion resistance of the laser glazed and untreated OPC with regard to acid (nitric \nacid) alkali (sodium hydroxide) and common industrial detergent. Life assessment testing of the laser \nglazed and untreated OPC was also carried out. \n3. Laser glazing operating parameters \nThe OPC surface of the concrete was seen to glaze readily when exposed to a wide range of HPDL \npower densities and traverse speeds. However, to accurately asses the propensity of the OPC surface \nof the concrete to laser glaze, the relationship between the power density and the interaction time was \nstudied. The results of this investigation are given in Fig. 2. \n It is evident from Fig. 2 that a power density minimum of around 1.25 kW\/cm2 exists, below which \nglazing will not occur, regardless of the interaction time; whilst the minimum interaction time, below \nwhich a significant increase in power is required to produce glazing, is around 0.3 seconds. \nFig. 3 schematically illustrates the concrete laser glazing operating window in terms of traverse speed \nand power density. Within the optimum operating conditions good quality glazes displaying few \nporosities and microcracks could be produced. Furthermore, from Fig. 3 it is possible to ascertain the \nmaximum coverage rate that it may be possible to achieve using the HPDL. This was calculated as \nbeing 1.94 m2\/h for a rectangular beam of 6mm x\n \n30mm with a laser power of 2.5 kW and a traverse \nspeed of 720 mm\/min. \n4.  Morphological characteristics of the laser glaze \n4.1 Glaze formation mechanisms \nThe chemistry of the OPC surface of concrete and the hydration of its various constituents is \nextremely complex, and as such is not yet fully resolved [12]. Nevertheless, it is known that the \nconstituents of OPC are minerals which exist as multi-component solid solution chemical \ncompounds. Of particular importance with regards this study, OPC contains in relatively large \nproportions: SiO2 (21wt%), Al2O3 (5wt%) and Fe2O3 (3wt%), which are basic glass network formers \nand modifiers. Consequently the intense local heating brought about by the incident HPDL beam \nresults in the melting of these compounds at around 12830C, thereby causing the materials to lose the \nretained water and form an amorphous glassy material consisting of various calcium-silicate-alumina \ncompounds [4]. Indeed, the amorphous nature of the HPDL generated glazes was verified by an XRD \nanalysis.  \nAs was mentioned earlier, HPDL interaction with the OPC surface occasioned a dramatic colour \nchange; changing from grey to green. Such a change can be ascribed to the resultant phase transitions, \nand also the presence in small concentrations of metal transition ions in various oxidation states \nwithin the OPC composition, in particular, ferric ions in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ oxidation state. Fe3+ and \nFe2+ ions are known to give rise to green and blue colours respectively when subjected to intense \nheating [13, 14]. However, if both phases are present within the composition, then the colour is \ndetermined by the Fe3+\/Fe2+ ion ratio, resulting in dark blue or black colours [13, 14]. Since the \n surface produced after HPDL treatment was green, then it is reasonable to assume that both phases \nwere not present within the OPC. \n4.2 Cracking and porosity formation \nAs Fig. 4 shows, cracking of the HPDL induced glaze occurred. The formation of cracks can be \nattributed mainly to thermal stresses generated during laser irradiation. This is due to the fact that \nOPC has low thermal conductivity, and, as such, during laser heating a large thermal gradient \nbetween the melt zone and the substrate exists which results in the generation of thermal stresses. \nAdditionally, despite the fact that the laser surface treatment process is effectively localised in nature, \nthe fact remains that a certain amount of the heat generated will be conducted to sections of the OPC \nwhere the surface is already glazed. This, combined with existence of a relatively cold OPC substrate \nmeans that thermal stresses will be generated. During the heating phase the stresses will be \ncompressive and relieved by plastic deformation, thus precluding crack formation. At high \ntemperatures (T\u2265Tm) the stresses can also be relieved [15-17]. However, during cooling when the \ntemperature falls below Tm, then stresses will accumulate. If the fracture strength of the material is \nexceeded, then cracking within the melted layer will occur. The thermal stress \u03c3, induced by a \nthermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation:  \n  \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (1) \nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u2206T is the temperature change, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal  expansion \nand \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. More succinctly, \u2206T is the difference between the critical temperature \n(below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and ambient temperature. For OPC            this is the \ndifference between the melting point, 12830C and ambient temperature 200C. So, if it is assumed that \nthe glass formed on the surface of the OPC is similar to soda-lime-silica glass because the \ncompositions of the two materials are similar, then by using the following values for pyrex: E=6.42 x \n104 MN m-2, \u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1, \u2206T=12630C and \u03bd=0.176, when the OPC surface of the concrete was \nirradiated by the HPDL beam the thermal stress produced in the resulting glass according to Eq. (1) \nwas around 305 MN m-2. Since this is well in excess of the fracture strength of the glass, 120 MN m-2 \n[18], cracking will occur, and can only be avoided by severe distortion or through the reduction of \u2206T \nby pre-heating.  \n From Fig. 4 it can be seen that porosities were a common feature of the HPDL induced glaze, varying \nin size from microscopic pits to large craters depending upon both the laser operating parameters and \nthe actual laser employed. For all instances of porosity formation the mechanism behind their \ndevelopment is the consequence of gas escaping from within the melt and disrupting the surface [19]. \nWith regard to the OPC glaze, the gas is likely to be CO2 [10]. If the laser energy density incident on \nthe OPC is too low, then the generated CO2 can not escape from the molten OPC surface easily \nbecause of the high viscosity of the melt. As such, when the CO2 gas eventually does penetrate the \nmelt surface, the resultant porosity is not filled by the flow of the melt; since the insufficient energy \ndensity is unable to maintain a high enough temperature for an adequate length of time and thus \ndecrease the overall viscosity of the melt [20]. In this case the porosities formed are typically small \nand shallow, being regular in both periodicity and intensity . On the other hand, if the laser energy \ndensity incident on the OPC surface of the concrete is too high, then boiling of the surface may \nhappen. At the same time an increase in CO2 gas formation may occur within the melt. These \nindividual pockets of CO2 gas formation may combine and rise to surface of the melt. Once the \nenergy density decreases (as the laser traverses away), then the additional CO2 gas will attempt to \nescape from the molten surface. However, the solidifying melt will prevent this, causing bubbles to \nform. The excessive CO2 gas pressure will firstly cause the bubbles to expand and ultimately rupture \nthe walls of the bubbles creating a sharp \u2018knife edge\u2019 porosity [3, 10]. These types of porosity are \nusually large, deep and randomly spaced. \n5. Mechanical, chemical and physical properties \nCurrent British and international standards in relation to concrete are concerned only with water \nabsorption and compressive strength. Consequently, it was not possible to test the HPDL generated \nglazes according to, and strictly adhering to, established tests. As such, wherever possible tests based \non current standards were developed to investigate specific aspects of particular relevance to the \nHPDL generated glazes, namely: pull-off strength, surface roughness, rupture strength, wear \nresistance and corrosion resistance.  \n \n5.1 Pull-off strength \n To assess the strength of the bond between the HPDL generated surface glaze on the OPC and the \nconcrete substrate itself, pull-off tests were conducted. For the tests the concrete was prepared as \nrelatively small area samples (25mm x 25mm). High tensile aluminium test dollies were then attached \nonto the glazed surface and to the axially opposite concrete substrate surface using Araldite epoxy \nand left to cure for 24 hours. In order to ensure axial accuracy (essential for true results), the test \ndollies were set in position using identical V-blocks. The samples were placed into an Instron 4507 \ntensile\/compressive test rig by mounting the test dollies into the jaws of the rig. A tensile force was \nthen applied until failure with the energy being simultaneously recorded. \nThe results obtained varied markedly with changes in the laser operating parameters, as Fig. 5 shows. \nA post-test analysis of the samples showed that the material failed approximately below the laser \ntreated surface in the heat affected zone (HAZ). Within the optimum laser operating parameters the \naverage bond strength of the glaze was recorded as 24 MPa. This compares with 63 MPa for the \nuntreated OPC surface of concrete.  \n5.2 Rupture strength \nTests were conducted to determine the rupture strength of the OPC glaze. Test samples were prepared \nas described above. The samples were placed onto the sample stage of the Instron 4507 \ntensile\/compressive test rig and then subjected to a compressive rupture force until the OPC glaze \nfailed (cracked), with the energy being simultaneously recorded. The rupture force was applied by \nmeans of a high tensile steel indentor with a 1mm radius point. The results of the tests revealed that \nthe average rupture strength of the OPC glaze was only 0.8 J, whilst the rupture strength of the \nuntreated OPC surface was some 4.3 J.  \n5.3 Wear life characteristics \nThe wear resistance of a material in general is determined primarily by the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with the hardness of other materials with which it comes into contact [21]. However, \nwear resistance does not always increase with hardness [22]. Tests were therefore conducted to \ndetermine the exact difference in wear resistance characteristics of the OPC glaze and the untreated \nOPC surface. For experimental purposes the OPC was cut into smaller pieces (25 x 25mm). Half of \nthe samples were then laser treated. All the samples were then weighed and subjected to a friction \nforce for 8 hours, being removed from the machine and weighed at two hourly intervals. \n Fig. 6 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the OPC glaze and the \nuntreated OPC. As one can see, the OPC glaze shows a significant increase in wear resistance over \nthe untreated OPC surface, with the weight loss being 2 times lower after 4 hours, and 3 times lower \nafter 8 hours. \n5.4 Corrosion resistance \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal service \nenvironment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore corrosion resistance tests based upon                 \nBS 6431 [23] were conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and Premier Products MP9 \ndetergent cleaner. The experiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive \nagents in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% on to the surface of the untreated \nand HPDL glazed OPC surface of concrete at hourly intervals for four hours. The samples were then \nexamined optically and mechanically tested in terms of compressive strength and wear. High \nconcentrations of the various corrosive agents were used principally to accelerate the tests. However, \nin practice 60% nitric acid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear \nfuels [24].  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nuntreated OPC surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater severity than \nthe detergent, whilst the HPDL glazed surface displayed no discernible microstructural changes or \nsigns of devitrification due to corrosion.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [25] revealed that exposure of the untreated OPC \nsurface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear resistance of \nthe OPC. Exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the concentrations 40-80% \nresulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 19-37%. In the case of the \ndetergent a discernible loss in compressive strength only occurred with concentrations above 40%. \nHere the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the range 60-80% was \napproximately 17%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the wear resistance or the \ncompressive strength of the HPDL glazed surface. \nFig. 7 shows the variation in wear resistance of the untreated OPC surface when exposed to the \nreagents with an 80% concentration. As one can see, the wear resistance is significantly affected, \nparticularly through interaction with the nitric acid and the sodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss \n was approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed OPC after 4 hours, and approximately 11 \ntimes higher after 8 hours for the nitric acid. In the case of the detergent the weight loss was marginal \nafter both 4 and 8 hours. \n6. Effects of comparatively large laser beam geometry \nAs discussed previously, the use of the 2.5 kW HPDL offered for the first time the possibility glazing \nthe OPC surface of concrete at very high rates. Such an achievement was facilitated primarily by the \npossibility of employing relatively large geometry beams (up to 6 x 40mm). However, as the work of \nLiu et al. [26] revealed, the use of relatively large laser beams is not without attendant problems, not \nleast the generation of melt pools exhibiting deep central sections.  \nExperiments to investigate this disadvantageous occurrence were conducted by forming an aperture \nusing two stainless steel plates, with the spacing between the two being varied to give aperture sizes, \nand thus beam widths (D), of 1-5mm. The laser power was fixed at 2 kW with unmodified beam \ndimensions of 6 x 10mm and traverse speeds ranging from 180-660 mm\/min. Such an arrangement \nconsequently allowed the examination of the effect of the laser beam width on the melt pool \ndimensions at constant laser power density and interaction time.  \nAs is evident from Fig. 8, when the laser power density and traverse speed were fixed, the maximum \nmelt depth was significantly affected by the aperture size. Indeed, if one considers the instance when \nthe laser power was 2 kW and the traverse speed 540 mm\/min, it is clearly evident that the change in \naperture size from 1mm to 5mm resulted in a considerable difference in the maximum melt depth \nfrom 0.3mm to 1.2mm respectively. Such findings are in accord with those of Liu et al. [26], who \nnoted that laser alloying melt depth of Ni on an Al-bronze substrate was affected significantly by \naperture size.  \n7. Discussion \nAs the results of the mechanical and chemical tests show, the OPC glaze out performed the untreated \nOPC surface in almost all the test areas. Moreover, the generally superior mechanical and chemical \nperformance of the OPC glaze over untreated OPC suggests that the life characteristics of the OPC \nglaze may also be superior to those of untreated OPC. This was especially true in the case of \n chemical resistance and water permeability, where the OPC glaze proved to be resistant to both. This \nmarked variation in corrosion resistance and permeability performance is due to the difference in \nstructure of the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC. Whereas the OPC glaze is of an amorphous \nnature, the untreated OPC is comprised of a porous polycrystalline structure, thus the untreated OPC \nis readily attacked by acids whilst the amorphous structure of the OPC glaze ensure an increase in \nacid resistance [27]. However, in any analysis of the wear life of the two materials the in-situ relative \nthickness of the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC surface of the concrete must be considered in \norder to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics, particularly when considering the \nwear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). Consequently the increase \nin wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nOPC laser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (2) \nwhere, Wear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg.cm .cm)\nWear rate (mg.cm .h )\n-3\n-2 -1\n (2a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the OPC glaze over the \nuntreated OPC surface. As Table 1 shows, the OPC glaze gives an increase in actual life over the \nuntreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. However, as one can see, the increase in actual \nlife of the OPC glaze over the untreated OPC surface varies considerably depending upon the \nworking environment. But, notwithstanding this, arguably the most common working environment for \nan OPC surface would involve some contact with at least detergent acids, therefore yielding \nsignificant economic savings since a HPDL glazed OPC surface lasts around 2.5 times longer than \none which is unglazed. \nWhen using identical laser operating parameters, remarkable variations in the depth of melting were \nobserved for different beam widths. The principal factor effecting these differences is believed to be \nthe marked differences in the temperature field distributions induced by the variations in the beam \nwidths. It is generally understood that within a typical laser generated melt pool, the surface \ntemperature is at a maximum in the centre, and decreases at a certain rate moving out from the centre \nto the edges thus establishing a temperature gradient [28, 29]. Clearly, such a condition naturally \ntranslates to a higher temperature in the centre of the melt pool throughout the melt pool section. \nTherefore melting to a greater depth will inherently occur in the centre of the irradiated region. \n Consequently, this occurrence will be compounded as the width of the beam, and hence the generated \nlaser melt pool, increases (assuming the laser parameters are the same). This is due to the fact that the \ntemperature produced by a wide beam is always higher than that produced by a narrow beam as a \nresult of the three-dimensional nature of heat transfer [26, 30]. Accordingly, the melt depth for a \nlarger beam aperture size will always be greater than that for a narrow beam aperture size.  \n8. Conclusions \nThe use of a high power diode laser (HPDL) beam to produce a tough, inexpensive glaze which is \namorphous on ordinary Portland cement (OPC) has been demonstrated successfully. Life assessment \ntesting revealed that the OPC glaze had an increase in wear life of 1.3 to 14.8 times over an untreated \nOPC surface, depending upon the corrosive environment. Mechanical testing of the seals revealed \nthat the average rupture strength of the OPC glaze was only 0.8 J, whilst the rupture strength of               \nthe untreated OPC surface was some 4.3 J. The average bond strength of the glaze was recorded as  \n24 MPa. This compares with 63 MPa for the untreated surface of the OPC. The maximum coverage \nrate that it may be possible to achieve using the HPDL was calculated as being 1.94 m2\/h. Moreover, \nthe attendant problems of severe cracking and spallation which have been reported by many other \nworkers when glazing with a CO2 laser were not observed when using the HPDL. Variations in the \nwidth of the HPDL beam were seen to have a considerable affect on the melt depth. This is believed \nto be because the temperature produced by a wide beam is always higher than that  of a narrow beam \ndue to the three-dimensional nature of heat transfer. \n References \n1.
