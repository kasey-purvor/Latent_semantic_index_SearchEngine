In 1873 the chair of geology at the University of Cambridge fell vacant following the\ndeath of Adam Sedgwick. Nine candidates stepped forward, hoping to fill the post. The\ncorrespondence generated in the ensuing battle illuminates two areas of particular interest.\nFirst, the strategies hidden behind bland lists of successive professors: candidates, peers and\npatrons manoeuvred to influence the outcome of the competition and competitors tried to\nreinforce their geological respectability by collecting testimonials from estimable geological\nacquaintances. Second, the Woodwardian competition inspired some outspoken opinions\nfrom British geologists about the relative worth of the candidates, which offer a fresh\nperspective on the process of professionalization in nineteenth-century science. The applicants\ncame from various backgrounds, including gentlemanly amateurs, clerical geologists,\nSurvey geologists and professors. Judging from the opinions of their peers, it seems that a\nnon-professional or clerical status was rarely of primary concern in defining geological\nrespectability at this time.\nOn 27 January 1873 notice was given that the Woodwardian Professorship of Geology\nat the University of Cambridge was once again vacant after more than half a century.\nProfessor Adam Sedgwick (1785\u20131873), the previous incumbent, had died aged eighty-\nseven, and the election of his successor was to take place in the Senate House on 20\nFebruary at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon.1 Various geologists declared themselves as\ncandidates for the vacant chair. They had twenty-five days in which to convince the\nelectors of their suitability for the post.\nSome revealing confidences were stimulated by this brief episode in the history of\ngeology. This paper, which is based on some surviving correspondence, explores the\nconflict on two different scales. On one level, the letters generated over the course of the\ncompetition permit fine-grained analysis of the attempts made by the candidates to\nadvertise themselves as suitable successors to Sedgwick. On a broader scale, this\npaper positions the Woodwardian competition within the wider context of late\n* Department of Archaeology, University of Durham, DH1 3LE, UK.

The nine candidates came from a variety of\nbackgrounds and exhibited a range of geological expertise. We see how the outcome of\nthe competition was influenced by their efforts to muster support from prominent\nindividuals, the tactics of canvassing within Cambridge colleges and the private\nopinions of their peers.\nThe 1873 competition for the Woodwardian Professorship provides an opportunity\nto add to the relatively small body of work on the institutional structures and percep-\ntions of geology in the late Victorian period. This was a significant time in the history of\nthe discipline when the well-known gentlemanly geologists of the previous generation\nwere being replaced by new faces with different expectations. Roy Porter\u2019s 1982 article\n\u2018The Natural Sciences Tripos and the \u2018\u2018Cambridge school of geology\u2019\u2019, 1850\u20131914\u2019\nsupplies a lucid account of these changes over more than half a century and also\ndescribes the influence of the \u2018Cambridge school of geology\u2019 upon the practice and\norientation of British geology from the 1870s onwards.2 The Woodwardian compe-\ntition might seem a minor event, but these short episodes of dynamic social interaction\ncan be extremely revealing, as Martin Rudwick has demonstrated in far greater detail\nthan attempted here in The Great Devonian Controversy.3 The battle for the\nCambridge chair is similarly fortunate in the survival of letters, now scattered between\na number of archives. A sizeable number of these have only recently been deposited\nin Cambridge University Library. They offer a snapshot of late nineteenth-century\nBritish geology at a stressful period, when positions in the geological hierarchy were\nreassessed, influential connections were forged and opinions were expressed in more\nexplicit terms than usual.\nThe correspondence generated over the twenty-five days of the Woodwardian com-\npetition covers a spectrum of topics. Some letters presented general opinions about the\nrelative merits of the candidates and the likely outcome of the competition; others\nconfronted the immediacies of strategies and canvassing. This paper begins by outlining\nthe history of the Woodwardian Chair and opportunities for geological employment at\nthe time of the competition. After a brief introduction to the candidates, the discussion\nis divided into four sections. The first examines the background of three of the candi-\ndates on the Geological Survey and asks why Survey officers might be tempted to leave.\nThe second section observes the emergence of the candidates and their hunt for\ntestimonials. The University of Cambridge and its colleges provide a focus for the\ncanvassing activities of the third section. The Cambridge colleges played a strong\npolitical role in the affair. They were more powerful in the nineteenth century than\ntoday and these small warring kingdoms often had scant regard for overarching\nuniversity policy. The fourth section returns to the Geological Survey and their opinions\n2 R.

The paper concludes by assessing the\nresults of the competition in the light of these influences and its place within the wider\nsphere of nineteenth-century geology in Britain.\nThe Woodwardian Lectureship in context, c. 1873\nDr John Woodward (1665\u20131728), \u2018Doctor of Physic and Professor of the same in\nGresham College in London\u2019, made provision in his will, dated 1 October 1727, for\nland to be purchased by his executors \u2018of the yearly value of One hundred and Fifty\nPounds\u2019. This was to be used by the University of Cambridge, who would \u2018advise and\ndirect the summ [sic] of One hundred Pounds thereout to be paid yearly and every year\nto a Lecturer \u2019. The Lecturer was to give four lectures each year on a branch of natural\nscience and to look after John Woodward\u2019s fossil collection and catalogues.4\nOn Thursday 21 May 1818 Adam Sedgwick succeeded Professor John Hailstone as\nWoodwardian Lecturer. John Woodward\u2019s \u2018four valuable Cabinets of Fossils \u2019 came\nunder his care and he began to deliver regular courses of lectures.5 Sedgwick ensured\nthat this position could no longer be regarded as a sinecure and the Woodwardian\nposition became a highly respected chair of geology.6 Sedgwick imbued generations of\nCambridge undergraduates with a love of geology. Earlier listeners attended largely out\nof interest, for the Natural Sciences Tripos was only set up halfway through his term of\noffice.7 The only other university position held in comparable regard during the early\nyears of Sedgwick\u2019s reign was the Readership in Geology at Oxford, created in 1819 and\nfirst held by the charismatic William Buckland (1784\u20131856).8\nBy the time of Sedgwick\u2019s death the number of salaried positions and opportunities to\nreceive training in geology had increased.9 Though still a relatively new discipline,\ngeology had become more organized as a profession and a recognizable career structure\nwas starting to emerge. There was a growing awareness of the potential value of\ngeology to the industrial and economic health of Great Britain, although the contribu-\ntions of practical professionals (miners, mineral surveyors and civil engineers) were\noften marginalized by their gentlemanly peers.10 Opportunities for young men to gain\n4 CUL (CUR, 39.17.1, 1.1).\n5 CUL (CUR, 39.17.1, 42).\n6 Duke of Argyll, Obituary of Sedgwick,Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London (1873), 29,\npp. xxx\u2013xxxix; H.

The\nSurvey, discussed in greater detail below, had expanded enormously since its formation\nin 1835. Geology was also gaining respectability as a taught subject within academic\ninstitutions.11\nThe Cambridge and Oxford chairs in geology were soon joined by a number of\nothers. King\u2019s College London was founded in 1828 and opened in 1832, boasting\nCharles Lyell (1797\u20131875) as its first Professor of Geology. Meanwhile, John Phillips\n(1800\u201374) was offering the first systematic series of geological lectures at the rival\nUniversity of London.12 Phillips had gained his early training in field geology whilst\nassisting his uncle, William Smith, in the practical work of a canal engineer and mineral\nsurveyor. Before moving into the academic sphere, he had also been encouraged by the\nRev. Benjamin Richardson, a clerical geologist with a large private library \u2013 a reminder\nof the variety of approaches to geology at this time. Phillips moved across to King\u2019s\nwhen Lyell retired after only two courses of lectures.13 The University of London gained\nits own chair of geology in 1841, by which time it was known as University College.\nThomas Webster (1773\u20131844) won the first competition for this chair, assisted by his\nlecturing experience and the weighty testimonials of William Buckland and Leonard\nHorner.14 Andrew Crombie Ramsay (1814\u201391) occupied the University College chair a\nlittle later, from 1848 until 1851. He left to become Professor of Geology at the newly\nopened Royal School of Mines, which had been established as part of the Geological\nSurvey.15 Owen\u2019s College, in Manchester, opened in the same year. In 1871 the\nMurchison Chair of Geology andMineralogy at the University of Edinburgh was added\nto a growing list of university positions, with Archibald Geikie (1835\u20131924), Survey\nDirector for Scotland, as the first occupant. In addition to this catalogue of geological\nchairs, scientists were hoping to benefit from recent efforts by a Liberal government to\nreform the educational system following the appointment of the Devonshire\nCommission in 1870.16\nMention must also be made of the non-salaried geologists who comprised another\nimportant and valued part of the geological community.

Torrens describes a less direct connection between the rise of geology and the Industrial Revolution, and\na more antagonistic relationship between practical and academic or gentlemanly geologists.\n11 On the links between academic and industrial geology see G.

Morris Berman has\ncautioned against drawing a simplistic professional\/amateur dichotomy in British\nscience at this period.17 The connections and overlaps between the professional, the\namateur and the gentleman were elaborate. A \u2018professional \u2019 might be defined by\ntraining or by employment (usually academic or institutional rather than practical), but\nthe social or financial position of the same individual might also give them \u2018gentle-\nmanly\u2019 status. These boundaries were still hazy. On the one hand, Frank Turner has\nobserved that with the move towards academic and institutional professionalization by\nyoung lay scientists such as Huxley, clerical scientists began to be marginalized by the\nscientific community from the 1840s onwards and their opinions, biased by theological\nconcerns, were taken less seriously. Ruth Barton, on the other hand, has posited\na less antagonistic relationship between professionalizers and gentlemanly non-\nprofessionals.18 At the time of the Woodwardian competition, few geologists seemed to\nconsider clerical or non-professional status relevant to the geological ability of the\ncandidates. Geology had not lost its reputation as a gentlemanly pursuit amongst\npaid as well as unpaid geologists and patronage could still ease the path to geological\nemployment.\nThe candidates\nNine geologists declared themselves competitors for the Woodwardian Chair. Not all\nwould stay in the field to the end of the competition, and ultimately only four would\nreceive any votes from the electors. In January 1873 they might have been described as\nfollows:\nThomas McKenny Hughes (1832\u20131917) of the Geological Survey, currently\nsurveying tracts of land in north-west England. Hughes had taken his under-\ngraduate degree in the 1850s at Trinity College, Cambridge (Sedgwick\u2019s old\ncollege). During this time he had become enthused by Sedgwick\u2019s geological\nlectures.19 His geological interests ranged from Palaeozoic stratigraphy to\nPleistocene drift.\nThe Rev. Thomas George Bonney (1833\u20131923), a popular Fellow and Tutor of\nSt John\u2019s College, Cambridge. Like Trinity, this was a large and influential college,\nand Bonney had lectured on geology at John\u2019s for the past four years. A contem-\nporary of Hughes as an undergraduate at John\u2019s, Bonney had also attended\nSedgwick\u2019s lectures, though infrequently, for in those days \u2018 there was no money\n17 M.

Green had spent his\nundergraduate years at Gonville and Caius College, where, like Bonney, he had\nsubsequently occupied a teaching Fellowship in geology (1856\u201360). Such positions\nhad emerged from the restructuring of the new Natural Sciences Tripos.21\nWilliam Boyd Dawkins (1837\u20131929), previously of the Survey (1861\u20139), currently\nDirector of the Museum and Lecturer in Geology at Owen\u2019s College (later\nManchester University). Dawkins came under the influence of John Phillips at\nOxford, graduating in 1860.22 His work on Pleistocene mammalia had gained him\nFellowship of the Royal Society in 1867.23 By the time of the competition,\nDawkins was also a consultant geologist and served on the Council of the\nGeological Society.24\nThe Rev. Osmond Fisher (1817\u20131914), formerly Fellow and Tutor of Jesus\nCollege, Cambridge. Fisher held a nearby college living and worked on\nmathematical aspects of geology. He was another who had listened to Sedgwick\u2019s\nlectures as a Cambridge undergraduate and now worked on theories of the\nstructure of the Earth\u2019s crust, rock folding and the development of mountain\nranges.25 Fisher also had an interest in the Pleistocene drift.\nJohnMorris (1810\u201386), Professor of Geology at University College London for the\npast eighteen years. Morris had assisted Sedgwick as Deputy Woodwardian\nProfessor for the past two years.

King\u2019s interests were\nbroad: he was an authority on Permian palaeontology and worked on eozoa, and\nthe Queen\u2019s College had recently awarded him their first honorary D.Sc.31\nThe candidates display some of the wide range of backgrounds which nurtured\ngeologists in the late nineteenth century: universities, museums, the Survey and the\nchurch. They brought with them equally varied research interests. Some, like Bonney,\nwere well known in Cambridge, where most of those who would vote for the new\nprofessor resided. Others would have to work much harder to become familiar to the\nelectors. All would be judged on their geological experience and lecturing abilities, but\npersonal reputation, canvassing tactics and the respectability of their supporters would\nalso influence the outcome of the competition. It is interesting to see that many of those\nwho now desired the Woodwardian Chair had originally been set on their geological\npaths by Sedgwick.\nBefore following the candidates into the field, we first consider the Geological Survey,\nthe largest employer of geologists in Britain at this period.

(2), 196.\nThe competition for the Woodwardian Chair of Geology, 1873 443\nconnections: T. McKenny Hughes and A. H. Green were Survey officers at the time\nof the competition; both had started as assistant geologists in 1861. William Boyd\nDawkins, who was no longer in Survey employ, had joined the staff in 1862 at the\nsame lowly rank.34 By the early 1870s there were a number of reasons that\nmight have led Survey staff to consider leaving. Loyalty to the Survey and\ncamaraderie amongst officers engaged in the exhausting but rewarding labours of\nfieldwork were tempered by grievances about pay and promotion and other restrictions\nto freedom.\nThere had been a tremendous expansion and reorganization of Survey staff in 1867\nwhen Sir Roderick Murchison was Director General of the Geological Survey. Both\nHughes and Green were promoted to the rank of senior geologist in the aftermath.35\nAt that time there was still a general expectation that assistant geologists would receive\nadvancement after six years, depending on vacancies and the quality of their work.36\nHowever, the rate of promotion slowed considerably after the late 1860s, largely\nbecause of this staff increase, so Hughes and Green were amongst the last to have such\nexpectations confirmed.37\nThe restructuring of 1867 also highlighted the autocratic tendencies of certain senior\nSurvey staff. Henry Bristow (1817\u201389), one of the new \u2018district surveyors\u2019, confided to\nArchibald Geikie, Director of Scotland, that directors were disinclined to depute any of\ntheir power to district surveyors, \u2018as if a Regiment could consist only of the com-\nmanding officer & rank & file\u2019.38 Under Murchison\u2019s rule, some junior officers thought\nthat their director general spent too much time maintaining his social position. Green\ncomplained to Hughes in 1868 that Murchison was \u2018wholly taken up with African\nexplorers and lions who will flatter his vanity and make him conspicuous in the\nfashionable world: but for a lot of vexatious interference now and then we should not\nknow of his existence\u2019.39 There were also problems of pay. In 1872 Green grumbled that\nSurvey officers received less than other branches of the Civil Service, such as the\nTreasury and Foreign Office.40\nOne final grievance concerned publication restrictions. These had caused one of the\nWoodwardian candidates particular irritation in the past. The information collected by\nSurvey officers belonged to the government and was intended to appear in the official\nmaps and memoirs of the Geological Survey. The rights of officers to read papers on\nthese matters to learned societies had aroused occasional rumbles of debate over the\n34 Minute relating to the appointment of William Boyd Dawkins to the Geological Survey, 19 May 1862,\nBritish Geological Survey Library Archives (hereafter BGS) (GSM1\/8, 211).\n35 Official submission of the new scheme of Survey promotion by Roderick Murchison, 26 March 1867,\nBGS (GSM1\/8, 461).\n36 Official correspondence by Roderick Murchison relating to promotions within the Survey, 15 March\n1867, BGS (GSM1\/8, 458).\n37 See also J.

He fired off a memorandum, insisting that any unofficial\npublications should first be submitted to their director for authorization and should\ninclude appropriate acknowledgement of the Survey.43 David Oldroyd has observed\nthat Murchison\u2019s opposition to this paper was heightened by Hughes\u2019s evident\nfavour for Sedgwick\u2019s side of the Cambrian\u2013Silurian debate over Murchison\u2019s\ninterpretation. He has also suggested that Hughes became more tardy in his\nSurvey duties after this rift.44 A. C. Ramsay, met above as Professor of the School of\nMines, was Director of the Geological Survey of England and Wales at the time and\neventually persuaded Murchison to let Hughes read the offending paper to the\nGeological Society. He urged Hughes to seize \u2018the occasion of facilitating the reading\nof good papers (more or less founded on Survey work) by Survey men on other\noccasions\u2019.45\nIn view of all these problems, it is not surprising that Survey officers were alert for\nmore attractive prospects. A year before the competition, Green had noted that \u2018many\nmen look upon the Survey now only as a step to something better, Dawkins for\ninstance\u2019. He continued, \u2018They come for their own convenience to get a practical\nknowledge of geology and a position, but with a fair determination from the first not to\nstop, and, just when they get to be really valuable, they leave, and a new man has to be\ntrained. \u201946 Dawkins had left in 1869 to take up the position of Curator of the Owen\u2019s\nCollege Museum in Manchester.47 By 1872 Dawkins was also Lecturer in Geology at\nOwen\u2019s College and Green himself was speculating \u2018whether I shall not try to get off\nsoon\u2019.48 Green had held the Lectureship in Geology at the School of Military\nEngineering at Chatham since 1868, perhaps with a view to building up lecturing\n41 Andrew Ramsay to W.

The post went to John Morris of\nUniversity College London, who was to be a rival candidate for the Woodwardian\nChair.50\nIn previous years A. C. Ramsay and Archibald Geikie had managed to combine\ntheir Survey employment with their university chairs.51 This was now becoming more\ndifficult. In Green\u2019s case at Chatham, Murchison had stipulated \u2018that the time occupied\nin these new duties should be taken out of his annual vacation as one of the\nGovernment Geological Surveyors\u2019.52 It is also possible that Hughes, like Green, might\nhave considered applying for the deputy-Woodwardian Professorship, but for the\nconflict with Survey work. A letter from Sedgwick\u2019s niece, Margaret Isabella, hints at\nthis : \u2018 I do wish Mr Hughes had been appointed my Uncle\u2019s deputy for the Lectures if it\nwould not have interfered with his present work, & if he would have taken it. \u201953 The\nstrategy employed by Dawkins \u2013 to leave once the requisite training to secure a position\nelsewhere had been acquired \u2013 was not uncommon.\nSo the Survey seems to have functioned partly, though perhaps not always willingly,\nas a training ground for university lecturers and museum curators. Although the\natmosphere amongst the officers seemed to have lost none of the hearty bonhomie of\nearlier years, there were also cogent reasons to review future prospects and the\nWoodwardian Chair offered an attractive, secure and prestigious position. However,\nthere were great differences between the respectable confines of a university lecture hall\nand the exuberant outdoor life of the field geologist.54 It was only in retrospect that\nsuccessful ex-Survey applicants became fully aware of the drawbacks to university\nemploy in the late nineteenth century, where restrictions to research might have shed a\nrosier light on their years in the Survey.\nThis is not the last we shall hear of the Survey in connection with the Woodwardian\ncompetition. Survey staff held strong opinions about the qualities of a competent\ngeologist, many occupied powerful social positions in the wider scientific world and\nthey were not slow to share their views with those who might influence the votes of\nthe Cambridge electors. But first we return to the end of January 1873 to see the scurry\nof applicants for the newly vacant chair of geology at Cambridge University and\nobserve the strategies, support networks and perceptions which emerged over the next\ntwenty-five days.\n49 Official letter from Col.

The news\nspread rapidly. A telegraph from Cambridge enabled the Pall Mall Gazette, the popular\npaper and review, to add this information to the evening news that day.55 An official\nannouncement of the vacancy was printed the following day and obituaries of Sedgwick\nappeared soon after in the Saturday Review and the Athenaeum.56 Members of the\nuniversity were also quick to warn possible successors that the field was open, and to\nurge an early start in the race.\nThe Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Edward Perowne (1826\u20131906),\nfor example, learnt of Sedgwick\u2019s death in a council meeting. He immediately scribbled\na note to his friend Joshua Hughes, Bishop of St Asaph and father of Thomas McKenny\nHughes: \u2018 I hasten to inform you, in case your son wishes to be a Candidate, he should\nat once confer with his College. In these cases it is most important to be early in\nthe field\u2019.57 So swift was the response upon Sedgwick\u2019s death that Henry Bristow,\nnow Senior Director of the Geological Survey, wrote to his friend (and one of the\ncandidates), Osmond Fisher:\nI do not know what is the usual way of proceeding in such cases; but it seems to me to\nsavour of indecent haste & to show a want of proper feeling to take active measures to fill up\na vacancy so soon after death \u2013 before the dead man has been carried to the grave: but\nI suppose it only amounts to a practical carrying out of the cry \u2018The King is dead! Long live the\nKing\u2019.58\nAlthough an early start was considered advantageous, this placed Hughes, as a close\npersonal friend of the deceased professor, in an awkward position. On 30 January one\nof Sedgwick\u2019s nieces, Margaret Isabella Sedgwick, wrote to reassure Hughes on this\npoint and to warn him that Bonney and Fisher were already canvassing: \u2018 I know how\nkind you are in not moving just now; but I shd. like you to know that we hope you will\nnot delay any steps you may like to take because of our feelings, as I need not tell you\nhow rejoiced our family wd. be if you succeeded him \u2019.59 But though he began gathering\ntestimonials, Hughes still declined to start canvassing until after the funeral.60 Sedgwick\nwas buried on 1 February. His pall bearers included two future candidates (as yet\nunannounced) \u2013 Hughes and Morris \u2013 and one man who would emerge as a supporter\nof Hughes\u2019s candidature, the Rev. Henry Richards Luard (1825\u201391), Registrary of\nthe University of Cambridge (keeper of the University records), medieval historian and\none-time Fellow of Trinity College.61\n55 Anon., \u2018Evening news\u2019, Pall Mall Gazette, 27 January 1873, 8.\n56 Anon., \u2018Cambridge\u2019, Pall Mall Gazette, 28 January 1873, 7; Anon., Obituary of Adam Sedgwick,\nSaturday Review (1873), 35 (901), 140\u20131; Anon., Obituary of Adam Sedgwick, Athenaeum (1873), 2362,\n150\u20131.\n57 Edward Perowne to Joshua Hughes, 27 January 1873, CUL (Add MS 9557\/2 G\/3).

Luard wrote to another influential figure, Dr Clement Mansfield Ingleby\n(1823\u201386), metaphysicist and Shakespeare critic, informing him that Thomas McKenny\nHughes was not yet in the field. Ingleby passed this letter on to William Whitaker\n(1836\u20131925), the Survey geologist, who scribbled, next to the critical passage, \u2018What\nthe Devil does this mean Thomas? Why don\u2019t you show yourself like a man?\u201963 On 7\nFebruary Hughes learned that Brodie was a candidate. The Athenaeum reported the\nnext day that Bonney, Dawkins and Fisher had been joined by Martin Duncan, Green\nand Hughes.64 Morris had entered the race by 11 February and King by 15 February.65\nWith all the candidates now in the field, it is time to introduce the electors and those\nwho might influence their opinion.\nThe electors and eminent authorities\nOnly electors could vote in the competition, so they were the ultimate target for anyone\nwho wanted to influence its outcome. Candidates could discover electors\u2019 names by\nreading the Electoral Roll of the University, and most were resident in Cambridge:\n\u2018Heads of Houses, Professors, University Examiners, and resident members of the\nSenate\u2019.66 Few would have known anything of geology. Their opinions would have\nbeen heavily influenced by university and college politics ; however, a geologically\nrespectable candidate was also required to retain the good name of the chair. The public\neye might well have been focused closely on Cambridge at this time, for a Royal\nCommission had been appointed the previous year to investigate college finances at\nOxford and Cambridge. This had stimulated arguments for reform \u2013 particularly of the\nsciences \u2013 amongst Cambridge and Oxford dons.67\nThe candidates would have known few of the electors personally. They were gener-\nally approached through intermediaries \u2013 eminent geologists or individuals of high\nstanding in the university who might convince the electors of the quality and suitability\nof their prote\u00b4ge\u00b4s. These authorities might advocate the cause of a favoured candidate\nthrough conversation or letter, but the standard route was the testimonial \u2013 an official\nsupporting letter written to a candidate and vouching for their experience and overall\nfitness for the post. Candidates raced to secure these statements of approbation.

Both aspects were important. Bonney, Fisher and\nMorris had the advantage of being relatively well known in Cambridge at the start of\nthe competition. When Fisher requested a testimonial from George Downing Liveing,\nProfessor of Chemistry and Fellow of St John\u2019s, Liveing advised, \u2018Of course I am willing\nto write you a testimonial if you wish it, but I really think it will not help you. It is the\nopinion of outsiders which you want to make known to the electors in that way.\u201968 The\nmost popular outsiders to be targeted, aside from previous employers, were respected\nelderly geologists who occupied socially powerful positions amongst their scientific\npeers. They included Henry Woodward, Joseph Prestwich, John Phillips, Charles Lyell\nand A. C. Ramsay.\nLetters from candidates to employers, authorities and friends, both inside and outside\nCambridge, often presented their recipients with a dilemma. The candidates did not all\nemerge at once, so those who received early requests for testimonials had to find out\nwho else might be stepping forward before they could resolve where their allegiances\nlay. Only then could they decide whether to accede or decline, and how effusive to make\ntheir response. Although the content of testimonials was rather similar (a statement that\nthe candidate was a competent geologist and a good lecturer), the decisions that were\ntaken by beleaguered authorities on whether to supply or withhold their official support\ncan be very informative.\nHenry Woodward (1832\u20131921), editor of the Geological Magazine (which had\npublished Hughes\u2019s controversial Survey paper in 1867), was placed in an awkward\nposition when he received a letter from Fisher at the end of January. He wrote to\nHughes, asking whether he was also going to apply and, if so, whether he wanted a\ntestimonial :\nmy reason for asking this imperatively is that Fisher writes for a testimonial & I would much\nprefer not having to hurt his feelings by telling him \u2018I feared he was not strong enough for the\nplace\u2019 ; it would be less brutal on my part to say I had already spoken in your favour, which is\nthe fact.69\n68 George Liveing to Osmond Fisher, 2 February 1873, CUL (AddMS 7652\/V R\/16). The need to secure the\ngood opinion of outsiders was also an important aspect of the 1888 competition for the Oxford chair of\ngeology. Joseph Lucas, ex-Survey officer and hydrogeologist, sought prominent politicians, professors and\nsociety figures as well as geologists to support his candidature. The blessing of the previous incumbent, Joseph\nPrestwich, was particularly prized by the candidates. Lucas\u2019s testimonials stressed the value of practical ability\nalongside published works, two aspects which attracted discussion in the Cambridge competition (J. Lucas,\nTestimonials, British Library, London, 1888). Many thanks to Hugh Torrens for passing on this information.\n69 HenryWoodward to ThomasMcKenny Hughes, 29 January 1873, CUL (AddMS 9557\/2 G\/5). Original\nemphasis.\nThe competition for the Woodwardian Chair of Geology, 1873 449\nFisher received a similar rebuff from Professor T. Rupert Jones, Professor of Geology at\nthe Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and recently elected Fellow of the Royal Society,\nwho was waiting to hear more of the intentions of John Morris, another potential\ncandidate.70 Such correspondence helped to clarify the field of combat by stimulating\ngeological authorities to decide upon their allegiances and by forcing potential candi-\ndates to choose whether or not to stand for the chair in the light of the emerging\ncompetition.\nSome authorities, such as Joseph Prestwich (1812\u201396), were free with their testi-\nmonials and supplied these to more than one candidate. Prestwich was a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society, a past President of the Geological Society and an expert on Tertiary and\ndrift deposits. He had retired from his full-time business as a wine merchant the\nprevious year. By the time he received Hughes\u2019s request for a testimonial, Prestwich\nhad already supplied Fisher and Dawkins with the necessary letters. He admitted that\nhe had been partly motivated by friendship, observing that he would have restricted\nhimself further, \u2018 if I thought there were only one fitting candidate & the applications\nwere not from personal friends\u2019.71 Others were more exclusive in their support.\nDawkins, who was early in the field, managed to secure a testimonial from John\nPhillips, Fellow of the Royal Society, past President of the Geological Society and\nProfessor of Geology at Oxford, where Dawkins had taken his undergraduate\ndegree. Phillips later declined, though in gracious terms, to give one to Hughes.72 On the\nother hand Charles Lyell, another Fellow of the Royal Society, past President of\nthe Geological Society and a most eminent geologist, devoted his attentions to\nHughes. When approached by Dawkins and Brodie, he refused to provide either with\na testimonial, although he considered Brodie to be \u2018a good man\u2019.73 We shall return\nlater to the efforts made by Charles Lyell and his wife Mary on behalf of Hughes\u2019s\ncandidature.\nThe senior staff of the Geological Survey comprised another fertile source of\ntestimonials. Requests appeared under a number of guises : some candidates wrote as\nemployees, some were personal friends, others wrote as one respectable geologist to\nanother. When the boundaries between these areas became blurred, Survey staff could\nfind it difficult to reconcile their loyalties. Henry Bristow, Senior Director of the Survey,\nwas a good friend of Fisher and at first determined to support only him.74 However, he\nlater informed Fisher, \u2018 I have given Hughes a handsome Testimonial which I could not\nhonestly avoid doing, as he really is entitled to it both officially & as a long known\nfriend of 12 years standing. \u201975 A.

As might have been expected, he supplied\nboth Survey men, Hughes and Green, with testimonials.76 However, he declined to\nprovide Fisher with one, excusing himself with the statement that \u2018too many testi-\nmonials from the same hand weakens every one of them, and before receiving your note\nI had previously promised testimonials to two of our own people both Cambridge men,\nviz. Mr Hughes and Mr Green\u2019.77 Ramsay and other authorities on the Survey could\nspeak with more assurance about the qualities of candidates with Survey connections\nthan those without. However, the geological expertise gained by Hughes and Green on\nthe Survey might also have been held in higher regard than the kind of geological\nresearch carried out by other candidates, an aspect which will be explored later in the\npaper.\nNetworks of support gradually emerged during these first few uncertain days. In the\nprocess, the veil of everyday dissimulation and diplomacy was occasionally lifted a\nfraction to reveal private opinions about geological competence and friendship. We\nreturn from these broad geological horizons to Cambridge, where the candidates, now\narmed with testimonials, were making themselves known to the electors. Fisher, and\ncertainly Bonney and Morris, were well known here. But for those less familiar to the\nelectors, canvassing amongst the Cambridge colleges was a particularly crucial part of\nthe competition.\nCanvassing in Cambridge: powerful peers and college factions\nHughes and Bonney soon drew ahead of their comrades and became the main com-\npetitors for the chair. Hughes\u2019s supporters marked Bonney, who had long resided in\nCambridge, as a very dangerous rival.78 A few days into the competition, Mary Lyell\nconfessed to Hughes, \u2018 I fear with you that Bonney will succeed, still we must not give up\nhopes. \u201979 On 11 February the Pall Mall Gazette set out the case for each side in this\nprescient announcement:\nIt seems probable that the contest will lie between Mr Bonney, who has the advantage of being\na resident and has been lecturing on geology for the last four years in his own college, and\nMr Hughes, who besides an experience of more than twelve years on the Geological Survey,\nis recommended by the distinctly expressed preference of Professor Sedgwick.80\nBonney had been Lecturer in Geology at St John\u2019s College since 1869 and, as he\nemphasized in his declaration to the electors, students from other colleges also attended\nhis lectures.81 His geological ascent in Cambridge had coincided with Sedgwick\u2019s\ndecline in health, and it has been observed that his efforts kept the traditions of the\nCambridge school of geology alive during this difficult period. However, Bonney had\n76 CUL (CUR, 39.17.2,126, 131).\n77 Andrew Ramsay to Osmond Fisher, 29 January 1873, CUL (Add MS 7652\/V R\/22).\n78 David Forbes to Thomas McKenny Hughes, 31 January 1873, CUL (Add MS 9557\/2 G\/13).\n79 Lyell to Hughes, op. cit.

Finally, he had the support of the Survey, of\nwhich more later. However, as Sedgwick himself had noted less than a year before his\ndeath, one of the most important disadvantages under which Hughes might labour,\nshould he choose to succeed him in the chair, was that he was not in Cambridge very\noften and was therefore not personally known to many of the electors.83 Mary Lyell,\nwho emerged as Hughes\u2019s campaign manager, attempted to address this situation in her\nstrategic canvassing of electors.\nThe Lyells\u2019 campaign for Hughes\nFrom the start of the competition, Hughes had been assailed with advice to secure the\ninfluence of Sir Charles Lyell.84 Lyell has appeared earlier in this paper as a favourite\ntarget for testimonial hunters. His eminently respectable name was considered likely to\nattract the attention of the electors. He had won early renown with his Principles of\nGeology, and his theories had been keenly discussed at the Geological Society in the\npast.85 Though now aged seventy-five, Lyell was still geologizing in Britain and abroad\nand he continued to publish; the fourth edition of his Antiquity of Man would appear\nsoon after the conclusion of the Woodwardian competition.86 Mary Lyell, daughter of\nthe geologist Leonard Horner, often accompanied Lyell on tours and assisted him with\npublications.87 Hughes, a friend of both Charles and Mary Lyell, had joined them on\nsome of their recent trips.88\nThere was little need for concern on the part of Hughes\u2019s advisors. The Lyells had\nevidently favoured Hughes as Sedgwick\u2019s successor for some years before the chair\nbecame vacant andMary Lyell had been ensuring that Sedgwick knew of her husband\u2019s\n82 Woodward, op. cit.

In 1872 she received the following\nintelligence from Sedgwick\u2019s niece, Margaret Isabella:\nI took what I thought a good opportunity to read to him the greater part of the letters which\nyou wrote to me last autumn with Sir Charles\u2019 opinion of Mr Hughes. Uncle was extremely\nglad to hear it. He said how glad he should be to think that he should have such a suc-\ncession \u2013 then he wondered if any of the electors would think of his present deputy Prof.\nMorris \u2013 I do not think now that my uncle will resign this year. I am afraid I cannot be of any\nmore use, can I?89\nOnce the situation became vacant, Mary Lyell contacted all those who might further\nHughes\u2019s interests, spreading the news of Lyell\u2019s support for Hughes amongst the col-\nleges of Cambridge and down any route that might gain the attention of the electors. A\nreply to a letter from Hughes suggests the immensity of her task: \u2018received yours with\nthe Electoral Roll. How few we know. I think I shall put Sir Charles to write to the\nMaster of Sidney, & [?] to the Master of Magdalene\u2019.90 Mary Lyell\u2019s own burden of\nrecipients included the Rev. Charles Kingsley (1819\u201375), the former Professor of\nModern History at Cambridge who turned out to be a supporter of Dawkins, and T. H.\nHuxley.91 She was also keen to win over Henry Sidgwick, Lecturer in Moral Sciences,\nwho had considerable influence in Trinity College.92\nHughes\u2019s name and qualifications must soon have become well known to the elec-\ntors, and this was due in large part to the efforts of the Lyells. However, two other\nimportant Cambridge influences on Hughes\u2019s candidature also feature strongly in the\nWoodwardian correspondence and must be addressed before concluding this section.\nFirst, the reaction in Trinity College, where Adam Sedgwick had spent his life and\nHughes his undergraduate years, and, second, the posthumous support of Sedgwick\nhimself.\nTrinity College, Adam Sedgwick and the unpredictability of electors\nTrinity College was large, powerful and host to a sizeable proportion of electors. The\nother Cambridge college of similar size and standing was St John\u2019s. The long-standing\nrivalry between these two neighbouring colleges was now mirrored in their respective\nsupport for the candidature of Hughes and Bonney. Ingleby, an advocate of Hughes,\nconfided to Luard that Bonney could count on assistance from the electors of St John\u2019s :\n\u2018Bonney will have a strong backing, because he is an agreeable fellow, & very popular\nin his college. \u201993 However, the casting of the large quantity of Trinity votes in favour of\nHughes was not guaranteed; some feared that the Trinity electors might become touchy\nif approached in the wrong way.\n89 Sedgwick to Lyell, op. cit.

I have\nasked him to adopt Hughes as the Trinity Candidate\u2019.95 Ingleby was practised in\nCambridge politics and had recently been attempting to shake up the Moral Sciences\nTripos.96\nAttempts to reach electors through the pages of leading journals, such as the\nAthenaeum, the Academy or Nature, inspired similar concerns. Ingleby asked Luard,\n\u2018How are these ignoramuses of electors to be enlightened. I am disposed to put a\nparagraph in the Athenaeum : but one is so fearful of doing a candidate harm.\u201997 Luard\nreplied, \u2018 it must be carefully done so as not to seem to dictate to the electors. Otherwise\nthey get their backs put up, & it goes against the candidate it supports \u2019.98 A letter from\na Cambridge correspondent did appear in the Pall Mall Gazette on 11 February\n(see above), painting Hughes in rosier colours than Bonney and publicizing Sedgwick\u2019s\nown posthumous support for Hughes.99\nIn the past, Sedgwick had hinted to the Master of Trinity that he would like Hughes\nto succeed him asWoodwardian Professor.100 After his death, Sedgwick\u2019s niece, Mary J.\nSedgwick, wrote to Hughes, \u2018We are all hoping so very very much that you will be\nchosen Professor in our dear Uncle\u2019s place. I wish with all my heart we could be of any\nuse to you but I fear that is impossible. \u2019101 Hughes\u2019s contemporaries were divided about\nhow far the Sedgwick stamp of approval would influence the electors, and this\nsubject was of considerable interest in the Geological Survey offices in London. Liveing\ninformed Fisher,\nI saw Bristow on Friday & he told me that Hughes had some letter from Miss Sedgwick\nexpressing Sedgwick\u2019s favourable opinion of him. I don\u2019t know how much it amounts to.\nI know that Sedgwick had spoken highly of him but I feel sure that he would not say anything\nto prejudice the choice of his successor, nevertheless it may be construed as a wish that he\nshould have the chair.102\n94 William Thompson to Thomas McKenny Hughes, 3 February 1873, CUL (Add MS 9557\/2 G\/24);\nWilliam Thompson to Henry Luard, 3 February 1873, CUL (CUR, 39.17.2, 127).\n95 Clement Ingleby to William Whitaker, written on the reverse of the letter from Luard to Ingleby, op.\ncit.

(68).\n454 Anne O\u2019Connor\nIt was difficult to predict the outcome of the competition, and there was no sure route\nto victory. Bonney was on the spot, but Hughes came armed with powerful advocates.\nThe electors were bombarded with testimonials by the candidates, and their supporters\ntackled them in person, by letter and through intermediaries. In Hughes\u2019s case, some of\nhis supporters infused his claims with geological authority from afar, whilst others\napproached the Cambridge electors on their own ground to publicize his cause. Electors\nmight even read about the relative merits of candidates in the papers. However, before\nreturning to Cambridge on 20 February when the electors finally cast their votes, one\nmore influence on the outcome of the competition must be discussed. This requires a\nfinal visit to the Geological Survey.\nOpinions in the Survey\nThe Geological Survey nurtured strong opinions about the merits of the candidates, and\nsome of these had been offered to the electors in public testimonials. This final section\nlooks at the more candid estimations which were expressed privately and sees how\nSurvey gossip was employed by Cambridge-based supporters in the tactical promotion\nof prote\u00b4ge\u00b4s.\nOpinions about the Woodwardian competition within the Survey tended to focus on\nthe geological competence of the candidates. When Sedgwick won the chair in 1818 he\nwas quite happy to declare, in the gentlemanly atmosphere of the time, that he had no\nknowledge of geology.103 However, previous experience and statements of geological\ncompetence featured prominently in the testimonials of his would-be successors, who\ndemonstrated a range of expertise. Some had been acquired in geological employment,\nothers in spare time whilst employed by the church. There was no strict division\nbetween the two; Bonney\u2019s case demonstrates that even those working in geology were\noften dependent on spare time for their research. Contemporary views about the\ngeological competence of the candidates were informed by disparate institutional,\nintellectual and social backgrounds and were, in consequence, very varied. But a\nhigh proportion of responses from Survey employees were coloured by the ethos of\nfieldwork.\nFieldwork was spoken of with pride on the Survey and was considered an essential\npart of any geological lecture course. Sedgwick himself had been a respected field\ngeologist as well as an inspiring lecturer. Surveying was not just an important part of\ngeological research; it had become a romantic ideal during the nineteenth century,\ndescribed by Roy Porter as a cult, an obsession. Although Survey employees were paid,\ntheir outdoor pursuits were still perceived as respectable, gentlemanly ones, where\nappointment was largely achieved through patronage and employees were gentle-\nmen.104 \u2018Gentlemanly\u2019 status was a matter of public presentation in society as much as\n103 Porter, op. cit. (6), 819; Becher, op. cit. (6), 63. ThomasWebster, who won the University College chair\nin 1841, regarded himself as a professional lecturer, and his lecturing skills had a prominent place alongside\nhis geological work in his testimonials from William Buckland and Leonard Horner. Webster also made the\nmost of support from two professors within the same institution. See Challinor, op. cit. (14), 148\u201350.\n104 Porter, op. cit. (6), 819\u201321, 825\u20138.\nThe competition for the Woodwardian Chair of Geology, 1873 455\nfamily background or financial independence, and drew upon manners, interests, con-\ntacts, culture and subtle social nuances. When Hughes first applied to the Survey for the\npost of assistant geologist he had been helped by Sedgwick before being invited to join\nthe staff by Murchison in 1861.105 Senior Survey staff now offered their patronage to\ncandidates for the Cambridge chair.\nHughes won a splendid testimonial from Ramsay, the director general, who stated\nwith authority, \u2018 I consider you to be a first rate field Geologist. \u2019106 Green was also\nregarded as a good geologist : well liked, well seasoned with field experience. He also\nsecured a testimonial from Ramsay. However, Ramsay evidently favoured Hughes over\nGreen, and Green was also encumbered with some disreputable affair from his past.107\nOf the three candidates with Survey connections, Dawkins was held in the lowest\nregard by his erstwhile colleagues. He had left the institution tarred as a poor geologist.\nThere could be worse things than the withholding of patronage when such a reputation\ntravelled outside the Survey.\nDawkins was well known by the time of the election as a Fellow of the Royal Society\nwho held a good lectureship in geology at Owen\u2019s College, Manchester. However, his\nbad reputation on the Survey damaged his chances in the competition. Searles V. Wood\nJr (1830\u201384) confided to Hughes that when Dawkins had been assigned part of the\neastern counties to survey, he had made selective use of Wood\u2019s own, privately\nproduced, map and had made up much of the rest, adding, \u2018 I was not surprised to find\nthat his work was all put aside at Jermyn Street & fresh Geologists put on to do it all\nover again. \u2019108 Dawkins\u2019s consultancy work in industrial geology, which tended to be\nregarded as a rather shabby sector of geological research, might also have diminished\nhis standing. Dawkins withdrew his candidature on 15 February. By this time, Hughes\nand Bonney were galloping ahead.109\nHow was this information travelling to Cambridge?\nInformation was travelling from geologists to Cambridge electors in private letters\nas well as public testimonials and these could take complicated routes. The\nWhitaker\u2013Ingleby\u2013Luard chain supplied one such line of private communication.\nWilliam Whitaker, Survey geologist, kept Hughes\u2019s supporter, Ingleby, in touch with\nSurvey opinion and seems to have recommended Hughes to Ingleby as the Survey\u2019s\ncandidate of choice.110 Ingleby, in turn, was transmitting this information to Luard,\nanother powerful voice in Cambridge, and he was not averse to sharing negative Survey\ninformation about Hughes\u2019s rivals Dawkins and Bonney.\n105 Thomas McKenny Hughes to Adam Sedgwick, 25 March 1861, CUL (Add MS 7652\/II O\/62);\nWoodward, op. cit.

He\u2019s an\nimpudent brute, & has been known to boast that he shall certainly succeed Sedgwick.\nThat\u2019s W. Boyd Dawkins FRS & I hope & thank there\u2019s no fear of yr. having him.\u2019112\nBonney and the Survey\nBonney\u2019s name was much discussed in the Survey as one of the front runners for the\nchair. Bonney had written to Whitaker on the day of Sedgwick\u2019s death, informing him\nof the sad occasion and adding, \u2018 I shall probably offer myself as a candidate, with what\nsuccess time will shew.\u2019113 News was soon circulating in the Survey that Bonney had the\npromise of over a hundred votes, a rumour that seems to have started with Hughes.114\nWhitaker appears to have drawn some unflattering portraits of Bonney in his com-\nmunications with Ingleby, who in turn confided to Luard that although Bonney could\nbe sure of strong support from his own college, \u2018he is not a field or practical geologist \u2019.\nIngleby added that Bonney \u2018wd be a most unfortunate professor, for he would be\nlaughed at (& his electors, of course,) by all competent geologists. I wish you would\nimpress on your friends at Cambridge, that no man is fit to hold a geological\nprofessorship who has not done the practical work of the survey \u2019.115\nThere are two issues of importance here : the lack of fieldwork, but also the lack of\nsupport in the Survey and amongst fieldworking geologists for the kind of geological\nresearch practised by Bonney. Bonney was publishing very little at this time and his\noutput was perhaps restricted by the demands of his college teaching post.116 However,\nhe was known for a recent interest in petrological research (although he had also\nworked on the Alpine strata). Petrology and mathematical geology were becoming\nmore frequently studied, and reflect a growing specialization in the discipline.117\nAlthough petrology was well regarded in Germany and France, it was not rated highly\nby Survey fieldworkers of the old school (Bonney did, however, manage to gain a\nreference from the Survey palaeontologist Robert Etheridge).118 A few years after the\ncompetition, when Archibald Geikie was engaged with his microscope one evening,\n111 Ingleby to Luard, op. cit.

Bonney did carry out some fieldwork; the map and sections he made at Glen Logan\nin 1879, for example, contributed to the Highlands controversy, but he was not seen as a sound fieldworker.\nSee D. R. Oldroyd, The Highlands Controversy, Chicago, 1990, 180\u20136.\nThe competition for the Woodwardian Chair of Geology, 1873 457\nRamsay remarked impatiently, \u2018 I cannot see of what use these slides can be to a field-\nman. I don\u2019t believe in looking at a mountain with a microscope. \u2019119 Bonney seems to\nhave been aware of Survey disdain for those they perceived as non-fieldworkers. Much\nlater, when President of the Geological Society, he cautioned,\nThe establishment of a Geological Survey as a department of the State is an immense boon to a\ncountry; but there is always some danger lest the systematic method of their work, and a\nnatural, I may say laudable, esprit de corps should lead its members to regard workers\nunconnectedwith themas intruders, and to speakwith somecontempt of \u2018amateurs \u2019. Personally\nI should not admit that a man who has devoted his life to the study and teaching of geology is\nnot as fully entitled to be called a Professional Geologist as one who is an officer of a Survey.120\nFisher also had difficulties in securing testimonials, some of which have already been\ndescribed. He won a reference from his good friend on the Survey, Henry Bristow (who\nmentioned his fieldwork), but his research on mathematical aspects of geology, often\nregarded as a sideline subject, might have exerted a negative influence on other geol-\nogists, and Fisher was not prominent in learned societies.121 However, geological\nexpertise and lecturing abilities dominated discussion; the fact that he, like Bonney, was\na clerical scientist was not mentioned in any of the letters recovered. Ingleby appears to\nidentify the most likely reason for Fisher\u2019s poor running when he confided to Luard that\n\u2018O. Fisher is, beyond question, a good geologist \u2026 but he is an extremely bad lecturer ;\n& is therefore unfit for the chair \u2019.122\nIn this range of Survey opinion Hughes was favoured above the other candidates.\nHughes was a gentleman and a fieldworker, a true son of the Survey. Dawkins was\nregarded as a poor or lazy fieldworker who was currently dabbling in the shabby world\nof industrial geology. Bonney, a petrologist rather than a fieldworker, was emerging as\nHughes\u2019s main rival. All of this information was diligently transmitted to Cambridge.\nAlthough this analysis is based on only a fragment of contemporary opinion, the tone of\nthese letters suggests that the estimations of the Survey, the largest geological employer\nof the time, would be taken seriously by many electors, who would not (as Ingleby\nthreatened) want to be laughed at for making the wrong decision.\nResults\nAt one o\u2019clock in the afternoon on Thursday 20 February 1873, the electors began to\ncast their votes. At half past two the Vice-Chancellor announced the result : Hughes\nobtained 112 votes, Bonney 105, Fisher four and Morris one. Fisher might well have\nreceived a larger proportion of the votes had he not retired within the first half-hour of\nthe voting.123\n119 A.

St John\u2019s and Trinity were very large and therefore held a high\nproportion of the voters. Despite earlier concerns about unpredictable electors, most\ncast their final votes in favour of the college candidate. Hughes received 39 votes from\nTrinity and only one from St John\u2019s; Bonney gained 44 votes from St John\u2019s and 10 from\nTrinity.\nHughes received warm congratulations from Survey colleagues.125 John George\nGoodchild (1844\u20131906), Hughes\u2019s junior colleague in the area of north England which\nthey had been surveying, wrote, \u2018Everyone here seems to be pleased at the news of your\nappointment in to-day\u2019s papers. \u2019 In light of Murchison\u2019s dictate of 1867 it is interesting\nto see that he added, \u2018We are most pleased because you will now be to a great extent\nfree to write what you please without having to keep to instructions or to be careful that\nyou don\u2019t publish any statements that go against the published views of narrow minded\nsuperiors. \u2019126\nConclusions\nConsider the fates of the candidates for the professorship. Thomas McKenny Hughes\nheld the Woodwardian Chair for the next forty-four years. Mary Lyell did not live long\nto see Hughes enjoy his new post, for she died on 24 April 1873. The following year saw\nCharles Lyell priming Hughes for election to the Royal Society and the Athenaeum,\nalthough he did not live to see the fruit of his efforts.127 In the course of his professorial\ncareer, Hughes became respected for his contribution to the Cambridge school of\ngeology, perhaps more so than for his geological research.128 His obituary in The Times\ndescribes how Hughes devoted himself to three tasks. First, the defence of Sedgwick\u2019s\nversion of the Cambrian system in opposition to Murchison\u2019s views. Second, the pub-\nlication of The Life and Letters of the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, which was eventually\ncompleted with assistance. Third, the opening of the Sedgwick Museum in 1904 where\nWoodward\u2019s original collection was displayed alongside many new specimens.\nThe professorship next became vacant on Hughes\u2019s death on 9 June 1917. The new\nprofessor, John Edward Marr, had been one of Bonney\u2019s geological pupils at St John\u2019s\nCollege.129\n124 Joshua Fisher to Osmond Fisher, 23 February 1873, CUL (Add MS 7652\/V R\/19).\n125 W.

Hughes, \u2018Biographical notice of Adam Sedgwick\u2019, Yorkshire Geological and Polytechnic Society\nThe competition for the Woodwardian Chair of Geology, 1873 459\nThe Rev. Thomas George Bonney succeeded Professor John Morris in the Chair of\nGeology at University College in 1877. Bonney continued to work at St John\u2019s College\nfor some time, inspiring future generations of geologists. On retiring from University\nCollege he moved back to Cambridge. In autumn 1905 Hughes provided him with a\nroom at the Sedgwick Museum, where he taught as an informal demonstrator. Whilst\nHughes wrote his account on Sedgwick\u2019s life and work, it was Bonney who worked up a\nbook on Lyell\u2019s contribution to modern geology.130\nAlexander Henry Green left the Survey only a year after Hughes, having been elected\nto the Chair of Geology at Leeds in 1874. He seems to have been assisted by the\npatronage of Archibald Geikie, Director of the Survey of Scotland.131 In 1888 Green\nsucceeded Joseph Prestwich as Professor of Geology at Oxford. Sadly, his teaching\nburden left the disillusioned Green very little time to carry out original research.132\nWilliam Boyd Dawkins became Professor of Geology at Owen\u2019s College, Manchester in\n1874. He stood, unsuccessfully, for the Chair of Geology at Oxford in 1874 (the post\nwas offered to and accepted by Prestwich). Dawkins became increasingly involved with\neconomic geology. He advised on Channel tunnel schemes in the 1880s and helped to\ndiscover the Kent Coalfield.133 Dawkins was knighted in 1919. The Rev. Osmond Fisher\ncontinued his mathematical researches into geological subjects and in 1881 published\nPhysics of the Earth\u2019s Crust.134\nProfessor John Morris received the first award of the Lyell Medal and Fund from the\nGeological Society of London in 1876. He did not remain long in academic life and\nretired from the Chair of Geology at University College London in 1877. Professor Peter\nMartin Duncan continued as Professor of Geology and Palaeontology at King\u2019s College\nLondon. He worked on fossil echinoids and corals up to his death. The Rev. Peter\nBellinger Brodie remained at his living in Warwickshire and continued to build a geo-\nlogical reputation among local and national learned societies. Professor William King\ncontinued in his professorial duties at Queen\u2019s College, Galway. He was appointed to\nthe chair in natural history, geology and mineralogy in 1882, but only enjoyed this post\nfor a year, resigning in 1883 after a stroke.135\nThe outcome of the competition depended on a variety of influences. Some have been\nreconstructed from the correspondence generated in the preceding twenty-five days.\nPatronage was evidently as important as geological competence in acquiring votes,\nwhile candidates and their supporters devoted their attention to securing the favourable\n(1883), 255\u201369; J.

However, even the two main\ncandidates remained uncertain of their standing in the eyes of the electors until the\nresults were announced. It was evidently difficult to gauge the reactions of the\nCambridge electors. The backing of large and powerful colleges gave Bonney and\nHughes a great advantage, and the competition was made more piquant by the rivalry\nbetween John\u2019s and Trinity. Bonney\u2019s fame in Cambridge also played in his favour.\nHowever, Hughes won many votes through Charles Lyell\u2019s name, Mary Lyell\u2019s\ncampaigns and Sedgwick\u2019s posthumous support. His cause was probably also promoted\nby negative Survey gossip about Bonney and Dawkins.\nThe Woodwardian correspondence was partly directed towards the Cambridge-\nbased electors but it also reached out into a broader hinterland. Once the candidates\nstarted to seek out testimonials, geological authorities had to decide whom they\nthought most worthy of support. Professional opinion vied with personal friendship,\nand the reaction in geological spheres revealed some varied perceptions about the\nqualities of a competent geologist. We have seen the strong opinions held by Survey\nofficers and their bias towards the gentlemanly fieldworking geologist. When Bristow\ncommiserated with Fisher on losing the election, he added, \u2018At all events there is some\nsatisfaction in the knowledge that your opponent is a gentleman&well qualified withal\nfor the duties that will devolve upon him \u2013 & I would much rather he prevailed over\nyou than Bonney. \u2019136 Information was quietly and strategically transmitted down\nintricate webs of support and communication which flourished briefly during the course\nof the competition, such as the Whitaker\u2013Ingleby\u2013Luard chain.\nOn a broader scale, the range of backgrounds and fields of geological expertise of the\ncandidates illustrate the varied make-up of geology at this time. The Survey was a\npower of influential opinion as well as an unwilling training ground for future univer-\nsity professors, but non-salaried geologists still held a respectable position despite the\ngrowing professionalization of geology. This warns against any simple distinctions\nbetween professionals and amateurs, or professionals and clergymen. Brodie, though a\nshadowy figure in surviving correspondence, was regarded by Lyell as a \u2018good man\u2019; no\ncomment was made on Bonney\u2019s clerical background or Fisher\u2019s church living.137\nIt is difficult to force the outspoken opinions of geological competence provoked by\nthe Woodwardian competition into the framework and oppositions associated\nwith nineteenth-century professionalization. Some fields of geological research were\nregarded as more respectable than others. Fieldwork had a high value in the Survey.\nCandidates might glow in the reflected glory of geological supporters. Even personal\ncharacter was relevant to their success. This brief episode offers a vantage point from\nwhich to survey broader trends in nineteenth-century science. A comparison of the\nCambridge case with other competitions offers an intriguing topic for further research.\nThe immediate outcome of the Woodwardian competition was the appointment of a\nnew professor, but the twenty-five days of discussion beforehand provoked a quiet\nclarification of perceptions about geology and geologists.\n136 Henry Bristow to Osmond Fisher, 21 February 1873, CUL (Add MS 7652\/V R\/6).\n137 Lyell to Hughes, op. cit.
