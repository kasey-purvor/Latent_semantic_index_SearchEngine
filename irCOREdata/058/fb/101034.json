Carbon can hy-\nbridize with varying percentages of sp1 (acetylene-like), sp2\n(graphite-like), and sp3 (diamond-like) bonding.1 The pulsed\nlaser ablation (PLA) of graphite, in vacuum, has typically\nbeen used to produce smooth, hard, high density amorphous\ncarbon (a-C) films with high sp3 content (up to 90%)2,3 due\nto the local densification, on the impact of high energy C\natoms\/ions, favoring the formation of the sp3 phase. The op-\ntical properties of carbon films are largely governed by the\nsp2 phase, with the tribological properties determined by the\nsp3 phase. However, in these nanocomposite materials, some\ncare must be exercised in extracting and interpretation of the\nTauc band gap and the Urbach energy.\nPhotoluminescence (PL) in amorphous carbon, is\nthought to occur due to the radiative recombination of elec-\ntrons and holes in the band-tail states created by sp2 rich\nclusters.4,5 PL has been extensively studied for polymeric\na-C:H films,4,6,7 where an increase in the PL intensity has\nbeen observed for increasing H content.7 In this letter we\ninvestigate the PL properties of hydrogen-free a-C films de-\nposited by PLA of graphite in background pressures of ar-\ngon. Unlike in vacuum, these conditions have been shown to\nproduce low density nanostructured amorphous carbon\n(NAC) films.8,9 Such films have been shown to have useful\nproperties including low thresholds for electron emission10\nand high porosities.9\nFilms were deposited by PLA of a 99.999% pure pyro-\nlytic graphite target (Kurt J. Lesker) using a Lambda-Physik\nLPX 210i excimer laser operating at 248 nm. The laser pulse\nwas focused onto the rotating target, producing a fluence of\n,6 J \/cm2. The growth chamber was evacuated using a tur-\nbomolecular pump to 9310\u22128 Torr, then backfilled with ar-\ngon to the required pressure. Films were deposited onto Si\nsubstrates at a range of different background pressures of\nargon sPArd from 5 to 340 mTorr. The target to substrate dis-\ntance was fixed at 6 cm. Between 2000 and 5000 laser shots\nwere used, depending on the background pressure in order to\nkeep the film thickness constant as it was affected by PAr.\nThe morphology of the films was investigated in a Hita-\nchi S4000 field emission gun scanning electron microscope\n(SEM). The structure and bonding configuration in the films\nwas investigated by visible Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw\nRamanscope) using two different laser wavelengths 488 and\n514 nm. The PL measurements were also performed using\nthe system with the 488 nm laser, which was also equipped\nwith a cryostat (Oxford Instruments) that allowed measure-\nments at substrate temperatures down to 6 K.\nAfter deposition the surface morphology of the films was\nexamined in the SEM. Figure 1 shows SEM images of a\nrange of samples deposited at different PAr. At the lowest PAr\nused s5 mTorrd the films deposited were hard, scratch resis-\ntant and demonstrated a smooth morphology [see Fig. 1(a)].\nAs PAr was increased to 40 mTorr [Fig. 1(b)] the films be-\ncame much rougher and nanoscale clustering was observed\nin the SEM. The size of these clusters is estimated as\n15\u00b13 nm. As PAr was again increased to 100 mTorr, th-\neclustering of the film become more pronounced and the\nclusters became larger in size, ,45 nm. The films deposited\nat 100 mTorr could be easily scratched off with a pinpoint,\nindicating a much lower hardness. By 340 mTorr the film\nmorphology had changed from nanoscale clusters to more\na)Electronic mail: s.henley@eim.surrey.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

It was possible to remove these films by\nrubbing the surface, indicating a further reduction in film\ndensity with increasing PAr.\nAfter characterizing the structure of the films, the optical\nproperties were investigated using Raman and PL spectros-\ncopy. Figure 2(a) shows a series of PL spectra taken at room\ntemperature using visible s488 nmd excitation. These spectra\nshow a variety of features. First we observe the sharp Raman\nsignal at around 529 nm. For comparison these spectra have\nall been normalized to the intensity of the Raman peak. As\nthe thickness and porosity of the films varied with the back-\nground pressure, normalizing to the Raman peak is the only\nsensible method for comparing the luminescence. To a fair\napproximation, the Raman signal will be proportional to the\nfilm thickness. Higher in wavelength than the Raman signal\nis a broad PL feature that appears to be split into different\nbands. Figure 1(b) shows the spectra obtained from the film\ndeposited at PAr=80 mTorr, and has been fitted with four\nGaussian functions to separate the contribution of the differ-\nent bands. The first band, at around 575 nm, is quite sharp\nand appears not to vary significantly in intensity with PAr, so\nmaybe the second order Raman peak. The other bands how-\never, swap in relative intensity at different values of PAr.\nSimilar shaped PL spectra have been observed from a-C:H\nsamples deposited by dc-magnetron sputtering.7 The major-\nity of the PL intensity detected appears to come from the\nbroad band centered at around 700 nm. The intensity of this\nband increased as the PAr was raised. PL measurements were\nalso performed at low substrate temperatures s7 Kd, again\nusing 488 nm excitation, but only a weak temperature depen-\ndence of the PL was observed. A similar weak temperature\ndependence of the PL intensity has been observed in a-C:H\nsamples11 and can be associated with the broad band tail\nstates which give rise to highly localized and polarized intra-\nsp2-cluster PL emission.\nThe Raman spectrum for each sample was measured us-\ning 514 nm excitation. A selection of these spectra are shown\nin Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The Raman spectra are characterized\nas a combination of two bands, typically labeled the D and G\npeaks and are attributed to the breathing mode of aromatic\nrings and in-plane bondstretching of pairs of sp2 bonded C\natoms, respectively.12\u201314 For 514 nm excitation the D peak is\ntypically located at 1335 cm\u22121 and the G peak is typically\nfound in the range 1580\u00b120 cm\u22121. In order to characterize\nthe films, the Raman spectra were fitted using a Breit-\nWigner-Fano line for the G peak and a Lorentzian for the D\npeak.13 For the films deposited at low PAr (below\n,15 mTorr) the complete Raman line shape can be fitted\nwithout the need for the D peak. This is characteristic of\nta-C, where the ratio of the peak intensities of the D and G\npeaks sID \/ IGd tends towards zero as the fraction of sp3\nbonded C increases. As PAr increased the Raman line shapes\ncould only be fitted by including an increasing contribution\nof the D peak. This indicated that the fraction of sp2 bonded\nC present in the films increased, accompanied by an increase\nin ordering due to the formation of larger clusters of aromatic\nrings.13 The Raman data presented here are similar to those\nof Siegal et al.9 who saw little change in the Raman spectra\nwith increasing PAr, during PLA, in the range\n175\u2013300 mTorr. We also observe that, although the density\nof the films is very low, the Raman spectra are similar to\nthose of high density a-C, unlike the films deposited by\ncluster-assembly.15\nFor comparison the ratio ID \/ IG is plotted as a function of\nPAr in Fig. 4(a). Also plotted [Fig. 4(b)] is the relative PL\nintensity over the same pressure range. This was estimated\nby taking the area of the large broad band observed during\nthe fitting of the PL spectra [see Fig. 2(b)]. It can be readily\nobserved that the increase in the PL intensity correlates well\nwith the increase in ID \/ IG. This suggests that the enhanced\nPL, with increased PAr, is a consequence of carrier localiza-\ntion within an increasing number of sp2 rich clusters.\nAs PAr is increased the velocity of carbon atoms and\nions in the plume is expected to decrease due to collisions.\nBy imaging the optical emission from the plume (Henley et\nal., unpublished), it was demonstrated that the C+ ion veloc-\nity reduced from ,42 km\/s in vacuum (equivalent to a ki-\nFIG. 2.

The coalescence of these clusters produces the\nrough nanostructure observed in the SEM. However, by\nPAr=340 mTorr, the observed filamentary nature of the films\nmay be a due to the clusters arriving at energies too low for\ncoalescence to occur.\nIn conclusion, it has been shown that the PL intensity\nfrom hydrogen-free a-C, grown by PLA, increases as the PAr\nused during deposition, was increased. As the background\npressure was raised the film morphology changed from\nsmooth coatings to rough, nanostructured films and then onto\nlow-density filamentary growth. This transition was accom-\npanied by an increase in the ordering of the sp2 content of\nthe films, as measured by Raman spectroscopy. It is sug-\ngested that an increased PAr, during deposition, increases the\ndensity of sp2 rich clusters in the film. Carrier localization\nwithin these clusters is then responsible for the enhanced PL.\nS.J.H. would like to thank J. Filik, G. Fuge, P.W. May,\nand H.M.B.
