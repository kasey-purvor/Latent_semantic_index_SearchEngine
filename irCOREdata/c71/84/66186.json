Al-Namlah, Charles Fernyhough, and Elizabeth Meins \nUniversity of Durham \n \n \nIn press, Developmental Psychology \n \nVerbal Mediation     2 \nAbstract \nCross-national stability in private speech (PS) and short-term memory was investigated in \nSaudi Arabian (N = 63) and British (N = 58) 4- to 8-year-olds. Assumed differences in \nchild\u2013adult interaction between the 2 nationality groups led to predictions of gender-by-\nnationality interactions in the development of verbal mediation. British boys used more \nself-regulatory PS than British girls, while there was no such difference for the Saudi \ngroup. Controlling for age, verbal ability, and social speech, boys used marginally more \nself-regulatory PS than girls. Self-regulatory PS was related to children\u2019s use of \nphonological recoding of visually presented material in a short-term memory task, \nsuggesting that PS and phonological recoding represent different facets of a domain-\ngeneral transition toward verbal mediation in early childhood.  \n \nKey phrases: private speech, verbal mediation, phonological recoding, gender, cross-\nnational comparisons \n \nVerbal Mediation     3 \nSociocultural Influences on the Development of Verbal Mediation: Private Speech and \nPhonological Recoding in Saudi Arabian and British Samples \nThe question of how language and thought become developmentally intertwined \nin early childhood has long been of interest to psychologists. Vygotsky (1934\/1987) \nproposed that a revolution in cognitive development occurs when children begin to use \nsemiotic systems, primarily natural language, to augment and transform their \nprelinguistic cognitive capacities. On this account, the phenomenon of private speech \n(PS)\u2014speech that is not obviously addressed to any interlocutor\u2014represents the process \nthrough which language that initially serves a social communicative purpose comes to \nfulfil a self-regulatory function. Since Berk\u2019s (1992) landmark review, which concluded \nthat the evidence largely supports Vygotsky\u2019s interpretation of the phenomenon, there has \nbeen renewed interest in the self-regulatory functions of PS (Winsler, 2004). \nNevertheless, some of the central claims of Vygotsky\u2019s theory, such as that PS originates \nin social interaction and should therefore be influenced by sociocultural variables, have \nreceived relatively little attention.  \nIn parallel with this growth of interest in the verbal mediation of behavior and \ncognitive performance, researchers have continued to investigate the development of \nlinguistic mediation in another domain, that of short-term memory. Within the influential \nmodel of working memory presented by Baddeley and Hitch (1974; Baddeley, 1986), \nverbal mediation of memory performance is made possible by the rehearsal of \nphonological information in the articulatory loop component of the working memory \nsystem. An important shift in children\u2019s strategies for remembering occurs when children \nbegin spontaneously to use phonological rehearsal for visually presented material \nVerbal Mediation     4 \n(Baddeley, 1966, 1986; Conrad, 1971; Gathercole & Hitch, 1993). To date, however, \nindividual differences in the attainment of this developmental milestone, and the \nenvironmental and dispositional factors that might underlie them, have not been the focus \nof research.  \nEarly childhood is therefore a time of profound change in the use of verbal \nmediation in at least two domains: self-regulation of cognitive performance, and \nphonological rehearsal of mnemonic material. The aim of the study reported here was to \nattempt to bring these areas of research together by examining evidence for an across-the-\nboard shift toward verbal mediation in early childhood. Sociocultural influences on these \ndevelopmental processes are examined in the context of cross-national comparisons and \ngender differences. \nVerbal Mediation of Cognitive Performance \nThere is now a substantial body of evidence supporting Vygotsky\u2019s claims about \nthe self-regulatory functions of PS. Empirical research inspired by his ideas has shown \nPS use to be related in meaningful ways to social context (Goudena, 1987), task difficulty \n(Behrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1989; Kohlberg, Yaeger, & Hjertholm, 1968), and to \nboth concurrent (Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005; Winsler, Diaz, McCarthy, Atencio, & \nAdams Chabay, 1999) and future (Behrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1992; Bivens & \nBerk, 1990) task performance.  \n Researchers have also investigated Vygotsky\u2019s claims about changes in the form \nand function of PS over childhood. Support has been found for the suggestion that PS \ndrops away in middle childhood as verbal mediation becomes internalized (Kohlberg et \nal., 1968), although there is also a growing awareness that self-regulatory speech can be a \nVerbal Mediation     5 \nvaluable cognitive strategy well into adulthood (Duncan & Cheyne, 2002). PS has been \nobserved to follow a trajectory from overt, task-irrelevant utterances to utterances that \nappear to have a role in the self-regulation of behavior, and ultimately to semi-covert \nwhispering and muttering (Kohlberg et al., 1968; Patrick & Abravanel, 2000; Winsler, \nDiaz, & Montero, 1997). In Berk\u2019s (1986) coding scheme, more \u201cadvanced\u201d forms of PS \n(primarily those concerned with self-regulation) are assumed gradually to replace more \nimmature ones (such as task-irrelevant affect expression). Evidence for this \ndevelopmental progression has been found in a number of studies (Berk, 1986; Berk & \nGarvin, 1984; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Winsler, de Leon, Wallace, Carlton, & Willson-\nQuayle, 2003). For example, in their large (N = 2,156) cross-sectional sample, Winsler \nand Naglieri (2003) showed that the use of overt task-relevant PS decreased over middle \nchildhood, while the use of covert varieties of self-talk (presumably reflecting \nprogressive internalization) increased over the same period.  \n One important, and relatively neglected, question that arises from Vygotsky\u2019s \ntheory is the extent to which social and cultural variables influence the shift to verbal \nmediation. Vygotsky (1934\/1987) argued that self-regulatory speech arises out of the \ngradual internalization of social exchanges between children and adults. Children with \nimpoverished experiences of such exchanges should therefore be delayed in their \ndevelopment of self-regulatory PS. Diaz, Neal, and Vachio (1991) found lower rates of \ntask-relevant PS in a sample of high-risk preschoolers from low-income families with a \nhistory of child abuse, contexts in which responsive communication between adults and \nchildren could be expected to be severely impaired. In their study of PS in Appalachian \nchildren, born into a culture where verbal communication between adults and children is \nVerbal Mediation     6 \nless extensive than in typical Western samples, Berk and Garvin (1984) found evidence \nthat PS development was delayed. For example, 40% of the private utterances produced \nby the Appalachian 10-year-olds remained highly audible, whereas Kohlberg et al.\u2019s \n(1968) data from a predominantly middle-class American sample suggested that PS is \ntypically almost completely internalized by this age. However, Berk and Garvin (1984) \ndid not include in their study a typical American sample for direct comparison with the \nAppalachian children. To date, no study has examined social and cultural influences on \nPS development in the context of a cross-cultural study. Attempting such an investigation \nwas the first main aim of the study reported here.  \n Another important sociocultural variable, which in some circumstances might \naffect children\u2019s opportunities for reciprocal linguistic exchanges with others, is gender. \nThe evidence for gender differences in PS use has been somewhat mixed. Although \nfinding no effects of gender on overall PS rates, Berk and Garvin (1984) reported that the \nboys in their Appalachian sample used more of the \u201cimmature\u201d forms of PS, such as \negocentric communication, than their female counterparts. Winsler et al. (1999) found \nhigher PS use among boys during task collaborations with their mothers, although not \nduring individual task performance. In their large cross-sectional study, Winsler and \nNaglieri (2003) found no effect of gender on overt or covert verbal strategy use. One \ndifficulty in interpreting findings of gender effects is that, in the absence of longitudinal \ndata, it remains uncertain whether children who produce fewer PS utterances are less \nadvanced in the developmental process of internalization, and are yet to reach their \nhypothesized peak of PS use, or whether, conversely, they have already passed their PS \npeak and have therefore largely internalized their speech.  \nVerbal Mediation     7 \nVerbal Mediation of Short-Term Memory \nThe emergence of verbal mediation has also been studied in the area of memory \ndevelopment. One of the most important questions in such research is how young \nchildren come to be able to recruit existing cognitive resources to the rehearsal and \nmaintenance of material presented in different modalities. In the preschool years, \nmemory for visually presented stimuli appears to be primarily dependent upon \nvisuospatial working memory, as evidenced by the appearance of the visual similarity \neffect (Hitch, Halliday, Schaafstal, & Schraagen, 1988; Longoni & Scalisi, 1994; Palmer, \n2000a), where sequences of items of similar visual form are recalled less accurately than \nvisually distinct items. At a slightly later stage in development, children show \nsusceptibility to the phonological similarity effect (PSE) in visual presentation, where \nrecall of phonologically similar items (e.g., man, map, mat) is worse than recall of \nphonologically dissimilar items (e.g., clock, horse, fish) (Baddeley, 1966, 1986; Conrad, \n1971; Gathercole & Hitch, 1993). Within the working memory framework (Baddeley, \n1986; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974), the PSE is attributed to the phonological recoding of \nvisually presented material so that it can be rehearsed using the articulatory loop. \nWhereas spoken material is thought to have automatic access to the articulatory loop, \nvisual inputs such as pictures must be recoded phonologically before they can be held in \nthis component of working memory (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993).  \nAlthough there is some disagreement about the precise chronology of the shift to \nphonological recoding (Ford & Silber, 1994; Hulme, 1987; Palmer, 2000a), there is a \nconsensus that children undergo a fundamental shift in strategy at around age 6, away \nfrom visuospatial coding of visually presented material and toward phonological \nVerbal Mediation     8 \nrecoding. This shift has been related variously to children\u2019s adoption of a conscious \nstrategy for memorizing visually presented material (Flavell, Beach, & Chinsky, 1966), \nto the gradual decoupling of the phonological short-term memory system from the \nstimulus of overt speech (Hitch, Halliday, Schaafstal, & Heffernan, 1991), and to changes \nin central executive functioning (Palmer, 2000a). Palmer (2000a) has presented evidence \nthat the shift to phonological recoding involves a period of dual coding when information \nis stored both phonologically and visuospatially. As explained below (see Method), this \nraises the possibility of determining the extent of phonological recoding by measuring the \nextra memory capacity available for items that are not susceptible to phonological \nconfusion. \n Despite the wealth of evidence now available on the shift to phonological \nrecoding in early childhood, little is known about the variables that might influence this \ntransition. Studies of individual differences in susceptibility to the PSE have been limited \nto examining its value as a predictor of later educational achievement, such as literacy \nacquisition (Palmer, 2000b). To date, no study has investigated phonological recoding as \nan outcome of development, either in terms of individual differences in pre-existing \ncognitive capacities, or in terms of the sociocultural variables that might be expected to \ninfluence the acquisition of a phonological recoding strategy.  \n One way of understanding such potential cognitive and sociocultural influences is \nprovided by Vygotsky\u2019s theory. According to this account, the gradual internalization of \nsocial speech, through the intermediate form of PS, should increase the child\u2019s \nopportunities to benefit from verbal mediation in a range of cognitive domains, including \nshort-term memory. To put it another way, the across-the-board shift toward semiotic \nVerbal Mediation     9 \nmediation envisaged by Vygotsky should be evidenced in children\u2019s developing use of \nmediational strategies in memory tasks, as well as in their PS on non-memory tasks. \nAlthough he did not directly consider the phenomenon of phonological recoding, \nVygotsky (1978) was explicit about the developing mediation of memory by artificial \nmeans. Drawing on the results of Leont\u2019ev (1932), he argued that, by the time they reach \nschool age, children are able spontaneously to use external artifacts in mediating \nmemory. To date, there have been only limited attempts to replicate Vygotsky and \ncolleagues\u2019 findings on the development of mediated memory (see Lloyd & Fernyhough, \n1999), and the influence of sociocultural variables on this process has yet to be \ndetermined.   \n What sociocultural factors might be relevant in this respect? One way of \napproaching this question is to investigate whether the shift to phonological recoding \nproceeds at different rates in different cultures. For example, some cultural contexts may \nencourage children to use verbal mediation in cognitive tasks, while others may entail \nimplicit or explicit discouragement of such strategies. In addition, cultural contexts might \ndiffer in the extent to which they allow children to engage in the sort of interaction with \nadults and peers that Vygotsky considered to drive the development of verbal mediation. \nTo date, there has been no systematic investigation of cross-cultural differences in the \nshift to verbal mediation of short-term memory. Addressing this gap in the literature was \nthe second main aim of the study reported here.  \nThe Development of Verbal Mediation in Sociocultural Context: Rationale for a Cross-\nNational Comparison \nVerbal Mediation     10 \n The above review suggests that there are important gaps in our knowledge of how \nthe sociocultural context of development impacts upon children\u2019s developing use of \nverbal mediation. Our rationale for investigating this issue in a cross-national study was \nthat it would allow us to draw on previous observations of cultural differences relevant to \nour chosen samples. It is important to note that it was beyond the scope of our study to \ninvestigate these cultural differences directly. Rather, we based our hypotheses on \nprevious research into the different experiences of boys and girls within these and other \nsimilar cultures.  \n We selected two countries whose dominant cultural practices were likely to have \ndiffering effects on children\u2019s use of language and verbal strategies: the United Kingdom \n(UK) and Saudi Arabia. These cultures were chosen because of previously reported \ndifferences in (a) societal values relating to individualism and collectivism, (b) societal \nvalues relating to gender, and (c) educational practices. Cross-national differences in \nthese practices, and their possible implications for the use of verbal mediation, are \nexamined in turn.  \nSocietal Values Relating to Individualism and Collectivism \n Markus and Kitayama (1991, 1994) suggest that cultures can be distinguished by \ntheir position along a dimension of individualism and collectivism. Collectivistic cultures \nemphasize interdependence among individuals and the importance of interlocking \nresponsibilities and obligations within social units such as the family (Markus & \nKitayama, 1991). In contrast, individualistic cultures, such as predominate in the US and \nUK, place greater value on autonomy, independence, individual privacy, and the \nattainment of personal goals (Hofstede, 1980). In general, Arab societies have been \nVerbal Mediation     11 \ncharacterised as collectivistic (Barakat, 1993; Dwairy, 2004; Mikulincer, Weller, & \nFlorian, 1993; Scharf & Hertz-Lazarowitz, 2003). In many Saudi Arabian families, \nindividuals\u2019 behavior is strongly organized and influenced by other people, and children\u2019s \nrelationships with parents and other family members are governed by respect and \ndeference (Al-Garni, 2000; Al-Sudairi, 2000; Anderson, 2001). Although researchers \nhave not directly investigated whether the collectivistic nature of Saudi society influences \nchildren\u2019s interactions with others, this question has been addressed in other collectivistic \ncultures. For example, Mullen and Yi (1995) reported that, compared with their \nAmerican counterparts, Korean mothers talked to their children less frequently over the \ncourse of a day, and conversations about past events focused on social discipline and \nmorals. In contrast, American mothers\u2019 conversations tended to center around their \nchildren\u2019s personal characteristics, preferences, and interests. \n Another area in which the collectivistic nature of Saudi culture might influence \nthe social opportunities available to children relates to Baumrind\u2019s (1971) distinction \nbetween authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles. Authoritative parenting is \ncharacterized by parental warmth and positivity in relationships coupled with firmness \nand consistency. Authoritarian parents, in contrast, can be relatively distant and critical, \nas well as strict in their adherence to rules. In their study of UK mothers, Thompson, \nRaynor, Cornah, Stevenson, and Sonuga-Barke (2002) reported roughly equal \noccurrences of authoritative and authoritarian parenting in mothers\u2019 self-reports. \nAlthough comparable studies have not been conducted in Saudi Arabia, Al-Garni (2000) \nnoted how parents in Saudi Arabia tend to be authoritarian in their interactions with their \nchildren, and to have asymmetrical parent\u2013child relationships, with parents being \u201cthe \nVerbal Mediation     12 \nones who command and order, and the children\u2026 the ones who obey and follow\u201d (pp. \n39-40). Although some believe that parenting practices are changing as a result of the \neconomic boom and the spread of formal, Western-style education in Saudi Arabia \nduring the last three decades (Al-Saif, 2003), the traditional adult-centered approach to \nparenting is still widely adopted (Al-Banyan, 1980; Al-Sudairi, 2000).  \n The collectivistic nature of Saudi society might therefore affect children\u2019s \nopportunities for reciprocal social exchanges in different ways. On the one hand, a more \ncollectivistic culture might be expected to knit children more tightly into the social \nexchanges, particularly with adults and more expert peers, that Vygotsky regarded to \nunderpin the development of verbal mediation. On the other hand, the fact that children\u2019s \nbehavior tends to be organized and influenced by their superiors might mean that their \ndevelopment of strategies to regulate their own behavior might be limited, at least until \nthey reach adolescence and adulthood. In terms of possible hypotheses about cross-\nnational comparisons in the development of verbal mediation, the available evidence \nrelating to individualism and collectivism therefore cuts both ways.  \nSocietal Values Relating to Gender \n As in any culture, boys and girls tend to be treated differently in Saudi Arabia. \nArab culture in general is often characterised as patriarchal, with power residing with the \nmenfolk, and women generally not party to important decisions (Barakat, 1993). Saudi \nsociety is also strongly segregated along gender lines, with boys and men staying together \nand female family members often occupying different parts of the house (Albers, 1989). \nGender segregation, coupled with the fact that power resides primarily with adult males, \nmeans that Saudi boys are frequently party to important discussions among the menfolk, \nVerbal Mediation     13 \nwhilst being prohibited from directly contributing (Seginer & Vermulst, 2002). In \ncontrast, the traditional segregation of Saudi females means that girls are encouraged to \ntalk and express themselves during frequent social gatherings with women and other \ngirls. Reporting on a sample of Palestinian-Arab adolescents in Israel (considered \nrepresentative of Arab populations in general), Dwairy (2004) found that girls reported \ntheir own parents to use more authoritative than authoritarian styles, with the direction of \neffect reversed for boys. Assuming that these findings generalize to Saudi samples, one \nwould therefore expect Saudi girls to enjoy more reciprocal and less controlling \ninteractions with their parents than their male counterparts.  \n These differences in treatment of boys and girls are distinct from patterns of \ninteraction in many British families, where boys are not typically privileged above girls \nin their inclusion in adult discussions. In their meta-analysis of studies investigating \ndifferential socialization of boys and girls in North American samples, Lytton and \nRomney (1991) found no significant differences between boys and girls in the amount of \ntime spent interacting with parents, the amount of verbal interaction engaged in, nor in \nlevels of parental restrictiveness or discipline. Assuming that these findings generalize to \nBritish samples, previous findings lead us to predict no gender differences in those forms \nof child\u2013adult interaction that might be considered relevant to the development of verbal \nmediation.  \n These postulated cross-national differences led us to hypothesize interactions \nbetween nationality and gender in the development of verbal mediation. With regard to \nthe British sample, previous findings of no gender differences in child\u2013adult interaction, \nand no clear differences in PS use, led us to predict no gender effects in PS use or \nVerbal Mediation     14 \nphonological recoding. With regard to the Saudi sample, our assumption was that Saudi \ngirls would experience levels of interaction with adults (albeit predominantly with female \nfamily members) similar to those of British children. We expected Saudi boys\u2019 less \nextensive participation in interactions with adults to lead to a corresponding delay in the \nshift to verbal mediation. At the same time, we predicted no main effect of gender on \neither PS use or phonological recoding.  \nCross-National Differences in Educational Practices \n Important differences also exist between the two nationality groups in children\u2019s \neducational experience. In educational systems in the US and UK, the early years of \nprimary school are characterized by learning through play, with children generally being \nafforded opportunities to talk to themselves and others as they learn. Deniz (2004) \nreported that, although American early-years teachers differed widely in their attitudes to \nPS among their charges, such utterances were typically tolerated in the classroom. In \ncomparison, Saudi children are taught by a more traditional method from an early age, \nwith \u201can emphasis on factual knowledge, lecturing, textbooks, memorization, homework, \ndiscipline, and testing\u201d (Alotaibi, 1993, p. 80; see also Al-Saif, 2003). Although there \nhave not yet been any studies of teachers\u2019 attitudes to PS in non-Western societies, it \nseems plausible that the formal atmosphere in the typical Saudi classroom might \ndiscourage, either implicitly or explicitly, this form of verbal self-regulation.  \n What implications might such educational differences have for the hypotheses of \nthe present study? Again, we suggest that the available evidence pulls in different \ndirections. On the one hand, the more formal and traditional Saudi educational ethos \nmight be expected to give children fewer opportunities for self-talk and constructive \nVerbal Mediation     15 \nreciprocal dialogue with peers and teachers. These differences will in turn impact upon \nthe process of internalization of social and private speech. On the other hand, the \nemphasis on rote learning and memorization might mean that Saudi children will be at an \nadvantage in verbal mediation, at least as it relates to short-term recall performance.  \nIndividual Differences in the Development of Verbal Mediation: Testing Vygotskian \nHypotheses \nThe foregoing review describes sociocultural differences between Saudi Arabia \nand the UK that would seem to have implications for the development of verbal \nmediation. Our expectation was that these group differences would not show up in main \neffects of nationality or gender. Rather, we predicted cross-national stability in the shift \nto verbal mediation on both a non-memory cognitive task and a task involving immediate \nserial recall of visually presented material. That is, Saudi and British children were \nexpected to be equivalent in their use of PS and phonological recoding. Our prediction \nwas that differences in cultural practices would be manifested in interactions between \nnationality and gender in our two measures of verbal mediation: PS and phonological \nrecoding. Specifically, it was expected that Saudi boys would show less verbal mediation \nthan either their female compatriots or children in the UK.  \nOur first two research aims were therefore to shed light on potential cultural \ndifferences in the shift to verbal mediation in two different cognitive domains. The real \ntest of Vygotsky\u2019s ideas, however, would come from evidence that the development of \nverbal mediation in these two domains is linked. Our third main aim was thus to \ndetermine whether children\u2019s use of self-regulatory PS was related to their tendency to \nuse phonological recoding of visually presented material.  \nVerbal Mediation     16 \n The possibility that children\u2019s use of self-regulatory speech might relate to \nmemory performance was first raised in a landmark study by Flavell et al. (1966), who \ninvestigated spontaneous verbal rehearsal among children aged 5, 7, and 10 years. In \naddition to the expected age-related increase in the use of verbal rehearsal strategies, \nFlavell et al. reported two further important findings. First, within each age group, there \nwere individual differences in children\u2019s engagement in verbal rehearsal, with children \nwho used such strategies demonstrating better recall than their same-age peers who did \nnot. This suggests that the use of verbal rehearsal is not solely determined by \nmaturational factors, but is also dependent on children\u2019s adoption of verbal strategies to \nregulate their behavior. Second, Flavell et al. reported that teachers were accurate in \npredicting which children would engage in subvocal rehearsal during the memory task, \nhighlighting the fact that children who tend to rely on verbal strategies to aid recall also \nuse speech more generally to regulate their behavior.  \n Although researchers in the field of memory development have continued to be \ninterested in the shift to phonological recoding as part of a general transition toward the \nverbal mediation of cognitive processes (Ford & Silber, 1994; Hitch et al., 1991), no \nempirical investigations of this possibility have been conducted since the work of Flavell \net al. (1966) and Conrad (1971). Furthermore, these important early studies did not \ninvestigate children\u2019s use of verbal mediation outside the context of working memory \ntasks. Our aim was therefore to conduct the first empirical test of the association between \nmnemonic and non-mnemonic verbal mediation. Specifically, we asked whether children \nwho used more self-regulatory PS on a non-memory task were more likely to engage in \nphonological recoding in a separate recall task. Evidence that the shift to verbal \nVerbal Mediation     17 \nmediation is not limited to any particular cognitive domain would provide strong support \nfor Vygotsky\u2019s claims about the increasing importance of verbal mediation in children\u2019s \ncognition.   \n The present study tested five main hypotheses: (1) that there would be cross-\nnational stability in PS use, with no main effect of nationality on PS rates; (2) that there \nwould be an interaction between nationality and gender in PS use, with Saudi boys \nproducing fewer PS utterances than Saudi girls and children in the UK; (3) that there \nwould be cross-national stability in the use of phonological recoding, as indexed by \nsusceptibility to the PSE; (4) that there would be an interaction between nationality and \ngender in susceptibility to the PSE, with Saudi boys being less susceptible than children \nin the other groups; and (5) that children\u2019s use of phonological recoding would correlate \npositively with their use of self-regulatory PS.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nThe 121 participants were drawn from two countries: the UK and Saudi Arabia. \nThe British sample consisted of 58 children (50% girls) attending a primary school in a \nsmall city in the North-East of England. The catchment area for the school included a mix \nof private and public housing, and the percentage of children entitled to free school meals \n(indicating socioeconomic disadvantage) was well below the national average. All of the \nchildren were White and spoke English as their native language; they ranged in age from \n53 to 92 months (M = 72.6, SD = 10.8). The Saudi Arabian sample consisted of 63 \nchildren (44% girls) attending a complex of private schools in a major city. Private \nschools were used for recruitment of the Saudi sample because of the male researcher\u2019s \nVerbal Mediation     18 \ndifficulty in gaining access to all-girl state schools. Private education in Saudi Arabia, \nalthough segregated by gender, typically involves boys and girls being taught in the same \nschool complex, which in this case made the task of gaining access to female students \nconsiderably easier. Private and public schools in Saudi Arabia are considered to be fully \ncomparable in terms of their curriculum and other educational programmes and activities, \nas well as educational ideology. All of the children were Saudi Arabian and spoke Arabic \nas their native language; they ranged in age from 53 to 97 months (M = 76.6, SD = 11.2). \nThe significance of this small difference in age between the samples is investigated \nfurther in the Results section.  \nOverview of Procedure \n The male experimenter was a native Arabic speaker of Saudi Arabian origin who \nwas also fluent in English. Children were tested individually in the school library (UK) or \nschool theatre (Saudi Arabia), with the experimenter sitting adjacent to the child. \nParticipants were seen on three occasions. The first testing session began with an \nassessment of children\u2019s general verbal ability, followed by the PS measures. \nApproximately 3 weeks later, one of two memory tasks was administered. The second \nmemory task was administered in the final session, conducted approximately 1 week after \nthe second session.  \nPrivate Speech Measures  \nA manual version of an executive planning task, the Tower of London (ToL: \nShallice, 1982) was used to elicit children\u2019s PS. The ToL has been found to be an \nappropriate task for eliciting self-regulatory PS (Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005). The task \nwas also considered to be likely to be relatively unfamiliar to children of both \nVerbal Mediation     19 \nnationalities. The ToL used in the present study consisted of three pegs of differing \nlengths inserted into a wooden base measuring 20cm \u00d7 7cm \u00d7 2cm, and three colored \ncotton reels (red, green, and blue). The lengths of the pegs were such that one would \naccommodate three reels, one would accommodate two reels, and the shortest peg only \none reel. Two identical copies of the ToL were used, one showing the child the target \nconfiguration of the reels, the other (which the child manipulated) presented in the same \nstandard initial configuration. \n The experimenter showed the child the two ToL puzzles, explaining that the \nobject of the game was to make the standard ToL configuration look like the target \nconfiguration. The child was then told that there were some special rules of the game: (a) \nonly one reel could be moved at a time; and (b) every reel had to be on a peg, and reels \ncould not be placed on the table or held in the hand. To help children adhere to these \nrules, they were asked to place their non-preferred hand behind their backs. Participants \nwere then told: \u201cSome children like to talk out loud to themselves when they play this \ngame. You can do that if you like. I bet in class you have to be quiet, but when you\u2019re \nplaying this game with me, you can talk as much as you like\u201d. This instruction was \nincluded in response to Frauenglass and Diaz\u2019s (1985) observation that elicitation of task-\nrelevant PS is maximized when children are given an explicit invitation to talk aloud to \nthemselves when working on a task.  \n Children were given two practice trials, each involving only two reels (green and \nblue). The experimenter then added the red reel and presented the first target \nconfiguration, saying: \u201cNow, can you make this (indicating the standard apparatus) look \nlike this? (indicating the target apparatus).\u201d Timing for performance measures began as \nVerbal Mediation     20 \nsoon as the experimenter had finished this last utterance, and the same time-point served \nas the starting point for subsequent videotape coding of children\u2019s speech.  \n Each participant attempted the same four trials, in increasing order of difficulty. \nThe simplest trial required a minimum of two moves to achieve the target configuration, \nthe next trial three moves, the next four moves, and the final trial five moves. If a child \nbecame stuck, distracted or upset, the experimenter intervened, resetting the puzzle if \nnecessary. In such instances, which were rare (less than 5% of trials), only the second \nattempt at the problem was coded. At all other times the experimenter sat quietly to one \nside, answering any direct questions but otherwise keeping his involvement to a \nminimum.  \n Speech was coded from videotapes of the ToL sessions. The procedure involved \nassigning each utterance to a superordinate category (social or private), and then further \nsub-dividing private utterances according to overtness and task relevance. An utterance \nwas defined as any segment of speech containing (a) no temporal pause that exceeded 2s, \nand (b) no semantic discontinuity (i.e., a change of content or subject, whether or not it \nwas preceded by a 2s pause). Utterances were classified as social speech if: (a) the child \nsustained eye contact with the experimenter during or within 2s of the utterance; (b) the \nchild\u2019s behavior involved the experimenter (e.g., through physical contact or extension of \narm toward the experimenter) during or within 2s of the utterance; (c) the experimenter\u2019s \nbehavior involved the child (through physical contact or an action attracting the child\u2019s \ngaze) during or within 2s of the utterance; (d) the utterance had the same topic as the \nexperimenter\u2019s preceding utterance (one that ended no more than 2s before the child\u2019s \nbegan); (e) the utterance was a question directed to the experimenter, where an answer \nVerbal Mediation     21 \nappeared to be expected; (f) the utterance contained a vocative or name; (g) the utterance \noccurred less than 2s after any social speech utterance. Any utterance that did not meet \nany of the above criteria was classified as PS.  \n All PS utterances were further categorized in terms of their overtness and \nrelevance to task behavior using Berk\u2019s (1986) three-level scheme. Level 1 private \nspeech (PS1) consisted of task-irrelevant overt utterances, including word play and \nrepetition, task-irrelevant affect expressions, and comments to absent, imaginary, or \nnonhuman others. Level 2 private speech (PS2) consisted of task-relevant, overt \nutterances, including describing one\u2019s own activity and self-guiding comments, self-\nanswered questions, and task-relevant affect expressions (e.g., \u201cI did it!\u201d, \u201cThis is hard\u201d). \nLevel 3 private speech (PS3) consisted of task-relevant partially covert utterances, \nincluding inaudible muttering and whispering, and silent, verbal lip and tongue \nmovements. \n All of the ToL sessions were coded for social speech and PS by a trained \nresearcher who was blind to the other measures, and a randomly-chosen quarter of the \ntapes was coded by a second, blind researcher. Inter-rater agreement for assignment of \nspeech across the social speech and the three PS categories was \u03ba = 0.77. Disagreements \nmainly concerned whether children\u2019s lip movements indicated PS3, and were resolved by \ndiscussion. Children received frequency scores for the number of social speech, PS1, \nPS2, and PS3 utterances made during the session. Rate measures (utterances per minute) \nfor the different speech categories were derived by dividing these frequency scores by the \ntotal amount of time spent on the task.  \nMemory Measures \nVerbal Mediation     22 \n Memory for phonologically similar and dissimilar items was assessed in separate \nsessions. Children were randomly assigned to start with either the similar or the \ndissimilar items. The memory task was selected to be equally appropriate to both \nsamples, with children in both nationality groups assumed to be familiar with rote \nlearning.  \n Phonologically similar items. For both the British and Saudi children, the test \nstimuli consisted of a set of eight simple line drawings of common objects, mounted on \ncards sized 35 by 25 cm. For the British children, the pictures were taken from a selection \nof early word books published by Ladybird Books. All object names were high-\nfrequency, monosyllabic, concrete nouns that were familiar to the children: cat, car, \nclown, cow, clock, cake, keys, cot.  \nPreparation of a comparable set of pictures suitable for the Saudi children \ninvolved several stages. First, Arabic names of common objects familiar to children were \ncollected. A selection of books published by Dar Al-Manhal for Publishing and \nDistributing, Amman, Jordan, was used for this purpose. The requirement that the to-be-\nremembered words were monosyllabic was not always met because most monosyllabic \nArabic words have abstract meanings, unfamiliar to young children. The set of selected \npictures was then piloted on a separate, small (N = 6) group of children aged between 4 \nand 8 years in order to establish whether any of the words were poorly understood. None \nof the children encountered any problems with comprehension. The set of phonologically \nsimilar Arabic words was (with transliterations in parentheses): pencil (qalam), boat \n(qareb), monkey (qerred), cat (qet), cage (qafas), foot (qadam), train (qetar), moon \n(qamar). \nVerbal Mediation     23 \n Phonologically dissimilar items. The stimuli for the British children consisted of \neight line drawings representing the following set of high-frequency monosyllabic nouns: \nhouse, dog, lamp, glass, tree, flag, shoe, ball. For the Saudi children, the procedure \noutlined above was used to identify suitable phonologically dissimilar items, although \nagain it was not possible to meet the requirement of being monosyllabic. The test items \nfor the Saudi children were: scissors (maqus), eye (aain), bell (jaras), duck (butta), box \n(sandooq), horse (hessan), clock (sa\u2019ah), apple (toffaha). \n Both of the memory sessions (phonologically similar items and phonologically \ndissimilar items) began with the picture cards being laid on the table. The child was then \nasked to name the pictures one by one. None of the children had any difficulty in naming \nall of the pictures. The experimenter then introduced the memory task, stating that the \npoint of the game was to try to remember the names of the objects shown on the cards, \nand to recall them in the order in which they had been presented.  \n The present study\u2019s focus on the spontaneous emergence of verbal mediation of \nmemory meant that steps were taken to eliminate overt naming of the items at \npresentation. Overt naming has been shown to encourage phonological recoding of \nvisually presented material in an immediate recall task (Ford & Silber, 1994). We were \ninterested in children\u2019s spontaneous use of covert phonological recoding, as a \nmanifestation of the use of a verbal mediation strategy, which would have been \nconfounded by individual differences, perhaps related to impulsivity, in children\u2019s \ntendency spontaneously to name items presented to them. Accordingly, the experimenter \nexplained that the child had to be silent during presentation of the stimuli, and had to \nplace a finger over his or her lips in order to ensure silence. Palmer (2000a) showed that \nVerbal Mediation     24 \nprohibiting overt labelling using the same \u2018finger on lips\u2019 procedure had no effect on 3- \nto 7-year-old children\u2019s recall of sequences of pictures in a similar task, concluding that \nlabelling neither enhances nor hinders recall for any type of visual stimulus. That said, \nthe requirement of keeping a finger to one\u2019s lips while remaining silent clearly \ncontributes an executive component to the demands of the task, the possible implications \nof which are considered in the Discussion.  \n The experimenter then demonstrated the memory task by looking silently at a \nseries of two pictures, viewing each picture for 2s before placing it face down, and \nrepeating the items pictured in order of presentation. Children were told that they could \nsay \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d in place of an item whose position they knew but whose name they had \nforgotten, and that they should recall the items as soon as the last card had been placed \nface down. The child was then given 3 two-word lists as practice, with a reminder of the \nprohibition on labelling at presentation and the importance of recalling the items in the \ncorrect order. None of the children had any difficulties with the practice trials. \n The test trials consisted of 10 trials for both the phonologically similar items (PSI) \nand phonologically dissimilar items (PDI), each of which involved the visual presentation \nof three picture cards. Each picture was held in front of the child for 2s, and then placed \nface down on the table. The child was given 30s to recall the list. The same 10 three-\npicture combinations were used for all children, but the presentation of the trials within \nthe PSI and PDI sets was randomized. All sessions were videotaped for later scoring. \n For each of the PSI and PDI trials, children received 2 points for recalling an item \nin the correct position, and 1 point if a correct item was recalled in the wrong position. \nVerbal Mediation     25 \nPerfect recall for a three-item trial therefore received a score of 6, giving a maximum \nscore of 60 for the block of 10 PSI trials, and 60 for the PDI block. \n Determining the extent of phonological recoding. As noted in the Introduction, \nprevious research has tended to treat the PSE as an all-or-nothing phenomenon, with little \nconsideration of how individual differences in the effect relate to developmental \nprecursors and sequelae. In line with previous studies, we investigated the presence of the \nPSE by conducting within-subject comparisons between recall for PSI and PDI stimuli. \nOur assumption was that the difference between PDI and PSI scores represents the extra \nmemory capacity gained by the shift to phonological recoding. If this assumption is \ncorrect, PSI scores represent the memory capacity provided by a non-verbal, \npredominantly visual store which, before the onset of phonological recoding, is \npresumably primarily responsible for the encoding of visually presented material. The \nextra capacity provided by phonological recoding, during a period of dual visual and \nphonological coding (Palmer, 2000a), makes the difference between PDI and PSI scores \n(see Figure 1). Thus, PDI scores can be taken as a measure of verbal mediation of short-\nterm memory, when PSI scores are simultaneously controlled for in regression analyses. \nThis method of analysis (detailed further in the Results section) allowed us to control for \nchildren\u2019s baseline memory performance in a way that a simple subtraction method \n(PDI\u2013PSI) would not.  \nVerbal Ability \n Verbal ability was measured in light of previous findings of a relation with PS \n(Berk & Spuhl, 1995; Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; Kohlberg et al., 1968). The British \nchildren\u2019s verbal ability was assessed using the British Picture Vocabulary Scale II \nVerbal Mediation     26 \n(BPVS II: Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, 1997), and the Saudi children were assessed \nusing the Verbal Development Scale (VDS). The VDS is a sub-scale of the Children\u2019s \nAdaptive Behavior Scale (Richmond & Hicklighter, 1980) that was standardized on \nSaudi children aged between 4 and 12 years by Al-Shukhs (1998).  \nResults \nDescriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analyses \n Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for background variables, speech \nmeasures derived from the ToL, and memory task performance, as functions of \nnationality and gender. (Note that the raw speech frequency and memory means are given \nfor descriptive purposes, and therefore statistically significant differences are not marked \non the table.) An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests except where stated. A \n2 (nationality) \u00d7 2 (gender) ANOVA with age as the dependent variable showed that the \nSaudi children were marginally significantly older, F(1, 117) = 3.92, p = .05, \u03b72 = 0.032. \nThere was no relation between age and gender, F < 1, n.s., and no interaction. Verbal \nability scores for the two nationality groups were found to have acceptable homogeneity \nof variance, Levene\u2019s F(1, 119) = 3.14, n.s., and were therefore treated as a single \nvariable. A 2 (nationality) \u00d7 2 (gender) ANOVA with verbal ability as the dependent \nvariable showed no differences between nationality groups, F < 1, n.s., or gender groups, \nF(1, 117) = 2.65, n.s., and no interaction. Age and verbal ability were positively \ncorrelated, r(119) = 0.20, p < .05, two-tailed, r2 = .041, a relation that appeared due to a \npositive association between these variables in the Saudi sample, r(61) = 0.29, p < .05, \ntwo-tailed, r2 = .086, but not the British sample, r(56) = 0.07, n.s.. In the analyses that \nfollow, the general strategy was to include age and verbal ability as covariates.  \nVerbal Mediation     27 \n Before further analysis, the association between PS measures and age was \nexplored. As noted in the Introduction, the observation that PS peaks in middle childhood \nand then drops away means that it can be difficult to determine the developmental \nsignificance of instances where children do not use any PS. Children who produce no \nsuch utterances may be doing so because they have not yet begun to engage in PS, or \nalternatively because they have already completed the internalization process described \nby Vygotsky. In the absence of longitudinal data on PS use in our sample, our strategy \nwas first to examine correlations between PS use and age, in order to determine where \nour participants lay on the inverse-U curve of PS development. Because of violations of \nnormality in the untransformed data (see below), these correlations were computed using \nKendall\u2019s tau. As expected, correlations with age shifted from negative to positive with \nprogress through the developmental hierarchy of PS sub-types postulated by Berk (1986). \nThat is, age was significantly negatively correlated with PS1 rates, \u03c4(119) = -0.17, p < \n.025, uncorrelated with PS2 rates, \u03c4(119) = 0.09, n.s., and significantly positively \ncorrelated with PS3 rates, \u03c4(119) = 0.29, p < .001 (all tests two-tailed). Inspection of \nscattergrams showed these relations to be linear. It was therefore concluded that the \npresent sample was on the up-slope of the inverted-U trajectory described by previous PS \nresearchers, and that the process of internalization was still in progress for the children in \nthis sample. These findings are in line with those of Winsler and Naglieri (2003), who \nreported that use of covert PS (corresponding to PS3 in the present study) increased \nlinearly between ages 4 and 8, while use of overt PS (corresponding to PS2 in the present \nstudy) decreased over the same time period.  \nVerbal Mediation     28 \n As Table 1 shows, the speech measures derived from the ToL task had high \nstandard deviations relative to means (cf. Berk & Garvin, 1984), and analysis showed \nunsatisfactory skewness and kurtosis. Accordingly, all speech measures were log-\ntransformed before further analysis, reducing skewness and kurtosis to acceptable levels. \nAcross both nationality samples, 58 children (47.9%; 27 Saudi) produced no PS2, and 19 \n(15.7%; 12 Saudi) produced no PS3. In order to preserve statistical power after log-\ntransformation, these two sub-types were collapsed together to give a single rate measure \nof task-relevant, self-regulatory PS (PS2 + PS3). Only 12 children (9.9% of the sample; 7 \nSaudi) produced no such speech on the ToL task as a whole. Log-transformed self-\nregulatory PS was positively correlated with age, r(107) = 0.36, p < .001, r2 = .13, verbal \nability, r(107) = 0.25, p < .01, r2 = .063, and rate of social speech, r(107) = 0.73, p < \n.001, r2 = .53. Higher levels of PS were associated with older children and with those \nwho were more verbally able. The very strong correlation with social speech mirrors \nprevious findings with this task (Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005), and suggests that \nchildren\u2019s PS rates might relate to their overall talkativeness. Self-regulatory PS was \nsignificantly negatively correlated with log-transformed time spent on the task, r(105) = -\n0.52, p < .001, r2 = .27 (all tests two-tailed), when age and verbal ability were partialled \nout. Thus, children who used more PS solved the four trials of the ToL task more quickly, \nlending support to the idea that self-regulatory PS can enhance children\u2019s performance on \nthis task (Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005).  \nCross-National Comparisons of Private Speech Use \n Our first hypothesis stated that there would be cross-national equivalence in PS \nuse, and our second hypothesis entailed the prediction of an interaction between \nVerbal Mediation     29 \nnationality and gender, with Saudi boys producing less self-regulatory PS than Saudi girls \nor children in the UK. Relations with nationality and gender were investigated using \nanalyses of covariance, with self-regulatory PS as the dependent variable, and age and \nverbal ability as covariates. Both of these variables had been shown to be positively \ncorrelated with self-regulatory PS, and a further reason for controlling for age was that \nthe Saudi children were slightly older than their British counterparts (see above). A 2 \n(nationality) \u00d7 2 (gender) ANCOVA showed no main effects of nationality or gender, Fs \n< 1, n.s., but a significant interaction, F(1, 103) = 7.48, p < .01, \u03b72 = 0.068. The \ninteraction was investigated using separate one-way ANCOVAs on the two nationality \ngroups, with self-regulatory PS as the dependent variable, gender as the independent \nvariable, and age and verbal ability as covariates. A Bonferroni adjustment to alpha (\u03b1 = \n0.025) was made to allow for multiple comparisons. For the British sample, gender had a \nsignificant effect on PS rates, F(1, 49) = 8.63, p = .005, \u03b72 = 0.15, with boys producing \nmore self-regulatory PS than girls. For the Saudi sample, there was no statistically \nsignificant effect of gender, although there was a non-significant trend in the opposite \ndirection to the British sample, with Saudi girls using more self-regulatory PS than Saudi \nboys, F(1, 52) = 1.23, n.s., \u03b72 = 0.023. The cause of the interaction would therefore \nappear to be boys\u2019 greater use of self-regulatory PS in the British sample, coupled with \nno such gender effect in the Saudi sample.  \n As reported above, levels of self-regulatory PS in this sample were highly \ncorrelated with social speech. In order to determine whether the interaction between \nnationality and gender was specific to PS or applied to children\u2019s speech in general, the \nsame analyses were conducted on social speech measures. A 2 (nationality) \u00d7 2 (gender) \nVerbal Mediation     30 \nANCOVA with log-transformed social speech as the dependent variable showed no main \neffects of nationality or gender, Fs < 1, n.s., but a significant interaction, F(1, 114) = \n7.54, p < .01, \u03b72 = 0.062. As before, the interaction was investigated using separate one-\nway ANCOVAs on the two nationality groups, with social speech as the dependent \nvariable, gender as the independent variable, age and verbal ability as covariates, and a \nBonferroni adjustment to alpha (\u03b1 = 0.025). For the British sample, gender had no \nsignificant effect on social speech rates, F(1, 54) = 3.87, p = .054, although there was a \nmedium-sized effect (\u03b72 = 0.067) in the direction of higher social speech rates among \nboys. For the Saudi sample, there was a marginally significant effect of gender, F(1, 58) \n= 4.67, p = .035, \u03b72 = 0.075, with girls producing slightly more social speech than boys.  \n This pattern of findings for private and social speech therefore suggests that the \ninteraction between nationality and gender might apply to children\u2019s speech in general, \nrather than to PS in particular. In order to investigate this further, the two-way ANCOVA \nwith self-regulatory PS as the dependent variable was repeated with a further covariate \nincluded, namely the log-transformed rate of social speech. The result was that the \nNationality \u00d7 Gender interaction disappeared, F < 1, n.s., but now the main effect of \ngender was marginally significant, F(1, 102) = 3.94, p = .05, \u03b72 = 0.037, with boys using \nmore PS than girls across both nationality samples. This gender effect represents a small \neffect according to Cohen\u2019s (1988) criteria. The disappearance of the interaction with the \ninclusion of social speech as a covariate suggests that, when overall verbosity is taken \ninto account, the greater tendency of boys to engage in self-regulatory PS applies across \nnationality groups. This pattern of findings is considered further in the Discussion.  \nVerbal Mediation     31 \nCross-National Comparisons in the Shift to Phonological Recoding \nThe second main aim of the present study was to investigate cross-national \nstability in the shift to phonological recoding. First, the association between recall scores \nand the two background variables was investigated. As expected, the two memory scores, \nPDI and PSI, were strongly associated, r(119) = 0.76, p < .001, r2 = .58. Recall of PDI \nand PSI items was also significantly positively correlated with age, r(119) = 0.55, p < \n.001, r2 = .30, and r(119) = 0.61, p < .001, r2 = .37, respectively, and with verbal ability, \nr(119) = 0.32, p < .001, r2 = .10, and r(119) = 0.35, p < .001, r2 = .12, respectively (all \ntests two-tailed). Given that the Saudi children were marginally significantly older, it was \nnecessary to determine whether memory scores and age were related in both nationality \ngroups. For the Saudi group, recall of PDI and PSI items was significantly positively \ncorrelated with age, r(61) = 0.66, p < .001, r2 = .43, and r(61) = 0.74, p < .001, r2 = .54, \nrespectively. For the British group, recall of PDI and PSI items was also significantly \npositively correlated with age, r(56) = 0.43, p = .001, r2 = .18, and r(56) = 0.48, p < .001, \nr2 = .23, respectively. Cross-national comparison of these correlation coefficients showed \nthat memory scores and age were more strongly correlated in the Saudi sample than in \nthe British sample (for PDI, z = 1.82, p < .05; for PSI, z = 2.26, p < .05).  \nOur third hypothesis was that there would be cross-national stability in the use of \nphonological recoding, as indexed by susceptibility to the PSE. In the terms of the present \nstudy, any cross-national differences in such susceptibility would be demonstrated by an \ninteraction between nationality and phonological similarity. Our fourth hypothesis \nentailed the prediction that nationality, gender, and phonological similarity would \ninteract, with Saudi boys being less susceptible to the PSE than children in the other \nVerbal Mediation     32 \ngroups. These hypotheses were tested with a 2 (nationality) \u00d7 2 (gender) \u00d7 2 \n(phonological similarity) mixed-design ANOVA with recall score as the dependent \nvariable. There was a main effect of phonological similarity, F(1, 117) = 30.70, p < .001, \n\u03b72 = 0.21, with PDI items recalled better than PSI. There was a main effect of nationality, \nF(1, 117) = 4.33, p < .05, \u03b72 = 0.036, with Saudi children scoring more highly on the \nrecall task. There were no other main effects or interactions. In order to determine \nwhether the nationality effect resulted from the fact that the Saudi sample were slightly \nolder (see above), the analysis was rerun as an ANCOVA, with age and verbal ability as \ncovariates. In this case the main effect of nationality disappeared, F(1, 115) = 1.46, n.s., \nas did the main effect of phonological similarity, F(1, 115) = 1.15, n.s., although both \nremained as small (Cohen, 1988) non-significant effects, \u03b72 = 0.013 and \u03b72 = 0.01 \nrespectively. (Note that these main effects also disappeared when age and verbal ability \nwere entered as separate single covariates on separate ANCOVAs, suggesting that neither \ncovariate was predominantly responsible for the diminution of either of these effects.)  \nThe present study therefore demonstrated some support for our third hypothesis, \nwhich predicted cross-national stability in the shift to phonological recoding. Although \nSaudi children performed better on the recall tasks overall, this effect disappeared when \nage and verbal ability were included as covariates, suggesting that the nationality effect \nmay have been an artifact of the Saudi children\u2019s greater age. There was no interaction \nbetween nationality and phonological similarity, suggesting that neither nationality group \nwas more susceptible to the PSE. There was no support for our fourth hypothesis, which \npredicted a three-way interaction between nationality, gender and phonological \nsimilarity. \nVerbal Mediation     33 \nThe present study provided a further opportunity to test previous hypotheses \nabout the emergence of the PSE. As noted in the Introduction, there has been some \ncontroversy over the timetable for the shift to phonological recoding of visually presented \nmaterial, particularly regarding the question of whether the PSE obtains in children under \nage 6 (Ford & Silber, 1994; Palmer, 2000a). Given that a large proportion (38.8%; N = \n47; 20 Saudi) of our sample were under the age of 72 months, we were able directly to \nexamine cross-national stability in the shift to phonological recoding in this younger sub-\nsample. To preserve statistical power, gender (which had not had any main effect in the \nlarger sample) was not included as a variable in this analysis. A 2 (nationality) \u00d7 2 \n(phonological similarity) mixed-design ANOVA with recall score as the dependent \nvariable showed a main effect of phonological similarity on recall scores, F(1, 45) = 6.82, \np < .05, \u03b72 = 0.13, with PDI items recalled better than PSI. There was no main effect of \nnationality, F < 1, n.s., and no interaction. As before, the analysis was rerun as an \nANCOVA with age and verbal ability as covariates. Once again, the main effect of \nsimilarity disappeared, F < 1, n.s, \u03b72 = 0.00. There was no main effect of nationality, F < \n1, n.s., \u03b72 = 0.00, and no interaction. Power to detect the PSE in this sub-sample, based \non an effect size of \u03b72 = 0.13 for the PDI\u2013PSI difference, was estimated to be 97%.  \nThe present study thus provides evidence that susceptibility to phonological \nsimilarity, and hence presumably the beginning of phonological recoding, appears before \nthe age of 6. However, this effect may not be independent of individual differences in age \nand verbal ability, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the PSE when these variables \nwere included as covariates. \nVerbal Mediation     34 \nPrivate Speech and Phonological Recoding: Evidence for a Transition to Verbal \nMediation \nThe third main aim of the present study was to investigate relations between PS \nuse and phonological recoding. As suggested in the Introduction, empirical support for an \nacross-the-board transition toward verbal mediation would come from evidence of a \npositive correlation between (a) use of verbal mediation on a non-memory task and (b) \nphonological recoding of visually presented material. As outlined in the Method, PDI \nscores were taken as a measure of phonological recoding, when PSI scores were \nsimultaneously controlled for in a regression analysis. Hierarchical multiple regressions \nwere constructed as follows. In the first series of analyses, PDI scores were used as the \ndependent variable, representing the memory capacity resulting from the employment of \nphonological recoding in addition to visual coding (see Figure 1). On the first block, the \nbackground variables of nationality, gender, age, and verbal ability were entered. On the \nsecond block, PSI scores were entered, as a measure of memory ability based on purely \nvisual coding. Finally, on the third block, log-transformed self-regulatory PS was entered. \nIn order to test specificity, the analysis was then re-run using PSI as the dependent \nvariable, and entering PDI on the second block. If the target variable (self-regulatory PS) \nwere indeed a predictor of PDI when PSI is held constant, then its inclusion should \naccount for significant extra variance in the first model, but not in the second.  \nTable 2 shows the results of the first of these analyses. Neither nationality nor \ngender emerged as predictors of PDI recall on the first step. As expected from the \nexploratory correlational analyses (see above), age, verbal ability and PSI scores were \nstrong predictors of PDI recall. Table 2 demonstrates that the inclusion of self-regulatory \nVerbal Mediation     35 \nPS on the third step added significantly to the variance accounted for by the model, \u2206R2 = \n.02, p < .05. The same pattern was not found, however, when PSI was the dependent \nvariable and PDI entered on the second step (Table 3). The value of self-regulatory PS as \na predictor, therefore, seems to be specific to PDI scores, rather than to recall \nperformance in general. Table 4 shows the result of the hierarchical regression analysis \nwith the same variables, when log-transformed social speech rates were entered on the \nthird step instead of PS. Including social speech on the third step did not add to the \nvariance accounted for by the model, suggesting that any association between speech and \nmemory performance is specific to self-regulatory PS, rather than to speech in general.  \n Thus, in support of our fifth hypothesis, use of self-regulatory PS was associated \nwith recall of PDI items when PSI scores were held constant in a hierarchical regression. \nThis finding suggests that children who used higher levels of self-regulatory PS on a non-\nmemory task engaged in more phonological recoding of visually presented material. The \nfact that nationality did not make any independent contribution to the variance in PDI \nscores suggests that this relation between self-regulatory PS and phonological recoding is \ncross-culturally stable. \nDiscussion \nThe aim of the study reported here was to present cross-national comparisons of \nchildren\u2019s PS use and phonological recoding, and to investigate relations between these \ntwo varieties of verbal mediation. Our first hypothesis was that there would be cross-\nnational equivalence in PS use, with no effect of nationality on the rate of self-regulatory \nPS. This prediction was borne out. In our second hypothesis, we predicted that nationality \nwould interact with gender in ways reflecting the differing treatment of boys and girls in \nVerbal Mediation     36 \nSaudi society. Previous findings from Saudi Arabia and other collectivist cultures led us \nto predict that Saudi boys would have relatively limited opportunities for active \nparticipation in reciprocal exchanges with adults. On the basis of this assumption, Saudi \nboys were predicted to use less self-regulatory PS than their female compatriots and \nBritish children of both genders. The prediction of an interaction between nationality and \ngender was supported. Contrary to our hypothesis, the cause of this interaction was a \ngreater use of self-regulatory PS among British boys compared with British girls, coupled \nwith a non-significant trend in the opposite direction for the Saudi sample. A similar \npattern of findings emerged when social speech was used as the dependent variable, \nleading us to repeat the analysis of PS scores with social speech entered as a further \ncovariate. The result was that the interaction between nationality and gender disappeared, \nto be replaced by a marginally significant main effect of gender, with boys using more \nself-regulatory PS than girls across both nationality groups. This finding suggests a small \nunderlying gender effect in PS use when social speech is controlled for in analyses of \ncovariance. \nOur third hypothesis was that there would be cross-national stability in \nsusceptibility to the PSE, with the shift to phonological recoding occurring at the same \nrate in both nationality groups. In support of this hypothesis, there was no interaction \nbetween nationality and phonological similarity when recall score was the dependent \nvariable. Our fourth hypothesis predicted a three-way interaction between nationality, \ngender, and phonological similarity, with Saudi boys proving less susceptible to the PSE \nthan Saudi girls and British children. No such interaction was observed. For the group as \na whole, PDI items were recalled better than PSI items. There was a main effect of \nVerbal Mediation     37 \nnationality, with Saudi children scoring more highly on the recall task. However, both of \nthese main effects disappeared when age and verbal ability were entered as covariates. \nThe disappearance of the nationality effect was consistent with the Saudi children being \nmarginally significantly older than the British participants. The unexpected disappearance \nof the phonological similarity effect is considered in more detail below.  \n Our final hypothesis concerned the association between PS use and phonological \nrecoding. We predicted that children\u2019s use of PS would be a significant predictor of PDI \nrecall scores, when PSI scores were controlled for in hierarchical regressions. In line with \nthese predictions, self-regulatory PS accounted for a significant amount of extra variance \nwhen entered after background variables and PSI scores. Testing for the specificity of this \neffect, by switching PSI and PDI in a second hierarchical regression, suggested that the \neffect was specific to PDI recall rather than to recall in general. A final regression \nanalysis showed that social speech did not contribute significantly to the model, leading \nus to conclude that it is self-regulatory PS in particular, rather than speech in general, that \nis related to the use of phonological recoding.  \n A number of other findings are worthy of note. Firstly, our results add to a \ngrowing body of evidence that PS is a very common, almost universal phenomenon in \nearly and middle childhood. The vast majority of our participants (> 90%) used self-\nregulatory PS on the ToL task. These high levels of PS are in line with recent findings \nthat almost all children engage in PS (Matuga, 2003; Winsler et al., 2003). Secondly, \nchildren who used more self-regulatory PS solved the 4 trials of the ToL task more \nquickly. This finding corroborates recent evidence of an association between self-\nregulatory PS and concurrent task performance on both this (Fernyhough & Fradley, \nVerbal Mediation     38 \n2005) and other (Winsler et al., 1999) cognitive tasks. Our findings therefore add to a \ngrowing body of evidence that self-regulatory private speech can enhance children\u2019s \ncognitive performance in a range of contexts. Thirdly, our results speak to the issue of the \nage at which children begin phonological recoding of visually presented material. \nAnalysis of the recall data from a subset of children aged below 6 showed evidence for \nthe PSE, in terms of a significant difference between PDI and PSI recall. These results \nsuggest that phonological recoding may already be well established in the preschool \nyears. As with the analysis for the complete sample, this similarity effect disappeared \nwhen age and verbal ability were entered as covariates, an unexpected result that is \nconsidered in more detail below.  \nSeveral of the findings reported here warrant further discussion. The similarity of \nthe pattern of main effects and interactions in the analysis of PS and social speech is \nconsistent with the fact that PS was highly correlated with social speech, as would be \nexpected if PS has its ontogenetic roots in social speech (Furrow, 1984; Vygotsky, \n1934\/1987). When social speech was included as a covariate in a further analysis of the \nPS scores, the interaction between nationality and gender was replaced by a marginally \nsignificant main effect of gender. If social speech can be taken as a measure of \ntalkativeness that is not specifically concerned with self-regulation, we can conclude that \nthe two nationality groups\u2019 PS profiles became more similar when overall verbosity was \ncontrolled for. The appearance of an underlying gender effect is particularly interesting in \nthis regard, not least because it seems to be specific to self-regulatory PS rather than to \nverbosity in general. One possible cause of this gender effect might have been the \npresence of an unfamiliar male experimenter, which might be expected to make girls of \nVerbal Mediation     39 \nboth nationalities more inhibited in their speech (both social and private). This \nexplanation seems unlikely, however, given the relatively high rates of both kinds of \nspeech shown by the Saudi girls (see Table 1).  \nA more plausible explanation is that the greater use of self-regulatory PS by \nBritish boys reflects the different ways language is used by boys and girls in western \ncultures. Although the evidence points to no extensive gender differences in child\u2013parent \ninteraction in such cultures (Lytton & Romney, 1991), recent research has reported \nreliable gender differences in children\u2019s use of speech for different communicative \npurposes. In their meta-analysis, Leaper and Smith (2004) showed that, while girls in \ntheir representative studies were more talkative overall, boys used more self-assertive \nspeech (concerned with giving commands and influencing others), while girls used more \naffiliative speech (concerned with establishing and maintaining connections with others). \nGiven Vygotsky\u2019s (1934\/1987) claim that self-regulatory private speech represents the \nturning inwards, onto the self, of verbal directives that were previously used to regulate \nthe behavior of others, it is perhaps not surprising that, on a task involving considerable \ncognitive challenge, boys\u2019 greater use of directive speech acts is manifested in a gender \neffect in self-regulatory PS use.  \nOur findings may have implications for the rather equivocal body of evidence on \nPS and gender. Specifically, underlying gender differences in self-regulatory PS may \nbecome apparent when overall verbosity is controlled for, a precaution that is not \ncommonly taken in PS research. If this gender effect is confirmed by future studies on \nwestern samples, it would seem to go against our assumption that equivalence in child\u2013\nadult interaction in children of both sexes will be reflected in equal rates of PS in boys \nVerbal Mediation     40 \nand girls. One interesting avenue for future research is to determine whether boys\u2019 greater \nuse of verbal directives to the self on cognitive tasks is mirrored by girls\u2019 increased use of \nself-directed affiliative speech acts such as emotion expression and self-encouragement.  \nAs noted above, the present findings indicate cross-national stability in the shift to \nphonological recoding, along with evidence that phonological recoding is in place before \nchildren reach the age of 6. One surprising feature of our findings, however, is that the \nmain effect of phonological similarity on recall scores disappeared when age and verbal \nability were included as covariates, an analytical step that is not commonly taken in \ndevelopmental research on phonological recoding. At first glance, this finding might be \ntaken to weaken the case that the PSE is present in our sample. Alternatively, it may be \nthat certain aspects of our methodology served to reduce the strength of the PSE when \nthese covariates were included. One possibility is that our prohibition on overt labelling \nat presentation may have generally reduced children\u2019s phonological recoding. A second \npossibility is that the labelling prohibition may have introduced other task demands, not \nspecifically related to memory. For example, children below the age of about 5 find it \ndifficult to obey a \u2018do not speak\u2019 command (Luria, 1966). Future studies might address \nboth of these issues by including a comparison between overt labelling and enforced \nsilence at presentation. In the meantime, it is worth noting that children\u2019s performance on \nthe recall task was good, with means ranging between about 45 and 50 out of a total \npossible of 60 in each condition. This is consistent with Palmer\u2019s (2000a) finding of no \neffect of overt labelling on children\u2019s recall of pictures of any type. Also, the original \nrationale for prohibiting labelling was to avoid the possible confound of individual \ndifferences in children\u2019s tendency spontaneously to name items aloud. For example, more \nVerbal Mediation     41 \nimpulsive children might have been more likely overtly to name any pictorial stimulus \nplaced in front of them, which may in turn have influenced their use of phonological \nrecoding. \n Perhaps the most intriguing finding of the study reported here is the relation \nbetween children\u2019s use of self-regulatory PS and their tendency to use phonological \nrecoding, as indexed by their recall of PDI items when PSI performance was held \nconstant in regression analyses. These findings are consistent with the early insights of \nFlavell et al. (1966) on the link between domain-general verbal self-regulation and \nmemory performance. Flavell et al. reported that teachers accurately predicted those \nchildren who would rely on subvocal rehearsal in the memory task on the basis of their \nuse of language to regulate their behavior during everyday classroom activities. Our \nstudy extended this finding by taking objective measures of children\u2019s use of PS during a \nseparate, non-memory cognitive task. Generally speaking, the assumption that the shift to \nverbal mediation represents an across-the-board transition is supported by findings that \nindividual differences in PS are stable over time and across task contexts (Winsler et al., \n2003). Children who use verbal mediation in one context, such as a cognitive task with a \nhigh executive component, are therefore likely to be the same children who use it in a \ndifferent context, such as a memory task. Taken together, our findings represent evidence \nthat self-regulatory PS and phonological recoding are instances of a domain-general shift \nto verbal mediation in the preschool years.  \nThis possibility has received relatively little attention in previous work on \nworking memory development. Although some researchers have made reference to the \ninternalization of speech in accounting for the shift to phonological recoding (Ford & \nVerbal Mediation     42 \nSilber, 1994; Hitch et al., 1991), none has fully recognized the significance of PS as an \nempirically observable intermediary in this process. On the contrary, a Vygotskian \ninternalization account of children\u2019s phonological recoding has been explicitly rejected \nby some researchers. Drawing on the fact that children process language from the earliest \ndays of life, and thus must be depending upon the pre-existence of some underlying \nphonological processing capacity, Hitch et al. (1991) argued that the development of a \nsuch a capacity could not itself be the result of a gradual process of internalizing overt \nspeech. However, the fact that the articulatory loop is a necessary prerequisite of \nlanguage development does not preclude the possibility that children\u2019s internalization of \nspeech can influence their changing strategies for how they deploy their pre-existing \nphonological processing capacities. What is at issue is not how the articulatory loop is \nformed, but how it is recruited to help the child cope with constantly changing cognitive \nchallenges. Adopting a Vygotskian position on verbal mediation development does not \ntherefore have to entail that internalization actually forms the phonological short-term \nmemory system.  \n A further potential problem for the Vygotskian account of the development of \nphonological recoding concerns the presence of the PSE in anarthric (Bishop & Robson, \n1989) and deaf (Conrad, 1971) children. Hitch et al. (1991) suggest that children who \nhave never been able to hear speech (in the case of deaf children) or produce it (in the \ncase of anarthric children) will not have had the opportunity to internalize speech in the \nVygotskian sense. What remains to be determined is the extent to which the children in \nthese studies were able to rely upon sign systems other than natural language to mediate \ntheir behavior. For example, deaf children have been observed to engage in apparently \nVerbal Mediation     43 \nself-regulatory dialogues with themselves using sign language (Goldin-Meadow, 1999). \nDetermining the extent to which anarthric and deaf children can mediate their behavior \nusing sign systems other than natural language suggests a promising avenue for future \nresearch.  \n Related to this is the possibility that the direction of causation has been \nincorrectly described. That is, it may be that the internalization of PS and the \ncorresponding shift to verbal mediation is driven by, rather than is a determinant of, \nchanges in memory capacity and strategy. One reason for assuming the direction of \ncausation followed here is that PS appears well before any evidence for phonological \nrecoding (e.g., Furrow, 1984). That said, it is inconceivable that the process of \ninternalization could be unaffected by maturational changes in processing capacity. \nAgain, what is at issue is not the memory resources available, but the manner in which \nthey are recruited by the child to the retention and recall of information. Future research \nwill benefit from a closer examination of how maturational changes in processing \ncapacity interact with the emergence and internalization of PS and the development of \nphonological recoding.  \n Another issue for future research concerns how the onset of phonological \nrecoding augments pre-existing capacities for visuospatial encoding of pictorial \ninformation. Palmer (2000a) presents evidence that, instead of phonological strategies \nimmediately replacing visuospatial ones, children\u2019s recall is underpinned by a period of \ndual coding when both visuospatial and phonological resources are employed in parallel. \nOne way of determining more precisely the balance between visual and phonological \nstrategies would be to investigate children\u2019s susceptibility to the visual similarity effect. \nVerbal Mediation     44 \nIn addition, the use of suppression tasks selectively to interfere with these components of \nworking memory may allow us to understand better the roles of visuospatial and \nphonological coding in both memory tasks and cognitive tasks in general. Future research \nmight also examine children\u2019s developing understanding of their own mnemonic \nstrategies (Palmer 2000a), as has been done in recent studies of children\u2019s awareness of \ntheir self-regulatory PS (e.g., Winsler & Naglieri, 2003). More generally, replication of \nthe present study with a larger sample would allow us to gather richer data on the \ntimescale of the shift to verbal mediation, by including age as an independent variable in \nage-group comparisons.  \n Any such study will do well to consider these forms of cognitive activity within a \nsociocultural context. One limitation of the present study is that we were unable to obtain \ndirect measures of the interactional variables that we assumed, on the basis of previous \nfindings, to differ between our two nationality groups. Generally speaking, there is a need \nfor more cross-cultural work in the area of interpersonal interaction within families and \nlarger social groups. For example, it would be useful to know whether our assumptions \nabout the social opportunities available to Saudi boys and girls, based in part on evidence \nfrom other collectivistic cultures, are borne out by observational and interview data. Only \nsuch careful documenting of family and institutional interactional contexts will allow us \nto pay full attention to the sociocultural context within which PS and verbal mediation \ndevelop.  \n  Finally, it may be useful to note that the present findings provide a link between \ntwo important conceptions of the phenomenon of inner speech. On the one hand, there is \nthe Vygotskian notion of inner speech as the end-product of the gradual internalization of \nVerbal Mediation     45 \nsocial and private speech. On the other hand, there is the conception of inner speech as \nthe \u201cvoice in the head\u201d (Baddeley, 1986) that underpins our capacity to operate with \nphonological material in working memory tasks, speech planning, reading, and so on. We \nsuggest that these two kinds of inner speech may be the same thing. If this suggestion is \ncorrect, the inner speech that mediates many of our most important cognitive processes \nmay turn out to be influenced by similar social and cultural variables to those that have \nbeen shown to affect its external precursor, private speech.  \nVerbal Mediation     46 \nReferences \nAlbers, H.
