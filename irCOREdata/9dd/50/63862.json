An accurate \ndetermination of beach thickness is necessary in order to gain a better understanding of beach \nsediment transport processes and budgets.  Research into beach thickness has been limited, however, \nand clear quantifiable sediment volumes are not available for many sections of coastline.  The \nstability of the coastline is dependant upon its geological context, sediment regime, energy \nenvironment (wave, tide, and wind conditions), and the altitude at which this energy is delivered (sea \nlevel), together with any secondary effects resulting from human interference.  Sediments stored at \nthe shoreline in the form of beaches perform an important function in protecting the backshore or \nhinterland from erosion.  As a consequence, potential changes in forcing conditions resulting from \nfuture climate change are likely to have significant implications for the open coastline (Futurecoast \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 2 - 17\/06\/2008 \n2002).  Sea level rise, storm surge activity and wave climate are of particular importance.  The past \nevolution of open-coast beaches has involved gradual retreat in response to rising sea levels.  Those \ncoastlines composed of soft easily erodible materials, such as the Holderness coast of eastern \nEngland, have retreated rapidly.  In the future, it is anticipated that the rates of recession of \nundefended shorelines are likely to accelerate due to rising sea levels and possible increases in \nstorminess.  Easington is of regional significance, as much data has been gathered at the site in \nrecent years that can provide useful information on the development of beaches on till platforms, \nsuch as those found along the Holderness coast as well as other sections of the eastern England \ncoastline. \nShore platforms formed of relatively non-resistant till are sensitive to climate change. It is probable \nthat resulting changes in wave climate will promote an increase in the rate of platform \nerosion\/lowering.  A reduction in energy dissipation due to increasing water depths over the platform \ncould arise from an accelerated sea-level rise. This is likely to increase the wave energy reaching the \nbeach, thereby increasing erosion potential.  Also, if the direction of wave approach alters, then the \npattern of wave refraction over the platform may alter, leading to migration of wave and erosion foci \nalong coast (Futurecoast, 2002). \nCoastal sites present difficult surveying conditions, including regular tidal flooding and difficult \nground conditions, which limit vehicular access to survey sites.  The ground conditions change with \neach cycle of tidal flooding causing changes in ground surface level and the distribution of seawater \nwithin mixed beach sediments.  In some cases, site delineation using georeferenced pegs and floats \nthat are positioned on a regular basis is required such that all geophysical and geotechnical datasets \ncan be successfully spatially correlated.  Rapid, relatively inexpensive, portable site investigation \ntechniques are essential at sites that are only exposed for a few hours.  When using techniques that \nare sensitive to seawater saturation, such as electrical resistivity and electromagnetic techniques, it is \nuseful to independently map the level of the seawater within the beach and incorporate this \ninformation into the interpretation. \nMany geophysical and geotechnical properties are directly related to mineralogy and the relative \nproportions of solid grains, air and moisture within the sediment, (Buchan et al. 1972; Baker 1991; \nHight et al. 1997; Gunn et al. 2003).  Thus, changes in moisture content and the shape, orientation \nand packing of the grains all exert significant control on the in situ properties of deposits, and are \nthemselves controlled by the dominant coastal processes at a beach site.  Key to a successful \ninvestigation is an understanding of the sedimentology of the beach environment such that the \ncontrast in the properties between the base of the beach and the underlying platform can be \ncharacterised. For example, this allows some standard geophysical survey parameters, such as \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 3 - 17\/06\/2008 \npenetration, spatial resolution and contrast in properties to be addressed (Telford et al. 1976; \nParasnis 1980), and a suitable suite of geophysical surveys planned for beach thickness \ncharacterisation.  Some physical properties of geotechnical significance can be estimated using \ngeophysical methods (McDowell et al. 2002); for example, relationships between elastic moduli and \nseismic wave velocities have been discussed by McCann et al. (1986), Butcher & Powell (1996) and \nGordon et al. (1996).  Shear modulus is controlled by the interaction between neighbouring grains or \ncrystals within the solid framework of the soil or rock (Laughton 1957; Buchan et al. 1972; Stoll \n1977; Gunn et al. 2003).  These interactions are particularly influenced by the grain size range and \npacking density in beach sediments.  Thus, survey methods combining portable cone penetration and \nshear wave velocity based techniques are well suited to investigations at coastal sites. \nThis paper provides a case history detailing the information gathered and the subsequent geophysical \nsurveys used to assess the thickness of a beach site on the Holderness coast at Easington, East Riding \nof Yorkshire.  The study is used to discuss the scope and limitations of individual techniques.  Use of \nnewly emerging geographic information systems (GIS) to aid interpretation is demonstrated, \nparticularly when combining techniques to improve confidence in survey results.  Results have \nshown that this beach environment is highly variable and cannot be simply modelled as a low \nconductivity, low strength, low stiffness layer overlying a stiffer, higher conductivity bedrock with \nhigher strength. \n \nCoastline at Easington \n \nEasington is situated towards the southern end of the Holderness coastline (Fig. 1).  It is a cliffed \ncoastline composed of glacial tills, extending from Bridlington in the north to Kilnsea in the south, a \nfew kilometres to the south of Easington.  Sand and gravel-sized sediment generally travels south \nalong the coast as littoral drift, or, in the case of the fine-grained sediments, as suspended sediment \nin the nearshore zone (Motyka & Brampton, 1993).  The physical characteristics of the present-day \nbeach deposits along the Holderness coast vary considerably over fairly short distances.  The \ncomposition of the beach at Easington is intimately linked with the available sources of sediment, \nand as such is characteristic of a typical mixed-sediment, medium- to high-energy beach.  The beach \nprofile is relatively unstable, as indicated by the frequent marked changes in the position of the high \ntide mark.  This instability is also manifest in the presence of dynamic bars and troughs in the \nintertidal beach zone. \nGeology of the cliffs and sub-beach \nThe geology of the cliffs on the Holderness coast consists dominantly of relatively weak glacial tills \nwhich are subject to failure as the result of small landslides triggered by marine erosion and sub-\nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 4 - 17\/06\/2008 \naerial terrestrial processes (Futurecoast, 2002).  Glacial tills also form the subtidal shoreface along \nthe majority of the coast.  The sediment supply from the eroding cliffs is very high and is matched \nby erosion from the shoreface.  The cliffs along with the shoreface provide the main source of \nsediment within the system; hence the majority of sediment on this frontage is generated locally.  \nSand and gravel-sized sediment from the coastal recession forms important beach building material \nalong this coastline.  Historically, despite the release of beach-building sediment from cliff erosion, \nthroughout this frontage foreshore steepening or beach translation rather than accreting beaches have \naccompanied the trend of cliff retreat.  This has been the case over the last 100 years (Futurecoast \n2002).  Cliff top recession rates are variable along the Holderness coast both spatially and temporally \nbut there is a general increase in rate from north to south reflecting greater exposure to wave activity.  \nLong-term average rates measured over the last 150 years at Easington are extreme. Individual \nlandslide events may result in recession exceeding 10 metres over periods ranging from days to \nweeks (Futurecoast, 2002).  The cliffs and sub-beach platform within the study area at Easington \nconsists of tills of the Holderness Formation (Bowen, 1999). Examples of sections of the tills along \nthe Holderness coastline are provided by Madgett & Catt (1978), Butcher (1991) and Berridge & \nPattison (1994). In boreholes on the foreshore Catt & Digby (1988) recorded the same lithology \ncomprising the Basement Till extending down to the upper surface of the Chalk situated at \napproximately -27m OD.  The Basement Till is composed of a highly consolidated, stiff, very dark \ngrey (Munsell Colour Chart 5Y 3\/1) to dark greyish brown (10YR 4\/2) matrix-supported diamicton \nthat reaches a maximum observed thickness of 5m within cliff sections. The texture of the matrix is \ndominantly clayey sandy silt with occasional clasts of local and distant provenance. Some of the \nclasts, especially the limestones and ironstones, exhibit well-developed striations (including cross-\nsets) and streamlined keel morphologies, which are strongly diagnostic of abrasion and ploughing \nbeneath a glacier. Further evidence that supports a subglacial origin for the till is the presence of \nhighly deformed masses of attenuated chalk taking the form of attenuated laminae, boudinage, \naugens and small isoclinal fold noses. These structural features are characteristic of brittle and \nductile styles of deformation under moderate-high levels of shear strain within a subglacial \ndeformation till (Hart & Boulton, 1991; Benn & Evans, 1996). A striking feature of the till is that it \ndisplays a well-developed joint structure that dips sub-vertically\/vertically (81-90\u00b0) towards the \nnorthwest. This could purely be a function of weathering, or perhaps, more likely, that the Easington \narea was overridden by ice at a later date and the till compacted and dewatered. \nBeach morphology and sediment distribution \nThe beach at Easington comprises an upper high-tide beach (Komar 1976), composed of mixed sand \nand gravel, fronted by a predominantly sandy low-tide terrace (tidal flat), both of which are fully \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 5 - 17\/06\/2008 \nexposed at low tide.  The profile of the beach is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The low tide terrace \nconsists of a variable-depth veneer of mobile sand and some accumulated gravel, overlying a \ncohesive till platform.  The thickness of the sand on the terrace varies with changes in incident wave \nenergy, as does the thickness of the high tide beach.  The rising tide passes quickly over the low-tide \nterrace slope and serves to dissipate wave energy due to shallow water depths.  The high-tide beach \ngenerally consists of coarser-grained sediments than those on the terrace, thereby maintaining a \nsteeper profile.  Proximity to the cliff sediment source, and the concentration of wave energy for a \nlonger period of time during high tide, help to determine the difference in the sediment \ncharacteristics of the high and low tide beaches.  It is predominantly the characteristics of the high \ntide beach that are of interest to this study.   \nThe grain size of the high-tide beach surface at Easington varies down the profile (Figs. 1 and 2), \nwith fine to medium sand at the top near the base of the cliff around x=0m on the local survey grid, \ngrading to coarse sand and fine gravel on the lower beach face at around x=30m, and returning to \nfine to medium sand on the upper low-tide terrace at x=48m.  The mean grain size is greatest where \nenergy is focussed at the wave plunge point marking the break of slope between the high tide beach \nand the low-tide terrace, at approximately the position of the x=36m line on the survey grid.  The \ncomposition of the high-tide beach sediments also varies with depth.  In shore-normal cross-section, \nupper beach sediments typically show planar laminated, horizontal to seaward dipping sand \nlaminations, with steeper-gradient, coarser-grained, more discontinuous laminae in the lower \nforeshore (Short & Hesp, 1999), coincident with higher energy conditions around the plunge point.  \nAt Easington, a distinctive layer of medium-sized gravel is exposed at the base of the high-tide \nbeach (Fig. 1 & Plate 1), indicating that such a gravel layer exists between the underlying till \nplatform surface and the overlying mixed sand and gravel.  Investigation with a penetrometer at \nfixed points down the beach profile identified this horizon.  It is likely that this represents a gravel \nlag deposit that has been eroded from the underlying till before burial by the overlying beach \nsediments.  Similar, though discontinuous, lags of gravel also exist on the surface of the low-tide \nterrace, at locations where the sand cover is thin enough to expose the surface of the platform. \nAt the time of observation, during the surveys in July 2004, the distribution of high-tide beach \nsediments generally reflected degree of exposure to the prevailing wave climate, with coarse sands \nand gravels on the lower foreshore, and finer sands developing a berm on the upper foreshore \ntowards the base of the cliff (Plate 1).  The beach profile shows a characteristic berm at the top of the \nbeach at the upper swash limit of Mean High Water Springs, with a further mid-foreshore berm \naround the position of the Mean High Water strand line, (Fig. 2).  The beach profile was lowered by \nstorm activity during the week preceding the field campaign, but overall showed the typical \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 6 - 17\/06\/2008 \ncharacteristics of a sediment-filled \u201cswell\u201d profile.  In contrast, the veneer of sand covering the low \ntide terrace was thin, being of the order of only 10-15 centimetres thick at the interface between the \nhigh and low tide beaches.  Subsequent observation during October 2004, showed a much flatter \nbeach profile, and a more widespread distribution of gravel-sized sediments on the beach surface \n(Plate 2), with both high-tide beach berms having been removed, and a significant proportion of the \nsand redistributed to form a nearshore bar, with a corresponding greater thickness of sand across the \nlow tide terrace.  This is illustrated by a greater degree of burial of the tank defence blocks at the \nbase of the high-tide beach, and a less marked change in gradient between the high and low tide \nbeaches (shown by comparison of Plates 1 and 2).  At the top of the beach below the cliff face, there \nwas a significant change in beach level, of the order of 1-1.2m during this period. \nSurvey Techniques \nThe test site was located on the coast to the southwest of Easington village.  Access was via the \nSeaside Road that runs from the village to the beach.  A 48m x 24m survey grid was laid out as \nshown in Fig. 2, with its long axis running shore-normal.  Table 1 shows the range of geophysical \nproperties expected above and below the interface for the distribution of geological materials at site.  \nLithological characteristics of the beach materials at the time of the survey have been discussed \nabove.  Testing on samples of exposed till near the test site indicated the matrix to be a composite \nsoil type ranging from clayey sandy SILT to silty sandy CLAY, with a moisture content of 18%w\/w \nand a bulk density of 2.1Mgm-3; values that fall within the ranges provided by Bell (2002).  Seawater \nsaturation has a significant effect on some geophysical properties of the beach deposits, which must \nbe taken into account when interpreting the geophysical survey.  Therefore, it is useful to employ an \nindependent means of mapping seawater distribution such as the electrical resistance probe described \nbelow.  The whole site was only exposed for approximately two hours either side of the low tide \ntime, thus leaving only a four hour window for surveying.  Throughout exposure, a spring line was \nobserved to break from below a longshore zone of coarse gravel approximately equivalent to the \nx=36m plane, (see Figs 1 and 2).  Surveying times had to be short, thus favouring rapid, easily \ndeployable, portable techniques.  Where non-portable seismic refraction techniques were \nundertaken, survey lines had to be laid out rapidly and a portable shear wave source was required to \nensure relatively short survey times.  The surveys undertaken over this site included electrical \nresistivity tomography (ERT), electromagnetic (EM), shear wave velocity profiling using continuous \nsurface waves (CSW), positioning of the surface elevation with a global positioning system (GPS), \nshear wave refraction, cone penetration resistance profiling, radar reflection profiling, and saturation \nprofiling using an electrical resistance probe.  Fig. 2 indicates the position of each survey line and \nprofile location. \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 7 - 17\/06\/2008 \n \n Estimates of Geophysical Properties \n Un-saturated Deposits Saturated Deposits \n  Electrical Shear Pressure Electrical  Shear Pressure \n Density Resistivity Wave Wave Resistivity Density Wave Wave \nLithology   Velocity Velocity   Velocity Velocity \n (  Mgm-3 ) ( \u03a9.m ) ( ms-1 ) ( ms-1 ) ( \u03a9.m ) (  Mgm-3 ) ( ms-1 ) ( ms-1 ) \n  Properties of deposits above the interface \u2013 Beach Deposits   \nSand 1.9 10 - 10 000 80 - 200 400 - 600 3 \u2013 10 2.2 80 - 200 1600.0 \nMixed \nSand & \nGravel \n1.9 10 \u2013 10 000 150 - 250 400- 600 3 - 10 2.2 150 - 250 1700.0 \n  Properties of deposits below the interface - Bedrock   \nTill 2.3 10 - 40 300 - 500 1700-2000 10 - 40 2.3 300 - 500 1700-2000 \n \nTable 1.  Range of geophysical properties anticipated at site. \n \nShear Wave Refraction \nThe shear wave refraction survey exploits the critically refracted wave along the boundary between \nan upper layer of finite thickness and relatively low velocity and a lower layer presumed infinitely \nthick of substantially higher velocity.  Grainger et al. (1973), Telford et al. (1976), Parasnis (1980), \nPalmer (1981), Palmer (1986) and Lankston (1990) have provided explanations of field \nmethodologies.  Hammer blows forcing a railway sleeper to move along its axis, perpendicular to the \nseismic spread (Abbis 1981) generated horizontally polarised shear waves that were detected by a \nline of 24 horizontally polarised geophones, again orientated perpendicular to the seismic spread.  \nTable 2 provides typical arrival times for direct, non-critically refracted waves propagating through \nthe beach and the till platform.  A piezoelectric sensor on the sleeper was used to detect acceleration \ndue to movement and provide the trigger for event timing.  Coupling was greatly improved by using \nfins mounted on the underside of the sleeper that protruded into the formation to 0.1m.  Examples of \narrivals for longshore wave direction are shown in Fig. 3 where the Dry Sand Location was between \nx=0m and x=12m, the Wet Sand Location between x=24m and x=36m and the Till Platform Location \nseaward of x=48m on the grid in Fig. 2.  Different velocities at the two sand locations can be \nattributed to increased effective stress with depth resulting in faster shear waves at larger source-\nreceiver distances and the effect of water suction or increased packing density resulting in faster \nwaves at the wet location.  Refraction survey effectiveness increases with larger ratios between the \nbeach material and the underlying till, e.g. Kassenaar (1992) suggested ratios of at least 1.5, which \nare only satisfied over shorter source-receiver distances on dry sand locations.  In this case, there \nwas insufficient contrast between the shear wave velocities in the beach and the till platform for a \nsuccessful shear wave refraction survey. \n \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 8 - 17\/06\/2008 \n \nEasington Beach and Bedrock Shear Wave Velocity \n Velocity for Source to Receiver Distance \nMeasured on: 6m 12m 24m \nDry Sand Location 111ms-1 134ms-1 180ms-1 \nWet Sand Location 166ms-1 189ms-1 194ms-1 \nTill Platform Location 174ms-1 207ms-1 223ms-1 \n Velocity Contrast Sand : Till Ratio \nDry Sand Location 1:1.57  (64%) 1:1.54  (65%) 1:1.24  (81%) \nWet Sand Location 1:1.05  (95%) 1:1.10  (91%) 1:15  (87%) \n \nTable 2.  Typical measured velocities for non-critically refracted shear waves through the beach and \ntill platform. \n \nCone Penetration Resistance \nThe principle of the lightweight dynamic penetrometer is to drive a cone of known area into the \nground with blows from a standard hammer onto the head of a piston attached to the cone by a steel \nrod.  Commercial equipment is instrumented such that speed of impact and the penetration per blow \nare measured and used to calculate dynamic cone resistance using the Dutch formula (Langton \n1999).  The lightweight penetrometer is manually operated, which may cause variability in results.  \nHowever, using this equipment in a sequence of weathered and unweathered tills at a test site at \nCowden, Holderness (20km from the survey site) Langton (1999) produced comparable penetration \nresistance profiles to those described by Butcher et al. (1996), who employed motorised equipment \nand bentonite slurries to reduce friction effects.  The lightweight equipment employs a 16mm \ndiameter cone of 2cm2 area with 0.5m long, 14mm diameter extension rods for standard use.  Where \nthe till at the survey site was expected to be close to the surface, problems with side friction were \ncombated by using sacrificial cones of 22.5mm diameter and 4cm2 area, such as along the line of \nx=48m in Fig. 2.  Where sacrificial cones were not used the effects of side friction can usually be \nobserved as around a five-fold increase in penetration resistance over an interval of 0.5m.  Gravel \nlags at the base of the beach and changes in strength within the till are identified on the penetration \nresistance-depth profiles, Fig. 4.  For example, along x=36m, gravel lags are characterised by a series \nof peaks of approximately 20-30 MPa above local minima that represent the top of the till.  The cone \npushing against gravel-sized clasts before either breaking or pushing between them causes these \npeaks.  The top of the till is represented by a value of approximately 5 MPa at (36,0), (36, 12), (48,0) \nand (48,12) but only about half this value at (36,24) and (48,24) on the grid.  [N.B. co-ordinate \nlabelling, for example (36,0), on the figures is equivalent to (36m,0m) but does not include the m \ndimension for clarity].  An overall increase in undrained shear strength with depth in the till was \nimplied from the cone resistance profiles.  This is consistent with increased shear wave velocities as \nthe wave continually refracts more deeply into the formation as source-receiver distance increases. \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 9 - 17\/06\/2008 \n \nContinuous Surface Wave \nContinuous surface waves (CSW) are produced by a sinusoidal signal generated by an \nelectromagnetic vertical vibrator seated on the ground surface.  In practice, this produces a series of \nfinite duration pulses, each at a single frequency over a range of frequencies, for example from 5Hz \nto 100Hz in increments of 0.5Hz or 1Hz.  Field data acquisition at each frequency is synchronized \nwith the control to the vibrator and field dispersion curves are generated from the recorded signals at \ntwo or more receivers, aligned shore parallel, using a method based on the steady state Rayleigh \nmethod described by Viktorov (1967), Richart et al. (1970), Nazarian & Stokoe II (1984), S\u00e1nchez-\nSalinero (1987), Nazarian & Desai (1993), Joh (1996) and Foti (2000).  The incoming sea can affect \nsignal to noise levels, but the investigations were undertaken at low tide conditions when the sea was \nover 75m away, and field data were generally of very good quality.  The field data were inverted to \nproduce shear wave velocity profiles with depth using WinSASW 2.2.1 following the procedure \ndescribed by Joh (1996), with examples shown in Fig. 5.  The inversion is non-unique and the \nground properties as characterised by the cone penetration resistance profiles were used to aid the \nprocedure.  For example, gravel lags within the beach deposits often appear as intervals with high \npenetration resistance and also intervals of localised higher shear wave velocity as seen above 1m at \nlocations (0, 0) and (12, 24) and above 0.5m at (36, 12) in Fig. 5.  The CSW inversions provide shear \nwave velocity profiles that are very consistent with the velocities measured during the shear wave \nrefraction survey.  The upper three graphs (values of x<36m in Fig. 5) can be divided into three \ngeneral zones representing the upper 0.5m of beach of approximately 100ms-1, lower beach from \n0.5m to 2.0m of approximate velocity range from 100ms-1 to 200ms-1 and the underlying till bedrock \nof approximate velocity range from 200ms-1 to 300ms-1.  The profile at (24, 24) shows the influence \nof effective stress causing an increase in the shear wave velocity with depth to 1.5m in the beach \nsediment with apparently little gravel (on the basis of the cone resistance profile). The top of the till \nin the lower graphs (values of x>24m in Fig. 5) has velocities below 200ms-1 and relatively low cone \nresistances (Fig. 4), which could possibly be related to the till in these locations suffering greater \ndirect sub-aerial and sub-marine exposure time, particularly in winter months.   It is also possible \nthat this is representative of the heterogeneity of the till, with soft silty clay layers at the top of the \ntill in these locations.  The profile at (36, 12) also demonstrates how the top of the till would be a \nhidden layer and not be identified on a shear wave refraction survey.  \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 10 - 17\/06\/2008 \nElectrical Resistance Probe \nObservations of seawater drained from the beach producing spring lines around x=36m at low tide \nindicated that the groundwater levels at the site were controlled by the tidal fluctuations.  It is \nimportant that the depth of the groundwater table within the beach deposits is known when \ninterpreting electrical and electromagnetic survey data because saltwater saturation significantly \naffects the in situ electrical properties (see Table 1).  It is also important to have knowledge of the \ndepth interval of the partial saturation zone and the change in geophysical properties within this \nzone.  Probes utilising time domain reflectometry (Hook & Livingston 1996) or resistivity \nmeasurements (Jackson et al. 2002) can be deployed to independently assess seawater levels within \nthe beach.  Fig. 6 shows a schematic of the measuring head of a simple resistance probe that used a \nfour electrode technique (Telford et al. 1976, Parasnis 1980) to measure the electrical resistance of \nthe localised beach volume adjacent to the measuring head.  The current and voltage electrodes are \nonly 1mm in diameter and erroneously large resistivities can occur when large gravel-sized grains \ncontact the electrodes, as exemplified by the measurement shown in Fig. 6 at just below 2m at (0m, \n12m).  The beach at the site predominantly comprised well-draining, coarse materials giving rise to \nlarge magnitude resistance changes within a 0.1m interval from approximately 1000 \u03a9 above the \npartially saturated zone to approximately 30 \u03a9 at the seawater table, thus allowing it to be mapped.  \nThe groundwater level is dynamic, and the timing of the electrical resistance probings should take \naccount of the time and duration of the EM and ERT surveys with respect to low tide.  The example \nin Fig. 6 shows a suite of measurements made over the period of an hour, beginning at \napproximately 1hour before low tide, which was comparable to the timing of the EM and the ERT \nsurveys.   \nGround Penetrating Radar \nGround penetrating radar (GPR) uses a transmitting antenna to provide a short pulse of high \nfrequency (25 - 1000 MHz) electromagnetic energy into the ground.  Variations in the electrical \nimpedance within the ground generate reflections that are detected at the ground surface by the same \nor another antenna attached to a receiver unit (Davis and Annan, 1989; Reynolds, 1997).  Variations \nin electrical impedance are largely due to variations in the relative permittivity or dielectric constant \nof the ground, and thus respond well to water distribution and sedimentological structure (Neal \n2004).  Depth of penetration depends largely on factors such as the variability in the dielectric \nconstant within the ground, attenuation of the waves within materials, and the frequency of \noperation.  Davis & Annan (1989) and Neal (2004) provide tables of relevant properties.  For \nexample, water has a dielectric constant of 80, unsaturated sand and gravel around 5 and saturated \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 11 - 17\/06\/2008 \nsand and gravel around 16, and hence there are high reflection coefficients between dry and wet \nmaterials.  The electrical conductivity significantly affects the attenuation of radar waves, and on a \nbeach, seawater intrusion is a significant factor in the effectiveness of the GPR technique.  Surveys \nwere undertaken around the low tide such that the beach could drain to acceptable water levels. \nCommon-offset, single-fold reflection profiling was undertaken with a fixed antennae geometry \nmoved along a survey line to map reflections versus position.  Unshielded antennae were operated \nwith 2m spacing at a centre frequency of 50MHz resulting in wavelengths of up to 2 m.  Given the \nvariability of the materials at the site, generally conductivities were within the range from 0.001 to \n0.1Sm-1, equating to attenuations from around 1 to 300 dBm-1 (Neal 2004).  The radar section was \nbuilt up from successive traces that were recorded with the radar stationary at each point.  All radar \ntraces were accumulated by stacking traces in order to improve the signal to noise ratio.  Data were \ncollected over the local grid along profiles in the y direction (i.e. x constant profiles parallel to the \nshoreline).  The results are plotted in section form as two way travel time against traverse position.  \nA time to depth conversion has been applied to the data by adopting an estimated electromagnetic \npropagation velocity of 0.1 m ns-1.  Two profiles are shown in Fig. 7, that along x=0 was at the top of \nthe beach near the cliffs, whilst that along x=48 was on the low tide platform.  Along x=0m a distinct \nreflection is observed at a depth of approximately 2 m, i.e. the top of the till identified and consistent \nwith cone resistance profiles, (see Fig. 7a).  The sea level at the time of the survey (low tide) would \nhave been some 5 m below the top of the beach.  Perched water above till was confirmed to be of \nvery low thickness using the electrical resistance probe, discussed above.  Above this reflection, the \nsection is characterised by its lack of reflectivity and is interpreted as a unit of mixed sand and gravel \nof low moisture, which appears to thin towards y=24.  The survey along x=48 (Fig. 7b) is a section \nover the till as there was no significant sediment cover.  The strong reflector at about 0.5 m depth is \nconsidered to be the ground wave.  Structure within the till may have been imaged, appearing for \nexample, as sub-horizontal reflectors and gently dipping reflectors.  Variability in the radargram \nbeneath this reflector appears as either scattered chaotic reflectors from y=0 to y=12, translucent with \nweak reflectors from y=12 to y=20 or with strong reflectors to y=24m.  Unshielded antennae were \nused and it is suspected that side reflections from the concrete blocks (see Fig. 2 for positions) are \nresponsible for these features.  If where there are no blocks from y=16 to y=24, the persistent \nreflector just beneath the ground wave is due to heterogeneity within the upper part of the till, it is \nsuspected that this would be a near-surface layer with a high proportion of very coarse material, such \nas the cobble rich layers shown in Plate 3. \nEM Conductivity \nGround Conductivity surveys employ electromagnetic coil-coil coupling with different depths of \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 12 - 17\/06\/2008 \nexploration (McNeill, 1980).  The Easington beach survey was conducted across the local survey grid \nfrom (-2.5, 0) to (40, 24) using profiles (along the y-direction) spaced 2 m apart.  The instrument used \nhad a single transmitter orientated as a vertical dipole and two receivers housed in a boom around 4m \nlong.  The nearest receiver was at 4m from the transmitter orientated as a vertical dipole and the second \nreceiver was 4.1m from the transmitter orientated as a horizontal dipole.  This receiver configuration \nprovides two different depths of investigation of about 2.5 m (shallow) and 6 m (deep).  The boom was \noperated at slow walking pace, on a wheeled cart, recording coupling ratios every 0.5 seconds.  Data \nwere collected at both the shallow and deep depths of investigation.  This resulted in an along-profile \nsampling interval of about 0.3m.  The survey of the main site took about one hour to complete.  The \nout-of-phase coupling ratios, for each receiver, can be converted to apparent conductivity using \nstandard procedures (McNeill, 1980).  The data for each receiver may then be used to form maps of \napparent conductivity for two different depths of investigation (e.g. shallow and deep).  The \nconductivities are apparent since the conductivity is assumed not to vary with depth.  The data can, \nhowever, be treated in a more rigorous manner using an inversion scheme that attempts to recover the \ntrue variation of conductivity of depth at each measurement location.  Due to the limited information \nobtained, it is necessary to regularise the inversion and only smooth conductivity variations with depth \nare permitted.  It is also assumed that the conductivity variation is one-dimensional (1D).  The 1D \nmodels obtained are stitched together to form a volumetric assessment of the conductivity distribution \nbelow the survey region.  The conductivity model is shown in Fig. 8 as a 3D perspective view draped \nbelow topography.  The volume size is 42.5m x 24m x 7.5m and the view is along the local y-direction \nparallel to the cliff (on the left) and sea (on the right).  The conductivity range observed is far greater \nthan that encountered in normal geological circumstances due primarily to saline invasion of the beach \nwhere the highest conductivities (> 500 mS\/m) are defined in a thin at-surface zone between x=20 and \n36m.  Another zone of elevated conductivities is related to structure within the till, has a strong \nalignment with the cliff\/beach axis and appears either as a lens that dips in a seaward direction, or as \ntwo shallow beachward dipping layers of higher conductivity separated by a lower conductivity layer, \nas discussed in the Thickness Interpretation and Discussion sections below. \nElectrical Resistivity Tomography \nElectrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a method by which spatial models (2D or 3D) of subsurface \nresistivity distributions are generated.  In the case of the beach environment it was anticipated that ERT \ncould be used to image resistivity variations associated with changes in the lithology and the water \ncontent of beach materials.  ERT data were collected from two survey lines (Fig. 2).  The first line \n(ERT-1), with a strike perpendicular to the shoreline, comprised 64 electrode positions at 1 m intervals, \nand extended from (\u20135, 12) to (58, 12).  The second line (ERT-2), which was oriented parallel to the \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 13 - 17\/06\/2008 \nshoreline, comprised 32 electrode positions at 1 m intervals, and extended from (21, -3) to (12, 28).  \nThe two lines intersected at (12, 12).  The resistivity data were collected using an 8-channel resistivity \nimaging system, and a dipole-dipole array configuration with \u2018a\u2019 spacings of 1, 2, and 3 m and \u2018n-\nlevels\u2019 of 1 to 8.  The survey was designed to achieve a maximum depth of investigation of \napproximately 6 m below ground level.  The ERT-1 dataset consisted of 811 measurements that took 18 \nminutes to collect, whilst the ERT-2 dataset included 299 measurements that were collected within 5 \nminutes.  Data acquisition was carried out shortly before low tide (1437 hours) at between 1230 and \n1400 hours on 20th July 2004; throughout the ERT survey the till platform was exposed in drainage \ngullies on the lower foreshore seaward of the concrete blocks (Fig. 2). \nThe data were inverted using a 2D smoothness constrained nonlinear least-squares algorithm (Loke and \nBarker, 1995).  The forward problem was solved using a finite element method, which permits \ntopography to be easily incorporated into the inversion process (Tong and Yang, 1990).  In this case, \ngood convergence between the observed and model data was achieved, as indicated by RMS errors for \nmodels ERT-1 and ERT-2 of 1.05 and 1.54 % respectively.  The 2D models resulting from the \ninversion process are shown in Fig. 9.  Model resistivities ranged from less than 1 \u03a9m to 160 \u03a9m \n(equivalent to 1000mS\/m to 6.25mS\/m), reflecting significant variations in the beach materials.  As \nanticipated, the ERT-2 model, which runs parallel to the shoreline, shows only limited lateral changes \nin resistivity, whilst ERT-1 displays significant lateral variations reflecting changing beach composition \nfrom the base of the cliff to the till platform.  Distinct layering can be seen in both the ERT models.  In \nthe area of the high-tide beach a resistive surface layer (>50 \u03a9m or <20mS\/m conductivity) overlies a \nhighly conductive zone (<5 \u03a9m or >200mS\/m conductivity), which in turn gives way to more resistive \nmaterials at the base of the models (5 to 50 \u03a9m).  Although this sequence is reproduced in both ERT-1 \nand ERT-2, the base of the conductive zone falls at a slightly greater depth in ERT-2.  This small \ndiscrepancy is likely to be a function of decreasing model resolution with depth, and off-line 3D effects \n(e.g. Chambers et al., 2002).  The distribution of resistive surface materials, which thin and disappear \ntowards the low-tide beach, corresponds well to that which would be expected from the unsaturated \nsands and gravel of the high tide beach.  The conductive zone extends across the full length of ERT-1, \nalthough it thins markedly from several metres at the high-tide beach to tens of centimetres on the till \nplatform.  The low resistivities of this material indicate saturation by saline water; this assertion is \nsupported by electrical resistance probe measurements (Fig. 6), which also indicate a change from \nunsaturated to saturated conditions at the same points.  Given the absence of substantial sand cover on \nthe till platform it is likely that this zone represents both saturated sands and gravel and weathered till.  \nThe moderate resistivities of the materials comprising the bottom layer of models are consistent with \nunweathered till bedrock. \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 14 - 17\/06\/2008 \n  \nThickness Interpretation \nMatching in situ geology with consistent data from a number of geophysical and geotechnical \ndatasets improves confidence in the geophysical ground model.  Newly emerging IT packages such \nas Rockworks2004TM or GSI-3D (Hinze et al. 1999; Sobisch 2000) provide very powerful platforms \nto store, present and aid interpretation of geological and geophysical data.  When gathering large \nquantities of field data it is recommended that survey planning includes sufficient time for the \nintegration of all geological, geotechnical and geophysical data in a well-considered phase of \ninterpretation that includes the use of 3D modelling and display software.  The field data gathered at \nthe Easington site has been integrated using Rockworks2004TM to illustrate key features.  Surface \ntopography, as provided by a GPS survey, is vital for the sub-surface positioning of all data.  It \nshould be noted that beach surface topography is dynamic and should be surveyed regularly.  The \nexample in Fig. 9a shows the ERT-1 2D section with topography and the level of groundwater table \nat the time of survey; the groundwater table was confirmed by the electrical resistance probe \nprofiles, which transects the sharp boundary between the wedge of high resistivity unsaturated beach \nand the saturated zone below.  Note again the spring line at around x=36m, where seaward of this \npoint the beach is saturated and appears as the shallow surface high conductivity zone in Fig. 8b. \nThe till surface, as shown in Fig 9, is based on an integrated interpretation of all the relevant field \ndata.  In the west near the cliff, the top of the till is coincident with the groundwater table level and \nthus strong reflectors on the radargram and the boundary between high and low resistivity zones.  \nHowever, seaward, between x=6m and x=36m the top of the till transects this resistivity boundary, \nsuggesting that in places the top of the till has similar resistivities to saturated beached deposits.  \nThis was confirmed with 0.5m Wenner surveys in the saturated beach and on the till platform.  Here \nthe top of the till is interpreted on the basis of the cone penetration and continuous surface wave \ndata, for example where it is coincident with shear wave velocities of 200ms-1 or greater and low \npenetration resistances around 5MPa, which rapidly increase within a 0.5m interval.  The resistivity \nand conductivity data show layering within the till, where a higher resistivity layer within the till \nunderlies a gravel lag at the base of the beach at around 36m.  Figure 10 shows the emergence of the \ntill layer at between x=36 and x=40m as higher resistivity or lower conductivity.  Note that \nconductivity colour table has been reversed (i.e. hot to cold) such that low conductivities show as \nyellows and reds.  Figures 10 shows that this higher resistivity layer within the till coincides with \nhigher penetration resistances and high shear wave velocities suggesting that it is stiffer and more \ncompact than the till above.  Using the GIS, a model of a mixed sand and gravel beach has been \n                                                 \nTM Registered trademark of Rockware Inc. \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 15 - 17\/06\/2008 \ndeveloped that includes unsaturated mixed sand and gravel in the upper high tide beach of \napproximately 2m thick, which thins over a terrace slope around 24m long to a thickness of around \n0.4m, and continues to thin to less than 200mm over a low tide beach that forms a veneer over the \ntill platform.  The platform is of variable strength and stiffness and appears to be layered with a soft, \nhigh conductivity layer overlying a stiffer low conductivity layer. \nDiscussion of Methodologies at Coastal Sites \nSurvey activity at coastal sites should be undertaken in a modular fashion to maximize the \ninformation gained at each site during successive phases of surveying, with each additional survey \nbuilding upon the previous phase.  A methodology is required that ensures that the decision to use a \nparticular technique is correctly made because supporting field evidence was available.  Thus, \nsurvey efficiency can be significantly improved if certain key activities are undertaken within a field \nprocedure in the correct order.  Prior to choosing techniques with which to survey a site, there are \nsome fundamental factors that need to established: \nStep 1. Establish the lithologies of the deposit (sand\/gravel etc) and the bedrock if possible. \nStep 2. Establish the degree of water saturation in the deposit and its variability with tidal cycles. \nStep 3. Establish a contrast in the geophysical\/geotechnical properties of the deposit and the \nbedrock. \nStep 4. Establish that the geophysical\/geotechnical contrast is laterally continuous. \nStep 1 can be achieved by observation of a suitably qualified geologist.  In practical terms this \nrequires a literature review and reconnoitring visits by a field geologist with relevant experience, and \nthereafter a report of their findings to the survey crews.  Step 2 can be achieved using a simple probe \nthat either directly measures moisture content or a moisture content proxy, for example an electrical \nresistance probe.  Step 3 can be achieved using probes to gauge geophysical properties of the beach \nand bedrock.  For example, shear wave probes have been used to verify the shear wave velocities in \nthe sand materials and the Mercia Mudstone bedrock at a sand and gravel quarry in Nottingham \n(Gunn et al. 2005).  Such tools would be used in conjunction with the lightweight cone penetrometer \ntool.  Cone penetration profiling should be undertaken at a series of point locations, for example, \nalong the intended line of a seismic refraction survey.  The resulting penetration resistance profiles \ncan be examined to identify potential stiffness interfaces that could be interpreted as the top-bedrock \nboundary.  These data would provide evidence to decide whether or not to use follow-up surface \nwave and seismic refraction surveys.  The identification of a step-like increase in cone penetration \nresistance on a single profile provides sufficient evidence to justify a continuous surface wave \nprofile at that location.  Step 4 is achieved with the identification of similar features on a line of \npenetration profiles, thus providing evidence that the feature is laterally continuous and justifies a \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 16 - 17\/06\/2008 \nshear wave refraction survey.  These steps can be translated into a survey methodology such as the \nfollowing example.  Proposed here is a two-stage methodology that includes a more detailed \nreconnoitring visit that involves several prescribed activities that can feed into a plan for the final \nsite survey. \nReconnoitring Visit: In addition to standard procedures (tides, access, amenities) the reconnoitring \nsite visit should also include the following activities: \ni. Participation of an experienced field geologist who subsequently reports their \nfindings. \nii. Cone resistance and moisture content profiling at key locations at the site including \nthe bedrock if exposed. \niii. Other geophysical property probing (e.g. shear waves) at key site locations. \niv. The collection of samples for further examination and laboratory tests. \nSurvey Plan: These primary data can be considered when establishing a survey plan for each site.  \nThis will involve a choice from a \u2018toolbox\u2019 of techniques.  Such a plan could include: \ni. Use of ground penetrating radar in coarse well-drained deposits, where it is \nestablished that seawater saturation will not present problems. \nii. Continuous surface wave (CSW) profiling where potential stiffness interfaces have \nbeen identified (inferred) using the penetrometer. \niii. Shear wave refraction where potential continuous refractors have been identified \nusing CSW, or inferred along a line of penetrometer profiles. \niv. More detailed surveys using electromagnetic (Dual EM and EM38) or electrical \nresistivity imaging, and further exploration of newly developed equipment where \nappropriate and available. \n \nFinally, it is anticipated that climate change will include rising sea levels and changes in wave \ndirection that will change the pattern of coastal erosion.  DEFRA\u2019s concern with the future \ndevelopment of the UK coastline in response to climate change is the theme of new projects \nfollowing on from Futurecoast (DEFRA 2002), where an understanding of the long-term dynamic \nnature of coastal processes causing coastal erosion is advised.  Such strategic programmes should \ninclude studies of the processes and rates of current soft cliff recession and the role of the platform in \ncoastline evolution.  New methods should include rapid scanning of cliff elevations and beach \nsurfaces using combined surveying and laser techniques as discussed by Hobbs et al. (2002), where \ncombined geophysical-geotechnical methods can be used to establish the thickness of beach \nsediment. \nAcknowledgements \nThis article is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British Geological \nSurvey (NERC). \nDavid Gunn An evaluation of combined geophysical and geotechnical methods to characterise beach thickness \n \n - 17 - 17\/06\/2008 \n \nReferences \nAbbiss, C.P.
