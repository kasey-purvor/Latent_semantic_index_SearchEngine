It typically extends several Earth radii out from the\nEarth\u2019s surface along the magnetic equator, and the plasmaspheric density ex-\ntends along the Earth\u2019s dipole field lines toward the magnetic poles. Recently,\nthe Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV) on the Imager for Magnetopause-to-\nAurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft has been able to image the\nultraviolet emission of plasmaspheric helium (Sandel et al., 2001). Ideally, one\nwould hope to use these images to extract a map of magnetospheric density. So\nfar, such a task has been difficult. Difficulties relate to the relation of emission\nto local density, the line of sight integration of the emission, lack of emission at\nlow density, and uncertainties about the field line distribution of density and\nthe relative density of various plasma species. Here, we generate a computer\nmodel for the magnetospheric electron density and mass density at 29 August\n2000, 1519 UT, by supplementing the EUV data with in-situ electron den-\nsity measurements at earlier and later times (Bauer and Stone, 1968; Benson\net al., 2004), and with mass density values inferred from field line resonance\nfrequencies measured by magnetometers on the Earth\u2019s surface (Menk et al.,\n1999).\nThe mass density controls the rate of response of the magnetosphere to inter-\nnal or external perturbations. The purpose of this particular study is to derive\na realistic mass density model to study the propagation of fast\/magnetosonic\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves through the plasmasphere and the resonance\nproperties of these waves within the plasmaspheric cavity. (The waves may\nresonate within the plasmasphere much like sound waves resonate in a mu-\nsical instrument.) A previous study using a two dimensional model of the\nplasmasphere found that the plasmaspheric cavity resonance could account\nEmail address: richard.e.denton@dartmouth.edu (R.E. Denton).\n2\nFig. 1. (a) EUV instrument image of resonantly scattered solar EUV photons\n(30.4-nm) at 29 August 2000 1519 UT. (b) Simulated EUV instrument image using\nthe model for electron density developed in this paper.\nfor the observed ultra low frequency (ULF) frequencies of Pi-2 oscillations of\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field (Denton et al., 2002). However, this study did not\naddress the effects of a realistic three dimensional density model on the waves.\nThe density model described in this paper has been derived for the purpose\nof investigating these waves, but such a model can be used in many other dy-\nnamical studies. The model could also be useful for calibrating IMAGE EUV\ndensity inversion schemes. Furthermore, this study also sheds new light on the\ndistribution of magnetospheric density in certain regions, such as in the dusk\nplasmatrough and plume.\n2 Development of the Model\n2.1 EUV Image\nThe IMAGE EUV instrument images solar EUV photons at 30.4-nm wave-\nlength that are resonantly scattered by singly ionized helium in the plasmas-\nphere (Sandel et al., 2001). The 30.4-nm feature is relatively easy to measure\nbecause it is the brightest ion emission from the plasmasphere, it is spectrally\nisolated, and the background at that wavelength is negligible. The plasmas-\npheric He+ emission is optically thin, so its brightness is directly proportional\nto the He+ column abundance. Full images are taken with at least 10 min\nresolution.\nFigure 1a shows the plasmaspheric image taken at 29 August 2000 1519 UT.\nThe Sun is off the plot in the direction of the upper left corner; on the lower\n3\nright side of the plot there is darker emission due to the Earth\u2019s shadow. The\nimage is a composite from three cameras; this is the cause of the horizontal\ndiscontinuities in brightness. There is significant sunlight contamination on\nthe left side of the plot, particularly for the middle camera. Much of the field\nof view of the upper camera is shielded to avoid damage to the camera. The\nincreasing brightness toward the center of the image corresponds to higher\ndensity in the plasmasphere. The brightest (horseshoe shaped) ring comes\nfrom emission close to the surface of the Earth. (This emission is actually a\ncombination of He+ emission other than 30.4-nm and O+ emission that is\nso bright that it is detected by EUV (Bill Sandel, private communication,\n2004).) Considerable structure in the shape of the plasmasphere is evident;\nnote particularly the plasma plume (or tail) at the bottom of the plot and\ncurving around toward the left side of the plot.\n2.2 Plasmapause Position\nThe plasmapause is the outer boundary of the high density plasmasphere. At\nthe plasmapause, the density falls off steeply. The region outside the plasmas-\nphere is called the plasmatrough. In Figure 1a, there is an irregular boundary\nwhere the 30.4-nm emission falls off sharply. Goldstein et al. (2003) calls this\nthe \u201cHe+ edge\u201d, and shows that this visual feature corresponds to the location\nof the plasmapause (sudden drop in electron density). This drop in bright emis-\nsion may and often does cross the EUV instrument threshold \u223c 40\u00b1 10cm\u22123.\nThe asterisks in Figure 2 show the plasmapause determined using the method\nof Goldstein et al. (2003). The image of Figure 1a has now been rotated into\nSolar Magnetic (SM) coordinates, with X in the direction of the Sun (toward\nthe left of the plot), and Y in an eastward direction (toward the bottom of\nthe plot). Thus the Sun is to the left in Figure 2. The half illuminated circle\nat the center of the plot shows the location of the Earth. The location of the\nplasmapause at local noon (facing the Sun) is not indicated by asterisks in\nFigure 2 because the corresponding region of the image in Figure 1a is blacked\nout to protect the camera.\nThe solid curve in Figure 2 shows the location of the plasmapause used in\nthe model. The plasmasphere rotates with the Earth in a counterclockwise\ndirection (viewing the Earth from the north). At dawn local time (top side of\nFigure 2 ), the rotation of the plasmasphere is usually close to but somewhat\nfaster than the Earth\u2019s rotation, while at dusk (the bottom side of Figure 2),\nthe rotation is close to but somewhat slower (Wolf et al., 1995; Burch et al.,\n2004). Thus by looking at the plasmapause at dawn in earlier EUV instrument\nimages or at dusk in later ones, we can get an idea of the plasmapause structure\nat 1519 UT (time corresponding to Figure 1a) at local noon.

The asterisks show the plasmapause determined using the method of Goldstein\net al. (2003). The solid curve shows the plasmapause used in the model. The regions\nA, B, C, and D, lines a and b, and point 1 are discussed in Section 2.5.\nimages before and after 1519 UT, no large amount of structure was observed\nfor this region, so we connected the measured plasmapause positions at early\nmorning local time to that in at early afternoon local time with a roughly radial\nconnection. A slight bulge in the plasmapause was included at magnetic local\ntime MLT \u223c 10.7 to bring the plasmapause out to L = 3.2 at that local time\n(see discussion in Section 2.5). A smooth connection of the asterisks was also\nmade in the plasma plume.\n2.3 Electron Density in the Inner Plasmasphere\nThe IMAGE spacecraft has a meridional orbit (orbit over the poles). In 2000,\nits apogee was over the North pole, and that is where the image in Figure 1a\nwas taken. After 1519 UT, the spacecraft moved toward MLT \u223c 2.5 (post-\nmidnight) as it approached perigee at a height of 1.2 RE. It then passed over\nthe South pole and moved outward at MLT \u223c 13.7 (afternoon). Because of\nthis, IMAGE passed through the plasmasphere at two MLT values within 8\u201311\nhours UT after 1519 UT. Similarly, IMAGE passed through the plasmasphere\nat two different MLT values within 3\u20136 hours UT before 1519 UT.\nThe Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) instrument on IMAGE (Reinisch et al., 2000),\nwhen operated in its passive mode, measures emission which is associated with\nthe upper hybrid frequency, and the frequency of this emission can be used\n5\nn\ne0\n3( )cm\u2212\n(a) UT = 9.6\nMLT = 2.2 \n        -> 7.9\n(b) UT = 11.5\nMLT = 14.8 \n        -> 18.6\n(c) UT = 23.7\nMLT = 2.5 \n        -> 18.1\n(d) UT = 25.5\nMLT = 13.7 \n        -> 3.5\n(e)\nL\nFig. 3. (a-d) In-situ electron density ne versus L as measured by IMAGE RPI at\nuniversal times close to the values indicated in each panel. The two MLT values\ngiven in each panel in the format MLT1 \u2192 MLT2 are the MLT value where ne was\nmeasured (MLT1) and the mapped value of MLT assuming corotation (MLT2). (e)\nAll the measurements superposed.\n6\nto infer the local electron density ne (Bauer and Stone, 1968; Benson et al.,\n2004). These measurements of the local electron density determined before\nand after 1519 UT are shown in Figure 3a-d for the four UT and MLT values\nindicated in each panel. (Both the UT and MLT values are typical values\napproximating a range of values. Figures 3b and d plot the density values for\nconsecutive time values near spacecraft perigee where L first decreases, then\nincreases; that is why the L values are not monotonic.) The MLT values are\nshown in the format MLT1 \u2192 MLT2. The first value MLT1 is the local MLT\nwhere the measurements were taken, and MLT2 is the mapped value of MLT\nassuming corotation. For instance, the measurements of ne in Figure 3b were\nmeasured at 11.5 UT at MLT = 14.8. This is 3.8 hours UT earlier than 1519\n= 15.3 UT. Assuming then that the plasma observed in Figure 3b corotated\nwith the Earth from 11.5 to 15.3 (1519) UT, it would have moved from MLT\n= MLT1 = 14.8 to MLT = MLT2 = 14.8 + 3.8 = 18.6 by 1519 UT.\nThe data at all four times is superposed in Figure 3e. While there is a signif-\nicant variation in the low density values with ne < 40cm\n\u22123 (plasmatrough),\nthe high density values (plasmasphere) fit fairly well on the dashed line\nlog10(ne) = 5.25\u2212 0.82L. (1)\nWith a slight modification (described in the Section 2.4), we use Equation 1\nto describe ne within L = 3.2.\n2.4 MLT Dependence in the Inner Plasmasphere\nA code has been developed to invert the EUV instrument image and get\na \u201cpseudo-density\u201d of He+, nHe. Counts are first translated into integrated\ncolumn density using the SOLAR2000 solar flux model (Tobiska, 2000). The\nassumption is made that the plasmaspheric densities drop rapidly with L-shell\nand that the dominant contribution to image intensity in any single pixel\ncomes from that portion of the line of sight that passes within 0.1 L of the\nminimum L-shell. The length of that segment in the line of sight increases with\nincreasing L-shell for an observing location at high latitude and can result in\na bias toward larger L-shell of as much as a factor of three. Column density\nin cm\u22122 is converted to density in cm\u22123 by dividing by the length of that\nsegment of the line of sight.\nDensity structure is fairly well ordered by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which is\napproximately dipolar. In three dimensions, the density structures evident in\nthe equatorial plane (structures similar to, but not exactly the same as those\nshown in Figure 1a) drape up out of the equatorial plane along magnetic\nfield lines and turn down toward the poles. The calculation of pseudo-density\n7\nX R\nE\n( )\nY\n( )R\nE\nFig. 4. Grayscale plot of the log of the pseudo-density of He+, nHe, versus SM\ncoordinates X and Y using Figure 1a as an input.\ndoes not take into account overdraped field line content (high density at large\nL that because of the shape of the magnetic field drapes across the field of\nview looking toward a lower L in the equatorial plane). That means that\nlow pseudo-densities radially inward of a density enhancement (especially the\nplume) would be expected to be somewhat higher than the actual density.\nFigure 4 shows a greyscale plot of the log of the He+ pseudo-density nHe using\nFigure 1a as an input. Figure 5 shows the pseudo-density nHe versus L at four\ndifferent values of MLT, MLT = 18 (thin solid curve), 21 (thick solid curve),\n3 (small dashed curve), and 6 (large dashed curve). From the pseudo-density,\nwe can see several features of the plasmasphere, a steeply dropping density\nwithin the plasmasphere proper (i.e., within L \u2264 3), a drop to a much lower\ndensity at large L (except for MLT = 18), and the plasma plume (bump in\nthe thick solid curve at L \u223c 3.8).\nIdeally, we would just use the density plotted in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and\nmultiply by the electron to He+ ion ratio to get the electron density. However,\nthe uncertainties in the method leading to Figure 4 are too great to follow that\nprocedure. If we assume a constant ne\/nHe ratio, the densities in Figure 4 are\nnot consistent with the data presented elsewhere. If we use the Craven et al.\n(1997) model for ne\/nHe, the disagreement is worse. (The data of Craven et al.\n(1997) has ne\/nHe increasing with respect to L. The pseudo-density slightly\ndecreasing with respect to L in the plasmatrough at most values of MLT in\nFigure 5 would imply that ne is increasing with respect to L, contrary, for\nthe most part, to the profiles for ne in Figure 3.) Because of this, we use a\n8\nLn\nHe \ncm\n\u2212( )3\n18\n21 3\nMLT = 6\nFig. 5. Pseudo-density of He+, nHe, versus L along four cuts, MLT = 18 (thin solid),\n21 (thick solid), 3 (small dashes), and 6 (large dashes).\nconstant ne\/nHe ratio in our model and we use the pseudo-density as a guide\nfor some limited aspects of the model.\nFirst we note that the density in the inner plasmasphere (L \u2264 3.2) has a\nsmall MLT dependence. The solid curves in Figure 5, representing density on\nthe duskside, are somewhat higher than the dashed curves, representing the\ndensity on the dawn side. We incorporate this into the model by modifying\nEquation 1 as follows:\nlog10(ne) = 5.25\u2212 0.82L+ 0.25(L\u2212 1.5) cos(2pi(MLT \u2212 18)\/24), (2)\nwhere MLT is given in hours. The second observation is that the density in\nthe plume (peak in the thick solid curve at L = 3.8 in Figure 5) is larger than\none would expect based on the dropoff in density up to about L = 3 (thick\nsolid curve at L \u2264 3). Because of this, our plasmasphere density decreases\nless strongly outside L = 3.2 (solid curve in Figure 3e). Further motivation\nfor the choice of the outer (L > 3.2) plasmaspheric density is presented in\nSections 2.5 and 3. Also, because of the problems understanding the ne\/nHe\nratio mentioned above (in this subsection), we assume that the average ion\nmass (ratio of mass density to electron density) is constant throughout the\nmagnetosphere.\n9\n2.5 Mass Density Based on Field Line Resonance Frequencies\nThe field line resonance mode is an azimuthally oscillating (toroidal) Alfven\nwave. The resonance frequency is particularly dependent on the mass density\nin the vicinity of the magnetic equator, where the magnetic field strength\nis a minimum (Denton and Gallagher, 2000). Given a realistic magnetic field\nmodel, the magnetospheric mass density in the vicinity of the magnetic equator\ncan be determined from field line resonance frequencies measured by magne-\ntometers on the Earth\u2019s surface. Here we use data from the SAMNET (Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network, http:\/\/www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/samnet\/,\nYeoman et al., 1990), IMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic\nEffects, http:\/\/sumppu.fmi.fi\/image\/, Luhr et al., 1998), BGS (British Geo-\nlogical Survey, data available from SAMNET) ground magnetometer arrays in\nEurope and Antarctica, and from the MEASURE (Magnetometers Along the\nEastern Seaboard for Undergraduate Research, http:\/\/measure.igpp.ucla.edu\/,\nBerube et al., 2003) ground magnetometer array. The resonant field line was\ndetermined using the cross phase technique with pairs of stations (Waters et\nal., 1991)). For each measurement, the T96 magnetic field model (Tsyganenko,\n1995) is used to map the ground station location to the equatorial plane where\nthe magnetic field is a minimum. The normalized frequency of the Alfven wave\nfundamental f\u00af1 \u2261 f1LRE\/VA\u2212Bmin is calculated using the dipole field model\n(as described by Denton and Gallagher (2000)), but for LRE = RBmin, where\nRBmin is the geocentric radius to the point on the field line where B is a\nminimum according to the T96 model, and VA\u2212Bmin is the Alfven speed at\nthat location. A perfect conductor boundary is assumed at a height of 400 km\nabove the ground, and \u03c1 is assumed to vary along field lines like R\u22120.5, where\nR is the geocentric radius. (The normalized frequency is not a strong function\nof L except at very low L \u2264 2; except for the point with RBmin = 1.9RE, for\nwhich f\u00af1 = 0.42, f\u00af1 is equal to 0.35 \u00b10.02 for all our data points.) Then the\nmass density at the magnetic equator is found from\n\u03c1 = (3.42Bminf\u00af1\/(GRBmin))\n2, (3)\nwhere Bmin and RBmin are found from the T96 model, and G is the ratio of the\ntotal length of the T96 field line to that of a dipole field line with LRE = RBmin\n(G is within 8% of unity for all our data points). Using the values of Bmin and\nRBmin from the T96 magnetic field in this way results in a more accurate\nestimate of \u03c1 than would be found from the dipole field model alone.\nFigure 6a shows mass density values inferred from field line resonance mode\nfrequencies at dusk local time, MLT \u223c 17.6 (asterisks, Scandinavian meridian)\nand 15.8 (diamonds, UK meridian). Figure 6b shows two inferred mass density\nvalues at morning local time, MLT \u223c 10.3 (asterisks, MEASURE).

The curves in the plots represent\nthe mass density from our model, where we have assumed an average ion mass\nof 1.4 amu throughout the magnetosphere. This factor gives rough agreement\nbetween the plasmaspheric mass density values at dawn (Figure 6b) and the\nRPI local electron density values (Section 2.3), as indicated by the agreement\nof the asterisks and solid curve in Figure 6b.\nBased on the mass density values in Figure 6a, we include in our model a\nregion of enhanced density concentrated in the dusk local time sector and\noutside the plasmasphere proper (outside L \u223c 2.5 at MLT = 18). Based on\nthe radial dependence in Figure 6a, we model this density as\nlog10(ne) = 3.75\u2212 0.43L. (4)\n11\nAs can be seen from Figure 6a, the density in this region falls off less steeply\nwith respect to L than does the density in the plasmasphere at L \u2264 2.4. Equa-\ntion 4 describes the density in region B of Figure 2. This density component\nalso contributes to the density in regions A, C, and D of Figure 2; however, in\nthese regions the density in Equation 4 is multiplied by a factor that decreases\nwith respect to the distance away from region B. As can be seen from Fig-\nure 1, the EUV emission from the region outside the plasmasphere in region\nB falls off in the other regions, particularly toward midnight local time. We\nchose a 1RE spatial scale for the falloff of the density toward midnight, and a\n5RE spatial scale for the falloff of the density toward noon. In region A, the\ndensity in Equation 4 is multiplied by exp(\u2212((18 \u2212MLT )\/5)2); in region C,\nthe density in Equation 4 is multiplied by exp(\u2212(X1 \u2212X)2), where X1 is the\nX coordinate of point 1 in Figure 2; and in region D, the density in Equation 4\nis multiplied by exp(\u2212((X1\u2212X)2+(Y1\u2212Y )2)), where Y1 is the Y coordinate\nof point 1 in Figure 2.\nFor the outer measurement at L \u223c 3.2 in Figure 6b, the phase relation between\nthe waves measured by the two ground magnetometer stations used (with the\ncross phase technique: see (Waters et al., 1991)) was reversed from the normal\nrelation, indicating that the L value might be within the plasmapause (Menk\net al., 1999). For this reason, we made the model plasmapause (Figure 2) bulge\nout slightly at MLT \u223c 10.3 to put that data point near the model plasmapause\n(Figure 6b). Note that we have no data from EUV at this local time.\n2.6 Floor on the Electron Density at Large L\nFigure 3e shows that there is a large variation in the electron density at large L\nin the region outside the plasmasphere. Values range from 1 to 20cm\u22123 at the\ntimes indicated in Figure 3e. The EUV image shows a significant amount of\nlight at large L in the original EUV image, indicating that the density at large\nLmay be a significant fraction of 40cm\u22123, the density typically associated with\nthe EUV plasmasphere threshold (Goldstein et al., 2003). Because of this, we\nput a floor (lower limit) on ne near the upper limit of the 1 to 20cm\n\u22123 range\nobserved by RPI (Figure 3e), (11\u00b1 4 cos(2pi(MLT \u2212 18)\/24))cm\u22123.\n2.7 Plasmapause Width\nFrom the EUV image (Figure 1a), it was apparent that the plasmapause was\nmore narrow at dawn than at dusk. We chose to allow a sinoidal variation of\nthe plasmapause width with respect to MLT. The maximum width is 0.4 RE\nat MLT = 17 hours, and the minimum width is 0.1 RE at MLT = 5 hours.\nWithin that width, the equatorial density varies linearly from the value in the\n12\nplasmasphere to the value outside the plasmasphere. (A median plasmapause\nwidth from Carpenter and Anderson (1992) is 0.1\u20130.2 RE.)\n2.8 Polar Cap\nOutside of L = 13 (based on the dipole field model), we assume that we are\nin the polar cap. (Our emphasis in this model is the plasmasphere rather than\nthe polar cap. A more accurate description of this region would require a more\naccurate magnetic field model.) Within the polar cap, we model the electron\ndensity using the formula given by Gallagher et al. (2000),\nlog10(ne) = \u22123.09 log10(h) + 13.5, (5)\nwhere h is the altitude in km and ne is the density in cm\u22123.\n2.9 Field Line Dependence\nFor the field line density variation, we used the model of Denton et al. (2002)\nbased on electron density measurements from the Polar spacecraft. Along the\nfield line, a power law dependence is assumed with respect to the geocentric\nradius,\nne = ne0 (LRE\/R)\n\u03b1 , (6)\nwhere ne0 is the equatorial electron density. The value of \u03b1 is given by\n\u03b1 = \u03b1model = 8.0\u2212 3.0 log10 ne0 + 0.28 (log10 ne0)2 \u2212 0.43L. (7)\nIf this formula led to \u03b1 < 0, we raised \u03b1 to zero. Also, motivated partly by the\nresults of Denton et al. (2004) (showing that the density at R \u223c 2RE often\nlevels off at large L to ne \u223c 100 cm\u22123) and partly by the fact that low density\nat low altitude can cause numerical problems in simulations, we imposed an\nadditional criterion on \u03b1. If the density at a radius of 2RE based on Equation 6\nwith Equation 7 is less than 100 cm\u22123, \u03b1 is increased so as to bring the density\nat R = 2RE up to 100 cm\n\u22123.\nCalculations of the field line dependence of mass density using field line reso-\nnance mode harmonics (Takahashi et al., 2004) indicate that \u03b1 might better\nbe modelled with a low value 0\u20131 throughout the (closed) magnetosphere. At\nthis time, we do not know whether Equation 7 or \u03b1 \u223c 0\u20131 better describes\n13\nX R\nE\n( )\nY\n( )R\nE\nFig. 7. Grayscale plot of the equatorial density as a function of SM coordinates X\nand Y .\nthe field line difference. The difference in the simulated EUV image based on\nour model (Figure 1b using Equation 7) is not great.\n3 Discussion\nOur goal has been the generation of a mass density model that is realistic\n(accurate within perhaps a factor of 2) in the regions where we have good in-\nformation about the density (plasmasphere proper and plasmatrough at dusk)\nand at least reasonable in the regions where our diagnostics are not so good\n(especially the outer plasmatrough). The first input to our model is the EUV\nimage of resonantly scattered solar EUV photons at 29 August 2000 1519 UT\n(Section 2.1, Figure 1a). This image provides the plasmapause boundary (Sec-\ntion 2.2, Figure 2) and some evidence regarding the MLT dependence of den-\nsity in the plasmasphere and density of the plume relative to the surrounding\nplasma (Section 2.4) and regarding the density in the plasmatrough at large\nL (Section 2.6). The local electron density measurements from IMAGE RPI\n(Section 2.3, Figure 3) provide the electron density in the plasmasphere proper\n(plasmasphere excluding the plume) as a function of L and some guidance con-\ncerning the electron density in the plasmatrough (Section 2.6). The inferred\nmass density values from the field line resonant mode provide the average\nion mass (assumed to be constant throughout the magnetosphere) and the\ndensity in the dusk region outside the plasmasphere (Section 2.5, Figure 6).\nFigure 7 shows the logarithm of the model equatorial density (either electron\n14\nor mass density, since the grayscale levels are uncalibrated) as a function of\nSM coordinates X and Y .\nFrom the equatorial density, we use the field line dependence model of Denton\net al. (2002) to generate a three dimensional model of magnetospheric electron\nand mass density. Using the model electron density as an input, a simulated\nEUV image is generated. The procedure is as follows. Line of sight vectors\nare calculated over a 151 by 151 grid of 0.6\u25e6 pixels using IMAGE orbit and\nattitude data for the epoch (an EUV image is roughly 85\u25e6 in a direction normal\nto the scan plane of the spacecraft and 360\u25e6 in the transverse direction, and\nhas pixels that are 0.6\u25e6 to a side), and then the pixel line of sight integrated\nHe+ 30.4-nm signal is estimated under the assumption of a constant ratio of\nHe+ to electrons. The numerical integration extends from the spacecraft out\nto L = 9 on the far side of Earth, excluding any part subtended by the Earth\u2019s\nshadow, and is simplified by the fact that although the volume of any voxel\n(three dimensional pixel) along the line of sight scales as r2, where r is the\ndistance to the voxel, the radiation collected by the sensor from that voxel falls\nas r\u22122. The electron density within a voxel is taken to be the model electron\ndensity at its center. The simulation assumes a perfect detector and, up to a\nscale factor, should be consistent with EUV images that have been processed\nto remove geometric distortions and the effects of spacecraft rotation, and\nhave been flat fielded and registered during ground processing.\nThe resulting image is shown in Figure 1b. Though presented last, the com-\nparison between Figure 1a (real EUV image) and Figure 1b (simulated EUV\nimage using our density model) provided additional input to the model. For\ninstance, based on the results from the simulated image the width of the plume\nwas decreased where there was some uncertainty about the exact location of\nthe outer edge, and the ratio of density in the plume relative to the slot region\njust inside the plume was increased. The general similarity of Figure 1a and\nFigure 1b provides support for the overall model.\n4 Acknowlegements\nWork at Dartmouth was supported by NSF grant ATM-0245664 and NASA\ngrant NAG5-11825.
