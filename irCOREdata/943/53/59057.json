This increasingly \npopular technique has obvious applications in environmental monitoring, civil and process \nengineering, waste management and the growing field of hydrogeophysical research. Recent \nexamples have included the monitoring of: \n\u2022 aquifers during tracer tests [3, 14, 20], \n\u2022 infiltration into the unsaturated zone [9], \n\u2022 coastal zones and saline intrusion [19, 23], \n\u2022 embankment dams [13, 21], levees and other geotechnical infrastructure, and \n\u2022 landfills [10, 11]. \n \nTraditionally, ERT monitoring is often carried out by means of manual repeat surveys, in \nwhich electrodes are installed temporarily for the duration of the measurements. The \npermanent installation of in-situ sensors along with the addition of telemetry have proven to \nbe particularly attractive as ERT data acquisition can thus be initiated, controlled and \nmanipulated remotely. This step has facilitated a significant evolution in methodology by \nenabling a high degree of automation for ERT data transfer, processing, management and \ninterpretation [7, 16, 19, 25]. The power of such an approach lies in the dramatic increase in \ntemporal resolution compared to both manual repeat surveys and manually controlled \npermanent installations, thus providing the potential for new insight into rapidly occurring \nsubsurface processes. We refer to this concept as automated time-lapse electrical resistivity \ntomography (ALERT) and have recently developed dedicated instrumentation, telemetry and \nIT infrastructure for its practical implementation. \n \nBetter hydrogeophysical characterisation is desirable for a wide range of complex and rapidly \noccurring subsurface processes, such as sharp variations in saturation levels or changes in \naquifer properties associated with groundwater movement, solute transport or contaminant \nmigration. An example of a highly complex process is leachate circulation in landfill sites, \nwhich involves rapid movement of fluids (multiphase flow) due to hydraulic forcing and \nsaturation changes caused by temperature\/pressure variations, hydrochemical alteration and \nlandfill gas generation. However, the acquisition of resistance data and ERT image generation \n 5 \ninvariably requires a finite amount of time, which affects image quality and imposes a limit \non the rates of change that can be captured with ALERT monitoring. A common fundamental \nrequirement for all rapid monitoring applications is the need to optimise the style of ERT data \nacquisition by balancing the complexity of measurement schemes (and hence the acquisition \ntime) against spatial and temporal accuracy and resolution. \n \nIn this paper, we present our implementation of the ALERT concept and discuss the results of \na recent study exploring the limiting conditions for successful monitoring of a series of \ngeneric controlled hydraulic experiments with cross-borehole ERT measurements. While a \nnumber of recent studies have focussed on hydrogeophysical aspects, aquifer transport \ncharacteristics and the quantification of ERT monitoring results in an attempt to derive \nhydraulic properties [14, 20], we concentrate here on the generic aspects of ERT monitoring \nand the necessary technology. ALERT instrumentation, telemetry, data management and \nprocessing workflow are described in the first part of the paper. The second part describes \nhow we have used specifically designed hydraulic test cells at reduced field scale to validate \nthe ALERT concept by emulating typical subsurface processes. These included (1) the \ntemporal evolution of water levels and surface infiltration into the unsaturated zone and (2) \nthe migration of fluids with anomalous electrical properties, for example as caused by \nadvancing pollution plumes or leachate recirculation in landfilled waste. The performance of \nALERT in different monitoring scenarios (2D\/3D plus time) was also assessed. \n2 The ALERT geophysical monitoring concept \nAt the heart of the ALERT monitoring concept is a core measurement system and data logger \nthat is capable of autonomously scheduling, collecting and storing time-lapse electrical \nimaging data. This instrumentation is installed at a remote site and links seamlessly with other \nALERT components that we have developed, including autonomous and environmentally \nfriendly power supply solutions, long-distance telemetry, a relational data management \nsystem, web delivery and deployment options that allow remote operation in a reliable and \nsecure manner. \n2.1 Instrumentation \nThe core ALERT measurement system implements the same functionality as manual multi-\nelectrode ERT survey equipment that is now widely available commercially. It supports a \nrange of geoelectrical measurement types, including resistance, induced polarisation, and self-\npotential across ten input channels. The system has been designed for battery operation (12 or \n24 V) and grid power, solar panel or wind turbine charging options are available for \n 6 \nautonomous operation in remote locations. Open system architecture allows for scalability \n(virtually any practical number of electrodes can be addressed via switching modules) and the \nintegration of alternative environmental sensor types (e.g. temperature, pressure, pH). User-\nadjustable acquisition parameters (e.g. duty cycle) and measurement criteria add to the \nflexibility of the ALERT system. Its on-board memory allows the storage of multiple \ncommand files and measured datasets prior to external download. \n2.2 Remote operation and telemetry \nIn its default mode of deployment, the ALERT system is housed in a secure enclosure (e.g. \ninstrumentation kiosk) on the site to be monitored. The permanently installed sensor network \nis typically buried below the ground surface [19] and attached to the system inputs. Between \ndata acquisition cycles, batteries are recharged while the system is idle and no measurements \nare scheduled. The ALERT system utilises a serial protocol to allow bidirectional \ncommunication with customised control software via a direct PC connection, PSTN, GSM, or \nsatellite modem. Protocol tunnelling enables the communications link to be established via \nlocal area networks, cellular networks (GPRS, HSDPA) or the Internet. This form of \ntelemetry enables rapid and efficient transfer of all setup parameters, command files and \nmeasurement data. The control software is used to schedule, monitor and retrieve ALERT \nmeasurements from one or multiple field systems on one or multiple remote sites. \n2.3 Data management \nThe automation of geophysical time-lapse processing and inversion requires a high degree of \nconsistency and integrity of measured datasets. This basic prerequisite demands a highly \nstructured approach to handling data. A relational data model was developed to capture the \nfull complexity of time-lapse electrical monitoring data and to allow efficient databasing. On \nthe one hand, this model takes into account the inherent relationships between the measured \nparameters (e.g. resistances, potentials for SP or decay curves for IP) and any metadata \nassociated with the particular dataset, such as for example site details, electrode geometry and \nacquisition settings. Each dataset generated by the ALERT instrumentation contains \nassociated metadata to ensure safe and consistent transfer, processing and storage. On the \nother hand, the data model provides the framework for time-lapse processing and the analysis \nof interdependence between subsequent datasets. \nWe have established a data management system on a dedicated server, handling all \ncommunication, scheduling of data acquisition, data retrieval from field systems, processing \nand storage. A separate machine handles the processor-intensive numerical inversions. \n 7 \n2.4 Processing workflow and delivery of results \nOnce a dataset has been retrieved, it is automatically uploaded to the database. We then apply \nsuitable pre-processing algorithms to screen for outliers and noisy data. Subsequently, the \ndataset is exported to a resistivity inversion algorithm, which generates a resistivity model as \nappropriate, using relevant constraints and a-priori information. After the inversion has been \ncompleted, results are once again uploaded to the database. Finally, a suitable graphical \nrepresentation of the resulting resistivity model (e.g. contour map, colour image, 3D \ntomogram) is generated and uploaded to the web server. End users as well as administrators \ninteract with the data management system through a customised web-based interface, which \noffers a range of options for querying, manipulating and retrieving monitoring information. \n2.5 Optimisation of data acquisition and interpretation strategies \nA powerful argument in favour of automated time-lapse monitoring is that it provides an \nopportunity to use previously collected data for the continuous (and automated) improvement \nof the strategies for acquiring and interpreting new data. This can be achieved by gradually \noptimising the set of electrode array configurations used for data collection [24, 28], based \nupon the results obtained from previous measurements. Ultimately, it is our aim to integrate \nsuch an approach into the ALERT monitoring concept. \n3 Experimental validation with hydraulic experiments \n3.1 Test site design and experimental scenarios \nWe have designed and installed a hydrogeophysical test facility within the grounds of the \nBGS headquarters in Keyworth (Nottinghamshire, UK), which has been continuously \nupgraded since the summer of 2004. The site comprises two test cells, which facilitate a range \nof generic hydraulic experiments at reduced field scale. In this paper we focus on two basic \nexperimental scenarios that we have monitored using the ALERT methodology: \n \nLiquid levels\/phreatic surface. In this scenario, rapid variations in liquid levels were \nmonitored using time-lapse cross-borehole ERT. Conventional hydraulic level measurements \nin monitoring wells only provide information about the immediate vicinity of the borehole, \nwhereas cross-hole ERT can yield estimated properties of the formation between the \nboreholes. An example of where this can be useful is the landfill context, where leachate \nlevels in the waste mass may vary considerably between monitoring points and complex \ninternal structure of the waste and engineered barriers may result in perched leachate tables. \n \n 8 \nLateral tracer transport. In this scenario, rapid lateral transport of a conductive tracer fluid in \na saturated medium was monitored using cross-hole ERT along a multi-borehole fence. This \nscenario can be regarded as a proxy for a wide variety of hydraulic processes, such as solute \ntransport, contaminant migration or leachate recirculation. \n3.1.1 Test cell 1 \nCell 1 comprises a large pit with a depth of 2.25 m (void space approximately 10 m3), \nexcavated into made ground and lined with plywood (Figure 1). The surrounding material \nconsists of reworked mudstones of the Cropwell Bishop Formation (Mercia Mudstone Group, \n[12]), which are rich in clay and of low permeability, thus providing a suitable natural barrier \nfor the purposes of our experiments. Water inflow is provided through a slotted horizontal \npipe at the base of the cell, which was installed in a bed of pea gravel to allow controlled \nwater injection and abstraction from the cell base. Three simulated boreholes were installed in \na central imaging plane, consisting of stainless steel electrodes mounted at 0.1 m separations \non the outside of PVC pipes (34 mm diameter). This design is the scale equivalent of standard \nmonitoring well completions typically used in landfill sites. Each well was equipped with 21 \nelectrodes, resulting in a total of 63 electrodes useable for monitoring. Multicore cables were \nused to connect individual electrodes with the switching modules of the ALERT monitoring \nsystem located in the vicinity of the cell. \nThe void was backfilled with washed and graded high silica sand (Chelford 16\/30, effective \ngrain size d10 = 0.53 mm) to provide a well-defined background medium with reasonably \nhomogeneous hydraulic properties. A hydraulic system was installed in the cell to enable the \ncontrolled saturation of the sand volume and variation of liquid levels. The cell is connected \nto the water mains via a header tank and is filled and emptied through a combination of low-\npower submersible pumps. High and low water submersible sensors control the filling process \nand allow the establishment and retention of accurate liquid levels in the cell. Independent \ncontrol is provided by conventional water level measurements using a water level indicator or \npressure transducer. \n3.1.2 Test cell 2 \nCell 2 was established in the vicinity of Cell 1 and comprises an unlined elongated trench \n(6.0 m \u00d7 1.5 m \u00d7 1.6 m, void space = 14.4 m3), which allows the creation of an approximately \nuniform horizontal flow field by imposing a hydraulic gradient on the saturated volume. A \nmore complex layout with 19 simulated wells was chosen, facilitating the use of both 2D and \n3D imaging configurations (Figure 2). A central fence of 11 wells forms a central imaging \nplane in the trench, with a matrix of 3\u00d74 wells creating a 3D imaging volume offset from the \n 9 \ncentre of the cell. Each well was equipped with 16 electrodes mounted at 0.1 m separations. \nElectrical connectivity was established in the same way as in Cell 1. Cell 2 was backfilled \nwith the same type of sand as Cell 1, except that a finer grade was used (Chelford 52, average \ngrain size 0.267 mm). This was done in order to achieve a suitably low horizontal flow rate \nthrough the trench, so as to avoid image blur during ERT acquisition. A system of pumps and \nlevel sensors was installed, providing precise control over the hydraulic gradient along the \ntrench, which is an essential prerequisite for solute transport experiments. A number of wells \nin Cell 2 were equipped with multilevel sampler ports [6] made of thin PVC tubing to allow \nin situ sampling of pore water from the saturated zone across a range of depths. All wiring \nand services were routed to a nearby portacabin, which served as a field laboratory and \npermanent shelter. A prototype ALERT system was installed in the portacabin along with \nwireless communication in order to simulate remote conditions on a field site. \n3.2 Experiment 1: monitoring liquid levels \nThe first experiment used time-lapse ERT across the three instrumented boreholes in Cell 1 to \nmonitor rapidly rising and falling water levels in the cell. Although the test was repeated \nseveral times, the data presented in this paper are the result of measurements carried out on 31 \nAugust 2006. \n3.2.1 Experimental setup, pumping regime and time scales \nInitially the cell was filled with tap water and the sand saturated to a level of \u201chigh water\u201d \napproximately 0.5 m below ground level (bgl). A constant pumping rate was employed, which \nresulted in a rate of water level change in Cell 1 of around 0.35 m\/h during both injection and \nabstraction. Using this constant pumping rate, the cell was first emptied to a level of \u201clow \nwater\u201d of 1.9 m bgl, where submersible level sensors were set to switch off the abstraction \npumps and activate injection, thus refilling the cell again at the same constant rate. A \ncorresponding set of sensors at the \u201chigh water\u201d level ensured that pumping was reversed \nagain once the cell was fully saturated, thus completing a full pumping cycle. This alternating \npumping regime was maintained over a period of at least 24 hours, so that the cell was \ndrained and refilled at least five times. One half-cycle (either falling or rising water levels) \nlasted approximately 4.5 hours. \n \nA key question in ERT monitoring is whether time-lapse images are able to resolve in \nsufficient detail the spatial property changes associated with the process monitored. In our \nexperiment, the expected change related to the retreat or advance of the phreatic surface, \nwhich in practice takes the form of a capillary fringe (or tension-saturated zone) above a \n 10 \nnotional water table [8]. The degree of saturation of the capillary fringe decreases gradually \nfrom the water table upwards, implying a gradational change in electric properties [2]. The \ncapillary forces and hence the extent of the rise are affected by the pore radius of the medium \nand the surface tension of the liquid. The Washburn equation describes capillary flow for the \nsimplified case of cylindrical capillaries [26], but is found to be applicable to many porous \nmedia in general: \ntrth \u03b7\n\u03b8\u03b3\n2\ncos)( = ,  (1) \nwhere t denotes the time, h the height of rise, \u03b3 the surface tension of the liquid, r the radius of \nthe capillary pore, \u03b8 the wetting angle, and \u03b7 the viscosity of the liquid. The Washburn \nequation refers to a steady process, where the capillary force is compensated by gravity and \nviscous drag. Equation (1) corresponds to the short-time limit (t\u21920) and represents the \nasymptotic solution of the fundamental partial differential equation of Newtonian dynamics \napplicable to the problem [29]. In the long-time limit (t\u2192\u221e), the capillary liquid will rise to a \nstationary level h\u221e, established by the equilibrium between gravity and capillary forces: \ngr\nh \u03c1\n\u03b8\u03b3 cos2=\u221e .  (2) \nHere, \u03c1 denotes the liquid density and g the gravitational acceleration. Assuming \u03b3 = 0.073 \nN\/m for water, \u03b1 = 0, \u03c1 = 998 kg\/m3 at 20\u00b0C, g = 9.8 m\/s2 and r \u2248 0.2 d10, the estimated \nmaximum capillary rise for our experiment in Cell 1 is likely to be h \u2248 0.14 m. This compares \nfavourably with the fundamental vertical resolution of cross-hole ERT monitoring in our \nexperiments, which was expected to be of the order of the electrode spacing on the simulated \nwells (0.1 m). We therefore expected to be able to resolve a transition zone of 1\u20132 electrode \nspacings in the ERT images between the phreatic and vadose parts of the cell. The estimated \ntimescale of capillary flow over this distance of 0.14 m according to equation (2) is \napproximately 5 s (\u03b7 \u2248 10-3 Pa\u22c5s at 20\u00b0C). This is negligible against the timescale of pumping \n(see above) and that of ERT measurements on a crosshole imaging plane. Consequently, time-\nlapse image blur due to capillary-delayed flow was deemed unlikely. \n3.2.2 Array configurations and acquisition strategies \nERT measurements were made using cross-borehole configurations spanning all three \nsimulated wells (W1, W2, W3, cf. Figure 1). The imaging plane comprised two neighbouring \ninter-borehole panels (W1-2 and W2-3). In accordance with Zhou and Greenhalgh [30], we \nopted for the symmetrical bipole-bipole array as the preferred array geometry for all crosshole \nmeasurements. For this geometry, one current electrode and one potential electrode are placed \n 11 \nin each of two wells. In order to keep acquisition time to a minimum, we considered only \nmeasurements where current and potential bipoles were approximately horizontal, i.e. C1 and \nC2 (as well as P1 and P2) were placed at similar depths (Figure 3a). This was deemed adequate \nas previous studies had shown that 2D crosshole resistivity models could be sufficiently well \nconstrained if measurements were made on horizontal bipoles only [5, 15, 27]. \n \nOne important objective of this study was to assess the impact of using multiple panels for \ndata acquisition on tomographic reconstruction and image quality. We devised two \ncomplementary measurement strategies in order to evaluate the effect of measurement \nsequences and timings on image blur during monitoring. The first strategy (referred to as \npanel-by-panel) aims to complete individual inter-borehole panels before moving to a \nneighbouring panel (Figure 3b). With regard to the overall imaging plane, all measurements at \na particular lateral position are therefore made at similar times. The second strategy gives \npriority to interleaved measurements across all neighbouring panels. Measurements at equal \ndepths are therefore made at similar times (Figure 3c). In both cases, resistance measurements \ncommence at the bottom of a panel and current and potential dipoles are then moved up \nsuccessively along the boreholes. For each current injection, the set of measurements with the \nshorter separation between current and potential dipoles (Figure 3a, left-hand diagram) is \ncarried out first; this is followed by the set with longer separations (Figure 3a, right-hand \ndiagram). \n3.2.3 Data processing and inversion \nThe ALERT system uses switched DC source signals with self-adapting current settings. \nInput currents between 4 and 112 mA were employed in Cell 1, depending on the local \ncontact resistance, which is a function of saturation state. We found that comprehensive \nmeasurement schemes covering the complete imaging plane typically required 480 individual \nresistance measurements. Using current pulse widths of 800 ms and minimal stacking of two \nreadings per measurement, these schemes took approximately 15\u201317 min to complete. Data \nacquisition was therefore scheduled every 20 min and automatically performed by the \nALERT system. Individual datasets were transferred via telemetry to the data management \nsystem for processing. Datasets were screened for quality, but were found to require only \nmoderate pre-processing owing to the tightly controlled experimental setup with favourable \nnoise conditions. In almost all occasions, all individual measurements could be retained. \nDatasets were then inverted using a 2D crosshole least-squares smoothness-constrained \nalgorithm (Res2dinv, [17]). \n 12 \n3.2.4 Results and discussion \nFigure 4 shows a direct comparison between two images acquired with the panel-by-panel \n(Figure 4a) and interleaved (Figure 4b) measurement strategies. The tomograms cover the full \nimaging zone comprising both inter-borehole panels (W1-2 and W2-3). Both datasets were \ncollected at identical water levels while the cell was being emptied. The resistivities range \nfrom around 20 \u03a9m (blue) to over 5,500 \u03a9m (red), with intermediate resistivities (~300\u2013\n1,000 \u03a9m) displayed as faint blue, white or faint red colours. The model discretisation we \nhave chosen comprises 480 model cells in 40 layers (5 cm thickness) and 12 columns (10 cm \nwidth). The images show a very clear separation between the water-saturated sand at the \nbottom of the test cell (phreatic zone) and the dry or partially saturated sand at the top of the \ncell (vadose zone). The water table and overlying capillary fringe are represented by a sharp \ntransition from low (blue) to high resistivities (red). \n \nThe two strategies give significantly different results and the image distortion caused by the \npanel-by-panel approach is clearly visible. During the time it took for an individual borehole \npanel to be measured (approximately 7\u20138 min), the water level in Cell 1 had changed by an \nestimated 0.05 m, given the average pumping rate of 0.35 m\/h. Although this change is \nnominally smaller than the anticipated fundamental image resolution of 0.1 m, the impact on \nthe inverted images is obvious. The result of the panel-by-panel acquisition is a skewed \nimage, in which the transition zone is noticeably offset between the two neighbouring panels. \nFor the interleaved scheme, the resulting image shows no distortion as the transition zone is \ntraversed on both panels within a very short period of time. These results demonstrate the \nsensitivity of the bipole-bipole crosshole measurement scheme to variations in the sharp \nvertical contrast in electrical properties. All further measurements were therefore carried out \nwith the interleaved strategy. \n \nA sequence of inverted resistivity images for the full pumping cycle is presented in Figure 5. \nOnly the abstraction phase is shown, in which the water table falls from its maximum to its \nminimum level. The 63 electrode positions used for the experiment are superimposed on the \nimages. The times shown refer to the elapsed time in hours\/minutes relative to the beginning \nof the experiment. Iteration 5 is shown for each inverted model, with RMS misfit errors \nranging between 3 and 8% throughout the sequence. In most of the images, the transition zone \nspans one or two rows of model cells, corresponding to a maximum thickness of around \n10 cm. This result suggests that the extent of the capillary fringe in Cell 1 is limited, which \n 13 \nconfirms the relatively free-draining characteristics of the Chelford 16\/30 sand discussed in \nSection 3.2.1. \n \nAveraging over a large number of model cells allows the calculation of representative values \nfor the bulk resistivities of (1) tap-water saturated and (2) partially saturated or dry sand in the \ntest cell. For the dataset obtained after 1:40 h, the water table divides the model \napproximately in half. At that stage, the upper half of the cells has an average value of \n~1,802 \u03a9m, the lower half of ~89 \u03a9m, i.e. the resistivity contrast between phreatic and \nvadose zones is approximately 1:20. The fluid conductivity of the tap water was measured \nwith a hand-held conductivity meter and showed average values of 650\u2013700 \u03bcS\/cm. This \ncorresponds to fluid resistivities of 14.3\u201315.4 \u03a9m. \n \nConventionally measured water table data have been superimposed on the resistivity images \nin Figure 5 as dashed lines. The sequence of images demonstrates that the ALERT \nmethodology is able to track the falling water table with great accuracy (within the limits of \nthe model discretisation). We found that, for each image in the sequence, the measured water \ntable coincides with the lower edge of the transition zone observed by ERT. \n3.3 Experiment 2: monitoring lateral tracer migration \nThe second experiment was designed to extend the concepts established in Cell 1 to a more \ncomplex imaging scenario. Multiple observation wells in Cell 2 were considered for imaging \nlateral tracer migration using a 2D fence and a 3D grid. In addition to observing tracer \nevolution with ALERT time-lapse imaging, conventional sampling was employed to facilitate \nthe comparison of direct measurements of fluid properties with results derived from electrical \nimaging. A simple petrophysical relationship was used to convert bulk resistivities to \nestimated fluid properties. The following description refers to representative experiments \ncarried out on 24 August 2006 (2D) and 13 September 2006 (3D). \n3.3.1 Experimental setup, pumping regime and time scales \nPrior to the start of the experiment, Cell 2 was filled with tap water to a level just below the \nground surface in order to pre-saturate the imaging zone and to flush out any potential \nresiduals from the pore spaces. Level sensors at the injection and abstraction ends of the cell \n(Figure 2) were then set so that a constant head difference (and thus a constant hydraulic \ngradient) of around 0.5 m (0.15 m bgl to 0.65 m bgl) was maintained across the cell \nthroughout the experiment. This resulted in an approximately uniform horizontal flow field in \nthe majority of the cell volume. The rate of flow was controlled by the hydraulic conductivity \n 14 \nof the Chelford 52 sand (saturated value 2.29\u00d710-4 m\/s) and the hydraulic gradient \n(approximately 0.083) imposed by the pumping. With these values, horizontal flow rates \nalong Cell 2 of approximately 4\u20135 m\/d were expected. Tracer movement at this rate was \ndeemed to be suitably slow for monitoring with ALERT. \n3.3.2 Acquisition strategy \nERT measurements were made on nine simulated wells aligned in a vertical plane along the \ncentre of Cell 2 (W2 to W10, cf. Figure 2). Consequently, the imaging zone now comprised \neight neighbouring inter-borehole panels, resulting in a total of 144 electrodes used for this \nexperiment. As in Cell 1, bipole-bipole configurations were used exclusively. A comparison \nof strategies analogous to that described under Section 3.2.2 showed that in the case of Cell 2, \npanel-by-panel data acquisition could help avoid horizontal distortion. As the aim of the \nsecond experiment was to image lateral movement (as opposed to vertical movement in Cell \n1), a panel-by-panel strategy was preferred on this occasion in order to minimise image skew. \n \nDue to the larger number of electrodes, longer measurement times were required. We found \nthat schemes with approximately 1400 individual resistance measurements gave the best \nresults in the shortest possible time. Using identical source parameters as in Cell 1, these \nschemes took approximately 35 min to complete on the nine-well fence. Data acquisition was \ntherefore scheduled every 40 min and automatically performed by the ALERT system. \nIndividual datasets were again transferred to the data management server for processing. \nDatasets were screened for quality, and only moderate pre-processing was found to be \nnecessary. Typically around 94% of measurements were used for imaging. Datasets were \ninverted in the same way as for Cell 1. A baseline image prior to tracer injection is shown in \nFigure 6, proving that the phreatic surface of the stationary flow in Cell 2 follows a drawdown \ncurve caused by abstraction at the end of the cell. \n3.3.3 Tracer design and injection procedure \nCooking salt (predominantly NaCl) dissolved in tap water at moderate concentrations is \nenvironmentally benign and was considered suitable for use as a tracer fluid in our test cells. \nThe exact concentration is an important experimental design parameter as it controls not only \nthe electrical conductivity of the tracer (and hence the contrast against the background \nmedium), but also its density. As saline solution is denser than tap water, a saline plume \ninjected into a freshwater-saturated porous medium will sink under gravity. In the context of \nour experiment, sufficiently high electrical contrast is desirable for successful resolution with \n 15 \nERT, but high-concentration tracers may sink at a faster rate than the horizontal flow rate, \nthus potentially missing the zone of greatest sensitivity. \n \nTracer design is discussed in some detail by Slater et al. [22], who point out that for a medium \nsaturated with a stagnant fluid of density \u03c10, an estimate for the gravity-induced downward \nflow of a plume of fluid of density \u03c11 is described by \n)( 01d \u03c1\u03c1\u03bc \u2212\n\u22c5= gkv ,  (3) \nwhere k denotes the intrinsic permeability of the medium, g the gravitational acceleration and \n\u03bc the fluid dynamic viscosity. The velocity vd is known as the Darcy velocity. A tracer \nconcentration of 20 g\/l was adopted for this experiment, corresponding to an approximate \ndensity contrast between tracer fluid and tap water of \u224820 kg\/m3. Laboratory measurements \nhad established the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the Chelford 52 sand to be 2.29\u00d710-4 \nm\/s, corresponding to an intrinsic permeability of 2.34\u00d710-11 m2 (\u224824 darcy). Expected Darcy \nvelocities were therefore of the order of 0.4 m\/day. Compared to the expected horizontal flow \nrates along Cell 2 of approximately 4\u20135 m\/d, gravitational sinking of the tracer fluid was \nlikely to be sufficiently slow to allow successful traversing of the imaging zone within the \ntime scale of the experiment. Our tracer fluid showed a fluid conductivity of 30 mS\/cm \n(corresponding to a resistivity of 0.33 \u03a9m), which is at least 40 times that of the tap water \nused (average conductivity 650\u2013700 \u03bcS\/cm), thus offering good electrical contrast. A total of \n25 l of tracer fluid was injected over a 1.5 h period through a multilevel sampler tube at W9 at \na depth of 0.4 m, so that the tracer was immediately exposed to the surrounding flow field. \n3.3.4 Direct sampling strategy and comparison of properties \nPore water samples were obtained from Cell 2 at regular intervals during the tracer \nexperiment, so that direct comparison was possible between fluid properties determined on \nthe sample and those inferred from the electrical images. Using the multilevel sampler tubes \nand a peristaltic pump, small samples (~30 ml) were extracted on several wells from a range \nof depths at regular intervals coincident with electrical data acquisition. Fluid conductivities \nwere measured with a handheld conductivity meter. \n \nAlternatively, fluid conductivities can be estimated from the bulk resistivities determined by \nERT through application of petrophysical relationships. In our experimental setup, only clean \nunconsolidated sand is employed, which has a clay content of practically zero. It is therefore \nsafe to assume that surface conduction is negligible and simple estimates of fluid properties \n 16 \ncan be made by applying Archie\u2019s Law, in which fluid conductivity \u03c3w is linked to bulk \nformation conductivity \u03c3t by an empirical formation factor [1]: \nFS w\nn\nw\nm\nwt \u03c3\u03c6\u03c3\u03c3 ==   (4) \nIn our experiments, this formation factor F can be estimated from the observed bulk \nresistivity of tap-water-saturated sand, given that the pore water properties are well known. \nThis bulk value was calculated as a resistivity average for the phreatic zone as detected in the \nbaseline image (Figure 6), and an approximate formation factor of F\u22485.9 was obtained by \ncalculating the ratio wt \u03c3\u03c3 . \n3.3.5 Results and discussion \nThe sequence of inverted resistivity images obtained during the tracer test is shown in Figure \n7. The time span required for the tracer to enter at the injection point, traverse the length of \nthe imaging zone and disappear from the images is approximately 24 hours. Given a \nminimum interval of 40 min required per imaging snapshot (see Section 3.3.2), a maximum \nnumber of 36 frames could be obtained over that period, highlighting the limitations in \ntemporal resolution currently achievable with ERT monitoring. Each tomogram covers the \nfull imaging zone comprising eight inter-borehole panels (W2\u20133 to W9\u201310, cf. Figure 2). The \nsimulated wells with the 144 electrode positions used for this experiment are superimposed on \nthe first image in Figure 7. The times shown refer to the elapsed time in hours\/minutes \nrelative to the beginning of the experiment. The resistivity colour scale ranges from 2.5 \u03a9m \n(blue) to around 390 \u03a9m (red), with intermediate resistivities (~19\u201350 \u03a9m) displayed as \ntransitionary colours. The chosen model discretisation contains 1280 model cells in 32 layers \n(5 cm thickness) and 40 columns (10 cm width). Iteration 5 is shown for each inverted model, \nwith RMS errors reaching around 4\u20136% throughout the sequence. \n \nIn addition to the water-saturated zone and the dry or partially saturated zone already evident \nfrom the baseline image (Figure 6), the tracer plume can now be clearly distinguished in the \nimages. As before, resistivities <20 \u03a9m are found to represent saturated sand with elevated \nsalinities. The lowest bulk resistivities observed are around 1.3 \u03a9m, i.e. over five times the \nvalue of the tracer liquid at its original concentration. The first image in the sequence \ncoincides with the start of tracer injection, showing a faint conductive spot at the injection \npoint. The overall duration of tracer injection was approximately 1:30 h, hence injection was \ncompleted within the first three image frames. In the following images, the conductive plume \nthen grows in size and can eventually be seen to move in the direction of the hydraulic \ngradient (towards the left of the image) after 2:40 h. The neighbouring borehole is reached \n 17 \nafter 3:20 h and parts of the plume begin to differentially move downwards under the \ninfluence of gravitational sinking. This is particularly evident from 6:00 h onwards. In the \nfollowing images, the tracer plume assumes an increasingly elongated shape until its front \nreaches the downstream boundary of the imaging zone. In the wake of the plume, the \nsaturated zone is found to quickly revert back to resistivity values comparable to those prior \nto injection. The plume has almost completely disappeared from the imaging zone after \naround 22:00 h. A downward loss of small amounts of tracer in the leftmost four wells (W2 to \nW5) is revealed in the images, manifested in increased conductivities along the borehole \ncolumns. This can be explained by the fact that W2 to W5 were amongst a group of wells that \nhad been completed with slotted casing, thereby allowing the passing tracer front to penetrate \nthe free water column inside the well. \n \nA time-sequence of ERT images can act as a proxy for spatio-temporal sampling of tracer \nbreakthrough [4]. For the purpose of comparison with the pore water samples, fluid \nconductivity estimates were obtained from the ERT results. Bulk resistivities were extracted \nfrom ERT model cells that corresponded to the locations at which direct samples had been \nobtained from MLS ports. By applying the empirically determined formation factor described \nin Section 3.3.4, fluid conductivities were estimated. Plotting both datasets along the same \ntime axis (\u201cbreakthrough curves\u201d) allowed us to study the evolution of pore water \nconductivity as seen by the two different methodologies. The results of this comparison are \nshown in Figure 8. Both datasets show characteristic maxima at times when the tracer plume \npasses the sampling point. We observed excellent correspondence between both \nmethodologies at the shallower sampling points. At greater depth however, the ERT-derived \nestimates are consistently lower than those obtained from direct sampling. We suspect that \nthis may be either (1) an intrinsic effect of the smoothness constrained inversion algorithm or \n(2) a systematic error introduced by the physical sampling procedure, which may disturb the \nlocal flow regime by abstracting significant amounts of pore fluid. This effect is exacerbated \nat greater depths, where more vigorous pumping over longer periods of time is usually \nrequired to extract a viable pore water sample. \n3.4 The 3D experiment: setup, results and discussion \nAn identical tracer experiment to the one described in Section 3.3 was carried out to \ndemonstrate the viability of 3D crosshole monitoring with ALERT. Due to the conceptual \nsimilarity, we only briefly describe the setup of the 3D experiment here. A 3\u00d73 grid of \nsimulated wells in Cell 2 (W13, 14, 15, 4, 5, 6, 17, 18, 19, cf. Figure 2) was used to acquire \n 18 \n3D imaging data at regular intervals (one frame per hour). For each 3D frame, a total number \nof 2112 resistance measurements were made across all possible combinations of inter-\nborehole panels between neighbouring wells on the 3\u00d73 grid (e.g. W13\u20134, W13\u201314), but no \ndiagonal panels (e.g. W13\u20135) were included. Typically, around 95% of these measurements \nwere used for inversion. A 3D least-squares smoothness-constrained algorithm was employed \n(Res3dinv, [18]). \n \nSaline tracer with the same specifications as for the 2D case was injected through W7. The \ngreater proximity of the injection point to the imaging zone was expected to result in the \nplume geometry to remain more coherent whilst passing through the monitored volume. The \nsetup also implies a shorter time scale of the 3D experiment compared to the 2D scenario. The \nresults of this experiment are shown in Figure 9 as a sequence of 3D tomograms (image \ncubes) centred on the 3\u00d73 grid. The orientation of the coordinate system is such that the x-axis \nis parallel to the long side of Cell 2, with numbers increasing from the abstraction end \ntowards the injection end of the cell. The flow field therefore enters the imaging cubes from \nthe left and exits on the right through the back wall of the cube. Resistivity isosurfaces with a \n5 \u03a9m threshold value have been calculated for each frame, reflecting the approximate volume \nwithin which the tracer plume is contained at that particular time. The first arrival of the tracer \nplume at the imaging zone is observed after five hours. The plume then traverses the \nmonitored volume over a period of several hours. It is well constrained within the 3D volume \ndespite the relatively small number of sensors available for this experiment. After 14 hours \nthe plume has left the imaging zone and no residual trace is visible after that time. \n4 Conclusions \nWe have developed the technologies and procedures required to implement the ALERT \nconcept of automated near-real-time geoelectrical monitoring, allowing us to remotely \ninitiate, control and manipulate data acquisition and processing for time-lapse electrical \nimaging and tomographic reconstruction. Validation of this concept has been achieved \nthrough a series of controlled hydraulic experiments using cross-borehole ERT \nmeasurements. We have successfully demonstrated that ALERT is capable of monitoring \ngeneric hydraulic processes of varying complexity (2D plus time, 3D plus time) and at \nrelatively short timescales, which are often associated with safety-critical applications (e.g. \nmonitoring of embankment dams, subsurface reservoirs or hydrothermal systems) or \ncommercial\/industrial operations (e.g. leachate recirculation in landfills, underground gas \nstorage facilities). The limiting factor inherent to the ALERT concept is the finite amount of \n 19 \ntime needed to acquire sufficiently comprehensive datasets, thus allowing reliable \ntomographic reconstruction. Our experiments have shown that typical frame rates of 1.5\u20133 \nimages per hour are possible without compromising image quality or jeopardising the flow of \ninformation to and from the remote site. \n \nWe have investigated different strategies for practical data acquisition with the aim of \nharmonising the measurement scheme with the characteristics of the monitored process. For \ncrosshole data acquisition in multi-well monitoring applications, the interleaved measurement \nsequence favours hydraulic processes with rapidly occurring changes in vertical direction and \ncan therefore be regarded as an optimised strategy for level monitoring applications. The \npanel-by-panel strategy was found to favour processes causing rapid horizontal changes, and \nis therefore optimal for flow monitoring. \n \nA simple quantitative comparison between ERT-derived pore water properties and direct \nsampling results showed good correspondence in the observed breakthrough curves, \nindicating that the ALERT concept holds promise beyond the purely qualitative interpretation \nof time-lapse images. Future developments should focus on the potential for shortening \nmeasurement times and optimising acquisition schemes in order to further improve the value \nof ALERT in realistic field applications. \n \n5 Acknowledgements \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British \nGeological Survey (NERC).
