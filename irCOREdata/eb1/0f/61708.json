Introduction\nThe relativistic electron flux in Earth\u2019s outer radiation belt varies by over five orders16\nof magnitude [Baker and Kanekal, 2007] and is responsible for certain types of satellite17\nmalfunctions [Wrenn et al., 2002]. Flux variations are due to a combination of electron18\nacceleration, transport, and loss processes acting within the magnetosphere [Reeves et al.,19\n2003; Li et al., 1997], indicating that the magnetosphere is a gigantic particle accelera-20\ntor. For many years inward radial diffusion from a source beyond geosynchronous orbit21\n(L = 6.6) has been considered the dominant mechanism for transport and acceleration22\n[Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974], and is enhanced by ULF waves [Elkington et al., 1999], but23\nrecent observations show that the electron phase space density can peak near L = 4.524\n[Green and Kivelson, 2004; Iles et al., 2006] suggesting that a local acceleration process25\nis required. Acceleration by whistler mode chorus waves is an important mechanism for26\nlocal acceleration [Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers et al., 1998, 2002; Meredith et al.,27\n2002; Horne et al., 2003, 2005a], and was shown to be particularly effective in accelerating28\nelectrons during the 2003 Halloween magnetic storm [Horne et al., 2005b] and in the slot29\nregion during other storms [Thorne et al., 2007]. Here we show that another type of wave,30\nknown as fast magnetosonic waves, can also be very effective in accelerating electrons up31\nto relativistic energies in the outer radiation belt, and must be considered as an additional32\nlocal acceleration mechanism.33\n2. Wave observations\nFigure 1 shows fast magnetosonic waves detected by the STAFF instrument [Cornilleau-34\nWehrlin et al., 2003] on CLUSTER 3 as it crossed the magnetic equator on 25 Nov 2002.35\nD R A F T June 18, 2007, 9:23am D R A F T\nX - 4 HORNE ET AL.: ELECTRON ACCELERATION BY MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nThe event occurred during an unusually long storm recovery phase when the ring current36\nwas enhanced for a 4-5 day period (Dst \u223c \u221240nT ), and when the > 2 MeV electron flux37\nmeasured by GOES 10 (not shown) was a factor of 10 higher than the pre-storm level38\nbefore 21 Nov. The waves can be identified by the intense emissions between 20 and 60 Hz,39\nbelow the lower hybrid resonance frequency fLHR (solid line) but above the local proton40\ngyrofrequency fcH , which is approximately 5.1 Hz at the equator. The waves are confined41\nto a magnetic latitude of \u03bbm \u2248 \u00b13o, and are far more intense than chorus for this event,42\nwhich is the band of emissions above fLHR rising in frequency towards the equator. The43\nwaves were detected in both the electric and magnetic antennas indicating that they are44\nelectromagnetic and have a high degree of elliptical polarization (with ellipticity\u2248 0) from45\nwhich the calculated direction of the k vector is approximately \u03c8 = 89o with respect to the46\nambient magnetic field directionBo. The frequency range and degree of ellipticity indicate47\nthat the waves propagate across the magnetic field with the wave electric field in the plane48\nalmost perpendicular to Bo and k with the wave magnetic field along Bo. These waves49\nare known as fast magnetosonic waves or equatorial noise. Earlier observations reported50\nwaves between 2 \u2264 L \u2264 7, [e.g., Gurnett, 1976; Perraut et al., 1982; Laakso et al., 1990]51\nwithin 10o of the magnetic equator [Santol\u00b4\u0131k et al., 2004]. More recent studies show that52\nthe intensity of the waves peaks within \u03bbm \u223c 2o \u2212 3o [Santol\u00b4\u0131k et al., 2002; Ne\u02c7mec et53\nal., 2005]. Magnetosonic waves are generated by a proton ring distribution at frequencies54\nclose to the harmonics of the proton gyrofrequency [Boardsen et al., 1992, Horne et al.,55\n2000] and can propagate both inside and outside the plasmapause [Kasahara et al., 1994;56\nHorne et al., 2000].57\nD R A F T June 18, 2007, 9:23am D R A F T\nHORNE ET AL.: ELECTRON ACCELERATION BY MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 5\n3. Resonant wave-particle interactions\nMagnetosonic waves can interact strongly with electrons and ions via Doppler shifted\ncyclotron resonance, given by\n\u03c9 \u2212 n\u03a9\u03c3\/\u03b3 \u2212 k\u2016v\u2016 = 0 (1)\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular wave frequency, \u03a9\u03c3 is the cyclotron frequency for a particle species58\n\u03c3, n is the harmonic number, \u03b3 is the relativistic mass correction factor and v\u2016 is the59\nelectron velocity component parallel to the background magnetic field direction Bo. Solv-60\ning this equation together with the dispersion relation for whistler mode propagation at61\nlarge angles we can obtain the electron resonant energies and pitch angles. For the band62\nof waves observed by CLUSTER 3 between 0.0026 \u2264 \u03c9\/|\u03a9e| \u2264 0.0044, with \u03c9pe\/|\u03a9e| = 363\nand assuming \u03c8 = 89o, all cyclotron resonances occur at energies well above 3 MeV (Fig-64\nure 2) and are therefore unlikely to play a significant role in electron scattering. However,65\nLandau (n = 0) resonance (central vertical dashed line for \u03c8 = 89o) is possible over a66\nwide range of energies from below 100 keV up to the speed of light and occurs at larger67\npitch angles with increasing energy. Note that Landau resonance extends over a range of68\nv\u2016\/c when a band of waves with a spread of wave normal angles is taken into account, as69\ndescribed below.70\nFor a broad band of waves, such as those shown in Figure 1, it is more appropriate to71\ndiscuss electron scattering as a diffusion process in pitch angle and energy. To determine72\nthe efficiency of the interaction it is necessary to calculate the diffusion coefficients and73\ndetermine the shape of the pitch angle distribution. The diffusion coefficients depend74\non the distribution of wave power in frequency and wave normal angle and are given by75\nD R A F T June 18, 2007, 9:23am D R A F T\nX - 6 HORNE ET AL.: ELECTRON ACCELERATION BY MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nGlauert and Horne [2005]. Figure 3a shows the magnetic field wave intensity obtained76\nfrom a least squares fit to the 1s CLUSTER 3 data (black) and the 45s averaged data77\n(red). The wave intensity is high over a three minute interval as the satellite crosses the78\nmagnetic equator. A least squares fit to a Gaussian distribution for the data averaged79\nbetween 16:29:36 and 16:32:36 UT gave a peak frequency at \u03c9m\/|\u03a9e| = 3.49 \u00d7 10\u22123,80\na width \u03b4\u03c9\/|\u03a9e| = 8.86 \u00d7 10\u22124 and a wave amplitude Bw = 218 pT (Fig. 3b). The81\nangular distribution was also assumed to be Gaussian in X = tan\u03c8 peaked in a direction82\nXm = tan 89\no with a width Xw = tan 86\no. Interactions between waves and electrons at83\nhigher latitudes were taken into account by bounce averaging the diffusion rates assuming84\nthe wave power remains constant for \u03bbm \u2264 \u00b13o, and zero at higher latitudes, using a85\nconstant plasma density and dipole magnetic field. The bounce averaged pitch angle86\n< D\u03b1\u03b1 > \/p\n2 and energy < DEE > \/E\n2 diffusion coefficients, in units of s\u22121, are shown87\nin Figure 4 for L = 4.5.88\nScattering rates are most effective at large pitch angles > 50o with energy diffusion time-89\nscales of the order of a day between 0.3 and 1 MeV, and a few days at 0.1 and 3 MeV. Since90\npitch-angle scattering does not extend into the loss cone, which is approximately 4.5o at91\nL = 4.5, magnetosonic waves will not cause electron precipitation loss into the atmosphere.92\nInstead, the waves cause electron stochastic acceleration from energies of \u223c 0.1 to a few93\nMeV. The energy difusion rates are comparable to those for whistler mode chorus during94\nmagnetic storm times [Horne et al., 2003; 2005a], with timescales comparable to that95\nfor electron acceleration during the recovery phase of magnetic storms, which is typically96\n1-2 days [Baker et al., 1994]. Note that the energy diffusion rates maximise between97\nD R A F T June 18, 2007, 9:23am D R A F T\nHORNE ET AL.: ELECTRON ACCELERATION BY MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 7\n50o\u2212 80o, so that magnetosonic waves would tend to produce a butterfly type pitch angle98\ndistribution.99\nSince magnetosonic waves are also observed inside the high density plasmasphere, Figure100\n5 shows the diffusion rates at L = 4.5 for fpe\/fce = 10. Increasing the plasma frequency101\nreduces the parallel phase velocity of the waves so that resonance with the same energy102\nelectrons occurs at larger pitch angles (Figure 2). Note also that energy diffusion is103\nincreased at lower energies as a result of the change in phase velocity, so that substantial104\nacceleration is now possible from energies near 30 keV. However, energy diffusion rates at105\n1 MeV are substantially smaller inside the plasmasphere.106\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nIon ring distributions form in the ring current during magnetic storms as a result of107\nlosses due to slow ion drift [Lennartsson et al., 1981; Fok et al., 1995]. Since magnetosonic108\nwaves are generated by ion ring distributions and accelerate electrons, we suggest that109\nthey contributed to the elevated electron flux observed during the event on 25 Nov 2002,110\nand could be an important energy transfer process from the ring current to the Van Allen111\nradiation belts. However, since acceleration may occur simultaneously with loss by other112\nwave modes at other MLT regions, there may not be a simple relationship between the113\nstrength of the ring current and the radiation belt flux.114\nA full assessment of the importance of these waves for electron acceleration requires115\ndetailed analysis of the occurrence rate of magnetosonic wave power and it\u2019s variation116\nwith L, MLT, \u03bbm, and magnetic activity. To assess how important they could be, we note117\nthat magnetosonic waves between fcH and fLHR have the most intense magnetic field118\nD R A F T June 18, 2007, 9:23am D R A F T\nX - 8 HORNE ET AL.: ELECTRON ACCELERATION BY MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nfluctuations of all the natural emissions in this frequency range and an occurrence rate of119\n60% between 3.9 and 5Re measured by CLUSTER over all MLT [Santol\u00b4\u0131k et al., 2004].120\nUsing this to assume that electrons interact with waves for 60% of the drift orbit, the121\nbounce and drift averaged energy diffusion rates for magnetosonic waves are comparable122\nto those for whistler mode chorus [Horne et al., 2005a]. Since chorus waves are very123\neffective in producing MeV electrons [Varotsou et al., 2005], we suggest that electron124\nacceleration by magnetosonic waves could be as important as acceleration by chorus.125\nMagnetosonic waves will accelerate a seed population of \u2265 10 keV electrons. Thus126\nsome source of electron injection, such as substorms, is still required to transport \u223c 10127\nkeV electrons into L \u223c 4. Acceleration of the low energy component is most effective128\ninside the high density plasmapause, but higher energies will be achieved outside. Since129\nmagnetosonic waves do not scatter into the loss cone, the need for a continuous supply of130\nlow energy electrons is not as stringent as it is for acceleration by chorus.131\nAcknowledgments.
