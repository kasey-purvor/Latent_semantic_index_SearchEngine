The paper indicates several ways in which modelling activities may be\napproached and identifies some educational development roles for learning technologists.\nThe paper concludes by advocating simulation modelling as an exemplary use of learning\ntechnologies - one that realizes their creative-transformative potential.\nForeword\nI first encountered David Squires at Hertfordshire's Advisory Unit for Computer Based\nEducation in 1981, little knowing that we were destined to share an office at Chelsea\nCollege and to work for the pioneering Computers in the Curriculum Project (CIC). On\njoining Chelsea's Educational Computing Unit in 1983, David soon introduced me to his\nwork with Jon Ogborn on the Dynamic Modelling System and their combined influences\nare apparent still, both in my educational research and in this paper.\nDavid was a pioneer at heart with a laid-back enthusiasm for innovative ideas and the\neducational opportunities afforded by microcomputers. During the 1980s, he managed and\ndirected a variety of educational projects encompassing simulations, games, modelling\n54\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nprograms, science microworlds and a collaborative environmental database - pretty much\nthe full gamut of what Laurillard terms the adaptive and productive media. Despite the\nrange of David's interests and the ambition of his software development projects, he\nbrought to his work a characteristic good humour, never being overwhelmed by his\nincreasing responsibilities as he progressed from being a co-director of CIC to become a\nlecturer and, eventually, a professor of King's College London.\nDavid's success may be attributable to his easy-going manner and a combination of a day-\nto-day pragmatism with a long-term educational vision. This proved to be a potent mix\nand one that endeared him to many of his colleagues and friends. Today, we miss his\npersonal and professional presence and can only wonder what he might have gone on to\nachieve. We look to a new generation of learning technologists for his natural successors.\nTime for change\nEducational games, simulations, microworlds and modelling programs were in the\nmainstream of 1980s computer-assisted learning (CAL) when students were expected to\nengage and participate, to compete and collaborate, and to create and produce within their\ntheoretical fields. Since then, the technologies have improved by leaps and bounds whilst\nthe adaptive and productive media seemingly have drifted into an educational backwater.\nThese media receive only passing mention in the ALT overview of learning technologies\n(Seale and Rius-Riu, 2001), and Laurillard (2002), suggests that they are underdeveloped\nand underutilized in higher education. It is as though the users of learning technologies\nhave turned their backs on students as creators and producers, in favour of enhanced\ninformation delivery and ease of administration.\nTo correct this apparent mission drift, it is suggested that learning technologists raise staff\nawareness of simulation modelling with programs like STELLA (see Figure 1), that\nsupport both modelling activities by students and the development of educational\nsimulations.\nFigure I: A STELLA\u00ae simulation\ncontrol panel - assembled from\ndrag and drop components, as is\nthe underlying systems model\n('Population and Resources' model\nprovided with STELLA 7 by High\nPerformance Systems')\nDashboard\n2:Nairt Resources\n2013\nTen\nUnfurl the\nmodel\nn 9*fHi Aion nt i\n1 ij\n\/ i\n'1 !\nI \u00bb I\n-Q-m View theModel...\n55\nDavid Riky Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\nA pedagogic case for the productive media is made by Laurillard, who points to their\nunique potential for letting students create and produce their own mathematical and\nformal models of the world (Laurillard, 2002). Computer simulations and games allow\nstudents to interact with pre-defined dynamic models but only microworlds and modelling\nprograms allow students readily to create such models for themselves. This paper seeks to\nillustrate this notion of students as the authors of models and seeks to complement\nLaurillard's account by highlighting:\n\u2022 the 1980s modelling initiatives of David Squires and the Computers in the Curriculum\nProject;\n\u2022 subsequent developments in the learning and teaching of systems modelling, with\nspecial reference to geographic and business education;\n\u2022 educational development roles for learning technologists interested in promoting and\nsupporting simulation modelling.\nThis quick dash through time, and the world of modelling, is inevitably partial and\nillustrative rather than comprehensive and definitive. The paper introduces just two models\nand modelling programs prior to a discussion of approaches to classroom modelling and\neducational development roles for learning technologists. An extensive list of references\nhas been provided to compensate for this selectivity, and for the lack of case studies or of\nevaluations of classroom use. In the latter respect, modelling provides particular\nchallenges. Modelling is a creative and relatively open-ended activity, there are no paper-\nbased equivalents, the pedagogy of modelling is weakly developed across the curriculum,\nand modelling is still a comparatively rare educational activity. Indeed, one hopes that this\npaper will attract learning technologists to these unexplored pedagogic frontiers and to\nseek out covert instances of modelling within their own institutions.\nModelling in the 1980s: a CIC perspective\nOne cannot write about modelling in the UK in the 1980s without mention of David\nSquires. He spent much of the 1980s as a co-director of the Computers in the Curriculum\nProject where he was an international figure in the development of games, simulations,\nmicroworlds and modelling software for science curricula (Squires and McDougall, 1986;\nWatson, 1987). David championed the educational use of microworlds and modelling\nprograms and, to take just one example, worked with Jon Ogborn to produce the Dynamic\nModelling System (DMS), which is described below.\nModelling with DMS\nDMS enabled students to create computer models without first having to learn calculus\nand a programming language such as FORTRAN (Lai, 1987; Riley, 1986; Wong, 1987). As\nwith early spreadsheets, or predecessors such as MODL (Hartley and Lewis, 1984; Hartley,\n1984), students could use DMS to explore the theories of their subject fields, whilst the\ncomputer performed the repetitive numerical calculations.\nDMS was significant because it widened student, and teacher, access to simulation\nmodelling as a learning activity. Providing access to a novel classroom activity was not\nsufficient however, and it was recognized that packs of illustrative models and guidance on\ntheir use would be needed. Hence, David directed the publication of sets of illustrative\n56\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nmodels for sixth-form and undergraduate Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics and\nGeography. An example of an elementary demographic model is shown in Figure 2. Such a\nmodel was intended to serve as a starting point for modelling activities in the life or social\nsciences where students were to investigate the growth of plant, insect, animal or human\npopulations. The models were meant to be simple so that students could readily\ncomprehend, criticize and improve upon them. Some illustrative sequences of progressively\nmore complex models were included in the DMS packs to show how modelling activities\nmight proceed through processes of elaboration and refinement.\nFigure 2: An elementary demographic\nmodel as viewed in the four display pads\nof the Dynamic Modelling System: any\ntwo of the four pads could be displayed\nsimultaneously on the low resolution\nscreens of 8-bit microcomputers\nXNDsBIKTXS-SEMXS\nrant\n1\nror\nlist\n10M\nltM\n112\u00ab\n1150\nlira\n12 la\n1241\n12 T\n1301\nFigure 2 reproduces the display pads of DMS with a model of annual population growth\nresulting from constant numbers of births and deaths. DMS calculated the results from the\ninitial values and the model's difference equations, with each iteration of the model\nstanding for the passage of a short time interval. Models were expressed as mathematical\n'difference equations' written in the BASIC programming language, thus a statement like:\n'POP = POP + INC was read as: 'LET the current size of the population BECOME\nEQUAL TO the previous size of the population PLUS the increase in population.'\nOnce students were familiar with DMS, they could adapt and extend the models. For\nexample, the above model could be improved by introducing crude birth and death rates, in\nplace of the fixed annual increments. The inclusion of immigration and emigration rates\ncould add further dimensions to a model of, say, a period of industrial growth in Victorian\nManchester or 1980s Hong Kong. Students could gather empirical data on critical rates of\nchange, investigate their model's sensitivity to different rates of change, and relate their\nfindings to known or anticipated trends in real-life populations.\nUsing learning technologies in this way was educationally attractive as students were\nengaged in researching, authoring and evaluating models. For instance, students using\nDMS might have to:\n57\nDavid Riley Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\n\u2022 locate suitable numeric data, whilst coping with different units and systems of\nmeasurement;\n\u2022 assess the relevance of available data and\/or make reasonable estimates of values;\n\u2022 establish empirical or theoretical relationships between variables;\n\u2022 express these relationships logically\/mathematically;\n\u2022 make sense of tables and graphs of results;\n\u2022 debug or refine their models - until the results were satisfactory;\n\u2022 use the model to solve a problem or to arrive at a forecast.\nStudents typically worked in groups, and so modelling served as a stimulus for valuable\ncommunicative and collaborative activities. Furthermore, many hours of productive\nlearning could be stimulated by a well-designed activity whilst the development of starter\nmodels and model fragments was a relatively quick task for teachers. If time was pressing,\nteachers could 'model' or demonstrate the process of modelling and engage students in\nwhole-class discussions as a model was created, tested and applied to a problem.\nModelling with STELLA\nThe system dynamics modelling program STELLA\u00ae was launched on the Apple\nMacintosh in 1985 and it immediately impressed David Squires and fellow CIC staff.\nSTELLA performed a similar function to DMS but possessed a graphical interface based\non a 'visual plumbing metaphor', as shown in Figure 3. The cloud symbols indicate the\nsystem boundary and serve as infinite sources or sinks of the 'fluid' flowing through the\nsystem. The diagram is animated when the model is run, showing fluid levels rising and\nfalling in the tank, whilst pointers on the dials of taps and the 'Limit_to_growth_fraction'\nconverter move back and forth in response to changing flows and numeric values. Hence,\nthe acronym STELLA: Structural Thinking Experiential Learning Laboratory with\nAnimation.\nPotential unit growth rate\nArtual rate of growth\nLimit to growth fraction\nCarrying capacity\nfigure 3: STELLA diagram of a simple 'Limits to Growth'model: with annotations identifying the positive\n(+ve) and negative (-ve) feedback loops\n58\nALT-J Vo\/ume \/ 0 Number 3\nSystem dynamics stories\nSystem dynamics models show how system behaviour is determined by system structure -\nconceptualized as accumulations, rates of change, delays and closed loops exhibiting\npositive or negative feedback (Forrester, 1961, 1968). For instance, the Limits to Growth\nmodel exhibits the classic pattern of 'S-shaped growth' shown in Figure 4, a dynamic\nperceivable in situations as diverse as the colonization by plants of a volcanic island or the\nsaturation of the market for mobile telephones. According to the tenets of system\ndynamics, a system's behaviour is determined by the internal relationships or structure,\nrather than by events in the external environment, unless the system is pushed beyond the\nlimits within which it can function.\n1: POPULATION SIZE\n1: 10D0.\ngpoo\n2: Actual rate of growth 3: Astral rate of decay\nso1\n3D\nS-shaped growth dynamic\n45 SO\nTime\nFigure 4: STELLA graph of the 'Limits to Growth' model\nFigure 4 'tells the story' of S-shaped growth, an 'archetypal' pattern of behaviour in some\nsystems (Senge, 1990). An initially low population (for instance, of plants or mobile\ntelephones) possesses a slow rate of growth but this begins to increase as 'success breeds\nsuccess' and the reinforcing effects of positive feedback dominate. The population grows\nmost quickly when the difference between the actual rates of growth and decay (death or\nobsolescence) is at its greatest. From that point onwards, population growth is inhibited as\na biophysical or socio-economic limit is approached and the counterbalancing effects of\nnegative feedback become stronger. The population reaches a high and steady level once\nthe growth and decay rates balance and, in effect, there is a saturation of the ecological or\nmarket niche at a level approaching the potential carrying capacity (of, say, majority\nownership of mobile telephones).\nConstructing STELLA models\nSTELLA models are assembled diagrammatically by arranging and connecting symbolic:\npipes and taps (flows), tanks (stocks or accumulations), wires (carrying information about\n59\nDavid Riley Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\ncausal relationships) and converters (information or equation holders). This construction\nkit approach to model-building serves several purposes, it:\n\u2022 encourages users to think about the circular, cause-and-effect relationships within the\nclosed loops of a system dynamics model;\n\u2022 automates the production of difference equations for the stocks;\n\u2022 constrains the writing of equations for the flows and converters - these must include all\nthe inputs shown in the diagram, and can include no other inputs.\nEquations for the flows and converters are entered via an object's dialogue box and a\ncomplete set of equations can be inspected in the 'underlying' equation layer, as illustrated\nin the text box below.\n{INITIALIZATION EQUATIONS }\nINIT POPULATION_SIZE = 2\nUnit_decay_rate = 0.05\nPotential_unit_growth_rate = 0.25\nCarrying_capacity = 1000\nLim'rt_to_growth_fraction = (Carrying_capacfty - POPULATION_SIZE)\/ Carrying_capacrty\nArtuaLrate_of^rowth=POPUI^TION_SIZE*Potential_unit^rowth_rate*Limit_to^rowth_fraction\nActual_rate_of_decay = POPULATION_SIZE * Unit_decay_rate\n{ RUNTIME EQUATIONS }\nPOPULATION_SIZE(t) = POPULATION_SIZE(t-dt) + (Actual_rate_of_growth-Actual_rate_of_decay) * dt\nLimrt_to_growth_fraction = ( Carrying_capadty - POPULATION_SIZE) \/ Carrying_capacity\nActuaLrate_of^rowth=POPULATION_SIZE*Potential_unit_growth_rate* Lim'rt_to_growth_fraction\nActual_rate_of_decay = POPULATION_SIZE * Unit_decay_rate\nNotes: in the runtime stock equation:\"POPULATION_SIZE(t) = ...\"\nPOPULATION_SIZE(t) is the value (in this case, between 2 and 1000) being calculated at time '(t)'.\nPOPULATION_SlZE(t-dt) was the value one time interval before, at time '(t-dt)'.\n'dt' is the short time interval between successive iterations of the model.\nFigure 5: The 'Limits to Growth'model: equations in order of execution\nImplications of STELLA\nTo conclude this account of STELLA, David Squires and fellow colleagues were impressed\nby this modelling program because it:\n\u2022 enabled students to see, modify and author models expressed in a formalism they could\nunderstand and that a computer could execute;\n\u2022 could be used to prototype models for use in CAL games and simulations (Squires and\nMillwood, 1988), CIC developed, trialled and published around 130 games, simulations\nand CAL programs during the 1980s - an average of one per month through the\ndecade;\n\u2022 had the potential to evolve into a simulation authoring system - suitable for teachers\nand lecturers with limited time, technical skills or financial resources.\n60\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nFrom mainstream to backwater\nThe 1980s were notable for the high levels of interest in modelling as a form of computer-\nassisted learning, and for several pioneering initiatives in schools and colleges. Interest in\nthe educational potential of modelling programs like STELLA was not restricted to CIC.\nThere was a widespread interest in modelling amongst CAL developers and the wider\neducational community. For instance, classroom trials of STELLA led to the MODUS\nproject (Hassell and Webb, 1990; Cox and Webb, 1994), and modelling featured in the IT\ncomponent of the newly launched National Curriculum, whilst the London Mental\nModels Group obtained ESRC funding for research into the learning and teaching of\nmodelling (Bliss et al, 1992; Mellar, Bliss, Boohan, Ogborn and Tompsett, 1994).\nThese high levels of interest were not sustained during the 1990s and simulation modelling\nnow seems to receive relatively little attention from learning technologists. This contrast\nwith the 1980s is anomalous, given the:\n\u2022 pedagogic potential of simulation modelling for student engagement and authorship;\n\u2022 ease with which models and simulations can be assembled by students or teachers,\nusing modelling programs like STELLA;\n\u2022 comparative abundance of personal and institutionally owned computers;\n\u2022 vastly improved capabilities of modern computers and networks.\nThe reasons for this anomalous situation are worthy of reflection and, perhaps, of em-\npirical research. For instance, there may be more simulation modelling taking place than is\napparent, with the classroom modelling activities of individual lecturers being relatively\ninvisible to learning technologists. One might hypothesize that, in general, learning\ntechnologists focus upon national and institutional initiatives rather than lecturers'\nunreported activities within departments. This is something learning technologists could\ninvestigate within their own institutions and share with the wider community, either on an\ninformal basis or as a more organized form of empirical research.\nLearning and teaching simulation modelling\nThis section of the paper suggests ways forward and acknowledges some of the\ndevelopments that have taken place over the past decade. If Laurillard suggests the\nsimulation modelling 'glass' is not full, this section suggests it is partially full and filling\nslowly. Some approaches to simulation modelling are outlined, based on the growing\npedagogic literature, and upon personal experience as a lecturer in physical geography at\nthe former University of North London.\nMaking it happen\nStudents may first encounter specific models and the activity of modelling in their lectures,\nwith practical work taking place in supervised 'laboratory' sessions where they gain hands-\non experience of particular modelling programs. Students, often working in small groups,\nmay begin with simple ready-made models and learn to explore and modify these before\nconstructing their own models based on provided materials or information gathered from\nlibrary research. Entirely free invention of models is less likely, although there is more\nscope for originality in students' projects and dissertations, especially at postgraduate level.\n61\nDavid Rifey Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\nOnce students are familiar with the basic principles and practice in their subject field,\nlecturers can refer to models and modelling in other course modules, setting tasks to\ndevelop students' knowledge, skills and attitudes towards modelling. Participation in a\nrange of modelling activities can extend students' experiences of models as tools to 'think\nwith' and to 'think about' (Bliss, 1994a), and also of models as media for sharing ideas and\nexplanations with others.\nReasons for modelling\nStudents may be unfamiliar with modelling as a professional or research practice and\nlecturers may need to describe the roles that modellers play in:\n\u2022 prediction and control (for example, in engineering design);\n\u2022 theory development (for example, in the biophysical and social sciences);\n\u2022 policy-making and decision-support (for example, in business and government);\n\u2022 education, training and entertainment (for example, in simulations and games).\nSimulation modelling originated in the mathematical sciences and engineering as a means\nof predicting and controlling phenomena like the compression of gases, or the mechanical\nloading of structures. The extension of 'modelling to predict and control' from relatively\nwell-theorized, predictable and universal domains, to the social and environmental sciences\nhas been problematic (Bloomfield, 1986; Flood, 1999). Here, phenomena tend to be less\nwell theorized and are likely to be less predictable, as with weather and economic fore-\ncasting (Ogborn and Mellar, 1994). The notions of 'modelling to develop theory' (Gilbert\nand Troitzsch, 1999), or 'modelling to learn' (De Geus, 1992) better suit business education\nand the context-sensitive, more 'situated' social sciences.\nSocial and economic models may also influence the phenomena they simulate, as people\nbecome aware of models and adjust their behaviour. On the one hand, this is a problem not\nfaced by the modellers of biological, mechanical and electrical systems, where the\nprinciples of cybernetics and system dynamics were first formulated (Forrester, 1968;\nLilienfeld, 1978). On the other hand, social responsiveness is turned to advantage where\nmodels are used to influence policy-makers and to inform public opinion. Environment-\nalists are amongst those who have 'modelled to persuade', for instance, the Club of Rome\nreport on global environmental futures and its sequels (Meadows et al, 1972, 1992), and\nJames Lovelock's imaginary Daisyworlds (Watson and Lovelock, 1983; Lovelock, 2000).\nThe latter leads in short order to the notion of 'modelling to entertain' as exemplified by\nthe SimEarth and SimCity type of computer games, which blur the boundaries between\neducation and entertainment.\nApproaches to modelling\nLecturers' reasons for including modelling in the curriculum will vary, depending on the\nsubject field and course goals. This paper focuses on geographic and business education\nwhere social, economic, political and ethical issues are closely linked to the design and\napplication of models in academic, personal, professional and public settings. It is\ndesirable for students to understand what models are, how they are created and how they\nare used - whether to inform and persuade or to confuse and mislead. It is notable that we\nteach a large number of university students about the use and abuse of statistics but teach\n62\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nvery few about the use and misuse of computer models - despite their widespread and\nsignificant applications.\nA common reason for including modelling in the curriculum is that it reveals, and may\nimprove, students' formal reasoning (Mandinach and Cline, 1994; Doerr, 1996; Sweeney\nand Sterman, 2000), with peer discussion and group-work playing supportive roles. The\nextent to which reasoning, communication or collaboration are prioritized is a matter for\nlecturers and course developers to determine along with other course goals. For instance,\nstaff may choose to emphasize either:\n\u2022 cognitive or communicative learning outcomes;\n\u2022 individual or collaborative work;\n\u2022 convergent tasks or open-ended problem-solving;\n\u2022 the exploration of 'classic' models or the expression of students' models (Mellar and\nBliss, 1994);\n\u2022 general mathematical methods or program-specific techniques and 'work-arounds';\n\u2022 idealized theories of modelling or case studies of modelling in practice.\nOptions like these, and others, are not mutually exclusive and the balance between them\nmay vary over a period of several weeks or longer. For instance, students' modelling activ-\nities within a degree programme may culminate in assessed projects or in final dissertations\nwhere students assume more responsibility for their own aims and approaches.\nIntroductory textbooks and resources\nLecturers and students can pick and choose amongst numerous introductory textbooks, of\nwhich there is a range in fields like environmental modelling (Huggett, 1993; Kirkby,\nNaden Burt and Butcher, 1993; McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers, 1997). This range also\nincludes program-specific textbooks with modelling activities based on EXCEL (Hardisty,\nTaylor and Metcalfe, 1993) and STELLA (Ford, 1999). In addition, there are more general\ntexts that address the concerns of human geographers (Macmillan, 1989; Robinson, 1998),\nwhich place greater emphasis on critiques of models and of modelling itself.\nBooks and resources on systems modelling are appearing too, in business and management\neducation (Coyle, 1996; Pidd, 1998; Senge, 1990; Senge, Kleiner, Roberts, Ross and Smith,\n1994), and many of these include sections on, or are based upon, system dynamics. A\nrecent and comprehensive textbook on 'Business Dynamics' (Sterman, 2000), is\naccompanied by a CD-ROM with models and three system dynamics programs: Vensim,2\nPowersim3 and 'ithink' - the version of STELLA targeted at business markets (Repenning,\n1998; Costanza and Voinov, 2001). Further tutorial materials and models are provided by\nSDEP - the System Dynamics in Education Project4 - on its MIT-hosted Website. The\nSDEP Road Maps5 contain some 11MB of introductory and more advanced tutorials,\nmostly in 'pdf' format, that are 'quality assured' by the MIT system dynamics group and\ncan be reproduced for non-commercial purposes.\nThese recent books and electronic resources succeed earlier texts for the modelling\nlanguage DYNAMO (Goodman, 1988; Roberts, Andersen, Deal, Garet and Shaffer, 1983)\nand tend to be less formal in approach and to assume less knowledge of mathematics. Peter\n63\nDavid Riley Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\nSenge's books, in particular, emphasize the concepts of system dynamics and reasoning\nwith paper-based, causal loop diagrams, rather than quantitative modelling on a computer.\nThis approach directly addresses students' conceptual understanding whilst avoiding the\ncomplications that accompany quantification and the use of mathematics. These are issues\nthat arise elsewhere, for instance, with younger students (Bliss, 1994b; Brosnan, 1994), and\nwith the teaching of environmental systems (Inkpen, 1993).\nStill, there are pitfalls with 'semi-quantitative' reasoning (Richardson, 1986 and 1997), and\nit is a moot point whether students should be introduced to causal loop-diagramming\nbefore STELLA or whether the full STELLA formalism should be introduced first, with\ndiagramming as a subsequent simplification. Thus, a lecturer's choice of an introductory\ntextbook or use of online materials may depend upon:\n\u2022 the backgrounds and needs of the students;\n\u2022 the curricular goals and reasons for teaching modelling;\n\u2022 available modelling programs;\n\u2022 the preferred formalism(s);\n\u2022 their sequence of introduction.\nAlso, lecturers can choose between a number of modelling programs and are by no means\nrestricted to those based on system dynamics. Gilbert and Troitzsch, for instajice, suggest\napproaches based on the simulation of discrete events, cellular automata, intelligent agents\nor evolutionary processes may better appeal to social theoreticians.\nTo return to the example of STELLA, lecturers will find this has improved considerably\nover the last fifteen years or so and it now supports Windows computers. Also, it provides\nan additional communications or interface layer 'above' the original diagram and equation\nlayers. This new layer supports several features, including:\n\u2022 scene-setting introductions and tutorials with text, pictures and QuickTime movies;\n\u2022 annotated step-by-step tours of a complete model or of selected parts to explain the\nunderlying logic and behaviour;\n\u2022 simulation 'control panels', such as the one shown in Figure 1, assembled from\nstandard drag and drop components.\nIn effect, STELLA has become the type of simulation authoring environment originally\nanticipated by David Squires. It is an environment in which lecturers can rapidly produce\nmodels and simulations, without the need for conventional programming skills or the\nassociated development resources and timescales.\nReflections\nThere have therefore been several developments during the 1990s: the publication of\nintroductory textbooks and online resources, and a growth in the number and quality of\nmodelling programs. Whilst Laurillard may be correct in asserting the productive media\nare underutilized in higher education, the above are grounds for some optimism, at least\nwith respect to systems modelling in geographic and business education. Lecturers and\nlearning technologists working in these fields can build upon broader and more substantial\nfoundations than those available one or two decades ago.\n64\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nEducational development roles for learning technologists\nThis final part of the paper suggests learning technologists may be well placed to raise\nawareness of simulation modelling in higher education. Many academic staff are\nappointed on the grounds of their research and income-generating potential rather than\ntheir pedagogic repertoires or use of learning technologies. Although most lecturers new to\nhigher education receive some training, they rarely experience anything equivalent to their\nlengthy apprenticeships as researchers. Many rely on interested colleagues and support\nstaff to suggest improvements to their course modules or to recommend 'new' approaches\nto learning and teaching.\nLearning technologists, through their contacts with lecturers and course development\nteams, are well positioned to:\n\u2022 suggest simulation modelling as a learning activity - when it otherwise may be\noverlooked;\n\u2022 draw attention to available modelling programs, online resources and introductory\ntextbooks either in staff's own fields or in related ones;\n\u2022 assist in the design and production of multimedia support materials and tutorials for:\n- simulations in programs like STELLA;\n- resource-based learning materials on simulation modelling;\n\u2022 advise on the design, assessment and evaluation of modelling activities - as instances of\n. the use of learning technologies;\n\u2022 contribute to the development of new learning environments supporting collaborative\nmodelling activities.\nIndividual learning technologists may not be able to perform all of these roles but one\nhopes they will contribute to curriculum development both in terms of their technical and\neducational expertise. Learning technologists benefit from meeting teaching staff from\naround an institution and can point to practice in different departments. They can help\ninterested academics to network and to share their experiences of approaches outside the\ntraditional repertoire of lectures, seminars, practicals and tutorials.\nOnce academic staff are familiar with programs like STELLA, and simulation modelling\nas a student activity, they may be self-sufficient or need support only to produce\nmultimedia-rich introductions and tutorials. Many academic staff are unused to\ndeveloping student materials for resource-based or distance learning, whilst this is a more\nfamiliar activity to learning technologists. Similarly, academics can benefit from intro-\nductions to the literature on the evaluation of learning technologies and the assessment of\ncomputer-assisted learning activities.\nFinally, Laurillard notes the potential for combining microworlds and modelling programs\nwith communications technologies and points to developments in the commercial and\nentertainment sectors. This is the type of innovation that would have interested David\nSquires and one looks for learning technologists to follow his example and develop new\ncategories of educational applications. This will be neither cheap nor easy but it is a field in\nwhich learning technologists could make important contributions.\n65\nDavid Riley Simulation modelling: educational development roles for learning technologists\nConclusions\nThis paper has drawn attention to simulation modelling and has sought to raise awareness\namongst learning technologists of this distinctive, if relatively neglected, pedagogic\nactivity. Simulation modelling is advocated on the grounds that it:\n\u2022 makes cost-effective use of lecturers' and students' time. Educational simulations,\nmodels or model fragments can be quickly retrieved, modified or created with software\nsuch as STELLA;\n\u2022 enables students to learn through modifying and creating simulation models within\ntheir theoretical field - activities that only the productive media support;\n\u2022 introduces students to modelling as a significant academic and professional practice;\n\u2022 fosters cognitive, communicative and collaborative student activities;\n\u2022 facilitates a participative and productive approach to learning, one that realizes the\ncreative-transformative potential of learning technologies.\nWhilst Laurillard may have exaggerated the underdevelopment and underutilization of\nsimulation modelling, there clearly are opportunities for learning technologists to promote\nand support its 'rediscovery'. Contributions may take many forms, including making\nsuggestions to lecturers, assisting with the production of learning materials, and\ncontributing to software development projects. Simulation modelling provides many\nchallenges for learning technologists, of the type that David Squires used to seize with\nrelish. Now new champions are required, people who can once more bring simulation\nmodelling into the mainstream of higher education and help develop curricula fit for the\ntwenty-first century.\nNotes and relevant Websites\nThe following URLs were last accessed in August 2002.\n1STELLA\u00ae and 'ithink\u00ae' are produced by High Performance Systems: http:\/\/www.hps-\ninc.com and distributed in the UK by Cognitus, http:\/\/www.cognitus.co.uk\/\n2Vensim\u00ae is produced by Ventana Systems.
