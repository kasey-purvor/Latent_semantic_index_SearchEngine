Geophys.\nRes.

The recent interest in\nclimate change and global sea level has led to a focus on trends in sea level\nover time scales of a few years to centuries. The aim of this work has mainly\nbeen to understand the causes and effects of global sea level rise, although\nthere is now increasing interest in the regional patterns of sea level change.\nFor example, loss of mass due to melting of ice from a particular region\nresults in a characteristic pattern of vertical land movement and change in the\ngravitational field, which produces a sea level \u201cfingerprint\u201d, and there have\nbeen several attempts to use these fingerprints to infer the size of meltwater\nsources responsible for recent sea level rise [Mitrovica et al., 2001; Plag, 2006;\nMarcos and Tsimplis, 2007]. Attribution of such patterns to climate change\nassumes that they are not being swamped by dynamical variability in the\nocean. Even more fundamentally, it assumes that the fit of a linear trend to\nthe measured sea level curve is statistically significant.\nAt the same time, sea level and related variables (bottom pressure and\ndensity) are the crucial quantities being measured in efforts to monitor the\nlarge-scale ocean circulation, for example the flow through Drake Passage\n[Woodworth et al., 2006] and the prototype monitoring systems for the North\nAtlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) [Cunningham et al., 2007;\nBingham and Hughes, 2008; Bingham and Hughes, 2009] . While the primary\naim of such systems is to look for secular or step-like changes in the large-scale\nocean circulation, they are operating within a system which has variability\nover a wide range of length and time scales, many of which may be unre-\nlated to the slow, basin-scale variability which is the intended target of the\nmonitoring system. Detection of a meaningful change in the MOC, for exam-\nple, requires that the signal be distinguishable from the background natural\nvariability.\nThese are just two examples, but the point is quite generic: when fitting\na curve to any time series, assessment of the statistical error in the fit de-\npends on the spectrum of the time series. For this reason, it is important\nto understand the shape of spectra of sea level. Such an understanding can\nalso be valuable in understanding the physics of the processes which lead to\nthose spectra.\nSo, we would like to have a model for the natural background spectrum\nof sea level variability\u2014ideally a wavenumber and frequency spectrum. This\nis the subject discussed in detail by Wunsch [2009], who focuses on the mea-\nsurement of ocean transport variability in the North Pacific. Here, we focus\npurely on the frequency spectrum of global sea level variability, and in par-\n2\nticular we address the question of whether there is a canonical spectral shape\nwhich can be used in the assessment of whether fitted trends (or other func-\ntions of time) are statistically significant given the background variability. In\ndoing this, we are in effect treating each time series in isolation, and therefore\nnot taking advantage of any possible correlations between time series, or of\nthe fact that, for example, some parts of the spectrum are likely to be due\nto signals which are correlated (with or without lags) over large distances\nwhereas other parts will represent purely local variability. Our purpose is\nfirst to find out over which scales the shape of the spectrum varies, before\nworrying about the combination of information in time and space domains\n(although we will consider as a special case the globally-averaged sea level\ntime series). From the nature of the satellite altimeter signal being consid-\nered, we expect that the variability will, in many places, be dominated by the\ninfluence of oceanic mesoscale dynamics, although other processes are also\nclearly present. The simplest, and most useful, result would be to find a par-\nticular function of frequency which could be used to represent the spectrum\nat any point.\nPast work has suggested that there might be such a function. Stammer\n[1997], using sea level measurements from the TOPEX\/POSEIDON altime-\nter, emphasized the similarity between spectra from different regions of the\nocean, while pointing out some differences in western boundary currents and\nin the near-equatorial region, and Zang and Wunsch [2001; ZW hereafter]\nbuilt upon this work to suggest a canonical frequency-wavenumber spectrum\nwhich, when scaled by a spatially-varying amplitude factor, was offered as a\nfirst order description of the oceanic spectrum anywhere. On the other hand,\nLe Traon [1991] showed from a regional analysis of Geosat data in the North\nAtlantic that the energetic Gulf Stream region contained relatively more en-\nergy at high frequencies (periods less than about 80 days) than regions of\nthe eastern North Atlantic at similar latitudes. We now have much longer\ntime series of altimetry, and can look into these spectra in more detail.\nIn seeking to investigate the spatial variability of frequency spectra, we\nrun into the difficulty that it is impractical to display a spectrum for each\npoint in the ocean, and area-averaging requires the introduction of precon-\nceived ideas of areas over which the spectrum is assumed to be homogeneous.\nWe address this by introducing a novel method of displaying spectral infor-\nmation in color, exploiting the way the eye is adapted to extracting useful\ninformation from the spectrum of light.\nWe will show that there are significant spatial variations in the shape\nof the spectrum, which cannot be adequately described by one or two pa-\nrameters. In much of the tropics, Rossby wave theory gives a useful aid to\nunderstanding the observed spectrum, as suggested by Lin et al. (2008), but\n3\nat higher latitudes this interpretation breaks down and more complex spa-\ntial variations are seen. In fact, in order to describe the spectral variation\nglobally, we find that a fifth order autoregressive model is required (i.e. 6\nparameters are needed to describe the spectrum, 5 shape parameters and 1\namplitude). Having fitted such a model to each chosen time series of sea\nlevel anomalies, we can then estimate the time required for a sea level trend\n(we assume 1 mm\/year as an example of a typical difference from the global\nmean) to rise above the statistical background variability.\n2 The sea level rainbow\nWe use the delayed-time, reference, merged sea-level anomaly, gridded prod-\nuct from AVISO, which can be downloaded via http:\/\/www.aviso.oceanobs.com\/\nen\/data\/product-information\/duacs\/ssaltoduacs-products\/index.html. Time\nseries at each grid point consist of 630 weekly values over the period 5 April\n1995 to 25 April 2007, in order to avoid a gap in coverage by the ERS1 satel-\nlite before this period, allowing for homogeneous sampling over the period\nconsidered. This dataset is, at all times, derived from a combination of one\naltimeter in the TOPEX\/POSEIDON orbit and one in the ERS 35-day repeat\norbit. The data are provided on a 1\/3 degree Mercator grid covering lati-\ntudes between 82\u25e6S and 82\u25e6N, but the optimal interpolation used means that\nsignals at wavelengths shorter than about 100 km are suppressed (the effec-\ntive cutoff wavelength is somewhat latitude dependent, being longer at lower\nlatitudes). As part of the AVISO processing, the data have been corrected\nfor tides and a barotropic model has been used to estimate and subtract the\nbarotropic response to atmospheric pressure and wind stress forcing. This\nwill reduce the signal mainly at the high frequencies which dominate such\nbarotropic motions. In high latitude coastal regions, where such variations\nare the dominant signal, the model explains about 40\u201350% of the variance\nremaining after application of the traditional Inverted Barometer response\n[Carre`re and Lyard, 2003], and similar accuracy can be inferred for this com-\nponent of the variability in deeper regions, although a smaller percentage\nof variance is explained in deeper regions as a result of other processes be-\ncoming more important. For each time series, we have simultaneously fitted\nand removed annual and semiannual sinusoids and a linear trend, following\nwhich we have used linear interpolation to fill a maximum of 5 gaps of up to\n5 weeks each (gaps are mainly due to seasonal sea ice, but also result from\noccasional instrumental problems). Time series with more or longer gaps are\ndiscarded. Periodograms have then been calculated from Fourier transforms\nof the time series at each grid point. We perform no explicit spectral band\n4\naveraging, as this is implicit in the conversion of spectrum to color.\nIn order to display the resulting spectra, we exploit the fact that the\ncanonical spectrum proposed by ZW is, with a rescaling of frequency, close\nto the spectrum of white light. The ZW spectrum as a function of frequency\n\u03c3 is proportional to \u03c3\u22121\/2 at periods longer than 100 days, and proportional\nto \u03c3\u22122 at shorter periods, so at high frequencies it is what is usually referred\nto as \u201cred\u201d noise. It is a common misconception that the spectrum of visible\nwhite light is equivalent to a \u201cwhite\u201d noise spectrum, in which the Power\nSpectral Density (PSD) is constant as a function of frequency. In fact, the\nvisible spectrum is often plotted as a Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)\nfunction, as a function of wavelength (which is inversely proportional to fre-\nquency). There is a factor of \u03c3\u22122 difference between these two representations\nso, while the SPD of white light is almost flat across the visible part of the\nspectrum, the corresponding PSD is proportional to \u03c3\u22122. White light is \u201cred\u201d\nnoise. A spectrum of light which was truly \u201cwhite\u201d noise would actually ap-\npear to the eye as quite an intense blue. This unfortunate misunderstanding\nleads to a problem of nomenclature. To be clear, colors mentioned here will\nall be visually-perceived colors unless enclosed in inverted commas, in which\ncase the color referred to is that of the conventional definition for colored\nnoise.\nDespite this problem, the true relationship between spectrum and color\nturns out to be rather useful here. We are used to interpreting small differ-\nences from white light (\u201cred\u201d noise) as colors, so if the sea level spectrum was\nexactly \u201cred\u201d noise, a translation into a light spectrum would render it as\na grey scale: low amplitude variability would be black, and high amplitude\nwhite, with greys at intermediate values. With this translation, then, colors\nindicate that the shape of the spectrum differs from the ZW shape.\nThis would not work if we were to map the spectrum of low frequency (say\ninterannual) sea level variability on to the visible spectrum, as (according to\nZW), this spectrum is much less steep than \u03c3\u22122, so the resulting colors would\nall be towards the blue end of the color range (though still on the \u201cred\u201d side of\n\u201cwhite\u201d noise). Annual and semiannual signals are removed in our time series\nanalysis, which will produce a dip at the corresponding part of the spectrum,\nso to avoid any effect of this removal we chose to map the range of periods\n2\u201324 weeks onto the visible wavelength range of 380\u2013760 nm. This mapping\nmeans that low frequency variability (periods longer than semiannual) is not\nrepresented in the plotted spectrum, as the mapping results in this variability\nshifting to the invisible infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe picture which results from this remapping of the sea level spectrum\nis shown in Fig. 1a. There is a lot of information in this figure, so it is\nworthwhile to spend some time describing it in detail.\n5\nFigure 1: The spectrum of sea level variability presented as the color and brightness of the\nequivalent spectrum of light. The range of periods 2 weeks to 24 weeks is mapped to light\nwavelengths 380 to 760 nm (see Appendix A for a detailed description of this mapping). a)\nThe spectrum based on 12 years of altimeter data. b) Brightness as above, but with color\nderived from a simple spectral model in in which power is proportional to frequency to the\npower 0 at low frequencies and to the power -4 at high frequencies. The dividing frequency\nis 1.4 times the maximum allowed linear first baroclinic Rossby wave frequency, derived\nfrom the Rossby radius taken from the atlas of Chelton et al. [1998]. The scale bars show\ncolors (at all brightnesses) corresponding to spectra which are gaussian, as a function of\nperiod, with three different widths illustrated by the white curves, and the color of spectra\nin which power spectral density (as a function of frequency) is proportional to frequency\nraised to different powers.\n6\nFirst, in order to interpret the plot, note that there is both brightness\nand color information here. Brightness is related to the amplitude of sea\nlevel variability over the range of frequencies mapped, while color relates to\nthe shape of the spectrum. We chose the scaling with the idea that the ZW\nspectrum should be close to white or grey, and examples of the actual color\nof the ZW spectrum are given by the two greys which represent land and\nmissing data (mainly due to sea ice). The fact that the ocean region has no\noverall blue or red tint confirms that the ZW spectrum is a good first-order\nappoximation. Other colors do not have a simple one-to-one relationship with\nfrequency, just as they do not in light. For example, orange can be sodium\norange light at a particular frequency, or it can be a mixture of red and\nyellow light. There is thus no simple general interpretation of a given color,\nand it is impossible to provide a scale for this figure which gives quantitative\ninformation about amplitudes, or which covers the possible meanings of all\npossible colors. Rather, the figure should be interpreted as a qualitative guide\nto variations in amplitude (brightness) and shape (color) of the spectrum,\nwith some information about dominant periods of variability to be inferred\nfrom the color.\nSome more detailed guidance can be obtained by looking at the scale bars\nplotted at the bottom. These show the colors (at all different brightnesses)\nwhich would be produced by spectra of various different shapes. The first\nthree scales show the colors resulting from a Gaussian SPD (i.e. Gaussian\nas a function of period, not the PSD as a function of frequency), with var-\nious widths as shown by the curves drawn over the scales, and with peaks\nat various periods. The fourth scale shows the colors produced by different\npower-law spectra. Thus, as anticipated, a PSD in which power is propor-\ntional to \u03c3\u22122 (\u201cred\u201d noise) appears as approximately white or grey, with\nsteeper power laws (e.g. \u03c3\u22123 or \u03c3\u22124) appearing as a kind of brick-red color,\nand more gentle power laws (\u03c3\u22121 or \u03c30, which is \u201cwhite\u201d noise) appearing\nas quite a strong blue. This shows that simple power-law noise cannot be\nresponsible for many of the quite intense colors which appear in the figure,\nwhich must therefore mean that these colors indicate the presence of a peak\nin the SPD (though not necessarily in the PSD). More complicated spectra\ncan produce colors not in any of these scales. For example, a doubly-peaked\nSPD, with peaks near both short and long period ends of the range, would\nproduce a mixture of red and blue colors which may be responsible for some\nof the pink and purple regions seen in the figure.\nThe feature which immediately stands out in Figure 1a is the double\nrainbow pattern, in which the color starts as blue at latitudes of a few degrees\nnorth and south, and shifts through the colors of the rainbow to red at\nlatitudes of about 30\u25e6 north and south. This is visible in all ocean basins,\n7\nalthough less clearly in the Atlantic where variability is weaker, and is even\nquite clear in miniature in the South China Sea. This is the feature which was\nnoted by Lin et al. [2008], who explained it in terms of first mode baroclinic\nRossby waves. Such waves have a maximum possible frequency \u03c3 = \u03b2Ro\/2\nwhere \u03b2 is the northward gradient of the Coriolis parameter f , and Ro = c1\/f\nis the first baroclinic Rossby radius (c1 is the speed of first mode baroclinic\ngravity waves). Lin et al. [2008] find a close agreement between what they\ncall the peak in the sea level spectrum and this critical frequency as calculated\nfrom observation-based estimates of the Rossby radius. However, because\nthey integrate the spectrum over bins which are equally-spaced in period, the\npeaks they refer to are peaks in the SPD (plotted as a function of period), not\nthe PSD (a function of frequency). The PSD may simply display a change\nof slope at the reference frequency, rather than a peak.\nLin et al. [2008] explain this rainbow as the accumulation of Rossby wave\nenergy at the Rossby wave turning latitudes. However, while the linear the-\nory is clearly an important factor and Rossby wave dynamics do help explain\nthe observations, it is also clear that much of what is seen here is not linear\nwaves. For example, as Stammer [1997] pointed out, the bright blue stripes\nat about \u00b15\u25e6 in the Pacific, corresponding to a period of about 30 days, are\nthe signature of Tropical Instability Waves [Legekis, 1977; Qiao and Weis-\nberg, 1995]. Further south, the various brightly-colored stripes north of New\nZealand and east of Australia are the signature of eddies produced by insta-\nbility (mainly barotropic instability) of zonal jets in the region, producing\nperiods in the region of 70 days [Qiu and Chen, 2004; Qiu et al., 2009].\nTo investigate this further, we have plotted the colors which would result\nfrom this theory in Figure 1b. We calculated the shortest-permitted period\nfor first-mode baroclinic Rossby waves as T = 4pi\/(\u03b2Ro), where we take\nRo from the atlas of Chelton et al. [1998]. We then assumed a PSD more\nextreme than the ZW spectrum, with power proportional to \u03c30 at periods\nlonger than T , and proportional to \u03c3\u22124 at shorter periods (plotted as an\nSPD, this produces a symmetrically-peaked spectrum). The amplitude of\nthe spectrum was chosen so that the total power at periods shorter than 24\nweeks was the same as that in the observed sea level signal. As a result, Fig.\n1a shows colors given by the Rossby wave theory, but brightness from the\nobservations. In fact, we found that the predicted colors tended to be too red\nusing the pure theory, so the figure actually uses a reference period of T\/1.4\nrather than T . This is, to some degree, subjective, and different factors\nappear to work better in different regions, but the best value to choose is\nclearly somewhat smaller than T , but larger than T\/1.5.\nEquatorward of 30\u25e6 north and south, there is broadly a good match be-\ntween the figures, showing that Rossby wave theory is a useful first order\n8\ndescription of what is seen. However, the reduction of the chosen shortest-\npermitted period by a factor of 1.4, which is required to match the observa-\ntions, means that the observed peak in the SPD is at periods shorter than\nany allowed by the linear theory. This is consistent with the observation that\nmany of the regions of large variability are associated with instabilities. Both\nbarotropic and baroclinic instability processes, on a beta plane, are intimately\nassociated with Rossby wave dynamics, so it makes sense that Rossby waves\nshould play a role, but that nonlinear processes might permit the appearance\nof energy at periods prohibited by the linear dispersion relation. The Rossby\nwave model also leads to a rather smooth gradation of color in comparison\nwith the observations. This is also consistent with the idea that localized\ninstability processes are important over certain regions. However, some level\nof smoothness is inevitable, since the Rossby radius information is only pro-\nvided at a resolution of 1 degree. Overall, we have the impression (but can\nbe no more definite than that) that the required adjustment factor is larger\nin the most energetic regions, and smaller in the quieter regions, consistent\nwith the quiet regions being closer to linear wave dynamics. Our choise of\n1.4 for the adjustment factor is weighted towards being correct for the most\nenergetic regions, as these stand out most clearly (as they are brighter) in\nthe plot.\nEqually clearly, the Rossby wave interpretation breaks down at higher\nlatitudes. This is understandable, as linear Rossby wave speeds drop be-\nlow 1 cm s\u22121 poleward of about 40\u25e6[Chelton and Schlax, 1996]; , making\nadvective processes much more dominant at these latitudes and resulting in\nmuch stronger interactions with bottom topography, especially in the South-\nern Ocean (e.g. Hughes et al., [1998]). A similar argument was made by Le\nTraon [1991], who suggested that the increased high frequency energy in the\nGulf Stream region, which shows as the blue and white colors in our plot,\nis the result of energetic mesoscale turbulence, whereas the low-frequency\ndominated eastern North Atlantic (brown-orange-red in our plot) is closer\nto a linear wave regime. More recently, Tulloch et al. [2009] also came to\nthe conclusion that linear Rossby wave theory ceases to be a useful descrip-\ntion of the observations at latitudes polewards of about 30\u25e6, based on a fit\nof observations to Rossby wave dispersion relations and a scaling comparing\npropagation speed with eddy velocities.\nA particularly striking example of topographic influence occurs south of\nthe Antarctic Circumpolar Current at about 150\u25e6W, where two large, dark\nblocks of reddish and bluish color occur on the northern and southern flanks\nrespectively of the Pacific Antarctic Rise, the divide between red and blue\noccuring exactly at the ridge crest. This can be seen more clearly in Fig-\nure 2, which shows a section of Figure 1a replotted at a brighter level, with\n9\nFigure 2: Enlarged section of Figure 1a, shown six times brighter and with topographic\ncontours superimposed. Contours are at depths of 1, 3 and 5 km. The 3 km contour near\nto 150\u25e6W, 60\u25e6S represents the crest of the Pacific Antarctic Rise.\ntopographic contours overlaid for reference. Another high-latitude feature\nwhich stands out is the pair of milky bluish clouds which occur in the east-\nern North and South Pacific. These are large-scale barotropic modes driven\nby local wind stress [Fu, 2001], the bluish color being representative of the\ngreater high-frequency content in wind stress than is found in internally-\ndriven ocean processes at these latitudes; a third such region southwest of\nAustralia is masked by the high eddy variability found there. In principle,\nthese modes should be removed from the altimetry by the barotropic model\ncorrection applied by AVISO, but in practice this will only reduce the vari-\nability, not completely remove it.\nA similar signal is seen on the continental shelf regions, especially around\nthe UK and east of Argentina, but also on the New Zealand and Australian\nshelves, and the Canadian Atlantic shelf region. Variability in these regions\nhas a characteristic blue color, reflecting the dominance of atmospheric forc-\ning. A similar spectral plot of atmospheric pressure fluctuations, taken as a\nproxy for the vector wind stress (not shown) is uniformly blue with a latitude-\ndependent brightness. It is notable that the blue of the shelf seas and the\n(usually) redder color of the deep ocean are in many places separated by a\ndark line of low variability. This dark line is particularly clear around most\nof the Atlantic, but also around Australia, the South China Sea, and high\nlatitude Pacific regions. It invariably occurs near the steepest part of the\n10\ncontinental slope, and represents a decoupling of the deep ocean and shelf\nsea variability at these frequencies.\nConcern has been expressed that this \u201cdecoupling\u201d may be an artifact of\nthe altimeter data gridding process, especially as it often occurs close to land,\nand the altimeters are known to be less reliable (or even produce no data)\nclose to land. In order to test this in more detail, we have taken 10 years\nof TOPEX\/POSEIDON along-track data (364 cycles of 9.916 days each,\nstarting in October 1992) from the AVISO along-track corrected sea level\nanomaly dataset, downloaded from the same website as the gridded data. Ten\nshort sections of track have been identified which cross the continental slope\nin the Grand Banks and Argentine Shelf regions (Figure 3). Each section\nis approximately 480 km long (75 repeat-sampled points) and is centered on\nthe minimum variability in corrected sea level at periods shorter than 24\nweeks (17 cycles). The right-hand panel of Figure 3 shows how the standard\ndeviation of this high frequency sea level varies along each track section,\ntogether with the ocean depth (dashed lines). The minimum variability (at\nthe centre of each section) always occurs close to the continental shelf edge.\nTo see how the shape of the spectrum varies to either side of this mini-\nmum, we divided each track into five sections of equal length: sections one\nand two on the shelf, section three centred on the variability minimum, and\nsections four and five in deeper water. Spectra were then calculated as av-\nerages over all five tracks in each region, for each section (one to five) sepa-\nrately. The resulting spectra are shown in the left hand panels of Figure 3,\nwith dotted lines for the two shelf section, a solid line for the central (mini-\nmum variability) spectrum, and dashed lines for the two deep ocean sections.\nIn both regions it is clear that, in comparison with the central section, vari-\nability increases preferentially at high frequencies on the shelf, and at low\nfrequencies in deeper water, so the along-track analysis confirms the shift\nin spectral slope from steep (corresponding to red or white colors in Figure\n1a) in deep water, through a minimum of variability near the shelf edge, to\nshallow (blue in Figure 1a) on the shelf.\nThere are many other features which could be investigated in more detail,\nbut we will point out just two more. Off the Pacific coast of Central America\nthere are green-blue streaks. As noted by Chelton et al. [2004], these are\nregions of strong episodic wind stress and wind stress curl resulting from\nwinds blowing from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, being steered\nthrough the mountains, and presumably driving unusual ocean variability,\nalthough still close to the appropriate Rossby wave cut-off frequency. Finally,\nalong the Indian Ocean coast of southern Africa, and extending out to the\nsouth of Africa, there is a green-blue region, suggesting a dominant period\nof about 50\u201370 days. This pathway is consistent with the suggestion of\n11\nFigure 3: Along-track analysis of TOPEX\/POSEIDON altimeter data in the Grand Banks\nand Argentine Shelf regions. Panels on the left show the five sections of track from each\nregion, and sea level frequency spectra as an average across all five sections, but divided\ninto five equal-length regions along the length of each track. The solid line is averaged\nalong the middle sections of the five tracks (where sea level variability is minimum), the\ntwo dashed lines are spectra from the deep-ocean side of this minimum, and the two dotted\nlines from the shelf sea side. The right-hand panel shows topography (dashed) along each\ntrack section (tracks shown, top to bottom, in order from northeast to southwest), and\nroot-mean-square sea level variability (solid) at periods shorter than 24 weeks. The latter\nhas been normalized so that the largest value is the same for each section.\n12\nSchouten et al. [2002] that the shedding of eddies at the Agulhas retroflection\nis catalysed by the propagation of eddies down the African coast, producing\n4\u20135 eddies per year (which would be a slightly longer period of 73\u201391 days).\nIt can be seen that this plot synthesizes a lot of information about ocean\ndynamics, and initial tests (not shown) suggest that it would make a good\nmodel diagnostic, making it possible to quickly recognize processes and fea-\ntures which are being modeled well or badly. For our present purposes, how-\never, the main point is that the color, and hence the shape of the spectrum,\nvaries significantly and in some cases over rather short distances. Latitude\n(or Rossby wave cut-off frequency) is a good predictor of color in many of the\nlow-latitude deep-ocean regions, but outside these regions, and where par-\nticularly strong variability is encountered, there is no obvious way to choose\nregions over which the frequency spectrum will be homogeneous. If we are\nto build a model of the sea level spectrum, it must have quite a large degree\nof flexibility to be able to cope with these variations.\n3 Modeling the spectra\nThe one-parameter model (amplitude) of ZW certainly cannot fit the varia-\ntion of color of the spectrum, because such a model can only vary in bright-\nness. What we need is a multiparameter model, but it is not clear a priori\nhow many parameters are optimal. A way to address this problem is to\nuse the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of Schwarz [1978], which (un-\nder certain, rather weak assumptions required to find an analytical solution)\ngives a formula which balances the quality of fit against the number of fitted\nparameters in a manner which gives a Bayesian-optimal solution. The BIC\ndiffers from the related Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [Akaike, 1974] in\nthat the BIC penalizes additional parameters more strongly as the amount of\navailable data increases, although the two criteria approach the problem of\nmodel selection from quite different viewpoints. A useful discussion of these\nand related criteria can be found in Liddle [2007], who finds the BIC to be\nmore reliable. We actually tried both AIC and BIC and found that the BIC\nappeared to produce more stable estimates, with less spatial variability than\nthe AIC.\nTo vary the number of model parameters we use the family of autore-\ngressive (AR) spectral models which are capable of describing ever more\ncomplex spectra as the number of parameters increases. For example, the\norder 1 function AR(1) is a two-parameter model with one shape parameter\nand an amplitude, AR(2) has two shape parameters and an amplitude, etc.\nOne property of these models is that all tend towards a \u201cwhite\u201d spectrum\n13\nFigure 4: The order of the autoregressive model which is recommended by the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion at each point. The inset is a cumulative distribution function (as\npercentage of grid points) for the recommended order.\nat the low frequency extreme, which is a sensible null hypothesis for parts of\nthe spectrum which are unconstrained by the data.\nFor each time series, we apply the BIC to estimate the optimal order of\nAR model to fit. AR models are fitted to the time series using the least-\nsquares covariance method, which minimises the forward prediction error\n[Kay, 1988; Stoica and Moses, 1997]. Figure 4 shows the order predicted by\nthis procedure as a map and as a cumulative distribution function. It is clear\nfrom this that AR(1) and AR(2) are rarely sufficient (less than 7% of cases).\nAbout 81% of points recommend AR(3), AR(4) or AR(5), so AR(5) or less\nis sufficient for 88% of points. The spatial distribution of the optimal order\nshows interesting structure, particularly in the tropics. We might speculate\nthat some of the tropical regions requiring higher order fits represent regions\nin which multiple baroclinic modes play a significant role, but that remains\na question for future investigation.\nBased on this distribution, we choose to fit the time series everywhere with\nan AR(5) model. We do this rather than fit the optimal number of parameters\nat each point, in order to avoid sharp jumps in color at boundaries between\n14\nFigure 5: As for Figure 1a, but showing the colors resulting from a) AR(1) and b) AR(5)\nfits to the time series.\n15\nparameter numbers. This means that some spectra will be over-fitted, but\nthose will tend to be the smoother spectra for which over-fitting means that\nthe AR parameters themselves will be poorly constrained, while doing little\nharm to the shape of the spectral model. We illustrate the colors which result\nfrom both AR(1) and AR(5) fits in Figure 5.\nIt is clear that most of the color variation has been well captured by the\nAR(5) fit. Some of the reds near to\u00b130\u25e6 are less intense than the raw spectral\nplot, but most features are retained. There are suggestions of a decrease in\nstatistical noise in the colors, for example in the greater organization of colors\nin the region to the west and northwest of Hawaii, and in the more uniform\nblue-white color of the most energetic regions, although it is also possible\nthat some of these \u201cnoisy\u201d features from the raw colors are real, and are\nunderfitted by the AR(5) model.\nFigure 5a shows the spectra which result from an AR(1) fit to the time\nseries. This produces practically no color over most of the ocean, balancing\nout the steeper and shallower parts of the spectrum to produce something\nclose to \u03c3\u22122 behaviour, and showing that this 2-parameter model actually\nproduces colors similar to the 1-parameter ZW mode. An exception occurs\nin the regions where very high frequencies are most important, where some\nblue regions appear. Other AR models of order 2 to 4 produce more colorful\nplots (not shown), but it is not until AR(5) is used that the full rainbow\neffect is convincingly reproduced.\nIn order to illustrate the amount of structure in the actual and fitted spec-\ntra, we have selected 10 regions (labelled boxes in Figure 5b), over which the\ncolor suggests that it is meaningful to take a spatial average of the spectrum.\nFigure 6 shows the spectra averaged over these regions, and the correspond-\ning average AR(5) fitted spectrum. For reference, the boundary between\nshaded and unshaded regions in the figure represents the ZW spectrum at\narbitrary (constant) amplitude. The quality of fit is generally good, espe-\ncially in the highest energy regions 6, 7 and 8. The AR(5) fit correctly\ncaptures the shoulder in the spectra at periods shorter than 1 year, which is\nresponsible for much of the color seen in Figure 1, although in some cases\nthe raw spectra show a sharp local peak at that shoulder which the AR(5)\nmodel cannot capture. The model also captures fairly well the second, long\nperiod plateau and rise in boxes 1 and 2, which is a measure of the strong\ninterannual variability (including El Nin\u02dco) in the tropical Pacific. The case\nwhere the spectral structure is least well-fitted is box 10 on the Argentine\nShelf, which is a region where the BIC suggests almost half the points require\nAR orders of 7\u20139.\nThe shapes of the spectra are interesting. In most cases there is a clear\nshoulder, with the spectrum steeper than \u03c3\u22122 at higher frequencies (in boxes\n16\nFigure 6: Power spectral densities as a function of frequency, for spectra averaged over\nthe 10 boxes shown in Figure 5b. Dotted lines show the corresponding AR(5) fit to the\ndata. The shading covers the region above the line represented by the Zang and Wunsch\n[2001] spectrum, at an arbitrary chosen amplitude.\n3 and 4 it comes close to \u03c3\u22125 while the Agulhas box gives \u03c3\u22123), and flatter\nthan \u03c3\u22121\/2 at lower frequencies. This behaviour was behind our choice of\npower laws used in the Rossby wave model illustrated in Figure 1b. In the\nGulf Stream and the East Pacific (boxes 8 and 5) there is more of a smooth\ncurve than a sharp shoulder. The steep slope at high frequencies may be\npartly a result of the removal of some high-frequency barotropic variability,\nand partly a result of filtering by the mapping procedure. This is particularly\nlikely in boxes 5, 9 and 10, each of which are blue regions in Figure 1a. The\nshoulder in these regions occurs at frequencies higher than 10 cycles per year,\nas it does in box 1. Elsewhere, however, the steep spectral slope extends over\ntoo wide a frequency range to be entirely due to these effects.\nHaving settled on an AR(5) fit to the data, we now have model spectra\nat each point, which can be used to calculate meaningful statistical errors on\nsea level trends.\n4 Implications of spectral shape for trend es-\ntimates\nLeast-squares fitting of a linear trend to a time series with no true trend, but\nwith a spectrum of variability, will not usually produce zero trend. Given\na model of the spectrum, it becomes possible to determine the size of the\n17\nfalse trend estimate which can be expected to result from this estimation\nprocedure. This is an estimate of the statistical error in the fitted trend.\nIt is worth noting at this point a few limitations on what this estimate will\ntell us. First, it is purely statistical error, with no account taken of systematic\nerror due to instrument drift, which can only be constrained by comparison\nwith tide gauges to an estimated level of 0.4 mm\/yr globally [Leuliette et\nal., 2004]. Second, even if a trend is shown to be significantly above the\nstatistical error, that is no proof that it is a true secular trend. It simply\nshows that it is meaningful to interpret the trend as a significant component\nof the time series over the period of observations. There is nothing to say the\ntrend will not reverse given longer time series. Third, conclusions concerning\nsignificance of trends determined from longer time series are contingent on the\naccuracy of the spectral model at longer periods than those constrained by the\nobservations. The AR sequence of models extrapolates the spectrum at long\nperiods using a \u201cwhite\u201d noise model. Often, this will tend to underestimate\nstatistical errors, as most geophysical time series tend to be somewhat redder\nthan \u201cwhite\u201d noise. However, if the longest measured periods correspond to\na peak in the spectrum (as might be expected where El Nin\u02dco is the dominant\nsignal, since it typically shows peak variability at around 3\u20137 years), the\nspectral model will overestimate errors in longer time series.\nThe statistical error in trends will depend on the amplitude of variability,\nand also on the shape of the spectrum. If a single spectral shape were an\nadequate description of the ocean spectrum everywhere, then only amplitude\nwould matter, and statistical errors would be a constant multiple of the errors\ncalculated assuming the spectrum was \u201cwhite\u201d (i.e. that each point in the\ntime series is independent). In Figure 7a, we take the statistical error for a\ntrend fitted to the 12-year time series, as estimated from the AR(5) model at\neach point, and divide it by the error estimated using the equivalent \u201cwhite\u201d\nnoise model. This shows the importance of spatial variations in spectrum\nshape for the accurate estimation of trend errors. The ratio varies from less\nthan 1 in a few regions, to more than 5 in the tropical Pacific. Thus, using\neven the best compromise for the spectral shape will result in error estimates\nwhich are wrong by more than a factor of 2. Accounting for spectral shape\nvariation is important.\nIt is interesting that the tracks of the TOPEX\/POSEIDON and Jason\naltimeters are clearly visible in Figure 7a as regions which have a lower error\nratio than the surrounding ocean, particularly clearly in the South Pacific\nwhere they appear as green lines surrounding yellow diamonds. In our expe-\nrience, this is unusual for diagnostics based on this mapped product, which\nrarely show any evidence of \u201ctrackiness\u201d. It demonstrates that, even after\nthe gridding procedure, there is more information, and therefore a tighter\n18\nFigure 7: a) The ratio of statistical error in sea level trend over 12 years, estimated from\nthe AR(5) fit to the data, to the equivalent error assuming a white noise model. b) The\nlength of sea level time series which would be necessary for the statistical error in trend\nto reduce to 1 mm\/yr, based on the AR(5) fit to the time series at each point.\n19\nconstraint on trend estimates, along the more frequently sampled TOPEX\ntracks (the satellite return period is just under 10 days along these tracks,\ncompared with 35 days along the ERS\/Envisat tracks).\nIn Figure 7b we show the length of time series required for the statistical\nerror on trend to drop below 1 mm\/yr, a typical accuracy requirement for\ndistinguishing causes of regional patterns in sea level trends. This drops\nbelow 12 years only in the quietest regions of the ocean, including much of the\nAtlantic continental slope. Elsewhere, the estimate relies on extrapolation\nof the spectrum and is therefore more speculative. In many regions the time\nrequired is several decades (reaching a maximum of 101 years at a point in the\nKuroshio extension). Around the southern North Sea and English Channel,\nestimates vary between about 15 and 25 years, consistent with the 20\u201325\nyears implied by Figure 3 of Shennan and Woodworth [1992], who performed\nan empirical analysis of the scatter in observed trends from tide gauges in\nthis region. As we note above, the time may well be an overestimate in the\nEl Nin\u02dco region because the long period end of the spectrum may well be a\npeak (the counterintuitive result that this region appears blue in Figure 1a\nis because interannual periods are not reflected in this plot: they are not\nmapped to visible colors but to the infrared). The results are also broadly\nconsistent with Douglas [1991], who recommended the use of tide gauge time\nseries at least 50 years long for the estimation of meaningful global trends,\nand estimated a standard error of 0.1 mm\/yr for the mean rate calculated\nfrom an average of 21 tide gauge records with minimum length 60 years. We\nclearly cannot assess this in detail from our short time series, but the number\nappears to be of about the right size.\nWith a model for the spectrum at each grid point, we are now in a\nposition to calculate whether the observed trend at each point is statistically\nsignificant. In Figure 8, we plot the observed trend (based on a joint least-\nsquares fit of annual and semiannual cycles plus linear trend) over the 12-\nyear analysis period, and the trend minus its (quasi-) global average (area\nweighted), which is 3.0 mm\/yr. Superimposed on these plots are contours\nrepresenting the lines where the observed trend is equal to plus or minus\ntwo standard deviations of the estimated statistical error in trend. In other\nwords, values redder than the black contour are in the top 2.3% of the trends\nwhich would be expected by chance from the observed spectrum with no true\ntrend, and values bluer than the red contour are in the bottom 2.3%. We\nwill use this as our definition of a significant trend.\nWe see from Figure 8a, that significant positive trends are common, but\nsignificant negative trends are rare, the main exceptions being in the far\nnorthern Pacific, and south of South Africa. Around much of the North\nAtlantic coast the trend over this period is not significant. Put another way,\n20\nFigure 8: a) The trend in sea level over the chosen 12-year period starting in April 1995,\ncalculated by joint least-squares fitting of a linear trend plus annual and semiannual cycles.\nb) The sea level trend minus its global average. Each panel has contours superimposed\nwhere the trend is twice (black) or minus twice (red) the standard error in trend estimated\nfrom the AR(5) fit to the time series at each point.\n21\nFigure 8b shows that the difference of the trend from the global average is\nsignificantly negative around the north Atlantic coast, as well as a number\nof other regions.\nIt is interesting to compare Figure 8a with the tropical Pacific and Indian\nOcean trends derived from altimetry and tide gauges by Church et al. [2006].\nThe latter were calculated for a different period: 1993\u20132001, and give a\ncompletely different result, the main feature of which is a large sea level\nrise (faster than 15 mm\/yr) in the vicinity of Indonesia, and a fall along the\nequator east of the date line. The fact that the pattern is completely different\nin Figure 8a is consistent with the fact that none of the negative trends in this\nregion are identified as being statistically significant, and that the regional\ndifference pattern in Figure 8b is statistically significant over a rather small\npart of the tropics. These regions are subject to large interannual variability\nassociated with El Nin\u02dco and the Indian Ocean dipole, and the trends over\nless than a decade are unlikely to be representative of the long term.\nThe patterns in Figure 8b, which show the regional variations in trends, do\nnot look like those which would be expected from sea level fingerprint analysis\nto be associated with melting ice. For example, melting of Greenland ice\nwould produce a pattern of sea level rise which is negative over a region near\nto Greenland, stretching as far south as Nova Scotia and Ireland [Mitrovica\net al., 2001], and positive further south. The observed trend, while negative\nclose to Greenland, remains negative close to the coast out about 20\u25e6N, and\nbecomes positive far too quickly offshore. It seems clear that this signal is\nbetter interpreted as an ocean dynamical process, for which the difference\nbetween shallow and deep water is a much more natural boundary. Similarly,\nthe large, negative trend in the far northern Pacific is not a good spatial\nmatch to the fingerprint of Alaskan glacier melt, and is far too large to\nbe attributed to this source. A case could be made for decreasing sea level\naround Antarctica, with an increase elsewhere, but this is far from convincing.\nEqually the North Atlantic pattern is not very suggestive of the pattern\nassociated with changes to the Meridional Overturning Circulation. The\npattern identified by Ha\u00a8kkinen [2002] in deep water on the western side of\nthe basin is not prominent, and while the (relative) decrease in sea level on\nthe continental shelf is consistent with what Bingham and Hughes [2009]\nwould predict for a weak slowing of the overturning, it seems as large on\nthe eastern shelf as on the western shelf, counter to their expectations for\nsuch a mode. Although the patterns appear to be dynamical, they remain\nconsistent with the conclusion of Wunsch and Heimbach [2006] that there\nare small fluctuations rather than any indication of a wholesale change in\nthe overturning.\n22\nFigure 9: The time series and spectrum of the global-average sea level. The first 11 points\nin the time series, marked with crosses, are from a period during which there is a known\nerror in the altimeter boresight pointing. The part of the time series used in this analysis,\nand in the calculation of the spectrum, is marked by a thicker line. The spectrum is shown\nas in Figure 3, except that there is a factor of 1000 difference in the ordinate amplitude\nand shading.\n5 Spatial average sea level\nWe have, in this analysis, been considering the time series independently of\neach other. There is no simple way of taking the information thus gener-\nated to assess whether regional averages of sea level trends are statistically\nsignificant, as this depends also on the spatial covariances of the time se-\nries. Instead, a time series of the chosen regional average must be considered\n(with the region chosen on objective grounds, without reference to the ob-\nserved patterns), and that time series can then be subjected to the same\nanalysis as for any other single time series. An obvious example is the time\nseries of global-average sea level (actually averaged over the region for which\nthe time series is sufficiently complete as defined in Section 2, and with area-\nweighting of each grid point). We show this time series (with annual and\nsemiannual cycles removed), and the spectrum of the detrended time series,\nin Figure 9. The thick line in the left hand panel is the part of the time series\nused in this study. The first eleven points, marked with crosses, are from an\ninitial period of the TOPEX\/POSEIDON altimeter during which the altime-\nter boresight pointing error was anomalously large [Fu et al., 1994], and are\nclearly anomalous. The spectrum has been plotted on a scale three orders of\nmagnitude smaller than that used in Figure 6, reflecting the fact that vari-\nability about the trend is much smaller than at a typical single point in the\nocean.\n23\nFor the analysis period, the standard deviation of the global sea level time\nseries minus fitted trend is 2.50 mm. This small variability is the result of\ntwo processes. First, there is simple statistical noise reduction. This would\nhappen most effectively if each time series was independent of every other one,\nas the average of a large number of independent time series tends toward zero.\nThe second process is associated with spatial covariance. Change in global-\naverage sea level requires a change in the volume of the ocean, whereas the\nvariation at each grid point can be much greater as a result of redistribution\nof water with no net volume change. If the time series were all independent\n(except for a spatially-constant trend), then noise reduction would best be\nachieved by averaging the time series weighted inversely by the standard\n\u201cerror\u201d represented by the noise. If we do such an average, then we obtain a\ntime series with standard deviation (after detrending) of 3.83 mm assuming\n\u201cwhite\u201d noise, or 3.74 mm using our spectral estimate of the trend error at\neach point. From this it is clear the global average is reducing variability\nby more than just statistical averaging of noise, it is genuinely reflecting the\nfact that much of the variability is due to redistribution of volume.\nThe BIC, when applied to this spectrum, recommends the use of an AR(5)\nmodel of the spectrum. With such a model, we find that the time to 1 mm\/yr\naccuracy (one standard deviation) is only 107 weeks. Simultaneous fitting of\na trend plus AR(5) model to the time series results in a trend of 3.2 mm\/yr\nwith a standard error of 0.1 mm\/yr. This statistical error estimate is 3.5 times\nthe error estimate which would result assuming \u201cwhite\u201d noise, but remains\nsignificantly smaller than the true error, estimated from systematic effects\n[Leuliette et al., 2004] to be about 0.4 mm\/yr. Both trend and statistical\nerror are consistent with that reported by Cazenave et al. [2008] for the\n15-year period from the beginning of 1993 (3.1\u00b10.1 mm\/yr). It is also worth\nnoting that this is the trend of the raw time series, without any correction\nfor the effect of glacial isostatic adjustment on the volume of the ocean (the\nchanging shape of the ocean basins is such that, if the sea surface did not\nmove, the volume of water would be increasing at a rate equivalent to about\n0.3 mm\/yr of sea level rise [Peltier, 2001]).\n6 Summary and conclusions\nWe have investigated the shape of the spectrum of sea level variability based\non a homogeneous subset of 12 years of the AVISO gridded altimeter dataset.\nWe find that, while the spectrum proposed by ZW is a reasonable first order\ndescription of the average spectral shape, there are significant spatial vari-\nations in shape. These variations mean that errors in trend estimates are\n24\nnot simply related to the variance of detrended sea level time series, so the\nvariation in spectral shape must be explicitly accounted for when estimating\ntrends (or fits to any other chosen function of time).\nSpectra typically show very steep power laws at high frequencies (a few\nweeks to, usually, a few months), perhaps as steep as power proportional to\nfrequency to the power -5 in places. There is often a shoulder in the spectrum,\nsometimes a peak and sometimes a more gradual curvature, before it settles\nto a gentler power law at lower frequencies. In some places, the spectrum\nthen steepens again to an interannual peak. There are spatial variations\nin the amount of structure in the spectrum, as well as in the positions of\nthe break points and steepness of power laws, and we find that a fifth-order\nautoregressive model is necessary to capture the spectral structure over much\nof the ocean.\nA good visual representation of spatial variations in spectral shape and\namplitude can be presented (Figure 1) by exploiting the way the eye repre-\nsents spectral information as color, although only at relatively high frequen-\ncies which provide sufficient degrees of freedom. We limit this representation\nto periods shorter than 24 weeks for this reason. This shows a rainbow effect\nover latitudes equatorward of about 30\u25e6. While this is consistent with the\nsignificance of the baroclinic Rossby wave cut-off frequency, as suggested by\nLin et al. [2008], we argue that many of the energetic features giving rise\nto this rainbow have already been identified as instability processes, and are\ntherefore nonlinear effects, albeit with Rossby wave dynamics as an impor-\ntant component.\nThe visualization also emphasizes the complexity of spectra at higher\nlatitudes, and the difference between deep ocean and shelf seas. Shelf seas\ntypically have a bluer spectrum, indicative of the dominance of atmospheric\nforcing, and there is often a minimum of variance separating the different col-\nors of deep ocean and shelf seas, showing that deep ocean sea level variations\nare decoupled from coastal variations at these relatively high frequencies.\nTrends in sea level over the altimetry period show significant spatial varia-\ntions, which appear from their patterns to be of dynamical origin. Statistical\nsignificance of these patterns means that it is a meaningful exercise to use\nocean models and observations to determine the physical cause of these vari-\nations.\nAppendix: Converting spectra to colors\nThis Appendix summarizes how to go from a spectrum to a color displayed on\na monitor. The information here was mostly gleaned from Charles Poynton\u2019s\n25\nColor FAQ and Gamma FAQ documents hosted at http:\/\/www.poynton.com.\nThe first stage is to determine tristimulus values X, Y , and Z. These\ncan be considered to be the three numbers which completely specify a color\nand its brightness. Each number represents a weighted integral of the light\nspectrum, with Y in particular corresponding to the perception of brightness\nknown as luminance. The procedure for calculating these values will be\ndescribed at the end. For now, assume you have X, Y , and Z, and want to\nwork out how to display the corresponding color on a monitor, by sending it\nthree bytes corresponding to r, g and b values.\nThis is an inverse problem. You know the color you wish to achieve, and\nyou know (in principle) the colors of the three (red, green, blue) phosphors\nused by the display. The question is to find the brightnesses of each of\nthese (more precisely, the number to send to the software to produce the\nappropriate brightness) you need in order to produce the correct color. To\nwork this out, it is useful to work with an intermediate set of numbers R, G,\nB which are linear functions of X, Y , Z. These are conventionally specified\nsuch that R = G = B = 1 corresponds to white light at full brightness,\naccording to the monitor\u2019s chosen definition of white (this may actually be\nquite a bluish color). We now seek the matrix A such that\uf8eb\uf8ed XY\nZ\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 = A \u00b7\n\uf8eb\uf8ed RG\nB\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (1)\nSince A consists of 9 numbers, we need 9 independent pieces of information\nto determine it. However, the information (the colors of the three phosphors)\nneeded to work out X, Y , Z from R, G and B is conventionally given in a\nslightly strange form. The color of each phosphor is specified in terms of its\nchromaticity x, y, z = 1\u2212x\u2212y where x = X\/(X+Y +Z), y = Y\/(X+Y +Z),\nz = Z\/(X + Y + Z), which tell you about the color without luminance\ninformation (only x and y may be given as z can be derived from them), and\nrelative weights for the phosphors are specified by the chromaticity chosen\nto represent white. So we have chromaticities xr, yr, zr for red, xg, yg, zg for\ngreen, xb, yb, zb for blue, and xw, yw, zw for white, giving eight independent\nnumbers (because z = 1 \u2212 x \u2212 y). The final piece of information is the fact\nthat R = G = B = 1 gives white light with Y = 1. This is sufficient, after\nsome manipulation, to specify A, which can then be inverted to give the\nconversion from XY Z to RGB:\uf8eb\uf8ed RG\nB\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 = A\u22121 \u00b7\n\uf8eb\uf8ed XY\nZ\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (2)\n26\nAs an example (as used in the calculations in this paper), Poynton rec-\nommends the use of a standard he calls Rec. 709, for which\nxr = 0.640 xg = 0.300 xb = 0.150 xw = 0.3127\nyr = 0.330 yg = 0.600 yb = 0.060 yw = 0.3290\nzr = 0.030 zg = 0.100 zb = 0.790 zw = 0.3582,\n(3)\nwhich leads to\nA =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 3.2409699 \u22121.5373832 \u22120.49861079\u22120.96924375 1.8759676 0.041555082\n0.055630032 \u22120.20397685 1.0569714\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (4)\nand\nA\u22121 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0.41239081 0.35758433 0.180480810.21263903 0.71516866 0.072192319\n0.019330821 0.11919473 0.95053222\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (5)\nNote: this is our calculation, which differs from Poynton\u2019s in the 5th sig-\nnificant figure, perhaps because the white chromaticities given in (A3) are\ntruncated at 4 significant figures.\nInsertingXY Z into (A2) gives us the RGB values, but there is a potential\nproblem: what if one or more values is either negative or greater than 1? We\nwill consider how to fix negative values first, and then values greater than 1.\nIt may seem surprising that negative values can arise. The reason for this\nis that no three colors are sufficient to produce all possible colors. While\nthe XY Z values derived from any power spectrum must be positive, and\nthe transform from RGB to XY Z is bound to result in positive values, that\nis not the case for the inverse transform. Physically, what is meant by a\nnegative value for R (say) is that the target color cannot be matched using\nthe chosen set of three colors, but if some red was added to the target color\nthen a match could be found. The range of possible colors for a given set of\nred, green and blue chromaticities is called the gamut, so negative values are\nreferred to as an \u201cout of gamut\u201d error.\nSo, we have a color which cannot be displayed. What can we do about\nit? Our chosen option is to do as little damage as possible to the color and\nbrightness, but accept a reduction in saturation of the color. This is achieved\nby 1) adding just enough white (equal amounts of R, G and B) to remove the\nnegative value, and then 2) rescaling the luminance back to its original value\nby applying the same factor to R, G and B. This is achieved by calculating\n\u03b4 = \u2212min (R,G,B, 0). If \u03b4 > 0 then calculate fixed values R1, G1 and B1\nfrom\n(R1, G1, B1) = (R + \u03b4,G+ \u03b4, B + \u03b4)\nY\nY + \u03b4\n. (6)\n27\nNow we have to deal with large values. These could have been avoided by\nscaling everything at the beginning, but that is often not what is wanted as\nit can result in pictures which are dark except for very small regions. Given\nthat we are going to allow large values to occur, how should we rescale them\nfor display?\nThere are various options, depending on the application. In our pictures,\nwhere preserving color is more important than brightness, our preferred op-\ntion is to rescale R, G and B by dividing by the largest of the three, if the\nlargest is greater than 1. This means that brightness can be compromised,\nbut leaves meaningful colors at all points (meaning that white cannot occur\nas a result of over-saturation of the brightness).\nSo far we have been working in linear RGB. That means that images\ncan be added by adding the RGB components (before applying out of gamut\ncorrections and limiting the maximum), and the correct colors will result.\nHowever, for reasons of efficiency, it is usual for the monitor to have a non-\nlinear response to input numbers, with brightness being proportional to input\nnumber raised to some power \u03b3 (but with a linear tail added at low values).\nThis means that the inverse function must be applied to RGB to give the\nnonlinear R\u2032G\u2032B\u2032 which must be presented to the monitor. While the actual\nresponse usually has a \u03b3 of about 2.5, it is usual to extend the dynamic\nrange slightly by using a somewhat smaller \u03b3 for the inverse transform, the\nstandard value being 20\/9 = 2.22\u02d9, or 1\/\u03b3 = 0.45.\nThe inverse transform takes the form\nR\u2032 = hR R \u2265 Rc\nR\u2032 = fR1\/\u03b3 + g R \u2264 Rc, (7)\nwhere the coefficients are chosen so that R\u2032 = 1 where R = 1 and at the\nmatching value R = Rc = 0.018, the curve of R\n\u2032 against R is continuous and\nhas a continuous first derivative. This results in\nh = 4.506813168\ng = \u22120.09914989\nf = 1.09914989. (8)\nOnce this transform has been applied to give R\u2032G\u2032B\u2032 each in the range 0\nto 1, these can be linearly rescaled and converted into byte variables in the\nrange 0 to 255 to give the usual rgb values used in 24-bit color representation.\nThis is the final product, to be sent to the display.\nFinally, we return to the issue of how to determine the tristimulus values\nX, Y and Z. These are determined from the Spectral Power Distribution\n28\nFigure 10: The CIE 1931 color matching functions x, y and z.\n(SPD) function I(\u03bb), which describes the power emitted per unit area of the\nobject (illuminant) per nanometre of wavelength, as a function of wavelength\n(units W m\u22122 nm\u22121). This is convolved with the CIE 1931 color matching\nfunctions [CIE, 1971] x, y, z (also functions of wavelength) to give XY Z\nvalues, thus\nX =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nI(\u03bb)x(\u03bb) d\u03bb, (9)\nwith analogous expressions for Y and Z. The color matching functions are\ntabulated at 5 nm intervals, and are shown in Figure 10. A spectrum in\nwhich I is independent of wavelength gives a color quite close to white, and\nresults in equal values for X, Y and Z.\nThe input to this convolution is the SPD I(\u03bb) rather than the Power\nSpectral Density (PSD) S(\u03c3). The two can be related by noting that the\npower P between two wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is given by\nP =\n\u222b \u03bb2\n\u03bb1\nI(\u03bb) d\u03bb,=\n\u222b \u03c31\n\u03c32\nS(\u03c3) d\u03c3, (10)\nwhere, for light, \u03c3 = c\/\u03bb, so that \u03c31 = c\/\u03bb1 and \u03c32 = c\/\u03bb2. Noting that\nd\u03bb = \u2212c d\u03c3\/\u03c32, this allows us to identify that\nI = S\n\u03c32\nc\n. (11)\nWhen the spectrum is not light, but some other quantity (such as sea-\nlevel variability), the amplitude becomes rather arbitrary, and the speed of\nlight in (A11) is clearly no longer relevant. We use a periodogram PSD\n29\nestimate (normalized to be in units of m2\/Hz) multiplied by \u03c32 (frequency in\nHz) to obtain the equivalent of I, and then linearly rescale the chosen range\nof periods onto the 380\u2013760 nm range of the CIE color matching functions,\nbefore proceeding as for a light spectrum. The resulting values of XY Z are\nthen normalized for our plots, dividing by a factor of 1.6 \u00d7 106 (the factor\nis six times smaller for Figure 2). We also brighten the darker regions by\ndividing each of X, Y , Z by Y 0.2 (equivalent to raising luminance Y to the\npower 0.8 while keeping chromaticity constant), as this makes it possible\nto display a wider range of brightness. We have investigated the impact of\nsmoothing the PSD estimate, but it makes little difference to the final image.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Mark Tamisiea and Jo Williams for discussions and input during\nthe preparation of this paper.
