By comparing our estimates of the effective temperatures\nand the surface gravities of WD0833+194, WD0840+190, WD0840+205 and WD0843+184\nto modern theoretical evolutionary tracks we have derived their masses to be in the range\n0.72\u22120.76M\u2299 and their cooling ages\u223c300Myrs. For an assumed cluster age of 625\u00b150Myrs\nthe infered progenitor masses are between 3.3\u22123.5M\u2299. Examining these new data in the con-\ntext of the initial mass-final mass relation we find that it can be adequately represented by\na linear function (a0=0.289\u00b10.051, a1=0.133\u00b10.015) over the initial mass range 2.7M\u2299 to\n6M\u2299. Assuming an extrapolation of this relation to larger initial masses is valid and adopting a\nmaximum white dwarf mass of 1.3M\u2299, our results support a minimum mass for core-collapse\nsupernovae progenitors in the range\u223c6.8-8.6M\u2299.\nKey words:\nstars: white dwarfs; supernovae; galaxy: open clusters and associations: Praesepe\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe initial mass-final mass relation (IFMR) characterises the\namount of material stars with primordial masses M<\u223c10M\u2299 cast\nout into interstellar space during post main sequence evolution, en\nroute to becoming white dwarfs. Accordingly, the form of this rela-\ntion is of considerable importance to investigations relating to the\nchemical evolution of the Milky Way and galaxies in general. The\ndetails of the upper end of the IFMR also have relevance to su-\npernovae studies since theoretical predictions of the rate of these\nexplosions are rather sensitive to the assumed minimum mass of a\ncore-collapse progenitor. Furthermore, the form of the IFMR con-\nveys information on the mass loss processes which occur during\nthe final stages of stellar evolution, which are difficult to model in\na physical context.\nArguably the most robust method with which to place (semi-)\nempirical constraints on the form of the IFMR is via the study of\n\u22c6 E-mail: pdd@star.le.ac.uk\nwhite dwarfs in open clusters (e.g. Weidemann 1977, Romanischin\n& Angel 1980, Weidemann 2000). Since the constituents of an open\ncluster have a common age, determinable from the main sequence\nturn-off mass (e.g. King & Schuler 2005), the lifetime of a pro-\ngenitor star can be estimated from the difference between this age\nand the cooling time of the resulting white dwarf. Subsequently, the\nprogenitor masses can be determined by comparing their estimated\nlifetimes to the predictions of stellar evolutionary models.\nUnfortunately, until quite recently, the small numbers of WDs\nrecovered in each open cluster (\u223c30 WDs in 14 clusters), their in-\ntrinsic faintness and the significant distances involved has meant\nthat the uncertainties in clusters ages and in white dwarf mass de-\nterminations (and hence cooling time estimates), have conspired to\nproduce significant scatter in the semi-empirical IFMR (e.g. Claver\net al. 2001). Encouragingly, with time on 8\/10m class telescopes\nnow readily available, this situation is beginning to improve. For\nexample, Kalirai et al. (2005) and Williams et al. (2005) have spec-\ntroscopically identified 16 and 6 likely white dwarf members of the\nrich but relatively distant open clusters M37 and M35 respectively.\n2 P. D. Dobbie et al.\nFigure 1. The results of our fitting of synthetic profiles (thin black lines) to the observed Balmer lines, H-\u03b2 to H-8, (thick grey lines). The flux\u03bb units are\narbitrary.\nThese two populations of white dwarfs are found to be consistent\nwith a monotonically increasing IFMR for progenitor mass ranges\nM\u223c2.8-3.4M\u2299 and M\u223c4.5-5.5M\u2299, respectively.\nNevertheless, while significant additional pieces of the jigsaw\npuzzle have recently been put in place, much work remains to be\ndone before we are able to claim a thorough understanding of the\nIFMR. Accordingly, we recently embarked on a search for white\ndwarfs members of the modestly rich and relatively nearby Prae-\nsepe open cluster (M44, NGC2632). Using proper motions mea-\nsurements and photographic photometry drawn from the USNO-\nB1.0 catalogue and SuperCosmos archive we identified 6 new can-\ndidates in a 5\u25e6 \u00d7 5\u25e6 region centered on the cluster, to add to the\nfive previously known Praesepe white dwarfs. Futhermore, two of\nthese new candidates were confirmed spectroscopically. Full details\nof these objects are given in Table 1 of Dobbie et al. (2004).\nIn this work we present new low resolution optical spec-\ntroscopy which confirms that the four remaining candidates are also\nwhite dwarfs. Additionally, we use new data to provide refined esti-\nmates of the effective temperatures and surface gravities of LB5959\nand WD0837+218. We re-examine the membership status of each\nof these objects and present a new astrometric measurement of the\nhigh mass \u201cPraesepe\u201d white dwarf LB5893 which establishes that\nit has a proper motion which is consistent with cluster membership.\nWe discuss the implications of our findings in relation to the initial\nmass function of Praesepe and kinematic effects of mass loss in the\nfinal stages of the evolution of the white dwarf progenitors. Adopt-\ning an age of 625\u00b150Myrs for the cluster, we estimate the masses\nof these progenitor stars and examine our results in the context of\nprevious work on the initial mass-final mass relation.\n2 OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF THE REMAINING\nFOUR CANDIDATE WHITE DWARF MEMBERS\nWe have acquired optical spectra (3200-6000A\u02da) of the four re-\nmaining candidate white dwarf members of Praesepe from Dobbie\net al. (2004), using the William Herschel Telescope and the ISIS\nspectrograph. The observations were conducted during the service\ntime nights of 2005\/01\/10 and 2005\/11\/07 and the visitor night of\n2006\/02\/02. Sky conditions were good on the first and third nights\nwith clear skies and seeing \u223c0.7-0.9\u201d. On the second night there\nwas some thin and patchy cirrus and seeing was slightly poorer,\n\u223c1.0-1.2\u201d. All data were obtained on the blue arm of ISIS, using\nthe EEV12 detector, the R300B grating and a slit width of 1\u201d to\nprovide a spectral resolution of \u2248 3.5A\u02da. The total exposure time\nfor each object was 45 minutes made up from a series of 15 minute\nintegrations. The CCD frames were debiased and flat fielded using\nthe IRAF procedure CCDPROC. Cosmic ray hits were removed us-\ning the routine LACOS SPEC (van Dokkum 2001). Subsequently\nthe spectra were extracted using the APEXTRACT package and\nwavelength calibrated by comparison with the CuAr+CuNe arc\nspectra. To facilitate the removal of the instrument signature from\nthe science spectra we obtained observations of the spectral stan-\ndard stars PG0843+546 (Massey et al. 1988) and G191-B2B (Oke\n1990).\n3Table 1.

We have used the\nlatest versions of the plane-parallel, hydrostatic, non-local ther-\nmodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) atmosphere and spectral syn-\nthesis codes TLUSTY (v200; Hubeny 1988, Hubeny & Lanz\n1995) and SYNSPEC (v48; Hubeny, I. and Lanz, T. 2001,\nhttp:\/\/nova.astro.umd.edu\/) to generate a new grid of pure-H syn-\nthetic spectra covering the Teff and surface gravity ranges 10000-\n34000K and log g=7.0-9.0 respectively. We have employed a model\nH atom incorporating the 8 lowest energy levels and one superlevel\nextending from n=9 to n=80, where the dissolution of the high ly-\ning levels was treated by means of the occupation probability for-\nmalism of Hummer & Mihalas (1988), generalised to the non-LTE\nsituation by Hubeny, Hummer & Lanz (1994). All calculations in-\ncluded the bound-free and free-free opacities of the H\u2212 ion and\nincorporated a full treatment for the blanketing effects of HI lines\nand the Lyman \u2212\u03b1, \u2212\u03b2 and \u2212\u03b3 satellite opacities as computed by\nN. Allard (e.g. Allard et al. 2004). In contrast to the grid of mod-\nels used in our previous work where radiative equilibrium was as-\nsumed (Dobbie et al. 2004), these latest calculations include, where\nappropriate, a treatment for convective energy transport according\nto the ML2 prescription of Bergeron et al. (1992), adopting a mix-\ning length paramater, \u03b1=0.6. During the calculation of the model\nstructure the hydrogen line broadening was addressed in the fol-\nlowing manner: the broadening by heavy perturbers (protons and\nhydrogen atoms) and electrons was treated using Allard\u2019s data (in-\ncluding the quasi-molecular opacity) and an approximate Stark pro-\nfile (Hubeny, Hummer & Lanz 1994) respectively. In the spectral\nsynthesis step detailed profiles for the Balmer lines were calculated\nfrom the Stark broadening tables of Lemke (1997).\n3.2 Determination of effective temperatures and surface\ngravities\nAs discussed in Dobbie et al. (2004), comparison between the mod-\nels and the data is undertaken using the spectral fitting program\nXSPEC (Shafer et al. 1991). XSPEC works by folding a model\nthrough the instrument response before comparing the result to the\ndata by means of a \u03c72\u2212statistic. The best fit model representation\nof the data is found by incrementing free grid parameters in small\nsteps, linearly interpolating between points in the grid, until the\nvalue of \u03c72 is minimised. Errors in the Teffs and log g s are calcu-\nlated by stepping the parameter in question away from its optimum\nvalue and redetermining minimum \u03c72 until the difference between\nthis and the true minimum \u03c72 corresponds to 1\u03c3 for a given number\nof free model parameters (e.g. Lampton et al. 1976).\nGiven the probable age of the Praesepe cluster (\u223c600-\n700Myrs), a number of the white dwarf members may have ef-\nfective temperatures approaching that at which the H-Balmer lines\nreach their maximum equivalent width (Teff\u223c12500-13500K). Pre-\nvious spectroscopic studies of DA white dwarfs in this temperature\nregime indicate that the sensitivity to surface gravity of the equiv-\nalent widths of the lower order Balmer lines (e.g. H-\u03b2, H-\u03b3) is re-\nduced here (e.g. Daou et al. 1990). Therefore, in the present analy-\nsis all lines from H-\u03b2 to H-8 are included in the fitting process. Fur-\nthermore, given that we assign each line an independent normalisa-\ntion parameter, there is the potential for obtaining two solutions for\nTeff in this regime (e.g. Gianninas et al. 2005). Hence minimum \u03c72\nhas been approached from both the high and low temperature ends\nof the model grid.\nNo convincing fit with Teff613500K is found to any of the\ndatasets; the overall spectral shape of the data (ie. lines and contin-\nuum) are well matched by models at the temperature and surface\ngravity solutions determined here. The results of our fitting proce-\ndure are given in Table 1 and shown overplotted on the data in Fig-\nure 1. As a check for potential systematic errors (e.g. Napiwotzki\net al. 1999) we have validated the results with an independent anal-\nysis technique (FITSB2; Napiwotzki et al. 2004) and a different\nset of model atmospheres (the LTE atmospheres used by Koester\net al. 2001). Differences between individual results were found to\n4 P. D. Dobbie et al.\nFigure 2.

The region included our investiga-\ntion is outlined (dashed grey line). All objects listed in Table 1 of Dobbie et\nal. (2004; open circles) and the five \u2019original\u2019 white dwarf cluster members\n(open stars) are also overplotted. The locations of the four new spectro-\nscopically confirmed white dwarf candidate members are highlighted (open\ntriangles).\nbe well within the error limits quoted in Table 1 and no significant\nsystematic discrepancies were apparent. Nevertheless, it should be\nnoted that the parameter errors quoted here are formal 1\u03c3 fit errors\nand may underestimate the true uncertainties.\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 White dwarf membership status, the initial mass function\nof Praesepe and recoil kicks\nWe have used modern evolutionary tracks supplied by the Mon-\ntreal group (e.g. Fontaine, Brassard & Bergeron 2001) to determine\nthe masses and cooling times of our four new white dwarfs. We\nhave adopted the calculations which include a mixed CO core and\nthick H surface layer structure, which make this work consistent\nwith other recent studies in this area (e.g. Liebert et al. 2005a). The\nmasses and cooling times shown in Table 1 have been derived us-\ning cubic splines to interpolate between points in this grid. At the\npresent level of precision these mass determinations are not sensi-\ntive to our choice of core composition. However, if instead we had\nadopted thin H-layer models these estimates would be systemati-\ncally lower by 0.02M\u2299. Nevertheless, we can conclude that all four\nwhite dwarfs have masses which are significantly larger than those\ntypical of field white dwarfs, the distribution of which is found to\nbe strongly peaked at 0.565M\u2299 (e.g. Liebert et al. 2005b, Berg-\neron, Liebert & Fulbright 1995, Marsh et al. 1997). These com-\nparatively high masses and the projected spatial distribution of the\nwhite dwarfs (Figure 2) argue that our objects are associated with\nthe Praesepe open cluster.\nTable 2. Progenitor lifetimes and corresponding masses based on the\nwhite dwarf cooling times shown in Table 1, the Z=0.019 stellar evo-\nlutionary models of Girardi et al.

Only 2 objects\nin total have been flagged as candidate white dwarf members of\nPraesepe according to the selection criteria we applied in Dobbie\net al. (2004). There is no guarantee that spectroscopic data would\nconfirm either of these two objects to be a white dwarf. Thus we\nconclude that contamination by field white dwarfs is at a very low\nlevel.\nNevertheless, it is worth recalling here that LB5893, one of\nthe five \u201coriginal\u201d white dwarf members of Praesepe, was not re-\ncovered by our survey. Since Luyten (1966) measured a proper\nmotion of \u00b5\u03b1cos \u03b4=-34 mas yr\u22121, \u00b5\u03b4=-14 mas yr\u22121, albeit with\nlarge uncertainties, in Dobbie et al. (2004) we concluded that the\nUSNO-B1.0 astrometry of \u00b5\u03b1cos \u03b4=\u221256 mas yr\u22121, \u00b5\u03b4=\u221214 mas\nyr\u22121, may have been adversely affected by the proximity of the star\nKW195. Claver et al. (2001) previously reached a similar conclu-\nsion on finding that their proper motion measurement of this object,\nwhich relied on POSS-I plates for epoch 1, also failed to confirm\ncluster membership. Given the lingering uncertainties in the proper\nmotion of LB5893 and the rather peculiar location of this object\nin the semi-empirical IFMR (see Figure 11 of Claver et al. 2001),\nwe have used the POSS-II F band image (1989\/11\/08) and a V\nband image (2001\/02\/04) obtained from the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope archive at the Canadian Astrophysical Data Center to ob-\ntain a refined astrometric measurement for LB5893. Our estimate\nof \u00b5\u03b1cos \u03b4=\u221234\u00b19 mas yr\u22121, \u00b5\u03b4=\u221218\u00b112 mas yr\u22121 supports\nthe original proper motion determination of Luyten (1966) and ar-\ngues strongly that LB5893 is a member of Praesepe. Therefore in\nthe subsequent discussion we accept that the number of Praesepe\nwhite dwarfs is at least eleven.\nAs a consequence of the optical (O-E60) and near-infrared se-\nlection criteria (no 2MASS detection or blue) our survey is biased\nagainst the detection of white dwarfs in unresolved binary systems\nwith stars with masses M>\u223c0.1M\u2299 (spectral types earlier than M6-\n7). Thus in the context of the cluster simulations of Williams et\nal. (2004), in reflection, it seems more appropriate to compare our\nresults to the predicted observable number of single white dwarfs\n(ie. the predicted total observed number - the predicted number ob-\nserved in binaries). We find that the observed number is inconsis-\n5Figure 3. Initial mass-final mass for the white dwarf members of the Hyades (open triangles), Praesepe (black circles), M35 (open diamonds), NGC2516\n(open \u2019+\u2019s) and the Pleiades (open star). Sirius B is also shown (open circle). A linear fit to the data based on CO (solid line)\/C(dashed line) cores and the\nrelation of Weidemann (2000; dotted line) are overplotted.\ntent with these predictions, for any reasonable value of the maxi-\nmum mass of a white dwarf progenitor (Mcrit), if a steep power-\nlaw (\u0393=2) shape is assumed to describe the initial mass function\n(IMF) of Praesepe. In constrast, we find that the observed number\nis consistent with the results of the simulations if instead the IMF\nis assumed to have been Salpeter in form for any reasonable value\nfor Mcrit (P\u22480.19 for Mcrit=10M\u2299). Accordingly, we adjudge that\nthere is not a deficit of white dwarfs, at least single objects, in this\nopen cluster. If our conclusion is correct then these results suggest\nthat the bulk of Praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a significant re-\ncoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass\nduring the asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. Fellhauer et\nal. (2003) find that if the mean kick velocity extended to a white\ndwarf during this phase is greater than twice the cluster velocity\ndispersion (the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of Praesepe is\n0.67\u00b10.23kms\u22121; Madsen et al. 2002) then a significant fraction of\nthese objects evaporate from the cluster (>\u223c60% at 600-700Myrs).\n4.2 The masses of the progenitor stars of the Praesepe white\ndwarfs\nThe metalicities of the Praesepe and the Hyades open clusters\nare found, within uncertainties, to be very similar. For example,\nCayrel de Strobel (1990) and Boesgaard & Budge (1988) determine\n[Fe\/H]=0.10\u00b10.06 and [Fe\/H]=0.13\u00b10.07 respectively for the for-\nmer, while Cayrel, Cayrel de Strobel & Campbell (1985) and Per-\nryman et al. (1998) find [Fe\/H]=0.12\u00b10.03 and [Fe\/H]=0.14\u00b10.05\nrespectively, for the latter. Furthermore, it has been recognised for\ndecades that the space motions of the two clusters are comparable\n(e.g. Schwarzchild & Hertzsprung 1913, Eggen 1992, Madsen et\nal. 2002), leading to the suggestion that Praesepe is a member of a\nHyades supercluster. If this is the case it is likely that the ages of\nthe two clusters are similar.\nThe bulk of determinations place the age of the Hyades cluster\nin the range 500-900Myrs (e.g. Barry et al. 1981, Kroupa 1995).\nPerryman et al. (1998) have estimated an age of 625\u00b150Myrs\nby fitting theoretical isochrones, which included a treatment for\nconvective overshoot, to the Hipparcos-based cluster Hertzsprung-\nRussell diagram. Claver et al. (2001) have compared modern the-\noretical isochrones for ages 500, 700 and 1000Myrs to the Prae-\nsepe sequence as observed in their V,V-I colour-magnitude dia-\ngram. They conclude that the upper main sequence is poorly repro-\nduced by the 1000Myr isochrone but can be considered consistent\nwith either of the two younger models. In addition, recent work on\nthe X-ray properties of solar type Praesepe members reveals that\nthese are similar to those of the F and G stars of the Hyades (Fran-\nciosini et al. 2003). Furthermore, we note that the most detailed\nstudy to date of the spatial distribution and dynamics of the cluster\n(Adams et al. 2002) finds no evidence for the existence of a sub-\ncluster as suggested by Holland et al. (2001). Therefore, we follow\nClaver et al. (and more recently Ferrario et al. 2005) and in our\nsubsequent discussion assume the age of Praesepe is 625\u00b150Myrs.\nWe have derived the lifetime of the progenitor star of each of\nthe four new white dwarf members by subtracting the estimated\ncooling time, shown in Table 1, from the adopted cluster age. The\nresults of this process are shown in Table 2. For consistency, we ob-\ntained new spectroscopy of comparable quality for WD0837+218\n6 P. D. Dobbie et al.\nand WD0837+185 (Figure 1) and analysed it using our new grid of\nmodel atmospheres. Thus we also provide in Tables 1 and 2, revised\neffective temperatures, surface gravities, masses, cooling times and\nprogenitor lifetimes for these two objects. We note that the bulk\nof the discrepancy between the new and old parameter estimates\nfor these two objects stems from the different datasets used in the\ntwo analyses. The spectral datasets in Dobbie et al. (2004) were\nof comparatively low quality and the true level of uncertainty in\nthe associated effective temperature and surface gravity estimates\nappears to have been slightly underestimated by our formal error\nanalysis.\nSubsequently, we have used cubic splines to interpolate be-\ntween the lifetimes calculated for stars of solar composition by Gi-\nrardi et al. (2000) and have constrained the masses of these six pro-\ngenitors to the values shown in Table 2. The quoted errors take into\naccount the uncertainty in the cluster age. The locations in initial\nmass-final mass space of all six of these objects and the five orig-\ninal Praesepe white dwarfs, where their masses, cooling times and\nprogenitor lifetimes and progenitor masses have been derived on\nthe basis of the effective temperature and surface gravity measure-\nments of Claver et al. (2001), are shown in Figure 3 (filled circles).\nWe point out that five of the Praesepe white dwarfs virtually sit on\ntop of each other in this plot.\n4.3 The initial mass-final mass relation\nSince the Hyades has a comparatively robust age determination we\nhave added to Figure 3 the seven single white dwarf members of\nthis cluster (open triangles). Their initial and final masses are de-\nrived from the effective temperature and surface gravity measure-\nments listed in Claver et al. (2001). As there still appears to be\nconsiderable uncertainty as to the age of M37 (e.g. Kharchenko et\nal. 2005, Kalirai et al. 2005, Twarog et al. 1997), we do not include\nin Figure 3 recent data from this cluster. However, the eighteen\nwhite dwarfs from Praesepe and the Hyades only define the ini-\ntial mass-final mass relation for 2.7M\u2299<\u223cMprog<\u223c4M\u2299. Therefore,\nwe have also added to this plot Sirius B (open circle; Liebert et al.\n2005a) and the white dwarf members of three other relatively well\ncharacterised but much younger open clusters (\u03c4<\u223c200Myrs), the\nPleiades (open star), M35 (open diamonds; Williams et al. 2005)\nand NGC2516 (open \u2019+\u2019s; Koester & Reimers 1996).\nUsing a new high S\/N spectrum obtained with the WHT and\nour grid of TLUSTY models we have redetermined the effec-\ntive temperature and surface gravity of the only known Pleiades\nwhite dwarf WD0349+247 (LB1497) to be Teff=32841+175\u2212169 and\nlog g=8.63+175\u2212169 respectively (Figure 4). This corresponds to a mass\nof 1.02\u00b10.02M\u2299, in excellent agreement with the gravitational\nredshift determination (1.02\u00b1+0.04\n\u22120.05M\u2299; Wegner et al. 1991). For\nthe white dwarf members of M35 and NGC2516 we adopt the ef-\nfective temperatures and surface gravities listed in Table 1 of Fer-\nrario et al. (2005). Excepting M35, where, given the result of Kali-\nrai et al. (2003), we prefer an age of 160\u00b125Myrs, the progenitor\nmass for each of these white dwarfs is derived assuming the sys-\ntem\/cluster age and metalicity adopted by Ferrario et al. (2005).\nThe upper limits to the progenitor masses of the white dwarf mem-\nbers of NGC2516 and the Pleiades displayed in Figure 3 have been\ndetermined by supplementing the model grid of Girardi with an\nevolutionary calculation for a 9M\u2299 star drawn from a grid of a pre-\nvious generation of the Padova models (Bressan et al. 1993).\nAn examination of the thirty stars in Figure 4 indicates that the\nmajority appear to follow rather closely a monotonic relation be-\ntween their initial and final masses. Indeed, the white dwarf mem-\nFigure 4. The results of our fitting of synthetic profiles (thin black lines) to\nthe observed Balmer lines of WD0349+247, H-\u03b2 to H-8, (thick grey lines).\nThe flux\u03bb units are arbitrary.\nbers of the subsolar metalicity cluster M35 ([Fe\/H]\u2248-0.3; Sung &\nBessell 1999) seem to form a natural extension of the relation de-\nfined by the Hyades and Praesepe white dwarfs (see Figure 3). This\nsuggests that any effect metalicity may have on the form of the\nIFMR is probably not detectable at our current level of precision.\nNevertheless, two stars, both attributable to Praesepe, appear to de-\nviate more significantly (>\u223c3\u03c3) from the general relation (LB5893\nand WD0837+218). As briefly discussed by Claver et al. (2001)\nand Dobbie et al. (2004) these white dwarfs appear to be too hot\nfor their relatively high masses. We note here that their masses\nare coincident with the secondary peak in the mass distribution of\nwhite dwarfs (>0.8M\u2299; see Figure 13 of Liebert et al. 2005b). As\ndiscussed by Liebert et al. it has been suggested that a significant\nproportion of the white dwarfs in this secondary peak may be the\nprogeny of close binary systems.\nThe initial mass-final mass data shown in Figure 3 can be\nreasonably approximated by a linear function. In deriving the co-\nefficients for this we exclude the two objects which appear to de-\nviate most strongly from the general relation as these most likely\nresult from close binary evolution. Additionally, we choose to re-\nject from the our fit the magnetic white dwarf EG61 as the true\nuncertainties in the effective temperature and surface gravity deter-\nminations for this star, obtained from the Zeeman split profiles of\nthe Balmer lines, could be significantly larger than the formal er-\nrors quoted by Claver et al. (2001). Thus performing a linear least\nsquares fit to the remaining twenty-seven white dwarfs we derive\nfit co-efficients a0=0.289\u00b10.051, a1=0.133\u00b10.015 (solid line). We\nnote that had we adopted pure-C core white dwarf evolutionary\nmodels, the cooling times would have been systematically larger\nby between 5-30Myrs, resulting in shorter progenitor lifetimes,\nlarger progenitor masses and a marginally flatter IMFR (a0=0.304,\na1=0.127; dashed line). In either case our fit is somewhat steeper\nthan the widely applied Weidemann (2000) relation, in particular at\nMprog>\u223c4M\u2299 where the latter flattens slightly (dotted line).\nIn standard stellar evolutionary theory, the CO core of an in-\ntermediate mass star can grow to \u223c1.1M\u2299 before the carbon ig-\nnites. The resulting degenerate NeO core collapses, through elec-\ntron capture onto Ne, to form a neutron star. Extrapolating our fit to\nthe initial mass-final mass data we find that a 1.1M\u2299 white dwarf\nis produced by a star with an initial mass of \u223c6.1M\u2299. However,\nmore recent theoretical modelling by Garcia-Berro et al. (1997)\nhave shown that it is possible for stable more massive NeO de-\n7generate cores to form via single star evolution. For example, their\ncalculation of the evolution of a 10M\u2299 star ends in the production\nof a 1.26M\u2299 NeO white dwarf. However, a 1.37M\u2299 degenerate\nNeO core produced in a similar computation for a more massive\nstar collapses, resulting in a type II supernova explosion. These\nfindings led Weidemann (2000) to suggest that the upper limit for\na white dwarf mass is \u223c1.3M\u2299. On the basis of an extrapolation\nof our fit this corresponds to progenitor masses of 7.6(6.8-8.6)M\u2299 ,\nsomewhat lower than the 10-11 M\u2299 suggested by the models of\nGarcia-Berro et al. (1997).\nThere is no observational evidence to indicate that the form of\nthe IMFR can be represented by an extrapolation of our linear func-\ntion for Mprog>\u223c6M\u2299. Nevertheless, if we were to assume that such\nan extrapolation is valid and that the maximum white dwarf mass\nis 1.3M\u2299 then these results argue that the minimum mass of a core\ncollapse supernova progenitor lies in the range \u223c6.8-8.6M\u2299. We\nnote that Ratnatunga & van den Bergh (1989) estimate a Galactic\ntype II supernova rate of 1.1+1.5\n\u22120.6 century\n\u22121 for a minimum progen-\nitor mass of 8M\u2299.\n5 SUMMARY\nWe have spectroscopically confirmed four more white dwarf mem-\nbers of Praesepe and argued that there are at least eleven white\ndwarfs in this cluster. We find that this number is consistent with\nthat expected if the initial mass function of Praesepe was Salpeter\nin form. We suggest that this consistency indicates that few white\ndwarfs have evaporated from the cluster since their formation. If\nthis is correct then any recoil velocity kick arising from possible\nasymmetries in mass loss during the final stages of stellar evo-\nlution is likely smaller than \u223c2.5kms\u22121. We find most stars ap-\npear to follow, relatively closely, a monotonic relation between\ntheir initial and final masses. This relation can be reasonably ap-\nproximated by a linear function with coefficients a0=0.289\u00b10.051,\na1=0.133\u00b10.015. Extrapolation of this linear function beyond ini-\ntial masses \u223c6M\u2299 supports a minimum mass for a type II super-\nnova progenitor in the range \u223c6.8-8.6M\u2299 for an assumed maxi-\nmum white dwarf mass of 1.3M\u2299.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPDD is a PPARC postdoctoral research associate.
