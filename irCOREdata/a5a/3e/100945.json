INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, physics of quantum ratchets draw a\ngrowing attention. In mechanics, a ratchet is a device\nthat is used to restrict motion in one direction while per-\nmitting it in another. In general, one means by a ratchet\nany sort of asymmetric potential, or a potential lacking a\ncenter of the spatial inversion. At the turn of 1980\/90\u2019s\nit was understood that unbiased nonequilibrium noncen-\ntrosymmetric systems can generate transport of particles,\nand this conception has roots in different fields of physics,\nchemistry and biology. In mechanical, electronic, opti-\ncal and biological systems, a particle, classical or quan-\ntum, charged or neutral, propagating in a periodic poten-\ntial with broken centrosymmetry and subjected to an ac\nforce exhibits a net dc macroscopic flow. Examples are\nelectrons in solids, Abrikosov vortices in superconductors\nand biological motor proteins.1 One of implementations\nof the ratchet phenomenon is a Linear Photo-Galvanic\nEffect (LPGE). It represents a generation of a dc electric\ncurrent under absorption of linearly polarized light in un-\nbiased crystals of piezoelectric classes. Glass et al.2 were\nthe first to attribute a photoinduced current observed in\nferroelectric LiNbO3 to a novel photogalvanic effect and\npropose the first correct model for its microscopic qual-\nitative interpretation. A consistent quantitative theory\nof LPGE was developed by Belinicher and Sturman fol-\nlowed by other theorists, see Refs. 3,4.\nNoncentrosymmetric bulk semiconductors and het-\nerostructures are natural quantum ratchets and the fur-\nther studies of LPGE in these systems allow one to eluci-\ndate the whole problem of the ratchet effect. In particu-\nlar, a current of the LPGE consists of two contributions,\nballistic and shift, which as a rule are comparable in the\norder of magnitude.5 It is important to note that simi-\n\u2217e-mail: sergey.ganichev@physik.uni-regensburg.de\nlar two contributions to the electric current, called the\nskew-scattering and side-jump currents, do exist in the\nanomalous Hall effect, see the recent review by Sinitsyn.6\nAnother important point is that one should include into\nthe light absorption process contributing to the ballis-\ntic current an additional simultaneous scattering from\na static defect or a phonon, as compared to the light-\ninduced optical transition leading to the shift current.\nIn GaN-based structures first observation of LPGE has\nbeen reported quite recently.7,8,9,10,11,12 Here we present\nresults of detailed experimental and theoretical investi-\ngation of LPGE in heterostructures based on GaN and\nits alloys with AlN. The commercial fabrication of blue\nand green LEDs have led to well established technological\nprocedures of epitaxial preparation of these heterostruc-\ntures and initiated a great activity on investigations of\ntheir properties.13 The photogalvanics serves as a solid\nbridge between transport and optics and, therefore, re-\nveals both transport and optical properties of the systems\nunder study.\nII. SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL\nMETHODS\nThe experiments are carried out on (0001)-oriented\nwurtzite n-GaN\/Al0.3Ga0.7N heterojunctions grown by\nMOCVD on C-plane sapphire substrates (for details of\ngrowth see Ref. 7). The thickness of the AlGaN layers\nwas varied between 30 nm and 100 nm. An undoped\n33 nm thick GaN buffer layer grown under a pressure of\n40 Pa at temperature 550\u25e6C is followed by an undoped\nGaN layer (\u223c 2.5 \u00b5m) grown under 40 Pa at 1025\u25e6C; the\nundoped Al0.3Ga0.7N barrier was grown under 6.7 Pa at\n1035\u25e6C. The mobility and density in the two-dimensional\n(2D) electron gas measured at room temperature are\n\u00b5 \u2248 1200 cm2\/Vs and Ns \u2248 1013 cm\u22122, respectively.\nTo measure the photocurrent two pairs of contacts are\ncentered at opposite sample edges with the connecting\n2FIG. 1: Photocurrent as a function of angle \u03b1 measured at\nroom temperature at oblique incidence (\u03b80 = 15\n\u25e6) in the\na) longitudinal (Jx) and b) transverse (Jy) geometries. Pho-\ntocurrent is excited by linearly polarized radiation with wave-\nlength \u03bb = 148 \u00b5m and power P \u2248 5 kW. Full lines are fits\nto Eqs. (6). To get agreement with experiments we used one\nfitting parameter J0 \u221d \u03c7 and introduced an offset Joffset for\nthe current Jx detected in the direction of light propagation.\nThe inset shows the experimental geometry. An additional\ninset in the lower panel displays the sample and the radiation\nelectric field viewing from the source of radiation side.\nlines along the axes x \u2016 [11\u00af00] and y \u2016 [112\u00af0], see inset\nin Fig. 1. The current generated by the light in the un-\nbiased samples is measured via the voltage drop across a\n50 \u2126 load resistor in a closed-circuit configuration. The\nvoltage is recorded with a storage oscilloscope.\nThe photocurrents were induced by indirect intrasub-\nband (Drude-like) optical transitions in the lowest size-\nquantized subband. The emission from a terahertz (THz)\nmolecular laser optically pumped by a TEA CO2 laser\n14\nis used for the optical excitation. With NH3, D2O and\nCH3F as an active media we could obtain radiation pulses\nof duration \u2243100 ns with wavelengths \u03bb = 77, 90.5, 148,\n280, 385 and 496 \u00b5m and a power P \u2243 5 kW. Radia-\ntion in both the normal- and oblique-incidence geome-\ntries were applied with the angle of incidence \u03b80 varying\nfrom \u221230\u25e6 to +30\u25e6, \u03b80 = 0 corresponding to the normal\nincidence, and laser beam lying in the (xz) plane, see\ninsets in Figs. 1, 2 and 4.\nOptically pumped molecular lasers emit linearly polar-\nized radiation with the polarization plane determined by\nthat of the pump light: the electric field vector of the\nTHz radiation El generated by the molecular laser can\nbe either parallel (like for the lines \u03bb = 90.5, 148 and\n280 \u00b5m) or orthogonal (lines 77, 385 and 496 \u00b5m) to the\npolarization vector of the pump beam depending on the\nFIG. 2: Photocurrent as a function of angle of incidence \u03b80\nmeasured at room temperature in the transverse geometry\nand azimuth angle \u03b1 = 45\u25e6. Photocurrent is excited by radi-\nation with wavelength \u03bb = 148 \u00b5m and power P \u2248 5 kW. Full\nline is the fit to Eqs. (6) with the same fitting parameter J0\nas used in Fig. 1. The inset shows the experimental geometry.\nangular momentum selection rules for the pump and the\nTHz transitions in the active media.14\nIn the experiments the plane of polarization of the ra-\ndiation incident on the sample was rotated applying \u03bb\/2\nplates which enabled us to vary the azimuth angle \u03b1 from\n0\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 covering all possible orientations of the electric\nfield component in the (xy) plane. Hereafter the angle\n\u03b1 = 0 is chosen in such a way that the incident light po-\nlarization is directed along the y \u2016 [112\u00af0] direction, see\ninset in Fig. 1(b).\nTo investigate the photogalvanic effects we also use el-\nliptically polarized light. In this case the polarization\nof the laser beam is modified from linear to elliptical by\nmeans of crystal quartz \u03bb\/4 plates. The counterclockwise\nrotation (viewing from the laser side) of the optical axis of\nthe quarter-wave plate by the angle \u03d5p results in the vari-\nation of the radiation helicity as Pcirc = \u2212 sin 2\u03d5p. Here\nthe angle \u03d5p = 0 is chosen for the position of the quarter-\nwave plate optical axis coinciding with the incoming laser\npolarization, in which case the linear polarization degree\nis given by fourth harmonics of \u03d5p.\nA series of measurements is carried out making use\nof the frequency tunability and short pulse duration of\nthe free electron laser \u201cFELIX\u201d at FOM-Rijnhuizen in\nthe Netherlands operated in the spectral range between\n70 \u00b5m and 120 \u00b5m.15 The output pulses of light from\nthe FELIX were chosen to be \u2248 6 ps long, separated by\n40 ns, in a train (or \u201cmacropulse\u201d) of 7 \u00b5s duration. The\nmacropulses had a repetition rate of 5 Hz.\n3III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIrradiating the (0001)-grown GaN\/AlGaN heterojunc-\ntion by polarized light at oblique incidence, as sketched\nin the inset to Fig. 1(a), causes a photocurrent signal\nmeasured across a contact pair. The width of the pho-\ntocurrent pulses is about 100 ns which corresponds to\nthe THz laser pulse duration. The signal depends on\nthe light polarization, and all characteristic polarization\nproperties persist from 4.2 to 300 K. The experimental\ndata presented below are obtained at room temperature.\nThe effect is observed for all the wavelengths applied (be-\ntween 77 \u00b5m and 496 \u00b5m). We use two geometries: the\nlongitudinal geometry (Jx in the Fig. 1), in which the\nphotocurrent is measured in the direction along in-plane\ncomponent e\u02c6\u2016 and the transverse geometry (Jy in the\nFig. 1), where the signal is detected in the direction nor-\nmal to the light propagation unit vector e\u02c6 [see the inset\nin Fig. 1(a)].\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of the photocurrent\non the azimuth angle \u03b1 for both experimental geome-\ntries obtained at the positive incidence angle \u03b80 = 15\n\u25e6\nand e\u02c6\u2016 \u2016 x. The polarization dependence of the cur-\nrent in the longitudinal geometry is well fitted by Jx =\nJ0(1\u2212 cos 2\u03b1) + Joffset while for the transverse geometry\nwe have Jy = \u2212J0 sin 2\u03b1. Note that the offset contribu-\ntion Joffset is observed in the longitudinal geometry only.\nBelow, in Sec. IV.B, we will demonstrate that exactly\nthese dependences follow from the theory. As a function\nof the incidence angle the photocurrent changes sign at\n\u03b80 \u2248 0. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 which shows the\ndependence Jy(\u03b80) for the fixed azimuth angle \u03b1 = 45\n\u25e6.\nA similar dependence is also detected for the longitudi-\nnal current Jx. We note that, like the polarization de-\npendent contribution to the photocurrent, the detected\noffset current in the longitudinal geometry Joffset inverts\nits direction when the incidence angle changes its sign.\nThe wavelength dependence of the photocurrent ob-\ntained in transverse geometry at azimuth angle \u03b1 = 135\u25e6\nand angle of incidence \u03b80 = 15\n\u25e6 is shown in Fig. 3. The\ndata are measured both on FELIX (dots) and on molec-\nular laser (triangles). Fitting the data to the well known\nspectral behavior of the Drude absorption16,17\nJy(\u03c9) \u221d \u03b7(\u03c9) \u221d 1\n1 + (\u03c9\u03c4p)2\n(1)\nwe obtain that the spectral behavior of the photocur-\nrent can reasonably be described by this equation (see\nfull line in Fig. 3). For the fit we used \u03c4p as an ad-\njustable parameter and scaled the whole dependence by\nthe ordinate. Analyzing this dependence we obtained\nthat the momentum relaxation time controlling absorp-\ntion is about 0.05 ps. This value is twice shorter than\nthe transport time (\u2243 0.1 ps) extracted from the mo-\nbility measurements at room temperature. We attribute\nthe shortening of the momentum relaxation time by elec-\ntron gas heating due to absorption of the intense THz\nradiation. The reduction of the mobility due to heating\n \n \nFIG. 3: Spectral dependence of the transverse photocur-\nrent Jy measured at room temperature at oblique incidence\n(\u03b80 = 15\n\u25e6) for azimuth angle \u03b1 = 135\u25e6. The data are ob-\ntained with the free electron laser FELIX (dots) and with\nmolecular optically pumped laser (triangles). Full line shows\nfit to Eq. (1). The fit is obtained using \u03c4p as an adjustable\nparameter and a scaling the whole dependence by the ordi-\nnate. Dashed line shows Jy \u221d \u03c9\n\u22122 for comparison. The inset\nin the left upper corner shows the temporal structure of the\ncurrent in response to the radiation of FELIX. The inset in\nthe right corner shows the temperature dependences of the\ncarrier density and the mobility.\nstems from enhancement of scattering by phonons under\nincrease of temperature. Using short 6 ps pulses of FE-\nLIX we observed that the response time is determined\nby the time resolution of our set-up but it is at most\n100 ps or shorter (see the inset in the left upper corner of\nFig. 3). This fast response is typical for photogalvanics\nwhere the signal decay time is expected to be of the or-\nder of the momentum relaxation time3,4,14 being in our\nsamples at room temperature of the order of 0.1 ps.\nIn addition to the signal excited by the radiation at\noblique incident we also detected a small photocurrent\nat normal incidence. The polarization behavior of this\nsignal is shown in Fig. 4. In this set-up photocurrent\ndependences can be well fitted by Jx = J1 sin 2\u03b1 and\nJy = J1 cos 2\u03b1 (see also Sec. IV.A). Rotating the sam-\nple around z axis we proved that the current direction is\nsolely determined by the orientation of radiation electric\nfield relative to the in-plane crystallographic axes. We\nnote that this contribution is about one order of magni-\ntude smaller than that at oblique incidence even at small\nangles \u03b80 \u2248 15\u25e6.\nBesides investigations of photocurrent in response to\nlinearly polarized radiation we also performed measure-\nments under excitation with elliptically polarized light.\nSuch experiments are of particular interest because such\nradiation, in partially circularly polarized light, has pre-\nviously been used for investigation of the circular pho-\ntogalvanic effect (CPGE)4,7,14 which coexist with the\nLPGE yielding beatings in \u03d5p-dependence. The CPGE\nis characterized by a photocurrent whose direction is\n4FIG. 4: Photocurrent as a function of angle \u03b1 measured at\nnormal incidence (\u03b80 = 0) in a) x and b) y crystallographic\ndirections. Photocurrent is excited by linearly polarized ra-\ndiation with wavelength \u03bb = 148 \u00b5m and power P \u2248 5 kW.\nFull lines are fits to Eqs. (5). To get agreement with exper-\niments we used one fitting parameter J1 \u221d \u03c7\n\u2032. The inset\nshows the experimental geometry. An additional inset in the\nlower panel displays the sample and the radiation electric field\nviewing from the source of radiation side.\nchanged upon reversal of the radiation helicity. It has\nbeen observed in GaN-based structures demonstrating a\nsubstantial structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) in this\nwide band gap material.7,9,10,11 We have shown that SIA\nin GaN-based heterostructures results in a spin splitting\nof subbands in k-space which was later confirmed by\nmagneto-transport measurements.18,19,20,21 The Rashba\nspin-splitting due to SIA, which is not expected in wide\nband semiconductors, in GaN\/AlGaN heterostructures\nis caused by a large piezoelectric effect22 which yields a\nstrong electric field at the GaN\/AlGaN interface and a\nstrong polarization induced doping effect.23\nFigures 5(a) and 5(b) demonstrate the dependences of\nthe photocurrent on the angle \u03d5p for positive angle \u03b80. In\nFig. 5(a) transverse and longitudinal photocurrents are\nmeasured for the experimental set-up with El perpendic-\nular to the incidence plane (s-polarization at \u03d5p = 0). We\nfind that the polarization dependences in this experiment\nare well fitted by Jx = J0(1\u2212 cos 4\u03d5p)\/2+ Joffset and for\ntransverse geometry by Jy = \u2212J0 sin 4\u03d5p \/2 + J2 sin 2\u03d5p,\nsee Sec. IV.B.2 for theoretical justification. We note that\nwe used for fitting the same values of J0 and Joffset as in\nexperiments with linearly polarized radiation.\nAs we discussed above our laser can generate linearly\npolarized radiation either oriented along or perpendic-\nularly to the polarization of the pump radiation. By\nthat we change the position of the electric field of trans-\nformed beam relative to the optical axis of the quarter-\nwave plate, consequently changing the orientation of the\nellipse as well as radiation helicity of the beam at the\nsample. In order to check how this transformation influ-\nence results we provided an additional experiment using\nlaser beam with again \u03bb = 148 \u00b5m and e\u02c6\u2016 \u2016 x but for El\nparallel to the incidence plane (p-polarization at \u03d5p = 0).\nFigures 5(c),(d) show the data obtained in this geome-\ntry. In contrast to the results presented in Figs. 5(a),(b)\nthe photocurrent now shows another type of polarization\ndependences: Jx = J0(3 + cos 4\u03d5p)\/2 + Joffset and for\ntransverse geometry by Jy = J0 sin 4\u03d5p\/2 + J2 sin 2\u03d5p.\nThe fact that contribution given by J2 did not change\nis not surprising because this term is due to radiation\nhelicity which does not change: Pcirc = \u2212 sin 2\u03d5p. The\nchanges in contribution induced by the degree of linear\npolarization are caused by the fact that the orientation\nof corresponding ellipses at the sample at a given \u03d5p is\ndifferent.\nThe photocurrent polarization properties revealed ex-\nperimentally both under normal and oblique incidence\nare explained in the next Section where we propose a\nsimple illustrative model to interpret the nature of the\nphotocurrent under study and derive general phenomeno-\nlogical equations. The measured wavelength and temper-\nature dependences of the LPGE current are described in\nSec. V where a microscopic theory is developed.\nIV. MODELS, PHENOMENOLOGY AND\nPOLARIZATION DEPENDENCES OF THE\nPHOTOCURRENTS\nThe appearance of the LPGE can be visualized by a\nsimple one-dimensional model of randomly distributed\nbut identically oriented wedges acting as asymmetric\nscattering centers.3,4,14 This model showing the gen-\neration of a photogalvanic current is relevant for 2D\nGaN\/AlGaN structures excited by the radiation at nor-\nmal incidence. In Fig. 6 a wedge with a base oriented\nalong x-direction is depicted which obviously does not\npossess a center of inversion. In equilibrium the veloci-\nties of electrons are isotropically distributed. Application\nof an external in-plane alternating field E(t) = E sin\u03c9t\nadds an oscillatory motion along the electric field to the\nrandom thermal motion of the electrons. If the field\npoints along the height of the wedges (E \u2016 y, or \u03b1 = 0),\nthen the scattering results in a carrier flow in the (\u2212y)\ndirection yielding an electric current jy > 0 shown by\nup-arrow in Fig. 6(a). By that electron fluxes along x\ndirection compensate each other and jx is absent. A vari-\nation of the relative direction between the electric field\nand the orientation of the wedges changes the direction\nof the carrier flow resulting in a characteristic polariza-\ntion dependence. It may, e.g., reverse its direction, as it\nis shown in Fig. 6(b) for the field oriented along the base\nof the wedges, or rotate by 90\u25e6 in the case of E directed\nat 45\u25e6 to y axis.\nIn order to describe the observed polarization and an-\n5FIG. 5: Photocurrent as a function of angle \u03d5p measured at oblique incidence (\u03b80 = 15\n\u25e6) in the longitudinal [Jx in a) and c)]\nand transverse [Jy in b) and d)] geometries at wavelength \u03bb = 148 \u00b5m and power P \u2248 5 kW. The ellipticity of the radiation is\nvaried by passing linearly polarized laser radiation (El) through a quarter-wave plate (see insets in the left and right panels).\nLeft panels show transverse and longitudinal photocurrents measured in experimental set-up with El perpendicular to the\nincidence plane (s-polarization at \u03d5p = 0, see inset in the left panel). Photocurrents obtained for El parallel to the incidence\nplane (p-polarization at \u03d5p = 0, see inset in the right panel) are shown in the right panel. Full lines are fits of the photocurrent\nto Eqs. (9) and (10) obtained correspondingly in the experimental set-up sketched in the inset in the left and right panels. The\nfits are obtained using the same values of J0 and Joffset as in the experiments with linearly polarized radiation. The inset in\nthe left panels shows the experimental geometry. On top the polarization ellipses corresponding to various phase angles \u03d5p are\nplotted viewing from the source of radiation.\ngle of incidence dependences, we derive here phenomeno-\nlogical equations for the photocurrents in 2D GaN-based\nstructures and give a model for LPGE. The linear pho-\ntogalvanic current density j is phenomenologically de-\nscribed by the following expression3,4,14\njLPGE\u03bb =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\u03bd\n\u03c7\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd(E\u00b5E\n\u2217\n\u03bd + E\u03bdE\n\u2217\n\u00b5) . (2)\nHere E is the electric field amplitude of the light wave,\nand \u03c7 the third-rank tensor symmetric in the last two\nindices. The index \u03bb enumerates two in-plane coordi-\nnates x and y, while \u00b5 and \u03bd run over all three Cartesian\ncoordinates.\nThe LPGE is allowed only in piezoelectric crystal\nclasses of noncentrosymmetric media where nonzero com-\nponents of the tensor \u03c7 do exist. The point symmetry\nof wurtzite 2D electron systems confined in the [0001]\ndirection is C3v which differs from the C6v symmetry of\nthe bulk GaN due to absence of translation along the\ngrowth axis z, i.e., because of presence of interfaces. The\ncoordinate frame x, y, z chosen in the experimental set-\nup means that the plane (yz) \u2016 (11\u00af00) coincides with the\nmirror reflection planes \u03c3v contained in the C3v point\ngroup. In this point group the tensor \u03c7 has two linearly-\nindependent components for \u03bb 6= z:\n\u03c7 \u2261 \u03c7xxz = \u03c7yyz, \u03c7\u2032 \u2261 \u03c7xxy = \u03c7yxx = \u2212\u03c7yyy . (3)\nThis means that the phenomenological equation (2) re-\nduces to\njLPGEx = \u03c7{ExE\u2217z}+ \u03c7\u2032{ExE\u2217y}, (4)\njLPGEy = \u03c7{EyE\u2217z}+ \u03c7\u2032(|Ex|2 \u2212 |Ey |2) ,\nwhere {E\u00b5E\u2217\u03bd} = E\u00b5E\u2217\u03bd + E\u03bdE\u2217\u00b5.\nA. Normal incidence\nIn our experiments, a linear photogalvanic current is\nobserved at normal incidence, see Fig. 4. It follows from\nEqs. (4) that while at normal incidence the photocur-\nrent proportional to the constant \u03c7 vanishes, because\nEz = 0, the contribution determined by the constant\n6FIG. 6: Model of current generation due to asymmetry of\nspecular elastic scattering by wedges. The field E results in\ndirected motion of carriers shown by dashed arrows. Due to\nasymmetric scattering a directed carrier flow and, therefore,\nelectric current j are generated. a) and b) sketch two relative\norientations of wedges and the electric field E together with\nresulting dc current j.\n\u03c7\u2032 is nonzero. The observation of this photocurrent is an\nimportant result demonstrating substantial difference in\nsymmetry between wurtzite 2D GaN(0001)-based struc-\ntures with C3v symmetry and zinc-blende GaAs- and\nInAs-based heterostructures having C2v or D2d symme-\ntry, where the LPGE is forbidden at normal light inci-\ndence.\nThe polarization dependences for normal incidence fol-\nlow from Eqs. (4) and are given by\njx = \u03c7\n\u2032(t0E0)\n2 sin 2\u03b1 , (5)\njy = \u03c7\n\u2032(t0E0)\n2 cos 2\u03b1 ,\nwhere t0 = 2\/(n\u03c9+1) is the amplitude transmission coef-\nficient for normal incidence, n\u03c9 is the refractive index of\nthe medium (for GaN n\u03c9 = 2.3). Both polarization de-\npendences well describe our experimental data with one\nfitting parameter \u03c7\u2032 (see solid lines in Fig. 4). This agree-\nment clearly demonstrates the generation of LPGE cur-\nrent at normal incidence. We emphasize that the current\ndirection depends on the orientation of the polarization\nplane in respect to the crystallographic axes x and y.\nIn the case that contacts are arbitrary oriented relative\nto the crystallographic directions Eqs. (5) hold but the\nphase shift appears. This is considered in Appendix A.\nB. Oblique incidence\n1. Linear polarization\nLinear photogalvanic effect is also observed at oblique\nincidence. Moreover, comparison of Figs. 1 and 4 shows\nthat even at a small incidence angle \u03b80 the photocurrent\nis substantially (by the order of magnitude) larger than\nthat at normal incidence. While at normal incidence the\nphotogalvanic current is solely described by the constant\n\u03c7\u2032 at oblique incidence another term in Eqs. (4) shows\nup. This term is determined by the second linearly inde-\npendent constant \u03c7. The polarization dependence of this\ncontribution in the geometry relevant to the experiment\ndepicted in Fig. 1, where the incidence plane is chosen to\nbe the plane (xz) and the angle \u03b1 is counted from y, is\ngiven by\njx(\u03b1) = \u03c7E\n2\n0 t\n2\np cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8(1\u2212 cos 2\u03b1) , (6)\njy(\u03b1) = \u2212\u03c7E20tpts sin \u03b8 sin 2\u03b1 .\nHere \u03b8 is the refraction angle related to the incidence an-\ngle \u03b80 by sin \u03b8 = sin \u03b80\/n\u03c9, and ts and tp are the Fresnel\namplitude transmission coefficients from vacuum to the\nstructure for the s- and p-polarized light, respectively.24\nThese functions are shown in Fig. 1 by solid lines. To get\nagreement with experiments we used the above equations\nwith one fitting parameter \u03c7 and introduced an offset for\nthe current Jx detected in the direction of the light prop-\nagation. Registration of these characteristic polarization\ndependences proves observation of LPGE at oblique in-\ncidence.\nComparing the results presented in Figs. 1 and 4 we\ncan estimate of the ratio of different components of the\ntensor \u03c7 for the studied structures. At \u03b8 \u2248 0.1 rad,\nts \u2248 tp \u2248 t0, therefore from the ratio of the amplitudes in\nFigs. 1 and 4 equal to |\u03c7\u2032\/\u03c7 \u03b8| we get |\u03c7\u2032\/\u03c7| \u2248 10\u22122. This\nhierarchy of components of the third rank tensor \u03c7\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd\nin the systems of C3v symmetry is expectable,\n3 however\nwe demonstrate that the \u03c7\u2032-related effect is observable.\nWhile the effect described by the constant \u03c7 also exists in\nthe bulk GaN as well as in the C\u221ev group the photocur-\nrent proportional to \u03c7\u2032 arises only due to the reduced\nsymmetry C3v of the system, i.e. due to size quantiza-\ntion. Therefore the latter contribution should increase at\nnarrowing of 2D layer.\nEquations (6) show that the photogalvanic current\nshould follow the dependence tstp sin \u03b8, in particular, re-\nverse its direction upon inversion the angle of incidence.\nThis behavior is indeed observed. Figure 2 shows LPGE\ncurrent dependence on the incidence angle, \u03b80 obtained\nfor Jy at a fixed linear polarization of radiation (\u03b1 = 45\n\u25e6).\nWe note that the offset photocurrent observed in the lon-\ngitudinal direction only is always directed antiparallel to\ne\u02c6\u2016. We ascribe the offset to the photon drag current\nwhich is linearly coupled to the photon momentum. This\neffect is out of scope of the present paper.\nIn our experiments we also probe LPGE for the light\ndirected along other crystallographic directions. Inves-\ntigating transverse and longitudinal currents being per-\npendicular and parallel to the incidence plane, respec-\ntively, we observed that all polarization dependences are\ndescribed by the same constant \u03c7 independently of the\nin-plane direction of the light propagation. The reason\nof this fact is that the current contribution proportional\nto \u03c7 is due to cone asymmetry being axial isotropic in\nthe plane of our structures. Thus this photocurrent is to-\ntally determined by the light polarization state and prop-\nagation direction, and it is independent of the incidence\n7plane orientation relative to the in-plane crystallographic\naxes. For linearly polarized light the photocurrent can be\npresented in the invariant form as j = 2\u03c7E\u2016Ez where E\u2016\nis the projection of the light polarization vector E onto\nthe structure plane. It is seen that the LPGE current is\nalways directed along E\u2016. By introducing the azimuth\nangle \u03b2 so that \u03b2 = 0 corresponds to the polarization\nperpendicular to the incidence plane (s-polarization) we\nobtain for transverse (j\u22a5) and longitudinal (j\u2016) currents\nj\u22a5 = \u03c7E\n2\n0tpts sin 2\u03b2 (e\u02c6\u2016 \u00d7 z\u02c6) , (7)\nj\u2016 = \u03c7E\n2\n0t\n2\np cos \u03b8 (1\u2212 cos 2\u03b2)e\u02c6\u2016 ,\nwhere z\u02c6 is the unit vector along the normal.\n2. Elliptical polarization\nIllumination of the structure by elliptically polarized\nradiation also results in generation of the LPGE current\nwhich is determined by the linear polarization degree of\nthe light. However, elliptically polarized radiation is also\ncharacterized by the nonzero helicity. This results in the\nadditional effect solely determined by the degree of cir-\ncular polarization, the circular photogalvanic effect.3,4,14\nThis effect is phenomenologically described by\njCPGE\u03bb =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n\u03b3\u03bb\u00b5 i(E \u00d7E\u2217)\u00b5 = E20tptsPcirc(\u03b3e\u02c6)\u03bb , (8)\nwhere e\u02c6 is the light propagation unit vector and \u03b3 the\nsecond-rank pseudotensor. In the systems of C3v symme-\ntry the tensor \u03b3 has one linearly-independent component,\nnamely \u03b3xy = \u2212\u03b3yx \u2261 \u03b3. Thus, the CPGE current flows\nalways perpendicularly to the incidence plane.\nIn our experimental set-up a quarter-wave plate is ro-\ntated by the angle \u03d5p between the laser light polarization\nvector, El, and the principal axis of the polarizer (see in-\nset to Fig. 5). The total photogalvanic current is given by\nboth second and fourth harmonics of this angle. While\nradiation handedness is solely determined by the angle\n\u03d5p and does not depend on the relative orientation be-\ntween El and the plane of incidence the orientation of\nthe ellipse is substantially different. In particular, for\nEl perpendicular to the incidence plane at \u03d5p = 0 (s-\npolarization) and for El parallel to the incidence plane\nat \u03d5p = 0 (p-polarization) the orientation of correspond-\ning ellipses on the sample differs by 90\u25e6. Therefore in\nthe former case light is never p-polarized and in the lat-\nter case s-polarization can not be achieved, which is quite\ndifferent from the geometry of half-wave plate where all\nstates of linear polarization can be obtained. Thus we de-\nrive two sets of equations describing experimental set-up\nof Figs. 5(a),(b) and 5(c),(d).\nIn the first geometry (s-polarization at \u03d5p = 0) from\nEqs. (4) and (8) we get\njx(\u03d5p) =\n\u03c7\n2\nE20t\n2\np cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 (1\u2212 cos 4\u03d5p) , (9)\njy(\u03d5p) = E\n2\n0tpts sin \u03b8\n(\n\u2212\u03c7\n2\nsin 4\u03d5p + \u03b3 sin 2\u03d5p\n)\n,\nand for the latter geometry (p-polarization at \u03d5p = 0)\njx(\u03d5p) =\n\u03c7\n2\nE20t\n2\np cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 (3 + cos 4\u03d5p) , (10)\njy(\u03d5p) = E\n2\n0tpts sin \u03b8\n(\u03c7\n2\nsin 4\u03d5p + \u03b3 sin 2\u03d5p\n)\n.\nHere we again took into account that in our samples\n|\u03c7\u2032| \u226a |\u03c7|. Fits of experiment with the constant \u03c7 in-\ndependently obtained from experiments with half-wave\nplates and \u03b3 as a single adjustable parameter being the\nsame for all curves yields a good agreement with the ex-\nperiment. Here again for the longitudinal photocurrent\nthe offset due to photon drag effect shows up and has\nthe same value as that in the experiments with half-wave\nplates.\nV. MICROSCOPIC THEORY\nIn order to describe the measured dependences of the\nphotocurrent on wavelength and temperature we have\ndeveloped a microscopic theory of LPGE. First we con-\nsider the contribution proportional to the coefficient \u03c7 in\nEqs. (4). This contribution does exist not only in systems\nof the C3v or C6v symmetry but is also allowed by the\nuniaxial point group C\u221ev. Therefore, we can calculate\nthe \u03c7 contribution to jLPGEx,y in the uniaxial approxima-\ntion. Then we turn to calculation of the contribution\nproportional to \u03c7\u2032 in Eqs. (4) and surviving under nor-\nmal incidence due to the reduced C3v symmetry of the\nsystem. We note, that so far the LPGE in 2D systems has\nbeen treated theoretically for direct intersubband transi-\ntions only.25,26 The mechanism of the LPGE under Drude\nabsorption differs strongly because scattering is unavoid-\nably present in the intrasubband absorption process.\nA. Microscopic model for oblique incidence\nMicroscopically the LPGE current consists of the shift\nand ballistic contributions which in general can be com-\nparable in order of magnitude. We start from the analy-\nsis of the shift contribution and then turn to the ballistic\ncontribution.\n1. Shift contribution\nThe shift contribution arises due to coordinate shifts\nof the free-carrier wave-packet center-of-mass by micro-\nscopic lengths in quantum transitions. The correspond-\ning current is a product of the elementary charge e, the\ntransition probability rateWk\u2032k and the shift vectorRk\u2032k\nor, explicitly,\nj\n(shift)\nLPGE = 2e\n\u2211\nk,k\u2032\nWk\u2032k Rk\u2032k , (11)\n8where the factor \u201ctwo\u201d accounts for spin degeneracy. The\nelementary shift is related to the transition matrix ele-\nment Mk\u2032k by\n5\nRk\u2032k = \u2212 Im[M\n\u2217\nk\u2032k\n(\u2207k +\u2207k\u2032)Mk\u2032k]\n|Mk\u2032k|2\n(12)\n= \u2212(\u2207k +\u2207k\u2032)arg(Mk\u2032k) ,\nwhere arg(u) is the phase of the complex number u. The\nabove two equations are general and valid for the shift\nphotocurrent calculation in any frequency range.3,4 Here,\nfor the first time, we apply them to consider the LPGE\nunder the Drude absorption. Note that Eq. (12) was\napplied in the theory of anomalous Hall effect6,27 where\nthe coordinate shift at scattering is called a side-jump.\nThe main contribution to the matrix element for indi-\nrect intrasubband optical transitions,\nM\n\u2016\n1k\u2032,1k = U1k\u2032,1k\n(\nVk\u2032\nEk\u2032 \u2212 Ek \u2212\nVk\nh\u00af\u03c9\n)\n, (13)\ncomes from two-quantum processes a1 and a2 with inter-\nmediate virtual states in the same e1 subband, see Fig. 7.\nHere the 2D electron kinetic energy Ek = h\u00af\n2k2\/2m, m\nFIG. 7: The quantum transitions responsible for the shift\ncontribution to the photocurrent.

(12) is real and hence the elementary shift is\nabsent. The shift contribution becomes nonzero if two\nother indirect processes, b1 and b2 in Fig. 7, are taken\ninto account. The virtual states in these processes lie in\nthe second size-quantized subband e2.

A value of \u03be is nonzero due to an\nasymmetrical shape of the electron envelope functions in\nthe e1 and e2 subbands caused by the build-in electric\nfield. An inhomogeneous asymmetrical distribution of\nscatterers along the z axis can also contribute to \u03be.\n2. Ballistic contribution\nIn order to obtain a nonzero ballistic photocurrent it\nis necessary to go beyond the approximation of single-\nimpurity scattering and take into account simultaneous\nscattering by two impurities in one process. Such optical-\nabsorption processes are schematically shown in Fig. 8.\nLet us introduce the antisymmetrical part, W a\nk\u2032k\n, of the\nk \u2192 k\u2032 transition rate Wk\u2032k which changes sign under\nsimultaneous inversion of the wave vectors k and k\u2032. It\ncan be expressed in terms of Fermi\u2019s golden rule\nW a\nk\u2032k\n=\n2pi\nh\u00af\n|Mk\u2032k|2a [f(Ek)\u2212 f(Ek\u2032)] \u03b4(Ek\u2032 \u2212 Ek \u2212 h\u00af\u03c9) ,\n(19)\nwhere |Mk\u2032k|2a is the antisymmetric part of the squared\nmodulus of the optical two-impurity-mediated matrix ele-\nmentMk\u2032k. Then the ballistic contribution to the LPGE\ncurrent is given by\nj\n(ball)\nLPGE = 2e\n\u2211\nk,k\u2032\nW ak\u2032k \u03c4p (vk\u2032 \u2212 vk) , (20)\nwhere vk = h\u00afk\/m is the electron velocity.\nHere it is worth to discuss the dependence of the ballis-\ntic and shift contributions on the concentration of elastic\nscatterers Nd. For two-impurity scattering the proba-\nbility rate W a\nk\u2032k\n\u221d N2d . In contrast, the single-impurity\nscattering rate Wk\u2032k in Eq. (11) linearly depends on Nd.\nHowever, the ballistic current is controlled by the mo-\nmentum relaxation time, see the factor \u03c4p in the right-\nhand side of Eq. (20). Since \u03c4p \u221d N\u22121d , the ballistic and\nshift currents are both proportional to Nd. In this sense,\nthere is an analogy between a pair of the two contribu-\ntions to the photocurrent and a pair of the side-jump and\nskew-scattering currents in the anomalous Hall effect.6\nIn order to get the photocurrent proportional to both\ne\u2016 and ez, we extract from |Mk\u2032k|2 the interference term\nproportional to Re\n{\nM\u2016M\u22a5\u2217\n}\n, where M\u2016 and M\u22a5 are\nthe contributions to the matrix element of the indirect\noptical transition proportional to ex,y and ez, respec-\ntively. To the lowest order in h\u00af\u03c9\/\u220621 \u226a 1, one should in-\nclude into consideration six two-impurity scattering pro-\ncesses a3 . . .a8 contributing to M\n\u2016 and two processes b3,\nb4 for M\n\u22a5 depicted in Fig. 8.\nFor example, below we present the contributions toM\u2016\nfrom the processes a5 and a6,\nM\u2016a5 = Nd \u00d7\n(21)\u2211\nk1k2\nU \u203211 Vk2 U11 U\n\u2032\n11 \u03b4k+k2,k\u2032+k1\n(Ek2 \u2212 Ek \u2212 h\u00af\u03c9 \u2212 i0)(Ek2 \u2212 Ek \u2212 i0)(Ek1 \u2212 Ek \u2212 i0)\n,\nM\u2016a6 = Nd \u00d7\u2211\nk1k2\nVk\u2032 U\n\u2032\n11U11 U\n\u2032\n11 \u03b4k+k2,k\u2032+k1\n(Ek\u2032 \u2212 Ek \u2212 i0)(Ek2 \u2212 Ek \u2212 i0)(Ek1 \u2212 Ek \u2212 i0)\n,\nwhere the prime means the scattering (shown by dotted\nlines in Fig. 8) by a defect different from that which is\nrelated to the matrix element U11 in these equations and\nto U21 in Eq. (15) (shown by dashed lines). The Kro-\nnecker symbols are obtained after averaging the matrix\nelement over the in-plane distribution of the second scat-\nterer. Note that averaging over its distribution in the z\ndirection results in replacement of the square (U \u203211)\n2 by\n\u3008U211\u3009. The energy denominators are rewritten by using\nthe identity\n1\nx\u2212 i0 = PV\n1\nx\n+ ipi\u03b4(x) ,\nand, among three such terms in each contribution M\n\u2016\naj\n(j = 3...8), we retain the \u03b4-function in one of them and\ntake the Cauchy principal values for two others. This\nadditional \u03b4-function, together with the energy conser-\nvation law (14) and the relation k + k2 = k\n\u2032 + k1, fixes\nabsolute values of the wave vectors k,k\u2032,k1 and k2.

Microscopic model for normal incidence\nAn ideal GaN\/AlN interface has the point-group sym-\nmetry C3v which is a subgroup of the C\n4\n6v space group\nof a bulk wurtzite crystal. The group C46v is nonsym-\nmorphic and contains, in addition to C3 and \u03c3v, the el-\nements {C6|\u03c4}, {\u03c3d|\u03c4}, where \u03c4 is the fractional lattice\ntranslation (0,0,c\/2) and c is the lattice constant along\nthe principal axis z. In the 2D structures, the screw-axis\nand glide-plane operations shift the interfaces along z not\nbringing the system into coincidence with itself and, as a\nresult, the point-group symmetry reduces to C3v.\nFor the C6v symmetry of bulk wurtzite structure, char-\nacteristic of III-nitrides, the nonvanishing third order\ntensor components \u03c7\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd symmetrical in \u00b5 and \u03bd are\n\u03c7zzz, \u03c7zxx = \u03c7zyy, \u03c7xxz = \u03c7xzx = \u03c7yyz = \u03c7yzy \u2261 \u03c7.\nTherefore, forbidden are such bulk effects as the second-\nharmonic generation for excitation along z, a piezoelec-\ntric field induced in the (x, y) plane under the deforma-\ntion in this plane and the photocurrent in the (x, y) plane\nfor the light propagating along z. The reduction from C6v\nto C3v removes these restrictions and four new nonzero\ncomponents appear, \u03c7xxy = \u03c7xyx = \u03c7yxx = \u2212\u03c7yyy \u2261 \u03c7\u2032,\nsee Eqs. (4). Note that it is the interface that is exclu-\nsively responsible for the appearance of new components.\nHere we propose a microscopic model of the LPGE\nunder normal incidence. In this geometry virtual tran-\nsitions via other size-quantized electronic subbands are\nforbidden, therefore we should consider the light absorp-\ntion with intermediate states either in the same e1 elec-\ntronic subband or in the valence band. In the first case,\nsee Fig. 7, the reduced C3v symmetry manifests itself\nin the scattering matrix element U1k\u2032,1k, and, instead of\nEq. (16), one should replace the elementary shift in the\nproduct |Mk\u2032k|2Rk\u2032k by the scattering induced shift\nR\n(U)\nk\u2032k\n= \u2212 Im[U\n\u2217\n1k\u2032,1k(\u2207k +\u2207k\u2032)U1k\u2032,1k]\n|U1k\u2032,1k|2\n.\nNote that the main contribution to U1k\u2032,1k dependent\nonly on the difference (k\u2032\u2212k) does not result in the shift\nbecause the operator (\u2207k + \u2207k\u2032) nullifies such a term.\nSimilar contribution to the LPGE current has been cal-\nculated for Drude absorption in the heavy-hole subband\nof a bulk p-GaAs,30 where the shift appeared due to inter-\nference of polar and deformation scattering mechanisms\non optical phonons.\nFor optical transitions going via \u03936 valence-band\nstates, the elementary shift can be related to asymmetry\nof the interband optical matrix elements in which case\nthe asymmetry of the interband scattering matrix ele-\nment is neglected. We consider this mechanism in more\ndetail. Taking into account the symmetry considerations\nwe can present the interband matrix elements of the op-\nerator e\u2016 \u00b7 p (p is the momentum operator) between the\nconduction-band state \u03931 and the valence-band states \u03936\nas\ne\u2016 \u00b7 pc\u03931;v,\u03936x(k) = iPex +Q(exky + eykx) , (23)\ne\u2016 \u00b7 pc\u03931;v,\u03936y(k) = iPey +Q(exkx \u2212 eyky) ,\nwhere P and Q are real constants. Multi-band deriva-\ntion of these contributions for GaN-based 2D struc-\ntures is given in Appendix B. The matrix element Q\nis nonzero due to the presence of the interface in the\nheterostructure. This approach is similar to descrip-\ntion of interface inversion asymmetry induced spin split-\nting in the envelope-function method where \u03b4-functional\nterms are introduced into the interband Hamiltonian, see\nRefs. 31,32. As a result, we expect a strong dependence\nof Q on the confinement size because Q is proportional to\na product of the electron and hole envelope functions at\nthe interface, see Eq. (B3). We expand Mk\u2032k and Rk\u2032k\nin powers of small parameters h\u00af\u03c9\/Eg, E\u00af\/Eg \u226a 1. In the\nsame nonvanishing order we should take into account k-\ndependence of the matrix element P . This could be done\n11\nby replacing in Eq. (23) the constant P by the function\nP(k) = P0\n(\n1\u2212 Ek\n2Eg\n)\n.\nThe interband scattering c\u03931k \u2194 v\u03936xk\u2032 and c\u03931k \u2194\nv\u03936yk\n\u2032 is described by the constant matrix elements Ucvx\nand Ucvy assumed to be independent of k and k\n\u2032, with\n\u3008U2cvx\u3009 = \u3008U2cvy\u3009.\nIn order to carry out a reasonable estimation of the\ncoefficient \u03c7\u2032 in Eqs. (4) we have used a simple nonrela-\ntivistic k \u00b7p model coupling the c\u03931 and v\u03936 band states.\nIn this model the valence band consists of two subbands,\none with an infinite in-plane effective mass and the other\nwith the hole in-plane effective mass coinciding with that\nfor a conduction-band electron. Omitting the details of\nderivation we present the final result\n\u03c7\u2032 =\n2pie3\nm20\u03c9\n\u3008U2cvx\u3009P0Q\nE3g\nNsF1 , (24)\nwhere F1 \u2261 F [1] =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\n[f(E)\u2212f(E+ h\u00af\u03c9)]dE\n\/\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nf(E)dE .\nExperiment shows a noticeable magnitude of the LPGE\ncurrent under normal incidence, see Fig. 4.\nVI. DISCUSSION\nIn this Section we discuss the role of the contributions\nto the total current and analyze the frequency and tem-\nperature dependences of LPGE. An analytical estimation\nfor the shift and ballistic photocurrents at Drude absorp-\ntion is readily available for the photon energies h\u00af\u03c9 small\nas compared to the electron typical energy E\u00af which is\nrelevant to our experiments performed at room temper-\nature and applying THz radiation. In this case Eqs. (17)\nand (22) reduce to\nj\n(shift)\nLPGE \u223c 2\u03beez21\n\u03b7\u2016I\n\u220621\n,\nj\n(ball)\nLPGE \u223c \u03beez21\n\u03b7\u2016I\n\u220621\n(\nh\u00af\u03c9\n2E\u00af\n)2\n.\nSince h\u00af\u03c9\/E\u00af \u226a 1 the shift contribution dominates the\nLPGE. This estimation is confirmed by the study of the\nfrequency dependence of LPGE. Indeed, while the shift\nphotocurrent follows the frequency dependence of the ab-\nsorbance which, for Drude processes, is given by Eq. (1),\nthe ballistic contribution has another frequency depen-\ndence because in this case j\n(ball)\nLPGE \u221d \u03b7\u2016\u03c92. The observed\ngood agreement of the current and absorption frequency\nbehavior (see Fig. 3) unambiguously proves the dominat-\ning role of the shift contribution to the LPGE. We note,\nthat such a spectral behavior of the LPGE has been pre-\nviously observed in bulk III-V semiconductors.33\nWe note that even for the opposite limit of h\u00af\u03c9\/E\u00af \u226b 1\nthe LPGE due to Drude absorption is still dominated\nby the shift contribution. In this case estimations yield\nj\n(shift)\nLPGE = \u2212(3\/2)j(ball)LPGE.\nNow we analyze the temperature dependence. As fol-\nlows from Eq. (17), the temperature dependence of the\nLPGE current is given by j\n(shift)\nLPGE \u221d \u03be \u03b7\u2016(T ). Taking into\naccount temperature behavior of the Drude absorption\n[see Eq. (18)] we get j\n(shift)\nLPGE \u221d \u03be\/\u03c4p(T ). Here we again\nuse the relation h\u00af\u03c9 \u226a E\u00af \u223c kBT . Variation of the tem-\nperature results in the change of the dominant scatter-\ning mechanisms. Typically in the low-dimensional struc-\ntures by raising temperature we get a transition from\nthe temperature-independent scattering rate by impuri-\nties 1\/\u03c4 impp to the fast-increasing rate due to scattering\nby phonons 1\/\u03c4php (T ). As a result we have for the LPGE\ncurrent\nj\n(shift)\nLPGE \u221d\n\u03beimp\n\u03c4 impp\n+\n\u03beph\n\u03c4php (T )\n.\nThis expression demonstrates that despite the inverse\nmobility 1\/\u00b5(T ) \u221d 1\/\u03c4 impp + 1\/\u03c4php (T ) is a monotonous\nfunction of temperature (see inset in Fig. 3) and the\nasymmetry factors \u03be are temperature-independent, the\nLPGE current can have a minimum or even change the\nsign at temperature increase. This is due to the interplay\nbetween two contributions to the LPGE caused by dif-\nferent scattering mechanisms characterized by substan-\ntially different values of \u03beimp and \u03beph possibly being even\nopposite in signs. Due to the fact that only one time\nis temperature dependent [\u03c4php (T )] variation of temper-\nature may result in the dominance of one or the other\ncontribution to the LPGE current.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we have studied the linear photogalvanic\neffect in wurtzite GaN(0001)-based heterojunctions un-\nder excitation by linearly and elliptically polarized light\nin the terahertz frequency range. Experimentally, the\nproperties of LPGE have been revealed as a function\nof the incidence angle and the polarization state of ra-\ndiation. A detailed point-group symmetry analysis of\nthe polarization properties shows an agreement between\nthe experiment data and the phenomenological theory\nof LPGE. Phenomenologically, the effect is described by\ntwo linearly independent coefficients \u03c7 and \u03c7\u2032, the former\nbeing allowed by the C3v, C6v and even C\u221ev symmetries\nand the latter being nonzero only for the C3v symmetry.\nAn observation of the photocurrent under normal inci-\ndence determined by \u03c7\u2032 unambiguously demonstrates a\nreduction of the heterojunction symmetry from hexago-\nnal C6v to trigonal C3v. However, beginning from very\nsmall oblique angles first contribution to the photocur-\nrent prevails over the second one. The frequency de-\npendence of the measured LPGE photocurrent exhibits\na Drude-like behavior. A microscopic theory of LPGE\nunder the intrasubband (Drude) absorption in the lowest\n12\ne1 electron subband has been developed. While calcu-\nlating the \u03c7-related photocurrent we have included vir-\ntual indirect optical transitions via the higher subband\ne2, estimated both the shift and ballistic contributions\nand showed that the first one exceeds the other by a\nlarge factor \u221d (E\u00af\/h\u00af\u03c9)2. The dominating shift photocur-\nrent repeats a Lorentzian frequency dependence of the\nDrude-absorption coefficient, in agreement with the ex-\nperiment. The temperature dependence of the photocur-\nrent is governed by a product of the absorption coefficient\nand the dimensionless parameter of asymmetry. Micro-\nscopically, the contribution nonvanishing under normal\nincidence arises taking into account indirect optical tran-\nsitions via virtual electronic states in the valence band.\nAcknowledgments\nThe financial support from the DFG and RFBR is\ngratefully acknowledged.

We obtained that the\nphotocurrent direction is determined by the orientation\nof the electric vector with respect to the crystallographic\naxes x and y. Most convenient for this effect is to in-\nvestigate the current in the directions along and perpen-\ndicular to one of the mirror reflection planes of the C3v\npoint group. However, in contrast to III-V semiconductor\nheterostructures where well determined in-plane crystal-\nlographic orientation is naturally obtained by cleaving,\nin GaN\/AlGaN heterojunctions grown on the sapphire\nsubstrate this may be not the case. Therefore we obtain\nhere the LPGE for the arbitrary orientation of contacts\nin respect to the crystallographic directions. To describe\nthis situation we introduce the angle \u03a6 between the in-\nplane directions x\u2032 and y\u2032 along which the contacts are\nmade and the crystallographic axes x and y, see Fig. 9.\nThe symmetry considerations yield the expression for the\ncombination of x\u2032 and y\u2032 components of the photocurrent\nwhich follows from Eqs. (4) for Ez = 0\njx\u2032 + ijy\u2032 = i\u03c7\n\u2032(Ex\u2032 \u2212 iEy\u2032)(E\u2217x\u2032 \u2212 iE\u2217y\u2032) exp(3i\u03a6)\nFIG. 9: Schematic representation of the orientation of the\ncrystallographic axes x, y relative to the directions x\u2032, y\u2032 along\nwhich the current is measured.\nor, equivalently,\njx\u2032 = \u03c7\n\u2032(t0E0)\n2 sin (2\u03b1\u2212 3\u03a6) , (A1)\njy\u2032 = \u03c7\n\u2032(t0E0)\n2 cos (2\u03b1\u2212 3\u03a6) ,\nwhere \u03b1 is counted from y\u2032: E(\u03b1 = 0) \u2016 y\u2032.\nEquations (A1) demonstrate that the azimuth angular\ndependence for arbitrary orientation of contacts in re-\nspect to the crystallographic directions remains the same\nbut differs by the phase shift 3\u03a6.\nFinally we note that the photocurrent determined by\nthe constant \u03c7 in Eqs. (4) is independent of the angle \u03a6\nbecause it is totally defined by position of the incidence\nplane and polarization of light. Therefore Eqs. (7) holds\nfor any angle \u03a6.\nAPPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF INTERBAND\nMATRIX ELEMENTS\nEquation (23) can be obtained from the two-band elec-\ntron effective Hamiltonian\nHc\u03931;v,\u03936x(k) =\nh\u00af\nm0\n(iPkx +Qkxky) , (B1)\nHc\u03931;v,\u03936y(k) =\nh\u00af\nm0\n[\niPky +Q1\n2\n(k2x \u2212 k2y)\n]\n,\nby using the relation\ne \u00b7 pc\u03931;v,\u03936(k) =\nm0\nh\u00af\n(e \u00b7 \u2207k)Hc\u03931;v,\u03936(k) .\nWe describe the symmetry reduction from C6v to C3v\nby introducing a \u03b4-functional perturbation V\u02c6 \u2032\u03b4(z \u2212 zif),\nwhere zif is the interface coordinate in the z axis and the\noperator V\u02c6 \u2032 transforms according to the representation\nB1 of the group C6v with the basic function y\n3 \u2212 3x2y\n(here as before we assume that one of the three mirror-\nreflection planes in the C3v group contains the axes y, z\nand is perpendicular to x). The perturbation V\u02c6 \u2032 mixes\nthe Bloch state \u03936 with \u03935 and the Bloch state \u03933 with\n\u03931.\n13\nIn order to find the quadratic-in-k correction in\nEq.

H\u02c6n,n\u2032 is the matrix of the first-order matrix\nelements of the k \u00b7p coupling or the interface mixing be-\ntween the states in the bands n and n\u2032; E0n is the electron\nenergy in the band n at the \u0393 point. The dimension of\nthe matrix H\u02c6n,n\u2032 is N \u00d7N \u2032 where N,N \u2032 are degeneracies\nof the bands n and n\u2032, respectively. Taking into account\nthe bands s\u03936 (s 6= v), s\u2032\u03935 and s\u2032\u2032\u03933 we can present\nthe coefficient Q in Eq.
