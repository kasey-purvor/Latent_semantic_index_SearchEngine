However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are \nstill poorly understood. 1180 sequences (Expressed Sequence Tags or ESTs) were \ngenerated and analyzed, from populations of C. antarcticus. This represents the first \npublicly available sequence data for this species. A sub-set (672 clones) were used to \ngenerate a small microarray to examine the differences in gene expression between \nsummer acclimated cold tolerant and non-cold tolerant springtails. Although 60% of \nthe clones showed no sequence similarity to annotated genes in the datasets, of those \nwhere putative function could be inferred via database homology, there was a clear \npattern of up-regulation of structural proteins being associated with the cold tolerant \ngroup. These structural proteins mainly comprised cuticle proteins and provide \nsupport for the recent theory that summer SCP variation within Collembola species \ncould be a consequence of moulting, with moulting populations having lowered SCPs.  \n \n \nKeywords \n \nCold tolerance, Collembolan, freeze avoidance, SCP, moulting\n 2\nSpringtail array \nIntroduction  \n \nLow temperature biology, in particular the mechanisms by which organisms survive \nextreme low temperatures, is of intense interest not only to ecologists, but also in a \nnumber of applied medical fields (Fuller, 1999). One of the most amenable and \nstudied group of organisms is the arthropoda where such physiological processes are \nwell documented (Salt, 1961; Lee and Denlinger, 1991; S\u00f8mme, 1995; Sinclair et al, \n2003a). These organisms have evolved two distinct strategies to survive sub-zero \ntemperatures termed freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance (Cannon and Block, 1988; \nBlock, 1990 see also Bale, 1993 for more ecologically-refined schemes of \nclassificiation). A third mechanism,  protective dehydration, has more recently been \ndescribed but is perhaps less common. (Worland, 1996; Holmstrup et al. 2002).  \nDelineation into these groups is often performed using the measurement of the \ntemperature at which the insect's body fluids freeze, normally termed the supercooling \npoint  (SCP).  \n \nFreeze avoidance is the main strategy used by Antarctic terrestrial microarthropods \n(Block 1990, 1991; Cannon and Block, 1988; Convey, 1996), which routinely have to \nsurvive over wintering temperatures below -20\u00b0C. For these organisms the SCP is \nequal to their lower lethal temperature. This is not the case for all arthropods as some \nhave been shown to die before they freeze (chill susceptible) (Bale, 2002). Other \nfactors such as the cooling rate can affect the measured SCP and the lower lethal \ntemperature (Worland, 2005). Cold tolerance also varies seasonally, with higher mean \nvalues in the summer for active feeding animals than for  winter acclimated,  cold \nhardened individuals (Cannon and Block, 1988). Seasonal cold-hardening involves a \n 3\nSpringtail array \nnumber of physiological and biochemical processes that slowly increase supercooling \nability and enhance survival at low temperatures. Such mechanisms include the \nremoval or deactivation of ice nucleating agents, accumulation of cryoprotectants and \nthermal hysteresis proteins (Knight & Duman, 1986; S\u00f8mme L, 1982; 1995; \nZachariassen, 1992). This gives rise to a bimodal distribution of SCPs with a  high \ngroup (less cold tolerant) and a low group (more cold tolerant) (Cannon, 1983; \nSchenker, 1984; Rothery and Block, 1992; Worland & Convey, 2001, Block, 1982, \n1984; van der Woude 1987, Sinclair et al 2003b).  \n \nThis is particularly evident during the growing season in the summer when, perhaps \nsurprisingly, a proportion of the population still exhibit low SCPs. This phenomenon \nhas been extensively studied, but its exact nature remains unclear, i.e. whether it is an \nadaptation to environmental conditions or part of the animals natural lifecycle. It has \nbeen correlated in some studies with the presence or absence of gut contents (S\u00f8mme \n& Conradi-Larsen, 1977; Young & Block, 1980; S\u00f8mme, 1981; Block, 1982; \nCannon, 1983; Cannon & Block, 1988; Rothery & Block, 1992). It has also been \nsuggested that some insects retain a low SCP during the summer, providing insurance \nagainst unexpected freezing temperatures (Chown and Klok, 1998).  In inland \ncontinental areas where there is a year-round risk of sub-zero temperatures, springtails \nshow permanent cold tolerance even at the \"height\" of summer (S\u00f8mme, 1985). \nRecently, the effect of moulting on SCP has been observed in Collembola (Worland, \n2005; Worland et al, 2006, Worland and Convey, 2008). Moulting might be expected \nto depress the SCP, because in Collembola the mid-gut and its entire contents are shed \nduring moulting (Thibaud, 1968) resulting in the expulsion of potential ice nucleators \n 4\nSpringtail array \npresent in the animals gut. In this case cold tolerance can be viewed as a natural part \nof the animals life cycle rather than an adaptation per se.  \n \nIn general, species typified by a bimodal SCP distribution show a population shift \nfrom high to low SCPs as winter approaches (Cannon and Block, 1988), but SCPs in \nsome Antarctic species can vary or be altered diurnally (Sinclair, 2003b)  or even \nwithin hours (Worland and Convey, 2001) in response to changing environmental \nconditions. This \"rapid cold hardening\" is almost certainly a critical factor in the \nability of Antarctic terrestrial arthropods to survive variable and unpredictable \nsummer temperatures (Convey, 1997).  Although the molecular processes involved in \nrapid cold hardening and the relationship between seasonal and rapid cold hardening \nhave yet to be characterised, they are thought to be distinct mechanisms (Worland and \nConvey, 2001). \n \nThis study focusses on the overwinter survival strategy of the  freeze-avoiding \nspringtail Cryptopygus antarcticus Willem (Collembola, Isotomidae). This is one of \nthe most abundant and widespread terrestrial arthropod in the Maritime Antarctic and \nSub-Antarctic regions (Block, 1982; Usher and Booth, 1986; Convey and Smith, \n1997) and has been one of most studied Antarctic microarthropods over the last thirty \nyears (e.g. Ewing, 1922; Gressitt, 1967; Janetschek, 1967; Tilbrook, 1970, 1977; \nCannon and Block, 1988; Worland and Convey, 2001). It shows a bimodal SCP \ndistribution with distinct High (-8\u00baC to \u201310\u00baC) and Low (\u201318\u00baC to \u201330\u00baC) groups \n(S\u00f8mme and Block, 1982, Rothery and Block, 1992; Worland and Convey, 2001). \nStudies on C. antarcticus have contributed greatly towards our understanding of cold \ntolerance, but to date neither this species, nor any other polar arthropod, has been the \n 5\nSpringtail array \nsubject of sequence-based analyses. In order to redress this deficit and gain an insight \ninto the genome of C. Antarcticus, 1180 ESTs were generated and a sub-set of clones \nused to produce a small microarray. The aim was to use novel tools provided by \nmicroarray expression analysis to provide an insight into the underlying biochemical \nmechanisms behind the summer bimodal SCP populations and increase our \nunderstanding of the nature of environmental adaptation in these arthropods in one of \nthe world\u2019s most challenging environments. \n \n \nMaterials and methods \nSample collection and preparation:  \nAntarctic springtails (Cryptopygus antarcticus) were collected from wet moss \n(Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) during the austral summer of 2005 at the British \nAntarctic Survey's research station at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island (67'34'\uf020S, \n\uf02066'8'W). The SCPs of the animals were measured using a differential scanning \ncalorimeter (DSC) (Mettler Toledo DSC 820). The boundary temperature dividing \nhigh and low group SCPs was defined as -15\u00baC (Worland and Convey, 2001). \nAnimals which survived cooling to -15\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C\/minute  were designated as Low \nGroup (LG) animals (SCP below -15\u00b0C), and those which died were designated as the \nHigh Group (HG, SCP above -15\u00b0C). All groups of animals were rapidly frozen in \nliquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until required. Live animals maintained with food \nin a +2\u00b0C growth cabinet were used as controls. \n \ncDNA libraries and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing:  \n 6\nSpringtail array \nESTs were generated from a mixed population of animals. Total RNA was extracted \nby homogenizing samples in Tri Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturers \ninstructions. 5\u00b5g Poly A+ mRNA was prepared from total RNA using the Oligotex \nmRNA Kit-Midi kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers instructions.  Directional \nplasmid cDNA libraries were  produced using the pBluescript\u00aeII XR cDNA Library \nConstruction Kit (Stratagene). The inserts from each isolated clone in the cDNA \nlibrary were amplified via PCR, performed in a reaction mixture of 20 \u03bcl containing: \n1X NH4 reaction buffer (Bioline), 0.125 \u00b5M of each M13 primer (M13 reverse: 5\u2019-\nAACAGCTATGACCATGAT-3\u2019, M13 forward: 5\u2019-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3\u2019), \n0.084 mM of dNTPs (Bioline), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U of Taq Polymerase \n(Bioline). After an initial denaturation of 2 min. at 96\u00b0C, the thermal cycling \nconsisted of 30 cycles of denaturation at 96\u00b0C for 20s, primer annealing at 49\u00b0C for \n20s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 3 min. In the final cycle, the extension was prolonged \nfor 5 min. This reaction was also repeated using amine terminated M13 primers to \nproduce cDNA products to be printed on the microarray. After PCR, all products were \ndiluted with 30\u00b5l of sterile distilled water. Enzymatic cleanup of the amplified cDNA \nwas performed using 5\u00b5l of non-amine terminated PCR product, 0.4U Shrimp \nAlkaline Phosphatase (GE Healthcare), 0.6U Exonuclease I (GE Healthcare) in a total \nvolume of 6\u00b5l containing Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase dilution buffer. The reactions \nwere incubated at 37\u00baC for 30 min and then at 80\u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate the \nenzymes. This 6\u00b5l reaction was then used as a template in a sequencing reaction by \nadding 4 \u00b5l of ET-terminator pre-mix (GE Healthcare) and 0.5 \u00b5M M13long reverse \nsequencing primer (5\u2019-AACAGCTATGACCATGATTACG-3\u2019). Thermal cycling \nconditions were 26 cycles at 20s at 95\u00b0C and 2 min and 20 s at 60\u00b0C. Sequence \n 7\nSpringtail array \nreactions were ethanol precipitated and run on a MegaBACE 1000 capillary \nsequencer (GE Healthcare) using standard sequence filters and a 100 min run time.  \n \nSequence data analysis:  \nSequence fasta files were processed using the script Trace2dbest (Parkinson et al, \n2004), which incorporated the phred (Ewing and Green, 1998a; 1998b) and \ncrossmatch (P. Green, unpublished) programmes. A minimum cut-off value of 100bp \nwas applied after quality control processing for sequence database searching and for \ngenerating the submission file for dbEST (Boguski et al, 1993) (Accession numbers, \ndbEST: 55137170-55138349, Genbank: FF278135-FF279314). Tgicl (Pertea et al, \n2003) was used for clustering the fasta files, incorporating quality scores. The clusters \nwere database searched using Blastx (Altschul et al, 1997) against the \nUniprot\/Swissprot and Uniprot\/Trembl databases (The Uniprot Consortium, 2007), \nwith matches annotated for all scores with an expect score less than 1e-10. Sequences \nwith a database match were then further annotated using GO and GOSLIM (The Gene \nOntology Consortium, 2000) to the full depth of their significant Blast matches.  \n \nMicroarray construction and hybridization:  \nA microarray was produced from seven 96 well clone plates with the highest insert \nratios from the 1124 EST bacterial clones to give a total of 672 clones printed in \nduplicate. The Stratagene SpotReport Alien cDNA Array Validation System was \nincluded on the microarray. The microarray was probed with three populations of \nCryptopygus: control animals (mixed population), high group animals and low group \nanimals. Prior to microarray printing, the probes were prepared as described in Lyne \net al, 2003 and printed using a Genetix Q-array robot. Microarrays were incubated  in \n 8\nSpringtail array \na saturated sodium chloride humid chamber at room temperature overnight and post-\nprocessed according to the manufacturers instructions. PCR amplified ds cDNA \nprobes for all groups were prepared using the protocol described in Petalidis et al \n(2003) with the addition of 1\u00b5l Stratagene Alien mRNA spikes 1-6 into the initial \ntotal RNA. The Cy5 and Cy3 samples were pooled together and 6\u03bcg poly dA and  6\u03bcg \nyeast tRNA (Sigma) were added as blocking agents. The samples were ethanol \nprecipitated. Labelled targets were resuspended in 20\u00b5l of hybridisation buffer (40% \nformamide, 5x SSC, 5x Denhardt\u2019s solution, 1mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50mM \nTris pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS), denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 mins and allowed to cool at room \ntemperature for 5 mins prior to hybridization. The labelled targets for each of the two \nexperimental animal groups were hybridized to the microarray with labelled control \ngroup target as a reference. Hybridizations were performed in a humidified incubator \nat 49\u00baC overnight. The microarrays were then washed in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 \nmin, followed by 2x SSC for 5 min. and finally in 0.1x SSC for 5 min, all at RT. After \nwashing, slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned on a Molecular Devices \nGenePix 4100 microarray scanner. The design entailed five biological replicates and \nthree technical replicates, one of which was a dye swop, per treatment. \n \nMicroarray data analysis:  \nThe images were analysed using the GenePix  6.0 software (Molecular Devices). \nAfter gridding and segmentation, visual inspection was used to flag and exclude \nanomalous spots. The R (R Development Core Team, 2005) Limma package (Smyth, \n2004, 2005; Richie et al, 2007; Smyth and Speed, 2003; Smyth et al, 2003) was used \nfor background subtraction, normalisation and to determine the differentially \nexpressed clones at an FDR adjusted p-value of 0.01. GO enrichment was determined \n 9\nSpringtail array \nby a proprtion test, at a p-value of 0.01, between the number of clones representing a \nGO term on the chip compared to the number of differentially expressed clones \nrepresenting the same GO term in a given list. The array design is housed at \nArrayExpress, accession number: A-MEXP-1128, and the experiments: E-MEXP-\n1569. \n \nQ PCR:  \nTo validate the microarray results, 3 clones were chosen for Q-PCR analysis: \nCR_C02P0_01G10: Control: CF: CGCTCTTCATTTAATGGGGTT, CRev:  \nAAACGACATTCGAGTACTTCAT; CHK1: CHKF: \nAGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGGCT CHKRev: CTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCT; \nCuticle7F: CAAGATGAACTTGGTCAAGCAT, cuticle7Rev: \nCTGATAAGAGCATCAGCATGA. The RSq and efficiency values for each of these \nprimer sets was: 0.970\/115.5%; 0.991\/150.8% and 0.990\/102.2% respectively. All \ngenes were amplified using specific primers, Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR Master \nMix (Stratagene) and an MX3000P Q-PCR machine (Stratagene). PCR conditions \nwere as follows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 minute and \n72\u00b0C for 45 seconds with a final dissociation curve step as per manufacturers \nrecommendations. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR experiment consisted of the 3 \nanimal treatments (control, High and Low Groups) amplified for all 3 primer pairs in \ntriplicate. The whole  experiment was repeated in duplicate. Primers were validated \nand the results analysed as described in Clark et al (2008) using the method of Pfaffl \n(2001) which incorporates the efficiency of the primers as a factor in the equation.  \n \nResults \n 10\nSpringtail array \n \nEST analysis \nSequence data was generated for 1180 ESTs. Clustering produced 777 putative \ntranscripts, of which almost 60% had no annotation when searched against the \nTrEMBL and SwissProt databases (Table 1). The two largest clusters produced \nmatches against insect mitochondrial genomes (Table 2), with the smaller clusters \nproducing matches against genes involved in energy production (ATP synthase, \nADP\/ATP translocase, Cytochrome C oxidase) and skeletal functioning (Troponin). \nGOSLIM analysis of the EST clones indicates that the RNA was populated by \nmetabolically active genes, with the IDs for cellular process, transport, response to \nstimulus, regulation of biological process and metabolic process predominating the \nlistings (Table 3). \n \nMicroarray analysis \n672 clones were chosen for the array, of which 214 clones (40%) had BLAST \nmatches against the Swiss-Prot\/TrEMBL databases (Table 1). The results of the \nclustering mirrored those for the ESTs with the largest cluster (of  71 clones) \nproducing matches against the giant springtail mitochondrial sequence and the second \nlargest cluster (7 clones) matching an ADP\/ATP translocase. \n \nClones within 29 clusters were significantly upregulated (Table 4) in the Low Group \nwhen compared to the control sample. Of these, 18 clusters showed no significant \nsequence similarity against the databases. It was possible to assign at least some \nfunctionality to 11 of the clusters, with cuticle and exoskeleton-related proteins \npredominating  (3 out of 11 clusters) and indeed this was the only overarching \n 11\nSpringtail array \ndescription to be duplicated within this gene table. Q-PCR on one cuticle clone \nverified that this was upregulated in the Low Group compared to the control animals \n(by 1.3 fold). It should be noted that there were multiple clusters for cuticle proteins, \nrepresenting a multigene family, only one of these was surveyed by Q-PCR. When the \nHigh Group samples were compared to the controls, clones within 6 clusters were \nsignificantly up-regulated (Table 5). All had associated Blast data, with 2 out of the 6 \n(33%) being identified as putatively involved in the respiration and energy \nmetabolism pathways (NADH dehydrogenase and Cytochrome c oxidase). Several of \nthe up-regulated clusters occurred in common between both the Low and the High \nGroup (CHK1: checkpoint homologue, NADH dehydrogenase, secretory protein and \nsenescence associated protein), but it should be remembered that these groups were \neach compared to controls. Q-PCR results verified that CHK-1 was upregulated by \n2.5 fold in the High Group compared to control animals. When the Low and High \nGroup were directly compared, 30 clusters were significantly up-regulated, of which \n13 had putative function assigned via Blast sequence similarity searching (Table 6). \nStructural protein genes predominated with 38% either associated with the cuticle or \nmuscle and a further 23% involved in membrane trafficking. \nWhen the results are considered in terms of which overarching functions are \nproportionally more up regulated in one sample compared to another, then production \nof cuticle protein (Low Group) and protein kinase activity (High Group) (Table 7) are \nhighlighted. When the results of the GO annotation of the Low Group compared to \nthe High Group were analysed, then cuticle proteins predominate along with \nhydrolase activity, which is coupled to catalysing transmembrane movement of \nsubstances. \n 12\nSpringtail array \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese experiments detail the first expression sequence data produced for the Antarctic \nCollembola C. antarcticus. Over half of the EST clones had no significant matches \nwhen searched against the two different databases (TrEMBL and SwissProt) and \ntherefore it was not possible to even putatively assign function to 60% of the data \n(Table 1). This situation is not unusual when producing sequence data from a non-\nmodel organism. Although Drosophila melanogaster was fully sequenced in 2000 \n(Adams et al, 2000), in the current build of ensembl, still only 33.8% of the protein \ncoding gene complement have been characterised, this figure decreases dramatically \nwhen considering the more recently targeted insects Anopheles gambiae and Aedes \naegypti (10.5% and 4.9% of protein coding genes respectively) (www.ensembl.org). \nThe vast majority of data in the public databases is of vertebrate origin and with the \nemphasis on data-mining for medical purposes, these taxa are where most of the \nfunctional annotations lie. Therefore putative functionality of genes in non-model \norganisms initially has to be drawn from vertebrates by analogy and direct sequence \nsimilarity. This clearly is only possible if the genes are highly conserved (many are \nnot, c.f. Family 2 of G-protein couple receptors between vertebrates and invertebrates \n(Cardoso et al, 2006) and even then with high sequence similarity, functionality may \nnot be conserved (c.f. calcitonin between mammals and fish (Clark et al, 2002)). \n \nHowever, there was sufficient annotation of this dataset to be able to draw some \nconclusions about the nature of summer-acclimated cold tolerance in these organisms \n(Tables 4-7). A number of genes\/clones were up-regulated in both groups when \n 13\nSpringtail array \ncompared to controls, such as NADH, cytochrome c and CHK1: a checkpoint \nhomologue involved in the cell cycle, indicating that both sets of animals were \nmetabolically active. However the relative contribution of these clones to each of the \nupregulated datasets varies between the High and the Low Group. The High Group \ncomprises almost exclusively of these types of genes (Table 5). This result combined \nwith that of the proportionally increased GO annotation (Table 7), which highlighted \nserine\/threonine kinases, which are largely involved in cell signalling processes \nindicated a higher level of metabolic activity in this sample of animals. This is in \nagreement with the general understanding, that the High Group contains \nrepresentatives of actively growing and reproducing summer animals, in a period \nwhich is characterised by increased food consumption and energy demand. \n \nThe Low Group, and indeed the Low to High comparison, was dominated by cuticle \nproteins (Table 4 and 6) and this was again reflected in the proportional GO \nannotation results (Table 7). This was accompanied by genes involved in membrane \ntransport, a function, which links to secretion and production of new cuticle. \nInterestingly one of the major genes identified in the Low Group was a 10kDa \nsecretory protein from the Mono Lake bird tick, the function of which is unknown, \nbut was isolated from a salivary gland proteome project (Mans et al, 2008). The \nsecond clone of the list from the Low Group showed sequence similarity to the cupin \nsuperfamily. These proteins are a diverse family involved in isomerase and epimerase \nactivities involved in the modification of cell walls in bacteria, to non-enzymic \nstorage proteins in plant seeds and transcription factors linked to congenital baldness \nin mammals. This is possibly the widest range of biochemical functions of any \nsuperfamily described to date (Dunwell et al, 2001) and so whilst one of the highest \n 14\nSpringtail array \nupregulated clones in the Low Group shows homology to a cupin domain, the protein \ncould do anything, no predictive functions are possible. Clearly an interesting \ncandidate for future studies. \nTaking a broad overview of the results, they correlate with the recent research in \nCollembola (Worland, 2005; Worland et al, 2006, Worland and Convey, 2008) \nsuggesting that moulting could be a process during which SCP is incidentally lowered \nin summer acclimated animals. The pre-moulting stage in Collembola is characterised \nby a fasting period in which a new intestinal epithelium is formed. The epicuticle and \nexocuticle are secreted and just before moulting the old intestinal epithelium is \nrejected (Humbert, 1979). This process could involve complete evacuation of the gut \ncontents and therefore might be expected to decrease the SCP, by reducing the \nnumber of potential ice nucleators in the body of the animal. Collembola moult \nthroughout their lifecycle, with the number of instars ranging from four to more than \n50 (Christiansen, 1990), with up to 40% of a population being in the moulting cycle at \nany time (Leinaas, 1983). However, Worland and Convey (2008) recently showed \nthat the percentage of springtails  involved in ecdysis  increases with decreasing \ntemperatures, such that at 0\u00b0C 80% of the population are potentially involved in \necdysis. Therefore these moulting and non-feeding periods represent a significant \npercentage of both the juvenile and adult life of a collembolan, with potentially strong \nmodifying effects on their supercooling ability, at least in summer months. \nGiven this interpretation of the results, it is important to note that physiologically \nimportant effects may arise from shifts in gene expression that are not picked up at the \nsignificance level of 0.01 adopted in this study. To detect significantly smaller \nchanges in gene expression, a larger study is necessary. It should also be noted that \n 15\nSpringtail array \nchanges in mRNA transcription levels do not necessarily equate to changes in protein \nlevels. However, they provide an indicator of cellular processes affected by the \nconditions under study. It should also be noted that whilst meaningful functions and \necological relevance can be ascribed to the genes identified above, a high percentage \nof clones (approximately 50%) displayed no identifiable homology to known \nsequences. Some of these may well represent critical genes in the biochemical \nprocesses of High and Low Group animals, but more extensive studies, including \ncloning full-length sequences, will be required for putative domain identification and \nfunctional assignment. Of this set of genes, certainly the cluster with sequence \nsimilarity to a cupin domain is of future targeted interest. \n \nProduction of cDNA was problematic for this organism. Although the reason for this \nis unknown, the high level of cuticle pigmentation interfering with the enzymic \nconstruction process is suspected. Therefore it was decided to construct a small \nprototype microarray to determine if meaningful differences in gene expression could \nbe identified between environmental samples of interest in this group. This \npreliminary study provides some very interesting results and justifies further input \ninto this project in the future. The results of this microarray for C. antarcticus, \nprovide evidence for a readily identifiable differential gene expression between \nsummer acclimated High and Low Group animals. The results provide support for the \ntheory that SCP variation within C. antarcticus could be a consequence of \nendogenous physiological processes occurring during moulting, at least in the summer \n(Worland and Convey, 2008). This analysis has provided the basis for further \ninvestigations, such as the production of comprehensive cDNA libraries and a high-\n 16\nSpringtail array \ndensity microarray. This will enable us to conduct more detailed studies and hopefully \nprovide further insights into the extreme environmental adaptation of this species. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was produced within the BAS Q4 BIOREACH\/BIOFLAME core \nprogrammes and also contributes to the SCAR EBA programme.
