At another level they are a means to moving waste scholarship to a fuller \nengagement with materiality.i Our starting point here is a paradox. Waste is intrinsically, \nprofoundly, a matter of materiality and yet \u2013 notwithstanding a sustained engagement with \nmateriality in certain areas of the social sciences of late \u2013 much of what is most readily identified as \nwaste research remains staunchly immaterial. Just as much as societies have sought to distance \nthemselves from and hide their wastes for fear of contamination, so academia has been shy of the \nstuff of waste. Predominantly, social science work identifies waste in terms of waste management; \na move which ensures that waste is defined by, and discussed in terms of, \u2018disposal\u2019 technologies, \nor \u2013 more correctly \u2013 waste treatments, and their connection to policy. The stuff of waste therefore \nis translated into treatment technologies - principally the established ones of incineration and \nlandfill but also emergent technologies such as anaerobic digestion. Or, it is reconfigured as \nresource recovery, that is, as recycling, re-use and re-manufacturing. Thence, for the most part, it is \ntranslated into metrics \u2013 tonnes and targets. To modify Zygmant Bauman\u2019s paraphrasing of Marx, \nwith waste all that is solid (or indeed liquid) tends to melt, if not into air, into the register of the \ncategorical. Further, the radical separation of waste as material and matter from a policy world of \ntonnes and targets inscribes itself into clear academic divisions of labour. Hence, waste in the social \n2 \n \nsciences has hitherto been the primary concern of environmental policy and urban planning, whilst \nstuff and its treatment remains the preserve of the technical and thus the domain of engineering. \nThe matter of waste becomes fixed and limited through management. Caught within a teleological \nfix, that which is managed as waste is waste, and that which is waste is what is managed. \n \nWaste\u2019s identification with waste management, specifically its translation into the categories and \npolicies of waste management, is a manoeuvre which places the field firmly in accord with Latour\u2019s \n\u2018moderns\u2019. In keeping with that we find much work that problematises waste does so at the level of \nthe categorical rather than opening out its ontological politics. So, albeit that there are considerable \ndifferences between work which seeks to evaluate policy outcomes (Davoudi, 2000; Petts, 2000, \n2004) and that which has moved waste debate into the conceptual terrain defined by governance \n(Davoudi, 2009) and governmentality (Fagan, 2004; Bulkeley et al, 2007), these two force fields \nwithin waste scholarship remain firmly in the realms of humans acting on the world (cf. Hillier, \n2009). In the first body of work, the field is defined by end-of-pipe policy, and focuses on the \nidentification of \u2018barriers to\u2019 as the primary means to engage with waste policy. Policy outcomes \nare what matters here, but - as Bulkeley et al (2007) remark - such thinking perpetuates a \u2018linear, \ntechno-economic model\u2019 of the policy process, divorcing policy making from policy intervention. It \nalso, we argue, works to locate waste policy research at the furthest remove of all \u2018end-of-pipe\u2019 \npolicies. In Bulkeley et al\u2019s own work these difficulties are addressed by turning to the literature on \nmodes of governing, with its focus on governmental technologies as deployed by agencies in \ninstitutional relations. Through their analysis of UK municipal waste authorities, Bulkeley et al \nidentify four modes of acting on the world with respect to UK waste \u2013 disposal, diversion, eco-\nefficiency and resource. Yet, notwithstanding its conceptual sophistication, in this work, as in the \n3 \n \nearlier work of Davoudi and Petts, waste just is: it is the stuff that is being governed, or that which \nis the outcome of policy. Black-boxed, manipulated, treated, distributed, and contested, it is policy, \nits categories, governing and campaigning which are the primary agents here, and where all the \ninterest lies.  \nThe focus upon governance can be inverted, to ask how it is that various forms of matter have \ndifferent affordances and become governed differently under different regimes (Gille, 2007). \nAlternately the different incarnations of waste can be used to suggest the situational and relational \ncharacter of the category \u2018waste.\u2019 Far from being fixed in advance, waste is seen as historically \nmutable, geographically contingent and both expressive of social values and sustaining to them. \nSymbolic analysis from Mary Douglas onwards has shown how waste and dirt is defined as impure \nand reputationally damaging. Judith Williamson (1987) elegantly demonstrated this around the \nadverts for a vacuum cleaner, that offered to clean \u2018all three kinds of dirt\u2019 \u2013 where the technology \nmiraculously became the solution to problems posed by its own advertising\u2019s classification of \nuncleanly matter. Here the symbolic comes to define various materials more or less arbitrarily as \nwaste in ways that suite society. But, what is polluting waste in one society may not be treated so in \nanother time and place. From this it flows that categories and social orders use materials but are \nnot determined by those materials. This liberating move from waste as a self-evident category to \nwaste as a social construction therefore begs the question of how different matters matter \ndifferently. \n \nThe symbolically polluting effects of different forms of waste to register and mark social distinction \nhave been richly explored in work drawing on the psychoanalytic tradition. Here work has revealed \na relational ontology, where the normal and healthy is set against the expelled and abject material. \n4 \n \nHowever, that expelled material both reels and fascinates (Laporte, 2002), it has a political charge \nmade possible by its trangressive presence (Hawkins 2003). Conventionally, social organisation is \nabout distancing \u2018decent\u2019 society from its wastes, through technologies that hide, remove and expel \n(Lupton & Miller 1992). The reappearance of waste, in its very social unacceptability thus offers \npotential, so that \u2018When a World Bank official has to examine the virtues of a public toilet and \ndiscuss the merits of this form of shit management with the shitters themselves, the condition of \npoverty moves from abjection to subjectivation. The politics of shit [\u2026] presents a node at which \nconcerns of the human body, dignity, and technology meet\u2019 (Appadurai 2002, page 39). \n \nThe tradition of work on environmental justice combines the sense of reputational and physical \ndanger from wastes in a different way. Here it is not just matter out of place that matters, but \nwaste matter in whose place that counts. From the pioneering African-American homeowners in \nHouston who fought to keep the Whispering Pines landfill out of their suburban middle-income \nneighbourhood, through Love Canal and beyond, studies have shown that the location of waste \nsites and industrial discharge in the US was disproportionately proximate to areas with high \nnumbers of people of colour (Bullard, 1990; Collin and Collin 2005). Environmental justice\u2019s \nemphasis on the hazardous nature of various wastes, then, brings back in the material properties of \ndifferent forms of waste. Those hazards, though, are rendered through cultural (mis-) \nunderstandings and interpretations, which relate physical risk with social noxiousness  in complex \nways. Yet often this becomes a matter of overlaying social analyses on top of physical sciences, \nwhilst preserving their domains of knowledge. \n \n5 \n \nTaking up the mantle of  how to connect the social and the physical within waste scholarship, Gay \nHawkins draws on Jane Bennett\u2019s vital materialist perspective, with its emphasis on thing power, \nassemblage and enchantment, to animate thinking waste through materiality (Hawkins, 2006,2009; \nBennett, 2004a, 2004b). Thinking with that icon of contemporary consumer waste and \nenvironmental degradation, the plastic bottle, through a set of advertising campaign imagery, \nHawkins shows how analysis can move beyond the object as an inert bad thing to see plastic bottles \nas the stuff of politics. Here, the bottle\u2019s materiality proves critical to different political associations. \nWhereas the identification of bottled water with healthy lifestyles, hydration and safe water rests \non blocking out the bottle\u2019s connection to rubbish and to waste, other political associations \nforeground the bottle. One campaign works from plastic\u2019s connection to waste and environmental \nand ecological degradation to make the link to technologies of convenience and the constitution of \nthe ethical self, whilst another mobilises the molecular, turning the bottle and its contents to oil, \nthus emphasising both a narrative of unsustainable production in an over-packaged world and \neffecting an affective disturbance of the act of drinking bottled water.  \n \nIn focusing on the package Hawkins manoeuvre is identical to that of Don DeLillo in Underworld \nwhose character Nick Shay observes:  \n\u201cMarian and I saw products as garbage, even when they sat gleaming on store shelves, \nyet unbought. We didn\u2019t say, What kind of casserole will that make? We said, What kind \nof garbage will that make? Safe, clean, neat, easily disposed of? Can the package be \nrecycled and come back as a tawny envelope that is difficult to lick closed? First we saw \nthe garbage, then we saw the product as food or lightbulbs or dandruff shampoo. How \n6 \n \ndoes it measure up as waste, we asked. We asked whether it is responsible to eat a \ncertain item if the package the item comes in will live a million years.\u201d (1999, p. 121).  \nThis is to decentre the object of commodity fetishism, by thinking not with the point-of-sale \ncommodity but through what enables its distribution. But packaging too is a commodity, and the \nbottle, whilst molecular, is still a thing. Hawkins\u2019 bottles, then, show the potency and the capacity \nof things to capture humans, but they largely stop short of a more radical politics of stuff. Where \nstuff makes an appearance is in the turn to the molecular, and in the affective capacities of an \nadvertising campaign that both reverses chemical processes and performs alchemy, by transmuting \nwater into oil. \n \nThe four papers gathered here share an engagement with Hawkins\u2019 emphasis on the materiality of \nwaste and how it is part of a socio-technical complex \u2013 not an asocial material remainder, nor \nsimple social convention. More strongly, they all insist that waste is a long way from stuff that \u2018just \nis\u2019, but rather that it becomes. In Tim Cooper\u2019s paper we see this becoming in historical perspective.  \nFocusing on England between 1920 and 1960, Cooper provides a carefully crafted narrative of the \nemergence of controlled tipping (or landfill) as the dominant municipal waste disposal technology \nfor the UK in the twentieth-century, showing how this emerged both from the incinerator-led \nRefuse Revolution of 1880 \u2013 1914 and a period at the end of WWI in which recycling and salvage \nwere strongly promoted as alternatives to incineration. A historical perspective shows that \nestablished disposal technologies \u2013 or treatments \u2013 are not one-off interventions in the governance \nof discarded and leftover matter but rather politically stabilised technologies which work to \nreproduce and normalise particular disposal practices, be these located in households, \ncommunities, municipalities, regions or indeed, the nation state. Stabilisations though are always \n7 \n \ncontingent. The significance of this insight from the perspective of the present moment is as \nfollows. The end of the twentieth-century has seen landfill de-stabilised as the UK\u2019s twentieth-\ncentury political settlement with waste, and the waste hierarchy established as the dominant mode \nof thinking about disposal. Waste policy has demonised landfill and promoted recycling, and \nincreasingly re-use, but in a manner not dissimilar to the period at the end of WW1 a pre-eminent \ndisposal technology has yet to emerge for the early twenty-first century. Further, the waste \nhierarchy may have transformed waste to resource, but it has done so by performing a vanishing \ntrick upon the physical remainder of waste. Alongside the secondary raw materials diverted from \nlandfill via recycling technologies and goods with extended social lives, waste still remains; and it \ndoes so because treatment technologies are not, in material terms, disposal technologies - as they \nare presented - but rather transformative technologies and storage\/containment technologies. As \nGabrys (2007), drawing on Benjamin and Buck Morss, reminds us, the residues of treatment \ntechnologies endure; the stuff that is corralled as waste in cells in landfills, incinerated, or just \nopenly dumped, comprises the fossils of the contemporary age.   \n \nThe specific properties of these residues matter intensely to Zsuzsa Gille\u2019s paper. But this stuff is \nnot municipal waste, upon which disproportionate public concern is lavished. Rather, what figures \nempirically here are the wastes of industrial production processes; metal and chemical waste. This \nturn in the direction in waste scholarship is critical. The overwhelming focus in waste research is on \nmunicipal waste, yet this is but a small fraction of the amount of waste produced, most of which is \ngenerated by industry, agriculture and construction activities (Gregson et al, 2007a; O\u2019Brien, 2008). \nAn emphasis on industrial waste or, more graphically, the \u2018shit end of capitalism\u2019, is one of the \npoints that bind Gille\u2019s paper to those of Gregson et al and Crang. All insist that such \u2018shitty\u2019 parts of \n8 \n \nproduction may have been distanced or overlooked but their abject materials return to haunt us. \nAnother link is an insistence on the merits of the concrete specificity of what Gille identifies as \nmicro-level waste scholarship, which she sees as key to the future development of macro-level \nwaste studies. The distinction between micro and macro is not one that is shared by all four of \nthese papers, and indeed a very different scalar imaginary infuses the papers of Gregson et al and \nCrang. But, as a sociologist, Gille wishes to retain this distinction, and she uses it to develop the \nconcept of the waste regime; a means through which the social sciences can acknowledge the \nproduction, circulation and transformation of wastes as physical materials.  At the heart of Gille\u2019s \npaper, then, is a critique of the theorising that has informed social scientific understandings of \neconomies. On the one hand, she exposes the vanishing trick in economists\u2019 models which \u2018make a \nwaste abundant reality conform to a waste-free theoretical world\u2019 - when they factor in waste as \neither products of zero value or useful by-products as outputs with zero inputs \u2013 a view which \ninvites comparison with Donald Mackenzie\u2019s work on derivatives (Mackenzie, 2006) and the \narguments of Daniel Miller (2002) on the virtualism of economic markets driven by models divorced \nfrom material process. On the other hand, she challenges political economy understandings, which \nenvision economies on the basis of value begetting value.  \n \nIf Cooper and Gille\u2019s papers underscore the point that waste becomes \u2013 that it is socially, politically \nand economically generated, and that this is a contingent process \u2013 our second pair of papers \nconnect waste with unbecoming things; in this instance, ships being broken-up at the end of their \neconomic and militarily useful lives, in the EU and in Bangladesh. Rather than emanating from \nwithin the field of waste scholarship, these papers take their cues from the wider debate on \nmateriality within the social sciences and in cultural and aesthetic theory respectively, and push this \n9 \n \nwork into a fuller engagement than hitherto with industrial waste. The work of Gay Hawkins and \nTim Ingold is critical for one manoeuvre, that of Deleuze for another.  \n \nWhilst sympathetic to the arguments of Hawkins and Bennett, in their paper Gregson et al bring \nthese arguments into conversation with the work of Tim Ingold, in particular his insistence on the \nimportance of materials rather than materiality (Ingold, 2007). Ingold\u2019s argument with much of the \nwork on materiality is that it refuses to engage with materials, particularly the corporeality of \nworking practically with materials. Whilst objects capture all the attention, for Ingold materials do \nnot just disappear in the fabrication of the object, indeed their properties and capacities continue \n\u2018to mingle and react as they always have done, forever threatening the things they comprise with \ndissolution or even de-materialisation\u2019 (2007, p 9). Ingold\u2019s examples are classics in the genre of \nmaterial culture studies \u2013 stones and silk. In Gregson et al\u2019s paper, though, we see these insights \nturned to creative destruction, or demolition \u2013 the violent, intensely physical work of purposefully \nbreaking-up large, heterogeneous fabricated things, as an economic activity. Here, things \u2013 in this \ninstance ships - are literally unbecoming, reverting to materials as the object de-materialises. But \u2013 \nas the paper shows \u2013 materials, in this instance asbestos, have profound effects on demolition as an \nactivity; they perform, corporeally and economically. In demonstrating this, Gregson et al\u2019s paper \nresonates with some of the points made by Gille, even whilst it differs in its conceptual positioning. \nDetailed ethnographic work in ship breaking yards is the type of work that Gille\u2019s paper highlights \nas a notable absence from current waste scholarship. This paper takes the methodological \napproach that has enhanced understanding of both consumer disposal practices (Gregson et al \n2007a, 2007b) and waste management work (Reno, 2009) and puts this to work on demolition. In \nso doing, the paper shows that materials, and particularly materials classified as wastes, matter \n10 \n \nprofoundly to demolition, to the bodies and lives of those who do this work, and to the geographies \nof this work. Whilst things, in principle, can un-become anywhere, within the EU the transformative \nacts of demolition animate asbestos, conjoin it with classificatory schemas that define it as \nhazardous waste, that entail codified practices for its removal, and modes of governing its disposal \nto make ship breaking a marginal economic activity. It is this economic logic which ensures that the \nvast majority of commercial ship breaking continues to occur on the beaches of South Asia.   \n \nIf Gregson et al\u2019s focus is on the less than enchanting stuff in unbecoming things, Crang\u2019s paper \ntakes as its primary vehicle a set of images which aestheticise the same category of unbecoming \nthing, ships, but on a beach in Bangladesh. Construing these as counter images of globalisation, \nCrang identifies two key traditions of depicting the wasting processes of global capitalism; a photo-\ndocumentary tradition focused on the labour worlds of creative destruction, exemplified by the \nwork of Sebastian Salgad\u00e3o, and an industrial sublime encapsulated by the remarkable images of \nEdward Burtynsky, in which the emphasis is on an aestheticised materiality.  Following Deleuze, \nCrang reads these latter images as time images; not time through movement, or indeed the decay \nthat characterises work on the ruin, but time as transformations between material states. \nParalleling Gregson, Crang et al (2010), this aesthetic move is argued to mark a move away from a \nfocus on the static object, to see objects as the stilling of relations, rather than \u2013 as here in \nBurtynsky\u2019s images \u2013 things coming into being but also coming apart. And so, in both papers \nbecoming waste is a means to break the focus on the object, to work with a politics of stuff, and to \nmove beyond the identification of becoming and materiality with the affirmative, to insist that \nbecoming is also un-becoming, literally and adjectivally as well as corporeally, that unbecoming \n11 \n \nthings may be less than enchanting stuff, and \u2013 more politically - that this unbecoming world is the \nworld on which our comfortable lives depend.  \n \nCollectively, then, the papers gathered here show not just that materiality matters to the \ndevelopment of waste scholarship but that a focus on industrial waste matters to the development \nof work on materiality. Ranging across diverse geographically imaginations \u2013 scalar national, scalar \nlocal, scalar regulatory and scalar globalised \u2013 they show too how the geographies of waste \nscholarship might move beyond their traditional locus of the municipality, the region and the \nnation state. Thus Cooper tells a story of flows of knowledge sequestering noxious materials in \nspaces that can successfully symbolically, if not always materially, contain them; Gille speaks of \nnational level policies that use economic categories to try to fix what is waste and thus create new \nproblematic residues; Gregson et al. look at the localisation produced by categorisation, skills, and \nsequestration in handling hazardous materials in ways to prevent their unleashing; while Crang \ncharts the flows of those very same materials across boundaries, to where different assemblages of \ncategories, skills and economies do unleash those hazards and sees their transformation not only \ninto new stuff but also into icons and images that travel back. To focus on unbecoming things \nforegrounds sequestering, unleashing, the transgression of boundaries and borders, and positions \nwaste firmly within a scalar world of fixings and flows. As significantly, it signals the vitality of the \ninorganic within a networked world.  \n \nReferences \n12 \n \nAppadurai, A.

Two papers from that session (Cooper, Gille) \nappear here; a third (Hawkins, 2009) was already committed to another journal, but since it formed a key part of that \nsession we discuss it here. To that suite of papers we have added two further papers, from work conducted under The \nWaste of the World programme.   \n"}
