Concerns that unelected and unrepresentative judges are \u2018legislating\u2019 \nrather than interpreting the law or are interfering in matters of \u2018democratically-endorsed\u2019 \ngovernment policy, have often been, and will continue to be, raised by academics and \npoliticians alike.1  The question is one of separation of power \u2013 of the appropriate \nconstitutional role and division of functions between the executive, judicial and \nlegislative branches of the United Kingdom government.  This debate has been given a \nnew dimension by the Human Rights Act 1998 (hereafter HRA), most obviously through \nthe courts\u2019 exercise of their power under section 3(1) of that Act \u2013 the duty to interpret \nprimary and secondary legislation to be, as far as possible, compatible with \u2018the \nConvention rights.\u20192  And indeed much has been made of the unique method by which \n                                                 \n\u2217 Human Rights Centre, Department of Law, University Of Durham.  The research on which this piece was \nbased was undertaken as part of the AHRB-funded project, \u2018Judicial Reasoning and the Human Rights Act \n1998.\u2019  I am grateful to Helen Fenwick and Gavin Phillipson for their extensive comments on earlier drafts.  \nThe phrase \u2018municipal law of human rights\u2019 is taken from the judgment of Laws LJ in Runa Begum v \nTower Hamlets London [2002] 2 All ER 668, para 17: \u2018\u2026 the court\u2019s task under the HRA \u2026 is not simply \nto add on the Strasbourg learning to the corpus of English law, as if it were a compulsory adjunct taken \nfrom an alien source, but to develop a municipal law of human rights by the incremental method of the \ncommon law, case by case, taking account of the Strasbourg jurisprudence as HRA s.2 enjoins us to do.\u2019   \n1 JAG Griffith The Politics of the Judiciary (Fontana Press London 1991) chapters 8 and 9; R Stevens The \nEnglish Judges (Hart Publishing Oxford 2002) chapter 5; A Bradley \u2018Judicial Independence Under Attack\u2019 \n[2003] PL 397.   \n2 \u2018The Convention Rights\u2019 are defined in s 1(1) HRA and include Arts 2-12 and 14 of the Convention, Arts \n1-3 of the First Protocol and Arts 1 and 2 of the Sixth Protocol; the \u2018Convention Rights\u2019 are to be read with \nArts 16-18 of the Convention.  The discussion which follows should be taken as referring to the \ninterpretation in the domestic context of those rights included in s 1(1) HRA; as regards those parts of the \nConvention which are not given \u2018further effect\u2019 through the HRA \u2013 for example Art 1 \u2013 it is entirely \n 1\nthe HRA reconciles the interpretative obligation under section 3(1) with the sovereignty \nof Parliament by way of the \u2018declaration of incompatibility\u2019 under section 4.3  The \ndoctrine of parliamentary sovereignty imposes limits the scope of section 3(1); in spite of \nits \u2018broad and malleable\u20194 language, which might permit \u2018an interpretation which \nlinguistically may appear strained,\u20195 does not sanction courts to act as legislators.6  As \nLord Nicholls of Birkenhead noted in Re S; Re W, attributing to a statutory provision, \u2018a \nmeaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament \nis likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment.\u20197  That \ncase has been seen by some as a retreat from what has been termed the \u2018farfetched\u2019 \ninterpretation of section 3(1) adopted by the House of Lords in the earlier decision of R v \nA.8  Nicol, for one, has argued that Re S; Re W and Anderson9 taken together, clearly \nreject \u2018the notion that \u201cinterpretations\u201d could conflict with clear statutory words\u2019 \u2013 as R v \nA had arguably suggested \u2013 thereby endorsing parliamentary sovereignty, above the \nConvention, \u2018as the country\u2019s supreme constitutional doctrine.\u201910  For it to retain its \nlegitimacy therefore, the judicial act under section 3(1) therefore needs to remain an \n                                                                                                                                                 \narguable that a closer adherence to the Strasbourg case-law than advocated in the following might be \nappropriate: on which see R (on the application of Al-Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence [2005] HRLR \n3.   \n3 On which see: C Gearty \u2018Reconciling Parliamentary Democracy and Human Rights\u2019 (2002) 118 LQR \n248.

Cf A \nKavanagh \u2018Statutory interpretation and human rights after Anderson: A more contextual approach\u2019 [2004] \nPL 537. \n 2\nexercise of \u2018interpretation\u2019: to attribute a meaning to a legislative provision \u2018quite \ndifferent from that which Parliament intended \u2026 would go well beyond any \ninterpretative process sanctioned by section 3 of the 1998 Act\u2019.11  It would \u2018not be \njudicial interpretation but judicial vandalism.\u201912   \nIt would however, be a mistake to confine discussion of the legitimacy of the \njudicial role under the HRA to the reaches of sections 3(1) and 4 alone, since section 2(1) \nalso allows the court a significant margin of discretion.  Although the overt purpose of \nthe Act is to \u2018give further effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights\u2019, domestic courts are neither bound to strictly \n\u2018follow\u2019 or \u2018apply\u2019 the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.13  Under \nsection 2(1) of the Act, courts and tribunals have a duty to \u2018take into account\u2019 the \njurisprudence of the Strasbourg institutions in adjudication under the Act: a duty which, \nprima facie, does not appear to guarantee adherence to that case-law in practice, \u2018since it \nis open to the judiciary to consider, but disapply a particular decision.\u201914  The courts\u2019 \nduty, under section 6(1) and 6(3)(a), to act compatibly, ensures that a direct conflict with \nthe principles of the Convention rights themselves is unlikely to result from a decision \nunder the Act; to provide a protection below the minimum standard afforded by \nStrasbourg would be an apparent contravention of those provisions.  But it is this duty, to \nonly \u2018take into account\u2019 the Convention case-law, coupled with the nature of that \njurisprudence, that brings a new perspective to the idea of maintaining legitimacy in \njudicial decision-making.   \nSection 2(1) gives the Convention jurisprudence the effect of persuasive authority \nin domestic law.  The court\u2019s discretion therefore lies in the degree of consideration to \nafford to the Strasbourg authority.  Certain characteristics of the \u2018relevant\u2019 authority, or \ncircumstances of the case in hand, may lead the court to place differing degrees of \nreliance on decisions of the Strasbourg organs \u2013 in deciding whether or not to take into \n                                                 \n11 Anderson (n 9) para 30, per Lord Bingham.   \n12 ibid.   \n13 Although questions of \u2018compatibility\u2019 under s 3(1) and s 6(1) are determined by reference to \u2018the \nConvention rights.\u2019   \n14 H Fenwick Civil Liberties and Human Rights (3rd Ed) (Cavendish London 2002) 146-147.   \n 3\naccount seeming conflicting decisions of the Commission and the European Court of \nHuman Rights a domestic court might legitimately decide to give more weight to the \ndecision of the European Court as the superior and final court of review.  Equally, \nconsiderations of time are apt \u2013 the effect of the Convention may alter over time; it is a \n\u2018living instrument\u2019 to be given a \u2018dynamic interpretation in the light of conditions \nprevailing at the time a matter falls to be considered.\u201915  Domestic courts might therefore \nalso afford increased weight to a recent decision of the Grand Chamber of the European \nCourt than to, say, a decision of the Court handed down 20 years ago.  Although this \nhierarchy has been acknowledged in the domestic jurisprudence under the HRA, courts \nhave tended to focus on the issue of whether or not to follow the relevant decision or \ndecisions in question.16   \nIn terms of the construction of s.2(1) the courts\u2019 obligation would appear to be \nsatisfied by simply considering the Strasbourg authority put before it; having taken the \ndecision into account it would not be obliged to follow or apply its reasoning.  But the \nchallenge laid down to the domestic judiciary lies in those areas in which the Strasbourg \nauthorities cannot simply be \u2018followed\u2019: whether because a wide margin of appreciation \nhas been afforded, that the relevant decisions of the Strasbourg court do not define the \ncontent of the right in question, or simply because of the fact that \u2018decisions of the \nEuropean Court are not infrequently Delphic in character.\u201917  It is in these areas that the \nquestion of maintaining legitimacy in judicial decisions arises; if sufficient direction \ncannot be gleaned from the Convention case-law, to where is the domestic judge to look \nfor guidance?  \nThis piece argues that the HRA need not simply be an instrument for achieving \nmere compatibility with the Strasbourg standard of those rights given effect through that \nAct.  The view taken is that the HRA should be used as a mechanism not only for the \n                                                 \n15 S Grosz, J Beatson and P Duffy Human Rights: The 1998 Act and the European Convention (Sweet and \nMaxwell London 2000) 18.    \n16 R Masterman \u2018Section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998: Binding domestic courts to Strasbourg?\u2019 \n[2004] PL 725, 731-735.   \n17 ATH Smith \u2018The Human Rights Act: the Constitutional Context\u2019 in Cambridge Centre for Public Law \nThe Human Rights Act and the Criminal Justice and Regulatory Process (Hart Publishing Oxford 1999) 6.   \n 4\n\u2018maintenance\u2019 of the Convention rights in domestic law, but also for the \u2018further \nrealisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2019, a view which, it is argued, finds \nsupport in both the Parliamentary debates on the Human Rights Bill and in the \nConvention itself.18  If the HRA is a tool designed to facilitate the development of a \ndomestic law of human rights grounded in \u2013 and sensitive to \u2013 Convention law and \nprinciples then the courts will increasingly need to have regard to alternate sources of \nauthority, sources that compensate for the limitations of the Strasbourg case-law.  But an \nincreasing reliance on wider authority might also lead to accusations of exceeding the \npower conferred on the judiciary by the HRA.  The Act explicitly states that questions of \ncompatibility in relation to legislation, and of lawfulness, in relation to executive acts19 \nare to be gauged by reference to \u2018the Convention rights\u2019; an increased regard to alternate \nsources of authority \u2013 to the exclusion of the Convention and its jurisprudence \u2013 would \nresult in significant difficulties for the application of sections 3(1), 4 and 6(1) for \nexample.   \nThe first part of this piece suggests that taking a progressive stance to the \nConvention rights under the HRA is legitimised by the fact that the Convention is a \n\u2018living instrument\u2019, by the position of the HRA itself as a \u2018Constitutional statute\u2019 in \ndomestic law, and by the unsuitability of the Strasbourg jurisprudence to simply be \ntransposed into domestic law.  Secondly, this piece attempts to illustrate a number of \nareas in which the domestic courts are adopting a \u2018generous and purposive\u2019 approach to \nthe interpretation of the HRA \u2013 by looking to sources of authority beyond the Strasbourg \njurisprudence \u2013 and in doing so are simultaneously addressing some of the limitations of \nthe ECHR as a template for a domestic human rights jurisprudence.  It is in these areas \nthat we may be seeing the emergence of what might be called a \u2018municipal law of human \nrights.\u2019   \n \n                                                 \n18 The preamble to the ECHR contains the following: \u2018Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is \nthe achievement of greater unity between its members and that one of the methods by which that aim is to \nbe pursued is the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u2019   \n19 Section 6(1) HRA. \n 5\nI.

The European Court of Human Rights has consistently stated that the \nConvention is a \u2018living instrument which \u2026 must be interpreted in the light of present \nday conditions.\u201920  Thus the Strasbourg Court is not formally bound to follow its own \njudgments21 \u2013 allowing the Court to \u2018have regard to the changing conditions in \ncontracting states and respond \u2026 to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be \nachieved.\u201922  The precise content of or, perhaps more accurately, the minimum level of \nprotection afforded by a Convention right may therefore develop over time.23  That the \nConvention itself assumes that domestic courts will also take a progressive approach to \nthe rights and fundamental freedoms it contains is evident from the wording of the \npreamble to the ECHR, particularly in its reference to the \u2018further realisation\u2019 of the \nrights and freedoms it provides.  The laying down of minimum standards demonstrates \nnot only that, in the view of the Strasbourg institutions, there is no requirement of a pan-\nEuropean standard across the range of rights afforded, but also that States parties should \nbe free to develop an enhanced protection within their national legal systems (without \nfalling below an \u2018irreducible minimum which will be monitored by the Strasbourg \ninstitutions\u2019).24  In the Convention system, the domestic authorities of the States parties \nare primarily responsible for upholding the Convention rights \u2013 with the Convention \ninstitutions themselves providing a secondary, or supervisory, layer of protection \u2013 as the \nEuropean Court noted in its judgment in the Handyside case:  \n \n                                                 \n20 Tyrer v United Kingdom (1979-80) 2 EHRR 1, para 30.   \n21 See eg Cossey v United Kingdom (1991) 13 EHRR 622, para 35.   \n22 Stafford v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 32, para 68.   \n23 That the Convention is a \u2018living instrument\u2019 has been acknowledged by domestic courts in litigation \nunder the HRA: see eg Brown v Stott [2003] 1 AC 681, 727, per Lord Clyde.    \n24 Grosz, Beatson and Duffy (n 15) 20.  See also Handyside v United Kingdom (1979-1980) 1 EHRR 737, \npara 49.    \n 6\n\u2026 the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the \nnational systems regarding human rights \u2026 by reason of their direct and \ncontinuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in \nprinciple in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the \nexact content of these requirements as well as on the \u2018necessity\u2019 of a \u2018restriction\u2019 \nor \u2018penalty\u2019 intended to meet them.25    \n \nAnd it is not only on the executive or legislative branches that this burden of progressive \ndevelopment falls; as Judge Martens, formerly of the European Court of Human Rights \nhas observed, the role of the domestic judiciary under the Convention system: \u2018 \u2026 goes \nfurther than seeing to it that the minimum standards in the ECHR are maintained.  That is \nbecause the ECHR\u2019s injunction to further realise human rights and fundamental freedoms \ncontained in the preamble is also addressed to domestic courts.\u201926  This view may go so \nfar as to suggest that the obligation on national authorities to further the Convention\u2019s \n\u2018minimum\u2019 standards \u2013 to take more than a minimalist, or mere compatibility approach \u2013 \nexists independently of the provisions of the HRA itself.  But nevertheless, that the \nLabour Government intended the domestic courts to take a purposive approach to the \nConvention rights under the HRA is apparent from the Parliamentary debates on the \nHuman Rights Bill.   \nIn rejecting a Conservative amendment which would have replaced the words \n\u2018must take into account\u2019 with \u2018shall be bound by\u2019 in Clause 2 of the Bill, the then Lord \nChancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, identified three reasons why the domestic judiciary \nshould not be bound to follow the decisions of the Strasbourg institutions.  The first was \nthat the Convention itself, rather than the decisions of the Strasbourg bodies, was the \n\u2018ultimate source of the relevant law.\u201927  Secondly, under the terms of the Convention, the \nUnited Kingdom is only strictly bound to \u2018abide by\u2019 decisions of the Strasbourg court in \n                                                 \n25 Handyside v United Kingdom (n 24) para 48.   \n26 Judge Sibrand Karel Martens \u2018Incorporating the European Convention: the role of the judiciary\u2019 (1998) \nEHRLR 5, 14.   \n27 HL Deb vol 583 col 514 18 November 1997.   \n 7\ncases in which it has been involved as a party to the proceedings.28  Finally, and most \nimportantly when considering whether domestic courts should adopt a progressive or \ncompatibility-only approach to the Convention standards, Lord Irvine proposed that \u2018our \ncourts must be free to give a lead to Europe as well as to be led.\u201929  When the Bill \nreached Report Stage he elaborated on this, saying:  \n                                                \n \nThe courts will often be faced with cases that involve factors perhaps specific to \nthe United Kingdom which distinguish them from cases considered by the \nEuropean Court \u2026 it is important that our courts have the scope to apply that \ndiscretion so as to aid the development of human rights law.30    \n \nThe Parliamentary debates give few hints as to the specific circumstances in which a \ndomestic court might legitimately depart from Strasbourg jurisprudence; but for \ndetermining the question of whether a purposive approach to the Convention rights under \nthe Act was envisaged, the very fact that domestic courts are not bound to follow or apply \nthe Strasbourg jurisprudence seems to point towards a positive answer.31   \n That the HRA might be used as a tool for the development of domestic common \nlaw standards is not in doubt; Lord Irvine, for example, saw the HRA as a tool which \nmight, over time, enable the common law to fashion a right of privacy based on Article 8 \n \n28 ibid.  Art 46(1) ECHR provides: \u2018The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment \nof the Court in any case to which they are the parties.\u2019  Art 46(2) provides the task of supervising the \nexecution of such a judgment is exercised by the Committee of Ministers.   \n29 ibid.   \n30 HL Deb vol 584 cols 1270-1271 19 January 1998. \n31 The House of Lords seems to have in general adopted quite a strict approach to the issue of \u2018following\u2019 \nStrasbourg decisions.  The following quote from Lord Bingham is a typical example: \u2018In my opinion, even \nif the United Kingdom courts are only to take account of the Strasbourg decisions and are not strictly bound \nby them (s.2 of the Human Rights Act 1998), where the Court has laid down principles and, as here a \nminimum threshold requirement, United Kingdom courts should follow what the court has said.  If they do \nso without good reason the dissatisfied litigant has a right to go to Strasbourg where existing jurisprudence \nis likely to be followed.\u2019  (R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Amin [2004] 1 AC \n653, para 44).   \n 8\nand its jurisprudence.32  That the rights conferred by domestic courts under the Act could \nbe more limited than those afforded by the European Court of Human Rights is \nseemingly prohibited by section 2(1) and 6(1) HRA taken together \u2013 since the domestic \ncourt would be acting incompatibly with the European Court\u2019s conception of the \nConvention right at stake.33  But refusing to oblige domestic courts to follow the relevant \nStrasbourg decisions not only allows courts under the HRA to assert Convention rights in \ndomestic law, but opens up the possibility of \u2018developing a domestic jurisprudence under \nthe Convention which may be more generous to applicants than that dispensed at \nStrasbourg, while remaining broadly consistent with it.\u201934  In consequence, some \ncommentators have argued that the courts\u2019 duty under section 2(1) was the legislative \nprovision which had the potential to turn the HRA into a \u2018Bill of Rights\u2019 for the United \nKingdom.35 \n \nB.   A \u2018Constitutional Statute\u2019 \nFurthermore, as Richard Clayton QC has observed,36 the HRA is a \u2018constitutional statute\u2019 \n\u2013 a legislative measure which, as defined by Laws LJ in Thoburn, either \u2018(a) conditions \nthe legal relationship between the citizen and the state in some general, overarching \nmanner, or (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we now regard as fundamental \nconstitutional rights\u201937 \u2013 a view which has received support from the House of Lords in \n                                                 \n32 HL Deb vol 595 col 784-786 24 November 1997.   \n33 R (on the application of Ullah) v Special Adjudicator; Do v Immigration Appeal Tribunal [2004] UKHL \n26, para 20, per Lord Bingham.    \n34 Grosz, Beatson and Duffy (n 15) 20.  A possibility which has been recognised in domestic litigation: \u2018 \u2026 \nso there can be situations where the standards of respect for the rights of the individual in this jurisdiction \nare higher than those required by the Convention.  There is nothing in the Convention setting a ceiling on \nthe level of respect which a jurisdiction is entitled to extend to personal rights\u2019 (R (on the application of S) \nv Chief Constable of South Yorkshire; R (on the application of Marper) v Chief Constable of South \nYorkshire [2003] 1 All ER 148, 157-158, per Lord Woolf). \n35 F Klug \u2018The Human Rights Act\u2014A \u201cThird Way\u201d or \u201cThird Wave\u201d Bill of Rights\u2019 (2001) EHRLR 361, \n370; D Bonner, H Fenwick and S Harris-Short \u2018Judicial Approaches to the Human Rights Act\u2019 (2003) 52 \nICLQ 549, 553.   \n36 Clayton (n 4) 33-34.   \n37 Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2003] QB 151, para 62.   \n 9\nHRA cases.38  Thus, \u2018relatively strict methods of interpretation\u2019 may not be suitable, as \n\u2018constitutional adjudication needs to be approached generously in order to afford citizens \nthe full measure of the protections of a Bill of Rights.\u201939  And, as Clayton suggests, \n\u2018constitutional\u2019 instruments have, in the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the \nPrivy Council, consequently been afforded a \u2018generous and purposive\u2019 interpretation.40  \nIn his commentary on the movement away from the \u2018austerity of tabulated legalism\u2019 in \nthe jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee, Ewing has written of the decision in \nMinister of Home Affairs v Fisher: \n \nLord Wilberforce thought it was appropriate to point out that the Privy Council \nwas \u2018concerned with a Constitution\u2019 which had \u2018certain special characteristics\u2019 \nwhich included the fact that it was \u2018drafted in a broad and ample style\u2019 and was \n\u2018greatly influenced by\u2019 the European Convention on Human Rights.  These \nconsiderations called for a generous interpretation \u202641 \n \nThe parallels are clear: the HRA is a \u2018constitutional instrument\u2019 in the terms of the \nEnglish common law; it is \u2018expressed in the open-textured language appropriate to a \n                                                 \n38 See eg Brown v Stott (n 23) 703, per Lord Bingham.   \n39 Lord Steyn, \u2018The New Legal Landscape\u2019 [2000] EHRLR 549, 550. \n40 On which see KD Ewing, \u2018A Bill of Rights: Lessons from the Privy Council\u2019 in W Finnie, CMG \nHimsworth and N Walker (eds) Edinburgh Essays in Public Law (Edinburgh University Press Edinburgh \n1991) 236-241.   \n41 ibid., 238-239.  In that case Lord Wilberforce outlined the \u2018generous and purposive\u2019 approach to be taken \nsuggesting that it would, \u2018treat a constitutional instrument such as this sui generis, calling for principles of \ninterpretation of its own, suitable to its character \u2026 without necessary acceptance of all the presumptions \nthat are relevant to legislation of private law.\u2019  He continued, \u2018[r]espect must be paid to the language which \nhas been used and to the traditions and usages which have given meaning to that language.  It is quite \nconsistent with this, and with the recognition that rules of interpretation may apply, to take as a point for \ndeparture for the process of interpretation a recognition of the character and origin of the instrument, and to \nbe guided by the principle of giving full recognition and effect to those fundamental rights and freedoms \nwith a statement of which the constitution commences\u2019 (Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher [1980] AC 319, \n329).    \n 10\nconstitutional charter\u201942; and to suggest that an Act, the manifest purpose of which was to \n\u2018give further effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention \non Human Rights\u2019 was not \u2018greatly influenced by\u2019 that document could hardly be \ncountenanced.  In a number of decisions under the HRA this \u2018generous and purposive\u201943 \napproach to its interpretation has been recognised as correct \u2013 Kebilene44 and Brown v \nStott45 are two examples \u2013 and yet as Clayton has observed: \n \n[t]he English courts have not so far laid any particular emphasis on the \nimportance of interpreting the [Human Rights] Act generously.  In fact, there is an \nobvious tension between the courts giving effect to the HRA as a constitutional \ninstrument and avoiding the charge of excessive judicial activism.46 \n \nC.  Using Strasbourg as a template for a domestic human rights jurisprudence \nThis tension is exacerbated by the fact that the Convention and its jurisprudence demand \nof the domestic judiciary a more creative intervention than that required by the \napplication of a statutory provision to a given set of circumstances.  The deficiencies of \nthe Convention and its case-law as a basis of a domestic human rights jurisprudence are \nthreefold: firstly there is the relative weakness of the Convention itself as a statement of \npositive rights; secondly there is a tendency towards paucity in the Convention \njurisprudence in respect of actually defining the content of the rights it protects; finally, \nthere is the application of the margin of appreciation.   \nAs to the first of these limitations, it is the structure of the Convention itself, and \nthe exceptions to the rights provided, which provides a hindrance to its direct application \nin domestic law.  As Ewing and Gearty have written: \n                                                 \n42 A Lester \u2018The Human Rights Act 1998 \u2013 Five Years On\u2019 [2004] EHRLR 258, 259-260.  \n43 It should be noted that there has been some disagreement over the appropriateness of giving the \nConvention rights themselves a \u2018generous\u2019 interpretation: see D Pannick \u2018Principles of interpretation of \nConvention rights under the Human Rights Act and the discretionary area of judgment\u2019 [1998] PL 545; RA \nEdwards, \u2018Generosity and the Human Rights Act: the right interpretation? [1999] PL 400.   \n44 R v DPP, ex parte Kebilene [2000] 2 AC 326, 375, per Lord Hope.   \n45 Brown v Stott (n 23) 703, per Lord Bingham.   \n46 Clayton (n 4) 34.   \n 11\n It is well known that the terms of the Convention are extremely vague, with most \nfreedoms enjoying only qualified protection and with much depending on such \nvague phrases as \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019, \u2018pressing social need\u2019 and \nproportionality.47 \n \nAs to the condition that a restriction be \u2018necessary in a democratic society,\u2019 the European \nCourt of Human Rights has offered some assistance in defining the meaning of this \nnebulous phrase, ruling out the \u2018flexibility of such expressions as \u201cadmissible\u201d, \n\u201cordinary\u201d, \u201cuseful\u201d, \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cdesirable\u201d\u2019 and noting that it implied the existence \n\u2013 rather circuitously \u2013 of a \u2018pressing social need.\u201948  But even with such guidance, as \nLord Irvine has written of the nature of human rights instruments more generally, \u2018their \nlinguistic texture and their evolutive nature necessarily leave the judges with a significant \nmargin of interpretative autonomy.\u201949   \n This \u2018interpretative autonomy\u2019 will be constrained to an extent by the courts\u2019 duty \nto \u2018have regard\u2019 to the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg bodies, but, as suggested above, \nthe nature of the Strasbourg case-law itself ensures that there will remain scope for a \ncertain degree of judicial creativity on the part of the domestic judge.  In part this may be \nattributable to the fact that many such decisions of the Strasbourg organs are not suitable \nto be applied or followed in strict terms.  Judgments of the European Court of Human \nRights are \u2018essentially declaratory\u201950 in nature, stating whether a given decision, action or \nomission of the national authorities in question is either compatible with, or in breach of, \nthe Convention standards (or falls within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation).

While States may experiment (by conceding \nmore to individuals then the Convention presently requires), other states will not \nbe compelled to imitate the innovation; but if they follow suit voluntarily, there \nmay come a time when the laggards will be held to be in breach of their \nConvention obligations.53   \n \nThe margin of appreciation afforded in a given area \u2013 taken with the status of the \nConvention as a \u2018living instrument\u2019 \u2013 may make it increasingly likely that the range of \npermissible responses or restrictions may accordingly differ from one State to the next \nover time.  Domestic courts should therefore take care to note those cases in which a \nState has been afforded a margin of appreciation and on which they are asked to place \n                                                 \n51 ibid., where the example given is of Vermeire v Belgium (1993) 15 EHRR 488.   \n52 Smith (n 17) 6.   \n53 C Warbrick \u2018\u201cFederal\u201d aspects of the European Convention on Human Rights\u2019 (1989) 10 Michigan \nJournal of International Law 698, 715-716. \n 13\nreliance.54  As the application of the doctrine inherently involves a degree of respect for \nthe judgment of the national decision-maker \u2013 one which takes into account the \nprevailing circumstances in that State55 \u2013 domestic courts would be advised not to adopt \nunquestioningly similar reasoning without noting the breadth of the margin afforded in \nsuch circumstances, especially where the judgment of the Strasbourg authorities is \naddressed to another State party.  As Fenwick and Phillipson have suggested, in the \ncontext of direct action protest, the tendency of the Strasbourg institutions to afford a \nwide margin of appreciation to States parties has a number of consequences:  \n \nReview of the \u2018necessity\u2019 of State interferences is not intensive, at times \nappearing to be confined to ensuring actions were taken in good faith and were \nnot manifestly unreasonable \u2026 States are typically not required to demonstrate \nthat lesser measures than those actually taken would have been inadequate to deal \nwith the threats posed \u2026 the effect of this \u2018light touch\u2019 review may also be seen \nin the tendency to deal with crucial issues \u2013 typically proportionality, but also in \nsome cases the scope of the primary right \u2013 in such a brusque and abbreviated \nmanner that explication of the findings is either non-existent or takes the form of \nmere assertion.56 \n \nThis is not to say that the domestic judiciary cannot gain any enlightenment through \nrecourse to such decisions \u2013 simply that the margin of appreciation is a further factor to \nbe \u2018taken into account\u2019 when determining the degree of reliance to be placed upon a \njudgment or opinion by a domestic court in coming to its decision.   \n \nD.

In the absence of special circumstances it seems to me that the court \nshould follow any clear and constant jurisprudence of the European Court of \nHuman Rights.  If it does not do so there is at least a possibility that the case will \ngo to that court which is likely in the ordinary case to follow its own constant \njurisprudence.58   \n \nAnd while it could be suggested that the phrase \u2018clear and constant\u2019 actually gives courts \nconsiderable scope to depart from Strasbourg case-law \u2013 in particular in an area where \nthat jurisprudence is rapidly developing59 \u2013 in the absence of guidance as to what might \namount to \u2018special circumstances\u201960 the possibility of lower courts unquestioningly \nadopting the relevant reasoning of Strasbourg is quite real.  While Clapham recognises \nthis constrained approach as one of the potential hazards of transposing an international \ntreaty into a national \u2018bill of rights,\u2019 it also brings with it the potential both to frustrate the \nobject of the ECHR itself \u2013 the \u2018further realisation\u2019 of the Convention rights \u2013 and of the \n                                                 \n57 Masterman (n 16).   \n58 R (on the application of Alconbury Developments Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, \nTransport and the Regions [2003] 2 AC 295, para 26.

This may be a particular problem where \u2018no \ninternational consensus emerges regarding the standard to be applied\u2019; as Clapham has \nwritten:  \n \n\u2026 the problem is that judges or Governments may be tempted to point to such \nminimum standards as evidence of the limits of the human rights at stake.  The \nchallenge is to ensure that national courts treat the international human rights as a \npart of the national heritage and interpret them in the national context so as to \ngive the appropriate maximum protection at the national level \u2026 It is important \nthat national courts have the autonomy to interpret the relevant international \nhuman rights so as to make them appropriate to the national culture.61  \n \nThis is not to suggest that the domestic courts under the HRA have ruled out the \npossibility of adopting a more expansive approach to the Convention rights where \nappropriate,62 but simply to suggest that an overly slavish attitude to the Convention \njurisprudence, perpetuated by an adherence to the language of precedent, makes it highly \nunlikely.  And indeed, despite an apparent acceptance that the HRA is deserving of a \n\u2018generous and purposive\u2019interpretation, recent decisions in the House of Lords have \nindicated that this may not extend so far as to develop an enhanced protection \u2013 beyond \n                                                 \n61 A Clapham \u2018The European Convention on Human Rights in the British Courts: Problems Associated \nwith the Incorporation of International Human Rights\u2019 in P Alston (ed) Promoting Human Rights Through \nBills of Rights (Oxford University Press Oxford 1999) 134-135.   \n62 Although some judicial comment seems to indicate that although national courts might have the \nautonomy to give \u2018maximum protection\u2019 to the international standards at the domestic level, they would not \nnecessarily do so if that means going beyond the \u2018Strasbourg standard\u2019: \u2018 \u2026 it is of course open to member \nstates to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the Convention, but such provision \nshould not be the product of interpretation of the Convention by national courts, since the meaning of the \nConvention should be uniform throughout the States party to it.  The duty of national courts is to keep pace \nwith the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less\u2019 (Ullah (n 33) para \n20, per Lord Bingham).   \n 16\nthat offered by the Convention \u2013 to the Convention rights in domestic law, where that \ndoes not already exist.63   \n An approach to the courts\u2019 duty in section 2(1) HRA which is arguably less \ninclined to simply \u2018follow any clear and constant jurisprudence\u2019 of the Strasbourg \ninstitutions can be found in the dicta of Laws LJ:  \n \n\u2026 the court\u2019s task under the HRA \u2026 is not simply to add on the Strasbourg \nlearning to the corpus of English law, as if it were a compulsory adjunct taken \nfrom an alien source, but to develop a municipal law of human rights by the \nincremental method of the common law, case by case, taking account of the \nStrasbourg jurisprudence as HRA s.2 enjoins us to do.64 \n \nThe reasoning of Laws LJ has received some support from Sir Andrew Morritt VC in the \nCourt of Appeal: \u2018[o]ur task is not to cast around in the European Human Rights Reports \nlike blackletter lawyers seeking clues.  In the light of s.2(1) of the Human Rights Act \n1998 it is to draw out the broad principles which animate the Convention.\u201965  This \napproach takes a more holistic view of the Convention jurisprudence, aiming to draw on \nthe principles which underpin the Convention and its case-law rather than attempting to \napply or follow individual decisions.  In terms of the interpretation of constitutional \ndocuments this approach also receives support from the jurisprudence of the Judicial \nCommittee of the Privy Council  \n \n                                                 \n63 ibid., see also R v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, ex parte LS; R v Chief Constable of South \nYorkshire, ex parte Marper [2004] UKHL 39, para 27, per Lord Steyn, para 66, per Lord Rodger, and para \n78, per Baroness Hale.   \n64 Runa Begum v Tower Hamlets London [2002] 2 All ER 668, para 17.

Respect must be paid to the \nlanguage which has been used and to the traditions and usages which have given \nmeaning to that language.66  \n \nBy not treating relevant Strasbourg authority as equivalent to binding precedent, this \ninterpretation of the court\u2019s duty under section 2(1) may open up the possibility of \nadopting a less deferential attitude to the \u2018clear and constant\u2019 jurisprudence of the \nConvention organs, and might require the court to assert why a decision is suitable to be \n\u2018followed\u2019 or \u2018applied\u2019 in the domestic context.   \nIn other words, in constitutional interpretation and adjudication it may not be \nsufficient to look to individual decisions in the abstract.  Equal attention must be paid to \nthe aims of the document in question \u2013 in the case of the Convention the maintenance and \nfurther realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the preservation of \neffective political democracy67 \u2013 and to the values enshrined in that document \u2013 \npluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, the rule of law with access to the courts, and \nfreedom of expression, which is \u2018one of the essential foundations of a democratic society \nand one of the basic conditions for its progress.\u201968  In giving meaning to the language of \nthe Convention the Strasbourg organs have established a number of guiding principles \nwhich permeate the Convention jurisprudence: the protection afforded to the Convention \nrights must be \u2018practical and effective\u2019 not \u2018theoretical and illusory.\u201969  A fair balance \nshould be struck, \u2018between the demands of the general interest of the community and the \nrequirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights.\u201970  The exceptions \nto the qualified rights must be \u2018narrowly interpreted,\u201971 and any restriction imposed on a \n                                                 \n66 Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher (n 41) 329, per Lord Wilberforce. \n67 Brown v Stott (n 23) 707, per Lord Steyn.  For the viewpoint of the Strasbourg Court on the objectives of \nthe Convention see: United Communist Party of Turkey v Turkey (1998) 26 EHRR 121, paras 43-45.   \n68 D Pannick and A Lester Human Rights Law and Practice (Butterworths London 1999) 68-69.   \n69 Artico v Italy (1981) 3 EHRR 1, para 33. \n70 Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v Sweden (1982) 5 EHRR 35, para 69.   \n71 Sunday Times v United Kingdom (n 54) para 65.   \n 18\nprotected right must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  Admittedly, it is \nhighly unlikely that such principles will be determinative of individual cases in the \nabstract, or be of help in defining the precise content of a right or rights, in domestic law, \nbut ensuring a firm grounding in Convention principle will safeguard against the \noverturning of a domestic decision at Strasbourg.  Equally, adopting the Convention \nprinciples as aids to the interpretation of the Strasbourg case-law might well lead to the \ndomestic court giving a more generous protection to the right in question by interpreting \nan exception to the right narrowly where the European Court of Human Rights has \narguably not done so.72 \n In those areas where the Strasbourg organs have traditionally afforded a wide \nmargin of appreciation, recourse to the principles underlying the Convention becomes of \nincreased importance.  In the areas where the Strasbourg case law affords little or no \ndirect guidance \u2013 either where the primary source of authority exists only in admissibility \ndecisions,73 or where the Court has deferred to the judgment of the national authorities74 \n\u2013 \u2018indirect guidance may be obtained from it, but only by a process of inference; \ntherefore the principles deriving from the Strasbourg jurisprudence should generally be \ncalled upon to underpin and guide this inferential process.\u201975  \n \nII.  ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF AUTHORITY \nDiscussions of judicial attempts to reconcile the \u2018constitutional\u2019 status of the HRA with \nthe limitations on the judicial role have largely focussed on the boundary between \nlegitimate interpretation and illegitimate legislation under section 3(1) HRA.  And in \ntreating \u2018clear and constant\u2019 Strasbourg authority as precedent the domestic courts are \u2013 \non the whole \u2013 safeguarding against accusations of the judge \u2018govern[ing] society on the \n                                                 \n72 As in, for example, Otto-Preminger Institute v Austria (1985) 19 EHRR 34.   \n73 As in, for example, the case-law on public protest, on which see: H Fenwick and G Phillipson \u2018Public \nProtest, the Human Rights Act and Judicial Responses to Political Expression\u2019 [2000] PL 627, 640-641.   \n74 Strasbourg decisions on restrictions on freedom of expression on grounds of morality provide useful \nexamples: Handyside v United Kingdom (n 24); M\u00fcller v Switzerland (1991) 13 EHRR 212.   \n75 Fenwick and Phillipson (n 56) 564.   \n 19\nbasis of his own philosophy, his own biases, or his own worldview.\u201976  But in placing \nreliance on sources of authority and legal principle beyond the Strasbourg jurisprudence, \ndomestic courts are beginning to address some of the limitations of the Convention case-\nlaw, and are giving a \u2018generous and purposive\u2019 interpretation to the section 2(1) of the \nHRA itself.   \nA.  Sources of comparative law \nThe text of section 2(1) allows scope for \u2013 or at least does not expressly prohibit \u2013 the \nconsideration of jurisprudence from other jurisdictions.  This may, as Klug has noted, be \nparticularly appropriate where there is \u2018little or no steer from the Strasbourg organs.\u201977  \nThat domestic courts have been willing to examine comparative jurisprudence has been \nevident from some of the earliest decisions taken under the HRA.  In Brown v Stott78 \u2013 a \nchallenge to the admissibility of evidence obtained under section 172 of the Road Traffic \nAct 1988 on the basis that it compelled disclosure of certain information under threat of \ncriminal sanctions in breach of Article 6 \u2013 Lords Bingham and Hope examined \njurisprudence under the Canadian Charter on the right against self-incrimination.  In that \ncase Lord Hope, however, urged caution in the use of comparative standards and in so \ndoing drew attention to the need to maintain a common approach noting that \u2018care needs \nto be taken in the context of the European Convention to ensure that the analysis by the \nCanadian courts proceeds upon the same principles as those which have been developed \nby the European Commission and the European Court\u201979 \u2013 hinting at the potential \nillegitimacy of a judicial decision which departed from those principles.  Lord Hope\u2019s \nconcerns were echoed by Lord Bingham in Attorney-General\u2019s Reference, No 4 of 2002, \n                                                 \n76 Justice Antonin Scalia \u2018The Bill of Rights: Confirmation of Extent Freedoms or Invitation to Judicial \nCreation?\u2019 in G Huscroft and P Rishworth (eds) Litigating Rights: Perspectives from Domestic and \nInternational Law (Hart Publishing Oxford 2002) 23.  \n77 F Klug \u2018The Human Rights Act 1998, Pepper v Hart and All That\u2019 [1999] PL 246, 251.  For a \nparticularly useful examination of the use of comparative jurisprudence in human rights adjudication see C \nMcCrudden \u2018A Common Law of Human Rights?: Transnational Judicial Conversations on Constitutional \nRights\u2019 (2000) 20(4) OJLS 499.   \n78 Brown v Stott (n 23).   \n79 ibid., 724.   \n 20\nwith the requirement that domestic courts retain a firm grounding in the Convention \njurisprudence made explicit: \u2018the United Kingdom Courts must take their lead from \nStrasbourg.\u201980  \n But what is interesting about the domestic courts\u2019 reference to comparative \njurisprudence is that it has not been restricted to those circumstances in which there is \nlittle or no \u2018steer\u2019 from the Strasbourg organs.  In Brown v Stott for example, reference to \nthe Canadian jurisprudence was not made as a consequence of the paucity of Strasbourg \njurisprudence on self-incrimination,81 but to offer a perspective from a comparable court \nin the national setting, as opposed to that of an international court of review.  In one sense \ntherefore, the English courts can be seen to be taking an activist approach: in placing \nincreased reliance on comparative jurisprudence in human rights adjudication, even \nwhere their primary source, the Convention case-law, has a wealth of \u2018relevant\u2019 \njurisprudence available.82  In one sphere in particular, that of the protection of personal \nprivacy under the common law doctrine of breach of confidence, the importation of a \nlegal test from Australian law appeared \u2013 at least until the House of Lords decision in \nCampbell83 \u2013 \u2018to have had far more influence on the development of confidence as a \nprivacy remedy than any principles derived from Article 8.\u201984  \nMore specifically, the possibility of reliance on comparative jurisprudence has \nbeen recognised as a legitimate way of compensating for the inadequacies of the \nStrasbourg authorities: \n \n                                                 \n80 Attorney-General\u2019s Reference, No 4 of 2002 [2004] UKHL 43, para 33.  See also Douglas v Hello! Ltd \n[2001] QB 967, 989, per Brooke LJ.   \n81 Funke v France (1993) 16 EHRR 297, para 44; Murray v United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 29, paras \n44-45; Saunders v United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 313, paras 67-76.   \n82 Although in those circumstances it should not simply be assumed that the domestic judge will \u2018take \naccount\u2019 of decisions from other jurisdictions: R (on the application of the National Union of Journalists v \nCentral Arbitration Committee [2004] EWHC 2612, para 49, per Hodge J: \u2018... it seems to me that \u2026 the \nCanadian jurisprudence adds little to the interpretation in this case.\u2019   \n83 Campbell v MGN Ltd  [2004] 2 AC 457.  \n84 G Phillipson \u2018Transforming Breach of Confidence? Towards a Common Law Right of Privacy under the \nHuman Rights Act\u2019 (2003) 65 MLR 726, 731.   \n 21\nThe elastic and elusive nature Strasbourg doctrine of the \u2018margin of appreciation\u2019 \nis applied by the European Court on the basis of ad hoc pragmatic judgments, \nsometimes lacking in clear and consistent principles.  The developing principles \ncontained in the constitutional case law of courts in other common law countries \u2013 \nsuch as the Constitutional Court of South Africa, the Supreme Courts of the \nUnited States, Canada and India, the High Court of Australia, and the Court of \nAppeal of New Zealand \u2013 are likely to be at least as persuasive as the Strasbourg \ncase law.  Indeed in Reyes v The Queen,85 Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed \nthat \u2018Decided cases around the world have given valuable guidance on the proper \napproach to the courts to the task of constitutional interpretation.\u201986 \n \nComparative jurisprudence from those countries outside the Council of Europe is likely \nto offer little in terms of the strict question of judging the compatibility of a statutory \nprovision with the Convention rights themselves; similarly it is unlikely to point to the \ndirection in which the common law should be developed to ensure or maintain \ncompatibility with the Convention rights.87   \nComparative jurisprudence is likely to come most usefully into play \u2013 as in the \ndecision in Brown v Stott \u2013 in the assessment of how other jurisdictions have dealt with \nsimilar limitations on rights or clashes between the individual and public interest.  \nEqually useful for the process of assessing the legitimacy of a restriction in Convention \nterms will be the issue of alternative solutions or approaches adopted in comparable \njurisdictions: the usefulness of this reasoning technique was demonstrated as a part of the \nproportionality inquiry undertaken in R v A, where Lord Hope of Craighead analysed the \napproaches taken by rape-shield provisions in the United States (Michigan, New Jersey \nand California), Australia (New South Wales and Western Australia), Canada and \n                                                 \n85 [2002] 2 WLR 1034, 1045.  \n86 A Lester and L Clapinska \u2018Human Rights and the British Constitution\u2019 in J Jowell and D Oliver (eds) \nThe Changing Constitution (5th ed) (Oxford University Press Oxford 2004) 83.   \n87 An exception to this general point might be if the actual content of the Convention right was unclear.   \n 22\nScotland.88  Similarly in R v Lambert,89 where Lord Steyn set down the \u2018eloquent\u2019 \nexplanation of the presumption of innocence adopted by Sachs J in the South African \nConstitutional Court decision of State v Coetzee,90 before endorsing the reasoning of \nDickson CJC in the Supreme Court of Canada judgment in R v Whyte91 regarding the \nproportionate nature of restrictions on that presumption.   \n \nB.  Fundamental common law rights \nPrior to the implementation of the HRA the domestic case-law on fundamental, or \nconstitutional, common law rights was \u2013 in UK-terms \u2013 a relatively sophisticated \nstatement of positive rights, in comparison to the largely residual state of liberty in the \nUK at that time.92  In the International Transport Roth case, Laws LJ stated: \n \n\u2026 the common law has come to recognise and endorse the notion of \nconstitutional, or fundamental rights.  These are broadly the rights given \nexpression in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and \nFundamental Freedoms, but their recognition in the common law is autonomous \n\u2026 the Human Rights Act 1998 now provides a democratic underpinning to the \n                                                 \n88 R v A (No 2) (n 5), paras 100-102.  This case is also of interest due to the reliance placed in particular on \ntwo decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada \u2013 R v Seaboyer [1991] 2 SCR 577 and R v Darrach (2000) \n191 DLR (4th) 539 \u2013 due to the similarity of the restrictions on admissible evidence in rape trials in place \nunder the Canadian Criminal Code.   \n89 R v Lambert [2002] 2 AC 545. \n90 ibid, para 34 (State v Coetzee [1997] 2 LRC 593).   \n91 ibid, para 35 (R v Whyte (1998) 51 DLR 4th 481).   \n92 As Lord Steyn has noted extra-judicially, the classification of a right as constitutional \u2018is a powerful \nindication that added value is attached to the protection of the right.  It strengthens the normative force of \nsuch rights.  It virtually rules out arguments that such rights can be impliedly repealed by subsequent \nlegislation\u2019 (Lord Steyn \u2018Dynamic Interpretation amidst an orgy of statutes\u2019 [2004] EHRLR 245, 252).  For \ncriticisms of the common law method of rights protection see J Doyle and B Wells \u2018How far can the \ncommon law go towards protecting human rights?\u2019 in Alston (n 61) 17.    \n 23\ncommon law\u2019s acceptance of constitutional rights, and important new procedural \nmeasures for their protection.93   \n \nAnd although the HRA has brought certain of the Convention Rights into play in \ndomestic law, as the House of Lords recognised in Anufrijeva, \u2018the Convention is not an \nexhaustive statement of fundamental rights under our system of law.\u201994  In his Third \nAnnual Commonwealth Lecture, Lord Cooke of Thorndon outlined the rights recognised \nby the English common law as \u2018constitutional\u2019; they are: \u2018the right of access to a court; \nthe right of access to legal advice; and the right to communicate confidentially with a \nlegal adviser under the seal of legal professional privilege.\u2019  Further he adds, there exists \na \u2018right of participation in the democratic process, equality of treatment, freedom of \nexpression, religious freedom, \u2026 the right of unimpeded access to the courts \u2026 [and] \nalso the right to a fair trial.\u201995  These rights, Lord Cooke goes on, \u2018exist quite apart from \nthe Human Rights Act\u2019; their existence predates 2 October 2000 when that statute came \ninto force.   \nThe relationship between the rights conferred under the HRA and fundamental \ncommon law rights is something of an ambiguity which is yet to be clarified.  It seems as \nif constitutional rights are not to be simply subsumed into the developing domestic \njurisprudence concerning the \u2018Convention rights\u2019 as defined in section 1(1) of the HRA.  \nThe above dicta of Laws LJ suggests that the HRA has given a sense of democratic \nlegitimacy to the common law of fundamental rights.  And as Sedley LJ has said of the \ndevelopment of the common law in relation to the legal protection of personal privacy, \nthe Convention rights and the common law, \u2018now run in a single channel,\u201996 thereby \nseemingly suggesting that there exists a degree of symbiosis between the two.97  It \n                                                 \n93 International Transport Roth GmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] QB 728, para \n71.   \n94 R (on the application of Anufrijeva) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] 1 AC 604, para \n27.   \n95 Lord Cooke of Thorndon \u2018The Road Ahead for the Common Law\u2019 53 ICLQ 273, 276-277.   \n96 Douglas and others v Hello! (n 80) 998.   \n97 The symbiotic relationship between the common law and a \u2018bill of rights\u2019 has also been noted by the \nChief Justice of Canada, Beverly McLachlin: \u2018\u2026 bills of rights do alter the common law \u2026 the common \n 24\nfollows therefore, that in circumstances in which there is no clear guidance from the \nStrasbourg authorities, then previously existing common law standards could legitimately \nbe relied upon in the development of human rights standards under the HRA \u2013 provided \nthat they too are based on the same principles which underpin the Convention and its \ncase-law.  Indeed, even with clear guidance from the Strasbourg authority, domestic case-\nlaw concerning a common law right should not be disregarded as it may already afford a \ngreater protection than that provided by the Strasbourg case-law.  In such circumstances, \neven in the face of \u2018clear and constant\u2019 Strasbourg jurisprudence, it is at least arguable \nthat greater weight be given to the existing right in domestic law.  \nThe use of the Convention rights to bolster protections afforded by the common \nlaw has been one of the most salient developments under the HRA thus far \u2013 the most \nobvious example perhaps being the increased protection afforded to personal information \nunder the doctrine of breach of confidence culminating in the striking decision in \nCampbell.98  In that case, Lord Nicholls noted that the post-HRA development of the \ndoctrine of confidence was such that the action could now more accurately be termed \n\u2018misuse of private information\u2019, reflecting the fact that the law no longer required an \nexisting confidential relationship nor was it limited to protecting information which \nmight strictly be called \u2018confidential.\u201999  That is not, however, to say that existing \ncommon law rights have been subsumed into the \u2018Convention rights\u2019 afforded protection \nunder the HRA.  The two traditions can be seen to be operating in tandem.  The decision \nof the House of Lords in ex parte Daly100 for example owes more to the domestic \njurisprudence on access to a court and legal professional privilege101 than to any \n                                                                                                                                                 \nlaw modifies a bill of rights, even an entrenched bill of rights.  The result is a hybrid system, incorporating \naspects of the rights tradition into the common law and vice versa\u2019 (B McLachlin \u2018Bills of Rights in \nCommon Law Countries\u2019 (2002) ICLQ 197, 197.  \n98 Campbell v MGN Ltd (n 83); on which see J Morgan \u2018Privacy in the House of Lords, again\u2019 (2004) 120 \nLQR 563.  \n99 ibid., para 14.   \n100 R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Daly [2001] 2 AC 532.   \n101 Raymond v Honey [1983] 1 AC 1; R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Anderson \n[1984] QB 778; R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Leech [1994] QB 198.   \n 25\nConvention jurisprudence on prisoner\u2019s rights.102  The reason given by Lord Cooke of \nThorndon in Daly was that, \u2018some rights are inherent and fundamental to democratic \ncivilised society.  Conventions, constitutions, bills of rights and the like respond by \nrecognising rather than creating them.\u2019103  \nFurther, there is the distinct possibility that existing common law rights may be \nrelied upon to remedy deficiencies or lacunae in the Strasbourg jurisprudence104 \u2013 Lord \nSteyn has speculated that the domestic courts\u2019 treatment of Article 14 might be \nsupplemented by the existing common law right of equality:  \n \nThe anti-discrimination provision in Article 14 of the Convention is parasitic \ninasmuch as it serves only to protect specific Convention rights.  There is no \ngeneral or free-standing prohibition on discrimination.  This is a relatively weak \nprotection.  On the other hand, the constitutional principle of equality developed \ndomestically by our courts is stronger.  In our system the law and government \nmust accord to every individual equal concern and respect for their welfare and \ndignity.  Everyone is entitled to equal protection of the law, which must be \napplied without fear or favour.  Law\u2019s necessary distinctions must be justified but \nmust never be made on grounds of race, colour, belief, gender or other irrational \nground \u2026 The organic development of constitutional rights is therefore a \ncomplementary and parallel process to the application of the Human Rights \nAct.105   \n \n                                                 \n102 Of which Campbell v United Kingdom (1992) 15 EHRR 137 is the only example cited by the House of \nLords \u2013 although reference is made to Smith and Grady v United Kingdom (1999) 29 EHRR 493 and Lustig \nPrean v United Kingdom (1999) 29 EHRR 548 to \u2018illuminate the distinctions between \u201ctraditional\u201d \u2026 \nstandards of judicial review and higher standards under the European Convention or the common law of \nhuman rights\u2019 (para 32, per Lord Cooke).   \n103 Daly (n 100) para 30.     \n104 For an example of the common law of Canada being used to remedy what would have been a \u2018lacuna \ncreated by [the] strict application of the Charter\u2019 see: R v Seaboyer [1991] 2 SCR 577 (described in \nMcLachlin (n 97) 202).   \n105 Steyn (n 39) 551-552.   \n 26\nAnd the application of existing common law principles to HRA adjudication is not \nconfined to defining or applying the content of specific rights, the rule that fundamental \nrights cannot be legitimately restricted through \u2018general or ambiguous words\u2019 is one of \ngeneral application: it applies to \u2018fundamental rights beyond the four corners of the \nConvention.\u2019106   \nAssuming that this dicta points to common law, or fundamental, rights continuing \nto existing independently of the Convention rights under the HRA, it may also suggest a \ndegree of upward influence \u2013 of the Convention rights themselves being influenced at the \nStrasbourg level by developments in domestic common law.  It can be said that domestic \ncase-law can aid the development of Convention rights at the Strasbourg level: decisions \nof State\u2019s national courts form a large part of the evidence on which the Strasbourg \ngauges the \u2018present day conditions\u2019 in the light of which the Convention is to be \ninterpreted.   \n \nC.  Separation of powers \nInvoking constitutional principle in judicial reasoning is \u2013 similarly to reliance on \ncomparative authority \u2013 by no means a phenomena brought about by the advent of the \nHRA.  Historically courts have relied upon the doctrine of separation of powers in cases \nconcerning local authority spending,107 the correct construction of the Trade Union and \nLabour Relations Act 1974,108 and a ministerial decision not to publish a report by the \nSerious Fraud Office109 among others.  The rule of law has played a similarly important \nrole in determining cases \u2013 perhaps most famously in Entick v Carrington110 \u2013 for \ninstance in adjudication involving contempt of court and the disclosure of journalists\u2019 \nsources111 and the enforcement of judgments made outside this jurisdiction.112  The HRA \n                                                 \n106 Anufrijeva (n 94) para 27, per Lord Steyn.   \n107 R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Nottinghamshire County Council [1986] AC 240, \n250, per Lord Scarman.   \n108 Dupont Steel v Sirs [1980] 1 WLR 142.   \n109 R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, ex parte Lonrho [1989] 1 WLR 525.   \n110 (1765) 19 St Tr 1030.   \n111 X v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] AC 1, 48, per Lord Bridge.   \n 27\nmay however, represent an important step towards the further \u2018constitutionalisation\u2019 of \npublic law adjudication in the UK by enhancing the substantive content of these \nconstitutional principles as elements of a domestic human rights jurisprudence.   \nHinting at a more activist stance to the Strasbourg jurisprudence under section \n2(1), domestic courts have suggested that they may not follow Strasbourg decisions in \ncases in which the European Court of Human Rights has seriously misunderstood the \nrelevant UK law113 or has not \u2018receive[d] all the help which was needed to form a \nconclusion.\u2019114  A further indication of a situation where a United Kingdom court might \nlegitimately depart from the \u2018clear and constant\u2019115 jurisprudence of the European Court \nwas given by Lord Hoffmann in Alconbury:  \n \nThe House [of Lords] is not bound by the decisions of the European Court and, if \nI thought that \u2026 they compelled a conclusion fundamentally at odds with the \ndistribution of powers under the British constitution, I would have considerable \ndoubt as to whether they should be followed.116   \n \nLord Hoffmann\u2019s dicta hints at a certain normative force to the principles on which the \nUK constitution is based which might justify a departure from the Strasbourg authorities.  \nSignificantly, it can also be read as suggesting that the section 2(1) obligation might also \nrequire an evaluation of the suitability of the relevant Strasbourg authority to be applied \nor relied on in the domestic context.  Similarly to the democratic endorsement of the \n                                                                                                                                                 \n112 Black Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG [1975] AC 591, 638, per \nLord Diplock.   \n113 R v Lyons (No  3) [2003] 1 AC 976, para 46: \u2018If, for example, an English court considers that the ECtHR \nhas misunderstood or been misinformed about some aspect of English law, it may wish to give a judgment \nwhich invites the ECtHR to reconsider the question\u2019 (per Lord Hoffmann).  An example of such a \nmisunderstanding can be seen in Osman v United Kingdom (2000) 29 EHRR 245; see R Clayton \n\u2018Developing Principles for Human Rights\u2019 (2002) EHRLR 175, 178; Lord Hoffmann \u2018Human Rights and \nthe House of Lords\u2019 (1999) 62(2) MLR 159, 162-164.     \n114 R v Spear and Others [2003] 1 AC 734, para 12, per Lord Bingham.   \n115 See n 58 above and eg Anderson (n 9) para 18, per Lord Bingham.   \n116 Alconbury (n 58) para 76.   \n 28\ncommon law\u2019s fundamental rights jurisprudence provided by the HRA, the Act may \nequally be seen as providing the impetus for a forceful restatement of the separation of \npowers doctrine in UK law.   \nIn spite of the fact that the European Court of Human Rights has consistently \nmaintained that the Convention itself does not demand adherence to any \u2018theoretical \nconstitutional concepts,\u2019117 the notion of the separation of powers has attained a certain \nprominence in the case-law of the Strasbourg Court: the \u2018growing importance\u2019 of the \ndoctrine was noted in Stafford v United Kingdom,118 while in Benjamin and Wilson v \nUnited Kingdom the principle of separation of powers was referred to as \n\u2018fundamental.\u2019119  This trend is arguably also apparent in post-HRA domestic case-law, \nperhaps most emphatically in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte \nAnderson.120 \nThe European Court of Human Rights has also consistently stressed that the \ndoctrine of separation of powers will not be determinative of a breach in and of itself: in \neach case the specific facts must be taken into consideration.121  In those cases where the \nseparation of powers has been in play regarding fair trial rights in Article 6(1) \u2013 either \nthrough links between the judicial and legislative or judicial and executive arms \u2013 in \nobjective terms the court or tribunal in question must be judged to be impartial and \n\u2018independent of the executive and also of the parties.\u2019122  Further evidence of the growing \nimportance of the doctrine can be found in the fact that the European Court of Human \nRights has also recognised that the separation of judicial and legislative powers may be \n                                                 \n117 McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) 30 EHRR 289, para 51.   \n118 Stafford v United Kingdom (n 22) para 78.   \n119 Benjamin and Wilson v United Kingdom (2003) 36 EHRR 1, para 36.   \n120 Anderson (n 9) where Lord Bingham observed that the European Court of Human Rights had been \ncorrect to \u2018describe the complete functional separation of the judiciary from the executive as \u201cfundamental\u201d \nsince the rule of law depends on it\u2019 (882), with Lord Hutton adding that such a separation is \u2018an essential \npart of a democracy\u2019 (899).    \n121 Kleyn v Netherlands (2004) 38 EHRR 14, para 193.   \n122 Ringeisen v Austria (1979-80) 1 EHRR 455, para 95.   \n 29\nregarded as a \u2018legitimate aim\u2019 to be pursued by national authorities.123  A recent \nindication of the increased stature attained by the separation of powers doctrine in the \njurisprudence of the Strasbourg authorities can be found in the (dissenting) judgment of \nJudge Borrego Borrego in Pabla KY v Finland where \u2013 without explicit regard to the \nparticular factual circumstances of the case \u2013 he asserted that the doctrine is an \u2018essential \ncomponent of a state based on the rule of law.\u2019124  Similarly, in the case of Kleyn v \nNetherlands, the dissenting judgment of Judge Tsatsa-Nikolovska reads as follows:  \n \n\u2026 the exercise of both advisory and judicial functions by the same persons is, as a \nmatter of principle, incompatible with the requirements of Art.6 regardless of the \nquestion how remote or close the connection is between these functions.  A strict \nand visible separation between the legislative and executive authorities on the one \nhand and the judicial authorities of the state on the other is indispensable for \nsecuring the independence and impartiality of judges and thus the confidence of  \nthe general public in its judicial system.  Compromise in this area cannot but \nundermine this confidence.125  \n \nWhether these dissenting voices can be taken as a precursor of future Strasbourg \njurisprudence remains to be seen; although perhaps ironically their most ringing \nendorsement, in domestic terms, can be found in the Government\u2019s proposals of June \n2003 to establish a Supreme Court independent of the House of Lords and to abolish, \nlatterly reform, the office of Lord Chancellor.  What can be said with some certainty is \nthat the domestic judiciary have taken heed of the emphasis increasingly being placed on \nthe separation of powers doctrine by the European Court of Human Rights.  In R v \n                                                 \n123 A v United Kingdom (2003) 36 EHRR 51, para 77, where, in a case concerning parliamentary immunity, \nthe court noted that: \u2018the Parliamentary immunity enjoyed by the MP in the present case pursued the \nlegitimate aims of protecting free speech in Parliament and maintaining the separation of powers between \nthe legislature and the judiciary\u2019.   \n124 Dissenting opinion of Judge Borrego Borrego in Pabla KY v Finland, 22 June 2004 (available at: \nwww.echr.coe.int)  \n125 Kleyn v Netherlands (n 121) (Judge Tsatsa-Nikolovska\u2019s dissenting opinion was joined by Judges \nStr\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1 and Ugrekhelidze) (emphasis added).   \n 30\nSecretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Anderson, Lord Bingham observed \nthat the Strasbourg court had been correct to \u2018describe the complete functional separation \nof the judiciary from the executive as \u201cfundamental\u201d since the rule of law depends on \nit,\u2019126 Lord Hutton adding that such a separation is an \u2018essential part of a democracy.\u2019127  \nOne commentator has speculated that the Anderson judgment might \u2018be a starting point \nfor building a separation of powers jurisprudence which, although rooted in Article 6, \nextends beyond the existing objective and subjective tests for independence and \nimpartiality.\u2019128   \nAnd so in spite of the fact that the European Court of Human Rights has held that \nthe principle of separation of powers will not be \u2018decisive in the abstract\u2019, there is a \ngrowing body of opinion which suggests that in determining a human rights issue, more \nweight can be attached to the principle by the domestic judiciary than has hitherto been \npossible \u2013 at least in terms of the functional separation of judicial power from those held \nby the executive and legislature, something which a number of senior judges in the \nUnited Kingdom regard as a \u2018cardinal feature of a modern, liberal democratic state \ngoverned by the rule of law.\u2019129  In this sphere at least we may be seeing the beginnings \nof the movement away from the separation of powers as a benign principle of the UK \nconstitutional arrangements into a principle of domestic human rights law.   \n  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nWhile it may be accepted that \u2018law-making \u2013 within certain limits \u2013 is an inevitable and \nlegitimate element of the judge\u2019s role,\u2019130 the extent of those limits vis-\u00e0-vis the HRA are \nstill being probed by the courts, most obviously in the jurisprudence on the meaning of \n\u2018possible\u2019 in section 3(1).  And while the result achieved by a judgment may be seen as \n                                                 \n126 Anderson (n 9) 882.   \n127 ibid., 899.   \n128 M Amos \u2018R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Anderson \u2013 Ending the Home \nSecretary\u2019s Sentencing Role\u2019 (2004) 67(1) MLR 108, 123.   \n129 Response of the Law Lords to the Government\u2019s consultation paper, A Supreme Court for the United \nKingdom, available at: www.parliament.uk\/judicial_work\/   \n130 Irvine (n 49) 12.   \n 31\ncorrect, without the support of relevant authority, a decision will be open to accusations \nof unwarranted activism.  An example of a decision which has been praised for its \npurposive application of the HRA \u2013 in remedying an iniquity in the law by extending the \nprotection afforded to heterosexual couples under the Rent Act 1977 to those in same-sex \nrelationships \u2013 can be found in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ghaidan v Godin-\nMendoza.131  Yet this decision has been simultaneously criticised for lacking any \nprincipled grounding in the Strasbourg case-law.132   \nWhile the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Mendoza was upheld by a majority of the \nHouse of Lords,133 the episode illustrates that there remains a fine line between a \nconstitutionally legitimate development in human rights law, and one which may \narguably exceed the boundaries of the judicial role under the HRA.  Some explanation for \nthis may be found in the fact that doubts remain over the actual constitutional function of \nthe HRA itself.  Is the Act simply a mechanism which governs the interpretation of \nstatute law and development of the common law by reference to the (fluid) standards of \nan international treaty?  Or does it provide the courts with a mandate to develop and \nexpand on those standards found in the European Convention in the domestic context?  \nThe argument here has favoured the latter, but there appears to be no clear judicial \nconsensus on the issue at this point.  The judgment of Lord Hoffmann in Re McKerr \u2013 a \ncase concerning the procedural rights adjunctive to Article 2 ECHR and the question of \ntheir existence at common law prior to the advent of the HRA \u2013 is revealing in terms of \nhis assessment of the position of the Convention rights in domestic law.  In his speech, \nLord Hoffmann said of the rights under the HRA:  \n \n\u2026 [a]lthough people sometimes speak of the Convention having been \nincorporated into domestic law, that is a misleading metaphor.

But they are domestic rights, not international rights.  Their \nsource is the statute, not the Convention \u2026 their meaning and application is a \nmatter for domestic courts, not the court in Strasbourg.134   \n \nThis statement is remarkable in that it seems to mark a backward step from the House of \nLords\u2019 concerns that any decision on a Convention right which departed from \u2018clear and \nconstant\u2019 Strasbourg jurisprudence ran the risk of being overturned by the European \nCourt of Human Rights.135  It is also arguably inconsistent with, or at least strongly in \ntension with, the requirement to \u2018take into account\u2019 the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg \norgans under section 2(1).  Moreover, it could be suggested that this approach to the \nHRA comes close to treating the Act as a UK Bill of Rights as it has the potential to \nseparate the content of domestic human rights law almost completely from the \nConvention and its jurisprudence.  In asserting that the \u2018meaning and application\u2019 of the \nrights under the HRA is a \u2018matter for domestic courts\u2019 \u2013 and explicitly denying this \nfunction to Strasbourg \u2013 Lord Hoffman could be seen as laying claim to a more creativist \nrole for domestic courts in rights litigation.  Diverging the meaning of the rights under the \nHRA completely from the Convention and its jurisprudence would, under the auspices of \nan Act designed to \u2018give further effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights,\u2019 undoubtedly come into conflict with the \nscheme of the HRA.136  But in his recognition that the rights conferred by the HRA are \n\u2018domestic rights, not international rights\u2019, Lord Hoffmann may tacitly acknowledge that \nthe interpretation of those rights in the domestic context is a different exercise from that \nperformed by the European Court of Human Rights, and one for which it is not sufficient \nto simply \u2018have regard\u2019 to the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  While the Convention and its \njurisprudence may provide the basis by which questions of compatibility relating to the \n                                                 \n134 In Re McKerr [2004] UKHL 12, para 65.   \n135 Alconbury (n 58) para 26, per Lord Slynn.   \n136 Most obviously in terms of judging the \u2018compatibility\u2019 of an act or omission with the Convention rights \nunder s 3(1) or s 6(1) HRA and in the potential making a \u2018declaration of incompatibility\u2019 under s 4(2).   \n 33\n 34\nConvention rights may be judged, if those rights are to be \u2018further realised\u2019 in domestic \nlaw, the judiciary may also have to look elsewhere for guidance. \n"}
