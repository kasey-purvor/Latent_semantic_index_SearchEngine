Correspondences be-\ntween the nonlinear interaction terms of the model (1) and the\nobserved frequencies are shown by arrows.Heart rate variability (HRV) is an important dynamical\nphenomenon in physiology. Altered HRV is associated\nwith cardiovascular diseases and increased mortality [1],\nand its parameters are starting to be used for diagnostic\ntests. However, signals from the human cardiovascular\nsystem (CVS), being derived from a living organism, arise\nthrough the interaction of many dynamical degrees of\nfreedom and processes with different time scales [2].\nThus HRV is attributable to the mutual interaction of a\nlarge number of oscillatory processes. Among them, the\neffect of respiration on heart rate has been the most in-\ntensively studied and a number of physiological mecha-\nnisms have been proposed [3], including, e.g., modulation\nof the cardiac filling pressure during respiratory move-\nments [4] and baroreceptor feedback control [5].\nAn important feature of these processes is that they are\nnonlinear, time-varying, and subject to fluctuations [6\u20138].\nFor such systems, deterministic techniques fail to yield\naccurate parameter estimates [9]. Additionally, models of\nthe cardiovascular interactions are not usually known ex-\nactly from first principles and one is faced with a rather\nbroad range of possible parametric models to consider\n[5,10]. Inverse approaches, in which dynamical properties\nare analyzed from measured data, have recently been\nconsidered. A variety of numerical techniques have been\nintroduced to analyze cardiorespiratory interactions using,\ne.g., linear approximations [11], estimations of either the\nstrength of some of the nonlinear terms [12], the occur-\nrence of cardiorespiratory synchronization [13], or the\ndirectionality of coupling [14]. Hitherto, modeling ap-\nproaches have not been used interactively in conjunction\nwith time-series analysis methods. Rather, the latter have\neach focused on a particular dynamical property, e.g.,\nsynchronization, or nonlinearities, or directionality.\nIn this Letter we introduce an approach to the problem\nthat combines mathematical modeling of system dynamics\nand extraction of model parameters directly from measured\ntime series. In this way we estimate simultaneously the\nstrength, directionality of coupling, and noise intensity in05=94(9)=098101(4)$23.00 09810the cardiorespiratory interaction. The technique recon-\nstructs the nonlinear system dynamics in the presence of\nfluctuations. In addition, the method provides optimal\ncompensation of dynamical noise-induced errors for con-\ntinuous systems while avoiding extensive numerical opti-\nmization. We demonstrate the approach by using a\nunivariate blood pressure (BP) signal for reconstruction\nof a nonlinear stochastic model of the cardiorespiratory\ninteraction. The results are verified by analysis of data\nsynthesized from the inferred model.\nThe problems faced in the analysis of CVS variability\nare common, not only to all living systems, but also to all\ncomplex systems subject to fluctuations, e.g., molecular\nmotors [15] or coupled matter-radiation systems in astro-\nphysics [16]. Yet there are no general methods for the\ndynamical inference of stochastic nonlinear systems.\nThus the technique introduced in this Letter will be of\nwide applicability.\nWe analyze central venous blood pressure data, record\n24 of the MGH\/MF Waveform Database available at\nwww.physionet.org. Its spectrum, shown in Fig. 1(a), ex-\nhibits two basic frequencies corresponding to respiratory,\nfr \u0001 0:2 Hz, and cardiac, fc \u0001 1:7 Hz, oscillations; the\nhigher frequency peaks are the second, third, and fourth1-1 \uf6d9 2005 The American Physical Society\nPRL 94, 098101 (2005) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 MARCH 2005\nharmonics of the cardiac oscillation. We note that the\nrelative intensity and position of these peaks vary from\nsubject to subject, with the average frequencies for healthy\nsubjects at rest being around 0.2 and 1.1 Hz for respiration\nand heart rate, respectively.\nWe must bear in mind that CVS power spectra also\ncontain lower frequency components [1,17]. In practice,\nparametric modeling is usually restricted to a specific part\nof the power spectrum. Because our interest here centers on\nthe cardiorespiratory interaction, we select for study the\nfrequency range that includes the main harmonics of car-\ndiac and respiratory oscillations fc and fr and their com-\nbinational frequencies as shown in Fig. 1(b). In addition,\nwe assume that the two higher basic frequency components\nobserved in all CVS signals [8,18] can be separated. Hence\nthe blood pressure signal can be approximated as a sum of\nthe cardiac and respiratory oscillatory components s\u0002t\u0003 \u0004\nsc\u0002t\u0003 \u0005 sr\u0002t\u0003. Accordingly, we use a combination of zero-\nphase forward and reverse digital filtering based on09810Butterworth filters to decompose [19] it into two-\ndimensional time series fs\u0002tk\u0003 \u0004 \u0007sc\u0002tk\u0003; sr\u0002tk\u0003\b; tk \u0004\nkh; k \u0004 0:Kg representing the cardiac and respiratory os-\ncillatory contributions, respectively.

Details, and a comparison with the\nresults of earlier research, are given elsewhere [20]. Here\nwe describe briefly the main steps in applying the method\nto infer cardiorespiratory interactions. First, one defines the\nso-called likelihood function \u2018\u0002yjM\u0003: the probability den-\nsity to observe the dynamical variables y\u0002t\u0003 under the\ncondition that the underlying dynamical model (4) has a\ngiven set of parameters M. We suggest that, for a uniform\nsampling scheme and a sufficiently small time step h, one\ncan use results from [21] to write the logarithm of the\nlikelihood function as\n\n 2\nK\nlog\u2018\u0002yjM\u0003 \u0004 lndetD^\u0005 h\nK\nXK\n1\nk\u00040\n\u0007v\u0002yk\u0003c\n\u0005 \u0002 _yk \n U^kc\u0003TD^\n1\u0002 _yk \n U^kc\u0003\b\n\u0005 N ln\u00022\u001dh\u0003: (6)\nHere U^k \u000e U^\u0002yk\u0003, _yk \u000e h\n1\u0002yk\u00051 \n yk\u0003, and the vector\nv\u0002x\u0003 has components\nv m\u0002x\u0003 \u0004\nXN\nn\u00041\n@Unm\u0002x\u0003\n@xn\n; m \u0004 1:M:\nNote that the form of (6) differs from the cost function in\nthe method of least-squares: the term involving v provides\noptimal compensation of noise-induced errors [20]. In the\nnext step, one has to summarize a priori expert knowledge\nabout the model parameters in the so-called prior proba-\nbility density function (PDF), ppr\u0002M\u0003. We assume ppr\u0002M\u0003\nto be Gaussian with respect to the elements of c and\nuniform with respect to the elements of D^.\nFinally, one can use the measured time series y to\nimprove the a priori estimation of the model parameters.1-2\n101\nS\n(a) xcxr x2\nc\nx\nr\nPRL 94, 098101 (2005) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 MARCH 2005\nThe improved knowledge is summarized in the posterior\nconditional PDF ppost\u0002Mjy\u0003, which is related to the prior\nPDF via Bayes\u2019 theorem\nppost\u0002Mjy\u0003 \u0004\n\u2018\u0002yjM\u0003ppr\u0002M\u0003R\n\u2018\u0002yjM\u0003ppr\u0002M\u0003dM : (7)\nFor a sufficiently large number of observations, ppost is\nsharply peaked at a certain most probable model M \u0004\nM\u000f, providing a solution to the inference problem.

There is clearly a close resemblance between\nspectral peaks at the basic and combinational frequencies,\nnfc \u0005mfr. A similarly close resemblance is found for\nrespiratory oscillations, sr\u0002t\u0003 and xr\u0002t\u0003, respectively.\nThe frequency content can be reproduced from a uni-\nvariate signal s\u0002t\u0003 because for fr \u0011 fc it can be written\nin the form: s\u0002t\u0003 \u0001 sr\u0002t\u0003 \u0005 Ac\u0002t\u0003 cos\u0007fct\u0005 #c\u0002t\u0003\b \u0005 . . . ,\nwhere Ac\u0002t\u0003; #c\u0002t\u0003 are slow amplitude and phase and the\nomitted terms oscillate at multiples of fc. Fast-oscillating\nterms in this expansion correspond to a cardiac signal sc\u0002t\u0003\nand this ensures the validity of the signal decomposition\ns\u0002t\u0003 \u0004 sr\u0002t\u0003 \u0005 sc\u0002t\u0003, with components corresponding to\nweakly coupled nonlinear oscillators.\nTo validate these results we consider a synthesized\nsignal x\u0002t\u0003 \u0004 xr\u0002t\u0003 \u0005 xc\u0002t\u0003 where xr\u0002t\u0003, xc\u0002t\u0003 are obtained\nusing numerical simulations of the model (1) with parame-\nters taken from the inference. Repetition of the full infer-\nence procedure, using the synthesized univariate signal x\u0002t\u0003\nas a time-series data input s\u0002t\u0003, gives us the cardiac oscil-\nlator parameters \u001520 \u0004 6:32, \u001521 \u0004 0:49, \u001522 \u0004 6:03, and\nD22 \u0004 3:44. These differ from the values in the first row of\nTable I, but provide a correct estimation of the order of\nmagnitude of the absolute values of the measured parame-\nters. The main source of error here is the fact that we have\nto reconstruct the state of multidimensional system using\nthe univariate signal.\nIf the state of the system was known, the accuracy of\ninference could be arbitrarily high [20]. We illustrate this\npoint by using the synthesized time series fxr\u0002t\u0003; xc\u0002t\u0003;\nyr\u0002t\u0003; yc\u0002t\u0003g as bivariate data for two coupled oscillators\nto infer parameters of the model (1).

Estima-\ntion of the noise intensity now has a relative error <4%.\nAccuracy of the estimation can be further improved by\nincreasing the total observation time. The decomposition\nproblem could, of course, be eliminated by using bivariate\ncardiovascular data, which are now commonly available.\nThe relative magnitudes of the parameters obtained,\nj\u0015ij> j\u000fij, indicate that respiration influences cardiac\nactivity more strongly than vice versa, consistent with the\nresults of methods specifically developed for detecting the\ncoupling directionality of interacting oscillators [14], and\nwith direct physiological observations. Furthermore, the\npresence of nonzero quadratic terms is consistent with\nrecent results obtained by time-phase bispectral analysis\n[12]. The frequency and amplitude variability of the main\noscillatory components [8] is implicitly captured within the\ncoupling terms and noise. We find that the present model\nclass is able to reproduce, not only the coupling direc-\ntionality, but also to a large extent the 1:7 and 1:8 cardio-\nrespiratory synchronization properties of the measured\ndata, as will be discussed in detail elsewhere.\nIn summary, we have solved a long-standing problem in\nphysiology: inference of a nonlinear model of cardiores-\npiratory interactions in the presence of fluctuations. Our\ntechnique estimates simultaneously the strength and direc-\ntionality of coupling, and the noise intensity in the cardio-\nrespiratory interaction, directly from measured time series.\nIt has also demonstrated stable and reliable inference of a\nbroad class of models with high accuracy [20] and can, in\nprinciple, be applied to any physiological signal. Although\nour technique is only a first step in the development of\npath-integral-based dynamical inference of stochastic non-\nlinear models, it can readily be extended to encompass\nfrequencies below that of respiration, nervous feedback\ncontrol mechanisms, time-delay functions, nonpolynomial\nbasis functions, parametric, and nonwhite noise. Our solu-\ntion is facilitated by an analytic derivation of the likelihood\nfunction that optimally compensates noise-induced errors\nin continuous dynamical systems. It has enabled us to\neffect the first application of nonlinear stochastic inference\nto identify a dynamical model from real data.\nThis work was supported by the NASA CICT IS IDU\nproject (USA), by the Leverhulme Trust and by EPSRC\n(UK), by the MS\u02c7ZS\u02c7 (Slovenia), and by INTAS.[1] A.
