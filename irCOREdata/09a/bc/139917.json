The technique exploits the core-cladding mode coupling of\na tilted fibre Bragg grating (TFBG). The core and cladding modes exhibit different thermal\nsensivities, while the strain sensivities are approximately equal. Monitoring the core-core\nmode coupling resonance and the core-cladding mode coupling resonance of the TFBG\nspectrum allows the separation of the temperature and strain induced wavelength shifts.\nKey words: Temperature, strain, sensor, tilted fibre Bragg grating, FBG, TFBG\nThe discrimination of the temperature and strain responses of fibre Bragg grating, FBG,\nsensors has been a consistent area of research over the past 10 years, with a large number of\narticles describing a wide range of techniques [1]. The majority of the reported approaches\nhave relied on the use of two sensors with different sensivities to temperature and strain.\nThis has been achieved in a number of ways. Appropriate packaging can ensure that one of\nthe sensors is shielded from one of the measurands [2]. FBGs with inherently different\nsensitivities may be used, for example, FBGs with different centre wavelengths [3], FBGs\nwritten in fibres of different composition [4] or with different diameters [5], or FBGs\nfabricated under different conditions [6, 7]. Alternatively, the measurement from an FBG\nmay be combined with that of a different sensing technique, for example, measuring the\nfluorescence lifetime of ions in doped optical fibre [8] or stimulated Brillouin scattering [9].\nSingle FBG approaches have been reported. The use of the measurand induced wavelength\nshifts of the 1st and 2nd harmonics of the reflection from an FBG have been used to separate\nthe temperature and strain responses of a single sensor element [10]. This technique,\nhowever, requires the use of optical sources and spectrometers operating in widely differing\nareas of the optical spectrum. In an extension of the technique used in [5], a single FBG may\nbe written across a splice between fibres of different diameters [11], or between fibres of\ndifferent composition [12]. In a similar vein, techniques based on etching or packaging\nsections of a single FBG have been reported [13]. The different thermal sensitivity of the\northogonally polarised reflections from an FBG fabricated in Hi-Bi fibre has also been\nexploited [14]. The techniques are summarised in Table 1(a). In this paper the use of the\nproperties of a single tilted fibre Bragg grating, TFBG, to facilitate the discrimination of\ntemperature and strain is reported.\nA standard FBG consists of a refractive index modulation in the core of an optical fibre that\nacts to couple the fundamental forward propagating mode to the contra-propagating core\nmode at a wavelength that satisfies the phase matching condition. The spectrum of such a\ndevice consists of a narrow wavelength passband in reflection while the transmission\nspectrum exhibits a notch at the wavelength of the passband. A TFBG consists of a\nrefractive index modulation that is purposely blazed relative to the fibre axis in order to\nenhance coupling between the forward-propagating core mode and the contra-propagating\ncladding modes [Figure 1]. The contra-propagating cladding modes attenuate rapidly and are\ntherefore not observable in reflection but are observed as numerous resonances in the\ntransmission spectrum of the TFBG.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of a TFBG. \uf04c\uf03b grating period, and \uf071\uf03b\uf020blaze angle. Dashed\narrows represent the forward propagating core mode.\nCore\nmode\n\u03b8\nCladding mode\n\u039bB \u039b\nCore\nCladding\nThe spectral response of the TFBG is governed by the phase matching condition (equation\n1):\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf071\n\uf06c\ncos\n\uf04c\uf0d7\uf02b\uf03d cladin\nco\neffni\n(1)\nwhere \uf06ci, ncoeff, ncladi, \uf071\uf02c and \uf04c \uf020are the ith cladding mode resonance wavelength, effective index\nof the core, effective index of the ith cladding mode, blaze angle and grating period\nrespectively for a TFBG.\nThe exact form of the transmission spectrum is highly dependent on the tilt angle employed\n[15]. The cladding mode resonance wavelengths will be sensitive to differential changes in\nthe indices of the cladding and core modes, which have been exploited previously to\ndemonstrate a refractometer [16]. For a small tilt angle, it is possible to produce a well\ndefined single loss band that is blue shifted with respect to the main Bragg feature [17], as\nshown in figure 2.\nIt is known from the work carried out on another core-cladding mode coupler, the long\nperiod grating (LPG), that differences in the sensitivities of the effective indices of the core\nand cladding modes facilitate multi-parameter sensing using a single sensor element [18].\nThe composition and\/or geometry of the fibre can be used to tailor the response of the core-\ncladding mode coupling wavelength to particular measurands.\nThe TFBG spectrum contains a spectral feature corresponding to core-core mode coupling\nand features corresponding to core-cladding mode coupling. The technique presented here\nexploits the differences in the thermal and strain sensitivities of the core-cladding mode and\ncore-core mode coupling resonances to facilitate simultaneous, independent measurement of\nstrain and temperature using a single fibre grating.\nA TFBG of length 5 mm, with blaze angle 1.5\u00ba, was fabricated in a boron-germanium co-\ndoped optical fibre, Fibercore PS1250, with cut off wavelength of 1213 nm, using the near-\nfield interference pattern of a tilted phase-mask. The photosensitivity of the fibre was\nenhanced by pressurizing it in hydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at a pressure of 150 bars at\nroom temperature. The phase mask was illuminated with a UV beam at a wavelength of\n244nm and of average power 40 mW. The TFBG was interrogated by coupling the output\nfrom a super luminescent diode of bandwidth 60 nm into the optical fibre, and monitoring\nthe transmission using a scanning fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer of free spectral range 43\nnm and finesse 900 [19]. The reflection and transmission spectra are shown in figure 2.\n00.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2\n1542 1546 1550 1554 1558 1562 1566 1570 1574 1578\nWavelength (nm)\nR\nef\nle\nct\niv\nity\n(a\n.u\n.)\n(a)\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1542 1546 1550 1554 1558 1562 1566 1570 1574 1578\nWavelength (nm)\nT\nra\nns\nm\nis\nsi\non\n(a\n.u\n.)\n(b)\nFigure 2 (a) reflection and (b) transmission spectra of a TFBG with tilt angle 1.5\u00ba,\nfabricated in hydrogen loaded boron-germanium co-doped optical fibre of cut off\nwavelength 1213 nm.\nOne side of the TFBG was anchored to a fixed block, while the other was attached to a block\nmounted on a translation stage, via which a known extension and thus strain could be\napplied. The TFBG was enclosed within a furnace that allowed the temperature to be\ncontrolled to within 1 K. The strain and temperature induced wavelength shifts of the core-\ncore, Bragg, coupling and of the core-cladding mode coupling are plotted in figure 3. The\nlinear fit to the data sets demonstrates that the system response can be described as linear.\nThe contribution from any cross-sensitivity terms will not be significant over temperature\nranges commonly encountered, for example, in structural monitoring [20, 21]. The responses\nmay therefore be expressed in terms of a matrix, equation 2, the inverse of which would be\nused to determine independently temperature and strain.\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf044\n\uf044\nTKK\nKK\nTcladclad\nTcorecore\nclad\ncore \uf065\n\uf06c\n\uf06c\n\uf065\n\uf065\n,,\n,,\n(2)\nWhere \u0394\u03bbcore and \u0394\u03bbclad are the wavelength shifts of the core-core mode resonance and of the\ncore-cladding mode resonance respectively.

The lines are best fits to data points.\nA common method of assessing the performance of a temperature-strain discrimination\nsystem is via the condition number of the matrix, which provides an indication of the\nsensitivity of the matrix operation to uncertainties in the matrix elements [22, 23]. The errors\nthat influence temperature-strain discrimination arise from the accuracy with which the\nsystem parameters that respond to temperature and strain are measured as well as errors\narising from calculating the components of the sensitivity matrix.\nTable 1 (a) describes some of the sensor systems that are referenced in this paper while the\ncorresponding matrix inversion condition numbers are shown in Table 1 (b). The condition\nnumber of the approach reported in this paper is 39.4. This is comparable to that of the best\nperforming single FBG approach, reported in [13], in which a single FBG was fabricated\nacross a splice formed between two different fibre types, but with one fibre type bonded to a\nsubstrate of large thermal expansion coefficient. The smallest condition number, of 5.5, was\ndetermined for the system employing an FBG and stimulated Brillouin scattering [9], where\nthe Bragg wavelength and Brillouin gain frequency have significantly different temperature\nand strain responses.\nTable 1 (b) also details the strain and temperature errors that were calculated using\nformulations reported in [23]. These errors depend on the wavelength measurement\nprecision and on uncertainties in the determination of the matrix-element. In addition, the\nerrors depend on the values of the applied strain and temperature [23]. Three types of strain\nand temperature errors are reported here; (i) maximum (accumulated) errors, where the\nerrors arise only from the precision of the wavelength measurement, (ii) maximum\n(accumulated) errors where errors arise only from the uncertainties in the matrix-element\nvalues, and (iii) errors due to both the wavelength measurement precision and to the matrix\nelement uncertainty (errors not calculated cumulatively). Errors obtained by taking the\nmodulus of individual terms in the error-formulae are referred to as maximum or cumulative\nerrors as they provide the worst possible error scenario. Non-cumulative errors are those\nobtained by taking into consideration the actual sign of the individual terms in the error-\nformulae and are therefore more representative than the maximum errors. A wavelength\nmeasurement resolution of 1 pm is assumed for all calculations. The temperature and strain\nwere assumed to be 50 oC and 1 000 \uf06d\uf065\uf020to allow the determination of the maximum error\nthat might be experienced in a typical structural monitoring application. The matrix element\nuncertainties used in these calculations were the standard deviations that were reported in\nthe references.\nTable 1(b) shows that the matrix condition number is not sufficient on its own to describe\nthe strain-temperature discrimination performance of a system. It can be seen that small\ncondition numbers do not necessarily correlate with small strain and temperature errors. The\ncondition number therefore only provides a qualitative analysis [23]. The condition number\nis calculated based on maximum errors in a measurement system [24] and for this reason the\nresults of Table 1(b) shows some agreement between this number and the\nmaximum\/cumulative errors. The errors of \u00b11 oC and \u00b111 \uf06d\uf065 obtained from the TFBG\nsensor reported in this paper are comparable to errors of \u00b11 oC and \u00b112 \uf06d\uf065 calculated for a 2\nco-located FBG sensor system [3] (2 different wavelengths). However, the difference\nbetween the condition numbers of the two systems, 39.4 and 129.5 respectively, is\nsignificant.\nTable 1: (a) Sensor systems referenced in this paper.

The technique requires the use of a single FBG,\ntracking features that lie within the same spectral range, and does not require special\nprocessing or packaging of the fibre. The use of a small tilt angle that facilitates efficient\ncoupling to a single cladding mode is beneficial, as its spectrum occupies a considerably\nnarrower range than that occupied by TFBGs with larger tilt angles. Thus it allows\nwavelength division multiplexing to be employed. The main limitation of this approach lies\nin the fact that the system must be operated in transmission, which removes one of the\nbenefits of FBG sensors \u2013 namely single ended operation.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (EPSRC), UK.\nReferences\n[1] Frazao, L A Ferreira, F M Araujo and J L Santos, Applications of fibre optic grating\ntechnology to multi-parameter measurement, Fibre Int.
