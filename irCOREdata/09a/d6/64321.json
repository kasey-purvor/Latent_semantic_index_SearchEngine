Introduction \nThe gold mining centre of Diwalwal (also know as Mt. Diwata), located within the mountainous \neast Mindanao Ridge, is one of the largest artisanal gold mining centres on the island of Mindanao \n(Appleton et al., 1999). The focus of mining activity at Diwalwal lies in the headwaters of a series \nof minor tributaries of the Naboc River, which subsequently joins the north-flowing Agusan River \n(Figure 1).  Environmental monitoring surveys in the 1990\u2019s revealed extensive mercury pollution \nof water and sediment in the Naboc River (Appleton et al., 1999).  .  \nMassive, uncontrolled small-scale mining and mineral processing in the headwaters of the Naboc \nRiver in the late 1980's and early 1990's, involving up to 100,000 people resulted in severe \npollution of the irrigated rice paddy fields in the Lower and Upper Naboc Communal Irrigation \nSystems, located either side of the Naboc River and serving 600 farmers and their families (Figure \n1).  Rice yields declined from 6,000 kg\/ha in the 1980's to 3,000 kg\/ha in the 1990's caused by the \nhigh load of fine suspended silt in the irrigation water. The death of a significant number of water \nbuffalo was tentatively diagnosed as cyanide poisoning and farmers working in the affected paddy \nfields had reported unexplained skin diseases (Appleton, 2000). In response to these reported \nproblems, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) funded studies of (1) \nthe extent and magnitude of mercury pollution in the Naboc River and neighbouring agricultural \nareas (Appleton, 2000); (2) the potential risk to human health from consumption of rice cultivated \nin rice paddy fields irrigated by mercury-contaminated mine waste water (Weeks, 2000); and (3) an \n  3\nevaluation of the influence of mercury on the health of people living in the Diwalwal mining centre \nand the villages of Naboc, Tubo-Tubo, Babag and Mamonga (Figure 1; B\u00f6se-O\u2019Reilly et al., 2000, \nDrasch et al., 2001). The objective of this paper is to provide a link between earlier regional studies \n(Appleton et al., 1999) and the detailed health studies (Drasch et al., 2001), which showed that 38% \nof the local inhabitants were classified as Hg intoxicated. Because consumption of contaminated \nrice and fish is the primary route of potential exposure to heavy metals, this paper concentrates on \nmercury in soil, crops, and aquatic biota and assesses the potential hazard to the local people \ncaused by Hg, Cd, and Pb in locally produced food sources. Greater detail on water and sediment \nquality monitoring is reported by Appleton (2000).  \n \n  4\n2. Sampling and analytical methods \n2.1 Sediment, soil and water  \nBottom sediment (BS) samples (Figure 1) were collected by wet screening of river or stream-bed \nsediment through a 150 \u00b5m sieve, using a minimal amount of water to avoid the loss of fine silt and \nclay fractions. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples were obtained by filtering 500 ml \nwater through 47 mm diameter, 0.45 \u00b5m Cellulose Nitrate Membrane Filters (Whatman\uf0d4) using \n250 ml and 500 ml capacity Nalgene\uf0d4 filter holders and receivers and a hand operated vacuum \npump. Filter membranes were carefully removed to avoid contamination and stored in 30 ml \nSterilin\uf0d4 tubes.  \nSoil sampling was carried out in the agricultural terrains adjacent to the Naboc River, comprising \n(i) the rice paddy fields of the Lower and Upper Naboc Communal Irrigation Systems; (ii) corn \nfields on non-irrigated land between the paddy fields and (iii) banana plantations adjacent to the \nAgusan River (Figure 1). Composite soil samples were collected from sites about 10-20 m apart at \nand immediately below the root depth of the rice, corn, and banana plants. Sediment and soil \nsamples were sealed in plastic securitainers to avoid evaporative losses and oxidation.  \nStream and well water pH, temperature, Eh, and conductivity were determined in the field using a \nseries of temperature-compensated electrodes and meters. Water samples for chemical analysis \nwere filtered through 50 mm diameter Sartorius Sartolab P\uf0d4 0.45 \u00b5m disposable SFCA \nmembranes using 50 ml disposable syringes and collected into 250 ml NalgeneTM LPDE bottles. \nSome water samples for analysis at the BGS were collected using 25 mm diameter, 0.45 \u00b5m \nMilliporeTM cellulose acetate membranes into 30 ml NalgeneTM HPDE bottles. At each site, the \nsuite of water samples collected included: (1) 250 ml filtered water preserved with 1% v\/v HNO3  \n(Merck) for determination of Hg, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd; and (2) 250 ml unfiltered water with pH \nadjusted to 12 with solid NaOH for CN analysis. A number of 30 ml samples, filtered and \npreserved with 0.3 ml conc. HNO3  + 0.3 ml 0.2 vol.% K2CrO7 were collected for total Hg analysis \nat the BGS by a UK Accrediatation Services cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopic (CV-\nAFS) method to a practical detection limit of 30 ng\/L using a PS-Analytical AFS. Quality control \n  5\nwas achieved by analysis of duplicates, blanks, aqueous quality control standards and \nAQUACHECK proficiency testing samples. Results for duplicate samples analysed in the BGS and \nthe Philippines Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) laboratories agreed well (Figure 2).  \nBottom sediment (BS), suspended sediment (SS) and soil samples were dried at <40\u00b0C. SS samples \nwere digested with the cellulose filter membrane in aqua regia at <50oC. Dried BS and soil samples \nwere disaggregated, hand ground in a porcelain mortar and pestle and 1.0g digested overnight in \n50% aqua regia at room temperature then gently refluxed for 2 hours at about 106oC, cooled and \nmade up to 20 ml.  For the determination of Hg, organically bound mercury was released by \noxidation with 6% potassium permanganate solution. Mercury in water, sediment and soil at the \nMGB was determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hiranuma HG-1) to a \ndetection limit of 0.1 \u00b5g\/L in water and 0.04 mg\/kg in sediment and soil  using SnCl2 as a reduction \nagent (Appleton, 2000). CN in filtered waters was determined by ion selective electrode (ISE) \nusing a Jenway 3340 Ion Meter. Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd in filtered waters and aqua regia soluble \nCu, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn in sediments and soils were determined by AAS using a Shimadzu AA-\n6800. Quality control of the MGB analysis was achieved by analysis of duplicates, blanks, aqueous \nand solid quality control standards (GXR-2), and by comparing MGB results with results for \nsamples analysed in the BGS laboratories (Figure 2). Mercury analyses of BS and soil samples at \nthe BGS were carried out on  1 g milled sub-amples, digested  overnight in 50% aqua regia at room \ntemperature then gently refluxed for 2 hours at about 140oC, cooled and made up to 50 ml. \nMercury was then determined by CV-AFS  to a practical detection limit for solid samples of 0.02 \nmg\/kg using a PS-Analytical AFS. Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn in a 5 ml aliquot of the aqua regia \ndigestate were determined by ICP-AES using a Varian\/Vista AX CCD simultaneous instrument \nwith dedicated Varian SPS-5 Autosampler.  Instrument calibration was achieved using mixed \nelement standards covering a range of concentrations and the instrument was re-calibrated after not \nmore than 40 samples.  Two quality control standards, high and low, were analysed after each \ncalibration, during the run, after no more than ten unknown solutions and at the end of each run to \ncheck for drift.  Blanks, calibration standards and quality control standards were matrix matched to \nthe samples to be analysed.  All reported measurements are based on the average of three replicate \n  6\nanalyses. National Research Council of Canada marine sediments BEST-1 and PACS-1 were used \nfor quality control. There was good agreement between the MGB and BGS results (Figure 2) \n \n2.2 Rice \nSamples of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain from a representative selection of sites within the Naboc, \nBabag, Mamonga, Tubo-Tubo area (Figure 1) were collected either (1) from the mature rice plants \nin situ, or (2) in the majority of cases, where rice had previously been harvested, samples were \ncollected from concrete drying beds. In the latter case, each sample comprised a composite of at \nleast 6 sub-samples of the rice being dried. Approximately 300g were taken for each location in a \nrandomised fashion. Samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in a fridge (5\u00b0C) before being \ndried and subsequently analysed. Grains were thoroughly washed once only and dried at a low \ntemperature (<40\u00b0C) in an oven until a constant weight was achieved. The hull of the rice was \nremoved prior to milling to a fine powder. Additionally, rice samples were cooked in the traditional \nway to assess the impact of cooking on Hg concentrations. 2 g of rice samples were digested using \nnitric and sulphuric acids (Adelojou et al., 1994). Organically bound mercury was released by \noxidation with 6% potassium permanganate solution and mercury was determined by flameless \natomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hiranuma HG-1) using SnCl2 as a reduction agent 5 g \nsubsamples were digested in concentrated  HNO3 and HCl at room temperature overnight, heated \non a hot plate, filtered, made up to 100 ml and analysed for Cd and Pb by AAS using a Shimadzu \nAA-6800. \nDuplicates, blanks, and certified international reference materials, including National Research \nCentre for Certified Reference Materials (NRCCRM) rice (GBW08508; 0.038 \u00b5g Hg\/g), and \nNational Research Council, TORT-1 (lobster hepatopancreas; 0.2185 \u00b5g Hg\/g) were used for \nquality control of rice, banana and aquatic biota analysis. The precision and bias of the chemical \nanalysis was less than 10% with the exception of some Pb results, which were re-determined to \nachieve the required precision (Weeks, 2000).   \n \n2.3 Bananas \n  7\nCommercial banana plantations between the Naboc and Mamunga Rivers are spray-irrigated with \nriver water. A thin white film of clay-silt was observed on the leaves and trunks of the banana \nplants at a site adjacent to the Naboc River, close to the confluence with the Agusan River. Other \nbanana plantations were spray irrigated with water pumped from the Agusan River. Nearly ripe \nbananas were cut from trees growing under protective plastic bags from three areas each under \ndifferent irrigation regimes. Bananas were taken from plantations in Mamonga (irrigated by the \nNaboc), and in Babag and Macopa (located 2 km WSW of Babag), both of which were irrigated by \nwaters from the Agusan River. Banana samples were stored at 5\u00b0C in a fridge and the edible part \nanalysed for Hg, Cd and Pb (see section 2.2). \n \n2.4 Aquatic biota \nMussels were collected from the Naboc River and a pond fed by the river, near to the village of \nNaboc (Figure 1). They were rinsed in clean bottled water; the edible soft tissues were carefully \nremoved from their shells and the gut contents discarded. Tissue samples were frozen in self-\nsealing plastic bags at \u201318 to -20\u00b0C (see Williams et al., 1999). Mussels are considered ideal as \nbiomonitors of heavy metal contamination on account of their limited mobility, widespread \ndistribution and tendency for biomagnification of ambient heavy metal concentrations. These \nfreshwater mussels also formed part of the human diet in the region. \nFish (Tilapia spp.) were collected by hook and line fishing from the Naboc River between Naboc \nand Babag villages and also from a tributary of the Agusan River. Muscle tissue was removed from \nthe freshly killed fish using stainless steel dissecting tools and frozen in Sterilin tubes at -18 to -\n20\u00b0C. Samples were analysed for Hg, Cd and Pb using the methods described in section 2.2.  \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1 Water quality  \n  8\nHg in filtered water samples from the Naboc River (Table 1) exceeds the Philippine water quality \ncriteria for both the protection of public health (2 \u00b5g Hg\/L as total mercury; DENR Administrative \nOrder No. 34, 1990) and fisheries (5\u00b5g\/L; maximum limit for total Hg; UNEP, 2002). Water from \nthe Naboc River is not abstracted for drinking because it is extremely turbid as a result of \ndischarges from the Diwalwal artisanal mine workings and mineral processing plants. Whereas \nhigh Hg loads in solution have been reported previously (Appleton et al., 1999) the general decline \nin the use of amalgamation for gold extraction suggests that the risk from Hg in solution has \ndeclined. \nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) in the Naboc River exceed the DENR Class D water quality criteria \n(100 mg\/L) by a factor of 2 to 73, declining to 59 mg\/L in the Agusan River, about 5 km \ndownstream of the confluence with Naboc River (Table 1). High suspended sediment load in the \nNaboc River will effectively prevent the survival of most aquatic macrobiota. \nCyanide exceeded DENR drinking water quality criteria (50 \u00b5g CN\/l) at the Depot site, but \ndecreased to about 35 \u00b5g\/L in the lower reaches of the Naboc River. Quality criteria for Hg and CN \nare not exceeded in water samples from drinking water wells in the Tubo Tubo, Naboc, Mamonga \nand Babag areas. \nShort-term temporal variation was recorded in Hg and CN concentrations in filtered water samples, \nas well as Hg in SS and TSS (Appleton, 2000). This short-term temporal variation in the chemistry \nof filtered water and suspended particulate matter is very characteristic of rivers impacted by \nartisanal and small-scale gold mining areas and is an important factor to consider when setting up a \nwater quality monitoring system. If the temporal variations related to changes in contaminant fluxes \nand hydraulic regime that have been recorded during the present survey are a common occurrence, then \nconcentrations higher than those recorded are likely to occur and may pose a significant hazard to \naquatic biota.  \n \n3.2 Sediment quality  \n  9\nHg in bottom sediment in the Naboc River varies within a relatively restricted range of 13 to 55 \nmg\/kg (Table 2) and is still quite high in SS and BS in the Agusan River, approximately 5 km \nbelow the confluence with the Naboc River (20-25 mg\/kg; Figure 1). Historical data indicates that \nHg declines to 2 mg\/kg at a site approximately 60 km further downstream (Appleton et al., 1999). \nThese bottom sediments are a long-term source of Hg contamination and release of Hg into river \nwater may occur as a result of methylation of Hg in bottom sediment. There is also the risk that Hg \ncontaminated sediments will be transferred downstream during periods of high hydraulic flow. Hg \nconcentrations in bottom and suspended sediment in the Naboc and Agusan Rivers (Table 2) \nexceed the Environment Canada Toxic Effects Threshold for the Protection of Aquatic Life (1 \nmg\/kg; Haines et al., 1994) by factors of up to 55 and 166, respectively. \nSignificant Spearman correlation coefficients were recorded between (1) pH, Na, Hg, CN and \nsulphate in filtered water; (2) TSS and (3) Hg and Pb in BS (Figure 3). This reflects the multi-\ncomponent contamination derived from the Diwalwal mining settlement, comprising Hg from \namalgamation, Na and high pH from cyanidation, and Pb from mineralization.  \n \n3.3 Soil quality \nRice paddy fields in the Lower and Upper Naboc Communal Irrigation Systems have been irrigated \nfour times a year over the last decade using Hg-contaminated water from the Naboc River. It is \nreported that 5 to 15 cm of silt has been deposited in rice paddy fields during the 1990\u2019s and that in \nsome areas 2 to 5 cm of silt is ploughed into the top 10-20 cm of the soil profile every year. \nConsequently Hg contaminated silt containing 29-89 mg\/kg Hg (Table 3) will be thoroughly mixed \ninto the rice root zone. Hg in rice paddy field soils range between 0.05 to 96 mg\/kg (average 24 \nmg\/kg; median 12 mg\/kg). There is, as would be expected, lateral variation in the Hg concentration \naway from where silt laden irrigation water enters a field. For example, Hg declines from 66 mg\/kg \nwhere irrigation water enters one paddy the field to 4 mg\/kg in the centre of the field, a distance of \nabout 250 metres. Cu and Zn exhibit no vertical variation with depth in the soil profile whereas Pb \nand Hg decrease by a factor of 2 to 4 (Table 4). \n  10\nHg in the majority of the rice paddy soils exceeded (1) the maximum permissible concentration of \nHg in agricultural soil in the UK (1 mg\/kg); (2) the Canadian Soil Quality Guideline for \nagricultural soils (6.6 mg\/kg); (3) the UK soil guideline value for inorganic Hg for allotments (8 \nmg\/kg; Environment Agency, 2002); (4) the proposed Dutch Intervention value (SRC - \u201cserious \nrisk concentration\u201d) for inorganic Hg (36 mg\/kg; RIVM, 2001); (5) the USEPA soil ingestion Soil \nScreening Level (SSL) for inorganic Hg (23 mg\/kg); and the USEPA SSL for inhalation of \nvolatiles (10 mg\/kg; USEPA, 1996). However Hg in the Naboc paddy soils does not exceed either \nthe Dutch proposed human health SRC of 210 mg\/kg or the USEPA generic SSL for plant uptake \n(270 mg\/kg), which implies that the plant uptake pathway is not regarded as a major contributor to \nexposure compared with soil ingestion (USEPA, 1996). Limit values for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in \nagricultural soils adopted by the UK are not exceeded in any of the soil samples (Table 3), neither \nare the Dutch SRCs for human health or the USEPA SSLs for soil uptake (USEPA, 1996) for Cd \n(24-28 mg\/kg) and Pb (400-622 mg\/kg). \nMuch lower Hg concentrations within the range expected for uncontaminated soils, characterise \nsoils on which corn and bananas are cultivated, largely because these are not irrigated with Hg-\ncontaminated water from the Naboc River. With the exception of one sample (0.98 mg\/kg Hg), \nwhich was taken from a corn field that appeared to have been used previously for rice cultivation, \nall corn soils have Hg concentrations below 0.5 mg\/kg.  \nThe close correlation between Hg and Pb in the rice paddy soils mirrors a similar correlation in \nbottom sediments (Figure 3). pH measured in a selection of soils revealed a range of 5.3 to 7.2 but \nno significant correlations could be detected between pH, Hg, Cd, or Pb. \n  \n3.4 Rice \nConcentrations of Hg in rice ranged from 0.008 \u2013 0.050 \u00b5g Hg\/g (wet weight) and between 0.009 \u2013 \n0.058 \u00b5g\/g dry weight (Table 5). Both cooking the rice by boiling and polishing reduced the level \nof total inorganic mercury (Table 5). Hg in rice commonly consumed in Saudi Arabia averages \n0.0032 \u00b5g\/g (range < DL \u2013 0.0436 \u00b5g\/g; Al-Saleh & Shinwari, 2001), whereas a value of \n0.0052\u00b5g\/g was reported for commercial rice from Italy (Horvat et al., 2003) and 0.005 to 0.034 \n  11\n\u00b5g\/g in wild rice from northern Wisconsin (Bennett et al., 2000). Rice from the mercury-polluted \nNiigata area of Japan averages 0.003 \u00b5g\/g (Nakagawa and Yumita, 1998; soil Hg 0.155 \u00b5g\/g) and \nrice cultivated close to a chlor alkali industrial plant in Ganjam, India (Lenka et al., 1992) \ncontained 0.008 \u00b5g\/g. Much higher concentrations ranging up to 0.57 \u00b5g\/g were recorded from the \nmercury polluted areas of Wansham and Quingzhen in Guizhou province of China (Horvat et al., \n2003). \n \nNo significant correlation could be detected between Hg in rice and soil samples collected from the \nsame general area as where the rice was grown (Figure 4). However, it is difficult to make direct \ncomparison between Hg concentrations in composite soil samples, comprising sub-samples \ncollected from sites about 10-20 m apart and wherever practicable, from two to three adjacent \npaddy fields, with Hg concentrations in rice grain samples that represent much larger areas. \nUnfortunately it was not possible to collect soil and rice samples from exactly the same sites \nbecause the rice had been harvested shortly before the field programme was carried out.  \n \nThe relationship between Hg in soil and un-cooked rice from the Naboc area is compared with data \nfrom the Wansham and Quingzhen areas (Horvat et al., 2003) in Figure 5. This illustrates the much \nhigher concentrations of Hg in rice from the mercury mining area of Wansham whereas rice \nsamples from the vicinity of the chemical plant at Quingzhen, where mercury is used as a catalyst \nfor the production of acetic acid, are similar to Hg levels in the Naboc rice. There appeared to be no \ncorrelation between Hg in rice and soil in either area in China (Horvat et al., 2003).    \n \nCd in Naboc rice ranges from 0.057 to 1.025 \u00b5g\/g with a mean of 0.29 \u00b5g \/g whilst Pb ranges from \n<0.01 to 0.430  \u00b5g\/g with a mean of 0.0479 \u00b5g\/g (Table 5). In Korea, rice grain grown on soils \ndeveloped from cadmium-rich uraniferous black shales ranged between 0.1 to 3.5 \u00b5g Cd \/g (dry \nweight) with an average concentration of 0.6 \u00b5g\/g (Kim & Thornton, 1988). In the Yugu-\nKwangcheon Au-Ag Province of Korea, average concentrations of Cd and Pb in the most \ncontaminated paddy soils range up to 8.2 \u00b5g\/g Cd and 192 \u00b5g\/g Pb, whereas corresponding Pb \n  12\nconcentrations in rice grain and sesame from these soils ranged between 0.4 \u00b5g\/g and 6.8 \u00b5g\/g \n(Kim et al., 1998). Watanabe et al. (1989) reported geometric mean contents of Cd and Pb in \nPhilippine rice of 0.020 \u00b5g Cd\/g and 0.016 \u00b5g Pb\/g (dry weight) respectively compared with world \ngeometric means of 0.02 \u00b5g Cd\/g (dry wt.) and 0.016 \u00b5g\/g Pb (Watanabe et al., 1996). Zhang et al. \n(1996) found that Pb in Philippines rice grain averaged 0.0376 \u00b5g Pb\/g. Cadmium and lead in 27 \nrice grain samples commonly consumed in Saudi Arabia have mean concentrations and ranges of \n0.02 (range < DL-0.18) \u00b5g\/g and 0.135 (range 0.02-1.53 \u00b5g\/g), respectively (Al-Saleh and \nShinwari, 2001).   \n \nRice is generally grown under both oxidising and reducing soil conditions and these conditions will \ninfluence the metal uptake by plants. Many investigations have demonstrated that the availability \nof metals decreased under submerged conditions due to processes of precipitation with hydrides, \ncarbonates and sulphide and iron compounds. Factors influencing metal uptake by rice include soil \npH, redox potential, organic matter content, phosphorus content, temperature and time and \nadditionally the cultivar of rice grown (Jung & Thornton, 1997; McLaughlin et al., 1999). One of \nthe most important factors affecting metal bioavailability is soil pH. A relatively low metal uptake \nby rice is found under reducing conditions due to increasing soil pH. Jung & Thornton (1997) \nshowed that metal concentrations in rice plant stalks growing under reducing conditions were lower \nthan those growing under oxidising conditions. Other studies have shown that an increase in soil \norganic matter content increased the exchangeable Fe and Mn in soils under flooded conditions and \nthus decreases the availability of metals to plants. \nIt is also possible that HgS may form in the anoxic layers of rice paddy soils, thereby making the \nHg relatively unavailable to plants. However, this is only likely to occur in relatively high sulphur \nconditions. Equally, adsorption of Hg onto secondary Fe hydroxides when the paddy soil dries out \nand becomes oxidised will also reduce bioavailability, as will adsorption of Hg onto organic matter \nin the paddy soils. The availability of metals typically decreases under submerged conditions due to \nsoil metal precipitation, metal sorption and a range of other factors. Lee et al. (1996) reported an \nincrease of soil pH with increases in the duration of the flooding period for acidic soils, and this \n  13\nresults in greater Cd availability reflecting the dynamic change in the chemical forms of Cd in soils \nunder various flooded conditions. Soil Hg generally has a low availability and plant roots act as a \nbarrier to Hg uptake. In addition, demethylation of Hg in the upper 10-15 cm of the soil profile \nmay reduce Hg availability. These factors may together explain why relatively little Hg appears to \nbe taken up by the rice plants in the Naboc area. This is fortunate because significant brain damage \nin animals (rats) is associated with the consumption of Hg polluted rice (average 0.14 mg\/kg) from \nGuizhou province, China (Wang et al. 2004). \n \nThe uptake of Hg is generally much less than for Cd or Zn, which would explain the relatively high \nsoil\/rice grain rations for Hg compared with Cd (Tables 3 and 5). Watanabe et al. (1996) reported \nhigh Cd contents in rice harvested from paddy fields with elevated soil Cd, whereas Cd in Naboc \nrice is high in relation to the level of Cd in paddy soils (<1 mg\/kg; Table3). Absorption of Cd may \nbe influenced by flooding the paddy fields, which controls the redox potential of the soil, and hence \nthe uptake of Cd by rice plants.  \n \n3.5 Banana \nHg, Cd and Pb in banana (Table 6) are low and within appropriate food safety standards \nfor such items. The bananas were commercially grown for export and local consumption is \nvery restricted. The low concentrations are compatible with concentrations in the soils \n(Table 3).  \n \n3.6 Fish and mussels \nHg in Tilapia spp. from the Naboc River (0.277 \u00b5g\/g) is twice as high as in fish from the Agusan \nRiver (0.125 \u00b5g\/g; Table 7), reflecting differences in water, suspended and bottom sediment \nchemistry in these two rivers (Tables 1 & 2). Total Hg in fish muscle tissue does not exceed the \nmaximum recommended limit commonly allowed for fish in most countries (0.5 mg Hg\/kg wet \nweight; UNEP, 2002). Hg in the soft edible tissues of 64% of the mussel samples exceeds the 0.5 \n  14\nmg Hg\/kg wet weight allowed for fisheries products in the European Community although only \n18% of the mussel samples exceed the maximum allowable\/recommended level for shellfish in the \nUSA (1 mg methyl Hg\/kg; UNEP, 2002). Hg in fish from the Naboc River is much higher than in \nmarine biota (0.004-0.063 \u00b5g\/g) in the artisanal gold mining impacted area of Libay (Zamboanga \ndel Norte, Mindanao) where sediment Hg concentrations are much lower (0.035 \u00b5g\/g) ( Maramba \net al., 2004). Low concentrations of THg in freshwater fish (0.012 \u00b5g\/g) and clams (0.18 \u00b5g\/g) \n(Ramirez et al. 2004) and 0.01 \u00b5g\/g in Tilapia (Akagi et al., 2000) have been reported also from the \nTagum artisanal gold processing area, Mindanao.  \n3.7 Metal intake related to rice, fish, and mussel consumption  \n \nThe dietary intake of rice by the local residents in the Naboc area is estimated to be 300g (air- \ndried) per person per day. The average Hg concentration in rice grain grown in the study area was \n0.0149 \u00b5g\/g (dry wt.), so the amount of mercury entering the body, assuming that locally grown \nrice is washed and cooked, is 4.47 \u00b5g Hg \/day. (0.03 mg\/week). This value is much lower than the \nProvisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 0.3 mg for mercury in the diet set by the WHO and \nthe FAO, of which the maximum intake of MeHg should be no more than 1.6 \u00b5g\/ kg bw \n(FAO\/WHO, 2003). If 50% of the Hg in Naboc rice were MeHg (see Horvat et al., 2003), then the \ntotal weekly MeHg burden from rice would be 15 \u00b5g MeHg equivalent to only 0.25 \u00b5g\/ kg bw for \nan adult (bw 60 kg). Average total Hg intake for consumers of Naboc rice is also lower than the \nJapanese safe guideline limit (0.036 mg\/day for an adult weighing 50 kg; Nakagawa & Yumita, \n1998) as well as the Provisional Tolerable Daily Intake (PTDI) for adults (0.47 \u00b5g\/ kg bw\/day) and \nfor pregnant women and children (0.2 \u00b5g\/ kg bw\/day) in Canada. However, individuals consuming \npolished and cooked Naboc rice at the upper limit of the Hg concentration range (0.037 \u00b5g\/g) \nwould have a daily intake of 0.185 \u00b5g\/ kg bw\/day, which is almost equal to the Canadian PTDI for \nchildren and pregnant women.  \n \nThe average Cd concentration in rice grain grown in the Naboc area was 0.2907 \u00b5g Cd g-1 (wet wt.) \nso the average daily intake of Cd from consuming 300g of rice is 87.2 \u00b5g Cd, or 610 \u00b5g per week. \n  15\nThis exceeds the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 420 \u00b5g Cd recommended by the \nJoint FAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).  \n \nThe average Pb concentration in rice grain grown in the Naboc area is 0.0479 \u00b5g\/g (wet wt.) so the \naverage daily intake of Pb from consuming 300g of rice is 14.3 \u00b5g Pb, or 100 \u00b5g per week. This is \nonly 6.8% of the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 1470 \u00b5g Pb recommended by the \nJoint FAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).  \n \nFish and fish products are the dominant sources of methyl mercury in the diet and levels greater \nthan 1200 \u00b5g\/kg have been found in edible marine species such as tuna and swordfish. Similar \nlevels have also been recorded in fish from polluted freshwaters. Consumption of 250g of fish from \nthe Naboc River four times a week would result in an intake of 277 \u00b5g Hg\/week (Table 7). This \nvalue is close to the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 300 \u00b5g for total mercury in \nthe diet recommended by JECFA. If 80% of the total Hg in the Naboc fish is MeHg, then the \nweekly intake is approximately 220 \u00b5g MeHg (3.33 \u00b5g\/kg bw), which is double the JECFA PTWI \nof 1.6 \u00b5g\/kg bw (FAO\/WHO, 2003). Consumption of 100g of the edible portions of freshwater \nmussels from the Naboc River and adjacent ponds (average 0.59 \u00b5g Hg\/g; Table 7) each week \nwould result in an additional MeHg burden of about 50 \u00b5g MeHg\/week. \n4. Conclusions  \n \nHg in the majority of the rice paddy soils exceeded the UK and Canadian soil quality thresholds for \nagricultural soils as well as the proposed Dutch Intervention value and the USEPA soil ingestion \nSoil Screening Level (SSL) for inorganic Hg, although concentrations are less than the Dutch \nproposed human health value and the USEPA generic SSL for plant uptake. Limit values for Cd, \nCu, Pb and Zn in agricultural soils adopted by the UK are not exceeded in any of the soil samples. \nMuch lower Hg concentrations within the range expected for uncontaminated soils, characterise \n  16\nsoils on which corn and bananas are cultivated, largely because these are not irrigated with Hg-\ncontaminated water from the Naboc River.   \nThe estimated total weekly MeHg intake for a person living in the Naboc-Babag area related to the \nweekly consumption of 2.1 kg of locally grown rice (15 \u00b5g MeHg), 1 kg of fish (220 \u00b5g MeHg) \nand 100g of mussels (50 \u00b5g MeHg), both from the Naboc River, would total 285 \u00b5g MeHg \n(equivalent to 4.75 \u00b5g MeHg\/kg bw for a 60 kg adult) which is almost 3 times the JECFA PTWI of \n1.6 \u00b5g\/kg bw. This will significantly contribute to the population mercury exposure and might \nexplain why 38% of the local inhabitants were classified as Hg intoxicated during a mercury \ntoxicity assessment (Drasch et al., 2001). Some local people are reported to eat locally caught fish \nup to three times a day (Drasch et al., 2001), which would substantially increase their exposure to \nmethyl mercury. Not consuming local fish would produce the greatest reduction in exposure to \nmethyl mercury. Inadvertent ingestion of soil containing 24 mg Hg\/kg at a rate of 20 mg\/day \n(WHO, 2001) or 50mg\/day (Campbell, 2003) would give an additional estimated weekly intake of \nbetween 3 and 8 \u00b5g THg. The importance of dermal absorption of inorganic mercury and methyl \nmercury from paddy soil has not been considered but may be an additional exposure route for \nfarmers and their families in the Naboc area. The same applies to the occasional deliberate \nconsumption of soil (pica) or the persistent and purposeful consumption of soil (geophagia), \nalthough geophagia is not known to be practised in the Naboc area. A more comprehensive \nassessment of all Hg exposure routes that includes a systematic dietary survey covering the full \nrange of food types is now required, especially as no plans to remediate the mercury contaminated \nsoils of the Naboc Irrigation Systems have yet been reported. We further recommend the \ndevelopment of a set of water quality criteria specific for this site that would serve as a basis for \ncontrolling discharges or releases of heavy metals in the water. These recommended human health \nwater quality criteria would not impose legally binding requirements but would serve to protect the \nhealth of consumers of non-commercial freshwater fish. In addition it is recommended that no \nchange of land use from rice to other crops, such as corn, should be permitted unless it can be \ndemonstrated that the alternative crops do not absorb Hg to levels that could further enhance the \nlevel of human exposure to mercury. \n  17\n \nPostscript  \nThe government took control of the mining and mineral processing activities at Diwalwal in 2002 \nfollowing which mineral processing by mini-CIP plants and ball mills was required to follow \nenvironmental and safety rules. Miners constructed their own mini mine tailings dam to \ntemporarily store mine wastes instead of dumping them directly into the Naboc River. The \ngovernment also terminated the operation of three big mineral processors thereby reducing \nproduction from 500-700 tons to just 100 tons per day. It is reported that attempts will be made to \nrehabilitate the Naboc River once the Mabatas tailings dam has been constructed. Recent DENR-\nEMB monitoring has shown that these changes have produced a significant improvement in the \nwater quality of the Naboc River with Hg below the permitted level of 0.002 \u00b5g\/L and cyanide \nbelow the water quality criteria for fresh waters of 0.05 mg\/L. Siltation in the lower Naboc has \ndeclined to a third of previous levels and TSS in the rest of the river system is now within the \npublic water supply quality standard of 50 mg\/L.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe co-operation and enthusiastic support of the following MGB staff involved in the field work \n(Conrado Miranda, Danilo Berches, Alfredo Relampagos, Patrocinio Simbajon, Jr.) and laboratory \nanalysis (Edith Macalalad, Josephine Uyaco, Teresita Balmes, Ophelia Arreza, and Belen Cawad), \nis acknowledged with thanks.
