This results in significant challenges both in the measurement of the flows experimentally \nand the modeling of the flows numerically [1]. \nThe most basic flow structure has been investigated by Carr [2] who demonstrated the existence \nof a transverse vortex behind the backlight of a notchback vehicle. More recently, using model \ntesting and numerical modelling at low Reynolds number, Nouzawa et. al. [3] established an \nalternative structure of the near-wake. Here the vortex behind the backlight window consisted of \nan arch shape, but with the same characteristics as the transverse vortex proposed by Carr [2], \nbut to which two trailing vortices are added originating from the rear-pillar flow separation. Further \nnumerical developments at low Reynolds number have shown that the arch vortex exhibits a \ncharacteristic frequency consistent with a shedding frequency scale to the vehicle characteristic \nlength and freestream velocity. Further work by Jenkins [4] has shown that the flow separation \noccurring at the roof trailing edge was dominated by two bootdeck vortices, contra rotating and in \nan opposite sense to the rear-pillar vortices, formed behind the backlight and extended toward \nthe centre of the bootdeck. However, the investigation did not allow a complete description of the \nflow structure. \nWork by Carr [5] has also proposed, that that three basic flow structures exist in the bookdeck \nregion which depend on the geometric shape of the vehicle described in terms of the backlight \nangle \uf061, the declination angle \uf062 and the bootdeck length L. These three flow configuration were \nlinked to generic vehicle types described as the Notchback, the Estate and the Fastback car [5]. \nOf these three types, published work is most detailed for the Notchback and Estate car \nconfigurations. \nFor the Notchback car, recent work by Gilhome [6,7] has focused on an experimental \ninvestigation of the flow structure over a sedan vehicle. The work has combined on-road and wind \ntunnel full-scale tests at Reynolds numbers up to 6.5\uf0b410\n6\n. Both the time-averaged and \ninstantaneous near-wake structure were analysed. Surface flow visualisation also indicated the \npresence of unstable node points (or nodes of attachment), saddle points (a singularity between \ninward and outward flows) and unstable foci centres consistent with a vortex stretching from \nthose points in the streamwise direction. Work by Jenkins [4] on an Estate type configuration also \nconfirmed the existence of similar flow structures. These basic flow structures are summarised in \nFigure 1. \nInvestigation of the unsteady nature of the flow field in this region leads to a dominant unsteady \nhorseshoe vortex structure which is periodically shed from the rear-pillars. This periodic shedding \nresults in the separation region behind the backlight also having unstable characteristics. \nGilhome\u2019s analysis [6] of unsteady surface pressures and corresponding spectra revealed two \ncharacteristic frequencies associated with the near-wake of the vehicle. The corresponding \nStrouhal numbers, based on the reattachment length, were 0.11 and 0.42 respectively where \nStrouhal number is defined by: \nRfxSt\nU\uf0a5\n\uf03d  \ngiven a vortex shedding frequency f, a reattachment length xR and a freestream velocity of U\uf0a5. \nThe lower frequency was associated with a flapping motion of the shear layer, whereas the higher \nfrequency was attributed to the vortex shedding from the rear-pillar. \nIn the present study, data obtained using a nominally 1\/3\nrd\n scale passenger saloon car model is \npresented using conventional time-averaged pressure measurement, unsteady pressure \nmeasurement, flow visualisation and the advanced optical measurement technique particle image \nvelocimetry (PIV) [8,9]. Given the growing use of these advanced optical techniques, a number of \noptical methods which are available to the wind tunnel instrumentation engineer, are also \nreviewed. This is considered important, as the availability of measurement methods such as PIV \nnow offer the potential to increase understanding of both the time-averaged and unsteady flow \nfields. To this end, results from the measurements in this paper confirm a number of the complex \nflow structures predicted by previous workers and also show unexpected sensitivity of the flow to \nReynolds number which has not been reported before. \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n3 \n \n \n2 ADVANCED OPTICAL METHODS \n \nA number of advanced optical techniques are available for wind tunnel measurement. Although \nthese methods are generally highly mature, application of these techniques to automotive wind \ntunnels, which are typically large scale and are low to medium speed, presents significant \nchallenges. These challenges include optical access, the large volumes to be measured and \nensuring sufficient seeding particles of the right size are present in the flow region of interest. In \nthis section, we will briefly review three of the techniques available for wind tunnel measurement \nincluding laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global \nvelocimetry (DGV). \n \n2.1 Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) \nLDA is a well established point wise velocity measurement technique. Its maturity is reflected in \ndetailed descriptions of the technique as published by Drain [10], Durst et al [11] and more \nrecently Albrecht et al [12]. In another configuration similar to LDA, phase Doppler anemometry \n(PDA) is used to measure both velocity and particle size simultaneously [13]. The most common \n3D LDA set-up is illustrated in Figure 2. In this configuration, three colours are used in crossed \nbeam arrangements to interrogate a single coincident point in the fluid and the three individual \ncomponents are then transformed into 3D velocity data. Many of the commercial systems \ncombine the transmission and receiving optics for one or two components into one probe in a \nbackscatter arrangement. This has an advantage when optical access may be limited to a single \nwindow. LDA offers high accuracy and spatial resolution (typically less than 0.5% error in mean \nvelocity) and allows measurement of fundamental parameters such as turbulence intensity and \nReynolds stresses. But as instantaneous flow structure cannot be measured, LDA measurements \nare sometimes complemented by PIV flow studies as well. \nGiven the maturity of LDA as a turn-key technique and the limited review space allowed in this \narticle, only a small number of application examples can be listed here. In work by Jeffrey and \nZhang [14], 3D LDA measurements were taken from a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of a \nNACA 0012 symmetrical aerofoil section. Measurements were completed in both a 3.5m x 2.5m \nand 2.1m x 1.7m wind tunnel working sections. In this case specialised stable probe mounts and \na commercial smoke generator were used. Another example of application of LDA in large scale \nfacilities includes helicopter rotor model measurements [15]. In both cases the optics set-up \nrequired careful attention with large focal length lenses at significant cost in order to obtain the \nrequired accuracy and performance. \n \n2.2 Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) \nPIV is a development of the laser speckle velocimetry (LSV) technique as originally demonstrated \nby Dudderar et. al. in 1977 [16]. PIV is a planar velocity measurement technique which in its \nsimplest form uses a multiple pulsed laser sheet placed in the plane of interest of the seeded fluid \n(see Figure 3). Images are recorded from the light sheet using either a digital or a photographic \ncamera and subsequently processed using optical or digital correlation techniques to yield a two-\ndimensional (2D) velocity vector map of the flow [8,9].  \nMore recent advances allow the simpler 2D PIV technique to be extended to 3D by using \nstereoscopic methods [17] and the commercial turn-key systems permit relatively simple \napplication of stereoscopic PIV to an area of interest. Details of such a system are outlined later \nin this paper as the technique is applied to our wind tunnel model. Further advances in the 3D \nPIV technique to a 3D volume measurement also include scanning sheet methods [18], defocus \nmethods [19] and holographic methods [20,21], although none of these as yet have been \ncomprehensively applied to a large wind tunnel environment. In addition, high speed digital \ncameras now allow measurement of PIV data, in 2D and stereoscopic arrangements, at kHz \nframe rates thus allowing the study of temporal complex turbulent flow structures [22,23]. A \ncomprehensive guide outlining the major developments and methods in PIV over the last 10 \nyears has been published by Raffel et al [24]. \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n4 \nApplication of the PIV method to large wind tunnels has been successful in a number of cases. \nThese include PIV wake measurements from helicopter rotors and wings in facilities with working \nsections areas as large as 9.5m x 9.5m [25,26]. The size of the facilities has required special \nsystems to be developed such as large scale atomisers for seeding, customised light sheet optics \nand specialised camera mounts. Also 2D PIV measurements of a wing tip vortex from a NACA \n0015 profile have been taken using another large scale facility (9m x 9m working section area) \nwith successful tracking of vortex flow structures [27]. Other work includes wake measurements \nfrom a rotor system [28] and wakes generated behind an Ahmed geometry generic car model \n[29]. In the later case, the PIV data has shown the vortex drag from the Ahmed body to peak at a \nhatchback angle of 30\no\n. \n \n2.3 Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV) \nDGV, like PIV, is a planar technique which will measure up to three velocity components from the \nflow. The technique was first conceived by a number of independent research groups over 10 \nyears ago [30,31]. Comprehensive reviews on DGV have been completed by a number of authors \n[32-36]. Described briefly and with reference to Figure 4 which shows a 1D system, the technique \ndirectly measures the Doppler shift of light scattered from seeding particles in a light sheet given \nthe wavelength of the incident light and knowing the geometry of the configuration which can also \nbe obtained through direct calibration methods.  \nIn practice this Doppler measurement is achieved by the use of an iodine absorption filter that is \nintegrated into the imaging optics and a frequency stabilised laser tuned to the required point on \nthe iodine absorption line. At each corresponding point in the flow, the resultant signal image will \nthen have pixel values proportional to the seeding particles velocity with the geometry of the set-\nup referenced to a sensitivity vector and the laser frequency. Thus the technique offers the \npotential to yield one velocity vector from each pixel and with optical processing speeds, at near \nCCD frame rates. Also since the technique is simply dependent on the Doppler shift, many of the \nseeding restrictions of PIV can be removed by using smaller seeding with corresponding gains in \nscattering efficiency [8] and advantages in large scale wind tunnel environments. Disadvantages, \nhowever, as with LDA, include the requirement for three views or different laser sheet directions \n[37] to obtain the three components. Also the accuracy of measurement is dependent on laser \nand iodine cell stability [38] and sensitivity vector error at each pixel and this restricts the best \nexpected errors to between 0.5-1m\/s [37,39,40]. Thus the technique is generally unsuitable for \nlow speed flows (less than 10m\/s) but still offers potential for measurements from automotive \nwind tunnels which can typically be taken at 50m\/s. \nApplication of DGV to a large wind tunnel environment and high speed wind tunnels requires a \nhighly refined optical set-up and calibration procedure. This has resulted in initial DGV systems \nbeing developed by specialist groups who have matured their systems by incorporating many \nongoing improvements [41-44]. These refined systems, however, have allowed DGV \nmeasurements to be made in large scale wind tunnels such as the NASA Ames 40 x 80 foot [41] \nand at Mach numbers of up to 0.74 in the ONERA T2 transonic facility [44]. \n \n3 EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP \n \nThe following will now describe the different set-ups for the experimental measurements. These \ntechniques include those for the flow visualisation, the static pressure measurements and the PIV \nset-up. PIV in this case was the method of choice as it allows rapid acquisition over a plane of \ninterest thus reducing the seeding period which can be an issue in a large wind tunnel volume. \nDue to it\u2019s planar nature, it also records a greater number of data points than LDA over the same \ntime period. Although DGV would relax some of the seeding requirements, however, it is not \navailable at the time of writing as a turn-key solution and thus requires specialist instrumentation \nknowledge and equipment. \n \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n5 \n3.1 Wind tunnel set-up \nThe  model notchback car was placed in the closed working section of the Cranfield University \n2.4m x 1.8m closed return wind tunnel. The wind tunnel working section has a length of 4m and \nthe facility for a rolling road ground simulation with upstream ground plane boundary layer \nsuction. In this case, although the boundary layer suction was activated, the rolling road was not \nused as the model had fixed wheels and also because all the measurements were completed on \nthe upper surface of the car. The model was secured to the floor at four points via the wheels and \naligned with the freestream.  \nThe nominally 1\/3\nrd\n scale model was representative of a modern notchback saloon with a length \nof 1750mm. In this case, given the limitations of the wind tunnel, the Reynolds numbers tested \nand scaled with respect to model length, are listed in table 1. \nThus, within the range of speed allowed by the wind tunnel, the test Reynolds number will be \nfrom 3 to 20 times smaller than for the full-scale vehicle. However, given the relatively high \nReynolds number in these test cases, it was not expected that the flow structure would be \nsensitive to changes in Reynolds number within the range allowable. \n \n3.2 Flow visualisation \nFlow visualisation was carried out in three different ways. Firstly the flow structure behind the \nrear-window was studied using smoke and illuminated with a laser sheet located along the model \ncenterline. The smoke was introduced at mid-height of the rear window, using a tube coming from \nthe front face of the model and attached to the car surface in such a way that it would cause \nminimum interference with the flow. The tests were run at relatively low speeds since the smoke \nentrainment mechanism was only visible for speeds below 18 m\/s. Thus recordings were made \nfor speeds between U\uf0a5 =  6 and U\uf0a5 = 18 m\/s, corresponding to Reynolds between 0.74 \uf0b410\n6 \n\u2013 \n2.22\uf0b410\n6\n. \nThe second flow visualisation method involved attaching short nylon tufts over the rear window \nand the bootdeck of the model. A camera was then fixed above the test section ceiling overhead \nthe rear of the model in order to record the motions of the tufts when running the tests at different \nspeeds. The tuft distribution is illustrated in Figure 5. The tests were performed for speeds \nbetween U\uf0a5 = 10 m\/s and U\uf0a5 = 40m\/s, which correspond to a range of Reynolds numbers \nbetween 1.23\uf0b410\n6\n \u2013 4.93\uf0b410\n6\n. Between different runs, the wind tunnel was stopped in order to \nrealign the tufts with tunnel axis. \nThe final method of flow visualisation used surface oil flow in which a fluorescent pigment is \nsuspended in paraffin. During the model preparation, the oil mixture was spread over the model \nsurface at zero wind and the formation of the subsequent surface streamline pattern was \nrecorded using the previous visualisation camera fixed above the test section ceiling. During each \ntest, the wind tunnel was run for sufficient time to allow the oil mixture to dry. Recordings were \nmade at U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s and U\uf0a5 = 40 m\/s, which correspond to Reynolds numbers of 3.09\uf0b410\n6\n and \n4.93\uf0b410\n6\n respectively. \n \n3.3 Static pressure measurements \nA total of 35 surface static pressure tappings were made in the bootdeck area of the model. The \ntappings were positioned in the backlight, the mid-boot, the end-boot area and along the \nbootdeck centerline and were located in order to capture steady and unsteady flow features \nreported by previous workers including the separation bubble and the vortex structures. Figure 6 \nillustrates these pressure tapping positions on the model where the coordinate origin is positioned \nat, the model centerline (x = 0), the wind tunnel floor (y = 0) and the model rear end (z = 0). \nEach pressure tapping was connected to a port on a Scanivalve head via a 1.1m long pneumatic \ntube with suitable wall stiffness characteristics to facilitate both steady and unsteady pressure \nmeasurements. An additional Scanivalve port was also used as an atmospheric reference \npressure for all the measurements. \n \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n6 \n3.3.1 Steady pressure measurements \nPreliminary measurements were made at U\uf0a5 = 25m\/s, 30m\/s, 35m\/s and 40m\/s, to ensure the \nsuitability of a pressure transducer with a full scale range of 0.1 psi. Further tests were completed \nacross a range of transducer sampling frequencies from 400Hz \u2013 700Hz.  \nThe pressure data were corrected to allow for test section blockage of 8% based on the model \nmaximum cross sectional area. Finally to ensure static pressure measurement insensitivity to \nboundary layer conditions, two tests were performed: one involving a transition point fixed \nupstream from the model roof trailing edge and a second one with transition point fixed mid-\nlength along the roof. Transition was ensured by attaching a metallic wire (diameter: 0.71mm) \nacross the car width ahead of the roof trailing edge. Measurements under these conditions were \nperformed for speeds within the range U\uf0a5 =  25 m\/s to U\uf0a5 = 40 m\/s. \n \n3.3.2 Unsteady pressure measurements \nIn order to correct any potential amplification, attenuation or phase shift of the unsteady pressure \nsignal within the pneumatic tubing system a direct calibration approach was used to estimate the \ntransfer function of the tubes as a function of frequency and static pressure. A single tube was \nselected and connected to a loudspeaker system driven by a sinusoidal signal both adjustable in \nfrequency and amplitude. Pressure signatures were recorded simultaneously at the entrance of \nthe tube and at the exit of the Scanivalve using a 1 psi differential pressure transducer. The \namplitude of the incoming signal was kept constant and the frequency was varied from 10 to 400 \nHz in steps of 10 Hz. The response of the system was then estimated in terms of amplitude ratio \nand phase.  \nFigure 7a shows the equipment used for this process and Figure 7b the filter characteristic. When \nperforming unsteady pressure measurements, the Scanivalve and wind tunnel reference \ntransducers were connected to a multi-port amplifier and filter, then to a CED 1401  A-D converter \nthat allowed simultaneous recording of both signals. Thereby, each signal could be independently \nfiltered and\/or amplified. Before running the tests, a reference signal was taken at zero wind for \nboth channels. This reference signal was then removed as an offset during data processing. \nThroughout the test range of velocities of U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s \u2013 40 m\/s, the wind tunnel was run \ncontinuously, changing neither the model configuration nor the Scanivalve pressure transducer. \nThe sample rates and transducer calibration constants are listed in table 2. \n \n3.4 PIV Set-up \nPIV images were acquired using a TSI Insight 3D stereoscopic PIV system with two TSI \nPowerview 4MP 12 bit 4 megapixel CCD cameras and a New Wave Solo Nd:YAG double-pulsed \nlaser. Figures 8 and 9 show the basic stereoscopic PIV set-up where the cameras were mounted \n1300mm behind the rear of the model on a pair of 80mm x 120mm rectangular posts, with an \nobject distance of 1400mm corresponding to a camera half angle of 23\no\n. Samples of 200 images \nwere taken for each measurement condition and perspective error [45] eliminated through the use \nof the stereoscopic set-up. The laser was mounted outside the wind tunnel above the model and \nprojected through a small access hole with the light sheet generated using a set of TSI plano \ncylindrical and spherical lenses. This resulted in a diverging light sheet of less than 1mm \nthickness illuminating the plane of interest which had dimensions 190mm x 190mm and which \nwas positioned adjacent to the model centerline as shown in Figure 5. The local flow area in the \nregion of interest was seeded using a Fogger smoke generator producing seeding with a size of \n0.1\uf06dm \u2013 1 \uf06dm. Pulse separations were set to ensure less than 30% particle image movement \nthrough the light sheet. Table 3 below outlines the pulse duration settings. \nPIV images were processed from 200 images using the correlation averaging algorithm [46] \nincorporated into the TSI UltraPIV software. This algorithm has the advantage of yielding velocity \ndata in flows where the seeding quality is highly variable by effectively increasing the signal to \nnoise through the correlation average. A primary correlation window of 64 x 64 pixels was \nselected with a sub-correlation window of 32 x 32 pixels with a Gaussian peak search and a \nvalidation range of \uf0b1U\uf0a5 and 0.5U\uf0a5 gradient tolerance. Where possible, non-valid vectors were \ndeleted and interpolated using valid data within a 5 x 5 averaged matrix. Final results typically \nyielded 5000 vectors per PIV image corresponding to a spatial resolution of around 2.5mm \uf0b4 \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n7 \n2.5mm over the imaging area. Expected measurement errors are better than 2% in plane and 5% \nout of plane of full scale velocity. These maximum errors are based on a correlation error of 0,1 \npixel and 5 pixel full scale particle image displacement and the imaging geometry corresponding \nto a camera half angle of around 25\no\n [47,48]. In regions of high seeding density when the number \nof particle image pairs N is higher, the error in this case would be expected to fall as 1\/\uf0d6N through \nthe correlation averaging [46]. Further information on correlation errors can be found in a review \npaper by the first author [49]. \n \n \n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe following section now describes the results from each measurement technique followed by a \ndiscussion of findings from the different techniques with comparisons to previous quantitative and \nqualitative data. \n \n4.1 Flow visualisation \nThe most useful flow visualisation results were from the tuft visualisation and the surface flow \nvisualisation. These results are outlined in more detail below.  The smoke flow visualisation was \nnot successful because, at the higher wind tunnel speeds, the smoke was found to dissipate \nbefore reaching the bootdeck region. Therefore smoke flow visualization was restricted to the \nspeed range U\uf0a5 = 6m\/s \u2013 18m\/s (Re = 0.74 \uf0b410\n6 \n\u2013 2.22\uf0b410\n6\n) and under these conditions it was \ndifficult to see any coherent structure in the near-wake. \n \n4.1.1 Tuft flow visualisation \nTuft flow visualisation allowed approximate observations to be made of the flow structure in the \nbootdeck area. The three categories of tuft motion seen were: i) tufts remaining aligned with the \nflow indicating attached flow, ii) tufts which curve and move upstream indicating recirculation \nareas iii) tufts having rotating motion indicating areas of unsteady flow. On the basis of these \ncriteria, the videos were analysed for all the speeds assessed. It was observed that for speeds \nbelow U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s, the near-wake structure appeared weak and the tuft motions did not exhibit \nany particular features. However, analysis of the videos from U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s to U\uf0a5 = 40 m\/s led to \nan assessment of the flow field as listed in Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 10. \nGiven these observations, some general comments can be made with respect to the bootdeck \nflow structures. Firstly, that the shear layer appears to reattach onto the bootdeck, as has been \nobserved by previous workers [6]. Secondly, the unsteadiness appears to move from left to right \ndepending on the speed, which indicates that the flow structure may be asymmetric and varying \nwith Reynolds number.   \n \n4.1.2 Surface flow visualisation \nSurface flow visualization was carried out at U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s (Re = 3.09\uf0b410\n6\n) and U\uf0a5 = 40 m\/s (Re = \n4.93\uf0b410\n6\n). To provide adequate drying of the fluorescent flow visualization mixture on the \nsurface, the flow visualisation pictures were taken approximately 9 minutes after the beginning of \neach test. \nResults from the U\uf0a5 = 25 m\/s test are shown in Figure 11a. There are four major flow features of \ninterest at this flow speed. Points 1 indicate the presence of two reattachment nodes at the \ndownstream edge of the hairpin vortex region. The left and right hand sides of these two \nreattachment regions do not appear to have the same corresponding positions along the same \npoint of the bootdeck therefore indicating a degree of flow asymmetry. Points 2 represent two \nunstable focus areas, with their instability partly recognisable by the poor distribution of the \nvisualization material on the surface. These two focus areas are expected to yield two major \ncontra-rotating vortical structures which extend over the bootdeck region as indicated by the \nsurface flow lines extending out from point 1 on each side. Point 3 is unclear due to the poor \nresidual flow visualisation material. However, given the presence of the two adjacent hairpin \nvortices, this point is expected to be a form of saddle point with the flow extending out from the \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n8 \nbacklight and then over the bootdeck region.  Point 4 although not definitive, appears to be near a \nseparation line, probably generated by the interaction of two contra-rotating streamwise vortices \nwhich originate from the hairpin vortices of points 2. Although Figure 8a shows the flow pattern to \nbe asymmetric, the general flow structure seems to correlate well with that proposed by Gilhome \n[6] from his own surface flow visualization (see Figure 1 for comparison). The separation lines \nand saddle point, however, which are just detectable on the left hand side of the model, and \nundetectable on the right hand side, may modify part of the surface flow structure pattern. \nHowever, in general the major structures expected, appear to be visible. \nFigure 11b shows results from the U\uf0a5 = 40m\/s test. As with the previous example, the major \npoints of interest are shown on the image. These results when compared to the U\uf0a5 = 25m\/s test \nappear to have similar flow structures except that the flow structure is a mirror image about the \nmiddle centerline of the lower speed test case with the corresponding positions of the points of \ninterest located on the opposite side of the model. This change in geometry was also noted in the \ntuft flow visualisation results. One other minor difference between the two test cases is also the \npossible presence of a small focus point on the right hand reattachment node point 1. Similar \ndegrees of unsteadiness appear to be present as found in the U\uf0a5 = 25m\/s case based on the \ndistribution of the flow visualization material on the surface. With these limited results, however, it \nis difficult to offer a conclusive explanation for why the flow structure appears to move and why \nvortices change their relative location given that the flow would be expected to be independent of \nReynolds number.  The flow structure in the near wake may be bi-stable, the asymmetry being \ndriven by very small changes in model orientation, or \u2018velocity history\u2019 in terms of the run-up to \nspeed, rather than by a conventional Reynolds number related mechanism. \n \n4.2 Particle Image Velocimetry \nPIV data was recorded from the model over the speed range U\uf0a5 = 20m\/s \u2013 30m\/s with 200 image \npairs per run. Time-averaged vector maps could only be generated from the PIV images as \nsufficient seeding levels could not be obtained for satisfactory full-field instantaneous PIV data. \nThe low seeding levels therefore led to the use of the correlation averaging routine to yield full \nfield time-averaged data for all the flow cases studied. \nFigures 12 and 13 show the 3D stereoscopic PIV vector maps. In this case the out in-plane \ncomponents u and v are represented by the vector map with additional large scale arrows to \nclarify general flow structure. The out of plane component w is represented by the colour contour \nplots superimposed onto the vector plots. In this case red represents velocity in the freestream \ndirection, green stationary flow and blue reversed flow. \nFigure 12 shows 3D vector plots for three lateral planes between the backlight and the rear boot \n(see Figure 6) at a free stream velocity of 30m\/s. All three plots show the dominance of the \nfreestream component on the data with out-of-plane velocities of the order of 30m\/s covering the \nmajority of the measurement plane. At the mid-boot position (Figure 12b), flow structure leading \nto possible flow separation is visible to the left hand side of the flow field through lower w \ncomponent velocities and the modified in-plane flow structure. However the flow has not reversed \nat this point which would be definitive of full flow separation. The remaining lower velocity regions \nadjacent to backlight surface are attributed to reflections off the model surface causing a poor \nsignal to noise ratio and resultant large errors. These reflective effects were reduced by painting \nthe model surface matt black, but were never completely eliminated. In the rear-boot plane, the \nfreestream component is still dominant but over a smaller area as it appears that separation \neffects, in terms of the expected hairpin and rear-pillar vortices, become established over the boot \nregion. Therefore with reference to Figure 1, it is likely that the PIV measurement planes have \nbeen positioned adjacent either the hairpin or rear-pillar recirculation structures. This result thus \ninfers that if present the hairpin vortex would be positioned less than x\/L<0.04 and the rear-pillar \nvortex at x\/L>0.15 at the rear-boot region. Further stereoscopic measurements either side of the \ncurrent region of interest would be required to confirm this finding. \nFigure 13 shows 3D PIV time-averaged data from one plane of interest at the end-boot position \ntaken at three different velocities to investigate the effect of changes in Reynolds number on the \nflow structures over the car. The results were taken at wind speeds between 20m\/s \u2013 30m\/s \ncorresponding to Reynolds numbers ranging from 2.47 \uf0b4 10\n6 \n\u2013 3.69 \uf0b4 10\n6\n.  Initial inspection of the \nresults shows the dominance of the freestream component in all three cases through the majority \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n9 \nof the area of interest. There also appears to be little effect of Reynolds number on the overall \nflow structure. In all three cases, there is also a greater horizontal component of flow structure for \nx\/L > 0.1 which may be attributed to the effect of the rear-pillar vortex adjacent to the PIV regions \nof interest. In all three cases, however, the dominant velocity component is clearly the freestream \n(w) direction which also indicates this region of interest is less affected by any adjacent \nseparation structures. It should be noted that this Reynolds number insensitivity contradicts a \nnumber of the findings of the flow visualization studies, but actually reinforces findings of the \nstatic pressure studies outlined in the following section.  Also these tests were undertaken during \na different test phase to that of the flow visualization and as a result minor changes in model \norientation cannot be ruled out.  If the flow were to be particularly sensitive to such changes this \nmay explain the differences. \n \n \n4.3 Static pressure measurements \nThe static pressure measurements can be broken down into two parts. These are the steady and \nunsteady pressure measurements. These results will now be outlined in more detail. \n4.3.1 Steady static pressure measurements \nFigures 14a, 14b and 14c show the steady static pressure coefficient (cp) measurements at the \nbacklight, mid-boot and end-boot z measurement planes for freestream velocities between U\uf0a5 = \n25m\/s \u2013 40m\/s. The results show the flow to be initially almost symmetrical in the x profile in the \nbacklight region, but the profiles becoming more distorted towards the rear of the car in the mid-\nboot and end-boot regions. The cp data also becomes more positive in the central region towards \nthe rear of the bootdeck which indicates velocities lower than freestream in the hairpin vortex and \nfreestream vortex regions. Also towards the side of the bootdeck, the cp level drops indicating \nacceleration of the flow in the rear-pillar vortex region in the end-boot region decreasing from cp = \n-0.17 to cp = -0.22. \nThe distorted cp characteristic in the rear-boot unfortunately contradicts the general findings of the \nsurface flow visualisation which found an asymmetrical pattern on the surface in this backlight \nregion. However, there was also an additional contradiction between these results as the steady \ncp pressure data shows minimal sensitivity to Reynolds number over the range of flow speeds \nwith little change in the distorted cp distribution. This is in contrast to the flow visualisation data \nwhich indicates changes in the backlight flow structure between the two test cases of U\uf0a5 = 25m\/s \nand U\uf0a5 = 40m\/s.  \n4.3.2 Unsteady static pressure measurements \nFigure 15 shows the rms cp unsteady pressure distributions at the backlight, mid-boot and end-\nboot z measurement planes for freestream velocities between U\uf0a5 = 25m\/s \u2013 40m\/s. The general \ntrend in all three measurement planes show increased unsteadiness towards the edges of the \nbootdeck. This would be expected as these regions correspond to the rear-pillar vortex flow \nstructures which will be highly turbulent. There is also a significant fall in the rms cp towards the \ncentre of the bootdeck particularly at the mid-bootdeck region. This indicates that the flow \nbecomes more stable as it develops over the bootdeck and leaves the rear of the model. \nConsideration of the effect of Reynolds number results in the following observations. Generally \nover the range of Reynolds number tested, between Re = 3.08\uf0b410\n6\n \u2013 4.93\uf0b410\n6\n, there was no \nobvious change in the overall level of cp fluctuations, particularly in the backlight region. This \nresult was reinforced by the spectral results of selected pressure tappings where there appeared \nto be no dominant modes at any of the planes through the range of Reynolds numbers tested. A \ntypical example of these broadband characteristics can be seen in Figure 16 which shows \nspectral data at the end-boot centreline position at 40m\/s. Further examination of the spectra at \ndifferent positions and conditions also gave similar findings for Reynolds number insensitivity. \nThis result confirms findings from the PIV data and rms pressure data.  \n \n \n \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n10 \n5 CONCLUSIONS \n \nFlow visualisation, PIV and static pressure results have been presented from wind tunnel studies \nof the bootdeck region of a 36% scale model of a notchback saloon car. The flow visualisation \nresults have indicated flow asymmetries in the backlight region which appear to be sensitive to \nchanges in freestream speed. These asymmetries are likely to originate from two unstable focus \npoints either side of the backlight with a bi-stable near wake flow structure which is particularly \nsensitive to external factors within this Reynolds number range. In contrast, further investigation \nof the flow in the rear bootdeck area during a subsequent test programme with stereoscopic PIV \nsuggested little or no sensitivity of the flow structure to Reynolds number. The 3D PIV time-\naveraged data also seems to have been positioned between hairpin and rear-pillar vortex \nstructures as no significant flow features were found from this data. Thus the rear-pillar and \nhairpin vortex structures are expected to be positioned at x\/L<0.04 and x\/L>0.15 respectively. \nSteady and unsteady static pressure data also showed a Reynolds number insensitive flow \nstructure from the backlight to the rear bootdeck area with a nearly symmetric cp profile at the \nrear of the car. In addition unsteady measurements showed no dominant frequency to exist \nthrough the range of Reynolds numbers and bootdeck positions tested. Discrepancies between \nthe flow visualisation and the other flow data can be in part attributed to difficulty in interpreting \nthe flow visualisation in the backlight region. Further work is now planned using 3D stereoscopic \ntime-resolved PIV (TR-PIV) over the centreline and boot edge regions to confirm the presence of \nthe hairpin and rear-pillar structures and ascertain any unsteady characteristics or Reynolds \nnumber sensitivity in these regions. Such a study will require significant improvements to the \nseeding levels introduced into the flow region of interest. \n \n  \nJournal of Automotive Engineering \n \n11 \nREFERENCES \n1. Katz, J.
