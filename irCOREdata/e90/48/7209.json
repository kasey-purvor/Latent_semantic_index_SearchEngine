(Campbell, 2003, p. 35)\nIntroduction\nThis quote from the book Reusing Learning Objects: A Sustainable Approach to E-learning\n(Littlejohn, 2003) describes the current state of progress with integration of digital\nlearning objects into academic practice. Uptake of these resources is happening at a\nslower than desirable pace, despite the unquestionable quality of design and produc-\ntion, high levels of investment in professional development and the rationally antici-\npated outcome of this investment. The concept of reusability is not specific to digital\nobjects as the widespread acceptance of resources such as textbooks, videos and educa-\ntional software shows. The challenge of finding a route to widespread acceptance and\nreuse of digital learning objects is the focus of much attention in the current higher\neducation context. This paper presents an alternative perspective on the concept of\nreusability that has so far received relatively little consideration. It may, in fact, be more\naccurately described as repurposing. It is based on the perfectly reasonable assumption\n*Corresponding author. Cathy Gunn, Centre for Professional Development, The University of\nAuckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand. Email: ca.gunn@auckland.ac.nz\n190 C. Gunn et al.\nthat teachers need to develop new and contextually appropriate instructional strategies\nfor a learner-centric design model that is commonly associated with e-learning and\nthe use of digital learning objects. Success depends on a relationship-based learning\nmodel where advances in knowledge are recognized as the product of combined objec-\ntive and subjective elements. In this case, the objective element is information about\nlearning objects as a generic concept. The subjective aspect is each individual teacher\u2019s\nemergent conceptual model of how learning objects can be integrated into an existing\nrepertoire of discipline-based knowledge and teaching skills. The perceived benefits\nof developing new teaching strategies have to justify the investment of time and\nresources for such initiatives to be undertaken. In the case of digital learning objects,\nthe discourse of objectivism and commodification surrounding their development is\nproving counter-productive to even conceptual acceptance of reusability. Grand-scale\npredictions followed by spectacular underachievement of profit-driven e-learning\norganizations, together with the association of e-learning with the failed \u2018dot.com\neconomy\u2019, is enough to convince many observers that the learning object economy is\njust another passing fad.\nA recently published report, \u2018Thwarted innovation: what happened to e-learning\nand why?\u2019 (Zemsky & Massy, 2004), represents the voice of reason in saying that, now\nthe initial euphoria has worn off, the true potential of e-learning and digital learning\nobjects can begin to be realized. Those with experience in the field know that the\ncombination of technology and pedagogy offers powerful potential to enhance\nstudent learning. What seems to be missing at this stage of the innovation cycle is the\nkey that will allow a critical mass of teachers to unlock that potential. This article in\nno way seeks to denigrate other initiatives designed to meet this challenge. Rather, it\npresents a complementary approach that could move learning object reuse on to a\nhigher level of acceptance.\nA sustainable approach to reusability\nA sustainable approach to reusability involves teachers in a participative design\nprocess that results in a sense of ownership, acceptance and ability to realize the\npotential of technology in different contexts. Underlying assumptions differ consid-\nerably from the \u2018course design as assembly of autonomous components\u2019 approach\nthat has so far failed to achieve anticipated economic and educational objectives\n(Priest & Quaife-Ryan, 2004). This difference may be critical if the goal is to move\nbeyond the use of learning objects as supplementary materials within the context of\nlong-established teaching models.\nIt may be pertinent to note that the accepted wisdom of developers of new technol-\nogy rarely prove capable of making reliable predictions about its eventual use, (see for\nexample, Burbules & Callister, 2000). It is only when the intended (and sometimes\nunanticipated) end users of technology add their requirements, experience and\nprofessional practice that mainstream integration is achieved. The original technol-\nogy \u2018object\u2019 remains the designer\u2019s creation, but the different \u2018versions\u2019 and uses that\ninvariably emerge are developed by end users. If this is indeed the case, then the exact\nRepurposing learning objects 191\nspecification defined by learning object designers may not be suitable for all end users\nand customization may be required. Continuing this line of argument, it may be the\nstructure or the content of a learning object that ultimately proves to be the reusable\naspect. The majority of promotional activities to date have focused on reuse of\ncomplete objects with a fixed combination of structure, content and technical\nelements. While the value of this approach is not disputed, critical issues of deep,\nconceptual understanding, a sense of ownership and wider issues of cultural assimi-\nlation remain unresolved. These issues alone can determine the success or failure of\neducational innovations, regardless of technical robustness, accessibility and quality\nof content. The case presented here is that fully supported opportunities for teachers\nto \u2018repurpose\u2019 object structures through a participative design process is the path\nmost likely to lead to the elusive goal of reuse of digital learning objects by a critical\nmass of teachers. Repurposing is defined as a process where the original structure of\na learning object is populated with content from a different source and\/or subject area\nand used to develop new learning activities.\nDefining learning objects\nMany definitions of reusable learning objects exist. A commonly accepted one is: \nAny digital resource capable of reciprocal action that can be reused to support learning.\nThis definition combines key elements identified in two published sources. Wiley\n(2000, p. 4) offers a description that is at once simple, flexible and comprehensive: \nAny digital resource that can be reused to support learning.\nNichols (2002, p. 2) adds the critical dimensions of student input and system\nreciprocity. \nLearning objects are simulations or learning activities that are responsive to student input,\nthat is, the objects provide some level of reciprocity and encourage constructivist forms of\nlearning.\nThe reference to reciprocal action is key to focusing on learning as opposed to teach-\ning objects. While this is not a commonly drawn distinction, these authors agree that\nit is an important one. \nTeaching objects are primarily presentation based, but may use multiple media; such\nobjects are not interactive in a reciprocal sense (i.e. they do not meaningfully respond to\ndecisions made by the student) and have a cognitive bent. (Nichols, 2002, p. 2)\nMost focus to date has been on making content available (teaching objects) rather\nthan preparing interactive exercises (learning objects). This highlights the difference\nbetween teacher-centred and student-centred activity and a common misconception\nabout effective e-learning; that is, that presentation of content in digital format is the\nultimate goal, rather than student learning through active engagement with respon-\nsive online systems that may (or may not) include multimedia features. Some defini-\ntions of learning objects appear to support this misconception, and part of the reason\n192 C. Gunn et al.\nfor low levels of uptake may stem from the perception that learning objects are simply\ncontent material converted to a different format (e.g. from print to multimedia). The\ndifference this makes to student learning is unlikely to justify major investment or to\nvisibly support early adopters\u2019 claims of an emergent educational paradigm. In these\ncircumstances, even the initial stages of Hurley\u2019s (1992) model of acceptance of new\ntechnology in organizations, (illustrated in the following diagram) (i.e. perceived\nusefulness and early participative involvement) may not be reached, or followed by\nthe later stages of trials, acceptance and use.\nAnother risk noted by Hurley is: \n\u2026 many examples exist where the central concept of acceptance appears to be studiously\nignored, while somewhat peripheral concepts of a highly disparate nature are explored with\ngreat thoroughness. (Hurley, 1992, p. 29)\nIn the case of learning objects, debates about granularity, the relative merits of\ndifferent technical specifications and architectural models continue. As noted by\nCampbell (2003), these are critical conditions for the successful development of the\nlearning object economy. However, they are not the key factors that integration of\nlearning objects into teaching practice depends on. If they were, the current \u2018low\nacceptance dilemma\u2019 would not be faced because solutions would already be well\ndeveloped. Since matters of definition and technical description are peripheral to the\ncase presented, no further discussion is included. These issues are addressed else-\nwhere in more detail (see for example, Wiley, 2000).\nWhy reusable objects are not reused\nInvestigations of the \u2018slow adoption\u2019 phenomenon have appeared in the literature for\nover a decade, with many reasons proposed and potential remedies tested. The\nunderlying technology was somewhat different in the scenarios described by Gard-\nner & Darby (1990), Darby (1992a & b), Hammond et al. (1992), Hodas (1996)\nand Taylor (1998), but the nature of the challenge was the same\u2014that the antici-\npated rate of integration of computer-supported learning had failed to materialize.\nInvestment in production, dissemination and professional development did not\nsucceed in removing the barriers to uptake. In the case of reusable learning objects,\nthe literature describes a complex list of issues and the means through which the\nbarriers they create are addressed, including: \n\u25cf Interoperability and cataloguing standards (for example, Wilson, 2001).\n\u25cf Quality control for content (for example, Taylor & Richardson, 2001).\n\u25cf Inclusion of pedagogical frameworks (for example, Boyle & Cook, 2001).\n\u25cf Targeted professional development for teachers (for example, Littlejohn, 2003).\nGiven the relative success of these initiatives and the paradox of variable impact of\nsuch targeted investment, the question that follows is whether some fundamental\nlimitation is imposed by current conceptions of the problem and the scope of\nproposed solutions.\nRepurposing learning objects 193\nConditions for acceptance of new technology\nBefore focusing on the case of digital learning objects, acceptance of new technology\nin organizations is considered for two reasons. Firstly it situates the learning objects\ndilemma in the broader field of organizational change (Fullan, 2001). Secondly it\nidentifies generic influences in the specific context. While the models of authors such\nas Zemsky and Massy (2004) describe cycles of technology adoption, they do not\nidentify influential factors at various stages. For this purpose, a different model is\nuseful.\nHurley (1992) presents a psychological model for the acceptance of new technol-\nogy, and notes that introduction rather than acceptance of new technology provides\nthe focus for the bulk of research studies. Contemporary organizational theory\nsupports Hurley\u2019s argument that rationalist viewpoints do not reflect the reality of\nchange, where political, cultural and personal factors are as influential as manage-\nment initiatives and strategic plans. The model is a simple, sequential one, shown in\nFigure 1. Details of the stages matter less to this case than the sequence of events and\ncyclical nature of the process.\nFigure 1. Process model of the introduction of new technologyThe process may be uniform during the first three stages as early adopters move\nthrough the conceptual, experimental and trial phases. The next three stages are\nknown to be met with varied levels of enthusiasm by different stakeholders and may\ntake considerably longer. The final phase is subject to financial, political and cultural\npressures that may bear little or no direct relationship to the merit of the new tech-\nnology itself, so the issues are complex. The case study presented in this paper does\nnot address these final stage complexities, although exclusion does not imply insignif-\nicance. The aim is simply to present an alternative way for the potential of technology,\nin this case learning objects, to be realized through teacher involvement in design.\nFigure 1. Process model of the introduction of new technology\n194 C. Gunn et al.\nParticipation and change\nUser participation in system design is beneficial for two reasons. System design is more\nlikely to reflect specific user needs, and acceptance is easier when a sense of ownership\nevolves during the development phase. The \u2018not invented here syndrome\u2019 reported in\nthe computer assisted learning literature of the 1990s describes many situations where\npedagogically sound, technically robust and usable programmes were developed\nunder government-funded initiatives such as TLTP (UK), and AUTC (Australia).\nThe outcome was, in one important respect, similar to the current experience. \nDespite coordinated efforts such as these to promote the effective use of computers in\nteaching, the uptake is not as high as many have hoped. (Hammond et al., 1992, p. 155)\nThe need for a conceptual shift is key to acceptance of learning objects that are\ndeveloped by third parties. Downes\u2019 (2001) report \u2018Learning objects: resources for\ndistance education worldwide\u2019 raises the point that, logically, the world does not need\nthousands of similar objects addressing basic educational concepts when one, or at\nmost a dozen, would meet the needs of all learners. The economic argument for\nlimited production is compelling, yet the reinvention process continues because this\nis the culturally familiar pattern of teacher behaviour repeating itself in the digital age.\nThe perceived threat to teacher status that this poses is an obvious barrier to accep-\ntance, and the limitations of the argument may be lost on inexperienced users or late\nadopters of technology-facilitated learning. Experienced users know that technology\nopens up creative opportunities to apply existing expertise to the challenges posed by\nthe changing educational context.\nSo if logic and economics are not the determining factors, what does the reusability\ndecision hinge on for individual academics? Further analysis of this question is possi-\nble without resorting to speculation. Using the example of resources that are\nfrequently reused (i.e. textbooks, maps, software programs, graphics and videos),\nsome common factors can be identified. One is that they are produced centrally and\ndistributed widely by established publishers. Perhaps more importantly, the shared\nresources are used in parts rather than in entirety, and integrated into a wide variety\nof learning activities. While the learning objects themselves may be standard, the\nrange of possible uses is far from uniform. It seems entirely feasible to suggest that\ndigital objects could be used in similar ways; the key points being that teachers have\nsound conceptual models of what these reusable materials are, the extent of their\nperformance and creative potential for combination and reuse for different purposes.\nSometimes teachers are also authors, but in all cases the conceptual models are more\nor less complete. Most importantly, the objects neither depend on nor dictate the use\nof any particular teaching style or strategy, thus allowing teachers the freedom to\nimplement their own.\nDesign and participation\nThe case now presented demonstrates how participation in the design phase of a\nrepurposing process can provide a direct route through acceptance to organizational\nRepurposing learning objects 195\nchange and development. The conclusion is that one highly effective way to get learn-\ning object reuse into the repertoire of teachers is through the role of a collaborative\ndeveloper. It may not be practical for every teacher to develop the technical skills to\nproduce learning objects from scratch. However, working collaboratively with the\nstructure of an existing object, populating it with familiar content and embedding it\nwithin self-defined learning activities results in many benefits: \n\u25cf Production of a useful teaching resource.\n\u25cf Knowledge of production processes.\n\u25cf A sense of ownership.\n\u25cf Confidence to use the learning object in a variety of appropriate situations.\n\u25cf An increased level of knowledge of the synergies that result from bringing together\ntechnology, instructional design and teaching expertise.\nAssuming the success of such a venture and a positive impact on student learning,\nit is reasonable to expect that progress through all stages of the acceptance model will\nresult. If roles then shift, as they frequently do, the newly competent reusable learning\nobject user may become a mentor for others, as initial evidence points to these skills\nbeing transferable.\nSkills for reuse\nConsider the case of a teacher using an existing learning object structure to develop\nresources to support learning within their own subject. Pedagogical content knowl-\nedge (Barnett & Hodson, 2001) and instructional design skills already exist within the\nteacher\u2019s repertoire. These are necessary, although insufficient, conditions for effec-\ntive use of learning objects. Knowledge of how technology can complement these\nskills must be added. In the process of repurposing an existing object structure, teach-\ners develop conceptual understanding of the particular object as well as the generic\nconcept of learning objects. If instead they choose to reuse an existing object, they\nmight learn about its description in a cataloguing system, the content that is included\nand pedagogical contexts for use. It is unlikely, however, that they would be able to\nconstruct their own objects or to repopulate object structures as a result of this expe-\nrience. Participative design puts the learning object structure and functionality in\nfocus during the teacher\u2019s situated learning experience. Some evidence emerged from\nthe case study, described in this paper, to suggest that this experience promoted a\nreview of other aspects of learning activity design such as logical flow, being concise\nand tightly structured. The distinction between reuse and repurposing may appear\nsubtle in some respects, while the outcomes differ significantly. One leads to accep-\ntance and enhanced instructional design skill, the other to increased awareness of\navailable resources and the ability to use a range of presentation techniques.\nWhile participative design requires a period of intensive support from the devel-\noper, an education technologist or an instructional designer familiar with the object\nstructure, the investment is justified by the outcomes. The relative neglect of a partic-\nipative approach to reusability represents a significant remaining barrier to uptake.\n196 C. Gunn et al.\nThe potential success of this approach is illustrated through a collaborative venture\nbetween lecturers in chemistry and in accounting information systems (AIS).\nCase study: a problem in AIS and application to a reusable chemistry tutorial \nsystem\nThis case study reflects a fairly typical scenario where an academic with some working\nknowledge of e-learning was motivated to seek a technology-based solution to a\nstudent learning problem. The challenge facing AIS learners was an apparent inability\nto translate narratives on design and interpretation of data flow diagrams into visual\nrepresentations (i.e. diagram components) and appropriate structural combinations\n(i.e. complete functional diagrams). These skills cannot be rote learned for a number\nof reasons, and students have to reach a higher level of competence than what seemed\nto be possible in the limited contact time available. They need to understand the\nconcept at a general level of abstraction rather than in specific detail, and experience\nshows experiential learning is effective. Devoting additional time to this basic topic\nwould compromise overall progress, yet students clearly need more frequent engage-\nment and timely constructive feedback than is provided in class. The teacher had the\ncontent for a learning object more or less mapped out and knew in principle that tech-\nnology was capable of supporting a solution that would allow students to build and\nreinforce knowledge through repeated interaction. What she lacked was specific\nknowledge of how to implement that solution.\nThe solution to the AIS problem emerged during a meeting with a highly experi-\nenced chemistry lecturer who had developed the BestChoice interactive tutorial\nsystem (http:\/\/130.216.56.150\/). This teacher had considerable experience of devel-\noping computer-based learning activities gained through over 10 years of practice.\nBestChoice is a database-driven system in which different types of feedback are a key\nfeature: \n\u25cf Users receive immediate feedback commensurate with their responses to a range\nof tutorial questions.\n\u25cf Users can easily give context sensitive feedback to assist with system improve-\nments.\n\u25cf System log data provides aggregate and individual performance data to inform\nrevision and further development.\nThe chemistry teacher has remained at the leading edge of science education meth-\nods and sought solutions to numerous learner challenges through additions and\nextensions to the BestChoice system. Many refinements were based on suggestions\nfrom student users. Thus the database structure not only supports student engage-\nment with the content, but is also a repository of data on user interactions and\ncomments.\nSome readers might argue that BestChoice is not a learning object because it is too\nlarge and complex to fit standard definitions, or because it does not include metadata\ndescribing the content or pedagogical contexts for use. However, the developer has\nRepurposing learning objects 197\nalways considered it to be a learning object, it fits the definition used in this paper and\nthat definition is derived from other published sources. Regardless of its acceptance,\nsuccessful articulation of the concept of reusability is demonstrated. The process now\ndescribed has already proved to be sustainable and successful in ways that other reus-\nability initiatives have not. The difference lies in the participative approach to repur-\nposing rather than simple reuse of learning objects.\nRepurposing a learning object\nThe collaboration began following a presentation by the BestChoice designer. She\nconfirmed that the conceptual solution developed for the AIS students fell within the\ncapability of the existing system. For the activities, five sets of exercises designed to\nsupport incremental development of diagramming skills translated into 25 interactive\nweb pages with short narratives accompanying graphical representations of the tasks\nfor students to complete. Constructive feedback was written for both correct and\nincorrect responses, as a \u2018scaffolded\u2019 approach is preferred. Content submitted by the\nAIS teacher was translated into web format by the BestChoice developer, who judged\nthat the system\u2019s resident web editor would be too complicated for the novice AIS\nuser to work with independently. Ongoing dialogue over a period of four weeks\nsupported development and later refinement of the online tasks. Specific design\nfeatures were negotiated, with the tasks easily structured to fit into the extensive range\nof question types provided by BestChoice. No compromise of planned activity design\nproved necessary. A \u2018trial and error\u2019 (heuristic) approach was the common language\nof negotiation and both parties developed deeper understanding of the system. The\nAIS teacher learned about functionality, structure and capability. The BestChoice\ndeveloper learned how to repurpose the structure for use in different subject areas and\nlearning designs. Perhaps the hardest part for the AIS teacher was developing deep\nconceptual understanding of the database structure behind the system; that is, of the\ntechnology that supports the pedagogy. However, the ability to derive that under-\nstanding from direct experience of developing a version of the system in the meaning-\nful context of her own teaching practice did much to facilitate the learning process.\nAfter one participative venture, she felt confident enough to work independently with\nthe BestChoice web editor and development tools, and competent to do so with her\nnewly developed understanding of the technology. The BestChoice developer\u2019s\nteaching expertise allowed her to gauge how her collaborator\u2019s understanding\nprogressed, how best to support this and take it to the next stage. It is probable that\nthe developer\u2019s own incrementally acquired understanding informed her actions in\nthis respect.\nTo summarize the outcomes of the collaboration, instructional design, technical\nexpertise and intimate knowledge of student behaviour with interactive systems\ncontributed by the BestChoice developer complemented the pedagogical content\nknowledge of the subject expert to successfully repurpose the learning object for use\nin another disciplinary context. The structural elements used for chemistry applied\nequally well to content and learning activities for AIS. The setting in which this\n198 C. Gunn et al.\ninitiative took place is typical of the contemporary university context; that is, charac-\nterized by increasing class size and diversity, financial constraints and limited\nresources for teaching. The methodological shift towards focus on learning rather\nthan teaching makes the case for repurposing learning objects (or systems) in this\nmanner compelling.\nDiscussion\nThe participative design approach described in this paper addresses critical issues of\ndeep conceptual understanding of the role and scope, as well as acceptance and\nownership, of reusable learning objects. The long-term goal of educational culture\nchange, which is the final stage of the technology acceptance model, begins to be\naddressed with the repurposing model. The prospect of achieving similar degrees of\nsuccess with teacher professional development and sustainable impact is less certain\nwith other initiatives such as learning object repositories, dissemination or generic\nstaff development programmes. Such initiatives generally do increase knowledge and\npromote positive moves along the acceptance continuum. However, the overall\nimpact is less significant than when the repurposing approach is applied. Similarly,\nthe removal of technical barriers, establishment of interoperability standards, meta-\ndata and cataloguing systems are positive dimensions of accessibility. However, they\nare not sufficient in themselves to drive the academic culture change that is needed\nto promote the emergent learner-centred education model that uses learning objects\nas a core resource. Nor are they likely to do so on the same scale as the \u2018participative\ndesign in repurposing\u2019 model. For this shift to occur, the conceptual models of curric-\nulum developers and teachers need to embrace the concept of reusability in a mean-\ningful way. This implies a sense of ownership through participation in design and\ndevelopment as well as the ability to drive innovation to new levels. Like any other\nconceptual development, there is no easy route to achievement of this high level of\nproficiency, as the case study illustrates.\nThe AIS lecturer began as a novice with the concepts of learning object design and\nreuse. After four weeks of intensive collaborative work to repurpose a learning object\nstructure for use within her own subject area, she was capable of producing fully inter-\nactive online activities independently of her mentor. She had also analyzed student\nlearning and reviewed her teaching strategies in a detailed way. This in-depth analysis\nresulted from the need to express the principles underlying her teaching practice and\nto translate them into online learning activities using digital media format. She is now\ncompetent to apply this enhanced conceptual understanding to the development of\nlearning objects in other topic areas. She is also in a position to share the AIS learning\nobject and her experience of participative development with colleagues in her depart-\nment, and perhaps to drive future developments of similar nature. This level of ability\ncould not be achieved by other means, particularly within the period of 15 working\ndays of the repurposing initiative.\nThe learning object structure originally designed for interactive chemistry tutorials\nhas proved to be reusable in different subjects. The development of BestChoice\nRepurposing learning objects 199\ninvolved considerable effort, resource commitment and a steep learning curve.\nHowever, the resultant benefits to students, staff and the e-learning community are\nsignificant. In future, these benefits will extend to the international AIS community,\nas the diagramming object will be added to a shared resource collection that is\ncurrently under development. An existing AIS community of practice provides the\nmeans for dissemination. It is the nature of communities of practice to self-generate\nand perpetuate. Perhaps the lesson here is that the learning object economy will\ndevelop through the same means rather than being driven by the architects of the\noriginal technology.\nTo teachers who fear an \u2018identity crisis\u2019 caused by e-learning \u2018commodification\u2019,\nthe repurposing concept may bring a sense of relief. Professional expertise is a critical\npart of the innovation process and different teaching styles an integral part of the\nlearning environments that reusable learning objects can be designed for and inte-\ngrated into. As to what the \u2018dominant design\u2019 for learning objects or courses that\nincorporate them will be, if such a design emerges, as the literature on innovation\ncycles suggests it must, the teachers involved in repurposing initiatives are best placed\nto contribute to its definition.\nReferences\nBarnett, J. & Hodson, D.
