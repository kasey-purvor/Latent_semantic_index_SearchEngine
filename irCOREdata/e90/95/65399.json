Introduction\n[2] A basic hydraulic property of overland flow is mean\nvelocity and many hydrological and hydraulic models\nrequire a velocity component for flow. This is the case both\nfor overland flow and channel flow [e.g., Beven and Kirkby,\n1979; Refsgaard and Storm, 1995]. An understanding of the\nhydraulics of shallow overland flows is required for mod-\neling runoff and erosion [Dunne and Dietrich, 1980; Roels,\n1984; Nearing et al., 1999; Dunkerley, 2003] which in turn\nmay aid understanding of the effects of management inter-\nventions designed to slow or reduce the rapid delivery of\nrunoff and sediment to the drainage network. The presence\nof vegetation further complicates prediction of overland\nflow velocity. It is likely that, in any given study area,\ndifferent vegetation covers and slopes result in spatially\ncomplex patterns of flow velocity, thereby affecting runoff\nproduction and sediment entrainment. Little is known about\nsuch topographical and ecological interactions. Further-\nmore, in studies of the effects of land cover and land\nmanagement on runoff, most emphasis has been upon\ninfiltration rather than the ways in which land cover or\nmanagement alter the connectivity of runoff to the drainage\nnetwork. However, if we are to understand the impacts of\nland management decision making at the catchment scale\nthen the effects of connectivity upon the timing of runoff\ndelivery must be understood at the catchment scale [Lane et\nal., 2007]. This requires us to determine how long it takes\nsource areas of overland flow to connect with the drainage\nnetwork, and the aim of this paper is to present the first\nempirical evidence that allows us to model the relationship\nbetween vegetation cover and flow velocity on peatland\nslopes.\n2. Overland Flows in Peatlands Compared\nWith Other Environments\n[3] In temperate blanket peatlands, up to 80% of the\nwater movement across hillslopes can be produced as\nsaturation-excess overland flow [Holden, 2006; Holden\nand Burt, 2003a, 2003b, 2002; Evans et al., 1999]. Often,\noverland flow on these peats can be greater than 1 cm deep,\nparticularly on long, gently sloping hillslopes that are\ncommon in moorland environments [Holden and Burt,\n2002; Evans et al., 1999], although maximum flow depths\nare generally much lower than those typical of channels.\nOverland flow on peatlands tends to have two components:\na rapid component associated with larger water levels and a\nslower but significant flux through the upper litter layer.\nPeatland slopes can vary from zero to approximately 60%.\nThe vegetation cover on blanket peatlands is often domi-\n1School of Geography, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.\n2Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n3School of Earth Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, Well-\nington, New Zealand.\n4Jacobs Consulting, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/08\/2007WR006052$09.00\nW06415\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 44, W06415, doi:10.1029\/2007WR006052, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1 of 11\nnated by Sphagnum mosses which do not have obvious\nstems, rather they have an intricate branching structure and\nare devoid of roots (Figure 1). The interaction of blanket\npeatland vegetation types and overland flow travel times\nhas, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, hitherto never been\nreported.\n[4] Unlike peatland flows, there has been a long history\nof research into vegetation impacts on both channel and\nfloodplain flow, commonly where the bed slope is less than\n1% [e.g., Freeman et al., 2000; Ja\u00a8rvela\u00a8, 2004; Nepf et al.,\n2007; Nepf, 1999; Leonard and Luther, 1995; Lane and\nHardy, 2002]. Many of these studies have flow depths\nsufficient to allow determination of vertical velocity profiles\nin relation to plant structure and flow interactions [e.g.,\nWilson and Horritt, 2002; Nepf and Koch, 1999; Nepf and\nVivoni, 2000; Ghisalberti and Nepf, 2002; Lightbody and\nNepf, 2006] and the bending of plant stems in the flow\n[Copeland, 2000]. Green [2005] reviews attempts to model\nflow resistance in vegetated streams and Lane and Hardy\n[2002] also review floodplain flow approaches. It is not\nclear how, if at all, the results from these studies transfer to\nthe question of overland flow and furthermore many\npublished studies deal with larger aquatic plants, particularly\nwoody plants that have large diameter stems protruding into\nthe flow and which are frequently modeled as cylinder\nfields. There have been several attempts to study resistance\nlaws for channels with more flexible aquatic vegetation [e.g.,\nKouwen and Fathi-Moghadam, 2000]. Many approaches\nhave been developed that simply try to fit Manning or\nDarcy-Weisbach type formulae to the case in question,\nalthough more recently physically based approaches have\nbeen presented [e.g., Freeman et al., 2000; Nepf et al.,\n2007; Lane and Hardy, 2002] including attempts to incor-\nporate bending stems [Copeland, 2000]. In addition to\nriver and floodplain environments, work has also explored\nsalt marsh flow-vegetation interactions [e.g., French and\nStoddard, 1992] and wetland flows [Nepf, 1999; Nepf et\nal., 2007]. Even where vegetated, rivers, floodplains, wet-\nlands and salt marshes differ from the hillslope flows\ncommonly found in peatlands because they all have a\nslope that rarely exceeds 1% and, under certain scenarios,\ndeeper water levels.\n[5] Since flows are so shallow, there is reduced likelihood\nof vegetation stems bending in the flow [Copeland, 2000].\nThe vegetation and soil structure are also quite different\nfrom the salt marshes and floodplain wetland environments\nthat have been commonly studied in the flow resistance\nliterature [see Ingram, 1983]. Peat soils tend to have an\nupper porous layer known as the \u2018\u2018acrotelm\u2019\u2019 that allows\nshallow subsurface flow to occur at rapid rates at the same\ntime as saturation-excess overland flow [Holden and Burt,\n2003a].\n[6] There is some work that is relevant to the study of the\noverland flows on hillslopes [e.g., Emmett, 1970], but these\nstudies have often been limited to very shallow overland\nflows of the order of a few millimeters in depth [e.g.,\nDunkerley et al., 2001; Kuhn and Bryan, 2003] with a\nparticular emphasis on semiarid environments. These differ\nfrom peatlands because (1) they have a much lower per-\ncentage vegetation cover; (2) they are generally associated\nwith infiltration-excess overland flow, where flow paths are\nshorter as they can only be sustained as long as rainfall\nintensity plus run-on from upstream exceed local infiltration\ncapacity; and (3) they commonly have been managed in\nvery different ways. For instance, some semiarid environ-\nments, especially in southern Europe, have been managed to\nretain runoff for agriculture. In some temperate environ-\nments, the peatlands have been drained to allow more\nefficient runoff. These open land drains (ditches), some-\ntimes of high density [e.g., Holden et al., 2004, 2006;\nMcDonald, 1973], transport water and sediment directly\nto the stream network [Holden et al., 2007b]. They were\ncommonly cut directly into the peat, often running parallel\nto the hillslope contours. The depths of channel flow in\nthese drains range from zero to a few centimeters. Many\npeatland drains now have revegetated floors. This vegeta-\ntion is likely to influence the speed of water delivery\nthrough the drains and into the downstream channel\nnetwork. There have been no studies, to the authors\u2019\nknowledge, on the impact of peatland drains or drain\nrevegetation on channel flow velocities.\n[7] Given the dominance of floodplain or channel flow\nresistance studies, where channels are in excess of 10 cm\n[e.g., Ja\u00a8rvela\u00a8, 2004] and an emphasis on overland flows in\nvery different environments, surprisingly little is known\nabout the influence of surface vegetation on shallow over-\nland flow velocity in peatlands. This information is now\nneeded urgently as both semidistributed and distributed\nmodels of peatland hydrological response are being\ncombined with high-resolution topographic data in order\nto predict the nature of saturation and hydrological connec-\nFigure 1. Sphagnum ground cover on a peatland surface,\nwith some localized grass swards.\n2 of 11\nW06415 HOLDEN ET AL.: OVERLAND FLOW IN PEATLANDS W06415\ntivity of saturation-excess overland flows across hillslopes\n[Lane et al., 2003, 2004]. While the resistance formulae\ncommonly used in hydraulics for river and floodplain flows\nwere not derived for overland flow characterization, they\nare very commonly used to describe overland flow [e.g.,\nDunne and Dietrich, 1980; Baird et al., 1992; Grayson and\nMoore, 1992; Scoging et al., 1992]. A consistent flow law,\npreferably based on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor\n(which can be used in situations where depth dependence\nis necessary) that could be applied to peatland flow\nmodeling would be useful. If there are large differences\nbetween vegetated and unvegetated drain channels, or\nbetween overland flows through different surface vegetation\ntypes, then this may not be achievable, but we do not have\nthe data to test for such differences. Hence, in this paper, we\ninvestigate the impacts of vegetation cover, slope and water\ndepth on flow velocities both within drains and over peat-\nland surfaces and develop physically based equations to\ndescribe these impacts.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Site\n[8] Field measurements were obtained for the Upper\nWharfe catchment, UK (54\u0001130N, 2\u0001130W). Blanket peat\nup to 2 m deep overlies shallow glacial tills and mixed\nCarboniferous sandstones and limestones [Merrett and\nMacklin, 1999]. The peats in the area are dominated by\nEriophorum (cotton grasses) and Sphagnum (mosses).\nShrub species such as Calluna (ling, heather) on the peats\nare rare. The water table in the peats is usually within 30 cm\nof the surface for most of the year and rises rapidly to the\nsurface during rainfall events, frequently producing exten-\nsive saturation-excess overland flow [Holden, 2006]. There\nare extensive areas of peatland drains.\n3.2. Overland Flow\n[9] A total of 256 bounded overland flow plots were\nestablished each being 0.5 m wide by 6 m in length. Plot\nslopes ranged from 0.01 to 0.55 m m\u00021. Surface slopes were\nmeasured using a total station and plots were chosen which\nhad uniform slopes throughout their length. Four surface\ncover categories were chosen with 64 plots consisting of a\nsurface cover of Sphagnum, and 64 on each of Eriophorum,\nSphagnum-Eriophorum mix and bare surfaces. Water was\nsupplied to each plot via a variable-speed pump and hosing.\nWater was pumped onto the plot until flow became uniform\nfrom the plot outlet. Rhodamine WT dye was then injected\nand travel times determined using an automatic logging\nfluorometer. This allowed both leading edge (time of first\narrival of dye [Dunkerley, 2001]) and centroid travel times\nto be calculated. This meant that the problems associated\nwith the visual timing of dye front arrival discussed by\nAbrahams et al. [1986] and Dunkerley [2001, 2003] were\navoided. Also, with the spatial scale of the plots used,\nabsorption effects were sufficiently small for the results to\nbe reliable. The experiment was repeated at four different\ndischarges (these were determined by the settings of the\npump which provided flow at Q1 = 0.05, Q2 = 0.08,\nQ3 = 0.2 and Q4 = 0.5 L s\u00021) for each plot so that in total\n1024 measurements of travel times were performed. Mean\nwater depths were measured on each plot by using a caliper\nplaced on 10 random points per plot. The flow did not\ntotally submerge vegetation during the experiments, except\nfor some of the Sphagnum-covered plots. The research\ndesign excludes responses to raindrop impact.\n3.3. Drain Flow\n[10] For the drain flow measurements, 64 open surface\ndrain reaches of 30 m length were chosen with a relatively\nuniform slope, channel width and depth within each reach.\nNatural flow events were used for the experiments and the\ndye and fluorometer were used to measure travel times. The\nexperiment was repeated four times on each drain reach at\ndifferent discharge rates. The experiment was also repeated\nfor 64 drain reaches that were naturally revegetating. The\nvegetation had grown on the floor and walls of the drains\nbut the drains were still hydrologically functioning. Half of\nthese drain reaches were revegetating with Sphagnum, and\nhalf (i.e., 32) with Juncus (tall thick stemmed grass). In total\nthere were 512 drain flow measurements.\n3.4. Theory and Analysis\n[11] Use of the fluorometer allowed the time of the fastest\nflow, Vm, and the centroid or mean flow, V , to be measured.\nFor a parabolic (laminar) flow profile, where velocity is\nzero at the bed and reaches a maximum at the surface [Katz\net al., 1995]:\nV \u00bc 0:67Vm \u00f01\u00de\n[12] However, the presence of vegetation and an uneven\nsoil surface will probably lead to a divergence from this\nform and so a coefficient, a, is needed that depends on the\nroughness properties of the surface and vegetation [Li et al.,\n1996; Dunkerley, 2001] and which describes the relative\ndifference between peak and centroid dye arrival time:\nV \u00bc aVm \u00f02\u00de\n[13] Resistance to flow is commonly described by the\nDarcy-Weisbach equation:\nV\n2 \u00bc 8g\nf\ndS \u00f03\u00de\nwhere S is the slope and g is gravitational acceleration. It is\npossible to relate the dimensionless friction factor, f, to the\nratio of depth, d to an effective roughness diameter, k\n[Robert, 2003] using a relation of the form:\n1ffiffi\nf\np \u00bc A\u00fe 1:77 ln d\nk\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00bc A\u00fe 4:07 log10\nd\nk\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere A is an empirically defined constant. Therefore k is\ncalculated from equation (4) and this relationship is shown\nin Figure 2. For the low ratios of depth to roughness\nencountered in overland flow, in which the roughness\nelements are not submerged grains or bed forms, but where\nleaves and stems protrude from the flow, (4) becomes\nproblematic because of difficulties in determining the\neffective depth of overland flow and because of the\ndistribution of roughness elements within the flow depth.\nThis problem is commonly recognized in rivers partly as a\nreference height issue [e.g., Lane et al., 2002] and it\nW06415 HOLDEN ET AL.: OVERLAND FLOW IN PEATLANDS\n3 of 11\nW06415\nbecomes more severe in overland flow studies because of\nthe difficulty in determining exactly the elevation at which\nvelocity becomes zero. The second aspect to this problem is\nthat equation (4) assumes that roughness elements are on the\nbed, and fully submerged. In many overland flow situations\ninvolving vegetation some or all roughness elements are\nonly partially submerged and\/or extend through the flow as\nvegetation stems, which may be branched and\/or progres-\nsively dragged down by the flow. To avoid these problems,\nwe do not take these relationships as given, but test the\nextent to which they hold for the special case of overland\nflow on the surfaces studied here.\n[14] It is often customary to plot f as a function of Re\n[e.g., Chen, 1976; Dunne and Dietrich, 1980; Gilley et al.,\n1992; Abrahams and Parsons, 1994; Dunkerley et al.,\n2001], or f as a function of V . However, as Kouwen and\nFathi-Moghadam [2000] and Lane and Hardy [2002] point\nout, these plots commonly display a spurious correlation\nFigure 2. The relationship between Darcy-Weisbach roughness (f \u00020.5) and the ratio of mean depth to\neffective roughness (d\/k) from equation (4) (a) on a lognormal plot for comparison with later Figures 3\u20136\nin this paper, with dotted curve sketching the relationship proposed by Lawrence [1997] for shallow\ndepths ( f\b d\/k), and (b) on a log-log plot. The dotted straight line indicates the fit over the range 10 < d\/k <\n10000 that is consistent with Manning\u2019s equation for which f \u00020.5\b (d\/k)1\/6. The solid bold line indicates a\nfit in the region 0.5 < d\/k < 2 that is more appropriate to overland flow, for which f \u00020.5 \b (d\/k)1.0.\n4 of 11\nW06415 HOLDEN ET AL.: OVERLAND FLOW IN PEATLANDS W06415\nbecause the same parameter is used in estimating terms on\nboth sides of the plot. For example, a plot of f against V\nmay be dominated by the 1\/V 2 versus V pattern, which even\nif random numbers were used for V would still produce a\nlog linear correlation.\n[15] Savat [1980] showed that overland flow, with the\nhigh Froude numbers and roll waves characteristic\nof shallow flows, significantly crosses between the laminar\n(f \b Re\u00021) and turbulent (f \b Re\u00021\/4) flow regimes,\nindicating that the solid line in Figure 2 becomes steeper\nat low depths corresponding to the laminar flow regime. An\nalternative approach has been presented by Lawrence\n[1997], based on work by Phelps [1975]. This expresses\nthe frictional resistance of partially and completely sub-\nmerged large grains or boundary elements, and indicates\nthat resistance increases with increasing depth (the dotted\nlines on Figure 2). Takken and Govers [2000] also recog-\nnized that effective roughness and flow velocities reflected\ngrain textures, the overall cross sections of the flow and its\ntortuosity, making it difficult to estimate equivalent rough-\nness except by working back from the observed flow. From\nthese studies of shallow flows, it seems most relevant to\nnote that an empirical approach may be most appropriate,\nbut that there may be a change in behavior as the soil\nsurface first becomes fully submerged.\n4. Results\n[16] Our data suggest that surface cover exerts a strong\ncontrol over overland flow velocity in peats. Table 1\nprovides the means and standard errors for the overland\nflow velocities. The velocity of overland flow ranged from\n0.191 m s\u00021 to 1.22 \t 10\u00024 m s\u00021 with a mean of 0.029 m\ns\u00021. As would be expected, mean overland flow velocity\nwas significantly higher for bare surfaces than for vegetated\nsurfaces for all discharge categories. The velocities\nassociated with Sphagnum were significantly lower than\nfor other vegetation types at p < 0.001 for Eriophorum and\nbare surfaces, and p = 0.03 for Sphagnum versus Eriophorum-\nSphagnum mixed surfaces. This suggests that Sphagnum is\nbetter at attenuating flow velocities than the other cover\ntypes tested.\n[17] Global application of (2) gave a mean value of a of\n0.35 (standard error = 0.01). Surface cover type was a\nsignificant factor (p = 0.022) in determining a, with bare\nand Eriophorum-Sphagnum mixed surfaces having signifi-\ncantly lower values of a than total Eriophorum or Sphagnum\ncovers. Slope was only found to be a significant control over\na for those plots with some Sphagnum cover and it was not a\nsignificant control of a for bare or Eriophorum-covered\nslopes. Water depth had a significant positive control (p <\n0.001) over a for all surface covers.\n[18] The extent to which the overland flow in peat\nadheres to the Darcy-Weisbach expression (3) can be seen\nby plotting 1\/\np\nf against mean flow depth, with depth on a\nlogarithmic scale to allow comparison with Figure 2.\nFigure 3 shows the results obtained for Eriophorum as an\nexample. Scatter in the data within a particular surface cover\ntype such as Eriophorum may relate to differences in\ncoverage or maturity of plants. To reduce the large scatter\nof the raw data, the values have been sorted by depth and\nmedians taken for consecutive runs of 19 points, and these\nmedian values are also plotted. It may be seen that the data\nfalls into two groups, which can be separated around the\ndepths of 0.007\u20130.01 m. Reduced major axis (RMA)\nregression has been applied to the median values in each\ngroup. This method emphasizes the functional relationship\nbetween the two variables without giving causal preference\nto either one. Comparison with Figure 2 shows a similar\nregion of shallow flows with gradually increasing roughness\n(reducing 1\/\np\nf), and a deeper region in which there is a\nstronger logarithmic decrease of roughness with depth.\n[19] Figure 4 summarizes the \u2018\u2018doglegged\u2019\u2019 relationships,\nderived in the same way, for each of the four surface covers,\nshowing relationships that are significant for the median\npoints except in the case of the Sphagnum cover.\n[20] Darcy-Weisbach roughness equation (4) suggests an\nexponent that varies with the ratio of flow depth to rough-\nness length. Following equation (4), the depth exponent of\n\b2\/3 should be only approximately valid over the range 10 <\nd\/k < 104, with much larger exponents needed at lower\nrelative depths, with an exponent of about 1.5 for 0.5 <\nd\/k < 2. These values correspond to the solid lines drawn\nin Figure 2.\nTable 1.

While it is possible\nto fit such a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 4, the\nslope of the line is very much smaller (0.014\u20130.046) than\nthe constant of 1.77 in (4), indicating that relative rough-\nness changes only very little with depth. This seems\ncompatible with the conditions prevailing in shallow\noverland flows where uniform vegetation and surface grain\nproperties extend throughout the range of flow depths\nexperienced.\n[22] For flow in ditches, flow depths, although small, are\nsomewhat higher than for the overland flow measurements,\nso that the lower leg of the relationship seen in Figures 3\nand 4 is less evident. Data for Juncus alone shows only very\npoor correlation, and data for Sphagnum and unvegetated\nsurfaces has been combined with the overland flow data\nto produce a single relationship, shown in Figures 5\n(Sphagnum) and 6 (unvegetated). The regression coefficients\nand correlation coefficients are summarized in Table 2, using\nthe median data in all cases, so that significance levels are\nonly indicative since they are not based on the raw data.\n[23] First it is noted that not all bed roughness elements are\nsubmerged during overland flow, and that the effects of\nroughness elements along the margins (often multiple mar-\ngins) are much more important than for normal stream flow.\nSecond it is noted that vegetative elements commonly extend\nthrough the entire flow. Third it is noted that different species\nhave different distributions of roughness elements with\nheight. Thus Sphagnum appears to be almost uniformly\ndistributed through the flow (as would be expected given\nits structure shown in Figure 1), whereas Eriophorum and\nJuncus present more cylindrical stem elements that go\nthrough the full flow depth. Some other species branch near\nthe base, so that effective roughness elements increase with\nflow depth. Finally vegetation may be dragged down into the\nflow [Freeman et al., 2000], so that roughness is dynamically\nreduced at high flows.\nFigure 3.

Summary of RMA regression lines for overland flow, similar to Figure 3, for the four surface\ncovers: Eriophorum (thick black line), mixed Eriophorum\/Sphagnum (dashed line), Sphagnum (thin\nblack line), and bare (gray line).\n6 of 11\nW06415 HOLDEN ET AL.: OVERLAND FLOW IN PEATLANDS W06415\n[24] Overall then, the Darcy-Weisbach roughness\nequation (3) may be a valid definition of the gross rough-\nness, but the relationship to depth and roughness (4), which\nis based on classical roughness theory and the logarithmic\nvelocity profile, appears to be only valid for flows greater\nthan about 1 cm deep, and with regression coefficients\nsubstantially less than the value in equation (4). This low\ndependence of roughness on flow depth may suggest that\nthe effective ratio of depth to roughness does not change as\nrapidly with depth as for a strict grain roughness, and may\nbe linked to the concept of roughness elements (plant stems)\nextending through the flow.\n5. Discussion\n[25] Looking at the similarities between Figures 3 to 6,\nthere seems to be a fairly consistent pattern of roughness\nvariation, and a consistent set of differences between the\ndifferent types of cover, which is in agreement with intuitive\nobservations about the relative resistance offered. Flows\nover bare surfaces are substantially faster than forEriophorum,\nwhich is, in turn, faster than for Sphagnum. Mixtures of\nEriophorum and Sphagnum are intermediate between the\ntwo pure surfaces. Juncus, although not giving significant\nresults, has rates similar to Sphagnum.\n[26] In all cases there is a significant break in process\nbetween flows with a water depth greater than \b1 cm and\nflows with a water depth less than \b1 cm. This is consistent\nwith the break in process shown in Figure 1, indicating that\nthe ground surface is only partially submerged in shallower\nflows, following the theory of Lawrence [1997]. Within the\nrange of error of the experimental data, the slopes of the\nfalling and rising limb of the curves shown in Figures 3\u20136\n( f \u00020.5 versus depth) increase and decrease together, so that\na first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness (and\nthen mean velocity) can be made on the basis of a single\nparameter for each surface cover. The general form of this\nforecasting model is then:\nvffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n8grs\np \u00bc 1ffiffi\nf\np \u00bc Max A\u0002 B1 log10\nd\nk\n\u0002 \u0003\n; A\u00fe B2 log10\nd\nk\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\n\u00f05\u00de\nwhere A = 0.005, B1 = 0.1 B2 and k = 0.01 m to account for\nthe consistent break in process we found at depths of around\n1 cm.\n[27] Values for B2 are estimated as follows, following the\nrange of values in Table 2: bare 1.3, Eriophorum 0.3,\nEriophorum\/Sphagnum mix 0.2, and Sphagnum and Juncus\n0.1.\n[28] Figure 7 has been constructed to compare the\nobserved values of f \u00020.5 for all raw data points with the\nestimates of equation (5). It can be seen that there remains a\nsubstantial scatter, with a tenfold range either way needed to\nFigure 5. Combined ditch and overland flow data for Sphagnum.\nTable 2.

Since the observed values vary\nacross 2 orders of magnitude, this is a worthwhile compres-\nsion of the data. The correlation coefficient between\nobserved and estimated values is 0.581 which is significant\nat p < 0.001. Additionally, the simplicity of this empirical\nmodel is a major advantage over more complex fluid\ndynamic models and reduces the amount of data required\nto produce estimates of overland flow velocity across peat-\nlands for use in travel time and flood wave generation\nstudies.\n[29] Figure 6 immediately leads to an expression to\nforecast mean velocity. It can be seen that velocity increases\nvery slowly with depth until the surface is fully submerged.\nIt then increases rapidly to begin with and more slowly as\ndepth increases up to the limit of the data (\b5 cm). Note\nthat we have not measured velocity profiles through the\nwater column and that the above comments are with respect\nto the experiments we conducted on flows which achieved\ndifferent depths. It is necessary to bridge between the two\nlegs of the roughness curve, to ensure that velocity does not\ndecrease with water depth at any stage. This is done in\ngeneral by combining the two expressions into a continuous\nempirical curve: Thus if f1\n\u00020.5 = A\u0002B1 log10(r\/k) and f2\u00020.5 =\nA + B2 log10(r\/k), the combined estimate of roughness is\ntaken as:\nf \u00020:5 \u00bc 1\nm\nln exp f \u00020:51\n\u0006 \u0007\u0006 \u0007m\u00fe exp f \u00020:52\u0006 \u0007\u0006 \u0007m\b \t \u00f06\u00de\nwhere m is chosen to ensure that the velocity increases\nmonotonically with water depth. In practice, m \b 3 for bare\nsurfaces and rises to \b150 for Sphagnum, changing\ninversely to the values of B2. These curves are indicated\nin Figures 3, 5, and 6. The form of equation (6) has been\nchosen to allow the combination of positive and negative\nvalues, and to converge on f1\n\u00020.5 and f2\n\u00020.5 respectively at\nsmall and large depths.\n[30] The combined estimates for velocity are sketched in\nFigure 8, which shows the estimated change of velocity\nwith water depth on a 10% gradient, for unvegetated\nsurfaces, Eriophorum and Sphagnum. The sharpness of\nthe step where behavior changes from submergence domi-\nnance to roughness behavior, at water depths of around\n0.01 m, is not well defined, depending strongly on the\nvalues of the exponent m in equation (6), which is not well\nconstrained. However, the forecasts share a generally low\nincrease of velocity with overall water depth until the\nsurface is submerged, followed by a rapid increase of\nvelocity (\bd2) and then a progressive decline in the rate\nof increase, eventually falling to the Manning equation\nvalue of d2\/3.\n[31] The expression for roughness retains a constant\nexponent of 0.5 for gradient, and this is confirmed by other\nresearch with an immobile bed. However, where the bed is\nmobile (bare peat), this dependence no longer appears to\nhold [Govers et al., 2007] and velocity may become\nindependent of gradient.\n[32] The value of a is often used as a correction factor by\nworkers studying overland flow travel time [e.g., Beuselinck\net al., 1999]. It is easier to measure the time of arrival for the\nleading edge of a tracer than it is to measure peak or\ncentroid times. Emmett [1970] found that a was between\n0.5 and 0.6 for laminar flow and was close to 0.8 for\nFigure 6. Combined ditch and overland flow data for bare (unvegetated) surfaces.\nFigure 7. Comparing observed values of f \u00020.5 with\nforecasts based on equation (5) for all raw data points.\n8 of 11\nW06415 HOLDEN ET AL.: OVERLAND FLOW IN PEATLANDS W06415\nturbulent flow. For overland flow in the present study, the\nmean value of a was 0.35. Slope was a significant control\nover a for overland flow plots only where Sphagnum was\npresent; a was greater on steeper slopes. This is in direct\ncontrast to the flume study of Li et al. [1996], who found a\nvaried inversely with slope. Water depth was also a signi-\nficant factor in determining a on the overland flow plots.\nTherefore, for overland flow, a uniform a is not reasonable.\nSimilarly a large scatter of a values was determined for the\npeat drains signifying that a uniform value of a would not\nbe appropriate. Therefore conversion of leading edge travel\ntimes to estimate mean flow velocities in peatlands is\nnot appropriate. This is in line with laboratory work by\nDunkerley [2001], who examined a on sandy surfaces and\nverifies approaches that measure the whole dye wave to\ndetermine centroid travel times rather than relying on\nleading-edge travel times and the correction factor.\n6. Conclusions\n[33] Many saturated slopes such as those in peatlands\nfrequently experience overland flow depths of the order of a\nfew millimeters to a few centimeters. Sphagnum provided a\nsignificantly greater effective roughness to overland flow\nthan other surface types. Sphagnum, with its dense branching\nand uniform structure with depth, has been lost from many\npeatlands through land management (e.g., overgrazing) or\nsulphate deposition [Holden et al., 2007a]. This will have\nimplications for overland flow travel times potentially\nleading to shortened stream lag times. Indeed even if a\npeatland surface remains fully vegetated, our results suggest\nthat if the vegetation type is altered then flow velocities\ncould change leading to alterations in the timing of runoff\ndelivery from slopes to streams. Reestablishment of\nSphagnum [Holden et al., 2007a] on degraded (especially\nbare) peatlands may therefore be important for reducing\nthe potential for sheet erosion and downstream flood peaks\nmore than Eriophorum or Eriophorum-Sphagnum mixes.\n[34] In all treatments studied in this paper, a significant\nbreak in process occurred at a depth of around 1 cm. This is\nan important finding as it represents nonlinear feedback\nwhereby overland flow velocity increases dramatically once\na critical depth range is passed. This is consistent with\npartial submergence theory for very shallow flows where\nresistance increases with depth as the soil surface first\nbecomes fully submerged. However, the results also suggest\nthat a first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness and\nmean velocity can be based on a single parameter for each\nsurface cover and the paper presents an empirical forecast-\ning model that can be applied to peatlands for partially and\nfully submerged surfaces. Therefore, better representations\nof overland flow travel times across blanket peatlands will\nnow be possible if vegetation cover maps are available and\nif empirically based equations are used for each cover type.\nOf course mean velocity, which was described in this paper,\nis only one component of the velocity field across a surface\nand there are likely to be variations in vertical and lateral\nvelocity profiles between cover types that are worthy of\nexploration in future work.\n[35] Acknowledgments.
