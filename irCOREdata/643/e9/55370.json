Total nitrogen in either must or \nwine includes inorganic and organic \nforms, and is measured after the \nmineralisation of all forms of nitrogen \nin the sample by the addition of sulfuric \nacid and heating. Nitrogen forms are \nthus converted into ammonium sulfate, \nwhich is removed by distillation after \nthe addition of sodium hydroxide, and \nthen assayed by titration with an acid \nsolution (Kjeldahl method). The total \nnitrogen concentration in wines varies \nfrom 70 to 400 mg l-1 for white wines \nand from 140 to 700 mg l-1 for red \nwines.1 \nNitrogenated substances may there-\nfore represent up to 20% of the dry \nextract in dry wines. The influence of \nammonium and aminated nitrogen on \nboth, the start and rate of the \nfermentation process, has been demon-\nstrated.2 Completeness of sugar trans-\nformation also depends on the \nconcentration of these compounds, \ntogether with the functioning of the \nyeast. The amount of ammonium varies \nfrom 30 to 100 mg l-1 in must and up to \n10 mg l-1 in red and white wines;2 \nmeanwhile, the amount of aminated \nnitrogen varies from 80 to 300 mg l-1 in \nmust, from 60 to 200 mg l-1 in red \nwines and from 10 to 150 mg l-1 in  \nwhite  wines.2  \nThe analysis of each fraction must \nbe made separately. Thus, the analysis \nof aminated nitrogen makes use of the \nreaction with 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene-\nsulfonic acid (TNBS)3 or ninhydrine,4 \nand that of ammonium is based on \nretention on an ionic exchange resin \nand subsequent tritation with hy-\ndrochloric acid.5 However, a simpler \ntechnique for the determination of both \nparameters involves an official Italian \nlegislative method.6 It consists of \nblocking the aminic function using \nformaldehyde, followed  by potentio-\nmetric titration with sodium hydroxide \nusing a pH electrode. This is a not a \nprecise method, but its precision is \nsufficient for an estimated value of \nreadily assimilable nitrogen (r.a.n.) by \nyeast during fermentation, Thus, it is \ncommonly used in winery laboratories. \nNo automated methods for the joint \ndetermination of ammonium and amino \nnitrogen have been described in the \nliterature. The only method is to \ndetermine both parameters individually. \nSeveral automated methods have been \nreported for the analysis of amines, but \nnone gives the overall amine content. \nPrimary,7 secondary8 and tertiary9 \namines are usually determined fluo-\nrimetrically after derivatisation. \nFlow injection (FI) methods for the \ndetermination of ammonium in a great \nvariety of matrices have been widely \ndescribed in the literature. \nNevertheless, there is scarce infor-\nmation on the determination of this \nanalyte in wines and must. Only one \nmethod for the determination of \nammonium in wine, using gas diffusion \nand bulk acoustic wave detection, has \nbeen described.10 \nAnalyst, 2002, Vol. 127, 420-423   \n \n3  \n \n \nFigure 1. Manifold for the determination of readily assimilable nitrogen. PP= peristaltic \npump, SV= selection valve, IV= injection valve, R= reactor, D= detector, w= waste, q= \nflow-rate. \n \nThe objective of this work was to \ndevelop a rapid method for the \ndetermination of r.a.n. with sufficient \nprecision for winery requirements: (i) to \nguarantee the monitoring of the \nfermentation process; and (ii) for use to \nmonitor this parameter during the \nbiological aging of Sherry-type wines. \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used is outlined in Fig.1. \nIt was built using a four-channel Gilson \nMinipuls-3 peristaltic pump (Villiers le \nBel, France) fitted with a rate selector; \ntwo Rheodyne 5041 injection valves \n(Elkay, Galway, Ireland), one of them \nused as selection valve, and PTFE \ntubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (Scharlau, \nBarcelona, Spain). A PU 8625 spectro- \n \nphotometer (Cambridge, UK) equipped \nwith a Hellma 138-QS flow-cell \n(Hellma, Jamaica, NY) and connected \nto a Knauer recorder, was also used. \nStatistical treatments were made \nusing statgraphics\u2122 plus for windows \n2.1. \n \nReagents and solutions \nFor the reference method, 0.1 and 1 M \nsodium hydroxide solutions, 0.5 M of \nbarium chloride solution, hydrochloric \nacid and 40 % (v\/v) formaldehyde \nsolution, all from Panreac (Barcelona, \nSpain) were used. \nFor the proposed method, 6x 10-4 M \nbromothymol blue in 14 g l-1 \nphosphate-buffered solution at pH 8, \nboth from Merck (Darmstadt, \nGermany) and 6 % (v\/v) formaldehyde \nin 5 g l-1 phosphate buffered solution at \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                                                                                          \n \n4 \npH 11.5, from Panreac and Merck, were \nused.  \nAll solutions were prepared using \ndoubly distilled water of high purity \nobtained from a Millipore Milli-Q plus \nsystem (Bedford, MA, USA). \n \nReference procedure \nOne hundred millilitres of either must \nor wine was taken and its pH was \nadjusted to 8 with 1 M NaOH. Then, 10 \nml of 0.5 M barium chloride was added. \nAfter 15 min, the suspension was \ndiluted to 200 ml and filtered. One \nhundred millilitres of the filtered \nsolution was taken and again the pH \nwas adjusted to 8 if necessary. Twenty \nfive millilitres of formaldehyde solution \nwas added, and 15 min later, the \nmixture was titrated to pH 8 with 0.1 M \nsodium hydroxide. The content of r.a.n. \nin wine was obtained by multiplying by \n28 the millilitres of NaOH used. The \nresult is expressed in mg l-1. \n \nProposed method \nFigure 1 shows the manifold used for \nthe proposed determination. The sample \nwas driven to merge with buffer \nsolution with or without formaldehyde \nand both were homogenised along R1 \nand introduced into the loop of the \ninjection valve (IV). The sequence was \nas follows: with the selection valve \n(SV) in the position for supplying  \nbuffer solution alone, valve IV was \nswitched to the injection position, the \ninjected plug merged with a stream of \nbromothymol blue and the absorbance \nat 616 nm was monitored. After this, \nSV was switched to the position for \naspirating buffer + formaldehyde solu-\ntion, and the new sample thus diluted \nfilled the loop of IV and was then \ninjected. The difference in absorbance \nbetween the two measurements at 616 \nnm gave the value of r.a.n. \nThe analytical signal varies due to \nthe difference in the sample pH in the \npresence and absence of formaldehyde. \nThis compound blocks the amino \nfunction and the subsequent change in \npH is monitored through its effect on \nthe absorbance of bromothymol blue \nmeasured at 616 nm. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nOptimisation of the method \nThe variables which affect the method \nfor the determination of the target \nparameter were studied by either the \nmultivariate or univariate approach \ndepending on the existence or not of \ninterrelated variables. The ranges \nstudied and the optimal values found \nare shown in Table 1. \n \nChemical variables \nFigure 2 shows a plot of the absorbance \nvalues versus both indicator buffer and \nformaldehyde in the solution that \nmerges with the sample. Because the P \nvalue in the ANOVA table is less than \n0.01, there is a statistically significant \nrelationship between the variables at \n99% confidence level. The equation of \nthe fitted model is: Abs= 0.419 \u2013 6x10-4 \n[buffer] + 4.5x10-4 [formaldehyde]. \nThere are not significant differences in \nthe absorbance produced by the lowest \nand highest concentrations of the buffer \nAnalyst, 2002, Vol. 127, 420-423   \n \n5  \n(the absorbance changes between 0.408 \nand 0.436). A similar behaviour is \nobserved for the instrumental variable \nversus formaldehyde concentration. \nThus, the lowest concentrations were \nselected for further experiments in \norder to save reagents. Both the range \nstudied and the optimum value found \nfor other variables are summarised in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1.

In the \ncase of must, a loss of linearity was \nobserved for concentrations higher than \n400 mg l-1. A logarithmic response was \nfound for these concentrations. The \nconcentrations of the target parameter \n(r.a.n.) were in the range 15-60 mg l-1 \nand 15-400 mg l-1, for wines and must, \nrespectively. The presence of SO2 from \n1 mg l-1 to 50 mg l-1 did not interfere in \nthe analysis, nor did carbon dioxide. \nThen, samples of both wines and must \nwere analysed. \n \nAssessment of the proposed method \nThirty different white wines and ten \nmust samples were used in the \nassessment study. Each value was the \naverage of three determinations. The \nprotocol for assessment consisted of \nstudying the analytical parameters, such \nas linear range, traceability with a \nreference method, repeatability, repro-\nducibility, detection and quantification  \n \nlimits and sample throughput. A \nrobustness study was also developed. \n \nRepeatability (r)  \nThe F test was applied in order to \nestablish whether the differences \nbetween the repeatabilities of the \nmethods were significant. With this \naim, Fobs=Sr2 \/ Sref2 was compared with \nthe F1-\u03b1 obtained from F tables for \n\u03b1=0.05 (P=95%). As can be observed \nin Table 2, Fobs<F1-\u03b1, and so the \nrepeatabilities of the FI and reference \nmethods are similar. It is worth pointing \nout that the repeatability of the FI \nmethod is better than that of the \nreference method. \n \nReproducibility (R) (30 days)  \nTable 2 also shows the R values \nobtained, as well as the results from the \napplication of the F test. The repro-\nducibility of the FI method is better \nthan that of the reference method. Both \nmethods are statistically equal. \n \nTable 2.

Fig. 4 shows the \nregression of the FI method for r.a.n. on \nthe reference method. The regression \nequation, Y= 0.9999 X \u2013 1.34 (r= \n0.990), shows good correlation between \nthe data from both methods. \nConfidence limits of 95% are shown in \nFig. 4 in dotted lines. In both cases, the \ntraceability was assured using the t-test. \nThe data used in the correlation study \nof the methods were subjected to \nprevious processing because of the \npresence of a systematic and a constant \nerror in all concentration ranges \nstudied. In this way, the systematic \nerror was perfectly known, evaluated \nand substracted from the raw data, as \nthe error increased the analytical signal \nby a value of 2.144. This systematic \nerror was  due to the contribution of the \nfollowing effects: (i) a significant \nmatrix effect due to organic acids \npresent in wine; and (ii) changes in the \nstandard method when adapted to the \ndynamic approach (no barium chloride \nwas used). This last aspect was checked \nin both batch and dynamic methods by \neither adding or not, barium chloride to \n10 wine samples in order to precipitate \nproteins. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Critical \nvariables of the system are the flow rate \nand the concentrations of formalde-\nhyde, bromothymol blue and buffer in \nboth the indicator and formaldehyde \nsolutions. These variables were modi-\nfied \u00b110% from their optimum values. \nErrors lower than 5% were observed, \nexcept for the indicator solution, which \nyielded changes of 8% of the analytical \nsignal in the range under study. \n \nApplication of the method \nA study of the r.a.n. content in 120 \nsamples was made by the proposed \nmethod. The collection of 120 samples \nwas the result of programmed sampling \nof barrels and tanks following the \ntraditional \u201ccriaderas\u201d and \u201csoleras\u201d \nsystem. Aging of Sherry wine is a \ndynamic, not static, process, involving \nperiodic partial transfers from barrels of \na young wine to those with an old wine. \nThus, from each barrel containing the \nwine in the oldest aging state (named as \n\u201csolera\u201d), a fraction is withdrawn for \nfining and bottling. The \u201csolera\u201d barrels \nare filled with the same volume of wine \nfrom a barrel row at an earlier aging \nstate (the first \u201ccriadera\u201d), which in turn \nreceives wine from other barrels of \nyounger wine (second \u201ccriadera\u201d), and \nso on. The row at lowest aging state \n(third \u201ccriadera\u201d) is filled every 5-6 \nmonths with not aged wine from the \ntanks. The minimum duration of the \naging process of Sherry wine is 2.0-2.5 \nyears.  \nDue to the high number of barrels \nin the winery (almost 10000) and tanks \n(almost 280) the application of the \nreference method for the analysis of the \n120 samples would require 9 days. \nUsing the developed FI method the \nanalysis was performed in one day.  \nThe result of the analyses of \nsamples from \u201ccriaderas\u201d and \u201csoleras\u201d \nyielded not difference in r.a.n. contents, \nwhich were between 25 and 35 mg l-1. \nWhen the tanks were studied, differ-\nences were found depending on the \npresence or absence of \u201cflor yeast\u201d. The \nhighest values of r.a.n. in tanks ranged \nbetween 50 and 60 mg l-1.  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe proposed method shows sufficient \nprecision for the needs of wineries and \ncan be used to test nitrogen availability \n(r.a.n.) for both fermentation and \nbiological aging processes. It is a \nsimple, inexpensive method, which \npresents a good correlation with the \nreference method used commonly for \nthe determination of this parameter and \ncould be easily implemented in \nwineries. Other advantages of the meth-\nod reported here are the capability for \neasy automation and a sampling \nthroughput higher than that of the \nmethod used routinely in wineries. This \nlatter aspect allows to analyse a large \nnumber of barrels, thus providing \nvaluable biological information on the \nnutritional state of the \u201cflor yeast\u201d . \n \nJ.
