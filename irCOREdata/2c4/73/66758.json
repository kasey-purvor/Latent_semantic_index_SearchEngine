Introduction\nMetamorphic soles have been described beneath ultra-\nmafic rocks in orogenic peridotite massifs and ophio-\nlite suites in many parts of the world (e.g. Williams &\nSmyth, 1973; Jamieson, 1980, 1986; Searle & Malpas,\n1980; Lippard, Shelton & Gass, 1986; Boudier,\nCeuleneer & Nicolas, 1988; Boudier et al. 1988). Such\nmetamorphic soles are usually defined as thin zones of\nmetamorphic rocks which show mylonitic fabrics,\npolyphase deformation and an inverted sequence of\nmetamorphic assemblages that decrease in grade from\ngranulite\u2013amphibolite facies immediately in contact\nwith overlying basal peridotites to greenschist facies at\nlower structural levels (Jamieson, 1980). In early inves-\ntigations, the development of a metamorphic sole was\ninterpreted to result from the thermal effect of associ-\nated ultramafic rocks, which were regarded as hot\nintrusions or diapirs (Green, 1964a; MacKenzie,\n1960). Since the early 1970s, however, it has been\nshown that most metamorphic soles are related to\nmetamorphism and deformation during overthrusting\nof hot lithospheric fragments either in an intra-\noceanic setting (Church & Stevens, 1971; Williams &\nSmyth, 1973; Searle & Malpas, 1980; Boudier,\nCeuleneer & Nicolas, 1988; Cawood & Suhr, 1992;\nFergusson & Cawood, 1995), or within orogenic belts\n(e.g. Tubia, Cuevas & Gil Ibarguchi, 1997). The rela-\ntively hot overriding ultramafic sheet is inferred to\nprovide most of the heat necessary for the observed\nmetamorphism in the cooler footwall rocks (Jamieson,\n1980). In the better-preserved examples (e.g. Bay of\nIslands Complex and Oman), mylonitic fabrics in the\nmetamorphic sole parallel those in the basal peridotite\nmylonites, and kinematic indicators show the same\nsense of shear (Boudier, Nicolas & Bouchez, 1982;\nGirardeau, 1982; Boudier et al. 1985; Boudier,\nCeuleneer & Nicolas, 1988; Cawood & Suhr, 1992;\nFergusson & Cawood, 1995).\nThe Lizard Complex has long been described as an\nophiolite based on the intimate association of peri-\ndotites, gabbros and a mafic dyke complex (e.g. Thayer,\n1969; Bromley, 1973). Geochemical studies have shown\nthat many of the mafic crustal rocks have compositions\ntypical of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB; e.g. Floyd,\nLees & Parker, 1976; Kirby, 1979).

In this paper, the contacts between\nthe Lizard peridotites and Landewednack amphibo-\nlites are re-examined in detail, together with shear\nzone fabrics and faults in the overlying peridotites and\nunderlying Landewednack amphibolites. Several\nphases of shearing are observed, each with distinct\nassociated metamorphic mineral assemblages, sug-\ngesting that the emplacement of the Lizard Complex\ninvolved a progressive sequence of events (cf. Jones,\n1997; Vearncombe, 1980).\n2. Geological setting of the Lizard Complex\nThe various components of the Devonian Lizard\nComplex collectively form the structurally highest,\nfault-bounded unit exposed in the late Palaeozoic\nVariscan fold and thrust belt of mainland southwest\nEngland (Holder & Leveridge, 1986). To the south,\nthe Lizard Complex structurally overlies Cambro-\nOrdovician metamorphic basement rocks (c. 500 Ma)\nwhilst to the north, it overlies mid-Devonian, very\nlow-grade metasedimentary units of the Gramscatho\nGroup (Fig. 1). All units have been tectonically dis-\nrupted by top-to-the-NNW thrusts formed during the\nmain phase of Variscan orogenesis, and these struc-\ntures are in turn cross-cut by late- to post-Variscan\nnormal faults (Power et al. 1996; Shail & Alexander,\n1997).\nThe metamorphic basement comprises two units: a\nstructurally higher Old Lizard Head Series and lower\nMan of War Gneiss (Fig. 1). The Man of War Gneiss\ncomprises a foliated sequence of dioritic, tonalitic and\nquartzo-feldspathic gneisses with relict igneous tex-\ntures that are exposed on reefs south of Lizard Point\n(Fig. 1). Sandeman et al. (1997) obtained a Cambro-\nOrdovician age (499\n+8\n\u20133 Ma; U\u2013Pb zircon concordia\nintercept age) from the Man of War Gneiss at this\nlocality which they interpreted as dating a magmatic\nprotolith. The thrust contact between the Man of War\nGneiss and the structurally overlying Old Lizard Head\nSeries is also preserved at Lizard Point (Jones, 1997).\nThe Old Lizard Head Series comprises mica schists,\ngarnet mica schists and hornblende mica schists.\nUsing SHRIMP U\u2013Pb zircon dating, Nutman et al.\n(2001) obtained ages of 499 \u00b1 7 Ma and 488 \u00b1 8 Ma\nfrom granodiorite sheets that cross-cut early fabrics in\nthe schists at Lizard Head (parts of the \u2018Lizard Head\nSill\u2019: Flett, 1946; Green, 1964c; Sandeman et al. 1997;\nC. A. Cook, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham,\n1999). This suggests that the volcano-sedimentary\nrocks of the Old Lizard Head Series formed prior to c.\n499 Ma and that they may be broadly equivalent in age\nto the Man of War Gneiss. Whole-rock geochemical\ndata (Sandeman et al. 1997; Nutman et al. 2001) sug-\ngest that these metamorphic basement rocks formed\nduring a regional episode of late Cambrian to early\nOrdovician mafic and felsic magmatism within an\nintracontinental or continental margin setting. The\ncontact between the Old Lizard Head Series and the\noverlying Landewednack amphibolites is exposed at\nPolbream Cove (Fig. 1) and has been interpreted to be\na thrust (Jones, 1997).\nThe Devonian Gramscatho Group, which is\nexposed to the north of the Lizard Complex (Fig. 1), is\ninterpreted to be a flysch sequence (Holder &\nLeveridge, 1986) comprising cleaved units of mud-\nstone with subordinate turbidite sandstones and silt-\nstones. A unit of matrix-supported m\u00e9lange up to\n1500 m thick, the Meneage m\u00e9lange, is assigned to the\nsouthernmost part of the Gramscatho Group and car-\nries clasts of mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, quartzite,\nschist and igneous rocks. Some of these clasts are\nthought to be derived from erosion of the Lizard\nComplex and associated Cambro-Ordovician meta-\nmorphic basement rocks as they were exposed in emer-\ngent thrust sheets prior to final emplacement (Holder\n& Leveridge, 1986).\nThe Lizard Complex comprises three distinct\ngroups of igneous rocks (Fig. 1; Flett & Hill, 1912;\nGreen, 1964c; Floyd, Exley & Styles, 1993): the mantle\nunits (Lizard peridotites: Cook, Holdsworth & Styles,\n1998; Cook et al. 2000), the crustal units (Traboe\nCumulate Complex, Crousa Gabbro, MORB-type\ndykes, Porthoustock amphibolites and Landewednack\namphibolites: Leake & Styles, 1984; Roberts et al.\n1993; Floyd, Exley & Styles, 1993) and later, thrust\nemplacement-related intrusions locally focused along\nthe tectonic contact between the Lizard peridotites\nand underlying metamorphic basement (Kennack\nGneiss: Green, 1964c; Sandeman et al. 1995; Jones,\n1997). Recently published U\/Pb zircon isotopic ages of\nintrusion and metamorphic events (e.g. Table 1; Clark\net al. 1998; Nutman et al. 2001) suggest that most\ncomponents in the Lizard Complex were formed and\njuxtaposed between 400 and 375 Ma. Nutman et al.\n(2001) also recently obtained c. 500 Ma zircon ages\nfrom a pelite horizon in the Landewednack amphibo-\nlites, which could indicate that the volcanosedimen-\ntary protoliths of these rocks are part of the\nCambro-Ordovician basement. However, the almost\nidentical geochemical compositions of the Landewed-\nnack amphibolites, Crousa Gabbro and dolerite dykes\nof the Lizard Complex (Kirby, 1979; Floyd, 1984;\nC. A. Cook, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham,\n1999) seems to militate against this possibility and may\n28 C. A. C O O K, R.E. H O L D S WO RT H & M. T. S T Y L E S\nsuggest that the zircon cores are inherited components\nwithin Devonian-age rocks.\nIn the mantle rocks, variably deformed and serpen-\ntinized coarse-grained spinel lherzolites are the domi-\nnant peridotite type and pass transitionally, with\nincreasing dynamic recrystallization and grain-size\nreduction into kilometre-scale domains of mylonitic\nplagioclase- and amphibole-bearing peridotites (Fig.\n1; Cook et al. 2000). Crustal rocks of the Traboe\nCumulate Complex locally display an equivalent\nmylonitic fabric and are interlayered with the\nmylonitic peridotites on the north and western mar-\ngins of the peridotite body (C. A. Cook, unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. Durham, 1999). A wide variety of rock\ntypes ranging from ultramafics such as dunites and\nclinopyroxenites through gabbros and norites to\nanorthosites (Leake & Styles, 1984) are observed in the\nTraboe Cumulate Complex. In the northeast of the\nLizard Complex, the Crousa Gabbro intrudes and\noverlies the Lizard peridotites and is locally intensely\nmylonitized (Gibbons & Thompson, 1991; Roberts \net al. 1993). Floyd, Exley & Styles (1993) demon-\nstrated that the protoliths of the Landewednack\namphibolites included mafic volcanics, tuffs, minor\ngabbros and locally discordant massive amphibo-\nlite derived from doleritic dykes. Similarly, the\nPorthoustock amphibolites are interpreted to be\nderived from highly deformed and metamorphosed\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 29\nFigure 1.

These\nintrusions are locally focused along the major contact\nbetween the Lizard peridotite and underlying meta-\nmorphic basement on the east coast of the Lizard\nPeninsula (Sandeman et al. 1995; Jones, 1997).\nBased on the association of ultramafic rocks with\nmetagabbro and metabasalt, which show many geo-\nchemical and stratigraphic similarities to ophiolitic\nsequences, the Lizard Complex has previously been\nthought to represent an ophiolite complex formed\nexclusively at a mid-ocean ridge (Bromley, 1979;\nKirby, 1979; Styles & Kirby, 1980).

A. Cook, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1999.\ntural and geochemical data, Cook et al. (2000) refined\nthis model and proposed alternatively that the Lizard\nComplex peridotites were exhumed by rifting in a con-\ntinental margin setting, prior to opening of a short-\nlived incipient ocean basin that was then inverted and\noverridden during Variscan thrusting. The findings of\nCook et al. (2000) support the results of an earlier geo-\nchemical study by Davies (1984) which suggested that\nthe Lizard oceanic crust was formed in a narrow\noceanic basin.\n3. Lizard peridotites and sub-adjacent rocks: structure\nand contact relationships\n3.a. Definition of terms\nA number of equivalent deformational and metamor-\nphic features are recognized throughout the mantle,\ncrustal and metamorphic basement rocks of the\nLizard Complex. In the present account we use the\nterm \u2018emplacement\u2019 to refer to the thrusting of mantle\nperidotites over underlying oceanic crustal rocks and\nspatially associated Cambro-Ordovician metamorphic\nbasement. Features that pre-date this event are referred\nto as \u2018pre-emplacement structures\u2019.\n3.b. Pre-emplacement structures\nA range of peridotite units form the major part of the\nLizard complex, almost all of which carry sub-vertical\nearly fabrics that formed prior to the emplacement-\nrelated deformation described below (e.g. Figs 2a, 3).\nSimilar and probably equivalent steep fabrics are also\nrecognized in adjacent parts of the Traboe cumulate\ncomplex and Landewednack amphibolites (e.g. Figs\n2b, 3) (Cook et al. 2000). The least-deformed mantle\nrocks are coarse-grained spinel- and plagioclase-bear-\ning lherzolites in which the steep fabric is defined by\nstretched orthopyroxene porphyroclasts and aligned\nspinel, olivine and recrystallized clinopyroxene. These\npass gradationally into kilometre-scale domains of\nfiner-grained plagioclase- or amphibole-bearing mylo-\nnitic peridotite (Fig. 1a). Steeply dipping foliations\nstrike mainly NNW and associated mineral lineations\nplunge down-dip (Fig. 3). These fabrics lie orthogonal\nto the regional Variscan cleavage in southwest\nEngland (e.g. Sanderson, 1984) and clearly pre-date\nthrust-related structures and fabrics (see Section 3.c).\nUsing the P\u2013T and textural history of the peridotites,\nCook et al. (2000) recently proposed that all the\nsteeply dipping fabrics were developed during high-\ntemperature (> 990 \u00b0C) shearing and exhumation of\nthe peridotites along lithosphere-scale, low-angle to\nmoderately dipping extensional shear zones during\ncontinental break-up and rifting. An extensional ori-\ngin for these fabrics correlates well with the observed\nNW\u2013SE orientation of the later MORB-type dykes\nseen throughout the Lizard Complex and with the\nNE-dipping extensional shear zones in the Crousa\nGabbro (Roberts et al. 1993). Cook et al. (2000) pro-\nposed that the presently observed steeply dipping ori-\nentation of the pre-emplacement fabrics resulted from\nrotations of regional fault blocks about horizontal\naxes during lithospheric extension prior to, or syn-\nchronous with, emplacement of the Crousa Gabbro\n(see also Roberts et al. 1993).\n3.c. Emplacement-related structures\nThree groups of emplacement-related phenomena are\nrecognized throughout the Lizard Complex:\n(1) Low-angle mylonitic shear zones (millimetre- to\ntens of metres-scale) are mainly preserved in the basal\npart of the peridotites and in up to 50 % of the under-\nlying Landewednack amphibolites. In both rock types,\nthe shear zone fabrics clearly cross-cut and rework\nsteep, often mylonitic fabrics that are thought to be\nrelated to earlier exhumation (Fig. 2b).\n(2) A syntectonic intrusive suite, the Kennack\nGneiss, which comprises mixed felsic and mafic com-\nponents, is ubiquitous in both hanging wall and foot-\nwall rocks adjacent to major shear zones that appear\nto represent the basal contacts of peridotite sheets.\nThe intrusions locally cross-cut the low-angle shear\nzones in the wall rocks, but carry a strong, low-angle\nsolid-state foliation sub-parallel to the peridotite con-\ntacts and associated mylonitic fabrics.\n(3) Gently to moderately dipping serpentine-filled\nfaults (e.g. Fig. 2c) and brittle faults cross-cut all ear-\nlier structures.\nEmplacement-related contacts separating basal\nperidotites from the underlying Landewednack amphi-\nbolites are best preserved at three localities along the\neast coast of the Lizard Peninsula (Fig. 4) (from north\nto south): Kildown Point (Fig. 5), Devils Frying-pan\n(Fig. 6) and the Balk Quarry (Fig. 7).\nAt Kildown Point (Figs 4, 5; [SW 726 147]), the\nupper part of the Landewednack amphibolites is\nexposed beneath coarse-grained lherzolites and mylo-\nnitic peridotites in a 20 m cliff section. The contact\nbetween the amphibolites and the overlying peridotite\nthrust sheet is a late, serpentine-filled fault that dips\ngently to moderately (10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0) NW, and S\u2013C fabrics\nwithin this foliated fault rock indicate a top-to-the-N\ndisplacement (Figs 2c, 5b). A narrow (30 cm) shear\nzone composed of hornblende, chlorite, anthophyllite\nand secondary serpentine \u00b1 talc immediately overlies\nthe serpentine-filled fault. The fabric in this basal peri-\ndotite shear zone dips NW at moderate angles and\nmineral stretching lineations plunge down-dip (Fig.\n5c). The sense of rotation of the earlier, pre-emplace-\nment, sub-vertical fabric in the overlying mylonitic\nperidotite into this contact shear zone is consistent\nwith a top-to-the-NW displacement.\nBelow the serpentine-filled fault occur dark green\nmylonitized Landewednack amphibolites (Fig. 2c)\nwhich are generally massive, although some composi-\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 31\ntional layering is observed, and grain-size varies\nbetween coarse- and fine-grained. The amphibolite\ncomprises variable proportions of green hornblende\nand plagioclase, with pale green epidote-rich layers\nlocally present. Foliations in the amphibolites dip at\nlow to moderate angles (10\u00b0\u201350\u00b0), predominantly to\nthe NW. Mineral lineations defined by amphibole\ncrystals plunge down-dip, predominantly towards the\nNW. Kinematic indicators (shear-bands) suggest a\ntop-to-the-NW sense of shear (Fig. 5b). Thus, the sub-\nparallel, NW-dipping fabrics in the amphibolite and\n32 C. A. C O O K, R.E. H O L D S WO RT H & M. T. S T Y L E S\nFigure 2.

These\nintrusions cross-cut fabrics in the coarse-grained lher-\nzolite, mylonitic amphibole-bearing peridotite, amphi-\nbolite and basal peridotite shear zone. The Kennack\nGneiss is foliated and lineated parallel to the NW-\ndipping fabrics in the amphibolite. The intrusions there-\nfore locally cross-cut and are deformed by emplace-\nment-related fabrics, a relationship that is consistent\nwith syntectonic emplacement. Low-angle serpentine-\nfilled faults cross-cut the Kennack Gneiss intrusions.\nAt Devils Frying-pan (Figs 4, 6; [SW 721 142]) and\non the seaward cliff to the east, a zone of gently \ndipping, anastomosing faults, 0.5\u20133 m wide, forms the\ncontact zone between the overlying peridotite sheet\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 33\nFigure 4.

Fibrous\nserpentine, tremolite\/anthophylite \u00b1 talc fills these\nfault zones, which enclose centimetre- to metre-scale\nphacoids of mylonitic peridotite, Landewednack\namphibolite and Kennack Gneiss. The faults dip NW at\nlow angles and long axes of the enclosed phacoids\nplunge towards the NW. S\u2013C fabrics and asymmetric\nwrapping of the phacoids by foliation in the serpentine-\nfilled fault zones indicate top-to-the-NW displacement\n(Fig. 6b). Evidence for earlier emplacement-related\nshear zones within the basal part of the peridotite sheet\nis almost completely obliterated by these serpentine-\n34 C. A. C O O K, R.E.

However, within several of the larger pha-\ncoids of mylonitic amphibole-bearing peridotite, pre-\nemplacement sub-vertical fabrics are reworked by\ncentimetre-scale low-angle shear zones composed of\nhornblende, chlorite and serpentine.

The logged section is oriented close to the inferred\ndirection of emplacement and is drawn with NW to the left. (c) Stereographic plots of pre-emplacement and emplacement-\nrelated foliations, mineral lineations and fold axes at Devils Frying-pan.\nThe underlying amphibolites are identical to those\nat Kildown Point. The fabric is sub-parallel to the\nbasal peridotite shear zones, with foliations dipping\nNW at low angles, and mineral stretching lineations\nplunging down-dip (Fig. 6c). Shear bands and asym-\nmetrically wrapped plagioclase porphyroclasts in the\namphibolite are consistent with a top-to-the-NW\nsense of shear. Banded felsic and mafic Kennack\nGneiss intrusions cross-cut the sub-vertical and low-\nangle fabrics in the peridotites and amphibolites, but\ncarry fabrics sub-parallel to those in the amphibolite\nand contact shear zone in the basal peridotite.\nFoliations dip at a low angle (0\u00b0\u201320\u00b0) towards the NW\nand mineral lineations plunge down-dip. The banded\ngneiss is folded, and tight folds have axes that plunge\nmainly NW at low angles to mineral lineations (Fig.\n6c).\nAt the Balk, the rocks are exposed in the old work-\n36 C. A.

The foliation of the\namphibolites dips NE at low angles and mineral\nstretching lineations plunge at low angles (0\u00b0\u20135\u00b0), pre-\ndominantly towards the NNW (Fig. 7c). Asymmetric\nplagioclase porphyroclasts in the coarse-grained layers\nsuggest a top-to-the-NNW sense of shear.\nFoliations in the coarse-grained lherzolite exposed\nin the upper level of the quarry dip steeply WSW (Fig.\n7c). A similarly oriented fabric occurs in the pre-\nemplacement-related mylonitic amphibole-bearing\nperidotite exposed lower down in the hanging wall \nsection (Fig. 7b). Gabbro and Kennack Gneiss also\nintrude these mylonitic peridotites. The contact\nbetween the coarse-grained lherzolite and the early\nmylonitic peridotite is a gently NE-dipping serpentine-\nfilled fault (Fig. 7a,b). In the cliff between the upper\nand lower levels of the quarry, an anastomosing net-\nwork of gently to moderately dipping, emplacement-\nrelated shear zones is exposed. These shear zones\ncross-cut the steep fabric in the coarse-grained lherzo-\nlite, mylonitic peridotite and gabbro, and are, in turn,\ncross-cut by intrusions of banded felsic and mafic\nKennack Gneiss. The shear zones have a mylonitic\nfabric composed of mainly hornblende and chlorite,\nwhich wraps around phacoids of peridotite and gab-\nbro. The foliation dips gently to moderately NW;\nmineral lineations, defined by elongate hornblende\ncrystals and relict augen of orthopyroxene plunge\ndown-dip (Fig. 7c). A top-to-the-NW displacement is\nindicated by asymmetric orthopyroxene porphyro-\nclasts within the shear zones and the deflection of pre-\nemplacement fabrics within the peridotites into the\nshear zone (Fig. 7b). Moderately NW-dipping late ser-\npentine-filled faults disrupt the shear zones in the\nbasal part of the peridotite sheet. Shear-sense criteria\nassociated with the faults, including asymmetric shape\nfabrics, indicate top-to-the-NW displacements (Fig.\n7b).\nApart from the three localities described here,\nemplacement-related shear zones with associated top-\nto-the-NW shear sense criteria are also preserved\nwithin the peridotites at several localities exposed\nalong the coastline, notably between Pentreath Beach\n[SW 6923 1285] and Vellan Head [SW 6680 1490].\nIn summary, emplacement-related shear zone fab-\nrics in the peridotites and Landewednack amphibo-\nlites consistently dip at low to moderate angles NW,\nwith lineations plunging NW and kinematic indicators\nshowing a top-to-the-NW sense of shear. Felsic and\nmafic intrusions of the Kennack Gneiss consistently\ncross-cut local emplacement-related structures,\nalthough they carry fabrics sub-parallel to those devel-\noped in the basal peridotite shear zones and underly-\ning Landewednack amphibolites. Detailed studies of\nfield relationships described by Sandeman et al. (1995)\nand Jones (1997) demonstrate that the Kennack\nGneisses are syn-emplacement intrusions.\nThe contact between the peridotite sheet and under-\nlying Landewednack amphibolites is typically marked\nby anastomosing serpentine-filled faults. These faults\ncontain a matrix of serpentine, which shows a ductile\nflow fabric and encloses sheared phacoids of peri-\ndotite, Landewednack amphibolite and Kennack\nGneiss. Similar serpentine, hornblende, chlorite,\nanthophyllite \u00b1 talc-filled faults also cross-cut the peri-\ndotites above and amphibolites below the contact. The\nfaults at the contact zone are oriented parallel to the\nbasal peridotite shear zones and the fabric in the\namphibolite. They dip gently to moderately NW, and\nslickenfibres and sheared phacoids are orientated\nNW\u2013SE (Figs 2c, 5\u20137). S\u2013C fabrics and the asymmet-\nric shape of phacoids demonstrate a top-to-the-NW\ndisplacement. Thus, the serpentine-filled faults are\nkinematically similar to the earlier shear zones in the\nbasal peridotites and Landewednack amphibolites.\nSerpentine-filled faults cross-cutting the peridotite\nabove the contact zone also dip NW and show top-to-\nthe-NW senses of displacement. However, they typi-\ncally dip more steeply than the faults at the base of the\nperidotites (e.g. Fig. 5b).\n4. Microstructure and metamorphism of the Lizard\nperidotites\n4.a. Pre-emplacement fabrics\nThe microstructure and metamorphic mineral assem-\nblages associated with the NNW\u2013SSE-striking, steeply\ndipping, extension-related fabrics of the Lizard peri-\ndotites are discussed in detail by Cook et al. (2000)\n(see also Table 1). In summary, variably deformed and\nserpentinized coarse-grained spinel lherzolites are the\ndominant peridotite type and pass with increasing\ndynamic recrystallization and grain-size reduction\ninto plagioclase lherzolites, transitional assemblage\nperidotites, mylonitic plagioclase- and amphibole-\nbearing peridotites. Mineral assemblages range between\nolivine + orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + spinel, in\nthe spinel lherzolite, to olivine + orthopyroxene +\nspinel \u00b1 clinopyroxene \u00b1 amphibole \u00b1 plagioclase in\nthe mylonitic peridotites.\n4.b. Emplacement-related fabrics\nIn the peridotites, the fabrics in the emplacement-\nrelated shear zones are defined by aligned grains of\nfine-grained colourless magnesio-hornblende and\nchlorite forming narrow (~ 0.5 mm wide) anastomos-\ning shear band networks (Table 1). The hornblende\nand chlorite grains usually possess well-defined crys-\ntallographic- and shape-preferred orientations parallel\nto the margins of the shear bands. The shear bands\nasymmetrically wrap around relict orthopyroxene and\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 37\n38 C. A. C O O K, R.E. H O L D S WO RT H & M. T. S T Y L E S\nFigure 8.

Pull-apart frac-\ntures and clinopyroxene exsolution lamellae within\nrelict orthopyroxene porphyroclasts are filled with\nhornblende. Brittle fractured clasts at margins of por-\nphyroclasts are also enveloped in growths of fibrous\ncolourless hornblende. The development of amphi-\nbole is therefore inferred to be synkinematic and \nsuggests the infiltration of a hydrous fluid and its\ninteraction with the pre-existing peridotite mineral\nassemblage (e.g. see examples discussed by Drury,\nHoogerduijn Strating & Vissers, 1990; Bailey,\nHoldsworth & Swarbrick, 2000). Fine-grained chlorite\nusually occupies the central portion of these shear\nbands and develops a fabric that overprints the amphi-\nbole fabric, asymmetrically wrapping amphibole por-\nphyroclasts (Fig. 8b). The amphiboles are tremolite\nand tremolitic hornblende to magnesio-hornblende\n(C. A. Cook, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham,\n1999; amphibole names according to the IMA classifi-\ncation of Leake et al. 1997) The stability of olivine,\nchlorite and tremolite to magnesio-hornblende in the\nshear zones and the breakdown of wall-rock spinel to\nmagnetite + chlorite suggest temperatures between\n500 and 800 \u00b0C (Evans et al. 1976; Oba, 1980).\n5. Microstructure and metamorphism of the\nLandewednack amphibolites\n5.a. Pre-emplacement fabrics\nThe Landewednack amphibolites do not preserve\noriginal primary igneous mineral assemblages, al-\nthough a weak compositional banding defined by \nthe metamorphic minerals (Fig. 8c) may represent a\nrelict primary igneous layering. The earliest metamor-\nphic mineral assemblage in the Landewednack amphi-\nbolites defines NNW\u2013SSE-striking, steeply dipping\nfabrics (Fig. 3a) that are interpreted to have developed\nprior to the thrust emplacement of the Lizard\nComplex and synchronously with the extension-\nrelated fabrics of the peridotites. It is distinguished by\nthe presence of brown amphibole in association with\nrelict clinopyroxene and plagioclase (Fig. 8c\u2013e). Relict\nclinopyroxene occurs as \u2018corroded\u2019 anhedral porphy-\nroclasts, and minor brown amphiboles are common as\na secondary replacement mineral assemblage along\ncleavage planes. Further evidence for the breakdown\nof clinopyroxene to brown amphibole includes the\npresence of diffuse brown amphibole rims around\nclinopyroxene.\n5.b. Emplacement-related fabrics\nThe first metamorphic mineral assemblage thought to\nbe related to thrust emplacement is distinguished by\nthe appearance of green amphibole and titanite (Fig.\n8d,e). This is the dominant metamorphic assemblage\nand is typical of the amphibolites with gently to mod-\nerately dipping fabrics. The green amphibole + titan-\nite-bearing assemblage may partially or wholly replace\nthe brown amphibole-bearing assemblage. Evidence\nfor retrogression of the brown amphibole-bearing\nassemblage is seen where fine-grained green amphi-\nbole grains surround porphyroclasts of brown amphi-\nbole or where brown amphiboles have green rims. In\nmany samples, the only evidence for an earlier assem-\nblage is the presence of green amphiboles with relict\nbrown cores (e.g. Fig. 8e). Relict clinopyroxene por-\nphyroclasts are common and are always rimmed by\ngreen amphibole, which may define asymmetric por-\nphyroclast shapes (e.g. Fig. 8d). Minor minerals that\noccur in this metamorphic assemblage include rare\nbiotite and opaque minerals.\nClose to the contact with the overlying peridotite\nsheet, a later metamorphic mineral assemblage is\nfound within cross-cutting shear zones in the Land-\newednack amphibolite. This metamorphic assemblage\nis characterized by the presence of colourless horn-\nblende (Fig. 8f). It occurs as weakly aligned fibrous\nlaths that rim earlier clinopyroxenes, brown amphi-\nboles or green amphiboles. The hornblende also hosts\nnarrow cross-cutting shear zones that may wrap\naround relict porphyroclasts of the pre-existing min-\neral assemblages (Fig. 8f). Epidote veinlets cross-cut\nall mineral assemblages and other later, retrogressive,\nassemblages include chlorite and prehnite.\n6. Discussion\n6.a. Pre-emplacement events and their regional context\nGiven the presence of similar pre-emplacement fabrics\nin the peridotites and Landewednack amphibolites, it\nseems reasonable to suggest that the metamorphism of\nthese units was closely related. Cook et al. (2000)\nrecently demonstrated that initial upper mantle equili-\nbration of spinel lherzolite took place at high pressure\n(c. 16 kbar) and high temperature (c. 1120 \u00b0C). This\nwas followed by progressive re-equilibration during\nformation of the following rock types: plagioclase\nlherzolite (c. 11 kbar, 1070 \u00b0C), transitional assem-\nblage peridotite (c. 7.5 kbar, 1020 \u00b0C), mylonitic pla-\ngioclase-bearing peridotite (c. 7.5 kbar, 1010 \u00b0C) and\nmylonitic amphibole-bearing peridotite (c. 7.5 kbar,\n990 \u00b0C).

Durham,\n1999) showed that metamorphism of the brown\namphibole + plagioclase metamorphic mineral assem-\nblage in the Landewednack amphibolites took place at\n550\u2013700 \u00b0C and 2\u20136 kbar. Nutman et al. (2001)\nrecently presented SHRIMP\u00e4 U\u2013Pb isotopic ages of\nc. 393 Ma and 386 Ma for metamorphic zircons in\nLandewednack amphibolites that display steep fabrics\nand a brown amphibole + plagioclase metamorphic\nmineral assemblage (Table 1). These ages are inter-\npreted to record metamorphism and recrystallization\nof the amphibolites that occurred c. 390 Ma as they\ncame into contact with the adjacent relatively hot peri-\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 39\ndotites during exhumation and displacement along a\nlow-angle to moderately dipping extensional shear\nzone during rifting in a continental margin setting.\nThis model would require that the Landewednack\namphibolites lay in the hanging wall of the extensional\nshear zone, whilst the peridotites were part of the\nexhumed footwall. The P\u2013T data discussed above also\nimply that prograde metamorphism of the Land-\newednack amphibolites occurred relatively late in the\nexhumation history of peridotites prior to thrust\nemplacement. This interpretation is similar to some\naspects of the models developed for Zabargad Island,\nRed Sea (Nicolas, Boudier & Montigny, 1987; Boudier\net al. 1988) and Sierra Alpujata, southern Spain\n(Tubia & Cuevas, 1987).\nOn the basis of field and textural data, P\u2013T esti-\nmates and geochemistry, Cook et al. (2000) proposed\nthat the NE\/ENE\u2013SW\/WSW-stretching of the lithos-\npheric mantle occurred near to a small incipient\noceanic basin in either an extensional or transten-\nsional setting, rather than at a mid-ocean ridge.\nPrevious studies (e.g. Gibbons & Thompson, 1991;\nRoberts et al. 1993) had suggested that deformation in\nthe Crousa Gabbro occurred during amagmatic exten-\nsion around a spreading centre. Cook et al. (2000) sup-\nported an extensional setting, but proposed that the\ngeological history of the Lizard preserves a more grad-\nual evolution between earlier lithospheric extension in\nthe sub-continental mantle through to the later devel-\nopment of oceanic crust. In common with several\nother authors (e.g. Badham, 1982; Barnes & Andrews,\n1986; Holdsworth, 1989; Cook et al. 2000) we prefer to\nbelieve that the rocks of the Lizard Complex were\nformed in a local pull-apart basin (Fig. 9). The pre-\nemplacement NNW\u2013SSE-striking foliations and\ndown-dip stretching lineations in the mylonitic peri-\ndotites, Landewednack amphibolites and deformed\nTraboe cumulates suggest ENE\u2013WSW extension and\ncorrespond well with the NW\u2013SE orientation of mafic\ndykes throughout the Lizard Complex and NE-dip-\nping extensional shear zones in the Crousa Gabbro\n(Roberts et al. 1993; Cook et al. 2000). All these fea-\ntures seem to be most consistent with a local pull-\napart basin developed along an E\u2013W-oriented zone of\nright-lateral shear (Fig. 9), an increasingly recognized\ntectonic component of the pre-Variscan and Variscan\nevolution of southwest England and Europe (e.g.\nBarnes & Andrews, 1984). Oceanic, MORB-type\nrocks are also recognized in the Start Complex of\nDevon (Holdsworth, 1989; Floyd, Holdsworth &\nSteele, 1993) south of the E\u2013W-trending Start\u2013\nPerranporth line (Fig. 1b), a structure that coincides\nwith the northern margin of the Gramscatho Basin\nacross Cornwall. The Start\u2013Perranporth line is defined\nby an anomalous, narrow zone of Variscan dextral\ntranspression that Holdsworth (1989) proposed\nformed due to oblique collision against a pre-existing,\nE\u2013W-trending dextral fault zone which formed the\nnorthern margin of a domain of pull-apart basins,\nlocally floored by oceanic crust, in the region separat-\ning eastern Avalonia (e.g. southwest England north of\nthe Start\u2013Perranporth line) and Armorica (e.g. the\nNormannian Nappe).\nThe proposal that the c. 500 Ma zircons in the\nmetapelite horizon in the Landewednack amphibolites\n(Nutman et al. 2001) are inherited is extremely signifi-\ncant as it suggests a close spatial association between\nthe oceanic crust formed in the pull-apart basin and\nthe Cambro-Ordovician continental basement unit\n(Old Lizard Head Series and Man of War Gneiss). It is\n40 C. A. C O O K, R.E. H O L D S WO RT H & M. T. S T Y L E S\nFigure 9.

The basin is shown lying to the\nsouth of an E\u2013W-trending dextral regional shear zone\nthought to correspond to the present-day position of the\nStart\u2013Perranporth Line (see Fig. 1b for location). Rifting is\nassociated with the development of a lithosphere-scale,\nENE-dipping extensional shear zone thought to be responsi-\nble for the rapid exhumation of the mantle peridotites, the\ndevelopment of a localized oceanic basin and the juxtaposi-\ntion of the peridotites with oceanic crust (Landewednack\namphibolites) to produce the early brown amphibole-bear-\ning mineral assemblage. The basin is shown in its most\nmature state immediately prior to basin closure, inversion\nand ophiolite obduction during top-to-the-NW Variscan\nthrusting (see Fig. 10a,b).

Emplacement-related events\nThe subsequent NNW-directed closure of the pull-\napart basin, tectonic inversion and emplacement of\nthe Lizard Complex are recorded by the dismember-\nment of the various units by shallow-dipping detach-\nment faults and shear zones (Fig. 10a,b). Sandeman et\nal. (1995) demonstrated by thermobarometry of pla-\ngioclase\u2013amphibole pairs that metamorphism of the\npredominant, \u2018hot\u2019 emplacement-related green amphi-\nbole + plagioclase assemblage of the Landewednack\namphibolite took place at c. 600 \u00b0C, ~ 3\u20134 kbar and\nobtained 40Ar\/39Ar incremental heating dates of\n360\u2013370 Ma for amphibole. More recently, Cook\n(unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1999) pro-\nvided geothermometry estimates of 500\u2013650 \u00b0C and\n3\u20135.5 kbar for the metamorphism of the Landewed-\nnack amphibolites adjacent to the basal peridotites.\nInterpretations of SHRIMP \u00e4 U\u2013Pb isotopic dates by\nNutman et al. (2001) for zircons and monazites and a\nU\u2013Pb single-zircon date by Sandeman et al. (2000)\nfrom the Kennack Gneiss suggest that syntectonic\ngranite emplacement took place from 396 to 376 Ma\n(Table 1). Nutman et al. (2001) suggest that both the \nc. 369 Ma Rb\u2013Sr isochron date for a felsic vein of the\nKennack Gneiss (Styles & Rundle, 1984) and the c. 370\nMa 40Ar\/39Ar incremental heating dates for horn-\nblendes in the mafic components of the Kennack\nGneiss (Sandeman et al. 1995) may record the ongoing\nmetamorphism associated with the thrust-related\nemplacement of the Lizard Complex (Fig. 10a).\nThe origin of the Kennack Gneiss is controversial\n(see Sandeman et al. 2000). Sanders (1955), Styles &\nKirby (1980) and Malpas & Langdon (1987) proposed\nderivation following melting of the Old Lizard Head\nEmplacement of Lizard Complex peridotites 41\nFigure 10.

In contrast,\nTeall (1887), Flett & Hill (1912), Green (1964c),\nBromley (1979) and Sandeman et al. (1995, 2000) sug-\ngested that the Kennack Gneiss was derived from\nmixed mafic and felsic magmas intruded syntectoni-\ncally in proximity to the base of the Lizard Complex.\nThe latter intrusion model seems more likely, because\nthe P\u2013T estimates recorded in the Landewednack\namphibolites (Sandeman et al. 1995; C. A. Cook,\nunpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1999) suggest that\nsyn-emplacement temperatures were unlikely to be\nhigh enough to have led to melting. In addition,\nSandeman et al. (2000) and Nutman et al. (2001)\nobserved that the protolith for the felsic component of\nthe Kennack Gneiss includes much older zircons (490\nMa to 1712 Ma), consistent with deeper melting of a\nunit of older continental crustal material structurally\nunderlying the Lizard Complex (Fig. 9b). Sandeman\net al. (2000) also demonstrated that the mafic com-\nponent of the Kennack Gneiss is comparable to\nEMORB and probably generated through partial\nmelting of a weakly enriched mantle source, and not\nanatexis of the Landewednack amphibolites as sug-\ngested by earlier studies.\nAlthough the basal peridotite shear zones and\nLandewednack amphibolites of the Lizard Complex\ndisplay some features in common with the metamor-\nphic soles of ophiolite complexes, there are also sev-\neral major differences. One of these is the lack of an\ninverted metamorphic field gradient, from granulite\nfacies down to greenschist facies, within the Land-\newednack amphibolites underlying the peridotites. If\nit ever existed, this gradient must have been omitted\ndue to the effects of thrust-related imbrication or late\nVariscan extensional faulting in the thrust sheets.\nHowever, it seems more likely that the apparent\nabsence of an inverted metamorphic gradient may\nreflect the polyphase metamorphic history of the\nLandewednack amphibolites in the footwall. Our\nobservations suggest that the early, relatively high-\ntemperature, NNW\u2013SSE-striking, steeply dipping fab-\nrics in the amphibolites can be broadly correlated with\nsimilar structures in the peridotites where they are\ninterpreted as having formed prior to emplacement\nduring rifting and exhumation of the mantle (Fig. 9;\nTable 1; Cook et al. 2000). The subsequent develop-\nment of the predominant green amphibole + plagio-\nclase and later, lower-temperature mineral assemblages\nin the Landewednack amphibolites during subsequent\n\u2018hot\u2019 and later \u2018cold\u2019 thrust emplacement of the Lizard\nperidotites (Fig. 10a,b; Table 1) therefore both rep-\nresent retrograde metamorphic assemblages. These\nappear to contrast with the predominantly prograde\nassemblages found within the metamorphic soles of\nmost ophiolites (however, see Jamieson, 1986).\nThe basal shear zones in the Lizard peridotites related\nto top-to-the-NW thrust emplacement are characterized\nby a relatively low-temperature (500\u2013800 \u00b0C) mineral\nassemblage composed of tremolite to magnesio-horn-\nblende and chlorite. This contrasts with the higher-tem-\nperature (900\u20131000 \u00b0C) orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene\nand olivine \u00b1 Ti-pargasite assemblages observed in the\nbasal peridotite mylonites of many ophiolites (Malpas,\n1979; Girardeau, 1982; Suhr & Cawood, 1993). We\npropose that the reduced temperatures reflect cooling\nof the mantle rocks, following extension and prior to\ntheir subsequent \u2018hot\u2019 emplacement.\nThe serpentine associated with later emplacement-\nrelated faults consists of a pale to dark green, pseudo-\nfibrous mixture of lizardite and chrysotile, and\nsuggests relatively low temperatures between\n20\u2013250 \u00b0C (Power et al. 1997). These faults probably\nformed during the final stages of \u2018hot\u2019 emplacement or\nmay have been active right up to the final \u2018cold\u2019\nemplacement of the Lizard Complex over the\nGramscatho Group to the north. However, Power et\nal. (1997) suggest that vein serpentine infills of later\nhigh-angle faults post-date emplacement.\n6.c. Post-emplacement events\nThe present-day geometry of the emplacement-related\ncontacts is NW-dipping (e.g. Fig. 1c). If top-to-the-\nNW thrusting were responsible for the emplacement\nof the peridotite sheet, a SE-dipping contact zone\nwould be expected, as demonstrated, for example, by\nemplacement-related fabrics in the metamorphic base-\nment rocks of the Old Lizard Head Series at Lizard\nPoint (Jones, 1997). This suggests that the contact\nzone, together with the overlying peridotite sheet and\nunderlying Landewednack amphibolites, have been\nrotated from a SE-dipping orientation to the present\nday NW-dipping attitude. It is suggested that this\nreorientation occurred due to post-emplacement fault-\nblock rotation facilitated by displacement along later,\nmainly NE\u2013SW-striking, steeply dipping normal\nfaults (e.g. Power et al. 1996). This later rotation would\nnot significantly reorient the steeply dipping, pre-\nemplacement foliation in the Lizard Complex as the\ninferred subhorizontal NE\u2013SW rotation axes lie at\nhigh angles to the NNW\u2013SSE strike of these planar\nfabrics (e.g. Fig. 3). It is also possible that some low-\nangle movements along the serpentinized fault zones\nmay have occurred during late Variscan reactivation of\npre-existing thrust faults and fabrics during exten-\nsional collapse of the thrust nappe (e.g. Jones, 1997;\nShail & Alexander, 1997). Extensional collapse of a\nthrust wedge also accounts for the development of late\nextensional fault systems in the Bay of Islands\nComplex (Fergusson & Cawood, 1995).\n7. Conclusions\nThe peridotites and Landewednack amphibolites of\nthe Lizard Complex experienced at least four phases of\n42 C. A. C O O K, R.E. H O L D S WO RT H & M. T. S T Y L E S\ndeformation and associated metamorphism together\nwith an episode of syntectonic magmatism. Steep \nfabrics in the peridotites and amphibolites were devel-\noped during NE\/ENE\u2013SW\/WSW extension associ-\nated with the earlier exhumation of the Lizard\nperidotites in an extensional or transtensional conti-\nnental margin setting (Fig. 9). Juxtaposition of newly\nformed oceanic crust with the hot peridotites at this\ntime, possibly across an extensional shear zone, pro-\nduced an early, prograde, brown amphibole-bearing\nmetamorphic assemblage in the Landewednack\namphibolites.\nLater, thrust emplacement-related shear zones and\nassociated mylonitic fabrics in the Lizard peridotite\nunit and underlying Landewednack amphibolites\ncross-cut the earlier steep fabrics. These structures\npresently dip at low to moderate angles NW, with\ndown-dip lineations and kinematic indicators showing\ntop-to-the-NW senses of shear that formed during\nthrusting of the peridotite sheet over the\nLandewednack amphibolites in a partially intra-\noceanic setting (Fig. 10a). Two retrograde meta-\nmorphic mineral assemblages recognized in the\nLandewednack amphibolites are interpreted to record\ndown-temperature phases of deformation and meta-\nmorphism during overthrusting of the Lizard\nComplex. These are defined by the presence of green\namphibole + titanite, and colourless hornblende,\nrespectively. At least one of these retrogressive phases\nis also recognized in narrow shear zones developed in\nthe overlying peridotites. Syntectonic magmatism is\nrecorded by the cross-cutting intrusions of the foliated\nKennack Gneiss (Fig. 10a). Anastomosing serpentine-\nfilled faults mark the existing low-angle contacts\nbetween the peridotites and Landewednack amphibo-\nlites. The serpentine-filled faults are kinematically\ncompatible with the earlier shear zones in the basal\nperidotites and Landewednack amphibolites and may\nhave formed during the transition from \u2018hot\u2019 to \u2018cold\u2019\nemplacement in which the Lizard Complex was finally\nthrust northwards over the Gramscatho Group (Fig.\n10b; Barnes & Andrews, 1984). The original thrust\ncontact between the Lizard Complex and the\nGramscatho Group is nowhere preserved due to the\neffects of later extensional faulting.\nThe present study shows that metamorphic soles\nmay record early juxtaposition of hotter mantle and\ncooler crustal rocks during extension-related phases of\ndeformation that pre-date ophiolite emplacement dur-\ning collisional overthrusting. Similar deformational\nand metamorphic histories may be preserved in meta-\nmorphic soles associated with other orogenic peri-\ndotite massifs and ophiolites elsewhere in the world\n(e.g. Searle & Malpas, 1980; Boudier, Ceuleneer &\nNicolas, 1988; Fergusson & Cawood, 1995).\nAcknowledgements.
