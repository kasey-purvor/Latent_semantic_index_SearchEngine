Th e latter did not happen. \nIn fulfilment of this \u201csunrise clause\u201d, the Agreement between the United \nNations and the Lebanese Republic as well as the Statute of the Special \nTribunal for Lebanon (STL-Statute) therefore automatically entered into \nforce on that date.1 Th e process of the practical establishment of the Tribu-\nnal was already under way in late 2007. It will be exclusively tasked with \nprosecuting persons responsible for high-level terrorist attacks in Lebanon \nsince the end of 2004. Th e main event to be prosecuted is the assassination \nof the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri2 in early 2005, which \nis the reason why the Tribunal is also referred to as the \u201cHariri-Tribunal\u201d. \nOther regional issues of potential relevance for international criminal law, \nsuch as e.g. the so-called \u201csummer war\u201d between Israel and the Hezbollah \nin Lebanon in August 2006, will not be subject to juridical scrutiny by the \nTribunal. Th is armed conflict lasted over 30 days, cost the lives of approxi-\nmately 1200 persons on the Lebanese and approximately 150 on the Israeli \nside and was only ended by Security Council Resolution 1701 (2007).3  \n II. Background \n On 14 February 2005 Rafik Hariri and 22 others were killed, approxi-\nmately 220 injured, and the wider surrounding area severely damaged in a \nmassive explosion in Beirut. Approximately 1,800 kilograms of TNT deto-\nnated inside a parked Mitsubishi van as his convoy passed. Th e assassina-\ntion caused massive demonstrations in Lebanon and eventually led to the \n1)  Th e Agreement and the Statute are annexed to SC Res. 1757 (2007) of 30 May 2007. \n2)  Hariri had resigned as Prime Minister in October 2004. \n3)  On this issue, see Ch.

Early allegations as to the responsibil-\nity for the attack involved, inter alia, Syrian and Lebanese security agencies \nand led to the arrest of four high-ranking members of the Lebanese \nmilitary on 30 August 2005.7 Syria strongly denied any involvement. \nIn January 2006 Mehlis was succeeded by the Belgian Serge Brammertz, \nwho until 2007 also was a Deputy Prosecutor at the International Crimi-\nnal Court (ICC).8 In subsequent reports of the IIIC Brammertz declared \nto have identified \u201ca number of persons\u201d,9 but declined to name specific \nsuspects or witnesses for reasons of security and in order not to prejudge \npossible court proceedings in the future.10 According to findings released \nso far it appears that the bombing itself was carried out by a young male \n 4)  Th ese had been stationed in Lebanon since the civil war of 1975 to 1989.

One week later the Lebanese \ncabinet minister Pierre Gemayel was shot on the street in Beirut. On the \nsame day, just a few hours after the shooting, the Security Council approved \nthe tribunal as proposed.17 Hence, the legal framework of the Tribunal was \nfinalized within less than two years after the underlying events had hap-\npened and within one year after the basic decision had been taken by the \nSecurity Council. \n11)  However, the person claiming responsibility in a video, Ahmed Abu Adass, is seen as likely \nbeing neither the bomber nor the instigator of the attack; see 7th Report of the IIIC of 15 March \n2007, UN Doc.

Th e constitu-\ntionality of the respective acts of the Lebanese government, headed by \nPrime Minister Fouad Siniora, has been questioned, since the cabinet was \npartially depleted by resignations of six ministers, among these all Shi\u2019ite \nones; the President of Lebanon Emile Lahoud challenged the government\u2019s \napproval on the grounds that the cabinet had thus lost its \u201clegitimacy\u201d,18 \nand claimed that according to the Lebanese constitution all international \nagreements must also be reviewed by him.19 In any event, these acts had \nnot gone through the complete constitutional process.20 Since the agree-\nment would have functioned as an international treaty between the UN \nand Lebanon, it still needed the approval by that State\u2019s parliament in order \nto enter into force. \n During the following months the Lebanese parliament was unable to do \nso. As part of the political crisis that ensued in Lebanon between the gov-\nernment and the Hezbollah-led opposition after November 2006, the \nSpeaker of Parliament Nabih Berri did not convene a session, thereby in \neffect preventing the majority of government Members of Parliament to \napprove the agreement. Th ese even called on the newly elected Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon to initiate the establishment \nof the Tribunal by a binding resolution under Chapter VII of the UN \n18)  Th e main aspects of the division of power between the different confessions are laid down \nin the Taef (Saudi Arabia) Accord of 22 October 1989. According to this document, parliament \nis to be divided equally between Christians and Muslims (section II, B, 6). Concerning the \ndecision-making on the STL-Agreement within the cabinet, the remaining 18 ministers out of a \ntotal of 24 still provided for the constitutional quorum of two thirds. Th e Taef Accord is silent \non the question of the distribution of power among the different muslim factions.

At first, Ban Ki-moon \nhad preferred a consensual agreement;22 but he soon changed his mind \nafter subsequent attempts to break the stalemate had failed, including visits \nby himself to the region in April 2007. In addition, the Lebanese Prime \nMinister Siniora had called on the Security Council to take action.23 All of \nthis prompted the passing of UNSC Resolution 1757 in May 2007, when \nthe United States held the Presidency of the Security Council.24  \n III. Legal Character of the Special Tribunal \n A. Hybrid Tribunals in International Criminal Law \n Th e Special Tribunal for Lebanon belongs to the relatively recent category \nof hybrid international criminal tribunals.25 As their most notable distinc-\ntive elements, these tribunals provide for mixtures of national and interna-\ntional staff, including the judges, as well as of the applicable law. Th ey also \ndiffer from the \u201ctraditional\u201d international criminal tribunals of modern \ntimes \u2013 namely the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC \u2013 in their mode of \nestablishment, in the location of their seat and in the way in which they are \nfinanced. It is not easy to categorize hybrid tribunals due to their varying \nforms and degrees of mixture of these national and international elements. \nOne possibility would be to distinguish between hybrid tribunals set up \n21)  See \u201cBan Ki-moon receives Lebanese memo on planned tribunal for Hariri killing\u201d, UN \nNews Centre, 4 April 2007. \n22)  See Interview with AP, International Herald Tribune, 26 April 2007. \n23)  See Letter to the Security Council of 16 May 2007, UN Doc. S\/2007\/281. \n24)  SC Res. 1757 (2007) was passed with a vote of 10 to 0, with China, Indonesia, Qatar, Russia, \nand South Africa abstaining. Th e resolution had been sponsored by Belgium, France, Italy, Slo-\nvakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n25)  See generally, K. Ambos \/ M. Othmann (eds.), New Approaches in International Criminal \nJustice: Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Cambodia (Freiburg 2003); C. Romano \/ A. Nol-\nlkaemper \/ J. Kleffner (eds.), Internationalized Criminal Courts \u2013 Sierra Leone, East Timor, \nKosovo, and Cambodia (Oxford 2004); T. Kuosmanen, Bringing Justice Closer: Hybrid Courts \nin Post-Conflict Societies (Helsinki 2007). \nWetzel and Mitri \/ \n Th e Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 7 (2008) 81\u2013114 87\nwithin or outside of a national legal framework.26 An alternative approach \nwould be to divide hybrid tribunals into three sub-categories according to \ntheir respective legal bases: first, tribunals within UN-administrations, \nsuch as the internationalized panels in Kosovo and Timor-Leste, whose \nauthority ultimately stems from the Security Council resolutions establish-\ning the peacekeeping operations; second, tribunals set up on the bases of \nbilateral agreements, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), \nthe Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) and pos-\nsibly a future Special Chamber for Burundi;27 and third, tribunals set up \nessentially as domestic courts by national law, which however contain a \nconsiderable degree of international impetus, such as the War Crimes \nChambers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, respectively, as well as \nthe Iraqi Special Tribunal.28 \n Th e Secretary-General has characterized the Tribunal, which was origi-\nnally planned to be treaty-based, as an international one, since the ele-\nments in this regard outweighed the national ones.29 For example, it \ndeviates from most of the other hybrid tribunals in that it operates outside \nof the national system of justice, matched only by the SCSL. Th e govern-\nment of Lebanon will have the duty to cooperate with the Tribunal, which \nwill have primacy over domestic court proceedings concerning crimes \nwithin its jurisdiction.30 Now that it was directly created by the Security \nCouncil, no doubt remains as to its international character. But it was not \nsupposed to be a UN-tribunal either. While being set up with the support \nof the United Nations and for a specific situation of the past, making it \nanother ad hoc-tribunal, it was designed to be independent from that insti-\ntution. Only the Registrar of the Tribunal will be a UN staff member, as it \n26)  Comp. S.

As a further important element, the Tribunal shall \nespecially be independent from the Security Council. For example, during \nthe negotiations Russia had proposed to let the judges be appointed by the \nSecurity Council which however would have given a veto-power \u2013 and \nhence considerable influence \u2013 to its five permanent Members. Th is pro-\nposal was eventually rejected.32  \n B. Th e Competence of the Security Council to Establish the Tribunal as a \nMeasure to Restore International Peace and Security \n As mentioned before, at the outset the Tribunal had been planned to be a \ntreaty-based tribunal. At present, this seems to be the preferred method of \nsetting up new international criminal tribunals, since, among other rea-\nsons, hybrid tribunals are hoped to lead to an increase in support for jurid-\nical prosecutions within the affected population, while decreasing the \nfinancial burden on the United Nations.33 But in the end the base of the \nTribunal\u2019s creation is a resolution of the UN Security Council. Th e deci-\nsion to pass a Chapter VII resolution on the subject was controversial and \nlargely centred on the classification of the attacks on Rafik Hariri and the \nother victims as terrorist activities of international concern. It would be \nbeyond the scope of this paper to re-examine the present discussion on \nterrorism in international law in its full complexity; in contrast, the follow-\ning observations will address only two issues relevant in this regard, namely \nterrorism as a threat to international peace and security under Article 39 \nof the UN Charter, and terrorism as an international crime,34 without \nattempting to resolve these questions completely. \n Politically, the supporters of the approach to create the Tribunal by a \nSecurity Council resolution stressed the fact that all options for a consen-\n31)  Comp.

First, it remains doubtful what prac-\ntical difference the supporters of this approach envisaged. Second, although \nit is true that the Security Council can make binding decisions outside of \nChapter VII,38 these can, according to the prevailing interpretation of Arti-\ncle 25 of the UN Charter, nevertheless only have a binding effect if they are \nmade in accordance with the Charter.39 Th is interpretation is based on the \n35)  See \u201cRevised U.N.

Th is \napproach takes into account that with a view to Article 2(5) of the UN \nCharter, which can be read as allowing States not to assist the United \nNations in actions not in accordance with the Charter, a second statement \nin Article 25, which would merely be aimed towards an obligation of the \nMember States to carry out decisions of the Security Council in accord-\nance with the Charter would be superfluous.40 Hence, Article 25 of the \nUN Charter does not serve as a general norm of authorisation, but clarifies \nthat also the Security Council must observe the general principle as laid \ndown in Article 2(5) and hence that its resolutions are only binding if they \nare achieved according to the procedure provided for in the Charter. In the \npresent case the applicable procedure is actually the one provided for in \nChapter VII of the UN Charter. \n It is generally accepted by now that the creation of international crimi-\nnal tribunals falls within the Security Council\u2019s mandate of securing inter-\nnational peace and security.41 It is true that the ICTY and ICTR were \ncreated under different circumstances, namely with regard to serious viola-\ntions of international humanitarian law, involving hundreds of thousands \nof victims killed. Still, the creation of this Special Tribunal also falls within \nthe Council\u2019s mandate. First, the concept of a threat to the peace in the \nsense of Article 39 of the UN Charter was deliberately phrased in an inde-\nterminate, broad way which is open to interpretation, in order to give lee-\nway to the Security Council.42 Th e Security Council itself had declared \nHariri\u2019s assassination to be a terrorist act and a threat to international peace \nand security.43 Hereby, it reiterated its former declarations that terrorism \n40)  J.

Instead, there had been other targets and motives behind those acts, \npresumably the destabilization of the whole region.46 \n Second, to make the number of casualties the decisive factor would lead \nto the arbitrary question where exactly to draw the line between national \nand international prosecutions.

One major line of argu-\nment concerning the authority of the Security Council to create ad hoc-\ntribunals is the attempt to break the circle of violence within long-lasting \nconflicts and thereby to forgo the resumption of hostilities in the future. \nTh is rationale also seems to be applicable to the conflict in Lebanon. \n Th ird, a Chapter VII resolution is generally warranted in cases of inter-\nnational criminal prosecutions, where the assistance of third states is neces-\nsary, e.g. with regard to the handing over of suspects or evidence.49 In the \npresent case, Res. 1757 (2007) failed to explicitly establish any obligation \nfor third states, especially for Syria, despite the proposal of the Secretary-\nGeneral.50 However, only a resolution under Chapter VII, which is capable \nof justifying an intervention in the domestic affairs of a Member State, \notherwise prohibited by Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, could also bind \nLebanon directly. Res. 1757 (2007) thereby effectively put an end to the \nLebanese debate over the constitutionality of the Tribunal.51 Hence, the \nprohibition of interference in domestic affairs by the UN, as laid down in \nArticle 2(7) of its Charter, was not a bar, but a reason for the passing of \nRes. 1757 (2007). \n Fourth, while the process of parliamentary approval of an international \ntreaty can be seen as such a matter that is essentially within the domestic \njurisdiction of a State, the precedents concerning international prosecu-\ntions of crimes of interest to the wider State community also point towards \na resolution under Chapter VII. Not only were the ICTY and the ICTR \nestablished in such a manner;52 also the so-called \u201cLockerbie-Trials\u201d con-\ncerning the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988, which \nwere conducted by Scottish judges on Dutch territory between 1999 and \n2001, were authorized by a resolution under Chapter VII.53 Another inci-\n49)  Comp.

Th is would then \ntrigger a collective response, in this case by the UN Security Council. \n Th ese considerations lead to the overall conclusion that the UN Security \nCouncil acted lawfully when it passed Res. 1757 (2007). Th is is also evi-\ndenced by the fact that despite alleged legal reservations, no Member State \nof the Security Council voted against it.

Th e Special Tribunal as a Resolution-Based Tribunal \n Since the Security Council created the Tribunal directly, for the first time \nsince the establishment of the ICTY and the ICTR, it is closer to the group \nof resolution-based tribunals. Th us, the Tribunal is more than just another \n\u201cUN-backed\u201d tribunal.58 First, the Tribunal can now only be terminated \nby the Security Council. Second, a tribunal created under Chapter VII \ngenerally has greater authority to request international cooperation from \nthird States. A bilateral agreement cannot create binding obligations for \nthird States,59 unless the Security Council adopts a supporting resolution \nunder Chapter VII.60 However, in practise Chapter VII powers alone do \nnot always ensure cooperation either, as this depends more on the political \nwill of the respective state and the possibilities of enforcement on the part \nof the institution.61 As already indicated, the STL-Statute does not explic-\nitly provide for obligations of third States to cooperate with it.62 Th is is due \nto the original approach to establish the Tribunal by a bilateral treaty. \nWhen the Tribunal was eventually established by Res. 1757 (2007) instead, \nonly the provisions of that draft agreement were put into force, without \nadditional language requesting outside cooperation besides provision of a \nseat and contributions to the budget. Th is may be seen as a major short-\ncoming of the Tribunal.63 However, as the example of the SCSL shows, this \n58)  Th e Secretary-General seems to prefer the term \u201cUN-assisted tribunal\u201d in his report; however, \n\u201cUN-based\u201d is also used (supra n. 29, para. 17). \n59)  Comp.

While Syria has recently cooper-\nated with the IIIC to the general satisfaction of its Commissioner,66 it has \nstated it would not cooperate with the Tribunal. It remains to be seen \nwhether Syria will cling to this attitude. \n Th e greatest disadvantage of the present approach is that the Tribunal \ncan now be seen \u2013 and exploited \u2013 as being imposed on Lebanon. A con-\nsensual approach, despite its legal shortcomings, would have been prefer-\nable, since the long-term acceptance by the affected society is of paramount \nimportance in the field of post-conflict justice. Ratification by the elected \nLebanese legislators would have gone a long way toward increasing its per-\nceived legitimacy. If Lebanon had voluntarily subscribed to the Tribunal, \nno intrusion into national sovereignty could have been claimed. Now \nobstacles with regard to domestic law were circumvented;67 but it remains \nto be seen whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage, and especially \nwhether the Lebanese population in its majority is still willing to accept \nthe Tribunal. \n IV. Institutional Characteristics \n Initially, according to Article 7(a) STL-Statute, three chambers will be cre-\nated.68 Th e trial chamber will consist of two international judges and one \n64)  Compare the Decision on Immunity from Jurisdiction of the Appeals Chamber of the SCSL \nof 31 May 2004 in the case of Charles Taylor, SCSL-2003-01-I, esp. para. 38. \n65)  See generally on this issue, B.

Hence, the international judges would form the major-\nity needed for a judgment. Th is is generally thought to ensure greater neu-\ntrality of a tribunal. Th e so-called \u201csuper-majority\u201d of the ECCC, where \nthe Cambodian national judges form the majority in a chamber but need \nthe support of at least one international judge,69 therefore continues to \nconstitute the exception. Th e presiding judge of the Appeals Chamber is \nalso going to be the President of the Tribunal as a whole. In addition, two \nalternate judges, one of them Lebanese, and as a third \u201cchamber\u201d a single \ninternational pre-trial judge will be designated from the beginning.70 \nHence any pre-trial issues, including the confirmation of indictments,71 \ncould be addressed quickly; by the same token, should any of the sitting \njudges be unable to continue his or her duties, a replacement would be \navailable immediately. All of this is designed to avoid unnecessary delays in \nthe proceedings. \n All of the judges, as well as the Prosecutor and the Registrar, will be \nappointed by the Secretary-General of the UN.72 With the exception of the \nLebanese Deputy Prosecutor,73 the government of Lebanon therefore only \nhas the right to propose candidates. In comparison, at the SCSL the gov-\nernment appoints the national judges; at the ECCC all judges are appointed \nby a Cambodian council, albeit in the case of international personnel only \nupon nomination by the Secretary-General.74 Second, at the Tribunal all \njudges and the Prosecutor are screened by a selection panel of two sitting \nor former international judges and a representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral before appointment.75 Th is is a new method of ensuring a high \n69)  Com.

Ultimately, the Tribunal itself will define its \nmandate under a potentially open-ended temporal jurisdiction. \n It has been suggested that the Tribunal would be the first international \ntribunal to tackle a political crime against a single person.87 While the IIIC \n82)  Rule 45 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the SCSL. \n83)  Art. 17 and 25 STL-Statute. \n84)  Comp.

Th e Security Council already added the \nshooting of Pierre Gemayel to the list of 14 possibly related incidents.88 It \nfurthermore included a double bus bombing in Ain Alaq near the town of \nBikfaya in February 2007 into the mandate of the IIIC.89 In June 2007, \nthe Member of Parliament Walid Eido and seven others were killed by a car \nbomb, further diminishing the slight majority of the government coali-\ntion. On 19 September 2007, another member of the majority in the Leb-\nanese Parliament, Antoine Ghanem, was killed by an apparent car bomb \nattack in Beirut, together with at least eight others.90 He was the tenth \nanti-Syria figure targeted since Hariri\u2019s assassination. A further attack took \nplace on 12 December 2007 when the Lebanese General Francois al-Hajj \nwas killed by yet another car bomb.91 At the end of 2007, the IIIC was \ninvestigating nine non-targeted bombings against the general public and \nten targeted attacks against individuals in addition to the Hariri-assassination. \nIn January 2008 the Security Council added the recent murder of the Leb-\nanese investigator Major Wissam Eid and fi ve others to that list. Hence, \nthe Tribunal could examine a total of 21 cases with approximately 60 vic-\ntims killed and approximately 500 wounded. Th is number could even \ngrow if further bombings aimed \u201conly\u201d at civilians were added, which have \ntaken place especially in the first half of 2007.

While the sheer number of affected victims is consider-\nably smaller in comparison to other situations which have given rise to \nprosecution by international tribunals, it is apparent that the attacks were \nstrategically planned to destabilize a whole country. In fact, among the \nvarious possible motives for each attack, the IIIC is looking closely at \nthe hypothesis that Rafik Hariri\u2019s likely success in the May 2005 elections \nwas the main reason behind his assassination.92 Th us, it is safe to say that \nattacks on the very state structure of Lebanon would be subject to scrutiny \nby the Tribunal. \n B. Th e Terrorist Attacks as de facto International Crimes \n Th e applicable subject-matter law will be Lebanese criminal law only, espe-\ncially with regard to crimes of terrorism;93 its domestic laws on rules and \nprocedures, as well as principles of international criminal procedure, shall \nguide the judges of the Tribunal when adopting their own.94 Hence, the \nSecurity Council and the Lebanese government both agreed that the attack \non Hariri constituted a local crime committed in violation of Lebanese \nlaw.95 Th is too is a deviation from past practices in various ways. First, the \ntraditional international criminal tribunals (the ICC, the ICTY and the \nICTR) only have jurisdiction over international crimes, such as genocide, \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. In contrast, hybrid tribunals usu-\nally provide for a mixture of international and national crimes as potential \n92)  See the 6th report of the IIIC (supra n. 10), para. 59; for possible motives concerning the \nother attacks, see paras. 64\u201367. \n93)  Art. 2 STL-Statute refers to \u201c(a) Th e provisions of the Lebanese Criminal Code relating to the \nprosecution and punishment of acts of terrorism, crimes and offences against life and personal \nintegrity, illicit associations and failure to report crimes and offences, including the rules regard-\ning the material elements of a crime, criminal participation and conspiracy; and (b) Articles 6 \nand 7 of the Lebanese law of 11 January 1958 on \u2018Increasing the penalties for sedition, civil war \nand interfaith struggle\u2019.\u201d \n94)  Art. 28 STL-Statute. \n95)  Comp. also I.

Th e critics of the Tribunal therefore argue that its crea-\ntion was unwarranted, as no international crime was in question.97 \n But two aspects speak against this assumption. First, the mere possibility \nof prosecuting crimes under national law before international tribunals is \nnothing new, as the jurisdictions of other hybrid tribunals indicate; sec-\nond, a qualification of the acts in question as international crimes seems \nactually plausible. During the negotiations on the STL-Statute, a qualifica-\ntion as crimes against humanity was rejected because there was no unanim-\nity among the members of the Security Council, despite suggestions of the \nSecretary-General to that effect.98 Th e latter had pointed out that the \nattacks in question could meet the definition of a crime against humanity, \nalthough there were differences in scope and number of the victims when \ncompared to other situations which are subject to the jurisdiction of inter-\nnational criminal jurisdiction.99 To start with, acts of terrorism can under \ncertain circumstances amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes.100 \nA qualification as a crime against humanity can for example be considered \n 96)  Comp. e.g. Art. 5 of the Statute of the SCSL; however, there this has remained a theoretical \npossibility only. \n 97)  See G. de Geouffre de La Pradelle \/ A.

Th e fact that acts of terrorism were not included in the \nRome Statute of the ICC does not mean that they are excluded from the \nlist of international crimes in general.106 Indeed, the absence of a clear \ndefinition of terrorism in international law could lead to the conclusion \nthat terrorism can still not be seen as a discrete international crime.107 But \nattacks such as in the instant case which are aimed at the destabilization of \na whole country, with wider repercussions for the surrounding region and \npossible support from other countries, can well be seen to be \u201cmost serious \ncrimes of concern to the international community as a whole\u201d.108 Th is was \nin fact acknowledged as such in an annex to the Rome Statute and recom-\nmended for discussion at the 2009 ICC review conference.109 Although \noverlap may occur, there may also be policy considerations to treat terror-\nism as a category distinct from crimes against humanity or war crimes, as \nthe ultimate aim of such an act most often is the coercion of a State or a \npopulation,110 and the killing of innocent persons is only a means to that \n105)  Also arguing that an inclusion of crimes against humanity would have been possible and \nindeed favourable, N.

Th e proposal to prosecute terrorist acts under the existing core crimes \nlargely stems from the absence of a special jurisdiction in this regard, \nnamely under the Rome Statute. Hence this necessity decreases once an \ninternational court specifically addresses the issue. Th is may be comparable \nto the discussion concerning universal jurisdiction by national courts for \ninternational crimes, which primarily originated from the absence of inter-\nnational enforcement mechanisms; now that more and more international \ncriminal courts and tribunals have been established, the call for regimes of \nuniversal jurisdiction may become less pressing.111 \n While it may be argued that crimes of international concern really call \nfor the application of international law, it was probably beyond the scope \nof the negotiations on this Tribunal to find a solution for the general prob-\nlem of defining terrorism conclusively. Actually, one possible result of the \npresent endeavour could precisely be a general definition of terrorism con-\nstrued and applied by an international court.112 While it may be acceptable \nthat the acts in question do not fall into the existing core crimes, including \ncrimes against humanity, it would be unwarranted to qualify them as \npurely national crimes. Th e Rome Statute is only exhaustive with regard to \nits own jurisdiction. And the existing international treaties condemning \nterrorism,113 as well as other sources of law,114 indicate that such a prosecu-\ndefines a terrorist act as \u201cany other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civil-\nian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed \nconflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or \nto compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing an act\u201d. \n111)  See R.

Cassese (supra n. 106), pp. 120\u2013130, who argues that a substantive definition of \n\u201cterrorism\u201d already exists on the international level, but that its enforcement by national or inter-\nnational courts is lacking; for a similar approach see Y.

However, the \ndecisive point is that in substance the acts to be prosecuted also have \nan international character.116 Th at substantive national and international \ncriminal laws are not mutually exclusive is already evidenced by the fact \nthat the Rome Statute of the ICC needs to be transformed into national \nlaw in order to make it applicable in national courts if a Member State \nwants to claim the privilege of primary jurisdiction under the complemen-\ntarity regime of Article 17 of the Rome Statute;117 from a formalistic point \nof view, this would make even the \u201ccore crimes\u201d crimes under national \nlaw.118 It is also safe to assume that the judges of the Tribunal, in applying \nthe Lebanese statutes, will look beyond Lebanese borders for additional \nguidance. \n In sum, the doubts as to the warrant to create an international tribunal, \nwhich are based on the asserted absence of an international crime, are \nunfounded. First, the circumstance that the Tribunal shall apply Lebanese \ncriminal law does not per se oppose to a qualification of the relevant acts \nas de facto international crimes. Second, it can be argued that the fact that \nLebanese law, unlike international law, provides for a definition of terror-\nism,119 made the inclusion of terrorism as an international crime in the \n115)  For an opposing view, see M.

Th e \nSecurity Council decided to establish a tribunal of international character, \nacting under Chapter VII. Since the requirements for the application of \nChapter VII are in place, it is within the Security Council\u2019s discretion to \ndecide what measures to take, as the list of possible measures mentioned in \nArticle 41 of the UN Charter is not exhaustive. Article 41 of the UN Char-\nter empowers the Security Council to take the measure it deems to be use-\nful.120 Th us, the discussion of whether the alleged crimes could be qualified \nas international crimes has no impact on the possibility to create a tribunal \nof an international character. \n C. Further Progressive Developments with Regard to International Criminal \nLaw \n One remarkable point is that the death penalty is excluded from possible \npenalties, although it is accepted in Lebanon.121 Th is is in line with the \nconsistent practices of international criminal tribunals supported by the \nUN.122 While the practices on the national level is still not uniform,123 as \nthe case of the Iraqi Special Tribunal demonstrates, it is noteworthy that \nRwanda in July 2007 approved the abolition of the death penalty in its \ndomestic law in order to allow for the referral of cases from the ICTR and \nother jurisdictions to its national courts.124 \n120)  See Tadic-Decision of the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY, Th e Prosecutor v.

Language as well as object and pur-\npose would support such a reading; the nature of a bilateral agreement \nwould have pointed against it. In effect, Resolution 1757 (2007) may be \nseen as further authority that amnesties for serious crimes are now prohib-\nited. Th is would be in line with the general trend in international law towards \na refusal of amnesties,127 as for example confirmed by the Trial Chamber of \nthe ICTY, when it held that an amnesty granted for torture would not spare \nperpetrators from being held criminally responsible.128 Th is trend is based on \na general sense of \u201cjustice\u201d that requires a person who committed a crime to \nbe punished, since prosecution does not only give significance to the victim\u2019s \nsuffering and serves as a partial remedy, but also prevents private revenge and \nhas a deterring effect.129 \n Lastly, the report of the Secretary-General stresses that at the Tribunal \nmany elements of civil law are to be found; among these are a more active \nrole of the judges and the possibility for trials in absentia of the accused.130 \n125)  Art. 6 STL-Statute. \n126)  Comp.

Trials in absentia are not \nuniformly accepted even in civil law countries and raise concerns with \nregard to the principle of a fair trial, as laid down e.g. in Article 14 \nICCPR.133 Th ose civil law countries which accept this sort of trial only do \nso in exceptional circumstances and in conjunction with specific safe-\nguards. In addressing these concerns, the mandatory appointment of \ndefence counsel either by the accused or through an assignment by the \nDefence Office and the possibility of a re-trial are foreseen in the Statute of \nthe Tribunal.134 Th e general rule was included due to fears that other States, \nespecially Syria, could refuse to hand over suspects. Still, trials in absentia \ncould again seriously jeopardize the legitimacy of the proceedings as per-\nceived by the general public and could be a detriment to the whole project \nof promoting justice in Lebanon.135 With good cause, the drafters of the \nRome Statute only allowed for trials without the presence of the accused if \nthat person continuously disrupts the proceedings.136 It can only be hoped \nthat the Prosecutor will exercise restraint in the use of this option, as oth-\nerwise the proceedings could face allegations of \u201cshow trials\u201d. \n131)  Art. 20(2) STL-Statute. \n132)  Comp.

Operational Aspects \n Th e official languages of the Tribunal will be Arabic, French and English.137 \nIt will have its seat outside Lebanon, with an investigative office in Bei-\nrut.138 Th is was decided partly due to the security situation. It will be the \nfirst time that the main seat of a hybrid tribunal is not established \u201cin \ntheatre\u201d, i.e. within the country where the crimes under investigation were \ncommitted. On the other hand, a \u201csplit\u201d prosecutorial seat is already uti-\nlized at the ICTR,139 and the SCSL has relocated one of its trials, namely \nthe one against Charles Taylor, from Sierra Leone to the seat of the ICC \nat Th e Hague.140 In order to facilitate access to the Tribunal for witnesses \nand the public, a location in the region was envisaged at first. One sugges-\ntion was Cyprus, to which the IIIC had already relocated during the armed \nconflict with Israel in the summer of 2006.141 However, in July 2007 the \nSecretary-General formally proposed Th e Hague, and the Dutch Govern-\nment positively responded one month later.142 While it is certainly clear \nthat the Dutch seat of government has much experience in hosting inter-\nnational tribunals, this will run contrary to one of the main structural \nprinciples of hybrid tribunals, namely to provide for as much local partici-\npation as possible in order to create a sense of \u201cownership\u201d by the affected \nsociety. \n Th e last point of contention during the negotiations in 2006 was the \nmechanism for financing the Tribunal. Th e report of the Secretary-General \nincluded various options on this issue, and the relevant part of the draft \nagreement had been left blank.143 Th e preferred option of the Secretary-\nGeneral involved some measure of assessed contributions from the UN \nbudget. However the Security Council decided in favour of voluntary \ncontributions from States, which are to provide 51% of the funding; \nthe remaining 49% of the budget shall be financed by the government of \n137)  Art. 14 STL-Statute foresees the possibility of limiting proceedings to one or two working \nlanguages. \n138)  Art. 8 STL-Agreement. \n139)  SG-Report (supra n. 29), para. 42. \n140)  See supra n. 60. \n141)  Another proposal was Italy. \n142)  See \u201cLebanon: Ban Ki-moon welcomes Dutch agreement to host Hariri tribunal\u201d, UN News \nCentre, 17 August 2007.

On the one hand, \nthe reluctance of the Security Council to fund another international tribu-\nnal, in the light of the immense costs incurred by the ICTY and ICTR over \nthe past years, may be a primary reason for the presently preferred option \nof establishing new ad hoc courts outside of the UN system.146 On the \nother hand, in case voluntary contributions fall short, the argument that \nthe budget should be supplemented by the UN now carries more weight \nsince it was the Security Council that created the Tribunal directly. \n Th e process of collecting enough initial funds as well as selecting the \njudges and other personnel will take at least a year. Th erefore the Tribunal \nwill not become operative before mid-2008 at the earliest. But the transi-\ntion from the already existing IIIC to the OTP of the Tribunal should \nmake this process speedier than elsewhere. Th e Commissioner of the \nIIIC Bellemare (Canada) is also the Presecutor-Designate of the STL. By \nMarch 2008, Robin Vincent (United Kingdom), the former Registrar at \nthe SCSL, had been appointed as the Registrar of the STL, the manage-\nment committee had been established, premises in Th e Hague had been \nidentifi ed, and more than US$ 60 million had been received in contribu-\ntions and pledges. Th e Tribunal is to have an initial mandate for three years \nof operation, with a view to a possible prolongation.147 Th e SCSL had at \nfirst also been intended to operate for a period of three years only, but will \nnow most likely take at least eight years to conclude its work. Th e experi-\nences of the latter shows that even with the greatest efforts of the staff and \nimmense financial pressure by donors, a tribunal\u2019s operation usually lasts \nlonger than originally planned. At the Lebanon-Tribunal, the conduct of \noperations will be assisted by a management committee.148 A body of this \n144)  Letter of 21 November 2006 (supra n. 17). \n145)  See \u201cBan Ki-moon condemns latest murder of Lebanese Lawmaker\u201d (supra n. 90). \n146)  Comp.

Th e Perspectives of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon \n Politically, Lebanon seems to be a divided country. At present, backers of \nthe western leaning government of Prime Minister Siniora on the one side \nand of President Lahoud and the Hezbollah-led opposition on the other, \nallegedly supported by Syria and Iran, are locked in a stand-off. Th e crea-\ntion of the Tribunal has been one of the fundamental points of contention \nwithin Lebanese public debate since late 2006.150 Both proponents and \nopponents to the Tribunal regard it as a major factor in enabling \u2013 or in \ncontrast endangering \u2013 the continuation of the peace process and the even-\ntual completion of Lebanese national sovereignty. Th e proposed Tribunal \nwas strongly criticised as enforcing political divisions among the Lebanese \npopulation and as an \u201cinstrumentalization of international justice\u201d.151 Some \neven see the Tribunal as the focal point of a Franco-American conspiracy \nagainst Syria and as an attempt to ensure the continuing influence of West-\nern States in Lebanon. More moderate critics point to inconsistencies con-\ncerning the lack of international judicial mechanisms for investigating \npotential war crimes during the war with Israel in 2006, or even during the \nLebanese civil war in 1975 to 1989.152 But the fact that the latter two pro-\nposals seem entirely unrealistic at present should not detract from the \nassessment that a tribunal aimed at the most recent problems could at least \nbe one step towards reconciliation. For the first time, the circle of violence \nmay be broken by a neutral allocation of accountability. \n Th e future will show whether the fears that this international tribunal \nwould spark new violence or even lead to a new civil war were legitimate. \n149)  Comp.

As of early 2008 no successor had been selected. \nTh e street fighting since December 2006, which left about a dozen dead; \nthe renewed bombings; the fightings between a militant Palestinian group \nand the Lebanese military in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp153 with a \ntotal of approximately 380 casualties, from May 2007 to early September; \nand the killing of six UNIFIL-peacekeepers by a car bomb in June 2007 \nmay have been signs of worse to come. Th e IIIC has called the security \noutlook \u201cbleak\u201d.154 But most of these attacks seem to have been isolated \nevents, staged by relatively small groups of persons, without a large backing \nin the Lebanese population. Th e next important step will be the election \nby the Lebanese Parliament of a successor to President Lahoud, whose \nterm expired on 23 November 2007.155 \n From the viewpoint of international law, however, most of the objec-\ntions specifically aimed at the Tribunal seem to be unfounded. Admittedly, \nthere are aspects which may dampen its legitimacy, such as the fact that the \nTribunal was eventually established by a resolution of the Security Council \nand not by the proposed agreement with a sovereign state; that its location \nmay be far away from the country; that the Tribunal will apply national \ncriminal law; and that trials in absentia are possible. But these challenges \nmay be overcome if all persons involved show restraint in order to avoid an \nalienation between the Tribunal and further parts of the Lebanese popula-\ntion. More importantly, these aspects should not keep the general public \nfrom accepting the Tribunal as an instrument to assist their struggle of \ncoming to terms with their past, even if its creation was sub-optimal. \nLegally, the Tribunal represents a real advancement in the further develop-\nment of effective but fair instruments for international adjudication and \ndemonstrates many lessons learned from other existing international crim-\ninal tribunals; among these are the provisions for efficient trial manage-\nment; the simple majority of international judges; the statutory defence \nWetzel and Mitri \/ \n Th e Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 7 (2008) 81\u2013114 113\n156)  For a similarly positive critique of the procedural innovations in the Statute, see G.

More generally, neutral third parties \ncan assist in addressing deep-rooted conflicts which the State itself is \nunable to solve. Th ere is reason to believe that the Special Tribunal for \nLebanon, consisting of a diverse group of judges and other personnel, \noperating according to a clear set of rules, and observed by the world legal \nand political community, can also serve this function. Overall, more argu-\nments point towards the conclusion that the Tribunal deserves a chance to \nprove itself. \n From the vantage point of the development of international criminal \nlaw in general, the establishment of the Tribunal is another step in the on-\ngoing effort to push back impunity and to use formalized international \njustice as a means to promote regional stability and peace. It could even be \nseen as a necessary precondition to that cause.157 Although the Tribunal \nbelongs to the so-called third generation of hybrid international tribunals, \nit adds some new components to this already diverse group. Moreover, as \nthe short period of time needed for the negotiations indicates, the interna-\ntional criminal tribunals of the recent past now provide so much institu-\ntional experience that one can almost speak of the possibility of courts \u201coff \nthe shelf \u201d. Lastly, the Tribunal highlights that even after the coming into \nforce of the Rome Statute, a need for new international tribunals may \narise, especially in cases where the ICC has no jurisdiction.158 Some have \npredicted that ad hoc-tribunals will become irrelevant once the ICC is \noperative, or at least will only have importance for conflicts of the past.159 \nHowever, the proposed Tribunal could be an indication that any interna-\ntional system of justice which lies ahead still has space for a diversified \nWetzel and Mitri \/ \n114 Th e Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 7 (2008) 81\u2013114\n160)  Comp.
