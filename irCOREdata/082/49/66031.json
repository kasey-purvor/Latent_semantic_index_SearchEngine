The \nmaintenance of most mammalian cell lines in culture requires the addition of serum to the culture medium. \nThe elimination of serum from mammalian cell culture is desirable since serum is expensive and a source \nof contaminants, e.g. viruses, mycoplasma or prions. Here we describe the composition of serum- and \nprotein-free media for the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line DUKXB11. The serum-free formulation \nsupports excellent growth of CHO DUKXB11 cells at low (23 cells\/cm2) and high (2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2) seeding \ndensities characterized by a generation time of 10 - 12 h, and, after addition of 0.2% pluronic F-68, the \ngrowth of a recombinant suspension cell line derived from DUKXB11. In addition, this formulation also \nallowed us to adapt recombinant cell lines expressing various amounts of human antithrombin ATIII (ATIII) \nto serum-free conditions. Secretion of ATIII was readily observed in the serum-free medium. Minor \nchanges to the serum-free formulation resulted in a protein free formulation that supported growth of CHO \nDUKXB11 cells, growth of recombinant CHO cells expressing ATIII, and production of ATIII. \nKey words \nChinese hamster ovary cells, serum-free medium, protein-free medium, recombinant protein production, \nantithrombin III \nAbbreviations \nATIII - antithrombin III, CHO - Chinese hamster ovary, DHFR - dihydrofolate reductase, ELISA - enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay, FCS - fetal calf serum, L-LDH - L-lactate dehydrogenase, MTX - \nmethotrexate \nIntroduction \nGenetically engineered CHO cells are an important source for a large variety of proteins of great \ntherapeutic value (Kane, 1991; Kaufman, 1993; Kellems, 1991). A common method to construct \nrecombinant CHO cell lines is to transfect dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) negative (dhfr-) CHO cell lines \nwith the cDNA genes for DHFR and the protein of interest. Initial transformants are selected for growth in \nthe absence of glycine, purines, and thymidine. The transfected genes are then amplified by stepwise \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     3 \nincreasing the concentration of methotrexate (MTX), a competitive inhibitor of DHFR, in the culture \nmedium (Kaufman, 1990). During this process the transfected genes are amplified several 1000-fold \nresulting in an increased production rate for the recombinant protein (Crouse et al., 1983). These genetic \nmanipulations are usually done in the presence of animal serum. The use of serum is required to grow \nmany mammalian cell lines in vitro (Maurer, 1986; Sato, 1975). However, the elimination of serum from \nthe culture process is desirable, since it is expensive, a source of contaminants (Kimberlin, 1991, Minor, \n1994), and weaning of recombinant cells from serum is time consuming and unreliable. \nTwo dhfr- CHO cell lines are in use today. In DG44 cells both DHFR loci are deleted (Urlaub et al., \n1983). A serum-free formulation for this cell line was described (Kim et al., 1999). DUKXB11, also referred \nto as DXB11, DUKX, DUKXB1, or DUK-XB11 (Gandor et al., 1995), was derived from CHO K1 cells \n(Urlaub and Chasin, 1980). Clonal growth of CHO K1 cells was reported in the serum-free media F12 \n(Ham, 1965), MCDB 301, and MCDB 302 (Hamilton and Ham, 1977). However, these media did not \nsupport the growth of high-density cultures, and are therefore of limited use for high-level production of \nrecombinant proteins. Serum-independent suspension cell lines, e.g. CHO SSF3, were selected from \nDUKXB11 cells by replacing part of the medium every week (Gandor et al., 1995). A protein-free medium \nfor CHO SSF3 cells was described (Zang et al., 1995). In addition, a cell line preadapted to serum-free \nconditions, derived from DUKXB11 cells was described (Sinacore et al., 1996). However, the serum-free \nmedium formulation used in this study was not published. In addition, many formulations for recombinant \nCHO cells expressing a variety of proteins are described (Asakura et al., 1992; Bl\u00fcml et al., 1994; Hata et \nal., 1992; Ii et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1998; Kitano, 1994; Lee et al., 1999; Matthews et al., 1994; Mizuguchi \net al., 1993; Scharfenberg and Wagner, 1995; Schorn et al., 1994; Wyatt, 1994). However, a versatile \nserum-free medium formulation for the parental cell line DUKXB11 has not been reported to date. \nHere we present a serum-free medium for CHO DUKXB11 cells that equally well supports growth \nat low (23 cells\/cm2) and high (2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2) seeding densities. We evaluated the growth properties, \nproduction of a model recombinant protein by recombinant CHO cells derived from DUKXB11, and the \nease with which minor modifications of this formulation support growth in suspension or protein-free \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     4 \nconditions. We discuss the influence of cholesterol containing growth supplements on growth under \nserum-free conditions. \nMaterials and Methods \nMaterials \nThe dhfr- CHO cell line DUKXB11 was described by Urlaub and Chasin (1980). The ATIII secreting cell \nlines CHO-A11-A2, CHO-A11-A27, CHO-A11-A279, and CHO-A11-A279-C7 were derived from CHO \nDUKXB11 cells and secrete increasing amounts of ATIII (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a; Zettlmeissl et al., \n1987). The cell line CHO-SS3-A2 (Tebbe et al., 1995) was a kind gift of Prof. J. Lehmann (University of \nBielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany). The suppliers of most materials were listed previously (Schr\u00f6der and \nFriedl, 1997a). Pluronic F-68 was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and casein peptone \nsoybean flour peptone broth from Unipath (Wesel, Germany). A 6 x stock solution of the casein peptone \nsoybean flour peptone broth was filter sterilized and than added to the final medium. Human fibronectin \nwas isolated from human blood plasma (German Red Cross, Frankfurt\/Main, Germany) as described \nbefore (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a). Animal-source derived components used in the serum-free \nformulation were fetuin from fetal calf serum (no. 104874, ICN Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany), insulin \nfrom bovine pancreas (no. I-5500, Sigma), human holo-transferrin (no. OTRE 04105, Behringwerke AG, \nMarburg, Germany), and casein peptone soybean flour peptone. CHO-T1-SF medium lacking all proteins, \ncasein peptone soybean flour peptone, pluronic F-68, hypoxanthine, thymidine, and methotrexate was \npurchased from Life Technologies (Eggenstein, Germany) as a custom made formulation. Several amino \nacids can be derived from animal sources, e.g. L-cysteine and L-cystine. Therefore, special care has to be \ntaken that the medium manufacturer utilizes alternative, non-animal derived, sources for these amino \nacids (Jayme and Smith, 1997). HyQ-CCM5 medium (about 200 mg\/l protein) was obtained from Greiner \n(Frickenhausen, Germany). \nCell Culture \nThe anchorage-dependent cell lines CHO DUKXB11, CHO-A11-A2, CHO-A11-A27, CHO-A11-A279, and \nCHO-A11-A279-C7 were cultivated as described previously (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a). The \nsuspension cell line CHO-SS3-A2 was cultivated in 250 ml spinner flasks at 37\u00b0C, 10% CO2 and stirring at \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     5 \n30 rpm. Spinner flasks were inoculated with at least 1\u00b7105 cells\/ml. The composition of the serum-free \nmedium CHO-T1-SF is described in detail in the \"Results and Discussion\" section. Colony forming \nefficiencies at seeding densities of 23 or 230 cells\/cm2 were determined as described before (Schr\u00f6der \nand Friedl, 1997b). Conditioned media for clonal growth assays were collected 3 h after seeding cells at \n2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2 into 75 cm2 T-flasks as described by Schr\u00f6der and Friedl (1997a). \nAdaptation of cell lines to serum-free conditions \nAll cell lines were weaned off 10% (v\/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) by stepwise decreasing the serum \nconcentration by 50% in every other passage. At the beginning of the weaning process the basal medium \nwas Ham's F12 (Ham, 1965) for CHO DUKXB11 cells and DMEM (Dulbecco and Freeman, 1959; Smith \net al., 1960) supplemented with 40 mg\/l L-proline (Kao and Puck, 1967, 1968) for the recombinant cell \nlines. Below a serum concentration of 1.25% (v\/v) the basal medium was switched to IF-medium (Friedl et \nal., 1989), and below 0.4% (v\/v) the culture vessels were coated with 5 \u00b5g\/cm2 fibronectin. At a serum \nconcentration of 0.1% (v\/v) the basal medium was switched to CHO-T1-SF, which enabled us to \ncompletely eliminate serum from the medium. 0.1% (v\/v) ExCyte III was included in early formulations of \nthe serum-free medium. In later formulations it was omitted from the medium, since no growth promoting \neffects were observed (see \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d). The suspension cell line CHO-SS3-A2 was \npreviously grown in a serum-free medium (B\u00fcntemeyer et al., 1991) and grew readily in medium \nCHO-T1-SF. \nAdaptation of cell lines to a protein-free medium \nTo adapt dhfr- CHO cells to a protein-free medium the following modifications to medium CHO-T1-SF \nwere introduced: fetuin and coating of the culture vessels with fibronectin were omitted without observing \nany detrimental effects. holo-transferrin was replaced with 7.5 \u00b5M tropolone (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) \nas an iron chelator and 2.5 \u00b5M Fe(III) in the chemical form of ferric ammonium citrate (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, \nGermany; Metcalfe et al., 1994). Cells grown under these conditions were stepwise weaned off insulin. \nThe insulin concentration was decreased to 10 ng\/ml without adverse effects on cell growth. Then, the \ninsulin concentration was decreased in tenfold steps to 100 pg\/ml, and then omitted from the culture. We \ndesignate the protein-free formulation as medium CHO-T1-PF. \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     6 \nAnalytical Procedures \nThe following methods were described previously: Collection and storage of conditioned media, the \npreparation of cell extracts (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a), cell counting (Warburton and James, 1993), the \ndetermination of ATIII (Schr\u00f6der et al., 1996), and L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) (Vassault, 1987). \nThe fraction of cells lysed during culture was calculated as described previously (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, \n1997a). \nResults and discussion \nAdaptation of CHO DUKXB11 and recombinant cell lines to serum-free conditions \nThe gradual reduction of the serum concentration increases the chances for successful adaptation of cells \nto a serum-free environment (Kim et al., 1999). For this reason we decided to stepwise decrease the \nserum concentration in every other passage by 50% to wean cells off serum. In this way the serum \nconcentration could be easily reduced from 10% (v\/v) to 1.25% (v\/v). To further decrease the serum \nconcentration it was necessary to switch to a basal medium formulation richer in nutrients. For CHO \nDUKXB11 cells the basal medium was originally Ham's F12, and for the recombinant cell lines DMEM \nsupplemented with 40 mg\/l L-proline. Changing the basal medium for all cell lines to IF-medium, a 1:1 \nmixture of Ham's F12 medium and IMDM (Friedl et al., 1989), allowed us to decrease the serum \nconcentration to 0.4% (v\/v). To decrease the serum concentration below 0.4% (v\/v) a switch to our serum-\nfree medium formulation CHO-T1-SF, which is even richer in nutrients than IF-medium, was necessary. In \naddition, the culture dishes were coated with 5 \u00b5g\/cm2 affinity-purified fibronectin. Initially, HEPES was \nused as buffer. Cells grown in this formulation usually reached maximum densities around 8\u00b7104 cells\/cm2. \nReplacing HEPES with a sodium carbonate buffer resulted in much higher cell densities in stationary \nphase, usually around 4\u00b7105 cells\/cm2. In sodium carbonate buffered CHO-T1-SF medium serum was \nreduced to 0.1% (v\/v), and then completely eliminated from the culture. \nThe final composition of the serum-free medium CHO-T1-SF is listed in Table 1. Compared to \nother basal media (Morton, 1970; Rutzky and Pumper, 1974) the medium is very rich in metabolites, e.g. \nD-glucose, L-glutamine, and other L-amino acids. The protein content totals to 20 mg\/l, which is \nsignificantly lower than that of other serum-free media, e.g. EX-CELL 301 (100 mg\/l; Wyatt, 1994) or \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     7 \nUC203 (1 g\/l; Ii et al., 1995). Only one component, casein peptone soybean flour peptone broth, is \nundefined, but aproteinous and an additional source of amino acids. Of animal origin were fetuin, insulin, \nholo-transferrin, and casein peptone soybean flour peptone (for details see Materials and Methods). \nHowever, bovine insulin can easily be replaced by recombinant human insulin (Keen and Rapson, 1995). \nThe sodium bicarbonate content of the medium requires buffering with 10% CO2 in air (Esser, 1988). \nInfluence of ExCyte III on clonal growth \nAddition of cholesterol sources to serum-free media enhances growth of several cell lines (Hink, 1991). \nExCyte III is an optimal source for cholesterol and other lipids in a lipoprotein-bound manner (B\u00fcntemeyer \net al., 1994). Therefore, we initially included 0.1% (w\/v) ExCyte III in our serum-free medium. However, no \ngrowth was observed in this formulation when cells were seeded at very low cell densities (230 cells\/cm2). \nIn the course of determining the cause for this observation, we noted an inhibitory effect of ExCyte III on \ngrowth at low densities. To examine the influence of ExCyte III on growth of our CHO cell lines at low \ndensities in more detail, we determined the colony forming efficiencies in the presence and absence of \n0.1% (w\/v) ExCyte III at two different seeding densities. No cell line formed colonies when seeded at \n23 cells\/cm2 or 230 cells\/cm2 in medium CHO-T1-SF + 0.1% (v\/v) ExCyte III (data not shown). However, \nall cell lines formed colonies when plated at similar cell densities into CHO-T1-SF + 0.1% (v\/v) ExCyte III \nconditioned for 3 h by the various cell lines as described in \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d (Table 2). CHO-T1-\nSF medium lacking ExCyte III also supported growth at these low seeding densities (Table 2). We \nconclude that ExCyte III inhibits growth of CHO DUKXB11 cells and recombinant CHO cells derived from \nCHO DUKXB11 cells at low densities. However, no inhibitory influence on cell growth at higher cell \ninocula, e. g. 2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2 (Fig. 1) was observed. A long-term requirement for ExCyte III, e.g. for a \nperiod of 20 or more passages, was not observed for any one of the cell lines used in this study (data not \nshown). In addition, the toxic effect of ExCyte III was abolished when conditioned medium was used. \nThese observations indicate that the action of cellular metabolism on components in ExCyte III protects \nthe cells from the toxic effects of ExCyte III on clonal growth of CHO cells. Another possibility is that \ncompounds released from the cells during the conditioning process counter and outweigh the toxic effects \nof ExCyte III on cell growth. In accordance with our results, B\u00fcntemeyer et al. (1994) reported an \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     8 \ninhibitory effect of ExCyte III on growth of hybridoma cells. In contrast, cholesterol was required for long-\nterm multiplication of SF-9 cells under serum-free conditions (Hink, 1991). The differences between the \nvarious cell lines may be due to different cholesterol requirements, endogenous synthesis rates, and \ncholesterol uptake rates (Chen and Kandutsch, 1983; Hewlett, 1991; Schmid, 1991). \nColony forming efficiencies in medium CHO-T1-SF \nThe colony forming efficiency in medium CHO-T1-SF after seeding at 23 cells\/cm2 was between 40-75% \nfor most cell lines (Table 2). These values show no statistically significant differences to the colony \nforming efficiency seen in the presence of 10% (v\/v) FCS (Gasser et al., 1985). When conditioned CHO-\nT1-SF medium plus 0.1% (w\/v) ExCyte III was used, slightly lower colony forming efficiencies were \nobserved than with fresh CHO-T1-SF medium (Table 2). Thus, the toxic effects of ExCyte III on growth at \nlow densities are not completely reversed by the use of conditioned medium. Alternatively, metabolic \nwaste products may have already accumulated to levels in conditioned medium at which they exert an \ninhibitory effect on growth at low densities and therefore counteract the protective function of conditioning \nagainst ExCyte III. However, the colony forming efficieny in CHO-T1-SF medium was lower than in the \ncommercial serum-free medium formulation HyQ-CCM5 for cell lines CHO DUKXB1, CHO-A11-A2, CHO-\nA11-A27, and CHO-A11-A279 (Table 2). The higher protein content of HyQ-CCM5 medium, 200 mg\/l \nversus 20 mg\/l for CHO-T1-SF medium, may make this medium especially suited for growth and survival \nof cells at low seeding densities. In addition, the colony forming efficiency for cell line CHO-A11-A2 was \nsignificantly lower than for the other cell lines in medium CHO-T1-SF (Table 2). This may be due to \nadditional nutritional requirements of this particular cell line, or incomplete adaptation of these cells to \nCHO-T1-SF medium. \n \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     9 \n \nPhenotype of CHO DUKXB11 cells adapted to serum-free conditions \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     10 \nOne important feature of CHO DUKXB11 cells is that they lack DHFR. However, in CHO DUKXB11 cells \nonly one allele carries a deletion, whereas the other carries a point mutation (Gandor et al., 1995). This \nallele can revert, and result in overgrowth of the culture by dhfr+ cells during adaptation to serum-free \nconditions (Gandor et al., 1995; Sinacore et al., 1996). For this reason we tested if reversion to dhfr+ and \novergrowth of dhfr- cells by dhfr+ cells occurred during the adaptation process to serum-free conditions. \nCHO DUKXB11 cells adapted to serum-free conditions were seeded at 2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2 into a 25 cm2 \nT-flask containing CHO-T1-SF medium lacking hypoxanthine and thymidine. Under these conditions only \ndhfr+ cells grow, since hypoxanthine and thymidine are essential nutrients for dhfr- cells (Kaufman, 1990). \nAfter growth for ten days at 37\u00b0C, 10% CO2, and medium replacement every other day no viable cells \nwere visible in the flask and no colonies had formed (Fig. 2). As our CHO-T1-SF medium supports growth \nof CHO DUKXB11 cells at seeding densities as low as 23 cells\/cm2, we conclude that overgrowth of the \ninitial culture by dhfr+ cells did not happen. \nGrowth characteristics in serum-free medium CHO-T1-SF \nNext we were interested in how well our new serum-free medium formulation supports growth of CHO cell \nlines at higher cell densities. First, we decided to determine generation times for CHO cell lines in the \nserum-free medium. To exclude inhibitory effects of substrate limitation on cell growth the generation time \nin the exponential growth phase was determined. Therefore, growth curves for all cell lines were recorded \nafter seeding each cell line with a density of 2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2 into ten 8.7 cm2 dishes. Every 12 h one dish \nwas sacrificed for collection of conditioned media and cell counting. The culture medium in the remaining \ndishes was replaced every 24 h. The generation time in the exponential growth phase (Table 3) was \ncalculated by linear regression from the slope of the first four to six data points of the growth curve (Fig. \n1). Most anchorage-dependent cell lines had generation times of \u224812 h in the exponential growth phase. \nThis is the optimum for rodent cells in vitro (Parchment and Natarajan, 1992). For other serum-free media \ngeneration times of \u224824 h were reported (Gasser et al., 1985; Lee et al., 1996; Renner et al., 1995; Sharif \nand Stevenson, 1993; Sinacore et al., 1996). Only for medium UC203 generation times similar to those \nobserved in medium CHO-T1-SF were reported (Ii et al., 1995). Furthermore, CHO DUKXB11 cells and \nthe recombinant cell lines CHO-A11-A2, CHO-A11-A27, and CHO-A11-A279 reached densities around \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     11 \n4\u00b7105 cells\/cm2. Thus, CHO-T1-SF medium supports growth of these cell lines to high densities. We \nobserved no limitation for the number of doublings (\u2265 about 100 doublings) that all cell lines could be \nmaintained in CHO-T1-SF medium. This suggests that dilution of essential nutrients below critical \nconcentrations through several passages did not occur in our medium formulation. \n \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     12 \n \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     13 \nThe recombinant cell line CHO-A11-A279-C7 displayed an elevated generation time and reached \nmaximum densities of 1-2\u00b7105 cells\/cm2, which was consistently less than for the other cell lines used in \nthis study. ATIII accumulates in an immature and aggregated state in the endoplasmic reticulum of these \ncells (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a, 2002), which most likely activates an intracellular stress response to \nthe aggregated protein, resulting in inhibition of translation, inhibition of cell cycle progression and \napoptosis (Liu and Kaufman, 2003). Utilization of D-glucose and production of L-lactate by all four \nrecombinant cell lines was very similar (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a), and only CHO-A11-A279-C7 cells \nshowed an increase in utilization of L-glutamine and production of ammonia. This increase in ammonia \nproduction was offset by the lower cell density at which CHO-A11-A279-C7 cells enter stationary phase, \nresulting in similar ammonia concentrations for all cell lines (data not shown). \nTo determine the generation time of suspension cells spinner flasks were inoculated with \n1\u00b7105 cells\/ml of the suspension cell line CHO-SS3-A2 and incubated with stirring at 30 rpm. At the times \nindicated in Fig. 1 samples for cell counting were withdrawn. We observed a generation time of \u224825 h in \nCHO-T1-SF medium, a value that is comparable to other results published for CHO cells grown in \nsuspension (Gasser et al., 1985; Lee et al., 1996; Renner et al., 1995; Sharif and Stevenson, 1993; \nSinacore et al., 1996). \nExponential growth of all cell lines commenced directly after seeding with no lag-phase (Fig. 1). \nThe presence of a lag-phase can indicate the requirement of medium conditioning for cell growth. The \nabsence of a lag-phase is consistent with growth at low densities of all cell lines in medium CHO-T1-SF \nand demonstrates the high degree of adaptation of these cell lines to our medium formulation. In contrast, \nin medium UC203, in which CHO cells also had a generation time of \u224812 h, a lag-phase of about 48 h was \nobserved (Ii et al., 1995). \nCell lysis under serum-free conditions \nTeige et al. (1994) reported that cell lysis can be a major problem when ATIII is produced in serum-free \nmedia. This prompted us to investigate the degree of cell lysis in medium CHO-T1-SF after inoculation at \nhigher cell densities (2\u00b7104 cells\/cm2). The extent of cell lysis during the cultivation of mammalian cells can \nbe determined by measuring the activity of L-LDH in conditioned media (Bour et al., 1988; Goergen et al., \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     14 \n1993; Jauregul et al., 1981; Legrand et al., 1992; Racher et al., 1990). However, we were not able to \ndetect any L-LDH activity in media conditioned by high-density cultures of any one of the anchorage-\ndependent cell lines used in this study. In contrast, L-LDH activity was readily detected in cell extracts of \nall cell lines. The intracellular L-LDH content of 1\u00b7106 cells was 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 units for CHO DUKXB11 cells, \n0.92 \u00b1 0.02 units for CHO-A11-A2 cells, 1.02 \u00b1 0.05 units for CHO-A11-A27 cells, 1.05 units for \nCHO-A11-A279 cells, and 0.34 \u00b1 0.02 units for CHO-A11-A279-C7 cells. The relative amounts of \nintracellular L-LDH corresponded to previously published data (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a). The \ndetection limit of our L-LDH assay is \u22480.0025 units\/ml in conditioned medium, and from this we estimate \nthat during a 24 h conditioning phase less than 1% of the cells, if any, lysed. These results are in sharp \ncontrast to those reported by Teige et al. (1994). Teige et al. (1994) used CHO cells that were not weaned \noff serum for their serum-free culture, whereas in our study a careful adaptation of our CHO cell lines to \nserum-free conditions and a medium optimization took place. These different approaches to the serum-\nfree cultivation process can explain the dramatic differences in the sensitivity of CHO cells to serum-free \nconditions observed in both studies. \nProduction of ATIII under serum-free conditions \nNext, we were interested in how well medium CHO-T1-SF supports the production of a recombinant \nprotein. Conditioned media collected during the recording of the growth curves were assayed for ATIII by \nan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Schr\u00f6der et al., 1996) and the cumulated ATIII \nconcentration plotted against the cultivation time (Fig. 1). ATIII accumulated to \u224830 mg\/l in anchorage-\ndependent cultures of CHO-A11-A279-C7 cells (Fig. 1A) and to \u224815 mg\/l in suspension cultures of CHO-\nSS3-A2 cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, medium CHO-T1-SF is suitable for the production of recombinant proteins \neither with anchorage-dependent or suspension cells. ATIII secreted from all recombinant cell lines was \nbiologically active as judged from its specific progressive activity and specific heparin cofactor activity \n(Schr\u00f6der et al., 1997a). A significant effect of ExCyte III on ATIII-secretion or activity was not observed \n(data not shown). To compare the suitability of CHO-T1-SF medium for production of ATIII we determined \nspecific ATIII secretion rates for various anchorage-dependent recombinant cell lines producing human \nATIII in medium CHO-T1-SF and medium CHO-T1-SF supplemented with 10% (v\/v) or 1% (v\/v) FCS. \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     15 \nSpecific ATIII secretion rates were 2.5 to 3.8-fold higher in the presence of FCS (Table 4) when compared \nto previously published values for the serum-free medium (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a) and correspond to \nspecific ATIII secretion rates published previously for these cell lines (Zettlmeissl et al., 1987). \nFurthermore, specific ATIII secretion rates and accumulation of ATIII under serum-free conditions were \ncomparable to previously published data for other recombinant proteins produced in CHO cells under \nserum-free conditions, e.g. human macrophage colony stimulating factor (Sinacore et al., 1996), human \nclotting factor IX (Sinacore et al., 1996), \u03b3-interferon (Gu et al., 1997; Xie et al., 1997), and the humanized \nantibody CAMPATH-1H (Keen and Rapson, 1995). However, the increase in productivity under serum-\nsupplemented conditions was offset by lower cell densities of confluent cultures in the presence of FCS \n(usually around 4\u00b7104 cells\/cm2). In addition, in practice more demanding and cost-intensive purification \nstrategies for ATIII from serum-supplemented cultures would be necessary to isolate ATIII from serum-\nsupplemented cultures. This is, for example, illustrated by the observation that ATIII secreted from CHO-\nA11-A2 cells in the presence of 10% (v\/v) FCS did not accumulate over background levels over 24 h \n(Table 4). In summary, we conclude that production of ATIII in the serum-free medium CHO-T1-SF is \nsuperior to production of ATIII in serum-supplemented cultures. \nProtein-free medium formulation \nFinally, we wanted to know how easily a protein-free medium formulation can be developed on the basis \nof the serum-free formulation. First, we tried to omit the protein components from the medium formulation. \nOmission of fetuin and coating of the tissue culture dishes with 5 \u00b5g\/cm2 fibronectin did not interfere with \ngrowth of any cell line. However, the cells were sensitive to removal of holo-transferrin and insulin. Iron \nsaturated heavy ion chelators, such as tropolone, are an excellent replacement for holo-transferrin \n(Metcalfe et al., 1994). Addition of 2.5 \u00b5M Fe(III) in the form of ferric ammonium citrate, and 7.5 \u00b5M \ntropolone to our medium formulation supported long-term growth of CHO cell lines in the absence of holo-\ntransferrin (data not shown). To eliminate insulin from the culture process we decided to wean the cells off \ninsulin in a similar way as performed for weaning the cells off serum. The insulin concentration was \ndecreased from 10 \u00b5g\/ml to 10 ng\/ml, then to 1 ng\/ml, and to 0.1 ng\/ml, and finally omitted from the \nculture process. Cell lines CHO DUKXB11, CHO-A11-A2, CHO-A11-A27, and CHO-A11-A279 were \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     16 \nsuccessfully adapted to a protein-free medium formulation and could be maintained in the protein-free \nmedium for at least 50 doublings. However, we were not able to adapt cell line CHO-A11-A279-C7 to \ninsulin-free conditions, which may be due to an intrinsic stressed state of this cell line (see above for \ndiscussion). Further engineering of mammalian cell lines, especially by increasing the capacity of the \nsecretory pathway for the production of recombinant secretory proteins, and uncoupling of cell cycle \ncontrol from control by stress responses initiated in the secretory pathway (Calfon et al., 2002; Reimold et \nal., 2001; Schr\u00f6der et al., 2000), may be necessary to develop protein-free culture conditions for highly \noverexpressing cell lines. In summary, cells grown in our serum-free medium formulation can rapidly and \neasily be adapted to a completely protein-free medium formulation. \nGrowth characteristics and ATIII secretion in protein-free medium \nTo determine how well the various cell lines were adapted to the protein-free medium we measured \ngrowth characteristics and ATIII secretion. Experiments similar to those described above for the serum-\nfree medium formulation revealed that generation times are significantly increased in the protein-free \nformulation for cell lines CHO DUKXB11, CHO-A11-A2, and CHO-A11-A279 when compared to the \nserum-free formulation (Table 5). However, they are comparable with generation times reported for CHO \nSSF3 cells producing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (about 27 h, Zang et al., 1995) or a \nhumanized immunoglobin G kappa light chain (about 15 h, Zang et al., 1995). The increased generation \ntimes in the protein-free medium are probably due to a lack of insulin and indicate a partial block in \nprogression through the cell cycle, presumably a prolongation of the G1-phase. However, all cell lines \ninitiated growth after seeding with no obvious lag-phase (Fig. 3A), indicating that conditioning of the \nmedium was not required for growth. In addition, the protein-free medium routinely supported growth of \ncultures to densities of 1\u00b7105 to 2\u00b7105 cells\/cm2 in stationary phase (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Last, the \nprotein-free medium had no adverse effects on ATIII-secretion. Accumulation of ATIII in protein-free \nmedium conditioned by stationary cultures (Fig. 3B)  was indistinguishable from serum-free conditions \n(Fig. 3 in Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a). Further, specific ATIII secretion rates for CHO-A11-A2, CHO-A11-\nA27, and CHO-A11-A279 cells in protein-free medium were comparable to serum-supplemented cultures \n(Table 4) and 2.5 to 3.5-fold enhanced when compared to previously published values for the serum-free \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     17 \nformulation (Schr\u00f6der and Friedl, 1997a). However, this increase in cellular productivity in the protein-free \nmedium was offset by lower cell densities in stationary phase, resulting in a similar accumulation of ATIII \nunder both conditions. Finally, ATIII produced by CHO-A11-A279 cells accumulated to about 30 mg\/l in \nstationary phase (Fig. 3A). This is comparable to the accumulation of urokinase-type plasminogen \nactivator secreted by CHO SSF3 cells in a protein-free environment, which reached 60-70 mg\/l in \nstationary phase (Zang et al., 1995). We conclude that the protein-free formulation is suitable for routine \nmaintenance of CHO cell lines, growth to high cell densities, and the production of recombinant proteins. \n \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     18 \n \nSchr\u00f6der, Matischak, and Friedl     19 \nConclusions \nIn this report we present serum- and protein-free media for dhfr- CHO DUKXB11 cells and recombinant \ncell lines expressing ATIII derived from CHO DUKXB11 cells. The serum-free medium has a low protein \ncontent compared to other serum-free media for CHO cells and supports growth of the cell lines \ninvestigated in this study at low and high seeding densities. Only minor changes in the medium \nformulation were necessary for its use in the cultivation of anchorage-dependent and suspension cells. \nAdaptation of cells grown in the serum-free formulation to a protein-free medium was easy and \nstraightforward. This did also result in elimination of most animal-derived components from the medium. \nFurther optimization of this medium formulation should try to replace the peptone used in this study with a \ndefined set of amino acids and peptides. In addition, the combination of having a dhfr- cell line adapted to \nserum- and even protein-free conditions at hand, may provide a reference point for the development of \nrecombinant CHO cell lines that either grow in suspension or are anchorage-dependent. The ease with \nwhich the suspension cell line CHO-SS3-A2, which was maintained in another serum-free medium prior to \nculture in CHO-T1-SF medium (B\u00fcntemeyer et al., 1991), was adapted to CHO-T1-SF medium suggests \nthat our medium formulation may be useful in the cultivation of other CHO cell lines. \nAcknowledgments \nWe thank Prof. J.
