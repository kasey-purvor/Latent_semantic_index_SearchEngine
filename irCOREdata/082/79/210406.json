This paper develops a framework for \nCEA and cost-effectiveness analysis to provide information for organisations responsible for \nstrategic commissioning of health services for defined populations and illustrates its use by \nmodelling intensive glucose control in type 1 diabetes in England.  Strategic commissioners (or \npurchasers) have emerged in reforms of health care, which are required to assess needs of \npopulations, determine the optimal way of meeting these needs, and accordingly contract with \nproviders of different services.  This is currently the task of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in the \nNational Health Service (NHS) in England [6] and Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs)  \nin Ontario  [7].  The second section of this paper outlines the framework we have developed to \nhelp strategic commissioners set priorities.  The third section illustrates how this framework was \nused in modelling type 1 diabetes.  The final section discusses the results and implications of \nour framework for disease modelling.\nFramework of analysis\nThe mainstream evaluation framework in economic evaluation for priority setting is that of \nQuality-Adjusted Life Years ([8, 9]; see [10, 11] for a review of proposed, albeit less \nwidespread alternatives). A Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a year weighted for quality \nof life, with a weight of one for perfect health and zero for death.  QALYs are used to compare \nalternative interventions and to prioritize cost-effective interventions for funding. The cost-\neffectiveness of an intervention is measured by the ratio between its added value in terms of \nhealth benefits and its incremental cost compared to an alternative, the \u201cincremental cost-\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n3\neffectiveness ratio\u201d or simply \u201ccost\/QALY\u201d. Interventions with a lower cost\/QALY represent \nbetter value for money because a smaller investment is needed to produce a unit of benefit or, \nalternatively, more QALYs can be achieved per unit spent. A different measurement tool that \nraised a heated debate is the concept of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to estimate the \nBurden of Disease (BoD) in a population [12-17]. DALYs are a form of summary measures of \npopulation health and combine information on mortality and morbidity (for a review of \nalternative measures see [18]) and consist of the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from \npremature mortality and Years Lived with a Disability (YLDs), in which each year of life is \nweighted for disability with a weight of zero for perfect health and one for death.    These \ndifferent approaches have subsequently been developed to converge to produce information on \ncosts and benefits of interventions in the population in terms of reductions in BoD measured in \nDALYs [19-21], or gains in health, measured in QALYs [22-25].  \nBeside common serious methodological, ethical and empirical problems [10, 18], each \napproach, as originally developed, was subject to different limitations as bases for setting \npriorities. The methodology of Cost\/QALY was designed for marginal analysis: it does not \ndistinguish interventions of low cost and low benefit from those of high cost and high benefit; \ndoes not tell us whether the bulk of resources are being currently used effectively [26, 27]; nor \nthe number of people affected by an intervention.  The value of reporting on the scale of the \nintervention has been highlighted by Murray and Lopez [17]: \u201cIf there are fixed assets, other \nthan disposable dollars, limiting the feasible combinations of interventions that can be delivered \n\u2013 real-world examples include the attention of senior Ministry of Health decision-makers or the \npolitical commitment of government leaders \u2013, then these should be devoted not just to the most \ncost-effective interventions but to those cost-effective interventions with the potential to effect \nsubstantial improvements in population health status\u2019. The standard approach to estimating BoD \nin DALYs, however, gives estimates of that which exists given the current delivery of health \ncare, and hence is best described as the \u2018current\u2019 BoD.    Estimates of the current BoD in \nDALYs are of no value in themselves, nor a good guide on the potential benefit from an \nintervention.  Hollinghurst et al.  [28] estimate the current BoD and the potential benefits from \ninterventions in the South West of England.  Estimates varied greatly across different diseases  \nand showed  that, although the current BoD of heart diseases was higher than that of depression, \nthe DALYs that are potentially avoidable by improving treatment of depression were much \nmore than those of improving treatment of heart diseases.  To set priorities using DALYs, we \nrequire information on benefits and costs, but to interpret the relationship between DALYs and \ncosts, we need to distinguish between estimates of three different components of BoD [28-30]: \n(i) DALYs \u2018avoided\u2019 from the current delivery of health care which with their costs indicate \ncost-effectiveness of current practice; (ii) DALYs \u2018avoidable\u2019 through improving treatment \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n4\n(coverage, appropriateness or compliance) which need to be put alongside estimates of their \ncosts to indicate potential cost-effectiveness of changing practices; and (iii) DALYs that are \n\u2018unavoidable\u2019 and cannot be reduced given current evidence, and are hence irrelevant to \nassessments of setting priorities among available interventions. \nTo set priorities for populations we require methods that draw on both cost\/QALY and DALYs \nby applying the framework of cost-effectiveness to populations in order to estimate the \n\u2018avoidable\u2019 burden of disease [29].  The concept of \u2018avoidable\u2019 burden of disease builds on the \nidea of using \u2018avoidable mortality\u2019 to assess the use of resources among different health care \nservices [31-33] and combines it with DALYs to estimate both mortality and morbidity \navoidable through an intervention. This has been the common basis for three different recent \nsets of studies: cost-effectiveness of treating mental illness in Australia [34]; WHO\u2019s project for \nChoosing Interventions that are Cost Effective [21, 27, 35]; and estimates of NHS productivity \nthat sought to estimate gains in QALYs for the population of England [23-25, 36].\nTo deal with costs and health benefits occurring at different points in time, manuals of cost-\neffectiveness recommend the use of a common discount rate, but acknowledge that theory and \nempirical evidence on the relationship between interest rates and rates of time preference is \nunsettled. For strategic commissioners, the cost-effectiveness of a health intervention based on \nits derived present value is difficult to interpret and use: they are allocated annual budgets and \ncannot easily translate results from economic evaluation on the financial impacts in the short \nand in the long term. This is nicely illustrated by intensive glucose control for type 1 diabetes.  \nThis is because, although some evidence suggests that over the patient\u2019s lifetime this is more \ncost-effective than conventional care [37-40], its funding will cause an immediate increase in \ncosts and delayed benefits. This paper proposes a different approach by measuring impacts on \npopulation health and on the commissioner\u2019s budget in the short- and long-run. \nModelling type 1 diabetes\nThe Disease and Interventions \nDiabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases and the diabetic population in \nEngland is estimated to be about 2.2 million  [41].  Of these, 2 million have type 2 diabetes, \nwhich is characterised by insulin resistance and usually diagnosed in the middle aged or elderly; \nand about 170,000 have type 1 diabetes, which is characterised by an absolute deficiency of \ninsulin and is usually of rapid onset.\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n5\nThe evidence is that only a minority of people with type 1 diabetes have blood-glucose \nconcentrations below the recommended levels (Figure 1) [42]; there is a well-known association \nbetween poor glucose control and the development of microvascular complications, i.e. eye, \nkidney and nerve damages that could lead to blindness, dialysis and amputation [40, 43, 44]\nhence, these people are expected to develop complications. A large longitudinal study has \nshown, however, that it is possible to reduce the levels of glucose concentration by providing \nintensive and personalized advice on insulin doses, diet and exercise and that, over time, this \nleads to a significant reduction in microvascular complications [40, 43, 44].  There is also some \nevidence that the intervention is cost-effective according to standard economic evaluation both \nin type 1 [37-40] and in type 2 diabetes [e.g. 45, 46]. However, microvascular complications are \nprogressive, appear after several years after the onset of diabetes and tend to degenerate over \ntime. The typically degenerative nature of these complications poses a particular challenge in \ndesigning policies for these patients: those who already have moderate complications will have \nlimited benefits from intensive glucose therapy, as the damage is already present and cannot \nusually be reversed; the full benefits are for those who receive intensive glucose control from \nthe early stages of their diabetes only, but there are long time lags between the start of the \ntherapy and its benefits in terms of reduced complications. \n----------------Figure 1 Proportion of type 1 diabetes population with glucose levels within the \nrecommended level, by age group----------\nModelling requirements of our framework \nOur framework required estimates of the BoD from type 1 diabetes that is \u2018avoidable\u2019 through \nintensive glucose control by modelling the relationships between better glycaemic control and: \nreduced risks of developing renal, eye or neural complications; and slower progression from \nmild to severe stages after the onset of the complication; and lower mortality rates.  We required\nestimates of the current BoD and that which is \u2018avoidable\u2019 from in terms of:\n\uf0b7 Deaths;\n\uf0b7 Years of Life Lost (YLLs) \u2013 the residual life expectancy at the age of the \u2018avoidable\u2019 \ndeath according to local life tables; and\n\uf0b7 Years Lived with a Disability (YLDs) using disability weights developed by the Dutch \nDisability Weight study [47]; \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n6\n\uf0b7 DALYs (the sum of YLLs and YLDs), with and without discounting, using a 3.5% \ndiscount rate [48].\nWe also required estimates of average annual net costs of:\n\uf0b7 expenditure each year, for the whole of the diabetic population, drugs, equipment; \nmonthly specialist visits and measurement of HbA1c , less \n\uf0b7 savings due to intensive glucose control from reductions in the costs of treating the \nsequelae of diabetes, renal disease (including dialysis), eye disease, and diabetic foot \n(including amputation).\nWe also required estimates of the short- and long-run impacts of intensive glucose control:\n\uf0b7 over the next five years, assuming a policy in which intensive glucose control  was \nintroduced for all patients regardless of the stage of their disease, in which we modelled\nchanges in the current population from aging and death, but omitted births (this is \nknown as a \u2018closed population model\u2019); and \n\uf0b7 in the long run, in a future \u2018steady state\u2019, in which all patients would have intensive \nglucose control at the onset of the disease, in which we modelled a population cohort of \nnew cases of different ages and simulated changes over time by assuming that the total \nsize and age distribution of the population was stable.  \nAlthough five years was an arbitrary choice, it reflects a period between the immediate and long \nrun and corresponds to the time horizon recommended for strategic planning in the English \nNHS (supplemented by yearly reviews) and is similar to the Ontarian 4-year typical time \nhorizon with yearly reviews.  The steady state scenario gives indications of the expected annual \nhealth benefits and costs for a stable intervention and has been used in the past to evaluate \nservices with long time lags as diabetes [49, 50].\nTo compare the health benefits with the net cost of the intervention, we attached a monetary \nvalue to life. We assumed a theoretical equivalence between a year of life in full health and a \nyear of life free of disability [51] and used the putative threshold of the National Institute for \nhealth and Clinical Excellence, which on average judges cost-effective a health intervention that \ncosts less than \u00a330k per QALY. We ran a sensitivity analysis on the value of health benefits. \nIn this paper we investigate the adequacy of a simple disease model within our framework of \nanalysis. To be useful for informing strategic commissioning, we required a transparent, simple \nmodel, using routinely-available data, that would produce approximate estimates that would \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n7\nindicate orders of magnitude for comparison with other interventions within and across different \ndiseases at the population level. Most of the diabetes models that have been developed \nunderstandably focus on type 2 diabetes (based on the pioneering work by Eastman and \ncolleagues [45, 52]), but some like the Archimedes, the CORE or the EAGLE model are \ndesigned for both type 1 and 2 [53-55]. We tested the adequacy of our model through \nvalidation, sensitivity analysis and comparing results with those from more sophisticated \nmodels. The model we developed is requisite for our purpose and parsimonious  [56, 57].\nWe modelled diabetes as a Markov chain, which makes the simplifying assumption that the \nprobability of transition from disease state A to disease state B does not depend on the patient\u2019s \nhistory before arriving in state A. However, the incidence of microvascular complications \ncorrelates significantly with diabetes duration [58]; we divided the population in 5-year age \ngroups to allow the use of a different set of transition probabilities for each one. The probability \nof death is dependent both on age and degree of severity of complication. The incidence of \ncomplications and their progression rates vary with age, but as there are no routinely available \ndata on these, we assumed no incidence of microvascular complications before the age of 15 \nand lower incidence rates in young adults compared to older ones. The specifications for the two \nmodels are outlined in Figure 2.  A description of the key assumptions and an evaluation of the \ndata are given in Tables 1 and 2.  We estimated the BoD: from higher mortality (deaths and \nYLLs) from all causes; and disability (YLDs) associated with microvascular complications, \ndiabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and diabetic foot; but not from acute diabetic events \n(ketoacidosis), non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes and coronary \nrevascularisations. Although we did not model patients with cerebrovascular complications \nexplicitly, deaths caused by these complications are accounted in the YLLs from all causes.\nThe model can be run for any local population and we have used it for England, ten different \nPCTs in the South-East of England and two PCTs in central London. However, the \ndemographic differences across these PCTs did not have a significant impact on the relative \nmagnitude of results. In this paper we discuss estimates for the population of England.\n----------------Figure 2 Base structure of the model for diabetic nephropathy (left) and diabetic \nretinopathy & diabetic foot (right)---------------------\n-------------Table 1 Main model assumptions-----------\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n8\nFirst five years\nThe model of the first five years tracked 100 birth cohorts, i.e. the population from ages 0 to 99 \nover five consecutive years.

These were derived using data on the 2003 population in England [59] and \nprevalence estimates published by Harvey et al. [60].  We did not find data on the distribution \nof the population with type 1 diabetes (A(0,j)) in terms of degrees of severity by age of renal and \neye complication.  We estimated these distributions by generating a hypothetical birth cohort of \n100,000 persons and simulating their aging, deaths and progression to and through diabetes over \n100 years.  The dynamic of the hypothetical cohort was modelled with a Markov-chain model \nthat used the same transition probabilities of the main model presented in this paper.  We \nassumed that the proportion of diabetic patients with degree of severity s at period t of the \nhypothetical cohort simulation was representative of the proportion of diabetic patients aged t in \nthe current English diabetic population. We subject the resulting initial condition to validation.\nFigure 2 outlines the progression of type 1 diabetes in the stages of nephropathy (left panel) and \nretinopathy (right panel). The stages of nephropathy are: \n\uf0b7 microalbuminuria, i.e. an increased concentration of the protein \u2018albumina\u2019 in the urine;\n\uf0b7 macroalbuminuria, i.e. overt proteinuria or \u2018clinical nephropathy\u2019, and \n\uf0b7 end stage renal disease (ESRD). \nEach of these stages is also associated with increased mortality rates, mainly due to \ncardiovascular disease [61-64]; and these are particularly high for macroalbuminuria [65, 66]. \nThe progression of retinopathy to blindness is also associated with a higher mortality rate \ncompared to the non-diabetic population. The effect of glycaemic control was modelled through \ntransition probabilities \uf067, which are lower for diabetic patients under intensive glucose control \ncompared to conventional care, which means there is a slower progression of the disease to and \nthrough microvascular complications (see Appendix).\nThe retinopathy model also estimated the BoD from ulcers, sores and amputation using the \nincidence rates of these complications associated with different degrees of retinopathy [67] (see \nAppendix). The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT study) does not report the \nreduction in lower extremity amputation rates. We built on the association between degrees of \nseverity in retinopathy and lower extremity amputation [67]. We made two assumptions: first, \npoor glucose control is an underlying cause of both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic foot; \nsecond, the association between degree of severity of retinopathy and diabetic foot is the same \nin the intensive glucose control and in the conventional treatment group (keeping constant the \nprovision of other treatments, e.g. laser treatment). For instance, the 4-year incidence of lower \nextremity amputation is 7.8% in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n11\nHowever, fewer people have PDR with intensive glucose monitoring and control than with \nconventional therapy.  The model we built did not model neuropathy and diabetic foot explicitly \nand would be unsuitable to measure the impact of other specific interventions (e.g. changes in \nlaser therapy).\nThere are interdependencies among all complications that cannot be represented in a simple \nspreadsheet model like ours (to represent them, the CORE model builds on fourteen sub-models \nand the Archimedes model generates the biology of a virtual patient directly rather than \nmodelling distinct health states).  We combined the nephropathy and retinopathy\/diabetic foot \nmodels to estimate YLLs and YLDs from type 1 diabetes as follows:  \n\uf0b7 YLLs based on deaths from the nephropathy model, because albuminuria is the best \npredictor of all-cause mortality in type 1 diabetes [65]. These deaths includes those \nfrom macrovascular complications such as myocardial infarctions and strokes;\n\uf0b7 YLDs from the nephropathy model (for macroalbuminuria and ESRD);\n\uf0b7 YLDs from the retinopathy-diabetic foot model (for uncomplicated type 1 diabetes, \nmoderate and severe visual impairments, sores, ulcers and lower extremity amputation.\nThe current BoD and health gains from reduced non-fatal macrovascular complications have not \nbeen estimated here.\nThe steady-state \nThe model of the steady-state estimated the BoD of type 1 diabetes for one year with a set of \ninitial conditions A(j,s) based on the age specific profile of a hypothetical birth cohort modelled \nover 100 years using again equations (2) and (3) for modelling transitions in the population with \nand without type 1 diabetes. The differences from the model for the first five years are the \nassumptions that: the size of the population does not change (as those who die are replaced with \nindividuals of the same age); and that the hypothetical cohort has received intensive treatment \nfrom the onset of type 1 diabetes, and hence has also been subject to lower transition \nprobabilities from the onset of the disease.  In this model, the number of diabetic patients in \neach age group is the same as in the initial population of the model for the first five years, but \nthey all have blood glucose under the recommended level and fewer of them have developed \ncomplications.  The \u2018steady state\u2019 model reflectes the delay between the intervention and its full \nbenefits, estimating the reduction in burden of disease as if the current diabetic population was \nsubject to treatment from the onset of diabetes and does not take into account recent predictions \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n12\nof increasing future incidence rates [41].  It therefore underestimates the likely future burden of \ndisease.  The initial population of the steady state model is a stable population, where everybody \nhas blood glucose below the recommended level.  At the end of the year the population \nprogresses according to transition probabilities characteristic of diabetic patients with glycaemic \ncontrol.\nEstimates of BoD in DALYs were estimated by equation (4) (using the same notation as \nequation (1)):\n\uf03d\uf02b\uf03d YLDsYLLsDALYs\n\uf02b\uf03d \uf0e5\uf0e5 \uf0f2\n\uf03d \uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n99\n0 0\n)1(\n1\n),('*),(\nj\nk\ns\njL\nrt dtesjsjA \uf06d \uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf03d\n\uf02d\n99\n0 0\n*)(*),(\nj\nk\ns\nreswsjA \u2026\u2026\u2026..(4)\nData\nAs most death certificates of diabetic patients do not report diabetes as a cause of death, official \nstatistics that report causes of mortality are unreliable for diabetes.  So we estimated mortality \nfrom diabetes using mortality rates from longitudinal studies [63, 65] and prevalence data from \nHarvey et al [60].  We estimated the presence and degree of severity of complications using the \nbest evidence we could find, including studies conducted in the US or the Netherlands.  A \nsystematic review of the evidence, although needed and valuable, was beyond the scope of this \npaper.  Details on the assumptions needed to deal with missing data are given in the last column \nof Table 2.\n------------Table 2 Data sources and assumptions on missing data-------------------\nThe benefits of intensive glucose control are the difference between estimates of BoD with and \nwithout the intervention. In the absence of evidence on the level of disability from co-morbid \nconditions (e.g. retinopathy and nephropathy affecting the same person), we assumed that the \ndisability from renal complications could be meaningfully added to the disability from eye and \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n13\nfoot complications, that is, for instance, the disability of a patient with both nephropathy and \nsevere retinopathy contributes 0.29+0.43 YLDs (0.72 YLDs).  For comparison, this means that \na year spent with diabetic nephropathy and severe visual impairments would have the same \ndisability weight as, e.g., schizophrenia with several psychotic episodes and some permanent \nimpairments, or a year of a child\/adolescent in permanent stage with complex not curatively \noperable congenital heart disease.   Patients with all three complications at the highest degree of \nseverity would contribute 0.91 YLDs (0.29+0.43+0.19). \nOur estimates of the potential net gain in output from intensive glucose control are based on \nestimated unit costs as outlined in Table 3 and Table 4.\n-------------Table 3 Cost of monitoring glucose levels and prescribing insulin--------------\nThese costs assume the definition of intensive glucose control as it occurred in the original \nlongitudinal study consisted of administration of insulin at least three times a day (or with an \ninsulin pump); insulin dosage, dietary intake and exercise adjustment according to results of \nself-monitoring of blood glucose; self-monitoring of blood glucose at least four times per day; \nmonthly measurement of HbA1c; monthly visit at the diabetic centre; and specialist calls during \nthe month to review regimens. We ran three sensitivity analyses of our estimates of costs. First, \nwe replaced monthly clinic visits with telephone calls from a specialist nurse, which is a more \nrealistic assumption of what might happen outside research conditions and does not appear to \nreduce health benefits [68]. Second, we assumed the use of insulin pumps rather than multiple \ndaily injections (although there is some evidence that insulin pumps are clinically more \neffective than multiple daily injections, most of the benefit is in terms of hypoglycaemic events \nor practical convenience and would not significantly affect microvascular complications). Third, \nwe allowed for the cost of treating a diabetic patient to be about 30% higher than a non-diabetic \none and about 27% above the average cost for the general population [69]. \n--------------Table 4 Cost of treating microvascular complications----------------\nResults \nHealth gains\nTable 5 and the following Figures report annualised estimates for various measures of \nreductions in BoD and gains in DALYs.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n14\nThe yearly estimates of the current BoD from type 1 diabetes in England was about 2,000 \ndeaths; 66,000 YLLs and 34,000 YLDs; 100,000 undiscounted and 63,000 discounted DALYs. \nIn the first five years and the steady state the estimated benefits from intensive glucose control \nare reductions in the BoD of about: 10 and 400 deaths; 300 and 11,000 YLLs; 1,200 and 11,000 \nYLDs; and 1,500 and 24,000 undiscounted DALYs; and 1,200 and 18,000 discounted DALYs.  \nThese are underestimates of the benefits as they do not include reductions in BoD from acute \ndiabetes events (ketoacidosis), non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes and coronary \nrevascularisations, and this qualification also applies to our estimates of the monetary valuation \nof these benefits.  \n---------------------Table 5 Burden of Disease and its reduction through intensive glucose control \nin the first five years and in the steady-state--------------\nFigure 3 shows the BoD in undiscounted DALYs from type 1 diabetes and the estimated \nreductions in the first five years and in the steady state from intensive glucose control.  This \nshows that much of the current BoD from type 1 diabetes is unavoidable even with 100% \ncompliance with intensive glucose control.

All these Figures bring out the common message that the benefits of intensive control \nappear to be much greater in the long run than the short run.  \n-----------Figure 3 Estimates of BoD (undiscounted DALYs) from type 1 diabetes and reductions \nin the first five years and steady state from intensive glucose control-----------\n-----------------Figure 4 \u2018Avoidable\u2019 deaths through intensive glucose control in the first five \nyears and in the steady state by age at the beginning of the intervention---------------\n-----------------Figure 5 \u2018Avoidable\u2019 cases of overt proteinuria and end-stage renal disease \nthrough intensive glucose control in the first five years and in the steady state by age at the \nbeginning of the intervention------------\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n15\n-----------Figure 6 \u2018Avoidable\u2019 cases of severe visual disorders through intensive glucose \ncontrol in the first five years and in the steady state by age at the beginning of the intervention\n----------------Figure 7 \u2018Avoidable\u2019 cases of amputation through intensive glucose control in the \nfirst five years and in the steady state by age at the beginning of the intervention------------\nNet costs and net gains in output\nWe estimated that:\n\uf0b7 the annual cost to prescribe, monitor and treat microvascular complications of diabetes \ntype 1 in England is currently about \u00a3380m (most of which is spent on monitoring the \ndisease, prescribing insulin and treating renal complications (Table 6));\n\uf0b7 the introduction of intensive monitoring increases the cost of insulin prescribing and \nmonitoring by \u00a3350m and reduces the annual costs of complications by \u00a320m in the \nfirst five years; and by \u00a3370m and \u00a3100m respectively in the steady state; \n\uf0b7 reductions in costs for eye diseases are mainly realized in the short run (\u00a38m compared \nwith long-run savings of \u00a312m);\n\uf0b7 reductions in costs for renal complications are mainly realized in the long run (\u00a384m \ncompared with short-run savings of \u00a313m).  \n------------Table 6 Annual costs and savings (negative figures) from intensive glucose control in \nthe first five years and the steady state-----------\nThe estimates of costs and savings of intensive glucose control in the long run are of what these \nwould be in a year: i.e. we have not examined these using discounting.  If the savings were \ndiscounted, these would be negligible because of the long time lags between the start of \nincurring the costs of intensive glucose control and making these savings from reduced use of \nhealth services.  In our estimates, the expected savings from reduced complication do not offset \nthe increased cost for monitoring and prescribing.  There is, however, evidence that these costs \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n16\ncan be reduced. It is not necessary to have monthly visits to the diabetic clinic: a telephone \ndiscussion with a specialist nurse three times a week to adjust insulin dose and diet to the \nobserved glucose levels was successful in reducing HbA1c below the recommended level at six \nmonths [68].  This practice would reduce the extra costs to about \u00a3270m and hence extra net \ncosts to about \u00a3180m in the steady state.  \nWe used these costs in Table 7, which gives results from comparing costs and benefits in the \nshort and in the long run.  This shows that the net cost of intensive glucose control in the short \nrun are about six times larger than the monetary value of the health benefits.  If the intervention \nwere to be introduced and sustained over its run-in period, however, the monetary value of \nhealth benefits would be three times the net cost of the intervention.\n--------------Table 7 Net gain in output in the first five years and in the steady state-----------\nModel validity\nAssessing the validity of our model is difficult, because routinely available data usually refers to \ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes combined (even when these labels are used, most patients belong to \nan \u2018unspecified\u2019 type of diabetes).  The available combined figures are likely to be a reflection \nof prevalence and incidence rates of diabetes type 2, which is about 90% of the diabetic \npopulation and is not representative of the population with type 1. In fact, type 1 typically has a \nmuch younger onset compared to diabetes type 2 and the duration of diabetes is one of the main \nrisk factors of complications. Where data on type 1 diabetes exist, usually either there is no \nbreakdown by age, or data are not for England, or they are not routinely available and hence \ncould not be used as input for our initial condition. We now discuss how we compared the \nprevalence of complications resulting from our initial condition with data from the literature. \nDiabetic nephropathy\nTable 8 compares prevalence rates of renal complications by degree of severity in our model \nand in the literature. Our estimates are generally consistent with data from empirical analysis, \nalthough we might overestimate the prevalence of end stage renal disease. The Renal Registry \nin England estimates that 30,000 people are receiving renal replacement therapy (including \nthose who received a kidney transplant) and 5,000 started  renal replacement therapy in 2002 \n[70]. Our model estimates that there are about 6,000 people with End Stage Renal disease and \n1,000 new cases per year among patients with type 1 diabetes which would correspond to about \n16% and 20% respectively of all patients receiving renal replacement therapy. This might be an \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n17\noverestimate and we will indicate the health benefits and cost component separately for ESRD \nin the result section for transparency.\n--------------Table 8 Prevalence rates of renal complications----------------\nDiabetic retinopathy\nEstimates of diabetic retinopathy for the population with type 1 diabetes vary greatly. A recent\nliterature review on prevalence reports rates between 0 and 84% for diabetic retinopathy in \ngeneral; and between 1.1% and 25% for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy [71]. We report in \nTable 9 the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the WESDR study (which we used as a basis \nof our model) and the estimated prevalence based on the model by Davies et al. [72] who used \nthe same dataset. Table 9 shows that our estimates are reasonable, once we assume the WESDR \ndata can be used for England. Furthermore, the 9-year cumulative incidence of background \ndiabetic retinopathy in our model is 81%, which is similar to estimates from the EAGLE model \n(77%), which also uses the WESDR study [73]. \n--------------Table 9  Prevalence rates of eye complications----------------\nDiabetic foot\nHealth Episode Statistics (HES) report a total of 10,700 finished consultant episodes (FCEs) of \namputation, including traumatic amputations and procedures associated with diabetic foot such \nas amputation of stumps. Our model predicts about 1,300 cases of amputation a year in the \npopulation with type 1 diabetes (toe and foot amputation) which would correspond to about \n12% of all amputation procedures conducted in England (including diabetes type 2 and non-\ndiabetic patients). From the publicly available HES data we could not identify what proportion \nof the total FCEs referred to people with type 1 diabetes. Results for diabetic foot are reported \nseparately from those of renal and eye complications for transparency.\nWe compared our results with 4-year incidence rates of amputation and sores\/ulcers in Moss et \nal. (1992) and show results in Table 10. Our prevalence estimates are based on the work by \nMoss and, as one should expect, the incidence rates correspond.  It is reassuring, however, to \nobserve consistency in the overall incidence rate (last column in Table 10), which is an output \nof our model and our assumptions on those with different severities of retinopathy.\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n18\nWe did not find data on prevalence or incidence of diabetic foot for the population with type 1 \ndiabetes in England to validate the diabetic foot model externally. Our model, however, \nestimates an annual incidence of 2.8% for sores\/ulcers and 0.7% for amputation, which is \nsimilar to 2.1% and 0.6% mean national incidence rates for type 1 diabetes in the Netherlands \n[74].\n--------------Table 10   4-year incidence rates of sores\/ulcers and foot\/toe amputations ------------\n----\nIntensive glucose control\nWe compare our model estimates on the relative risk of renal and eye complications with those \nin the DCCT study and in other diabetes models from the literature in table 11. Our model is \nconsistent with the other studies in estimating the reduction in retinopathy and might slightly \noverestimate the reduction in renal complications by 15%. This overestimate does not have a \nsignificant impact on the estimate of the \u2018avoidable\u2019 Burden of Disease, which is mainly \ndetermined by a reduction in eye complications. The cost of renal complications, however, is \nthe principal component of the savings in treating complications in the intensive care scenario in \nthe steady state. Assuming a 15% lower savings from fewer renal complications, however, \nwould not have an impact on the order of magnitude of our results: the net loss in the first five \nyears would be unaffected and the net gain in the steady state would reduce from \u00a3350m to \n\u00a3330m.\nTable 11 also reports estimates in the reduction of neuropathy, but our model does not model \nthese complications explicitly. The relative risk in 9-year incidence of sores\/ulcers and \namputation in the intensive glucose control scenario is 0.95 and 0.91 which is much lower than \nthe 0.47 relative risk of neuropathy at clinical examination in the DCCT study. A reduction in \nneuropathy does not imply an equivalent reduction in diabetic foot, however, the relatively \nsmall reduction in diabetic foot estimated in our model compared to the relatively high \nreduction in neuropathy indicates that we might have underestimated the \u2018avoidable\u2019 burden of \ndisease.\n--------------Table 11 Estimates of the risk reduction in 9-year incidence from microvascular \ncomplications ----------------\nCosting\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n19\nThe estimate of the current, annual cost of monitoring, prescribing and treating microvascular \ncomplications amounts to about \u00a32,300 per patient. This is broadly consistent with a recent \nestimate of the total healthcare cost of treating people with type 1 diabetes in the UK by Currie \net al. [75]. The annual healthcare cost of participants in their survey spent about \u00a33,200 a year, \nincluding treatment and prevention of macrovascular complications such as stroke and \nmyocardial infarction.\nOur estimate for the current cost of treating renal complications and diabetic foot are also in line \nwith other estimates of the cost for type 1 diabetes in the UK. The estimate of \u00a3175m for \nnephropathy is consistent with Gordois et al. [76] estimate of \u00a3152m (range \u00a3125-230m); the \nestimate of \u00a38m for incident cases of diabetic foot seems consistent with the \u00a335m (range \u00a316-\n61m) of prevalent cases of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [77].\nSensitivity analysis \nOur estimates of health benefits assume that the transition probabilities and mortality rates \nobserved in longitudinal studies, in which the participants were generally between adolescence \nand middle age [40, 43, 44, 78-82], apply to the type 1 diabetes population in England, and the \nconfidence interval estimates of mortality rates in older cohorts are particularly wide [63]. To \ntest the robustness of the model to these assumptions, we estimated the effects of excluding \nfrom the analysis all people older than 75 years.  As this reduced these estimates by about one \nper cent, we concluded that they are robust to our assumptions of transition probabilities and \nmortality rates of older cohorts.\nA crucial assumption in our estimates of the impacts of intensive glucose control is that there is \ncompliance at levels comparable to those of the DCCT study. There is a linear relationship \nbetween the proportion complying and the reduction in BoD in DALYs. Figure 8 shows the \nestimated relationship for the steady-state model: a 1% increment in the proportion receiving \nintensive treatment and complying as in experimental conditions corresponds to a reduction of \n240 DALYs (or 180 discounted DALYs).  \n-------------------Figure 8 Estimates of annual BoD in undiscounted DALYs from type 1 diabetes\nin the steady state from 0 to 100% proportion of population complying with intensive glucose \ncontrol--------------------\nAnother assumption worth testing is that of offering intensive glucose monitoring to all patients, \nincluding children and adolescents. On one hand, DCCT researchers were cautious about the \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n20\nuse of intensive glucose monitoring in children because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemic \nevents. On the other, the low proportion of adolescents with glucose concentration below the \nrecommended level  might signal the rebellion against parental or medical authority suggesting \nthe possibility of very low compliance rates with intensive treatment. Our model, however, \nassumes that most microvascular complications arise after the age of 15 (with the exception of \nulcers which we assume occurs at any age and amputation which we assume occurs only in \npeople older than 30) and excluding these age groups from the analysis would not significantly \nimpact on the estimates of health benefits: the estimate of the \u2018avoidable\u2019 burden of disease \noffering intensive glucose control only to people aged 20 or older is just 0.1% lower both in the \nshort run and in the steady state. This result should be interpreted with caution because our \nMarkov chain assumes that the incidence of microvascular complications from the age of 15 (or \n30 for amputation) is independent from glucose concentrations maintained in childhood and we \ndid not find evidence to support or dismiss this assumption.  Clearly, however, the exclusion of \nchildren and adolescents from intensive glucose monitoring would have an impact on costs.  \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the reduction in costs by providing intensive treatment only \nto patients who are 20 years old or older is 50m in the short run and 60m in the steady state \nwhich would imply a lower loss in net output in the first five years (\u00a3170m compared to \u00a3220 in \nthe base case) and a higher net gain in output in the steady state (\u00a3410m compared to \u00a3350 in \nthe base case).\nTo test the robustness of our cost estimates, we also assumed the use of insulin pumps to replace \nthe base case assumption of multiple daily injections. There is growing interest in the use of \ninsulin pumps as an alternative treatment to manage diabetes.  In comparison with multiple \ndaily injections, insulin pumps improve quality of life in terms of their higher efficacy on \ncontrolling glucose concentration, of reducing incidence of adverse events (i.e. hypoglycaemic \nevents) and their flexibility of lifestyle. However, they are not currently considered cost-\neffective because of their higher cost [83].  If all patients use insulin pumps (using the average \nannual cost from Colquitt et al. [83]), the incremental cost of insulin prescribing and monitoring \nwould be \u00a3515m in the short run (annualized figure over first 5 years) and \u00a3547m in the steady \nstate.  This would consistently lower the net gains from Table 7; however, although this is an \nextreme and unrealistic assumption, the results would still be a loss in the short run (\u00a3470m net \nloss in output) and a gain in the steady state (\u00a375 net gain in output).\nWe also assumed a cost of acute care (inpatient and outpatient) 27% higher than the national \naverage cost [69]. Under this scenario, the estimate of the total current cost of insulin and \nmicrovascular complication increases from \u00a3370m to \u00a3515m per year; the increase in spending \nfrom intensive glucose monitoring reduces from \u00a3250m to \u00a3210m and from \u00a3180m to \u00a3105m in \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n21\nthe first five year model and in the steady state respectively assuming telephone discussion with \na specialist nurse rather than monthly visits to the diabetes clinic; from \u00a3330m to \u00a3285m and \nfrom \u00a3270m to \u00a3190m in the first five years and in the steady state model assuming monthly \nvisit as in the original DCCT study. This is as expected because the higher cost of acute care \nincreases the savings from treating microvascular complications, and this determines a lower net\nloss in the short run (\u00a3170m compared to \u00a3220m in the base case assuming monitoring with \nnurse on the phone) and a higher gain in net output in the steady state (\u00a3430m compared to \n\u00a3350m in the base case).\nWe ran a sensitivity analysis on the cost of peritoneal haemodialysis, assuming the use of \ncontinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) instead of continuous cyclic peritoneal \ndialysis (CCPD) which is cheaper although currently not considered cost-effective [84]. The \nresulting reduction in cost does not significantly affect results (\u00a3169m current cost vs. \u00a3162 in \nbase case; same reduction in short run; 76m reduction nephropathy cost in steady state vs. \u00a379 \nbase case cheap or \u00a384 base case DCCT).\nFinally we tested the monetary value of health benefits with two sensitivity analyses.  First, we \nuse a lower figure of \u00a320,000 as advocated by part of the literature [e.g. 85]. Second, we used \nthe health benefits using the value of a statistical life (HM Treasury, 2003). Both sensitivity \nanalyses confirm a net loss of more than \u00a3200m (\u00a3230 and \u00a3240 respectively) in the short run \nand a net gain above \u00a3180m in the steady-state (\u00a3180 and \u00a3260 respectively).\nDiscussion\nThis paper aimed to explore how disease models could be used in setting priorities for strategic \ncommissioning for populations. To set priorities using evidence, it is essential to estimate\nimpacts of interventions at the level of populations, but this can only be done by disease \nmodelling.  An obstacle to the use of such models is that they are often highly complex, demand \nrich sources of data, and take a long time to develop.  We have described the development of a \nparsimonious transparent model of the size and timing of costs and benefits of intensive glucose \ncontrol in the type 1 diabetes population, which has produced approximate estimates that are \nadequate for priority setting as shown by validation and sensitivity analysis. This paper has \nshown, that:\n\uf0a7 The current BoD from type 1 diabetes disease from microvascular complications and \npremature mortality is about 100,000 DALYs of which one third is attributable to low \nquality of life and two thirds to premature death. This is an underestimate of the current \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n22\nburden of disease from diabetes type 1, because it does not include disability due to \nacute diabetic events (ketoacidosis), non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes \nand coronary revascularisations.\n\uf0a7 Introducing intensive glucose control, in the short run, will almost double the spend for \nmonitoring glucose, prescribing insulin and treating microvascular complications but \nhave small effect in reducing the burden of disease (a 1-2% reduction).\n\uf0a7 Introducing intensive glucose control, in the long run, reduced the BoD by about 30%: \nwith this being approximately equally divided into benefits from lower mortality and \nlower morbidity. The lower cost of treating complications in the long run will still not \noffset the increased cost of monitoring and insulin prescribing (50% higher than \nconventional care); however, the value of the health benefits more than compensates the \nincrease in costs. \nThe study also highlighted inadequacies in the data that are routinely collected in England: \nchronic diseases, such as diabetes, are frequently not reported on death certificates thereby \nmasking the impact of long term consequences; there are significant gaps in data on the type of \ndiabetes, age of the patient, duration of diabetes, presence of complication with degree and \nduration, sex and current treatment regime. In England many of these data are in principle \navailable for purchase from the General Practice Research Database that offers a sample of \nabout 7,500-8,000 type 1 diabetes patients, that is about 4.5% of the total type 1 diabetes\npopulation [63, 64].  These data ought to be collected in disease registers to support evidence-\nbased policy making.  An initiative that has the potential to provide this information in England \nis the current national Programme for IT in the NHS, Connecting for Health.\nThe final point concerns the approach to modelling illustrated by this paper.  In setting \npriorities, information on costs and benefits in the short and long run for options for type 1 \ndiabetes is obviously insufficient.  We have applied our approach to a number of different \ninterventions: suicide prevention, treatment of depression, prescribing of statins to reduce \ncholesterol, and various options for the prevention and treatment of strokes [86].  In all this \nwork, it seems to us that relatively simple models, similar to that in this paper described for type\n1 diabetes have been adequate in making comparisons for setting priorities for strategic \ncommissioning. Indeed we see the key next step as not the development of more complex \nmodels for each of these but developing a simple method to generate adequate estimates for the \nwide range of interventions that must be considered by strategic commissioners.\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n23\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n24\nAppendix\nModel parameters\n------- Table A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5  about here -------------------------\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n25\nReferences\n1.

To relax this \nassumption we divide the population in 5-year \nage groups and use a different set of transition \nprobabilities for each one if data was available.\nSame rates apply to men and women. With the exception of myocardial infarction \ncomplication rates are similar in men and women \n(National Clinical Audit Support Programme, \n2005). \nUnder the intervention scenario, all the diabetic \npopulation is subject to intensive treatment.\nThis reflects NICE recommendations to maintain \nHbA1c\uf0a37.5% in all diabetic patients, but will \noverstate the benefit of the intervention.  We \nused sensitivity analysis on compliance rates to \ntest this assumption.\nTable\nTable 2 Data sources and assumptions on missing data\nInformation Source Description\/Evaluation Assumptions on missing data\nIncidence\n\uf061\n(National \nClinical \nAudit \nSupport \nProgramme, \n2005)\nThis is an overview of diabetes \nand diabetes care in England. \nCoverage is partial: about 22% of \neligible PCTs, GP practices and \nHospitals registered; about 34% \nof paediatric units.\nIt gives data for 0-16 years old.\nWe assumed diabetes onset is \nbefore age 35 using the incidence \nrate for 0-16 also for people 17-35 \nyears old.  This assumption implies \na slight overestimate of the burden \nof diabetes in the model for the \nfirst five years.\nWe made the standard assumption \nthat all Type 1diabetic patients are \ndiagnosed.\nCurrent \npopulation \nwith Type 1 \nDiabetes by \nage group \nA(0,j)\n(Harvey et \nal., 2002, \nDiabetes UK, \n2004b, a, \nHealth and \nSocial Care \nInformation \nCentre, \n2004);\ndetails for \n(Health and \nSocial Care \nInformation \nCentre, \n2004)\nprovided by \nNHS \u2013\nHealth and \nSocial Care \nInformation \nCentre\n(Diabetes UK, 2004b) gives \nestimates for the 17,000 children \nwith Type 1 Diabetes which are \nbased on audited data of about \n10,000 children.\n(Diabetes UK, 2004a) estimates \nthe diabetic population but in \nwide age bands.\n(Health and Social Care \nInformation Centre, 2004) is the \nQOF data at GP level (carefully \naudited as the basis for the new \nGMS contract) and reports the \ntotal number of diabetic patients \nin the surgery (but lacks details \non type of diabetes and age).\n(Harvey et al., 2002) reports age-\nspecific prevalence estimates of \nType 1 Diabetes for the County \nof Clwyd in North Wales.\nThere is no single definitive source \nof audited prevalence data of Type \n1 Diabetes for all age groups.\nWe used the (Harvey et al., 2002).  \nThis assumes that the estimates are \nrepresentative for England.\nInformation Source Description\/Evaluation Assumptions on missing data\nNumber of \npeople by \ndegree of \nseverity s\n(Klein et al., \n1989b, a, \nKlein et al., \n1989c, \nDiabetes \nControl and \nComplication \nTrial, 1990, \n1993, Klein\net al., 1994, \nDiabetes \nControl and \nComplication \nTrial, 1996, \nRossing et \nal., 1996, \nBrailsford et \nal., 1998, \nKlein et al., \n1998, Davies\net al., 2001, \nNiessen, \n2002, \nSoedamah-\nMuthu et al., \n2006a)\nThese data do not refer to the \nEnglish population and some are \nten years old.  Most of these \nsources report transition \nprobabilities based on \nlongitudinal studies but the \noriginal dataset of the study is \nnot available.  Data are usually \nreported for the whole population \nin the study or for wide age \ngroups.\nWe needed to make some heroic \nassumptions to generate the initial \ndistribution of diabetic population \nacross degrees of severity of renal \nand eye disease complications.\nWe used our model to generate a \nsample population of 100,000 \nsusceptible and projected it over \n100 years.  We assumed that the \nproportion of people in each degree \nof severity for each age was \nrepresentative of the current \npopulation of that age.
