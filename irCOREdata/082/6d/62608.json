A transform margin \nalong its northern side accommodated a 1400 km offset between the continent-ocean \nboundary on the Argentine shelf and that to the east of Maurice Ewing Bank during the \nopening of this ocean, which commenced at about 130 Ma (Fig. 1b). Antarctica rifted away \nfrom the southern side of the Falkland Plateau at about 145 Ma (Jokat et al. 2003), and the \nScotia Sea has developed on this side of the plateau in the last 30 Ma as a result of extension \nbehind an eastward-migrating subduction zone. Burdwood Bank and the North Scotia Ridge \nare continental fragments along the northern edge of the Scotia Plate, which is converging \nobliquely (in a sinistral sense) with the South American Plate and overriding it such that the \nsouthern edge of the Falkland Plateau has flexed downward to form the Falkland Trough (Bry \net al. 2004). \nOnshore paleomagnetic (Taylor & Shaw 1989), stratigraphic (Marshall, 1994; Trewin et al. \n2002) and structural (Curtis & Hyam 1998) observations suggest that the Falkland Islands \nrotated through up to 180\u00ba in a clockwise direction during the break-up of Gondwana, from \nan original position adjacent to the east coast of Southern Africa. After allowing for \nsubsequent relative plate motion, clockwise tectonic rotation of a Falkland Islands microplate \nthrough about 120\u00ba is implied. There is, however, little evidence for rotation and docking in \nthe sedimentary sequences imaged in the offshore area (Richards et al. 1996). If the Falkland \nPlateau is composed of rotated Gondwanan fragments, then these must have been assembled \n 1 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nafter the intrusion of the Early Jurassic dykes on the Falkland Islands (which provide the key \npalaeomagnetic evidence for such rotation) and before the deposition of the major \nsedimentary sequences in the offshore basins. Storey et al. (1999) argue that rotation was \nrapid, commencing at the time of Karoo-Ferrar magmatism at c. 183 Ma and complete by \nabout 175 Ma. They suggest that it was facilitated by doming and the development of a \nviscously deforming substratum above the mantle plume responsible for this magmatism. \nEvidence regarding the deep structure of the Falkland Plateau is limited, but the prevalent \nview has been that its central part is underlain by normal thickness oceanic crust (Ludwig \n1983; Barker 1999). In this paper we present the results of three-dimensional modelling based \non gravity data (Fig. 1c) that challenge this view. We propose that there is a much greater \ncrustal thickness beneath the plateau and that this reflects the influence of Karoo-Ferrar \nmagmatism on its evolution.  \nSedimentary cover \nFigure 2a is a map of sedimentary thickness that has been compiled from a variety of sources. \nMuch of the information comes from a series of seismic cruises conducted by the Lamont-\nDoherty Geological Observatory in the 1960s and 1970s. These included seismic refraction \n(airgun-sonobuoy) experiments and single- and multi-channel seismic reflection profiling. \nProfiles 139 to 145 (labelled in Fig. 1 and superimposed on subsequent figures) are \nparticularly valuable in providing both multichannel reflection images of the sedimentary \ncover (Lorenzo & Mutter 1988) and insights from refraction measurements into the velocity \nstructure of the basins and underlying basement (Ludwig 1983). Such data have previously \nbeen incorporated in sediment thickness maps (e.g. Divins & Rabinowitz 1990) which have \nbeen compiled and digitised by the US National Geophysical Data Centre \n(http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/mgg\/sedthick\/sedthick.html). Additional sources employed in \nFig. 2a included Lorenzo & Mutter (1988), Turic et al. (1980) and Bry et al. (2004).  \nThere are four main basins around the Falkland Islands: the Falkland Plateau Basin, South \nFalkland Basin, Malvinas Basin and North Falkland Basin (Fig. 2a; Richards et al. 1996). \nThese are inferred to have been initiated by Early to Mid Jurassic rifting associated with the \nbreak-up of Gondwana. Lorenzo & Mutter (1988) estimated that extension took place within \nthe Falkland Plateau Basin during the Mid Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, whereas Marshall \n(1994) placed the main extensional phase in the Early Jurassic. Richards et al. (1996) noted \nthat the major extensional faults appear to terminate upwards at about top Jurassic level and \nraised the possibility that extension occurred as early as the Permo-Triassic. The Falkland \nPlateau Basin contains a large thickness of sedimentary rocks, probably exceeding 10 km on \nits western side (Fig. 2; Richards et al. 1996; Bry et al. 2004). \nBasement \nDirect evidence for the continental nature of Maurice Ewing Bank is provided by the \nmetamorphic basement drilled at DSDP Site 330 (Fig. 1; Barker et al. 1976). These rocks \nhave not been accurately dated, but the lithologies (gneiss, granitoids) and isotopic \ncompositions are similar to those found in the Mesoproterozoic (c. 1.1 Ga) Cape Meredith \nComplex, which is exposed on the southern tip of West Falkland (Wareham et al. 1998; \nJacobs et al. 1999; Thomas et al. 2000). They were formed within a Grenville-age juvenile \nisland arc which extended from southern Africa through the Falkland region and into East \nAntarctica (Wareham et al. 1998; Thomas et al. 2000). Gneissic continental basement rocks \nhave also been found in dredge hauls along the top of the Falkland Escarpment, although \nsuch hauls also include basaltic rocks (Lorenzo & Mutter 1988; Lorenzo & Wessel 1997). \nFurther evidence for the continental nature of the basement immediately south of the \n 2 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nFalkland Escarpment comes from seismic imaging of tilted fault blocks in this region \n(Lorenzo & Mutter 1988; Barker 1999) and from the fact that a well-defined magnetic \nanomaly just to the north of the escarpment is indicative of the contrast between magnetic, \noceanic basement to the north and less magnetic, continental basement to the south \n(Rabinowitz & LaBrecque 1979).  \nThe nature of the basement beneath the central and southern parts of the Falkland Plateau \nBasin has been more open to debate. Ludwig (1983) interpreted the basin to be floored by \noceanic crust, but noted that this was based on a velocity structure defined by only a few \nsonobuoy profiles. No refracted arrivals from the upper mantle were detected, but wide-angle \nreflections on Line 139 were interpreted to indicate that the Moho lies at a depth of 12 km \nbeneath 5-6 km of crystalline crust, with lower crustal and upper mantle velocities of 6.6 \nkm\/s and 7.8 km\/s respectively (Ludwig, 1983). This was supported by a gravity model \npresented by Barker (1999), who observed that the presence of oceanic basement is \ncompatible with, if not directly indicative of, rotation of an independent Falkland Islands \nblock. Isostatic considerations led Lorenzo & Mutter (1988) to conclude that the crust \nbeneath the Falkland Plateau Basin was around 11-12 km thick, and was either thicker-than-\nnormal oceanic crust or stretched continental crust. Barker (1999) identified linear, NE-\ntrending magnetic anomalies about 100 km ESE of the Falkland Islands which he interpreted \nas the expression of seaward-dipping reflectors (SDRs) at a volcanic rifted continental \nmargin. Lorenzo & Mutter (1988) identified possible SDRs on the eastern side of the basin \n(on Line 143 about 100 km south of the intersection with line 139), and also noted volcanic \nedifices which suggest melt generation at the time the basin was formed. \n \nRegional 3D modelling \nMethod \nA 3D model for the structure of the Falkland Plateau region has been constructed using \nmethods described by Kimbell et al. (2004). In outline, this involves building an isostatically \ncompensated model of lithospheric structure, calculating the associated free-air gravity \nanomaly and then modifying the model geometry to improve the fit with the observed gravity \nfield. The primary inputs were: \n(i) The topography of the region (Fig. 1a), based on the grid of Smith & Sandwell (1997); \n(ii) The age of ocean crust (Fig. 1b), based on the grid of M\u0171ller et al. (1997); \n(iii) The free-air gravity anomaly (Fig. 1c) derived from satellite altimetry (Sandwell & Smith \n1997; Version 9.1 used for this study); \n(iv) An initial compilation of sediment thickness (Fig. 2a), based on the sources described \npreviously. \nThe use of a bathymetric model that was itself derived from gravity data requires \njustification. The method of Smith and Sandwell (1997) constrains their model to honour the \ncontrol provided by depth soundings from marine surveys, and the database they employed \nincluded a particularly dense coverage of such soundings in this region. This has resulted in \nbathymetry that is well-constrained, at least at intermediate and longer wavelengths, and \nwhich shows little evidence of line-related noise. Although Smith and Sandwell (1997) \nadapted the gravity-topography transfer function to make allowance for factors such as \nsediment infilling of seafloor topography, there will undoubtedly be inaccuracies in the way \nshorter wavelength gravity variations between the survey lines are partitioned between \nbathymetric and bedrock causes. For this reason, the shortest wavelength features in the \nmodel presented here (which are ascribed to variations in cover sequence thickness) should \n 3 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nbe regarded with caution. The discussion in this paper only addresses features of longer \nwavelength, which are not susceptible to such ambiguity.  \nThe lack of deep wells over much of the region means that there is little direct information on \nthe density of the sedimentary cover rocks. On the basis of stratigraphic inferences (Richards \net al. 1996) and limited density log data from the North Falkland Basin, the shale compaction \ncurve of Sclater & Christie (1980) was used to model the density of the cover sequence, and \npredicted values ranging between 1.66 and 2.70 Mg\/m3 depending on the depth of burial. The \ncrystalline crust (both continental and oceanic) was assumed to have an average density of \n2.85 Mg\/m3, and was split at its mid-point into upper and lower crust with densities of 2.75 \nMg\/m3 and 2.95 Mg\/m3 respectively.  \nA density model for the upper mantle was incorporated which allowed for variations in its \ntemperature. Temperatures in oceanic areas were calculated using a cooling plate model \nassuming the ocean ages shown in Fig. 1b. The cooling half-space model, as employed by \nKimbell et al. (2004), was not considered appropriate because the oceanic lithosphere of the \nArgentine Basin is old enough for its thermal decay to be influenced by the supply of heat at \nthe base of the plate as a result of small-scale convection (Parsons & Sclater 1977; Parsons & \nMcKenzie 1978). A continental geotherm based on a surface heat flow of 60 mW\/m2 was \nassumed elsewhere. This is compatible with the heat flow observed at DSDP Site 511, which \nlies about 11 km south-west of Site 330 on the Falkland Plateau (Langseth & Ludwig 1983). \nTemperatures between the oceanic and continental regimes were ramped across a 100 km \nwide zone centred at the assumed continent-ocean boundary. Two-dimensional thermal \nmodelling suggests that this is a reasonable assumption in areas of younger ocean crust and \nthat thermal contrasts where the ocean crust is older have decayed to such an extent that the \nwidth of this ramp is not critical. In order to simulate the transition from conductive to \nconvective heat transfer at the base of the lithosphere, this transition was approximated by the \n1100\u00baC isotherm (Kimbell et al. 2004), with isothermal conditions maintained between this \nlevel and the base of the model at 125 km. When the effects of temperature and overburden \nstress were combined, the mantle density model predicted values ranging between 3.24 and \n3.33 Mg\/m3. \nThe sedimentary sequence, crystalline crust and upper mantle were assembled in an isostatic \nmodel in which the depth to the crust-mantle boundary was adjusted to equalise the load at a \ncompensation depth of 125 km. This boundary is assumed to be equivalent to the seismic \nMoho in the discussion presented here. An estimate is required for the Moho \u2018reference \ndepth\u2019, which is defined as its depth beneath continental crust which has an upper surface at \nthe topographic datum, no cover rocks, a zero gravity anomaly and mantle temperatures \ndefined by the standard continental geotherm. The reference depth cannot be resolved from \nthe gravity data alone, and was set at 36 km as a result of comparisons with seismic data (see \nbelow).  \nThe gravity field over the complete model was then calculated using wavenumber domain \nroutines (Parker 1972; Dabek & Williamson 1999), and selected model interfaces were \nadjusted, using the method of Oldenburg (1974), to reduce the mismatch between observed \nand calculated anomalies. These routines are based on a flat-earth assumption but the \ndistortion this introduces when compared to a curved-earth model is judged to be within \nacceptable limits (Kimbell et al. 2004). The optimisation was conducted in several stages. \nFirstly, a smoothing filter was applied to remove the shortest wavelengths from the isostatic \nMoho and then its geometry was adjusted to improve the replication of longer wavelength \ngravity anomalies. The thickness of the sedimentary sequence was then adjusted to reduce \nshorter wavelength residual anomalies. The model density structure was modified to allow \n 4 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nfor these geometrical changes and further iterations of the Moho and base sediments \ninterfaces were used for \u2018fine-tuning\u2019. \nResults \nThe thickness of the sedimentary layer in the optimised model is shown in Fig. 2b, and the \nthickness of the crystalline crust and depth to Moho are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b \nrespectively. The calculated gravity field over the model (Figs. 4a) provides a close match to \nthe observations (Fig. 1c). The largest residual anomalies occur across the southern edge of \nthe Falkland Plateau (Fig. 4b), although even here they generally amount to less than about \n10% of the observed anomaly variation. A measure of how much the model has departed \nfrom local isostatic equilibrium is provided by the load anomaly calculated at the original \ncompensation depth (Fig. 5). \nThere are several sources of uncertainty in this modelling that need to be taken into account \nwhen assessing the results (Kimbell et al. 2004). The final model geometry is strongly \ninfluenced by the initial assumptions about sediment thickness and the details of the \noptimisation sequence. Because the Moho was optimised initially and was allowed to respond \nto gravity effects with wavelengths down to about 100 km, it is inevitable that the optimised \nmodel for the sedimentary sequence (Fig. 2b) will have a similar overall form to the starting \nmodel (Fig. 2a). The consequence of this is that inaccuracies in the longer wavelength \ncomponents of the initial sedimentary model will propagate into the final version. There is \nevidence of instability in the optimisation process on the southern margin of the Falkland \nPlateau, particularly between 45\u00baW and 50\u00baW, where a zone of very thin crystalline crust \n(Fig. 3) appears to be an artefact which is compensated by an unlikely subsidiary thickening \nof the sedimentary section. This arises because of inaccuracy in partitioning the \naccommodation of residual gravity anomalies between the base sediment and Moho \ninterfaces. \nA major assumption is that the average density of the crystalline crust is constant throughout \nthe area. Departures from this assumption (e.g. because of igneous intrusions) are effectively \nabsorbed in variations in the thickness of the crystalline crust and the sedimentary layer. The \nadoption of the same value (2.85 Mg\/m3) for crystalline continental and oceanic crust \nreceives some support from the average oceanic density estimate of 2.86 Mg\/m3 by Carlson \nand Herrick (1990). The oceanic crust may have a higher average density, however, \nparticularly where layer 3 is thickened as a result of enhanced oceanic crustal production \n(White & McKenzie 1989; Mutter & Mutter 1993). \nAnother source of uncertainty is in upper mantle density variations due, for example, to \ndifferent degrees of mantle depletion or to thermal contrasts not simulated in the simple \ntemperature model adopted. There may also be deeper-seated mantle effects that introduce \nvery long wavelength variations in the gravity field that are not properly accounted for. \nAnalysis of the modelling results \nComparison with deep seismic data \nA section across the 3D model along line 144 (Fig. 6) illustrates the predicted variations in \ncrustal thickness from north to south across the Falkland Plateau. The Moho lies at a similar \ndepth (about 12 km) beneath the Argentine Basin to the north and the Scotia Sea to the south, \nbut the latter has thicker crystalline crust. Beneath the plateau, the Moho depth decreases \nfrom 25-30 km beneath the Falkland Escarpment and Burdwood Bank to around 20 km \nbeneath the Falkland Plateau Basin. The Moho was not detected seismically on this line, but \nthe interpretation of Ludwig (1983) does include a relatively high crustal velocity of 7.1 km\/s \n 5 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nat shallow depth from a single sounding at about 650 km. The modelled sedimentary \nthickness is in reasonable agreement with the seismic refraction interpretation of Ludwig \n(1983).  \nAn east-west section through the model along line 139 (Fig. 7) indicates that the Moho lies at \na depth of more than 30 km beneath the Falkland Platform, about 20 km beneath the Falkland \nPlateau Basin, and about 25 km beneath Maurice Ewing Bank. There is a major difference \nbetween this interpretation and previous identification of the seismic Moho at a depth of 12 \nkm beneath the basin (Fig. 7; Ludwig 1983). Barker (1999) generated a 2D gravity model \nwhich was much closer to the seismic interpretation, and achieved this by assuming a much \nshallower (c. 24 km) Moho beneath the Falkland Platform. The key difference between our \ngravity model and that of Barker (1999) thus appears to be the reference depth assumed for \nthe Moho. \nComparison of the model Moho with a range of published seismic interpretations (Fig. 8) \nillustrates a good match with the seismic evidence at sites in the Argentine Basin and Scotia \nSea, but there are discrepancies elsewhere (labelled a-e in Figs. 3 and 8). In addition to the \nmismatch discussed above (\u2018a\u2019 in Figs. 3 and 8), the model Moho is substantially deeper than \nthe seismic Moho at locations b-d near South Georgia (Ewing et al. 1971) and also just south \nof the Falkland Islands (e in Figs. 3 and 8; Ludwig et al. 1968). There is no systematic \nrelationship between the average crustal velocity and the degree of mismatch in these \ncomparisons, so it appears unlikely that the discrepancies are due to lateral crustal density \nvariations not accounted for in the modelling. Some of the seismic Moho depths are open to \ndoubt, because of limitations in the data from these early surveys. For example, the two \ndeterminations by Ludwig et al. (1968) lie at either end of the same traverse and are \ndescribed by the authors as very tentative, as they are based on only a few Moho arrivals; the \nmatch with the 3D model is good in one case and poor in the other (e in Figs. 3 and 8). \nMismatch b, to the north-west of South Georgia, also lies adjacent to a Moho determination \nthat is similar to the modelled depth (Ewing et al. 1971). \nIt is possible that some of the mismatches arise because the seismic interface used in the \ncomparison lies within, rather than at the base of, the crust. For example, the interpreted \nupper-mantle velocity of 7.5-7.6 km\/s at sites c and d (Figs. 3 and 8) south-west of South \nGeorgia (Ewing et al. 1971) could be indicative of high-velocity lower crust rather than upper \nmantle.  \nInsights into lithospheric strength \nThe load anomalies derived from the 3D model (Figs. 5, 6 and 7) provide insights into the \nstrength and flexure of the lithosphere, in particular across the southern margin of the \nFalkland Plateau. The pattern here is characterised by a load anomaly high extending from \nBurdwood Bank along the North Scotia Ridge to South Georgia and a parallel low which \ncoincides with the Falkland Trough. These features can be correlated with the thrusting of the \nScotia Plate across the southern edge of the South American Plate. The overthrust Burdwood \nBank and the North Scotia Ridge are supported at a relatively high level, generating a \npositive anomaly, while the southern edge of the Falkland Plateau is flexed downwards, \ngenerating a negative anomaly. This high-low pattern is well resolved in the load anomaly \nprofile along line 144 (Fig. 6), with a particularly clear signature of downward flexure \nbetween 600 km and 740 km. \nIt is possible to estimate the strength of the lithosphere from its deflection under load by \nreference to an elastic plate model (Sandwell & Schubert 1992; Watts 2001; Bry et al. 2004). \nIn Fig. 9, three profiles across the southern part of the Falkland Plateau are compared with a \n 6 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nseries of theoretical curves for plates with different effective elastic thicknesses (Te). It has \nbeen assumed that the medium above the plate is seawater (density 1.03 Mg\/m3) and the \nmedium below is mantle (density 3.3 Mg\/m3), and the flexure has been displayed as load \nanomalies. Two end-members are illustrated in each case \u2013 one in which a load is applied to \nthe end of a broken plate and the other in which it is applied to a continuous plate. Between \nthese are a range of solutions representing different degrees of mechanical coupling. These \nprofiles provide evidence of lateral changes in the strength of the lithosphere (Figs. 5 and 9). \nAn elastic thickness of about 5 km is estimated on profile I, which crosses the South Falkland \nBasin north of Burdwood Bank. Stronger lithosphere, with an elastic thickness of 15-20 km, \nis indicated on line II across the south-western part of the Falkland Plateau Basin, while a \nprofile south of the DSDP site on Maurice Ewing Bank indicates a value of around 10 km. \nThese results agree with those of Bry et al. (2004), who estimated elastic thicknesses in the \nrange 5-20 km from inverse modelling of gravity and bathymetric profiles and also identified \nthe eastward increase in the strength in the South Falkland Basin. This change in strength can \nbe seen qualitatively in variations in the width of the load anomaly low along the southern \nside of the Falkland Plateau (Fig. 5). \nA north-east-trending load anomaly high which coincides with the gravity high about 100 km \neast-south-east of the Falkland Islands can be correlated with an area of thick sediment \naccumulation (Figs. 5, 1b and 2). This suggests that the anomaly may arise, at least in part, \nbecause the sediments are supported at a relatively high level by the strength of the \nlithosphere. There is also evidence of positive load anomalies associated with the North \nFalkland Basin and the thick sediments accumulated on the Argentinian margin further to the \nnorth. \nThe northern flank of the Falkland Plateau is characterised by load anomalies that are \ngenerally positive to the north of the Falkland Escarpment and negative to the south. The \ngradient zone between the positive and negative components correlates closely with the \ncontinent-ocean boundary defined by other methods (e.g. the magnetic edge anomaly of \nRabinowitz & LaBrecque (1979)). A likely explanation for this pattern is that, as the oceanic \nlithosphere to the north has cooled and subsided, mechanical coupling with the continental \nlithosphere to the south has led to the former being held at a relatively high level and the \nlatter being depressed (Lorenzo & Wessel 1997). This effect is more difficult to model \nquantitatively than on the southern margin of the plateau, perhaps because a variety of other \nfactors have influenced the flexural behaviour of this margin over a longer timespan. These \ninclude flexural uplift resulting from unloading due to erosion (Basile & Allemand 2002) \nand\/or a component of extension along oceanward dipping faults (Clift & Lorenzo 1999). \nTransient thermal uplift will have occurred as the oceanic ridge migrated along the transform \nmargin and there may also have been permanent uplift if any igneous underplating occurred. \nVariations in sediment loading will also contribute to the flexural response of this margin. It \nalso needs to be recognised that inaccuracies in the model will distort the load anomaly \npattern: if a particular gravity feature is accommodated by topography on a density interface \nat an incorrect depth, its load contribution will be distorted. \nDiscussion \nThe 3D modelling suggests that the crystalline crust beneath the Falkland Plateau Basin is \nmore than twice as thick (13\u201315 km compared with 5\u20136 km) than has previously been \ninferred from limited deep data provided by a seismic experiment (Ludwig 1983). The \ndifference would be reduced if the crust beneath the basin has a lower average density than \nthe oceanic crust to the north and south, but the measured seismic velocities are similar so \nthis is considered unlikely. Even if a density difference of 0.1 Mg\/m3 is introduced, it only \n 7 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \naccounts for about 2 km of the discrepancy. The Moho could be maintained at a relatively \nshallow level if the underlying mantle has an anomalously low density, either because of a \nthermal anomaly or a compositional effect. The thermal anomaly associated with the \nformation of the basin will, however, have largely decayed since extension ceased in the Late \nJurassic or Early Cretaceous, and thinning of the continental crust beneath the basin will have \nreduced the heat generated by the radiogenic elements it contains. If depleted continental \nlithospheric mantle underlies the basin, its density may be lower than that of the mantle \nbeneath the oceanic regions to the north and south, although the effect is more marked for \nArchaean lithosphere than for the Proterozoic lithosphere that is probable in this area \n(Poudjom Djomani et al. 2001). The density of the upper mantle could have been reduced by \npartial serpentinisation if extreme extension allowed the ingress of seawater to upper mantle \nlevels, as has been suggested in the case of the Rockall Basin to the west of Ireland (O\u2019Reilly \net al. 1996). Relatively low temperatures are, however, required for the lower crust to deform \nin a brittle fashion and for a sufficient thickness of the upper mantle to lie within the stability \nfield for serpentinite (P\u00e9rez-Gussiny\u00e9 et al. 2001).  \nAn alternative explanation is that the deepest layer detected by the previous seismic \nexperiment was a zone of igneous underplating rather than the upper mantle. Zones at the \nbase of the crust with high seismic velocities (\u2265 7.2 km\/s) are often detected at volcanic \ncontinental margins, and have been interpreted to be due to underplating by basic igneous \nrocks formed during rifting when mantle temperatures are higher than normal (White & \nMcKenzie 1989). This process is not confined to continental margins, and can affect \nintracontinental areas, with the thickness of the underplated zone depending on a combination \nof the amount and duration of extension and the mantle temperature (Bown & White 1995). \nReconstructions indicate that the Falkland Plateau region lay at the edge of the major Karoo-\nFerrar magmatic province in the Early \u2013 Middle Jurassic (e.g. Macdonald et al. 2003), so the \nconditions may well have been favourable for underplating. It is this consideration that makes \nthe hypothesis more likely than one involving serpentinisation of the upper mantle. Karoo age \nigneous activity in the region is demonstrated by the dykes of this age exposed on the \nFalkland Islands (Mussett & Taylor 1994). Where underplating is present, the average crustal \ndensity will be higher than normal so the crustal thickness indicated by the 3D model may be \nan underestimate, although the effect may be offset to some extent by reduction in the density \nof the underlying mantle as a result of melt extraction (Kimbell et al. 2004). As suggested by \nStorey et al. (1999), the lithospheric weakening associated with this thermal event may have \nfacilitated the formation and rotation of a Falkland Islands microplate during Gondwana \nbreakup. \nThe Falkland Plateau probably lay adjacent to the Weddell Sea embayment (Filchner Block) \nbefore Antarctica split from Gondwana (Livermore & Hunter 1996; Jokat et al. 2003), so it is \ninstructive to look for parallels between the two regions. King (2000) produced a crustal \nprofile extending across the Weddell Sea embayment from the Antarctic Peninsular to Coats \nLand merging the results of Kudryavtzev et al. (1987), H\u0171bscher (1994), and H\u0171bscher et al. \n(1996a 1998). This shows a deep sedimentary basin (10-12 km of sediments) overlying an \napproximately 20 km thick, three-layer crust with upper-, middle- and lower-crustal \nvelocities of 5.4\u20135.7 km\/s, 6.5-6.6 km\/s and 7.1-7.5 km\/s respectively. H\u0171bscher et al. \n(1996a,b) and King (2000) interpreted these velocities to be indicative of extended and \nunderplated continental crust. The velocity structure is similar to that beneath the Falkland \nPlateau Basin, providing the possibility of a high velocity lower crust beneath the latter is \naccepted. King (2000) drew parallels between the extension of the Filchner Block and that in \nthe Falkland Plateau Basin and inferred that this occurred between 184 and 175 Ma (Early \u2013 \nMid Jurassic). \n 8 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nIn addition to the linear north-east-trending magnetic anomalies at the western margin of the \nFalkland Plateau Basin, the magnetic mapping of Barker (1999; his fig. 5) reveals longer \nwavelength (50 \u2013 100 km) magnetic anomalies extending across the basin. There is evidence \nof further anomalies to the east and north-east of the area shown by Barker (1999) in \nmagnetic data from the GEODAS marine trackline database (National Geophysical Data \nCenter 2004), although the coverage is sparse. The scale of the anomalies indicates \nsubstantial crustal magnetisation variations, and possible sources are structures within a \nMesoproterozoic basement and igneous bodies associated with later magmatism. Basement \nmagnetic sources in southern Africa (in particular the source of the Beattie Anomaly; Harvey \net al. 2001) and Antarctica may have originally been linked through the Falkland Plateau \nregion (Jokat et al. 2003). The location of the region in relation to the Karoo-Ferrar province \nsuggests the likelihood of later igneous activity, and this was the explanation favoured by \nFerris et al. (2000) for the magnetic anomalies with similar wavelengths and amplitudes that \ncharacterise the Filchner Block (see also Golynsky et al. 2002). The northernmost of those \nanomalies form a belt comprising the Explora, Andenes and Orion anomalies which may \nrepresent the signatures of a volcanic margin at the edge of the Filchner Block. The Explorer \nand Andenes anomalies can be correlated with seaward-dipping reflectors (SDRs) \n(Kristofferson & Hinz 1991; Ferris et al. 2000). \nIt is not clear from the magnetic evidence whether fully oceanic basement underlies the \nFalkland Plateau Basin. Such basement could have been generated as a result of the rotation \nand translation of a Falkland Islands microplate in Early-Middle Jurassic times, or \nsubsequently, as a result of the separation of the Falkland Plateau from Antarctica (Barker \n1999). However, the interpretation of linear, NE-trending magnetic anomalies on the western \nbasin margin as SDRs by Barker (1999) is not corroborated by recent commercial seismic \nreflection surveys, and the apparent SDRs identified further east by Lorenzo and Mutter \n(1988) do not coincide with a local magnetic anomaly. Even if it exists beneath the southern \npart of the basin, oceanic crust is unlikely to extend to the northern Falkland Plateau, as \ncontinental basement is indicated there by tilted fault blocks and gneissic rocks in dredge \nhauls (Lorenzo & Mutter 1988), and by a consistent continent-ocean magnetic anomaly just \nto the north of the plateau (Rabinowitz & LaBrecque 1979), at a location which coincides \nwith that predicted by load anomalies calculated from the present modelling (Fig. 5). \nA lateral change in the properties of the Falkland Plateau is indicated by the way it has \nresponded to the load placed on its southern side by the overriding Scotia Plate. The flexural \nmodelling demonstrates an increase in lithospheric strength eastward from the South Falkland \nBasin, south of the Falkland Islands, into the south-western part of the Falkland Plateau \nBasin. Bry et al. (2004) correlated this change with a decrease in the density and penetration \nof normal faulting. The lithosphere becomes weaker again further to the east, on the south \nside of Maurice Ewing Bank. Corroborating evidence for the strength of the lithosphere in the \nsouthern Falkland Plateau Basin is provided by the positive gravity and load anomalies \nassociated with sediment loading at its western margin (Figs. 1b and 5). The strength of the \nlithosphere is affected by the composition and proportions of the mechanically competent \ncrust and upper mantle, and the degree of coupling between these (Burov & Diament 1995). \nYield strength increases with decreasing quartz content, so the continental crust is generally \nweaker than oceanic crust or lithospheric mantle. Ductile flow occurs at lower temperatures \nin relatively quartz-rich crustal rocks than in mantle rocks and, where the crust is sufficiently \nthick, the lithosphere may be weakened by decoupling of the upper crust from the upper \nmantle by a lower crustal ductile layer (the \u2018jelly sandwich\u2019 model). Where the continental \ncrust is thinned, the lithosphere can be strengthened because of the decrease in the relatively \nweak, quartz-rich component and because the temperature in the lower crust may be reduced \n 9 \nKimbell and Richards  3D model of the Falkland Plateau \nto the point where it no longer behaves in a ductile fashion and crust and upper mantle are \ncoupled (Burov & Diament 1995; Brown & Phillips 2000). If underplating is present, it will \ncontribute to this strength because of its relatively low quartz content. The increased strength \nof the lithosphere beneath the southern part of the Falkland Plateau Basin may thus be \nexplained either by it being oceanic in origin (as suggested by Barker 1999) or by thinning \nand underplating of continental crust. Doubt has been cast on the \u2018jelly sandwich\u2019 model for \ncontinental rheology, because of diminishing evidence for earthquakes generated at upper \nmantle depths (Jackson, 2002). The implication is that the strength of continental lithospheric \nmay reside solely in the seismogenic crustal layer. The estimated elastic thicknesses to the \nsouth of the Falkland Islands and Maurice Ewing Bank are less than the modelled thickness \nof crystalline crust at these locations, in conformity with this prediction, but the same does \nnot apply beneath the southern Falkland Plateau Basin (Te = 15 \u2013 20 km; thickness of \ncrystalline crust = 15 km), confirming its anomalous nature.  \nConclusions \nA 3D model for the lithospheric structure of the Falkland Plateau region has been \nconstructed, incorporating thermal and isostatic effects and existing sedimentary thickness \ndata, and refining the model geometries by inversion of gravity anomalies. Such modelling \nprovides relative rather than absolute measures of crustal thickness and is thus dependent on \nthe control provided by available deep seismic survey data, which in this region are of an \nearly vintage. A model which provides the best fit with the majority of seismic experiments \nindicates a substantially greater crustal thickness beneath the Falkland Plateau Basin than \nsuggested by a seismic estimate at this locality, which was based on very limited data \n(Ludwig 1983). The difference could be due to relatively low density upper mantle beneath \nthe basin or to the presence of high-velocity lower crust which was not penetrated by the \nseismic experiment. The latter explanation is preferred, and is compatible with underplating \nformed as the result of the development of the basin within the influence of the Karoo-Ferrar \nplume. Departures from local isostasy in the 3D model provide insights into flexural effects \nwhich can be used to investigate the strength of the lithosphere. Variations in the flexural \nresponse to loading by the Scotia Plate indicate that the lithosphere beneath the southern part \nof the Falkland Plateau Basin is stronger than that to the east and west, either because it is \noceanic or because of strengthening as a result of extension and underplating of continental \ncrust. The thicker crust to the north of the Falkland Plateau Basin is inferred to be continental, \nhowever, with coincident flexural and magnetic anomalies defining the position of the \nboundary between this and the oceanic basement of the Argentine Basin further north.  \n \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Falkland Islands Government and the Executive Director of \nthe British Geological Survey (NERC). \n \nReferences \nBarker, P.F. 1999.

(a) Bathymetric map of the Falkland Plateau region based on data from Smith and \nSandwell (1997). (b) Age of ocean crust based on data from M\u00fcller et al. (1997). There are \nalternative interpretations for the location of the continent-ocean boundary on the west side of \nthe Argentine Basin (e.g. Max et al., 1999), although this has little impact on the modelling \ndiscussed here. (c) Free-air gravity anomalies derived from satellite altimetry (Sandwell & \nSmith, 1997). The image employs an equal-area colour scale and illumination from the north. \nFig. 2. (a) Initial sediment thickness estimate based on a variety of sources (see text). (b) \nsediment thickness in the optimised 3D model. Contours are at 1 km intervals in both maps. \nFig. 3. (a) Thickness of crystalline crust in the optimised 3D model (contours at 5 km \nintervals) (b) depth to Moho in the optimised 3D model (contours at 2 km intervals). Symbols \nindicate locations where a possible Moho has been identified in seismic experiments; selected \nlocations are labelled (a-e) for cross-reference with Fig. 8 and discussion in the text. \nFig. 4. (a) Calculated free-air gravity anomalies over the optimised 3D model. Imaging \nparameters are identical to those used for the observed field shown in Fig. 1c. (b) Residual \nfree-air gravity anomalies over the optimised model. \nFig. 5. Load anomalies predicted by the 3D optimised model (departures from the reference \nvalue at the base of the model at 125 km). Contours are at 10 MPa intervals. Green lines \nshow locations of profiles I-III in Fig. 9. \nFig. 6. Section through the 3D model along airgun-sonobuoy profile 144 compared with the \nseismic interpretation by Ludwig (1983). For line location see Fig. 1a. \nFig. 7. Section through the 3D model along airgun-sonobuoy profile 139 compared with the \nseismic interpretation by Ludwig (1983). For line location see Fig. 1a. \nFig. 8. Comparison of depth to Moho in the 3D model with available seismic interpretation. \nLocations shown in Figs. 3a and 3b; the largest departures are labelled (a-e) to aid \ncomparison with these figures. \nFig. 9. Load anomaly profiles from the southern edge of the Falkland Plateau compared with \ntheoretical curves for broken and continuous flexed plates with different effective elastic \nthicknesses (Te). Profile locations are shown in Fig. 5. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\nkm\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nkm\nLoad anomaly\nFree-air gravity anomaly\nObserved\nCalculated\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n5.0 - 5.3\n5.8\n6.7\n5.7\n6.3\n7.1\nSeabed\nBase sediments\nMid-crust (mid-point)\nMoho\nInterfaces from 3D model:\nmPa\nmGal\nFalkland EscarpmentArgentine Basin Falkland Plateau Basin Scotia SeaBurdwood Bank\n6.0\nLine 144\nInterfaces from seismic interpretation\nof Ludwig (1983), with velocities in km\/s\nNE SW\nKimbell and Richards 3D model of the Falkland Plateau\nFig. 6\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n5.3\n7.8\n5.7\n6.6 7.4\n5.6\n6.7\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nkm\nmPa\nmGal\nkm\nLoad anomaly\nFree-air gravity anomaly Observed\nCalculated\nFalkland Platform Falkland Plateau Basin Maurice Ewing Bank Georgia Basin\nInterfaces from seismic interpretation\nof Ludwig (1983), with velocities in km\/s\nDSDP\n330\nW E\nSeabed\nBase sediments\nMid-crust (mid-point)\nMoho\nInterfaces from 3D model:\nKimbell and Richards 3D model of the Falkland Plateau\nFig. 7\n05\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nEwing et al.
