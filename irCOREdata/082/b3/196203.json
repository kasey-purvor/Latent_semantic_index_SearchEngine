Cultural Intermediaries and the Media. Sociology Compass. 4\/7 (2010): 405-\n416. \n \n \nAbstract: \nThis article provides an introduction to, and makes a case for, cultural intermediaries \nas an entry point for the study of media and cultural production. We offer a strategic \nparsing of the conceptual foundations provided by Bourdieu with regard to cultural \nintermediaries and the media, loosely organized in terms of where they are located \n(working in media); the means of accomplishing their role (working with media); \nand their economic role in promoting consumption (the work of mediation). We then \nfollow the translation of the concept from Bourdieu to a cultural economy approach \nthat is concerned with the material practices involved in the formation of value. A \nreview and comparison of substantive findings from a range of cultural economic \ncase studies of cultural intermediary occupations serves as an introduction to a three-\nfold approach that might guide future studies of occupations in cultural industries, in \nterms of: historicizing occupations, material practices, and assessments of impact. \nFinally, we conclude with a claim for the utility of \u201ecultural intermediaries\u201f as a way \nto think about cultural production, and highlight areas in which work remains to be \ndone. \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nSince the early 1990s, considerable social scientific attention has been directed at the \ncharacter, roles and implications of the service class in the context of contemporary \nconsumer economies (e.g. Lash and Urry 1994; Florida 2002). Against the backdrop \nof expanding higher education, growing service industries marked by feminization \nand precariousness, the globalization of commodity chains concentrating the \nfunctions of design, branding and marketing in developed labour markets, and the \nincreasing centrality of \u201eculture\u201f (images, experiences, ideas) to economies, an \nemergent body of scholarly research explores the significance of cultural producers. \nOne stream within this work revolves around the notion of \u201ecultural intermediaries\u201f: \nproducers of symbolic goods and services, to whom Pierre Bourdieu (1984) ascribes \na significant role in the reproduction of consumer economies.   \n \nDespite the explicit connection in Bourdieu\u201fs original formulation between cultural \nintermediaries and the media, the use of the concept in scholarly research on media \noccupations remains underdeveloped. This article provides an introduction to, and \nmakes a case for, cultural intermediaries as an entry point for the study of media and \ncultural production. Our overview chimes with recent considerations of how the \n 2 \npolitical economic study of cultural production has focused on structures and \norganizational flows of power at the expense of an adequate account of the \ncontested, everyday practices of the agents of cultural production (e.g. Garnham \n2005; Havens et al 2009; cf. Caldwell 2008; Hesmondhalgh 2006). Bourdieu\u201fs \nconcern with the cultural worker is certainly not unique. Sociology of culture and \ncultural studies research has also focused on the practices of cultural producers (for \nuseful reviews of which, see Cook 2006; Havens et al 2009). To a much greater \nextent than Bourdieu (who was primarily working from large-scale survey data), \nsuch research foregrounds issues of agency and negotiation in ethnographic \nexaminations of producers in such fields as television (D\u201fAcci 1994; Havens 2006; \nTinic 2005) and advertising and marketing (Davila 2001; Lotz 2007; Sender 2004). \nTaking up this focus on the cultural worker and extending beyond Bourdieu\u201fs initial \nformulation, while employing an ethnographic sensitivity to lived experience and \nmaterial practices, have been a number of  \u201ecultural economic\u201f (du Gay and Pryke \n2002) examinations of producers in fields such as fashion (e.g. Entwistle 2006), \nadvertising (e.g. Cronin 2004), branding (e.g. Moor 2008), and lifestyle magazines \n(e.g. Gough-Yates 2003).  \n \nThe article proceeds, first, by highlighting the conceptual foundations provided by \nBourdieu. We then map the translation of the concept from Bourdieu to a cultural \neconomy approach. Setting out three fronts on which analyses of cultural \nintermediaries might proceed, we review key findings from a range of cultural \neconomic case studies. Finally, we conclude with a claim for the utility of \u201ecultural \nintermediaries\u201f as a way to think about cultural production, and highlight areas in \nwhich work remains to be done. \n \nBourdieu on Cultural Intermediaries \nThe point of departure for discussions of cultural intermediaries is typically \nBourdieu\u201fs  Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (1984). Drawing \non social survey data and qualitative vignettes from France in the 1960s and early \n1970s, Bourdieu analyses patterns in the consumption practices and preferences of \nsocio-occupational groups. In doing so, he suggests how \u201etaste\u201f is a contested terrain \non which battles for legitimacy and distinction are fought. Of particular interest are \nthe petite bourgeoisie, and especially that fraction he calls the \u201enew\u201f petite \nbourgeoisie (1984: 354-65, passim), of which cultural intermediaries are members \nand exemplars. \n \nBelow, we offer a strategic parsing of Distinction with regard to cultural \nintermediaries and the media, loosely organized in terms of where they are located \n(working in media); the means of accomplishing their role (working with media); \nand their economic role in promoting consumption (the work of mediation). \n \nWorking in media. Cultural intermediaries may be defined, descriptively, by their \noccupations, which are largely located in the cultural industries, including the media. \nBourdieu highlights (1984: 359), as hallmarks of the new petite bourgeoisie, \noccupations involved in: \n 3 \npresentation and representation (sales, marketing, advertising, public relations, \nfashion, decoration and so forth) and in all the institutions providing symbolic \ngoods and services. These include the various jobs in medical and social \nassistance\u2026and in cultural production and organization (\u2026radio and TV \nproducers and presenters, magazine journalists).  \nWithin that large (and internally differentiated) new petite bourgeois fraction, \ncultural intermediaries are most typically \u201ethe producers of cultural programmes on \nTV and radio or the critics of \u201equality\u201f newspapers and magazines and all the writer-\njournalists and journalist-writers\u201f (1984: 325). \n \nAs a working definition, however, such a description has come under criticism. First, \nthe assertion that these are \u201enew\u201f occupations is problematic (Nixon and du Gay \n2002: 497), if only because\u2014despite technological advancements and changes\u2014\nmany of the occupations, their industries and the broader work of promoting \nconsumption have long histories (e.g. McFall 2002, 2004). Second, the narrow \nreduction of cultural intermediaries to critics and commentators has created \nconfusion, because the work of mediating cultural forms applies to a broader range \nof occupations, both within and beyond the petite bourgeoisie (new or otherwise) \n(Hesmondhalgh 2006: 226-7; Nixon and du Gay 2002: 498). \n \nWorking with media. Bourdieu highlights \u201econtrol over the mass media\u201f (1984: 325) \nas a distinguishing characteristic of cultural intermediaries. Here, however, the focus \nis less on media occupations per se, and more on how cultural intermediaries use the \nmedia to accomplish their pedagogical work of shaping consumer tastes, as tools for \nthe dissemination of their cultural wares and middle-brow culture more generally. \nThis has radical potential, as mass media forms make possible the delivery of (a \nversion of) legitimate culture into the private sphere of those normally excluded \n(1984: 33), be it a television presentation of an opera (the thing itself), or a popular \ndiscussion of opera on a television culture programme (words about something, as a \nsubstitution for the thing itself; 1984: 365).  \n \nIt is not only that cultural intermediaries use media to accomplish their promotional \nwork, but that in doing so they are an effect of and contributor to the corporatization \nof the media (cf. Hesmondhalgh 2006) and other cultural industries, which are \nincreasingly intent on market growth, profitability and deference to ratings, audience \ncirculation statistics and so forth. In the search for audiences and consumer markets, \nthe world of mass production increasingly co-opts aspects of legitimate, restricted \nculture in order to lend cachet, legitimacy, value and so forth (Bourdieu 1996). The \nsuccess of such strategies encourages an upward cycle of co-optation and \ncommercialization. The cultural intermediary is the agent and mass media the \nconduit for the strategic migration and translation of \u201erestricted\u201f culture into the field \nof large-scale production (Bourdieu 1984: 583; 1996).  \n \nClaims about the pedagogical work of cultural intermediaries are couched, more \ngenerally, in Bourdieu\u201fs view of the media as an indirect cultural mechanism for the \nreproduction of the social order. The media and its producers contribute to a \u201ediffuse \n 4 \neducation\u201f (Bourdieu and Passeron 1977) that shapes tastes and dispositions. Hence, \nBourdieu is concerned with the role of cultural intermediaries in shaping tastes for \nnot only particular cultural goods, but also for particular ways of life. \n \nThe work of mediation. Beyond describing their location in cultural industries and \ntheir work in media production, however, Bourdieu offers a more useful, conceptual \ndefinition of cultural intermediaries as those involved in mediating between the \nproduction of cultural goods and the production of consumer tastes (1984: 230). For \nexample, critics and commentators write, talk and present about cultural forms as a \nway to popularize them, assisting in the \u201eobjective orchestration\u2026of the fields of \nproduction and that of the field of consumption\u201f (1984: 230; see also 232, passim). \nIn this, petite bourgeois cultural intermediaries are closely aligned with their \nbourgeois counterparts (\u201ethe directors and executives of firms in tourism and \njournalism, publishing and the cinema, fashion and advertising, decoration and \nproperty development\u201f; 1984: 310-11), whose lead they follow. If the bourgeois \ncultural intermediaries are the vanguard taste makers, then the petite bourgeois \ncultural intermediaries are responsible for selling those tastes as widely as possible. \n(However, recent work on cultural intermediaries has largely lost sight of the \ndynamics between the established and new fractions of cultural intermediaries.) \n \nThus, cultural intermediaries are defined by their role in mediating between \nproduction and consumption. They have a broadly pedagogic function, shaping the \nperceptions and preferences of consumers in order to mobilize their actions along \ndesired routes. In this, they effect a \u201esymbolic imposition\u201f (1984: 362), framing \nparticular cultural products as legitimate and, thus, as valuable. They contribute to \nthe \u201eproduction of the value of the work or, what amounts to the same thing, of the \nbelief in the value of the work\u201f (Bourdieu 1996: 229). In short, they add value. \n \nForms of legitimate culture do not require cultural intermediary interventions; their \ncultural value is already assured through established hierarchies and authorities. \nRather, cultural intermediaries work within the sphere of the legitimisable (Bourdieu \net al 1990) to canonize the \u201enot-yet-legitimate\u201f (1984: 326) (and thus not (yet) \nmonopolized by the dominant class). They do this via the mobilization of both \nestablished, legitimate culture and the forms of media at their disposal. By \nsurrounding the not-yet-legitimate with the established signs of authority and \ncredibility, cultural intermediaries help to frame certain choices as more desirable. In \ndoing so, they do not divulge legitimate culture (which is ultimately impossible; \n1984: 326), but rather expand the content of middle-brow culture by popularizing \n(and thus, for Bourdieu, rendering mediocre) legitimate culture.  \n \nThe work of mediation is bound up with the subjective dispositions of cultural \nintermediaries, in whom Bourdieu detects a particular harmony between the personal \nand the occupational (1984: 240, 365). This harmony manifests in the peculiar \nresource of sincerity, in that cultural intermediaries offer themselves as \u201erole models \nand guarantors\u201f (1984: 365)\u2014and this is facilitated because they are of the class of \nconsumer to whom they direct their work. That is, cultural intermediaries are both \n 5 \ncultural producers and their own ideal consumers. As such, Bourdieu regards the \nnew petite bourgeoisie as ideal \u201eneeds merchants\u201f, both in that they are convincing \n(they \u201esell so well because they believe in what they sell\u201f; 1984: 365) and that they \nare always selling\u2014beyond a specific good or service\u2014an entire lifestyle or \u201eart of \nliving\u201f (1984: 366). In a speculative discussion, Bourdieu suggests cultural \nintermediaries\u2014and the new petite bourgeoisie generally\u2014are the \u201etransmission \nbelt\u201f for the ethical retooling of the new economy, embodying and promoting an \nethos of fun and pleasure in order to produce the need for their product and, by \nextension, themselves (1984: 359, 365). \n \nIn summary, there are several points of intersection between cultural intermediaries \nand the media, in terms of: occupations located in the media industries; producers of \nmedia content with a particular pedagogical mission; mediators of taste and \nbillboards for a prescribed lifestyle. Moving forward from Bourdieu, we find that the \nfocus on media occupations per se has been superseded by the more inclusive notion \nof those mediating between production and consumption (Negus 2002), and that a \nhost of cultural economic case studies call attention to the diverse strategies and \ndevices (of which mass media is but one) employed in the promotion of \nconsumption. \n \nFrom Bourdieu to Cultural Economy \n \nBourdieu\u201fs discussion of cultural intermediaries and the new petite bourgeoisie rests \nupon the assumed emergence of a \u201enew economy\u2026whose functioning depends as \nmuch on the production of needs and consumers as on the production of goods\u201f \n(1984: 310). Such an economy is intimately concerned with the coordination of \nsupply and demand, and thus with the work of those\u2014like cultural intermediaries\u2014\nwho are charged with knowing, shaping and directing consumer needs and desires. \nMore broadly, much scholarly attention has been directed at the perceived shift in \nthe West over the 20\nth\n century from production- to consumption-oriented societies, \nin which identity and status are regarded less as expressions of one\u201fs work role and \nmore as outcomes of one\u201fs consuming habits. Such arguments are often attended by \nthe suggestion that culture and economy\u2014typically considered as normatively \ndistinct spheres of activity\u2014are increasingly blurred in contemporary society, as \nculture (in the form of images, information, services, signs) becomes more central to \nthe economy, and the economic logic of instrumentality and accumulation comes to \npervade cultural, symbolic life (e.g. Featherstone 1991; Lash and Urry 1994).  \n \nHowever, claims that cultural intermediaries are part of a radically new organization \nof economic and cultural life have been contested (e.g. du Gay 2004; McFall 2004). \nDrawing from the anthropology of science and techniques (AST), actor-network \ntheory (ANT) and Foucault\u201fs work on governmentality (McFall 2004: 63, 82-3), a \ncultural economy approach rejects the position that there has been a fundamental \nbreak with the past, out of which has emerged a \u201enew\u201f hybridization of culture and \neconomy. Rather, a cultural economy perspective is concerned with \u201ethe ways in \nwhich objects and persons are constituted through the discourses and techniques \n 6 \nused to describe them and to act upon them\u201f (du Gay 2004: 100). Cultural economic \nanalyses displace the question of the blurring or hybridization of culture and \neconomy with the question of how culture and economy are mutually produced \nthrough material practices.  \n \nAmin and Thrift (2004: xviii) offer an overarching definition of cultural economy as \n\u201ebeing concerned with the processes of social and cultural relations that go to make \nup what we conventionally term the economic.\u201f They trace a development from a \ngeneral cultural turn in which culture was \u201eadded to\u201f political economic analyses, to \nincreasingly nuanced understandings of how \u201eculture\u201f and \u201eeconomy\u201f are mutually \nimplicated and produced. To escape the reifying effects of using the very categories \nof \u201eeconomy\u201f and \u201eculture,\u201f Amin and Thrift (2004: xiv-xv) map out cultural \neconomy as an \u201eanalysis of the steps through which economic quantities and \nqualities are formed. \u2026[I]t is an attempt to identify the varied impulses and \narticulations through which value is formed, added, and circulated.\u201f Building on \nBourdieu\u201fs concern with how cultural intermediaries are implicated in the \nproduction of \u201ethe belief in the value of the work\u201f (1996: 229), cultural economy \nresearch is thus concerned with the creation of value. Hence, the interest in cultural \nintermediaries, who perform the \u201erelational work\u201f (Cochoy 2003 in du Gay 2004: \n100) between production and consumption, economy and culture. To return to points \nof intersection between cultural intermediaries and the media, the issue is not \nwhether cultural intermediaries are located in the media and\/or work with media, but \nhow they accomplish the \u201equalification of products\u201f (Callon et al 2002: 196) through \nparticular, material practices. \n \nGiven its emphasis on the interconnections of culture and economy in practice, \ncultural economic analyses engage in specific, contextual studies of practices and \ntechniques that constitute the promotion of consumption: \u201ethe ways in which \ndifferent sorts of consumer conducts are mobilised, motivated and distributed \nthrough specific commercial actions and devices\u201f (du Gay 2004: 100; see also Miller \nand Rose 1997). Of interest are the social, technical and performative skills, as well \nas subjective dispositions, called upon by cultural intermediaries in the course of \nidentifying and inscribing notions and perceptions of quality along the commodity \nchains of cultural goods and services, from product design (du Gay et al 1997: 62) to \ncustomer service interactions (Pettinger 2004). As such, this work is concerned with \nday-to-day practices, types of knowledge, attitudes and agendas, and thus employs \ninterviews, field observation and other ethnographic methods, as well as archival \nand historical research, to explore cultural intermediaries\u201f lived experiences and \nroles in economic and cultural life (Nixon and du Gay 2002: 498). \n \nHaving set out the broad, theoretical concerns and methodological approaches, we \nnow turn to an overview of some of the substantive findings from cultural economic \nanalyses of cultural intermediary occupations. This research has spanned such fields \nas advertising (Cronin 2004; McFall 2004; Nixon 2003; Soar, 2000); magazine \npublishing (Crewe 2003; Gough-Yates 2003); book retailing (Wright 2005); fashion \ndesign and retail (Entwistle 2006; Pettinger 2004; Skov 2002); and physical fitness \n 7 \n(Smith Maguire 2008). Below, we use Moor\u201fs (2008) examination of branding \nconsultants as an exemplar of such research, the discussion of which permits both a \nconsideration of related case study findings, and an introduction to a three-fold \napproach that might guide future studies of occupations in cultural industries. \nFollowing Nixon and du Gay (2002), Moor examines branding consultants on three \nfronts, each building from Bourdieu\u201fs (1984) initial formulation, in terms of: \nhistoricizing occupations, material practices, and assessments of impact.  \n \nHistoricizing occupations. The first front on which to consider cultural \nintermediaries is historical, as the basis on which to assess both the claim of \n\u201enewness\u201f for cultural intermediaries (and, by extension, the new petite bourgeoisie), \nand the specific, historical context for their emergence and development. Strictly \nspeaking, cultural intermediary work is not new; it is a manifestation and extension \nof middle class work more generally: work that intervenes between production and \nconsumption. While there has been an increase in Western societies since the 1960s \nin the scales of occupations involving information, images and knowledge, these \noccupations are not necessarily new, nor are they uniformly expanding in number \n(Nixon and du Gay 2002: 497). In the case of branding consulting, Moor (2008) \ntraces the emergence of the occupation in the US and UK to the late 1980s, within \nthe field of industrial design, which can be traced back to the 1930s. More broadly, \nMoor connects the occupation\u201fs development with the intensification of attention to \ndesign, aesthetics and taste in the reproduction of late capitalist economies since the \nmid-20\nth\n century.  \n \nAttention to the development and professionalization of cultural intermediary \noccupations brings to light the ways in which the content of an occupation becomes \ncodified and routinized. Considering branding, for example, the formalization of \nprinciples for connecting brand values to particular colours or materials\u2014what is \nknown as \u201eproduct semantics\u201f\u2014can be traced to the 1980s (Julier 2000 in Moor \n2008: 419). Similarly, Moeran (1996: 60) refers to the \u201esystem of conventions\u201f \nthrough which advertising creatives in Japanese advertising agencies make sense of \nand coordinate with other advertising sub-groups, such as account managers; and \nSmith Maguire\u201fs (2008) examination of personal trainers highlights occupational \nconventions, such as a vocational attitude, that are endorsed through specialized \npractitioner publications. These insights are significant in that they counter claims \nabout radically new forms of work in post-Fordist economies with empirical insight \ninto the sort of deeply-entrenched normative conventions and occupational \n\u201eformulae\u201f (Negus, 2002: 510) and \u201ehabitii\u201f (McFall 2004: 73) that structure (but do \nnot determine) cultural intermediaries\u201f work. \n \nWhile the emergence of branding consultants may coincide with the mid-20\nth\n \ncentury, other case studies bring to light longer-term timelines. McFall (2002), for \nexample, looks back to the start of the 19\nth\n century to trace the emergence of \nadvertising agents and their early links to artistic and literary circles, and notes that \ntheir occupation status and skills were increasingly formalized even by the early 20\nth\n \ncentury. This variation in historical development underlines the need to treat cultural \n 8 \nintermediation as an internally differentiated category: there is no one developmental \ntrajectory for these occupations. Sensitivity is required to assess the lines of \ncontinuity and discontinuity across cases, in terms of the political, economic and \nsocial factors that contextualize moments of emergence, the pace of expansion or the \nmotivation for the formalization of conventions for different cultural intermediary \noccupations. \n \nMaterial practices. The second front on which to consider cultural intermediaries \nconcerns the material, practical accomplishment of their work. Attention is given to \nthe various and intertwined strategies and attitudes that make up cultural \nintermediaries\u201f objective practices and subjective outlooks\u2014what du Gay (2004: \n100) groups as \u201edevices and dispositions.\u201f Foci for research include, but are not \nlimited to, occupational tools, codes, techniques and criteria, as standardized through \ntraining programmes and in textbooks, and manifest (and modified) in their actual \napplication; and the dispositions, rationalities, motivations and aspirations expressed \nby cultural intermediaries and codified in their training programmes. On such a basis \n(as with the historicizing of the occupations), there can then be a grounded \nassessment of the similarities and differences within and across cultural intermediary \noccupations, thereby countering an undifferentiated, bloated notion of cultural \nintermediaries that has troubled some commentators (e.g. Hesmondhalgh 2006). \n \nOn this second front, Moor (2008) draws on interviews with eight London-based \nadvertising, branding and communications professionals to identify several devices \nby which branding consultants accomplish their task of translating abstract values \ninto material form. These tools include design audits, research on company-own and \nconsumer perceptions of the brand, and the creation of design solutions that bring \ncolours, materials, typography, music and so forth into line with brand values. The \ndevices and strategies employed reflect the occupation\u201fs dual goals of augmenting \nproducts via brand values and shaping consumer tastes for those values. Unlike other \npromotional agents (such as those working in advertising), brand consultants regard \na company\u201fs entire material presence as media, from the font used on stationary to \nthe outfits worn by representatives at trade shows, and thus the devices employed \nreflect the \u201eextended spatial scope\u201f (2008: 415) of the occupation, and in turn help \nredefine what counts as media from a promotional point of view.  \n \nDevices to add value, however, will differ between cultural intermediary \noccupations, relative to the scope and object of their domain. For example, Entwistle \nfocuses on the case of fashion buyers, drawing on interviews and participant \nobservation in a high end retailer in London to explore how these individuals are \n\u201eactive in defining, shaping, transforming, qualifying and requalifying products\u201f \n(2006: 704). In the most straightforward sense, fashion buyers add value by filtering \nwhat goods make it to market: Entwistle highlights how buyers\u201f selections are based \non judgements of an item\u201fs shape, colour and feel, alongside knowledge of its \nsaleability based on notions of taste, trends and fashionability in a particular retail \ncontext (2006: 713). (For an interesting reversal of perspective, Skov\u201fs (2002) work \nconsiders the experiences of Hong Kong fashion designers, whose access to the \n 9 \nmarketplace is mediated by buyers\u201f conceptions of what is marketable.) In addition, \nbuyers add value through the \u201epedagogic role of store placement\u201f (2006: 715): \nconsumers are encouraged to regard an item in a particular way through strategies of \nproduct organization and display (e.g. where it is located within the store relative to \nother high status goods).  \n \nReturning to the case of branding consultants, Moor\u201fs research suggests that \nparticular dispositions or forms of subjective knowledge are the precondition for \nidentifying and implementing appropriate value-adding devices. Of note are \nbranding consultants\u201f sensitivity to aesthetic content and consistency, their mentality \nthat assumes \u201eabstract brands and values can be expressed through particular \nmaterials\u201f (2008: 419), and their experiential outlook on brands as total, immersive \nentities (2008: 416). It is not that branding consultants\u2014or cultural intermediaries \ngenerally\u2014have a monopoly on such dispositions. Indeed, sociology of \nconsumption research has suggested that individuals, broadly, have a quest for \naesthetic consistency (e.g. McCracken 1988) and the experiential qualities of \nconsumption (e.g. Campbell 1987). Nevertheless, cultural intermediaries are unusual \nin that such dispositions can be strategically honed and deployed in the formation of \nvalue (for the promoted product, and cultural intermediaries themselves).  \n \nFurthermore, branding consultants make claims to expertise based on membership in \nan elite \u201ecult of creativity\u201f (Moor 2008: 422) and possession of specialized \nknowledge and cultural capital that accrue from education, professional experience \nand personal biography. Similarly, Mellor\u201fs (2008) consideration of research on \nArab journalists highlights how a command of other languages and foreign travel \nexperience act as capital, supporting claims for professional credibility; and \nWright\u201fs (2005) study of book selling reveals how bookshop workers rely on \ninstitutional and embodied cultural capital to assert their difference from, and thus \nsuperior cultural authority over, other retail workers. These examples, among many, \nare suggestive of an exceptionalist disposition for cultural intermediaries, through \nwhich they mark out their difference from other cultural producers and service \nworkers engaged in comparable tasks. It is the exceptionalist disposition that \nconverts cultural intermediaries themselves into devices, in two, related, ways. \n \nFirst, cultural intermediaries become devices themselves in the sense that their \nbiographies, attitudes and embodied capital serve as occupational resources and \nguarantors of credibility. For example, comparing their research on creative workers \nin the advertising and magazine publishing fields, Nixon and Crewe (2004: 131) \nnote how such occupations disrupt \u201eestablished divisions between \u201cwork\u201d and \n\u201cleisure\u201d\u201f given the emphasis placed on socializing as a platform for accruing \nvaluable social and cultural capital. Credibility as a creative, in short, required a \nmetropolitan lifestyle (Nixon and Crewe 2004: 138), in much the same way as \ncredibility as a personal trainer draws heavily on personal physique (Smith Maguire \n2008), competence as a fashion retailer is read off of personal appearance (Pettinger \n2004), aesthetic authority as a fashion designer is evidenced in personal lifestyle and \n 10 \nhome d\u00e9cor (Rocamora 2002), and reliability as an advice columnist is accomplished \nthrough the representation of a sincere persona (McKay 2008).  \n \nSecond, arising from their particular dispositions (shaped through biography, class, \nage, sexuality and so forth) is the peculiar capacity of cultural intermediaries to serve \nas \u201eproxy consumers\u201f (Ennis 2005 in Moor 2008: 422). For example, Moor discusses \nconsultants\u201f ambivalent attitude towards market research, often relying on their own \npreferences in assessing what \u201eworks\u201f for a brand strategy. Expertise in the form of a \npeculiar sensitivity to the market lies in consultants\u201f capacity to identify with \nconsumers, often thanks to sharing the same demographic profile (2008: 422), \nthereby making the market knowable and, ideally, predictable. In short, branding \nconsultants are valuable to the extent to which they can read (and, in cases, typify) \nthe target market.  \n \nSimilarly, in the British \u201elads mags\u201f magazine industry, Crewe (2003: 183) explains \nhow editorial figures \u201ewere all instinctive in technique\u201f and their \u201eidentities, \nresources and ambitions were perhaps unusually important in imprinting their titles.\u201f \nEditorial work in this sense involves the inseparable connection between work and \nnon-work, and the overlapping of personal interests and preoccupations and \nprofessional expertise (2003: 193). Cultural intermediaries\u201f personal experiences as \nconsumers, for instance, are essential to their ability to \u201eread the market\u201f and \nconstruct a sense of the ideal consumer (Gough-Yates 2003; Nixon 2003; Soar \n2000). An ability to read the market on the basis of personal subjective knowledge \n(capital) is therefore the source of their expertise. Bearing these examples in mind, it \nbecomes clear that the role of cultural intermediaries cannot be reduced to the \nroutinized strategies found in textbooks or the findings of consumer research. Their \nclaims for the uniqueness\u2014indeed, indispensability\u2014of their professional input \nspeaks to the inseparability of devices and dispositions in practice. \n \nAssessing impact. Building on the concerns outlined above, the third front on which \nto consider cultural intermediaries concerns the occupation\u201fs actual impact on the \nprocesses of value formation. This requires attention to the flow of advice, \nconsequences of decisions and ongoing qualification of goods. On this basis, it is \npossible to provide a realistic assessment of the cultural economic significance of \ncultural intermediaries, and thus temper grand claims regarding their role as the \n\u201etransmission belt\u201f (Bourdieu 1984: 365) of a new consumer economy.  \n \nOn this third front, Moor (2008: 420) assesses the impact of branding consultants \nwith reference to their capacity to: \nfirst identify various qualities, values and ideas that will be meaningful and \nrecognizable to a specified target audience, and then to find or create a series \nof replicable design features that will reliably convey these preferred ideas and \nassociations in visual and material form. \nWorking from this definition of the occupation, Moor can then trace the impacts of \nbranding consultancy, including the content of brand campaigns, related product \ninnovation and the creation of company databases and manuals. In the same way by \n 11 \ntracing material practices, other studies highlight the material results of, and inherent \nconstraints on, the cultural authority of cultural intermediaries, from determining a \nretailer\u201fs purchase, to framing a customer\u201fs impression, of fashion stock (Entwistle \n2006; Pettinger 2004); or from making consumers\u201f anxieties and desires intelligible \nto producers, to making producer values coherent to consumers (Cronin 2004; Moor \n2008). \n \nBeyond their concrete consequences, Moor (2008: 409) also nods to a broader \nsignificance of branding consultants \u201ein the service of governance and forms of \nsocial organisation.\u201f Through the interplay of devices and dispositions, branding \nconsultants play a role, more generally, in the orchestration of production and \nconsumption, through the creation of \u201ereliable\u201f pathways between product attributes \nand perceived consumer desires. This assertion rests on an understanding of \nmarketing as a governmental technology in keeping with contemporary power \nrelations (Foucault 1991), which is directed at \u201emobilizing\u201f consumers by \nconnecting their perceived desires and anxieties with product attributes so as to \nencourage the enactment of their freedom within the marketplace in appropriate \nways, and thereby (ideally) accomplishing a seamless flow between supply and \ndemand (Miller and Rose 1997; Zwick et al 2008). To study cultural intermediaries \nsuch as branding consultants is thus to study key agents charged with the \n\u201egovernmental\u201f mobilization of consumers. Thus, assessments of impact may look \nbeyond the formation of value to the role of cultural intermediaries in the \nreproduction of contemporary social orders.  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn the article, we have offered an introduction to the theoretical foundations and \nelaborations of the concept of cultural intermediaries, and reviewed empirical \nfindings arising from its application in a range of cultural economy case studies. \nDrawing parallels between various case studies provides a clear demonstration of the \ncomplexity of the concept. Cultural intermediaries are not a monolithic occupational \nclass; they are internally stratified along a number of lines, including historical \ndevelopment, associated levels of cultural authority and social prestige, and the \ndiffering forms and degrees of aesthetic labour and cultural capital required to \naccomplish their work in the formation of value. \n \nFurthermore, we have sought to demonstrate that cultural intermediaries are \u201egood to \nthink with,\u201f throwing up a range of empirical and theoretical questions about the \nnature and import of their material practices. Thus, we suggest that cultural \nintermediaries are a useful, if as yet underutilized, entry point to the study of media. \nWhile not unique in foregrounding the practices and processes of production, the \ncultural economic approach has a number of benefits. By focusing on the cultural \nworker, such research necessarily is attentive to issues of power, agency and \nnegotiation, to the material (and quotidian) practices and conventions that contour \nmodes of work, and to the unintended outcomes and conflicts that arise when \nvarious forms of mediation intersect. \n 12 \n \nIn concluding, we note with Entwistle (2006: 707) that rather more attention has \ncentered on cultural intermediaries\u201f identities and lifestyles at the expense of close \ninvestigation of the actual processes of mediation. The specific practices and \nprocesses of how value is formed and added to cultural goods, the interconnections \nof various intermediaries operating in and across various fields, and how such \ncultural work can be conceptualised generally remain fertile areas for further study, \ndiscussion and debate.  \n \nBourdieu\u201fs (1984) formulation of cultural intermediaries, if often speculative, \ninspired (and continues to inspire) a range of scholars, who have moved beyond the \ninitial focus on media workers per se while retaining the concern with the mediation \nof production and consumption (if losing sight of the stratification of bourgeois and \npetite bourgeois fractions). Cultural economic analyses of cultural intermediaries \ncontinue to foreground the \u201erelational work\u201f (Cochoy 2003 in du Gay 2004: 100)  \nthat goes on between production and consumption, while historicizing Bourdieu\u201fs \naccount and pursuing empirically-grounded assessments of the devices, dispositions, \nimpacts and limitations involved in a range of occupations. There are, therefore, \ntensions and synergies that remain between Bourdieusian and cultural economic \nperspectives on, and definitions of, cultural intermediaries. Looking more closely at \nthe activities and outputs of cultural intermediaries, there is a room for developing a \ngreater sense of: the formation of occupational dispositions, through education, \nprofessionalization, class habitus, and so forth; the articulation and negotiation of \ntensions that arise between objective credentials and subjective dispositions in the \nperformance of authority; the tension between formal strategies and informal tactics \nemployed in bringing goods to, and contextualizing goods for, the market; and the \nways in which cultural intermediaries identify (with) and represent an intended \nmarket.  \n \nThe focus on case studies has added much to our knowledge, but the body of \nresearch on cultural intermediaries has yet to develop a comparative element (at the \nlevel of research design, as opposed to an evident comparative element in the \nanalysis of case study findings and reviews of literature). New comparative research \nwould move us closer to grasping the materiality of what Cronin (2004) describes as \nthe \u201eregimes of mediation.\u201f Examinations of the ecology within commodity chains \ncould assess the relative status and interconnections of cultural intermediaries \noperating within the same, and across cultural fields. In the same way, much would \nbe gained from cross-cultural comparisons of cultural intermediaries operating \nwithin the same field, and cross-field comparisons of cultural intermediaries \noperating at comparable positions in the commodity chain (calling attention to the \nrelative universality or (cultural or field) specificity of particular forms of value and \ntheir production). Additionally, comparisons of cultural intermediaries operating in \nthe same field could also be made of those working with goods that occupy different \nstatus positions (calling attention to the question of autonomy for those working with \ngoods of restricted production compared with those working with goods of mass \n 13 \nproduction). Thus, the examination of the interconnections between cultural \nintermediaries and the media remains a fertile field, with much work to be done. \n \nReferences  \n \nAmin, Ash and Thrift, Nigel.
