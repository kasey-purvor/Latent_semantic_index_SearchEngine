Keeping in mind the wider evolution of the traditional \nlabour movement, we study the emergence of musicians\u2019 unions \nin these international circumstances and analyze the \ntransnational relations between the French, British and \nAmerican associations, which culminated in the creation of the \n1904 International Confederation of Musicians. Finally, as \nunions were exchanging ideas and ultimately influencing each \nother, we consider the possibilities and impossibilities of \ntransnational militant transfers in an industry where the \nattitude towards art and labour was essential and ultimately \nso rooted in national identity. \n \nIntroduction \nAt the end of the year 1893, tensions had arisen in New York \nbetween the conductor Walter Damrosch and the American \nNational League of Musicians founded in 1886. Against the \nunion\u2019s persistent demands, the conductor was employing a non-\nunionist Danish cellist in his orchestra. Damrosch was himself \na member of the union and knew its rules all too well as he \nhad already been fined for a similar offence. Spectacularly, \nduring a representation at the Carnegie Hall on the \nseventeenth of December 1893, as Damrosch raised his baton to \n  \n \n3 \nsignal the start of the concert, not one musician moved, \nleaving the room filled with an uncomfortable silence. Though \nthe audience protested and even sided with the conductor, this \ndemonstration of power was the only entertainment they would \nwitness that night, as the concert was ultimately cancelled. \nMore importantly, the conductor was fined once again and the \nDanish musician was dismissed. The power of the union had been \nestablished.  \nWhether it was praised or criticized, this act of \nresistance on the part of American artists had a resounding \neffect on professional musicians around the world. After all \nthis was the first time that musicians had so publicly stepped \nout of their artistic role to become for a moment simple \nworkers. The impact of the event was particularly strong in \nFrance and Britain where, in 1893, the future of musicians\u2019 \nunionization was still uncertain. Admittedly, since 1890 a \nFrench Syndicat des Artistes Dramatiques, Lyriques et \nMusiciens had achieved some success. It was predominantly \nactive on the judiciary field and notably obtained the first \nlegislations on health and safety in secondary theatres in \n1893 and on artistic agencies in 1894.1 But it could only dream \nof leading such a concerted action when, until its disbanding \nin 1895, its principal struggle was to make its members pay \ntheir fees.2   \nIn Britain, the Amalgamated Musicians\u2019 Union (AMU) was \nformed only seven months prior to the Damrosch incident. It \nwas thus received as an encouraging omen, the confirmation \nthat the tools of traditional unionism were perfectly \n  \n \n4 \napplicable to the musical field. Enthused by the achievement \nof their American colleagues, AMU musicians from Liverpool \nrefused to play, in June 1894, when their manager suggested he \ncould open his theatre for three extra weeks if they agreed a \ncut in their wages. The quarrel resulted in full wages for all \nthe musicians except the horn players. This first success \nattracted new members to the union across the whole of \nBritain.3   \nFor more conservative professionals, the Carnegie Hall \nepisode was a most shocking account, unworthy of musicians\u2019 \nrespectability. Amongst others, the London Orchestral \nAssociation, which emerged in 1893 too, was quite embarrassed \nby this display of public hostility. In fact, it felt \ncomforted by the notion that musicians could only improve \ntheir situation by keeping a low profile. In January 1894 it \nthus felt ready to unconditionally declare its moderate aims: \n'This Association was established essentially for defence, and \nit must be borne in mind that when the Association is well \narmed for defence it must not become its purpose to be \naggressive. The Executive Committee must at all times be calm \nand proof against any instigation to precipitate acts'.4 \nThe circumstances of the American conflict are symptomatic \nof the developing concert industry with its large audiences \nand cosmopolitan orchestras. Its resonance on French and \nBritish musicians is indicative of the international dimension \ntaken by the music domain in the last third of the nineteenth \ncentury. At a time when the advance of the press and transport \ndrastically increased global communication, transnational \n  \n \n5 \nmusical relations were remarkably intense and played a crucial \nrole in the growing success of popular music worldwide. As we \nwill see, many artists, singers and instrumentalists were in \neffect touring the globe, making compulsory stops in France, \nBritain and the United States, which remained the three main \ncentres of Western musical life until after the end of the \nFirst World War.  \nThis unprecedented situation facilitated the exchange of \nmoderate and conservative ideas between the most skilled \nmusicians. But as the music milieu was democratising, it also \ncreated the perfect conditions for more radical militant \ndialogues and transfers between British, French and American \nprofessional musicians who were starting to organize \nthemselves into unions. \nIt is obvious that the history of musicians\u2019 unions has to \nbe put into the broader perspective of the history of \ntraditional labour organizations, and we will refer to this \nfrom time to time. Characteristically, they follow a similar \npattern: the evolution from mutual protective associations to \nclosed elitist craft unions then to more opened industrial \ngroups and finally confederations. But in many respects these \nevolutions are the direct consequences of the emerging musical \nindustry and of the changes it creates for the artistic \nprofession. Musicians appear to be doing all they can to \ndistinguish themselves from mainstream workers and, perhaps in \nsome ways, rightly so.  \nThe opposition between art and labour is central to the \nway they think about themselves. This attitude is quite \n  \n \n6 \nunique, even within the artistic field. Music, unlike painting \nfor instance, is originally immaterial and thus historically \nit did not have a value. Court musicians would receive a \npension to allow them create freely. It was never a payment in \nexchange for a production.5 Only the vulgar street musician was \npaid for his song. It may seem to be a rhetorical subtlety but \nthe distinction is in fact essential. The industrialization of \nmusic shook these long established truths and forced musicians \nnot only to put a value on their work, but to fight for it. \nThe accent put on art by late-nineteenth-century performers \nwas a way of resisting these changes; it was also a response \nto their low symbolic status, at a time when only composers \nwere respected. By reclaiming their artistic nature musicians \nwere trying to gain a lost legitimacy.  \nThe study of early musicians\u2019 organizations presents some \nobstacles. At the end of the nineteenth century, the musical \nmilieu was extremely divided and this impacted directly on the \ndevelopment of unions. Performers and teachers, skilled and \nunskilled musicians, instrumentalists and singers, \ninstrumentalists from legitimate and secondary theatres, \nmusic-hall instrumentalists and music-hall singers, army \norchestras and civil orchestras, etc. etc., would rarely join \nforces, so drastically opposed was the nature of their work, \ntheir artistic and economic status.  \nThe best illustration of this phenomenon was the fact that \nsingers, be they lyrical or popular, traditionally enrolled in \nassociations formed by actors rather than musicians. Singers, \nlike actors, were indeed stage artists, reaping most of the \n  \n \n7 \naudience\u2019s interest and recognition as well as the performance \nfees. Meanwhile, instrumentalists were, for the most part \nhidden from the public eye and existed only as part of another \nanonymous performing ensemble. Whereas they enjoyed strong \ngroup socialization, singers mainly worked on their own. In \nthe end the two groups had very little working experience in \ncommon, except of course for the performance of music itself.  \nTherefore, until the 1890s, musicians formed multiple \nsmall associations whose influence was originally limited to a \ntown or a region. By definition they had very little power and \nwere doomed to be short-lived. The body of sources available \nto the researcher is thus vast and scattered and so attempting \nto draw an absolute chronology of musicians\u2019 unions is an \narduous endeavour. \nIn this article we will mostly be concerned with two types \nof professional musicians: instrumentalists and music-hall \nsingers. As we will soon observe, they represented both ends \nof the nineteenth-century music industry. They were also the \nmost mobile and the most active in terms of unionization. As \nmusic turned into a popular leisure activity and the ability \nto play a musical instrument became a requisite of any \nrespectable Victorian education(for young women in \nparticular), teachers formed the majority of the music \ncontingent at the turn of the century.6 But in many respects \nthe domestic nature of their activity and its relative \nimmobility protected them from the radical changes experienced \nby performing artists.  \n  \n \n8 \nThis paper aims to examine the changing state of the music \ntrade from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1920s and \nthe conditions of performing musicians during this period in \nFrance, Britain and the United States. We will study how these \ncircumstances lead to the unionization of musicians and will \nconsider the ways in which the industialization of music \nimpacted on the nature of musicians\u2019 unions in the three \ncountries at stake. We will then analyze the transnational \nrelations between early French, British and American \nmusicians\u2019 unions and we will try to determine how these \ninteractions shaped the development of these organizations \nboth nationally and internationally. This study will not be \nfully tripartite though, as the American venture will be \nprincipally considered through its influence on French and \nBritish unions. \nA fourth influential territory could have been included in \nthis cross-national landscape: Germany. The case of skilled \nGerman instrumentalists is especially interesting as many \nplayed in British, French and American orchestras at the turn \nof the nineteenth century and notably, their presence was \npredominant in every early American musicians\u2019 association.7 \nTypically, Walter Damrosch\u2019s orchestra was composed of many \nGerman nationals not to mention Damrosch himself.8 We will \ntouch on this side of the story sporadically but for reasons \nof time mainly we are consciously, though not without any \nregret, consigning most of this aspect to further research.     \n \nThe entertainment industry \n  \n \n9 \nMusicians\u2019 unions, like most traditional labour movements, \nemerged in the dual context of an ever expanding industry and \never degrading working conditions. The second half of the \nnineteenth century marked the birth of the \u2018entertainment \nindustry\u2019 in Europe and the United States. It then relied \nessentially on the development of popular public concerts. The \nsuccess of recorded music, which we still today associate with \nthe concept of a music industry (for how long though?), only \nstarted in the 1910s with the invention of the record and \ntriumphed at the end of the 1940s with the introduction of the \nmicrogroove. True, the Edison wax cylinder had made the \nrecording of music available to the public since 1889. But if \nthis technology was revolutionary, it never became a household \ndevice. The expansion of the nineteenth-century music industry \nchanged the life and work of musicians once and for all and \nfrom its very start it exposed all the challenges lying ahead \nfor artists.  \n \n  The conditions of performing musicians \nBritish Victorian and Edwardian popular entertainment will \nforever be associated with the fame of the first music-hall \nstars such as Marie Lloyd, Albert Chevalier or Harry Lauder. \nYet, the reality for most musicians, and especially secondary \norchestral instrumentalists, could not have been further from \nthis picture postcard imagery. The fates of music-hall stars, \nlike those of the privileged musicians of legitimate theatres, \nwere in fact the exceptions in a profession where struggle and \ndestitution dominated.     \n  \n \n1\nAs the success of popular concerts grew, competition \nwithin the music professional market soared. Encouraged by the \ndevelopment of music publishing and cheaper musical \ninstruments, many amateurs saw in musicianship an easy way to \nmake money in a booming industry. Thus, when the British \npopulation almost doubled between 1879 and 1930, the number of \nmusicians (including music teachers) is thought to have \nmultiplied by seven, jumping from seven thousands to fifty \nthousand.9 Prior to this, academies, conservatoires and \ntraditional professional associations could, to some extent, \ncontrol the access to the profession. Now they found \nthemselves incapable of channelling this new mass of self-\nproclaimed musicians and daunted by the challenges of a \ncapitalist musical industry.  \nMany newcomers were highly unqualified and ready to accept \nany position at any condition. As with any other trade, the \ncompetition between skilled and unskilled musicians \nefficiently eroded the profession\u2019s wages. In addition, \nnumerous publicans realized they could increase their \nclient\u00e8le by providing music and entertainment. More and more \ntaverns were thus converted into music and theatre rooms. But \nthe welfare of employees was the least of their concerns and \nacceptable security and hygiene standards were rarely met.  \nBefore the 1870s, some regulations did attempt to control \nthe development of these places of entertainment. However, \nthey mostly aimed at protecting moral values and preserving \nthe privileges of legitimate theatres rather than attempting \nto regulate the working conditions of musicians. Thus, until \n  \n \n1\n1867, French caf\u00e9s wishing to provide entertainment for their \npatrons were not allowed to display artists in costume. D\u00e9cor \nother than a fixed curtain were strictly forbidden and, behind \nthe performers, elegantly dressed women had to sit in a semi-\ncircle called \u2018la corbeille\u2019 (\u2018the basket\u2019), to convey a sense \nof respectability to the establishment.10 Aside from this last \nGallic eccentricity, the British 1737 Theatre Act imposed some \nsimilar restrictions on unlicensed theatres.11  \nYet no general legislation on the working status of \nmusicians was passed before the beginning of the twentieth \ncentury. As the industrialization of music drastically changed \nthe nature of musicians\u2019 occupation, the very definition of \nmusicianship became a problem for the legislator. Even if \nmusicians could be considered to be employees of a theatre: \nwho was to determine the length of working days or the \nremuneration of working hours? This resounding lack of \nregulation resulted in ruthless management, especially for \ninstrumentalists performing in music halls and secondary \ntheatres.  \nContracts depended wholly on the goodwill of directors \nwhose entrepreneurial thirst was rarely tainted by humanist \nfeelings. Musicians who were absent through illness often \nreturned to work to find that someone else had replaced them \nfor good. Amongst other things, rehearsals, which took several \nhours of the day, went for a long time unpaid. Of course, if \nmusicians dared to protest against their treatment they were \nhappily shown the door where many anxious candidates where \nwaiting to replace them.  \n  \n \n1\nPushed to the limit by their meagre salaries, artists \noften multiplied simultaneous contracts inside or outside the \nmusic trade. From the mid-1890s onwards, a system of \u2018twice-\nnightly\u2019 performances was further introduced, extending the \nlength of working days that little bit more. Finally \nengagements were mostly short-term, ranging from weekly to \nseasonal. Musicians were thus perpetually forced into \nunemployment and, so as to find work more efficiently, \nregistered with an agency which could cipher up to twenty-\nfive-per-cent off their salaries. The expression \u2018orchestra \npit\u2019 suddenly seemed to take on a whole new meaning.  \n \n  The mobility of performing musicians \nIn this context, mobility became, more than ever, an essential \nfeature of musicians\u2019 lives. Of course, from the Renaissance \nonwards, it was common for street musicians to travel from \ntown to town in order not to saturate their audience and to \nearn sufficient money to get by. In fact \u2018immobility\u2019 has \nalways been something of a historical anomaly, the privilege \nof a handful of musicians attached to a Church, a court or \nlater a national orchestra. Until the 1850s though, musicians\u2019 \nperegrinations were mainly regional. With the \nindustrialization of music and the progress in transport and \ncommunication in the last third of the century, they embraced \na larger national and soon international dimension.  \nTypically, most musicians spent the winter months in the \nlarge urban centres where all the work was then concentrated. \nLater, during the summer season, they were obliged to change \n  \n \n1\nscene and gravitated to the seaside resorts, temples of the \nnew holidaymakers. According to the 1871 census, the \npopulation of Blackpool then varied from 6,000 inhabitants in \nwinter to 600,000 in summer. Musicians logically followed \ntheir audience wherever they went and tried to earn wages in \nhotels and casinos.  \nA growing number of musicians also performed abroad. In \nthe case of music hall this type of itinerancy was often \nextremely organized and artistes were rarely left to \nthemselves. Impresarios travelled around Europe and the United \nStates in the hope to find the new talents that would delight \ntheir public back home. A year after the Entente Cordiale \nbetween France and Great Britain was signed, the entrepreneur \nThomas Barrasford even set up an Anglo-French company of \nperformers who successively toured in his halls in France and \nBritain.12 Joining such a troupe meant not having to worry \nabout the next contract or the next season.  \nAmongst others, Harry Fragson, a London born singer who \nwas French on his father\u2019s side, enjoyed a dual career in \nFrance and Britain, switching languages, accents and \nrepertoires as he criss-crossed the Channel.13 A success in \n\u2018Gay Paree\u2019 for a British singer was equivalent to a success \nin London for a French singer: the first step towards \ninternational recognition. In both cases, a breakthrough in \nthe United States represented the ultimate international \nconsecration, enhancing in return any national career. The \nFrench singer Anna Held luckily took this path. After one of \nher performance in London in 1896 she was approached by the \n  \n \n1\nAmerican producer Florenz Ziegfeld. She soon became his wife, \nmoved to New York and became one of Broadway\u2019s favourite stars \nof the 1910s and 1920s.14 Although the American public adopted \nher, she always remained the exotic French artist she had been \nwhen she first set foot in the United States.  \nAdmittedly a few orchestras such as the French Les \nConcerts Lamoureux, The British Hall\u00e9 Orchestra and the New \nYork Philharmonic earned a fame of their own and toured the \nworld like any other renowned solo artist would. But for most \norchestral musicians, performing abroad was first and foremost \na question of survival. At a time when the London stage was \nbooming in the 1870s and 1880s, European instrumentalists \nperceived the British capital as their best chance to make a \nliving in music. Some, more adventurous, even crossed the \nAtlantic.15 The earlier centralization of French and German \nmusical education meant that Britain and the United States \nwere comparatively late in implementing a high quality music \ninstruction. They were thus generally less qualified than \ntheir European colleagues.16 But this situation began to change \nat the end of the 1880s. The French musical paper L\u2019Europe \nArtiste described in February 1894 how \u2018boatloads\u2019 of \n\u2018ravenous\u2019 continental musicians arrived every day in London, \nimagining the city \u2018paved with gold\u2019 only to find their \nillusions quickly shattered.17 As more influential music \ninstitutions were created, the skills of British and American \nmusicians were improving; they were also protecting themselves \nfrom foreign competition by forming new professional \norganizations.  \n  \n \n1\nThe mobility of musicians also greatly facilitated \ntransnational artistic exchanges. As artists and directors \nexported their acts and skills aboard and imported some back \nhome in return, internationalism often became \ninterculturalism. The French revue format was, for instance, a \nmajor source of inspiration for both British variety and \nAmerican vaudeville in the early days of the twentieth \ncentury. The presence of ballet dancers within French and \nAmerican light entertainment of the 1910s was a direct \nimportation of a long established British tradition. Finally \nthe success of Foxtrot songs in the European popular \nrepertoire of the time was a distinctly American influence. \nMany French artists took English sounding names: Max Dearly, \nAlice Delysia, William Burtey, Little Chrysia, Louise Daisy, \namongst others.18 Many British and American female singers \ninsisted on having their name preceded by a glamorous \nMademoiselle. \n \nMusicians\u2019 unions: a transnational awakening \nIn some respects the itinerancy of musicians put a brake on \nthe emergence of much needed unions. The wandering musician \nwas rarely able to sign in and defend his rights in the long \nterm. Which local union should he join anyway when he did not \neven work in the same region all through the year? And how \ncould conflicts with a theatrical director be efficiently \nsolved if the personnel were constantly changing? Nevertheless \nthese circumstances also helped unify the musical milieu and \nspread the unionist word. As they changed employers and \n  \n \n1\ncolleagues on a regular basis, musicians realized that their \nsituation was not unique and that others shared similar \ndifficulties. In this way national and transnational dialogues \nbetween artists and their associations were greatly \nfacilitated. \n \nMusicians organize themselves \nNot differing from traditional Labour History, numerous \nmusical professional organizations anticipated in the UK, \nFrance and the United States the establishment of unions as \nsuch. On the one hand, there were many mutual benefit \nsocieties that tried to help musicians and their families \nthrough sickness, unemployment, retirement and death. Many of \nthese did not disappear with the emergence of unions. Amongst \nothers were The Royal Society of Musicians of Great Britain \ninstituted in 1780, the French Association des Artistes \nMusiciens (AAM) created in 1848 and the American Musical Fund \nSociety of 1849. These were high-profile associations that \nwere open to artists who could prove their musicianship. \nParadoxically, their respectable veneer sometimes allowed them \nto act beyond the traditional roles of mutual insurance. For \ninstance the AAM, headed by the reputable Baron Taylor, opened \na powerful judiciary bureau. It sued many directors who had \nlitigiously fired an artist or refused to pay the wages stated \nin the contract, etc.19 Laws as such were rarely disputed \nthough; it was their application that was called into \nquestion. \n  \n \n1\nA second strain of pre-union societies aimed primarily at \nprotecting the artistic status of the profession by \nrestraining its access. This is typical of the closed craft \nunions. In this way, it was thought, the social recognition of \nmusicians could be fair and justified. By means of strict \nexaminations and recommendations by peers, only skilled \nartists were allowed to join. This form of control was mostly \nrelevant to teachers and legitimate theatre instrumentalists \nwho experienced privileged working conditions.  \nIn France, the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique founded in 1669 \nand its nineteenth-century follower, the Conservatoire, played \nthis role. In Britain, the schools of music present in every \nmajor university fulfilled a comparable position; the Royal \nAcademy of Music created in 1822 was indeed far less powerful \nthan its French counterpart. Later, the more centralized \nNational Society of Professional Musicians of 1882, the \nIncorporated Society of Musicians of 1892 and the Union of \nGraduates in Music of 1893 followed similar elitist goals. One \nof the limitations of these movements was that not only did \nthey impose professional canons, they also favoured very \nspecific forms of music. As the popular music industry became \nthe largest employers of musicians, their restrained \ndefinition of the professional and his art suddenly appeared \nobsolete.  \n \nMusicians\u2019 unions \nMany musicians\u2019 associations, which were in effect \u2018unions\u2019, \nwere often reluctant to adopt the name for fear it would \n  \n \n1\ntarnish the respectability of their members, this is a common \nfeature of traditional labour group of the late nineteenth and \nearly twentieth century. In the case of musicians, the \nartistic nature of their occupation made this positioning even \nmore problematic and determining. Musicians recognized the \nnecessity of improving their conditions and they were starting \nto acknowledge that musicianship was changing. But the \nconflating of interests of art and labour, implied by the use \nof the word \u2018union\u2019, was simply unbearable to most of them. \nThis is why some associations studied here neither bear the \nname nor declare themselves \u2018union\u2019.  \nThe American National Musical Association, founded in \n1871, may well have been the first veritable union to emerge \nfrom the three countries under consideration. Although its \ninfluence remained limited during its ten years of activity, \nit opened seventeen local branches and remarkably, its scope \nwas already national when, on the other side of the Atlantic, \nmusicians were struggling to unite at all. In the 1870s, \nFrance and Britain had some success in doing so only locally. \nIn 1872, a short-lived Chambre Syndicale des Choristes, \ngathering members of the chorus, was registered in Paris. 1874 \nsaw the creation of the Manchester Musical Artistes\u2019 \nProtective Association and the Birmingham Orchestral \nAssociation in Britain. Two years later, in 1876, the Syndicat \ndes Artistes Instrumentistes de Paris (SAIP) was created in \nFrance.20 The organization, which lasted until 1882, was in \nfact very weak. It was torn between the necessity to improve \nthe fate of instrumentalists, the will to promote the musical \n  \n \n1\nart and to set musicians apart in the world of labour. The \ntitle of its official journal exemplified this dilemma very \nwell: Le Progr\u00e8s Artistique (literally \u2018artistic progress\u2019).  \nInterestingly, the use of the word \u2018syndicat\u2019 did not seem \nas problematic to French musicians as that of \u2018union\u2019 to their \nAnglophone colleagues. As the mildness of these first French \nassociations\u2019 actions suggests, this Gallic particularity had \nmore to do with the specific nature of politics and \nlegislation in France than to the stronger militant \ninclinations of its musical professionals.  \nLarger and better-structured unions emerged during the two \nfollowing decades. Modern militant labour organizations were \nmaking the most of the failures of traditional protective \nartistic societies. Supplanting the 1886 American National \nLeague of Musicians, the American Federation of Musicians \n(AFM), which still exists today, was founded in 1896. It was a \nhuge movement, one of its New York subdivision representing \nmore than ten thousand members alone. From the very start, it \njoined the American Federation of Labor; a controversial \ndecision that proved decisive for its future accomplishments.21 \nAt its peak, the 1890 Syndicat des Artistes Dramatiques, \nLyriques et Musiciens (SADLM), mentioned in the introduction, \ngathered nearly seven thousand members.22 Even if we suppose \nthat only half of these were actually paying their fees, the \nsyndicat was still significantly bigger than its predecessors \nthe AAM and the SAIP, which at their most hardly reached two \nthousand members. The larger scale of the association was due \nto the fact that it welcomed not only instrumentalists and \n  \n \n2\nsingers but also actors. One of its major pleas was the \nrecognition of musicians as workers - a measure which would \nhave allowed them to appeal to industrial tribunals.23 Although \nthe unions disbanded ten years before the status was finally \ngranted in 1905, this demand marked a decisive turn for French \nunions. \nIn 1893 the Amalgamated Musicians\u2019 Union (AMU) was the \nfirst British musicians\u2019 organization to assume the \u2018U-word\u2019 \nunlike the London Orchestral Association (later National \nOrchestral Association \u2013 NOA) established the same year.24 As \nwe will see in the next part, the AMU originated some very \nradical directives which brought it many industrial victories. \nAccording to J.B. Williams, founder and General Secretary of \nthe AMU, \u2018the snobbish pride of many musicians who considered \nthey would lower their dignity and prestige if they joined \nother wage-earners in the Trade Union Movement\u2019 was the \nbiggest difficulty the union encountered.25 After years of \nconflicts with the NOA, both associations merged in 1921 and \nformed the powerful British Musicians\u2019 Union which still \nthrives today. It originally united around twenty-two thousand \nmusicians, merely a tenth of which were former NOA members. \nSnobbishness seemed to have reached its limits. In the \nmeantime many more French unions were founded and almost \nimmediately dissolved. In 1901, the Syndicat des Artistes \nMusiciens de Paris joined forces with other local associations \nto form the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Artistes Musiciens de France in \n1902 - the first real French national musicians\u2019 union. By \n1912 it included forty-two local unions and ten thousand \n  \n \n2\nmembers, more than any previous French musicians\u2019 organization \nand approximately the same of the British AMU. \n \nFrom correspondents to transnational combination \nIf the chronology varies slightly, the creation of musicians\u2019 \nunions in Britain, France and the United States was greatly \nmotivated by the successes and failures of unionization in \neach respective country. Encouraged by their international \nmobility, there was a strong feeling amongst artists that any \nachievement abroad was a potential victory at home and that \nultimately they were all fighting together.  \nUnions\u2019 journals from the time make a very interesting \ncase study in that respect. Instrumentalists working abroad \nsent articles back to their union. They often gave news about \nthe musical life of the country where they were working. They \nalso sent reports on the actions undertaken by foreign \nmusicians\u2019 associations. Some unionists became official \n\u2018correspondents\u2019. They coordinated the selling of militant \nliterature to their fellow expatriates. They met local unions\u2019 \nrepresentatives and occasionally acted as delegates for their \ncountry in meetings with foreign associations. Sometimes, like \none correspondent of the AMU in Johannesburg, they even helped \nset up a union from scratch.26 Journals were also filled with \nforeign work advertisements. They would offer special deals to \nmusicians wishing to cross the Channel; even on occasion going \nso far as providing the timetables for the ferries. \nIn the 1890s, the progress of American musicians was \nparticularly admired, as their force and unity was envied by \n  \n \n2\nboth British and French unionists. This is what we observed \nwith the Carnegie Hall incident. The American example was \nunashamedly instrumentalized to help debunk the harshest \ncriticisms. Hence when the creation of the AMU faced strong \nopposition in the British musical press in 1893, the union \nretorted by publishing in its official organ a long address \nfrom the President of the Musical Mutual Protective Union of \nNew York (part of the National League of Musicians), relating \nthe advance of his association. \u2018The beneficial influence of \nour Union was felt in other directions,\u2019 he declared. \u2018With \nthe demand for higher wages came a demand for better \nperformers, ability began to assert itself, the chaff was \nsifted from the wheat and the standard of our profession was \ngradually raised\u2019.27 This was a direct answer to those \nprofessionals who believed that the elevation of musicians\u2019 \nteaching and image was the key to better wages and that on the \ncontrary unions could only deteriorate their status and \nconsequently their working conditions. The following year the \njournal La France Th\u00e9\u00e2trale, organ of the SADLM, printed over \ntwo issues a history of the American National League of \nMusicians, presenting at length its status and its aims.28 The \nsubtitle to the article clearly stated the purpose of \nreporting the American endeavours: the \u2018improvement of the \nposition of musicians in France\u2019.29  \nBy inviting foreign unionists to official meetings and by \nreporting in the professional press what was happening for \nmusicians abroad, unions were trying to instil motivation and \nfaith in professionals who, for the most part, remained \n  \n \n2\nreluctant to join a labour affiliated association. They were \nalso looking for inspiration. \n \nMilitant exchanges and transfers \nThe difficulties that musicians had to face in Britain, France \nand the United States were very similar: the perverse system \nof agencies, the absence of a minimum wage, the absence of a \nstandard contract, the difficult relationship with conductors \nand theatre directors, the competition from military and \nforeign musicians, the treatment of so-called \u2018amateur\u2019 \nmusicians, etc. In this unified international context it then \nseemed logical for unionists to try and import any successful \nsolution implemented by their foreign counterparts. The form \nof organization to adopt and the types of actions to lead were \ndistinctively well observed.  \n \nAmateurs, women and popular musicians \nThe attitude of unions towards amateurs was a crucial question \nthat divided musicians. Untrained musicians were invading the \nmusical market and, though merely a cog in the music industry \nmachine, they were held responsible for most of the economic \nproblems then facing musicians. Their growing number and \nmeagre art had to be tackled. Unskilled workers constituted a \nproblem across the entire trade union movement. The \nspecificity with musicians was that amongst these so-called \namateurs were in fact numerous part-time skilled \nprofessionals. In order to supplement their insufficient \nartistic salary, many were indeed forced to find another \n  \n \n2\nsource of income in a traditional trade. The most high-\nqualified musicians felt that the inclusion of amateurs and \nsemi-professionals was totally unsustainable, as it \nrepresented a threat to their symbolic status. To them, \u2018real\u2019 \nmusicians could only be full-time learned musicians. In terms \nof union efficiency, the inclusion of both amateurs and semi-\nprofessionals was of course the best solution. This \nclassically new unionist choice increased the membership of \nthe organizations and thus provided a robust stature for \nfuture conflicts. Importantly, it diminished the risks of \nunfair competition and, in this way, enforced the \nestablishment of a minimum wage, which had always been the \nprinciple demand of unions.  \nThe British AMU was the first union to make a positive \nstatement on that matter. Its status clearly specified: \n\u2018anyone practising the art of music\u2019 could join.30 This implied \namateurs as well women whose access to most professional \nassociations was equally under dispute. It also meant that \nmusicians of all specialities could join: theatre as well as \nmusic halls instrumentalists. \u2018There is no bad music\u2019, the \nGeneral Secretary said. \u2018All music is good\u2019 and \u2018good music \ndoes not mean classical music\u2019.31 With the same progressive \nfervour the union denied access to conductors and army bands \nwith whom they often had a conflict of interest. It had also \nbecome affiliated to the Trade Union Congress as early as May \n1894.  \nThe 1902 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Artistes Musiciens (FAM) was \nclearly inspired by the statutory system of the AMU. Its \n  \n \n2\nfounders understood that openness would increase their power \nand influence. \u2018Anyone declaring themselves musicians\u2019 could \nbe admitted \u2018without any restrictions\u2019.32 This was a ground-\nbreaking stance for French musicians. Local unions registered \nat their Bourse du Travail, officializing their links with \ntraditional trades. Interestingly, following a more \nconservative line, the federation also sought legitimate \nsupport. The renowned composers Gustave Charpentier and Alfred \nBruneau accepted the joint presidency of honour of the \nassociation. As we have seen earlier with the 1876 Association \nSyndicale de Artistes-Musiciens Instrumentistes de Paris, \nartistic respectability was vital for French unions. It seemed \nextremely difficult for most unionists to unconditionally \nassert, like the American National League of Musicians did in \n1887, that musicians were \u2018laborers in the field of music\u2019.33 \nLabour actions always had to be validated by an additional \nartistic discourse if not by legitimate figures of the musical \ndomain. This is still the case for contemporary French unions.  \n \nIndustrial alliances \nAnother subject of exchanges concerned the confederative \nsystem. The British AMU admired the French example. In 1919 \nthe French FAM was disbanded so that every one of its unions \ncould directly adhere to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Spectacle CGT, the \nart division of the French general trade confederation. This \nmeant that instrumentalists could now team up with lyrical \nsingers, chorus singers, actors, writers and also theatrical \nemployees.34 Thus, a trade federation gave way to an industrial \n  \n \n2\nconfederation. This form of grouping made complete sense in \nthe case of theatre where instrumentalists, singers and non-\nmusicians shared the same employer. In the event of conflicts \nwith a director and even more so during a strike, the \ndifferent unions represented within the confederation could \nstand together and thus have more chance to see their demands \nsatisfied. \nAs a British delegate wrote in 1919, \u2018the success attained \nby the French Society brings to the front again the suggestion \nput forward in this country for a society to amalgamate the \nActors\u2019 Association, The Variety Artistes\u2019 Federation, the \nNational Association of Theatrical Employees, and the \nMusicians\u2019 Union\u2019.35 In the end this amalgamation was never \nachieved but the motivation was there. From 1900 onwards, the \nAMU had managed to establish this type of vertical cooperation \nby signing alliances with the Society of Waiters, the \nTheatrical and Music-hall Workers\u2019 Union and later, the \nNational Association of Theatrical Employees. Typically, they \nregularly protested as one to oppose to renewal of the \nlicences of unscrupulous theatre or music-hall directors.  \nIn the early days of the twentieth century the AMU was \nalso becoming more and more vocal within the Trade Union \nCongress, tying stronger links at the political level. Many \nproblems faced by musicians were discussed at the annual \nsessions of the TUC from 1907 onwards, especially the soaring \ncompetition of army and navy bands.36 From this date, which \ncorresponds to the first general strike lead by British \nmusicians, J.B. Williams, Chairman of the AMU, became a member \n  \n \n2\nof the TUC Parliamentary Committee. He even had the honour of \nappearing on the group photos published in the first pages of \nthe TUC reports for the year 1909.  \n \nDirect Action \nIn case of conflicts, the dilemma of whether or not to use \nstrike or any form of direct action was as palpable for \nmusicians as it was for other workers. The British AMU and the \nNOA were fundamentally opposed on this point. Disagreements \nwithin the American National League of Musicians on this \nmatter resulted in the emergence of the American Federation of \nMusicians. Once more the cherished respectability of musicians \nand the reluctance to use working men\u2019s methods often stopped \nthem from implementing what a conservative musical observer \ndescribed as \u2018violence in pursuit of [...] illegal objects\u2019.37 \nThe public dimension of performers' occupation also meant that \nnot only did they have to justify any direct action to \nthemselves, they also had to face the opinion of the audience \nwho were literally 'watching' them. The choices made by \nforeign musicians were here again studied closely. \nThe 1893 Damrosch incident was a turning point. The \nAmerican union had sabotaged a performance. They had also \nchallenged the directorship of the almighty conductor in view \nof the public and for many, musicians and theatre goers, this \nwas simply unthinkable. Hierarchy was extremely codified and \nrespected amongst orchestras. Conductors were at the summit of \nthis pyramidal system but they were also in charge of the \norchestra\u2019s fee and decided which musicians could stay and \n  \n \n2\nwhich should go. To the more radical-thinking unions they were \nthe closest collaborators of theatre directors and were thus \npartially culpable for the exploitation of musicians. For the \nmost moderate organizations, the stage was simply not the \nplace for protest. 'To strike upon the platform, in full view \nof the audience, is, no doubt, going very far,' the LOA wrote \nin its Gazette. 'As things go here, we believe that orchestral \nplayers will say that the concert platform is not the place \nfor a strike,' the article concluded.38 The impact of the event \nwas thus considerable as it forced musicians\u2019 associations to \ntake side and, for some of them, to radicalize their discourse \nand actions.  \nAlthough the AMU and the SADLM waved their unionist flag \nhigh, until the early twentieth century, British and French \nunions limited most of their actions to the judiciary field, \npatching, where possible, the lack of regulations on the work \nof musicians and the abuse this situation implied. To my \nknowledge too, they never protested directly on the stage, \npreferring to boycott theatres and demonstrate on the street \nwith the common worker. In October 1902 French musicians \nlaunched their first general strike in Paris, to obtained \nbetter wages. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Artistes Musiciens, \nresponsible for the action, received encouragements from the \nAmerican Federation of Musicians who called for the solidarity \nof European musicians. And this is exactly what happened. \nAmongst others, the AMU wrote a letter to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \nasking for a list of the composers who opposed them. Their \nbranch in Hull having heard that Mr Saint-Sa\u00ebns was opposing \n  \n \n2\nthe strike unanimously voted to refuse to play his work.39 \nBritish artistes followed the French initiative in 1907, in \nwhat became known as \u2018the music-hall war\u2019.40 Interestingly, the \nsuccess of the French movement was mainly due to the large \nparticipation of respectable and qualified instrumentalists. \nIn fact, the strike struggled to catch on in the popular music \nhalls and caf\u00e9s-concerts. On the contrary, the success of the \nBritish action was due to the unions\u2019 strength within the \npopular music domain.  \nThe AMU closely collaborated with the Variety Artistes\u2019 \nFederation and the National Association of Theatrical \nEmployees, which meant that instrumentalists, as well as \nperformers and theatre workers were united. They drafted a \ncommon \u2018Charter of the National Alliance\u2019, asking for better \nwages and working conditions, and decided on the boycott of \nany theatre that refused to comply with their demands.41 In \nLondon, twenty-two theatres were forced to close down in \nresult of the strike. It lasted one month with mass pickets \nand celebrity speaking tours. Indeed, the \u2018vocal\u2019 support of \nmany music-hall stars such as Marie Lloyd, Little Tich or Gus \nElen was a deciding factor. Their fame helped publicize the \nmovement and bring the support of the public who realized, \nperhaps for the first time, that musicians did not all enjoy a \nwealthy and glamorous life. A union\u2019s poster could read: \n\u2018Support the Stars who are supporting their less fortunate \nFellow-Artistes\u2019. \n \nThe International Confederation of Musicians \n  \n \n3\nNot satisfied with influencing one another, French, British \nand American musicians\u2019 unions sought to establish strong \ninternational connections with each other. The type of \ninformal dialogues described previously turned into official \ntransnational cooperation in the early years of the twentieth \ncentury. In 1901, the International Artistes\u2019 Lodge (IAL) was \nformed. It gathered stage artistes\u2019 associations representing \nthe interest not only of singers but also actors, comedians, \nacrobats, animal tamers, etc. Three years later the \nInternational Confederation of Musicians (ICM) was founded in \nFrance and this time it mainly grouped unions representing \ninstrumentalists. J.B. Williams of the British AMU made an \nenthusiastic speech in Paris on this subject. As many \nmusicians went to work abroad, he explained, cooperation on an \ninternational level was essential in order to create peaceful \nrelations between musicians and thus contribute to the \nadvancement of their condition. \u2018Musicians cannot and mustn\u2019t \nthink about borders,\u2019 he claimed. \u2018The interests of each \nmusician, whatever his nationality, must be the common \ninterests of every musicians\u2019.42  \nThe competition of foreign musicians was as problematic \nfor unions as that of amateur musicians. International \nalliances could only be beneficial for all. The possibility of \nimposing a standard European wage via the International \nConfederation was investigate thoroughly but ultimately turned \nout to be a dead end. Nevertheless, the ICM and the IAL made \nit possible for musicians to consult the rates offered in the \ncountry they were travelling to. In this manner they could \n  \n \n3\nensure that their employer paid them correctly and that they \nwere not unfairly contending with local professionals.  \nOnly a few months after the creation of the ICM, the \nAmerican Federation of Musicians wrote an open letter to \nEuropean musicians via the Confederation\u2019s bureau. Following a \nconflict in New York, the city\u2019s directors were threatening to \nemploy European musicians if American musicians did not accept \nthe conditions they were offered. The AFM asked European \nmusicians to put into practice their solidarity and refuse any \noffer coming from New York. The AFM\u2019s letter and the \ndirectors\u2019 ultimatum were fully reproduced in French and \nBritish unions\u2019 journals and the dispute ended favourably for \nAmerican musicians.43  \n \nConclusion \nThe industrialization of music created problematic working \nconditions for musicians. Paradoxically, it also provided the \ntools to tackle those changes. The musical milieu was a world \nof extremes. Famous music-hall singers toured the world and \nmade a fortune whilst anonymous orchestral musicians struggled \nto make a living from their art. Nevertheless the \ninternationalized nature of the music industry meant that \ndespite specific cultural contexts, the musical domain was \nexperiencing similar challenges and ultimately, it was \nunifying. In particular, the mobility of performing musicians \nallowed them to develop a greater sense of belonging, beyond \ntraditional national boarders. It was then that transnational \n  \n \n3\nmilitant interactions and cooperation became possible. For the \nsame reasons, transnational artistic exchanges also increased.  \nMilitant transfers, like musical transfers, can sometimes \nbe clearly analysed. The rules of admission of the 1901 \nParisian Chambre Sydicale des Artistes Musiciens were thus \novertly based on the status of the 1893 Amalgamated Musicians \nUnions. In other instances, the line between inspiration and \nadditional encouragements is very slim. The varying natures of \nindustrial relations at a national level, and the relative \nsizes of musicians\u2019 unions, also meant that not every system, \nnot every solution could be strictly applicable. Thus, British \nand American musicians attempted to solve conflicts theatre by \ntheatre, forging alliances locally where they were needed. On \nthe contrary, French unions attempted to gain legal \nrecognition on a national level and for this reason joined a \nnational industrial confederation. But whereas the British \nMusicians\u2019 Union founded in 1921 united all musicians, from \nthe classically trained singer to the self-taught \ninstrumentalists, French artistic unions have, until this day, \nalways preferred to stay divided. We observed further \ndifferences with the case of direct action. French musicians \nsought the support of respectable composers when British \nmusicians instrumentalized the role of music-hall celebrities. \nThe opposite would have been extremely unlikely and certainly \ntotally inefficient.  \nIn any case, through their journals, unions were able at \nleast to bring enthusiasm and hope to their members. The \nadvancement of American musicians, in particular, was a \n  \n \n3\nconstant source of motivation for British and French unions. \nThe creation of the International Confederation of Musicians \nin 1904 proved that the interest of musicians for their \nforeign colleagues was not just a passing phase and that, in \nan industry characterized by strong transnational relations, \nan international confederation represented the ultimate \nmilitant tool. According to Serge Wolikow and Michel \nCordillot, \u2018internationalism far from being the simple \nnegative consequence of nationalism,\u2019 is in fact \u2018present from \nthe very origin of national organisation\u2019.44 As we have \ndemonstrated this is certainly true of early musicians\u2019 \nunions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n  See La France Th\u00e9\u00e2trale, 1893 and 1894. \n2\n  La France Th\u00e9\u00e2trale, 1 January 1894. \n3\n  Mike Jempson, The Musicians\u2019 Union: A Centenary Celebration (London: The Musicians\u2019 Union, \n1993), p. 8. \n4\n  The Orchestral Association Gazette, January 1894. \n5\n  See for instance Marcelle Benoit, Versailles et les musiciens du Roi 1661-1733: \u00e9tude institutionnelle \net sociale (Paris: Picard, 1971). \n6\n  See Cyril Ehrlich, Social Emulation and Industrial Progress \u2013 The Victorian Piano (Belfast: The \nQueen\u2019s University of Belfast, 1975). \n  \n \n                                                                                                                                                        \n3\n7\n  Robert D.
