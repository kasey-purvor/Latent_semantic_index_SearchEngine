On a seasonal basis, algae population densities can soar, challenging the 32 \nremoval efficiency of treatment processes. A commonly employed treatment chain for 33 \nalgae removal is coagulation-flocculation-dissolved air flotation (DAF). During DAF 34 \ntreatment, negatively charged, microscopic bubbles collide and attach to influent 35 \nparticles, floating them to the surface where they are removed. Successful flotation is 36 \nreliant upon influent particles having both a minimum particle diameter of 37 \napproximately 10-30 \u00b5m (Edzwald, 1995), and a surface charge that approaches 38 \nneutral (Han et al., 2001), equating to a zeta potential of approximately -10 mV to +5 39 \nmV (Henderson et al., 2008d), to ensure effective particle-bubble collision and 40 \nattachment efficiencies respectively. Algae are negatively charged and many common 41 \nspecies are less than 10 \u00b5m in diameter therefore coagulation and flocculation 42 \nprocesses are included to adjust the size and charge of the algae cells accordingly.  If 43 \ncoagulation is unsuccessful, poor flotation can occur which results in high coagulant 44 \nand cell residuals causing downstream filter blockage or breach (Henderson et al., 45 \n2008a, Henderson et al., 2008b).  Residual algal matter can form disinfection by-46 \nproducts (DBP) such as trihalomethanes (THM) (Chen et al., 2008, Nguyen et al., 47 \n2005) or be responsible for offensive taste and odour compounds or toxic metabolites 48 \n(Haider et al., 2003, Rosen et al., 1992).   49 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 3 \nCoagulation of algae cells can be difficult as a result of their widely variable 50 \nphysical and chemical characteristics (Henderson et al., 2008b), including complex 51 \ncell morphologies, such as spinal appendages preventing close contact of cells 52 \n(Bernhardt and Clasen, 1991); cell motility, enabling liberation from flocs (Pieterse 53 \nand Cloot, 1997); variable surface charge (Henderson et al., 2008d); or algogenic 54 \norganic matter (AOM) sterically interfering to prevent agglomeration, increasing the 55 \nnegative charge at the cell surface and complexing with metal coagulants thus raising 56 \nresidual coagulant concentration (Bernhardt et al., 1985, Pivokonsky et al., 2006, 57 \nTakaara et al., 2004).  These characteristics generally act to increase coagulant 58 \ndemand and it has been suggested that consequently coagulant cannot be added on a 59 \nstoichiometric basis (Bernhardt et al., 1985), as is usual for inert, inorganic particles 60 \n(Stumm and O\u2019Melia, 1968).  Earlier studies suggested that only microscopic, 61 \nspherical cells can be coagulated according to charge neutralisation mechanisms 62 \n(Bernhardt and Clasen, 1994, Tilton et al., 1972) thus allowing optimum coagulant 63 \ndosage to be estimated stoichiometrically. However, these conclusions resulted from 64 \nstudies investigating coagulation followed by direct filtration and may not apply for 65 \nflotation processes.  While numerous studies on the flotation of algae have been 66 \nconducted (Edzwald, 1993, Kempeneers et al., 2001, Teixeira and Rosa, 2006), no 67 \nstudies have investigated the link between coagulation-flotation and algal 68 \ncharacteristics. Specifically, the impact of variable morphology and AOM 69 \ncomposition on coagulation and removal by flotation requires investigation and this 70 \nwill be the focus of the current paper.    71 \nThe authors recently undertook a study examining the AOM characteristics of four 72 \nalgae species \u2013Chlorella vulgaris (micro, spherical, green algae), Microcystis 73 \naeruginosa (micro, spherical cyanobacteria), Asterionella formosa (large, elongated, 74 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4 \ncolonial diatom), and Melosira sp. (large, filamentous diatom) (Henderson et al., 75 \n2008c) (Table 1). The major differences in AOM characteristics were associated with 76 \ncharge density, hydrophobicity, protein content and molecular weight (MW).  AOM 77 \nfrom C. vulgaris had a charge density of 3.2 meq g-1 and a hydrophobicity of 11 % 78 \nwhereas that of M. aeruginsosa had a charge density of 0.1 meq g-1 and a 79 \nhydrophobicity of 30 %.  Much less protein was present in AOM extracted from the 80 \ndiatoms - A. formosa and Melosira sp., compared with C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa.  81 \nAdditionally, C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa had larger MW AOM in comparison to 82 \nA. formosa and Melosira sp., where 45 % of M. aeruginosa AOM was greater than 83 \n500 kDa in comparison to less than 10 % of C. vulgaris AOM (Henderson et al., 84 \n2008c).  It is anticipated that the differences may impact considerably on coagulant 85 \ndose for optimum removal.  Hence, the major objective of this study was to treat the 86 \naforementioned algal cultures using coagulation-flocculation-DAF and link the 87 \ncoagulation conditions required for treating each species by flotation to algal physical 88 \nand chemical character.    89 \nInsert Table 1 90 \n 91 \nMaterials and Methods 92 \n 93 \nAlgae Cultivation.  The following freshwater algae cultures were obtained from the 94 \nCulture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP), (Oban, Scotland): Chlorella 95 \nvulgaris (211\/11B \u2013 Delft, Holland); Microcystis aeruginosa (1450\/3 \u2013 Esthwaite 96 \nWater, Cumbria, England); Asterionella formosa (1005\/9 \u2013 Esthwaite Water, 97 \nCumbria, England), while Melosira sp. (JA386 \u2013 Redesmere, Cheshire, England) was 98 \nobtained from Sciento, Manchester, UK.  Growth conditions have previously been 99 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5 \ndescribed (Henderson et al., 2008c).  Algae were harvested for experiments in the 100 \nearly stationary phase.    101 \n 102 \nAOM Extraction.  AOM was extracted from all bulk algae suspensions with the 103 \nexception of Melosira sp. by centrifuging at 10,000 G for 15 minutes and 104 \nsubsequently filtering the supernatent through a 0.7 \u00b5m filter (Whatman GF\/F glass 105 \nmicrofibre).   AOM therefore comprises both extracellular organic matter (EOM), any 106 \nintracellular organic matter (IOM) that may have been present, and also loosely bound 107 \norganic matter, which may be dislodged via centrifugation (Henderson et al., 2008c) 108 \n 109 \nAlgae Cell Characterisation.  The algae systems were assessed using the following 110 \nmethods: 111 \na) Cell concentration \u2013 a light microscope was used to manually count cells with a 112 \nhaemocytometer and Sedgewick Rafter cells as appropriate.  Samples were left to 113 \nsettle onto the grids for 15 minutes. At least 100 cells were counted in triplicate.   114 \nb) Cell surface area \u2013 images of cells were obtained microscopically and sized using 115 \na scale generated using a graticule.  The dimensions were used to produce surface 116 \nareas using basic geometric shapes as follows: C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa 117 \nwere sized using a spherical surface area = 4\u03c0r2; A. formosa and Melosira sp. were 118 \nsized using a cylindrical surface area = 2\u03c0r2 + 2\u03c0rh.  In each case the dimensions 119 \nof 100 cells were measured. 120 \nc) Charge density \u2013 The back titration method utilised was adapted from an 121 \nestablished method (Kam and Gregory, 2001). The specific procedure was that 122 \nutilised for determining AOM charge density was previously reported (Henderson 123 \net al., 2008c).  Three different volumes of algae were analysed.   124 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6 \nd) Zeta potential \u2013 A Malvern Zetasizer 2000HSA (Malvern, UK) was utilised to 125 \ndetermine the zeta potential of the system. 126 \n 127 \nCoagulation and Dissolved Air Flotation.  Stock algae suspensions were diluted 128 \nprior to treatment to a concentration more often observed in supply reservoirs using 129 \ndeionised water to which 0.5 mM NaHC03 and 1.8 mM NaCl had been added.  See 130 \nTable 2 for initial algal concentrations.  Bench scale coagulation and flotation was 131 \nundertaken using an EC Engineering Dissolved Air Flotation Batch Tester, Model 132 \nDBT6 (Alberta, Canada).  Aluminium sulphate coagulant was added to 1 litre of algae 133 \nsuspension at the beginning of a 2 minute rapid mix (200 rpm), during which pH was 134 \nadjusted to either pH 5 or 7 using 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl as required.  135 \nCoagulation and flotation experiments were undertaken at pH 7 for all algae species 136 \nand additionally at pH 5 for M. aeruginosa and C. vulgaris.  It has previously been 137 \nobserved that algae may not start agglomerating until more than 7 minutes of slow 138 \nmixing has passed (Henderson et al., 2006), attributed to a lag time in charge 139 \nneutralisation (Clasen et al., 2000).  For this reason flocculation time was 15 minutes 140 \nof slow mixing (30 rpm) rather than 5 minutes which is usually more normal for 141 \nflotation processes.   After flocculation, the paddles were gently removed and air 142 \nsaturated deionised water with 0.5 mM NaHCO3 and 1.8 mM NaCl was supplied at a 143 \npressure of 450 kPa and recycle ratio of 12 %.  The algae-bubble agglomerates were 144 \nallowed to float for 10 minutes.   145 \nSamples of the clarified water were obtained from sampling ports located 5 cm 146 \nfrom the vessel base for analyses by cell count and zeta potential as previously 147 \ndescribed and DOC using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A analyser.  All analyses were 148 \nperformed in triplicate.   149 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7 \nThe same coagulation-DAF experiment was also undertaken for AOM 150 \nextracted from C. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa at pH 7.  Samples were 151 \nadjusted to approximately 5 mg L-1 by dilution using deionised water with 0.5 mM 152 \nNaHC03 and 1.8 mM NaCl.  At the early stationary phase, cell concentrations for  C. 153 \nvulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa were 1.2 x 107 cells mL-1,1.5 x 107 cells mL-1 154 \nand 2.9 x 105 cells mL-1 respectively., thus requiring the extraction of approximately 155 \n140 mL, 350 mL and 900 mL respectively of algae per jar test to provide sufficient 156 \nAOM.   Subsequent analyses included residual aluminium by atomic absorption 157 \nspectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 800 (Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK), 158 \nDOC and zeta potential. 159 \n 160 \nResults and Discussion 161 \n 162 \nAlgae System Characterisation 163 \n 164 \nM. aeruginosa and C. vulgaris cells are microscopic spherical cells and therefore had 165 \nfar greater initial cell concentrations and smaller individual cell surface areas when 166 \ncompared with the much larger diatoms of A. formosa and Melosira sp. (Table 2).  167 \nCharge equivalents, presented on a per cell basis, were in the range 0-1.88 peq cell-1 168 \nwhere M. aeruginosa had the smallest charge density and Melosira sp. the largest.  169 \nThe charge density of each species increased with increasing pH.  This is attributable 170 \nto dissociation of carboxylic acid groups, similar to that observed for natural organic 171 \nmatter (NOM) (Kam and Gregory, 2001).  AOM concentration for the cell 172 \nconcentrations examined in this study were in the range 0.6-1.5 mg L-1 as C.   By 173 \ncomparison of the charge density of AOM alone (Table 1) and the whole system of 174 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 8 \ncells and AOM, an estimate of the contribution of charge by AOM was calculated.  175 \nAOM was found to contribute 84%, 5% and 30% of the charge of the system for C. 176 \nvulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa respectively while for Melosira sp. the AOM 177 \nhad negligible charge density (Table 2). 178 \nInsert Table 2 179 \n 180 \nAlgae-Coagulant Interactions 181 \n 182 \nA log linear relationship between the ratio of the coagulant dose (as aluminium) to 183 \ncell charge equivalence (coagulant:charge ratio) and the zeta potential was observed 184 \nfor all four algae systems coagulated at pH 7 (Figure 1).   This relationship is relevant 185 \nas it quantifies the effectiveness of coagulant in neutralising the charge of the algal 186 \nsystem.  Figure 1A depicts the relationship when coagulation the entire algal system, 187 \nincluding cells and associated AOM, while Figure 1B shows the relationship when 188 \ncoagulating only AOM extracted by centrifuging and filtration.  The gradients of the 189 \nlog-linear relationships in Figure 1A were 22.8, 13.6, 9.5 and 11.0 mV meq mg-1 for 190 \nC. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa, A. formosa and Melosira sp respectively, indicating that 191 \nthe coagulant was significantly more effective at neutralising the charge of C. vulgaris 192 \nin comparison to the other three species.  The coagulant:charge ratios required to 193 \nachieve neutralisation were 183, 456, 1290 and  2781 mg meq-1 for Melosira sp., C. 194 \nvulgaris, A. formosa and M. aeruginosa respectively. These ratios are comparable 195 \nwith the literature as one study determined that the spherical cyanobacteria, 196 \nSynechocystis minuscular, required a coagulant (Al):charge ratio of 1400 mg meq-1 at 197 \npH 6 for complete neutralisation (Bernhardt and Clasen, 1994).   198 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9 \nThe resulting gradients for Figure 1B were 16.3, 20 and 11.5 mV meq mg-1 for 199 \nC. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa respectively and thus, while the gradient 200 \nobtained for A. formosa was very similar to that observed for the entire system, those 201 \nof C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa were less than and greater than those obtained for 202 \nthe entire system, respectively. The coagulant:charge ratio required to achieve 203 \nneutralisation for C. vulgaris was 263 mg meq-1, as opposed to the much larger values 204 \nof 2426 and 6017 mg meq-1 for A. formosa and M. aeruginosa respectively.  The 205 \ncoagulant:charge ratio was therefore 1.7 times less than that required for 206 \nneutralisation of the entire C. vulgaris system while that of A. formosa and M. 207 \naeruginosa was 1.9 and 2.2 times greater.   208 \nInsert Figure 1 209 \n 210 \n 211 \n 212 \nIn general, differences observed in zeta potential vs coagulant dose curves are 213 \nexplained in terms of varying pH, charge density or complexation of coagulant.  214 \nHowever, each experiment was conducted at the same pH and the coagulant dose was 215 \nnormalised against the charge density of the algae or AOM. Hence, the different doses 216 \nrequired to achieve a neutral zeta potential and gradient reflect a difference in 217 \ncoagulant interaction mechanism with the cells and AOM, particularly with respect to 218 \ncomplexation.  It is known that at pH 7 the concentrations of dissolved cationic 219 \nhydrolysis products are relatively low and the system is dominated by the negatively 220 \ncharged aluminate ion (Al(OH)4-) and by amorphous Al(OH)3 precipitate (Duan and 221 \nGregory, 2003).  This precipitate has an isoelectric point at pH 8 as a result of surface 222 \n\u2261Al\u2013OH+ groups and is thus positively charged at pH 7.  Hence, surface complexation 223 \nis likely to occur between these cationic sites and dissociated \u2013COOH groups which 224 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10 \nare generally attributed to charge in an algae system (Bernhardt et al., 1985).  225 \nAdsorption of negatively charged AOM and cells to amorphous precipitates may also 226 \noccur such that a net decrease in negative charge results (Duan and Gregory, 2003).  227 \nA low gradient such as that exhibited by A. formosa indicates that this neutralisation 228 \nmechanism is relatively inefficient in comparison to larger gradients, such as that 229 \nexhibited by C. vulgaris.   230 \nExplanation for the differences in efficiency of neutralisation lies in the system 231 \ncharacter and particularly that of the AOM as it will be closely associated with the 232 \ncells.  For example, the M. aeruginosa system required approximately six times the 233 \ncoagulant:charge ratio of C. vulgaris for complete neutralisation.  This increased to 22 234 \ntimes in the case of the AOM.  The AOM of M. aeruginosa has a very low charge but 235 \na significant protein concentration of 0.64 mg protein mg-1 DOC (Table 1) and, while 236 \nthat of C. vulgaris is also significant at 0.40 mg protein mg-1 DOC, previous studies 237 \nhave demonstrated that only the cyanobacteria protein and not green algae proteins 238 \nhave the appropriate characteristics for protein-coagulant complexation (Pivokonsky 239 \net al., 2006; Takaara et al., 2004; Takaara et al, 2007).  The fact that the gradient of 240 \nthe AOM curve for M. aeruginosa was relatively steep but that charge neutralisation 241 \nwas not instigated until a much larger coagulant:charge ratio had been achieved 242 \nsuggests that initially aluminium coagulant was consumed by protein complexation 243 \nsuch that it was unavailable for charge neutralisation.  In the case of A. formosa, the 244 \nrelatively high coagulant:charge ratio that was required for neutralization relates to 245 \nboth an increased point of onset of neutralization as well as a relatively low gradient. 246 \nTo date, no studies have addressed the protein-coagulant complexation reactions from 247 \nAOM other than that extracted from C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa.  This represents 248 \nan area for future research, which would clarify the following proposed hypothesis. 249 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 11 \nThe fact that the onset point of neutralization lies between the other two systems 250 \ninfers a moderate influence of protein-coagulant complexation. However, comparison 251 \nof the protein:DOC ratio for the AOM from A. formosa reveals the lowest level of the 252 \nthree at 0.2, suggesting that the protein complexing power of AOM from A. formosa 253 \nmay be similar to that of M. aeruginosa and the difference may be just related to total 254 \nmass of available protein. In terms of the lower gradient, the size of the carbohydrates 255 \nappears important. In the case of A. formosa the carbohydrates were predominately 256 \nless than 1 kDa in size (81% of total) compared to 30% and 38% for the AOM from 257 \nC. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa respectively. These types of carbohydrates are known 258 \nto exhibit a low affinity for coagulant such that very large doses are required 259 \n(Bernhardt et al., 1985). The mechanism in this case is either a reduced complexation 260 \nprocess or direct adsorption onto precipitate. In either case, a shallower gradient can 261 \nbe expected as each unit of coagulant has less impact.  262 \n 263 \nRemoval Efficiencies of Cells, AOM and Aluminium  264 \n 265 \nCell Removal 266 \nThere were four coagulation regions for C. vulgaris at pH 5 (Figure 2): Zone 1 \u2013 a 267 \nregion of no removal at low doses; Zone 2 - an initial zone of removal at low dose that 268 \ncoincided with a reduction in the magnitude of the zeta potential (ZP) to +3.8 mV; 269 \nZone 3 - a restabilisation zone where ZP values were highly positive at +15 mV; and 270 \nZone 4 \u2013 a secondary removal zone at high coagulant doses.  Coagulant doses were 271 \nnormalised to surface area which has previously been demonstrated to be a useful 272 \npreliminary indicator of coagulant dose (Henderson et al., 2008b).  The coagulant 273 \ndoses giving the maximum removal efficiency for Zone 2 and Zone 4 removal were 274 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 12 \n0.0195 g m-2 (289 mg meq-1) and 0.742 g m-2 (11,027 mg meq-1) respectively 275 \nachieving 97.7 % and 96.8 % removal respectively.  This sequence of removal zones 276 \nis commonly observed for both organic and inorganic systems at pH 5, where Zone 2 277 \nremoval is attributed to charge neutralisation mechanisms while Zone 4 is attributed 278 \nto sweep flocculation mechanisms (Duan and Gregory, 2003).  In contrast, no 279 \nrestabilisation zone was observed for M. aeruginosa at pH 5, even upon reaching 280 \nhighly positive ZP values of +18.9 mV (Figure 2).   Furthermore, in contrast to C. 281 \nvulgaris, a far lower dose of 0.0087 g m-2 was required to obtain good removal 282 \ncorresponding to a ZP of -4.2 mV.  It is proposed that the absence of a restabilisation 283 \nzone is attributable to large MW proteins and carbohydrates acting as polymer aids 284 \nand overcoming repulsive electrostatic forces.   This is supported by previous work 285 \nthat showed that at pH 5 such polymers are only partially deprotonated (Bernhardt et 286 \nal., 1985).  In contrast, it is suggested that AOM did not prevent restabilisation of C. 287 \nvulgaris systems at pH 5 as the AOM was smaller with ~5 % larger than 500 kDa 288 \ncompared to ~45 % for M. aeruginosa (Henderson et al., 2008c) and therefore would 289 \nnot be as efficient a polymer aid.  290 \nInsert Figure 2 291 \n 292 \nAt pH 7, no restabilisation zone was observed for any of the algae systems.  293 \nOptimum coagulant doses were 0.7 to 1.36 mg L-1 as Al, which when normalised for 294 \ncell count were in the order 1.1 < 4.3 < 31.4 < 290 pg cell-1 for M. aeruginosa, C. 295 \nvulgaris, A. formosa and Melosira sp. (Table 3).  The value obtained for M. 296 \naeruginosa is comparable with that obtained for the similar organism, Synechocystis 297 \nminuscula, which had a coagulant demand at pH 6 of 1 pg Al cell-1 (Bernhardt and 298 \nClasen, 1994).  Doses per charge and surface area were also calculated as 383, 927, 299 \n508 and 154 mg Al meq-1 and 0.078, 0.012, 0.085 and 0.053 pg \u00b5m-2 for C. vulgaris, 300 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 13 \nM. aeruginosa, A. formosa and Melosira sp. respectively.  Corresponding zeta 301 \npotentials at optimum removal were -14.5 \u00b1 1.6, -10 \u00b1 2.2, -13.5 \u00b1 0.4 and 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 302 \nmV for the same species.  Optimum removal was similar for all species at between 303 \n94.8 and 99.7 % cells removed. 304 \nInsert Table 3 305 \n 306 \nThe dose required for C. vulgaris at pH 7 in terms of surface area was four times 307 \nhigher than at pH 5 (Figure 2).  This observation is a reflection of firstly the decrease 308 \nin charge density of the system, which was three times lower at pH 5.  Secondly, 309 \ndissolved cationic hydrolysis species as opposed to amorphous hydroxide precipitates 310 \ndominate and these are more effective neutralisers.  Interestingly, the corresponding 311 \ncoagulant:charge ratio decreased by only 1.3 times, as it only reflected the difference 312 \nin alum speciation having already been normalised for charge density.  In contrast, the 313 \noptimum coagulant demand of M. aeruginosa at pH 5 was 0.0087 pg \u00b5m-2, only 1.4 314 \ntimes less than that required at pH 7.  This is primarily a result of the change in alum 315 \nspeciation as the charge density of these algae was much lower than that of C. 316 \nvulgaris and therefore less significant.   317 \n 318 \n 319 \nAOM Removal 320 \nThe coagulant dose required to achieve maximum removal of AOM was 0.8 <1.2 < 321 \n1.5 mg Al mg-1 DOC for C. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa respectively 322 \n(Figure 3) at zeta potential values of 3.8 \u00b1 0.8, 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 and -7.9 \u00b1 0.7 mV for the 323 \nsame species.  Additionally, AOM was relatively treatable with removal efficiencies 324 \nof 71 %, 55 % and 46 % for C. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa respectively.  325 \nIn general these removal efficiencies are greater than those observed in a previous 326 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 14 \nstudy where AOM was coagulated using ferric chloride and removed by 327 \nsedimentation to yield removal efficiencies of 18 %, 25 and 50 % at pH 5 for the 328 \nspecies M. aeruginosa,  Scenedesmus quadricauda, Dictyosphaerium pulchellum 329 \nrespectively (Widrig et al., 1996).   The doses required to achieve maximum removal 330 \nefficiency are consistent with literature values for NOM which has a coagulant 331 \ndemand of approximately 1 mg Al mg-1 at neutral pH (Duan and Gregory, 2003).  M. 332 \naeruginosa required a larger dose than C. vulgaris, despite having a lower charge 333 \ndensity of 0.1 meq g-1 compared with 3.2 meq g-1 (Table 1), attributed to protein-334 \ncoagulant complexation increasing coagulant demand.  The high coagulant demand of 335 \nA. formosa can be explained by the low MW AOM causing inefficient flocculation, 336 \nwhere cross linking of the small MW AOM-aluminium compounds is required to 337 \nbuild flocs.  The high removal efficiency of C. vulgaris AOM is a result of the 338 \nmaterial being both highly charged and of relatively large MW such that flocculation 339 \nis efficient.   340 \nInsert Figure 3 341 \nAluminium Residual 342 \nResidual aluminium data revealed that high Al residuals of up to 65 % could be 343 \nanticipated for aluminium doses of less than 0.5 mg Al mg-1 DOC at pH 7 (Figure 4).  344 \nThe lowest aluminium residuals of 0.4 %, equating to a residual of 10-35 \u00b5g l-1, were 345 \nachieved for doses of greater than 0.8 mg Al mg-1 C (Figure 4), which is concurrent 346 \nwith optimum AOM removal (Figure 3).  This high initial residual and subsequent 347 \nlowering of aluminium at higher aluminium:DOC ratios has previously been observed 348 \nfor humic acid systems, where a dose of 0.54 mg Al:mg C was required to ensure low 349 \naluminium residuals (Jekel and Heinzmann, 1989).  Similarly, a study examining the 350 \ncoagulation of AOM originating from Chlorella with iron determined that residual 351 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 15 \niron was always found in the filtrate for doses of <0.2 mg Fe mg C-1 but never at 352 \ndoses of 1 mg Fe mg C-1 (Bernhardt et al., 1985).  This trend has been attributed to the 353 \ncoordination of AOM to metal-hydroxide polymers at low concentrations thus 354 \npreventing the cross linking and clustering of Al-hydroxide polymers which 355 \nconsequently only becomes possible at higher doses (Bernhardt et al., 1985, Jekel and 356 \nHeinzmann, 1989), when simultaneous removal of both AOM (Figure 3) and 357 \naluminium (Figure 4) occurs.  The fact that residual aluminium in the M. aeruginosa 358 \nsystems was similar to those of C. vulgaris and A. formosa indicates that protein-Al 359 \ncomplexates did not remain dissolved in solution and were bound into flocs by the 360 \naforementioned mechanisms.   361 \nWhile the treatability of cells, AOM and aluminium has been demonstrated, 362 \ntheir concurrent removal must also be considered.  If cells were removed 363 \npreferentially, then high residual AOM and consequently high aluminium levels could 364 \nresult.  At the dosages required to achieve maximum removal of , the ratios of 365 \ncoagulant:DOC were calculated to be 0.93, 1.4 and 1.7 mg as Al mg-1 DOC at pH 7 366 \nfor C. vulgaris, M. aeruginosa and A. formosa respectively, such that each was greater 367 \nthan the 0.8 mg mg-1 required for low residuals of both aluminium and AOM.   Hence, 368 \nfor the optimum coagulant doses, it is anticipated that removal of all three 369 \ncomponents would result.   370 \nInsert Figure 4 371 \n 372 \nRelationships Between AOM Character and Removal 373 \n 374 \nThe study demonstrated that, with appropriate application of coagulant, good removal 375 \ncould be anticipated for all of three system components \u2013 cells, AOM and aluminium, 376 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 16 \nirrespective of algae species.  The key difference between the systems was in the 377 \ncoagulant dose required to achieve maximum removal.  Analysis of the data presented  378 \nin this study, compared with that of another study (Bernhardt and Clasen, 1994) 379 \nreveals a log-log relationship between optimum dose and both cell surface area and 380 \ncharge density (Figure 5).  The relationship between coagulant dose and charge 381 \ndensity appears stronger than that of surface area, attributable to the fact that the 382 \ndissolved organic component is also taken into account in the former.  This is most 383 \nimportant as the charge demand generated by some species is predominantly 384 \nassociated with the AOM component.  For instance, in the case of C. vulgaris, 84 % 385 \nof the charge is associated with the AOM.    Other studies have reported a relationship 386 \nbetween the concentration of algae and coagulant dose and have attributed this to 387 \nincreases in surface area and thus charge density (Stumm and O\u2019Melia, 1968, Tilton et 388 \nal., 1972); however, these early studies were concerned with only one type of 389 \nmicroscopic, spherical algae.  Extending the analysis across multiple species then 390 \nreveals the importance of understanding the impact of charge density in determining 391 \nthe optimum dose (Figure 5). Detailed analysis of how the coagulant interacts with 392 \nAOM to reduce the charge reveals a number of different actions which describe the 393 \nzeta profiles away from the optimum point. The work presented here suggests the two 394 \nimportant characteristics of the associated AOM are the complexing strength of the 395 \nprotein components and the size of the carbohydrates as they appear to influence the 396 \nonset point of neutralization and the rate of neutralization respectively. Together these 397 \ndescribe the how the zeta potential of the system changes with coagulant addition and 398 \nprovides a route to determining the sensitivity of the system to changes in dose. 399 \nFurther work is required to confirm such suggestions by detailed analysis of the 400 \nprotein complexation relationships as previously reported for C. vulgaris and M. 401 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 17 \naeruginosa (Takaara et al., 2004). However, if confirmed, these two components 402 \nprovide potential diagnostic signals with which to track and predict changing 403 \ncoagulation requirements for algal systems. 404 \nThe findings outlined here indicate a similar relationship to that observed for 405 \nNOM, where coagulant dose was closely related to the charged component of the 406 \nwater (Sharp et al., 2006). The implications of such findings are that relatively simple 407 \ncharge measurement via zeta potential can be used to understand and control 408 \ncoagulation and flotation of algae, irrespective of morphological differences.  Zeta 409 \npotential is now being used in understanding practical issues related to the coagulation 410 \nof NOM rich waters within a region of the UK and has resulted in lower residuals, 411 \nmore stable systems and lower coagulant demands in certain sites (Sharp et al., 2007).  412 \nSurface area also provided a relationship with coagulant demand which could be 413 \nutilised to understand changes in dose requirements as different species predominate 414 \nin feed reservoirs.  In contrast, monitoring cell counts without reference to species, 415 \nwill not give an indication of coagulant demand as, on a per cell basis, the coagulant 416 \ndemand required for optimum removal varied between species by orders of 417 \nmagnitude.  Similarly, monitoring algae with respect to taxonomic grouping will not 418 \ngive any indication as to the coagulant demand.   419 \nInsert Figure 5 420 \nConclusions 421 \nSpecific conclusions are as follows: 422 \n1. Addition of coagulant to algae systems caused a neutralisation of the negative 423 \ncharge of both cells and AOM even at pH 7, although the efficiency of 424 \nneutralisations varied with differing system characteristics. 425 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 18 \n2. Good cell removal efficiencies in the range 94-99 % were obtained for all 426 \nalgae treated provided sufficient coagulant was added.   427 \n3. High MW, protein-rich AOM appears to act as a polymer aid in M. aeruginosa 428 \nsystems, resulting in the absence of a restabilisation zone at pH 5.   429 \n4. AOM removal efficiency was in the range 46-71 %. 430 \n5. Residual aluminium was always low provided sufficient coagulant had been 431 \nadded to ensure the maximum  removal efficiency of AOM had been achieved. 432 \n6. A strong correlation between charge density and coagulant dose was observed 433 \nfor all algae species at pH 7.  The indications are that charge measurements 434 \nwould provide a robust control for algae irrespective of physical and chemical 435 \ncharacteristics.   436 \n 437 \nFurther work is required to assess the application of such a model to real systems as 438 \nopposed to those artificially created using laboratory monocultures.  It is anticipated 439 \nthat the principles of the charge dependent process described in this paper should be 440 \napplicable in such a situation. 441 \n 442 \nAcknowledgements 443 \nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, 444 \nThames Water, and Yorkshire Water for their financial support. 445 \nReferences 446 \nBernhardt, H. and Clasen, J.
