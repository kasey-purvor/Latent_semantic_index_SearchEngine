We propose a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial of level of \ndependency and pre-operative fluid therapy in high-risk surgical patients undergoing major elective surgery.\nMethods\/Design: A multi-centre randomised controlled trial with a 2 * 2 factorial design. The first randomisation is to \npre-operative fluid therapy or standard regimen and the second randomisation is to routine intensive care versus high \ndependency care during the early post-operative period. We intend to recruit 204 patients undergoing major elective \nand urgent abdominal and thoraco-abdominal surgery who fulfil high-risk surgical criteria. The primary outcome for \nthe comparison of level of care is cost-effectiveness at six months and for the comparison of fluid optimisation is the \nnumber of hospital days after surgery.\nDiscussion: We believe that the results of this study will be invaluable in determining the future care and clinical \nresource utilisation for this group of patients and thus will have a major impact on clinical practice.\nTrial Registration: Trial registration number - ISRCTN32188676\nBackground\nPatients undergoing major elective or urgent surgery are\nat high risk of death or significant morbidity. Death\naround the time of surgery accounts for nearly one in 20\nof all deaths in the UK and the rates are not significantly\ndeclining. Amongst the patients who survive, many suffer\nmajor complications with subsequent impairment of\nhealth and quality of life.\nThe National Confidential Enquiry into Peri-operative\nDeaths shows that such deaths are commonly associated\nwith cardiac complications [1,2]. Putative contributory\nfactors include a lack of High Dependency Unit (HDU)\nand Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, and suboptimal pre-\nand post-operative ward care. The Department of\nHealth's report \"Comprehensive Critical Care\" [3] pro-\nposed that an HDU facility should care for frail patients\nwho require monitoring or specialised analgesia after sur-\ngery without the immediate availability of medical staff,\nwhereas an ICU-based HDU facility should care for\npatients requiring more detailed observation or interven-\ntion, including immediate availability of experienced\nmedical staff. This simple system offers much to be com-\nmended as an attempt to allow more cost-effective and\nflexible utilisation of critical care services. However, there\nhas been little research on the effects of ICU care alone\non outcome from major surgery and these guidelines are\nbased on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence.\nFurther, they have not been routinely adopted and imple-\nmented into current clinical practice; only around 60% of\nhospitals have ward-based surgical HDU facilities and\n* Correspondence: brian.cuthbertson@sunnybrook.ca\n1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, \nToronto, Ontario, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Cuthbertson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Trials 2010, 11:41\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/41\nPage 2 of 7fewer hospitals have ICU-based HDU facilities [1,2].\n\"Comprehensive Critical Care\" [4] also identified a need\nfor a greater evidence-base to justify the huge clinical\nresources that are currently invested in critical care ser-\nvices throughout the UK. The question remains whether\nroutine ICU-based postoperative care improves out-\ncomes after major surgery in a cost-effective manner.\nThere is also evidence that peri-operative risk can be\nreduced by specific interventions applied before surgery.\nPre-operative optimisation and supranormalisation aims\nto 'optimise' cardiac index and oxygen delivery through a\npre-operative fluid and inotrope strategy that is main-\ntained in the intra-operative and early post-operative\nperiods [5-7]. Early randomised studies suggested a sig-\nnificant outcome advantage from this strategy. Wilson et\nal [6] found a mortality of 17% in the control group com-\npared to 3% in the treatment group and claimed that this\nrepresented a cost-effective improvement in peri-opera-\ntive care [6]. This study has, however, been criticised\nbecause of the poor outcome in the control group.\nAmongst those who consider pre-operative optimisation\nand supranormalisation to be effective, there is debate as\nto which aspect of the strategy brings about the reduction\nin mortality. Furthermore, the practicality of 'full' pre-\noperative optimisation and supranormalisation is limited\nbecause ICU-based care is required both before and after\nsurgery. This has led to consideration of whether compo-\nnents that could be applied outside an ICU setting might\nstill be useful.\nThis proposal is for a randomised controlled trial to test\ntwo of the most promising (but controversial) aspects of\nperi-operative care: firstly, a simple and practical\napproach to pre-operative preparation using ward-based\nintravenous fluid therapy; and secondly, the routine pro-\nvision of intensive care facilities after surgery. We aimed\nto test whether ward-based pre-operative fluid loading\nand post-operative higher levels of dependency are effec-\ntive and cost-effective in high-risk surgical patients\nundergoing major elective and urgent surgery.\nMethods\/Design\nA multi-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial\nwith a partial 2 * 2 factorial design conducted in three UK\nhospitals, coordinated from the Centre for Healthcare\nRandomised Trials (CHaRT) in the Health Services\nResearch Unit, University of Aberdeen [8,9]. The design\nfeatures and estimates used in this protocol were further\ninformed by the results of a 15-week pilot of the proposed\nprotocol undertaken in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, during\nwhich 23 patients were recruited.\nResearch question\nThis trial aims to address the question whether: 1) ward-\nbased pre-operative fluid optimisation and\/or 2) routine\npost-operative ICU-based care for high risk surgical\npatients undergoing major elective and urgent surgery\nimproves outcome and is cost-effective.\nInterventions to be evaluated\nPatients will be randomised to a) pre-operative or stan-\ndard regimen; and then secondly to b) ICU or HDU for\npost-operative care. The partial nature of the factorial\ndesign recognises that some patients may not be able to\nbe randomised to the ICU or HDU comparison (as ICU\nbeds cannot always be guaranteed).\nPre-operative fluid therapy or standard regimen\nIn the pre-operative fluid therapy group patients will be\nelectively commenced on pre-operative fluid therapy (25\nml\/kg) using Hartmann's solution over six hours before\nsurgery in the ward setting. In the standard fluid regimen\nno routine pre-operative fluid therapy will be given. All\npatients receiving bowel preparation will be given an\nadditional 10 ml\/kg Hartmann's solution in the 12 hours\nbefore surgery irrespective of trial group allocation (as\nthis is deemed to be best clinical practice). Patients\nreceiving \"Klean-prep\" bowel preparation with 4 litres of\noral fluid will not receive additional IV fluids.\nICU or HDU for post-operative care\nThe ICU care group will have initial post-operative care\nundertaken in the ICU under the care of ICU clinicians\n[3]. The HDU care group will have initial post-operative\ncare undertaken in a surgical HDU under the care of the\nsurgical team [3].\nAll non-protocol fluid prescriptions and other manage-\nment decisions (including the movement of the patients\nthrough differing levels of dependency) will be made by\nthe clinically responsible medical staff.\nInclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria include patients undergoing major elec-\ntive and urgent abdominal and thoraco-abdominal sur-\ngery who fulfil high-risk surgical criteria [10] who have\nsigned informed consent. These high risk criteria include\nhigh risk type of surgery, presence of ischaemic heart dis-\nease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cere-\nbrovascular disease, insulin therapy for diabetes and pre-\noperative serum creatinine > 2 mg\/dl. Patients who\nundergo open, laparoscopic or laparoscopically-assisted\nsurgery will be eligible.\nExclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria will include New York Heart Associa-\ntion grade IV heart failure; clinician concern about safety\nof interventions; emergency surgery; chronic renal fail-\nure\/creatinine > 300 umol.L-1, lack of informed consent;\nage < 16 years; pregnancy; major hepatic surgery,\nexpected survival < 6 months.\nCuthbertson et al. Trials 2010, 11:41\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/41\nPage 3 of 7Study participants\nParticipants will be recruited from the elective operating\nschedules in the recruiting hospitals and informed con-\nsent obtained. Patients will, in general, be identified fol-\nlowing a pre-assessment visit at a local hospital or\nfollowing their initial appointment with the surgeon.\nThey will be sent an information leaflet prior to their hos-\npital admission, or given one at their appointment.\nInformed consent will be sought from these patients on\ntheir admission to hospital. Participants will be ran-\ndomised through an interactive voice response (IVR)\nautomated telephone randomisation service. A minimisa-\ntion algorithm will be used, incorporating centre, age, sex\nand type of surgery [11]. All participants will be followed\nup daily for one week for major morbidity and mortality,\nthen at hospital discharge and then one, three and six\nmonths after surgery for survival and quality of life.\nOutcome measure\na) Pre-operative fluid therapy or standard regimen\nThe primary outcomes outcome is the number of hospi-\ntal days after surgery (length of stay).\nb) Routine ICU or HDU for post-operative care [3]\nThe primary outcome is cost-effectiveness at six months,\nmeasured by the Net Benefit statistic which is calculated\nusing the following equation: ((\u03bb * QALY) - costs) where \u03bb\nindicates society's 'willingness to pay' (\u03bb is typically set at\n\u00a320,000 and this value will be used for the main analysis);\nQALYs are calculated using EQ-5D scores and costs\ninclude both primary and secondary care costs.\nFor both comparisons, secondary outcomes include\nmeasures of health status at one month after surgery\nmeasured using SF-36 by patient completed survey\n[12,13](with appropriate adjustment to accommodate for\npatients who die); changes in health status and quality of\nlife over 6 months after surgery and quality of life at 48\nhours, three and six months after surgery measured using\nSF-36 [12,13] and EQ-5D [14]; QALY calculated using\nEQ-5D. Other secondary measures include measures of\nhealth care costs including full hospital costs (driven by\ncritical care utilisation and hospital length of stay) and\nprimary care costs. Mortality will be measured using\ntime-to-event analysis and the level of major morbidities\nin hospital using Post-Operative Morbidity Survey\n(POMS) [15]. The decision to discharge the patient from\nhospital was made by the caring team with no involve-\nment of the study personnel. Study outcome measured\nduring hospital stay were measured by study personnel\nnot blinded to the intervention. Outcomes measured\nafter hospital discharge were measured by study person-\nnel blinded to the intervention.\nSample size\nAs the smallest number of patients will be available for\nthe comparison of ICU and HDU care (as not all patients\nwill be able to be randomised to this comparison), this\ncomparison drives the sample size calculation. We aim to\nbe able to detect 0.45 standard deviations of a difference\nin the primary outcome (mean Net Benefit Statistic)\nbetween the two groups. For example, if the standard\ndeviation of Net Benefits in both groups was about\n\u00a310,000, this would equate to being able to detect a differ-\nence in the mean Net Benefit of \u00a34,500. To be able to\ndetect this level of difference with 80% power and a 5%\nlevel of significance, we will recruit 156 patients to this\ncomparison. We further estimate that around 10% of\npatients will not have data available on all components of\nthe cost-effectiveness at six months (which include data\nwhich is self-reported) and as such have inflated the\nnumber required to be recruited to this comparison to\n174.\nIn the pilot study we found a 10% failure rate to prog-\nress from the first randomisation (pre-operative fluid) to\nthe second randomisation (ICU versus HDU) because\nICU care was not available. As such, the total sample size\nrequired to be recruited to the comparison of pre-opera-\ntive fluid therapy or standard management needs to be at\nleast 10% greater than that being sought for the ICU\/\nHDU comparison. Conservatively, we have assumed that\n15% will not be able to be randomised to the ICU\/HDU\nrandomisation and thus estimate that 204 patients be\nrecruited to the study in total.\nWe have no reason to expect any loss to follow up for\nthe primary outcome of the pre-operative fluid compari-\nson (as the primary outcome is number of days in hospi-\ntal after surgery). Ideally this comparison would have\nsufficient power to detect a 0.5 standard deviation change\nin number of days in hospital, with 80% power and 5%\nsignificance (requiring data on 128 patients to be avail-\nable for analysis). In fact, a total sample size of 204\npatients would allow a difference of 0.4 standard devia-\ntions of a difference to be detected with at least 80%\npower at a 5% level of significance (and over 90% power\nto detect a 0.5 standard deviation difference). The trial\npatient pathway is presented in figure 1.\nThe study would also have approximately 90% power to\naddress the health related quality of life secondary out-\ncomes. Previous quality of life studies suggest a difference\nin means of 0.5 of a standard deviation in Health Related\nQuality of Life scores reflects a clinically important\nchange. The pilot study indicated that such a difference\nwould translate to around five points in the mean physi-\ncal component score of the SF-36 questionnaire.\nTrial management\nThe pilot study suggested that non-compliance with the\nproposed protocol will be uncommon. Nevertheless, we\nrecognise that ICUs must have the ability to discharge\ntrial patients early according to clinical need; this will be\nCuthbertson et al.

Weekly progress meetings will be held in each\nclinical centre and at the study Data Centre at CHaRT.\nThe applicants will form a Trial Management Group,\nwhich will meet monthly. CHaRT will also perform\ndetailed and regular site reviews and visits to ensure\nrecruitment. If they are not achieved then they will\nundertake further actions to remedy this as required. The\ntrial will be supervised by a Trial Steering Committee\nwith an independent Chair. This Committee will oversee\nthe trial and monitor progress against the milestones. An\nindependent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will,\nduring the period of recruitment to the trial, be provided\nwith interim analyses, in strict confidence, together with\nany other analyses that the committee may request. The\nfrequency of any interim analyses will be based on the\njudgement of this Committee.\nData analysis\nThe statistical analyses will be based on all people ran-\ndomised who are retained in the study until the primary\noutcome time points, irrespective of subsequent compli-\nance to treatment allocation. The principal comparisons\nwill be a) all patients randomised to fluid optimisation\nversus all patients not allocated fluid optimisation and b)\nall patients randomised to routine ICU care versus all\npatients randomised to HDU for post-operative care.\nFigure 1 Trial patient pathway.\n \n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIdentification of high risk major \nsurgical patients n = 300 (100%) \nFirst randomisation group \nallocation n = 204 (67%) \nFluid loading n = 102 No fluid loading n = 102 \nOperating theatre n = 204 \nICU care n = 87 HDU care n = 87 \nWard care n = 204 \nNo ICU bed available n = 30 \nHospital discharge n = 204 \n6 month follow up n = 156 \nCuthbertson et al.

All statistical analyses\nwill be pre-specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan which\nwill be agreed before any unblinded data is seen. Length\nof stay will be analysed using linear regression adjusted\nfor the minimisation variables [11]. For the net benefit\nstatistic, linear regression will also be used with adjust-\nment for minimisation variables and the baseline EQ-5D\nscore. Bootstrapping of the confidence interval for the\nmean difference in net-benefit will be performed and sta-\ntistical significance determined on the basic of this inter-\nval including zero. Further details on the generation of\nthe components of the net-benefit statistic are given in\nthe economic analysis section. Health related quality of\nlife measure will be analysed similarly. Mortality will be\nanalysed using a Cox-proportional hazards model\nadjusted for minimisation factors. POMS will be analysed\nusing logistic regression adjusted for minimisation cova-\nriates. A two-sided 5% significance level will be applied as\nevidence of statistical significance for the analyses. Corre-\nsponding confidence intervals will be presented.\nFor the fluid randomisation we plan to include patients\nrecruited into the pilot study within the analysis as they\nhave undergone the same interventions and have the\nsame outcome measures collected (hospital length of\nstay). Pilot study data will not be used in the analysis of\nICU length of stay as the primary outcome time point\nwas changed from 1 year to 6 months as a result of the\npilot.\nA single principal analysis is planned six months after\nthe last person is recruited. If considered appropriate, fol-\nlow-up of recruits will be extended at this time and a cor-\nresponding latter analysis will also be conducted once the\nlatter follow-up data is available. Secondary subgroup\nanalyses will be investigated through tests for interaction\nand will include patients with co-morbidities, cardiac risk\n[11], urgency and type of surgery. Stricter levels of statis-\ntical significance (2-sided 1% significance level) will be\napplied reflecting the exploratory nature of these sub-\ngroup analyses.\nEconomic analysis\nBased on experience gained through the pilot study, costs\nto the NHS will be elicited using a \"top-down\" method.\nResource data will be collected on hospital costs by\npatient follow up, case note review and through the\nPatient Admissions System. The main drivers of hospital\ncosts will be critical care utilisation and hospital length of\nstay. Primary care resource utilisation, patient costs and\ncosts to carers will be identified by telephone interview.\nNHS resource usage will be costed using appropriate unit\ncosts. Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year will\nbe calculated using data elicited from the EQ-5D ques-\ntionnaire. For patients who die, a quality of life score of\nzero will be applied for measurements after death\n[14,16,17]. Uncertainty will be explored using both sto-\nchastic (which will utilise the net benefits data) and other\nforms of sensitivity analysis [17]. The stochastic analysis\nwill explore the impact of using different values for soci-\nety's willingness to pay for a QALY (\u03bb) and these data will\nbe presented in the form of a cost-effectiveness accept-\nability curve. Sensitivity analysis will also be used to\nexplore the impact of imputing any missing data.\nEthics approval\nThe Multicentre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland\nhas approved the study for the UK (Ref 04\/MRE10\/76).)\nThe trial has been registered in a public trials registry\n(registry number ISRCTN32188676). The trial will be\nconducted according to the principles of good practice\nprovided by Research Governance Guidelines and the\nData Protection Act 1998. The trial is sponsored by the\nUniversity of Aberdeen. The Trial Management Group,\nthrough the Trial Steering Committee, will ensure that\nadequate systems are in place for monitoring the quality\nof the study (compliance with Good Clinical Practice\n(GCP)) and appropriate expedited (when appropriate)\nand routine reports of adverse effects.\nDiscussion\nIt is clear from the existing evidence based that there is a\nlack of evidence to guide clinicians and health service\nmanagers on the optimal peri-operative management of\nhigh risk patients. This group of patients has very signifi-\ncant morbidity and mortality and strategies need to be\nidentified to improve these outcomes. We are conducting\nthis randomised controlled trial to attempt to answer two\nimportant research questions in this patient group which\nwill supply highly useful evidence on the optimal man-\nagement in this group and help guide clinicians as well as\nhealth service managers in their prioritisation and deci-\nsion making.\nAuthor's information\nBHC is an intensive care clinician and clinical researcher\nand trialist at the Department of Critical Care Medicine,\nSunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada and holds the status of honorary Professor at the\nUniversity of Aberdeen.
