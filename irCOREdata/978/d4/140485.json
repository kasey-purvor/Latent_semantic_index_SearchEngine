Box 4955, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania \n2Department of Water Management, Silsoe College, Cranfield University, Silsoe, \nBedfordshire, MK45 4DT, U.K. \n \nSUMMARY \nThe physiological basis for differences in yields from well-watered and droughted plants \nof four contrasting clones of tea were studied in terms of light interception, dry matter \nproduction and partitioning at a high altitude site in Southern Tanzania where there are \nmarked seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature.  The plant dry weights, including \nroots, were measured eight months after field planting and subsequently at intervals of \nthree to four months, corresponding to the different seasons, during the following two \nyears.  Fully irrigated plants of one clone (S15\/10) were also harvested after four years in \nthe field. Clones differed in the rates of canopy spread and hence in their capacity to \nintercept solar radiation.  The \u2018radiation use efficiency\u2019 (the net total dry matter production \nper unit of intercepted short-wave solar radiation) was similar for the four well-watered \nclones and ranged from 0.40 to 0.66 g MJ\n-1\n, which corresponds closely to values reported \nfor other woody tropical plants.  A 16-week drought treatment imposed two years after \nplanting reduced the mean light interception of the four clones by about 25% and the mean \nradiation use efficiency by 78% to 0.09 g MJ\n-1\n.  Clone S15\/10, a cultivar from Kenya \nwhich produces large yields, partitioned a greater proportion of dry matter to leaves and \nharvested shoots than the other clones, and correspondingly less to large structural roots.  \nThis resulted in a maximum harvest index of 24%, substantially greater than other values \nreported in the literature.  There were seasonal differences in partitioning with more dry \nmatter being diverted to roots and less to shoots during the cool season.  Although the \ndrought treatments had no significant effect on root growth, the amount of dry matter \npartitioned to leaves, stems and harvested shoots declined by 80-95%.  The roots of all \nfour clones extended in depth at similar rates (about 2 mm d\n-1\n), those of Clone S15\/10 \nreaching 2.8 m after four years.  The results are discussed in terms of appropriate field \ncultural practices and possible selection criteria for high yielding clones. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe yield (Y; g m-2) of a crop can be expressed by: \n                                           Y = S . fS . \u03b5S. HI                                                                (1) \n                                                 \n2Address for correspondence:: Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, MK43 0AL \n(P.Burgess@cranfield.ac.uk) \n \n2 \nwhere S is the short-wave solar radiation (MJ m-2) incident during the measurement \nperiod, fS is the proportion of this radiation intercepted by the crop canopy, \u03b5S is the ratio \nof total dry matter production to intercepted radiation, or radiation use efficiency (g MJ-1), \nand HI is the harvest index, or that proportion of the total dry matter which forms the \neconomic yield.  Extensive studies of dry matter production and partitioning have been \nmade on many annual crops, but similar research on perennial crops is limited.  Corley \n(1983) has reported that the annual above ground dry matter production of crops such as \ncocoa, oil palm, coconut and rubber is between 20 and 29 t ha-1.  Assuming complete \ninterception of annual short-wave radiation receipts of 6000 to 7500 MJ m-2 for the \ntropics, this is equivalent to a radiation use efficiency for above-ground dry matter of 0.27-\n0.48 g MJ-1.  By contrast Magambo and Cannell (1981) found that the annual dry matter \nproduction of harvested tea (Clone 6\/8) with complete canopy cover grown at an altitude \nof 2178 m in Kenya was only 16.9 and 12.7 t ha-1, with and without roots respectively.  \nUsing the same figures for annual short-wave radiation of 6000-7500 MJ m-2, the values \nfor \u03b5S of 0.22-0.28 g MJ-1 including roots (or 0.17-0.21 g MJ-1 without roots) are less than \nthose estimated for other tropical perennial crops. \n The productivity of tea is also limited by a low harvest index (Squire, 1985).  The \neconomic yield, which comprises shoots with a terminal bud and up to three unfurled \nleaves, can be increased by harvesting shoots with more leaves, but this reduces the \nquality and value of the processed product (Cloughley et al., 1983).  The harvest index can \nalso be increased through clonal selection: for example Murty and Sharma (1986) reported \nindices of 7 and 16% for two tea clones in Southern India. \n The yield development of six contrasting clones from Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania \nunder a range of drought regimes have been described in Part I of this series (Burgess and \nCarr, 1996a).  During the second year after planting harvested yields of dry tea under well \nwatered conditions ranged from 2320-2510 kg ha-1 for Clones 1, 6\/8 and SFS150 to 3590 \nkg ha-1 for Clone S15\/10.  This paper reports an investigation into the physiological basis \nof these clonal differences using the framework summarised by Equation 1, the overall \naim being to quantify how the different parameters vary in their responses to drought and \ntemperature, so that possible selection criterion might be identified. \n \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nSite and climate \n The Ngwazi Tea Research Unit (8\u00b032'S, 35\u00b010'E, altitude 1840 m) is situated next to \nthe 500 ha fresh water Lake Ngwazi in the Mufindi District of the Southern Highlands of \nTanzania.  The year can be divided into three main seasons on the basis of rainfall and \ntemperature.  Over 95% of the 800-1100 mm annual rainfall occurs during the warm-wet \nseason from the end of November to May, when the monthly mean air temperature (Tmean) \nis 16-19\u00b0C.  The dry season can be divided into two: being cool (13-16\u00b0C) from June to \nAugust and warm (16-19\u00b0C) from September to November.  The annual incident short-\nwave radiation (S), measured using a Gunn Bellani pyranometer which was calibrated \nagainst a Kipp solarimeter in 1989, varies from 5950 to 6400 MJ m-2.  Mean daily values \nare at a maximum (23 MJ m-2) in October when it is dry and at a minimum (15 MJ m-2) \nduring the rainy season from November to May when there is substantial cloud (Figure 1). \n A gently sloping (< 3%) area close the lake and adjacent to an area of mature tea was \nselected as an experimental site.  The soil is a Xanthic ferralsol with the particle size \ndistribution of a sandy clay above 0.15 m and that of a clay below.  Despite the high \nproportion of clay the soil remains friable because of the low effective cation exchange \n3 \ncapacity (< 16 mmol 100g-1 of clay).  The available water content held at matric potentials \nbetween -10 kPa and -1500 kPa ranges from 110 to 122 mm m-1 in the top 2 m of soil. \n \n \nFigure 1.   Measured mean daily total short-wave solar radiation at Ngwazi Tea Research \nUnit from August 1988 to October 1992. \n \nExperimental treatments \n Dry matter production and partitioning were studied in four contrasting tea clones of \ncommercial and\/or scientific importance in eastern Africa.  These ranged from small-leaf \nClone 1, to intermediate-leaf Clone 6\/8 and large-leaf Clones SFS150 and S15\/10.  Clone \nS15\/10, selected by the African Highlands Produce Company Ltd in Kericho, Kenya, \nproduces the highest yield of the four clones under well-watered conditions (Burgess and \nCarr, 1996a), but when droughted the yield can be similar to those from Clones 1 and \nSFS150.  Clone 1, selected in Tanzania, has a large shoot population density (Stephens \nand Carr, 1990), but the small fibrous shoots can be difficult to harvest by hand.  It also \nhas a high base temperature for shoot extension which results in small yields during the \ncool part of the dry season (Burgess and Carr, 1996b).  By contrast Clone SFS150 (from \nMalawi) has a low base temperature for extension and as a consequence it produces \nrelatively large yields at this time.  Despite these contrasting responses to temperature \nClones 1 and SFS150 have produced the same annual yields.  Clone 6\/8 is a high quality \nclone from Kenya which produces similar yields to Clones 1 and SFS150 when irrigated, \nbut less than these clones when droughted. \n Unreplicated 96 m2 blocks of each of these four clones were planted in August 1988 at \nspacings of 1.2 x 0.8 m at one end of the line-source experiment described by Burgess and \nCarr (1996a), so that individual plants could be destructively sampled.  Each clonal block \nwas divided into three sub-plots, parallel to the irrigation lateral, labelled \u2018wet\u2019, \n\u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019.  All of the tea was uniformly irrigated after planting in 1988 and \nduring the initial part of each subsequent dry season.  Differential drought treatments were \nimposed for seven weeks in 1989 (9 October to 27 November) and for sixteen weeks in \n1990 (27 July to 18 November), when the plants in the \u2018wet\u2019 sub-plots continued to \nreceive their full water requirements, those in the \u2018dry\u2019 sub-plots received no irrigation \nwater and those in the \u2018intermediate\u2019 treatment were partially irrigated. \n \n4 \nCrop management \n The crop was mulched with Napier grass (Pennisetum pupureum) at planting in August \n1988 and again in April 1989, and with Guatemala grass (Tripsacum laxum) in October \n1990.  Fertiliser rates were set to minimise nutrient deficiency and have been fully \ndescribed in Paper I (Burgess and Carr, 1996a).  The tea was brought into production by \nspreading the young branches and then \u2018pegging\u2019 them into position at intervals between \nApril and October 1989.  Shoots above a height of 0.45 m from the ground were removed \nin early November 1989, 15 months after planting, to produce a level plucking surface.  \nThe first routine harvest (in which protruding shoots, with two or more unfurled leaves or \nthose with dormant buds, were removed by hand) followed one month later and \nsubsequently at 13-15 day intervals extending up to 24 days during the cool seasons. \n \nPlant harvests \n During 1989 and 1990 whole plants, including roots, were harvested at the end of the \nrains in April\/May, the end of the cool-dry season in August\/September and the end of the \nwarm-dry season in November\/December (Table 1).  One plant of each of Clones 1, 6\/8, \nSFS150 and S15\/10 was harvested from each of the \u2018wet\u2019, \u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 sub-\nplots for the first time in April 1989, six months before the imposition of drought \ntreatments.  For the next four harvests from August 1989 (also before differential \nirrigation began) to August 1990 one plant from each of the four clones was selected from \nthe \u2018wet\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 sub-plots only.  In November 1990, to improve the precision of \nmeasurement, three plants of each clone were selected from the \u2018wet\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 sub-plots.  \nIn September 1992, four years after field planting, a further three plants of fully irrigated \nClone S15\/10 were harvested.  The sampled plants were always surrounded on each side \nby bushes of the same clone and age, and from December 1989 the selected plants had the \nmedian ground cover of a pre-determined group of ten adjacent plants.  The periods \nbetween harvests and the corresponding maximum actual soil water deficits in the selected \ndrought treatments are shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1.  The dates of plant harvests, the corresponding seasons, mean air temperatures \n(\u00b0C), and maximum actual soil water deficits (SWD; mm) within each drought treatment \nfor each of six sample periods. \nSample Dates of harvests    Season and mean air  Maximum SWD \nperiod            temperature       Drought treatment \n    wet intermediate dry \n 1 15 Apr 89   -    6 Aug 89 Cool-dry 15.0 45 45 45 \n 2 6 Aug 89  -   12 Dec 89 Warm-dry 16.9 58 - 84 \n 3 12 Dec 89 -    5 May 90 Warm-wet 18.3 30 - 30 \n 4 5 May 90  -  15 Aug 90 Cool-dry 14.7 45 - 70 \n 5 15 Aug 90  -  26 Nov 90 Warm-dry 16.8 46 - 117 \n 6 26 Nov 90  -  22 Sept 92 - 16.9 60 - - \n \n \n The canopy of each harvested plant was separated into woody stem, green stem and \nleaves.  To retrieve the roots an area centred on the base of the plant corresponding to the \nplant spacing (0.8 x 1.2 m) was excavated beyond the maximum rooting depth.  The \nexcavated soil was sieved through a 10 mm2 wire mesh to remove the fine soil particles, \nbefore being sorted over a second sieve where the roots were removed by hand and \nclassified visually as being either thick (diameter greater than 1 mm) or fine (diameter less \nthan 1 mm).  The roots, stems and leaves of each plant were then oven dried at 85-90\u00b0C \n5 \nfor 48 hours, or until there was no further loss in mass.  When the volume of a plant \ncomponent was too large for the oven, the dry mass was estimated from the total fresh \nmass and the mean dry\/fresh mass ratio of two to four randomly selected samples \n(range: 30-240 g). \n The dry mass of shoots harvested from each bush was estimated using the yields \nobtained from the corresponding treatments within the adjacent main experiment (Burgess \nand Carr, 1996a).  In both November 1990 and September 1992 the dry mass of dead \nleaves which had collected at the base of each plant was also included in the estimate of \ntotal dry matter production.  For the first harvest it was possible to complete everything \nwithin three days.  The harvest starting in November 1990 (24 plants) took a total of 38 \ndays, with root excavation, separation and weighing taking a further 18 days.  To minimise \npossible confounding effects of changes in plant weight during this time, one plant was \nharvested within each treatment before proceeding to a second and a third replicate block.  \nThe reported harvest date was taken as that midway between the start and end of the \nharvesting period.  The final harvest of three plants in September 1992, including roots to \ndepths of 2.8 m, took 29 days. \n \nLight interception \n From December 1989 to September 1992 the crop cover of each harvested plant was \nmeasured using a 1.2 x 0.8 m grid, divided into 0.1 x 0.1 m squares, held horizontally \nabove the bush.  The proportion of each square (0-25, 25-75 or 75-100%) which included \nleaf, when examined individually from overhead, was recorded to provide an estimate of \nthe ground covered by each plant.  The total quantity of light intercepted by the plants \nbetween harvests (S. fS; MJ m-2) within selected treatments was then calculated using \nEquation 2 (Jackson and Palmer, 1979).  \n    S. fS.  = S. C. (1 - e -k LAI') (2) \nwhere S is the total incident short-wave solar radiation (MJ m-2), C is the mean proportion \nof ground covered by the crop, k is the light extinction coefficient within the bush canopy \nand LAI' is the mean leaf area per unit area of crop cover.  Measurements using a \nDecagon ceptometer (Delta-T Devices) on four contrasting clones, including Clones 6\/8 \nand S15\/10, in Kenya indicated a consistent extinction coefficient of 0.6 for \nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a canopy of young tea (Ng\u2019etich, 1995).  In \nthe absence of other information, the same value of k was assumed for short-wave \nradiation.  The total leaf area of each plant was determined by measuring each leaf with a \ncalibrated card (Pethiyagoda and Ragendram, 1965).  For the last three harvests, leaf areas \nwere calculated from the total fresh mass of leaf multiplied by the mean leaf area\/fresh \nmass ratio determined from three randomly selected 100 g samples. \n \n \nRESULTS \nLight interception \n The mean daily interception of solar radiation by the four fully irrigated clones \nincreased from 3.8 MJ m-2 during the 1989\/90 warm-wet season (16 to 21 months after \nfield planting) to 9.4 MJ m-2 during the 1990 warm-dry season (24 to 27 months after \nplanting) (Table 2).  This was primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of \nintercepted radiation (fS) from 25 to 45%, caused by an expansion in the crop cover (C) \nfrom 27 to 48%.  Throughout this period the mean values of LAI' ranged from 4.7 to 5.1. \n \n6 \nTable 2.

These values of LAI' corresponded with visual observations that fully irrigated \nClone 6\/8 had a more upright and dense canopy than Clone S15\/10.  During the same \nperiod, the mean solar radiation intercepted by plants within the droughted treatments was \n26% lower than that within the fully irrigated plots, mainly caused by a restriction of crop \ncover development.  The observation that Clone 6\/8 was particularly prone to defoliation \nwhen water stressed was substantiated by a reduction in the value of LAI\u2019 to 4.8 in the \ndroughted plots, similar to the values for the other clones (4.1-5.1). \n \n \nTable 3.

By November 1990, the net dry matter \nproduced by the same clones had increased to a mean of 1165 \u00b1 59 g for the fully irrigated \nplants (Table 4), with values ranging from a low of 1060 g for Clone 6\/8 to a high of \n1275 g for Clone 1, a difference which was not statistically significant (P=0.05).  By \nSeptember 1992, 49 months after field planting, the mean net dry matter produced by a \nfully irrigated Clone S15\/10 plant had reached 4770 \u00b1 597 g. \n The mean daily growth rate of the four clones increased from 0.4 g plant-1 between \nApril and August 1989, to 3.6 g plant-1 from August to November 1990, and to \n5.4 g plant-1 for fully irrigated Clone S15\/10 between November 1990 and September \n1992.  These differences were associated with an increase in light interception from 3.8 to \n13.6 MJ m-2 d-1 rather than changes in the radiation use efficiency which was usually in \nthe range of 0.40 to 0.46 g MJ-1, except during the warm-wet season from December 1989 \nto May 1990 when it was as high as 0.66 g MJ-1.  It is not possible to assess whether this \ndifference was related to the quite small changes in the mid-afternoon vapour pressure \ndeficit of the air between the warm-wet (0.7-0.9 kPa) and warm-dry months (0.9-1.5 kPa) \nalthough this could have been the case.  There were no consistent differences between the \nradiation use efficiency of the four clones within the well-watered treatments. \n \nTable 4.

However \nthree months later, immediately following the second period of drought, the mean dry \nmass of the fully irrigated plants had increased by 47% to 1165 g, whereas that of the \ndroughted plants had risen by only 13% to 804 g (Table 5).  The reduced daily growth rate \nof the unirrigated plants was associated with a 26% decrease in the amount of intercepted \n8 \nlight from 9.3 to 6.9 MJ m-2 d-1, and a 78% reduction in radiation use efficiency from 0.40 \nto 0.09 g MJ-1.  There were also indications of differences between clones in the drought \nsensitivity of the radiation use efficiency index (P\u22640.05), with Clone 6\/8 being more \nsusceptible to water stress than Clones 1 and SFS150. \n \nTable 5.

The mean daily increment in the dry mass of shoots harvested from \nfully irrigated Clone S15\/10 (0.50 g plant-1) was greater (P\u22640.01) than those from Clones \n1, 6\/8 and SFS150 (0.32-0.38 g plant-1) (Table 6a).  These values are equivalent to dried \ntea yields of 1940 and 1210-1440 kg ha-1respectively. \n \n \n9 \n \n \nFigure 2.  Changes in (a) the rate of dry matter production and (b) the partitioning of that \ndry matter to harvested shoots, leaves, stems and roots, averaged for all four well-watered \nclones (1, 6\/8, SFS150 and S15\/10) in each of five seasons from April 1989 to November \n1990. \n \n \n Although the high yields from Clone S15\/10 were partly a result of a large total dry \nmatter production, the harvest index of this clone reached 16%, between December 1989 \nand November 1990, compared to 11-15% for the other three clones.  In addition Clone \nS15\/10 partitioned a greater proportion of dry matter to leaves (29%) and green stem (8%) \nthan Clones 1, 6\/8 and SFS150 (Figure 3).  By contrast only 11% of its dry matter was \npartitioned to thick structural roots compared to 23-29% for the other clones.  There were \nno significant differences between clones in the amount of dry matter partitioned to woody \nstems, or to fine roots.  During the 22 months from November 1990 to September 1992, \nthe daily yield increment from fully irrigated Clone S15\/10 increased to 1.31 g plant-1 \n(equivalent to an annual yield of about 5000 kg dried tea ha-1) and the harvest index \nreached a value of 24% (Table 6b).   \n \n  \n10 \n \nFigure 3.

In November 1990, 27 months after planting, the \n11 \nmean maximum rooting depth of this clone (1.46 m) was intermediate between those of \nClones 1 (1.37 m) and 6\/8 (1.66 m); these values were not significantly different (P=0.05).  \nAssuming that Clone S15\/10 was representative of the four clones the mean increase in \nmaximum rooting depth, from the end of the first year to the fourth year after planting, \nappeared to be consistent ranging from 2.1 \u00b1 0.12 mm d-1 (df = 26, R2 = 92%), from \nAugust 1989 to November 1990, to 2.0 \u00b1 0.11 mm d-1 (df = 4, R2 = 99%) from November \n1990 to September 1992 (Figure 4).  By then the maximum rooting depth of Clone S15\/10, \nfour years after field planting, had reached 2.8 m. \n \n \nFigure 4.  Increase in the mean maximum rooting depth of four irrigated clones (1, 6\/8, \nSFS150 and S15\/10) with time from field planting in August 1988 to November 1990 and \nfor Clone S15\/10 (U) only until September 1992.  The slopes of the fitted lines are 2.10 \u00b1 \n0.116 mm d-1 between August 1989 and November 1990 (all clones), and 2.00 \u00b1 0.112 \nmm d-1 from November 1990 to September 1992 (Clone S15\/10). \n \n In November 1990, although drought treatments had been imposed during the \npreceding 16 weeks, the maximum root depths of the four clones in the \u2018dry\u2019 plots were \nsimilar to those in the \u2018wet\u2019 treatments.  The relative insensitivity of root growth to \ndrought was also demonstrated by the observation that droughted bushes partitioned a \nsimilar amount of dry matter to roots as the well-watered plants (Table 7).  Because the net \nproduction of total dry matter was reduced by drought, the proportion of the total that was \npartitioned to roots increased from 21% in the \u2018wet\u2019 plots, to 65% where the plants were \ndroughted.  By contrast drought substantially reduced both the amount and the proportion \nof dry matter partitioned to leaves, stems and harvested shoots.  For example: the amount \nof dry matter partitioned to above-ground components declined by between 80 and 95%, \nwith the result that the harvest index fell from a mean value of 17% in the \u2018wet\u2019 treatments \nto only 8% in the \u2018dry\u2019 plots. \n \n12 \nTable 7.

The practical opportunities which \nexist to identify new high yielding clones and the need to modify cultural practices to \nexploit these relations are also considered. \n \nLight interception \n The use of Jackson and Palmer's (1979) model for light interception in a discontinuous \ncanopy highlighted the importance of crop cover, relative to the values of LAI\u2019 and k, in \ndetermining the solar radiation intercepted by young tea.  Since the normal growth habit of \na tea bush is upright, the leaf area index tends to be high within the canopy.  Even at the \nlowest calculated value for LAI\u2019 of 4.1, the tea plants intercepted 91% of the incident light \nwithin the area of the bush.  Because additional leaf growth at the centre of the bush leads \nto greater shading of the existing leaves, increased light interception in young tea at a \nfixed spacing depends primarily on promoting the lateral spread of the bush.  Tea growers \nhave developed many practical ways of doing this including pruning and \u2018pegging\u2019. \n Although the tea bushes in this experiment were pegged during 1989, there were still \nimportant clonal differences in light interception.  For example Clone S15\/10, which tends \nto spread naturally was able to intercept more solar radiation than Clone 6\/8 (which has a \nmore erect habit) and this characteristic can explain, in part, the particularly large yields \nobtained from Clone S15\/10 during the initial three years of this experiment (Burgess and \nCarr, 1996a).  The capacity of a clone to establish rapid full-crop cover is also beneficial \nbecause it minimises weed growth and soil erosion, and encourages the build-up of leaf \nlitter beneath the canopy. \n The results also highlight the importance of minimising water stress to maximise light \ninterception by young tea plants.  Whereas mature bushes of some clones may be able to \nmaintain a full crop canopy after six months without rain or irrigation (Stephens and Carr, \n1991), the young plants in this experiment showed a mean reduction of 26% in light \ninterception during four months of drought.  As reported in Part I (Burgess and Carr, \n1996a), such reductions in canopy cover will reduce yields during the subsequent wet \nseason.  \n \n13 \nRadiation use efficiency \n The observation that there were no consistent differences between the radiation use \nefficiency of the four clones under well-watered conditions corresponds with \nmeasurements made during 1990 (Smith et al., 1994) which showed that the fully \nilluminated leaves of these clones had similar photosynthetic rates (3.96-4.22 \u03bcmol m-2 s-\n1).  Although the same authors reported that a fifth clone, labelled 207, had a low \nphotosynthetic rate (3.35 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) the radiation use efficiency of this clone was not \nmeasured. \n The mean \u03b5S values of 0.40-0.66 g MJ-1 for the four fully irrigated clones are higher \nthan the estimate (0.25 g MJ-1) inferred for six year old harvested Clone 6\/8 grown at high \naltitude (2178 m) in Kenya (Magambo and Cannell, 1981).  Although the mean annual air \ntemperature at Ngwazi (16.7\u00b0C) is marginally higher than that at the Kenyan site (16.2\u00b0C), \nthere are seasonal differences in temperature which may be important.  Secondly although \nit was reported that the plants in Kenya had \u2018complete\u2019 canopy cover, the first \nmeasurements were taken only four months after the bushes had been pruned and during a \nperiod when hail damage occurred.  In such circumstances, it is improbable that light \ninterception was 100% and therefore the actual radiation use efficiency could have been \nhigher than the values indicated.  An additional explanation is that the tea bushes sampled \nin Kenya, which were older and larger than those monitored in Tanzania, had \ncorrespondingly greater respiration losses.   If the level of respiration, relative to \nphotosynthesis, increases as a plant grows (Charles-Edwards, 1982) then this would also \nreduce the value of \u03b5S.  This may also explain the observation that the radiation use \nefficiency fell from 0.66 to 0.42 g MJ-1 over the experimental period described here. \n The possible effects of biases in the reported values of \u03b5S, caused by the selection of \nparticularly large or small plants at the start or the end of each period, were minimised by \nmeasuring at least three plants at each harvest.  A larger sample than this was precluded \nbecause of the limited plot sizes and the need to excavate roots to depths below 1.5 m in \nthe final two harvests.  The precision of the values also depends on the validity of the \nassumption that the turnover of fine roots or the breakdown of leaf litter were minimal.  If \neither of these assumptions is incorrect then \u03b5S will have been underestimated. \n The values of 0.40-0.66 g MJ-1 are similar to those reported for other tropical woody \ncrops such as oil palm (0.70 g MJ-1; Corley et al., 1971 calculated by Squire, 1990).  \nHowever they are lower than those, including roots, for well-watered tropical annual crops \nsuch as groundnut (1.09 g MJ-1; Azam-Ali et al. 1989).  A possible reason for the apparent \nlow radiation use efficiency of tea is that a high proportion, between 67% (Tanton, 1979) \nand 85% (Hadfield, 1974), of the total dry matter produced by photosynthesis is estimated \nto be lost by respiration compared with 30-50%, for example, by a grass crop (Charles-\nEdwards, 1982).  A second explanation, is that the individual leaves of tea bushes have a \nrelatively slow rate of carbon assimilation (Smith et al., 1993).  This could be due partly to \nenvironmental factors, such as the vapour pressure deficit of the air, limiting stomatal \nconductance.  However Squire (1985) and Cannell (1985) have suggested that the removal \nof the shoots which form important sinks for assimilates could also feed back to reduce \nphotosynthetic rates.   \n The values established for the radiation use efficiency of tea in Tanzania are also lower \nthan those for crops, including roots, grown in temperate areas such as sugar beet \n(1.6 g MJ-1; Scott et al., 1994) and willow cuttings (1.58 g MJ-1; Cannell et al., 1987).  \nWhereas canopies in Britain are seldom light saturated for prolonged periods,  the day-\ntime light intensities at the experimental site in Tanzania are often above the level \n(1000 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or about 480 W m-2 total \n14 \nshort-wave radiation) where photosynthetic rates are insensitive to changes in illuminance \n(Smith et al., 1993).  In addition because most leaves of commercially harvested tea are \nconcentrated in a narrow layer near the surface of the canopy, they will tend to be exposed \nto the full intensity of the incident radiation.  By contrast if the same bushes are left \nunharvested for many months an uneven canopy is produced with fewer, but larger \nindividual shoots with erect leaves at the top and horizontal leaves lower down.  Light \npenetration will be deeper within such a canopy and a greater number of leaves will \nintercept light at intensities where photosynthesis per unit of radiation is more efficient \nthan in a conventionally harvested bush.  This may also explain why Magambo and \nCannell (1981) found that dry matter production was less in harvested tea than in \nunharvested plants even though the canopy cover was \u2018complete\u2019 in both cases. \n Whereas the imposition of water stress caused a 26% reduction in light interception \nfrom August to November 1990 (24 to 27 months after planting), the value of \u03b5S was \nreduced by 78%.  This sensitivity of radiation use efficiency to drought is also \nsubstantiated by measurements reported by Smith et al. (1994).  These showed that the \nmean leaf photosynthetic rate (at illuminances greater than 1000 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 PAR) for the \nsame four clones at this time was halved from 4.1 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 in the well-watered \ntreatments to 2.0 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 where the plants were most stressed.   \n There were also indications that the radiation use efficiency of Clone 6\/8 was reduced \nmore by water stress than those of Clones 1 and SFS150.  Although this difference must \nbe treated with caution because of the limited sample size, the results are again supported \nby the observations of Smith et al. (1994) who reported that the mean leaf photosynthetic \nrates for unirrigated plants of Clones 1 and SFS150 (2.1-2.2 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) were 30% \ngreater than those for Clone 6\/8 (1.6 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1).  These differences also correspond \nwith the observation, reported in Part I (Burgess and Carr, 1996a), that the annual yields \nfrom Clones 1 and SFS150 were less sensitive to drought than those of Clone 6\/8.  \n \nDry matter partitioning \nEffects of temperature: dry matter partitioning to harvested shoots and leaves was lower \n(both in absolute and relative terms) during the cool season (Tmean = 14-15\u00b0C), than during \nthe warm months from September to April (Tmean = 16-19\u00b0C).  This corresponds with \nconcurrent measurements reported in Part III (Burgess and Carr, 1996b) which showed \nthat shoot extension rates were closely related to air temperature.  Because net dry matter \nproduction appears to be less sensitive to low temperatures than shoot extension, the \nreduced \u2018demand\u2019 for photosynthates by the shoots at low temperatures results in \nincreased partitioning of dry matter to the roots.  This translocation of photosynthates to \nthe roots during cool weather has also been demonstrated for tea using radio-carbon \ntracing techniques in Assam (Manivel and Hussain, 1982), whilst active root growth \nduring the cool season in Tanzania has been observed in underground root chambers by \nCarr (1971). \n As air temperatures increase the processes are reversed.  High temperatures lead to fast \nshoot extension rates and the resultant \u2018demand\u2019 of the shoots for photosynthates reduces \nthe diversion of assimilates to the roots.  Preferential translocation of dry matter to the \ncanopy after a cool season has also been reported for tea in Malawi (Fordham, 1972; Herd \nand Squire, 1976), which explains, in part, the large peaks in yield observed from irrigated \ntea in Southern Tanzania during October (Stephens and Carr, 1991; Burgess and Carr, \n1996a). \n \nEffects of clone:  in addition to rapid establishment of crop cover, the large initial yields \nfrom Clone S15\/10 resulted from a high harvest index, which was associated with greater \n15 \ndry matter partitioning to other, non-harvested, leaves than for the other three clones.  A \nsimilar positive relationship between the harvest index and the proportion of dry matter \npartitioned to the canopy has been reported by Othieno (1982) in Kenya.  Of particular \ninterest for clonal selection is that this physiological trait was apparent in plants less than \neight months after field planting.  Clonal differences in the proportion of dry mass \npartitioned to the leaves of young tea plants may therefore be a selection criterion for \nidentifying high yielding clones at a relatively early stage. \n The harvest index (24%) observed for Clone S15\/10, for the period two to four years \nafter field planting, is substantially greater than the value of 16% reported for Clone \nUPASI-3 in Southern India (Murty and Sharma, 1986) and the 8% reported for Clone 6\/8 \nat high altitude in Kenya (Magambo and Cannell, 1981).  This new target for the harvest \nindex of tea highlights the potential opportunities for growers to increase yields through \nclonal selection, and Clone S15\/10 in particular may provide a good base from which to \nbreed and select further high yielding clones.  Indeed African Highlands Produce Co. Ltd. \nis already using this clone within its breeding programme in Kenya. \n The stems of Clone S15\/10 were also less woody (they had a high proportion of green \nstem) than those of the other clones.  Increases in the proportion of green stem should \nbenefit yield since it increases both the photosynthetic area and the proportion of the bush \nthat remains harvestable.  This is also likely to reduce the \u2018creep\u2019 in the height of the \ncanopy surface over time and hence extend the length of the pruning cycle.  The \nproportion of the stem that is green may also provide a visible and easily determined \ncriterion for selecting high yielding clones. \n Although Clone S15\/10 partitioned a relatively small proportion of dry matter to thick \nroots, it had a similar mass of fine roots to Clones 1, 6\/8 and SFS150.  It is these thin roots \nthat are believed to be important in determining the uptake of water and nutrients from the \nsoil.  In Assam, high ratios of fine to thick roots in nine-month-old plants of a single clone \nwere linked to rapid canopy growth (Chamuah, 1988), a characteristic also shown by \nClone S15\/10.  By contrast Nyirenda (1990) in Malawi reported that high ratios of thick to \nthin roots were associated with vigorous clones.  This may be true if vigour is defined as \nthe capacity of a clone to develop a new canopy quickly after being pruned.  Field \nexperience in Kenya has indicated that Clone S15\/10 produces less crop than expected in \nthe year immediately after pruning.  The small mass of structural roots in Clone S15\/10 \nprovides a physiological explanation for this observation, as these roots are an important \nsource of the starch reserves utilised during refoliation.  As a result some growers in \nKenya have altered their pruning policy for this clone so that only a proportion, usually a \nhalf, of each plant is pruned at any one time to enhance the rate at which the bushes return \nto full productivity. \n \nEffects of drought:  the short periods of drought imposed had no observable effects on root \ndepth, nor on the amount of dry matter partitioned to structural roots; instead drought \nseverely reduced partitioning to harvested shoots and leaves.  Similar results have been \nreported for very young tea plants five to twelve months after propagation (Kulasegaram \nand Kathiravetpillai, 1976) and for two to four year old field grown clones in Kenya \n(Othieno, 1982).  This supports the view that root growth is less sensitive to low soil water \npotentials than the growth of leaves and shoots. \n  The rates of root extension with depth averaged about 2 mm d-1 from the first to the \nfourth year after field planting and there were relatively small differences between clones \nin root depth.  Since the maximum rooting depth observed at this site for mature tea \n(Clone 6\/8) is about 5.5 m, roots can be expected to reach this depth seven to eight years \nafter planting.  Treatment effects on root distribution with depth will be reported \nelsewhere. \n \n16 \n In summary, although young well-watered tea plants can have a similar radiation use \nefficiency to other woody tropical crops, yields remain limited by a low harvest index.  \nWith some clones, such as S15\/10, it is possible for growers to remove 24% of the net \nannual dry matter production as a saleable crop, although the relatively small mass of \nstructural roots may necessitate a change in pruning practice.  Because partitioning to the \ncanopy and harvested shoots is also affected by temperature, harvest indices above this \nlevel should be achievable where mean annual air temperatures are greater than about \n17\u00b0C.  The trial has also highlighted the adverse effects on yield of even short periods of \ndrought stress on young tea plants through reductions in light interception and, \nparticularly, radiation use efficiency and harvest index. \n \nAcknowledgements.
