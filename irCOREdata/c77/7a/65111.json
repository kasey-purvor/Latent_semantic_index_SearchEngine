We distinguish between three treatments: visual restoration training (VRT), \noptical aids, and compensatory training. VRT is both the most ambitious and controversial \napproach, aiming to restore portions of the lost visual fi eld. While early studies suggested that \nVRT can reduce the visual fi eld defect, recent studies using more reliable means of monitor-\ning the patients\u2019 fi xation could not confi rm this effect. Studies utilizing modern optical aids \nhave reported some promising results, but the extent to which these aids can reliably reduce \nthe patients\u2019 visual disability has yet to be confi rmed. Compensatory approaches, which teach \npatients more effective ways of using their eyes, are currently the only form of treatment for \nwhich behavioral improvements have been demonstrated. However, with the exception of \none study using a reading training, placebo-controlled clinical evaluation studies are lacking. \nIt is also not yet clear whether the training benefi ts found in laboratory tasks lead to reliable \nimprovements in activities of daily living and which of the various forms of compensatory \ntraining is the most promising. It is therefore too early to recommend any of the currently \navailable treatment approaches.\nKeywords: homonymous hemianopia, rehabilitation, treatment outcome\nIntroduction\nThe visual fi eld is the entire space in which visual stimuli can be perceived when the \neyes are fi xating. If someone has a visual fi eld defect this means that they have lost \nthe ability to see visual stimuli which are presented in one part of the visual fi eld. \nWith homonymous visual fi eld defects (HVFDs), the same part of the visual fi eld is \naffected for both the right and left eye. Approximately 20% of people with acquired \nbrain injury may develop a HVFD (Kasten et al 1999), which occurs following dam-\nage to the neural visual pathway, specifi cally damage posterior to the optic chiasm. \nHomonymous hemianopia (see Figure 1), in which one half of the visual fi eld is blind, \noccurs in approximately 75% of cases (Zihl 1995a).\nHVFDs can be very disabling. They impair the patient\u2019s ability to obtain a complete \nvisual overview (Zihl 1995a), which can impact on their ability to interact with their \nenvironment. In addition, patients can experience further impairment in their daily \nlife; for example, driving is prohibited in the majority of cases (Kooijman et al 2004) \nand HVFDs can lead to severe reading diffi culties (Leff et al 2001). Such diffi culties \narising from visual problems can have additional effects on the social and emotional \nfunctioning of the individual.\nTraditionally HVFDs were considered untreatable, but recent advances in our \nunderstanding of the neural capacities for functional reorganization has led to an \nupsurge of attempts to achieve a reduction of the fi eld loss through training. At \nthe same time new rehabilitation procedures have been studied which might allow \npatients to more effi ciently perceive the whole visual world and to improve reading \nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1)94\nLane et al\nperformance despite persistent HVFDs. These procedures \nhave been reviewed previously (Kerkhoff 2000; Pambakian \net al 2005; Pelak et al 2007), including a recent systematic \nreview (Bouwmeester et al 2007), and it was concluded that \ncompensatory rehabilitation procedures can improve the \nvisual searching skills and reading performance of patients \nwith HVFDs. Despite these encouraging results, patients \noften do not receive specifi c rehabilitation for their HVFDs \n(Kerkhoff 1999; Pambakian et al 2005). Therefore the issue \nof how to increase rehabilitation needs to be addressed.\nThis review will examine what is needed to make the \nbehavioral treatment of HVFDs more clinically relevant. \nFirstly, we will address why patients with HVFDs need \ntreatment. Secondly, we will evaluate the effi cacy of the \ndifferent treatments which have been developed. Finally, we \nwill discuss unresolved issues which may currently prevent \nclinicians from implementing the rehabilitation strategies.\nHVFD: Impairment and disability\nReading problems have been objectively observed in 48% \nof hemianopic patients (Zihl 1999a) and are often cited as \nthe most relevant behavioral diffi culty (Kasten et al 1999). \nHemianopic dyslexia is the term used to describe the par-\nticular pattern of reading problems that are associated with \nHVFDs, and the specifi c reading diffi culties depend mainly \non HVFD location (Trauzettel-Klosinski and Brendler 1998). \nFor example, in Western cultures where text is read from left \nto right, patients with right-sided defects experience more \nsevere problems since the parafoveal information to the right \nis crucial for guiding appropriate reading eye-movements. \nFurthermore, reading is typically worse in patients who \nhave less than 5\u00b0 of visual sparing (Zihl 1995b), therefore \nspecifi cally patients with macular splitting or a central sco-\ntoma. However, such patients are the minority of cases (Leff \n2004). Analysis of patients\u2019 eye-movement data indicates that \npatients with HVFDs do not appear to compensate for their \nfi eld loss when reading and show ineffi cient eye-movements \n(Trauzettel-Klosinski and Brendler 1998; McDonald et al \n2006), although this is not the case for all patients (Gassel \nand Williams 1963). Gassel and Williams (1963) also found \nthat some patients with atypical eye-movements can still \nexhibit adequate reading speeds, demonstrating that atypical \neye-movement patterns during reading do not necessarily \nlead to an impaired reading ability.\nHVFDs can also lead to diffi culties creating a complete \nvisual overview, particularly in novel environments, thereby \naffecting the ability to fi nd objects. This ability has been \nexamined using visual search tasks, where the aim is to locate \na target item amongst distracting elements. Patients typically \ntake longer than healthy individuals to complete such tasks \n(Zihl 1995a), and can have similar diffi culties performing \nother visual tasks such as identifi cation and sorting (Zihl \nand Wohlfarth-Englert 1986; Zihl et al 1988). Many patients \nwith HVFDs execute abnormally short eye-movements \n3 0\u00b0\n6 0\u00b0\n90\u00b0\n0\u00b0\nFigure 1 Binocular visual fi eld plot representing a left-sided hemianopia.\nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1) 95\nThe treatment of HVFDs\nwhen looking into their blind regions and each movement is \ntypically slower than that of a normally-sighted individual. \nThis strategy is known as saccadic hypometria (Zihl 2000) and \nlimits the patients\u2019 ability to effectively search their environ-\nment, which contributes to their disorientation and obstacle \navoidance problems. Approximately 70% of patients show \nsuch disorganized searching strategies (Kerkhoff 1999).\nDue to the enjoyment which can be gained from reading \nand other leisure activities requiring visual search skills, \nany impairment in these has obvious consequences for \nthe emotional well-being of the patient (Stelmack 2001). \nSimilarly, HVFDs can restrict many other activities such as \ndriving, which can lead to a loss of independence, thereby \naffecting social and emotional functioning. The primary \ncause of HVFD is stroke (Huber 1992) and accordingly \nmost patients are elderly (Cairns 2004). Therefore, visual \nproblems increase the risk of accidents such as falls, to which \nthis age-group are already prone (Anderson 2002). HVFDs \nalso reduce the effi cacy of other rehabilitation procedures \nwhich may be aimed at increasing the patient\u2019s mobility (for \nexample physiotherapy). Bearing these factors in mind many \npatients have low scores in activities of daily living (ADL) \nmeasures (Patel et al 2000; S\u00e0nchez-Blanco et al 2002), and \nfunctional rehabilitation outcomes are poor (Reding and \nPotes 1988).\nSpontaneous recovery\nSome spontaneous visual fi eld restoration is widely accepted \nto occur. However, the number of patients who experience \nany restoration is undetermined, with reports ranging from \n7% to 85% of cases (Kasten et al 1999). The amount of \nfi eld recovery that an individual can experience is similarly \nvariable (Zihl and Kennard 1996). In an extensive review \nof spontaneous recovery, Zhang and colleagues (2006) \nobserved that the degree of natural recovery decreased as \nthe amount of time since the onset of the HVFD increased. \nThe approximate maximal period of spontaneous recovery \nis typically 3 months (Pambakian and Kennard 1997). In \nsummary, spontaneous visual fi eld recovery does not occur \nin all patients and complete recovery is rare, therefore reha-\nbilitation for such patients is important. Knowing the likely \npattern of natural recovery is important for assessment and \nrehabilitation, and is useful for determining the time at which \ntraining will be maximally effective.\nPatients may also try to adapt to their visual loss. The \nobvious way of compensating for HVFDs is to make larger \nand more frequent eye-movements, specifi cally into the \nblind areas. Unfortunately not all patients adopt this strategy \n(Kerkhoff 1999). Rather, several researchers have shown \nthat the eye-movements of many HVFD patients are very \nsmall and their scan-paths (the pattern of eye-movements \nused to scan a complex visual representation) are disorga-\nnized (Meienberg et al 1981; Zihl 1995a, 1999b; Pambakian \net al 2000). Patients who have a chronic HVFD show more \norganized scanning strategies than those patients whose \ndiffi culties are a recent occurrence (Zihl 1995a; Pambakian \net al 2000). However, many patients\u2019 eye-movements are \nstill disorganized 14 months after onset (Kerkhoff 1999). \nThese abnormal eye-movements can also be observed during \nreading (Zihl 1995b).\nPatients may also use other forms of behavioral compen-\nsation. One method is the use of eccentric fi xation; the eye \nis rotated slightly towards the blind hemi-fi eld rather than \nstraight ahead (Gassel and Williams 1963). This means that \nthe centre of the observed image does not fall exactly on \nthe fovea, but instead the image falls further into the seeing \nfi eld at a slightly eccentric position. This strategy is found in \napproximately 30% of cases and can increase reading speed \n(Trauzettel-Klosinski 1997), although the impact of such a \nstrategy on other activities has not been clearly determined. \nIt is a strategy which may be of use for patients with little \ncentral vision, for example those with macular splitting or a \ncentral scotoma, which as already mentioned is the minority \nof patients (Leff 2004). However, eccentric fi xation is not \na useful strategy for patients with an intact fovea. Another \nstrategy witnessed in children involves to-and-fro rocking \nmotions, to bring greater portions of the visual fi eld into view \n(Boyle et al 2005).\nIn summary, HVFDs are debilitating and the sensory loss \nis exacerbated by the adoption of slow and ineffi cient search \nstrategies when exploring the blind fi eld. The prognosis for \nspontaneous recovery appears poor, and although adaptation \nis possible many patients do not develop effective ways of \ncompensating for their defi cits. Specifi c interventions are \nrequired for these patients.\nIntervention\nMost research has focused on three treatment approaches: \nrestorative training, optical aids, and compensatory train-\ning. The restorative approach is the most ambitious, aiming \nto reduce the visual fi eld loss through prolonged training. \nThe second approach uses optical aids to artifi cially expand \nthe patient\u2019s visual fi eld such that parts of the visual world \nwhich would otherwise fall into the blind fi eld now appear \nin the seeing fi eld. The third approach is compensatory \ntraining. This therapy is based on the assumption that the \nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1)96\nLane et al\nvisual fi eld defect cannot be changed signifi cantly, and \ntherefore attempts to alleviate the resulting disability by \nteaching patients to make more effi cient eye-movements. \nWe will discuss each of these three rehabilitation strategies \nin separate sections.\nRestorative training\nRestorative training aims to restore vision (at least in part) \nto the blind visual fi eld, based on evidence which supports \nplasticity in the visual system of both animals (Cowey and \nWeiskrantz 1963; Cowey 1967; Mohler and Wurtz 1977; \nEysel and Schwiegart 1999) and humans (Donoghue 1997). \nWhilst there was early promise for the potential of such \ntraining (Zihl and Von Cramon 1979; Zihl and Von Cramon \n1985), some dismissed the approach as ineffective, with any \nsupposed fi eld increase being regarded as the product of eye-\nmovements (Balliet et al 1985).\nRestorative training was later revived by Kasten, Sabel, \nand colleagues who introduced a computerized therapy \ncalled Vision Restoration Therapy (VRT; Kasten and Sabel \n1995; Kasten et al 1997). During VRT patients fi xate a \ncentral point whilst visual stimuli are repeatedly presented \nin the border region between the blind and seeing fi eld (the \ntransition zone). The training is typically conducted in daily \none-hour sessions for 6 months. Placebo-controlled studies \nhave suggested that VRT leads to signifi cant increases in \nthe visual fi eld (Kasten et al 1998, 2000), although more so \nfor patients with optic nerve as opposed to cortical damage. \nThese fi eld increases were still observed at least 6 months \nafter the end of the treatment (Kasten and Sabel 1995; Kasten \net al 2001).\nHowever, despite the apparent success of VRT critics \nhave challenged the claim that it is an effective treatment \n(Horton 2005; Plant 2005; McFadzean 2006). This is because \nthe claims of signifi cant fi eld increases found in the VRT \nstudies mentioned above were based on a method of assess-\ning the visual fi eld which was incorporated into the training \ndevice and did not allow a reliable way of controlling the \npatients\u2019 fi xation. The effect of VRT has been re-evaluated \nusing techniques which allowed a much more reliable means \nof monitoring the patients\u2019 fi xation, specifi cally the use of \na scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO; Jamara et al 2003) \ncombined with microperimetry. In studies whereby they \nreliably monitored fi xation during visual fi eld assessment no \nsignifi cant visual fi eld increases were obtained (Sabel et al \n2004; Reinhard et al 2005; Schreiber et al 2006).\nRecently Kasten and colleagues (2006) responded to \nthis challenge by publishing a study in which they used a \nvideo-based system to monitor their patients\u2019 fi xation and \nfound a signifi cant (but somewhat modest) fi eld increase of \n1.8 degrees. This fi nding is insuffi cient to re-establish the \ntherapeutic value of VRT for two reasons. Firstly, because \nthe employed fi xation-control technique is inferior to that \nused by other studies which did not fi nd signifi cant fi eld \nincreases. Secondly, even if we accept the reported fi eld \nincrease, such an increase of 1.8\u00b0 is clearly not enough to \nconvey a clinically signifi cant benefi t to patients who have \nendured 3 months of daily training and invested a consider-\nable amount of money. In this context it is important to note \nthat these expenses are currently not covered by medical \ninsurance companies (Pelak et al 2007).\nEven if the claim that VRT produces a clinically-relevant \nfield increase is dismissed, the widespread subjective \nimprovements reported by many participants of this train-\ning cannot be disregarded (Mueller et al 2003; Sabel et al \n2004). The fact that improvements are sometimes reported by \npatients in the absence of any training-induced fi eld recovery \n(Mueller et al 2003) raises an interesting question: why do \npatients report that subsequent to the training they fi nd it \neasier to fi nd objects and avoid obstacles, if their visual fi eld \nis unchanged? It might be that these reports simply refl ect \nthe patients\u2019 desire to justify a training in which they have \ninvested a lot of time, effort, and money. However, it is also \npossible that VRT leads to behavioral improvements. For \nexample, it is possible that VRT cues patients to allocate more \nattention into their blind fi eld, and such attentional cueing \ncan improve target detection (Poggel et al 2006). Although \nvisual costimulation was found to be no more effective than \nsingle stimulation VRT at expanding the visual fi eld, it is \nclear that VRT has benefi cial effects on attentional perfor-\nmance (Kasten et al 2007). Further research into the role of \nattention for visual fi eld rehabilitation is required.\nIn addition to possible effects on attention, VRT could \nalso inadvertently lead to eye-movements being more fre-\nquently directed into the blind fi eld, although this explana-\ntion is denied by Kasten and colleagues (2006). However, \nit could explain why restorative training leads to changes \nin cortical activity as reported by several small-sample (n = \n1\u20135) imaging and electrophysiology studies (Julkunen et al \n2003, 2006; Pleger et al 2003), since saccadic changes due \nto compensatory mechanisms could infl uence widespread \nneural activity. Initially these changes in cortical activity \nwere interpreted as evidence for the training-induced brain \nplasticity underlying the recovery of visual fi eld loss. How-\never, in the absence of reliable evidence for such visual fi eld \nrecovery this interpretation appears unlikely.\nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1) 97\nThe treatment of HVFDs\nMore encouraging results have been obtained with \nchildren. Werth and colleagues presented fi ndings from ran-\ndomized placebo-controlled trials with a restorative training \nused with children aged between 1 and 15 years (Werth and \nMoehrenschlager 1999; Werth and Seelos 2005). In some \ncases the visual fi eld defect disappeared completely, and \nthe mean increase was 65 degrees. Such dramatic increases \ncoincide with evidence suggesting that there is greater \npotential for recovery from damage sustained early in life \n(Payne et al 1996; Boyle et al 2005), possibly because child \nand adult cases typically differ with regards to etiology and \nlesion location (Kedar et al 2006), or perhaps due to greater \nneuronal plasticity more generally in children. However, due \nto the age of these patients conventional perimetry could \nnot be performed and instead the researchers had to rely \non observed changes in target-directed eye-movements to \nestimate the extent of visual fi eld recovery. Accordingly the \nvisual fi eld measurements and reported fi eld increases are dif-\nfi cult to interpret and could refl ect compensatory mechanisms \nrather than restorative ones. Given the large improvements \nwhich appear possible, this training would appear worthwhile \npursuing with children who have HVFDs.\nIn conclusion, restorative training in adults has failed to \nfulfi ll its early promise. Recent studies suggest that VRT does \nnot lead to signifi cant increases in visual fi eld size but con-\nsistently yields subjective improvements. The basis of these \nsubjective improvements is still unclear but it is possible that \nVRT leads to compensatory changes in behavior which are \nas yet unconfi rmed. However, even if we were to assume that \nVRT leads to signifi cant behavioral improvements it would \nstill be inferior to other forms of compensatory training (see \nbelow) which appear to produce effective behavioral com-\npensation with signifi cantly less effort, cost and time.\nOptical aids\nOptical aids such as prism glasses can be used to reduce the \napparent visual fi eld loss by shifting visual stimuli from the \nblind fi eld into the patient\u2019s seeing fi eld. These prisms are \nfi tted to spectacles but need to be restricted to just one half \nof each of the lenses (typically on the side of the blind fi eld). \nIf the prisms were fi tted across the entire lens then the visual \nspace corresponding to the unaffected side would be moved \noutside the fi eld of view, thereby simply replacing one blind \nfi eld with another. Such prisms can be fi tted to just one eye \n(monocular sector prisms) or both eyes (binocular sector \nprisms). Whilst such aids appear to enhance visual function-\ning (Gottlieb et al 1998; Lee and Perez 1999; Szlyk et al \n2005) they have their limitations. Monocular prisms provide \nan expansion of the visual fi eld but at the cost of creating \ncentral double-vision (diplopia) which patients experience as \nunpleasant. Binocular prisms lead to fi eld relocation rather \nthan fi eld expansion. Such problems probably explain why \nso far these optical aids proved only moderately successful \nin HVFD rehabilitation.\nPeli (2000; 2001) has introduced a new set of spectacles \nwith monocularly fi tted sector prisms which extend across the \nentire width of the spectacle lens but which spare the central \naspect. This is known as vision multiplexing and using this \ntechnique fi eld expansion is achieved without central dip-\nlopia. Peli (2000) reported fi eld expansion of about 20\u00b0 and \nnoted on the basis of subjective reports that patients seemed \nto benefi t from the spectacles. Vision multiplexing seems \npromising but randomized controlled trials using objective \nmeasures of functional improvement are required to evaluate \nthe clinical potential of such a technique.\nCompensatory training\nEven if training cannot achieve a signifi cant reduction in the \nvisual fi eld loss, it might still be possible to help patients to \ncope more effectively with their HVFD. Scanning the visual \nworld systematically with large sweeping eye-movements \nwould appear to be the most obvious form of compensation, \nhowever many patients do not spontaneously adopt this strat-\negy (Kerkhoff 1999). In order to improve patients\u2019 ability \nto compensate for their visual loss, several researchers have \ndeveloped training schemes designed to teach patients more \neffi cient strategies for visual scanning.\nThe compensatory training approaches typically use \ntarget-localization tasks to train patients to make large eye-\nmovements and use visual search tasks to teach patients \nto use systematic scanning strategies when searching their \nvisual world. Sometimes additional training is included \nwhich helps the patient to utilize the strategies in everyday \nsituations such as crossing the street or fi nding objects around \nthe home (Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994; Pambakian et al 2004). \nWith compensation training patients usually receive daily one \nhour training sessions for about four weeks making it much \nless demanding than VRT.\nCompensatory training in general leads to improved \nsearch performance and effi ciency (Kerkhoff et al 1992, \n1994; Zihl 1995a; Nelles et al 2001; Pambakian et al 2004; \nVerlohr and Dannheim 2007). Two studies confi rmed that \nthe improvements obtained after training were signifi cantly \ngreater than those observed during untrained periods and \nare thus training specifi c (Kerkoff et al 1994; Pambakian \net al 2004). For example, Pambakian and colleagues (2004) \nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1)98\nLane et al\nfound that 76% of patients had faster search times following \ntraining, while 14% remained unchanged, and 10% were \nactually slower. Those with slower search times showed an \nimprovement in their detection rates. Compensatory training \nhas also been found to signifi cantly enlarge the search fi eld \n(Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994; Pambakian et al 2004). Addi-\ntionally, studies using eye-tracking show that compensatory \ntraining leads to better organized scanning strategies and \nlarger saccades (Zihl 1995a). Furthermore, it was found that \nthe post-training search improvements could be maintained \nfor at least one month, and in some cases up to 22 months \n(Kerkhoff et al 1992).\nNot only does it appear from these studies that com-\npensatory training can signifi cantly improve search but it is \npossible that it may actually increase the visual fi eld itself \n(Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994). However, not all studies have \nfound signifi cant visual fi eld increases after compensatory \ntraining (Zihl 1995; Nelles et al 2001; Pambakian et al 2004). \nCaution is required when interpreting these fi ndings as the \nsame limitations relating to fi xation control during perimetry \nare present as in studies examining restorative approaches.\nThe reading performance of patients with HVFDs is also \noften impaired (Leff et al 2001). Consequently, specifi c com-\npensatory reading training procedures have been developed \nto directly address this defi cit (Zihl 1995b; Han et al 2004; \nSpitzyna et al 2007). Zihl (1995b) showed that such training \ncan improve reading accuracy and speed although unfortu-\nnately there was no control group and so it is not known to \nwhat extent the effects were due to the training provided. In \ncontrast, a recent study by Spitzyna and colleauges (2007) \nincluded a placebo training to assess the specifi c effects of a \nreading training for patients with hemianopic dyslexia. They \ntested 19 patients with right-sided hemianopia and divided \nthem into two groups. Group 1 received a reading training for \ntwo 4-week blocks. During this training, patients practiced \nreading moving text which scrolled from right to left. In group \n2 patients received a 4-week block of placebo training and \na 4-week block of reading training. In the placebo-training \npatients received pairs of pictures which differed only in a \nnumber of minor features and they had to detect these dif-\nferences. The reading training but not the placebo training \ninduced signifi cant improvements in reading speed.\nThe results surrounding compensatory training indicate \nthe promise which such an approach holds for helping \npatients to adapt to their visual loss, and whilst controversy \ncontinues to surround the use of VRT, compensation would \nappear to be a viable rehabilitation option for the patients \nwith HVFDs. However, it is important to note that for most \ncompensatory training regimes a placebo-controlled study \nexamining their effi cacy is still missing.\nUnresolved issues of HVFD \nrehabilitation\nAs described above the lack of placebo-controlled evaluation \ntrials (for an exception see Spitzyna et al 2007) means that \nthe clinical effi cacy has not yet been established for any of \nthe described rehabilitation procedures. It is thus too early \nto give a fi rm recommendation for any of these approaches. \nHowever, the compensatory training approach is the only \none for which behavioral improvements in the form of \nimproved search times, increased reading speed and larger \neye-movements have been demonstrated. In fact, for one \nform of compensatory reading training its superiority over a \nplacebo-training has already been established (Spitzyna et al \n2007). In contrast the same is not true for either restorative \ntraining or optical aids. In the case of restorative training the \nearly claims of increased visual fi eld size following train-\ning have not been confi rmed by studies using more reliable \nmeans of assessing the visual fi eld size and there is currently \nno evidence that the reported subjective improvements cor-\nrespond to measurable behavioral improvements. In the case \nof optical aids evidence for behavioral improvements are \nalso lacking, in particular for their most promising forms, \nthe vision multiplexing prisms. Thus on the basis of current \nevidence the compensatory approach appears to be in our \nview the most promising, and we will therefore now turn \nour attention to those aspects of the compensatory therapy \nwhich require further research.\nTransfer of training benefi ts to activities \nof daily living\nThe fi rst issue relates to the question of whether the achieved \ntraining gains also lead to relevant improvements in activities \nof daily living (ADL), an aspect which is crucial to the clinical \nevaluation of any rehabilitation procedure. Unfortunately most \nstudies examining compensatory search training either do not \nassess its impact on ADL tasks or rely solely upon subjective \nreports. Using questionnaires several researchers have found \nthat patients do report improvements in such activities as fi nding \nobjects in a room or on a table, and crossing the street (Kerkhoff \net al 1994; Nelles et al 2001; Pambakian et al 2004), indicating \nthat compensatory training produces functional improvements. \nIt is however important to establish the functional benefi ts of \nthe training with behavioral measures since subjective gains \ncan be unreliable indicators of rehabilitation success.\nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1) 99\nThe treatment of HVFDs\nThere are a few studies which have used objective \nmeasures to assess the transfer of training benefi ts to ADL \ntasks. Kerkhoff and colleagues (1994) demonstrated that \ncombined compensatory search training (ie, training which \ncombines search tasks and exercises such as fi nding objects \naround the home) can yield improved search performance in \nmore naturalistic forms of visual search (eg, searching for an \nitem amongst distracters on a table) which use a wider fi eld \nof view than that used during the training. Following training \nthe patients in this study showed a 50% reduction in search \ntime on the table test. Further to this, they also reported that \n91% of the sample returned to some sort of part-time work \nafter the training, indicating a positive functional outcome. \nPambakian and colleagues (2004) reported training-related \nimprovements in performance on activities representing ADL \ntasks, such as threading beads onto string. Whilst this does \nindicate the successful transfer to the visuomotor domain of \nthe training benefi ts, there is a question of how much such \ntasks actually tell us about improvements in more common-\nplace everyday activities. Future work should examine more \nclosely the effi cacy of the training in relation to more relevant \nexamples of ADL.\nDriving is a major activity for which transfer of train-\ning gains would be benefi cial since it is prohibited for the \nmajority of patients with HVFDs. Unfortunately Kooijman \nand colleagues (2004) found that only 2 out of the 17 hom-\nonymous hemianopic patients who failed a test of practical \ndriving fi tness passed this test after a form of compensatory \ntraining. Given the social and emotional impact that the loss \nof driving has on patients with HVFDs the effect that com-\npensatory training has on driving ability should be further \nexamined. It is worth noting that patients with HVFDs may \nbe able to drive as adequately as normal, healthy individuals \n(Schulte et al 1999) and therefore perhaps driving guidelines \nshould be modifi ed such that an HVFD is not an automatic \ncause for license revocation.\nNelles and colleagues (2001) reported that patients\u2019 \nsubjective impression of their reading ability had improved \nafter the compensatory search training. However, since read-\ning performance has not been measured it is not possible to \nconclude if there is transfer from search training to reading \ntasks. Again reading is an activity which many patients report \nhaving diffi culties with and which can severely impact on \ntheir quality of life, and as such should be considered an \nimportant outcome measure in future research. If it is found \nthat general compensatory training can benefi t reading (or \nthat reading training can benefi t other everyday activities) \nthen only one type of training would be required.\nCurrently there is insuffi cient information about how the \ngains achieved with compensatory training transfer to other \nrelevant activities like driving, reading, visuomotor control, \nand visual searching in natural surroundings. Furthermore, \nit is currently unclear whether some ADL tasks benefi t more \nfrom training than others. If it is confi rmed that some ADL \ntasks do not benefi t suffi ciently from compensatory training \n(for example reading), then training which addresses the \nspecifi c requirements of those tasks will be needed.\nPredictors of good training outcome\nNot all patients benefi t from compensatory training. In order \nto maximize its effi cacy it is necessary to identify factors that \ncontribute to the success or failure of this training. Conven-\ntional predictors of rehabilitation outcome, which include \nthe cause of the HVFD (etiology) and the time since onset of \nthe HVFD when training takes place have been examined. \nEtiology does not seem to have a signifi cant effect on outcome \n(Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994), although this is hardly surpris-\ning given that most patients share the same etiology, namely \nstroke. With respect to the timing of training, the results are \nmixed as some studies suggest that earlier training is more \nbenefi cial (Zihl 1995a), whilst others fail to fi nd such an asso-\nciation (Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994). Several studies have failed \nto fi nd any association between age and training outcome \n(Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994; Zihl 1995a). Kerkhoff and col-\nleagues (1992) found that those patients who initially had the \nseverest visual problems were those who showed the largest \nimprovements after the training, thus pre-training impairment \nlevel could predict the possible success of the training.\nA very plausible predictor for good training outcome is \nthe degree of spared visual ability in the blind fi eld. Some \npatients can respond quite accurately to visual stimuli pre-\nsented to their blind fi eld (for example by pointing to it) even \nthough they insist that they cannot see it. This phenomenon \nhas been called blindsight (Weiskrantz et al 1974) and it is \nestimated that 15%\u201320% of HVFD patients show this (Blythe \net al 1987). It has been suggested that training patients to be \naware of their blindsight capacity could be a useful reha-\nbilitation strategy (Boyle et al 2005) and repeatedly testing \nblindsight can lead to improved blindsight performance (Zihl \n1980). It seems plausible that patients with blindsight are \nmore successful in making accurate saccadic eye-movements \nto targets in their blind fi eld and could therefore benefi t more \nfrom compensatory training. However, this prediction has \nnot yet been tested.\nCognitive variables, such as the patient\u2019s ability to allo-\ncate visual attention or their spatial memory capacity, which \nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1)100\nLane et al\nmight contribute to the success or failure of compensatory \ntraining, have not yet been examined. In summary, it seems \nclear that although compensatory treatments benefi t the \nmajority of participants, the factors which predict successful \ntreatment outcome on an individual basis remain unclear.\nComorbidities\nSome previous studies examining compensatory training \nhave excluded people with HVFDs who suffered from addi-\ntional disorders such as oculomotor defi cits or hemispatial \nneglect. Disorder comorbidities are common (Anderson and \nRizzo 1995) and patients with multiple diffi culties are typi-\ncally more functionally impaired than those with a single \ndefect (Patel et al 2000). The impact that this may have on \nrehabilitation has not been fully established.\nHemispatial neglect is a disorder which typically occurs \nafter right-hemispheric damage and leads to patients ignor-\ning sensory information from the contralesional half of their \nbody or surroundings. It might be predicted that patients with \nsuch additional disorders will gain less from compensatory \ntraining. However, some authors have argued that patients \nwith both HVFD and hemispatial neglect can benefi t from the \ntraining but require a more intensive schedule (Kerkhoff et al \n1992, 1994). Similarly it has been shown in a case-study that \na patient with multiple visual problems such as amblyopia \nand impaired form vision could still benefi t from compensa-\ntory training (Hiramaya et al 2004).\nIn summary, HVFD patients with comorbidities such as \nhemispatial neglect may require more intensive training, but \nmay still benefi t from compensatory training. Having said \nthat, the current evidence is scant and rigorous studies com-\nparing the training benefi ts in large samples of patients with \nand without such co-morbidities have yet to be conducted.\nParameters of effective compensatory \ntraining\nAlthough it has been shown that compensatory training in \ngeneral can lead to signifi cant functional gains (Pambakian \net al 2004), a number of different training regimens have \nbeen used and it is unclear which is the most effective. These \nregimens differ with respect to the required effort and cost, \nand it is important to establish whether the simpler and less \ncostly forms are as effective as the more laborious ones. For \nexample, training displays of various size have been used \nranging from computer or television monitors, which train \nonly the central 25 degrees of the visual fi eld (Pambakian \net al 2004), to displays which fi ll the entire visual fi eld (Nelles \net al 2001). It is obvious that training on a small screen is \nless costly because it means that the training can potentially \nbe performed by the patient in their own home, as was done \nin the study by Pambakian and colleagues (2004), and as is \nthe case with VRT (Kasten and Sabel 1995).\nTreatment duration also differs signifi cantly, ranging \nbetween 12 and 60 sessions (Kerkhoff et al 1992). In several \nstudies (Kerkhoff et al 1992, 1994; Zihl 1995a) patients \nreceive training until their performance plateaus or their \nsearch fi eld increases by a specifi ed amount. However in \nthe other studies patients all receive a standardized amount \nof training. Research should attempt to determine what the \nmaximal amount of training required is, and possible fac-\ntors that may infl uence the amount of training required by a \nspecifi c individual. This will ensure that time and resources \nare utilized to their best advantage.\nDifferent types of training programs have not been com-\npared directly and so we do not know yet whether the differ-\nent regimens are equally effective. A confounding problem \nis that different outcome measures are also used in many of \nthe studies making it diffi cult to compare them. Standardizing \nthe outcome measures may aid this process, and Verlohr and \nDannheim (2007) recently proposed the visual performance \ntest as a standardized outcome measure for the purpose of \nassessing search times. This task involves patients having to \nvisually locate as quickly as possible a series of targets which \ncan be at one of eleven positions on a screen. Reaction time \nis the main outcome measure.\nAnother version of compensatory search training combined \nauditory cues with visual search displays and reported signifi -\ncant improvements in exploratory eye-movements and transfer \nto ADL (Bolognini et al 2005). However, it is not known \nwhether the achieved gains are superior to those observed \nwith training using purely visual displays. A direct comparison \nbetween conventional and combined (ie, visual plus auditory \nstimulation) training is required to determine if adding auditory \ncues increases the effi cacy of compensatory training.\nIn summary, there are different versions of compensatory \ntraining available, varying specifi cally in relation to the size of \nthe training stimuli, the duration of the training, and the addi-\ntion of attentional aids. Currently it is unclear which version \nproduces the best clinical outcome. Standardizing outcome \nmeasures will make it easier to directly compare the benefi ts \nof different training techniques, which will allow researchers \nto develop the maximally effective training paradigm.\nConclusion\nWith the exception of one form of a compensatory reading \ntraining (Spitzyna et al 2007) clinical effi cacy has not been \nClinical Ophthalmology 2008:2(1) 101\nThe treatment of HVFDs\nunequivocally established for any of the above described \nrehabilitation procedures. To establish clinical effi cacy random-\nized placebo-controlled clinical evaluation trials are needed. \nCurrently it is therefore too early to recommend any of the \ndescribed rehabilitation procedures. However, we would like to \nargue that compensatory approaches have come further towards \nthe aim of establishing their clinical effi cacy than either the VRT \napproaches or the use of optical aids. In the case of compensa-\ntory approaches several studies found signifi cant behavioral \nimprovements following the training. The same can not be said \nfor either VRT or optical aids. In both cases their claim of clini-\ncal effi cacy currently rests on subjective patient reports and it is \nyet unknown whether these subjective reports of improvement \ncorrespond to measurable behavioral improvements. Apart \nfrom the need for placebo-controlled clinical evaluation trials \nwe have also identifi ed a number of other issues which need to \nbe addressed by future research. These include the question of \ntransfer, which is whether or not the compensatory training leads \nto improvements in relevant ADL tasks, the issue of outcome \npredictors and also which specifi c version of the compensatory \ntraining is the most effective form of treatment.\nDisclosure\nThe researchers are supported by a grant from the Wolfson \nResearch Institute and A.
