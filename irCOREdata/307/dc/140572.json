Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest global user of water representing around 70% of global water use\n(UN\/WWAP, 2003). It is also likely to be the water user which is most affected by climate change\nbecause irrigation water demands are particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature,\nand carbon dioxide levels (Frederick and Major, 1997). Although irrigated agriculture is most\nimportant in dry regions of the world, supplementary irrigation has become increasingly important\n(Stansfield, 1997) in temperate regions to increase yields of certain crops (e.g. sugar beet, maize, etc)\nor to maintain\/improve crop quality (e.g. potatoes and vegetables). There have therefore been\nnumerous studies investigating the likely effect of climate change (temperature, rainfall and CO2) on\nirrigated crops. Many of these studies have identified the yield benefits of irrigation (e.g. Davies et\nal., 1997) or the increased irrigation demand for the current production areas (e.g. Doll, 2002;\nWeatherhead and Knox, 2000). However, such studies fail to integrate potential irrigation demand\nchanges with water resource availability, competing water demands or changed agro-economic\nconditions. Approaches that have been taken to do this have included the use of farm level volumetric\nirrigation caps (Jones 2001) or linkage with water resource and planning models (e.g. Victoria et al.,\n2005; Thomson et al., 2005; Rosenzweig et al., 2004; Strzepek et al., 1999; Izaurralde et al.,2003).\nThese latter studies have generally included scenarios of competing demands (public water supply,\nindustry) arising from changes in population and GDP (usually consistent with the equivalent SRES\nsocio economic scenario), within which priority\u2013based optimization algorithms (e.g Rosenzweig et\nal., 2004) allocate water between these uses. However, despite the more realistic representation of\nlimited irrigation supply in these studies, they still assume that irrigation is occurring within the\ncurrent socio-political environment surrounding water resource management, abstraction licensing\nand agricultural policy.\nIrrigation is a small but important part of UK agriculture, accounting for about 150 000 ha of land and\n160 000 Ml of water in a 'dry' year, both of which are expected to increase due to climate change\n(Woods 2000). Despite its small volumetric demand, irrigation is of significant economic importance\nto farmers, growers, and the food industry, improving crop yields, quality, consistency and reliability.\nThe likely increasing demand for irrigation caused by climate change (Arnell et al., 2001, Downing et\n3al., 2003) is in competition for water with other users (such as the domestic sector and the\nenvironment) which are variably affected by climate and socio-economic change.\nTo better understand the interactions between irrigation and competing water demands in changing\nclimate and socio-economic futures, this paper describes the regional results of linking a farm level\ncropping decision model with a hydrological model, describing water resource availability,\nabstraction management and water demand, in East Anglia and North West England. The models\nhave been developed for, and integrated within, an interactive software tool (the \u2018Regional Impact\nSimulator\u2019 \u2013 Holman et al., 2008) to allow stakeholders to perform their own integrated assessments\nof climate and\/or socio-economic change.\n2. Agriculture and irrigation in East Anglia and North West England\nThe North West of England is the larger of the two regions (Figure 1) and is dominated by higher land\nin the north and along its eastern boundary. The proximity of the North Atlantic produces a generally\nmilder and wet climate (average annual rainfall = 650 - 3200 mm), allowing for the effects of altitude.\nThe diversity of the physical environment produces a range of farming systems, from rough grazing\nfor sheep in the uplands, permanent grassland for sheep and cattle in the lower hills to mixed arable\nand dairy farming in the lowlands. Urban development is focussed in the south of the region around\nLiverpool and Manchester.\nThe climate of East Anglia is influenced by its low relief and proximity to the continent, resulting in\nlower average annual rainfall of 550 - 750 mm per year and a greater daily and monthly temperature\nrange. As a consequence of its relatively dry climate and low-lying topography it is an intensively\ncultivated area, with an emphasis on arable agriculture. The area has a relatively low level of\nurbanisation, with the exception of key urban centres such as Cambridge and Norwich.\nIrrigation is regionally focussed in England, with East Anglia and North West England representing\nthe two contrasting ends of the current irrigation demand continuum. In 2003, 8% of the estimated\nactual national irrigation abstraction occurred in the North West while the highest volume (around\n50%) was abstracted in Anglian region, a larger area which includes East Anglia. Although total\nirrigation use in England and Wales represents less than 1.5% of total abstraction, during peak periods\nirrigation can account for more than 70% of total abstraction in the intensively irrigated areas of\nAnglian region (Morris et al., 2004).\n4There has been a steady trend of increasing irrigation demand, with an underlying increase in water\nuse for irrigation in the Anglian region of about 3% per year. Overall this has led to a national\ndoubling of the amount of water used between 1975-2000. In response to seasonal shortages in water\nand increasing restrictions on summer abstraction licences, the amount of water stored in on-farm\nreservoirs doubled from 33 million to 64 million m3 in the period 1984 to 1995 (Weatherhead et al.,\n1997).\n3. Methodology\nAgricultural and water resource management decisions are taken at very different scales. A multi-\nscalar approach (Victoria et al., 2005) has therefore been adopted to integrate the agricultural,\nhydrological and human systems, within a context provided by the climate and regional socio-\neconomic scenarios:\n1. Field \u2013 crop yields are simulated based on soil and climate conditions;\n2. Farm \u2013 farm level cropping systems are developed, based upon the different gross margins\nresulting from the field-scale crop yields, irrigation cost and regional economic conditions (from\nthe socio-economic scenarios), taking into account rotational and labour restrictions etc;\n3. Sub-catchment and catchment \u2013 the water available for abstraction is calculated for each sub-\ncatchment and catchment, based upon simulated Flow Duration Curves and a measure of how\nwilling society is to impose abstraction-related environmental stress on the rivers;\n4. Region \u2013 a regional water supply \u2013 demand balance is conducted to assess the ability to meet\nwater demand and to ascertain whether demand restrictions \/ increased supply are needed.\nIn order to achieve the necessary fast model run times (Holman et al, 2008), the models were based\nupon existing, robust, state of the art methodologies that allow the estimation of suitable impact\nindicators for the whole region. The modelling approaches are described further in Sections 3.2 and\n3.3\n3.1 Scenarios\n3.1.1 Climate change scenarios\nThe United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme 2002 scenarios, known as the UKCIP02 scenarios\n(Hulme et al., 2002), have been used. These are based on the high-resolution regional climate model\n5(HadRM3) from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. Four climate scenarios were\nselected (the 2020s Low emissions, 2020s High emissions, 2050s Low emissions and 2050s High\nemissions) to capture the effects of uncertainties in future greenhouse gas emissions on UK climate\nand to allow investigation of the evolution of change.\nIn all seasons, and for all scenarios, there is a northwest to southeast gradient in the magnitude of the\nclimate warming over the UK, with the southeast consistently warming by several tenths of a degree\nCelsius more than the northwest. Changes in total annual precipitation, relative to 1961-90, range\nfrom \u20134 to +3% by the 2020s and \u20139 to +7% by the 2050s. Winter precipitation increases in all\nregions with the largest changes of up to 23% occurring in the east. Conversely, in summer,\nprecipitation decreases across virtually all of the UK with the largest changes of up to \u201332% occurring\nin the south.\n3.1.2 Socio-economic scenarios\nShackley and Deanwood (2003) developed regional socio-economic scenarios (SES) specifically for\nthe case study regions, which were enhanced (Holman et al., 2008). The SES are summarised below\nin the context of agriculture in the two regions.\nRegional Stewardship (RS) - The emphasis in this storyline is on recognising and conserving regional\nassets, accepting that this might result in a significantly reduced level of economic growth. Intensive\nagriculture will become more expensive through national and regional level policies, including new\ntaxes or tradeable permits on fertilisers and pesticides. Construction of farm winter reservoirs will be\nencouraged due to higher water charges for irrigation, but rules will limit their development when\nthey significantly reduce winter flows. Incentives for less intensive agriculture will be provided\nthrough regional subsidy packages. The organic foods sector and local farmers markets will grow in\nresponse to local demand.\nGlobal Markets (GM) - Global Markets is based on the pursuit of high and sustained growth within a\nglobal context. There will be a very strong split between agriculture that can compete on global\nscales in the absence of subsidies and that which is not competitive, which will go out of business.\nThere will be some niche markets e.g. for organic foods, but they will remain marginal to the bulk of\neconomic activity. Dairy and beef farming in the North West and horticulture remain globally\ncompetitive and remain as intensive as today in larger farm units.\n6Global Sustainability (GS) - Here the global approaches to achieving sustainable development take\nprecedence over regional responses. Through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), agriculture is\ndirected towards that which is most suitable to be grown locally in the context of a continental scale\nlandmass. The intensive agriculture of East Anglia is transformed towards sustainable production by\ntaxes on fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides, and subsidies for organic and low-intensity farming.\nThere is stronger emphasis on movement towards low intensity farming in the uplands of the North\nWest.\nRegional Enterprise (RE) - The Regional Enterprise scenario is the most bullish of the four scenarios,\nsuggesting vibrant, semi-autonomous regions, keen to promote and maintain their distinctive qualities\nin a highly competitive world. Agriculture will be much more exposed to the market and could\ndecline as a result, although there would be support where this promotes regional cohesion. Many\nforms of arable agriculture in East Anglia will be competing successfully on the global market. In the\nNorth West, some agricultural activities, including dairy and horticulture, will flourish, whilst others\nsuch as subsidy-dependent hill farming will die away.\n3.2 Modelling of agricultural land use decision making\nThe agricultural metamodels are derived from the full agricultural land use estimation model\ndescribed in Rounsevell et al. (2003) and Holman et al. (2005), which combines a crop model which\npredicts the yield of a wide range of crops as a function of climate and soil type, with a farm model\nwhich determines the optimum cropping given crop gross margins, labour and machinery costs and\nsoil workability of a generic farm. The agriculture metamodels are described in Audsley et al (2008)\nand summarised below.\nCrop yields for all 2500 ha grid squares within each region are predicted from crop-specific neural\nnetworks, which were fitted to crop yield data from the ACCESS model (Holman et al., 2005), soil\ndata (rooting depth and soil water availability), weather parameters, latitude, carbon dioxide level and\nirrigation level data. The performance of the neural networks are evaluated in Audsley et al. (2008)\nThe farm metamodel uses a regression approach to predict the percentage of the farm in each of the\ngiven crops and the resulting profit. Based upon the level of profit, land is classified as either\ncropped, extensive or abandoned, from which levels of production, water use and nitrate leaching are\ncalculated. The regression equations use the relative crop gross margin of each crop, the soil type and\nworkable hours in the winter, the maturity date of each crop, spring and autumn evapotranspiration\nand rainfall, and the change in labour and machinery costs.\n7The model iterates, altering the prices of crops and water, to obtain the correct level of production of\neach commodity, limited by the scenario-defined permitted level of irrigation in each region. A\nmaximum of 10 iterations are allowed as this has been found to be sufficient in most cases. In the\nagriculture metamodel, only potatoes (representing irrigated vegetables) and sugar beet can be\nirrigated, for which the optimum level of irrigation (0, 100mm or 200mm per season) is chosen, given\nthe cost (variable, capital and labour) of irrigation. Although processing factories do not currently\nexist, sugar beet is permitted in the North West in order to determine future potential. Any solution of\nthe agricultural metamodel (areas of all the available crops) defines an amount of irrigation used in\nthe region, due to the relative gross margins of the irrigated and non-irrigated crops. It is assumed that\nthe baseline model solution corresponds to the current availability of irrigation water. For future\nscenarios the crops produced and irrigation used are compared to the required levels of production and\nirrigation water availability. If any value is outside a tolerance, the prices of the crops and water are\niteratively adjusted.\n3.3 Modelling of water resources, water supply, and water demand\nThe hydrological and water resources metamodels are fully described in Henriques (2007) and\nsummarised as follows.\n3.3.1 Modelling of catchment hydrology\nThe catchment hydrological model is based upon a regionalised catchment scale empirical method,\nthe Low Flows Estimation method of Gustard et al. (1992), which has been previously validated and\ncalibrated over a wide range of conditions in the UK. That method has been modified to estimate the\nwater resources indicators for each catchment i.e. the Mean Flow (MF) and the naturalised Flow\nDuration Curve (FDC). The MF (m3\/s) is calculated from:\nMF = (AAR \u2013 LOSSES) \u00d7 AREA \u00d7 3.17\u00d710-5 (1)\nWhere: AAR is the Average Annual Rainfall, mm\nLOSSES are the losses due to the average annual evapotranspiration, mm\nAREA is the catchment area, km2\nThe LOSSES parameter of Gustard et al. (1992) was adapted to be sensitive to changes in\nlanduse\/cropping (from the Agriculture metamodel) and urbanisation (from the Urban and Suburban\nland classes of the Land Cover Map 2000 for the baseline, and from the spatial urbanisation patterns\nwithin the future SESs). LOSSES from agricultural crops in a catchment for a given climate scenario\n8were estimated from Equation 2, where the coefficient k reflects both the soil water stress and crop\ncoefficients, which were derived from multiple runs using the WaSim model (Hess et al., 2000) for\nthe range of soil-crop-climate combinations.\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5 \uf03d \uf0b4\uf03d cropsni ii cropkETpLOSSES 1 (2)\nWhere: ETp is the catchment average annual Potential Evapotranspiration, mm\nncrops is the number of modelled crop types (including grass)\nKi is the average annual coefficient relating the actual evapotranspiration of crop i to the\npotential reference evapotranspiration\nCropi is the proportion of a catchment with the crop type i\nLOSSES from urban areas were estimated from Equation 3. Urban areas are assumed to consist of\n100% hard surfaces and Suburban of 50% hard surfaces and 50% grass. It is assumed that 0.4 mm of\nrainfall is retained on hard surfaces after rainfall to be lost through evaporation, based upon Van de\nVen et al. (1992).\nWetdays\nSuburban\nUrbankET\nSuburban\nLOSSES grassp \uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf02b\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d 4.0\n22\n(3)\nWhere: Suburban is the proportion of a catchment with Suburban land class\nUrban is the proportion of a catchment with Urban land class\nkgrass is the coefficient relating the actual evapotranspiration of grass to the potential reference\nevapotranspiration estimated as described above for the crops.\nWetdays is the annual number of wet days with rainfall greater than 0.4 mm, days\nThe LOSSES for the remaining non-agricultural portions of the catchments, or for those catchments\nflowing into the region, was estimated from Equation 4, based on that in Gustard et al. (1992).\nLOSSES = r \u00d7 ETp (4)\nWhere: r is the reduction factor due to catchment dryness as a function of AAR\nFor each catchment, the naturalised daily flow exceeded 95% of the time; i.e. the low flow Q95, was\nfirst derived (according to Gustard et al. 1992) from the estimated MF (using equations 1-4), and then\nthe naturalised FDC is derived from the estimated MF and Q95 using the area-weighted average of\n9the 10 low flow Hydrology Of Soil Types (HOST) groups (Boorman et al., 1995) plus lakes and urban\nfractions (from the sum of Urban and Suburban land classes). The estimated naturalised FDC using\nthe derived improved methodology was successfully validated by comparison of the simulated low\nand high flows, Q95 and Q10 (i.e., the daily flow exceeded 10% of the time) respectively, with\ngauged data (Table 1) from 79 catchments throughout the 2 contrasting regions, demonstrating the\nrobustness of the metamodel.\n3.3.2 Modelling of catchment abstraction availability\nOnly a proportion of the total manageable resource assumed to be represented by the long term\nnaturalised FDC for each catchment is available for abstraction. The integrity of freshwater\necosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow.\nIt is important therefore that national water management policies explicitly incorporate freshwater\necosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes (Baron et al., 2002).\nEngland and Wales has the most heavily protective system of abstraction control in the UK, as the\nEnvironment Agency (and its predecessor the National Rivers Authority) has statutory powers to\nlicense all abstractions. To be reasonably consistent with current abstraction management policy in\nEngland, an approach similar to that of the Environment Agency's Resource Assessment Management\n(RAM) framework (Environment Agency 2002; Dunbar et al., 2004) has been chosen out of the many\nmethodologies available for calculating environmental flow allocations (e.g. reviews by Acreman and\nDunbar, 2004; Tharme, 2003). Moreover, it has been assumed that abstraction licensing restrictions\nare likely to be in operation under all socio-economic futures due to the longstanding water resources\nmanagement structure in England and Wales.\nWithin the RAM methodology, five environmental weighting bands that classify the flow regime (and\nfrom which, when coupled with the FDC, the total annual abstraction availability is estimated) are\nbased on site-specific assessment of species\u2019 sensitivity to abstraction pressures. In the absence of\nsuch data regionally, the environmental weighting bands have been substituted by a subjective 5-point\nRegional Environmental Priority (REP) scale, which represents the willingness of society to allocate\nwater to aquatic ecosystems to prevent abstraction-related hydrological stress by protecting low flows\nand flow variability of the catchments. The values chosen range from 2 (high) for environmentally-\nfocussed futures (GS and RS) to 4 or 5 (low) for market-driven futures (RE and GM, respectively),\nwith the Baseline being given as 3 (medium).\n3.3.3 Modelling of regional water supply\u2013 demand balance\n10\nBecause of regional supply networks, abstraction of water does not necessarily occur close to the\npoint of use, or indeed in the same catchment. Water is currently transferred over large distances, and\nthe future extent of such transfers or the network that supports them cannot be predicted for the\nvarious socio-economic storyline. As a result, water supply and demand are estimated at the regional\nscale and the robustness of the regional supply-demand system to the pressures exerted in the scenario\nis measured by the relative balance of the supply and the demand.\nThe abstraction availability in each catchment is summed to derive the regional abstraction\navailability to which the reservoir storage capacity and net regional water imports are added. Where\nregional boundaries do not match catchment boundaries, the catchment water availability is reduced\nby the proportion outside the regional boundary.\nRegional water demand is given by the sum of the agricultural irrigation (from the agricultural\nmetamodel), domestic, and industrial\/commercial demand, augmented by leakage calculated as a\nproportion of water provided by the Public Water Supply (as opposed to direct abstraction by users).\nAlthough domestic water demand, especially personal washing and garden watering is sensitive to\nboth climate and socio-economic change (Environment Agency, 2001, Herrington, 1996), it has been\nassumed that the dominant driver is socio-economic in terms of consumption trends and population.\nIt has also been assumed that industrial use is insensitive to climate change as it is conditioned by\ntechnologies and modes of use (Arnell et al., 2001), although Downing et al. (2003) defends that\nclimate change impacts on industry and commerce are likely to be higher than the impacts on\ndomestic consumption. However, those impacts of climate change are minor compared to the impacts\nof socio-economic factors (Downing et al., 2003). Leakage, as a percentage of the public water\nsupply, increases from baseline under the RE scenario due to low levels of investment in leakage\ncontrol, while it decreases the most under the GM scenario due to the market forces of competition\n(Environment Agency, 2001).\n4. Results\nThe intention of the Regional Impact Simulator was to develop a user friendly and interactive\nsoftware tool, which stakeholders could use to assess the implications of climate and socio-economic\nchange for themselves. The Regional Impact Simulator is freely available to the stakeholder\ncommunity through the UK Climate Impacts Programme website (www.ukcip.org.uk), so that the\nuser can interactively examine different scenarios, and the effects of individual model input\nparameters. The value of the Simulator (and the metamodels described within this paper) is not\ntherefore limited to the restricted number of model runs described herein.\n11\n4.1 Reconciling changes in abstraction availability and irrigation demand under future climate\nscenarios\nClimate change impacts the naturalised flows on which the abstraction availability is based, with the\nreduced annual rainfall and increased evapotranspirative losses in the 2020s and 2050s being reflected\nin reduced river flows. As a result, under baseline socio-economic conditions less water is available\nfor abstraction for all users (Figure 2) under all climate scenarios, although the significant effects do\nnot manifest themselves until the 2050\u2019s, as the reductions by the 2020s shown in Fig. 2 are only\naround 10% of current levels. By the 2050s under a High climate change scenario, abstraction\navailability in East Anglia is reduced by over 250 Ml\/d, a reduction of around 30% compared to\ncurrent availability. Similar absolute reductions in abstraction availability are seen in the North West\nregion, although abstraction availability is much higher in the North West compared to East Anglia.\nIn parallel with the reduction in abstraction availability, there are variable changes in irrigation\ndemand in both regions (Figure 2) due to autonomous adaptation. In East Anglia, irrigation demand\nappears to remain relatively stable, apart from under a 2050s High climate scenario when it increases\nby about 40% (compared to the baseline). In the North West, irrigation demand increases by between\n200 and 250% under the 2050s High and 2050s Low, respectively, but the large percentage rise\nreflects the very low baseline irrigation demand. The changes in irrigation demand result from:\n1. the increase in water demand by the irrigated crops due to the warmer and drier growing season in\nall the climate scenarios;\n2. the relative changes in gross margins due to the differing yield response of all arable crops,\nleading to differing crop selection choices by farmers arising from autonomous adaptation, and;\n3. shifts in the relative irrigation of sugar beet and potatoes.\nIn East Anglia, despite the relatively static or increasing irrigation demand, Figure 3 shows that the\ntotal regional production of potatoes and sugar beet (i.e. irrigated and unirrigated) increases under the\n2020s climate scenarios (relative to the Baseline). In the 2050s, the production of sugar beet declines\nand potatoes increases under a Low emissions scenarios whilst both potato and sugar beet production\ndecrease under a High emissions scenario. The changes in the 2020s appear to result from a\ncombination of a CO2 fertilization effect and a shift in irrigation from sugar beet to the higher value\npotatoes (and horticultural crops). In the North West, a similar pattern is seen, although sugar beet\nproduction declines under the 2020s High scenario. The decline in sugar beet and potato production\nunder the 2050s High climate shown in Figure 3 appears to occur within the unirrigated cropping,\nwith a small increase in the irrigated areas and in irrigation demand (Figure 4).\n12\nThe net result of the decrease in abstraction availability coupled with the increase in irrigation demand\ndiffers between the two regions. Even under a 2050s climate, with its resultant decrease in abstraction\navailability, there is still a positive supply-demand balance in the North West (Figure 5) due to the\nvery high water availability, indicating that the increased irrigation demand should be satisfied.\nHowever, in East Anglia, the supply-demand balance under baseline socio-economic conditions\nshows a progressively increasing supply deficit (Figure 5) indicating that current water resource\nmanagement practices would become unsustainable. Significant demand management and supply\naugmentation would be required to maintain a balance, but if the environmental flow allocation for\nthe river ecology is not to be changed, this could not be satisfied without further irrigation demand\nconstraints (Table 2).\n4.2 Influence of climate and socio-economic changes on abstraction availability and the supply-\ndemand balance\nWith changing futures, the profitability of irrigation changes, due to changes in water costs, demand\nfor produce, gross margins etc. Table 3 shows that future irrigation demand in East Anglia\nsignificantly differs across the SES for the same climate scenario, but increases almost under all\nfutures compared to the baseline.\nThe largest changes to the regional supply-demand balance are dependent on the socio-economic\nfutures (Table 4). Under the GS and RS scenarios, the high REP requires water to be allocated to\nprotect the river ecology at the expense of abstraction availability (Table 5). The net result is that\ndespite reduced water demand in these futures (mainly from industrial\/commercial users, Table 5),\nthere is a significant water resources deficit. Under the lower REP scenarios of GM and RE, the\ninteraction of supply with demand differs. Under the GM scenarios, approximately sufficient water\ncan be abstracted to satisfy the demand, but under the RE scenarios the reduced abstraction\navailability (due to a higher REP than the GM future, but which is still lower than the baseline), and\nhigh demand (partly due to very high leakage) produces a negative supply-demand balance (Table 5).\nAs a result of the combination of the climate and different socio-economic pressures, for East Anglia\nunder the 2050s High climate, water shortages are likely without significant adaptation. Under GM,\nGS and RS the water deficit is smaller than under baseline socio-economic conditions (Table 5) and\nthus the socio-economic pressures moderate the impacts of climate change. The deficit under all the\nscenarios is likely to lead to further restrictions on water demand, particularly in drier than average\nyears, unless adaptation responses are implemented or a relaxation of the environmental allocation\nbecomes inevitable.\n13\n5. Discussion\n5.1 Assessing changes in abstraction availability\nFreshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and so its utilization for consumption,\nirrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over services and functions provided by freshwater\necosystems. With a limited resource, water has to be shared or allocated between competing uses,\nprincipally public water supply, the environment, irrigation and industrial water supply. The relative\nweights which society puts upon these different uses will affect the mode of resource allocation.\nHistorically human water uses have taken priority over the environment in many parts of the world,\nwith public water supply for drinking taking overall precedence. However, there is growing\nrecognition that fluvial ecosystems are legitimate users of water (Naiman et al., 2002) and that\nfunctionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable\nservices and long-term benefits to society (Baron et al., 2002). Increasingly, therefore policy is\nplacing greater or greatest priority on the environment - for example, the Water Framework Directive\nin Europe aims to ensure that all water bodies achieve \u2018good ecological status\u2019 which requires the\nhydromorphological conditions (including flows) to be close to pristine. To achieve these aims, it is\nnecessary to ensure that the environmental needs are identified (Tharme, 2003; Acreman and Dunbar,\n2004) and met.\nEvaluation of the regional abstraction availability is the most difficult component of a regional study\nas no simple figure can be given for the environmental flow requirements of rivers (Acreman and\nDunbar, 2004). In the past, such assessments were based on simple \u2018hydrological methods (Tharme,\n2003) such as fixed-percentage or look-up table methodologies in which a minimum flow based upon\na set proportion of the dry weather flow represented by the Q95 was maintained. Acreman and\nDunbar (2004) suggest that where many catchments need to be assessed, rapid methods such as look-\nup tables are appropriate. However, the modified-RAM approach adopted in this study, using a REP,\nproduces an ecologically acceptable FDC which retains many characteristics of the flow regime such\nas the low flows and flow variability, which are not given by the simple methods.\nThe approach taken to derive abstraction availability in this study bases the availability of water on\nthe naturalised FDC i.e. the flows that would occur in the absence of abstractions and discharges.\nAbstraction is therefore allowed based upon the potential impacts of abstraction on river flow (and\nhence on the aquatic ecosystem) without considering the potentially moderating influences of\n14\nabstraction returns. As such is does not allow for re-use of water, either directly through non-\nconsumptive grey water use (Diaper et al., 2001) or indirectly through recharge of aquifers by leaking\nwater supply pipes (Yang et al., 1999; Hooker et al., 1999) or river flow augmentation from sewage\ntreatment works. In East Anglia and the North West where significant volumes of water are\nabstracted from groundwater or are provided by reservoirs or water transfers, water returns will\nsignificantly increase the availability of water for abstraction in receiving catchments during summer\nlow flow periods.\n5.2 Influence of socio-economic futures on regional water supply\nWithin global change studies it is important to recognise the water needs of the aquatic environment,\nbut also to recognise that the relative priorities given to human and environmental needs is neither\nstatic nor constant between socio-economic futures. The results for the abstraction availability under\nthe different climate and socio-economic scenarios have shown that significant effects of climate\nchange are not manifested until the 2050s but that the socio-economic futures cause large changes in\nwater supply.\nThe regional water supply is affected through direct and indirect interactions of differing importance\nwith the hydrological and policy environments. The SES directly affect the water supply by\nincreasing reservoir storage and water imports and by altering the landscape by two principle means:\n1. Future regional population and urban planning policy will determine the changes to the Urban\nand Suburban areas within the regions and consequent hydrological effects resulting from\nchanged evapotranspiration and surface sealing.\n2. The agricultural policy within the SES determines future changes to the agricultural landscape\nand the crops grown within it. This might result from:\na. changes to agricultural policy e.g. farm subsidies, CAP reform;\nb. changes in fuel\/transport\/climate change mitigation policy leading to large demands\nfor non-food bioenergy crops;\nc. technical changes such as increased yields; and\nd. non-agricultural policy scenario inputs such as increased labour and fertiliser costs.\nThese SES-induced landscape changes, coupled with changes in agriculture practices resulting from\nclimate change, affect the abstraction availability by altering the hydrological behaviour through\nchanged evaporative losses. Despite these direct impacts on hydrological behaviour, the indirect\ninfluence of the socio-economic futures on abstraction availability through the policy arena is much\n15\nmore significant. The determination of the volumes of water that can be abstracted is determined by\nthe value that society places on the environment and the consequent reluctance for environmental\nstress to be imposed on aquatic habitats and species. By accepting greater environmental stress,\nparticularly at times of low flow, a future society can significantly increase the availability of water\nfor human uses but at the probable cost of reduced ecosystem services.\nTable 6 separates out the changes in water supply in East Anglia due to climate change (given by a\n2050s High climate), the direct landscape change and reservoir capacity and net water imports effects,\nand the indirect REP effects, under the GM and RS futures. These show that the regional decrease in\nabstraction availability due to climate change is partially moderated, under both futures, by the\nchanges in the urbanisation and agriculture landscapes caused by the SES. However, the greatest\neffect is that caused by the choice of the environmental rights of the river systems to water. The\nspatial variability of the distribution in abstraction availability changes due to climate change and\nsocio-economic change are shown in Figure 6.\n5.3 Limiting future irrigation abstraction \u2013 water pricing, tradable markets or licence\nrestrictions?\nSignificant future water resource shortfalls have been identified in East Anglia under current socio-\neconomic conditions and the environmentally-protective GS and RS SES under all climate scenarios.\nSuch a situation is already recognised as there is already no additional water available for surface or\ngroundwater abstraction, particularly in summer, in many parts of East Anglia. The future drier\nconditions will therefore necessitate significant adaptation responses if draconian water resource\nrestrictions under the current water management policies are not to be implemented in these socio-\neconomic futures.\nThe two principal institutions responsible for drought management in the two study areas are the\nEnvironment Agency (the national environmental regulator) and the water utilities. Currently, the\npolicy instruments that they deploy to manage drought are informational, infrastructural and\nregulatory. It has been advocated by Merrett (2004) that the regulatory instruments of drought\nmanagement should be replaced by economic instruments, or that water markets should be set up for\nfarmers to sell their water rights (Merrett, 2003). However, water markets are likely to lead to the\ntransfer of water away from agriculture towards higher value uses such as the leisure sector (in\nparticular golf courses) and domestic and industrial water use.\n16\nWhilst such an approach has advantages, such as providing the greatest volumetric economic benefit,\nit may have significant social and economic implications for the rural agricultural community (Morris\net al., 2004) in removing a resource which provides access to higher value commodities such as\npotatoes, vegetables etc. Irrigated farming in England performs well against financial and social\nindicators of sustainability - farm incomes and value-added after subsidies are shown by Morris et al.\n(2004) to be considerably higher than rainfed cropping, reflecting the role of supplementary irrigation\nfor produce quality enhancement. In social terms, rural employment is higher and the seasonality of\nwork (picking and processing) is more even, often with very positive multiplier effects in the local\ncommunity.\nIn areas of future water deficit arising from climate and socio-economic change such as East Anglia,\nbanning or severely restricting the use of water for irrigation is a policy response that should be\nconsidered with extreme caution. Restrictions on agricultural irrigation can be achieved directly\nthrough regulatory approaches (e.g. licence restrictions) or indirectly via economic instruments\n(principally volumetric abstraction costs). Historically, the Environment Agency in England and\nWales was only empowered to charge for water on the basis of the costs of administering the licensing\nand regulation system, and not for the environmental costs of abstraction. The main instrument to\ncurrently limit the environmental impacts of abstraction is that of restrictions on the abstraction\nlicences, especially volumetric or trigger limits on summer abstraction. However, the Water\nFramework Directive will introduce changes in the use of economic instruments, in particular the\nprinciple of full cost recovery of water services which will include the cost of environmental\nprotection and mitigation of impacts.\nThe effectiveness of economic instruments on agricultural water demand is not solely dependent on\nwater pricing, but also on the food production priorities and markets of the SES. Irrigated agriculture\nwithin the economically-driven GM future under a 2050s High climate, in which local food\nproduction is not a priority in the global market, is relatively price sensitive to irrigation water costs\nwith increases in total cost producing progressively larger reductions in water demand (Figure 7).\nAlthough average total irrigation costs (for relatively large irrigated areas) currently range between\n\u00a30.30 - 0.70 per m3 applied in the field according to the need for water storage, licensed abstraction\ncharges are only about 5-7% of total costs, so that a 5% increase in total costs reflects a doubling in\nthe current volumetric charge. In contrast, a far greater increase in water costs within the RS future\nproduces no significant decrease in irrigation demand as local food production is a priority with\nresultant higher crop prices and gross margins. For example an absolute increase in water cost of\n50% produces a decrease in irrigation demand of less than 10%. This is despite the higher default\ncosts of water under this scenario which are 190% of current levels. The above cost increases under\nthe RS scenario represent significant increased costs to the farmer. However, regional irrigation\n17\ndemand, even under these higher costs, is similar to the current baseline demand (Figure 8), although\nchanges in irrigation demand are not spatially uniform.\nAlthough the overall effect of price increases on irrigation demand differs between the scenarios,\nthere are similarities in the simulated farmer responses. In both cases, the increase in water cost leads\nto a relative shift in water usage towards higher value crops, so that there is a larger decrease in sugar\nbeet production (-5% for both GM and RS) than for potato production (and by inference vegetable\nproduction), because of its higher value (-0.4% for GM and -1.3% for RS). Such a shift has been\nobserved in the UK, with the largest decreases in irrigated area and volume for low value uses such as\nirrigating cereals and grass (Weatherhead et al., 1997).\nThe results show that the efficacy of pricing to control water demand varies according to the socio-\neconomic conditions prevailing within a future. Under futures where local sustainable agricultural\nproduction is a priority, total irrigation water costs need to rise significantly before significant\nreductions in irrigation abstraction are observed. Because of the strength of irrigation demand\namongst the potato (and by inference vegetable) irrigators and the high marginal benefit of water on\nthese crops, farmers would, at least in the short term, be inclined to absorb the price increases before\nthey significantly change their water consumption. Morris et al. (2004) suggest that to achieve a 10%\nreduction in water consumption in England using the water price mechanism would require water\nprices to rise from \u00a30.03\/m3 for summer water to about \u00a30.75\/m3, which would lead to a 40%\nreduction in income to the farmers.\nIn such socio-economic futures, constraints on irrigation demand are best managed through\nvolumetric restrictions on the abstraction licences, and trigger limits on summer abstraction. In more\nmarket-orientated futures, the likely increases in water charges of 30-40% over the next five years,\npossibly doubling over 10 years (Morris et al., 2004) due to full cost recovery may be sufficient to\ncontrol demand.\n6. Conclusions\nA multi-scale approach has been applied for linking farm level agronomic decisions with an\nassessment of regional water supply that allows for the water needs of the aquatic environment and\nthe competing demands for water in East Anglia and North West England. Irrigated agriculture is a\nregionally important sector in East Anglia, and will continue to be so in some form in most socio-\neconomic futures. Climate change may lead to increased irrigation demand arising from increased\n18\natmospheric demand (East Anglia and North West) and increased crop suitability (North West).\nUnder baseline socio-economic conditions, such increased demands for water can be met under all\nclimate scenarios in the North West. However, in the drier East Anglian region, increases in irrigation\ndemand are counter to the decreasing availability of water mainly due to the reduced winter rainfall\nunder all climate scenarios. Therefore, in the absence of socio-economic change, the availability of\nwater for irrigation in East Anglia is likely to get further restricted.\nThis study incorporates the relative priorities given to human and environmental water needs\nrecognising that they are neither static nor constant between socio-economic futures. The future\nsupply-demand balance is mainly dependent upon the water demand under economically-focussed\nfutures (GM and RE) and upon the water supply, as primarily determined by the priority given to the\nenvironmental allocation of water, under environmentally-focussed futures (RS and GS). For East\nAnglia, under GM and RE, the lower priority that is given to environmental flow requirements results\nin significantly increased availability of water, but which is wholly (RE) or partly (GM) offset by\nincreasing demand from all sectors (domestic, industrial\/commercial and agriculture) and leakage.\nUnder RS and GS, the decreased allocation of water for abstraction and resultant decreased supply\ndoes not meet the decreased demand, necessitating further adaptation.\nThe simulated future water shortages in East Anglia suggest that adaptation responses will have to be\napplied to the different water users, although the need differs according to the socio-economic futures,\nas the impacts of climate change on the water supply-demand balance are moderated under the GS,\nGM and RS futures. Restrictions on agricultural irrigation can be achieved directly through\nregulatory approaches (e.g. licence restrictions) or indirectly via economic instruments (volumetric\nabstraction costs). The effectiveness of water pricing as an irrigation demand reduction tool is\ndependent upon the scenario. Under a scenario in which regional food production is important (e.g.\nRS), the demand for irrigation water is relatively insensitive to water price and abstraction control will\nbe more effective. However, in the globally competitive future of GM, irrigation demand is price-\nsensitive with relatively small price increases causing large reductions, especially in irrigation applied\nto sugar beet.\n7.
