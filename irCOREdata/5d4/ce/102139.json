Introduction\nMost agent-based models (ABMs) are intended to simulate some real-world phe-25\nnomena and are therefore designed and validated by referring to data collected from\nthe social world. Most often, such data are in numerical form. For example, the data27\nmay record the number of agents over time, obtained from organisational or gov-\nernment records; agents\u2019 opinions about some issue, derived from attitude surveys;29\nor the number of transactions and their prices obtained from market records. There\nare well-developed statistical techniques for summarising such data and comparing31\nthem with the outputs of simulation models.\nUnlike most other modelling approaches, there is nothing inherently quantita-33\ntive about agent-based modelling. It should be as easy to develop and validate\naAlthough the best-known techniques make assumptions about the statistical distribution of the\ndata that may not be appropriate for many ABMs, e.g. those that generate power-law distributions.\n1\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\n2 L. Yang and N. Gilbert\nABMs with qualitative data as it is with quantitative data. Nevertheless, this is1\nfar less often done (a noteworthy exception is Agar [1, 2]). In the next section, a\ndistinction is made between two types of qualitative data: one that can be used in3\nalmost the same way as quantitative data and one that for methodological reasons\nmust be treated quite differently. Section 3 briefly describes an example of build-5\ning a model based on qualitative data, and Sec. 4 considers the extent to which\nethnographic data match the ABM methodology. Section 5 concludes with a few7\ntentative guidelines for using such data for agent-based modelling.\n2. Qualitative Data and Ethnographic Research9\nAt its simplest, qualitative data cannot be converted into numeric values with-\nout distorting the information they contain. There are two types of such data and11\nthey are fundamentally different in nature. First, there are data that are collected\nusing social measurement techniques such as surveys. The data may be gathered13\nusing nominal (e.g. black, white, green) or ordinal (e.g. agree, neutral, disagree)\nscales, rather than interval or ratio (i.e. numerical) scales [3], but, like conventional15\nquantitative data, the measurements are made on variables with one value for each\nrespondent and can be stored and analysed as a variable\/actor matrix. Such quali-17\ntative data can be collected, managed and analysed using methods similar to those\ndeveloped for quantitative data, with the exception of statistical techniques that19\nrequire arithmetic operations on the values [4, 5]. For instance, with a categorical\nscale such as \u201cpolitical party voted for in the last election\u201d, it would be inappropri-21\nate to calculate the mean vote, although it is still possible to find the modal (most\nfrequent) party voted for. Because categorical and ordinal data can be used in the23\nconstruction and validation of ABMs in much the same way as quantitative data,\nthis type of data will not be further considered here.25\nThe idea of qualitative data also encompasses an entirely different type of data\n(and the common use of the term \u201cqualitative\u201d to cover both often leads to confu-27\nsion). These are data that are generally textual in form, such as field notes obtained\nfrom observation, transcripts of interviews, and published documents, although29\nthey can sometimes consist of images, video or audio. Such data are not read-\nily converted into a variable\/actor matrix without losing information or doing an31\ninjustice to the data. The important feature of such data is that they are about\nthe meanings that participants ascribe to events and actors. To distinguish such33\ndata from the categorical data mentioned above, they will be called \u201cethnographic\u201d\ndata [6].35\nEthnographic data are often collected and analysed on the basis of epistemolog-\nical and ontological assumptions that are significantly different from those typically37\nadopted by quantitative researchers. At first sight, these assumptions may seem to\nget in the way of their application to the design and validation of ABMs, but in39\nfact the difficulties are not as great as they appear. The basis for most ethnographic\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\nGetting Away From Numbers: Using Qualitative Observation for Agent-Based Modelling 3\ndata collectionb includes:1\n(1) Epistemological orientation: Ethnographic researchers often espouse natura-\nlism \u2014 seeking to understand the particularities of a social phenomenon in its3\nown terms in rich detail \u2014 while quantitative researchers often, although not\nalways, adopt a covering law model of explanation seeking deductive laws that5\nare of universal or near-universal application. Agent-based modellers tend to\nadopt a middle way, expecting their models to have some degree of generality,7\nbut rarely proposing that the models could have universal application (although\nsome game theorists come close to that ambition).9\n(2) Causation: While quantitative research is generally concerned with identify-\ning correlations between variables, ethnographic studies are more interested in11\ncausal mechanisms, i.e. \u201cby what intermediate steps, a certain outcome follows\nfrom a set of initial conditions\u201d [7].13\n(3) Ontological perspective: Ethnographic studies are frequently based on con-\nstructivism [8], which considers that social actors continually (re)construct15\ntheir social world (rather than it being objectively available to them a priori).\nThis contrasts with the positivist or, more frequently, realist orientation of17\nmost quantitative and agent-based modellers [9]. Critical realism [10] takes the\napproach that there are some \u201creal\u201d social processes or mechanisms existing19\nthat generate the observations that actors and researchers perceive.\n(4) Methodological orientation: Ethnographic researchers generally adopt an induc-21\ntive approach, in which theoretical categories are generated from consideration\nof the data (e.g. the procedure called \u201cgrounded theory\u201d [11]). In contrast,23\nquantitative research usually involves testing hypotheses and, at least in their\nwritings, modellers tend to adopt a deductive approach, in which a simulation,25\ndesigned on the basis of some prior theory, is tested to see whether it conforms\nto observed data.27\n(5) Importance of generalisation: Many ethnographic researchers adopt an idio-\ngraphic stance, i.e. aiming to understand the particular and contingent char-29\nacter of the case they are studying, and tend to be sceptical about the\npossibility and the value of generalisation to universals. Agent-based modellers31\noften assume that their models express some general patterns and structures,\nalthough they will be instantiated with particular parameters to represent some33\nspecific case.c\n(6) Emic versus etic orientation: An emic description is one that is formulated35\nin terms that are meaningful to the actor [13]. Typically, ethnographic data\nare emic, in contrast to etic data, which are formulated using concepts mean-37\ningful to the researcher, but not necessarily to the actor. Both quantitative\nbInevitably, not all ethnographic, quantitative and agent-based studies exactly match the descrip-\ntions suggested in this list, but the majority do.\ncFor example, a \u201chistory-friendly\u201d model [12].\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\n4 L.

Mainly because it\nis often difficult or expensive to collect time-varying quantitative data, there is5\nless emphasis on the process in most quantitative studies. In this respect, agent-\nbased modelling, in which the passage of time is represented by simulated time7\nsteps, is closer to ethnographic than to quantitative research. Ethnography\nalso emphasises context: that the meaning of actions depends on the context in9\nwhich they are carried out. This is also a usual element in ABMs, where agents\nare given rules of behaviour that are context-specific (i.e. whether and how a11\nrule is activated depends on the current state of the agent and its environment).\nThese similarities and differences between agent-based modelling and ethno-13\ngraphic research are summarised in Table 1 and illustrated in the next section,\nwhich describes research on the socialisation of members into service work teams.15\n3. An Example\nLu Yang has been conducting a study of the socialisation of newcomers into existing17\norganisational groups, and examining how the entry of a new member reshapes the\nmembers\u2019 interactions and the structure of the group [16]. Data were gathered19\nby participant observation of two service work groups: one in a library, where the\ngroup task was to record book loans and returns, stack returned books and perform21\nroutine administration; and the other in a nursing home, where the group task was\nto carry out personal care for a number of bedridden patients. Each observation was23\nconducted for a period of six months by participation in the work group as a new\nteam member. The study generated copious and detailed field notes recording the25\ndBut this is not always true: see the companion modelling movement [14] and participatory mod-\nelling more generally.\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\nGetting Away From Numbers: Using Qualitative Observation for Agent-Based Modelling 5\nresearcher\u2019s observations and providing direct evidence of the activities of members1\nand changes in group behaviour.\nThe \u201ctranslation\u201d of these field notes into a rule-based computer program3\ninvolved two stages. First, a narrative account of the socialisation process was\nconstructed. This began with an overall picture of the setting, the culture and5\nthe members\u2019 everyday procedures. For example, the nursing home was situated in\nthe countryside of south-east England. It is privately owned, medium in size, and the7\nresidents there are old and with various clinical needs. The functioning of the nurs-\ning home, including details such as how many nurses and carers were employed,9\nwhat kind of work they engaged in and the procedures they used, was described.\nThen, a number of themes were identified, and illustrated with stories about11\nspecific events and incidents that were observed. The observation data were used to\ndiscuss, for instance, the high employee turnover rate, variations in the quality of13\nservice, the boundaries of friendship groups, the hostility of existing staff towards\nnewcomers, etc. Explanations of these features of life in the nursing home were15\nformulated in terms of themes, e.g. that the care workers established their identities\npartly by reference to their ethnicity, that co-workers often got angry with others17\ndue to task conflicts, and that new carers learnt practical skills not from formal\ntraining but from working with more experienced carers.19\nMuch ethnographic research stops at this point, with a plausible narrative that\naims to explain the observations by reference to descriptions of social processes.21\nHowever, such descriptions tend to be vague and difficult to validate. We wished to\ntake the analysis a stage further by constructing an ABM that represented abstract23\nversions of these processes.\nThe second stage of the analysis therefore consisted of the design and implemen-25\ntation of an ABM that encapsulated some of the essential features of socialisation\nobserved in the two settings. As recommended by Dey [17], qualitative data analysis27\n\u201cinvolves a process of abstracting from the immense detail and complexity of our\ndata those features which are most salient for our purpose\u201d. The ABM holds the29\npromise of helping to identify which features are most salient, ensuring that the\nextracted features are consistent and coherent, and providing a way of validating31\nour conclusions by running the simulation. A recurring problem, however, was how\nto model aspects of the settings without making them more precise or concrete33\nthan the observational data would warrant (cf. Whitehead\u2019s \u201cFallacy of Misplaced\nConcreteness\u201d [18]).35\nThe model, implemented in NetLogo [19], was designed to have the following\nfeatures:37\n(1) Agents work on tasks. Agents and tasks are each represented as objects (i.e. as\n\u201cturtles\u201d in NetLogo). A decision had to be made about how many of each type39\nof object to create. For example, this involved \u201cabstracting\u201d from the number\nof carers that were employed in the nursing home (the actual number varied41\nfrom one week to the next and by shift) to a constant number of agents (that\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\n6 L. Yang and N. Gilbert\ncould varied from 1 to 9 between runs) and categorising the activities of the1\ncarers into precisely 10 tasks.\n(2) Agents have attributes. It was observed that people\u2019s demographic charac-3\nteristics (e.g. age, gender, race and \u201caggressiveness\u201d) were salient in their\nrelationships with other team members. In the model, each characteristic is5\nrepresented by the value of an agent attribute. The attributes are used to cal-\nculate the initial attraction that each agent has to the others. There are many7\nsocial-psychological studies that support the proposition that demographic\nattributes affect social integration (e.g. [20\u201322]). However, neither these studies9\nnor our observations are able to quantify the degree of attraction given by these\nattributes, nor do they say anything about the attributes\u2019 relative importance11\nor the functional form of the relationship. Consequently, an arbitrary choice\nwas made (a function based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coef-13\nficient) and a sensitivity analysis conducted to see whether variations made a\nsubstantial difference to the outcomes (they did not).15\n(3) Tasks have a priority level and a completion time. Since there are a maximum\nof 10 tasks at any time, the priority level ranges from 0 to 9. When applied to17\nthe library service team, priority level 9 represents front-line service; priority 8\nmeans sorting book trolleys, and so on. The rank ordering of priority was based19\non what had been learned from observation of library work. The time taken to\ncomplete each task and the increase in speed at which a task is performed when21\nmore than one person works at it were also estimated from the observations.\nHowever, while in the model all tasks were assumed to take the same amount23\nof effort, in reality different tasks took different times and the rates at which\nthey were carried out depended on many factors beyond the number of workers25\nassigned to them.\n(4) Agents that leave are immediately replaced by new, unsocialised agents. Obser-27\nvation confirmed that a new employee will be recruited to replace a worker who\nleaves. For simplicity, the model was designed so that one worker left and was29\nreplaced after a fixed number of time steps; in the settings, the timing of res-\nignations was irregular.31\n(5) Agents have \u201cemotions\u201d. The field notes showed that emotion played a key role\nin the socialisation of new team members in both settings. A typical instance33\nis shown in Fig. 1, an extract from the observer\u2019s notes.\nThis was represented in the model by formulating rules of interaction such that35\nif any one agent displays certain emotions, other agents check their attraction value\ntowards this agent. If an agent decides to respond to the one who displays emotion,37\nthe attraction matrix is updated. Unfortunately, however, it is not clear how to\ndecide on how much the attraction value should be increased. Nor is it easy to39\nsettle on a value for the emotion display threshold. There is no theory or empirical\nbasis for these and other numerical manipulations.41\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\nGetting Away From Numbers: Using Qualitative Observation for Agent-Based Modelling 7\nDay 10:\nMarkus started to arrange the working group.\n\u0091Gayle group 1, Flora group 2, Cora group 3, Shana group 4, Abigail group 5 and Lu \ngroup 6.\u0092 Gayle left the room. \n\u0091YOU CAN NOT DO THIS TO ME!\u0092 Abigail sat straight up, stared at Markus, and \nshouted at him. (I know, of course, it\u0092s me! Group 5 and 6 work in the wing of the home, which is \nthe part that has the most resident care needs. This part is considered to be the hardest part of \nthe job. It\u0092s normally the last part to finish every morning. The morning washing and dressing job \nshould be finished by 10:30am, maximum 11am. Sometimes, if other groups finish earlier, they \nnormally come and help the wing groups; however, they are not obliged to do so.) Markus didn\u0092t \nsay a word, but looked pained. I can see he\u0092s trying to think how to deal with this. (Well, I don\u0092t \nthink he has any choice though.) Then you heard different voices rose up, cross-netted (mainly \nCora, Abigail and Flora), I had no clue what exactly they were talking about, the only thing I knew \nwas that it concerned the groups! (I have no right to say, or, maybe more accurate, better not to \nsay anything), I kept silent, but looked at them shouting to each other. (I felt sorry for them, but \nwell, I am new, I am new! And that\u0092s the fact; I cannot change it in one night! I need to learn and \nlearning takes time, simple as that. I\u0092m already trying my best.) Finally, there ended up with a \nsolution, Flora turned to me, \n\u0091Lu, there is a change about the groups, now, you are with Gayle upstairs and I\u0092m with \nAbigail on the wing. OK?\u0092\n\u0091Ok.\u0092 What else I can say. Abigail\u0092s still looking angry at Markus. (poor him! Sorry.)\nFig. 1. Extract from field notes recorded on the tenth day of participant observation at the\nnursing home. [All the participants\u2019 names have been changed except for the observer\u2019s (Lu).]\nDespite our efforts to reduce the number of unsupported numerical constants1\nand arithmetical operations within the model, it did not prove possible to eliminate\nmany of them. One could \u201ccheat\u201d, removing numbers by tricks of coding, or increase3\nthe apparent quantification by using numerical instead of symbolic values for all\nconstants. While the presence of unjustifiable, \u201cmagic\u201d constants in the code was5\nthe clearest example, it was not the only instance where the model had to be made\nmore definite than the ethnographic record could justify. For example, in the model,7\nagents that leave are immediately replaced (i.e. in the next time step). It looks as\nthough there is no quantification here, but there is an implicit zero number of time9\nsteps between one agent leaving and the next arriving. In practice, in both the\nlibrary and the nursing home, there was almost always some time gap before a new11\nmember of staff could be recruited, trained and formally inducted.\nTo resolve this problem, it was necessary to engage in a further process of13\nabstraction. As noted above, both ABM modellers and ethnographic researchers are\ninterested in mechanisms, i.e. the processes or sequences of events that causally link15\ninitial conditions and outcomes [7, 23]. A mechanism is a theoretical construction\ndescribed in abstract terms (for example, the mechanism of an epidemic involves a17\nvirus infecting a susceptible victim, who in turn infects another victim \u2014 here the\nconcepts \u201cvirus\u201d and \u201cvictim\u201d are theoretical terms). The ethnographer observes an19\ninstantiation of the mechanism (Ann infects Bob, or, in the nursing home, Charles\nhas an argument with David) and infers the mechanism from his or her observa-21\ntions, through a process of abstraction. In doing so, many quantities, even if they\nare observed at all, are discarded (for example, the account of the epidemic may23\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\n8 L. Yang and N. Gilbert\nignore the time taken for the virus to make the victim infectious; in the library,1\nthe ethnographer may record but then disregard the number of arguments between\nCharles and David and simply note the existence of conflict). The modeller has to3\ngo the other way: given an abstract social process or mechanism, he or she has to\ninvent some numbers in order to fill out the theory sufficiently to create a work-5\ning implementation. The important issue in inventing these numbers is not their\nspecific values, but that the implemented model must be an instantiation of the7\ndesired mechanism.\n4. The Relationship Between ABMs and Ethnographic Data9\nThe purpose of building an ABM to represent the library and nursing home case\nstudies was to formalise and verify the set of mechanisms that led to the main11\nfeatures of the settings that were observed. This involved creating a specification\nof the model and the behavioural rules to be followed by the agents, implementing13\nand running the model, and comparing the outcomes with the ethnographic record.\nIn terms of the issues listed in Table 1 of Sec. 2, this requires:15\n(1) A realist orientation, in which observable social action is considered to be gen-\nerated by the modelled social processes. Although critical realism is usually17\nassociated with an objectivist stance, it is possible to couple realism with con-\nstructivism if one allows for agents to construct the meanings and concepts19\nthey use as a response to the social environment in which they act. However,\ngiven the fairly primitive models of cognition and language use in almost all21\ncurrent ABMs, modelling of such aspects is unusual.\n(2) Either a deductive approach, in which the model is formulated and then tested23\nagainst the ethnographic data, or an abductive one, in which a theory and thus\na model is induced from the data and then the model is tested against the data25\nand discrepancies used to improve the model.\n(3) A concern with generalisation. ABMs normally represent a general theory about27\nhow some social phenomenon works. Ethnographic data about one particular\nsetting can be used as a case study or a \u201ccritical case\u201d that can be used to help29\nto validate a model \u2014 more precisely, to falsify the model if it is incapable of\ngenerating a representation of the behaviour observed in the setting.31\n(4) An etic approach, i.e. one that uses the analyst\u2019s concepts, but where actors\u2019\nconcepts are, as far as possible, allowed to emerge from the operation of the33\nmodel.\n(5) The usual interest in process and context that can be found in most ABMs.35\nWorking within these constraints, it seems possible and useful to construct an\nABM that represents the processes or mechanisms that have been discovered from37\nethnographic research. However, the model cannot be expected to confine itself to\nrepresenting the ethnographic data and no more, for an ABM will inevitably require39\nmany \u201cnumbers\u201d or, more accurately, modelling assumptions, that are not to be\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\nGetting Away From Numbers: Using Qualitative Observation for Agent-Based Modelling 9\nfound in the data. This is not a difficulty provided that the model does represent1\nat some abstract level the same mechanisms as are identified in the ethnographic\nanalysis.3\n5. Conclusions\nIt has been suggested that it is possible to use ethnographic data, such as field5\nnotes from participant observation in the design and validation of ABMs, but that\nthere are a number of areas where a modeller will find himself or herself having7\nto move away from the conventional assumptions and methods of ethnographic\nresearch. While the agent-based modelling community needs to gain more experi-9\nence of using ethnographies in their work, some advice can already be formulated\nfor those contemplating using ethnographic data:11\n(1) Ethnographic data are usually very rich and detailed, while simulation models\ntend to be somewhat abstract. In order to bridge the gap, it will be necessary13\nto develop analyses of the ethnographic data, possibly using computer-aided\nqualitative analysis (CAQDAS) toolse to help manage, code and search the15\ntextual data.\n(2) Although typically an ethnographic study describes just one particular setting,17\nit can be used as a case study of a more general class of settings. It may be\nuseful either to conduct more than one ethnographic study, so that settings can19\nbe compared, or to locate descriptions of other settings that can substitute for\nfirst-hand data collection.21\n(3) Ethnographic data are often good sources of information about relationships,\namong actors and between actors and objects. A model of the data will need23\nto represent such relationships, i.e. the model is likely to be based on networks\nof agents.25\n(4) Ethnographies usually contain descriptions of social processes that are equiv-\nalent to the kinds of mechanisms that are typically modelled by ABMs. This27\nhelps to lay out these processes explicitly in the ethnographic analysis before\nattempting to model them.29\n(5) The modeller will have to add \u201cconcreteness\u201d to the model beyond the evi-\ndence in the data (e.g. choosing numeric values for thresholds and multipliers;31\nselecting distributions for random number generators; assigning attributes to\nagents either at random or in some arbitrary way). This is an inevitable part33\nof the process of using ethnographic data as the foundation of an ABM. As far\nas possible, such choices should be justified by conducting a sensitivity analysis35\nand showing that they do not have a significant effect on the outcomes of the\nsimulation, while recognising that it is impracticable to test the sensitivity of37\nevery aspect of a model.\neSee, for example, the reviews and resources available at http:\/\/caqdas.soc.surrey.ac.uk\n1st Reading\nMarch 26, 2008 19:8 WSPC\/169-ACS 00155\n10 L.

The model\nmay generate outcomes and patterns that correspond to these features, and if5\nit does, this helps to validate the model.\n(7) The modeller should consider the implications of a stance that proposes that7\nthe way people structure their worlds is not based on an external reality but a\nculturally generated and fluid categorisation that is self-organising and emer-9\ngent. While this constructivist perspective is hard to accommodate, given the\nstate of the art in agent-based modelling, one can at least try to represent some11\nof its implications.\nEthnographic data, we contend, are no less relevant to building ABMs than13\nquantitative data. However, while there is already much experience in using quan-\ntitative data to design and validate ABMs, there are relatively few examples of15\nABMs based on ethnographies and little advice to guide the modeller. We hope\nthat this paper will inspire more consideration of how ethnographic data can best17\nbe used by modellers.\nAcknowledgment19\nWe acknowledge the partial support from the project \u201cEMIL: EMergence In the\nLoop: simulating the two-way dynamics of norm innovation\u201d, funded by the Euro-21\npean Commission Sixth Framework Programme \u2014 Information Society and Tech-\nnologies \u2014 Citizens and Governance in the Knowledge-Based Society.23\nReferences\n[1] Agar, M., My kingdom for a function: modeling misadventures of the innumerate,25\nJournal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 6 (2003) 8.\n[2] Agar, M., Agents in living color: towards emic agent-based models, Journal of Arti-27\nficial Societies and Social Simulation 8 (2005) 4.\n[3] Sirkin, R.
