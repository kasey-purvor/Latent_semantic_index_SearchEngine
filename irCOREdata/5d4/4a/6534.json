It brings together like-minded people and enables the collaboration that is so\nimportant to effective design, development and implementation of computer-facilitated\nlearning.\nALT-C 99 was organized this year by some of the key players in the area of learning\ntechnologies in UK higher education: the CTI (Computers in Teaching Initiative with ten\nyears of expertise in the provision of discipline-specific support, information and advice)\nand the Institute for Learning and Research Technology (a leading national centre of\nexcellence in the development and use of technology-based methods in teaching, learning\nand assessment). It was sponsored by the Joint Information Systems Committee (the body\nwhich oversees the strategic development of information systems and information tech-\nnology within UK HE).\nInformation and communications technology now plays an undeniable role in learning and\nteaching as evidenced by the record-breaking number of delegates attending ALT-C 99. We\nwelcomed 460 delegates from around the world to the City and University of Bristol and\nreceived over 300 proposals for presentations (another record).\nThe philosophy at the core of the conference, whose theme was Design, Practice and\nOutcomes, lay in bringing together a discipline-specific and a generic focus, and developing\ngreater opportunities for participation. This was achieved by including a day of subject-\nspecific presentations, led by the CTI, in collaboration with other projects and programmes\nand introducing longer themed discussion sessions. Interactive presentations (short 'rolling\nshow-and-tell' sessions) were also a new feature of this conference and provided a chance\nto listen and discuss a wide range of topical issues. These proved to be popular with\ndelegates offering opportunities to exchange ideas and opinions with fellow delegates.\nAlso introduced was a greater number of keynote presentations which slotted into the\ndifferent focuses of each day, based upon each element of the conference theme. Another\n2\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number I\n'first' for ALT-C was involving some of the UK's leading commercial players in this field in\nthe academic programme who participated in the Work in Progress sessions.\nThe following papers are a selection given at the conference beginning with that from\nCarmel McNaught, one of the keynote speakers, 'The staff development at RMIT:\nbottom-up work serviced by top-down investment and policy'. These papers illustrate the\nrange of topics covered and the depth of discussion that took place at the conference, from\nissues of staff development and initiating change, to case studies of Web-based learning\nand costing the life cycle of networked learning. They provide stimulating reading, and\ncertainly reflect well the conference itself as well as the increasingly important and evolving\nrole of learning technologies.\nJoyce Martin, Co-Chair, Head of CTISS (now Head of National Learning Network\nMaterials Development, BECTa)\nJane Williams, Co-Chair, Head of JISC ASSIST\nRos O'Leary, Conference Co-ordinator (Manager, Learning Technology Support Service),\nInstitute of Learning and Research Technology, University of Bristol\n3\n"}
