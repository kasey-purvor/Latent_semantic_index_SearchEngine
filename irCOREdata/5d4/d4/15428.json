These ultra-cold atoms are ideal systems with which to \ninvestigate  quantum degenerate  matter  [2,3],  and  also  have  great  technological  potential  through \ndevelopment of matter wave interferometry [4], atomic lithography [5,6],  novel sensors [7], and in \nquantum information processing [8,9].\nCommon to all of these applications is a necessity to closely control the positions and motions of cold \natoms. For example, there is great interest in developing \u201catom optics\u201d, devices which manipulate  \nbeams of cold atoms in a manner analogous to conventional optical components such as mirrors,  \n1\nbeam splitters and diffraction gratings [10-12]. Other applications require that cold atoms are confined \ninto potential wells, thus creating atom traps or waveguides [10-13].   \nTwo main approaches can be used to manipulate atoms: Firstly, optical forces may be used, either \nthrough the optical dipole force as in an optical lattice [14] or an evanescent wave mirror [15,16] or  \nvia  the  scattering  force,  as  in  a  magneto-optic  trap  (MOT)  [17].  Alternatively,  in  the  case  of \nparamagnetic  atoms,  magnetic  field  gradients  produced  by  either  current  carrying  wires  [18]  or \npatterned ferromagnetic structures [19] may be used. Although optical techniques are currently more \ncommonly used, magnetic manipulation has the potential to be highly important in future \u201catom chip\u201d \ndevices, due to the ease with which micrometer-scale current lines and ferromagnetic structures may  \nbe  fabricated.  Atom chips  made  from ferromagnetic  films  are  particularly attractive due  to  their  \nrobustness and low power consumption. \nTo create atom traps\/atom optics from a ferromagnetic material it  must  be patterned with a well-\ndefined, spatially varying magnetization structure.  Several techniques have been applied to achieve \nthis. These have included writing magnetization patterns on audio and video tapes [20,21], creating \nstacks of macroscopic permanent magnets [22], lithographically patterning ferromagnetic films [23-\n25],  optically  writing  magneto-optical  films  [26,27]  and  etching  patterns  into  granular  hard-disk \nmedia [28]. A common factor of all of these approaches is that they use hard magnetic materials, i.e.  \nmaterials  with  strong  magnetocrystalline  anisotropies  that  dominate  the  behavior  of  their  \nmagnetization.  Contrastingly,  the  behaviors  of  softer  magnetic  materials,  such  as  Ni 80Fe20, are \ndominated  by  magnetic  shape  anisotropy,  meaning  that  their  geometry  directly  controls  their \nmagnetization structure. This offers new routes to obtaining non-uniform magnetization structures \nwhich are suitable for manipulating atoms.\nIn a previous study [29] we have presented theoretical calculations which demonstrate the feasibility \nof creating zero dimensional atom traps using the magnetic fields emanating from 180\u00b0 domain walls \n(DWs) in Ni80Fe20 nanowires [30]. These DWs are intrinsic to the nanowire geometry, and may be \nformed easily and reproducibly in positions governed by the shape of the nanowires using uniform \nexternal magnetic fields. This is in contrast to the intricate writing procedures required when using  \nharder magnetic materials [20,21,26,27]. The DWs also have sub-micrometer dimensions and hence \ncreate high magnetic  field gradients,  thus offering extremely tight  confinement  of trapped atoms.  \nAnother important property is the reconfigurability of the DWs, which can be propagated controllably \naround nanowire circuits using applied magnetic fields or electric currents [31-33]. This offers the  \nexciting  possibility  of  mobile  atom  traps  which  could  be  used  to  transport  qubits  in  quantum \ncomputing applications. The reconfigurability offered by DWs differs from that offered by arrays of  \ncurrent-carrying wires [34] in that  nanomagnetic technology is  inherently non-volatile,  and hence \npower is only dissipated when a system\u2019s configuration is altered. The freedom with which individual \n2\nDWs may be moved around nanowire  networks may also offer  a  wider  range of  magnetic  field  \nconfigurations than can be achieved using simple conductors.\nIn this paper we present the design and characterization of a simple nanomagnetic atom mirror which \nwill  be  used  to  investigate  experimentally  the  interaction  of  cold  atoms  with  DWs  in  Ni 80Fe20 \nnanowires. We first develop a model which allows the geometry of an effective reflecting surface to  \nbe  calculated.  We then  go  on  to  discuss  the  fabrication  of  the  atom mirror  and  characterize  its  \nmagnetic behavior, showing how the mobility of the DWs within the nanowires allows the mirror to \nbe  switched  \u201con\u201d  and  \u201coff\u201d  in  a  manner  which  could  not  be  achieved  using  conventional  \nferromagnetic designs. Finally, we model the dynamics of 87Rb atoms reflecting from the surface of \nthe atom mirror, thus demonstrating the feasibility of future experiments where these interactions will \nbe probed experimentally. Experiments of this nature will lay a foundation for studies in which DWs \nwill be used to trap cold atoms.   \nTheory\nA paramagnetic atom moving adiabatically in a magnetic field gradient B\u2207 will experience a force:\nBF \u2207\u2212= BFF gm \u00b5 (1)\nwhere  Fm is the atom\u2019s magnetic quantum number,  Fg  is the Land\u00e9 g-factor and  B\u00b5 is the Bohr \nmagneton. If the atom is in a state where 0>FF gm  (i.e. its magnetic moment is quantized such that \nit has a component opposing the quantization axis) it is repelled by regions of increasing magnetic \nfield, and hence is said to be in a \u201cweak-field seeking\u201d state.  \nConventional magnetic mirrors are created  using a sinusoidally varying magnetization pattern. This \nmagnetization distribution produces lines of constant magnetic field which lie parallel to the film\u2019s  \nsurface [22]. The magnetic field decays exponentially, and hence it is a good approximation to assume \nthat an atom in a weak-field seeking state incident upon the film with kinetic energy U perceives a flat \nreflecting surface at height rz  when:\n)( rBFF gmU zB\u00b5= (2)\nAny higher harmonics present in the film\u2019s magnetization profile corrugate the reflecting surface [35]. \nThis effectively makes the mirror\u2019s surface rough, such that the atom\u2019s dynamics contain an element  \nof diffuse reflection.   \nTo replicate such a mirror using DWs in magnetic nanowires we propose the undulating nanowire \ngeometry shown in Figure  1(a).  When a  magnetic  field is  used  to  saturate  and then  relax these \n3\nnanowires perpendicular to their length (Hy) head-to-head (H2H) and tail-to-tail (T2T) DWs will be \nformed at the apexes of the curves (\u201con\u201d state) . The DWs have a dominant monopolar character  \n(North or South), and hence the nanowires can be considered as an array of magnetic poles with \nalternating polarity. This is a discretized equivalent of the pole distribution in conventional magnetic  \nmirrors, where the sinusoidal magnetization results in a cosinusoidal pole distribution. \nUnlike magnetic mirror designs which utilize hard magnetic materials, the design we propose allows \nthe atom mirror\u2019s magnetization to be reconfigured such that its reflecting properties are \u201cswitched \noff\u201d. Shape anisotropy favors magnetization that is continuous along the nanowires, and hence by \napplying a magnetic field along Hx a state similar to that shown in Figure 1(b) will be formed (\u201coff\u201d \nstate). As this state contains no DWs, no magnetic field is created above the nanowire array.\nTo model  the  magnetic  fields  produced by the \u201con\u201d state  we approximate  each DW as a point-\nmonopole, as shown schematically in Figure 1(c). The array in the figure is curtailed for clarity; much  \nlarger arrays were used in the calculations presented here (~104 DWs). At a position r above the array \nthe magnetic scalar potential is calculated using:\n \u2211\n\u2212\n=\narray\niq\nirr\nr\n04\n)(\npi \u00b5\n\u03c6  (3)\nWhere qi is the total \u201cmagnetic charge\u201d of each of the DWs and \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space. \nThe magnetic field can then be calculated using:\n)()( rrH \u03c6\u2212 \u2207= (4)\nqi may be calculated by evaluating the following intergral over the volume of a DW:\n\u222b \u222b \u222b \u22c5\u2207\u2212=\nV\ni dq VM0\u00b5      (5)\nBecause  the  total  magnetic  charge  of  a  H2H  or  T2T  DW,  qi,  is  independent  of  its  internal \nmagnetization structure qi can be derived analytically by considering the abrupt DW shown in Figure \n1(d).  The integral  is  then easily evaluated by invoking the divergence theorem and summing the \nmagnetization flux entering the highlighted region:\nwtMq si 02\u00b5\u00b1= (6)\nA positive charge represents a H2H wall (North monopole), while a negative charge represents a T2T \nwall (South monopole).  w  and  t are the nanowire width and thickness, and  Ms = 860 kA\/m is the \nsaturation magnetization of  Ni80Fe20.  As is  shown in Figure  1(c),  end domains  must  be assigned \ncharges half this magnitude to ensure that the array carries no net monopole moment.\n4\nModeling\nTo optimize the geometry of the nanowire array for use as an atom mirror we consider a simple  \nexperiment in which a cloud of atoms is \u201cbounced\u201d from the mirror under gravity. For 87Rb atoms in \nthe 52S1\/2 F = 2, mF = 2 state, dropped onto the mirror from a height of 1 cm, reflectH = 15.7 Oe will \nbe required to reflect the incident atoms (Equation 2). \nWe performed calculations to understand how the nanowire geometry affects the total \u201creflectivity\u201d of \nthe array, i.e. the proportion of the array\u2019s surface above which a magnetic field in excess of reflectH\nis obtained. The calculations were performed for a 100 x 100 cell discretization of the central unit cell  \nin a 100 x 100 \u03bcm2 array of nanowires. Two parameters were varied: the thickness of the nanowires, t, \nand the average diameter of nanowire curvature d (indicated in Figure 1(c)). To maximize qi, while \nretaining wire-like magnetic properties, we set the width of the nanowires, w = 0.25d. \nFigure 2(a) illustrates how the mirror\u2019s reflectivity varies with d for constant t = 30 nm. At large d the \nreflectH field surface is composed of approximately spherical shells surrounding each of the DWs. As \nd decreases these begin to cover a larger proportion of the array\u2019s  surface, resulting in the rapid  \nincrease in reflectivity. However at low d the surface is no longer composed of discrete shells, but is \ncontinuous from one DW to another and thus further decreasing d has a reduced effect.\nFigure 2(b) shows how the reflectivity varies with  t for a constant  d = 1 \u03bcm (w =  0.25 \u03bcm). The \nplateau in the data is once again due to a transition from a field surface composed of discrete shells to  \na continuous surface.\nBearing in mind these results, we selected values of d = 0.5 \u03bcm and t = 30 nm for our experimental \nnanowire array. We limited  d to this value as further decreases would necessitate the fabrication of \nnanowires with sub-100 nm dimensions, which is challenging for the large (mm2) arrays  required \nexperimentally. We limited  t to 30 nm to reduce the likelihood of forming complex DW structures \n[36] and to limit the applied field required to switch the array into the \u201con\u201d state [37]. \nTwo-dimensional  (2D)  micromagnetic  simulations  were  performed  with  the  OOMMF  software \npackage [38].  Simulated  magnetization configurations  of  the  \u201con\u201d  and \u201coff\u201d  states  are  shown in \nFigures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. A cell size of 5 x 5 nm2 was used, while standard parameters were \nused to  represent  the  material  parameters  of  Ni80Fe20 (saturation magnetization,  MS =  860 kA\/m, \nexchange stiffness A = 13 pJ\/m, magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 = 0). \nBoth \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states were found to be stable at remanence. However, the \u201con\u201d state has a much  \nhigher energy (Etotal = 0.320 fJ) than the \u201coff\u201d state (Etotal = 0.077fJ). This is primarily due to the large \n5\nmagnetostatic energy of the \u201con\u201d state, resulting from the numerous DWs it contains. Consequently,  \nin dynamical simulations, a much larger field was required to switch the nanowire from the \u201coff\u201d state  \ninto the \u201con\u201d state (Hy = 1000 \u00b1 20 Oe) than was required to make the reverse transition (Hx = 60 \u00b1 20 \nOe). These results suggest that the \u201coff\u201d state is the nanowire\u2019s magnetic ground state, while the \u201con\u201d  \nstate  is  a  meta-stable  configuration  which  is  stabilized  by  the  localized  pinning  of  DWs.  A  \nconsequence of this is that localized defects are likely to enhance the reflectivity of the \u201con\u201d state by  \nensuring that the DWs are well pinned, such that the nanowires do not collapse spontaneously into the \nlower energy \u201coff\u201d state. In the simulations DW pinning is induced by edge roughness resulting from \nthe  discretization  of  the  nanowires  into  a  regular  mesh,  while  in  a  real  nanowire  array  both  \nlithographic and material defects would contribute.\nThe \u201con\u201d to \u201coff\u201d transition was found to proceed via the annihilation of adjacent H2H and T2T DWs \n(Figure  3(c)),  while  the  \u201coff\u201d  to  \u201con\u201d  transition occurred  via  the  nucleation of  DW pairs  in  the  \nsections of the nanowire where the magnetization was anti-parallel to the applied field (Figure 3(d)).  \nThis behavior is analogous to that of micrometer-scale ferromagnetic rings [39], structures to which \nthey are geometrically similar. The \u201con\u201d state is equivalent to the \u201conion\u201d state in the ring geometry,  \nwhile the \u201coff\u201d state is equivalent to the \u201cvortex\u201d state. It is possible that in a real nanowire array DW \npinning by random defects would increase the fields required to switch between \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states. \nHowever, it is highly unlikely that the fields required to obtain a perfect \u201coff\u201d state would exceed \nthose which are required to switch the mirror \u201con\u201d, and hence the presence of defects will have a \nnegligible effect on the feasibility of reconfiguring the mirror experimentally.\nExperimental   Technique \n 2 x 2 mm2 arrays of nanowires were patterned on Si\/SiO2 substrates using electron-beam lithography \nwith lift-off  processing.  To facilitate the fabrication of such large arrays,  which contained ~2000 \nindividual 2 mm long nanowires, each nanowire was written into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) \nresist  as  a  single  pixel  line  using an electron dose calibrated to  give the desired 125 nm width. \nMetallization with Ni80Fe20 was achieved by thermal evaporation with a base pressure ~10 -7 mbar. \nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fabricated nanowire array are presented in Figure  \n4(a).\nMagnetic hysteresis measurements of the nanowire arrays were performed using the Magneto-Optical  \nKerr  Effect  (MOKE).  Measurements  were  performed  in  the  transverse  geometry  with  applied \nmagnetic fields up to 2 kOe.\nQuantitative  imaging  of  the  magnetic  fields  produced  by  the  nanowire  arrays  was  achieved  by \nscanning Hall probe (SHP) microscopy at a temperature of 88 K. The Hall probe was aligned to  \nmeasure the out-of-plane component of the magnetic field (Hz), and had an active area of ~ 200 x 200 \n6\nnm, which limited the spatial resolution of the measurements.  The measurements were performed \nwith scan heights in excess of 700 nm to avoid damaging the probe through contact with dust particles  \nand residual resist on the sample\u2019s surface.\nMagnetic Character  ization  \nFigure 4(b)  presents a MOKE loop measured from the nanowire array with both applied field and \nmagnetization sensitivity along Hy. The array exhibits a double-stepped switching behavior indicating \nthat at least two distinct configurations were formed during its reversal. \nThe  high-magnetization  remanent  state,  which  is  formed  reversibly  from  positive  or  negative \nsaturation, is the \u201con\u201d state. We term the second state, which is formed following the application of a  \nsmall (< 100 Oe) reverse field the \u201cquasi-off\u201d (\u201cq-off\u201d) state. As we will show later,  this state is  \nsimilar to the \u201coff\u201d state in that the nanowires\u2019 magnetization is predominantly continuous; however,  \nhere each nanowire contains a few large domains, and consequently a small number of DWs. The \u201cq-\noff\u201d state is formed rather than the \u201coff\u201d state in this measurement because a uniaxial field sequence is  \nused to induce the array\u2019s  switching,  rather than the biaxial  sequence described earlier.  Domains  \npointing along the nanowires in directions +x and \u2013x are thus degenerate, unlike in the biaxial case  \nwhere the application of a field along Hx creates a unidirectional anisotropy.  Schematic diagrams of \nthe \u201con\u201d and \u201cq-off\u201d states are shown in Figure 4(b). \nThe micromagnetic simulations presented earlier indicate that the \u201con\u201d state is metastable. Therefore \nit is likely that some of the less strongly pinned DW pairs will annihilate spontaneously, reducing the  \natom mirror\u2019s reflectivity. To estimate the percentage of DW pairs present in the nanowire array\u2019s \nremanent state we differentiated the \u201con\u201d to \u201cq-off\u201d transitions and fitted Gaussian distributions to the \nresulting data (see inset to Figure 4(b)). Integrating these distributions then allowed the number of \nDW present at a given applied field to be calculated. Using this method we estimate that ~98 % of  \nDW pairs are stable at remanence. Spontaneous DW annihilation is therefore likely to have only a  \nsmall effect on the array\u2019s total reflectivity. However, it should be noted that over timescales longer  \nthan those of this measurement (~minutes) thermal excitation may cause further DW pairs to de-pin \nand annihilate. Therefore if the mirror is to be used for extended periods of time it may be necessary  \nto occasionally \u201creinforce\u201d its magnetic configuration by reapplying an external field.  \nIn Figure 5 we present SHP microscopy images which illustrate the switching of the nanowire array \nusing fields along both Hy (Figure 5(a)) and Hx (Figure 5(b)). In both cases the array was switched \ninitially into the \u201con\u201d state by applying briefly Hy ~ -1 kOe. Consequently, Figure 5(a) corresponds to \nthe application of a uniaxial field sequence (as in the MOKE data c.f. Figure 4b), while Figure 5(b)  \ncorresponds to a biaxial field sequence (as in the micromagnetic simulations c.f. Figure 3).  \n7\nThe SHP images of the nanowire array\u2019s remanent state exhibit a checkerboard pattern of light and \ndark regions, each of which corresponds to the position of a DW. Above H2H DWs Hz is positive, \nresulting in  light  contrast,  while  above T2T DWs Hz is  negative,  resulting in  dark contrast.  The \ncheckerboard patterns are unbroken in the absence of applied field indicating that all DW sites in the \nimaged area are filled. \nFigure 5(a) illustrates how the SHP images evolved in response to a  uniaxial field sequence. As the \napplied field is increased the regular checkerboard pattern becomes progressively disordered due to \nthe pair-wise annihilation of some DWs, and the isolated motion of others. In the final image, taken \nwith Hy= 360 Oe, there are a small number of well-separated DWs. The nanowires\u2019 magnetization is \ntherefore dominantly continuous, but is multi-domain over longer length-scales, as in the \u201cq-off\u201d state  \ndescribed earlier. Increasing the applied field to Hy ~ 750 Oe produced no further DW annihilation. \nThis is to be expected for the \u201cq-off\u201d state, where any remaining DWs are isolated from DWs with  \nopposite H2H or T2T character. \nFigure 5(b) illustrates how the nanowire array\u2019s switching behavior was altered when a biaxial field \nsequence was applied. As the field increases the checkerboard pattern once again becomes disordered. \nHowever, in contrast to the uniaxial switching images, DWs are only ever present in pairs, and no \nisolated DWs are observed in any of the images. At Hx = 91 Oe only two DW pairs are present, and \nthe  nanowires\u2019  magnetization  is  dominantly continuous  and single  domain.  Increasing  Hx  further \ncaused no additional changes in the images, most likely because the measurement was performed at  \n88 K, resulting in enhanced DW pinning over that at room temperature. However, had larger fields  \nbeen available and\/or the measurements  been performed at  room temperature it  is  likely that  the  \nremaining DW pairs would have annihilated,  forming a true \u201coff\u201d state.  The SHP data  therefore \nillustrates the importance of using a biaxial, rather than a uniaxial, field sequence to switch the atom \nmirror between the \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states.\nIn  Figure  6(a)  we  present  a  quantitative  comparison  between  a  SHP microscopy image  and  the \npredictions of the point-monopole model. As the scan height of the Hall probe was not known it was \ntreated as a free parameter and was optimized to produce good agreement with the measured values of \nHz. Using this method we calculated a scan height z = 780 nm. The finite size of the Hall probe was \ntaken into account at each point by averaging the predicted fields over a 200 nm x 200 nm area. \nIt can be seen that there is good agreement between the predictions of the point-monopole model and \nthe experimental data. This is illustrated further in Figure 6(b) in which we compare values of H z \nmeasured along the dashed lines in Figure 6(a). The differences between the two curves are caused by \na slight  disordering of the positions of the DWs in the SHP images.  This may be attributed to a \nrandom distribution of lithographic and material defects within the nanowires.\n8\nThe data shown in Figure 6 indicate that for z ~ 800 nm the point monopole model  provides an \nexcellent approximation of the nanowire array\u2019s magnetic field. However, this represents a far-field \ncase and in the experiment we propose atoms will approach much closer to the array\u2019s surface. At \nthese heights it is expected that the finite size and magnetization structure of the DWs will play a  \nmore important role in determining the magnetic field, and hence the point-monopole model will not \nbe such a good approximation. We will discuss these effects further in the following section.\nSimulated  Reflection Dynamics  \nIn this section we will calculate the behavior of a cloud of cold 87Rb atoms reflecting from the atom \nmirror,  thus  demonstrating  the  feasibility  of  using  our  design  in  initial  investigations  into  the \ninteraction  of  cold  atoms  with  DWs.  However,  before  presenting  these  simulations  we  will  first \npresent calculations which justify our methodology.\nAs  we  showed  above,  the  point-monopole  model  is  an  excellent  far-field  approximation  of  the \nmagnetic field created by the nanowire array. However, for  87Rb atoms in the 52S1\/2 F = 2, mF = 2 \nstate, dropped from z = 1 cm directly onto a DW, the same model predicts that reflection will occur at \nz ~ 450 nm where the finite size and magnetization structure of the DWs is likely to be important.\nTo investigate this we calculated the magnetic field pattern above a single DW using a micromagnetic  \nmodeling package that uses a hybrid finite element\/boundary element technique [40]. The parameters \nused to represent  Ni80Fe20 were the same as those used in the OOMMF simulations except  for a \nslightly lower value of Ms = 796 kA\/m.\n In these simulations we found that the DW had vortex structure (see inset Figure 7(a)) rather than \ntransverse structure as had been seen in the OOMMF simulations. We believe that this is in fact a \nbetter  representation of the DWs in the experimental  nanowires,  as evidenced by the small  steps \nproceeding to the \u201con\u201d to \u201cq-off\u201d transitions in the MOKE loop shown in Figure 4(b), which most \nlikely represents the  relaxation of a metastable  transverse  DW configuration into a lower energy \nvortex configuration. The transverse DW configurations in the OOMMF simulations are likely to be \nstabilized by the effective edge roughness of the rectangular finite difference mesh. \nIn Figure 7(a) we present simulated values of Hz as a function of z, directly above the centre of the \nDW. Also shown is a fit through the data using the point-monopole model with the magnetic charge, \nq, as a free parameter. It can be seen that there is excellent agreement between the simulated and point \nmonopole data. However the fitted value of q is 9 % lower than that calculated using Equation 6. We \nbelieve that this reflects the fact that at these heights the finite size of the DW\u2019s magnetic charge  \ndistribution reduces the gradient of the magnetic scalar potential with respect to the point-monopole  \nmodel. Nevertheless, the data indicate that the point-monopole model is a useful approximation, and \n9\nis suitable for use in this feasibility study. In an attempt to compensate for the effects of finite DW \nsize we use the reduced value of q in the following calculations.\nIn conventional  magnetic  mirror  designs the  magnetic  field above the mirror\u2019s  surface decays  as \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u221d\n\u03bb\npi z\ne\n2\nH where \u03bb is the wavelength of the mirror\u2019s periodic magnetization configuration [22].  \nConsequently an atom\u2019s interaction time with the mirror is extremely short and an atom\u2019s dynamics  \ncan  be  modeled  as  an  instantaneous,  specular  reflection  from  the  iso-field  surface  at  which\nreflectHH = . We will now demonstrate that a similar approach is well suited to the atom mirror  \ndesign we propose.\nIn Figure 7(b) we present a log-linear plot of H as a function of z as calculated for our atom mirror \ndesign using the point-monopole model. Data are shown for positions ( x \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm, z ), where x = \n50 \u03bcm \u2192 ( 50 + 0.8d ) \u03bcm (see inset figure). We choose to evaluate data along this line because at x = \n(  50 +  d  )  \u03bcm the symmetry  of  the  magnetic  charge distribution indicates  that  ( )zH = 0,  and \ntherefore we might expect to see \u201csoftening\u201d of the magnetic field gradients as we approach this point.\nFor all values of x the plots retain a high degree of linearity up to  reflectH . Fitting in this region \nproduces \u03bb = 0.950 \u00b1 0.006 \u03bcm, close to the array\u2019s actual 1 \u03bcm wavelength. The small deviation from \nthe  expected  value  is  most  likely  due  to  the  presence  of  higher  harmonics  in  the  mirror\u2019s  \nmagnetization  configuration,  as  will  be  explored  in  more  detail  later.  Because  H decays \nexponentially  as  in  conventional  magnetic  mirror  designs,  modeling  an  atom\u2019s  dynamics  as  an \ninstantaneous reflection from the  reflectH  iso-field surface is a valid approach for the system we \nconsider.\nIn Figure 8(a) we present the geometry of the  reflectH iso-field surface calculated using the point-\nmonopole model. Data are shown for a 5 \u03bcm x 5 \u03bcm region close to the centre of the nanowire array.  \nA more detailed plot of the array\u2019s  central unit cell is also shown as an inset to Figure 8(b). The  \nnominally spherical iso-field surfaces surrounding each of the DWs have merged together to form a \ncontinuous surface, however, a significant amount of curvature is still evident, such that the atom \nmirror\u2019s surface has a finite \u201croughness\u201d. This is illustrated further in Figure 8(b), which presents the \ndistribution of angles the field surface makes to the horizontal within the unit cell. Experimentally, the  \nmirror\u2019s roughness will mean that an atom cloud will be diffusely reflected. The field surface is also \n\u201cporous\u201d,  containing  non-reflecting  regions  centered  on  the  symmetry  points  described  earlier, \n10\nhowever we calculate that 97 % of the surface area of the unit cell is covered by fields in excess of  \nreflectH , and therefore the porosity in itself should only have a minor effect on the reflectivity of the \nmirror.  \nIn Figure 9 we present calculated reflection dynamics for  87Rb atoms dropped onto the array\u2019s unit \ncell at normal incidence from a height of 1 cm. The atoms are modeled at 0 K so as to isolate their  \nintrinsic dispersion from that due to thermal effects. As would be expected from the histogram shown \nin Figure 8(b), the atoms are reflected diffusely with the greatest number of atoms having trajectories  \nat ~ 40\u00b0 to the vertical. \nTo  assess  the  suitability  of  measuring  the  atom\u2019s  reflection  experimentally  we  define  an \n\u201cexperimentally accessible\u201d region into which a laser light sheet could be inserted to detect the atom\u2019s  \nmotion by resonant absorption. We define this region as being 2.5-7.5 mm above the surface of the  \nnanowire array. It can be seen that the majority of the reflected atoms pass through the experimentally \naccessible region within 20 ms of leaving the surface of the mirror.  This result  demonstrates the  \nfeasibility  of  detecting  the atom\u2019s  motion  experimentally,  and  indicates  that  the  atom mirror  we \npropose is suitable for investigating interactions between domain walls and cold atoms.     \nIt is also likely that our simple theoretical treatment overestimates the roughness of the reflectH field \nsurface. In the point-monopole model the nanowires\u2019 magnetic charge distribution is described by a \n2D array of delta functions in both real and Fourier space. The model\u2019s charge distribution therefore \ncontains a vast number of high frequency harmonics which contribute to the atom mirrors roughness.  \nIn reality the DWs have finite widths and hence higher frequency components will be less significant.  \nThe effect of this will be a smoothing of the reflectH field surface in comparison to that predicted by \nthe point-monopole model.\nConclusions\nIn  this  paper  we  have  described  the  design,  fabrication  and characterization  of  a  reconfigurable \nnanomagnetic atom mirror which will be used in initial investigations into the interactions between \nDWs and cold atoms.  The atom mirror  is  formed by the magnetic  field emanating from a large \nnumber of 180\u00b0 DWs confined within a periodic array of undulating planar magnetic nanowires. \nWe have demonstrated the fabrication of a nanowire array which will be large enough to be used to \nexperimentally investigate the \u201cbouncing\u201d of an atom cloud upon the mirror under gravity. Magnetic  \ncharacterization of the mirror indicates that ~98 % of potential DW sites in the array are filled at  \nremanence, and also allowed us to show how the mobility of the DWs permits the atom mirror to be \n11\nswitched \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d using biaxial magnetic field sequences. We have also modeled the dynamics \nof 87Rb atoms reflecting from the atom mirror\u2019s surface. Our results indicate that although the mirror\u2019s \nsurface exhibits substantial roughness, the atoms\u2019 reflections will be sufficiently well defined to allow \nexperimental probing of their dynamics.\nCumulatively, the results of this study indicate that the atom mirror design we propose will be an ideal \nsystem with  which  to  perform initial  investigations  into  manipulating  cold  atoms  using  DWs in \nferromagnetic nanowires. In addition to providing a system that will allow interactions to be observed \nover length-scales that are easily accessible experimentally, it will also allow us to demonstrate the  \nreconfigurability intrinsic to atom optics\/atom traps formed by magnetic nanostructures composed of \nsoft ferromagnetic materials.\nFuture studies will focus on an experimental realization of the atom bouncing experiment we have \nmodeled in this paper. This in turn will inform experiments in which we will attempt to achieve our  \nultimate goal of trapping a single atom in the potential well created by a DW. Nanowire arrays with  \ngeometries similar to that which we have investigated in this paper could ultimately be used to create \ntwo dimensional arrays of magnetic traps, which have been shown to be useful tools for studying \nphenomena such as Josephson oscillations [41] and Mott insulator transitions [42] in atomic \nensembles.  \nThe authors  thank the Engineering and Physical  Sciences  Research Council  for  financial  support \n(grant Nos.

Data are shown for positions ( x \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm, z ), where x = 50 \n\u03bcm (closed squares), 50 + 0.2d \u03bcm (closed circles), 50 + 0.4d \u03bcm (closed triangles), 50 + 0.6d \u03bcm  \n(open squares) and 50 + 0.8d \u03bcm (open circles).\n15\nFigure 8: (a) Geometry of the  reflectH iso-field surface calculated using the point-monopole model. \n(b) Distribution of angles of the reflectH  iso-field surface makes to the horizontal within the central \nunit cell of atom mirror. A detailed plot of the reflectH  iso-field surface in the unit cell is shown inset. \nFigure 9:  Calculated dynamics of  87Rb atoms reflecting from the central unit cell atom mirror. The \natoms are positions are shown as a function of their height above the mirrors surface, z, and their  \nradial displacement in the plane of the substrate, r.   The density of the reflected atoms is indicated by \ngrayscale contrast. Data are shown (a) 5 ms, (b) 10 ms, (c) 15 ms and (d) 20 ms after the atoms leave  \nthe surface of the mirror. The dashed lines indicate an \u201cexperimentally accessible\u201d region into which a \nlight sheet could be inserted to experimentally measure the atoms\u2019 dynamics.   \n \n16\nFigure 1\n17\nFigure 2\nFigure 3\n18\nFigure 4\n19\nFigure 5\n20\nFigure 6\nFigure 7\n21\nFigure 8\nFigure 9\n22\n"}
