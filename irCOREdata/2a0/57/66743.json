Introduction \nIsolated, autonomous electrical power systems are often found in process industry, for example in \nan iron and steel or petrochemical complex. Grid connection may be too costly such as on offshore \noil rigs or the grid may not be able to provide the quality and reliability of supply required by the \nindustrial customer. The design and operation of isolated, autonomous power systems have to \naddress technical issues that are not common to conventional substations connected to the utility \ngrid. For instance, the short circuit level can be high due to low impedance and local generation \n 2\npresent in the system. Because both generators and loads are distributed to separate busbars, control \nof load voltages may conflict with the desired sharing of reactive power between generators \ninvolving VAr flow through impedance branches. Such issues are considered in design but must be \ndealt with during operation, usually by a computerised power management system (PMS) which \nalso provides other control, monitoring and protection functions [1].  \n \nFigure 1 shows in general a power management system providing supervisory control in a stand \nalone industry power system. Load busbar voltages, system frequency and the operating conditions \nof the generators are acquired and used to activate switching actions, and set references for \ngenerator AVRs, governors and the tap positions of some transformers that can be changed on-load. \nThe control objectives of the power management system are to satisfy the load voltage and \nfrequency requirements while maintaining power system components within specifications. \n \nAchieving control objectives using a PMS requires understanding of the system behaviour subject \nto disturbances and control actions.  It is important to form an overall control strategy regarding the \nrequirements. The strategy is then verified and detailed towards implementation. This paper \npresents a simulation study performed as part of such a development procedure.  \n \nEach industrial power system has its own characteristics. This study focuses on the voltage and \nreactive power control in a system found in the petrochemical industry and it is the control \nrequirements caused by the expansion of an existing system that are considered. In the expanded \nsystem, inter-bus transformers (IBTs) between local substations will be used to limit potential fault \ncurrent. Sharing of load reactive power according to generator MVA ratings is desired to maximize \nthe margin of AVR response when regulating the local load busbar voltage in fast transients. \nTransformer impedance and reactive power flow give rise to the inherent conflict of trying to \nachieve voltage and reactive power control simultaneously. In addition to generator AVR, a \nminimum number of on-load tap changes (OLTC) to the IBTs are required. This paper investigates \n 3\nhow such control means can be used within a PMS to achieve the control objectives.  \n \nThe model components used in this study are not themselves original. The contribution of this paper \nis to illustrate the origin of the power system control requirements and put forward a coordinated \nAVR and OLTC control strategy. Analysis, backed by simulation results, shows how to achieve the \ncontrol objectives in a PMS. The study provides new insight and ideas that can be useful to the \ndesign of future industrial power systems and their PMS. \n \n2. Power System and Control Requirements \nThe existing power system is simplified as shown in Figure 2. It consists of two substations which \nare linked at 33 kV voltage level through a short cable run with a circuit breaker at each end. Each \nsubstation has generators and loads connected to the 33 kV busbar. The local generation capacity \nand load power are in the range of 60 MVA to 180 MVA, and are detailed in the Appendix. \nSignificant reactive power is demanded by loads of an industrial nature, e.g. induction motors and \nthyristor converters or variable speed drives. The frequency of the system is maintained by the \ngovernors of all the generators operating in droop mode. Since the loads are all supplied from the \ntwo 33 kV busbars which are directly connected, all generators can share the responsibility of load \nbus voltage regulation. The load reactive power can be shared according to generator MVA ratings \nby means of \u2018q-axis droop\u2019 [2]. \n \nAs industrial production increases, there is the need to increase the generation capacity. If new \ngenerators were added to the two existing substations, this would cause the short circuit level to \nexceed the interrupting capabilities of the circuit breakers in the system. A highly inductive circuit \nis associated with a high peak make duty due to the large d.c. offset which takes long time to decay. \nAs a result, it was decided to build a new substation associated with the new production line or load, \nshown as SS3 in Figure 3. The original interconnection between Substations SS1 and SS2 is broken \nup and the three substations are all linked to a 132 kV busbar through three pairs of inter-bus \n 4\ntransformers with large impedance to limit the fault current. If a short circuit fault occurs in any part \nof the system, the fault current fed by at least two substations will be limited by some of the IBTs. \nThe tap positions on the high voltage side of the IBTs can be changed on-load. If two IBTs in a \nsubstation are both on line, their tap positions are always the same and changed together to avoid \ncirculating current. The configuration shown in Figure 3 is an option that can be adopted in other \ndesigns in the future. Real parameters of Substation SS3 and the identical inter-bus transformers are \nalso given in the Appendix, as for Substations SS1 and SS2. \n \nEach substation can include different types of generators and each generator is equipped with an \nAVR. The AVR regulates the 11 kV terminal voltage. However the AVR reference is set by the \nPMS according to the corresponding 33 kV load busbar voltage, as illustrated in the next section. \n \nSharing the load reactive power between the generators means flow of reactive, as well as real, \npower in reversible direction through the IBTs, which is permitted in this configuration. The special \nrequirements on the tap changing mechanism to allow reversible power flow are discussed in [3]. \nThis however causes significant voltage drops across the relatively large IBT impedance. The load \nvoltages at the 33 kV busbars are consequently affected. It is necessary to use the on-load tap \nchanging function of the IBTs and the AVRs of the generators together to achieve the load voltage \ncontrol and reactive power sharing between the generators, requiring a coordinated control strategy. \nThe development and validation of such a strategy are the principle aims of this study. \n \nThe load voltages are to be controlled within  1% of the nominal value (33 kV). The 132 kV busbar \nvoltage is also to be controlled within a  5% tolerance. The IBT tap ratio can be changed in either \nthe positive or negative direction by 8 steps, each moving further away from the nominal tap by \n1.25%. Tap changing relies on mechanisms that are slow and can wear out after extensive use. \nTherefore a control objective is to reduce the number of tap changes for a given scenario of \ndisturbance. Since IBT tap positions are discrete, there is the risk of hunting in which the tap \n 5\noscillates between two positions. This must be avoided by appropriate design. \n \n3. Control Strategy \nIn order to understand the proposed control strategy it is necessary to point out that the autonomous \nindustrial system concerned is subject to a different set of constraints and control options to those \nexperienced by public distribution networks. This is primarily because public distribution networks \nhave load customers directly connected to them and often they do not have local generation and \ntherefore reactive power sharing between distributed generators is not an issue. The autonomous \nindustrial system concerned has specific control facilities available, such as, access to local \ngenerator AVR. This control facility is often unavailable in public distribution networks where local \nvoltage regulation is likely to be achieved using AVC relays [4] or in some circumstances static \nVAr compensators. This study investigates the feasibility of a new control strategy using generator \nAVR and OLTC of the IBTs, which if successful will be cost effective as no additional hardware is \nrequired. The control specifications of an autonomous industrial system as described in this paper \nare also different from those in a public distribution network [5]. \n \nThe generator AVR operates in a continuous manner to adjust the excitation, which will in turn \naffect the terminal voltage and the reactive power produced by the generator.  Given the IBT tap \npositions, the fast response of the AVR is utilized to ensure the quality of load voltage control. The \n 1% voltage variation permitted on the 33 kV busbars can however be used as the first means of \nreactive power sharing control. This is shown in Figure 4 for any of the three substations. The \nreference of the 33 kV load busbar voltage is set in the tolerance band so that it will reduce the \ndifference between the VAr sharing of the substation, in terms of MVAr per MVA of generator \ncapacity, and that of the overall system. The VAr controller shown in Figure 4 which sets the \nreference value of the corresponding 33 kV busbar voltage is driven by the following error. \n \n 6\nsubstationoverall\nMVA\nMVAr\nMVA\nMVAr\nQ )()( !\"#                                                                                             (1) \n \nwhere the generated MVAr is measured on the 33 kV side of the substation.  \n \nThe voltage regulator shown in Figure 4 responds to the 33 kV busbar voltage error and sets the \ndemand for the generator AVR to regulate its terminal voltage (11 kV). Both the VAr regulator and \nvoltage regulator can be implemented in proportional and integral algorithms that will eliminate any \nsteady state error and the 33 kV load busbar voltage will be kept in the  1% tolerance band. \n \nAs described above, the tap positions of the IBTs can be controlled to achieve two objectives: \n- to maintain the 132 kV busbar voltage within  5% of the nominal value, and \n- to drive, in a differential mode, the reactive power towards equal sharing according to the \ngenerator MVA capacities of the substations. \n \nIt is noted that the system is off grid so load customers are not affected in the same way as in grid \nconnection. The major factors determining the voltage tolerance band of the 132 kV busbar where \nno load is connected are the equipment voltage ratings rather than customer requirements [5]. \n \nA control loop would be required in the PMS that controls the IBT taps in order to maintain the \nvoltage at a particular 33 kV substation where the local generation is off line. This control mode \nregarding the local load fed from generators in the other two substations through IBTs is \nconventional for transformer fed substations and therefore has not been included in this study. As \non-load tap changing of an IBT is much slower than the response of the generator AVR, it is desired \nthat tap changing control is only enabled and executed when the AVR response has reached the \nsteady state. In the simulation model, this is taken into account by introducing time delays in the tap \nchanging control algorithm, as described later. Following the change of a tap position, further AVR \n 7\nresponse would be activated. Through the combined use of generator AVR and IBT on-load tap \nchanging, the 33 kV busbar voltages will remain within the  1% tolerance band while in the steady \nstate the total load reactive power will be shared by the three substations according to their \ngenerator MVA capacities. In the steady state, the 33 kV busbar voltages are largely determined by \nIBT taps. \n \nFigure 5 shows the structure of the control logic for the IBT tap positions. The error of the 132 kV \nbusbar voltage and\/or the unequal reactive power sharing between substations are detected and used \nto drive the tap positions moving in the desired directions, resulting in reduction of the errors. As \nshown in the figure, the movement of a tap in an IBT is the result of two actions which aim to \nregulate the 132 kV busbar voltage and equalize the generator reactive power according to the \nMVA rating. The 132 kV busbar voltage drives a common mode motion in which all IBTs move \ntheir taps in the same direction. The unequal reactive power sharing between the substations drives \nthe tap positions to change in a differential mode. Based on the relationship in the power system, \nthe control logic should satisfy the following conditions, which has been represented using proper \nsigns in Figure 5. \n \n- If the 132 kV busbar voltage is lower than the tolerance band, the control tends to increase \nthe tap positions of all IBTs and vice versa. \n- If the reactive power from a substation is to be decreased, this requires the tap position of the \nIBTs in the corresponding substation to be reduced and vice versa. \n \nIn these statements, increasing the tap position means that the number of turns on the high voltage \n(132 kV) side of the IBT becomes larger. \n \nIt is important to set appropriate tolerance bands for the common and differential modes of the tap \nposition control algorithms. While the voltage tolerance band is set as  5% of the nominal, the \n 8\ntolerance band for reactive power sharing must consider the discrete nature of the tap positions and \nthis should be set to avoid a hunting scenario in which the tap keeps moving between two positions.  \n \nFigure 6 shows the equivalent circuit of the system shown in Figure 3 with all reactances referred to \nthe 132 kV side. XSS1, XSS2 and XSS3 are the reactances of Substations SS1, SS2 and SS3 \nrespectively, each including the generators (using synchronous reactance) and the 11 kV\/33 kV \nstep-up transformers.  XT1, XT2 and XT3 are the equivalent reactances of the parallel IBTs in the \nthree substations. The off nominal tap positions of the IBTs are represented using ideal transformers \nwhich can then have non-unity ratios. The load impedances are ignored. It can be shown that the \nchange of reactive power caused by 1.25% of IBT ratio variation in one substation, measured at the \nlocal 33 kV busbar can be calculated as \n \n)\/\/()()(\n132)1320125.0(\n332211\n1\nTSSTSSTSS\nSS\nXXXXXX\nkVkV\nQ\n$$$$\n%%\n\"#                                                                  (2) \n)\/\/()()(\n132)1320125.0(\n331122\n2\nTSSTSSTSS\nSS\nXXXXXX\nkVkV\nQ\n$$$$\n%%\n\"#                                                                     (3) \n)\/\/()()(\n132)1320125.0(\n112233\n3\nTSSTSSTSS\nSS\nXXXXXX\nkVkV\nQ\n$$$$\n%%\n\"#                                                                     (4) \n \nwhere expressions in the form of 21 \/\/ XX  means the parallel equivalent of 1X  and 2X , i.e. \n)\/( 2121 XXXX $ . \n \nIt is apparent that the change of reactive power caused by one step of IBT tap position depends on \nthe operational condition of the system, with maximum sensitivities occurring at lowest impedances \nin the circuit, i.e. when all the generators and transformers are in operation. From the impedance \ndata given in the Appendix, the maximum change of the reactive power caused by a single tap \nchange of IBTs as measured in the corresponding substations are  \n 9\nMVArQSS 86.2max_1 \"#  \nMVArQSS 87.2max_2 \"#  \nMVArQSS 06.3max_3 \"#  \n \nThe tolerance band in IBT tap position control for reactive power sharing must be greater than the \nmaximum of these values. To provide sufficient margin, a band has been set to be  6 MVAr and \nthis has been taken into account in terms of the MVAr\/MVA calculation which drives the \ndifferential mode of tap position control as shown in Figure 5. \n \n4. Simulation Models \nSynchronous generators are usually modelled in two alternative approaches: 1) an equivalent circuit \nmodel using a constant e.m.f. behind the synchronous or transient reactance; 2) a full model \nincluding stator and rotor windings with coupling which governs the development of e.m.f. and \ntorque of the machine [6]. It was discovered in initial simulations that the first approach is \noversimplified and the voltage dip or rise in the system following a major disturbance predicted \nusing synchronous reactance is excessive. It is necessary to use a transient model in which the \ntransient reactance is significantly lower than the synchronous reactance. The second approach is \ncomputationally intensive in the present study where many generators are included and the \ntransients concerned last for minutes rather than seconds. \n \nIf a conventional transient model were used, e.g. a constant transient e.m.f., E\u2019, behind the transient \nreactance, it would not allow investigation into the response of the excitation voltage which is \ndictated by the AVR output. In the present study, it is essential to guarantee that the AVR and \nexciter outputs will be within the limits. Furthermore, a conventional transient model would cause \nthe reactive power flow in the system to be more sensitive than it is to the change of IBT tap \nposition since the circuit reactance is too low. \n 10\nThe adopted transient generator model is shown in Figure 7 as an equivalent circuit. It appears \nsimilar to a conventional transient model. However, the transient e.m.f. is not constant as \ndetermined by the pre-event load flow condition. Instead, E\u2019 is dynamically updated during the \ntransient. The updating algorithm is given below in Eq. (5) [7], and depends on the exciter output \nand the reactive component of the generator output current. As a result, the model is able to \nrepresent the AVR or exciter limits and the steady state response of the reactive power will be that \ndetermined by the excitation voltage Ef and synchronous reactance. \n \n)( '''' XXIEEE\ndt\nd\nT dfdo !!!\"                                                                                                    (5) \n \nwhere 'doT  is the open circuit transient time constant. X and X\u2019 are the synchronous and transient \nreactances of the generator, taking the average of d and q axis values as an approximation. \n \nThe AVR modelled conforms to an IEEE Type II standard [8]. The output limits of the main \nregulator are [-39, 40 pu] while the output of the exciter is limited to [0, 4.7 pu]. Actual control \nblock gains and time constants are used which are also typical as for a 40-50 MVA generator.  \n \nThe generator transformers are modelled in terms of the winding leakage reactance and resistance, \nand the mutual coupling between the primary and secondary windings.  The inter-bus transformers \nfurther feature on-load tap changing. Each IBT is then modelled as a conventional transformer with \nnominal ratio in cascade with an ideal transformer having the off nominal ratio 1:a where \u2018a\u2019 is \nadjustable [9] from the controller point of view.  \n \nThe control algorithms, as outlined in Figures 4 and 5, are implemented in a coordinated manner as \nthey would be in a PMS. The generator excitation control is executed continuously while the IBT \nOLTC control is modelled as described in [10]. The time scale for updating the local AVR settings \n 11\nis short (20 ms) while the tap positions are changed in a time scale up to 10 seconds. \n \nIn order to avoid unnecessary tap changes, the IBT tap control logic is blocked for 10 seconds after \nthe disturbance. This allows the AVR response, which is automatically initiated and typically has a \ndecaying time constant of 2~3 seconds [11], to settle down. Once the tap position is set, it is held \nthere for at least 10 seconds before the next change of tap position can take place. For example, in \nline with Figure 5, Figure 8 expands the control logic that the IBT tap position in a substation \nchanges to balance reactive power sharing in the overall system. This corresponds to a differential \nmode component in Figure 5. The input on the left hand side is the deviation of reactive power \nsharing (per MVA) as calculated in Eq. (1). In the simulated cases which will be described in the \nnext section, the control logic is manually blocked for 10 seconds following the occurrence of the \ndisturbance. In practice, the power management system would detect the initial transient of a \ndisturbance. Alternatively the \u2018d\/dt\u2019 rate in the AVR response would be measured to check whether \na new steady state has been reached. Time delay and logic comparison can be used jointly to define \nthe holding time for the set tap position. \n \nIt is clear that the IBT tap position control logic described here can be modified to include the \nreactive power constraint imposed by the generator performance chart. This has been considered in \nthe simulated cases. \n \n5. Case Studies \nTwo representative disturbances are considered in this section using real system parameters. One \ncauses long term effect to the system while the other has temporary effect during transient. The first \ncase study investigates the system response following an incident of tripping a heavily loaded \ngenerator. This will cause the distribution of real and reactive power in the system to change. \nSimulations show how the PMS achieves the control objectives of maintaining the load busbar \nvoltages and sharing of load reactive power according to generator MVA capacities. \n 12\nBefore the disturbance, all generators in Substations SS2 and SS3 are in operation. In Substation \nSS1 one generator has already been shut down.  A further generator is tripped at SS1 at t=80 s in the \nsimulated response shown below. It is assumed that every substation has only one inter-bus \ntransformer in operation. \n \nFigure 9 shows the real power from generators in the three substations. The lost generator power is \npicked up by all the remaining generators in the system according to the governor droop \ncharacteristics. Figure 10 shows the voltage amplitude at the 33 kV busbars of the three substations. \nThe voltages all drop with the maximum dip occurring in SS1 where the tripped generator was \nconnected. The AVRs of all generators respond to the voltage decrease and it takes 5-10 seconds for \nall the 33 kV busbar voltages to return to the  1% tolerance band around the nominal value (33 kV, \nwhich is used as the base voltage for the per unit value).  \n \nThe changes to the generator excitation also cause the reactive power output of the generators to \nchange, as shown in Figure 11. The remaining generator in Substation SS1 initially produces more \nreactive power as its excitation increases in response to the 33 kV busbar voltage dip. After the \ndelay of 10 seconds, the PMS instigates the first tap change of IBTs in order to begin rebalancing of \nthe reactive power sharing. The change of IBT tap positions is plotted in Figure 12. The reactive \npower of the remaining generator in Substation SS1 is above the limit (30 MVAr) for about 50 \nseconds. This is regarded as acceptable after checking the transient thermal capability of the \ngenerator. If necessary, the process of rebalancing the generator reactive power can be accelerated \nupon detecting the violation of the steady state performance chart regarding reactive power. \n \nThe second case studied is direct-on-line starting (with no load) of a 6 MVA induction motor which \nis fed from the 33 kV busbar of Substation SS2 through a 33 kV\/11 kV step-down transformer \nhaving a leakage reactance of 0.1 pu. Typical parameters are used also for the induction motor in \nthis study. All generators in Substations SS1 and SS3 are in operation but only one is in Substation \n 13\nSS2. SS1 and SS3 each has an IBT on-line while SS2 has two to allow power to be imported from \nSubstations SS1 and SS3. Figure 13 shows the response of 33 kV busbar voltages. The disturbance \nis again applied at t=80 s.  \n \nIt is observed that voltage dips are caused due to the large reactive current drawn by the motor \nduring start up. The voltage recovers and overshoots when the start up is over. Figure 14 shows that \nthe generator AVRs respond to the voltage variations and the excitation voltage of the generator in \nSubstation SS2 reached upper limit (4.7 pu). Figure 15 shows the response of the generator reactive \npower in the three substations, driven by the AVRs. This has the effect to attenuate the voltage \nvariations on the load busbars as shown in Figure 13. The time delay and tolerance band in the IBT \ntap control algorithms are set to avoid any unnecessary change of tap as implied by the results \nshown in Figure 16. \n  \nThe 132 kV busbar voltage remains very stiff in all cases studied. Loads on the 33 kV busbars \nconsist of induction motors and variable speed drives for gas compressors and pumps which can \nride through the voltage disturbances shown in the simulation results [5]. \n \n6. Conclusion \nThis paper has described the requirements of voltage and reactive power control in an industrial \npower system subject to expansion. A control strategy is developed which achieves the target \ncontrol requirements. Time domain simulations demonstrate that coordinated control of generator \nAVRs and on-load tap changing of inter-bus transformers can be used to keep the load busbar \nvoltages within the tolerance band of  1% around the nominal value while the load reactive power \nis shared by generators according to their MVA ratings even subject to disturbances. A control \ntolerance of  6 MVAr for a substation is determined to prevent the tap from hunting between \ndifferent positions. Simulations verify the PMS supervisory control strategy which is shown to be \nsuitable for the particular system. The methods outlined in this paper can also be applied to other \n 14\nindustrial systems where the PMS must control the voltage via both AVRs and IBT tap changers. \n \n7.
