Such claims suggest that maintaining or \nswitching the tonality of a musical selection between information encoding and \nretrieval should promote robust \u201cmood-mediated\u201d context-dependent memory (CDM) \neffects. The reported experiment examined this hypothesis using versions of a Chopin \nwaltz where the key was either reinstated or switched at retrieval, so producing minor-\n-minor, major--major, minor--major and major--minor conditions. Better word recall \narose in reinstated-key conditions (particularly for the minor--minor group) than in \nswitched-key conditions, supporting the existence of tonality-based CDM effects. The \ntonalities also induced different mood states. The minor key induced a more negative \nmood than the major key, and participants in switched-key conditions demonstrated \nswitched moods between learning and recall. Despite the association between music \ntonality and mood, a path analysis failed to reveal a reliable mood-mediation effect. \nWe discuss why mood-mediated CDM may have failed to emerge in this study, whilst \nalso acknowledging that an alternative \u201cmental-context\u201d account can explain our \nresults (i.e., the mental representation of music tonality may act as a contextual cue \nthat elicits information retrieval). \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  3\nMusic Tonality and Context-Dependent Recall:  \nThe Influence of Key Change and Mood Mediation \n Context-dependent memory (CDM) refers to the phenomenon whereby a  \nchange in context between information learning and retrieval causes some of the \noriginally encoded information to be forgotten. Much laboratory-based experimental \nresearch has investigated which aspects of a prevailing context can provide successful \nretrieval cues when reinstated -- as opposed to being switched -- between information \nencoding and subsequent testing. Evidence has shown that a wide range of contexts, \nboth external (i.e., environmental) and internal (i.e., mental), can produce CDM \neffects on recall with a good degree of reliability. Such contexts include olfactory \nstimuli (e.g., Cann & Ross, 1989; Parker, Ngu, & Cassaday, 2001; Schab, 1990), \ngeneral physical location (e.g., Godden & Baddeley, 1975; Isarida & Isarida, 2004; \nSmith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978); time of day (e.g., Holloway, 1978); drug or alcohol \nstates (e.g., Eich, 1980); mood states (e.g., Eich, Macauley, & Ryan, 1994; Eich & \nMetcalfe, 1989) and ambient music (e.g., Balch, Bowman, & Mohler, 1992; Smith, \n1985). It is the claim that background  music can act as a potent environmental CDM \ncue that forms the focus of the present study, with a specific issue being the role of \nmusic tonality in promoting CDM effects on recall. Before we overview the detailed \naims of our study we first review existing research on musical CDM effects. \nIn his pioneering study of music-based CDM, Smith (1985) presented \nparticipants with words in one of three different contexts: a jazz selection, a classical \nselection, or with no music present. Smith observed a CDM effect when reinstating a \nmusic context (but not a quiet context) for word recall 48 hr after encoding. Although \nswitched-music contexts revealed worse performance than music-reinstated contexts, \nmusic switching did not, in fact, hamper recall compared to either the quietness-\n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  4\nreinstated condition or the music then quiet conditions. These latter findings indicated \nthat music mismatches did not cause distraction at recall. \nBalch, Bowman, and Mohler (1992, Experiment 1) found no music-dependent \nmemory effects for delayed recall (after a 48 hr interval), but for immediate recall it \nwas observed that reinstated-music conditions produced reliably better performance \nthan switched-music conditions, indicating a CDM effect. Music reinstatement, \nhowever, showed no memory facilitation relative to a no-cue condition, although the \nlinear trend in recall scores across the three ordered means (i.e., switched music < no \ncue < reinstated music) was reliable, suggesting switched conditions inhibited recall \nwhilst reinstated conditions facilitated recall. Balch et al. (1992, Experiment 2) also \nobserved that when the musical selections were switched in either tempo (fast vs. \nslow) or form (classical vs. jazz) it was only those pieces having an altered tempo that \nproduced reliably lower immediate recall compared with reinstated pieces.  \nBalch and Lewis (1996) noted a problem with the methodology that Balch et \nal. (1992) had used to investigate tempo-dependent memory, which was that different \nmusical selections had been employed in the switched-tempo conditions. This meant \nthat switched conditions were potentially changed on multiple dimensions, including \ninstrument timbres, melodic phrases, and harmonic sequences. Altering contexts \nalong multiple dimensions may promote stronger CDM effects (e.g., Dalton, 1993; \nEich, Macauley, & Ryan, 1994; Tulving, 1983) and also confuses the interpretation of \nwhat manipulations may be sufficient causes of CDM. Balch and Lewis (1996, \nExperiments 1 and 2) therefore tested music-dependent memory by including \nconditions that reinstated or changed the tempo (slow vs. fast) or reinstated or \nchanged the timbre (piano vs. brass) of the same musical piece. Evidence supported \nthe existence of tempo-dependent memory (more words recalled in reinstated-tempo \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  5\nvs. switched-tempo conditions) but not timbre-dependent memory (no reduction in \nrecall for switched-timbre vs. same-timbre conditions).  \nIn follow-up experiments, Balch and Lewis (1996, Experiments 3 and 4) \nexamined the specific question of why changes in music tempo induce CDM effects. \nThey hypothesised that alterations in tempo might induce changes in mood, and that it \nis such mood changes that underpin music-dependent memory. To assess this \u201cmood-\nmediation hypothesis\u201d (cf.  Eich, 1995a), Balch and Lewis (Experiment 3) ran an \ninitial study to determine the effects of three music variables \u2013 tempo (slow vs. fast), \ntimbre (piano vs. brass), and musical selection (classical vs. jazz) \u2013 on people\u2019s mood \nstates, as measured by eliciting mood ratings from participants on the dimensions of \narousal and pleasantness. The only music variable that was significantly related to \nmood ratings was tempo. Moreover, tempo was observed to influence the arousal \ndimension of mood (with the fast tempo being more arousing), but not the \npleasantness dimension.  \nHaving established a relation between tempo and mood, Balch and Lewis \n(Experiment 4) went on to examine how this relation influenced memory. Participants \nlearnt and recalled words in the same moods or in switched moods. The mood states \nin the learning phase were induced by different music tempos (slow vs. fast). In the \nretrieval phase mood states were induced by verbal instructions and a spoken mood-\ninducing scenario. Recall was found to be higher in mood contexts at retrieval that \nwere consistent with a previous tempo versus mood contexts inconsistent with a \nprevious tempo. These results support a view of music-dependent memory as being \nmediated by mood changes, as predicted by Eich\u2019s (e.g., 1995a) mood-mediation \nhypothesis. An alternative to the mood-mediation account of CDM is the \u201cmental-\ncontext hypothesis\u201d (Smith, 1995; Tulving, 1983), which proposes that mental context \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  6\ncan be broadly construed to include many factors (e.g., mood, place, mental set) and \nthat any of these can cause context-dependent retrieval when reinstated (or, \nalternatively, context-dependent forgetting when switched). Balch and Lewis (1996), \nhowever, argue that whilst their tempo manipulation is a sufficient cause for music-\ndependent memory, they were unable to induce CDM effects with other contextual \nchanges associated with music. As such, their results provide little evidence that \nmusic-dependent memory can have multiple causes, as predicted by Smith\u2019s (1995) \nmental-context hypothesis. \nThe starting point for our own research is the assumption that the mood-\nmediation hypothesis is generally capable of explaining a wealth of data (including \ninconsistent findings across studies) relating to CDM (cf. Balch & Lewis, 1996; Eich, \n1995b). For example, notable failures in finding CDM effects (e.g., Fenandez & \nGlenberg, 1985) may well be associated with failures of the different contexts to \npromote sufficiently distinctive mood or arousal states (Eich, 1995a). We also concur \nwith Balch and Lewis (1996), who note that reliability has not been an issue in studies \nof music-dependent memory, except in those cases where tempo was purposely kept \nthe same across switched-context conditions. This observation, again, attests to the \npossible role of mood mediation in music-dependent memory.  \n Given the apparent importance of mood-induced states to the emergence of \nCDM effects, it is useful to reflect on the critical factors that promote or hinder the \ndemonstration of mood-dependent memory (e.g., Bower, 2003; Eich, 1995a; Eich, & \nForgas, 2003). Mood-dependent memory effects seem to emerge most reliably when: \n(1) to-be-remembered items are generated by participants or actively processed by \nthem in some way (e.g., Balch, Myers, & Papotto, 1999; Eich & Metcalfe, 1989; Eich \net al., 1994); (2) memory is tested via free recall (e.g., Beck & McBee, 1995; Bower, \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  7\n1981; Eich & Metcalfe, 1989), with recollection arising immediately after learning \nrather than at a delay (e.g., Balch et al., 1992); and (3) mood induction is done with \ngreat care to ensure that the mood manipulation is strong, that it lasts throughout the \nlearning or testing phase, and that where moods are switched they are substantially \ndifferent (e.g., Bower, 1992; Eich et al., 1994; Isen, 1984). \nIn more recent research on music-induced mood states and CDM, Balch, \nMyers, and Papotto (1999) further investigated the links between the arousal and \npleasantness dimensions of mood and CDM effects. Balch et al.\u2019s experiments pre-\nclassified selections of \u201cmood music\u201d in terms of pleasantness and arousal, and then \nsystematically manipulated such selections in a CDM paradigm. Switching music on \nonly the pleasantness dimension decreased memory whether or not the intended mood \nof the pieces had been explicitly described to participants by the experimenter. \nHowever, just changing the arousal dimension of music decreased memory only when \nintended moods had been explicitly defined. These results indicate the robustness of \npleasantness-dependent memory, but raise some concerns about the reliability of \narousal-dependent memory. Still, it should be borne in mind that Balch and Lewis\u2019 \nearlier research (e.g., Balch & Lewis, 1996, Experiment 4) did find evidence for \ntempo-dependent CDM effects being mediated by arousal changes even without \nparticipants being directly instructed on what mood to try to attain during music \npresentations at learning. In sum, mood arousal in music-based CDM seems a real \nphenomenon, but perhaps a somewhat inconsistent one. \nReturning to the present study, we note that music-dependent memory is still a \nrelatively new domain of research, where little is known about what dimensions of \nmusic can serve as CDM cues and whether mood-mediation is always a critical \nelement of music-based CDM effects. Whilst Balch and Lewis (1996) found that \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  8\ntempo-dependent memory was mediated by mood, they did not explicitly consider if \nthe tonality of music (i.e., the use of major or minor keys) is a further dimension of \nmusic that may induce robust CDM effects (perhaps also through mood mediation). \nIndeed, studies of music-dependent memory do not appear to have directly controlled \nfor that tonality of the pieces selected for study. This seems like a curious omission \ngiven that tonality is well-known for its use by composers as a central device to \nmodulate mood changes in listeners. The minor key is often described as invoking \nsadness, whilst the major key is claimed to instil feelings of happiness. Recent studies \nhave also provided empirical evidence that the affective tone of musical chords can \ninfluence the speed of evaluation of affectively congruent chord--target word pairings \nrelative to affectively incongruent pairings (Sollberger, Reber, & Eckstein, 2003), and \nthat musical tone (major vs. minor) may impact on mood valence (i.e., inducing \npositive vs. negative mood states respectively), but not arousal (Husain, Thompson, & \nSchellenberg, 2002).  \n The present experiment used a single selection of music (to control for timbre, \nform, tempo, melody and the like) and examined whether reinstating or switching its \nmusical key between item learning and recall could produce a CDM effect that was \nsystematically related to mood changes. The main research questions were: can the \nkey of a musical piece act as a retrieval cue for the recall of words when reinstated, \nrelative to when it is switched, and can such a CDM effect, if present, be shown to be \nmediated by changes in people\u2019s mood states? A tonality-based CDM effect on recall \nwould manifest itself as a cross-over interaction between learning environment (minor \nvs. major) and recall environment (minor vs. major). Furthermore, the mood-\nmediation hypothesis would gain support if tonality changes were seen to be \nsystematically linked to mood changes, and, more critically, if a regression-based \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  9\n\u201cmediation analysis\u201d of the data  (e.g., Baron & Kenny, 1986) could establish a path \nbetween the context manipulation and recall scores that was mediated by mood status. \nIn our study we were mindful to employ a methodology that was most likely to reveal \nmood-mediated CDM, that is, we included active processing of the to-be-remembered \nmaterial and an immediate free-recall paradigm. \nMethod \nParticipants \n Participants were 48 Lancaster University undergraduates (10 males, 38 \nfemales; age range: 19-25 years) who volunteered to take part in the study for a small \nfinancial incentive. All had normal or corrected-to-normal hearing and vision. \nParticipants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions.  \nApparatus and Stimuli \n Word items and incidental learning task. The to-be-remembered words were \n24 common, two- and three-syllable nouns with a concreteness rating of five or \nabove, selected from Spreen and Schultz\u2019s (1966) norms (e.g., basket, library, cousin \netc.). The learning phase of the study involved an incidental (rather than intentional) \nword-learning method (i.e., each presented word had to be rated for pleasantness on a \nsix-point scale and the subsequent recall task came as a surprise test of incidental \nmemory). Participants were given a pencil and a booklet for rating the words on the 6-\npoint scale (1 for very unpleasant, 2 for moderately unpleasant, 3 for slightly \nunpleasant, 4 for slightly pleasant, 5 for moderately pleasant, and 6 for very \npleasant). The requirement for participants to rate words for pleasantness enabled \nsemantic thought processes to occur, thereby encouraging deep encoding of the items \n(e.g.,  Hyde & Jenkins, 1973). Note that the selection of the 24 words aimed to \nachieve a  roughly equal distribution of items that were believed to have positive, \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  10\nnegative and neutral emotional connotations, so as to encourage a degree of \nvariability in participants pleasantness ratings as well as some genuine semantic \nprocessing of the words (see Appendix A for the full list of word items used). \n Music selections. Words were presented for rating during the learning phase \nalong with background music either in a major or minor key. The music used in the \nstudy was a Frederic Chopin piano score (\u201cWaltz in A Minor, Op. 34 No.2\u201d) \noriginally written in a minor key and lasting approximately 105 s. This score was \ntransposed into a major key by an expert musician and pianist, without changing any \nother aspects such as tempo or phrasing. Tape recordings were made of the minor and \nmajor versions of the musical piece being played by the expert pianist. These \nrecordings were obtained using a high-quality audio-cassette recorder with an \nexternal, multi-directional microphone positioned 1 metre in front of the piano. The \ninput volume of the tape recorder was set to its default level to equate the recording \nvolume for the two versions of the piano piece, and recordings were made with Dolby \nnoise-reduction set to Mode C. Five repetitions of each piece (totalling approximately \n8 min for each version) were then re-recorded onto a new cassette. A recording was \nalso made of 240 s of birdsong that was to be played between the learning and testing \nphases. During the experiment the musical pieces and the birdsong were re-played to \nparticipants using a high-quality cassette player with external speakers, with the \nvolume setting set at a mid-point such that the sound was neither unpleasantly loud \nnor overly quiet.  \n Our study was based on an assumption that the major-key music would be \nperceived as inducing a more positive mood state than the minor-key music. To \nexamine this issue we obtained mood ratings for each version of the waltz using a 9 x \n9 \u201cmood grid\u201d (see Appendix B; cf. Russell, Weiss, & Mendelsohn, 1989) that \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  11\ndepicted the mood dimensions of arousal and pleasantness. This music pre-test used a \nsample of 42 undergraduate participants who did not take part in the main experiment. \nThese participants were randomly assigned to listen individually to either the major-\nkey or minor-key version of the waltz for 4 min, after which they were requested to \nmark a single point on the grid that reflected how the music made them feel in terms \nof arousal and pleasantness. The music continued to play whilst participants decided \non their ratings. The arousal scores revealed a reliable difference between the major- \nand minor-key pieces, with the major-key music being viewed as more arousing (M = \n5.43, SE = 0.38) than the minor-key music (M = 4.19, SE = 0.39), F(1, 40) = 5.18, \nMSE = 3.11, p = .028, \u03b7p2  = .12. Likewise, the pleasantness scores indicated a \nsignificant difference between the pieces, with the major-key music being rated as \ninducing greater feelings of pleasantness (M = 7.24, SE = 0.23) relative to the minor-\nkey music (M = 6.24, SE = 0.30), F(1, 40) = 7.05, MSE = 1.49, p = .011, \u03b7p2  = .15. \nThese results support the contention that tonality differences in musical selections can \ninduce predictable differences in mood states, although it is interesting that both of the \nmusical selection were rated toward the \u201cpleasant\u201d end of the pleasantness dimension, \nwhereas the arousal dimension was arguably a better discriminator of predicted mood \ndifferences for these pieces (i.e., the minor-key music was rated on the negative side \nof the arousal midpoint and the major-key piece on the positive side of the midpoint). \n This original Chopin waltz in its minor key was considered to be unlikely to \nsound particularly familiar to our undergraduate participants, few of whom have \nclassical tastes in music. More critical was the need to validate that the transposed \nmajor-key version of the waltz did not differ in its perceived familiarity to the minor-\nkey version, or, indeed, seem \u201codd\u201d in some way. To examine these issues we \nobtained familiarity and oddness ratings for each version of the waltz using the 9 x 9 \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  12\n\u201cfamiliarity\/oddness grid\u201d depicted in Appendix B. The same participants who rated \nthe two versions of the Waltz for mood-inducing properties were also asked to \nprovide familiarity and oddness ratings for the piece subsequent to generating their \nmood ratings. Again, the music continued to play whilst the participant decided which \nsquare to a mark on the grid. No reliable difference in perceived familiarity was \nobserved for the major-key piece (M = 5.24, SE = 0.40) relative to the minor-key \npiece (M = 4.90, SE = 0.52), F(1, 40) = 0.26, MSE = 4.54, p = .62, \u03b7p2  = .01. Both \nversions of the waltz were viewed as being neither particularly familiar nor \nunfamiliar. In addition, no significant differences emerged in the perceived oddness of \nthe transposed major-key version (M = 3.24, SE = 0.37) relative to the original, \nminor-key version (M = 3.29, SE = 0.37),  F(1, 40) = 0.01, MSE = 3.10, p = .93, \u03b7p2 < \n.001. Both pieces were viewed as having low oddness. These ratings are encouraging \nin that they attest to the close similarity of the two versions of the musical piece at the \nlevel of their perceived familiarity and oddness. \n Mood measures.  During the experiment, participants\u2019 mood states were \nassessed at various phases of the experiment using Watson, Clark, and Tellegen\u2019s \n(1988) \u201cPositive and Negative Affect Schedule\u201d (PANAS), which involves a list of \nwords that describe moods (five negatively and five positively valenced). Participants \nuse a 5-point scale to rate how appropriate each word is for describing how they are \nfeeling at that particular moment (1 denotes that they are not at all feeling like this, \nand 5 denotes that they are indeed feeling like this). \nDesign \n Participants were randomly allocated to four conditions in a 2 x 2 between-\nparticipants design that manipulated the Learning Context (major vs. minor key) and \nthe Retrieval Context (major vs. minor key). Thus, two conditions involved \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  13\nreinstatement of the key of the musical selection between learning and retrieval and \ntwo conditions involved key switches. Dependent variables were the number of words \n(out of 24) correctly recalled and participants\u2019 mood ratings. \nProcedure \n Participants were tested in small groups of between two and four in the same \nroom for all conditions. They were informed that the study was about language \nprocessing to enable use of the incidental word-learning method, whereby each \npresented item had to be rated for pleasantness. Once the learning-phase music \ncommenced, participants were asked to get into the mood suggested by the music. \nAfter 60 s they completed their first PANAS (which took approximately 60 s) and \nthen commenced the rating of the presented words for pleasantness, whilst the music \ncontinued. The 24 words each presented in large typeface on separate index cards at a \nrate of one item every 5 s. Cards were held up by the experimenter and were clearly \nvisible to all seated participants. The inter-stimulus interval was approximately 1 s. To \nhelp give participants sufficient exposure to the material, two different random orders \nof the 24-word list were run consecutively to generate a complete sequence of 48 \nitems (cf. Balch & Lewis, 1996). During the instructions participants had been \ninformed that each word would be repeated somewhere in the sequence and that they \nshould rate each presented word in terms of their impression of its pleasantness at that \nparticular moment. One of two different 48-word sequences was assigned to half of \nthe participants in each learning condition.  \n After rating the 48 words for pleasantness participants completed a second \nPANAS with the background music continuing. They then listened to 240 s of \nbirdsong which acted as a \u201cdistraction piece\u201d \u2013 following a procedure developed by \nBalch et al. (1992, Experiment 3). This procedure was intended to help avoid \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  14\nparticipants in switched-key conditions simply being differentially distracted by the \naltered key of the second piece compared with participants in reinstated-key \nconditions. Such added distraction could act to disrupt attention and impair recall \nperformance in a way that is essentially uninteresting from a CDM standpoint. \nHowever, an intentionally distracting piece of sound (birdsong in the present case) \ninserted between word presentation and recall, should have helped eliminate such \ndifferences in the level of distraction produced by recall contexts. Birdsong was used \nas it was distractingly different to the classical music used in the learning and recall \nphases (i.e., it is essentially a collection of varied sounds with no particular order or \nkey). \n After the birdsong, participants progressed to the word-retrieval phase, and \nwere again asked to get into the mood portrayed by the music. Mood states were \nassessed using the PANAS both before free recall (i.e., 60 s in from the recall-context \nrecording being started) and directly after free recall. The background music \ncontinued to play throughout the PANAS-rating and free-recall stages of the second \npart of the study. Two minutes were allowed for the recall session itself. To initiate \nrecall participants were handed a piece of paper and asked to write down, in any \norder, as many of the originally presented words that they could recall. After the \ncompletion of the study all participants were debriefed.  \nResults and Discussion \n An alpha level of  .05 was set for all statistical analyses. Where appropriate, \neffect-size estimates, measured by partial eta-squared (\u03b7p2), are also presented. \nWord-Pleasantness Ratings \n One issue that we sought to address before progressing to an analysis of recall \nscores and mood data was whether the tonality of the music context at learning had \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  15\ninfluenced participants\u2019 word-pleasantness ratings (e.g., invoking more pleasant \nratings in major-key contexts and less pleasant ratings in minor-key contexts). Such \nan influence would be indicative of mood congruence (i.e., participants\u2019 interpreting \nthe pleasantness of words in a manner that matched their current mood state). Any \nevidence for mood congruence effects in the present study would complicate the \ninterpretation of any contextual influences on recall.  \n To examine this issue we first pursued an analysis that involved calculating \neach person\u2019s overall mean word-pleasantness rating across all list items. We grouped \nthese mean ratings in terms of whether the participant had been in the major-key \ncondition at learning or the minor-key condition at learning (see the final row of the \ntable presented in Appendix A). No evidence was found for a mood-congruence effect \non participants\u2019 overall word-pleasantness ratings. Although words were rated slightly \nmore positively on average in the major-key condition (M = 3.62, SE = .10 ) relative \nto the minor-key condition (M = 3.51, SE = .08 ) this effect was far from reliable, F(1, \n46) = 0.72, MSE = 0.19, p = .40, \u03b7p2  = .02.  \n To examine the mood-congruence issue further, we conducted item-based \nanalyses that assessed, for each word, whether there was a difference in its rating \nacross minor-key versus major-key conditions (see Appendix A for a full summary of \nmeans and standard errors). Only 3 words (\u201capple\u201d, \u201cbush\u201d, and \u201cflame\u201d) out of 24 \nshowed a reliable difference relating to the presence of major-key versus minor-key \nmusic during the pleasantness-rating task. These three differences were all reliable in \nthe expected direction of an increased positive rating in the major-key context relative \nto the minor-key one. Other differences that came close to significance were for the \nwords \u201cprofessor\u201d (p = .080) and \u201ccard\u201d (p = .072), but  these differences were in the \nopposite-to-predicted direction. Overall, then, it seems unlikely that changes in \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  16\nperceived pleasantness for words across different music tonalities would have had any \nserious or systematic influence on word retention or recall performance in the present \nstudy. \nRecall Scores \nMean recall scores for all conditions are shown in Table 1. It is evident that \nparticipants in retrieval conditions where the musical key at learning was reinstated \nrecalled more words than those in switched-key conditions. A 2 x 2 (Learning Context \nx Retrieval Context) between-participants analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed \nneither a main effect of Learning Context, F(1, 44) = 1.70, MSE = 5.95, p = .20, \u03b7p2  = \n.04, nor of Testing Context, F(1, 44) = 1.70, MSE = 5.95, p = .20, \u03b7p2 = .04. The \nequivalence of the statistical values obtained for these two main effects was checked \nin case a calculation error had been made, but these values were, in fact, found to be \naccurate (i.e., the equivalence is purely coincidental).  \nAlthough the ANOVA revealed no main effects, it did indicate a reliable and \npredicted interaction between the Learning Context and Testing Context factors, F(1, \n44) = 23.56, MSE = 5.95, p < . 001, \u03b7p2 = .35. This interaction, which is indicative of a \ntonality-based CDM effect, was explored further by a series of Tukey HSD pairwise \ncomparisons. Significantly more words were recalled in the reinstated minor-key \ncondition relative to each of the switched-key conditions (both ps < .001). The \ndifference between the major-key reinstated condition and the two switched-key \nconditions was marginally reliable (both ps = .072). Finally, and as expected, there \nwas no significant difference between the two reinstated-key conditions (p = .27) or \nbetween the two switched-key conditions (p = .99).  \n(Table 1 about here) \n \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  17\nMood Scores \nEach participant rated their current mood state using the PANAS at four points \nduring the experiment: twice during the learning phase (once directly before \nincidental word-learning and once immediately after), and twice during the retrieval \nphase (once before the recall task and once after). A single mood score was computed \nfor each PANAS completed by a participant by subtracting their negative-affect total \nfrom their positive-affect total. The resulting mood score signified the participant\u2019s \nmood at that particular point in the study. To simplify analysis and interpretation of \nmood data we averaged each participant\u2019s two mood scores for the learning phase to \nproduce a single learning-phase score; we did the same for the two retrieval-phase \nmood scores. Statistical analyses were pursued using these single mood scores for the \nlearning and retrieval phases. We consider the analysis of mood effects in the \nreinstated-key conditions before the effects in the switched-key conditions. \nMood effects in reinstated-key conditions.  Mean mood scores at learning and \nretrieval for the reinstated-key conditions are shown in Table 2. As expected, moods \ntended to be rated higher (i.e., more positively) when participants heard the music in \nthe major key as opposed to the minor key. A 2 x 2 (i.e., Key x Phase) mixed \nbetween-within ANOVA supported this observation and revealed a reliable effect of \nKey, F(1, 22) = 11.4, MSE = 45.59, p = .003, \u03b7p2 = .34. An effect of Phase was also \nfound, F(1, 22) = 19.73, MSE = 11.20,  p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .47, with overall mood scores \nbeing higher in the learning phase than the retrieval phase. In addition, a reliable \ninteraction was found between Key and Phase, F(1, 22) = 7.15, MSE = 11.20,  p = \n.014, \u03b7p2 = .25, such that the phase of the study the participant was in (i.e., learning vs. \nretrieval) had a greater impact when the major key was reinstated than when the \nminor key was reinstated.  \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  18\n (Table 2 about here) \nThese last two effects were unexpected, and relate to the way in which \npeople\u2019s moods seems to be less positive than anticipated when the major-key music \nwas played at retrieval. The interaction was explored using Tukey HSD pairwise \ncomparisons. The mood scores for the two minor conditions did not differ \nsignificantly (p = .83), suggesting that the negative mood induced at learning was \nmaintained at retrieval. However, the mood scores for the two major conditions did \ndiffer significantly (p < .001), indicating that the positive mood induced at learning \nhad dissipated substantially by the retrieval phase. Still, it is noteworthy that mood at \nretrieval in the major-key condition was still rather higher than either of the mood \nscores in the minor-key conditions, but not reliably so (i.e., p = .31 when compared \nwith the minor key at learning, and p = .08 when compared with the minor key at \nretrieval).  \nInterestingly, the mood effects depicted in Table 2 may go some way toward \nexplaining aspects of the recall effects shown in Table 1. That is, the reinstated minor-\nkey condition produced the greatest recall score and was also associated with the best \noverlap of mood state between learning and retrieval phases. The reinstated major-key \ncondition produced the next best recall score, and was associated with a weaker \noverlap in mood state between learning and retrieval. These patterns of association \nbetween retrieval scores and mood scores appear to provide some support for a mood-\nmediation account of music-dependent memory. We acknowledge, however, that the \ncorrelational basis of this evidence does not permit strong conclusions to be drawn \nconcerning the causal link between music tonality, mood scores and recall. We \nexamine the issue of the causal role of mood mediation in promoting CDM effects \nlater in this section using path-analysis techniques.  \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  19\nThe basic issue of why the major-key music was less likely to induce a \npositive mood at retrieval than at learning in the reinstated-key condition is intriguing. \nParticipants\u2019 feedback indicated that many had been irritated by the birdsong in the \nintervening phase between learning and retrieval, whilst others indicated that they had \nbecome somewhat fatigued by the experimental procedure by the retrieval phase. As \nsuch, participants may have entered the final phase of the study  in a more negative \nmood that was difficult to overturn via the major-key music selection. Alternatively, \nthere have been suggestions in the literature on experimentally induced mood states \n(e.g., Gerrards-Hesse, Spies, & Hesse, 1994) that it may simply be more difficult to \ninduce a positive mood in participants than a negative mood -- although in the present \nstudy it appeared that positive mood induction was very successful at learning and \njust less effective at retrieval. \n Mood effects in switched-key conditions.  Mood ratings in the switched-key \nconditions would be expected to reveal a cross-over interaction pattern, with \nparticipants\u2019 mood states switching from happier to sadder when the major key is \npresent at learning and the minor key is present at retrieval, whilst the opposite switch \nin mood should arise when the minor key is present at learning and the major key is \npresent at retrieval. The mood data in Table 3 support this expected pattern of results. \nA 2 x 2 (i.e., Key x Phase) mixed between-within ANOVA revealed a marginally \nsignificant effect of Key, F(1, 22) = 3.93, MSE = 45.40, p = .06, \u03b7p2 = .15, with the \nmajor--minor switch promoting higher overall mood ratings than the minor--major \nswitch. This unexpected effect again seems to be a result of the major key at retrieval \nbeing less potent at inducing a positive mood state than the major key at learning. The \nANOVA revealed no main effect of Phase, F(1, 22) = 2.53, MSE = 51.98, p = .13, \u03b7p2 \n= .10. However, the predicted cross-over interaction between Key and Phase was \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  20\nhighly reliable, F(1, 22) = 13.79, MSE = 51.98, p = . 001, \u03b7p2 = .39, indicating that  \nthat the moods of participants changed in opposite directions in the two switched-key \nconditions.  \nTukey post-hoc tests showed that the switch in moods between learning and \nretrieval had successfully occurred for the major--minor switched condition (p = \n.006), but not for the minor--major switched condition (p = .45), although the mood \nchange was in the right direction. The difficulty in inducing a strongly positive mood \nusing the major key in the second phase of the study is supported by the fact that the \nmood score for the major key at retrieval was no different from either of the minor-\nkey conditions (ps = .45 and .56). In contrast, the mood score for the major key at \nlearning was reliably different from both minor-key conditions (ps = .006 and .004). \n(Table 3 about here) \n Path analysis of mood-mediation effect.  Although our recall and mood \nanalyses provide some intriguing hints that mood changes may mediate between \ntonality manipulations and the emergence of CDM effects, the data are far from clear-\ncut in supporting the mood-mediation hypothesis. One way to examine the role of \nmood states in mediating between music-tonality manipulations and recall scores is to \nemploy path-analysis based around linear regression techniques. To this end we \nundertook a standard \u201cmediation analysis\u201d (e.g., Baron & Kenny, 1986) to determine \nif a mediated relationship existed that was based on mood states. \n To pursue this path analysis we first computed a \u201cchange score\u201d for each \nparticipant that captured the stability or instability of their mood across the learning \nand retrieval phases of the study. This mood change score is arguably the most \nappropriate mediating variable to enter into the analysis as it is predicted that those \nparticipants with a stable mood between learning and testing (i.e., in the reinstated-\n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  21\ntonality conditions) should evidence better recall than those with a non-stable mood \nbetween learning and retrieval (i.e., in the switched-tonality conditions). The predictor \nvariable in the analysis was designated as contextual status (i.e., reinstated vs. \nswitched learning and retrieval contexts), and the outcome variable was a participant\u2019s \nrecall score. The results of this mediation analysis are summarised in Table 4, which \nshows the relationship between contextual status (reinstated vs. switched), mood \nchange, and recall. The amount of mood mediation was very small (i.e., 0.576 - 0.561 \n= .015), and a Sobel test revealed the clear lack of reliability of this mediating effect, \nGoodman (I) = -0.27, p = .785. Thus, the upshot of this path analysis is that the mood-\nmediation hypothesis of tonality-based CDM finds little support in the present study. \nIndeed, it is music-tonality changes per se that seem most closely linked to the \nemergence of CDM effects in our dataset, with any associated mood induction \nseemingly playing no convincing causal role in recall performance.   \n(Table 4 about here) \nGeneral Discussion \n \nThe aim of the present study was twofold. First, we wanted to extend research \non music-dependent memory (e.g., Balch et al., 1992) by investigating music-tonality \nmanipulations (i.e., the presence of major vs. minor musical keys as environmental \ncontexts), as opposed to other music dimensions that have been examined previously \nsuch as tempo (which produces a CDM effect) and instrument timbre or musical \ngenre (which do not appear to produce a CDM effect). Second, we wanted to examine \nthe underlying mechanism associated with music-based CDM. In particular, Eich \n(1995a) has provided evidence that all CDM effects -- whether related to \nmanipulations of location or other environmental contexts such as ambient music -- \nmay be mediated by induced mood states (see also Lewis & Critchley, 2003, for \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  22\nevidence for a possible neural basis of mood-dependent memory effects). Balch and \nLewis (1996) supported this \u201cmood-mediation hypothesis\u201d in their study of tempo-\ndependent memory effects. They showed, for example, that the tempo of the music \ninfluences the arousal dimension of mood (i.e., fast tempos are arousing), and that this \nmood dimension has to be reinstated at retrieval to aid recall.  \nOur particular interest in music tonality ties in with the potential role of mood-\nmediation in CDM, as tonality is well known for its use by composers as way to \ncommunicate atmosphere and to modulate people\u2019s mood states. Intriguingly, \nhowever, there appears to be no published research that has directly examined musical \nkey and CDM. Moreover, in previous studies that have successfully demonstrated \nCDM effects with music (e.g., Balch et al., 1992; Balch & Lewis, 1996; Smith 1995) \nthe actual tonality of music selections was left uncontrolled, potentially confusing the \ninterpretation of resulting effects. In our research we were particularly mindful to \nexercise tight control over our tonality manipulation, such that the same piece of \nmusic (a Chopin waltz) was used in all contexts, but with it being transposed from a \nminor key to a major key to afford the necessary contextual permutations.  \n In relation to our first aim, the results of our experiment provided clear \nevidence for tonality-dependent memory, thus extending evidence beyond the one, \nwell-established musical dimension (i.e., tempo) that is known to produce CDM \neffects on immediate recall. Our study showed that when participants learnt a list of \nwords when listening to a piece of music of a particular tonality their recall at testing \nwas enhanced if the music tonality was reinstated rather than switched. Reinstating \nthe minor-key music selection produced a particularly marked CDM effect. \n In relation to our second aim, the assessment of participants\u2019 mood states \nduring the experiment provided some initial, suggestive evidence that the observed \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  23\nCDM effects may have been mediated through the mood states induced by the \ndifferent music tonalities. Thus, participants in the switched-key conditions \ndemonstrated switched moods between learning and retrieval phases, and recalled \nfewer words than participants in the reinstated-key conditions, whose moods were \nmore consistent throughout the learning and retrieval phases. It was also established \nthat the contrasting musical keys induced contrasting moods in participants: The \nmusic in a minor key induced a more negative (i.e., sad) mood than the identical piece \nof music in a major key, as predicted. Despite this apparent support for the mood-\nmediation account of CDM effects, a subsequent path analysis of the mediating role \nof mood in tonality-based CDM provided no support for this hypothesis. Indeed, the \namount of mood mediation was extremely small, with the variability in the recall data \nbeing determined almost solely by the music-tonality manipulation itself.  \nIn summary, our study has demonstrated the existence of clear-cut tonality-\nbased CDM effects, but has failed to established support for a mood-mediation theory \nof tonality effects, despite evidence for an apparent association between tonality \nchanges and mood changes. As such, our findings, can be interpreted as falling in line \nwith the \u201cmental-context hypothesis\u201d of CDM (e.g., as espoused by Smith, 1995). \nThis hypothesis claims that mood states, if they arise, have no special status or \nnecessary role in mediating between context manipulations and retrieval, but are \ninstead just another form of mentally-represented cue that can work alongside other \nrepresented cues (e.g., tonality) to aid retrieval, if reinstated.  \nThis latter interpretation, however, is somewhat weakened by its inability to \naccommodate previous evidence for mood mediation determining the impact of tempo \nchanges in music-based CDM (e.g., Balch & Lewis, 1996). Of course, it might be \nproposed that mood mediation arises with some contextual changes (e.g., music \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  24\ntempo) but not with other musical properties (i.e., music tonality). However, this \nproposal begs the question of what it is about music tempo that promotes mood-\nmediated CDM memory and what it is about music tonality that does not. Previous \nevidence has indicated that tempo can influence mood arousal but not pleasantness \n(e.g., Balch & Lewis, 1996), whilst tonality may shows the reverse pattern, impacting \non mood pleasantness but not arousal (Husain et al., 2002). Perhaps, then, it is only \narousal changes that lead to mood-mediated CDM effects whilst pleasantness changes \ndo not? Although this is an interesting possibility, our music pre-test data actually run \ncounter to this interpretation, as the minor-key version of the waltz promoted reliably \nlower feelings of both pleasantness and arousal than the major-key version. \n The pre-test data do, however, give rise to a third account of why mood-\nmediation was not found to be reliable in the present study. This account relates to our \nuse of the PANAS mood checklist as a way to measure mood changes during the \nexperiment. The PANAS seems to be an effective method for detecting the \npleasantness aspects of mood, but it may have lacked sufficient sensitivity to detect \nthe arousal dimension of mood. Moreover, if it is mood arousal that mediates between \ncontextual manipulations and recall (as in the case of tempo-based CDM) then the use \nof the PANAS may have underestimated the role of arousal as a mediating variable \nbetween tonality and recall in the present study. Indeed, it is interesting that in the \nmusic pre-test it was the arousal dimension that actually polarised the two pieces most \neffectively (i.e., the minor-key music was rated on the negative side of the arousal \nmid-point and the major-key piece on the positive side of the arousal mid-point).  \n Examining the possible role of mood arousal as a mediating variable between \nmusic-tonality manipulations and recall scores would seem to be a particularly useful \navenue for future research. As things stand, however, we have to acknowledge that \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  25\nthe evidence from our study does not allow us to go beyond the position that tonality-\nbased influences on memory may simply relate to mental context changes (cf. Smith, \n1995; Tulving, 1983). Notwithstanding the uncertainty over the role of mood-\nmediation in music-based CDM, we believe that one of the most important \ncontributions of our study remains its unique demonstration that the tonality \ndimension of music (i.e., whether it is in a minor or a major key) can lead to striking \nCDM effects similar to those observed with manipulations of music tempo.  \n                                                                                   Music Tonality and Context  26\nReferences \nBalch, W.
