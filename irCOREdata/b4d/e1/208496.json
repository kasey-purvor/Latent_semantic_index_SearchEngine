Environmentalists are concerned, however, \nthat with enhanced international capital mobility the fear of capital loss might induce \ncountries not to raise standards \u2013 a phenomenon commonly described as \u2018regulatory \nchill\u2019. This article argues that while it is difficult to prove the validity of this claim, there \nexists substantial anecdotal evidence that \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 is relevant with respect to \none issue at least: global warming. Several policy options are evaluated to deal with this \nproblem according to a specified set of criteria. It is found that upward harmonisation of \nenvironmental standards and multilateral trade restrictions as part of multilateral envi-\nronmental agreement are the preferred policy options. \n \nKeywords: regulatory chill, capital flight, global warming, energy tax, harmonisation, \nmultilateral trade restrictions \n \n1 Introduction \nThis article addresses a concern by environmentalists with respect to international mo-\nbility of capital. The concern is that countries might fail to raise environmental stan-\ndards for fear of capital flight - a phenomenon that is commonly described as \u2018regulatory \nchill\u2019 or, less commonly, as \u2018stuck in the mud\u2019 (Zarsky 1997; Greenpeace 1999; Maybey \nand McGilvray 1999; Porter 1999). This article will examine what evidence is there in \nfavour of this claim and evaluate policy options to deal with the problem. \n3 \nSustainable development is an intensively contested concept (Neumayer 1999). \nHowever, no matter what the concrete definition is one wants to apply, a necessary con-\ndition for its achievement is that countries are able to raise environmental standards. In \nother words, \u2018regulatory chill\u2019, if existent, is inimical to sustainable development. It is \ntherefore important to assess the evidence with respect to this phenomenon and evaluate \npolicy options to deal with it. \nA priori, we would expect \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 to be more prevalent with respect to en-\nvironmental standards concerning pollutants affecting the so-called global commons, \nsuch as the global climate, the ozone layer, and biodiversity. We would expect it to be \nless significant for environmental standards concerning pollutants affecting the national \nenvironment only. This is because in the case of the global commons, the benefits of \nraising environmental standards have to be shared with all or at least many other coun-\ntries as well. In as far as capital flight is perceived to be one of the costs of raising envi-\nronmental standards, it will become relatively more important in this case then, as the \ncosts are balanced against dispersed benefits. \nWhat aggravates an examination of the evidence with respect to \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 is \nthat the claim refers to the absence of something that would otherwise have happened \n(namely, the raising of environmental standards). Thus it makes in effect a counter-\nfactual claim for which systematic statistical evidence is, almost by definition, difficult, \nif not impossible, to gather. In the words of Mabey and McNally (1999, p. 38): \u2018That \nthere is little statistical evidence of this \u2018chilling effect\u2019 is unsurprising, because evi-\ndence is needed of what has not happened. This issue must be investigated by historians \nand political scientists, not econometricians.\u2019 It follows that one needs to look at anec-\ndotal evidence to gauge the validity of the hypothesis. \n4 \nThe next section presents some of this evidence with respect to one environmental \nissue for which the existence of regulatory chill can be demonstrated quite well and \nwhich is caused by emissions that are clearly unsustainable: global warming. The main \npart of this article is contained in section 3, however, which evaluates various policy \noptions to deal with \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 according to a specified set of criteria. Section 4 \nconcludes. \n \n2 Some anecdotal evidence with respect to global warming \nEsty and Geradin (1998, p. 19) believe that the fear of capital loss has a \u2018most signifi-\ncant impact (...) on the environmental policy-making process\u2019. They suggest that \u2018in \nalmost every political debate over environmental policy in the United States, competi-\ntiveness concerns are cited as a reason not to move toward tougher standards\u2019 (ibid., p. \n20). While this quote refers to \u2018competitiveness concerns\u2019 more generally, it is relevant \nfor investment issues as well, as exit of its capital would be the ultimate effect of a ju-\nrisdiction\u2019s \u2018loss of competitiveness\u2019.  \nWhat Esty and Geradin suggest for the eminent importance of \u2018competitiveness\u2019 is-\nsues for environmental policy making in the United States holds true for Germany as \nwell. The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) and other industrial associa-\ntions have continuously warned policy makers that further raising environmental stan-\ndards, especially with respect to a so-called ecological tax reform, would damage the \ncompetitiveness of German industry and would lead to capital flight out of Germany \n(BDI 1998, 1999). But do these concerns and threats really translate into \u2018regulatory \nchill\u2019? Are policy makers scared away from raising standards or do they regard these \nthreats by industry groups as cheap talk whose only function is to prevent policies that \nwould raise costs to the industry and (potentially) lower its profits? \n5 \nIn the following I will concentrate on one issue for which I believe that we have suf-\nficient evidence to show that the fear of capital loss has actually led to a \u2018regulatory \nchill\u2019. The issue is how much developed countries should reduce air emissions, particu-\nlarly greenhouse gas emissions, and, specifically, whether they should introduce a tax on \nfossil fuels to achieve reductions in these emissions. As concerns the United States, \nPresident Clinton\u2019s initial plan to introduce a 25.5 cents per million of British Thermal \nUnits (BTUs) energy tax over a period of three years was defeated not least by the mas-\nsive resistance by the \u2018American Energy Alliance\u2019, behind which stood the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, and the Affordable Energy Alliance as well as the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, behind which in turn stands the US oil industry (Erlands-\nson 1994). These lobby groups claimed that such a tax would reduce their \u2018competitive-\nness\u2019 with a consequent loss of jobs and might ultimately lead to a flight of capital out \nof the U.S. \nSimilarly, the United States\u2019 position in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations was signifi-\ncantly influenced by the opposition of some of its industries, which gathered in the so-\ncalled Global Climate Change Coalition (GCC), as well as the AFL-CIO, the major US \ntrade union, which again warned that millions of jobs would be lost due to decreased \ncompetitiveness and capital flight if a climate change protocol did not encompass the \nmajor developing countries (BNA 1997; API 2000; Zarsky 1997, p. 36f.).1 As a result, \nthe U.S. Senate voted 95-0, with five senators not voting, in favour of a motion that the \nU.S. must not sign a treaty which does not mandate \u2018new specific scheduled commit-\nments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties within \nthe same compliance period\u2019 or would result in \u2018serious harm to the economy of the \nUnited States\u2019 (BNA 1997) - \u2018where by \u201cserious harm\u201c the Senate meant, in the words \nof Senator Robert Byrd, a co-author of the resolution, \u201ccapital flight and a loss of jobs in \n6 \nthe United States\u201c\u2019 (Barrett 1998, p. 21). In the end, the U.S. government signed the \nKyoto Protocol, which does not include any emissions reduction obligations for devel-\noping countries. But whether this signature will be followed by the necessary ratification \nthrough the U.S. Senate is far from clear. Immediately after the U.S. government\u2019s sig-\nnature under the Kyoto Protocol, the GCC, the Competitive Enterprise Institute as well \nas Republican Senator Chuck Nagel, co-sponsor of the above mentioned motion, called \nfor President Clinton to bring the Protocol to the Senate floor so that it could be rejected \n(BNA 1998). The Clinton administration wisely refused, saying it will not submit the \ntreaty until more developing countries agreed to limit their emissions of greenhouse \ngases (ibid.). \nAs concerns the European Union (EU), its Commission had originally proposed a \ncommunity-wide introduction of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and energy in 1992 \n(European Commission 1992), which, among other things, would have raised the price \nof petrol by about $10 per barrel in 2000. Eight years later, at the time of writing this \narticle, this tax has still not materialised and it is highly unlikely that it ever will.2 At \nleast partly this failure is to be explained by opposition from business groups, which did \nnot leave policy makers, even those from environmental \u2018leaders\u2019 such as the Scandina-\nvian countries and Germany, unimpressed. Maybe more importantly, however, the \nCommission\u2019s original proposal had the possibility for \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 already in-\ncluded. This is because in its Art. 1 it conditioned the realisation of the tax within the \nEU on the introduction \u2018by other member countries of the OECD of a similar tax or of \nmeasures having a financial impact equivalent to those provided for in this Directive\u2019. In \nother words, the Commission was so much impressed by the threat of \u2018loss of competi-\ntiveness\u2019 and, ultimately, loss of capital, that it accepted not raising environmental stan-\ndards if other OECD countries did not follow suit. As the likelihood of this to happen, \n7 \nespecially with respect to the US, was very small indeed, the EU\u2019s regulatory efforts \nwere effectively chilled. \nAs concerns Germany, the ecological tax reform became realised after a Social De-\nmocrat-Green coalition took over power at the federal level in October 1998. However, \nthe tax reform had to be downsized and had to include a number of exceptions for en-\nergy-intensive industries due to immense pressure from industrial lobby groups. Ironi-\ncally, the Federal Environment Minister himself rushed to persuade industries and the \npublic alike that with so many exceptions and rather low tax rates capital flight out of \nGermany has been effectively prevented (BMU 2000). Quite similarly, in the case of \nSweden the manufacturing industry is exempted from half of the energy and carbon di-\noxide tax and the electricity production for the manufacturing industry is not taxed at all \n(OECD 1999, p. 67). \nAre policies trying to overcome \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 necessary? The conclusion from the \nanecdotal evidence is that the fear of \u2018loss of competitiveness\u2019 in general and loss of \ncapital in particular, seems to have exerted some regulatory chilling effect on developed \ncountries with respect to reducing greenhouse and other air emissions and, in particular, \nwith respect to introducing taxes on fossil fuels. This chilling effect did not completely \nprevent the introduction of carbon abatement policies. After all, the United States and \nother developed countries did sign the Kyoto Protocol (but have not ratified it yet), \nGermany has entered into an ecological tax reform, the Scandinavian countries had ear-\nlier already introduced carbon\/energy taxes (Brack, Grubb and Windram 2000, pp. 59-\n70) and a European Union wide carbon tax might still materialise. But it is also true that \npolicy makers in developed countries did not introduce abatement policies as stringent \nas they would have otherwise done had they not been concerned about \u2018loss of competi-\ntiveness\u2019 and loss of capital. \n8 \nWhether this evidence in favour of the \u2018regulatory chill\u2019-hypothesis holds true for \nother environmental issues as well is not fully clear. Not many case studies have been \nundertaken on this matter and there is a clear need for future research. But greenhouse \ngas and other air emissions cause major environmental problems, so that it is appropri-\nate to move one step further and evaluate policy options to deal with \u2018regulatory chill\u2019. \n \n \n3 An evaluation of policy options to deal with \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 \n3.1 Policy options and criteria of evaluation \nIn this section, I will examine a number of policy options to deal with the problem of \n\u2018regulatory chill\u2019: \n \nHarmonisation of environmental standards and minimum standards. This can ei-\nther refer to the harmonisation of environmental laws and regulations or to the harmoni-\nsation of environment-related taxes. An existing example for this on a regional level are \nArt. 93, 95 and 175 of the Treaty establishing the EU. Art. 93 provides for the harmoni-\nsation of indirect taxes. Art. 95 has as its objective the adoption of \u2018measures for the \napproximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in \nMember States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the in-\nternal market\u2019 (Art. 95:1). Art. 175 has as its objective the harmonisation of \u2018measures \nanswering environmental protection requirements\u2019 (Art. 174:2). EU harmonised stan-\ndards are in principle to be interpreted as setting minimum standards that can be ex-\nceeded by member states under certain conditions. Art. 95:10 allows for harmonisation \nmeasures to include, in appropriate cases, \u2018a safeguard clause authorising the Member \nState to take, for one or more of the non-economic reasons referred to in Article 30, \n9 \nprovisional measures subject to a Community control procedure\u2019. Art. 95:4 allows EU \nmember states, more generally, to maintain national provisions if it deems them neces-\nsary for the protection of the environment. Similarly, Art. 176 proclaims that harmonisa-\ntion based on Art. 175 \u2018shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or intro-\nducing more stringent protective measures\u2019. \nEnforcement agreements. An existing example are Art. 3 and 5 of the North American \nAgreement on Environmental Cooperation, the environmental side agreement to \nNAFTA, which reads as follows: \n \nRecognizing the right of each Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and \nenvironmental development policies and priorities, and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental \nlaws and regulations, each Party shall ensure that its laws and regulations provide for high levels of envi-\nronmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve those laws and regulations. (Art. 3). \nWith the aim of achieving high levels of environmental protection and compliance with its environmental \nlaws and regulations, each Party shall effectively enforce its environmental laws and regulations through \nappropriate governmental action... (Art. 5:1). \nEach party shall ensure that judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative enforcement proceedings are avail-\nable under its law to sanction or remedy violations of its environmental laws and regulations. (Art. 5:2). \n \nMultilateral trade restrictions. These play an important role in multilateral envi-\nronmental agreements (MEAs). Their purpose is to deter non-compliance by parties to \nthe agreement (internal free-riding) and to encourage participation (deter external free-\nriding) (Neumayer 2001a). Many of the most important MEAs - the Montreal Protocol, \nthe Basel and Rotterdam Convention, the Convention on International Trade in Endan-\ngered Species - contain substantial trade restrictions (Neumayer 2000). Another prob-\nlem, which can be addressed by restrictive multilateral trade measures is so-called leak-\nage. Leakage describes the phenomenon that a decrease in emissions by the participants \n10 \nto an agreement is counter-acted by an increase of emissions by non-members. Such an \nincrease can be a deliberate decision by the free-riding countries or can be unintended. \nTo understand this point, take the example of carbon dioxide emissions. If a sub-set of \nall countries agrees on limiting their carbon dioxide emissions, then production of car-\nbon-intensive goods and services becomes relatively more expensive in these countries. \nComparative advantage in these goods and services shifts to the non-participating coun-\ntries who increase their production of carbon-intensive goods and services. Similarly, \nsome especially carbon-intensive industries might migrate from signatory to non-\nsignatory countries. Also, the reduction in demand for fossil fuels due to the limitation \nof carbon dioxide emissions by the participants to the agreement will lower world fossil \nfuel prices which increases demand for fossil fuels in non-member countries. \nBorder tax adjustments (BTAs). These are defined as the imposition of a domestic tax \non an imported good, which has been taxed either not at all or at a level less than the \ndomestic tax, and the remission of a domestic tax on products to be exported.3 \nSubsidies. These could be granted in the form of per unit of production or lump-sump \npayments to \u2018footloose\u2019, pollution-intensive or energy-intensive industries. \n \nI will apply the following set of criteria in assessing these options: \n \n\u2022 Effective: A policy option should achieve its objective of combating \u2018regulatory \nchill\u2019. \n\u2022 Politically realistic: A policy option should be politically realistic. Otherwise it has \nno chance of being realised. \n\u2022 Closed to abuse: A policy option should not be open to abuse by protectionist fac-\ntions in high standard countries under flimsy environmental pretexts. \n11 \n\u2022 Not unnecessarily restrictive: A policy option should not restrict international flows \nof capital and trade beyond the necessary extent. It is this author\u2019s conviction that a \nliberal capital and trade regime is desirable, ceteris paribus. \n \n3.2 Effective \nThe introduction of minimum standards in itself is likely to be ineffective. The essential \nproblem of \u2018environmental chill\u2019 is that countries fail to raise standards above other \ncountries\u2019 standards for fear of capital flight. This fear might be alleviated, but will not \nbe overcome by setting a minimum standard, which will merely mean that those coun-\ntries with the lowest standards have to raise their standards to the minimum. A \u2018com-\npetitive disadvantage\u2019 can still be perceived relative to countries at the minimum stan-\ndard. The same applies to countries above the minimum standard, but below the current \nor future raised standard of the country considering raising its standards. Minimum \nstandards can be more effective if they themselves are raised continuously, because then \nthe environmental frontrunners can trust that their advance will sooner or later be \nmatched by proportional increases in the minimum standards faced by other countries. \nWhether harmonisation of standards is an effective policy option depends on what \nkind of harmonisation occurs. If harmonisation is downward, that is if high standards \ncountries lower their standards considerably more than low standards countries raise \ntheirs in order to agree on a common, but relatively low, standard, then this option will \nbe completely ineffective. Instead of overcoming the obstacles to raising environmental \nstandards, these same standards are lowered. Things can be different if harmonisation is \nupward, however. In this case, high standards countries will lower their standards con-\nsiderably less than low standards countries raise theirs. In the extreme case, they might \nnot lower their standards at all. Because countries now agree on a common, but rela-\n12 \ntively high, standard, advanced countries have then less reason to fear that further rais-\ning their standards will lead to considerable loss of capital. However, high standards \ncountries might only induce low standards countries to agree on upward harmonisation \nif they commit to not further raising their standards or, more realistically, if they commit \nto not insisting on further rounds of upward harmonisation in case they raised their stan-\ndards after the initial upward harmonisation. In other words, upward harmonisation of \nstandards might only be achievable at the expense of excluding or at least making more \ndifficult further upward harmonisations. In this case, \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 would only be \nalleviated once, but not permanently. \nEnforcement agreements are likely to be ineffective in overcoming regulatory chill \nas they do nothing to raise standards, but merely attempt to enforce existing standards. \nThey might even lead to the perverse effect of exacerbating the problem. This is because \nit might impose a further fear on a country contemplating a rise in environmental stan-\ndards: that it would be obliged via international agreement to enforce these higher stan-\ndards. \nMultilateral trade restrictions can be effective if they are part of the instruments of a \nmultilateral environmental agreement (MEA) to ensure compliance with the treaty and \ndeter free-riding. The idea is that instead of unilateral action a multitude of countries \nagree on raising their respective environmental standards. This collective action over-\ncomes the prisoner\u2019s dilemma in which countries facing \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 are caught: \ncountries would like to raise their environmental standards, but only if all other coun-\ntries raise their respective standards as well since otherwise the costs of loss of capital \nare feared to outweigh the benefits from unilateral standard raising. But, in order to be \nsuccessful, this kind of collective action needs to ensure compliance of the participating \ncountries (deter internal free-riding). Also, it needs to ensure that as many countries as \n13 \npossible participate in the multilateral agreement. That is, external free-riding needs to \nbe deterred. Trade restrictions can be an effective instrument to deter both internal as \nwell as external free-riding (Barrett 1997). If they are effective, then they can overcome \n\u2018regulatory chill\u2019. \nSubsidies to \u2018footloose\u2019 or pollution-intensive or energy-intensive industries can in \nprinciple be an effective policy option. If they fully compensate the industries for any \ncost increases due to higher environmental standards then there is no incentive for these \nindustries to flee the country. However, depending on the way in which subsidies take \nplace the initial environmental objective can become partly defeated. If some industrial \nsectors receive an implicit subsidy in simply exempting them from the taxes or offering \nthem a lower tax rate, then the environmental benefits will be lower than they would \notherwise be.4 Alternatively, the tax rates facing all non-exempted agents have to be \nraised to secure achieving the same level of environmental benefits. Also, exemption of \ncertain industries from taxation leads to all sorts of inter-sectoral allocative inefficien-\ncies. Furthermore, it will attract firms into the subsidised industries as it raises their rela-\ntive profitability. If the \u2018footloose\u2019 industries are also pollution-intensive industries, this \nre-allocation of capital will again partly defeat the environmental objective. To avoid the \nnegative effects of subsidisation on the environmental benefits achieved, the full tax rate \nshould equally apply to all industries and the \u2018footloose\u2019 industries should receive a \nlump-sum subsidy to compensate them for their total cost increases. It should be noted, \nhowever, that this option will still lead to allocative inefficiencies as subsidised indus-\ntries become more profitable relative to non-subsidised industries. \nBTAs can in principle be an effective policy option. If foreign competitors have to \npay the differential in environmental compliance cost at the border and if domestic ex-\nporters are fully compensated for complying with higher environmental standards, then \n14 \nthere is no incentive for capital to flee the country. However, because compensating \ndomestic exporters for cost differentials is equivalent to providing them with a subsidy, \nBTAs can face the same kind of problems with allocative inefficiencies and defeat of \nthe environmental objectives as discussed with respect to subsidies above. The higher is \nthe share of domestic production that becomes exported, the more prevalent will these \nproblems become. \n \n3.3 Politically realistic \nThe introduction of minimum standards as well as the harmonisation of international \nstandards or an enforcement agreement does not currently seem to be pursued with any \ngreat vigour by developed countries, at least outside the EU. Even within the EU there is \nno great momentum apparent towards the harmonisation of environment-related taxes. \nHowever, should developed countries decide to pursue harmonisation there would be no \nhindrances by international trade rules as the WTO does not prohibit consensually \nagreed upon minimum or harmonised standards. The same is true with respect to an \nenforcement agreement. \nTrade restrictions have become a common instrument in MEAs. Their consistency \nwith WTO rules is not entirely clear, but no MEA related trade restriction has ever been \nchallenged before the WTO (for more information, see Neumayer 2001b, chapter 9). \nWhat is of interest here is whether the MEAs themselves are politically realistic. Multi-\nlateral action with respect to the environment is often difficult to bring about, takes a \nlong time and is regarded by many environmentalists as insufficient since countries tend \nto agree on the lowest common denominator. The Kyoto Protocol represents a case in \npoint: It took nearly six years after the Rio Summit to conclude a binding agreement. \nThe past difficulties in bringing about this agreement are legendary as are, and even \n15 \nmore so, the future difficulties of bringing the Protocol into force and of deciding on the \nmany particularities left unaddressed. Indeed, one of the issues still to be addressed is \nwhether and how trade restrictions should play a role in ensuring compliance and deter-\nring free-riding. Finally, many environmentalists consider the Protocol as falling so \nmuch short of what they regard as necessary action that presumably they would regard \nthe Protocol as further proof for \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 rather than as a significant step to-\nwards its overcoming. \nBTAs are usually liked by domestic policy makers who find the notion that foreign \ncompetitors must face the same environmental compliance costs as domestic producers \nappealing. However, BTAs can clash with international trade rules. WTO rules allow \nBTAs for taxes on environmentally-damaging products, which are quite common. They \nalso allow for BTAs for product-related environmental taxes, as can be seen by a WTO \npanel decision upholding a US tax on luxury cars and a gas guzzler tax (WTO 1994). \nBTAs for non-product related taxes, usually known as taxes on process and production \nmethods (PPM), are much less common, but there are two prominent examples. One is \nBTA for chemicals manufactured using base chemicals as feedstock, which were subject \nto product taxation in the US. As this tax was part of the US Superfund Amendments \nand Reauthorization Act of 1986 it is commonly referred to in the literature as the super-\nfund tax. The other example is BTA for ozone-depleting chemicals, which were subject \nto product taxation in the US as part of its effort to phase out the production and use of \nthese substances. Whereas the BTA for the ozone-tax was never challenged under the \nrules of the international trade regime, the BTA for the superfund tax was. In 1987 a \nGATT panel basically upheld the BTA for the superfund tax because the taxed input \nwas to some extent physically incorporated in the final product (GATT 1987). If, on the \nother hand, the taxed input is not physically incorporated in the final product, then the \n16 \nrelevant WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures does not seem to \nallow for BTA.5 As most environmentally relevant inputs into the production process do \nnot become physically incorporated in the final product, WTO rules would forbid the \nuse of BTA for most cases in which countries would want to apply them. Furthermore, \nWTO rules do not allow for BTAs for cost differences that follow implicitly from higher \nenvironmental standards if these higher standards are not realised via higher taxes or \ncharges, but via command-and-control or other forms of regulation instead. That the \nrelevant WTO rules could be reformed to allow for general PPM related BTAs is highly \nunlikely. First, there does not seem to be strong support for such a reform even among \nthe developed countries. Brack, Grubb and Windram (2000, p. 86f.) cite a letter from a \nUS Trade Representative official referring to an informal (\u2018Gentlemen\u2019) agreement \namong developed countries to the effect that the Agreement on Subsidies and Counter-\nvailing Measures \n \nwas never intended to fundamentally expand the right of countries to apply border adjustment for a \nbroad range of taxes on energy, especially in the developed world (...). We discussed the matter with other \ndeveloped countries involved in the Subsidies Code negotiations. We are satisfied that they share our \nviews on the purpose of the text as drafted and the importance of careful international examination before \nany broader policy conclusions should be drawn regarding border adjustment and energy taxes. \n \nSecond, because a reform of WTO rules would need a two third majority according \nto Art. X:3 of the Agreement Establishing the WTO, developing countries would need \nto consent as well. However, they are completely against such a reform as they rightly \nfear that they would be affected by BTAs as well (or even predominantly so) and not \njust developed countries themselves (ICTSD 1999). \n17 \nSubsidies seem to be politically realistic as they might be considered an easy option \nless overtly intrusive into foreign countries\u2019 rights. However, as they might be regarded \nas giving domestic industries an unfair advantage they might still be regarded as harmful \nto foreign countries and might therefore clash with international trade rules. The WTO\u2019s \nAgreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measured distinguishes between subsidies \nthat are widely available within the economy and subsidies that are specific to certain \nenterprises, industries or regions (Art. 2). It imposes rules only on the latter category. \nSpecific subsidies are prohibited if they are contingent on export performance or local \ncontent (Art. 3). Otherwise, with few exceptions, they are actionable, that is subject to \nchallenge if they cause adverse effects to the interests of another WTO member country. \nTo cause adverse effects, a subsidy must cause injury and serious prejudice to the indus-\ntry of another country which would nullify or impair its benefits under the GATT treaty \n(Art. 5). As serious prejudice is difficult to prove, there exists a presumption of serious \nprejudice if subsidies are greater than 5 per cent ad valorem, cover operating losses or \naccrue in the form of direct forgiveness of debt (Art. 6). One of the types of subsidies \nexcepted from the rules laid down in the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Counter-\nvailing Measures and therefore non-actionable is assistance to adapt existing industries \nto new environmental requirements (Art. 8.2 (c)). However, to qualify such assistance \nmust occur only once, not cover more than 20 per cent of the adaptation costs and has to \nbe made available to all firms which can adopt the new equipment and processes. As \nmost subsidies would not fall in this category and could well exceed 5 per cent ad \nvalorem of benefited firms, subsidies to prevent capital flight might be challenged under \nWTO rules. This has not been tested yet as there has been no dispute over this kind of \nsubsidies so far, but it could well be that this policy option becomes partly barred and \ntherefore rendered politically unrealistic. \n18 \n \n3.4 Closed to abuse \nMinimum standards as well as harmonisation of standards and an international enforce-\nment agreement are relatively closed to abuse as they depend on the consent of all par-\nties involved. Things are different with trade restrictions, which partly are targeted to-\nwards non-participating and therefore non-consenting parties. These restrictions can be \nabused as participating countries (or a subset of them) might install restrictions against \nnon-participants under the pretext of fulfilling its mandatory obligations according to a \nMEA, but with proper protectionist intentions instead. BTAs and subsidies are also open \nto abuse. They open a pandora\u2019s box in that all sorts of industries will lobby policy \nmakers to grant them protection from \u2018unfair\u2019 foreign competition. The incentive for \nprotectionist abuse might be higher with BTAs relative to subsidies, as subsidies cost \nmoney to the domestic taxpayers, whereas in the case of BTAs the costs are partly borne \nby the foreign producers and partly, but much less visibly, by higher prices for domestic \nconsumers. \n \n3.5 Not unnecessarily restrictive \nMinimum standards as well as harmonisation of standards are not very restrictive in the \nsense that once the standards have been established capital as well as goods and services \nare allowed to cross borders without constraint. However, in so far as some countries\u2019 \nenvironmental standards might rise above their efficiency levels, these countries would \nbe implicitly confronted with inefficient restrictions towards their exports of goods and \nservices. An enforcement agreement is not restrictive at all as it merely aspires to ensure \nthat a country\u2019s existing laws and regulations are actually enforced. Trade restrictions \nare restrictive by definition. However, if trade restrictions as an instrument of a MEA to \n19 \nensure compliance and deter free-riding are fully effective, then ironically they will not \nbe restrictive at all, as there is no need to employ them. The best restrictions are the ones \nthat will never come into force. BTAs can be restrictive as well. If they are applied in a \nprotectionist or non-transparent manner then they will restrict the flow of capital and \ngoods and services. Subsidies can be restrictive as well if they are applied in a protec-\ntionist manner. If they are then they will distort the comparative advantage of countries \nsuch that the non-subsidising countries would face implicit restrictions towards their \nexports of goods and services and their import of capital. \n \n4 Conclusion \nIn a world of imperfect information about what constitutes efficient environmental stan-\ndards, it is not easy to assess whether countries inefficiently fail to raise their standards \nor not. \u2018Regulatory chill\u2019 is a potentially serious, but difficult to detect phenomenon. As \none is looking at counterfactual claims, the researcher has to rely on anecdotal evidence. \nSome of this evidence has been presented in this article. It seems fair to say that \u2018regula-\ntory chill\u2019 has not been proven - neither in general nor with respect to the case of reduc-\ning greenhouse gas emissions. But enough evidence is there to warrant an evaluation of \npolicy options to address the (potential) problem of \u2018regulatory chill\u2019, which this articles \nhas attempted to do. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the findings on evaluating policy options. As can be \nseen, no option fares clearly better than all others. However, harmonisation of standards \nand multilateral trade restrictions do relatively well on our criteria so that they are rec-\nommended here as policy options to deal with potential \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 problems. The \nchallenge with harmonisation of standards would be to strive for upward rather than \ndownward harmonisation to make it effective in overcoming \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 and to \n20 \ngather political support to make it more politically realistic than it currently seems to be. \nAs experience with the EU has shown, one way to facilitate upward harmonisation is to \nmake increased usage of majority voting in place of an unanimity requirement. The \nchallenge with multilateral capital and trade restrictions would be to gather political \nsupport for fast and effective multilateral action on international and global environ-\nmental problems. \n \n< INSERT TABLE 1 HERE > \n \nHow these challenges can be met, that is, what can be done to facilitate upward har-\nmonisation and multilateral environmental action is beyond the scope of this paper and \nthe subject of ongoing research. Another objective of future research would be an ex-\namination of the evidence with respect to \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 on issues other than global \nwarming. If \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 really is a significant and widespread phenomenon, then \nthe payoff to research demonstrating its evidence and finding ways to overcome it will \nbe very high indeed in terms of achieving sustainable development. This is because, as \nmentioned in the introduction, \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 is inimical to the very idea of sustain-\nable development which requires that countries are not deterred from raising their envi-\nronmental standards for fear of capital flight. \nAnother possibility would be, of course, to try to convince policy makers that their \nobsession with \u2018competitiveness\u2019 is misguided: countries do not compete with each \nother the way businesses do, hence they cannot really gain or lose \u2018competitiveness\u2019 \n(Krugman 1994). But here, as in so many other areas, what really matters is what policy \nmakers believe, not what economic theory and evidence says, and there can be no doubt \n21 \nthat they actually do believe that countries compete with each other. To fight against \ntheir preoccupation with \u2018competitiveness\u2019 is therefore likely to be a waste of time. \n \n5 Acknowledgement \nI would like to thank two anonymous referees for helpful comments. \n \nREFERENCES \nAPI (2000) What is the U.S. oil and natural gas industry\u2019s position on the Kyoto Proto-\ncol?, American Petroleum Industry, Washington D.C. \nArden-Clarke, C.

The companies mainly come from the steel, oil, agriculture, electricity, rail and chemical indus-\ntries. The associations include such important ones as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the National Mining Association. GCC lost \nseveral prominent members, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP Amoco, DaimlerChrysler, Ford and Texaco. \nShell and BP changed their position and support the Kyoto Protocol by now and Chrysler had to change \nits position after being taken over by Daimler. Ford and Texaco, on the other hand, left the coalition \nmerely for image reasons as they considered their continued membership to be detrimental to their reputa-\ntion. However, both companies have pledged to continue opposing the Kyoto Protocol as well as any \nother mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts (BNA 1999, BNA 2000). \n2\n As a substitute EU countries are now considering the imposition of minimum excise duties to a \nwide range of energy products. However, even this rather minimalist solution is currently blocked by \nopposition from environmental \u2018laggers\u2019 such as Ireland and Spain (ENS 1999). \n3\n Note that BTAs are only applicable for the imposition of a tax. They are not to be confused with \nso-called eco-tariffs, which are supposed to compensate for international differences in environmental \ncompliance costs, whether these differences are due to taxes or not. Daly (1993, p. 26), for example, de-\nmands that \u2018whoever sells in a nation\u2019s market should play by that nation\u2019s rules or pay a tariff sufficient \nto remove the competitive advantages of lower standards\u2019. Arden-Clarke (1993, p. 81) from the World \nWide Fund for Nature (WWF) wants \u2018environmental leaders\u2019 to be able to \u2018take trade measures that \u201clevel \nthe playing field\u201c between environmentally sound and unsound goods.\u2019 The International Pollution Deter-\nrence Act, unsuccessfully introduced into the 102d U.S. Congress as motion S.984 by Senator Boren (D-\nOK), called for countervailing duties equivalent to the cost that it would take a foreign firm to comply \nwith U.S. domestic environmental standards (OTA 1992, p. 92). \n4\n This is the case, for example, with the German ecological tax reform, where energy-intensive \nmanufacturing firms can get a rebate on their tax. The draft European Council Directive in its Article 10 \npomised this rebate for all energy-intensive firms. Similar exemptions apply with respect to the Danish \nand Swedish carbon\/energy taxes (Brack, Grubb and Windram 2000). \n27 \n                                                                                                                                               \n5\n For a detailed explanation of the quite complicated legal issues involved see Brack, Grubb and \nWindram (2000, pp. 81-90); Schoenbaum (1997, pp. 308-312); D\u00fcerkop (1994, pp. 820-823). However, a \nfinal judgement on this question cannot be made as no WTO panel has ever decided on it. \n"}
