In particular, the work of Mann and Stewart (2000) has \nprovided details of many studies by researchers who have used web-based qualitative \nmethods to collect in-depth data. For example approaches such as focus groups, chat \nrooms and conferences have been used to explore on-line experiences in synchronous \nreal-time (O\u2019Connor and Madge 2001, Eichorn 2001). Amongst other aspects, this \nliterature has explored the methodological possibilities of email as a medium for on-\nline research in asynchronous non-real-time. Now there is interest in its \nmethodological development to support qualitative approaches in educational \nresearch (Foster 1994, Russell and Bullock 1999 and Henson et al 2000) and \norganisational research (Morgan and Symon 2004). \n \nIn this paper we intend to contribute to this development, by exploring the \nmethodological issues we encountered when using email as a medium for qualitative \ninterviewing. By drawing on two separate small scale research studies with tertiary \nlevel educators that used email interviewing to explore participants\u2019 understandings \nof their professional experiences and developing professional identities we consider \ntwo key areas: the establishment of credibility throughout the research process \n(Lincoln and Guba 1985) and the authenticity of the voices of the participants in \nterms of power and control in the interview process. Using email interviewing led us \nto question whether the procedures we had used addressed sufficiently these key \nparameters of qualitative research. None the less the opportunities for holding \nasynchronous conversations with distant participants through email and the reflective \n 4 \ndata that can be generated, drew us to conclude that it is worth refining these \nprocedures to strengthen the credibility and trustworthiness of such studies using this \nmethod.  \n \n \nMethodological Considerations in Qualitative Web-based Research \n \nIn drawing on our experiences of using email interviewing, both our studies explored \nparticipants\u2019 understandings of their professional experiences and developing \nprofessional identities, but in different contexts. One of the studies focused on the \nreflections of nine psychology lecturers and the construction of their professional \nidentities both as teachers in higher education and within the main communities in \nwhich they worked. Interviewing emphasised the experiential (Connelly and \nClandinin 1986) and was intended to explore the developing professional stories that \nbecame the basis for their professional identities, as well as exploring their \nunderstandings of their experiences as lived and told stories. They were invited to \ncomment on: the images they used to construct professional identity and shape \nprofessional practice; the way in which professional identity was managed within the \ncommunities in which they lived and worked; the values and knowledge-base of their \nwork as teachers; and how fundamental these communities were to their teacher \nprofessionalism.  \n \nThe other study focused, through semi-structured interviews, on ten adult educators \nwho were doctoral students and their views on coming to terms with being part-time \nstudents following an extended campus programme of study of an English university. \n 5 \nThey were asked to reflect on the excitements and concerns of being a student and \nhow these were shaped by underlying cultural conflicts between the expectations of \ntheir own cultural milieux, which they experienced in their everyday lives, and those \nof the university they attended, albeit as part-time students; on their relationships with \ntheir tutors as mediators of university custom and practice and gatekeepers to the \nacademy; and on their developing identities as doctoral level students.  Bourdieu et al \n(1994) explored the experiences of students in a French university and how they \nexperienced the process of becoming students and learning the discourses of \nsuccessful practice through their encounters with the university system, especially as \nit was mediated by their tutors. This recognized that how students\u2019 made sense of \ntheir experiences is shaped by the tensions they experience between their \npowerlessness as students, their wish to be successful in gaining membership of a \nparticular academic discourse community and the power located in a university \nsystem. In this study participants\u2019 processes of sense making were further \ncomplicated because many of them used English as their second or third language, \nhad never worked in the UK, and in some cases did not work in other institutions of \nhigher education.  \n \nIn carrying out our two independent studies we came to realise that our \nepistemological and methodological approach to the use of email interviewing shared \nsome similarities. We both wanted a research method that could capture and reflect \nnarrative accounts of participants\u2019 experiences and provoke their in-depth reflection \nof their understandings of their developing professional experiences and identities \n(Busher 2001, James 2003).  \n \n 6 \nIn constructing our studies, we considered the suitability of different types of \nqualitative interviews in terms of their design and ethics.  Face-to-face interviewing \noffered us a template with its processes for gaining consent and guaranteeing \nconfidentiality as well as the flexibility to gather data through the use of open \nquestions and follow-up discussion (Chen and Hinton 1999). However, our \nparticipants were located at a distance from us within and outside the UK. So we had \nto overcome the practical constraints (for example costs associated with travel, venue, \ndata transcription) of conducting the interviews necessary for our studies in a manner \nthat replicated as closely as possible, given these constraints, the normal processes of \nqualitative face-to-face interviewing.  \n \nWe considered telephone interviewing as an alternative approach since, such \ninterviews can be used to access hard-to-reach participants (Sturges and Hanrahan, \n2004). However, in one study, the different time zones between participants and \nresearcher would have made it difficult to agree a convenient time for conversations.  \nFurther, a key issue for us was the quality of data that we would collect because, as \nArksey and Knight (1999) note, the medium of telephone interviewing can generate \nshort answer responses in interviews, not the in-depth descriptive and reflective \naccounts that we were trying to elicit and hence, did not seem appropriate for our \nstudies.  \n \nEmail interviewing, we thought, was a medium that would allow us to facilitate in-\ndepth interviews, especially as all our participants had ready access to email and were \nfamiliar with using it in their professional lives. An asynchronous email exchange, as \nHenson et al (2000) discovered, encourages participants to explore and revisit their \n 7 \ninsights into their developing professional identities, allowing them to move back and \nforth through their narratives, thinking about their responses, drafting and redrafting \nwhat they want to write (Mann and Stewart 2000), creating, in effect a form of \nenriched interview. \n \nEmail also offered us the opportunity to \u2018interview\u2019 participants individually, \nnecessary for exploring their discrete views of their developing professional identities \nand life histories in a variety of different macro and organisational  cultures. Duranti \n(1997) and Cazden (2000) suggest that people with different social, cultural and \norganizational experiences, respond differently to questions about their professional \nlife stories. Street (1995), too, has argued that people\u2019s understanding of their \nidentities and communities, their construction of social literacies, are affected by their \ncultural locations. So group interviews constructed through web-board discussions did \nnot seem a relevant research tool. \n \n \nEstablishing credibility and trustworthiness  \n \nResearchers such as Lincoln and Guba (1985), Denzin and Lincoln (2000) and Flick \n(2002) have pointed to the need for qualitative researchers to be as vigilant as \npositivist researchers about ensuring the validity and reliability of their studies, even \nif they choose to use other terms such as credibility and authenticity, to describe the \nqualities that establish the trustworthiness of their studies. The design of these studies \ndrew on conventional approaches to interview-based qualitative research to guide \nconversations between a researcher and other participants in a study. Such interviews \n 8 \nuse a format that is either semi-structured or unstructured (Bryman, 2001). The \nquestions we asked of participants in our studies were supplemented by probes to \nexplore and gain a deeper understanding of issues as did Beattie (1995) in her \nresearch. These approaches were enhanced by us encouraging participants to explore \nand revisit their insights into their developing professional identities by thinking \nabout their responses, and drafting and redrafting what they wanted to write as some \nof our participants noted in Table 1 below. One participant reflected that the process \nhad made her wonder about the origins of her professional identity as a researcher\/ \npsychologist and was grateful for the time our questions had permitted her to use to \nthink about this. \n \n[Insert Table 1 here] \n \nThe iterative process of these interviews \u2013 that constantly reflective process that \nHammersley (1998) commends as a safeguard for qualitative researchers against the \nrisk that they might unwittingly fall short of the rigorous standards of probity that is \nrequired \u2013 also guarded against aspects of the interviews remaining underdeveloped. \nSo points that had been seemingly overlooked or only briefly responded to during \nearly parts of our interviews were able to be revisited later in the course of a \nconversation. Although participants may not have given a particular response at one \npoint in time, it did not mean that they were unaware of that issue in the exploration \nof professional identity or unable to write about it, merely that they chose not to do so \nat that particular point in the flow of the conversation. McCulloch et al (2000) took \nthe view on this that \u2018\u2026all that can be said is that the way the interview played out \n 9 \nmeant that the point was not spontaneously made at that time in that specific setting. \nAt another time, in another interview, the point might have been made\u2019 (p.122).  \n \n \nConsent, confidentiality and collaboration \n \nWe were concerned to ensure that the research processes were conducted in an ethical \nmanner (BERA, 2004) with participants giving us their informed voluntary consent to \nbeing involved with useful research that used processes of data collection and \ninterrogation that protected their privacy. Neither the voluntary nature of the consent \nnor the protection of privacy was unproblematic. The latter involved us in thinking \nvery carefully about how we kept records of our participants\u2019 conversations. As \nThach (1995) comments, the open nature of electronic networks makes it more \ndifficult to ensure participants\u2019 anonymity. Email systems automatically send \nparticipants\u2019 addresses along with their responses, so users are instantly visible.  \n \nTo assuage putative participants\u2019 fears about protecting their privacy we sent them \nrubrics about how the research would be conducted (see Tables 2a and 2b below) \nwhen seeking their informed consent to participate in the study. None the less, whilst \nnot questioning our integrity as researchers and our efforts to safeguard \nconfidentiality, some participants expressed concerns about the risk of email \ncommunications being passed on inadvertently to other parties. The need for privacy \nin our studies meant we could not send our participants a single group communication \nfor each question of our semi-structured interview schedules, since this might reveal \n 10 \nparticipants\u2019 identities to each other. This neutralised one of the key advantages of \nemail: communicating with many people at once.  \n \n[Insert Tables 2a and 2b here] \n \nThe voluntaristic nature of our participants\u2019 consent was problematic because we \nknew our participants professionally before we began these studies. Although we \nthought this would facilitate their willingness to engage with our projects \u2013 and there \nis evidence in participants\u2019 interviews that it did - our positions in our organisations \nrelative to our participants, especially in the case of the doctoral students, challenged \nthe nature of voluntarism. In the latter case in particular we feared that, as the \nresearcher was a tutor on their course, the asymmetrical power relationships that \nBourdieu et al (1994) noted between tutors and students would spill over into the \nresearch arena, inhibiting participants\u2019 responses as well as their choice of whether or \nnot to participate. That some putative participants did refuse to join the study when \napproached, and others dropped out early in its course suggested that voluntarism and \nself-interest rather than fear of the power of the tutor as gatekeeper to the academy \nwas probably the main reason for them participating.  \n \nCollaboration took various forms since, as educators, participants and ourselves were \nprofessionally interested in the processes and outcomes of this research. One form of \ncollaboration was through the record keeping processes of the studies. Given the \nlimited research methods literature on email interviewing, we adapted conventional \nframeworks of qualitative research to meet the needs of the new medium (see Tables \n2a and 2b above). The records of our conversations \u2013 akin to the tape-recorded \n 11 \nrecords of face to face interviews \u2013 were not erased as the emails bounced back and \nforth between the researchers and the other participants, and were kept intact in the \nchronological sequence of the discussions. This enabled participants\u2019 and researchers \nto reflect in an iterative manner on their developing conversations and, in due course, \nallowed participants to consider the accuracy of the texts of our conversations, \nestablishing the authenticity of them.  \n \nAnother form was in the research relationships we set out to build, engaging both the \nresearchers and participants, as Oakley (1981) noted, beyond stereotypic roles of \nquestion-asking and question-answering. We thought that this approach would lead to \ngreater disclosure, mutuality and reciprocity between the researcher and the \nparticipants so that we could, \u2018\u2026acquire an understanding of the participant\u2019s \nperspective through open and honest dialogue\u2026\u2019 (Anderson and Kanuka 2003, p.88). \nLebesco (2004), too, found that a collaborative approach helped her to gain rapport \nwith her participants. Markham (2004) points out, \u2018\u2026methodologically we should not \nignore this feature because as interaction constructs and reflects the shape of the \nphenomena being studied, interaction also delineates the being doing the research in \nthe field\u2019 (p.147). As the interviews developed, the participants began to take greater \nownership of the processes of narrative construction by responding to our questions in \nunexpected ways and directions. As researchers, we responded to the new directions \nof their narratives by asking further questions about their texts rather than sticking to \nthe agenda of the original interview schedule which would have enforced our control \nof the interview process. \n \n 12 \nOur pre-existing professional relationships with participants made it less necessary for \nus to build a scaffold for developing trust, needed if participants are unknown to \nresearchers. The depth of participants\u2019 responses to our questions might have been \nattributable to this prior interpersonal knowledge, as in Wicksteed\u2019s research (2000). \nThe participants\u2019 lack of inhibition and frankness, like those in the study of Holge-\nHazelton (2002), which emerged in their more personal narratives and were bound up \nin dimensions of their lives, might also have been a consequence of these pre-existing \nrelationships. One commented on how she coped with what she perceived as the \ncontradictions of her professional identity, especially now she had applied for early \nretirement. This challenged her to consider how she might then signify her identity \nwhen she no longer had the framework of her professional work. However, this level \nof self-exposure also reinforced the participants\u2019 authentic behaviour (Mann and \nStewart 2000). \n \nOne of the problems facing researchers using interviews is that the outcomes of \nconversations can be distorted because people interpret the social characteristics of \nthe other, such as age, race, gender and organisational status, to shape their responses \nto fit whatever pattern of sense making seems to be being required of them (Sproull \nand Kiesler, 1986, Mann and Stewart 2000). Researchers\u2019 values and attitudes can be \nconveyed to participants not only by researchers\u2019 social characteristics but also by \ntheir non-verbal and verbal cues. On the face of it, email hides many of these personal \nand social characteristics (Thach, 1995). However as we were already known to our \nparticipants the shield which email might have provided (Mann and Stewart, 2000) \nagainst the influence of these factors was ineffective. \n \n 13 \nIf the presence of social signals is problematic for participants and researchers in \ninterview-based research, so is their absence. We recognised that the nonverbal and \ncontextual elements that are seen as essential to the interviewing process (Anderson \nand Kanuka 2003) would be absent in our studies because of using text-based \ninteractions. The lack of personal contact inherent in the email interview process was \ncommented on adversely by some participants. Slow responses by the researchers to \nparticipants\u2019 queries about the research process or the meaning of some questions, \nseemed to further weaken participants\u2019 sense of some ownership of the research \nconversations (see Tables 2a and 2b above). These factors tended to deprive \nparticipants of a sense of engagement in a human conversation and of a sense of \nsecurity of knowing, even if incorrectly, who a researcher is socially, making them \nless willing to continue in the research conversations.  \n \nThis points to the importance of the socio-emotional aspects of interviewing and as \nKnight and Saunders (1999) comment, on the need for researchers who engage in \nweb-based research to use different ways to build trust and to encourage participants \nto \u2018open up.\u2019 Paccagnella (1997) suggested that on-line research can identify the \nexistence of \u2018\u2026strategies of visibility\u2026which make up for the lack of traditional \nsocial cues and which indeed permit the development of a status differentiation\u2026\u2019 \nHowever, such strategies do not seem to be as powerful in shaping conversations as \nthe social presence of a researcher with participants. In one study, the absence of \nvisual cues seemed to make it easier for some participants to start and terminate their \ninterviews as and when it suited them despite text-based cues such as: \u2018Haven\u2019t heard \nfrom you in a while. I wondered if you still wished to continue the interview?\u2019 from \nthe researcher. \n 14 \n \n \nPresentation and power: Whose voice is it anyway?  \n \nOf major importance in interpretative research is that of clarifying whose voices are \nheard, those of the participant(s) or that of the researcher, and of establishing that \nparticipants\u2019 voices are heard clearly and reflect accurately the views they hold. As \nGatson and Zweerink (2004) remark, the \u2018management of presence and presentation\u2019 \n(p.191) are crucial in the conduct of research. In both our studies this was problematic \nbecause of the pre-existing relationships between researchers and participants. In one \nstudy in particular this was problematic because the researcher was also a tutor for \nparticipants\u2019 doctoral studies. Other researchers, such as Lincoln and Guba (1985), \nDenzin and Lincoln (2000) and Flick (2002) have pointed to the need for qualitative \nresearchers to be vigilant in ensuring the authenticity of the voices of their \nparticipants.  \n \nOne concern we had was that the interview responses of the participants might not \nhave been entirely their own thoughts (Chen and Hinton 1999). We assumed that \nbecause our participants responded to us on their usual email addresses that it was \nthey who were responding \u2013 but we had no visual evidence of that as a researcher \nwould have in a face-to-face interview. Had we \u2018cold-called\u2019 this would have made it \ndifficult for us to know whether the online identity presented to us was that of the \nparticipant or an invented alias, or another person using somebody else\u2019s email \naddress.  \n \n 15 \nAnother concern was that, despite our efforts to engage the participants in agreeing \nthe accuracy of the records of their conversations and reflecting on the credibility of \nour interpretations of these conversations, we were never entirely sure to what depth \nthe participants had actually agreed to these records. For example, one participant \npointed out that \u2018in email communication clarification is not always easy\u2019 especially \nif there are time lapses in message exchanges and participants could not remember \nwhat they had said previously. However, the linkage between the participants\u2019 voices \nand the researchers\u2019 interpretations of the themes emerging in them was reflected in \nthe conceptual models that emerged from our studies (see Busher 2001 and James \n2003 for a more detailed methodological account). \n \nA third concern was how to develop participants\u2019 reflexivity with their texts. Asking \nparticipants in a study to reflect critically on their narratives helps researchers not \nonly to authenticate participants\u2019 accounts but also to develop a greater understanding \nof the phenomena being studied (Seale, 1999). It also helped our participants to re-\nvisit issues that they considered important but had slipped temporarily out of view \n(Russell and Bullock 1999). We tried to give our participants\u2019 the experience of \nengaging in an iterative discussion of their changing professional lives in a variety of \norganisational cultures through varying presentations of the self, rather than by either \nthe researcher\u2019s questions alone or the participants\u2019 concerns (Cooper and MacIntyre \n1996). Consequently, the records of the conversations were constantly under review \nand being authenticated as each new question and its responses were added to the \nexisting record of the email trail.  \n \n 16 \nHowever, this degree of reflection also generated a different issue for us: to what \nextent did the moderated and modified reflections of participants\u2019 on their \nexperiences generate an authentic account of those experiences and of how \nparticipants made sense of them? As Mann and Stewart (2000) have also reflected, \ndid the time for reflection provide a \u2018safeguard\u2019 because our participants were able to \nedit the text to convey the meanings they really intended?  \n \nThe construction of professional identity includes a dimension of complexity and \nfluidity (Giola and Thomas 1996). It is inextricably linked with who we are, our \ncommitments and values and is \u2018integral and continuous\u2019 (Kendal 1999). As Mann \nand Stewart (2000) remark,  \u2018For this reason it is seen to be difficult to sustain a \npersona which is quite divorced from the \u201creal\u201d self\u2019 (p.210). Processes of reflection \non personal texts and narratives do not only happen in interviews and on-line \nexchanges but in everyday life, too. People tend to review and rewrite their histories \nand perspectives in the light of their developing experiences. So to this extent, \nencouraging participants to reflect on their views did not necessarily undermine the \nauthenticity of their accounts. Indeed, it may have enriched them so long as we were \ncareful to avoid, intentionally or unintentionally, indicating what sort of answers we \nwere seeking through the way we constructed our questions. \n \nA fourth concern was our power as researchers to control the flow and development \nof the interviews. Naively, when we began our studies we thought \u2018email brings \npeople into contact \u2026 and places each on equal ground\u2019 (Boshier, 1990, p.51) and \nconsidered email had the potential to democratise narrative exchanges (Illingworth, \n2001). As the interviews progressed we began to wonder whether email did indeed \n 17 \ndemocratise the process of research by creating a more equitable process of social \ninteraction between researchers and participants.  \n \nAt the start of our interviews we were in more powerful positions epistemologically \nthan were our participants, not least because we shaped the agenda of the discussions \nand had access to the relevant literatures underpinning the conceptual frameworks of \nthe studies (Easterby-Smith et al, 1991). We were also in more powerful positions \nbureaucratically because, as Carter  (1993) pointed out, we created the organisational \nstructures of the studies by providing the interview schedules and the \u2018rules of \nengagement\u2019 as discussed above.  \n \nDespite our fears that we might be exerting undue overt and covert control of the \nresearch process, through time it became apparent that the participants exercised \ninfluence, too. Interviews that had been scheduled by the researchers to take a matter \nof two to three weeks eventually extended in many cases over several months, \nbecause this speed of responses suited participants in the busy press of their daily \nlives (see Table 1 above). The medium of email allowed them this control over the \nresearch dialogues. It slowed up the whole research process considerably, despite \nmany requests from the researchers in the early phases of the interviews for \nparticipants\u2019 to respond within three working days. In face-to-face interviews \nresearchers are able to exert greater control, usually being able to keep conversations \nto a pre-determined agenda and prevent them extending beyond their allotted time, if \nnot to prevent participants curtailing interviews because of other social or work-\nrelated pressures. \n \n 18 \nSome participants initially apologised profusely for being late with their answers, \nindicating their acknowledgement of the power they perceived the researchers as \nhaving in controlling \u2018their\u2019 research projects, into which the participants had been \ninvited. Gradually, however, researchers and participants alike came to accept these \n\u2018delays\u2019 as the normal, if unexpected pace of this email based research process. It was \nmarkedly different from the rhythm of the semi-structured face-to-face research \nconversations (Robson, 1993) that we were trying to mimic online. Indeed we \neventually came to discover like Russell and Bullock (1999), that an exciting element \nof the process was that we never quite knew when we were going to get a response \nfrom whom. It also released our time for pursuing our other professional duties, \nwhich did not really allow us to sustain the time schedule for the research dialogues \nthat we had set.  \n \nPrompt replies, we discovered, were not actually necessary, particularly when slower \nones gave opportunity for more powerful reflection on the main focus of the studies. \nLike Selwyn and Robson (1998) we discovered that asynchronicity was an attractive \nand creative feature of email interviewing. The shift in power, from researcher driven \nsemi-structured interview schedules to a more collaboratively constructed one that \nwas responsive to participants\u2019 needs for using time, also turned out to be fruitful in \nimproving the quality of participants\u2019 reflections. We noticed that participants who \ndid not respond immediately tended to generate more thoughtful answers and insights \non the construction of their professional identities, as one researcher reflected in a \nresearch diary. A participant commented: \n \n 19 \n\u2018I didn\u2019t email you straight back, because I was thinking about my answer. So \nmy responses were more carefully thought through and probably longer than if \nI\u2019d tackled the whole thing in a face-to-face interview \u2026 This is what\u2019s good \nabout the email process \u2026\u2019  \n \nAs the process of interviewing became more naturalistic (Robson 1993), so, perhaps \nunsurprisingly, the richness of the narratives increased. In other ways, too, \nparticipants gradually took more control over the direction of the agenda, by \nresponding and reflecting further on particular points during the interviews, leaving us \nmerely to moderate them. It allowed participants to elaborate their own thinking \nabout those aspects of professional identity that were important to them (see Table 1).  \n \nHowever this strengthening of participants\u2019 control raised the potential risk of the \ninterviews having an increasingly selective focus (Connelly and Clandinin, 2000) and \nthe risk that important points might not be fully discussed or poorly developed, as the \nroutes the conversations took became ones we had not originally anticipated. The \ninterview schedules remained as aide-memoires to help us to avoid such narrowing of \nfoci. The changing nature of these interviews through time, as semi-structured \ninterviews subtly merged into unstructured approaches, highlights the difficulty of \nclinically categorising research methods, and shows how control of the research \nprocess slipped from the grasp of the researchers, at least to some extent. \n \nConclusion \n \n 20 \nThe email based research interviews were set up in a semi-structured format to pursue \na specific agenda that had been pre-selected by the researchers in order to gain a \ndeeper understanding of the issues in which we were interested, although they \neventually developed a more egalitarian shape of conversations between fellow \nprofessionals. Like Beattie (1995), our conversations with participants made use of \nsome of the specific features of email, such as the possibility of asynchronous \nconversations and the capacity to track conversations and reflect on a continuous \ndeveloping record of them, to encourage extensive reflection by participants\u2019 on their \nprofessional experiences.  \n \nThe feature of asynchronicity facilitated the exploration of busy professional \nparticipants\u2019 reflections on their lives and identities in the midst of their experiences. \nIt enabled participants, who might not otherwise have been able to take part in a study \nto do so, as Bampton and Cowton (2002) also remarked in their research. Through the \ncreation of on-line narratives we were able to gain access to the stories of their \nexperiences and their reflections on those. The development of these reflexive \ndiscourses improved serendipitously as we relinquished some of our control of the \ninterview schedules. This allowed participants to take greater ownership of their \nnarratives by being able to alter the shape and structure of them to fit more closely \nwith their own constructions of reality. That they were able to pursue this at a time \nand space convenient to them through the medium of email led, we believe, to richer \nstories.  \n \nThe continuous and visible record of the email interviews in every exchange enabled \nparticipants to revisit issues that had slipped temporarily out of view through the \n 21 \ncourse of their interviews  (Russell and Bullock 1999), because they could return to \nearlier aspects of the interview at their convenience and remind themselves of their \nearlier interpretations of their lives. As illustrated earlier in this paper, this seems to \nhave provoked a richness of reflection among the participants in both studies beyond \nwhat we would have expected had we pursued rigorously semi-structured interview \nschedules and not allowed participants to develop their own narratives in ways that \nwere meaningful to them. Morgan and Symon (2004) too noted that, \u2018\u2026this potential \nincrease in reflexivity\u2026may be considered to be a very positive aspect of the \nmedium\u2026 \u2018because it makes the socially constructed nature of  \u201creality\u201d more \ntransparent\u2019 (p.31). The iterative discussions on the developing texts of the interviews \nalso allowed us to interrogate the authenticity of the participants\u2019 voice. None the \nless, there remains the possibility that participants may not have been who they \nclaimed to have been in the email conversations. The only evidence we had to \nassuage our fears on this came from our prior knowledge of our participants in other \nprofessional contexts. \n \nAlthough, then, we are convinced of the authenticity of the voices we heard from our \nparticipants, like Kendal (1999) we would contest the claim that email democratises \nresearch conversations \u2013 it might shift the balance of power between researcher and \nresearched to some extent, but researchers cannot escape from the power they exert \nfrom structuring the rules of the process. Nevertheless, email as a medium does hand \nsome levers of control for engaging in the research process to participants. For \nexample, the lack of an embodied social presence of the researcher in the \nconversations makes it easier for participants to ignore researchers\u2019 requests. It lends \nsupport to Giddens (1984) theory of structuration that power is exerted by influential \n 22 \npeople not only through control of systems and resources but also through control of \nthe rules for engaging with systems and resources.  \n \nThe quality of interpersonal relationships was crucial in these studies, as it is in any \nqualitative research. Whilst recognising our presence as on-line researchers, we found \nthis never compromised our participants\u2019 willingness to participate in our studies. As \nalready indicated, in our studies we knew the participants beforehand as fellow \nprofessionals, allowing us to build on pre-existing relationships of trust and develop \nopen and honest dialogue. However the medium of email hides most conventional \nsocial signal systems and seems to weigh the balance of power in email exchanges \nstrongly towards the originator, in this case the researcher. So participants\u2019 responses \nmay be cursory, disclosing as little of themselves as they think reasonable within the \nframework of what they have agreed to in an uncertain environment, as they tend to \nbe with telephone interviews (Arksey and Knight 1999). It forces researchers to think \nvery carefully about how they build relationships of trust with participants they cannot \nsee and may never meet. It raises questions, and prompts us to undertake further \nresearch to explore how participants who do not have prior knowledge of the \nresearchers would react if invited to partake in similar web-based qualitative research \nprojects. Problematic, then, is the extent to which it is possible to build collaborative \nconversations and trust, allowing participants to feel able to explore topics in depth, \nwhen many of the normal social signal systems are absent from the conversations.  \n \nEstablishing the credibility of these studies was achieved through adapting \nconventional approaches to qualitative research to the particular features of email as a \nmedium of communication. This raised particular concerns about conducting the \n 23 \nstudies in an ethical manner because of the capacity of email to make participants \nvisible. It also posed problems for ensuring that records of conversations were \nproperly preserved and in such a state as participants would be able to comment on \nthe accuracy with which they reflected their views. This latter was resolved by \nconstructing rubrics to guide researchers and participants in the manner of collecting \nand safeguarding exchanges. Despite the dilemmas faced by us as researchers with \nthis medium of email based qualitative research, we concur with Sturges and \nHanrahan (2004) that \u2018\u2026advances in technology shape the way we do research, and \nresearchers need to consider how the technology fits in the lives of potential \nparticipants\u2019 (p.116). In particular, we are encouraged to continue to explore its \npotential especially for more reflective in-depth interviewing such as might be used in \nlife history methods. It has most to offer as a medium when face-to-face contact \nbetween researchers and participants is either unnecessary or impractical, and when \nsnappy responses to research questions are not required.  \n \n  \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAnderson, T. and Anuka, H.

These difficulties seem to be compounded when the students are \nalready experienced practitioners in their field, are part-timers, and have English as \ntheir second or third language. When the part-time students are based outside the UK \nand not in other institutions of Higher Education, then the problems of constructing a \nsuitable work-related identity for pursuing doctoral studies in an English university \nseem very great. \n \nThis study seeks to explore how students construct their academic work-related \nidentities and how their understandings of English for academic purposes, of the \ncultures of English universities and other universities, and of their own selves and \nfuture selves shape those. \n \nUsing email interviews for research is a relatively unknown field, so I am interested \nto explore it. \n \n\uf0b7 As I cannot come easily to interview you and talk about the problem outlined \nabove, I am trying to gather the data by email interview. \n \n\uf0b7 If you are willing to be part of this study, please reply to this email straight \naway, confirming the appropriate confidential email address for this research. \n 35 \n \n\uf0b7 Discussion with you will be in the strictest confidence and participants\u2019 names \nwill not be revealed in any documents or papers developed from this research, \nor to any other participants in this research. \n \n\uf0b7 You will be asked nine substantive questions, as well as a few biographical \nones at the beginning, and a question evaluating this email research process at \nthe end. \n \n\uf0b7 The substantive questions will be sent to you one at a time for you to comment \non and respond to. Each question may be followed up by supplementary \nquestions. This process simulates a face-to-face semi-structured interview \n \n\uf0b7 Please answer on top of the message and question sent to you (not at the \nbottom of it!). This is to sustain the sequence of question and answer in our \ndiscussion, without both of us having to scroll through screeds of earlier \ndialogue \u2013 although you are welcome to make reference to our earlier \ndialogue in you answers to current questions. \n \n\uf0b7 Please do not delete any part of the email dialogue as it develops \u2013 it is your \n(and my!) record of our conversation \n \n\uf0b7 Please reply to each communication within three days.  \n \n 36 \n\uf0b7 Our whole email discussion is expected to be completed within three weeks \n \n\uf0b7 Many thanks for your help and time with this (pilot) project      \n    \n \nSource: Busher, H.

Please read the following guidelines and if you are still happy to \ntake part in the interview, please reply to this email and I shall send you the first \nquestion. The email interviews will consider the issues that arose in the questionnaire \nin more depth. The data gathered through the email interviews will provide a \ntranscript of your account. These accounts will be used to inform the research study. \n \nIn undertaking the email interview please note the following guidelines: \n \ni) If you are still willing to take part in this study, please reply to this email straight \naway. \n \nii) The interviews will be conducted in strictest confidence and your anonymity will \nbe assured throughout the research project. \n \niii) You will be asked eleven substantive questions.  \n \niv) These questions will be sent to you one at a time. Please respond to the question \nby email. Each question may be followed up by supplementary questions.  \n 38 \n \n v) It is anticipated that an ongoing dialogue will occur. In order to achieve this, \nplease ensure that you answer on top of the message and question sent to you. \nPLEASE DO NOT ANSWER AT THE BOTTOM OF IT. This will ensure the \nsequence of questions and answers is not broken.  \n \nvi) Please do not delete any part of the email dialogue. This will be our record of the \nconversation.   \n \nvii) Please reply to each email question within three working days if possible. I will \nalso try to reply to your response within that timescale. \n \nviii) It is anticipated that the email dialogue will be completed within ten weeks. \n \nix) Once the dialogue is complete you will be asked to authenticate your account. \n \nx) The completed dialogue may be followed up by further email discussion. \n \nSource: James, N.
