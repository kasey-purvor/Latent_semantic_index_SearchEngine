However,\nevidence of a beneficial effect in observational studies\ndoes not provide convincing evidence. For example,\nthe protective effect of \u00e2 carotene in coronary heart\ndisease was strongly supported by observational\nevidence, but large randomised controlled trials\nshowed no protective effects on morbidity or\nmortality.8\nPrevious investigators have extrapolated the reduc\u203a\ntion in coronary heart disease that might be expected\nfrom changes in blood cholesterol concentration,4 7\neven though there is direct evidence from randomised\ncontrolled trials of the effect of modification or reduc\u203a\ntion of intake of dietary fats. We therefore performed a\nsystematic review to assess the effect of change in\ndietary fat intake, which would be expected to result in\na lowering of cholesterol concentration, on mortality\nand cardiovascular morbidity, using all available\nrandomised clinical trials. The interventions included\nany of the following: reduction in intake of total fat;\nreduction in intake of saturated fat; reduction in intake\nof dietary cholesterol; or a shift from saturated to\nunsaturated fat.\nMethods\nMuch of the methodology has been reported\npreviously.9 Briefly, we developed a search strategy to\nsearch for nutrition based randomised controlled trials\non the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CAB\nabstracts, CVRCT registry (inception of database to\nmid\u203a1998), and SIGLE (January 1999). We searched\nbibliographies and contacted related Cochrane Review\nGroups and 60 experts (May 1999) for further trials.\nThere were no language restrictions.\nThe inclusion criteria were adequate randomisa\u203a\ntion; usual or control diet or placebo group; stated aim\nof intervention was reduction or modification of intake\nof dietary fat or cholesterol, unless the intervention was\nexclusively omega 3 fatty acids; intervention was not\nmultifactorial; the intervention group were not\nchildren, acutely ill, or pregnant; the intervention (diet\nprovided or supplementation) continued for at least six\nmonths or follow up (after dietary advice) was at least\nsix months; and data on mortality or cardiovascular\nmorbidity were available.\nOur primary outcomes of interest were effects of\nintervention on total mortality, cardiovascular mor\u203a\ntality, combined cardiovascular events (including all\navailable data on cardiovascular deaths, non\u203afatal myo\u203a\ncardial infarction, stroke, angina, heart failure, periph\u203a\neral vascular disease, angioplasty, and coronary artery\nbypass grafting), and quality of life. Event data were\nincluded only when they occurred during provision of\ndiet or supplement (when these were provided) or\nA table giving\ndetails of included\nstudies is available\non the BMJ\u2019s\nwebsite\nManchester Dental\nand Education\nCentre (MANDEC),\nUniversity Dental\nHospital of\nManchester,\nManchester\nM15 6FH\nLee Hooper\nresearch associate in\nevidence based care\nand systematic review\nSchool of Health,\nUniversity of\nTeesside,\nMiddlesbrough,\nCleveland TS1 3BA\nCarolyn D\nSummerbell\nreader in human\nnutrition\nSystematic Reviews\nTraining Unit,\nInstitute of Child\nHealth, London\nWC1N 1EH\nJulian P T Higgins\nstatistician\nPublic Health\nNutrition, Institute\nof Human\nNutrition, Level B,\nSouth Academic\nBlock,\nSouthampton\nGeneral Hospital,\nSouthampton\nSO16 6YD\nRachel L\nThompson\nsenior research fellow\nin public health\nnutrition\ncontinued over\nBMJ 2001;322:757\u201363\n757BMJ VOLUME 322 31 MARCH 2001 bmj.com\nwhile randomisation and blinding were maintained (in\ndietary advice trials).\nInclusion was assessed independently by two asses\u203a\nsors (LH, RLT) and differences were resolved by\ndiscussion, with, if necessary, a third reviewer (RAR).\nData extracted independently in duplicate (by LH and\nRLT) included type of participants, interventions, and\noutcomes; characteristics of trial quality; numbers of\nevents; total patient years in trial; and data on potential\neffect modifiers. Effect modifiers included participants\u2019\nbaseline risk of cardiovascular disease, trial duration,\nmode of intervention, change in intake of dietary fats,\nand serum cholesterol concentration achieved.\nCriteria for assessment of trial quality included\nmethod of randomisation, physician blinding, partici\u203a\npant blinding, and any systematic difference in care\nbetween the intervention groups.\nWe used meta\u203aanalysis to explore the primary\nhypothesis, which was that reduction or modification of\ndietary fat intake affects mortality, cardiovascular mor\u203a\ntality, and cardiovascular events. We examined the\neffects of duration of intervention, initial level of\ncardiovascular risk and dietary fat intake, type of inter\u203a\nvention, and changes in intake of total, saturated,\nmonounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats and blood\ncholesterol concentration using subgrouping of trials\nand meta\u203aregression. We excluded trials that aimed to\nalter omega 3 intake as the method of action (if any) is\nprobably different from any action caused by the\nreduction in intake of total or saturated fat\u2014that is,\nit does not primarily lower low density lipoprotein\ncholesterol.\nTreatment effect was measured as a rate ratio and\nmeta\u203aanalysis performed as a weighted average of log\nrate ratios.10 The meta\u203aanalysis used random effects\nmethodology11 within S\u203aPLUS.12 Meta\u203aanalysis pools\nresults of individual trials, with weighting so that results\nwith higher precision (related to sample size)\ncontribute more to the combined outcome. We used\nthe STATA command metareg13 for random effects\nmeta\u203aregression.14 Meta\u203aregression investigates the\neffect of one or more study characteristics on the size\nof treatment effect, taking precision into account. A\ngenuine relation may be inferred (for example, if the\nextent of reduction in total fat achieved by the\nintervention is associated with the degree of reduction\nin mortality) when a slope is significantly different from\nzero. We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect any bias\nin the trials retrieved.15\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nWe identified 27 studies, comprising 40 distinct\nintervention arms over 30 902 person years of\nobservation.16\u201342 A table with details of all 27 studies can\nbe found on the BMJ \u2019s website. Figure 1 gives a flow\nchart of studies assessed and excluded at various stages\nof the review. Table 1 gives details of extracted data. We\nfound almost no data on quality of life or levels of trans\nfats. The \u00ea statistic for inter\u203arater agreement on\ninclusion or exclusion of potential trials was 0.61.43\nReduction or modification of dietary fat intake\nThe pooled rate ratio for total mortality was 0.98 (95%\nconfidence interval 0.86 to 1.12), which indicates little,\nif any, effect (fig 2). The data on cardiovascular\nmortality indicate a slight (9%) protection from modi\u203a\nfication of intake of dietary fat (0.91; 0.77 to 1.07) (fig 3)\nand a 16% reduction in cardiovascular events (0.84;\n0.72 to 0.99) (fig 4). A funnel plot of effect size versus\nsample size did not show any evidence of bias (data not\nshown).\nThe Oslo diet\u203aheart trial provided some oily fish (a\nsource of omega 3 fatty acids) to participants in the\nintervention group.33 Exclusion of the results of this\ntrial attenuated the rate ratios for all three main\noutcomes (total mortality 1.02 (0.91 to 1.14); cardio\u203a\nvascular mortality 0.94 (0.79 to 1.11); combined\ncardiovascular events 0.86 (0.72 to 1.03)).\nFigure 5 shows the results of the meta\u203aanalyses,\nsubgroupings, and sensitivity analyses performed.\nTable 2 shows the results of the meta\u203aregressions.\nDuration of follow up, initial level of cardiovascular\nrisk, type of intervention, and dietary fat intake at\nbaseline\nWe obtained results for specific length of time on diet,\ninitial level of cardiovascular risk, or mode of interven\u203a\ntion through subgrouping of trials.

When we\nexcluded data from the Oslo diet\u203aheart study, the rate\nratio for combined cardiovascular events for trials with\nmean follow up longer than two years was not altered\n(0.77; 0.62 to 0.96).

Neither the\nmethod of dietary modification (by diet advice, advice\nplus a supplement, or diet provided) nor the initial\nlevel of intake of dietary fat influenced rate ratios.\nChanges in fat intake and blood cholesterol\nconcentration\nWe used meta\u203aregression to explore the effects on total\nmortality and combined cardiovascular events of chang\u203a\ning the proportion of energy from total fat and of alter\u203a\ning serum cholesterol concentrations.

However, none of these relations were\nconvincing (none of the slopes were different from zero\nat a P < 0.05, see table 2), except for that of monounsatu\u203a\nrated fat. Here the slope depended heavily on one\nmedium sized trial, St Thomas\u2019s atherosclerosis\nregression study (STARS),37 and should therefore be\ntreated with caution.\nDiscussion\nPooled results of dietary fat trials indicate that\nreduction or modification of intake of dietary fat\nreduces the incidence of combined cardiovascular\nevents by 16% (rate ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval\n0.72 to 0.99) and cardiovascular deaths by 9% (0.91;\n0.77 to 1.07). No effect was seen on total mortality.\nExclusion of data from the Oslo diet study33 attenu\u203a\nated the effects on cardiovascular events. In this trial\nparticipants in the intervention group were supplied\nwith oily fish, in addition to dietary advice. Oily fish,\nwhich is rich in omega 3 fatty acids, seems to have\nindependent beneficial effects,44 so the benefits seen in\nthis trial may have been due to the fish oils and not to\ncholesterol lowering or alterations in other dietary fats.\nDuration of trial effect\nSubgrouping by length of mean follow up suggests\nthat virtually all protection from cardiovascular events\noccurs in trials of at least two years\u2019 duration. In trials\nwith mean follow up of two years or less the reduction\nin events was only 4%, whereas in trials with longer fol\u203a\nlow up reductions of up to 24% were seen. This effect\nwas confirmed in a meta\u203aregression.\nThe division at two years was chosen after we stud\u203a\nied initial data from the Scandinavian simvastatin sur\u203a\nvival study (4S), which assessed the effect of simvastatin\non mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarc\u203a\ntion.45 In that study little difference in event rates\nbetween treated and control groups emerged until\nafter two years. The similar time lag between the effects\nof dietary intervention and statins suggests a common\nmechanism, perhaps through effects on the scale, type,\nand stability of atherosclerotic plaques (rather than\nrapid alteration in blood coagulability), but other\nmechanisms may also be operating.\nIt is not clear whether it is the duration of the inter\u203a\nvention or the duration of the follow up that\ndetermines whether the intervention is effective.\nSustained change in dietary behaviour, promoted by\nlong interventions, is probably necessary to achieve\nreduction in cardiovascular events, and lengthy follow\nup is probably required before pathophysiological\nchanges that reduce clinical events are observed.\nInitial level of cardiovascular risk\nSubgrouping suggested no effect of initial level of risk\non outcomes. Both high and low risk groups had a\nsimilar level of risk reduction for combined cardiovas\u203a\ncular events. This is in contrast to results of previous\nstudies,46 though initial levels of risk in studies in this\nsystematic review were generally high (people in\ncontrol group at \u201clow risk\u201d of cardiovascular events suf\u203a\nfered 2.57 events per 100 people per year and those at\n\u201chigh risk\u201d 7.62 events per 100 people per year).\nMost of the events in this review occurred in men.\nOnly two trials with events included women29 42 so it\nmay not be appropriate to generalise these results to\nwomen.\nType of intervention\nSubgrouping by mode of intervention showed no ben\u203a\nefit of providing the entire diet compared with dietary\nadvice or advice and a supplement. This was surprising\nas we expected that provision of food would have a\nmore powerful effect on events than dietary advice\nalone.\nChanges in blood cholesterol concentration\nMeta\u203aregression provided weak evidence that a greater\nreduction in serum cholesterol concentrations in the\nintervention group compared with the control group\nresulted in a slightly greater reduction in cardiovas\u203a\ncular events and mortality.\nA reduction of over 20% in total serum cholesterol\nconcentration can result in a 25% fall in mortality from\ncoronary heart disease.47 Within dietary trials in this\nreview the mean initial serum cholesterol concentra\u203a\ntion was 5.8 mmol\/l, with a fall of 0.64 mmol\/l (11%).\nThis degree of reduction is similar to that achieved by\nDART17\nLondon corn and olive (corn)25\nLondon corn and olive (olive)25\nLondon low fat26\nMinnesota coronary survey29\nMRC soya trial30\nOslo diet-heart study33\nSTARS37\nSydney diet-heart study38\nVeterans admin centre trial41\nVeterans diet and skin cancer42\nPooled \n0.1 1.0\nRate ratio\nControl betterIntervention better\n10.0\n0.98 (0.86 to 1.12)\nFig 2 Estimates of total mortality (95% confidence intervals) from\nmeta\u203aanalysis\nDART17\nLondon corn and olive (corn)25\nLondon corn and olive (olive)25\nLondon low fat26\nMinnesota coronary survey29\nMRC soya trial30\nOslo diet-heart study33\nSTARS37\nVeterans admin centre trial41\nVeterans diet and skin cancer42\nPooled \n0.1 1.0\nRate ratio\nControl betterIntervention better\n10.0\n0.91 (0.77 to 1.07)\nFig 3 Estimates of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence\nintervals) from meta\u203aanalysis\nPapers\n760 BMJ VOLUME 322 31 MARCH 2001 bmj.com\nearly fibrates, which show reductions in rates of coron\u203a\nary heart disease only among those at high risk.46 How\u203a\never, early fibrates seemed to increase mortality from\nother causes, and hence any benefit from this reduction\nin cholesterol concentration was outweighed by\nadverse effects of the drugs themselves. In dietary\nmodification this degree of cholesterol lowering is\nprobably of modest overall benefit.\nMethodology of the review\nIn this review we aimed to find trials that modified or\nreduced dietary fat intake for at least six months, even\nwhen mortality and morbidity were not reported. We\ntried to contact trial authors to ascertain whether it was\nknown if any deaths or cardiovascular events had\noccurred. For this reason, many of the included trials\nare small but are included in the hope of augmenting\nthe data from larger trials and reducing bias. Although\nsmall trials cannot individually hope to achieve useful\ndata on rare events, in meta\u203aanalysis we are increasing\nthe power of the group of studies by pooling.\nWe included factorial trials (for example, the diet\nand reinfarction trial (DART)17) when it was possible to\nseparate out the data on the effect of change in dietary\nfat from the other interventions (which are randomly\ndistributed across the fat control and intervention\ngroups). We excluded multiple risk factor intervention\ntrials as it is not possible to disaggregate the effects of\nchange in dietary fat intake from other, potentially\neffective interventions such as increasing exercise,\nstopping smoking, and change in other dietary\nconstituents. There is already a systematic review on\nthis topic.48 We excluded the Lyon heart study49 as\ninclusion in our review was decided by the stated\nintention of the trial.49 This trial nowhere states the\nintention to reduce or modify dietary fat intake and the\nmajor effect on diet was to increase the omega 3 fat\nintake. We excluded the Finnish mental hospital study50\nas it was not a truly randomised design (a cluster\nrandomised trial with only two clusters).\nAlthough we amassed 30 902 person years of\nobservation, 1430 deaths, and 1216 cardiovascular\nevents, considerable uncertainty exists over the size of\neffects and the means by which they were achieved\ngiven the scarcity of trials longer than two years\u2019 dura\u203a\ntion. It is unlikely that further resources will now be\nforthcoming to perform a large trial of dietary modifi\u203a\ncation. Consequently the evidence pooled in this\nreview contributes all that is available to guide clinical\npractice and health policy on dietary manipulation.\nHowever, publication of data on deaths or cardio\u203a\nvascular events in the large ongoing trials of dietary fat\nlowering with cancer end points would augment\ncurrently available data.\nConclusions\nIn this review we have tried to separate out whether\nchanges in individual fatty acid fractions are responsi\u203a\nble for any benefits to health (using the technique of\nmeta\u203aregression). The answers are not definitive, the\ndata being too sparse to be convincing.

The\nparticipants in most studies were community\nvolunteers, and diagnosis was determined by their\nscore on the Beck depression inventory. When\ncompared with no treatment, exercise reduced\nsymptoms of depression (standardised mean\ndifference in effect size \u20131.1 (95% confidence interval\n\u20131.5 to \u20130.6); weighted mean difference in Beck\ndepression inventory \u20137.3 (\u201310.0 to \u20134.6)). The effect\nsize was significantly greater in those trials with\nshorter follow up and in two trials reported only as\nconference abstracts. The effect of exercise was similar\nto that of cognitive therapy (standardised mean\ndifference \u20130.3 (95% confidence interval \u20130.7 to 0.1)).\nConclusions The effectiveness of exercise in reducing\nsymptoms of depression cannot be determined\nbecause of a lack of good quality research on clinical\npopulations with adequate follow up.\nIntroduction\nDepression is a common and important cause of mor\u203a\nbidity and mortality worldwide. The effect of exercise\non depression has been the subject of research for sev\u203a\neral decades, and the literature on the subject is grow\u203a\ning.1 In the past decade \u201cexercise on prescription\u201d\nschemes have become popular in primary care in the\nUnited Kingdom,2 many of which include depression\nas a referral criterion.\nSeveral plausible mechanisms for how exercise\naffects depression have been proposed. In the\ndeveloped world taking regular exercise is seen as a\nvirtue; the depressed patient who takes regular exercise\nmay, as a result, get positive feedback from other\npeople and an increased sense of self worth. Exercise\nmay act as a diversion from negative thoughts, and the\nmastery of a new skill may be important.3 4 Social con\u203a\ntact may be an important mechanism, and physical\nactivity may have physiological effects such as changes\nin endorphin and monoamine concentrations.5 6\nThis review summarises the evidence from\nrandomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of\nexercise as a treatment for depression.\nMethods\nIdentification of the studies\nWe searched Medline (1966\u203a99), Embase (1980\u203a99),\nSports Discus (1975\u203a99), PsycLIT (1981\u203a99), the\nCochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the\nterms \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201cphysical activity,\u201d \u201cphysical fitness,\u201d\n\u201cwalking,\u201d \u201cjogging,\u201d \u201crunning,\u201d \u201ccycling,\u201d \u201cswimming,\u201d\n\u201cdepression,\u201d \u201cdepressive disorder,\u201d and \u201cdysthymia.\u201d\nWe also examined bibliographies, contacted experts,\nand hand searched copies published in the 12 months\nto December 1999 of selected journals (for details see\nthe longer version of this paper on the BMJ \u2019s website).\nThe full version of\nthis paper appears\non the BMJ\u2019s\nwebsite.
