Magnetospheric physics (Magnetosphere-\nionosphere interactions; Magnetospheric configuration and\ndynamics; Magnetotail boundary layers)\n1 Introduction\nThere are currently two main categories of substorm onset\nmodel which have been developed. The first of these is the\nnear-Earth neutral line model (NENL; Baker et al., 1996, and\nreferences therein). A modified NENL model has also been\nproposed by Shiokawa et al. (1998). The cross-field current\ninstability model (CCI) proposed by Lui (1996), and refer-\nences therein, is the second main category of substorm onset\nmodel. Each encompasses three phases: the growth phase,\nthe expansion phase, and the recovery phase. The NENL\nmodel suggests the spontaneous reconnection of antiparallel\nmagnetic field lines at around 20 to 30RE from Earth in the\nmagnetotail (Nagai et al., 1998), as a result of the magnetotail\nloading that occurs due to dayside reconnection during the\ngrowth phase of the substorm. Closed magnetic field lines\nof the plasma sheet are reconnected first and then followed\nby the open field lines of the tail lobes. Newly-closed field\nlines are returned to the dayside, while tailward of the recon-\nnection site field lines remain connected to the interplanetary\n3668 N.

The reconnection of field lines in this\nregion decreases the current in the central plasma sheet, dis-\nturbing the current flow. Excess current is therefore diverted\naway from the inner current sheet region and redirected into\nthe substorm current wedge (SCW; McPherron et al., 1973).\nThe SCW consists of field-aligned currents directed both into\nand out of the ionosphere, which are closed in the ionosphere\nby a westward auroral electrojet and in the tail by a dawn-\nward directed current. The modified NENL model involves\nbraking of high-speed, Earthward ion flow in the region of\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field that is more dipolar than further\ndowntail. This ion flow is diverted, producing a dawnward\ninertia current at the boundary between dipolar and tail-like\nfields. As flux pile-up continues, this boundary moves tail-\nwards; in the modified NENL model, it is at this boundary\nthat the SCW is formed.\nA consequence of the formation of a NENL together with\nthe distant neutral line is the formation of a region of entirely\nclosed magnetic flux, or plasmoid. At distances greater than\n\u223c30RE downtail plasmoid-type flux ropes from 10RE long\nhave been detected travelling mostly tailward as found in\nISEE and Geotail studies (Ieda et al., 1998). Between 20 and\n30RE downtail smaller flux ropes of 1 to 5RE in diameter\nhave been detected travelling both Earthward and tailward\nin equal numbers by Geotail (Slavin et al., 2003). Travel-\nling compression regions (TCRs) are intensifications of the\nlobe magnetic field caused by the movement of plasmoids\nwithin the magnetotail. The presence of the plasmoid forces\nthe lobe magnetic field lines to compress around it, and these\ncompressions appear to move as the plasmoid moves through\nthe tail. TCRs can be detected as perturbations in the north-\nsouth component of the magnetic field, usually bipolar in na-\nture, reflecting the motion of the plasmoid, and by simulta-\nneous enhancements in the intensity of the tail field magni-\ntude. They are typically detected for a few minutes at a time,\nand both Earthward and tailward-moving TCRs have been\nobserved; Slavin et al. (2005) showed that 20% of TCRs de-\ntected by Cluster within 20RE of Earth were tailward di-\nrected whilst the rest were Earthward directed.\nThe CCI model suggests that current disruption in the\nnear-Earth current sheet at the start of the expansion phase\nof the substorm is caused by the onset of an instability and a\nhigh level of magnetic field fluctuations. The SCW is formed\nand diverts current into, and back out of, the ionosphere,\nand the NENL is formed further downtail (at around 20\nto 30RE) as a result. This then allows reconnection of\nmagnetic field lines in the magnetotail.\nN. Draper et al.: Cluster magnetotail observations of a tailward-travelling plasmoid 3669\nField-aligned currents (FACs; Potemra, 1979; Stern, 1983)\nconsist of two coupled systems: the Region 1 currents,\nwhich flow into the ionosphere from the magnetotail in the\npost-midnight sector, and out of the ionosphere in the pre-\nmidnight sector; and the Region 2 currents, which are oppo-\nsitely directed and occur in the ionosphere at lower latitudes.\nThe Region 1 currents are located along the outer edge of the\nplasma sheet, while the Region 2 currents are located well\nwithin the plasma sheet. These currents couple the magneto-\nsphere to the ionosphere and are a consequence of drag im-\nposed on ionospheric plasma particles, colliding with neutral\nparticles, as the magnetic field lines with which they are as-\nsociated are pulled over the polar caps (Cowley, 2000). The\neastward and westward electrojets meet in the Harang dis-\ncontinuity region, where the Region 1 and 2 currents become\nhard to distinguish.\nHence, in the NENL model substorm onset is initiated by\nspontaneous reconnection of magnetic field lines at around\n20 to 30RE downtail, while in the CCI model it is the current\ndisruption closer to Earth that is the initiator of substorm on-\nset. In this paper we examine observations from a large num-\nber of instruments collecting data in the solar wind, magneto-\nsphere and ionosphere in order to determine the development\nof a substorm on a large scale. We pay special emphasis on\nthe observations in the tail by Cluster relating the currents\nmeasured there to the overall substorm cycle.\n2 Instruments\nData from various instruments on the four Cluster space-\ncraft were used in this study. The Fluxgate Magnetome-\nter (FGM; Balogh et al., 1997) provided information about\nthe magnetic field, while the Cluster Ion Experiment (CIS;\nRe`me et al., 1997) and Plasma Electron and Current Experi-\nment (PEACE; Johnstone et al., 1997) instruments provided\ninformation about the low energy ions (0.02 eV to 30 keV)\nand electrons (0.7 eV to 30 keV), respectively. The Research\nwith Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors (RAPID; Wilken\net al., 1997) instrument provided high energy electron (40 to\n400 keV) data from the Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES)\ninstrument. At the time of interest the Cluster spacecraft\nwere located at around 15RE downtail, 8RE from midnight\nin the pre-midnight sector and around 2RE above the equa-\ntorial plane at a separation of \u223c1RE ; Cluster 1 was located\nclosest to midnight, Cluster 2 furthest from midnight, Clus-\nter 3 closest to the equatorial plane, and Cluster 4 was located\nfarthest downtail. Figure 1 presents the position of the mag-\nnetic footprint of the Cluster 1 spacecraft on 5 October 2002\nbetween 00:00 and 06:00 UT (orange line) mapped using the\nTsyganenko 1996 model (Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996).\nSupporting data are available from a number of other\nsources. The solar wind conditions for this event were de-\ntected using the magnetometer instrument (MAG; Smith et\nal., 1998) and Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Moni-\ntor instrument (SWEPAM; McComas et al., 1998) on the\nAdvanced Composition Explorer spacecraft (ACE; Stone et\nal., 1998). The near-Earth (6.6RE) downtail conditions were\ninvestigated for this event using magnetic field data from a\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-\n8) spacecraft (Nagai et al., 1982) and energetic proton and\nelectron flux data from a Los Alamos National Laboratory\n(LANL-01A) spacecraft (Belian et al., 1978).\nData from two ground-based magnetometer chains were\nalso used in this study: the Canadian Auroral Network for\nthe Open Program Unified Study (CANOPUS; Rostoker et\nal., 1995) and the Greenland magnetometer network (Friis-\nChristensen et al., 1985). The CANOPUS magnetometers\nare located in west-central Canada (green crosses on Fig. 1),\nwhile the Greenland magnetometers are located along the\neastern and western coasts of Greenland (red crosses on\nFig. 1). Magnetometer stations of particular interest are la-\nbelled. Unfortunately, data from other magnetometer sites\nlocated between CANOPUS and Greenland were not avail-\nable to provide more comprehensive coverage of this region\nof the ionosphere, as they were either located at too high a\nlatitude to detect the substorm onset, or had no data available\nfor this interval.\nGround-based data were also used from six of the\nNorthern Hemisphere HF radars (Kodiak, Prince George,\nPykkvib\u00e6r, Hankasalmi, Saskatoon, Stokkseyri; depicted in\nblue in Fig. 1) of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN; Greenwald et al., 1995) radar array. These\nline-of-sight velocity data were used to obtain ionospheric\nflows.\n3 Data description\n3.1 Ground magnetometer data, SuperDARN radar data,\nand IMF conditions\nFigure 2 shows data from two selected CANOPUS mag-\nnetometer stations, Island Lake (ISL, 64.74\u25e6 invariant lati-\ntude; 21:00 MLT at 03:30 UT) and Pinawa (PIN, 60.98\u25e6;\n21:00 MLT at 03:30 UT), and from the Narsasuaq (NAQ,\n66.31\u25e6; 01:30 MLT at 03:30 UT) Greenland station for 5 Oc-\ntober 2002, from 02:30 to 04:30 UT. Shown are the X and\nZ components of the magnetic field at each station, and the\nX and Z components filtered between 20 and 200 s, providing\ninformation on the presence of Pi2 wave activity. The filtered\nX component of the magnetic field first detected Pi2 waves\nat 02:50 UT, and this time is taken as that of substorm expan-\nsion phase onset in the absence of optical data for this event.\nAt 02:52 UT a decrease in the X component at the ISL sta-\ntion and a positive increase in the X component at PIN were\ndetected. The PIN station also detected a decrease in the Z\ncomponent of the magnetic field at this time, whilst ISL de-\ntected a gradually decreasing Z component. Given that both\nISL and PIN were located at the same local time we conclude\nthat ISL detected a westward electrojet, and was equatorward\nof the centre, whilst PIN detected the edge of the eastward\nelectrojet. The NAQ station detected Pi2 pulsations from\n02:52 UT. The X component of the magnetic field decreased\n3670 N.

Substorm onset at 02:50 UT is indicated by the vertical dashed line.\nfrom 02:53 UT, indicating detection of the westward elec-\ntrojet. At onset, the Z component of the magnetic field was\nnegative, increasing and turning positive around 8 min after\nonset. This indicates that the centre of the westward elec-\ntrojet was located poleward of the NAQ station at onset, and\nequatorward of the NAQ station from 8 min after onset.\nLine-of-sight velocity measurements from six of the Su-\nperDARN radar array (Kodiak, Prince George, Pykkvib\u00e6r,\nHankasalmi, Saskatoon and Stokkseyri) were available for\nthis interval. They were combined using the map potential\nanalysis technique (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998) to produce\nlarge-scale global convection maps at two-minute intervals\nN.

At substorm onset, no strong\nflows were detected in the pre-midnight sector (see Fig. 3a).\nHowever, intensification of ionospheric flow occurred in the\nmidnight sector to \u223c800 ms\u22121 from 03:14 UT (24 min after\nonset; Fig. 3b), and to \u223c1000 ms\u22121 from 03:20 UT (30 min\nafter onset; Fig. 3c).\nThe IMF conditions for this event are shown in Fig. 4.\nThese are data from the MAG and SWEPAM instruments\non the ACE spacecraft for 5 October 2002, from 01:30 to\n03:30 UT. They are lagged by 66 min to take into account the\ntime between the solar wind being detected at the spacecraft\nand it reaching the Earth\u2019s magnetopause. This lag is found\nusing the technique of Khan and Cowley (1999). The IMF\nconditions around onset time were generally steady, with Bz\nnegative for around 45 min prior to onset (apart from a small\nnorthward excursion around 15 min prior to onset). After on-\nset the IMF conditions remained steady with Bz negative.\nThe solar wind velocity was \u223c400 kms\u22121 for the interval,\nand the dynamic pressure underwent a graduated increase\nfrom \u223c0.9 nPa to \u223c1.1 nPa over \u223c40 min. It is worth not-\ning that the data show no evidence for substorm triggering.\n3.2 Near-Earth instruments\nFigure 5 shows magnetometer data from the GOES 8 space-\ncraft for 5 October 2002, from 02:30 to 04:30 UT. In GSM,\nthis spacecraft was located 5.5RE downtail, 3.4RE from\nmidnight in the pre-midnight sector and within 0.5RE of\nthe GSM equatorial plane in the 22:00 MLT sector. The\nsatellite is located north of the magnetic equator. A slight\nincrease in the latitude angle of the field, \u03bb (where tan\n\u03bb=Bz\/\n\u221a(B2x+B2y )), is observed at 02:50 UT and is followed\nby a stronger increase at 02:56 UT, indicating dipolarization\nof the magnetic field at 6.6RE downtail. This is the signa-\nture of expansion phase onset at this location in the magne-\ntosphere.\nParticle data from the Synchronous Orbit Particle Ana-\nlyzer instruments (SOPA; Belian et al., 1992) on the LANL-\n01A (located in 04:00 MLT sector at 03:00 UT), \u201302A\n(08:00 MLT at 03:00 UT), \u201397A (10:00 MLT at 03:00 UT)\nand 1991-080 (16:00 MLT at 03:00 UT) spacecraft are shown\nin Figs. 6 (50\u2013315 keV electrons) and 7 (50\u2013400 keV pro-\ntons) for 5 October 2002, from 00:00 to 06:00 UT. The space-\ncraft located closest to the magnetotail at substorm expansion\nphase onset is therefore LANL-01A. The electron data show\na plasma injection at this spacecraft at 02:51 UT, with dis-\npersed injections resulting from this event detected at other\nspacecraft at later times, most notably at the spacecraft lo-\ncated at 16:00 MLT (1991-080). The proton data show an\nincrease in the dispersed injection at all spacecraft, occurring\nearliest at 02:55 UT at the spacecraft located at 16:00 MLT\n(1991-080).\n3.3 Cluster data overview\n3.3.1 Cluster particle data\nThe ion data from the CIS instrument on Cluster 1, 3 and\n4 are shown in Fig. 8 for 5 October 2002, from 02:30 to\n04:30 UT. Note that the CIS instrument on Cluster 2 was\nnot operational. The plots show the low energy (0.02 eV to\n30 keV) ion density, Vx and Vy velocity components (GSM\ncoordinates) and plasma beta (2\u00b50nkT\u22a5\/B2, calculated from\nCIS and FGM data). Figure 9 shows low energy electron\n(0.7 eV to 30 keV) flux data from the four PEACE instru-\nments, and Fig. 10 shows high energy electron flux data (20\nto 400 keV) from the four RAPID-IES instruments.\nThe CIS instrument detected an ion density of \u223c0.1 cm\u22123\nbefore the substorm expansion phase onset at 02:50 UT,\nindicating that the Cluster spacecraft were located in the\nplasma sheet. The PEACE and RAPID-IES data corrobo-\nrate this: the PEACE instrument detected a differential flux\nof \u223c0.5 counts s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 in the 1 to 10 keV en-\nergy range, while the RAPID-IES instrument detected a dif-\nferential flux of \u223c2.7 counts s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 in the 40-\nto 400-keV range. At 02:57 UT they entered the plasma\nsheet boundary layer, as the density began to decrease and\nfast Earthward-directed beams (composed primarily of pro-\ntons) in the Vx component of velocity were detected by the\nN.

Such beams are the signature of the plasma\nsheet boundary layer (PSBL, e.g. Baumjohann et al., 1988).\nThese beams became tailward-directed from 03:08 UT un-\ntil 03:14 UT, but had plasma characteristics similar to the\nEarthward-directed beams. The PEACE data show that the\nspacecraft did not exit swiftly from the PSBL, but remained\nin it for around 15 min before entering the lobe at 03:14 UT.\nCluster 3, which was located closest to the equatorial plane,\ndetected the smallest decrease in density and the smallest\nplasma beams. This is consistent with Cluster 3 being further\ninto the plasma sheet than the other spacecraft. At 03:30 UT\nthe plasma instruments on the Cluster spacecraft detected\nplasma densities close to those before onset, indicating that\nthey re-entered the plasma sheet at that time. This was ac-\ncompanied by further PSBL beam signatures detected by the\nCIS instrument, directed mainly Earthward.\nThe plasma beta plots for the three spacecraft clearly de-\npict the spacecraft as initially in the plasma sheet, when\nplasma beta is close to 1. Plasma beta decreases at all\nspacecraft at 02:57 UT when the spacecraft enter the PSBL,\n3674 N.

There is another clear transition at\n03:30 UT when the spacecraft re-enter the plasma sheet, with\nplasma beta recovering to \u223c1 at all spacecraft.\n3.3.2 Cluster Magnetic Field Data\nThe Cluster FGM data are shown in panels 1 to 4 of Fig. 11a,\nand in more detail for the 02:40 to 03:10 UT interval in the\ntop four panels of Fig. 11b. Starting 02:51 UT (1 min af-\nter onset), there was a decrease in the x component of the\nmagnetic field from \u223c33 nT to \u223c26 nT over a 4-min period.\nOver this same period, the z component of the magnetic field\nalso decreased, from\u223c0 nT to\u223c\u20136 nT, and then recovered to\n\u223c0 nT.

This current was mainly\ndue to a difference of the x component of the magnetic field\nin the z direction. The spacecraft detected a total magnetic\nfield of \u223c30 nT prior to onset, indicating a change in Bx of\n\u223c60 nT across the plasma sheet inside Cluster. Typically, the\ncurrent sheet thickness would be around 5RE . This implies\na total current of \u223c60 nT \/ (\u00b50\u00d75RE), or \u223c2\u00d710\u22129 Am\u22122.\nThis is of the order of twice the value deduced from the FGM\ndata, and is consistent with a spacecraft location away from\nthe centre of the plasma sheet (where the current density is\nreduced). A few minutes prior to onset this Jy current den-\nsity is lost, but the total magnetic field remains the same,\nindicating that the total current within the plasma sheet has\nremained the same.\nWhen the spacecraft crossed into the plasma sheet bound-\nary layer from the plasma sheet at 02:57 UT, predominantly\nEarthward-directed Jx current densities were detected by\nthe spacecraft to a peak value of \u223c2.3\u00d710\u22129 Am\u22122. At\n03:30 UT, the spacecraft crossed the plasma sheet boundary\nlayer from the lobe back into the plasma sheet, and this time\nmainly tailward-directed Jx current densities were detected,\nto a peak value of \u223c\u20132.7\u00d710\u22129 Am\u22122. Examination of the\nmagnetic field data shows that these currents were associ-\nated mainly with By varying in the z direction, rather than\nBz varying in the y direction.\n4 Discussion\nThe substorm expansion phase onset timing for this substorm\nis taken as 02:50 UT. This is from the earliest Pi2 pulsation\ndetection at the PIN and ISL magnetometer stations of the\nCANOPUS network. It has been deduced that the westward\nelectrojet was located poleward of the ISL station and located\nequatorward of the NAQ Greenland station after onset. Com-\nbining these observations constrains the substorm electrojet\nto the region shown by the shaded area in Fig. 12. This re-\ngion was in the pre-midnight sector during this interval of the\nsubstorm and extended over 4 h of magnetic local time.\nPrior to substorm expansion phase onset the current den-\nsities calculated from the magnetic field measurements at\nthe Cluster spacecraft indicated a value of Jy current around\nhalf the probable average in that region. This small value of\ncross-tail current indicates that the spacecraft were located\naway from the centre of the plasma sheet. Jy then returned\nN.

Cluster RAPID-IES electron energy data for 5 October 2002, from 02:30 to 04:30 UT.\nto\u223czero a few minutes before onset while the total magnetic\nfield remained constant. This is consistent with the rapid\nthinning of the current sheet within the plasma sheet dur-\ning the growth phase of the substorm, leaving the spacecraft\nlocated above this thinned current sheet.\nAt 02:51 UT, 1 min after substorm expansion phase onset,\nthe Cluster spacecraft detected a signature not consistent\nwith substorm expansion phase onset in the magnetic field\ndata prior to exiting the plasma sheet to the plasma sheet\nboundary layer. At onset one would expect to see a classic\ndipolarization signature for a spacecraft located Earthward of\na near-Earth neutral line, with a decrease in the x component\nof magnetic field and increase in the z component. Here\nBx increased very slightly then strongly decreased, and\nBz decreased, becoming strongly negative for 7 min. Bx\nremained reduced when the spacecraft entered the plasma\nsheet boundary layer, but Bz recovered to its original value\nof \u223c1 nT. This signature is consistent with the formation\nof a reconnection site Earthward of the spacecraft, creating\na plasmoid whose centre was tailward of the spacecraft\nwhich then formed a TCR, as illustrated in Fig. 13a. Thus\nonly fields with a negative z component were observed as\n3678 N. Draper et al.: Cluster magnetotail observations of a tailward-travelling plasmoid\n \nFigure 11a \n \n \n 39 \nFig. 11. (a) Cluster FGM data for 5 October 2002, from 02:30 to 04:30 UT. Bx , By , Bz components of the magnetic field (GSM coordinates),\nthe total magnetic field, Jx , Jy , Jz components of the current (also GSM coordinates), div B and plasma beta are shown, with shaded areas\nrepresenting regions of magnetosphere;\nthe TCR formed and then departed tailward. The tailward\nmotion is corroborated by the order in which the spacecraft\ndetected the TCR: the spacecraft farthest downtail, Cluster 4,\ndetected the TCR last. The formation of this plasmoid\nresulting in a TCR under the spacecraft places the spacecraft\ntailward of a near-Earth neutral line, and positive Bx con-\nfirms that the spacecraft were above the plasma sheet centre,\nin the PSBL. Analysis of the timings for the peak in Bx , the\nnegative turning of Bz and the peak in Btotal revealed that\nthe TCR was travelling at \u223c200 kms\u22121. This is around one\nquarter the values described in Slavin et al. (2005), but may\nbe accounted for by the fact that the TCR was still in its\nearly stages of formation. Immediately after the plasmoid\ndeparted downtail and Bz returned to small positive values,\nthe spacecraft all detected a decrease in plasma densities and\na sustained increase in plasma velocities for up to 10 min at\nCluster 4. The Cluster 3 spacecraft, located closest to the\nequatorial plane, detected the weakest beams and smallest\ndecrease in plasma density. This began at 02:57 UT, and\nindicates that the spacecraft entered the PSBL at that time;\ntheir location is illustrated in Fig. 13b. There was therefore\na significant time delay (6 min) between the measurement\nof a negative Bz and the subsequent detection of Earthward\nflows which is accounted for by this scenario. Figure 13c\nillustrates the departure of the plasmoid downtail. From\n03:08 UT the beams were tailward and detected mainly\nby Cluster 1 and 4, indicating that the beams were located\nonly on the outer edge of the plasma sheet and not further\ninto the plasma sheet where the Cluster 3 spacecraft was\nlocated. The tailward beams indicate that the spacecraft\nmay have detected PSBL particles that were mirrored at the\nEarth and returned to the location of the spacecraft during\ntime-dependent behaviour of the plasma sheet, but further\nstudy is required to determine whether this is the case. From\nhere the spacecraft exited to the lobe. At 03:30 UT, the\nspacecraft re-entered the plasma sheet from the lobe, again\ncrossing the PSBL, and detected increased densities and\nhigh-speed Earthward plasma beams. Taguchi et al. (1998)\nN.

A predominantly\ntailward Jx current density was detected upon re-entry to\nthe plasma sheet at 03:30 UT.

This suggests that these\nEarthward- and tailward- directed currents are flowing in a\nsheet at the boundary of the plasma sheet, in the interface\nbetween open and closed field lines. Such sheets of current,\nhaving the sense of \u201cRegion 1\u201d field-aligned currents, have\nbeen observed in substorm simulations (e.g. Birn and Hesse,\n1996), with an explanation which is illustrated in Fig. 14.\nFigure 14a shows the x-y plane of the magnetosphere, with\nopen field lines above the plasma sheet depicted by dashed\nblue lines. The dashed red line in the y direction repre-\nsents the reconnection line which occupies the central part\nof the tail, shown symmetric about midnight for the simplest\ncase. The dashed red lines with arrows depict plasma stream-\nlines away from the reconnection line, representing the paths\nfollowed by the ends of the newly-reconnected closed field\nlines. These imply that a Vy velocity component should be\npresent in the downstream flow, carrying the newly-closed\nfield lines away from the reconnection region in the midnight\nsector towards both dawn and dusk, as required to distribute\nthe newly-reconnected flux broadly through the closed field\nregion. The dawnward and duskward motion causes the re-\nconnected field lines to twist in direction in the plasma sheet\nas shown by the black solid lines, the twist in the North-\nern Hemisphere being towards dawn on the dusk side, and\nN. Draper et al.: Cluster magnetotail observations of a tailward-travelling plasmoid 3681\ntowards dusk on the dawn side, and vice versa in the South-\nern Hemisphere.\nThe consequent shear in By at the surface of the plasma\nsheet is associated with a field-aligned current directed to-\nwards and away from the Earth which has the sense of the\n\u201cRegion 1\u201d current, i.e. Earthward at dawn, and tailward\nat dusk. This is shown in Fig. 14b, where we show a cut\nthrough the y-z plane in a region just Earthward of the re-\nconnection line. The pre-existing plasma sheet is located\non either side of the lozenge-shaped portion of the recently-\nreconnected plasma sheet, which is enhanced as a result of\nthe increased flux of closed field lines within it. A projec-\ntion of these newly-closed field lines onto this cross-section\nis depicted by the black lines; the shear in the By component\nbetween plasma sheet and lobe can clearly be seen. This re-\nsults in the current flow along the surface of the plasma sheet,\nwhich is depicted by circled blue crosses (current into the\npage) and dots (current out of the page). The current system\nis closed in the ionosphere and on the magnetopause.\nAt 03:05 UT, the Cluster spacecraft were located in the\nnorthern boundary of the plasma sheet (Bx is positive) and\ndetected an Earthward current, which places them in the\nnorthern, dawnward portion of the scenario presented above.\nHowever, the spacecraft were actually located 8RE from\nmidnight in the pre-midnight sector, from which we con-\nclude that the reconnection site and consequent current sys-\ntem were skewed to the pre-midnight sector at this time. Pre-\nvious observations show that substorm onsets are often lo-\ncated in the pre-midnight sector (e.g. Nagai et al., 1998).\nThe Vy velocities observed by the CIS instrument were in-\ndeed mainly negative (i.e. dawnward) during this interval, as\nthen expected (see Fig. 8). Following this, the spacecraft exit\nto the lobe. Upon re-entry at 03:30 UT, they detect a tailward\ncurrent in the lobe-plasma sheet boundary, again 8RE from\nmidnight. This then places the spacecraft in the northern,\nduskward portion of the reconnection structure, from which\nwe conclude that the reconnection region and current system\nhad become more centrally-located in the tail by this time,\nas may be expected. The sense of the Vy flow measured by\nCIS had also changed to become small but mainly duskward\ndirected.\nThe question of which substorm onset mechanism is re-\nsponsible for this substorm event is one that is difficult to re-\nsolve. The substorm onset was taken as 02:50 UT, the time at\nwhich Pi2 pulsations were detected at the PIN magnetometer\nstation located at 21 MLT and the development of a westward\nelectrojet. The westward electrojet subsequently developed\nat NAQ near midnight a few minutes later. The Pi2 pulsations\nwere simultaneous with a small dipolarisation at the location\nof the GOES 8 spacecraft in the 22:00 MLT sector in geo-\nstationary orbit, which was followed 5 min later by a larger\ndipolarization. Just one minute after onset at 02:51 UT, the\nCluster spacecraft detected the formation of a TCR 15RE\ndowntail, in the pre-midnight sector. At the same time there\nwas an electron injection detected by the LANL-01A space-\ncraft, in the 04:00 MLT sector in geostationary orbit. These\nsignatures were detected at very widely spaced locations in\n \n \nFigure 14 \n 43 \n \n \nFigure 14 \n 43 \nFig. 14. (a) cut through x-y plane of magnetosphere; (b) cut through\ny-z plane of magnetosphere.\nthe magnetotail, and since they all occurred within just one\nminute of each other it is not possible to distinguish the loca-\ntion of initial onset for this substorm. Furthermore, the large\nlocal time extent of this event suggests that this was the onset\nof the full expansion phase rather than a spatially localized\npseudobreakup.\nIt is worth noting that there was a further intensification\nof this substorm at \u223c03:15 UT detected by the ISL and PIN\nmagnetometer stations. There was also a dipolarization at\ngeostationary orbit detected by the GOES spacecraft at this\ntime, and this is also related to the intensifications of iono-\nspheric flow out of the polar cap depicted in the map potential\nplot for 03:14 to 03:16 UT (Fig. 3b). The Cluster spacecraft\nwere located in the lobe at this time, and no dipolarization\nwas detected at their location.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have brought together several data sets\nwhich give a good overview of the conditions in the iono-\nsphere, near-magnetosphere and magnetosphere during a\n3682 N. Draper et al.: Cluster magnetotail observations of a tailward-travelling plasmoid\nsubstorm event on 5 October 2002. Despite not resolving the\nquestion of which mechanism was responsible for the sub-\nstorm onset in this case, many other interesting findings have\nbeen presented. The magnetometer data set determines the\ntime of onset as 02:50 UT; the time when Pi2 pulsations were\nfirst detected for this substorm. The location of the substorm\nelectrojet is constrained using the magnetometer data, and\nLANL particle data infer the time at which plasma were in-\njected at geosynchronous orbit. A small Jy current detected\nbefore onset is lost a few minutes prior to onset. This in-\ndicates that the spacecraft detected the rapid thinning of the\nplasma sheet under the spacecraft prior to onset, i.e. during\nthe growth phase. The negative z component of the magnetic\nfield at substorm onset coupled with a large time delay be-\nfore detection of Earthward flows is most easily explained\nby the formation of a tailward-moving plasmoid, produc-\ning a TCR at onset. The near-Earth neutral line therefore\nformed somewhere Earthward of the Cluster spacecraft at\ntheir location of \u223c15RE downtail. Importantly, the Clus-\nter spacecraft detected Region 1 currents during this inter-\nval flowing at the surface of the plasma sheet. In contrast to\nthe usual SCW picture, these Region 1 currents were asso-\nciated mainly with By varying in the z direction, rather than\nBz varying in the y direction. Initially these currents were\npredominantly Earthward-directed as the spacecraft left the\nplasma sheet, then later were tailward-directed as the space-\ncraft re-entered the plasma sheet. These findings indicate\nthat the Region 1 currents were initially skewed towards the\npre-midnight sector, and later became more centrally-located\nabout the midnight sector. This is consistent with previous\nfindings that place substorm onset in the pre-midnight sector\nof the magnetotail.\nAcknowledgements.
