Taylor? \nUniversity of Liverpool, U.K. \nThis paper examines whether patterns in communication behavior over \ntime can predict the outcome of crisis negotiations. A sample of 189 \ninteraction episodes was transcribed from 9 resolved negotiations and \ncoded according to differences in the degree and type of behavior. Par-\ntial order scalogram analysis (POSAC) was used to produce a \ngraphical representation of the similarities and differences among \nepisodes while simultaneously uncovering the role of each behavior in \nshaping the negotiation process. Results showed that episodes could be \nrepresented along a partially ordered scale of competitiveness, which \nwas structured by the occurrence of two types of behavior: Distributive\u2013\nExpressive and Integrative\u2013Instrumental. The likelihood of negotiation \nsuccess reduced with movement up the competitive scale, and \nnegotiations involving episodes that passed a threshold of extreme \ncompetition on the scale inevitably ended unsuccessfully regardless of \nfuture developments. As negotiations developed over time, behavior \nalternated bet ween periods of increasing cooperation and periods of \nincreasing competition, with unsuccessful negotiations associated with a \nconcluding trend of increasing competitive behavior. \nOne of the most compelling difficulties for hostage incident commanders is to \nmake a decision about the appropriateness of continuing negotiations relative to \nimplementing a tactical solution. This decision relies on using current dialogue to \npredict whether further interaction will lead to agreement, and so exemplifies \nresearch that attempts to discriminate high-risk cases based on information about a \nset of behavioral predictors (Taylor, Bennell, & Snook, 2002). The problem of pre-\n                                                               \n?

This \nresearch is based in part on work towards the author\u2019s thesis, supervised by Ian Donald. \n2 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \ndicting negotiation outcome has been tackled by various authors using a variety of \ncriteria (Holmes, 1991), but little consensus seems to have been reached as to what \nmay be the most fruitful way. For example, studies that relate differences in the \nfrequency of behavior use to outcomes are often criticized for not paying sufficient \nattention to how the order of issue consideration over time affects progress. Simi-\nlarly, decision rules developed by practitioners often have a form and output that is \neasier to apply and respond to than parametric statistics and probability values, but \npredictions from these rules are rarely linked to measurable units of behavior, and \nso may lack accuracy and reliability. Since each approach highlights a distinct but \nimportant aspect of the prediction problem, a major goal for research is to bring \ntogether the different features in a way that allows their relative predictive value to \nbe assessed.  \nThe current paper views the lack of previous attempts to integrate criteria of \ndifferent perspectives as having both conceptual and methodological roots: that is, \nconceptual understanding appears to have suffered from researchers using pre-\nferred methods that restrict possible analyses, while at the same time researchers \nfail to select other methods because the various facets of the negotiation process \nhave not been clearly conceptualized. Since conceptual requisites should drive any \nmethodological choice, the current paper begins by outlining three features that are \ncentral to previous solutions to the problem of predicting outcome. The three ideas \ncombine to posit a measure of negotiation dynamics that is structured by differ-\nences in the occurrence of actual behaviors and predicts the likelihood of negotia-\ntion success based on positions and patterns of change along its length. The need to \nconsider methodology is a consequence of this  conceptual framework, since \nsimultaneously testing many aspects of the negotiation process requires a multidi-\nmensional coding of dialogue that is not easily handled by traditional methods of \nanalysis. The predictions of the framework will instead be shown to fit neatly into a \npartial order of competitiveness along which outcome may be discriminated \naccording to both immediate and long-term patterns in the degree and type of dia-\nlogue. \nConceptualizing the Problem of Predicting Negotiation Outcome \nA Scale of Competitive Behavior \nOne important family of prognostic models comes from efforts to formalize \npersonal experiences into a set of coherent, integrated principles or decision rules \n(Bormann, 1980). The emphasis of this conceptual approach is to provide a clear \nyet brief set of criteria that can be employed at any point of time to help structure a \ndecision-maker\u2019s judgment about the degree of \u201csuccess\u201d in the current interaction. \nDiscrimination of outcome in these frameworks typically takes the form of an \nadditive scale, with the occurrence of more criteria implying increasing levels of \nantagonism and an increased likelihood of negotiation failure. For example, Noe-\nsier (1999) provides eleven indicators that relate to the dialogue and direct actions \nof perpetrators, where the absence of such features implies an increased risk to the \nhostages. A more dynamic actuarial system, described by Sarna (1997), involves \ntracking development over time by categorizing current communication issues as \n P. J. TAYLOR 3 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \n\u201cred\u201d (signs of trouble to be avoided) or \u201cgreen\u201d (signs of progress to be pursued). \nThe preponderance of red or green issues during interactions is proposed as an \nimportant indicator of progress and is considered a direct predictor of outcome. \nThe attractive and often overlooked feature of the experienced-driven \napproach is that differences among interactions can be meaningfully understood as \npoints along a partially ordered scale of increasing competition. Competition on \nsuch a scale is gauged by the extent to which negotiators attempt to maximize indi-\nvidual gain through dialogue that either attacks the other party or promotes a per-\nsonally beneficial position (Sarna, 1997). The scale is partially ordered because \nnegotiators consider only the amount of competition and do not judge different \nkinds of issues as inherently more or less competitive than other issues. Interac-\ntions placed at the same position on the scale, while considered to involve the same \ndegree of competitiveness, may be comprised of different types of competitiveness. \nSince these qualitative variations are not differentiated, the scale gives only a par-\ntial ordering of the interactions. \nAs an interaction unfolds, so the probability of negotiation success may be \nmeasured and tracked as movement along the competitive scale. Particular atten-\ntion is given to a pre-defined threshold on the scale that gives an optimal prediction \nof outcome. Dialogue falling above this point is believed to affect the relationship \nbetween parties in such a way that it causes future interaction to move towards \ninevitable failure. Although practitioners usually derive this threshold from experi-\nence, research on a range of high-risk problems has accumulated support for the \nidea of empirically deriving a \u201ccut point\u201d or \u201cprognostic threshold\u201d on a scale of \nincreasing likelihood (Swets, Dawes, & Monahan, 2000). For example, experi-\nmental research has long recognized the importance of reference points (Blount, \nThomas -Hunt, & Neale, 1996; Van Poucke & Buelens, 2002), where transition \nacross a point has been shown to significantly predict future bargaining and nego-\ntiation outcome. Similarly, studies developing scale -based questionnaires have \nidentified a number of communicative acts that are predictive of interpersonal con-\nflicts such as future marital failure (Gottman & Notarius, 2000) or physical vio-\nlence (Bilsky, Borg, & Wetzels, 1995). These acts arguably mark the point in con-\nflict where negotiation fails and individuals resort to using physical actions (against \nself or another) to bring about a resolution (Synder & Diesing, 1977). In terms of \nhostage crises, Abbott (1986) highlighted this danger point as a suicide phase of \ninteraction, where the level of negotiated interdependence between the parties \ndetermines whether interactions move the hostage taker towards either surrender-\ning or inflicting self-harm. Although Abbott\u2019s argument is for a specific threshold, \nRogan and Hammer (1995) have since shown that neutral message affect, as meas-\nured on a single intensity scale, provides a more general cut-point in the sense that \ndeviation away from this midpoint is related to negotiation outcome. In this sense, \nincrements along a competitive scale relate to increasingly conservative decision \nthresholds, which require more extreme levels of behavior to be present before the \nnegotiation is considered irreconcilable.  \nA partially ordered scale is a remarkably simple account of the negotiation \nprocess that has nevertheless attracted a great deal of attention and use. At least \npart of the scale\u2019s attractiveness is the result of several conceptual properties that \n4 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \ncome from using a single dimension to judge both the role of individual predictors \nand the likely outcome of negotiation. A common measure of possible interaction \ncontent avoids artificially vie wing a negotiation as either success or non-success \nrelated, since it is possible to estimate the severity of an interaction by what posi-\ntion it holds on the scale relative to other interactions. A scale defined by degree of \ncompetition contributes by pro viding a way to conceptualize and assess the roles \ndifferent communication behaviors play in moving a negotiation towards a resolu-\ntion. For example, while some behaviors make unique contributions to the bar-\ngaining process (and so make important predictors), others shape development in a \nsimilar way (i.e., are collinear) and so will add little more to the prediction of out-\ncome than is provided by one behavior alone. Other behaviors may only correlate \nwith negotiation outcome, while still further kinds may serve to accentuate or \nattenuate the impact of a determining behavior (i.e., moderate) (e.g., a threat of \naction reinforcing the impact of a demand). By focusing on the different ways in \nwhich behaviors affect a negotiation\u2019s placement on the competitive scale, research \ncan take an informed approach to refining the content of the predictive model and \nso may systematically improve prediction. Given these conceptual advantages and \nthe similarity among diverse accounts of outcome prediction, the current project \nexplicitly tests the existence of an underlying competitive scale, where increments \nalong the scale are associated with a higher probability of negotiation failure: \nHypothesis 1: Interactions of unsuccessful negotiations will be predomi-\nnantly associated with higher positions on a scale of increas-\ning competitiveness compared to interactions of successful \nnegotiations. \nAny evidence for this prediction would support the often-imposed restriction \nthat interactions may be differentiated along a scale of increasing competitiveness. \nHowever, even when well-defined, a scale by itself is insufficient for making a \nprediction because it relies on judgments of dialogue that are highly susceptible to \nbias, especially given the extreme cognitive demands associated with crises (e.g., \nreduced attention span, cognitive rigidity; Donohue, Ramesh, Kaufmann, & Smith, \n1991). Thus, despite repeated claims for a correspondence between conceptual \nmodels and negotiation outcome, reliable discrimination can only be achieved if \npoints on the competitive scale are associated with measurable communication \nbehaviors whose relationships to outcome can be systematically investigated. \nVariation in the Frequency and Type of Behavioral Predictors \nMost systematic attempts to link actual communication behaviors to negotia-\ntion success have compared aggregate data across a small number of variables \n(e.g., Neale & Bazerman, 1983, 1985; Olekalns, 1994, 1997; Weingart, Thompson, \nBazerman, & Carroll, 1990). In these studies, the mean frequency of behavior use \nis compared across successful and unsuccessful negotiations, and results are \nasserted in the form of overall tendencies. For example, one central distinction is \nbetween Integrative behavior, characterized by cooperation and normative problem \nsolving, and Distributive behavior, associated with coercive and aggressive \nattempts to move away from substantive discussion (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; \n P. J. TAYLOR 5 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nMiron & Goldstein, 1979; Weingart et al., 1990). These behaviors are frequently \nposited as interdependent orientations that produce a continuum of increasing \ncompetition (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; Putnam, 1990), and empirical evidence \nsupports this conceptualization (Donohue, Diez, & Hamilton, 1984; Taylor 2002). \nResearch has shown that successful negotiations are associated with more frequent \nuse of Integrative behaviors such as a willingness to make concessions, exchange \ninformation, and support the other\u2019s emotional needs (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; \nOlekalns & Smith, 2000; Putnam & Wilson, 1989). In contrast, frequent use of \nDistributive behaviors such as argumentative expressions, personal attacks, and \nunrealistic demands, reflect a contentious attitude towards interaction that is more \nlikely to result in negotiation failure (Folger, Poole, & Stutman, 1993; Putnam & \nWilson, 1989).  \nResearch has also shown that negotiators use different kinds of Integrative or \nDistributive behavior to pursue a variety of different concerns or goals (Taylor, \n2002; Wilson & Putnam, 1990). For example, messages about Expressive issues \nsuch as trust and affiliation are equally as important to the progress of negotiation \nas communication about more Instrumental task-related issues (Donohue, Lyles, & \nRogan, 1989; Natslandsmyr & Rognes, 1995; Putnam, 1994). Negotiators may \npursue an Integrative approach to Instrumental goals by communicating agreement \nand suggesting win\u2013win solutions, but they may also adopt a Distributive approach \nto Instrumental issues through rejecting offers, making demands and suggesting \nunreasonable alternatives. Similarly, at other times, negotiators may address \nExpressive issues by emphasizing behaviors that manipulate relational develop-\nment (e.g., criticism, humor) or show concern for the other party\u2019s or personal \nidentity (e.g., insult, empathy). Such qualitative differences in communication are \nlikely to be particularly evident in hostage crises, since the majority of cases \nencountered by law enforcement occur as a result of hostage takers\u2019 mental or \nemotional inability to cope with life stressors (Rogan, Hammer, & Van Zandt, \n1994).  \nThe implication of these studies is that degree and type of communication \nbehavior affects how a negotiation unfolds and so both aspects must be incorpo-\nrated into the observable units of the predictive framework. The continuum inter-\npretation of Integrative and Distributive behaviors fits nicely within the current \napproach by aligning with the cooperative and competitive ends of the hypothe-\nsized scale. Successful negotiations (associated with low regions of the competitive \nscale) would be predicted to involve more frequent use of Integrative behaviors, \nwhile unsuccessful negotiations (associated with the upper portion of the scale) \nwould be expected to be predominantly associated with the occurrence of Distribu-\ntive behaviors. Different qualities of Integrative and Distributive behavior may \nmoderate these predicted associations, but only to the point of affecting the degree \nof the relationship between behavioral occurrence and scale placement and not the \nactual direction of this relationship (Taylor, 2002). Following this line of argument: \n6 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nHypothesis 2a: Movement up the competitive scale will be associated with \nincreasing frequency of Instrumental and Expressive types of \nDistributive behaviors.  \nHypothesis 2b: Movement down the competitive scale will be associated \nwith increasing frequency of Instrumental and Expressive \ntypes of Integrative behaviors.  \nHowever, while support for these predictions will indicate the role behavioral \nfrequency plays in determining outcome, it does not speak to the changing impor-\ntance of these behaviors over the longitudinal structure of negotiation (Holmes & \nSykes, 1993). Consequently, the possibility remains that highly predictive behav-\niors may become less useful over time, or that trends of behavior across episodes, \nrather than absolute values within episodes, are a better criterion for predicting \noutcome.   \nChanging Patterns of Behavior Over Time  \nThe affect of message order on the progress of a negotiation is the central \nfocus of phase analyses (Holmes & Sykes, 1993), prescriptive models of negotia-\ntion development (Donohue et al., 1991), and a wealth of research on persuasion \n(Erwin, 2001). One approach to examining temporal differences has continued to \nstudy the relationship between outcome and variance in behavior use, but done so \nover a small number of time stages. These designs, when analyzed \u201cwithin-sub-\njects,\u201d can give some indication of how changes in the aggregate use of behaviors \nover time relate to negotiation outcome. Studies have shown that the final stage of \nsuccessful negotiations is typically associated with increased creativity and reduced \nlevels of positional arguing, whereas poor outcomes result from ineffective rela -\ntionship management in the first half of negotiations and excessive co mpetitive \nbargaining in the final stages (Jones, 1988; Putnam, Wilson, & Turner, 1990; \nSimons, 1993). More recent studies have associated outcome with the degree \nnegotiators reciprocate the other party\u2019s use of Integrative or Distributive behavior, \nwith sequences of Distributive behavior typically moving interactions toward less \nsuccessful outcomes (Olekalns & Smith, 2000; Weingart, Prietula, Hyder, & \nGenovese, 1999). Such findings are consistent with stage models of negotiation \n(Putnam, 1990), which view both Integrative and Distributive tactics as surfacing \nin dialogue during all stages of a negotiation, but associate unsuccessful negotia-\ntions with a final stage of high Distributive behavior. \nThe results of within-subjects studies have led researchers to associate the \nprediction of outcome with broad trends in communication that culminate (and so \ncan be best observed) in the final stages of interaction. However, pointing to the \nhigh levels of within-subject variance in such studies, several authors have argued \nthat simply incorporating a time factor is not sufficient to capture the complex \ndynamics of the negotiation process (Holmes, 1991). Evidence supporting this \nclaim is orientated towards mapping out phases or episodes of activity over time, \nwhere an episode is a discrete period of dialogue focused on a single issue. Studies \nusing phase analysis have demonstrated that quite complex changes in the focus of \ninteraction underpin the larger trends towards problem-solving identified in within-\n P. J. TAYLOR 7 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nsubject studies (Donohue & Roberto, 1993; Holmes & Sykes, 1993). Negotiators \nmay rapidly switch between cooperation and competition to deal with multiple \nconcerns, return to previous phases of interaction as additional information sur-\nfaces, or skip phases entirely to avoid impasse. The implication of such dynamics \nis a more fluid pattern of change over time as negotiators use periods of increasing \n(and decreasing) competition and cooperation to move through their various con-\ncerns. Yet even in the phase perspective, it is  the extent to which negotiators coop-\nerate during a final resolution stage of interaction that determines the eventual out-\ncome of a negotiation. The phase studies, therefore, concur with the findings of \nwithin-subject studies, suggesting that localized complex patterns of behavior give \nrise to larger-scale, global trends that may be equally important predictors of nego-\ntiation outcome, particularly during the final stages of interaction. \nGiven a sufficient number of time periods, previous research would lead to \nthe expectation that negotiation dialogue will produce several gradual movements \nup and down the competitive scale (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; Putnam, 1990). \nHowever, if the underlying scale accurately discriminates outcomes based on the \nglobal patterns in behavior, then it follows that successful and unsuccessful out-\ncomes will be associated with final trends towards cooperative and competitive \nends of the scale respectively. Thus, it is predicted: \nHypothesis 3a : Unsuccessful negotiations will be characterized by episodes \nthat show a final upward trend of movement along the com-\npetitive scale. \nHypothesis 3b : Successful negotiations will be characterized by episodes that \nshow a final downward trend of movement along the com-\npetitive scale. \nMethod \nTranscription Data \nThe data were a convenience sample of chronological transcripts from nine \nactual hostage crises. The accounts were produced from audiotape recordings of \nnegotiations collected from the archives of various U.S. police departments, and \nhave been used effectively in previous research (e.g., Donohue & Roberto, 1996; \nTaylor, 2002). The final transcripts represented a diverse set of negotiations, from \n\u201ccriminal\u201d incidents in which an individual negotiates to gain some material bene-\nfit, to \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201cdomestic\u201d incidents, where the hostage taker\u2019s focus is \non attracting sympathy for a personal need. This range of incidents was sufficiently \ndiverse to embody what previous research has shown reflects police officers\u2019 per-\nceptions regarding the distinguishing goals and orientations of hostage takers \n(Donohue & Roberto, 1993).  \nClassification of Outcome. In order to test the hypotheses concerned with \nnegotiation outcome, it was necessary to generate a criterion for classifying each \nnegotiation as successful or unsuccessful. Although any such categorization \nremains impressionistic and open to criticism, the criterion for unsuccessful inci-\ndents was that law enforcement officials were forced to employ some form of tacti-\ncal intervention (see also Holmes, 1991). It is important to emphasize that this cri-\n8 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nterion focuses only on the effectiveness of negotiation as a strategy for concluding \nan incident, and not on whether the outcome itself was successful (i.e., tactical \nresolutions may also yield successful outcomes). This exclusion criterion, there-\nfore, possesses some validity because it only assumes that law enforcement opera-\ntions will seek a negotiated surrender prior to being forced to resort to any form of \ntactical intervention. This assumption is supported by previous research (Butler, \nLeitenberg, & Fuselier, 1993; Fuselier, 1988).  \nApplication of this criterion was based on a reading of the transcripts, but was \nverified by cross-referencing to accompanying incident summaries and reports in \nlocal and national newspapers. Five negotiations were classed as unsuccessful \n(Cases A through E) while the remaining four negotiations were classed as suc-\ncessful (Cases F through I). Successful and unsuccessful negotiations differed in \ncomposition, with successful negotiations involving more episodes (M = 24.3) \ncompared to unsuccessful negotiations (M = 18.4), but less thought units per epi-\nsode (M = 96.9, SD = 37.2, Range 14\u2013 208) in comparison to unsuccessful incidents \n(M = 109.4, SD = 56.3, Range = 14\u2013233). Table 1 gives details of the scenario and \noutcome of each transcript, together with a decomposition of talk fre quencies. \nTable 1 \nSummary of Nine Crisis Negotiations \nCase Outcome Scenario and Composition \nCase A \nCriminal \nUnsuccessful An armed male\u2013female couple held a manager hostage \nafter being caught attempting a bank robbery. The law \nenforcement officers successfully negotiate for release of \nthe female bank manager but are unable to dissuade the \nhostage takers from committing suicide. The negotiation \ncontained 3291 thought units: 1405 (42%) hostage taker, \n911 (28%) police negotiator, and 975 (30%) friends of \nthe perpetrators. \nCase B \nCriminal \nUnsuccessful An armed male seized an elderly couple hostage in their \nhome after fleeing police arrest for shooting an officer \nduring an attempted bank robbery. The hostage taker \nshows extreme agitation following a conversation with \nhis mother, and the police were forced to use a tactical \nassault to conclude the incident. This case consisted of \n516 thought units: 233 (44%) hostage taker, 261 (50%) \npolice negotiator, and 32 (6%) others including the hos-\ntages and the hostage taker\u2019s relatives. \nCase C \nCriminal \nUnsuccessful A male perpetrator demands a financial reward in \nexchange for the negotiator\u2019s son. The police authorities \nare unaware of the hostage taker\u2019s location and several \narranged rendezvous fail to engender a successful reso-\nlution to the situation. The incident contained 447 \nthought units: 190 (43%) hostage taker, 225 (50%) offi-\ncial negotiator, and 32 (7%) other individuals. \n Table 1 (contd.) \n P. J. TAYLOR 9 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nCase D \nCriminal \nUnsuccessful An armed, emotionally unstable individual barricaded \nhimself at home after shooting and critically injuring a \nfamily member. The interactions oscillate between the \nlocal senior negotiating officer and a second police offi-\ncer, who is a friend of the hostage taker, but neither is \nable to convince him to surrender. The transcription con-\nsisted of 5441 thought units: 2421 (44%) hostage taker, \n(49%) police officer, and 357 (7%) other individuals. \nCase E \nPolitical \nUnsuccessful An armed male\u2013female couple hijacked a local bus to \npublicize a religious cult and commit suicide in accor-\ndance with prophecy. Although the interactions pro-\ngressed as negotiators promised television coverage in \nreturn for release of the hostages, subsequent interactions \nfailed to dissuade the couple from committing suicide. \nThe incident contained 336 thought units: 217 (64%) \nhostage taker, 47 (14%) police negotiator, and 72 (22%) \nother individuals. \nCase F \nCriminal \nSuccessful A single armed individual negotiating with two law \nenforcement officers after taking a female bank clerk \nhostage to mitigate an unsuccessful robbery. The police \nnegotiators initially acted to secure the release of the \nfemale hostage, but when this proved unfruitful they refo-\ncused efforts on convincing the hostage taker to com-\npletely surrender. The incident contained 1102 thought \nunits: 437 (40%) hostage taker, 652 (59%) police nego-\ntiator, and 13 (1%) other individuals. \nCase G \nDomestic \nSuccessful A single male held his six-month old daughter hostage in \nan attempt to persuade the child\u2019s mother to retry life as a \nfamily. The hostage taker releases the child to his mother \nand then shortly afterwards surrenders himself to police \nauthorities. The negotiation contains 2261 thought units: \n911 (40%) hostage taker, 889 (39%) police negotiator, \nand 461 (21%) hostage taker\u2019s mother and girlfriend. \nCase H \nPolitical \nSuccessful A plane hijacking in which an unarmed male held two \npilots hostage in order to speak with his girlfriend and get \nadequate help for drug rehabilitation. As the negotiations \nprogressed, the hostage taker released one of the pilots in \nexchange for a conversation with his girlfriend, following \nwhich he surrendered to law enforcement authorities. The \nincident lasted for 1500 thought units: 667 (45%) hostage \ntaker, 635 (42%) police negotiator, and 198 (13%) other \nindividuals. \nCase I \nPrison \nSuccessful A prison incident in which inmates took hostage several \nguards to negotiate for improved living standards. The \nnegotiation progresses slowly until a mutually trusted \nthird-party formulated an agreement that persuaded the \nprisoners to return peacefully to their cells. The transcript \nreports 4508 thought units: 2142 (48%) hostage taker and \n2366 (52%) police negotiator. \n10 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nTranscript Coding Procedure \nThe nine transcripts were subjected to a coding procedure that consisted of \nthree sequential stages: a rhetorical structure analysis, unitization, and content \ncoding. \nRhetorical Structure Analysis. A rhetorical structure analysis was used to \ndivide the transcripts into episodes of dialogue so that analysis would capture some \nof the changing patterns of behavioral occurrences over time. Episodes were \ndefined as non-overlapping segments of dialogue during which negotiators com-\nmunicated about a single, clearly distinguishable issue, without significant devia-\ntion (dialogue movement, Mann & Thompson, 1988) away from that issue. Each \nepisode therefore consisted of a discrete constellation of communication behaviors \nthat differed in their type and their degree of occurrence. By examining the behav-\nioral make-up of each constellation, it is possible to identify the behaviors that \ncharacterize the various episodes of interaction and track changes in these behav-\nioral emphases across the complete negotiation process. In the current interactions, \ndialogue movement often emerged at changes in the person or object of focus (e.g., \n\u201cHow\u2019s the kid doing?\u201d), or when the scope of interactions shifted between general \ndiscussion and specific issues (e.g., \u201cOk, let\u2019s talk in detail about the car\u201d). Simi-\nlarly, a large amount of episode movement occurred following a break in contact \nbetween the parties, especially if a different negotiator or a third party initiated the \nsubsequent interaction. \nThe rhetorical structure analysis identified 189 episodes across the 9 tran-\nscripts (M = 24.0, SD = 12.7, Range = 8\u201341), with a mean frequency of 103.0 \nthought units in each episode (SD = 47.8, Range = 14\u2013233). Although variation in \nthe number of units per episode may influence analysis by restricting the potential \noccurrences of behavior, it was considered important to include this factor because \nit reflects the natural variation in dialogue across the negotiations. Moreover, any \nattempt to equalize the content of each episode by using more precise divisions \nthan nuclear spans would have reduced the number of behaviors occurring to an \nunacceptably low level. Indeed, parsing the negotiations into episodes is a useful \nalternative to the arbitrary time -based divisions used in previous research (e.g., \nDonohue & Roberto, 1996; Putnam et al., 1990), because it establishes boundaries \nat shifts in the substantive focus of an interaction. Episode partitions may also \nenhance the operational value of the analysis  since significant changes in the focus \nof dialogue are likely to represent the only periods during which law enforcement \nofficers have sufficient time to evaluate progress and tactics. \nReliability of the episode partitions was tested by an independent coder who \nwas trained in rhetorical structure analysis through practice with unused materials. \nThe coder applied rhetorical structure analysis to all nine transcripts and achieved a \nunitizing reliability of .07 (Guetzkow, 1950), indicating discordance in about 7% \nof the episodes. Of the episodes boundaries identified by the coder, 98% were \nmatched in position to those in the original coding, suggesting that discordance was \nmainly due to disagreements about the number rather than the placement of \nboundaries. All disagreements were resolved through discussion and mutual \nagreement prior to partitioning into thought units. \n P. J.

The 189 interaction segments were further \ndivided into thought units (Gottman, 1979) to allow the coding of single communi-\ncation behaviors. At a conceptual level, a thought unit depicts a complete idea that \nan individual wishes to express, while in actual speech the unit occurs as an inde-\npendent clause with a subject and an object (e.g., \u201cGet your men away from \nthere\u201d). Coding at this level, therefore, comes closest to isolating single communi-\ncation acts and so minimizes the possibility of analysis overlooking smaller, but \npsychologically meaningful components of negotiators\u2019 dialogue. The unitizing \nreliability was assessed by having a second independent coder parse a subset of \n477 speaking turns into thought units. The coder agreed on the placement of 95% \nof the thought units, and achieved a unitizing reliability of .04 (Guetzkow, 1950), \nindicating that about 4% of the unitizing divisions were in error. All errors in unit-\nizing were addressed before the transcripts were coded. \nCoding of Communication Behaviors. The coding scheme consisted of four \nmain categories that were formed by joining two widely accepted classifications of \ncommunication behavior from previous negotiation research (see Table 2). The \nobjective of this coding scheme was not to provide an exhaustive categorization of \nbehavioral strategies, but to capture well-defined differences that are known to \nboth researchers and practitioners. The first distinction, central to a wide range of \nclassification schemes, was between Integrative (cooperative) and Distributive \n(competitive) behavior (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; Weingart et al., 1999). This \ndivision is a particularly useful starting point for the current study because previous \nevidence has shown that these orientations form the opposite ends of a continuum \nrunning from cooperation to competition. In order to capture the different kinds of \nissues that emerge during a crisis negotiation, a second distinction was made \nbetween Instrumental and Expressive behaviors. Substantive (Instrumental) and \nemotional (Expressive) issues reflect two dominant motivational goals whose \nvarying patterns of occurrences are likely to significantly affect the development of \na negotiation (Hammer & Rogan, 1997; Miron & Goldstein, 1979). Since negotia-\ntors can potentially communicate about Instrumental and Expressive issues using \nboth Integrative and Distributive approaches, these distinctions were combined to \nform four coding categories, namely, Distributive\u2013Instrumental, Integrative\u2013\nInstrumental, Distributive\u2013 Expressive and Integrative\u2013Expressive. A fifth Func-\ntional category was also used during coding to capture those aspects of dialogue \nthat contain no objective psychological information and act as the simple building \nblocks of interaction. The five behavioral categories together with examples are \nshown in Table 2. \nThe coding scheme was applied by the author to each thought unit within the \n189 interaction episodes, as they occurred in the sequential flow of dialogue. In \napplying the scheme to the content of each thought unit, it was not necessary to \napply categories exclusively (more than one category could be applied to each \nthought unit) since analysis intended to focus on relative differences in behavior. \nHowever, the restricted nature of the thought unit yielded a one-code to one-unit \ncorrespondence without exception. Reliability of the transcript coding was assessed \nby having two judges, experienced in content analysis but blind to the research \nhypotheses, independently code each thought unit in Case B. Agreement with the \n12 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nauthor\u2019s coding, measured using Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960), was .69 (Range \n.59 to .74) with 81% agreement for the first judge and .77 (Range .63 to .82) with \n86% for the second judge. Inter-judge coding achieved a reliability of .66 (Range \n.49 to .73) with 80% agreement. These Kappa values suggest a good level of cod-\ning reliability (Fleiss, 1981). \nTable 2 \nCoding Categories together with Examples \nCoding Cate-\ngory \nTranscript Examples \nDistributive\u2013 \nInstrumental \n\u201cBring me a couple packs of cigarettes\u201d. \n\u201cIf she comes here, I\u2019ll open fire\u201d. \n\u201cThey\u2019re ain\u2019t nobody going to see me responsible for noth-\ning\u201d. \n \nIntegrative\u2013 \nInstrumental  \n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll attempt to get you the cigarettes\u201d. \n\u201cI guarantee that nobody will hurt you\u201d. \n\u201cDo you people need medical attention?\u201d \n \nDistributive\u2013 \nExpressive \n\u201cYou sound a little bit immature to me\u201d. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have a pissing contest with you\u201d. \n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through this all my life, I\u2019ve lost and lost and lost, \nand I\u2019m tired of losing\u201d. \n \nIntegrative\u2013 \nExpressive \n\u201cWell, everybody has problems with girls\u201d. \n\u201cNobody has to convince me if good or bad about Johnny\u201d. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all saying what a great guy you are\u201d. \n \nFunctional \u201cHello\u201d. \n\u201cUh-huh\u201d. \n\u201cNah, really?\u201d \nIn accordance with previous research (Donohue & Roberto, 1996; Olekalns & \nSmith, 2000), the fifth Functional category was excluded from subsequent analysis \nbecause the behaviors it represents only aid exchange of information between \nspeakers. The role of such behaviors in shaping negotiation is not well understood \nand is most likely to be indirect. Consequently, their inclusion is likely to reduce \nthe ability of analysis to identify the systematic relationships between communica-\ntion behavior and outcome. For each episode of interaction, the remaining four \nbehavioral variables were scored according to the number of times they occurred in \nthe thought units of the episodes\u2019 dialogue. Scoring categories were absent (1), \noccurring at least seven times but less than fourteen times (2), and occurring four-\nteen or more times (3), with the scoring of variables Integrative\u2013Expressive and \nIntegrative\u2013Instrumental reversed to produce a common range in which positive \noccurrences reflected a higher level of competitiveness. These scoring divisions \nwere not arbitrary, but represent the rounding of one half a standard deviation \nabove and below the grand mean of occurrences for all four variables. This ensured \n P. J. TAYLOR 13 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nthat the distribution of scores over the variables was approximately equal, while \nstill allowing variability in category scores among each behavioral variable. The \nscoring approach also had the affect of eliminating the coding disagreements found \nduring the reliability check. Specifically, a re -analysis of agreement in the coding \nof Case B, compared as before across the judges and between each judge and the \nauthor, but this time calculated on the trichotomous scores at the level of episode, \nindicated that there were no differences in coding (All Cohen\u2019s Kappa = 1.00). The \nentire coding procedure resulted in a data matrix that crossed communication \nbehaviors (columns) with episodes of interaction (rows), such that each of the 189 \nepisodes had a score of 1, 2 or 3 on each of the four behavioral variables. \nAnalysis of Communication Behavior \nOne approach to data analysis that will simultaneously examine degree and \ntype of interaction episodes with respect to some underlying competitive scale is \npartial order scalogram analysis (Shye, 1985). A partial order analysis begins with \na number of criteria for differentiating an observed population, where each crite-\nrion provides one struct of an observed profile of structs for each member of the \npopulation. In the current project, these criteria are the four coded behavioral vari-\nables, and each population member is an interaction episode. Each episode, there-\nfore, has a profile composed of four structs, one struct for each behavioral variable, \nwhere each struct may have a value of 1, 2, or 3. The structs were arranged consis -\ntently for each profile and represented the following variables: Distributive\u2013\nInstrumental (first digit), Integrative\u2013Instrumental (second digit), Distributive\u2013\nExpressive (third digit), and Integrative\u2013Expressive (fourth digit). In other words, \nan episode\u2019s profile is simply a row of the data matrix which, in the current coding \nscheme, can range from 1111 through to 3333, with all combinations among these \ntwo extremes empirically possible. \nPartial order analysis compares each profile with every other profile on two \naxes. The first axis distinguishes degrees of competitiveness by comparing each \nprofile on the sum of scores across the four structs. An episode with profile x is \nconsidered more competitive than an episode with profile y if at least one struct of \nx has a higher score than the corresponding struct of y, and no struct of x has a \nlower score than its counterpart in y (e.g., compare 1221 and 1321). If one struct of \nx is higher than the corre sponding struct of y, but another struct of x is lower than \nits counterpart in y, then the profiles cannot be compared because they involve \ndifferent types of competitiveness. The second axis allows for instances when epi-\nsodes (profiles) have such non-comparable differences. Profiles that are non-com-\nparable exist if and only if profile x scores higher than profile y  on one struct yet \nlower than profile y  on a different struct. For example, an episode involving high \nlevels of Expressive behavior (e.g., 1122) will have a different combination of \nscores than one dominated by Instrumental behaviors (e.g., 2211), but both may \nhave an identical sum of scores across all four structs (e.g., total sum of structs is 6 \nin both cases). In conceptual terms, then, two episodes (profiles) are considered \ncomparable when one involves an overall more frequent use of competitive \nbehavior than the other. A pair of episodes are considered non-comparable if they \n14 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \ninvolve the same frequency of competitive behavior but differ in the extent this \nbehavior addresses Expressive and Instrumental concerns. \nAs a further illustration of the distinction between comparable and non-com-\nparable profiles, Figure 1 shows a partial order of profiles representing the final \nepisode of each negotiation. The scaling of final episodes represents one simple \ntest of the hypothesized disparity between successful and unsuccessful incidents, \nsince behaviors evident in this stage depict the climax of progression across the \ninteractions (Putnam, 1990). Figure 1 represents all the profiles as distinct points in \na two-dimensional space, where two profiles are connected by a line if their degree \nof competitiveness is comparable in the sense of the above definitions. One artifact \nof this rule is that each episode is positioned according to the sum of scores across \nthe four structs, with higher totals associated with higher rows in the partial order. \nThe highly competitive interaction of Case D (i.e., highest score, 3232) occupies \nthe uppermost position in the diagram, while the least competitive episodes of Case \nF and Case H (i.e., lowest scores, 1211 and 1112) appear at the lowest position. All \nother profiles hold intermediate positions in the space that are determined by their \nrelative comparability to one another. Profiles that differ in the type but not degree \nof competitiveness (non-comparable) are represented as spread along the horizontal \naxis. For example, several profiles have an identical sum of scores but quite dis -\ntinct structs across their profiles (e.g., Case B and Case I). As these profiles have \nequivalent totals but distinct patterns, they involve different kinds of dialogue, and \nso are positioned at opposing ends of the horizontal axis. In contrast, Case G \n(1312) is linked by a line (i.e., considered comparable) to Case E (1322) because \nits profile may be made equivalent to Case E\u2019s profile by increasing the score on \nthe third struct. Finally, notice that the rule determining comparability means that \nCase E (1322), while having a lower sum of scores across the four structs, is not \nconsidered comparable to Case C (2313), since to move from Case E to Case C it is \nnecessary to decrease the score on the third struct. \nIn conceptual terms, the partial order in Figure 1 provides a simplified picture \nof the complex similarities and differences among final interaction episodes. By \nmoving up the lines connecting points it is possible to identify paths of increasingly \ncompetitive interactions. Several paths emerge because final episodes involved \ndifferent types of competitiveness, as reflected by the spread along the horizontal \naxis. A larger distance between two episodes on the horizontal axis implies a \ngreater difference in the type of competitiveness. Representing the final episodes in \nthis way allows a clear exa mination of whether behavioral competitiveness can be \nused to predict outcome. This is addressed by the dotted line on Figure 1, which \nshows all but one successful negotiation as relatively lower in the partial order \ncompared to the five unsuccessful negotiations. The exception to this clear dis -\ncrimination of outcome is the successful negotiation of Case I, which has a profile \nequal in its sum of scores to the unsuccessful Cases B and E but different in the \ntype of behaviors involved. Indeed, the non-comparability of Case I\u2019s profile is \nresponsible for the crossing of the lines joining Case F to Case I and Case H to \nCase G, which suggests that this prison incident involved qualitatively different \ndynamics to those found in the criminal and domestic cases. This non-comparabil-\nity does not directly affect the intrinsic structure of the partial order, but it does \n P. J.

POSAC adopts the principles described above \nand represents the resulting variation among profiles as points in the geometric \nspace shown in Figure 2.1 This space is equivalent to that constructed in Figure 1 \nbut is rotated though 45 degrees such that increasing competitiveness is associated \nwith the diagonal running from bottom-left to top-right of the POSAC space. Epi-\nsodes with identical  profiles are represented in the POSAC space by the same point \nas there is neither a quantitative nor a qualitative basis for discriminating between \nthem. Profiles differing in the degree of competitiveness are ordered according to \ntheir sum of structs as points along the Joint axis from bottom-left (i.e., 1111) to \ntop-right (i.e., 3333). Profiles that involve the same degree of competitiveness but \ndiffer in the type of behavior (non-comparable) are represented as points spread \nalong the Lateral axis that spans from top-left to bottom-right. However, because \nnon-comparable profiles can occupy one of several positions along the Lateral axis \nwhile still preserving an order of increasing competitiveness, POSAC arranges the \nconfiguration so that the more structs  two profiles have in common, the closer their \nrepresentative points appear in the solution space. For example, the profiles 3311, \n2312, and 1133 would be distributed along the Lateral axis because they involve \nthe same degree of competitiveness (i.e., sum of structs = 8) but different types of \nbehavior (i.e., patterns of scores across the structs). In positioning these profiles, \nPOSAC would put 3311 and 2312 in close proximity since they have a common \nscore on the second and third struct, while 3311 and 1133 would be positioned at \nopposite ends of the Lateral axis because they have no structs in common. The \nepisodes represented by profiles 3311 and 1133 are considered to be more dis -\nsimilar in the type of occurring behavior than the profiles 3311 and 2312. \nIn general, POSAC determines the placement of profiles along the Joint and \nLateral axes through a regioning process in which profiles with the same score on a \nstruct (behavioral variable) are positioned closer together in the solution space than \nprofiles with different scores on that struct. Specifically, each struct of a profile is \nconsidered separately, and profiles with the same score on the struct being exam-\nined are positioned into a contiguous region of the solution space. Thus, for each \nstruct, POSAC attempts to position profiles in such a way that drawing straight \nlines through the solution space can separate profiles scoring a 1, 2 or 3 on the \nrelevant struct. POSAC continues to move profiles around the solution space and, \nconsequently, re-shapes the regions that encompass profiles with identical struct \nscores until each profile falls into the four contiguous regions that are appropriate \nfor its score on each of the four structs. The result of this regioning is a configura-\ntion in which each profile\u2019s placement is defined by the intersections of regions \nformed by each struct. \n                                                               \n1POSAC achieves a graphical configuration of points by assigning each profile a pair of \ncoordinates (ranging from 0 to 100) for the X and Y axes of the solution space \n P. J. TAYLOR 17 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nFigure 2 \nThe positioning of Joint and Lateral Axes in POSAC \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \nAs the shape of the regions\u2019 encompassing scores on one struct are dependent \non the scores that occur on the remaining structs, the relationship between regions \ncreated by one struct and regions formed by another struct may be examined to \nunderstand the role of each behavior in shaping the variations among profiles. For \nexample, some structs may generate regions whose boundaries form parallel divi-\nsions across the solution space. Since movement across the regions formed by one \nof these structs is related to movement across the regions formed by the second \nstruct, these structs (behaviors) play a similar role in differentiating the interactions \n(i.e., are collinear). Other behavioral variables may create regions that are perpen-\ndicular to one another. In this case, movement across the regions of one struct may \nbe achieved without moving across a region of the second struct, implying that \nthese aspects of dialogue play very different roles in shaping the similarities and \ndifferences among episodes. POSAC enables the role of each behavior to be sys-\ntematically assessed by providing a set of identical geometric plots, one for each \nstruct, in which the profiles are labeled with their score (i.e., 1, 2, or 3) on the struct \nbeing examined. These item plots may be examined for contiguous regions of \nscores, a process that is facilitated by POSAC providing a set of partitioning load-\ning coefficients. These coefficients range between 0.00 and 1.00, with a score of \n1.00 indicating that all episodes with a particular struct score may be partitioned \ninto a region of the solution space without exception. In general, a coefficient \nabove .80 is regarded as indicating that scores on a particular struct vary systemati-\ncally across the partial order and that, as a result, the configuration of regions for \nthat struct is likely to be unique and meaningful (Shye, 1985). \nPOSAC calculates six coefficients per item plot (behavioral variable) to give \nan impression as to the suitability of six major forms of partitioning. Examples of \nthe different types of partitioning are given in Figure 3. Of the six types of parti-\ntioning, two divide the solution space in alignment with the X and Y axes. Behav-\nioral variables operating in this way are particularly interesting because they give \nthe axes that define the position of profiles (episodes) within the space their pri-\nJoint axis \u2013 Degree of Behavior  \n(sum of structs) \n \nLateral axis \u2013 Type of Behavior  \n(pattern across structs) \n x       \n \ny \n \n18 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nmary meaning. These behavioral variables are therefore the two basic types of \ncompetitiveness that shape the differences among interaction episodes. A further \ntwo types of division align themselves with the diagonal axes, either forming \nregions along the competitive scale (J) or along the qualitative axis (L). Behavioral \nvariables dividing the space along the Joint axis relate exclusively to the degree of \ncompetitiveness in interactions, such that changes in the occurrence of this behav-\nior will be matched by correspond ing changes in the degree of competition. \nBehaviors aligned with the Lateral axis influence only the type of competitiveness \ninvolved and so influence only the concern or issue that is the focus of interaction. \nFinally, a struct may also adopt one of two secondary roles in partitioning the \nPOSAC space, either accentuating (Q) or attenuating (P) the possibilities to dis -\ncriminate between points that are high on X or Y.  Behavioral variables that \naccentuate the space increase the amount of qualitative variation in episodes at \nhigher points on the scale, while attenuating variables increase the homogeneity of \ninteractions such that profiles high on X will also be high on Y.  The interpretation \nof POSAC output is illustrated further in the Results section, but for additional \nexplanation and examples see Borg and Shye (1995), Dancer (1990), Porter and \nAlison (2001), and Shye (1985). \nFigure 3 \nIllustrations of the Six Major Types of Regions Formed by \nVariables  (structs) in POSAC. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBenefits of POSAC.  Although the question of predicting outcome in the cur-\nrent data may be addressed through a number of methodologies, POSAC\u2019s treat-\nment of the data offers a complementary alternative that has some attractive fea-\ntures. First, POSAC is one of the few techniques available that allows researchers \nto address the problem of discriminating outcome from behavior. The question \nPOSAC asks is: Suppose an episode has a known behavioral content but the out-\n X \n \n1        2        3 \n  J \n \n                    3 \n \n            2 \n \n   1 \nQ \n \n                      3 \n \n              2 \n \n    1   \nY \n          3 \n \n          2 \n \n          1  \nL \n \n   1 \n \n            2 \n \n                     3 \nP \n                     3 \n \n            2 \n \n   1 \n P. J. TAYLOR 19 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \ncome is unknown, what outcome should the episode be assigned, with minimal \nexpected error? This question is actually the reverse of that tackled by traditional \ntechniques such as analysis of variance (ANOVA), which ask: Suppose the out-\ncome of an episode is known but the frequencies of occurrence of its constituent \nbehaviors are unknown, what are the best predicted values of occurrence for these \nbehaviors? Unfortunately, insights into the problem of prediction are not generally \nforthcoming from studies analyzing variance, since these works have typically \nrelied on classical statistical measures (e.g., F, t, and ?) that give no indication of \nthe efficacy of discriminating outcome. Perfect discrimination of outcome can hold \nno matter what the size of these statistics (e.g., F, t and ? can approach unity, see \nGuttman, 1988). \nA second difference is that POSAC looks for regularities in the data without \nmaking any simplifying mathematical assumptions (e.g., linearity), since it com-\npares observations through inherent variations in composition rather than indirectly \nusing some extrinsic probability framework. By staying close to the original multi-\nvariate structure of the data, POSAC avoids omitting features of the data that may \nbe of theoretical importance or may reduce the explanatory power of any predictive \nmodel. Moreover, by not making any extrinsic assumptions of the data (e.g., nor-\nmality of distribution) POSAC can access the many types of real-world data that \ninterest conflict scholars but remain elusive because they violate traditional \nassumptions. Finally, rather than treat variables directly as the object of study, \nPOSAC offers a different scientific imagery that views observations as representa-\ntives of a domain space shaped by constructs in different ways.  By focusing on \nregional differences within a content space, it  is possible to gain an understanding \nof the \u201cquality\u201d or type of interrelationships among predictors that is not possible \nfrom a set of significance probabilities. More generally, comparing the mutual ori-\nentation of regions within the space can enable systematic comparisons of concepts \nor theories that are difficult to operationalize and test in quantitative terms. This \nimagery and the associated clarity brought by examining regions of the space have \nproven a fruitful basis for cumulative research in other areas of social science (e.g., \nDancer, 1990). \nResults \nThe 189 interaction episodes were represented by 60 distinct profiles (out of a \npossible 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81). A two-dimensional solution represented these profiles \nwith a coefficient of correct representation (CORREP) of .832, indicating that \napproximately 92% of profiles are placed in the correct regions of the configura-\ntion. Figure 4 shows a projection of the derived configuration in which each profile \nis denoted by its structs, and profiles suffixe d by a letter are the final episode of the \ncase with the corresponding letter in Table 1. An initial examination of the partially \nordered structure revealed a substantial amount of quantitative and qualitative \nspread in negotiation behavior, as shown by the even spatial distribution of points \nacross the configuration. For example, the final episode of interaction for Case D is \nlocated towards the top-right corner of the space as profile 3232, and concludes \nwith a higher degree of competitive behavior relative to the other negotiations. In\n20 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \ncontrast, the final episodes of Case C and Case I involve approximately equal lev-\nels of competitive behavior (as shown by the roughly equivalent positions they \noccupy in the Joint axis), but differ in the type of behavior that occurred (as indi-\ncated by their positions at opposite ends of the Lateral axis). Since the Joint direc-\ntion of the solution space represents the proposed competitive scale, the large dis -\ntribution of episodes along the Joint axis suggests that degree of competitiveness \nprovides a useful way of differentiating among interaction episodes. \nFigure 4 \nA Partial Order Scalogram Analysis with Co-Ordinates (POSAC) of 60 \nProfiles Derived from the 189 Interaction Episodes of 9 Crisis Negotiations \n \nNote: Cases underlined were the final episodes of unsuccessful negotiations \n3333\n3323\n2333\n3233\n2323\n2233\n1333\n3232:D\n3331\n2331:A\n2223\n3321\n3312\n1313:B\n1323\n1332\n2322\n2232\n3132\n3222\n1233\n3231\n3212\n3311\n1331\n2321\n2312\n1322:E\n2313:C\n3131\n1133\n2231\n2222:I\n1232\n3221\n2132\n2221\n1312:G\n3121\n2131\n1132\n2311\n2122\n1222\n1321\n1213\n3211\n1231\n1221\n1131\n3111\n1311\n2121\n1212\n2211\n1211:F\n1112:H\n1121\n2111\n1111\n P.

The role of each behavior in structuring the scale relates to \nHypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 2b, which predict movement up the scale to be asso-\nciated with regions denoting higher occurrences of Distributive behaviors and \nlower occurrences of Integrative behaviors. Figures 5a through 5d show the indi-\nvidual item diagrams in which each profile is labeled by its associated score on the \nbehavioral variable under examination. The plots also show the regions that \nemerge from POSAC\u2019s attempt to put identical profiles in congruent regions of the \nspace, and were divided according to the highest partitioning loading coefficient. \nFor the current behaviors, these coefficients suggest quite high levels of homoge-\nneity for scores in each region (M = .91, Range .78\u20131.00), although partitioning for \nthe item Distributive\u2013Instrumental yields a substantially higher level of error \nacross the three regions (i.e., .78). Although this higher level of heterogeneity lim-\nits the usefulness of Distributive\u2013Instrumental behavior as a component of the \nPOSAC space, it was considered acceptable given the latitude for error created by \nthe refined nature of coding and the complexities inherent in crisis negotiations \n(Donohue et al., 1991). \nAs shown in Figure 5a, the struct measuring Distributive\u2013Instrumental \nbehavior partitioned the solution space along the Joint direction, with increasing \nseverity towards the top-right corner of the plot. Since the Joint axis distinguishes \nthe various degrees of the partial order, the use of Distributive\u2013Instrumental \nbehaviors relates to parallel divisions along the competitive scale. In contrast, the \nstruct measuring Integrative\u2013Instrumental behavior (Figure 5b) plays a polar role \nin dividing the POSAC space, inducing roughly parallel regions along the X-axis \nthat concord with the prediction that movement up the scale is associated with less \noccurrence of the behavior. These regions are orthogonal to the regions formed by \nscores on the third Distributive\u2013Expressive struct (Figure 5c), which partition the \nspatial configuration into regions aligned with the vertical Y-axis. This suggests \nthat Integrative\u2013Instrumental and Distributive\u2013 Expressive behaviors are conceptu-\nally distinct elements of negotiation, which combine to structure the distribution of \nepisodes in the POSAC space. Finally, the struct measuring Integrative\u2013Expressive \nbehavior (Figure 5d) adopted a secondary role in structuring the solution space by \nforming inverted L-shaped divisions that were ordered in accordance with the \ncommon range. This accentuating partition produces a finer distinction of points \nthat are high on the X and Y base coordinates, implying that Integrative\u2013Expres-\nsive behavior will only occur when interactions involve low levels of Distributive\u2013\nExpressive communication and high levels of Integrative\u2013Instrumental behavior. \nIn relation to Hypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 2b, then, the positioning of \nregions denoting higher occurrence of Distributive behaviors towards the top-right \nof the configuration (Figures 5a and 5c) supports the prediction that increasing \ncompetition emerges with more frequent use of Distributive behaviors. In contrast, \nfor both Integrative behaviors (Figures 5b and 5d) the most salient feature of the \n22 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \n \nFigure 5a \nPartitioning of POSAC Output for \nDistributive \u2013 Instrumental Behaviors \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote: J partitioning loading coefficient = .78 \nFigure 5b \nPartitioning of POSAC Output for \nIntegrative \u2013 Instrumental Behaviors \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote: X partitioning loading coefficient = 1.00 \n3\n3\n2\n3\n2\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2\n2\n3\n3\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n2\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n2\n1\n3\n2\n2\n1\n3\n2 1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1 \n2 \n3 \n3\n3\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n3\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1 1\n3\n1\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 2 3 \n P.

The opposite \ndirection of these occurrences supports the hypothesized conceptualization of Inte-\ngrative and Distributive behavior as the antipodal points of a single partially \nordered scale. \nDiscriminating Successful and Unsuccessful Negotiations \nIf the competitive scale is useful for outcome prognosis, then the majority of \nepisodes associated with unsuccessful negotiations should be situated towards the \ntop-right of the configuration (i.e., higher on the scale) in comparison to episodes \nfrom successful negotiations (Hypothesis 1). To examine this prediction, Figure 6 \nshows the same POSAC configuration in which each profiles is labeled according \nto the number of success and non-success related episodes it represents. A profile \nis underlined if the majority of these episodes are associated with unsuccessful \nincidents. An examination of the partially ordered structure indicated that the final \nepisodes of unsuccessful incidents formed a region quite distinct from that occu-\npied by concluding episodes of successful incidents. These regions are divided by a \nsolid line on Figure 6. The differentiation between the two groups is so distinct that \nthe region that encapsulated the concluding episodes of unsuccessful incidents \ncontained only 13 incorrect predictions (6.9% of total episodes), isolated episodes \nfrom negotiations that ended successfully. Thus, an episode involving behavior \nwhose profile is located to the right of the discriminating level would be prognosed \nas almost certainly ending unsuccessfully, even when subsequent interactions fall \nbelow this critical threshold. \nAlthough the division could have appeared in any direction of the POSAC \nspace, its approximately perpendicular relation to the Joint axis indicates that a \nthreshold on the competitive scale provides an almost perfect function for the \nprognosis of outcome. A corollary of this finding is that the best discrimination is \ngiven by the linear sum of the X and Y coordinates, since these coordinates define \nwhere an episode is placed on the Joint axis . In other words, the relationship \nbetween outcome and the partial order is through the Joint direction of the POSAC \nspace, which is essentially a refinement of the sum frequency of occurrence of the \ntwo behaviors that divide the X and Y axis: Distributive\u2013Expressive and Integra-\ntive\u2013Instrumental. The sum of these two base coordinates produces a Joint score \n(which ranges from 0 to 200), according to which a final episode of interaction \nscoring over 98.31 is associated with an unsuccessful negotiation. \nFurthermore, because in the current case the partition between successful and \nunsuccessful episodes runs perpendicular to the Joint axis, the rank sum of scores \nacross the structs gives the same ranking as the Joint score. This means that the \nsum of scores across the structs of a profile turns out to give an equally good dis -\ncrimination of negotiation outcome as the Joint score. In the current project, a final \nepisode whose sum of scores across the structs is equal to or greater than 8 (12 is \nthe highest score according to the present classification) will end in failure, \nregardless of the position of these scores in the profile. In other words, the progno-\nsis of outcome relates directly to the degree of competitiveness in interaction and is \nnot particularly influenced by the kind of behavior that occurs. \n P. J.

For instance, the broken line overlaid \nin Figure 6 produces a region containing 54 (59%) of the interactions relating to \nunsuccessful negotiations while only incorrectly partitioning 23 (24%) of the suc-\ncess-related interactions. This leaves only 41% of unsuccess ful episodes, but over \n76% of successful episodes in the broad lower region. More generally, the prob-\nability of encompassing episodes related to successful negotiations within a region \nincreases with perpendicular movement down the Joint axis. This can be shown by \ncalculating odds ratios for the various thresholds along the scale. For example, epi-\nsodes falling above the solid line are 2.62 times more likely to be associated with \nunsuccessful rather than successful negotiations. In contrast, episodes falling \nbetween the solid line and the broken line are 2.00 times more likely to be unsuc-\ncessful, while episodes falling below the broken line are 1.95 times more likely to \nend in success. \nLongitudinal Trend along the Distributive Partial-Order \nThe possibility of a refined discrimination illustrates the potential for identi-\nfying the hypothesized long-term trends in negotiators\u2019 behavior across the epi-\nsodes. In order to examine movement along the scale as a negotiation unfolds, the \nJoint score of episodes from each case were analyzed as a function of time. The \ndevelopment was modeled by fitting successive trend lines (polytonic curves) until \nreaching an acceptable approximation of the change in the degree of competitive-\nness over the negotiation. Although the number of curve intervals required to ade-\nquately capture the developments over time is of interest, a test of the hypotheses is \ngiven by the slope of the final interval of the fitted curve. A positive or negative \ntrend in the Joint score at this stage denotes increasing competitive or cooperative \nbehavior respectively, and so allows a test of whether this global aspect of behavior \ncan differentiate outcome (Hypothesis 3a and Hypothesis 3b). \nFor each case, Table 3 gives the coefficient of weak polytonicity (? , Gutt-\nman, 1986) for the best fitting model of change in Joint score. The polytonicity \ncoefficient indicates the extent to which change in a sequence of numbers (e.g., \nJoint scores) has an upward or downward trend that corresponds with the model \nunder consideration. The polytonicity coefficient is actually a generalization of the \nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficient that considers only inequalities across scores and \nis not restricted to considering linear (quantitatively equivalent) changes over time. \nThe coefficient, therefore, considers the extent to which data have increasing and \ndecreasing trends or \u201ctones\u201d over time, where the number of tones denotes the \nnumber of allowed changes in direction. For example, a monotone trend measures \nthe extent to which the Joint score increases (or decreases) over time, while a due-\ntone trend has two intervals, and so measures the extent changes follow a \u201cU\u201d (? ? ) \nor \u201cinverted U\u201d (?? ) pattern over time. The polytonicity coefficient ranges from \u2013\n1.00 to 1.00, where unity represents a perfect fit between the data and the consid-\nered model, and the sign of the coefficient indicates whether the initial trend is \npositive or negative. This more general notion of trend aligns itself nicely with the \nhypothesized changes in competitiveness over time (Hypothesis 3a and Hypothesis \n3b) without imposing the extrinsic, unnecessary assumption that change from epi-\nsode to episode is constant. \n P. J. TAYLOR 27 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nSelection of the best fitting polytonic model proceeded hierarchically with \nterms added until ?  failed to increase by .05 (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). The linear \ncorrelation statistic (R2) and standardized regression coefficients (\u00df) are also \nreported in Table 3 as an estimate of the extent changes in Joint score are predict-\nable from the model. Because R2 makes the unnecessary assumption of linearity \namong scores, the coefficients reported represent a conservative lower-bounds \nestimate of the amount of variance accounted for by the model. The standardized \nregression coefficients continue to give a meaningful index of the average rate of \nchange in the Joint score for each interval of the curve. So, for example, Case A \nwas most appropriately modeled by a duetone curve that initially decreased in \ncompetitiveness but then increased in competitiveness (? = \u2013.41). The Joint score \nshowed very little change across the episodes (\u00df [first tone] = \u2013.75 and \u00df [second \ntone] = .90) such that the model was only able to account for approximately 6% of \nthe variance over time. \nTable 3 \nCurve Estimation of POSAC Joint Scores on Episodes over Time for \nNine Crisis Negotiations as a Function of Success \nOutcome Crisis \nNegotiation \nDir.

Three cases (Case A, Case C, and Case D) were \nadequately modeled by a duetone trend, which initially showed good progress but \nbecame increasingly distributive during later stages of interactions. The predicted \nupward movement is also evident in Case E, which is adequately modeled by a \ntritone curve where the final interval involved rapidly increasing competitive \nbehavior. An exception was the developing sequence of interactions in Case B, \nwhich yielded a tritone curve whose final interval was a shallow slope of decreas-\ning competitive behavior, thereby contradicting the hypothesized direction of \nincreasing competitiveness. \n28 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nThe lower half of Table 3 shows that all but one of the successful incidents \nwere best modeled by an overall decrease in competitiveness (Joint score). Specifi-\ncally, the analysis indicated that a duetone curve provided a good approximation of \ndevelopment in Case F and Case G, while Case H required a more comple x tritone \nmodel that concluded with decreasing competition. In contrast, Case I did not fit \nthe hypothesized pattern of development and was characterized by increasing com-\npetitive behavior during the final episodes of interaction. \nAn examination of the linear regression data for each incident provides a \nfurther test of the third set of hypotheses because it gives an indication of how well \nthe simple trend models account for actual variation in behavior over time. The \nregression models accounted for approxi mately 25% of change in Joint score for \nunsuccessful incidents (Mean R2 = .25) and at least 18% of development in \nsuccessful negotiations (Mean R2 = .18). These statistics are impressive since they \nsuggest that more than one fifth of change in negotiators\u2019 behavior may be \naccounted for by trends along a partially ordered scale of competitiveness. This \nsignificance is particularly true given the conservative assumptions adopted in \ncalculating the R2 statistic and the tremendous number of environmental \ncontingencies that are likely to affect negotiators\u2019 behavior. \nDiscussion \nOne major goal of negotiation research has been to derive a model of com-\nmunication behavior that may be used to inform inferences about the progress and \nprobable outcome of interactions (Abbott, 1986; Sarna, 1997). The current \napproach differs from previous attempts to model the relationship between behav-\niors and outcomes in several important ways. One distinction is that differences \namong interactions are conceptualized as points along a competitive scale where \nthey were associated with varying probabilities of success rather than simply \ndichotomized as success or non-success related. Examining interactions in relation \nto a measurement scale allowed POSAC to demonstrate that every episode could \nbe summarized by a single score whose relative value corresponded to the prob-\nability of negotiation success. A second difference is the focus on understanding \nthe way in which interrelationships among the different degrees and types of com-\nmunicat ion behavior structure the competitive scale. This moves beyond examin-\ning the relationships between single behaviors and outcomes, and towards explic -\nitly tracking how negotiators use constellations of behaviors to pursue their com-\nplex and often contradictory goals. A third methodological distinction is the pro-\nject\u2019s focus on determining how well similarities and differences in communication \nbehavior enable accurate discrimination of negotiation outcome. This is in contrast \nto \u201cpartitioning of variance\u201d (e.g., ANOVA) which can tell very little about effi-\ncacy of discriminating outcome, and is often misunderstood in this regard. \nThe project showed that differences in communication behavior across 189 \ninteraction episodes may be adequately modeled using a two-dimensional space \ndefined by a partially ordered scale of increasing competitiveness. Furthermore, a \nthreshold on this competitive dimension was shown to provide an optimal dis -\ncrimination of outcome, with episodes associated with unsuccessful negotiations \n P. J. TAYLOR 29 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nfalling, on average, at higher points on the scale than episodes related to successful \nincidents. These findings provide empirical justification for viewing hostage nego-\ntiations as \u201ccrisis bargaining\u201d (Donohue et al., 1991), in which progress may be \njudged by the extent a competitive crisis response is supplanted by a more coop-\nerative problem-solving approach to interactions. However, while a one-dimen-\nsional competitive scale, backed by theory, illustrates that very simple patterns \nunderlie what is traditionally viewed as a complex process, the true importance of \nshowing that negotiation can be modeled in this way lies elsewhere. If a scale is \nconsistently found over replications with different samples of variables (and across \ndifferent transcripts), then it might be inferred, by way of generalization, that the \nnegotiation process itself is scalable. In other words, it may be possible to identify \npatterns in communication that are independent of the behaviors or coding scheme \nexamined, thereby identifying regularities that form the basis of a general theory of \nthe negotiation process. Revealing regularities in communication that transcend the \nvariety of possible coding schemes is likely to be particularly important to cumula-\ntive progress in communication research. \nIn order to understand the dynamics that cause different levels of competition \namong episodes, the current paper identified the roles each behavior played in \nstructuring the two -dimensional space. Of particular importance in defining this \nprognostic scale were the behavioral groups Distributive\u2013Expressive and Integra-\ntive\u2013Instrumental, which adopted orthogonal (base) roles in structuring the repre-\nsentative axes of the POSAC space. The content of these base items show empiri-\ncally what practitioners have long observed, namely, that negotiation success is \ndependent on the reduction of mistrust and psychological distance between parties \nand the development of a cooperative problem-solving environment. In other \nwords, a failure to either generate interest in substantive problem solving or control \nthe level of expressive hostility in dialogue is the principle reason negotiations \nmove beyond the threshold and towards inevitable failure. The POSAC analysis \ntherefore moves beyond many previous results to identify two qualitatively differ-\nent types of risk behavior; an extreme level of one of these types or a high level of \nboth types was found suggestive of future negotiation failure. Thus, occurrence of \nan episode that involves behavior located by the prognosis items as above the dis -\ncriminant level may be used to alert negotiators to possible impending trouble. A \npreponderance of interactions above this level should prompt the decision-maker to \nconsider resorting to tactical intervention. This final decision should take into \naccount a number of other external factors (e.g., type of hostage taker, number of \nhostages), since such factors may influence the extent to which interactions orien-\ntate around changes in the base dimensions of Distributive\u2013Expressive and Inte-\ngrative\u2013Instrumental behavior. \nHowever, interestingly, the fact that the interrelationships among the commu -\nnication behaviors could be well-represented in a two -dimensional space means \nthat discrimination of any such outside factor (e.g., types  of hostage taker) from \nthese behaviors should be at most two -dimensional. For example, a researcher pre-\ndicting that negotiators\u2019 gender leads to difference in communication behavior \nwould need to show that episodes involving male negotiators and episodes  involv-\ning female negotiators fall into distinct regions of the current POSAC space. If no \n30 PREDICTION OF OUTCOME IN CRISIS NEGOTIATIONS  \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nsystematic pattern emerges, then the difference, if any, between male and female \nnegotiators is focused on a \u201cthird dimension\u201d of the negotiation process that is not \nencapsulated in the variables studied in the current POSAC. Thus, the question of \nwhether two dimensions are a sufficient representation of the structure of commu -\nnication is an important avenue of replication in future research. Studies may build \non the current framework by exploring additional facets of behavior to determine \nwhether they refine the current interrelations or require an additional independent \ndimension for representation. Also interesting in this regard would be to determine \nwhether comparable structures in communication behavior emerge from dialogue \nin other dyadic and group interactions. Such direct comparisons are possible using \nPOSAC because hypothesis testing is based on the intrinsic structure of the data \nand does not arise from omitting components or imposing an extrinsic statistical \nframework. \nThe conceptualization of behavior along a partially ordered competitive scale \nenabled analysis to simultaneously show that successful and unsuccessful negotia-\ntions may be differentiated in terms of long-term developmental trends in behavior. \nSpecifically, findings indicated that unsuccessful negotiations are characterized by \nthe occurrence of a final trend of increasing competitive behavior across interac-\ntions, whereas incidents associated with successful negotiation showed a gradual \ndecrease in competitive behavior. These trends show that larger, more progressive \npatterns of relational development can emerge from the dynamic local exploration \nof individuals\u2019 concerns (Gulliver, 1979). Indeed, because it was possible to \nsimultaneously examine global trends and local dynamics of behavior, the findings \nlend credence to Donohue and Roberto\u2019s (1996) suggestion that the dominant \nprocess accounts of negotiation are not competing models but rather frameworks \nwhich capture interaction dynamics at different levels of analysis. In the current \nnegotiations, progression over time was satisfactorily represented by several (at \nmost three) long-term trends in behavior, which is a pattern that closely resembles \nthe Stage account (Putnam, 1990). Yet, the distribution of interaction in the \nPOSAC space is dependent on the juxtaposition of Distributive and Integrative \nbehaviors along the two base axes, implying that the Interdependence account is \ncentral to any conceptualization of local level dynamics. In the current framework, \nthis interdependence is structured in the form of a single dimension (i.e., the Lat-\neral axis), but further work is required to define the exact content underlying this \ndimension. \nIndeed, one useful feature of POSAC is the ability to examine sequences of \nbehavior by connecting episodes from a single case in temporal order, whereby \nchanges in behavior are shown as movement across the regions of the solution \nspace. A more detailed examination of this kind may provide insights into the rela-\ntionship between broad trends and local interdependence in generating negotiation \noutcome. However, what it cannot do is give information about the actual topic of \ninteraction, which would require a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the tran-\nscripts. Future work of this kind would do well to focus on the dynamics that cause \na transition in development between increasing Integrative behavior and increasing \nDistributive behavior. \n P. J. TAYLOR 31 \nThe International Journal of Conflict Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 \nConclusions \nOverall, the results of this study provide empirical evidence of the usefulness \nof POSAC for examining the intrinsic structure of differences among episodes of \ncommunication and for classifying negotiation success relative to basic behavioral \ncomponents of interaction. The analysis demonstrated the usefulness of conceptu-\nalizing behavior as having various roles on a single scale of competitiveness, along \nwhich the evolving sequences of interactions can be mapped. These findings not \nonly support the relationships proposed by previous studies, but also emphasize the \nneed for future work to clearly specify the interrelationships among the behavioral \npredictors under investigation. \nReferences \nAbbott, T.
