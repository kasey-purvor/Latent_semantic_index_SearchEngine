Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \n1. Introduction \nMicroring electrodes find use in a wide range of electrochemical applications [1-\n19]. This is primarily because their large perimeter-to-area ratio results in an enhanced \nmaterial flux to the electrode surface, leading to higher current densities and improved \ntemporal resolution in the study of reactions with fast chemical and electrochemical \nkinetics. Based on a ring microelectrode and using the insulator interior to the ring as a \nlight guide, the MORE (Fig. 1) is a photoelectrochemical device capable of delivering \nlight via a fiber optic directly to the region of electrochemical measurement, so allowing \nmicroelectrochemical study of systems with complex photochemistries. As such, it \nexploits the enhanced temporal resolution of microrings in that many photogenerated \nspecies are comparatively short-lived. \n \nFig. 1. Schematic cross section of tip of MORE and home-made light coupling unit. \nDerivation of analytical expressions for the steady state, transport limited current \nto microrings in the dark is a challenging problem because the diffusion equation must \nbe solved subject to mixed boundary conditions (i.e. the flux is specified at one part of a \nsurface and the concentration on another) [20]. The majority of (semi-) analytical \napproaches to solving the dark problem do so for so called \u201cthin rings\u201d ((ring inner \nradius, a)\/(outer radius, b) values > 0.91 [20-23]), assuming a constant flux over the \nelectrode surface. Notable exceptions to this are the work of Philips et al. [24], Tallman \net al. [25-28] and Wu et al. [29-30]. More recently, Compton et al. [13] have used a \nfinite difference numerical method to produce current results for both \n3 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nchronoamperometry and linear sweep voltammetry at microrings of intermediate \nthickness. \nNumerical simulations of the dark behaviour of microrings notwithstanding, in \nmodelling the photocurrent behaviour of the MORE, we have opted for an analytical \napproach as the availability of simple analytical solutions greatly facilitates the analysis \nof experimental data. Following our earlier approach in modelling the photocurrent \nbehavior of semi-transparent optical disc electrodes (ODEs) [31,32], we chose to model \nthe photoelectrochemical response at the MORE of two types of photosystems: (i) a \nsensitiser, S, is photoexcited to form S* (Eq. (1a)) with quantum efficiency \u03c6. This may \nthen either relax back to form S (Eq. (1a)) or be detected at the electrode which, for the \npurposes of this communication, we have shown as an oxidation (a PE process \u2013 \nPhotophysical-Electrochemical): \nsolution:       (1a) SSS 0k*h \u23af\u2192\u23af\u23af\u2192\u23af \u03bd\nelectrode:      (1b) 0\nS\/S\n*\n*E;eSS +\n\u2212+ +\u23af\u2192\u23af\n(ii) photoexcitation of S (Eq. (1a)), which may then either relax back or undergo an \nelectron transfer process with a charge scavenger, A, to form S+ and A- (Eq. (1c)). Either \nS+ or A- may then be detected at the electrode surface; for the purposes of this \ncommunication, we assume the photocurrent is due to reduction of S+, which may itself \nundergo some loss reaction (Eq. (1d)), possibly with A-, to regenerate S (a PCE process - \nPhotophysical Chemical Electrochemical): \nsolution:       (1c) \u2212+ +\u23af\u2192\u23af+ ASA*S 1k\nsolution:        (1d) SS 2k\u23af\u2192\u23af+\nelectrode:      (1e) 0\nS\/S\nE;SeS +\u23af\u2192\u23af+ \u2212+\n4 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nwhere S* is the photoexcited sensitiser, k0 is a pseudo-first order rate constant (s-1) and \nk1 and k2 are second order rate constants (m3 mol-1 s-1). The models developed will be \napplicable to the study of homogeneous and microheterogeneous photosystems (such as \ncolloidal semiconductors) that (i) exhibit electrochemical activity and (ii) are not subject \nto quenching reactions at metal electrode surfaces through double electron transfer \nmechanisms. As such, these models will find use in the areas of e.g. solar energy \nconversion [33-36], pollution abatement [37], non-linear optics [38], photo \nelectroanalysis [39], and the study of photoactive drugs for the treatment of cancer [40]. \nThus, in this paper, we describe a theoretical treatment for the study of PE and \nPCE systems using the MORE. For both systems, we generate approximate expressions \nfor the steady state, diffusion limited photocurrent at the MORE and test those \nexpressions using data from the Ru(bipy)32+\/Fe3+ PCE system. \n2. Experimental \n2.1 Reagents \nAll chemicals were of analytical grade or better and used as received. Distilled \nwater, produced by a home-made still, was further purified by a deionisation system (E \npure model 04642, Barnstead\/Thermodyne, Dubuque, Iowa, USA) to a resistivity of 1.8 \nx 105 \u03a9m.  Prior to electrochemical analysis, all reagent solutions were purged for 15 \nminutes with nitrogen (white spot grade, BOC Ltd., Guildford, Surrey, UK). \n2.2 Electrodes, Equipment and Optical Arrangement \nMORE fabrication and characterisation have been described elsewhere [1,18,19]. \nAll MOREs had gold rings with an internal ring diameter of 250 \u03bcm and a thickness of 5 \nnm. Illumination was provided by a 900 Watt Xe Arc Lamp (Applied Photophysics, UK) \nin conjunction with an f\/3.4 grating monochromator (Applied Photophysics). The output \n5 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nof the monochromator was focussed onto one end of a light guide cable (Applied \nPhotophysics), the other end of which was interfaced with the MORE through a home-\nmade light coupling unit (Fig. 1). \nAll voltammetric measurements were made in a three-electrode arrangement with a \nsaturated calomel electrode (SCE) (EIL, Chertsy, Surrey, UK) as reference and a Pt wire \nas the counter electrode. The potentiostat used was an Autolab PGSTAT10 computer \ncontrolled workstation (Windsor Scientific Ltd., Slough, UK) incorporating a \npreamplifier (model ECD) for low current measurements. In order to minimise electrical \nnoise, the workstation was powered through a mains filter (Bowthorpe PP3, Maplins, \nRayleigh, UK) and all (photo-)electrochemical experiments were conducted with the \nelectrochemical cell placed within a home-made Faraday cage, which also served to \nexclude ambient light during experiments in the dark. All photocurrent signals with a \nsignal-to noise ratio (S\/N) of less than 2 were discarded.

The steady state diffusion \nequation for S* is set up using the following assumptions [31, 32]: \n1.1.  The light makes only a small perturbation to [S] (mol m-3), thus not altering the \ndark current value significantly. This means that the solution does not bleach and I, \nthe flux of light at distance x normal to the electrode surface, is given by \n, where Iph is the flux of light at the electrode surface ((mol \nphotons) m-2 s-1) and  \u03b5\u03bb is the absorption coefficient (m2 mol-1) at wavelength \u03bb. \nx]S[\nph eII \u03bb\n\u03b5\u2212=\n1.2.

(10b). \nWe now move on to discuss the solution of Eqs. (5) when the ring electrode is \nswitched on i.e. S* is consumed at the electrode surface under diffusion control. We \nagain assume that I is invariant with \u03c7 i.e. \u03b3 < 1. Inside the beam, Eq.

Semi analytical solutions to Eqs. (11) and (5b) \nmay be achieved by following an analogous approach to that adopted when the ring is \noff. However, Eq. (5b) must be solved using the discontinuous boundary conditions B7, \nthe resultant solution matching at \u03c1 = \u03c10 producing a set of dual integral equations that \nappear analytically intractable. This difficulty may be circumvented by assuming that \nEq. (11) applies in the range 0 < \u03c1 < \u03c11 rather than 0 < \u03c1 < \u03c10 i.e. that it applies over the \nring, despite the fact that no photogeneration occurs in that space.  \nThis assumption can be defended as follows. Returning to Eqs. (10) and Fig. 3, we \ncan calculate the error produced in the calculated values of the concentration field when \n10 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nEq. (10a) rather than Eq. (10b) is applied to the space defined by \u03c10 < \u03c1 < \u03c11. At a \nmedian value of \u03c10 such as \u03c10 = 2.5 and \u03c11 = 1.1\u03c10 (i.e. the thickest ring that still \nconforms with the definition of a thin ring [21]), use of Eq. (10a) at \u03c10 < \u03c1 < \u03c11 gives \nrise to >10% error in the calculated concentration of the photoexcited species in that \nspace. However, our MOREs have \u03c10\/\u03c11 values > 0.99 i.e. \u03c11 < 1.01\u03c10. When dealing \nwith such very thin rings, the error in the value of [S*] in the space above the ring when \ncalculated using Eq. (10a) instead of (10b) is less than 1.2% if \u03c10 < 10 and 5.1% if \u03c10 < \n20. Fig. 4 shows the percentage error as a function of \u03c10 for a ring where \u03c11 =1.01\u03c10 (i.e. \nthe thickest ring that still conforms with our definition of a very thin ring). Thus, if \u03c10\/\u03c11 \n> 0.99 and \u03c10 < 20, then the concentration field over the ring can be considered as being \ndetermined by Eq. (7a) (electrochemistry off) and Eq.

As in section 3.1, the steady state diffusion equation for S* and S+ \n(the latter being the species that is detected at the electrode surface) are set up using the \nfollowing assumptions 2.1-2.3. These are made in addition to assumptions 1.1-1.3. \n2.1  the loss reaction, Eq. (1d), is pseudo- 1st order with respect to [S+] with rate \ncoefficient k2. \n2.2  A is present in such large excess (a) that [A] is uniform in the vicinity of S\/S* and \nthat the electron transfer reaction (Eq.

Thus A reacts with S* before S* diffuses any significant distance. \n2.3  The electron transfer kinetics of S+ at the electrode are extremely rapid, so the \nphotocurrent is under either mass transport or photochemical kinetic control. \n15 \nF.P.L.

As discussed in relation to Eq. \n17 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \n(29), the reciprocal photocurrent should be proportional to [Fe3+]-1 with a slope\/intercept \nvalue numerically equal to k0\/k1. This in turn corresponds to 1\/KSV, the reciprocal Stern-\nVolmer coefficient for the Fe3+\/Ru(bipy)32+ system [47]. Using the data of Fig. 6, Fig. 7 \nshows that this theoretically predicted dependence is also observed experimentally (R2 = \n0.992), giving k1\/k0 = Ksv = 0.36 m3 mol-1. This is in good agreement with a literature \nvalue of KSV = 0.9 m3 mol-1 [47] and, in conjunction with the linearity of the plot in Fig. \n7, confirms the applicability of our model and the expressions of Eqs. (26)\/(29). \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n[Fe(III)] \/ mol m-3\ni \/\n p\nA\n \nFig. 6.

(26-28) predict that the photocurrent should be linearly proportional to \n[Ru(bipy)32+]. Fig. 8 confirms that this is the case, again supporting the validity of Eqs \n(26-28). Knowing k0\/k1 and all other experimental parameters, it is possible, by use of \nEq. (28), to extract from the slope of Fig. 8 a value of \u03c6\/k23\/4 which, for those data, is \nfound to be equal to 5.81 s3\/4. Provided k2 is known, it is then possible to calculate a \nvalue for the quantum efficiency for the photoexcitation and intersystem crossing of \nRu(bipy)32+*. However, in order to perform this calculation, we must first determine a \nvalue for k2. As mentioned in sections 3.2, k2 may be obtained by measuring the \nphotocurrent as a function of a, the inner radius of the ring. This requires the time \nconsuming fabrication of a range of MOREs with inner radii values spread over at least \ntwo orders of magnitude. However, comparison between this mathematical model for \nPE\/PCE systems at the MORE and our earlier model for the same systems at an ODE \n[31,32] leads us to believe that both k0 and k2 can be more readily obtained for PE and \nPCE systems by simply studying the time-dependence of the light-on photocurrent \ntransients. This will be explored in the next paper in this series. \n19 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \n4. Conclusions \nWe have derived asymptotic analytical expressions for the steady state, transport \nlimited photocurrent generated by PE and PCE systems at MOREs with thin microrings \n(a\/b > 0.99). The expressions were generated by solving the diffusion equation for the \nphotogenerated electroactive species both inside and outside the beam, and matching the \nsolutions at the beam surface. The expressions are used to design experimental protocols \nthat allow for the complete characterization of a system\u2019s kinetics. The MORE, the \nexpressions and the associated protocols will therefore be highly useful in the study of a \nrange of homogeneous and microheterogeneous photoelectrochemical systems. \nThe expressions were tested by using them to interpret the results of a MORE \nstudy of the Ru(bipy)32+\/Fe3+ system. The value of the Stern-Volmer constant for the \nquenching of photoexcited Ru(bipy)32+ by Fe3+ so obtained (0.36 m3 mol-1 ) compares \nfavourably with the value obtained from fluorescence measurements (0.9 m3 mol-1). We \nare currently studying the transient response of PE and PCE systems at the MORE. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for a postgraduate research \nstudentship for F.A. and a period of Sabbatical leave for C.B. We also thank the EM \nFacility at the University of Brighton for help with the manufacture of the MOREs and \nDrs Dave Parker (UCLan) and Ben Horrocks (University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne) for \nhelpful discussions. \nAppendix \nFig. 2 illustrates the geometry of the problem solved in section 3.1. It is assumed \nthat the optical disc is uniformly illuminated by parallel light passing from the disc into \nsolution. An explanation of this assumption and its limitations is given here. \n20 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nThe MORE is most conveniently made by coating a fibre optic with a layer of an \nappropriate conductor [1,18,19], such as gold. The fibre itself consists of a central \ndielectric core of refractive index n1, surrounded by a concentric cladding of a slightly \nlower (by \u22451%) refractive index, n2. The numerical aperture, NA, of the fibre is given by \n( 2\/12221 nnsinNA \u2212=\u03b1= )        (A1) \nwhere \u03b1, which is measured with respect to the central axis of the fibre, is the semi-apex \nangle of the cone shape formed by the divergence of light as it leaves the fibre. Light \nentering the fibre at an angle less than \u03b1 is propagated down the core of the fibre through \ntotal internal reflectance at the core-cladding interface. The model of the light beam \nemerging from the optical disc presented in Fig. 2 therefore appears to be at variance \nwith the physical reality in two ways: \n1. The light emerges not as a parallel beam, but rather as a divergent cone; and \n2. Light is propagated down the core, not the cladding, giving rise at the surface of the \noptical disc to a \u201cdark zone\u201d between the core and the innermost edge of the ring. \nThe latter concern can be dismissed by consideration of the actual construction of the \nMORE, Fig. 1. The length of fibre optic employed is usually no more than 7 cm and is \nheld straight along its entire length. Light may therefore be transmitted through the \ncladding, an expectation confirmed by our earlier study of the electrochemistry of the \nphenothiazinium dye, methylene blue (MB+), wherein the photoexcited triplet state of \nthe dye was detected by direct electrochemical oxidation at the ring of the MORE [1]. \nThe thickness of the cladding of the fibres used in all MORE experiments was 25 \u03bcm. \n3MB+ has a lifetime of 90 \u03bcs[48] and a diffusion coefficient of 8.1 x 10-10 m2 s-1 [49] \u2013 \nthus, the maximum radial distance that 3MB+ might be expected to diffuse after leaving \nthe beam and before relaxation to its ground state is 270 nm. This is ~1% of the \nthickness of supposed \u201cdark zone\u201d between the core and the ring, indicating that a \n21 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nsignificant intensity of light is transmitted through the cladding. This light will be \nattenuated if the fibre is either bent or is significantly longer than the length used in Fig. \n1 and experimentalists should bear this in mind when using their own MOREs. \nThe effect of the former concern can be understood by consideration of the systems \nkinetic length, generically Xk, specifically Xk,0 or Xk,2 (consideration in terms of the \nabsorbance length, X\u03b5, is inappropriate as we assume light is virtually unattenuated as it \npasses through solution i.e. \u03b3 << 1). To a first approximation, only that material \ngenerated within Xk of the surface of the MORE can be detected on the ring. The spread \nof the beam at Xk, given by the ratio of the radius of the beam rB to a is: \n( )NAarcsin(tan\na\nX\n1\na\nr kB += )       (A2) \nCommercially available fibres have NA \u2245 0.1-0.4. In that range, and in non-\ndimensionalised form, \n00\nB NA1 \u03c1+=\u03c1\n\u03c1\n         (A3) \nEqs. (19) & (26) are valid over the range 20 > \u03c10 > 1. In conjunction with the above \nlimits on NA, this gives minimum and maximum divergences of 1.005 or 0.5% and 1.4 \nor 40% respectively. It should be realized that some spread is actually desirable as it \nprovides extra validation for the assumption made in solving Eq. (11) i.e. that Eq. (11) is \nassumed to hold in the space over the ring. However, in order that the assumption of an \ninvariant light intensity at x < Xk should hold (i.e. \u03b3 < 1), it would seem appropriate to \nrestrict use of fibre optic based MOREs to those systems where the divergence is no \nmore than 1.1 or 10% i.e. that NA\/\u03c10 is no more than 0.1. Again, experimentalists should \nbear this restriction in mind when using their own MOREs. \n22 \nF.P.L. Andrieux et al \/ Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry \nFigure Captions \nFig. 1.
