Substantial O3 reductions, arising from \nphotochemical catalysis by reactive chlorine and bromine species on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds, \nhave been recorded over Antarctica, leading to the annual springtime \u2018ozone hole\u2019 (Farman et al. 1985). \nWidespread, but less severe, O3 depletion also occurs over northern and southern midlatitudes and the Arctic \n(Stolarski et al. 1992; M\u00fcller et al. 1997). Since O3 absorbs biologically damaging solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) \nradiation (280-315 nm), reductions in stratospheric O3 lead to increased irradiances of UV-B received at the \nEarth\u2019s surface (World Meteorological Organization 1999). \nConsiderable effort has been invested in determining plant response to simulated O3 depletion during \nthe past two decades. The two main experimental approaches used have been to apply supplemental UV-B \nradiation to plants from fluorescent UV lamps or to filter UV-B from solar radiation, usually with plastic \nscreens. These artificial exposures have suggested that O3 depletion may increase foliar concentrations of UV-B \nscreening pigments, typically flavonoids, but, in many plant species, has a negligible effect on photosynthesis \nand growth (Caldwell & Flint 1994; Searles et al. 2001). However, although these exposures have built up a \ngeneric picture of plant response to elevated UV-B, they are often confounded by methodological problems. For \nexample, the low irradiances of UV-A radiation (315-400 nm) and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation; \n400-700 nm) received by plants in laboratory or glasshouse exposures tend to produce anomolously severe \nresponses to UV-B radiation (Caldwell & Flint 1994). The increasing use of outdoor irradiation systems in \nrecent years has led to less exaggerated effects of elevated UV-B on plant growth. However, in non-modulated \n(or \u2018square wave\u2019) UV-B systems, in which lamps produce a constant supplement of UV-B irrespective of \nambient solar radiation conditions, unrealistically high irradiances of UV-B received by plants during cloudy \nperiods may result in anomolous effects of UV-B on plant growth (Allen et al. 1998). Modulated outdoor UV-B \nexposure systems negate this problem, since plants are irradiated with UV-B radiation from lamps against \nnatural background levels of UV-A and PAR, but recent data indicate that some systems may yield artefactual \nresults owing to plant response to UV-A radiation or some other factor associated with energized lamps \n(Newsham et al. 1996). Filtration experiments suffer from the problem that screens substantially alter several \nother abiotic factors other than incident radiation, notably temperature and precipitation (Kennedy 1995), \nalthough efforts have been made to reduce these problems (e.g. Rousseaux et al. 2001). \n  4 \nExperiments in locations experiencing substantial stratospheric O3 depletion are therefore required to \ndetermine plant response to O3-dependent increases in UV-B radiation. Recent studies on the Antarctic \nPeninsula using screens to filter UV-B from solar radiation have examined plant responses to altered UV-B \nradiation several weeks after treatments have been applied (Day et al. 1999; Ruhland & Day 2000; Xiong & Day \n2001). However, although these studies have examined how Antarctic vegetation responds to medium term \nchanges in incident UV-B, they have not addressed whether plant response is associated with daily variation in \nUV-B radiation associated with O3 depletion or not. Little is known of how plants respond to O3 depletion per \nse: Rousseaux et al. (1999) found a significant association between DNA damage in the foliage of the herb \nGunnera magellanica and increasing UV-B irradiances arising from O3 depletion over Tierra del Fuego, but, \nother than these data, no information exists as to how O3 depletion influences terrestrial plants. In the light of \nthis, we performed a non-manipulative study into the effects of O3 depletion on the pigmentation and \nphotosynthesis of two bryophyte species in late austral spring and early summer on the western Antarctic \nPeninsula, at a location c. 1,500 km south of Tierra del Fuego. Substantial depletion of O3 occurs in the \nstratosphere over the Antarctic Peninsula at this time of year, coinciding with the emergence of plants from \nmelting snow and ice, which results in wide variation in irradiances of solar UV-B received by vegetation. We \nselected bryophytes for study because the majority lack a cuticle, which can strongly absorb UV-B radiation \n(Krauss et al. 1997), and we hence anticipated significant responses to elevated UV-B radiation in these plants. \n \n  5 \nMaterials and methods \nStudy site and sampling \nPlants of the liverwort Cephaloziella varians (Gottsche) Steph. and the moss Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske \nex Nitardy were sampled daily at solar noon (13:30 hrs local time) between 16 November and 28 December \n1998 and between 11 November and 10 December 1999 from a gully fed by meltwater from a permanent \nsnowbank, and situated at c. 5 m above sea level at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, western Antarctic Peninsula \n(67\uf0b0 34' S, 68\uf0b0 07' W; Fig. 1). Plants in the gully were exposed to solar radiation without shading between c. \n10:00 and 19:00 hrs local time during the period of study. Snowfalls during the study were relatively infrequent, \nbut occurred on 16-18, 23, 29 and 30 November 1999, when snow was gently cleared from plants at least 4 h \nbefore sampling. Three separate colonies of each bryophyte (c. 50 \uf0b4 50 mm) were excised with a scalpel and, in \n1998, were immediately taken in clean polythene bags in the dark to a laboratory situated c. 500 m from the \ngully. Measurements of quantum yield of photochemistry were made on colonies before taking them to the \nlaboratory in 1999 (see photochemical yield measurements). \n \nPigment measurements \nOnce at the laboratory, the uppermost 2-3 mm of foliage was cut from each colony and, to facilitate grinding, \nwas blotted on tissue paper until no free water could be drawn from the tissues (Post & Vesk 1992). Preliminary \nanalyses, using the spectrophotometric methods detailed below, indicated that this process removed c. 2% of the \npigments analysed for in this study from plant tissues. Additional subsamples of unblotted material were also \nretained for HPLC analyses in 1999 (see below). Each sample was then divided into three 100 mg subsamples. \nTwo of the subsamples were ground separately with c. 1.5 g of silver sand in a mortar with a pestle for 0.5 min. \nTo extract chlorophylls and carotenoids, 3 mL of methanol was added to the first subsample and the tissues were \nground for 1 min. The extracts were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 0 \uf0b0C and 700 \u00b5L of these \nextracts were passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). To extract UV-B \nscreening pigments, 3 mL of a 70:20:1 mixture of methanol, water and HCl was added to the second subsample \nand the tissues were ground for 1 min. The extracts were heated at 65 \uf0b0C for 10 min and were then centrifuged at \n6000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants removed and placed in a refrigerator at 4 \uf0b0C, and a further 1 mL of the \nmethanol, water and HCl mixture was added to the pellet, which was resuspended before heating again at 65 \uf0b0C \nfor 10 min (Post & Vesk 1992). The supernatants were combined and 700 \u00b5L of the extracts passed through 0.45 \n  6 \n\u00b5m filters. The third subsample was dried to constant mass (60 \uf0b0C for 48 h) and weighed to enable pigment data \nto be expressed on a per unit dry mass basis. \nExtracts were transferred to UV grade polymethyl methacrylate semi-microcuvettes (PMMA; Kartell \nspa, Milan, Italy), diluted and absorbances were measured immediately in a spectrophotometer. To estimate \nconcentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids, absorbances of methanol extracts were measured at \n470, 653 and 666 nm and concentrations were calculated using standard formulae (Lichtenthaler & Wellburn \n1983). Masses of chlorophylls and carotenoids extracted per unit dry mass of tissue were subsequently \ncalculated. To estimate concentrations of UV-B screening pigments, the absorbance of each acidified methanol \nextract was measured between 280 and 315 nm (step 1 nm). Concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were \nexpressed in arbitary units as the area under the absorbance curve (AUC280-315) per unit dry mass of tissue. \nSample preparation and analyses were conducted in dim light and were usually completed within 2 h of \nexcision. Pigment data were not available on 20 November 1998 for Cephaloziella and on 30 November 1998 \nfor both species. \nHPLC analyses were made on a subset of samples to test whether or not bryophytes increased or \ndecreased the synthesis of specific carotenoids in response to O3 depletion. Triplicate samples (each c. 20 mg) of \nboth bryophytes were collected on 3-5 December 1999, when mean O3 column depth was 205 Dobson units \n(DU) and 7-9 December 1999, when mean O3 column depth was 350 DU. Material was immediately frozen at \n-80 \uf0b0C and transported back to the UK for analysis. Samples were freeze-dried (Savant Speed Vac Plus, Savant \nInstruments, Inc., Holbrook, NY, USA), so that pigment concentrations could be calculated relative to sample \ndry mass, and were added to 5 mL of extraction solvent (80:15:5 mixture of acetone, methanol and water). \nSamples were ground with a glass rod and incubated overnight at 7 \uf0b0C in the dark with shaking. The extracts \nwere freeze-dried and 1 mL of injection solvent (70:25:5 mixture of acetone, 0.1 M ammonium acetate and \nmethanol) was immediately added. Samples were shaken for 30 min to dissolve pigments and were passed \nthrough 0.45 \u03bcm filters. Extracts (60 \u03bcL) were diluted 2:1 with ammonium acetate buffer before injection onto a \nWaters Spherisorb ODS-2 column with a particle size of 5 \u03bcm (Alltech Associates, Carnforth, UK). Pigments \nwere separated by reversed phase HPLC at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1. The mobile gradients were solvent A \n(80:20 mixture of methanol and 0.5 M ammonium acetate), solvent B (90:10 mixture of acetonitrile and water) \nand solvent C (ethyl acetate) using the protocol described by Wright et al. (1991). Methanol, acetonitrile and \nethyl acetate HPLC grade reagents were filtered (0.2 \u03bcm) and degassed with nitrogen. Water was purified using \n  7 \na Millipore milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Ammonium acetate was AR grade. Pigment \ndetection was at 435, 470 and 665 nm, with spectra from 300-700 nm being collected continuously by a diode \narray detector (Kontron Instruments Ltd., Watford, UK). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards were \nused to verify the identity of individual pigments using Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research protocols \n(Jeffrey et al. 1997). \nexpressed \n \nPhotochemical yield measurements \nA pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer (MINI-PAM photosynthesis yield analyzer, Heinz-Walz GmbH, \nEffeltrich, Germany) was used to measure minimal chlorophyll a fluorescence (Fo) and maximum fluorescence \n(Fm) induced by a 0.8 s saturating flash on three separate dark-adapted (20 min) colonies of each bryophyte \nspecies at solar noon in 1999. Fv\/Fm, the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry (in which Fv = Fm - Fo), \nwas subsequently calculated (Schreiber et al. 1986). A tent was pitched close to the gully from which bryophytes \nwere sampled with an inner enclosure of rubber-backed cloth in which to dark-adapt plants. \n \nO3 column measurements \nOverpass measurements of O3 column depth (in DU) over Rothera Point were obtained from the Earth Probe \nTotal O3 Mapping Spectrometer (EP-TOMS), situated aboard the NASA Earth Probe Satellite, through the world \nwide web (http:\/\/jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov). Data from the spectrometer were not available between 13 and 28 \nDecember 1998 and for 17 November in both years.  \n \nIrradiance measurements \nGlobal spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm (step 0.5 nm) was recorded by a double monochromator \ngrating spectroradiometer (Bentham DM150; Bentham Instruments Ltd., Reading, UK) situated in a laboratory c. \n500 m from the gully from which bryophytes were sampled. The instrument was calibrated against a 1000 W \nquartz-halogen tungsten coil filament lamp which had been calibrated relative to National Institute of Standards \nand Technology standards. The instrument recorded data every 30 min between 08:00 and 19:00 hrs local time in \n  8 \nboth years and hourly between 20:00 and 07:00 hrs local time in 1999. Data from the spectroradiometer were not \navailable for 25 and 26 November 1998 and for between 19 and 28 December 1998. \nIrradiance data were either expressed either as the irradiance (in W m-2) of unweighted UV-B, UV-A or \nPAR, the irradiance of biologically effective UV-B weighted with the generalized plant action spectrum (UV-\nBBE; Caldwell 1971) normalized at 300 nm, or the ratio of UV-B to PAR irradiance (hereafter FUV-B\/FPAR). Noon \nvalues of each parameter were calculated. Integration was also used to calculate daily doses (in kJ m-2) of UV-\nBBE or of unweighted UV-B, UV-A and PAR from irradiance data. Daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR values were also \ncalculated. PAR and FUV-B\/FPAR values were under- and overestimated, respectively, relative to most other studies, \nbecause irradiances of PAR were recorded up to 600 nm, rather than 700 nm. \n \nAbiotic factor measurements \nAmbient temperature (in \uf0b0C) and relative humidity (%) data were recorded every 5 min in both years by two \nplatinum resistance thermometers (PT100; Labfacility Ltd., Teddington, UK) and a humidity transmitter (Vaisala \nHMD60UO\/YO; Vaisala Inc., Woburn, MA, USA), respectively, under a Stevenson screen situated c. 300 m \nfrom the gully from which bryophytes were sampled. The temperature of each colony was also recorded during \nphotochemical yield measurements on each day in 1999 with a hand-held digital thermometer with a penetration \nprobe (Checktemp HI98501; Hanna Instruments Inc., Woonsocket, RI, USA). \n \nData analyses \nIrradiance data recorded in 1998 and 1999 were combined and linear regression models were used to determine \nresponses of these data to changes in O3 column. Pigment data from both years were also combined and stepwise \nand linear regression models were used to determine the best and other significant predictor variables for \npigments from all calculated irradiance and abiotic variables. The best predictor for Fv\/Fm was also determined \nby stepwise linear regression from irradiance parameters and abiotic factors measured in 1999. To determine if \nthere was any lag time in pigment response to O3 reduction, percentage variance accounted for (r_ \n2) values were \ncalculated for associations between pigment concentrations and O3-dependent irradiance parameters measured \neither at the time of sampling, or at 24 and 48 h prior to sampling of bryophytes. These analyses were made only \non individual pigments that apparently responded to O3 depletion. Daily mean irradiance data were not used in \nthese analyses: noon measurements of those parameters most closely associated with pigment concentrations \n  9 \nwere used instead. One way ANOVA was used to compare the relative concentrations of individual carotenoids \nbetween 3-5 and 7-9 December 1999. Data from the triplicate samples taken each day for HPLC analyses were \npooled prior to analysis. Differences in O3 column depth, irradiance parameters and abiotic factors between 3-5 \nand 7-9 December 1999 were also determined by one way ANOVA. \nMultiple regression models were used to determine the effects on Fv\/Fm of colony temperature, UV-B \nscreening pigments, carotenoids and the irradiance parameter associated with O3 depletion which was most \nconsistently associated with pigment concentrations. Three- and four-term models were used into which \npredictor variables were fitted sequentially. This process enabled the construction of an analysis of variance table \nin which the effects of each variable, and of different sequences of variables, on Fv\/Fm were determined through \nexamination of F-values (Draper & Smith 1998). Temperature was fitted first in all models to remove the effect \nof this variable on Fv\/Fm; subsequent terms (themselves inter-correlated) were fitted in different orders to \nexamine the effects that these had on the relative significance of other predictors. Statistical analyses were \nconducted in the MINITAB 13.1 and GENSTAT 5.4.1 packages. \n \n  10 \nResults \nVariation in O3 column depth, temperature and radiative environment \nData from the EP-TOMS indicated there was wide variation in O3 column depth over Rothera Point during the \nperiod of study (Fig. 1). Maximum and minimum O3 column depths were 370 and 192 DU, recorded on 19 \nNovember 1998 and 4 December 1999. Air temperatures recorded in 1999 were between -1.5 and 1.9 \uf0b0C: colony \ntemperatures were up to 18.5 \uf0b0C higher than these (Fig. 1, inset). Linear regression, using O3 column depth as a \npredictor variable, and the calculated irradiance parameters as responses, indicated that there were no significant \n(P<0.05) associations between O3 column depth and the irradiances or daily doses of UV-A or PAR received at \nground level. However, a strong inverse association between O3 column depth and daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR was \nrecorded (Fig. 2a). Owing to the influence of clouds on the penetration of UV-B radiation to the Earth\u2019s surface, \na weaker, but significant, inverse association between O3 column depth and the daily dose of unweighted UV-B \nradiation was also found (Fig. 2b). There were also inverse associations between O3 column depth and noon FUV-\nB\/FPAR, the daily dose and noon irradiance of UV-BBE, and the noon irradiance of unweighted UV-B (Table 1). \nMinimum, maximum and mean daily doses of UV-BBE were 0.9, 10.3 and 4.1 kJ m\n-2, respectively. \n \nVariation in pigmentation \nRegression analyses indicated that none of the irradiance parameters associated with O3 depletion were \nsignificant predictors for concentrations of chlorophylls a and b or total chlorophyll extracted from tissues of \neither Cephaloziella or Sanionia (regression summary; r_ 2 = 2 - 6%, all P>0.05). However, stepwise linear \nregression indicated that two irradiance parameters which were directly associated with O3 depletion were best \npredictors for concentrations of UV-B screening pigments and total carotenoids extracted from bryophyte \ntissues. The best predictor for concentrations of UV-B screening pigments in Cephaloziella was daily UV-B \ndose (Fig. 3a). Significant associations were also recorded between concentrations of UV-B screening pigments \nin Cephaloziella tissues and each of the other five irradiance parameters associated with O3 depletion (Table 2). \nThe best predictor for UV-B screening pigments in Sanionia was daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR (Fig. 3b). Noon FUV-B\/FPAR \nand daily dose and noon irradiance of UV-BBE were also associated with concentrations of UV-B screening \npigments in this species (Table 2). The best predictor for concentrations of carotenoids in both bryophyte species \nwas daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR (Fig. 4a, b). Noon FUV-B\/FPAR was also significantly associated with carotenoid \nconcentrations in Cephaloziella tissues. The ratio of UV-BBE to PAR irradiance was not a better predictor for \n  11 \npigment concentrations than daily UV-B dose and FUV-B\/FPAR (data not shown).  \nThe lag time in the accumulation of pigments in response to O3 depletion appeared to be < 24 h: the \nhighest r_ 2 values for associations between pigment concentrations and O3-dependent irradiance parameters were \nrecorded when pigment concentrations were compared with irradiance data measured at the time of sampling. \nRelative to associations between pigment concentrations and irradiance parameters recorded at the time of \nsampling, there were 46% and 70% reductions in r_ 2 values as concentrations of UV-B screening pigments in \nCephaloziella were compared with noon irradiance of UV-B measured 24 and 48 h prior to sampling (Fig. 5a). \nFor carotenoids in Cephaloziella, 50% and 67% reductions in r_ 2 values occurred as pigment concentrations \nwere compared with FUV-B\/FPAR measured 24 and 48 h before sampling, respectively (Fig. 5b), and in Sanionia, \nthere were 19% and 31% reductions in r_ 2 values as UV-B screening pigment concentrations were compared \nwith FUV-B\/FPAR recorded 24 and 48 h prior to sampling (Fig. 5c). It was not possible to determine the lag time in \nthe response of carotenoids in Sanionia because concentrations of these pigments in this species were only \nsignificantly associated with daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR (Table 2). \nOne way ANOVA indicated a significant 41% decrease in daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR between 3-5 and 7-9 \nDecember 1999 (0.0070 v. 0.0041, respectively, F1,5 = 103.0, P<0.001). Noon FUV-B\/FPAR also showed a similar \n40% decrease between these two time periods (F1,5 = 86.4, P<0.001). No other significant differences in any \nother irradiance parameters or abiotic factors were recorded between 3-5 and 7-9 December 1999. HPLC \nanalyses of individual carotenoids indicated that there were significant differences in the relative concentrations \nof individual carotenoids in Cephaloziella and Sanionia tissues between 3-5 and 7-9 December. The relative \nconcentration of neoxanthin increased in tissues of both species in apparent response to O3 depletion, whilst in \nCephaloziella, violaxanthin concentration increased and both lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations decreased \n(Table 3). In Sanionia, the concentration of \u03b2,\u03b2-carotene increased substantially under depleted O3 column \n(Table 3). Relative concentrations of antheraxanthin, and carotenoids not extracted from tissues of both \nCephaloziella or Sanionia (\u03b1- and \u03b2,\u03b5-carotene and their derivatives, canthaxanthin and one unidentified \ncarotenoid) did not apparently respond to O3 depletion. \n \nVariation in photochemical yield \nMinimum Fv\/Fm values (\u00b1 SD) recorded were 0.105 (\u00b1 0.020) and 0.210 (\u00b1 0.015) for Cephaloziella and \nSanionia, respectively, both of which were measured on 11 November 1999. Maximum Fv\/Fm values for \n  12 \nCephaloziella and Sanionia were 0.673 (\u00b1 0.026) and 0.674 (\u00b1 0.013), recorded on 6 and 9 December 1999, \nrespectively. Univariate linear regression models indicated that there were no direct associations between Fv\/Fm \nand O3-dependent irradiance parameters in either Cephaloziella or Sanionia (regression summary; r_ \n2 = 0.4 - \n12%, all P>0.05). Stepwise linear regression analyses indicated that colony temperature was the best predictor \nfor Fv\/Fm in both species and that it accounted for 62% and 59% of the variance in Fv\/Fm of Cephaloziella and \nSanionia, respectively (both P<0.001).   \nMultiple regression models similarly indicated a strong effect of colony temperature on Fv\/Fm  (Table \n4). When FUV-B\/FPAR was entered into three-term multiple regression models along with temperature and \nconcentrations of UV-B screening pigments, 76.5% and 65.8% of the variances in Fv\/Fm of Cephaloziella and \nSanionia were accounted for, respectively. Although univariate analyses showed no effect of FUV-B\/FPAR on Fv\/Fm, \nin both species, FUV-B\/FPAR was inversely correlated with Fv\/Fm in multiple regression models. When FUV-B\/FPAR was \nfitted before UV-B screening pigments in three-term models, we found significant (P<0.01) effects of both \nvariables on Fv\/Fm. However, when UV-B screening pigments were fitted before FUV-B\/FPAR, there were highly \nsignificant positive effects of the pigments on Fv\/Fm, which removed the significant influence of FUV-B\/FPAR on \nFv\/Fm in both species (Table 4). \nWhen carotenoid concentration (estimated by spectrophotometric analyses) was entered into four-term \nmodels along with colony temperature, UV-B screening pigments and FUV-B\/FPAR, 76.6% and 67.1% of the \nvariances in Fv\/Fm of Cephaloziella and Sanionia were accounted for, respectively. Carotenoids did not explain a \nsignificant amount of variation in Fv\/Fm of Cephaloziella when fitted before or after either FUV-B\/FPAR or UV-B \nscreening pigments (Table 4). However, in Sanionia, carotenoids explained a significant amount of variation in \nFv\/Fm only when fitted before UV-B screening pigments (Table 4). In common with the results from the three-\nterm models, when FUV-B\/FPAR was entered before UV-B screening pigments, significant effects of both variables \non Fv\/Fm were found, but when the order in which these two variables were fitted was reversed, significant \neffects of UV-B screening pigments remained, which removed the significant effect of FUV-B\/FPAR on Fv\/Fm in \nboth species. Moreover, for Sanionia, when carotenoids were fitted before UV-B screening pigments and FUV-\nB\/FPAR, there were highly significant positive effects of both pigments on Fv\/Fm, which removed the significant \ninfluence of FUV-B\/FPAR on Fv\/Fm (Table 4). \n  13 \nDiscussion \nThis study took place in an environment with no local pollution sources and hence no tropospheric O3 pollution. \nAll variation in O3 column depth over the study site can hence be assumed to have taken place in the stratosphere \nas a result of photochemical catalysis of the gas by chlorine and bromine species. Our study therefore suggests \nthat Cephaloziella and Sanionia responded rapidly to changes in the spectral environment arising from \nstratospheric O3 depletion by increasing the synthesis of UV-B screening pigments and carotenoids in foliage. \nWe are unaware of any other studies in the literature that have demonstrated significant associations between \nchanges in the spectral environment consequent on stratospheric O3 depletion and the pigmentation of terrestrial \nplants.  \nOur analyses suggested that the time taken for pigments to respond to O3 depletion was < 24 h. That \nAntarctic bryophytes apparently respond rapidly to O3 depletion is perhaps surprising, given the temperature-\ndependence of reactions in metabolic pathways, but the temperatures of bryophyte colonies in our study reached \n20 \uf0b0C on cloudless days, which would have enabled rapid response to O3 depletion. At present it is unclear at \nwhat rate UV-B screening pigments are synthesized and decomposed in plant tissues in the natural environment: \nlaboratory studies on temperate plant species under low PAR irradiances indicate that the synthesis of UV-B \nscreening pigments is induced within several hours of exposure to UV-B radiation (Jordan et al. 1994), owing to \nthe induction of genes encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway \n(Hahlbrock & Scheel 1989). Similarly, a field study on the alpine fern Cryptogramma crispa indicated that UV-\nB screening pigments are synthesized within 12 h of exposure to full sunlight, relative to plants under UV-B \nabsorbing screens (Veit et al. 1996). However, laboratory studies on excised hypocotyls of crop plants indicate \nthat flavonoids do not undergo rapid decomposition (Margna & Vainj\u00e4rv 1981) and glasshouse experiments \nindicate that concentrations of flavonoid glycosides and aglycones in Betula pendula tissues may also take \nseveral days to respond to UV-B radiation, although those of condensed tannins may respond within 24 h \n(Lavola et al. 2000). \nIn a comprehensive review of plant responses to elevated UV-B radiation, Searles et al. (2001), using a \nmeta-analysis of data from 62 outdoor irradiation experiments, concluded that the accumulation of UV-B \nscreening pigments in foliage was the most consistent response of plants to elevated UV-B. Our data confirm \nthat this response can be demonstrated in situ. Field-based experiments in Antarctica have similarly shown \nchanges in UV-B screening pigments in response to altered UV-B radiation: Ruhland & Day (2000) found that \n  14 \nexposure of the pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis to near-ambient solar UV-B radiation for four months at \nStepping Stones Island (64\uf0b0 S) on the western Antarctic Peninsula led to increased concentrations of UV-B \nscreening pigments in foliage, compared with plants exposed to reduced UV-B radiation. Foliage of C. quitensis \nand the grass Deschampsia antarctica also accumulated higher concentrations of UV-B screening pigments after \ntwo months of exposure to near-ambient UV-B radiation than plants exposed to reduced UV-B at a location \nclose to Stepping Stones Island (Xiong & Day 2001). In addition, increased synthesis of UV-B screening \npigments in response to O3 depletion in tissues of the moss Andreaea regularis have also been recorded at \nRothera Point during late austral spring and early summer 1998 (K. Newsham, unpubl.).  \nAlthough Searles et al. (2001) found no effect of elevated UV-B radiation on concentrations of \ncarotenoids, in our study, we found loose, but significant, associations between FUV-B\/FPAR and carotenoid \nconcentrations in both bryophytes. Increased concentrations of carotenoids have also been shown to be present in \nthe foliage of C. quitensis and D. antarctica exposed to near-ambient UV-B radiation compared to foliage of \nplants exposed to reduced UV-B by Xiong & Day (2001). Increased synthesis of carotenoids in A. regularis \ntissues has also been recorded in response to O3 depletion over Rothera Point (K. Newsham, unpubl.). Similarly, \ncarotenoid concentrations in Southern Ocean phytoplankton increase during periods of O3 depletion (Smith et al. \n1992), and empirical studies in artificial systems have also shown that exposure of plants to elevated UV-B \nradiation increases carotenoid concentrations in foliage (e.g. Middleton & Teramura 1993). In contrast, Gehrke \n(1998; 1999), using fluorescent UV lamps in sub-Arctic heaths and bogs, showed that exposure to UV-B \nradiation simulating a 15% depletion of ozone decreased concentrations of carotenoids in tissues of Sphagnum \nfuscum and Polytrichum commune. \nIn addition to recording increased total carotenoid concentrations in bryophyte tissues in response to O3 \ndepletion, our study suggested that changes in FUV-B\/FPAR associated with O3 column depth also influenced the \nrelative concentrations of specific carotenoids. An increase in neoxanthin concentration was the only response \nobserved in both bryophyte species to O3 depletion. Other responses differed between the two bryophyte species: \ntwo xanthophyll cycle pigments, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively increased and decreased in \nCephaloziella tissues during a period of O3 depletion. Although the diurnal synthesis of xanthophyll cycle \npigments is well known to be associated with PAR levels (Demmig-Adams & Adams 1996), the influence of \nUV-B radiation on these carotenoids is less well documented. However, reduced zeaxanthin concentration in \nresponse to elevated UV-B has been demonstrated in the Antarctic alga Leptosomia simplex under controlled \n  15 \nconditions (Dohler 1998). We also recorded decreased lutein concentrations in Cephaloziella under depleted O3 \ncolumn, which is also corroborated by Dohler (1998), who found reduced concentrations of this carotenoid in L. \nsimplex tissues exposed to elevated UV-B. The substantial increase in the concentration of \u03b2,\u03b2-carotene in \nSanionia tissues observed in our study is also corroborated by the observations of Underwood et al. (1999), who \nfound increased concentrations of this carotenoid in a diatom mat exposed to elevated UV-B radiation. \nAlthough we recorded an association between concentrations of UV-B screening pigments in tissues of \nCephaloziella and daily unweighted UV-B dose, consistent associations were found between pigment \nconcentrations and FUV-B\/FPAR. These findings confirm the view expressed by other authors that the relative \nirradiance of UV-B to PAR is an important determinant of plant response to simulated O3 depletion in artificial \nirradiation systems (Middleton & Teramura 1993; Caldwell & Flint 1994; Allen et al. 1998). However, with the \nexception of the study by Caldwell et al. (1994), there are few data to support the argument that relative \nirradiance of UV-B to PAR directly influences plant response in the field. Caldwell et al. (1994) found that the \ngrowth of Glycine max responded most severely to elevated UV-B simulating a 36% reduction in O3 column \nonly when UV-A and PAR were reduced to 50% of their fluxes in solar radiation. Our data, which show \nincreased synthesis of UV-B screening pigments in Sanionia as FUV-B\/FPAR increased, corroborate the data of \nCaldwell et al. (1994), who found the highest concentrations of UV-B screening pigments extracted per unit of \nG. max leaf mass in plants exposed to elevated UV-B radiation and reduced UV-A and PAR. \nNo direct associations between any of the irradiance parameters associated with O3 depletion and Fv\/Fm \nof either bryophyte species were recorded in our study. This corroborates data from Searles et al. (2001), and \nother studies in artificial irradiation systems (Caldwell & Flint 1994), that have shown elevated UV-B to have no \ninfluence on this parameter. These data suggest that the primary production of these two bryophyte species is \nunaffected by O3 depletion, and corroborate the view expressed by other authors that O3 reduction does not \ninfluence the photosynthetic competence of plants (Fiscus & Booker 1995; Allen et al. 1998). The lack of \nassociation between O3-dependent irradiance parameters and chlorophyll concentrations in both bryophytes \ncorroborates data from many other plant species in outdoor irradiation systems (Searles et al. 2001) and \nAntarctic field studies (Day et al. 1999; Xiong & Day 2001), and further supports the argument that the primary \nproduction of Cephaloziella and Sanionia is unaffected by stratospheric O3 depletion.  \nAlthough we could find no direct associations between O3-dependent irradiance parameters and Fv\/Fm, \nwe found a strong positive effect of colony temperature on Fv\/Fm, confirming previous observations that this \n  16 \nparameter is sensitive to low temperatures (Bolh\u00e0r-Nordenkampf & \u00d6quist 1993). Once the influence of \ntemperature on Fv\/Fm was removed, we found that fitting UV-B screening pigments before FUV-B\/FPAR removed \nthe significant negative influence of the latter variable on Fv\/Fm. This analysis implied that UV-B screening \npigments had a protective effect on Fv\/Fm and that the paucity of effect of FUV-B\/FPAR on the photochemical yield \nof Cephaloziella and Sanionia was owing to increased synthesis of UV-B screening pigments. Furthermore, \nfitting carotenoids before UV-B screening pigments and FUV-B\/FPAR in Sanionia, the species with the lowest \nconcentrations of UV-B screening pigments, again removed the negative influence of FUV-B\/FPAR on Fv\/Fm. These \nanalyses suggested a weak, but significant, protective influence of carotenoids on photosynthesis during periods \nof O3 depletion in this species and corroborate the view that carotenoids have a subsidiary role to UV-B \nscreening pigments in protecting plants from UV-B radiation (Cockell & Knowland 1999). Previous studies \nunder controlled conditions have similarly concluded that UV-B screening pigments and carotenoids may protect \nthe photosynthesis and growth of plants from elevated UV-B. For example, Li et al. (1993), using a mutant of \nArabidopsis thaliana with an impaired ability to synthesize flavonoids, showed significant reductions in the dry \nmass accumulation of mutant plants exposed to elevated UV-B radiation, compared with wild type plants. \nSimilarly, the growth of carotenoid deficient mutants of Glycine max has been shown to be reduced by elevated \nUV-B radiation, relative to wild type plants (Middleton & Teramura 1993). Flavonoid deficient mutants of \nHordeum vulgare, containing only 7% of total extractable flavonoids in primary leaves compared with the \nmother variety, also showed significant reductions in Fv\/Fm when exposed to elevated UV-B in growth chambers \n(Reuber et al. 1996). A different approach was used by Reuber et al. (1993), who treated Secale cereale with an \ninhibitor of phenylalanine ammonium lyase to reduce flavonoid production. Plants treated with the inhibitor \nexhibited reduced Fv\/Fm when compared with control plants with normal levels of flavonoids after exposure to \nelevated UV-B radiation under controlled conditions. \nIn conclusion, the data presented here indicate that changes to the radiative environment associated with \nstratospheric O3 depletion elicit responses in the pigmentation of terrestrial plants. They suggest that two \nAntarctic bryophytes responded rapidly to O3-dependent increases in solar UV-B by synthesizing UV-B \nscreening pigments and carotenoids in tissues, and that pigmentation may have conferred protection from \npotentially deleterious effects of UV-B radiation on photochemical yield, even during periods of intense O3 \ndepletion. Future research is required to determine whether or not similar responses occur in other plant species, \nand to address the potential physiological costs to plants of synthesizing and maintaining photoprotective \n  17 \ncompounds in foliage. \n \n  18 \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was funded by the United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council.
