We tested D.F.\u201fs object-based attention in two ways. In the first \nexperiment, we used a spatial cueing procedure to compare the costs associated with shifting \nattention within versus between two separate outline figures. D.F. did not show the normal \nadvantage of within-object over between-object attention shifts. In the second experiment, we \nused a complementary paradigm in which two separate stimuli, presented either on the same or \non different objects, have to be identified as the same or different, We found no evidence for the \nnormal pattern of superior performance for within versus between figure comparisons. In a third \nexperiment, we checked that D.F. showed normal shift costs for invalid as opposed to valid \ncueing in a standard Posner spatial attention task. In a final experiment, we compared horizontal \nversus vertical attention shifting in group of healthy controls without the presence of outline \nrectangles, and found that their pattern of shift costs was indistinguishable from that seen in D.F. \nwhen the rectangles were present (Experiment 1). We conclude that whilst D.F. has a normal \nspatial orienting system this is completely uninfluenced by object structure, we suggest that area \nLO may mediate form processing precisely at the stage where visual representations normally \ninfluence the spread of attention.  \n \n \n1. Introduction \nUngerleider and Mishkin (1982) first proposed that the cortical processing of visual \ninformation was divided into two functionally and anatomically distinct streams. Within their \ninterpretive framework the extraction and representation of objects was viewed as the preserve of \nthe ventral stream. It is now clear from both primate and human research, however, that shape \nselectivity is a feature of both the dorsal and ventral streams (Milner & Goodale, 1995, 2008). \nThese two forms of shape encoding are not mere replicas of each other but show distinct patterns \nof selectivity and generalization (James et al., 2002; Lehky and Sereno, 2007). Furthermore \nMilner and Goodale (1995) have argued that the shape representations in each stream differ not \nonly in their nature, but more importantly in their function. Shape representations in the ventral \nstream are used to inform perception, while shape representations in the dorsal stream are used to \nguide actions. \n Visual form, however, not only drives recognition and action but also influences the \nallocation of attention: it is easier to shift attention within a single object form than between two \nseparate forms (Duncan, 1984; Egly, Driver & Rafal, 1994). This influence is thought to play a \nrole in fine tuning the construction of perceptual representations, by focusing visual processing \non those elements of a scene that group together (Driver, Davis, Russell, Turatto & Freeman \n2001). It is unclear whether the same or similar influences of visual structure might also operate \non attentional selection within the shape representations that guide manual actions to those \nobjects. In terms of Milner and Goodale\u201fs (1995, 2008) two visual-systems framework, we \nwould predict that the classical perceptual \u201cobject-based\u201d attention effects would be mediated \nwithin the ventral stream, and therefore not play a direct role in guiding manual actions. The well \nstudied patient D.F. has a bilateral brain lesion that is centred on ventral-stream area LO, which \nis known through neuroimaging research to play a crucial role in shape perception (Kourtzi & \nKanwisher, 2001; James, Culham, Humphrey, Milner, & Goodale, 2003). D.F. therefore \nprovides a strong test of the potential role of area LO not just in perception, but also in object-\nbased attention. D.F. is, however, clearly able to segregate candidate objects for manual action, \nand to use that visual information to calibrate her movements towards such objects. Thus if \nobject-based attention operates not only within the perceptual domain, but also during the \nprocessing of candidate objects for action, it should be intact in D.F., at least within the dorsal \nstream. An absence of classical perceptual object-based attention effects in D.F. would suggest \nthat this influence of visual structure upon attention is either not important for guiding manual \nactions towards visual objects, or that it is organized quite separately within the two visual \nstreams.  \n DF\u201fs impairment in shape perception may also be informative in terms of the debate \nwithin the object-based attention literature regarding the level in the ventral stream at which \nvisual structure influences attention. At present, although the ability of visual structure to \ninfluence attention is uncontroversial (Scholl, 2001), it is still unclear at exactly what level of \nrepresentation object shape exerts its influence on attention. Indeed Driver and colleagues (2001) \nhave persuasively argued that referring to the influence of visual structure upon attention as \n\u201cobject-based\u201d is strictly inappropriate (though we will continue to use this questionable \nnomenclature within the present paper). They argue that it is not objects, in the sense of the \nvisual units that provide the mental furniture for visual recognition and visual cognition, that \ninfluence our allocation of attention. Rather, they argue, attention interacts with earlier visual \ninformation at the stage of scene segmentation, thereby serving to structure the visual input to \nenable genuine object representations to be extracted later in the system. \n Early segmentation mechanisms and later object representations certainly appear to have \nquite different neural bases: there is evidence that edge extraction and figure-ground assignment \ntake place in the primary visual cortex (Lamme, 1995), whereas shape as a property of objects is \nassociated with activity in the lateral occipital cortex (Malach et al., 1995; Kourtzi & Kanwisher, \n2001). The neural basis of object-based attention, however, still remains unclear. For example \nwhilst M\u00fcller and Kleinschmidt (2003) have provided neuroimaging evidence that the enhanced \nactivation of locations within objects manifests itself within the primary visual cortex, they \naccept that this could well reflect feedback from higher ventral- or dorsal-stream areas. Evidence \nsupporting the putative role of the lateral occipital area (LO) comes from a recent study by \nMartinez and colleagues (2006), who investigated object-based attention using a combination of \nEEG and fMRI. They found that object-based attention was clearly associated with the \nenhancement of the N1 component of the ERP waveform. They go on to argue that this \ncomponent principally reflects activation in the lateral occipital complex, while noting that other \nareas too can contribute to the N1 component (Di Russo, Martinez & Hillyard, 2003). \n The distinction drawn by Driver et al. between early scene-parsing mechanisms and later \nobject-based processing can also be examined at a behavioural level. Again, however, the picture \nremains as yet unclear. On the one hand object-based attention can be demonstrated when \nattention simply has to move across some horizontal lines (Avrahami, 1999), suggesting that \nsuch simple segmentation cues are able to modulate attention. On the other hand, several \nresearchers have demonstrated that the influence of visual structure upon attention is modulated \nby high-level factors such as the perceptual interpretation of the nature of the shape (Chen 1998) \nand previous perceptual experience of that shape (Zemel, Behrmann, Mozer & Bavelier, 2002). \n The present study seeks to shed light on this issue by examining object-based attention in \npatient D.F. Her pattern of impairment, both in terms of its neural locus and its manifestation as \nvisual form agnosia, provides a strong test for the level at which visual structure influences \nattention. DF\u201fs lesion has resulted in a complete bilateral disruption of processing in area LO \nwhilst leaving functionally intact processing in the primary visual cortex, which plays a pivotal \nrole in feeding information to her largely-intact dorsal stream to guide manual actions (James et \nal., 2003). Despite her severe impairment in visual form perception (Milner et al., 1991) D.F. is \nstill able to perform basic scene segmentation tasks. For example, if asked to count the number \nof disks in a display DF is able to segment these from their background and report with near-\nperfect accuracy (Carey, Dijkerman, Murphy, Goodale, & Milner, 2006). By examining the \nnature of object-based attention effects in D.F. we can therefore test the level at which visual \nstructure in the ventral stream influences attention. We have done this by using two \ncomplementary experimental paradigms. In the Experiment 1, we used the paradigm of Egly, \nDriver and Rafal (1994), in which a Posner-style spatial cueing procedure is used to compare \nattention shifting made either within or between two separate outline figures. Despite the similar \ndistance over which attention has to shift from an invalid cue in either case, healthy subjects \nshow a reliable reaction-time advantage of within-object over between-object attention shifts. In \nthe second experiment, we used the complementary paradigm of Marino and Scholl (2005), in \nwhich two stimulus elements have to be compared either within the same outline figure or \nbetween two separate figures. Healthy subjects are facilitated in making same\/different \njudgements for targets that fall within the same figure. \n \n2. Participants \n DF was aged 53 at the time of testing. Her clinical background has been described in detail \nelsewhere (Milner, et al. 1991; Goodale & Milner, 2004) and MRI scans of her lesions have been \npresented by James et al. (2003). Experiments 1, 2 and 3 additionally used eight age-matched \ncontrol subjects (mean age = 51; SD= 4, for experiments 1 and 2, mean age = 52: SD = 4 for \nexperiment 3). Experiment 4 used 6 healthy control subjects (mean age = 30; SD= 8). All control \nsubjects had normal or corrected to normal vision and were students or staff at Durham \nUniversity. \n \n3. Experiment 1 \n3.1. Methods \n Experiment 1 used an adaptation of the cueing paradigm devised by Egly and colleagues \n(1994). Participants were presented with two white outline rectangles subtending 17 deg by 3.6 \ndeg of visual angle oriented vertically 6.5 degrees either side of the centre of the screen. The \nrectangles had a white outline, 8 pixels thick, presented on a black background. This outline \ndisplay was present throughout each experimental session. At the start of a trial one of four \npossible target locations at the end of one of the rectangles would be cued with a bright grey \nsquare that would appear for 200ms (see Figure 1, top right). The participant was then presented \nwith a red or green target of similar size, which they were asked to discriminate by pressing one \nof two buttons as quickly and accurately as possible, using the left index finger for one button \nand the right index finger for the other. The target could appear in one of three locations relative \nto the cue: either in the identical location (valid cue trial), at the other location on the same object \n(invalid within-object trial), or at the homologous location on the other rectangle (invalid \nbetween-object trial). These three trial types are illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom three panels). \nThere was 1500ms inter-trial interval during which only the two rectangles remained present on \nthe screen. Participants were tested in 6 blocks of 96 trials. Fifty percent of the trials were validly \ncued, 25% were invalidly-cued within-object and 25% invalidly cued between-objects. The order \nof trial types was randomly counterbalanced within each block. Trials with inaccurate responses \nand those with reaction times likely to be anticipations (less than 150ms) or mis-keyings (more \nthan 1500ms) were removed prior to analysis. Any remaining outliers (responses that were two \nstandard deviations above or below the mean for each subject in each condition) were also \nremoved. This procedure removed 6% of trials as outliers. \n \nFig 1 - Experiment 1. \n- Illustrative stimuli for the object-based cueing paradigm. The targets (cross hatched) were \ngreen or red, the outline rectangles were white on a black background.  \n The stimuli in Experiments 1, 2 and 4 were displayed on an Eizo F55 17-inch (600 x 800 \npixels) colour monitor, driven by a Cambridge Research Systems VSG 2\/5 graphics system at \n100 Hz. Responses in all experiments were recorded using a Cambridge Research Systems CT3 \nbutton-box.  \n \n3.2. Results \n Here and throughout the paper, all statistics are reported as two-tailed. The control group \nclearly demonstrated the object-based attention effect reported by Egly et al. (1994), in that \ninvalidly cued targets appearing on a different object took longer to recognize than invalidly \ncued targets appearing on the same object [t(7) = 2.35, p = 0.051, within object mean RT 468 ms, \nbetween object mean RT 483 ms]. D.F., however, showed a quite different pattern of \nperformance. While she was faster to respond to validly cued than to invalidly cued targets \n(t(498)=7.993, p<0.001), she did not show the normal advantage for within-object invalid trials \nover between-object invalid trials [valid mean RT 726 ms, invalid within-object mean RT 882 \nms, invalid between-object RT 839 ms]. \n  \nFig 2 - Experiment 1. \n- Reaction times (ms) for target discriminations across the three cueing conditions for a healthy \ncontrol group and for patient D.F... Note the y axis uses a different intercept for D.F. and the \ncontrol sample. \n \n \nIt is quite apparent that D.F.\u201fs performance is in general slower than that of controls. However, \nwhat is most critical in interpreting our studies is determining whether the difference in D.F.\u201fs \nreaction times across within- and between-objects conditions is what one might expect of a \nnormal observer or whether her behaviour differs significantly from that of our control sample. It \nis common to treat the means and variances of data obtained from control samples as if they \nwere population parameters rather than sample statistics. Doing so when comparing difference \nscores with relatively small control sample sizes of the order we use here can lead to highly \ninflated Type-I error rates (see e.g. Crawford & Garthwaite, 2005). We have therefore adopted \nan approach suggested by Crawford & Garthwaite (2002, 2007) in which the mean and variance \nof the scores obtained from the control sample are treated correctly as statistics in the course of \nassessing the likelihood that the patient\u201fs scores were drawn from the same population as control \nsample\u201fs. We have used Crawford & Garthwaite\u201fs (2007) Bayesian calculation for within subject \ncontrol scores as this allows us to preserve raw, unstandardised, reaction-time measures in our \ncalculations.  \n Comparing D.F.\u201fs difference score (between-object invalid vs within-object invalid RTs) \nwith those of the sample indicates that D.F.\u201fs RT difference lies at the extreme of normal \nobservers\u201f performance. The Bayesian estimate of the percentage of the control population \nestimated to show a more extreme RT difference is 2% (i.e. p=0.02). Accuracy was near ceiling \nfor the control subjects in both between and within object trials and these did not differ \nstatistically [t(7)=1.37, p=0.21]. D.F. has good colour discrimination (Milner & Heywood 1989) \nand indeed responded correctly on every trial. Her accuracy did not differ from that of the \ncontrols on Crawford and Garthwaite\u201fs test [p=0.66]. \n \n3.3. Interim discussion \n According to our use of a variation of Egly et al.\u201fs (1995) paradigm it is clear that D.F. \ndid not show the normal influence of objects upon attention. If anything, she showed an apparent \nreversal of the normal trend. It is possible, however, that this trend merely reflects the differential \ndifficulty of making a vertical as opposed to a horizontal shift within this task, since we did not \nbalance our experimental design to rule out this possibility. We examined this interpretation in \nExperiment 4. But first we sought in Experiment 2 to establish whether the absence of an object-\nbased attention effect in D.F. could be replicated using a quite different experimental paradigm.  \n \n4. Experiment 2 \n4.1. Methods \n Experiment 2 employed a modified version of the two-item comparison paradigm \nemployed by Marino and Scholl (2005), in which participants are asked to report whether two \nitems, either located on the same object or on two different objects, are the same or different. The \ndisplay in this experiment contained the same pair of rectangles as used in Experiment 1, which \nagain formed the background that was present throughout each experimental session. On each \ntrial the participant was presented with two square patches of colour (equi-frequently red or \ngreen), which could either occupy opposite ends of the same rectangle, or homologous ends of \nthe two different rectangles.  \n  \nFig. 3 \u2013 Experiment 2  \n- Illustrative stimuli used in the object-based two-item comparison paradigm (Experiment 2). \nThe targets were red (shown as cross-hatched) or green (shown as dashed). The outline \nrectangles were white on a black background.  \n \nThe subject\u201fs task was to report whether the colours were the same or different using one of two \nbuttons, again using the left index finger for one button and the right index finger for the other. \nThe targets remained present on the screen until a response was made. There was a 1700ms \ninter-trial interval during which the rectangles remained visible. Each participant completed 6 \nblocks of 96 trials. Each block contained equal numbers of same and different pairings and of \nwithin- and between-object trials. The presentation order was randomly counterbalanced within \neach block. Reaction times were trimmed for outliers and errors in the manner described in \nExperiment 1. This procedure removed 10% of trials as outliers. \n \n4.2. Results \n The control subjects took reliably longer to make discriminative responses when the \ntargets were both located on different objects than when they were on the same object [t(7) = 3.7, \np <0.01; within-object mean RT 499 ms, between-object mean RT 511 ms]\n1\n. Thus their results \nwere clearly consistent with the operation of object-based attention in this paradigm. Again \nD.F.\u201fs results showed a quite different pattern. She not only showed no cost for between-, as \nopposed to within-, object comparisons, but in fact took longer to make within object \ncomparisons [D.F. within object RT 1287, between object RT 1224]. Crucially, Crawford and \nGarthwaite\u201fs (2007) Bayesian inferential test showed that D.F.\u201fs mean difference score (within-\nobject minus between-object) differed significantly from that of the controls [p<0.001].  \n                                                 \n1\n The first block of 96 trials for one of the control participants had to be removed because performance fell below \n50% (i.e. below chance) in one of the conditions, suggesting that they had not learnt the correct key responses. \n Fig. 4 \u2013 Experiment 2  \n- Data for a healthy control group and for patient D.F.. Reaction times (ms) for same\/different \ncomparisons for pairs of stimuli appearing within the same object or between the two objects. \nNote the y axis uses a different intercept for D.F. and the control sample. \n \nControl subjects did not differ in accuracy on the between- and within-object trials (97.9% \ncorrect on both within and between trials), and Crawford and Garthwaite\u201fs inferential test on the \ndifference scores shows that this pattern is not different from that shown by D.F. (p=0.219, \nwithin 97.2%, between 95.5%). \n 4.3. Interim discussion \n The results from this experiment again demonstrate that D.F.\u201fs allocation of attention is \nnot influenced by objects in the usual manner. As was seen in Experiment 1, D.F. responded if \nanything faster in the between-object condition, a pattern opposite to that shown by the controls. \nTaken together, the results from Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that D.F. does not exhibit the \nnormal effects of object-based attention. Before we can draw any meaningful conclusion from \nthese findings, however, it is vital to establish that D.F.\u201fs results do not simply reflect a failure of \nattention per se, but are specific to object-based attention. Experiment 3 therefore examines \nsimple covert spatial orienting in D.F., using the classic Posner spatial attention paradigm.  \n \n5. Experiment 3 \n5.1. Methods \n Experiment 3 employed a variant of the Posner\u201fs (1980) peripheral spatial cueing \nparadigm. The participant was presented with a background against which two low contrast \nplaceholders (each represented by the corners of a square) were displayed. These placeholders \nsubtended a visual angle of 10.68 deg, and were located from centre to centre 15.4 deg either \nside of fixation. The lines making up the placeholders were 0.15 deg thick. They remained \npresent on the screen throughout each experimental session. At the onset of each trial, one of the \nplaceholders would brighten for 30 ms as a spatial cue (see Fig. 5, top right). On cue-offset there \nwas an interval of either 90, 120 or 150ms before target presentation. The target was a red or \ngreen square subtending 7.84 deg, which appeared either on the same side as the cue (valid \ntarget) or on the opposite side to the cue (invalid target). There were equal numbers of valid and \ninvalid trials. \n \n \nFig 5 Experiment 3  \n- Illustrative stimuli for the Posner spatial cueing paradigm. The placeholder frames and fixation \ncross were white on a black background. The dashed pattern is used to illustrate the target, \nwhich could be either green or red. \nsample \n \nThe participant identified the target\u201fs colour as quickly and accurately as possible using one of \ntwo buttons, again using the left index finger for one button and the right index finger for the \nother. Following the response there was a 1500ms inter-trial interval during which the \nplaceholders remained visible. Participants were instructed to maintain fixation on the cross in \nthe centre of the screen throughout each experimental trial. The stability of fixation was \nmonitored using an infra-red camera. Testing was conducted in 6 blocks of 96 trials, the order of \nstimulus type (red, green) cue type (valid, invalid) and cue-target interval (90, 120 or 150ms) \nwere independently randomized within each block. The reaction times were trimmed for outliers \nand errors in the manner described for Experiment 1. This procedure removed 6% of trials as \noutliers. \n \n5.2. Results \n D.F. showed a normal pattern of spatial orienting, with validly-cued targets (i.e. \nappearing on the same side as the cue) being identified significantly faster than targets appearing \non the opposite side to the cue [t(470)=2.38, p=0.018, valid mean RT 752ms, invalid mean RT \n793ms]. A group analysis revealed the same effect for the control subjects [t(7) = 5.51, p<0.001, \nmean RT for validly cued targets 421 ms, mean RT for invalidly cued targets 448 ms]. Crawford \nand Garthwaite\u201fs (2007) Bayesian inferential test revealed that D.F.\u201fs shift costs (invalid minus \nvalid mean RTs), although quantitatively greater, did not differ significantly from those of the \ncontrols [p=0.335]. Indeed, allowing for her longer reaction times, the proportionate shift costs \nwere very similar to those of controls.  \n  \nFig 6 Experiment 3 \n-Reaction times (ms) for target discriminations following valid and invalid spatial cues. Note the \ny axis uses a different scale for D.F. and the control sample. \nCue validity did not affect accuracy for control subjects [t(7)=0.113, valid mean 98.1%; invalid \nmean 98.2%] and Crawford and Garthwaite\u201fs inferential test showed no difference between D.F. \nand the controls in terms of accuracy [p=0.669, valid 99.6%, invalid 99.2%]. \n \n6. Experiment 4 \n In Experiments 1 and 2, D.F. not only showed no cost for shifting attention between \nobjects but, if anything, appeared to shift her attention more quickly between objects than within \nthem. A possible explanation for those findings, however, is that in both of those experiments, \nthe rectangles were always presented in a vertical orientation, so that between-object shifts were \nmade horizontally whereas within-object shifts were made vertically. In another experiment \ncurrently in progress in our laboratory, we recently observed that healthy participants respond \nfaster to targets following a horizontal shift in a variation of the Egly et al (1994) paradigm in \nwhich the cue and targets were visible but the objects were not. It might be, therefore, that D.F.\u201fs \ncontrary pattern of performance in our object-based attention paradigms emerged totally \nindependently of the presence of the rectangles on the screen. That is, D.F.\u201fs performance is \ncompletely explicable if horizontal shifts can be achieved more rapidly in this task when the \noutline rectangles do not exert any influence. In Experiments 1 and 2 any such effect will have \nbeen masked for normal observers because of the influence of the objects. In Experiment 4 we \nsought to test this idea directly by retesting healthy controls using the procedures of Experiment \n1, but in the absence of the rectangular shapes. With the rectangles absent we predicted that \nnormal observers would show the same pattern of performance as D.F. showed, when the \nrectangles actually were present.  \n \n6.1. Methods \nThe procedure for Experiment 4 was identical to Experiment 1, except that the participants \n(healthy controls only) completed only one block of 96 trials. The cue and target stimuli were \nidentical to Experiment 1, but they were presented on a blank screen, without the rectangular \nshapes. Responses were made and recorded in the same way as before. The results were trimmed \nfor outliers and errors in the same manner as described for Experiment 1. This procedure \nremoved 5% of trials as outliers. \n \n6.2 Results \n When the rectangles were absent from the screen, our healthy control participants showed \nthe same pattern of performance as D.F. had done in Experiment 1. Participants showed a \ngeneral cueing effect, with responses to validly cued targets being significantly faster than those \nto invalidly cued targets (t(5)=-7.59, p=0.001, valid mean RT 382.5, invalid mean RT 426. More \ncritically their RTs to invalidly-cued targets requiring a horizontal shift of attention \n(corresponding to \u201ebetween-object\u201f trials in Experiment 1: mean RT 416 ms) were significantly \nfaster than those to targets requiring a vertical shift of attention (correspond to \u201ewithin-object\u201f \ntrials: mean RT 436 ms). Notably, while this difference across \u201ebetween\u201f and \u201ewithin\u201f object \ntrials is significant [t(5) = 3.4, p<0.05], it does not differ, in terms of Crawford and Garthwaite\u201fs \n(2007) Bayesian inferential test, from the performance of D.F. in Experiment 1 (p=0.238).  \n  \nFig. 7 - Experiment 4 \n Reaction time data (ms) for control subjects on a target discrimination task in the equivalent of \nthe three cueing conditions used in Experiment 1, but without the outline shapes. Thus the \n\u201cinvalid-within\u201d data refers to vertical attention shifts, while the \u201cinvalid-between\u201d data refers \nto horizontal shifts. D.F.\u2019s data is reproduced from Experiment 1. Note the y axis uses a different \nintercept for D.F. and the control  \n \nThere were no differences in accuracy across \u201ebetween\u201f and \u201ewithin\u201f object trials in the subjects \ntested [t(5)=0.963, invalid \u201ewithin\u201f mean 98.5%, invalid \u201ebetween\u201f mean 97%], and again \nCrawford and Garthwaite\u201fs inferential test shows that this pattern is not different from that of \nD.F. in Experiment 1 [p=0.989]. \n \n7. Discussion \n Despite D.F. clearly showing normal covert spatial attention effects (as reported in \nExperiment 3) we have found, using two different object-based attention paradigms \n(Experiments 1 and 2), that there was no evidence that the deployment of her attention was \nsensitive to the presentation of objects. In fact her performance was so insensitive to the presence \nof objects in the display that it matched that produced by healthy participants performing the task \nwhen no objects were present at all (Experiment 4). In their recent paper Martinez et al. (2006) \nargue that object-based attention effects emerge because object representations are highlighted \nby spatial attention. In these terms, our data indicate that in D.F., despite normal spatial attention, \nthere are no \u201eobjects\u201f to highlight. \n Given D.F.\u201fs severe form perception deficit, the inability of visual form representations \nin the ventral stream to influence attention could be argued to give little cause for surprise. \nRecent theorizing about object-based attention (Driver et al., 2001) has, however, emphasized \nthat object representations per se might not be influencing the allocation of attention. Rather, the \nspread of attention might be modulated by the segmentation processes that parse the visual scene \nprior to the construction of object representations. Basic segmentation processes operating within \nin the primary visual cortex are likely to be still intact in D.F., given her ability to carry out \nsimple visually guided acts of object grasping quite normally, and given that these acts are \naccompanied by normal patterns of dorsal-stream activation in the object-grasping area AIP \n(James et al., 2003). Indeed D.F. is able to differentiate figures from their background and give \naccurate perceptual reports of the number of items presented on a display (Carey, et al., 2006). \nOur results show, however, that these early stages of figure-ground segmentation are not able to \ninfluence the spread of attention. At the same time, our results do not demonstrate that attention \nis influenced solely by \u201ehigh level\u201f object representations. Whilst D.F. is clearly impaired in \nrecognizing objects on the basis of shape or form, this does not imply that the representations \nunderpinning perceptual recognition are the locus at which shape influences attention. Although \nD.F. can perform some perceptual tasks not requiring object recognition (figure-ground \nsegmentation) there are other aspects of visual processing, also not requiring object recognition, \nthat are disrupted in D.F. She is, for example, insensitive to a number of gestalt cues to \nperceptual grouping that normally influence perception (Goodale, Jakobson, Milner, Perrett, \nBenson & Hietanen, 1994). It may be the case that processes such as these are intrinsically linked \nto the genesis of object-based attention.  \n The findings of James and colleagues (2003) allow us to relate the clear bilateral \ndisruption to the object-selective area LO to D.F.\u201fs visual form agnosia. First, her lesions overlap \nalmost completely with area LO as determined in healthy controls through subtracting fMRI \nactivations caused by viewing line drawings from those caused by viewing scrambled versions of \nthose drawings. More tellingly still, a similar subtraction in D.F. yielded no net ventral stream \nactivation at all (James et al., 2003). In the context of this disruption of form processing in area \nLO, the lack of any influence of visual structure upon D.F.\u201fs attention is clearly consistent with \nthe suggestion of Martinez and colleagues (2006) that this area plays a critical role in object-\nbased attention. Again, however, it would be premature to conclude that our data prove that LO \nis essential for object-based attention, as the damage to DF\u201fs ventral stream is not solely \nrestricted to LO. We are currently attempting to test the specificity of LO involvement in object-\nbased attention by studying the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation over LO in healthy \nparticipants. \n Viewed in the context of D.F.\u201fs established abilities in calibrating manual actions to \nselected visual objects, the present data demonstrate that classic perceptual object-based attention \neffects are not required for guiding manual actions. This finding is consistent with the theoretical \nframework of Milner and Goodale (1995) and reinforces the idea that not only is form processing \nin each stream computed separately but that it serves different functions. Our results, however, \ncan only address the influence of one stream upon the other in one direction: specifically, they \nargue against ventral-stream object-based attention effects being required for the visual guidance \nof manual actions. Humphreys and Riddoch (2007) have suggested that computations in one \nstream might influence the other in the opposite direction. Specifically, they argue that the \n\u201cobjects\u201d that influence attention are not solely perceptual entities: their nature and attentional \nstatus is also influenced by the manner in which one acts upon those objects. They argue that this \ninfluence manifests itself even when specific actions are only planned, and have not yet been \nexecuted. The results of the current study demonstrate that ventral-stream form representations \nare not able to influence the spread of attention in D.F., thus providing an ideal opportunity to \ntest whether object representations localized solely within the dorsal stream might be able to \ninfluence attention. We therefore plan to explore the possibility that when D.F. is acting upon an \nobject the representations subserving that action might be able to influence the perceptual \nallocation of attention within and between object structure (cf. Schenk & Milner, 2006). \n In conclusion, although D.F. is able to show perfectly intact covert orienting of \nvisuospatial attention, her allocation of attention seems to operate in a manner that is \nindependent of the typical influence of visual structure.. That is, her attentional shifts appear to \ndepend solely on the spatial constraints of the task, and not at all on any configural constraints. \nThis result shows that the basic figure-ground segmentation that is intact in D.F. is not able to \ninfluence the spread of her visual attention. The absence of object-based attention in D.F., \ntogether with her clear bilateral lesion to area LO, is consistent with the idea that LO plays a key \nrole in object-based attention (Martinez et al., 2006). Viewed in the context of D.F.\u201fs ability to \nguide manual actions with respect to selected objects, this finding suggests that classic perceptual \nobject-based attention effects are not required when acting upon visual objects, and strengthens \nthe view that form processing in the two streams is not only distinct but serves different \nfunctions. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors are grateful to D.F. for her continuing willing cooperation, and to the MRC for their \nfinancial support (grant # G0401090).
