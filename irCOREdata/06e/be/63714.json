Introduction. \nA Critical Load (CL) is \u201ca quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more \npollutants below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of \nthe environment do not occur according to present knowledge\u201d. The concept arose in \nthe 1980\u2019s as a response to concerns over transboundary (international) air pollution \nand particularly \u201cacid rain\u201d. Because of these concerns a tool or methodology was \nrequired to help in assessing the effect of  alternative policy options to control the \n 2\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nemission of pollutants, and their subsequent dispersal, deposition and impact; CL \nwere therefore designed to work at the broad level of international agreements and \nprotocols (see http:\/\/critloads.ceh.ac.uk for more details). They are most commonly \ncalculated for acidity (caused by sulphur and nitrogen oxides) and eutrophication \n(nitrogen); CL are calculated for soils and freshwaters. Over the last two decades a \nnumber of refinements to the methodology and data have been made, however, across \nall of Europe there are only a handful of locations where all the information required \nto calculate the soil acidity CL has been measured. Recently there has been an \nincreasing demand from conservation agencies for site-specific CL, particularly for \nsites designated for biological conservation (Special Areas of Conservation, Special \nProtection Areas, etc.). Using national data to generate site specific values can give \nmisleading results; generally the location of the boundaries of the site are unavailable \nand the site is reduced to a \u201cpoint\u201d, national data use of the dominant soil and land \ncover in a one kilometre square and these may be wrong or inappropriate for the site. \nIn a national estimate with many hundreds of sites these errors will cancel each other \nout and a robust estimate can be made (of the national situation), but for someone \nfamiliar with a particular site any discrepancies will be disconcerting. \n \nThere is usually only a limited amount of relevant site-specific information and what \ninformation that is available often requires interpretation. One piece of information \nthat is always available from the Conservation Agencies is the vegetation type, which \nis always described within well defined and detailed classification systems. We \nsought an analysis method that would allow us to exploit whatever local information \nwas available whilst making the uncertainty in expert opinion an explicit part of the \nreasoning process; Endorsement Theory (Cohen 1985) which was designed for \n 3\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nreasoning with incomplete information meets these requirements. Confidence in the \nCL estimated from the site-specific information will be variable; the \u201cbest\u201d CL value \nshould combine both the local and national estimates. We wished to keep the \nuncertainty in both estimates explicit and therefore combine both strands of evidence \nusing Dempster-Shafer (Dempster 1967, Shafer 1976) which in this context is \neffectively an extension of Bayesian statistics. \n \n2. Using Endorsement Theory to set site specific Critical Loads \nEndorsement Theory (ET) (Cohen 1985) is a form of reasoning with incomplete and \nuncertain evidence. The approach was developed in the AI (artificial intelligence) \ncommunity in an attempt to develop systems that could reason in a more human \nmanner and particularly the ability of human experts to \u201cdiagnose\u201d situations with \nlimited information. The approach is particularly useful for: \n\u2022 Allowing inference to be made from partial knowledge.  \n\u2022 Making the reasoning process explicit, traceable and highly heuristic. \n\u2022 Avoiding the need to translate expert knowledge into numerical values. \nIn the case of trying to set a site specific CL we typically do not have much \ninformation on the environmental conditions in the designated site, even such crucial \ninformation as the soil series is not consistently readily available. Typically the \nlocation of the designated feature (ie, habitat or species) is unknown (or is \nunavailable), nor is there often information on the relationship between the designated \nfeature and the limited number of habitats for which CL methods are available. ET is \na way of marshalling whatever local information we may be able to obtain for a site \nand of providing a very simple indication of the expected reliability of the \ninformation. \n 4\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nIn the UK soils have been categorised into six acidity CL classes; five for mineral and \norgano-mineral soils (Loveland 1991; Hornung et al, 1995), and a sixth class for the \npeat soils for which a different methodology is used (Calver et al 2004). For the \npurpose of using ET we consider each CL class as if it were a separate hypothesis. We \nseek to determine the extent to which the available data supports each hypothesis. The \nprocedure to produce an endorsement for a CL for a site can be summarised as;  \n\u2022 Determine what \u201cdesignated features\u201d exist on the site; these can be habitats or \nspecies and in general information on their exact location is unavailable. \n\u2022 Assume that protecting the existing vegetation will protect the designated \nfeature.  \n\u2022 Reclassify the recorded vegetation classes in terms of the National Vegetation \nClassification (NVC) (Rodwell 1991 et seq) (many sites are already described \nin terms of the NVC). \n\u2022 Using the descriptions in the Rodwell books obtain information about the \nenvironment where the relevant NVC class(es) is typically found. \n\u2022 Process the environmental information in Loveland (ibid) to produce Look-up-\nTables of the \u201cweight of evidence\u201d than an environmental factor gives to each \nCL class. \n\u2022 Link the environmental information from the NVC to the environmental \ninformation in Loveland (ibid) on the basis of common terms and synonyms. \n\u2022 Combine the \u201cweights of evidence\u201d for all the environmental factors relating \nto an NVC class to produce an \u201cendorsement\u201d for each CL class. \n \n2.1 Primary information sources \n 5\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nInformation on the designated features and the vegetation cover of the designated sites \nis always obtainable from the Conservation Agencies and will not be discussed \nfurther. \n \nThe NVC (Rodwell 1991 et seq) is the de-facto standard description of natural and \nsemi-natural vegetation communities in the UK. Each class is described over several \n(~10) pages of text, but, the amount of environmental information (soils, geology, \ntopography, climate, geography, management etc.) is inconsistent; communities are \nalso very variable in their fidelity to particular conditions. Information about each \nclass has been extracted and stored in an MS Access database as text using Rodwell\u2019s \nvocabulary; examples for two heath communities are shown in Table 1.   \nTable 1. About here. \nLoveland (ibid) uses the methodology documented in Hornung et al (1995) to allocate \n298 soil associations in England and Wales into one of the six CL acidity classes. \nInformation on the physical characteristics of the dominant soil series in each \nassociation is also provided, for example, for the Worcester association (431): \nGeology:  Permo-Trias red mudstone, \nMineralogy:  Chlorite \/ carbonates, \nTexture:  Clayey \/ fine loam, \nLand Use:  Stock rearing \/ arable, \nComment:  Slow drainage.   \nCL class: 2.0-4.0 keq ha-1 yr-1 \nAll soil associations are described in the national hierarchical soil classification \nscheme (NSRI, Soil Survey 1985); the Worcester association (431) being: \nMajor group:  Pelosols, \n 6\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nSub-group:  Argillic pelosols, \nType:   Typical argillic pelosol. \n \nThe data in Loveland has been summarised into seven look-up-tables (LUT); \u201csoil \nassociation\u201d, \u201cmajor group\u201d, \u201csub-group\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d \u201ctexture\u201d, \u201cgeology\u201d and  \n\u201ccomment\u201d, (that is excluding \u201cmineralogy\u201d and \u201cland use\u201d). In each LUT the cells in \nthe table record the number of soil associations that share a particular attribute and \nhave been allocated to a particular CL class. In Table 2 (an example LUT) it can be \nseen that there are a total of 130 soil associations in the major group \u201cbrown soils\u201d, of \nwhich three have a CL of 0-0.2 keq ha-1 year-1; 27 have a CL of 0.2-05 keq ha-1 year-1; \n57 a CL of 0.5-1.0 keq ha-1 year-1 and so on.  \nTable 2 about here. \nTable 2 shows that some \u201cmajor groups\u201d have a high fidelity to a particular CL class \neg. \u201cpodzol\u201d, others eg \u201cbrown soils\u201d are much more variable and the \u201clithomorphic\u201d \ngroup appears to be bi-modal (those  derived from chalk and limestone versus those \nderived from granite and sandstone). \n \nExpert opinion is used to decide how much \u201cweight of evidence\u201d should be put on \neach entry in the LUT; for example how much reliance should be put on the \nobservation that 3 out of 130 soil associations in the \u201cbrown soil\u201d group have a low \nCL and how much weight should be given to the observation that 20 out of 29 \n\u201cpodzol\u201d group have a high CL? We contend that most people consider that 20 out of \n29 provides stronger evidence than 3 out of 130; the question is how to express that \nbelief? In a standard knowledge engineering approach numerical scales are used eg \nchoose a number between 0 and 10. In ET the scale is expressed in words (eg weak, \n 7\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nstrong, overwhelming) and it is the responsibility of the domain expert and not the \nknowledge engineer to define this \u201cscale\u201d. We used a scale with four categories; \n\u201cstrong\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cvery weak\u201d. Other experts may prefer other \ncategories; in the context of land cover change Comber et al (2003) use; \u201cconclusive\u201d, \n\u201cprima-facie\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d; whatever scale is chosen by the domain expert \nthey have to be explicit. Having defined their scale the expert needs to allocate each \nvalue in the LUT into one of their categories. In this case the two cells marked \u201cs\u201d in \nTable 2 are the only ones to provide a \u201cstrong\u201d weight. \n \n2.2 Relating NVC soils information to soils terminology used by Loveland \nThe environmental information provided about each NVC classes needs to be related \nto the terminology used by Loveland.  Sometimes there is an exact correspondence \nbetween terms used in the NVC and in Loveland and the NSRI. More often terms are \nsimilar but different, for example, \u201cbrown soil\u201d in Loveland and \u201cbrown earth\u201d in the \nNVC. In some cases there is no correspondence; for example, several NVC \ncommunities are associated with the \u201cBorrowdale Volcanics\u201d in the Lake District, but \nLoveland does not use that term. A LUT is used to relate the NVC terms to the \nLoveland terms, in linking the terms we are conservative and when in doubt we do not \ninfer a connection. \n \n2.3 Combining the Evidence to produce an Endorsement \nThe weights of evidence for each piece of environmental information are collated and \ncombined to produce an overall endorsement for each CL class for the NVC class in \nquestion; in ET the categories are determined by the domain expert and are expressed \nin words not numbers. We use a scale with five levels of endorsement:  \n 8\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \n\u2022 \u201cDefinitive\u201d, three pieces of \u201cstrong\u201d evidence and no conflicting evidence. \n\u2022 \u201cConfident\u201d, two pieces of \u201cstrong\u201d evidence and no \u201cstrong\u201d conflict. \n\u2022 \u201cLikely\u201d, at least one piece of \u201cstrong\u201d evidence or three \u201cmoderates\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cpossible\u201d, at least one \u201cmoderate\u201d or two \u201cweak\u201d pieces of evidence. \n\u2022 \u201cweak\u201d, at least one piece of evidence. \n \nTable 1 shows the environmental data for two NVC heathland classes: H1 (Calluna \nvulgaris-Festuca ovina) and H21 (Calluna vulgaris-Vaccinium myrtillus-Sphagnum \ncapillifolium).  There are multiple entries for some attributes (for example H1 has \nthree references to geology) and each of these \u201cstatements\u201d is treated independently \nand given equal weight. Table 3 provides all the evidence for H1 that could be \nextracted.  \nTable 3 about here. \nIn this case we cannot give a \u201cdefinitive\u201d endorsement but we are \u201cConfident\u201d that the \nH1 heath should have a CL class 0.2-0.5keq ha-1yr-1. It is \u201cLikely\u201d that the CL is \nlower but there are only \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cpossible\u201d endorsements for a higher CL. \nRepeating the process with H21 reveals a problem; H21 is associated with \n\u201cfragmentary humic ranker\u201d soils which are in the lithomorphic group. Most (20 out \nof 25) lithomorphic soils (the rendzinas) have a high CL (as they are derived from \nchalk or limestone).  This leads to a strong endorsement for a high CL for H21, \nwhereas a lower CL is more appropriate for humic ranker soils. \n \nOf the 22 NVC Heaths none were awarded a \u201cdefinitive\u201d endorsement and only five \nhad a \u201cconfident\u201d attribution. Twelve Heaths are associated with rankers \n(lithomorphic soils) and therefore like H21 have erroneous \u201cLikely\u201d endorsements for \n 9\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \na high CL. If a strict interpretation of the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d were adopted (ie, \nany evidence no matter how weak) all but two of the Heaths would be allocated to the \nlowest CL class. \n \n3. Combining National and Local Estimates \nET provides an estimate of the CL for a site based on knowledge about the NVC \nclasses; however, the CL can also be estimated from the national-scale data \n(http:\/\/critloads.ceh.ac.uk) based on the dominant soil in each 1km grid square. In \ncombining the local (ET approach) and the national data we assume: \n\u2022 Both strands of evidence are uncertain. \n\u2022 Both strands of evidence have value. \nTo combine both estimates we need to either convert the national estimates into words \nto be compatible with ET or convert the endorsements from words to numbers, we \nchoose the latter. Bayesian inference is concerned with the extent to which our belief \nin a hypothesis increases or decreases as a new piece of evidence becomes available. \nDempster-Shafer (DS) (Dempster 1967, Shafer 1976) can be considered an extension \nof the Bayesian approach which is useful because: \n\u2022 it provides an explicit representation of uncertainty and,  \n\u2022 weak evidence for something does not imply strong evidence for the opposite. \nIn DS belief and plausibility provide the upper and lower bounds of probability for a \nproposition; belief+uncertainty=plausibility and belief+uncertainty+disbelief=1. \n \n3.1 Estimating uncertainty \nHall et al (2004) investigated the uncertainty in national estimates using a Monte \nCarlo approach. They generated a mean CL and variance for every one km square \n 10\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nbased on the dominant and sub-dominant soils; and showed that the assumption of a \nGaussian distribution was reasonable. Given a mean and standard deviation the \nprobability (belief) that the true value is within any particular range can be easily \ncalculated from the cumulative probabilities of the class limits, (eg using \u201cnormdist\u201d \nin Microsoft Excel). Converting the ET endorsements into numerical values is a \nclassic knowledge engineering problem and the values in Table 4 express our expert \nopinion, the key methodological issue is that they are explicit, and therefore open to \nscrutiny and investigation into how sensitive the results are to the values selected. \nTable 4 about here. \n \n3.2 Mathematical formulation \nTo combine two strands of evidence we use the form of DS suggested by Tangestani \n& Moore (2002):  \nB12 = (B1* B2 + B1*U2 + B2*U1) \/ \u03b2     Equation 1. \n\u03b2 = 1 \u2013 B1*D2 \u2013 B2*D1     Equation 2 \nWhere: \nB = belief, D = disbelief & U = uncertainty; \n\u03b2 is a normalising factor, (to ensure that B + D + U = 1).   \n \n3.3 A worked example \nConsider a site covered in H1 heath where the national data estimate a mean CL of \n0.6 keq ha-1 year-1, a standard deviation of 0.2 and a Gaussian distribution. Table 5 \nsummarises the beliefs from the ET (local) and national estimates. \nTable 5 about here \n 11\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \nThe strongest endorsement is for the CL class 0.2-0.5 keq ha-1 year-1. From Table 5; \nB1=0.75, U1=0.2, D1=0.05 & B2=0.286, U2=0.0, D2=0.714. Applying the equations: \n\u03b2 = (1 \u2013 0.75*0.714 \u2013 0.286*0.05) = 0.450 \nB12 = (0.75* 0.286 + 0.75*0.0 + 0.286*0.2) \/ 0.450  = 0.604 \nIn contrast the national data give the highest probability to the hypothesis of CL class \n0.5-1.0 keq ha-1 year-1; from Table 5; B1=0.25, U1=0.3, D1=0.45 & B2=0.669, U2=0.0, \nD2=0.331 Applying the equations: \n \u03b2 = (1 \u2013 0.25*0.331 \u2013 0.669*0.45) = 0.616 \nB12 = (0.25* 0.669 + 0.25*0.0 + 0.669*0.30) \/ 0.616 = 0.597 \nThe beliefs in the other classes are small, for example the combined belief that the CL \nclass is 1.0-2.0 keq ha-1 year-1 is 0.013. As the hypotheses are independent the Beliefs \ndo not sum to one. In this case the inclusion of knowledge about the vegetation \ncommunity at the site will lead us to revise the CL downwards from the national \nestimate. If the more traditional Bayesian statistic is used (allocating all uncertainty to \ndisbelief) the conclusion to revise the CL downwards is stronger (belief in CL class \n0.2-0.5 is 0.546 and in CL class 0.5-1.0 is 0.403). \n \n4. Conclusions \nUncertain, incomplete and contradictory information is common in all areas of \nenvironmental science. Decision makers and land managers want estimates specific to \na particular designated site but they lack resources to make the required \nmeasurements. Data collected to assess national or super-national concerns will not be \nideal for site specific concerns. Endorsement Theory allows incomplete information \nto be assessed and combined in a way that makes expert opinion explicit, traceable \nand transparent; for each piece of evidence we know where it came from, what \n 12\nSetting site specific Critical Loads \n\u201cweight\u201d it was given by the expert and how the evidence was combined to produce \nan endorsement. The reasons for the endorsement of any hypothesis can be clearly \nidentified and tested against other opinions. There are a number of technical issues \nconcerned with the use of Endorsement Theory that need further investigation, but \nperhaps more important is the fact that non-numeric methods like Endorsement \nTheory are not widely used, and the extent to which there will be cultural and \norganisational resistance to their use needs to be investigated. The Dempster-Shafer \nformalism allows the combination of uncertain information when the probability \nmodel can be assumed to be complete. Combining the two approaches provides a \nuseful tool for combining variable and incomplete information to provide a better \nestimate of CL for a site. \n \nAcknowledgements. \nSome of the ideas expressed in this paper were developed during a contract funded by \nthe UK Environment Agency, project manager, Dr. Rob Kinnersley.
