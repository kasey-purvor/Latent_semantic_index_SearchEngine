Paris-sud,\nCampus Polytechnique, RD 128, 91127 Palaiseau cedex, France\n(Dated: February 1, 2008)\nQuantum computers have the capability of out-\nperforming their classical counterparts for cer-\ntain computational problems [1]. Several scalable\nquantum computing architectures have been pro-\nposed. An attractive architecture is a large set of\nphysically independant qubits, arranged in three\nspatial regions where (i) the initialized qubits are\nstored in a register, (ii) two qubits are brought\ntogether to realize a gate, and (iii) the readout of\nthe qubits is performed [2, 3]. For a neutral atom-\nbased architecture, a natural way to connect these\nregions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits\nwithin the system. In this letter we demonstrate\nthe coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on an\natom trapped in a sub-micron tweezer, over a dis-\ntance typical of the separation between atoms in\nan array of optical traps [4, 5, 6]. Furthermore,\nwe transfer a qubit between two tweezers, and\nshow that this manipulation also preserves the\ncoherence of the qubit.\nIn the quest for an implementation of a quantum com-\nputer, scalability is a major concern. In the trapped\nion approach (see e.g. [7]), a lot of effort is being de-\nvoted to building arrays of small ion traps [8], and to\nmoving ion qubits whilst avoiding heating and decoher-\nence [9]. Neutral atoms also offer promising properties for\nthe realization of large quantum registers. For example,\none- or two-dimensional adressable arrays of dipole traps\nhave been demonstrated using holographic techniques [4],\nmicro-fabricated elements [5], or active rearrangement of\nsingle atoms [6, 10]. An alternative approach is to use the\nMott insulator transition to initialize a three-dimensional\nregister by loading a Bose-Einstein condensate into an\noptical lattice [11]. Recent progress has shown subwave-\nlength addressability in such a system [12]. To perform\nquantum computations, however, an additional key fea-\nture is the ability to perform the gate between two arbi-\ntrary qubits of the register.\nHere we demonstrate a scheme where a neutral atom\nqubit is transfered between two moving tweezers (\u201creg-\nister\u201d to \u201cmoving head\u201d), and then transported towards\nan interaction zone where the two-qubit gate should be\nimplemented [13, 14, 15, 16]. We show that these manip-\nulations of the external degrees of freedom preserve the\ncoherence of the qubit, and do not induce any heating.\nThis transport in a moving tweezer is a promising alter-\nnative to the recently demonstrated transport of qubits\nin \u201coptical conveyor belts\u201d [6, 17], or in state-dependent\nmoving optical lattices [18]. Altogether, these results\npave the way towards a scalable neutral atom quantum\ncomputing architecture.\nIn our experiment, we trap a single rubidium 87 atom\nin an optical dipole trap created by a tightly focused\nlaser beam [19, 20]. As described in detail in [21], the\nqubit is encoded onto the |0\u3009 = |F = 1,M = 0\u3009 and\n|1\u3009 = |F = 2,M = 0\u3009 hyperfine ground states separated\nby \u03c9hf \u2248 6.8 GHz. We initialize the qubit in state |0\u3009 by\noptically pumping the atom. We drive single-qubit op-\nerations by a Raman transition using two phased-locked\nlaser beams, one of which being the dipole trap. The in-\nternal dephasing time of the qubit, measured by Ramsey\ninterferometry, is \u2248 630 \u00b5sec. This time is mostly limited\nby the residual motion of the atom in the trap that leads\nto a fluctuation of the frequency of the qubit transition.\nThis dephasing can be reversed by applying a spin echo\ntechnique where a pi pulse is inserted between the two\npi\/2 pulses of the Ramsey sequence. Using this technique\nwe measure an irreversible dephasing time of 34 ms.\nThe experimental setup for the moving tweezer is rep-\nresented in figure 1. We reflect the dipole trap beam off\na mirror affixed to a tip-tilt platform prior to the large\nnumerical aperture lens. The platform is actuated by\npiezo-electrical transducers and can rotate with a maxi-\nmal angle of 2.5 mrad in both the horizontal and vertical\ndirections. We have measured the position of the dipole\ntrap for different angles of the platform by observing the\nposition of the atom on the CCD camera. The maximal\nangle corresponds to a total displacement of the tweezer\nof 18\u00b11 \u00b5m. This motion is two-dimensional, as demon-\nstrated in figure 1.\nWe first analyze the influence of a displacement of the\ntweezer on the external degrees of freedom of the qubit.\nFor this purpose, we measure the temperature of the sin-\ngle atom in the tweezer using a release and recapture\ntechnique [22] (see Methods). In the absence of motion,\nthe temperature of the atom is 56.0 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5K. We re-\npeat this measurement after moving the tweezer by a\ntotal distance of 360 \u00b5m, consisting of 20 round trips of\n18 \u00b5m, along the z-axis. Each round trip lasts a time\nof 6 ms. We do not find any measurable loss due to\nthis transport. After the motion, we measure a temper-\nature of 54.8\u00b1 1.6 \u00b5K. As the energy difference between\ntwo vibrational quanta in the radial direction is 4 \u00b5K,\nthis temperature is compatible with no change in the ra-\ndial vibrational state. This absence of motional heating\nis a crucial feature for entanglement schemes based on\ncontrolled collisions [16, 23] and results from the adia-\nbaticity of the displacement. A motion is adiabatic if the\n2FIG. 1: Experimental setup. A large numerical aperture lens\nfocuses two independent dipole trap beams at 810 nm each\nto a size of 0.9 micrometers. An optical power of 400 \u00b5W\nresults into a trap depth of 500 \u00b5K and oscillation frequen-\ncies of 81 kHz and 15 kHz, in the radial and axial directions\nrespectively. The two trapping lasers have the same linear\npolarization and their frequencies are separated by 10 MHz\nto avoid interferences. The moving tweezer is displaced by\nrotating a tip-tilt platform. The same large numerical aper-\nture lens is used to collect the fluorescence light at 780 nm\nfrom the atom. This fluorescence light is separated from the\ntrapping light by the dichroic mirror and sent to a single-\nphoton counter module and a CCD camera. The insert shows\na fluorescence picture of an atom moved along an elliptical\ntrajectory in the y-z plane. The picture is a summation of 5\nimages taken at different times during the motion.\nacceleration a fulfills ma\u03c3 \u226a h\u00af\u2126 (\u2126 is the oscillation fre-\nquency of the atom, m its mass and \u03c3 the extension of\nthe ground state wave function [24]). This gives a maxi-\nmum acceleration of \u2248 104 m\/sec2, much larger than the\nexperimentally measured \u2248 15 m\/sec2.\nWe secondly study the influence of the motion on the\ncoherence of the qubit. As the duration of the transport\nis larger than the dephasing time of the qubit (630 \u00b5s),\nwe apply the spin echo sequence to rephase the qubit [21].\nThe time sequence of the experiment is shown in figure 2.\nFigure 3(a) shows the amplitude of the spin-echo fringes\nfor various trap displacements along the y-axis. This\namplitude is constant when we scan the tweezer over all\nthe transverse field of the objective. This demonstrates\nthat the motion does not affect the internal coherence of\nthe qubit. We observe the same behavior when we move\nthe tweezer along the z-axis.\nWe also observe a phase shift of the spin-echo fringes,\nas shown in figure 3(b). This is a signature that the two\nstates of the qubit dephase with respect to each other\nduring the motion (in a reproducible way), despite the\npresence of the rephasing pi pulse. We attribute this\nphase shift to the asymmetry of the trajectory during\nFIG. 2: Principle of the moving qubit experiment. (a) Posi-\ntion of the atom when the pulses of the spin echo sequence\nare applied. Starting at the initial position, the first pulse\nprepares the atom in a superposition (|0\u3009 + |1\u3009)\/\u221a2. The\ntweezer is then moved along the y-axis to the target position\nand the pi pulse is applied. Finally, the tweezer is brought\nback to its initial position and the coherence is checked by\napplying a second pi\/2 pulse and measuring the state of the\nqubit. (b) Example of displacement of the tweezer versus\ntime. The signal is obtained from the sensor attached to the\ntip-tilt platform, which is converted into a distance travelled\nby the tweezer. The pi\/2 and pi pulses, being 2 and 4 \u00b5s long\nrespectively, are not to scale.\nthe first and second part of the round trip displacement.\nWe have modelled this effect and found a good agreement\nwith the data (see Methods section). This understanding\nof the phase evolution of the qubit during the motion is\ncrucial for a possible implementation in a quantum com-\nputer where qubit phases need to be controlled.\nWith the idea of transfering an atom from the \u201creg-\nister\u201d to the \u201cmoving head\u201d, we have investigated the\ntransfer of a qubit from one tweezer to a second one. For\nthis experiment, the two traps are superimposed and the\npositions of both tweezers are fixed. The experimental\nsequence is shown in figure 4(a). We load an atom in the\nfirst tweezer, transfer it to a second tweezer, and trans-\nfer it back to the first tweezer, with no measurable loss.\nWhen the two traps have the same depth, we measure\na temperature of the atom after the double transfer of\n56.3\u00b1 1.8 \u00b5K, while the temperature with no transfer is\n53.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5K. Therefore, the transfer does not induce\nany significant motional heating.\n3FIG. 3: Results of the moving qubit experiment. Figure (a)\nshows the amplitude of the spin echo signal versus the ampli-\ntude of the displacement. The error bars are the root mean\nsquare (RMS) uncertainty obtained from the fit of the fringes.\nThe 60% contrast is a result of the damping of the fringes af-\nter 6 ms [21]. The dashed line represents the average of the\ndata for no trap displacement. Figure (b) shows the phase\nshift versus the amplitude of the displacement. The trian-\ngles are the data and the circles are the calculated value of\nthe dephasing based on the model described in the Methods\nsection.\nWe analyze the influence of the transfer on the coher-\nence of the qubit by inserting the double transfer between\nthe two pi\/2 pulses of a Ramsey sequence, as shown in fig-\nure 4(a). Figure 4 presents the amplitude and the phase\nof the Ramsey fringes after this sequence for depths of\nthe second tweezer ranging from 0.2 mK to 0.6 mK. This\ntransfer does not affect the amplitude of the Ramsey sig-\nnal when the depth of the second trap is varied, thus\nshowing that the coherence is robust against the transfer\nbetween the two traps.\nFigure 4(c) shows that the phase of the Ramsey fringes,\nvaries linearly with respect to the depth of the second\ntrap. This is explained by the differential potential ex-\nperienced by the two states, which is proportional to the\ndepth of the trap U . If the depths of the two traps differ\nby \u2206U , the Ramsey fringes are shifted after a holding\ntime T by a phase proportional to \u2206U T\/h\u00af, with respect\nto the situation where no transfer is applied. This phase\nis thus a useful tool to make sure that the two traps are\nidentical.\nAs a conclusion we have shown that we can move and\ntransfer a single qubit between two tweezers with no mea-\nsurable motional heating. We have also shown no loss\nof coherence of the atomic qubit under transfer and dis-\nplacement. In combination with our holographic array of\nFIG. 4: Experiment on the transfer of the qubit between two\ntweezers. Figure (a) details the time sequence. A pi\/2 pulse\nis applied when the atom is initially in trap 1, which has a\ndepth of 500 \u00b5K. The atom is transferred to trap 2 in a time\nof 20 \u00b5s. After a time of 160 \u00b5s, the atom is transferred back\nto trap 1 and a second pi\/2 pulse is applied. Figure (b) shows\nthe amplitude of the spin echo signal as a function of the\ndepth of the trap the atom is transferred into. The error bars\nare the RMS uncertainty obtained from the fit of the fringes.\nFigure (c) displays the phase of the Ramsey oscillations for\ndifferent depths of the second trap. The solid line is a linear\nfit to the data. The dashed lines in (b) and (c) correspond to\nno transfer.\ndipole traps [4], and efficient single-qubit operation and\nreadout [21], we have made a first step towards designing\na scalable architecture of a quantum computer based on\nneutral atoms.\nMethods:\nTemperature measurement:\nAfter trapping a single atom, we switch off the dipole\ntrap for a time adjustable between 1 and \u223c 30 \u00b5sec. We\nthen turn the trap back on and check for the presence of\nthe atom. We repeat this sequence 100 times for each re-\nlease time and calculate the probability to recapture the\natom after the corresponding time of flight. We compare\n4our data with a 3-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation,\ntaking into account the potential produced by the Gaus-\nsian trapping beam, and assuming a thermal distribution\nof the position and the velocity of the atom at the be-\nginning of the time of flight. The error bar of this fitted\ntemperature corresponds to one standard deviation in the\nleast square-based fit.\nPhase shift during the motion:\nThe hyperfine splitting of 6.8 GHz means that the\ndipole trap detuning is slightly larger for |0\u3009 than for |1\u3009,\ngiving rise to a small differential lightshift. Therefore\nthe qubit transition frequency is \u03c9hf + \u03b7U\/h\u00af, with U the\ndepth of the dipole trap and \u03b7 = 7 \u00d7 10\u22124 for our trap.\nIf the tweezer is not moved, the pi-pulse compensates for\nthe phase accumulated during the two parts of the mo-\ntion. When the tweezer is moved off axis, the waist of the\nbeam increases sligthly, resulting in a shallower trap. Fig-\nure 2(a) shows that with the tweezer starting on axis, the\natom spends more time far from the axis where the dipole\ntrap is shallower, whereas on the way back it spends more\ntime around the axis where the dipole trap is stronger.\nThe average depth is then different for the two parts of\nthe motion, and so are the phases. As the phase of the\nspin-echo signal is the difference of the phases accumu-\nlated during the two periods of the motion, it is expected\nto vary as we move the tweezer further away off axis. We\nhave modelled this effect by calculating the dephasing ac-\ncumulated during the transport, taking into account the\nactual displacement of the tweezer from the sensor curve\nand the measured Rabi frequencies for different positions\nof the tweezer off axis. The result of this model is shown\nas circles in figure 3(b) and is consistent with the data.\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank W.D.\nPhillips, T. Porto, I. Deutsch, P.
