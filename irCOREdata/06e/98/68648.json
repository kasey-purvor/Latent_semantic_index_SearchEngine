As so often happens in\nscience, this is a case of a very interesting result that, in\nretrospect, seems unsurprising: we note that the coupling lifts\nthe degeneracy of the eigenfrequencies of the individual os-\ncillators, causing them to split and thus yield additional reso-\nnances, each of which can give rise to SR, of type ~a! in the\nsense introduced in @2#. Some of the results for power spectra\nin the absence of driving are potentially important, but their\ninterpretation, and some of the terminology, seem to us con-\nfusing. The results on noise-enhanced propagation, which\nprobably represent the most interesting application, are also\npresented in an ambiguous way.\nThe main aim of the present Comment is to address and\nclarify some of the confusion and to urge the authors of @1#\nto remove the remaining ambiguity. In doing so, we discuss\nthe relationship of @1# to the existing understanding of SR, in\ngeneral, and in monostable underdamped nonlinear oscilla-\ntors, in particular, and we point out a possible extension of\nthe authors\u2019 central idea to a system that may be expected to\nexhibit a much more dramatic manifestation of array-\nenhanced multiple SR. We also generalize the idea of @1# to\nencompass a wider range of systems.\nThe major quantity considered in @1# ~and in what follows\nwe will mostly use the notation of @1#! is\nR@ f D#5\nS@ f D#\nB@ f D# , ~1!\nwhere S@ f D# is the power spectrum of one of the oscillators\nin the array in the absence of a periodic driving force, and\nB@ f D# is some \u2018\u2018smooth background\u2019\u2019 in such a spectrum:\nalthough an explicit definition of B@ f D# is absent from the\npaper, it follows implicitly from Fig. 1 and has been con-\nfirmed by one of the authors that, when the temperature T\n~i.e., the noise intensity, appropriately normalized! is small or\nmoderate, B@ f D# in the range of frequencies near f D is of the1063-651X\/2002\/66~1!\/013101~3!\/$20.00 66 0131order of S@ f D50# . This, in turn, is approximately propor-\ntional to T so that B}T to a good approximation.\nThe authors mostly refer to the quantity R as the spectral\nresponse, and they discuss its dependence on noise intensity;\nf D is called the driving frequency. We wish to point out,\nhowever, that the response to a periodic driving force is not\nproportional either to R or to S, so that its dependence on\nnoise intensity may differ markedly from that of R or S. In\nreality, it is only the imaginary part of the generalized sus-\nceptibility x that is proportional to S @5#, the real part being\nrelated to it by one of the Kramers-Kro\u00a8nig relations @5#.\nLet us write this in rigorous terms. If the driving force is\nsinusoidal, i.e., ADcos(2pfDt), then the response of the sys-\ntem may be written in terms of the shift of its generalized\ncoordinate ~e.g., the coordinate of one of the array oscillators\nas in @1#! averaged over the statistical ensemble. In the\nasymptotic limit AD\u21920, such a response is proportional to\nAD and sinusoidal in time @5#:\nd^q~ t !&[^q~ t !&AD2^q&AD50\n5ADRe@x~ f D!exp~2i2p f Dt !# , ~2!\nwhere x is the generalized ~complex! susceptibility @5#. From\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem @5# and one of the\nKramers-Kro\u00a8nig relations @5#, the imaginary and real parts of\nx are, respectively,\nIm@x~ f D!#5\n2p2 f D\nT S~ f D!,\nRe@x~ f D!#5\n4p\nT PE0\n\u2018\nd f f\n2S~ f !\nf 22 f D2\n, ~3!\nwhere T is temperature @equivalent to s2\/(2048f Dg) in the\nnotation of @1#, with m51# and P denotes the Cauchy prin-\ncipal part. In the context of SR, these relations were first\nused in @6#.\nIf one characterizes the response by the intensity Id\n~square! of the d spike at the driving frequency f D in the\npower spectrum of the driven system, which is one of the\u00a92002 The American Physical Society01-1\nCOMMENTS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 013101 ~2002!most important characteristics of the response ~cf. @3,6,7#!,\nthen it is easily shown @6# that\nId5\n1\n4 AD\n2 ux~ f D!u2. ~4!\nThe authors of @1# infer a \u2018\u2018distinct SR\u2019\u2019 in their system based\non the fact that the quantity R may drastically increase as\nnoise intensity changes from zero and passes through certain\noptimal values. This occurs because the spectrum in the ab-\nsence of driving, S@ f # , has pronounced peaks whose maxima\nshift in frequency as noise intensity grows. But, in reality,\nthings are not so simple because, as pointed out above, the\nresponse to an input signal is not simply proportional to R.\nThe system\u2019s response to a weak periodic driving force is\ncompletely specified by the complex susceptibility x( f D).\nAnd Eqs. ~2! and ~3! show that it is only the imaginary part\nof x( f D) that can be maximized through \u2018\u2018tuning\u2019\u2019 by noise;\nin the range of small temperatures, it differs from R only by\na temperature-independent factor. The real part of x( f D) be-\nhaves differently, and must also be taken into account. A\nsimple analysis of Eq. ~3! for an isolated Duffing oscillator\n~cf. @3#! shows that Im@x( f D)# at the temperature Tm\n[Tm( f D) yielding its maximum, and Re@x( f D)# at the same\nT are of the same order as Re@x( f D)# at T50. As in @1#, we\nare assuming here that the deviation of f D from the natural\nfrequency f 0 greatly exceeds the friction parameter g , while\nbeing less or of the same order as f 0 : g! f D2 f 0& f 0; and\nwe also allow for the explicit expression @8# for the spectrum\nS@ f # in the Duffing oscillator in the relevant range of fre-\nquencies and temperatures. Consequently, as T varies, the\nmaximum possible ratio of ux( f D)u to its value at T50 is not\nmuch larger than unity ~cf. @2#, where it was \u20192.5 for an\noscillator similar to the oscillator used in @1#!. This is in\ncontrast to the analogous ratio for R@ f D# \u0084and, similarly, for\nIm@x( f D)#\u0085, which is typically larger by a few orders of\nmagnitude ~cf. Fig. 3 in @1#!. The situation for arrays should\nbe similar. This inference could readily be checked by per-\nforming an explicit calculation of uxu using Eq. ~3! and the\nspectra S@ f # presented in @1#, and\/or backed up by a digital\nor analog simulation of the array in the presence of a peri-\nodic driving force.\nLindner et al. @1# comment that R is \u2018\u2018faithful to the\nsquared stochastic amplification factor\u2019\u2019 ~SAF! introduced in\n@2#, but we must point out that this is not quite right, for the\nreasons discussed above. The SAF is the ratio between the\namplitudes of the response in the presence and absence of\nnoise which, in the asymptotic limit of vanishing driving\namplitude, is equal to the ratio between the absolute values\nof the corresponding generalized susceptibilities or, equiva-\nlently, between the square roots of the intensities Id of the d\nspike. It follows from our analysis above that neither the\nSAF, nor its square, behave in just the same way as R.\nIn @1# R is sometimes referred to ~e.g., in captions to Figs.\n4 and 5! as the signal-to-noise ratio ~SNR!. But R is not an\nSNR\u2014at least not in the conventionally accepted sense of\nbeing the ratio of a signal at the output ~i.e., the difference\nbetween the outputs in the presence and absence of periodic\ndriving! to the noise at the output ~i.e., the output in the01310absence of periodic driving!. For example, the SNR of @7#,\nwhich is still widely used, relates to Id and S@ f D#:\n~SNR!5\nId\nS@ f D# . ~5!\nAlthough there is no single universally accepted definition of\nthe SNR, it is in our view confusing to refer to R as an SNR,\ngiven that R refers to quantities both of which are measured\nin the absence of driving. Moreover, as shown in @3#, the\nconventional SNR ~5! exhibits local maxima as a function of\nnoise only for special classes of systems ~see below!; but the\nsymmetrical monostable Duffing oscillator considered in @1#\ndoes not belong to such a class. So the allusion by Lindner\net al. to multiple SNR maxima in their system is potentially\nmisleading.\nSection V of @1# treats the interesting and potentially im-\nportant question of how a signal propagates in the presence\nof noise if the array of underdamped oscillators is driven\nperiodically along one side only. Unlike Secs. III and IV,\ntherefore, it deals with the effect of a real periodic driving\nforce rather than a virtual one. The signal propagation is\ndiscussed in terms of an SNR which evidently differs from\nthe R defined by Eq. ~1! in the absence of driving; on the\nother hand, if we generalize Eq. ~1! to include the possibility\nof a periodic driving force, R will diverge to infinity at f\n5 f D on account of the d function in the power spectrum at\nthe driving frequency @3,6,7#, as can be seen from Eq. ~2!. It\nis therefore unclear to us just what is meant by the SNR in\nSec. V and, in particular, what is being plotted in Fig. 7. The\ngeneral trend of the results looks interesting, however, and\ncould with advantage be clarified by the authors of @1#. Their\nresearch will then become more useful to other scientists.\nWe should perhaps mention two other minor inconsisten-\ncies in the paper that are liable to mar its understandability.\nThe first relates to confusion between the frequency ~recip-\nrocal of the period! and the angular or cyclic frequency @9#\n~frequency multiplied by 2p): it is obvious from Figs. 1\u20135\nand from Eq. ~4! that f means the frequency @cf. also f D in\nEq. ~1!#; but, it follows from the formulas for f 0 and f 1, just\nbelow Eq. ~2! and two lines below Eq. ~3!, respectively, that\nf in Eqs. ~2! and ~3! means the angular frequency. Another\ninconsistency ~or, possibly, a misprint! occurs in the formula\nfor the angular frequency of the antisymmetric mode f 1: the\nmultiplier of k should be 2 rather than 3.\nWe end with two forward-looking comments. First, we\nsuggest that it would probably be fruitful to apply the central\nidea of @1# to an array of zero-dispersion ~ZD! @3,10,11,12#\noscillators. Unlike conventional oscillators ~e.g., the Duffing\noscillator as in @1#!, the dependence of the frequency of\neigenoscillation of a ZD oscillator on its energy, v(E), pos-\nsesses one or more extrema, i.e., there are one or more en-\nergies at which dv\/dE50. This property provides a very\nstrong enhancement of resonant behavior in the vicinity of\nthe extrema. Manifestations of SR phenomena are therefore\nmuch stronger than in conventional oscillators, and the maxi-\nmum noise-induced increase of the response ~signal! can be1-2\nCOMMENTS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 013101 ~2002!far larger ~cf. @2#!. Moreover, in contrast to the conventional\ncase, not only may the signal itself increase with noise inten-\nsity, but even the SNR, conventionally defined by ~5!, may\nundergo significant noise-induced growth @3,12#. Given that\nan array of zero-dispersion oscillators provides for the pos-\nsibility of their synchronization, manifestations of SR in an\narray of ZD oscillators may be expected to be even stronger\nthan in a single ZD oscillator ~such a hypothesis was sug-\ngested first in @12#!. It also seems very likely that, as in @1#,\nthe coupling will further increase the number of noise inten-\nsities at which the SNR exhibits local maxima @13#. There is\na wide variety of ZD oscillators. They may be either\nmonostable @e.g., the tilted Duffing oscillator @3,11# or a\nSQUID ~superconducting quantum interference device! loop\nwith a large inductance @12## or multistable ~e.g., a SQUID\nloop with a small inductance @12#!.\nFinally, we comment on a different generalization of the\ncentral idea of Lindner et al. @1#. If their aim is to increase01310the number of ranges of noise intensity where weak SR oc-\ncurs @i.e., where the signal, but not the SNR ~5!, possesses a\nlocal maximum as a function of noise intensity#, then one\nmay seek this phenomenon in any nonlinear dynamical sys-\ntem of high but finite dimension. In effect, Lindner et al.\nincreased the number of eigenmodes through the coupling in\nthe array: together with the shift of the maxima in the power\nspectrum as noise varies, this provided for multiple SRs. But,\nquite generally, any nonlinear dynamical system of high di-\nmension possesses many eigenmodes; the maxima in its\npower spectrum may be sensitive to noise intensity, and there\nis thus the possibility of multiple SRs as in @1#.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge illuminating correspon-\ndence with J.
