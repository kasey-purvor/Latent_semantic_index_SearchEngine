Teachers and administrators who support LANs cite economics, more\nefficient and effective use of computer resources, easier management of software and overall\nease-of-use as some of the major advantages (Reinhold 1989). However (and unfortunately),\nthe use of networked microcomputers in schools continues to reflect a 'one-station, one-user'\napproach, especially when viewed from the perspective of the integration of teaching models\nand technology. That is, a LAN is for the most part considered to be a system of connected,\nsingle-CPUs that have access to shared resources rather than a powerful platform that can\nattend to individual learning styles and abilities and preferred teaching models and accom-\npanying strategies. Recent advances in operating system functionality have opened the door to\na potentially innovative and exciting melding of teaching models and network technology.\nCurrent applications of school-based LANs\nPresently, most school-based LANs facilitate what would normally be done on a stand-alone\ncomputer (Vernot 1989; Reinhold 1989). For example, after working through the procedure to\ngain access to the network (logging on), students proceed to carry out some task such as using\nan application program (word processor, database program), programming, using electronic\nmail or account housekeeping.\n4\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nAlthough these LAN-related activities in schools are primarily single-user in nature, some\nvery innovative instruction has resulted. Thrush and Hardisty (1988) describe how LANs can\nfacilitate the writing process by providing the writer with access to centralized databases,\ncommon files and other users. With respect to the teaching of writing, Thrush and Hardisty\nprovide many practical suggestions for teachers and students. These include having a specific\nfile which contains ideas for writing topics. This file can be browsed or added to by any\nstudent. They also propose a system of allowing copies of student composition files* to be\nposted and to be read and electronically commented on by others. Another suggestion in-\nvolves the writing of 'shared' stories by having students write collaboratively in small groups\non the same topic or in the same style (narrative, expository).\nElectronic forums have also been successfully used to enhance user communication on a\nLAN. These forums are topical message areas available to any user where students can read\nand respond to the comments of others. The advantage of this type of interaction is that each\nparticipant has the same access and limitations that other users have. This equality is not as\neasily attainable in other situations. The electronic environment removes any biases that\nmight influence involvement in oral discussions and provides even the most reticent student\nwith the same opportunity for participation. Bump (1990) found that students who were able\nto participate in what he termed Computer-Assisted Class Discussion preferred this to face-to-\nface interaction. Furthermore, Bump found that synchronous communication (users communi-\ncating online simultaneously) was preferred by regular LAN users to asynchronous communi-\ncation (for example, electronic mail). However, his research also indicates that there may be a\ntendency for students to write messages on the computer that are more direct and pointed than\nwould be the norm in ordinary conversation, and that this can often result in a confrontational\nstyle.\nLANs have also been used to provide for more specific and guided user activities. For exam-\nple, one school in Southern California uses a LAN, authoring software and a library database\nto facilitate the writing of research reports and papers (Dezell 1991). Via a HyperCard stack\nand an online library database, students are guided through the steps of formulating research\nquestions, making an outline, locating library resources that relate to the topic, and determin-\ning whether or not these materials are currently available from the library.\nSkor (1988) discusses a scenario in which a LAN is used as an integral part of a grade 11\nPhysics programme. Information about class topics and daily assignments are posted fpr\nstudents. Answering of preliminary lab questions is completed on the LAN using a word\nprocessor which may take several days but which can be done from a variety of locations\nwithin the school. A spreadsheet program is used to collect the data and perform necessary\ncalculations, and the word processor is used again to compose the lab report. Additional\ninformation is available to the students through the use of an extensive physics database. The\nend product is submitted electronically to the instructor and the results are returned to the\nstudents in the same manner.\nHaving recognized the proliferation of LANs in schools, network products are being marketed\nspecifically for use in school settings in order to make the maintenance and operation of a \u2022\nnetwork less troublesome. One such product, IBM's ICLAS (IBM Classroom LAN Adminis-\ntration System), provides a network interface which allows for five levels of users: generic\nusers, students, teachers, a network administrator and a system operator. With ICLAS, a\nteacher can quickly and easily provide a student or a group of students access rights to certain\napplications or files and allow them to have read\/write privileges to selected directories on the\n5\nTom Jones and Brant Parker Teaching models and local-area networks\nfile server. Thus a teacher can place students into groups or classes and create user menus\nwhich list applications that are available to each group. The teacher can optionally create a\nstudent directory on the server which will become the default location where files will be\nsaved, or assign the workstation's local drive as the default. In addition, ICLAS will also\npermit teachers to control whether or not students are able to send messages and interact in\nreal time with other students and\/or teachers who are using the network, or to any other user\nvia electronic mail. Products like ICLAS go a long way to making a network an attractive\nteaching resource.\nIn the near future, local-area and wide-area networking technology (LAN, WAN) will give\nstudents access to information that might be located in the same room (for example, common\ndatafiles), in the same building (for example, network CD-ROM) or even in other countries.\nBecause the communication infrastructure provided by networking technology rapidly\nhandles the transfer of data, there exists great potential for interactivity between the classroom\nand the information source.\nWith emerging standards in layered networking protocols (for example, the Integrated Serv-\nices Digital Network (ISDN)), teachers will be able toprovide students with access to infor-\nmation in a variety of formats: text, graphics, digitized and compressed video, and digitized\nsound (Madron 1990). The information source may be a centralized database (for example,\nCD ROM), shared datafiles, synchronous communication between users (electronic confer-\nencing), asynchronous communication (electronic mail), or remote access to online informa-\ntion systems. Indeed, future wide-area networks will allow for students to collect information\non a topic by accessing simultaneously various information sources - both local and global -\non the network. This could be made possible by means of a software 'gopher' which would\nuse student-defined keywords, graphical cues, or other information discriminators to search\nsystematically each source for the specified information. In this way, students could retrieve\ninformation from a number of external sources.\nHowever, even with these software and hardware advances, the power and functionality of\nLANs have been primarily used to provide supplemental support for teachers and students.\nThat is, the use of LANs in educational settings has resembled more a business model than a\nmodel that reflects a consideration of teaching models and the concomitant strategies.\nAlthough the advances in centralized and distributed computing have been remarkable, they\nhave yet to be exploited in a manner that will allow teachers to teach some curricular content\nin a particular manner for a particular group of students - that is, match a teaching model with\nthe individual characteristics of the learner. Traditional educational software (CAI, drill and\npractice programs, simulations, educational games) have not been designed to accommodate\ndifferent teaching styles for the most part, but rather to be used by the individual learner or by\na teacher who can creatively work the software into the overall instructional program. This\ncan be effective but it is rather like putting the cart before the horse.\nOn a broader scale, many educators have concluded that computers do not necessarily provide\nthe enhancements to learning that were promised in the early 1980s (Skor 1988), although it\nshould be pointed out that there has been some success (Roblyer 1988). Rather, a decade of\nexperience has shown that the educational benefits of computers have resulted from the\nmanner in which the technology has been applied by teachers and students (Knapp 1989;\nCollins 1991). Educators have concluded that the more closely the application of the tech-\nnology complements the teaching and learning styles, the greater the impact on learning\n(Migliorelli 1987; Tesler 1991).\n6\nAlT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nFigure 1: Integration\nof teaching models\nand technology\nTeachinq Models\nInformation Processing Model\n- Concept attainment\n-Inductive thinking\n- Advance organizers\n-Developmental\nPersonal Models\n\u2022SynecBcs\nSocial Models\n- Group investigation\n- Role playing\n- Sodal science inquiry\nBehavioral Models\n-Mastery learning\n- Simulations\n-Behavior Modification\nCurriculum\nContent <-\nTechnology\nUANJ\nWhat is needed, then, is a different approach to the use of technology in schools, one which\nattends first to the teaching model that the teacher wishes to employ for a certain instructional\nunit or event, and one which also can be adapted to the different abilities and interests of the\nlearner. Interestingly, the latest advances in LAN technology can now support the demands\nthat would be placed on a school-based LAN if the approach delineated above and fleshed-out\nbelow were to be implemented. Teaching and learning that is supported by technology not\nadapted to technology is now possible.\nTeaching models and LANs\nIf the previous attempts to integrate technology into the curriculum have been only partially\nsuccessful, what approach should be taken and what role do local-area networks play? One\nanswer is to start from the pedagogical viewpoint (that is, teaching and learning), and then to\ndetermine how a LAN might provide a powerful resource in which teachers and students will\nbe able to carry out activities which are not possible in a LAN-less classroom. In their seminal\nbook, Joyce and Weil (1986) discuss 20 approaches to teaching and learning and the underly-\ning theories. These models describe approaches that range from didactic to constructivistic,\nfrom structured to non-structured, and from teacher-directed to student-directed. Joyce and\nWeil group these approaches into four broad categories or 'families of models': information\nprocessing models, personal models, social models, and behavioural systems models.\nA close look at each model within the four families reveals that not all readily lend them-\nselves to a match with instructional technology (see Joyce and Weil for details). The models\nthat do, however, are presented in Figure 1, and a short description of each model's main\nthesis is given in Appendix A. The point is that this innovative approach will address the\nbringing together of three factors: the teaching model, the curricular content and a local-area\nnetwork.\nWhat teacher would not like to have the option of planning a unit on a topic (for example,\ntrial balance) and have at his or her fingertips a means by which the instruction could be made\nto reflect an appropriate teaching model listed in Figure 1? For instance, one teacher might\nprefer to have the students first achieve fluency (mastery learning) in the terms which des-\ncribe the\" report (assets, liabilities, equity, etc.), then move on to a presentation (advance\norganizers) of sample trial balances, and finally to run a simulation of a small business in\nwhich the goal is to come up with a trial balance (simulations).\n7\nTom Jones and Brant Parker Teaching models and local-area networks\nThis could well be followed by some activities on the part of the students, and followed up\nwith a brainstorming session on how to prepare a trial balance for easy comprehension\n(synectics). Underlying these activities might be a desire on the part of the teacher to ensure\nthat no one student is left out and that some remediation can be provided to a certain number\nof students who are not able to carry the necessary operations at a rate commensurate with the\nother students (behaviour modification). Another teacher might wish to provide instruction on\nthe trial balance by presenting the students with the results of a series of journal entries, and\nthen leading them toward the concept (and its concrete counterpart) of a summary statement\n(inductive thinking and concept attainment).\nNumerous examples could be generated along these lines, but the question would remain\nabout the feasibility of being able to teach some content using one or a number of these\nmodels. Are teachers able to do this now? The answer is perhaps: a little, but not as much as\nthey would like, and it would definitely take a great deal of time and effort even if it were\npossible. One solution is to structure the curricular content and its subsequent delivery in a\nway that it lends itself (at least to a large extent) to being run on a classroom-based LAN.\nInherent in this is the necessity to re-fashion the subject matter so that it can be moved to an\nelectronic medium. This is no small concern, but it should also be noted that use of a LAN as\nan integral if not central component in a course of studies will also open up the classroom to\nother sources of information (see above), and these other sources can provide unique opportu-\nnities for the teacher and students.\nAt the core of an implementation along these lines is a recognition that the traditional manner\nin which a curriculum is developed must change. In particular, after decisions have been made\nabout goals and learning objectives, a great deal of attention will have to be paid to how\nvarious topics will be treated vis-a-vis the teaching models. For example, if it is decided that\nthe overall model will provide for a group investigation, then the options for dividing the\nFirst Settlers on the Prairies\nPlanners\/problem-solvers\nArtists\/designers\nFigure 2: Group learning\nexample\n8\nAur-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nstudents into groups must be pre-determined. Also the nature of the tools that will be available\nto each group will also have to be commensurate with that group's contribution. In any event,\nthe driver for these types of decisions when developing the curriculum will be the content\nitself. The ideal, of course, would be a curricular structure which would allow for a maximal\ncrossing of the teaching models and the course topics.\nExample\nTo provide a classroom-based example of how these ideas might be implemented, imagine a\ntypical (North American) grade 7 class (teacher and students) who are beginning a unit on the\nsettling of the prairies. Without going into detail about how this event took place, let us take a\nlook at how a teacher who is teaching this unit and who has decided on a 'group investiga-\ntion' model might take advantage of a LAN.\nSet-up\nThe LAN would initially be configured by assigning students to groups (Figure 2). As part of\nthe unit set-up, the teacher could allocate the stations in such a manner as to match the\ngroups' tasks and tools with the strengths of each of the students. In this example, there might\nbe provision for a maximum of six groups (planners\/problem solvers, archivists\/linguists,\nmathematicians, scouts, cooks and designers\/engineers).\nThe teacher may decide that all six groups should be used, and that the 30 or so students in his\nor her classroom can be appropriately placed. This calls for an in-depth knowledge of a .\nnumber of factors which impact on learning - past achievement, level of mastery in required\nareas, group dynamics, motivation, preferences - and a detailed profile of how the students\nfare on these factors. In other words, the membership of the groups (and note that not all six\nhave to be assigned) is controlled directly by the teacher and should result in the most effec-\ntive matching of required skill and student expertise.\nGroup tools\nOnce the make-up of the groups has been determined, each group would be given access to\nthat group's tools - that is, the programs they will be using (Figure 3). The planners\/problem-\nsolvers would be supplied with information about the ultimate goal of the unit (for example,\nsettling in some western locale), an overall inventory of the group's resources, a decision-\nmaking program and an updated database. The archivists\/linguists would be responsible for\nmaintaining an accurate record of the pioneers' day-to-day efforts, for interpreting the records\nof previous explorers and for the translation and interpretation of communications between\nthe settlers and the natives.\nThis group would have access to a text editor, a separate database or compendium of earlier\nexplorers' records, and a visual database of native ideographic writings. The mathematicians,\nas might be expected, would carry out the necessary calculations required by any of the other\ngroups. Their tools would be a calculator and spreadsheet-like software which would provide\nfor what-if? questions. The scouts would have at their disposal maps of varying degrees of\naccuracy and completeness. The nutritionists would be charged with the acquisition, prepara-\ntion and preservation of food. The designers\/engineers would be required to design (and to\nmodify, if necessary) the means of transportation, and to design and build temporary struc-\ntures (huts, bridges, rafts).\n9\nTom Jones and Brant Parker Teaching models and local-area networks\nInter-group communication\nA unique and very powerful feature of establishing groups as described above is that although\neach group will have its unique tools, responsibilities and activities, all the groups will have\nto interact in order to acquire pertinent information for their own activities and decision-\nmaking. For example, the planners\/problem solvers will have to maintain close contact with\nthe scouts when the settlers are about to break camp and enter unknown territory. The infor-\nmation they will need may be visual (a first-time map of a region), textual (written descrip-\ntions of up-coming terrain or obstacles) and perhaps auditory (sound of waterfalls\/rapids).\nThey will also require updates from each of the other groups and will either request them or\nacknowledge them when they are available. The mathematicians in this instance might be\ngiving assistance to a number of the other groups. Based on what information the scouts have\nprovided to the planners\/problem solvers, this group could be asked by the designers to work\nout the number of days it will take for the settlers to reach a particular destination. The cooks,\nafter having decided on what food will be available, might request the mathematicians to\ndetermine how much fuel will be required in order to prepare the food. The archivists\/\nlinguists might query the scouts about the natives who were encountered in order to determine\nwhich native language will be used for communication.\nNote that the results of each group's decisions, calculations or designs would have an immedi-\nate effect on the central database (and updated on each group's screen), and would be acces-\nsible by each group as input for further group activities. Note also that the information shared\namong groups may be textual, visual (still frame or full-motion video) and auditory.\nTeaching models\nDuring all this activity, the teacher would have a great deal of control over what transpires. In\nparticular, the teacher would be able to alter instructional events, based on the teaching\nmodels described above, with each of the groups so that the members might acquire the\nlearning objectives of the curriculum while contributing to the unit goal - that is, moving the\nsettlers westward. Thus, the teacher might be aware that the scouts are lacking the concept of\na map legend and the skill of interpreting various markings. This group would then be pre-\nsented with information on legends (concept attainment), given opportunities to demonstrate\nmastery of these concepts (mastery learning), and perhaps individual members of the group\nwould be required to work a while longer until mastery is achieved (behaviour modification).\nFor another group, the mathematicians, it may arise that they need certain formulae (for\nexample, rate x distance) in order to compute distances to be travelled. The teacher in this\ninstance might apply an inductive thinking model by presenting to the group a number of\nexamples which call for predicting a final answer. The examples could include data which has\nto be generated by the group.\nWhat is being argued for here is the ability for a teacher to control how content is delivered\n(in other words, which model) to each group based on that group's learning characteristics.\nRealistically, not all models will be covered for each instructional event; the onus will be on\nthe curriculum designers to decide which sub-topics of the content lend themselves to which\nmodel, and which of these sub-topics are amenable to being developed for a LAN. It should\nalso be emphasized that if the type of system being described were to be implemented, it does\nnot preclude the introduction of offline activities. In fact, designing a curriculum with no\nprovision for such activities would restrict a teacher's options and would not be recom-\nmended.\n10\nAlT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nFigure 3: Group tools\nFirst Settlers on the Prairies\n| Query\/update\nInventory Map\n| Query\/update |\nArtists\/designers\nPlanners\/problem-solvers\nQuery\/update\nEditor \\\nArchivists\/linguists\n| Query\/update\n8151\nMathematicians\nMaster console\n(teacher)\nCommon data-base\nQuery\/update |\nInventory Recipes\nNutritionists\nQuery\/update\nMap\nScouts\nImplementation\nIs it possible to implement these ideas given the state of today's technology? It appears so.\nWhat is required is a peer-to-peer network which includes a single file-, print- and communi-\ncations-server (preferably with a fast CPU and, more importantly, fast disk access) and a\nnumber of clients (emphasis on the mastery learning model would call for more stations than\nemphasis on the group investigation model). The server, over and above providing for access\nto shared resources - printers, CD-ROM, modems, video sources - , will also turn full duty as\na database server given that all clients (workstations) will be reading and writing to a common\ndatabase (Figures 2 and 3) which will provide the teacher and all students with a 'latest'\nversion of their progress. Because individual clients will possibly need to multitask, a good\nchoice for network software would be either Novell's Netware or 3Com's LAN Manager\nrunning over OS\/2. None of these are suggestions that reflect low-end computing (and the\nmatter of client software has not yet been addressed), but it will be obvious that what has been\noutlined in this paper calls for a major revamping of how instruction and technology are\nintegrated.\nSummary\nThe object of this paper has been to consider an approach for the integration of (a) various\ncommonly-held approaches to teaching (models) with (b) a sophisticated, computer-based\nresource as the vehicle for delivery. The rationale for such a plan has been to provide teachers\nand learners with an effective, powerful and flexible tool for both instruction and learning.\nCan it be implemented? We believe so, given that LAN technology has matured to the point\nwhere such a resource could be developed. Does it put the horse (pedagogy) before the cart\n(technology)? We think so.\n11\nTom Jones and Brant Parker Teaching models and local-area networks\nAppendix A: Teaching Models\nInformation-processing models\nThe information processing family of models encompasses those which are primarily con-\ncerned with the acquisition of new knowledge, testing of this knowledge, collecting and\norganizing data, and\/or developing an awareness and understanding of problems and arriving\nat solutions. The central tenets of these models are as follows:\n\u2022 concept attainment: an effective method for organizing information and for learning\nconcepts;\n\u2022 inductive thinking: how to find and organize information and creating and testing\nhypotheses;\n\u2022 advance organizers: provides a cognitive structure for comprehending material;\n\u2022 developmental model: the goal is to match instruction with the learner's level of\ncognitive ability.\nPersonal models of teaching\nModels grouped into the personal family are those which revolve around the individual and\nhis or her experiences. The emphasis in these models is on the perspective and knowledge a\nperson acquires through his or her own actions and interactions with others. Unlike their\ninformation processing counterparts, the main goal of these models is not to improve indi-\nviduals' cognitive skill which assists them in acquiring new information. Rather, personal\napproaches aim at improving the individual learner's self-concept, confidence, effectiveness,\nwhile helping the individual construct his or her own understanding and knowledge. They\nchallenge individuals to assume responsibility for their own learning and to extend the limits\nof their own understanding.\nSynectics: teaches collaborative problem-solving to result in new, creative perspec-\ntives.\nSocial models of teaching\nThe social family of models consists of those which are primarily based on group work and\nsocial interaction. That is, the models operate on the social processes found in group and\ncollaborative learning environments. These co-operative settings, and the group dynamics that\nare prevalent within them, provide a means by which social growth is fostered and new\nknowledge, skills, and shared or negotiated understandings are acquired.\nGroup investigation: application of the principles of the democratic process to\nencourage group members to construct new knowledge;\nRole playing: situations are presented to students who act out a problematic situation\nand then analyse it;\nSocial science inquiry: defining a problem, testing hypotheses, gathering data and\nmaking generalizations. \u2022\nBehavioural systems models of teaching\nThe behavioural systems models are built on the premise that learning can occur through\nfeedback received in response to one's actions. The approaches are largely founded on the\nwork of classical conditioning theorists, and are based on a stimulus-response-reinforcement\n12\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nmodel. In these approaches, large tasks are broken down into smaller behaviours. The feed-\nback provided to the learner is the primary means by which observable behaviours are either\nrepeated or modified.\nMastery learning: individualized learning of highly stratified skills and concepts;\nSimulations: principles of cybernetics are applied to learning environments;\nBehaviour modification: learning occurs as a result of the manipulation of the envi-\nronment.\nReferences\nBump, J.
