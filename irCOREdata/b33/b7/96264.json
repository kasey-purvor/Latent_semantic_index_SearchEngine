But this would take us too far from the focus of this paper which is on interdisciplinarity. 11 We are not conflating the two concepts here, but depending on the discipline, they can have reciprocal roles. For example, within the objectivist epistemology of physics we can accommodate different disciplines such as chemistry and various branches  of  engineering.  By  contrast,  within  social  science  as  a  disciplinary  domain  we  can  accommodate  different epistemologies (objectivism of mainstream economics, phenomenology, social constructivism, etc). 12 The shifting nature or perception of software between \u2018linguistic artefact\u2019 and \u2018machine\u2019 is well reflected in the differences between how software as intellectual property is addressed in Europe where it is mainly protected by copyright vs. the US, where it is protected by patents. 13 See http:\/\/evesim.org\/ 14  Using  the  definition  of  these  terms  we  have  proposed,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  people  from  the  sciences  tend automatically to aim for unification, whereas people from the social sciences as a rule have more modest aims towards integration. We think this is a consequence of the different levels of awareness in these two disciplinary domains of questions of epistemology. In the sciences and engineering \u2018life is easy\u2019 since physics provides good answers for most \u2018fundamental\u2019 questions. In the social sciences, researchers have become used to proceeding with caution.","cites":null},{"id":17286416,"title":"Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living.","authors":[],"date":"1980","doi":"10.1007\/978-94-009-8947-4_9","raw":"Maturana, Humberto and Varela, Francisco. 1980.

The four-year \u20ac9.1 million project was \ncomprised of a consortium of 20 partners from across the world and was led by the London School of \nEconomics and Political Science. Its overarching research aim was to develop a theoretical foundation \nfor \u2018digital ecosystems\u2019 research. \n \nThe community of projects and researchers that emerged around the concept of digital ecosystems \n(DEs), introduced by the EC in 2002 (Nachira 2002), consistently held the view that DEs have the \npotential to become a significant part of the next generation of information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) and Internet usage.1 Although applicable in many contexts, from the perspective of \nOPAALS researchers, DEs may have the greatest potential in enabling small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) to compete on the global stage. Based on open, peer-to-peer architectures and open \nsource software (OSS), digital ecosystems integrate trends in the technical, social, and economic \naspects of the networked world. As well as pursuing the development of the science and technology \nfeatures of digital ecosystems, the OPAALS project integrated a focus on the social, cultural and \npolicy implications of this new mode of organising distributed architectures and online environments \nfor collaborative research into its research agenda. \n \nAs is evident from this brief description of the research aims of OPAALS, a variety of disciplinary \nperspectives and scientific methods was required to work towards and partly reach these ends. The \nproject consortium was comprised of experts from disciplines as diverse as biology (from which the \nmetaphor of the ecosystem originates), mathematics, physics, engineering, the social sciences \n(including media and communications, information systems, management, sociology, and some \nbranches of economics), linguistics and, of course, computer science. The ethos of interdisciplinarity \nand the pragmatism of multi-disciplinarity were thus present from the very origins of the project, as \nreflected in the multi-faceted definitions shown in Table 1. \n \nAn Associative Autopoietic Digital Ecosystem is\u2026 \nSocial Science Computer Science Natural Science \n\u2022 A community of users \n\u2022 A shared set of languages and \ncollaborative practices \n\u2022 A self-reinforcing set of regulatory \nnorms and guidelines to foster trust \n\u2022 A set of knowledge and business \nservices \n\u2022 An economically sustainable \nopen-source service-oriented \ninfrastructure \n\u2022 A governance framework \n\u2022 Several categories of users \n\u2022 A set of formal languages \n\u2022 A distributed security, identity, \naccountability and trust infrastructure \n\u2022 A service-oriented architecture based \non a distributed transaction \ncoordination model \n\u2022 A service development environment \n\u2022 A distributed persistent storage layer \n\u2022 A dynamic P2P run-time \nenvironment \n\u2022 A population of interacting \nagents \n\u2022 A distributed evolutionary \nenvironment \n\u2022 A dynamic, adaptive, \nlearning and scale-free \nnetwork infrastructure \n\u2022 An operationally closed and \nself-organising set of \ninteracting multifunctional \nautomata \n \nTable 1: Multiple perspectives on digital ecosystems \n \nWhereas the above table is subjectivist\/individualist in character, in that it lists the different ways in \nwhich DEs are perceived by practitioners belonging to different disciplinary domains, a useful \ncomplementary perspective that is objectivist\/structuralist in character is one that asks what \nrequirements a socio-technical-economic system needs to satisfy to warrant being called a DE. This \nview suggests several propositions that underpin DE research: 1) ICTs lead to efficiency \nimprovements; 2) sustainable development is best achieved when the social dimension of economic \ninteractions is explicitly taken into account; 3) greater collaboration within a particular geographical \nregion or virtual community leads to sustainability of economic growth and enhances the \n 3 \ncompetitiveness of that region or online community; 4) DEs are best built on an open source \ninfrastructure; and 5) that infrastructure should be distributed. \n \nThese propositions are fundamental to DE research in the sense that: \n \nAll foundational systems need ultimately to assume the soundness of their \u2018axioms\u2019 and method of \nconstruction. \u2026 For knowledge to be possible, there must be some propositions which can be known \nwithout proof or evidence. These are [the] foundations of knowledge. (Hollis 1994: 68-69) \n \nIn the OPAALS project these starting hypotheses or propositions were foundational in the sense that \nthey motivated the search for a theory that would show how sustainable socio-economic development \nmay be associated with DEs. The exploration of these hypotheses was pursued through theoretical and \nempirical research over a number of years (e.g. Van Egeraat et al. 2008; Rivera-Le\u00f3n et al. \nforthcoming). In this paper, we are concerned with the process of development of an analytical \nframework through which practitioners in different disciplines can work together. This process \nfollowed an unplanned bottom-up path which required for its full expression an inclusive and safe \nenvironment of collaborative enquiry. \n \nInterdisciplinarity was thus neither a normative goal nor naturalised in the project: as part of a \nreflexive engagement with the work being done to (first) understand, design, and (ultimately) develop \ndigital ecosystems, it was understood that part of that task would entail the development of a \ntheoretical framework that could support the conceptualisation of an interdisciplinary ethos. OPAALS \nresearchers did not take interdisciplinarity for granted. The definition and attainment of research \nobjectives according to each discipline\u2019s respective priorities and principles of scholarship was \nregarded as a necessary step preceding any attempt at interdisciplinary integration. Integration was \nseen as a potential outcome of a bottom-up process of balancing between respecting disparate \nepistemological perspectives and recognising opportunities for new syntheses. \n \nBefore proceeding further, what we mean by \u2018integration\u2019 needs to be understood. If \u2018unification\u2019 is \nunderstood to imply considering two or more apparently unrelated phenomena within the same theory \nor model, then \u2018integration\u2019 is understood here to enable different theories to coexist with a degree of \ncompatibility that does not imply that the same theoretical foundation underpins them. An example of \nthe former is electricity and magnetism which were thought to be different physical phenomena until a \nsingle set of equations was derived by Maxwell (1873). An example of the latter is the understanding \nof computers as media of communications, rooted ultimately in Heidegger\u2019s phenomenology, sitting \nside-by-side with the understanding of computers as machines operating on objective data and whose \nfunctions can be optimised (Winograd and Flores 1987). The experience of the OPAALS projects \nsuggests the greater feasibility of integrating rather than unifying different disciplines. \n \nThe OPAALS project aimed, in part, to interrogate the strengths and weaknesses of interdisciplinary \nperspectives. In this paper, we explain the elements of the theoretical framework developed for \nunderstanding DEs and what was learned about the feasibility of this approach.2 To develop this \nexplanation we draw insights particularly from theories concerned with communication processes and \npower relationships. Our understanding of interdisciplinary integration evokes a longstanding \nobservation in the field of communication research: \n \nWe sometimes forget that communication research is a field, not a discipline. In the study of man, it is \none of the great crossroads where many pass but few tarry. Scholars come into it from their own \ndisciplines, bringing valuable tools and insights, and later go back, like Lasswell, to the more central \nconcerns of their disciplines. (Schramm 1959, in Berelson 1959) \n \nAs suggested by this quotation, there are many difficulties in communicating across disciplinary \nboundaries which are attributable in part to the plurality of voices that have an \u2018inhibiting effect\u2019 on \nthe construction of \u2018global, totalitarian theories\u2019 (Foucault 1980: 80), a theme that we return to later in \nthis paper. \n \n 4 \nAlthough we discuss certain epistemological questions in some depth, we do so unevenly, privileging \nsocial science over the epistemologies of mathematics, biology, computer science, or physics. Our \nmain objective is to report on the learning process which led us to contend with epistemological \nquestions while addressing the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration, rather than to develop an \nextensive discussion of the epistemology of science. Learning theory (e.g. Vygotsky 1978) has been \nused in analysing the process of ICT development (Millar 1996). However, in this  paper the principal \nconcern is with the lessons learned specifically from our critical reflection on the experience of \nengaging with inter-epistemological challenges. \n \nThe paper is organised as follows. First, we provide a description of the areas of DE research \nprioritised by each of the disciplines involved in the OPAALS project. Second, we reflect on \nchallenging questions of epistemology that arose in the context of developing interdisciplinary \nresearch and offer a summary of how these were dealt with in order to outline a theoretical framework \nfor understanding DEs by the end of the project. Finally, we outline some of the outcomes of the work \nundertaken in the project and discuss the lessons from this experience. We argue that while it is \nimpossible to develop a unified interdisciplinary theoretical framework due to irreconcilable \nepistemological differences, it is possible and worthwhile for those adhering to various disciplinary \nperspectives to work together to contribute to the achievement of a practical joint endeavour, a lesson \nwith broader relevance to other interdisciplinary research communities. \n \n \nOPAALS\u2019S INTERDISCIPLINARITY \n \nThe development of a theoretical foundation for understanding DEs from the outset of the OPAALS \nproject was conceptualised as a problem requiring an interdisciplinary solution, partly because of the \nmultiple possible meanings ascribed to the term \u2018ecosystem\u2019. The concept of the \u2018business ecosystem\u2019 \n(Moore, 1996), uses \u2018ecosystem\u2019 as a metaphor to capture the dynamic interactions between socio-\neconomic agents and actors. The presence of the word \u2018digital\u2019 in \u2018digital ecosystem\u2019, however, opens \nthe possibility of interpreting \u2018ecosystem\u2019 as a model that can serve as inspiration for the development \nof software systems that self-organise and for software services and applications that emerge \nspontaneously from an artificial life-like environment. We refer to the field that studies the latter as \nbiologically-inspired computing, or bio-computing. \n \n \nDomains and territories \n \nOne of the central research goals of OPAALS was to build an interdisciplinary community that would \nenable those adhering to various disciplines to engage with research questions related to DEs from \ntheir respective points of view. The work of OPAALS entailed the encouragement of a spontaneous \nconvergence of these perspectives over time partly through the development of a common language \naimed at solving shared research problems (Dini et al. 2008a: 9). This required communication \nstrategies to support and underpin interdisciplinary collaboration as well as an acknowledgement of a \ndiscursive view of knowledge construction. From a discursive perspective, knowledge is \nconceptualised as emerging from scientific practice which is, in turn, shaped by political, social, \ncultural and disciplinary pressures. Scientific discourses are understood as practises \u2018that \nsystematically form the objects of which they speak\u2019 (Foucault 1969: 54). The disciplinary scientific \ndiscourses engaged in the project of constructing knowledge about DEs produce such knowledge \nthrough their practices of research. In this sense, knowledge can be conceptualised as discursively \nself-forming or evolving over time, a process which takes shape in language (Dini et al. 2009: 13). \nThis understanding was most evident within the social science domains of the project, although (as \nwill be discussed) it became increasingly evident in the natural and computer science domains as the \nresearch progressed. \n \n 5 \nThe interaction of the natural science, computer science and social science disciplines in OPAALS \nresearch is visualised in Figure 1, which was created at the beginning of the project and played an \nimportant role in fostering the structure of interdisciplinary interactions from the outset. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Interdisciplinary structure of OPAALS research \n \n \nThe central position in this figure of computer science is due to the fact that computers can be seen \nfrom two ontological points of view.3 The first and older conception sees computers as machines that \nare understood through a functionalist epistemology in which the optimisation of performance is the \nmain focus. The second, now more widely accepted, view sees computers as media of communication \nthat are integrated into the social (Winograd and Flores 1987). The functionalist perspective is \nappropriate for the research agenda in bio-computing, whereas the interpretation of computers as \nmedia of communication fits better with a social perspective on socio-economic agency, which \ninformed part of the project\u2019s epistemology.  The applied computer science domain was positioned at \nthe interface of the social and natural science domains within the OPAALS project. The objectives of \neach domain\u2019s approach to DE research are summarised next. \n \n \nNatural Science  \n \nFrom a natural science perspective, the research agenda of OPAALS was tied to the fundamental \nquestion of whether a biological ecosystem could be used as a model for the development of a \nsoftware architecture that could sustain the self-organisation of software artefacts. \n \nThis research question is premised on the assumption that such biological properties can \nincrease the effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in \nvarious application domains, from ubiquitous computing, to autonomic communications, \nto socio-economic processes aimed at regional development, simply on the basis of their \ngreater and spontaneous adaptability to user needs (Dini and Schreckling 2010). \n \nThis question had been answered in the affirmative by an OPAALS forerunner, the Digital Business \n 6 \nEcosystem (DBE) project, in the form of a distributed evolutionary environment whose architecture \nwas defined and partly implemented during the course of that project (Briscoe and DeWilde 2005; \nHeistracher et al. 2006). Another outcome of the DBE project, however, was the realisation that an \nevolutionary environment was not sufficient to achieve ecosystemic behaviour in software, a \nconclusion that is echoed by some biologists. As discussed by Kauffman (1993), for example, \nevolution is not sufficient to explain the very powerful order construction processes and phenomena \nobserved in nature. Evolution constructs order through mutation, sexual mixing, and selection of \nhereditary traits across many generations and over very long periods of time, a process called \nphylogeny. The complement of evolutionary processes is embodied in cell metabolic processes, which \nconstruct order through biochemical interactions within the life of the individual organism, a process \ncalled ontogeny. The \u2018hinge\u2019 that connects phylogeny to ontogeny is the DNA molecule.4 \n \nFor this reason the natural scientists and mathematicians in the project consortium felt it was important \nto build a strong component of cell biology research into OPAALS and principally for this reason \nadopted autopoiesis (Maturana and Varela 1980, 1998) as a catch-all concept for representing \nprocesses by which systems, like the biological cell and, in particular, stem cells, can reproduce \nthemselves with the recursive ability to reproduce themselves being built into their blueprint.  \n \nNatural science DE research can be considered functionalist in that its aim is to improve the \nperformance properties of the software. This is an area that requires further research to achieve these \ngoals, although OPAALS\u2019s development of a theoretical framework for bio-computing (Dini and \nSchreckling 2010) connecting cell metabolism to algebraic automata theory and to specification \nlanguages through category theory, introducing the concept of Interaction Computing, contributed to \nthis outcome. \n \n \nComputer Science \n \nComputer science DE research addresses many facets of distributed software systems5 and of \nformal\/business modelling languages.6 Insofar as technology embodies cultural values (Feenberg \n1991, 2002) this calls for the assumption of responsibility on the part of technologists. The computer \nscientists of the DE community therefore elected to approach, and largely embrace, a normative \nrequirement of distributing every aspect of the architecture. A distributed architecture avoids single \npoints of failure, which is a functionalist value, but also single points of control, and therefore is more \nconsistent with a goal of encouraging competitive, rather than monopoly supply of services. \n \nThe realisation of distributed architectures for all aspects of the software system was a huge challenge \nfor OPAALS due to the need to reconcile two opposing requirements (Dini et al. 2008b; Razavi et al. \n2009). On the one hand, the (normative) requirement was to avoid single points of control and the \n(engineering) requirement was to avoid single points of failure. This called for a \u2018pure\u2019 peer-to-peer \narchitecture which is very inefficient for data and message propagation. On the other hand, the \n(functionalist) requirement for efficient data and message propagation called for a hierarchical \nnetwork, based on so-called \u2018super-peers\u2019 and this would violate the first requirement. \n \nThe solution was the concept of dynamic, virtual super-peers (DVSP): \u2018virtual\u2019 means that each super-\npeer is actually a collection of machines, whereas \u2018dynamic\u2019 refers to the fact that membership in the \ncluster of virtual super-peer machines is dependent on the resource availability of the participating \npeers. Furthermore, the owners of the servers do not know at what level in the hierarchy the machines \nare at any one point, and cannot, therefore, take advantage of their machine\u2019s privileged position when \nit is at the top. \n \nThe structure and configuration of this hierarchical and dynamic P2P network is also dependent on the \nrequirements for transaction robustness and recovery in the transaction model. The execution of a \ncomplex service that involves many individual web services located on different machines and at \ndifferent locations requires a transaction coordinator that can orchestrate the handover of the data from \n 7 \none service to the next, provide roll-back recovery in case of a failed step in the transaction, and \ngenerally ensure smooth and reliable operation of the overall service. In most web service scenarios, \nthis function is provided by a transaction coordination service running on a centralised transaction \nserver. In order to guarantee roll-back recovery, such servers require the participating companies to \nexpose the details of their business processes, which are stored on the central server (each state of the \ntransaction is stored, leading to a \u2018stateful\u2019 model). This creates an asymmetry of information about \nthe market which the owner of the transaction server can then exploit. \n \nTo offset this \u2018market failure\u2019 problem, the University of Surrey developed a distributed coordination \nservice (Virtual Private Transaction Network, VPTN) that eliminates the central server completely. \nThe distributed coordinator is composed of software agents that travel to the service end-points, \nrequest data from the relevant service through an agreed interface, and ensure local consistency of \nexecution. If a transaction step fails, the execution is rolled back to the previous step (not state) and \nthe necessary data is requested again through the agreed interfaces (thus this model is called \n\u2018stateless\u2019). \n \nThis P2P infrastructure was completed with a distributed identity model which does not rely on \nDomain Name Servers (DNS) (McLaughlin and Malone, 2010). From the point of view of identity, in \nfact, the DNS system can be regarded as a central point of control. Rather than being mapped to web \nUniversal Resource Locators (URLs) or Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs), the Internet Protocol \n(IP) addresses of a P2P digital ecosystem are mapped to personal identifiers that are known only \nwithin the network itself. As a consequence, a P2P DE is \u2018invisible\u2019 to the regular web, to search \nengines, etc. \n \n \nSocial Science \n \nFrom a social science perspective, DE research asked: what are the social, political and cultural \nprocesses required in order to achieve sustainable socio-economic development enabled by the science \nand technology? The social science element of DE research was based on an understanding of the \nrelationship between bottom-up processes and the structural principles of socio-economic action. DE \nresearch entailed an engagement with questions of language, communication and community building \nat both the level of the individual and the collective, as well as an assessment of various social, \neconomic and political (in terms of community governance and policy implications) elements of the \nestablishment of DEs. \n \nIn this context, issues were highlighted regarding the policy perspective on DE adoption on the \nregional scale as well as areas of theoretical debate that opened up from there, culminating in the \n\u2018primary\u2019 concepts of open knowledge, power, control, and democratic process. These informed the \ndesign principles for the DE architecture explained above (no single point of control\/failure, diversity, \nreliability, distribution), leading to what we argue was a satisfactory integration of the computer and \nsocial science domains at both theoretical and practical levels (Moschoyiannis et al. 2008). Indeed, as \nCrone and Br\u00e4uer (2007) discuss, research relating to ICT and socio-economic change is \ninterdisciplinary by its very nature. In OPAALS, it was argued that technological and social issues \ninvolved in providing the necessary digital infrastructure should not be treated as distinct issues but \ninstead as part of the same continuum (Moschoyiannis et al. 2008). \n \nThe dialogue between the two domains enabled the project to \u2018process\u2019 the top-down, normative \nrequirements insisted upon by the European Commission that every aspect of the architecture had to \nbe distributed and that all software had to be Open Source. That is, to protect the integrity of scientific \nresearch it was important to re-examine independently these normative requirements. The result of the \nexercise was an informed decision to embrace the architectural criteria and Open Source properties of \nsoftware as starting assumptions for the project. \n \nWith multiple disciplinary perspectives on the process of defining DEs, it was clear that it would be \n 8 \nnecessary to work towards a theoretical framework that could hold all of these perspectives, but the \nachievement of this objective was fraught with difficulties. For example, whereas a satisfactory level \nof integration was achieved between computer science and social science, and very interesting \npossibilities emerged for the integration and even unification of computer science and natural science, \nthe integration of social science and natural science remained problematic, as we now explain. \n \n \nQUESTIONS OF EPISTEMOLOGY \n  \nThe above disparate research agendas suggest that a great deal of work would be required in terms of \nconceptualising and theorising interdisciplinary research and in actually doing it. Constant challenges \narose in enabling very different, and often completely incompatible, epistemologies and theoretical \ntraditions to engage with one another and to coexist within a theoretical framework that needed to be \napplicable to the entire project.7 Issues of communication among researchers were a key priority \u2013 but \nunderstanding was not possible unless epistemological differences could be acknowledged. Similar \nchallenges were experienced in DE research that pre-dated the OPAALS project. For example, in the \ncontext of the DBE project, Dini and Berdou (2004) argued that in order for dialogue to take place \nbetween the domains of social science and natural science, multiple approaches and agendas needed to \nbe acknowledged, certain barriers needed to be lifted and certain links needed to be made explicit. \nThis was not to suggest that epistemological and ontological questions needed to be settled in order for \ninterdisciplinary cooperation to take place, but it did imply that these differences would need to be \ntaken seriously in the successor project, OPAALS. \n \nAn interesting example of the problems of epistemology concerned the concept of autopoiesis, which \nappears in the title of the research project. The inclusion of the term was rooted in the research agenda \nof bio-computing, and inspired by the cognitive science developed by Maturana and Varela (1980, \n1998). The term also held appeal for social scientists as its relativist basis resonated with some aspects \nof phenomenology and social constructivism perspectives: \n \nMaturana\u2019s work represents a distinct advance on classical phenomenology, a major criticism of which is \nthat it is essentially individualist and has great difficulty in generating the intersubjective nature of social \nreality. Here Maturana begins from an intersubjective position. We are (as self-conscious beings) \nconstituted through our language, and language is inevitably an intersubjective phenomenon. As \nWittgenstein also argued, there can be no such thing as a private language. Thus language is essentially a \nconsensual domain of agreements, of structural coupling that permits the operations of observers. \n(Mingers 1995: 110) \n \nSimilarly, one of the core debates that characterised interdisciplinary research and dialogue within the \nOPAALS consortium from its inception was the relationship between agency and structure, that is, the \nrole of individual actors within a social scene and the collectively defined and managed structures of \nthese roles. Epistemological differences \u2013 are social systems constructed only through communication,  \nby human agency, language and action, or through relations of production? \u2013 were evident in the \nproject from the outset: \n \nWe have come to the realisation that the main challenge of the OPAALS project is not so much that it is a \ndeeply interdisciplinary research project but, more fundamentally, that it is an inter-epistemological \nresearch project\u2014and that it seeks to find constructive integrative solutions at theoretical and applied \nlevels that are relevant and useful to associative autopoietic digital ecosystems (Botto et al. 2008: 6). \n \nThe concept of autopoiesis has links to social systems theory, especially as developed by Luhmann \n(1995), who argued that social systems are built from recursive communications. This perspective \nexcises agency and individual hermeneutics and this was problematic for some social scientists \nworking in OPAALS. A possible solution was to add, at the proposal stage, the term \u2018associative\u2019 in \nthe title of OPAALS, before \u2018autopoietic\u2019, as a means of complementing and balancing the \n\u2018autopoietic\u2019 viewpoint by making the role of the individual social actor as explicitly central to the \nproject as a systemic conceptualisation of DEs. \n 9 \nA first attempt at an epistemological framework: Hollis\u2019s map \n \nDiffering epistemologies are most evident when comparing, for example, natural science and social \nscience, but they are also evident within the social sciences. A \u2018map of social science\u2019 proposed by \nHollis (1994) was used within the project to summarise the main analytical traditions in the social \nsciences divided along two axes: the first a commitment to objectivism or subjectivism, the second a \ncommitment to structure or agency. As shown in Figure 2, the blue boxes indicate some of the social \nscience epistemologies that the project encompassed. \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Map of social science (adapted from Hollis 1994) \n \n \nA few indicative names are shown to make the table easier to interpret. The left-hand column is \ngenerally associated with the rationalist, deterministic tradition. It is the older of the two, and grew out \nof naturalistic philosophy. The right-hand column is more recent, reflecting a greater emphasis on the \nsocial world in defining reality (ontology) and the construction of knowledge (epistemology). \nAlthough interpreting the two columns as an objective-subjective dichotomy risks gross \noversimplification, those in the left-hand column can be grouped loosely as sharing a belief in some \nform of \u2018objective\u2019 reality, whereas a more \u2018subjective\u2019 perspective permeates the ideas of those \nnamed in the right column. The column on the left is generally acknowledged to have a much greater \nconstituency (and to attract more funding) within social science than the traditions on the right that are \ninspired in part by a hermeneutic philosophy The table can also be understood in terms of different \naccounts of social systems and human action. The top row favours a view of society and the economy \nthat is biased toward the importance of structures and systems over individuals, whereas the bottom \nrow represents the opposite emphasis. This distinction is reflected in methodology in the sense that \ntheories in the top row tend to be deductive, deriving behaviour from general principles, whereas the \nbottom row is associated with the tradition of empiricism and positivism, where general principles are \nderived from experience through an inductive process. \n \nDuring the course of the OPAALS project this map helped researchers to see that the task of \ndeveloping a theoretical framework for DE research was necessarily rooted in the social sciences, as \nneither computer nor natural science embrace an epistemology that enables researchers to reflect \ncritically on their own ontology and epistemology, without recourse to some discipline within the \n 10 \nsocial sciences or humanities. A notable exception is the second-order cybernetics movement, and \nautopoiesis itself, which acknowledged the role of the observer as part of the system being observed \n(Brand 1976). However, the system perspective that predominates in these movements, as well as in \nthe more recent complexity science, makes them difficult to relate to associative and individualistic \nunderstandings of society. \n \nA drawback of this map is that it seems to conflate \u2018structuralism\u2019 and \u2018collectivism\u2019. Structuralism \nviews the relations of production as providing a structure within which individuals move and live their \nlives. When the relations of production take the form of capitalist institutions, the individual may \nappear to become a powerless pawn that can only move along corresponding predefined paths. The \nway to counter structural forces and constraints is for individuals to form larger groups that can \nbalance the weight of institutions: for example, labour unions. Collectivism can be understood as a \nhuman response to socio-economic structure. Therefore, although closely associated with \nstructuralism, collectivism is not synonymous with it. As discussed, for example, by Siedentop (2000) \nthe individualism\/collectivism dichotomy is also associated with the discourse of modernity, which \nadds another element of potential confusion. \n \nA central aspect of the modernity discourse is the issue of individual freedom vs. allegiance to the \ngroup (be it family, tribe, city, or nation. For example, countries like Italy can be seen to be in the \nmiddle of a transition from a \u2018pre-individualist society\u2019 (Siedentop 2000: 166-7), where the individual \nowes allegiance to his\/her family before him\/herself, to a society where the individual asserts his\/her \nright to individual freedom. Of course the Western discourse of modernity has been amply criticised \nby e.g. postmodernist philosophers (Lyotard 1979) as being deaf to other paths of cultural evolution \nand self-discovery. The point here is that both with respect to individualism and collectivism, the \nmodernity debate has been appropriated by political currents that are concerned mainly with questions \nof socio-economic action. This has contributed to further polarisation. For example, individual \nfreedom has been applied to economic action, becoming the cornerstone of neo-liberalism. By \ncontrast, collectivism can be taken as the starting point for new value systems based on social capital, \ncollaboration, and public goods theory, which underpin some of the DE propositions in the \nintroduction to this paper. For historical reasons that we cannot consider here, collectivism is also \nassociated with socialism, communism and fascism. These conflations caused a significant amount of \ninternal tension within the project as we strived for consistency with the OPAALS project\u2019s initial \nassumptions and for their validation.  \n \nIn addition to the challenge of defining a theoretical framework that could accommodate different \ndisciplinary viewpoints, we also faced another in that the European Commission had asked explicitly \nfor the project to develop a unified theory of digital ecosystems. A constructive way to respond was \nprovided ultimately be proposing a meta-theoretical framework (Dini et al. 2008b; Botto et al. 2008; \nDini et al. 2009). Although (predictably) falling short of the unification called for, this embraced all \nthe theoretical and disciplinary viewpoints encompassed by the project. The meta-theoretical \nframework addresses a wide range of themes, fields, and theoretical currents within and outside social \nscience which cannot be mapped easily onto the \u2018associative\u2019 and \u2018autopoietic\u2019 dichotomy in the title \nof the OPAALS project. This is not surprising since the work of the project transcended its initial \nconceptualisation. In the process of responding to these challenges, an appreciation of the implications \nof Foucault\u2019s analyses of power relations was fostered. In the next section we discuss the meta-\ntheoretical framework and, in the one following, we address aspects of the power relations that the \nreflexive element of our research helped to uncover. \n \n \nA binary meta-epistemological framework \n \nIt was necessary to develop a way of working with the variety of epistemological positions underlying \neach of the disciplinary research agendas described above. The solution devised was to identify the \nepistemological tensions within OPAALS\u2019s DE research and to acknowledge them rather than to gloss \nover them. Table 2 summarises four key axes of epistemological tension, the key \u2018big questions\u2019 in \n 11 \nrelation to DE research, and the theorists invoked in order to examine the complexities and \ncontradictions in depth.8 \n \n \nAxis of Debate \n \nKey problematic for DE Research Theorist \nEmpiricism vs. \nRationalism  \nShould (natural, computer, social) scientific research be \ndeductive or inductive? Are DE theories falsifiable?  \nPopper \nQuine \nObjectivism vs. \nSubjectivism \nHow do social and technological structures interact with \nindividual agency and interpretation? Can (should) structuralism \nand socio-constructivism be reconciled? \nPopper \nGadamer  \nGiddens \nIndividualism vs. \nStructuralism\/ \nCollectivism \nTo what extent can individualistic (market-driven) and \ncollectivist\/structuralist (open source, community-oriented, \nrelations of production-dependent) processes be reconciled in \nDEs? \nGiddens \nSymmetry vs. \nContext-dependence \nHow might the absolute values of the physical sciences translate \ninto situations demanding open-ended evolution? \nHolland \n \nTable 2: A summary of OPAALS\u2019s meta-epistemological binary framework \n \n \nWith respect to the tenets of objectivism and subjectivism, Karl Popper\u2019s (2002) insights on \u2018objective \nmethod\u2019 were taken as a reference for the former, and Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s (1975) philosophy of \nsubjective hermeneutic interpretation was taken as a reference point for the latter. Anthony Giddens\u2019s \n(1984, 1991) work was taken as a reference point in finding a constructive way to reconcile these \npositions. Next, because in DE research theoretical and metaphysical considerations are mixed with \nempirical observations and practical applications, it was necessary to acknowledge the presence of \nuseful roles for the tenets of both rationalism and empiricism. Popper\u2019s work offered a constructive \nbalance which is compatible with Giddens\u2019s work, while Giddens\u2019s insights also address, the \nindividualism vs. structuralism debate. For these reasons, Popper and Giddens were utilised to provide \na theoretical core around which theoretical constructions in DE research could be justified.9 We also \nproposed \u2018symmetry\u2019 and \u2018context-dependence\u2019 as discussed by Holland (1975) and Schreckling and \nDini (2009) as principles of order construction in biology, the former being associated with \nuniversalism and invariance of pattern and the latter with open-ended evolution and relativism. \nBecause we aimed to develop an evolutionary software environment that is at the same time reliable \nand able to create new functionality in response to user behaviour, this fourth epistemological \ndichotomy was considered appropriate to digital ecosystems (Dini et al. 2009: 25). \n \nPopper de-emphasises the importance of the tensions and complexities of subjectivism\/objectivism \n(hence being noted as an objectivist), and Giddens, in his work on structuration, tends to de-emphasise \nthe importance of individualism\/structuralism in favour of theorising and negotiating the relations of \nsubjectivism and objectivism. In his later works, Giddens (1991b) turns his attention to exploring the \nnotions of self-identity and life politics which take the individual as the focus of social action, and the \nimplications for social theory. His theory of structuration can be understood, however, as a collectivist \ntheory which aims at explaining how communities of social actors contribute to, and are affected by, \nsocial structure. Structuration as a concept can be employed to explain socio-economic action at both \nindividual and institutional levels and is helpful in understanding the balance between individualism \nand structuralism within DE research and within DEs themselves. Structuration is a theory or a \ndesignation of a process. \n \nThis epistemological framework offers:  \n \n\u2022  A rationalisation by which candidate theories or extensions to DE theory can be assessed through empirical \ntests and observation (Popper\u2019s falsifiability).  \n\u2022 A methodology rooted in empirical qualitative and quantitative data that, through integration with \nGiddens\u2019s structuration concept, can combine the empirical testing of theories with multi-stakeholder \n 12 \nprocesses for the phased introduction of digital ecosystems in different regional contexts understood in \nterms of social-constructivism theories.  \n\u2022 An epistemology based on structuration theory that puts processes of institutionalisation and of technology \ndevelopment on a similar footing, wherein structuralism is balanced by individual action and collective \nprocesses.  \n\u2022 A subjectivist and reflexive discourse that provides the foundation for the shared construction and equitable \nnegotiation of a governance framework for digital ecosystems communities.  \n\u2022 A compound epistemology of order construction in computer science that leverages nature\u2019s symmetries \nwhile remaining open to new forms and, hence, is able to interface to human expression and behaviour.  \n \nThis framework brings together a variety of orthogonal theoretical viewpoints. The intention of \nsuggesting these juxtapositions was not to force these points of view together in order to suggest a new \nsynthesis, but instead to show the necessity of working with and exploring a variety of theoretical \nviewpoints in order to find creative ways to locate, ontologically and epistemologically, and construct, \nthrough the process of reflexive research, a theoretical framework for DEs. The framework is best \nunderstood as being indicative of four dimensions of epistemological activity in constant dialogue \nwith each other and facilitated through a network of multi-disciplinary research. To provide an \nenvironment for scientific enquiry that would be sufficiently safe for the participants to engage in the \npursuit of difficult dialogues, it was also necessary to acknowledge the importance of an additional \nunderlying discussion concerning the emergence of different epistemes and their respective power \nrelationships. \n \n \nTotalitarian theories and meta-theoretical apparatuses \n \nIt is not possible for power to be exercised without knowledge, it is impossible for knowledge not to \nengender power. \u2018Liberate scientific research from the demands of monopoly capitalism\u2019: maybe it\u2019s a \ngood slogan, but it will never be more than a slogan. (Foucault 1980: 52)10 \n \nThe research conducted in OPAALS was intended to be responsive to the European Commission\u2019s \nrequest for a \u2018Science of Digital Ecosystems\u2019. Our response was to highlight an inconsistency between \na normative request to distribute every aspect of the architecture (see above discussion) and a demand \nfor the development of an \u2018exclusive\u2019 science. Foucault\u2019s characterisation of a larger problematic fits \nwell with the dilemma encountered by the project: \n \nWhat types of knowledge do you want to disqualify in the very instant of your demand: \u2018It is a science\u2019? \n\u2026 Which theoretical-political avant garde do you want to enthrone in order to isolate it from all the \ndiscontinuous forms of knowledge that circulate about it? \u2026 in contrast to the various projects which aim \nto inscribe knowledges in the hierarchical order of power associated with science, a genealogy should be \nseen as a kind of attempt to emancipate historical knowledges from that subjection, to render them, that \nis, capable of opposition and of struggle against the coercion of a theoretical, unitary, formal and \nscientific discourse. (Ibid.: 85) \n \nFollowing Foucault\u2019s insistence on a genealogy of knowledge which emancipates disciplines to \ndevelop and to struggle against the \u2018the tyranny of globalising discourses\u2019 (Ibid.: 83) exemplified by \nthe enthroning of a single avant garde theory such as the notion of a unified \u2018Science of Digital \nEcosystems\u2019, the OPAALS researchers sought to ensure that the insights drawn from different \ndisciplines were drawn upon in a way that valued their respective contributions. \n \nIn contrast to the top-down directive emanating from the hierarchy of the Commission, the \nresearchers\u2019 experience of the project hinted at the possibility of a system of ideas which can be related \nto Luhmann\u2019s autopoietic system of communications (Dini et al. 2009: 68) in the sense that he argues \nthat social systems are built from recursive communications. This experience was also resonant with \nFoucault\u2019s understanding of the \u2018apparatus\u2019 of a given system of relations of power: \n \n\u2026 a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, \nregulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and \n 13 \nphilanthropic propositions \u2013 in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the \napparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements. \n\u2026 The apparatus is thus always inscribed in a play of power, but it is also always linked to certain \ncoordinates of knowledge which issue from it but, to an equal degree, condition it. This is what the \napparatus consists in: strategies of relations of forces supporting, and supported by, types of knowledge. \n(Ibid.: 195, 196) \n \nIn his discussion of the \u2018apparatus\u2019 of knowledge, Foucault distinguishes between the strategies of \nrelations of the forces of knowledge creation and the episteme or types of knowledge.  This is relevant \nto our discussion of the search for an interdisciplinary epistemology because these distinctions help to \nreveal what procedures and ideas come to be accorded scientific status and which do not.  \n \nThe episteme is the \u2018apparatus\u2019 which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of \nwhat may from what may not be characterised as scientific. (Ibid.: 197) \n \nIn his discussion, Foucault is referring to the status of knowledge in the context of a particular \ndiscipline or epistemology.11 In the OPAALS project, we encountered the need for a \u2018society of \ndisciplines\u2019 or a \u2018society of epistemologies\u2019 and, hence, the idea of the \u2018apparatus\u2019 of knowledge \noffered a helpful starting point. The further development of these ideas could not be pursued within \nthe project itself. Nevertheless, with these observations, we have the conceptual references to offer a \nmore detailed discussion of what emerged as possible and impossible with respect to the \ninterdisciplinarity inquiry into and understanding of DEs. \n \n  \nTHE (IM)POSSIBILITY OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY \n \nIn a research area such as DEs, which is defined by its interdisciplinary collaboration and a wide array \nof theoretical and applied expertise, the theoretical framework itself needs to be complex and open to \nadaptation and evolution as the research progresses and its boundaries shift. It needs to be both \u2018inter-\ndisciplinary\u2019 and \u2018inter-epistemological\u2019. The experiences of approaching the DE challenges from a \nvariety of disciplinary perspectives allowed some valuable lessons to be learned.  \n \nWorking with apparently irreconcilable epistemologies at times simply involved acknowledging \ncontradiction. For example, in relation to the divide between socio-constructivism and objectivist \nperspectives on DE technology, it was clear that both perspectives have relevance and importance. It \nwas important to acknowledge that socio-constructivism is not necessarily anti-objectivist and that it \ncannot be extended to discuss \u2018absolutely everything\u2019 (Boghossian 2001). In DE research, social \nconstructivism can be very useful in illuminating some aspects of socio-economic action particularly \nwith respect to socio-economic development processes, but this does not mean that objectivist \nperspectives must be abandoned since these are easier to relate to quantitative indicators, empirical \ndata, and pragmatic policy discussions. \n \nUltimately, OPAALS research highlighted a key point about interdisciplinary collaboration, alluded to \nin Figure 1: namely, that social science perspectives are best suited for understanding the values \nembedded through technology (software) use, whereas the bio-computing perspective may, if \neventually successful, make it possible to synthesise software automatically. Between these two modes \nof relating to software technology sits a third, i.e. software design\/creation. Since software design \nand\/or creation is the human expression of a technical artefact represented as a formal language that is \nsubject to mathematical laws or constraints, it appears to serve as the nexus of different \n\u2018epistemological currents\u2019.12 This interplay between objectivist (integrated natural and computer \nscience) perspectives and subjectivist (hermeneutic and socio-constructivist) perspectives is \ngraphically represented in Figure 3. This figure can also be seen as a first attempt at conceptualising \nan \u2018apparatus\u2019 for the knowledge society. \n \nThis figure is rooted in the engineering practice of using schemata to formalise and communicate the \nstructural and functional architecture of systems. When the systems in question involve social actors \n 14 \nsuch schemata cannot help but appear to be reductionist, requiring complementary argumentation and \nexplanation. The figure schematically depicts important sociological arguments about the ways in \nwhich ICTs are integrated in the social life of their users (see e.g. Bell 1979; Castells 1996, 2003; \nWebster 2006; Mansell 2010). Figure 3 proposes that this can be explained through a virtual circle or a \nclosed and self-reinforcing cycle that links ICT production to ICT consumption through feedbacks that \nare tighter than is observed for older, physical technologies. Starting with the development of \nsoftware, i.e. of the medium, a case can be made for a \u2018reverse compilation\u2019 process that can in \nprinciple transform electronic circuits into corresponding software programs, then into formal \nlanguages, and ultimately into natural language grammars, i.e. \u2018syntax as machine\u2019. \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Media as the nexus of different epistemological currents: \nthe kernel of a Foucauldian \u2018knowledge society apparatus\u2019 \n \n \nBy progressive abstraction, we encounter the still-open debate about the signifying capacity of syntax \nvs. semantics. At this preliminary stage of (meta-)theory construction we gloss over the finer points of \nthis debate, claiming that we have a \u2018language\u2019 \u2013 which can usefully underpin social constructivist \nprocesses involving human beings. Such processes, in turn, mediate the formation of social groups, \ninstitutions, and economic and cultural production. Such intangible artefacts of the knowledge \neconomy are then channelled through ICTs for wider distribution and consumption. The life of a \nsociety or an economy is studied by social science. If we start from social science and humanities \nconcerns with cultural expression and production, i.e. with the message, we can draw upon critical \ntheories of technology (Feenberg 1991, 2002) which indicate that our technologies embody cultural \nvalues and, reciprocally, that our cultures influence the technologies that are produced, thereby closing \nthe cycle. It was through interdisciplinary dialogue and exchange that this understanding of DEs as a \nsystem was achieved by the collaborating researchers from different disciplines who were engaged in \nthe OPAALS project. \n \nAnother outcome of OPAALS\u2019s interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange was the emergence of \nnew ways of thinking about problems usually firmly rooted in discipline-specific ways of working. As \nthe work of the project progressed, many of the natural, physical, and computer scientists working in \nthe project came to appreciate the concept of reflexivity and developed a greater awareness of the \nimplications of \u2018paradigms\u2019 (Kuhn 1996). The task of writing a report together with social scientists \nand critiquing the software architecture (Moschoyiannis et al. 2008) provided computer scientists with \nthe opportunity to discuss the aspects, from a social science perspective, of the requirement that the \n 15 \narchitecture of a DE be fully distributed. However, the discussion did not go as far as to question the \nnormative character of this requirement. In other words, the science and the engineering parts of the \nproject were \u2018colonised\u2019 by social science perspectives and sensibilities only to an extent that was \nconsidered \u2018safe\u2019. \n \nThe OPAALS project also embraced research on DEs drawing on possible interpretations and \napplications of social network analysis (Colugnati et al. 2008). This ranged from the concept of a \nscale-free network to the implementation of an agent-based simulation environment specifically \ndesigned to visualise social networks of partners, SMEs, and user communities in Brazil and India.13 \nThis development can be seen as a reciprocal colonisation of the social sciences by the sciences. \n \nThese developments offer lessons in the possibilities of radically interdisciplinary research that aims to \ninclude perspectives from disciplines as divergent as the natural, computer and social sciences. These \npossibilities are centred on the notion of collaboration between researchers and their domains of \nexpertise that retain a strong disciplinary identity, yet are willing to stretch outside their comfort zones \nto engage with, and attempt to understand, alternative perspectives. These possibilities of \ninterdisciplinary collaboration require a willingness to experiment with alternative ways of \nrepresenting knowledge and ideas. \n \nThe diagrams included in this paper are illustrative of this point. They originate in the language of \nengineering and are appropriate for expressing systemic ideas. However, they can also be used to \n\u2018interpret\u2019 and \u2018fix\u2019 social sciences ideas in a way that is helpful for those with backgrounds outside \nthe social sciences. Interdisciplinary collaboration requires \u2018trying out\u2019 thinking patterns that emerge \nfrom the epistemological perspectives of other disciplines: in our case this resulted in a constant \noscillation between objectivity and subjectivity. This oscillation needs to start and end somewhere \u2013 \nmore often than not the researcher\u2019s \u2018home\u2019 discipline \u2013 but the process itself is valuable and allows \nfor shared, applied goals to be achieved and new insights to be developed. The perspective on \ninterdisciplinarity that emerged from OPAALS suggests that valuable outcomes can be achieved at the \napplied level and valuable social or cognitive dynamics can be achieved at the theoretical level.  \nHowever, a key insight pertains to the impossibility of interdisciplinarity and the search for unification \n(that is, merging two unrelated phenomena under the same theoretical model). The fact that OPAALS \nincluded mathematical physics, cell biology, abstract algebra, and theoretical computer science led to \na common perception that the theory of DEs OPAALS was working towards would be rooted in the \nfield of Complexity Science, that is, that we would aim for theoretical and applied unification, rather \nthan integration, between these domains.14  \n \n\u2018Complexity\u2019 is a theoretical term that has been borrowed from natural science by social science with \nfruitful and \u2013 perhaps predictably \u2013 complex results. Theories of complexity originated in the natural \nsciences as tools for understanding non-linear dynamics, that is \u2018disorder \u2013 or apparent disorder \u2013 in \nnature, including turbulence in fluids, the erratic flows of epidemics, the arrhythmic writhing of a \nheart in the moments before death\u2019 (Bryant 2007: 131). This shift from a Newtonian to a non-linear \nscientific paradigm has influenced social philosophy (Fuchs 2003: 387). Non-linear theories, as well \naiming to explicitly recognise and map observed disorder, also aim to calculate and\/or reveal the \npatterns and structures underlying that \u2018chaos\u2019 so as to better harness and predict it (Bryant 2007: \n133). In the social sciences, certain elements of this tradition have been appropriated and adapted as a \nframework to understand the complexities of the social world. Integral to the complexity approach, \narguably, are two central issues:  \n \nFirst, the extent to which complexity theory\u2019s concepts can be used metaphorically and second the ability \nof theories of complexity to model social processes. These issues are connected with two more \nfundamental problems. The first one concerns the way that researchers from the two different \ncommunities communicate across disciplinary boundaries. The second one relates to the underlining \ncommensurability of notions across the two fields and questions the suitability of complexity-related \nideas to model social processes (Dini and Berdou 2004: 25).  \n \n 16 \nOther scholars note that \u2018complexity research stands only at the threshold of acceptance in the social \nsciences\u2019 and that it \u2018does not offer a well-articulated body of theory, but rather a number of more-or-\nless related phenomena: dissipative structures; catastrophe; chaos; self-organized criticality; and self-\norganization\u2019 (Campbell-Hunt 2007: 796). We suggest that complexity science cannot offer a well-\narticulated body of theory precisely due to the presence of conceptual plurality and incommensurable \nepistemological difference in the many \u2018more or less related phenomena\u2019 brought under the \ncomplexity umbrella. The second key lesson drawn from the OPAALS interdisciplinary research thus \nrelates to the impossibility of interdisciplinary unification. Instead, we argue for the possibility of \nintegration, where this is understood as efforts to enable different theories to coexist with a degree of \ncompatibility that does not need to imply that the same epistemological foundation underpins them. \nThis approach worked well for the project. \n \nAs a final example of the importance of our perspective on interdisciplinarity, computer science DE \nresearch fell prey to a trap in European Commission-funded research that is becoming increasingly \nvisible with each R&D Framework Programme. Most EU projects in the ICT area try to respond to \ntwo sets of expectations: on the one hand, traditions of scientific research from the physical and \nnatural sciences motivate the Commission officials to expect innovative \u2018advanced research\u2019 results in \nthe form of new architectures and algorithms; on the other hand, the results of the research and of the \ninnovations are expected to achieve the potential for market adoption and socio-economic impact. \nWhereas these two sets of expectations may be reasonably aligned in disciplines such as applied \nphysics, electronic engineering, nanotechnology, or biotechnology, in ICT-related enquiries these two \nsets of expectations are more difficult to align. The reason is that the greater the level of innovation the \nless likely it is that there will be a clear pathway to its adoption. Market adoption in the software area \nis strongly dependent on legacy software and prior use, existing skill-sets, standards, and languages. \nThus, developing an ingenious new software artefact, architecture, implementation, interaction \nprotocol, etc., is more likely to impede early market adoption than to facilitate it. The research and \ninnovation policy research objectives fostered by the European Commission would be enhanced if \nthey were informed by these observations about the interdisciplinary challenges involved in ICT-\nrelated research. \n \nTheoretical interdisciplinarity and applied research, as we discovered through the process of building a \nDE framework that could hold a variety of often conflicting epistemological positions, arguably \nbenefits not from unification but from difference, creatively integrated, which drives innovation, \ncommunication, and social dynamics. \n \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \nThis paper has discussed the process of interdisciplinary collaboration and research that defined the \nOPAALS research project. It has provided a description of the different, yet complementary, research \nagendas of each disciplinary domain of the research project and given an account of the challenging \nquestions of epistemology that arose in developing a theoretical framework for DEs. This framework \nwas summarised in the form of a meta-theoretical framework that was specifically developed in the \nproject to highlight and leverage epistemological contradiction and theoretical difference. \n \nThe lessons that can be extrapolated from the theoretical and applied experience of OPAALS research \ncan be summarised in the phrase: the (im)possibility of interdisciplinarity. The core possibility of \ninterdisciplinary research is the fact that those adhering to radically diverse disciplines can collaborate \nto achieve a shared, applied goal \u2013 such as the definition of an architecture for DEs in tandem with the \ndevelopment of an understanding of their socio-economic potential. The impossibility of \ninterdisciplinary research is associated with the impossibility of ultimate theoretical unification among \ndisciplines based on contradictory epistemological foundations. It is not fruitful to attempt to make \nthem fit within the same theory. We argue that the contradictions and complexity of various \ndisciplinary perspectives should not be approached with the expectation that they will unite into a new \nparadigm that transcends or eliminates received knowledge.

Thus, \u2018evolutionary architecture\u2019 sounds rather impressive to anyone who has not attempted to \nbuild one, and \u2018sustainable socio-economic development based on democratic principles, trust, transparency, and \naccountability\u2019 sounds very feasible to non-social scientists, but is very difficult to achieve.  \n2 As the first author is the OPAALS project coordinator, the second one of its researchers, and the third a professor who co-\nled the project, this paper is inescapably a somewhat subjective account of the inner workings of a research project. All three \nauthors were involved in writing project reports aiming to develop a theoretical framework for digital ecosystems; all three \nconsider themselves interdisciplinary researchers. Paolo Dini comes from an engineering, applied mathematics, and physics \nbackground, and works at the interface between theoretical computer science and cell biology; and, separately, on social \ntheory in relation to new media. Mehita Iqani works at the interface of the humanities and social sciences in the field of \nmedia and communications. Robin Mansell is a social scientist with training in social psychology, politics and economics as \nwell as in telecommunications engineering who focuses on media and communication. This paper is itself, therefore, the \noutcome of an interdisciplinary encounter and many challenging discussions about the very different epistemologies that \nunderlie each disciplinary tradition. \n3 The centralisation of computer science in this diagram is partly due to the fact that Directorate General (DG) ICT, which \nhas a strong focus on digital technologies, funded OPAALS. The DG (ICT) was also known, during different framework \nprogrammes, as DG Information Society (DG INFSO), DG Information Society Technologies (DG IST), or DG Information \nSociety and Media. \n4 Interestingly, according to Floridi \u2018in the genetic code, the medium (the genes) is the message\u2019 (Floridi, 2010: 80), thereby \nsuggesting that biology has been able to achieve an even tighter feedback loop than is shown in Figure 2. \n5 These include questions of distributed identity, accountability, and trust; the architecture of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks; \nthe distributed coordination of transactions for complex long-running services; and distributed storage solutions. \n6 This area of research has focussed mainly on modelling a language called SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabularies and \nBusiness Rules). \n7 For example, although concepts like phase transitions and percolation (Silverberg and Verspagen 2005) have been used to \ndescribe and even model the interactions between companies in the context of innovation economics, a fundamental \nontological and epistemological incompatibility remains between the concept of socio-economic relations between firms in \nthe latter and the concept of interaction potential between molecules in the former. \n 20 \n                                                                                                                                                   \n8 For a more detailed discussion, see Chapter 3 of Dini et al. (2009). \n9 Although, as shown above and discussed by Hollis (1994), Quine (1951) usefully extends Popper\u2019s theory, we take the \nconcept of falsifiability as the main point of reference, which Quine\u2019s ideas also support, albeit at a more abstract level. \n10 It is tempting and it would be quite interesting to paraphrase this slogan into \u2018Liberate European research from the \ndemands of European Commission politics\u2019, and then to proceed with an analysis of what might motivate such a slogan. But \nthis would take us too far from the focus of this paper which is on interdisciplinarity. \n11 We are not conflating the two concepts here, but depending on the discipline, they can have reciprocal roles. For example, \nwithin the objectivist epistemology of physics we can accommodate different disciplines such as chemistry and various \nbranches of engineering. By contrast, within social science as a disciplinary domain we can accommodate different \nepistemologies (objectivism of mainstream economics, phenomenology, social constructivism, etc). \n12 The shifting nature or perception of software between \u2018linguistic artefact\u2019 and \u2018machine\u2019 is well reflected in the differences \nbetween how software as intellectual property is addressed in Europe where it is mainly protected by copyright vs. the US, \nwhere it is protected by patents. \n13 See http:\/\/evesim.org\/  \n14 Using the definition of these terms we have proposed, it is interesting to note that people from the sciences tend \nautomatically to aim for unification, whereas people from the social sciences as a rule have more modest aims towards \nintegration. We think this is a consequence of the different levels of awareness in these two disciplinary domains of questions \nof epistemology. In the sciences and engineering \u2018life is easy\u2019 since physics provides good answers for most \u2018fundamental\u2019 \nquestions. In the social sciences, researchers have become used to proceeding with caution. \n"}
