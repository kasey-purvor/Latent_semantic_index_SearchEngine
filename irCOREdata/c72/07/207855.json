It argues that certain problems arise in \nreconciling this work\u2019s detailed explanations of the media field\u2019s internal workings (and \nthe interrelations of that field\u2019s workings to the workings of other fields) and general \nclaims made about the \u2018symbolic power\u2019 of media in a broader sense. These problems \ncan be solved, the author argues, by adopting the concept of metacapital developed by \nBourdieu himself in his late work on the state, and returning to the wider framework of \nsymbolic system and symbolic power that was important in Bourdieu\u2019s social theory \nbefore it became dominated by field-theory. Media, it is proposed, have meta-capital over \nthe rules of play, and the definition of capital (especially symbolic capital), that operate \nwithin a wide range of contemporary fields of production, and this level of explanation \nneeds to be added to specific accounts of the detailed workings of the media field. The \nconclusion points to questions for further work, including on the relative strength of the \nstate\u2019s and the media\u2019s metacapital which must be carried out through detailed empirical \nwork on a global comparative basis.\n 3\nMEDIA META-CAPITAL: EXTENDING THE RANGE OF BOURDIEU\u2019S FIELD \nTHEORY \n     \n \nThe question of media power in a broad sense \u2013 how are we to theorise the long-term \nimpacts of the existence and actions of media institutions on social space?1 \u2013 remains one \nof great difficulty. The media are both a production process with specific internal \ncharacteristics (possibly a field of such processes) and a source of taken-for-granted \nframeworks for understanding the reality they represent (an influence, potentially, on \naction in all fields). Accounts of media and media power which concentrate exclusively \non either questions of \u2018production\u2019 or on questions of ideological \u2018effects\u2019 are likely, \ntherefore, to be unsatisfactory. A version of the former problem faces recent work on \nmedia within Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s tradition of field-based research, in spite of that work\u2019s \nother virtues. The solution lies in drawing more extensively than such research has done \nto date on Bourdieu\u2019s own theory of the state, particularly the concept of the state\u2019s \n\u2018metacapital\u2019 over all fields, which offers, as we shall see, a useful analogy to, although \nnot a direct explanation for, the way media institutions impact on an increasingly large \nrange of other fields. This, however, represents a significant extension of the parameters \nof field-theory, as usually understood. \n \nThis argument  requires some historical context. Media are one area where the dialogue \nbetween Anglo-American sociology and what can justifiably be called Bourdieu\u2019s \n\u2018school of sociology\u20192 has been limited, although, as Rodney Benson3 showed recently in \n 4\nthis journal, media attracted considerable attention in the 1990s not so much from \nBourdieu himself as from his research associates, particularly Patrick Champagne.4 One \nreason, perhaps, for this limited dialogue is an underlying historical and theoretical \ntension between Marxist-influenced Anglo-American accounts of media power directed \nat the media\u2019s ideological impacts on the whole of society and Bourdieu\u2019s tradition of \nfield-based research that is hostile precisely to general theorising about social space.5 For \nthat reason, there is no simple basis of exchange  between recent Bourdieu-inspired work \non media and other better-known theorisations of media and media power.  \n \nThis is worth explaining in a little more detail, in order to contextualise the extended \nversion of Bourdieu\u2019s field theory proposed in this article. If the influential 1970s and \n1980s British and American tradition of critical media sociology approached the media\u2019s \ncontribution to social reality through ideology6, arguing that the media reproduce and \ndisseminate ideological contents originally generated elsewhere (above all, the state), the \ncausal relationship between media-channeled ideology and people\u2019s beliefs proved \nelusive;7 in any case, this work told us little about the status of media institutions \nthemselves in society generally or in specific sectors of social life.8 By contrast, \npostmodern social theory9 did address the impacts of media institutions on social \nstructure, but only through suggestive pronouncements, rather than empirically grounded \ndetail, so there is no basis of reconnection with Bourdieu\u2019s work here. Within a third \nperspective, Luhmann\u2019s systems model of \u2018the reality of the mass media\u201910 offers (in its \nown terms at least) a rigorous account of how media work within social reality, but one \nwhich excludes ideological effects. The truth or falsity of specific media representations \n 5\nis irrelevant according to Luhmann,11 who concentrates on the broad functional \ninterrelations between media \u2018system\u2019 and social \u2018system\u2019, thereby obscuring precisely \nthe contingencies underlying the media process that are most ideological: the tendency \nfor this person or thing, rather than that, to be heard or seen. So while in its respect for the \ninternal workings of media as a productive system Luhmann\u2019s work has something in \ncommon with Bourdieu, the former\u2019s neglect of issues of conflict and power moves as far \nas possible from the political commitment of the latter, who in this respect is much closer \nto Anglo-US ideology critiques. \n \nBourdieu\u2019s own work on media and that of researchers close to him could not insist more \nstrongly on the wider social and political consequences of the media process. The result \nhas been some of the boldest criticisms of \u2018media culture\u2019 in any tradition, a further \nreason for the recent unpopularity of such of its work (mainly Bourdieu\u2019s On Television \nand Journalism) as has reached audiences in Britain and the US, where sweeping \ncriticisms of contemporary media have in some quarters become unfashionable. Take this \nremark from that book: \u2018one thing leads to another, and, ultimately television, which \nclaims to record reality, creates it instead. We are getting closer and closer to the point \nwhere the social world is primarily described \u2013 and in a sense prescribed \u2013 by \ntelevision\u2019.12 The French version is more vivid: \u2018on va de plus en plus vers des univers ou \nle monde social est d\u00e9crit-prescrit par la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision. La t\u00e9l\u00e9vision devient l\u2019arbitre de \nl\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019existence sociale et politique\u2019 .13 The hybrid word \u2018d\u00e9crit-prescrit\u2019 captures, if \npolemically, the naturalising effect of an institutional sector which generates the very \ncategories through which the social world14 is perceived: a classic Durkheimian point. \n 6\nSimilarly bold comments on the \u2018symbolic power\u2019 of the media, particularly television, \nare found in the work of Champagne, as we shall see (section 1b below). The question, \nhowever, on which this article focuses is whether these bold statements are theoretically \ncompatible with the field-theory of media, the latter being the only developed theory of \nmedia that Bourdieu and linked researchers have offered. As that theory stands, they are \nnot.  \n \nWhile we come later to the virtues of field-based media research (section 1(a)), there is \nalso something paradoxical about it, at least viewed from other media research traditions, \nin that it avoids both a general account of the impacts of media representations on social \nspace and a detailed account of media audiences. Its explanatory dynamics are located \nentirely in the internal workings of the journalistic field or in the specific connections \nbetween those internal workings and the operations of other fields which come into \ncontact with it. The result is often to extend in interesting ways Anglo-US work on the \nsociology of media production.15 The cost, however, is a tension (section 1(b) below) \nbetween the avoidance of theoretical issues that arise outside the field model and the \nbolder judgements about media that its proponents, probably justifiably, want to make.   \n \nThis tension is linked to a wider division in Bourdieu\u2019s work between his early, less field-\nfocussed, work on symbolic systems and symbolic power (see section 1(c)) and his later \nwork on fields. This is not so much a problem, as a genuine theoretical crux, since we are \nback here to the original difficulty for all theorisations of media with which this article \nbegan. Hence resolving the tensions of field-based accounts of media, as this article tries \n 7\nto do, by drawing on Bourdieu\u2019s theorisation elsewhere of the state\u2019s social power (see \nsection 2), has dividends, not only for our appreciation of the continuity of Bourdieu\u2019s \nwork, but also for rethinking some of the aporias of 1970s and 1980s Marxist work on \nmedia ideology. It is ironic, no doubt, to be arguing - a quarter of a century since the \nheyday of Althusserian theories of the media\u2019s role among the \u2018ideological state \napparatuses\u2019 - that the way forward for contemporary media analyses is via a linkage \nbetween Bourdieu\u2019s divergent theories of the media field and the state (Bourdieu himself \nhaving clearly turned his back on Althusserian models).16 The difference, however, \nbetween the argument developed here and earlier Anglo-US approaches to media\/ state is \nthat, first, we will build on the achievements of Bourdieu\u2019s own sociology with its \nrejection of crude totalising accounts of power from \u2018the centre\u2019 and, second, we will \nseek in doing so to draw on the Durkheim-inspired insights into symbolic power \nelsewhere in Bourdieu\u2019s work. As to the latter Durkheimian tradition, including \nBourdieu\u2019s own attempt to fuse Marx and Durkheim, it has been ignored in Anglo-US \nmedia sociology, with only a few exceptions.17   \n \nIt is necessary to clarify, first, how the term \u2018media\u2019 will be used. By \u2018media\u2019 here is \nmeant the media which, until recently, have been assumed to be society\u2019s \u2018central\u2019 media \n- television, radio and the general press. True, this cuts across a valid distinction between \n\u2018central\u2019 media and media more specialised in their audience, but this is necessary if we \nare to begin to address the dimension of media most challenging for field theory: \nprecisely the broader social impact of \u2018les m\u00e9dias de grande diffusion\u201918, both within and \nbeyond specific fields.19 True, this leaves to one side arguments about whether new \n 8\nmedia (particularly the Internet and media digitalization) will undermine or simply \nrefashion the social centrality currently attributed to television, radio and the press.20 But \nthis simplification is justified tactically for two reasons. First, it reflects the focus of \nmedia research in the Bourdieu tradition which has not to date analysed new media. \nSecond, there are good reasons to be sceptical about how fundamentally new media, \nespecially the Internet, are changing patterns of media consumption, let alone people\u2019s \norientation to media as sources of social legitimacy.21 The conclusion, however, returns \nto this and other broader issues raised by the analysis.   \n \n1. The Incompleteness of the Media Field \n \nThere is little doubt that, as a sphere of cultural production, the media can prima facie be \nanalysed as a single field, or a collection of fields, (each) with a distinctive pattern of \nprestige and status, its own values.  Indeed, according to Bourdieu, the media\u2019s \nintermediate position between the cultural and economic poles of the wider cultural field \ngives it a particular interest as a field. This section notes the positive contribution of field \ntheory to media analysis, before identifying a key tension in its treatment of media power.  \n \n(a) The Media as Field(s)? \n \nIn the course of the 1990s, Bourdieu\u2019s research associates produced a number of \nilluminating studies of the workings of the \u2018journalistic field\u2019 (champ journalistique) or \n\u2018media field\u2019 (champ m\u00e9diatique), both terms being used, although the former is more \n 9\ncommon. The main argument running through this research was summarised by Bourdieu \nhimself in his contrvoversial lectures published in English under the title On Television \nand Journalism. The argument which is framed in relation to French media culture is \nessentially as follows:  \n \n1. the journalistic field has always occupied a pivotal role in the field of cultural \nproduction, because of its specific role in circulating to a wider audience the \nknowledges of other, more specialised fields. As such, the journalistic field faces \ncontradictory pressures from economic (heteronomous) and cultural (autonomous) \nforces.  \n2. In the 1980s and 1990s a combination of factors (including challenges to Le Monde\u2019s \nlegitimacy as the main representative of \u2018serious\u2019 journalism and the increasing \nlegitimacy of television, as a mode of popular journalism) led to an increasing \ninfluence of television over press journalism and the increasing predominance of \neconomic influences in the media field as a whole. \n3. The increasing heteronomy of the media field has had profound effects on other fields \nof cultural production through the specific form which their relations to the media \nfield have come to take: an increased influence of television news criteria within \njournalism has increased the susceptibility of those other fields to external (economic) \npressures, reducing their autonomy as fields and increasing their reliance, \nspecifically, on the media field. \n \n 10 \nNo doubt we have learnt much from field-based treatments of the media. First, there have \nbeen detailed accounts of the changing workings of the journalistic field (2. above) \nshowing specific ways in which journalistic autonomy, not just in France but also in the \nUS, has been reduced.22. There remain, of course, numerous issues of detail, such as \nwhether there is one such field or many, and, if many, how are they interrelated,23 but \nthey are of secondary importance, since for Bourdieu the exact boundaries of fields and \nsub-fields always remains a contingent question for detailed empirical enquiry, rather \nthan a theoretical issue.  Much more important are the advances that field research has \nbrought to our understanding of journalistic sources and story-telling practices, \naugmenting previous Anglo-US work on the sociology of journalism carried out under \nvery different economic and cultural conditions in the 1970s and early 1980s (see above). \n \nThe other way in which field research has contributed to our understanding of media is \naccounts of the changing interrelations between the media field and other fields of \ncultural production (3. above). These have been discussed in detail by Rodney Benson,24, \nso will not be repeated here; they include studies of media\u2019s influences on the intellectual \nfield, the judiciary and the medical field. Together they build a rich, historically nuanced, \npicture of the increasing influence in many fields of a generalist, economically driven \njournalism. These accounts rely not on any general notion of ideology, but on specific \nanalyses of how the changing internal dynamics of the journalistic field (for example, \nstruggles for dominance between specialist medical press and general news journalists) \nmesh with the dynamics of those other fields (for example, the emergence of new \nspokespersons and interest groups in and around the medical field): see for the medical \n 11 \ncase Champagne and Marchetti\u2019s work discussed further below. It is clear that much is \ngained by breaking down otherwise highly general claims about \u2018media power\u2019 into \nspecific, historically researchable questions about how external factors (the increasing \neconomic pressures on media production) \u2018are \u201ctranslated\u201d by the internal logic of the \nnews media field (and then, how this translated logic is translated into other related \nfields)\u2019.25  \n \nThere are, however, limitations to the field theory model developed in this work. As \nBenson argues, there is an ambiguity about what exactly is the source of the \u2018external \nfactors\u2019 influencing the media field and the balance within those external factors of \neconomic (market) and political (state) forces; this ambiguity relates to an ambivalence \nabout how to analyse the state itself.26 This affects how one can read the direction of \ninfluence between the media field and other fields (such as the medical field), given that \neconomic and political forces affect each in quite specific ways.  \n \nThis article, however, will be concerned with a different issue, namely the implications of \nthe type of influence which field research posits from the media field to other fields. How \nfields interrelate has always been a difficult question for a research programme whose \nfirst concern is always with the internal workings of particular fields.27 To understand \nfield interrelations field theory has relied on the notion that sets of fields change in \ntandem through \u2018homologies\u2019 between their internal operations, but as Swartz points out \n\u2018homology\u2019 just defers explanation to the question of what forces drive the actors in those \nfields. In Bourdieu\u2019s earlier work, this was above all \u2018habitus\u2019,28 but, given the bias of \n 12 \nhabitus towards influences from long-standing dispositions, it is much less clear what \nunderlying mechanism field theory has at its disposal to explain the convergences of sets \nof fields in a fast-changing economic and cultural environment. 29  \n \nSo far this problem is a general one. The two next sections specify more clearly what is at \nstake here, linking to broader questions of symbolic power which cannot be contained \nwithin the framework of field theory.  \n \n(b) Specific Problem Cases for a Field Theory of Media  \n \nI want first to show, more directly, that using field theory as an exclusive framework of \nexplanation creates difficulties, or gaps, in Bourdieu\u2019s and his research associates\u2019 \naccount of the media.  \n \nLet\u2019s turn to Bourdieu\u2019s main explicit treatment of the media, the two television talks \ncollected under the title On Television and Journalism.30 This book has been criticised for \nsome of its more sweeping generalisations about the way media represent the social \nworld (their \u2018trivialisation\u2019 of it). I am not convinced by these criticisms, particularly \ngiven the background of empirical work on media fields on which Bourdieu implicitly \nrelied. My interest instead is with the gap between Bourdieu\u2019s detailed discussion of how \nthe media field(s) operate as fields of production and his reference to the overwhelming \n\u2018symbolic power\u2019 of television. Implicitly the gap is filled by the convergences assumed \nbetween changes within the journalistic field (television\u2019s increasing dominance, with its \n 13 \ngreater susceptibility to economic influences translated through appeals to audience \nratings) and changes in other fields (their increased openness to relations within the \njournalistic field). But how exactly does this convergence work?   \n \nThere must be some causal mechanism that explains how what actors in particular non-\nmedia fields do is changing. There is more than one type of explanation that could fill \nthis gap in relation to any one non-media field: (1) specific factors (for example, an \nincreasing dependence on markets or audiences reachable only through media) that make \nmedia coverage of increased importance to actors in that particular non-media field; (2) \nspecific factors making media coverage more important to actors in a range of related \nnon-media fields (for example, the pressures from the state to make various types of \nservice politically \u2018accountable\u2019, as currently in the educational or health fields); or (3) \ngeneral factors that have increased the perceived importance of media coverage across all \nfields. Only the first type of explanation remains within the framework of field theory. \nThe second involves acknowledging changing pressures from other sources on a range of \nfields, so moving beyond what the intensified economic forces which Bourdieu sees as \noperating through the proxy of the media field.  The third type of explanation raises \nquestions about the simultaneous influences of media on all fields and possibly on the \nwhole of social space, exactly the type of explanation that field research would normally \nrule out on principle. Yet Bourdieu\u2019s account of television does not satisfactorily resolve \nthe choice between these alternative explanatory paths.  \n \n 14 \nA similar problem emerges in Patrick Champagne\u2019s work on media. Champagne31 in \nFaire L\u2019Opinion analyses the media\u2019s impacts on contemporary politics through an \naccount of the complex interrelations of the journalistic and the political field. The \njournalistic field has a relationship with the political field so close that Champagne is \ntempted to refer to it as \u2018a journalistic-political field\u2019 or \u2018space\u2019.32. That relationship, \nargues Champagne, has transformed the definition of politics,33 but not for the good. The \npolitical field has become increasingly insulated from external influences and conflicts \n(i.e. from those that politicians are meant to represent). By a \u2018circular logic\u2019,34 both \njournalists and politicians \u2018react\u2019 to a version of public opinion which they have largely \nconstructed, through the framing of questions for opinion polls, the reported reactions to \nthose polls\u2019 results, and through the influence of journalists\u2019 accounts of politics. The \nsame circular logic constrains those outside the political hierarchy who might otherwise \nbreak through it; two decades after Baudrillard,35 but with much greater sociological \nauthority, Champagne36 argues that demonstrations are often created for the media, as a \nmeans of communicating through, and therefore on the terms of, the media.37  \n \nThere is much that is interesting here, but the question again is its theoretical \ncompleteness. First, there is something like a sleight of hand in the idea that the \npreviously separate journalistic and political fields have merged. This enables \nChampagne to talk of the influence of journalists\u2019 definitions of \u2018events\u2019 on politicians\u2019 \ndefinitions of events, without addressing the crucial difficulty: how exactly have \nrepresentations made by actors in one field come to have such influence on the actions \nand thoughts of across in another field? Elsewhere, Champagne attempts to harness the \n 15 \nquestion of media influence on non-media actors back into field theory by claiming that \npeople\u2019s differential ability to work well with the media somehow reflects, by a \nhomology, the structures of capital in the fields to which those actors primarily belong:  \n \nEverything happens as if the journalistic event was a transposed form, in the relatively \nautonomous logic of the journalistic field, of the economic, institutional, cultural or \nsymbolic capital which social groups [wanting to be represented in the media] have at \ntheir disposal [i.e. for application in their own fields].38  \n \nIt is unclear however how this homology works. Interestingly, Champagne introduces the \nnotion of a new specific type of capital - \u2018media capital\u2019 (capital m\u00e9diatique)39 to capture \npeople\u2019s relative ability to influence journalistic events.40 But there is only the briefest \nexplanation of this new term,41 even though it implies an effect that field theory cannot \neasily encompass. Where, we might ask, is media capital acquired and exercised? In the \nmedia field or in the (political, medical, academic, etc) field where the agent in question \nprimarily acts? Perhaps the point of the term \u2018journalistic-political field\u2019 is that such \nquestions don\u2019t matter when analysing the media\u2019s interactions with politics. But suppose \nwe repeated this move in explaining all non-media fields and their relation to media. The \nresult would be either to fuse all fields influenced by media into a single \u2018journalistic-\ncultural field\u2019 or to generate a whole parallel set of hybrid \u2018journalistic-specialist\u2019 fields \n(medical, political, and so on) each with its own version of \u2018media capital\u2019. Either way, \nthe strength of the field model \u2013 its differentiation of the specific dynamics of particular \nfields - would have been blunted.  \n 16 \n \nThe difficulty can be illustrated further by returning to Champagne and Marchetti\u2019s \nanalysis of the changing interrelations of media and medical fields around the AIDS \ncrisis in late 1980s France.42 Our concern here is solely with the way the causal \ninterrelation of these two fields is theorised.43 What is striking in Champagne and \nMarchetti\u2019s discussion is a dissonance between their detailed explication of the changing \ndynamics of, respectively, the subfield of medicine-focussed journalists and the medical \nfield, and their very bold statements about \u2018the growing omnipresence and power accrued \nto the media and particularly television\u2019.44 Their analysis of the latter is concerned \nparticularly with the ability of television to define and then generally impose a particular \ndefinition of the medical \u2018scandal\u2019 which cut across older, more nuanced and \nscientifically accountable definitions of medical news: \n \n[1] So the power of the press in the constitution of \u2018scandals\u2019 is fundamental, not the \npower of the \u201cpress of scandals\u201d [yellow press]  . . . but that of the main press [la \ngrande presse] and especially the Parisian press. It is without doubt hardly an \nexaggeration to say that what is \u2018scandalous\u2019 is what the journalistic field, acting \ntogether, considers as such and goes on to impose on everyone [parvient surtout \u00e0 \nimposer \u00e0 tous] . . . [2] What is astonishing in the affair of the contaminated blood is \nthat the qualification of facts as scandalous, far from being evident and immediate, has \nbeen the result of a singular battle which notably opposed, over many months, certain \nvictims of the blood contamination against the State, the judiciary and journalists, then \n 17 \nopposed journalists to the medical and political sectors, and finally opposed journalists \nagainst each other.45   \n \nAgain note the disjuncture between the second process described (the various inter-field \nfactors which contributed to the definition of this particular case of contaminated blood \nas a scandal) and the first process (the general power of journalists acting together (dans \nson ensemble) to define whatever is \u2018scandalous\u2019 and impose that definition across the \nboard). The first process cannot be reduced to the second, since the latter is general and \nthe former is specific; why not argue, for instance, that the contaminated blood scandal \nwas a wholly exceptional instance, resting on a very specific historical coincidence of \nbattles in the journalistic and medical fields? If so, the first process needs its own \nexplanation: how exactly is it that the main press can \u2018impose\u2019 their definitions \u2018on all\u2019 \nand who do we mean by \u2018all\u2019? Just some (but an ever increasing number of) specialist \ncultural fields? Or all fields? Or the whole of social space, including newspaper readers, \nsome of whom may not belong to any field and certainly not the journalistic or medical \nfields? \n \nIt is striking that readers of these press debates are largely absent from Champagne and \nMarchetti\u2019s account, apart from a passing reference: \n \nSo a vision of things is collectively constructed which owes all its force to the fact that \nit is close to what preexists in the popular consciousness, journalists never having \n 18 \nmore force on these occasions than when they speak to \u2018[public] opinion\u2019 what it \nwants to hear.46 \n \nBenson plausibly reads this as a hegemony-style argument,47 but if so, like any hegemony \nstyle argument, it must say something about the impacts of hegemonic representations on \nthose who are assumed to believe them. This is precisely what cannot be done \nsatisfactorily within the confines of a field-based account, because many or most of those \nover whom hegemony is assumed to be exercised are not members of the fields in \nquestion; they may be professionals who belong to other fields or people who belong no \nfield at all. \n \nThe point here is that field-based accounts of media are irrevocably pushed towards a \ntype of explanation which spills out beyond the field model \u2013 if that is they are to sustain \nthe bold claims about the media\u2019s broader \u2018symbolic power\u2019 which gives this analysis \nmuch of its critical edge.  \n \nAt this point we need to be clear about what exactly we mean by \u2018symbolic power\u2019. \nThere is a weak and a strong definition of symbolic power between which we must \nchoose. John Thompson\u2019s work48 valuably insists on the symbolic as an important \ndimension of power alongside the political and the economic. Thompson defines \n\u2018symbolic power\u2019 as the \u2018capacity to intervene in the course of events, to influence the \nactions of others and indeed to create events, by means of the production and \ntransmission of symbolic forms\u2019.49 This definition helpfully captures in general terms the \n 19 \npower of a number of social institutions over symbolic production: the media, the church, \neducational institutions. But it is a weak concept of symbolic power, because it does not \nallow for the possibility that certain types of concentration of symbolic power (for \nexample in media institutions) require a special analysis.  In particular, Thompson50rules \nout a possibility, suggested by Bourdieu\u2019s work, that certain forms of symbolic power are \nnecessarily misrecognised. A strong concept of symbolic power, by contrast, suggests \nthat some concentrations of symbolic power are so great that they dominate the whole \nsocial landscape; as a result, they seem so natural that they are misrecognised, and their \nunderlying arbitrariness becomes difficult to see. In this way, symbolic power moves \nfrom being a merely local power (the power to construct this statement, or make this \nwork of art) to being a general power, what Bourdieu once called a \u2018power of \nconstructing [social] reality\u2019.51 It is the second, strong definition of symbolic power that \nBourdieu presumably has in mind when he talks of the symbolic power of television. \nSuch symbolic power legitimates key categories with both cognitive and social force52 \nand is defined \u2018in the very structure of the field in which belief is produced and \nreproduced\u2019.53 This power, although it is relevant to the way certain types of capital are \nconstituted as symbolic capital in the context of particular fields, is relevant also to the \nwider field of power, and indeed social space as a whole. How exactly the media\u2019s \nsymbolic power in this broad sense should be theorised consistently with field theory is, \nas we shall see, illuminated by Bourdieu\u2019s late writings on the state. \n \n(c) The Media as Symbolic System \n \n 20 \nThis problem can be reformulated as a question about the treatment of symbolic power in \nBourdieu\u2019s work more generally. \n \nThe analysis by Champagne and Marchetti of the media\u2019s growing influence over the \nmedical field turns, as we have seen, on the pervasive influence of specific definitions of \nthe \u2018scandalous\u2019 produced in a medical context. But this notion of \u2018scandal\u2019, whatever the \norigins of its formulation in particular cases, has much wider usage; it is arguably central \nto our understanding of the media\u2019s impacts on social space.54 This opens a connection \nwith a rather different type of argument (unconnected with field theory) found in \nBourdieu\u2019s writings: the construction of the socially resonant systems of categories that \nBourdieu calls \u2018symbolic systems\u2019. In an early lecture on \u2018symbolic power\u201955 Bourdieu \nused the term \u2018symbolic system\u2019 to describe both the university system and much earlier \nreligious systems which each had authority to classify social space as a whole. Behind \nthis lies Bourdieu\u2019s original Durkheimian notion that religious institutions exercise a \n\u2018monopoly of the legitimate exercise of the power to modify . . . the practice and world-\nview of lay people\u2019.56 A version of this idea pervades Bourdieu\u2019s whole sociology of \neducation; it is present also in his interesting essays on \u2018rites of institution\u2019 and \u2018symbolic \npower\u2019,57 which were developed in part with reference to societies without highly \ncomplex differentiations of labour.58 Crucially the concept of symbolic systems (having \nbeen developed before fields came to dominate Bourdieu\u2019s research agenda) implies an \nexplanatory framework which cuts across field theory. For a \u2018symbolic system\u2019 is a \nstructure of misrecognition that works precisely because of its pervasiveness across social \nspace, because of its totalising force.   \n 21 \n \nIs it possible that the gaps we found in field theory-based accounts of the media can be \naddressed by using concepts (such as symbolic system), which are not tied to the \nexplanatory framework of the field?  This would, first, have the merit of linking recent \nwork on media within the Bourdieu tradition more closely to other areas of Bourdieu\u2019s \nwork. Specifically, it would clarify the persistence in, for example, Champagne\u2019s work of \nterms more natural in that earlier context, such as \u2018consecration\u2019,59 that is the media\u2019s \nability to sanctify certain things as having primary importance.60 Second, and more \nimportant, a connection to Bourdieu\u2019s concept of symbolic systems allows into view the \nimpacts which media might have on all fields simultaneously by legitimating certain \ncategories with not just cognitive but also social significance.61 This is the type of general \nmedia influence that, at the beginning of this article, I noted was difficult to integrate into \nproduction-focussed analyses.  \n \nThis suggestion is encouraged by consideration of Bourdieu\u2019s later work on the French \nstate. Bourdieu62 takes over and extends Weber\u2019s63 notion of the state, conceptualising \nthe state  as a monopoly of legitimate physical and symbolic violence. In this context he \nis required to make an important distinction: between (a) the level at which the state\u2019s \nown power (its symbolic power) is established and (b) the field in which agents (civil \nservants, politicians, and all those passing through the \u00e9lite schools which, under the \nFrench system, control access to state positions) compete for the \u2018monopoly over the \nadvantages attached to [the state\u2019s] monopoly\u2019.64 The former (a) Bourdieu refers to as the \n\u2018field of power\u2019 focussed on the state.65 What is the nature of the power the state \n 22 \nexercises? Bourdieu has in mind not so much a power to act in the context of this or that \nspecialist field, but preeminence over the definitions, for example, of legal and \neducational status.66 The state\u2019s influence as a reference-point in social life works not in \none field only, but across all fields.67 The \u2018field of power\u2019 of which the state is the central \nreference-point is not therefore, I suggest, a \u2018field\u2019 in Bourdieu\u2019s normal sense. Rather it \nis better understood as a general space where the state exercises influence (very much \nlike a general symbolic power) over the interrelations between all specific fields (in the \nusual sense),68 indeed, perhaps, acts upon social space in general. We are close here to \nthe issue Craig Calhoun69 identifies, of how to understand the increasing \u2018convertibility\u2019 \nof different types of capital across the whole range of fields. The state (certainly not only \nthe French state, even if the forms of influence vary in different countries) adds a specific \ndimension to this issue, because of its increasing influence over the educational field \nthrough which everyone passes (and indirectly therefore over the key entry-points into all \nor most specific fields of production). What is striking, however, is that Bourdieu never \nconnected his or his fellow researchers\u2019 work on the media back to his theory of symbolic \nsystems or the state,70 notwithstanding the connections made elsewhere71 between media \nand politics.  \n \nCan Bourdieu\u2019s late work on the state help us grasp how the media exercise a similar \ninfluence on social space, including all specialist fields of production?  \n \nMetacapital: From State to Media \n \n 23 \nIn the discussions that form Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, Bourdieu was asked \nwhether the state is a sort of \u2018meta-field\u2019.72 His answer strikingly centres on the notion \nnot so much of field, but of capital:  \n \nThe concentration of  . . . different types of capital goes hand in hand with the rise and \nconsolidation of the various fields [i.e. the specific fields which historically have \ncontributed to the power of the state]. The result of this process is the emergence of a \nspecific capital, properly statist capital, born of their cumulation, which allows the \nstate to wield a power over the different fields and over the various forms of capital \nthat circulate in them. This kind of meta-capital capable of exercising a power over \nother species of power, and particularly over their rate of exchange . . . defines the \nspecific power of the state. It follows that the constitution of the state goes hand in \nhand with the constitution of the field of power understood as the space of play in \nwhich holders of various forms of capital struggle in particular for power over the \nstate, that is, over the state\u2019s capital over the different species of capital and over their \nreproduction (via the school system in particular).73  \n \nWhile the \u2018field of power\u2019 \u2018above\u2019 particular fields is a term of long-standing in \nBourdieu\u2019s work, what is significant here is the structured way Bourdieu sees the state\u2019s \nown ability to influence what can count as capital in other specific fields. First, Bourdieu \nsees as a key influence on all fields a force external to them, the workings of the state. \nThe state acts directly on the infrastructure of all fields: it is \u2018the site of struggles, whose \nstake is the setting of the rules that govern the different social games (fields) and in \n 24 \nparticular, the rules of reproduction of those games\u2019.74 Put another way, the state \ninfluences the hierarchical relationship or \u2018exchange rate\u201975 between the fundamental \ntypes of capital at stake in each individual field (for example, economic versus cultural \ncapital).76 This power of the state is, crucially, not derived from the workings of any \nspecific field, even if it is quite possible to think of the immediate space of competition \nbetween, say, civil servants as a \u2018field\u2019 in its own right. As to the scope of this power, it \npresumably includes, although Bourdieu does not mention this specifically, influence \nover what counts as \u2018symbolic capital\u2019 in each particular field. The concept of \u2018symbolic \ncapital\u2019 in Bourdieu generally means any type of capital (economic, cultural, and so on) \nthat happens to be legitimated or prestigious in a particular field,77 but the concept of \nmetacapital introduces the possibility that definitions of prestige within specific fields \nmay be determined by influences outside those fields, specifically the state\u2019s metacapital. \n \nBy analogy, I want to propose that we understand media power also as a form of \u2018meta-\ncapital\u2019 through which media exercise power over other forms of power. This gives \nclearer theoretical shape to Bourdieu\u2019s own most interesting insights about the media. \nWhen Bourdieu discusses the increasing pressure of television on, say, the academic \nfield,78 there is of course a direct economic dimension (a large television audience means \nmore books sold), but television exerts also, he suggests, an indirect pressure by \ndistorting the symbolic capital properly at stake in the academic field, creating a new \ngroup of academics whose symbolic capital within the academic field rests partly on their \nappearances on television. There is no reason to suppose this type of shift occurs in just \none field and not other fields; on the contrary, it is plausibly occurring widely across the \n 25 \nwhole field of specialist production fields, so that we need an overarching concept such \nas \u2018meta-capital\u2019 to capture it.  \n \nImmediately, the question arises how these two types of metacapital  - the state\u2019s and the \nmedia\u2019s - interrelate: I return to this in the conclusion. For now, let us concentrate on how \nthe media\u2019s own metacapital might work, in particular how it might interact with the \nconditions obtaining in specific fields. Why assume that its influence is limited to specific \nfields of production? Just as the state\u2019s influence on cultural capital and prestige through \nthe school system (part of what Bourdieu refers to as the state\u2019s meta-capital) is not \nconfined to specific fields but radiates outward into social space generally, so the media\u2019s \nmeta-capital may impact on social space through the general circulation of media \nrepresentations. All actors in specific fields are likely also to be actors in general social \nspace and general consumers of media messages. This suggests that the media\u2019s \nmetacapital over specific fields might operate in two distinct ways: first, as Bourdieu \nexplicitly suggests for the state, by influencing what counts as capital in each field; and \nsecond, through the media\u2019s legitimation of influential representations of, and categories \nfor understanding, the social world that, because of their generality, are available to be \ntaken up in the specific conflicts in any particular field. The second type of influence \nwould take us into the media\u2019s agenda-setting role across many specific areas of life,79 \nand the media\u2019s role as the \u2018frame\u2019 within which the generality of social \u2018issues\u2019 get \nexpressed and settled.80 Should we indeed understand the media as affecting the habitus \nof individual agents in all fields - a more radical causal link between media and what \ngoes on in particular fields?81 Clearly to pursue this would require an article in itself. \n 26 \nInstead, let us concentrate on the first, more direct, way of understanding how the \nmedia\u2019s meta-capital might work.  \n \nWe might understand the media as altering what counts as symbolic capital in particular \nfields through its increasing monopoly over the sites of social prestige. Indeed, by \naltering in parallel what counts as symbolic capital in a range of different fields, media \nmay affect the \u2018exchange rate\u2019 between the capital competed for in different fields \n(Bourdieu makes just this point in relation to the state\u2019s meta-capital). This is quite \nconsistent with Bourdieu\u2019s point that capital is only realised by agents in specific forms \nin specific fields.82 The symbolic capital (among, say, chefs) that derives from doing a \nsuccessful television cookery series is not necessarily convertible into symbolic capital in \na very different field, such as the academic field; this is because the former need involve \nfew, if any, of the specific attributes valued by media in representatives of the latter. But \nthis does not make the parallel structural transformation by media of the conditions \noperating in all fields any less significant, nor rule out the possibility that media-based \nsymbolic capital developed in one field can under certain conditions be directly \nexchanged for symbolic capital in another field. So in Britain recently a well-known \ntelevision gardener has quickly become a successful popular novelist; clearly this \ndepends the pole of the field of cultural production (mass production or specialist) to \nwhich you are closest. Even so, the relationship between media as institutions and all \nother fields (from politics to the visual arts to sport) has been transformed, when being a \nplayer in the former has a significant chance of bringing with it influence over the terms \non which people acquire symbolic capital in the latter. When the media intensively cover \n 27 \nan area of life for the first time (in the past decade, gardening or cooking), they alter the \ninternal workings of that sub-field and increase the ambit of the media\u2019s meta-capital \nacross the social terrain. This is one important way in which over time media institutions \nhave come to benefit from a truly dominant concentration of symbolic power (\u2018symbolic \npower\u2019 in the strong sense, of a power over the construction of social reality).  \n \nIt is important to emphasise, however, that this analysis does not supersede the accounts \nof the journalistic field discussed in section 1, any more than Bourdieu\u2019s concept of the \nstate\u2019s metacapital rules out analysing government bureaucracy in terms of a field of \nthose who work for the state. The wider implication, however, of Bourdieu\u2019s work on \nstate power, which I am extending to media power, is that in contemporary, highly \ncentralised societies certain institutions have a specific ability to influence all fields at \nonce. This links Bourdieu\u2019s field theory more explicitly with his other work on symbolic \npower and symbolic systems, for what is at stake at the level of metacapital is precisely \nthe type of definitional power across the whole of social space which the latter concepts \ncapture.  \n \nThere is much of course that could be said further to justify the idea that media have \nmetacapital of this sort; I have tried to develop elsewhere a linked argument based on \ndetailed qualitative research.83 Instead, before concluding, let me look briefly at how this \ntheoretical idea might be empirically tested.  \n \n 28 \nWays forward for Empirical Research \n \nThere are a range of questions which could be asked about how the media\u2019s meta-capital \nis, or is not, progressively altering the operating conditions in any particular field of \nproduction: \n \n1. Is media exposure a significant, or even a predominant, form of symbolic capital in \nthat field? (Clearly, for every (sub-)field there are detailed questions about what sort \nof media exposure counts there, and these are answerable only in terms of the \ncategorisations operating in that (sub-)field, but the importance of the general \nquestion remains; examples of (sub-)fields where this question is worth investigating \nhave already been mentioned, such as gardening or cookery, and other examples will \nbe discussed below) \n2. If the answer to (1) is yes, to what extent is this changing that field\u2019s relationship to \nother fields where media exposure is also regarded as a significant component of \nsymbolic capital, by allowing successful players in the former to exchange their \nsuccess there for symbolic capital in the latter?  \n3. Against the background of (1) and (2), we can turn to the questions more regularly \nasked previously within field theory: what are the conditions of entry into the \nspecialised media production field (and all its sub-fields), and how are those \nconditions changing as media-derived capital becomes significant increasingly across \nthe whole range of fields?  \n \n 29 \nThese questions raise a further important issue (4): will the increasing influence of media \nover what counts as symbolic capital across all fields lead, in the longer-term, to the \nincreasing convertibility of media-derived symbolic capital derived across social space as \na whole? If so, is a new form of capital (that we might, following Champagne, call \n\u2018media capital\u2019) beginning to emerge: that is, capital for use in any field based on prestige \nobtained through media exposure? In the long term, \u2018media capital\u2019 might emerge in its \nown right as a new \u2018fundamental species of capital\u2019 that works as a \u2018trump card\u2019 in all \nfields84 - just as economic capital is, and for the same reason: because of its high degree \nof exchangeability or liquidity85 - even if the means by which \u2018media capital\u2019 can be \naccumulated or exchanged distinguish it sharply from economic capital. For now, \nhowever, this last point must remain speculative.  \n \nThese questions intersect with existing work and debates on the media\u2019s influence on \nparticular fields. First, the idea that the political field is being transformed fundamentally \nby politicians\u2019 need for media exposure has been familiar for some time;86 Champagne\u2019s \nsuggestion of the fusion of the political and media fields (noted above) is also relevant \nhere. Second,  Bourdieu\u2019s own strictures on television\u2019s distortion of the proper values of \nthe academic field87 offer at least a provocation to research into how academics\u2019 notions \nof symbolic capital are being changed through media, but detailed research needs to be \ndone. A third interesting area is the visual arts, where (as Julian Stallabrass has argued)88 \nmedia exposure has increasingly become the stuff of artistic success, as well as the \nsubject of artistic reflection (Tracey Emin\u2019s and Gavin Turk\u2019s work, to name just two UK \nartists of international reputation). Particularly difficult, if potentially also the most far-\n 30 \nreaching in its consequences, would be research on the economic field: to what extent is \nmedia exposure becoming not only a sign of prestige among business players, but an \nasset that can be directly converted into economic capital? In limited forms such as \u2018stars\u2019 \nor \u2018brands\u2019, this has long been the case,89 but there is a more general question about how \nfar media exposure as a token of anticipated economic success makes something like \n\u2018media capital\u2019 increasingly integral to business at all levels. Qualitatively rich studies of \ncontemporary business and finance cultures and their interrelations with the media field \nwould be welcome.  \n \nThese questions, in effect, continue Bourdieu\u2019s interest in \u2018the production of belief\u2019,90 but \napply it across all fields and their interrelations. We need to study the categories (in a \nDurkheimian sense) through which an increasingly pervasive \u2018mediatization\u201991 of public \nand private life may be becoming normalised, even legitimated.  \n \nConclusion \n  \nThis article has developed in theoretical terms a proposal for supplementing existing \nfield-based accounts of the media\u2019s operations with an analysis of the media\u2019s meta-\ncapital over all fields and social space. The aim has been to open up possible answers to \nquestions unresolved in purely field-based accounts of media. The aim has also been to \nshow how, by a modest extension of the field-based model that draws on the rest of \nBourdieu\u2019s conceptual framework, we can more satisfactorily deal with the difficulty of \n 31 \nexplaining media as both production process and symbolic system with which the article \nbegan.  \n \nThere remain, however, some unsettled theoretical questions. First, what is the \nrelationship between the media and the state, and their respective meta-capitals? Leaving \naside the possibility that we should see the media as part of the state,92 which seems \nconfusing at best, this difficult question can be only be taken forward through empirical \nexplorations which (as Loic Wacquant has suggested for the state itself) need to be \nbrought together on a global, comparative basis.93 They will involve detailed analysis of \nhow the state and media compete as reference-points for defining key terms in specific \nfields: one example might be the definitions in play in the regulation of crime, where the \nmedia\u2019s impacts on perceptions of the \u2018crime problem\u2019 are attracting increasing attention \nfrom sociologists.94 Second, what is the relationship between the media\u2019s and\/or the \nstate\u2019s meta-capital  and that, potentially, of other central social institutions - the \neducational system, religious institutions, corporate power? We might even want to \nconceive of Bourdieu\u2019s field of power entirely openly as a space where media, state and \nthese other institutions compete for definitional power (metacapital) over specific fields. \nCertainly there are interesting (again comparative) questions to be considered here, \nalthough it is more plausible, as Bourdieu\u2019s treatment of the state\u2019s metacapital suggests, \nto see the state as the cumulative concentration of the definitional powers of earlier \nsymbolic systems (such as the educational system) which have now been absorbed into \nthe state. It is the historically established ability of the state to range across many \ndifferent fields that justifies attributing to it metacapital; only the media, I suggest, are \n 32 \nplausible rivals to the state here in most contemporary societies, in which case the second \nquestion soon reduces to the first. Third, it is important in formulating such questions to \nbear in mind the global space of power in which these processes are played out, \nparticularly when the usefulness of the national framework for sociological questions has \nrecently been challenged.95 It remains, however, to be seen, notwithstanding the growing \nimportance of global media flows, whether the key social fields of contestation are \noperating on other than a national level. Clearly there are difficult questions here of \nintegrating national and transnational scales into field theory. Finally, as noted earlier, the \nlong-term impacts of recent less centralised means of media production and distribution \n(especially the Internet) on both the media field and the media\u2019s meta-capital will need to \nbe considered. Once again, the answers will lie not in general theorisation but in detailed \nanalysis of how and in what ways and to what extent the rules, categories, and capital on \nthe basis of which agents in particular fields orientate themselves towards media \ninstitutions are changing.  \n \nThe unanswerability of such questions here is not, however, a fault of the preceding \nanalysis, but an example of the continued stimulation which Bourdieu\u2019s field model can \nprovide to new forms of empirical research on the workings of media power. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis article has benefited in particular from detailed criticisms of an earlier version by \nRod Benson and David Swartz.
