And why not? After decades of \nimplacable opposition both the Labour Government and Conservative Opposition \nhave expressed support for a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for Britain.  \nPerhaps surprisingly, it is the Liberal Democrats, the long time supporters of a \nbill of rights, who have  expressed strong reservations about the way the current \ndebate is being framed.  \nWhy? Well partly because it feels like only yesterday that the Human Rights Act \n(HRA), which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) \ninto UK law just 8 years ago, was itself widely regarded as a bill of rights. When \nthe ECHR was drafted after World War Two, largely at the behest of the British \ngovernment, all UK political parties took the view that, unlike most of the rest of \nEurope, it should not become part of domestic law (although the consequence of \nratifying the ECHR was that successive governments \u2013 but not public authorities \nor the courts \u2013 became subject to the rulings of the European Court of Human \nRights in Strasbourg). After a sustained campaign over many years, spearheaded \nby pressure groups like Charter 88 and Liberty, the New Labour government \nrelented and passed the HRA.  \nThe HRA was always intended to be more than the incorporation of a human \nrights treaty into domestic law. Like all bills of rights, it was deliberately crafted \nas a \u2018higher law\u2019, to which all other law and policy must conform where possible. \nIt empowers the judges to hold the executive to account and review Acts of \nParliament in a manner without precedent in British constitutional history, but \nstopping short of allowing unelected courts from striking down Acts of \nParliament; 18 statutes have been declared incompatible with human rights.1 \n                                                          \n1 26 declarations of incompatibility have been made; 18 are still standing, 8 have been overturned \non appeal. \n 2 \nThe HRA does not bind the UK courts to follow the judgments of the European \nCourt of Human Rights; only to \u201ctake [them] into account\u201d (s.2 HRA). Our judges \ncan, and have, developed their own case law while generally keeping pace with \nthe European Court: declaring indefinite detention without trial incompatible \nwith the HRA, reducing the scope of \u2018control orders\u2019, extending both free \nexpression and personal privacy and providing landmark rulings for elderly and \ndisabled people, gay and lesbian families, asylum seekers, Gypsies and Travellers \nand others who have no alternative means of protection. These features explain \nwhy in a speech to the IPPR in 2000 the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw, \ndescribed the HRA as \u201cthe first Bill of Rights this country has seen for three \ncenturies\u201d. He was expressly supported in this view by some Conservative MPs, \nwho opposed the Act for that very reason. \nSpeaking in defence of the HRA on the 60th Anniversary of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights in December, Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal \nDemocrats, pronounced that \u201cWe need a clear and responsible stand on the \nHuman Rights Act\u2026Human Rights are not something you pick up one day and \nput down the next.\u201d \nTo make sense of the pronouncements and positions of the leading political \nparties on this issue it is useful to have in mind George Orwell\u2019s Politics and the \nEnglish Language published in 1946. \u201cPolitical language\u201d, Orwell observed, \u201cand \nwith variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to \nAnarchists, is designed\u2026  to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d. \n\u2018Solid,\u2019 or \u2018wind\u2019, \u2013 how do we judge the main arguments in support of a British  \nBill of Rights and Responsibilities? The case is advanced around five main issues: \nsecurity, the judges, parliamentary sovereignty, responsibilities and \u2018British\u2019 \nrights and values. \nSecurity \nIn 2006 David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party, kicked off the \ncurrent \u2018debate\u2019 with a promise to \u201creplace\u201d the HRA with a British Bill of Rights \nwhilst staying signed up to the ECHR; a policy his Secretary of State for Business, \nKen Clarke dismissed as \u201cxenophobic and legal nonsense\u201d.2 \nCameron has repeated this commitment to \u201cabolish\u201d the HRA several times since. \nWhy? The most consistent argument advanced is that the HRA \u201chas made it \nharder to protect our security. It is hampering the fight against crime and \nterrorism\u201d.3 Of particular concern to Mr Cameron is the (exaggerated) belief that \n\u201cwe\u2019ve got to a position where the Home Secretary doesn\u2019t seem able to deport \n                                                          \n2 Ken Clarke quoted in Daily Telegraph, 27.6.06. \n3 David Cameron, \u2018Balancing freedom and security \u2013 A modern British Bill of Rights\u2019,  Centre for \nPolicy Studies, 26\/06\/06. \n 3 \npeople who would put the country at risk.\u201d4 This is the same restriction on \nexecutive power that led former Labour Home Secretary John Reid to regret that \nhis government had ever introduced the HRA5 (although the government has \nsubsequently reinforced its support for the Act).6 \nIt is difficult to think of a precedent outside the former Soviet Union where the \ncase for constitutional rights has been made on the back of increasing the powers \nof the state. The contrast with Obama\u2019s reassertion of America\u2019s constitutional \nvalues could not be clearer \u201cOur security emanates from the justness of our \ncause; the force of our example; the tempering qualities of humility and \nrestraint,\u201d he memorably said in his Inaugural speech. Two days later he \nproceeded to sign Orders to close Guantanamo Bay and other secret detention \ncentres around the world and pledged not to deport detainees to countries where \nthey face torture. The (relatively few) deportations that have been prevented by \nour courts (stemming from Chahal v UK, a European Court of Human Rights \nruling which preceded the HRA) all revolve around a concern that the deportees \nwill be killed or tortured if they are returned to their home country.  \nThe judiciary  \n \nThe second, and perhaps even more unusual argument for replacing the HRA \nwith a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities proposed by the Conservative Party, \nrelates to the power of the judiciary. Cameron has advanced the case that a \nBritish Bill of Rights would somehow allow UK governments to ignore European \nCourt of Human Rights rulings it does not agree with, a proposition which has \nbeen demolished by research from Oxford University which demonstrated that, if \nanything, the reverse applies.7  \n \nThere is considerable muddle in this argument. Unless the UK were to leave the \nCouncil of Europe (and, in all probability, by extension the European Union), of \nwhich there is no realistic prospect, the government would remain bound by the \ndecisions of the Strasbourg court, even if the HRA were repealed. In that \nscenario, the ECHR would be de-incorporated from domestic law, individuals \nwould not be able to assert Convention rights in our courts and public authorities \nwould no longer be required to act compatibly with the values and standards the \nConvention upholds. But that would not exempt the government from complying \nwith unpopular judgments from the European Court of Human Rights, including \nthe prohibition on deportations  to countries where there is a risk of torture; the \nsubject of so much controversy in recent years.   \n                                                          \n4 Cameron on Cameron: Conversations with Dylan Jones, Fourth Estate, 2008 \n5 Interview in News of the World, 16 Sept 2007.   \n6 See Prime Minister\u2019s speech on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nLancaster House, London, 10 December 2008. \n7 Benjamin Goold, Liora Lazarus and Gabriel Swiney, Public protection, proportionality and the \nsearch for balance, University of Oxford, 2007. \n 4 \n \nEven if Cameron were right, and the repeal of the HRA were somehow to lead to \nthe \u2018get out clause\u2019 from European Court rulings that he seeks, to argue for a bill \nof rights on the basis that this would help to \u2018free\u2019 the UK from our international \nhuman rights obligations \u2013 specifically with regard to deportations to alleged \nplaces of torture \u2013 is the reverse of the direction that President Obama is taking \nAmerica. The Bush administration\u2019s arguments for American \u2018exceptionalism\u2019 are \nbeginning to be dismantled just as ours are growing. Obama has indicated that he \nwill abide by international human rights and humanitarian law; faithfulness to \nthe American constitution is not sufficient. \n \nParliamentary sovereignty  \n \nFormer Shadow Justice Minister, Nick Herbert, proposed an even more original \nconstitutional argument for a bill of rights than his Leader. Describing \u201cone of the \ngreatest impacts of the [Human Rights] Act\u201d as \u201cthe undermining of \nParliamentary sovereignty\u201d by \u201ctransfer[ing] significant power out of the hands of \nelected politicians into the hands of unelected judges,\u201d Herbert  maintained that \n\u201cessentially political questions\u201d should be \u201cdecided by Parliament\u201d not judges.8 \nThis is a perfectly credible argument for opposing bills of rights altogether, not \nfor introducing one!  \n \nHerbert is right that the HRA has made the executive more accountable to the \ncourts, but it is a fact that the HRA does not allow the judges to strike down Acts \nof Parliament, precisely to preserve \u2018parliamentary sovereignty\u2019. This is why Jack \nStraw, when he was Home Secretary, used to call the unique approach to \nenforcement adopted by the HRA the \u2018British model\u2019. If, under Herbert\u2019s \napproach, a bill of rights were to involve less judicial scrutiny than the HRA \nwould it be legally or constitutionally a bill of rights at all? Or would it be more \nlike \u2018the Emperor\u2019s clothes\u2019 or Orwell\u2019s aforementioned \u2018wind\u2019? \nResponsibilities \nWhilst Labour and the Conservatives express contrasting positions on the future \nof the HRA (however lukewarm the Government\u2019s support for the Act has \nappeared at times), they are united in supporting the  inclusion of responsibilities \nin any new bill of rights. David Cameron said in a speech in 2006,  \u201cA modern \nBritish Bill of Rights...should spell out the fundamental duties and \nresponsibilities of people living in this country both as citizens and foreign \nnationals.\u201d Dominic Grieve, Shadow Justice Secretary, was also quoted in the \nNorthern Ireland News Letter in January as saying that the Conservative Party \nintend to create a UK Bill of Rights which would have in-built safeguards to \nprevent those \u201cwhose own behaviour is lacking\u201d from abusing its powers.  \n                                                          \n8 Nick Herbert, Rights without Responsibilities - a decade of the Human Rights Act, British \nLibrary lecture, 24.11.08. \n 5 \nGiving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) in January,  \nJustice Secretary Jack Straw\u2018s main focus was to use the vehicle of a bill of rights \nto underline \u201cthe responsibilities we owe to each other and owe to the \ncommunity\u201d.9 He expressed himself \u201cstruck\u201d with the similarities between what \nthe government is proposing and the Netherlands who \u201chave their equivalent to \nthe Human Rights Act embodied in their constitution\u201d and are now considering a \n\u201cCharter for Responsible Citizenship\u201d. Members of the JCHR had difficulty tying \ndown what such references to responsibilities implied, with Straw insisting, that \n\u201cwe have never said that rights are contingent on responsibilities; that would be \nan absurdity and an affront to democratic society\u201d. In reality, any bill of rights \nand responsibilities which complies with the ECHR and does not overturn the \nframework of the HRA cannot make rights contingent on responsibilities or \nremedies dependent on good behaviour. However, there is room for taking the \nbehaviour of a claimant into account when deciding the level of any damages to \naward, in line with the already established approach of the European Court of \nHuman Right\u2019s approach (see for example Johnson v UK).   \nCritics of the HRA would  have considerable sympathy with the Justice \nSecretary\u2019s concern about the \u2018commoditisation\u2019 of rights, as he puts it, where \nrights are talked of in the same breath as consumer goods, to be chosen and \ndiscarded at will. But if there is evidence that such a culture has developed, it \nwould be a travesty of the post war vision of human rights which requires us all to \n\u201cact towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood\u201d (Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights 1948, Article 1). As Human Rights Minister Michael Wills has \nacknowledged on many occasions, responsibilities are \u201cinherent, and on occasion \nexplicit\u201d, in the HRA.10 The Government\u2019s concern appears to be to make these \n\u2018more explicit,\u2019 rather than to introduce new legally enforceable duties through \nthe vehicle of a bill of rights. If that is the case, the obvious point of departure is \nthe philosophy of the HRA, and the values of mutual respect and duties to the \ncommunity in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which it enshrines. \nThis is an issue of education and of leadership \u2013 principled and consistent \nleadership. There are no references to responsibilities or the rights of others in \nthe American Bill of Rights, and precious few (express) limitations on individual \nliberties. But this did not deter the new President of America in his Inaugural \nspeech from using the ethical values it signals to conjure \u201ca new era of \nresponsibility \u2013 a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties \nto ourselves, our nation and the world\u201d. \n \n                                                          \n9 Uncorrected Evidence to the JCHR, 20 January 2009. \n10  Michal Wills, Uncorrected Evidence to the JCHR, 20 January 2009 \n 6 \n\u2018British\u2019 rights and values \n Advocates of  a \u2018British bill of rights and responsibilities\u2019 point to the \u2018British \nrights\u2019 that are currently missing from the HRA, such as jury trial which can be \ntraced back to the Magna Carta. (Interestingly, the term \u2018British\u2019 has lately been \ndropped from Ministry of Justice descriptions of the proposed bill, presumably in \nrecognition of the fact that Northern Ireland has its own process and that \nScotland is likely to want a Scottish Bill if the government proposes a British \none.) It is not clear what other \u2018British rights\u2019 are proposed by the Conservatives. \nIn his lecture at the British Library Nick Herbert referred to \u201crights to \ngovernment information\u201d \u2013 but any cursory reading of the various speeches that \nhave been made in support of \u2018British rights\u2019 will be struck by the brevity of the \nlist. \n Whilst, as the Director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said in the Guardian in \nJanuary, no bills of rights are magic wands, and all of them have to balance \ndifferent rights and interests, it is perfectly possible to suggest additional rights to \nadd to, and improve on, the rights in the HRA. The Civil Liberties Trust in the \nearly 1990s drafted A People\u2019s Charter, a model bill of rights which drew on a far \nwider set of international human rights instruments than the ECHR. The \nInstitute of Public Policy Research and human rights bodies in Scotland and \nNorthern Ireland did likewise.  Included alongside a right to jury trial, was \nasylum, data protection, freedom of movement and children\u2019s rights.  \nLinked to the idea of adding new \u2018British\u2019 rights is the proposal to codify the \nprinciples of the welfare state and such \u2018British\u2019 institutions as the NHS. The \ngovernment has expressed support for the inclusion of economic and social  \nrights in a bill of rights, albeit ones that are not enforceable as individual \nentitlements, or even as rights to be \u2018progressively realised\u2019 as in the South \nAfrican model. A \u2018declaration of rights and responsibilities\u2019 setting out \u201cin a single \ndocument that to which people are entitled and that to which people owe\u201d \nappears to be what they have in mind.11 There is a credible argument that such an \naddition would be valuable, provided it had at least some minimal legal effect as \nan interpretative tool for the courts. It could even help to bed down the rights in \nthe HRA (assuming they are not tampered with) because of the wide appeal and \nrelevance of social and economic rights. But, in evidence to the JCHR in January, \nJack Straw said in terms that there would be no legislation this side of an \nelection.  \n \n                                                          \n11 Jack Straw, Uncorrected Evidence to the JCHR, 20 January 2009. \n 7 \nThere has been no support for the inclusion of such rights in a bill of rights by the \nConservative party; nor, for well rehearsed ideological and philosophical reasons, \nis there ever likely to be. In line with the Good Friday Agreement, The Northern \nIreland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC), which has been consulting on a bill \nof rights for ten years, presented the Government in December 2008 with a \nproposed Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland which included a range of \nsupplementary rights to the HRA, including economic and social rights. Dominic \nGrieve, was quoted in January in the Northern Ireland newspaper, News Letter, \nas saying that there is no need for a Bill of Rights for NI as envisaged and that \n\u201cwhat the Northern Ireland Commissioner has come up with makes my hair \nstand on end\u201d. We wait to see if the government has any appetite for including \nany of the additional justiciable rights the NIHRC proposes.  \nThe second aspect of the \u2018British\u2019 rights and values argument concerns procedure. \nThe greatest benefit of introducing a new bill of rights, we are told, is in the \nprocess that would lead to it. The HRA was never consulted upon and that has \nbeen its downfall. It is seen as a foreign import and what we need is a specifically \n\u2018British\u2019 bill of rights for the British people to feel \u2018ownership\u2019 of it.12 Both the \ngovernment and the Conservatives talk about using the process of consultation as \na vehicle to gain support for a new bill of rights. \nAt one level this is unarguable and is a crucial point. But it requires careful \nthought and consideration. The American Bill of Rights was not widely consulted \nupon in its day; and certainly not by the people who live more than 200 years \nlater. The same goes for the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the \nconstitutions that were bequeathed to countries all around the world with the \ndemise of the British empire. Even the Canadian Charter of Fundamental Rights \nand Freedoms, often pointed to as an exemplar of consultation, is largely drawn \nfrom the UN\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, another \n\u2018child\u2019, like the ECHR, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \nCharter was also very \u2018unpopular\u2019 in its first decade; and particular decisions of \nthe Supreme Court are still controversial today. This underlines a fundamental \npoint; no bill of rights will last long if it is buffeted by some contentious court \ndecisions made under it  \nAny consultation on a fresh bill of rights has to start from a position of honesty \nand leadership; the kind of leadership shown by President Obama in his \nInaugural speech, who declared that when we \u201cstand up for human rights, by \nexample at home and by effort abroad\u2026 We also strengthen our security and well \nbeing\u201d. In contrast, Jack Straw, \u2018the father\u2019 of the HRA, was quoted in the Daily \n                                                          \n12 See Dominic Grieve, \u2018Liberty and community in Britain\u2019, speech to the Conservative Liberty \nForum, 2 October 2006. \n 8 \nMail last December as saying there is a perception that the Act is \u201ca villains' \ncharter or that it stops terrorists being deported or criminals being properly given \npublicity,\u201d without adequately addressing this charge. It is self evident that the \nLabour Government has never given the HRA the sustained leadership it requires \nand has sometimes disparaged it. In 2005, when the then Prime Minister Tony \nBlair made a statement on anti-terror measures and told us \u201cthe rules of the game \nare changing\u201d, he also said \u201cshould legal obstacles arise, we will legislate further, \nincluding, if necessary amending the Human Rights Act\u201d. \nThe government has belatedly reinforced its commitment to the HRA. Michael \nWills told the JCHR in January, \u201cJust so that we are absolutely clear, we will \nbuild on the Human Rights Act. There is no question of changing it, so that legal \ncertainty remains.\u201d This is a much stronger commitment than the low threshold \ntest of conformity with the ECHR, as promised by the Conservatives. The JCHR \nstated in its 2008 report A Bill of Rights for the UK?, \u201cthe issue is not whether \nthe Bill of Rights is going to be compliant with the ECHR, which is a fairly low \nthreshold, but whether it is going to be \u2018HRA-plus\u2019, that is, add to and build on \nthe HRA as the UK\u2019s scheme of human rights protection.\u201d  \nIn December 2008 the Prime Minister said that \u201cwe should never forget that the \nuniversal rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration and in our Human Rights \nAct are a shield and a safeguard for us all\u201d.13 If this is the case, then any \nconsultation must provide a coherent explanation as to why we are seeking to \nadopt a new bills of rights? There is no point in pretending that their purpose is \nto replicate what the democratic process can do anyway \u2013 which is give voice to \nthe \u2018will of the majority\u2019. Bills of rights are there to defend individuals and \nminorities, of all kinds, whose voices will never be given equal weight through the \nballot box. They are there to make a reality of democracy\u2019s boast to represent the \nneeds of every individual, however marginal or unpopular (up to the point that \nthis breaches the rights of others).  \nSince the Second World War virtually every State in the world has formally \naccepted a set of values which reflects this understanding of democracy. This has \nto be the starting point for a consultation on a bill of rights. Not just because the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights requires it, but because this is the vision \ninherent in the post-war settlement that every member of the UN commits to as a \ncondition of membership. \nConclusion \nThe simple truth is that no bill of rights that respects these human rights values \nwill look very different to the HRA, certainly not weaker. A cursory glance at any \n                                                          \n13 Above, note 6. \n 9 \npost-war bill of rights will tell you this. The only significant departure is whether, \nas in the case of South Africa, they include economic, social and cultural rights \nwhich is not on the agenda of the likely next government.   \nWhen the leader of the Conservative Party promises \u201ca new solution that protects \nliberties in this country that is home-grown and sensitive to Britain's legal \ninheritance\u201d he conjures a different image.14 One that suggests that \u2018British \nliberties\u2019 are somehow fundamentally different to the human rights in the HRA, \nrather than an integral part of them. One that ironically ignores the richness of \nthis country\u2019s legacy which led Eleanor Roosevelt to proclaim the Universal \nDeclaration as the \u201cMagna Carta\u201d of all mankind and Winston Churchill to dream \nup the idea of the ECHR which was drafted largely by British lawyers.   \nChris Huhne, Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman, warned in February that \"It is \nessential that we don't abolish the Human Rights Act\u2026 we must remember why \nthe Human Rights Act is so important, as opposed to British rights\u2026. Any society \nat some point in the future can decide who its citizens are and who they are not. \nThat is what happened in Nazi Germany\u2026If we define rights as British, that is the \nrisk that we run again and we must not allow that to happen.\u201d15 \nWhen David Cameron says that we need \u201ca clear articulation of citizens\u2019 rights \nthat British people can use in British courts\u201d16 this suggests, even if unfairly, that \neligibility for this new bill of rights might depend on \u2018citizenship\u2019 rather than \n\u2018humanity\u2019 \u2013 that individuals who live here might be subject to the power of the \nstate but not the fundamental rights of its citizens. Above all it suggests that the \nglobal discourse on human rights, which has become the lingua franca of liberty \nstruggles throughout the world, does not sit comfortably in these islands. Where \nhave we heard this before; this argument for \u201cexceptionalism\u201d from universal \nhuman rights norms? In America after 9\/11? In Zimbabwe following a sham \nelection? In Israel in response to rocket attacks? If we were to become the first \ncountry in the democratic world to contemplate introducing a national bill of \nrights on the back of repealing a bill of rights which enshrines universal human \nrights norms, what does this say to the rest of the world?  \n \nFrancesca Klug, Professorial Research Fellow, LSE. \n                                                          \n14 Above, note 3. \n15 Speech at the Convention on Modern Liberty, 28 February 2009. \n16 Above, note 3. \n"}
