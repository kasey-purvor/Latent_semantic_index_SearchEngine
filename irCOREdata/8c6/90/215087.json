However, the partisan context of cabinet decisions remains underexplored, the \nfindings are based on small samples and the variables of interest are often poorly \noperationalised. Using a new dataset of spending ministers and partisan fragmentation in \nthe cabinets of 58 countries between 1975 and 1998, I find a strong positive association \nbetween the number of spending ministers and budget deficits and expenditures, as well \nas weaker evidence that these effects increase with partisan fragmentation. \n \nKeywords: Cabinet; Fiscal policy; Political parties. \n \nJEL classification: H11, H61, H62. \n\t\r \u00a0 4 \nThe outcome of the annual budget process is crucial in the competition amongst cabinet \nministers for political standing. As one minister sums up the effect of budgetary decisions \non his career prospects:1 \u2018If that bugger in transport gets more money than me, I look like \na loser.\u2019 Such individual level incentives to boost spending can have profound aggregate \nconsequences (Niskanen 1971; Von Hagen & Harden 1995). Cross-national studies find \nthat cabinet size or the number of spending ministers affects fiscal performance \n(Volkerink & De Haan 2001; Perotti & Kontopoulos 2002; Woo 2003; Ricciuti 2004). \nHowever, this literature suffers from several shortcomings. First, it gives insufficient \nconsideration to the possible interaction between the number of spending ministers and \nthe partisan context of bargaining over the budget. Second, sample size is limited and the \nextent to which the findings can be generalised beyond a few industrialised democracies \nremains unclear. Finally, the main variables of interest are often poorly operationalised, \nwhich raises doubts about the robustness of some of the results. These shortcomings \nprovide strong reasons to re-examine the relationship between cabinet structure and fiscal \nperformance.  \n \nThis article advances the literature on fiscal performance by addressing the above \nlimitations. I introduce a new dataset of the number of spending ministers and partisan \nfragmentation in a diverse sample of countries. The definition of spending ministers is \nclosely linked to the theoretical argument that certain cabinet members lack incentives to \ninternalise the full cost of their actions. The analysis shows a strong positive association \nbetween the number of spending ministers and central government budget deficits and \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n1 The comment was made under condition of anonymity. \n\t\r \u00a0 5 \nexpenditures. Moreover, I use data on the allocation of ministerial portfolios to explore \nwhether the effect of the number of spending ministers is conditional on the extent of \npartisan fragmentation in the cabinet. I find some evidence that political parties may be \nable to mitigate the profligate tendencies of individual spending ministers. Overall, my \nresults confirm that the structure of cabinet, and the number of spending ministers in \nparticular, is an essential determinant of fiscal policy outcomes. \n \nThe article has three main parts. Part one reviews cross-national studies that include \nevidence on the fiscal policy impact of cabinet size or the number of spending ministers \nas well as the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet. I pay particular attention to the \ndefinition of the variables of interest, sample characteristics and the estimated effects. \nThe second part introduces a new dataset of spending ministers and partisan \nfragmentation in the cabinets of 58 countries between 1975 and 1998, which forms the \nbasis of the empirical analysis presented here. This part also describes the remaining \nvariables, including indicators of fiscal performance as well as economic and political \ncontrols. Part three presents the statistical models and results. The conclusion explores \npolicy implications and possibilities for further research. \n \n \nBackground and hypotheses \n \nThe theoretical literature on the common pool resource problem in budgeting highlights \nthe adverse fiscal effects of fragmented decision making. Weingast, Shepsle and Johnsen \n\t\r \u00a0 6 \n(1981) express this as the \u2018law of 1\/n\u2019. In their model, expenditure can be targeted at a \nparticular geographical district, while costs are shared equally across all districts. This \nimplies that the larger the number of decision makers with separate constituencies, the \nsmaller the share of the tax burden each considers. As a result, assuming universalistic \nlogrolls, \u2018the degree of inefficiency in project scale\u2026 is an increasing function of the \nnumber of districts\u2019 (p. 654). Von Hagen and Harden (1995) explore the fiscal impact of \ndifferent cabinet structures. Amongst others, they show that a process where spending \nministers independently develop their spending plans results in a budget that is larger \nthan optimal for the government as a whole. The larger the number of spending ministers, \nthe greater this spending bias. Elsewhere, Velasco (2000) demonstrates the effect of \nincreasing the number of special interests represented in fiscal policy decisions on \nspending, deficits and debt. Overall, this theoretical literature strongly cautions against a \nproliferation of fiscal decision makers.2 In the context of cabinet decision making, the \nrelevant fiscal actor can be either an individual minister or a political party, if the latter \noperates as \u2018a more or less cohesive entity representing the interests of specific groups\u2019 \n(Perotti & Kontopoulos 2002: 195; see also Volkerink & De Haan 2001: 222). \n \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n2 The common pool literature contrasts with veto player theory (Tsebelis 2002), according to which the \nnumber of decision makers and their ideological dispersion affect policy change, that is, the likelihood and \nmagnitude of departures from the status quo. The existence of multiple veto actors is associated with \ndelayed adjustment to economic shocks (Roubini & Sachs 1989; Alesina & Drazen 1991; Poterba 1994). \nThe literature on spending ministers is based on the common pool resource problem. It is beyond the scope \nof this paper to conduct a unified assessment of the two theories (see Franzese 2008). \n\t\r \u00a0 7 \nSeveral papers provide empirical evidence on the relationships amongst the number of \nspending ministers (or cabinet size), partisan fragmentation and fiscal outcomes. \nVolkerink and De Haan (2001) use a panel of 22 OECD countries over the period 1971 to \n1996 to investigate the effects of various indicators of fragmentation on deficits. One of \ntheir independent variables is the number of spending ministers, which they define as \u2018the \ntotal number of ministers in government\u2026 minus the ministers of finance and\/or the \nbudget and the prime minister\u2019 (p. 224). In their sample, the number of spending \nministers ranges between five and 33 and the average is about 15. They find a robust \npositive effect of this variable on central government deficits. According to their basic \nresults, the addition of one spending minister leads to a deterioration of the budget \nbalance by 0.08 per cent of GDP (p. 229). Their analysis also includes the effective \nnumber of parties in government, defined in accordance with Laakso and Taagepera \n(1979). Volkerink and De Haan (2001: 229) find that adding one effective party to the \ncoalition increases the deficit by 0.4 percentage points. They also report that the fiscal \neffects of an increase in the number of spending ministers and the effective number of \nparties in government are dampened as economic growth increases, although the paper \ndoes not contain a complete analysis of this interaction. However, they do not interact the \nnumber of spending ministers and the effective number of parties in government. \n \nPerotti and Kontopoulos (2002) use a panel of 19 OECD countries between 1970 and \n1995 to investigate the role of fragmentation in fiscal performance, including the number \nof spending ministers. Their operationalisation of this variable is based on counting a \nselection of sectoral portfolios plus finance ministers and related positions, such as \n\t\r \u00a0 8 \nministers responsible for the budget (p. 219). The inclusion of the latter does not make \ntheoretical sense, since a central role of finance ministers is to safeguard fiscal discipline \nvis-\u00e0-vis spending ministers (e.g., Von Hagen & Harden 1995; Schick 2001; Jensen et al. \n2003). I discuss this issue in detail in the following section. In addition, the count of \nportfolios by Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002) is highly selective and excludes important \nministries such as those relating to welfare and social assistance. In this sample, the \nmisleadingly labelled \u2018number of spending ministers\u2019 ranges between eight and 18 and \nhas a mean of about 11. Despite the poor operationalisation of this variable compared \nwith Volkerink and De Haan (2001), the conclusions are similar. Perotti and Kontopoulos \n(2002: 208) find that spending ministers are \u2018a very important and robust determinant of \nfiscal outcomes\u2019. They estimate that an additional ministry increases the general \ngovernment deficit by 0.12 percentage points of potential GDP per year, due to impacts \non spending. They also include the unweighted number of parties in the coalition as a \nmeasure of partisan fragmentation, but the estimates are not statistically significant in \nalmost all of their regressions. According to this analysis, an increase in unemployment \naccentuates the fiscal effects of spending ministers and parties in the coalition (pp. 213-\n214). The authors do not explore the interaction between the two variables. \n \nThe analysis of economic, political and institutional determinants of deficits by Woo \n(2003) is more comprehensive in terms of countries covered. He uses data comprised of \ndecade averages for 57 developed and developing countries for the periods 1970 to 1979 \nand 1980 to 1990. One of his independent variables is cabinet size, defined as the number \nof ministers. During the 1970s, cabinet size in this sample ranged between 11 and 36, \n\t\r \u00a0 9 \nwith a mean of about 19. During the 1980s, the range was from nine to 45 and the \naverage about 22. Woo finds a strong association with public sector deficits. He estimates \nthat adding one minister to the cabinet is associated with an increase in the deficit of the \npublic sector amounting to 0.2 per cent of GDP (p. 399). This analysis also includes \nindicators of coalition and minority government, as well as measures of partisan \nfragmentation in the legislature, but none of them is statistically significant at \nconventional levels. The author does not explore the possible interaction between the \npartisan fragmentation of the government and cabinet size. \n \nRicciuti (2004) analyses the association between fragmentation and fiscal policy \noutcomes using a panel of 19 OECD countries over the years 1975 to 1995. One of his \nindependent variables is the number of spending ministers, based on the definition by \nVolkerink and De Haan (2001). In this sample, the number of spending ministers varies \nbetween seven and 33 and the mean is about 16. According to the results, the number of \nspending ministers is the only \u2018consistently significant\u2019 determinant of the primary \nsurplus and primary expenditures of central government (Ricciuti 2004: 382). The \nestimated effects of an additional spending minister on the primary surplus and primary \nspending are -0.13 and 0.11 per cent of GDP, respectively (pp. 378 and 382). This study \nalso includes a measure of the partisan fractionalisation of the government based on the \nseat shares of the ruling parties in the lower house of the legislature. The variable has no \nstatistically significant effect on deficits (p. 378) and barely achieves significance at the \n10 per cent level in only one out of four expenditure regressions (p. 382). As in the three \n\t\r \u00a0 10 \nother papers reviewed above, the author does not explore the interaction between the \nnumber of spending ministers and the partisan fractionalisation of the government. \n \nIn sum, the cross-national literature on fiscal performance contains evidence that cabinet \nsize or the number of spending ministers affects budget outcomes.3 This finding appears \nto be robust to different operationalisations of this variable and to hold for several \nindicators of fiscal performance. On the other hand, the evidence on an association \nbetween partisan fragmentation in the executive and fiscal policy outcomes is much \nweaker. However, the existing literature also has a number of shortcomings, which I \ndiscuss in detail in the following paragraphs. \n \nFirst, previous work does not consider the potential interaction between partisan \nfragmentation and the number of spending ministers. If political parties can force their \nspending ministers to internalise a larger share of the costs than they otherwise would \n(Perotti & Kontopoulos 2002: 195), then a cabinet with a large number of spending \nministers should be less profligate if all of them belong to a single political party. Von \nHagen and Harden (1995: 775) recognise this possibility and speculate that party \ndiscipline may mitigate fiscal illusion, \u2018but most likely does not do so completely\u2019. To \nmy knowledge, this possible interaction has yet to be investigated empirically. Here, I \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n3 Other authors focus on the determinants of fiscal performance at the subnational level (see the review by \nKirchg\u00e4ssner 2001). Some of these consider equivalent measures of cabinet size or the number of spending \nministers as independent variables, for instance Ashworth and Heyndels (2005) in their analysis of Flemish \nlocal governments or Schaltegger and Feld (2009) in their study of Swiss cantons. \n\t\r \u00a0 11 \nconjecture that the fiscal effect of the number of spending ministers is conditional on the \npartisan fragmentation of the cabinet. \n \nA second limitation of existing empirical work is that the samples used are of modest \nsize. The evidence from OECD countries is based on less than 500 observations and a \nselection of the advanced industrialised democracies (Volkerink & De Haan 2001; Perotti \n& Kontopoulos 2002; Ricciuti 2004). While Woo (2003) expands the number of \ncountries, missing data forces him to work with pooled averages for two decades, which \nyields a maximum of less than 100 observations. In contrast, important recent \ncontributions to the empirical literature on the fiscal effects of constitutions (Persson & \nTabellini 2003) and political budget cycles (Brender & Drazen 2005) use much larger \nglobal samples. Such an approach can help to explore the generalisability or context \nconditionality of theories. The empirical study of fiscal institutions should follow suit and \nexpand beyond the usual suspects. \n \nA third critique is that the key variables of interest are not always precisely defined and \noperationalised. Notably, Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002) and Woo (2003) use indicators \nof cabinet size rather than spending ministers. However, the cabinet includes several \nactors who can be expected to internalise much of the cost of their actions. As Wildavsky \n(1975: 9) puts it, budgeting always involves \u2018spenders\u2019 and \u2018savers\u2019. More precisely, Von \nHagen and Harden (1995: 774) highlight that \u2018the prime minister and the finance \nminister\u2026 are not bound by the particular interests of a spending department and can be \nassumed to give more weight to the collective interest of the government\u2019. Alesina and \n\t\r \u00a0 12 \nPerotti (1996: 20-21) argue along similar lines: \u2018The constituencies of spending ministers \nare groups and industries who benefit from certain spending programs while, at least in \ntheory, the constituency of the Treasury Minister is the \u201caverage\u201d tax-payer. Thus the \nspending ministers do not internalize the aggregate costs of certain spending programs, \nwhile the Treasury has an incentive to internalize.\u2019 Both Volkerink and De Haan (2001) \nand Ricciuti (2004) use a more appropriate measure, excluding the chief executive and \nthe finance and\/or budget ministers.4 \n \nMoreover, the measures of partisan fragmentation in the government that are used in \nthese studies are flawed. An analysis based on the common pool resource problem \nrequires a size-weighted measure of partisan fragmentation to capture the extent to which \nparties have incentives to internalise costs (Franzese 2008). Only Volkerink and De Haan \n(2001) and Ricciuti (2004) use size-weighted measures, but not Perotti and Kontopoulos \n(2002) and Woo (2003). In addition, none of the studies reviewed here use measures of \npartisan fragmentation based on the portfolio shares of each party in the cabinet. One \nreason might be that these data are not routinely collected for a large number of countries \nand years. For instance, the World Bank\u2019s Database of Political Institutions (Beck et al. \n2001) includes several measures of partisan fragmentation, but they are based on seat \nshares in the legislature. Empirical studies of portfolio allocation have found a near-\nperfect correlation between seat shares and portfolio shares in coalition governments, \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n4 In addition, the relationship between the chief executive and the finance minister deserves more attention \nin future research. For instance, Jochimsen and Nuscheler (2009) find that the partisan alignment between \nthe prime minister and the finance minister in coalition governments affects deficits in the German L\u00e4nder. \n\t\r \u00a0 13 \nwhich Warwick and Druckman (2006: 635) describe as \u2018one of the strongest empirical \nrelationships documented in the social sciences\u2019. Yet, this finding is based almost entirely \non data for a few parliamentary democracies in Western Europe (see the review in \nVerzichelli 2008). We cannot simply assume that seat shares translate into portfolio \nshares in quite such mechanical ways elsewhere (Amorim Neto 2006; Cheibub 2007).5 \n \nIn addition, the model by Von Hagen and Harden (1995) shows that the fiscal effect of an \nincrease in the number of spending ministers depends upon the strategic power of the \nfinance minister in the budget process. Unfortunately, I have insufficient institutional \ndata on the balance of power between the finance minister and spending ministers to test \nthis prediction. Hallerberg, Strauch and Von Hagen (2007) carefully document several \ninstitutional features to assess the strategic authority of finance ministers, for example the \npower to impose ceilings on the budget bids of spending ministers, but only for 15 \nEuropean Union countries and part of the sample period used here. The data for Latin \nAmerican countries collected by Alesina, Hausmann, Hommes and Stein (1999) are not \ndetailed enough in this regard (see the critique by Hallerberg & Marier 2004: 578), while \nselected indicators in Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002: 220-221) are again limited to some \nindustrialised democracies. Ideally, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the \nrelationship between cabinet structure and fiscal policy outcomes would also cover the \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n5 A further potential problem with any measure of partisan fragmentation is that factions within parties may \nbe very powerful and in some cases functionally equivalent to separate parties (Thies 2001). Similarly, the \nrole of political parties in policy decisions is affected by the degree of discipline that their leaders can \nenforce (Hallerberg & Marier 2004; Hankla 2006). These possibilities deserve investigation elsewhere. \n\t\r \u00a0 14 \ninteraction between the number of spending ministers and the strategic power of the \nfinance minister. However, given the paucity of institutional data on executive budget \nprocesses, this aspect has to be tackled in future research. \n \nUsing a diverse sample of countries as well as theoretically grounded operationalisations \nof the variables of interest, the contribution of this paper is to test whether the number of \nspending ministers is associated with fiscal policy outcomes and whether this effect is \nincreasing in the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet. The original formulation of the \n\u2018law of 1\/n\u2019 suggests that we should expect effects on expenditure levels. However, an \nempirical test should not ignore tax expenditures, which are substantial in many countries \n(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 1984 and 1996).6 The \nextensive use of tax expenditures undermines the usefulness of public spending as an \nindicator of the size of government (Howard 1997). On the other hand, whether money is \nspent directly or through a \u2018tax loophole\u2019 on the revenue side does not affect the budget \nbalance. Hence, I consider impacts on both the budget deficit as well as expenditures and \ntest the following two sets of hypotheses: \n \nH1a: An increase in the number of spending ministers is associated with an increase in \nthe budget deficit. \n \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n6 A tax expenditure is \u2018a transfer of public resources that is achieved by reducing tax obligations with \nrespect to a benchmark tax, rather than by a direct expenditure\u2019 (Kraan 2004: 130). Tax expenditures can \ntake a number of forms, including exemptions, allowances, credits, rate relief and tax deferral. \n\t\r \u00a0 15 \nH1b: An increase in the number of spending ministers is associated with an increase in \npublic spending. \n \nH2a: The effect of an increase in the number of spending ministers on the budget deficit \nis increasing in the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet. \n \nH2b: The effect of an increase in the number of spending ministers on public spending is \nincreasing in the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet. \n \n \nA new dataset of spending ministers and partisan fragmentation \n \nThe analysis requires a theoretically grounded definition of the number of spending \nministers. Here, I code all ministers with full cabinet rank as spending ministers with the \nexceptions of the chief executive (prime minister, president or chancellor)7 and her \ndeputies, finance ministers (including budget ministers, ministers of the economy and the \ntreasury) and attached ministers, as well as any minister who is directly attached to the \nchief executive or who is subordinate to a portfolio for which a representative minister \nalready exists, such as associate ministers, assistant ministers, minister delegates, \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n7 In Switzerland\u2019s unique executive arrangement, the presidency rotates annually and confers no special \npowers over the other members of the cabinet. In this case only, I do not subtract the president and vice \npresident from my count of spending minsters, unless they also meet one of the remaining conditions for \nexclusion established in this definition. \n\t\r \u00a0 16 \nministers in other ministries and parliamentary secretaries. The latter group can also \ninclude ministers of state and secretaries of state, but these titles have to be carefully \ninterpreted, since their meaning is heterogeneous across countries.8 This \noperationalisation focuses on cabinet members who are most likely to externalise a large \nshare of the cost of their actions and disregards junior members who are unlikely to be as \nclosely involved in budgetary negotiations as the main minister in charge of a portfolio. \n \nBased on this definition, the project collected data on spending ministers in all 58 \ncountries in Persson and Tabellini\u2019s (2003) panel dataset, using the Europa World \nYearbook. Portfolios that are indicated as vacant in the source book are included in the \ndataset, assuming this state to be temporary. The number of spending ministers coded for \nany given year reflects the information on the composition of the cabinet reported in the \nYearbook for that particular year. Hence, I assume that the cabinets in place around the \nbeginning of the calendar year, when the Yearbook data were collected, affect fiscal \noutcomes for that year. Governments typically have a degree of flexibility during the \nexecution of the budget (Hallerberg et al. 2007; Beetsma et al. 2009), so this is a \nreasonable assumption (see also Tsebelis & Chang 2004: 457-458).9 \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n8 In France, Portugal and Japan, \u2018ministers of state\u2019 are full members of cabinet with equivalent or greater \nstatus than other independent cabinet ministers and are coded as spending ministers. Similarly, only where \nthe title \u2018secretary of state\u2019 indicates a full member of cabinet \u2013 as in the United States, the United \nKingdom, the Dominican Republic and Mexico \u2013 are they included in the count of spending ministers. \n9 Cabinets also exert influence during the formulation of the budget, prior to the start of the fiscal year. \nHowever, the design and duration of the budget formulation process varies across countries. To take into \naccount these differences would require very detailed data on the executive budget process, which are not \n\t\r \u00a0 17 \n \nI make no attempt to assign differential weights to portfolios, for several reasons. First, \nwhile it would be nice to capture variation in the degree to which spending ministers \ninternalise the cost of their actions, it is unclear how this might be achieved. Portfolio \nsalience scores (Druckman & Warwick 2005) do not capture such incentives. Nor do \nbudget shares. Fiscal illusion may affect different components of expenditure differently, \nas spending units vary greatly with regard to the structure of their budgets, not only the \noverall envelope (Dunleavy 1991). Second, political clout in cabinet negotiations depends \non personality factors that vary over time depending on the minister in charge, which \narguably is impossible to capture systematically. Finally, any weights would have to be \nrecalculated every time portfolios are reconfigured. This would be very data intensive, \ngiven the substantial amount of within-country variation in the number of spending \nministers (see below). For these reasons, and in line with the empirical literature \nreviewed above, I give equal weight to each spending minister. \n \nThe dataset of the number of spending ministers comprises 1358 observations over the \nperiod 1975 to 1998, excluding observations for years during which Freedom House \nclassified a country as \u2018not free\u2019.10 Figure 1 summarises the distribution of spending \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\navailable for most countries in this sample.

Here, Partyi \ndenotes the number of portfolios of governing party i as a share of the total number of \nportfolios held by all n parties in the cabinet (excluding deputy ministers and similar \njunior positions, but this time including the finance minister and chief executive). The \nequation can generate values between zero (single party cabinets) and close to one (when \nno party has more than a single cabinet portfolio). This measure is better at dealing with \noutliers at the upper end of the distribution than the \u2018effective number of parties\u2019 (Laakso \n& Taagepera 1979), which lacks an upper bound. To ensure consistency with the data on \nspending ministers, the main source is again the Europa World Yearbook, supplemented \nwhere necessary with data from Amorim Neto (2006) and national sources. \n \nRelated literature controls for annual GDP growth and inflation (Hallerberg & Marier \n2004) as well as trade openness (Alesina et al. 1999). In addition, I use a dummy for \nyears with executive elections to control for possible electoral budget cycles (Franzese \n2002; Brender & Drazen 2005). I also speculate that left parties in government might be \nmore profligate than administrations from the centre or the right of the political spectrum \nand control for a head of government from a left-of-centre party (for a more nuanced \nanalysis, see Cusack 1997). Freedom House scores account for the possibility that \n\t\r \u00a0 20 \ndemocracy affects the demand for public spending (Stasavage 2005). I also account for \nthe possible fiscal effect of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty with a dummy set equal to one for \nthe 12 original Eurozone members from that year onwards. Finally, I capture the fiscal \ncost of armed conflict with a dummy indicating years were countries participated in wars \naccording to Sarkees (2000).12 The appendix provides variable definitions and data \nsources, and Table 1 reports summary statistics. \n \nIn addition, a wide range of time invariant or rarely changing variables may also affect \nfiscal policy outcomes, including colonial heritage, population size, geographic location, \nthe form of government and the type of electoral system (Persson & Tabellini 2003). \nHere, as specified below, I use an empirical model with country fixed effects to capture \nthe direct impact of any time invariant variables and to \u2018soak up\u2019 most of the explanatory \npower of rarely changing variables (Beck 2001: 285). \n \n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \n \nEmpirical models and results \n \nTo test the hypotheses that an increase in spending ministers is associated with an \nincrease in deficits (H1a) and public spending (H1b), I use the following fixed effects \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n12 These data have casualty-based inclusion criteria, which are explained in detail in Sarkees (2000).

Also, the Fisher \ntest did not indicate that it is problematic to assume stationarity (Maddala & Wu 1999). \n\t\r \u00a0 22 \nFiscal outcomei,t = \u03b31(Spending ministersi,t) + \u03b32(Partisan fragmentationi,t) + \n\u03b33(Spending ministersi,t \u00d7 Partisan fragmentationi,t) + \n\u03b34(Fiscal outcomei,t-1) + \u03b35(Controlsi,t) + Countryi + Yeart + \u03b5i,t \n \nThe only difference compared with the first regression equation is the inclusion of the \ninteraction term. The second equation can be used to identify the marginal effect of \nspending ministers at a given level of partisan fragmentation in the cabinet: \n \n\u2202(Fiscal outcomei,t) \/ \u2202(Spending ministersi,t) = \u03b31 + \u03b33(Partisan fragmentationi,t) \n \nIn contrast to the coefficient \u03b21 in the first (additive) model, the coefficient \u03b31 in the \nsecond (multiplicative or interactive) model represents the effect of a one-unit increase in \nspending ministers when partisan fragmentation is zero, that is, under single party \ncabinets. In the presence of partisan fragmentation, both \u03b31 and \u03b33 are required to \ncalculate the effect of adding a spending minister (Brambor et al. 2006; Kam & Franzese \n2007). I expect partisan fragmentation to augment the effect of an increase in the number \nof spending ministers. This suggests a positive sign for \u03b33 so that (\u03b31 + \u03b33) > \u03b31. \n \n[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \nTable 2 reports the results. The columns are numbered in accordance with the relevant \nhypothesis. Columns (1a) and (1b) indicate that the number of spending ministers has a \nstrong direct impact on both deficits and public spending. The estimated effects of adding \n\t\r \u00a0 23 \none spending minister are to increase the deficit and public spending by 0.116 and 0.074 \nper cent of GDP, respectively.14 The effect on deficits is significant at the 1 per cent \nlevel, while the effect on expenditures is significant at the 5 per cent level. The direct \neffects of partisan fragmentation, on the other hand, are indistinguishable from zero. With \nregard to the control variables, only GDP growth and trade openness have statistically \nsignificant effects on both of these fiscal aggregates. A one-unit increase in GDP growth \nreduces deficits and expenditures by 0.058 and 0.070 per cent of GDP, respectively, and a \none-unit increase in trade openness reduces both deficits and outlays by 0.024 per cent of \nGDP (see also Busemeyer 2009). Executive elections are associated with a deterioration \nof the deficit by almost half a percentage point of GDP. Although the estimated effect on \nspending is positive, it is smaller and does not achieve significance at conventional \nlevels. This suggests that the adverse effect of electioneering on the deficit is partly due \nto measures on the revenue side. Finally, a worsening in the quality of democracy by one \nunit, as measured by Freedom House, reduces expenditures by 0.355 per cent of GDP. \nOverall, these are strong results in support of the hypothesised link between the number \nof spending ministers and fiscal performance. \n \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n14 It is not appropriate to compare the exact size of the coefficients on Spending ministers with those \ndocumented in most previous studies, due to the use of different fiscal indicators with varying levels of \nconsolidation, as well as different operationalisations of the variable of interest. The Volkerink and De \nHaan (2001) study is most similar in these regards, but very different in terms of the diversity of the \nsample. Their estimated effect on the deficit of adding a spending minister is somewhat smaller: 0.08 per \ncent of GDP in the baseline model (p. 229). \n\t\r \u00a0 24 \nI conducted several robustness checks. First, I added the number of lower house seats to \nmodels (1a) and (1b) to allow for the possibility that the common pool resource problem \nin the legislative arena contributes to fiscal performance. This did not substantively affect \nthe results and the coefficient on lower house seats was far from statistically significant in \nboth cases. As there is much less within-country variation in the number of seats in the \nlower house than in the number of spending ministers, this aspect could be explored \nfurther through cross-sectional analysis. Such an analysis should take into account \nbicameralism and the possibly distinct budgetary impact of second chambers (Heller \n1997, 2001; Bradbury & Crain 2001; Cusack & Fuchs 2003). Second, I checked whether \nthe effect of the number of spending ministers differs across forms of government, by \ninteracting this variable with a dummy for presidential systems (Persson & Tabellini \n2003). I also tested whether the effect differs according to level of development, using an \ninteraction with a dummy indicating OECD membership. In both cases, the interaction \nterms were far from statistically significant. In other words, I found no evidence that the \neffect of the number of spending ministers on deficits and expenditures differs \nsystematically between presidential and parliamentary regimes, or between the \nindustrialised democracies and other countries. I do not report these results here to \nconserve space, but they are available upon request. \n \nColumns (2a) and (2b) report results for the second set of hypotheses that the effect of the \nnumber of spending ministers on deficits and spending is increasing in the degree of \npartisan fragmentation of the cabinet. Since \u03b33 is positive, the estimates in columns (2a) \nand (2b) of Table 2 imply that the impact on the deficit and expenditures of adding a \n\t\r \u00a0 25 \nspending minister to the cabinet increases as the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet \nrises. In column (2a), the t-value for the interaction term is 0.87 (p = 0.388) and in \ncolumn (2b) it is 1.85 (p = 0.069). As a robustness check, I excluded extreme cases of \npartisan fragmentation, that is, those with a value of 0.9 or higher, which weakened these \nresults. Overall, these findings do lend some support to the interactive hypotheses, \nespecially with regard to expenditures, but the evidence is not very strong.  \n \n[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \nGraphic exposition helps further interpretation of the marginal effect of spending \nministers on fiscal policy outcomes as partisan fragmentation changes. Figure 2 plots the \nconditional coefficients and standard errors for the entire sample range of Partisan \nfragmentation. For both dependent variables, the conditional coefficient on Spending \nministers is positive across the sample range of, and increasing in, Partisan \nfragmentation. With the deficit as the dependent variable, the coefficient is statistically \nsignificant at the 10 per cent level for all values of the conditioning variable. With \nspending as the dependent variable, the coefficient falls short of significance at the 10 per \ncent level when a single party forms the cabinet, as the coefficient on Spending ministers \nin column (2b) of Table 2 indicates. However, the coefficient is significant for most non-\nzero values of Partisan fragmentation. In sum, the fiscal effect of increasing the number \nof spending ministers is somewhat less pronounced in single party cabinets or those with \n\t\r \u00a0 26 \nvery low levels of partisan fragmentation than in multi-party coalitions with high levels \nof partisan fragmentation.15 \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThis article has advanced the literature on fiscal performance in several ways. First, I give \nattention to the possible interaction between partisan fragmentation and the number of \nspending ministers. Second, I present evidence with a larger and more diverse sample \nthan any previous cross-national study of this topic. Finally, the operationalisations of the \nvariables of interest are carefully aligned with theoretical work, resulting in a new dataset \nof the number of spending ministers and partisan fragmentation. The empirical results \nimpressively confirm that the number of spending ministers affects fiscal performance. \nUsing an additive model, an extra spending minister is estimated to increase the deficit \nand expenditures of the central government by 0.116 and 0.074 per cent of GDP, \nrespectively. I also find some evidence that the marginal effect of spending ministers on \nexpenditures in particular is increasing in partisan fragmentation. The results suggest that \nsingle party cabinets may be able to mitigate, but not eliminate, fiscal illusion. \n \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n15 Of course, it is equally possible to compute the marginal effect of Partisan fragmentation as Spending \nministers changes, but the theoretical discussion does not require this. \n\t\r \u00a0 27 \nAn important question for further research is to explore exactly how parties may mitigate \nthe common pool resource problem in the cabinet. For instance, does it help if the finance \nminister has the same partisan affiliation as important spending ministers, such as those \nin charge of health or pensions? An answer to this question would require a more detailed \nlook at portfolio assignment in coalition governments. In-depth qualitative work may \noffer further clues. In terms of policy implications, my findings suggest that a reduction \nin the number of spending ministers is a promising strategy for fiscal consolidation, in \nparticular in countries with cabinets that are politically fragmented. However, to \nunderstand when this would be a feasible approach requires more work on the \ndeterminants of the number of spending ministers. A cursory glance at Figure 1 suggests \npossible determinants of cross-country variation, such as country size, but the causes of \nthe variation within countries are less obvious. Future research should also extend the \ncoverage of this database of spending ministers and partisan fragmentation in the cabinet. \nThese variables should be routinely included in empirical work on fiscal performance. \n\t\r \u00a0 28 \nReferences \nAlesina, A. & Drazen, A.
