This has enabled\nteaching to take place in a computer laboratory, using real data, and encouraging an\nexploratory and research-oriented approach. This paper briefly describes a hypertext\nComputer Based Tutorial (CBT) concerned with descriptive statistics and introductory data\nanalysis. The CBT has three primary objectives: the introduction of concepts, the facilitation\nof revision, and the acquisition of skills for project work. Objective testing is incorporated\nand used for both self-assessment and formal examination. Evaluation was carried out with a\nlarge group of Health Science students, heterogeneous with regard to their IT skills and\nbasic numeracy. The results of the evaluation contain valuable lessons.\nRationale\nTraditionally, the teaching of introductory statistics to Health Sciences students has been\nbased on a series of lectures in conjunction with practical classes using an electronic calcu-\nlator. The use of a statistical package such as BMDP or GLIM has usually been restricted\nto advanced classes encountering more sophisticated techniques. However, the increasing\navailability of user-friendly packages designed for teaching, such as Minitab, has meant\nthat it has become possible to introduce elementary classes to a statistical package at an\nearly stage (Stephenson, 1990). In turn, this provides the opportunity for analysis of real\ndata right from the outset of the student's statistical learning, giving experience of prob-\nlems as they arise in practice (Singer and Willett, 1990). The use of computers in nursing\neducation is considered to be particularly important as a means of preparing nurses for an\nincreasingly computerized workplace (Yucha and Reigeluth, 1983).\nA teaching and learning approach which combines the use of statistical software with\ncomputer-based tutorials provides flexibility with respect to tailoring information to the\nspecific needs of individual types of users, and allows the incorporation of user-\n68\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\ninteraction (Richards et alt 1991; Barker and Manji, 1991; Bishop et al, 1992). The\nComputer Based Tutorial (CBT) we have developed at the University of Ulster is\nconcerned with descriptive statistics and introductory data analysis using Minitab, and is\npart of a suite of CBTs developed under the funding of the Enterprise in Higher\nEducation (EHE) Initiative. The tutorial is targeted specifically at health sciences\nstudents, and uses data sets relevant to their subject of study as examples. The tutorials\nare structured so that they can be used for directed learning and assessment to introduce\nconcepts, and student-centred learning to facilitate revision and the acquisition of skills\nfor project work.\nObjective testing is also incorporated into the tutorial which may be used for either self-\nassessment or formal examination.\nContent\nThe CBT introduces the basic ideas and applications of descriptive statistics, with\nreference to Minitab in applying statistical techniques. It aims to provide the student with\nan intuitive understanding of statistical concepts, and a variety of relevant examples are\nused to illustrate the techniques. The tutorial is designed to develop the student's ability\nto organize, present and interpret data in a number of ways such as tables, graphs and\nsummaries. In addition, it aims to introduce the student to the concept of statistical\ninference, and enable him or her to carry out and interpret simple hypothesis tests.\nVarious screens within the tutorial include output from Minitab, with an Explanation\nbutton, or a short note which may be expanded to give additional information. An\nexample is presented in Figure 1, illustrating the Minitab command DESC which is used\nhere to produce summary statistics for the pulse rates of respondents who did not run\nbefore their pulse was measured. The Explanation button provides information on how to\ncalculate the median and semi-interquartile range.\nFor the non-runners\nMTB>descC17\nproduces:\nN MEAN\nC17 57 0.105\nMIN MAX\nC17 -14.000 10.000\nMEDIAN\n0.000\nQ1\n-2.000\nTRMEAN\n-0.137\n03\n2.000\njggicirifiii\nSTDEV\n4.1 El\nSEMEAN\n0.551\nflSJiSWtlOHiij\nFigure LA typical screen\n69\nNuala Colgan, Sally McClean and Bryan Scotney Computer-based teaching\nOn completion of a section, the student may undertake to answer a series of questions for\nself-assessment. These may require a textual answer, or a choice of one or more\nappropriate answers from a selection provided.\nDelivery\nThe tutorial has been developed using version 3.1 of the authoring system Guide running\nunder Windows and under the management of a Novell network which allows the\nnetwork manager to collect individual student answers from the respective work-stations,\nand to present them in a file for marking by the class instructor.\nIn our trials, the students were introduced by the lecturer to the system prior to starting to\nuse the CBT, initially in a lecture theatre, and subsequently in a computer laboratory.\nEach topic was introduced verbally to the students, as a group, before they began to use\nthe appropriate section of the tutorial. In order to facilitate independent learning, the\nCBT was accompanied by a printed booklet which explained the essential features of the\nsystem. The students were allowed to work through the tutorial during class, and in their\nown time, and both individual and group use of the system was encouraged.\nThe use of the CBT was piloted with a group of 70 nursing students as part of an\nintroductory course on research methods. These students were judged to be particularly\nappropriate for introduction to the subject via a CBT as they provided a means of\nallowing a large heterogeneous group with regard to IT skills and basic numeracy an\nopportunity to familiarize themselves with the material at their own pace. Previous\ncohorts had expressed dissatisfaction with the course as they found the class size too large\nand the topic difficult to master, and expressed a lack of conviction that either statistics or\ncomputing was needed for nurse training. It was hoped that the CBT could help to\novercome some of these problems. Prior to the introduction of the tutorial, students were\ntaught using a combination of formal classes and computer-laboratory sessions.\nAlthough it was deemed essential for future project-work that they learned to use the\ncomputer for statistical analysis, the laboratory classes often proved problematic as a few\nstudents with learning difficulties tended to monopolize the lecturer's time at the expense\nof the more able students. Under the new system, students used the software as part of a\nseries of one-hour classes held in two inter-connected 30-workstation networked\nlaboratories. During class, the lecturer, assisted by a demonstrator, was present to answer\nquestions and trouble-shoot. Students were allowed to access the software outside formal\nteaching times.\nEvaluation\nAt the end of the course, the students were evaluated by means of a confidential\nquestionnaire in order to ascertain how useful they had found computer-based learning,\nand their views on the system. The questionnaire is presented in Appendix 1. It was\ncompleted by the 70 students of whom 67% had managed to complete all four sections of\nthe tutorial, while 17% had completed three out of four during class. 11% had completed\ntwo sections, and 5% had completed only one. In all, nearly three quarters of the group\nmanaged to complete them during the class, so the volume of material was about right for\nthe amount of time allocated during timetabled contact. Of those students who completed\nall four sections of the tutorial, 74% often or always completed them during the\n70\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\ntimetabled classes. Overall, 73% never attempted the tutorial outside class. This aspect of\nstudents' use of the CBT may be partly accounted for by the fact that 23% of the class\nwere part-time students for whom on-campus time was severely limited, but it is still\nrather disappointing.\nIn all, 67% of students found the CBT helpful and 33% found them unhelpful. There was\nno association between success at completing the tutorials and whether a student found\nthem helpful, with 65% of students who failed to complete all four sections finding them\nhelpful, as opposed to 67% of those who completed all four Of2 = 0.038 with 1 degree of\nfreedom). All (27%) students who attempted the tutorial outside the timetabled classes\nreported that they found it more useful outside than during class.\nOverall, the response as to how useful the students found the tutorial was again\ndisappointing. 64% said that they did not feel discouraged if they scored poorly on the\nend-of-section self-assessment tests, and 37% said that they found the tutorial beneficial\nfor reinforcing understanding, 11% for increasing confidence, 54% for providing\nexplanations, 20% for providing a change from Minitab, 39% for reviewing material, 50%\nfor testing understanding. On the other hand, only 3% said that they found the tutorial\nbeneficial for providing understanding. Furthermore, 33% reported that they did not\nenjoy the tutorial, as opposed to 47% who did not mind it. Only 20% reported that they\npositively enjoyed it, and only 31% thought they would use computer-based instruction\nagain if given the opportunity, while 44% would not use it. The remaining 25% were\nunsure.\n32% preferred to work alone while 68% preferred to share a computer and discuss the\nanswers with someone else. The multiple-choice questions were found useful by 68%, but\nonly 22% regarded the instructional level to be appropriate to their needs. 55% of\nstudents did not find the instructional booklet useful, with no association between this\ncomment and whether they had worked alone or together (x2 = 6.45 with 3 degrees of\nfreedom) or whether they had used the tutorial outside the timetabled classes (g2 = 0.053\nwith 1 degree of freedom). However, a majority (55%) thought that the tutorials were a\nuseful revision aid, with a further 33% unsure, and only 12% who did not think they were\nuseful for revision.\nThe evaluation questionnaire offered the students the opportunity to raise any additional\nissues; ones which were frequently mentioned, and which are discussed in the next section,\nwere that the classes were too large, that they were inadequately experienced in using\ncomputers, that they preferred ordinary lectures, and that they would like a more\ncomprehensive induction programme prior to using the CBT and Minitab software.\nDiscussion\nIn terms of completing the CBT, the students successfully used the tutorial, with two\nthirds of them completing all four sections and three quarters of them completing it\nwithin timetabled classes, and it is encouraging to note that many students found it\nhelpful, particularly as a means of increasing understanding and as a revision aid. What is\nmore, two thirds of the students found the tutorial helpful, or did not mind it. However,\nthe figure of 44% of students who stated that, if given the chance, they would not use\ncomputer-based learning again has provoked us seriously to examine the shortcomings in\nboth the delivery of the tutorial and the way it is embedded in the course.\n71\nNuala Colgan, Sally McClean and Bryan Scotney Computer-based teaching\nSome of the negative comments are concerned with problems of the course rather than the\ndelivery mechanism. For example, students expressed a dissatisfaction with large class\nsizes, which meant that individual assistance was limited. The most frequently voiced\nconcern, however, was that students felt that much more initial explanation was required\nfrom the lecturer of both the structure of the tutorial and its statistical content. Some\nstudents expressed a preference for a short verbal introduction at the beginning of each\nlaboratory session; others felt that the whole of the first few classes should follow a\ntraditional lecture\/discussion format to establish the teaching and learning of the statistical\ncontent, and only then should work be predominantly laboratory based. Despite the fact\nthat the use of Minitab and the CBT requires very little knowledge about the machine or\nits operating system, many students actually saw the use of computers as a 'complication'\nwith which they felt unable to cope until they had mastered the statistical material by more\ntraditional means. This was certainly at variance with our desire to enable students taught\nin a computer laboratory to have immediate hands-on experience of the methods being\ntaught, and also with our hope that thus liberated from the drudgery of calculators, they\nmight focus their attention on the statistical methods under consideration.\nWe had anticipated that the teaching method would enable the students, from the outset,\nto adopt a more exploratory and research-oriented approach with a focus on method-\nselection rather than calculation. But many students felt that their own limited knowledge\nof computers was an obstacle to adopting such an approach. While some students felt\nthat by being encouraged to develop a more critical approach to the use of statistics they\nwould be better equipped to cope with project work, they felt that the tutorial would be of\ngreater benefit at a later stage in the course in relation to clinical practice. A small number\nof students still expressed a lack of understanding as to why they needed to use the\ncomputer at all.\nThe clear lessons in all this are that in future years we shall focus more on motivating\nstudents at the beginning of the course, and on providinga more structured introduction\nto the use of the computer and the use of computer-based learning. This may in part be\nachieved by accepting the need for the students to undertake the learning of basic\nstatistical concepts by more traditional means prior to their exposure to computer-based\napproaches. Together with a reorganization of delivery which would permit greater access\nto the CBT outside of timetabled classes, the students would thus 'gain control of their\nlearning' (Isaacs, 1990). In any case, the entire approach must be underpinned by a\ncommitment to the relevance of computer-based statistics to both health science research\nand clinical practice.\nReferences\nBarker, P. and Manji, K.
