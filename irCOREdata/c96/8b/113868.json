Introduction\nIt has been observed in two\u2013dimensional, high Reynolds number flows that axisym-\nmetric, coherent vortical structures arise spontaneously from random initial conditions\n(McWilliams 1984; Fornberg 1977). Many studies of these coherent structures focus on\nthe behaviour of an axisymmetric vortex under a non\u2013axisymmetric perturbation, which\ncould be weak or strong. These studies typically consider perturbations with an azimuthal\nwavenumber m = 2 or higher. (For discussion of the m = 1 case and its peculiarities see\nLlewellyn Smith 1995.) Early studies of such vortices showed that they often return to\nan axisymmetric state. A vortex can relax inviscidly to an axisymmetric state when the\nnon\u2013axisymmetric perturbation becomes finely scaled due to the spiral wind\u2013up in the\nunderlying flow (Melander et al. 1987). As the values of the perturbation vorticity do\nnot tend to zero pointwise, a more convenient notion of axisymmetrization is when the\nnon\u2013axisymmetric components of the stream function \u03c8 tend to zero for large times. For\nlarge but finite Reynolds number R, the non\u2013axisymmetric components of the vorticity\nare destroyed, and hence the vortex axisymmetrizes, on the time scale O(R1\/3), which is\nfast compared to the slow viscous timescale of O(R) (Bernoff & Lingevitch 1994; Bajer\net al. 2001).\nAs more numerical and experimental studies were carried out, it became apparent\nthat axisymmetrization only occurs for sufficiently weak perturbation amplitudes, and\n2 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nthat for larger amplitudes the vortex can evolve into a persistent non\u2013axisymmetric\nstate (Dritschel 1989, 1998; Koumoutsakos 1997; Rossi et al. 1997). An example of a\npersistent nonlinear state is a multipole, which can be formed by allowing an initial\nvorticity distribution of the form\nZ(r, \u03b8) = Z0(r) + \u03b4Zm(r)eim\u03b8 + complex conjugate, (1.1)\nto evolve freely in time. The variables (r, \u03b8) are the usual polar coordinates and Zm(r)eim\u03b8\nis an m\u2013fold perturbation to the axisymmetric monopole vortex Z0(r). The real param-\neter \u03b4 > 0 is an amplitude and axisymmetrization occurs if \u03b4 is below a threshold value.\nIn the most studied case the vorticity distributions take the form\nZ0(r) =\n1\n4pi\ne\u2212r\n2\/4, Z2(r) =\nr2\n4pi\ne\u2212r\n2\/4, (1.2)\nwith m = 2. The vortex evolves into a tripole which consists of a vortex core with two\nopposite\u2013signed satellites of vorticity rotating around it, if \u03b4 is above some threshold\nvalue (Rossi et al. 1997; Barba 2006; Barba & Leonard 2007). This tripole structure can\nbe seen in the top row of panels in figure 1, which show the evolution of (1.1) and (1.2)\nwith R = 104 and \u03b4 = 0.5 at t = 0, t = 300 and t = 700. Negative vorticity is coloured\nblack in the panels, and at t = 700 we can see the two negative satellites rotating around\na positive vortex core.\nSuch tripoles can also emerge from instabilities within axisymmetric shielded monopoles,\nthat is comprising a vortex core with a ring of opposite\u2013signed vorticity encasing it and\nzero total circulation. This has led to many investigations of the evolution of a tripole\nfrom these shielded monopoles by experiments (Van Heijst et al. 1991) and numerical\nstudies (Carton & Legras 1994; Morel & Carton 1994). The physical observation of these\nstructures is not restricted to the laboratory however, as these tripoles have been observed\nin the ocean, first by Pingree & Le Cann (1992).\nThere remain a number of unresolved issues involving such multipolar vortices. For\nwhat choices of Z0(r) and Zm(r) do such structures form? How, if at all, are these\nmultipoles (which have both signs of vorticity present) related to persistent cat\u2019s eye\nstructures in which the vorticity in the satellites is the same sign as the core? The\nthreshold parameter \u03b4 shows a dependence on the Reynolds number: does \u03b4(R) have\na limiting value in the inviscid limit as R \u2192 \u221e? Barba & Leonard (2007) have run\nsimulations showing that the threshold value \u03b4(R) decreases as R is increased, but the\nlarge Reynolds number limit has not been extensively researched.\nThe aim of this paper is to address some of these issues using a combination of numer-\nical simulations and an asymptotic limit in which we consider vortices with sharp edges.\nTo set the scene, we note that the phenomenon of tripole formation is not restricted to\nGaussian vortices: consider, for example the \u2018tanh\u2019 profiles\nZ0(r) =\n1\n4pi\n1\u2212 tanh ((r2 \u2212 \u03c32)\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c3)))\n1 + tanh (\u03c32\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c3))) , (1.3)\nZ2(r) =\nr2\n4pi\n1\u2212 tanh ((r2 \u2212 \u03c322)\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c32)))\n1 + tanh (\u03c322\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c32)))\n, (1.4)\n(Hall et al. 2003a). As \u03c3 and \u03c32 are varied from 0 to 1, the axisymmetric vortex and\nthe perturbation change from a broad Gaussian\u2013like form to a sharp Rankine (top\u2013hat)\nvortex. The bottom row of panels in figure 1 shows the evolution of these tanh profiles\ninto a tripole for the parameter values \u03c3 = \u03c32 = 0.2, R = 104 and \u03b4 = 0.5. In this case\nthe negative satellites are clearly visible in each panel as the black regions outside the\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 3\ny\n\u22126\n6\nt=0 t=300 t=700\nx x x\n\u22126\ny\n6\n\u22126 \u221266 6 \u22126 6\nFigure 1.

Note that while such sharp edged vortices are convenient mathematically,\nthey also arise very naturally in geophysical systems and two\u2013dimensional turbulence via\nprocesses such as vortex stripping (Legras & Dritschel 1993).\nUsing these tanh profiles in the limit as \u03c3 \u2192 1 we are able to calculate an inviscid\nthreshold for the formation of satellite vortices using the theory of Balmforth et al. (2001),\nhenceforth referred to as BLSY. As mentioned above, another type of non\u2013axisymmetric\nstructure that can form is a ring of cat\u2019s eyes around a vortex core, which has vorticity\neverywhere of one sign: here the fluid circulates about each cat\u2019s eye (in a frame co\u2013\nrotating with the ring) and the vorticity is locally flattened. To be clear about our\nterminology, we will use the term cat\u2019s eyes to refer cases where the vorticity is everywhere\nof one sign, multipoles for both signs, and satellites to refer to either. These cat\u2019s eyes may\nbe generated for m = 2 by exposing an axisymmetric vortex to an irrotational external\nstrain field that is switched off after some given time. For a sufficiently weak strain the\nvortex returns to an axisymmetric state, and the non\u2013axisymmetric perturbations are\nwound up into spiral filaments (Briggs et al. 1970; Bassom & Gilbert 1998; Le Dize`s\n2000). If the amplitude of the strain is above some threshold amplitude however, the\nvorticity can locally homogenize to form a pair of cat\u2019s eyes rotating around the coherent\nvortex core (Schecter et al. 2000; Balmforth et al. 2001; Macaskill et al. 2002; Turner\n& Gilbert 2007). Thus for m = 2, cat\u2019s eyes appear similar to the satellites in a tripole\nvortex, except they are of the same sign as the core.\nThresholds for cat\u2019s eye formation in a Gaussian vortex have been obtained numerically\nby Turner & Gilbert (2007) and by BLSY in their asymptotic model, with qualitative\nagreement. In this paper our aim is to study the threshold for the formation of satellite\nstructures for sharp\u2013edged vortices using the asymptotic model of BLSY in the absence\nof an external forcing but with an initial condition equivalent to that in (1.1) used for\nthe formation of multipolar vortices. This model begins with a smooth monopole vortex\n4 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nwith the profile\nZ0(r) = ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r), (1.5)\nwhich consists of a compact vortex ZC(r), that is where the vorticity is identically zero\nbeyond some radius, plus an asymptotically small \u2018skirt\u2019 \u000fZS(r). The small parameter\nthat is exploited is \u000f. The simplest example of a compact vortex is a Rankine vortex,\nwhere\nZC(r) =\n{\n1, (r < 1),\n0, (r > 1). (1.6)\nThis vortex supports an m = 2 Kelvin mode with a critical layer at r2 =\n\u221a\n2 where the\nangular velocity of the mode equals that of the fluid. When a weak skirt is introduced\nthis wave interacts with vorticity in the critical layer of width \u000f and the normal mode\nis replaced by a quasi\u2013mode (Briggs et al. 1970; Schecter et al. 2000; Turner & Gilbert\n2007). A quasi\u2013mode is essentially a special transient solution of the linear initial\u2013value\nproblem where the stream function decays exponentially and the vorticity wraps up into\nspiral filaments without decay.\nThe BLSY model yields a coupled system comprising an ODE for the normal mode\namplitude and a PDE for the vorticity in the critical layer, and these authors study this\nsystem when the vortex is subjected to an external strain field. For weak strain there\nis the linear quasi\u2013mode and exponential decay, but for stronger perturbations, above a\nthreshold, persistent cat\u2019s eyes form, as vorticity is homogenized in recirculating regions\nin the critical layer. We also note in passing that rather than the BLSY approach of\nsolving the initial value problem, another study (Le Dize`s 2000) seeks steady states with\nasymptotically thin cat\u2019s eyes, using a jump condition across the critical layer.\nWe adapt the asymptotic theory of BLSY to incorporate a non\u2013zero initial mode m\ncondition, such as the examples (1.1) to (1.4). This only involves two complex parameters,\nthe initial amplitude of the normal mode and the initial strength of the mode m vorticity\nin the critical layer, and these reduce to three real parameters after rotation. Thus the\nquestion of the formation of satellite vortices, within the limit of sharp\u2013edged vortices (or\nsimilar ones fitting the BLSY framework) amounts to obtaining a threshold in a three\u2013\ndimensional parameter space, when the initial condition is allowed to evolve freely in time.\nAlthough we will be able to calculate a threshold for the formation of satellites, we will\nnot be able to determine the sign of the vorticity in the satellites because the governing\nequations for the vorticity are identical to those where the vorticity has an arbitrary\nconstant added to it. Focusing on the m = 2 case, we study three methods of computing\na threshold contour. The first two are only qualitative: an inflection point diagnostic\ncalculates when the azimuthally averaged profile first develops an inflection point at the\ncritical radius, and a neutral mode diagnostic calculates when this azimuthal averaged\nprofile supports a neutral mode. We then simulate the BLSY system to obtain the true\nasymptotic threshold using a \u2018first bounce\u2019 criterion for when the vorticity perturbations\nfeed back onto the basic profile strongly enough to produce satellites. We discuss the\nusefulness of the qualitative diagnostics and confirm the results by full Navier\u2013Stokes\nsimulations of profiles of the form (1.3) and (1.4).\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we give the BLSY governing equations and\ndiscuss initial conditions. In \u00a73 we take a weakly nonlinear version of the BLSY equations\nand use this to calculate both the inflection point and the neutral mode thresholds.\nSimulations of the BLSY system give the correct asymptotic threshold and are detailed\nin \u00a74 while comparison with full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations is given in \u00a75. Some concluding\nremarks are set out in \u00a76.\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 5\n2. Formulation\nIn this section we give the equations from the asymptotic theory of BLSY. We use their\nnotation and we direct the reader to this paper for derivations, in particular rescalings,\nand discussion (though a few results we need are to be found in appendix B). The theory\nbegins with a profile of the form (1.5) which supports a normal mode with complex\namplitude \u03d5\u02c6(t). This interacts with the total vorticity \u03b6T = \u03b2y + \u03b6(y, \u03b8, t) in a thin\ncritical layer, where y is a rescaled, inward pointing radial coordinate with the critical\nlayer at y = 0. The parameter \u03b2 = \u00b11 specifies the background gradient; our interest is\nonly in the case \u03b2 = 1 so that the background profile is increasing with y, so decreasing\nwith radius r, and the vortex is stable. The equations are, with m = 2 from now on:\n\u2202t\u03b6 + y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6 + (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6)\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 = 0, (2.1)\ni\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u03c7(t) + \u3008e\u22122i\u03b8\u03b6\u3009, (2.2)\n\u03d5(\u03b8, t) = \u03d5\u02c6(t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.3)\n\u3008f\u3009 = PV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy\n\u222e\nf(y, \u03b8, t)\n2pi\nd\u03b8. (2.4)\nThe normal mode of amplitude \u03d5\u02c6(t), riding on the compact vortex, drives a flow with\nstream function \u03d5(\u03b8, t) defined by (2.3) in the critical layer, and (2.1) gives advection of\nvorticity in this and the background shear from the compact vortex. Equation (2.2) then\ngives the feedback on the normal mode with a principal value integral defined by (2.4).\nWe set the external forcing, that is strain, \u03c7(t) to zero, but instead are interested in\nadding an initial mode 2 disturbance, as in (1.1)\u2013(1.4). In limits for which the BLSY\ntheory applies, any initial disturbance of this form amounts to specifying the initial\ncomplex amplitude \u2206 of the normal mode, and the initial complex value of the mode\n2 vorticity in the critical layer, given by another complex constant \u0393. We thus use the\ninitial condition\n\u03b6(y, \u03b8, t = 0) = \u03930 + \u0393e2i\u03b8 + c.c., \u03d5\u02c6(t = 0) = \u2206. (2.5)\nHere the additive constant \u03930, the mean vorticity in the critical layer, does not affect the\nBLSY analysis as it does not enter into any of (2.1\u20132.4); hence we set \u03930 = 0 throughout\nthe analysis. However the value of this parameter in the full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nultimately determines if the satellites formed are positive (cat\u2019s eyes) or negative (a\ntripole). Since after rotation we can take one of \u0393 or \u2206 to be purely real, we are left with\na three\u2013dimensional parameter space, and the question: for which points in this space\ndo persistent structures form in the critical layer? By solving (2.1\u20132.5) in both weakly\nnonlinear and fully nonlinear settings we will calculate the inflection point, neutral mode\nand first bounce thresholds, above which the nonlinear satellites induced on the vortex\npersist and below which the vortex returns to an axisymmetric state. These thresholds\nwill be of the form\nF (\u0393,\u2206) = 0, (2.6)\nwhich gives a surface in parameter space. The results we will obtain are universal in that\nthey apply to any vortex for which the BLSY model is valid.\nHowever to compare with full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations, we shall focus on the family\nof profiles in (1.3), which tend to the Rankine vortex (1.6) as \u03c3 \u2192 1. In this case the\nm = 2 critical layer occurs at r2 =\n\u221a\n2 and so the small parameter \u000f for the asymptotic\nexpansions is proportional to Z \u20320(r2), tending to zero as \u03c3 \u2192 1. In this case the constants\n6 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\n\u0393 and \u2206 are related to the parameters \u03b4 and \u03c32 from (1.4) via\n\u0393 =\n\u03b4Z2(r2)\npiZ \u20320(r2)2\n, \u2206 =\n8\u03b4P2\npiZ \u20320(r2)2\n, (2.7)\nwhere P2 is a projection on the normal mode, given by\nP2 = \u221218\n(\u222b 1\n0\ns3Z2(s) ds+ PV\n\u222b \u221e\n1\nsZ2(s)\n2\u2212 s2 ds\n)\n. (2.8)\nThese rescalings and this projection formula are explained, in a general setting, in ap-\npendix B.\nBecause of the principal value integral in (2.4), the early evolution of this system with\nthe given initial condition has a singular forcing of the normal mode (cf. BLSY section\n5.1). To cleanly handle this behaviour we integrate over the short time interval from\nt = 0 to a time t\u2217 satisfying 1 \u001d t\u2217 \u001d 1\/L, where L is some large cut\u2013off value of the\nprincipal value integral. We refer to this latter time t\u2217 as t = 0+ for brevity. For very\nshort times the (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6)\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 term in (2.1) is much smaller than the other two terms,\nand so we have\n\u03b6(y, \u03b8, t) ' \u0393e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.9)\nand then\ni\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008\u03b6e\u22122i\u03b8\u3009 ' \u0393 sin(2Lt)\nt\n. (2.10)\nTherefore on the short time scale of t = O(L\u22121) a large forcing of the quantity \u03d5\u02c6 takes\nplace. Using \u222b \u221e\n0\nsin(u)\nu\ndu =\npi\n2\n, (2.11)\nwe find that at time t = 0+, \u03d5\u02c6(0+) = \u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\/2.\nWe rewrite the initial value problem (for numerical and analytical reasons), now start-\ning at time t = 0+ by writing\n\u03b6 \u2032 = \u03b6 \u2212 (\u0393e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + c.c.), (2.12)\nto obtain the system of equations\n\u2202t\u03b6 + y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6 \u2032 + (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 2it\u0393e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + 2it\u0393\u2217e2iyt\u22122i\u03b8)\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 = 0, (2.13)\ni\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008e\u22122i\u03b8\u03b6 \u2032\u3009, \u03d5 = \u03d5\u02c6(t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.14)\n(where the star denotes the complex conjugate) with the new initial conditions\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, 0+) = 0, \u03d5\u02c6(0+) = \u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\/2. (2.15)\nIn the next section we derive the weakly nonlinear diagnostics we use for calculating our\nthreshold criteria.\n3. Weakly nonlinear results\nIn this section we consider a weakly nonlinear solution to (2.13\u20132.15) and derive the\ninflection point and the neutral mode diagnostics for determining when satellites persist\nin a vortex or when the vortex returns to an axisymmetric state.\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 7\n3.1. Weakly nonlinear critical\u2013layer equations\nWe seek an approximate solution to (2.13\u20132.15) by introducing\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, t) = \u03b6\u02c6 \u2032(y, t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c.+ \u03b6\u00af(y, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.1)\nThis expansion neglects all the higher order effects; however it does allow us to calculate\nthe two qualitative criteria described above which have been used in the study of BLSY.\nSubstituting (3.1) into (2.13) we obtain the set of equations\n\u2202t\u03b6\u02c6\n\u2032 + 2iy\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 + 2i\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6 = 0, (3.2)\n\u2202t\u03b6\u00af \u2212 2i(\u2202y \u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 \u2212 2it\u0393e\u22122iyt)\u03d5\u02c6\u2217 + c.c. = 0, (3.3)\ni\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032\u3009. (3.4)\nThe initial conditions for this problem are\n\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032(y, 0+) = 0, \u03b6\u00af(y, 0+) = 0, and \u03d5\u02c6(0+) = \u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\/2. (3.5)\nThe quantity \u03b6\u00af is the correction to the azimuthal mean of the vorticity in the critical\nlayer and we seek the large\u2013time form of this function to see how the initial condition\neventually alters the vorticity profile in the skirt. From this modification we can form\ndiagnostics to test whether satellites persist or not. These are only qualitative as the\nweakly nonlinear development does not apply quantitatively at finite values, that is not\nat the threshold.\nWe solve (3.2) by the same method as in \u00a75.1 of BLSY, and using the initial conditions\n(3.5) gives\n\u03d5\u02c6 =\n(\n\u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\n2\n)\ne\u2212pi\u03b2t, (3.6)\n\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 = 2i\u03b2\n(\u03b2pi + 2iy)\n\u03b22pi2 + 4y2\n(\ne\u2212pi\u03b2t \u2212 e\u22122iyt)(\u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\n2\n)\n. (3.7)\nThus the large time form of the solution for \u03b6\u00af in (3.3) can be expressed as\n\u03b6\u00af\u221e \u2261 \u03b6\u00af(y, t\u2192\u221e) = \u221232\u03b2y |A|\n2 + pi(Ai\u0393r \u2212Ar\u0393i)\n(\u03b22pi2 + 4y2)2\n+ 8(\u03b22pi2 \u2212 4y2) Ar\u0393r +Ai\u0393i\n(\u03b22pi2 + 4y2)2\n,\n(3.8)\nwhere A = \u2206 \u2212 ipi\u0393\/2 and the subscripts r and i denote real and imaginary parts\nrespectively. As mentioned earlier, we can rotate our axes to make one of the quantities\n\u0393 or \u2206 real; thus without loss of generality we set \u0393r = \u0393 and \u0393i = 0.\n3.2. Inflection point diagnostic\nHere we consider an inflection point diagnostic used by BLSY: we consider the contour\nin parameter space where the azimuthally averaged total vorticity in the critical layer\n\u03b6T = \u03b2y + \u03b6\u00af\u221e first develops an extremal point at the critical radius (y = 0). Using this\ndiagnostic with \u03b6\u00af\u221e given by (3.8) and with \u0393 real gives the expression\nF (\u0393,\u2206) = \u22062r + \u2206\n2\ni \u2212\npi2\n4\n\u03932 \u2212 pi\n4\n32\n= 0. (3.9)\nEquation (3.9) gives a three\u2013dimensional surface in the parameter space (\u0393,\u2206r,\u2206i) out-\nside which satellites persist and within which the vortex returns to axisymmetry (i.e. the\nstream function \u03d5\u02c6(t) decays to zero).\nFor the case when \u2206 is also real, which corresponds to an initial condition of the form\n8 M.

Threshold contours, for the case when \u0393 and \u2206 are real, inside which satellites do\nnot persist and outside which they do. Contour 1 is given by the inflection point diagnostic\n(3.10), contour 2 by the neutral mode diagnostic (3.16) and contour 3 by the numerical solution\nof (2.13\u20132.15). Contour 3 defines the set of parameters for which the first bounce time t = 45.\nThe stars represent parameter values used in the numerical simulations in \u00a74.\nused by the Navier\u2013Stokes simulations of Rossi et al. (1997) and Barba & Leonard (2007),\nwe have a contour in the (\u0393,\u2206) plane given by\nF (\u0393,\u2206) = \u22062 \u2212 pi\n2\n4\n\u03932 \u2212 pi\n4\n32\n= 0, (3.10)\nwhich describes two hyperbolae centred on the point \u2206 = \u0393 = 0. For any parameter\nvalues lying between these hyperbolae the vortex would be assumed to return to an\naxisymmetric state and not contain persistent satellites. This contour can be seen as\ncontour 1 in figure 2.\nThis inflection point threshold is very simplistic so we do not expect it to agree well\nwith nonlinear simulations. This is because the existence of an extremal point does not\nguarantee satellite persistence, as was observed by BLSY for the generation of cat\u2019s\neyes. Mo\u00a8ller & Montgomery (1999) have also used this method in the context of the full\nequations of motion and reached similar conclusions to the limitations of this diagnostic.\nA more informative diagnostic is to calculate when the vortex has an axisymmetric basic\nprofile that will maintain a neutral mode, i.e., one where \u03d5\u02c6(t) = constant. Neutral modes\nof an axisymmetric vortex have been seen to correspond to persistent cat\u2019s eye structures\n(Turner et al. 2008).\n3.3. Neutral mode diagnostic\nTo calculate neutral modes of the axisymmetric total vorticity profile in the critical layer\n\u03b6T = \u03b2y + \u03b6\u00af\u221e, we perform a normal mode analysis. This analysis is the same as that\nin Hall et al. (2003a) and similar to that in BLSY. From (2.1) and (2.2) we solve the\nlinearised system\n\u2202t\u03b6\u02c6 + imy\u03b6\u02c6 + im(\u03b2 + \u2202y \u03b6\u00af\u221e)\u03d5\u02c6 = 0, i\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = PV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b6\u02c6(y, t) dy, (3.11)\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 9\nwhere we have taken a perturbation to the long\u2013time mean profile\n\u03b6 = \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y) + \u03b6\u02c6(y, t)eim\u03b8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.12)\nFor this study m = 2, although m is left arbitrary in the following equations for mathe-\nmatical clarity. Solving for \u03b6\u02c6(y, t) as in \u00a73.2, with the initial condition \u03b6\u02c6(y, 0+) = 0, and\nsubstituting this into the equation for \u03d5\u02c6 gives\n\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u2212m\u03b2pi2 \u03d5\u02c6\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\nK(t\u2212 s)\u03d5\u02c6(s) ds, (3.13)\nwhere the kernel\nK(t) = m\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2202y \u03b6\u00af\n\u221ee\u2212imyt dy. (3.14)\nSeeking a solution to (3.13) of the form \u03d5\u02c6 \u221d e\u03b3t leads to an implicit equation for the\ngrowth rate \u03b3:\n\u03b3 = \u2212m\u03b2pi\n2\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03b3uK(u) du. (3.15)\nSubstituting (3.8) into (3.14), integrating the kernel K(t) in (3.15) by parts and then\nusing residue calculations, we can express the equation for \u03b3 in the implicit form\n\u03b3 = \u2212mpi\n2\n\u2212 32m\n3\u03c1\n(pim+ 2\u03b3)3\n, (3.16)\nwhere \u03b2 has been set equal to unity, and\n\u03c1 = ipi\u0393\u2206r \u2212\n(\n\u22062r + \u2206\n2\ni \u2212\npi2\n4\n\u03932\n)\n(3.17)\nis a constant which depends on the initial conditions.\nFor an arbitrary set of initial conditions, equation (3.16) can be solved to give a complex\ngrowth rate \u03b3 = \u03b3r + i\u03b3i. We are interested in neutrally stable solutions of this equation\n(\u03b3r = 0) which will correspond to the initial condition producing persistent nonlinear\nsatellites. This is achieved by solving the quartic equation (3.16) for \u03b3 with some initial\nset of parameters (\u0393,\u2206r,\u2206i) and singling out the growth rate with the smallest real\npart. With two of these parameters fixed, the third is varied until \u03b3r = 0 whereupon a\nsecond parameter is then changed and the first is again updated until \u03b3r = 0. With the\nthird parameter held fixed, this maps out a curve in the two\u2013dimensional plane which\nsatisfies this constraint of neutral stability. For illustration we consider again the case\nwhen \u2206i = 0 and compare the neutral stability contour for this diagnostic (contour 2),\nwith the contour given by (3.10) for the inflexion point diagnostic (contour 1); these\ncontours are plotted in figure 2.\nFigure 2 shows that the neutral mode diagnostic (contour 2) produces a closed contour\nin the (\u0393,\u2206) plane, which has a much smaller region of decaying solutions than the\ninflection point diagnostic (contour 1). Both diagnostics agree at the points \u0393 = 0,\n\u2206 = \u00b1pi2\/4\u221a2 ' \u00b11.744, which are given in BLSY. We expect the actual threshold\ncontour of the fully nonlinear problem to differ from the neutral mode contour, because\nthe nonlinear effects not present in the neutral mode analysis are important for the\nformation of satellites.\n10 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\n4. Numerical simulation and the first bounce diagnostic\nThe two weakly nonlinear diagnostics formulated in \u00a73 depend only on the form of the\nlarge time vorticity perturbation \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y). The inflection point diagnostic is quite crude,\nand although the neutral mode diagnostic ensures a persistent perturbation, it is only\nbased on a weakly nonlinear development, and so discards the higher order Fourier modes\nand their interactions. In this section we formulate a nonlinear quantitative diagnostic\nwhich comes from the numerical solution of (2.13\u20132.15). Equation (2.13) is solved by\nexpanding \u03b6 \u2032 as a series of even Fourier harmonics:\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, t) =\nN\u2211\nn=\u2212N\n\u03b6 \u20322n(y, t)e\n2in\u03b8. (4.1)\nTo aid the numerical stability of our code, we introduce the diffusive term R\u22121eff \u2202\n2\ny\u03b6\n\u2032 to the\nright hand side of (2.13) (Hall et al. 2003b). The inclusion of this viscous term destroys\nany fine scale structure in the vorticity field, but this does not affect the threshold values\nwe calculate. Moreover, we have checked that for Reff \u2265 105 the results are insensitive to\nthe value of Reff : we set Reff = 105 and our results are, for practical purposes, inviscid.\nThis system of equations is then marched forward in time using a Crank\u2013Nicholson\nscheme for the advective and diffusive terms, and an Adam\u2013Bashforth method for the\nnonlinear terms. The coordinate y across the critical layer is treated via a finite difference\nscheme.\nFor simplicity the PDE (2.13) is discretized in the finite domain y \u2208 [\u2212L,L]; thus\nboundary conditions are imposed on \u03b6 \u20322n at y = \u00b1L for n = 0, 1, ..., N . This is achieved\nby considering the large\u2013y asymptotic form of the solutions for each \u03b6 \u20322n. It is possible to\ncalculate numerous terms in these asymptotic expansions, however for numerical accuracy\nit is sufficient to use just the leading order terms. The large\u2013y conditions imposed are\n\u03b6 \u20320 \u223c 2ity\u22121\n(\n\u0393\u03d5\u02c6\u2217e\u22122iyt \u2212 \u0393\u2217\u03d5\u02c6e2iyt) , (4.2)\n\u03b6 \u20322 \u223c \u2212\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6y\u22121 + \u03b2(\u2206\u2212 ipi\u0393\/2)y\u22121e\u22122iyt, (4.3)\n\u03b6 \u20324 \u223c 2it\u0393\u03d5\u02c6y\u22121e\u22122iyt, (4.4)\n\u03b6 \u20322n \u223c 0, \u2200 n > 2. (4.5)\nThe numerical solution of \u03d5\u02c6 contains oscillations which are due to the integral of \u3008\u03b6 \u20322\u3009\nin (2.14) being approximated over a finite range of y. These oscillations are removed at\nleading order by using (4.3) to approximate the integral in (2.14) outside the y \u2208 [\u2212L,L]\ndomain; this calculation is given in appendix A. This method however does not remove\nall the oscillations, which persist at the next order, and so we time average our solution\nto produce a smooth result, as is also described in appendix A.\nIn the present study we found it sufficient to set the parameter L = 20. For all the\nthreshold calculations in this paper we found using M = 5001 grid points in the y\u2013\ndirection and N = 32 equations to be the minimum values needed to give consistent\nresults. For nonlinear calculations (i.e. larger \u0393 and \u2206) just above the threshold for\nsatellite formation these should be increased to M = 8001 and N = 128.\nFigure 3 shows two results of the numerical solution of (2.13\u20132.15) when the initial\ncondition parameters \u0393 and \u2206 are both real. The correction to the mean azimuthal\nprofile \u03b6\u00af(y) is plotted at t = 40 and compared with the \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y) result in (3.8) for (a)\n(\u0393,\u2206) = (0, 0.3) and (b) (\u0393,\u2206) = (0.3, 0.3). For both cases the numerical solution (solid\nline) and the asymptotic model (dotted line) are in very good agreement with one another\nshowing that the numerical code works correctly. The small difference between the two\nmethods is due to higher order terms of the small amplitude expansion, and this difference\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 11\n(a) y\n8\u03b6\n(b) y\n8\u03b6\nFigure 3.

Figure\n4 shows |\u03d5\u02c6| on a log scale as a function of t for three runs with (\u0393,\u2206) = (0.2, 0.7) for curve\n1, (\u0393,\u2206) = (0.4, 0.9) for curve 2 and (\u0393,\u2206) = (0.4, 1.1) for curve 3. The parameter values\nfor curve 1 correspond to a case where |\u03d5\u02c6| decays to very small values very quickly, and\nnever increases again at large times. This is a weak initial condition run, where the vortex\nwould return to an axisymmetric state and the perturbation would wind up. Curve 3 in\nfigure 4 is a run with a strong initial condition for which |\u03d5\u02c6| rises in value after an initial\nperiod of decay and then oscillates about |\u03d5\u02c6| = 0.01. This corresponds to a case where\nsatellites form in the critical layer, as can be seen in the total vorticity plot in figure 5(b).\nIn this plot we can see the total vorticity \u03b6T = y+ \u03b6 winding around inside the satellites,\nand that due to the introduction of a non\u2013zero \u0393, these satellites are no longer situated\n12 M.

The arrows denote the first bounce as defined in BLSY.\nat y = 0 as they would be if \u0393 = 0 (see figure 16 of BLSY). Curve 2 in figure 4 represents\na case between the other two, where |\u03d5\u02c6| does rise after an initial period of decay, but it\ndoes not oscillate around quite as rapidly as curve 3. The total vorticity for curve 2 at\nt = 60 can be seen in figure 5(a). This plot again shows the vorticity winding around\nin the critical layer, but in this case the winding is not so clear, and also there is some\nbreaking up of the flow in the centre of the satellite. We shall see later that this case\nlies on the threshold between persistent satellites and decaying solutions. These three\nparameter values are plotted as the stars in figure 2 in \u00a73.\nThe study of BLSY determines whether or not generated cat\u2019s eyes persist or decay\naway by considering the \u2018first bounce\u2019 in the stream function, |\u03d5\u02c6(t)|. The first bounce\nis the position of the first maximum in the stream function that occurs after the initial\nexponential decay. The position of the first bounce is depicted by the arrows in figure\n6. When \u2206 & 0.1, |\u03d5\u02c6(t)| is a smooth function (see the solid line in figure 6), and so\nmeasuring the position of the first bounce is simple. However when \u2206 is small and \u0393 is\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 13\nmoderately large (see dashed line in figure 6), then there is a feed back from the vorticity\nin the critical layer to the stream function and vice versa. Thus |\u03d5\u02c6(t)| contains oscillations\nand so calculating the position of the first bounce is more complicated. For this case a\nfirst bounce fit is done by eye rather than calculating the position of this turning point\nin the time\u2013averaged stream function.\nIn their study, BLSY use as a criterion that if the first bounce occurs after t = 45 then\ncat\u2019s eyes do not persist. This time value places an upper bound on the threshold contour\nand avoids numerical error which can accumulate in long time integrations with small\nvalues of \u03d5\u02c6. As we find that our results are insensitive to the precise choice of this cut\u2013off\ntime, we adopt this same criterion for our study. To calculate the threshold curve for this\ndiagnostic with \u0393 and \u2206 real, we reduce \u2206 for a fixed \u0393 until the first bounce occurs after\nt = 45. This will generate a contour in the (\u0393,\u2206) plane within which satellites decay and\noutside which they persist.\nThe first bounce threshold described above is plotted as contour 3 in figure 2 along\nwith the inflection point threshold (contour 1) and the neutral mode threshold (contour\n2). We see that the first bounce threshold gives a much smaller region of the parameter\nspace where satellites decay, although the shape of this contour is very similar to that of\nthe neutral mode threshold and the difference between the two is only roughly a factor of\n2. The point on the contour where \u0393 = 0 (\u2206 ' 0.97) agrees exactly with the value for an\ninstantaneous kick (T = 0) in figure 13 of BLSY. Although increasing the cut\u2013off time\nt = 45 used in our criterion will bring the contour in slightly, the numerical evidence from\nsimulations of (2.13\u20132.15) is that the effect is very minor, the position of the contour is\ninsensitive to this choice and that for disturbances inside this contour the stream function\nultimately decays. In the next section we examine this statement further by running full\nnonlinear simulations of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations and comparing the results to the\nthreshold given by the asymptotic model.\n5. Comparison with Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nIn \u00a74 we calculated the first bounce threshold in parameter space using the asymptotic\ntheory of BLSY, within which satellites decay and the vortex returns to an axisymmetric\nstate and outside which they persist and the vortex remains elliptical. In this section we\nform a link from the parameter values in this asymptotic method to the parameter values\nrelated to full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations in (1.1), (1.3) and (1.4). Our simulations will\nshow that there is a region of parameter space where the asymptotic model agrees well\nwith the full numerical simulations, and outside this region, where the agreement is not\nso good, we offer explanations as to why this is the case. We fix m = 2 in what follows,\nwith the critical layer at r2 =\n\u221a\n2.\nIn the full simulations we solve the Navier\u2013Stokes equations using a numerical scheme\nwhich incorporates 128 even Fourier modes in the azimuthal \u03b8 direction and a finite\ndifference method consisting of 1500 points in the radial r direction. The code integrates\nthe time derivative and the diffusive term together using a Crank\u2013Nicholson scheme,\nwhile the nonlinear terms are incorporated explicitly via the Adam\u2013Bashforth method.\nFor more information on this numerical scheme see Turner & Gilbert (2007). The initial\ncondition used in the simulations is given by (1.1) where Z0(r) is as in (1.3), but here\nwe write\nZ2(r) =\nra\n4pi\n1\u2212 tanh ((r2 \u2212 \u03c322)\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c32)))\n1 + tanh (\u03c322\/(4(1\u2212 \u03c32)))\n, (5.1)\n14 M.

(5.2)\nThe reason for this is because now the maximum value of Z2(r) occurs at r = 1 for all\n\u03c32, which improves the comparison with the asymptotic theory as the position of the\nmaximum of Z2(r) now agrees with that of g(r) in (B 2). However, this form of Z2(r) is\nonly appropriate for \u03c32 > 0.65 because then a > 2 and the function Z2(r) is relatively\nsmooth at the origin.\nThe parameter \u03c3 in (1.3) is chosen close to 1 so that the vortex resembles a Rankine\nvortex plus a small asymptotic skirt \u000fZS(r) as in (1.5). Thus when calculating \u000fZS at\nthe critical layer r = r2, outside the core of the vortex, we identify this with Z0(r2).\nFigure 7 plots the vorticity profile (1.3) with \u03c3 = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 showing that as\n\u03c3 approaches 1 the profile tends to a Rankine vortex. The two parameters \u03b4 and \u03c32 in\n(1.3) and (5.1) are linked to the asymptotic parameters \u0393 and \u2206 via (2.7). For a fixed\nvalue of \u03c32, varying \u03b4 moves us along a straight line in the (\u0393,\u2206) plane, while changing\n\u03c32 varies the angle between this straight line and the line \u0393 = 0.\nFor the numerical simulations presented here, we set \u03c32 = \u03c3 and vary \u03c3. For each \u03c3 we\nran our numerical simulation for various values of \u03b4 and by considering the magnitude\nof the second multipole moment Q2(t) where, in general,\nQm(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nrm+1\u03b6m dr, (5.3)\nwe were able to determine if satellites persist, signaled by |Q2(t)| not decaying.

However as we will see shortly this Reynolds number maps to the effective\nReynolds number, Reff , for the asymptotic theory which in certain parameter ranges\nmay no longer be large enough to guarantee that the evolution is practically inviscid on\nthe (short) spatial and (long) temporal scales of the critical layer.\nFigure 9 plots Z \u20320(r2) against \u03b4, where our full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations are repre-\n16 M.

The solid line indicates the asymptotic result given by\ncontour 3 in figure 2, and Z \u20320(r2) \u2261 \u000fZ \u2032S(r2) is the small parameter from the BLSY the-\nory. The squares in figure 9 represent runs where the amplitude of the multipole moment\nQ2(t) decays sufficiently that the vortex enters a regime that is governed by the core of\nthe vortex (Bassom & Gilbert 1998) (see solid line in figure 8) and hence would not then\ngrow at a later time. The circles represent runs where the amplitude of the multipole\nmoment has not started to decay after a sufficiently long run (up to t = 5\u00d7 104). We see\nthat the agreement between the numerical simulations and the asymptotic theory im-\nproves as the small parameter Z \u20320(r2) decreases, which is as expected because this value\nis equivalent to the small parameter \u000f in the asymptotic theory. Note that the range of\ngood agreement occurs for Z \u20320(r2) \u2264 0.021 (\u03c3 \u2265 0.8); by examining the vorticity profiles\nin figure 7 we can see that the \u03c3 = 0.8 profile is actually quite broad and thus this\nasymptotic theory agrees well with the numerical simulations for reasonably broad vor-\ntices as well ones with sharper edges. However, for Z \u20320(r2) \u2264 0.0132 (or \u03c3 \u2265 0.84) we find\nthat the good agreement begins to evaporate: at parameter values where satellites should\npersist according to the asymptotic model, the full simulation shows decay. This can be\nexplained by considering the Reynolds number R from the full numerical simulations and\nthe effective Reynolds number of the asymptotic theory Reff based on the spatial and\ntemporal scales in the critical layer; these both conspire to make Reff much less than R\nfor small \u000f. More specifically, these two quantities are related via the expression\nR\u22121eff = R\n\u22121 \u000f\u22123L\u22122T , (5.4)\nwhere L and T are the length and time scales given in (B 7) of appendix B (Hall et al.\n2003b). When the limiting compact vortex is the Rankine vortex, as for our simulations,\nwe obtain\nR\u22121eff =\n8\n\u221a\n2 R\u22121\npi2|Z \u20320(r2)|3\n. (5.5)\nThe effective Reynolds number for the case when R = 107 is plotted in figure 10. For\nthe values of 0.016 < Z \u20320(r2) < 0.021 we obtain good agreement between the numerical\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 17\n\u22123\n3\n\u22123 3\n\u22123\n3\n\u22123 3\nt=6000\nt=2000t=0\nt=4000\nx x\ny\ny\nFigure 11. Plot of the vorticity Z showing persistent negative satellites for \u03c3 = \u03c32 = 0.8 and\n\u03b4 = 0.2212. The vorticity is capped at |Z| = 0.0001 (white), zero vorticity appears as gray and\nnegative vorticity is black.\nsimulations and the asymptotic theory (see figure 9) and we see from figure 10 that\nthe effective diffusivity R\u22121eff is reasonably small in this region. Thus any diffusive effects\ndue to the critical layer being very thin are small, and the results are the same as the\nasymptotic theory in \u00a74, where we fixed Reff = 105. For Z \u20320(r2) > 0.021, R\u22121eff decreases\nfurther and so the reason for the disagreement between the results in figure 9 in this\nregion is not due to diffusive effects, but is simply that our vorticity profile Z0(r) is no\nlonger close enough to the asymptotic limit of Rankine vortex plus a skirt of vanishing\nstrength.\nHowever, as we decrease Z \u20320(r2) from 0.016 our vorticity profile becomes much more like\na Rankine vortex plus a skirt, so we expect our full simulations to agree better with the\nasymptotic theory. Unfortunately because the critical layer becomes thinner, the effective\nReynolds number decreases and diffusive effects become more significant. This problem\ncan be overcome by increasing the Reynolds number R of the full simulation. When a\nsimulation plotted in figure 9 shows persisting satellites, we observe that increasing R\ndoes not make them decay, but it can make a decaying simulation grow or persist by\nmaking the problem more inviscid. Results of the full simulation with R = 108, 109 and\n1010 show that the decay observed above the solid line in figure 9 for Z \u20320(r2) < 0.016\nappears to turn into persistence and growth, while the parameter values below the line\nstill give decay. However, at these large Reynolds numbers the full numerical simulation\ncould not be run for the same length of time as the R = 107 case; although we could not\nverify that these results would persist to the same accuracy as in figure 9, the evidence we\nhave does suggest this is the case. Overall, we believe that our numerical results indicate\nthat the asymptotic theory is correct, and discrepancies for very sharp vortices are down\nto the limits of running simulations at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.\n18 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nIn the asymptotic theory the sign of vorticity in the critical layer is of secondary\nconsideration as the constant \u03930 in (2.5) has no influence on the dynamics. Thus when\nsatellites are formed they could equally well be positive, cat\u2019s eyes or negative satellites\ngiving a tripole, depending on the value of \u03930. We note that a similar issue arises in\nthe Navier\u2013Stokes simulations, as a constant can be added to the initial vorticity profile,\ncorresponding to working in a rotating frame. This has led us to conclude that both a\ntripole and a vortex with cat\u2019s eyes amount to the same nonlinear structure, but the sign\nof the vorticity in the satellites is entirely dependent on the average level of vorticity\naround the critical layer initially.\nWe highlight this below with a typical Navier\u2013Stokes simulation. The form of the\ninitial vorticity profile (1.1) is that of a positive elliptical core with two negative regions\nof vorticity above and below the core (with m = 2), this can be seen in the t = 0\npanel of figure 11. Figure 11 shows the evolution of an initial vorticity distribution with\n\u03c32 = \u03c3 = 0.8 and \u03b4 = 0.2212. This case is one which has persistent satellites. The\nvorticity plotted is capped at |Z| = 10\u22124. The positive vorticity is white in the figure,\ngrey signifies zero vorticity and the black regions are regions of negative vorticity. We\nsee in figure 11 that the satellites do persist for long times, and the vorticity in the\ncritical layer includes negative inclusions (depicted as black). This means that this is a\ntripole with a positive core and two negative satellites rotating around it as in figure\n1. However, adding on the constant Zmin to the initial profile (1.1), where Zmin is the\nminimum vorticity in the run depicted in figure 11, would produce a vortex with the\nsame structure as in figure 11 except the black regions would now correspond to regions\nof positive vorticity. Note that we could add on a constant globally, or just locally within\nthe critical layer by modifying the initial profile.\nThe simulation with \u03b4 = 0.2212 in figure 11 is well above the threshold for persistent\nsatellites, as can be seen in figure 9. For simulations just above the threshold for persis-\ntence, the satellites are very thin and viscous effects come into play: in a plot similar to\nfigure 11 it would be difficult to see the sign of the vorticity in the critical layer, and so\nwhether there are positive or negative satellites present.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have studied the evolution of a sharp edged vortex with an additive\nperturbation via both asymptotic and numerical methods. We adapt the asymptotic\ntheory of BLSY so that we can stipulate an initial amplitude of mode m vorticity in\nthe critical layer and an initial stream function amplitude of the perturbation. In the\ncase when these two parameters are real we were able to construct a contour in this\nparameter space, within which the stream function decays in time and the vortex returns\nto an axisymmetric state and outside which the vortex remains elliptical and a satellite\nstructure persists in the vortex. The results from this paper were all constructed with\nZ2(r) real, and hence \u0393 and \u2206 real, to agree with the studies of Rossi et al. (1997)\nand Barba & Leonard (2007), but could be extended to cover the full three\u2013dimensional\nparameter space. Also it should be noted that these results are universal in that they\napply to any family of vortices for which the BLSY theory becomes valid, in other words\nwhich asymptotically have the structure of a compact vortex supporting a normal mode,\nplus a weak skirt of vorticity. Thus by considering the family of compact vortices in\nBLSY one could calculate \u0393 and \u2206, via (B 10) and (B 13), for the Gaussian profiles used\nby Rossi et al. (1997) and Barba & Leonard (2007), and hence qualitatively verify their\nresults.\nWe compared our first bounce threshold from the nonlinear study to two thresholds\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 19\nbased on weakly nonlinear theory, an inflection point threshold and a neutral mode\nthreshold. The inflection point threshold was very crude and did not agree well with the\nfirst bounce threshold, however the neutral mode threshold agreed in shape with the first\nbounce threshold and was only out by a factor of two in magnitude.\nThe first bounce threshold was compared to full numerical simulations of the Navier\u2013\nStokes equations. These simulations showed that as our core vortex approached a Rankine\nvortex plus an asymptotic skirt the numerical results agree well with the asymptotic\nresults while the effective Reynolds number was large. The Navier\u2013Stokes simulations,\nlike the BLSY model, are unaffected by the addition of a constant vorticity initially. This\nhas led us to conclude that these satellite structures successfully describe both multipole\nand cat\u2019s eye vortices, i.e these two types of vortices are essentially the same, except their\nazimuthal averaged profiles will be different (Barba & Leonard 2007; Turner & Gilbert\n2007). In the context of geophysical applications and two\u2013dimensional turbulence, sharp\nedged vortices are common place and our study indicates that the thresholds for the\nformulation of tripole structures will tend to be low in cases when the critical layer lies\nbeyond the sharp edge. Of course continual external forcing of such vortices is likely to\nlead generally to a more complex vorticity structure in the layer, and a \u2018surf zone\u2019 can\noccur (Thuburn & Lagneau 1999). The enhanced mixing that occurs in such zones can\nin tern sharpen up the edge of the vortex, and this interaction of mixing and profile\nevolution is currently under investigation in random and deterministic contexts.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was undertaken on the EPSRC grant EP\/D032202\/1.

We found that varying L produces consistent time\u2013averaged results.\nAppendix B. Asymptotic theory\nIn this appendix we give a brief overview of quantities from the derivation of the\nasymptotic theory used in the paper in particular (B 10), (B 13) and (B 24). The reader\nis directed to BLSY for more detailed information. We seek an asymptotic solution for\nthe total vorticity Z of the Navier\u2013Stokes equation in the form\nZ(r) = ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r) + \u000f2\u03b60 + \u000f3\u03b61 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (B 1)\nThe quantity ZC(r) is the vorticity profile of a compact vortex, which we take to be a\nRankine vortex in the main paper, ZS(r) is an asymptotic skirt and \u000f\u001c 1. In the main\nbody of the paper the quantity ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r) is combined into the full profile Z0(r),\nwhich is the tanh profile for our full simulations.\nWe consider perturbations to the compact vortex: such a vortex may support a family\nof (undamped) Kelvin waves, at most one for each mode m. Each Kelvin wave has a\ncritical radius rm, where the vortex and the fluid co\u2013rotate with angular frequency \u03c9m.\nWe let the functions f(r) and g(r) be the corresponding linear perturbations to the\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 21\nstream function and vorticity. For the Rankine vortex these are\nfm(r) =\n{\n(rmr)m, (r < 1),\n(rm\/r)m, (r > 1),\ngm(r) = \u22122mrmm\u03b4(r \u2212 1). (B 2)\nOutside the critical layer at r = rm, the solution is the Kelvin wave with a complex\namplitude that evolves, slowly, according to the behaviour in the critical layer,\n[\u03c80, \u03b60] = a(\u03d1, \u03c4)[f(r), g(r)]. (B 3)\nHere \u03d1 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9mt, \u03c4 = \u000ft is a slow timescale and a(\u03d1, \u03c4) = a\u02c6(\u03c4)eim\u03d1 + c.c. is the\namplitude function, where rm = (m\/(m \u2212 1))1\/2. In deriving (2.1\u20132.4) the following\nquantities appear\nI1 = \u2212\n\u222b RC\n0\nrfg\nmrm\u2126\u02dcC\ndr, \u2126\u02dcC \u2261 \u2126C(r)\u2212 \u2126C(rm), (B 4)\nwhere RC is the radius of the compact vortex, beyond which ZC = 0.\nThe gradient of the vorticity inside the critical layer scales as\n\u03b2 \u2261 sgn(\u00b5m) = \u2212sgn (Z \u2032S(rm)) , (B 5)\nwhere\n\u00b5m \u2261 Z\n\u2032\nS(rm)\nrm\u2126\u02dc\u2032C(rm)\n. (B 6)\nWhen \u03b2 = \u22121 the vortex has a positive skirt and hence gives unstable solutions. As we\nare only interested in stable solutions we set \u03b2 = 1 in this study.

(B 7)\nTo determine the constants \u0393 and \u2206 in terms of \u03b4 and Zm(r), consider the initial\nvorticity distribution of the fully nonlinear Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nZ = ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r) + \u03b4Zm(r)eim\u03b8 + c.c., (B 8)\nwhere \u03b4 and the form of the mode Zm(r) determine the values of \u0393 and \u2206. In this\nappendix we show how these parameters are related to the parameter \u03b4 of the fully\nnonlinear problem. In the critical layer at t = 0 we compare the expansion (B 8) with\nZ = ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r) + \u000f2\u03b60(r, \u03b8) + \u000f3\u03b61(r, \u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (B 9)\nOmitting some details on the scalings (to be found in BLSY), when this is rescaled we\nfind the amplitude of the mode m in the critical layer to be\n\u0393 =\nT\nrm|\u00b5m| \u000f\n\u22122\u03b4Zm(rm) =\nrmI1\u2126\u02dc\u20322C(rm)\n\u000f2Z \u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Zm(rm). (B 10)\nOutside the critical layer we compare (B 8) at t = 0 with the expansion\nZ = ZC(r) + \u000fZS(r) + \u000f2a\u02c6(0)g(r)eim\u03b8 + c.c.+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (B 11)\nwhere the function g(r) for a Rankine vortex is defined in (B 2). At leading order we\ncan neglect the effect of the skirt and just consider perturbations to the compact vortex\nZ = ZC . The initial perturbation \u03b4Zm(r)eim\u03b8 will excite the normal mode by an amount\nwe call \u03b4Pm and it will also excite the continuous spectrum. The latter perturbations\nwill wind up and become finely scaled on the fast t\u2212timescale, and hence are irrelevant.\n22 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nHowever the perturbation to the normal mode will evolve on the slow \u03c4\u2212timescale and\nso will be significant.\nIt is sufficient to write the initial condition as\na\u02c6(0) = \u000f\u22122\u03b4Pm, (B 12)\nwhere Pm is the projection onto the normal mode, to be determined shortly. Rescaling\nthis initial condition we find\n\u2206 = \u03d5\u02c6(0) =\nT\nrmL a\u02c6(0) = \u2212\nrmI21 \u2126\u02dc\u20323C(rm)\n\u000f2Z \u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Pm. (B 13)\nTo find the value of the projection Pm we consider the linearized form of the Navier\u2013\nStokes equation by writing\n\u03b6 = \u03b60(r) + \u03b6m(r, t)eim\u03b8 and \u03c8 = \u03c80(r) + \u03c8m(r, t)eim\u03b8. (B 14)\nWe then take the Laplace transform of the resulting equation with respect to t, with\nf\u00afm(p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\neiptfm(t) dt, fm(t) = \u2212 12pi\n\u222b \u2212\u221e+i\u03b3\n\u221e+i\u03b3\ne\u2212iptf\u00afm(p) dp. (B 15)\nIt can be shown that the Laplace transform of the multipole moment Qm(t) in (5.3) can\nbe written as\nQ\u00afm(p) = lim\nr0\u2192\u221e\n\u2212 ir\nm\n0\n\u03a8L(r0, p)\n\u222b r0\n0\ns\u03a8L(s, p)\u03b6m(s, 0)\nm\u2126C(s)\u2212 p ds, (B 16)\n(Schecter et al. 2000; Turner & Gilbert 2007), where \u03a8L(r, p) satisfies the homogeneous\nequation [\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u2212 m\n2\nr2\n+\nmZ \u2032C(r)\nr(p\u2212m\u2126C(r))\n]\n\u03a8L(r, p) = 0, (B 17)\nwith \u03a8L(0, p) = 0. Here r = r0 is a large radius, that is taken to be finite and then\nallowed to tend to infinity. When (B 16) is inverted to find Qm(t), the inversion contour\nis closed around any singularities in the p\u2212plane. These singularities can occur because\nof the normal mode, when \u03a8L(r0 \u2192 \u221e, p) vanishes for some p, or because m\u2126C(s) \u2212 p\nvanishes for some s in the range 0 to \u221e. The second of these is the continuous spectrum\nof the vortex, which may be bent below the real p\u2212axis by moving the s\u2212contour above\nthe real s\u2013axis in (B 16) (Briggs et al. 1970; Schecter et al. 2000).\nExamining (B 17) shows that this is exactly the equation satisfied by the functions f(r)\nand g(r) and thus the solution for the normal mode is p = m\u03c9m and \u03a8L(r, p) = f(r, p).\nNow inverting (B 16) by deforming the contour around the singularity at p = m\u03c9m only,\nwe find that\nQm(t) = \u2212iR\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf(s,m\u03c9m)\u03b6m(s, 0)\nm(\u2126C(r)\u2212 \u03c9m) ds e\n\u2212im\u03c9mt, (B 18)\nwhere R is the residue at p = m\u03c9m,\nR = Res\np=m\u03c9m\n[\nlim\nr0\u2192\u221e\n(\n\u2212 ir\nm\n0\nf(r0, p)\n)]\n. (B 19)\nTo calculate Pm from this expression, we calculate Qm(0) for our initial condition Zm(r)\nand we divide by QNMm (0) for the normal mode, where \u03b6m(r, 0) is replaced by g(r) and\nthe corresponding projection Pm = 1 by definition. We find that\nQNMm (0) = iRrmI1, (B 20)\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two\u2013dimensional vortices 23\nand thus\nPm = \u2212I\u221211\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf(s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u2126\u02dcC(s)\nds, (B 21)\nwhere the contour of integration is bent above the singularity at rm given by \u2126\u02dcC(rm) = 0.\nAs we have bent the contour above the pole at rm we can write the expression for Pm\nas a principal value integral plus a contribution from the pole,\nPm = \u2212I\u221211\n(\nPV\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf(s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u2126\u02dcC(s)\nds\u2212 ipi\nm\nZm(rm)\n\u2126\u02dc\u2032C(rm)\n)\n. (B 22)\nHowever we realise that the imaginary part here looks familiar: on its own, when inserted\ninto \u2206 in (B 13) it gives a term\n\u2212 ipi\nm\nrmI1\u2126\u02dc\u20322C(rm)\n\u000f2Z \u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Zm(rm). (B 23)\nFor m = 2, this is precisely \u2212ipi\/2 times the quantity \u0393 and what we are recovering is\nthe initial delta\u2013function forcing of the quasi\u2013mode amplitude \u2206 by the vorticity in the\ncritical layer, a quantity we disentangled in (2.15). This is a useful check, but to avoid\naccounting for this twice we delete the imaginary part of Pm to leave as our definition\nPm = \u2212I\u221211 PV\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf(s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u2126\u02dcC(s)\ndr. (B 24)\nwhich in the case of the Rankine vortex amounts to (2.8).\nREFERENCES\nBajer, K., Bassom, A. P. & Gilbert, A. D. 2001 Accelerated diffusion in the centre of a\nvortex. J.
