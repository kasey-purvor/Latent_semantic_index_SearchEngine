The first prospect is at Arthrath, near the town of Ellon, and the second, in the southeastern corner of the Knock intrusion, near the town of Huntly, around the farms of Littlemill and Auchencrieve. Both prospects occur within a group of mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks known as the Younger Basic intrusions, emplaced broadly synchronously with the later stages of Ordovician amphibolite-facies metamorphism of metasedimentary units of the Dalradian Supergroup. We have re-examined the available samples from the Ni\u2013Cu exploration program in terms of their PGE potential, placing particular emphasis on the less-well-known Arthrath prospect. PGE abundances of up to 418 ppb Pt (Littlemill) and 458 ppb Pd (Arthrath) associated with zones of Cu\u2013Ni\u2013Fe sulfide mineralization have been identified. At Arthrath, the Pd is hosted primarily in merenskyite enclosed in base-metal sulfide; the occurrences of platinum-group minerals define a bimodal distribution. At Littlemill, the occurrences of platinum-group minerals involve mobilization and redeposition of precious metals in sheared rocks enclosed within the base-metal sulfide zones. When the mineral compositions of all the rocks associated with the zones of Cu\u2013Ni\u2013PGE mineralization are considered relative to the known differentiation series present within these intrusions, a model involving the mixing and mingling of relatively late, primitive magma and pre-existing differentiates is favored for both prospects. In particular, a cumulate orthopyroxenite unit at Arthrath closely associated with a zone of Cu\u2013Ni\u2013PGE mineralization is directly interpreted as the result of the influx into a magma chamber of a late, primitive magma.
