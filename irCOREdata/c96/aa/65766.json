If Propertius had never\nwritten his final book of poetry, we might characterize him on the\nbasis of his earlier books as the quintessential Latin love elegist: he\nrejects not only a military career, but even the less demanding task of\ncelebrating Augustus\u2019 victories, in favour of the love elegist\u2019s\nself-indulgent life of leisure: cf. e.g. Prop. 2.1.39\u201346. In the first poem\nof Book 4, however, Propertius announces what appears to be a\nwholly different poetic programme; in place of the erotic elegies of the\nprevious books is a new \u2018serious\u2019 purpose: Propertius will sing about\nnational, religious and antiquarian themes, as the \u2018Roman Calli-\nmachus\u2019 (Propertius 4.1a.63\u20134). However, as soon as the next poem,2\nPropertius is commanded to return to his usual theme of obsessive\nelegiac love for one woman, a topic described as haec tua castra (\u2018this\nis your sphere of operations\u2019, 4.1b.135). The poems which follow in\nPropertius 4 tend to strike a balance between antiquarian seriousness\nand elegiac frivolity. For example, in 4.4, Propertius relates the Vestal\nVirgin Tarpeia\u2019s betrayal of Rome, connecting several contemporary\nurban landmarks with the poem\u2019s heroine, but he remains true to his\nearlier colours by presenting Tarpeia as an elegiac lover who falls in\nlove at first sight and betrays her city out of passion.3 In 4.10,\nhowever, Propertius seems to live up to his grand task: in this short\nGreece & Rome, Vol. 54, No. 1, \u00a9 The Classical Association, 2007.

All rights reserveddoi: 10.1017\/S0017383507000046PROPERTIUS 4. AND THE END OF THE AENEID\nelegy, Propertius explains the origin of the ancient cult title Jupiter\n\u2018Feretrius\u2019. He relates the three occasions in Roman history on which\nthe Roman commander-in-chief had won the right to dedicate the\nspolia opima, Rome\u2019s highest military honour, by slaughtering his\nenemy counterpart in single combat. At the end of the poem,\nPropertius offers two etymologies for Feretrius which connect it with\nthe spolia opima; spoils which were, after their capture, dedicated to\nJupiter Feretrius, and placed in his temple.\nComparatively little has been written about Propertius 4.10.\nPropertian scholars seem to find it uncongenial; it is hardly typical of\nthe poet, given its aspirations to generic grandeur, focus on military\nminutiae and the gory reality of Roman warfare, and what is seen as\nits dry, antiquarian subject-matter.4 S. J. Harrison provides a good\nantidote to this last complaint: he persuasively argues that Propertius\n4.10 is far from antiquarian, but that it is rather intensely engaged\nwith contemporary concerns.5 Scholars usually date the publication of\nPropertius 4 to some time after 16 BC.6 Over a decade previously, the\nspolia opima had become a live political issue: in 29 BC, Marcus\nLicinius Crassus, the grandson of the famous triumvir, had claimed\nthe right to dedicate the spolia opima, after killing Deldo, the king\nof the Bastarnae, in single combat.7 Augustus had disputed Crassus\u2019\nclaim on a religious and legal technicality, arguing that Crassus\nwas ineligible for the honour given that Augustus himself was the\ncommander-in-chief of the Roman forces, because only he had the\nauthority to take the auspices upon which the success of each and\nevery battle depended.8 This would be rather like Roy Keane going\n62 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n4 For a negative assessment of the poem, cf. e.g. L. Richardson, Propertius. Elegies I\u2013IV\n(Norman, OK, 1976), 476: \u2018Propertius describes his undertaking as \u201cmagnum iter\u201d (3), the\nexplanation of the cult of Jupiter Feretrius, but he seems soon to tire of it; each successive story\nis told in shorter space and with less color. The announcement of his subject in the first two\ncouplets and the beginning of the Romulus story is lofty and organ-voiced; the conclusion is\nprosaic and obvious; it almost limps to a halt.\u2019 Symptomatic of the neglect into which 4.10 has\nfallen is the fact that it is allotted merely a long note (which is however useful on the subversive\naspect of the poem, and cites other recent scholarship) in Janan\u2019s recent monograph on Prop. 4:\ncf. M. Janan, The Politics of Desire. Propertius IV (London, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2001),\n197\u20138, n. 13. Since completing this paper, I have come across a treatment of 4.10 that reaches\nsome similar conclusions to the independent arguments I make, in Tara S. Welch\u2019s The Elegiac\nCityscape. Propertius and the Meaning of Roman Monuments (Columbus, 2005), 133\u201365.\n5 S. J. Harrison, \u2018Augustus, the Poets, and the spolia opima\u2019, CQ 39 (1989), 408\u201314.\n6 See W. A. Camps, Propertius. Elegies. Book IV (Cambridge, 1965), 1.\n7 Cf. H. I. Flower, \u2018The Tradition of the Spolia Opima: M. Claudius Marcellus and Augus-\ntus\u2019, Cl. Ant. 19.1 (2000), 57\u20138, for the prominent place occupied by a statue of Romulus with\nthe spolia opima in the Forum Augustum.\n8 Cf. the way in which triumphs become the preserve of the imperial family and Augustus in\nparticular in his principate: J. M. Carter, Suetonius: Diuus Augustus (Bristol, 1982) on Suet. Aug.\n38.1; G. K. Galinsky, \u2018The Triumph Theme in the Augustan Elegy\u2019, WS 3 (1969), 77; and\nR. Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford, 1939), 404.\nup to collect the FA Cup after scoring the match-winning penalty for\nManchester United, only for Malcolm Glazer to step in and prevent\nhis captain from laying claim to the trophy; as owner of the team, he\nhas the ultimate right to it.9 Harrison further argues that support for\nthe Augustan line on the spolia opima can also be inferred from refer-\nences found in Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, published only a few years before\nPropertius 4.10.10\nMy discussion offers a close reading of Propertius 4.10 which\ndiffers somewhat from the assessments of scholars such as Harrison\n(n. 5). I suggest that this poem takes its status as Roman martial\npoetry far from seriously; I propose that it is therefore much closer to\nthe other poems found in Propertius 4. Harrison should be\ncommended for providing a salutary reminder of the contemporary\naspect of this poem; however, I read the political affiliations of the\npoem rather differently, suggesting that the poem serves to undermine\nthe position of the princeps rather than endorsing Augustus\u2019 claims to\nmilitary supremacy. The interpretation of the political standpoint of\n4.10 is open to debate; but my reading of the poem as subversive\nrather than supportive of Augustus fits better with Propertius\u2019\nprevious disengagement from the Augustan regime, as expressed in\npoems such as 2.7, in which Propertius refuses to beget sons to die for\nAugustus\u2019 imperial mission, or 4.6, where Propertius neatly sidesteps\na description of the future Augustus\u2019 victory at the battle of Actium\nwith bella satis cecini (\u2018I have sung enough of wars\u2019, 4.6.69). In the\nsecond part of this article, I consider the treatment of the spolia opima\nin the Aeneid. The interpretation of political material in the Aeneid is\nof course vexed and hotly debated;11 nevertheless, I argue that both\nPropertius\u2019 approach to the issue of the spolia opima and one of the\nmajor devices in the treatment of the spoils in 4.10 could be seen to\nderive at least in part from Virgil;12 a case perhaps of Propertius\nreading the Aeneid as subversive of the Augustan line, rather than of\nsubversion within the Aeneid itself.\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 63\n9 Apologies for this analogy to those readers who are not British; I here attempt to follow\nPropertius in making topical reference to national concerns.\n10 On Virgil and the spoils, see Harrison (n. 5), 412\u201314.\n11 See e.g. S. J. Harrison, Oxford Readings in Vergil\u2019s Aeneid (Oxford, 1990), 1\u201320 for an\noverview. For \u2018pessimistic\u2019 readings of the Aen., cf. e.g. M. A. Parry, \u2018The Two Voices of Virgil\u2019s\nAeneid\u2019, Arion 2 (1963), 66\u201380 and M. J. Putnam, The Poetry of the Aeneid. Four Studies in Imag-\ninative Unity and Design (Cambridge, MA, 1965); for \u2018optimistic\u2019 readings, cf. e.g. P. R. Hardie,\nVirgil\u2019s Aeneid. Cosmos and Imperium (Oxford, 1986); and G. K. Galinsky, Augustan Culture\n(Princeton, 1996).\n12 The move towards silence: see below.\nLet us turn now to 4.10 itself. The poem opens thus:\nNunc Iouis incipiam causas aperire Feretri\narmaque de ducibus trina recepta tribus.\nmagnum iter ascendo, sed dat mihi gloria uires:\nnon iuuat e facili lecta corona iugo. (4.10.1\u20134)\nNow I shall begin to reveal the origins of Feretrian Jove\nand arms, three sets, received from three leaders.\nIt is a great path I ascend, but glory gives me strength:\na crown picked from an easy height is not pleasing.\nHarrison reads Propertius\u2019 repetition in the second line of three\n(trina, tribus; picked up in the penultimate couplet by tria, 45) as an\nimplicit, prominently placed statement of political allegiance, lending\nsupport to Augustus\u2019 refusal to allow Crassus to become the fourth\nRoman general to dedicate the spoils.13 The matter is settled,\naccording to Harrison\u2019s interpretation of 4.10; there have been only\nthree winners of the spoils. However, given that the controversy over\nthe award of the spolia opima in 29 BC was fraught with the potential\nfor embarrassment to Augustus, it might have been more tactful for\nPropertius to avoid the topic, in the light of his previous refusal to\nsing of Augustus\u2019 military success.14\nFurthermore, I detect a sly allusion to Augustus\u2019 role in the\nCrassus debacle of 29 BC in these opening lines. The word order and\ncombination of the supreme king of the gods with poetic beginnings\n(Nunc Iouis incipiam)15 evokes, among other texts, the opening of\nTheocritus\u2019 Encomium of Ptolemy (Idyll 17):16\n(Id. 17.1\u20134)\n64 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n13 Harrison (n. 5), 411.\n14 Cf. Ovid\u2019s emphasis in Tristia 2 upon recent episodes of Roman history which might have\nbeen embarrassing to the princeps: see T. Wiedemann, \u2018The Political Background to Ovid\u2019s\nTristia 2\u2019, CQ 25 (1975), 264\u201371.\n15 Both poems have as their second word the name of the supreme deity in the genitive,\nfollowed by a verb meaning \u2018begin\u2019.\n16 The same three words also open Aratus\u2019 Phaenomena, which continues, with nice irony if\nread in the light of Prop. 4.10: \/ (\u2018we mortal men never\nleave him unnamed\u2019).\nFrom Zeus let us begin and with Zeus you should cease, Muses,\nthe best of the immortals, whenever we sing in songs.\nBut, again, of men let Ptolemy be named among the foremost\nand last and in the middle; for he is pre-eminent among men.\nWhat are we to make of the allusion to a poem which presents the\nmove from praise of the supreme god to flattery of his human coun-\nterpart, Ptolemy Philadelphus, as natural? Does it set 4.10 up as an\nimplicit encomium of Augustus, first among men in Propertius\u2019 own\nday, and frequently associated with the king of the gods in Augustan\npoetry, cult and visual arts?17 If we read the allusion in this way, the\npraise of Augustus seems compromised, given that Augustus\u2019 connec-\ntion with the spolia opima is hardly a suitable topic for court poetry.\nOr should we read 4.10 as reneging on the implicit promise of\nPropertius\u2019 opening words that he will follow Theocritus in writing a\npoem in praise of the contemporary \u2018first among men\u2019? Propertius\nwould thereby hint that he might write praise of Augustus, but cannot\ndo so in this poem; were he to move from the supreme god to the\nsupreme human leader, he would be faced only with an embarrassing\nsituation which did not reflect well upon Augustus, who ensures his\npre-eminence among men by refusing to allow honours to anyone but\nhimself. However we choose to read the allusion to Theocritus, it at\nleast ensures the princeps a palpable presence in the poem where\nprevious critics have detected only his absence; other allusions to\nAugustus are noted below.\nTo return to the opening of Propertius\u2019 poem, the first four lines\nannounce an explicit set of poetic ambitions and allegiances. The\nopening line\u2019s causas is the closest that Latin can get to the Greek\n, the title of Callimachus\u2019 ambitious poem about origins. By this\nallusion to Callimachus\u2019 elegiac work in four books, Propertius\nappears to live up to his earlier claim that he is the Roman\nCallimachus. Given Propertius\u2019 declared Callimachean affiliations, it\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 65\n17 For the association of the two in Propertius, cf. perhaps 2.7.4\u20135 (non queat inuitos Iuppiter\nipse duos. \/ \u2018at magnus Caesar.\u2019 sed magnus Caesar in armis, \u2018Jupiter himself is not able [to part]\ntwo against their will. \/ \u201cBut Caesar is great.\u201d But Caesar is great in arms\u2019), 3.4.6 (assuescunt\nLatio Partha tropaea Ioui, \u2018Parthian trophies become accustomed to Roman Jove\u2019), 3.9.47 (to\nMaecenas: te duce uel Iouis arma canam [. . . , \u2018with you as leader I shall sing even the arms of\nJove\u2019), 4.6.13\u201315 (Caesaris in nomen ducuntur carmina: Caesar \/ dum canitur, quaeso, Iuppiter, ipse\nuaces, \u2018Songs are spun in honour of Caesar; Caesar \/ being the poetic theme, I beg your atten-\ntion, Jupiter\u2019). Elsewhere, the equation is clear at e.g. Virgil, Ecl. 1.6ff.; Hor. Carm. 1.12.50 with\nR. G. M. Nisbet and M. Hubbard, A Commentary on Horace: Odes 1 (Oxford, 1970) ad loc.,\n3.5.1\u20133, Epist. 1.16.27\u20139; Ovid, Met. 1.204\u20135, 15.850ff. (especially 858\u201360), Fast. 1.608,\n2.130\u20132, Tr. 2.33ff.; J. R. Fears, \u2018The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology\u2019, ANRW\nII.17.1 (1981), 3\u2013141; and P. Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (Ann Arbor,\n1988), 230ff.\nis to say the least unexpected that Propertius also seems to take on the\ntask of the epic, martial poet:18 arma, the opening word of the second\nline, and the other theme of this poem, establishes Propertius\u2019 epic\npretensions, recalling the martial concerns and the opening word \u2013\nand hence alternative title \u2013 of the Aeneid.19 However, the position of\narma at the start of the elegiac pentameter rather than the epic\nhexameter suggests that the treatment of the arma may be elegiac\nrather than epic20 \u2013 Propertius can write about arma and still claim to\nbe following his elegiac predecessor Callimachus21 \u2013 and also reveals\nPropertius\u2019 interest in the \u2018incipits\u2019 of poems. The \u2018incipit\u2019 here is\nsuggestive: the poem purports to delve deep into Rome\u2019s historical\npast in its quest for the origins of Feretrian Jove, but Propertius\nimplies the contemporary relevance of his discussion of the spolia\nopima as early as the poem\u2019s first word: nunc.\nIn keeping with the poem\u2019s aetiological and epic aspirations,\nPropertius characterizes his poem in lines 3\u20134 as more elevated than\nhis previous output: ascendo refers to his generic ascent, and magnum\nprovides a striking contrast with elegy\u2019s usual self-presentation as\nsmall or slight. However, the grandeur is undercut if we read ascendo\nliterally, as a reference to Propertius\u2019 physical ascent to the Temple of\nJupiter Feretrius, perched on the summit of the Capitoline hill.22 The\nimage of the potentially (physically and generically) unfit poet toiling\nup the hill, spurred on by hope of glory, is faintly comical.23\n66 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n18 Cf. the complaints of the Telchines at the start of the Aetia that Callimachus has not\nproduced \/....... ... \/ ......\n(\u2018one continuous song on kings or heroes in thousands of lines\u2019, Aetia 1.3\u20135 Pfeiffer); the subject\nmatter of heroes and kings is famously rendered as reges et proelia (\u2018kings and battles\u2019) by Virgil\nin Callimachean mode at Ecl. 6.3.\n19 For a poem\u2019s \u2018incipit\u2019 as its title, see e.g. E. J. Kenney, \u2018That Incomparable Poem the \u201cIlle\nEgo\u201d\u2019, CR 20 (1970), 290.\n20 Cf. the beginning of another Propertian pentameter (bella canam, \u2018I shall sing wars\u2019, Prop.\n2.10.8); there, after a nod to the idea that Propertius might sing of Augustan battles, the\npromise is revoked as the poet returns to his usual erotic themes; cf. the similarly deceptive\nopening of Ovid, Am. 1.1.1 (where arma is the \u2018incipit\u2019).\n21 Indeed, the Aetia at least touches on the exploits of kings and heroes: e.g. Aetia 1.7.19ff.\n(the Argonauts\u2019 return), 1.22\u20133 (Heracles and the sacrifice at Lindus), 2.44\u20137 (the king\nPhalaris, killed by Heracles), 4.110 (Ptolemy III\u2019s departure for war).\n22 iugo (4.10.4) may increase the sense that Propertius has to work hard physically here. For\nPropertius\u2019 active participation in religion, see perhaps 4.6, where Prop. seems to be literally\npresent at a religious ceremony.\n23 Cf. Prop. 2.10.5\u20136, where Propertius looks forward to singing the praises of Augustus\u2019\nmilitary success; there we find laus (cf. gloria here) connected with uires, and a similar under-\ncutting of the poet\u2019s grand aspirations with the statement that it is enough to have wished to sing\nof such things, which anticipates the recusatio of Propertius\u2019 declared theme that follows.\nA similar sense of bathos can be read into the grand aspirations of\nthe fourth line, where Propertius recalls the pleasure found in novel\npoetic achievement expressed at Lucretius De rerum natura 1.927\u201330:\n[. . . .] iuuat integros accedere fontis\natque haurire, iuuatque nouos decerpere flores\ninsignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam\nunde prius nulli uelarint tempora Musae [. . . .]. (Lucr. 1.927\u201330)\nIt is pleasing to approach virgin springs\nand drain them, and pleasing to pluck new flowers\nand to seek an illustrious crown for my head from there,\nwhence the Muses have never before covered the temples of another [. . . .].\nRevisiting both Lucretius\u2019 language and imagery, Propertius elevates\nhis own elegies by association with Lucretius\u2019 didactic epic.24 On\nfurther consideration, however, the Lucretian parallel might make the\nreader of Propertius\u2019 fourth book pause. Although Propertius \u2018bor-\nrows\u2019 the second Lucretian image of the poet\u2019s pleasure in gaining a\ncrown by his efforts,25 he makes nothing here of Lucretius\u2019 first meta-\nphor for poetry as the draining of virgin springs. However, the\nprevious poem in the collection, 4.9, relates \u2018what Hercules did next\u2019\nafter killing the monster Cacus, an achievement that had previously\nbeen related at length in Aeneid 8. Propertius treats this epic feat of\nheroism with elegiac lightness of touch, revealing that Hercules,\nthirsty after his exertions, broke into the shrine of the Bona Dea, and\ndrained its waters, which were reserved exclusively for the goddess\u2019\nvirgin devotees: at 59ff., the priestess of the Bona Dea unsuccessfully\ntries to warn Hercules away from the spring:\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 67\n24 Propertius perhaps signals the allusion to Lucretius with lecta (4.10.4), which can mean\n\u2018having been read\u2019 as well as \u2018having been picked\u2019. For this pun in Propertius, see e.g. 4.11.14\n(the dead Cornelia says: en sum, quod digitis quinque legatur, onus, \u2018look, I am a burden which can\nbe gathered with five fingers\u2019), where digitis quinque in the pentameter seems to guarantee a refer-\nence to reading poetry. See also e.g. Ovid, Met. 5.394 (Proserpina aequales certat superare legendo,\n\u2018Proserpina strives to beat her equals at picking\u2019), where there may be a self-reflexive reference\nto Ovid surpassing his fellow-poets in his reading, given that this passage alludes to earlier repre-\nsentations of flower-picking in literature.\n25 The allusion to Lucretius 1 is complex: the reference at Prop. 4.10.4 to a poetic corona\nlooks back to 4.1a.61 (Ennius hirsuta cingat sua dicta corona, \u2018Let Ennius surround his words with\na shaggy crown\u2019), which is itself an allusion to an earlier Lucretian reference to Ennius\u2019 poetic\ncrown, Lucr. 1.117\u201318 (Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui primus amoeno \/ detulit ex Helicone perenni\nfronde coronam, \u2018As our Ennius sang, who first from lovely \/ Helicon brought down a crown with\never-lasting foliage\u2019). In addition, Prop.\u2019s reference to gaining a poetic crown and glory from his\ntask seems to assimilate him to those who gain the spolia opima: Polybius 6.54.3\u20134 records how\nyoung Romans are inspired to endure suffering for the sake of glory, even volunteering for single\ncombat with this end in view; lego is found of gaining spoils (examples at TLL 7.2.1124.23ff.);\nand the corona recalls the crown worn by triumphing Roman generals (cf. TLL 4.981.70ff.).\ndi tibi dent alios fontes: haec lympha puellis\nauia secreti limitis unda fluit.\n[. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ]\nat postquam exhausto iam flumine uicerat aestum. (4.9.59\u201360, 63)\nMay the gods grant you other springs: this water\nflows for maidens as a pathless stream of exclusive passage\n[. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ]\nBut after he had conquered the heat with the stream now drained . . . .\nGiven the comically literal treatment meted out in the previous poem\nto Lucretius\u2019 image of poetry as the draining of untouched springs,\nPropertius may hint that his generic aspirations may be less than\nserious here too.\nHowever, when Propertius relates the victories of Romulus, Cossus\nand Marcus Claudius Marcellus, he appears to celebrate Roman mili-\ntary success, and hence the values of epic rather than elegiac poetry.\nIn fact, as I shall demonstrate, Propertius displays squeamishness\nabout relating feats of arms and maintains an ironic detachment from\nthe military values of Augustan Rome. He thereby remains true to his\nprevious guise as a love elegist for whom the slogan \u2018make love not\nwar\u2019 might have been invented.\nAfter the four-line introduction, Propertius relates the victory of\nRome\u2019s founder in the Italian wars. The first occasion on which the\nspolia opima were gained is presented not as a foregone conclusion\nwhich provides a model for later Roman military supremacy;26 it is\nrather a contest between equals:27 Livy leaves the enemy king un-\nnamed in his account of the battle, calling him rex and dux hostium,\nbut in Propertius the name Acron evokes his strength via a pun on the\nGreek (\u2018highest\u2019); Acron, identified here and here alone as\n\u2018Herculeus\u2019,28 has his own semi-divine connections to balance\n68 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n26 Contrast Livy 1.10.4, where Romulus disposes of the men of Caenina leuique certamine\n(\u2018with a light struggle\u2019).\n27 The balance between Roman and enemy generals is already hinted at in Propertius\u2019\nsecond line, where armaque de ducibus trina recepta tribus (\u2018three sets of armour received from\nthree generals\u2019) could refer either to the capture of the weapons from three enemy leaders or\ntheir dedication to Jupiter by three victorious Roman generals, and the parallelism of enemy and\nRoman duces is again stressed at 46, where the Roman dux strikes enemy ducem.\n28 As Clemence Schultze points out, Acron is also metrically equivalent to Anton (the son of\nHercules). This perhaps evokes Mark Antony, the defeated enemy of the second founder of\nRome, who claimed Anton as his ancestor, and stressed his links with Hercules: see e.g. Plut.\nAnt. 4; Zanker (n. 17), 44\u20136; R. A. Gurval, Actium and Augustus. The Politics and Emotions of\nCivil War (Ann Arbor, 1995), 92\u20133; and T. S. Welch, \u2018Masculinity and Monuments in\nPropertius 4.9\u2019, AJPh 125 (2004), 65 (especially n. 15). For links between Propertius and\nAntony, see J. Griffin, \u2018Propertius and Antony\u2019, JRS 67 (1977), 17\u201326.\nRomulus\u2019 future deification, alluded to at line 11;29 Rome has been\nterrorized by Acron;30 and Acron is confident enough in his abilities\nto attack Rome\u2019s gates and hope that he might win spoils from\nRomulus.31 Finally, Romulus\u2019 victory seems to depend upon his pious\nprayer to Jupiter (13\u201316) rather than innate Roman military superi-\nority.32 Again, Propertius\u2019 description of the single combat is hardly\nwhat we would expect of a poem which purports to relate grand epic\narma: it comes in line 16 in the lowly pentameter (uouerat, et spolium\ncorruit ille Ioui,\u2018Romulus had made a vow, and Acron fell as spoil to\nJove\u2019),33 and focuses attention on the defeated rather than the epic\nvictor.34 This battle-description is comparable with Propertius 4.6,\nwhich treats the victory of the future emperor Augustus at the battle\nof Actium, the crucial \u2018first act\u2019 in establishing him as sole ruler of\nRome. Propertius 4.6 describes in detail the layout of the opposing\nfleets lined up for battle, the epiphany of Apollo, Cleopatra\u2019s flight\nfrom Actium, and drunken celebrations of the victory, but the actual\nfighting is confined to a single laughable couplet (Prop. 4.6.55\u20136).\nSimilarly, instead of focusing upon arma in the sense of \u2018feats of\narms\u2019, in lines 20\u20132, Propertius concentrates upon the physical\nappearance of the arma which Romulus carried into battle. This\nrecalls Tarpeia\u2019s erotic focus upon how attractive Tatius looked when\ndressed for war in Propertius 4.4,35 undermining the epic description\nof Romulus\u2019 battle-dress.36\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 69\n29 Propertius alludes to this in line 11, where Romulus is called \u2018Quirinus\u2019, somewhat prem-\naturely. Cf. Ovid, Fast. 4.855, where Romulus\u2019 citizens are anachronistically called \u2018Quirites\u2019\nwhen mourning for Remus (Ovid notes that they are nondum facti [. . . .] Quirites, \u2018Not yet made\ncitizens\u2019).\n30 As it had arguably been by Antony during the civil wars.\n31 The enjambment makes the reversal in Acron\u2019s fortunes appear particularly rapid, but it is\nhardly unexpected: cf. Aen. 10.449ff., where Pallas hopes that he might be able to win spoils\nfrom Turnus, but ends up himself being despoiled by Turnus.\n32 In Livy\u2019s account, Romulus\u2019 martial prowess is much more on display, and Romulus\u2019\naddress to Jupiter is made only after the battle, at the dedication of the spoils (Livy 1.10.7). In\nProp. 4.10, the vow of 15, together with 16, literally provides the first example of the dedication\nof the spolia opima to Jupiter. Propertius here alludes to the Latin offering of the primitiae to\nJupiter, as does Virgil in Aeneid 11.16 when he alludes to the spoils of the dead Mezentius as\nprimitiae. See too Ovid Fast. 4.879\u201396, where Ovid alludes to our poem.\n33 Propertius\u2019 division of his material into epic hexameter and elegiac pentameter plays with\ngeneric convention throughout this poem: the conquering heroes Romulus and Cossus speak,\nfittingly, only in hexameters (15 and 35; note too that Virdomarus\u2019 very epic boasting of his\ndescent occurs in indirect speech in another hexameter, 41).\n34 Cf. very obviously the end of the Aeneid.\n35 4.4.19ff.; cf. too Met. 8.23ff., where Ovid draws upon Propertius 4.4 in his description of\nScylla love-struck by the invading enemy general Minos.\n36 Note particularly the hirsuta plume of his helmet (20); the adjective is frequently utilized\nby the elegists to suggest primitive epic roughness: for which, cf. e.g. Prop. 4.1.61 and Ovid, Tr.\n2.259 (both on Ennius). The description of how Romulus set out to battle at 17\u201322 also seems\nAlthough these lines lack the graphic descriptions of severed necks\nand throats which close the next two sections, Romulus\u2019 victory is\nextremely bloody: at line 12 we read that the spolia which Romulus\ngains from Acron, who had hoped to win spoils himself, are non\nsanguine sicca suo (\u2018soaked with his own blood\u2019). The vocabulary in the\nopening lines of this passage prepares us for the bloodshed to come:\nimbuis in line 5 can mean simply \u2018you set\/ inaugurate\u2019, but can also\nmean \u2018you stain\/ wet\u2019, and is frequently used in this sense of dyeing\nwith blood;37 we might translate plenus, applied to Romulus\u2019 gaining\nof spoil in line 6, as \u2018glutted\u2019; finally, I have translated fundis as \u2018you\nlaid low\u2019 (cf. Livy 1.10.4 in his account of Romulus\u2019 victory), but the\nverb also has strong connotations of pouring, and here alludes to the\nblood poured out in Romulus\u2019 victory.38 The curtailed account here\nof Romulus\u2019 victory, taken together with Propertius\u2019 allusion to the\nbloody nature of hand-to-hand combat, hints at Propertius\u2019 elegiac\ndistaste at bloody warfare; he is far from celebrating epic arma. A\nparallel to this is Prop. 3.3, where, instructing Propertius that he\nshould remain a poet of elegiac love (3.3.47ff.), Calliope tells the poet\nthat he will not go ad arma (\u2018to arms\u2019, 3.3.40), advises\nnil tibi sit rauco praeconia classica cornu\nflare, nec Aonium tingere Marte nemus\nLet it not be your concern to blow the battle-summons on a trumpet,\nnor to stain the grove of Helicon with war. (41\u20132)\n70 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\nto me to evoke Augustus and Augustan ideology: caesi (22) in the description of Romulus\u2019\nsword-belt may allude to Augustus Caesar: for play elsewhere on the name of the Caesars and\ncaedo, see A. Barchiesi, The Poet and the Prince (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1997), 129 (on Fasti\n3.709\u201310) and A. Michalopoulos, Ancient Etymologies in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. A Commented\nLexicon (Leeds, 2001), 46\u20137 (on Met. 15.480 and Am. 2.14.17ff.). Furthermore, the description\nof Romulus enduring the camps a parco [. . .] lare (\u2018from a thrifty household\u2019) recalls the exhor-\ntation at Hor. Carm. 3.2.1ff. for the Augustan youth angustam [. . .] pauperiem pati (\u2018endure\nconstricting poverty\u2019) (1), pass his life in martial pursuits, and be an eques metuendus hasta (\u2018for-\nmidable horseman with a spear\u2019; picked up at Prop. 4.10 by eques, 19, and cuspide, 7).\n37 Cf. e.g. Virgil, Aen. 7.541\u20132 (sanguine bellum \/ imbuit, \u2018gives the first blood of battle\u2019);\nfurther examples at TLL 7.1.427.72ff. As Heyworth\u2019s commentary (n. 1) ad loc. notes, Prop.\nonly activates this sense of imbuo at 12; nevertheless, its close proximity here to palma may\nsuggest that Romulus stained the palms of his hands with Acron\u2019s blood; cf. the focus on the\nkilling hands of Cossus at 37 (di Latias iuuere manus, \u2018the gods aided Roman hands\u2019); however,\nthe dependence of primae [. . .] palmae on exemplum might be a barrier to reading in this way.\n38 Cf. e.g. Virgil, Aen. 2.532 (multo uitam cum sanguine fudit, \u2018he poured out his life with\ncopious gore\u2019); Hor. Epod. 7.3\u20134 (parumne campis atque Neptuno super \/ fusum est Latini sanguinis?,\n\u2018or has too little Roman blood been poured out on the killing fields and at sea?\u2019), and TLL\n6.1.1564.22ff.\nand tells him that he should not be concerned about barbarus [...]\nSuebo perfusus sanguine Rhenus (\u2018the barbarian [. . . .] Rhine soaked\nthrough and through with Suebian blood\u2019, 45).39\nPropertius\u2019 lines on Romulus also reflect badly upon Augustus\u2019\nown military prowess and much-vaunted clemency: Romulus and\nAugustus, the first and second \u2018founders\u2019 of the city,40 are closely\nconnected in the description of Romulus at 17 (urbis uirtutisque parens\nsic uincere sueuit, \u2018so the father of the city and of bravery was accus-\ntomed to win\u2019), evoking Augustus\u2019 own title of pater patriae and claims\nto uirtus.41 The entire line appears rich in possibilities for subversive\nreadings vis-\u00e0-vis Augustus. On the most favourable interpretation of\nthis line, Propertius identifies religious piety as the driving force\nbehind Romulus\u2019 military successes; the positive implications for pius\nAugustus are obvious.42 However, Propertius\u2019 mention of Romulus\u2019\nreliance on religion in gaining his victories may remind the reader\nthat, in contemporary Rome, Augustus is such an indifferent military\ncommander that not only has he failed to win Rome\u2019s highest military\naccolade himself, but he also cites religious reasons for refusing to\nallow anyone else to lay claim to it. Alternatively, perhaps we should\nrefer \u2018so he was accustomed to win\u2019 not to Romulus\u2019 piety, but rather\nthe bloodthirsty nature of his victories. This reading is strengthened\nfor me by the way in which sic echoes line 12\u2019s non sanguine sicca suo,\nan oddly unemphatic way of saying that the spoils were wet with\nAcron\u2019s blood;43 one explanation for the unusual expression might be\nthat it provides a link between lines 12 and 17. Propertius thereby\nmakes an extremely subversive point about the military victories of\nRomulus and Augustus: both the mythical father of Rome and his\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 71\n39 Cf. the opening lines of Lucan 1: at 9, Lucan talks of the civil war providing enemy\nnations with the spectacle of Latium [. . .] cruorem (\u2018Roman [. . .] blood\u2019), line 14 refers to the\nciuiles hauserunt sanguine dextrae (\u2018the right hands of Roman citizens which shed blood\u2019), verses\n38\u20139 suggest that, if this is what it takes for Nero to gain ascendancy diros Pharsalia campos \/\nimpleat et Poeni saturentur sanguine manes (\u2018Let Pharsalia fill her dread plains and let the shades of\nthe Carthaginian be saturated with blood\u2019), and line 95 identifies the primal crime of the\nRomans via the image of bloodshed: fraterno primi maduerunt sanguine muri (\u2018the original walls\nwere wet with the blood of a brother\u2019).\n40 Cf. the statement at Suet. Aug. 7.2 that \u2018Romulus\u2019 was one of the names considered for\nOctavian before \u2018Augustus\u2019 ([. . .] Munati Planci sententia, cum, quibusdam censentibus Romulum\nappellari oportere quasi et ipsum conditorem urbis, praeualuisset, \u2018the suggestion of Munatius\nPlancus, with others agreeing, won the day: he ought to be called Romulus, as if he himself were\nthe founder of the city\u2019).\n41 Cf. esp. Hor. Carm. 3.24.27, where Augustus as the defender of morality is alluded to as\npater urbium, itself an allusion to pater patriae.\n42 For the reader of Livy or Fasti 3, this is an odd image of Romulus: the first founder of\nRome seems much more suited to martial deeds than religious piety.\n43 My translation (\u2018soaked with his own blood\u2019) obscures the oddity of the phrasing (literally\n\u2018but not dry of his own blood\u2019) in its attempt to echo the aural play in the Latin.\ncontemporary counterpart are accustomed to win in a welter of\nblood.\nFurthermore, Propertius may call Romulus\u2019 piety into question by\nalluding in the death of his victim to that of another Acron: the Greek\nwho at Aeneid 10.719ff. falls at the hands of Mezentius. Propertius\ntakes from Virgil the description of the killer seeing his victim fighting\n(hunc [. . .] uidet, \u2018he saw him\u2019, 13, recalls hunc ubi miscentem longe\nmedia agmina uidit, \u2018he saw him from a distance causing havoc in the\nmiddle of the battle line\u2019, Aen. 10.721), and the bloody description of\nthe death of Romulus\u2019 foe mirrors that of Acron in the Aeneid: at\n10.727\u20138, a simile describing the death of Acron relates how the lion\nthat represents Mezentius lauit improba taeter\/44 ora cruor (\u2018washes his\npitiless mouth with foul gore\u2019), and at 10.731, we read of how Acron\ninfractaque tela cruentat (\u2018bloodies the broken weapons\u2019). The similari-\nties between the two episodes are troubling: for Mezentius is of course\nmost famous as the contemptor diuum, who despises the gods; that\nRomulus plays his role here subverts the description of his piety.45\nPropertius moves from legendary time to the far-distant historical\npast, with Cossus\u2019 victory over the Etruscan leader Tolumnius in the\nfifth century BC. The possible implications of insequitur (23) are worth\nexploring. On the most prosaic level, this refers to Cossus \u2018coming\nnext\u2019 after Romulus in the sequence of those who won the spolia\nopima. The verb may also suggest that Cossus comes \u2018hot on the\nheels\u2019 of Romulus in martial exploits, thus bringing to the fore the\ncompetitive element to the winning of these spoils.46 However,\nPhillimore\u2019s tempting conjecture inficitur (\u2018is stained by\u2019) would repeat\nthe emphasis on blood found in 5\u20138, and, together with sanguine lauit\n(38), frame the Cossus passage with allusions to the bloody nature of\nhis victory. This suits a passage which expresses a typically elegiac\ndisdain for warfare. When Propertius expresses regret at the conquest\nof the Etruscan city of Veii in lines 27\u201330, he appears to comment\non the negative effects of Roman imperial dominance on her Italian\nneighbours.\nThis may recall the final poem of his first book, where Propertius\nhad pointedly identified himself as linked with the Etruscan city of\n72 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n44 Propertius picks up on lauit (38).\n45 Propertius chooses to focus on a description of the victor\u2019s dress rather than the victim\u2019s;\ncontrast Aen. 10.722.\n46 In this, it perhaps echoes 5, where primae and palmae evoke competition. For insequitur\nevoking competition in this way, cf. e.g. Virgil, Aen. 5.321 (the context is a foot-race).\nPerusia, which had suffered greatly during the civil wars at the hands\nof the future \u2018princeps\u2019 (I give the poem in full):\nQualis et unde genus, qui sint mihi, Tulle, Penates,\nquaeris pro nostra semper amicitia.\nsi Perusina tibi patriae sunt nota sepulcra,\nItaliae duris funera temporibus,\ncum Romana suos egit discordia ciues \u2013\nsic mihi praecipue, puluis Etrusca, dolor,\ntu proiecta mei perpessa es membra propinqui,\ntu nullo miseri contegis ossa solo \u2013\nproxima suppositos contingens Umbria campos\nme genuit terris fertilis uberibus.

Well,\nI\u2019m from West Yorkshire, just up the road.\u201947 All later Propertian\nreferences to Italian townships, particularly when they are set up in\nopposition to Rome, should surely be read in the light of this provoca-\ntive self-identification with a specifically Italian, anti-war ethos. Here,\nPropertius\u2019 grief at the fate of Veii undermines any admiration at\nRome\u2019s military success.48\nFurthermore, description of combat between Roman and enemy\nleaders is again elided: Cossus\u2019 laconic declaration that war-war is\nbetter than the jaw-jaw which Tolumnius prefers (35)49 is followed by\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 73\n47 See n. 9.\n48 There is a nice play on Virgil\u2019s poetic career in the lines on Veii: 29 evokes the pastoral\nEclogues (pastoris [. . .] lenti in particular looks to Ecl. 1.4, where the shepherd Tityrus is lentus in\numbra; cantat, 30, evokes the singing of the Ecl.), 30 alludes to G. 1.493ff. (ploughing over\nbattlefields), and the material on the warlike nature of the ancient Veii evokes the militaristic\nAen.\n49 See S. P. Oakley, \u2018Single Combat in the Roman Republic\u2019, CQ 35.2 (1985), 397, for the\nway in which Prop. 4.10 presents the fight between Cossus and Tolumnius as a formal duel.\nNote how it is the enemy leaders who are overconfident in the other two vignettes (Acron hopes\na description of the leaders taking up their battle positions on the\nplain,50 but we are told merely that the gods aided Latin hands (a\nreference to the hand-to-hand nature of the fighting that leads to the\ndedication of the spolia opima) before Propertius \u2018cuts\u2019 to the final and\nvery bloody act of the battle (desecta Tolumni\/ ceruix Romanos sanguine\nlauit equos, \u2018Tolumnius\u2019 severed\/ neck bathed the Roman horses in\nblood\u2019, 37\u20138).\nPropertius provides the shortest account of Marcus Claudius\nMarcellus\u2019 defeat of the Gaul Vir(i)domarus\/ Britomarus in 222 BC.\nThere is play here with a famous passage at the conclusion of Aeneid\n6, where Aeneas in the underworld is shown his future illustrious\ndescendants, among whom is the third winner of the spolia opima,\ndescribed thus by Anchises:\n\u2018aspice, ut insignis spoliis Marcellus opimis\ningreditur uictorque uiros supereminet omnis.51\nhic rem Romanam magno turbante tumultu\nsistet eques,52 sternet Poenos Gallumque rebellem,53\ntertiaque arma patri suspendet capta Quirino.\u201954 (Virgil, Aen. 6.855\u20139)\nLook how Marcellus, distinguished by the spolia opima,\nproceeds and, victorious, towers over all men.\nHe will hold fast the Roman state while a great uprising disturbs it,\non horseback, he will lay low the Carthaginians and rebellious Gaul,\nand will hang up the third set of captured arms for father Romulus.\nAccompanying this paragon of Roman military success is his young\nnamesake and descendant, Augustus\u2019 nephew and son-in-law, the\nfamous miserande puer who died aged nineteen in 23 BC, after his\n74 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\nto win spoils from Romulus, 11, and Virdomarus boasts descent from Brennus, 41); Cossus\nappears the more confident here, as he issues a challenge to Tolumnius. For Roman sources\npresenting enemy commanders as arrogant and over-confident, cf. Oakley, 408.\n50 Propertius seems to set this up as battle between the epic Cossus and the elegiac\nTolumnius, who relies on cunning rather than military prowess and prefers speech to military\naction (32).\n51 Propertius has transferred uictor as a description of the dedicator of the spolia opima from\nClaudius to Romulus (8).\n52 The Romulus and Cossus episodes in Prop. 4.10 both focus on Roman horsemanship (cf.\n19 and 37); conversely, Propertius focuses on the enemy leader\u2019s skill with the chariot in the\nMarcellus episode (42). This may be in reaction to Virgil\u2019s description of Marcellus as eques\nhere.\n53 Prop. 4.10.39 (Claudius at Rheno traiectos arcuit hostes, \u2018Next Claudius repulsed the enemy\nwho had crossed the Rhine\u2019) is the closest Propertius gets to mentioning that Marcellus\u2019 prize\nwas gained during a Gallic rebellion.\n54 For the unexpected dedication to Quirinus rather than Jupiter Feretrius, cf. Harrison\n(n. 5), 413. Propertius avoids the issue by omitting all mention of the dedication of the spoils\ntaken by Marcellus, and 45\u20138 seem to settle the matter.\nadoption as Augustus\u2019 heir. Augustus\u2019 high hopes for the youth are\nreflected in the promise made to him at Aeneid 6.882\u20133 that, if he\nsomehow manages to avoid his fated early death, he will be another\nMarcellus; that is, achieve exploits comparable with those of his illus-\ntrious predecessor.\nPropertius\u2019 description of Virdomarus as uasti . . . duci (40) recalls\nAnchises\u2019 claim at Aeneid 6.856 that Marcus Claudius Marcellus\ntowered over all men. Propertius\u2019 uastus may increase the general\u2019s\nstature, since he towered over even those who are described as huge,\nor may rather correct Anchises\u2019 testimony:55 Marcus Claudius\nMarcellus was indeed a giant among men, but Virgil\u2019s omnis is\nexposed as an exaggeration, since the Roman had opponents who\nwere physically even more impressive than him. When at 4.10.41,\nPropertius records Virdomarus\u2019 claim about his successful ancestor,\nthe chieftain Brennus who had captured Rome in 390 BC, the reader\nmight think of another man who attempts to gain for himself some of\nthe glory of those to whom he is related: that is, Augustus himself,\nwho perhaps hoped to gain reflected glory from Marcus Claudius\nMarcellus via his relationship with the young Marcellus.\nThe Claudius passage ends abruptly and with concentration upon\nbloodshed, like the Cossus passage before it, with no description of\nthe fight itself, but what appears to be an allusion to the actual spoils\ntaken from Virdomarus, as his torque presumably falls to Marcellus as\nbooty at 4.10.43\u20134 (illi [i.e. Marcellus, answering hic of Virdomarus at\n41] uirgatas maculanti sanguine bracas \/ torquis ab incisa decidit unca\ngula, \u2018To Claudius as Virdomarus stained his striped trousers with\nblood \/ the hook-ended necklace fell down from the cut throat\u2019).56\nPropertius then moves quickly to the aftermath of military victory:\nby line 45, the spoils are laid up in Jupiter Feretrius\u2019 temple, cleansed\nof disturbing associations with bloody slaughter by their new status as\nreligious artefacts. Propertius perhaps recognizes his own role in sani-\ntizing the spolia opima when he refers to them as condita (45): on the\nmost literal level, these spoils are \u2018set (or laid) up\u2019 in a temple, but the\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 75\n55 Anchises may be biased, since Marcellus the younger will be related to him by marriage.\nIn addition, the description of the Gaul as uastus may play upon a Roman sense of inferiority\nabout their short statures relative to Gauls and Celts: see Oakley (n. 49), 407 n. 133.\n56 The details of the torque and blood seem to owe a debt to the third-century BC statue of\nthe Dying Gaul (a Roman copy of which can be found in the Capitoline museum), which\ndepicts a Gaul laid low, wearing a torque, and with a visible wound in his side. Propertius\u2019 focus\non the barbarian and exotic torque may also owe something to the portrayal of Marcellus at\nPlut. Marc. 6.6 as having vowed the finest armour on the field to Jupiter before battle: cf. Flower\n(n. 7), 37.\nverb frequently has connotations of literary \u2018composition\u2019:57 famously,\nfor example, at the beginning and end of the Aeneid, where the use of\nthe verb to describe Aeneas\u2019 foundation of the city and burying of the\nsword in Turnus can also be applied meta-poetically to Virgil\u2019s own\nachievement in composing the poem.58 In this poem, then, Propertius\nhas transformed the spolia opima from gore-soaked tokens of military\ndestruction into a poetic creation in a poem which celebrates begin-\nnings rather than endings and elegiac values over epic ones.\nThe end of the poem returns to its beginning: causa Feretri (45)\nrecalls the opening line\u2019s causas [. . .] Feretri. We now realize that\ncausas (1) was a genuine plural, since Propertius offers two alternative\nexplanations for the name. It is significant that the poem ends on a\nnote of doubt as to whether \u2018Feretrius\u2019 is derived from ferire, \u2018to\nstrike\u2019, or ferre, \u2018to carry\u2019 (46\u20137). Although alternative explanations\nare characteristic of aetiological poems, such as Callimachus\u2019 Aetia, or\nOvid\u2019s Fasti,59 the alternative explanations at the end of this poem\nseem to involve more than a scholarly debate about etymology.\nRather, Propertius stresses that the origins of Jupiter Feretrius\u2019 name\n\u2013 and hence perhaps the award of the spolia opima \u2013 are open to\ndebate.60\nA brief analysis of the structure of the poem lends support to this\nreading. The four-line opening and concluding sections, which deal\nwith causas and proud achievement, balance each other. The passages\nwhich deal with the military exploits of Roman heroes are presented\nchronologically. However, we might expect Propertius to devote more\ntime and space to the most recent events, about which more informa-\ntion will have been available. However, the reverse is the case: the\ncloser Propertius gets to his own day, the less he relates about the\n76 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n57 With this meta-literary play four lines from the end of the poem, cf. the potential literary\nplay in lecta, four lines in.\n58 Aen. 1.5 and 12.950. For condere in a literary sense, cf. e.g. Prop. 2.1.14 (tum uero longas\ncondimus Iliadas, \u2018then indeed I compose long Iliads\u2019); Virgil, Ecl. 6.7 (tristia condere bella, \u2018to\ncompose grim wars\u2019); Hor. Epist. 1.3.24 (condis [. . . .] carmen, \u2018you compose a song\u2019); Ovid, Tr.\n2.335\u20136 (immania Caesaris acta \/ condere, \u2018to compose the outsized deeds of Augustus\u2019) and TLL\n4.153.74ff.\n59 Cf. e.g. Callimachus, Aet. 1.6 Pfeiffer or Ovid, Fast. 4.61\u20132 and 85ff.\n60 Compare the last four lines of 4.9, which also explicitly treat etymology: in this case,\nHercules\u2019 Sabine name and cult title of \u2018Sancus\u2019 (\u2018Sanctifier\u2019). There is room for doubt in the\nexplanation of how Hercules gained this title: Prop. 4.9.73\u201374 claims that Hercules gained this\ntitle quoniam manibus purgatum sanxerat orbem (\u2018since he had sanctified the world with his\nhands\u2019), but the immediately preceding narrative hardly shows him in this heroic light, but\nrather as having destroyed the shrine of the Bona Dea. The misapplication of the title of\n\u2018Sancus\u2019 perhaps evokes the Greek version of the title \u2018Augustus\u2019 ( ), casting into some\ndoubt Augustus\u2019 claims to piety and to have purified the world: cf. Heyworth\u2019s (n. 1) suggestive\ncomment ad loc.\nwinning of the spolia opima: the mythical figure Romulus gets the\nlion\u2019s share of the poem, eighteen lines; Cossus receives sixteen;61 and\nMarcus Claudius Marcellus is allotted only six lines.62 What signifi-\ncance should we attribute to Propertius\u2019 unusual focus of attention?\nOn one level, Propertius plays up his antiquarian credentials by giving\nmore attention to events dignified by a long pedigree. However, the\nstructure of Propertius 4.10 also seems to carry a political punch: as\ntime goes on, it becomes less and less possible to talk about the spolia\nopima, until we reach Propertius\u2019 own day, and it is no longer possible\nto talk openly on this subject, for fear of offending the princeps who is\nkeen that the only winner of military glory in present-day Rome will\nbe himself,63 and who had associated the spolia opima with himself by\ngiving them prominence in his Forum.64 This is perhaps reflected in\nplay between aperire (\u2018reveal\u2019, 1) and condita (\u2018buried\u2019, 45): Propertius\npromises that he is going to reveal the origins of the name, but the\nspolia opima must be buried in a temple and an ostensibly fusty anti-\nquarian debate in order to avoid giving offence to the emperor;\nPropertius is not going to reveal a fourth possible claimant to the\nprize, as this might offend Rome\u2019s own Jupiter. Silence \u2013 or, more\naccurately, the end of speech \u2013 is also a concern in the opening two\nwords of the poem which follows next in the collection, and concludes\nthe Propertian corpus: Desine, Paulle (\u2018Pause, Paullus\u2019, 4.11.1; compare\nPaullus with the Greek \u2018 \u2019, \u2018I cease\u2019).65 By gradually saying less\nand less in 4.10 as he approaches the topic of arma and spoils in the\nAugustan age, and then falling silent forever as a poet after his next\npoem, which explicitly deals with Augustus and his house, Propertius\nperhaps signals his overarching distaste for Augustan Rome and its\nvalues, about which he refuses to sing further.\nA similar retreat into silence is arguably detectable towards the end\nof the Aeneid, another poem of similar date which Harrison (n. 5),\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 77\n61 Fourteen if we follow Heyworth\u2019s suggestion (n. 1) to delete 25\u20136.\n62 Cf. Janan (n. 4), 197 n. 13, who notes the poem\u2019s \u2018terseness: the shortest poem in Book 4,\nit narrates each winning of the spolia opima more laconically than the last, a compression espe-\ncially noticeable in the third episode.\u2019 This contributes to her interpretation of the poem as\nsubverting its apparent \u2018masculinist poetics\u2019 (loc. cit.).\n63 Cf. Cass. Dio 53.19.3\u20134 on the change that took place in public affairs in Rome in 27 BC,\nand the consequent silence and concealment: cf. especially 3:\n[. . . .], \u2018from that time indeed most\nthings started to be done secretly and without being voiced\u2019.\n64 Note that Iouis is juxtaposed with superba, which can of course carry negative connota-\ntions.\n65 For this play, see Heyworth (n. 1) ad loc.\n413, reads as supporting the Augustan line on the spolia opima, point-\ning to tertia [. . . .] arma in the description of Marcus Claudius\nMarcellus (Aen. 6.859; see above) as a denial of Marcus Licinius\nCrassus\u2019 claim to the honour. Harrison notes that Virgil anachronisti-\ncally introduces the possibility of gaining the spolia opima into the\nheroic action of the Aeneid at 10.449\u201350, where the young Arcadian\nprince Pallas hopes that he might be able to aspire to this prize by\ndefeating Turnus:66\n\u2018aut spoliis ego iam raptis laudabor opimis\naut leto insigni [. . . .]\u2019. (Virgil, Aen. 10.449\u201350)\n\u2018Either I shall be praised for the spolia opima now snatched\nor for a distinguished death [. . . .].\u2019\nHarrison (p. 413), interprets this anachronism, in combination with a\nreference to Pallas leading troops to war suo [. . . .] nomine (\u2018under his\nown name\u2019, Aen. 8.519), as bolstering Augustus\u2019 position that only\nthose who make war under their own auspices are eligible for the\nhonour of the spolia opima. I see these lines operating in a rather\ndifferent way: by mention of Pallas\u2019 opportunity either to win or \u2013\nmore implicitly \u2013 surrender the spolia opima, Virgil directs our atten-\ntion to the closing of the Aeneid.67 There, Aeneas kills Turnus,\nspurred on when he catches sight of Turnus arrayed in the spoils\nwhich he has won from Pallas:\net iam iamque magis cunctantem flectere sermo\ncoeperat, infelix umero cum apparuit alto\nbalteus et notis fulserunt cingula bullis\nPallantis pueri, uictum quem uulnere Turnus\nstrauerat atque umeris inimicum insigne gerebat. (Virgil, Aen. 12.940\u20134)\nAnd now more and more Turnus had begun to bend the hesitant Aeneas\nwith his words, when there appeared high on Turnus\u2019 shoulder the fatal\nsword-belt and there gleamed the baldric, with its familiar studs,\nof the boy Pallas, whom, in his defeat, Turnus with a wound\nhad laid low and now was sporting his hostile insignia on his shoulders.\n78 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\n66 Cf. with this the vain hope of Acron \u2013 who, like Pallas, has connections with Hercules \u2013\nthat he might despoil the enemy commander (Prop. 4.10.11). Those with a shaky grasp of\nRoman history should nevertheless be able to guess that Acron will end up being despoiled\nhimself, given Pallas\u2019 fate in the Aeneid.\n67 Cf. Flower (n. 7), 54\u20135, especially \u2018The final climax of the poem when Aeneas kills\nTurnus ... is a feat clearly synonymous with spolia opima\u2019 (55).\nThe reference here to the spoils that Turnus has stripped from Pallas\nshould remind readers that Pallas had hoped to gain the spolia opima\nin combat with Turnus, and alert us to the fact that there is another \u2013\nadmittedly mythical \u2013 claimant to the spolia opima: Aeneas himself,\nwho as commander-in-chief of the future Roman forces, goes on to\ndefeat his counterpart in single combat. However, just as Propertius\ncannot talk about Augustus and the spolia opima in 4.10, so too Virgil\nis reluctant to talk about Augustus\u2019 ancestor earning the right to the\nhighest Roman military prize: the Aeneid famously ends with a focus\non the vanquished Turnus, rather than Aeneas stripping the enemy\ncommander.68 That Virgil omits a description of Aeneas gaining the\nspolia opima should come as no surprise to the reader who has picked\nup on various hints throughout this final book of the Aeneid that Virgil\nis not keen to continue with his task of writing about Augustus\u2019\nancestor.69 I suggest that Propertius 4.10 picks up on and develops\nthese hints, reading the end of the Aeneid as a pointed retreat into\nsilence in preference to celebrating the new Augustan age.\nA single passage towards the end of the book should be enough to\nencapsulate Virgil\u2019s reluctance to finish his epic record of Aeneas\u2019\nproto-Augustan military success. In single combat with Aeneas,\nTurnus attempts at lines 896\u2013914 to throw a huge rock at his\nenemy.70 The opening of the passage stresses the difficulty of this\nwearisome task:\nuix illum lecti bis sex ceruice subirent,\nqualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus. (Virgil, Aen. 12.899\u2013900)\nScarcely could twice six picked men support the rock on their necks,\ngiven the type of physique of the men whom earth now breeds.\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 79\n68 Contrast the defeat of Mezentius \u2013 another feat whereby Aeneas could have gained the\nspolia opima \u2013 where Aeneas does dedicate his rival\u2019s arms: 11.5ff. (note especially the focus on\nthe blood dripping from the spoils at 8, and the statement at 15\u201316: haec sunt spolia et de rege\nsuperbo \/ primitiae manibusque meis Mezentius hic est, \u2018these are the spoils and the first fruits won\nby my hands, and this is Mezentius\u2019; the underlined words suggest that Virgil presents this as an\ninstance of single combat leading to the dedication of what are potentially spolia opima).\n69 For Augustus prodding Virgil\u2019s work on the Aeneid, see e.g. Donatus, Vita Vergili 31:\nAugustus uero \u2013 nam forte expeditione Cantabrica aberat \u2013 supplicibus atque etiam minacibus per iocum\nlitteris efflagitabat, ut sibi de Aeneide, ut ipsius uerba sunt, uel prima carminis uel quodlibet\nmitteretur, \u2018Augustus indeed \u2013 for by chance he was away on campaign in Cantabria \u2013\nwith prayers and even joking threats harassed him in a letter, [telling him] that there should be\nsent to him from the Aeneid, to put it in Augustus\u2019 own words, either the preliminary sketch of\nthe poem or any portion.\u2019\n70 The rock is antiquum ingens (\u2018massive and ancient\u2019, 12.897), both of which seem to carry\nmeta-poetic generic force here.\nAt first glance, this perhaps reads as the sort of remark bolstering\nthe elevated status of heroes which is typically epic: compare, for\nexample, Iliad 12.445ff., where Hector effortlessly performs feats with\na rock which two of the best men from a contemporary would\nhave had difficulty even in lifting, or the rock hoisted by Diomedes\nwhich two contemporary men could not lift at Iliad 5.302ff. However,\nthe number twelve seems pointed, given that we are reading the twelfth\nbook of the Aeneid; lecti (\u2018picked\u2019, but also \u2018read\u2019; see earlier) and\ncorpora (the \u2018physiques\u2019 of the men, but also the \u2018body\u2019 of work that\ncomprises the Aeneid) also seem to hint at literary play. There is\nadded point, then, to Virgil\u2019s description of the task; perhaps Turnus\u2019\ndifficulty in hoisting the rock aloft mirrors Virgil\u2019s own exhaustion at\nreading and writing twelve books of a huge epic, and hints that the\npoet, like Turnus, may not be able to complete the task he has begun.\nFurther indications of Virgil\u2019s poetic stalling or refusal of his epic task\nseem to occur in the simile that expresses Turnus\u2019 inability to hurl this\nrock, caused by the intervention of the Dira sent by Jupiter in order to\npersuade Turnus\u2019 divine sister to give up her fruitless support of her\nbrother:\nac uelut in somnis, oculos ubi languida pressit\nnocte quies, nequiquam auidos extendere cursus\nuelle uidemur et in mediis conatibus aegri\nsuccidimus; non lingua ualet, non corpore notae\nsufficiunt uires nec uox aut uerba sequuntur:\nsic Turno, quacumque uiam uirtute petiuit,\nsuccessum dea dira negat [. . . .]. (Virgil, Aen. 12.908\u201314)\nAnd just as in dreams, when sluggish sleep oppresses our eyes\nwith night, and in vain we seem to want to press forward eagerly\nin our running, yet, in the midst of our efforts, faint,\nwe fall down; the tongue has no strength, our familiar powers\nfail our body and neither voice nor words follow on:\nso to Turnus, whatever courageous efforts he made to find a path,\nthe dread goddess denied successful outcome.\nThis recalls the simile at Iliad 22.199\u2013201 which describes the stale-\nmate reached in Achilles\u2019 pursuit of Hector, and Lucretius\u2019 account of\ndream-movement at De rerum natura 4.453\u20136; however, the focus here\nupon speech is unusual and unparalleled in Virgil\u2019s models. Turnus\u2019\nfailed attempts at action have an exact point of reference within the\nsimile: the dreamers\u2019 failed attempts to run (lines 909\u201311) are picked\nup by Turnus\u2019 doomed search for a path. When Virgil moves from the\n80 PROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID\ncomparison with running in dreams, it is unexpected, to say the least,\nto read of the failure of language, given that what Turnus is trying\nto do is act rather than speak.71 Yet in lines 911\u201312 only non corpore\nnotae \/ sufficiunt uires concerns physical efforts, whereas non lingua\nualet and nec uox aut uerba sequuntur stress speech and language. In\naddition, corpore appears to lend itself to a meta-poetic reading: that\nthe strength of Virgil\u2019s poetic corpus abandons him at this point. It is\ntempting, then, to read these lines as a plea from Virgil to Augustus,\nthe avid reader of the Aeneid who has been pressing him for further\ncopy (see n. 69), that the poet is running out of puff, and finds him-\nself unable to voice the sort of celebratory statements that are\nrequired in an epic concerned with Augustus\u2019 illustrious antecedents.\nThis, I would argue, provides a good parallel with the close of\nPropertius 4, and offers a very different reading from Harrison\u2019s of\nhow the poets engage with Augustus and the issue of the spolia opima.\nPROPERTIUS 4.10 AND THE END OF THE AENEID 81\n71 Horace perhaps picks up on Virgil\u2019s connection of futile running in dreams with the failure\nof language at the close of Carm. 4.1, where Horace, in love with Ligurinus, reports that he is\nstricken with verbal paralysis (cur facunda parum decoro \/ inter uerba cadit lingua silentio?, \u2018Why\ndoes my eloquent tongue fall into disgraceful silence in mid-flow?\u2019, Carm. 4.1.35\u20136), before\nrelating his futile erotic pursuit of Ligurinus in dreams (37\u201340).\n"}
