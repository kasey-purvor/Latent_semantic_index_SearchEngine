W. Wolff\n(ewwo@bas.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nIce cores provide chronologically-ordered profiles of the\nconcentrations of chemicals deposited from the atmosphere\nand preserved in the ice. Once these concentrations have\nbeen measured, the main challenge is to interpret them in\nterms of a desired environmental unknown. For aerosol com-\nponents such as sea salt and terrestrial dust, interpretations\nin terms of specific sources are available, even if not fully\nverified (Wolff et al., 2006). However, there are additional\ncomplications for other components, especially those that\ninclude multiple production and loss pathways, and a gas-\nphase chemistry.\nIt is relatively simple to analyse nitrate in melted snow\nand ice, and numerous datasets of nitrate variability along ice\ncores exist (Fischer et al., 1998; Herron, 1982; Legrand et al.,\n1988; Mayewski et al., 1990). However, the interpretation of\nthese datasets has proved extremely complicated (Legrand et\nal., 1999; Ro\u00a8thlisberger et al., 2000; Wolff, 1995). There are\ntwo major reasons for this: firstly, it has proven difficult to\nclearly determine the main controls on the concentrations of\noxidised nitrogen in the polar lower troposphere (Savarino\net al., 2007; Wagenbach et al., 1998). There are proba-\nbly significant contributions from the stratosphere, as well\nas from lower latitudes, and recycling of material from cen-\ntral Antarctica to the coast adds complexity. Secondly, the\nconversions between different oxidised nitrogen chemicals\nin the polar atmosphere are complex (Jones et al., 2007), and\nthe processes leading to and after deposition of nitrate itself\nhave a strong effect on the concentrations actually recorded\nin the ice (e.g. Ro\u00a8thlisberger et al., 2000).\nIn some cases, attempts have been made to relate changes\nin concentration to different environmental parameters. For\nexample (Mayewski et al., 1990), the increase over re-\ncent decades in nitrate concentration in Greenland snow has\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n5628 E. W. Wolff et al.: Nitrate in polar ice\nbeen attributed to increasing industrial emissions of NOx\n(NOx=NO+NO2). Given that other factors that might con-\ntrol deposition and preservation of nitrate have probably not\naltered over recent decades in a way that could explain the\nincrease, this conclusion is robust. Over longer timescales,\ndifferent authors have attempted to relate measured nitrate\nconcentration profiles to factors such as aspects of solar ac-\ntivity (McCracken et al., 2001; Zeller and Dreschhoff, 1995;\nZeller et al., 1986), or to changes in stratospheric processes\n(McElroy, 1989; Mulvaney and Wolff, 1993), but there is no\nconsensus about their success.\nIn a very general sense, what one might hope to derive\nfrom ice core nitrate is information about past changes in the\nglobal NOx environment. However, more realistically, what\nmight be expected is a measure of the input of NOy (the sum\nof all oxidised forms of nitrogen) to the polar atmosphere,\nwhether through transport or in-situ production. Changes in\nthe production rate itself would be indicative of changing in-\nfluences on the source strength: for example, NOy produc-\ntion in the middle and upper atmosphere through dissocia-\ntion of O2 and N2 by solar and geomagnetic charged particles\nshould be modulated by solar activity. New NOy production\ndoes not generally occur in the snowpack, although NOy can\nbe recycled between the snowpack and the atmosphere. In\nthe absence of significant surface sources, production occurs\nmainly at higher altitudes (upper troposphere and above), or\n(as in the case of pollution NOx) at lower latitudes. The con-\ncentrations present in the Antarctic lower troposphere there-\nfore depend not only on production but also on the strength\nof lateral and vertical transport. At an individual atmospheric\nmeasurement site, the concentrations of nitrate depend ad-\nditionally on the speciation and spatial distribution of NOy,\nand what is seen in ice cores depends additionally on the de-\nposition of nitrate to the snow and its subsequent preserva-\ntion. The crucial question for the interpretation of ice cores\nis: which of these factors dominates in causing variability (at\ndifferent time and space scales) and trends in ice core nitrate\nconcentrations at each different ice core site?\nMuch effort in recent years has been applied to under-\nstanding the details of changes over short time periods (hours\nto weeks) in snowpack concentrations of nitrate (Mulvaney et\nal., 1998), and in concentrations of NOx in the lowest levels\nof the polar atmosphere (Grannas et al., 2007; Honrath et al.,\n1999; Jones et al., 2000). In this paper, we will start from\nthe new CHABLIS (Chemistry of the Antarctic Boundary\nLayer and the Interface with Snow) measurements at Halley\n(Antarctica), in order to discuss what controls nitrate depo-\nsition on shorter (day to seasonal) timescales, and therefore\nto assess whether short-lived events can be diagnosed from\nthe ice core record. We will then consider other recent data,\nin order to determine what information measurements of ni-\ntrate in ice cores at single sites are capable of delivering. Fi-\nnally, we will take a very broad view to assess strategies by\nwhich past large-scale changes in NOy production might be\nassessed.\n2 Observations at Halley\nThe new observations relevant to this study made at Halley in\nthe CHABLIS (Chemistry of the Antarctic Boundary Layer\nand the Interface with Snow) campaign consist of aerosol ni-\ntrate, gas phase nitric acid, and surface snow nitrate measure-\nments made between February or March 2004, and February\n2005 (Jones et al., 2007). Aerosol filters were collected typ-\nically weekly (but occasionally daily or 6-hourly), and anal-\nysed for a range of anions and cations, including nitrate and\nsodium. Annular denuders were used on the same intervals,\nand analysed for gas-phase nitric acid. Surface snow samples\nwere collected daily (with some exceptions), and analysed\nfor the same range of anions and cations as the aerosol filters\n(Jones et al., 2008).\n3 Nitrate deposition on short (sub-seasonal) timescales\nSharp spikes in nitrate concentration have been observed in\nice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica (McCracken\net al., 2001; Palmer et al., 2001; Zeller and Dreschhoff,\n1995). It has been proposed that such spikes in nitrate con-\ncentration in ice cores may be recording the occurrence of\nshort-lived solar proton events (SPEs) (e.g. McCracken et\nal., 2001; Zeller and Dreschhoff, 1995). The peaks in ni-\ntrate concentration shown in these studies typically exhibit\nconcentrations up to a factor 4 higher than the surrounding\nbackground, and appear to represent often less than 10% of\nthe annual snow accumulation, and thus probably correspond\nto a single snowfall (McCracken et al., 2001). Although the\nidentification of such spikes with SPEs has been strenuously\nrebutted in the ice core and atmospheric chemistry literature\n(e.g. Legrand and Kirchner, 1990), recent papers still argue\nfor it (McCracken et al., 2001) and are widely quoted in\nthe solar-terrestrial community. In this section, we examine\nwhether such spikes can have causes other than sharp pro-\nduction events such as SPEs and, conversely, whether such\nspikes are consistent with the signal expected for SPEs.\n3.1 Short-term variations in concentration of nitrate in Hal-\nley snow\nNitrate concentrations in surface snow at Halley show strong\nshort-term variability during the CHABLIS year. Whilst we\nhave no information on how much of this variability is pre-\nserved in the ice core record, the data (Fig. 1) show nu-\nmerous events that appear analogous to those reported else-\nwhere, and which have sometimes been ascribed to SPEs.\nIn particular, concentrations sometimes increased by a fac-\ntor 2 or more from day to day. In Fig. 1, we have marked\nthe two largest SPEs of the period (peaks occurring on 26\nJuly 2004 and 17 January 2005). We note that these have no\nspecial relationship to the spikes in the nitrate record, with\nmany more spikes than SPEs. The maximum proton fluxes\nof these two SPEs are an order of magnitude less than that\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 8, 5627\u20135634, 2008 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/8\/5627\/2008\/\nE. W.

Nitrate concentrations measured in surface snow samples\ncollected approximately daily at Halley, Antarctica, in 2004 and\nearly 2005. Month markers and grid lines refer to the start of the\nrespective months. The timing of the maximum of the two largest\nSPE\u2019s of the period (proton flux at >10 MeV more than 1000 pfu,\nbased on NOAA Space Environment Center listing) is shown as ar-\nrows.\nof the two largest SPEs recorded in the last 30 years (based\non data supplied by NOAA Space Environment Center at\nhttp:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/ftpdir\/indices\/SPE.txt).\nFor summer 2004\u20132005, we observe that many of the\nlargest spikes in surface snow nitrate concentration are ac-\ncompanied by increased concentrations of other ions, and in\nparticular by high concentrations of sea salt ions (Fig. 2).\nThis applies, for example, to the spikes seen at day 386 and\nday 369 (note though that two surface snow samples were\ntaken on day 369 at nearby positions, and only one of them\nhas high concentrations, implying heterogeneity in snow de-\nposition). On both of these days, the meteorological records\nshow that fresh snow fell. We therefore have a scenario in\nwhich a fresh snowfall occurred, laden with both high sea\nsalt concentrations and high nitrate. In the two cases picked\nout here, the high concentrations were seen only for one day,\nimplying that the snow was either removed by wind, or cov-\nered by cleaner snow. However, it is clear that either of these\nevents, if preserved, could have shown up in an ice core as an\nevent that resembled the sharp peaks previously described.\nThere is also one prominent peak in snow concentration of\nnitrate observed in winter 2004. This has already been noted\n(Jones et al., 2007): on 15 August the surface snow con-\ncentration of nitrate increased to around 200\u00b5g kg\u22121, many\ntimes higher than the concentrations during the rest of the\nspring-winter-autumn period. The increase was clearly the\nresult of a new snowfall, and the concentrations remained\nhigh until another snowfall on 28 August. The high concen-\ntrations in surface snow appear to have been associated with\na fresh snowfall during a period with relatively high con-\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nJAN 1st JAN 11th JAN 21st FEB 1st\n360 370 380 390 400\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\nNa\nNO3\n -\nDate (2005)\nS\nn o\nw\n N\nO\n3 -  \n\/  \u03bc\ng  \nk g\n- 1\nN\na  \n\/  \u03bc\ng  \nk g\n- 1\nDay of year (referred to 1st Jan 2004)\nFig. 2.

This episode probably contributed a signifi-\ncant proportion of the total nitrate deposition to snow in the\nwinter season. An increase in sea salt concentration in snow\nwas associated with this event, but the sea salt concentrations\nare not unusual compared to many other times of the winter\nwhen no nitrate enhancement is apparent in the snow. We\ncan therefore only surmise that this event is associated with\nan enhancement of partitioning of nitrate to aerosol, without\ndefinitely attributing a cause.\n3.2 Sea salt and nitrate aerosol\nIn the CHABLIS campaign at Halley, it was found that the\nseasonality of nitrate concentrations in surface snow was\nsimilar to that of inorganic nitrate and not organic nitrate\n(Jones et al., 2007). This suggests that, although organic ni-\ntrate has higher concentrations than inorganic for much of\nthe year, it probably has a very long lifetime against deposi-\ntion to snow, and plays little role in determining snow con-\ncentrations. We therefore feel reasonably confident in con-\ncentrating on inorganic nitrate in air (HNO3 in gas phase,\nplus aerosol nitrate) and snow to assess the short-term depo-\nsitional processes.\nHigh concentrations of sea salt aerosol are expected to pro-\nmote conversion of gas-phase nitrate to aerosol nitrate, as\nwell as trapping of gas-phase nitrate on salty snow surfaces.\nIt has previously been shown (Jourdain and Legrand, 2002;\nRankin and Wolff, 2003; Teinila et al., 2000) using size-\nsegregated aerosol collection, that aerosol nitrate is found in\nthe same size range as sea salt aerosol, and this supports the\nconclusion that sea salt (as well as terrestrial dust, but this is\na small component at coastal sites in the present day) is re-\nsponsible for converting nitric acid to aerosol.

Nitrate and sodium concentrations measured on aerosol fil-\nters collected at Halley, Antarctica, in 2004 and early 2005. Month\nmarkers and grid lines refer to the start of the respective months.\nthat there is a general tendency for short-term enhancements\nof concentrations of aerosol nitrate to be associated with sim-\nilar enhancements of sea salt. The typical ratio of aerosol ni-\ntrate to Na is lower during the winter months when total ni-\ntrate (aerosol+gas\u2212phase) is low, so that a single correlation\ncovering the whole year cannot be made, but the relation-\nship is present in both summer and winter. We therefore sug-\ngest that increased aerosol sea salt concentrations are tend-\ning to partition nitrate towards the aerosol phase. It is diffi-\ncult to test this directly and quantitatively by estimating the\naerosol\/gas-phase ratio for two reasons: firstly, the gas phase\nHNO3 concentrations are not available at similar resolution,\nbecause the data above the detection limit are rather sparse;\nand secondly, the conversion towards the aerosol phase could\nbe taking place at higher levels in the atmosphere not sam-\npled by our experiments. During a snowfall it is certainly the\nconcentrations at higher levels (up to that of the cloud) that\nare important.\nWe therefore note that the presence of sea salt promotes\nthe conversion of gas phase nitrate to the aerosol phase,\nallowing an efficient deposition of nitrate through aerosol\nmechanisms. Highly saline (or dusty) ice may also promote\nthe direct uptake of gas phase nitric acid onto the ice sur-\nface. Whichever process is dominant, we indeed see some\nexamples where the highest spikes of nitrate in surface snow\nare clearly associated with exceptionally high concentrations\nof sea salt. The importance of this conclusion is that sea\nsalt excursions can be highly episodic, with high concentra-\ntions often lasting for just a few days; short-term excursions\nin nitrate deposition, at least at coastal Antarctic sites, may\ntherefore be controlled by episodes of sea salt production that\nhappen to coincide with a period of snowfall.\n3.3 SPEs and nitrate deposition\nSPEs last for periods of hours to days and should enhance the\nproduction of nitrogen oxides in the middle and upper atmo-\nsphere. However, the question arises whether such events are\ncapable of leading to a signal in deposited snow that consists\nof an increase in nitrate concentration of factor 4, confined to\nperhaps a single snowfall or a few weeks. Modelling (using a\ntwo-dimensional zonally-averaged photochemical transport\nmodel) suggested that, even for the largest SPEs of the last\n30 years, the stratospheric burden of NOy should only have\nincreased by just over 10%, or up to 40% at specific alti-\ntudes and latitudes in the stratosphere (Vitt et al., 2000); an-\nother process, oxidation of N2O by O1D, remains the dom-\ninant stratospheric source. It is hard to see how a spike of\nlarger magnitude than this relative to the background con-\ncentration could be generated in polar snow by an SPE. The\npropagation of the SPE event in NOy downwards into the\nstratosphere as a rapid and sharp signal is also influenced by\nvery variable atmospheric dynamics (Clilverd et al., 2007);\nfurther transport from the stratosphere into the troposphere\ndepends either on stratosphere-troposphere exchange or on\ndescent in polar stratospheric cloud particles (PSCs), and it\nis not obvious that the episodicity of the SPE itself can be\nmaintained during these processes. Finally, we note that in\nthe most comprehensive statistical study of the relationship\nbetween nitrate in (20th century Antarctic) snow and SPEs, a\nsmall increase in nitrate after such events was observed, but\nthe increase was just a few percent (Palmer et al., 2001). On\ncurrent understanding, it is therefore hard to understand how\nspikes of the magnitude seen in polar snow can be generated\nby SPEs, and it is not clear that enhancements should be so\nsharp in the snow for such events.\n3.4 The origin of sharp spikes in nitrate concentration in\npolar ice\nIn the last section, we showed that, while SPEs can lead to\nsome enhancement of nitrate deposition to snow, it appears\ndifficult to produce snow concentration spikes of sufficient\nmagnitude from them. We have shown for Halley in coastal\nAntarctica, that the episodic deposition of aerosol nitrate, as-\nsociated with high concentrations of sea salt, does provide a\nsimple mechanism by which spikes of this sort can occur.\nOf the sites where nitrate signals attributed to SPEs have\nbeen observed, one (Windless Bight) (McCracken et al.,\n2001) is a site close to sea level in the Ross Ice Shelf, which\nhas high concentrations of sea salt (Palais et al., 1989). The\nmechanisms we have proposed for Halley should operate at\nsuch sites.\nFor central Greenland and central Antarctica, although\nsea salt input may be rather episodic, it will rarely be at\nconcentrations that could cause the effects described above.\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 8, 5627\u20135634, 2008 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/8\/5627\/2008\/\nE. W. Wolff et al.: Nitrate in polar ice 5631\nHowever, similar effects can be expected in association\nwith other cations, such as ammonium or calcium. These\nions are at insignificant concentrations relative to nitrate\nin present-day snow at Halley. However, ammonium\nshows strong and sharp concentration spikes in Greenland\nice, arising from very short-lived episodes of transport of\nbiomass burning material from North America (Fuhrer et\nal., 1996). Biomass burning may also be a direct source\nof nitrate reaching Greenland. Whatever the cause, there\nare definitely short-lived spikes in nitrate in snow from\nSummit and other Arctic sites that are strongly associated\nwith spikes in ammonium (Whitlow et al., 1994). This\nprovides a plausible alternative source of spikes in nitrate\nconcentration at Summit, the second site where nitrate\nsignals have previously been attributed to SPEs (McCracken\net al., 2001).\nFinally, for central Antarctica, neither sea salt nor ammo-\nnium will generally be at elevated concentrations. However,\nfor sites with very low accumulation rates such as Dome C\nand Vostok, extensive post-depositional loss (Ro\u00a8thlisberger\net al., 2000) makes it highly unlikely that original short-\nterm signals are preserved in any recognisable form. Even at\nSouth Pole, deposition peaks are substantially modified after\nburial (Dibb and Whitlow, 1996).\nIn summary, the importance of short-term variability in\ndeposition of the aerosol component, such as we have doc-\numented above, makes it very unlikely that spikes in ni-\ntrate concentration in ice can be simply or reliably corre-\nlated with short-lived production events, such as solar proton\nevents (e.g. Shea et al., 1999; Zeller and Dreschhoff, 1995)\nat most sites. It might however be possible, through careful\nscreening of data in which multiple ions were measured to re-\nmove sea salt (or other cation) associated deposition events,\nand through the independent use of multiple carefully-chosen\nsites, to isolate any events that are not due to local deposition\nsignals. Such a study has not yet been attempted.\n4 The seasonal and interannual signal of nitrate deposi-\ntion\nWe have shown in Sect. 3 that variability in nitrate deposition\n(at least in coastal Antarctica) at synoptic timescales is most\nlikely related to atmospheric dynamics and deposition rather\nthan to source changes. However, we can consider whether\nsuch controls average out over longer periods, leaving pro-\nduction changes to dominate the budget of nitrate reaching\nthe ground. In order to do this, we briefly consider what\ncontrols the seasonal and interannual concentrations seen in\nsnow at Halley and other sites.\nThe seasonal cycle of snow nitrate concentrations at Hal-\nley shows a summer peak that appears to be closely related to\na summer increase in gas-phase HNO3 concentrations (Jones\net al., 2007). The summer peak in snow concentration has\nalready been reported from both Halley and Neumayer sta-\ntions from earlier years (Mulvaney et al., 1998). An early to\nmid-summer peak in nitrate concentrations in air (based on\nmeasurements assumed to be of total (gas-phase plus aerosol)\nnitrate) has also been noted previously for different coastal\nsites (Wagenbach et al., 1998), while a summer maximum of\ngas-phase nitric acid was clearly measured at one site (Jour-\ndain and Legrand, 2002). Whilst it is difficult to interpret this\nin the absence of seasonal information about nitrate concen-\ntrations at higher (cloud-formation) levels in the atmosphere,\nit seems reasonable to assume that the summer peak in ni-\ntrate deposition to snow (at a time when both sea salt and\ncontinental dust concentrations are often low) is indeed re-\nlated to increased source strengths, i.e. to an increased input\nof nitrate to the relevant part of the atmosphere.\nIt has proved difficult to determine what are the main\nsources of nitrate to the polar troposphere (Wolff, 1995). In\nearlier work, it has been proposed that the most important\nsource of nitrate to the coastal Antarctic lower atmosphere\nwas the stratosphere, both through air mass exchange from\nthe stratosphere to the troposphere, and through sedimenta-\ntion of nitrate-rich polar stratospheric cloud particles (Wa-\ngenbach et al., 1998). A small spring seasonal maximum in\nconcentration could be related to the time of PSC sedimenta-\ntion, but it was less clear why there was a main maximum in\nmid-summer.\nRecently, using a combination of aerosol concentration\nand isotopic measurements (Savarino et al., 2007) for the\nDumont d\u2019Urville site, it was suggested that, while the strato-\nsphere likely did contribute to the spring peak, the summer\npeak was most likely caused by the appearance of nitrate that\nhad been re-emitted from inland sites and then transported\nfrom the Antarctic plateau. The idea behind this is that it has\nbeen clearly shown that central Antarctic sites (with very low\nsnow accumulation rates) have extremely high initial concen-\ntrations of nitrate (as high as 1000\u00b5g kg\u22121), but that these\nvalues decay to much lower ones (as low as 10 \u00b5g kg\u22121) at\ndepths of 1\u20132 m (Ro\u00a8thlisberger et al., 2000). This loss of\nnitrate may be partly to do with the photolysis of nitrate in\nnear-surface snow that contributes strongly to the NOx con-\ntent of the atmosphere at sites such as South Pole (Davis et\nal., 2004). However, it has also been proposed that it is dom-\ninated by the simple evaporative re-emission of nitric acid\n(Blunier et al., 2005), and that this emission (depleted in 15N)\nalso explains the very low 15N content of aerosol at coastal\nsites during the summer maximum (Savarino et al., 2007;\nWagenbach et al., 1998).\nIn either case, the implication of this finding is that the\nsummer maximum in concentration of gas-phase nitric acid,\nand of deposition to snow at coastal sites, is not due to an\ninput from primary sources, but is rather the result of a re-\ncycling from inland regions. In that case the strength of the\nsummer maximum in a given year (and because it dominates\nthe annual deposition, therefore the average annual value)\nwill be controlled by the strength of emission and transport\nfrom the central plateau regions. Emission strength must be\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/8\/5627\/2008\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 8, 5627\u20135634, 2008\n5632 E. W. Wolff et al.: Nitrate in polar ice\ncontrolled mainly by factors in central Antarctica: the ini-\ntially deposited concentrations there, and the temperature,\naccumulation rate and available sunlight. Transport strength\nto a particular site will depend on the directions of airmass\nmovement in the near-surface layers, and the extent of mix-\ning to higher levels.\nThere is an urgent need to confirm whether it is correct\nthat material recycled from and within the interior is a major\nsource of nitrate for Antarctic ice. This will likely require\npainstaking concentration and isotopic studies along lines of\ntransport from the interior, coupled with a new generation of\nmodels. If it is correct, it implies that time series of nitrate\nin ice at individual sites in Antarctica cannot be used to diag-\nnose changes in NOy source strength until the meteorological\nfactors controlling losses at interior sites and gains at coastal\nsites are understood well enough to account for them.\nThe situation was probably very different during parts\nof the last glacial period, when concentrations of both sea\nsalt and terrestrial dust in Antarctica were much higher\nthan at present (Wolff et al., 2006). Under such circum-\nstances we can imagine that evaporative post-depositional\nloss was almost stopped (Legrand et al., 1999; Ro\u00a8thlisberger\net al., 2000), transport of recycled nitrate from the plateau to\nthe coast may have been minimal, and although deposition\nstrength at high resolution could still have been controlled by\nthe concentrations of aerosol material, at low resolution, the\nconcentration of nitrate in snow at Halley and other coastal\nsites might indeed have been determined by the amount of\ninput from other sources, notably the stratosphere. Analysis\nof the nitrate isotopic content of glacial ice from coastal and\ninland sites would test whether it is correct that the recycling\nhad ceased, and whether the remaining material was likely to\nbe of stratospheric origin.\n5 Can we derive information about NOy production\nfrom nitrate concentrations in Antarctic snow?\nThere remains the question as to whether there are other ways\nof deriving information at an annual resolution. At some\nscale, all the material that subsides from the stratosphere into\nthe lowest levels of the polar atmosphere must either be de-\nposited in Antarctica or advected across the coast. Would\nit be possible through a network of cores to assess temporal\nvariability in the total deposition of nitrate to Antarctica? If\nwe could assume that the amount of nitrate advected across\nthe coast is either relatively small or rather constant, then it\nmight be possible to make a crude assessment of variations\nin the input of nitrate to the entire Antarctic troposphere.\nTo estimate the feasibility of such an approach, we note\nthat the net surface mass balance of snow in Antarctica\nhas been calculated as 2288 Gt a\u22121 over the whole conti-\nnent including ice shelves (Vaughan et al., 1999). The\naverage nitrate concentration retained in snow (i.e. below\nthe surface layer) across Antarctica varies with snow accu-\nmulation rate, being very low (\u223c15\u00b5g kg\u22121) due to post-\ndepositional loss at the sites with extremely low accumu-\nlation rate (<50 kg m\u22122 a\u22121), relatively high (up to about\n100\u00b5g kg\u22121) at sites with moderately low accumulation\nrate, falling with increasing accumulation rate to about\n20\u00b5g kg\u22121 at sites with very high accumulation rates (Mul-\nvaney and Wolff, 1994). To estimate the total nitrate accu-\nmulation across Antarctica, we used the snow accumulation\nrates recently derived from satellite measurements (Arthern\net al., 2006). We applied a transformation in which we es-\ntimated the concentration of nitrate to be 15\u00b5g kg\u22121 wher-\never the snow accumulation rate is lower than 50 kg m\u22122 a\u22121;\nfor sites with accumulation rate above the threshold, we ap-\nplied an exponential function for nitrate concentration based\non the observed spatial distribution (Mulvaney and Wolff,\n1994) (giving 23\u00b5g kg\u22121 at very high snow accumulation\nrates, and 90\u00b5g kg\u22121 just above the 50 kg m\u22122 a\u22121 accumu-\nlation threshold). Using this, we estimate the total deposi-\ntion over the ice (grounded plus ice shelf) of Antarctica to be\naround 8.6\u00d7107 kg (as NO\u22123 ) per year (with an uncertainty\nbased mainly on uncertainty in the nitrate\/accumulation rate\nrelationship, of about 20%). If we also estimate the aver-\nage concentration of nitrate in near surface air at coastal sites\nto be around 30 ng m\u22123 (average of 3 coastal sites, Wagen-\nbach et al., 1998), and assume a net meridional wind speed of\n\u223c5 m s\u22121 (Ko\u00a8nig-Langlo et al., 1998), then the net outflow of\nnitrate across the coast (circle at 70\u25e6 S of 14 000 km) would\nbe 7\u00d7104*h kg yr\u22121, where h is the height over which out-\nflow of air occurs across the coast. Other NOy species could\nalso contribute to the net loss from the region. The outflow\nof nitrate is therefore only negligible compared to the deposi-\ntion in Antarctica if the depth of outflow is\u001c1000 m. There\nare few data with which to estimate this however.\nIt can be seen that it would not be a simple undertaking to\nestimate changes in source strength even from a network of\ncores. It may be feasible to estimate the total deposition to\nAntarctica within a few percent with a large enough network\nof cores, but only if the outflow can be constrained will it be\npossible to estimate net production over the continent to the\nsame precision. Far more study of what controls the distri-\nbution of nitrate across Antarctica is needed if one is to have\nany confidence that nitrate concentrations either at a single\nsite or from a network can be used to estimate changes in\nproduction of NOy across Antarctica.\n6 Conclusions\nNumerous short-lived spikes of high nitrate concentrations\ncertainly occur in records of snowfall at Halley, and these are\nlikely to translate into a smaller number of preserved spikes\nin ice core records, and to be seen at other sites. However, at\nleast some of these spikes certainly relate to episodic inputs\nof high sea salt concentrations that cause a partitioning of ni-\ntrate to aerosol and\/or a trapping of nitrate in snow. Although\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 8, 5627\u20135634, 2008 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/8\/5627\/2008\/\nE. W. Wolff et al.: Nitrate in polar ice 5633\nwe cannot rule out that some spikes could also be related to\nan increase in the production of NOy (for example in SPEs),\nthere will certainly be no one-to-one correlation. A realistic\nsearch for such production changes calls for a major study\nof different ice core sites, influenced by different transport\npathways and sea salt influences, in order to search for con-\ntemporaneous spikes that are not influenced by deposition\nstrength. Further modelling studies to estimate how a brief\nSPE should be recorded in the polar lower troposphere (and\nultimately in snow) should also be carried out. Until such\nwork is complete, it is not possible to use nitrate spikes in ice\ncores as indications of solar proton activity.\nOn longer timescales, significant recycling of material\nfrom central to coastal Antarctica may confound efforts to\nassess nitrate input on an interannual basis using any single\ncore. More work is needed to assess the importance of this\nprocess before proceeding. Studies are needed to assess the\nspatial extent of regions that experience loss of nitrate, and to\ndetermine more closely the conditions that control the extent\nof such losses; further studies of isotopic balance would also\ncontribute quantitative information on the importance of this\nprocess.\nFinally, we estimate that carrying out an Antarctic-wide\nsurvey of nitrate deposition as a proxy for the continent-wide\ninput of NOy to the Antarctic troposphere can only succeed\nwhen the relative budgets of nitrate that is deposited and ad-\nvected out of the continent is pinned down. This calls for\nprofiling studies of NOy above the surface of Antarctica, es-\npecially in the outflow regions, to assess horizontal fluxes.\nIn short, except over time periods and spatial scales when\ntransport and deposition can be assumed to be reasonably\nconstant, we are not yet in a position to use nitrate in polar\nice cores to assess quantitatively large-scale changes in NOy\nproduced in or transported to the polar regions.\nAcknowledgements.
