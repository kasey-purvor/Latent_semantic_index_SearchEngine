Mammals are unable\nto synthesize folates so that these essential nutrients must be ob-\ntained from dietary sources [2]. Hence, intestinal folate absorption\nis a critical element in folate homeostasis. Recently, the mecha-\nnism of intestinal folate absorption was clari\ufb01ed with the cloning\nof the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT)1 which was shown\nto be mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary folate\nmalabsorption [3\u20135]. Since the initial reports, three additional kin-\ndreds have been described with this disorder in which the PCFT gene\nwas mutated [6\u20138].ll rights reserved.\nedical and Molecular Genet-\nirmingham, Birmingham B15\n, m.kurian@bham.ac.uk (M.A.\nbath@kcl.ac.uk (R.C.

This is associated\nwith megaloblastic anemia and hypoimmunoglobulinemia often\nresulting in severe infections. In many cases, there are also neuro-\nlogical de\ufb01cits such as developmental delay, mental retardation,\nand seizures. This is related to a defect in the transport of folates\ninto central nervous system as manifested by very low levels of fo-\nlate in the cerebrospinal \ufb02uid [5]. Unless diagnosed early, HFM can\nbe fatal or cause permanent neurological damage. However, if\ntreatment with parenteral folate or high doses of oral folate is\nstarted early in infancy, the signs and symptoms of this disease\ncan resolve completely and children can develop normally.\nHere we report on the clinical course of four siblings with a mild\nform of HFM and demonstrate a mutation in the PCFT gene that re-\nsults in the complete loss of the PCFT protein.\nMethods\nSubjects\nA consanguineous family of Pakistani origin with four children\naffected with HFM was ascertained and recruited for molecular ge-\nnetic analysis. Ethnically matched laboratory control samples were\nanalysed to evaluate the signi\ufb01cance of novel sequence variants.\n326 E. Meyer et al. \/Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 99 (2010) 325\u2013328Participants gave informed consent; the study was approved by\nSouth Birmingham Local Research Ethics Committee and was per-\nformed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nDNA extraction\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes by\nstandard techniques.\nGenetic linkage analysis\nPrior to PFCT gene sequencing we con\ufb01rmed linkage with two\nmicrosatellite markers, D17S2196 at 17.21 Mb and D17S1863 at\n25.95 Mb that \ufb02ank the PCFT gene (located at 23.75\u201323.76 Mb)\non chromosome 17 (further details on request).\nMutational analysis\nMutational analysis of PCFT was carried out by direct sequenc-\ning. The genomic DNA sequence of this gene was taken from\nEnsembl (http:\/\/www.ensembl.org\/index.html) and primer pairs\nfor the translated exons \ufb02anking exon\u2013intron boundaries were de-\nsigned using primer3 software (http:\/\/fokker.wi.mit.edu\/primer3\/\ninput.htm). Ampli\ufb01cation was performed according to standard\nprotocols with BioMix\u2122 Red (Bioline Ltd., London, UK). For ampli-\n\ufb01cation of dif\ufb01cult fragments such as GC rich sequences either 10%\nDMSO or GC rich solution of FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche\nDiagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, UK) was added to get PCR product.\nPCR conditions were an initial denaturation step at 95 \u0003C for\n5 min followed 35 cycles 30 s denaturation at 95 \u0003C, 1 min anneal-\ning at 57\u201361.5 \u0003C (depending on fragment) and 1 min extension at\n72 \u0003C with a \ufb01nal extension at 72 \u0003C for 5 min. The PCR products\npuri\ufb01ed with MicroCLEAN (Web Scienti\ufb01c, Crewe, UK) were di-\nrectly sequenced by Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing System\n(Applied Biosystem) and cleaned up using the EDTAmethod of pre-\ncipitation. Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 3730\nDNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem) and were analyzed using Chro-\nmas software (http:\/\/www.technelysium.com.au\/chromas.html).\nResults\nClinical \ufb01ndings\nEight children were born to healthy consanguineous parents\n(\ufb01rst cousins) of Pakistani origin (Fig. 1). There was no family his-\ntory of recurrent infection, haematological or neurological disor-\nders. All children were born following a normal pregnancy and\nbirth, and had an uneventful early neonatal course. Three children\n(II:1, II:3 and II:7) were healthy individuals with no evidence of\nhaematological or neurological disease.Fig. 1. Pedigree and haplotype analysis of family with folate malabsorption. The analysi\nlocus as an identical homozygous haplotype is observed in all four affected individuals. F\nindividuals.Child II:2 died at 3 months of age secondary to bronchopneumo-\nnia associated with severe anemia. On post-mortem examination,\nbone marrow histology revealed megaloblastic cellular changes. A\nprovisional diagnosis of thalassaemia major was made (thalassae-\nmia A carrier status was detected in both parents), although genetic\ncon\ufb01rmation of disease status was not undertaken.\nTheir fourth child (II:4), a male infant, presented at 3 months of\nage with pallor and feeding dif\ufb01culties (weight 10th centile). Gen-\neral physical examination was normal and no dysmorphic features\nwere evident. On haematological investigation he was found to be\nanemic (8.3 g\/dl, normal range: 13.0\u201318.0 g\/dl) and subsequent\nbone marrow examination con\ufb01rmed a severe megaloblastic pic-\nture. Further biochemical investigations showed a markedly low\nfolate level (serum folate: 0.58 ng\/ml, normal range: 2.4\u201312.0 ng\/\nml; red cell folate: 104 ng\/ml, normal range: 160\u2013800 ng\/ml), sug-\ngestive of a disorder of folate de\ufb01ciency. Twice weekly injections of\nfolinic acid (3 mg i.m.) were instigated and serum folate levels nor-\nmalised within three weeks of starting therapy. At age three years,\nCSF investigation revealed a low folate (2.7 ng\/ml, normal mean:\n24 ng\/ml). In early childhood, he made normal neurodevelopmen-\ntal progress and there were no abnormalities on neurological\nexamination. However from 8 years of age, there were concerns\nregarding some anti-social behavioural traits. At school, mild\nlearning dif\ufb01culties associated with a reduced attention span and\nproblems with concentration were also reported. Formal cognitive\nassessment revealed that he was functioning at a level 2.5\u20133 years\nbelow the expected norm. At the age of 19 years he developed\nsymptoms of myalgia and muscle fatigue. Nerve conduction stud-\nies and electromyelogram were normal.\nThe \ufb01fth child, (II:5) a male infant, also presented with feeding\nand breathing dif\ufb01culties at age 2 months. His clinical presentation\nand disease course was very similar to his older brother.\nIn light of the family history, close monitoring of subsequent\nchildren was undertaken from birth. In patient II:6 and II:8, the\nred cell folate was normal at birth, and thus folinic acid treatment\nwas initially deferred. However, both children presented in early\ninfancy with vomiting, feeding dif\ufb01culties and shortness of breath.\nIn II:6, further clinical examination and cardiorespiratory investi-\ngation at presentation revealed a bronchopneumonia and fulmin-\nant heart failure.\nLike their older brothers, both infants developed a megaloblas-\ntic anemia, and were also treated with folinic acid, following diag-\nnosis of a low serum and red cell folate. Although there were\nconcerns regarding cognitive and motor dif\ufb01culties on develop-\nmental assessment of II:6 (age 4.5 years), these improved signi\ufb01-\ncantly during childhood. She proceeded to mainstream secondary\nschool and there were no ongoing major concerns regarding school\nperformance. Patient II:8 showed normal neurodevelopmentals of two microsatellite markers of each side of the PCFT gene shows linkage to this\nurthermore the unaffected siblings do not share the same genotype as the affected\nFig. 2.

Unlike their older siblings,\nneither II:6 or II:8 had behavioural dif\ufb01culties.\nThe patients are now age 25 (II:4), 23 (II:5), 19 (II:6) and 15\n(II:8) years old. They all continue on twice weekly folinic acid\ntreatment (3 mg i.m.) and remain asymptomatic (no major recur-\nrent infections or neurological sequelae).\nMolecular genetic analysis\nMolecular genetic investigation was undertaken using a posi-\ntional-candidate gene approach. Thus genetic linkage studies with\n\ufb02anking markers (D17S2196 and D17S1863) were consistent with\nlinkage to the PCFT gene (maximum LOD score of 2.68 at h = 0.0 at\nD17S1863; Fig. 1) and direct sequencing of the PCFT gene was then\nundertaken. A novel homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 1\n(c.194dupG, NM_080669.3; Fig. 2) that was predicted (in the ab-\nsence of nonsense-mediatedRNAdecay) to result in a truncatedpro-\ntein (p.Cys66LeufsX99, NP_542400.2) lacking 296 amino acids from\nthe C-terminus was detected in all affected individuals. The muta-\ntion was not detected in 364 ethnically matched control chromo-\nsomes and showed appropriate disease segregation within the\nfamily (themotherwas heterozygous for themutation and the unaf-\nfected siblings were either heterozygous or showed wild-type se-\nquence). In addition a rare missense variant was detected that\ncosegregated with the frameshift mutation (c.340C>T; p.Arg114Cys).\nThis variant was not detected in 564 control chromosomes.\nDiscussion\nThe PCFT gene product has been implicated in folate receptor-\nmediated endocytosis by serving as a route of export of folatesfrom acidi\ufb01ed endosomes into the cytoplasm and regulates folate\ntransport and absorption in intestine and other human tissues at\nlow pH [3,9]. To date 9 different PCFT mutations (located in 4 of\nthe 5 exons) have been reported in 10 ethnically varied kindreds.\nThe novel frameshift mutation (c.194dupG; p.Cys66LeufsX99) we\nidenti\ufb01ed affects the same mononucleotide tract (consisting of 7\nguanines) as a previously reported frameshift mutation that is pre-\ndicted to result in a different truncated protein, (c.194delG;\np.Gly65AlafsX25) [4]. This is consistent with the known hypermu-\ntability of such sequence tracts. Previously c.194delG was shown\nto be associated with complete lack of protein expression [4].\nAlthough information on PCFT mutation spectrum is, as yet, re-\nstricted we note that in addition to the two mutations at the exon\n1 mononucleotide repeat, two mutations at the same arginine res-\nidue have been reported (p.Arg113Ser and p.Arg113Cys) (Table 1)\nindicating that this residue plays an important role in folate trans-\nport function [4,6]. However, three previously reported missense\nmutations, p.Arg113Cys, p.Arg113Ser and p.Arg376Trp occur at\nhypermutable CpG dinucleotides [4,6]. All six missense mutations\naffected residues that were located within, or in the direct vicinity,\nof the predicted twelve transmembrane domains.\nClassically HFM presents clinically in early infancy with anemia.\nHowever, there is considerable phenotypic variation between indi-\nviduals with HFM [5]. Early clinical recognition of HFM is impor-\ntant because signi\ufb01cant morbidity and mortality may be\nprevented with prompt diagnosis and treatment. The phenotype\nappears to be milder in individuals where the diagnosis is made\nat an early stage in infancy. However, in the absence of a positive\nfamily history, the diagnosis may often be delayed. Certainly in\nthe family we describe, it is notable that the two younger children\n(in whom treatment was commenced early) had fewer neurologi-\nTable 1\nKnown mutations in PCFT in association with HFM.\nKindred (-patient) Nucleotidechange Amino acid change Mutation type Exon Ref.\n1\u20131\/2 c.1082\u20131 G>A p.Tyr362_Gly389 del Splice site Intron 2 [3,8]\n2 c.194delG p.Gly65AlafsX25 Frameshift 1 [4]\n3 c.337 C>A p.Arg113Ser Missense 2 [4]\n4 c.439 G>C p.Gly147Arg Missense 2 [4]\n5 c.1274 C>G p.Pro425Arg Missense 4 [4]\n6 c.954 C>G; p.Ser318Arg; Missense 2; [4]\nc.1126 C>T p.Arg376Trp Missense 3\n7 c.337 C>T p.Arg113Cys Missense 2 [6]\n8 c.197_198 GC>AA p.Cys66X Nonsense 1 [7]\n9\u20131\/4 c.194dupG p.Cys66LeufsX99 Frameshift 1 Current study\nModi\ufb01ed from Zhao et al.

Molecular genetic testing can thus facilitate\nearly diagnosis and treatment. In families with identi\ufb01ed disease-\ncausing mutations, prenatal or early antenatal testing could predict\ndisease status (prior to the postnatal drop in folate or haemoglobin\nlevels) and thus allow early folate therapy in affected cases.\nTo date no genotype\u2013phenotype correlations are apparent but\nfunctional analysis of some missense mutations (e.g. p.Arg113Ser\n[4]) has shown severe effects on transporter function similar to\nthe effect of truncating mutations. Nevertheless, interfamilial vari-\nations in phenotype between kindreds with similar loss of function\nPCFT mutations suggest that factors other than the precise nature\nof the PCFT mutation in\ufb02uence clinical phenotype. Hence genetic\nand\/or environmental modi\ufb01er effects may also be implicated.\nInterestingly, Pcft-de\ufb01cient mice have greatly increased homocys-\nteine levels (which are also in\ufb02uenced by diet and genetic variants\nin other genes) that could contribute to pathophysiological mani-\nfestations of HMF [10]. Increased recognition of HFM and the iden-\nti\ufb01cation of further families and PCFT mutations will provide\nopportunities to de\ufb01ne possible genotype\u2013phenotype correlations\nand further explore the basis of the marked phenotypic variability\nthat is characteristic of this condition.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the patients and their family for their help\nwith this study.
