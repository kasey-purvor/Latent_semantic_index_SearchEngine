Introduction\nAgriculture is the primary land use across Europe, hence future European land use is largely a\nfunction of the activity chosen for this sector. The main driving factor that determines how\nagricultural land is managed is profitability (Rounsevell, et al., 2003). A low profit can lead to\nland abandonment. Conversely a large profit can lead to forest and land that is otherwise\nunsuitable, being converted to agriculture. The changes in relative profit between enterprises\n(whether due to technology, subsidy or economics) can lead to large areas of single crops,\nlandscapes of brightly coloured crops, and arable crops replacing permanent grassland on\nslopes. All these changes in agricultural land use have profound impacts on the quality of the\nlandscape and the environment through, for example, nutrient dynamics, soil erosion,\necological diversity and food resources for birds and other wildlife. In the second half of the\n20th century technology and socio-economic change have driven rapid changes in land use\n(Ewert et al., in press; Rounsevell et al., in press). In the future these two driving forces will\nremain, but the trend of land use change is likely to be enhanced by additional drivers that\nnow exist; climate change and subsidy structures favouring environmental protection. This\nleads to questions about what type of land use change is likely to result from all these drivers.\nWill the same type of changes continue, be reversed, or be replaced by different types of land\nuse?\nPredicting the future is regarded as impossible. A common approach to studying the future is\nto attempt to define a number of possible futures, called scenarios, which span the space of all\nfutures. Abildtrup et al (2005) describe a procedure for defining such scenarios for agriculture\nin terms of population, economic, technical, climate and social changes. In general, scenarios\nare a product of their time and so they consider drivers that are important for that time.\nUnknown drivers that will become important in the future are by definition not included, and\nit can be instructive to consider how one would have predicted today\u2019s world from 1950.\nWithin that caveat however, modelling the land use that is implied by a scenario permits the\nstudy of possible impacts and, by including possible policy responses in the scenarios, the\nstudy of the means to prevent undesirable impacts. One question is whether the impacts are\nsimply a function of the particular scenario or whether the collection of all scenarios provides\nuseful information about future impacts and their mitigation. An outcome that is affected by\nthe scenarios may be:\n1. similar for all scenarios. This implies this aspect of the future is not as uncertain as\nthe scenarios. While policy makers can expect this outcome to happen, it also implies\nthey cannot control it.\n2. similar for all scenarios except one or two, or split into groups of scenarios. This\nimplies that a certain aspect of these scenarios has a large influence, for example\nrainfall distribution differences between climate models. This aspect is thus an\nindicator for policy makers concerned with outcomes.\n3. different for all scenarios. This is least informative, although it may be possible to\nidentify an observable trend with some aspect of the scenarios. This aspect is thus an\nindicator for policy makers concerned with outcomes.\nDecisions about agricultural land use are actually made by farmers, with the general aim of\nmaximising the profit they achieve from the land, within the plethora of subsidies, support\npayments, grants and restrictions that attempt to drive their decisions in particular directions.\nTheir primary constraints are the soil and the climate. Many models have been developed to\nconsider the problem of predicting future land use (Rounsevell et al., 2003; Thornton, 1998;\nHossell et al, 1996; Klocking et al, 2003; Zander, 1999; Veldkamp, 2004). They differ in the\n3level of detailed choices they consider, whether the individual decision maker is modelled and\nthe specific region of Europe within which they can be applied. Lambin et al., 2000 reviewed\nthe different modelling approaches that have been used in land-use change research. Their\ncase studies highlight the importance of modelling the decision-making process that drives\nland management. LP optimisation methods (Annetts, 2002) are thus suitable because they\ndescribe the core of this process. Thornton, 1998 and Lambin et al. (2000) highlight\nuncertainty, whereas Murray-Prior (1998) highlights farmer behaviour as the important\naspect, which leads to a range of land uses being chosen for a similar circumstance. This is\naccommodated in a LP approach by using a range of objective functions to simulate a range\nof behaviours (Rounsevell et al., 2003) and the concept that the purpose of the model is to\nsimulate the aggregate behaviour of farmers in a region, not generate a land use pattern.\nHossell et al. (1996) determined prices from world food market demand and consequent gross\nmargins to determine land use. As LPs are partial equilibrium future land use models, they\nneed a price adjusting mechanism to prevent over- or under-estimation of the production of\nany commodity. This is particularly important where future scenarios define increased\ndemand and\/or increased productivity. Within an individual based approach it is necessary to\naggregate the new optimised production, compare it with demand and adjust prices\nappropriately, taking account of world supply and prices.\nThe objective of the model used here is to estimate land use change at the European scale.\nRegional models have implicit assumptions about agriculture due to the region in which they\nare created. These manifest themselves in the constraints, which are included and omitted.\nThis model predicts the actions of the collections of individual decision makers using the\nsame model over the whole of Europe \u2013 that is from the north of Finland to the south of Spain\nand Greece and from the west of Ireland and Portugal to the east of Poland and Romania.\nOne of the questions to be addressed in this study is how far this model is capable of\nsimulating all European land managers and which areas need further development.\n2. Method\n2.1 Overview of the modelling approach\nThe concept of the agricultural land use analysis is that farmers seek to maximise their long-\nterm profits, within the constraints of their situation, taking account of uncertainty in prices\nand yields, which causes otherwise identical farms to perceive different crop gross margins.\n(Annetts, 2002). Land use on a regional scale is the sum of the results of decision-making at\nthe farm level (Rounsevell et al., 2003). A farm is constrained by its physical situation, which\ncan be summarised as soil, climate and slope. These define the cropping options available to\nthe farmer. Given a particular economy, farmers will choose the cropping which they\nindividually consider most profitable.\nThe procedure determines the profitability of a soil\/climate unit. If the land is sufficiently\nprofitable, it will be used for intensive agriculture \u2013 which is defined either as annual arable\ncropping or dairy farming. Below this level, land that is marginally profitable is assumed to\nbe used for extensive agriculture \u2013 in the UK this would typically be grazing of beef or sheep.\nLand that is not profitable for use is classified as abandoned, although this could include for\nexample forestry. Given any future scenario of climate, economics or technology, the\nprocedure determines where land will change use between the three classes of intensive,\nextensive and abandoned. Note that this study does not consider the timescale over which\nchanges will occur, effectively assuming that by 2050 significant changes will have occurred,\nsince this is ample time for several economic cycles. Clearly the impetus to change will\n4depend on the difference in profit and the capital needed, and policy incentives to accelerate\nor decelerate change, identifying the need for which is one purpose of this study.\nAnnetts (2002) describe the optimising farm model to determine crop choice in detail, but the\nunderlying concept of linear programming model can be summarised as:\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\nijk\nijkmijkm\nm\nm\ni\niiii xTnCaVYPz )( (1)\nsubject to\nmknHxL mmk\nij\nijkmijm ,\uf022\uf0a3\uf0e5 (2)\nmjiax\nk\niijkm ,,\uf022\uf03d\uf0e5 (3)\nwhere\n\uf0b7 the variables (lower case) represent profit (z), crop area (ai), number of men and\nmachines(nm), and area (x) of an operation (j) on a crop in a period of time (k)\n\uf0b7 the constants (upper case) represent the crop price(P), yield(Y), variable costs(V), cost\nof men and machinery(C), timeliness penalty(T), labour and machinery\nrequirement(L) and workable hours in a period(H)\nThe model uses a flexible approach when choosing crop rotations, using planting and\nharvesting timeliness, rotation penalties and workable hours as a function of precipitation and\nsoil data, making it ideal for selecting future cropping systems, which may not exist now. It\nalso includes dairy cows with grazing, silage making and feed constraints. The model takes\naccount of the variable perception by farmers of prices and yields by determining the average\ncropping of 10 price and yield sets for each soil.\nFarm size is often considered an important variable. A study of Danish farms comparing the\ncropping on small and large farms, found that the average cropping was not different\n(Albidtrup 2002). In Greece, we found that the definition of a farm was not a useful concept\nfor land use, as the main agricultural areas were farmed by large-scale machinery by land\nmanagers. A similar situation was found in Italy although it was less clear how much input to\nthe crop choice the land owner had. Therefore the model was defined to be independent of\nfarm size and uses workrates for machinery sizes typical of 200ha farms. Increasing future\nfarm sizes was modelled by reducing labour per hectare.\nDifferent regions and climate scenarios were modelled by changing the values of the farm\nmodel\u2019s constants as a function of soil and climate. These were calculated as the first step in\nthe modelling process using a crop\/soil\/climate model. In addition to calculating the yield of\neach crop, possible sowing dates, harvest dates and soil workability were calculated.\n2.2 Data available\nThe key spatially-explicit biophysical variables are:\na. Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at the scale 1:1,000,000 version 3.2.8.0,\n19\/07\/1999. The database divides Europe into Soil Mapping Unit (SMU) polygons, each\nof which contains a number of Soil Typological Units (STU). STUs are described by\nvariables (attributes) specifying the nature and properties of the soils, e.g. texture, water\nregime, stoniness, etc.\nb. Climate data. These data were based on a 10\u2019 grid for Europe with monthly time steps\nusing observations for 1961-2000 (Mitchell et al., 2004)\n5c. Land cover data. Pelcom (Pan-European Land Cover Monitoring) contains land cover\ninformation for the whole of Europe at a 1 km resolution based on Earth Observation data.\nd. Administrative boundary data. Data at the NUTS2 level were obtained from ESRI in\nshapefile format.\n2.3 Models\n2.3.1 Crop yield model (ROIMPEL)\nGeneral description\nAn agro-climatic simulation model (Mayr et al., 1996) was developed based on the soil\/terrain\ninformation and weather\/climate variables to predict the water-, air temperature-, nitrogen-\nlimited crop yields, sowing and maturity days and the number of workable days (providing\nconstants Y, T and H). The minimum requirement for soils data are the soil texture and\norganic matter classes. The minimum weather data needed by the model are monthly values\nof the average daily air temperature and the monthly-cumulated precipitation. For this study\nnitrogen is assumed not to be limiting.\nAlgorithms\nThe soil is considered as a single reservoir partially filled with water. The zero level of the\nreservoir corresponds to the total soil water content at the wilting point for a soil layer\ncorresponding to the maximum root depth. The maximum volume of the reservoir is the\nmaximum soil available water. Therefore, the actual water volume in the reservoir is the\nactual soil available water. The reservoir is filled with water from precipitation and\ndischarged by crop transpiration. Should the water in the reservoir exceed the maximum\nreservoir volume, a second reservoir starts to fill. The water in this reservoir is the soil\ndrainable water. The second reservoir is also discharged by drainage flow and evaporation\nand a threshold defines the wet water content limit at which the soil is defined as not\nworkable.\nThe dynamics of the water budget elements (evaporation, transpiration, drainage)\nare computed using the Thornthwaite-Mathers approach (Thornthwaite, 1957) if the\nsoil water content is less than the maximum available water, and the travel time\napproach (Lane, 1989) for drainage flow calculations for soil water contents greater\nthan the maximum available water. The algorithm shares total actual evapotranspiration\nbetween evaporation and crop transpiration using Ritchie\u2019s formula (Ritchie, 1972). Thus, the\ndynamics of the leaf area index (LAI) is the central driving process for soil water dynamics\nduring the vegetation period and for biomass calculations. The dynamics of LAI is computed\nusing the maximum LAI and an analytical function (Wight, 1987, lairgc(i)) relating the\nrelative LAI (LAI\/maximum LAI) to the values of the development stage. Maximum LAI is\nestimated using an iterative technique matching the values of total cumulated crop\ntranspiration with the water supply during the vegetation period (available water at\nemergence + precipitation during the vegetation period). Maximum LAI is first changed\nby a fixed step. The evaporation and transpiration are computed for the new value of LAI and\nthe water balance evaluated. If water supply is different from water extraction (evaporation +\ntranspiration + drainage) then a new value of maximum LAI is considered until the difference\nis less than a threshold. Therefore, an overall water balance is achieved.\n6Each SMU polygon is associated with the climate data corresponding to the closest grid point\nto its label point (weight centre of the polygon). ROIMPEL dynamically calculates the state\nvariables with a time step of 1 day. The data available from the European scale grids have a\ntime step of 1 month. Therefore, ROIMPEL uses functions to derive daily weather data (air\ntemperature, precipitation, radiation) from monthly values. These are either trend functions\nfor temperature and radiation derived from monthly values and a distribution of rainfall events\nbased on the average days with rain for each site, or the LARS weather data generator\n(Semenov, 1997) for site specific simulations where a long series of daily weather exists for\ncalibration.\nA screening of soil\/climate conditions to evaluate the land suitability for a given crop is first\nperformed. For suitable land, the daily dynamics of the crop development stages up to\nharvest, are simulated for each crop. The accumulation of biomass is based on the radiation\nuse efficiency and the net photosynthetic active radiation. The radiation use efficiency is CO2\nconcentration sensitive. This potential daily biomass increase is corrected by temperature,\nwater and nitrogen stresses. Additional penalties on crop yields are included through alarm\ncriteria (unfavourable weather parameters during the most sensitive development stages)\nbased on the crop specific physiology. Unfavourable weather is linked mainly to\ntemperatures: for each development stage temperatures lower\/higher than a threshold. The\nvalues of these parameters are derived from MARS series of works (1990-1992). Grass crop\nyields are calculated for each fortnight.\nThe model was derived against data from Romania and then validated against data from\nBulgaria for 1980-1993 and Czech Republic for 1995-1998, in comparison with CERES\nwhich uses more detailed input data. Figure 1 shows the comparison of data for the Bulgaria\ncase. The results show ROIMPEL performs adequately and as well CERES, but illustrate\nthat some experimental data contains other issues than just soil moisture.\n[Figure 1]\nCalculation of sowing dates is crucial. The algorithm for calculating sowing dates has two\nstages. First for each year of simulation, the latest\/earliest possible day is computed from\nweather data for winter\/spring crops based on threshold temperature and the accumulation of\ndegree-days between sowing and emergence. The emergence day needs to be before freezing\nfor winter crops; for spring crops a threshold temperature drives the possible day. The sowing\ndate (which is the same for all years of simulation) is then defined as the 9th decile of the\nordered set of simulated possible dates.\n2.3.2 Farm model (SFARMMOD)\nInput data\nThe model uses input from three sources: details of husbandry provided by a farm database,\ndetails which are a function of the soil and climate provided by ROIMPEL, details of future\neconomics provided by the scenario database.\nA common farm database is used for all countries in the EU (the countries are defined in table\n1). An analysis of the operations to produce a range of crops throughout the EU showed that\nall countries use largely the same methods. The database includes crop characteristics,\nstandard crop yields as a function of soil type, soil workability requirements of operations,\nmachinery\/labour requirement as a function of soil type, rotational constraints and irrigation\nrequirements, crop prices, variable inputs and costs (seed\/fertiliser) and subsidies\/area\n7payments as a function of the regional base yield. In order to speed up the analysis, the list of\ncrops was reduced to crop \u2018types\u2019 by eliminating crops that have similar characteristics of\nsowing, harvesting or rotational benefit. The constants in the model were calculated as\nfollows:\n\uf0b7 crop price (P) was taken from the database for the baseline. A study of prices across\nthe EU showed that differences were small and inconsistent. In some cases there were\ndifferences between regions in production surplus versus in production deficit, and in\nregions near to population centres, but not in others. Thus no differences were used.\n\uf0b7 yield (Y) for each soil (and its variation between years) was taken from the crop\nmodel, after eliminating polygons on the basis of slope and climate and those with\ninsufficient degree days. Tests indicated problems caused by high yields of cereals in\nwet areas and grass in dry areas where they would not be expected. This was attributed\nto the crop model being only a soil moisture model and not considering factors such as\ndisease in cereals and the unreliability of summer grass growth in dry areas. Therefore\nadjustments were made by reducing yields where the summer precipitation was greater\nthan the summer evaporation and where the standard deviation of yield was high.\nAnalysis of Greece showed that yields of crops such as unirrigated maize were low\nand the water management settings in the soil database were used to select irrigated\nsoils. In spite of these changes, the yields, and comparative yields such as barley\nversus wheat, generally did not agree with the average crop yields for the NUTS2\nregions reported in the REGIO database (REGIO, 2001). Therefore a regional scaling\nfactor was determined by comparing the average yield of each crop on likely arable\nsoils to the REGIO yield. Care is needed where the REGIO average represents more\nthan one type of crop (e.g. spring and winter cereals). Typically the factors were found\nto be close to 1.0 for northern countries, but 0.8 for barley, 0.7 for oilseed rape, and\nlower for other countries.\n\uf0b7 variable costs (V) were adjusted to take account of yield and irrigation.\n\uf0b7 cost of men and machinery (C) were modified by country as labour costs are much\nlower in southern than northern European countries. In CEECs, labour costs and input\nand output costs are lower than in the EU15. Three factors were defined therefore for\nall countries and used to modify the costs. In the future scenarios, only labour cost\ndifferences remain and are reduced by the scenario convergence parameter.\n\uf0b7 timeliness penalties (T) reflect the timing of sowing and harvest. A detailed sowing\ndate analysis led to a procedure to calculate climate and region specific sowing\nwindows for individual spring\/winter sown crops, based on the date after\/before which\nlow temperatures rarely occurred. The analysis (Fig.2) showed differences of up to\ntwo months between individual countries, which were strongly correlated with the\nseverity of the winter conditions. Countries with a more severe winter such as\nNorthern European countries and those with the pronounced effect of a continental\nclimate (typically Czech Republic or Hungary) tend to close the sowing season of\nwinter crops by the end of October whilst the spring crops are generally sown from\nMarch till May. On the other hand in southern countries or those with maritime\nclimate (typically UK) the sowing of winter crops is possible until the end of\nDecember whilst some spring crops are sown as early as January. Note however that\nin countries such as southern Spain, \u2018winter\u2019 wheat is in fact \u2018spring\u2019 wheat (no\nvernalisation requirement) grown over winter. In the case of some crops (e.g. sugar\nbeet or potatoes) the recommended sowing dates are similar throughout the EU. For\nwinter-sown crops, the crop model defined the latest sowing date, and the start date\nwas defined by the database. The length of the operation and the timeliness penalties\nwere reduced to this range so that there were high penalties for sowing close to the\n8latest date. For spring-sown crops, the crop model defined the earliest sowing date\nand the database the latest. The start of the harvest operation in the database was\nmoved to the date of maturity calculated by the crop model, plus a fortnight. An\nanalysis of actual harvest dates was used to verify the crop model performance.\n[Figure 2]\n\uf0b7 labour and machinery requirements (L) were modified for yield and soil type. Thus\nfor harvesting there was a minimum requirement and an increase proportional to yield.\nMost other workrates were fixed as a function of soil type.\n\uf0b7 workable hours in a period (H) were calculated by the model\u2019s soil workability\nformula (Tillett, 1987, originally derived for England) which requires a soil index\nvalue and annual precipitation. The soil index value was derived from the soil textures\nover the profile including impermeable layers as specified in the soil database.\nPrecipitation, mm in the original formula, which implicitly includes the average\nevaporation in England, was modified to be 435+Annual (Precipitation-Evaporation).\nThis method was preferred to the output of the crop model.\nSeveral crops (such as forage maize) were not modelled by the crop model. Equivalent crops\n(e.g. spring wheat) were defined and sowing, harvest and yield values modified for other sites\nand climates by the same amount as the equivalent crop. For sowing and harvest, the \u2018same\namount\u2019 was based on temperature level. A temperature sine wave was fitted for East Anglia\nand used to convert the database dates to temperatures. Thus if the latest sowing date changes\naccording to the crop model, from the database value of day 360 to the site value of day 300,\nthen, for the equivalent non-modelled crop, if the database value is 330, then the site value is\n287. Thus a month\u2019s delay in sowing in February of the equivalent crop equates to a shorter\ndelay in April.\nOutput data\nThe output of the model is the optimum cropping percentage for each soil in each soil\npolygon and the profit. Each soil must then be classified as intensive, extensive or\nabandoned. Data from REGIO lists the area of each NUTS2, the area that is agriculture,\npermanent grass, arable land, and arable land-green fodder, mostly at the NUTS2 level.\nComparing the output profits with this REGIO data, it was clear that a single profit threshold\nfor all countries is not satisfactory and that there are large areas of low-profit land classified\nas agriculture because they are grazed. In some countries, such as Belgium, there was no\nsuitable threshold and the area of high profit soils apparently available to agriculture was\nconsiderably greater than the actual area of agriculture. In these cases a standard threshold of\n\u20ac350\/ha was used, and a proportion of the land was defined as not available for agriculture\n(termed \u201cpseudo-urban\u201d), both now and in the future. Each country was therefore analysed as\nfollows:\n1. Determine the proportion of each polygon in each NUTS2 and of each Pelcom land type.\n2. Remove the urban proportion in each NUTS2 pro-rata from all soil polygons.\n3. Define areas with a profit above the threshold e.g. \u20ac350\/ha, as intensive agriculture and\ncalculate the total grass\/fodder and arable areas.\n[Figure 3]\n4. If there is too much agricultural land, define the surplus to be \u2018urban\u2019 and remove pro-rata.\n95. If there is too little agricultural land (e.g. UK), calculate a second threshold above which\nland is grazed and, which minimises the error in the arable percentages in each NUTS2.\n6. Define all other land as \u2018abandoned\u2019. Note that this does not mean not used and could be\nforestry or grazing such as sheep on moorland or goat herds.\n7. For the future climate change and socio-economic scenarios: remove the increased urban\nland defined by the scenario and then allocate non-\u2018urban\u2019 soils to the three classes based\non their profit. Compute the percentage change between classes and percentage arable\nversus grass.\n2.4 Future scenarios\n2.4.1 Climate\nClimate scenarios for 2050 were derived from the recent HADCM3 and PCM climate model\noutputs for 2001-2100 (Mitchell et al., 2004). Rounsevell et al. and Harrison et al. describe\nhow the scenarios were constructed and describe the patterns for temperature and\nprecipitation. HadCM3 and PCM were the extremes of the 4 climate models in terms of both\ntemperature and precipitation change. Four SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios;\nNaki\u0107enovi\u0107 et al., 2000) emission scenarios were used within the HadCM3 climate model:\nA1FI, A2, B1, B2 and one \u2013 for the PCM climate model - A2. The most severe changes in\nclimate occur under the HadCM3 model simulations. As illustrated in table 2, the differences\nare much greater between climate models than between scenarios within models. The PCM\nA2 climate model shows lower increases in air temperature and precipitation changes are\nsmaller. (See figures 4 and 5).\n[Table 2]\n[Figure 4]\n[Figure 5]\n2.4.2 Socio-economics\nSocio-economic data for the future are derived and detailed in Abildtrup et al. (2005). Four\nscenarios were created, which are based on A1, A2, B1, B2 respectively, but contain much\nmore agricultural detail:\n\uf0b7 World Market (WM),\n\uf0b7 Regional Enterprise (RE),\n\uf0b7 Global Sustainability (GS),\n\uf0b7 Local Stewardship (LS).\nThese define percentage changes in: a) costs of the most important production inputs; b)\nprices of agricultural commodities; c) subsidies; d) yields due to technology; e) natural\nresources available for agricultural production; f) efficiency of natural resource use; g)\nchemical input restrictions. Variable costs (V) were adjusted for scenarios. Changes to the\ninput costs relative to crop price affect the amount used. Increasing the price of pesticides by\n100% reduces use to 60% and yield by 2.5%. In the environmental scenarios it was assumed\nthat this yield reduction would be eliminated by technology. Increasing the price of N by\n100% reduces the amount of N applied by 9% and yield by 1.6%.\nLand use change was estimated for the climate scenarios alone, with only the prices changed\nto correct production (+FP), and for the combined climate with socio-economic scenarios.\nThe SRES framework allows the climate and socio-economic scenarios to be combined in an\ninternally-consistent way, as the underpinning socio-economic assumptions drive GHG\n10\nemissions and therefore climate change. Where a climate change scenario was coupled with\nits corresponding socio-economic scenario, these are given as A1FI+WM, A2+RE, B1+GS\nand B2+LS.\nDirectly modifying the prices as specified in the scenario analysis led to wild variations in the\ntotal production of commodities. With a future scenario, a subset of the database was run\niteratively and the commodity prices adjusted to generate increases in total production similar\nto those required by the SRES storyline. This approach was satisfactory in most cases, except\nin the A1FI+WM scenario, when the full run had too many potatoes. As a result, this scenario\nalso shows high levels of arable rather than grass, but due to the very high productivity, less\nagricultural land is required. In all cases, soya increases enormously from a low base level\ndue to increasing suitability. The resulting production increases are given in Table 3.\n[Table 3]\nThe scenario data were based on countries in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). For\nCentral and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), a separate database for current socio-\neconomics was used with the current climate, but the common EU data were applied to all\ncountries in 2050.\n3. Results\n3.1 Baseline\nFigure 6 compares the proportion of arable cropping listed in the REGIO database for the\nEU15 versus that predicted by the model, plotted by NUTS2 region. Not all countries have\ndata at the NUTS2 level and some have been reorganised so that the location on the map does\nnot match the REGIO data. Overall the prediction is satisfactory, although some NUTS2\nregions such as NUTS2=13 (Antwerpen) in Belgium, southern France and Italy are\nproblematic.\n[Figure 6]\nFor the Czech Republic, a qualitative comparison evaluated the capability of the model to\ndepict the productive capacity of individual regions within the country (Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b).\nThe overall profitability simulated by the SFARMMOD model expects that higher profits will\nbe generated in the north-central and eastern part of the country. It also indicated profitable\nagriculture at the south-west close to the Bavarian border. These results were compared with\nthe map of the official prices of agricultural land in the Czech Republic (designed for taxation\npurposes). The price map was developed for each cadastral unit and the official price was\ncalculated as a function of the expected profitability of crop production on individual soil-\nclimate units within each cadastral. The potential profitability of each soil unit was corrected\nby factors including e.g. aspect, slope or soil depth. The final price for each cadastral was\ndefined as the mean of prices of all soil units present within the cadastral weighted according\nto their proportion in the area. (N\u011bmec, 2001). The expected profitability was based on an\nextensive statistical survey of the individual farms in combination with very detailed soil\nsurveys and represents the agricultural potential of individual plots rather well. It should be\nnoted that Fig 7b does not take account of other factors affecting prices, e.g. distance from\nurban centres (which increases the official price), restrictions due to environmental pollution\nor the location of the cadastral within protected natural reserves or drinking water reservoirs\netc.\n11\n[Figure 7a]\n[Figure 7b]\nWhen Fig. 7a and 7b are compared, it is apparent that the model depicted the most productive\nregions well (i.e. those with the highest official price in Fig 7b). Part of the differences\nbetween the model and observation can be explained by the much lower spatial resolution of\nthe European-level soil map, which did not include all factors that limit agricultural\nproduction (e.g. high groundwater levels, unsuitable slope and aspect etc.). It should also be\nnoted that the crop yields simulated by ROIMPEL do not always correlate closely with the\nobservation. Given these caveats, the results of the model are surprisingly good and\nqualitatively comparable to those obtained with the significantly more detailed map of official\nprices.\nAt the same time the percentage of arable land predicted in individual Czech NUTS2 regions\ncompared well to the real world data (with the exception of a few SMU polygons), as well as\nthe overall percentage of cereals, forage and technical crops. However the model showed a\nrelatively high area of soybeans in the Czech Republic of which there is currently a very\nlimited area (2700ha, Czech Statistical Office, 2002), despite the fact that the crop has been\ngrown for a quite long time in Austria. This time lag between a new crop becoming profitable\nand being accepted is typical as there is a need for experience, technology and farmer-buyer\nlinks. Such a time lag also occurred when sunflowers began to be grown in 1982, but took\nover 10 years to reach their present acreage (\u017di\u017elavsk\u00e1, 1998). The model is a steady-state and\nnot a dynamic model and therefore is unable to distinguish between crops that are profitable\nand well established and crops that are profitable and new. It indicates the situation after\nprofit-driven changes have occurred. Some changes could take decades to be realised if they\nrequire large amounts of capital expenditure.\n3.2 Future yield changes\nTable 4 shows changes in the average simulated yield of crops in representative NUTS2\nregions of the EU15 between the current and the HadCM3 A2 climate in 2050. Although\nbroadly an accurate representation of the results, it must be borne in mind that these averages\ninclude low yields in areas where the crop would never be grown. As might be anticipated\ncrop suitability increases in the north, and thus in some northern regions, attainable yield\nincreases are large. Crops currently grown in the south also become suitable further north.\nThe results are too numerous to list them all, but they follow what one would expect from the\ngiven climates. Crop yield changes in the CEECs show similar patterns to the EU15.\nIncreases in yield are observed in the northern latitude CEECs, with decreases in the\nMediterranean regions and the south west Balkans. Crop yield decreases in southern Europe\nare greater for spring-sown crops such as maize, sunflower and soybeans. The different\nclimate scenarios produce different ranges of crop yield changes. The largest changes (both\ndecreases in the south and increases in the north) are for the A1FI scenarios. The A2, B1 and\nB2 scenarios have similar effects on crop yields.\n[Table 4]\n3.3 Scenario Output\nTable 5 shows the total area of agriculture in each country for the different scenarios. It is\nevident that the effect of different climates (+FP columns) is relatively small, whereas there\nare large variations when the socio-economic scenarios are included. Only Finland responds\nsignificantly to climate by increasing the agricultural area. One climate consistently shows a\n12\ndifferent level of response - PCM A2 climate change scenario. In several countries there is\nmore difference due to the climate model than due to the emission scenario. The WM\nscenario causes a general reduction in agricultural area due to the large increase in yields.\nThe LS scenario is perhaps the most interesting as it cancels out the climate increases in\nFinland and Sweden. The main features of this scenario are that input costs are high and yield\nincreases are low so, although prices are high, marginal areas have low gross margins\ncompared to highly productive regions and the profit level is not sufficient to justify a switch\ninto agriculture.\n[Table 5]\nOne might think that Sweden and Finland would show comparable behaviour. However\nstudying the climate and thus the crop yields, the south of Sweden is very similar to Denmark\nand good for agriculture whereas the north is cold and remains quite cold even in the A1FI\nscenario. Finland although appearing well north of much of Sweden has a much warmer\nsummer and, although barely suitable for winter wheat currently, a huge area of Finland gives\nhigher yields of wheat than the south of Sweden in the A1FI climate. Therefore whereas the\nagricultural area in Sweden doubles, the area in Finland increases ten-fold.\nFigure 8 shows how the proportion of arable cropping within the agricultural area changes\nwith a future climate, and compares the output from the two GCMs HadCM3 and PCM for\nthe A2 emission scenario with no change in socio-economics. There are considerable\ndifferences, usually associated with precipitation. For example in the HadCM3 climate,\nprecipitation in the Ardennes is reduced and with increases in air temperature the area\nbecomes arable whereas in the PCM climate, precipitation is high and the area remains grass.\nThe difference between the PCM and HadCM3 climate change scenarios is visible in several\ncountries, with PCM generally having lower changes and thus less change to arable\nagriculture. The Republic of Ireland is probably the only exception to the increasing\nproportion of arable agriculture, but this is due to the increased area in viable agriculture - the\narable area still increases.\n[Figure 8]\nThe main cropping changes are the relatively large proportion (6%) of soya in Austria with all\n2050 scenarios and similarly in Germany, cropping switches to grain maize with some soya.\nIn Denmark, grain maize becomes a minor crop and in A2+RE and B1+GS there is a huge\nswitch away from arable to forage maize. In the Netherlands, the PCM climate change\nscenario has notably less grain maize due to the lower increases in air temperatures in this\nscenario compared with HadCM3.\nThe model assumes irrigation is available where the soils database indicates that soils are\nirrigated. In several scenarios in Spain, there is no reduction in land use, although there is a\ngeneral reduction in livestock and grass in all scenarios. Because the model did not impose\nany limit on water use, this may represent unsustainable level of extraction of water for\nirrigation, and needs further study.\nFor the A1FI emission scenario, intensive land use increases at higher latitudes (i.e. in\nScandinavia, especially southern Finland) and also at higher altitudes (i.e. Trentino, Italy) due\nto the beneficial effects of warming. Decreases in intensification occur at lower latitudes (i.e.\nsouth west France, Spain, Portugal and Italy), where higher air temperatures and increased\n13\naridity have a negative effect on farm profitability. Some mid-latitude regions (i.e. the\nsouthern UK, southern Belgium, Luxembourg and parts of Germany) also show strong\ndecreases in intensification. The trends for the A2 emission scenario are similar to A1FI, with\nhigh latitude and altitude areas becoming more intensive. However, A2 shows more\nintensification everywhere, which can be explained by the higher prices, subsidies and much\nlower labour costs assumed for the RE scenario compared with the WM scenario. Parts of\nsouthern Europe (notably southern Italy and Portugal) even become more intensive compared\nwith the baseline, which is the opposite situation to the A1FI emission scenario. This can be\nexplained by the different spatial patterns of climate change in the A2 emission scenario.\nAbandonment again tends to occur in marginal agricultural areas and is at its greatest in the\nA2 emission scenario.\nTable 5 shows that intensification in the B1 emission scenario increases slightly almost\neverywhere, including southern Europe, although southern Finland and southern Italy again\nshow the biggest increases. This probably reflects the slightly higher levels of commodity\nprices, the less severe climatic change and the technological gains for crop yields. As a\nconsequence abandonment is less important for the B1 emission scenario compared with the\nother scenarios and farmers on the whole would enjoy relatively good levels of profitability.\nIntensification in the B2 emission scenario is quite different from the other scenarios.\nScandinavia no longer has increased intensification, whereas southern Europe (with the\nexception of northern Italy) does. Southern France, Portugal and the north and west of the UK\nshow the greatest increases in intensification. This reflects the patterns of climate change for\nthe A2 emission scenario with northern latitudes not becoming sufficiently warm for intensive\nagriculture to be profitable. Yield gains due to technological development are assumed to be\nthe lowest for this scenario, and this strongly affects profitability.\n4. Discussion\n4.1 Present\nThis analysis has brought together several models and attempted to apply them over a very\nwide range of situations in terms of soils, climates and economics. This very severe test has\nindicated a number of areas where further work is required to explain observed differences in\nfarmer behaviour.\nThe crop model is a soil moisture model and thus does not include the impact of pests and\ndiseases on yield and thus without the regional adjustments, appears to over-predict yield in\nwestern maritime regions (Landau et al, 1998). The suitability section under-predicted the\nareas of Finland that currently can grow crops to maturity. This suggests a need to adapt\nvarieties of all crops to regions and not just for grain maize. A detailed study of Greece also\nsuggested there were problems with predicting where grain maize could and could not be\ngrown successfully. Comparison with statistics on grain yields suggested that many crops\u2019\nyields were not correct. This was particularly true of spring cereals and oilseed rape. Grass\nyield also seemed to be very high in hot countries although measures are not as easily\navailable as grain crops. Some of these differences could be due to low levels of fertiliser\ninput (assumed to be optimal), which the model could simulate if the level was known, or a\nsoil factor such as pH, which the model could not. It is known that in dry areas, less fertiliser\nis applied because of the lower expected yield, but since the model simulates soil moisture\nthis should be implicit.\nSeveral prediction errors occurred where grass was the predominant crop rather than arable.\nThe most likely cause is that the profitability of arable was over estimated (relative to grass).\n14\nOther than yield, this could be due to quality, input costs or workability. In wetter regions the\nincreased costs of drying and disease control would reduce the crop gross margin. The\ndifferences in these factors with region were not modelled. Soil workability was modelled \u2013\nperhaps or perhaps not successfully \u2013 but cereal harvest workability is not a function of soil\nworkability. The method used here included an effect of weather on harvest workability, but\nmay not be sufficient for all regions across Europe.\nFarm profitability could also be affected by different labour costs, different distances to the\nmarket and whether the region is in surplus or deficit. Labour costs were adjusted for\ncountry, but are also likely to reduce with distance from large cities, which would increase the\nviable agriculture predicted in rural areas. Bulky and perishable products such as milk are\nalso likely to have a higher price near to cities than in remote areas, increasing the\nattractiveness of grass versus arable.\nClearly history also has an effect as farmers do not make major changes such as dairy to\narable immediately, because the profitability and hence difference is very variable. Price is\nvery variable and although attempts were made to use the price averaged over several years, it\ntends to represent more the current trend in price. Thus a current prediction of arable farming\nat a location may be a reflection of a trend that is happening or a transient view of the best\noption. In addition quota and subsidy systems such as the CAP milk quota and arable area\npayments, restrict change. However such systems are themselves transient in the context of\nthe timescale of a climate change study.\n4.2 Future\nThe major climate trends are quite clearly the northward march of arable farming, but there is\nalso an increase in the same regions in the viability of grassland farming. There is some\nreduction in profitability in the southern areas. However in between these areas, the largest\ndifferences are not due to climate change. In these areas, differences result from the climate\nmodels \u2013 with the Ardennes being the major example of predominantly arable in one climate\nscenario and grass in another. Socio-economic scenarios are shown to have an even larger\neffect on land use.\nAll scenarios tend to increase the level of European production, through a combination of the\nfertilising effect of CO2 and new areas becoming suitable. Setting the price of commodities\nwithin scenarios was found to produce unrealistic levels of production of commodities, with\nlevels varying between none at all and treble. Therefore prices were set by an iterative\nmechanism, which approximately allowed increases in production appropriate for a scenario.\nSeveral of the differences may also reflect the inaccuracy of this mechanism. However given\nthe long run times required, a better method was not found. Possible alternative methods\ncould include fitting a meta-model to the linear programme model, which could then be used\nin a formal optimisation. It is clear that the socio-economic scenarios should define the future\nlevel of production and not the price of commodities. The economic scenario cannot know\nthe changes in yields due to climate and soil and the resulting changes in relative gross\nmargins between crops and possible production space, which can generate huge changes in\ntotal production. If a given price generates either a huge surplus or virtual absence of a\ncommodity, this is unsustainable in reality and the only realistic alternative is to adjust the\nscenario price. Thus it is better to fix a target scenario production and allow the price to be\nadjusted to meet this target.\n15\nThe main effects of both climate and socio-economics were in the margins of Europe. In\ncentral areas, there were relatively few changes. This agrees with experience in the Czech\nRepublic. After 1989, the CEEC\u00b4s underwent major changes in their economies and the\nwhole system of financing and profitability collapsed. In the Czech Republic, the present\nstock of beef and pork is about half of 1989 levels. However, the percentage of arable land\nhas decreased only slightly and the overall structure of crops has not changed much. This\nsuggests that the environmental suitability rather than socio-economics will drive future land\nuse, as is shown in Sweden compared with Finland.\nOne of the conclusions of the model for Finland is that large areas will become intensive\nagriculture \u2013 in the scenarios that need the land to meet demand, though not in the scenarios\nwhere central Europe can meet the demand. Currently these areas of Finland are forests. This\nmodel differs from some other models of land use, which start by defining and even\nexpanding the areas of forest in the future (e.g. Nabuurs, et al., 2000), although this assumes\nthat intensive arable agriculture will always be more profitable than forestry. This is an\nimportant use of the model as it indicates the situations where forests will come under threat\nfrom agricultural expansion.\nIt is a policy matter as to which land use will be defended. In most countries there are\nforested (and non-forested) areas that are protected by various environmental designations,\noften from urban development as much as agriculture. Where land is not suitable for other\nuses at present, it may or may not be protected. In the future if arable agriculture becomes\nvery profitable, there will be pressure to change. Not changing might be good for the\nenvironment (is 10% loss of Finnish forests significant?), whereas changing to a substantial\nexporter of cereals might be good for the Finnish economy. EU-wide this might represent a\nsurplus of cereals. In fact several of the scenarios indicate that although feasible in Finland,\nlow product prices due to the higher level of production, mean that cereals are not grown in\nFinland.\nScenario modelling has therefore identified several regions where there is a need to be\nwatchful, such as Finland\u2019s forests and precipitation in the Ardennes. There are, however,\nfew areas where all of the scenario results agree. Scenario modelling has not been able to\nidentify any common (convergent) futures, although in general in central Europe, changes are\nlikely to be relatively small. This implies, however, that no action is required to adapt land\nuse to climate change in these areas, which is useful information for policy. The biggest\nclimate-driven differences are between climate models rather than climate scenarios, which\nplaces a worryingly large range to the conclusions from climate impact modelling. In all\nthese areas therefore, the levels of uncertainty suggest that European agricultural policy\nmakers should wait for clearer changes in the climate leading to more agreement among\nclimate modellers.\n5. Conclusion\nA method for determining agricultural land use over all of Europe was shown to predict many\nagricultural areas correctly at a NUTS2 regional level, but to fail in other regions, particularly\nwhere there were features not associated with conventional arable farming in northern Europe.\nTrends in farming under climate change were clear. Policy will need to choose between\nforestry and arable agriculture in the northern regions of Europe. Conversely there is no need\nfor action in the majority of central Europe where the combination of increased production\nand reduced prices will leave agricultural areas largely unchanged. Of particular note were the\ndifferences purely due to differences between climate models, which were particularly\n16\napparent in current farming regions. In these cases (e.g. Ardennes) policy actions should\nawait more climate knowledge. Socio-economic scenarios generate larger changes than\nclimate scenarios though there is a need to refine the methods for defining self-consistent\nscenarios. Policy therefore may need to react more to future socio-economic changes than\nclimate changes.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was carried out as part of the ACCELERATES project, which was funded by the\nEuropean Commission Research Directorate General (EVK2-CT-2000-00061).
