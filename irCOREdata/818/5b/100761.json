The breakup kinematics were used to reconstruct the 10C \u2192 9B +p, 9B \u2192 8Be +p, 8Be \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1\nand 10C \u2192 6Be +\u03b1, 6Be \u2192 5Li +p, 5Li \u2192 \u03b1 + p decay paths. Proton emission was seen to be favored. The\ndecay of excited states at Ex = 4.20, 5.31, and 6.74 MeV was observed. The previously unobserved state at 4.20\nMeV may correspond to a J \u03c0 = 0+\u03b1 + 2p + \u03b1 cluster structure.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.77.021301 PACS number(s): 23.50.+z, 23.60.+e, 25.60.\u2212t, 27.20.+n\nThe Borromean systems have been the subject of much\ninterest in recent years. These are a class of nuclei that may be\ndescribed in terms of a three-body structure, with the property\nthat the removal of any one of the three constituents results in\nan unbound two-body subsystem [1]. Perhaps the best known\nexample is 11Li, which is believed to possess a dominant 9Li +\nn + n structure in its ground state. The two-body subsystems,\n10Li (9Li + n) and the di-neutron (n + n), are unbound by\n25 and 66 keV, respectively. All three bodies are therefore\nrequired to produce the overall bound nuclear system. As such\nthe structure of the Borromean nuclei provides a stringent test\nof nuclear few-body models.\nThere is only one known example of a four-body nucleus\nthat has Borromean-like properties: 10C, which may be\ndescribed as \u03b1 + \u03b1 + p + p. This nucleus has the property\nthat the removal of any one of the four constituents results in an\nunbound three-body system. The removal of a proton from 10C\nleads to 9B, which is unbound to 8Be + p decay by 185 keV.\nThe removal of an \u03b1 particle produces 6Be. Although the Q\nvalue for 5Li + p decay is \u2212595 keV, 6Be is unbound to\nthis channel due to the \u223c1.5 MeV width of the 5Li ground\nstate. In addition, the removal of any two particles from 10C\nresults in an unbound two-body system. The removal of both\nprotons produces 8Be (unbound to \u03b1 + \u03b1 decay by 92 keV),\none \u03b1 particle and one proton results in 5Li (unbound to \u03b1 + p\ndecay by 1967 keV) and the removal of both \u03b1 particles would\nproduce the di-proton (unbound to p + p decay by 93 keV).\nAll four constituents must be present to bind the system,\nand 10C may therefore be described as a \u201cSuper-Borromean\u201d\nnucleus. In fact 10C is the only known nuclear example of a\nfourth-order Brunnian link [2], a nontrivial link in knot theory\nthat becomes trivial if any component is removed. Three-body\nBorromean nuclei are examples of third-order Brunnian links.\nThe aim of this experiment was to study the spectroscopy of\n10C and to determine the relative strengths of the \u03b1 and proton\n*n.curtis@bham.ac.uk\ndecay channels: 10C \u2192 9B +p, 9B \u2192 8Be +p, 8Be \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1\nand 10C \u2192 6Be +\u03b1, 6Be \u2192 5Li +p, 5Li \u2192 \u03b1 + p. The\nexperiment was performed at the GANIL accelerator facility.\nA 33.3 MeV\/nucleon 10C beam was produced following the\nfragmentation of a 60 MeV\/nucleon 12C primary beam in a\n3-mm-thick Be production target. The secondary beam was\npurified to 98.6% 10C using the LISE3 spectrometer and\nhad an average intensity of 2.5 \u00d7 104 particles per second.\nThe beam contaminants (observed in the detector telescope)\nwere d(0.2%), 3He (0.3%), and 4He (0.9%) at 24.2, 40.4, and\n22.3 MeV\/nucleon, respectively (corresponding to the same\nmagnetic rigidity as the 10C). The beam was not identified on\nan event by event basis, but as the contaminants were all light\nparticles they could not give rise to the multiple proton and\n\u03b1-particle channels of interest. The contaminants were only\nobserved in singles events in the detector array, and not in\ndouble, triple, or quadruple coincidences. Therefore the 4He\ncontaminant did not contribute to the detection of \u03b1 particles\nfrom any of the breakup channels considered. The beam was\ntracked onto the reaction target (20, 45, and 95 mg\/cm2 12C\nfoils were used) on an event by event basis using a position-\nsensitive drift chamber. A 5-mm-thick, 10-mm-diameter, Ta\nbeam stop was positioned 106 mm (downstream) from the\ntarget. This protected the detector telescope, which was placed\nat 0\u25e6 (on the beam axis), from the direct and small angle\nscattered 10C beam. The beam stop was held in place by a\n3-mm-diameter rod.\nThe detector telescope consisted of four separate elements,\neach (50 \u00d7 50) mm2 in active area. The first two elements,\nat 123 and 130 mm from the target, respectively, were\nsilicon resistive strip detectors (RSD). Each RSD was 500 \u00b5m\nthick and segmented into 16 independent 3-mm-wide strips.\nResistive charge division provided position information along\nthe strip length. The strips on the front detector (RSD1) were\nvertical and those on the second (RSD2) horizontal. The\nthird element was a 1000-\u00b5m-thick silicon double-sided strip\ndetector (DSSD) placed 148 mm from the target. This was\nsegmented into 32 independent 3-mm-wide strips, with 16\nhorizontal strips on the front face and 16 vertical strips on the\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(2)\/021301(5) 021301-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nN. CURTIS et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 021301(R) (2008)\nback face. The final element, 160 mm from the target, was an\narray of 64 CsI scintillators, each 20 mm thick and with an\narea of (6 \u00d7 6) mm2. The effective solid angle covered by the\narray, calculated as the difference between the coverage of the\nCsI detectors and the beam stop and mounting rod, was 85\nmsr. Used in combination, the four detectors provided \u0003E-E\nparticle identification with isotopic separation for H, He, and\nLi ions. The highly segmented nature of the array allowed all\nfour particles from the decay of 10C (\u03b1 + \u03b1 + p + p) to be\ndetected in coincidence. Position resolution for the \u03b1 particles\nwas \u223c1 mm (FWHM) in both X and Y (provided by RSD1\nand RSD2). Because the proton energy loss in these detectors\nwas minimal, the position resolution for these particles was\nlimited to the 3-mm strip pitch of the DSSD.\nThe telescope was calibrated using an \u03b1-particle source and\na secondary \u201ccocktail\u201d beam of mixed isotopes at five different\nmagnetic rigidity settings of the LISE3 spectrometer. These\ncovered the energy range of interest. The (FWHM) energy\nresolution was \u223c200 keV for the silicon detectors and \u223c1.5%\nfor the CsI crystals. The average detector counting rates were\n3.5 kHz (summed total for the 16 strips of RSD1), 4.3 kHz\n(summed total for the 16 strips of RSD2), 1.4 kHz (summed\ntotal for the 16 front and 16 back strips of the DSSD), and\n190 Hz (summed total for the 64 CsI crystals). The higher\nrates in RSD1 and RSD2 reflect the flux of heavy isotopes (in\nthis case Be and heavier) that were stopped in these detectors\nand not in the DSSD or CsI array. The average data acquisition\nrate, triggered by events where three or more CsI crystals were\nactive, was 140 Hz.\nEvents were selected for analysis based on the particle mul-\ntiplicity (M) in the DSSD. Three categories were considered:\nM = 3(\u03b1\u03b1p),M = 3(\u03b1pp), and M = 4(\u03b1\u03b1pp). The decay\nenergy (Edecay) for each channel was reconstructed from the\nkinetic energies and momenta of the decay fragments:Pparent =\u2211n\ni=1 Pfragmenti (n being the number of decay fragments),\nEparent = P2parent\/2mparent (where mparent is the mass of the\ndecaying parent nucleus) and Edecay = (\n\u2211n\ni=1 Efragmenti ) \u2212\nEparent. The decay energy is related to the excitation energy\n(Ex) of the decaying nucleus via Ex = Edecay \u2212 Qn, where\nQn is the n-body decay Q value. This approach allows the\nexcitation energy of a decaying nucleus to be determined\nwithout considering any intermediate (sequential) decay steps.\nFor example, the excitation energy of 9B may be obtained\ndirectly from the kinetic energies and momenta of the \u03b1 +\n\u03b1 + p decay fragments, without first reconstructing the initial\np + 8Be decay. In this case mparent is assumed to be 9, and Q3,\nthe three-body decay Q value, is the Q value for the \u03b1 + \u03b1 + p\ndecay of 9B (278 keV).\nIn Fig. 1(a) the Edecay spectrum for the two \u03b1 particles in\nthe M = 3 (\u03b1\u03b1p) channel is shown. A strong peak appears at\nthe expected energy for the decay of the 8Begs. This energy,\nQ2 = 92 keV, is indicated by the arrow. The 8Begs events\nseen in Fig. 1(a) and the proton in the M = 3(\u03b1\u03b1p) channel\nwere then used to reconstruct Edecay for the 8Begs + p decay\nof 9B [Fig. 1(b)]. Again the arrow indicates the expected\nground state position, Q3 = 278 keV. The cross sections for\nthe production of 8Begs and 9Bgs in the M = 3(\u03b1\u03b1p) channel\nare given in Table I. These were calculated by correcting the\nexperimental yields with detection efficiencies obtained from\nTABLE I. Cross sections for the decay channels (see text).\nMultiplicity Decay channel \u03c3 (mb)\nM = 3(\u03b1\u03b1p) 8Begs \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1 42.6 \u00b1 8.8\nM = 3(\u03b1\u03b1p) 9Bgs \u2192 8Begs + p 30.5 \u00b1 6.3\nM = 3(\u03b1pp) (5Li(0\u2212900keV) \u2192 \u03b1 + p) (17.4 \u00b1 3.6)\nM = 3(\u03b1pp) 6Begs \u2192 5Li(0\u2212900keV) + p 10.5 \u00b1 2.2\nM = 4(\u03b1\u03b1pp) 10C \u2192 9B +p 9.2 \u00b1 1.9\nM = 4(\u03b1\u03b1pp) 10C \u2192 6Be +\u03b1 3.3 \u00b1 0.7\na Monte Carlo simulation of the reaction and detector array.\nThe quoted uncertainties reflect both the statistical errors from\nthe three target data sets and a 20% uncertainty in the target\nthicknesses. The absolute cross sections are also expected to\nbe subject to a systematic uncertainty of the order of a factor\nof two. This arises as the angular distributions for each of the\nsequential decay processes are unknown. These have therefore\nbeen assumed to be isotropic in the center-of-mass frame of\nthe decays. The relative strength between the two channels\nis not very sensitive to the angular distributions used in the\nsimulation, however, and is therefore not subject to such a\nsystematic uncertainty. As may be seen in Table I, 72 \u00b1 21%\nof the 8Begs events seen in Fig. 1(a) arise from the decay of\nthe 9Bgs events observed in Fig. 1(b).\nIn Fig. 1(c) the Edecay spectrum for the decay of 5Li to\n\u03b1 + p(Q2 = 1967 keV) for M = 3(\u03b1pp) events is shown. A\nclear peak at the 5Li ground state energy is not seen, indicating\nlittle or no yield corresponding to direct \u03b1 + p removal.\nHowever, the Q value for the decay of 6Be to 5Li + p is\n\u2212595 keV, and hence the available Edecay(5Li) corresponding\nto 5Ligs decays is 1967 \u2212 595 = 1372 keV.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 021301(R) (2008)\nbarrier indicates the yield from the decay is shifted away\nfrom 1372 keV toward Edecay(5Li) = 0 keV, with 96% of\nthe 5Ligs events being in the Edecay(5Li) = 0 to 900 keV\nrange. These calculations reproduce the sharp rise in the\ndecay energy spectrum below 500 keV, the predicted decay\nstrength (arbitrarily scaled) being indicated by the dashed line\nin Fig. 1(c). Although the calculations do describe the data it\nis recognized that the width of the 5Ligs is not well known,\nand there are possible \u03b1 + p final state interactions. The\ncross section for this channel is therefore not unambiguously\ndetermined and hence is only given tentatively in Table I. A\ngate was applied across the 0 to 900 keV range (indicated by\nthe vertical dotted line in Fig. 1(c) to select the 5Ligs events\nresulting from the decay of 6Be. This gate maximized the 5Ligs\nyield and at the same time minimized the background from\nM = 3(\u03b1pp) events in which the Edecay(5Li) was calculated\nfrom the \u03b1 particle and the incorrect proton.\nIn Fig. 1(d) the Edecay spectrum for 6Be decay, obtained\nfrom the M = 3(\u03b1pp) events and gated on the 5Ligs, is shown.\nThe arrow indicates the expected ground state peak position\n(Q3 = 1372 keV). The observed peak indicates the analysis\nof the intermediate 5Li decay was successful in selecting the\ncorrect events. Without the 5Ligs gate the 6Be Edecay spectrum\ncontains increased background. The cross sections for 5Ligs\nand 6Begs production in the M = 3(\u03b1pp) channel are listed in\nTable I and are subject to the same factor of two systematic\nuncertainty as for the 8Begs and 9Bgs channels (see above). The\ncross sections indicate that 60 \u00b1 18% of events within the 0 to\n900 keV range of the 5Li Edecay arise from 6Begs decay.\nThe 10C Ex spectra, obtained from Ex = Edecay \u2212\nQ4(Q4 = \u22123.727 MeV) for the M = 4(\u03b1\u03b1pp) events, are\nshown in Fig. 2, along with the Monte Carlo predicted\ndetection efficiencies (dot-dashed lines).

The 10C Ex spectrum for\nevents involving decay via the 8Begs is shown in Fig. 2(a)\nand corresponds to the 10C \u2192 9B +p, 9B \u2192 8Be +p, 8Be\n\u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1 decay channel. Events not decaying via the 8Begs\nare shown in Fig. 2(b). To minimize the contribution from\ndecays to the 8Be excited state at 3.04 MeV, an additional\ngate, on the 6Begs, was applied to this data. The 6Be Edecay\nspectrum for the M = 4(\u03b1\u03b1pp) events is very similar in form\nto that for the M = 3(\u03b1pp) data shown in Fig. 1(d). The data\nin Fig. 2(b) therefore correspond to the 10C \u2192 6Be + \u03b1, 6Be\n\u2192 5Li +p, 5Li \u2192 \u03b1 + p decay channel. The peaks observed\nin the spectra have been reproduced using Gaussian line shapes\nabove a smooth (polynomial) background. The overall fits are\ngiven by the solid lines in Fig. 2, the background is given by\nthe dashed lines, and the individual peaks are given by the\ndotted lines. Two peaks are seen at energies of 4.20 \u00b1 0.01\nand 5.31 \u00b1 0.03 MeV and with widths of 280 \u00b1 10 and 450 \u00b1\n90 keV (FWHM), respectively, in Fig. 2(a). The peak at\n4.20 MeV has not been previously reported and appears to be\na new state in 10C (it does not arise from any threshold effect).\nThe second peak, at 5.31 MeV, corresponds to the known, and\nin this data, unresolved, states at 5.22 and 5.38 MeV [3]. In\nFig. 2(b) one peak is seen at 6.74 \u00b1 0.04 MeV with a width\nof 570 \u00b1 110 keV. This corresponds to the known state at\n6.58 MeV [3]. The observed widths are dominated by experi-\nmental resolution, which is proportional to (Ex \u2212 Ethreshold)1\/2.\nA resolution of 280 keV at 4.2 MeV would rise to 650 keV\nat 6.7 MeV following this relationship. The uncertainties\nquoted in the centroid energies are statistical only. A 200 keV\nuncertainty across the observed Ex range is typical in breakup\nwork of this kind. The cross sections for the 9B + p and\n6Be + \u03b1 breakup of 10C are given in Table I. These were\nobtained by determining the experimental yields over a range\nof excitation energies (starting at the decay threshold), 4.0\nto 7.0 MeV in the case of the 9B + p decay and 5.1 to\n12.0 MeV for the 6Be + \u03b1 channel. Cross sections for the\nindividual states observed in Fig. 2 are listed in Table II.\nThe structure of the 10C ground state is, in principle,\nprobed via the \u03b1 and p removal processes. Table I lists\nthe corresponding cross sections for the M = 3 and 4 final\nstates. The two multiplicities probe different types of reaction\nprocesses. The M = 4 yields reflect \u201cdiffractive\u201d breakup,\nwhereas the M = 3 also include absorptive processes, where\neither the proton or the \u03b1 particle is \u201cabsorbed\u201d by the target.\nCorrespondingly, the M = 3 cross sections are larger than the\nM = 4 counterparts. In both the M = 3 and 4 data the 9B + p\ncross section is \u223c3 times larger than that for the 6Be + \u03b1\nbreakup. It should be noted that the probability of the disin-\ntegration of an initial state \u03b1 particle is small due to the high\nTABLE II.

Angular distribution (\u03c8) for the (a) 4.20 and (b) 5.31\nMeV states in 10C. The various lines are described in the text.\nbreakup threshold of 4He (19.8 MeV). Thus the favoring of the\nproton removal correlates with the lower breakup threshold for\nthat channel (Q[10C \u2192 9B + p] = \u22124.005 MeV) compared\nwith \u03b1 removal (Q[10C \u2192 6Be + \u03b1] = \u22125.099 MeV). From\na clustering perspective, the lower p decay threshold would\npermit the 9B + p configuration to be more strongly developed\nin the ground state than the 6Be + \u03b1 partition.\nIn Fig. 3 angular distributions are shown for the 4.20 and\n5.31 MeV states observed in the 9B + p decay of 10C. Here \u03c8\ncorresponds to the angle between the relative velocity vector\nof the 9B and p decay fragments and the beam axis. The dotted\nlines indicate the predicted angular distributions obtained\nfrom a Monte Carlo simulation assuming isotropic decay. In\nFig. 3(a), the \u03c8 distribution for the 4.20 MeV state, there\nappears to be little structure, although there is some evidence\nthat the distribution has a minima at \u03c8 = 90\u25e6. This suggests\nthat the data should be described by an odd order Legendre\npolynomial. Monte Carlo efficiency corrected Legendre poly-\nnomials of order 1 (dashed line) and 3 (dot-dash line) are\nshown, but it is clear that neither provides a good description\nof the experimental yield. The angular distribution for the\n5.31 MeV state [Fig. 3(b)] exhibits a much clearer periodic\nstructure, and there is a very good agreement with the Monte\nCarlo corrected Legendre polynomial of order 2 (dashed line).\nThe spectrum of 10C excited states should closely mirror\nthat of 10Be (the latest work is summarized in Ref. [4]). In\nthe present region of interest there are four states that are\nalmost degenerate in 10Be: 5.958 MeV [2+], 5.960 MeV\n[1\u2212], 6.179 MeV [0+], and 6.263 MeV [2\u2212]. The negative\nparity states correspond to the excitation of a p3\/2 neutron to\nthe sd shell, and the 2+ state corresponds to the recoupling\nof the p-shell nucleons [5]. The equivalent states in 10C\nshould be strongly populated in the 10B(3He,t)10C reaction [6].\nThe 6.179 MeV [0+] state in 10Be corresponds to a (sd)2\nconfiguration. This state has recently been shown to possess a\nhighly deformed \u03b1 + 2n + \u03b1 structure [7]. The states observed\nin the 10B(3He,t)10C reaction, at 5.22, 5.38, and 6.58 MeV [6],\nwere also observed in the inelastic scattering studies recently\nreported in Ref. [8]. It is likely that these correspond to the\n1\u2212, 2\u2212, and 2+ states. The 4.20 MeV state was not observed\nin Ref. [8], however, although this may be due to a reduced\ndetection efficiency at low Ex when compared to the present\nwork. In the current data set the 4.20 MeV state was only\nseen after \u201cpileup\u201d events in the DSSD were recovered. Such\nevents occur in low Edecay breakup, where the small relative\nlaboratory angle between particles often leads to detection\nof two (or more) particles in the same front DSSD strip\nbut separate back DSSD strips (or vice versa). Because the\nindividual particle energies are known from the separate strips\nfrom the side of the DSSD where pileup did not occur, the\nevent may be reconstructed. Recovery of such events, where\nthe DSSD front and back multiplicities did not both equal\nM = 4, gave rise to very good detection efficiency at low\nvalues of Ex . The 4.20 MeV peak was not strongly populated\n(if at all) in the charge-exchange reaction [6], indicating that\nit is associated with a more complex configuration, perhaps\n(sd)2. The angular distributions (Fig. 3) for the 4.20 and\n5.31 MeV peaks were characteristically different, indicating\ndifferent spins. The subsequent proton decay of a 1\u2212(2\u2212) state\nwould proceed through l values of 0, 2 (0, 2, 4). A 0+ state\nwould decay via l = 1. Interestingly, the data for the 5.31 MeV\npeak suggests l = 2, indicating the peak is associated with the\n1\u2212 or 2\u2212 states. The angular distribution for the 4.20 MeV\npeak, however, indicates odd l, suggesting an association with\nthe 0+ state. The 6.74 MeV state in 10C could then be the\nanalog of the 5.958 MeV [2+] state in 10Be.\nIf the 4.20 MeV state is the analog of the 6.179 MeV 0+\nmolecular state in 10Be [7], it would be expected that the two\nstates should lie at approximately the same energy above the\nrespective cluster decay thresholds. In the case of 10Be, the 0+\nstate lies 0.6 MeV below the 9Be + n decay threshold, whereas\nthe 10C 4.20 MeV state lies 0.2 MeV above the 9B + p decay\nthreshold. This relatively small difference could arise from\nthe increased repulsion in the case of 9B + p. It is possible\nto calculate the Coulomb energy difference (CED) expected\nbetween such molecular states in 10Be and 10C. If the present\n4.20 MeV state is indeed associated with the 6.17 MeV 10Be\nstate, then the energy difference is close to 2 MeV. Such a\ndifference is rather large compared to other nuclei but could be\nenhanced for an extended distribution of the valence particles.\nThe CED of the 10Be and 10C ground states was computed\naccording to the formalism from Ref. [9],\nEc = [0.60Z2 \u2212 0.460Z4\/3 \u2212 0.15(1 \u2212 (\u22121)Z)]e2\/R, (1)\nwhere Ec is the Coulomb energy and R = 1.3A1\/3. The energy\ndifference of the excited states was calculated assuming a\n4He + 6He(6Be) cluster partition with a separation of 5.9 fm.\nThis separation is that deduced in Ref. [4] from an analysis\nof the rotational band based on the 0+2 state in 10Be. Such an\nanalysis gives an energy shift of 0.8 MeV (i.e., Ex(10C) =\n5.37 MeV). However, because the two protons are localized\nat one center, this has a higher energy than two 5Li clusters\nwith the same separation, with a radius given by R = 1.3A1\/3.\n021301-4\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nBREAKUP REACTION STUDY OF THE BRUNNIAN . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 021301(R) (2008)\nIn this instance, a reduction of 1.45 MeV in the energy of the\n0+ excited state is found, Ex(10C) = 4.72 MeV. Furthermore,\nif the valence protons are allowed to occupy extended\norbits outside the \u03b1-particle cores, then the Coulomb energy,\nand therefore the excitation energy, would be reduced. The\nCoulomb energy of two concentric spheres of differing radii\nwas calculated in Ref. [10]. With a molecular description of the\nexcited state, the valence particles are exchanged between the\n\u03b1-particle cores. In this instance, the valence protons\/neutrons\nwould have a radius approaching the separation of the \u03b1\nparticles. This would induce a Coulomb shift of 1.85 MeV\nand place the 0+ state close to 4.3 MeV\u2014consistent with\nthe present measurement. Of course, the present estimates\nignore the exchange properties and correlations that may\nexist in the system and assume spherical distributions. Cal-\nculations based on more microscopic approaches would be\ninteresting.\nIn summary, both the ground state structure and that of the\nexcited states have been explored in the present measurements.\nThe dissociation of the ground state of the Brunnian nucleus\n10C into the constituents 2\u03b1 + 2p has been measured. The\ncross sections indicate that the dominant configuration is 9B +\np, rather than 6Be + \u03b1. In the multiplicity 4 coincidences,\nthe 10C excitation energy spectra have been reconstructed. A\nnew state was observed at Ex = 4.20 MeV, which may be\nthe \u03b1 + 2p + \u03b1 analog of the 6.179 MeV [0+] \u03b1 + 2n + \u03b1\nmolecular state in 10Be. It should be noted that the ground\nand excited states should have different structures, based on\nthe understanding that has been developed for 10Be [4]. The\nground state is expected to be more compact. A calculation of\nthe energy difference between the ground and excited states in\n10Be and 10C shows that, to produce a 0+ state at 4.20 MeV, a\nlarge degree of clusterization is required and that the protons\nshould occupy delocalized orbits.\nThe assistance of the GANIL and LPC technical staff is\ngratefully acknowledged.
