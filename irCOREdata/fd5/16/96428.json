This paper considers the impact of these different approaches to \nscale and selectivity in research objects, focusing in particular on studies of Pirah\u00e3 and \nChinese numerical cognition.  Everyone accepts that cultural factors, such as the use of \ndifferent counting term sets in different languages, may influence numerical thought.  But \nthe tendency of psychologists to restrict scale and  eliminate variables, including cultural \nones, in order to be able to  falsify their claims, sits uncomfortably with the \nanthropological tendency to incorporate variables, in order to be holistic.   \n \nIt is sometimes said that anthropologists specialise in looking at human experience in \nvery fine, even \u2018microscopic\u2019, detail.  Perhaps this is true in some poetic sense or by \ncomparison with, say, macroeconomists.  Anthropologists do, of course, sometimes focus \non the tiny details of rituals, language use, everyday life, and so on.  But Alfred Gell once \nobserved that the average scale of anthropological analysis is the human lifecycle \u2013 \nwhich, if you think about it, is not exactly vanishingly small \n \nStafford-Evidence 9 2\nWhen I started reading the literature on numerical cognition a few years ago (as \nbackground for a project on numeracy and economic agency in China), it struck me that \nexperimental psychologists are the ones who really do fine-grained research.  For \ninstance, an article by Starkey et al entitled \u2018Numerical abstraction by human infants\u2019 \nrests largely on evidence about the reactions of 6- to 9-month old infants to displays of \neither two or three objects.  The key question is whether or not their staring time \u2013 \nsomething measured by two independent observers, and taken as an indication of their \nlevel of interest in what they are being shown \u2013 will increase when the number of objects \nis changed from two to three, and back again (Starkey et al 1990). Would it ever occur to \nan anthropologist to consider infant staring time in such meticulous detail?  Such things \nare surely well below our radar.  (Note that when psychologists look at a \u2018small\u2019 aspect of \nhuman behaviour, such as infant staring time, they typically do so repeatedly \u2013 i.e. they \nseek a very large sample of it.  Whereas anthropologists often work with very restricted \nsamples of (relatively) \u2018large\u2019 and multi-faceted human behaviours, such as \u2018the \nformation of Chinese identity\u2019.) 1 \n \nNeedless to say, if experimental psychology seems fine-grained and rigorous by \ncomparison with anthropology it is partly because it is experimental. Unlike social and \ncultural anthropologists, psychologists spend much of their time and energy devising \nexperimental protocols in order \u2013 eventually \u2013 to gather evidence related to tightly \ndefined hypotheses (e.g. about the ability of human infants, at specific stages of cognitive \ndevelopment, to take in and process numerical information). This lends a precise and \nexacting nature to their work.  But they are also prepared, more prosaically, to consider \nDeleted:  \u00b6\n\u00b6\nStafford-Evidence 9 3\nhuman life and thought in terms of manageable chunks.   Instead of asking questions such \nas \u2018How do Chinese children learn to be good sons and daughters?\u2019 or \u2018What is the \nimpact of globalisation on Chinese conceptions of childhood?\u2019, they might ask questions \nsuch as \u2018How do Chinese children learn to count to three?\u2019  This scaling down (which \ndoes not mean that the questions at stake are any less important) makes it possible for \nthem to be more precise about the evidence needed to sustain particular types of \npsychological claims; or perhaps one should say that the drive to sustain particular types \nof psychological claims is what leads, in the first place, to the scaling down. (My guess is \nthat the two things go together.) Of course some anthropologists, e.g. linguistic \nanthropologists, also deal with the relatively micro, whereas some psychologists, e.g. \neducational psychologists, deal with the relatively macro.  But as a general rule, \npsychologists seem quite happy \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 to eliminate variables and\/or \ncontrol them out of the analytical\/experimental frame in order to have a manageable topic \nof research.  Similarly, as Anthony Good notes (in this collection), legal practitioners \ntypically seek to \u2018prune away \u201cextraneous\u201d details\u2019 in an attempt to get at underlying \nprinciples.  By contrast, anthropologists seem preternaturally inclined \u2013 for better or \nworse \u2013 to try to take \u2018everything\u2019 into account.2    \nIn spite of these marked differences in outlook and approach towards evidence and scale \n(which, of course, are far from the only differences between anthropologists and \npsychologists, cf. Knight & Astuti, this collection) there have been a growing number of \ncalls in recent years for increased cooperation between the two disciplines (e.g. Cole \n1996, Shore 1996, Bloch 1998, Hirschfeld 2000, Astuti et al 2005).  In simple terms, it \nhas been suggested that psychologists can no longer ignore, or gently side-step, the \nDeleted: \u00b6\nStafford-Evidence 9 4\nhistorical and socio-cultural foundations of human knowledge, while anthropologists \nmust surely now accept (pace Durkheim) that many of their most cherished topics of \nresearch \u2013 emotion, memory, identity, and so on \u2013 are intrinsically psychological in \nnature.  Calls for cooperation are presumably a good thing, but will our basic orientations \ntowards research scale and selectivity stand in the way? Are practitioners of either \ndiscipline actually going to cede methodological (as opposed to conceptual) ground in \norder to achieve a rapprochement?  Will the kind of evidence routinely collected by \nanthropologists \u2013 our accounts of everything \u2013 ever really be of interest to psychologists, \nand vice versa?  \n \nHere I want to consider these questions with reference to work on human numeracy.  This \nis an area of individual cognitive development in which, after all, the significance of \ncultural and linguistic variables is beyond doubt (cf. Butterworth 1999, Dehaene 1999).  \nLacking expertise in the variety of human cultures and languages, psychologists of \nnumeracy might reasonably turn to anthropologists for help. But the psychology of \nnumeracy is also a field of study in which much of the most relevant data turns out to be \nvery micro indeed, at least when seen from an anthropological perspective .  In what \nfollows, I will first discuss a recent case in which a psychologist went to the Amazon in \nsearch of \u201cecologically valid\u201d experimental evidence, collaborating along the way with a \nhighly experienced field linguist \u2013 perhaps to his regret.  Then I will turn to my own \nresearch in China, and to the question of the relationship between micro-features of \nChinese language\/culture and the numerical skills of people there.  In both of these cases, \nI want to ask how much cultural evidence psychologists are prepared to take on board, \nStafford-Evidence 9 5\nand also to what extent anthropologists are prepared \u2013 or even able \u2013 to provide \npsychologists with the types of (stripped down) evidence they want or need.   My sense is \nthat practitioners in both disciplines are committed, for the most part without even \nthinking about it, to their customary scales of research.  In turn, this may make it difficult \n(good intentions notwithstanding) for them to engage seriously with evidence from the \nother side \u2013 which probably seems, respectively, either much too \u2018big\u2019 to be useful or \nmuch too \u2018small\u2019 to be interesting.   I will suggest, however, that even relatively minor \nconcessions in either direction can pay dividends.    \n \n*** \n \nIn a fascinating article in Science, the psychologist Peter Gordon has recently discussed \nexperiments he conducted amongst an Amazonian people, the Pirah\u00e3, who have an \nunusually limited vocabulary for numbers (Gordon 2004).  To be more precise, they have \nterms which can be used to mean \u2018one\u2019 and \u2018two\u2019, but even these are not used very \nconsistently by them.  Beyond \u2018two\u2019, there is simply an expression for \u2018many\u2019. From the \npoint of view of a psychologist of numeracy like Gordon, the crucial (and very exciting) \nlinguistic\/cultural variable in this case is relatively circumscribed and (helpfully) can be \nstated negatively: the lack of Pirah\u00e3 counting words above \u2018two\u2019. (Note that from the \npoint of view of most anthropologists, counting terms would likely seem a very micro \nfeature of a whole way of life, the linguistic equivalent of infant staring time.)  The key \nquestion that follows on from this relatively circumscribed variable also seems \nstraightforward.  In the absence of counting words, how well will these people perform \nStafford-Evidence 9 6\non non-verbal numerical tasks, such as matching up sets of objects?  In some respects, it \nisn\u2019t very difficult to find out \u2013 although Gordon did have to spend a significant amount \nof time in Amazonia in order to do so.  The results suggest, in brief, that the Pirah\u00e3 are \nreasonably good at dealing with tasks involving very small numbers \u2013 one, two, \nsometimes three \u2013 whereas beyond this they lose the ability to be precise.  However, if \nimprecision is allowed they can also deal fairly well with larger quantities by drawing, \nGordon claims, on the innate human ability to make \u2018analog magnitude representations\u2019 \nof a rather fuzzy kind.  Language, he concludes, is what you need in order to represent \nlarge numerical values exactly (2004: 498).   \n \nHowever, Gordon\u2019s data are already being used to support very different theories about \nthe role of language in the development of numeracy.  Gelman & Butterworth cite the \nPirah\u00e3 case along with material from another Amazonian people, the Munduruk\u00fa, to \nsupport their claim (contra Gordon) that \u2018numerical concepts have an ontogenetic origin \nand a neural basis that are independent of language\u2019 (Gelman & Butterworth 2005:6, \nemphasis added; cf. Pica et al 2004; Gelman & Gallistel 2004; Carey 2004).  They stress \nthat the peoples in question, in spite of having very restricted number vocabularies, are \nable to cope surprisingly well with large numerical approximations.     \n \nAt stake in this debate, of course, are fundamental questions about the role of language \nand culture in human thought, and about our ability to think, if you like, without words.  \nBut in spite of these grand themes it might be noted \u2013 and this is not intended as a trivial \nobservation \u2013 that the articles in question (specifically Gordon [2004] in Science, and \nStafford-Evidence 9 7\nGelman & Butterworth [2005] in Trends in cognitive science) are incredibly succinct by \ncomparison with articles social scientists might find in, say, Comparative studies in \nsociety and history.  For instance, both the crucial experimental evidence (e.g. \u2018The \namazing result was that both groups succeeded on non-verbal number tasks that used \ndisplays representing values \u2026 as large as 80\u2019) and the crucial descriptive evidence (e.g. \n\u2018The Pirah\u00e3 do not even use the words for 1 and 2 consistently\u2019) are cited by Gellman & \nButterworth in a bracingly stripped down fashion that would rarely be encountered in \nreading anthropology (2005: 8-9).  Of course, this is partly a matter of writing and \npublishing conventions \u2013 after all, how much can one say about language or culture in an \narticle restricted to four or five pages, in which details of experimental protocols and \nresults are meant to be the principal focus?  But it is also surely a matter of intellectual \npriorities.  At least on the surface, it seems that, for experimental psychologists, one does \nnot need to know and\/or say very much about Pirah\u00e3 life \u2013 even about the bits of their life \nthat relate directly to numeracy and numerical practices \u2013 in order to debate their \nnumerical cognition. More specifically, although everyone (including Gordon, Gelman \nand Butterworth) appears to be in no doubt that culture and language may sometimes \nmatter a great deal, cultural and linguistic evidence typically enters these scientific \ndebates in highly circumscribed form.    \n \nOf course, the existence of complex \u2013 perhaps hard to circumscribe\u2013 cultural variables \ndoes loom at the margins of the discussion.  Gelman & Butterworth suggest, for example, \nthat the lack of number words among the Pirah\u00e3 and the Munduruk\u00fa might have \u2018a \nStafford-Evidence 9 8\ncultural basis\u2019. In the course of their (succinct) consideration of this, they draw attention \nto the fact that: \n \nMunduruk\u00fa culture differs from Western culture in innumerable ways, and \nit certainly uses numbers far less often than we do.  It remains possible that \none or more of these many differences were responsible for the differences \nin performance [on numerical tasks], and not just the lack of a counting \nvocabulary. (2005:9) \n \nGordon, for his part, provides brief descriptions of everyday numeracy practices among \nthe Pirah\u00e3  (such as their rather incompetent use of fingers as an enumeration aid), and \nhis experiments were certainly intended to have ecological validity \u2013 that is, to take \nserious account of Pirah\u00e3 culture and the flow of ordinary life amongst  the people with \nwhom he lived for some weeks.  \n \nBut again: how much scope is there, within psychology, to genuinely incorporate \nevidence about the \u2018innumerable differences\u2019 between cultures, or indeed non-\nexperimental evidence of any kind?3  In an online discussion which followed the \npublication of his Science article, Gordon complains about the difficulty of doing \nprecisely this. He says that his original manuscript contained some potentially very \nimportant information about Pirah\u00e3 numeracy, more specifically about their \nability\/inability to learn numbers in a different (i.e. non- Pirah\u00e3) language when presented \nwith the opportunity.  In brief, another scholar reported to him that a few years ago an \nStafford-Evidence 9 9\nattempt had been made to teach Portuguese numbers to Pirah\u00e3 villagers. It seems that \n\u2018The adults had a horrible time with it, the children had no problems (but were later told \nnot to continue [learning\/using the numbers] by adults)\u2019. Gordon points out that he had \noriginally included this information in a footnote to his paper, but was \u2018rebuked by a \nreviewer who said that such anecdotal evidence does not belong in the pages of \nScience\u2019.4    (Note that what is rejected here is not \u2018macro\u2019 evidence, as such, but rather \nnon-experimental evidence. However, as suggested above, the need to design plausible \nexperiments may itself lead to a scaling down towards \u2018micro\u2019 features of human \nbehaviour \u2013 the two things go together.)   \n \nEqually interesting is Gordon\u2019s tetchy response (in the same online discussion) to the \nsuggestion that neighbouring tribes should have served as control groups for his \nexperiments among the Pirah\u00e3.  Here the costs of ecological validity come crashing in as \na justification:  \n \nI think we all need a lesson here in doing research in the jungle.  You don\u2019t just \nwalk into a tribe and start doing experiments\u2026  If you want to contact a tribe as \nisolated as the Pirah\u00e3, you run a very high risk of being killed\u2026  [T]o study like \nthis isn\u2019t just a matter of holing up in a hotel and driving down to the village, but \nrequires staying for weeks at a time in the tribe, sleeping outside with jaguars \nroaming around at night, tarantulas dropping onto your hammock, poisonous \nsnakes\u2026  The shameful secret of doing actual field research \u2013 as opposed to some \nidealized design that you concoct at your computer in your air-conditioned office \nStafford-Evidence 9 10\nat MIT \u2013 is that you take advantage of what is available and you try not to get \nyourself killed in the process.5 \n \nThis appeal to the difficulty of \u2018being there\u2019, however overwrought, will have a familiar \nring to most anthropologists.  \n \nHowever, given Gordon\u2019s reliance, in the end, on standard research protocols, does this \nbackground noise about cultural particularities, the perils of real life, etc. really make any \ndifference? He certainly stresses that his conclusions are informed not only by the \nexperiments but also by his direct experience of the Pirah\u00e3 way of life. Significantly, they \nare further informed by the \u2018background of continuous and extensive immersion in the \nPirah\u00e3 culture\u2019 of the two scholars who made the project possible in the first place: \nDaniel and Keren Everett (Gordon 2004: 496).  After all, Daniel Everett, a linguistic \nanthropologist, has been living and working with the tribe for over 20 years.  Who better \nto give the imprimatur of holistic cultural understanding to Gordon\u2019s tightly focused \nexperimental work?    \n \nBut while Gordon must have anticipated criticisms from fellow psychologists, recent \ncomments from Everett \u2013 the man who introduced him to the Pirah\u00e3 \u2013 will perhaps have \nbeen more surprising.6   Everett says that Gordon\u2019s very general conclusions about Pirah\u00e3 \nnumeracy are \u2018likely correct\u2019 but he also says, rather confusingly, that he disagrees with \nthem \u2013 pointing out that Gordon\u2019s experimental design was culturally insensitive, making \nthe Pirah\u00e3 do precisely the kinds of things they hate to do. 7  Of course, Everett might \nStafford-Evidence 9 11\nhave helped the psychologist (his friend and former colleague) avoid this pitfall but he \nsays that \u2018during the time that he was working on the experiments, I had my own \npriorities and offered little help\u2019. He adds: \u2018Following the experiments, Gordon worked \nalone in interpreting the results, hampered by his lack of knowledge of the Pirah\u00e3 \nlanguage or culture, as well as by the fact that neither [Keren Everett] nor I were \navailable to help him by discussing with him the plausibility of his results, or even the \nrelevance of his experimental design to test numerosity in Pirah\u00e3\u2019. So much for \ncollaboration!   \n \nPerhaps psychologists who disagree with Gordon\u2019s linguistic determinism (i.e. with his \nview that language is a prerequisite of precise numeration) will take pleasure in Everett\u2019s \ncomments.  But I wonder what they will make of Everett\u2019s own recent, and strongly \ncultural determinist, discussion of the Pirah\u00e3 in Current Anthropology?   He claims not \nonly that they lack number terms but also that, among other things, they lack colour \nterms, that they have \u2018the simplest pronoun inventory known\u2019, that they lack creation \nmyths and fiction, that they have \u2018the simplest kinship system yet documented\u2019, that they \nhave no \u2018individual or collective memory of more than two generations past\u2019, that they do \nnot draw or produce art of any kind, and that they have \u2018one of the simplest material \ncultures documented\u2019 (Everett 2005: 621-34).  These extremely surprising features of \nPirah\u00e3 life, Everett suggests, are all the product of one thing: a culture that makes Pirah\u00e3 \ntalk only about \u2018nonabstract subjects which fall within the immediate experience of \ninterlocutors\u2019 (2005: 620). It is this \u2013 according to Everett \u2013 that constrains the \nStafford-Evidence 9 12\ndevelopment or adoption by them of linguistic or cultural features (such as telling stories \nabout the past or using relative tenses) that are found in most human societies.   \n \nNow, even if Everett\u2019s claims about the facts of Pirah\u00e3 life are true, his arguments about \nthe relationship between their culture, language, and thought are certainly open to \nquestion (see the comments section at Everett 2005: 635-644).  For one thing, a key plank \nof his argument is the fact that, in spite of over 200 years of contact with outsiders, the \nPirah\u00e3 have strenuously rejected the outside world.  He says they ask questions about the \noutside \u2018largely for the entertainment value of the answers\u2019 (2005: 626).  And yet he \nobserves that they routinely trade with non-Pirah\u00e3, that they are very keen on buying \nwhisky in particular, that Pirah\u00e3 women have sexual relations with Brazilians (and \nsometimes have children by them), and that they specifically asked Everett and his wife \nto teach them how to count and how to read so that they could become better traders.  At \nthe very least, this suggests a degree of ambivalence towards the outside world rather \nthan a total rejection of it \u2013 but to say so would weaken Everett\u2019s argument for the \ncultural determination of language.   \n \nIn any case, I mention all of this because Everett has relied, along the way, on some \nclassic anthropological arguments.  Notably, he is a linguistic anthropologist and, as his \nCurrent Anthropology article shows, he is not averse to the micro scale of research \ntypically found in psychology.  But like a true anthropologist, he also says that language \n(including the language of number) must be studied in the context of its use; that one \nshould be extremely cautious about \u2018testing\u2019 people through procedures which are alien \nStafford-Evidence 9 13\nto their way of life; and, perhaps most importantly, that human societies and human \nthought are highly synthetic \u2013 everything is embedded in, and connected to, everything \nelse.   He, like Gordon, is intrigued by the \u2018small\u2019 fact of the absence of counting words \namong the Pirah\u00e3.  But if you really want to understand Pirah\u00e3 numeracy, Everett seems \nto be saying to Gordon, you need to visit them over the course of 20 years and collect \nevidence about kinship, whisky-buying, trading, sexual relations, etc., i.e. you need to \ncollect evidence about \u2018everything\u2019. (Indeed, as Good notes in this collection, \nanthropologists often define both expertise and reliability of data precisely in relation to \nthe investigator\u2019s \u201cextent of experience\u201d.)Whereas Gordon, of course, simply wanted to \nknow if the Pirah\u00e3, lacking number words, could or could not do some simple non-verbal \nnumerical tasks such as matching two objects to two objects.  This is an empirical \nquestion, and Gordon (to his everlasting credit) went to a great deal of trouble to generate \nwhat is, in fact, a rather minimal and tightly focused data set in order to try to answer it.  \nIt is presumably this evidence which will be taken up and debated by other psychologists \n\u2013 not the fine details of Pirah\u00e3 social life, and certainly not Everett\u2019s radical holism.   \n \nWhat does this case tell us? Gordon\u2019s search for experimental evidence is driven by \nexisting debates in the psychology of numeracy which relate to language and culture but \nwhich are nevertheless mostly framed at a level below the anthropological radar.  He \ntravels to Amazonia and appears to have gone somewhat anthropological, in the sense \nthat he ends up having to explain to his fellow psychologists how complicated things are \nout there \u2013 that is, the Pirah\u00e3 way of life is complicated and doing \u2018real world\u2019 research is \ncomplicated too.  In the end, however, his primary task is to show how Pirah\u00e3 language \nStafford-Evidence 9 14\ndoes or does not influence numerical skills. Taking Gordon\u2019s conclusions about language \nand thought as a starting point (some might saw straw man), Everett goes on to suggest \nthat Pirah\u00e3 culture shapes not only numerical skills, but also grammar, collective \nmemory, kinship, art, material culture and so on.  His comprehensive knowledge of \nPirah\u00e3 language and life, the fruit of over twenty years\u2019 work, is presumably almost \nentirely wasted on his psychological colleagues, including (or so it seems) Gordon, for \nwhom it must surely comprise too much information.   \n \n*** \n \nNow let me shift focus to a very different place and a very different context for studies of \nnumerical cognition: China.  Not only does the Chinese language \u2013 unlike the Pirah\u00e3 \nlanguage \u2013 have a full complement of counting words, the numeration system has the \nfurther advantage (shared by other East Asian languages) of being consistent with base-\nten logic.  This happens to make it much easier to master than, say, the English one.  In \nEnglish, a child learning to count to twenty starts by learning ten new words (\u2018one\u2019, \n\u2018two\u2019, \u2018three\u2019, etc).  Then she learns some additional new words \u2013 \u2018eleven\u2019 and \u2018twelve\u2019 \u2013 \nwhich don\u2019t, on their own, tell her that she has shifted into a second set of tens, or indeed \nthat there is anything special about \u2018ten\u2019. It\u2019s a confusing business.  The Chinese system, \nby comparison, is a model of clarity, with everything based on combinations of the \noriginal ten words.  Eleven is simply a combination of \u2018ten\u2019 (shi) and \u2018one\u2019 (yi): \u2018ten-one\u2019 \n(shi-yi).  Twelve is \u2018ten-two\u2019, thirteen is \u2018ten-three\u2019, etc.  This (when taken in \ncombination with other features of the system) makes it easier for very young children to \nDeleted:  \nStafford-Evidence 9 15\ngrasp that eleven is ten plus one and that twelve is ten plus two \u2013 and, more importantly, \nthat there is something special about \u2018ten.\u2019 \n \nNow, this difference in counting words may seem a rather minor linguistic phenomenon \nsince children using either the Chinese or English system can perfectly well learn how to \ncount.  (And, like infant staring time, it is the kind of thing most anthropologists would \nscarcely notice.)  Reviewing the evidence, however, Geary suggests that children who \nlearn to count in Chinese (and associated East Asian languages) have some significant \nadvantages over those who do not.  They appear to \u2018\u2026make fewer counting errors; \nunderstand counting and number concepts at an earlier age; make fewer problem-solving \nerrors in arithmetic; and understand basic arithmetical concepts, such as place value and \ntrading, at a much younger age than their American and European peers\u2019 (Geary \n1994:244; cf. Geary et al 1996; for converging evidence from Korea and Japan see Fuson \n& Kwon 1992; Miura 1987; Miura et al 1988; Miura et al 1993).   \n \nOf course, by the time this happy outcome is achieved, a number of variables other than \nlanguage \u2013 such as schooling and parental pressure \u2013 may have intervened, and these too \nare discussed in the literature.  For this reason, it is instructive to compare the Chinese \ncase with the Pirah\u00e3 one outlined above.  For the Pirah\u00e3, the relatively simple claim (as \nformulated by Gordon within the framework of developmental cognitive science) is that \nthey don\u2019t have many number words, and this limits their ability to carry out numerical \ntasks beyond very small numbers.  This is shown experimentally.  In the Chinese case, \nthe relatively complex claim (as formulated by Geary within the framework of \nStafford-Evidence 9 16\ndevelopmental cognitive science and educational psychology) is that the system of \nnumber words contributes in positive ways to the development of children\u2019s \nnumerical\/arithmetical skills. The support for this claim has to be built up from separate \nbits of evidence (e.g. about children\u2019s counting error rates, or about their grasp of basic \nconcepts at different ages, by comparison with non-Chinese children).  Even then, \nbecause of the conflation of many factors in China which might produce the observed \noutcomes (ranging from schooling, to abacus training, to parental pressure) the \neducational psychology claim is undoubtedly harder to sustain \u2013 and perhaps in some \nways more anthropological? \u2013 than the Amazonian one.  It is a synthetic claim, based on \nthe aggregation of different studies, and probably more open to refutation.  \n \nIn any case, because Chinese counting terms (forgetting about schools, abacuses, parents, \netc.) provide a powerful illustration of how linguistic\/cultural variables shape numerical \nskills, they have been repeatedly cited and discussed in the psychological literature (e.g. \nin Fuson & Kwon 1992; Miller et al 1995; Dehaene 1999:91-106; Butterworth 1999:129-\n133).  Here is proof that culture really does have an impact on numerical cognition.  And \nI suspect that many psychologists, in their eagerness to use cultural illustrations of this \nkind, find it hard to resist a form of cultural butterfly collecting \u2013 which is not without its \ndangers.   \n \nIn neuropsychology, for example, each \u2018cultural case\u2019 becomes \u2013 or so it seems to me \u2013 \nthe equivalent of cases of patients with brain function impairments of various kinds, and \nin this sense the more exotic the better.  This is for the good reason that highly unusual \nStafford-Evidence 9 17\nconstraints (such as severe brain impairments following accidents, or highly atypical \ncounting systems) may reveal a great deal about human thinking.  (There\u2019s an irony here, \ngiven that many anthropologists are attracted to cognitive science precisely because it \nappears to offer an escape from the endless exoticism and circularity of cultural \nrelativism.)  In the index of The number sense, written by the neuropsychologist Stephan \nDehaene, there are entries for Aborigines, Arabs, Aztecs, Chinese, Dutch, Egyptians, \nFrench, Germans, Greeks, etc.  The index to Brian Butterworth\u2019s The mathematical brain \n(he is also a neuropsychologist) refers to Africans, Amazonians, Arabs, Babylonians, \nBasques, Chinese, Danish, and so on.  Both of these books are fascinating and deeply \nimpressive introductions to the psychology of numeracy.  But one potential problem with \nthe accumulation of examples (whether it is being done, as in these cases, for the \npurposes of illustration in books aimed at popular audiences, or in scholarly research \npapers) is that only an iconic detail or two about each culture is typically up for \ndiscussion (e.g. \u2018the Pirah\u00e3 do not have counting words above two\u2019), often by people who \ndo not have direct experience of the language\/culture in question. And as these iconic \ndetails \u2013 which are normally iconic for the good reason that somebody is able to make \nevidence-based claims about them \u2013 become the source material for a range of debates, \ntheir selective nature may be problematic.   \n \nFor example, in the literature on numerical cognition only two variables related to the \nChinese language (as opposed to the Chinese education system, etc.) appear to have \ncome up for serious discussion.  The first, as I\u2019ve just noted, is the system of counting \nwords.  The second is the speed at which these words can be pronounced.  With respect \nStafford-Evidence 9 18\nto the latter, the basic argument is that because you can (apparently) say strings of \nChinese numbers faster than, for example, strings of French numbers, Chinese speakers \nfind it easier than French speakers to recall long number sequences.  This, in turn, has an \nimpact on their ability to do mental calculation (cf. Dehaene 1999:102-3; Geary et al \n1993; Chen & Stevenson 1988; Stigler et al 1986).  As a research object for \npsychologists, this speed-of-pronunciation variable has the advantage of being micro and \nquantifiable (like infant staring time), thus making comparisons across languages \npossible.  \n \nBut if you consider Chinese number skills with respect to the whole human life-cycle \u2013 to \ngo back to that gigantic scale of anthropological analysis \u2013 both the number words set \nand the speed at which they are spoken look like being tiny blips on the radar.  It is hard \nfor me, as an anthropologist, to see how data about these two micro-variables can be \ngenuinely integrated with the kind of ethnographic evidence I have collected about the \nflow of everyday life in Chinese villages, or vice versa.  Obviously, children there embed \nnumber words in (sometimes long and rambling and incoherent) sentences, and even by \nthe time they are twelve or thirteen years old, their \u2018numerical cognition\u2019 is rooted in \ncomplex social practices such as learning physics at school or haggling with old ladies \nwhen buying vegetables at the local market.  Like Everett, I find myself suffering from \nholism, i.e. from an overload of causal variables and a mountain of highly diffuse \nethnographic evidence collected month after month in the Chinese countryside.    \n \nStafford-Evidence 9 19\nBut let me return briefly to the question of the memory for numbers \u2013 which, as I\u2019ve just \nsaid, the speed-of-pronunciation variable is meant to influence.  As it happens, I can think \nof plenty of other things which might influence the ability of Chinese people to recall \nnumbers, to hold them in mind.  I\u2019ll restrict myself here, by way of illustration, to one \n\u2018small\u2019 candidate influence and one \u2018big\u2019 one.   \n \nThe \u2018small\u2019 candidate influence is the tonality of the language. Along with other tonal \nlanguages, Chinese is effectively sung rather than spoken, and number sequences \ntherefore always take on a (potentially memorable) melody.  Assuming this does \ninfluence memory for numbers, my hunch is that for native speakers this would rarely be \nan explicit (conscious) phenomenon \u2013 but that it would still influence performance.  It\u2019s \ninteresting, by the way, to think what directions the general discussions of numerical \ncognition might have taken if tonality, a completely different type of variable, had been \nsomewhere on the agenda.  For one thing, tonality provides a kind of musical structure to \nlanguage, and numeracy itself is, of course, closely connected to the apprehension of \nstructure and pattern in experience (cf. Gallistel & Gelman 2005).   \n \nThe \u2018big\u2019 candidate influence on number recall (by which I really mean that it is an \naggregate of different variables) is the almost generic importance of numbers in China.  \n(While this may not, at first glance, seem like a linguistic variable, I believe that it can be \nso construed.)  In short, the relevance of numerical information \u2013 and here I\u2019m using \n\u2018relevance\u2019 in the sense intended by Sperber and Wilson (1995) \u2013 is redundantly \ncommunicated in China both through the direct use of language and through a wide range \nStafford-Evidence 9 20\nof communicative social practices (Stafford 2003).  To give an obvious illustration: \nChinese religion and cosmology are very numerical\/mathematical in orientation. It is \ntherefore widely assumed that numbers (and the manipulation of numbers) may reveal \nsignificant things about the fate of individuals in the flow of time.  Following on from \nthis, popular religious practice is often explicitly focused on numerical issues of various \nkinds (how many offerings to give, how many times to bow, how to read numerical \ndivination signs, etc).  The importance of numbers is further heightened, in contemporary \nChina and Taiwan, by their connection to the worlds of money and business \u2013 which, in \nthe popular view, are also thought of as highly \u2018fateful\u2019 and therefore not unrelated to \ncosmology and religion.  I could go on with a long list of illustrations, but the basic point \nis simple: numbers are crucially important and are explicitly seen to be so by ordinary \npeople. This message of relevance is redundantly communicated to them by Chinese \nculture.   \n \nNow, the educational psychology literature does, in fact, make reference to this \nkind of thing.  Geary and others have discussed, for instance, the high value attached to \nmathematics education in East Asia, and the possible impact of this on the educational \nachievement of children (Geary 1996; cf. Hatano 1990).  But with reference to Japan, \nMiura says that although social factors such as parental expectations about mathematics \nachievement \u2018undoubtedly affect overall performance [in school], it is unlikely that they \nspecifically influence the way in which a child mentally represents number\u2019 (Miura \n1987).  It isn\u2019t clear to me why this should be so, and my interest is precisely in the \npossibility that a generalised cultural valuation of number could itself have cognitive \nStafford-Evidence 9 21\neffects, by redundantly stressing the relevance of numerical information in cognitive \nenvironments. \n \nThese observations are likely, however, to raise a string of questions from sceptical \npsychologists \u2013 and sceptical anthropologists.  What exactly do I mean by saying that in \nChina numbers have an \u2018almost generic importance\u2019?  When does the influence of this \nvariable kick in?  During childhood?  How does it interact with other variables (such as \ncounting terms or schooling)? Given that the importance of numbers could be expected to \nvary over historical time in China, and even between different individuals at the same \ntime, what are the risks of treating it as an aggregate, ahistorical variable?  And if I want \nto disaggregate this variable, in order to make it more testable, where should I start?  \nWith the importance of numbers in religion, in business, or somewhere else?  Finally, \nhow could I prove that this cultural variable actually motivates attention to numbers? \n \nWhen it comes to collaboration, my guess is that psychologists would appreciate it if \nanthropologists would come up with ideas like my \u2018small\u2019 candidate influence \u2013 tonality.  \nAgain, this is partly an issue of scale.  It is a relatively restricted point, and one can \nimagine that it could be tested in some straightforward ways.  And yet from an \nanthropological point of view it is an incredibly small bit of information about Chinese \nlanguage\/culture.  How much could I say about it based on my long-term fieldwork in \nChinese and Taiwanese villages?  Almost nothing.  By contrast, I could say a lot about \nmy \u2018big\u2019 candidate influence (the generic importance of numbers in Chinese society and \nculture); this is the kind of topic that could easily fill an anthropological monograph.  \nStafford-Evidence 9 22\nHowever, I suspect that for most experimental psychologists such a monograph would \nsimply provide interesting background noise, awaiting clarification through a process of \ndisembedding, scaling down and experimentation.  It would be like learning that the \nPirah\u00e3 have been trading with the Brazilians for a long time \u2026 \n \n*** \n \nMy point in considering these two cases - the Pirah\u00e3 one and the Chinese one \u2013 isn\u2019t to \nhighlight the fatal incompatibility of anthropological holism (taking everything into \naccount) and psychological particularism (looking for repeated examples of one small \nthing).  Nor do I want to suggest that psychologists, in spite of their interest in \ncultural\/linguistic variables, are never going to be able to cope with the complexities of \nculture in the real world.   Instead, I\u2019d like to conclude this discussion by noting two \nrather common sins, as I see it, on the anthropological side \u2013 sins which relate very \ndirectly to the overarching topics of evidence and scale addressed in this collection.  The \nfirst is the use of anthropological holism as an excuse for avoiding detail, and therefore \navoiding saying anything falsifiable.  By holding that all things are interconnected, we \ntend to make falsification of our claims (e.g. via experimentation) more or less \nimpossible.  The second is the romanticisation of anthropological research, and more \nspecifically the idea that it has an ecological validity unmatched by other disciplines \u2013 \nthis in spite of the fact that fieldwork is, of course, a dramatic intervention in the lives of \nour informants.  Would it really be such an unnatural imposition for anthropologists to \nexamine the micro, as psychologists do, using experimental techniques?      \nStafford-Evidence 9 23\n \nBearing this in mind, and inspired by my reading in (micro) cognitive psychology, during \na recent period of fieldwork in rural Taiwan I carried out a pilot project in which I tried \nprecisely to see whether or not I could quantify the \u2018big\u2019 variable I mentioned above \u2013 i.e. \nthe \u2018generic importance attributed to numbers\u2019. Very briefly: I showed subjects a drawing \nof a street scene in which certain types of information was embedded: colour (e.g. the \ncolour of a girl\u2019s dress), written language (e.g. words on a street sign), explicit number \n(by which I mean numbers written out, e.g. numbers on a license plate), and implicit \nnumber (by which I mean objects that could be counted, e.g. birds in the sky).  Subjects \nwere given 15 seconds to look at the drawing, after which it was taken away and they \nwere asked a series of questions about the content \u2013 such as \u2018What colour is the dog?\u2019, \n\u2018What is the number on the house?\u2019, \u2018How many trees are there?\u2019, etc.   A sample of \nrespondents from the UK, approximately matched in terms of age and educational level, \nprovided a control group for the research.   \n \nMy hypothesis was that the Taiwanese subjects \u2013 having been enculturated into the \nChinese way of thinking of numerical information as having an intrinsic relevance, \nregardless of context \u2013 would be more likely than UK subjects to notice and recall \ncorrectly the numbers embedded in the drawing.  In fact, the results (based on this very \nlimited pilot project) showed no such thing: the UK subjects were marginally more likely \nto get the numbers right.  Of course, this outcome might be explained in many ways, \nincluding the possibility that my research design was completely wrong, or \u2013 just as \nlikely \u2013 that my hypothesis was an implausible one to start with.    \nStafford-Evidence 9 24\n \nAnd yet, the simple fact of attempting to prove, through quantification, a general claim I \nwas making about Chinese numeracy was extremely productive for me in a range of \nways.  One rather simple point is that the drawings proved to be a good prompt for \ngeneral discussions.  The task facing my friends in the village was a completely \nunexpected one, and it provoked them into saying interesting, sometimes very telling, \nthings about numbers and numerical skills.  As well as prompting interesting discussions, \nthe experiment (well, the quasi-experiment) forced me to think \u2013 in ways which \nanthropologists are often not forced to think \u2013 about exactly what I was trying to say or \nclaim about numbers in China.  For instance, the task called on subjects to remember \nnumbers, and from this I would infer whether or not they think that numerical \ninformation is, by default, important.  But this raises the complex question of whether \nremembering something is the same thing as attributing relevance to it. Also, although \nmy hypothesis was that numbers would be shown to have \u2018intrinsic relevance\u2019, a more \nlikely scenario (as I suspected from the outset) is that numerical relevance is highly \ncontext-specific.  This raises the question of which contextual effects would elicit more \nattention to numbers, and whether or not these effects, which are very hard to reproduce \nartificially, could be tested in an ecologically valid way.    \n \n \nIn short, simply using the pilot project as a heuristic device had the effect of improving \nmy thinking, as an anthropologist, about Chinese numerical culture and how it is learned \nand used.  This involved scaling down \u2013 giving up a little bit on anthropological holism, \nStafford-Evidence 9 25\nand trying to be more precise about how my claims and observations could, or could not, \nbe supported.   \n \nI have mentioned, in the course of this discussion, variables of the \u2018micro\u2019 kind around \nwhich psychologists sometimes focus their own research on numeracy: infant staring \ntime, small sets of counting terms, the speed at which number words are pronounced.  \nAlthough anthropologists claim to revel in the small details of everyday life \u2013 and so they \noften do \u2013 the fact is that many experimental psychologists look at human life in finer \ndetail than us.  They do this not because they are miniaturists, but because they seek to \nmake and support falsifiable claims about human thought and behaviour.  The same \nstandard of falsifiability does not apply in anthropology, and this arguably tends to push \nanthropologists in the opposite direction in terms of research scale.  To be an expert in \npsychology (at least of the kind I have been discussing in this paper) is to convincingly \nuse evidence drawn from the tiny details of life in order to support claims related to very \nbig themes (such as the relation of language to thought).  To be an expert in social and \ncultural anthropology is, for the most part, to possess a kind of encyclopaedic store of \nevidence \u2013 historical, ethnographic, anecdotal \u2013 about a particular group of people.  The \nrisk for psychologists is that, caught up in the activity of eliminating variables and \nrestricting scale, they might not see the forest for the trees. (For example, they might get \nobsessed with counting terms and then not see the full variety of ways in which Chinese \nlanguage and language use influence numerical cognition.)  The risk for anthropologists, \ncaught up in the activity of accumulating variables and expanding scale, is that they \nStafford-Evidence 9 26\nmight not understand any of the trees very well, and simply wander around the forest \nmaking claims that can never be falsified.   \nStafford-Evidence 9 27\nReferences \nAstuti, R., S.
