Introduction 44 \nThermal treatment has been recognized as a valuable technique for the recovery of the 45 \nenergy content of wastes within the waste management hierarchy. Recent data (Defra, 46 \n2009) indicate that countries like Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, 47 \nLuxemburg, Germany, France and Portugal, incinerate more than 20% of their 48 \ngenerated municipal solid waste. In addition, or in replacement, of traditional mass 49 \ngrate thermal treatment, the use of the combustible output fractions of MBT plants 50 \ncould further support a sustainable short\/middle- term approach for the management 51 \nof the increasing volumes of wastes, especially in dense metropolitan areas (Caputo 52 \nand Pelagagge, 2002). This integrated waste treatment approach has increased its 53 \npresence in Europe, with MBT plants that reach a capacity of 2 million tons per 54 \nannum (Velis et al., 2009).  55 \nDespite these facts, public opinion is sometimes against developments regarding 56 \nintegrated thermal treatment applications, even in developed counties (Luria, 2008). 57 \nThese oppositions mainly focus on direct health effects from emissions and residues 58 \nof these technologies based on past experience. Issues related to chlorine and heavy 59 \nmetals content of waste derived fuels have resulted to limited demand of the latter 60 \nduring the past decade (Rotter et al., 2004).  61 \nIn this context, the standardization of SRF (CEN\/TS 15359, 2006) in terms of 62 \ncalorific value, trace metals and chlorine content, intends to facilitate the economic, 63 \nemissions, and technological issues associated with the acceptance and marketability 64 \nof waste derived fuels and related applications. According to the abovementioned 65 \nstandard, SRF is distinguished from the classical term of refuse derived fuel (RDF), as 66 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nthe initial characterization criterion is a non-hazardous waste source and the final 67 \ncriterion is a quality assured (QA) classification according to the following properties: 68 \n\uf0b7 The mean net calorific value 69 \n\uf0b7 The mean value of chlorine content 70 \n\uf0b7 The mean and 80th percentile values for mercury content. Both values are 71 \ntaken into account and due to the statistical distribution pattern of Hg. The 72 \nhighest value is used for determination of the SRF class.  73 \nEach property is divided in five classes with range values and the combination of the 74 \nproperty classes makes up the class code for each SRF. 75 \nSRF standardization protocols can support the development and expansion of waste- 76 \nfuel markets (Bernd et al., 2007). This expansion is expected to increase the quantities 77 \nof the generated combustion and air pollution control (APC) residues. In the UK this 78 \namount is expected to reach 162,000 tons per annum in 2010, from about 83,000 tons 79 \nin 2000 (Amutha Rani et al., 2008). Fly ash in particular, is an issue of concern as it is 80 \nenriched with heavy metals, soluble salts and organic micro-pollutants (Huang et al., 81 \n2003; He et al., 2004; Hyks et al., 2009), that could be released in the environment 82 \nfrom its utilization or landfilling. Thus, knowledge of the characteristics of these 83 \nresidues is of extreme importance for their treatment within good integrated waste 84 \nmanagement practices.  85 \nThis work characterizes the fly ashes produced from the combustion of East London\u2019s 86 \nSRF in a fluidized bed reactor. The following toxicity indicators have been studied: 87 \ntotal organic carbon (TOC), leachable chlorides, organochlorides expressed as 88 \npentachlorobenzene (Cl5Bz) and hexachlorobenzene (Cl6Bz), and the heavy metals 89 \nCu, Cr, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Pb. Finally, XRD and SEM- EDS techniques are utilized for 90 \nthe mineralogical characterization of the produced fly ashes. These commonly applied 91 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nindicators have been employed to facilitate comparisons with other reported values in 92 \nliterature. The aim of this study is to assess whether the pollutants load of SRF 93 \nderived fly ashes is lower than the equivalent values reported in literature, from 94 \nconventional waste fuels, and\/ or traditional waste thermal treatment applications.  95 \n 96 \n2. Materials and methods 97 \n2.1. Feedstock properties  98 \nSRF derived from East London\u2019s Waste Authority, processed by a private contractor 99 \nwas the feedstock for the trial. The fuel is produced in a sequential separation, 100 \nshredding, and aerobically bio-drying MBT process, classified as a \u201cNCV 3; Cl 2; Hg 101 \n1\u201d class SRF. A batch of 100kg was sampled from the MBT plant and it was later 102 \nsub-sampled as a static pile, according to the relevant standard (CEN\/TS 15442, 2006) 103 \nfor the detailed investigation of proximate characteristics and chlorine content. The 104 \nremaining data on ultimate analysis (Table 1) were provided by the SRF producer 105 \nbased on routine quality analysis\/ quality control (QA\/QC).  106 \n<<Table 1>> 107 \n2.2. Fluidized bed combustion rig operating conditions 108 \nThe 50 kWth fluidized bed combustor that was used for the trial consisted of a screw 109 \nfeeding hopper, the main bed chamber (dimensions 175\u00d7 30\u00d7 30 cm), a secondary 110 \ncombustion chamber that leads to a vertical ash deposition compartment, a water heat 111 \nexchanger, a cyclone, and an exhaust fan prior to the stack. The bed area was filled 112 \nwith 30.2 kg of silica sand with particle size between 1.00 \u2013 0.5 mm (16\/30 grade, 113 \ndensity 1,556 g l\n-1\n), resulting to bed static dimensions of 30*30*15.35 cm.  The FBC 114 \nwas vacuumed the day before the experiment for the removal of residual ash and 115 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nparticles from previous trials. Furthermore, it was operated overnight, burning natural 116 \ngas for decontamination and start-up purposes. The rig was monitored by 19 K-type 117 \nthermocouples, CO, CO2, and O2 online gas monitoring systems. The SRF incoming 118 \nflow slightly varied throughout the trial with a mean value of 117g min\n-1\n and a lambda 119 \ncoefficient equal to 1.6. The duration of the test was 300 minutes and the bed 120 \ntemperature was at 800 \u00b1 20 \no\nC. The rig and the ashes sampling points are illustrated 121 \nin Figure 1. Detailed information on the experimental conditions are reported in 122 \nprevious work (Balampanis et al., 2008). 123 \n <<Figure 1>> 124 \n2.3. Analysis 125 \n2.3.1. Inorganic chlorine & chlorobenzenes 126 \nAfter the experiment, the rig was disassembled and the mixed silica sand\/ bed ash 127 \nwere collected, weighted, and emptied to a tank with deionised water. The tank was 128 \nmechanically agitated for 3 hours and 6 replicate samples were taken, centrifuged and 129 \nfiltrated. The horizontal chamber and cyclone ash were collected separately in clean 130 \npre- weighted vacuum bags. Ashes sampled from the horizontal chamber 131 \n(approximate size <1.2 mm) and ashes sampled from the cyclone (approximate size < 132 \n200 \u03bcm) (Figure 2) will be referred herein and after, as coarse fly ash and fine fly ash, 133 \nrespectively, according to the literature definitions (IAWG, 1997; Quina et al., 134 \n2008a). Six replicates of a gram each, of coarse and fine fly ash were diluted in 250 135 \nmL of deionised water and agitated for three hours. The mix was centrifuged and 136 \ndecanted and the filtrate was stored in polypropylene bottles, at 4 \no\nC for chloride 137 \nanions analysis (Dionex, UK- Ion Chromatographer, column: Ion Pac As9- HC 4*250 138 \nmm).  139 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nFor the determination of Cl5Bz and Cl6Bz the following procedure was employed. 140 \nSeven replicates of each ash type were spiked with extraction standards (800ng mL\n-1\n 141 \n1,3,5-tribromobenzene in toluene) and then digested with 100mL of 2M HCl. The mix 142 \nwas separated using vacuum filtration, and the cakes were washed with deionised 143 \nwater to reduce acidity, air-dried for 12h, and then extracted with Soxhlet using 144 \n200mL of toluene for 20h. The aqueous solutions were extracted three times with 145 \n100mL of dichloromethane per litre of solution, and the solvent extracts were washed 146 \ntwice with deionised water for pH adjustment (50% v\/v). The two extracts from each 147 \nsample were mixed, concentrated using a rotary evaporator (38 \no\nC, 68 mbar), filtered 148 \nthrough a multilayer silica gel column (anhydrous Na2SO4 , 10% AgNO3 silica gel, 149 \n20% H2SO4 silica gel, 40% H2SO4 silica gel, 30% KOH silica gel) and eluted with 150 \nhexane, double the height of the column.  The column\u2019s elutes were further 151 \nevaporated (35 \no\nC, 200 mbar) and finally concentrated to 1mL using a nitrogen flow 152 \nconcentrator. The samples were spiked again with recovery standards (100 \u00b5l of 153 \n1.6\u00b5g mL\n-1\n of 1,2 dichlorobenzene-d4) and analysed through GC-MS-SIM 154 \n(Instrument: Perkin Elmer- Autosystem XL\/Turbo Mass Gold; Column: Thames-155 \nRestek Rtx \u00ae- 1MS- 100% dimethyl polysiloxane column (length 15m, internal 156 \ndiameter 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm); Injection: 1 \u03bcl at a split ratio of 100:1; 157 \nIonisation mode: positive 70 eV; Oven temperature conditions: initial 50 \no\nC, rising 30 158 \no\nC min\n-1\n up to 125 \no\nC, and then 15 \no\nC min\n-1\n up to 300 \no\nC where it was held for 6 min). 159 \n 160 \n3.3.2. Heavy metals 161 \nStandard methods (ASTM, 2004) for the determination of heavy metals in combustion 162 \nresidues, involve the utilisation of hydrofluoric acid (HF).

Furthermore, the total content of heavy metals is not 165 \ndirectly related to the leaching potential of fly ash, when landfilled (Hyks et al., 166 \n2009). Thus, four HF free digestion methods were tested for their recoveries, using a 167 \ncertified reference material (CRM). The CRM was MSW incineration fly ash (BCR- 168 \n176R, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, 169 \nEC) and a summary of the digestion methods is presented in Table 2. 170 \n<<Table 2>> 171 \nAn Anton Parr Multiwave 3000 microwave oven unit was utilised for the microwave 172 \nassisted digestion (MWAD) methods (A, B, and C), and compared against standard 173 \nreflux with aqua regia (method D) (BSI, 1995). For method A, seven replicates of 400 174 \n\u00b11 mg CRM and a method blank were placed in the PTFE pressure vessels with 8 mL 175 \nof concentrated (15.8 M) nitric acid. The vessels were left 16 hours in a fume 176 \ncupboard to equilibrate, to avoid elevated pressures inside the vessels at the MWAD 177 \nstage. The following MWAD programme was applied: 20 minutes for the instrument 178 \nto reach 18 bar and 190 \no\nC, where held for 20 minutes and finally another 20 minutes 179 \nfor the vessels to cool down. The mixture was then filtered using 0.45\u00b5m Whatman 180 \ncellulose filter papers and diluted with ultra pure (MilliPore) water, to a fixed volume 181 \nof 100 mL. 182 \nMethod B was performed exactly as method A, but with a different acid mix: 5 mL of 183 \nnitric acid and 3mL of hydrogen peroxide (100 volumes). Method C was performed 184 \nexactly as method A, with the difference that ultrasonic waves were applied through a 185 \n600W probe (Langford Ultrasonics- Sonomatic), to test whether ultrasonication could 186 \nenhance the digestion reactions. 187 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nMethod D was tested on 7 CRM replicates of 3 \u00b1 0.001g each, and a method blank.  188 \nTwenty one mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 M) were added in 250mL 189 \nreaction flasks, followed by 7 mL of nitric acid. The mix was allowed to oxidise at 190 \nroom temperature for 16h, and then heated to reflux conditions for 2h. After cooling 191 \ndown, it was filtered (0.45 \u00b5m Whatman cellulose filter papers) and made up to 100 192 \nmL using ultra pure water. All chemicals were trace analysis grade and purchased 193 \nfrom Fischer Scientific UK. The quantification was achieved through a graphite 194 \nfurnace\/ flame- atomic absorption spectrometer (GF\/F-AAS) A-Analyst 800 Perkin 195 \nElmer instrument, equipped with an air\/ acetylene flame and an AS-90 autosampler. 196 \n 197 \n3.3.3. XRD, TOC & SEM- EDS analysis 198 \nThe coarse and fine fly ashes were also analysed for their total C,H,N, and TOC 199 \ncontent using an elemental analyser (Vario EL III), and further examined in a SEM- 200 \nEDS microscope (Philips XL 30) for their major elements determination. The mean 201 \nconcentration of elements (% wt> 1) in the SEM- EDS analysis was obtained from a 202 \nspectrum over a 4 mm\n2\n and 0.16 mm\n2 \narea for coarse and fine fly ash, respectively; 203 \nFurthermore, the reported deviations represents 4 different scans in smaller areas, on 204 \neach one of the quadrants of the originally scanned areas. Finally, XRD (Siemens ED 205 \n5005) analysis was employed for the determination of the ashes\u2019 crystaline phases. 206 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n4. Results and discussion 207 \n4.1. Inorganic chlorine and chlorobenzenes 208 \n Figure 3 demonstrates the amount of water soluble chlorides that leached from each 209 \nash type. As expected the bed ash contained the lowest levels of Cl as most of it was 210 \nvolatilised in the process to form HCl, Cl2, or Cl radicals. The bed ash contained an 211 \namount of non- combustibles that was visible in the bed material. These residues were 212 \nmostly glass fractions, ceramics, metals, stones etc., thus a rather abnormal and 213 \nheterogeneous distribution of chlorides in these particles should be expected. 214 \nAlthough the determination of chloride ions was made with a much greater liquid to 215 \nsolid (L\/S) ratio than characterisation protocols suggest (BSI, 2002), the bed ash, 216 \nbased on the leached Cl\n-\n, would be accepted for co-disposal in a non hazardous 217 \nlandfill (Cl\n-\n< 15,000 mg kg\n-1\n), according to the existing legislation (EC, 2002) for 218 \ngranular waste. According to the same legislation the coarse fly ash would be 219 \naccepted in a hazardous waste landfill without further treatment (Cl\n-\n< 25000 mg kg\n-1\n), 220 \nwhile fine fly ash would require further stabilisation before final disposal. 221 \nThe higher chlorinated benzenes (Cl5Bz, and Cl6Bz) were quantified as indicators for 222 \nthe organochloride load of the fly ashes. Indirect measurement of dioxins like 223 \ncompounds using Cl5Bz, and Cl6Bz is useful for process optimisation, control of 224 \nseparation efficiencies of the flues gases in cleaning devices and the control of 225 \nemissions levels. However, although indirect measurements can be performed at 226 \nlower cost than determination of PCDD\/Fs, the relationship between PCDD\/Fs and 227 \nthe indicator parameters is likely to be plant specific (\u00d6berg et al., 2008). The Cl5Bz 228 \nvalues ranged between 9\u00b1 3.9 ng g\n-1\n for coarse, and 15\u00b1 2.8 ng g\n-1 \nfor fine fly ash 229 \nwhile the equivalent Cl6Bz values ranged between 3.3\u00b1 2.8 ng g\n-1\n,\n \nand 8\u00b1 2 ng g\n-1\n, 230 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nrespectively. These figures correspond to the lower range of reported values on 231 \norganochlorides within the literature as it will be discussed at a later stage (section 232 \n4.4). 233 \n<<Figure 2>> 234 \n4.2. Heavy Metals 235 \nThe four HF-free fly ash digestion methods were compared for their recoveries of the 236 \nCRM and the results are reported in Figure 4. The overall recoveries ranged between 237 \n59% and 94%, except from Cr which ranged at lower levels ca. 19- 38%. A one way 238 \nANOVA at a confidence interval of 95%, confirmed that there was no single method 239 \nthat significantly recovered higher amounts for the whole range of the examined 240 \nmetals. However, some exceptions were found in method A, which recovered 241 \nsignificantly higher quantities of Pb, and in the aqua regia method (D), which 242 \nrecovered lower amounts of Cu, Cd and Pb. Furthermore, neither the addition of H2O2 243 \nin the digestion vessels, or ultrasonication as post-digestion treatment, improved the 244 \nrecovery of the metals. Thus, single step HNO3 MWAD proved sufficient for the 245 \nsolubilisation of heavy metals in waste derived fly ashes, as reported in older studies 246 \n(Mester et al., 1999; Quina et al., 2008b). 247 \n<<Figure 3>> 248 \nThe fly ashes were further analysed for their content in Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Zn 249 \nusing method A and the results are presented in Figure 5. Coarse fly ash contained 250 \nhigher Cu, Pb and Zn quantities than the fine fly ash fraction, which had higher Cr 251 \nand Ni contents. The Cd values were relatively low ranging at 3.6\u00b1 0.6 mg kg\n-1 \nand 252 \n7.3\u00b1 0.2 mg kg\n-1 \nfor fine and coarse fly ash, respectively. Finally, it should be noted 253 \nthat the actual concentration of Cr in both ash types could be higher than the ones 254 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \npresented in Figure 5, as the HF free digestion method used gives a relative poor 255 \nrecovery of the element according to the CRM recovery values. 256 \n<<Figure 4>> 257 \n4.3. Minerals and carbon 258 \nThe rough (%wt >1) composition of the elements in the ashes, as recognised in SEM-259 \nEDS analysis is presented in Table 3. Calcium, silicon, aluminium, chlorine, sodium, 260 \npotassium, iron, sulphur, and phosphorus were the most common elements, besides 261 \ncarbon, which ranged at 8.6\u00b1 0.1 % and 9.6\u00b1 0.2 % for the coarse and fine fly ash, 262 \nrespectively. This slight difference in the total carbon content is probably due to the 263 \ngreater residence time of the bigger and heavier coarse particles (Figure 2 a and b) in 264 \nthe combustion zone, resulting to higher C to CO2 conversion. This finding is 265 \nconfirmed by the TOC levels that ranged at 6\u00b1 0.4% and 6.8 \u00b1 0.1% for coarse and 266 \nfine fly ash particles. In respect to the SEM-EDS sensitivity, another conclusion is 267 \nthat fine fly ash had about double the amount of chlorine than the coarse one. This 268 \nfinding is confirmed by the amount of water soluble chlorides that leached from each 269 \nash type (section 4.1).  270 \nThe mineralogical analysis recognised the main crystal phases of the ashes by means 271 \nof XRD and the difractograms are presented in Figure 6. These were similar for both 272 \nash types: Calcite (CaCO3), quartz (SiO2), halite (NaCl), sylvite (KCl), and calcium 273 \nsulphate (CaSO4); except from calcium silicate (CaSiO4), which was only detected in 274 \nfine ash particles. The XRD pattern is similar to most MSWI fly ashes as reported in 275 \nother works (Wan et al., 2006; Quina et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2008; Shi and Kan, 276 \n2009) with the exception of calcium silicate. This finding is of particular importance 277 \nas layers of  CaSiO4 can interfere as heat transfer barriers in flame retardant 278 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \napplications (Hamdani et al., 2009), however its presence was not confirmed at the 279 \nheat- exchange tower (coarse fly ash sampling point), but only at the cyclone (fine fly 280 \nash collection point.  281 \n<<Table 3>> 282 \n<<Figure 5>> 283 \n<<Figure 6>> 284 \n4.4. Comparison of SRF fly ash with literature values 285 \nComparisons against literature values are often limited by the heterogeneity of 286 \navailable data, due to the complexity of the ash products, and the high number of 287 \navailable methods for residues characterisation, leaching protocols etc. Table 4 288 \npresents the toxicity indicators determined in this work, against equivalent values 289 \nfrom MSWI derived fly ashes in literature. The selection of the literature data was 290 \nbased on the quality of the reported results, and the methods used to obtain them. 291 \nThe results indicate lower levels of some pollutants in SRF- derived fly ashes 292 \ncompared to the reported values in literature. The chlorobenzenes in the examined 293 \nsamples range at an order of magnitude lower than other reported figures. The same 294 \nresult is obtained when comparing the heavy metals content of the SFR fly ashes with 295 \nthe equivalent metals load from other works; The levels of, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were 296 \nsignificantly lower than other reported values. Furthermore, the leached chlorides 297 \nlevels lay on the lowest reported ranges within literature. However, no particular 298 \ndifference was observed for Cr and Ni and TOC, which ranged at the same levels as 299 \nother researchers report.  300 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nThe reported values in literature might involve data from thermal treatment 301 \ntechnologies different than FBC, e.g. mass grate incineration, and can enhance the 302 \nheterogeneity of data. As reported in other works (Lind et al., 2007) when comparing 303 \ngrate firing and FBC, there were differences in the levels of As and Sb in the 304 \ngenerated fly ashes. However, the low Cl, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cl5Bz, and Cl6Bz presented 305 \nin Table 4 clearly reflect the low chlorine and metals content of the particular fuel. 306 \nThis fact indicates the importance of modern separation technologies that are used in 307 \nMBT plants for the removal of components rich in metals and chlorine like electronic 308 \nwaste and hard plastics, respectively, resulting to the removal of heavily polluted 309 \ncomponents from the combustible output fractions (Rotter et al., 2004).  310 \n<<Table 4>> 311 \n5. CONCLUSIONS 312 \nThe coarse and fine fly ashes produced from the fluidised bed combustion of a NCV 313 \n3, Cl 2, and Hg 1 class SRF have been characterised using commonly tested toxicity 314 \nindicators like TOC, Cd, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Cl5,6Bz, and water soluble Cl. Our 315 \nfindings indicate that SRF derived fly ashes have a similar mineralogical pattern with 316 \nother waste- derived fly ashes, with the exception of calcium silicate, which was only 317 \ndetected in the fine particles. 318 \nThe results, when compared with other literature values indicate that, these SRF 319 \nderived fly ashes have significantly lower values in Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, leachable Cl and 320 \norganochloride load than other traditional thermal treatment applications. This fact 321 \nhighlights the importance of modern separation technologies employed in MBT plants 322 \nfor the removal of components rich in metals and chlorine from the combustible 323 \noutput fraction of SRF. 324 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  325 \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of ENTRUST, Shanks Group plc. and 326 \nGrantscape Ltd. for the completion of this project.
