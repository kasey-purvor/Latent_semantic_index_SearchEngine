My claim is that ERP packages are predicated upon an understanding of human agency as a procedural affair and of organizations as an extended series of functional or cross-functional transactions. Accordingly, the massive introduction of ERP packages to organizations is bound to have serious implications that precisely recount the procedural forms by which such packages instrument organizational operations and fashion organizational roles. The conception of human agency and organizational operations in procedural terms may seem reasonable yet it recounts a very specific and, in a sense, limited understanding of humans and organizations.

The comprehensive character of \nthese packages and the issues their diffusion raises suggest that they presumably mark \na distinctive stage in the history of computer-based information technology\u2019s in-\nvolvement in organizations. There is a seemingly urgent and perhaps steadily acceler-\nating quest for bringing some sort of uniformity to the disparate ecology of applica-\ntions, operating systems and information management techniques that are commonly \n 2\nre-encountered across organizations. Interoperability of applications, smooth file shar-\ning, computer-based cooperative work and communication across institutional and \ngeographical boundaries are everyday demands in contemporary organizations. Most \nsignificantly, the integration of organizational operations in ways that address their \nfunctional interdependencies in real time is increasingly becoming a crucial yet recal-\ncitrant issue for many organizations (Ciborra et al., 2000; Fleck, 1994; Markus et al., \n2000a, 2000b).  \n \nLarge-scale information packages respond precisely to this quest for achieving some \nsort of integration across functions, departments and task modules. Enterprise Re-\nsource Planning (ERP) systems present a common and widespread manifestation of \nthese developments. Systems of this sort are believed to help organizations overcome \nthe fragmentation of domain-limited management information systems through the \nconstruction of a relatively unified, organizational-wide software platform. Enterprise \nResource Planning systems exhibit a modular architecture that by and large coincides \nwith the conventional functional segmentation of organizations (Kumar and Van Hil-\nlegersberg, 2000). However, the standardization of information requirements and in-\nformation processing permits inter-modular transference of data and the tying of op-\nerations across modules (i.e. cross-functional processes). In this respect, ERP systems \ncan be used as an administrative framework for planning, conducting and monitoring \na large array of functionally segmented operations in ways that both accommodate in \nreal time the intrinsic cross-functional interdependencies underlying these operations, \nand enable their posterior retracing and control. \n \nIn this paper I seek to lay open a set of implicit yet crucial organizational and behav-\nioural premises onto which large-scale information packages such as ERP systems are \nbuilt. More specifically, I focus on the impact ERP packages may have in promoting a \nprocedural vision of organization and human agency in work settings. Enterprise Re-\nsource Planning packages represent a powerful means for segmenting, organizing and \ncarrying out work in organizations. They establish distinctions and work items \nthroughout the organization, connect them within and across functions, bring about \nstandardization in input and output data and set up elaborate procedures to be fol-\nlowed with respect to the execution of organizational tasks.  \n \nEnterprise Resource Planning packages are particularly germane in influencing hu-\nman agency at work. A distinctive characteristic of information systems of this sort is \nthe reconstruction of the very micro-ecology of organizational tasks to which any sin-\ngle transaction belongs. In the world ERP systems help bring about there are no iso-\n 3\nlated acts. Any single organizational transaction impinges upon one or other aspect of \norganizational life and its effects must thus be accounted for. Transactional interde-\npendencies are thus carefully defined or recorded and their execution becomes \naccordingly codified. By recording and interlinking organizational transactions, ERP \npackages provide the information infrastructure that enables the sharpening awareness \nof the effects which one\u2019s actions may have on others and indirectly on oneself. En-\nterprise Resource Planning packages bring thus the dream of a wide organizational \ntransparency\/visibility (Zuboff, 1988) a step further into its technological perfection. \nAny organizational change from the most minute (e.g. goods movement in the ware-\nhouse) to the most encompassing (e.g. production rescheduling) are recorded and their \norganizational impact on others are captured through interface connections to other \nmodules or sub-modules (Fleck, 1994). Furthermore, ERP packages shape human \nagency at work by proactively stipulating the steps that have to be followed in order \nfor a transaction to be properly executed.  \n \nFor instance, vendor evaluation in the SAP\/R3 Materials Management module com-\nprises the following criteria for evaluating suppliers: price, quality, delivery, general \nservice and external service (Bancroft et al., 1996). The information about the suppli-\ners recorded in the database is structured along these dimensions and the system pro-\nvides, in addition, information about the past performance of suppliers. This way the \nsystem stipulates the steps though which the evaluation of suppliers (a subtask within \nthe wider task of choosing and placing an order) must take place. At the same time, \nthe link of placing an order to Financial Accounting and Controlling modules and the \nWarehouse Management sub-module help establish the awareness of the effects one\u2019s \nchoices may have on others and the organization (Bancroft et al., 1996; Ptak and \nSchragenheim, 2000; Soh et al., 2000) It is in these respects that organizational-wide \ninformation systems move a step further in shaping human agency in organizations \nthan traditional MIS or expert systems. \n \nThe assumption that ERP packages may be instrumental in shaping human agency in \norganizations may easily be dismissed as deterministic these days (Orlikowski, 2000). \nTo enter that discussion would lead us astray, however, from the major issues this pa-\nper seeks to address (see, e.g., Kallinikos, 1966, 2002; Kling, 1992). Claiming that \nERP packages influence patterns of cognition, action and communication in organiza-\ntions is not equivalent to saying that ERP packages unambiguously determine human \nbehaviour in organizations. Still, ERP packages have profound effects on the structur-\ning of work and the forms of human action they enable or constraint. In this respect \nthe article joins a longstanding tradition in social research focusing on the relationship \n 4\nbetween technology and human behaviour in general (e.g. Mumford, 1934, 1952, \n1970; Noble, 1984; Perrow, 1967, 1986; Winner, 1977, 1984) and information tech-\nnology and organizational behaviour in particular (e.g. Beniger, 1986; Kling, 1996; \nOrlikowski et al., 1996; Zuboff, 1988). \n \nA few crucial presuppositions of the present work need to be spelled out here at the \noutset. In this article, ERP packages are treated as independent products capable of \nbeing analyzed in their own right, without reference to the contextual dynamics by \nwhich they are often reshaped and their functionality reconfigured. This is not an un-\ncontroversial stance but one that has, alas, to be part of the agenda of research on ERP \npackages or any other information system whatsoever. Analyzing ERP packages in \nthese terms does not by necessity discard or downplay the significance which the im-\nplementation process may have in reshaping these packages to the demands of par-\nticular organizations. Implementation, as Fleck (1994)\u2019s seminal article has success-\nfully demonstrated, is not a procedure of unproblematic installation but rather a com-\nplex socio-technical process of renegotiation and redevelopment. However, no matter \nhow important, the changes brought about during the implementation phase do not \nexhaust the effects ERP packages have on particular settings. Many of these modifica-\ntions are performed upon an anterior system of solutions which any ERP package em-\nbodies and which is heavily conditioned by the historical trajectory of ERP technol-\nogy in general and the organizational philosophy onto which it is predicated (Kal-\nlinikos, 2004). \n \nDrawing on these ideas, I would like to argue that the abstract, context-free analysis \nof large-scale, integrative information packages is justifiable on several counts. First, \ncontextual adaptation and reshaping of such packages cannot undo the logic and the \nvery presuppositions on which the package is predicated. For instance, other criteria \nmay be added by particular organizations to those which we referred to above in con-\nnection with vendor evaluation. But the evaluation is still made and justified by re-\ncourse to a number of discrete criteria, and the information which the system is capa-\nble of providing. Other forms of evaluation based, say, on loyalty or opportunism, ho-\nlistic or tacit information not possible to supply through the system are thus forgone \nor become subordinated to the logic the system embodies (Fleck, 1994). Secondly, \ncontextual adaptation is conditioned by characteristics of technology that become \nblack-boxed and thus escape or withstand deliberate manipulation (Fleck, 1994; \nKling, 1992). ERP packages in particular are solidified technologies whose complex-\nity usually transcends the ability of particular organizations to rework the source code, \nreprogram or redefine the logic on which any such package is based. Thirdly, the ade-\n 5\nquate understanding of the issues occasioned by any technology, not just ERP sys-\ntems, entails the depiction of common elements that cut across specific cases. Expla-\nnation always involves the appreciation of the general in the specific (Cassirer, 1955), \nand the context-free analysis of particular technologies is particularly well suited to \nthis project. To these factors one may perhaps add the complex institutional and eco-\nnomic relations by which ERP packages are sustained (Hanseth, 2000; Sawyer and \nSouthwick, 2002) and which are hardly negotiable in situ.  \n \nReflecting these preoccupations, I seek in this paper to approach and analyze ERP \npackages independently of the ways by which they may be contextually reshaped dur-\ning the process of implementation. The ultimate purpose is to attempt to disclose the \nlogic or action \u201cphilosophy\u201d onto which these systems are predicated, and to lay open \nthe forms of human agency, organization and work which they seem to implicate. \nPrior to it, however, a brief review of current research on ERP and information infra-\nstructures is undertaken. The review suggests that the critical examination of the or-\nganizational and behavioural foundations of large-scale information systems to re-\nmain by and large an uncharted territory. \n \n \nRelevant Research \nDespite the relatively recent emergence of large-scale information packages, there \nexists currently a rather extensive literature that identifies various problems or issues \nthat seem to be associated with their organizational involvement. Indeed, this litera-\nture is fairly heterogeneous and comprises several strands of thought and practice. \n \nTo begin with, a technical or quasi-technical literature with strong managerial focus \nhas sought to provide the guidelines for the successful implementation of information \nplatforms as those exemplified by ERP packages. The major concern of this literature \nhas been the development of methodologies, tools and techniques necessary to ac-\ncomplish this goal (e.g., Bancroft et al., 1996; O\u2019Leary, 2000; Ptak and Schragen-\nheim, 2000). While being concerned with the entire range of questions relating to the \nimplementation of ERP packages, the technical-managerial literature cannot but ad-\ndress the working practices, operating procedures and the human skills necessary to \ndeploy this technology successfully. After all, the implementation of ERP packages \ndemands the \u201creengineering\u201d of the organization. This by necessity implies new \nmethods for designing tasks, jobs and work modules and leads to new work structures \nand procedures. However, these issues are framed in strictly technical terms. Despite \nthe inevitable focus on issues of work, the behavioural assumptions underlying the \n 6\nimplementation of ERP systems are never examined in this rather technical literature. \nThe definition of tasks and their chaining to larger sequences or processes, the \nconstruction of roles centred around these processes, and the constitution of human \nagency along distinct lines that may reflect the meticulous segmentation of work and \nthe overall architecture of packages are not given particular attention (e.g., Markus et \nal., 2000b). \n \nA quite distinct research agenda has been documenting various problems and issues \nrelating to the introduction of ERP packages in organizations. Major attention has \nbeen given to factors influencing the successful implementation of ERP packages, e.g. \nthe size of the package and the number of users concerned (Francalanci, 2001; Kumar \net. al., 2001; Markus et al., 2000b; Parr and Schanks, 2000; Scheer and Habermann, \n2000), the pattern of implementation activities and its temporal effects (Sawyer and \nSouthwick 2002), the significance of organizational and national cultures (Krumbholz \net al., 2000; Soh et al., 2000) and learning (Fleck, 1994; Parr and Schanks, 2000), and \nthe patterns of knowledge transfer from the supplier to the host organization (Lee and \nLee, 2000; Parr and Schanks, 2000). Other studies have investigated the significance \nof the designing methodologies, as these are reflected in the overall architecture of the \npackage and the flexibility this last provides for rapid environmental adaptation (Fan \net al., 2000; Sprott, 2000). There are in many of these studies occasional comments on \nthe effects of long driven standardization brought about by ERP technology and the \nrestructuring of organizational tasks along the lines suggested by \u201creengineering\u201d \n(see, e.g. Kumar and Van Hillegersberg, 2000). A few studies focus on specific be-\nhavioural aspects, i.e. the relationship between national and organizational culture and \nERP implementation and use (Krumbholz et al., 2000; Soh et al., 2000), the temporal \neffects upon work and organizational patterns associated with ERP implementation \n(Sawyer and Southwick, 2002) or the influence ERP systems may have on organiza-\ntional structures and processes (Markus et al., 2000a; Soh et al., 2000). And yet, the \ndetailed investigation of the constitutive effects, which ERP packages have upon \nwork, human agency and organizational action does not receive systematic attention.  \n \nIt is impossible to do justice to such a wide and heterogeneous literature. But it would \nnot be unfair to say that, with a few exceptions (e.g., Fleck, 1994; Sawyer and South-\nwick, 2002), the overwhelming majority of the mentioned studies exhibit an unambi-\nguous prescriptive orientation. They are by and large concerned with depicting the \nfactors that may inhibit the successful implementation of ERP systems and develop-\ning guidelines for selecting, implementing successfully and managing such systems. \nWider issues relating to the nature of work and its transformations as well as the \n 7\nstructural templates by which work has been historically accommodated and which \nERP systems impinge upon (Engestrom and Middleton, 1966; Kling, 1996; Lamb and \nKling, 2003; Zuboff, 1988) have been bypassed or ignored by this rather restrictive \nmanagerial literature.  \n \nA different set of preoccupations is reflected in the work of Ciborra and his associates \n(see, e.g. Ciborra et al., 2000; Ciborra and Hanseth, 1998). Drawing on a limited \nnumber of intensive case studies, Ciborra and his associates have showed large infor-\nmation packages of infrastructures, as they call them, to be only partly subject to de-\nliberate manipulation and planning. A complex tangle of technological interdepend-\nencies (some technologies or components fit only with certain others) combines with \nthe needs for standards across various component technologies to limit discretion and \nthe space of choices. Furthermore, the technological, organizational and social em-\nbeddedness of the various components of technology (each component is embedded \nin a complex network of other technologies, commercial interests and social practices \nexternal to the organization) join the other constraints to make technology a recalci-\ntrant ally. All these factors together tend to produce unexpected outcomes. Solution of \nproblems in one domain may export them in other domains or recreate them at an \neven more comprehensive level. Often, the accumulation of side effects drifts the im-\nplementation of large scale information packages along directions that were never \nimagined at the very moment of their inception into organizations. Integration is sub-\nject to double-bind effects. It both enables and undermines purposeful action. Similar \nobservations have been delivered by Fleck (1994) in one of the earliest implementa-\ntion studies of large scale information packages.  \n \nThe studies mentioned so far represent but a sample of the contemporary literature \nthat has been occasioned by the growing organizational involvement of large-scale \nintegrative packages. However, the review is indicative of the very questions that \nhave received the overwhelming attention so far. The review also shows that the im-\nplementation of ERP packages and the integration (or the limits to which integration \nis subject) of organizational operations have largely defined the agenda of questions \nrelating to the introduction of these packages into organizations. The reconstitution of \norganizational functions, work duties and process along lines that reflect the overall \nphilosophy and architecture of integrative packages have only been mentioned in \npassing. Accordingly, their implications for modes of human agency and work have \nlargely been overlooked.  \n \n 8\nOn the basis of a broader historical evaluation of technology (e.g., Beniger, 1986; \nMumford, 1934, 1970; Noble, 1984; Perrow, 1967; Winner, 1977, 1993), it is possible \nto conjecture that the organizational involvement of integrative packages accom-\nplishes much more than the sheer coordination of organizational operations. It too re-\nconfigures the design and execution of organizational tasks, shapes the work envi-\nronment of employees, and impinges upon their behaviour (Kling, 1996; Zuboff, \n1988). As already suggested, large-scale technologies of integration segment organ-\nizational tasks in specific ways, they combine them into sequences, often extended \nacross functions and task modules. They do so in terms that cannot help but reflect a \nnumber of assumptions concerning human involvement in organizations. Brought into \nparticular settings, such packages cannot but influence process and structural tem-\nplates of organizations, and the forms by which human agents come to relate to the \nobject of their work and to one another. On the one hand, the information items, se-\nquences and procedures that underlie large-scale integrative packages structure and \ndirect attention. On the other hand, they shape modes of communication, interaction \nand work. Enterprise Resource Planning systems in particular promote a very specific \nvision of what an organization is. Such a vision is most clearly reflected in the con-\nception of organizations as an extended series of procedural transactions. In this proc-\ness they construe work, human intervention and agency in very specific ways that \nneed to be brought under scrutiny.  \n \n \nOrganizational Premises of ERP Systems \nAs already noted, ERP packages address issues of organizational integration across \nfunctions and locations. Organized in function modules that draw on common data-\nbases, ERP packages establish inter-modular connections that recapture the cross-\nfunctional interdependencies of organizational operations. At the same time, the \nmodular architecture of the package allows for functional autonomy and flexibility \nthat address the specific requirements of each function. Gauged in sheer technical \nterms of information processing, the overall architecture of ERP systems introduces \nsignificant innovations. However, placed in the wider context of the variety of organ-\nizational practices and the structural blueprints that have been known to accommodate \norganizations (Ciborra, 1996; Hedlund, 1986; Mintzberg, 1979; Nonaka, 1994), ERP \ntechnology definitely appears less innovative. Let me explain this claim. \n \nThe organizational blueprint onto which ERP technology is predicated seems to re-\ncount a rather traditional understanding of organizations. Indeed, organizations are \nconceived as systems being composed of major groups of activities that, by and large, \n 9\ncoincide with the conventional functional segmentation of organizations, i.e. produc-\ntion, marketing, product development, purchasing and warehousing, human resource \nmanagement, finance and accounting (see, e.g. Mintzberg, 1979, 1983; Wigand et al., \n1997). Major operational modules in ERP packages available in the market today are \nbased on this functional understanding of organizations. This rather traditional way of \nconceiving organizations is furthermore re-enhanced by the establishment of more \nnarrowly defined categories that break functions down into sub-functional domains. \nFor instance, the SAP\/R3 Human Resource module establishes sub-functional catego-\nries such as \u201cPay roll, benefits administration, applicant data administration, person-\nnel development planning, work-force planning, schedule and shift planning, time \nmanagement, and travel expense accounting\u201d (Bancroft et al., 1996: 33). Organiza-\ntional functions and sub-functions are thus crucial building blocks of ERP packages \n(Kumar and Van Hillegesberg, 2000; Markus et al., 2000a). \n \nHowever, ERP technology is often acclaimed to proceed further from this conven-\ntional view of organizations in that it provides the means for connecting operations \nacross functions (O\u2019Leary, 2000; Ptak and Schragenheim, 2000). The successful inte-\ngration of the temporal, functional and structural differentiation of organizational op-\nerations presupposes the restructuring of organizational operations that the ERP pack-\nage is brought to bear upon along the lines suggested by \u201creengineering\u201d (Bancroft et \nal., 1996; O\u2019Leary, 2000; Ptak and Schragenheim, 2000). Now, \u201creengineering\u201d de-\nmands the establishment of cross-functional processes in ways that provide a clear \norientation towards the market or any other crucial external referent of the organiza-\ntion. The many discrete steps that make up the production of goods and services (i.e. \nfunction and sub-functions) must thus be defined and tied together so as to make the \njourney towards the ultimate or intermediate destinations, i.e. the customer of the or-\nganization or other units of the same organization, as smooth as possible. A process \nview of organization, assumed to provide the means for responding to the demands of \nthe market or other internal constituents, is thus juxtaposed to the conventional func-\ntionally based organizational structure and its inward orientation.  \n \nAnd yet, at a closer scrutiny, this picture seems to be rather idealized and the claims \ntied to it strongly overstated. The identification of functional and cross-functional \nprocesses and their system codification reflects as much the technical prerequisites of \ncomputer automation as it presumably does the demands to market adaptation. Enter-\nprise Resource Planning technology, as perhaps any technology, reconstitutes \norganizational operations only after it has broken them down into the most minute \ndetail. The meticulous definition of data items, the precise identification of \ntransactional steps, and the fashioning of such steps into clearly described sequences \n 10\nsteps, and the fashioning of such steps into clearly described sequences that cover the \noperations of the entire organization are essential to ERP packages. However, the se-\nquential unfolding of organizational tasks does not necessarily coincide with what is \noften referred to as business process. Indeed, it could be conjectured that the larger the \nnumber of steps that define a sequence, the more difficult would it be to discern the \ndirection pattern of the sequence and infer the purpose of each step. The details into \nwhich the completion of the various operations (e.g. warehousing, accounting) are \nimmersed increase the risk of these operations being cut from their ultimate destina-\ntion (e.g. customer satisfaction). \n \nIt is thus of utmost importance to stress that ERP systems recount a conception of or-\nganizations as a huge series of procedural steps, tied together to sequences, sub-\nfunctional categories, modules and cross-modular operations. The unspoken or hidden \npremise onto which ERP systems are predicated assumes that organizational opera-\ntions can ultimately be reduced to a large series of procedural steps. On this account, \norganizing is no more than the mechanics by which these steps are brought together \nand coordinated. Beyond this processual focus, other forms of human involvement at \nwork and organizational practices, hard to pin down yet crucial to the ways things are \ndone in particular settings, are thereby ignored and bypassed (Fleck, 1994; Soh et al., \n2000). The syntax of ERP systems just entails carefully defined data items, transac-\ntional steps and rules for bringing them into various combinations. Placed in such a \ncontext, the meaning of process tends, in fact, to dissolve into that of procedure, i.e. a \nlinear sequence of discrete transactional steps necessary to accomplish a certain task \n(Sawyer and Southwick, 2002).  \n \nThese claims can be exemplified by reference to any of the commercially available \nERP packages. The SAP\/R3 Materials Management module, for instance, divides the \ntotality of operations relevant to the identification, procurement and internal distribu-\ntion of inputs into the following eight data\/action categories: purchasing, external \nservices management, vendor evaluation, inventory management, invoice verification, \nwarehouse management, consumption based planning and material ledger. Each of \nthese categories or steps are further broken down into subcategories or steps. Inven-\ntory management, for instance, is composed of the following data or action subcatego-\nries: material master, data inventory management, goods movement, environment, \nplanning goods receipts, goods receipts for purchased orders, reservations, goods \nissues, transfer posting and stock transfer, print functions and physical inventory. \nEven these subcategories are broken down into minute data items of steps. For in-\nstance the subcategory good issues identifies the following distinct groups of opera-\n 11\ntions: deliveries to customers, withdrawal of material for production orders, other \ninternal staging of material, return deliveries to vendors, scrapping and sampling \n(Bancroft et al., 1996).  \n \nNow it is well known that the design of computer-based information systems in gen-\neral is predicated on the meticulous segmentation of the operations that these systems \nare called upon to monitor (see, e.g., Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986; Newell and Simon, \n1981; Zuboff, 1988). Such meticulous segmentation of the object world upon which \nthe system is brought to bear is essential for defining the data items, the steps and the \nrules by which they are combined into transactional sequences. Enterprise Resource \nPlannning systems cannot differ in this respect. The proceduralization then of organi-\nzations could be seen as the inevitable outcome of computer-based automation in gen-\neral rather than the outcome of the distinctive logic underlying ERP systems. True as \nit may be, such an assertion tends to conceal that ERP systems accentuate some of the \nproblems intrinsic to procedural standardization. Due to their comprehensiveness and \ndepth, ERP systems tend to construe almost the entire scale of organizational opera-\ntions (rather than particular operations or tasks) as an extensive series of transactional \nsteps. After all, ERP technology aims at mapping organization-wide flows and trans-\nactions rather than constructing domain-limited information systems. \n \nThe conception of organizations in procedural terms is almost certain to have far-\nreaching implications. That is, the comprehensive pre-structuring of data items and \nthe detailed specification of procedures (i.e. pre-programming of execution patterns) \ninevitably reduce the space of open, people to people encounters. They also impose \nsignificant constraints to less structured ways by which humans may relate to their \nwork and work objects (Fleck, 1994; Sawyer and Southwick, 2002). They thus con-\nstrue organizational behaviour in terms of procedure enactment. While responding to \nthe demands of predictability and control, the procedural standardization of organiza-\ntions, which ERP systems promote, considerably simplify the forms by which organ-\nizational action develops. Rather than unfolding as prearranged sequences of steps \n(Kallinikos, 1996; Lamb and Kling, 2003; Lindblom, 1981), organizational action en-\ntails holistic patterns of cognition and open encounters marked by sidesteps, unpre-\ndictable turns and improvization that defeat straightforward procedural standardiza-\ntion (Ciborra, 1999; March and Olsen, 1989; Weick, 1979a, 1979b, 1993). However, \nbefore we turn to the closer examination of these aspects of organizational action, we \nneed briefly return to the issue of the external orientation of organizations commonly \ntied to the organizational involvement of ERP packages.  \n \n 12\n \nFunctional Prerequisites versus External Adaptation \nAs already indicated, the meticulous and comprehensive segmentation of organiza-\ntional operations underlying ERP packages may indeed work at cross-purposes with \nthe goals of customer satisfaction and market adaptation. Despite assertions to the \ncontrary, the huge number of procedural steps that define the system may impede the \nultimate purpose of responding successfully to the demands of the environment. In the \nmeticulously parsed universe of ERP systems, the ultimate goal of responding to ex-\nternal conditions may easily be lost in the maze of transactions that reconstruct or-\nganizations as extensive procedural fields. Concern with internal processes may ob-\nscure and finally replace external adaptation. \n \nIt is often suggested that the distinction between core and support processes helps re-\nstore the sense of external orientation that may become impeded by the huge number \nof steps that constitute the package. Contemporary students of practice note boldly \nthat, in most organizations, core processes, i.e. processes that are responsible for the \nmajor building blocks of an organization\u2019s products or services, range from half to \none dozen (Bancroft et al., 1996; Ptak and Schragenheim, 2000). True-sounding as \nthis may seem, such a claim adopts the viewpoint of key actors in organizations. The \ndistinction between core and support processes makes sense from the viewpoint of \nthose that can obtain a bird-eye view of organizational operations. By contrast, those \nthat lack such a wider perspective may become overwhelmed by the cognitive com-\nplexity of the package and lose sight of the wider purpose their contributions are sup-\nposed to serve (Kallinikos, 1999). Observations of the author and others across sev-\neral organizations implementing ERP packages re-enforce the finding that the ordi-\nnary user tends to turn their back to cognitive complexity, retreating instead into their \nown limited and seemingly controllable zone of duties (March and Olsen, 1989; \nTurkle, 1995; Zuboff, 1988). In this sense, the comprehensive character of ERP pack-\nages is prone to reintroduce the very fragmentation and sub-optimization that they \nhave set out to combat. It is well known that the loss of the perspective into which \nparticular transactions must be placed is among the principal reasons for sub-\noptimization, and people\u2019s concomitant inability to perceive the role they have to play \nwithin the greater organizational system (March and Simon, 1958; Mintzberg, 1979; \nPerrow, 1986). \n \nThe internal orientation of SAP\/R3 (the dominant and perhaps most sophisticated \nERP package in the market) has been widely acknowledged (see, e.g., Davenport, \n1998; Fan et al., 2000; Gartner Group, 2000; Sprott, 2000). The comprehensive char-\n 13\nacter of ERP systems plays an important role in the very internal orientation which \nsoftware packages of this sort are bound to exhibit. The many date items, transac-\ntional steps and processes must be fashioned into a working whole, a task that cannot \nbe accomplished unless the system accommodates its internal relations and dependen-\ncies (Kallinikos, 1999). Underneath, the demands for standards or gateways through-\nout the organization prompt the accommodation of component technologies to one \nanother (Hanseth, 2000). These observations suggest that the major issue at stake in \nERP systems is not the external orientation of organizations, as the official rhetoric of \nERP vendors and consultants often implies. Rather, the key question is to find a sur-\nrogate depiction model of organizational operations that captures the ongoing charac-\nter (as opposed to the static, structural mapping of organizations) of a huge number of \norganizational transactions, in order to explore and control the ways they ramify and \nbear upon one another (Kling, 1996).  \n \nEnterprise Resource Planning packages are basically concerned with dissecting the \ncomplex texture of organizing into discrete steps with the ultimate purpose of raising \nthe manageability of organizations. The project of depicting the interdependent char-\nacter of organizational operations and the way the various tasks and the information \nthey generate bear upon one another is motivated by the desire to render the entire \nsystem of internal relations predictable and controllable. Though dressed in the fash-\nionable rhetoric of business processes and market adaptation in the age of the internet, \nERP packages are basically inward looking (Kumar and Van Hillegesberg, 2000), be-\ning concerned with tying together the overwhelming part of the internal relations and \nactivities of an organization. The primary goal is less to contribute to the adaptability \nof the organization to external contingencies than to build a detailed map of the organ-\nizational territory that can be used as the springboard for organizational action. In the \nlast resort, ERP packages aim at raising the manageability\/control\/predictability of the \norganizational system\u2019s routine operations. This could be a noble goal but one that has \nto be explicitly acknowledged (Beniger, 1986; Kallinikos, 1996; Kling, 1996).  \n \nThese claims suggest that that the organizational involvement of ERP packages is \nbound to have implications that derive from the predominantly inward-looking orien-\ntation of such packages, and the very organizational premises on which they are \npredicated. Enterprise Resource Planning systems imply the comprehensive design of \nitems, relations and operations moulded into a management model that could be \nbrought to bear on any organization (Soh et al., 2000). It is obvious that the design of \nsuch a system is based on an abstracted, shorthand version, no matter how rich in de-\ntails, of organizational operations. It therefore represents a decontextualized (i.e. de-\n 14\nprived from particular characteristics) accomplishment that can, in the best case, be \nadjusted a posteriori to fit the circumstances of the particular organization, whose \ntasks the ERP package is called upon to monitor (Fleck, 1994).  \n \nNow the vendor\/consultant industry built around the commercial exploitation and im-\nplementation of ERP packages would make the claim that a package of this sort can-\nnot be brought to bear on the management of an organization, unless the tasks and \nprocesses underlying the host organization are studied in detail. It is only through \nsuch a detailed study that the package can be adapted to the specific contingencies \nfacing that organization. The effort and the time spent (several years) for adapting \nERP packages to particular organizations suggest that their implementation consti-\ntutes a complex venture that cannot be brought into being unless significant portions \nof the package are negotiated locally.  \n \nHow genuine such an adaptation to local circumstances may become is an issue that \nfalls outside the scope of this article. As indicated in the introduction, there is defi-\nnitely variation on the extent to which implementation processes may reshape such \noff-the-shelf information packages. But there exist powerful constraints as well \n(Fleck, 1994; Kallinikos, 2002; Soh et al., 2000). The systemic character, the proce-\ndural logic and the overall outlook of ERP packages as described above cannot be un-\ndone through contextual adaptation. Enterprise Resource Planning packages are not \ninfinitely malleable (Hanseth, 2000; Hanseth and Bra, 2000). Indeed, it may be con-\njectured that the rituals surrounding the implementation of an ERP package (see, e.g., \nAvital and Vandenbosch, 2000; Bancroft et al., 1996) are by and large oriented to-\nwards transcribing the reality of particular organizations into the language of the \npackage rather than the other way around. Complex as it may be, the implementation \nprocess by means of which ERP packages are reconfigured, changed or adapted to \nlocal contexts is subject to polyvalent constraints (Kallinikos, 2004).  \n \n \nHuman Agency as Procedure Enactment \nThe observations to this point suggest that the implications of ERP packages reach far \nbeyond the officially acclaimed goal of rendering the organizational operations tidy, \nvisible and integrated. By providing the infrastructural means for tracing cause-effect, \nmeans-end relationships across the organization, ERP packages help construct a man-\nageable\/predictable organizational reality. At the same time, the procedural character \nof ERP technology, outlined in the two preceding sections, imposes itineraries of ac-\ntion, i.e. elaborate execution schemes necessary to accomplish a task or group of \n 15\ntasks. Now, a distinctive characteristic of all technologies is precisely the reshaping of \nhuman contributions along the lines suggested by the technological sequences (Beni-\nger, 1986; Noble, 1984). In this respect, ERP technology resembles any other tech-\nnology. It codifies routine or semi routine operations and standardizes their execution. \n \nUnlike other software packages, however, the conception of organizational operations \nas an extended sequence of discrete steps brings into being a \u201cbehavioural mechanics\u201d \nthroughout the organization. In dissecting organizational operations in discrete items \nand providing the procedural sequences for the execution of particular tasks, encom-\npassing computer-based applications, like the one ERP packages represent, engrave \nthe paths along which human contributions should unfold. In this respect they help \ninstitute patterns of action and communication and shape human agency in organiza-\ntions. The old debate concerning the effects of expert systems on professional behav-\niour (e.g., Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986; Goranzon, 1992; Winograd, 1990) is partly ap-\nplicable in the case of ERP technology. However, ERP systems target not knowledge \nand modes of inference but rather procedures of action and execution. In this respect, \nthe introduction of this family of technologies to organizations has less ambitious \ngoals than the computer-based codification of expert behaviour. They are mainly con-\ncerned with the procedural systematization, standardization and computer-based in-\nstrumentation of organizational operations. In so doing, ERP systems become an im-\nportant means for constructing governable and accountable patterns of behaviour in \norganizations (Kallinikos, 1996; Miller and O\u2019Leary, 1987, 1994). \n \nSimply put, ERP packages cannot but construct modes of human involvement as they \ngo about integrating organizational transactions. Application packages of this sort do \nnot simply recapture organizational operations in an organization-wide surrogate \nmodel. They definitely do so, yet with the ultimate purpose of inducing human action \nand directing it along certain lines. More than recording transactions, ERP packages \nare technologies of action. They define items and discrete transactional acts and con-\nstrue relations between them. In so doing, they combine them into extended sequences \nthat are vested with a sort of purpose and direction. For instance, the buying of input \nmaterials through the system obeys a strict procedural order. It involves inspection of \na number of relevant data items, the making of the final decision and the following up \nof the delivery, e.g. checking available inventory, reviewing supplier catalogues, \ncomparing prices and terms of delivery, ordering, following up delivery, etc. Most \nsignificantly, the procedural sequence takes place now with a clear awareness of the \ngreater ecology of relations (e.g. accounting and finance, operations and warehouse \nmanagement) upon which it tends to impinge, and which the system renders visible \n 16\nand possible to inspect and trace at any moment. In this respect, the influence of the \nsystem cannot adequately be gauged in terms of support to the user. Rather, large-\nscale, proactively oriented systems, like those ERP exemplify, invite highly selective \nmodes of participation (compliance to the procedural logic, the data items and \ntransactions the system entails) that block alternative ways of going about \n(Hasselbaldh and Kallinikos, 2000).  \n \nThus, ERP packages are distinguished by the insertion of every transaction they help \ndefine or record into the wider ecology of organizational relations to which each \ntransaction impinges or is linked to. By tying steps together and placing separate tasks \nand contributions within the wider context of other tasks or missions, ERP packages \ntend to shape considerably building blocks of organizational action such as jobs and \nroles. Rather than being simply descriptive, ERP packages are normative or, more \ncorrectly, performative in their orientation. That is, they do not simply automate and \nintegrate transactions. They, in addition, frame the import such transactions may have \nby placing them in the wider organizational context to which the designers of the sys-\ntem construe that they belong. The very meaning of \u201cbest practices\u201d onto which ERP \npackages are claimed to be based indicates that the target of such packages are ways \nof doing rather than the sheer codification, automation and integration of transactions.  \n \nThe reconstruction and retracing of the interconnected nature of organizational tasks \nthus makes ERP technology capable of constructing extended action itineraries. It is \nthus important to stress that ERP packages are underlain by a profound actant consti-\ntution. Functional modules, sub-functional categories and cross-functional processes \nare not simply depictions of information flows but also and perhaps predominantly \nexecution schemes. In this respect, ERP systems differ from traditional information \nsystems but also the automated versions of human action we call expert or decision \nsupport systems. They definitely entail the shaping of larger enclaves of tasks and \nprovide the informational and transactional infrastructure upon which procedural \nmodes of conduct are constituted. \n \nThe distinctive behavioural implications of ERP technology emerge against the back-\nground of the juxtaposition of human action that takes the form of procedure with \nother modes of human involvement. Anderson (1983) distinguished between declara-\ntive knowledge (knowledge about facts and relationships in a specific domain) and \nprocedural knowledge (how-to-make-it knowledge), a distinction presumably akin to \nRyle\u2019s (1949) widely acclaimed categories of knowing what and knowing how. \nAnderson claimed that the translation of declarative knowledge to procedural knowl-\n 17\nedge is a basic attribute of human behaviour. The transition to adulthood and the \nprocess of personal maturation involve not simply the acquisition of knowledge about \nthe world but most decisively its transformation to procedural knowledge that pro-\nvides the guidelines of how to go about in particular situations. Professional training \nrepresents one of the clearest illustration of this transformation (Dreyfus and Dreyfus, \n1986). It shows how knowledge about facts and relationships in specific domains \nmust be translated and ultimately evaluated on the efficacy of procedures for dealing \nwith domain-specific problems. The transformation of knowledge about facts and re-\nlationships to procedures is therefore a major accomplishment by means of which \nhumans become instrumental, test their knowledge of the world, understand its limits \nand its contextual embeddedness.  \n \nHowever, the conversion of knowledge about the world to procedural knowledge is \njust one out of the various paths that knowledge takes in its various transformations \n(Engestrom, 2001; Nonaka, 1994; Weick, 1979a, 1979b). In resilient cognitive sys-\ntems like those humans represent, procedural knowledge is undergoing changes that \nmay occasionally cause an understanding of the world in terms other than procedural. \nThe confrontation with the world often involves procedure modification as response \nto changing facts, or as the outcome of a procedure\u2019s inadequacy to cope with the \nsituation to which it has been regularly applied. Most significantly, the invocation of a \nprocedure presupposes the tacit definition\/reading of the situation (Goffman, 1974). \nBefore humans enact a how-to-do-it knowledge, they have to frame the situation and \ndecide what sort of behaviour it calls for, even though such a framing may be provi-\nsional in unfamiliar situations (Weick, 1979b).  \n \nFraming is a highly complex cognitive activity (Bateson, 1972; Goffman, 1974) that \nallows for the tuning or behaviour adaptation to the demands of particular situations. \nIt cannot thus be separated, at least not without serious consequences, from the web of \nsignifications underlying a particular social context. Weick\u2019s (1993) analysis of the \nMann Gulch disaster is instructive as to what may happen when framing, or sense \nmaking as he calls it, collapses or becomes dissociated from action. Coping with ur-\ngent and ambiguous situations often presupposes the ability of responding innova-\ntively to these situations. Such an ability in turn is inextricably bound up with the \ncapacity of reading\/framing such situations properly. Rigidly dissociated from \nframing, action loses its intentional component and tends to degenerate to mindless \nprocedure of execution that may have devastating consequences as the Mann Gulch \ndisaster clearly demonstrates. \u201cMen act things but move\u201d as Kenneth Burke (1966) \nused to say. \n 18\n \nBy inserting the enactment of a procedure within a certain ecology of organizational \nrelations to which such a procedure belongs, ERP systems basically dissolve the link \nbetween framing and action. In so doing, they force, wittingly or unwittingly, a \u201cbe-\nhavioural mechanics\u201d throughout the organization. Vendor evaluation, to refer to the \nsame example again, is proceduralized by providing a number of steps that have to be \nfollowed and the criteria on the basis of which each step must be completed. The pro-\ncedure obtains its meaning within the wider framework of materials management as \ncodified by the system, the work performed by peers in adjacent or related positions \n(e.g. accounting, invoice verification), the values supplied by the very criteria of ven-\ndor evaluation the system provides and so forth. There might be some leeway to ma-\nnipulate these conditions, if experience shows the system to be inadequate, overcon-\nstraining or simply irrelevant.  \n \nHowever, the lessons of experience can only be fed back into the system through the \nperiodic reconfigurations of the package and by actors other than those experiencing \nthe limitations of the package. The procedure cannot be instantly modified, despite \nevidence suggesting particular situations to require a more or less different procedural \ntreatment and other evaluation criteria. The demands of comprehensive automa-\ntion\/integration have rigidified the activities of framing and procedure enactment. \nThis contrasts with the aforementioned claims suggesting that the ability to evaluate \nprocedural modes of acting cannot be accounted by procedural knowledge itself. The \nvery judgement of how well a procedure does cannot be based on the procedure itself. \nIt requires access to significations, values (i.e. goals) and beliefs about the state of the \nworld. Knowledge about the world forms always the background against which pro-\ncedural knowledge obtains its meaning and usefulness (Bateson, 1972; Goffman, \n1974; Lackoff, 1995). \n \nThere are other concerns about the rigid separation of framing from action that may \ninhibit learning and adaptive behaviour (Engestrom, 2001; Engestrom and Midleton, \n1996). Habituation and the insights stemming from human embeddedness into the \npractical world (Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986; Introna and Whitley, 1998) contribute to \nthe withdrawal of procedural skills from immediate inspection and deliberate manipu-\nlation. This way, procedural knowledge melts into imagination and to the reservoir of \nknowledge about the world. Socialization and apprenticeship are other examples that \nNonaka (1994) suggests exemplify the opposite journey, i.e. the transformation of \nprocedural knowledge into knowledge about the world. Both involve learning through \ndemonstration, exemplification and rule or procedure following. Overall, the complex \n 19\nties between framing, acting and learning are considerably simplified by the very or-\nganizational\/behavioural premises on which ERP packages are predicated. It is there-\nfore crucial to uphold that the distinction between various forms of knowledge and the \ninvolvement they imply makes sense only in a cognitive system capable of sustaining \nthe essential bonds between these two types of knowledge (Lackoff, 1995). Rigidly \nseparated from one another, these basic human capabilities tend to degenerate to non-\nimaginative, mechanical ways of thinking and acting. The understanding of human \nagency as procedure enactment that ERP packages embody may have thus profound \nimplications for humans and organizations. \n \n \nImplications and Conclusions \nSometime ago, the renown semiotician Yuri Lotman made a distinction between \ngrammar-oriented and text-oriented cultures (see Eco, 1977). Broadly speaking, \ngrammar-oriented cultures are characterized by the elaborate specification of rules on \nthe basis of which appropriate modes of conduct are enacted as a means of coping \nwith particular situations. Under such a cultural regime, human behaviour becomes \nrelatively predictable. That is, people draw on this normative stock of knowledge to \ninvoke those rules that respond to the situations faced. By contrast, text-oriented cul-\ntures rely on socially diffused yet vaguely formulated ways of dealing with various \nsituations. Rather than being codified in terms of rules, appropriate modes of conduct \nmust be inferred\/constructed each time out of the variety of cues and materials that \nhelp make sense of particular situations. \n \nThough considerably more general, Lotman\u2019s distinction is akin to procedural versus \nless-structured forms of involvement with the world that I endeavoured to develop in \nthis article. The diffusion of ERP systems and their expanding organizational in-\nvolvement participate in the making of formal organizations to grammar oriented cul-\ntures, at the expense of other, less-structured modes of human behaviour at work. As \nnoted above, ERP systems are technologies of action that set up elaborate procedures \nby means of which an impressive variety of tasks are accomplished. Inscribed to such \nan elaborate regime of rules and procedures, human behaviour becomes less unpre-\ndictable while organizational reality emerges as transparent (i.e. adequately described \nin terms of information) and accountable (i.e. traceable in terms of who made what \nunder which conditions). In this process, organizations might come to better control \ntheir everyday operations but they may as well end up loosing other important sources \nof innovation, learning and development that confer them a distinctive identity \n(March, 1991). \n 20\n \nThe transactional mechanics which ERP packages bring about may thus block explo-\nration of alternative ways of perceiving and acting upon reality and by extension or-\nganizational development and innovation (March, 1991). The opportunity to experi-\nment, improvise and rehearse with alternative ways of perceiving and acting upon the \nworld thus presupposes forms of human involvement that are sharply distinguished \nfrom human behaviour as rule-following. Such forms of human involvement, often \nrevealed in improvisation (Ciborra, 1999; Weick, 1979a, 1993) and play (Bateson, \n1972; Kallinikos, 1996; March, 1976), collapse the distinction between general and \nprocedural knowledge, knowing what and knowing how. They ceaselessly transform \nthe one into another as a way of dealing with states of the world and learning about it. \nMost significantly, they break with the sequential pattern of procedural action and its \nlinear imposition of a temporal order (Sawyer and Southwick, 2002). In improvisation \nand play, the world is revealed in its holistic and synthetic particularity, entailing \nflashes of insight into how things are tied together (Bateson, 1972; Erikson, 1977). \nProcedural knowledge is of course implicated in these basic forms of involvement, yet \nnever as a separate realm of human agency. \n \nI cannot do justice to the variety of modes of human involvement with the world in \nthis context. But, I have sought to make clear the limitations intrinsic to the concep-\ntion and instrumentation of human agency as procedure that is embodied in ERP \npackages. The succinct treatment of organizations and human behaviour undertaken \nin the preceding sections provides an indication of the complex character of human \nagency at work, and the limitations which procedural modes of acting upon the world \nmay entail. More detailed conceptual and empirical work is however needed. We \nknow from previous studies that the codification of situated practices into disembod-\nied procedures has been a double-edged process (Engestrom and Middleton, 1996; \nKallinikos, 1999; Kling, 1996; Orlikowski et al., 1996). Yet encompassing computer-\nbased systems like those ERP packages represent accentuate some of the problems \nthat seem to be endemic to that project (Fleck, 1994; Soh et al., 2000).  \n \nSome of the claims I have made in this paper could presumably be associated with \nthose concerns Lamb and Kling (2003) have recently raised as concerns the notion of \nthe user, underlying much of the Information Systems research and practice. Lamb \nand Kling question the rationalistic underpinnings and the cognitive individualism \nimplicit in the notion of the user. They argue instead that social actors, using informa-\ntion and communication technologies, find often themselves embedded on complex \nnetworks of considerable social and technical complexity. They draw accordingly on \n 21\nseveral resources and enact multiple and shifting roles and competencies to cope with \nthe complex situations facing them. The dominant notion of the user involves an utter \nsimplification of this complex reality and needs drastic reconceptualization. In an \nanalogous fashion, the behavioural presuppositions onto which ERP systems are \npredicated recount a rather simplistic conception of human behaviour that I subsumed \nunder the label of procedure enactment. Such behavioural presuppositions certainly \nreflect the inheritance of cognitive rationalism and the dominant position it has as-\nsumed in Information Systems research and practice.  \n \nReservations toward ERP packages does not deny any positive effects they may have \non governing organizations. Technologically supported procedure development and \nstandardization that are based on best practices can break with the languid forms of \ncontextual learning, introduce and condense lessons of experience to particular or-\nganizations and contribute to the efficient management of their operations. Also, the \ncomprehensive, organization-wide character of ERP packages represents an essential \nmeans to the better coordination of organizational operations across functions and \nproduction sites. But there are significant behavioural and organizational side affects \ntoo that have by and large been overlooked. The procedural standardization brought \nabout by ERP packages delineates a distinctive form of human involvement as proce-\ndure enactment. By the same token, procedural standardization contributes to the \ntransformation of organizational practices to procedures. Standard operating proce-\ndures are ubiquitous in organizations and procedural skills and knowledge essential to \nhuman agents. However, their usefulness derives from the multiple connections they \nentertain with other forms of knowledge and modes of involvement. Technological \nembodiment of procedures by necessity loosens these connections. It cuts off proce-\ndure development from vital sources of knowledge and practice (e.g. tacit forms of \nknowledge, intuition, playful exploration and improvisation) that support and give \nmeaning to procedures and makes it increasingly difficult to accommodate other \nforms of organizing experience.  \n \nPlaced in this context, ERP systems strike a new balance in the delicate equilibrium of \nmodes of human involvement and forms of knowledge that have been accommodating \norganizations. They privilege procedural knowledge and skills (an instance of general \nand codified knowledge) over other, mostly local, forms of knowledge and modes of \ninvolvement. They put a premium on control, efficiency and standardization and in-\nevitably subordinate issues of exploration and innovation in organizations (March, \n1991). ERP technology is a technology of regulation not of innovation and must ulti-\nmately be evaluated against the background of the variety of organizational and hu-\n 22\nman trade-offs it cannot help but bring into being. Now, the growing significance of \nthe internet, and novel developments both in the designing methodologies of ERP \npackages (e.g. component based methodologies) and the forms of \ndata\/communication (multimedia) that they can accommodate may change ERP pack-\nages from transactional\/procedural machines to information infrastructures supporting \na variety of modes of human involvement. I have deliberately left these issues outside \nof consideration, focusing instead on depicting the distinctive forms by which ERP \nsystems restructure work and organizational processes. It remains to be seen what sort \nof effects these new developments may have but I predict that the transac-\ntional\/procedural legacy of ERP packages will persist in one form or another. \n \n \nReferences \nAnderson J.
