For sacrocolpopexy \n(average follow up 23 months), the risk of clinical recurrence ranged from 0% to 6%, \npersistent symptoms ranged from 3% to 31%, and mesh erosion from 0% to 12%.  For \ninfracoccygeal sacropexy (average follow up 13 months), the risk of clinical recurrence \nranged from 0% to 25%, persistent symptoms from 2% to 21%, and mesh erosion 0% to 21%. \nLimited evidence was available for sacrocolpoperineopexy and uterine suspension sling to \ndraw reliable estimates.  \nConclusion Sacrocolpopexy was associated with a low risk of recurrence but with a \nrelatively high risk of mesh erosion. Ranges of estimates for outcomes for other mesh \ntechniques were wide.  \n(Word limit set by journal: 150) \n \nKeywords efficacy, mesh, mesh erosion, NICE, pelvic organ prolapsed, safety, systematic \nreview  \n \nBrief summary  Sacrocolpopexy was associated with a low risk of recurrence but a \nhigher risk of mesh erosion. Ranges of estimates for other mesh techniques were wide.  \n(Word limit set by journal: 25) \n 3 \nIntroduction \nProlapse of the uterus or vaginal vault (middle compartment) affects a woman\u2019s health by its \nlocal physical effects (pressure, bulging, heaviness or discomfort) or its effect on urinary, \nbowel or sexual function. Current treatment options for uterine or vault prolapse include \npelvic floor muscle training,[1] use of pessaries (mechanical devices such as rings or \nshelves)[2] and surgery.[3]  \nProlapse surgery not involving mesh includes hysterectomy, cervical amputation, and \nuterine\/vault attachment with sutures to the pelvic ligaments.  Surgical techniques using mesh \ninclude sacrocolpopexy, sacrocolpoperineopexy, infracoccygeal sacropexy (also known as \nPosterior IntraVaginal Slingplasty, IVS), and uterine suspension sling.   \nIn sacrocolpopexy, the vaginal vault is attached with a mesh bridge to the periosteum \nof the sacral promontory.  If this is carried out at the same time as hysterectomy, the aim of \nthe sacrocolpopexy is prophylaxis to prevent future vault prolapse.  Sacrocolpoperineopexy is \na variation of sacrocolpopexy where extra mesh is inserted between the posterior vaginal wall \nand the rectum down to the perineum.  Use of sacrocolpoperineopexy is contentious because \nthe relatively large amount of mesh may increase risks of mesh erosion. In infracoccygeal \nsacropexy, the uterus or vault is suspended using a mesh tape with the aid of a trochar \n(tunnelling device) through each of the ischiorectal fossae.  The uterine suspension sling \ntechnique can only be used in women who wish to conserve their uterus, i.e. for uterine \nprolapse repair. In this procedure, the uterus is attached with mesh to pelvic ligaments or to \nthe periosteum of the sacral promontory.   \nBoth the efficacy and safety of mesh in surgery for uterine or vault prolapse are \nuncertain.  This report presents the estimated efficacy and safety of mesh in surgery for \nuterine or vault prolapse. It is based on a review that was commissioned through the UK \n 4 \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Interventional Procedures \nProgramme.   An electronic version of the full report is available from the NICE website.[4] \n \nMethods \nSearch strategy \nWe searched electronic databases, conference proceedings and relevant websites, contacted \n11 manufacturers, and scrutinised bibliographies of retrieved papers to identify reports of \npublished and ongoing studies on the efficacy and safety of mesh in surgery for uterine or \nvault prolapse repair.  Searches, designed to be highly sensitive and using both controlled \nvocabulary and free-text terms, were restricted to publications from 1980 onwards, to those \npublished in the English language and, for conference proceedings, to randomised controlled \ntrials published from 2005 onwards. Studies that reported only procedures without mesh were \nnot identified separately.  Full details of the search strategies used are reproduced in the \noriginal report[4] or are available from the authors.   \nThe databases searched were: Medline (1980 \u2013 Nov Wk 2 2007), Medline In-Process \n(4th Jan 2008), EMBASE (1980 \u2013 2008 Wk 1), Biosis (1985 \u2013 3rd Jan 2008), Science Citation \nIndex (1980 \u2013 5th Jan 2008), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, \nIssue 4 2007), and ISI Conference Proceedings (1990 \u2013 11th Feb 2008) as well as current \nresearch registers (National Research Register (Issue 2, 2007), Current Controlled Trials (Jan \n2008) and Clinical Trials (Jan 2008).  Additional databases searched for systematic reviews \nand other background information included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \n(The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2007), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness \n(Jan 2008) and the HTA Database (Jan 2008). Conference proceedings of major \nurogynaecological organisations (American Urogynecologic Society (2005-6), American \nUrological Association (2005-7), European Association of Urology (2005-7), European \n 5 \nSociety of Gynecological Endoscopy (2005-6), International Continence Society (2005-7)  \nand International Urogynecological Association (2005-7) were scrutinised. \n \nInclusion and exclusion criteria \nOne reviewer screened titles\/abstracts.  Any uncertainties were discussed with a second \nreviewer and consensus was reached.  Full text copies of all reports deemed to be potentially \nrelevant were obtained and assessed by the main reviewer for inclusion. \n Full-text RCTs, RCTs published as conference abstracts from 2005 onwards, non-\nrandomised comparative studies, and case series using mesh were sought.  As the volume of \nliterature for sacrocolpopexy was substantial, only case series with a sample size of at least \n100 women were included.  There was no sample size restriction placed on case series that \nreported other mesh techniques because the volume of literature for these techniques was \nvery limited.   \nCase series with a mean follow up of at least one year were included for both efficacy \nand safety.  Case series with a mean follow up of less than one year were included for safety \noutcomes only.  We considered one year to be a minimum adequate period of time in which to \nassess the efficacy of prolapse repair.   \nThe participants were women undergoing uterine or vault prolapse surgery.  Studies \nof women with cancer or with prolapse caused by congenital anomalies, inherited conditions, \nor creation of a neovagina were excluded.  Studies with women undergoing other \nconcomitant operations, such as anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse repair or anti-\nincontinence procedures were included providing the main indication for surgery was uterine \nor vault prolapse.   \nWe considered all surgical techniques for uterine or vault prolapse repair which \ninvolved the use of mesh.  There were no restrictions on the type of mesh used.  For RCTs \n 6 \nand non-randomised comparative studies, the comparators were any other surgical techniques \nwith or without mesh.   \nThe primary outcomes for efficacy were patient-reported persistent prolapse \nsymptoms and clinician-reported recurrence of prolapse at the original site measured with a \nvalidated quantitative tool, e.g. the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (POP-Q) system or \nBaden-Walker system.  Secondary outcomes for efficacy included:  new (de novo) prolapse \nat other sites that were free of prolapse before surgery; the need for repeat surgery for \nprolapse (both recurrent at the same site and de novo); persistent urinary symptoms; \npersistent bowel symptoms; and persistent sexual symptoms. For urinary, bowel, and sexual \nsymptoms, only women who reported these symptoms at baseline were counted.  If possible, \nonly women who were sexually active were considered for sexual function outcomes.   \nThe primary outcome for safety was mesh erosion. Secondary outcomes included: \nblood loss; damage to surrounding organs during the operation; an operation for mesh erosion \nor removal; new urinary, bowel or sexual symptoms; and infection. For new urinary, bowel \nor sexual symptoms, only women who were free of these symptoms at baseline were \nconsidered for these outcomes.   \nWe also considered other serious and minor adverse effects not otherwise specified, \noperation time, and hospital stay.  Details on these outcomes are provided in the full report.[4]  \n \nData extraction and quality assessment \nData extraction and methodological quality assessment of the RCTs were conducted by two \nreviewers (XJ, CG) independently. The main reviewer (XJ) extracted data and assessed the \nquality of the remaining studies (due to resource constraints imposed by the review timelines).  \nTwo separate quality assessment checklists were used according to study design.  Both \nchecklists were developed by the Review Body for Interventional Procedures (ReBIP; Health \n 7 \nServices Research Units at the Universities of Aberdeen and Sheffield), an independent \nreview body that carries out systematic reviews for NICE\u2019s Interventional Procedures \nProgramme. The checklists were adapted from several sources.[5-7] \n \nData analysis \nFour techniques that use mesh were identified: sacrocolpopexy, sacrocolpoperineopexy, \ninfracoccygeal sacropexy, and uterine suspension sling. Data analyses were conducted \nseparately for each of the technique, and for each technique, data were presented separately \nfor three subgroups of women according to the type of prolapse being repaired:  uterine \nprolapse; vault prolapse; and uterine and\/or vault prolapse (where the data were not reported \nseparately).   \nMeta-analyses were conducted of full-text RCTs, RCTs available as conference \nabstracts, and non-randomised comparative studies (using Cochrane Collaboration Review \nManager, RevMan 4.3 software).  These allowed the efficacy and safety of procedures using \nmesh versus procedures without mesh, and between different techniques that used mesh, to be \ncompared directly.  All tests of significance were performed at the 5% level.  For each \noutcome, the median and the range of the event rates were calculated by study design (RCTs, \nnon-randomised comparative studies, case series\/registries).  This required each arm of an \nRCT or comparative study to be considered as a separate case series.   \n Pre-specified subgroup analyses were planned for different surgical approaches \n(vaginal; open abdominal; and laparoscopic), different mesh types (non-absorbable synthetic \nmesh; absorbable synthetic mesh; biological absorbable graft; and combined mesh containing \nboth absorbable and non-absorbable material) and for women having primary versus \nsecondary repairs.   \n \n 8 \nResults \nNumber and type and quality of included studies \nFrom the initial 853 publications identified by the search strategy, 54 studies (reported in 60 \npublications) were included, of which 5 were full-text RCTs,[8-12] 3 were RCTs available as \nconference abstracts,[13-15] 17 were non-randomised comparative studies,[16-32] and 29 \nwere case series.[33-61] Seven manufacturers provided relevant studies, all of which had \nalready been identified by our searches. The screening process is summarised in Figure 1.  \nAppendix 1 to 4 show details of study design, methods, participants, and interventions for \nsacrocolpopexy, sacrocolpoperineopexy, infracoccygeal sacropexy, and uterine suspension \nsling. Two studies involving 238 women reported a mixture of above techniques but did not \nreport them separately.[20,40] Details and results of these two studies are available in the full \nreport.[4] Seven ongoing RCTs[62-67] (personal communication: A Griffiths, Johnson & \nJohnson, 2007), one ongoing registry,[68] and one ongoing case series[66]  were also \nidentified.   \nThe included studies took place during the period 1991 \u2013 2007 in 16 countries.  \nOverall, 7054 women were treated in total, of whom 4456 were treated with sacrocolpopexy, \n282 with sacrocolpoperineopexy, 976 with infracoccygeal sacropexy, 159 with uterine \nsuspension sling, 238 a mixture of the above mesh techniques, and 943 with no-mesh \ntechniques.   \nAcross studies, the average age of the women was 61 years.  Women who were treated \nwith uterine suspension sling (a technique allows uterus to be preserved for future pregnancy) \nwere younger (average age 37 years) than those treated with other techniques (average age \naround 65 years).  Only six studies provided information on whether the procedures were \nprimary or secondary, of which two presented data on primary surgery alone.   \n 9 \nWe assessed the methodological quality of the full-text studies only because the \nabstracts only provided limited information about quality.  The study quality of RCTs, non-\nrandomised comparative studies, and case series is summarised in Figure  S1, S2 and S3 \nrespectively (supplementary data). \n \nSacrocolpopexy \nThirty-two studies (4 full-text RCTs,[8-11] 1 RCT available as conference abstract,[13] 15 \nnon-randomised comparative studies,[16-19,21-26,28-32] and 12 case series with sample \nsizes over 100) involving a total of 4456 women provided data on sacrocolpopexy.  Two \nstudies[13,19] reported on uterine prolapse (hysterectomy followed by sacrocolpopexy in the \nsame procedure), seven studies reported vault prolapse (sacrocolpopexy \nalone),[9,11,21,26,29,42,47] two studies reported uterine and vault prolapse separately,[23,61] \nand 21 studies[8,10,16-18,22,24,25,28,30-32,35-39,46,51,57,59] reported data from women \nhaving uterine and\/or vault prolapse together (Appendix 1).  Mesh types varied across studies.  \nThe median (range) of mean follow up across these 32 studies was 23 months (8 to 66 \nmonths).  Table 1 shows, for each type of study, the medians and ranges of event rates across \nstudies for primary outcomes for sacrocolpopexy. \n \nEfficacy \nOne small RCT involving 89 women with vault prolapse compared sacrocolpopexy (mesh) \nwith sacrospinous colpopexy (no mesh): differences in risk of persistent symptom (RR 0.70, \n95% CI 0.17 to 2.95) and risk of prolapse recurrence (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.04) were \nnot statistically significant.[11]   \nThe risks of recurrence across all study designs ranged from 0% to 6% in 14 studies \ninvolving 1054 women (median 1.2%, Table 1), while the risks for persistent prolapse \n 10 \nsymptoms ranged from 3% to 31% in 9 studies involving 638 women (median 22%).  In 4 \nstudies involving 451 women, risks of needing a further operation for recurrent or de novo \nprolapse ranged from 0% to 14% (median 8%).  Estimates for other outcomes were based on \nsingle studies only.   \n \nSafety \nThe risk of mesh erosion ranged from 0% to 12% (median 5.4%, 27 studies, n=2922, Table \n1). Zero to 11% of women required an operation for mesh erosion (median 3.8%, 17 studies, \nn=2074).  In studies reporting mesh erosion, most studies used non-absorbable synthetic \nmesh (Table 2). The median mesh erosion rates across studies were 4.0% (range 0% to 12.0%, \n21 studies, n=1869) for non-absorbable synthetic mesh compared with 0% (range 0% to 0.8%, \n5 studies, n=229) for absorbable biological graft. No studies reported mesh erosion data for \nabsorbable synthetic mesh and only one study reported mesh erosion for combined mesh \n(4.3%, 1\/23). \nFor other safety outcomes, the proportion of women who required a blood transfusion \nfor sacrocolpopexy ranged from 0% to 17% (median 1.7%, 19 studies, n=2080).  The range \nfor women suffering organ damage varied from 0% to 8% (median 2.1%, 15 studies, n=1723).  \nNew urinary symptoms in women who did not have these symptoms at baseline occurred in \n4% to 9% (median 6.8%, 4 studies, n=294).  The estimate for new bowel symptoms (1%, \n2\/178) was based on a single study, and the estimate for new sexual symptoms (range 9% to \n15%, n=87) was based on two small studies.  The range for infection was wide, which \nreflected the variety of ways used to define it (0.8% to 68%, 17 studies, n=1391).   \nData were available for meta-analysis comparing blood transfusion, damage to \nsurrounding organs, infection and new urinary symptoms between sacrocolpopexy (mesh) \n 11 \nand sacrospinous colpopexy (no mesh).  There was not enough evidence to demonstrate a \ndifference in any of these outcomes between the operations.[4]   \n \nSacrocolpoperineopexy \nTwo studies involving 442 women reported on sacrocolpoperineopexy.[31,58] (Appendix 2). \nTable 3 shows the event rates for primary outcomes for sacrocolpoperineopexy. Neither of the \ntwo studies gave details of uterine and vault prolapse separately. Risks of mesh erosion \nreported by these two studies were similar (8.5% in 118 women in 6 months and 8.3% in 169 \nwomen in 14 months). \n \nInfracoccygeal sacropexy (posterior IVS) \nFourteen studies (2 RCTs available as conference abstracts,[14,15] 1 non-randomised \ncomparative study,[27] 2 case series with sample sizes \u2265100, [45,60] and 9 case series with \nsample sizes <100[41,43,44,48,52-56]) involving 976 women provided data on \ninfracoccygeal sacropexy. One study[27] reported uterine repair (uterus conserved), \n5[14,41,43,44,53] reported vault repair, onereported uterine and vault repairs separately[56], \nand 7[15,45,48,52,54,55,60] studies reported uterine and vault repairs together (Appendix 3).  \nThe median follow up across these 14 studies was 13 months (range 5 to 30 months).  The \nranges of event rates for primary outcomes are shown in Table 4.  Meta-analysis was not \npossible because the comparative studies used different comparators.   \n \nEfficacy \nThe proportion of women with persistent prolapse symptoms ranged from 2% to 21% \n(median 8.8%, n=262, 3 studies) after infracoccygeal sacropexy, whereas the range for \nprolapsed recurrence was 0% to 25% (median 4.8%, 9 studies, n=402).  In 3 studies (n=288), \n 12 \nthe re-operation rate varied from none to 30% (median 7.9%).  Estimates for other outcomes \nwere based on single studies with few women.   \n \nSafety \nThe risks of mesh erosion ranged from 0% to 21% (median 6.7%, 11 studies, n=889), and \n0.3% to 17% of women needed an operation for mesh erosion (median 7.2%, 6 studies, \nn=678).  All studies reporting mesh erosion used non-absorbable synthetic mesh. The need \nfor blood transfusion ranged from 0% to 2% (7 studies, n=383).  The risks of organ damage \nranged from 0% to 2.7% (median 0%, 9 studies, n=684).  Little evidence was available for \nnew urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, and sexual symptoms in women who did not have \nthese symptoms at baseline.  Infection ranged from 0% to 9% (8 studies, n=698).   \n \nUterine suspension sling \nSix studies[12,19,33,34,49,50] involving 239 women reported on uterine suspension sling \noperations.  One was a full-text RCT,[12] one was a non-randomised comparative study,[19] \nand four were case series[33,34,49,50] (Appendix 4).  All of the case series had a sample size \nof less than 100.  Five of the six studies reported sacrohysteropexy (uterus suspended to the \nsacrum with a mesh bridge) and the other[49] reported a different technique (suspending the \nuterus to the pectineal ligaments).  The median follow up across the six studies was 33 \nmonths (12 to 95 months).  Meta-analysis was not possible because the comparative studies \nused different comparators.   \n \nEfficacy, safety, operation time and hospital stay  \nTable 5 shows the event rates for primary outcomes.  The range of persistent prolapse \nsymptoms was wide (0% to 39%, median 3.3%, 3 studies, n=91).  The risks of recurrence \n 13 \nranged from 0% to 8% (median 3.3%, 5 studies, n=136), while the risks of requiring a re-\noperation for prolapse ranged from 0% to 22% (median 3.3%, 3 studies, n=107).  Little \nevidence was available for estimating other efficacy outcomes or any of the safety outcomes.   \n \nDiscussion \nSummary of the evidence \nThe review indicated that although sacrocolpopexy is associated with an apparent risk of \nclinical recurrence ranging from 0% to 6% (at an average follow up of two years), the \nincidence of persistent prolapse symptoms (range 3% to 31%) and need for a further prolapse \noperation (range 2% to 25%) were relatively high.  There were risks from adverse effects \nsuch as mesh erosion (range 0% to 12%), which often required a further operation for mesh \nerosion (range 1% to 11%).  Non-absorbable mesh was associated with a higher risk of mesh \nerosion (median 4.0%, range 0% to 12.0%) compared with absorbable biological graft \n(median 0%, range 0% to 0.8%).  \nSacrocolpoperineopexy was associated with 8% of mesh erosion at an average follow \nup of one year. Little evidence was available for other outcomes.    \nFor infracoccygeal sacropexy, persistent symptoms ranged from 2% to 21% at an \naverage follow up of one year, clinical recurrence varied from 0% to 25%, mesh erosion from \n0% to 21%, and operation for mesh erosion from 2% to 17%.   \nFor uterine suspension sling, the clinical recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 8% at an \naverage follow up of three years, whereas persistent symptoms ranged from 0% to 39%. \nHowever, little evidence was available for safety outcomes.   \n \nAssumptions, limitations, and uncertainties \n 14 \nWe aimed to review separately data from women having uterine prolapse and vault prolapse, \nbecause the operations, and hence the efficacy and safety, might be different in these two \npopulations.  However, the majority of the studies (32\/54) reported data from women having \nuterine or vault repairs without separating the groups.  As there was limited evidence for \nuterine prolapse repair and for vault prolapse repair alone, we did review evidence from \nstudies that reported a mixture of uterine and vault prolapse.   \n  We did not separate data by surgical approach. We are aware that the laparoscopic \napproach is gaining in popularity. This could be applied in sacrocolpopexy, \nsacrocolpoperineopexy, or uterine suspension sling. A small proportion of the included \nstudies reported that the operations were done laparoscopically and were all for \nsacrocolpopexy (7.5%, 336\/4456).[25,26,29,32,46] \nIt is important to determine whether safety and efficacy of mesh differ in women \nhaving primary versus recurrent prolapse repairs.  However, of the 54 included studies, only \ntwo case series[35,61] reported exclusively on women having primary repairs.  Another four \nstudies[18,34,49,51] reported the case mix of primary and secondary operations but did not \nreport outcome data separately for the two groups.  It is likely that the remaining 48 studies \nincluded women having both primary and secondary surgery but this was not reported.   \nThere was a very limited number of RCTs available (20%, 11\/54) of which five were \navailable only as conference abstracts. The number of RCTs in each subgroup (by two types \nof prolapse, and by four different surgical techniques) was even smaller (Appendices 1 to 4). \nData were therefore too few to compare efficacy and safety between surgical techniques \nusing mesh (each type) and no mesh and between different mesh techniques.   \nWe pragmatically considered one year as an adequate minimum period of time to \nassess the efficacy of middle compartment prolapse repair.  However, as the mean time to \nreoperation is 12 years[69] one year may be too short to judge success.  Therefore failure rates \n 15 \nat one year may not be representative of longer-term efficacy.  Prospective studies will require \nextended follow up to assess meaningful mesh failure rates.   \nNevertheless, the results were considered generalisable as the majority of studies \nrecruited participants from a spectrum of routine practice, without restrictions for the severity \nof prolapse or other patient characteristics.   \n \nConclusions and implications \nIn general, sacrocolpopexy was associated with a low risk of recurrence, but the risks of \npersistent prolapse symptoms, re-operation, and mesh erosion were relatively high.  The \nestimates for the efficacy and safety outcomes for infracoccygeal sacropexy were wide.  \nThere was only limited evidence for efficacy and safety for sacrocolpoperineopexy or uterine \nsuspension sling.   \nIn consequence, in January 2009, NICE (UK) recommended that, for all but \nsacrocolpopexy for vaginal vault prolapse repair,[70] \u2018special arrangements for clinical \ngovernance, consent and audit or research\u2019 should be used.[71-74]  The implications are that \nthe \u2018clinical governance leads in their Trusts should be informed, and patients need to be \nexplicitly counselled about the uncertainty regarding safety and efficacy.  Clear written \ninformation must be provided\u2019.  NICE also recommend that clinicians should enter details \nabout all patients undergoing the procedures on the British Society for Urogynaecology \nDatabase so that a UK-wide audit of current practice can be carried out.   \nIn addition, rigorous RCTs, with adequate power to detect clinically meaningful \ndifferences and long-term outcomes, are needed to determine the comparative efficacy of \nmesh techniques and their optimal place in the treatment of middle compartment prolapse.  \nThey should use validated patient-reported outcome measures, primarily to compare the \n 16 \nfailure rates and safety profiles, between mesh and no-mesh techniques, between different \ntypes of mesh techniques, and between different types of mesh.   \n \n(Word count: 3503). \n \n 17 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank Adrian Grant (Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen) for \ncommenting on the study design; Georgios Lyratzopoulos and Sally Wortley (Interventional \nProcedures Programme, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), UK) \nfor commenting on the draft.
