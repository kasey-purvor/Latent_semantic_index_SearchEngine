In contrast to GaAs-\nbased systems, relatively little attention has been paid to\nInAs, even although it may be important in future spintronics\napplications. We previously measured spin lifetimes in\nnarrow-gap semiconductors ~NGSs!, Hg12xCdxTe and InSb,\nat wavelengths between 4 and 10 mm over the temperature\nrange of 4 to 300 K.4 We have now extended those measure-\nments to include bulk epilayers of InAs as a function of\ndoping at 300 K.\nThe InAs samples were grown at Imperial College by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy on GaAs ~001! substrates5 with the\nfollowing 300 K Hall effect characteristics.

The pump and probe beams are pulsed, and by\nchanging the time delay between the pump and probe, and\ncomparing the SCP and OCP results, we measure the spin\ndecay lifetime. The optical pulses for the experiment, carried\nout at the University of Surrey, were generated with a solid-\nstate laser system that produces ;40 fs pulses from 2.5 to 11\nmm wavelength, with a repetition rate of 250 kHz and typical\naverage power of 5 mW. The beams were focused onto the\nsample with spot sizes of approximately 100 mm, and the\ntransmitted probe light was detected with a liquid-nitrogen-\ncooled InSb photodiode.\nResults for the transmission change in the probe due to\nthe pump are shown for sample IC313 in Fig. 1 for SCP and\nOCP configurations at a wavelength of 3.4 mm; that is, just\nabove the absorption edge. The data are in extremely good\nagreement with the results of other workers.6 Following Ref.\n6, we plot the fractional difference in transmission between\nSCP and OCP, Popt5(DTSCP2DTOCP)\/(DTSCP1DTOCP)\nshown in the inset, and interpret the monoexponential decay\ntime of 20 ps as the spin lifetime ts . The error in the fitting\ndue to noise in the data is estimated to be 610 ps. In prac-\ntice, our polarizers were not fully optimized for these long\nwavelengths, so that the maximum polarization we achieve is\nsomewhat less than the maximum value attainable.\nIn order to test the effect of n-type doping, the measure-0 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n5221Appl.

For this sample, the\nabsorption edge is Moss\u2013Burstein shifted to higher energy\nby the degenerate doping, and the wavelength used was 3.2\nmm. Although the change in polarization Popt from SCP to\nOCP is quite large, the decay times of each are similar to\neach other in this case and also to the Auger recombination\nrate. However, there is still an obvious difference in the de-\ncays of SCP and OCP, as evidenced by the fact that Popt is\nnot flat, and this can still be used to measure a spin lifetime.\nClearly the decay of the spin polarization is substantially\nlengthened, and the decay time of Popt , plotted in the inset,\nnow gives a spin lifetime of ts51.660.5 ns. A similar and\nhitherto unexplained lengthening of spin lifetime, was ob-\ntained for InSb in our earlier work:4 ME1654 (ts516 ps)\nand ME1629 (ts5300 ps) for the undoped and degenerate\nn-type samples, respectively. We note that the room-\ntemperature mobilities are very similar for all these samples,\nso that we have to look elsewhere to explain these large\nchanges in spin lifetime.\nIn bulk semiconductors, three main spin relaxation pro-\ncesses have been found to be important in optical orientation\nexperiments: the Elliott\u2013Yafet ~EY!,8 D\u2019yakonov\u2013Perel,\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject t~DP!9 and the Bir\u2013Aronov\u2013Pikus ~BAP!10 mechanisms. The\nBAP mechanism is thought to be particularly important in\np-type wide-gap materials and is based on the electron\u2013hole\nexchange interaction. By contrast with the other two pro-\ncesses, it depends directly on the concentration of holes, and\nis not thought to be important in n-type NGS.\nThe EY mechanism results from the fact that in real\ncrystals Bloch states are not spin eigenstates because of the\nstrong spin\u2013orbit coupling induced by the lattice ions, so that\nthe spin relaxation is directly related to the orbital relaxation\nprocesses. This mechanism has been shown to be important\nat low temperatures in NGS.11\u201313 The EY spin relaxation rate\nfor ionized impurity scattering and degenerate statistics is\n1\nts\n\u2019\n32\n27 S gEFEG D\n2S 12g\/212g\/3D\n2 1\ntp\n, ~1!\nwhere g5D\/(EG1D), and D is the spin\u2013orbit splitting of\nthe valence band.

The relationship of Eq.\n~4! has recently been confirmed quantitatively for degenerate\nn-GaAs at helium temperature.14 Following others, we ne-\nglect the extremely rapid decay of the hole spin polarization\nin interpreting our experiments.3,4,6\nIn our previous work,4 we demonstrated that the tem-\nperature dependence of the results for n-type Hg0.78Cd0.22Te\ncould be explained in terms of the EY model. We also\nshowed a remarkable lengthening of the spin lifetime in InSb\nfrom ;16 ps for intrinsic material to 300 ps for the degen-\nerate case. The reason for the lengthening was not explained,\nbut we showed that the longer spin lifetime of the degenerate\ncase was consistent with the EY process dominating, as with\nthe n-HgCdTe.\nFor intrinsic and lightly doped samples, the DP process\n@Eq. ~3!# dominates for both InAs and InSb @theoretical\/\nexperimental values for tDP are obtained as follows: IC313o AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n5222 Appl.

The EY process\n@Eq. ~2!# gives tEY;50 ps and tEY;350 ps, respectively, so\nthat clearly it is not important for this case.\nIn the presence of significant n-doping, two points be-\ncome extremely important with regard to the DP process. In\nthe first instance, it is obvious from the prefactor in Eq. ~4!\nthat the onset of degeneracy considerably suppresses the DP\nprocess in the case of n-InSb and n-InAs, in which the mo-\nbilities ~and hence tp) are relatively constant for the range of\nsamples measured. Thus, for the more heavily doped samples\nin this limit we obtain theoretical values from Eqs. ~1! and\n~4! as follows: IC311 (tEY;500 ps,tDP;800 ps) and\nME1629 (tEY;100 ps,tDP;100 ps). However, in addition\nto this it has been demonstrated recently15 that for the DP\nprocess, the precession of an electron spin can be as effec-\ntively randomized by scattering from another electron ~i.e.,\nelectron\u2013electron scattering!15,16 via the Coulomb interaction\nas by scattering from thermal vibrations or defects, and yet\nthis process can affect the mobility only weakly. This would\naccentuate the difference between the two processes ~i.e.,\nlengthen tDP and shorten tEY). Thus, for both these reasons,\nwe expect the spin relaxation for samples IC311 and\nME1629 to be dominated by the EY process, and in fact this\nis in reasonable agreement with our measured values of ts\ngiven the simplifications of the model @Eq. ~1!# @experiment\/\ntheory(tEY): IC311, 1.6 ns\/500 ps; ME1619, 300 ps\/100 ps#.\nIn summary, our results for intrinsic n-InAs ~and earlier,\nn-InSb) are in excellent agreement with the predictions of\nthe DP process. However, we have measured a remarkably\nlong spin lifetime ~;1.6 ns! in near-degenerate n-InAs at\n300 K. This, together with our earlier result for degenerate\nn-InSb ~t;300 ps!,4 is explained in terms of the suppression\nof the DP spin relaxation process by the degeneracy condi-\ntion and by electron\u2013electron scattering. ~We note that a\nsimilar effect was reported very recently in degenerate\nn-type Si.17!
