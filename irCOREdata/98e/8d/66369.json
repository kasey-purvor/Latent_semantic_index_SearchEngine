Lepton flavor violating decays \u00b5\u2192 e+\u03b3,\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 e+\u03b3 are considered and a characteristic relation between their de-\ncay rates is predicted. The effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay\ndepends on the CP violating phase controlling the leptogenesis if one of the heavy Ma-\njorana neutrinos is much heavier than the other two. Successful leptogenesis requires\na rather mild mass hierarchy between the latter. The indicated hierarchical relations\nare also compatible with the low-energy neutrino mixing phenomenology. The scenario\nunder study is compatible with the low\u2013energy neutrino mixing phenomenology. The\nCP violation effects in neutrino oscillations can be observable. In general, there is no\ndirect connection between the latter and the CP violation in leptogenesis. If the CP\nviolating phases of the see\u2013saw model satisfy certain relations, the baryon asymmetry\nof the Universe and the rephasing invariant JCP which determines the magnitude of\nthe CP violation effects in neutrino oscillations, depend on the same CP violating\nphase and their signs are correlated.\n\u2217Also at: Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1784 Sofia,\nBulgaria\n1 Introduction\nExplaining both the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (YB) and the smallness\nof the neutrino masses, can be done successfully by combining the see\u2013saw [1] and the lep-\ntogenesis [2] mechanisms. The first predicts the neutrinos to be Majorana particles and\nintroduces additional right\u2013handed heavy Majorana neutrinos, whose out\u2013of\u2013equilibrium\ndecay in the early Universe generates YB via the second. The mounting evidence in favor of\nneutrino oscillations (see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6]) gave analyzes of these two mechanisms a firmer\nphenomenological basis. Establishing a connection between the low energy (neutrino mix-\ning) and high energy (leptogenesis) parameters has gathered much attention in recent years\n[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. However, the number of parameters of the see\u2013saw mechanism\nis significantly larger than the number of quantities measurable in the \u201clow energy\u201d neutrino\nexperiments. It is the neutrino Dirac mass matrix mD that contains most of the unknown\nparameters and on whose knowledge any statement about a possible connection of low and\nhigh energy phenomena relies. While, in general, it is impossible to establish a direct link\nbetween the phenomena related to neutrino mixing and to leptogenesis, most specific models\nusually allow very well for such a connection.\nIn the present article we investigate the possible link between the leptogenesis, taking\nplace at \u201chigh energy\u201d, and the \u201clow energy\u201d phenomena associated with the existence of\nneutrino mixing. Our analysis is based on the assumption of a hierarchical structure of the\nheavy Majorana neutrino masses and of the Dirac mass matrixmD, both of which are part of\nthe see\u2013saw mechanism. As specific examples of low energy phenomena related to neutrino\nmixing we consider the lepton flavour violating (LFV) charged lepton decays, \u00b5 \u2192 e + \u03b3,\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 e+\u03b3, the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta ((\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013)\ndecay, |\u3008m\u3009|, and the CP violating asymmetry in neutrino oscillations. We analyze, in par-\nticular, the effects of the high energy CP violating phases, which control the generation of\nthe baryon asymmetry in the leptogenesis scenario, in |\u3008m\u3009| and in the leptonic CP violation\nrephasing invariant JCP [16] which determines the magnitude of the CP violation in neutrino\noscillations 1.\nIn the next Section we briefly review the formalisms associated with the see\u2013saw mecha-\nnism and with the leptogenesis scenario, and that of LFV charged lepton decays. Different\nparameterizations of mD used in the literature and the corresponding connection they imply\nbetween the high and low energy physical parameters are discussed in Section 3. In Section\n4 we formulate the assumptions of a hierarchical structure of the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmasses and of the Dirac mass matrix mD on which our investigation is based, and analyze\nthe leptogenesis in the so\u2013called \u201cbi\u2013unitary\u201d parametrization of mD. Predictions for the\nbranching rations of the LFV charged lepton decays are also given. In Section 5 the effects of\nthe high energy leptogenesis CP violating phases on |\u3008m\u3009| and on the leptonic CP violation\nrephasing invariant JCP . Finally, we conclude in Section 6.\n1For similar earlier attempts (not taking into account the questions of CP violation and LFV decays),\nsee, e.g., [17, 18].\n2\n2 Framework\nThe neutrino oscillation data can consistently be described within a 3\u2013neutrino mixing\nscheme with massive Majorana neutrinos, in which the light neutrino Majorana mass matrix\nm\u03bd is given by:\nm\u03bd = UPMNS m\ndiag\n\u03bd U\nT\nPMNS . (1)\nHere mdiag\u03bd is a diagonal matrix containing the masses m1,2,3 of the three massive Majorana\nneutrinos and UPMNS is the unitary Pontecorvo\u2013Maki\u2013Nagakawa\u2013Sakata [19] lepton mixing\nmatrix, which can be parametrized as\nUPMNS = V diag(1, e\ni\u03b1, ei(\u03b2+\u03b4))\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\nc1c3 s1c3 s3e\n\u2212i\u03b4\n\u2212s1c2 \u2212 c1s2s3ei\u03b4 c1c2 \u2212 s1s2s3ei\u03b4 s2c3\ns1s2 \u2212 c1c2s3ei\u03b4 \u2212c1s2 \u2212 s1c2s3ei\u03b4 c2c3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 diag(1, ei\u03b1, ei(\u03b2+\u03b4)) , (2)\nwhere \u03b4 is a Dirac CP violating phase, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are Majorana CP violating phases [20, 21],\nci = cos \u03b8i and si = sin \u03b8i. The angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 control the oscillations of solar and at-\nmospheric neutrinos, respectively. The angle \u03b83 is limited by the CHOOZ and Palo Verde\nreactor \u03bd\u00afe experiments: one has sin\n2 \u03b83 < 0.05 [22, 5]. The Dirac phase \u03b4 can be mea-\nsured, in principle, in long base\u2013line neutrino oscillation experiments (see, e.g., [23, 24]).\nThe flavour neutrino oscillations are insensitive to the Majorana phases \u03b1 and \u03b2 [20, 25].\nInformation about these phases can be obtained by studying processes in which the total\nlepton charge L is not conserved and changes by two units [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]: (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay,\nK+ \u2192 \u03c0\u2212 + \u00b5+ + \u00b5+, etc.\nIntroducing a Dirac neutrino mass term and a Majorana mass term for the right\u2013handed\nneutrinos via the Lagrangian\n\u2212L = \u03bdLi (mD)ij NRj + 1\n2\n(NRi)c (MR)ij NRj , (3)\nleads for sufficiently large MR to the well know see\u2013saw [1] formula\nm\u03bd \u2243 \u2212mDM\u22121R mTD , (4)\nwhere terms of order O(M\u22122R ) are neglected. In order to explain the smallness of neutrino\nmasses, the see\u2013saw mechanism requires the existence of heavy right\u2013handed Majorana neu-\ntrinos. The latter can create a lepton asymmetry via their CP violating out\u2013of\u2013equilibrium\ndecays induced by the see\u2013saw related Yukawa couplings. At later epoch the lepton asym-\nmetry is converted into the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through sphaleron mediated\nprocesses [2]. Thus, leptogenesis is naturally incorporated in the see\u2013saw model, which makes\nthe model particularly attractive.\n2.1 Leptogenesis\nLeptogenesis fulfills all of Sakharov\u2019s three conditions [31] for generation of a non\u2013vanishing\nbaryon asymmetry YB. The requisite CP violating asymmetry is caused by the interference\n3\nof the tree level contribution and the one\u2013loop corrections in the decay rate of the lightest\nof the three heavy Majorana neutrinos, N1 \u2192 \u03a6\u2212 \u2113+ and N1 \u2192 \u03a6+ \u2113\u2212:\n\u03b51 =\n\u0393(N1 \u2192 \u03a6\u2212 \u2113+)\u2212 \u0393(N1 \u2192 \u03a6+ \u2113\u2212)\n\u0393(N1 \u2192 \u03a6\u2212 \u2113+) + \u0393(N1 \u2192 \u03a6+ \u2113\u2212)\n\u2243 1\n8 \u03c0 v2\n1\n(m\u2020DmD)11\n\u2211\nj=2,3\nIm(m\u2020DmD)\n2\n1j\n(\nf(M2j \/M\n2\n1 ) + g(M\n2\nj \/M\n2\n1 )\n)\n.\n(5)\nHere v \u2243 174 GeV is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. The function f stems from\nvertex [2, 32] and g from self\u2013energy [33] contributions:\nf(x) =\n\u221a\nx\n(\n1\u2212 (1 + x) ln\n(\n1 + x\nx\n))\n, g(x) =\n\u221a\nx\n1\u2212 x . (6)\nFor x \u226b 1, i.e., for hierarchical heavy Majorana neutrinos, one has f(x) + g(x) \u2243 \u2212 3\n2\n\u221a\nx\n.\nThe baryon asymmetry is obtained via\nYB = a\n\u03ba\ng\u2217\n\u03b51 , (7)\nwhere a \u2243 \u22121\/2 is the fraction of the lepton asymmetry converted into a baryon asymmetry\n[34], g\u2217 \u2243 100 is the number of massless degrees of freedom at the time of the decay, and \u03ba\nis a dilution factor that is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations. Typically, one gets\nYB \u223c 10\u221210 when \u03b51 \u223c (10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127) and \u03ba \u223c (10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122). We note that this estimate of\nYB is valid in the supersymmetric (SUSY) theories as well since in the latter both g\n\u2217 and \u03b51\nare larger approximately by the same factor of 2.\n2.2 LFV Charged Lepton Decays\nIn extensions of the Standard Theory including massive neutrinos, lepton flavour non\u2013\nconserving (LFV) processes such as \u00b5 \u2192 e + \u03b3, \u00b5 \u2192 3e, \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03b3, \u03c4 \u2192 e + \u03b3, etc.\nare predicted to take place (see, e.g., [35]). However, in the non\u2013SUSY versions of the see\u2013\nsaw model, the decay rates and cross sections of the LFV processes are strongly suppressed\nand are practically unobservable [36, 37]. The most stringent experimental limit on the\n\u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3 decay branching ratio reads [38]\nBR(\u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3) < 1.2\u00d7 10\u221211 . (8)\nThere are prospects to improve this limit by \u223c 3 orders of magnitude in the future (see,\ne.g., [39]). The existing bounds on the LFV decays of the \u03c4\u2212lepton are considerably less\nstringent: one has, e.g., BR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+ \u03b3) < 6.0\u00d7 10\u22127 [40]. There are possibilities to reach a\nsensitivity to values of BR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+ \u03b3) \u223c (10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22129) at B\u2013factory and LHC experiments\n[41].\nIn SUSY theories incorporating the see\u2013saw mechanism, new sources of lepton flavour\nviolation arise. In SUSY GUT theories these are typically related to the soft SUSY\u2013breaking\nterms of the Lagrangian. Under the assumption of flavour universality of the SUSY breaking\nsector (scalar masses and trilinear couplings) at the GUT scaleMX , new lepton flavour non\u2013\nconserving couplings are induced at low energy by the matrix of neutrino Yukawa couplings\n4\nmD\/v through renormalization group running of the scalar lepton masses. The latter gener-\nates non\u2013zero flavour non\u2013diagonal entries in the slepton mass matrices and in the trilinear\nscalar couplings. These were shown to be proportional to mDm\n\u2020\nD [42]. More specifically,\nusing the leading\u2013log approximation, one can estimate [42, 43, 44] the branching ratio of\nthe charged lepton decays \u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3, \u2113i(\u2113j) = \u03c4, \u00b5, e for i(j) = 3, 2, 1, i > j,\nBR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3) \u2243 \u03b13\n(\n(3 + a0)m\n2\n0\n8 \u03c02m4S GF v\n2\n)2 \u2223\u2223\u2223(mDLm\u2020D)ij\u2223\u2223\u22232 tan2 \u03b2 , (9)\nwhere mS denotes a slepton mass, m0 is the universal mass scale of the sparticles and a0 is\na trilinear coupling (all at MX). The diagonal matrix L reads: L = diag(L1, L2, L3), where\nLi = logMX\/Mi. To get a feeling for the numbers involved, for a0 = O(1), mS \u223c m0 \u223c 102\nGeV, MX \u223c 1016 GeV and Mi \u223c 1010 GeV, one finds\nBR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3) \u223c 10\u221215 tan2 \u03b2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(mDm\n\u2020\nD)ij\nGeV2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n. (10)\nThis is within the planned sensitivity of the next generation experiments. The predicted\nvalues of BR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3) are strongly dependent on the SUSY parameters, a topic beyond\nthe scope of the present article.\nSince the rates of LFV charged lepton decays depend on mDm\n\u2020\nD, the decay asymmetry\n\u03b51 depends on m\n\u2020\nDmD and leptonic CP violating effects originate from m\u03bd \u223c mDmTD, one\nmight in a given model expect some interplay between these three phenomena. We shall\ninvestigate this in Sections 4 and 5.\n3 How it Works\n3.1 Parameterizations\nAt low energy and in the case of N flavour neutrinos, we can measure, in principle, the N\u00d7N\nlight neutrino mass matrix m\u03bd . It contains N mass eigenstates,\n1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) mixing angles\nand 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) phases, thus altogether N2 measurable quantities. Of these 1\n2\nN(N + 1) are\nreal and 1\n2\nN(N\u22121) are CP violating phases. One can easily count the number of all see\u2013saw\nparameters in the weak basis, in which both, MR and the charged lepton mass matrix are\nreal and diagonal. In this basis the Dirac mass matrix mD contains all information about\nCP violation. We shall discuss now three possible parameterizations of mD.\n1. Bi\u2013unitary parametrization\nWith N light and N \u2032 heavy neutrinos, denoting this particle content as the \u201cN \u00d7 N \u2032\nsee\u2013saw model\u201d, one can write the complex N \u00d7N \u2032 Dirac mass matrix as\nmD = U\n\u2020\nLm\ndiag\nD UR , (11)\nwhere UL (UR) is a unitary N\u00d7N (N \u2032\u00d7N \u2032) matrix and mdiagD is a real matrix with non\u2013zero\nelements only at its ii entries. Thus, mdiagD contains min(N,N\n\u2032) real parameters we shall\ndenote by mDi. Any unitary N \u00d7N matrix can be written as\nU = ei\u03a6 P U\u02dc Q , (12)\n5\nwhere P \u2261 diag(1, ei\u03c61, ei\u03c62 , . . .) and Q \u2261 diag(1, ei\u03b1, ei\u03b2, . . .) are diagonal phase matrices\nwith (N \u2212 1) phases, and U\u02dc is a unitary \u201cCKM\u2013like\u201d matrix containing 1\n2\n(N \u2212 2)(N \u2212 1)\nphases and 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) angles. In total U contains 1\n2\nN(N + 1) phases. Parameterizing U \u2020L\nand UR in the same way, we get for the Dirac mass matrix\nmD = e\ni(\u03a6R+\u03a6L) PL U\u02dcLQLm\ndiag\nD PR U\u02dcRQR , (13)\nwhere the index L(R) indicates that the angles and phases in the respective matrices also\ncarry this index. The common phase (\u03a6R + \u03a6L) and the (N \u2212 1) phases in PL can be\nabsorbed by a redefinition of the charged lepton fields. \u00bfFrom the original (N + N \u2032 \u2212 2)\nphases in the matrices QL and PR, only (N + N\n\u2032 \u2212 2) \u2212 (max(N,N \u2032) \u2212 1) appear in the\nproduct QLm\ndiag\nD PR. Thus, we can write\nmD = U\u02dcLW m\ndiag\nD U\u02dcRQR , (14)\nwhere W is a diagonal matrix containing N \u2032 \u2212 1 (N \u2212 1) phases if N > N \u2032 (N \u2264 N \u2032). The\nnumber of physical CP violating phases is therefore\n1\n2\nN(N + 1) + 1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 + 1)\u2212 2\u2212 (N \u2212 1)\u2212 (max(N,N \u2032)\u2212 1)\n= 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) + 1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 + 1)\u2212max(N,N \u2032)\n= 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 3) + 1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 \u2212 3) +N \u2032 +min(N,N \u2032)\n. (15)\nAdding the number of the real parameters mDi, min(N,N\n\u2032), of the massesMi, N \u2032, and of the\nangles in U\u02dcL (U\u02dcR),\n1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) (1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 \u2212 1)), we obtain the total number of parameters in\nthe N \u00d7N \u2032 see\u2013saw model. The result is N(N \u22121)+N \u2032(N \u2032+1)\u2212max(N,N \u2032)+min(N,N \u2032).\nFor N = N \u2032 this reduces to 2N2 parameters, N(N \u2212 1) phases and N(N + 1) real one. In\ngeneral, the difference between the number of real parameters and phases is N +N \u2032.\nComparing the number of low and high energy parameters, we see that integrating out\nthe heavy Majorana neutrinos leave us short of a total of N \u2032(N \u2032 + 1)\u2212 N \u2212max(N,N \u2032) +\nmin(N,N \u2032) parameters, of which 1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 + 1) \u2212 N + min(N,N \u2032) are real and 1\n2\nN \u2032(N \u2032 +\n1) \u2212 max(N,N \u2032) are phases. For N = N \u2032 half of the parameters \u201cget lost\u201d, 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1)\nphases and 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) real ones. The counting of the independent physical parameters in\nmD through the independent parameters in UL,R made above, is valid for |N \u2212 N \u2032| = 0, 1.\nFor arbitrary |N \u2212 N \u2032| > 1, the total number of independent physical parameters in mD is\nobviously N(2N \u2032\u22121), of which NN \u2032 are moduli and N(N \u2032\u22121) are phases. Their number is\nsmaller than the number our counting through UL,R gives because when |N \u2212N \u2032| > 1 there\nare more unphysical parameters in UL,R.\nThe usual 3\u00d73 see\u2013saw model has therefore 18 parameters, which are composed of 12 real\nparameters and 6 phases. Integrating out the heavy Majorana neutrinos leaves us with the\nobservable mass matrix m\u03bd , which contains 9 observable parameters \u2014 6 real and 3 phases.\nHence, half of the parameters of the model get \u201clost\u201d at low energy. However, in approaches\nto reconstruct the high energy physics from low energy data, one usually assumes the ex-\nistence of relations between mass matrices (e.g., mD = mup), which reduces the number of\nunknown parameters. If in addition specific textures in the matrices are implemented, the\nsituation improves further.\n6\nIt is worth noting that \u201creduced\u201d models allow for a simpler connection between the\nhigh and low energy physics phenomena. Consider the minimal 3\u00d72 see\u2013saw model [12, 13],\nwhich contains only 2 heavy Majorana neutrinos. This model has altogether 11 parameters,\n8 real and 3 CP violating phases. Comparing with the 9 observable parameters in m\u03bd , we\nsee that only 2 real parameters are \u201cmissing\u201d at low energy. Interestingly, this makes the\nmodel superior to the even more reduced \u201ctoo minimal\u201d 2\u00d7 2 see\u2013saw model with 2 heavy\nand 2 light Majorana neutrinos 2. The latter has 8 parameters, two of which are phases, and\nthis has to be compared with the 4 parameters (including 1 phase) a 2 \u00d7 2 light Majorana\nneutrino mass matrix effectively contains.\nWe shall use in the analysis that follows the bi\u2013unitary parametrization. Before proceed-\ning further, however, we will describe briefly two alternative parameterizations.\n2. Triangular parametrization\nThis parametrization relies on the property that any complex matrix can be written as a\nproduct of a unitary and a lower triangular matrix [14]:\nmD = v U Y . (16)\nThe triangular matrix Y has zeros as entries above the diagonal axis and contains 3 phases\nin the three off\u2013diagonal entries. The unitary matrix U can be parametrized in analogy to\nthe PMNS matrix, i.e., in the form of a CKM\u2013like matrix with one phase times a diagonal\nmatrix containing the other two phases. An analysis of leptogenesis using this parametriza-\ntion was performed in Ref. [15].\n3. Orthogonal parametrization\nThe following parametrization shows clearly that without any assumptions there is no con-\nnection between the low and high energy parameters governing respectively neutrino mixing\nand leptogenesis. One can write the Dirac matrix as [43]\nmD = i UPMNS\n\u221a\nmdiag\u03bd R\n\u221a\nMR , (17)\nwhere R is a complex orthogonal matrix. It contains 3 real parameters and 3 phases, which,\ntogether with the 3 Mi and the 9 parameters from m\u03bd , sums up again to a total of 18\nparameters. In Eq. (17), mD seems to contain all 18 parameters. However, the product\u221a\nmdiag\u03bd R\n\u221a\nMR includes only 9 independent parameters.\n3.2 Leptogenesis, m\u03bd and LFV Charged Lepton Decays\nThe decay asymmetry \u03b51 depends on the three mass eigenvalues Mi and on the hermitian\nmatrix m\u2020DmD. Due to its hermiticity, the latter will have a reduced number of parameters\nwith respect to mD: for every row (or column) we get rid of one complex number, or\nequivalently of one real parameter and one phase. Indeed,\nm\u2020DmD =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nU \u2020R (m\ndiag\nD )\n2 UR , bi\u2013unitary;\nv2 Y \u2020 Y , triangular;\n\u221a\nMRR\n\u2020mdiag\u03bd R\n\u221a\nMR , orthogonal,\n(18)\n2This model can be motivated by a vanishing mixing angle \u03b83. The \u03bde oscillates then into the flavor state\n(\u03bd\u00b5 + \u03bd\u03c4 )\/\n\u221a\n2 with an amplitude sin2 2\u03b8\u2299.\n7\ndepends on 15\u22126 = 9 parameters, which for the bi\u2013unitary parametrization are the 3 angles\nand 3 phases in UR and the 3 mass eigenvalues mDi; for the triangular parametrization, these\nare the 6 real entries and 3 phases in Y . In the orthogonal parametrization we have the 9\nparameters from the combination\n\u221a\nmdiag\u03bd R\n\u221a\nMR. Of course, there are three leptogenesis\nphases in each case.\nThe form of m\u2020DmD in the orthogonal parametrization shows that the PMNS matrix\nUPMNS does not enter into the expression for \u03b51 and that there is, in general, no connection\nbetween the low energy observables in UPMNS and leptogenesis. In particular, there is no\nconnection between the low and high energy CP violation. Figure 1 shows a sketch of the\nsituation: in order to connect low energy lepton charge non\u2013conservation and CP violation\neffects (making an assumption about the currently unknown values of the phases and the\nlowest neutrino mass eigenstate) with the baryon asymmetry of the Universe YB, there must\nexist a connection between the light left\u2013handed neutrinos \u03bdL and the heavy right\u2013handed\nMajorana neutrinos NR. This typically involves some kind of see\u2013saw mechanism within the\nframework of a GUT theory. The NR produce YB via the leptogenesis mechanism. Without\nthe crucial GUT or see\u2013saw link there is no connection.\nInserting the form of mD from Eqs. (11) and (16) in Eq. (4) shows\n3 that all six phases\nin mD contribute to the phases in UPMNS:\nm\u03bd =\n{ \u2212U \u2020LmdiagD URM\u22121R UTR mdiagD U\u2217L , bi\u2013unitary;\n\u2212v2 U Y M\u22121R Y T UT , triangular.\n(19)\nOne may expect that a connection between the high and low energy CP violation would\nexist if three of the phases in mD are negligible, so that the numbers of the CP violating\nphases at high and low energy coincide. In order to have successful leptogenesis, the negligi-\nble phases should not be those appearing in Y or UR. Thus, one can assume that, e.g., U in\nEq. (16) is real, as has been done in [15]. We shall pursue a different approach and consider\nthe bi\u2013unitary parametrization keeping all the phases.\nIn supersymmetric versions of the see\u2013saw mechanism, the rates of LFV charged lepton\ndecays, such as \u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3, and the T violating asymmetries in, e.g., \u00b5\u2192 3e decay, depend\napproximately 4 on [42, 43, 44]\nmDm\n\u2020\nD =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nU \u2020L (m\ndiag\nD )\n2 UL , bi\u2013unitary;\nv2 U Y Y \u2020 U \u2020 , triangular;\nUPMNS\n\u221a\nmdiag\u03bd RMRR\n\u2020\n\u221a\nmdiag\u03bd U\n\u2020\nPMNS , orthogonal.\n(20)\nIn principle, taking also a possible data on the electric dipole moments of charged leptons\ninto account, there are enough observables for a full reconstruction of the see\u2013saw model.\nThe bi\u2013unitary parametrization seems to be especially convenient for this purpose.\n3Note that inserting Eq. (17) in (4) yields an identity.\n4The actual dependence is a bit more evolved, see Section 2.2.\n8\n4 The bi\u2013Unitary Parametrization for mD\nAs we saw, the 3 \u00d7 3 see\u2013saw model has 6 phases as possible sources of leptonic CP vio-\nlation. The 3 low energy CP violating phases depend, in general, on all 6 see\u2013saw phases.\nThe unitary matrices UL and UR have a simple interpretation: UL diagonalizes mDm\n\u2020\nD, thus\nbeing responsible for lepton flavor violation, and UR diagonalizes m\n\u2020\nDmD, therefore being\nresponsible for the total lepton number non\u2013conservation. Since the latter is a necessary\ningredient of leptogenesis and leads also to (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay, one might assume naively that\nthere will be a certain connection between the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay rate and YB. We shall see that\nwithin certain plausible assumptions this is indeed the case.\nThe first step is to determine the form of UL and UR. Since in any GUT theory mD is\nrelated to the known charged fermion masses, we can assume a hierarchical structure of mD,\ni.e., mD3 \u226b mD2 \u226b mD1, such that\nmD \u2243 diag(mD1, mD2, mD3) +O(few%) , (21)\nwhere the second term indicates that there are corrections not exceeding 10 % on both the\ndiagonal and off\u2013diagonal entries of mD. It is helpful to parametrize U\n\u2020\nL and UR in analogy\nto UPMNS in Eq. (2), with the angles \u03b8i replaced by \u03b8L(R)i. In what regards the CP violating\nphases, we shall denote the phases in U\u02dcR and U\u02dc\n\u2020\nL with \u03b4R and \u03b4L respectively, the two \u201cMa-\njorana phases\u201d in QR by \u03b1R, \u03b2R+ \u03b4R and the two phases in W by \u03b1W and \u03b2W + \u03b4L. In order\nto obtain a hierarchical mD we shall assume that sL(R)1 \u223c 10\u22121 > sL(R)2 \u223c 10\u22122 > sL(R)3\nwith sL(R)3 <\u223c 10\u22123, as well as that mD3 \u226b mD2 \u226b mD1. These assumptions are inspired\nby observed mixing in the quark sector and by the known hierarchies between the masses of\nthe up\u2013type quarks, between the masses of the down\u2013type quarks and between the charged\nlepton masses. In the numerical estimates we give in what follows we will always use the\nvalues mD1 \u223c 100 MeV, mD2 \u223c 1 GeV and mD3 \u223c 100 GeV, which to a certain degree are\nsuggested by the up\u2013quark mass values.\nOnce U \u2020L (UR) is chosen to contain hierarchical mixing angles, the requirement that mD\ntakes the form (21) implies hierarchical mixing angles also for UR (U\n\u2020\nL). The structure of the\nDirac matrix is then found to be\nmD \u2243\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nmD1 \u2212 m\u02dcD2 s1L s1R ei\u03b1R m\u02dcD2 s1L ei(\u03b2R+\u03b4R\u2212\u03b4L) m\u02dcD3 s3L\n\u2212m\u02dcD2 s1R ei\u03b1R m\u02dcD2 ei(\u03b2R+\u03b4R) m\u02dcD3 s2L\nm\u02dcD3\n(\ns1R s2R \u2212 ei\u03b4R s3R\n) \u2212ei\u03b1R m\u02dcD3 s2R ei(\u03b2R+\u03b4R) m\u02dcD3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (22)\nwhere m\u02dcD2 \u2261 mD2 ei\u03b1W , m\u02dcD3 \u2261 mD3 ei(\u03b2W+\u03b4L) and we have set all the cos \u03b8L(R)i to one.\nProducts of the sin \u03b8L(R)i which are smaller than 10\n\u22123 are neglected. We have neglected also\nterms of order O(mD3 s2L s2R) with respect to mD2. Not surprisingly, the off\u2013diagonal en-\ntries of mD are suppressed with respect to the diagonal terms by the small quantities siL(R),\ni = 1, 2, 3. A hierarchical structure of mD is most naturally described using the bi\u2013unitary\nparametrization.\nRather than tuning the parameters involved in the bi\u2013unitary parametrization to repro-\nduce precisely the neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles determined from the\n9\navailable neutrino oscillation data, we shall focus only on the dependence of the quantities\nof interest on the parameters in mD and MR: we are primarily interested to find out under\nwhich circumstances a connection between the neutrino mixing related phenomena and lep-\ntogenesis is possible. We made nevertheless extensive consistency checks regarding the form\nof m\u03bd as obtained with the matrix mD in Eq. (22) and with MR. Using the form of mD\ngiven in Eq. (22) and assuming a hierarchy for Mi, M1 \u226a M2 \u226a M3, from Eq. (4) one can\nobtain a theoretically predicted expression for the low energy neutrino mass matrix, mth\u03bd .\nThe form of mth\u03bd should be confronted with the neutrino mass matrix which is obtained from\nEq. (1), mexp\u03bd . For the angles \u03b81 \u2261 \u03b8\u2299 and \u03b82 \u2261 \u03b8atm, we use the best fit values found in\nthe analyzes [5, 6] of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data, respectively: tan2 \u03b8\u2299 = 0.46\nand sin2 2\u03b8atm = 1. The angle \u03b83 is varied within its allowed 3\u03c3 range, sin\n2 \u03b83 < 0.05, while\nthe three CP violating phases \u03b4, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are treated as free parameters. For the normal\nhierarchical neutrino mass spectrum one has: m1 \u226a m2 \u2243\n\u221a\n\u2206m2\u2299 \u226a m3 \u2243\n\u221a\n\u2206m2atm, where\n\u2206m2\u2299 > 0 and \u2206m\n2\natm > 0 drive the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. In the nu-\nmerical estimates which follow we use \u2206m2\u2299 = 7.3\u00d710\u22125 eV2 [5] and \u2206m2atm = 2.7\u00d710\u22123 eV2\n[6].\nThe expression for mth\u03bd and the analysis of interest simplify considerably if the hierarchy\nbetween the masses M1 and M2 is relatively mild:\nM2 \u2243 10M1 . (23)\nIt is not difficult to convince oneself that if Eq. (23) holds and if in addition \u2014 in agreement\nwith the hierarchy requirement in mD \u2014 the relation\nmD3 s2R(L) \u2243 10\u22122mD3 \u2243 mD2 (24)\nholds, the form of mth\u03bd leads to sin\n2 2\u03b82 \u2261 sin2 2\u03b8atm \u2243 1 without any further fine\u2013tuning\nas long as the terms \u221d 1\/M3 in Eq. (26) give a sub\u2013leading contribution to mth\u03bd . This is\nensured provided the inequality\nM3 \u226b s\u221222RM2 \u223c 104M2 , (25)\nimplying a strong hierarchy between M2 and M3, holds. The existence of a mild hierarchy\nbetween M1 and M2, Eq. (23), and of a strong hierarchy between M2 and M3, Eq. (25) is,\nas we will see, also compatible with the requirement of effective leptogenesis.\n10\nUnder the conditions (23) \u2014 (25) the matrix mth\u03bd takes a relatively simple form:\n(mth\u03bd )ee \u2243\n(mD1 \u2212 s1Ls1RmD2ei\u03b1W )2\nM1\n+\ns21Lm\n2\nD2e\n2i(\u03b1W+\u03b1R)\nM2\n(mth\u03bd )e\u00b5 \u2243 \u2212\n(mD1 \u2212 s1Ls1RmD2ei\u03b1W )s1RmD2ei\u03b1W\nM1\n+\nm2D2s1Le\n2i(\u03b1W+\u03b1R)\nM2\n(mth\u03bd )e\u03c4 \u2243\n(mD1 \u2212 s1Ls1RmD2ei\u03b1W )(s1Ls2R \u2212 s3Rei\u03b4R)m2D3e2i(\u03b2W+\u03b4L)\nM1\n\u2212\nmD2mD3s1Ls2Re\ni(\u03b1W+\u03b2W+\u03b4L+2\u03b1R)\nM2\n(mth\u03bd )\u00b5\u00b5 \u2243 \u2212\nm2D2\nM2\ne2i(\u03b1R+\u03b1W ) ,\n(mth\u03bd )\u00b5\u03c4 \u2243\nmD2mD3\nM2\ns2R e\ni(2\u03b1R+\u03b1W+\u03b2W+\u03b4L) ,\n(mth\u03bd )\u03c4\u03c4 \u2243 \u2212\nm2D3\nM2\ns22R e\n2i(\u03b1R+\u03b2W+\u03b4L) ,\n(26)\nwhere we have not written explicitly the sub\u2013leading terms \u221d 1\/M1 and \u221d 1\/M3. Further\nanalysis shows that for the generic values of the parameters mDi and sjL(R) we use, the\nmatrix mth\u03bd thus obtained leads to a value of \u03b8\u2299 \u2261 \u03b81 compatible with the observations for,\ne.g., M2 \u223c 1010 GeV. The value of \u03b8\u2299 is particularly sensitive to the specific value of mD1\nchosen: a very good agreement with the best fit value tan2 \u03b8\u2299 \u223c= (0.42\u2212 0.46) determined in\nthe analyses of the solar neutrino data is obtained for mD1 \u223c= (70\u2212 90) MeV.\nIn what regards the angle \u03b83, formD1 \u223c 100 MeV and s1L \u2243 (0.10\u22120.25) and the standard\nvalues of the other parameters we use, one generically has: sin \u03b83 \u223c s1L\/\n\u221a\n2. Consequently,\nsin2 \u03b83 is relatively large: typically one has sin\n2 \u03b83 >\u223c 0.005. However, it is also possible to\nfine\u2013tune the values of the parameters involved in the analysis to get sin2 \u03b83 < 0.005 and\nthis latter possibility cannot be ruled out.\nThe above analysis shows that the assumptions we made about the magnitude of the\nangles in UL and UR and of the values of mDi are very well in agreement with the existing\ndata. We find, in particular, that the angle \u03b83 can be relatively large (sin\n2 \u03b83 >\u223c 0.005\u22120.010),\nwhich has important implications for the searches for CP violation in neutrino oscillations.\nIn fact, we shall see that under the assumptions made, the CP violating observables in\nneutrino oscillations can be sizable.\n4.1 Leptogenesis in the bi\u2013Unitary Parametrization\nIn the context of leptogenesis the lepton asymmetry depends on the parameter m\u2020DmD, as\ndiscussed in Section 2. Using Eq. (18) we find for (m\u2020DmD)11 to leading order:\n(m\u2020DmD)11 \u2243 m2D2 s21R +m2D3\n(\ns21R s\n2\n2R \u2212 2 cos \u03b4R s1R s2R s3R + s23R\n)\n\u2243 (m2D2 +m2D3 s22R) s21R . (27)\n11\nThe decay asymmetry \u03b51 receives contribution from\nIm\n{\n(m\u2020DmD)\n2\n12\n}\n\u2243\n2 (cos\u03b1R s1R (m\n2\nD2 +m\n2\nD3 s\n2\n2R)\u2212m2D3 cos(\u03b1R \u2212 \u03b4R) s2R s3R)(\nsin\u03b1R s1R\n(\nm2D2 +m\n2\nD3 s\n2\n2R\n)\u2212m2D3 sin(\u03b1R \u2212 \u03b4R) s2R s3R)\n\u2243 (m2D2 +m2D3 s22R)2 s21R sin 2\u03b1R ,\n(28)\nas well as from\nIm\n{\n(m\u2020DmD)\n2\n13\n}\n\u2243\n2m4D3 (cos(\u03b2R + \u03b4R) s1R s2R \u2212 cos\u03b2R s3R) (sin(\u03b2R + \u03b4R) s1R s2R \u2212 sin \u03b2R s3R)\n\u2243 m4D3 s21R s22R sin 2(\u03b2R + \u03b4R) ,\n(29)\nwhere s3R was neglected in the last expression. Assuming a hierarchical mass spectrum of\nthe heavy Majorana neutrinos one finds for the decay asymmetry\n\u03b51 \u2243 \u22123\n2\n1\n8 \u03c0 v2\n(\n(m2D2 +m\n2\nD3 s\n2\n2R) sin 2\u03b1R\nM1\nM2\n+\nm4D3 s\n2\n2R\nm2D2 +m\n2\nD3 s\n2\n2R\nsin 2(\u03b2R + \u03b4R)\nM1\nM3\n)\n.\n(30)\nTherefore, we can identify \u03b1R and (\u03b2R + \u03b4R) as the leptogenesis phases. Note that, as it\nshould, \u03b51 = 0 for \u03b1R, \u03b2R, \u03b4R = 0, \u03c0\/2, \u03c0. Taking mD2 \u2243 10\u22122mD3 and s2R \u2243 10\u22122, we can\nestimate the decay asymmetry as 5\n\u03b51 \u223c \u221210\u22129\n(mD3\nGeV\n)2 (\nsin 2\u03b1R\nM1\nM2\n+ 103 sin 2(\u03b2R + \u03b4R)\nM1\nM3\n)\n. (31)\nAs discussed earlier, the heavy Majorana neutrino masses Mi are also expected to posses a\nhierarchy. Under the condition (25) of a strong hierarchy between M2 and M3, the second\nterm in the last equation is negligible, and only the phase \u03b1R is relevant for leptogenesis. If\nfurther one has mD3 \u223c 102 GeV, as is suggested by up\u2013quark mass values, it is possible to\nhave \u03b51 \u223c 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127 if, e.g., M1\/M2 \u223c 0.1, which is compatible with the requirement of\na mild hierarchy between M1 and M2, Eq. (23) which in the previous Section was shown to\nbe also compatible with the low energy neutrino phenomenology.\nIdentifying mD with the down\u2013quark or charged lepton mass matrix, i.e., mD3 \u223c 1 GeV,\nleads to a rather small value of \u03b51 for M1 \u226a M2 \u226a M3. In this case the lepton asymmetry\ncan only be amplified to the requisite value by the resonance mechanism [33] which is oper-\native for quasi\u2013degenerate heavy Majorana neutrinos. Thus, leptogenesis with hierarchical\nneutrino Majorana and Dirac masses prefers up\u2013quark type masses for the latter, a fact first\nnoticed in [17].\nThe \u201ceffective mass\u201d m\u02dc1, that represents a sensitive parameter for the Boltzmann equa-\ntions, is given by\nm\u02dc1 =\n(m\u2020DmD)11\nM1\n\u223c\n(mD3\nGeV\n)2 (109GeV\nM1\n)\n10\u22125 eV . (32)\n5Note that the form of this equation resembles Eq. (17) in the second paper in Ref. [8]. A type II see\u2013saw\nmechanism was used in that work.\n12\nFor mD3 \u223c 102 GeV and M1 of 109 to 1010 GeV, acceptable values of 10\u22121 to 10\u22123 eV for\nm\u02dc1 are obtained. This leads to values of \u03ba \u223c 10\u22121 \u2212 10\u22123. Assuming that the sine of the\nphases in Eq. (30) is not small, a value of YB \u223c 10\u221210 is therefore \u201cnaturally\u201d obtained for,\ne.g., mD3 \u223c 102 GeV,M1 \u223c 109 GeV, andM2 \u223c 1010GeV\u226aM3 \u223c 1015 GeV. The indicated\nvalues of M1, M2 and M3 are also in very good agreement with the constraints Eqs. (23)\nand (25).\n4.2 LFV Charged Lepton Decays\nAccording to Eq. (9), the branching ratios of the LFV charged lepton decays, BR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j+\u03b3),\ndepend on (mDLm\n\u2020\nD). We have calculated this matrix with the usual approximations for\nthe masses and angles and found the leading terms to be\n(mDLm\n\u2020\nD)21 \u2243 m2D2 s1L L2,\n(mDLm\n\u2020\nD)31 \u2243 m2D3 (s1Ls2L \u2212 s3L ei\u03b4L)L3 +mD3mD2s1Ls2R(L2 \u2212 L3).\n(mDLm\n\u2020\nD)32 \u2243 m2D3 s2L L3.\n(33)\nBarring accidental cancellations in the expression for (mDLm\n\u2020\nD)31, we obtain the following\ngeneral relation between the branching ratios of interest 6:\nBR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+ \u03b3)\u226b BR(\u03c4 \u2192 e+ \u03b3)\u226b BR(\u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3) . (34)\nIf we use the generic values of the relevant parameters we work with, we find\nBR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+ \u03b3) \u223c 102BR(\u03c4 \u2192 e+ \u03b3) \u223c 105BR(\u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3) . (35)\nThe results do not differ significantly from the results obtained by using a common mass\nscale M and taking the log\u2013terms out of the matrix, i.e., for (mDm\n\u2020\nD) logMX\/M instead of\nmDLm\n\u2020\nD. Note that thoughmD contains UL and UR, only the angles and phases of UL appear\nin BR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3), which confirms that Eq. (20) represents a rather good approximation\nfor estimating BR(\u2113i \u2192 \u2113j + \u03b3).\n5 Leptogenesis, (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay and Low Energy Leptonic\nCP Violation\nWe shall investigate next whether there exists a relation between the high energy CP viola-\ntion leading to the decay asymmetry Eq. (30) and low energy observables. We will consider\nthe effective Majorana mass in (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay and the CP violating asymmetry in neutrino\noscillations.\n6Obviously, the relation we obtain does not hold if, e.g., the accidental cancellation (s1Ls2L\u2212s3Lei\u03b4L) = 0\ntakes place. The latter requires, however, a fine\u2013tuning of the values of 4 parameters.\n13\n5.1 The Effective Majorana Mass in (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013Decay\nThe observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay would provide direct evidence for the non\u2013conservation of\nthe total lepton charge, which is a necessary ingredient for the leptogenesis mechanism. In\n(\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay one measures the absolute value of the ee element of m\u03bd . Given the form of\nmD in Eq. (22), it is not difficult to find this element:\n\u3008m\u3009 \u2243 (mD1 \u2212 s1Ls1RmD2e\ni\u03b1W )2\nM1\n+\nm2D2e\n2i(\u03b1W+\u03b1R)\nM2\n+\nm2D3 s\n2\n3L e\n2i(\u03b2R+\u03b2W+\u03b4R)\nM3\n. (36)\nThe term of order m2D3 contains, in particular, the parameters \u03b1W and \u03b2W , which do not in-\nfluence the baryon asymmetry. The condition that this term does not contribute significantly\nto |\u3008m\u3009| is\nm2D3\nM3\ns23L \u226a\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nm2D2\nM1\ns21L s\n2\n1R\nm2D2\nM2\ns21L\n\u21d2 M3 \u226b\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nM1\n(\nmD3\nmD2\n)2\ns23L\ns21L s\n2\n1R\n\u223c 102M1\nM2\n(\nmD3\nmD2\n)2\ns23L\ns21L\n\u223cM2\n, (37)\nwhich is compatible with Eqs. (24) and (26) and the hierarchy betweenM3 andM1,2, required\nfor generating a sufficient baryon asymmetry (see the discussion after Eq. (31)). The first\ntwo terms in (36) can contribute comparably to |\u3008m\u3009| unless M2 s21R \u226bM1 orM2 s21R \u226aM1.\nFrom the two main possibilities for mD, the choice of the up\u2013quark type matrix, mD \u223c mup,\nfavored by leptogenesis in the case of hierarchical Mi and mD, leads to |\u3008m\u3009| which is larger\nby a factor of (mc\/ms,\u00b5)\n2 \u223c 102 then in the case of mD \u223c mdown, mc (ms) being the charm\n(strange) quark mass. If mD2 \u223c 1 GeV and s21L(R) \u223c (10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121) (see Eq. (25)), one finds\nfor M1 \u223c 109 GeV and M2 \u223c 1010 GeV that |\u3008m\u3009| \u223c (0.001 \u2212 0.01) eV 7, which may be\nwithin the reach of the 10t version of the GENIUS experiment [45].\nIf condition (37) holds, only the leptogenesis parameter \u03b1R appears in the effective Majo-\nrana mass |\u3008m\u3009|. This condition corresponds to a rather strong hierarchy between the masses\nof the Ni and thus to a decoupling of the heaviest Majorana neutrino N3. In this case, one\nsees from Eq. (30) that only the term proportional to sin 2\u03b1R contributes to YB and there\nis a direct correlation between the rate of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay and the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse. For a mild hierarchy between the masses Mi, the unknown phases \u03b1W and \u03b2W\nspoil any simple connection between |\u3008m\u3009| and YB.\n5.2 CP Violation in Leptogenesis and in Neutrino Oscillations\nManifest CP violation can be probed in neutrino oscillation experiments (see, e.g., [24]).\nThe corresponding CP violating observables depend on the rephasing invariant quantity\n[16] JCP \u2014 the leptonic analog of the Jarlskog invariant. The following form [15] of JCP is\nparticularly suited for our analysis:\nJCP = \u2212 Im(h12 h23 h31)\n\u2206m221\u2206m\n2\n31\u2206m\n2\n32\n, where h = m\u03bdm\n\u2020\n\u03bd . (38)\n7We would like to emphasize that the numerical values for the observables we give should be taken not\ntoo literally: a spread within one order of magnitude, as included in the prediction for |\u3008m\u3009| we give, should\nbe allowed for.\n14\nThe invariant JCP can be calculated using Eqs. (4) and (22). The resulting expression is\nrather long and which is the leading term depends on the degree of hierarchy of the heavy\nMajorana neutrino masses. In general, however, we find that JCP vanishes for mD2 = 0\nand\/or 1\/M3 = 0. These approximations correspond effectively to a 2 flavour neutrino mix-\ning case, and consequently to an absence of Dirac\u2013like CP violation. In general, all six\nphases contribute to JCP , as is suggested by Eq. (19).\nAs an example, let us consider the hierarchy M1 \u2243 10\u22121M2 \u2243 10\u22124M3. Then there are\nfour leading terms in JCP , which are proportional to (M1M\n4\n2 M3)\n\u22121, (M1M3)\u22123, (M1M2M43 )\n\u22121\nand (M1M2M3)\n\u22122, respectively. They read:\nIm(h12 h23 h31) \u2243 \u22122m\n5\nD2m\n7\nD3 s\n2\n1L s\n2\n1R s2L s\n5\n2R\nM1M\n4\n2 M3\ncos 2\u03b1R sin (\u03b1W \u2212 (\u03b2W + \u03b4L) + 2\u03b1R \u2212 2(\u03b2R + \u03b4R))\n\u2212 m\n5\nD2m\n7\nD3 s\n2\n1L s\n5\n1R s2L s3R\nM31 M\n3\n3\nsin (\u03b1W \u2212 2 \u03b2R \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L \u2212 \u03b4R)\n+\n2m4D2m\n8\nD3 s\n2\n1L s\n2\n1R s2L s3L\nM1M2M\n4\n3\ncos 2\u03b1R sin \u03b4L\n+\nm7D2m\n5\nD3 s\n2\n1L s\n4\n1R s2L s2R\nM21 M\n2\n2 M\n2\n3\n(2 sin (\u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L) + sin (\u03b1W \u2212 4\u03b1R \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L))\n+\nm5D2m\n5\nD3 s\n2\n1L s\n4\n1R s2L s2R\nM21 M\n2\n2 M\n2\n3\n(m2D2 (2 sin (\u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L) + sin (\u03b1W \u2212 4\u03b1R \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L))\n+m2D3 s\n2\n2R sin (\u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L)) ,\n(39)\nwhich illustrates our general conclusions mentioned above. Choosing a different hierarchy\nof the heavy Majorana neutrino masses will lead to the presence of different terms with\ndifferent combinations of the parameters, especially of the phases.\nOf the 6 independent physical CP violating phases of the see\u2013saw model, 5 phases are\npresent in Eq. (39), namely \u03b1R, \u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L, \u03b2R, \u03b4R and \u03b4L. This can be understood\nas being due to the fact that in the approximations we use mD1 is neglected. Setting in\naddition s3L(R) to zero should remove two more phases from the parameter space. Indeed,\none finds from Eq. (39) that only three independent phases (\u03b1R, \u03b1W \u2212\u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L and \u03b2R+ \u03b4R)\nenter into the expression for JCP in this case. Order\u2013of\u2013magnitude\u2013wise we can predict the\nmagnitude of the CP violation to be\nJCP \u223c 10\u22122\n(\n109GeV\nM1\n) (\n1010GeV\nM2\n)4 (\n1014GeV\nM3\n)\nsin\n(\n\u03b1W\u2212(\u03b2W+\u03b4L)+2\u03b1R\u22122(\u03b2R+\u03b4R)\n)\n.\n(40)\nOne sees that within the approximation discussed in this paper there is no connection, in\ngeneral, between leptogenesis in Eq. (31) and the low energy CP violation in neutrino os-\ncillations. Successful leptogenesis without low energy CP violation in neutrino oscillations\nis, in principle, possible. This interesting case has recently been discussed in [11]. However,\ngiven the results of the present Subsection, fine\u2013tuning between the values of the different\nphases has to take place in order to have leptogenesis and JCP \u2248 0. Even if there is no\ndirect connection between the leptogenesis and the value of JCP , a measurement of JCP can\nshed light on the \u201cnon\u2013leptogenesis\u201d parameters. We note finally that the decoupling of\nleptogenesis from the low energy Dirac\u2013phase has been noticed to take place in a number of\n15\nmodels as well, e.g. in [10].\nWe comment finally on an interesting special case of Eq. (39). Suppose that the phases\n\u201cconspire\u201d to fulfill the relations \u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L = \u03b2R = \u03b4R = \u03b4L = 0 or, for s3L(R) = 0,\n\u03b1W \u2212 \u03b2W \u2212 \u03b4L = \u03b2R + \u03b4R = 0. Then, only one phase contributes to the JCP asymmetry and\none finds from Eq. (39) that JCP \u221d sin 4\u03b1R. The baryon asymmetry, on the other hand,\nis proportional to sin 2\u03b1R as can be seen from Eqs. (7) and (30). This situation allows for\na correlation between the relative sign of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the\nCP asymmetry in neutrino oscillations. The two quantities posses opposite signs if 2\u03b1R lies\nbetween \u03c0\/2 and \u03c0 and the same signs for values of 2\u03b1R outside this range. The parameter\nspace allowing for this correlation corresponds to the 3 \u00d7 2 see\u2013saw model with 2 texture\nzeros in the Dirac mass matrix discussed in Ref. [12].\n6 Conclusions\nAssuming only a hierarchical structure of the heavy Majorana neutrino masses M1,2,3,M1 \u226a\nM2 \u226a M3, and of the Dirac mass matrix mD of the see\u2013saw mechanism (see Eq. (21)),\nand working in the bi\u2013unitary parametrization of mD, we find that in order to produce a\nsufficient amount of baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis mechanism, the scale of mD\nshould be given by the up\u2013quark masses. In this class of \u201chierarchical\u201d see\u2013saw models,\nthe branching ratios of LFV charged lepton decays, whose dependence on mD is introduced\nby RGE effects within the SUSY GUT version of the model, are predicted to fulfill the\nrelations BR(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5+ \u03b3)\u226b BR(\u03c4 \u2192 e+ \u03b3)\u226b BR(\u00b5\u2192 e+ \u03b3): typically one has BR(\u03c4 \u2192\n\u00b5 + \u03b3) \u223c 102BR(\u03c4 \u2192 e + \u03b3) \u223c 105BR(\u00b5 \u2192 e + \u03b3). We find that the effective Majorana\nmass in (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\u2013decay depends on the CP violating phase controlling the leptogenesis if\none of the heavy Majorana neutrinos is much heavier than the other two, M3 \u226b 104M2.\nA rather mild hierarchy between the masses of the lighter two heavy Majorana neutrinos,\nM2 \u223c 10M1, is required for successful leptogenesis. The hierarchical relations M3 \u226b 104M2\nand M2 \u223c 10M1 with, e.g., M1 \u223c 109 GeV, are also compatible with the low\u2013energy\nneutrino mixing phenomenology. The CP violation effects in neutrino oscillations can be\nobservable. In general, there is no direct connection between the latter and the CP violation\nin leptogenesis. We find, however, that if the CP violating phases of the see\u2013saw model\n\u201cconspire\u201d to satisfy certain relations, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the leptonic\nCP violation rephasing invariant JCP , which determines the magnitude of the CP violation\neffects in neutrino oscillations, depend on the same CP violating phase and their signs are\ncorrelated.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the EC network HPRN-CT-2000-00152 (S.T.P. and\nW.R.), by the Italian MIUR under the program \u201cFenomenologia delle Interazioni Fonda-\nmentali\u201d (S.T.P.), and by the US Department of Energy Grant DE-FG03-91ER40662 (S.P.).\nS.P. would like to thank the Elementary Particle Physics Sector of SISSA (Trieste, Italy)\nand the Inst. de Fisica Teorica of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain) for kind\nhospitality during part of this study.\n16\nReferences\n[1] M.
