Using the concept of \u2018\u2018the AIDS competent community\u2019\u2019, we analysed 44 interviews and 11\nfocus groups with local people.

People spoke of HIV\/AIDS in a\npassive and fatalistic way, expecting outsiders to solve the problem.

Using the concept of the \u2018\u2018AIDS competent\ncommunity\u2019\u2019, we present a study of local community\nresponses to HIV\/AIDS in Kumahuswa, a rural\nZimbabwean community which was one of several\nsites of an HIV-prevention programme. This was run\nby a partnership between two local NGOs and the\nministry of health, using state-of-the-art community\nand clinic-based activities. After three years of\ncombined community-based peer education, free\ncondom distribution and improved clinic-based STI\ntreatment and counselling services, there were no\nreductions in HIV-incidence or health-related risk\nbehaviours in the target populations of six interven-\ntion communities, of which Kumahuswa was one,\ncompared to six matched control communities\n(Gregson et al., 2007).\nMost health and social development programme\nevaluations focus on technical reasons for programme\nsuccess or failure, especially the design and implemen-\ntation of programmes e.g., the cultural relevance of\nprogramme messages, the efficiency and effectiveness\nof programme management, the extent to which\ncommunities are adequately consulted in programme\ndesign and so on. However, Pawson and Tilley (1997)\nargue that programme success depends as much on the\nwider community contexts into which programmes are\ninserted, as on the technical details of the programmes\nthemselves. This insight is summarised in their formula\n\u2018\u2018programme\u0001context\u0002outcome\u2019\u2019. Against this\nbackground, we make no comment on the HIV-\nprevention programme in Kumahuswa itself, rather\nseeking to raise questions about how the wider\n*Corresponding author.

The first is access to HIV\/AIDS-related infor-\nmation. Secondly, the existence of social spaces for\ncritical dialogue where people feel confident, willing\nand able to freely engage in debate about obstacles to\nhealth-enhancing behaviour change, as the first step\ntowards developing collective action plans to tackle\nthese (Freire, 1970, 1973; Vaughan, in press). At this\nstage of the epidemic, even in remote rural areas,\npeople often have the information they need about\nHIV\/AIDS. However, it is frequently presented in\nways they cannot translate into action plans in their\nown lives. What people are often lacking is not\ninformation but safe and trusting social spaces where\nthey can collectively negotiate ways of making un-\nfamiliar health-related information relevant to their\nown specific lives (Campbell, 2003; Epstein, 2007).\nThe third feature of AIDS competence is that\ncommunity members have a sense of ownership of the\nHIV\/AIDS problem and a sense of responsibility for\ncontributing to its management. In conditions of\ndenial and stigma, people may simply fail to acknowl-\nedge the existence of the problem. However, even\nwhen people do acknowledge it, they may respond\npassively, waiting for government or NGOs to solve it\nrather than acknowledging the role they too have to\nplay (Barnett & Whiteside, 2006). Fourthly, commu-\nnity members should feel confident in their ability to\ncontribute to tackling the problem. Fifthly, they\nshould be able to identify ways they can make such\na contribution, either individually or in groups. Even\nsmall-seeming contributions may have powerful ef-\nfects on creating a supportive community context \u0003\nprayers for the sick, greeting a person living with\nHIV\/AIDS politely in the street, assisting an affected\nfamily with housework and so on.\nThe sixth property of an AIDS-competent com-\nmunity \u0003 particularly important \u0003 is the existence of\nbridges or partnerships between local communities\nand outside support agencies \u0003 be they in the public\nsector (e.g., health services), the private sector (e.g.,\nemployers) or civil society (e.g., national AIDS\nactivist groups). Marginalised groupings seldom\nhave the skills or resources to tackle devastating\nsocial problems without substantial support from\noutside agencies with economic and\/or political\ninfluence (Gillies, 1998).\nWe examine the extent to which these six features\nof AIDS competence were present in Kumahuswa in\nthe interests of generating debate about pre-existing\n\u2018\u2018community readiness\u2019\u2019 for interventions.\nResearch methods\nStudy site\nKumahuswa is a small rural town, with much move-\nment in and out of the area. Unemployment is high,\npromoting high levels of sex work amongst women\nbattling to survive economically. The difficult eco-\nnomic climate contributes to low morale amongst\nboth adults and youth, and high levels of alcohol use\/\nabuse. Kumahuswa has high levels of HIV\/AIDS,\nand, as stated above, was the site of an HIV-\nprevention intervention which made no impact on\nthe behaviour or sexual health of local residents\ncompared to a matched control community.\nCase study methodology\nOur case study involved interviews with 44 individuals,\n11 focus groups involving 55 people and fieldworker\ndiaries. We interviewed a range of people living or\nworking in Kumahuswa, focusing on those groupings\nwhose views and actions might impact on the lives,\nhealth and sexuality of local people: teachers, AIDS\nvolunteers, traditional leaders, local community orga-\nnisations (e.g., women\u2019s and youth groups), NGOs,\nschool pupils, out-of-school youth, peer educators,\ntraditional healers, clinic nurses, parents, people living\nwith HIV\/AIDS, church ministers and local govern-\nment officials. Interviews were conducted by the first\nauthor, an experienced Shona-speaking social scientist\nfamiliar with local conditions and customs. She was\nintroduced to informants through a \u2018\u2018village guide\u2019\u2019, a\nlocal resident who had a long association with the\nKumahuswaHIV-prevention programme. Very few of\nthose approached refused to participate. The pro-\ngramme had been highly regarded by local residents,\nwho felt motivated to support associated research. An\nadded incentive was the gift of a T-shirt or soap to\nresearch participants, much appreciated in conditions\nof poverty.\nAn open-ended topic guide elicited information\nabout social dynamics which may have impacted on\npeoples\u2019 receptiveness to the intervention\u2019s goals: in-\ncluding informants\u2019 experiences of local community life;\ntheir views of the causes ofHIV\/AIDS; its impact on the\ncommunity; the role of different groups in HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement; and the potential of peer education,\nAIDS Care 1663\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:2\n7 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\ngrassroots participation andmulti-stakeholder partner-\nships as HIV-prevention strategies.\nInformants signed a consent form, and were\npromised confidentiality and anonymity. Interviews\nwere audio-taped, translated into English and sub-\njected to thematic content analysis (Flick, 1992) by the\nfirst two authors, working closely and engaging in\nextensive discussion of thematerial. The six dimensions\nof AIDS competence served as the core categories of\nour coding frame. These constitute the section headings\nin the presentation of our findings given below.\nFindings and discussion: AIDS competence in\nKumahuswa\nKnowledge\nKumahuswa residents had sound basic knowledge\nabout HIV\/AIDS, including that HIV\/AIDS is pre-\ndominantly sexually transmitted, that it kills, that it\ncan be avoided by ABC strategies (abstain, be faithful\nor condomise). However, various factors may have\nlimited people in turning knowledge into action. The\nmost obvious of these was poverty, which often\nappeared to undermine the psychological empower-\nment most likely to predispose people to exercise\nagency in changing well-established behavioural\nnorms. People repeatedly referred to the negative\nimpacts of poverty on mental health and confidence:\nMy neighbour beats her child whenever they run out\nof food. She displaces her emotions on to the child by\nbeating her. (Woman living with HIV\/AIDS,\n22-years old)\nPeople have no confidence anymore, when they are\ntold there is work some won\u2019t even go, some don\u2019t\nbelieve it. Others have got used to a life without\nwork. (Soccer club chair, man, 31)\nAlso potentially intervening between knowledge and\nactionwere the intertwined emotional, social and gender\ndynamics framing sexual experience and behaviour.\nContrary to much HIV\/AIDS prevention literature,\nwhich often presents women as willing to use condoms,\nbut unable to insist in the face of male reluctance and\npower (Dunkle et al., 2004; Harrison, Xaba, &Kunene,\n2001), our interviews highlighted a strong female\nresistance to condom use. Many women spoke of their\nunwillingness to use condoms due to their need for a\nsense of intimacy and trust with their partners, and\nbecause condoms reduced the pleasure of sex.\nThe third factor potentially intervening between\ntechnical AIDS-related knowledge and behaviour\nchange was competing knowledge about HIV\/AIDS,\nespecially the view HIV\/AIDS sufferers had been\n\u2018\u2018bewitched\u2019\u2019 by jealous others. This led many to\nconclude thatHIV\/AIDSwas unavoidable by individual\nprecautions. Technical knowledge often contradicted\nstrongly held local myths, e.g., \u2018\u2018If a man has a healthy\nfive-year-old son, this means he is not HIV positive\u2019\u2019.\nLow levels of literacy may also have undermined\nthe effectiveness of HIV\/AIDS messages. The concept\nof \u2018\u2018using information\u2019\u2019 to influence one\u2019s behaviour\nseemed very foreign to many people. The concept of\n\u2018\u2018having and applying knowledge\u2019\u2019 was not familiar to\nmany with little or no formal education. The idea of\nseparating the message from the medium was often\nalso unfamiliar. People often said that peer education\nmessages could not be believed, since most of the peer\neducators had died:\nThe ladies (sex workers) that were conducting peer\neducation were the first to die. That is when we\nrealised that peer education was not effective, be-\ncause they were the first to die. (Women\u2019s secretary\nfor political party, 42)\nIn such a conservative community, the concept of\nbehaviour change itself was often greeted with suspi-\ncion. People often expressed strong and negative views\nabout change of any sort. Thus, for example, many\ninformants spoke disapprovingly of young people who\nadopted western lifestyles and \u2018\u2018forgot their own\nculture\u2019\u2019. Such young people were varyingly referred\nto as \u2018\u2018a shock\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018an irritation\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018a nuisance\u2019\u2019.\nOthers spoke disapprovingly of the way in which their\nbehaviour served to dilute a valued African identity:\nPeople from nowadays are wearing trousers, and\nthese were never meant for women. As Africans let us\ndress as Africans, rather than copying western\nculture. (Methodist pastor, man, 32)\nMany people appeared to have a strong gut-level\nresistance to change. Our case study gave the\nimpression of a conservative semi-rural setting where\ninnovation was often resisted:\nMarried people don\u2019t use condoms because they are\nnot used to them. (Home-based club, elderly women,\nfocus group)\nI have never used condoms because I was not\nbrought up knowing about them. (Garden coopera-\ntive, mixed focus group)\nSocial spaces for dialogue about HIV\/AIDS\nWe have referred to the importance of social spaces\nwhere people can discuss HIV\/AIDS information,\ndebating doubts they might have about its relevance\nor accuracy, and collectively negotiating ways it\n1664 M. Nhamo et al.\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:2\n7 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nmight be put into action in their own lives. Our study\nsuggested that many (though certainly not all) com-\nmunity members had few opportunities to engage in\nfrank discussion of HIV\/AIDS with liked and trusted\npeers. Stigma and denial were high, as was the local\ntendency to refer to people with AIDS in veiled terms\nsuch as \u2018\u2018a person who is dying\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018someone who\nsuffers from the disease of nowadays\u2019\u2019.\nHowever, in our research setting, when given space\nto talk about HIV\/AIDS to a sympathetic listener,\ninterview participants took this opportunity and\nexpressed great appreciation for it at the end of the\ninterview. Despite the fact that the interviewer ex-\nplicitly gave no information about HIV\/AIDS at all\nduring the interviews, many informants later thanked\nher for the opportunity to participate in the interview,\nsaying they had learned a lot from participating. From\nthe researchers\u2019 perspective, rather than transmitting\nfactual knowledge to interview participants, the inter-\nview setting had provided people with social spaces to\ntalk about their doubts, uncertainties and experiences\nof HIV\/AIDS in their own lives \u0003 a rare opportunity.\nThus, for example, a sex worker said she had\n\u2018\u2018gained a lot of knowledge\u2019\u2019 from the interview, and\nthat this had given her the confidence to think of\ngoing for voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for\nHIV\/AIDS. An Apostolic Minister began the inter-\nview by dissociating himself from HIV\/AIDS, saying\n\u2018\u2018it\u2019s not necessary for somebody like me to talk about\nHIV\/AIDS\u2019\u2019. However, after the interview he said the\nexperience had helped him realise it was important to\ndiscuss HIV\/AIDS, and he asked the interviewer if\nshe had any books on the topic to lend him. The\nsoccer club coordinator (a young man) said:\nIn this interview I have learned a lot about AIDS that\nI was not aware of. I have also realised how many\nmyths there are in the community, for example, how\nwrong we are to think we can\u2019t catch HIV, just\nbecause we stay in a rural area.\nOnce again, this information had not been volun-\nteered during the interview. Rather he had used the\ninterview as a \u2018\u2018social space\u2019\u2019 to start processing the\nvarious pieces of knowledge he had gained from\nvarious sources in his daily life, but never been able to\napply to his own life through a lack of opportunity\nto process and discuss information in a safe and\nsympathetic context.\nPeople repeatedly spoke of stigma as a key\nobstacle to effective HIV\/AIDS management. Yet\nthere was an interesting contradiction here. At the\npersonal level most people appeared to have been\nkind and supportive to individuals with HIV\/AIDS.\nFamily members offered care, neighbours visited with\nkindness and support. Church members prayed for\nthe sick. Most people contributed to funeral expenses,\na long-standing local custom. However, at the public\nlevel people went to great pains to publicise their\ndisapproval of people living with AIDS:\nI don\u2019t want to lie to you, friends abandon their peers\nwho get HIV. We had a friend who was dying, he\nused to be promiscuous, we used to laugh at him\nsaying he was now \u2018\u2018going to the man with the long\nbeard\u2019\u2019. (Apostolic church leader, male, 63)\nBehind her back my mother\u2019s friends laugh at her,\nsaying they knew she\u2019d come to this. (Carer of\nmother living with HIV\/AIDS)\nPeople with HIV are immoral and they are heathens,\nthese people have been promiscuous, therefore it is\nonly right and proper that the health clinics treat\nthem badly. (Church elder, male, 55)\nActs of kindness were often committed in secret,\nbehind the socially desirable mask of public anti-\nAIDS talk, or under the guise of helping \u2018\u2018the sick\u2019\u2019\nrather than naming AIDS as the issue. Interviews\nsuggested there was no context in which individual\nacts of caring or assistance could add up to a more\npowerful collective response, given their highly secre-\ntive and individual nature.\nMany people may have lacked opportunities for\nthe type of \u2018\u2018critical dialogue\u2019\u2019 that Freire (1970, 1973)\nsays is so important for positive individual and social\nchange.\nPeople should be forced to listen to HIV\/AIDS\neducation. Because it is to their advantage. (Soccer\nclub leader, male, 31)\nChiefs and nurses must give people instructions,\neducation must come from people we look up to,\nwho should stipulate strict regulations. (Female\ncaregiver to PLWHA, 19)\nPeoples\u2019 references to AIDS education were often\ncouched in the genre of instruction, with the targets of\ninformation being conceptualised as passive listeners\nrather than active interactants.\nAppreciation of local strengths and resources\nThe likelihood of people contributing to HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement depends strongly on them believing they\nhave strengths and resources to equip them to do so\n(Campbell, Foulis, Maimane, & Sibiya, 2005). Our\ncase study suggested that the greatest AIDS resource\nin the community was women\u2019s unpaid \u0003 and largely\nunrecognised \u0003 work in giving emotional and prac-\ntical support to PLWHA. Yet women repeatedly said\nAIDS Care 1665\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:2\n7 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nthat they were not respected, consulted or represented\nin local community affairs:\nMen are regarded as the leaders. Us women\u2019s ideas\nare disregarded, even when they are brilliant. (Home-\nbased care leader, woman, 52)\nWhen women did exercise leadership it tended to be\nin gender-specific spheres of activity, such as women\u2019s\nchurch groups and in the women\u2019s section of the\nleading political party.\nMen were generally not spoken of as a great\ncommunity resource:\nMen just loiter around the place, they don\u2019t do a\nthing that is beneficial. They just come home without\neven carrying a parcel. They are the stresses in our\nlives. (Leader of women\u2019s savings club)\nYoung people also tended to be discounted as a\npositive community resource, often described as\n\u2018\u2018lazy\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018incompetent\u2019\u2019. In turn, young people\nsaid adult domination stifled any attempts they made\nto show initiative:\nWe can\u2019t do anything because we don\u2019t have the\nresources and we always have to appoint older people\nto lead us because we are regarded as minors. This\nhas demoralised a lot of young people. (Political\nyouth group, focus group)\nWe approached our councillor to help us raise some\nfunds for a soccer ball. He said he would look into it,\nbut nothing happened. We couldn\u2019t go back and ask\nagain, because that would have seemed disrespectful.\n(Soccer club leader, man, 31)\nOwnership of the problem of HIV\/AIDS\nTo what extent do Kumahuswa residents think\nthey have a role in addressing HIV\/AIDS? To\nwhat extent do they have ideas for actions they\nmight take as individuals, in groups, or through\nbuilding links with outsiders? Many of our infor-\nmants had little sense of ownership of the problem,\nwith repeated reference to the need for outsiders to\ncome and address it:\nCome and educate children about their sexual rights,\nwe have too many cases of child abuse. (Garden\ncooperative, mixed focus group)\nPeople take it as stigma if you use gloves while you\nare nursing them, please come back and educate\nthem. (Village health worker, woman, 39)\nYou people from AIDS organisations should come\nhere and talk to our children. Perhaps if you talk to\nthem they will be scared of AIDS. (Bee-keeping\ncollective, mixed focus group)\nI suggest you call a workshop for men to talk to them\nabout what we are saying, perhaps if you talk to\nthem, they will realise the importance of condom use.\n(Women\u2019s savings club, focus group)\nWe are stressed. These are the problems we encoun-\nter, can you please help us? We don\u2019t know what to\ndo. (Women\u2019s church group, focus group)\nThere were many local organisations and clubs in\nKumahuswa. These included a soccer club, a savings\nclub, a traditional dance group, a garden cooperative,\na political youth club, an Apostolic women\u2019s group, a\nbee-keeping society and a burial society. There was\nalso a government sponsored Ward AIDS Action\nCommittee (WAAC) dispensing government funding\nfor local AIDS activities, and a home-based care club.\nThe WAAC focused on providing food parcels\nand school fees for AIDS orphans. People repeatedly\nstressed the importance of this assistance. However,\ngiven the scale of the problem, there would always be\na need for further resources. In relation to our interest\nin AIDS competence, this qualified as welfare work\nrather than social development (\u2018\u2018providing fish\nrather than fishing rods\u2019\u2019).\nGenerally people were positive about the benefits\nof groups. For example, interviewees repeatedly said\n\u2018\u2018soccer keeps young people out of trouble\u2019\u2019, and that\nsoccer club members were less likely to be HIV-\npositive than non-members. People talked about the\nhelp and comfort they derived from the church, the\nway it instilled empowering moral discipline in\nwomen, and the way in which church members\nvisited the sick. People also spoke about the burial\nsociety as a beneficial support group, paying for\nmembers\u2019 funerals and also giving them loans whilst\nthey were alive. The bee-keeping club was also seen\nas very effective \u0003 with members having been trained\nby an NGO, and now using these skills to generate\nincome through selling honey. Moser (1998) reminds\nus that even resource-poor communities have \u2018\u2018port-\nfolio\u2019s of non-material assets\u2019\u2019. In Kumahuswa, a\nnumber of positive community networks served as\nkey social resources providing various forms of\nemotional, practical and material support to mem-\nbers. However, factors such as stigma and lack of\nAIDS-related agency may often have stood in the\nway of these networks serving as AIDS-specific\nresources.\nBridging social capital\nThis final component of AIDS competence relates to\nempowering links with outside organisations capable\nof helping local people to respond more effectively to\nHIV\/AIDS. The wider context of our research is an\n1666 M.

Many viewed AIDS as the responsibility of\noutside agencies, with little sense that local people\nmight also have a contribution to make to HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement. This representation of AIDS manage-\nment as centred around instructions and outsiders is\ndirectly contradictory to best practice. Our interviews\nsuggested that earlier well-intentioned HIV-preven-\ntion and AIDS-care efforts (prior to our HIV-\nprevention programme of interest) may sometimes\nhave had less than optimal success in promoting local\nownership and leadership of prevention and care\nprogrammes. Informants referred to previous inter-\nventions that seemed to have focused more on\nenrolling community members to deliver unpaid\nservices to programmes, than building their capacity\nto make a significant contribution to programme\ndesign, leadership or management.\nWe illustrate this point with a discussion of a\nlong-standing local home-based care club (not linked\nto our intervention of interest), chaired by Mrs K, an\nenergetic middle-aged woman with a deep calling to\nserve her community. She said she had been nomi-\nnated by a local councillor to liaise with an inter-\nnationally funded NGO around home-based care\ndelivery. The NGO trained Mrs K and six other\nwomen (all volunteers) in home nursing skills and\ninitially provided food parcels and blankets for\ndistribution to AIDS-affected families. They met\nfortnightly to timetable their work and encourage\neach other to continue this gruelling work.\nAt the time of our interviews, Mrs K and her club\npeers were still working hard in delivering home\nnursing assistance \u0003 but she no longer had any contact\nwith the NGO. In the course of a long interview it\nbecame clear that although group members worked\nwith dedication and commitment, they knew nothing\nabout the context of the work, the nature of the NGO\nor the origin of the blankets, and had certainly never\nbeen consulted about any aspect of it:\nThey no longer bring the blankets and the food\nparcels. I am not sure why . . . I am not sure who\ninitiated this group . . .Our club members don\u2019t net-\nwork with anyone else besides each other . . .We have\nrun out of gloves and need a refresher course. . . . I am\nnot sure of the future plans of this group because I\nam not part of the management. (Home-based club\nchair, woman, 52)\nThere is a growing critique of programmes which\ninterpret \u2018\u2018community participation\u2019\u2019 as the use of\nlocal community members to deliver unpaid welfare\nservices according to an externally imposed agenda,\nwithout involving participants in wider decisions\nabout project design and management (or at the\nvery least making sure that they are well-informed\nabout such matters) (Campbell, 2003). In so doing,\nthey may miss vital opportunities to build grassroots\ncapacity in project design, management and decision-\nmaking, which could constitute vital capacity if\/when\nthe NGO withdrew from the community.\nConclusion\nWe have reported on the wider context into which an\nHIV-prevention programme was inserted in a rural\nZimbabwean community. We have not sought to\nmake any comment on the intervention itself. Rather\nwe have sought to cast our net more widely to\nexamine broader social dynamics, in the interests of\nadvancing debate about ways in which pre-existing\nlocal dynamics may serve to facilitate or hinder\nprogramme efforts in particular settings. The key\naim of HIV-prevention programmes is to bring about\nsexual behaviour change: increased condom use,\ndelayed sexual debut, fewer sexual partners and so\non. However, social psychologists have repeatedly\npointed out that the likelihood of behaviour change is\ninfluenced not only by the information transmitted by\nhealth promotion programmes and the techniques\nthat they use, but also by pre-existing levels of\nperceived self-efficacy \u0003 confidence in one\u2019s ability\nto change one\u2019s behaviour \u0003 amongst members of\nprogramme\u2019s target groupings (Bandura, 1995). This\ninsight is echoed in the concept of \u2018\u2018empowerment\u2019\u2019\nwhich forms the cornerstone of community psychol-\nogy (Nelson & Prilleltensky, 2005; Wallerstein, 1992)\nand social development (Parpart, Rai, & Staudt,\n2002).\nWe have used the concept of AIDS competence as\na framework for highlighting factors which might\nhave undermined the sense of HIV\/AIDS-related\nempowerment in Kumahuswa. People had relatively\nhigh levels of HIV\/AIDS-related knowledge, but\ngender, poverty and low levels of literacy might\nhave undermined the perceived relevance of this\nknowledge to their own lives. Lack of opportunities\nfor dialogue in the social milieu beyond the interven-\ntion may have meant people had few opportunities\nfor translating factual knowledge into action plans, or\nfor sharing their hidden individual experiences of\nHIV\/AIDS-related family members or friends in\norder to feed these individual experiences into a wider\nAIDS Care 1667\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:2\n7 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nsocial acknowledgement of the extent of the problem\nin Kumahuswa. The initiative and energy of women\nand young people, potentially a vital resource for an\neffective community response to AIDS were hindered\nby the dominance of adult males. Many people\nresponded to HIV\/AIDS in a passive and fatalistic\nway, waiting for outsiders to tackle the problem. This\npassivity may have been exacerbated by earlier\nexperiences of HIV\/AIDS-related NGOs, who may\nhave used local people to deliver unpaid community\nservices without building their capacity to lead more\neffective community responses to AIDS and indeed\nother future health threats.\nHowever, in many respects our snapshot of\nKumahuswa social relations was not an overwhel-\nmingly bleak one. There were many potential\nstrengths and resources in the community: people\ndid have high levels of HIV\/AIDS-related knowledge,\ndespite the existence of potential obstacles to action-\ning this. Beneath high levels of public denial of HIV\/\nAIDS, there were huge reservoirs of support and\nkindness towards AIDS-affected friends and family\nmembers, albeit often offered clandestinely in condi-\ntions of stigma. The community included many well-\nnetworked community groups, with many local clubs\nand organisations that might have formed the spring-\nboard for a more empowered and positive attitude to\nHIV\/AIDS.\nIn preparing to implement programmes, there is\nan urgent need for HIV\/AIDS programmers to\ndevelop understandings of the way in which the\npre-existing social dynamics of their target commu-\nnities might facilitate or hinder their efforts. Much\nremains to be learned about how potential obstacles\ncan be identified and anticipated by interventions,\nand we believe the concept of \u2018\u2018the AIDS competent\ncommunity\u2019\u2019 provides a useful conceptual tool for\nguiding such investigations. Much also remains to be\nlearned about identifying and mobilising the social\nassets that exist, even in conditions of great poverty\nand gender inequality. To date the efforts of many\nprogrammes have focused on technical details of\nprogramme design, implementation\/management and\nevaluation. There is an urgent need to cast the\nspotlight more broadly to look at wider dimensions\nof pre-existing AIDS competence in target commu-\nnities, in the interests of planning how best to\noptimise \u2018\u2018community readiness\u2019\u2019 to derive optimal\nbenefit from interventions in highly marginalised\nsettings.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Andy Gibbs for assistance in preparing\nthe manuscript and for conducting background research; to\nMorten Skovdal for editorial support; and to the Wellcome\nTrust for providing funding for the study.\nReferences\nBandura, A.
