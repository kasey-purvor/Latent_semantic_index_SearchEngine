Groundwater pollution from \ndiffuse sources is not only a serious environmental issue but also an economic and human \nhealth problem. For example, nitrate groundwater pollution could cause health problems such \nas \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d (USDA, 1991; Matson et al., 1997), and cancer risks (Rademaher et \nal., 1992; Yang et al. 2007), and high drinking water treatment costs (Pretty et al., 2000).  \nOnce groundwater is contaminated, it is very costly to clean-up and may take a long \ntime to recover. Moreover, spatial variability and data constraints preclude monitoring of all \nwaters and make remediation activities expensive and often impractical (Babiker et al., 2005). \n   \n2 \nTherefore, the measures for groundwater pollution prevention before pollution occurs \ncontribute to reducing contaminants in the source water, and are more feasible and effective \nthan remedial measures (Koo & O\u2019Connell, 2006). In agricultural diffuse groundwater \npollution (ADGWP), it is difficult to tell exactly where the pollutants come from. Thus, it is \ndifficult to determine the contribution of diffuse sources to water pollution at the regional \nscale (Defra, 2002a). ADGWP should be prevented at the catchment or watershed scale. \nGroundwater vulnerability assessment, which is capable of delineating zones that are more \nsusceptible to pollutants from diffuse agricultural sources at the catchment scale, is important \nfor guiding the prevention activities for ADGWP.   \nGroundwater vulnerability means the possibility of percolation and diffusion of \ncontaminants from the ground surface into the groundwater system (Vrba & Zoporozec, 1994; \nPalmer et al., 1995). Many groundwater vulnerability studies have been carried out \nworldwide (Gogu et al., 2000; Bekesi & McConchie, 2002; Daly et al., 2002; Dixon et al., \n2002; Gogu et al., 2003; Gemitzi et al., 2006; Yang & Wang, 2010). To date there are four \nmain types of method for groundwater vulnerability assessment (Worrall & Besien, 2005; \nWang & Yang, 2008): (a) modelling approaches using physical-process-based simulation \nmodels to estimate approximately the contaminant transport (Barbash & Resek, 1996; \nThapinta & Hudak, 2003); (b) observation-based methods generating groundwater \nvulnerability maps based on observed contaminants; (c) statistical methods to correlate spatial \nvariables with the actual occurrence of pollutants in groundwater (Babiker et al., 2005); and \n(d) index methods combining the factors controlling the pollutant transport from the ground \nsurface into the saturated zone and resulting in spatially-distributed vulnerability indices. \nWith index methods, there is a major drawback in the subjectivity in the factor weighting and \nassignment of numerical values. However, index methods do have the following advantages: \n(a) information on factors such as rainfall and depth to groundwater may be available over \nlarge areas, which makes them suitable for regional scale assessments (Thapinta and Hudak, \n2003); and (b) they are easy to understand and apply. \nThe DRASTIC method, an index method, was developed by the US Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) (Aller et al., 1987). Although DRASTIC is a method using \nsubjective weighting and assignment of numerical values to factors, these factors and their \nweighting values, which were selected and calculated based on the knowledge and \nunderstanding of groundwater pollution by a group of groundwater pollution experts, can well \nreflect the key mechanisms of the groundwater pollution pathways. Therefore, the DRASTIC \nmethod has been widely used for groundwater vulnerability (Worrall & Kolpin, 2004; \nBabiker et al., 2005). The effectiveness of DRASTIC has met with mixed success (Rupert, \n2001).  \nWithin the UK context, many groundwater pollution potential studies have been \ncarried out at the national or regional scale (Wang & Yang, 2008). These studies are useful in \nfinding the priority for groundwater pollution protection work, but have limitations in guiding \nprevention practices for ADGWP at the catchment scale. For example, most of Northern \nIreland should be designated as nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZ), according to the new \ndemands of the European Commission (Jordan & Smith, 2005). This could hardly guide the \nprevention practices of ADGWP that should be carried out at the catchment scale. In addition, \nthe index methods used in the UK for groundwater vulnerability assessment consider only a \nfew factors (such as overlying soil cover, the presence and nature of the drift, the nature of \nstrata, and the thickness of the unsaturated zone). This could lead to high uncertainty in the \nresult (Palmer et al., 1995; Palmer & Lewis, 1998; Giupponi & Vladimirova, 2006). \nTherefore, it is necessary to find a feasible approach for vulnerability assessment of \ngroundwater pollution at the catchment scale that is useful for the prevention of ADGWP in \nthe water resources management of the Northern Ireland. \nThis study aims at: (a) evaluating the DRASTIC method for assessing groundwater \npollution vulnerability in a catchment dominated by agricultural land use \u2013 taking the Upper \nBann catchment of Northern Ireland as an example; and (b) overlaying land-use data on \ngroundwater vulnerability maps to represent groundwater pollution risk in the study area. \n \n   \n3 \nSTUDY AREA \nThe Upper Bann catchment, in Northern Ireland (NI), was used as a case study area in this \nstudy (Fig. 1). Northern Ireland is a rural and agricultural province; 66% of the population \nlives in Belfast, the second largest city in Ireland. The towns of Craigavon, Lurgan and \nPortadown combined in the 1960s as part of the UK \u201cNew Town\u201d development scheme, to \nform one large continuous urban sprawl that covers an area of 260 km2 in the Upper Bann \ncatchment, with a population of approximately 80 000 inhabitants today. The agri-food \nindustry, with total processed sales worth \u00a32 billion, plays a vital role in the NI economy. \nUpland areas, including the Mourne Mountains, offer numerous catchments suitable for the \ncollection and storage of surface water. These gathering grounds are complemented by Lough \nNeagh (388 km2, at about 15 m AOD), the largest inland freshwater lake in the British Isles, \nfor public supply throughout the low-lying land (Robins, 1996).   \nNorthern Ireland offers the most compact and diverse range of solid geology, \nQuaternary deposits and soil types anywhere in Europe. Permian and Triassic sandstones are \nthe most important aquifers in NI. The widespread occurrence of relatively poor aquifers has \npromoted the development of groundwater in the Quaternary deposits (most notably the \nGlarryford sand and gravel aquifer). The rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas and groundwater of NI \nare important natural resources for drinking water, agriculture, industry and fisheries, and for \namenity and recreational use. In NI, surface water is the dominant source of public water \nsupply, while groundwater is estimated to provide only 8% of the total. However, \ngroundwater still has an important role to play because of its contribution to baseflow of \nsurface water, especially in times of low flow. Therefore, both surface water and groundwater \nare vital to social and economic development throughout the rural community. However, \nsome human activities can threaten water quality. For example, pollutants from point or \ndiffuse sources, especially compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, resulted in eutrophication \nin Lough Neagh and other surface water bodies in NI. The results of a number of lake surveys \ncarried out between 1988 and 1994 indicated that some 63% of NI lakes were either eutrophic \nor hypertrophic.  \n \n \nLough Neagh \nNorthern \nIreland \nUpper Bann Catchment  \nFig. 1 The location of the Upper Bann catchment in Northern Ireland. \n \n \nThe Upper Bann catchment study area lies in the southeast of NI and the upper River \nBann is the largest river supplying Lough Neagh. The study area has a mean annual rainfall of \n995 mm and a mean annual potential evapotranspiration of 516 mm. The topography gently \nundulates throughout the area, rising from 11 m at Lough Neagh to a maximum of 672 m in \nthe Mourne Mountains. The Upper Bann is a complex rural catchment with a wide range of \nland uses, including fruit growing, livestock farming, arable farming, and urbanization. The \ndominant soil type is \u201cgleyed\u201d soil that is predominantly comprised of till and clay with \n   \n4 \npockets of peat and alluvial deposits of sand, silt and gravel, and their dominant soil parent \nmaterials are drifts and glacial tills derived from basalts, Silurian shales and carboniferous \nrocks (Cruickshank, 1997). The groundwater table depth rarely exceeds 5 m in the study area. \nMore details of the catchment are provided by Wang & Yang (2008). \n \n \nMETHODS  \nThe DRASTIC approach \nThe DRASTIC approach, an index method, provides a numerical ranking composite \ndescription of all the major geological and hydrological factors that affect and control \ngroundwater movement into, through, and out across the vertical profiles of an area. Within \nthe intrinsic meaning of groundwater pollution vulnerability, DRASTIC has seven factors:  \n(1) Depth to water, D \u2013 the depth to the aquifer from the ground surface, determines the \nmedium depth through which pollutants travel before reaching the aquifer.  \n(2) Net recharge, R \u2013 the amount of water that penetrates the ground surface and reaches the \nwater table, acts as a principle vehicle for transporting pollutants to the water table \nthrough the leaching process.  \n(3) Aquifer, A \u2013 refers to the saturated zone material properties and controls the pollutant \npermeability and attenuation processes.  \n(4) Soil media, S \u2013 the uppermost weathered portion of the unsaturated zone characterised by \nsignificant biological activity, controls the amount of recharge that can infiltrate \ndownward.  \n(5) Topography, T \u2013 the slope of the land surface, dictates the likelihood that runoff will \nremain on the surface to allow contaminant percolation to the saturated zone.  \n(6) Impact of vadose zone, I \u2013 represents the type of material in the zone above the water \ntable and below the typical soil horizon, which controls the passage and attenuation of \nthe contaminated material to the saturated zone. \n(7) Hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, C \u2013 indicates the ability of the aquifer to transmit \nwater, and hence determines the rate of the flow of contaminant material within the \ngroundwater system.  \nSince the importance of these factors in groundwater pollution processes are \ndifferent, each factor was assigned a relative weight, ranging from 1 to 5, determined using a \nDelphi approach, which quantifies the opinions from single and multiple experts. The most \nsignificant factor has a weight of 5 and the least significant one has a weight of 1.  \n The involvement of multi-sphere factors, i.e. the hydrosphere, atmosphere and geosphere, \nmakes the ADGWP vulnerability assessment an inherently geographical activity requiring the \nhandling of multiple forms of spatial data. With its advantages for spatial data management, \nanalysis and visualisation, ArcGIS 9.0 was adopted for the data preparation, and the \nmathematic calculation of the raster data layers in the DRASTIC method. The definition of \nthe DRASTIC index in GIS was adapted (equation 1) from the original definition of Aller et \nal. (1987): \n \niriwiriwiriwiriwiriwiriwiriwi CCIITTSSAARRDD ++++++=DVI           (1) \n \nwhere DVI represents the DRASTIC vulnerability index; the subscript i is the ith cell in the \nGIS raster data structure; D, R, A, S, T, I and C are the seven factors in DRASTIC; the \nsubscripts r and w are the numerical ratings (to be calculated) and weightings of the seven \nfactors, respectively. \n The assumptions of DRASTIC include:  \n(1) the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface;  \n(2) the contaminant is flushed into the ground water by precipitation;  \n(3) the contaminant is soluble; and \n(4) the area assessed using DRASTIC is  0.4 km2 or larger (Aller et al., 1987).  \n In ADGWP, the soluble pollutants from the agricultural land use percolate into \n   \n5 \ngroundwater with net recharge water. The weights of D, R, A, S, T, I and C in equation (1) are \n5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 and 3, respectively, for general pollutant, while they are 5, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4 and 2 for \npesticide groundwater pollution vulnerability calculation. According to the DRASTIC \nmanual, the numerical rating rules, defined in DRASTIC using the Delphi approach, cannot \nbe changed. Within DRASTIC, each factor has its ranges or significant media types for \nassigning its rating value that represents its relative significance in the impact on groundwater \npollution potential. The preparation and analysis of data and the implementation of the \nDRASTIC method were performed using ArcGIS. \n \nParameter  maps in GIS \nPrior to application of the DRASTIC model, a GIS database was set up. Borehole, drift and \nsolid geology data were provided by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI); \nmeteorological data were from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC); the land cover \ndata were provided by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH); the soil data were \nacquired from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) of Northern \nIreland; and the DEM data were obtained from the Environmental Heritage Service (EHS). In \norder to facilitate the application of DRASTIC, all the DRASTIC factor data were converted \ninto a raster data format in the ArcGIS platform with a resolution of 50 m \u00d7 50 m. The rating \nof the seven factors in DRASTIC was based on the standards set in the DRASTIC manual. \n \nDepth to water  \nThe data for \u201cdepth to water\u201d in the study area were obtained from 660 borehole logs \ncontaining the first water strike information. These point data were interpolated to a \ncontinuous raster layer representing the water table surface. A deeper water table implies less \nchance for contamination to occur because of the longer transport time, greater opportunity \nfor chemical reaction and the occurrence of pollutant attenuation (Aller et al., 1987). In the \nstudy area, the depth of water table below ground is shallow, with an average value of 2.5m, \nand three rating values were calculated, i.e. 7 (4.6\u20139.1m), 9 (1.5\u20134.6m) and 10 (0\u20131.5m). In \nDRASTIC, the higher ratings imply greater groundwater pollution potential and vice versa.  \n \nNet recharge \nNet recharge in the DRASTIC method is the amount of precipitation minus surface runoff and \nevapotranspiration. The mean precipitation and evapotranspiration of 10 years from 1990 to \n2000 were interpolated from the meteorological data. Surface runoff data was calculated \nadopting the US Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) curve number (CN) \nmethod (NRCS, 2004). Both land cover and soil properties influence the process of runoff \ngeneration. Land covers in the study area were reclassified into brush, woods, row crop, \npasture, fallow, water and urban area, according to the NRCS CN method. Since this study \nwas focusing on the soluble pollutants from diffuse agricultural sources, the urban areas were \nregarded as impervious surface. Based on the soil properties, soil in the study area was \nclassified into four groups (A, B, C and D) with A having low runoff potential and D having \nhigh runoff potential. The curve number in each cell of the area was determined using the \nland use and soil re-classification data. In this method, the curve number of the impervious \nland and water body were assigned a value of 98. The runoff value in each cell of the study \narea was calculated using:  \n \n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u00d7+\n=\n+\n\u2212\n=\n0394.010\n1000CN\n8.0\n)2.0( 2\nS\nSP\nSPQ\n       aIP >                              (2) \nwhere Q is the depth of runoff, P the depth of rainfall, and Ia the initial abstraction, all in mm. \nIa consists mainly of interception, infiltration during the early parts of storm and surface \ndepression storage. S is the maximum potential retention in mm; the relationship between Ia \nand S is expressed as Ia = 0.2S (NRCS, 2004). CN is the curve number showing graphically \nthe relationship between rainfall and runoff. \n   \n6 \n With the average value of 147.3 mm, the net recharge GIS raster layer for the area was \nclassified into five ranges and assigned rating values of 1 (0\u201350.8 mm), 3 (50.8\u2013101.6 mm), 6 \n(101.6\u2013177.8 mm), 8 (177.8\u2013254 mm) and 9 (>254 mm). Higher net recharge rating values \nmean higher recharge rates and higher groundwater pollution potential. \n \nAquifer  media \nConsolidated and unconsolidated rock may serve as an aquifer. In general, the larger the grain \nsize or the more fractures and openings within the aquifer, the higher the permeability and the \nlower the attenuation capacity the aquifer media have. Aquifer media information for the \nstudy area was obtained from drift geology maps and previous hydrogeological \ninvestigations. The study area is covered in a thick layer of glacial drift (5\u201320 m) with very \nfew outcrops of bedrock left exposed. Overlying these are recent peat and alluvial deposits; \nthe latter may vary from gravels to laminated clays (Wang & Yang, 2008). Aquifer media in \nthe study area consist of glacial till, peat, sand and gravel, alluvium (sand and silt) and \noutcrop rock in exposure. The glacial till is unconsolidated to semi-consolidated mixtures of \ngravel, sand, silt and clay-size particles that are poorly sorted and stratified. The low \npermeability glacial till was assigned a rating value 5. The peat, which consists of un-\ndecomposed to partially decomposed plant material that is fresh enough to be identified and is \nrelatively permeable but with a high contaminant attenuation, was assigned a rating value 4. \nSand and gravel were given a rating value 8 because of their high permeability. Alluvium, \nmainly finer-grained and \u201cdirtier\u201d sands, was given a rating value 6. Information regarding \nthe outcropping rocks was obtained from the solid geology map. In the study area, the outcrop \nrocks include basalt (dolerite), igneous rock (felsite, granite, granodiorite), shale (mudstone) \nand sandstone, which were assigned rating values of 9, 3, 2 and 6, respectively, according to \nthe definitions in DRASTIC. A higher aquifer media rating value means higher permeability, \nlower attenuation capacity of the aquifer media and higher groundwater pollution potential. \n \nSoil media \nSoil media information was gathered from the Northern Ireland soils database (DARD, 1997). \nIn general, the less the clay shrinks and swells and the smaller the grain size, the less the \npollution potential. Based on the sand, silt and clay content of each soil type, quantified by \nCruickshank (1997), soils in the study area were re-classified using the British Soil \nClassification Standard BS3882. The quantity of organic material present in the soil may also \nbe an important factor in the attenuation of pesticides. Table 1 shows the soil types, their \ncomposition, soil media re-classification and each soil type rating for the study area. Urban \nareas were regarded as impervious surface by assigning rating value 1. Water bodies, such as \nlakes, wet land and ponds, were treated as thin or absent soil by assigning a rating value of 10 \n\u2013 the highest groundwater pollution potential. \n \nTable 1 Soils properties and their DRASTIC rating values (modified from Wang & Yang, \n2008). \nSoil media \nclassification Sand ( %) Silt ( %) Clay ( %) Soil rating \nLoam 41.7~47.8 34.6~39.7 15.7~23.6 5 \nSandy loam 46.3~61.65 22.6~38.8 12.6~15.7 6 \nLoam 41.7~47.8 34.6~39.7 15.7~23.6 5 \nSandy loam 63.4~80.9 15.6~25.7 2.8~10.3 6 \nSandy loam 49.8~65.8 20.4~26.4 13.8~23.8 6 \nLoam 29.7~50.8 38.6~42.4 14.6~27.9 5 \nLoam 29.7~50.8 38.6~42.4 14.6~27.9 5 \nSandy clay loam 45.4~48.9 24.2~26.6 26.9~28.8 4 \nSandy loam 61.5~68.3 18.8~22.5 10.8~15.5 6 \nLoam 34.5~38.9 38.8~42.1 20.5~25.7 5 \nSandy loam 61.2~67.5 17.4~20.1 12.5~19.6 6 \n   \n7 \nLoam 38.3~40.5 41.2~44.1 17.6~18.3 5 \nClay loam 27.2~39.2 33.1~35.1 27.5~37.5 3 \nClay loam 34.7~52.7 28.1~30.5 19.2~35.2 3 \nLoam 35.8~51.5 31.9~43.1 16.2~21.1 5 \nLoam 41.0~55.7 25.4~36.7 18.9~22.9 5 \nClay loam 25.2~32.7 43.4~43.8 23.4~31.4 3 \nSilt Loam 7.5~21.9 70.0~77.6 0.5~22.5 4 \nClay loam 25.2~32.8 43.4~43.8 23.4~31.4 3 \nLoamy sand 83.3 13 3.8 9 \nSandy loam 52.7~61.5 36.0~36.4 2.5~10.9 6 \nSandy loam 52.7~61.5 36.0~36.5 2.5~10.10 6 \n \nTopography \nSlopes, which provide a greater opportunity for pollutants to infiltrate, will be associated with \nhigher groundwater pollution potential. Topography also controls the gradient and direction \nof flow. Typically, steeper slopes signify higher groundwater velocity. Slope in the study area \nwas derived from DEM data in ArcGIS, and then was divided into ranges and assigned \nratings from 1 to 10 according to the DRASTIC rating standard. It is worth noting that the \nranges of \u201cpercent slope\u201d described in the DRASTIC model are recommended to be \nconverted to degree slope when applying DRASTIC in GIS. Steep areas were assigned low \nrating values because they increase the runoff washing out contaminants, whilst flat areas, \nslow down the runoff and allow more time for percolation, were given high rating values.  \n \nImpact of vadose zone media \nThe media type determines the process of biodegradation, neutralisation, mechanical \nfiltration, chemical reaction, volatilisation and dispersion in the vadose zone. Vadose zone \nmedia identification and classification were based on the soil map, drift geology map, \nborehole data and water table depth information. Rocks (shale, basalt, igneous, shale and \nsandstone) and drifts (glacial till and gravel) were found in the study area. The rating for the \nthin gravel was assigned 10 \u2013 the highest pollution potential. The components of the glacial \ntills and their drainage properties vary greatly. With the soil database and the detailed soil \nproperties information, the glacial tills were re-grouped according to their sand contents (7\u2013\n87%). Sandy till is \u201csand and gravel with significant silt and clay\u201d (definition in DRASTIC) \nwith rating value 6; whilst a dense, un-fractured, clayey till (silt\/clay) was assigned rating \nvalue 3. Other types of glacial till were respectively assigned the rating values between 3 and \n6, on the basis of their sand contents. Vadose zone media ratings reflect the grain size, \nsorting, homogeneity and amount of fine material. Higher rating value means higher \ngroundwater pollution potential. \n \nAquifer  hydraulic conductivity \nThe values of aquifer hydraulic conductivity (K) were estimated based on the K ranges \nprovided in the DRASTIC method and validated using values from the literature and pumping \ntests in nearby areas. The K values in the area were assigned rating values of 1 (0.04\u20134.1 \nm\/d), 2 (4.1\u201312.2 m\/d), 6 (28.5\u201341 m\/d), 8 (41\u201382 m\/d), and 10 (>82 m\/d). Higher K ratings \nimply the higher aquifer permeability and higher groundwater pollution potential. \n \n \nRESULTS \nThe DRASTIC factors \nAlthough the DRASTIC index values (see details in Fig. 9 from Wang & Yang, 2008) \nrepresent the overall groundwater vulnerability, the result of each factor is also useful in \nunderstanding the groundwater pollution pathways in a study area. In the \u201cdepth to water\u201d \nrating layer, comparatively high groundwater pollution potential cells with rating values of 9 \nand 10 cover 98% of the study catchment. Cells with value 7 are located in the low-lying area \n   \n8 \nto the middle and northwest of the study catchment. High net recharge ratings of 8 (13% of \nthe total study area) and 9 (21%) can be found in the mountain areas, whereas low net \nrecharge ratings 1 (31%) and 3 (17%) are located in low-lying areas. The undulating drumlin \nareas have a moderate net recharge rating, i.e. 6 (18%). In the aquifer rating result, most parts \nof the area has a rating value 5 (78%) standing for glacial till media for unconfined aquifer. \nAgainst the background of rating 5, the strips of alluvium, sand and silt developed along \nstreams and rivers have comparatively higher groundwater pollution potential with the rating \n6 (11%). Outcrops in mountain areas with rating 2 (1 %) and 3 (3%) have low groundwater \npollution potential. With the dominant soil types of \u201cloam\u201d \u2013 rating 5 (52 %), \u201cclay loam\u201d \u2013 3 \n(16 %) and \u201csandy loam\u201d \u2013 6 (15%), the soil media rating values gradually decrease from \nmountain areas to low-lying areas, except in a small area immediately south of Lough Neagh \nthat is covered by peat and has a higher vulnerability than the basalt and till around it. In the \ntopography rating layer, the steep slope cells with the rating values of 1 (5%) and 3 (10%) are \nlocated in the mountain areas to the southeast, southwest and east of the study area. In \ncontrast, the low-lying area to the northwest of the study area has high ratings of 9 (33%) and \n10 (22%). In addition, the undulating area of the rest of the study has mixed values of 1, 3, 5 \n(30%), 9 and 10. The vadose zone media with the rating value 6 (15%) \u2013 \u201calluvium strata\u201d \u2013 \ndeveloping along streams or rivers on the background of rating 4 (72 %) \u2013 \u201ctill\u201d \u2013 form \ndistinct strips with comparatively high groundwater pollution potential. High rating values 8 \n(1%), 9 (1%) and 10 (2%) can be found in mountain areas. In the K rating layer, most parts of \nthe area have comparatively low aquifer permeability with rating values of 1 (81%) and 2 \n(6%), while cells with rating value 8 (8%) form obvious alluvium strips along streams or \nrivers. \n \nGroundwater pollution vulnerability \nThe groundwater vulnerability for general pollutants and also the groundwater pesticide \nvulnerability were calculated using equation (1). For general pollutants, ten vulnerability \nranks were identified in the study area. Fig. 2 shows \u201chigh\u201d (4.5% of total area) and \n\u201cmoderate\u201d (25.5%) vulnerability zones in the mountain areas to the southeast (Mourne \nMountains), east (Slieve Croob) and southwest (source of River Cusher) due to high rainfall, \nnet recharge and soil permeability. \u201cLow\u201d (73.8%) vulnerability zones can be found in the \nmiddle and northwest of the study area where the covering soil has low permeability. Because \nof the high permeability of alluvium, sand and gravel in the riverbeds, strips along \nstreams\/rivers have comparatively higher vulnerability ranks than their backgrounds. The \ngroundwater pesticide vulnerability map (Fig. 3) has a distribution of rankings similar to Fig. \n2. However, the \u201chigh\u201d (4.7%) and \u201cmoderate\u201d (50.7%) vulnerability zones in Fig. 3 have \nhigher proportions than that of Fig. 2. \n \n \n   \n9 \n \nFig. 2 Groundwater vulnerability for general pollutants in the Upper Bann catchment. \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Groundwater pesticide vulnerability in the Upper Bann catchment. \n \n \n Generally, the high ADGWP risk is associated with arable land having higher fertilizer or \npesticide application rates than other land uses. Thus, the more vulnerable zones in mountain \nareas with little arable land use may have low ADGWP risk. However, some of the less \n   \n10 \nvulnerable areas in the low-lying part of the study area have a higher ADGWP risk mainly \ndue to the higher density of arable land use areas. The land use layer was overlain with the \ngroundwater water pollution vulnerability map, in order to reflect the ADGWP risk by \nconsidering pollution sources. Taking nitrate as an example, the result in Fig. 4 is in line with \nthe trend of the groundwater nitrate concentration data from four locations in the Northern \nIreland monitoring network in the study area.  \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Overlaying the land-use map on the groundwater vulnerability map in the Upper Bann \ncatchment. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nDRASTIC is helpful for tackling ADGWP at the catchment scale in the implementation of the \nEU Water Framework Directive (WFD). The EU WFD introduces an innovative, integrated \nand holistic approach to the protection and management of water resources. Agricultural \ndiffuse water pollution has been identified as a major threat to achieving the demands of the \nEU WFD (Ferrier et al., 2004; Torrecilla et al., 2005). So far, the answer to the question: \n\u201cwhat technical measures will actually be used or developed in the implementation of the EU \nWFD?\u201d is still largely unknown (UK EA, 2005). By considering seven factors in the pathway \nof soluble pollutants reaching groundwater from the ground surface, the DRASTIC results are \nuseful for guiding prevention activities for ADGWP by delineating groundwater pollution \nvulnerability zones. In addition, the DRASTIC model can be easily transferred to other \ncatchments by following the rules of parameter ranking defined in the DRASTIC manual. \n Although DRASTIC is an index method with the subjective weighting and the numerical \nvalue assignation for various factors, the selected factors and their subjective weights can \nreflect the key mechanism of processes in the groundwater pollution pathway well. Thus, \nDRASTIC has been used worldwide for groundwater vulnerability assessment at both large \n   \n11 \nand small scales (Worrall & Kolpin, 2004; Babiker et al., 2005; Hamza et al., 2007). \nNevertheless, DRASTIC has drawbacks in the prevention of ADGWP at the catchment scale. \nFor example, DRASTIC reflects pathway vulnerability in ADGWP, but both pathway \nvulnerability and pollution sources are needed for actual ADGWP management. Although the \noverlaying of the DRASTIC index and the land use maps in Fig. 4 provides a better result \nthan Fig. 2, judgement of the exact target zones for ADGWP prevention is still not easy. \nTherefore, it is necessary to develop a more reliable ADGWP risk assessment method that is \nable to explicitly point out high ADGWP zones by mathematically introducing the concept of \nthe risk of ADGWP and pollutant movement with runoff into DRASTIC.  \n With the advantages of spatial data management, analysis and visualisation, GIS can \ngreatly facilitate the application of the DRASTIC model by improving the efficiency of data \npreparation and index calculation in raster data format.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe vulnerability maps of groundwater pollution for both general pollutants and pesticide in \nthe Upper Bann catchment, Northern Ireland, were generated using the DRASTIC method in \nan ArcGIS environment. These results can guide the ADGWP prevention activities at the \ncatchment scale and hence are helpful for the implementation of the EU WFD in handling the \nADGWP. However, the DRASTIC result is the pathway vulnerability of groundwater \npollution instead of the groundwater pollution risk.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of GSNI, EHS, CEH \nUK, BADC and DARD for providing the relevant data.
