Extra-\nordinary wealth is often regarded with envy and might raise the suspicion that it can \nonly be accumulated with the help of a minimalist state that does not concern itself \nwith the plight of the many. This raises the issue whether a high number of \nbillionaires can co-exist with a high-taxing, interventionist, social and welfare \nspending government? These two questions are at the heart of this paper\u2019s analysis. \nTo answer them we undertake a quantitative analysis of the global Forbes list of \nbillionaires. \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \nWhat determines the accumulation of super-riches around the world? Table 1 \nprovides an overview of the number of citizens from each country with an estimated \nwealth of over one billion US$ as listed in Forbes (2001, 2002, 2003) as a rounded \naverage over the period 2001 to 2003. Clearly the big and rich countries dominate the \ntop of the list. The most striking result is perhaps the exceptional number of \nbillionaires in the US, which has far more super-rich people than any other country in \nthe world. On the other hand, there are billionaires in many countries, including \ndeveloping ones. \n< Insert Table 1 about here > \nPerhaps surprisingly, very little research has been undertaken to explain the \nvariation in the incidence of extra-ordinary wealth. Indeed, this seems to be the first \nstudy looking at the issue from a global perspective. What does exist are single \ncountry studies analyzing in which sectors great fortunes were made and whether \nthese sectors are characterized by restrictions to competition \u2013 see Siegfried and \nRoberts (1991) for the UK, Blitz and Siegfried (1992) for the US, Siegfried and \nRound (1994) for Australia, Hazledine and Siegfried (1997) for New Zealand. In all \nof these studies the economic sector was identified in which the fortunes were \noriginally generated. Economist and economic historian experts were then asked to \nevaluate the degree of competitiveness in each sector. All country studies found that \nthe fortunes were made in a great variety of sectors. Also, around two thirds of \nfortunes were made, contrary to what one might have expected, in sectors, which \nwere judged as competitive by the experts. \n \n 3 \nResearch design \nOur dependent variable is the number of billionaires in each country. To even out \nunusual anomalies of a specific year we use the rounded average over the period \n2001 to 2003 as listed in Forbes (2001, 2002, 2003). The lists usually count a fortune \nheld by various members of one family as one entry, which is appropriate for our \npurposes here as the fortune is likely to stem from the same source. The ownership of \npublicly traded companies is valued at share market prices. For privately held \ncompanies estimates of revenues and prevailing share price to revenue ratios for \nsimilar publicly-traded companies were used to estimate their value (Forbes, 17 \nMarch 2003: 140). Where available the estimated value of art collections, real estate \netc. is also included. \nOur first hypothesis is that a high incidence of extra-ordinary wealth is \nassociated with the very core of economic freedom, namely the freedom to own \nproperty and to make use of it for one\u2019s own economic benefit. This is because \nhuman beings are characterized by great differences in entrepreneurial skill, \nintelligence, perseverance, leadership and other economically relevant human \nqualities. In countries where individuals are allowed to pursue their own economic \ninterest these differences will invariably result in great and often extra-ordinary \ndifferences in economic wealth. We use the \u2018protection of property rights\u2019 sub-index \nof the US Heritage Foundation\u2019s (2003) Index of Economic Freedom \n(PROPERTYRIGHTS), which measures the security and enforcement of private \nproperty on a one to five scale. Unfortunately, the Heritage Foundation data goes \nonly back in time until 1995 and we use the average values between 1995 and 2001. \nOf course, contemporaneous great wealth has often been created many years or even \ndecades back and then bequeathed to the current generation\u2019s super rich. It is highly \n 4 \nlikely that the extent of protection of property rights is strongly correlated over time. \nHowever, in the absence of actual historical data on the extent of private property \nprotection, we use a further rather crude measure, namely the number of years a \ncountry\u2019s economy has been under Communist rule (YEARS COMMUNIST). To \ncreate this variable we used the assessment and data provided by Kornai (1992, table \n1.1), extended by information taken from Keesing\u2019s Record of World Events. \nOur second hypothesis is that even where the very core of economic freedom \nexists super fortunes cannot emerge if the economy is subject to a great extent of \ngovernment intervention. High income and corporate taxes, high government \nexpenditures, widespread government ownership of businesses and industries and \nlarge-scale government interference with wages and prices might prevent the \ncreation of great wealth. We use a range of variables to measure \u201cbig\u201d government. \nFirst, a measure of the fiscal burden a government imposes upon an economy \n(FISCALBURDEN), which assesses countries according to the level of the top \nincome and corporate tax rates and the extent of government expenditures. Second, \nwe use a measure of the extent of general government intervention into the economy \n(GOVINTERVENTION), which assesses government consumption and government \nownership of businesses. Third comes a measure of wage and price controls \n(GOVCONTROL), which refers to the existence of minimum wage laws and \ngovernment interference with the setting of prices. These three variables are also \ntaken from Heritage Foundation (2003) and are all measured on a one to five scale. \nThe fourth measure is taken from IMF (2002) and refers to the level of public social \nand other welfare expenditures relative to GDP (%SOCWELFARE). For all these \nvariables the 1995 to 2001 average value was taken. \n 5 \nOur third hypothesis is that a high degree of competition in national economies is \nnot a hindrance to the creation of super fortunes. This is somewhat difficult to test. \nOn a global scale, we have no direct measure of the degree of general competition \nwithin national economies. However, we use the absence of tariff protection and \nnon-tariff barriers as our measure of the degree of competition national economies \nare exposed to (TRADEOPEN). This variable is also measured on a one to five scale \nand taken from Heritage Foundation (2003). The rationale is that competition within \nan economy is higher the less protection exists against competitors from foreign \ncountries. \nA number of further control variables are included. The rationale for including \npopulation size is simply that more populous countries are likely to have more super \nriches than small countries (data from World Bank, 2003). The association with per \ncapita income is not so clear-cut, but it might be easier to accumulate great wealth in \nan economy where people are generally wealthy, but of course much less wealthy \nthan the super rich (data from Heston, Summers and Aten, 2002). In Weberian \ntradition, a Protestant culture might promote a work ethic that is conducive to the \naccumulation of wealth. Also, such a culture might view economic success not with \nsuspicion, but as the just consequence of righteous behavior. The percentage of \npopulation that is Protestant (%PROTESTANT) is taken from Parker (2000). A US \ndummy variable is included to account for its special role. The OECD dummy \ncaptures any structural differences between developed and developing countries, \nwhich might exist. Both population size and per capita income enter the regressions \nin logged form to render their distributions less skewed.  \nA model with the number of billionaires in each country as the dependent \nvariable cannot simply be estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS). This is \n 6 \nbecause the dependent variable is only partly continuous with positive probability \nmass at the value of zero. An appropriate estimator for such a model is the Tobit \nestimator. \n \nResults \nColumn I of table 2 tests our hypotheses. Due to its lower availability, \n%SOCWELFARE is only added to the model in column II. The two regression \nresults show very little difference even though the sample is smaller in column II. \n< Insert Table 2 about here > \nThe estimates clearly suggest evidence in favor of our first hypothesis. A greater \nguarantee of private property is positively associated, whereas a higher number of \nyears under Socialist\/Communist dictatorship is negatively associated with the \nincidence of great wealth. On the basis of our results we reject our second \nhypothesis, however. Neither a higher fiscal burden, nor a greater extent of \ngovernment intervention, nor a greater extent of governmental interference with \nprices and wages has a negative effect on the incidence of great wealth. The same is \ntrue for higher social and other welfare expenditures. One might wonder whether this \nresult is perhaps due to the correlation of these variables. However, entering them \neither separately or in combinations of one, two or three does not change the results. \nThe TRADEOPEN variable coefficient is positive and statistically significant in \ncolumn I and marginally insignificant in column II. Our estimation results therefore \nsuggest that trade openness is conducive to the accumulation of great wealth or at \nleast not detrimental to it. In as much as trade openness captures the degree of \ncompetition prevailing in national economies, this result suggests that a high degree \nof competition does not represent a barrier to the accumulation of great fortunes. \n 7 \nAs concerns our further control variables, we find the expected positive impact \nof population size and per capita income. The US dummy is highly statistically \nsignificant, confirming the special position of this country that even a cursory glance \nat table 1 would already reveal (deleting the US from the sample leads to very similar \nresults for the other variables). Interestingly, however, the OECD dummy is highly \ninsignificant, suggesting that there is no fundamental difference between developed \nand developing countries, of course conditional on our other explanatory variables. \nThe accumulation of great fortunes is not facilitated by a Protestant work ethic and \nculture as measured by %PROTESTANT. \n \nConclusion \nThe accumulation of great fortunes creates uneasiness, envy and concern in many \npeople. Whatever might speak against such fortunes, our results demonstrate that \ntheir existence is not incompatible with an interventionist government spending a \ngreat deal of the national income on social and other welfare purposes. Great \nfortunes also do not seem to be dependent on a low degree of competition. The \nprotection and enforcement or private property is key and it is easier to accumulate \ngreat wealth in richer than in poorer countries. \n 8 \nReferences \nBlitz, R.C. and Siegfried, J.J.
