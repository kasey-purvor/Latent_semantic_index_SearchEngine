It is divided into two halves: the development of \na model of the determinants of welfare and revenue systems, and a cross-national data \nanalysis to test the model. \nThe first half applies an earlier conceptual model to explain the development of social \npolicies and welfare states in the \u201eWest\u201f, in particular Europe, in terms of the \u201e5 I\u201fs\u201f: \nindustrialisation, interests, institutions, ideas, and the international environment. The strengths \nand weaknesses of the model are then considered when applied to the very different terrain of \nthe developing world. In this article, we further apply the model to the emergence of fiscal \nsystems of taxation and state revenues \u2013 again identifying parallels and differences in the \n  \n3 \nability of this framework to explain fiscal systems in the South compared with the North. It is \nnot our intention to provide a systematic review of the factors affecting state revenue \nstructures, which would require a much longer article. Rather, we consider the effectiveness \nof the extant \u201e5 I\u201fs\u201f model to shed light on cross-national patterns in welfare and fiscal \nsystems. \nIn the second part, we turn to quantitative cross-national evidence. We summarise our \nearlier analysis of welfare regimes in developing countries and then go on to apply the data to \nstate revenue sources. In both cases, we use cluster analysis based on data for 2000. Finally, \nwe present our findings on the relationship between welfare regimes and state revenue \nstructures. The conclusion asks: Is there a relationship between specific revenue structures, \nregime types and welfare outcomes across the global South? It also adds qualifications and \ncautions about interpreting this type of analysis. \n \nThe determinants of welfare and revenue systems \nGough (2008) reviewed theories of Western welfare states and considered their relevance or \notherwise for understanding social policies in the developing world (see also Gough & \nTherborn, 2010). There is a long history of case studies and comparative research into social \nprogrammes across the OECD world which can be drawn on, for example Castles, Leibfried, \nLewis, Obinger & Pierson (2010), Saunders (2009), Uusitalo (1984) and Wilensky (1975). On \nsuch a basis, Gough developed a model of policymaking which identified five determinants of \nsocial policy. These were labelled the \u201e5 I\u201fs\u201f:  \n\uf0b7 Industrialisation: industrialisation, social structures, demography and development \n\uf0b7 Interests: collective actors, parties and power resources  \n\uf0b7 Institutions: states, constitutions, democracy, political systems  \n\uf0b7 Ideas: culture, ideologies and epistemic communities \n  \n4 \n\uf0b7 International influences: war, economic links and dependencies, international \norganisations and networks. \n \nGough then considered the model\u201fs relevance to understanding social policy across \nthe developing world and came to very different conclusions. In the words of Gough and \nTherborn (2010: p. 711):  \nFirst, the developmental paths of European welfare states are not likely to be repeated. \nSecond, an array of social programmes already exists in the global South, but they do \nnot yet coalesce into an alternative \u201esocial policy model\u201f. Third, these programmes are \nlikely to expand in favoured locations, but they will move forward along their own \npaths. \n \nOur first task in this article is to apply this approach to research on the financing of \nwelfare systems. Does the \u201e5 I\u201fs\u201f model illuminate the structure and policies of tax states as \nwell as the structure and policies of welfare states? And if so, can it do any better in \nunderstanding the financing regimes of the developing world? To answer these questions, we \ndraw predominantly on the volume edited by Br\u00e4utigam, Fjeldstad and Moore (2008) where \nsimilar conceptual categories were deployed. We consider each in turn. \n \nFinance systems in developing countries \nIndustrialisation and development: The association of greater proportionate tax revenues with \nhigher levels of economic development is a robust finding across both time and space \u2013 a \nrelationship first noticed by Adolf Wagner in the 19th century and named after him. \u201eOfficial \ntax-collectors in richer countries, and especially in countries with a relatively small \nagricultural sector, succeed in capturing higher proportions of national income for the \n  \n5 \ngovernment\u201f (Moore, 2008: 40). However, there is still much variation in tax revenue \nunaccounted for by income per head, and the reasons for the relationship are disputed. \nWagner himself, and several social policy scholars, explained it in terms of industrial society \nfostering new needs and demands for public services. Others credited the spread of the formal \neconomy, which enables records to be kept and taxes to be collected in a more uniform and \nbureaucratic way (Ardant, 1975; Brewer, 1989). There is, in fact, no contradiction between \nthese two explanations, which can be subsumed within a \u201emodernisation\u201f framework. \nEconomic development, as well as expanding tax revenues, also brings with it a shift \nin the nature of taxation: \u201efrom levying taxes on specific items (salt, tobacco, carriages, \nindividuals) to levying them according to accounting categories (income, sales, turnover \nvalued-added, profits)\u201f (Moore, 2008: 40). Moore claimed that in the developed world this \nwas accompanied by a shift from coercion to contract in the tax relationship. Coercive \ntaxation is characterised by arbitrary assessment, coercive collection and the absence of any \nrepresentation for taxpayers in tax policy decisions. Contract taxation is characterised by \n\u201e\u201crevenue bargaining\u201d \u2013 the exchange of tax revenues (for the state) for institutionalized \ninfluence over public policy (for citizens)\u201f (Moore, 2008: 36). This is an idealised picture, \neven for advanced democratic countries, and certainly cannot be applied or assumed in the \nglobal South. Rather, interests and institutions, the second and third factors in our model, \nassume a powerful role in mediating the relationship between economic development and tax \nrevenues. \nInterests: That the pattern of taxes normally reflects the interests of the powerful is \nperhaps too obvious a point to make, though it has rarely been subjected to scholarly \ninvestigation (Br\u00e4utigam, 2008). Similarly, the ability of taxes that are perceived to be unjust \nor coercive to foster tax rebellions is a part of the historical record, from the Roman Empire to \nthe Poll Tax revolt against the Thatcher government in Britain. Thus, there is a complex link \n  \n6 \nbetween interest groups, perceived interests and the tax system. The direction of causality is \ndifficult to disentangle. For example, there is an interesting debate over the extent to which \nundemocratic governments imposing tax hikes fosters demands for democratic reforms. Ross \n(2004) argued that if an undemocratic government raises the tax burden without a \ncommensurate increase in desired services, then citizens tend to press for greater \nrepresentation. Lieberman (2003) researched the ways that race and class determine \nbargaining power over taxes and public expenditures in Brazil and South Africa. He noted \nhow a cross-class alliance among whites in South Africa fostered higher income tax levels \nand higher benefit levels (for whites) \u2013 a pattern we shall observe below.  \nInstitutions: The role of taxation in building states is a common theme among students \nof the state, before and after Schumpeter. For Levi (1988: p. ?), \u201eThe history of state revenue \nproduction is the history of the evolution of the state\u201f. Michael Mann\u201fs immense historical \nstudy of power emphasised the role of tax-raising powers (Mann, 1993: notably chapter 11). \nBr\u00e4utigam (2008: 1) wrote: \u201eTaxation may play the central role in building and sustaining the \npower of states, and shaping their ties to society\u201f. Though theoretical explanations of this \nrelationship differ, all agree that the administrative, fiscal and institutional capacity of \ngovernments to pursue public goals both engenders and reflects tax raising-powers. Here the \nparallels between institutional determinants of the welfare state and the tax state are very \nstrong. \nYet, more detailed studies of political institutions reveal different associations with tax \nlevels. Gerring, Thacker and Moreno (2005) found that countries with \u201ecentripetal\u201f \nconstitutions, whose incentive for \u201evoice\u201f rather than \u201eveto\u201f (political systems that were \nunitary rather than federal, parliamentary rather than presidential, and list-proportional rather \nthan first-past-the-post), could collect higher levels of taxes (cited in Br\u00e4utigam, 2008: 10\u2013\n11). Steinmo (1993) related the differences in tax systems between Sweden, the US and \n  \n7 \nBritain according to features of their constitutions, electoral rules etc. The extent of variability \namong global South states is likely to be greater still. \nFurthermore, the impact of democracy on tax revenues is disputed for developing \ncountries. Fauvelle-Aymar (1999) found that autocracies have higher levels of taxation than \ndemocracies, whereas Thies (2004) found the opposite. This is similar to the contradictory \nfindings on the links between democracy and the origins of social policies (Gough, 2008). \n Ideas: The influence of culture, dominant ideas and policy learning also features in \nthe literature on tax systems. For example, cultural values have an independent effect, as \nwhen public spiritedness or cultures of giving, such as zakat, foster a greater willingness to \npay taxes. Tax compliance is affected by the perceived legitimacy of the government. This \nmerges into a more instrumental account of tax compliance: \u201eCountries with sizeable shadow \neconomies or informal sectors have lower tax morale, as people in the formal sector can more \neasily observe large numbers of others escaping the tax net\u201f (Alm & Torgler, 2004: p. ?). \nLevi\u201fs finding in some European countries that a belief in the welfare state makes people \nmore willing to pay taxes, reminds us again of the close link between tax states and welfare \nstates \u2013 if only in the most developed European welfare states (Levi, 1988 (not a quote, so no \npage number)). The emergence of \u201erevenue bargaining\u201f cements this link. However, the \nwidespread acceptance of the need to pay taxes may rest on a prior \u201epolitical settlement\u201f \nbetween major interest groups, such as the broad \u201eKeynesian\u201f agreement between capital and \nlabour in Western Europe after the Second World War. Dominant ideas will in part reflect \ndominant interests. \nInternational influences: The impact of war on the development of the European tax \nstate is prominent and much researched. According to Tilly (1985), war made the modern \nstate; it requires both administrative capacities and taxes. For this reason, preparation for war \nand war-fighting has also fostered popular demands for accountability and for parliaments to \n  \n8 \nrepresent the tax payers. Thies (2005) extended this argument to the existence of external \nthreats to a state and also to internal threats from rival elites. Peacock and Wiseman\u201fs (1961) \n\u201eplateau\u201f effect then argued that war-time levels of taxation and spending will frequently \npersist into peacetime. \nAside from war, international influence is the arena, claimed Moore (2008), where the \npast fiscal history of Europe and the OECD offers the fewest lessons to the developing world. \nUnlike the core OECD states, countries in the developing world today exist in a transformed \ninternational environment which profoundly reduces their dependence on domestic tax-payers \nfor revenue. This is for four main reasons. First, many developing countries are in receipt of \nlarge non-tax revenues from natural resources which are in demand due to the emergence of a \nglobal economy. This provides these governments with natural resource rents and reduces \ntheir reliance on taxation (Hinojosa, Bebbington, Barrientos & Addison, 2010). Second, for \nmany other poor countries, foreign aid from donors provides a second external revenue \nstream. Both of these large revenue streams \u201ewere not available to governments when the \nOECD countries were comparably poor\u201f (Moore, 2008: 34). Many have argued that these \nstreams create a \u201eresource curse\u201f and \u201eaid dependency\u201f, respectively. In turn, they argue, this \nfosters patronage, waste and graft, and renders governments illegitimate, ineffective and \nunaccountable.  \nThird, reliance on external revenues undermines the social contract and revenue \nbargaining and encourages middle-class exit into private and overseas welfare markets. \n\u201eUnless the middle class is also catered for by state provision, good quality social provision \ncan\u201ft be sustained\u201f (Deacon, 2007: 172). But to bind in the middle classes, if not the elite, \nrequires a willingness to pay taxes, which is undermined if taxation of mineral wealth, or aid \nor other grants from abroad weakens this social bond, or if private options are easily \navailable. \u201eThe proposition is that the dependence of governments on broad taxation for \n  \n9 \nrevenue is good for the quality of governance\u201f (Moore, 2008: 34). Finally, the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and other Intergovernmental Organisations (IGOs) have played an \nunprecedented role in guiding and enforcing harsh fiscal policies in the developing world, \nwith no parallel in the \u201eemerging market economies\u201f of the North in the 19th and 20th \ncenturies. \nWe can draw a mixed conclusion from this survey for the prospects for effective, \nsustainable and non-coercive taxes in the developing world. On the one hand, economic and \npolitical development is likely to foster less coercive taxation and greater revenues. \u201eCoercive \ntaxation is especially likely where ruling elites are unrestrained by their subjects\u2026; \neconomies are poor, rural, agrarian and subsistence\u201f (Moore, 2008: 62). On the other hand, \nthe absence of clearly represented interest groups and political settlements, the permeability of \npolitical institutions, the reliance on rents and aid, the intrusion of the IMF and the resultant \n\u201edependent learning\u201f all undermine the development of effective governance via revenue \nbargaining and the ability to raise sustainable tax revenues.  \n \nWelfare systems and fiscal systems  \nHow do these findings compare with those of the origins and development of welfare \nsystems? What are the implications for the development of tax states and welfare states in the \ndeveloping world? Again we consider the 5 I\u201fs in turn. \nFirst, the development and industrialisation explanation holds some truth: both tax and \nsocial spending shares are associated with levels of national income per head. This can be \nexplained from both the spending side (to meet new \u201esocial needs\u201f and demographic \npressures) and the revenue side (the ability of states more effectively to levy taxes in \nemerging market economies). However, this relationship leaves much variation unexplained \nand is mediated by other factors. Furthermore, it is severely qualified in today\u201fs developing \n  \n10 \nworld by several factors. First, the pervasive dualism of developing economies \u2013 the gulf \nbetween major cities and rural areas and the extensive spatial inequalities \u2013 is beyond \ncomparison with Europe now and Europe a century ago. The role of families and households \nin attempting to mitigate risk and secure welfare is also far more extensive in the developing \nworld than in the developed countries. Finally, the international economic environment is \nvery different and in general less benign than the post-war period of Western welfare states. \nSecond, the role of countervailing interests and \u201epressures from below\u201f in shaping \nwelfare and tax systems is more complex and indeterminate than the history of the West \nrecords. This is partly the result of the dualisms and fragmentation noted above. In addition, \ntrade unions and labour-based political organisations have been squeezed between repression \nand deregulation, and are thus much weaker then their counterparts in post-war Western \nwelfare states. Moreover, business and financial interests exert more structural and agency \npower. The ability of other collective \u201ehorizontal\u201f sources of identity and mobilisation to \nsubstitute for this is unproven. None of this rules out an emerging collective interest in \nexpanding rights-based welfare, but it makes it less likely. \nThird, the role of the welfare state and the tax state in European state-building has \nsome parallels in developing countries with effective states, such as in East Asia. Here one \nmight expect to see the parallel expansion of state social programmes, spending and taxation. \nHowever, in poorer world regions, the state-building process has been stalled by a variety of \nfactors, including the intervention of powerful external actors. A welfare state must \npresuppose a minimal Weberian state. Similarly, \u201edemocracy\u201f has an ambiguous effect on the \ntax-welfare state; the conflicting evidence points to an undetermined relationship mediated by \nother factors. \nFourth, the cultural variety of the developing world exceeds that which is found within \nthe homelands of the welfare state and its import is still not fully understood. Quite new ideas \n  \n11 \nsupportive of an active state have emerged, notably that of the \u201edevelopmental state\u201f in Japan \nand East Asia, but this does not usually entail an extensive tax and welfare state. In much of \nthe world, dualist economies and clientelist politics foster low tax morale and undermine \nwillingness to pay taxes and use public services. Finally, the dominant ideology of neo-\nliberalism has, over the past three decades, blocked indigenous welfarist ideas and imposed \n\u201edependent learning\u201f.  \nFifth, the global environment has utterly changed since the first industrial \ntransformations in the 19th and the first three quarters of the 20th century. Here the ability of \nEuropean history to offer any useful lessons is most severely tested. The developing world \ntoday is enmeshed in a network of economic relationships with powerful financial and \ncorporate actors exerting structural power, is part of a world society of intergovernmental \ninstitutions with powers to constrain and sometimes control Southern governments, and is \nsubject to ruling ideas and ideologies promulgated by powerful epistemic communities, \nincluding that of economists. Globalisation has provided in certain countries streams of rent \nand aid monies not available to Western countries in their modernisation phase, which can \nundermine the scope for domestic taxation and domestic welfare institutions. For the past \nthree decades, the diverse domestic roads to the institution we now label \u201ethe welfare state\u201f \nwere replaced by a global one-size-fits-all road, mapped and laid down outside the countries \nconcerned, though this neo-liberal model is now slowly breaking up.  \nAll these contrasts constrain the emergence of tax and social policies in the developing \nworld \u2013 and the lessons which can be learned from the earlier histories in the West. To deal \nwith this variety, complexity and under-determination, we go on to develop a distinctive \nconceptual framework and methodology in the remainder of this article. \n \n  \n12 \nWelfare and revenue regimes in the developing world: an empirical cluster \nanalysis \nWelfare regime clusters \nOne underlying lesson from European social policy is the importance of path dependency: \nhow, once established, patterns or constellations of social policies tend to reproduce and are \nrather impervious to radical change, short of encountering a major crisis or external \nintervention. Esping-Andersen (1990) argued this most forcefully in his influential framework \nof welfare state regimes, which has received considerable empirical confirmation. Gough and \nWood extended this framework to identify a wider range of \u201ewelfare\u201f regimes (distinguished \nfrom welfare state regimes) across the developing world (Gough, 2004; Gough & Wood with \net al., 2004; Wood & Gough, 2006). The regime concept rests on the idea that linear scoring \napproaches do not capture the systemic realities of country welfare or illfare systems:  \nThe linear scoring approach (more or less power, democracy, or spending) contradicts \nthe sociological notion that power, democracy, or welfare are relationally structured \nphenomena \u2026 Welfare-state variations\u2026 are not linearly distributed, but clustered by \nregime types. (Esping-Anderson, 1990: 26). \n  \nThe appropriate method for testing this hypothesis, we argue, is cluster analysis. This \nis not a form of multivariate analysis, but a sophisticated descriptive technique for assigning a \nlarge number of observations into a smaller number of groups. In a recent article we used \ncluster analysis to map the welfare regimes of 65 non-OECD countries in 1990 and 2000 \n(Abu Sharkh & Gough, 2010). Full details of the methodology, techniques and data sources \nare provided there and in Gough and Abu Sharkh (2010), but we summarise them here.   \nWe use two clustering techniques in sequence. We begin with dendograms generated \nby Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and observe the number of major clusters these \n  \n13 \nidentify. At the next stage, we turn to K-means Cluster Analysis (KCA), using the previous \nanalysis to specify numbers of clusters in advance. Following numerous trials, we settle on \nten clusters, of which two comprise single countries, leaving us with eight. In presenting our \nresults, we go on to order the resulting clusters by comparing the distances between final \ncluster centres, generated by KCA, starting with the cluster that most resembles OECD \nwelfare states, which we label A. Most remote from this cluster are clusters G and H. \nOur data sets exclude the OECD world: these rich countries are sufficiently distinct \nthat their inclusion can diminish discrimination within the rest of the world. In order to avoid \nlarge numbers of smaller states, we also exclude countries with a population of less than 3 \nmillion people. This left potentially 127 countries and a final tally of 65 countries with \nsufficient data. For the welfare regime analysis we sought data on four pairs of variables: \ngovernment welfare spending (public spending on education and health as a share of GDP and \nsocial security contributions as a share of total government revenues); public service delivery \n(immunisation against measles and secondary school enrolment of females); the scale of \nexternal transfers (official aid and remittances from overseas migrants); and welfare outcomes \n(life expectancy at birth and the illiteracy rate of young people aged 15\u201324 years). \nTable 1 about here \nTable 1 presents our main findings. Countries in cluster A exhibit some characteristics \nof Western welfare states and may be labelled proto-welfare states. These countries share in \ncommon relatively extensive state commitments to welfare provision and relatively effective \ndelivery of services plus moderately extensive social security programmes and superior \nwelfare outcomes (by, it must be stressed, the standards of the non-OECD world). Apart from \nIsrael and Costa Rica, this cluster comprises two distinct geographical zones and historical \nantecedents: the countries of the former Soviet Union and its bloc members, and the relatively \nindustrialised countries of southern South America. Both developed European-style forms of \n  \n14 \nsocial protection policies in the middle of the 20th century, and both suffered degradation of \nthese in the late 20th century through the external imposition of neo-liberal programmes.  \nCluster B exhibits the second-best level of welfare outcomes and social service \noutputs alongside low levels of state social spending (and low reliance on external flows of \naid and remittances). This interesting combination suggests that security and illfare are \nmitigated by fast-growing average incomes and\/or by other domestic, non-state informal \ninstitutions. This combination is found in three major world regions: (i) China and most \ncountries in East Asia from Korea through Thailand to Sri Lanka (except Indonesia which \ndropped out of this cluster in 2000 having suffered most from the 1997 crisis); (ii) the \nremaining larger countries of South and Central America not in cluster A; and (iii) some \ncountries in Western Asia (Iran, Turkey and Tajikistan). Countries in this group are mainly \nbut not always low-middle income, with high growth rates, but are relatively undemocratic \nand unequal. They include some countries that have achieved historic reductions in poverty \nlevels. One notable finding is that this cluster includes most countries of externally induced, \nreactive modernisation.  \nCluster C is mainly distinguished by great reliance on remittances from abroad which \naccount for 9 per cent of gross national income on average and which constitute an informal \nfunctional alternative to public transfers. It comprises small countries in the Caribbean and \nCentral America, plus Ecuador, Morocco and Sri Lanka. \nIn southern and eastern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and \nKenya), a distinct cluster D exhibits relatively extensive public social policy (in both \nexpenditures and outreach and literacy levels), but with poor health outcomes, due in large \npart to the HIV\u2013AIDS pandemic.  \nCluster F, with at its core the countries of the Indian sub-continent \u2013 India, Pakistan, \nBangladesh and Nepal \u2013 exhibits high levels of illiteracy and low numbers of females in \n  \n15 \nsecondary education. These are by no means \u201efailed states\u201f: India is proclaimed as a future \neconomic giant. Moreover, they boast a plethora of targeted social programmes and informal \nsecurity mechanisms. However, the absence of effective schooling, health and social \nprotection policies, coupled with highly gendered outcomes, according to such indicators as \nthe population sex ratio, betokens high levels of insecurity among the mass of the population.  \nClusters G and H, mainly countries in sub-Saharan Africa, exhibit low and in some \ncases falling life expectancy alongside relatively weak states with low levels of public \nresponsibility, indicated both by spending levels and social outputs, and higher dependence on \noverseas aid. The prevalence of poverty is also high and persistent.  \nThus, at the turn of the century, we find a highly variegated pattern of welfare and \nillfare systems across the global South. We conclude that different groups of countries in the \ndeveloping world face divergent threats to human wellbeing and divergent potentials for \nsocial policies to mitigate these. In Central and parts of Eastern Europe and parts of South \nAmerica, despite serious erosion of their post-war welfare systems, we see a potential for new \nforms of social citizenship. In much of East and Southeast Asia, much of Latin America, Iran, \nTurkey and possibly other parts of the MENA region, we find distinctive, different yet \nmoderately effective informal welfare systems alongside small state sectors. In the Indian \nsubcontinent, there is a plethora of formal and informal programmes, but with little realisation \nin terms of spending, delivery or welfare outcomes. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, what \nsocial programmes there are have been eroded and submerged beneath a rising tide of human \nneed; this remains a zone of high insecurity and illfare. \n  \nRevenue structures: a cluster analysis \nThe relative size of total government revenues as a share of Gross Domestic product (GDP) \nhas changed very little over the past decade and a half, taking the developing world as a \n  \n16 \nwhole. But there exists tremendous heterogeneity of tax and revenue levels, even within the \nusual categories of countries, such as region or income level or dependence on oil and \nminerals. Again, to grasp this heterogeneity, we use the same two-stage cluster analysis. \nWe distinguish the following major categories of government revenues: Total \ngovernment revenue = taxes + social security contributions + other government revenues \n(notably oil and mineral rents) + aid and grants from IGOs and foreign governments. \nTo begin with, we undertake a cluster analysis of the four government revenues in the \nidentity above, the results of which are presented in Table 2. The full outputs for this \nclustering are shown in Gough and Abu Sharkh (2010). The analysis identifies four clusters of \ncountries where one form of revenue is dominant, and a fifth where this is not the case.  \nTable 2 about here \nThis reveals the following. First, countries with relatively high levels of social security \ncontributions are geographically clustered among the ex-communist countries in Eastern \nEurope and the ex-Soviet Union: all are in this cluster except for Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. \nIn addition there are three countries in Latin America \u2013 Uruguay, Brazil and Costa Rica \u2013 \nwith relatively extensive social security contributions, which thereby stand apart from the rest \nof the continent. \nSecond, the cluster with substantial tax revenues is unexpectedly limited to just two \nworld regions: the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and southern and eastern Africa. \nOf the countries for which we have data, every MENA country is in this group except Yemen \nand Iran, and every country in southern and eastern Africa except Botswana. (In all these \nthree other cases, \u201eother revenues\u201f dominate.)  \nThird, three of the four countries in the small country cluster defined by high reliance \non \u201eother revenues\u201f appear in the list of mineral rich countries of Hinojosa et al. (2008); their \nexport dependence ratios are Yemen (94%), Botswana (87%) and Iran (83%) \n  \n17 \nFourth, a greater relative reliance on overseas aid is mainly a feature of central and \nwestern sub-Saharan Africa; six of the nine countries in this region for which we have data \nfall into this cluster.  \nLastly, the largest cluster comprises countries with no dominant source of government \nrevenue. This includes all countries in East Asia and South Asia and the bulk of countries in \nLatin America. This is clearly a very heterogeneous group of countries, requiring further \ndisaggregation (see below). \n  \nWelfare regimes and revenue structures \nHow do the welfare regime clusters map onto the new data on revenue structures presented \nabove? To answer this, we first present the mean level of tax and revenue shares for each \ncountry grouped according to our welfare regime clusters in Table 3. Table 4 summarises the \nmean values for the clusters together with their standard deviations (s.d.). Further detail \nincluding box plots is provided in Abu Sharkh and Gough (2010). We summarise these \nbeginning with the broadest category \u2013 total state revenues \u2013 and then break this down in the \nconstituent revenue streams.  \nTables 3 & 4 about here \nTotal state revenues: This includes all revenue sources embracing aid, revenues from \noil and minerals, all forms of taxes etc. There is a clear distinction here between welfare \nregimes A and D and all other countries. The proto-welfare states of cluster A are associated \nwith greater government revenues, between 25 and 35 per cent of GDP, as would be expected. \nIsrael and Croatia are outliers with revenues over 40 per cent of GDP, and Argentina is an \noutlier with 14 per cent GDP. But the anomalous high-spending\/low-security regime D in \nsouthern Africa also records high revenues, with Botswana showing revenues equal to 45 per \ncent GDP. \n  \n18 \nRegime B records considerably lower revenue shares, averaging 18 per cent GDP \n(with China a notable outlier with 7% GDP). The average is similar to that of regime E, \ncomprising Indonesia and four countries in central Africa. The lowest revenue shares are \nfound in regime F centred on the Indian sub-continent \u2013 but the three percentage-point \ndifference between it and regime B is small compared with the wide differences in welfare \noutcomes.  \nGovernment tax revenues: Focussing solely on governments\u201f abilities to raise tax \nrevenues if anything diminishes the distinctiveness of our welfare regime clusters, with one \nexception: regime D now records by far the highest mean tax share, exceeding the tax take of \nregime A countries by six percentage points. The proto-welfare states in cluster A record the \nsecond highest mean tax share of 17 per cent GDP, with Israel and Croatia again featuring as \nhigh tax outliers.  \nHowever, there is a considerable overlap in tax takes between cluster A and clusters B \nand C. In cluster B, there is considerable variation, with Turkey (20% GDP), Chile (17%) and \nKorea (16%) recording tax revenues higher than many in cluster A: the Gough\u2013Wood label of \n\u201einformal security regime\u201f does not do full justice to such countries. At the other extreme, \nChina records a remarkably low tax take of 7 per cent GDP. Regimes E, F and H exhibit tax \nlevels lower or equal to those in B, with considerable overlap. Thus, whatever it is that \nexplains the superior welfare outcomes in cluster B, it is not their tax shares (though of course \nthe absolute amounts of tax raised per head are higher). \nIncome tax revenues: When we narrow our focus further to revenues from income tax \nthe mean levels of all the welfare regime clusters from A to F reveal remarkably few \ndifferences (ranging between 3 and 5% GDP), apart from cluster D, where income taxation \naverages 10 per cent of GDP. However, the standard deviations are everywhere high, \n  \n19 \nsuggesting that factors other than government income tax capacity are critical in \ndiscriminating between our welfare regimes (as we would expect). \nSocial security contributions: When we turn to revenues from social security \ncontributions, the proto-welfare states of cluster A stand out with the average share exceeding \n8 per cent of GDP. In all other regimes, their share is trivial. Here, there is a clear link \nbetween welfare regime characteristics and one particular revenue source, as theories of \nwelfare state financing would predict. \nState mineral revenues: Finally, Table 3 also picks out those countries that are \ndependent on oil and mineral revenues. Simply eye-balling the table reveals little pattern; \ncountries with high mineral revenues are scattered across every welfare regime except for \ncluster A. The fact that none of the proto-welfare states are heavily mineral-dependent is \nworthy of further investigation. But outside this cluster there is no clear evidence of either a \n\u201eresource curse\u201f or a resource bonanza effect on welfare systems and welfare outcomes. \n \nConclusions and cautions \nThe literature review suggests that the \u201e5 I\u201fs\u201f explanatory model of welfare states in the West \nalso applies to the development of Western tax states and fiscal systems. However, it has less \npurchase in understanding welfare and revenue systems in the developing world. In the global \nSouth, the pattern of industrialisation, interest formation and representation, institutional \ndevelopment, ideational influences and the entire international environment are very different: \nmore complex, variegated and heterogeneous. Consequently, their ability to explain welfare \nand revenue systems is more indeterminate. \nThis report recognises this heterogeneity by using cluster analysis to identify patterns \nin welfare regimes and revenue systems across the developing world. It has analysed data for \n  \n20 \n65 non-OECD countries (excluding micro-states) for the year 2000, covering welfare regimes, \nrevenue structures and the relationship between the two. \nThe hypothesis that higher tax levels would be associated with greater state \neffectiveness in meeting welfare\/security needs is not clearly borne out by this cluster \nanalysis. It is only the scope of social security contributions that appears to correlate with \nproto-welfare states in the developing world. Here, there is evidence of a link between a \nspecific revenue source and proto-welfare state regimes. Moreover, this cluster relies very \nlittle on revenues from minerals and oil. Apart from Israel and Costa Rica, this cluster \ncomprises two distinct geographical zones and historical antecedents: the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union and its bloc members, and the relatively industrialised countries of \nsouthern South America.  \nThe fast-developing countries of East Asia and some other middle-income countries in \nLatin America and the MENA region present an interesting anomalous picture in 2000. They \nexhibit relatively low shares of government revenue, taxes, income taxes and social security \ncontributions, yet record relatively good social outputs and welfare outcomes. This suggests \nthat security and illfare are mitigated by fast-growing average incomes and\/or by other \ndomestic, non-state informal institutions. A notable finding is that this cluster includes most \ncountries of externally induced, reactive modernisation (Therborn\u201fs fourth route to \nmodernity), where states have been forced over longer periods to adjust to outside \ndevelopmental pressures (Therborn, 1992). This may indicate the presence of \u201edevelopmental \nstates\u201f with considerable infrastructure and steering capacity, but which have not prioritised \ntraditional social policies. Here, one might expect to see new forms of collective management \nof risk emerge. Indeed, this can already be seen in some of the outliers in this group, such as \nKorea and Chile (and China). \n  \n21 \nIn contrast to this pattern, we observe a small group of countries in southern\u2013eastern \nAfrica with high spending and high tax revenues, but with poor welfare outcomes. This \ncombination partly reflects the damaging effects of AIDS over the previous decade, but not \nentirely. Other world regions display low tax and expenditure levels, poor or ineffective social \noutputs and low welfare outcomes. In the case of much of sub-Saharan Africa, this partly \nreflects the impact of the HIV\u2013AIDS pandemic; further analysis of poverty outcomes is \nrequired to assess whether this is the major explanation. In the case of India and South Asia, \nwide gender differences and poor literacy rates are coupled with ineffective social \nprogrammes, notwithstanding high rates of economic growth. \nFinally, in interpreting these findings, several caveats and limitations should be borne \nin mind. Data available for a large number of countries are rarely capable of catching the \ndetail we require to map either welfare regimes or state revenue systems. Our expenditure, \noutput and outcome measures all centre on health and education; there are as of yet no \nreliable, regularly collected data on social protection expenditures across the developing \nworld, let alone more subtle measures of mandation and tax expenditures. For example, social \nprotection systems need not entail heavy state expenditures or revenues; they can be \nmandated by governments but administered privately, and the mandated contributions of \nemployers and employees may not figure as government revenues. Countries like Chile and \nKorea with such programmes are not picked up and therefore appear in the low-spending \ncluster B. Nor will social protection necessarily be picked up by social insurance \ncontributions \u2013 there has been a trend in recent years to expand social assistance and \nconditional cash transfers (CCTs). Again, we cannot even monitor regularised market \nprovision across the world, enabling us to distinguish non-mandatory private insurance and \nout-of-pocket payments. The paucity of international data on social protection and welfare \n  \n22 \nprogrammes is remarkable. Finally, the data we have used all refer to the year 2000: many \nnew and expanded social programmes have emerged since then which do not figure here. \n \nAcknowledgement  \nIan Gough acknowledges the support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council: this \nwork originated in the WeD (Wellbeing in Developing Countries) (please write out ESRC) \nESRC programme at the University of Bath.
