This has also been observed in cer-\ntain populations that have undergone relatively rapid\ntransition from rural to urban lifestyle [3-5]. Studies in\nlow- and middle-income countries have identified that\nPublished: 24 April 2006\nPopulation Health Metrics2006, 4:5 doi:10.1186\/1478-7954-4-5\nReceived: 06 December 2005\nAccepted: 24 April 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5\n\u00a9 2006AlMoosa et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPopulation Health Metrics 2006, 4:5 http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5risk factors for chronic diseases are more prevalent in\nurban than rural areas [6-9].\nAlthough the Sultanate of Oman has been successful in\nreducing communicable diseases and increasing life\nexpectancy at birth to 76 years for women and 71 for men\n[10], rapid cultural changes and social advances since\n1970 have led to the manifestation of a wide range of non-\ncommunicable diseases [11]. The 2004 population is\nextremely young, with only 3% aged 60 years or older\n[10].\nThe fifth Health Development Plan in Oman (1996\u2013\n2000) identified, for the first time, diabetes as a major\nconcern and set specific goals to prevent further progres-\nsion of the disease [12]. The National Diabetes Survey\nconducted in 1991 showed that 10% of the Omani popu-\nlation over the age of 20 years had diabetes mellitus,\nresulting in an estimated 80,000 people living with diabe-\ntes [13]. Also, a recent study of metabolic syndrome in an\nOmani city, Nizwa, reported a prevalence of high fasting\nglucose of 18% in 2001 [14].\nA recent study conducted in Oman [11] identified that\ndiabetes was associated with the classic risk factors [15],\nbut not urbanization. The authors' definition of urbaniza-\ntion was based on each wilayate (district) being divided\ninto two sections: the first section comprised the wilay-\nates' centers representing the urban area and the second\nsection comprised the villages or remote parts, which rep-\nresent the rural areas [11]. According to this definition,\n73.1% of the population resides in urban areas.\nConsistent with this definition, the World Bank and\nUNDP also present high figures of urbanization in Oman.\nSpecifically, in 2001 an estimated 76% of the population\nwas considered urban [16], compared to 77% in 2002\n[17].\nHowever, other studies suggest a very different urban-\nrural distribution (e.g. 11% urban in 1990 [18]; 10.6%\nurban in 1990 and 15.1% in 2000 [19]). Similarly, we\nbelieve the only area in Oman that can be considered\nurban is the capital region of Muscat, constituting 21.7%\nof the population in 2000.\nThe population density (persons\/km2) in the region of\nMuscat is 162.1, compared to 52.3 in the second most\npopulated region (Al Batinah), with the remaining\nregions relatively sparsely populated (0.3\u201315.8 persons\/\nkm2) [20]. In addition, about half of all commercial\nbanks, vehicles on the road, electricity connections, and\ntelephone lines in Oman are found in the capital region\nof Muscat, which can be seen as an indirect indication of\nurbanization [20]. Furthermore, health facilities are con-\ncentrated in the capital region; about 30% of all hospital\nbeds, and 40% of private health clinics are located in Mus-\ncat [20]. Moreover, the average occupancy rate of the Mus-\ncat hospitals is much higher than the other regions: 66%\ncompared to an average of 46% across the remaining\nregions [20]. The only international airport in the country\nis located in Muscat; the same is true for the only govern-\nment university. Finally, the presence of American compa-\nnies further demonstrates the potentially different lifestyle\namong those living in Muscat; there are four Starbucks\nand four McDonalds restaurants in Oman, all of which\nreside in Muscat.\nSocio-demographic characteristics of the urban and rural\npopulations also differ significantly. Table 1 shows the\nage, sex and educational distribution of the populations\nin Muscat and the remaining regions. Overall, Muscat has\na younger, better educated population with a slightly\nsmaller average family size.\nThe objectives of the present study are twofold: to meas-\nure the prevalence of diabetes and associated coronary\nrisk factors across demographic and socioeconomic\ndescriptors; and to determine the significant factors asso-\nciated with diabetes, in particular to examine whether\nurban residence as we have described above (i.e. living in\nthe capital region) is independently associated with dia-\nbetes, adjusting for other risk factors and demographic\nfactors.\nMethods\nStudy population and sampling method\nThe sample for the 2000 National Health Survey was cho-\nsen so that it would represent the ten regions in the Sul-\nTable 1: Socio-demographic characteristics of urban (Muscat) \nand rural populations\nUrban (%) Rural (%)\nAge\n20\u201329 40.5 41.2\n30\u201339 24.3 20.6\n40\u201349 14.5 10.9\n50\u201359 10.7 13.9\n\u2265 60 10.0 13.3\nSex\nMale 48.8 50.3\nFemale 51.2 49.7\nEducation level\nIlliterate 24.8 36.1\nLess than secondary 37.5 41.8\nSecondary or above 37.7 22.1\nAverage family size 7.3 8.0\nNote: Data are from the 2000 National Health SurveyPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPopulation Health Metrics 2006, 4:5 http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5tanate. First, a multi-stage stratified probability-sampling\ndesign was used to randomly select a number of wilayates\n(districts) from each region, according to proportional\nallocation of population size in each region. There are 59\nwilayates in Oman, of which 16 were chosen for the sur-\nvey. Second, within the wilayates, enumeration areas (as\ndefined by the 1993 census) were randomly selected.\nThird, within the enumeration areas, households were\nrandomly selected. The present analysis considered the\ncapital region of Muscat to be urban, and considered the\nremaining nine regions to be rural.\nAll subjects aged 20 and above in each of the chosen\nhouseholds were requested to participate in the survey.\nOut of the 2044 occupied households in the sample, 1968\nwere interviewed with a total of 17,574 subjects (96%), of\nwhich 7179 were aged 20 or older. The response rate of\nsubjects aged 20 or above was relatively high for all med-\nical measurements: height, weight and blood pressure\n(90%), waist measurement (89%), hip measurement\n(86%), fasting blood glucose (81%) and serum choles-\nterol samples (82%).\nData collection\nA questionnaire developed by the Ministry of Health was\nadministered by trained interviewers. The questionnaire\nincluded demographic background (age, sex, marital sta-\ntus, educational status, and working status) and self-\nreported diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking\nhabits. The survey protocol also included measurements\nof blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumfer-\nence, taken by nurses according to WHO recommenda-\ntions [21]. Blood samples of venous fasting blood glucose\nand serum cholesterol were also collected. Details of the\nsample collections are given elsewhere [22]. Fasting was\nensured through visits by the interview teams to the\nhouses on two consecutive days: on the first day, partici-\npants were requested to fast after dinner; on the second\nday the participants were visited in the morning, and\nblood samples were taken only for those individuals who\nconfirmed they had fasted.\nDiabetes was determined through adding the individuals\nwith self-reported diabetes to those with a fasting blood\nglucose of \u2265 7.0 mmol\/l, following the WHO criteria for\ndiagnosis of glucose intolerance [21].\nData analysis\nBlood pressure was measured twice for each individual\nand mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mmHg was\nseparated into four categories: <120; 120\u2013139; 140\u2013159;\nand \u2265 160. Hypertension in this study was defined as SBP\n\u2265 140 mmHg. Cholesterol levels (mmol\/L) were divided\ninto quartiles (<4.3; 4.3\u20135; 5.1\u20135.8; and >5.8); choles-\nterol \u2265 5 mmol\/L was considered to be high.\nMeasures of obesity included waist circumference, body\nmass index [BMI; weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of the height in meters (kg\/m2)], and waist-to-hip\nratio. Following WHO guidelines, waist circumference\nwas considered to be abnormal \u2265 102 cm for men and \u2265\n88 cm for women; and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was con-\nsidered to be abnormal >0.95 cm for men and >0.85 cm\nfor women. Respondents were classified as overweight if\nBMI \u2265 25 and <30 and obese if BMI \u2265 30.\nThe demographic variables include: age, grouped into 17\nfive-year age bands between 20 and 109 years; sex; and\nmarital status, measured as married or not married\n(including divorced, separated, widowed or never mar-\nried). Whether the individual smoked was also included.\nLevel of education is separated into three groups: illiterate;\nless than secondary school; and secondary school and\nabove. No other available measure of income or socioeco-\nnomic status was available in this survey.\nPlace of residence was used to categorize individuals into\nurban and rural. Those living in Muscat were considered\nto be urban-dwellers, while those residing in the rest of\nthe country were considered to be living in rural areas.\nThe prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, high choles-\nterol, and obesity by region, demographic and educa-\ntional status was measured. Then multiple logistic\nregression analyses were conducted to analyze the signifi-\ncant factors associated with the dependent variable, diabe-\ntes, first in the whole population and then stratified\naccording to region. Independent variables were selected\non the basis of the literature of diabetes risk factors [23].\nDue to the high degree of colinearity between the three\nmeasures of obesity, only waist circumference was chosen\nfor the regression models, as recommended by WHO.\nMost of the variables included within the models are cat-\negorical, thus dummy variables are created. Results are\npresented as crude and adjusted odds ratios with associ-\nated 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were con-\nducted using Stata 8; p-value of <0.05 was considered\nsignificant.\nResults\nTable 2 presents the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol and obesity across the identified inde-\npendent variables. Among the population aged 20 or\nabove, the overall prevalence of diabetes was 11.6% and\nvaried according to urban or rural residence, age, marital\nstatus, educational level, smoking status, measures of\nobesity (BMI, WHR, waist circumference), cholesterol and\nSBP. The prevalence of hypertension (mean SBP \u2265 140\nmmHg), and obesity (BMI \u2265 30) among the adult popula-\ntion were 21.5% and 19.1% respectively. High cholesterolPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPopulation Health Metrics 2006, 4:5 http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5(\u2265 5 mmol\/L) affects more than half of the adult Omani\npopulation.\nFurthermore, diabetes affects a much greater proportion\nof the urban population (17.7%) than rural (10.5%).\nSimilarly, hypertension is more common in urban\n(26.4%) than in rural areas (20.2%). The difference in\nprevalence of obesity in urban areas and rural areas\nappears to be less significant, as with the prevalence of\nhigh cholesterol. A gradient in unstandardized diabetes\nprevalence was also observed with education suggesting\nthat the higher educated individuals were less likely to\nhave diabetes than the illiterate or less educated groups.\nTable 3 shows the variables that are significantly associ-\nated with diabetes, ceteris paribus. Of the 7179 respond-\nents aged 20 or over, 5847 individuals were included in\nthe analysis due to missing data for one or more of the\nvariables. Individuals living in the urban capital region\nwere almost twice as likely to have diabetes as those living\nin the rural areas. Furthermore, advanced age, being\nTable 2: Prevalence (%) of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity by urban residence and selected variables.\nDiabetes \n(n = 676\/5840)\nHypertension \n(n = 1389\/6464)\nCholesterol=5 \n(n = 2974\/5876)\nBMI=30 \n(n = 1224\/6430)\nTotal 11.6 21.5 50.6 19.1\nResidence\nUrban 17.7 26.4 50.0 19.9\nRural 10.5 20.2 50.7 18.8\nAge\n20\u201329 3.6 7.95 32.1 13.4\n30\u201339 8.5 14.5 55.7 24.8\n40\u201349 17.1 25.7 59.4 28.6\n50\u201359 22.6 39.3 69.2 22.2\n\u2265 60 23.1 52.2 71.3 15.0\nSex\nMale 11.8 32.5 50.8 15.5\nFemale 11.3 22.7 50.4 22.2\nMarital status\nMarried 13.2 22.8 55.8 21.6\nNot married 8.0 18.4 39.3 13.5\nEducation level\nIlliterate 17.1 34.7 62.1 19.8\nLess than secondary 10.2 16.9 48.6 20.1\nSecondary or above 5.4 9.9 36.8 16.1\nSmoker\nYes 12.2 25.2 50.3 14.5\nNo 11.5 21.2 50.6 19.4\nBMI (kg\/m2)\n<18.5 6.9 14.7 36.4 -\n18.5\u201324.99 8.1 18.5 44.8 -\n25\u201329.99 14.7 22.6 58.0 -\n\u2265 30 16.5 29.7 58.9 -\nWHR (cm)\nNormal 8.2 16.4 43.9 12.3\nAbnormal (men >0.95; women >85) 15.5 27.3 58.4 26.6\nWaist circumference (cm)\nNormal 9.5 18.5 47.2 7.8\nAbnormal (men = 102; women = 88) 18.1 30.7 61.5 53.2\nCholesterol (mmol\/L)\n<4.3 5.5 13.2 - 12.8\n4.3\u20135 8.0 18.5 - 18.2\n5\u20135.8 12.6 22.8 - 19.8\n\u2265 5.8 17.8 32.9 - 23.5\nSBP (mmHg)\n<120 6.2 - 44.2 12.9\n120\u2013139 9.8 - 47.8 18.8\n140\u2013159 19.6 - 60.9 25.3\n\u2265 160 24.4 - 74.5 28.9\nNote: SBP is systolic blood pressure; BMI is body mass index; WHR is waist-to-hip ratioPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPopulation Health Metrics 2006, 4:5 http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5married, and abnormal waist circumference\nalso increased the odds of diabetes.\nA strong gradient was apparent with SBP: compared to SB\np < 120 mmHg the adjusted OR for diabetes increased\nfrom 1.4 (SBP: 120\u2013139 mmHg) to 1.9 (SBP: 140\u2013159\nmmHg) and decreased to 1.7 (SBP = 160 mmHg). The\nlack of a linear relationship between SBP and diabetes is\nlikely a result of the small sample of individuals in the\nhighest SBP group.\nAfter controlling for the other factors, education was not\nsignificantly associated with diabetes, except with strati-\nfied analyses by region (see Table 4). These stratified anal-\nyses revealed that higher educated individuals,\nparticularly in rural areas, were less likely than illiterate\nindividuals to have diabetes.\nDiscussion\nAs expected with the use of a more accurate categorization\nof urban and rural areas in Oman, residence was found to\nbe a significant independent factor for diabetes similar to\nother epidemiological studies [24,25]. Because the impact\nof urban residence on likelihood of diabetes persisted\nafter adjusting for demographic and educational varia-\nbles, there are some unobserved unique features of urban\npopulations that increase their risk of diabetes. These var-\niables are likely to relate to lifestyle factors or perhaps to\ncharacteristics of employment.\nPossibly explaining the higher prevalence of diabetes in\nthe urban area is the change in dietary patterns, physical\nactivity patterns and lifestyle associated with urbanization\n(which has been taking place to a large extent in the past\n30 years, as witnessed by the increasing migration of\nOmanis to Muscat) [26,27]. Moreover, in the past 30 years\nOman experienced rapid socioeconomic developments\nthat were associated with a sharp rise in car ownership, an\nincrease in consumption of high fat caloric-dense food,\nrefined sugar and salt, and increased rates of smoking\n[28].\nIt is unlikely that the elevated rate of diabetes in the capi-\ntal region is due to lack of awareness or diagnosis among\nrural-dwellers, since the same haematological criteria to\ndetermine diabetes were used for all individuals. Because\nof the lack of available information on income, lifestyle\nfactors such as diet and exercise, household expenditure,\nor socioeconomic status, it is not possible to test whether\nthese factors may help explain the relationship between\nurbanization and diabetes.\nThe results of this study indicate that hypertension is sig-\nnificantly associated with diabetes, particularly among\nurban-dwellers. Also, the prevalence of hypertension is\nhigher in the capital region than the rural areas. These\nfindings are consistent with previous studies [8,13,29-32],\nand indicate that individuals in the capital region are at\nhigher risk for developing both diabetes and cardiovascu-\nlar disease, due to elevated prevalence of coronary risk fac-\ntors, than those in rural regions of Oman.\nAlmost one-fifth of the adult Omani population are\nobese. The past decade has witnessed an increase in the\nrate of obesity and overweight among Omani men, while\na declining trend has been observed among Omani\nwomen [28]. In the urban area, this high prevalence could\nTable 3: Significant factors associated with diabetes (p < 0.05)\nNo diabetes (n = 5164) Diabetes (n = 676) Crude OR (95% CI) Adjusted OR *(95% CI)\nn (%) n (%)\nResidence\nUrban 741 (82.3) 159 (17.7) 1.8 (1.5\u20132.2) 1.7 (1.4 \u2013 2.1)\nRural 4430 (89.6) 517 (10.5) - -\nAge\u00b1 1.2 (1.2\u20131.3) 1.2 (1.1- 1.2)\nMarital status\nNot married 1721 (92.0) 149 (8.0) - -\nMarried 3431 (86.8) 523 (13.2) 1.8 (1.5\u20132.1) 1.4 (1.1\u20131.7)\nWaist circumference (cm)\nNormal 4023 (90.5) 422 (9.5) - -\nAbnormal 1148 (81.9) 254 (18.1) 2.1 (1.8\u20132.5) 1.8 (1.5- 2.1)\nSBP (mmHg)\n<120 1231 (93.8) 81 (6.2) - -\n120\u2013139 2871 (90.2) 311 (9.8) 1.6 (1.3\u20132.1) 1.4 (1.04 \u2013 1.8)\n140\u2013159 751 (80.4) 183 (19.6) 3.7 (2.8\u20134.9) 1.9 (1.4 \u2013 2.6)\n\u2265 160 264 (75.6) 85 (24.4) 4.9 (3.5\u20136.8) 1.7 (1.2 \u2013 2.5)\nNote: SBP is systolic blood pressure. * Odds ratios adjusted for all variables included in the model. \u00b1 Age is grouped into 17 five-year age bands \nbetween 20 and 109 years.

Although higher than among men, the\ndecreasing rate of obesity among women has been\nexplained by increasing educational levels, declining fer-\ntility rates and improved awareness of self-image [28].\nCrude estimates indicate that illiterate and less educated\nindividuals are more likely to suffer from diabetes, high\nblood pressures and high cholesterol. It appears that\nwhen all the other factors are considered, education is not\nindependently associated with diabetes. However, when\nseparate analyses were conducted for urban and rural\nareas, higher educated individuals were less likely to have\ndiabetes particularly in the rural population. This finding\nhas also been demonstrated in Bahrain [29]. It is unclear\nwhether lifestyle characteristics that were not measured in\nthis study, such as exercise and dietary patterns, may be\ndriving the relationship between education and diabetes.\nThus, higher educated individuals may be better aware of\ncoronary risk factors and use more effective preventive\nmeasures.\nFinally, it is important to note that the prevalence of dia-\nbetes defined through blood test in Oman is considerably\nhigher than the self-reported prevalence. Less than half of\nthe number of individuals with diabetes as defined by\nfasting blood glucose reported having diabetes. Indeed\nthe situation is more striking in the urban area of Muscat:\namong the urban population, 11.1% of those who\ndeclared they did not have diabetes actually did according\nto blood tests; compared to only 6.2% among those out-\nside Muscat. This finding highlights the importance of\nhealth education and frequent testing in order to prevent\nindividuals unaware they have diabetes from developing\ncomplications associated with the disease [33], particu-\nlarly in the region of Muscat.\nLimitations\nThis study is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the\ndata, which does not provide any indication of the direc-\ntion of effect or causality. This limitation also prevents any\nmeasure of temporal changes in prevalence of diabetes\nand factors associated with diabetes. Longitudinal studies\nwould serve as a complement to the present study to\ndetermine causality and directional effect of the factors.\nIn addition, the blood test used to diagnose diabetes for\nthis study did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2\ndiabetes. Therefore, the proportion of individuals with\ndiabetes in the lowest age group (3.6%) is likely suffering\nfrom type 1 diabetes. The risk factors associated with the\ntwo types of diabetes are different, with a stronger genetic\ncomponent for type 1, therefore the significance of the\nother factors in the model may be underestimated. Indeed\nin a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded the youngest\nage groups (age 20\u201329) from the analysis, the strength of\nthe association between blood pressure and diabetes\nincreased and the relationship between urbanization and\ndiabetes remained unchanged; however the relationship\nbetween marital status and diabetes disappeared.\nTable 4: Significant factors associated with diabetes in urban and rural areas (p < 0.05) or (p < 0.10)*\nDiabetes in urban areas \n(n = 159)\nDiabetes in rural areas \n(n = 517)\nn (%) Adjusted OR (95% CI) n (%) Adjusted OR (95% CI)\nAge \u00b1 - 1.2 (1.1\u20131.2) 1.2 (1.17\u20131.24)\nMarital status\nNot married 35 (11.1) - 114 (7.3) -\nMarried 120 (20.7) 1.6 (1.0\u20132.3) 403 (11.9) 1.3 (1.0\u20131.7)\nEducational level\nIlliterate 68 (28.0) - 323 (15.6) -\nLess than secondary 43 (12.9) 0.6 (0.4\u20131.0)* 196 (9.8) 1.3 (1.0\u20131.6)\nSecondary or above 43 (14.0) 1.0 (0.6\u20131.7) 32 (3.0) 0.6 (0.4\u20130.9)\nWaist circumference (cm)\nNormal 99 (14.7) - 323 (8.6)\nAbnormal 60 (26.7) 1.5 (1.0\u20132.3) 194 (16.5) 1.9 (1.5\u20132.3)\nSBP (mmHg)\n<120 15 (8.4) 66 (5.8) -\n120\u2013139 59 (13.3) 1.2 (0.7\u20132.3) 252 (9.2) 1.4 (1.0\u20131.8)\n140\u2013159 51 (28.2) 2.7 (1.4\u20135.1) 132 (17.5) 1.7 (1.2\u20132.4)\n\u2265 160 28 (32.6) 2.2 (1.0\u20134.7) 57 (21.7) 1.6 (1.1\u20132.5)\nNote: SBP is systolic blood pressure\n* Odds ratios adjusted for all variables included in the model.\n\u00b1 Age is grouped into 17 five-year age bands between 20 and 109 years.Page 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPopulation Health Metrics 2006, 4:5 http:\/\/www.pophealthmetrics.com\/content\/4\/1\/5Finally, because this study uses secondary data collected\nfor the purpose of the National Health Survey, the use of\nrobust standardization methods of data collection, partic-\nularly important for measures of blood pressure and\nanthropomorphic indicators, were not employed. There-\nfore the potential for minimizing systematic error is lim-\nited.\nConclusion\nThis study highlights the prevalence of diabetes and asso-\nciated coronary risk factors in urban Oman. Public health\npolicy should be directed towards this area with a focus\non primary prevention of diabetes, hypertension and\nobesity by lifestyle interventions.\nAs the relatively young Omani population ages in the\nfuture, there will likely be an escalation in the prevalence\nof diabetes and other chronic diseases. Therefore, it is\nimportant to continually monitor the coronary risk fac-\ntors in Oman, as well as to direct effective public health\ninterventions towards the high risk groups, such as those\nliving in the capital region, individuals with high blood\npressure, and obesity.\nChronic disease research in Oman and other countries in\nthe Gulf region would be improved if national surveys\ncollected more detailed information on reported symp-\ntoms, dietary patterns, physical exercise, and income level.\nThese data would enable further analysis of chronic dis-\neases and thus help to better inform public health policy-\nmakers. Furthermore, a specially designed survey with the\nobjective of determining risk factors of diabetes and cardi-\novascular disease that incorporates robust standardization\nmethods is needed to confirm the findings of the present\nstudy.\nAt this time it is vital to consider the classification of\nurban and rural residence in Oman, and other Middle\nEastern countries, in order to improve analytical studies as\nwell as the consistency and accuracy of data presented by\ninternational organizations.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSiba Al-Moosa conducted the literature review, drafted\nsections, and assisted with statistical analysis.
