[Keywords: social complexity, simulation,\narchaeology, Bronze Age, agent-based models]\nARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES at the level of the siteor the region are increasingly incorporating environ-\nmental change into their operating models. Unfortunately,\nsuch models often fail to fully capture the complexity of\nthe systems under consideration. Effective models need to\nacknowledge a wide range of human factors that incorpo-\nrate realistic mechanisms for subsistence provision, social\ninteractions, regional and international economies, demo-\ngraphic factors, and human contingency. This is a tall or-\nder, and, until recently, such approaches\u2014if they were to\nbe of any quantitative value\u2014were virtually impossible. Al-\nthough it is true that global environmental change does\nhave a significant effect on many dimensions of the sub-\nsistence economy as well as many other aspects of human\nlife, it is by no means the only or even dominant factor.\nThis article uses examples of Bronze Age communities in\na marginal semiarid environment to show how environ-\nmental change can be incorporated into interpretations of\nhuman settlement.

Our group, Modeling Ancient\nSettlement Systems (dubbed the MASS group), consists of re-\nsearchers from the Argonne National Laboratory, the Uni-\nversity of Chicago (Oriental Institute and Department of\nAnthropology), and the University of Durham, together\nwith affiliated colleagues from the private sector and other\nuniversities.\nComplex adaptive systems are not simply complex.\nThey often show a structure that relates not to \u201ctop-down\nprocesses\u201d of control but to the operation of small-scale\nprocesses, which, in aggregate, can result in larger-scale\npatterns or process, often known as \u201cemergent properties\u201d\n(Bentley 2003). As a result, models can produce outcomes or\nstructures that may have been unanticipated at the begin-\nning. As pointed out by Henry Wright, integrating the wide\nrange of subdisciplines that constitute the holistic discipline\nof anthropology can be a daunting task, although it has\nled to elegant, but specific, case studies (Wright 2000:373).\nIn this article, rather than relying on either narrative force\nof argument or conclusive proof of relationships, we use\nagent-based modeling to explore the behavior of small\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 53\ncommunities and their agricultural subsistence systems at\nthe onset of urbanization, operating within a climatically\nmarginal environment.\nUsing the ancient Near Eastern city as a particularly\nwell-documented example of long-term settlement, the\nMASS project is intended to address the following: First,\nhow and why in the third and fourth millennium B.C.E.\ncities in the irrigated zone of southern Mesopotamia grew\nto a greater size and complexity than those in the rain-fed\nnorth; second, what was the dynamic trajectory of such set-\ntlements through time; and third, how did the resultant\ncities respond to a capricious natural environment and how\nwere they able to grow, survive, or decline under various so-\ncial, environmental, and economic stresses? A fundamental\nassumption underlying the original modeling framework\nwas that land-use practices mediate between social groups\nand the environment so that crop productivity is not simply\na function of environmental factors but is also dependent\non numerous human decisions such as the frequency of\ncropping and the availability of crop amendments derived\nfrom pastoral flocks and settlement wastes. Despite their\ncomplexity, for the purposes of modeling, one can resolve\nthe basic ancient economy into three components: staple\nproduction, the wealth or network economy, and pastoral\neconomies (Earle 2002).1 Of these, it is the staple production\n(and, to some degree, the pastoral component) that is most\nreadily modeled in relation to environmental fluctuations.\nAlthough climatic fluctuations must clearly have had\nan impact on human communities by inflicting crop fail-\nures and sometimes famines, the massive scale of cities in\nboth northern and southern Mesopotamia must themselves\nhave contributed significantly to the degradation of the\nenvironment and the depletion of nutrient supplies. Con-\nsequently, the archaeologist who is seeking to understand\nthese societies within the context of global environmen-\ntal change must factor both avenues of change into their\nmodels. The two-way interaction between human commu-\nnities and the environment must therefore have resulted in\na complex array of coevolutionary pathways and nonlinear\nresponses.\nIn both northern and southern Mesopotamia, settle-\nments attained their maximum size during the fourth or\nthird millennium B.C.E. and some experienced a decline in\neither the late third or second millennium B.C.E. (Adams\n1981; Wilkinson 2000a: figure 4). The city\u2013region, in the\nform of the urban center with its subsidiary settlements and\nland-use zones, forms a more appropriate analytical unit\nthan the city itself. Ultimately this framework of analysis\ncan be extended still further to include a much larger in-\nteraction sphere of information and commodity flow than\nthe city\u2013region itself. Within such settlement land\u2013use sys-\ntems, larger centers appear to have grown partly by means\nof positive feedback that resulted in increasing numbers\nof people being attracted to the city through time. Such\ngrowth was then constrained by processes of negative feed-\nback, so that cities appeared not to have exceeded a certain\nsize, especially in the climatically marginal landscapes of\nthe northern fertile crescent (Wilkinson 1994). Neighbor-\ning centers could be expected to grow in a similar manner,\nand a dynamic quasiequilibrium state (but not stasis) may\nhave developed so that a series of semiautonomous \u201ccity\nstates\u201d appeared. Such entities were not stable, however,\nand as archaeological and text-based studies demonstrate,\nthese systems were unstable in the long term and vulnerable\nto abrupt declines as a result of external shocks or internal\nmalfunctions (Adams 2001:354).\nThe extensive literature on early state development in-\ncludes a vigorous processual tradition that examines the\ngrowth and development of Mesopotamian cities and states\n(e.g., Adams 1966; Wright 1994), as well as empirically\ngrounded models that seek to understand some of the fac-\ntors that contribute to urban development and collapse\n(e.g., Blanton 2004; Weiss et al. 1993; Wilkinson 1994).\nSuch studies are easy to critique because they rely either\non the assumption that subsistence systems were to some\ndegree dependent on a limited range of staple crops (Blan-\nton 2004; Wilkinson 1994) or that extreme environmen-\ntal catastrophes acted to precipitate urban\u2014and, indeed,\ndemographic\u2014collapse (Weiss et al. 1993). Hence, Karl\nButzer (1997) tackles the shortcomings of both approaches\nand forcefully argues that early states in the Near East\nformed subsystems within a network of interactions that\nwere sustained by long-term trade, exchange, and informa-\ntion flow, but which could be brought down by the sever-\nance of such processes by shifts in alliances, war, or patterns\nof trade.\nIn the context of Near Eastern states nurtured on rain-\nfed agriculture, it is significant that the process of urban-\nization and settlement nucleation appears to have taken\nplace in the face of a drying climate. As land-use intensity\nincreased as a result of population concentration, system\nfragility must also have increased, so that agricultural sys-\ntems must have been constrained by two factors: soil mois-\nture deficits and increased demand for food from a limited\nagricultural territory (Wilkinson 1997). The dynamics of\nearly state societies therefore entailed a range of interactions\nbetween socioeconomic processes and the environment.\nThe topic of human\u2013environment interactions has\nbeen gaining momentum in recent years as a result of the\nhuge investment in environmental research. Physical sci-\nentists, especially, have examined societal collapse in the\ncontext of palaeoclimatological data, an approach that pro-\nvides results of definitive appearance, couched with a de-\ngree of scientific certainty (e.g., De Menocal 2001) that is\nnot justified by the uncertainty of some of the archaeo-\nlogical data employed. The fragility of such conclusions\nis amplified by the simplified assumptions employed that\nsignificantly underestimate the role of human agency in\nancient economies. However, the effect of humans on the\ncontent of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane can\nbe traced back to approximately 8,000 years BP (Ruddiman\n2003). Clearly if environmental scientists are seeing both\nsignificant impacts by the environment on humans (De\nMenocal 2001) and significant impacts by humans on the\n54 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nenvironment (Ruddiman 2003), there is an obvious need to\ntackle the problem from both directions.\nTo avoid deterministic oversimplifications, and to ac-\ncommodate both physical and social factors, the MASS\nproject draws from a number of disciplines, including eco-\nnomic anthropology, cultural ecology, ecological geogra-\nphy, and economic history (Bayliss-Smith 1982; Dodgshon\n1988; Gallant 1991; Olsson 1988; Parry 1990). Such ap-\nproaches would all benefit from the inclusion of a wide\nrange of variables (social, economic, and environmental)\nthat could be made to interact over long periods of time\nwithin the context of a \u201cvirtual laboratory.\u201d\nAt the level of global change, the MASS project is ex-\namining how selected human communities respond when\nthey are stressed by single or multiple \u201cevents\u201d such as dry\nspells and intense conflicts such as wars, pestilence, and\nso on. We also explore how internal system dynamics can\ninfluence long-term demographic trajectories. In addition,\nthe models factor in the decision-making capacity of indi-\nviduals; this will go some way to counteract the appearance\nthat many models appear to not only average human behav-\nior out but also to discount the role of individual decision-\nmaking processes or idiosyncratic actions.\nA first consideration is to differentiate between various\nsectors of the economy, specifically:\n\u0002 The subsistence economy, which, being based on\ncalorific needs and other physiological requirements, is\nrelatively easy to model. This functionalist approach may\nbe sufficient to model the minimal conditions under\nwhich human life can function, but it clearly fails to\ncapture the richness and complexity of life in human\ncommunities.\n\u0002 The political economy, which includes factors such as\nfeasting, gift exchange, or various forms of symbolic gift\ngiving. Although more difficult to deal with than the sub-\nsistence economy, these factors can be included within\nan agent-based model.\n\u0002 Also forming part of the political economy, factors such\nas trade and exchange, being often external to the ter-\nritory being modeled, are difficult to incorporate into\nmodels because they frequently enlarge system scale\nand therefore system complexity by many orders of\nmagnitude. Additional uncertainties are also incorpo-\nrated because one must be aware of the skepticism that\nsome scholars show regarding large-scale, commercial-\nized trade in remote antiquity. Nevertheless, we consider\nthat it is crucial to include mechanisms of trade and ex-\nchange to some degree.\nTHE APPROACH\nFor this initial simulation, we take a pragmatic approach\nto modeling the development of settlement in the rain-fed\nzone of Upper Mesopotamia.\n\u0002 First we select an existing settlement landscape-system\nfor which we can estimate population, cultivated area,\nand so forth. (In this case, we use a tell of some 17 ha\narea, located within an archaeological landscape that has\nalready been mapped.)\n\u0002 Next, we set up a demographic model based on the\nassumption that the community was responsible for\nits own food production, agricultural production being\nbased on agreed parameters derived from input data from\narchaeology, cuneiform texts, and ethnographic factors.\n\u0002 A simulation is then run using existing climate proxy\nsequences, climate generated from a Markov process\nweather generator, or a Global Climate Model, which\ndrives the crop production system, in conjunction with\na selected range of social factors.\n\u0002 The simulation then demonstrates how the pattern of\nland use evolves through time as the population changes,\nand it supplies basic output data on the changing de-\nmography, nutrient balance of the soils, and other\nparameters.\nSuch a settlement land\u2013use system can then be scaled up\nto comprise a pattern of settlement that includes commu-\nnities that develop and interact with each other over many\ncenturies or possibly even millennia.\nBecause it is easier to model, we initially employ cli-\nmatic data as the external variable, but the modeling frame-\nwork is explicitly constructed to actively incorporate chang-\ning social, political, and economic\u2014as well as chance\u2014\nfactors. Although the model may not be able to accommo-\ndate every permutation of circumstances, it is more broad\nbased than most deterministic models and it should even-\ntually provide an ideal laboratory for examining human\u2013\nenvironmental systems over long periods of time.\nTHE RAIN-FED NORTH\nThe \u201cnorthern model\u201d takes into account the wide range\nof processes that operate within complex economies when\nthey interact with the environment.2 Variables such as fal-\nlow; availability of manure, dung, or wood for fuel; feed for\ndraft animals; plant temper for mud bricks; and of course\nlabor all contribute to the mix to make responses to en-\nvironmental \u201cevents\u201d either blurred or unpredictable. Our\nmodel will (amongst others) consider the following factors:\n\u0002 Fallowing regime. Biennial fallow is considered to be the\nnormal means of cultivating staple crops. This allows nu-\ntrients to accumulate, counteracts the build up of pests,\nand conserves moisture. Annual cultivation (\u201cviolation\nof fallow\u201d) results in increased gross production but in\nthe long term can cause increased cropping instability\n(Wilkinson 1997).\n\u0002 Secondary products. Staple crops supply, in addition to\nhuman food, chaff or cereal stalks as animal feed (esp.\ndraft animals) and temper for mud brick. These inject an\nelement of competition between different consumption\nsectors.\n\u0002 Fuel use. When wood provides the fuel needs of a com-\nmunity, animal dung is available for fertilizer, but when\nwood resources have been exhausted, dung will be burnt\nfor fuel and the burnt dung must then be applied to\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 55\nfields as fertilizer. As population increases, fertilizer will\nbe more in demand, but there may be less available be-\ncause of competition for organic residues and manure\nto meet the needs of the population for both fuel and\nfertilizer.\n\u0002 Trends in animal or flock usage and changing size of an-\nimal holdings per households.\n\u0002 Exchange of staple crops and animals between house-\nholds and other sectors of the community.\n\u0002 Changing availability of labor, depending on family size\nand the availability of able bodies to contribute to the\nlabor pool.\n\u0002 Storage and withdrawals from reserves to allow for feast-\ning, temple offerings, and so forth.\n\u0002 Demographic and social factors such as marriage pat-\nterns, within and outside the kinship group.\nThe economies being modeled do not represent subsistence\nagriculture; rather, they incorporate processes such as the\nproduction of staple crops (the primary means of basic sus-\ntenance), rearing domesticated animals, various degrees of\nexchange, as well as tribute, gift exchange, trade, and plun-\nder (although the degree to which formal markets were\nin operation is still debated). In addition to biennial fal-\nlow, the environment of northern Syria and Iraq offers a\nrange of choices of land use, therefore land-use strategies\nincorporate a range of human choices and inheritance prac-\ntices. The resultant evolution of land-use practices from\nbiennial fallow can eventually produce a wide range of\noutcomes.\nTHE SOCIAL FOUNDATION: THE PATRIMONIAL\nHOUSEHOLD MODEL\nThe basic \u201cagent\u201d employed in the present model is the\npatriarchal household, which is well attested as the funda-\nmental social and economic unit in the ancient Near East\n(Schloen 2001). Textual evidence shows that many kinds of\ncommon action and shared interests on the part of supra-\nhousehold groups were symbolized in terms of member-\nship in the same patriarchal household. The metaphori-\ncal extension of household terminology to various polit-\nical, economic, and religious groups was possible because\nlarger social groups (including entire kingdoms and em-\npires) were thought of as consisting of many hierarchi-\ncally nested households subsumed within an overarching\n\u201chousehold\u201d headed by a \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201cfather\u201d (ultimately\nthe king or a god). This recursive pattern, replicating the\nsame familiar household structure at many different scales\nof measurement, conforms to the notion of \u201cfractal\u201d self-\nsimilarity characteristic of the global order of complex adap-\ntive systems.\nBRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT IN THE JAZIRA: THE CASE\nOF TELL BEYDAR\nThe rolling steppe of northern Iraq and Syria (see Figure 1)\nis scattered with numerous prominent mounds of varying\nsize, up to 30 meters or more in height. Most of this region\nfalls between 200 and 600 meters above sea level. Rain-\nfall decreases from around 700 millimeters per annum in\nthe northwest to around 150 millimeters per annum in\nthe south along the Euphrates. The predominant form of\ncrop husbandry remains rain-fed cultivation of wheat and\nbarley. In the wetter areas to the north and west, there\nis increased cultivation of lentils, vines, olives, and even\nnuts, whereas toward the south and east, barley cultivation\npredominates. Although the conventional limit of rain-fed\ncultivation is between 250 and 200 millimeters per an-\nnum, cultivation of cereals can extend further south, es-\npecially where rainfall and soil moisture is concentrated\nalong wadis (Jas 2000:249\u2013251). Toward the south, where\nbarley becomes the main cereal crop, pastoralism, perhaps\nwith some seasonal cultivation, becomes the viable option\n(Wachholtz 1996), although the pasturing of flocks is im-\nportant throughout the region.\nThe patterns of nucleated tell-based settlement, which\nstarted to develop in the fourth through sixth millenniums\nB.C.E., attained a maximum scale in the third millennium\nB.C.E., after which there was a period of settlement de-\nvolution and collapse that took place in the final part of\nthe third millennium or the second millennium B.C.E. Be-\ncause of the marginal nature of the climate, it is tempting\nto equate the settlement collapse variously dated between\n2400 and 2000 B.C.E. as resulting from episodes of dry cli-\nmate, which resulted in shortfalls in the production of sta-\nple crops and associated famines and population collapse\n(Weiss et al. 1993). Anomalies in the pattern of settlement\nwhereby certain settlements remained occupied or even\ngrew despite their location in dry marginal areas (e.g., Tells\nSweyhat, Brak, and Mozan)\u2014or, alternately, whereby oth-\ners collapsed despite their location in relatively moist areas\n(e.g., Hamoukar)\u2014suggests that the picture might be more\ncomplicated.\nHere we use archaeological and landscape surveys com-\nbined with data from cuneiform texts to reconstruct the lo-\ncal economy and demography of a group of settlements in\nnorthern Syria. We then employ techniques of agent-based\nmodeling to show how a similar system might respond to\nselected stress events.\nThe Archaeological Data Set: The Tell Beydar Survey\nThe case study region is an area of 12 kilometers radius (452\nkm2) around Tell Beydar, a regional center of the mid\u2013 to late\nthird millennium B.C.E., located in an area of steppe receiv-\ning circa 300 millimeters mean annual rainfall per annum.\nThe Tell Beydar Survey (TBS; Wilkinson 2000b, 2002) recov-\nered 82 sites, of which 15 were permanently occupied in\nthe mid\u2013 to late third millennium, providing a total of 62.1\nhectares of settled area in the mid\u2013 to late-third millennium\nB.C.E. Tell Beydar (ancient Nabada within the kingdom of\nTell Brak, ancient Nagar) occupies the apex of the TBS settle-\nment hierarchy with a total occupied area of 22.5 hectares,\nof which 17.0 hectares were settled. Three sites were clus-\ntered in the range of seven to nine hectares (Effendi, Hassek,\nand Farfara), and four around 2.5 to four hectares. At the\n56 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 1. Third millennium B.C.E. sites with survey areas in Northern Mesopotamia.\nbase of the hierarchy were seven small villages or hamlets,\nall less than two hectares.\nThe Reconstruction of Ancient Agricultural Systems\nfor the Tell Beydar Area\nSustaining areas provide estimates of the land required\nto feed the estimated site population (Adams 1981:90\u201394;\nStein and Wattenmaker 1990). Because they assume unifor-\nmity of the surrounding soils and are based on population\nestimates derived from site area, they provide an oversim-\nplified estimate of cropping capabilities and population.\nMoreover, they assume subsistence requirements only,\nand they neglect the demands from feasting, passing trade\ncaravans, visits from royalty, and other related factors.\nInitial attempts at estimating Early Bronze Age cultiva-\ntion combined sustaining areas with a land-use intensity\nfactor. Onsite population density as derived from modern\nand historical ethnographic analogies is generally assumed\nto have been between 100\u2013200 persons per hectare, whereas\nthe land-use intensity factor is the field area needed to sup-\nport a single person for a year, this being approximately one\nhectare for the area in question.3\nFigure 2a shows that there is little overlap of sustaining\nareas, except if population density was as high as 200 per-\nsons per hectare. Note that the estimated areas of Beydar\nand several other sites include cultivation on the western\npart of the basalt plateau, an area of thin unproductive soils\nthat probably would have been an uncultivated pastoral\nzone in the Early Bronze Age. This area, therefore, should\nbe excluded from the final estimates.\nAn Archaeologically Derived Cross-Check:\nHollow-way Catchments\nHollow ways, which form depressions with associated soil\nand vegetation marks 50\u2013100 meters wide, are interpreted\nas the surviving traces of former tracks that either radiated\nfrom early Bronze Age sites or connected selected sites. Sig-\nnificantly, these hollow ways are mainly associated with\ntells and occur on the cultivable plain. Only rarely do they\noccur on lands of lesser value for cultivation such as the\nbasalt steppe, which provides support for the notion that\nhollow ways were indeed part of the agricultural landscape.\nThey are assumed to have conveyed human and animal traf-\nfic from settlements to fields and to the pasture areas beyond\n(Van Liere and Lauffray 1954\u201355; Wilkinson 1993; Ur 2003).\nHollow ways often appear to fade out at around three to five\nkilometers from the site, and such zones are inferred to rep-\nresent the point at which fields no longer constrain traffic.\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 57\nFIGURE 2. The immediate area of Tell Beydar with (A) estimated site-sustaining areas and (B) inferred cultivation from hollow ways.\nTherefore, by connecting the terminal ends of the hollow\nways, one can infer the boundary between the cultivated\nand pasture zones (Wilkinson 1993; see Figure 2b). This pro-\ncess involves differentiating hollow ways that served traffic\nto and from fields from intersite hollow ways; only the for-\nmer were used to derive hollow-way catchments.\nA Textually Derived Cross-Check: Plow Team\nAssignments\nIn the years 1993 to 2002, 216 cuneiform clay tablets dated\nto around 2400 B.C.E. (Early Dynastic IIIb) were unearthed\nat Tell Beydar (Ismail et al. 1996; Milano et al. 2004). Most\nwere discovered in the \u201cMaison aux Tablettes\u201d in the resi-\ndential Area B of the site. Almost all of the tablets, which\nwere mainly administrative texts, concern various aspects\nof farming and grain management, labor, or animal hus-\nbandry.\nOne of the texts (Ismail et al. 1996: n. 3; see also Widell\n2005) gives the number of plow animals used in Beydar\nas well as the number of draft animals allocated to six\nsmaller settlements around the site. Ethnographic studies\nhave demonstrated that oxen and donkeys are used in dual\ntraction for plowing in Syria (see Widell 2005). According\nto the Beydar text, 33.5\u201338.5 teams of oxen and 44 teams\nof donkeys were utilized to till the fields directly attached\nto Beydar. The surrounding satellites would together have\nhad 22\u201325.5 teams of oxen and 13 teams of donkeys. Note\nthat these smaller settlements appear to have had better\n(stronger) teams at their disposal than Beydar itself. The\nhigher proportions of oxen in the teams of the satellites\nmay be an indication of less-favorable plowing conditions\nin these areas or perhaps the greater availability of donkeys\nat Beydar.\nObservations from the northern parts of Jordan in the\narea around Irbid have provided data on the daily tillage\ncapacity of plowing teams using the traditional symmetri-\ncal ard (Palmer 1998; Palmer and Russell 1993). Because the\npresent environmental conditions of the area around Irbid\nare rather similar to those of the Upper Khabur (see Duwayri\n1985:140), these data can be used to make a rough estima-\ntion of the daily tillage capacity of the Beydar teams. The\ndata show that a team of oxen is able to till 0.3\u20130.4 hectares\nper day (8\u201310 hours), whereas a team of donkeys manage\n0.2\u20130.3 hectares per day.\nStudies of modern planting seasons in northern Syria\nand Jordan suggest that most grain in the subsistence econ-\nomy of Tell Beydar was planted in November and December,\nand we estimate the entire plowing and sowing season to\naround 60 days (Widell 2005). If heavy rain sets in during\nthe day, work is discontinued and must wait until the fields\ndry. Therefore, we have chosen to reduce the annual plow-\ning season by a minimum of five and a maximum of 15\ndays because of rainfall. This would mean that the ancient\nfarmers of Beydar had 45\u201355 available plowing and sowing\n58 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\ndays (i.e., 50 \u00b1 5). (It should be immediately obvious that\nthe insertion of such arbitrary figures is rendered unnec-\nessary by the agent-based modeling techniques discussed\nbelow.) The planting of winter crops in Syria requires two\nplowings; consequently, the maximum area of cultivated\nfields a plow team can cover will be roughly half of its actual\ntillage capacity. Thus, the total cultivated area for a given\nnumber of plow teams can be estimated with the following\nequation:\nCultivated Area (ha) = (Plow teams * Daily tillage capac-\nity) * (50 \u00b1 5) \/ 2\nUsing this equation with the estimates of the daily\ntillage capacity of the teams in our text, the area of cul-\ntivated fields directly attached to Beydar can be recon-\nstructed to approximately 424\u2013787 hectares, while the to-\ntal tilled areas of the satellites around the site amounted\nto around 207\u2013388 hectares. Using our land-use intensity\nfactor of one (see above and n. 3), the area cultivated\naround Beydar would feed a population of 848\u20131,573 in-\nhabitants and the surrounding satellites would feed another\n414\u2013776 people. Together, these figures presumably con-\nstitute the total agricultural area required to feed the en-\ntire population of Tell Beydar. This suggests that this total\npopulation\u2014amounting to 1,262\u20132,350 people if resident\nat Tell Beydar\u2014would give a total population density of 74\u2013\n138 persons per hectare.\nAssuming that the standard biennial fallow regime was\nused in the particular year of our text, the total areas of\narable land would amount to around 848\u20131,573 hectares for\nBeydar and approximately 414\u2013776 hectares for the satel-\nlites. To the arable land we must add a certain amount of\nwasteland that was either unsuitable or unavailable for cul-\ntivation and therefore not tilled. If we estimate that waste-\nland comprised 25 percent of the total agricultural area\n(Van Driel 1999\u20132000:85, n. 30), the cultivated fields, fallow\nfields, and wastelands around Beydar (i.e., the area covered\nby the radial system of hollow ways around the site) would\ntogether amount to approximately 1,131\u20132,097 hectares.\nSynthesis of Methods\nThe population-derived sustaining areas for Beydar at 100\nto 150 persons per hectare (2,267\u20133,400 ha if we include 25\npercent wasteland) coincide rather well with the area esti-\nmates of cultivated land, fallow, and waste of 1,683 to 3,132\nhectares as derived from the cuneiform records of plow ani-\nmals for Beydar and its surrounding settlements (see below).\nHowever, the sustaining-area estimate that assumes 200 per-\nsons per hectare would have been too great for the quantity\nof plow animals. From the point of view of the textually\nbased cross-check, a population density at Beydar of greater\nthan 150 persons per hectare would not have been sustain-\nable without the importation of agricultural products (see\nFigure 3).\nThe convergence of the data on a common territorial\nlimit of roughly two to three kilometers radius provides a\nuseful reconstruction of the agricultural landscape of early\nFIGURE 3. Sustaining areas and cultivation (with waste and fal-\nlow) estimated from plow teams and hollow-way catchments.\nBronze Age Tell Beydar. Nevertheless, by using averaging\nmethods that only deal with an assumed maximum extent\nof the settlement and land-use system, we fail to capture\nhuman behavior as well as evolutionary changes in land\nuse or households. More pragmatically, few archaeological\nprojects can muster three avenues for the estimates of set-\ntlement territories and associated carrying capacities, which\nwould make these techniques of limited application.\nCOMPUTER SIMULATION PILOT STUDIES\nFOR TELL BEYDAR\nOverview of Computer Simulation Approach\nA pivotal component of the MASS group\u2019s research effort is\nthe development of a powerful new agent-based computer\nsimulation engine that can represent the dynamics of com-\nplex scenarios in which diverse natural and social processes\noperate and interact across a broad range of spatial and tem-\nporal scales. This simulation engine, dubbed \u201cENKIMDU,\u201d\nis intended to serve as an open framework within which re-\nsearchers can explore alternative model formulations and\nhypotheses. In addition, they can observe their models\u2019\nperformance, sensitivities, and any interactions and feed-\nbacks with other simulated processes, in a holistic, multi-\ndisciplinary, simulation environment.\nThe development of the ENKIMDU system has been\nsupported by advanced modeling and simulation tech-\nnologies developed at Argonne National Laboratory. One\nsuch enabling technology is Argonne\u2019s DIAS (Dynamic\nInformation Architecture System; see Christiansen 2000b),\na generic, object-based, computer-simulation framework,\nwhich makes it feasible to manipulate complex simulation\nscenarios in which many thousands of objects can interact\nvia dozens to hundreds of concurrent dynamic processes.\nIn addition to the DIAS system, the FACET (Framework for\nAddressing Cooperative Extended Transactions) framework\nprovides a facility for constructing flexible and expressive\nagent-based object models of social behavior patterns (see\nChristiansen 2000a). By using FACET models to implement\nsocial behaviors of individuals and organizations within\nthe context of larger DIAS-based natural systems simula-\ntions, we can conveniently address a broad range of issues\ninvolving interaction and feedback among natural and\nsocial processes.\nThe ENKIMDU simulations for the Beydar study address\nnatural processes (weather, crop growth, hydrology, soil\nevolution, population dynamics, etc.) and societal processes\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 59\n(farming and herding practices, kinship-driven behaviors,\ntrade, etc.), interweaving on a daily basis across multi-\ndecadal to multigenerational runs. Software objects repre-\nsenting the salient components of the simulation domain\nare resolved and modeled at the level of individual persons\nand households, individual agricultural fields, and individ-\nual herd animals. This fine temporal resolution and fine\ngranularity in resolving the objects and agents in the sim-\nulation domain is essential to our bottom-up modeling ap-\nproach, with its search for higher-order structure as emer-\ngent behavior of an ecology of simpler households. Each of\nthe decision-making \u201cagents\u201d in the simulation domain\u2014\neach person, household, or other organization\u2014governs its\nown behavior in the simulations based on its own local rules\nand in response to its own perceptions, preferences, capa-\nbilities, and goals.\nThe Mesopotamian simulation domain (see Figure 4)\nshows the major classes of entity (Field, Household, etc.)\nin the center of the figure; modeled dynamic behaviors of\nthese simulation entities in the bulleted lists are indicated\nwithin each entity block. These entity behaviors are im-\nplemented by the ensemble of simulation models (shad-\nowed blocks at the margins of the figure). The simulation\nsoftware includes both custom-built models created by the\nMASS team and existing, off-the-shelf models that repre-\nsent some of the key dynamic behaviors needed to support\nour dynamic \u201cvirtual ancient Mesopotamia\u201d model. One\noff-the-shelf model employed within the modeling frame-\nwork is the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Soil and Water\nAssessment Tool (SWAT) simulator (see Arnold and Allen\n1992; Arnold et al. 1998). Processes addressed by the SWAT\nsystem include hydrology at individual field to watershed\nscale, daily agricultural weather, soil evolution and ero-\nsion, nutrient cycling dynamics, vegetation growth, grazing\nand browsing by livestock, and various effects of human\nintervention\u2014such as tillage (leveling, plowing, planting,\nharrowing, harvesting, etc.) and irrigation.\nSimulated interactions between natural and societal\nprocesses within the ENKIMDU framework may occur in\nmany forms and modes. For example, Figure 5 depicts the\nflow of information characterizing the natural and soci-\netal process activity, which affects a simulation software\nobject representing a single agricultural field. Figure 5 in-\ndicates that modeled natural processes can induce changes\nin the state of the Field object, as can the anthropogenic\nimpacts associated with modeled agricultural and pastoral\nactivities. In turn, because the current and subsequent\nstates of the Field object help drive the dynamics of other\nprocesses, natural process signals can easily propagate to\naffect societal processes, and vice versa. Two examples\nillustrate this point:\n\u2022 A household\u2019s work crew harvests a portion of the bar-\nley crop in a field today. As a result, the standing biomass\non the field is reduced and the surface litter is increased,\nleading to modeled changes in the field\u2019s soil temperature\nprofile, rate of evapotranspiration, and crop phenologi-\ncal growth trajectory, among other factors. In turn, the\nstate of the crop observed by the work crew influences\nthe household\u2019s crop management decisions.\n\u2022 A shepherd leads a flock of sheep and goats belonging\nto multiple households onto a section of pastureland to-\nday. The livestock remove some standing biomass by for-\naging, trample more of it into surface litter, and fertilize\nthe remainder by dropping manure. The subsequent com-\nplex effects of this pastoral operation on the landscape are\nmodeled explicitly and result in locally altered soil, mois-\nture, and vegetation state, which can be observed by the\nhouseholds and used to help to inform their decisions\nregarding continuing pasturage, breaking the fallow to\nplant a crop, and so on.\nThe patrilineal household serves as the principal class of\nsocial agent in our Bronze Age Mesopotamian simulations.\nBecause so much of the adaptive behavior of our simulated\ncommunities is the result of household-level processes and\ninteractions, we examine the ENKIMDU modeling repre-\nsentation of the household in more detail.\nModeled Household Demographics and\nSocial Structure\nThe simulation system includes mechanisms for the con-\nstruction of demographic and household components that\nare needed to characterize the population. From medieval\nand ancient demographic data in the Mediterranean re-\ngion, we can estimate demographic trends in the preindus-\ntrial Mediterranean world (Bagnall and Frier 1994; Herlihy\nand Klapisch-Zuber 1985). These data match closely Ans-\nley Coale and Paul Demeny\u2019s model life tables (Model West\nLevels 2 and 4 for females and males, respectively), enabling\nus to create demographic algorithms that can produce our\nmodel settlement\u2019s general demographic data (Coale and\nDemeny 1966). Names and individuals\u2019 reference numbers\ncan be randomly created and used to trace family history\nthroughout a simulation run. Individuals are also made\naware of their interconnections with kin members, enabling\nlineage networks to be utilized for a variety of kin-based\nsocial behaviors.\nFor the present model, we consider that social interac-\ntions in Bronze Age Mesopotamia occurred primarily at the\nhousehold level, with household heads making decisions af-\nfecting many or all the household members (Blanton 1994;\nSchloen 2001; Stone 1981). In the present simulation, indi-\nviduals are assigned to households and certain resources and\nlabor are cooperatively shared within a given household. In\naddition, census data from rural Ptolemaic Egypt can be\nused to initially reconstruct the percentages of household\ntypes potentially encountered (Bagnall and Frier 1994).\nModeled basic household types are those found in the an-\ncient Near East, including single person, nonfamily or un-\nrelated members, nuclear, extended, and multiple-family\nhouseholds. Households can evolve dynamically, changing\ntype and structure, within ENKIMDU simulations. Gener-\nally, patrilocal, multiple-family households may have been\npreferred; however, social stress and mortality rates may\nhave prevented many households from achieving their\nideal (Schloen 2001).\n60 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 4. Simulation entities and dynamic behavior models for a Bronze Age Mesopotamian simulation framework.\nBehaviors and decisions of households are also influ-\nenced by natural and social circumstances such as low crop\nyields, endogamous or exogamous marriage patterns, and\nhigh rates of death. Economic exchanges and transfers, such\nas bride price and dowry, reflect some of the behavioral traits\nassociated with the marriage patterns in our present simu-\nlations (Holy 1989). For now, such exchanges of goods are\nlimited to grain and field shares, but economic exchange\nis being developed as a household-based behavior to utilize\nkin and non-kin relationships (see below). Labor activities\nare organized at the household level, as is often the case in\nboth ancient sources and ethnographies (Gelb 1979; Sweet\n1974).\nHousehold and kinship affiliations (e.g., collateral kins-\nmen) are key drivers and modulators of social relationships\nand interactions in the simulations. Thus, strengths of so-\ncial and kinship ties are important in creating behavioral\noptions for the agent households. In the current model\nruns, kin-related households can be called on in many\ncases to help alleviate a household\u2019s economic stress. How-\never, households that provide economic support to other\nhouseholds may increase their influence on the commu-\nnity through patronage (Saller 1994; Schloen 2001). In the\nsimulation, such mechanisms may result in the emergence\nof elites and political leaders.\nAgricultural Practices and Activities\nNearly all households have access to cropland. Depending\non the form of land tenure chosen for a simulation, fields\ncan either be owned outright by individual households or\n(as in the current simulation) can be administrated under\na musha\u2019 system. In musha\u2019, fields can be held as a com-\nmunity resource to be assigned annually to households by\nlottery, with each household receiving the use of cropland\nin proportion to the number of (inheritable) field shares\nthat the household holds within the community (Granott\n1952). Households that have the capacity to plant a grain\ncrop will generally do so. Households plan and conduct agri-\ncultural activities with the goal of overproducing if possible\nso as to leave a safety margin. Within the agricultural year,\nsimulated households must clear and level each field, and\nthen plow, sow, weed and maintain, and harvest it. The la-\nbor and other resources required vary with the task (Gallant\n1991; Russell 1988) and with the local context (e.g., it takes\nlonger to plow a field if it is necessary to break fallow). Once\nharvest has commenced, the household\u2019s labor force must\npursue the parallel tasks of processing the harvest: stack-\ning, threshing, winnowing, and so forth. The sequences of\ndaily crop-field management tasks are represented in detail\nwithin the ENKIMDU system\u2019s agricultural process models.\nPastoral Practices and Activities\nPastoralism was a major component of many ancient\neconomies in the Near East, and this can be seen at Tell Bey-\ndar (Van Lerberghe 1996). Sheep and goats were often the\nmain livestock and were not only important for their nutri-\ntional value but also for their secondary products, such as\nleather and wool (Zeder 1991). We simulate key aspects of\npastoral behavior and allow agent households the option\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 61\nFIGURE 5. Modeling representation of a nexus for natural and social process interaction: An agricultural field.\nto consider disposition of their livestock assets in making\neconomic choices.\nTo address the natural systems side of pastoralism, the\nsimulation framework presently models individual sheep\nand goat physiology and reproductive attributes, meat\nquantity at time of slaughter, and milk produced per day, as\nwell as rates of biomass consumption and rates of manure\nexcretion (Blaxter 1967; Redding 1981). This representation\nof the livestock component allows the simulation to assess\npositive (added manure to the soils) and negative (overgraz-\ning) impacts on the local environment by managed herds\nand flocks.\nOn the societal side, the ENKIMDU system represents\nthe flow of daily pastoral tasks such as herding and grazing\nthe animals in the surrounding landscape, selecting new\npastures, splitting or merging herds, and so on. Appropri-\nate ranges of social behavior for households undertaking\nthese tasks can, to some degree, be estimated from ethno-\ngraphic sources in the Near East. From such ethnographies,\nit appears that households had private holdings of domes-\nticated fauna; however, daily grazing herds were formed as\ncooperatives between different households (Stirling 1965;\nSweet 1974). Presently, the simulation framework allows co-\noperative herds to be formed by several households using\nkin-based relations or by other social relationships.\nClearly, social behavior in managing livestock herds\ncan vary, particularly between modern and ancient settled\ncommunities; therefore, many social practices in manag-\ning domesticated animals can be made to differ depending\non the agent household\u2019s circumstances or desires. For ex-\nample, in ENKIMDU at present, sheep and goats are only\nslaughtered for marriage feasts or famine relief; however, if\nhouseholds herds are too large (larger than 25 animals per\nhousehold) then excess livestock are slaughtered periodi-\ncally for food, with males being the first choice of slaughter.\nHousehold Stress-coping Mechanisms and\nEconomic Exchange\nDepending on their circumstances, households have a va-\nriety of coping mechanisms available to them for dealing\n62 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 6. Modeled household food-stress coping mechanisms.\nwith periods of social or environmental stress. For instance,\nthe formation of multiple-family households (sharing\nresources among related members) and livestock manage-\nment (e.g., slaughtering animals in times of food stress)\nwould have been among a range of possible options for\ndealing with periods of food stress (Gallant 1991; Redding\n1981; Schloen 2001). Other coping mechanisms for stress-\nful circumstances in the present simulation framework in-\nclude collecting nondomesticated food sources (i.e., hunt-\ning and famine foods) and harvesting household gardens\n(Sweet 1974), as well as several forms of exchange of com-\nmodities among households. Emigration was usually the\nlast option. The household food-stress coping mechanisms\nrepresented in the current ENKIMDU simulation framework\nare shown in Figure 6.\nThe current simulation allows people to choose to leave\ntheir community, as a last-ditch coping response to be taken\nwhen all other options are exhausted. In the near future,\nwhen we model multiple settlements within a region, we\nwill integrate a representation of nomadic behavior into the\nsimulation framework. At that point, simulated households\nwill have sufficient context to be able to elect to emigrate to\nanother settlement or adopt a nomadic lifestyle to improve\ntheir situation rather than simply as a last resort.\nIn the present modeling framework, exchange among\nhouseholds occurs in three forms: food gifts among close\nkin, small-scale trading of commodities (e.g., livestock for\ngrain) at fixed rates of exchange, and grain loans. House-\nholds can look to better-off kin members for food gifts\nin times of economic stress. Such assistance is mostly\nin the form of gifts, with more distant kin offering\nless \u201cfrictionless\u201d gifts (Netting 1968; Sweet 1974). How-\never, households must look beyond their kin members\nif consanguine relations are also stressed beyond the\npoint where assistance is feasible. Stressed households can\nattempt mitigating measures such as borrowing grain (due\nwith interest after the next harvest) or selling livestock\nfor grain outside of their kin networks. Such options are\nattested in cuneiform sources from the third millennium\nB.C.E. (Garfinkle 2004). Mutually beneficial exchanges\namong non-kin household agents can create or strengthen\nsocial bonds that can be used outside of kin-based networks\nin decision processes. For instance, non-kin bonds can sup-\nport a \u201csafety net\u201d of households that may assist stressed\nhouseholds when the primary kin-based support network\nis inadequate.\nAt present, modeled interhousehold exchanges are\ndriven primarily by need: simulated households seeking re-\nlief from food stress. Even in these limited exchange condi-\ntions, simulated households may begin to stratify by wealth\nto some degree as the more successful (more productive)\nhouseholds are able to make favorable exchanges with other\nheavily stressed households.\nSimulation Results for the Beydar-Type Settlement\nFigure 7 illustrates the spatial layout for simulations of the\nBeydar settlement. The modeled field layout, though algo-\nrithmically created, approximates the texture of field mo-\nsaics inferred from the landscape studies (above). \u201cBaseline\u201d\nmodeling assumptions and parameterizations are noted in\nthe figure.\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 63\nFIGURE 7. Spatial layout and initial conditions for Beydar settlement simulations.\nThe ENKIMDU simulation framework that gener-\nated these results is a work-in-progress, lacking robust\nrepresentations of many social- and natural-system dy-\nnamic mechanisms, which we intend to incorporate. Thus,\nthe model output shown here is intended to illustrate the\nsort of questions that can be addressed and to hint at the\ninsights that may be obtainable.\nWe now present results from a 100-year baseline sce-\nnario simulation and from some variant scenarios. The vari-\nants are intended to illustrate effects on settlement sustain-\nability of both chronic and episodic stresses stemming from\nboth natural and societal causes.\nOne Hundred Year Baseline Results\nFigure 8 presents the aggregated demographic results for\nthe settlement across the 100-year span of the baseline sim-\nulation. Total population rises about 14 percent, from 501\ninitially to 569 at the end of 100 years, after peaking at 639\npeople, 38 years into the run. Over that same period, the\nnumber of households increased 30 percent, from 99 to 129,\nwith a peak of 144 households occurring in the 46th year.\nTotal settlement births and deaths over the 100-year\ntime span were 3,250 and 2,683, respectively. If the settle-\nment had been a completely closed system, there would\nhave been the potential for a doubling (at least) of the\npopulation, assuming that the agricultural capacity of the\nsettlement catchment could support that number. How-\never, the modeled system is not completely closed; over\nthe course of the run, 499 people\u2014about five per year\u2014\nemigrated from the settlement, thus leaving the simulation\ncompletely. There is no external flow of persons into the set-\ntlement for our baseline scenario (this will be implemented\nwhen we move to regional, multisettlement simulations),\nso the settlement\u2019s net population increase is more modest.\nIt should be noted that emigrations are not necessarily\nan indication of sustainability failure of the settlement\nas a whole. Rather, it is a reflection of a highly localized\ncondition: that of a household that cannot command\nthe resources to sustain itself, even factoring in the aid of\ngifts from close kin, exchanges with non-kin, or loans of\ngrain. Model results indicate that such occurrences are not\nunusual, even when the settlement as a whole appears to\nbe thriving.\nFigure 9 shows the simulated settlement\u2019s annual av-\nerage barley yield in the context of the annual rainfall.\nAs would be expected, the two parameters are correlated\u2014\nalthough at +0.23 the correlation coefficient is weak. The\nFIGURE 8. 100-Year baseline run: Total population and number of\nhouseholds.\n64 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 9. 100-Year baseline run: Barley yield and precipitation.\nsimulated village practiced biennial fallowing, and there\nwas no intercropping with species other than barley. No\nsupplemental water was applied to crops, and no manure\nwas applied to fields other than through the agency of the\nsettlement\u2019s livestock foraging on the fallow fields.\nThe results in Figure 9 reflect daily updates to the state\nof each of the 337 fields in the modeled settlement\u2019s sur-\nround, for 100 years of simulation: Thus, over 12 million\ndaily field-state updates are incorporated in the yield results.\nFigure 10 illustrates the relationship between the sim-\nulated settlement\u2019s total grain production and its total food\nconsumption over the 100 years of the baseline run. In gen-\neral the settlement appears to be producing a comfortable\ngrain surplus. This tentative conclusion is reinforced by the\nfact that grain is not the only food consumed: Produce,\nmeat, and dairy products make up roughly 25 percent of\nthe diet of our simulated citizens. However, stored grain is\nlost to spoilage at a significant rate, and grain is also needed\nas seed for subsequent crops, so the surplus may not be as\ncomfortable as it appears.\nBaseline Scenario Variant 1: Chronic Harvest Blight\nHere, a chronic stress in the form of a severe harvest blight\nwas introduced. The modeled blight has a probability of oc-\ncurrence of 50 percent per year, and when it does occur, it\naffects roughly 50 percent of the ripening grain fields. The\nblight is not spatially random but, rather, occurs in circular\npatches with radii of 1.0 kilometers; affected areas are not\nspatially correlated from year to year. Affected fields lose\nfrom 80 to 90 percent of their grain yield, in the month or\nFIGURE 10. 100-Year baseline run: Trends in settlement food pro-\nduction and consumption.\nTABLE 1.

Thus, the total spatially and temporally\naveraged effect of the blight is to reduce grain yields by\nroughly (0.5) \u00d7 (0.5) \u00d7 (0.8)\u2014about 20 percent. The prob-\nlem for the settlement community is that the blight impacts\nare not felt uniformly; rather, they are visited heavily on a\nsubset of settlement households.\nIn the 50-year blight scenario run, the simulated set-\ntlement was significantly affected by the blight. Table 1\ncompares the frequency with which households resorted to\nexchange-related coping mechanisms in the 50-year blight\ncase compared to the first 50 years of the baseline case. To\ncope with the chaotically varying crop yields they experi-\nenced in the blight case, households resorted to a markedly\nhigher volume of grain loans (up 90 percent) and exchanges\nof livestock for grain (up 45 percent), though grain gifts\nfrom kin maintained a consistent level in both runs.\nUltimately, some households could not sustain them-\nselves by applying the coping mechanisms available and\nwere forced to emigrate. At 50 years into the simulation,\nthe settlement population in the blight case was 452, down\nfrom the initial population of 501 and far below the baseline\nrun\u2019s population of 628 at the 50-year mark.\nBaseline Scenario Variant 2: Chronic Shortage\nof Plow Teams\nThis variant tested the resiliency of the simulated settlement\nto variations in a single key component in the agricultural\nprocess: households\u2019 access to plow teams. Ten-year simu-\nlations were run for three variants that differed from the\nbase case only in the settlement\u2019s overall number of plow\nteams per household. The base case value was 0.5 (half as\nmany plow teams as households). We also examined cases\nin which the ratio was 0.25, 0.1875, and 0.125.\nFigures 11 and 12 illustrate a behavior frequently seen\nin complex systems: an abrupt and vivid change in aggre-\ngated system behavior as a hidden resource threshold is\nreached. The population traces in Figure 11 indicate that the\n0.25 and 0.1875 plow team per household ratio cases appear\nto be sustainable, differing little from the base case. This im-\nplies that plow-team availability is not a serious constraint\nto successful agriculture at those resource levels. However,\nthe simulated community in the 0.125 case (one plow team\nfor every eight households) fails catastrophically (see Figure\n11), resulting in a precipitous decline in settlement popula-\ntion. The main reason for this exodus can be seen in Figure\n12, which depicts total area of land that was required for\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 65\nFIGURE 11. Effects of varying household access to plow teams on\nsettlement population sustainability.\ncropping but could not be plowed and therefore brought to\nharvest because there were insufficient plow teams. When\nthe number of plow teams was generous (one team for less\nthan four households), nearly every household was able\nto plow all of its fields as allotted each year; in fact, with\nmore generous allocations plow teams could rest because\nthey were surplus to requirements. As the number of house-\nholds sharing each plow team increased, on average the area\nof land plowed per household fell below the area required\nto support a family. Equally, because increasing numbers\nof families were in a position of stress, the total area of\nland that could not be taken up for cultivation (because\nit could not be plowed) increased dramatically. The notion-\nally \u201cabandoned\u201d area of land then decreases (years three to\nten) simply because the number of households decreased as\npopulation declined as a result of inadequate food supplies.\nThis simulation highlights the critical role that plow\nteams play in the agricultural economy. It also shows that\nthe simplified averages employed in the archaeological and\ntext-based model (above) fail to incorporate the elasticity\nthat is apparent from the simulation. However, the simula-\ntion is too mechanistic in its assumptions (a problem of our\nsimplified notion of input data), because as the number of\nhouseholds sharing plow teams increased beyond the criti-\ncal threshold, in reality some of the households would turn\n(or return) to manual cultivation by hoe or related tech-\nnologies. This would not only enable more land to be re-\nturned to cultivation, but because hoe cultivation can be\nFIGURE 12. Effects of varying household access to plow teams on\ntillage-related crop failures.\nFIGURE 13. Settlement-cropping response to a five-year drought.\nassociated with slightly higher yields per unit area than\nplowing (Blanton 2004), this policy would offset the mas-\nsive loss of production caused by diminished plowing ca-\npacity. Clearly future simulations should incorporate more\nalternative forms of soil preparation.\nBaseline Scenario Variant 3: Severe\nFive-Year Drought\nThis scenario variant examines the simulated settlement\u2019s\nadaptive response to a severe environmental shock: in this\ncase, a prolonged drought. As is illustrated in Figure 13,\na dramatic reduction of rainfall to perilously low levels of\naround 100 millimeters per year was imposed on the com-\nmunity for simulation years eight though 12.\nThe climate shock in this scenario prompted several\ntypes of adaptive response by the agents. Figure 13 shows\nthat the number of hectares cultivated in the year after the\ndrought began increased substantially. This response was\ntriggered by agents attempting to crop as many fields as\npossible to compensate for poor yields per hectare. (That\nthis expedient proved at least partially successful can prob-\nably be attributed to the moisture-conserving fallowing\npracticed by all simulated households.) Conversely, the\nnumber of hectares cultivated decreased after normal rain-\nfall amounts resumed, as crop yields per hectare returned\nto normal and the need to cultivate many fields subsided.\nFurther, to combat the stress caused by the low rainfall and\nreduced yields, households made more use of their kin net-\nworks to share food resources. This is demonstrated in Fig-\nure 14, which shows a significant increase in gift exchanges\nduring the drought. Other transactions increased on a\nper-household basis during the drought years, although\nthe number of transactions for the other stress-coping op-\ntions was less than that of kin members sharing their food\nresources with each other. Also, the number of transactions\ndecreased after the first year of the drought, which perhaps\ncan be explained by reference to the previous figure: House-\nholds seem to have adjusted to a new quasiequilibrium\nduring the drought by consistently planting more field\narea in grain until the drought relaxed its grip.\nThe settlement appears to have absorbed the environ-\nmental shock of the five-year drought rather well, despite\ngrain yields that dropped by 46 percent on average during\n66 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 14. Volume of household grain gifts, livestock sales, and\ngrain loans for a five-year drought scenario.\nthe drought period (from 697 kg\/ha down to 376 kg\/ha).\nAlthough the total population did level off for the duration\nof the drought, it resumed its growth at roughly the pre-\ndrought rate once the drought was over. The demographic\nshift was caused by temporarily increased emigration rates,\nrather than declining birth rates. The rate of increase in\nnumber of households appeared to be essentially unaffected\nby the drought.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nHere the more conventional approach of modeling land-\nscapes around the settlement provides a useful estimate of\nthe zones of cultivation, beyond which lay presumably the\npastoral lands. Clearly the populations derived by simula-\ntion (639) are well below the estimates derived from site size\nand catchment radius (ca. 1,700), and until we have a more\ncomplete settlement system with neighboring communities\nand a pool of mobile population in place, it is to be expected\nthat population levels will continue to be modest. Rather, at\nthis stage, these interim results may better be regarded as a\nbarometer of community health than generators of popula-\ntion estimates, and it is necessary to increase simulation run\ntime and deal with the problem of the loss of \u201cfailed house-\nholds\u201d from the system before it can be considered realistic.\nNevertheless, the use of agent-based modeling to\ntackle problems of human\u2013environment interactions\nconsiderably increases the richness of any analysis. By in-\ncorporating a wide range of household size and capabili-\nties, agent-based simulations provide a more dynamic range\nof outcomes than the traditional approach discussed. The\nsimulation shows that some families gain more resources\n(such as animals) at the expense of others who may be-\ncome impoverished. Ultimately, such differentiation will\nprobably result in a form of social evolution in which elite\ngroups develop and prosper at the expense of other groups\nthat become marginalized and impoverished, and which ei-\nther leave the settlement or may become clients of the more\nprosperous groups.\nThe tendency for livestock sales to peak during crises\n(Variant 3) is reminiscent of the famine and droughts in\nWest Africa of the 1970s, during which peasant farmers\nsold their cattle to buy increasingly scarce and expensive\ngrain (Mortimore 1989). Such droughts resulted in a sharp\ndrop in the \u201cprice\u201d of cattle and a massive increase in\nthe value or price of grain. Although the role of markets\nin the third millennium economy continues to be debated,\nthe operation of factors such as those that prevailed during\nthe West African drought would result in some members\nof the community (those with more resources and am-\nple food in store) becoming enriched with animals at the\nexpense of the progressively more-impoverished peasants.\nUltimately, this might result in members of such enriched\nfamilies taking to the steppe to become part- or even\nfull-time nomadic pastoralists, while perhaps retaining a\nfoothold in the parent community. Such processes could\nresult in significant declines in urban population and in-\ncreases in nomadic pastoral groups.\nOne outcome of the modeling is that as a result of the\nemployment of adaptive strategies such as exchange of sur-\nplus products, extensification of land use, and so on, it ap-\npears that population and household numbers do not nec-\nessarily decline during periods of acute drought as much\nas might be expected (Variant 3). This underscores a more\ngeneral outcome: namely, that high-amplitude inputs (e.g.,\nrainfall) may be absorbed by social factors to result in low-\namplitude outputs (i.e., population). In the case of drought\navoidance by extensification, this is only possible if it is\npossible to cultivate more land. However, large urban set-\ntlements (such as 100 ha Hamoukar) would be maximizing\ncrop production to feed its 10,000-plus population, thereby\nlimiting the options for increasing cropped area (Gibson\net al. 2002; Ur 2002). In addition, if the plow animals them-\nselves suffered high mortality rates because of the drought,\nthis too would limit the options available. Nevertheless,\nthere were options and these would frequently be exercised,\nif circumstances permitted. More generally, these results il-\nlustrate that if sufficient land is available, the most serious\nimpacts of droughts might be avoided to some degree; if\nnot, then crop failures would be more likely. Therefore, the\nsituation of a run of dry years during a phase of maximum\nurbanization and land-use intensification might therefore\nbe much more significant than a run of dry years where\nland was freely available. In other words, the increasing ur-\nbanization that occurred during the later third millennium\nB.C.E. in the face of a drying climate might have resulted\nin severe crop failures, famine, and societal collapse. How-\never, this would have varied spatially depending on local\nclimate, population density, trade, and wealth.\nThe modeling approach employed successfully demon-\nstrates that complex societies were indeed capable of a wide\nrange of responses to various classes of acute input varia-\ntion. Clearly the above results represent only a beginning,\nand it is crucial not to be too na\u0131\u00a8ve when interpreting the\nresults. The mere incorporation of a factor in the model\n(such as exchange of animals during stress) necessarily re-\nsults in such mechanisms contributing to the output. It is\ntherefore essential to guard against circularity of argument.\nNevertheless, we feel that by setting such mechanisms\nwithin a quantifiable framework, which can be tested using\nWilkinson et al. \u2022 Urbanization within a Dynamic Environment 67\nnumerous repeat scenarios, it should be possible to produce\nmore reliable analyses than has traditionally been the case.\nT.
