Exploiting the full potential of gene\nsequences becoming available for V. destructor requires adaptation of modern molecular biology approaches to\nthis non-model organism. Using a mu-class glutathione S-transferase (VdGST-mu1) as a candidate gene we\ninvestigated the feasibility of gene knockdown in V. destructor by double-stranded RNA-interference (dsRNAi).\nResults: Intra-haemocoelic injection of dsRNA-VdGST-mu1 resulted in 97% reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels\n48 h post-injection compared to mites injected with a bolus of irrelevant dsRNA (LacZ). This gene suppression was\nmaintained to, at least, 72 h. Total GST catalytic activity was reduced by 54% in VdGST-mu1 gene knockdown mites\ndemonstrating the knockdown was effective at the translation step as well as the transcription steps. Although\nnear total gene knockdown was achieved by intra-haemocoelic injection, only half of such treated mites survived\nthis traumatic method of dsRNA administration and less invasive methods were assessed. V. destructor immersed\novernight in 0.9% NaCl solution containing dsRNA exhibited excellent reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels\n(87% compared to mites immersed in dsRNA-LacZ). Importantly, mites undergoing the immersion approach had\ngreatly improved survival (75-80%) over 72 h, approaching that of mites not undergoing any treatment.\nConclusions: Our findings on V. destructor are the first report of gene knockdown in any mite species and\ndemonstrate that the small size of such organisms is not a major impediment to applying gene knockdown\napproaches to the study of such parasitic pests. The immersion in dsRNA solution method provides an easy,\ninexpensive, relatively high throughput method of gene silencing suitable for studies in V. destructor, other small\nmites and immature stages of ticks.\nBackground\nThe European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is vital to the\npollination of agricultural and wild plants [1]. There is\nwidespread concern about the worldwide decline in the\nabundance of A. mellifera [2]. The ectoparasitic Varroa\nmite (Varroa destructor) is the most important pest of\nA. mellifera and plays a central role to honey bee losses\n[3]. V. destructor originally parasitized the Asian bee\n(A. cerana) where it nearly exclusively parasitized the\nmale bees (drones), thus making little impact on the bee\ncolony. However, in the 1950\u2019s V. destructor shifted to\nthe European honey bee (A. mellifera) upon which it\nparasitizes both the drones and female bees (workers).\nThis shift in parasitized caste is significant because the\nworkers make up the bulk of the adult bee population\nwithin a colony [4]. V. destructor entered mainland Eur-\nope in the 1970\u2019s, the USA in 1987 and the UK in 1992\nand subsequently has been associated with the loss of\nmillions of colonies [3]. The mite causes damage by\nfeeding on the haemolymph of both the developing bee\nwithin brood cells and the adult bee. Mites also transmit\na variety of pathogens, most notably deformed wing\nvirus. In terms of both the number of enterprises\naffected and the impact of global food production, var-\nroasis is arguably the most serious disease of livestock\nin any species.

The\nRNAi mechanism involves the in vivo production of\nsmall interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) from larger\nintroduced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). siRNA\nmolecules target and destroy specific mRNA, silencing\nthe target gene at the post-transcriptional stage. RNAi\nhas been used successfully to investigate genes in a\nrange of invertebrate species to date including gut pro-\nteins in tsetse flies [6]; moulting genes in Tribolium cas-\ntaneum [7], aquaporins in aphids [8], a putative\nprostaglandin E synthase in sealice [9] and extensively in\nticks (reviewed in [10]). In most cases, administration of\ndsRNA to the invertebrate target is achieved by intra-\nhaemocoelic injection, though immersion in solutions\ncontaining the dsRNA has been employed for nema-\ntodes and sea lice.\nIn this study, we assessed the feasibility of gene\nknockdown in V. destructor using dsRNA and deter-\nmined the speed and persistence of the gene knockdown\neffect. Additionally, we examined less invasive methods\nof dsRNA administration to increase ease of experimen-\ntation and improve mite survivability. The chosen target\ngene was a glutathione S-transferase of the mu class.\nGSTs were selected for study as they have been impli-\ncated in acaricide resistance in ticks [11,12] and scabies\nmites [13,14] and were readily amenable to activity\nassays to assess the effect of gene knockdown at the\ntranslational step.\nResults\nBioinformatics and phylogeny\nOf the three putative Varroa GSTs, two belonged to the\nmu class and the other to the kappa GST class. The lar-\ngest PCR product sequenced (563 bp) was termed\nVdGST-mu1 and the sequence deposited to EMBL\n[Accession No.: FR668088]. VdGST-mu1 was 100%\nidentical to the sequence (639 bp) from a pyrosequen-\ncing project on V. destructor from the USA (Dr. Jay\nEvans, pers. comm.). Alignment of the protein sequence\nof VdGST-mu1 (213 amino acids) with other muGSTs\nfrom a variety of acari indicated that although it consti-\ntuted 88% of the estimated open-reading frame, about\n27 amino acids from the N-terminus were missing\n(Figure 1). Motifs characteristic of muGSTs were pre-\nsent in VdGST-mu1 as well as conserved glutathione\nand substrate binding sites. Notably, the mu loop in\nVdGST-mu1 was considerably different compared to\nother acarine muGSTs.\nFollowing alignment of the mite, tick and insect\nsequences, but before phyogenetic trees were con-\nstructed, the sequences were truncated by approximately\n27 amino acids corresponding to those missing at the\nN-terminus in VdGST-mu1. Neighbour-joining, mini-\nmum evolution and maximum parsimony methods gave\ntrees with similar topology and approximate bootstrap\nvalues and so only the neighbour-joining tree is pre-\nsented. The acarine muGSTs clearly separated from the\nmost similar insect GSTs (Figure 2). Within the acarine\nmuGSTs, ticks and mites branched into different clades.\nSuprisingly, the VdGST-mu1 did not branch with the\nmite clade, but rather were located in a clade containing\ntick muGSTs. Concordantly, VdGST-mu1 shared a\nhigher amino acid homology with ticks (e.g. Rhipicepha-\nlus appendiculatus, [GenBank: AY298732.1], 58% iden-\ntity; Ixodes scapularis, [GenBank: XM_0024017051.1],\n45% identity) than with mite muGSTs (e.g. Sarcoptes\nscabei hominis, [GenBank: AF462190.1], 38% identity;\nDermatphagoides pteronyssimus, [GenBank: AY825938],\n35% identity).\nTissue distribution of three V. destructor GSTs\nRT-PCR analysis of the three cloned GSTs demon-\nstrated marked differences in both their abundances and\ntissue distributions (Figure 3). VdGST-mu1 seemed to\nbe an abundantly expressed gene that was expressed at\na similar level in all three dissected tissues examined,\nnamely synganglia, Malpighian tubules and the gut. In\ncontrast, VdGST-mu2 is a less abundantly expressed\ngene that was clearly expressed in the synganglion and\nMalpighian tubules, but expressed at a much lower level\nin gut tissue. VdGST-kap was by far the least abun-\ndantly expressed of the GSTs studied, with a slightly\nhigher level in the Malpighian tubules than the syngan-\nglion or gut.\nEffectiveness and persistence of VdGST-mu1 knockdown\nin V. destructor\ndsRNA was administered to V. destructor by intrahae-\nmocoelic injection with a 20 nl bolus in distilled water\nand the mites then allowed to feed on bee larvae. The\ntranscript level of VdGST-mu1 was monitored by RT-\nPCR at various time points over the following 3 days\n(Figure 4). No effect was observed at 18 or 24 hr after\nthe dsRNA injection, but by 48 hr dsVdGST-mu1\ninjected mites had a 30-fold decrease of VdGST-mu1\nmRNA compared to dsLacZ injected mites (P < 0.001,\nFigure 4B), that represented an almost total knockdown\nof the target transcript and which was uniform across\nthe three individual mites tested. By 72 h, the effect of\nCampbell et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:73\nhttp:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/3\/1\/73\nPage 2 of 10\nthe RNAi treatment at the transcript level was still\npresent (P < 0.001).\nEffectiveness and mortality rates of different routes of\ndsRNA administration\nThough microinjection of dsRNA had very effectively\nknocked down VdGST-mu1 mRNA levels (96 \u00b1 3.7%, n\n= 4, Figure 4B), such injection techniques were labor-\nious, required specialised equipment and led to high\nmortality rates in the mites (50% survival, n = 62).\nAlternative, less invasive approaches to dsRNA adminis-\ntration were assessed (Table 1). A 1 \u03bcl droplet of 0.2%\nTriton-X100 (v\/v) placed on mites immobilised on adhe-\nsive tape rapidly killed the mites (n = 6), whereas a 1 \u03bcl\ndroplet of dsRNA in plain water had no mortality (100%\nsurvival, n = 14), but was totally ineffective in reducing\nVdGST-mu1 transcript levels. Mites completely sub-\nmerged in 0.2% Triton-X100 died very quickly (n = 15),\nwhereas mites submerged in water died within a few\nhours (n = 15). Increasing the osmolality of the soaking\nsolution by using 0.9% saline greatly increased survival\nof mites (72% survival, n = 26) submerged for 14 h at\n4\u00b0C and then placed on bee pupae for a further 48 hr.\nThis method effectively knocked down VdGST-mu1\nmRNA (87 \u00b1 0.7%, n = 3; Figure 5). It should be noted\nthat mites removed from brood cells and placed on bee\npupae in Petri dishes but receiving no treatment at all,\ntypically exhibited survival from 75 - 90% over a 48 hr\nperiod.\nPhenotype of VdGST-mu1 knockdown mites\nTo determine that the knockdown effect of treatment with\neither dsRNA-lacZ or dsRNA-VdGST-mu1 was not sim-\nply just at the mRNA (transcriptional) level, but was also\ncarried through to the protein (translational) level, we\nassessed total GST catalytic activity in mites (Figure 6).\nGHHH G H G G\nSarcoptes     MSSKPTLGYWDLRGLGQSIRILLTYAGVDFVDKRYKIGSAPDFDRGEWLNDKF--NLGLD 58 \nPsoroptes     MDTKPVLGYWDARGLGQAIRLLLTYADVDFIDKRYKVGPAPNYDRSEWLNDKY--NLGLD 58 \nBoophilus     --MAPVLGYWDIRGLAQPIRLLLAHVDAKVDDKRYTCGPPPDFDRSSWLNEKT--KLGLE 56 \nRhipicephalus --MAPILGYWNIRGLAQPFRLLLAHVDAKVEEKQYSCGPPPDFDKSYWLSEKP--KLGLD 56 \nVarroa        -----------------------------FEERRYTTIAASDFDKSEWALEKANNKLNLA 31 \n      . :::*.  ...::*:. *  :*   :*.* \nGGG GG GG H\nSarcoptes     FPNLPYYIEGDVKLTQSIAILRYLGRKHKLDGQNEQEWRRITLCEQQIMDLLMALARICY 118 \nPsoroptes     FPNCPYYLDGNVRLTQSIAILRYIARKYNLNGNNEMEKIRISLAEQQIVDLNQALSRVAY 118 \nBoophilus     FPNLPYYIDGDVKLTQSMAILRYLARKHGLEGKTEAEKQRVDVSEQQFADFRMNWVRLCY 116 \nRhipicephalus FPNLPYYIDGDVKLTQSMAILRYLARKYDLMGKTEAEKQRVDVVEQQLADFRVNWGRLCY 116 \nVarroa        FPNLPYLVDGSVKLSQSHAIMRYLGRKFNLIGTTEIELAHCELVEQQIADLRTAFMKLCY  91 \n              *** ** ::*.*:*:** **:**:.**. * * .* *  :  : ***: *:     ::.* \nSarcoptes     DPNFEKLKL--------------DLVAKLPDDLKLFSKFLGDHQFVAGTNISYIDFLVYE 164 \nPsoroptes     NPNCEKLKP--------------EYLEKLPEQLELLSKFLNNQPFISGTNISYADFLLYE 164 \nBoophilus     NPDFEKLKG--------------DYLKNLPASLKAFSDYLGTHKFFAGDNLTYVDFIAYE 162 \nRhipicephalus SPDFEKLKG--------------DYLKDLPASLKAFSDYLGNRKFFAGDNLTYVDFIAYE 162 \nVarroa        SPSFERLQEGTCSKADCLGVLNGGFIDRFAHMLQEISAFLGERKWFLNEKLTYVDFLAYE 151 \n              .*. *:*:                 :  :.  *: :* :*. : :. . :::* **: ** \nSarcoptes     YLIRVKIFAPEIFTKFPNLNSYITRIESMPKISAYIKQQ--EPQLFNGPMAKWNTK------ 218 \nPsoroptes     YLTKIKVLMPELFVKNDNLKKFHERIEALPRINEYIKKQ--QPKSFHGPTALWNGQYA\u2013--- 220 \nBoophilus     MLAQHLIFAPDCLKDFANLKAFVDRIEALPHVAAYLKSDKCIKWPLNGDMASFGSRLQKKP- 223 \nRhipicephalus MLDQHLLFAPDCLKDFANLKAFVDRVAALPRVAAYLKSDKCIKWPLNGDMASFGSRLQKKP- 223 \nVarroa        LLFQMYVWNSSVFKNVTNLTDFITRFEALPQISAYMKTDSYIKWPFNNIMASYGSRNQVCPF 213 \n              * :  :  .. : .  **. :  *. ::*::  *:* :      ::.  * :. :    \nmu loop \nFigure 1 Amino acid alignment of VdGST-mu1 with other acarine muGSTs. muGSTs from two mites, Sarcoptes scabiei type hominis\n[GenBank: AY825933] and Psoroptes ovis [GenBank: AM991140], and from two ticks Boophilus microplus [GenBank: AF077609] and Rhipicephalus\nappendiculatus [GenBank: AY298732] were aligned with VdGST-mu1.

As\nsuch, GSTs play an important role in phase II detoxifi-\ncation of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds\nsuch as pesticides. Specifically, GSTs have been shown\nto be involved in acaricide resistance in ticks [11,12],\nscabies mites [13,14] and plant mites [16]. In the present\nstudy we demonstrated the presence and tissue expres-\nsion of two mu- and one kappa-class GST in V. destruc-\ntor. The largest sequence fragment termed, VdGST-mu1\nwas 100% identical to the sequence present in an\nongoing pyrosequencing project (Dr. Jay Evans, personal\ncomm.) performed on V. destructor samples from the\nUSA. VdGST-mu1 was present in all mite tissues\nassessed and was, by far, the most abundant of the three\nGSTs examined. VdGST-mu1 contained conserved glu-\ntathione and substrate binding residues and motifs char-\nacteristic of mu-class GSTs. However, both the mu-loop\nand SNAIL\/TRAIL motifs were notably different from\nthose of other acarine muGSTs. Interestingly, VdGST-\nmu1 was more similar to tick muGSTs than that of\nmites.\nVdGST-mu1 was used as a test gene to assess the fea-\nsibility of dsRNAi gene knockdown in V. destructor.\nEssentially total suppression of VdGST-mu1 expression\nwas achieved within 48 h after an intrahaemocoelic\n Sarcoptes scabiei delta-GST\n Tribolium castaneum\n Pediculus humanus corporis\n Apis mellifera\n Drosophila melanogaster\n Dermacentor variabilis\n Boophilus microplus\n Ixodes scapularis\n Rhipicephalus appendiculatus\n Varroa destructor\n Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-1\n major allergen p Dp 15\n Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-2\n Suidasia medanensis Sui m 8 allergen\n Psoroptes ovis\n100\n57\n44\n100\n92\n51\n34\n41\n80\n98\n100\n100\n74\nm\nite\ns\ninsects\nticks\n Lepidoglyphus destructor allergen\n Sarcoptes scabiei type hominis\n Sarcoptes scabiei type canis100\n90\nFigure 2 Phylogeny of the acarine muGST family.

We\ntried the addition of the detergent Triton X-100 to\nbreak the surface tension of the water allowing the\ndsRNA solution to become more in contact with the\ncuticle rather than held off it by the fine hair layer\n(Figure 7). However, Triton X-100 caused rapid death of\nthe mites. Next we assessed total immersion of mites as\na possible route for dsRNA administration as was pre-\nviously successfully performed with salmon lice in sea-\nwater [9]. Mites immersed in 0.2% Triton X-100 died\nrapidly and, surprisingly, mites in distilled water died\nwithin a few hours. We postulated that the hypo-osmo-\nlarity of the distilled water caused an osmotic influx of\nwater into the mite tissues and this was exacerbated in\nthe presence of Triton X-100 which may have allowed\nwater to enter through the spiracles more rapidly with\nthe reduced water tension.\nIncreasing the osmotic concentration of the immer-\nsion solution by using 0.9% NaCl allowed the mites to\nremain under solution overnight at 4\u00b0C with 75-80%\nActin\nGST Mu\ndsRNA-LacZ dsRNA-GST Mu\nFigure 5 Effectiveness of gene-knockdown of VdGST-mu1 in\nV. destructor following immersion in dsRNA solution.

It is not\nknown what is the site of dsRNA entry into the mite,\nbut this is of considerable interest and importance. We\npresumed entry to be either by ingestion or though the\ntracheal system via the spiracles. Adult female\nV. destructor enter the prepupal cells 24 - 48 h before\nthe cell is capped and they remain hidden from vigilant\nnurse bees by submerging themselves in the liquid\nbrood food [18] with the peritremes surrounding the\nspiracles protruding from the liquid enabling the mites\nto breathe [19,20]. It may be possible to improve survi-\nvability and, possibly increase gene knockdown efficacy,\nif the osmolality of the immersion solution were\nincreased to that of liquid brood food that is presumed\nto be greater than that of physiological saline (0.9%\nNaCl). Indeed, further optimisation of this approach\ncould be attempted, if thought necessary, by altering\nimmersion temperature and time, but the method pre-\nsented here is a good starting point.\nNot only was gene knockdown achieved at the tran-\nscriptional step (mRNA) but this was also apparent at\nthe translational step (protein) with decreased GST cata-\nlytic activity. The apparent discrepancy between a 97%\nreduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript level and the 54%\nreduction in GST enzyme activity is because the enzyme\nassay detects total GST activity not just that contributed\nby VdGST-mu1. There have been reports of so-called\n\u201coff-target\u201d effects of RNAi whereby unintended genes\nsharing stretches of identical homology can be affected.\nA meta-analysis of dsRNAi studies in Drosophila high-\nthroughput screens indicated that dsRNAs containing\n\u2265 19 nucleotide perfect matches to unintended targets\ncan, in some instances, result in off-target effects [21].\nIn the case of VdGST-mu1, the most similar gene we\nknow of in Varroa is VdGST-mu2 [EMBL Accession\nNo.: FR675857] which shares 29% identity at the nucleo-\ntide level, but the greatest matching stretch possible is\none of 12\/19 nucleotides (Figure 8). Thus, it is likely\nthat the reduction in assayable total GST activity is due\nto a specific knockdown of VdGST-mu1, but further\nstudies would be necessary to confirm this. Our data\nwould indicate that VdGST-mu1 is the predominant\ncatalytic GST in V. destructor and highlights the specifi-\ncity advantage of gene knockdown over chemical\nenzyme inhibitors which simultaneously affect multiple\ngene products.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we have established dsRNA knockdown\nin the critically important bee parasite, V. destructor,\nusing a mu-class GST as the candidate gene. A simple,\ninexpensive, high throughput method of dsRNA admin-\nistration was established with low mortality rates for\nV. destructor. This immersion approach may be applied\nto other small acarine pests such as scabies mites, sheep\nscab mites, poultry mites and plant pest mites. Addi-\ntionally, the approach can be employed in ticks where\nthe immersion approach is more convenient than injec-\ntions for adult ticks but can also be applied to the smal-\nler larval and nymphal stages which are presently not\nincluded in such gene knockdown studies. The degree\nof knockdown was essentially complete and persisted for\nseveral days and was apparent at both the transcript and\nprotein level. The dsRNAi approach will allow research-\ners to make full use of the V. destructor gene sequences\nbecoming available to investigate biological questions in\nthis important parasite, notably to develop control stra-\ntegies in the era when current suitable acaricides are no\nlonger effective due to widespread resistance. Peculiarly\nto Varroa, because of the relatively close relatedness\nbetween the parasite and host (Varroa and bee) it is\nespecially difficult to develop pesticides effective against\nthe Varroa, but innocuous to the bee. In this respect,\nthe specificity of dsRNAi may allow targeting of\nV. destructor genes as a control strategy, as suggested\nfor other insect pests [22].\nMethods\nMite collection and husbandry\nVarroa destructor mites were collected from capped\nbrood cells of Apis mellifera from hives in York, Eng-\nland that had purposefully been untreated for Varroa\ncontrol. Prior to harvesting mites, the bee frames were\nmaintained in Aberdeen at 27\u00baC and 40% relative\nhumidity with a 15.5 h : 8.5 h, light:dark regime. Mites\nwere either removed from newly emerged adult bees or\nfrom pupae following uncapping of the brood cell and\nextraction of the pupae. Mites were collected, bisected\nand placed in RNA ZR extraction buffer (Zymo\nResearch, Orange, California, USA) and stored at -80 \u00baC\nprior to initial total RNA isolation.\nRT-PCR of GSTs from V. destructor\nSix adult (pharate and mobile) and 2 deutonymph mites\nwere homogenized in 600 \u03bcl extraction buffer and total\nRNA prepared using a mini RNA Isolation II Kit (Zymo\nResearch), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Eluted\nRNA was co-precipitated with glycogen in 95% ethanol\nand resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of DEPC-treated water. After\nisolation, 2 \u03bcg total RNA was DNase treated with 2 \u03bcl\n(2U) RQ1-DNase (Promega, Southampton, UK) and 2 \u03bcl\nRQ1 buffer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. DNase-\ntreated total RNA (2 \u03bcg) was incubated at 70\u00b0C with 0.5\n\u03bcg of oligo d(T)15 (Promega) in a total volume of 10 \u03bcl\nfor 5 min. Material was snap-chilled on ice for 5 min\nprior to the addition of 5 \u03bcl 5\u00d7RT buffer, 1 \u03bcl dNTPs\n(25 mM each), 0.5 \u03bcl Bioscript-reverse transcriptase and\nDEPC water to 25 \u03bcl.

Of 14 putative V. destructor GST partial\nsequences identified, we chose three to evaluate further:\ntwo mu-class GSTs (VdGST-mu1 and VdGST-mu2) and\none kappa class (VdGST-kap). These Varroa transcripts\nwere isolated by RT-PCR using primers based on these\nsequences. PCR reactions consisted of 1 \u03bcl cDNA tem-\nplate, 5 \u03bcl 10 \u00d7 reaction buffer, 2 \u03bcl 50 mM MgCl2, 1 \u03bcl\ndNTPs (25 mM each), 1 \u03bcl each primer (10 mM each),\n0.5 \u03bcl (1.25 U) Taq (Bioline, London,UK) and DEPC-\ntreated water to give a 50 \u03bcl total volume. Primer pairs\nused were VdGST-mu-F1 (CAAGTTAAATCTTGC\nGTTTCC) and VdGST-mu1-R1 (CTGTCCGTCTT\nCATGTATGC), VdGST-mu2-F1 (ACGATTTATCCGT\nTTTGACG) and VdGST-mu2-R2 (CCAACTGATGT\nGTCGTTCC), VdGST-Kap-F1 (TACTGGTGGT\nCGTTTCAGG) and VdGST-Kap-R1 (CTTCATAGGC-\nCAAGAGATGC), generating products of 494, 396 and\n343 bp, respectively. PCR cycling conditions were as fol-\nlows: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of\n1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 53\u00b0C and 45 s at 72\u00b0C followed\nby a final extension time of 15 min at 72\u00b0C. Products\nwere visualised on an agarose gel and specific bands\nexcised and cloned into pCR4-TOPO TA vector (Invi-\ntrogen). Purified plasmids were submitted for sequen-\ncing to Eurofins MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) from\nflanking T7 and T3 promoter regions to confirm the\noriginal sequence data.\nBioinformatics\nThe GST class of the different Varroa sequences was\ndetermined by database searches and phylogenetic ana-\nlysis. For VdGST-mu1, protein sequences from various\nacari were extracted from both non-redundant and EST\ndatabases at GenBank by tBLASTx. Additionally, the\nmost similar GST sequences in four model insect spe-\ncies for which complete genomes are available were also\nobtained. Protein sequences were aligned in CLUS-\nTALW2 [23]. These sequences were used to estimate\nphylogeny with neighbour-joining, minimum evolution\nand maximum parsimony methods using MEGA version\n4.1 [24]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with\n10,000 bootstrap replicates.\nExpression of GST transcripts in tissues of V. destructor\nV. destructor mites, were removed from brood cells, as\ndescribed above, and dissected under ice-cold dissection\nbuffer (20 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).\nMalpighian tubules, gut and synganglia and were dis-\nsected from 20, 25 and 98 mites respectively, washed in\nfresh ice-cold dissection buffer and stored in 50 \u03bcl\nRNAlater (Sigma, Poole, UK) at -80 \u00b0C. Prior to RNA\nextraction, an additional 450 \u03bcl dissection buffer was\nadded to sample tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 g for\n15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was removed and tissue\nwashed with fresh dissection buffer before a final spin at\n10,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was discarded\nand 600 \u03bcl RNA ZR extraction buffer added to each tis-\nsue sample. Total RNA extraction, DNase treatment and\nreverse transcription were as described above. VdGST-\nmu1, VdGST-mu2 and VdGST-kap transcripts in tissue-\nspecific cDNA were assayed by PCR. PCR protocol and\ncycling conditions were carried out using the VdGST-\nmu1, VdGST-mu2 and VdGST-kap primers, as\ndescribed above over 30 cycles. Gel loading was normal-\nized to V. destructor actin (VdActinF, CATCAC-\nCATTGGTAACGAG and VdActinR, CGATCCAG\nACGGAATACTT) generating a fragment of approxi-\nmately 195 bp.\nPreparation of dsRNA\nVdGST-mu1-dsRNA was prepared using a BLOCK-iT\nRNAi TOPO transcription kit (Invitrogen), according to\nFigure 8 Alignment of VdGST-mu1 and VdGST-mu2 indicating stretches of perfect identity. Nucleotide sequences of VdGST-mu1 [EMBL:\nFR668088] and VdGST-mu2 [EMBL: FR675857] were aligned using ClustalW2 and edited in JalView Vers 2.5.1 [28] with gaps not permitted and\nconsensus stretches shown.\nCampbell et al.

Briefly, PCR was\ncarried out as described above using adult female\nV. destructor cDNA in conjunction with VdGST-mu1\nspecific primers (VdGST-mu1 F1\/R1), or with control\nLacZ-plasmid and LacZ specific primers (LacZ-F2,\nACCAGAAGCGGTGCCGGAAA and LacZ-R2, CCA-\nCAGCGGTGGTTCGGAT). Products were resolved on\nan agarose gel, excised and purified using a Qiagen gel\nextraction kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). TOPO-T7 linker\nwas ligated to VdGST-mu1 and LacZ reactions before a\nsecondary PCR was carried out to gain sense and anti-\nsense templates. T7-RNA polymerase was used in tran-\nscription reactions with target templates to generate\nsense and antisense RNA. Finally, RNA strands were\nannealed and the resultant dsRNA purified and quanti-\nfied in a micro-spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technol-\nogy Ltd). dsRNA was ethanol precipitated and\nresuspended in DEPC-treated water to a working con-\ncentration of 2.5 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl and stored at -80\u00b0C.\nProtocol of dsRNA injection and soaking\nAdult female V. destructor were removed from capped\nbrood cells along with associated bee larvae. Microinjec-\ntions were carried out using pulled glass capillary nee-\ndles in conjunction with a Harvard micro-injector\nsystem. Mites were placed on double-sided tape ventral\nside up, and injected with 20 nl (2.5 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl) of either\nVdGST-mu1-dsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA in either the soft\ntissue proximal to the anal region and postcoxal plate,\nor in the coxa IV region, as indicated in Figure 7. Nee-\ndles were left in each mite for 1 - 2 min to reduce the\nexpulsion of fluid from the wound and withdrawn\nslowly. Mites were left for 1 - 2 min to allow the injec-\ntion site to \u201cseal\u201d then returned to Petri dishes contain-\ning 1 bee larvae per 4 mites. Dead or unhealthy looking\nmites were removed after 1 hour and mortality was\nmonitored over 72 h in LacZ-dsRNA, VdGSTmu1-\ndsRNA and non-injected mites.\nTo assess non-invasive techniques for dsRNA delivery,\nmites were either completely immersed in dsRNA or\nwere exposed to a droplet of dsRNA on their ventral\ncarapace. For soaking experiments, adult mites were\nremoved from capped brood cells and placed in 500 \u03bcl\nmicrofuge tubes containing 20 \u03bcl VdGST-mu1-dsRNA\nor LacZ-dsRNA (2.5 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl) supplemented with either\nnothing, 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100 or both. Mites\nwere soaked at 4\u00baC overnight before being removed,\ndried and placed in Petri dishes at 27\u00baC, 95% relative\nhumidity with bee larvae. Alternatively, a sample of\nmites was exposed to dsRNA by attaching them to dou-\nble-sided tape and placing a 1 \u03bcl drop of VdGST-mu1-\ndsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA (2.5 \u03bcl\/\u03bcg) supplemented with\neither nothing, 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100 or both on\nthe ventral carapace. Mortality was monitored for 48 h\nprior to collection and validation of knockdown.\nValidation of RNAi\nTo validate RNAi in injected, soaked and droplet-\nexposed adults, the total RNA was extracted from indi-\nvidual mites 48 h post-treatment. In addition, persis-\ntence of the RNAi effect was measured in injected mites\nby harvesting at 18, 24, 48 and 72 h. Total RNA was\nextracted from mites using mini-RNA isolation kit II,\nprior to DNase-treatment and reverse transcription, as\ndescribed previously. PCR was carried out using either\nVdGST-mu1-dsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA treated sample\ncDNA in conjunction with primers specific for actin or\nVdGST-mu1 using primers and cycling conditions, as\ndescribed above. Products were visualized on an agarose\ngel normalized to actin loading. To assess persistence\nand approximate % knockdown, ImageJ software was\nused to carry out semi-quantitative densitometric analy-\nsis on gel images.\nGlutathione S-transferase activity in RNAi silenced mites\nAn enzymatic assay was used to assess the effect of\nsilencing VdGST-mu1 transcript on GST enzyme activ-\nity in dsRNA-treated mites. GST activity was measured\nby using monochlorobimane (MCB) as the substrate, as\npreviously described for scabies mites [25] and plant\nmites [26], but here we adapted it for cuvettes rather\nthan microplates. MCB forms a stable fluorescent conju-\ngate with reduced glutathione when catalyzed with GST.\nMites injected with LacZ-dsRNA or VdGST-mu1-\ndsRNA were harvested 48 h post-treatment and frozen\nat -80\u00baC. Mites were grouped into pairs and homoge-\nnized by milling 2 \u00d7 30 s, with a single 3 mm tungsten\nbead in 175 \u03bcl of ice cold 0.05 M Tris buffer pH7.5 in a\nmechanical tissue disruptor (TissueLyser, Qiagen). After\nmilling, samples were disrupted further in a sonicating\nwater bath for 3 \u00d7 20 s with chilling in between bursts\nthen centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00baC. The\nsupernatant was retained, subjected to three freeze\nthaw-cycles and sonicated for a further 2 \u00d7 20 s. Sam-\nples were then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00baC\nand 150 \u03bcl of supernatant from each sample used in the\nGST assay.
