INTRODUCTION\nTHE GaInNAs\u2013GaAs system has been extensively studiedin recent years due to its promising applications in\noptical fiber communication systems. It has large band offsets,\nparticularly in the electron confinement energy , in com-\nparison with the conventional InGaAsP\/InP, which is expected\nto suppress electron overflow [1]. GaInNAs is also suitable\nfor monolithic growth with GaAs\u2013AlAs distributed Bragg\nreflectors (DBRs) in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers\n(VCSELs) based on GaAs. As far as the formation mechanism\nof the narrow bandgap in Ga(In)NAs is concerned, the origin\nof the dramatic reduction of the bandgap with the participation\nof dilute nitrogen atoms in this material is still under debate.\nDifferent models have been suggested to explain the experi-\nmental data in this regard [2]\u2013[9]. For example, it is attributed\nto the band anticrossing between the Ga(In)As band edge and\nresonant N level [2], or results from the band-like impurity\nstates arising from isolated N-centers [3], [4], N-clusters [5], or\nN-induced bound states [6]. In fact, the distinct optical prop-\nerties of N atoms as isoelectronic centers in Ga(In)As, which\nform a resonant state a few hundred meV above the Ga(In)As\nconduction-band edge, have been observed experimentally\n[10]\u2013[12], consistent with theoretical predictions [13].

This contrasts with in-built\nstrain in quantum-well structures which primarily affects\nthe valence-band. Further, the application of high-pressure\nenables continuous tuning of the electronic band structure\nof semiconductors under test in a very convenient way.\nSince most important recombination mechanisms, such as\nthe band-to-band radiative recombination and nonradiative\nAuger recombination, exhibit a strong bandgap dependence,\nhigh-pressure is therefore powerful diagnostic tool to provide\ndeep insights into the optical and electrical properties of semi-\nconductors. It also allows testing of ideas about how properties\nsuch as the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates\nshould depend on the bandgap and configuration of electronic\nstates. This technique enables a better understanding of the\nbasic physical processes to be obtained and allows the design\nof optimum structures. For these reasons, the high-pressure as\nwell as temperature characteristics of GaInNAs devices have\nbeen extensively carried out in recent years [2], [11], [18],\n[19], and compared with InP-based systems such as InGaAsP\nand AlGaInAs with the same operating wavelength [20]\u2013[25].\nIt is found that the variation of the threshold current with\ntemperature and pressure in these lasers are strongly dependent\non the relative importance of the respective radiative and non-\nradiative recombination pathways. For example, it was shown\nthat Auger recombination plays an important role and causes a\nhigh sensitivity in the temperature characteristics of InGaAsP\ndevices [26]\u2013[29]. Also, the large Auger recombination current\nat threshold leads to a reduction of the threshold current with\nincreasing pressure [29], [30]. For GaInNAs, however, both\nthe Auger-like and defect-related nonradiative recombination\nplay important roles in the recombination mechanisms of\ncarriers at room temperature [31]. It is therefore important to\ndetermine the variation of the respective recombination current\ncomponents with pressure in order to better understand the\nrecombination processes constituting the threshold current in\nGaInNAs lasers at ambient pressure. In this paper, we present\na systematic experimental investigation on the pressure depen-\ndence of the threshold current in 1.3- m GaInNAs lasers.

The results are compared with theoretical\ncalculations and also with the measured results on InGaAsP\nand AlGaInAs lasers with the same operating wavelength.\nII. SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENT\nThe GaInNAs lasers were grown by solid source molecular\nbeam epitaxy (MBE) on -(001) GaAs substrates. An RF-cou-\npled plasma source was used to generate reactive nitrogen from\nN . A GaInNAs single quantum-well (SQW) of 6 nm thickness\nis symmetrically sandwiched between the two undoped GaAs\nwaveguiding layers and AlGaAs outer cladding layers. The In-\nand N-contents in the well are approximately 36% and 1.7%,\nrespectively. Broad-area lasers with a nominal stripe width of\n50 m and a cavity length of 700 m were used in this study.\nThe InGaAsP and AlGaInAs lasers, which used for compar-\nison with GaInNAs lasers, have a typical separate confinement\nheterostructure (SCH) multiple QW structure, grown by\nlow-pressure metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE)\non -InP substrates. The InGaAsP lasers consist of 8 com-\npressively strained InGaAsP QWs, separated by unstrained\nInGaAsP barriers ( m). The devices are buried\nheterostructures with a stripe width of 1.85 m and a nominal\ncavity length of 1500 m. The AlGaInAs lasers comprise\n8 compressively strained AlGaInAs wells with unstrained\nAlGaInAs barriers ( m). They have ridge waveguide\nmesa structures with a stripe width of 3.5 m and a nominal\ncavity length of 600 m. All of these lasers were designed to\noperate close to 1.3- m at room temperature (RT). The growth\nprocedures of GaInNAs, InGaAsP, and AlGaInAs lasers can be\nfound elsewhere [20], [26], [28].\nAll lasers investigated had as-cleaved facets and the mea-\nsurements were performed at RT and under pulsed operation\n(10 kHz, 0.5% duty cycle) in order to reduce current heating\neffects. The lasers were mounted in a piston-in-cylinder high-\npressure system capable of generating pressures up to 15 kbar.\nEssence-F was used for the pressure medium. An optical fiber\ngoing through the piston acts as a high-pressure window and is\nused to collect the light from the lasers inside the pressure cell\nand to transmit the signal directly into a high-resolution optical\nspectrum analyzer (HP 70 950A) and optical multimeter (Ando\nAQ2140).\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn Fig. 1, we show the measured variation of the lasing energy\nshift, , as a function of pressure in GaInNAs, InGaAsP,\nand AlGaInAs lasers at RT. The linear pressure coefficients of\nare found to be 9.2 , 8.4 , and\nmeV\/kbar for AlGaInAs, InGaAsP, and GaInNAs,\nrespectively. With increasing pressure, increases nearly\nlinearly in AlGaInAs and InGaAsP. By contrast, a sublinear\nincrease of is observed in GaInNAs. In order to under-\nstand this sublinear behavior, we plot in Fig. 2 the measured\npressure dependence of together with the theoretically ex-\npected variation of the minimum in GaInAs, and the nitrogen\nlevel. The GaInAs has the same In content as GaInNAs studied.\nIt is shown that, as pressure increases, the minimum increases\nmore rapidly while the N level increases slowly. As a result, the\nFig. 1.

For the GaInNAs devices, we have also compared\nthe pressure dependence of the threshold current in GaInNAs\nwith nearly the same In and N contents in the well but different\nstructures and quantum-well number [31], which show nearly\nthe same pressure behavior. It is shown that, in InGaAsP and\nAlGaInAs lasers [23], [26], the mixed contributions of the\nradiative and Auger recombination currents can explain the\npressure behavior of . Such analyzes suggest that the Auger\ncurrent % is severe in InGaAsP while the radiative\ncurrent (70%\u201380%) dominates in AlGaInAs. In GaInNAs,\nappears to follow up to about 6 kbar. However, above\n6 kbar, increases more strongly than . This pressure\nbehavior in GaInNAs lasers is likely to be strongly related to\nthe complicated variation of the band structure with pressure\nin this material.\nIn long wavelength semiconductor lasers, the total injection\ncurrent, , can be obtained by adding all the recombination cur-\nrent contributions\n(1)\nwhere is the monomolecular nonradiative current\ncorresponding to recombination via defects, is\ndue to the radiative recombination of electrons and holes, while\nis the nonradiative Auger-like recombination cur-\nrent. The carrier density effects on the coefficients of , and\nare neglected in this study [22]. Carrier leakage is generally\nexpected to be negligible due to the large conduction band offset\nin the GaInNAs devices [1]. The pressure dependence of the\ntotal threshold current, normalized at ambient pressure, using\n(1), can be rewritten as\n(2)\nwhere represents the relative contribu-\ntion of each recombination current to the total threshold current\nat ambient pressure (hence ), repre-\nsents the pressure factor of each recombination mechanism. For\nexample, the pressure factor of the band-to-band radiative re-\ncombination is given by [29]\n(3)\nThe pressure factor of the band-to-band Auger process in the\nnondegenerate approximation is given by [29], [32]\n(4)\nwhere is the Auger coefficient, is\nthe absolute temperature, and is the Boltzmann constant,\ndepends on the Auger process [29], [32] and is pressure depen-\ndent due to the pressure induced electron effective mass change,\nFig. 4. Spontaneous emission spectra collected from the window milled into\nthe substrate of the GaInNAs SQW laser under various pressures at the currents\nnear threshold at RT.\n, is the energy shift with increasing pres-\nsure. Since hydrostatic pressure increases , this leads to the\nreduction of with pressure. Furthermore, if the pressure-in-\nduced change of is negligible, the Auger current will de-\ncrease with increasing pressure as observed in InP-based de-\nvices [23], [26], [29], [30].\nIt is important to determine the relative contribution of each\nrecombination pathway involved in order to understand the pres-\nsure dependence of in a device. Because the integrated spon-\ntaneous emission intensity, , is proportional to the radia-\ntive recombination rate , we have\n(5)\nFrom (5), (1) can be rewritten as\n(6)\nwhere , and are unknown parameters. Based on\nthis simple model [29], [26], [28], [31], the monomolecular\nnonradiative current at threshold can be\ndetermined directly from a linear extrapolation of at low\ncurrent to laser threshold from a plot of versus .\nIn a similar way, the relative values of the radiative current\nand then the Auger-related current\nat threshold can be determined using (6).\nWe measured for the first time the high-pressure sponta-\nneous emission from a window milled into the substrate of\nthe GaInNAs SQW laser. Fig. 4 shows the strong blue shift\nof spontaneous emission spectra with increasing pressure at\nthreshold, which is consistent with the increase in bandgap\nwith pressure. From these measurements we determined the\nvariation of the important current paths present in the devices\nwith pressure, as shown in Fig. 5. At ambient pressure, upon\ninserting the GaInNAs devices into the pressure medium\n(Essence-F), we measured an increase in the threshold current\nof 690 mA compared with 460 mA in air. This is due to the\nreduction in facet reflectivity in the liquid and the consequent\nincrease in . This, therefore, gives rise to a relative in-\ncrease in the Auger current with respect to the radiative and\nmono-molecular current paths such that, the relative ratios of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The dashed line describes the variation\nof the ideal radiative current with pressure. The solid lines are guides to the eye.\nFig. 6. Measured spontaneous emission efficiency versus carrier density\nbelow threshold in GaInNAs SQW lasers under pressures of 0 and 13 kbar.\nArrows mark the positions corresponding to the maximum spontaneous\nemission efficiency.\n, and at in the pressure medium are 37%,\n13%, and 50%, respectively, in comparison with 45%, 15%,\nand 40% in air, with an error of %. With increasing pressure,\nit is found that the defect-related nonradiative current remains\nnearly constant in the pressure range studied, suggesting that\nthe defects are deep-levels. However, the Auger related current\ndominates and shows an unusual increase with increasing\npressure. This indicates that, based on the very simple model\nof band-to-band Auger recombination expressed by (4),\nhydrostatic pressure strongly increases the threshold carrier\ndensity in this material and this effect dominates rather than\nthe decrease in observed in InP-based materials. This can be\nattributed to the large increase in both the nonparabolicity and\nelectron effective mass in the GaInNAs material with pressure.\nIt should also be noted that, with further increasing pressure,\nthe radiative current increases more swiftly with pressure than\nthe ideal radiative current (as indicated by the dashed lines in\nFig. 5). Similarly, the Auger recombination current increases\nwith pressure. Together, these are responsible for the rapid\npressure-induced increase in at higher pressure.\nFurther evidence that it is the increase of the Auger current\nrather than the defect-related nonradiative current that occurs\nwith increasing pressure in GaInNAs is supplied by studies of\nthe spontaneous emission efficiency, which is defined by\n(7)\nFig. 7.

CONCLUSION\nIn summary, the pressure dependence of threshold current\nin 1.3- m GaInNAs lasers has been presented and compared\nwith InGaAsP and AlGaInAs lasers with the same operation\nwavelengths. In GaInNAs, the pressure-induced influence of\nthe unusual band structure on the threshold carrier density\nmust be taken into account. It is found that, the defect-related\nnonradiative current is almost constant in the pressure range\nstudied. However, the strong increase of Auger current with\nincreasing pressure above 6 kbar in this material, which is\nopposite to InGaAsP and AlGaInAs devices, is associated with\na large increase of the threshold carrier density with pressure\nas predicted by theoretical calculations. Within the band anti-\ncrossing model, the increase in the Auger current component\nwith pressure in GaInNAs is primarily the consequence of\nthe enhanced level repulsion between the GaInAs conduction\nband and the N level. Though nitrogen atoms play a crucial\nrole in reducing the bandgap of Ga(In)NAs, the high density\nof nitrogen-related defects due to the difficulty in growing\nhigh-quality material is a problem for low-threshold device\napplications. Furthermore, it is well known that, the increase of\nthe nitrogen content in Ga(In)NAs also increases the repulsive\ninteraction between the Ga(In)As conduction band and the\nN level. Our pressure results therefore imply that, further\nreducing Ga(In)NAs bandgap by increasing the N content is at\nthe cost of larger Auger effects and, therefore, larger threshold\ncurrent caused by the higher threshold carrier density due to\nthe increased electron effective mass with increasing nitrogen\ncontent.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. C.
