Differentiation is about how to \ndistinguish and analyse the components that make up any social whole: are all \nthe components essentially the same, or are they distinguishable by status or \nfunction? We argue that this approach provides a framing for IR theory that is \nmore general and integrative than narrower theories derived from Economics or \nPolitical Science. We show why this set of ideas has so far not been given much \nconsideration within IR, and how and why the one encounter between IR and \nSociology that might have changed this \u2013 Waltz\u2019s transposition of anarchy and \nfunctional differentiation from Durkheim \u2013 failed to do so. We set out in some \ndetail how differentiation theory bears on the subject matter of IR arguing that \nthis set of ideas offers new ways of looking not only at the understanding of \nstructure in IR, but also at structural change and world history. We argue that \ndifferentiation holds out to IR a major possibility for theoretical development. \nWhat is handed on from Anthropology and Sociology is mainly designed for \nsmaller and simpler subject matters than that of IR. In adapting differentiation \ntheory to its more complex, layered subject matter, IR can develop it into \nsomething new and more powerful for social theory as a whole.  \n \n \n \n \n3 \nIntroduction \n \n Except for a quite old debate around Waltz, the term \u2018differentiation\u2019 is \nrarely heard in mainstream discussions of International Relations (IR) theory, \nyet for Sociology and Anthropology it is a foundational idea for how they \ntheorize the social world. Differentiation is about how to distinguish and \nanalyse the components that make up any social whole: are all the components \nessentially the same, or are they distinguishable by status, capability or \nfunction? That this way of thinking resonates with IR is evident from terms \nsuch as \u2018like-units\u2019, \u2018sovereign equality\u2019, \u2018hegemony\u2019, \u2018great powers\u2019, \u2018empires\u2019 \nand suchlike. Yet because IR has drawn its main lines of theorizing from \nPolitical Science and Economics, where differentiation does not feature \nexplicitly, the concept has not influenced how IR conceives of its own \ntheoretical enterprise. Those two disciplines are already narrowly specialized \nbecause they are founded on the assumption that a functional differentiation \nseparating out specific \u2018political\u2019 and \u2018economic\u2019 domains, or sectors, of \nactivity has already occurred. Some people like to think of IR simply as \n\u2018International Politics\u2019 (the macro-side of Political Science), in which case the \nsingle sector framing leaves some, but not much, room for differentiation. We \nthink that Anthropology and Sociology are closer in form to IR than Political \nScience and Economics because like IR they address the human condition in \nbroader terms that range across several sectors. That IR shares this multi-\nsectoral view with Anthropology and Sociology is shown by the prominence \nwithin it of terms such as \u2018international society\u2019, \u2018world society\u2019, \u2018international \npolitical economy\u2019, \u2018international law\u2019, \u2018globalization\u2019 and the \u2018global \nenvironment\u2019. This similarity of perspective suggests that a differentiation \napproach might have something to contribute to IR. \n \n \n \n4 \n In what follows we have three specific aims: \n1. To extract a set of concepts about differentiation, and a taxonomy, from \nSociology and Anthropology, and to show how these provide a coherent \nframing for the notoriously fragmented debates about IR theory; \n2. To identify, and up to a point explore, some of the new analytical leverage \nthat this framing creates for thinking about IR generally and system structure \nin particular; and \n3. To begin thinking about how the levels of analysis issue, which is a strong \nfeature of IR theory, plays into the intellectual apparatus of differentiation, \nand vice versa.  \nOur general aim is to make a prima facie case that differentiation could make a \nmajor contribution to IR theory, and that by adapting it for this purpose, IR \nmight itself make a more significant contribution to social theory than it has \ndone so far. The next section sets out differentiation as an approach to social \ntheory. Section 3 concentrates particularly on the story of Waltz and functional \ndifferentiation. The debates around Waltz have been the main exploration of \ndifferentiation in IR, and a critique of Waltz\u2019s transposition of functional \ndifferentation from Sociology is an instructive way of showing what was \nmissed, why, and how to do the job better. Section 4 looks forward, and \noutlines the principal ways in which we think differentiation theory could be \nput to work in IR, particularly its utility for understanding structural change, \nand therefore the evolution of international systems and societies.  \n \nDifferentiation \n \n Anthropology and Sociology both make extensive use of differentiation in \ntheir theories, but they do so in ways adapted to their particular subject matter. \n \n \n \n5 \nTogether, these disciplines study the forms, processes and structures of human \nsocial organization ranging from small-scale bands and tribes up to large scale \nsocieties. The division of labour between these two disciplines is complex, and \nneed not concern us here. What is of interest is that both, like IR, study the \nsocial arrangements of humankind in a systemic way across a wide range of \nboth scales and sectors, and that they make extensive use of the concept of \ndifferentiation to do so. It is not our purpose here to go into the details of their \ninner debates. We want only to extract the essentials of the differentiation \napproach so that we can see how these might apply to the particular subject \nmatter of IR, and what the problems and benefits of such a transposition of \nconcept across disciplines might be. We are particularly conscious that the main \n(not the only) focus in Anthropology and Sociology is on systems and societies \ncomposed of individual people, whereas the main (not the only) focus in IR is \non systems and societies composed of units that are themselves systems and \nsocieties of individuals (systems of systems, or second order societies). One key \nquestion is therefore what difference does it make to think in terms of \ndifferentiation in the two-level realm of IR? \n As we see it, there are five elements of differentiation that might usefully \nbe transposed to thinking about IR: \n\u2022  A taxonomy by which different types of social structure can be classified \naccording to their dominant principle of differentiation. \n\u2022  A sense of history, closely attached to the taxonomy, in which there is a \ngeneral tendency for the simpler forms to come earlier, and the more \ncomplex ones to grow out of them.  \n\u2022  Ideas about the driving forces that push the movement from \nsmaller\/simpler to larger\/more complex social forms. \n\u2022  Ideas about what holds social forms together, especially as they become \n \n \n \n6 \nlarger and more diversified internally. \n\u2022  A tension as to whether what is being studied is the emergence of social \nform itself (more the case in Anthropology), or whether the existence of a \nsocial form \u2013 \u2018society\u2019 \u2013 is taken as given, and what is to be studied are \nthe internal dynamics of what holds it together (more the case in \nSociology).  \nWe need briefly to explain each of these elements and to suggest how they \nrelate to IR. \n Taxonomy is not currently fashionable in IR, but we think that it is \nfoundational to all theory and therefore intrinsically important. Flawed \ntaxonomy generates flawed theory. The taxonomy of differentiation can vary \nfrom author to author, but Luhmann (1982: 232-8; 1990: 423-5) is a useful \nguide because he approaches the matter in terms of basic principles, noting \n(1982: 232) that \u2018only a few forms of differentiation have been developed\u2019: \nsegmentary, stratificatory and functional. We agree that all other variants vary \nwithin these three principles, and we are attracted by the idea that these three \npotentially provide not just a unifying vocabulary, but potentially some \ntheoretical input as well, to the notoriously fragmented domain of IR theory. \n\u2022 Segmentary (or egalitarian) differentiation is where every social \nsubsystem is the equal of, and functionally similar to every other social \nsubsystem. In Anthropology and Sociology this points to families, bands, \nclans and tribes. In IR it points to anarchic systems of states as \u2018like \nunits\u2019. Segmentation is the simplest form of social differentiation, though \nthat does not mean that societies of this type are in any general sense \nsimple. Like all human social constructs they are capable of great \nelaboration and complexity. As Durkheim (1968: 79-80, 84-5, 105-7) \nargues it, such \u2018mechanical\u2019 societies are held together, indeed defined \n \n \n \n7 \nby, a collective conscience, which is \u2018the totality of beliefs and \nsentiments common to average citizens of the same society\u2019. This totality, \nwhich today we would discuss as \u2018identity\u2019, transcends the individuals \nthat compose it and so operates as an independent structure across space \nand time. A segmentary form of differentiation is the one most prone to \nbe organized in terms of territorial delimitations, although this is not \nnecessarily so.  \n\u2022 Stratificatory differentiation is where some persons or groups raise \nthemselves above others, creating a hierarchical social order. \nStratificatory differentiation covers a wide range of possibilities and can \nbe further subdivided into rank and class forms distinguished by whether \nor not there is significant inequality not just in status (rank), but in access \nto basic resources (class). In Anthropology and Sociology this points to \nfeudal or caste or aristocratic or military social orders, though it can also \nbe about the conquest and absorption of some units by others (Johnson \nand Earle, 2000: 35). As this suggests, stratification can occur in many \ndimensions: coercive capability, access to resources, authority, status. In \nIR it points to the many forms of hierarchy: conquest and empire, \nhegemony, a privileged position for great powers, and a division of the \nworld into core and periphery1, or first and third worlds.2 Collective \nconscience applies here too, but with the additional element that \nstratification must be accepted as legitimate. However, the lower the \ndegree of legitimacy, the higher the necessity to maintain a stratified \norder by force.3 \n\u2022 Functional differentiation is where the subsystems are defined by the \ncoherence of particular types of activity and their differentiation from \nother types of activity, and these differences do not stem simply from \n \n \n \n8 \nrank. The idea was initially drawn from biological metaphors about the \ndifferent subsystems that compose living organisms (Durkheim, 1968: \n41, 125, 127, 271). Functional differentiation is mainly studied in \nSociology where it is generally thought of as the essential characteristic \nof modernity. It is closely related to the idea of a division of labour in the \nsense understood by economists, but when applied to society as a whole \nit points to its increasing division into legal, political, military, economic, \nscientific, religious and suchlike distinct and specialised subsystems or \nsectors of activity, often with distinctive institutions and actors. \nDurkheim (1968: 56, 64-5, 267, 274) argues that through a logic of \ninterdependence and non-competition the functional differentiation of a \ndivision of labour itself generates a new form or social solidarity which \nhe labels \u2018organic\u2019. The practice of thinking in terms of functionally \ndifferentiated sectors is not uncommon (See Braudel,1985: 17; \nMann,1986: ch. 1). In IR functional differentiation points, inter alia, to \ninternational political economy (IPE), international law, world (or global \ncivil) society, transnational actors, and the debates about \ndeterritorialization, a set of elements that have so far lacked a unifying \nconcept in IR theory debates (other than the extremely loose one of \n\u2018globalization\u2019).  \n The sense of history in differentiation involves an idea of evolution in \nwhich more complex forms grow out of the simpler ones that precede them: \nsegmentary hunter-gatherer bands precede the stratified city states and empires \nof ancient and classical times, which precede the functionally differentiated \nsocieties characteristic of modernity (Luhmann, 1990: 423ff; see also \nDurkheim, 1968: 256, 277, 283). In this view, segmentary, stratificatory and \nfunctional differentiation form a sequence in that the higher tiers depend for \n \n \n \n9 \ntheir existence on having developed out of, and overcome, the one that came \nbefore. The sequence is thus both empirical (roughly corresponding to the \ngeneral pattern of human history) and qualitative (from simpler forms of \ndifferentiation to more complex ones). Although such evolution is common, it \nis certainly not inevitable. Specific societies can end up in stasis, or can revert \nback to simpler types. Evolution does not mean that higher forms of \ndifferentiation totally eliminate those below them. The logic is structural: social \norders are characterized by the co-presence of different forms of differentiation, \nthe key question being which form is dominant in shaping the social structure \nas a whole (Durkheim, 1968: 260-61; Luhmann, 1982: 242-5). This co-presence \nframing is immediately apparent in contemporary society, where it is easy to \nidentify all three types of differentiation in simultaneous operation. It puts into \ncontext the debates in IR about the nature and direction of the contemporary \ninternational system which seems to contain elements of all three forms, with \nthe dominant segmentary one (territorial states, sovereign equality, anarchy) \nbeing questioned by both stratificatory elements (the return of empire, \nhegemony, core-periphery) and functional ones (globalization, \ndeterritorialization, transnational actors, an increasingly autonomous global \neconomy). More generally, it provides an overall framing for thinking about not \njust how states evolve, but about how the whole international system\/society \nhas developed, and what the relationship between these two levels might be \nboth historically and now. \n Underlying this sense of history are theories about the driving forces that \npush societies from simpler to more complex forms of differentiation. One of \nthese is Durkheim\u2019s idea of dynamic density as the driving force pushing \nsocieties from a segmentary to a functionally differentiated form (Durkheim, \n1968; 257-64; Barkdull, 1995: 669-74). Although Larkins (1994: 249) \n \n \n \n10 \ndismisses dynamic density as a weak concept, it is in fact central to Durkheim\u2019s \nwhole argument. He hypothesised that \u2018the division of labor varies in direct \nratio with the volume and density of societies, and, if it progresses in a \ncontinuous manner in the course of social development, it is because societies \nbecome regularly denser and generally more voluminous\u2026.[T]he growth and \ncondensation of societies\u2026necessitate a greater division of labour\u2026.it is its \ndetermining cause.\u2019(Durkheim, 1968: 262). This is a materialist theory claiming \nthat as the numbers of people in a society increases, contact and interaction also \nincrease, and the social structure moves from simple and segmentary to a more \ncomplex division of labour. As this movement occurs, the basis of social \nsolidarity automatically shifts from mechanical (collective consciousness) to \norganic (functional differentiation). \n This type of thinking is particularly well developed in Anthropology \nwhich has many cases of failure (social collapse) to consider, as well as \nevolutionary successes that move up the differentiation ladder. Johnson and \nEarle (2000: 14-37) posit population growth and technological evolution \ninteracting with each other within the context of environmental constraints, as \nthe \u2018primary engine\u2019 of social evolution. Larger and more technologically \ncapable societies make more demands on their environments, and when \nenvironmental limits are reached, this can lead to stasis or collapse (Diamond, \n2005; Wright, 2004). The basic story, however, is one of evolutionary increase \nin size and complexity. As size increases, complexity and differentiation \nbecome necessary to deal with collective problems such as food storage, \ndefence, trade and capital investment that are beyond the capacity of smaller, \nsimpler units. This in turn drives societies up the differentiation ladder from \nsegmentary through stratificatory to functional differentiation in \u2018an iterative \nprocess of social evolution\u2019 (Johnson and Earle, 2000: 29). It is not difficult to \n \n \n \n11 \nsee how theorizing along these lines could be related to IR concerns about \nthings ranging from the evolution of international systems\/societies, through the \nstrategic consequences of population and technological innovation, to whether \nor not humankind is playing its last and greatest game with environmental \ncarrying capacity. \n The last two elements of differentiation theory \u2013 what holds social forms \ntogether; and whether the study of differentiation should be focused on how \nsocieties emerge, or on how existing societies cohere \u2013 are so interwoven that it \nis easiest to consider them together. This is a rather complicated issue which \nhas substantive implications for how differentiation theory can be transposed to \nthe subject matter of IR. It hinges on the move up to functional differentiation, \nand since that move is mainly in the domain of Sociology, the easiest way to \nexplain what is at stake is to look briefly at how the debate unfolded in \nSociology. We will again simplify, looking only to draw out the essentials \nrelevant to IR, and not to attempt a full portrait of the debates in Sociology.  \n Classical Sociology has been largely concerned with the impact of \nmodernity on national societies. Modernity has been mainly conceived as the \nshift from stratificatory to functional differentiation. In this framing, society \nwas something that existed before functional differentiation became dominant. \nThe marker for society was the existence of shared beliefs and sentiments, \nDurkheim\u2019s collective conscience, that both gave social cohesion to a particular \ngroup of people and differentiated them from other cultures. This concept of \nsociety leaned strongly towards Gemeinschaft (community), understanding it as \nsomething evolved, historic, and old. From that starting point, the problem was \nhow the cohesion of such societies could survive the ever more pervasive \nimpact of modernity as functional differentiation. What unites the classical \nworks of Sociology, ranging from Herbert Spencer (1968) and Emile Durkheim \n \n \n \n12 \n(1968), through Georg Simmel (1908) and Max Weber (1968), to Talcott \nParsons (1961, 1967) and Niklas Luhmann (1997), is that modernization and \nthe evolution of society in general are seen in terms of a continuing \nspecialization of tasks and the division of labour in society. Although \u2018not all \nsocial change is differentiation\u2019 (Alexander, 1990: 1), the \u2018differentiation of \ntasks in society \u2013 or the division of labour \u2013 is a central focus of sociology\u2019 \n(Holmwood, 2006: 142). The puzzle was whether the increasingly elaborate \ndivision of labour in modern societies would destroy the traditional \n(mechanical, identity) cohesion that defined what society was, or would itself \nserve as the basis for a new type of (organic) social whole that was defined by \nthe interdependence of its division of labour.  \n  The responses to this puzzle went in two directions: decomposition and \nemergence. Some saw functional differentiation to mean a process of a \ndecomposition of society in which the stability of a pre-existing cultural entity \nis compromised by an evolution that decomposes it into ever more specialized \nunits, subsystems, and roles. If society was viewed as community and shared \nculture (Gemeinschaft), then functional differentiation was corrosive. The \nimportance of the organic, evolved identity in Sociology underpinned the \nconcerns of those such as T\u00f6nnies (1887) and Gellner (1988: 61) who worried \nabout the loss of Gemeinschaft in the transition to modernity and Gesellschaft \n(society as something instrumental, contractual and constructed). Crucial to this \nview is an account of what it is in the first place that makes society hang \ntogether as a whole despite ongoing processes of differentiation. This social \nglue is variously referred to as \u2018collective conscience\u2019 (Durkheim), a \u2018societal \ncommunity\u2019 (Parsons), or a \u2018lifeworld\u2019 (Habermas), all of which point to the \nrealm of shared values and norms. These cultural bonds act as the counterforce \nto the centrifugal tendencies of functional differentiation that were perhaps \n \n \n \n13 \nmost graphically captured by Marx\u2019s idea of class war.  \n Others, most notably Weber and later Luhmann saw functional \ndifferentiation as a process of emergence (see Schimank and Volkmann, 1999: \n8ff). In other words, it is the processes of functional differentiation itself \u2013 the \nemergence of recognisably different spheres of politics, law, economics, \nreligion etc. \u2013 which account for the existence of society as a \u2018social whole\u2019 in \nthe first place (see Nassehi, 2004). If society was viewed as Gesellschaft, then \nfunctional differentiation was integral to its existence, not antagonistic to it. \nDurkheim is in the middle, seeing decomposition as a necessary condition for \nemergence. Functional differentiation then does not mean that an integrated \nwhole is somehow decomposed, but rather that as society evolves into \nfunctional differentiation it undergoes a process of newly emerging structures \nand systems. These systems build \u2018global accounts\u2019 of the world, i.e. the \nfunctionally differentiated political system reconstructs the world in terms of \npower, the legal system reconstructs the world in terms of legal\/illegal, the \nscientific system in terms of true\/false, etc. Luhmann completes this turn by \nasserting that society (which for him cannot be anything but world society) can \nonly appear as such because it is internally differentiated, i.e. there is no \n\u2018integrating\u2019 force in addition to the form of functional differentiation itself. \n Several points of relevance to transposing differentiation theory into IR \nemerge from these debates in Sociology: \n\u2022 The decomposition view has little relevance for IR because IR does not start \nfrom the assumption that any sort of international society is already in \nexistence. IR is very much in the emergence camp, with international society \nnot taken as given, but having to be constructed. Most of the IR mainstream \nstarts from the assumption that the system of states is only minimally a \nsociety (in the recognition of sovereign equality in a segmentary\/anarchic \n \n \n \n14 \nstructure), and mainly a stratified hierarchical system in which order rests on \nthe use of force by great powers. \n\u2022 Yet while the decomposition view does not fit well with IR, its idea of \nsociety as community, involving shared values and identity, is prominent in \nIR. The English school\u2019s whole idea of international society is based on \nshared norms, rules and institutions, and many constructivists and thinkers \nabout global civil society also focus on the development of shared norms as \nthe key to social theory approaches to IR \u2013 most obviously democratic peace \ntheory. \n\u2022 Despite the better fit for IR of the emergence view, there has as yet been \nlittle explicit thinking in IR about social structure as a property of functional \ndifferentiation. Some elements of IPE, world society, and globalization \nthinking lean this way implicitly, but since mainstream IR has hardly \nengaged with functional differentiation, the path to this type of thinking \nremains largely unexplored. \n We conclude that both lines of thinking about society \u2013 whether as shared \nculture and values, or as a structural property of functional differentiation \u2013 are \nrelevant to IR. We also conclude that the emergence view of society fits well \nwith the needs of IR, and that therefore the bad fit with decomposition doesn\u2019t \nmatter. Indeed, there is no reason why the shared culture and values view of \nsociety cannot be compatible with emergence. Here IR is better lined up with \nthe anthropological view of differentiation which is more about how societies \ndevelop and expand. There is no reason why one cannot look at the emergence \nof shared values and culture as an act of social construction. Rather than an \norganic Gemeinschaft being threatened by an instrumental Gesellschaft, the \nreverse is also possible, where the construction and operation of an instrumental \nGesellschaft paves the way to a shared culture Gemeinschaft. \n \n \n \n15 \n \nWhy IR Theory has not Engaged with Differentiation  \n \n Since differentiation theory seems to offer considerable riches to IR, the \nnext question to answer is why mainstream IR has shown so little interest in it. \nSome sociologists have argued for the need to extend the discipline\u2019s purview \nto the international and global realm (Moore, 1966; Smelser, 1997), but nothing \nmuch has been done. A current mainstream textbook on so-called \u2018Global \nSociology\u2019 (Cohen & Kennedy, 2007) has no index references to any aspect of \ndifferentiation, nor, indeed, to international society. The works of the Stanford \nschool (Meyer et al., 1997) and Niklas Luhmann\u2019s work on \u2018world society\u2019 \n(Luhmann, 1997, 2000a) both address \u2018world society\u2019, neither is widely read or \nunderstood within IR. There have been several other sociological approaches to \nIR, which we do not have the space to review. The point is that while most were \nrooted in accounts of differentiation, none of them imported the idea into IR.  \n There is some irony in the fact that mainstream IR\u2019s principal engagment \nwith functional differentiation was initiated by Kenneth Waltz, the founding \nfather of an approach to IR which is about as far from \u2018sociological\u2019 as one \ncould get: Neorealism. Although Waltz borrowed some arguments from \nDurkheim, his main inspiration was microeconomics, and his main aim was to \nbuild a materialist, not a social theory of international politics. Thus the one \nserious engagement with differentiation in IR was developed in such a way as \nto close off the main lines of theoretical significance. \n Waltz\u2019s theory is entirely one of international politics. Using Durkheim for \nauthority, and levels of analysis as a weapon, Waltz first confines functional \ndifferentiation to the functions of government (essentially therefore about \nsovereignty). He then adopts a definition that relegates this exclusively political \n \n \n \n16 \nfunctional differentiation to hierarchic systems, and banishes it from anarchic \nones (Waltz, 1979: 104, 115, 197; 1986: 323-30; 2004: 98-9). This move \nprivileges territoriality along the lines of segmentary differentiation: the \u2018like \nunits\u2019 on which Waltz (1979: 97) builds his vision of anarchic structure. The \nprominence Waltz accords to the absence of functional differentiation in the \ninternational system of states reinforces Parson\u2019s (1961: 241) view of the \ninternational domain as a \u2018social system\u2019, not developed enough to be a proper \nsociety. By removing the social element, Waltz reduces the status of the whole \nto a mere system (Larkins, 1994, 249-53; Barkdull, 1995: 674-6). By driving \nfunctional differentiation exclusively into domestic politics, Waltz\u2019s theory \nexplicitly removes it from IR theory. This move was challenged by Ruggie \n(1983. See also Barkdull, 1995; Buzan and Little, 1996, 2000), but the IR \ndebate about functional differentiation nonetheless took place entirely within \nthe political sector, closing the door on its more general meaning. \n Waltz and Ruggie also contested over the role of another Durkheim \nconcept, dynamic density, and the role of increasing social interaction in \ngenerating structural change in society. As we showed above, dynamic density \nis a materialist theory of the driving forces that push development up the ladder \nof differentiation. As Ruggie, Barkdull, and Buzan and Little all see it, by \nimporting Durkheim\u2019s model Waltz necessarily brought with it the logic that a \nrising volume and intensity of social interaction must inevitably drive society \nfrom mechanical\/segmentary\/simple (like units) to organic\/functionally \ndifferentiated\/complex. If dynamic density is increasing within the international \ndomain, as it unarguably is, then it undermines one of the key elements in \nWaltz\u2019s theory: that anarchy (i.e. a mechanical\/segmentary\/simple social \nstructure) is a stable and self-reproducing form. Durkheim\u2019s theory of dynamic \ndensity opens Waltz\u2019s scheme to the arguments of interdependence theorists \n \n \n \n17 \nand globalizationists that the rapid increase in material density and social \nvolume is the defining feature of the contemporary international system. That \nlogic points to the instability of anarchic structure, opening the door to those \nsuch as Milner (1991) and Cerny (1993, 1995a, 1995b, 2000) who want to \nargue that the international system is indeed transforming from a simple \nanarchy with no functional differentiation into at least the beginnings of a \ndivision of labour in which functional differentiation in both Waltz\u2019s narrow \nsense, and the wider one of Sociology, is becoming more conspicuous. This \nthreatens not only the stability of Waltz\u2019s anarchy, but also his confinement of \nfunctional differentiation to the political sphere.  \n Although both Waltz (2004: 99) and Ruggie (1983: 262) noted the \ntransposition of Durkheim\u2019s structural logic from the unit level to the \ninternational system level, there was no consideration of whether this might be \nproblematic. Waltz (2004: 99) simply takes Durkheim\u2019s distinction between \nmechanical (segmentary) and organic (functionally differentiated) societies and \ntransposes it directly, saying that mechanical ones represent \u2018the anarchic order \nof international politics\u2019 and organic ones \u2018the hierarchic order of domestic \npolitics\u2019 (Barkdull, 1995: 674-6). Waltz (2004: 99) also follows Durkheim\u2019s \nanalysis that structural transformation from mechanical to organic is a conflict-\nladen process which establishes forms of stratification in addition to functional \ndifferentiation. Here the stronger units in the mechanical society impose a \ndivision of labour (e.g. the core-periphery of the world economy) on the weaker \nones thus imposing both hierarchy and functional differentiation.  \n To gain some perspective on this transposition it is useful to return to the \ndifferentiation taxonomy set out earlier: segmentary, stratificatory and \nfunctional. Durkheim\u2019s mechanical society transposes pretty neatly onto \nsegmentary, but his organic one is either effectively a jump to functional \n \n \n \n18 \ndifferentiation (given Durkheim\u2019s interest in the division of labour), or a \nconflation of stratificatory and functional differentiation. Either way, the \ndifference between Durkheim\u2019s dyad and the triad of differentiation matters \nwhen it comes to Waltz\u2019s transposition. Because Waltz has narrowed the \nmeaning of functional differentiation down into the purely political (functions \nof government, sovereignty), his reading of Durkheim can only go from \nsegmentary to stratificatory. Being purely political, Waltz\u2019s \u2018functional \ndifferentiation\u2019 is not, and cannot be, functional differentiation in the \nsociological meaning because only one sector \u2013 politics \u2013 is in play. It can only \nbe stratificatory differentiation, a point underlined by Waltz\u2019s focus on great \npowers and polarity. In this sense Waltz\u2019s political understanding of \u2018functional \ndifferentiation\u2019 leads exactly to the political differentiation within anarchy that \nseveral IR authors have developed: Ruggie (1983, 1993) in his thinking about \nthe medieval system and the EU; Watson (1990, 1992) in his pendulum theory \nof international order; and Buzan and Little (1996; 2000) about political \ndifferentiation in world history from empires, city-states and barbarians to the \ncentre-periphery structure of European colonialism. Stratificatory \ndifferentiation, with its emphasis on unequal status, opens up precisely the \nblurring of anarchy and hierarchy that Waltz was so keen to avoid.   \n Although it opens up some interesting insights, this repositioning of \nWaltz still leaves unanswered the legitimacy of the whole transposition of \nDurkheim to the international system in the first place. The near silence on this \npoint is deeply ironic given that it is fundamentally a question about levels of \nanalysis, an issue on which IR theory is well primed, and about which Waltz is \nthe undisputed king. Yet in this instance Waltz simply assumes that the basic \nstructural idea will apply regardless of level. How tenable is this assumption? \nThe obvious difficulty with it is that the segmentary\/mechanical form is lifted \n \n \n \n19 \nfrom a sociological context in which Durkheim understood it as a type of \nsociety integrated by a shared identity (Larkins, 1994: 252), and moved to an IR \none in which it is understood as a mere system, operating mechanically as an \nanarchic struggle for power\/survival without any integrating social content. \nDurkheim\u2019s label of mechanical facilitates Waltz\u2019s dumping of the shared \nidentity element, and thus society, but as the more neutral label segmentary \nunderlines, the segmentary\/mechanical form of differentiation still has to be \nunderstood as a type of society. That is to say it must possess social cohesion \nand some sense of being a whole. Durkheim\u2019s linking of mechanical solidarity \nwith repressive sanctions against challengers to the collective conscience did \nnot suggest that this social element was thin in mechanical societies (Durkheim, \n1968: 84-5, 106).  \n Because the shift from international system to international society is \nimportant both as an evolutionary step and as a basic conceptualisation, Waltz\u2019s \ntransposition across levels from domestic society to the international system is \nin trouble. Durkheim\u2019s mechanical\/segmentary logic presupposes a social \ncontext, whereas Waltz\u2019s anarchic system one precisely does not. This problem, \nas Barkdull (1995: 674) argues, largely stems from Waltz\u2019 confusion about \u2018the \nrelationship between anarchy and hierarchy on the one hand and mechanical \nand organic solidarity on the other\u2019. It could thus be argued that reading \nDurkheim in an international context would actually support the idea that the \ninternational system, even under the \u2018weak\u2019 condition of mechanical solidarity, \nis already a social context, i.e. an international society, and not an asocial \ninternational system. Barkdull (1995: 677) rightly in our view, goes so far as to \nsay that Waltz must accept international society if he wants to claim \nDurkheim\u2019s authority for his theory.  \n \n \n \n20 \n By transposing from Durkheim, Waltz thus offers two rich gifts to his \ncritics. The first is that if the segmentary analogy is carried across from the \ndomestic to the international level, then the holistic element of society must be \ncarried with it as well. Via Durkheim, Waltz opens the door to both \ninternational and world society, validating the foundations not just of the \nEnglish school but also of many constructivists. This in turn raises the question \nof how ideas about society can be transposed from the domestic realm to the \ninternational one. In Sociology, it is mostly individuals who are the constitutive \nelements of society, and even in segmentary societies it is individuals that carry \nthe collective conscience that unites the \u2018like units\u2019. Although some of IR \ntheory is reductionist in this way, much of it is based on methodological \ncollectivism, in which states and other collective entities are treated as actors It \nis far from clear how concepts like Durkheim\u2019s collective conscience can be \ncarried across from first-order societies (individuals as members) to second-\norder ones (collective actors as members). In interstate society it is the \ncollective \u2018like units\u2019 of the society (states) that share identity (sovereign \nequality, or at a higher level, democracy), not necessarily the individual human \nbeings within them. This distinctive quality of international society does not as \nfar as we can see, have any clear analogues in sociological theory.  \n The second gift, as already hinted above, is that Waltz cannot really get \naway with squeezing everything out of Durkheim\u2019s model except politics. For \nbetter or worse, a differentiation approach brings the whole spectrum of human \nactivity with it, not just politics, but economics, law, religion and all. Though \nneither uses the language of functional differentiation, this validates both \nEnglish school solidarists, who deal with human rights and economic issues, \nand globalizationists, whose mode of analysis is sufficiently multi-faceted that \nit begins to close the gap between how networks of complex interdependence \n \n \n \n21 \nwork in the international system, and functional differentiation as understood \nby sociologists. By using Durkheim, Waltz undermines his own narrowing to \nthe political, and opens the way for those wanting to take a much wider view of \nwhat comprises an international system\/society, and therefore of what IR is \nactually about.  \n We can see, therefore, that both Waltz and much of the debate around \nhim, constitute a wrong turn in relation to the discussion of functional \ndifferentiation in IR. By reducing functional differentiation to something within \npolitics only, and then confining it to the unit level, Waltz and those who \nfollowed his lead basically ended up using the terminology of functional \ndifferentiation to talk about the difference between segmentary (anarchic) and \nstratificatory (hierarchic) systems. This wrong turn, while not quite a dead-end, \nhas pre-empted a proper discussion of functional differentiation in IR by \nstealing its clothes. IR readings of Waltz\u2019 work have mainly followed his \nreduction of functional differentiation to a \u2018within politics\u2019 meaning. This \nmeans that the repeated calls to roll back Waltz\u2019s closure of functional \ndifferentiation (Ruggie, 1983; Buzan et al., 1993: 238-40; S\u00f8rensen, 2000) have \nnot addressed the full question. Even some of those IR conceptualizations that \nchallenge the idea that international relations can adequately be described in \nterms of an anarchically structured system of states have neglected the issue of \nfunctional differentiation (World Society Research Group, 2000; Bull, 1977; \nBuzan, 2004).  \n The wrong turn initiated by Waltz does not, however, stand in the way of \nIR now taking up the full meaning of differentiation. Despite the hegemony of \nWaltz\u2019s narrow interpretation, functional differentiation in its wider meaning \nhas been explicitly addressed within IR in a couple of places marginal to the \nmainstream. One of these is in IR readings of the Luhmannian concept of world \n \n \n \n22 \nsociety (Albert and Hilkermeier, 2004). Another is the work of Cerny who \nfollows Waltz\u2019s link to Durkheim in order to critique Neorealism. Cerny (1993: \n36-7) argues that the international system is moving from simple (segmentary) \nto complex (functional) differentiation. These works point the way to the idea \nthat Waltz\u2019s use of Durkheim might open the door to a much wider use of \ndifferentiation in IR. How might mainstream IR pursue a theoretical \ndevelopment along these lines? \n \nLooking Forward: Differentiation as IR Theory \n \n In this section we focus on how differentiation fits into IR theory debates, \nand what agendas its adoption would open up. The re-engagement of IR with \ndifferentiation has to begin with recognition of the three lessons learned from \nthe critique of Waltz. First, that the use of differentiation carries with it the \nassumption of society. Second that to confine functional differentiation to the \npolitical sector takes away most of its useful meaning. Rather than using \nfunctional differentiation to look inward into the political sector, as Waltz did, \nwe need to use it to look outward into the international system\/society across \nsectors, and to aim at understanding the whole of which the political sector is \nbut one functionally differentiated part.4 And third, that one cannot transpose \ndifferentiation into IR without thinking hard about the difference made by \nmoving from the domestic to the international level of analysis. With these \nlessons in mind, we return to the taxonomy of differentiation, and the analytical \nideas associated with it, set out at the beginning of this article with a view to \nillustrating in more detail both the issues they raise for IR theory and the \ncontributions they might make to it.   \n Perhaps the major contribution of differentiation to IR is that it offers a \n \n \n \n23 \nnovel taxonomy for thinking about the structure of both units and systems. \nTaxonomy is foundational to all theory because it sets up what it is that is to be \nunderstood and\/or explained. The taxonomy of differentiation both maps onto \nand enriches the dominant concepts in IR. As we have shown, segmentary maps \nonto anarchic, and stratificatory onto hierarchic. But functional differentiation, \nwhen properly understood, is both an additional form of structure and a radical \ndeparture from the anarchy-hierarchy dyad. Unlike other attempts to break away \nfrom the dominance of the anarchy-hierarchy dyad \u2013 Ruggie\u2019s (1983) \n\u2018heteronomy\u2019, Deudney\u2019s (2007: 48-9) \u2018negarchy\u2019 or Watson\u2019s (1990, 1992) \nspectrum of anarchy, hegemony, suzerainty, dominion, empire \u2013 functional \ndifferentiation moves beyond the political sector.5 It opens up a concept of \nstructure that embraces rather than denies wider understandings of international \nsystems\/societies incorporating the whole range of sectors. To get a sense of \nhow the adoption of this approach might play into IR thinking it is necessary \nfirst to think about the transposition problem of moving differentiation from the \nmainly domestic level, to the international system\/society level.  \n What difference does it make for applying differentiation concepts that the \nsubject matter of IR is mainly at the international system\/society level rather \nthan at the domestic one? There are two ways of thinking about this question. \nThe first is relatively simple: since there are two levels in play in IR, one needs \nto apply the structural questions of differentiation to both, asking not just how \nthe individual units are differentiated internally, but also how the international \nsystem\/society as a whole is differentiated. Standard answers to these questions \nmight be that the leading units display quite advanced degrees of functional \ndifferentiation, while the international system remains a mixture of segmentary \n(sovereign equality) and stratificatory (hegemony). Does this difference in the \ndominant mode of differentiation across the levels matter? Does the disjuncture \n \n \n \n24 \ncreate tension and constitute a driving force for change? Should we expect the \nleading units to project their domestic form of differentiation into the system as \na whole? This offers an interesting new dimension to the classic problem \nidentified by Wight (1966) and Walker (1993) of inside\/outside in IR theory. It \nalso offers a pathway into setting up a structural analysis for the \nterritorialization\/deterritorialization problematique in globalization, which can \nbe quite nicely framed as a set of tensions among the different types and levels \nof differentiation.  \n The two levels framing of differentiation in IR also means that segmentary \ndifferentiation itself has to be reconsidered. In Sociology and Anthropology, \nsegmentary differentiation represents the simple\/primitive end of the \ndifferentiation spectrum. But IR starts from collective units and works up to \ninternational systems and societies, and in this perspective segmentary \ndifferentiation at the system level can become much more sophisticated because \nthe \u2018like units\u2019 that compose it may themselves have very complex and \nsophisticated modes of differentiation within them. A segmentary \ndifferentiation based on units that are functionally differentiated internally is \nneither simple nor primitive. A two-level perspective on differentiation along \nthese lines points towards second-order societies, where the entities that \ncompose international society are not individuals but collective units. This \nframing moves into the terrain of the English school and of constructivists such \nas Wendt, where differentiation offers additional analytical tools for thinking \nabout international society. It raises, for example, the question of how the \ndifferent modes of differentiation both within states and at the system level, \nplay into the rise, evolution and obsolescence of the institutions of international \nsociety studied by Holsti (2004). Specifically, if great powers are the key \ngenerators of such institutions, can one link the nature of their own internal \n \n \n \n25 \ndifferentiation to the specific types of institutions that they promote and \nsupport? The suggestive evidence for such a link is strong. Colonialism and \ngreat power management surely link to stratificatory differentiation, sovereign \nequality and nationalism to segmentary differentiation, and the market and \ninternational law to functional differentiation. \n Pushing this line of thought even further leads to the second way of \nresponding to the levels problem. If the international system level is \nsegmentary, or even stratificatory, then it is still possible to stay within a state-\ncentric model of international system\/society. In IR terms, segmentary \ndifferentiation embodies the central place that territoriality occupies in much \nthinking about IR \u2013 and not just in IR: as Scholte (2000: 56-61) points out, \n\u2018methodological territorialism\u2019 is also strong in Economics, Sociology, Politics \nand Geography. Stratificatory differentiation is clearly present in the interstate \ndomain in the privileges of great powers in interstate society. An interesting \nliterature has arisen about the tension between the strong (segmentary) \nlegitimacy principle of sovereign equality, versus the prevalent (stratificatory) \npractice of hegemony, which although crucial to international order, lacks any \naccepted legitimating principle (Watson, 1992: 299-309, 319-25; 1997; Clark, \n1989; Hurrell, 2007: 287-98). \n Moving to the idea that there is any serious functional differentiation at the \nsystem level would have major implications for what kind of units are in play. It \nwould almost certainly require a move away from state-centric models of the \ninternational system\/society towards ones where non-state actors, whether firms \nor civil society associations, and even individuals, have standing as units. This \npoints to work from IPE such as Cerny\u2019s, already mentioned, and Stopford and \nStrange (1991); from \u2018world society\u2019 thinking in the English school and \nelsewhere which bring both state and non-state actors into the picture (see \n \n \n \n26 \nBuzan, 2004: 27-89); and from the globalization literature that points to \ndeterritorialization as the principle trend in global politics (Scholte, 2000), and \na global civil society of nonstate, often transnational, actors (Anheier et al., \n2001). Thinking about more diverse types of entity in international relations \nalso opens up another perspective on segmentary differentiation, which is that it \nmight apply not just to states as argued above, but to other formations such as \nnations, religions and civilizations that often do not line up with state \nboundaries. In these ways, opening up the system level to functional \ndifferentiation is a radical move. It raises interesting questions about what the \nwhole is that is being differentiated (Albert, 2007), and it shifts attention from \narguments about what units compose the international system\/society, to what \nthe underlying structure of society is of which the units are an expression.  \n Yet despite the limited use of functional differentiation in IR, it is far from \nan alien way of thinking. IR is riddled with unconscious usages of functional \ndifferentiation-like formulations: \u2018the international economic system\u2019, \n\u2018international law\u2019, \u2018the international political system\u2019, \u2018international society\u2019, \nand indeed the very divisions amongst the disciplines within the social sciences \nreflect a logic of functional differentation indicate thinking in terms of sectoral \ndivisions of the subject. Realists from Morgenthau to Waltz talk firmly in terms \nof political theory, assuming that dividing the subject into sectors is a necessary \ncondition for effective theory-building, and therefore necessarily, but silently, \npresupposing that some social whole exists from which politics has been \ndifferentiated. In Security Studies, thinking about security in terms of sectors \u2013 \nmilitary, economic, political, societal, environmental \u2013 has been around since \nthe 1980s and has now become a standard way of organizing texts. All of this \nno doubt indicates a less deep understanding of functional differentiation than \nthe division of labour prominent in most sociological theories, but it is \n \n \n \n27 \nnonetheless substantial enough to fuel liberal, IPE, globalizationist, \nWallersteinian, dependencia, English school, much critical theory, and some \nconstructivist rebellions against the state- and politics-centric orthodoxies of \nRealism. Ruggie\u2019s response to Waltz, especially in his linkage of how private \nproperty and sovereignty defined the transition from medieval to modern can \nalso be read as a rejection of an exclusively political understanding of IR. At \nstake here is the meta question for IR theory of what constitutes international \nsystem\/society. Is it states as the dominant unit, and thus segmentary and\/or \nstratificatory differentiation? Or has functional\/sectoral differentiation \nproceeded sufficiently that international system\/society can only be understood \nadequately as comprised by different types of actors interacting across several \nsectors?  \n If functional differentiation is already implicit in IR, what would it look \nlike if made more explicit? Specifically, how would functional differentiation at \nthe system level play against segmentary and stratificatory differentiation? In \nsociological theory one form of differentiation has to be dominant even though \nall may be present. The process of modernity is understood as having elevated \nfunctional differentiation to the fore within advanced industrial societies, \ncreating the tensions noted above for the decompositionalists who worry that \nthis development threatens the shared identity developed in earlier times. Much \nof the discussion about international relations rests on the assumption that \neither segmentary (anarchic) or stratificatory (hegemony-empire) differentiation \nremains the dominant form. This is even the view of Milner (1991) and Cerny \n(1993), who like some globalizationists see functional differentiation only as an \nemergent quality of the international system\/sociey, not (yet) as the dominant \none. Given the absence of a pre-existing society in IR, analysis of functional \ndifferentiation at the system level cannot follow the decomposition line and \n \n \n \n28 \nmust therefore think in terms of emergence. Although the emergence view, as \nnoted, can be transposed to IR, in some other ways the subject matter of IR, and \nspecifically the issues posed by operating at the international system level, open \nnew ground not explored in sociological debates. An emergent functional \ndifferentiation plays against existing segementary and stratificatory forms, but \nnot against a Gemeinschaft society covering the whole system as it would have \nto do in Durkheim\u2019s scheme. Any emergence of functional differentiation at the \nglobal level would have to play into the Gesellschaft international society \nestablished by states. \n Although the mainstream IR view is almost certainly that functional \ndifferentiation is emergent but not dominant at the system level, Luhmann \n(1982, 1997; see also Stetter, 2008; Albert, Kessler and Stetter, 2008) offers a \nview in which it is. He posits a \u2018world society\u2019 composed of subsystems of \ncommunication each of which is organised around a distinct social function: \nlegal, political, economic, scientific, religious and suchlike. In this theory, the \nsegmentary and stratificatory differentiations are pushed into the background, \nseen as only having residual importance in the political and legal subsystems \nwhere territoriality (i.e. segmentary differentiation) still matters. Luhmann \n(1982: 242-5) sees politics as the great survivor of segmentary differentiation \nand, to a lesser degree, class as the survivor of stratificatory differentiation \nwithin a world society now dominated by functional differentiation. This world \nsociety is still thought of as a society because, like Durkheim\u2019s organic \nsolidarity, it is the logic of functional differentiation itself, and the need for \neach subsystem to adjust to the environment created by the others, that \ncomposes society. The Luhmannian view is almost certainly too radical to find \nwidespread support in IR, both because it dissolves the unit-system distinction, \nand because most people coming from IR would find its marginalization of \n \n \n \n29 \nterritoriality and agency implausible. But it does serve as a useful foil for \nanyone wanting to think about what the dominance of functional differentiation \nwould look like at the system level. \n Would functional differentiation break down segmentary by undoing the \nterritorial packaging of the state? Or reinforce it by pushing the development of \nmore elaborate forms of international society in which states remain the \nprincipal units, but do so within more open arrangements allowing room and \nrights for a range of non-state actors? Many empirical developments already \nunder discussion can be framed in this way: the division of sovereignty in the \nEU\u2019s principle of subsidiarity; the rights given to firms in the state-sanctioned \nmove to build a global market economy; the collective pursuit of big science in \nastronomy, space exploration and high energy physics; the emergence of global \ncivil society; and the attempt to embed a standard of human rights in \ninternational society. Would functional differentiation break down \nstratificatory, or transform and reinforce it by making one sector dominant over \nthe others? From IR, the idea that contemporary international relations could be \nseen as in transition from the dominance of the military-political sector to the \neconomic one was floated by Buzan and Little (2000: 405), and Michael Z\u00fcrn \n(2007) argues that the global system today resembles a legally stratified multi-\nlevel system of governance. At least the early Luhmann seems to be divided on \nthe question, in one place (1982: 238-9) saying that functionally differentiated \nsocieties \u2018cannot be ruled by leading parts or elites as stratified societies (to \nsome extent) could be\u2019, and in another (1982: 338) arguing that the primacy of \npolitics was displaced by that of economics during the 17th and 18th centuries \nwhere \u2018the economy becomes the leading subsystem of society, because it \nbegan to define the developmental stage at which society had arrived, and both \nprogress and regression began to depend on it\u2019. From Anthropology, Johnson \n \n \n \n30 \nand Earle (2000: 367-90), building on the thinking of Polanyi, also argue for \nthe primacy of economics in a functionally stratified world, and similar thinking \nunderpins most Marxist approaches. Again, the taxonomy of differentiation \nprovides powerful tools for thinking about globalization, an area of IR with \nnotoriously weak theoretical foundations. \n Functional differentiation thus opens a way of thinking that enables many \ndifferent strands of IR theory to be linked together in a framing that puts all of \nthem into a single structural context. This potentially integrative solution to the \nproblems of a (theoretically) divided discipline can be shown by indicating how \nmost of the main theoretical approaches within IR can be related to the \ndifferentiation taxonomy: \n\u2022 Realism gives primacy to segmentary differentiation in its general approach, \nand to stratificatory differentiation in its emphasis on great powers. \n\u2022 Liberalism gives primacy to functional differentiation, starting from that \nbetween the political and economic sectors, but also acknowledges \nsegmentary (anarchic structure) and stratificatory (hegemonic stability). \n\u2022 Marxism combines functional differentiation (the primacy of economics) \nwith stratification (whether in terms of dominant classes, or a more general \ncentre-periphery structure of the international system). \n\u2022 English school pluralists, like Realists, give primacy to segmentary \ndifferentiation in their general approach, and to stratificatory differentiation \nin their emphasis on great powers and the forceful expansion of international \nsociety. Solidarists are more open to adding functional differentiation into \nthis mix. \n\u2022 Constructivism does not employ assumptions about differentiation, but \ndifferentiation suggests an interesting starting point for thinking about the \nidentities that are of central interest to constructivists. National identity \n \n \n \n31 \nreflects segmentary differentiation; class, caste, hypernationalist and \nimperial-metropolitan identities reflect stratificatory differentiations; and \nlayered postmodern identities reflect functional differentiation. \n\u2022 Globalization follows liberalism in giving primacy to functional \ndifferentiation, starting from that between the political and economic sectors \nand adding global civil society. Segmentary and stratificatory differentiation \nare acknowledged in varying degrees, with the former mainly on the way \nout, and the latter, as in Marxism, shifting from arrangements within the \npolitical sector to a functional primacy of the economic one. \nViewed in this way, the main strands of IR theory can be seen as reflecting \ndifferent choices about what to emphasise within a single general scheme of \ndifferentiation. In principle, the systematic application of differentiation theory \nto empirical assessments of the current state of development of the international \nsystem\/society should provide a common basis for judging the relevance claims \nof the different theories. Adoption of a shared differentiation taxonomy could \nalso relieve IR of the burden of thinking of itself as composed of \nincommensurable paradigms. Different approaches, certainly, but unrelated and \nmutually exclusive, certainly not. And at least in Durkheim\u2019s model, there is \neven room for both materialist and constructivist approaches to social structure, \nthough his scheme gives primacy to the former. \n Bringing differentiation into IR opens a realm largely unexplored by \nsociologists, and so offers IR the possibility to bring its own expertise, \nparticularly on levels of analysis, to the development of the theory itself. \nNobody has really thought about how differentiation works where first- and \nsecond-order societies are both in play. It could be argued that IR is principally \nabout the study of second-order societies, which makes this obvious territory \nfor it to occupy.  \n \n \n \n32 \n Keeping in mind all that has just been said about how to apply the \ntaxonomy of differentiation to the layered subject matter of IR, we turn now to \nthink about how the sense of history and the forces that allegedly drive the \nevolution of differentiation might be used to rethink how IR understands the \nhistory of international systems\/societies. Recall that differentiation assumes \ngeneral, but not inevitable, evolution up the sequence from segmentary to \nfunctional. It therefore offers both a social structural framework by which \nhistory can be benchmarked, and a set of expectations (not determinations) \nabout the direction in which things should go provided that the dynamic density \ngenerated by population and technology is increasing. Because it is mainly a \nforward-looking subject, IR often treats history (other than its own) as a \nCinderella subject, contenting itself with either event-driven narrative accounts \nof recent history, or selective raids looking for past cases to support or attack \ncurrent theoretical positions. Many Realists find history dull because they see it \nmainly as repetition, and many liberals find it irrelevant because most of what \nthey want to talk about happened quite recently. Serious commitment to \ndeveloping a long historical view of international relations is mainly found in \nthe English school (Bull and Watson, 1984; Watson, 1992; Buzan and Little, \n2000) and World Systems theory (Wallerstein, 1974, 1984; Gills and Frank, \n1993).6 Because it offers a potential theory of international history, \ndifferentiation could provide a more general stimulus to IR to develop a \ncoherent view of history that links across its main theoretical approaches.  \n Some of the likely benchmarks in such a view might be as follows: \n\u2022 Because differentation sets up a link between IR and Anthropology it might \nfacilitate a move away from IR\u2019s current practice of thinking about the \norigins of international relations mainly through the imaginings of European \npolitical theorists such as Hobbes, Kant and Rousseau, to thinking about \n \n \n \n33 \nwhat actually occurred in prehistory (Buzan and Little, 2000: 111-162). At \nwhat point did the early stages of differentiation generate units capable of \nhaving recognizable \u2018international relations\u2019, and how were those relations \naffected as the domestic structure of the units moved up from segmentary to \nstratified? \n\u2022 The ancient and classical worlds offer a model of international relations in \nwhich stratificatory differentiation dominated both within the units (kings, \nemperors, slaves) and at the system level (unequal status, empire), across \nseveral millennia and several distinct international systems. This includes \neven the much-raided IR case of the ancient Greek city states, which, despite \ntheir standing as the archetype of anarchic (segmentary) international \nrelations, were embedded in a larger system\/society including the Persian \nEmpire. Within this dominance of stratification one also finds elements of \nfunctional differentiation in the existence of well-institutionalised trade \ndiasporas. Because stratificatory differentiation involves unequal access to \nbasic resources it requires coercion to sustain it and this suggests that \nstratified units will both concentrate coercive power internally and resort to \nwar externally (Fried, 1967:185-230). \n\u2022 In the perspective of differentiation, the Medieval period (largely a \nEuropean phenomenon) was both stratified (popes, emperors, the nobility), \nand up to a point functionally differentiated (churches, guilds), yet without \nthere being a single authority overall. The Medieval story is important in IR \nbecause it is the precursor to the Westphalian order that arose in Europe and \nwas imposed from there onto the rest of the world (Ruggie, 1983). \n\u2022 These characterisations of the ancient and classical, and Medieval worlds \nraise major questions for how differentiation works when it is in play on \nboth the domestic and international system\/society levels. A two-level game \n \n \n \n34 \nis bound to have quite different dynamics from the single-level model of \nDurkheim. When two levels are in play, it is far from obvious that the \nsingle-level model of progress up the ladder from segmentary to \nstratificatory to functional differentiation, driven by increasing dynamic \ndensity, will apply. In post-Medieval Europe, for example, the leading units \nmoved internally from stratificatory (absolutism) to functional (modernity) \ndifferentiation, while the European system became more segmentary \n(sovereign equality). This system\/society expanded out into the rest of the \nworld in which both units and systems were still largely in stratification \nmode on both levels. European imperialism perpetuated systemic \nstratification in the rest of the world on both levels, while Europe and the \nWest became more functionally differentiated domestically, with a \nsegmentary international subsystem of their own. Decolonization extended \nsegmentary differentiation (sovereign equality) globally at the system level, \nalbeit leaving much domestic stratification domestically in the third world, \nand not inconsiderable elements of stratification remaining at the system \nlevel (the P5 in the UN Security Council, the core-periphery structure of the \nglobal economy, the hegemony of the West). These patterns suggest that the \noperation of differentiation is considerably more complicated when two \nlevels are in play. If IR takes up differentiation, it will have to think through \nthese implications, and may find some possibly major opportunities for \ntheoretical development within both IR and social theory more widely. \n\u2022 The last benchmark is the apparent move from a mainly \nsegmentary\/stratificatory Westphalian international system to one in which \nfunctional differentiation is emergent at the global level. As discussed \nabove, a key question here is how this development at the system level \nrelates to what is going on within states. On the face of it, a case could be \n \n \n \n35 \nmade that the push for functional differentiation systemically comes from \nthose states where it is most advanced internally, with this in turn creating \nproblems for those states whose internal differentiation is less advanced. \n These benchmarks show how differentation offers a powerful organizing \nprinciple for studying the history of international systems in a way that links \ntogether the concerns of many different approaches to IR. They also raise \nquestions about how the historical development of international systems relates \nto the driving forces side of differentiation theory. IR is not without its own \nideas about driving forces though for the most part these remain in the \nbackground of its debates. Realists stress war (Gilpin, 1981; Howard, 1976; see \nalso Tilly, 1990) and more generally changes in the distribution of power. \nLiberals and globalizationists look to changes in the economy and especially \nthe rise of interdependence as a structural feature and more autonomous non-\nstate actors as a unit one. Marxists also start from the economy, but look to \nclass conflict, which might be seen as an aspect of stratification. Luhmann \n(1982: 45-51) sees the rise of mass communication, along with functional \ndifferentiation, as the basis of a single world society. All of these approaches \nare aware of technological advance as a general driver, but all are also \nEurocentric. Although a thousand years of war might have produced the \nWestphalian state in Europe (Tilly, 1990), it did not do so anywhere else in the \nworld. There is a need within IR to think more deeply, and over a longer \nhistorical stretch, not only about how to benchmark systemic change but also \nabout the forces that drive it. The ideas from Sociology and Anthropology \ndiscussed above about the interplay of population growth and technological \ninnovation within environmental constraints as the \u2018primary engine\u2019 for the \nevolution of social forms, look like a good place to start such thinking. The \ninterplay of Durkheim\u2019s dynamic density with the environmental constraints \n \n \n \n36 \nfeatured by Anthropologists applies as much to the system level as to the \ndomestic one. But although the logic of this \u2018engine\u2019 is broadly the same at both \nlevels, its impact might well differ because of differences in scale. Other things \nbeing equal, the increase of dynamic density should push the process of \ndifferentiation within states faster (because they are small) than at the system \nlevel (because of the constraints of distance). Yet even here there can be crucial \nexceptions. The central role of ocean-going shipping in world history created a \nsignificant increase in systemic dynamic density when the units themselves \nwere still a long way from being internally integrated. These ideas about \ndriving forces are clearly applicable to the early development of international \nrelations, and just as clearly applicable to the present, where the environmental \nconstraint is now global, and the pressure from population and technology \nimmense. However it is labelled, IR needs to pull together its thinking about \nwhat drives the evolution of international systems\/societies, and relate its \nexisting ideas to the more basic ones attached to differentiation.  \n \nConclusions \n \n In this article we have extracted a set of ideas about differentiation derived \nfrom Sociology and Anthropology. We have shown why this set of ideas has so \nfar not been given much consideration within IR, and how and why the one \nencounter between IR and Sociology that might have changed this failed to do \nso. We have set out in some detail how differentiation bears on the subject \nmatter of IR, how it adds a radical third dimension to IR debates about \nstructure, and how it offers a general framing within which much of IR theory \ncan be located, and possibly integrated. We have argued that this set of ideas \noffers new ways of looking at the subject matter of IR, and new insights into it. \n \n \n \n37 \nOur aims have been to set out a general rationale for bringing differentiation \ninto IR theory debates, and to show some of the main things that might be done \nwith it. We think that differentiation offers to IR a major possibility for \ntheoretical development. What is handed on from Anthropology and Sociology \nis mainly designed for smaller, less layered subject matters than that of IR. In \nadapting differentiation to its larger scale, more layered subject matter, IR can \ndevelop it into something new and more powerful for social theory as a whole. \nThis is an opportunity not only for IR to strengthen its own theoretical \napparatus, but also to make much more of a splash among other social sciences \nthan it has done so far. \n \n___________________________________________________ \nNotes \n1. There is an ambiguity in Luhmann (and quite a debate) on whether \u2018centre-periphery\u2019 is a form of differentiation \non the same scale as segmentary, stratificatory, and functional differentiation. We do not have the space to engage \nwith this discussion here, but want to point out that when Luhmann refers to this form of differentiation under the \ncondition of a primacy of functional differentiation, he does not mean it in a geographic sense at all, but refers to the \ncentre and the periphery of function systems (so that, for example, a court decision would certainly belong to the \ncentre of the legal system, whereas the legal relation underlying the purchase of a pint in a local pub would be more \non the periphery). \n2. For an extensive discussion see Donnelly (2009). It should be noted here as well that Immanuel Wallerstein \nfrequently describes the modern world-system explicitly in terms of stratification (although he does reject the \nnotions of \u2018First\u2019 and \u2018Third\u2019 World). \n3. The legitimacy (and thus also the stability) seems to be directly related to the degree to which a stratified order is \ndifferentiated into various strata. As Luhmann (1997: 613; translation BB\/MA) notes: \u2018This form [stratification; \nBB\/MA] also has its basic structure in a binary distinction, namely that between nobility and the common people. In \nthis form it would however be relatively unstable as it could be reversed easily. Stable hierarchies such as the Indian \ncaste system or the late-medieval society of estates thus produce, in whatever artificial way, at least three different \nlevels in order to create the impression of stability\u2019. \n4. This is not to deny that in addition to viewing the political sector as functionally differentiated from other sectors \none could argue that it is also functionally differentiated internally; see Albert (2002) for a book-length elaboration \non this issue. \n5. Donnelly (2009) also seeks to break away from anarchy-hierarchy, and his exceedingly complicated scheme does \nin places move beyond the political sector. \n6.
