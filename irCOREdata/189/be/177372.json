PDB-causing missense and nonsense variants in the gene encoding \nSequestosome-1\/p62 (SQSTM1) have been identified, all of which cluster in and around the \nubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the protein. SQSTM1 is ubiquitously expressed and \nthere is, as yet, no clear reason why these mutations only appear to cause an osteoclast-\nrelated phenotype.   \n   \nUsing co-immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a novel \ninteraction in human osteoclast-like cells between SQSTM1 and Autophagy-Linked FYVE \ndomain-containing protein (ALFY\/ WDFY3).  Endogenous ALFY and SQSTM1 both \nlocalised within the nuclei of osteoclasts and their mononuclear precursors.  When osteoclasts \nwere starved to induce autophagy, SQSTM1 and ALFY relocated to the cytoplasm where \nthey formed large aggregates, with cytoplasmic relocalisation appearing more rapid in mature \nosteoclasts than in precursors in the same culture.  Overexpression of wild-type SQSTM1 in \nHEK293 cells also resulted in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates containing SQSTM1 \nand endogenous ALFY, as did overexpression of a PDB-causing missense mutant form of \nSQSTM1, indicating that this mutation does not impair the formation of SQSTM1- and \nALFY-containing aggregates.   \n \nExpression of ALFY in bone cells has not previously been reported, and the process of \nautophagy has not been studied with respect to osteoclast activity.  We have identified a \nfunctional interaction between SQSTM1 and ALFY in osteoclasts under conditions of cell \nstress.  The difference in response to starvation between mature osteoclasts and their \nprecursors may begin to explain the cell-specific functional effects of SQSTM1 mutations in \nPDB.   \nKEYWORDS  \n \nSequestosome-1 \nAutophagy-linked FYVE domain protein \nWD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3 \nPaget\u2019s disease of bone \nOsteoclast \nAutophagy \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nALFY  Autophagy-linked FYVE domain-containing protein \nhOCL  Human osteoclast-like cells \nPDB  Paget\u2019s disease of bone \nSQSTM1 Sequestosome-1 \nWDFY3 WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3 \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nInherited mutations in the gene encoding Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) \nhave been described among individuals affected with late-onset Paget\u2019s disease of bone \n(PDB) (reviewed in [1]).  PDB is a common metabolic bone disorder that affects around 3% \nCaucasians, typically diagnosed in the fifth or sixth decade, and is characterised by focal \nlesions of increased bone turnover [2].  Within these lesions, bone-resorbing osteoclasts are \nincreased in size, number, multinuclearity and activity.  Bone-forming osteoblasts are \nsubsequently over-activated, and the bone deposited is disorganised, weak and prone to \nfracture. \n \nSQSTM1 is ubiquitously expressed and functions as a scaffold protein to integrate and \ndiversify signals from multiple receptors, including tumour necrosis factor receptor family \nmembers, interleukin receptors, and nerve growth factor receptors (reviewed in [3]).  A role \nfor SQSTM1 in sequestration of protein aggregates prior to their degradation by autophagy \nhas also been described [4].  Various PDB-causing mutations in SQSTM1 have been \nidentified, all of which cluster in and around the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) \ndomain.  The most common mutation identified thus far results in heterozygous substitution \nof a proline residue at codon 392 with a leucine (P392L), and is found in around one-quarter \nof PDB cases examined [5]. \n \nPDB is caused by germline mutations, yet disease onset and severity are regulated both \ntemporally (usually late-onset) and spatially (causing specific lesions within the skeleton).  It \nhas been proposed that these may be regulated by environmental factors such as viral \ninfection (reviewed in [6]), although this remains controversial [7].  The aim of this study \ntherefore was to identify proteins within osteoclasts that interact with SQSTM1 and that may \naccount for the apparent cell-specific effects of PDB-causing mutations in SQSTM1.   \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nCell Culture \nWith approval from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (UK), human \nosteoclast-like (hOCL) cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells donated \nby health volunteers, as described previously [8].  Briefly, venous blood samples were \ncollected into EDTA-coated Vacutainer tubes by venepuncture, and mononuclear cells \nisolated by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd, \nUK) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Cells were resuspended in \u03b1MEM (Sigma-\nAldrich) containing 10% foetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100U\/ml penicillin, 0.1mg\/ml \nstreptomycin and 20ng\/ml recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor \n(rhMCSF; R&D Systems) at 1x106 cells\/ml, seeded into 75cm2 flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C, \n5% CO2 until cells reached ~80% confluence. \n \nFor co-immunoprecipitation analysis, culture medium in 75cm2 flasks was additionally \nsupplemented with 100ng\/ml recombinant human receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand \n(rhRANKL; Peprotech) and the culture continued until multinucleated osteoclast-like cells \nhad formed.  For immunohistochemical analysis, the M-CSF-dependent mononuclear cells in \n75cm2 flasks were trypsinised and seeded onto serum-coated glass coverslips in 48-well \nplates at 40,000 cells per well in medium containing 20ng\/ml rhMCSF and 100ng\/ml \nrhRANKL, and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.  Once cells had fused to form multinucleated \nhOCLs, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. \n \nHuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell lines were obtained from the European Collection \nof Cell Cultures and maintained in \u03b1MEM containing 10% foetal calf serum, 2mM L-\nglutamine, 100U\/ml penicillin and 0.1mg\/ml streptomycin.  For immunohistochemical \nanalysis, cells in 75cm2 flasks were trypsinised and seeded onto serum-coated glass \ncoverslips in 48-well plates at 40,000 cells per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 until they \nreached ~80% confluence. \n \nImmunoprecipitation \nLysates were prepared from hOCLs in 75cm2 flasks when the majority of cells had fused to \nform large, multinucleated cells.  Cells were scraped on ice into cold lysis buffer consisting \nof 25mM HEPES pH7.5, 150mM sodium chloride, 1% v\/v Triton, 25mM sodium fluoride, \n1mM EDTA, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% v\/v mammalian protein inhibitor cocktail \n(Sigma) and 0.4% v\/v phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).  The lysate was incubated with \nProtein-G Agarose beads (Calbiochem) to remove proteins that bound non-specifically to the \nbeads.  The cleared lysate was then incubated for one hour with guinea-pig N-terminal \nspecific anti-SQSTM1 antibody (GP62N, Progen) and for a further hour with Protein-G \nAgarose beads.  The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer then the bound proteins \nwere eluted from the beads by incubation at 95\u00b0C for five minutes in reducing sample buffer.      \n \nProtein Identification \nEluted proteins, as well as proteins that bound non-specifically to Protein-G Agarose beads, \nunbound proteins (first wash) and total lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% Bis-Tris \nHCl gel (Biorad) and visualised using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce).  Bands that \nappeared specifically among the eluted proteins and not in the non-specific binding or wash \nfractions were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion.  Briefly, \nproteins were reduced with DTT (60\u00b0C, 20 min), S-alkylated with iodoacetamide (25\u00b0C, 10 \nmin) then digested with trypsin (37\u00b0C, 8 h). The resulting tryptic peptide extract was dried by \nrotary evaporation (SC110 Speedvac; Savant Instruments, USA) and dissolved in 0.1% \nformic acid for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.  \n \nPeptide solutions were analysed using an HCTultra PTM Discovery System (Bruker \nDaltonics Ltd, UK) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 LC System (Dionex (UK) Ltd, UK). \nPeptides were separated on a Monolithic Capillary Column (200 \u00b5m i.d. x 5 cm; Dionex part \nno. 161409).  Eluent A was 3% acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% formic acid; Eluent B \nwas 80% acetonitrile in water containing 0.04% formic acid with a gradient of 3% - 45% \nEluent B in 12 minutes at a flow rate of 2.5\u00b5L\/min. Peptide fragment mass spectra were \nacquired in data-dependent AutoMS(2) mode with a scan range of 300-1500 m\/z, 3 averages, \nand up to 3 precursor ions selected from the MS scan (100-2200 m\/z). Precursors were \nactively excluded within a 1.0 min window, and all singly charged ions were excluded. \n \nPeptide peaks were detected and deconvoluted automatically using data analysis software \n(Bruker). Mass lists in the form of Mascot Generic Files were created automatically and used \nas the input for Mascot MS\/MS Ions searches of the NCBInr database using the Matrix \nScience web server. The default search parameters used were: Enzyme = Trypsin, Max. \nMissed cleavages = 1; Fixed modifications = Carbamidomethyl (C); Variable modifications = \nOxidation (M); Peptide tolerance \u00b1 1.5 Da; MS\/MS tolerance \u00b1 0.5 Da; Peptide charge = 2+ \nand 3+; Instrument = ESI-TRAP.  Any protein with an overall score above zero is listed; \nscores are a composite from individual peptide scores and are used to rank hits.  Data from \nthis study are deposited in PRIDE [9], accession number 13762, and were converted from \nMascot Generic File format using PRIDE Converter [10] version 2.4.2. \n \nGeneration and transfection of FLAG-tagged SQSTM1 Plasmids \nPlasmids containing wild-type or 392L SQSTM1 in pGEX4-T1 were kindly donated by Dr \nRob Layfield, University of Nottingham and have been described previously [11].  N-\nterminal FLAG-tagged SQSTM1 variants were prepared by excising full-length SQSTM1 \nfrom pGEX4-T1 vectors using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites then subcloning the insert \ninto pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene).  Plasmids containing FLAG-tagged SQSTM1 were \ntransformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent Cells (Stratagene), grown overnight in 100ml \nLB-broth containing 50\u00b5g\/ml kanamycin, and purified using Endotoxin-free Plasmid \nMidiprep kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Inserts in plasmids were \nsequenced at the University of Dundee Sequencing Service using gene-specific primers (N-\nterminus: 5\u2019- ACCAAGTCCCCGTCCTCATCGC-3\u2019 and C-terminus: 5\u2019- \nCCCGTCTACAGGTGAACTCCAG-3\u2019) to ensure correct orientation and confirm presence \nof the expected SQSTM1 mutation.   \nHEK293 cells on glass coverslips were transfected with FLAG-SQSTM1 when they reached \n~80% confluence.  Cells were transfected with 250ng plasmid DNA (wild-type or P392L) \nusing 3:1 FuGENE6 (Roche): plasmid.  Following transfection, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, \n5% CO2 for 24 hours, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.   \n \nImmunofluorescence Detection of SQSTM1 and ALFY   \nFixed hOCLs or HEK293 cells on glass coverslips were permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-\n100 and blocked with 10% FCS in PBS.  Endogenous SQSTM1 was detected using 1:100 \nguinea-pig anti-p62, N-terminal-specific (Progen) in 5% FCS followed by 1:100 AlexaFluor\u00ae \n594 goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Molecular Probes) in 5% FCS.  Endogenous ALFY was \ndetected with 1:100 rabbit anti-ALFY [12] in 5% FCS and 1:150 AlexaFluor\u00ae 488 goat anti-\nrabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) in 5% FCS.  FLAG-tagged SQSTM1 was detected using 1:200 \nmouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) in 5% FCS followed by 1:150 AlexaFluor\u00ae 488 goat anti-mouse \nIgG (Molecular Probes) in 5% FCS.  Nuclei were counterstained using TO-PRO\u00ae-3 iodide \n(Molecular Probes).  Subcellular localisation was visualised by laser scanning confocal \nmicroscopy (LSM510 Meta, Zeiss).  Images were captured using multi-track image capture \nfor far red (633nm), red (543nm), and green (488nm) channels using the same acquisition \nparameters for all images.  No image processing was performed.      \n \nCell Starvation \nhOCLs were starved of serum, growth factors and amino acids for various durations by \nculturing cells in Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) as described previously [12].  \nBriefly, medium was removed and cells were washed three times with HBSS pre-warmed to \n37\u00b0C before incubation in HBSS at 37\u00b0C for the specified duration.  Following starvation, \ncells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical detection of SQSTM1 \nand ALFY as described above.   \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nSQSTM1 functionally interacts with ALFY \nImmunoprecipitation of p62 from human osteoclast lysates produced five bands of co-\nprecipitated proteins that appeared to be bound specifically to p62 and which were not \napparent in the non-specific binding fraction or in the unbound (first wash) fraction (Figure \n1); these ranged in mass from ~30kDa to ~180kDa.  Each of the five bands was excised and \nanalysed separately to identify proteins present.  For all bands, immunoglobulin heavy and \nlight chains were identified, with protein scores ranging from 29-99.  Bands 1 & 2 also \ncontained Autophagy-linked FYVE domain protein (ALFY, also known as WD40- and \nFYVE-domain containing protein 3, WDFY3).  The overall protein score for ALFY was 31 \nfor both bands; protein coverage was 2%, and the predicted peptide fragments were unique to \nALFY.  No other proteins were identified for bands 1-5 with overall scores above zero. \n \nALFY is localised to the nuclei of human osteoclasts and their precursors  \nWe used immunofluorescence staining to examine whether endogenous ALFY was present in \nhOCLs and whether it colocalised with endogenous SQSTM1 (Figure 2). ALFY was \ndetectable as weak staining throughout the nuclei of multinucleated hOCL and in \nmononuclear precursors, with intense perinuclear staining. Staining of SQSTM1 was weak \nand diffuse in the cytoplasm of mature hOCLs and precursors, with more intense staining \nthroughout the nuclei.  Colocalisation of SQSTM1 and ALFY was not apparent under normal \nculture conditions. \n \nSQSTM1 and ALFY relocalise into cytoplasmic aggregates upon starvation  \nhOCL cultures were starved for 0-120 minutes in HBSS and immunostained for endogenous \nALFY and SQSTM1 (Figure 3).  In unstarved cells, SQSTM1 and ALFY localised \npredominantly to the nucleus and perinuclear region in both mononuclear and multinucleated \ncells, as described above (Figure 2).  After 60 minutes of starvation, the abundance of nuclear \nSQSTM1 and ALFY appeared to increase, particularly in multinucleated osteoclasts.  By 90 \nminutes of starvation, SQSTM1 and ALFY staining was evident in the cytoplasm as well as \nthe nucleus of osteoclasts, but was still present only in the nuclei of mononuclear precursor \ncells.   After 120 minutes of starvation, ALFY and SQSTM1 colocalised in cytoplasmic \naggregates in osteoclasts but not precursor cells; at this time, cytoplasmic ALFY staining was \nfirst evident in mononuclear precursor cells.  Multinucleated cells thus appeared to respond \nmore rapidly than mononuclear cells in the same culture to amino acid starvation, in terms of \nALFY relocalisation to the cytoplasm (90\u2019 for hOCL versus 120\u2019 for precursors) and \naggregate formation (present at 120\u2019 in hOCL but not precursors). \n \nSQSTM1 and ALFY colocalisation in cytoplasmic aggregates is not affected by the PDB-\ncausing P392L mutation in SQSTM1  \nWild-type (392P) and Pagetic mutant (392L) SQSTM1 were transiently overexpressed in \nHEK293 cells.  In untransfected cells, endogenous ALFY displayed typical perinuclear \nlocalisation.  In cells transfected with wild-type FLAG-SQSTM1, endogenous ALFY was \ndetected in the cytoplasm, where it colocalised with FLAG-SQSTM1 in cytoplasmic \naggregates.  This colocalisation occurred in the absence of cell starvation.  Similarly, in cells \ntransfected with 392L-FLAG-SQSTM1, SQSTM1 colocalised with endogenous ALFY in \ncytoplasmic aggregates (Figure 4). \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nALFY is a recently-described evolutionarily conserved protein involved in autophagic \ndegradation of aggregated proteins [12].  We have shown for the first time that this protein is \nexpressed in human osteoclasts and their precursors.  In these cells, ALFY translocates \nrapidly from a perinuclear localisation to form cytoplasmic aggregates with SQSTM1 upon \namino acid starvation.  Similar localisation of ALFY has been reported previously in HeLa \ncells [12].   \n \nA sequence comparison of the proteins in human osteoclasts that precipitated with SQSTM1 \nidentified peptides matching ALFY in two separate molecular mass bands between ~100-\n180kDa.  An antibody specific to residues 2969-2984 and 3302-3316 in the full-length ALFY \nprotein was reported previously to detect two bands of ~400kDa and ~150kDa kDa by \nWestern blot analysis of HeLa cells [12], and three transcript variants for ALFY are reported \nin Entrez Gene [13] with predicted molecular masses of 395kDa, 90kDa and 32kDa.  It \ntherefore remains to be investigated which isoforms of ALFY are present and functional in \nosteoclasts.   \n \nWe initially identified an interaction in osteoclasts between ALFY and SQSTM1 by \ncoimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates.  However, by immunofluorescence staining, these \nproteins only appeared to colocalise in the cytoplasm under conditions of cell stress \n(starvation) and did not colocalise in the nuclei of osteoclasts under normal culture \nconditions.  It is therefore possible that we identified this interaction between ALFY and \nSQSTM1 by inducing the stress response during the process of preparing the cultures for \nlysis and immunoprecipitation.   \n In this study, we showed that overexpression of wild-type SQSTM1 in HEK293 cells results \nin the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of SQSTM1 that colocalise with ALFY, similar to \nthe aggregate formation observed in hOCL upon amino acid starvation. Further, we showed \nthat this aggregate formation and colocalisation was not impaired by the PDB-causing \nSQSTM1 UBA domain 392L mutation.  Overexpression of wild-type and mutated forms of \nSQSTM1 (including 392L) in HEK293 cells has been reported previously to result in the \nformation of SQSTM1-containing cytoplasmic aggregates, with mutated SQSTM1 forming \nlarger aggregates than wild-type SQSTM1 [14].  We did not observe larger aggregate \nformation in cells expressing 392L-SQSTM1 compared to wild-type, although this could be \nbecause we used smaller amounts of plasmid DNA and examined cells at 24 hours after \ntransfection rather than after 48 hours as per the previous study.   \n \nDuring preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that SQSTM1 and ALFY interact to \norganise misfolded, ubiquitinated proteins into aggregates that become degraded by \nautophagy [15], with SQSTM1 responsible for shuttling of ALFY from the nucleus into the \ncytoplasm.  Interestingly, deletion of the entire UBA domain of SQSTM1 retained the \nnucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of ALFY but prevented formation of SQSTM- and ALFY-\ncontaining aggregates [15], suggesting that an intact UBA domain of SQSTM1 is required for \nrecruitment of ALFY to cytoplasmic aggregates.  We have now shown that this recruitment is \nnot impaired by the presence of the PDB-causing 392L mutation in the UBA domain of \nSQSTM1.  The interaction between SQSTM1 and ALFY has since also been shown to be \nimportant for the selective autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins rather than for bulk \nautophagic degradation in response to cell stress [16].  It is likely that the mutated SQSTM1 \nfound in PDB accumulates in aggregates as the misfolded target of selective degradation as \nwell as being a facilitator of the degradation process itself, and the effect of mutated \nSQSTM1 on selective autophagic degradation requires further investigation.  The mechanism \nby which this would lead to the phenotype in patients of over-activated osteoclasts (with \nother cells apparently unaffected) is not yet clear.  The more rapid induction of (presumably \nautophagic) aggregate formation in response to cell stress in mature osteoclasts than their \nprecursors observed in this study suggests that osteoclasts may have a greater dependence \nupon autophagy to maintain cellular function.  Indeed, preliminary reports suggest that \nautophagy proteins regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts [17].  Together these point to a \nrole for the process of selective autophagy in regulating osteoclast formation and function \nthat warrants further investigation, and suggest a potential mechanism by which PDB-causing \nmutations in SQSTM1 exert osteoclast-specific effects. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors wish to express their thanks to the following people: Mrs Denise Tosh for \nsupport with cell culture; Mrs Elizabeth Stewart (Aberdeen Proteomics Facility) for running \nsamples through LC-MS\/MS; Mr Kevin Mackenzie (Microscopy and Imaging Facility, \nUniversity of Aberdeen) for assistance with confocal imaging; and Mrs Angela Duthie for \ntechnical support for cloning.

Merged image shows ALFY and SQSTM1 only.  Mature, \nmultinucleated osteoclasts (circled) and mononuclear precursors are present in the same \nculture.  In all cells, ALFY is present in the nuclei only whereas SQSTM1 is both nuclear and \ncytoplasmic.  No colocalisation between SQSTM1 and ALFY was apparent.   \n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Relocalisation of SQSTM1 and ALFY in osteoclasts and precursors upon \namino acid starvation \nConfocal images from hOCL cultures are shown, stained for endogenous SQSTM1 (red), \nALFY (green) and nuclei (blue) for unstarved cells (0\u2019) and cells starved in HBSS for 60, 90 \nand 120 minutes.  Merged images show ALFY and SQSTM1 only.  All images were taken \nusing same acquisition settings.  By 90\u2019, ALFY and SQSTM1 colocalise in the cytoplasm of \na multinucleated hOCL (black arrow), but not in mononuclear precursors in the same culture.  \nAfter 120\u2019, ALFY has started to relocate to the cytoplasm of mononuclear precursors (black \narrow) while, in mature hOCLs, cytoplasmic aggregates have formed.  The magnified image \nof the osteoclast at 120\u2019 is taken from a slightly different optical slice through the cell, and \nillustrates the colocalisation of ALFY and SQSTM1 in cytoplasmic aggregates (white \narrows). \n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Colocalisation of overexpressed SQSTM1 with endogenous ALFY in \nHEK293 cells is not affected by SQSTM1 P392L mutation \nConfocal images of HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type (392P) or Pagetic \nmutant (392L) SQSTM1, and untransfected cells.
