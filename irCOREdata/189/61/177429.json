To measure diet of undergraduate students, a new online 121-item Food Recall\nChecklist (FoRC) was designed as an alternative to a non-weighed record (food diary). This article\nreports the comparison between the new dietary assessment method (FoRC) and the food diary\nas a measure of energy (kJ), fat (g), Non-Starch Polysaccharide (NSP) (g), fruit and vegetables (g),\nbreakfast cereal (g) and bread (g) and alcohol (units) intake.\nMethods: Fifty-three students at the University of Aberdeen completed four days of FoRC then\nfour days food diary. Median agreement and correlation between the two methods was assessed\nfor foods and nutrients using the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient and the Wilcoxon signed\nranks test. Agreement between FoRC and food diary was assessed using the Bland-Altman method.\nResults: The mean time taken to complete FoRC for one day was 7.4 minutes. Intakes of fat (g\nand % food energy), NSP and bread were similar between FoRC and the food diary. Median energy\nintake was 8185 kJ in the food diary and 8007 kJ in FoRC. However, FoRC recorded significantly\nlower intakes of energy and alcohol and significantly higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and\nbreakfast cereal compared with the food diary. There was considerable variation in agreement\nbetween methods at the individual level. For all variables except alcohol and percentage energy\nfrom fat, correlation co-efficients were statistically significant and greater than 0.5.\nConclusion: At the group level, four days of FoRC showed good median agreement with the food\ndiary and there was high correlation between methods for most foods and nutrients. This suggests\nthat this novel method of assessing diet can provide a useful alternative for assessing group mean\nintakes but that individual intakes may need to be interpreted with care.\nBackground\nUniversity students are commonly overlooked when diet\nof populations is measured and there is a lack of compre-\nhensive dietary assessment in university student popula-\ntions. These individuals are less likely to be included in\nfamily, workplace or community-based diet and health\ninterventions. The transition to catering for oneself can be\na period of changing dietary habits [1].

Since a student\npopulation may not prioritise eating healthily above\nother social and academic commitments [5], providing\ndiet feedback and advice may be useful.\nIn studies of diet, typical assessment methods are Food\nFrequency Questionnaires (FFQ) or weighed food\nrecords. While these measures have been shown to pro-\nvide valid estimates of diet, both have limitations in terms\nof acceptability to participants and time taken to interpret\nthe data. Ideally, a new dietary assessment method for use\nin a university population would provide a good estimate\nof habitual diet intake, would be acceptable to partici-\npants and would have low costs in terms of money and\ntime. There is evidence of a lower response rate in health\nand diet surveys amongst young adults, especially males\n[6,7], so any new method should appeal to these respond-\nents.\nMeasuring diet in the hard-to-reach university population\nis an issue which can be bridged using newer technologies\nin dietary assessment. There are a number of new ways to\nmeasure diet and to access health information, including\nmobile phones, digital cameras and palmtop computers,\nas well as other computer-based methods [8-12]. In Great\nBritain, 90% of individuals aged 16\u201324 years will have\naccessed the Internet in the previous three months [13]\nand it is now commonplace for institutions such as uni-\nversities to conduct much of their administration via the\nInternet. This growth in Internet access has made collect-\ning dietary data online much easier. Data collected in this\nfashion can be entered remotely and electronically by par-\nticipants and returned pre-coded for analysis.\nTo collect retrospective dietary data from undergraduate\nstudents, a new, online 121-item, 24-h Food Recall\nChecklist (FoRC) was developed. FoRC was designed to\nestimate intake of energy (kJ), fat (g), non-starch polysac-\ncharide (NSP) (g), fruit and vegetables (g), breakfast\ncereal (g) and bread (g) and alcohol (units) on the previ-\nous day. These nutrients and foods were chosen from the\nUK Dietary Reference Values [14] and Scottish Dietary\nTargets [15] as important targets to monitor for public\nhealth. Pilot work on FoRC in another sample of students\n(data not presented) had shown that participants found\nthe instructions easy to understand and that most partici-\npants could easily locate the foods they had consumed\nwithin the questionnaire.\nThe aim of the comparison study was to assess whether\nfour days of FoRC could be used to give an estimate of diet\nintake in place of four days of a more traditional method\nof dietary assessment. This article reports the comparison\nbetween the new dietary assessment method (FoRC) and\nthe non-weighed record as a measure of energy (kJ), fat\n(g), Non-Starch Polysaccharide (NSP) (g), fruit and vege-\ntables (g), breakfast cereal (g) and bread (g) and alcohol\n(units) intake. The non-weighed diet record was chosen as\nit was easier to complete than a weighed record and it was\nnot subject to the same errors of recall as FoRC. The non-\nweighed diet record has been previously used as a dietary\nassessment method in other studies [16,17].\nMethods\nSubjects\nFrom a previous health survey, researchers at the Univer-\nsity of Aberdeen held a list of undergraduate students who\nhad expressed interest in participating in future health sur-\nveys. This list was used to invite students via e-mail to take\npart in this study. This was supported by other methods\nincluding electronic noticeboard messages. Students were\nentered into a prize draw for shopping vouchers and were\nmailed a booklet of tailored diet feedback if they com-\npleted the study. Forty-one female and twelve male under-\ngraduate participants completed four days of FoRC as well\nas four days food diary. Demographic data was collected\nfor 52 participants. Students were living in university\nhalls, in private accommodation or in the family home.\nConsent was presumed if participants approached the\nresearcher to take part in the study after receiving the invi-\ntation.\nConfidentiality\nNo IRB approval was sought for this validation study.\nThere were no confidentiality issues present in the study;\nparticipants were advised with the following statement:\n\"All the information you provide is confidential\". Per-\nsonal information such as names and addresses were not\nreleased to anyone other than the first author, though\nthese were kept for the purpose of individual feedback.\nPersonal information was removed from the rest of the\ndata and was stored separately where only the first author\nhad access.\nFoRC\nFoRC was developed to collect participants' dietary intake\non the previous day via the Internet. The food list was\ndeveloped with reference to existing dietary assessment\nmethods [18] and more detailed investigations into the\ntypical undergraduate diet. On the first page of FoRC, par-\nticipants recorded the time periods when they consumed\nfood and drink items on the previous day, then they\nselected the broad food and beverage groups consumed,\nchoosing from a 16-item list (Figure 1). The next pagePage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13showed a tailored list of the expanded elements for each\nof the main groups chosen on the previous page, accom-\npanied by colour photographs of the selected foods (Fig-\nure 2). Inclusion of photographs in FoRC was designed to\nassist participants in estimating portion size [19]. The use\nof layers of questioning allowed participants extra time to\nrecall foods and beverages consumed, as well as customiz-\ning the long food list to only the items participants had\nconsumed.\nIn total, there were 121 food and drink items in FoRC,\neach of which included details of foods in the group, as\nwell as a description of the intended portion size for each\nitem. Participants recorded the number of portions of\neach food they consumed in a blank box at the end of the\nline. Pilot work had shown that students were more likely\nto complete four days of FoRC than seven days and that\ncorrelation between FoRC and the reference method was\nnot drastically reduced when fewer days were collected\n(data not shown). Participants were asked to complete\nfour consecutive days of FoRC (three weekdays and one\nweekend day). Instructions for completing the question-\nnaire were included online before participants began the\nquestionnaire, but no further direction was given. Partici-\npants visited FoRC each day and recorded all foods and\ndrinks consumed on the previous day. Participants also\ncompleted a demographic questionnaire and questions\non their attitudes to food and healthy eating.\nOnline questionnaires, including FoRC were designed in\nSnap Survey Software v8 (SnapSurveys, Thornbury, Bris-\ntol, UK). Data collected online was imported into SPSS\nv14 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Average daily nutrient\nintakes were calculated using data from UK food compo-\nsition tables [20]. Each line in FoRC was assigned an aver-\nage value for the nutrients of interest. The average value\nfor each item in FoRC was calculated using values for\ncommonly eaten foods in that category. Each item\nincluded foods which were similar in their content of the\nnutrients of interest. Around a quarter of FoRC entries\nrequired additional coding where participants had\nentered 'other foods'.\nFirst page of Food Recall Checklist (FoRC)igure 1\nFirst page of Food Recall Checklist (FoRC).Page 3 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13Food diary\nFollowing completion of four days of FoRC, participants\ncompleted a four-day non-weighed food diary (three\nweekdays and one weekend day), where foods and drinks\nwere recorded as they were consumed. Pilot work had\nshown that a four-day non-weighed diary was highly cor-\nrelated with a seven-day non-weighed diary for the foods\nand nutrients of interest (Spearman's rank correlation co-\nefficient 0.721\u20130.928, p \u2264 0.01) and that four days was\ncompleted by a greater number of participants.\nEstimated food records have been previously used in com-\nparison studies of dietary assessment methods [16,17].\nThe non-weighed food diary was chosen over the weighed\nfood diary to reduce participant burden in a population\nwho are often difficult to recruit and retain to dietary sur-\nveys. It was not known whether the food diary method\nwould be agreeable to participants. FoRC was not com-\npared to a traditional 24-h dietary recall as it was essential\nthat the comparison method was not subject to the same\nerrors of recall as the new method. A crossover design,\nwhere participants were randomly assigned to complete\neither FoRC or the diary first was not used, as it was more\nimportant that participants had no (recent) experience of\ncompleting any dietary assessment method.\nParticipants were asked to be specific in food descriptions\nin the four-day diary, using colour photographs included\nin the back of the diary as a guide to describe portion sizes\n(the same photographs were used in FoRC and the dia-\nries). If foods were not adequately described, the partici-\npant was contacted for clarification, though this was only\nrequired in two cases. Weights of foods were estimated\nusing known weights of the foods in the photographs. If\nphotographs were not used as a reference by the partici-\npant, a weight was assigned to the item using the UK Food\nPortion Sizes guide [21] which provides information on\ntypical weights and portion sizes of UK foods. Further\ninformation on portion or packet sizes was also\nresearched at product or grocery shopping websites. Foods\nand beverages, along with estimated weights, were entered\ninto WinDiets Research (N), diet analysis program (Uni-\nTailored food list in Food Recall Checklist (FoRC)Figu  2\nTailored food list in Food Recall Checklist (FoRC).Page 4 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13vation Ltd, Aberdeen, UK) for calculation of average daily\nintakes. Each diary took the author up to forty-five min-\nutes to code and to enter the data into WinDiets.\nAnalysis\nMale and female participants were analysed as one group\ndue to the small sample size. Median intake and the 95%\nreference range were calculated for eight variables of inter-\nest: energy (kJ), fat (g), percentage food energy from fat,\nNSP (g), fruit and vegetables (g), breakfast cereal (g) and\nbread (g) and alcohol (units). Distribution of variables of\ninterest was assessed using histograms and the one-sided\nK-S test for normality. Since not all intakes were distrib-\nuted normally, the Spearman's rank correlation co-effi-\ncient was used to assess association between methods. The\nWilcoxon signed ranks test was used to test whether vari-\nables differed significantly between the two measure-\nments. As neither dietary assessment method is known to\nprovide completely accurate data and strong association\nbetween methods does not imply agreement between\nmethods, agreement was assessed using the Bland-Altman\nmethod [22]. Bland and Altman suggested that good cor-\nrelation between methods occurs if points lie in a straight\nline, however points must lie along a line of equality for\ngood agreement between methods. This method does not\nrequire Normal distribution of variables.\nResults\nSample characteristics\n542 students were contacted from the list of individuals\ninterested in other health surveys, but only 34 of these\nindividuals completed the study, a response rate of 6.3%.\nA further 19 students were recruited via the other recruit-\nment methods, but response rate for the whole survey was\nincalculable as all students at the university were poten-\ntially exposed to the study. The population was aged 18\u2013\n49 years and the mean age of the population was 23.2 (SD\n= 5.9) years. 73% of participants were aged 17\u201322 years\nand 92.9% of the sample was undergraduate, which\nimplies the majority of the sample fitted the 'transition'\ngroup description. Where data was available, participant's\nself-reported weight and height were used to calculate\nBMI. BMI of the population ranged from 17\u201349 kg\/m2\nand the mean BMI of the sample was 22.8 (SD = 5.0) kg\/\nm2, which sits in the normal weight range.\nDietary intake data\nTable 1 (see Additional File 1) shows the median and 95%\nreference range for intakes of eight foods and nutrients\nfrom the diary and FoRC. Median energy intakes of 8185\nkJ from the diary and 8007 kJ from FoRC were similar to\nwhat would be expected in a sample population with a\nmean BMI in the normal weight range [23]. According to\nthe Wilcoxon signed ranks test, median energy (kJ) and\nalcohol (units) intakes were significantly lower in FoRC\nthan in the diary. Median fruit and vegetable and break-\nfast cereal intakes were significantly higher in FoRC than\nin the diary. The diary showed a narrower range of meas-\nures than FoRC, except for percentage food energy from\nfat, bread (g) and alcohol intakes. Mean differences\nbetween methods were small, but there were wide limits\nof variation for foods and nutrients. Energy intake varied\nbetween methods by \u00b1 5000 kJ and fat intake could vary\nby \u00b1 60 g for a given individual. According to the mean\ndifferences, FoRC showed higher intakes than the diary\nfor NSP (g), fruit and vegetables (g), bread and breakfast\ncereal (g). Table 1 (see Additional file 1) shows that corre-\nlation was generally high between the two methods. For\nall nutrients except alcohol, correlation co-efficients were\nstatistically significant and were greater than 0.5 for all\nnutrients except percentage food energy from fat (0.33\u2013\n0.76). This implied good agreement between the two\nmethods for energy, fat, NSP, fruit and vegetables, bread\nand breakfast cereal, since correlation of greater than 0.5\nis suggested as acceptable in a validation of a new dietary\nassessment method [24].\nBland-Altman\nFigures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 show the mean agreement and\n95% confidence intervals between the diary and FoRC.\nFigure 3 shows mean energy intake from the diary com-\npared to FoRC. At the absolute limits of variation, esti-\nmated energy intake could vary by up to 7000 kJ. In Figure\n4, mean fat intakes (g) were widely spread and showed\nBland-Altman plot of energy intake (kJ): non-weighed record and FoRCFigure 3\nBland-Altman plot of energy intake (kJ): non-weighed \nrecord and FoRC.Page 5 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13extensive variation. Figures 6, 7, 8, 9 and show Bland-Alt-\nman data for NSP (g), fruit and vegetables (g), bread (g)\nand breakfast cereal (g) intakes. The data were disrupted\nby a few large outliers in the each of the figures, but for the\nrest of the measures, results were concentrated around the\nmean difference line. However, for these nutrients and\nfoods there was a tendency for wider differences between\nmethods as the average intake from FoRC and the diary\nincreased. There was no such pattern in the spread of data\nin Figures 3, 4, 5.

How-\never, for most of the variables, median intakes from the\ntwo methods were extremely close. Perfect agreement\nbetween the two methods would not be expected since\ndiet was only measured for 4 days by both methods, and\nit is likely that within-person variation in food and nutri-\nent intake would have contributed to differences in\nintakes between the two methods\nCorrelation\nCorrelation co-efficients between dietary assessment\nmethods of greater than 0.5 for foods and 0.8 for alcohol\nhave been suggested as acceptable in validation studies of\nFFQs and these have been applied here [24]. Due to lack\nof literature on cut-offs for a comparison study of repeated\nwritten 24-h recalls, FFQ cut-offs were applied here. Cor-\nrelation was greater than 0.5 for all non-alcohol variables,\nexcept percentage food energy from fat, implying good\ncorrelation between the methods. Results for these six var-\niables from FoRC were only as reliable as the original par-\nticipant data entered into FoRC and provided an estimate\nBland-Altman plot of bread intake (g): non-weighed record and FoRCFigure 8\nBland-Altman plot of bread intake (g): non-weighed \nrecord and FoRC.\nBland-Altman plot of breakfast cereal intake (g): non-weighed record and FoRCFigu e 9\nBland-Altman plot of breakfast cereal intake (g): \nnon-weighed record and FoRC.\nBland-Altman plot of alcohol intake (units): non-weighed record and FoRCFigu e 10\nBland-Altman plot of alcohol intake (units): non-\nweighed record and FoRCPage 7 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13of four days diet intake as a proxy for habitual dietary\nintake.\nCorrelation between methods of greater than 0.8 could be\nexpected for alcohol [24], but correlation between meth-\nods in this study was well below this figure (r = 0.4). FoRC\nmay not be particularly useful to capture alcohol intakes\nin this population. A young, undergraduate population\nmay have unpredictable drinking patterns or may have\nhad one 'peak' drinking event which was captured by one\nmethod and not the other and variation may be due to dif-\nferences in behaviour, rather than the strength of one\nmethod over the other. Students may have been less\ninclined to use computers after drinking alcohol and may\nbe unlikely to remember excessive alcohol consumption.\nStudents may have been embarrassed to account for high\nalcohol intakes, which could also explain low median\nalcohol intakes reported in Table 1 (see Additional file 1).\nHighest alcohol intake over the measurement period may\nbe a more useful measure.\nCorrelation co-efficients resulting from this study were\ndeemed to be acceptable when employing cut-offs used in\nother dietary assessment comparison studies. Other die-\ntary assessment comparison studies completed in young\nadult populations showed correlations ranging between\n0.3 and 0.7 when results were reported for the same vari-\nables as this study [9,25-27]. None of the food and nutri-\nents chosen or reference methods used in the other studies\nwere exactly the same, but correlations from other studies\nshow that results from this study were similar to or better\nthan comparison studies of other new methods.\nBland-Altman method\nBland and Altman state that their plot is intended to assess\nwhether the variability of difference between measures is\nroughly constant across the range of measurements [28].\nThe small mean differences could mean that FoRC pro-\nvides a reasonable estimate for group intakes of the eight\nvariables of interest. There were wide limits of agreement\nfor all foods and nutrients shown in Table 1 (see Addi-\ntional file 1) and in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, implying\nthat individual results from FoRC should be interpreted\nwith care. For NSP (g), fruit and vegetables (g), bread (g)\nand breakfast cereal (g), there was a tendency for wider\ndifferences between methods as the average intake from\nFoRC and the diary increased, but the data was not so\nwidely spread as data for energy (kJ), fat (g) and percent-\nage food energy from fat.\nIt is likely that there was less variation between FoRC data\nand the diary for NSP and fruit and vegetables, as well as\nfor bread and breakfast cereal, as there were fewer subjec-\ntive choices to be made by the researcher when the data\nwas analysed. For example, 'bananas' were listed as a sin-\ngle item in FoRC, so the nutrient analysis of FoRC and the\ndiary would be identical where a participant had con-\nsumed a banana. Conversely, if the participant had con-\nsumed a muffin, the analysis would not be the same for\nboth methods, as this item would be accorded the average\nnutrient values for a 'cake' in FoRC, but would be analysed\nas a muffin in the diary. It may also be that FoRC reported\nhigher intakes of fruit & vegetables and foods high in NSP\nbecause these are typically healthy choices which may be\nmore likely to be recalled as they promote a more positive\nimpression of the individual diet [29].\nAdvantages of FoRC\nEntering four-day diaries into a dietary analysis package\nwas time-consuming. In comparison, FoRC took relatively\nlittle time to analyse. Average nutrient intakes could be\ncalculated in SPSS for a large number of participants at the\nsame time. Data collected in FoRC was returned precoded\nwith nutrient values for each item consumed, whereas\neach item recorded in the food diary had to be coded\nbefore daily average nutrient intakes could be calculated.\nFoRC partially eliminated the issue of subjective judge-\nments by researchers on which food code to assign to\nfoods reported in FoRC as each item was precoded with\nnutrient values. The only area of responsibility for catego-\nrising foods eaten was where participants had included\nitems in the 'other foods' section of FoRC. Print costs were\nover \u00a36.00 per diary, whereas Snap Survey Software was\naccessed for free, using the university site licence. Money\nsaved running FoRC online meant participants could be\noffered a prize draw incentive to take part.\nAsking participants to complete records online removed\nthe chance of researcher error when data was analysed in\nSPSS using the FoRC database. When unusual values were\nrecognised in the FoRC analysis database during pilot\nwork, these errors were rectified. FoRC was designed\nexplicitly for the sample population, so the definitions\nand terms used should have help to avoid misclassifica-\ntion errors made by participants. Variability between the\nresults from the two methods may have been in part due\nto natural variation in dietary intake during the two meas-\nurement periods and may not be a reflection of the poor\nperformance of one method in comparison with the\nother.\nLimitations\nThe number of responses to this study was low. An accu-\nrate response rate could not be calculated, because it was\nunclear how many individuals were exposed to recruit-\nment methods in the study. The response rate of 6.3%\nfrom students previously exposed to another health sur-\nvey highlights the difficulties of recruitment, even in par-\nticipants who have indicated they are interested in\nparticipating in health surveys. However, in other dietaryPage 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13studies in populations of similar age and education, num-\nbers of respondents were also low [9,27].\nThe sample in this study was unlikely to be representative\nof the general student population, given that it required\neight days participation and could not offer an incentive\nto every participant. Recruiting individuals from another\nhealth survey meant that students who took part were\nmore likely to be interested in health-related matters than\nthe general student population. A large number of stu-\ndents may have been left out of the recruitment process\nand students fatigued with other studies may have been\ndiscouraged from taking part. It is also likely that students\nwith a prior interest in healthy eating would have been\nmore motivated to take part and giving diet feedback as an\nincentive may have increased 'healthy subject' bias in the\nsample. The sample was not representative of male stu-\ndents at the university since 79% of the sample was\nfemale. However, it was likely that the study took place in\na sample representative of any future study populations\nwho would complete FoRC. It is possible that taking part\nin any dietary assessment survey may encourage partici-\npants to alter their food intake and this may affect whether\nthe results are a true reflection of habitual dietary intake.\nThe author was responsible for the calculation of the\nnutrient values to analyse FoRC as well as the food diary\nanalysis, so it is possible that there was greater matching\nof food items from the diary to similar items in FoRC,\nincreasing agreement between methods. However, apart\nfrom 'other foods' recorded, data returned from FoRC was\nprecoded, so it was not possible or the author to change\nfood code allocation after information was entered by\nparticipants. This issue was also potentially less damaging\nthan risking inter-researcher variation in diary analysis.\nSince dietary intake data is subjective for participants and\nresearchers, assumptions about food choices were made at\neach stage in the data entry and analysis, though FoRC\nwas designed with photographs, examples and portion\nguides, which should have removed some participant sub-\njectivity. However, if participants were unsure of where\nfoods they had consumed should be recorded in the\nchecklist they may have selected the incorrect category,\ninstead of using the 'other foods' section.\nIt is not known how accurately participants adhered to the\nstudy protocol. For example, it is possible that diaries\nwere completed at the end of the day, rather than through-\nout the day and that FoRC may have been completed at\nthe end of the day the record was about, rather than on the\nfollowing day. Although the diary was not subject to the\nsame errors of recall as FoRC, errors in portion size esti-\nmation by participants may have been similar in both\nmethods due to the use of food photographs for portion\nsize estimation in both methods.\nErrors in assigning nutrient values to foods in the FoRC\ndatabase and the diaries could have occurred as the UK\nfood composition tables are not complete. It was not pos-\nsible to avoid errors introduced by the participants in\nFoRC, e.g. the participants may have entered the number\nof portions consumed into the wrong box in FoRC, which\nwould have resulted in an incorrect estimate of their die-\ntary intake. Data entered in FoRC was subject to errors of\nrecall. The same photographs were used in FoRC and the\ndiaries, so good correlation between the two methods\nmay in part be due to participants becoming accustomed\nto the photographs. New colour photographs were used\nin both methods, instead of photographs from a food\natlas [30]. It would not have made sense to use different\nphotographs between the two methods and using the\nsame photographs in each method should not affect the\nresults of the study.\nThe Snap Survey Software questionnaire design package\ndid not have the capacity for certain design aspects. FoRC\ncould have greater capacity to prompt participants for for-\ngotten foods, in a manner similar to the Automated Mul-\ntiple Pass Method [31], but at this time it was limited by\nthe design software. However, making FoRC more com-\nplicated to complete might be off-putting for potential\nrespondents and increasing the amount of data collected\nin FoRC would make data analysis more complex and\ntime-consuming. The comparison made between the two\nmethods was four days diet from each record, so it was\nunlikely that methods would agree exactly and there was\na large chance that neither record was representative of the\nhabitual diet of students.\nConclusion\nData from four days of FoRC was shown to have high (r >\n0.5) correlation with four days non-weighed food diary\nfor energy (kJ), fat (g), NSP (g), fruit and vegetables (g),\nbread (g) and breakfast cereal (g). FoRC was quicker and\nmore cost-effective to implement and analyse than a food\ndiary and took advantage of a novel way to assess diet.\nFoRC could be used in place of a diary in this sample. Cor-\nrelation between FoRC and the reference method was\noften as good as or better than correlations found in other\nstudies, though comparison was limited due to lack of\nsimilarity between the studies. Although variation within\nindividuals was wide when FoRC was compared with a\nfour-day non-weighed food diary, group results from\nFoRC could be useful. Individual results from FoRC may\nnot be used to recommend precise dietary changes. How-\never, if used with appropriate caution, results from FoRC\nmay be used to tailor more general dietary messages\ntowards individuals.\nComparison studies of dietary assessment methods may\nbe difficult to implement due to lack of interest in dietaryPage 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2009, 8:13 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/8\/1\/13surveys amongst students, but FoRC was shown to com-\npare favourably to the reference method in terms of con-\nvenience, cost-effectiveness and avoiding data-entry\nerrors. Memory errors and misclassification of foods by\nparticipants may have occurred in the FoRC dietary assess-\nment method, but the advantages of the method were\nbelieved to outweigh the risk of these errors. FoRC was\ntherefore found to be an appropriate dietary assessment\nmethod for assessing diet in an undergraduate student\npopulation.\nFuture work\nThere are a number of improvements which could be\nmade to the existing FoRC questionnaire. For example,\nadvances in questionnaire software could allow partici-\npants to be prompted for food items which are likely to be\nconsumed together where one entry might remind partic-\nipants about another such as bread and butter, cereal and\nmilk, coffee and sugar. Participants could also be con-\nsulted on ways to improve the questionnaire. The next\nsteps are to develop healthy diet feedback messages tai-\nlored to data collected in FoRC which could be tested for\neffectiveness in an undergraduate student population.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nFC completed questionnaire design, recruitment, data col-\nlection and analysis and drafted the manuscript.
