We describe an assessment of goal neglect developed for administration to \npreschool children, and report data on two measures derived from this task alongside \nthe Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) and an Opposite-colour response-\ninhibition task. The propensity to neglect initial task cues was uniquely linked to \nresponse-inhibition, while neglect of a later cue was uniquely linked to the DCCS. \nAdditional evidence suggests that recovery from neglect can occur, and shows that \ngoal neglect varies with the cognitive transparency of the signifying cue. Data \ndemonstrate the importance of, and place constraints on, current theories of \ninformation-regulation, and foreground the notion of graded representations in \nworking memory and executive functioning.  \n \n 3 \nWhen knowledge is not enough: the phenomenon of goal neglect in preschool \nchildren \n \nThe hallmark of the cognitive revolution, to the extent that it existed \n(Greenwood, 1997; Leahey, 1992), has been the specification of information-\nprocessing models. Broadbent (1958) exemplified this approach, attempting to \ncapture the flow of information from the point when stimuli initially make an \nimpression on sensory registers through to response actions. More recently, however, \ncognitive psychology has increasingly focused on information-regulation, considering \nthe mechanisms for controlling mental representations and higher order goals. Whilst \npart of the information-processing approach, this more recent emphasis recognises the \npotential for both endogenous and exogeneous influences to modulate behaviour. \nInformation-regulation is partly synonymous with \u201cexecutive functions\u201d \n(Lehto, Juujarvi, Kooistra, & Pulkkinen, 2003; Miyake et al., 2000). These include, \nfor example, the ability to withhold responses to stimuli that would otherwise be \nproduced because of prior associations. Our contention, however, is that such \nregulation can only occur when behavioural goals or plans are represented with \nsufficient completeness and strength. That is, goals must be properly represented and \nfunctionally available so that cognition can be regulated towards their \naccomplishment (see also Zelazo, Carter, Reznick, & Frye, 1997). This forms an \nunder-researched area, and we seek to understand better the processes involved in \nyoung children\u2019s goal representation by studying instances of goal neglect. \n 4 \nWith reference to adult goal-directed behaviour, Duncan, Emslie, Williams, \nJohnson & Freer (1996) proposed the term goal neglect, \u201cto describe disregard of a \ntask requirement, even though it has been understood.\u201d (p. 265). This concept was \nargued to be relevant to the behaviour of frontal patients, for whom \u201cthere is a \nmismatch between what is known of task requirements and what is attempted in \nbehaviour\u201d (ibid).  Duncan et al. (1996) asked adults to perform a speeded monitoring \ntask with a number of sub-elements. Participants were directed by a central cue \n(\u201cWATCH LEFT\u201d or \u201cWATCH RIGHT\u201d) to one of two locations on a computer \nscreen and within a rapidly changing sequence they attempted to identify letters whilst \nignoring digits. A second central but abstract cue (a plus or minus symbol) briefly \nappeared and directed participants to one or other stimulus streams. Duncan et al. \nfound goal activation failure among some participants; the second cue - the second-\nside-instruction \u2013 was systematically ignored when it called for a change in \nmonitoring location, even though participants knew that they should respond to the \ncue. \nWe are not aware of published research that has directly mapped the concept \nand paradigm of goal neglect to the behaviour of preschool children. This is \npotentially an important lacuna. The goal neglect paradigm combines the \n\u2018endogenous\u2019 selective control of behaviour towards an experimentally defined goal \ntogether with a seemingly sporadic \u2018exogenous\u2019 cue in the form of the symbolic \nsecond-side-instruction. Added impetus for investigating whether and why children \nmight show goal neglect comes from developmental arguments that representations \n 5 \nare not all-or-none, but vary continuously in their strength (e.g., Munakata, Morton & \nYerys, 2003). This approach suggests that there is more to the implementation of \ngoals than their representation per se. Moreover, there is plentiful anecdotal evidence \nthat children are sometimes unsuccessful when asked to carry out prospective actions \nat particular times (when such and such happens, do X). They may ignore the \ninstruction at the point of performance. This adds further weight to the possibility that \ngoal neglect may represent an important concept for cognitive development. \nMoreover, there is a striking potential overlap with an independent theoretical \nframework that has been intensively investigated, the Cognitive Complexity and \nControl (CCC) model of development. CCC theory is also fundamentally concerned \nwith explaining \u201cdissociations between action and explicit knowledge\u201d (Zelazo, Frye \n& Rapus, 1996, p. 37) offering an explanation for \u201csituations in which children act \ninappropriately despite knowing what to do\u201d (ibid., p. 38).   \nCCC theory has been articulated with respect to the Dimensional Change Card \nSort (DCCS). Children sort bivalent cards into one of two trays, with the sorting \ncriteria changing half way through the task from one dimension to another  (e.g. from \nsorting by colour to sorting by shape). Children are made aware of the change in the \nsorting dimension, and they generally display good knowledge of the new \u2018sorting \nrules\u2019 if they are verbally interrogated. Despite this, 3-year-olds typically struggle to \nsort cards correctly by the post-switch rules, a process that is eventually mastered by \nthe age of 5. According the CCC theory, \u201can increase in complexity between 3 and 5 \nyears of age permits children to use a higher order rule to determine which of two \n 6 \nincompatible rules to use. In the card sort task, 3-year-olds know the preswitch rules; \nthey also know the postswitch rules. However, in the absence of a higher order rule \nthat operates on these two rule pairs, 3-year-olds cannot make a deliberate decision \nabout which rule pair to use and they persist in using the rules that are most strongly \nassociated with the task.\u201d (ibid., p.41). This view has been supported in later work \n(see Zelazo, M\u00fcller, Frye & Marcovitch, 2003). \nAt one level, goal neglect and DCCS paradigms represent very similar \nphenomena: knowledge about task requirements in general is not translated into \nappropriate behaviour at the specific point at which it is required. However, the \ntheoretical accounts are rather different. Duncan et al. (1996) suggest that goal neglect \narises from the failure to represent the mapping between cues and actions with \nsufficient saliency (and Kane, Conway, Hambrick & Engle, in press, link adult goal \nmaintenance to working memory capacity; see also Marcovitch, Boseovski & Knapp, \nin press). Zelazo and Frye (1998), in contrast, argue that DCCS errors occur when \nchildren cannot embed rule sets into a hierarchical structure. There are alternatives to \nthis embedded rule account, that focus instead on the sequential demands of moving \nfrom one task phase to another (e.g. Kirkham, Cruess & Diamond, 2003; Munakata & \nYerys, 2001; Perner & Lang, 2002; Towse, Redbond, Houston-Price & Cook, 2000). \nHowever, these different explanations often make overlapping predictions for DCCS \nperformance, which highlight the value of complementary paradigms. \nThis discrepancy between a shared descriptive language but different \ntheoretical viewpoints generates a potentially powerful opportunity. Of course, there \n 7 \nare substantial differences in studied populations, in the tasks used, and the conceptual \ncontexts relevant to the two paradigms. Nonetheless there is theoretical leverage to be \ngained by investigating whether goal neglect and DCCS actually involve just \nsuperficially similar concepts, or whether instead they share some commonality. In \nparticular, the DCCS was developed with respect to the requirements of hierarchical \nrule embedding (If it is the colour game, and if it is a red card, then\u2026). However, the \nadult goal neglect task requires participants to orient their attentional focus in \nresponse to an arbitrary cue independently of preceding instructions. Finding a \nrelationship between these two tasks would therefore emphasise the relevance of goal \nmaintenance and implementation as being at least a contributory factor in DCCS \nperformance.  \nSince the response to a goal-relevant cue involves a change from one mode of \nbehaviour to another \u2018mid stream\u2019, we entertained the possibility that inhibitory \ncontrol is important to prevent perseverative persistence of the existing task set. \nInhibitory control may also be important to guide attention on the basis of a transient \ncue, for example to prevent responding to preferred rather than target stimuli, or \nprevent responding to all stimuli instead of being selective. Therefore, we also \nadministered a Stroop-like inhibitory response task (Simpson & Riggs, 2005) to \nprovide a further measure of executive functioning. \nModifications to the goal neglect paradigm were necessary to make the task \ndevelopmentally appropriate. We specifically developed the selective image naming \ntask as an environment for assessing children. We slowed the pace down (though \n 8 \npreschool children nonetheless commented that events occurred quickly), reduced the \nnumber of stimuli and tried to make the task more motivating (the objective was to \nhelp a teddy bear find food rather than have participants respond to stimulus class; \nstimuli were images of objects rather than alphanumeric symbols). The original task \ninvolved incomplete responses; participants reported some stimuli and ignored others. \nPilot work suggested that preschool children encountered problems with the need to \ncombine object classification with response decision, and we thus used stimuli that \nwere always potential responses.  \nWe nonetheless preserved core elements of the original, adult, goal-neglect \ntask: in the initial test session, following a centrally presented cue, participants \nselectively attended off-centre to several screen events. Then a different (and abstract) \ncentrally presented cue appeared that directed participants to attend to one or other \nstimulus stream. On most (67%) trials this second cue involved a change in the \nlocation for the subsequent stimuli. On the remaining trials, the cue maintained the \nlocation that was already specified. Events occurred at an externally-paced, regular, \nrhythm.  \nIn a subsequent stage of the study conducted with a subset of children1, all \nexperimental trials involved a second\u2013side-instruction that required a switch in the \ntarget stimulus location. This was a potentially harder configuration since goal neglect \n                                     \n1 Testing carried over into the summer vacation period and some \nchildren were away for this phase. All available children were \ntested. \n 9 \nalways produces errors. It allowed a focus on children\u2019s goal maintenance for the \nsecond-side-instruction \u2018rule\u2019 because it consistently cued a change in what is \nrequired of children. This stage of the experiment was designed to address two \nimportant issues. First, trials explore the impact of task experience on preschoolers\u2019 \ngoal neglect. Duncan et al. (1996) reported that across blocks of contiguous trials \nwhere participants were reminded of task requirements, recovery from neglect \noccurred. Goal neglect errors were therefore not inevitable and permanent. Given that \nchildren also have the instructions explained to them again their performance might \nimprove too.  \nSecond, trials were designed to examine the relative efficacy of the two types \nof instruction cue \u2013 an abstract patch of colour vs. a more directive arrow. Duncan et \nal. (1996) described one experiment in which, in addition to the second-side-\ninstruction signal, there was an occasional dot probe that appeared above or below the \nalphanumeric stimuli. Participants responded by pressing one of two alternative keys \n(for high or low dot positions). Neglect of the dot response occurred although there \nwas \u2018spontaneous\u2019 behavioural recovery across trials. Duncan et al. speculated that \nthe nature of the cue (a dot located in a high or low position, relative to the abstract \n\u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201c second-side-instruction symbol) influenced the effectiveness of goal \nactivation. That is, participants\u2019 tendency to act on a goal-related cue may be related \nto the transparency or affordance of the stimuli. The mapping between the dot cue and \nthe response was more transparent and consequently, easier to implement as a \nbehaviour. We tested whether goal neglect is influenced by how strongly the stimulus \n 10 \nspecifies the appropriate response. In the first session, the first-side-instruction was \nalways an arrow and the second-side-instruction was a coloured square. In the \nsubsequent session we reversed these cues on half the trials.  \n \nMethod \n \nParticipants & Materials \n \nThirty-four children participated from 3 preschool groups with a mean age of \n49 months (SD=6.6 months, ranging 36 to 59 months, 16 girls and 18 boys). Parental \nconsent was sought according to preschool procedures. An Apple Macintosh \nPowerbook G4 (running PsyScript, an experiment generation environment) controlled \nthe SINT. Laminated sheets, cards and two black trays were used for the response-\ninhibition and DCCS tasks (for full details of DCCS materials, see Towse et al., 2000 \nExperiment 3). In the final session a sub-sample of 15 children completed additional \ntrials of the selective image naming task (mean age for this group of 8 girls and 7 \nboys was 46.5 months [SD=6.85], range 36 -58 months). \n \nProcedure \nIn the first test session the Experimenter introduced himself and invited \nchildren to play a game on a laptop computer. The game revolved around \u201cBobo\u201d, a \nhungry teddy bear shown on screen. Children were asked to help Bobo, who was \n 11 \nlooking for food in one of two houses. The houses appeared as blue and red outlines \non the left and right of the screen respectively. The experimenter explained that Bobo \nused a centrally placed (right- or left-facing) arrow and a (blue or red) square to tell \nchildren which house he had gone to (these cues formed what Duncan et al., 1996, \nterm the first-side-instruction, and second-side-instruction respectively. In other \nwords, they specified the target response location at the start of the trial and during the \ntrial, respectively). An initial example of each cue was shown to allow children to \nreport verbally where Bobo would be, and examples of food pairs gave them the \nopportunity to identify just the target food for Bobo (children were told that Bobo \nwould become confused if they named food in the other house). Finally, children were \nprompted to re-confirm that they knew the relevant task rules before experimental \ntrials began. \nThe red and blue houses were visible throughout each experimental trial. Each \ntrial began with the first-side-instruction arrow cue that appeared for 2 seconds, \nfollowed by a 1 second gap. Subsequently 5 food pairs appeared. Each pair contained \ntwo different food items shown simultaneously, with one food item shown inside each \nhouse for 2.5 seconds in sequence without gaps. The second-side-instruction colour \ncue then appeared for 2 seconds (with a 0.5 second gap, maintaining the pace of \ndelivery) followed by 3 further food pairs at the same pace as before2. Figure 1 \npresents a schematic, annotated, diagram of the event sequence. There were 18 food \n                                     \n2 These values report the programmed presentation rate. Actual times would have \nbeen marginally slower because of software delays, but these are negligible. \n 12 \nstimulus images, obtained from multiple sources (including public test libraries and \nInternet sites) and scaled to the same size. The computer sampled these images \nwithout replacement until exhaustion, and then resampled the pool. \nChildren completed 9 trials forming 3 sub-blocks. The experimenter initiated \nevery trial, permitting momentary pauses and encouragement. There was an additional \ninterval after 6 trials, with visual feedback comprising Bobo surrounded by food. \nExperimental sequences included a second-side-instruction that involved either a cue \nto shift monitoring location (a \u2018switch\u2019 trial) or a cue to maintain the search location \n(a \u2018stay\u2019 trial). Each block involved 1 stay trial and 2 switch trials, randomly ordered. \nIn a second session, carried out a few days after the first, children completed \nthe red-blue inhibitory and DCCS tasks, in randomized order. We administered a \nstandard DCCS procedure (Zelazo et al., 1996) using stimuli presented by Towse et \nal. (2000), Experiment 3. Children played a \u2018cats and birds\u2019 and \u2018reds and greens\u2019 \ngame, in different orders, sorting six test cards into one of two trays according to a \nshape or colour rule. The experimenter reminded children of the rules, test cards were \nlabeled for children, and they were sorted face down. The second rule set required \nchildren to reverse the sorting responses for the test cards. As is typical, after sorting \nthe final card, children were asked two knowledge questions concerning the post-\nswitch rules. \nTen trials of the red-blue inhibitory task adapted the procedure of Simpson & \nRiggs (2005; see Oh, 2006). Children played a \u201csilly game\u201d, in which the \nexperimenter named a colour, and they touched the opposite colour box on a \n 13 \nlaminated sheet in front of them. Thus, with the hand resting on a marked location, if \nthey heard the word \u201cblue\u201d, they were to touch the red box, and vice versa. They were \nthen to return to start location, whereupon the experimenter identified the next word. \nIn a third session 1-3 weeks later, some children completed further test trials \non the selective image naming task. These participants were re-invited to help Bobo \non the computer. The task was explained again in full. Each of 6 trials involved, as \nbefore, a first-side-instruction, five pairs of food images, a second-side-instruction, \nand then three further pairs of food images. Trials used the same stimulus set and \noccurred at the same pace as before. However, all second-side-instructions cued a \nlocation switch. Three trials used an initial arrow signal and a subsequent square \nsignal, and three trials used an initial square signal and a subsequent arrow signal; the \nsoftware compiled, for each child, a random order in which to present these six trials. \n \nResults  \nAdult goal neglect typically focuses on participants\u2019 failure to respect the \nsecond-side-instruction and change monitoring location (Duncan et al., 1996). \nHowever, the failure to implement all task relevant instructions can be observed in \ndifferent ways. Here, we noted two relevant response patterns on each trial. First, \nwhether a child failed to identify correctly the target stimuli on the majority of the \nfive stimuli pairs following the first-side-instruction. Second, we noted whether a \nchild failed to identify correctly the target stimuli on the majority of the three stimuli \npairs following the second-side-instruction. Thus, there were two types of goal \n 14 \nneglect reflecting different phases of the task. This pass \/ fail scoring threshold \u2013 \nbased on behaviour with respect to the majority of stimulus pairs \u2013 mirrors the \ncriterion used by Duncan et al., 1996. Choosing a non-target stimulus, reporting both \nstimulus pairs, or failure to respond all constituted goal-directed behavioural lapses \n(of which the most common was the failure to respond). We also scored performance \nin terms of the number of behavioural lapses to every stimulus pair following each \nlocation cue. However, this alternative (specific) measure correlated very highly with \nthe (global) number of trial errors with respect to the first-side-instruction \n(r(32)=.947, p<.001) and second-side-instruction, (r(32)=.808, p<.001)3. We therefore \nreport the original global measure in the analyses that follow. \nIn the first session, children completed 9 trials in 3 sub-blocks of the selective \nimage naming task. Since our focus is on failures to follow all the task instructions, \nwe express scores in terms of error frequency. The mean number of error trials (goal \ninappropriate behaviour in response to either the first-side-instruction or second-side-\ninstruction) out of three in each sub-block was 1.3 (SD=1.2), 1.0 (SD=1.08), and 1.3 \n(SD=1.12). It is apparent that at the level of group performance, children were able to \ncomplete some, but not all trials. The mean number of errors in response to the first-\nside-instruction and second-side-instruction separately was 1.85 (SD=1.96) and 1.75 \n(SD=1.56) respectively. Overall performance did not differ across sub-block, \n                                     \n3 We also found a strong association between the failure to respond and the total \nnumber of errors, r(32)=.824, p<.001, confirming the representativeness of the overall \nmeasure. \n 15 \nF(2,66)=2.60, p=.082, \u03b7p2=.145. Age was not a reliable associate of error frequency, \nr(32)=-.181, p=.304.  \nThe DCCS was measured in terms of sorting accuracy using the first set of \n(preswitch) rules and the second set of (postswitch) rules (adopting a failure threshold \nof least 2\/6 test cards). As is commonplace, DCCS performance then indicates \nwhether children succeed on both pre- and post-switch phases, or fail on at least one \nphase4; all children of the latter type answered knowledge questions correctly. For \nalignment with the selective image naming task, the score on the red-blue inhibitory \ntask reflected the number of incorrect responses (out of 10). Children who \nexperienced card sorting difficulties made more mistakes on the red-blue inhibitory \ntask (M=5.14, SD=3.94) than the children who succeeded (M=2.75, SD=3.27), a \ndifference that was marginally significant, t(32)=1.93, p=.063, \u03b72=.104. \nOverall, error frequency on the red-blue inhibitory task correlated with the \nnumber of error trials on the selective image naming task, r(32)=.663, p<.001 and \nmore specifically correlated with the frequency of neglect to both the first- and \nsecond-side-instruction (r(32)=.71, p<.001, and r(32)=.36, p=.036 respectively). \nSubsequent analysis revealed a dissociation between these two phases of the task. \nRed-blue inhibitory task errors correlated with first-side-instruction neglect after \npartialling out second-side-instruction neglect, r(31)=.67, p<.001, but not second-\nside-instruction neglect after partialling out first-side-instruction neglect, r(31)=.18, \n 16 \np=.328. This pattern of results is repeated when one also partials out the possible \nmediating role of age. Figure 2 shows that a dissociation is also found between task \nphases when one partials out the influence of age and the DCCS. \nOverall, problems on the DCCS correlated5 with the number of error trials on \nthe selective image naming task too, rpb(32)=.52, p=.002 and also correlated with the \nfrequency of neglect to the first- and second-side-instruction (rpb(32)=.37, p=.024 and \nrpb(32)=.52, p=.002 respectively). The two phases of the selective image naming task \nwere again dissociated, but the pattern was now reversed. DCCS problems did not \ncorrelate significantly with first-side-instruction neglect after partialling out second-\nside-instruction neglect, rpb(31)=.24, p=.174 but did correlate with second-side-\ninstruction neglect after partialling out first-side-instruction neglect, rpb(31)=.45, \np=.009 (age did not mediate these effects). Figure 2 shows the differential pattern of \nassociations holds also when one partials out age and the red-blue inhibitory task. \nIn summary, red-blue inhibitory errors correlate uniquely with neglect of the \nfirst signal, while DCCS problems correlate uniquely with neglect of the second \nsignal. While the frequency of neglect to the first and second signals correlated \noverall, r(32)=.37, p=.029, they evidently tap different regulatory functions.  \nMoreover, given that each phase of goal neglect correlates with a separate external \n                                                                                                       \n4 One child produced unusual performance, failing preswitch but passing postswitch \ntrials: yet analysis based on postswitch failures alone produces the same result profile. \n5 Since DCCS performance is dichotomous, these are point-biserial \ncorrelations. \n 17 \nmeasure, the dissociations in correlations cannot be attributed to differential \nreliability.  \nThe first session comprised (nine) trials of the selective image naming task in \nwhich the second signal either cued a location change or no change. The final session \ninvolved fewer (six) trials but they always involved switches. Despite this \nconfiguration, children\u2019s performance was better on the second assessment. In the \nfirst session failures occurred on 45% of trials for the relevant sample of children; this \nfell to 21% on the final session. This improvement was significant, t(14)=2.51, \np=.025, \u03b72=.382. The correlation between the previous and current performance was \nquantitatively substantial, but not significant with the current sample size, r(13)=.39, \np=.185 (the improved performance in the final session may have contributed to \nrestricted variability). \nAnalysis of goal compliance confirmed the relevance of cue type. Table 1 \nshows that children were more prone to behavioural lapses when the coloured square \nrather than the arrow provided the first-side-instruction or the second-side-instruction. \nCombining the lapses following the first and second signal, there were significantly \nmore task-related failures associated with the coloured square signal than the arrow, \nt(14)=2.17, p=.048, \u03b72=.252. Thus the stimulus cues differed in their potency for \nproducing goal-relevant behaviour. \n \nDiscussion \n 18 \nWe argue that the current implementation of a child-appropriate goal neglect \ntask, the selective image naming task, is useful and tractable. Some, but not all, \nchildren succeed at the experimenter paced, computer-based task. It is challenging, \nbut not beyond the capacity of all preschoolers. Moreover, the test environment is \nsufficiently engaging that young children will undertake a number of somewhat \nsimilar trials \u2013 over more than one session. The data establish that separable and \nindeed complementary components underlie performance, by virtue of the \ndissociations in correlations with different stages of the task.  \nThe data show that second-side-instruction neglect was not uniquely linked to \nthe response inhibition task. However, we do not take this to mean that responding to \nthis signal does not involve inhibition. Just as there are varieties of executive \nfunctions (Miyake et al., 2000; Towse & Houston-Price, 2001), we recognize that \ninhibition is not a uni-dimensional construct (Friedman & Miyake, 2004; Nigg, 2000). \nWe suggest, therefore, that goal neglect to the second-side-instruction is just more \nstrongly related to the ability to shift instructional set than to response inhibition.  \nIn the final session children\u2019s performance improved; they made fewer errors \neven though all the trials involved location switches. This is actually consistent with \nDuncan et al. (1996), who showed adults\u2019 recovery from goal neglect following \nfeedback and prompting. Since the task was explained again in full prior to the \nexperimental trials, we effectively reminded children of all the task goals. We \nconclude that this helped prompt them to attend to the location signals although we \nnote two further contributory issues. First, children would have been more familiar \n 19 \nwith the Experimenter and materials, which may have facilitated performance. \nSecond, since all second-side-instructions mandated a location switch so as to provide \na stronger test of goal maintenance the consistent mapping between instructions may \nhave increased the salience of the later cue for children6 although adherence to the \nfirst-side-instruction improved in the final session too. Whatever the cause the \nperformance improvement echoes the conclusion from Duncan et al. (1996) that \nneglect does not mean individuals are incapable of implementing the goal, merely that \nthey do not do so. This in turn suggests a possible link with research on children\u2019s \nproduction deficiencies (e.g. Bjorklund & Harnishfeger, 1990) where a strategy is not \nelicited even though children can be shown to be able to produce it. \nThe study also confirms that the configuration of the stimulus item is relevant \nto the implementation of goal directed behaviour. An arrow is a less abstract cue than \na coloured square for attentional selectivity.  We suggest that the arrow offers a more \ndirect or leading signal to children to respond to just one of a pair of visual images. \nThese results echo the deployment of a dot probe task by Duncan et al. (1996), and \nthey endorse the notion from Munakata, O\u2019Reilly & Morton (in press) that children\u2019s \nmental representations take graded rather than absolute values. That is, it is not \nsufficient simply to have a mental representation, per se. Instead one requires a \nsufficiently strong representation combined with a suitable exogenous signal so as to \naffect information processing. In this context, an arrow is stronger than a colour (a \n                                     \n6 Duncan et al. (1996) similarly note that drawing attention to the goal requirements \ncan affect task success. \n 20 \ndescription that is consistent with, for example, the perspective from natural and \nconventional symbols in Hala & Russell, 2001). \nTo succeed on the selective image naming task, children must implement a \nnumber of goal relevant behaviours. In the first phase of the task, they must encode \nand represent the initial signal. They must also look at the relevant spatial location \nand report just the stimulus that appears there. Children sometimes gave no report at \nall, and sometimes they reported the inappropriate stimulus instead of or as well as the \ntarget. Inhibiting the temptation to respond to the visual onset of stimuli (choosing to \nrespond selectively instead), or allowing attention to be captured by object onsets, \nmay contribute to the association with the red-blue inhibitory task. \nSubsequent task behaviour \u2013 whether children take appropriate account of the \nsecond signal, a colour patch \u2013 is linked instead with the DCCS. We suggest that both \ntasks require adequate representations of the relevant goal state (the implications of \nthe second-side-instruction in the former task or the change in rules in the latter). This \nassociation addresses one of the important questions motivating the present work; the \napparently similar language in describing dissociations between behaviour and action \nin the DCCS and goal neglect paradigms is more than coincidental. We argue that \nboth paradigms emphasise how knowledge itself is not enough to produce goal-\ndirected behaviour (see also Marcovitch et al., in press).  To be effective, internal \ngoals in the selective image naming task must be activated and salient, while the \nexternal eliciting signals must also be encoded and appropriately mapped onto those \ngoal representations.  \n 21 \nA comparison of the two tasks may well help to reveal patterns of \nperformance in each. There is likely to be an important dynamic between the \nendogenous representations of a goal and the exogenous stimuli that are relevant to it, \nsuch that some external cues have greater imperative force than others, as found in the \nfinal session. This implies that both the selective image naming task and DCCS place \ndemands on the adequate representation of the goal state. In the former, children need \nto do more than notice the colour patch. They must translate its significance (red = \nreport images in the red house, blue= report images in the blue house), as well as \noften overcome any inertia or perseveration merely to report from the current stimulus \nlocation. They must also maintain the goal of reporting the target object rather than \nfall back to a more passive monitoring state.  \nMapping this perspective onto DCCS performance, one might propose that \nchildren need to do more than learn the new rule information (e.g,, if the card is a car, \nit must be placed in the right-hand tray). Children must represent the now-relevant \ndimension in the test cards (that the card is a \u2018car\u2019), as well as overcome any inertia or \nperseveration to use preswitch sorting patterns (such as thinking about the card in \nterms of colour). This line of thinking does not rule out a CCC explanation in terms of \nembedded task rules, yet it focuses on the possibility that DCCS success depends on \nchildren making good their understanding of what test cards signify (Kirkham et al., \n2003; Towse et al., 2000). It is therefore especially compatible with the view that \nchildren\u2019s representations in the goal neglect and DCCS tasks are graded, not all or \nnone. Just as Munakata, et al. (in press) argue that DCCS information may be \n 22 \nrepresented at a level sufficient for responses to direct questioning but insufficient for \ntheir deployment on sorting trials themselves when conflict is present, the present \nevidence suggests that some cues may be sufficient to trigger behaviors whilst other \ncues \u2013for the same behavior \u2013do not. \nIn conclusion, we argue that studying goal neglect, via the selective image \nnaming task, provides valuable insights to the production of goal-directed behaviour \nin young children. The present data demonstrate that task performance can be \ncoherent, interpretable, and multi-faceted. Performance on this task can help to \nadvance our theoretical and conceptual understanding of the organization of \nrepresentations, and raise a number of questions for future research to address.  The \nresults illustrate the potential of the paradigm to constrain theories about the \nregulation of information-processing, and complement existing techniques for \nlearning how children come to develop executive skills. \n \nReferences \n \nBjorklund, D.
