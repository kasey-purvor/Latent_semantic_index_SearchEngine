Introduction \n \nThe Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change concluded that there can be \u201cno doubt\u201d the \neconomic risks of business-as-usual (BAU) climate change are \u201cvery severe\u201d (Stern, 2006, p188). The \ntotal cost of climate change was estimated to be equivalent to a one-off, permanent 5-20% loss in global \nmean per-capita consumption today. And the marginal damage cost of a tonne of carbon emitted today \nwas estimated to be around $312 (p344). These estimates are high in relation to the previous literature, \nas commentaries on the Review have already pointed out (e.g. Nordhaus, 2006; Tol and Yohe, 2007). \nFor instance, in his review of estimates of the marginal damage cost of a tonne of carbon emitted \napproximately today, Tol (2005) finds that the mean estimate from the wider literature \u2013 peer-reviewed \nand otherwise \u2013 is $122\/tC, while considering only the peer-reviewed literature it is $43\/tC. Indeed, \nsince the first wave of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs)2 of climate policy in the early-mid 1990s (e.g. \nCline, 1992; Fankhauser, 1995; Maddison, 1995; Manne et al., 1995; Nordhaus, 1991, 1994a; Peck and \nTeisberg, 1992; Plambeck and Hope, 1996; Tol, 1997), most have yielded low estimates of the cost of \nclimate change and recommended modest optimal greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions (with the \nnotable exception of Cline, 1992). \n \nOf course, the conclusions of this wider literature have been subject to criticism. Of the many \narguments made, we will engage with two in this paper. The first is that most CBA studies are limited \nto a relatively narrow set of the most measurable impacts, which turn out to be (not entirely by \ncoincidence) marginal to future economic development. They are particularly weak at representing the \npotential that does seem to exist for costs to escalate rapidly at high levels of global warming. This is \nlinked with a technical economic concern, namely that the most aggregated cost-benefit models \nimplicitly assume perfect substitutability between natural capital and other forms of capital (highlighted \nby Neumayer, 1999). But climate damage could, it is argued, deplete and degrade so-called \u2018critical\u2019 \nnatural capital, which is essential for human development and the loss of which can neither be reversed \nnor be compensated by increasing production and consumption of other goods and services. In this \npaper, we connect these concerns to recent discussions about \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change (see \nSchellnhuber et al., 2006). The second is that CBA studies inadequately represent the uncertainty that \nsurrounds the impacts of climate change (e.g. Azar, 1998; Roughgarden and Schneider, 1999; various \ncontributions to Climatic Change, 56(3)). These two criticisms are related, since one of the principal \nsources of uncertainty is that surrounding the likelihood of catastrophic climate damages and the \neconomic consequences of high levels of warming more generally. \n                                               \n2\n We use the term CBA quite loosely in this paper to capture any studies, which estimate the monetary costs of climate \nchange\/benefits of climate-change mitigation, the costs and benefits of mitigation together, or other closely related \nissues. \n 4\n \nThere are other criticisms. Traditionally, much of the focus has been on high discount rates (e.g. Azar \nand Sterner, 1996; Broome, 1992; Cline, 1992). We do not devote this paper to discounting, since it is \nwell known that the monetary cost of future climate change is highly sensitive to it (most recently \ndemonstrated by Guo et al., 2006). However, we will estimate the sensitivity of the Stern Review \ncalculations to increases in the components of the social or consumption discount rate, in order to put \nother factors in context. A further set of criticisms has been levelled at the welfarist ethical framework \nunderpinning CBA. Along this line of reasoning, it may be unethical to impose environmental damage \non future generations, as compensation by way of increased consumption of non-environmental goods \nis inadequate in principle (e.g. Barry, 1991; Spash, 1994). This also amounts to postulating that natural \nresources are non-substitutable, but on an a priori basis. Legitimate as alternative ethical frameworks \nare, in this paper we adopt an avowedly welfarist perspective. \n \nThe primary purpose of this paper is to show that the Stern Review\u2019s estimates depend heavily on its \nrelatively comprehensive treatment of risk and uncertainty on the one hand, and on its attempts to \nrepresent low-probability\/high-impact damage scenarios on the other. Moving from the least to the most \nencompassing modelling approaches in these respects makes a very substantial difference to the overall \nestimate of climate damage. Moreover, this difference is of a comparable magnitude to the differences \ncaused by alternative discounting assumptions, with the obvious and important proviso that, in most of \nthis analysis as in most others, a high (utility) discount rate renders largely irrelevant in present-value \nterms any serious consequences of climate change in the far-off future. That is to say, a low (utility) \ndiscount rate is almost always needed for uncertain, dangerous climate change in the far-off future to \nmatter.3 \n \nIn section two, we discuss in more detail how CBA studies can model \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change. We \nalso survey concerns about how CBA studies treat risk and uncertainty. This inevitably means that we \nmust mention discounting, since the estimation of social welfare losses due to climate change usually \ninvolves the application of the same utility function to the distribution of consumption across time, \nspace and risks or states of the world. Throughout section two, we clarify the assumptions of the Stern \nReview\u2019s IAM and welfare valuation and in section three, we provide additional details about them. \nSection four reports our results and section five provides a discussion. \n \n                                               \n3\n On the other hand, we present some scenarios in this paper, in which the combination of the risk of very high climate \ndamages and high risk aversion leads to high overall estimates, in present-value terms, even with a higher utility \ndiscount rate. More generally, if it could be demonstrated that the impacts of climate change in the short to medium \nterm are very high, then the influence of the utility discount rate would be reduced. \n 5\n2. Dangerous and uncertain climate change \n \n2.1. Dangerous climate change in integrated assessment models \n \nIt has often been observed that the integrated assessment models (IAMs) used in cost-benefit studies are \nlimited to a relatively narrow set of the most measurable impacts, a point systematically made by \nDowning et al. (2005). In particular, very few IAMs have been extended to cover large-scale, \ndiscontinuous changes to the climate system. And none have yet been explicitly extended to cover so-\ncalled \u2018socially contingent\u2019 impacts, which are large-scale, \u2018second-round\u2019 socio-economic responses to \nclimate change like conflict and migration. Since there appears to be a correlation between the \nmeasurability of impacts and their potential magnitude, such that many of those we understand least \nhave the potential to be highly damaging, we might reasonably conclude that most IAM studies are \nrestricted in their capacity to simulate the potentially rapid escalation of climate damages as warming \nproceeds. While perhaps not the most likely scenario, such an escalation is plausible and thus its \nomission is serious, which is the basic source of a criticism levelled by Neumayer (1999). For him, \nCBA studies deny the possibility that GHG emissions are depleting and degrading natural resources, \nwhich are essential for human development and the loss of which can neither be reversed nor be \ncompensated by increasing production and consumption of other goods and services. Technically, these \nare essential, non-substitutable natural resources, or \u2018critical\u2019 natural capital assets. \n \nThese arguments provide a point of contact between the cost-benefit tradition and the recent framing of \nclimate impacts in terms of \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change. Article 2 of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) calls for stabilisation of atmospheric GHG concentrations \nsuch that \u2018dangerous anthropogenic interference\u2019 with the climate system is prevented (United Nations, \n1992), so the term \u2018dangerous\u2019 is of both academic and political importance. Nevertheless, over fifteen \nyears of debate on the meaning of dangerous climate change has resulted in many definitions (Dessai et \nal., 2004; Schneider and Lane, 2006). This is unsurprising, since what is dangerous is ultimately a value \njudgement. Thus global CBA of climate policy makes just one of many possible interpretations of \ndanger. The value judgements it makes are based on preference-satisfaction utilitarianism, which is \nalmost always made operational by aggregating all of the effects of climate change on to a single \nmetric, consumption-equivalent welfare or utility. This is calculated for a representative consumer \nworldwide (i.e. one global, very long-lived consumer) and discounted across time-periods. Different \nconsumers may represent different world-regions and different states of the world. \n \n 6\nDangerous climate change might then be defined as any process that produces losses in consumption-\nequivalent welfare, which are both rapid and large-scale relative to global trend consumption. What \nconstitutes rapid and large-scale is arbitrary: there is no a priori basis for drawing the line between \ndangerous and \u2018non-dangerous\u2019 at any particular rate or level of welfare loss. Nevertheless, we can \nprovide a little more clarity by focussing on the processes by which they are brought about. These are \nthe very same large-scale, discontinuous changes to the climate system and rapid, large-scale socio-\neconomic responses to climate change, which most IAM studies fail to incorporate. Without them, \nlosses in welfare-equivalent consumption over the next two centuries are predicted to reach just a few \npercent of global output, relative to estimates without climate change. Given that trend growth in global \nconsumption per capita is often projected to average around 1% per annum or more over the same time \nperiod, this is at most a very small \u2018blip\u2019 on the global growth path. With them, comparable losses can \nrun into many tens of percent of global output, impacts which we might label \u2018dangerous\u2019. \n \nThis demands a close examination of the pathways along which IAMs can simulate dangerous climate \nchange, as we have defined it. Evaluating the Stern Review further requires that we understand to what \nextent its models did so. It is expositionally convenient (i.e. in terms of how they are actually \nrepresented by IAMs) to distinguish between three such pathways: \n1. Rapid, large-scale impacts of gradual climate change; \n2. Abrupt, discontinuous and large-scale positive natural feedbacks in the climate system that \naccelerate global warming; \n3. Other abrupt, discontinuous and large-scale changes to the climate system that have more direct \neconomic impacts. \n \nThe first comprises rapid, large-scale impacts of what we might call \u2018gradual\u2019 climate change. In the \nmost aggregated IAMs like DICE (Nordhaus, 1994a) and PAGE (Hope, 2006), the latter of which was \nused by the Stern Review, this pathway is represented by a damage function that relates overall impacts, \non consumption- or income-equivalent welfare4, to an index of global mean temperature. Generally, this \nfunction is calibrated first through an estimate of overall impacts at 2.5\u00b0C or 3\u00b0C warming and second \nthrough an estimate of the functional form that traces impacts from zero warming, through the estimate \n                                               \n4\n The relationship between consumption and income\/output depends on the marginal propensity to save, which may be \nendogenous to the model or set exogenously. In the Stern Review modelling, the saving rate is a constant 0.2, so \nconsumption-equivalent losses can simply be scaled to income-equivalent losses. However, the role of endogenous \nsaving, and in turn investment, is potentially important. Reactions to gross saving could dampen the negative impacts of \nclimate change, if agents wish to compensate for the faster depreciation of the capital stock due to climate change. On \nthe other hand, it could amplify them, in the main because capital is less productive due to climate change and thus the \nrate of return on saving is lower. The effect on net saving, however, is unambiguously negative, because the positive \nincentive to offset capital depreciation nets out (Fankhauser and Tol, 2005). \n 7\nfor 2.5\u00b0C\/3\u00b0C warming, and beyond to higher global mean temperatures. A very simple specification of \nthe functional form, in this case with respect to 2.5\u00b0C warming, is as follows: \n \n\u03b3\n\u03b2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n=\n5.2\n)()( tTtd\n          (1) \n \nWhere T is warming at time t, in terms of global mean temperature above pre-industrial, d(t) is the \neconomic damage caused by climate change expressed as a fraction of consumption or income, \u03b2 is the \nconsumption loss accompanying 2.5\u00b0C warming and \u03b3 is the damage function exponent. \n \nIAM studies are in broad agreement that the impacts of climate change at 2.5\u00b0C-3\u00b0C warming are small \nin relation to trend growth in global consumption (i.e. growth forecast in a world without climate \nchange, which may be exogenous or endogenous to the model). The 2001 IPCC Third Assessment \nReport (TAR) summarised the literature to that point, putting estimates roughly in the range of a 0% to \n2% loss in gross world product (Smith et al, 2001). But for higher global mean temperatures, there is \ngreater disagreement between studies and the possibility that impacts escalate rapidly. This is because \nthe damage function exponent, \u03b3, strongly affects such estimates. Figure 1 illustrates the differences \nbetween cost estimates, as a function of global mean temperature, for different values of \u03b3. For \nsimplicity, estimates are normalised to 2.5\u00b0C warming. \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n \nFigure 1 reflects the range that \u03b3 has taken in previous studies (e.g. Hope, 2006; Nordhaus, 1994a; \nNordhaus and Boyer, 2000; Peck and Teisberg, 1992; Plambeck and Hope, 1996; Roughgarden and \nSchneider, 1999). Where \u03b3 equals 1 \u2013 i.e. impacts are a linear function of warming \u2013 5\u00b0C warming \nreduces GWP by twice as much as 2.5\u00b0C warming, so damage is 2% of GWP at 5\u00b0C warming if \u03b2=1, \n4% if \u03b2=2 and so on. However, where \u03b3 is set to 3, it brings about a loss around 8 times larger at 5\u00b0C \nthan at 2.5\u00b0C, and increasing rapidly. At 6\u00b0C warming, the loss is 14 times as large. The PAGE model \nused by the Stern Review (Hope, 2006) draws \u03b3 from a triangular probability density function with a \nminimum of 1, mode of 1.3 and maximum of 3 (giving a mean of about 1.8). So there is a small \nlikelihood of rapidly escalating economic impacts beyond those assumed by most other IAM studies (an \nexception is the sensitivity analysis of Peck and Teisberg, 1992, which also tests \u03b3=3). \n \nA major note of caution must be sounded at this stage: \u03b3 is essentially assumed, since the underlying \nimpact studies on which IAMs are reliant become very sparse in the range of 4-5\u00baC warming and \n 8\nbeyond. We possess some sector-specific evidence (see especially the review of Hitz and Smith, 2004), \nbut this is certainly insufficient to illuminate the overall picture. There are a number of basic biological \nand physical principles indicating that impacts in many sectors will become disproportionately more \nsevere with rising temperatures (Stern, 2006). On the other hand, estimates of \u03b3 in equation (1) are \ncurrently much less reliable than those of \u03b2 (e.g. Mendelsohn, 2006).  \n \nFor convenience, we treat the impacts of gradual climate change, pathway one, as distinct from the \nimpacts of abrupt, discontinuous and large-scale changes to the climate system. In the set-up of a \ntypical IAM, these changes, which have been called \u2018macro-discontinuities\u2019 (Smith et al., 2001, p947), \nare further divided into two separate pathways. Pathway two comprises the large-scale release of GHGs \nfrom sinks, which constitutes a positive natural feedback to global warming by accelerating the overall \natmospheric build-up of GHGs. A number of studies have considered the threat that climate change \ncould pose for terrestrial biospheric and oceanic carbon sinks (e.g. Friedlingstein et al., 2006, for \nterrestrial sinks and Orr et al., 2006, for oceanic sinks), as well as whether the melting of permafrost \nand the warming and drying of wetland areas could produce large amounts of methane (e.g. Davidson \nand Janssens, 2006; Gedney et al., 2004). More speculative is the release of methane from vast oceanic \nstores of gas hydrates (Hadley Centre, 2005). There would be direct economic impacts associated with \nthese macro-discontinuities. For example, melting permafrost would damage Arctic infrastructure, \nassuming no adaptive measures. But in IAMs, the consequence of GHG sink releases is indirect: \nthrough the acceleration in the accumulation of atmospheric GHGs they induce and the consequences of \nthe extra warming that results. \n \nAbrupt, discontinuous and large-scale positive natural feedbacks are uncertain and as such have \nreceived virtually no attention in IAM studies to date. One exception is Ceronsky et al. (2005), which, \nin a sensitivity analysis, looks at the dissociation of methane hydrates and its consequences for the \nmarginal damage cost of carbon. Another is the Stern Review, which specifies a high-climate scenario \nto take account of recent quantitative modelling of positive natural feedbacks. To be more precise, the \nscenario is based on recent estimates of a temperature-dependent weakening of natural carbon \nabsorption (Friedlingstein et al., 2006) and increased natural methane releases from permafrost and \nwetlands (using a probability distribution based on recent studies such as Gedney et al., 2004). \nTogether, these feedbacks add 0.4\u00baC to mean warming in 2100 compared with the Review\u2019s baseline-\nclimate scenario, which replicates the range of warming projections in the IPCC TAR5, and an \nadditional 1.2\u00baC in 2200. The baseline-scenario estimates are 3.9\u00baC and 7.4\u00baC respectively. \n \n                                               \n5\n The baseline-climate scenario includes a modest positive feedback, as indeed do most other IAM studies. \n 9\nPathway three comprises the other, wider class of macro-discontinuity in the climate system, such as a \nregional or global shutdown of the Thermohaline Circulation, rapid melting of the Greenland and West \nAntarctic Ice Sheets, transformation of continental monsoons or modification of the El Nino Southern \nOscillation. These non-linear changes are difficult to predict, but are plausible given what is known \nabout the chaotic nature of the climate system and past climate changes. If they did occur, these would \nhave direct economic impacts. So far, only two IAMs have built the possibility of these kinds of macro-\ndiscontinuities into their core model structure. The pioneering estimates were included in DICE\/RICE-\n99 (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000). The Stern Review IAM, PAGE, also includes the risk of catastrophe. \nWhen global mean temperature rises to a threshold level (a minimum of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial, mode \nof 5\u00b0C, and maximum of 8\u00b0C), the chance of large losses in GDP in the range of 5-20% begins to \nappear (minimum 5%, mode 10%, maximum 20%). This chance increases by an average of about 10 \npercentage points per \u00baC rise in global mean temperature (minimum 1, mode 10, maximum 20). \n \n ))(()( TRIGGERTtTtd \u2212= \u03b6\u03b8          (2) \n \nWhere \u03b6 is the loss in GDP if a macro-discontinuity occurs, \u03b8 is the probability of a macro-discontinuity \nand TTRIGGER is the threshold global mean temperature, above which a macro-discontinuity becomes \npossible. Thus the risk of direct impacts from abrupt, large-scale and discontinuous climate change is \nmodelled as a subjective joint probability. The probability density functions were calibrated on \ninformation presented in the IPCC TAR, although the TAR never addressed the issue directly. In \nparticular, the TAR presented some evidence on TTRIGGER, but almost none on \u03b8 and \u03b6, except for some \norder-of-magnitude quantification. In short, equation (2) is a genuine guesstimate, and that is why the \nranges used for the parameters are so wide. \n \nIn summary, it is evident that some IAMs, such as the PAGE model used by the Stern Review, can \nmodel high-damage scenarios globally in at least one of three ways. But how can this be reconciled \nwith the criticism that the very same models ignore the possibility of natural capital, which is essential \nand non-substitutable (Neumayer, 1999)? The essence of the critique is that the production and utility \nfunctions specified in CBA studies of climate policy derive from the tradition of \u2018weak\u2019 sustainable \ndevelopment, in which it is generally assumed that natural capital is perfectly substitutable (see \nNeumayer, 2003). But, in fact, CBA studies do not directly address the question of substitutability at \nall. Natural capital is not a separate argument in their production functions. Nor is it usually a separate \nargument in their utility functions (but see e.g. Tol, 1994). Instead, the impacts of climate change on the \nstock of natural capital enter the production and consumption calculus indirectly. To be precise, they in \neffect enter the production function as a multiplying coefficient, for example as follows: \n 10\n \n \n\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212\n+\n=\n1)()()()(1\n1)( tLtKtA\ntd\ntQ         (3) \n \nEquation 3 is a standard Cobb-Douglas production function in which output Q is a function of man-\nmade capital K, labour L and (exogenous) technological progress A. \u03b1 is the share of total output to \nman-made capital and 1-\u03b1 is the share of total output to labour. This is the production function used, for \ninstance, in Nordhaus (1994a). Some IAMs like PAGE simplify the representation of production by \ntaking an exogenous trend (e.g. Hope, 2006). Importantly, the total output available to the economy is \nmultiplied down by climate damage 1\/(1+d(t)). This includes impacts on market sectors of the economy \n\u2013 an impact on production \u2013 and direct impacts on, for example, human health and ecosystems. The \nlatter is a direct impact on welfare-equivalent consumption, but is indirectly treated as a loss in \nproduction.  \n \nClimate damage in equation (3) is the sum of equations (1) and (2), so it is perfectly feasible to simulate \ndamages, which become so high under a plausible warming scenario that income is eventually dragged \ndown to subsistence levels.6 This can be interpreted as a scenario analogous to the depletion and \ndegradation of critical natural capital due to GHG emissions. Admittedly, it is a very crude \napproximation. The problem can only be directly tackled once natural capital and its goods and services \ndirectly enter the production and utility functions respectively, such that their relative prices can rise to \nreflect their increasing scarcity. And it is a smooth function. So Neumayer (1999) is correct in a strict \nsense. But beyond this, the effect on policy of both approaches to the problem is broadly the same: i.e. \nstabilise atmospheric GHG concentrations at a low level to avoid damages of these magnitudes. The \nmethod employed by cost-benefit studies is indirect, but the basic modelling structure permits \nevaluation of the consequences of exceeding critical thresholds in the climate system, beyond which \neconomic activity is severely threatened. In the limit, such analysis can be been extended to simulate a \ndiscontinuous damage function, whereby exceeding some climate threshold (indexed to global mean \ntemperature) brings about very rapidly increasing damages (similar to the \u2018hockey-stick\u2019 function in \nManne and Richels, 1995). Whether this is a plausible specification is an empirical question, although it \nis quite reasonable to then ask how sure we can be that is implausible. So it is to uncertainty that we \nnow turn. \n \n                                               \n6\n Indeed, if damages are not bounded from above, then income can become negative. This is discussed in more detail \nbelow, especially in footnote 7. \n 11\n2.2. Modelling uncertainty \n \nAll the links in the chain between GHG emissions and the economic impacts of climate change \u2013 each \nof which needs to be parameterised in an IAM \u2013 are subject to uncertainty. Many of the parameters \nrelated to modelling dangerous climate change are subject to particular uncertainty. Yet CBA studies \nhave not always chosen to tackle this uncertainty directly. The simplest modelling strategy in the \nliterature is deterministic, whereby a \u2018best guess\u2019 is made for each parameter. This is still very common \nand would in many respects preclude the analysis of dangerous climate change, since the highest-\ndamage scenarios plausible are far from the most likely. \n \nNevertheless most IAMs have also been set up at one time or another to run a Monte Carlo procedure, \nwhich makes repeated random draws of each parameter from its probability distribution. This enables \nclimate impacts to be modelled probabilistically (e.g. Hope, 2006; Mastrandrea and Schneider, 2004; \nPlambeck et al., 1997; Roughgarden and Schneider, 1999). However, it is still somewhat limiting. First, \nthe model structure remains deterministic. Second, the data from which IAM parameter distributions \nare calibrated often comprise different best guesses from underlying studies, rather than a full estimate \nof uncertainty within these studies. Thus probabilistic IAMs remain likely to underestimate overall \nuncertainty. \n \nMoreover, very few of these studies extend to a proper application of expected-utility analysis \n(exceptions are Tol, 1999 and 2003), which enables a meaningful valuation of relative climate risks. An \nintermediate step is to generate a probability distribution of consumption, but then to calculate the \n(discounted) utility of mean consumption, in other words the utility of expected consumption. This is an \nincomplete application of the economics of risk of course (in the framework set out by von Neumann \nand Morgenstern, 1944), because we need to preserve information about the probability distribution of \nconsumption in order to similarly value the probability distribution of social welfare. \n \nWhat is required to support expected-utility analysis is the computation of discounted utility along each \nof the model\u2019s Monte Carlo draws. This is the core of the welfare valuation performed in the Stern \nReview. Begin by specifying the utility of the representative consumer as a simple, iso-elastic function \nof consumption per capita in the standard way: \n \n \n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n1\n)()(\n1tc\ntu            (4) \n \n 12\nWhere u is utility per capita, c is consumption per capita and \u03b7 is (the negative of) the elasticity of \nmarginal utility with respect to consumption. There is an important wrinkle at this point, namely that \u03b7 \ndoes up to three jobs. Positive \u03b7 assumes the marginal utility of increments in consumption falls as \ninitial consumption rises. Insofar as consumption is changing over time, it therefore becomes a  \nmeasure of intertemporal inequality aversion (the elasticity of intertemporal substitution). Since \nconsumption usually rises over time, it is usually a positive argument in the consumption discount rate \n(see below). In a regionally disaggregated model, it would similarly be a measure of inter-regional \ninequality aversion. And in a Monte Carlo model, it serves as a coefficient of (relative) risk aversion, \nquantifying the degree to which the representative consumer is averse to states of the world in which \nconsumption is particularly low. So \u03b7 captures the marginal valuation of climate costs over time, space \nand states of the world (Monte Carlo draws). This goes a long way to explain conflicts over what is the \nappropriate value of \u03b7 (compare Dasgupta, 2006; Gollier, 2006; Nordhaus, 2006; and Quiggin, 2006). \n \nDiscounted per-capita utility is given by: \n \ndttuw t\nt\n\u03b4\u2212\n\u221e\n=\n\u222b= exp)(\n0\n          (5) \n \nWhere w is discounted utility per capita and \u03b4 is the pure rate of time preference or utility discount rate. \nFinally, with exogenous population, we would automatically weight by population to derive our \naggregate social welfare or objective function: \n \n dttutNW t\u03b4\u2212\n\u221e\n\u222b= exp)()(\n0\n         (6) \n \nWhere W is social welfare and N is population. Every possible outcome i of climate change (i is a \nMonte Carlo draw), which has associated with it a probability p, should be evaluated with the social \nwelfare function in equation (6). If we were also able to measure consumption and the impacts of \nclimate change in different world-regions, then W should be calculated separately for each region. This \nis an item for further work. We are now able to compute expected utility for the probability distribution \nof consumption paths simulated to follow from a policy choice: \n \n E \u2211\n=\n=\nN\ni\niiWpW\n0\n)(           (7) \n \n 13\nWhere E denotes the expectation, for possible outcomes i=1,\u2026,N. Thus we are discounting \nendogenously, and every possible consumption path will have a unique set of discount factors, and \nhence a unique average discount rate, associated with it. For any given Monte Carlo draw, the familiar \nRamsey (1928) formula for the consumption discount rate is: \n \n )()( t\nc\nc\ntr\ni\ni\ni\n&\u03b7\u03b4 +=           (8) \n \nWhere r is the consumption discount rate specific to Monte Carlo draw i. This is also an important \npoint: some studies that do preserve the probability distribution of social welfare apply an exogenous \ndiscount rate (e.g. Hope, 2006). But this assumes growth in consumption that will not actually be \nrealised by the Monte Carlo draw on which it operates (except by coincidence or where climate-change \ncosts are on the whole minimal). The likely empirical consequence is an underestimate of the cost of \nclimate change (Dietz et al., 2006). \n \nTol (2003) notes that, for expected-utility analysis to be applicable, the costs of climate change must \nexhibit finite variance. His IAM, FUND, is specified to exhibit finite variance in its parameters (like \nPAGE), but convergence problems can nevertheless occur if consumption growth becomes persistently \nnegative due to climate change. Discounting endogenously, the discount factors on one of his Monte \nCarlo draws become infinite.7 The more general question is whether climate change can really be \ndescribed as a situation of \u2018risk\u2019, in the sense that we know the full set of possible outcomes and their \nassociated objective probabilities? In fact, many elements of the overall incertitude attached to the \nconsequences of GHG emissions would better be described as situations of uncertainty, in the \nKnightian sense (Knight, 1921). That is, we do not know their objective probabilities. Whether CBA \nremains a meaningful decision-support tool then depends on our ability to define subjective probability \ndistributions over the relevant variables. This is the necessary core of any stochastic modelling \napproach. If our ability to do so is very limited \u2013 or indeed if we are simply \u2018ignorant\u2019 of climate \noutcomes in the sense that we cannot even foresee what they will be, let alone how likely they are \u2013 \n                                               \n7\n We cap impacts at 99% of GWP, in order to avoid this problem, which is quite likely in a damage function with a high \nexponent. Simply put, with high \u03b3 and save for very optimistic assumptions about adaptation, climate damage will \ninevitably exceed 100% of regional or global GWP if warming is allowed to increase sufficiently (e.g. to just under 6\u00baC \nabove pre-industrial where \u03b3=3, \u03b2=2 and there is no adaptation at all). Losses in GWP equal to, or in excess of, 100% \nstretch plausibility and should not in themselves cause us to abandon expected-utility analysis in favour of a \nspecification that ignores uncertainty. In any case, with our analysis confined to the global level, this cap is highly \nunlikely to come into effect, except for one or two draws in the high-climate scenario (i.e. it rarely gets hot enough, \neven by the end of the modelling horizon in 2200). If the analysis is taken to the regional level, it may prove more \nimportant, as impacts in the poorest regions are additionally multiplied by a weight. \n 14\nthen so is the applicability of CBA.8 Thus in presenting results for a baseline-climate scenario and a \nhigh-climate scenario \u2013 two discrete probability distributions \u2013 the Stern Review was quite explicit in \npointing out that the relative likelihoods of the two distributions are unquantified. The decision problem \nis quite different in this case, essentially leading to an informal application of the precaution principle \n(Stern, 2006, p38-39). \n \n3. Model description \n \nThe 2002 version of PAGE (hereafter PAGE2002) is comprehensively described in Hope (2006) and, \nunless otherwise stated, we make no changes to the parameters reported therein. The primary features \nof the model are as follows: \n\u2022 Emissions of carbon dioxide and methane (including natural emissions stimulated by climate \nchange in the model), as well as SF6, and other GHGs that contribute to background radiative \nforcing (e.g. NO2 and (H)CFCs); \n\u2022 The accumulation of anthropogenic GHG emissions in the atmosphere and resulting radiative \nforcing; \n\u2022 Regional temperature increases arising from the difference between greenhouse warming and \nregional cooling brought about by sulphate aerosols; \n\u2022 Climate damage is a regional function of increases in regional mean temperature, as described \nin general-form in equation (1), but with the addition of adaptation (see below); \n\u2022 Region-specific impacts of gradual climate change in two main sectors \u2013 (a) \u2018market\u2019 sectors of \nthe economy like agriculture and energy and (b) direct welfare impacts on ecosystems and \nhuman health (\u2018non-market\u2019 sectors). With respect to equation (1), each sector has a unique \nprobability distribution for \u03b2 but the distribution for \u03b3 is common to both; \n\u2022 Adaptation, which requires costly investment, increases a time-varying tolerable level of \nclimate change before damage to market sectors arises and reduces the intensity of impacts on \nboth market and non-market sectors above the tolerable level; \n\u2022 The possibility of a future macro-discontinuity, as per equation (2). \n \n31 key inputs to the model are stochastic and we take 1000 Monte Carlo draws. The density functions \nfor the various parameters are calibrated on the underlying scientific and economic literatures on \n                                               \n8\n Broader social-scientific perspectives on uncertainty also point to \u2018ambiguity\u2019 or \u2018fuzziness\u2019 (e.g. Stirling, 1998), in \nthe sense that the probabilities of different climate outcomes might be known (at least subjectively in terms of \ntemperature, sea-level, precipitation and so on), but the consequences of these outcomes can be interpreted in different \nways (i.e. how do we weigh up economic, social and ecological impacts?). CBA of course finesses this element of \nincertitude by imposing a particular value framework. \n 15\nclimate change. Thus PAGE2002 is essentially meta-analytical and has in the past been shown to \nproduce results, for instance with respect to the marginal damage cost of carbon (calculated without full \nexpected-utility analysis), close to the centre of a range of peer-reviewed studies (cf. Hope, 2006 with \nTol, 2005). Assumptions particular to the Stern Review and this paper are reported in table 1. \n \nTABLE 1 HERE \n \n4. Results \n \nWe begin with a brief summary of the undiscounted cost of climate change through time (figures 2 and \n3), starting in 2050. Figure 2 traces the mean percentage loss in GWP, as well as the range of losses \nfrom the 5th to the 95th percentile, for the baseline-climate scenario. Figure 3 does the same for the high-\nclimate scenario. \n \nFIGURES 2 AND 3 HERE \n \nThe cost of BAU climate change in figures 2 and 3 is the sum of climate-change impacts and adaptation \ncosts, but in practice the latter are very small in comparison. Thus the figures trace the global damage \ncosts of climate change simulated by PAGE2002. Two key features become apparent. The first is that \nthe greater portion of undiscounted damages fall in the second half of the modelling horizon, between \n2100 and 2200. In the baseline-climate scenario, mean damages are 2.6% of GWP in 2100, but 11.3% \nin 2200. In the high-climate scenario, they are 2.9% in 2100 and 13.8% in 2200. This is due to the \nconvexity assumed in the damage functions, as well as the increased risk of a macro-discontinuity with \ndirect impacts, neither of which has a strong effect until regional temperatures are sufficiently high, \nmostly after 2100 (higher of course in the high-climate scenario, due to the positive natural GHG \nfeedback). The second is uncertainty around the mean estimates. The 5-95% confidence interval \nbecomes increasingly wide as time passes and by 2200 it spans a range from 2.9% to 29.4% of GWP in \nthe baseline-climate scenario and from 2.9% to 35.2% of GWP in the high-climate scenario. \n \nFigures 2 and 3 present the dynamic costs of climate change relative to consumption growth in a world \nwithout climate change. The socio-economic scenario used by the Review (table 1) puts that growth at \nan average of 1.3% per capita per annum over the period 2001-2200. Global average per-capita \nconsumption rises from around $6000 in 2001 to $79000 in 2200. This trend growth is far in excess of \nthe damage caused by climate change, so that, even under the 95th percentile damages in the high-\n 16\nclimate scenario, consumption is higher in 2200 than it is now (c. $41000). Furthermore, even under \nthese damages, consumption growth is positive over the whole modelling horizon.  \n \nPreliminaries aside, we now test the sensitivity of the Stern Review\u2019s estimates to two key elements of \nthe welfare valuation of climate damages: the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption \u03b7 and the \npure rate of time preference or utility discount rate \u03b4. Thus we briefly put the forthcoming results in \ncontext, by establishing how sensitive estimates are to discounting. But due to the dual role of \u03b7, we \nalso gain some sense of the importance of risk aversion compared with intertemporal inequality \naversion. \n \nTables 2 and 3 investigate the sensitivity of the total cost of BAU climate change to increases in \u03b7 and \u03b4 \nfor the Review\u2019s baseline-climate and high-climate scenarios. The total cost of climate change is \nderived from a comparison of the \u2018balanced growth equivalent\u2019 or BGE of consumption without climate \nchange to the BGE of consumption after climate damage and adaptation costs have been deducted \n(Stern, 2006, p183). The BGE difference summarises modelled losses over time, regions of the world \nand possible states of the world in terms of a one-off, permanent loss of global mean per-capita \nconsumption today. \n \nWe test values of \u03b4 in the range 0.1% to 1.5% per annum. 0.1% is the value taken in the Review and \nfollows from a \u2018prescriptive\u2019 approach. 1.5% per annum corresponds to a relatively rigorous, \n\u2018descriptive\u2019 estimate of the pure rate of time preference that would follow from the preferences of \nthose currently alive (Pearce and Ulph, 1999). For \u03b7, we take 1 to 3. The Review applied a value of 1 \n(giving the special case log utility function), which is quite well supported by some recent empirical \nevidence (Cowell and Gardiner, 1999; Pearce and Ulph, 1999). However, the combination of \u03b4=0.1% \nwith \u03b7=1 does place a lot of weight on impacts in the far-off future. This is of particular concern, since \nthe Review\u2019s BGE method extrapolates the percentage of consumption lost due to climate change in \n2200 on to infinity. As a result, the share of total discounted utility over all time falling after 2200, \nbeyond the PAGE modelling horizon, is large when \u03b7=1 and \u03b4=0.1%. \n \nTABLES 2 AND 3 HERE \n \nComparing both tables, we can see that increases in the pure time discount rate significantly reduce \nestimates of the total cost of climate change, as critiques of the Review have noted (esp. Nordhaus, \n2006). Increasing \u03b4 reduces the importance of future climate-change costs in present-day decisions. In \nthe baseline-climate scenario, for example, increasing \u03b4 from 0.1% p.a. to 1.5% p.a. reduces the mean \n 17\ntotal cost of BAU climate change from 11.1% to 3.3%, where \u03b7 is 1. In the equivalent column for the \nhigh-climate scenario, the mean estimate falls from 14.7% to 4.2%. \n \nIncreasing \u03b7 has more complex effects, because it increases both the rate of intertemporal inequality \naversion (in effect it increases the consumption discount rate) and risk aversion. The former is true, \nbecause we saw above that consumption is always increasing through time, so increases in \u03b7 only serve \nto increase the consumption discount rate (if consumption growth were locally negative, an increase in \n\u03b7 would reduce the consumption discount rate). In the baseline-climate scenario, increasing \u03b7 from 1 to \n3 reduces the mean total cost of BAU climate change from 11.1% to 1.3%, where \u03b4 is 0.1% p.a. In the \nhigh-climate scenario, initial increases in \u03b7 from 1 to 2 reduce the mean total cost of climate change \n(from 14.7% to 7.4% where \u03b4 is 0.1% p.a.). But further increases in \u03b7 from 2 to 3 actually drive the \nequivalent estimates back upwards again, from 7.4% to 13.2%. This means that, while in most instances \nincreases in \u03b7 have a greater positive effect on intertemporal inequality aversion than they do on risk \naversion, the opposite is true when upper-bound values of \u03b7 are applied to the high-climate scenario. \nThis is intuitive, since the high-climate scenario realises the highest global temperatures, which work \nthrough to produce the highest damage and the lowest consumption. We are assumed to be highly \naverse to scenarios that produce very low consumption when \u03b7 lies in the range 2.5-3. Compare the \nmean total cost of climate change with the corresponding 5-95% confidence interval. When \u03b7 lies in the \nrange 2.5-3, the mean lies below even the 95th percentile, because consumption is very low in scenarios \nthat are less than 5% likely, and this feeds through to extremely low utility. Such a result is important, \nbecause it illustrates that arguments cast in terms of \u2018the\u2019 discount rate may be mistaken. In particular, \nfollowing expected-utility analysis, it shows that the effect of an increase in \u03b7 is a priori ambiguous and \ndoes not always simply work to reduce the present-value of climate damage. \n \nIn section two, we speculated that insufficient treatment of uncertainty could cause misleading results. \nWe can test this proposition on the Review estimates by using PAGE2002 to simulate a range of \nmodelling strategies, each of which takes risk into account to a different degree. Table 4 presents \nestimates from four modelling approaches. \n \n1. \u2018All modes\u2019. The first is to set all stochastic parameters in PAGE2002 to their mode values. \nThis simulates a modelling strategy in which best guesses are made about the value of all \nparameters, \u2018best\u2019 in the sense of being most likely.  \n2. \u2018All means\u2019. The second is to set all stochastic parameters in PAGE2002 to their mean values. \nThis also simulates a deterministic strategy, but the mean of the joint probability distribution of \nclimate-change costs will differ from the mode, if the distribution is asymmetric. Indeed, it is \n 18\ngenerally acknowledged to have a \u2018fat left tail\u2019 of severe impacts with a low probability, so the \nmean cost should be higher. \n3. \u2018Expected consumption\u2019. The third utilises the standard stochastic specification of PAGE2002, \nbut instead of carrying out full expected-utility analysis, we calculate the utility of expected \nconsumption. \n4. \u2018Expected utility\u2019. The fourth solves for the BGE equivalent to the expected utility of \nconsumption. \n \nTABLE 4 HERE \n \nFrom table 4 it is clear that a modelling strategy based on taking mode values for all parameters \u2013 \nequivalent to a best-guess strategy \u2013 leads to a significant underestimate of the total discounted cost of \nclimate change, relative to an expected-utility approach. In the baseline-climate scenario, this strategy \nyields an estimate of the BGE loss that is 3.5% of present global mean consumption per capita, relative \nto a mean of 11.1% when expected-utility analysis is applied. In the high-climate scenario, the \u2018all \nmodes\u2019 strategy performs even worse, estimating a 4.6% BGE loss, compared to 14.7% using expected-\nutility analysis. Moving to an \u2018all means\u2019 strategy reduces the shortfall significantly, although it is still \n3.1 percentage points below at 8% in the baseline-climate scenario. Similarly, it is 3.7 percentage points \nbelow at 11% in the high-climate scenario. \n \nCalculating the utility of expected consumption brings the estimates much closer. In the baseline-\nclimate scenario, it is 10.4%, which is just 0.7 percentage points below the expected-utility estimate. \nHowever, the expected-consumption strategy does perform worse in the high-climate scenario, falling \nshort by 2 percentage points. As before, the higher temperatures estimated by the high-climate scenario \nproduce a slightly higher likelihood of scenarios in which the impacts of climate change are very severe \nindeed. Even with relatively modest risk aversion (recall that here \u03b7=1), the need to value these risks \nsystematically is clear. \n \nThis last point indicates that the analysis can be usefully extended to consider how the expected-\nconsumption strategy performs relative to the expected-utility strategy for higher values of \u03b7. This \nenables further investigation of how the estimation of dangerous climate change, by our definition, is \naffected by modelling impacts on consumption on the one hand, and valuing consumption in utility \nterms on the other. Table 5 presents the analysis for \u03b7=1, 2 and 3. In the baseline-climate scenario, \nincreases in \u03b7 reduce the absolute shortfall between the expected-consumption estimate and the \nexpected-utility estimate, from 0.7 percentage points where \u03b7 is 1 to 0.2 percentage points where \u03b7 is 3. \n 19\nHowever, the relative shortfall is in fact rising, from 6.3% as a share of the expected-utility estimate \nwhere \u03b7 is 1, to 15.4% where \u03b7 is 3. This result is much magnified in the high-climate scenario. When \u03b7 \nis 1, the shortfall caused by taking an expected-consumption approach is 2 percentage points or 13.6%. \nBut when \u03b7 is 3, the shortfall is 11.9 percentage points, or 90.2% of the expected-utility estimate. If we \ndo believe that this is the appropriate consumption elasticity of utility in a simple framework, then the \nlast result demonstrates that even an expected-consumption approach, which at least rests on stochastic \nmodelling, understates the risks we face, possibly by a large amount. It also demonstrates the role of \nwelfare valuation in the overall monetisation of dangerous climate change. \n \nTABLE 5 HERE \n \nTo summarise at this stage, tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the proposition that insufficient treatment of \nuncertainty leads to estimates of the cost of BAU climate change that are misleadingly small. Similar \nresults have been produced by past studies, although they have not focused on the issue in such detail.9 \nFurthermore, the difference between a comprehensive, expected-utility approach and simpler \napproaches is often large. Broadly, the differences revealed are of the same magnitude as those \nproduced by different assumptions about discounting. Moving from an \u2018all modes\u2019 modelling strategy \nto expected-utility analysis increases the mean total cost of BAU climate change by 7.6 percentage \npoints in the baseline-climate scenario. Increasing the pure rate of time preference from 0.1% p.a. to \n1.5% p.a. produces a 7.8 percentage point rise in that same scenario. \n \nRecent scientific evidence increases the imperative to adopt an expected-utility approach, since it has \nraised the possibility of very large impacts and as a result has effectively increased the confidence \ninterval around the future consequences of climate change. The bigger differences between modelling \nstrategies in the high-climate scenario reflect this, insofar as the high-climate scenario takes on board \nthe possibility of dangerous positive natural feedbacks in the warming process. \n \nWe now examine sensitivity to the damage function exponent \u03b3. In addition, we analyse how \nuncertainty about the damage function exponent interacts with different degrees of risk aversion. This is \nlikely to be an important interaction, since higher values of \u03b3 \u2013 more convexity in the damage function \u2013 \nincrease the likelihood of very severe impacts. The discussion above demonstrates the significance of \nthe welfare valuation of such risks. That is, dangerous climate change in a welfare-economic sense is as \nmuch about the welfare valuation of impacts as it is about their initial estimation. \n \n                                               \n9\n e.g. Azar and Lindgren (2003), Tol (1999). \n 20\nIn table 6, we treat \u03b3 as deterministic and estimate BGE losses for a range from 1 to 3, at the same time \nexamining how that range interacts with a range of \u03b7 \u2013 the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, \ndescribing inequality and risk aversion \u2013 from 1 to 3. The analysis is confined to the baseline-climate \nscenario and holds \u03b4 constant at 0.1% p.a. \n \nTABLE 6 HERE \n \nWhere the consumption elasticity of marginal utility, \u03b7, equals 1, increasing \u03b3 from 1 to 2 raises the \nmean total cost of climate change from 5.4% of present global mean consumption per capita to 10.4%, \nan increase of 92% in relative terms. A power of 2 produces an estimate closest to the Stern Review\u2019s \nmain result, reported in table 2. Thus where \u03b7=1, our summary estimate of the total cost of climate \nchange is indeed very sensitive to the damage function exponent, as the Postscript to the Review also \nsuggested. However, where \u03b7=3, the mean total cost of climate change increases from 0.9% to just \n1.1% for \u03b3=2, a rise of just 0.2 percentage points or around 22% in relative terms. We would indeed \nhave expected all estimates to fall, since raising the consumption elasticity of marginal utility increases \nintertemporal inequality aversion and thus the consumption discount rate under rising consumption. But \nthe relative effect of changes in the damage function exponent has also fallen. This indicates that \nincreases in \u03b7 work to a greater extent to increase intertemporal inequality aversion than they do to \nincrease risk aversion, for this relatively modest range of damage function exponents. \n \nHowever, increasing \u03b3 beyond 2 paints a different picture for our overall evaluation. The mean total cost \nof climate change increases to 33.3% where \u03b3=3 and \u03b7=1. Moreover, as risk aversion increases, the \nrange of estimates increases too. Where \u03b7=3, the total cost estimate jumps to 51.9%, as \u03b3 increases to 3. \nComparing the mean cost with the 90% confidence interval shows that, where \u03b3=3 and \u03b7=3, the mean \nlies far beyond the 95th percentile estimate. So if we ascribe high values to \u03b7, perhaps based on \nempirical evidence on risk aversion, then assumptions about the convexity of damage become all the \nmore important. A very few Monte Carlo draws are driving the welfare valuation in this case, because \nwe are deemed to be highly averse to running the risk of these outcomes being realised. \n \nWe move on in table 7 to investigate sensitivity to the PAGE model\u2019s third pathway to \u2018dangerous\u2019 \nclimate change, the risk of a macro-discontinuity with direct economic impacts. We treat each of the \nthree parameters in equation (3) as deterministic and estimate BGE losses for their minimum, mode and \nmaximum values, once again in interaction with different assumptions about \u03b7. To recap, the three \nparameters are \u03b6, the loss in GDP if a macro-discontinuity occurs (minimum 5%, mode 10%, maximum \n20%), \u03b8, the probability of a macro-discontinuity (minimum 1 percentage point per \u00baC rise in global \n 21\nmean temperature, mode 10 ppts., maximum 20 ppts.), and TTRIGGER, the threshold global mean \ntemperature, above which a macro-discontinuity becomes possible (minimum 2\u00baC, mode 5\u00baC, \nmaximum 8\u00baC). The analysis is for the baseline-climate scenario, with \u03b4=0.1% p.a. and \u03b3 stochastic. \n \nTABLE 7 HERE \n \nTable 7 demonstrates that cost estimates are also sensitive to variations in the three parameters, which \njointly determine the risk of a macro-discontinuity with direct impacts. Looking first at \u03b6, the loss in \nGDP if a macro-discontinuity occurs, increasing that loss from 5% to 20% increases the present value \nof the mean total cost of climate change from 7.9% to 12.9%, in our central case where \u03b7=1. If we now \nexamine the results of interacting increases in \u03b6 with increases in \u03b7, we see an interesting \u2018tipping point\u2019 \nof the kind identified in table 3 and in examining the sensitivity of estimates to very high values of \u03b3. \nWhere \u03b6 is in the range 5% to 10%, increases in \u03b7 from 1 to 3 straightforwardly reduce the mean total \ncost of climate change. As before, the reason is that intertemporal inequality aversion dominates risk \naversion. However, when \u03b6 is 20% and \u03b7 is 3, the mean total cost estimate rebounds markedly, to \n39.5%. As before, comparing the mean to the 90% confidence interval indicates that a very small share \nof Monte Carlo draws, less than 5% likely, must drive this result. Estimates are similarly sensitive to \nvariations in \u03b8 and TTRIGGER , but with the important difference that there is no such tipping point in \nthese cases. \n \nFinally, we return to the issue of utility or pure time discounting, because much of the preceding \nanalysis has been based on near-zero time preference (\u03b4=0.1% p.a.). In table 8, we briefly recapitulate \nthe previous sensitivity analysis with a utility discount rate of 1.5% per annum. We do so by \nreanalysing the maximum differences in our estimates of the mean total cost of climate change from \ntables 4, 6 and 7. Thus we first present the difference in BGE losses under the high-climate scenario for \nan \u2018all modes\u2019 modelling strategy, compared with expected-utility analysis, where \u03b7=1. This illuminates \nthe effect of modelling and valuing uncertainty under higher pure time discounting. Second, we present \nthe difference in BGE losses between damage function exponents, \u03b3, of 1 and 3, where \u03b7=3. Finally, we \npresent the differences brought about by losses in GDP if a macro-discontinuity occurs, \u03b6, of 5% and \n20%, again where \u03b7=3. \n \nTABLE 8 HERE \n \nAs we would expect, BGE losses are in all cases lower than their equivalents in tables 4, 6 and 7, \nbecause an increase in the utility discount rate reduces the present value of climate damages and \n 22\nadaptation costs falling in the future, especially in the medium and long run. Similarly, the differences \nbetween the estimates are smaller in absolute terms. Thus moving from a modelling strategy based on \ntaking mode values for all parameters to a strategy based on expected-utility analysis increases the \nmean total cost of climate change by just 2.8 percentage points, from 1.4% to 4.2%. This compares with \nan equivalent 10.1 percentage point increase where \u03b4=0.1% p.a., from 4.6% to 14.7% (see table 4). \nSimilarly, increasing \u03b3 from 1 to 3 brings about an absolute increase in the BGE loss of 12.7 percentage \npoints, from 0.4% to 13.1%. This compares to an equivalent increase of 51 percentage points where \n\u03b4=0.1% p.a., from 0.9% to 51.9% (table 6). And increasing \u03b6 from 5% of GDP to 20% of GDP results \nin an absolute increase in the BGE loss of 7.3 percentage points, from 0.5% to 7.8%. Compare this with \na 38.5 percentage point increase where \u03b4=0.1% p.a., from 1.0% to 39.5% (table 7). \n \nWhile in the case of modelling strategies the relative differences are very similar (around a 200% \nincrease on the lower estimate), in terms of \u03b3 and \u03b6 they are much reduced by raising the utility discount \nrate. As \u03b3 rises from 1 to 3, the BGE loss increases by over 3000% relative to the estimate where \u03b3=1. \nWhile evidently an enormous relative change, brought about by high aversion (\u03b7=3) to the small risk of \nsevere climate impacts (less than 5% of Monte Carlo draws), the equivalent relative change calculable \nfrom table 6 is around 5700%. The explanation lies in the relationship between time and the convexity \nof climate-change impacts. The Monte Carlo draws that drive these welfare estimates where \u03b7 is 3 do \nnot deliver their severe impacts until after 2100, by which time higher utility discounting has muted \ntheir effect on welfare valuation. Much the same is true of an increase in \u03b6, where the relative \ndifferences are around 1500% and 4000% relative to the lower estimate respectively. Nevertheless, in \nclosing it is worth emphasising that, in the extreme high cases reported in table 8, the present value of \nthe total cost of climate change is still large in absolute terms, even with a higher utility discount rate. \nWhile it is beyond the scope of this paper to perform optimisation, it is fairly safe to say that a present-\nvalue cost of 13.1% (where \u03b7=3 and \u03b3=3) is large enough to warrant stabilisation of atmospheric GHG \nconcentrations at a low level.  \n \n5. Discussion \n \nBy some accounts, the overriding reason why the Stern Review estimates of climate damage are high is \na low discount rate (e.g. Dasgupta, 2006; Nordhaus, 2006). This is certainly true to some extent, \nbecause a high utility discount rate \u2013 one component of the consumption discount rate \u2013 renders the \npresent value of climate damage in the far-off future so low that it becomes almost always largely \nirrelevant how big that damage is. But if we accept a low utility discount rate, then present-value \nestimates become heavily dependent on how risk and uncertainty are taken into account and valued, \n 23\nallied to assumptions about the likelihood of dangerous climate change. The Stern Review\u2019s IAM and \nwelfare valuation includes a wide range of risks and values them systematically on the basis of \nexpected-utility analysis. It also includes three pathways through which dangerous climate change, in \nthe sense of rapid and large-scale losses in global consumption, can materialise. First, it allows for \nrapidly escalating costs of gradual climate change in its specification of the damage function exponent. \nSecond, it allows for abrupt, large-scale and discontinuous positive natural feedbacks in the climate \nsystem through its high-climate scenario. Third, it includes a fairly novel but speculative function for \nthe direct impacts of abrupt, large-scale and discontinuous climatic changes. We have argued that an \nIAM, which includes the possibility of dangerous climate change, is consistent \u2013 if not in a strict sense \n\u2013 with an approach that assumes some natural capital is \u2018critical\u2019.  \n \nWe have set out how the Stern Review incorporates the economics of risk and demonstrated that doing \nso makes a big difference to damage estimates. But climate change is at best a problem characterised by \nKnightian uncertainty. That is to say, modellers are essentially undertaking a monumental exercise in \nassigning subjective probabilities \u2013 in Bayesian decision theory. At worst, climate change would better \nbe characterised as a problem of ignorance. For example, IAMs currently make no explicit estimates of \nthe damages resulting from \u2018socially contingent\u2019 impacts (Downing et al., 2005). Thus IAMs are \nignorant of these scenarios. Similarly, warming in the Review\u2019s high-climate scenario still lies well \nwithin the extremes reported in Meinshausen\u2019s (2006) synthesis of eleven studies. In fact, the Review \ntouched briefly on the problems that arise when one cannot define a continuous probability distribution \nover all outcomes. This is evident in the conundrum of how to weigh up the consequences of the \nReview\u2019s baseline- and high-climate scenarios, because we have no quantification of their relative \nlikelihoods. Thus the Review relies on an informal, qualitative application of precaution. Then there is \nthe question of ambiguity or fuzziness in the interpretation of probabilities (e.g. Stirling, 1998): the \nnotion that, even if we could constrain our estimates of the consequences of climate change in terms of, \nsay, global mean temperature, it is not clear how to interpret these consequences, because weighing up \neconomic, social and environmental impacts is a question of value. CBA makes a particular value \njudgement and naturally there are rival ethical approaches, such as those based on rights, that are given \nextremely short thrift in the process. Thus, for all these reasons, a broad range of evidence is required to \nsupport recommendations on climate-change mitigation. Ironically, the Stern Review was acutely aware \nof this (Stern, 2006, chapter 2). To a large extent, critics of the Review miss the point that arguments for \nstabilisation were based first and foremost on a disaggregated analysis of climate impacts (chapters 3-\n5). \n \n 24\nSo what is the worth of formal economic modelling? It certainly does not lie in providing precise \nestimates of climate damage and a precise optimal pathway for GHG emission reductions. This is most \nespecially true of CBA studies that altogether avoid including impacts, about which measurement and \nvaluation is currently most difficult and uncertain (esp. Mendelsohn et al., e.g. 1999). Rather it lies in \nobtaining an order-of-magnitude quantification of the economic consequences of unabated climate \nchange. And it certainly helps to make the consequences of key value judgements on time preference \nand risk and inequality aversion systematically clear. \u03b4 and \u03b7 are not just economic technicalities, as \nsome have insinuated. All approaches make implicit judgements embodied in these parameters. It is to \nthe great credit of the CBA approach that such assumptions are made explicit and their consequences \ntested rigorously. As such we could think of IAMs as a canvas on which debates about intergenerational \nfairness, the distribution of wealth, and the management of risk and uncertainty, are \u2018painted\u2019.  \n \nReferences \n \nAzar, C.
