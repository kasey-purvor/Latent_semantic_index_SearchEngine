Boron ions from 10 to 80 keV were implanted in s100d Si at ambient\ntemperature, to a constant fluence of 131015 ions\/cm2. After irradiation the samples were annealed\nfor 20 min at 950 \u00b0C by rapid thermal annealing. The samples were analyzed by transmission\nelectron microscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. It was found that the applied ion\nimplantation\/thermal processing induces interstitial perfect and faulted dislocation loops in h111j\nhabit planes, with Burgers vectors a \/2k110l and a \/3k111l, respectively. The loops are located\naround the projected ion range, but stretch in depth approximately to the end of range. Their size and\ndistribution depend strongly on the applied ion energy. In the 10 keV boron-implanted samples the\nloops are shallow, with a mean size of ,30 nm for faulted loops and ,75 nm for perfect loops.\nHigher energies yield buried, large, and irregularly shaped perfect loops, up to ,500 nm, coexisting\nwith much smaller faulted loops. In the latter case much more Si interstitials are bounded by the\nloops, which are assigned to a higher supersaturation of interstitials in as-implanted samples, due to\nseparated Frenkel pairs. An interesting phenomenon was found: the perfect loops achieved a\nsteady-state maximum size when the ion energy reached 40 keV. Further increase of the ion energy\nonly increased the number of these large loops and made them bury deeper in the substrate.

INTRODUCTION\nAchieving efficient light emission from silicon is a chal-\nlenge for future progress in ultralarge-scale integration\nsULSId technology, where optical interconnects will be an\nultimate solution as the devices become smaller and faster.\nNumerous methods were investigated to produce light emit-\nters from silicon and silicon-based materials, the disadvan-\ntage of pure silicon being in its inefficient light emission due\nto the indirect nature of the electronic band gap. One of\nearlier approaches demonstrated a light-emitting diode\nsLEDd that contained precipitates of b FeSi2 embedded in\nsilicon,1 the silicide itself being a direct band-gap\nsemiconductor.2,3 However, despite being efficient at low\ntemperatures the emission due to b FeSi2 quenched to low\nvalues at room temperature. Recent efforts yielded a discov-\nery of an all-silicon LED, produced by dislocation engineer-\ning, which involves ion implantation and subsequent heat\ntreatments.4 The essence of this recent method is a controlled\nintroduction of dislocation loops which create a strain field\nthat modifies the silicon band gap, thus preventing nonradi-\native and enhancing radiative transitions of electrical carri-\ners. Indeed, light-emitting diodes efficient at room tempera-\nture were fabricated by implantation of boron into silicon,\nwhere the role of boron was both as a dopant to form a\np-n junction, as well as a means to introduce dislocation\nloops.4\u20136\nDislocation loops and other linear defects were studied\nintensively as a residual damage after ion implantation dop-\ning of silicon. In those studies they were treated as unwanted\neffects, causing enhanced diffusion of dopants and\/or failure\nof fabricated devices. Special attention was given to\ntransient-enhanced diffusion sTEDd of dopants, which hap-\npens during the initial stages of postimplantation annealing,\nand it was correlated to the evolution of linear and planar\ndefects during annealing at different temperatures and\ntimes.7\u201311 Systematic studies12\u201320 of nucleation, growth, and\ntransformation of these defects, performed with the aim to\nunderstand and possibly minimize or eliminate their effects,\nare now useful if they are to be produced deliberately. As ion\nimplantation increases local density, the induced defects are\nextrinsic in nature, and the dislocation loops that are formed\nare interstitial.

Crystal damages nominated as category I\nand II in this classification are most interesting for a con-\ntrolled formation of dislocation loops. In the first case no\namorphous layer is formed in Si during ion implantation, but\nthe necessary fluence for defects to appear is above a critical\nvalue of ,231014 ions\/cm2, irrelevant of the ion species.14\nDefects formed during annealing at 700\u20131000 \u00b0C consist\nmainly of h113j rodlike defects, faulted Frank dislocation\nloops, and perfect dislocation loops located around the pro-\njected ion range in Si. Both faulted and perfect dislocation\nloops are interstitial, having h111j habit planes, and Burgers\nvectors a \/3k111l and a \/2k110l, respectively.12\u201314 The major-\nity of studies reported in the literature are concerned with\ncategory II damage, when ion implantation forms an amor-\nphous layer in silicon. Preamorphization of silicon sprior to\nimplantation of borond was carried out with heavier ions,\nsuch as Si or Ga.10,11 The defects that form during annealing\nare so called \u201cend of range\u201d sEORd defects because they\noriginate from the initial amorphous\/crystalline interface. For\nsimilar heat treatments they consist also of rodlike defects\nand faulted and perfect dislocation loops, but they are lo-\ncated deeper in the substrate than category I defects, and the\ndislocation loops are considerably smaller.\nIn this paper we present a study of the nature and distri-\nbution of dislocation loops in silicon LED structures fabri-\ncated by boron ion implantation in the energy range from\n10 to 80 keV. After implantation the Si samples were an-\nnealed at 950 \u00b0C for 20 min, the conditions that have been\nfound to induce dislocation loop structures that provide effi-\ncient light emission at room temperature.5,6,21 The main\nanalysis of the samples was performed by transmission elec-\ntron microscopy sTEMd, and we also used Rutherford back-\nscattering spectroscopy sRBSd to study the damage distribu-\ntion in silicon. As there was no amorphizaton of the Si\nsubstrates by ion irradiation, the induced defects belong to\ncategory I damage, and consist of perfect and faulted dislo-\ncation loops. The loops are located around the projected ion\nrange, though they stretch in depth approximately to the end\nof ion range.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe base material used for these experiments and for\nfabrication of light-emitting diodes were 4-in. n-type s100d\nsilicon wafers sphosphorous doped, 2\u20137 V cmd. They were\nimplanted with boron ions, using a Danfysik ion implanter.\nThe ion energy was varied in the range from 10 to 80 keV,\nin steps of 10 keV, while the implanted fluence was kept\nconstant at 131015 ions\/cm2. The corresponding projected\nion range Rp varied from 39 nm for 10 keV to 275 nm for\n80 keV, as deduced by the TRIM code.22 During implanta-\ntion the wafers were mounted on a carousel holder held at\nambient temperature, and the beam current was held below\n1 mA\/cm2 to avoid beam heating of the targets. After ion\nimplantation all the samples were annealed under the same\nconditions, in a nitrogen ambient for 20 min at 950 \u00b0C, by\nrapid thermal annealing sRTAd. Fabrication of light-emitting\ndiodes was then completed by deposition of front and back\ncontacts, as described previously.4\u20136\nFor TEM analysis we prepared both cross-sectional\nsXTEMd and plan-view specimens of all the samples, using\nlow-angle argon ion-beam thinning at 5 keV. The analysis\nwas done on Philips EM 400 T and CM 200 electron micro-\nscopes, operated at 120 and 200 kV, respectively. Since our\nsamples contained both perfect and faulted dislocation loops\nwith Burgers vectors a \/2k110l and a \/3k111l, in order to\nobserve all of them in plan-view specimens we used an off-\naxis four-beam imaging condition, which gives better con-\ntrast than the symmetrical on-axis f001g imaging condition,\nas proposed by Pan et al.17,18 For determining the Burgers\nvectors of dislocation loops, we used h220j and h004j two-\nbeam conditions. Standard trace analysis techniques have\nbeen used to determine the habit plane and the intrinsic\/\nextrinsic nature of the loops.23 In XTEM samples we used\nthe f110g zone axis to image the loops. RBS analysis was\ndone with a 1.5-MeV He+ beam and two detectors positioned\nat 147\u00b0 and 166\u00b0 backscattering angles. Channeling tech-\nnique was used to study the damage, the yield being com-\npared to virgin silicon.\nIII. RESULTS\nThe results of the TEM analysis have revealed that after\nboron implantation and the applied annealing, 20 min at\n950 \u00b0C, all the samples contain only extrinsic dislocation\nloops. Other possible linear defects were dissolved at these\nannealing conditions. The dislocation loops have h111j habit\nplanes and are either perfect or faulted. Their depth distribu-\ntion, shape, and size depend strongly on the applied ion en-\nergy.\nA series of bright-field XTEM images taken from the\nsamples implanted with boron at energies ranging from\n10 to 80 keV is presented in Fig. 1. All images were taken\nalong the f110g Si zone axis. We can see oval shapes due to\nFIG. 1. Bright-field XTEM images taken along f110g Si of the samples\nimplanted with boron at 10\u201380 keV.\n073512-2 Milosavljevi\u00e6 et al. J. Appl.

As the ion energy is increased, the loops enlarge in size\nand are buried deeper in the Si substrate. In Fig. 2 we have\nplotted the measured values of h, the middle position of the\nloops, and D, the maximum depth of the loops from the\nsurface sindicated in Fig. 1d as a function of ion energy, as\nwell as the values of Rp obtained from TRIM. It is seen that,\nwithin the experimental error, the loops are located around\nthe projected ion range, but as they are relatively large in\nsize, their inner edges spread much deeper.\nPlan-view images of selected samples are presented in\nFig. 3. They were taken under the off-axis four-beam imag-\ning condition when the pole of the f001g pattern is tilted to\noverlap with the h020j beam, allowing all loops to be ob-\nserved with good contrast. The samples were thinned from\nthe back, and we chose thicker areas for analysis, where the\nloops were not partly cut off by thinning. The plan-view\nimages illustrate how the loops develop with increasing the\nion energy. In the 10 keV implanted sample the loops appear\nthe smallest, with a mean size of ,30 nm for faulted loops\nand ,75 nm for perfect loops, although some perfect loops\ngrow up to ,200 nm. For higher implantation energies per-\nfect loops grow much larger. Examples of perfect and faulted\ndislocation loops are indicated by markers in Fig. 3. For the\nion energy of 40 keV the maximum size of perfect disloca-\ntion loops tends to saturate at ,500 nm, and for higher en-\nergies only the number of these large loops increases. Apart\nfrom large perfect loops, in high-energy implanted samples\nwe still observe much smaller faulted loops. In the studies of\nEOR loops in preamorphized silicon, perfect dislocation\nloops were also referred to as \u201cprismatic,\u201d as they are usually\nelongated along the k110l directions, or can have rectangular\nshapes with edges parallel to these directions.18,24 However,\nthe EOR loops are much smaller stypically a few tens of\nnanometers, both perfect and faultedd than the loops that we\nhave produced. In our case we also observe some prismati-\ncally shaped loops, as shown for the sample implanted at\n30 keV, but generally they are irregularly shaped. This ap-\npearance is probably due to a form of ripening, when perfect\nloops join with other such loops that have started to grow in\nother directions.\nIn Fig. 4 we illustrate the analysis of a sample implanted\nat 40 keV, showing how dislocation loops can be distin-\nguished among themselves and their Burgers vectors deter-\nmined. We used the b \u00b7g=0 rule with two-beam imaging con-\nditions typical for studying diffraction contrast, where b is\nthe Burgers vector of the loops and g a vector in the recip-\nrocal space, normal to the reflecting plane in the real space.\nUnder such orientation of the sample, the images of the loops\nthat satisfy this condition disappear, or they only show a\nweak residual contrast. For the off-axis four-beam condition\nused in Fig. 4sad, all dislocation loops can be seen. In this\ncase the diffraction pattern consists of the transmitted beam,\ntwo adjacent h220j reflections, and one h004j reflection diag-\nonal to the transmitted beam. However, for two-beam condi-\ntions, using h220j reflections as in Figs. 4sbd and 4scd, some\nof the loops disappear. These are faulted Frank loops with\nFIG. 2. Dependence of the middle position of the loops h, maximum depth\nof the loops from the surface D and of the ion range Rp upon implantation\nenergy.\nFIG. 3.

From a similar analysis, using\nh004j reflections, we have determined the Burgers vector of\nthe larger perfect loops as a \/2k110l.\nBy trace analysis snot presented hered we have deter-\nmined that both types of loops are interstitial and that their\nhabit planes are h111j. Direct evidence is presented by a\nhigh-resolution XTEM image in Fig. 5, taken along f110g\nfrom a sample implanted at 20 keV. The image shows cross\nsections of two neighboring dislocation loops, lying in two\ndifferent h111j planes parallel to the e-beam. The shorter\nloop sfd is seen as a whole, while from the longer loop spd we\nonly see one end, as it stretches much further to the left of\nthe view field. Both loops induce stress in the surrounding Si\nlattice, which is seen as an increased darkness that spreads\nlaterally, parallel to the loops. Using our operating condition\nsScherzer defocusedd, the rows of white spots in the image\noriginate from empty spaces in the crystal lattice, and they\nare blocked where the loops are positioned. Also, the smaller\nloop is a faulted Frank dislocation loop as it exhibits a stack-\ning fault sequence, and the longer one is a perfect dislocation\nloop.\nDamage distribution in the as-implanted samples and\ndepth distribution of dislocation loops in the annealed\nsamples were analyzed by RBS. In Fig. 6 we present the\nRBS channeling spectra of the as-implanted and annealed\nsamples, after boron irradiation to 131015 ions\/cm2, at 20\nand 80 keV. The channeling was done in the f001g Si direc-\ntion, and for comparison we included a channeled spectrum\nof virgin Si. In the as-implanted samples we can see an in-\ncreased yield compared to virgin Si, located immediately be-\nhind the surface Si peak. This comes from radiation damage,\ni.e., mainly from Si atoms that are displaced from their lat-\ntice positions in collision cascades induced by the impact\nions. The damage spreads much deeper in the sample im-\nplanted at higher energy, and at the end of the damaged re-\ngion the backscattering yield drops practically to the level for\nvirgin Si. The spectra taken from the annealed samples are\ndifferent, and if we compare to the XTEM analysis in Fig. 1,\nwe can find similarities. The surface region of the samples\nhas recrystallized and hence the RBS yield is at the channel-\ning level of single-crystal Si. Gradual increase of RBS yield\nwith respect to virgin Si begins at a depth where the dislo-\ncation loops start to appear, and advances to their inner edge\nin the Si substrate. Finally, the yield from the deeper region\nof Si does not drop as in the case of the as-implanted\nsamples, but the analyzing beam remains partly dechanneled\nby dislocation loops. Thus, from the RBS spectra it was pos-\nsible to determine the depth and the thickness of the layer\nthat contains dislocation loops. The mean depth values of the\nloops that were calculated from the RBS spectra are in good\nagreement with those obtained from the TEM analysis sFig.\n2d and are close to the Rp values obtained by TRIM.\nFrom the plan-view TEM analysis we have determined\nthe density of dislocation loops and the number of trapped Si\ninterstitials as a function of boron implantation energy. The\ntotal analyzed area of each sample was 434 mm2, which\ncontained up to ,1000 loops for the highest population. A\nplot of the loop density stotal density of loops and density of\nfaulted loopsd is shown in Fig. 7. It is seen that the loop\ndensity drops with increasing ion energy, but this does not\nFIG. 5.

Two stages\nare present in these plots, one from 10 to 40 keV and a sec-\nond from 40 to 80 keV. The borderline at 40 keV coincides\nwith the stage when perfect dislocation loops saturate in size\nand the large loops only increase in number. This supports\nthe argument that for higher ion energies, when more inter-\nstitials are generated in the Si substrate, initially isolated per-\nfect loops tend to coalesce in larger loops. The density of\nfaulted loops also decreases because more Si interstitials are\ntrapped in the perfect loops. The number of Si atoms trapped\nby the loops increases as a function of ion energy, as plotted\nin Fig. 8sad. To calculate this we have used the mean size of\nthe loops and their density, and the atomic density of Si in\nh111j planes s1.5731015 at. \/cm2d. An estimated error here is\nabout 20% due to approximating the loops to a circular\nshape, and this adds up to the error in determining the loop\ndensity. Nevertheless, a similar trend was found for the num-\nber of displaced Si atoms in the as-implanted samples from\nthe RBS analysis, which is plotted in Fig. 8sbd. The number\nof displaced Si atoms was determined with respect to the\nrandom level, first by normalizing and subtracting the virgin\nSi spectrum from the channeled spectra of the as-implanted\nsamples and integrating the obtained damage peak.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe engineered dislocation loops belong to category I\ndefects, as the damage induced in silicon by ion implantation\nis far below the amorphous level, but the applied fluence was\nsufficient to produce the necessary amount of interstitials to\nform dislocation loops upon annealing. It was found that the\nnumber of displaced silicon atoms in the as-implanted\nsamples is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the num-\nber of atoms trapped in dislocation loops in the annealed\nsamples sFig. 8d. During postimplantation annealing the ma-\njority of implantation-induced interstitials and vacancies re-\ncombine, and only about 2% of interstitials are left over to\ncontribute to extrinsic dislocation loops. Monte Carlo simu-\nlations of ion implantation infer that vacancies are created\ncloser to the surface,20 where the implanted ions have suffi-\ncient energy to displace the host atoms from their lattice\nsites. Interstitials build up deeper in the substrate, typically in\na depth region spreading from the projected ion range Rp to\nthe end of range, where primary and secondary recoils come\nto rest. Vacancies that are created near the surface and inter-\nstitials located deeper in the substrate are so-called separated\nFrenkel pairs. Also, due to the substitutional boron dopant\nbeing implanted, there is a net increase in the number of\natoms around the projected ion range that can be incorpo-\nrated in the host lattice. During annealing some of the vacan-\ncies may diffuse to the surface, leaving an excess number of\ninterstitials buried deeper in the substrate. Furthermore, the\nelectrically activated boron preferentially occupies substitu-\ntional sites in the Si crystal lattice. Hence, there is a super-\nsaturation of Si interstitials that cannot recombine and this is\nthe reason why category I defects are extrinsic. It is still a\nquestion of argument whether the increased local concentra-\ntion due to implanted species or separated Frenkel pairs are a\ndominant source of interstitials, but it seems that both have a\ncontribution. Evolution from supersaturated interstitials to an\narray of perfect dislocation loops as a function of annealing\nhas been studied extensively. A model proposed by Tan,25\nand also described in detail by Jones et al.,14 for category I\ndefects is based on numerous observations. In brief, point\ndefects first coalesce in intermediate defect configurations,\nconsisting of small clusters s,2 nmd, rodlike defects, and\nFIG. 7.

Upon annealing at temperatures up to\n700 \u00b0C rodlike defects were found to grow,12 but at higher\ntemperatures they dissolve and extrinsic faulted dislocation\nloops begin to grow. After the rodlike defects have dissolved,\nthe remaining defects consist of faulted dislocation loops and\ndipoles. With further increase of annealing temperature,\nthese faulted loops and dipoles unfault through nucleation of\nShockley partial dislocations. Finally at temperatures from\n900 to 1000 \u00b0C all faulted loops are unfaulted, and a layer of\nperfect dislocation loops is formed.13,14\nOur samples were annealed for 20 min at 950 \u00b0C and\nwe have found a mixture of perfect and faulted dislocation\nloops. We also find that the mean size and density of the\nloops changes with the applied ion energy. Furthermore, we\nhave implanted the same boron fluence of 1\n31015 ions\/cm2, but the number of Si atoms trapped in the\ndislocation loops depends strongly on the applied ion energy.\nObviously, at higher energies more Si interstitials are pro-\nduced and correspondingly more of them become trapped in\ndislocation loops sFig. 8d. For the implantation energy of\n80 keV the number of Si interstitials bounded by the loops is\nclose to the value of the implanted ion fluence. Dislocation\nloops are buried deeper in Si with increasing ion energy,\ntheir mean depth being around the projected ion range, but\ntheir inner edge stretches much deeper in the substrate. By\ncomparing the RBS channeled spectra from the as-implanted\nand annealed samples, it is seen that the loops are located\ntowards the inner edge of the initial damaged zone. The\ndeeper edge of the loops coincides with the end of the dam-\naged zone of the as-implanted samples, as more clearly seen\nfor the sample implanted at 80 keV. This implies that the\nloops stretch approximately to the end of range of the im-\nplanted ions, and can be attributed to the contribution of\nseparated Frenkel pairs in the initial supersaturation of inter-\nstitials. The number of large irregularly shaped perfect loops\nincreases with the ion energy. Here we cannot use directly\nthe term \u201cripening,\u201d as we were not extending the annealing\ntime or increasing the temperature, but it can be said that it is\ndue to a higher starting concentration of Si interstitials. The\ninitial neighboring loops are much closer to each other and\ncan more easily coalesce to form large irregularly shaped\nloops upon further annealing. An interesting phenomenon\nfound in our studies is that for the ion energy from\n40 to 80 keV the maximum size of the loops does not\nchange. With increasing ion energy they just increase in\nnumber and are buried deeper in the substrate.\nIn Ref. 19 Cristiano et al. have calculated and plotted the\nformation energy for both faulted and perfect dislocation\nloops as a function of their size. It was shown that faulted\nloops have a lower formation energy and are therefore more\nenergetically stable up to a diameter of 80 nm, while perfect\nloops are energetically more stable for larger diameters. Our\nresults are in reasonable agreement with these calculations.\nThe mean diameter of faulted loops that we have found\nranges from ,30 nm for 10 keV to ,90 nm for 80 keV bo-\nron ion energy.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe evolution of dislocation loops in Si LED structures\nwas studied as a function of boron ion implantation energy.\nAlthough we have used the same ion fluence and the same\nthermal treatment throughout the experiments, it was demon-\nstrated how the dislocation loops can be engineered. By al-\ntering the ion energy it is possible to vary the depth, size, and\nthe density of dislocation loops.\nThe applied ion irradiation and thermal processing pro-\nduce a layer of perfect and faulted dislocation loops at a\ndepth around the projected ion range, stretching to the end of\nrange. For a low ion energy of 10 keV, the loops are shal-\nlower and smaller, with a mean size of ,30 and ,75 nm for\nfaulted and perfect loops, respectively, and have a denser\npopulation. Higher ion energies induce buried, large, and ir-\nregularly shaped perfect dislocation loops, up to ,500 nm,\ncoexisting with much smaller faulted loops. We have found\nthat the maximum size of the loops saturates for the boron\nion energy of 40 keV, and with further increase of the ion\nenergy they are only buried deeper in the Si substrate. This\nprovides a possibility to tailor a device structure by position-\ning the loops at a desired depth.\nThe results are significant for dislocation engineering of\nsilicon LEDs, in offering a possibility to design the loop\nmean size and density, and their location with respect to the\np-n junction. The method can be combined with other pro-\ncessing, such as etching, or different ion irradiation\/\nannealing parameters can be used, to further adjust the ap-\npearance and distribution of dislocation loops, and hence\ninfluence the corresponding electroluminescence efficiency\nof silicon LEDs.\n1D.
