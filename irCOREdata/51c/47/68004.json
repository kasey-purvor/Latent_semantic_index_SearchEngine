Taylor\nAugust 4, 2010\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a new model and methodology for estimating the ability of NBA\nplayers. The main idea is to directly measure how good a player is by comparing how\ntheir team performs when they are on the court as opposed to when they are off it. This\nis achieved in a such a way as to control for the changing abilities of the other players\non court at different times during a match. The new method uses multiple seasons\u2019 data\nin a structured way to estimate player ability in an isolated season, measuring separately\ndefensive and offensive merit as well as combining these to give an overall rating. The use\nof game statistics in predicting player ability will be considered. Results using data from\nthe 2008\/9 season suggest that LeBron James, who won the NBA MVP award, was the\nbest overall player. The best defensive player was Lamar Odom and the best rookie was\nRussell Westbrook, neither of whom won an NBA award that season. The results further\nindicate that whilst the frequently\u2013reported game statistics provide some information on\noffensive ability, they do not perform well in the prediction of defensive ability.\nKeywords: Defensive Ratings, Game Statistics, Offensive Ratings, Rating NBA players\n1 Introduction\nThe most basic rating systems for professional basketball players are simple (or not so simple)\nfunctions of \u2018positive\u2019 statistics such as free throw percentage and the number of steals as well\nas \u2018negative\u2019 statistics like the number of turnovers and personal fouls. One example is the\ncomputer ranking procedure used to assign the 1998 IBM player award (the function used is\ndetailed in equation 1 of Berri (1999)). Although such rating systems yield some information\non player ability, they usually offer neither a justification for the functional form, for the\n1\nchoice of player statistics used, for the \u2018value\u2019 ascribed to each statistic in calculating the\nrating nor an estimate of the precision.\nOne alternative is to model an outcome variable (like whether or not the team won) as a\nfunction of game or player statistics, for example by using a regression model. Provided the\ndata is well described according to the chosen model, standard statistical techniques may be\napplied to overcome and provide answers to the issues mentioned above. One of the earliest\npublished attempts to model professional basketball team performance was by Zak et al.\n(1979) in which a Cobb\u2013Douglas production function was used to model the ratio of final\nscores against game level statistics including those four mentioned above. Although this paper\ndid not seek to rate individual players, the authors mention that such an approach is feasible\nusing their method.\nBerri (1999) models team wins as a linear combination of player and game level statistics, the\nidea being to learn which statistics are valuable in predicting team wins. Unfortunately the\nproblem with ascribing team wins to individual performances over entire games ignores some\nimportant information, namely that at any one time there are only 10 active players.\nAlthough this issue is addressed in his paper by adjusting for the time spent by each player\non court, there is still some loss of information as only certain combinations of players meet\neach other during the game. Moreover, Berri\u2019s method though ingenious, is somewhat\nintricate and difficult to justify at a methodological level: it is still not clear why the range of\nstatistics considered should be preferred over another candidate set. The reliance on these\nstatistics means that methods such as Berri\u2019s tend to be overly complicated; it is the opinion\nof the present authors that it does not matter how a net point difference is achieved, simply\nthat it is achieved.\nThanks to modern game charting techniques and records, much more information is now\navailable to researchers (Kubatko et al., 2007). Not only are player\u2013level summary statistics\navailable, but some organisations provide time\u2013lines of important events during each game.\nWith this information, it is possible to infer which players were on pitch at any time in the\ngame, thus allowing an alternative modelling perspective. A basketball game consists of a\nsequence of time intervals in which no substitutions occur. Each of these intervals can be\nthought of as a \u2018small game\u2019 in which the players on court remain constant; the outcome of\nthe game as a whole being the sum of outcomes of the small games. By comparing how the\nresults of these small games depends on the players on the court, the relative ability of the\n2\ndifferent players can be measured. For example if player A is substituted by player B then the\nrelative ability of these two players is measured by looking at how well their team performs\nwhen player A is on the court as compared to player B.\nFormally, the new model introduced in this article measures each player\u2019s offensive and\ndefensive ability. The expected number of points per possession for a given team during a\n\u2018small game\u2019 is modelled as a linear function of the offensive ability of the 5 players of that\nteam who are on the court and in possession and the defensive ability of the 5 players on the\nopposing team, adjusting for home advantage. This approach is similar to that of Rosenbaum\n(2004) and Ilardi and Barzilai (2008). The main difference compared with Rosenbaum (2004)\nis that the author estimates only a combined ability for each player. The model presented\nhere further uses a structured approach to combining information from multiple seasons.\nIn the model of Ilardi and Barzilai (2008) (which has been used by Macdonald (2010) in the\ncontext of estimating the abilities of NHL players) the home advantage parameter only acts\nwhen the home players are in possession, whereas in the present article it also modelled as an\neffect when they are defending. This article further extends the results of Ilardi and Barzilai\n(2008) by providing a combined measure of player ability and a method for analysing results\nfrom a single season informed by data from previous seasons. Furthermore the utility of game\nstatistics in predicting offensive and defensive ability is also considered here.\nA summary of the paper is as follows. In section 2, the data collection process will be\nreviewed and the new models for within and between year analyses presented. In section 3 the\nability of players at the end of the 2008\u20132009 season are estimated. In section 4, the use of\ngame statistics in inferring player ability is addressed. The article ends with a discussion.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Data Collection\nThe information required to fit the proposed model is available from the ESPN website in the\nform of individual game \u2018play\u2013by\u2013play\u2019 and \u2018box score\u2019 records (ESPN, 2010). For each\nregular season match, the box score pages provide summary statistics by player and the\nplay\u2013by\u2013play pages give a detailed record of events over the course of the match. The\n3\nplay\u2013by\u2013play pages consist of a list of important events on court together with the time at\nwhich the event occurred. Using the available information on substitutions, together with the\nlist of \u2018starters\u2019 (players on court at the start of the match) from the box score page, it is\npossible to infer exactly which 10 players are on court at any time during the match and\nfurthermore exactly which team is in possession at any time. The latter requires the mild\nassumption that between time records, possession remains in one team and that all changes of\npossession are recorded.\nAny quarter or overtime period of a game may therefore be split up into small intervals of\ntime in which the players on court remain constant (this will be taken as the definition of the\nword \u2018interval\u2019 in this paper). The duration of these intervals, the number of possessions for\neach team and the number of points gained (or conceded) in that space of time can be\ninferred from the play by play data. In the course of one season, there are of the order of\n30000 such intervals, so some data error is to be expected. In the analysis to follow, any\ninterval in which it was not possible to infer the exact 10 players on court was excluded from\nthe analysis; this restriction meant that approximately 10% of all available data was excluded.\nUsing the game summary information from the box score page, it was possible to cross check\ninferences from the play\u2013by\u2013play pages for games with complete information (ie those games\nin which there were no apparent errors), this included total time on pitch by player and total\ninferred game time; the corroboration between these two sources was excellent.\n2.2 The New Model\nSuppose there are currently N players in the NBA; let {\u03b1i}Ni=1 and {\u03b2i}Ni=1 denote respectively\nthe attacking and defensive ability of each player. For each game let H be the the home team\nand A the away team. Suppose the number of intervals in the game is n and for interval k, the\nnumber of possessions for team H is nHk and for team A is nAk (so that n =\n\u2211\nk(nHk + nAk)).\nIf team H (resp. A) comes into possession in interval k, let yHk (resp. yAk) be the total\nnumber of points scored by team H (resp. A) in the interval. This gives the model:\n100\u00d7 yHk = nHk\n( \u2211\ni:home player i on court\n\u03b1i \u2212\n\u2211\nj:away player j on court\n\u03b2j + \u03b3 +\n\u03c3\u221a\nnHk\n\u000fHk\n)\n, (1)\n100\u00d7 yAk = nAk\n( \u2211\ni:away player i on court\n\u03b1i \u2212\n\u2211\nj:home player j on court\n\u03b2j \u2212 \u03b3 + \u03c3\u221a\nnAk\n\u000fAk\n)\n, (2)\n4\nwhere \u000fAk and \u000fHk are independent standard normal random variables, \u03c3 is a positive scaling\nparameter fro the noise and \u03b3 is a constant representing the home advantage over\napproximately half of the course of a match (see below). A typical basketball game has of the\norder of 100 possessions, hence the function of the multiplicative factor on the LHS of (1) and\n(2) is to scale the estimates of the \u03b1s and \u03b2s so that they can be interpreted at the more\nmeaningful game level; a similar idea was used by Rosenbaum (2004); Ilardi and Barzilai\n(2008).\nThe interpretation of the parameters is that, for a set of 5 home players, K, and 5 different\naway players, L, where K,L \u2282 {1, . . . , N}, assuming nHk = nAk for all k, the quantity,\n\u2211\nk\u2208K\n(\u03b1k + \u03b2k)\u2212\n\u2211\nl\u2208L\n(\u03b1l + \u03b2l) + 2\u03b3,\nwould be the expected score difference between the home and away players over a period of\ntime approximately equal to that of a typical NBA game without overtime. A possible\ncriticism of the above model is the use of a Gaussian error term, since the chosen outcome\nvariable is always non\u2013negative. The model is justifiable on the basis of a central limit\ntheorem argument: a game consists of a series of around 100 alternating possessions, the\noutcome of the game being the difference in the sum of points scored by each team in their\nshare of possessions (Harville, 2003). Although the parameters \u03b1i and \u03b2j are not identified by\nthis model (which means that the likelihood of the observed data is unchanged if the same\nconstant is added to each \u03b1i and \u03b2j) their relative difference is estimable, which allows ratings\nand standard errors to be constructed directly using the posterior density of the unknown\nparameters.\nThe parameters \u03b3 and \u03c3 were treated as fixed, which is justifiable on the basis that there is a\nlot of information in the data on these quantities. The other parameters in the model were\nassumed to be drawn from Gaussian distributions, which represent the variability in offensive\nand defensive ability of NBA players,\n\u03b1i \u223c N (\u00b5\u03b1, \u03c32\u03b1), (3)\n\u03b2i \u223c N (\u00b5\u03b2, \u03c32\u03b2);\nthe posterior will therefore also be Gaussian. The fixed parameters and prior\n5\nhyperparameters were estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) and are given in Table 1.\nParameter \u00b5\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 \u00b5\u03b2 \u03c3\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03c3\nEstimate 9.82 2.55 -9.12 1.82 1.43 106.8\nTable 1: Prior hyperparameter estimates.\nThe interpretation of these parameters is that 1\n100\n(5\u00b5\u03b1 \u2212 5\u00b5\u03b2 + 2\u03b3) = 0.98 is the expected\nnumber of points scored by a team on their home court (see (1)) in one possession; the\nstandard error is 1.1.\nOne point of interest from Table 1 is that the estimated prior hyperparameter for the variance\nof the \u03b2s is smaller than that for the \u03b1s, this indicates that under the proposed model, players\nare more similar in terms of defensive ability than in terms of offensive ability. The ML\nestimate of \u03b3 suggests that there is a home\u2013court advantage of around three points, which was\nsimilar to the figure of 3.6 found by Entine and Small (2008), using data from two seasons.\n2.3 Allowing Player Strength to Vary Over Time\nA further extension is to consider the strength of players over a number of years. This is most\nsimply achieved by using the model described above in equations (1) and (2) for each year.\nFor the first year the priors given by (3) are used, then for subsequent years, a model is\nintroduced to describe how a player\u2019s ability may change from year to year. Let \u03b1\n(t)\ni and\n\u03b1\n(t\u22121)\ni be the respectively the offensive ability of player i at the start of season t and at the\nend of season t\u2212 1; define similar terms for the defensive abilities, \u03b2i. A simple way to allow\nfor a change in ability between seasons is to assume,\n\u03b1\n(t)\ni = p\u03b1\n(t\u22121)\ni + (1\u2212 p)\u00b5\u03b1 + s\u03b1\u000fi, \u03b2(t)i = p\u03b2(t\u22121)i + (1\u2212 p)\u00b5\u03b2 + s\u03b2\u000fi, (4)\nwhere s\u03b1, s\u03b2 > 0 and \u000fi\niid\u223c N (0, 1). If a new player starts in season t, then he is assigned a\nnormal prior, as per (3). The two effects of this end\u2013of\u2013year transition are firstly that p\nshrinks each parameter estimate towards the prior mean, \u00b5\u03b1 or \u00b5\u03b2; secondly, by adding either\nN (0, s2\u03b1) or N (0, s2\u03b2) noise, the uncertainty in each of the estimates is increased whilst some of\nthe correlation structure learned to\u2013date is preserved (the off\u2013diagonal correlations being\nshrunk towards zero). Increasing the uncertainty in the estimates at the end of the year is\nimportant because it allows each player\u2019s ability to vary over time: one might expect a player\n6\nto (at least initially) improve with experience, but also they may have been injured during the\nprevious season or change teams at the end. Using data from the 2006\/2007 \u2013 2008\/2009\nseasons, the respective maximum likelihood estimates of p, s\u03b1 and s\u03b2 were 0.83, 1.23 and 0.59.\n2.4 Estimating Ability in a Single Season\nIt is often of interest to estimate how well each player has performed in just the most recent\nseason, one example being the decision as to who should receive the annual NBA awards.\nWhilst it is possible to obtain such estimates using multiple years data and the methodology\ndiscussed thus far, the estimates of ability obtained from these models can be heavily\ninfluenced by performance in previous seasons (consider the example of the combined ability\nof Kevin Garnett in the results section). For rookie players, the methodology discussed does\nnot present any problems as there is no information from previous years on the ability of\nthese players. For non\u2013rookie players on the other hand, data from earlier seasons is still\nuseful because it enables better estimates of how good the other players are, but the manner\nin which this information should be included requires care. In this section, a method for\nhandling information from previous seasons is presented, this method may be used to\nestimate the abilities of non\u2013rookie players in a particular season.\nSuppose interest is in estimating how well player i performed in the most recent season. The\napproach suggested here is to use data from the most recent season to estimate the parameters\nassociated with player i; but data from all seasons to estimate the parameters associated with\nthe other players. The simplest way of implementing this is to analyse all seasons\u2019 data, as in\nSection 2.3, but changing the prior distribution for \u03b1i and \u03b2i for the most recent season so\nthat it is independent of data in previous seasons. If t denotes the most recent season, this is\nachieved by imposing the prior \u03b1\n(t)\ni \u223c N (\u00b5\u03b1, \u03c32\u03b1) and \u03b2(t)i \u223c N(\u00b5\u03b2, \u03c32\u03b2); rather than using (4).\nThe posterior distribution for \u03b1\n(t)\ni and \u03b2\n(t)\ni under this model is a measure of how well player i\nperformed in that season. This method reduces the standard errors of parameter estimates\ncompared to those that would be obtained with a single season\u2019s data under model (1)\u2013(2).\nThe model in this section will henceforth be referred to as model (2.4).\n7\n3 Results\n3.1 2008\/2009 Season Results\nIn this section the 2009 season results will be presented. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give respectively\noffensive, defensive and combined player ratings, with standard errors in parentheses, and\nrankings for the top ten players under the three scenarios described. The ratings and rankings\nin the second column of these tables correspond to model (1)\u2013(2) using the 2007\u20132009 data; in\nthe third column are results from the same model, but only using the 2009 data; and the\nfourth column gives the results from model (2.4). The parameter estimates in these tables are\ncentred.\nUnder model (1)\u2013(2), the 2007\u20132009 data gives greater accuracy in predicting player ability\ncompared to using the 2009 data only; however it may not always be appropriate to use\ninformation from previous years. The estimates in the third column are therefore the best\nestimates of player abilities using only 2009 season information, and those in the fourth are\nthe overall best estimates for this season using all available information.\nFor the 2009 season only (columns three and four), there was much similarity between the\nresults from model (1)\u2013(2) and model (2.4); both models identifying the same top three\nplayers in the same order for the combined ratings. One of the interesting point from these\ntables is that using the 2007\u20132009 data, Kevin Garnett (the most highly paid player in 2009)\nis identified as the number 3 player, but by using only the 2009 data, he ranks 13th\/12th.\nThe likely cause of this is the fact that during a game against the Utah Jazz, Garnett strained\nhis right knee: he was forced to miss the next 14 games and played in four further games\nbefore missing the final 25 games due to a right knee sprain (Associated Press, 2009; Spears,\n2009). Thus considering data from one season in isolation does not give a complete picture of\na player\u2019s ability.\nIn the Bayesian framework advocated in this article, it is of interest to compute the posterior\nprobability that one player is stronger than another. For players A and B, the marginal joint\nposterior density of their respective combined abilities is multivariate Gaussian. It is therefore\nstraightforward to compute the posterior probability that the combined ability of player A is\nlarger that that of player B. These probabilities were computed for a subset of players using\nthe 2007\u20132009 data, the results are in Table 5.

Computed using the 2007\u20132009 data.\n10\n4 Player Statistics\nAs mentioned in the introduction, one common, but ad hoc, means of rating NBA players is\nby using their individual game statistics. In this section it will be considered whether the 2009\ngame statistics can predict player ability and if so, which of the game\u2013statistics are important.\nConsider estimating the offensive ability of player i, \u03b1i. Given covariate information (the\ngame statistics) for this player, Xij, a simple linear model would take the form,\n\u03b1i =\n\u2211\nj\najXij + \u03c3a\u000fi, (5)\nwhere \u000fi\niid\u223c N (0, 1) and \u03c3a > 0 is the residual variance. One problem with this model is that\nthe quantity \u03b1i is unknown, however it can be estimated as described earlier using model\n(2.4) for example.\nThe approach advocated here is therefore to replace \u03b1i in (5) by the estimate, \u03b1\u02c6i, and to allow\nthe variance of each of the observations to vary to account for the relative precision of the\nestimated \u03b1\u02c6i. This leads to a linear model of the form,\n\u03b1\u02c6i =\n\u2211\nj\najXij + S.E.(\u03b1\u02c6i)\u03bdi, (6)\nwhere \u03bdi\niid\u223c N (0, 1) and Xij corresponds to the value of the explanatory variable Xj in Table 6\nfor player i. The quantities, \u03b1\u02c6i and S.E.(\u03b1\u02c6i)\n2, can be read directly from the estimated vector of\nmeans and from the leading diagonal of the estimated covariance matrix. A similar model was\nalso set up for estimating \u03b2\u02c6i as a linear combination of the covariates, but with coefficients bj.\nUnder model (6), the variance of \u03b1\u02c6i is S.E.(\u03b1\u02c6i)\n2. Since this is different for each player, the\nestimates of the parameters aj are given by weighted least squares. Covariates were chosen\nvia backwards selection, starting from the saturated model, excluding independent variables\nclearly not linked to the dependent variable (for example mean points scored was excluded\nfrom the defensive model). An intercept term was included in the model, though the\ncoefficient of this term is not reported as it does not affect rankings derived from the fitted\nvalues.\nTable 6 presents the results from these two linear models as well as listing the explanatory\n11\nStandardised Not Standardised\nStatistic Off.

The potential covariates of \u20183 pointer%\u2019, \u2018blocks\/40 mins\u2019 and \u2018personal fouls\/40\nmins\u2019 were not found to be significant in either model. Standardising (centring and scaling)\nthe outcome and explanatory variables makes it easier to identify which effects have the\ngreatest influence on ability; the un\u2013standardised coefficients are also provided in this table\nfor ease of reference. For the offensive model, it is perhaps not surprising that the number of\npoints scored and the number of assists are the most important predictors of ability. These\nresults further suggest that not losing possession and rebounds are more important than free\nthrow or field goal accuracy.\nPlots of the dependent variables against fitted values are shown in Figure 1, these plots show\na clear evidence of a linear trend in the case of the offensive abilities, but not in the case of\ndefensive ability. From the plot of the fitted offensive abilities, there is some evidence that the\nbest players (in terms of the \u03b1\u02c6s) also have much better game statistics than the rest \u2013\nconsider the points in the top right corner of the plot. Of the ten game statistics considered,\nonly steals, blocks and rebounds are potentially connected with defensive ability. There is no\nrecorded information on, for example whether a fast\u2013breaking team are contained by the\nforwards or guards. One possible problem with the fit of the defensive model may therefore be\na lack of relevant covariate information.\nAssuming that a linear model is appropriate for these data, the results in this table give the\ncoefficients, aj and bj, that can be used to predict player ability. For example in the case of\nthe offensive model, the predicted strength of player i is given by the expected value of \u03b1\u02c6i\nunder the model,\nE[\u03b1\u02c6i] =\n\u2211\nj\u2208{1,...,6}\najXij,\n12\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n6 8 10 12 14 16\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\u03b1^\nFi\ntte\nd\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u221212 \u221211 \u221210 \u22129 \u22128 \u22127 \u22126\n\u2212\n9.\n5\n\u2212\n9.\n0\n\u2212\n8.\n5\n\u03b2^\nFi\ntte\nd\nFigure 1: Plots of estimated ability against fitted values from the regression model (6). The\nmarkers are scaled according to the variance from (1)\u2013(2), with lager markers having less\nuncertainty from the original fit. The respective R2 values for the offensive\/defensive fits were\n0.41 and 0.03.\nThe fitted values from this linear model gives another means of rating and ranking players\u2019\noffensive ability. The top ten offensive players using these fitted values are LeBron James,\nChris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Dirk Nowitzki, Deron\nWilliams, Brandon Roy, Steve Nash; seven of these players feature in Table 2.\n4.1 Offensive Ability of Forwards and Guards\nThe three main types of position on court have different functionality in their offensive and\ndefensive modes. For example, one aspect of the defensive ability of a guard is expertise in\nmanoeuvres that prevent effective progress of the offense up the court \u2013 they must me able to\ncontend with players dribbling the ball. The function of the guards and forwards on the\noffense is also different: the former being more concerned with governing the general form of\nan attack and obtaining field goals, and the latter with shooting from the side of the court\nand obtaining rebounds (Ambler, 1979).\nThe linear model (6) was fitted to subsets of the players (all guards and all forwards\nseparately) with the aim of finding any differences in covariate choice for predicting offensive\nability. Using backward selection as above, the standardised covariate effects with standard\nerrors in parenthesis are as follows. For the forwards, the most important ability were points\nscored, 0.47 (0.08); then assists, 0.44 (0.08); turnovers \u22120.29 (0.09); and lastly rebounds, 0.17\n13\n(0.08). For the guards the significant effects were points scored, 0.42 (0.07); personal fouls,\n\u22120.23 (0.07); then assists, 0.20 (0.06); and lastly field goals, 0.19 (0.07). The R2 values were\nrespectively 0.40 and 0.47 for the forwards and guards. It is interesting to note that the\ndifferent functions of the points and guards are reflected in the choice of covariates in these\nmodels: for the forwards, the ability to rebound is identified as important, whereas for the\nguards, shooting accuracy is relevant.\n5 Discussion\nThis article introduces a new method for estimating both the offensive and defensive ability of\nNBA players and a justifiable way of conjoining this information to derive a combined\nestimate of player utility. To the knowledge of the authors, the model presented here is\nunique in providing a structured means of updating player abilities between years. One of the\nmost important findings here is that whilst using player game statistics and a simple linear\nmodel to infer offensive ability may be okay, the very poor fit of the defensive ratings model\nsuggests that defensive ability depends on some trait not measured by the current range of\nplayer game statistics.\nAt the end of each season, the NBA presents players with awards including \u2018Most Valuable\nPlayer\u2019 (MVP), \u2018Defensive Player of the Year\u2019, \u2018Rookie of the Year\u2019 and \u2018Most Improved\nPlayer\u2019 (MIP); though there is no material prize for the winning player, the awards are highly\nprestigious. The NBA employs a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters to rank their top five\n(in the case of the MVP award) or top three players. The individual rankings are combined\nby weighting each with respect to the voted position eg 10 points for first place votes and\nrespectively 7, 5, 3, 1 for 2nd to 5th place (NBA, 2010) and summing these over voters.\nAlthough the sportswriters and broadcasters are undoubtedly experts in their field, the\nrhetoric accompanying the announcement of the awards repeatedly refers to the much\npublished player game statistics NBA (2009). It is of interest to compare the results presented\nhere with those of the NBA committee.\nThe 2009 MVP according to model (2.4) was LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) since he\nhas the highest estimated combined ability from Table 2, this is in agreement with the NBA\ndecision. Similarly the best defensive player in 2009 was Lamar Odom (Los Angeles Lakers),\n14\nhere the NBA presented the award to Dwight Howard, who was ranked 34th by the new\nmethod. In order to rank rookie players, the approach advocated here is to use the combined\nratings ratings from the 2007\u20132009 data, since in this setting the ability of non\u2013rookie players\nis more accurately estimated by including historical data. The best rookie player here goes to\nRussell Westbrook of Oklahoma City Thunder (the award was given to Derrick Rose of the\nChicago Bulls, ranked 27th by the new model). To compute the most improved player is a\nsimple case of comparing the combined estimates of ability obtained from successive historical\nrankings, for example by using all available data up to 2008 and then all available data up to\nto 2009 \u2013 excluding rookies, the largest difference between the combined estimates thus\nobtained gives the most improved player. Using the new method the 2009 MIP was Hakim\nWarrick of the Memphis Grizzlies (the NBA presented this award to Danny Granger of the\nIndiana Pacers, who was ranked 6th by the method described here).\nReferences\nAmbler, V.
