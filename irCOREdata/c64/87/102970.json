In this paper, a tight closed-\nform approximation of the ergodic capacity over log-normal\nfading channels is derived. This expression can be easily used to\nevaluate and compare the ergodic capacities of communication\nsystems operating over log-normal fading channels. We also uti-\nlize this expression to show that the capacity of a multi-antennas\nUWB system operating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel can be\nimproved mainly through receive diversity.\nIndex Terms\u2014Log-normal distribution, fading channels, er-\ngodic capacity, closed-form, hyperbolic functions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHE log-normal distribution has long been used predom-inantly in communications to model the effect of shad-\nowing due to large obstructions [1], i.e., medium-scale fading.\nRecently, the log-normal distribution has been applied to\ndescribe the small-scale fading in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel\nmodel [2], for indoor ultra-wideband (UWB) communications\n[3]. More generally, the amplitude distribution of slowly\nvarying communication channels, e.g., indoor environments,\ntends to be log-normal [4].\nChannel capacity and probability of error are common\nmetrics used to evaluate the performance of communication\nsystems. The calculations of channel capacity and probability\nof error over typical fading channels, such as Rayleigh, Rician,\nNakagami, and Hoyt, have attracted considerable research\ninterests over the past decade [5]\u2013[11]. The error probability\nof communication systems operating over log-normal fading\nchannels was commonly expressed using a computable for-\nmula in [8] until an accurate closed-form approximation was\nderived in [12]. As for the capacity, it was first upper and\nlower bounded in [13]. These two bounds are closed-form\nexpressions but unfortunately are loose for low signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) values. Recently in [4], an accurate computable\nformula, which is the truncation of an infinite alternating\nseries and is not a closed-form expression, was proposed\nfor evaluating the capacity of log-normal fading channels.\nManuscript received July 22, 2008; revised October 3, 2008, January 21,\n2009, and March 18, 2009; accepted March 19, 2009.

In\nSection III, we first derive a very tight closed-form ap-\nproximation of the conventional integral formulation of the\nergodic capacity [13] for low dB spread values; we then show\nthat this expression is the greatest lower bound (GLB) on\nthe ergodic capacity in terms of dB spread for any SNR\nvalues. In Section IV, we design a parametric function that\nbest fits the difference between the exact ergodic capacity\nand its GLB, by using a heuristic curve fitting method [9]\u2013\n[12], [15]. We obtain a tight closed-form approximation of\nthe ergodic capacity, which is a function of the system\nSNR and the dB spread of the log-normal fading channel,\nby minimizing this difference. Numerical results show that\nour closed-form approximation differs from the conventional\nintegral formulation of the ergodic capacity [13] by less than\n0.01 nats\/s\/Hz for any SNR and dB spread values lying in the\nrange of interest for wireless communications. Our expression\nis more simplified than the computable formula proposed\nin [4] and [14], but with similar accuracy, and is far more\naccurate than the closed-form approximation derived in [14],\nas it is evidently shown in Section IV. In Section V, we\nuse our expression to interpret the behavior of the capacity\nat high SNRs and we provide a criterion to easily compare\nthe capacities of any two systems operating over log-normal\nfading channels. We also utilize this expression to compute\nthe ergodic capacities of single-input single-output (SISO)\nand multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) UWB systems\noperating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel, and show that\nmulti-antennas UWB systems can mainly benefit from receive\ndiversity to increase their capacities. Finally, conclusions are\ndrawn in Section VI. Some preliminary results of this work\nhave been presented in [16].\nII. SYSTEM MODEL FOR LOG-NORMAL FADING\nCHANNEL CAPACITY\nIn wireless communications, medium-scale fading is usually\nmodeled as a multiplicative and slowly time-varying random\nprocess. Accordingly, the received signal r(t) is given by [1]\nr(t) =\n\u221a\n\u0002s(t)h(t) + n(t), (1)\nwhere \u0002 is the average transmitted signal energy, s(t) is the\ntransmitted signal, h(t) is the random process that charac-\nterizes medium-scale fading, and n(t) is an additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) process with a double-sided variance\n1536-1276\/09$25.00 c\u00a9 2009 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Medium-scale fading is considered as log-normally\ndistributed for any values of t. In a slow-varying environ-\nment, h(t) can be considered constant over multiple symbol\nperiods such that h(t) = \u03b2 is a log-normally distributed\nrandom variable (RV). As far as indoor UWB communication\nis concerned, the multipath attenuation factors of the IEEE\n802.15.3a channel model [2] are log-normally distributed, and\nthe received signal r(t) can be expressed as in (1) with\nh(t) =\n\u2211\nk Gk\u03b4(t \u2212 \u03c4k) [17], [18], where \u03b4(t) denotes the\nDirac delta function, \u03c4k is the k-th time delay, Gk =\u03b2kej\u03b8k is\nthe k-th multipath attenuation factor, \u03b2k is a log-normal RV,\nand \u03b8k\u2208{0, \u03c0} is an uniformly distributed RV [2].\nThe ergodic capacity of a log-normal fading channel is\nexpressed as follows [13]\nCe = E[ln(1 + \u03b3\u03b1)] = 2\u03bb\n\u222b +\u221e\n0\nln(1 + \u03b3\u03b1)p(\u03b1)d\u03b1, (2)\nwhere \u03b3 = \u0002\/N0 is the average SNR, \u03bb = 12 if\nthe capacity is expressed in nats\/s\/Hz or \u03bb = 12 ln(2)\nif the capacity is expressed in bits\/s\/Hz, and p(\u03b1) =\n1\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b1\nexp\n(\n\u2212 12 [(ln (\u03b1)\u2212m\u03b1)\/\u03c3\u03b1]2\n)\nis the probability\ndensity function of a log-normally distributed RV \u03b1, where m\u03b1\nand \u03c3\u03b1 are the mean and standard deviation of ln (\u03b1), respec-\ntively. Concerning medium-scale fading, \u03b1 = \u03b22, where \u03b22\nis log-normally distributed since \u03b2 is log-normally distributed\ntoo. In the case of indoor UWB channel, \u03b1 \u0004 \u2211k \u03b22k , as\nshown in [17] and [18]. According to the results in [19]\u2013[21]\nand the novel method recently proposed in [22], the sum of\nlog-normal RVs can be well-approximated by an equivalent\nlog-normal RV for a wide range of dB spread values. Thus,\nthe ergodic capacity formula in (2) can be applied to both\nmedium-scale fading and indoor UWB channel.\nIn wireless communications, parameters (my, \u03c3y) are in-\ntroduced to characterize a log-normal distribution, where\nmy = \u03bam\u03b1, \u03c3y = \u03ba\u03c3\u03b1 and \u03ba = 10\/ ln (10) [19]. The\nparameter \u03c3y , known as the dB spread, is between 6 and 12\ndB for medium-scale fading [19], between 3 and 5 dB for the\nSISO indoor UWB channel [2], and between 1 and 4 dB for\nthe MIMO indoor UWB channel as computed in Tables 5.1\nand 5.2 of [23]. Without loss of generality, its range of values\ncan be aggregated as \u03c3y \u2208 [1, 12] dB for most communication\nsystems operating over log-normal fading channels.

(10)\nThe accuracy of our proposed approximation C0e is measured,\nas in [14], by using the metric \u0394C0e = |Ce \u2212 C0e |, where\n\u0394C0e represents the approximation error between C\n0\ne and Ce in\nnats\/s\/Hz. As depicted in Fig. 1, where \u0394C0e is plotted against\n\u03c3y and \u03b3\u0302dB, C0e is accurate for low \u03c3y values, i.e., \u03c3y\u22642 dB,\nregardless of \u03b3\u0302dB, and for \u03c3y \u2208 [0.01, 20] dB with high \u03b3\u0302dB\nvalues, i.e., \u03b3\u0302dB\u226530 dB. The accuracy of C0e increases as \u03c3y\ngets lower. Moreover, for any x\u2208R, \u03c3y\u22650 and \u03b3\u0302dB \u2208 R, the\ninequalities f(x) \u2265 f(0) \u2265 0 and g(x) \u2265 0 hold.

Fur-\nthermore, Ce = C0e for \u03c3y = 0, thus, C\n0\ne = inf{\u03c3y \u2265 0 : Ce},\ni.e., C0e is the GLB of the ergodic capacity over log-normal\nfading channels in terms of dB spread for any \u03b3\u0302dB values.\nIV.

In the heuristic\ncurve fitting method proposed in [15], a parametric function is\ndesigned in terms of elementary functions and three indepen-\ndent parameters to solve a curve fitting problem. In this paper,\nwe use this curve fitting method to design the parametric\nfunction \u03c6(\u03c3y , \u03b3\u0302dB) that tightly fits \u0394C0e for \u03c3y \u2208 [0.01, 12]\ndB and a large range of \u03b3\u0302dB values. We first numerically\nevaluated ln(\u0394C0e ) for different values of \u03c3y and collected\nthe obtained curves in Fig. 2. It can be noticed that ln(\u0394C0e )\npresents the feature of an even function with a unique max-\nimum occurring at \u03b3\u0302dB = 0 dB, denoted by ln(\u0394C0e (0)). In\naddition, this function decreases linearly as |\u03b3\u0302dB| increases. In\nthe effort to obtain the function that best fits these curves,\nthe curve fitting method leads to the parametric function\nln(\u03c6(\u03c3y , \u03b3\u0302dB)) = ln(\u0394C0e (0)) \u2212 \u03b71 ln\n(\ncosh\n(\n\u03b3\u0302dB\n\u03b72\n))\n, which\nprovides a satisfying approximation for any of the ln(\u0394C0e )\ncurves, as illustrated in Fig. 2, for \u03c3y = 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10\ndB, \u03b71 = 2.01, 2.01, 2.02, 4.2, and \u03b72 = 8.71, 8.71, 8.79, 19,\nrespectively. The parameters ln(\u0394C0e (0)), \u03b71 and \u03b72 clearly\ndepend on the value of \u03c3y , and their values increase as \u03c3y\nincreases, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.\nConsequently, we obtain that\n\u03c6(\u03c3y , \u03b3\u0302dB) =\n\u03b70\n2\u03ba\ne\n\u2212\u03b71 ln\n(\ncosh\n(\n\u03b3\u0302dB\n2\u03ba\u03b72\n))\n(11)\nis an appropriate choice of a parametric function, with\n\u03b70, \u03b71, \u03b72 \u2265 0, in order to tightly approximate \u0394C0e .

APPLICATIONS OF C\u0302e\nA. Capacity of the log-normal fading channel at high SNRs\nOur closed-form expression in (13) can be used to interpret\nthe behavior of the ergodic capacity Ce at high SNRs. As-\nsuming in (13) that \u03b3\u0302dB \t 2\u03ba\u03b72, it implies that the term\n1\/ cosh\u03b71\n(\n\u03b3\u0302dB\n2\u03ba\u03b72\n)\nis equivalent to e\n\u2212\u03b71\n(\n\u03b3\u0302dB\n2\u03ba\u03b72\n\u2212ln(2)\n)\n, which\ngoes towards zero as \u03b3\u0302dB increases since \u03b71, \u03b72, and \u03ba are\npositive constants. Therefore, Ce \u0004 C\u0302e \u0004 C0e in (10) at high\nSNRs. Moreover, knowing that the term ln\n(\n2 cosh\n(\n\u03b3\u0302dB\n2\u03ba\n))\nin\n(10) is equivalent to \u03b3\u0302dB2\u03ba for \u03b3\u0302dB \t 2\u03ba, the ergodic capacity of\na log-normal fading channel can be simplified at high SNRs\nas follows\nCe \u0004 2\u03bb\n\u03ba\n(\u03b3dB + my) . (14)\nThus, the capacity is a linear function of the SNR at high\nSNRs, which is consistent with the result obtained in [24].\nAlso, notice that for my = 0, this capacity is equal to the\ncapacity of an AWGN channel, i.e., 2\u03bb ln(1 + exp(\u03b3dB\/\u03ba))\n[25], at high SNRs.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Ergodic capacity of SISO-UWB systems for different channel\nscenarios and various combining methods.\nB. Capacities of SISO and MIMO-UWB systems over the\nIEEE 802.15.3a channel model\nOur closed-form expression in (13) can also be used to cal-\nculate effectively and accurately the ergodic capacity of com-\nmunication systems over log-normal fading channels. Here,\nwe provide some results concerning the ergodic capacities\nof SISO and MIMO-UWB systems operating over the IEEE\n802.15.3a channel.\nIn a MIMO-UWB system, assuming perfect channel es-\ntimation and accurate timing synchronization, the receiver\noutput SNR associated with equal gain combining (EGC)\nand maximum ratio combining (MRC) can be expressed as\n\u03b3 = \u03b3\u03b1, with \u03b1 defined as follows [23]\n\u03b1 =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u239b\u239dNr\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n|\u03b2\u03c1,n,f |\n\u239e\u23a02 \/(NrN2t Nf) , for EGC,\nNr\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b22\u03c1,n,f\/Nt , for MRC,\n(15)\nrespectively, where Nr is the number of receive antennas, Nt\nis the number of transmit antennas, and Nf is the number of\nmultipath over each receive-transmit antenna pairs.\nAs explained in [19]\u2013[22], the sum of independent or corre-\nlated log-normal RVs can be well-approximated by an equiv-\nalent log-normal RV. Thus, the effect of the log-normal fading\nchannel upon any communication system can be modeled by\nusing an equivalent log-normal RV. For instance, it has been\nshown in [23] that the effect of several independent log-normal\nmultipath attenuation factors of the IEEE 802.15.3a channel\nmodel can be appropriately combined into an equivalent log-\nnormal RV. Numerical values of the mean m\u03b1 and standard\ndeviation \u03c3\u03b1 of the equivalent log-normal RV \u03b1 have been\nobtained considering either MRC or EGC, various numbers\nof multipath, and different numbers of transmit antennas, in\nTables 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 and 5.2 of [23]. These values have been\nfirst derived by using a theoretical approach and then verified\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\nNumber of antenna elements n\nE\nrg\nod\nic\n C\nap\nac\nity\n (\nna\nts\n\/s\n\/H\nz)\n \n \nCM2, Nt = n, Nr = 1\nCM2, Nt = 1, Nr = n\nCM2, Nt = n, Nr = n\nCM3, Nt = n, Nr = 1\nCM3, Nt = 1, Nr = n\nCM3, Nt = n, Nr = n\nCM4, Nt = n, Nr = 1\nCM4, Nt = 1, Nr = n\nCM4, Nt = n, Nr = n\nFig. 6. Ergodic capacity of MIMO-UWB systems for different channel\nscenarios and various numbers of transmit and receive antennas.\nthrough simulations.\nInserting the values of m\u03b1 and \u03c3\u03b1 from the Tables 4.2, 4.3\nof [23] in (13), the ergodic capacity of a SISO-UWB system\nover various channel scenarios of the IEEE 802.15.3a channel\nmodel, i.e., CM1-4 [2], is plotted in Fig. 5, by applying\neither EGC or MRC, for Nf = 20, Nt = 1, and Nr = 1.\nThe results show that MRC provides an extra 0.2 nats\/s\/Hz\ncapacity improvement compared to EGC, and the capacity\nover the line-of-sight (LOS) channel CM1 is 1.2 nats\/s\/Hz\nhigher than that over the worst non-LOS channel scenario\nCM4. Notice also that all the curves tend to be parallel at high\nSNRs, which is consistent with the result in (14). Therefore,\nthe ergodic capacity difference between any two systems A\nand B operating over a log-normal fading channel is constant\nat high SNRs and can be given by\n\u0394CA,Be = 2\u03bb|mA\u03b1 \u2212mB\u03b1 |, (16)\nwhere mA\u03b1 and m\nB\n\u03b1 are the mean values of the RVs \u03b1A and\n\u03b1B for systems A and B, respectively.\nIn Fig. 6, the ergodic capacity of a MIMO-UWB system\nover various channel scenarios, i.e., CM2-4, is plotted against\nthe number of antenna elements n which is considered at the\ntransmitter or at the receiver, by applying MRC with Nf = 20,\nand for \u03b3dB = 10 dB. Using (15) and the same method as in\n[23], we have obtained values of m\u03b1 and \u03c3\u03b1 for the different\nantenna configurations considered in Fig. 6 beforehand. The\nresults show that if the number of receive antennas is equal to\none, Nr = 1, increasing the number of transmit antennas has a\nvery limited effect on the capacity, which then saturates very\nfast. On the other hand, if the number of transmit antennas is\nequal to one, Nt = 1, the capacity increases in a logarithm\nway with the number of receive antennas. These results are in\nline with those obtained for a MIMO Rayleigh-fading channel\n[25]. However, if the number of transmit antennas is equal to\nthe number of receive antennas the capacity still increases in a\nlogarithm way with the number of receive antennas. This result\nis very different from the MIMO Rayleigh-fading channel\n[25], where it is well-known that the capacity increases lin-\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

As it has been indicated in [23], increasing the\nnumber of transmit antennas over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel\nhas a limited impact on the performance improvement in terms\nof bit error probability. A SNR gain of about 3 to 4 dB can\nbe observed when using one received antenna and two instead\nof one transmit antenna over CM2. This gain is marginal\ncompared to the 25 dB gain obtained in the MIMO Rayleigh-\nfading case. Thus, it can be concluded that mainly receive\ndiversity can be used to increase the capacity of MIMO-UWB\nsystems operating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA tight closed-form approximation of the ergodic capac-\nity for wireless communication systems operating over log-\nnormal fading channels has been derived. Its accuracy has been\nmaintained by finding values of parameters \u03b70, \u03b71 and \u03b72 that\nminimize a MSE criterion, and has been shown experimentally\nfor practical SNR and dB spread values. Our expression has\nbeen used to interpret the behavior of the ergodic capacity\nof log-normal fading channels at high SNRs, as well as to\nprovide a simple criterion for comparing the capacities of\nsystems operating over log-normal fading channels. Finally, its\napplication in evaluating the ergodic capacities of SISO and\nMIMO-UWB systems over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model\nhas been presented, and it has been shown that multi-antennas\nUWB systems can mainly benefit from receive diversity to\nincrease their capacities over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
