Introduction\n[2] The major process by which energy, mass, and\nmomentum are transferred from the solar wind into the\nmagnetosphere is magnetic reconnection at the dayside\nmagnetopause. The process of reconnection allows inter-\nplanetary magnetic flux tubes to couple with those in the\nmagnetosphere [Dungey, 1961] and enables plasma from\nthe solar wind and magnetosheath to enter the magneto-\nsphere along the newly joined flux tubes. Assuming time-\nvarying reconnection of the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, the motion of these\nflux tubes result in disturbances in the surrounding magnetic\nfield. The first signatures of open flux tube motion and their\nassociated disturbances were seen byHaerendel et al. [1978]\nin magnetic field data from the HEOS-2 spacecraft, and by\nRussell and Elphic [1978, 1979] in the ISEE-1 and -2 data\nwho termed them \u2018\u2018flux transfer events\u2019\u2019 (FTEs). These first\nobservational studies showed that the peculiar magnetic\nfield signatures of FTEs were bipolar perturbations in the\ncomponent normal to the magnetopause boundary and an\nenhancement of the overall magnetic field strength. The\nearly physical interpretation of these FTEs were L-shaped\nflux tube structures produced by patchy and impulsive\nreconnection near the subsolar magnetopause. These tubes\nhave a strong curvature where they cross the magnetopause\nand they are dragged poleward (dependent upon Bz IMF)\nand along the equatorial flanks (dependent upon By IMF)\nover the magnetopause due to magnetic tension and\nmagnetosheath flows. Additional studies by Berchem and\nRussell [1984], Russell et al. [1985], and Kawano and\nRussell [1996, 1997] indicate that FTEs are signatures of\nnonsteady patchy magnetic reconnection which are formed\nat the dayside magnetopause and travel around the mag-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A07S22, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012749, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\n2Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, INAF, Palermo, Italy.\n3Centre d\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Toulouse, France.\n4Department of Space and Climate Physics, Mullard Space Science\nLaboratory, University College London, Dorking, UK.\n5Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Katlenburg-Lindau,\nGermany.\n6Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012749$09.00\nA07S22 1 of 25\nnetopause in an antisunward direction. Later studies focus-\ning on particle observations showed that FTEs can also be\ncharacterized by a mixture of magnetosheath and magneto-\nspheric plasma [Daly et al., 1981; Scholer et al., 1982;\nPaschmann et al., 1982; Thomsen et al., 1987].\n[3] There have been many papers presenting observation-\nal features of FTEs (see, for example, Elphic [1995] and\nLockwood and Hapgood [1998] for reviews of FTE obser-\nvations and their interpretation), but there exist only a\nlimited number of studies on the motion and configuration\nof FTEs, including both modeling and observations [e.g.,\nCowley and Owen, 1989; Berchem et al., 1995; Fedder et\nal., 2002; Cooling et al., 2001; Kawano and Russell, 2005;\nPu et al., 2006; Robert et al., 2006; Fear et al., 2007]. Most\nrecently, case studies by Hasegawa et al. [2006] (recon-\nstruction study) and Raeder [2006] (modeling study) have\nshown the anatomy and formation process of these unsteady\nreconnection patches. The two studies concluded that in\ntheir cases the unsteady reconnection patches were a result\nof sequentially generated X-lines which then form dual or\nmultiple X-lines [Lee and Fu, 1985, 1986; Fu and Lee,\n1986] with a \u2018\u2018quasi-periodicity\u2019\u2019 [Rijnbeek et al., 1984;\nLockwood and Wild, 1993; Neudegg et al., 2000] caused by\nthe convection and reformation time [Raeder, 2006] of the\nflux tubes.\n[4] The magnetic footprints of newly opened flux tubes\nare connected to the Northern and Southern Hemispheres,\nrespectively, and can be observed using ionospheric high-\nfrequency (HF) coherent-scatter radars. FTEs produce\nionospheric disturbances caused by electron density irregu-\nlarities which drift with the newly opened flux tubes over\nthe auroral regions [Provan et al., 2002; Marchaudon et al.,\n2004]. These events are observed by ionospheric radars as\nhigh velocity antisunward transient flows which are inter-\npreted as the response to transient magnetopause reconnec-\ntion [Pinnock et al., 1993, 1995; Rodger and Pinnock,\n1997]. Studies by Provan et al. [1998] and Provan and\nYeoman [1999] showed quasi-periodic sequences of these\nobservations termed \u2018\u2018pulsed ionospheric flows\u2019\u2019 (PIFs),\nthese are also often seen as poleward-moving regions of\nenhanced backscatter power termed \u2018\u2018poleward-moving\nauroral radar forms\u2019\u2019 (PMRAFs). These radar forms are\nwidely accepted to be the auroral counterparts of FTEs [e.g.,\nSandholt et al., 1990; Thorolfsson et al., 2000]. The\nenhancement in the backscatter power is caused by electron\ndensity irregularities which are provoked by plasma particles\ngyrating down the flux tubes whilst they are still dragged over\nthe magnetopause. Since the flux tubes connect two points in\nspace, it is evident that only coordinated ground- and space-\nbased studies can describe the large-scale dynamics and\nstructure of FTEs over a large spatial region.\n[5] Elphic et al. [1990] presented the first simultaneous\nobservation of FTEs seen by the European Incoherent\nScatter (EISCAT) radar system and the ISEE-1 and -2\nspacecraft. In a further study Neudegg et al. [1999] pre-\nsented a coordinated space- and ground-based study of\nFTEs using magnetometer data from the Equator-S space-\ncraft and radar data obtained from several radars belonging\nto the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\noperating in a high temporal and spatial resolution mode.\nFollowing these single spacecraft conjunction studies, Wild\net al. [2001] presented the first concurrent study of FTEs\nusing multipoint measurements taken by the quartet of the\nESA Cluster spacecraft in conjunction with measurements\nfrom the Co-operative UK Twin-Located Auroral Sounding\nSystem (CUTLASS; two UK operated radars which are part\nof the SuperDARN network) and the EISCAT radar sys-\ntems. The simultaneous in situ measurements taken by the\nfour identical Cluster spacecraft allowedWild and coworkers\nto study the characteristics of the FTEs for the first time\nwith spatial and temporal information. Wild et al. [2001]\nshowed that the Cluster and CUTLASS signatures were\nclosely related and provide a direct indicator for mass,\nenergy, and momentum transfer into the magnetosphere-\nionosphere system resulting from pulsed reconnection sites\nas originally outlined by Dungey [1961]. In a further study\nWild et al. [2003] showed that the CUTLASS observations\nof the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere are closely corre-\nlated with similar SuperDARN observations in the Southern\nHemisphere ionosphere. On the basis of a comparison of\nboth hemisphere observations Wild et al. [2003] concluded\nthat the observations must have been actuated by either a\nsingle X-line extending over several hours magnetic local\ntime (MLT) in the prenoon and postnoon sectors of the\nmagnetopause or by multiple X-lines with a similar azimuth\ndisplacement in the high latitudes.\n[6] A subsequent theoretical study of the time period\nfrom 0915 to 1115 UT on the 14 February 2001 undertaken\nby Penz et al. [2006a, 2007] showed that by using the\nCagniard-deHoop method [Cagniard, 1962; De Hoop,\n1960, 1961; Heyn and Semenov, 1996] they could recon-\nstruct the electric field of the reconnection site based upon\nthe magnetic field measurements from Cluster. By using this\nmethod, Penz and coworkers calculated time series of the\nelectric field by performing the analytical inverse Laplace\ntransform of the Petschek-type model of reconnection.\n[7] From these theoretical considerations they also in-\nferred the distance of the reconnection sites from the\nspacecraft. Penz and coworkers [Penz et al., 2006a; Penz,\n2006] showed that the observed magnetospheric FTEs were\ncaused by a reconnection site located 4.0 \u00b1 2.1 RE from the\nCluster formation and that the FTEs observed in the\nmagnetosheath were caused by a reconnection site located\n3.7 \u00b1 1.5 RE away from the Cluster formation. Penz et al.\n[2007] further showed that the observed FTEs described by\nWild et al. [2001, 2003] were caused by reconnection bursts\nlasting about 2.6 \u00b1 0.9 min.\n[8] The next step in this line of investigations is presented\nin this paper. We recap briefly the simultaneous observation\nof the FTE signatures by the Cluster spacecraft and by the\nSuperDARN radars to constrain the spatial and temporal\nevolution of the observed features and then compare these\nobservations with a global MHD simulation to fill the gaps\nleft by the point measurements.\n[9] This combination of measurements with a global\nsimulation allows us for the first time to address in one\nstudy several features of FTEs which have been separately\ndiscussed in earlier investigations. Most significantly, the\nobservational features addressed by Wild et al. [2001, 2003]\nand Penz et al. [2006a, 2007] can now be shown in a three-\ndimensional large-scale context. Also the isolated features\nof FTEs pointed out in previous global MHD simulation\nstudies by Fedder et al. [2002] and Raeder [2006] can now\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n2 of 25\nA07S22\nbe put into context with concurrent space- and ground-based\nobservations.\n[10] The study presented here builds upon the initial\nsurvey of Berchem [2000] who showed the advantages of\nthe synergy of multipoint measurements from space- and\nground-based instruments combined with global MHD\nsimulations. Preliminary results for the interval of interest\n(first presented by Daum and Wild [2006]) are extended in\norder to present a unique mapping between the points of\nobservation exploiting a high-resolution MHD simulation.\nThis high-resolution data allows us to model a wide range\nof observational features of the FTEs from small to large\nscales in order to study the general dynamics of the\nphenomenon.\n2. Instrumentation\n[11] The modeling study undertaken in this paper is based\nupon a global MHD simulation of the geospace environ-\nment in order to link FTE observations from ground- and\nspace-based instruments on the 14 February 2001 in the\ntime from 0930 UT to 1100 UT. The analysis techniques\nand the ground- and space-based experiments for the time of\ninterest are described in detail by Wild et al. [2001, 2003]\nand Wilken et al. [2001] (discussed FTE observation from\n14 January 2001; orbital configuration, instrument setting,\nand observations were very similar to the ones presented\nhere) and the references therein. Therefore in this section we\nshall only briefly summarize the instruments employed.\n[12] We shall first address the main characteristics of the\nspace-based instruments followed by the main character-\nistics of the ground-based instruments employed. This\ndivision also represents the \u2018\u2018upper\/lower layer\u2019\u2019 mapping\nstructure utilized in the upcoming sections for combining\nthe global MHD simulation with the observations.\n[13] The space-based data presented in this study were\nobtained from the Cluster fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)\nexperiment [Balogh et al., 1997, 2001], the Cluster Ion\nSpectrometry (CIS) experiment [Re`me et al., 1997, 2001],\nthe Cluster Plasma Electron and Current Experiment\n(PEACE) [Johnstone et al., 1997; Owen et al., 2001], and\nthe Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors\nexperiment (RAPID) [Wilken et al., 1997, 2001].\n[14] The main ground-based observations were obtained\nfrom the SuperDARN radar systems [Greenwald et al.,\n1995] in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The main\nfocus herein lies on the Northern Hemisphere radar at\nHankasalmi (Finland) and for comparison the Southern Hemi-\nsphere radar located near the Syowa station (Antarctica). In\norder to estimate the large-scale ionospheric flow patterns,\nmultiple radar stations have been employed to create con-\nvection maps using the \u2018\u2018map-potential\u2019\u2019 method developed\nby [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998].\n2.1. Space-Based Instrumentation\n[15] The quartet of ESA Cluster spacecraft [Escoubet et\nal., 2001] were launched in July\/August 2000 into a highly\nelliptical orbit (19.6 (apogee)\/4.0 (perigee) RE). The orbital\nplane is fixed in the inertial frame of the Earth, therefore\nthe apogee processes through 24 h of local time (LT) with a\n12 month periodicity. The four spacecraft typically have a\ntetrahedral configuration near the magnetopause. The space-\ncraft formation allowed for the first time simultaneously\nthree-dimensional spatial and temporal studies of the geo-\nspace environment.\n[16] In Figure 1 we show the projection of the orbital path\nof Cluster 1 (Rumba) onto the x\u2013z and x\u2013y Geocentric\nSolar Magnetospheric (GSM) reference planes in the prin-\ncipal period of interest from 0930 to 1100 UT on the 14\nFebruary 2001, when the spacecraft were in a radial distance\nof 11.18\u201312.46 RE from the Earth at the vicinity of the\nmagnetopause. The satellite separation during the time of\ninterest varied from 530 to 590 km. A close up of the\nformation can be seen in the insets of Figure 1. The solid\ngray lines indicate the modeled magnetopause shape after\nShue et al. [1997] and the dashed lines indicate the modeled\nbow shock shape and location after Bennett et al. [1997].\nThe interval of interest corresponds to an outbound pass\nthrough the postnoon high-latitude magnetopause with an\nactual crossing of the magnetopause region in the time from\n1017 to 1031 UT.\n[17] A characteristic observational feature of FTEs is the\nhighly structured bipolar signature in the magnetic field\ncomponent normal to the magnetopause and an increase in the\ntotalmagnetic field strength. In order to show these featureswe\nutilize data from the FGM instrument onboard the Cluster\nspacecraft analyzed at 4 s resolution (corresponding approx-\nimately to a spin of the spacecraft).Wild et al. [2001] showed\nthat the observations made by the other three spacecraft are\nsimilar to those taken by Cluster 1 so that we concentrate\nhere only on the observations made by the FGM on board\nCluster 1 to identify the magnetic field FTE characteristics.\nLater in section 5 (Model results) data from all four\nspacecraft are used to examine the electric current density\nusing the so-called curlometer technique [Dunlop et al.,\n1988], while high-resolution FGM data with up to 67\nvectors\/s are used to examine the velocity of the FTE\nstructure moving over the Cluster formation.\n[18] Another feature associated with FTEs is the mixture\nof particles of magnetospheric and magnetosheath origin\n[Thomsen et al., 1987; Smith and Owen, 1992]. This study\ntherefore employs particle measurements taken by the CIS,\nPEACE, and RAPID instruments on board Cluster 1. For\nthe determination of the ion population, data from the Hot\nIon Analyzer (HIA, CIS-2) which is part of the CIS\nexperiment was utilized. The CIS data shown below are\nretrospectively generated spectrograms from the full three-\ndimensional ion distribution of the HIA instrument in high-\nsensitivity, solar wind, magnetospheric mode acquired over\nthree spins of the spacecraft. The electron plasma observa-\ntions have been obtained from the PEACE and RAPID\ninstruments. The PEACE instrument is designed to make\nobservations of the Cluster spacecraft low- and high-energy\nelectron environment. The observations shown below rep-\nresent the spectrum of the High Energy Electron Analyzer\n(HEEA) sensor of the PEACE instrument averaged over all\nlook directions in a temporal resolution of 4 s in an energy\nrange of 30 eV to 26 keV. The other electron measurements\nare taken from the RAPID instrument, this detector provides\nan analysis of the suprathermal plasma distribution in the\nenergy ranges from 20 to 400 keV. The data shown below\nare retrospectively generated from the observations made by\nthe Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) at 4 s resolution\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n3 of 25\nA07S22\nfrom eight different energy channels in the nine polar\ndirections of the RAPID instrument.\n2.2. Ground-Based Instrumentation\n[19] The SuperDARN system comprises a network of\nsimilar ground-based coherent-scatter radars that operate in\nthe HF band. The network of radars and their fields of views\n(FOV) cover large parts of the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere polar ionospheres. In this section we only\noutline the most important characteristics of the radar\nsystem utilized in this study and refer to Chisham et al.\n[2007] for a detailed overview of the radar system, obser-\nvational techniques and data analysis methods.\n[20] Figure 2 shows the geographical position and FOVof\nthe main radar system employed in this study in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. Overlaid in Figure 2 are the magnetic\nfootprints of the Cluster 1 spacecraft traced to 100 km\naltitude obtained from the MHD simulation runs. To high-\nlight the evolution of the footprint in time, the footprints are\ngray scale coded in time for every 5 min. The black\nnumbered solid dots indicate the footprint location at the\ntime of observed FTE features.\n[21] The Finland radar is located at Hankasalmi (62.3\u0001N,\n26.6\u0001E; it is one part of the two CUTLASS radars), like\nmost SuperDARN radars it is operated in the HF frequency\nband from 8 to 20 MHz and uses a phased array system of\nantennas to transmit HF radio pulses (commonly between\n10 and 14 MHz) into the ionosphere. The phased array\nsystems of the SuperDARN radars result in 16 virtual beams\nwithin the \u000152\u0001 FOV, with each beam subdivided into 75\nrange gates. At the time of interest, the Finland radar was\noperating with range gates of 45 km, a range to the first gate\nof 180 km and a 3 s dwell time at every beam location.\nThus, a full scan of all 16 beams was performed every 1 min\nresulting in a complete FOV coverage of over 3000 km in\nrange and a temporal resolution of 1 min. The radar\nmeasures the backscatter power from electron irregularities\nin the E and F regions of the ionosphere. Since F region\nelectron density irregularities drift at the E \u0002 B velocity, the\nionospheric motion observed by the radar represent a direct\nindicator of the motion of newly opened flux tubes.\n[22] The process can be briefly described as follows; at\nthe reconnection site magnetospheric flux tubes merge with\nthose in the magnetosheath allowing plasma flow between\nthe magnetosheath and magnetosphere. The charged par-\nticles of the plasma then gyrate down the newly opened\nmagnetic field lines while at the same time, the footprint of\nthese field lines move toward the pole due to the magnetic\ntension imposed on the field lines at the magnetopause. Since\nthe charged particles are \u2018\u2018frozen\u2019\u2019 to the magnetic field lines\nthey follow this drag motion. As a result, the E \u0002 B motion\ncan be measured by the radar systems and can be seen as so-\ncalled PMRAFs in the radar backscatter measurements.\n[23] From the backscattered signal the Doppler spectra\ncan be obtained via autocorrelation functions. This analysis\ntechnique also allows the line of sight (LOS) Doppler velocity\nof the ionospheric plasma to be derived. The FTE signatures in\nthe radar measurements can be described as transient increases\nin the LOS velocity propagating poleward.\nFigure 1. Plots showing the (left) x\u2013z and (right) x\u2013y projection of the Cluster 1 (Rumba) orbit in a\nGSM reference frame on the 14 February 2001 in the time range 0830\u20131200 UT adjacent to the\nmagnetopause. The modeled magnetopause shape [Shue et al., 1997] is shown by the solid gray lines,\nand the modeled bow shock [Bennett et al., 1997] shape is indicated by the dashed lines. The models are\nparameterized by the solar wind parameters shown in Figure 1 (left) in upper left-hand corner. The solar\nwind data are obtained from the ACE satellite and lagged by \u000155 min. The two insets show the other\nCluster spacecraft in relation to Cluster 1 at 1046 UT (time of predominant FTE observation discussed in\nsection 3); the insets show the actual tetrahedral formation and separation in km as projection onto the\nrelated planes.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n4 of 25\nA07S22\n[24] Whilst only the Northern Hemisphere is presented in\nFigure 2, conjugate observations are obtained from the\nSyowa East radar (69.0\u0001S, 39.6\u0001E) in Antarctica. In addition\nto the mesoscale (hundreds of kilometers) convection\nobservations made by the Finland and Syowa East radars,\nobservations from all available SuperDARN radars in the\nNorthern Hemisphere have been used to produce large scale\n(thousand of kilometers) convection maps of the Northern\nHemisphere ionosphere. These maps are then compared to\nthe space-based observations exploiting the MHD simula-\ntion data to achieve three-dimensional point-to-point map-\npings. The comparison is then used to show the one-to-one\ncorrelation between the space- and ground-based observa-\ntion as originally outlined by Wild et al. [2003].\n3. In Situ Observations\n[25] The study presented here focuses on the large-scale\nmodeling of a series of FTEs observed by the Cluster\nspacecraft in the high-latitude magnetopause in combination\nwith observations of the conjugate ionospheric flows made\nby HF radar systems in the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nsphere, respectively, on 14 February 2001 between 0930\nand 1100 UT. The main focus of this study is to infer the\nbehavior of the FTE structures in the regions between the\navailable measurements by using a global MHD simulation.\nThe global MHD simulation fills the gaps left by measure-\nments and allows us to establish causal relationships\nbetween the point measurements taken by the instruments.\n[26] The MHD simulation is driven by real IMF con-\nditions; therefore we shall first present the upstream IMF\nand solar wind conditions which were obtained from the\nAdvancedCompositionExplorer (ACE) satellite [McComas et\nal., 1998; Smith et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1998]. These\nupstream observations determine the inflow upstream bound-\nary conditions for the Block-Adaptive-Tree-Solarwind-Roe-\nUpwind-Scheme (BATS-R-US) MHD simulation. Second,\nwe shall present briefly the in situ field and plasma observa-\ntions drawn from the Cluster 1 spacecraft which arose from\nthe interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere,\nfollowed by highlighted features of the ground-based obser-\nvations of the ionospheric flows which subsequently arose\nfrom the FTEs seen by Cluster in the vicinity of the\nmagnetopause.\n3.1. Upstream Solar Wind Observations\n[27] The global MHD simulation is driven by real\nupstream solar wind conditions. Figure 3 presents an\noverview of the solar wind and IMF observations made\nby the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor\n(SWEPAM) and the Magnetic Field Experiment (MAG) on\nboard the ACE satellite, located some 235 RE upstream from\nthe Earth during the interval of interest. Figure 3a shows the\nsolar wind density followed by the solar wind velocity and\nmagnetic field strength components in a GSM reference\nframe. Figure 3h shows the IMF clock angle defined as\narctan(By\/Bz). During the interval of interest, the IMF was\npredominantly southward (Bz negative) and duskward (By\npositive) with a corresponding negative clock angle.\n[28] The solid black traces in Figure 3 present the ACE\nmeasurements projected to the subsolar magnetopause with\na propagation delay calculated for each measurement\n(calculated using the technique of Khan and Cowley\n[1999]; taking into account the propagation of IMF features\nwith the solar wind to the bow shock and then across the\nmagnetosheath to the magnetopause), the average of these\nlag times was \u000155 min.\n[29] The light gray traces with round markers present the\nsame measurements but propagated to 33 RE taking into\naccount the propagation of IMF features with the solar\nwind in free space which lead to an average lag time of\n\u000143 min. This propagation boundary of 33 RE represents\nthe BATS-R-US inflow upstream boundary conditions for\nthe resistive MHD equations. Themarkers represent the 1min\ntiming intervals at which the MHD run was computed. At the\nother boundaries the BATS-R-US model assumes a zero\ngradient for the plasma variables since these boundaries are\nfar enough from Earth that they have no significant effect on\nthe dynamics due to the fact that they introduce a negligible\neffect in the resistive MHD equations describing the domain.\n[30] In addition to the propagated density, shown in\nFigure 3a, also the 50% decrease of the original value (dark\ngray trace with square markers) is shown and used as a\nconstrained upstream inflow boundary condition for the\nBATS-R-US run. This 50% decrease arose from different\nsimulation runs computed with different densities varying\nfrom 100% to 30% of the original value, this was necessary\nsince a comparison of a 100% density MHD run with the\nCluster observations showed that in the simulation the GSM\nBy component turned positive earlier than indicated by the\nCluster data. This indicates that the boundary layer is pushed\nto a lower radial position as observed in the real data and that\nthe model overestimates the pressure influence.\nFigure 2. Plot showing the geographical coverage (gray\narea) of the Finland SuperDARN radar (located at\nHankasalmi 62.3\u0001N, 26.6\u0001E; part of the CUTLASS radar\nsystem) as well as the magnetic footprint of Cluster 1 at an\naltitude of 100 km. The traces were done by using the high-\nresolution MHD simulation at 5 min intervals. The\nfootprints are gray scale coded in time in accordance with\nthe key to the right. The black numbered dots represent the\nmagnetic footprint location at the time of the observed FTEs.\nThe numbers are according to the order of observation\n0945 UT (1), 0953 UT (2), 0959 UT (3), 1004 UT (4),\n1042 UT (5), and 1046 UT (6).\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n5 of 25\nA07S22\n[31] In constraining the MHD model by decreasing the\nplasma density and comparing the shape and location of\nthe resulting magnetopause with different magnetopause\nmodels [see S\u02c7afra\u00b4nkova\u00b4 et al., 2002, and references therein]\nas well as with a wide range of Cluster data (M. Denton,\nsubmitted manuscript, 2008) it was possible to constrain the\nlocation of the magnetopause boundary layer position in the\nBATS-R-US run, so that it is coincident with the Cluster\nobservation at \u00011009 UT [Daum and Wild, 2006]. The\ncomparison between the Shue et al. [1997] magnetopause\nboundary model and the constrained BATS-R-US simula-\ntion data can be seen in the following sections.\n3.2. Cluster\/SuperDARN Radar Observations\n[32] Figure 4 presents a summary of the Cluster 1\nmagnetic field and plasma measurements first discussed\nby Wild et al. [2001] as well as highlighted observational\nfeatures of the ground-based radar systems discussed by\nWild et al.

The\naverage lag time corresponds to \u000155 min as originally outlined by Wild et al. [2001].

Figure 4 (fifth panel) shows the ion\nenergy-time spectrogram obtained from the CIS instrument\nover all pitch angles. Figure 4 (sixth panel) shows the low-\nlatitude scatter measurements of the Finland and Syowa\nradars averaged over \u000174.5\u0001\u201376.0\u0001N and \u000174.5\u0001\u201376.0\u0001S\nmagnetic latitude, respectively.\n[35] The magnetic field and particle measurements clearly\nindicate the observation of four magnetospheric FTEs at\n0945 UT, 0954 UT, 0959 UT, 1004 UT, indicated in Figure 4\nby the vertical lines labeled \u2018\u2018FTE\u2019\u2019 followed by a boundary\nlayer encounter (marked as \u2018\u2018BL\u2019\u2019) at 1009 UT associated\nwith increasingly variable field and plasma observations\nwhich culminate in three magnetopause crossings (marked\nas \u2018\u2018MP\u2019\u2019) at 1017 UT, 1021 UT, and 1031 UT. Following\nthe entry of Cluster 1 into the magnetosheath at 1033 UT\nfurther FTEs were observed at 1042 UT and 1046 UT. All\nFTE observations are associated with a clear bipolar signa-\nture in the BN component and an increase of the overall field\nstrength. During the magnetospheric FTEs the ion and\nelectron energy distributions of the PEACE, CIS, and\nRAPID instruments indicated the appearance of magneto-\nsheath-like energy distributions (increasing ion flux in the\n102\u2013103 eV range and increasing electron flux in the 102\u2013\n103 eV range accompanied by the disappearance of elec-\ntrons in the 103\u2013104 eV range). The later magnetosheath\nFTE observations by the PEACE, CIS, and RAPID instru-\nments show a slight energization of the magnetosheath\nplasma and possibly (at 1046 UT) evidence for escaping\nmagnetospheric electrons in the low 250\u2013300 keV range of\nthe RAPID instrument. This characteristic mixing of mag-\nnetosheath and magnetospheric ions and electrons indicates\nthe joining of magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic\nflux tubes. This reconnection process enables magneto-\nsheath plasma to enter the magnetosphere and vice versa.\nThis effect can also be observed in the PEACE and RAPID\nFigure 4.

We\nnote that the exact nature and duration of the observations\nvaried between the FTEs.\n[36] Combining the observations in Figure 4 (first panel)\nand Figure 4 (fifth panel), it should be noted that the\nsignificant features of the FTEs became more prominent\nas the spacecraft approached the magnetopause. This is\nconsistent with the studies undertaken by Penz et al.\n[2006a, 2007], where the currently discussed FTEs have\nbeen analyzed using a novel model [Semenov et al., 2005;\nPenz et al., 2006b] which is based on the assumption of\ntime-dependent Petschek-type reconnection. By applying\nthis model to the in situ magnetic field data obtained from\nthe FGM instrument it was possible to obtain the temporal\nvariations of the reconnection field responsible for each\nFTE and subsequently also the normal and tangential\ndistances of the reconnection sites from the spacecraft. Penz\nand coworkers concluded that the FTEs observed must have\nbeen produced by reconnection sites in close proximity to\nthe Cluster formation. Furthermore, their results suggested\nthat the magnetospheric FTEs observed by Cluster, before\nthe first boundary layer encounter at 1009 UT, were\nproduced by reconnection sites at normal distances from\nthe Cluster satellites ranging from 0.9 RE (for the FTE\nobserved at 0945 UT) to 0.5 RE and 0.3 RE (for the later\nexamples) and tangential distances of \u00014.0 \u00b1 2.1 RE [Penz,\n2006]. These results are consistent with the observations\nmade by Cluster (see Figure 4) which show that the\ncharacteristic features of the FTEs became clearer as closer\nthe spacecraft were approaching the magnetopause. The\npredominant observational signatures of an FTE can be seen\nat 1046 UT in the space-based as well as in the ground-based\ninstruments. We shall therefore utilize this example to study\nmore closely the three-dimensional structure of the event.\n[37] As mentioned above, the space-based observations\nof the FTEs were accompanied by ground-based radar\nobservations in the conjugate ionospheres, a few minutes\ndelayed to the Cluster observations. Figure 4 (sixth panel)\npresents the average LOS Doppler velocities of the Finland\nradar beam 3 and Syowa East radar beam 0 averaged over\nthe low magnetic latitudes of \u000174.5\u0001\u201376.0\u0001N and \u000174.5\u0001\u2013\n76.0\u0001S, respectively. These magnetic latitudes correspond to\nthe magnetic Cluster 1 footprints shown in Figure 2 and to\nthe counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere. As discussed\nin detail by Wild et al. [2001, 2003] the averaged LOS\nDoppler velocities show a characteristic pulsing at the time\nof the observed FTEs. Typically flows peaked 1\u20132 min after\nthe \u2018\u2018center\u2019\u2019 time of the FTE observations made by the\nCluster spacecraft. These 1\u20132 min delays are expected due\nto the propagation of the plasma particles down the mag-\nnetic field lines. Indeed, given the delayed response of the\nionosphere, Wild and coworkers suggested that a one-to-one\ncorrelation between the in situ and ionospheric signatures of\nFTEs should not be expected. However, the observed\nDoppler velocities indicate a plasma flow away from the\nradar in a westward direction for the Finland radar and\neastward for the Syowa radar. These flow patterns are\nconsistent with the expected motion of newly formed\nmagnetic flux tubes connected to the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere, respectively. The open flux tubes connected to\nthe Northern Hemisphere are dragged dawnward and pole-\nward and the counterparts connected to the Southern Hemi-\nsphere are dragged duskward and poleward due to magnetic\ntension and the antisunward motion of the solar wind.\n[38] In order to put the localized observations of the\nFinland radar in a global context, we shall employ the\n\u2018\u2018map potential\u2019\u2019 technique developed by Ruohoniemi and\nBaker [1998] to produce global convection maps of the\nNorthern Hemisphere. We shall only concentrate on the\nNorthern Hemisphere here in order to link the mesoscale\nground-based observations to the Cluster observations uti-\nlizing the Cluster magnetic footprint obtained from the\nMHD model as reference. The \u2018\u2018map potential\u2019\u2019 technique\ncombines LOS velocities of multiple radar stations via a\nspherical harmonic fitting algorithm on a polar grid. At grid\npoints were no radar data is available the statistical model of\nRuohoniemi and Greenwald [1996], parameterized by IMF\nconditions, is used to stabilize the solution.\n[39] Figure 5 (left) presents dayside Northern Hemisphere\nionospheric convection maps; each averaged over 5 min at\nthe center times of the FTE observations. Overlaid on the\nconvection maps are the averaged (also over 5 min) open-\nclosed field line boundaries (OCFLBs) obtained from the\nMHD run indicated by the white\/black dashed lines and the\nCluster magnetic footprint for the times of the observed\nFTEs (compare Figure 2) indicated as the white\/black dots.\nThe instantaneous Cluster footprints were obtained using\nstreamline calculations exploiting the Cluster 1 (Rumba)\norbit location at the times of interest and the three-\ndimensional MHD data. Furthermore the FOVof the Finland\nradar is indicated as reference for the observations presented\nin Figure 4.\n[40] Since the convection maps are produced by averag-\ning the data over 5 min to compensate for limited LOS data,\nshort velocity fluctuations as presented in the Finland beam\n3 (see Figure 4, sixth panel) are smoothed out. The convec-\ntion maps are not intended to accurately represent small-scale\nfeatures; instead they provide an estimate of the general\nionospheric convection pattern and the \u2018\u2018bottom\u2019\u2019 layer of\nthe \u2018\u2018point-to-point\u2019\u2019 mapping as shown in Figure 6. Super-\nimposed on these patterns are the small-scale flow disturban-\nces due to the individual FTEs.\n[41] The gray scale-coded dots in Figure 5 (left) indicate\nlocations where radar data are available. The vectors drawn\nfrom these dots show the resultant vector of the LOS\nvelocity measurement at that location and the fitted flow\nvelocity component normal to the LOS direction at the same\nlocation. Dots and vectors are gray scale coded in accor-\ndance to the velocity magnitude, as indicated by the gray\nscale on the left-hand side. It is worth noting that in regions\nwhere radar data are unavailable, the ionospheric convec-\ntion flow estimate is only based upon the statistical patterns\nshown in the work of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald [1996].\nIn these regions, care should be taken in the interpretation of\nthe \u2018\u2018map-potential\u2019\u2019 solution (we shall return to this fact\nlater in the modeling section).\n[42] As shown only limited radar data are available and\nmainly localized dawnward and at lower latitudes than the\nCluster footprint. Owing to the insufficient radar data\navailable, the general convection patterns shall be shown\nhere only for completeness but shall not be used for\ncomparisons since they are mainly based upon the statistical\npatterns and do not incorporate the fluctuation due to the\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n8 of 25\nA07S22\nFTEs. This is especially evident comparing the convection\npatterns of 0954 UT with 1045 UT, since under similar\nIMF conditions but with more radar data available the\nthroat region shifts by over one hour of MLT in duskward\ndirection.\n[43] The convection maps in Figure 5 (left) show that for\nthe times of the FTEs the ionospheric flows in the prenoon\nFigure 5\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n9 of 25\nA07S22\nto postnoon sector from \u000110\u201318 MLT and between 70\u0001\u2013\n80\u0001N MLAT were predominantly westward, with iono-\nspheric plasma moving from later MLTs to earlier ones\nand turning poleward as indicated in the western and middle\nportion of the Finland radar FOVwith flow speeds exceeding\n1000 ms\u00031.\n[44] Despite the limited backscatter in the Northern\nHemisphere ionosphere, the flows in regions where radar\ndata are available show a general consistency with infer-\nences regarding the motion of flux tube footprints in terms\nof their location [Crooker and Siscoe, 1990; Toffoletto et al.,\n1990] and theoretical predictions of expected flow patterns\n[Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. We shall return to the\nlocalization of the flow patterns and their associated flux\ntube footprint motion later in the modeling section.\n[45] The LOS velocity features discussed are especially\nprominent dawnward of the location of the Cluster 1\nmagnetic footprint, here the radar data clearly indicate a\nwestward and poleward motion of the ionospheric plasma.\nWild et al. [2003] performed a comparison of the Northern\nand Southern Hemisphere for the times of interest. The\nanalyses of the Southern Hemisphere ionospheric convec-\ntion maps showed exclusively eastward and poleward flows\nbetween 75\u0001\u201380\u0001S MLAT with ionospheric plasma moving\nfrom earlier to later MLTs. Wild et al. [2003] concluded\nfrom the convection map comparison that the observed\nionospheric flow patterns in the prenoon and postnoon\nsector must have been caused by the motion of newly\nopened flux tubes produced by either an X-line extending\nover several hours of local time (at least 4 h) or multiple\nreconnection sites separated in azimuth by a similar dis-\nplacement.\n[46] The simultaneous Cluster and SuperDARN radar\nobservations can be schematically summarized in Figure 6\n(assuming a reconnection site located equatorward of the\nCluster spacecraft). The Cluster in situ measurements of\nthe magnetic field and the plasma perturbations caused by the\nnewly opened flux tube motion form the \u2018\u2018top layer\u2019\u2019 of the\npoint-to-point mapping, and the SuperDARN radar observa-\ntions represent the conjugate ionospheric responses of the\nflux tube footprint motion forming the \u2018\u2018bottom layer.\u2019\u2019\n[47] Following reconnection on the dayside magneto-\npause (as schematically indicated in Figure 6), the newly\nopened flux tubes are dragged over the magnetopause due\nto the combination of magnetic field tension and the\nantisunward motion of the solar wind (the motion is\nindicated by the light gray arrow in Figure 6), the resulting\nplasma and field perturbations can be seen in the Cluster 1\nin situ observations (see Figure 4). The flux tubes whose\nfootprints are connected to the Northern Hemisphere can be\ntracked by the SuperDARN radars by observing electron\nirregularities in the conjugate ionosphere which are E \u0002 B\ndrifting with the newly opened flux tubes. These perturba-\ntions are manifested as westward and poleward plasma\nflows. We shall return to this \u2018\u2018top-bottom\u2019\u2019-layer view later\nin the modeling section.\n[48] To place the localized Cluster and SuperDARN\nobservations into a global context as indicated in Figure 6,\nit is necessary to perform a global simulation of the\ngeospace environment focusing on (1) the global field line\ntopology of the FTE flux tubes, (2) determination of the\nlocation of the reconnection X-line\/s, (3) the evolution of\nFigure 6. Schematic indicating the idealized magnetic\nfield topology after reconnection has taken place. The solid\nblack lines indicate a magnetic field line after reconnection\ntook place in two time steps. The motion of this field line is\nassociated with plasma and field perturbations which can be\nseen by the Cluster spacecraft (the location of the Cluster\ntetrahedron is indicated by the spacecraft symbol). The black\narrows indicate the plasma propagation along the newly\nreconnected magnetic field line down to the ionosphere. The\nfootprint motion can then be seen in the FOVs of the\nSuperDARN radars indicated as light gray shapes on\nthe ground and can be pinpointed using several SuperDARN\nradars.\nFigure 5. (left) The streamlines and vectors of the ionospheric flows derived from the SuperDARN velocity\nmeasurements in the dayside Northern Hemisphere and obtained from the \u2018\u2018map potential\u2019\u2019 technique described by\nRuohoniemi and Baker [1998] averaged over 5 min at the times of the FTEs. The velocity flow vectors are scaled and gray\nscale coded to indicate flow speeds as described in the key to the left.

Models\n[49] By employing a global MHD simulation in combi-\nnation with space- and ground-based observations, it is\npossible to estimate the large-scale spatial characteristics\nof the observed FTEs (within the boundaries of the model-\ning precision). In order to study also the temporal evolution,\nwe have employed a realistic flux tube motion model based\non that of Cooling et al. [2001] (subsequently referred to as\nthe \u2018\u2018Cooling model\u2019\u2019). Utilizing these models we are able\nto track the motion of the newly opened flux tubes across\nthe magnetopause and, based on this information, we are\nable to model the three-dimensional topology of the mag-\nnetic field at the times of the FTEs.\n[50] The correlation of the models and the measurements\nwas undertaken by using VisAn MHD (http:\/\/www.visan.\nnet.ms) [Daum, 2007] which allowed a direct analysis and\nvisualization of the correlations. VisAn MHD is a Matlab\ntoolbox developed at Lancaster University, it is designed to\nprovide users with an easy to use analysis and visualization\ntool for the various numerical models available to the\ncommunity. VisAn MHD follows the first generation of\nstandardized software tools (cf. CISM-DX) [Wiltberger et\nal., 2005, and references therein] which allows users to\nemploy various sophisticated numerical models in their\nstudies by using standardized widely known syntax struc-\ntures. This feature allows these tools to be widely used in\ndifferent communities. VisAn MHD is released under the\nGNU General Public license (GNU GPL) and freely avail-\nable to the different research communities.\n4.1. Global MHD Model (BATS-R-US)\n[51] In this study we use the BATS-R-US MHD code\n[Powell et al., 1999] which was originally developed by the\nComputational MHD Group at the University of Michigan,\nnow Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM:\nhttp:\/\/csem.engin.umich.edu). The code used in this study\nis version 7.73 which is part of the Space Weather Modeling\nFramework (SWMF) described by To\u00b4th et al. [2005]. The\nBATS-R-US code solves three-dimensional MHD equations\nin a finite volume form using numerical methods related to\nRoe\u2019s Approximate Riemann Solver [Roe, 1981]. The code\ntherefore utilizes an adaptive grid composed of rectangular\nblocks arranged in varying degrees of spatial refinement levels.\nA detailed description of the model and the numerical\/\nparallel implementation can be found in the work of Gombosi\net al. [2003].\n[52] The BATS-R-US code executed within the SWMF is\ncoupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) which\nrepresents the inner and middle magnetosphere with cou-\npling to the ionosphere [Toffoletto et al., 2003]. The RCM\nrepresents the particles in terms of multiple fluids. Its\nequations and numerical methods have been specifically\ndesigned for an accurate treatment of the inner magneto-\nsphere, including the flow of electric currents along mag-\nnetic field lines to and from the conducting ionosphere. The\nRCM computes these currents and the associated electric\nfields self-consistently. It assumes perfectly conducting field\nlines and employs a precomputed time-dependent magnetic\nfield with associated induction electric fields. The Vasyliu-\nnas equation [Vasyliunas, 1970] is used to compute the\nmagnetic-field-aligned currents (Birkeland currents), and\nOhm\u2019s law is used to compute the self-consistent iono-\nspheric potential distribution. A detailed description of the\nBATS-R-US\/RCM coupling can be found in the work of\nDe Zeeuw et al. [2004].\n[53] The model employed here is the BATS-R-US model\nincluded in the SWMF version 2. Initial runs have been\nperformed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center\n(CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC);\nruns under the SWMF version 2.3 have been recently\nperformed on the Lancaster High Performance Cluster and\nshowed equivalent results. In both sets of runs we have\nhalved the observed solar wind density to obtain reasonable\nmagnetopause locations, consistent with the in situ measure-\nments from Cluster. The model runs were executed with a\n0.25 RE (\u00011600 km) resolution in the near-tail and dayside\nmagnetopause region and a 0.0625 RE (\u0001400 km) resolu-\ntion in the cusp region close to the Cluster position (cf.\nFigure 2). The adaptive nonuniform numerical grid was\nthen interpolated onto an uniform regular cartesian grid with\na resolution of 0.1 RE (\u0001640 km) inside a bounding box of\n\u000330 to 15 RE in the x direction and \u00b115 RE in the y and z\ndirections, respectively. The simulation was implemented\nwith real time-dependent upstream inflow conditions\nobtained from the instruments on board the ACE satellite\n(cf. Figure 3). The magnetic equatorial strength of the\nEarth\u2019s dipole field was set to \u000331,100 nT (default for\nthe SWMF in the predefined jPLANET j command), while\nthe orientation of the magnetic field was updated in real\ntime.\n[54] The ionospheric conduction model included in the\nSWMF run is the Ridley ionosphere model based on the\nwork of Ridley and Liemohn [2002] and Ridley et al.\n[2004]. It is a two-dimensional electrostatic potential solver\nthat obtains the field-aligned currents from the global\nmagnetosphere (GM) module included in the SWMF and\nemploys a statistical auroral ionosphere conductance model\ndriven by the solar irradiation index (F10.7) and by the\nfield-aligned current patterns. From the different models\nincluded in the SWMF it is possible to retrieve a wide range\nof output parameters from the different regions of interest.\nThe model outputs include the plasma parameters (atomic\nmass unit density n; kinetic pressure p; velocity vx, vy, vz),\nthe magnetic field components Bx, By, Bz, and the electric\ncurrent components jx, jy, jz. As a byproduct of the RCM-\nRidley coupling the ionospheric electrodynamic parameters\n(electric potential F; Hall and Pedersen conductance SH,\nSP) and the ionospheric electric current density J can be\nobtained. The wide range of parameters allows us to model\nthe features of the FTEs on a global scale without the\nlimitations and boundary restrictions of an empirical model.\n4.2. Open Flux Tube Motion Model (Cooling Model)\n[55] In order to be able to study the temporal evolution of\nthe FTEs we employ the Cooling model [Cooling et al.,\n2001]. While a detailed description of this model is not\nappropriate here, we shall outline the basic elements of the\nsimple implementation used in this study. The Cooling\nmodel itself is an evolution of the model by Cowley and\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n11 of 25\nA07S22\nF\nig\nu\nre\n7\n.\nT\nh\ne\nfi\nel\nd\n-a\nli\ng\nn\ned\ncu\nrr\nen\nt\nd\nen\nsi\nty\nin\nth\ne\nG\nS\nM\ny\n\u2013\nz-\np\nla\nn\ne\nat\nth\ne\nz\np\no\nsi\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nC\nlu\nst\ner\n1\n,\nfo\nr\nth\ne\nti\nm\nes\no\nf\nth\ne\nm\nag\nn\net\no\nsp\nh\ner\nic\nF\nT\nE\ns\n(s\nee\nF\nig\nu\nre\n4\n;\n0\n9\n4\n5\nU\nT\n,\n0\n9\n5\n4\nU\nT\n,\n0\n9\n5\n9\nU\nT\n,\n1\n0\n0\n4\nU\nT\n).\nT\nh\ne\nel\nec\ntr\nic\ncu\nrr\nen\nt\nd\nen\nsi\nty\nis\nco\nlo\nr\nco\nd\ned\nas\nin\nd\nic\nat\ned\nin\nth\ne\nk\ney\ns\nto\nth\ne\nri\ng\nh\nt\no\nf\nea\nch\nfr\nam\ne.\nO\nv\ner\nla\nid\no\nn\nea\nch\nfr\nam\ne\nis\nth\ne\nC\nlu\nst\ner\n1\no\nrb\nit\np\nro\nje\nct\nio\nn\nin\nth\ne\nco\nrr\nes\np\no\nn\nd\nin\ng\nre\nfe\nre\nn\nce\nfr\nam\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nw\nh\nit\ne\/\nb\nla\nck\nd\nas\nh\ned\nli\nn\nes\nin\nd\nic\nat\ne\nth\ne\nin\nn\ner\nm\nag\nn\net\no\np\nau\nse\nb\no\nu\nn\nd\nar\ny\naf\nte\nr\nS\nh\nu\ne\net\na\nl.\n[1\n9\n9\n7\n]\np\nar\nam\net\ner\niz\ned\nb\ny\nth\ne\nIM\nF\np\nar\nam\net\ner\ns\nsh\no\nw\nn\nin\nth\ne\nu\np\np\ner\nri\ng\nh\nt-\nh\nan\nd\nco\nrn\ner\no\nf\nea\nch\nfr\nam\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nin\nse\nts\no\nf\nea\nch\nfr\nam\ne\nsh\no\nw\nth\ne\nfi\nel\nd\n-a\nli\ng\nn\ned\nel\nec\ntr\nic\ncu\nrr\nen\nt\nd\nen\nsi\nti\nes\no\nb\nta\nin\ned\nfr\no\nm\nth\ne\ncu\nrl\no\nm\net\ner\nte\nch\nn\niq\nu\ne\n[D\nu\nn\nlo\np\net\na\nl.\n,\n1\n9\n8\n8\n]\nex\np\nlo\nit\nin\ng\nth\ne\nF\nG\nM\nd\nat\na\nfr\no\nm\nal\nl\nfo\nu\nr\nsp\nac\nec\nra\nft\nat\n4\ns\nre\nso\nlu\nti\no\nn\n.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n12 of 25\nA07S22\nOwen [1989], it considers the draping and strength of the\nmagnetosheath magnetic field, the magnetosheath flow\nvelocity, and the density over the surface of a simple\nparabolic magnetopause [Kobel and Flu\u00a8ckiger, 1994;\nSpreiter et al., 1966] in order to evaluate the velocity of\nthe point where the newly reconnected flux tubes thread the\nmodeled magnetopause. This calculated instantaneous\nvelocity is the velocity of the rest frame of a reconnected\nfield line, the so-called de Hoffmann-Teller frame [De\nHoffmann and Teller, 1950], in which the electric field\ntransforms to zero. On the basis of this rest frame velocity\nand the simple linear relationship between the magneto-\nsheath velocity, the magnetic field direction and the Alfve\u00b4n\nspeed derived by Cowley and Owen [1989], the Cooling\nmodel calculates the de Hoffmann-Teller velocities of the\nflux tubes connected to the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nsphere, respectively.\n[56] From these velocities, the motion of the points at\nwhich the open magnetic flux tubes thread the magneto-\npause can be traced via iteration over the surface of the\ndayside magnetopause from any location on the surface of\nthe magnetopause. In the applied model, we are therefore\nable to monitor the subsequent motion of the newly recon-\nnected flux tubes (i.e., FTEs) away from the defined X-line\n(characterized by the locus of 180\u0001 shear).\n[57] This allows us to use the simple Cooling model\ncalculations (i.e., the computed points tracing the motion\nof open flux tubes across the surface of the magnetopause)\nas start points for field line traces using the fully three-\ndimensional MHD simulation data. The MHD \u2018\u2018snapshots\u2019\u2019\nof the magnetic field line topology following reconnection\nare then used to ascertain the structure and evolution of the\nobserved FTEs.\n[58] This combination of a global model and a motion\nmodel allows us to get a deeper insight into the global\ndynamics especially since the Cooling model was used in\nprevious observational studies to characterize the large-scale\nmotion of FTEs in combination with space- and ground-\nbased observations [e.g., Dunlop et al., 2005; Wild et al.,\n2005, 2007] we are confident in the combination of the two\nmodels as described further down. Also the combination\nrepresents a further validation method for the MHD model\ncomparison.\n5. Model Results\n[59] The simultaneous observations of FTE signatures by\nthe space- and ground-based instruments discussed above\nshall now be put into a global context using the BATS-R-US\nMHD code in combination with the Cooling model. The\npresented combination analysis technique was first pre-\nsented by Daum and Wild [2006] and a similar approach\nwill be employed here.\n[60] We shall first consider particular observational fea-\ntures and compare them to the modeled results before we\nput the individual comparisons in a global context. First, we\nshall consider the location of the reconnection site(s) on the\ndayside magnetopause in the model. Wild et al. [2003]\npointed out that a decision between either an X-line extend-\ning over many hours of local time (at least 4 h) or multiple\nreconnection sites separated in azimuth by a similar dis-\nplacement is difficult to make based on the observations\nalone. In order to revisit this uncertainty, we have simulated\nthe predominant time of interest from 0930 to 1100 UT on\nthe 14 February 2001 using the BATS-R-US global MHD\ncode. The inflow boundary conditions for the run are shown\nin Figure 3 and the model was computed with a grid\nresolution as described above.\n[61] In order to identify the probable location and spatial\ndimension of the reconnection site(s) responsible for the\nobserved FTE signatures we shall first investigate the field-\naligned currents (jk) adjacent to the magnetopause. As\nindicated by Crooker and Siscoe [1990], Russell and Elphic\ntype FTEs and their associated reconnection sites can be\nidentified as patches of open field lines on an otherwise\nclosed magnetopause. These \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 in the Chapman-\nFerraro magnetopause, and the associated current systems\nwhich emanate from these \u2018\u2018holes,\u2019\u2019 result in an increased\nelectric current density parallel to the magnetic field.\nSince these \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 are a feature of the reconnection\nprocess involved in the forming of FTEs, the conclusion\nmade by Crooker and Siscoe [1990] can also be widened\nto non Russell and Elphic type FTE models. Therefore, in\nthe simulations, we can associate enhanced current\ndensity patches with magnetic reconnection sites at the\nmagnetopause.\n[62] Figure 7 shows the modeled field-aligned current\ndensity in the GSM x\u2013y plane at the z position of Cluster 1.\nTo aid the eye, model magnetopause boundaries after Shue\net al. [1997] are overlaid on the projections, indicated by the\nwhite\/black dashed lines and parameterized by the solar\nwind conditions as indicated in the upper right hand corner\nof each frame. Here it should be mentioned, that the\nmagnetopause boundary after Shue et al. [1997] is only\nshown as an indicator for the boundary and not to accurately\ndescribe the MHD model boundary.\n[63] The current sheet slices show well-defined patches of\nincreased electric current density of 10\u201320 \u0002 10\u00034 mAm\u00032\nin an area of 4 < x < 7 and 4 < y < 8 RE adjacent to the\nmodeled [Shue et al., 1997] magnetopause. These patches\ncorrespond to the reconnection processes indicated by the\nobservations. In the simulation these patches propagate in\nantisunward direction around the magnetopause. It can be\nseen for further time steps in the MHD simulation, that the\npatches (identified by the field-aligned current strength)\nhave moved downtail along the magnetopause by several\nEarth radii and that the field-aligned current strength at the\nformer x, y location has decreased. Owing to the 1-min\nresolution of the MHD simulation these patches (at the\nformer x, y location as shown in Figure 7) disappear after\none to three \u2018\u2018snapshots\u2019\u2019 after the FTE observations. This\ncorresponds to the time frames given by Penz et al. [2007]\nof reconnection bursts lasting about 2.6 \u00b1 0.9 min.\n[64] The insets of Figure 7 show the field-aligned electric\ncurrent density at 4 s resolution exploiting FGM data from\nall four spacecraft using the so-called curlometer technique\n[Dunlop et al., 1988]. The field-aligned current densities\nshow that at the \u2018\u2018center\u2019\u2019 times of the FTEs a defined\nstructure is passing over the position of Cluster which can\nbe identified by the peaks lasting about 30 s. From the full\nresolution FGM data at 64 vectors\/s it can be inferred that\nthese structures are passing over the spacecraft formation\nwith a velocity of approximately 96 km\/s. In comparison\nwith the electric current density slices from the MHD model\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n13 of 25\nA07S22\nFigure 8\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n14 of 25\nA07S22\nthese values show a good correlation. The time of the MHD\nmodel slice is thereby indicated by the vertical red line in\nthe insets. Owing to the 1-min resolution in the MHD model\nthese short-time fluctuations can not be reproduced.\n[65] Assuming that jk enhancements at the magnetopause\nare a proxy for reconnection, we can conclude from\nthe model results that the reconnection site\/s seen in the\nsimulation data are localized at the postnoon sector of the\nmagnetopause and extend over at least \u00013.5 h MLT in close\nvicinity of the modeled magnetopause in a narrow band of 1\nRE (for the GSM x\u2013y plane at the z position of Cluster 1;\nsee Figure 7). The MHD model therefore shows a bias\ntoward an antiparallel merging scheme as described by\nCrooker [1979] and Luhmann et al. [1984]. This bias is\noften seen in MHD simulations [e.g., Ogino et al., 1986;\nBerchem et al., 1995; Fedder et al., 2002; Park et al., 2006]\nespecially with a strong By \u0006 0 component of the IMF and\na nonzero dipole tilt present.\n[66] The modeled results shown in Figure 7 also agree\nwith the studies undertaken by Penz et al. [2006a, 2007]\nwhich reported that the reconnection processes responsible\nfor the FTEs were located at a distance of \u00011.4 RE (normal)\nalong the magnetopause from the Cluster spacecraft posi-\ntion. The enhanced field-aligned current patches in Figure 7\nshow a close correlation with these predicted distances.\n[67] To ascertain further whether antiparallel merging\n[Crooker, 1979; Luhmann et al., 1984] or component\nmerging [Sonnerup, 1970, 1974; Cowley, 1973, 1976;\nGonzales and Mozer, 1974] is predicted by the MHD\nmodel, we have derived the plasma beta parameter (b =\np\/(jBj2\/2m0)) in the GSM y\u2013z-plane at the x-location of\nCluster for the times of the magnetospheric FTEs, see\nFigure 8 (left). A highly structured plasma beta component\nin the models high-latitude magnetopause region would\nsuggest anti-parallel merging as indicated by Fedder et al.\n[2002] and Berchem et al. [2008].\n[68] In Figure 8 (left) it can be seen, that two regions of\nhigh plasma beta (b \u0006 10) can be clearly distinguished in\nthe Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Following the\ndescription in the work of Berchem et al. [2008] the\nMHD model predicts antiparallel merging with two recon-\nnection sites with a comparable azimuth displacement in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. This\nwould also agree with a recent modeling study undertaken\nby Park et al. [2006]. This study showed that under Bz < 0\nand By > 0 IMF conditions, and a nonzero dipole tilt,\nantiparallel merging in the high latitudes is dominant over\ncomponent merging. As shown by recent observational\nstudies [e.g., Sandholt et al., 2004; Massetti, 2006; Trattner\net al., 2006], such a clear characterization cannot be seen in\nthe observations. Observations of the magnetosphere in\ncombination with the conjugate ionospheres led these\nauthors to conclude that it is most likely that the signatures\nobserved are actuated by a \u2018\u2018mixed\u2019\u2019 reconnection topology,\nresulting from a superposition of antiparallel reconnection at\nhigh latitudes and component merging in the subsolar\nregions. Also it is worth noting that the presented ground-\nand space-based observations do not favor either of the\nmerging concepts.\n[69] Following Park et al. [2006] characterizations and\nthe indications given by the plasma beta parameter derived\nfrom the model, we follow the antiparallel merging topol-\nogy for the further analysis. Nevertheless it should be\nmentioned here that the antiparallel merging topology as\nindicated by the MHD model run is dependent upon the\nresistivity model used in the simulation as outlined recently\nby Berchem and Richard [2007]. Berchem and Richard\n[2007] stated that the merging line grows with resistivity.\nTherefore it could be that no component merging is seen in\nthe presented simulation due to insufficient resistivity. Since\nneither the observations nor the models favor either the\nantiparallel nor component merging description, we follow\nthe characterization of Park et al. [2006] in favor of\nantiparallel merging.\n[70] The next step of the analysis is to evaluate the\nevolution of the flux tubes opened at the reconnection sites\nand the general field line topology. Consequently, we have\nemployed the Cooling model to study the motion and large-\nscale structure of the newly reconnected field lines. The\nCooling model considers pairs of open reconnected field\nlines which are initiated along a model reconnection site\n(locus of 180\u0001 shear). The Cooling model only considers the\nFTE motion due to the j \u0002 B force and the magnetosheath\nflow, therefore each of the pairs of reconnected field lines\ncan be treated as individual points of reconnection. In order\nto make the MHD model and the Cooling model compara-\nble, we have modified the Cooling model\u2019s magnetopause\nstandoff distance to coincide with that of the MHD model.\nOwing to the Cluster in situ observations shown in Figure 4\nand the discussions about the northern cusp location in the\nwork of Wild et al. [2001, 2003] and Wilken et al. [2001],\nwe have also modified the location of the cusp singularities\nin the Cooling model. Usually, the cusps are located on the\nmagnetopause surface, at GSM y = 0 and an x position\nmidway between the magnetopause nose standoff distance\nand x = 0. In this case, we have simply rotated the line\nFigure 8.

[2007] in which the\naccuracy of the Cooling model was compared with Cluster\nmeasurements, we are confident in the overall mapping\nbetween the Cooling model traces and the MHD model data\nto investigate the global structure and evolution of the\npresented FTEs. It should be noted here that a direct\nmatching between the two models will never be achieved,\nsince the Cooling model only includes a very basic mag-\nnetosheath model and no dipole tilt but the study by Fear\nand coworkers showed that under predominantly southward\nIMF or a dominant By component of the IMF, the FTE\nvelocity predictions matched the Cluster observations rea-\nsonably well. The open flux tube traces derived from the\nCooling model will therefore provide well-defined starting\npoints for the mapping process between the FTE motion\nacross the high-latitude magnetopause and the conjugate\nionosphere exploiting the high-resolution MHD data.\n[72] Figure 8 (right) shows the results of the Cooling\nmodel runs for an antiparallel merging line in the high-\nlatitude magnetopause in close vicinity to the Cluster\nformation as well as the counterpart merging line in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The results shown in Figure 8 are\nprojected onto the GSM y\u2013z-plane looking earthward from\nthe Sun. The concentric dashed circles indicate the shape of\nthe modeled magnetopause in 5 RE intervals along the x\ndirection. The IMF clock angle for the simulation runs are\nshown in the insets in the upper right-hand corner of each\nframe. The solar wind speed used as an input to the model is\ntaken from the ACE solar wind observations shown in\nFigure 3.\n[73] The position of Cluster is marked as a black dot in\nthe high-latitude postnoon sector at x \u0001 5.5 RE, y \u0001 3.5 RE,\nand z \u0001 9.8 RE. The solid black lines indicate the most\nlikely X-line locations derived from the magnetic shears\n(locus of 180\u0001 shear) and the corresponding magnetopause\ncurrents. As noted above, the X-line\/s should be seen as the\ngeneral locations of the multiple reconnection sites from\nwhich the FTEs emerged. The Cooling model assumes the\ncusps to be point singularities, the locations are marked by\nthe diamonds. The dashed lines originating from the merg-\ning line\/s represent the pairs of open reconnected flux tubes\nconnected to the Northern (dark gray) and Southern (light\ngray) Hemispheres, respectively. We note that in this case,\nall newly opened flux tubes move antisunward. As such, at\nthe Northern Hemisphere X-line newly opened flux tubes\nconnected to the Southern Hemisphere are dragged pole-\nward and tailward across the X-line, suggesting that steady\nreconnection at this location is impossible [Cowley and\nOwen, 1989; Cooling et al., 2001]. The same is true at the\nX-line in the vicinity of the southern cusp.\n[74] Concentrating on the flux tubes connected to the\nNorthern Hemisphere (cf. Figure 8 (right); dark gray dashed\nlines) at the position of the Cluster spacecraft, the general\nmotion can be identified as predominantly poleward and\nsomewhat dawnward along the magnetopause. This motion\nresults from the antisunward motion of the solar wind and\nthe j \u0002 B magnetic tension force acting upon the curved,\nnewly reconnected field lines. The expected motion of these\nflux tube footprints in the conjugate Northern Hemisphere\nionosphere is therefore expected to be westward and pole-\nward. Wild et al. [2001, 2003] have shown comparable\nmotions seen in the flow patterns of the SuperDARN radar\nsystems (see Figure 5, left).\n[75] On the basis of the open flux tube traces provided by\nthe Cooling model in the Northern Hemisphere, we have\ncomputed the three-dimensional point-to-point mappings\nbetween the flux tube traces and the conjugate ionosphere\nat an altitude of 100 km (see Figure 9) exploiting the three-\ndimensional magnetic field data of the MHD simulation to\nperform the streamline tracing calculations. Figure 9\npresents the large-scale three-dimensional magnetic field\nline topology of this Cooling-BATS-R-US mapping process\nat the times of the FTEs. The light gray lines represent\nMHD-derived magnetic field lines that pass through the\ntraces given by the Cooling model. The traces are indicated\nby the blue (connected to the Northern Hemisphere) and red\nlines (connected to the Southern Hemisphere). The contour\nslices represent the logarithmic kinetic pressure of the MHD\nmodel on the uniform regular cartesian grid with a resolu-\ntion of 0.1 RE (\u0001640 km) gray scale coded in accordance\nwith the key to the right of each frame. Overlaid in the GSM\nx\u2013y and GSM x\u2013z-plane are the inner magnetopause bound-\naries after Shue et al. [1997] parameterized with the param-\neters to the top of each frame (cf. parameters Figure 7).\n[76] The field topologies exhibit a clearly open-closed\nfield line structure. The field lines in close proximity to the\nCluster location (x \u0001 5.3 RE, y \u0001 3.6 RE, and z \u0001 9.8 RE;\ncf. Figure 8) reveal an L-shaped curved structure. The\ncomparison of Figures 7 (field-aligned currents), 8 (Cooling\ntraces), and 9 (3-D Cooling-BATS-R-US mapping) reveals\nthat the field lines at higher latitudes above the reconnection\nsites (z > 10 RE; reconnection sites are indicated in Figure 7,\nthey are slightly higher than the ones given by the Cooling\ncomputations) have an open field line topology with their\ndirection mainly influenced by the clock angle of the IMF.\nThe field lines at lower latitudes than the reconnection sites\n(z < 10 RE) show a closed field line topology but are\ndeformed and stretched toward the points of reconnection.\nFollowing the open magnetic field lines from the ionosphere\nto the high-latitude magnetopause the field lines perform at\nfirst a \u2018\u2018right turn\u2019\u2019 and then a sharp \u2018\u2018left turn\u2019\u2019 toward\ndawn. After the turns the field lines are stretched around the\nmagnetopause. These magnetic field line perturbations and\nthe associated plasma perturbations correspond to the\nobservation of the FTE features as postulated first by\nRussell and Elphic [1978] and Dubinin et al. [1980] and\nshown in Figure 4. The field line perturbations shown in\nFigure 9 are closely related to the merging line which is\nshown in the Cooling computations (cf. Figure 8 (right)).\n[77] We note that the FTEs at 0945 UT, 0954 UT, and\n1004 UT emanated from reconnection sites which occurred\nunder similar negative clock angles (cf. Figure 3h), whereas\nat 0959 UT the clock angle was predominant northward.\nStudying the field line topologies for the cases of southward\nIMF more carefully, we notice that the separation of the\nopen and closed field line topology is coincident with the\nlocation of the increased patches of parallel electric current\ndensities as shown in Figure 7 but with a slightly higher\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n17 of 25\nA07S22\noffset from the presumable reconnection site (\u00010.2\u20131.0 RE)\nthan the Cooling merging line. This indicates that at these\nlocations reconnection has taken place and that the \u2018\u2018snap-\nshots\u2019\u2019 in Figure 9 show the newly reconnected field lines in\na time instance after reconnection took place.\n[78] In contradiction to Fedder et al. [2002] the field line\ntopologies and the associated FTEs presented here have\ncaused a localized enhancement of the field-aligned currents\nas seen in Figure 7. This leads us to believe that the current\ninfluences might also be seen in the conjugate ionospheres,\nas indicated by Wild et al. [2001, 2003]. In order to\ninvestigate the evolution and influence of the FTE structures\nin the conjugate ionosphere, we have mapped the magnetic\nfield line topology shown in Figure 9 down to an altitude of\n100 km in the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere. The result\nof the mapping process is shown in Figure 5 (right) as solid\nblack lines on a magnetic local time grid. The traces are\noverlaid on the Ridley electric current densities obtained\nfrom the SWMF Ridley ionosphere module. For compari-\nson to Figure 5 (right) the FOV of the Finland radar, the\nOCFLB (white\/black dashed line) and the Cluster 1 foot-\nprint (white\/black dot) are overlaid.\n[79] Studying the electric current density in Figure 5\n(right), we note that in a narrow band between \u000172\u2013\n80\u0001N MLAT enhanced patches of electric current density\nare evident, generally coaligned with the OCFLB. These\npatches can be associated with the increased patches of\nfield-aligned currents at the high-latitude magnetopause as\npresented in Figure 7. The ionospheric currents arise in\nresponse to the ionospheric drag on the flux tubes convect-\ning in antisunward direction along the magnetopause. These\nelongated patches in the ionosphere are the footprints of the\nmagnetopause \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 associated with the FTEs [Lundin\nand Evans, 1985]. Crooker and Siscoe [1990] postulated for\nRussell and Elphic type FTEs, that the FTEs map as\nelongated \u2018\u2018teardrop\u2019\u2019 shaped patches into the ionosphere.\nFurthermore, they showed that the upward current from the\nelongated end of the footprint flows to the edge of the\nmagnetopause \u2018\u2018hole\u2019\u2019 furthest from the cusp, crosses\nthe hole against the Chapman-Ferraro current, decreases\nthe shielding there, and returns to the ionosphere along the\nfield lines from the near-cusp edge of the \u2018\u2018hole\u2019\u2019; this is\nillustrated in Figure 10. As indicated above, the \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 in\nthe Chapman-Ferro magnetopause are not just characteristic\nfor Russell and Elphic type FTEs and it should be noted\nhere that longer structures passing through the \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019\nwould most likely also have elongated current responses\nin the conjugate ionosphere as described in various obser-\nvational and modeling studies [e.g., Saunders, 1989;\nGlassmeier and Stellmacher, 1996; McWilliams et al.,\n2001; Pitout and Blelly, 2003].\n[80] Following Crooker and Siscoe\u2019s illustration, the\nseveral \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 of the magnetopause presented in Figure 7\nare also expected to have elongated footprints in the conju-\ngate ionosphere. These footprints are partially reproduced\nby the model and can be seen in Figure 5 (right) as\nelongated patches of enhanced electric current densities in\nthe early afternoon sector as first indicated by Meng and\nLundin [1986] and Crooker and Siscoe [1990] in their\nobservation of auroral arc forms in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere. The authors describe these forms as \u2018\u2018fan-shaped\u2019\u2019\narc structures that focus toward the cusp.\n[81] We shall further examine the magnetic footprints\nassociated with the location of newly opened flux tubes\non the magnetopause that pass in close proximity to the\nCluster spacecraft (indicated by solid black lines in Figure 5,\nright). The footprints in general show a straight path away\nfrom the radar covering \u000130\u201360 min MLT from later MLTs\nto earlier ones following from lower to higher magnetic\nlatitudes. These paths are consistent with the general flow\nobservations made by the SuperDARN radar. This leads us\nto conclude that the footprints indicate a westward and\npoleward motion of the newly opened flux tubes across the\nNorthern Hemisphere ionosphere.\n[82] As discussed in section 3.2 (Cluster\/SuperDARN\nobservations), due to very limited radar measurements, not\nall of the ionospheric Cooling-BATS-R-US traces are colo-\ncated with ionospheric observations. Outside of these\nregions, the estimated convection pattern should be treated\nwith caution since, due to the lack of measurements, these\npatterns are only constrained by a statistical convection\nmodel parameterized by the general IMF conditions. We\nshall therefore only concentrate our further comparisons on\nthe times where actual LOS data are available for the areas\nof the traces, these times are 0945 UT (weak coverage) and\n1045 UT (good coverage). Concentrating first on the\n09:45 UT convection map (Figure 5, left) the Doppler\nvelocities presented as gray scale coded dots and vectors\nin the dusk part of the Finland radar at about 1300 MLT\nshow a strong westward (lower magnetic latitudes) and\npoleward (higher magnetic latitudes) component with veloc-\nities of \u00011000 ms\u00031. In the vicinity of the Cluster footprint\n(where radar data exist and can be compared to the in situ\nFTE observations), the LOS velocities and convection\nstreamlines are in reasonable agreement with the traces\nobtained from the Cooling\u2013BATS-R-US mapping. In the\nhigher-latitude region starting from 73\u0001N MLAT the estimat-\nFigure 10.

The\nsolid and dashed lines indicate current flows from the\nionospheric footprint to the magnetopause \u2018\u2018hole\u2019\u2019 and back.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n18 of 25\nA07S22\ned convection flow is not sufficiently constrained by data to\ngive reasonable results for comparison. The same is true for\nthe 0955 UT, 1000 UT (northward IMF conditions), and\n1005 UT maps.\n[83] We shall therefore concentrate on the 1045 UT\nconvection map where enough LOS data are available to\nconstrain the convection patterns and to give a substantial\nbase for comparison. Here LOS Doppler velocities pre-\nsented as gray scale-coded dots and vectors are available\nover the complete FOV of the Finland radar in a band from\n75\u0001\u201380\u0001NMLAT. In theMLT range from 1100 to 1300MLT\nthe Doppler velocities exceed \u00011000 ms\u00031. It can further be\nseen that with enough LOS data present, the throat region of\nthe convection pattern has shifted to 1200 MLT in compar-\nison to 0900\u20131000 MLT in the other convection maps\nunder similar IMF conditions. Comparing these high veloc-\nity LOS data with the Cooling\u2013BATS-R-US traces it has to\nbe noted that they compare well with a minor offset of\napproximately 10\u0001. This slight offset could be the result\nfrom either the MHD simulation in respect to the grid\nresolution, the Cooling model in respect to the simple\nmodels underlying it, or the temporal averaging factor\n(5 min) for the convection maps. Also another factor, which\ncould lead to the offset, could be the difference between the\nCooling magnetopause and the BATS-R-US magnetopause\nboundary. A slight difference between the locations of the\ntwo (cf. Figure 9) would have a stretching\/compressing\neffect on the mapping process. Keeping these factors in\nmind a slight offset of 10\u0001 is acceptable and in terms of\nmodeling (use of two independent models) a good match.\n[84] The model results are therefore consistent with the\nstudy undertaken by Wild et al. [2001, 2003] and extend\nthe former study such that the footprints obtained from the\nCooling model and the MHD simulation can explain the\nionospheric bursts seen in the radars (see Figure 4, sixth\npanel) to a good degree and corroborate the one-to-one\ncorrelation of the ground- and space-based observations.\n[85] Using the technique described above we can now\naccomplish a general three-dimensional view of the field\ntopology of the FTEs and explain the concurrent observa-\ntions of the space- and ground-based instruments. We shall\nfinally consider the FTE observation at 1046 UT which had\nthe largest bipolar signature in the BN component to model\nthe complete set of FTE features discussed above.\n[86] The field-aligned currents give an indicator of the\nprobable location and spatial extent of the reconnection site\nresponsible for the FTE observations. Figure 11 (model\nresults) presents the field-aligned currents in the GSM x\u2013y-\nplane and in the GSM y\u2013z-plane as well as the total\nmagnetic field strength. The Cluster 1 location is marked\nwith the white\/black dot. We note that the reconnection site\nhas a similar extent as discussed above for the FTEs\nobserved inside the magnetopause (cf. Figure 7). The patchy\nenhancements of the field-aligned currents are located in a\nnarrow band of \u00011 RE in the GSM x\u2013y-plane and extend\nover several hours MLT in the postnoon sector at the\nmagnetopause. The GSM y\u2013z-plane representation shows\nthat the y\u2013z extent of the FTE can be identified with \u00014 RE\nin the y direction and \u00012 RE in the z direction. It can also be\nseen that Cluster is at the outer edge of the FTE structure.\n[87] Figure 11 also shows the total magnetic field strength\nin the GSM y\u2013z-plane. Here two clearly defined patches of\nFigure 11. (top and middle) The field-aligned current\ndensity sheets at the z and x position of Cluster 1,\nrespectively, in a GSM reference frame at 1046 UT on the\n14 February 2001, obtained from a BATS-R-US run.\nOverlaid on Figures 11 (top) and 11 (bottom) is the\nmagnetopause boundary after Shue et al.

Overlaid is the MHD-derived magnetic\nfield line topology (black lines) obtained from the Cooling\nmodel traces. Overlaid on all three plots is the Cluster 1\nposition indicated by the white\/black dot.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n19 of 25\nA07S22\nlow magnetic field strength (cf. high plasma beta: Figure 8,\nleft) in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere can be\nobserved, these patches are closely related to the reduced\nshielding effect due to the magnetospheric \u2018\u2018holes\u2019\u2019 as\ndescribed by Crooker and Siscoe [1990]. These patches\nare located directly in the gap between the open and closed\nfield line topology (cf. Figure 9) and indicate the Northern\nand Southern Hemisphere reconnection site counterparts as\noutlined by Crooker [1979] and Luhmann et al. [1984] for\nantiparallel merging. Overlaid on the total magnetic field\nstrength slice are the MHD-derived field lines mapped from\nthe Cooling traces. The shown field line configuration\nresults from a mapping of the Cooling traces which intersect\nthe presented y\u2013z-slice plane for the Cluster location and\nfulfill the conditions; x = 4.15 \u00b1 2 RE, and coincide with the\ntwo low magnetic field strength regions.\n[88] With these information we are able to model the full\nthree-dimensional view of the field line topology. Figure 12\nshows the three-dimensional magnetic field line configura-\ntion just after reconnection took place (for the 1046 UT\nevent). Using the Cooling model traces of the points at\nwhich the flux tubes thread the magnetopause and the MHD\nsimulation, we are able to trace the field lines connected to\nthe Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. We\nhave marked exemplarily those in close proximity to Cluster\nand fulfilling the condition mentioned above in red as well\nas the counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere. In order to\nidentify the Southern Hemisphere field lines, we have used\npoints from the Cooling model traces in the Southern\nHemisphere which coincide with the low magnetic field\nstrength areas in Figure 11 (third frame) and have then chosen\nthree field lines as examples.\n[89] The light gray lines represent the magnetic field lines\nmapped from a 15\u0001 \u0002 15\u0001 latitude-longitude grid of the\nEarth at 100 km altitude. The gray scale slices represent the\nlogarithmic kinetic pressure distribution. The white\/black\ndashed lines indicate the inner magnetopause boundary after\nShue et al. [1997] and the green isosurfaces represent the\nplasma cavities above and beneath the neutral sheet as\nbearing. The modeled field line topology is consistent with\nthe shape and location postulated by Lockwood and\nHapgood [1998] for the Russell and Elphic type FTE\nmodel, and consistent with the open field line topology\nenvisaged by Dungey [1961]. Figure 12 shows for the\nfirst time the global field line topology for concurrent\nspace- and ground-based observations. The presented\ntopology and especially the red marked field lines show\nthe same features as schematically sketched by Lockwood\nand Hapgood [1998]. From the location of the field lines\nand the superimposed forces acting on them from the\nsolar wind, a poleward and dawnward motion for the\nfield lines (red) connected to the Northern Hemisphere\nand duskward and poleward for the ones connected to the\nSouthern Hemisphere can be inferred. These motions\nwould then be consistent with the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere ionospheres radar observations.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[90] In this paper we have extended the work of Daum\nand Wild [2006] in order to analyze the three-dimensional\nlarge-scale structure and evolution of FTEs utilizing a\nglobal MHD simulation combined with in situ space- and\nground-based observations. We have revisited the Cluster\nobservations from the 14 February 2001 in the time from\n0900 to 1100 UT which were first described by Wild et al.\n[2001]. In the period of interest the Cluster formation was\non an outbound pass through the high-latitude postnoon\nmagnetopause during which the magnetic footprint of the\nspacecraft passed through the field of view of the Finland\nSuperDARN radar. Space- and ground-based observations\nhave been combined with a global MHD simulation in order\nto ascertain the large-scale dynamics of the FTEs and the\nassociated reconnection sites.\n[91] During the outbound pass the Cluster field and\nparticle instruments showed magnetic disturbances and a\nmixture of magnetospheric and magnetosheath-like plasma.\nThese perturbations culminated in the observation of four\nmagnetospheric FTEs adjacent to the magnetopause and\nlater the observation of two FTEs during the traversal of the\nmagnetosheath. As indicated by Wild et al. [2001, 2003]\nand Daum and Wild [2006], these field and plasma obser-\nvations are consistent with open flux tubes connected to the\nNorthern Hemisphere which are produced by pulsed recon-\nnection at the dayside magnetopause.\n[92] Examination of the radar data at the location of the\nmagnetically mapped Cluster footprint reveals a band of\nenhanced backscatter between \u000174.5\u0001 to 76.0\u0001N MLAT in\nclose vicinity to the open-closed field line boundary, the\nflows observed in this band by the SuperDARN radar\nstations were mainly westward and poleward. Furthermore\nthe flows observed in the band were found to pulse with\nsimilar periodicity to the observed FTE signatures in the\nspace-based instruments. The radar observations form classic\n\u2018\u2018pulsed ionospheric flows\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018poleward moving radar\nauroral forms\u2019\u2019 which are believed to be directly linked to the\nmotion of newly opened flux tubes over the polar cap.\n[93] Because of the transient nature of the FTE structures,\nwhich extend several Earth radii at the magnetopause and\nseveral hundred kilometers in the conjugate ionosphere,\nonly a global approach can address the linked sets of\nobjectives concerning the nature of this time-varying phe-\nnomenon. The main focus of this paper was to accomplish a\ndirect point-to-point link between the in situ space- and\nground-based observations by tracing the FTE signatures\nfrom the points of observation in the vicinity of the\nmagnetopause down to the conjugate ionosphere. To ac-\ncomplish this, we used the BATS-R-US global MHD code\nin combination with a simple flux tube motion model\n(Cooling) to investigate the large-scale properties (evolu-\ntion, location, orientation, and spatial extend) of the recon-\nnection sites involved in the formation of the FTEs and\nsubsequently the FTE features observed. The Cooling\nmodel was used to track the motion of the FTEs over the\nmagnetopause. The locus of points where the FTE threads\nthe magnetopause was then used to produce three-dimen-\nsional views of the general field line topologies exploiting\nthe high-resolution MHD data. From these topologies and\nthe field-aligned current densities obtained from the MHD\nmodel, the location of the reconnection sites has been\ninferred. The reconnection locations suggested by the\nMHD model were in good agreement with previous theo-\nretical studies undertaken by Penz et al. [2006a] and Penz\n[2006] for the same period of interest.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n20 of 25\nA07S22\n[94] Using the FTE traces given by the Cooling model in\ncombination with the MHD simulation, we were then able\nto trace the motion of the newly opened flux tubes from the\nmagnetopause down to the conjugate ionosphere at an\naltitude of 100 km. Here, the modeled traces show good\ncorrelation with the LOS data of the SuperDARN radar\nsystem with a clear indicated motion westward and pole-\nward as originally outlined by Wild et al. [2003].\n[95] The MHD model suggests an antiparallel merging\nscheme topology as predicted by the characterization of\nPark et al. [2006] for mainly southward (Bz < 0) and\ndawnward (By > 0) IMF conditions, as present at the times\nof observation. The reconnection sites seen in the model\nextend about 3.5 h MLT in the postnoon high-latitude\nmagnetopause in a narrow band of \u00011 RE following the\nshape of the magnetopause. We should note here that due to\nthe time resolution of the MHD run (1 min) this antisunward\ntransient could only be observed in very limited form due to\nthe \u2018\u2018snapshot\u2019\u2019 nature of the MHD modeling technique.\n[96] It should be noted that the reconnection site locations\nin the MHD models and discussed here are directly depen-\ndent upon the resistivity used in the model [Berchem et al.,\n2008]. Too low resistivity could lead to neglecting the\ncomponent merging. However the study of Park et al.\n[2006] shows that the antiparallel merging would be pre-\ndominant under the present IMF conditions so that we are\nconfident in neglecting the component merging here. It also\nshows that even with a global model and in situ observation it\nis still difficult to decide which merging scheme is respon-\nsible for the observations. We have shown that the features\nwhich arose from the antiparallel merging topology present in\nthe model data show a good correlation with the in situ\nobservations. A conclusive answer to whether antiparallel or\ncomponent merging is responsible for the observed features\ncan therefore still not be given and will be scrutinized in\nfurther studies using simultaneous observations of the North-\nern and Southern Hemisphere (e.g., during intervals with\ngreater availability of ionospheric flow measurements).\nFigure 12. Three-dimensional representation of the magnetic field line topology derived from the\nBATS-R-US MHD model run for the 14 February 2001 at 1046 UT. The solid light gray lines indicate\nthe magnetic field line configuration mapped from a 15\u0001\u0002 15\u0001 geographical latitude-longitude grid on the\nEarth at 100 km altitude. The red lines indicate the open magnetic field line mappings obtained from the\nCluster position for theNorthernHemisphere and theCoolingmodel for the SouthernHemisphere. The gray\nscale-coded slices indicate the kinetic pressure distribution obtained from the BATS-R-US model. The\ngreen isosurfaces represent the plasma cavities above and beneath the neutral sheet. The magnetopause\nboundary after Shue et al. [1997] is indicated by the white\/black dashed lines.\nA07S22 DAUM ET AL.: A 3-D GLOBAL MHD SIMULATION OF FTES\n21 of 25\nA07S22\n[97] We have demonstrated that the synergy of localized\nobservations and global modeling presents a powerful and\nunique technique to investigate the large-scale dynamics of\nthe coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere\nexploiting space- and ground-based instruments as well as\nglobal MHD simulation. This allows us to put the localized\nobservations in a global context and follows the objectives\nfirst outlined by Berchem [2000] which are the verification\nand validation of the models and the identification of the\ndynamics of large-scale processes in the geospace environ-\nment. Owing to the synergy effects of this combination, we\nwere able to unite into one study several individual study\nresults which addressed distinct observational and charac-\nteristic model features of FTEs. This allowed us for the first\ntime to produce a coherent three-dimensional picture of the\nformation, evolution, and topology of FTEs in combination\nwith concurrent observations of FTEs and ionospheric flow\npatterns.\n[98] While state-of-the-art MHD models can be used to\nestablish causal relationships between the point measure-\nments taken by the instruments and the large-scale dynam-\nics present in the magnetosphere, in order to characterize the\nsmall-scale processes identified by the instruments global\nkinetic simulations are indispensable and will be subject of\nfuture studies in the modeling community due to the recent\nadvances in technology and simulations. Although global\nkinetic models are still a few years from being widely used\nin the community, first multiscale modeling approaches\nhave developed in order to fill the gap between the small-\nscale kinetic models and the global simulations. A first\napproach is described by Kuznetsova et al. [2007] and\nbridges the gap successfully between the two modeling\ndomains, further studies of this kind will follow until the\nadvances in technology will allow the global kinetic models\nto substitute the currently dominant global MHD simula-\ntions. A first approach to these \u2018\u2018global\u2019\u2019 kinetic models is\ndescribed by, e.g., Gargate\u00b4 et al. [2007, 2008]. Here\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) hybrid simulations are used to study\nspace plasma interactions using kinetic ions and fluid\nelectrons. Also here first intermediate steps have developed\nto combine the MHD and the PIC simulation [e.g.,\nSugiyama and Kusano, 2006; Sugiyama et al., 2007].\nFurther extensions of these combinational studies of MHD\nand PIC will then also allow detailed small-scale analyses of\nphenomena in the geospace environment.\n[99] Acknowledgments.
