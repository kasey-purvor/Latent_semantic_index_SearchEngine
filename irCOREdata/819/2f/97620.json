Trapped in the Earth\u2019s mag\u2013netic field and encircling \nthe Earth like a ring doughnut, the number of electrons travelling at relativistic velocities \nwithin these belts can vary by up to five orders of magnitude within just a few days, or \neven minutes. Such extreme fluctuations are known to be caused by a combination of \nmechanisms taking place within the geomagnetic field, but the exact mechanism by \nwhich electrons are accelerated from energies of the order of a few keV to several MeV \nhas long been a puzzle. In recent years, two leading theories have emerged to explain \nthis. The first involves a process of radial diffusion: electrons diffuse towards the Earth as \na result of large-scale electric and magnetic field fluctuations in the outer belt, and are \naccelerated by betatron and Fermi processes1,2. And the second involves local wave-\nparticle interactions, in which electrons are accelerated by gyro-resonance with waves \nthat propagate through the heart of the radiation belts3,4. Evidence supporting both \nmechanisms was provided during a rare and unusual magnetospheric event that has come \nto be known as the 2003 Hallowe\u2019en geomagnetic storm5,6. On page 614 of this issue, \nChen and colleagues7 now break this theoretical deadlock, to report definitive \nobservational evidence that supports gyro-resonant wave interactions as the dominant \nprocess of relativistic electron acceleration.  \n \nAccording to the radial diffusion model, electrons are transported to within 2.5 Earth \nradii (Re) during magnetic storms from a reservoir of particles beyond geostationary orbit \nat 6.6 Re. As with any diffusion theory, there must be a gradient in the distribution of \nparticles, and some mechanism by which the particles are scattered. But in the \nmagnetosphere collisions between particles are rare, and scattering across the magnetic \nfield is most effective when there \nare electromagnetic waves at frequencies of a few millihertz that match the frequency at \nwhich electrons drift around the Earth. Moreover, for diffusion to be directed inwards \ntowards the Earth, the gradient in electron phase-space density (which is proportional to \nthe measured flux divided by the square of the electron momentum) must increase \noutwards. Using two years of data collected by multiple satellites at several different \nlocations in the  magnetosphere, Chen et al. find that peaks in the electron phase-space \ndensity are most commonly observed near 5.5 Re, near the centre of the outer belt. These \npeaks are inconsistent with inward radial diffusion from a source \nbeyond geostationary orbit. Instead, they strongly suggest that there is local acceleration \nnear 5.5 Re, and that radial diffusion actually transports electrons away from the Earth, \nbeyond the radiation belts.  \n \nIn contrast to radial diffusion, which necessarily acts over large distances of the order of \n1 Re, gyro-resonant wave acceleration is the most effective form of localized acceleration \nwithin the magnetosphere. By this mechanism, the sporadic injection of particles \noriginating from the solar wind and, through other complicated multistage acceleration \nprocesses, the ionosphere, cause an anisotropic distribution of particles and excite a \nvariety of different types of electromagnetic waves. Of these, so-called \u2018whistler mode \nchorus waves\u2019 undergo some of the strongest interactions with relativistic electrons. The \nrelative motion of such waves and injected particles along magnetic field lines induces a \nDoppler shift of the wave frequency, causing it to converge to the same frequency at \nwhich the electrons gyrate in the magnetic field \u2014 an effect known as gyro-resonance. \nThis in turn causes the electrons to diffuse in a direction that counteracts any local \nanisotropy. In most cases, and for a broad band of whistler-mode frequencies, this usually \ninduces the electrons to diffuse into small-pitch-angle trajectories (in a direction almost \nparallel to the magnetic field), to lose energy (which in turn amplifies the waves), and to \neventually precipitate into the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. But for some of the electrons \ninjected into the magnetosphere at larger pitch angles, such resonant effects can have the \nopposite effect, causing them to gain ever more energy, until they reach relativistic \nspeeds and become trapped in the geomagnetic field. Gyro-resonant wave acceleration is \nfavoured in regions of low particle density where the phase velocity of the waves \nbecomes large. The peaks in phase-space density that Chen et al. observe are near 5.5 Re, \nand generally lie outside the region of high-density cold plasma, as required for efficient \nacceleration.  \n \nThe latest observations7 indicate that we should adopt a new paradigm for producing the \nouter radiation belt, as suggested in Fig. 1. Wave acceleration requires a seed population \nof keV electrons to excite the waves, but there is plentiful evidence that this can be \nsupplied from the outer regions by induced electric fields as a result of the substorm cycle \n\u2014 a cycle of energy storage in the magnetic field followed by explosive conversion into \nparticle energy by magnetic reconnection. Radial diffusion may also help to supply the \nlower-energy seed population. As low-energy electrons penetrate closer to the Earth they \ndevelop an anisotropic distribution which becomes unstable, excites electromagnetic \nwaves, and accelerates electrons via gyro-resonant interactions. This process should form \na peak in the accelerated electron distribution followed by radial diffusion to fill up the \nentire outer radiation belt. Moreover, as all the outer magnetized planets have electron \nradiation belts and all have been observed to support whistler mode waves, acceleration \nby gyro-resonant wave\u2013particle interactions may be more common throughout the Solar \nsystem than was first suspected.  \n \nAlthough the present results may provide a resolution to the debate over which \nmechanism is the dominant cause of relativistic electron acceleration, there are still many \nquestions to answer. The radiation belts are intensified in only 53% of geomagnetic \nstorms and most likely to occur during periods of fast solar wind speeds exceeding 500 \nkm s\u20131 \u2014 why this could be is unclear. The role of whistler waves is certainly likely to \nbe important, but the exact role in electron acceleration and loss by many other types of \nwaves, and how the solar wind provides the source of free energy to drive the waves, \nremains to be explored. And beyond such fundamental issues lies the wider implications \nthat these processes could have, such as for precipitation on atmospheric chemistry and \nozone depletion. New satellite missions are needed to understand these issues.  \n \nInterest in the radiation belts is far from just academic. Relativistic electrons \u2014 known as \n\u2018killer electrons\u2019 \u2014 cause radiation damage to satellites, resulting in malfunctions and \nshortening their operational lives. During \nthe 2003 Hallowe\u2019en storm, which caused the radiation belts to drain and reform closer to \nthe Earth, more than 30 satellites reported malfunctions, and one was a total loss. A \nmodern telecommunications satellite costs about US$250 million to build, $100 million \nto launch into geostationary orbit, and annual insurance premiums are typically between \n3 and 5% of the sum insured. With more than 300 satellites in geosynchronous orbit, and \na growing reliance on satellite technology, this represents a huge investment in need of \nprotection. Understanding radiation belt dynamics should help us to better manage this \nrisk. \n \nReferences \n1. Schulz, M. & Lanzerotti L.
