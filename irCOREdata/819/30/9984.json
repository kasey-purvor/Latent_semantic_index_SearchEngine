Notable here\nis the trend set by the journal Home Cultures; exemplary in this vein is the recent book\nHome (2006) by Alison Blunt and Robyn Dowling, who also contribute to the themed\nessays that follow in this issue. Among other things, scholarship such as this shows\nhow home is a complex field of feelings and subjectivity: an anchor for senses of\nbelonging, a mechanism for living with, and in, the experience of transnationalism,\nand a site for constituting and performing selfhood.\nLike other social and cultural geographies, this interest with the meaning of home\nis not untouched by a material turn. There has been, for example, a new appreciation\nof the coconstitutive relationship between the formal features of actual dwellings and\nthe social life that inhabits them. In good part inaugurating such scholarship, anthro-\npologist Danny Miller (1988) wrote of the way residents worked to appropriate the\ndesign features of council estates in an attempt ``to transform alienable goods into\ninalienable culture' (page 353). More recently, geographer Mark Llewellyn (2004) has\nshown how the residents of Kensal House enhanced its liveability by renegotiating the\ndictates of modernist living embodied in its architecture. In a similar material vein is a\ngrowing interest in the deployment of objects in the home as a means of expressing and\nconstituting the self. This approach challenges essentialised understanding of home\nand identity by illustrating how objects extend the reach of home through time and\nacross space. Divia Tolia-Kelly (2004), for example, shows how British Asians use\nthe physicality of `home possessions' (ornaments, souvenirs, and sacred objects)\nto draw the memory of homes left behind into their experience of dwellings lived\nin today. Greg Noble (2004) shows, too, how the accumulation of objects into home\nis simultaneously an accumulation of being and a quest for recognition.\nThere are then already established traditions working with the materialisation of\nhome, and we hope that the themed papers in this issue elaborate and extend that\nscholarship in new ways. As a means of framing these essays, which can really speak\nfor themselves, we use this editorial to offer some suggestive thoughts on the direction\nand meaning of the intellectual work of rematerialising home. To do this we revisit an\nold materialism, engage with a new one, and conclude with an idea about what to do\nnext.\nLooking back...\nPutting the words `history' and `materiality' together serves as a reminder that materi-\nalism is always (whatever else it conveys) about money; and of course about the power\nrelations and emotional energies that vie for it. So our first point is that the project of\nrematerialising home has an inescapably financial bottom line. As Georg Simmel\nrecognised, money itself is formless; it flows\u00f6as Gordon Clark (2005) so aptly puts\nit\u00f6like mercury. But it also settles out into `things', like bricks and mortar, that give it\npresence; that quite literally lend it form and value.\nThe only real attempt to grapple with this in relation to housing and home is\nlocated in the all-but-forgotton notion of `housing classes' developed by John Rex\nGuest editorial\nEnvironment and Planning A 2008, volume 40, pages 515^519\ndoi:10.1068\/a40357and Robert Moore (1967). Whatever it subsequently became, this idea was at heart an\nattempt to show that the materiality of housing could intervene in the structured\ninequalities associated with labour migration\u00f6in this instance (Britain in the early\n1960s)\u00f6to create an `underclass' excluded not only from direct financial rewards but\nalso from the in-kind benefits of the welfare state. Unfortunately, this attempt to\nposition dwelling as a materialisation of political economy was hijacked by the turn\nto consumption that has dominated housing studies ever since. This of course has been\na highly productive vein: we know more now than ever before about housing consump-\ntion as an exercise in `taste' and `distinction', as a means of engaging with cultures\nof consumption, of charting the mutual constitution of artefacts and subjectivity, of\nthe relationship between lifestyles and desires, of engaging with the sentiments and the\nsymbolism that drive the search for homes, of the acquisition of particular property\nstyles, of the shape of domestic interiors, and so on. But any financial logic driving this\nremains firmly locked in a bulky black box which, until recently, has kept all things\neconomic well away from the world of social and cultural affairs.\nOne inspiration for this set of papers is the possibility to open up the black boxes\nof economy to scrutiny, just at a time when a new financial order is linking `home\neconomics' to global flows of credit and cash to an unprecedented extent. The fixtures\nof old housing `classes' prove increasingly fluid as the art of global economy escapes\nthe trappings of production and labour, and is anchored instead in the circulation of\nmoney. Indeed, as everyday budgets (should we buy that lamp for the living room, why\nnot add a fireplace to increase the value of property) get drawn into global flows of cash\nand credit it is worth tracing the flow of money into and out of the fabric of housing,\nnot least to know how new materialisations of money can\u00f6as wealth accumulates into\nand through property\u00f6begin to eclipse the division of labour.\nCharting the flow of the materials of economy (money, markets, calculative prac-\ntices, valuing, and value-adding) as they travel into and out of the materials of housing\nand home making is a project taken up both in the papers that follow and elsewhere\n(Munro and Smith, 2008; Smith and Searle, 2008). Such scholarship celebrates and\nextends that convergence of cultural economy with material sociology which has so far\nbeen concerned mainly with sectors and sites outside the home.\n...Moving on\nOur turn back to historical materialism simultaneously foregrounds a set of ideas\nanimated by more recent engagement with materiality through studies in science and\ntechnology. The ``new materialisms'', as Steve Woolgar (2002, page 261) calls them,\noperationalise ``perspectives which exhibit an increased sensitivity to the performative\nand integrative capacity of things to help make what we call society.'' Such approaches\nrecognise that people's relationships with `things' are as important for sociological\ninquiry as are their links to other people. They also variously challenge the duality\nbetween the material and the social. Applied to the context of rematerialising the\nhome, such approaches expose a whole range of human and nonhuman relations that\nbring the structures and meanings of properties into being; which sustain and maintain\nthese assemblages and reshape them in various ways. Through the lens of `new materi-\nalism' the world of home swarms with the many sociotechnical associations that\ncoproduce home life. Home is not simply the cultivation of a sense of belonging, nor\nmerely a site of consumption, it is quite literally a fabric-ation.\nAlthough science and technology studies (STS) routinely interrogate a range of\ntechnologies, the technology of the house, like architectural technologies generally,\nhas received only limited attention. This is despite the fact that in its more theoretical\nmusing STS has often taken up the metaphorics of architecture and building. There is,\n516 Guest editorialhowever, now an emergent scholarship that is taking the methodological and theoretical\ninsights of science and technology studies and applying them to housing and home\nbuilding. For example, a forthcoming issue of Science Studies coedited by Simon Guy\nand Albena Yaneva will feature a suite of articles considering the relevance of STS\napproaches to urban developments of various kinds, including housing. Such scholar-\nship takes in new directions the research trajectories marked out by Elizabeth Shove's\n(Shove, 2003; Shove et al, 2007) exemplary work on the sociology of everyday home\ntechnologies. Her interest has been in the practical sociotechnical choreographies that\ncoproduce, through often quite ordinary and everyday competencies, the experience of\ndwelling. For example, her recent collaborative work on kitchens provides important\nmethodological templates for charting all kinds of geographies, domestic and other.\nThe kitchen is not conceived of as a place but as an ``orchestrating concept'' in which\nmaterials, images, and forms of competence ``hang together'' at different points in time\nand space (Hand and Shove, 2004, page 235). There are new imperatives for scholars to\nattend to the logics of this sociotechnical coproduction of domesticity. As the work of\nHeather Lovell (2004; 2005) has shown, policy frameworks generated by worries about\nclimate change have implicated house design and home-life routines in novel ways.\nGoverning the sociotechnical systems of the home in the name of sustainability not\nonly produces new types of low-energy housing, but also seeks to constitute new kinds\nof domestic citizens (with compliant daily routines of energy consumption and waste\nmanagement) dependent upon radically restructured frameworks of value.\nThe lens of STS reminds us that the house, no matter what typology, comprises a\nset of contingently held material and social orders (Jacobs, 2006; Jacobs et al, 2006).\nThe acts of `housing' and `dwelling' are a coproduction between those who are housed\nand the variant technologies that do the work of housing: ornaments and decorations,\nyes, architecture and bricks and mortar, sanitation and communication technologies,\ntoo, but also housing policies and practices, mortgage lending and insurance, credit\nscores, and all the other lively `things' of finance. The papers to follow offer varied\nways to conceptualise and chart these housing orders. For example, Susan Smith (2008)\ninvestigates the new generation of financial services that render housing wealth inter-\nchangeable with the cash economy, interacting with politics and policy to turn owned\nhomes into a hybrid of money and materials. Dowling (2008) conceives of dwelling as\naffective labour, honing in on the constant work required to reconcile taste-driven\nmodels of dwelling with the messier practicalities of children and clutter. Blunt\n(2008) materially reanimates the concept of housing biography, centre stage of which\nis not an ungrounded residents' history of housing but a situated house entwined with\nhuman and nonhuman life stories. And Jane Jacobs and Stephen Cairns (2008) extend\nthe notion of an ethopolitics of housing by investigating how the state and interior\ndesign coproduce not only the modern home, but also the modern subject.\nRematerialising home\nThis theme issue seeks to stimulate conversation around the site of the home in order\nto enliven current understandings of materiality and invigorate some areas of housing\nstudies. Our starting point is an uneasiness about the volume and enlargement of the\nexplanatory claims of the concept of `home' vis-a \u00a9 -vis other categories pertinent to\nthe experience of dwelling, notably the idea of the house and housing. Home has grown\never expansive as a term, not only encapsulating the site of dwelling as a place for\nsleeping, eating, nurturing, and engaging in domestic labour, but also as the anchor\nfor more widely scaled notions of national and transnational belonging, and of other\nideas too rich and varied to enumerate. But for all that, there is something missing,\nand that is precisely the articulation of housing with home. Housing and home are\nGuest editorial 517both nouns, but the Oxford English Dictionary gives us also the verb: ``the action of\nhouse'', and it is to this actancy that we turn as we outline some merits of bringing\nthese awkwardly fragmented concepts back together.\nWe look among other things to efforts to create a `material sociology' of economy,\nand in particular to Michel Callon's recent work on the constitution of value in and\nthrough markets. This provides a suggestive framework for breaking down a founda-\ntional part of the infrastructure that divides thinking about home and housing. One of\nthe key contributions of recent scholarship on the rematerialisation of the home has\nbeen to chart the emotional-cum-material work that home making entails (decorating,\ntidying, cleaning, improving, designing). Bringing this work into view has fundamen-\ntally challenged drier analyses of housing and housing markets. But it has also given\nflesh to a binary, imputed in more philosophical accounts of home such as those\nof Martin Heidegger (1975 [1951]) and Gaston Bachelard (1969), in which the concept of\nhome is understood primarily as an affective concept (an emotional sensibility, a\nmeaning) while house as defined as a material concept (a thing, a commodity). It is\nour view that this binary thinking has now reached the end of its usefulness. Looking to\nresolve this, Callon and Muniesa's (2005) account of markets as collective calculating\ndevices reminds us that they are an agencement (an active assemblage) in which there is\nno single mechanism, but a dispersed and relationally arranged set of valuation pro-\ncesses. Similarly, if we did away with the home\/housing binary and attended instead to\nan assemblage of dwelling then we would capture the dispersed and variant logics of\nvalue and valuation that actively constitute not only the field of meaning, experience\nand practice that is called `home' but also the house that is the locus of its performance.\nIn short, this collection engages with the uneven distributions of calculative energies\nthrough which value is apportioned and home\/housing fabric-ated. This more variable\nmodel of valuation registers the many ways in which the emotional terrain brought into\nview by cultural studies of the home (meaning, memory, identity) is inextricably\nentangled with the material, economic territory that often pre-occupies housing studies\n(markets, regulations, policy). In this revised rematerialisation of home, it would\nbe possible to regard the experience of dwelling as an outcome of the differential\ndirections and volumes of valuing: what gets invested in and what does not; what is\noverinvested in and what becomes invisible or beyond care; what is maintained and\nimproved and what is let go. We see this not simply as a financial question, nor even\njust a question of value as a form of treasuring; it is also about utility, functionality,\npossession, maintenance, how something stays together or comes to fall apart.\nWe set off our thinking in this short editorial by noting the important advance in\nrecent scholarship in detailing how and why home encapsulates so much more than\nhousing. So sure footed has this adjustment been that we are now at a point where to\ntalk only of housing is insufficient to understand the complexity of what home is, both\nemotionally and materially. But our sense is that if we really push the notion of\nrematerialising home, if we open up the idea of home to a conception of materiality\nthat looks back as it looks forward, then we are forced to admit that in much of the\ncurrent scholarship on home the valuing logics of housing, including housing markets,\nis unhelpfully `black boxed'. To rematerialise home radically is to be drawn back to the\ninsistent but uneasy articulation between processes traditionally conceived of as per-\ntaining to housing and processes more recently set up as belonging to home. For most\npeople, most of the time, whether directly or indirectly, housing\u00f6the materials of\naccommodation, the business of dwelling\u00f6insistently occupies the site of home.\nOne claim that recent scholarship on home can rightly make is that it has enlivened\nand given meaning to the drier concept of house as property: in this respect home\nreally is far more than `house'. But our plea, as we move further along the path of\n518 Guest editorialrematerialising home, is that work on home cultures and housing studies each exceed\ntheir own briefs, and find new points of reconnection. How do house biographies and\nhousing careers link up, for example; how do the ethopolitics of housing\u00f6a politics\nof conduct embodied in the production, distribution, regulation, and occupation of\nproperty\u00f6speak to geographies of home life; and so on. Addressing these points\nof intersection could, we suggest, make for styles of scholarship which better grasp\nnot only the art of home and the practice of housing, but also the ethical parameters of\nwhat Heidegger referred to as a `proper dwelling'.\nJane M Jacobs, School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh\nSusan J Smith, Department of Geography, University of Durham\nReferences\nBachelard G, 1969 The Poetics of Space translated by M Jolas (Beacon Press, Boston, MA)\nBlunt A, 2008,``The `Skyscraper settlement': home and residence at Christodoran House''\nEnvironment and Planning A 40 550 ^ 571\nBlunt A, Dowling R, 2006, Home (Routledge, London)\nClark G, 2005,``Money flows like mercury: the geography of global finance'' Geografiska Annaler,\nSeries B: Human Geography 87 99^112\nCallon M, Muniesa F, 2005,``Economic markets as calculative collective devices'' Organization\nStudies 261229^1250\nDowling R, 2008,``Accommodating open plan: children, clutter, and containment in suburban\nhouses in Sydney, Australia'' Environment and Planning A 40 536 ^ 549\nHand M, Shove E, 2004,``Orchestrating concepts: kitchen dynamics and regime change in Good\nHousekeeping and Ideal Home, 1922^2002'' Journal of Home Cultures 1 235^256\nHeidegger M, 1975 [1951],``Building dwelling thinking'', in Poetry, Language,Thought translated\nby A Hofstader (Harper and Row, New York) pp 145^161\nJacobs J M, 2006,``A geography of big things'' Cultural Geographies 13 1^2 7\nJacobs J M, Cairns S, 2008,``The modern touch: interior design and modernisation in post-\nindependence Singapore'' Environment and Planning A 40 5 7 2^59 5\nJacobs J M, Cairns S, Strebel I, 2006,```A tall story...but, a fact just the same': the Red Road\nhighrise as a black box Urban Studies 44 609^629\nLlewellyn M, 2004,```Urban village'or `white house': envisioned spaces, experienced places, and\neveryday life at Kensal House, London in the 1930s'', Environment and Planning D: Society\nand Space 22 229 ^ 249\nLovell H, 2004,``Framing sustainable housing as a solution to climate change'' Journal of\nEnvironmental Policy and Planning 6 35 ^ 55\nLovell H, 2005,``Supply and demand for low energy housing in the UK: insights from a science\nand technology studies approach'' Housing Studies 20 815 ^ 829\nMiller D, 1988,``Appropriating the state on the council estate'', Man, New Series 23 353 ^ 372\nMunro M, Smith S J, 2008,``Calculated affection: charting the complex economy of home\npurchase'' Housing Studies,i np r e s s\nNoble G, 2004,``Accumulating being'' International Journal of Cultural Studies 7 23 3^256\nRex J, Moore R,1967 Race, Community and Conflict: A Study of Sparkbrock (Oxford University\nPress, Oxford)\nShove E, 2003 Comfort, Cleanliness and Convenience: the Social Organization of Normality\n(Berg, Oxford)\nShove E,Watson M, Hand M, Ingram J, 2007 The Design of Everyday Life (Berg, Oxford)\nSmith S J, 2008,``Owner-occupation: at home with a hybrid of money and materials'' Environment\nand Planning A 40 520 ^ 535\nSmith S J, Searle B A, 2008,``Dematerialising money: observations on the flow of wealth from\nhousing to other things'', Housing Studies in press\nTolia-Kelly D, 2004,```Locating processes of identification: studying the precipitates of re-memory\nthroughartefactsintheBritishAsian home''TransactionsoftheInstituteofBritishGeographers,\nNew Series 29 314 ^ 329\nWoolgar S, 2002,``After word?\u00f6On some dynamics of duality interrogation or: why bonfires\nare not enough'' Theory, Culture and Society 19 26 1^2 70\n\u00df 2008 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain\nGuest editorial 519"}
