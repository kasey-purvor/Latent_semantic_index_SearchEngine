Whilst positive \nsteps have been made since the collapse of Communism in 1989 and entry into \nthe European Union on the part of eight CEE countries in 2004, and another two \nin 2007, research in this area shows a divergence in traditional and local \nconcerns as concerns crime and security. Continuing to be shaped by \nCommunist rule, the manner in which these assert themselves may be at odds \nwith global patterns of thought, providing a critical portrait of post-Communist \nEurope. As observed by Ismail Kadare \u2018[t]he only way you can get a grip on a \nplace overcome by paranoia is by becoming a little paranoid yourself.1 This \nanalysis demonstrates that much work is needed on the part of the European \nUnion and CEE states to ensure that appropriate security strategies are \nimplemented to strengthen democratic values and the rule of law. Ideally this \nprocess entails an appreciation of local values and cultural patterns. \n \n                                                 \n\u2022 Lecturer-in-Law, Lancaster University Law School, United Kingdom.

Introduction \nSecurity is certainly a puzzle \u2013 the state\u2019s guarantee to ensure law and order is \nan important promise to society, and one laden with controversy. Critical \nquestions concerning the transformation of crime control models, the reasons \nunderpinning particular decisions and their ensuing consequences, are not only \nalluring, but paramount. \u2018The worldview has long since been overlaid by a desire \nfor security that relies upon false promises by governments and wilful blindness \nto the facts of crime by individuals\u2026it is a puzzle why the myth of personal safety \nis so powerful and enduring\u2019.2 \nRecent scholarship in this area has explored the concept of security \nthrough various lenses, investigating, inter alia, questions regarding \nterminology;3 security and governance;4 and contemporary crime control.5 \nSeveral scholars, notably Zedner, and Edwards and Hughes, acknowle\nneed for comparative research, so that we may better appreciate how the \nconcept of security operates in different local contexts, indicating peculiar \ndge the \n                                                 \n2 L.

Such an exploration is not only relevant to the \nCEE, but also in the wider context of Europe, as eight post-Communist states \nentered the EU7 in 2004, and two more8 in 1 January 2007. Despite the EU \ntrying to assert a strong lead in shaping respective CEE crime control models, a \ncurrent examination of security in Europe shows that Europe itself has ente\nan uncertain terrain, sending conflicting messages to CEE countries that reflect\nwarm welcome and, at the same time, an evident concern related to its borders. \nThe resulting notion of Europe\u2019s \u2018fortress mentality\u2019 arose from tensions between \nthe internal and external security policies of the EU, an area governed by a \nbranch of the EU that has undergone serious reform.9 As noted by Grabbe, \n \nTheory\u2019, 46 British Journal of Criminology (2006) pp. 641-660; and A.-M.

Some \u2018transitologists\u2019 and other scholars of post-totalitarian and post-\nauthoritarian societies claim that remnants of Communist rule have shaped and \ntransformed themselves in ways that effect the setting up of democratic rule.11 \nNowhere is this clearer that the area of crime control. \n  The first part of this article considers crime control under former \nCommunist rule. Crime control was an important part of a repressive criminal \njustice system and the criminal law was utilised as an instrumental tool.12 \nPunishment was an important component of maintaining law and order and \nrepressive measures were used against specific targets (namely political \nopposition) and symbolically (such as in the case of the crime of vagrancy or \nspeculation).13  The use of harsh and repressive punishment under Communist \nrule reveals that security operated as an illusion on two levels: the promise of law \nand order on the part of the state and the unique picture of crime projected both \nas a fear and non-existent feature of the state.14 As articulated by Kadare, '[T]he \nbrain of a tyrant often worked according to what might be called the \u201carchitecture \n                                                 \n10 H.

Terror was constructed backwards, like dreams, which is to say, \nstarting from the end.\u201915 \nThe analysis serves as a starting point in assessing progress of CEE \nstates following enlargement, considered in the second section. The examination \ndemonstrates that while the CEE traditionally, and rightly, sees itself as part of \nEurope,16 respective domestic policies reveal a divergence that unmasks a \nparticular shift in governance and crime control, which has a paradoxical flavour. \nThe final section addresses how the \u2018punitive\u2019 nature of CEE societies \nmay hold the key to the particular approach and perspective on security. Case \nstudies focus the capital punishment as a component of the \u2018punitive\u2019 state. The \nextent to which present transformations of the CEE state and questioning its \ncurrent place in the area of crime control in Europe has on the \u2018politics of \n(in)security\u201917 raises key questions concerning the nature of democracy in the \nCEE and further, broader consequences for Europe. This examination of the \npost-Communist period once again confirms the complex nature of CEE \nhistories. Indeed, \u2018postcommunism is a multi-faceted, heterogeneous \nphenomenon shot through with paradoxes while at the same time revealing the \nunderlying paradigmatic shifts, not only in theory but also in reality, of our \ntimes.\u201918 \n \n                                                 \n15 I.

Crime Control under Communism (1945-1989) \nAccording to Fati\u0107, a moral and cultural order is comprised of certain values, \nwhich allows us to perceive the law as a normative framework within which a \nnetwork of legitimate mutual expectations between members of society are \nestablished \u2013 this, in turn, breathes life into the notion of 'social capital trust'.19  In \nthe CEE, for nearly forty years the \u2018state was central to the Soviet communism \nand, therefore, any research on what followed that system has to account for the \ntransformation of the old state\u2019s structures and mentality\u2019.20  \n\u0141o\u015b aptly notes that the Soviet state\u2019s domain once entailed public spaces \nthat are now viewed as private spaces or property. This includes the area of \ncriminal justice. The type of crime control model that was established under \nCommunist rule was based on Marxist-Leninist ideology. For a brief but \nsignificant time this ideology was dictated by Stalinist thought (1944-1953).21  \nThis was characterised by a regime that mirrored the \u2018cult of personality\u2019 that \nshaped Soviet Communist rule.22  Even before the Second World War ended, \nthe region\u2019s criminal law policies were created by provisional governments set up\nin the region, which passed decrees that were for the most part ordained by th\nSoviet government in Moscow.\n \ne \n                                                \n23 This meant that criminal laws were geared to \n \n19 A.

Medvedev, Let History Judge: the Origins and Consequences of \nStalinism (New York 1971).  \n23 The provisions of the Polish Military Criminal Code from 28 September 1944 concerning state \nsecurity, which were carried over from the 1932 code, were also applied to civilians after the war. \nThe provisions foresaw 11 crimes which called for the death penalty, which were targeted at \n 6\ntarget the elimination of political opposition as viewed by Soviet officials, which \nincluded a wide range of professions and members of the intelligentsia. Decrees \nthat identified as criminal collaboration with \u2018fascists\u2019 masked the underlying \nmotive on the part of Soviet leaders to dispose of members of the underground, \nespecially those who led successful operations during the war. Secret trials, as \nwell as show trials, defined the repressive nature of the regime. The essence of \nthese trials relied on evidence obtained through interrogation methods that \npresent-day would clearly violate principles set out in Articles 5 (personal liberty) \nand 6 (fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Although the \n\u2018dark period\u2019 nominally ended with Stalin\u2019s death aspects survived that would \ndrive this repressive apparatus until its demise in 1989.24 The role of security \nservices, across CEE, played a paramount role in supporting a regime of tyranny \nand terror throughout Communist rule. The core of this philosophy is aptly \nsummed up by the police network that was created in Yugoslavia, for example, \nthat aimed to \u2018strike terror into the hearts of those who do not like this sort of \nYugoslavia\u2019.25  \nThus, several meanings could be attached to notions of security, crime, \nand risk, as seen from the perspective of the state and citizen. It is useful to think \nof the state institutions traditionally connected with crime control (police, courts, \nprisons, for example) to have, over the decades, \u2018become infused with, and \n                                                                                                                                                 \npotential political opponents. Without changing the Polish criminal code, but introducing new \ntypes of crimes to the text, the draconian manner in which the authorities wished to turn the code \ninto a repressive tool was revealed. See A. Fijalkowski, \u2018The Abolition of the Death Penalty in \nCentral and Eastern Europe\u2019, 9 Tilburg Foreign Law Review (2001) pp. 62-83. \n24 Soviet leaders were keen to keep files on each other; a practice perfected by Stalin, these files \nwould later serve as blackmail or elimination of colleagues. \n25 T. Judt, op. cit., p. 173. \n 7\nshaped by, some specific ways of thinking and acting in relation to crime and its \ncontrol\u2019.26 Indeed, one of the main objectives behind the wave of repression, i.e., \nshow trials, was to \u2018mobilise public opinion\u2019, according to which courts would \n\u2018educate citizens in devotion and loyalty toward the [People\u2019s] Republic\u2019, which \nhad its roots in the teachings of Stalin\u2019s top jurist and architect of the show trial, \nAndrei Vyshinsky.27 But the true meaning is masked: in fact the citizen is not \nasked to believe in the information, but merely to repeat it. In other words, this \nwas \u2018training in repetition\u2019.28 \u2018The media\u2019s role was to school and mobilize the \npopulation\u2019.29 Further, the fact that the trials were clearly based on falsified \ntestimonies might hint that they were meant to seek justice, when in fact they \ndemonstrated the power of the Soviet system in showing the public with whom \nthe blame lie, and with whom the reward for loyalty and subservience rested.30 A \n\u2018multiplicity of strategies, techniques, and rationalities\u201931 characterise the state \nwith no seeming \u2018sovereign actor able to steer or regulate\u2019.32 The Communist \nregime had to maintain that crime would \u2018wither\u2019 away as the society drew closer \ntowards Communism, yet it had to, at the same time, take on a stronger role, \nwhich meant that vigilance had to be maintained for opposition to Marxist-\nLeninist ideals could be identified within society. This paradoxical role would \n                                                 \n26 I. Loader and R. Sparks, loc. cit., p. 84. \n27 See his The Law of the Soviet State, trans. H. W.

A key to \ncommunist societies\u2019 stability was the well-internalised fear of the party-state and \nits seemingly omnipresent security forces\u2019.35 In this constellation, the \u2018multiple \nrelations of power traverse, characterize, and constitute the social body; they are \nindissociable from a discourse of truth\u2026\u201936 Judt notes that Eastern European \npolitics and government became equated with corruption and indiscriminate \nsuppression, \u2018practiced by and for the benefit of a venal clique, itself rent by \nsuspicion and fear\u2019.37 \nFrom the citizens\u2019 perspective, crime took on a paradoxical meaning. \u0141o\u015b \ndescribes how the imprisonment of a parent owing to membership in the \nopposition movement could be seen as heroic among peers and the outside.38 \nWhat was viewed as criminal was the state making certain acts, such as political \nopposition, criminal.

Some scholars term this as \u2018dirty togetherness\u2019,39 a complicity in \nparticipating in illegal acts that undoubtedly reverberates on how the individual \nperceives crime and security. These \u2018perverse forms of loyalty based on a matrix \nof different, more or less connected, partnerships aiming at making use of all \nformal and official structures in order to take them over for private goals\u2019.40 \nBecause of these different vantage points, society had to adopt a means \nof coping. In other words, certain attitudes and mentalities had to be adopted to \nhelp adapt to circumstances that did not allow individuals the scope to voice their \nconcerns about crime. \u0141o\u015b identifies these as \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018taboo\u2019 mentalities.41 \nThe former relates to the Communist regime\u2019s control formula, which centred on \n\u2018specific technologies that sought to restrain agency, contain population \nmovement and communication and produce captive populations through state \nmonopolies over employment, trade unions and social organisations\u2019.42 The \n\u2018taboo mentality\u2019 emerges \u2018[i]n the absence of clear rules, institutional guarantees \nor a rationality-based political culture, [propelling] each individual almost \ninstinctively [to mark] for him or herself the taboo areas to avoid\u2019.43  \nBourke\u2019s work on fear may provide a further explanation. In differentiating \nbetween fear and anxiety, Bourke aptly highlights the boundaries between an \n\u2018immediate, objective threat\u2019 (fear) and an \u2018anticipated, subjective threat\u2019 \n                                                 \n39 See A.

Pavarini provides an analysis \nof this paradox, arguing that \u2018[i]nstitutional and public efforts to provide \nsafeguards against criminality are perceived as being unable to meet the social \ndemand for security; again, whether this is actually the case is another matter\u2019.47 \nFor example, a community such as Polish society traditionally could be defined \nas expecting the state to play a strong role in combating crime, in other words, \n\u2018punitive\u2019, a factor that dates back to pre-war period.

This paradox is aptly described by Kadare, who writes: \nEveryone realised that the material piling up inside them was contradictory \nand incoherent, to such a degree that even the most persistent analysis \nended up making the same gesture of despair as everyone else and \ndeclaring, with arms thrown wide: The only way you can get a grip on a \nplace overcome by paranoia is by becoming a little paranoid yourself.49 \n \nFormer dissident and president of former Czechoslovakia Vaclav Havel \nunderstood this process very well.50 Resistance against various modes of \nrepression in its tumultuous history has kept CEE societies, respective cultures, \nlanguages, and traditions alive under various conditions of oppression. These \nstrategies of resistance were both concrete and symbolic and very much an \nimportant part of the strategy for survival during long periods of imposed rule.51  \nAlongside this a state of anxiety exists, which the state, in its totalitarian \nand post-totalitarian form, recognises and exploits. \u2018A lot of tension accumulates \naround the quest for safety. And where there is a tension, political capital will \nsurely be spotted by bright investors and expedient stockbrokers\u2019.52 In sum, \n                                                 \n48 A.

Bauman, Globalisation: The Human Consequences (Cambridge 1998) p. 117. \n 12\ncrime control under Communist rule was characterised by terror and repression \nthat had its roots in the Stalinist period, which continued to exist under various \nguises until its collapse. Society had to adapt ways to cope with these measures \naimed at disciplining,53 yet at the same time held on to expectations that law and \norder would be maintained by the state.  \nThe effects of the totalitarian regime \u2013 \u2018one which is omnipotent, \nomnipresent, and which has no space for private freedom\u2019, 54 which presents \nitself as perfect, not flawless, contributes to its mystical nature: it does not need \nto be clear about power, compounded in the sense of uncertainty in dealing with \nthe unknown. \u0141o\u015b argues that the way in which crime was reported deprived \npeople of the tools to talk about their fears; instead crime remained a private \nissue.55 Indeed, no space was created for criticism; likewise, no space was \ncreated for the private citizen. In consequence, a fear of personal safety was \ncreated. This personal safety could be extended to the fear of personal liberty \nthat came with the introduction of democratic reforms. This factor has been used \nin media reporting and populist campaigns, as seen in the next section, which \nconsiders the paradoxical relationship in the post-Communist period, namely the \neffect of existing remnants of Communist rule on post-Communist crime control \nmodels. Alongside this EU enlargement has had its own peculiar effect as well. \n \n \n                                                 \n53 M.

Post-Communist period (1989 \u2013 present) \nPrevious research has demonstrated that the collapse of the Communist regime \nhas left particular bonds of resistance meaningless and replaced them with new \nthreats, manifested in the rising crime rates, which necessitate new strategies \nand ways of coping.56 These new strategies rely on old and well-used methods \nwhich on the part of Polish society involves retaining the label of \u2018them\u2019 as \nconcerns the state apparatus.  \n \n3.1 European identity and crime control \nThis label has been used to identify pro-European policies.57 European identity \nitself is a notion fraught with confusion. As concerns its identity in the criminal law \narea, research has revealed a cosmopolitanism that attaches itself to the identity \nof \u2018others\u2019 and the moral suffering the \u2018others\u2019 experience at the hands of states \nthat do not reflect the European \u2018civilisation\u2019.58 This highly debated process \ntowards \u2018civilising\u2019 argues that there are macro-sociological processes at work \nthat eventually result in a refinement and humanisation of penal measures that \nare more in line with values shared by the European community.59 Post-\nCommunist states have openly declared their affinity with \u2018Europe\u2019, some states \n                                                 \n56 See A. Fijalkowski (2005),loc. cit. \n57 This is apparent among right-wing political parties in CEE, such as the Polish Law and Justice \n(Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107) or Self-Defence (Samoobrona) parties mentioned below. \n58 See E.

A closer examination is warranted, with the \nstarting point being culture.61 \nGarland\u2019s work examines the manner in which shared values and norms \nhave affected forms of punishment in Europe and how the area of crime control \nhas been shaped by changing sensibilities and mentalities over time.62 The \norigins of these catalysts for change usually rest with external factors. In this \nvein, both the EU and CEE are affected by values and norms reflected in \nEuropean and international law. When the EU welcomed the post-Communist \nstates into \u2018Europe\u2019, it opened up formal discussions with the candidate \ncountries, drawing attention to the Copenhagen criteria of 1991, which sets out \nthe criteria for joining, namely by respecting the rule of law and democracy. The \nEU\u2019s momentum as concerns the \u2018promotion\u2019 of human rights took place in the \n1990s, and in 2001 the European Commission indicated that the \u2018European \nUnion is well placed to promote democracy and human rights\u2026all fifteen \nmember states of the Union are democracies espousing the same Treaty-based \nprinciples in their internal and external policies.\u201963 A common ground between \nmember states, enough to constitute a European identity, seemingly exists.

First, however, Member States had to ensure that these \nrelevant instruments were ratified between themselves. The newly selected \ncandidate countries were perplexed, as the majority of its populations strongly \nsupported the use of capital punishment. It created a rift between the \u2018East\u2019 and \n\u2018West\u2019, once again perplexing, as CEE has felt its place is in the \u2018West\u2019, because \nit shares common democratic values.  \n This is not the first time that CEE countries have felt excluded from \nWestern Europe. Although the question of geography is relevant, it needs to be \nunderstood alongside the \u2018double exclusion: from their own history thanks to the \nSoviet presence, and from the consciousness of the West.\u201965 Soviet rule \nestablished a divide between East and West. Entry into the European Union, as \nnoted above, creates a barrier as well, to the surprise of the CEE countries. Judt \ncaptures the sentiment well when he argues \u2018East European writings about West \nEurope in the early fifties [reveals] a reiterated tone of injury and bewildered \n                                                 \n64 E. Girling, loc. cit. \n 16\nsurprise: of \u2018disappointed love\u2019.66 With European enlargement, there was no \nquestion that CEE countries would seek membership. The \u2018wonders\u2019 that the \nWest could grant CEE was entangled in the concern about what the East would \ndo to the West.67 Cultural inclusiveness, it is argued, was met by technical \nexclusiveness.68 The latter, separating EU Member States from CEE states, is \nrooted in Communist practices, and also needs to be appreciated alongside \npeculiar cultural values. \nLerch and Schwellnus discuss the problems that arise when \u2018double \nstandards\u2019 come into question \u2013 in other words, the inconsistent application of \nrules\u2019.69 This practice does not necessarily lead to the loss of legitimacy, but if \nthe double standards remain unjustified the result might be different. How \nsuccessful the Council of Europe has been in convincing CEE states about \nadopting this correct crime control model is questionable. \n                                                                                                                                                \n \n3.2 Post-communist states and crime control \nConcerning the punitive nature of CEE societies, in the area of punishment the \nmajority of the CEE population has supported the death penalty for over a \ndecade, with the lowest percentage of supporters in 1989, at 52 per cent, rising \nto 77 per cent in 1996. For 2000, 58 per cent of respondents polled \u2018definitely\u2019 \nsupported the death penalty and 19 per cent responded with a \u2018rather yes\u2019; only 8 \n \n65 T.

Polls taken by the Brussels-\nbased Central European Research Group (CEORG) revealed that 73.6 per cent \nof Poles support the death penalty, alongside 59.8 per cent of Hungarians and \n56.1 per cent of Czechs (CEORG 2002).70 Without doubt, strong support for \ncapital punishment is reflected in the Central and East European region. \nIn Poland, for example, public views coincide with polls taken as far back \nas 1996, when respondents supported stricter laws under the former criminal \ncode.71 Sentiments favouring stricter laws coincide with the increasing fear of \nbecoming a victim of a crime, which has been revealed in recent surveys. In \n2000, for example, in another poll conducted by CBOS, two-thirds of Polish \nsociety expressed such fears.72 These fears are prompted by the fact that \ncriminal patterns have changed since the collapse of Communism. While criminal \nstatistics are notoriously difficult to evaluate, especially under the former regime, \nstudies demonstrate that the number of offences reported has doubled in the ten-\nyear period following the collapse of Communism.73 Further, it is important to \npoint out that the CEE does not share the EU\u2019s view that using the death penalty \nto fight crime is ineffective.74 Deterrence is a notion that is very much alive in the \nCEE region. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n69 M.

Personal safety \nwas perceived differently under the former regime. The reporting of crime and \ncriminal statistics were strictly controlled by the regime, which meant that only \ncertain crimes were reported, and mostly where crimes were solved and state \ncontrol reinforced.75 Latvia, for example, resisted the Council of Europe\u2019s \nurgency by clearly indicating that the increasing crime rates had to be comb\nby retaining the death penalty for a temporary period. Albania has argued \nated \n \nrally showed an increase \netween 10-16 per cent of fears of personal safety.  \n \n \nsimilarly. \n In its 2005 report in feelings of insecurity and fears of crime, the European \nCrime Prevention Network compared Western European states with CEE \ncountries,76 it was revealed that fears of personal safety were higher in CEE\ncountries as opposed to Western European states, including industrialised \ncountries.

In ce\ner role of the church in public life.  \nReturning to the Polish experience, one of the key institutions which \nsupported Poles in their struggle for independence during the Partitio\nCommunist rule has been the Catholic Church. For a society that is \npredominantly Catholic, the religious theme is not an accident, nor is the strong \nsense of statehood. Misztal ventures, \u2018[T]he partition of Poland in the eightee\ncentury gave the country an essential identity as \u201cthe Christ among nations: \ncrucified and recrucified by foreign oppression\u201d, and through this established \nprism of victimhood many Poles still interpret their national fate\u2019.79 The Church \nwas \u2018pushed on to the fringes of political life\u2019,80 during both the pre-war and post-\nwar periods.

In this respect, Poland is almost a uniform country.\u201990 \nThe commonly shared values extend to crime control, a point re-visited recently \nwith the capital sentence imposed by Iraqi courts against Saddam Hussein. The \nPolish President has been a strong advocate of re-introducing the sentence. \n\u2018Countries that give up this penalty award an unimaginable advantage to the \ncriminal over his victim, the advantage of life over death\u2019.91 This is advocated by \nother CEE countries, such as the Ukraine, which supports Iraq\u2019s sovereignty of \nthe question. The Council of Europe has responded that \u2018death penalty has no \nplace in the criminal justice system of any modern, civilised country\u2019.92 Some \ncommentators, such as Smith, observe that \u2018[w]hat the Council of Europe did was \nto exercise the coercive powers they had over these young, fragile, emerging \n                                                                                                                                                 \n89 These shifts in the character governance in Poland is not a new development. For example, the \nfirst Polish president, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa stylised himself very much as the pre-war President Josef \nPi\u0142sudski, an authoritarian leader who led a campaign of sanitation. These efforts, alongside \nconservative values, are what characterise the current regime and are the key to its popularity. \n90 See \u2018Government Starts Work\u2019, Warsaw Voice 2 August 2006 (see \nhttp:\/\/www.warsawvoice.pl\/view\/11969 ). \n91 C.S.

Future of democracy \nThe sentiments expressed by CEE countries reflect views on crime, risk, and \nsecurity. They indicate a direction in response to the dynamics of crime in a time\nof considerable social change. This is not only concentrated in the CEE region, \nindeed, a similar debate is ongoing across Europe and \u2018a number of Anglophone \n[\u2026.] governments [that] have increasingly sought to bring the general p\nal sentiments within their framework for policy development\u2019.95  \nThere seem to be good reasons to doubt existing arrangements in criminal \npolicy and institutions of social control that require reform.96 The European C\nPrevention Network\u2019s report shows that fears of crime are localised among\npeople who in actual fact are at low risk of being a victim of crime. Whilst \npractical measures can be instituted, the question remains that concerns a fear \nof crime and insecurity that is rooted in extended experience of the failure of the \n \n93 C.S.

This factor has been addressed with respect to Latin \nAmerica, where crime has risen at an alarming pace, and the implementation of \nmeasures, such as the appearance of more police has resulted in conflicting \nresults, from reducing public anxiety to an increased sense of fear.\n to \n \ne \nse, it \nf \n is \nis is \ne \n, yet some commentators, such as \n97 Likewi\nhas been shown that support for authoritarian regimes can stem from feelings o\ninsecurity and vulnerability.98 The decay in social relationships and trust\nassumed to constitute the specifically social dimensions of criminality.

This sort of discourse of political \nlegitimation that has been adopted by the media and politicians is reflected\nmany countries for the introduction or reintroduction of the death penalty, for \nincreased use of life imprisonment, or other repressive measures against \ncriminality.

Concluding remarks \nThis article examined crime, risk, and security in CEE during Communist and \npost-Communist rule. It considered the nature of Communist rule, shaped by \nrepressive measures and the use of terror, which affected the way in whi\nsocieties perceive law and order. In the post-Communist period the EU, \nparticularly through the Council of Europe, has played a significant role in calling\nupon CEE states to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. However, in\narea of crime control, there is a marked divergence in traditional and local \nconcerns as concerns crime and security, the extent to which they continue to\nshaped by Communist rule, the manner in which these assert themselves in \nmedia reporting and political campaigns, that are at odds with global patterns o\nthought.
