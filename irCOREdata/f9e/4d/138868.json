When 31 \ninoculated onto both the top and bottom faces of sliced commercially-prepared finished product, 32 \nthe results for all four temperatures showed a decrease of 0.9 to 1.4, 1.4 to 1.8, and 2.2 to 3.0 log\n \n33 \nCFU\/g for E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, over the 34 \ncourse of 21 days. With the possible exceptions for salt and carbohydrate levels, chemical 35 \nanalyses of teewurst purchased from five commercial manufacturers revealed only subtle 36 \ndifferences in proximate composition for this product type. Our data establish that teewurst does 37 \nnot provide a favourable environment for the survival of E. coli O157:H7, S.

Introduction 40 \nTeewurst is a traditional sausage of Germanic origin, typically made from pork and 41 \nbeef, that is characterized by a soft spreadable texture. It is usually manufactured by 42 \nsmall producers and sold under refrigeration as a raw spreadable meat (USDA, 1993, 43 \nUSDA, 2005). At present, there is a general lack of criteria for both the manufacture and 44 \nthe compositional descriptions for fresh and raw spreadable sausages, including teewurst 45 \n(Islam and Jockel, 2005). Teewurst is grouped with other meat products such as 46 \nmettwurst that display a relatively low acid content (e.g., pH 5.3-5.5) and high moisture 47 \ncontent (e.g., aw \u22650.95) (Brown, 2000). Processing and preparation of this product does 48 \nnot typically include any heat treatment or antimicrobial interventions other than the 49 \nsalts, spices, nitrites, and perhaps phenolics contributed by liquid smoke, that are added 50 \ndirectly to the batter (Brown, 2000). The teewurst manufactured in the USA is the same 51 \nas the teewurst produced in Germany, unless it is cooked, as is practiced by some 52 \nmanufacturers. As USA regulations stipulate, true product names and a \u201csafe handling 53 \nstatement\u201d must be accurately affixed to the label to provide consumers with the ability to 54 \nchoose between \u201cteewurst uncooked, cured meat spread\u201d or \u201ccooked teewurst\u201d, with the 55 \nformer being \u201craw\u201d. 56 \nThe association of teewurst with foodborne illnesses in recent years is well 57 \ndocumented (Ammon et al., 1999, Werber et al., 2006). In Germany, consumption of raw 58 \nspreadable sausages, including teewurst, was identified as a risk factor for sporadic 59 \nillnesses associated with Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) in persons aged 10 years 60 \nor older (Werber et al., 2006). Similarly, a large outbreak (28 cases, 3 deaths) of 61 \nhaemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by a sorbitol-fermenting strain of E. coli 62 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4 \nO157:H- was associated with consumption of teewurst, a raw pork product, and 63 \nmortadella, a cooked pork product (Ammon et al., 1999). Although teewurst is intended 64 \nto be cooked by the consumer, its production includes ingredients such as nitrites that 65 \ncause the raw sausage to appear as a ready-to-eat (RTE) product; therefore, teewurst is 66 \nnotoriously eaten without proper cooking, either by preference or by perception. In a 67 \nsurvey conducted in Germany in 2001 related to knowledge and handling of raw meat, 68 \nand in particular teewurst, ca. 50% of the 510 participants reported eating teewurst and, 69 \nsomewhat surprisingly, only ca. 36% of them recognised it as a raw meat product 70 \n(Bremer et al., 2005). Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the behaviour of E. coli 71 \nO157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes inoculated either into the batter or 72 \nonto the surface of sliced teewurst that was subsequently stored under aerobic conditions 73 \nat refrigeration and abuse temperatures. Proximate composition analyses of commercial 74 \nteewurst produced by five relatively small processors were also conducted to address the 75 \npotential variety and range of chemical traits, since a standard of identity does not 76 \ncurrently exist for this product. 77 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n5 \n2. Materials and methods 78 \n2.1. Bacterial strains 79 \nThe multi-strain cocktails of L. monocytogenes (MFS2, MFS102, MFS104, MFS105, and 80 \nMFS110), E. coli O157:H7 (EC505B, C7927, and SLH21788), and S. Typhimurium (H3278, 81 \nG7601, H3402, H2662, H3380, and G8430) used in this study were confirmed, cultured, 82 \ncombined, and\/or maintained as described previously (Porto-Fett et al., 2008a). 83 \n2.2. Formulation and manufacture of teewurst 84 \nThe formulation of teewurst batter, as purchased from a local manufacturer (Ernst A. Illg 85 \nMeats, Inc.; Chalfont, PA), consisted of certified pork trimmings (60 lbs; fat-lean ratio 70%-86 \n30%), boneless beef plates (40 lbs; fat-lean ratio 70%-30%), and 3.83 lbs of the following non-87 \nmeat ingredients: seasoning spices (First Spice Mixing Co., Long Island City, NY), sodium 88 \nnitrite curing salt, liquid smoke flavoring, paprika, cardamom, and sugar. The manufacturing 89 \nprocess for this brand of teewurst is shown in Figure 1. Chubs and slices of this brand of 90 \nfinished teewurst are shown in Figure 2. 91 \n2.3. Inoculation of teewurst batter 92 \n To simulate contamination at the processing plant, three batches (one batch per trial) of 93 \nfreshly-processed teewurst batter were separately inoculated with ca. 5.2 log CFU\/g of each 94 \nmulti-strain pathogen cocktail. After inoculation, the batter was mixed at ambient temperature 95 \n(22\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) using a commercial countertop mixer (Univex SRM12; Salem, NH) for ca. 2 min to 96 \nensure for relatively even distribution of the inoculum. The batter was stuffed using a 97 \ncommercial (manual) stuffer (D-73779; Dick, Deizisau, Germany) into commercial 4.5 cm 98 \ndiameter artificial \u201cfibrous\u201d casings (F Plus; Walsroder GMBH, Germany) in portions of ca. 99 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n6 \n100 g. The resulting chubs were stored at 1.5, 4, 10, or 21\u00b0C for up to 30 days. In each of the 100 \nthree trials two chubs were sampled at each sampling interval (N = 3 trials; n = 2 101 \nreplicates\/chubs per sampling interval per trial). It should be noted that the terms \u201cbatter\u201d and 102 \n\u201cchub\u201d herein refer to teewurst inoculated prior to stuffing. 103 \n2.4. Inoculation of the surface of teewurst slices 104 \nTo simulate post-process contamination in the home or in a food service establishment, 105 \nthree batches (one batch per trial) of freshly-processed teewurst were obtained from our 106 \ncollaborating manufacturer as above. Teewurst was transferred aseptically from the original 107 \npackages onto sterile styrofoam trays (1012S; Genpak, Glens Falls, NY) and sliced (ca. 20 g 108 \neach slice, ca. 5 cm diameter) with the aid of an ethanol-sterilized knife. Individual slices were 109 \nplaced onto styrofoam trays (Genpak) and separately inoculated on the top surface of each slice 110 \nwith 50 \u00b5l of each multi-strain pathogen cocktail.  Cells were then distributed with the aid of a 111 \nsterile plastic cell spreader (Midsci; St. Louis, MO). The trays containing the inoculated 112 \nteewurst were placed into a biological safety cabinet and held for ca. 15 min at ambient 113 \ntemperature (22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) to allow for the inocula to better attach to the meat slices. Next, the 114 \nslices were inverted and the process was repeated on the opposite side. The final concentration 115 \nof each pathogen was ca. 4.5 log\n \nCFU\/g. Inoculated slices (one slice per bag) were then placed 116 \ninto sterile polyethylene bags (Ziploc Brand Snack Bags; S.C. Johnson Products, Inc., Racine 117 \nWI). The bags were stored at 1.5, 4, 10, or 21\u00b0C for up to 21 days. In each of the three trials two 118 \nbags\/slices were sampled at each sampling interval (N = 3 trials; n = 2 replicates\/slices per 119 \nsampling interval per trial). 120 \n2.5. Microbiological analyses 121 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n7 \n Initial and final populations of total plate count (TPC) and total lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 122 \nwere enumerated on slices and in chubs as follows. A total of three slices (ca. 20 g each) or 123 \nthree chubs (ca. 5 g each), from each of the three trials\/batches tested, were separately 124 \ntransferred into plastic two-chamber filter stomacher bags (Fisherbrand; Fisher Scientific, 125 \nPittsburgh, PA) containing 15 or 45 ml of 0.1% sterile peptone water (Difco, Becton, Dickinson 126 \nand Co., Sparks, MD), respectively, and stomached for ca. 2 min (Stomacher 400; Seward, 127 \nCincinnati, OH). The TPC were enumerated by spread-plating 100 \u00b5l of the resulting slurry, 128 \nwith or without prior dilution in sterile peptone water, onto Brain Heart Infusion agar plates 129 \n(BHI; Difco,) and aerobic incubation at 30\u00b0C for 72 h. For enumeration of LAB, appropriate 130 \ndilutions of the slurry were spread-plated (100 \u00b5l) onto deMan Rogosa Sharpe agar (MRS; 131 \nDifco) and incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 72 h (10.1% carbon dioxide, 4.38% hydrogen 132 \nand the balance in nitrogen; Bactron IV Anaerobic\/Environmental Chamber; Sheldon 133 \nManufacturing Inc., Cornelius, OR).   134 \nFor enumeration of E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes from 135 \nteewurst, the inoculated slices and chubs were sampled at periodic intervals and treated as 136 \nabove and appropriate dilutions of the resulting slurry were surface-plated (100 \u00b5l) onto 137 \nModified Oxford agar for enumeration of L. monocytogenes (MOX; Difco), MacConkey 138 \nsorbitol agar for enumeration of E. coli O157:H7 (SMAC; Difco), and xylose lysine tergitol-4 139 \nagar for enumeration of S. Typhimurium (XLT4; Difco). Typical colonies of each pathogen 140 \nwere counted after aerobic incubation of plates at 37\u00b0C for 48 h (MOX) or 24 h (SMAC and 141 \nXLT4). When pathogen numbers in batter decreased to \u22641.0 log CFU\/g by direct plating, their 142 \npresence or absence were determined by enrichment as described (Porto-Fett et al., 2008a). 143 \n2.6.

Statistical analyses 154 \nMicrobial counts were transformed to logarithms before means and standard deviations 155 \nwere computed, and counts were reported in terms of log CFU\/g. When bacterial counts in 156 \nteewurst batter decreased to below the threshold of detection (\u22641.0 log CFU\/g), a value of 1 was 157 \nused for positive samples after enrichment for determination of the arithmetic mean. Statistical 158 \nanalyses were performed using the SPSS 12.0 software program for windows (SPSS Inc., 159 \nChicago, IL). For each contamination scenario and pathogen an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 160 \nwas performed to evaluate the effect of storage time and temperature on pathogen viability. 161 \nDifferences in the proximate composition of teewurst manufactured by different processors 162 \nwere also evaluated using ANOVA.

The 171 \naverage initial TPC and LAB levels were 7.2 \u00b1 0.7 and 5.7 \u00b1 0.9  log CFU\/g, 172 \nrespectively, for teewurst batter, whereas for teewurst slices the average initial TPC and 173 \nLAB levels were 6.5 \u00b1 0.7 and 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 log\n \nCFU\/g, respectively (Table 1).

Average inital aw values 177 \nwere about 0.960 (SD \u22640.005) for both slices and batter, and aw changed relatively little 178 \nover the storage period.

E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes levels 191 \ndecreased to below the level of detection by both direct plating (\u22641.0 log CFU\/g) and 192 \nenrichment after 25 and 18 days of storage at 21\u00b0C, respectively. S. Typhimurium levels 193 \ndecreased below detectable levels by direct plating within 15, 18, and 11 days at 1.5, 4, 194 \nand 10\u02daC, respectively. The absence of S.

In general, S.

Storage at 1.5, 201 \n4, 10, and 21\u00b0C for up to 21 days resulted in reductions of E. coli O157:H7 and S. 202 \nTyphimurium from ca. 4.8 log CFU\/g to 3.7, 3.7, 3.9, and 3.4 log CFU\/g and from ca. 4.3 203 \nlog CFU\/g to 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, and 2.7 log CFU\/g, respectively. When slices were inoculated 204 \nwith L. monocytogenes and stored at 1.5, 4, 10, and 21\u00b0C for up to 21 days, pathogen 205 \nnumbers decreased from ca. 4.5 log CFU\/g to 1.8, 2.3, 1.8, and 1.5 log CFU\/g, 206 \nrespectively.

Proximate composition analyses also revealed that teewurst in general 228 \nhas relatively low nitrite and salt levels and a relatively high moisture and high fat 229 \ncontent, characteristics that typically do not provide a sufficient barrier to microbial 230 \npersistence in such products.  231 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n12 \n4. Discussion 232 \nTeewurst is a very popular traditional\/ethnic sausage, typically consumed raw, that 233 \nremains in demand, albeit in the face of generally declining sales (Ernst K. Illg, personal 234 \ncommunication). It is produced by a limited number of small plants that are located 235 \nprimarily in the northeast and upper midwest regions of the USA. From a public health 236 \nperspective spreadable sausages such as teewurst are considered to be higher-risk 237 \nproducts, presumably because consumers are not aware of the safe-handling requirements 238 \nfor teewurst as a product that may contain raw meat (Bremer et al., 2005) and\/or due to 239 \ntheir preference to consume it \u201cas is\u201d. In recent years, consumption of teewurst has 240 \ncaused human illnesses due to its contamination with E. coli O157:H7 and L. 241 \nmonocytogenes and, therefore, such products may potentially be a vehicle for harborage 242 \nand\/or transmission of foodborne pathogens (Brown, 2000; FAO, 2004; Goulet et al., 243 \n2002; Pichner et al., 2004; Timm et al., 1999). If opened\/sampled, teewurst has a 244 \nrefrigerated shelflife of ca. 1 (Campbell-Platt, 1995; Ockerman and Basu, 2007) to 5 245 \ndays (Brown, 2000), whereas if left unopened the shelf life could extend for up to 7 to 21 246 \ndays at 4\u00b0C (Ernst K. Illg, personal communication). In the present study, however, 247 \nvisible mold-like spoilage was evident on teewurst slices within 21 days of refrigerated 248 \nstorage (1.5 and 4\u00b0C) or within 5 days of storage at abuse temperatures (10 and 21\u00b0C). 249 \nRegardless, pathogen levels decreased during storage; however, in the event of post-250 \nprocess contamination with relatively high levels of these pathogens, as seen for other 251 \nmeat products, teewurst could possibly expose some consumers to a heath risk 252 \n(Gounadaki et al., 2007; Matargas et al., 20008; Yang et al., 2006). 253 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n13 \nLevels of E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes decreased 254 \nappreciably in teewurst chubs during storage for 30 days (Table 2). Greater reductions in 255 \npathogens numbers were observed at 10 and 21\u00b0C as compared to 1.5 and 4\u00b0C. However, 256 \nat the end of storage, with the exception of S. Typhimurium for which the most 257 \nsignificant lethality was observed, surviving numbers of each pathogen were of similar 258 \nlevels. Moreover, in agreement with related studies conducted on salami and soudjouk 259 \n(Nightingale et al., 2006; Porto-Fett et al., 2008b), S. Typhimurium inoculated into 260 \nteewurst batter\/chubs was less viable than L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7. 261 \nLethality may be attributed to the presence of native LAB in addition to antimicrobial 262 \ningredients such as nitrites, since according to R\u00f6del et al. (Rodel and Scheuer, 2006) 263 \ninhibition of E. coli in short fermented raw spreadable sausages was enhanced due to the 264 \nacidification of the product by LAB and ensuing reduction of aw, whereas the presence of 265 \nsodium nitrite had only a weak effect. Similar findings were reported by Birzele et al. 266 \n(Birzele et al., 2005), who found that nitrite at levels of 0.5 or 0.9% incorporated into 267 \nfresh spreadable ham and onion sausage inhibited growth of Salmonella Enteritidis, E. 268 \ncoli, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as partially inhibited L. monocytogenes. The 269 \nproliferation and metabolic activity of LAB are known to inhibit undesirable bacteria, 270 \nmainly through the production of lactic acid and the subsequent pH reduction of foods, 271 \nbut also by the production of CO2, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, diacetyl, and\/or 272 \nbacteriocins (Hugas, 1998). The batch-to-batch levels and diversity of LAB naturally 273 \npresent in raw meat and associated microbial interactions (i.e. chemical changes in 274 \nproduct) could possibly explain the observed variability in lethality for each pathogen 275 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n14 \namong trials and between chubs and slices (Comi et al., 2005; Kaya et al., 2004; 276 \nSkandamis et al., 2007). 277 \nThe findings of the present study suggest that inclusion of a defined lactic starter 278 \nculture(s) and perhaps a limited\/controlled fermentation during manufacture would 279 \nimprove the reproducibility from batch-to-batch and enhance both the quality and safety 280 \nof the finished product (Calicioglu et al., 2001; Lucke, 2000). As previously reported, 281 \nfermentation of a German-style uncooked sausage (24\u00b0C\/24 h) followed by smoking 282 \n(22\u00b0C\/20 h) resulted in a 2.0- to 3.0-log reduction of L. monocytogenes (Farber et al., 283 \n1993). In fact, fermentation of some spreadable raw sausages in Germany constitutes a 284 \ncritical element of the manufacturing process so as to insure that the final product is 285 \ncharacterised by an appropriate flavour, colour, texture, and acidification level (\u2264pH 5.6; 286 \nD-lactic acid \u2265 0.2 g\/100 g; Islam and Jockel, 2005). In the case of teewurst, however, 287 \nthe addition of a starter culture and the ensuing production of organic acid(s) and other 288 \ncompounds could possibly have an untoward effect on product taste, that being too sour, 289 \nand on product texture, that being too firm and, as such, less spreadable (Ernst K. Illg, 290 \npersonal communication, 2008). Thus, it may be prudent to consider adding food grade 291 \nchemicals as an ingredient to further enhance the wholesomeness of teewurst. In fact, in 292 \nprefatory studies we observed an immediate decrease of ca. 1.6 log CFU\/g of L. 293 \nmonocytogenes in the presence of 5.5 ppm of nisin added directly to the teewurst batter; 294 \nhowever, no further decrease in pathogen levels was observed during storage at 4 or 10\u00b0C 295 \nover 10 days of storage (data not shown). Regardless, the need for a more precise 296 \nstandard of identity was evident from the differences among brands in the various 297 \nphysicochemical traits measured, as well as from differences in the information included 298 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n15 \non product labels (Table 4 and 5).  In the absence of any readily accessible and\/or 299 \npublished information, the data in Tables 4 and 5 may serve as a starting point for 300 \nassisting in the development of a list of ingredients and range of attendant concentrations 301 \nfor defining a standard of identity for teewurst. 302 \nTo our knowledge, there is limited scientific literature on the fate of E. coli 303 \nO157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes either \u201con\u201d or \u201cin\u201d teewurst. This 304 \nstudy provides valuable information to small and very small plants producing teewurst 305 \nand to regulatory authorities overseeing its production for assessing product safety from 306 \nthese foodborne pathogens. The need to establish both a standard of identity and 307 \nguidelines for its manufacture are critical given that teewurst is typically a raw rather than 308 \nRTE   product, as well as given that despite labeling instructions to the contrary, this 309 \nproduct is commonly\/openly ingested as raw without cooking. The data herein also 310 \nhighlight the need to educate both producers and consumers as to the appropriate manner 311 \nto produce\/handle and store teewurst so as not to introduce pathogens at any point from 312 \nproduction through to consumption. 313 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n \n16 \nAcknowedgments 314 \nThe authors thank the following individuals for contributing their time, talents, 315 \nresources, and\/or opinions to this work: Rosemary Martinjuk, Peggy Williamson, Nelly 316 \nOsario, Renata Jacob, Ellen Sanders, and John Philips, all of the U.S. Department of 317 \nAgriculture, Agricultural Research Service at the Eastern Regional Research Center in 318 \nWyndmoor, PA.
