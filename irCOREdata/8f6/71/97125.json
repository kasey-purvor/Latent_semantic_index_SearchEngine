Introduction\nBacteria such as Escherichia coli, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Bacillus subtilus1 re-\nspond to extracellular changes in their environment by biased random motion towards at-\ntractants or away from repellents. Such movement is commonly referred to as chemotaxis\nand was first reported as early as the late nineteenth century (Engelmann, 1881a, 1881b;\nPfeffer, 1888). In the last 40 years, bacterial chemotaxis has been an area of increasing\ninterest to both experimentalists and theoreticians. This interest has been fueled by ever-\nincreasing experimental insight into the behavior of bacteria, both on the population and\nindividual scale, coupled with insight provided by new and more detailed mathematical\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: tindallm@maths.ox.ac.uk (M.J.

The\nautophosphorylation of CheA is controlled by the receptor array in response to either gradients of attrac-\ntant or repellent. In the absence of an attractant or presence of a repellent gradient, the receptors activate\nCheA autophosphorylation. Phosphotransfer to CheY causes a rise in phosphorylated CheY (CheYP )\nlevels which promotes clockwise rotation of the flagella leading to tumbling. Adaptation is controlled\nby methylation of the receptors. CheR acts to methylate receptors and phosphorylated CheB (CheBP )\ndemethylates them. In the absence of an attractant gradient, both exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Detection\nof an attractant gradient leads to cessation of the autophosphorylation of CheA and a decrease in CheYP\nconcentration causing counter-clockwise rotation of the flagella which leads to chemotactic runs. Simulta-\nneously, a decrease in CheBP levels allows the receptors to become methylated which leads to activation\nof CheA autophosphorylation, thus re-setting the system to its pre-stimulus state.\nmodels, at various scales. The fundamental challenges today are in seeking to provide an\nappropriate description on the macroscale population level while accounting for variation\nin specific characteristics amongst individual cells.\nIndividual bacteria are generally 1\u20133 \u00b5m in length; they are too short to detect a change\nin attractant gradient along their length so they use a well-defined biochemical network\nto communicate the detected temporal difference in the extracellular environment at the\nmembrane receptors to the flagellar motors (Wadhams and Armitage, 2004; Tindall et al.,\n2007). Although the biochemical processes are well documented within the cytoplasm\nof E. coli as shown in Fig. 1, the ability of the bacterium to detect small changes in\nthe extracellular concentration over large orders of magnitude has raised a number of\nchallenging and interesting research questions.\nIn the absence of any stimulus, E. coli undergoes a random walk alternating periods\nof smooth swimming with brief direction changes known as tumbles. Increased attractant\n1572 Tindall et al.\nFig. 2 Aggregation of chemotactic bacteria in regions of high attractant concentration as originally shown\nby Pfeffer (1888).\nconcentration suppresses tumbling and leads to biasing of the random walk allowing the\nbacteria to accumulate in environments containing high attractant concentrations. This\nresults in periods of biased directed motion known as runs. Chemotactic runs generally\nlast on the order of a few seconds while tumbles last approximately tenths of seconds\n(Berg and Turner, 1990). A combination of runs, allowing directed motion to a response,\nand tumbles, facilitating a change in direction, allow bacteria to explore and respond to\nchanges in their environment.\nUnderstanding the behavior of chemotactic bacterial populations is interesting for a\nnumber of reasons. While bacteria behave independently, populations exhibit collective\nbehavior as shown in Fig. 2. In the natural environment, bacterial populations are gener-\nally found to exist in the form of biofilms which can have substantial impact upon industry\nand medicine (Davey and O\u2019Toole, 2000). Hence, understanding the comparative impor-\ntance of mechanisms which affect and cause the observed behavior within bacterial pop-\nulations, for example, chemotaxis and diffusion, would greatly facilitate in the prediction\nof bacterial behavior in the natural environment.\nThe focus of our work here is to consider the mathematical modeling work which has\naimed to understand the behavior of bacterial populations. Such work has been developed\nvery much in parallel with experimental work over the last 30 years. Experimental results\nhave been used to inform mathematical models and the resulting model solutions have\nhelped in understanding the observed behavior of populations. Much of the in vitro exper-\nimental work has been undertaken using a number of different experimental assay meth-\nods. We provide a brief overview of the more commonly used assays, in particular, those\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1573\nFig. 3 Schematic representations of: (a) the capillary assay of Adler (1966) as adapted from Rivero-Hudec\nand Lauffenburger (1986); and (b) the stop flow diffusion chamber (SFDC) method developed by Ford and\nLauffenburger (1991b). In (a), an attractant is loaded in the capillary before being placed in the bacterial\nsuspension. The attractant then diffuses out into the bacterial suspension and bacteria are attracted towards\nit. The figure represents the experimental set-up just after the capillary has been placed in the assay. In\n(b), dilute bacterial suspensions are initially pumped into the regions above and below (with attractant) the\njunction point using the syringe pump. Fluid flowing into the top and bottom of the chamber exits through\nslits at the junction. The impinging flow creates an \u2018interface\u2019 between the two suspensions and maintains\nthe attractant in the lower region of the chamber creating a step profile. When the flow is stopped, the\nattractant diffuses into the upper region allowing the bacterial response to be measured. The nylon spheres\nensure the flow is distributed evenly throughout the chamber. Adapted from the original diagram in Ford\nand Lauffenburger (1991b).\nwhich have been used to test and parameterize certain mathematical models.2 Schematic\nrepresentations of each of the following experimental assays are shown in Fig. 3.\n\u2022 Adler (1966) developed the capillary assay method in which a capillary tube containing\na chemoattractant was placed in a dilute bacterial suspension. The bacteria were then\nobserved to move up the tube in the direction of the attractant gradient forming bands\nas they did so. This assay has since become one of the most widely used methods for\nstudying the response of bacterial populations to chemoattractants and in testing and\nvalidating mathematical models developed to describe bacterial chemotaxis (Lewus and\nFord, 2001). A considerable amount of theoretical work has focused on understanding\nthe formation of bacterial bands as detailed in Section 2.2. Difficulties with this assay\nmethod include the inability to control the attractant gradient, counting the number\nof bacteria which have entered the capillary and the large variations in the number of\nbacteria entering the capillary between measurements.\n\u2022 Dahlquist et al. (1972) used a laser densitometer assay to study the effect that varying\nprofiles of attractant (exponential, step, and linear) have on the response of the bacterial\ncolony. A helium\u2013neon laser was used to detect the change in density of the bacterial\npopulation as it moved through the chamber.\n2For a more detailed overview of these and other assays, see Ford and Lauffenburger (1991b).\n1574 Tindall et al.\n\u2022 The stopped flow diffusion chamber (SFDC) was developed by Ford and co-workers\n(Ford and Lauffenburger, 1991b; Ford et al., 1991) to compare the response of bacteria\nto well-defined attractant gradients (step) and to obtain improved quantitative estimates\nof the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients associated with bacterial migration.\nThis review considers the formulation of early models in understanding Adler\u2019s observed\nbands of chemotactically migrating bacteria in capillary assays through to more recent\nwork on the multiscale modeling of bacterial populations. We note that while chemotaxis\nis a wide area of research both within the biological and applied mathematical litera-\nture, we do not seek to provide an overview of the general modeling of chemotaxis, or\nthe analysis of such models, from either a general biological or mathematical perspec-\ntive. Our goal is to understand the contribution of mathematical modeling in elucidating\nthe mechanisms responsible for the behavior of chemotactic bacterial populations. Work\nwhich has considered modeling the movement of bacteria through porous media (e.g.\nReynolds et al., 1989 and Hornberger et al., 1992) or that related specifically to the study\nof biofilms lies outside our remit and is not considered here.\nWe begin by considering continuum models of bacterial chemotaxis, in particular, the\napplication of the Keller and Segel (1971a) model of chemotaxis, originally developed\nin the context of modeling slime molds, in describing the movement and behavior of\nchemotactic bacteria. Section 2.2 focuses on the various models developed over the past\n30 years to understand Adler\u2019s observed bands of migrating bacteria within the capil-\nlary assay. Early work on modeling bacterial movement right through to more recent\nattempts have sought to understand the effect that individual bacteria have on the overall\nresponse of the bacterial population, often referred to as multiscale modeling. Such work\nis reviewed in Section 3. Work undertaken in understanding the behavior of more than a\ncolony of one bacterial species is considered in Section 4. Issues regarding the interaction\nof bacteria populations with their surrounding environment are reviewed in Section 5 and\nwe briefly discuss the importance of modeling pattern formation in bacterial populations\nin Section 6. An overview of the various mechanisms which have been incorporated in\nKeller\u2013Segel models of bacterial chemotaxis, and their various mathematical forms, is\ngiven in Appendix A. Our work concludes with discussion on the role that mathematical\nmodeling can play in the future research of bacterial chemotaxis.\nOur review provides an example of the development of mathematical models: initial\nmodeling efforts are sometimes later viewed as simplistic due to growing knowledge both\nmathematically and experimentally, which leads to more and more sophisticated mod-\nels. Various effects within these models are quantified by testing various forms of certain\nfunctions (see Appendix A), as clearly demonstrated in the following section on modeling\nbacterial bands. In essence, different models are tested and those which prove inadequate\nare discarded. With growing experimental knowledge and the development of new tech-\nniques, in particular, those covered in the later stages of our discussion in Section 3, the\neffects of individual cell behavior on the population scale can be elucidated, likewise the\nvalidity of earlier macroscale approaches.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1575\n2. Continuum models of a single population\n2.1. The Keller\u2013Segel model of chemotaxis\nContinuum models (particularly early models of bacterial populations) have generally\nused the Keller\u2013Segel model of chemotaxis, originally devised by Keller and Segel\n(1970, 1971a) in modeling the movement of slime molds. Such models have been an-\nalyzed using a mix of analytical techniques, for instance, traveling wave and perturbation\nanalysis, and numerical simulations. Numerical solutions have often been employed to\nallow model predictions to be compared with experimental findings, leading to bounds on\nmodel parameters (see Section 7).\nFor the purposes of this review, we consider a generalized Keller\u2013Segel (K\u2013S) model\nof the form\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03bc(s)\u2207b) \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c7(s)b\u2207s) + g(b, s) \u2212 h(b, s), (1)\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n= D\u22072s \u2212 f (b, s), (2)\nwhere b = b(x, t) is the density of the bacterial population, s = s(x, t) is the attrac-\ntant concentration at spatial position x and time t , \u03bc(s) is the bacterial diffusion coef-\nficient, \u03c7(s) is the chemotactic coefficient, g(b, s) and h(b, s) are functions describing\ncell growth and death, respectively, f (b, s) is a function describing attractant degrada-\ntion, and D is the diffusion coefficient of the attractant. For the remainder of this paper,\nthese symbolic representations will stand unless otherwise stated. Many models have as-\nsumed that \u03bc(s) = \u03bc, i.e. the bacterial diffusion coefficient is considered to be constant.\nThis will be assumed to be the case for all of the models discussed in the forthcoming\nsections unless otherwise specified.\nEquations (1) and (2) are solved for initial bacterial and attractant distributions, de-\nnoted here as b(x, t = 0) = b0 and s(x, t = 0) = s0, respectively, and appropriate bound-\nary conditions. Boundary conditions are dependent upon the assay being modeled. In gen-\neral, Neumann conditions apply at the ends of finite regions for both the bacterial density\nand attractant concentration. For instance, in modeling chemotactic bands of bacteria in a\ncapillary assay (see the following section), Keller and Segel (1971b) applied such condi-\ntions to the bacterial density and attractant concentration at the ends of a tube of length L.\nFor the SFDC experiments, Ford et al. (1991) applied Neumann conditions at the upper\nand lower ends of the chamber to the bacteria and attractant. These are but some examples\nand in the following, the reader is directed to the respective references for further details.\nIn general, growth and death of bacteria occur over a longer timescale than the dura-\ntion of many in vitro experiments. Hence their effects are often ignored when developing\nmathematical models. However, some authors have considered the effect they may have\non the dynamics of the bacterial distribution on both short and long timescales (Lauffen-\nburger et al., 1981).\nIn referring to Eqs. (1) and (2) as a generalized K\u2013S model, we include any model\nwhich assumes bacteria move by chemotaxis and diffusion and where the chemoattrac-\ntant is described by an equation in the form of (2). Various forms of the K\u2013S model have\nbeen used in modeling a wide range of biological systems. Recent reviews by Horstmann\n(2003a, 2003b) have focused on the contribution the K\u2013S model has made to understand-\ning chemotaxis within biological systems.\n1576 Tindall et al.\n2.2. Modeling chemotactic bands of bacteria\nThe formation of chemotactic bands of bacteria3 is often observed in the capillary assay,\nas shown in Fig. 4(a). Modeling the formation of such bands has generally explored the\neffect that the comparative strength of chemotaxis and diffusion of the population and the\ndiffusion and consumption of nutrient have on the overall bacterial density distribution,\nboth dynamically and in steady-state. The effects that the functional form of the bacterial\nchemotactic \u03c7(s) and diffusion \u03bc coefficients, and to some degree, the rate of nutrient\nconsumption have on the bacterial distribution has been explored by a number of authors.\nA full overview of the respective models and a comparison of the different functions is\ngiven in Appendix A.\nKeller and Segel (1971b) were the first to formulate a model to describe the formation\nof chemotactic bands as observed by Adler (1966). Using a model of the form given by\nEqs. (1) and (2), Keller and Segel (1971b) assumed that the bacteria did not reproduce\nduring the timescale of interest and responded to a single substrate of attractant which\ndid not diffuse. In order to reproduce the observed bands, they assumed a chemotactic\ncoefficient of the form\n\u03c7(s) = \u03c7\ns\n. (3)\nThis is singular when s = 0 and leads to a peak in the bacterial density. Keller and Segel\n(1971b) noted this form of the chemotactic coefficient allows the model to predict band\nbehavior (traveling wave solutions) in the bacterial density profiles when the concentra-\ntion of s is such that a continuum description is no longer adequate, the only condition\nbeing that \u03c7\/\u03bc > 1. Holz and Chen (1979) demonstrated that the model of Keller and\nSegel (1971b) provides an adequate description of bacterial migration in the bacterial re-\nsponse of E. coli to serine. They derived estimates for \u03bc and \u03c7 when the chemotactic\ncoefficient is of the form in Eq. (3), by comparing the model with their experimental\nresults.\nNumerical simulations of the model developed by Keller and Segel (1971b) were un-\ndertaken by Scribner et al. (1974). Their motivation was to test whether the model was\nappropriate for describing bacterial chemotaxis by comparing numerical solutions with\nthe experimental results of Adler (1966). They argued that more biologically realistic\nforms of the attractant consumption rate, chemotactic and diffusion coefficients should\ndepend upon a critical attractant concentration level a, such that\nf (b, s) = f0(as)m, s \u2264 1\/a; f (b, s) = f0, s > 1\/a;\n\u03c7(s) = \u03c7(as)i\/s, s \u2264 1\/a; \u03c7(s) = \u03c7\/s, s > 1\/a; (4)\n\u03bc(s) = \u03bc0(as)n, s \u2264 1\/a; \u03bc(s) = \u03bc0, s > 1\/a;\nwhere i,m, and n are all positive real numbers. They further assumed that the attractant\nwas free to diffuse throughout the spatially confined region of interest. Scribner et al.\n(1974) compared their model solutions with Adler\u2019s results for varying initial conditions\n3Also referred to as \u2018Adler\u2019 bands in recognition of their initial discovery by Adler in the context of the\ncapillary assay method (Adler, 1966, 1969)\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1577\nFig. 4 (a) The bacterial response of Rhodobacter sphaeroides to an oxygen gradient (aerotaxis) (Romag-\nnoli, 2002). The bands of bacteria (marked by the arrow) can be seen on the left of the photo as they\nmove toward an optimal oxygen concentration away from the miniscus of the capillary (and the oxygen\nsource) on the right. Here the tip of the arrow head is 1.3 mm away from the bottom (left hand edge) of\nthe meniscus. (b) Swarm plates of E. coli showing the formation of concentric bacterial rings (Armitage\nLaboratory). The petri dish has a diameter of 90 mm.\nand showed that the K\u2013S model predicts both uniform and non-uniform bands of chemo-\ntactic bacteria. The experimental data made quantitative comparison with the model dif-\nficult due to \u201cfluctations in the number of bacteria\u201d used in each experiment, but qualita-\ntive comparisons showed good agreement. Decreasing the chemotactic coefficient meant\nbands took longer to form and contained fewer bacteria. If the chemotactic exponent i\nis increased, chemotaxis decreases more rapidly when the attractant concentration drops\nbelow the transition level of attractant concentration at s = 1\/a. Increasing the attractant\ntransition level meant bands took longer to form and contained fewer bacteria. It was\nnoted that the initial bacterial density does not greatly affect the results.\nNossal (1972) modeled the movement of the edges of bacterial colonies growing and\nmoving in soft agar (commonly referred to as swarm plates). Initially, bacteria are placed\n1578 Tindall et al.\nat the center of a petri dish which with time migrate outwards, the population increasing at\na certain rate, to form concentric chemotactic rings as shown in Fig. 4(b). Nossal formu-\nlated a K\u2013S model which included cell growth and obtained various analytical estimates\ndescribing the position of the bacterial front, when it is assumed to be smooth, as it moves\nthrough the attractant. He noted that exact solutions could be obtained in the case of ex-\nponential growth. A general solution was obtained when the bacterial front was assumed\nto be sharp. We note here that given the difference in timescales of the experiments (capil-\nlary assays are of the order of minutes or hours whereas swarm plate assays can be carried\nout over days) growth terms can in the case of capillary assays be neglected, whereas they\nmay be important when modeling swarm plates.\nSegel and Jackson (1973), Nossal and Weis (1973), and Lapidus and Schiller (1974)\nformulated K\u2013S models to explain the experimental observations of Dahlquist, Lovely,\nand Koshland (DLK) (Dahlquist et al., 1972) regarding chemotaxis of Salmonella ty-\nphimurium in an assay analogous to that of the capillary assay. Segel and Jackson (1973)\nconsidered the relative strengths of diffusion and chemotaxis on model solutions com-\npared to the DLK experiments. They noted that constant rates of diffusion and chemotaxis\nwere only valid in the case of a population of identical organisms and individual response\nto chemoattractants would result in a variance in the overall population response. They\ndiscussed why chemotaxis leads to wider band formation and noted that analytical solu-\ntions, for various asymptotic limits of the governing equations, agreed with most of the\nDLK experiments. Segel and Jackson (1973) concluded that a chemotactic coefficient of\nthe form (3) was adequate for describing some of the DLK experiments when the varia-\ntion in s is small and stressed that knowledge of the microscopic behavior is important in\nmacroscopic theories of bacterial chemotaxis.\nThe model of Nossal and Weis (1973) considered a description of bacteria moving\nin an exponential, time independent gradient. This simplification allowed analytical so-\nlutions for the bacterial density distribution to be derived and values for the chemotactic\nand diffusion coefficients to be determined from comparison with experimental results.\nLapidus and Schiller (1974) noted that the analysis of Segel and Jackson (1973) and\nNossal and Weis (1973) was not able to describe the long term behavior of the bacterial\ncolony and further argued that the chosen boundary conditions were not representative of\nthe experimental set-up. Formulating a similar model to that of Nossal and Weis (1973),\nwith revised boundary conditions, they showed the long time behavior of their revised\nmodel agreed well with the experimental data. In particular, the bacterial density curve\nincreased at a rate proportional to the square root of time and bacteria moving into the\ncentral region of the assay increased the bacterial density proportional to the elapsed time\nof the experiment.\nWork by Lapidus and Schiller (1975, 1976) continued to focus on the DLK exper-\niments. In 1975, they noted that their previous work (Lapidus and Schiller, 1974) had\nshown that diffusion theory alone could reproduce the DLK observations and had the ex-\nperiments been for longer, then the precise form of the chemotactic coefficient would have\nbeen important. They discussed the importance of solutions involving chemotaxis match-\ning with experimental observations and posed the question \u201cIf after choosing a suitable\n\u03c7 , theory does not match experiment, then is it the choice of \u03c7 or the model itself which\nis inadequate?\u201d Further work (Lapidus and Schiller, 1976) noted that the earlier work of\nSegel and Jackson (1973), Nossal and Weis (1973) and Lapidus and Schiller (1974) using\nthe original K\u2013S formulation did not successfully predict all of the experiments observed\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1579\nby Dahlquist et al. (1972). Noting this and considering the experimental work of Mesibov\net al. (1973) and Brown and Berg (1974), Lapidus and Schiller (1976) suggested a revised\nchemotactic coefficient of the form\n\u03c7(s) = \u03c7Kd\n(Kd + s)2 , (5)\nwhere Kd is the receptor-ligand binding dissociation constant. They modeled the bacterial\nresponse to three steady-state attractant gradients; exponential, step and a step-like gra-\ndient defined by a Fermi function. By calculating the average number of bacteria which\nmove into the central region of the assay, Lapidus and Schiller (1976) were able to deter-\nmine values for the chemotactic coefficient, \u03c7 , and Kd . Model comparison with experi-\nment showed good agreement.\nIn Lapidus and Schiller (1978), the authors extended their earlier model to include\nbacterial growth. They compared numerically determined model solutions with Adler\u2019s\nexperimental results and those of Keller and Segel (1971b). The bacterial growth, while\ngenerally over a longer timescale than that of the experiment, was chosen to balance the\nloss of bacteria from the initial distribution due to the formation of bands. It was noted that\na lack of bacterial growth did not preclude the formation of bands, but cells were lost to\ndiffusion, resulting in a decrease in band speed and leading to a broadening of the bacterial\nprofile. Considering numerical solutions for different values of the chemotactic coefficient\nand the rate of attractant consumption, Lapidus and Schiller (1978) also showed that band\nformation is dependent upon these two parameters and obtained the limits in which these\nformed.\nUsing analytical methods, including traveling wave analysis, Green\u2019s functions and\nperturbation analysis, Rosen and colleagues analyzed a number of K\u2013S models, in which\nvariations in the form of the attractant degradation term were considered (Rosen, 1974,\n1975, 1976; Rosen and Baloga, 1975, 1976). Their motivation was to determine a K\u2013S\nmodel which admitted banded or solitary wave solutions which qualitatively agreed with\nthe work of Adler (1966) and gave unique mathematical solutions.\nIn Rosen (1974), it was noted that the case of f (b, s) = kbs with D = 0 means the K\u2013S\nmodel does not admit banded solitary wave solutions, and thus the authors considered\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n= \u2212kbsp, p \u2265 0. (6)\nThis form was found to admit solitary wave solutions for (1 \u2212 (\u03c7\/\u03bc)) < p < 1. Traveling\nwave analysis of the resultant governing equations allowed the speed of the bands to be\ndetermined. Rosen further justified this choice by noting that it may be associated with\npossible physio-chemical and biological mechanisms.\nKeller and Odell (1975) considered solutions to the K\u2013S model of Eqs. (1)\u2013(2) in\nwhich \u03bc(s), \u03c7(s) and f (b, s) are generalized unspecified functions. Using traveling wave\nanalysis, they obtained a set of conditions for which these functions admit traveling wave\nsolutions. In doing so, they verified the earlier finding of Keller and Segel (1971b) that\n\u03c7\/\u03bc > 1, but refuted that of Rosen that (1 \u2212 (\u03c7\/\u03bc)) < p < 1.\nIn works published in 1975 and 1976, Rosen (1975, 1976), Rosen and Baloga (1975,\n1976) focused on the model described by Eqs. (1) and (6) and its ability to admit stable\nchemotactic band forming solutions. Using a combination of Green function solutions to\n1580 Tindall et al.\nthe bacteria diffusing only problem and exact solutions to the chemotaxis only case, Rosen\n(1975) obtained approximate analytical solutions to the full system, noted as an alternative\nto the numerical solutions of Scribner et al. (1974). Rosen and Baloga (1975) considered\na transformation of \u03b8 = (s\/s\u221e)(1\u2212p) to combine Eqs. (1) and (2) into a single equation\nwhich exhibited solitary traveling wave solutions. Rosen (1976) focused on showing that\na K\u2013S model in which the chemoattractant degrades exponentially and does not diffuse\ngives traveling wave band solutions. He argued that banded solutions can not exist when\n\u03c7(s) = \u03c7\/(s +K)2 or \u03c7(s) = \u03c7(Ks + ln s)\/s and f (b, s) = kf bs or f (b, s) = kf bs\/(s +\nKs), by obtaining specific conditions on the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients and\nthe nutrient consumption function as s \u2192 0. Rosen and Baloga (1976) considered two-\ndimensional cylindrically symmetric propagating ring solutions to their model and ob-\ntained an asymptotic approximation to the bacterial density in the case of large radii.\nOdell and Keller (1976) considered solutions to the K\u2013S model for an extended do-\nmain and showed that traveling wave band solutions are possible for all \u03c7 > 0. They\nnoted the difference in the bacterial density distributions for \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c7\/\u03bc < 1\/2 and \u03b4 > 1\/2\nand showed that the bands and chemoattractant concentration become steeper as \u03b4 \u2192 0.\nThis counterintuitive finding is a result of the chemotactic coefficient being inversally pro-\nportional to the attractant gradient: an increase in the gradient leads to a decrease in \u03c7 .\nBands still form when \u03b4 is large and bounded, but the bacterial velocity must be of the or-\nder of the band velocity, indicating the attractant gradient has to be small. Odell and Keller\n(1976) further noted that the Keller and Segel (1971b) requirement \u03c7 > \u03bc for band forma-\ntion is still a necessary condition. However, of even greater importance is the chemotactic\nflux J = \u03c7b(\u2202s\/\u2202x)\/s at the trailing edge of the band, for given any \u03bc > 0, J can become\nsufficiently large at s = 0 to dominate bacterial diffusion, and thus allow bands to form.\nThe effects of cell death and growth on a K\u2013S model were considered by Kennedy\nand Aris (1980). Using traveling wave analysis on models both excluding and including\nchemotaxis (bacterial diffusion being assumed in either case), they showed that certain\ngrowth functions (see Appendix A) give traveling wave solutions of constant speed and\nthat the wave speed is increased when chemotaxis is included. This leads to an increase\nin the size of the population.\nLauffenburger et al. (1981) considered a reaction-diffusion model of a bacterial pop-\nulation whereby cells could only move by diffusion. The work included the effects of\nbacterial growth and death as well as uptake of the respective attractant substrate. The\nauthors analyzed the effect that each model parameter has on the steady-state form of the\npopulation and showed that the random motility of the population depended on the relative\nmagnitude of diffusion coefficient compared to the growth rate. The steady-state popula-\ntion size was found to decrease as the diffusion coefficient increased. Relative changes in\nthe diffusion coefficient were found to have a greater effect on the population size than\nrelative changes in the growth rate.\nLauffenburger et al. (1982) extended their work by including chemotaxis. They con-\nsidered the effect that varying ratios of diffusion versus chemotaxis have on the popu-\nlation density. As with their previous work, they showed that cell movement outweighs\ncell growth in terms of affecting the size and growth of the population. Motility effects\nbecome more important as the size of the confined growth region increases, but are di-\nminished when the nutrient does not diffuse.\nBoth works (Lauffenburger et al., 1981, 1982) show that diffusion alone is disadvan-\ntageous because it causes the dispersal of the bacteria from high regions of nutrient to\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1581\nlower regions. Chemotaxis is advantageous because it allows cells to move towards re-\ngions where the nutrient concentration is higher.\nFurther work (Lauffenburger et al., 1984) showed that a chemotactic term was not nec-\nessary in order to predict the formation of bands within a capillary assay. By including\nsimple descriptions of bacterial death and growth and assuming the bacteria moved sim-\nply by diffusion, Lauffenburger et al. (1984) showed that the governing system of equa-\ntions produced traveling wave solutions, a common feature of reaction\u2013diffusion systems\n(Murray, 1993). The speed of the bacterial band, size, and width of the bacterial popu-\nlation were all proportional to the square-root of the diffusion coefficient. The authors\nnoted their model results did not agree as well with experiments as those of previous K\u2013S\nmodels, which had included chemotaxis, and observed that these differences may not be\nobserved in vitro given the difference in timescales of bacterial death and growth in com-\nparison with the experiment. Thus, the K\u2013S description is appropriate for in vitro reported\nstudies, with the diffusion-only model possibly relevant on longer timescales observed\necologically.\nLauffenburger et al. (1984) extended their model to include chemotaxis with a receptor\nlaw coefficient of the form given by Eq. (5) and considered this or the reduced cases of\n\u03c7\/KD (a \t KD) and \u03c7\/a (a \u223c KD). The logarithmic law (\u03c7\/a) was most effective in\nincreasing the traveling band speed and population size and was \u2018superior\u2019 to the other\nchemotactic coefficient forms as it always assumes the receptors are acting at maximum\nsensitivity. A constant chemotactic coefficient was found to be ineffective in increasing\nthe band population with increasing attractant concentration and both the logarithmic and\nreceptor law coefficients are less sensitive to changes in the attractant concentration. Lauf-\nfenburger et al. (1984) hypothesized that chemotaxis allows a larger population to exist\nby moving a small number of bacteria into higher nutrient levels, followed by a larger\npopulation density. If the nutrient concentration increases, the bacterial population also\nincreases.\nNovick-Cohen and Segel (1984) later analyzed the original model of Keller and Segel\n(1971a) following the work of Scribner et al. (1974), Keller and Odell (1975) and Alt\n(1980) and focused on the issue of whether the chemotactic coefficient is required to be\nsingular in order to predict traveling wave solutions in the bacterial density profile. Their\ntraveling wave and asymptotic analysis resolves issues of \u03c7(s) needing to be singular\nand decreasing non-linearly to zero in order for the models to produce the experimentally\nobserved bands of migrating bacteria. The work also demonstrates that as the chemotactic\nband wave velocity decreases this leads to spreading or \u2018fanning\u2019 out at the back of the\nbacterial distribution.\nA transformation by Rosen (1983) of a K\u2013S model, in which the attractant is assumed\nto diffuse, showed that the resulting equation is the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Block equation. The lat-\nter does not include gradient terms of the variable being determined and has well-known\nsolutions given its use in quantum statistical mechanics. Initial value problems in bacter-\nial chemotaxis can thus be readily solved. It was noted that when \u03bc\/\u03c7 = 2, the effect of\nspatial variation in the attractant concentration was removed from the equation describ-\ning the evolution of the bacterial distribution. Removal of any gradient in the attractant,\nexcept implicitly implied through the Laplacian operator, shows the system of governing\nK\u2013S equations admits a high level of symmetry for this case.\nRivero-Hudec and Lauffenburger (1986) compared numerical and asymptotic solu-\ntions to a K\u2013S model where the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients were of the form\n1582 Tindall et al.\ngiven by Eq. (20) (see Section 3). Bacterial growth and death were ignored as were the\neffects of nutrient degradation. Transient and steady-state model simulations were com-\npared with the experimental results of Mesibov et al. (1973) and Adler and Dahl (1967),\nallowing values of the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients to be derived. The derived\nvalues agree well with those obtained by Berg and Brown (1972) although Rivero-Hudec\nand Lauffenburger (1986) note that their model does not account for attractant uptake.\nA model accounting for the effect of two chemoattractants (oxygen and glucose) on\nthe motility of E. coli within the capillary assay was formulated by Boon and Herpigny\n(1986). The work was motivated by the experimental results of Herpigny et al. (1984)\nwhich showed the formation of more complex, bistable time-dependent spatial patterns\nof bacteria when E. coli are grown in glucose where the surrounding medium is saturated\nin oxygen. Previous models had only included descriptions of the main chemoattractant\nand not oxygen. A K\u2013S model showed good agreement with experiment and considered\nthe effect of varying chemoattractant gradients: uniform and steep. The effect of oxygen\ndiffusion from the mouth of the capillary assay allowed the play-off between oxygen\ndiffusion and consumption to be evaluated. When the ratio of consumption to diffusion\nis large, bacteria accumulate near the mouth of the capillary. However, when diffusion\ndominates, i.e. when the ratio is small, bacteria still accumulate but not as strongly.\nThe work of Chen et al. (1998b) considered the effect that interactions between indi-\nvidual bacteria and the walls of the capillary assay have on the overall bacterial distri-\nbution. Their work was motivated by the experimental observations of Berg and Turner\n(1990) and Liu and Papadopoulos (1995) that the bacterial turn angle was related to the\ndiameter of the capillary. The authors considered the symmetrically reduced form of Alt\u2019s\nthree-dimensional model (Alt, 1980; Ford and Cummings, 1992) (see Section 3) and solu-\ntions from a gas kinetic model of chemotaxis. Their results show that the radius of the tube\naffects the form of the bacterial distribution; a radius of r \u000b 10 \u00b5m gives dimensionally\nreduced diffusion while r = \u000b6 \u00b5m results in wave-like motion. Chen et al. (1998b) noted\nthat the gas kinetic model does not give results which agree well with experiment, but by\nadapting this model to include the bacteria-wall interaction on turning and tumbling, the\nglobal turning probability density function is shown to be dependent upon the tube di-\nameter. By defining directional persistence, Chen et al. (1998b) note that a long waiting\ntime leads to a large diffusion coefficient, but when the waiting time is small, wave-like\nmotion is observed. Chen et al. (1998b) conclude that a constant ratio of diffusion coef-\nficients for varying tube diameter implies that: (i) geometrical constraints are universal\nand independent of receptor saturation by the attractant; and (ii) directional persistence\ndoes not increase with varying tumbling angles, but remains at its maximum value even\nwhen the diameter is small. The authors noted that their results agreed with experimental\nobservations that bacterial motion is guided by the walls of the tube and propose ways of\nexperimentally testing their theoretical predictions.\nMarx and Aitken (1999, 2000) and Pedit et al. (2002) have modeled the response of\nPseudomonas putida to napthalene. Their work was motivated by experimental results\n(Grimm and Harwood, 1997) showing this particular bacterial species responds chemo-\ntactically in the presence of napthalene. The authors noted, however, that chemotaxis had\nyet to be shown to be important in describing the bio-degradation of napathelene (or other\nsubstrates) in the natural environment. They hence set out to see what effect chemotaxis\nhas on attractant degradation.\nIn Marx and Aitken (1999), the authors considered the effect that variations in the bac-\nterial and attractant concentrations and incubation time had on the bacterial response. In\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1583\nparticular, they considered the effect that attractant diffusion at the mouth of the capillary\nassay has on bacterial aggregation as previously considered by Futrelle and Berg (1972)\nand Ford and Cummings (1992). They noted that while the model of Futrelle and Berg\n(1972) was more computationally intensive than that of Ford and Cummings (1992), the\nmodel does predict bacterial aggregation at the mouth of the capillary assay.\nMarx and Aitken (2000) considered the effect that attractant consumption has on the\nchemotactic response. They noted that earlier work by Rivero-Hudec and Lauffenburger\n(1986) and Ford and Cummings (1992) had neglected attractant consumption given the\nbacterial density was low. Using a K\u2013S model, with a chemotactic coefficient described\nby Eq. (27), Marx and Aitken (2000) showed that for a critical bacterial concentration,\nthe model solutions with and without consumption were identical. However, above this\nthreshold, the attractant becomes depleted thus reducing the later migration of bacteria,\nfollowing the initial first wave, into the capillary assay.\nPedit et al. (2002) extended the work of Marx and Aitken (2000) and noted that in-\ncreasing the dissociation constant Kd by an order of magnitude had a significant effect on\nthe rate of removal of napthalene. A four-fold increase had a modest effect on napthalene\nremoval. Overall, the model results agreed well with experiments with diffusion being\nshown to be insignificant for long time periods in the absence of attractant. By modifying\nAdler\u2019s original capillary assay method, Pedit et al. (2002) extended their model to study\nthe effects that porous media have on bacterial migration. They showed that porous media\nlead to lower accumulation of bacteria in the capillary, but chemotaxis still occurs in such\nsystems.\nHilpert (2005) has considered two-dimensional numerical solutions, using the Lattice\u2013\nBoltzmann (LB) numerical method, to a model of bacterial chemotaxis similar to that of\nKeller and Segel (1971a). The LB method uses quasi-particles to represent individual\ncells moving across a grid. The model uses the chemotactic velocity description derived\nby Ford and Cummings (1992) and attractant consumption is based on Monod kinetics.\nThe model can reproduce the chemotactic bands considered by Keller and Segel (1971b)\nin the case of the bacteria Pseudomonas putida and shows changes in the bacterial density\nof the bands due to loss of bacteria. This result is in contrast to that of Keller and Segel\n(1971b) which showed constant bacterial density for each band. Hilpert (2005) notes that\nby assuming the bacterial band is in a quasi-steady state, the original results of Keller and\nSegel (1971b) can be obtained. Further analysis shows that changes in the initial length\nof the bacterial population within the capillary does not affect the width of the resultant\nbacterial bands. The band velocities are also not greatly affected. The article discusses\nboth the advantages and disadvantages of using the Lattice\u2013Boltzmann method in solving\nbacterial population models.\n2.3. Further continuum models of bacterial chemotaxis\nThe effects of local and non-local cell growth on the dynamics of a well-packed sym-\nmetrical bacterial population in an inoculum have been studied by Grimson and Barker\n(1994). The authors analyze a single reaction\u2013diffusion equation describing the bacterial\ncell density which includes both diffusion and growth terms. The growth term consists\nof a local growth term, dependent on the bacterial cell density, plus a non-local term\nmodeled as the gradient of the cell density squared. Grimson and Barker (1994) argue\nthat such a term represents non-local growth given that packing suppresses local growth\n1584 Tindall et al.\nand re-organization and growth of the population will generally occur on the periphery\nof the colony where the concentration of growth medium is greatest. While they do not\ncite any direct experimental motivation for their work, they note that such a model would\nnot account for bacterial growth and movement \u201con the surface of a growth medium\u201d.\nThey show that the governing equation can be written as a Fisher-type equation, and thus\nexhibits traveling wave solutions. The importance of the relative strength of local versus\nnon-local growth is considered. Analysis shows that when the growth rate of the popu-\nlation is positive, the population front moves at a non-constant velocity as a result of the\nnon-local population term.\nWidman et al. (1997) and Chiu and Hoppensteadt (2001) have modeled the bacterial\nresponse to varying forms of attractant gradients generated using the diffusion gradient\nchamber (DGC) assay as described by Emerson et al. (1994). Widman et al. (1997) un-\ndertook their own experiments on E. coli and sought to determine values for the diffusion\nand chemotactic coefficients. These values were then used to parameterize a K\u2013S model,\nwhere 2-D numerical simulations were compared with photographic data showing the\nspatial variation in time of the bacterial distributions within the DGC assay. The model\nand experimental results agreed well thus verifying the respective parameter values. In\nformulating their model, Widman et al. (1997) included a description of the two chemoat-\ntractants: aspartate and oxygen. The inclusion of oxygen led to results which gave better\nmodel fits to the experimental data. The model correctly reproduced the observed dynam-\nical wave of bacteria which moves through the system, but which slows in regions of\nhigh attractant concentration. Widman et al. (1997) noted that the observed flattening of\ncircular patterns of bacterial distributions could be explained as either a result of receptor\nsaturation or cells taking longer to consume higher concentrations of chemoattractant near\ntheir source. Chiu and Hoppensteadt (2001) also found that a second attractant (oxygen)\nwas required in order for model predictions to match the experimental outcomes. Using a\nsimilar model to that of Widman et al. (1997), the authors focused on the effect that nutri-\nent consumption rate and the initial nutrient concentration had on the bacterial response.\nThe model predicted that a large initial nutrient concentration would lead to wider pat-\nterns of bacterial aggregation and slower cell movement, results which were confirmed by\nexperiment.\nMazzag et al. (2003) have formulated a model describing the aerotactic response of\nAzospirillum brasilense to varying concentrations of oxygen in a capillary assay. The au-\nthors describe the bacterial density along the length of the tube using the one-dimensional\ntelegraph equations (see Section 3). Motivated by the experimental work of Zhulin et al.\n(1996), they assume cells have a low internal energy when the external oxygen concen-\ntration is very low or very high, but the internal energy is maximized and constant at rel-\natively normal oxygen concentrations. An energy function capturing these three states is\nincorporated into the equations describing the bacterial densities and Mazzag et al. (2003)\nshow that the results from their model agree well with experimental findings reported in\nZhulin et al. (1996). They justify their internal energy description by showing that a plot\nof the energy function versus oxygen concentration compares qualitatively well with a\nmodel of phosphorylated CheY regulation in an E. coli cell in the absence and presence\nof oxygen, thus supporting the energy function description in producing the observed\nmotor biasing in the presence of oxygen.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1585\nFig. 5 The bacterial transitions considered by Segel in his 1976 model incorporating receptor dynamics\nin a population model of bacterial chemotaxis. Here, E represents an open enzyme ligand free receptor,\nC an open enzyme ligand bound receptor, D an enzyme \u2018bent\u2019 ligand free receptor, F an enzyme bent\nligand bound receptor, s is the attractant concentration, and each ki (i = \u00b11, . . . ,\u00b14) represents the rate\nof transfer between each state. Adapted from Segel (1976).\n3. Microscopic to macroscopic modeling\nA growing number of approaches have been taken in modeling and understanding the\neffect that microscopic (individual) behavior has on the macroscale (population) level.\nHere, we review approaches which have sought to incorporate \u2018multiscale\u2019 modeling.\nSegel (1976) incorporated details of the receptor dynamics into a population model\nof chemotaxis. By considering the receptors to exist in either an open or \u2018bent\u2019 confor-\nmation, he considered a four state model which included the effects of ligand binding as\ndemonstrated in Fig. 5. The total bacterial receptor population was considered to exist in\neither one of these four states. Considering a one-dimensional region of length L, bacteria\nwhich responded positively to the attractant moved in the positive x-direction while neg-\natively responding bacteria moved in the negative x-direction. In the case where spatial\nvariation in the attractant gradient is assumed to be small, he showed that the governing\nsystem of equations reduced to the K\u2013S model (Keller and Segel, 1971a).\nSegel (1977) extended this earlier work and noted that a much better model fit to\nexperimental data could be obtained when the turning probabilities of the bacteria were\nassumed to depend on the temporal rate of change of chemoreceptor occupancy, a result\nnot dissimilar to that noted by Block et al. (1983). Segel (1977) used a simplified form of\nhis earlier model in which each receptor could exist in only a ligand bound or unbound\n1586 Tindall et al.\nstate\n\u2202E+\n\u2202t\n+ u\u2202E\n+\n\u2202x\n= k\u22121C+ \u2212 k1sE+ + \u03c3\u2212E\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3+E+, (7)\n\u2202C+\n\u2202t\n+ u\u2202C\n+\n\u2202x\n= \u2212k\u22121C+ + k1sE+ + \u03c3\u2212C\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3+C+, (8)\n\u2202E\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2212 u\u2202E\n\u2212\n\u2202x\n= k\u22121C\u2212 \u2212 k1sE\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212E\u2212 + \u03c3+E+, (9)\n\u2202C\u2212\n\u2202t\n+ u\u2202C\n\u2212\n\u2202x\n= \u2212k\u22121C\u2212 + k1sE\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212C\u2212 + \u03c3+C+, (10)\nwhere E+ (E\u2212) represents the number density of unbound receptors on right (left) moving\nbacteria and C+ (C\u2212) represents the number density of receptor-ligand bound receptors\non right (left) moving bacteria, u is the bacterial velocity, k1, k\u22121, \u03c3\u2212, and \u03c3+ represent\nthe rate of transfer between each state, and s is the concentration of attractant described\nby\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n= \u2212k1s\n(\nE+ + E\u2212) + k\u22121\n(\nC+ + C\u2212) \u2212 d + D \u2202\n2s\n\u2202x2\n, (11)\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient of the attractant and d represents constant degradation\nor consumption.\nSegel\u2019s work also showed that by relating his results to the K\u2013S model the diffusion\nand chemotactic coefficients could be written in terms of microscopic variables\n\u03bc = u\n2\n2\u03c3\nand \u03c7(s) = u\n2\n2\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\u2212\n\u2202x\nd\nds\n(\ns\nK + s\n)\n.

The turning rates k are assumed here to be constant. This hyperbolic system of equa-\ntions is often referred to as the telegraph system of equations because they can be written\nas the single second order partial differential telegraph equation (Othmer et al., 1988;\nOckendon et al., 1999)\n\u22022\u03c6\n\u2202t2\n+ 2k \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n= u2 \u2202\n2\u03c6\n\u2202x2\n, (15)\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1587\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2212. This model system and the resulting telegraph equation have been\nanalyzed by a number of authors both within the context of bacterial chemotaxis and\nchemotactic theory in general (Othmer et al., 1988; Hillen and Othmer, 2000). Othmer\net al. (1988) derived the governing equations whereby a Poisson process governs the dis-\ncontinuous changes in speed and direction of the bacterium (a velocity jump process).\nThey showed that the governing equations reduced to the telegraph equation when the\nspeed of the bacterium is constant and the spatial flux in cell numbers is the difference\nin right and left moving cells. Furthermore, the bacteria are assumed to change direction\neach time they are allowed to do so. Hillen and Othmer (2000) formally showed that the\ntelegraph equation reduces to the diffusion equation for various asymptotic limits, for\ninstance when the turning rate \u03bb and u simultaneously tend to infinity the diffusion coef-\nficient is defined by D = u2\/\u03bb. Their work also discussed the conditions for an isotropic\ndiffusion tensor and the effect that various external forms of cell motion have on the de-\nrived asymptotic equations.\nThe work of Rosen (1973) considered the connection between descriptions of bacterial\nchemotaxis using the Fokker\u2013Planck and Langevin equations and K\u2013S models. It was\nnoted that the Langevin description is appropriate for low Reynolds number (Stoke\u2019s flow)\nover short timescales so long as the bacterial propulsive force takes a particular form. In\ncontrast, the Fokker\u2013Planck description is appropriate for macroscopic timescales on the\norder of the timescale over which the bacterial population evolves. Rosen noted that the\nbacterial density is given by\nb(x, t) =\n\u222b\n\u03a3\nP (x,y; t)b0(y) d3y, (16)\nwhere b0(y) is the initial bacterial distribution and P (x,y; t) is the probability density\nfunction for a bacterium initially at y, to be at spatial point x, at time t, and is governed\nby a Fokker\u2013Planck equation of the form\n\u2202P\n\u2202t\n= \u03bc\u22072P \u2212 \u03c7\u2207 \u00b7 (P\u2207 ln s) (17)\nwith the initial condition limt\u21920+ P (x,y; t) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y). Here \u03bc is a diffusion coefficient\nand \u03c7 a chemotactic coefficient. Rosen notes that certain forms of the Fokker\u2013Planck\nequation can be transformed into the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Block equation, and this is useful in\nproviding known solutions to specific initial value problems in bacterial chemotaxis as\ndetailed further in his later work (Rosen, 1983) as discussed in Section 2.2.\nLovely and Dahlquist (1975) formulated a three-dimensional model of microscopic\nbehavior of bacteria. Using statistical methods to link experimentally observed parame-\nters to their five defined measures of bacterial motility as shown in Table 1, they derived\nexpressions for: (i) a direction correlation function; (ii) a diffusion constant; (iii) a persis-\ntence time; (iv) an average velocity; and (v) an up\/down movement ratio in terms of indi-\nvidual cell parameters. In deriving the respective expressions, they assumed that bacterial\npaths are composed of straight lines, cell trajectories have constant speed, bacteria turn\nsuch that their new direction is asymmetric\/symmetric about the initial direction, and the\nangles between and derivation of successive trajectories are governed by probability dis-\ntributions which are independent of any other information, such as previous trajectories.\nThe probability distribution of each trajectory was assumed to be a decaying exponential\ndistribution.\n1588 Tindall et al.\nTable 1 Macroscopic parameters derived in terms of individual microscopic variables (Lovely and\nDahlquist, 1975). Here, T is the mean trajectory duration, T (u) is the direction dependent mean trajectory\nduration, v is the speed of the bacterium, \u03c6 is the mean turn angle, \u03b1 is the mean cosine of the turn angle,\nand F(x) is an expression describing the dependence of T on the attractant concentration and its temporal\nderivative\nCorrelation time \u03c4 = T1\u2212\u03b1 Diffusion coefficient D = v\n2T\n3(1\u2212\u03b1) = 13 v2\u03c4\nPersistence time t = \u03c0\n\u03c6\n\u222b 1\n0 T (u)du Average velocity V = v\n\u222b 1\u22121 uT (u)du\u222b 1\u22121 T (u)du\n= v\u03b3\n\u222b \u03b3\n\u2212\u03b3 xF (x)dx\u222b \u03b3\n\u2212\u03b3 F (x)dx\n= \u03c0\u03b3\u03c6\n\u222b \u03b3\n0 F(x)dx\nUp\/down ratio R =\n\u222b 1\n0 uT (u)du\u222b \u22121\n0 uT (u)du\n=\n\u222b \u03b3\n0 xF (x)dx\u222b \u2212\u03b3\n0 xF (x)dx\nThe derivation of a stochastic description, incorporating individual cell behavior, was\nthe focus of work by Alt (1980). By considering a bacterial density distribution \u03c3 =\n\u03c3(t,x, \u03b8, \u03c4 ), which moved through an angle \u03b8 when changing direction and with run\ntime \u03c4 , he derived the governing stochastic equation\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c4\n+ \u03b8 \u00b7 \u2207(c\u03c3 ) = \u2212\u03b2\u03c3, \u03c4 > 0, (18)\nwhere c = c(x, t) is the mean speed of a run and \u03b2 = \u03b2(x, t, \u03b8, \u03c4 ) is the turning or tum-\nbling frequency distribution, with \u03c3 defined for a new run in a new direction \u03b7 by\n\u03c3(x, t, \u03b7,0) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u222b\nS\n(\u03b2\u03c3)k d\u03b8 d\u03c4, (19)\nwhere \u03b7 is the angle through which the bacteria have turned (derived from a turn angle\ndistribution k = k(x, t, \u03b8;\u03b7)) and S is the unit sphere in n-dimensional space. When \u03b2 is\nindependent of the turn angle, the equations reduce to an integral equation which in one\ndimension reduces to the model of Keller and Segel (1971b). In the presence of a chemoat-\ntractant, \u03b2 is assumed to be of the form \u03b2(t, x, \u03b8) = \u03b20(s(t, x), s(t \u2212T ,x \u2212T c\u03b8)), where\n\u03b20 is the initial turning frequency and T is the \u2018memory time\u2019 of the bacterium. The\nmain objective of the work is to then derive a diffusion equation approximation, from the\ngoverning equations, which is valid in n dimensions.\nAlt undertook asymptotic analysis of the governing equations to consider small limits\nof certain parameters affecting run lengths and turn angles of the bacteria. He showed that\nin the case of K\u2013S continuum models the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients can be\nrelated to microscopic parameters by\n\u03bc = 1\n2\nT v2 and \u03c7(s) = KdT v\n2\u03c3\n(Kd + s)2 =\n\u03b30Kd\n(Kd + s)2 , (20)\nwhere v is the mean speed of the bacterium, Kd is the receptor-attractant dissociation\nconstant, and \u03c3 is the decrease in the change of the mean direction for a specific level of\nreceptor binding. Various estimates of T and v were made by Berg and Brown (1972) for\nE. coli. As noted by Chen et al. (1998a), Alt\u2019s three-dimensional model, while compre-\nhensive, is difficult to solve analytically and has for this reason, not received as wide a\ndegree of attention as have the generalized K\u2013S models.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1589\nThe model of Rivero et al. (1989), more commonly referred to as the RTBL model,\nlinks a macroscopic bacterial description by the telegraph process to the individual mi-\ncroscopic variables of cell speed, persistence time and temporal receptor occupation. By\nfirst noting the observations of Berg and Brown (1972) that attractant presence stimulates\ndirectional change in turning probabilities, and motivated by the work of Segel (1977),\nPatlak (1953) and Alt (1980), Rivero et al. (1989) note that the tumbling probabilities can\nbe written as\np\n+\/\u2212\nt = p0 exp\n(\n\u2212\u03c3 DNb\nDt\n)\n, (21)\nwhere \u03c3 is the chemotactic sensitivity (the change in the mean run time of a bacterium per\nrate of change of bound receptors) and DNb\/Dt is the material derivative of the number of\nbound receptors Nb . The authors show that expressions for the diffusion and chemotactic\ncoefficients of the form\n\u03bc(s) = 2v\np0(1 \u2212 \u03c8) exp\n(\n\u03c3\ndNb\nds\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n)\nsech\n(\n\u03c3x\ndNb\nds\n\u2202s\n\u2202x\n)\n(22)\nand\n\u03c7(s) = v tanh\n(\n\u03c3v\ndNb\nds\n\u2202s\n\u2202x\n)\n, (23)\nwhere in the case of a single receptor it is assumed that\ndNb\nds\n= RT Kd\n(Kd + s)2 , (24)\ncan be derived. Here, \u03c8 is the cosine of the persistence angle, p0 is the individual bacterial\ntumbling probability in the absence of a chemoattractant gradient, RT is the number of\nreceptors per cell, and Kd is the receptor-attractant dissociation constant. Various limits\nof the expressions are considered and it is noted that in the case of shallow attractant\ngradients, as analyzed by Keller and Segel (1971a), these expressions reduce to\n\u03bc(s) = v\n2\np0(1 \u2212 \u03c8)\n(\n1 + \u03c3 dNb\nds\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n)\nand \u03c7(s) = \u03c7v2\u03c3 dNb\nds\n. (25)\nComparison of model solutions using the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients given by\nEqs. (22) and (23) with experimental work (Dahlquist et al., 1976; Mesibov et al., 1973;\nBerg and Brown, 1972) shows good agreement between the two.\nFord et al. (1991) compared the RTBL model, with non-linear terms for the chemotac-\ntic and diffusion coefficients of the form given in Eqs. (22) and (23), with results obtained\nfrom SFDC experiments. The model neglects the effects of consumption of the chemoat-\ntractant by the bacteria. They noted that the steep attractant gradients which develop in\nthe SFDC assay can not be adequately described by the K\u2013S model, given the assumption\nby K\u2013S during the derivation of their model that the attractant gradient is small (Keller\nand Segel, 1971a). They compared model outcomes for the three cases of: (i) constant\ndiffusion and a linear description of chemotaxis; (ii) constant diffusion and the non-linear\n1590 Tindall et al.\ndescription of chemotaxis given by Eq. (23); and (iii) non-linear diffusion and chemotaxis\nas described by Eqs. (22) and (23). Results showed that while all three forms of the diffu-\nsion and chemotactic coefficients converge to the same steady-state cell distributions, the\nintermediate behavior differs substantially. The case of constant diffusion and non-linear\nchemotaxis provided the best fit to experimental data indicating the limitations of linear\nmodels.\nFord and Lauffenburger continued their work on using the RTBL model to reproduce\nexperimental findings in Ford and Lauffenburger (1991a). Here, the focus was the find-\nings of Dahlquist et al. (1972) (see Section 2.2 for earlier models and details) where steep\nand smooth attractant gradients were considered. Ford and Lauffenburger (1991a) quali-\ntatively assessed the effect that varying diffusion and chemotactic motility parameters had\non the shape of the attractant and bacterial profiles. On fitting the model to the experimen-\ntal findings of Dahlquist et al., they found that by including expressions for two receptors\nwith different affinities, as part of the chemotactic coefficient, they were able to account\nfor the difference in cell velocities across a range of attractant concentrations.\nFord and Cummings (1992) compared each of the models of Alt (1980), Segel (1977)\nand Rivero et al. (1989) and considered the various relationships between each model.\nThey noted that Alt\u2019s three-dimensional model can be reduced to one dimension when the\nattractant gradient is assumed to vary in only one spatial dimension and the run times are\ndistributed according to a Poisson distribution. These assumptions lead to the equation\n\u2202n(x, \u03b8, t)\n\u2202t\n= \u2212sx \u2202(v(x, t)n(x, \u03b8, t))\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u03b2(x, \u03b8, t)n(x, \u03b8, t)\n+\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\n\u03b2(x, \u03b8 \u2032, t)n(x, \u03b8 \u2032, t)K(\u03b8 \u2032, \u03b8) sin \u03b8 \u2032 d\u03b8 \u2032, (26)\nwhere n(x, \u03b8, t) is the distribution of cells moving at an angle \u03b8 and K(\u03b8 \u2032, \u03b8) is the turn\nangle distribution (the probability that a particle moving in the \u03b8 \u2032 direction will tumble\nto then move in the \u03b8 direction). This one-dimensional model reduces to a generic K\u2013S\nmodel when the attractant gradient is only considered to vary in one spatial dimension.\nFord and Cummings (1992) further noted that Alt\u2019s model reduces to Stroock\u2019s probabilis-\ntic density equation (Stroock, 1974) when bacterial tumbling is assumed to be indepen-\ndent of the run time. They further showed that the governing equations of the RTBL model\ncould be derived from Alt\u2019s full three-dimensional model and that the one-dimensional\nswimming speed is one half the corresponding speed in three-dimensions.\nFrymier et al. (1993) discussed the validity of the RTBL model in describing experi-\nments in which the attractant gradient is experimentally three-dimensional, but where the\nRTBL model has assumed it is one-dimensional. Frymier et al. (1993) compared numeri-\ncal simulations of the RTBL model with discrete three-dimensional Monte Carlo simula-\ntions of Alt\u2019s equations. They found that the RTBL assumption that the attractant gradient\nonly varies in one dimension did not make an appreciable difference to solutions. It was\nnoted that it is important to obey the relationship between the one- and three-dimensional\nchemotactic coefficients of \u03c73D0 = 4\u03c71D0 as derived by Ford and Cummings (1992).\nThe work of Frymier and co-workers (Frymier et al., 1994) has compared finite el-\nement solutions of the reduced one-dimensional attractant gradient model of Alt (Ford\nand Cummings, 1992) with model solutions of Frymier et al. (1993) and the author\u2019s own\nexperimental data on the chemotaxis of E. coli using the SFDC assay. Results from both\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1591\nmodels were shown to be in good agreement with experiment. In considering the two cases\nof bacteria returning to their original tumbling frequency or having an increased rate of\ntumbling when moving away from attractant gradient, Frymier et al. (1994) showed the\nformer assumption results in fewer bacteria moving to areas of higher concentration. It\nwas further noted that discrepancies in predicted values of the chemotactic coefficient oc-\ncur when \u03c7 is predicted using the one-dimensional attractant case of Ford and Cummings\n(1992) rather than the three-dimensional, full RTBL, model assumption.\nBrosilow et al. (1996) compared one- and two-dimensional numerical solutions of the\nmodels of Alt (1980) (in the case where the bacterial running speed is assumed constant)\nand the RTBL model (Rivero et al., 1989). Solutions from each model were compared\nwith the SFDC experimental observations of Ford and Lauffenburger (1991b) and showed\nthat the discretized Alt model gives similar solutions to a slightly modified version of the\nRTBL model (the bacterial velocity is assumed to be half that stated in Rivero et al.,\n1989). Such agreement even occurred when the turning angle was coarsely discretized.\nThus, while the Alt model provides a detailed model of chemotactic aggregation and\nmovement, the RTBL model gives an adequate continuum based description of bacterial\nchemotaxis.\nBrosilow et al. do note that although Alt\u2019s model is comprehensive, it does not nec-\nessarily account for four important features of bacterial chemotaxis. Firstly, the model\nassumes bacterial runs are straight paths, when in fact they have been observed to drift\nrotationally. Indeed this difference can be as great as \u03b8 \u223c \u221at\/2, where \u03b8 is the drift an-\ngle and t is the run time in seconds. Thus, the model may overestimate the chemotac-\ntic response of the cell. Secondly, tumbles are instantaneous and short in comparison to\nruns. This assumption may somewhat overestimate the bacterial speed of response to any\nchanges in attractant concentration. Thirdly, Alt (1980) assumes that the speed of the bac-\nterial runs is constant when in fact such runs are distributed with a variance of up to 25%\nfrom the mean running speed. Finally, the bacterial tumbling process is assumed to obey a\nPoisson distribution, when as Brosilow et al. note, bacterial tumbling does vary from one\nbacterium to another. The work furthermore shows that bacterial persistence decreases\nthe rate at which bacteria move towards an attractant. In the case of the RTBL model,\npersistent random walk behavior leads to a large diffusion coefficient in comparison to\nwhen movement is not persistent. This persistence does not affect the chemotactic term\nof the RTBL model.\nChen et al. (1998c) undertook extensive perturbation analysis of Alt\u2019s governing equa-\ntions and derived a similar expression for the chemotactic coefficient to that of Rivero\net al. (1989) (see Eq. (23))\n\u03c7(s) = 2v\n3\ntanh\n(\n\u03c70\n2v\nKd\n(Kd + s)2\n\u2202s\n\u2202x\n)\n. (27)\nThis expression has since been used in a number of macroscale continuum models of bac-\nterial chemotaxis (Marx and Aitken, 1999, 2000; Pedit et al., 2002; Hilpert, 2005) (see\nSection 2.2 for further details), its use motivated by the fact that it allows the effect of im-\nportant microscopic effects, which affect chemotaxis, to be evaluated on the macroscale,\nas noted by Ford et al. (1991). For instance, Pedit et al. (2002) noted that in obtaining good\nagreement between experimental data and model output for the response of Pseudomonas\nputida to naphthaelene, the velocity expression of Eq. (27), and thus the overall macro-\nscopic description of the bacterial density, is particularly sensitive to changes in Kd .\n1592 Tindall et al.\nChen and co-workers (Chen et al., 1998a, 1999) have reduced Alt\u2019s three-dimensional\nmodel to one dimension, analyzed the resulting equation and it\u2019s relation to Segel\u2019s work\n(Segel, 1976, 1977), and the effect of tumbling frequencies. Chen et al. (1998a) consid-\nered the effect that individual bacterial turning frequencies have on the overall global\npopulation turning frequency, noting the latter is more commonly determined in experi-\nments. Moment analysis of the turning probability distribution function showed that the\nhigher order moments are useful in searching for appropriate angle distributions which\nare perturbed by the chemoattractant. In Chen et al. (1999), the authors considered a\none-dimensional reduction of Alt\u2019s model equations and assumed the tumbling frequency\nswitched between different phases dependent upon the strength of the attractant gradi-\nent. Their motivation was the observations of Macnab and Koshland (1972) and Berg and\nBrown (1972) that bacteria only adjust their tumbling frequency slightly when moving\ndown an attractant\/repellent gradient versus when moving up an attractant gradient, and\nthe tumbling time is exponentially distributed. It was noted that the bacterial turning angle\nrange was limited when both temporal and spatial gradients of the chemoattractant were\nconsidered and that this defines the overall chemotactic response. Undertaking perturba-\ntion analysis of the governing equations in the limit of a small attractant gradient, Chen\net al. (1999) showed the resultant solutions agreed well with numerical solutions of the\nfull Alt model.\nThe reduction of Alt\u2019s model, in the case of a one-dimensional attractant gradient with\na bi-phasic angular distribution function, has been the focus of work by Chen et al. (2003).\nThe authors investigated the effects of assuming planar geometry and showed that the first\norder angular moment of the turn angle probability distribution function is important in\naffecting the bacterial response. In converting the angular number density to a bacterial\nbulk density by integrating the former over the turning angles, the resultant equation can\nbe related to the diffusion equation. The diffusion and chemotactic coefficients in one\ndimension are found to be three times larger than those in three dimensions if the indi-\nvidual cell swimming speed in one- and three-dimensions remains the same. Perturbation\nsolutions to the reduced model compare well with numerical solutions to Alt\u2019s full model\nequations, both of which compare well with results from SFDC experiments.\nSchnitzer et al. (1990) considered the effect that the microscale movement of cells has\non the overall macroscale behavior, specifically diffusion. They considered a bacterium\nmoving a distance \u03b4 in a time \u03c4 and the effect that varying both the distance and speed\nindependently and together has on the derived macroscopic equations. They noted that:\n(i) varying \u03b4 and \u03c4 , whilst maintaining a constant speed, leads to a spatially varying dif-\nfusion coefficient, but a uniform steady-state bacterial distribution; (ii) keeping \u03b4 constant\nwhilst varying \u03c4 means D = \u03b42\/4\u03c4(x), the steady-state bacterial distribution is inversely\nproportional to D and the cells accumulate when the time taken to travel a set distance\nincreases. Here, x is the spatial location of the cell; (iii) varying \u03b4 and keeping \u03c4 constant\ngives D = \u03b42(x)\/4\u03c4 and leads to an equilibrium distribution where the bacterial density is\ninversely proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient; and (iv) varying \u03b4 and\n\u03c4 shows the resultant flux equation can not be written in terms of a diffusion coefficient.\nThe authors note that case (ii) corresponds to the classic K\u2013S model. From Monte Carlo\nsimulations on lattices of varying sizes, Schnitzer et al. (1990) conclude that when the\nbacterial turning frequency depends solely on the local attractant gradient with a constant\ncell speed, cells do not accumulate at the crest of the gradient. If the initial bacterial distri-\nbution is uniform, it will remain so. Furthermore, when the cell speed depends on the local\nattractant concentration, bacteria will still aggregate, even when the cell speed is low.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1593\nSchnitzer (1993) continued to elucidate the link between microscale behavior and\nmacroscale models of bacterial movement. He argued that bacterial random walks can\nnot be treated on a lattice given the infinite number of distinct directions of motion and\nthe Langevin description is not appropriate as it does not consider individual microscopic\ncollisions. Extending earlier work (Schnitzer et al., 1990) on turning rates and travel time\nand including analysis of turning angles, he derives the Smoluchowski state equation in\nthe context of bacterial movement based on the assumption that the probability distribu-\ntion of correlations between directions of motion and after collisions are smooth.\nRecently, two further pieces of work (de Gennes, 2004; Clark and Grant, 2005) have\nconsidered the effect that internal delays within the intracellular signaling cascade have\non the bacterial response. de Gennes (2004) considered the motion of a single bacterium\nduring one run, i.e. a counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation of its flagella, and related the\nresponse function (the receptor to motor response) describing the bacterium to the macro-\nscopic scale chemotactic coefficient. de Gennes disagrees with the findings of Schnitzer\net al. (1990) that the chemotactic coefficient is zero when the bacterial response is instan-\ntaneous. Instead, he notes that by accounting for the internal receptor to motor response\ndelay, the chemotactic coefficient is a sum of the response function, which decreases as\nthe internal delay increases.\nClark and Grant (2005) adopted the model of de Gennes and considered the importance\nof the response function in describing the difference in short and long bacterial runs. A\npositive response to short runs should move bacteria up attractant gradients, while long\nruns should allow bacteria to aggregate in the regions where the attractant concentration\nis greatest. However, Clark and Grant (2005) find that optimizing one response leads to\nan unfavorable response in the other. They show that experimental evidence is most likely\nto be reproduced when a combination of each response is considered (the commonly\nobserved excitation\u2013adaptation response curve), and thus obtain an appropriate expression\nfor the response function.\nD\u2019Orsogna et al. (2003) considered the influence of chemokinesis and chemotaxis\non the aggregation of Myxococcus xanthus. Considering a single bacterium, a one-\ndimensional model was derived, based on turning probabilities, which accounted for the\nbacteria releasing and sensing their own attractant. The probability of direction reversal\nwas considered to be a function of the absolute level of chemoattractant under each cell\nand the gradient sensed along the length of the cell. D\u2019Orsogna et al. (2003) derived a\nFokker\u2013Planck equation to describe the bacterial movement of a population and under-\ntook Monte Carlo simulations of the resultant model. They considered the effect that both\nchemo-attractants and -repellents have on the turning rates when both chemotaxis and\nchemokinesis are individually included in the model description as well as together. It\nwas shown that various distributions form dependent on the strength of each mechanism.\nAgent based models of bacterial chemotaxis have been developed by Kreft et al.\n(1998), Emonet et al. (2005), and Bray et al. (2007). Such models allow attributes of\nindividual cell behavior to be measured on the population scale and are computational in\nnature; each cell has a set of defined rules which it follows. Although Kreft et al. (1998)\nand Emonet et al. (2005) used a similar modeling methodology, their approaches contrast\nin a number of ways. The simulator developed by Kreft et al. (1998) (BacSim) focused\non the cellular metabolism and the effect that cell size and division have on the popu-\nlation. On the single scale, their model accounted for substrate uptake, metabolism, the\nmaintenance of cell biomass, cell volume and surface area, cell diffusion, and the growth\n1594 Tindall et al.\nof the colony. In contrast, the simulator developed by Emonet et al. (2005) (AgentCell)\nincluded a description of receptor dynamics, the intracellular phosphotransfer network,\nand the motor and flagellum response.\nKreft et al. (1998) note that random variation in the maximum size of the cell causes\nthe population to become more asynchronous than random variation in cell size at divi-\nsion. The most asynchronous population is obtained when both maximum and division\nsize are chosen to vary randomly. They note that spatial heterogeneity in the available\nnutrient concentration does not generally cause asynchrony in the population, but results\nin sub-populations of the main population which grow at different rates, thus giving the\nappearance of asynchrony. Emonet et al. (2005) considered the effect that stochastic vari-\nation in the intracellular signaling pathway may have on the population scale, their work\nmotivated by the experimental evidence of Korobkova et al. (2004). The phosphoryla-\ntion signal pathway is implemented using the stochastic molecular simulator StochSim\n(Morton-Firth et al., 1999). AgentCell was used to undertake two simulations. The first\nconsidered a population of 1,166 cells swimming in a three-dimensional environment,\nwhile the second looked at an individually tethered cell. The single cell behavior com-\npared well with that observed by Korobkova et al. (2004) and details on the diffusion\nrate of the population compared well with the experimentally known values of Lewus\nand Ford (2001) and Berg and Turner (1993). Whilst both models have sought to deter-\nmine the effect that single cell behavior has on the population scale, both models have\nnot systematically studied the effect that individual cell characteristics, such as recep-\ntor sensitivity, excitation, adaptation, motor response, and variations in them have on the\npopulation scale.\nThe work of Bray et al. (2007) considers the movement of bacteria in two-dimensional\nattractant gradients and includes a revised version of their earlier subcellular phosphory-\nlation pathway (incorporating CheR, CheBP , CheA, CheAP , CheY, CheYP , and CheZ)\nmodels (Bray et al., 1993; Bray and Bourret, 1995). The individual cell models include\nonly a description of the Tar receptor and the physics of flagella motion are ignored. The\nauthors have developed two graphical representations of the bacterial populations. The\nE. solo model describes individual bacteria in uniform concentration gradients of aspar-\ntate, with each cell depicting up to four flagella. The program allows the attractant concen-\ntration to be adjusted during the course of a simulation and measurements of the tumbling\nfrequency, adaptation time, turn angle (when tumbling) to be analysed. The E. pluribus\nmodel allows the movement of bacteria (without flagella) of either wild or mutant types,\nwithin a pre-defined fixed attractant gradient, to be analyzed.\nBray et al. (2007) use E. pluribus to examine the effect that adaptation and the sen-\nsitivity of the phosphorylation network to attractant binding (they define an \u201cinfectivity\nfactor\u201d) has on bacterial aggregation. Considering various exponential radially static gra-\ndients of attractants, they show that the simulated bacteria only accumulate at the maximal\nof high attractant concentrations when the activity of CheR and CheB are increased 15-\nfold. At normally predicted activity levels of CheR and CheB (from in vitro studies), the\ncell overshoot in adaptation response is almost non-existent, thus they do not accumulate\nin regions of high attractant concentration. Bray et al. (2007) note that their work agrees\nwith the findings of Clark and Grant (2005) on how the form of the adaptive response\ncurve of individual bacteria affects their ability to accumulate.\nOther recent work on developing multiscale models of bacterial chemotaxis using\nequation-free methods has been undertaken by Setayeshgar et al. (2005), Erban and Oth-\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1595\nmer (2004, 2005). Setayeshgar et al. (2005) describe the microscopic behavior of a single\nbacterium using a system of equations of the form\ndy\ndt\n= f (y,S), (28)\nwhere y = (y1, y2, y3, . . . , yN) \u2208 RN are internal state variables of the bacterium describ-\ning for instance, the CheYP concentration, and S = (S1, S2, S3, . . . , SM) \u2208 RM are the\nexternal signals received by the bacterium. This microscopic description is closed by as-\nsuming that the time dependent evolution of the density of the bacterial colony is the rel-\nevant macroscopic variable. No equation representing the cell density is actually solved,\nand hence the method is referred to as \u201cequation-free\u201d.\nApplying this theory, Setayeshgar et al. (2005) propose a simplified model of excitation\nand adaptation\ndu1\ndt\n= (f (s) \u2212 u2) \u2212 u1\n\u03c4\u0011\n,\ndu2\ndt\n= (f (s) \u2212 u2)\n\u03c4a\n, (29)\nwhere u1 is the deviation in concentration of CheYP from its steady-state, u2 is the num-\nber of methylated receptors per unit volume per cell and \u03c4\u0011 and \u03c4a are the excitation and\nadaptation times, respectively. Here \u03c4\u0011 \t \u03c4a . The cell response is described by a two-state\nstochastic model\nCCWi\nk+\n\u0002\nk\u2212\nCWi , i = 1, . . . ,N, (30)\nwhere the subscript i denotes the individual bacterium, CCWi is the counter-clockwise\n(chemotaxis) state, CWi is the clockwise (random motion) state, and N is the number\nof bacteria per colony. The transition rates k+ and k\u2212 are assumed to depend upon the\nconcentration of CheYP . Monte Carlo simulations of the system show that given the large\nseparation in timescales of an individual bacterium responding to a stimulus (excitation\nand adaptation) to that of the overall evolving distribution of the bacterial colony, allows\ncoarse graining via the macroscopic description and results in reduced computation time.\nErban and Othmer (2004) incorporated the above microscopic description into a\nmacroscopic description of bacterial chemotaxis as defined by the telegraph process of\nEqs. (13) and (14). The turning rates were assumed to depend on the concentration of\nCheYP . By use of appropriate scalings and moment closure techniques, they derive both\na hyperbolic system of equations and the classical parabolic K\u2013S description of chemo-\ntaxis. Expressions for the form of the chemotactic coefficient in terms of individual state\nvariables are derived as\n\u03c7 = f \u2032(S(x)) bs\n2\u03c4a\n\u03bb0(1 + 2\u03bb0\u03c4a)(1 + 2\u03bb0\u03c4e) , (31)\nwhere s is the speed of the individual bacterium, \u03bb0 = k(y1) + by1 and f is a prescribed\nfunction of the signal S(x). Interestingly, this result shows that the chemotactic response\nvanishes as the adaptation time tends to zero. Including finite tumbling times shows that\nthe classical chemotaxis equations for both the tumbling and non-tumbling cases only\nmarginally differ. They generalize these results to higher dimensions (Erban and Othmer,\n1596 Tindall et al.\n2005) and discuss the importance of using different mathematical techniques to solve the\ngoverning equations describing individual cell behavior for a large number of bacteria in\na reasonable time.\n4. Modeling interactions between bacterial populations\nMotivated by their work modeling one bacterial species Lauffenburger et al. (1982) and\nLauffenburger and Calcagno (1983) considered a mathematical model to describe the\ncompetition between two microbial populations. The authors do not include chemotaxis in\ntheir model and consider the effect this has on the spatial and temporal behavior of the bac-\nterial distributions within a defined region. The model exhibits three possible steady-states\n(one of coexistence, two of either population being excluded) with coexistence shown to\nbe possible even when one population has a smaller growth rate and is less motile. A\nspecies with a smaller maximal growth rate in a confined, non-mixed environment may\nactually grow to a larger population size dependent upon the strength of their motility\nresponse to attractants. While they allude to experimental work in the area of mixed pop-\nulations, they note no direct experimental work exists to verify or refute their findings.\nLauffenburger et al. (1987) considered competition between two bacterial populations\nand compared model outcomes where bacteria move either by diffusion or chemotaxis\nor both. Their work began by considering a model in which the tumbling probability de-\npended on the time rate of change of receptor occupancy. They formulated a K\u2013S model\nand derived the relations between the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients and the mi-\ncroscopic tumbling behavior. They assumed that the number of bound receptors decreases\nsigmoidally with respect to attractant concentration, as described by Brown and Berg\n(1974). It was noted that models in which the tumbling probability depends on the change\nin the total number of bound receptors versus the time rate of change of receptor occu-\npancy leads to models that predict abnormally large attractant gradients. Lauffenburger\net al. (1987) undertook experimental work to quantify \u03bc and \u03c7 and noted that model so-\nlutions, using the derived parameters, agreed well with experimental findings. This model\nwas then extended to the case of two bacterial populations. Simulations showed that cell\nmotility is more important than growth kinetics (in this case Monod kinetics)4 in gov-\nerning competition between non-mixed populations. Chemotaxis can help a population\nto \u201cwin\u201d, if its growth kinetics are poor, so long as the chemotaxis to diffusion ratio is\nhigh (Lauffenburger et al., 1987 note it must be greater than 10 for their chosen parameter\nvalues).\nKelly et al. (1988) considered a similar problem to that of Lauffenburger et al. (1987):\ncompetition between two bacterial populations in a confined, non-mixed region with a\nsingle nutrient supply. They considered transient and steady-state numerical solutions to\ntheir governing equations which include descriptions of cell growth and death. They then\nfocused on the role that diffusion and chemotaxis play in the competition between the\ntwo populations. As with Lauffenburger et al. (1987) they show that both populations\n4Monod kinetics is similar to that of Michaelis\u2013Menten, but where an inhibitor complex binds with the\nenzyme at the same time as the substrate. The inhibitor and substrate are thus in competition for the\nenzyme. This leads to the additional reaction I + E\nk3\n\u0002\nk\u22123\nIE.\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1597\ncan co-exist or one population out-competes the other. They note that unlike the case of\na well-mixed system, the population in which growth is slower can co-exist so long as\nits ability to diffuse and chemotact is greater than that of the opposing population. They\nobtain a lower bound on the chemotactic coefficient in order for a population to be more\ncompetitive than an immotile one in a non-mixed environment.\n5. Modeling bacteria and their environment\nA number of researchers have sought to model the interactions which occur between\nbacterial populations and their surrounding media. Dillon et al. (1995) considered the in-\nteractions which occur between bacteria, the attractant substrate and their surrounding\nfluid environment. The fluid was modeled by the Navier\u2013Stokes equation, inertial effects\nbeing ignored, with an appropriate force term describing the fluid-body interaction for\na set number of bacteria, modeled as discrete elastic rings with an associated deforma-\ntion energy. The chemoattractant was assumed to be consumed according to Michaelis\u2013\nMenten reaction kinetics and transport was described by an advection-diffusion equation,\nthe velocity being that of the fluid. The derived model also included a simplified model\nof flagella rotation (Stokelets) as first considered by Lighthill (1975). Numerical simula-\ntions showed that hydrodynamic interactions between pairs of swimming bacteria can be\nimportant when the distance between them is less than a cell length (including flagella).\nNutrient uptake was shown to depend not only on the Peclet number (the ratio of advective\nto diffusive effects), but also on uptake rate. Simulations showed that if the uptake rate is\nlow, then swimming has negligible effect on the quantity of attractant consumed, but if\nattractant consumption is high, then slow swimming cells, moving up attractant gradients,\ncan consume nutrient faster than either non-motile cells or those swimming down the gra-\ndient. Dillon et al. (1995) concluded that models which ignore bacterial-fluid interactions\ncan give poor predictions on nutrient uptake.\nOther researchers have focused in more detail on modeling the hydrodynamic in-\nteractions which occur between bacteria and the surrounding fluid (Lighthill, 1975;\nPedley and Kessler, 1992; Ramia et al., 1993; Goto et al., 2005; Lauga et al., 2006).\nUnlike Dillon et al. (1995), such work does not consider macroscale descriptions of bac-\nterial distributions, the surrounding fluid environment, the transport of chemoattractant,\nor interactions between them.\n6. Pattern formation and bacterial chemotaxis\nWhile our work here has focused primarily on models which have directly elucidated the\nbehavior of bacterial populations, we briefly mention work which has considered model-\ning pattern formation in bacterial colonies. A more comprehensive list of papers relevant\nto pattern formation in bacterial chemotactic systems can be found in Erban and Othmer\n(2005).\nPattern formation is a result of self-organization within the species being studied and\nmany biological systems exhibit such behavior (Murray, 1993). In the case of bacterial\nchemotaxis, such patterns are often observed in petri dishes (Budrene and Berg, 1991;\nBen-Jacob et al., 1994, 1995; Berg, 1996). Indeed pattern formation models have gener-\nally been based on K\u2013S models. Such work often considers the effect of varying reaction-\nkinetics on the generated patterns and parameter limits which lead to instabilities (Zhu\n1598 Tindall et al.\nTable 2 Various model parameters used in continuum models of bacterial populations.

Hillesdon et al. (1995) considered the effect that\nvarying forms of the cell swimming speed, Heaviside or exponential, have on the move-\nment of B. subtilis in petri dishes of varying vertical depths. Work has also focused on the\neffect that secretion of chemoattractant by the bacteria has on the formation of bacterial\npatterns (Brenner et al., 1998).\n7. Parameter values\nMany of the models reviewed here have relied on using parameter values determined\nby the various experimental assays detailed in the Introduction. As noted, mathematical\nmodels have been developed to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the exper-\nimentally observed behavior. By iterating between model and experimental comparison,\nimprovements to model fits of experimental data have been made by adjusting the vari-\nous model parameters. This general methodology has allowed estimates to macroscopic\nparameters such as diffusion and chemotactic coefficients, bacterial growth, and death\nrates and chemoattractant consumption rates to be made. Once accurate predictions of\nparameter values have been made, these can then be used to make model predictions and\nsimulations of the behavior of bacterial populations in the natural environment.\nA brief list of common macro- and micro-scopic parameters is provided in Table 2. The\npapers of Ford and Lauffenburger (1991b) and Ford et al. (1991) are but two examples\nof authors who have focused on determining parameter values through comparison of\nmodel outcomes with experimental data. For a summary of diffusion and chemotactic\ncoefficients derived by comparison with experiments for different chemotactic species,\ndiscussion on the various assay methods used to determine these and their various sources,\nthe reader is referred to Lewus and Ford (2001). As noted there, the differences in reported\nvalues for the chemotactic and diffusion coefficients of up to two orders of magnitude is\na result of \u201cdifferences in bacterial species\/strains, growth medium, growth conditions,\nexperiment type, and experimental conditions.\u201d\n8. Summary and discussion\nThe development of mathematical models within the field of bacterial chemotaxis has\nallowed the importance of macroscopic and microscopic mechanisms which affect the\nspatio-temporal behavior of bacterial populations to be elucidated.\nOur review work here has covered a range of models. A number of continuum models,\nbased upon that originally devised by Keller and Segel (1971b), have been developed to\nMathematical Approaches to Bacterial Chemotaxis II: Populations 1599\nunderstand the bacterial response to chemoattractants using a number of in vitro assay\nmethods. Such work has often been carried out in parallel with experiment allowing good\nestimates of model parameters to be made. The ability of the Keller\u2013Segel equations to\naccurately reproduce experimental findings has meant that this generic model framework\nis still widely used today in the study, not only of bacterial chemotaxis populations, but\nalso of other biological systems which exhibit chemotaxis (Murray, 1993).\nModeling work has also continued to incorporate individual cell behavior into overall\nmacroscopic descriptions of bacterial distributions. The initial work of Segel (1976, 1977)\nsimply considered the change in distributions generated by bacteria with differential re-\nceptor confirmations moving along a one-dimensional line. Alt\u2019s seminal work (Alt, 1980)\nsought to obtain descriptions including more individual effects such as turn angle and in-\ndividual run time. Since analyzed in detail, the comparison between various K\u2013S models\nand reduced forms of Alt\u2019s original equations have allowed macroscopic parameters such\nas the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients to be expressed in terms of individual micro-\nscopic ones. More recently equation-free methods have been used to predict macroscopic\nbehavior from microscopic descriptions of single cell intracellular biochemistry without\nthe need for explicit derivation of equations describing macroscopic behavior. Such meth-\nods have been shown to be computationally less intensive than other multiscale schemes.\nWe note that in developing macroscale population descriptions, it is important that these\nare based upon the correct assumptions. For instance, the density of cells and concentra-\ntion of chemoattractant is large enough to warrant a continuum description such as that\ndeveloped by Keller and Segel. In cases where these assumptions do not hold the K\u2013S\ntheory of chemotaxis is no longer valid and other methods must be employed (Newman\nand Grima, 2004).\nExperimentally, a number of questions regarding the response of individual bacteria to\nchanges in extracellular attractant concentration remain, as yet, unanswered. Such ques-\ntions relate to small changes which bacteria can sense over the large order range of at-\ntractant concentration, specifically sensitivity, gain, and adaptation. The importance such\nmechanisms have on the macroscale behavior of bacterial populations is as yet unclear,\nalthough recent work has elucidated the importance of adaptation in the bacterial response\non bacterial aggregation (Bray et al., 2007). In order to incorporate such microscale mech-\nanisms at the macroscale level, further use of multiscale modeling methods is required.\nThere remain a number of important questions to be answered on the single cell scale\nas we have noted in a recent review on modeling within individual bacteria (Tindall et al.,\n2007). Improved understanding on the individual cell scale, combined with new modeling\ntechniques to incorporate such affects on the population scale, will ensure comprehensive,\nbut tractable models are developed, thereby aiding our understanding of bacterial cell\npopulations.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Julie Simons for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.
