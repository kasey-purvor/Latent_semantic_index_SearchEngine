The high TMR exhibited by such AlOx MTJs is\npartially attributed to the excellent quality of the interfaces.\nSystematic differences between barrier widths determined by\nx-ray scattering and electrical measurements4 in devices with\na lower TMR have been attributed to the effects of noncon-\nformal roughness, whereby the tunneling begins locally at\npositions of minimum thickness.\nAmorphous CoFeB electrodes have the advantage of be-\ning homogenous in the very small scales required for high-\ndensity recording media which are not possible with poly-\ncrystalline electrodes. Associated with crystallization at\nelevated temperature is a rise in coercivity5 of AlOx MTJs\nfabricated with Co60Fe20B20 electrodes.6 There is also a simi-\nlar rise in the RA product. However, prior to crystallization,\nthere is a significant increase in TMR \u0001Ref. 7\u0002 and a low-\ntemperature anneal can significantly enhance the perfor-\nmance of MTJs. Recent high-resolution electron microscopy\nresults have been interpreted as evidence for an association\nbetween the smoothness or sharpness of the electrode\/barrier\ninterface and a high TMR,8,9 and the micrographs of Li et\nal.10 suggest incipient crystallization of the CoFeB on an-\nnealing at 265 \u00b0C. We have undertaken in situ x-ray reflec-\ntivity measurements to search for changes in the interface\nstructure during annealing below the crystallization tempera-\nture and relate the improved magnetotransport to such struc-\ntural changes.\nHigh-resolution grazing incidence x-ray scattering ex-\nperiments have been performed at the SRS synchrotron ra-\ndiation source at Daresbury Laboratory. In situ reflectivity\nmeasurements were made during annealing in vacuo in the\ninduction furnace on station 2.3 using alignment and data\ncollection techniques that are now standard. A wavelength \u0004\nof 0.13 nm was chosen to maximize the intensity from the\nbending magnet; a channel-cut 111 Si crystal acted as the\nmonochromator. Samples were prepared by magnetron sput-\ntering on plasma-etched thermally oxidized Si wafers. An\nexchange bias pinned Co60Fe20B20 electrode and AlOx tunnel\nbarrier were deposited on a SiO2 substrate with an IrMn\nantiferromagnetic pinning layer: SiO2\/Ta\u00015 nm\u0002\/Ru\u000130 nm\u0002\/\nIrMn\u00018 nm\u0002\/Co60Fe20B20\u00013 nm\u0002\/AlOx\u00011.2 nm\u0002\/Ta\u00015 nm\u0002\/\nRu\u00015 nm\u0002. No free electrode was deposited on the AlOx in\norder for there to be only one CoFeB\/AlOx interface. The\nreflectivity was measured continuously during annealing.\nOff-specular measurements indicated that the interfaces\nwere all very smooth, resulting in very little diffuse scatter.\nThe specular scatter profile was very rich in detail \u0001Fig. 1\u0002\nand true specular scatter extended out to a detector angle \u0005\nof about 6\u00b0 \u0001or qz= \u00012\u0006 \/\u0004\u0002sin\u0005=5.05 nm\u22121\u0002. \u0001The true\nspecular scatter is the measured specular intensity minus the\na\u0002Electronic mail: b.k.tanner@durham.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

In particular, the low-\nfrequency modulation, of about 0.6\u00b0 in detector angle \u0001\u0007qz\n=0.5 nm\u22121\u0002, which is associated with the surface oxide layer,\nwas not affected by the annealing, indicating that no signifi-\ncant degradation of the top surface was occurring. There is a\nvery great change in the reflectivity curve between 340 \u00b0C\nand 400 \u00b0C, corresponding to the crystallization of the\nCo60Fe20B20. In particular, by 400 \u00b0C, there is a significant\nreduction in the fringe amplitude, characteristic of increased\ninterface width.\nThe specular scatter of the as-grown samples was mod-\neled using the Bede REFS-MERCURY software which uses a\ngenetic algorithm to refine the model structure to the experi-\nmental data. An example of the level of correspondence\nachieved is shown in Fig 2. The best fit parameters are listed\nin Table I.\nThere are regions of the reflectivity profile where a sys-\ntematic change in the fringe structure is observed as a func-\ntion of annealing temperature, a particularly prominent one\nbeing in the range of a scattering vector between 4 and\n5.5 nm\u22121 \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002. Here, as the annealing temperature is\nraised, the fringe amplitude increases markedly. Upon raising\nthe temperature, the reflectivity changes occurred rapidly and\nwe were unable to record the time dependence. By the typi-\ncal time of 10 min, taken for the temperature ramp to take\nplace, equilibrium had been reached. The data shown in Fig.\n3 correspond to the stable fringe amplitude, in this case after\nannealing for 2 h.\nThe key amplitude changes occur at quite high scattering\nvector, corresponding to changes to small out-of-plane length\nscales. In addition, there is an additional fringe appearing\nbetween 5 and 7 nm\u22121 and corresponding shift in the fringe\nmaxima. Four independent annealing runs have been carried\nout, all exhibiting the same fringe amplitude increase and\nfringe shift.\nExtensive modeling work on specular x-ray reflectivity\ndata has shown that an increase in width of a buried inter-\nface, whether as a result of topological roughness or chemi-\ncal intermixing, always results in reduction of interference\nfringe amplitude.11 The increase in interference fringe ampli-\ntude shown in Fig. 3 can only be explained by a reduction in\nthe width of one or more interfaces during the annealing\nprocess.\nIt has proved to be difficult to model the change in the\ninterface width by fitting the whole reflectivity profile and\nallowing all parameters to float freely. We have therefore\nfitted the data at 20 \u00b0C very carefully, deducing a\nCo60Fe20B20\/AlOx interface width of 0.52\u00b10.03 nm, and\nthen simulated the effect of changing this interface width in\nthe region wavevector in which the changes in fringe ampli-\ntude were observed experimentally. This simulation is shown\nas an inset to Fig 3. Using the 20 \u00b0C point as a standard,\ncomparison between the observed fringe amplitude change\nand the simulation enables us to deduce the\nCo60Fe20B20\/AlOx interface width as a function of annealing\ntemperature \u0001Fig. 4\u0002.\nIf the interface width reduction was due to a topological\nsmoothing of the interface, a corresponding reduction in\nthe diffuse scatter should have been observed. In both trans-\nverse and longitudinal scans \u0001Fig. 1\u0002 of the diffuse scatter\nin reciprocal space, we observed no such change. There is\nremarkably little diffuse scatter from this system, as a result\nof the interfaces being extremely smooth, and we were un-\nable to measure the diffuse scatter at the wavevector corre-\nsponding to that at which the specular scatter was found to\nchange. We therefore performed similar experiments on\n\u0003Co60Fe20B20\/AlOx\u00045 multilayers. An increase in the ampli-\ntude of the specular Bragg peak was observed upon anneal-\nTABLE I.

Unlike the data in Fig. 1, the result must be\nviewed with caution as there is no built-in verification that\nthe alignment had not altered, thereby resulting in an artifi-\ncial change in the specular intensity. However, measurements\nof the diffuse scatter through the first multilayer Bragg peak\nin the qx direction of reciprocal space \u0001Fig. 5\u0002 are not subject\nto this artefact. At all temperatures studied, there is no\nchange in the amount or distribution of the diffuse scatter.\nFurther, there was no change in the height or width of the\nassociated Bragg peak in the diffuse scatter recorded in a\ncoupled scan with the specimen offset from the specular con-\ndition. This is firm confirmation that the conformal topologi-\ncal roughness does not change during the annealing. The\noverall conclusion is that the Co60Fe20B20\/AlOx interface\nwidth reduction arises from a sharpening of the composition\nchange across the interface, diffusion driven by the chemical\npotential. As the TMR rises to a maximum at the temperature\nat which the interface width falls to its lowest value, the\nimplication is that the tunneling probability is enhanced by\nthe sharpening of the interface.\nThe temperature at which the x-ray scattering indicates\nsharpening of the Co60Fe20B20\/AlOx interface corresponds\ndirectly to the temperature at which the maximum TMR\noccurs.\n7 This sharpening takes place in the amorphous phase\nof Co60Fe20B20, well below the crystallization temperature\ndetermined by high-angle x-ray diffraction, and provides\ndirect evidence of the importance of interface structure in\ndetermining the magnitude of the TMR in MTJ devices.\nFinancial support was partly provided by the UK Engi-\nneering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
