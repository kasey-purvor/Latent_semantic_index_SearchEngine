The reaction follows the van Slyke-Cullen mechanism, a special case of\nthe Michaelis-Menten reaction. We perform the analysis both with and without apply-\ning the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation.

The reduced model does not demonstrate this behaviour. Our\nresults have important implications in the analysis of open biochemical reactions and\nthe modelling of metabolic systems.\nKeywords: single enzyme-substrate reaction, open reactions, quasi-steady-state approxima-\ntion, model reduction, modelling metabolic pathways\n1 Introduction\nThe aim of modelling reaction mechanisms and biochemical pathways is to clarify the\nnature of reaction intermediates and their interactions (how they react with, or transform\ninto, each other), and to determine the rates of these transformations. Mechanisms are\ninvestigated mathematically through two distinct approaches: stoichiometric and kinetic\nmodels. The stoichiometric model is based on the time-invariant characteristics of the\nreactions and describes the system pathway, known as its connectivity [1]. The kinetic\nmodel is based on both the stoichiometry and reaction rates. Here, the individual inter-\nactions in the mechanism are assigned appropriate kinetic properties, known as rate laws\n[1, 2].\nOf the two, therefore, kinetics models are more complete and provide a greater under-\nstanding of the system behaviour. To produce such models, however, we require knowledge\n1\nof the reaction stoichiometry and detailed information about the kinetics of a reaction\npathway. Consider the following pathway scheme:\nS1\nv1\n\u000f\u000f\nS6\nS2\nv2\n\/\/ S3\nv3\n\/\/ 2S4\nv4\n\/\/ S5\nv5\nOO\nBC@A\nGF\n\u2212\n\/\/\n(1)\nIn this scheme we show a biochemical pathway in which a product S6 is synthesised\nfrom a substrate S1 through the four intermediates S2, S3, S4 and S5. The pathway has\nnegative feedback in the production of S2, caused by the later intermediate S5. Based on\nthe stoichiometry, we can write the mass balance equations [1, 2, 3]. The rate of change\nof intermediate S4, for example, is\nds4\ndt\n= 2 v3 \u2212 v4 , (2)\nwhere vi are the reaction rates, or fluxes, and s4 is the concentration of the intermediate\nspecies S4. In this paper we will use upper case notation to represent the names of different\nchemical species, and lower case letters to represent their corresponding concentrations.\nHere we consider that the system is well-mixed, or there is no mass flow due to convection\nor diffusion. The algebraic expression for the reaction rates vi will depend on the kinet-\nics under consideration. Many biochemists employ phenomenological rate laws derived\nempirically [4]. There are several common approaches used to derive kinetic functions:\nmass action kinetics, Michaelis-Menten type and allosteric kinetics, and the power-law\napproximation, which we have recently summarised [1, 5].\nIdeally, the mechanisms underlying biochemical pathways are described by incorporat-\ning all of the elementary steps of the enzyme-substrate association-dissociation, isomeri-\nsation of intermediates and formation of products. A major problem with this method of\nmodelling complex biochemical pathways is that it produces systems of highly-nonlinear\ndifferential equations with many kinetic and stoichiometric parameters [1]. Typically these\nsystems are stiff and have multiple timescales [6]. Consequently their numerical solutions\nare computationally demanding. This also makes data-fitting difficult [7, for a general\ndiscussion].\nThe kinetic modelling of enzymatic reactions can be simplified considerably if the\noverall reaction is studied with the aid of the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA),\nsometimes referred to as the Pseudo-Steady-State Hypothesis. This originates from the\nempirical observation that, in some cases, the reaction intermediates are short-lived rel-\native to the other reactants. Successful application of the QSSA requires there to be\nseparation of timescales between the fast and slow reacting species [8, 9]. Employing the\nQSSA simplifies the model by reducing the dimension of the system of equations. We set\nthe differential equation governing the reaction intermediates equal to zero, which produces\nan algebraic expression. This application of the QSSA has been a commonly used tool in\nthe modelling of biochemical networks since the late 1960s [10]. In fact, the QSSA has\nbeen systematically employed in chemical kinetics for more than 80 years [11]. Metabolic\ncontrol theory, a widely use sensitivity analysis technique for biochemical systems, also\nrelies on the application of the QSSA [2, 12]. We can see, then, that the identification of\nthe appropriate timescales and ranges of validity for the simplification of enzyme kinetics\nis of great importance. Over the last ten years, we have determined the timescales of the\n2\nreacting species and validity of the QSSA in isolated enzyme reactions [8, 11, 13, 14]. Re-\ncently, the effects of substrate input on the validity of the QSSA for open enzyme reactions\nhas also been considered [15, 16].\nThe coupling of an enzyme\u2013substrate reaction to metabolic pathways may lead to\nthe appearance of weakly damped or even sustained oscillations [17, 18]. However, the\ndynamical consequences of reducing open biochemical systems using the QSSA has not\nbeen systematically explored. In this paper, we examine the transient kinetic behaviour\nof an open single enzyme, single substrate reaction following the Van Slyke-Cullen mecha-\nnism [19] (Sections 3\u20134). This is a very similar mechanism to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten\none, differing only in that there is no reverse reaction from the complex back to the sub-\nstrate. The dynamics of both are similar; we choose the simpler one for our demonstration.\nWe perform the analysis both with and without applying the QSSA (Section 5). We show\nthat the two analyses can produce qualitatively different results, in which case one must\nbe cautious in the application of the QSSA. The paper is concluded with a brief discussion\n(Section 6).\n2 The Van Slyke-Cullen reaction mechanism\nWe consider an isolated enzyme reaction following the Van Slyke-Cullen mechanism [19].\nThis is the simplest single enzyme, single substrate reaction mechanism. Here we have an\nenzyme E and a substrate S which bind, irreversibly, to form an intermediate enzyme-\nsubstrate complex C. This complex then breaks down, irreversibly, to form a product\nP :\nv1\n\/\/ S + E\nk1\n\/\/ C\nk2\n\/\/ E + P\nv2\n\/\/\nED'&\n\u2212\n\u000f\u000f\n(3)\nHere k1 and k2 are positive rate constants, v1 and v2 are rate functions. Applying the law\nof mass action, we obtain the following system of ordinary differential equations:\ns\u2032 = v1(p)\u2212 k1se ,\ne\u2032 = \u2212k1se+ k2c ,\nc\u2032 = k1se\u2212 k2c ,\np\u2032 = k2c\u2212 v2(p) . (4)\nIn this system, the variables s, e, c and p are mathematical representations of the concen-\ntrations of the reaction molecules S, E, C and P . The enzyme is conserved: e\u2032 + c\u2032 = 0,\nwhich integrates to give e+ c = constant \u2261 e0. Here e0 denotes the total enzyme concen-\ntration. We use substitute e0 \u2212 c for e and thus simplify the system to three equations:\ns\u2032 = v1(p)\u2212 k1s(e0 \u2212 c) ,\nc\u2032 = k1s(e0 \u2212 c)\u2212 k2c ,\np\u2032 = k2c\u2212 v2(p) . (5)\nWe rescale the variables in order to remove the rate constants k1 and k2 from the system:\ns =\nk2\nk1\ns\u00af , c =\nk2\nk1\nc\u00af , p =\nk2\nk1\np\u00af , t =\n1\nk2\nt\u00af . (6)\n3\nThe resultant form has only one explicit parameter, e\u00af0 = k1e0\/k2:\n\u02d9\u00afs = v\u00af1(p\u00af)\u2212 s\u00af(e\u00af0 \u2212 c\u00af) ,\n\u02d9\u00afc = s\u00af(e\u00af0 \u2212 c\u00af)\u2212 c\u00af ,\n\u02d9\u00afp = c\u00af\u2212 v\u00af2(p\u00af) . (7)\nThe rescaled functions are v\u00afi(p\u00af) = k1vi(p)\/k\n2\n2\n. We drop the bars and revert to dashes\ninstead of dots to refer to differentiation in this rescaled system.\nFor general vi, this is the simplest form and the system remains three-dimensional.\nThere are some specific cases where further reduction is possible, which we consider before\nwe embark on the full analysis.\n3 Flux considerations of the reaction\nIn some circumstances the product does not have any influence over the reaction kinetics\nof the reactants. This yields a far simpler system \u2013 a two-dimensional one \u2013 with a limited\nrange of dynamics possible. There are two causes of this situation for our example, but\nhere they are not entirely distinct.\n3.1 Mass conservation\nWe expect mass to be conserved within the system, over time. For general vi this remains\nan implicit consideration:\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\ns\u2032 + c\u2032 + p\u2032 = 0. Without knowing the system solution,\nwe cannot evaluate this integral. There is, however, a case where we can perform the\nintegral without having found the solution explicitly: for v1 \u2212 v2 = constant \u2261 v we\nhave s\u2032 + c\u2032 + p\u2032 = v. This constant must then be zero, and thus v1 = v2. However, for\nrealistic vi we could expect dv2\/dp \u2265 0, and for negative feedback (creating a homeostatic\nenvironment) dv1\/dp \u2264 0. In this case, the net result is dv1\/dp = 0 = dv2\/dp, which\nmeans we end up with v1 = v2 = constant. Since mass conservation holds explicitly the\nsystem reduces to two dimensions by substituting s0 \u2212 s\u2212 c for p.\nThe limiting case of this constraint is vi \u2261 0. We refer to this as the closed form, since\nthere is no input or output.\nIt is possible to imagine functions vi that are equal and faintly realistic, without be-\ning constant. An example might be vi(p) = 1 \u2212 cos(p) [16]. This is difficult to justify\nbiologically: the supply and sink functions matching exactly would either be a strange\ncoincidence or a strongly connected system.\n3.2 No feedback\nIn the case v1(p) = constant, p is separable: the dynamics of s and c do not depend on\np. The dynamic of p does however depend on s and c and so its behaviour is evaluated\nonce theirs is known. We write p(s, c) and we see that the system is effectively reduced to\ntwo dimensions: s and c. This is the same result as the mass conservation consideration\nabove, achieved with a weaker constraint (which encompasses the earlier constraint).\n3.3 Analysis\nOne of the best ways to understand the behaviour of chemical reactions is by using dy-\nnamical systems techniques to study their evolution in the phase space [14, 6, 20, 21].\n4\nExamining the nullsurfaces is a good first step in analysing the phase space of the system.\nHere we have\ns =\nv1\ne0 \u2212 c\nfor s\u2032 = 0 ,\nc =\ne0s\n1 + s\nfor c\u2032 = 0 . (8)\nThe intersection of the two nullsurfaces give the steady state:\n(\nv1\ne0 \u2212 v1\n, v1\n)\n. We see that\n0 < v1 < e0. If we revert to the original coordinate system we see that the steady state\nhas quantitative dependence on the rate constants ki:\n(\nv1\nk1(e0 \u2212 v1)\n,\nv1\nk2\n)\n.\nWe investigate the local behaviour around this steady-state using local stability anal-\nysis. We linearise the core system by calculating the Jacobian:\nLs\u2032 =\n(\n\u2212e s\ne \u2212s\u2212 1\n)\nLs . (9)\nIn using e here we intend the rescaled one, but still as defined previously: e = e0 \u2212 c. At\nthe steady state we have:\nLs\u2032 =\n(\n\u2212e\u22c6 v1\/e\u22c6\ne\u22c6 \u2212e0\/e\u22c6\n)\nLs . (10)\nWe look for the eigenvalues:\n\u03bb2 +\n(\ne0\ne\u22c6\n+ e\u22c6\n)\n\u03bb+ e\u22c6 = 0 . (11)\nThe eigenvalues are real and negative, which indicates a stable node.\nThe phase space trajectories for system (7) with v1, v2 constant, and its c\n\u2032 = 0 nullsur-\nface are shown in Figure 1. Note that the trajectories departing from c = 0 horizontally\ncross the c\u2032 = 0 nullsurface. The trajectory flow is attracted by a unique trajectory, a\nslow invariant manifold, and all trajectories tend to the point\n(\nv1\ne0 \u2212 v1\n, v1, s0\n)\n, which is\nthe chemical equilibrium (a stable node), as t \u2192 \u221e. For the Michaelis\u2013Menten reaction\nmechanism, after an initial transient, trajectories eventually lie close to the slow invariant\nmanifold, which is confined to the region bounded between the nullsurfaces [14, 20, 21, 22].\nIn Figure 1, we do not show the s nullsurface.\nThe QSSA is the idea that, after an initial rapid transition, the reaction will settle\nclose to the c nullsurface. Although time is not apparent in the phase diagram, it seems\nthat the QSSA is a good approximation for the latter stages of the reaction with constant\nflow, as is the case for the Michaelis\u2013Menten reaction [20, 23].\n4 Analysis of the full system\nHaving considered the reduced form, we now examine the general system. Again we\nconsider the nullsurfaces. For p\u2032 = 0, we find that c = v2(p), with s unconstrained.\n5\nFigure 1: Phase space for the Van Slyke-Cullen reaction (7) with constant flow, given by\nnumerical solution. Solid curves starting with circles are the trajectories. The surface is\nthe QSSA null surface (c\u2032 = 0). We see the trajectories initially heading directly towards\nthe null surface. As each trajectory approaches the surface it alters direction so as to\nremain close to it, while s continues to diminish, and p continues to increase. Note that\nthe steady state is node-like, not spiral. The rescaled parameters are here e0 = 2 and\nvi = 1.\n6\nThe c\u2032 = 0 plane is the same as for the previous system: c =\ne0s\n1 + s\n, with p free.\nThe s\u2032 nullsurface is a little more complex:\n(\nv1(p)\ne0 \u2212 c\n, c, p\n)\n. We find steady states for\np\u22c6 such that v1(p\u22c6) = v2(p\u22c6) \u2261 v\u22c6:\n(\nv\u22c6\ne0 \u2212 v\u22c6\n, v\u22c6, p\u22c6\n)\n. In the original system this is(\nv\u22c6\nk1(e0 \u2212 v\u22c6)\n,\nv\u22c6\nk2\n, p\u22c6\n)\n. Note that at the steady state, the net system flow is zero \u2013 thus\nwe see the system is well defined.\nWe evaluate the Jacobian at the steady state:\nJ =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u2212e\u22c6 v\u22c6\/e\u22c6 v\u20321e\u22c6 \u2212e0\/e\u22c6 0\n0 1 \u2212v\u2032\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (12)\nWe find the eigenvalue equation for the solution:\n\u03bb3 +\n(\ne\u22c6 +\ne0\ne\u22c6\n+ v\u20322\n)\n\u03bb2 +\n[(\ne\u22c6 +\ne0\ne\u22c6\n)\nv\u20322 + e\u22c6\n]\n\u03bb+ e\u22c6\n(\nv\u20322 \u2212 v\n\u2032\n1\n)\n= 0 . (13)\nWe know that e\u22c6 is positive, since it is the steady state of the free enzyme concentration,\nin the rescaled system. We gave properties of v\u2032i which tell us that v\n\u2032\n2\n\u2212v\u2032\n1\n\u2265 0. Thus every\nconstant in the polynomial is positive. This means that there are no real positive roots,\nso we must have at least one negative real root. It is possible that there are complex\nroots with positive real parts, in fact this arises for \u2212v\u2032\n1\n>\nf\ne\u22c6\n(\nv\u2032\n2\n2 + fv\u2032\n2\n+ e\u22c6\n)\n, where\nf \u2261 e\u22c6+\ne0\ne\u22c6\n. In this case we have a local unstable spiral in a plane about the steady state.\nThe phase space trajectories for system (7) and its c\u2032 = 0 nullsurface are shown in Fig-\nure 2. We choose v1 = 2\u2212p to satisfy both v1 \u2265 0 (for p \u2264 2) and dv1\/dp =\u2264 0. Similarly,\nv2 = 1 gives v2 \u2265 0 and dv2\/dp =\u2265 0. We see that the trajectories departing from c = 0\ncross the c\u2032 = 0 nullsurface almost perpendicularly, and then remain close to it. This\nfigure shows that the overall behaviour of this model can be qualitatively different to that\nof the Van Slyke-Cullen reaction mechanism with constant flow, shown in Figure 1. Here\nwe see that damped oscillations occur close to the QSSA surface (the c nullsurface). In\nthis case all trajectories eventually approach the steady state. This illustrates only one\npossible behaviour of the general system (7).\nThe simple source and sink functions chosen for this example are not valid for all initial\nconditions. Consideration of initial conditions is difficult to motivate in an open system:\nlong-term behaviour is primarily of interest.\n5 Applying the QSSA to the open mechanism\nThe standard practice in the modelling of complex biochemical pathways (which are usu-\nally open enzyme-substrate reactions) is applying the QSSA to reduce the number of\ndifferential equations in the system. Alternatively, expressions derived using the QSSA\n(for example, the Michaelis-Menten equation) are employed as reaction rates or fluxes\nin the mass balance equations [see, for example, Eq. (2)] in the models of biochemical\n7\nFigure 2: Phase space for the Van Slyke-Cullen reaction with linear flow given by the\nnumerical solution of (7). Solid curves starting with circles are the trajectories. The\nsurface is the QSSA null surface (c\u2032 = 0). We see the trajectories initially heading directly\ntowards the null surface. As each trajectory approaches the surface it alters direction so\nas to remain close to it. Note that the steady state is a spiral. The rescaled parameters\nare here e0 = 2, v1 = 2\u2212 p and v2 = 1.\npathways. Whilst we appreciate that this approximation is quite reasonable, we must be\ncareful in the use of it. We will show that the simplified system may be qualitatively\ndifferent from the original.\nDepending on the initial conditions, there can be an initial transient where there is\nrapid formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. After that, saturation of the complex\noccurs, and then the reaction becomes more steady. We see that the amount of complex\nchanges very slowly from now on: dc\/dt \u2248 0. Thus the QSSA is valid in the sense that it\nis close to the actual system behaviour. However, when we simplify the system using an\napproximation like this (and this is a very strong one, being at the heart of the system\u2019s\ndynamics) we must be careful not to remove from the model some of the behaviour which\nwe are interested in studying.\nWe consider the simplified system (7), then we apply the QSSA. This states that c\u2032 \u2248 0.\nFrom this we find an expression for c in terms of s:\nc \u2248\ne0s\n1 + s\n. (14)\nWe substitute this back into what remains of the system to give:\ns\u2032 \u2248 v1(p)\u2212\ne0s\n1 + s\n,\np\u2032 \u2248\ne0s\n1 + s\n\u2212 v2(p) . (15)\nWe have reduced the system from three species to two.\n8\n(a) Full system, given by the numerical solution\nof (7).

The steady state is a stable\nspiral.\nFigure 3: Phase space for the Van Slyke-Cullen reaction with linear flow. Solid curves\nstarting with circles are the trajectories. The surface is the QSSA nullsurface (c\u2032 = 0).\nWe see the trajectories initially heading towards the null surface. As each trajectory\napproaches the surface it alters direction so as to remain close to it. We see that the two\nmodels exhibit qualitatively different behaviour. The rescaled parameter e0 here is set to\n2, and the flow functions are v1 = 2\u2212 3.1p and v2 = 1.\n5.1 Analysis\nThe steady state is the same as for the full system. We investigate the stability of the\nsteady state by evaluating the Jacobian there:\nJ =\n(\n\u2212\u03b1 v\u2032\n1\n\u03b1 \u2212v\u2032\n2\n)\n. (16)\nwhere \u03b1 =\n(e0 \u2212 v\u22c6)\n2\ne0\n> 0. This then gives the following stability formula:\n\u03bb2 +\n(\n\u03b1+ v\u20322\n)\n\u03bb+ \u03b1\n(\nv\u20322 \u2212 v\n\u2032\n1\n)\n= 0 (17)\nWe see that the quadratic expression has only positive terms and so the only solution is\nfound for Re(\u03bb) < 0. Thus the steady state is always stable in the system reduced using\nthe QSSA.\nWe demonstrate this difference with an example. The phase space trajectories for\nsystem (7) and the same system with the QSSA applied (15) are shown in Figure 3.\nThe specific substrate supply function here is v1 = 2 \u2212 3.1p and the product removal is\nv2 = 1. The rescaled parameter e0 here is set to 2. These settings were the same for both\nnumerical solutions. In the full system we see a stable limit cycle occurring as the limiting\nbehaviour; in the system reduced by the QSSA the complex dynamic of the limit cycle\nhas been replaced with a relatively simple stable spiral.\nWe notice that there is a special case: v\u2032\n1\n\u2212 v\u2032\n2\n= 0, which yields \u03bb = 0. Here the full\nanalysis cannot give an answer. However, this is the condition which we studied earlier\n(Section 3).\n9\n6 Discussion\nThe QSSA is probably the most frequently used method for reducing the number of\nequations governing a complex biochemical pathway. In recent years, special attention\nhas been paid to the conditions for the validity of the QSSA in both closed [9, 11] and\nopen [15, 16] mechanisms. However, there has been little interest in understanding the\nimpact of the QSSA on the analysis of the dynamical behaviour of biochemical pathways.\nThe dynamical consequences of the application of the QSSA have been explored previ-\nously for some large systems. In 1974, a chemical mechanism of 81 species was compared\nwith the reduced version produced by applying the QSSA [24]. Critical differences were\nobserved between the full and reduced models, leading to the conclusion that the QSSA\nis, in general, not reliable, because it can conceal some aspects of the dynamics. More\nrecently, the non-linear system describing the allosteric reaction in [25] was reduced from\ntwelve equations to two by applying the QSSA. It was shown that using the QSSA changed\nthe perceived dynamical behaviour of the system. Unfortunately these results have not\nbeen widely accepted within the biochemical community. There is an assumption that\nthe long-term behaviour of most systems is to reach a steady state. The reduction of the\nmodel by the QSSA is considered acceptable because the long-term dynamic is assumed\nnot to change [2, for example]. A single enzyme, single substrate Michaelis\u2013Menten re-\naction mechanism has demonstrated both weakly damped oscillations (stable spiral) and\nsustained oscillations (limit cycle) when the reaction mechanism is coupled to other bio-\nchemical pathways [17]. Damped oscillations have also been generated in open reactions by\ncoupling very simple mechanisms, such as competitive inhibition of a single enzyme [26].\nIn this paper, we have investigated the dynamical effect of the QSSA in the simplest open\nenzyme\u2013substrate reaction. We have shown that it is possible to generate both damped\nand sustained oscillations in an open Van Slyke\u2013Cullen reaction. We demonstrate that\nthe use of the QSSA produces a reduced version of the model which fails to reveal the full\ndynamical behaviour of the system. In particular, we saw that the linear feedback mecha-\nnism can exhibit instability, including limit cycle behaviour (sustained oscillations), while\nthe reduced version \u2013 using the QSSA \u2013 cannot (see Figure 3). Our analysis contradicts\nthe general assumption that the use of the QSSA does not affect the long-term dynamics\nof the model.\nThis investigation shows that model reduction by the use of the QSSA can fail to\nreveal some important dynamical properties of the unreduced system. We hope that this\ndemonstrates to the biochemical community that care should be taken when modelling\ncomplex pathways. The use of the QSSA in reducing the system, or in deriving reaction\nrates or fluxes, is contra-indicted.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge support from NIH grant number R01GM076692.
