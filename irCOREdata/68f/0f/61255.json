Avoiding the \nmost hazardous areas by preventive planning is the safest strategy for development in \nsinkhole-prone areas. Corrective measures could be to reduce the dissolution activity \nand subsidence processes, but these are difficult. A more practical solution for safe \ndevelopment is to reduce the vulnerability of the structures by using subsidence-proof \ndesigns. \n \n \nKey words: sinkholes, evaporite karst, hazard assessment, mitigation \n \n \n Introduction \nThe dissolution of soluble rocks and deposits at the surface, or in the subsurface \ncombined with internal erosion and deformational processes, can produce closed \ndepressions called sinkholes or dolines. These hollows characterize karst landscapes and \nare usually sub-circular in plan varying in size up to hundreds of meters across, and \ntypically from a few meters to tens of meters deep (Williams 2003). The word doline, \nderived from the Slavic word dolina, is a term mainly used by European \ngeomorphologists. The term sinkhole is most commonly used in the international \nliterature when dealing with engineering and environmental issues. The generation of \nthese karstic depressions is related to the dissolution of carbonate and evaporitic rocks. \nSinkholes in evaporite karst areas occur worldwide (Klimchouk et al. 1996), and pose \nnumerous practical problems, but compared with sinkholes in carbonate karst terrains \nthey have received relatively scarce attention. Evaporite karst sinkholes also commonly \nshow a greater genetic diversity (Gutierrez et al. 2008b). Because of the higher \nsolubility and lower mechanical strength of evaporites, their susceptibility to sinkhole \n formation  is greater than that of carbonate karst terrains. The solubilities of gypsum \n(CaSO4 2H2O) and halite (NaCl) in distilled water are 2.4 and 360 gr\/l, respectively. By \ncomparison, the solubilities of calcite and dolomite minerals in natural environments are \ncommonly lower than 0.5 gr\/l, depending on the pH, which is largely controlled by the \nCO2 partial pressure (Ford and Williams 1989). Gypsum dissolution rates as high as 29 \nmm\/year have been measured in unconfined hydrogeological conditions in western \nUkraine (Klimchouk and Aksem 2005). In addition, the evaporites tend to have a more \nductile rheology than carbonate rocks, and their commonly lower strength may be \nreduced substantially on a human time scale by dissolution processes. Another \npeculiarity of evaporite karst is that subjacent dissolution may cause ground subsidence \non a regional scale. When these subsidence phenomena operate over long time periods, \nthey produce gravitational morphostructures, which may be up to several hundred \nkilometers in extent and hundreds of meters in structural relief. These include \ndepositional basins that may have geomorphic expression (Christiansen 1967; Johnson \n1989; Hill 1996), large collapse depressions (Guti\u00e9rrez 1996), concordant synclinal \nvalleys (Gustavson 1986), monoclinal flexures (Anderson and Hinds 1997; Warren \n1999; Cooper 2002; Kirkham et al. 2002), and grabens (Cater 1970; Doelling 2000; \nGuti\u00e9rrez, 2004). Additionally, where large-scale synsedimentary subsidence affects \nvalley reaches, it may generate dissolution-induced basins more than 100 m deep and \nseveral kilometers long filled with alluvial deposits (Guti\u00e9rrez 1996; Benito et al. 2000; \nGuerrero et al.2007). \n \nIn evaporite karst areas, gravitational deformation of the ground during sinkhole \ndevelopment may cause severe damage to buildings and other man-made structures \n(Cooper and Waltham 1999; Guti\u00e9rrez and Cooper 2002), including roads (Benson and \nKaufman 2001), railways (Guerrero et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2007a), dams (Gutierrez \net al. 2002; Johnson 2008b), canals and ditches (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2007a); even nuclear \npower stations like Neckarwestheim in Germany have been affected (Prof. H. Behmel, \npers. comm.) (Fig. 1). Subsidence phenomena caused by evaporite dissolution have a \nsubstantial detrimental effect on development in numerous regions of the world (Cooper \nand Calow, 1998; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2008a; Johnson, 2008a), and individual sinkhole \nevents may have a large financial impact. For example, in the Spanish cities of Oviedo \nand Calatayud situated on cavernous gypsum, the direct economic losses caused by \nsingle collapse events that affected buildings in 1998 and 2003 were estimated to be 18 \n and 4.8 million euros, respectively (M. Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol pers. comm. and Guti\u00e9rrez et \nal. 2004). Sinkholes may also cause the loss of human lives when they occur in a \ncatastrophic way. Thirty four people have been killed by sudden collapses in the \ndolomite karst of the Far West Rand of South Africa (Bezuidenhout and Enslin 1970). \nSeveral people have been swallowed and injured by sinkholes resulting from halite \ndissolution on the Dead Sea coast of Israel (Frumkin and Raz 2001). Other sinkhole \nproblems are related to hydrogeology and hydraulic structures. Sinkholes can act as \nwater-inlets connected to high-transmissivity karstic aquifers and cave systems making \nthe impoundment of water in reservoirs difficult (Pearson 1999; Milanovic 2000; \nJohnson 2008b). They can facilitate the rapid pollution of the groundwater (Paukstys \nand Narbutas 1996), and in places might affect the safety of sensitive structures such as \nthe radioactive waste WIPP repository in New Mexico (Hill 2003). Moreover, these \ntopographic depressions are frequently prone to flooding either by the concentration of \nsurface runoff or by groundwater flooding when the water table rising above their \nground level. This paper presents a basic methodological review of the assessment and \nmitigation of sinkhole hazards in evaporite karst areas, contrasting them with the \ndifferences these phenomena show in carbonate karst terrains. \n \n Processes, factors and the impact of human activity \nSeveral relatively similar genetic classifications of sinkholes have been recently \npublished (Williams 2003; Beck 2004; Waltham et al. 2005). However, the study of \npaleokarst reveals that the development of sinkholes in evaporite karst terrains involves \na wider range of processes than those used by the aforementioned classifications. \nGuerrero et al. (2008b) proposed a new genetic classification of sinkholes applicable to \nevaporite karst areas. It has similarities to Beck\u2019s (2004) sinkhole classification and the \nmost widely used landslide classifications, such as the one proposed by Cruden and \nVarnes (1996). With the exception of solution dolines, the scheme describes the \nsinkholes with compound terms: the first descriptor refers to the material affected by \ninternal erosion and deformational processes (cover, bedrock or caprock), and the \nsecond indicates the main type of process involved (collapse, suffosion or bending) \n(Fig. 2). In practice, more than one material type and several processes can be involved \nin the generation of many sinkholes. These complex sinkholes, classified as polygenetic \nby Williams (2003) and Beck (2004), could be described using combinations of the \n proposed terms with the dominant material or process followed by the secondary one \n(e.g. cover and bedrock collapse sinkhole, cover suffosion and bending sinkhole). \n \nTwo main genetic groups of sinkholes may be recognized: the solution sinkholes, \ngenerated by the differential dissolutional lowering of the ground in areas where the \nevaporites are exposed at the surface (bare or uncovered karst), and the different types \nof sinkholes resulting from both, subsurface dissolution and downward gravitational \nmovement (internal erosion and deformation) of the overlying material. Solution \nsinkholes are generally shallow depressions that may reach up to several hundred meters \nacross. The second group is obviously the most important from a ground stability and \nengineering perspective. The sinkholes generated over dissolutional voids by the \nupward propagation (stoping) caused by collapse of the cavity roofs are designated as \nbedrock collapse or caprock collapse sinkholes, depending on whether the cavity \nmigrates through karst or non-karst lithologies, respectively (Fig. 2). The formation of \nthese sinkholes may be related to deep-seated dissolutional voids involving the \ngeneration of breccia pipes that may reach several hundred meters in height (Johnson \n1989; Ford 1997; Yarou and Cooper 1997; Warren 1999). These sinkholes commonly \nshow a low probability of occurrence (Beck, 2004; Waltham et al. 2005), and are \ngenerally sharp-edged depressions up to a few tens of meters in diameter. The sinkholes \ngenerated by the progressive interstratal dissolution of the evaporitic bedrock and the \nconcurrent gradual bending of the overlying evaporitic or non-karstic bedrock may be \ntermed bedrock bending or caprock bending sinkholes, respectively (Fig. 2). This type \nof subsidence, which is particularly frequent in sequences with halite beds, may result in \ndepressions and troughs several kilometers in length (Kirkham et al. 2002).  \n \nThree main end members can be differentiated in areas where the evaporitic bedrock is \nmantled by a cover of allogenic sediments or residual soils (Fig. 2): (1) Cover bending \nsinkholes are caused by the differential lowering of the rockhead, which may lead to the \ngradual bending of the overlying mantle. These are commonly shallow depressions that \nmay reach several hundred meters in length. In this case, a thick karstic residue may \nform between the cover and the \u201cunweathered\u201d evaporitic bedrock. (2) Cover suffosion \nsinkholes result from the downward migration of the cover through dissolutional voids \n(raveling) and its ductile sagging. A wide range of processes may be involved in the \ndownward transport of the particles, including down-washing and viscous or \n cohesionless granular sediment gravity flows. These are commonly bowl-shaped \nhollows, and their diameter can range from a few meters to tens of meters. (3) Cover \ncollapse sinkholes form by the collapse of soil arches resulting from the upward \npropagation of breakdown cavities developed through a cohesive and brittle cover \nabove dissolutional voids. These sinkholes have scarped edges at the time of formation, \nand are commonly a few meters across to less than 10 meters, although in places they \nmay reach several tens of meters in diameter. The cover collapse and cover suffosion \nsinkholes account for the vast majority of the sinkhole damage, since these are the types \nwith the higher probabilities of occurrence (Beck 2004; Waltham et al. 2005). In many \ncases it is not possible to determine whether a collapse sinkhole in a mantled karst area \ncorresponds to a cover collapse or to a cover and bedrock collapse sinkhole. \n \nThere are several important practical aspects regarding the formation of collapse \nsinkholes. Of major concern is that they may form in a catastrophic way without \nshowing any previous noticeable warning signs. After formation they may grow in size \nbecause their scarped sides tend to degrade by mass wasting and erosion processes as \nthey evolve from a cylindrical to a cone then a bowl-shaped geometry, an evolution, \nwhich may be very rapid in cover collapse sinkholes. The volume of the collapse \nsinkholes at the time of formation provides a minimum estimate of the volume of the \nsubsurface cavities since voids may remain unfilled and the collapse material may bulk \nand undergo a reduction in density (Cooper, 1986). \n \nAn additional widely used term is buried sinkhole. This type refers to any sinkhole \nwithout topographic expression, regardless of its origin. It is important to note that \n\u201cburied\u201d does not mean necessarily inactive, since they may correspond to artificially \nfilled recent sinkholes or to sinkholes developed in an area where the aggradation rate \ncounterbalances the subsidence rate. On the other hand, old buried sinkholes may pose \nsubsidence problems due to differential compaction or reactivation, especially when \nhuman activities involve the application of loads or changes in the natural hydrological \nregime. \n \nTwo types of processes are involved in the generation of collapse, suffosion and \nbending sinkholes: subsurface dissolution (hydrogeological component) and downward \nmovement of the overlying material due to lack of basal support (mechanical \n component). From a practical viewpoint, active dissolution processes in carbonate karst \nareas are relatively slow (Beck 2004) and the effects attributable to dissolution alone \nover a short timescale are relatively uncommon. In contrast, dissolution is very rapid in \nevaporite karst areas, especially those with unsaturated rapid turbulent water flows \nand\/or those areas with salt deposits. It is important to note that subsidence processes \ncan be very rapid and may be related to dissolutional voids generated in the past. This \nmeans that sinkholes may occur in areas over cavernous soluble bedrock where no \nactive dissolution is currently occurring.  \n \nThe main factors that control evaporite karstification process are discussed by Guti\u00e9rrez \nand Guti\u00e9rrez (1998), Klimchouk (2000) and  Jeschke et al. (2001), they include:  \n(1) The composition of the evaporites and any adjacent aquifers (lithology and \nmineralogy).  \n(2) The structure and texture of the soluble rocks and any adjacent aquifers.  \n(3) The amount of water flowing in contact with the evaporites and its physico-\nchemical properties (including saturation index and temperature).  \n(4) The flow regime and groundwater conditions (laminar or turbulent, phreatic or \nvadose).  \n(5) The variations in the water table (or piezometric level).  \n \nThe internal erosion and deformational processes are primarily controlled by different \nfactors (Waltham et al 2005), including:  \n(1) The thickness of the sediments overlying the karstification zone and cavities that \ncan be generated either by dissolution or upward stoping.  \n(2)  The mechanical properties of the covering materials, which may change by \ndissolution processes and variations in the water content.  \n(3) Geometry and size of the subsurface voids; primarily the span of the cavity \nroofs.  \n(4) Position and changes of the water table (or piezometric level). \n \nFrequently, natural or anthropogenic changes in the karst environment can accelerate \nthe processes involved in the generation of sinkholes, favoring or triggering their \noccurrence or reactivation. Sinkholes whose genesis has been favored or determined by \nhuman activities are commonly termed induced sinkholes. According to Waltham et al. \n (2005), the vast majority of the active sinkholes are induced or accelerated by human \nactivity. The main changes and activities that may induce the occurrence of sinkholes \nare listed in Table 1. \n \n Identification of sinkholes and subsidence areas \nThe selection and application of mitigation measures aimed at reducing sinkhole risk \ngenerally requires the recognition of the existing sinkholes (identification) and the \ndelineation of the areas where future new sinkholes are likely to occur (prediction). It is \nalso important to gather information on the size and frequency of the sinkhole events, \nand on the subsidence mechanisms and rates. However, the identification of areas \naffected by evaporite-dissolution subsidence is usually a difficult task (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. \n2007a). Sinkholes are frequently masked by anthropogenic activities, such as filling and \ndevelopment, or natural aggradation or erosion processes may obliterate them. \nCommonly, sinkholes may have a very subtle geomorphic expression or the collapse \ncreated by underground processes may not yet have reached the ground surface. In order \nto partially overcome these difficulties, it is essential to investigate as many sources of \nsurface and subsurface information as possible to provide data about the past and \ncurrent subsidence activity in the study area.  \n \n Surface data \nAerial photographs and satellite images \nAerial photographs, especially large-scale color stereoscopic images, are a very useful \ntool for identifying sinkholes. Their main limitation is that, depending on the scale and \ndefinition of the images, it may not be possible to pinpoint small or shallow sinkholes. \nOld aerial photographs are frequently very helpful for the identification of filled \nsinkholes or those that are now covered by buildings or human structures (Fig. 3). The \ndetailed interpretation of photographs taken on different dates allows the chronology of \nrecently formed sinkholes to be constrained. The interpretations help to obtain \nminimum estimates of the probability of sinkhole occurrence and allow the analysis of \nthe spatio-temporal distribution patterns of the subsidence phenomena. Low sun-angle \nphotographs, with conspicuous shadows can emphasize subtle topographic features \n(McCalpin 1996) and may be practical for the detection of sinkholes with poor \ngeomorphic expression. A complementary technique is the analysis of airborne and \n satellite multispectral and thermal images which may be used to distinguish surface \nterrain patterns and to extract variations in moisture, vegetation, color and temperature \nthat may be related to sinkholes and subsidence areas (e.g. Cooper 1989). \n \nField surveys \nThorough reconnaissance of the ground may locate sinkholes not identifiable on aerial \nphotographs, due to their reduced size, depth or vegetation cover. A database template \nmay be used for the description of each sinkhole (Cooper et al. 2001, Cooper 2008), \nincluding a space for diagrams and entries covering aspects including locality \ncoordinates, geometry, orientation, dimensions, age, relative chronology (cross-cutting \nrelationships, preservation degree, vegetation), signs of instability, proximity to human \nstructures, and other observations. Some features may help to detect shallow subsidence \ndepressions and filled sinkholes. These include anthropogenic fills with subcircular \npatterns, the presence of swampy areas, or the growth of palustrine or halophilous \nvegetation. Commonly, the application of intrusive or non-intrusive techniques, such as \ntrenching, probing, drilling or geophysical surveys, is needed to determine whether \nthese anomalous characteristics correspond to sinkholes. Direct inspections also allow \nthe detection of instability signs, such as cracks, scarps or pipes. These features provide \ninformation on the activity and chronology of the sinkholes and may serve as indicators \nfor anticipating the location of future sinkholes. Sinkhole activity in developed areas \nbecomes apparent through pavement and building deformation, disrupted services and \nother structures. Mapping the subsidence damage, using a damage ranking system such \nas that established by the National Coal Board (N.C.B. 1975), provides information on \nthe spatial distribution of the subsidence, and may help to infer the main natural and \nanthropogenic factors that control the dissolution and subsidence processes (Gutierrez \nand Cooper 2002). Building damage can also be recorded on proforma record sheets to \nprovide the data in a GIS and database-friendly format (Cooper et al. 2001, Cooper \n2008). \n \nTopographic and geodetic information \nThe contour lines of detailed topographic maps may depict subsidence depressions not \ndetectable by means of field surveys and aerial photograph interpretations (Kasting and \nKasting 2003). In some areas, the contour lines and local names on old topographic \nmaps have proved highly valuable for pinpointing sinkholes obliterated by artificial fill \n or development (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2007b) (Fig. 3). Several geodetic techniques, like \nInSAR (Baer et al. 2002; Al Fares 2005), GPS, photogrammetry, and high-resolution \ndigital elevation models (DEMs) such as those produced by LIDAR, may be applied to \nlocate sinkholes and estimate subsidence rates accurate to a few millimeters per year \n(Waltham et al. 2005). GIS techniques, such as applying wide color ramps restricted to \nnarrow elevation ranges on DEM and LIDAR data allow subsidence features and \npatterns to be picked out easily. \n \nOral and documentary information \nIn some regions, information from local residents may substantially improve the \nsinkhole inventory, providing data on the spatial and temporal distribution of undetected \nand filled sinkholes (Cooper, 1986; Beck 1991). It is important to conduct systematic \ninterviews asking for the location of sinkholes, their chronology, and possible \nrelationship with any triggering or conditioning factor, dimensions, morphology, \norientation, subsidence mechanisms, and reactivations. Abundant information is \nfrequently obtained from the people involved in filling the hollows. It must be born in \nmind that some landowners may be reluctant to provide any data on sinkhole \noccurrences, to avoid the depreciation of their property. Additional information from \nwritten documents, such as local newspapers or reports from public institutions and \nprivate companies, may provide information on the characteristics, situation and \nchronology of sinkholes. \n \nPaleokarst features \nPaleosinkholes and subsidence structures exposed in natural and artificial outcrops offer \nvaluable information about sinkhole formation, including where they have occurred in \nthe past and their approximate sizes. They are also important for showing how sinkholes \nwere formed and the subsidence processes that have occurred. Furthermore, they help to \ndefine where sinkholes may occur in the future (Fig. 4). Experience from many areas \ndemonstrates that sinkholes commonly result from the reactivation of pre-existing \ncavities and subsidence structures. These observations indicate that paleosinkholes may \nbe used as a tool for identifying locations highly susceptible to subsidence (Guti\u00e9rrez \n1998; Guerrero et al. 2004) (Fig. 4). Additional information on the chronology and \ndeformational history of subsidence structures can be gained by applying the \n methodologies used for the paleoseismological investigation of faults exposed in \nartificial trenches (McCalpin 1996). \n \nSubsurface data \nSpeleological exploration \nA highly valuable source of information is speleological exploration. Unfortunately it \ncannot be used in many subsidence-prone or phreatic situations. The examination and \nmapping of underground cavities provides data on the distribution of the accessible \nvoids and the location of the points where active undermining processes (stoping, \nsuffosion and bending) affecting the cavity ceilings may create new sinkholes in the \nnear future. These unstable areas are revealed by the presence of collapse chimneys and \nbending structures in the cavity ceilings, and debris cones in the cavity floors produced \nby collapse or suffosion processes (Fig. 5). The fresh or degraded appearance of these \nfeatures may be utilized to assess the relative likelihood of new sinkhole occurrences. \nDetailed maps of gypsum caves in the Western Ukraine (Klimchouk and Andrejchuk \n2005) and in the Ural Region (Andrejchuk and Klimchouk 2002) show the distribution \nof breakdown cupolas and cones. These are probably the most reliable sinkhole \nsusceptibility maps ever produced, even though they identify a process under way rather \nthan a prediction of collapse. \n \nGeophysical prospecting \nGeophysical exploration techniques can be used to detect anomalies and changes in the \nphysical properties of the ground that may correspond to cavities (air-, water-, or \nsediment-filled), subsidence structures (raveling zones, breccia pipes, synclinal sags, \ndownthrown blocks), irregular rockhead topography, or buried sinkholes. In most cases, \nthe characteristics of the anomalies need to be confirmed by intrusive methods such as \nprobing, drilling or trenching. There are a wide variety of methods whose applicability \nand suitability depends largely on the available budget, geological context (bare, \nmantled or interstratal karst, type of surficial deposits), topography, expected type of \ndissolution and subsidence structures, presence of interfering factors such as man-made \nservices, and the required penetration and resolution. A good option is to apply two or \nmore geophysical methods and compare results. Reviews on the geophysical methods \nused in karst areas have been presented by Hoover (2003) and Waltham et al. (2005). \nSome of the main advantages and disadvantages of the methods are presented in Table \n 2. It is advisable to use a phased sequence of investigation using geophysics on sites \nprior to drilling and probing; \u201canomalous\u201d and  \u201cnormal\u201d areas can then be identified \nand targeted for investigation by drilling (Patterson et al. 1995). This approach has \nproved very effective for numerous commercial site investigations in Ripon over the \npast 10 years. \n \nProbing and drilling \nProbing and drilling provide valuable information on the nature and geotechnical \nproperties of the ground and allow the recognition of voids and sediments disturbed by \nsubsidence processes including raveling zones and breccia pipes. These may be seen in \nthe core or located in the borehole by the loss of penetration resistance or drilling fluids. \nHowever, these techniques are expensive and time-consuming have other limitations. \nThe normal site investigation practice of wide-spaced boreholes means that they may \neasily miss cavities, and stoping or raveling structures, consequently, to be certain of \nground conditions,a program of deep and closely spaced borings is required (Cooper \nand Calow 1998). Such an array may not allow the satisfactory identification of bending \nsubsidence structures (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the interpretations derived from borehole \ndata may have a high degree of uncertainty due to the complex, sometimes chaotic, \nunderlying geology in karst areas. Cored drilling is the most satisfactory method, but \nopen hole drilling with expert identification of the chippings samples can be cost-\neffective when combined with detailed records of drilling rates. The creation of cavities \nin highly soluble salts during and after drilling operations may be prevented using \nnearly saturated drilling fluids and casing the boreholes to avoid the circulation of water \nfrom any of the intersected aquifers (Johnson, 1989). It is important that any boreholes \nfor site investigation are properly grouted after use. In gypsum it is important to use a \nsulfate-proof grout and in other evaporites a grout that will perform in the particular \nsaline conditions. If the boreholes are not grouted properly they can become the focus \nfor dissolution and may themselves lead to subsidence events. In the Ukraine a borehole \ndrilled into a cave caused dissolution by aggressive drainage of surface water forming a \npipe several meters across (Alexander Klimchouk, pers. comm.). In Israel, dissolution \nin salt on the site of a borehole to investigate the sinkhole-prone sequence caused a \nsubsidence crater to open up near the Dead Sea (Mark Talesnick pers. comm. 2003). \nDrilling into breccia pipes and unstable ground is potentially hazardous and \n investigation companies should carry out a risk assessment of sites before drilling; \ngeophysical information can help in this respect. \n \nTrenching \nTrenching provides an opportunity for detailed study of the stratigraphy and structure of \nthe deposits, and when complemented with the application of absolute dating \ntechniques, is a very useful methodology for sinkhole investigation in mantled karst \nsettings. This methodology, widely used in paleoseismological (e.g. McCalpin 1996) \nand landslide investigations (e.g. Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2005a), may provide extensive \npractical information about several aspects including (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2007a): (1) The \nnature of geophysical anomalies and topographic depressions that have an uncertain \norigin. (2) The precise limits of filled and poorly-defined sinkholes. (3) The structure of \nthe deposits (synclines, failure planes, raveling zones) and insight into the subsidence \nmechanisms and magnitude (cumulative displacement). (4) Retrodeformation analysis \nof the deposits by means of the progressive restoration of the sedimentary bodies; this \nmay allow the interpretation of multiple subsidence episodes (Figure 6). (5) Absolute \ndating techniques, primarily radiocarbon and luminescence (OSL and TL) methods. \nThese may be used to obtain mean subsidence rates and constrain the timing of the \nsubsidence episodes (Fig. 6). The inferred evolution of particular sinkholes from \ntrenching may be used to forecast their future behavior. Closely allied with trenching \nthe stripping of topsoil or overburden can show the positions of subsidence features on a \nsite during construction. \n \nHydrogeological investigations \nUnderstanding the hydrogeology of the study area is a crucial aspect of sinkhole hazard \nanalysis. The groundwater flow is the geological agent responsible for the karstification \nof evaporite rocks and commonly one of the most important conditioning and triggering \nfactors involved in the generation of sinkholes. Numerous aspects need to be \ninvestigated especially the position of the water table (or piezometric level) and how it \nchanges through time and space, either naturally or by anthropogenic means. It is \nimportant to find out whether the evaporites and the overlying sediments are affected by \na downward vadose flow or by a phreatic\/artesian flow controlled by the piezometric \ngradient. One way this can be done is by a borehole monitoring of groundwater levels \nusing nested piezometers (Lamont-Black et al., 2005). A relevant factor, that may \n significantly influence suffosion processes in mantled karst settings, is the position of \nthe water table with respect to rockhead. The groundwater flow velocity and flow path \nare also important and these may be investigated by means of tracers. The \nhydrochemistry of the groundwater and saturation index with respect to the main \nevaporitic minerals give indications of how aggressive the water is and how fast \ndissolution will proceed. Lastly, the impact of human activities on the natural hydrology \nshould be investigated and recorded.  \n \n Spatial and temporal prediction \nOnce the pre-existing sinkholes and areas affected by subsidence have been identified \nand mapped, the next step in the hazard analysis is to predict the spatial and temporal \ndistribution of future sinkholes. It is important to know where sinkholes will occur in \nthe future, when they will form, with what frequency, how they will develop, what size \nthey will reach and their likely mechanism of collapse. \n \n Temporal prediction \nThe temporal prediction of sinkholes has two facets; one is the anticipation of the \nprecise future moment or time interval when sinkholes will occur, and the other is the \nassessment of their frequency or probability of occurrence. At the present time, it is not \npossible to satisfactorily predict when and where an individual sinkhole will form. \nMonitoring systems like the one recently installed in the Italian village of Camaiore (V. \nBuchignani, pers. comm.) may help. This system provides continuous records of \npotential precursors such as subsurface microdeformation, variations in the water table, \nand subtle changes in the elevation, which may help to anticipate individual collapse \nsinkholes. Another predictive strategy is the use of a good understanding of the \ntemporal patterns of hydrological triggering factors, such as rainstorms, floods or major \nirrigation and water table decline periods. Correlation with these events may be used to \nforecast the times of year that are susceptible to a higher frequency of sinkhole \nformation, such as periods of intense irrigation, flood or rainfall. \n \nThe sinkhole frequency, or probability of occurrence, can be regarded as the number of \nsinkhole events per year per unit area. A probability of occurrence of 0.1 sinkhole\/km2 \nyear means that on average in a 10 km2 area, one sinkhole a year is expected to occur. \n Alternatively, it means that there is a statistical probability of 100% for a sinkhole to \noccur in the area each year (mean annual probability). Chronological information about \nthe sinkhole occurrences (either a precise age or an age range) is strictly necessary to be \nable to estimate temporal frequency values. It is important to note that in areas where no \nchronological data are available, no frequency assessments can be carried out and a \nhigher sinkhole density does not necessarily imply a higher probability of occurrence. \nThe calculation of the probability of occurrence must be based on a sinkhole inventory \nwhich should be as complete as possible covering a representative time period (Beck \n1991). The validity of the obtained frequency will depend on the completeness and \nquality of the available data derived from the different sources of information (reviewed \nin the previous section). In most cases we are not able to identify all the sinkhole events \nthat occurred during the considered time span. Consequently this results in a minimum \nor optimistic sinkhole frequency. In the gypsum karst of Ripon (NE England), there is a \nreasonable record of sinkhole events (Cooper, 1986, 1998) which gives an estimated \nprobability of occurrence of 0.05 major sinkholes\/km2 year based on 6.5 km2 and the \npast 100 years records. Using information from 1980, the time of the resurvey, to 2000 \ngives 21 major events in 20 years over 6.5 km2 equating with 0.17 sinkholes\/km2, or \none every 6 years. The events are clustered in some places, consequently, the likelihood \nof a subsidence happening in these places is greater. These data underline the \nincompleteness of the recorded events and the bias in the historical data towards the \ntime when the survey was undertaken. The data also show a bias to major events, which \nare recorded, while small events are not normally noted. A probability of 44 cover \ncollapse sinkholes\/km2 year has been calculated by Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (2007a) in an \nintensely irrigated terrace of the Ebro River in the NE of Spain. \n \n Spatial prediction \nSeveral strategies may be applied to address the spatial prediction of sinkholes. A \ncommonly used approach is the delineation of the a priori more susceptible areas to \nsinkhole events by an expert, based on geological criteria and the known information on \nthe spatial and temporal distribution of previous sinkholes. Some aspects related to the \nspatial distribution and geometry of the sinkholes may be used to produce or refine the \nsusceptibility maps.  \n \n The clustering or dispersion of sinkholes may be quantified using nearest neighbor \nanalysis (Williams 1972). This analysis may be applied to test whether the generation of \nnew sinkholes is influenced by the location of the pre-existing sinkhole population \n(Kemmerly 1982), and if the sinkhole distribution has any statistical value for the \nprediction of future sinkholes (Hyatt et al. 1999; Guti\u00e9rrez-Santolalla et al. 2005b). If \nthe analysis demonstrates that new sinkholes tend to form in the vicinity of previously \nexisting ones, their surroundings may be considered as especially prone to subsidence. \nIn areas where structurally-controlled sinkholes show preferred alignment and \nelongation trends, the analysis of such orientated data can be undertaken manually by \nplotting lineations though the centers of sinkholes (Cooper 1986) or by computer \nutilizing the Hough Transform method of analysis (Wadge et al. 1993). In these \nsituations the following criteria could be applied for the delineation of susceptibility \nzonations (Guti\u00e9rrez-Santolalla et al. 2005b): (1) The areas next to the extremities of the \nsinkholes defined by the controlling azimuths may be considered as more susceptible \nthan the rest of the sinkhole margins. (2) A higher susceptibility may be attributed to the \nbelts of land between sinkholes aligned in the prevalent direction. A more objective \napproach is the elaboration of susceptibility zonations to analyze the statistical \nrelationships between the known sinkholes (the \u201cdependent\u201d variable) and the available \ninformation on the conditioning factors (the \u201cindependent\u201d variables) using GIS (Galve \net al. 2006) \n \nIt is important to note that the temporal and spatial predictions derived from all these \nmethodologies should be considered as non-corroborated hypotheses. This is because \nthey are derived from a limited amount of data (spatial and temporal distribution of \nsinkholes, and conditioning factors) and the predictions implicitly assume that the \nsubsidence phenomena in the future will have a rate and behavior similar to those in the \npast (Cendrero 2003). This may not be true, and the sinkhole hazard (probability and \nseverity) in the future may be significantly higher, or lower, than it was in the past due \nto anthropogenic or natural changes in the factors that control the dissolution and \nsubsidence processes. For these reasons, the reliability of the predictions should be \nchecked with statistically independent data. The predictive capability of the \nsusceptibility zonations may be evaluated using validation methods such as those used \nto check predictive landslide models (Remondo et al. 2003). Figure 7 shows how the \nvalidation of susceptibility maps with temporal data allows the transformation from \n susceptibility zonations (relative probability) into hazard maps (quantitative \nprobability). \n \nHazard and risk assessment \n \nThe potential annual sinkhole risk in a given area may be estimated using the formula \n(Bell 1999): \nR = \u03a3 H x E x V \nwhere R is the risk, expressed in terms of victims per year or financial losses per year; \nH is the hazard; E the exposure or elements at risk, referring to the population and the \neconomic value of the properties and activities that may be affected by sinkholes; and V \nthe vulnerability, given by the unitary fraction of the exposure that is expected to be \ndamaged if affected by a sinkhole. The total annual risk corresponds to the sum of the \nestimated risk for each exposed human element. Preferably, the hazard should include \ntwo components; the probability of sinkhole occurrence, and the expected severity of \nthe future sinkholes (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2007b). The severity refers to the physical scale of \nthe subsidence processes and sinkholes that determine their capability to cause damage. \nThis is basically the size of the sinkhole at the time of formation and the subsidence \nrate, which depends largely on the subsidence mechanism. In an ideal situation, it would \nbe desirable to produce a scaling relationship between the magnitude and frequency of \nthe sinkholes. This is commonly achieved for other hazardous geological processes \nincluding floods and earthquakes. \n \nThe sinkhole hazard and risk assessment may also be used to perform cost-benefit \nanalysis. This compares the costs over time calculated for the sinkhole-affected project \nusing the \u201cwith mitigation\u201d and \u201cwithout mitigation\u201d scenarios (Cooper and Calow \n1998). This analysis provides quantitative information on several practical aspects for \nthe management of the sinkhole risk. It gives information on the cost-effectiveness of \nparticular mitigation measures for a given period of time and the time period required \nfor a mitigation measure to be paid off. It also identifies the most economically and \nsocially advantageous mitigation measures for the life span of a project. In the situations \nwhere catastrophic sinkholes might endanger human lives, public safety should prevail \n over the economic criteria for the selection of mitigation measures, either preventive or \ncorrective. \n \n Mitigation \nThe safest mitigation strategy is the avoidance of the subsidence features and the areas \nmost susceptible to sinkholes. This preventive measure may be applied prohibiting or \nlimiting development in the most hazardous areas through land use planning and \nregulations (Paukstys et al. 1999; Richardson 2003). The preventive planning is \ncommonly most effective when developed by local administrations (Pauksty et al. \n1999). When sinkhole-prone areas are occupied by people, vulnerable buildings and \ninfrastructure, the risk should be mitigated by reducing the activity and severity of the \nprocesses (hazard), the vulnerability, or both. Since the control of the subsurface \ndissolution and subsidence processes involved in the generation of sinkholes may be \nvery difficult, safe mitigation commonly requires careful planning and the application of \nsubsidence protected engineering designs. A critical design parameter is the maximum \ndiameter of the sinkholes at the time of formation, as it determines the distance that has \nto be spanned to prevent the deformation of the engineered structure. Some corrective \nmeasures aimed at diminishing the activity of the processes (Milanovic 2000) include: \n(1) Preventing water withdrawal and the decline of the water table. (2) Lining of canals \nand ditches. (3) Using flexible pipes with telescopic joints. (4) Controlling irrigation. (5) \nMaking the surface impermeable with geomembranes or geotextiles. (6) Using efficient \ndrainage systems and diverting surface runoff. (7) Remediating sinkholes and clogging \nswallow holes. (8) Filling cavities in the soil or rock by grouting (Sowers 1996). \nHowever, filling cavities may block most of the flow paths concentrating underground \nflow along particular conduits and thus favoring focused dissolution (Cooper 1998). (9) \nImproving the ground by compaction or injection grouting to increase the strength and \nbearing capacity of the soils. (10) Construction of cutoff screens and grout curtains \nbeneath dams to avoid ground water circulation beneath the structures.  \n \nDifferent types of engineering measures have been applied to protect structures from \nsinkhole development. These include: (1) Special foundations for buildings including \nraft or slab, reinforced strip and ring-beam foundations; these are strong foundations \nwhich distribute the load of the structures over large areas. Beam extensions to these \nfoundations, especially at the corners of the structures, can offer more protection and \n prevent a cantilever situation developing on the edges of structures. Skin friction and \nend-bearing piles are commonly used to transfer the structural load to the soil cover or \nsolid bedrock, respectively (Reuter and Tolma\u0000\u039dv, 1990; Reuter and Stoyan, 1993; \nCooper and Calow 1998; Waltham et al. 2005). (2) Linear infrastructures including \nroads and railways can be reinforced by incorporating tensile geogrids in the sub-base \nand embankments. This technique prevents catastrophic collapse, and can sag to act as a \nwarning mechanism that collapse is occurring before it becomes a catastrophic failure; \nmeasures can then be taken to remediate the problem (Cooper and Saunders 2002). (3) \nRigid structures like reinforced concrete slabs acting as ground bridges have been \nproposed to protect high-speed railways that cannot tolerate even slight settlement. An \nadded degree of security could be gained by piling the slabs (Guerrero et al. 2004). (4) \nSinkhole-resistant bridges can be built incorporating oversized foundation pads to the \npiers and a sacrificial pier design, so that the structure will withstand the loss of a pier \n(Cooper and Saunders 2002). Other non-structural measures aimed at reducing the \nfinancial losses and harm to people include: (1) Insurance policies to spread the cost \ngenerated by sinkholes among the people at risk. (2) Monitoring in problematical \nlocations with highly vulnerable structures - where the settlement of the ground and the \ndeformation of the structures can be instrumented with monitoring and warning systems \n(inclinometers, extensometers, geodetic measurements, laser or light transmitters and \nreceptors). (3) Educational programs oriented to adequate the perception of the hazard \namong the public and decision makers to the objective likelihood of sinkhole \noccurrence (Buskirk et al 1999). (4) The fencing and warning signposting of sinkholes \nand sinkhole-prone areas. \n \n Conclusions \nSinkholes in evaporite karst areas are in general more active and diverse in character \nthan sinkholes developed in carbonate karst terrains. The differences are mainly because \nevaporites have a higher solubility, lower mechanical strength and some also have a \nmore ductile rheology than the carbonate rocks. Two main situations for sinkhole \ndevelopment occur. At the surface, solution sinkholes form by corrosional lowering. \nSubsurface dissolution and the downward movement of overlying materials produce the \nsecond type, which are the most important from a ground instability and engineering \nperspective. The main subsidence mechanisms that form sinkholes include: collapse of \n soil or rock cavity roofs; downward migration of unconsolidated deposits through \ndissolutional voids (suffosion); and passive bending caused by progressive interstratal \nkarstification or the differential lowering of the rockhead. Sinkholes caused by the \ndissolution of evaporites have a substantial detrimental effect in many regions of the \nWorld. The generation of sinkholes may cause severe damage to man-made structures \nand may threaten human lives when they occur in a catastrophic way. The selection and \napplication of sinkhole mitigation measures should be based on sound hazard and risk \nassessments. The hazard assessment involves the identification and characterization of \nthe existing sinkholes and karst features and the prediction of future subsidence \nphenomena. These include the areas where new sinkholes are more likely to occur, the \nprobability of sinkhole formation, the expected subsidence mechanism and maximum \ninitial size of the sinkholes (severity).  \n \nThe recognition of sinkholes is frequently a difficult task that should be addressed by \nexploring as many sources of surface and subsurface information as possible. Surface \ndata may be obtained from aerial photographs and satellite images, field surveys, \nbuilding-damage maps, historical and recent topographical maps, accounts from local \npeople, historical documents, exposed dissolution and subsidence features (paleokarst), \nand high resolution geodetic techniques (InSAR, photogrammetry, LIDAR and DEMs). \nThe main sources of subsurface data are derived from speleological exploration, \ngeophysical surveys, boreholes, trenching complemented with absolute dating \ntechniques, and hydrogeological investigations. The reliability of future sinkhole \nprediction will depend largely on the completeness of the sinkhole\/karst inventory and \nan understanding of the local geology and hydrogeology. Chronological information \nabout past sinkhole events, either as a date or an age range, is indispensable for \nestimating a minimum probability of sinkhole occurrence (number of sinkholes\/km2 \nyear). Although it is not currently possible to anticipate the precise location and timing \nof individual sinkholes, the installation of monitoring systems that provide a continuous \nrecord of potential precursors (microdeformations, surface deformations, changes in the \nwater table etc.), might yield good results in the future.  \n \nSinkhole susceptibility zonations (relative probability) may be produced. These should \nbe based on a good knowledge of the geology, the spatial and temporal distribution of \npre-existing sinkholes and other karst features (karst inventory) and spatial distribution \n analysis techniques (including preferential elongation and alignment, nearest neighbor \nanalysis). More objective susceptibility models may be obtained by analyzing the \nstatistical relationships between the known sinkholes and the conditioning factors. All \nthese predictions are based on the underlying assumption that sinkhole activity in the \nfuture will have a behavior similar to that of the past. The predictions are commonly \nderived from incomplete records and should be considered as non-corroborated \nhypotheses. Temporal validation techniques may be applied to assess the predictive \ncapability of the susceptibility maps and transform them into probability maps. \nQuantitative sinkhole hazard assessment (probability and severity) allows us to assess \nthe potential damage that may be caused by sinkholes (risk) and to perform cost-benefit \nanalyses. Avoidance of areas most susceptible to sinkhole activity is the safest \nmitigation strategy. In sinkhole-prone areas, it is difficult to control subsurface \ndissolution and associated sinkhole subsidence processes, consequently, safe \ndevelopment requires the application of subsidence-proof engineering designs.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements This work has been partially co-financed by the Spanish Education \nand Science Ministry and the FEDER (project CGL2004-02892\/BTE).
