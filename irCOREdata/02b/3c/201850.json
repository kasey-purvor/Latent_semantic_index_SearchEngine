The study finds that a democratic regime, a left-wing oriented \ngovernment, regional peer influence and a high level of economic \ndevelopment speed up ratification. A legal system built on common law and, if \nless robustly, ethnic fractionalization lower the likelihood of ratification. \nThese results are compared to the determinants of domestic death penalty \nabolition. Besides similarities, one striking difference is that Eastern \nEuropean country membership in the Council of Europe has been important \nfor domestic abolition, but has had no influence on ratification of the Second \nOptional Protocol. Western European countries exerted pressure on Eastern \nEuropean countries to abolish the death penalty, but did not extend their \npressure towards a ratification of the Second Protocol. Also, whereas \neconomic development does not matter for domestic abolition, an \ninternationally binding commitment to abolition becomes more likely the \nricher the country. \n \nKeywords: Death penalty, capital punishment, abolition, international treaty, ratification \n 2 \nThe continued existence of the death penalty in many countries of the world is highly \ncontentious. It creates conflict and tensions between abolitionist countries and those retaining \nthe death penalty (so-called retentionists). Governments of abolitionist countries routinely \nintervene if one of their citizens is threatened to become executed in a foreign country. Truly \ncommitted abolitionists believe that the death penalty violates basic human rights and are \ntherefore not content with abolishing the penalty within their own jurisdiction only. Instead, \nthey try to persuade and sometimes pressure retentionist countries into joining the abolitionist \ncamp. This article examines what factors prompt countries to ratify or accede to the only \ninternational treaty aimed at the abolition of the death penalty that is not restricted to a \nparticular region.1 This universal treaty is the Second Optional Protocol to the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty \n(hereafter: Second Protocol). It has been adopted with resolution 44\/128 by the United \nNations General Assembly as of 15 December 1989.  \nThe Second Protocol represents a milestone for the international abolitionist movement. \nThe UN had passed resolutions on the use of the death penalty as early as 1959.2 The \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights from 1966 itself requires its State Parties \nto restrict the death penalty to \u2018the most serious crimes in accordance with the law\u2019 (Article \n6.2). It also sets up a number of safeguards for those facing the death penalty, which have \nbeen re-iterated and later on extended by (non-binding) UN resolutions. From the 1970s \nonwards the Secretary-General provided quinquennial reports on the use of the death penalty \nand in 1977 a resolution called for a restriction of the number of offences that could lead to \ncapital punishment \u2018with a view to the desirability of abolishing the punishment\u2019.3 But the \nSecond Protocol remains to date the most important and substantive achievement of \nabolitionist countries. In particular, it is the only universal international treaty that requires \nabolition of the death penalty.4 \n 3 \nThis article is structured as follows: The next section clarifies the relationship between \ndomestic death penalty abolition and ratification of the Second Optional Protocol, arguing \nthat ratification is the more far-reaching decision. We then discuss which factors are \nsuggested by theory as determinants of ratifying this Protocol, focusing on political factors, \nwhich we argue to be more important than cultural, legal or social factors. This is followed by \na presentation of the research design and the results of the empirical estimations, the \nimplications of which are discussed in the final, concluding section. \n \nDEATH PENALTY ABOLITION AND THE SECOND PROTOCOL \nEric Neumayer has provided an analysis of the political foundations underlying the global \ntrend toward domestic death penalty abolition for all crimes as well as for ordinary crimes \nonly in a cross-national sample over the period 1950 to 2001.5 (Countries abolitionist for \nordinary crimes only allow the death penalty for exceptional crimes such as crimes \ncommitted during times of war or crimes committed in exceptional circumstances.) He argues \nthat the major determinants are political in the form of democracy, partisan and regional peer \npressure effects. Article 1 of the Second Protocol requires State Parties not to execute \nanybody and to undertake \u2018all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its \njurisdiction\u2019 (Art. 1.2). So why study ratification of the Second Protocol at all then? Is it not \nsimply synomymous to looking at domestic abolition of the death penalty? \nTo start with, by far not all abolitionist countries are also state parties to the Second \nProtocol. In addition, there are at least three substantive reasons why an analysis of the \ndeterminants of Second Protocol ratification provides additional insight to analyzing the \ndeterminants of death penalty abolition within countries. First, the Second Protocol requires \nState Parties to undertake more ambitious and comprehensive measures than mere abolition. \nWhilst the Second Protocol allows \u2018the application of the death penalty in time of war \n 4 \npursuant to a conviction for a most serious crime of a military nature committed during \nwartime\u2019 (Art. 2.1), such a reservation to the abolition clause in Article 1 is only admissible if \nit is made at the time of ratification or accession. In other words, countries that are \nabolitionist for ordinary crimes, but not State Parties, can change their legislation at any time \nto extend the scope of crimes considered punishable by death. Indeed, in principle they could \neven re-introduce the death penalty, even though in reality this is rarely done.6 State Parties \ncannot revert to or extend the scope of crimes considered punishable from the time of \nratification onwards. Furthermore, a State Party making such a reservation must \ncommunicate to the Secretary-General of the UN the relevant legislative provisions \napplicable during wartime (Art. 2.2) and must notify the Secretary-General of any beginning \nor ending of a state of war (Art. 2.3). Countries, which have merely abolished the death \npenalty for ordinary crimes, but are not State Parties to the Second Protocol, are not subjected \nto any such restrictions. The Second Protocol therefore commits State Parties to a more \nrestrictive application of the death penalty in times of war. \nSecond, the Second Protocol opens the way to independent and international supervision \nof whether formally abolitionist countries actually comply with their commitment of \nabolition. Article 3 requires State Parties to report to the UN\u2019s Human Rights Committee \ncompliance measures undertaken that give effect to the Protocol. In case of non-fulfillment of \nits obligations, other State Parties (Article 4) as well as individuals subject to its jurisdiction \n(Article 5) can complain to the said Committee, which will consider such communication.7 \nThird, in ratifying the Second Protocol, the State Parties make it clear that in their view \nthe abolition of the death penalty is a necessary consequence of respect for basic human \nrights and that the continued existence of the penalty in retentionist countries therefore cannot \nbe regarded as an internal domestic affair. The Preamble to the Second Protocol expresses the \nbelief of State Parties that \u2018abolition of the death penalty contributes to enhancement of \n 5 \nhuman dignity and progressive development of human rights\u2019 with all measures of abolition \nto be considered as \u2018progress in the enjoyment of the right to life\u2019. Most importantly, it \ndeclares that the State Parties undertake \u2018an international commitment to abolish the death \npenalty\u2019 (emphasis added). Even though no specific measures are required from State Parties \nto persuade retentionist countries against capital punishment, it is clear that countries go \nbeyond the mere domestic abolition of the death penalty in becoming State Parties to the \nSecond Protocol. Indeed, this is why attempts by Italy and the Nordic countries in 1994 as \nwell as the EU in 1999 to pass a UN resolution calling upon states to ratify the Second \nOptional Protocol were met with fierce resistance by retentionists and were unsuccessful.8 \nPresumably, for these three reasons there are a great many abolitionist countries that are \nnot State Parties to the Second Protocol, even though there are more abolitionist State Parties \n(54) than abolitionist non-State Parties (38). Table 1 provides a list of countries that are \nregarded as abolitionist for all crimes or at least abolitionist for ordinary crimes only by \namnesty international together with information on whether and when they have ratified the \nSecond Protocol.9 \n \n< Insert Table 1 about here > \n \nPOLITICAL FOUNDATIONS OF SECOND PROTOCOL RATIFICATION \nIn this section, we look at which political factors theory would suggest as likely determinants \nof Second Protocol ratification. We start with international relations theories that focus on \nhow external factors persuade or pressure countries to ratify. We then move on to theories \nthat focus on internal or domestic factors, particularly theories of regime type (democracy vs. \nautocracy and the type and length of democratic regime) and partisan theories.  \n 6 \nFrom a (neo-)realist perspective, powerful countries ratify international treaties and \npressure less powerful countries into doing the same if this is in their perceived interest. \nPower is often approximated by population size and per capita income10 and much evidence \nsuggests that more populous and more developed countries are more active members of the \nworld system in that they negotiate, sign and ratify more international treaties in many areas \nof international co-operation than smaller and\/or poorer countries, for example, in the area of \nenvironment11, monetary affairs12 and women\u2019s rights13. However, the question is whether \nmore powerful countries regard an international protocol aimed at the abolition of the death \npenalty to be in their own interest. With respect to the Second Protocol, the problem is that \nthe United States (US), the most powerful country in the world, is divided into states that are \nretentionist and states that are abolitionist, with the retentionist states vastly outnumbering the \nabolitionist ones. No initiative can therefore be expected from the US. Japan, India and China \nare also retentionist. Western Europe, however, is totally abolitionist and has officially \ndeclared that it is \u2018opposed to the death penalty in all cases and accordingly aims at its \nuniversal abolition\u2019.14 Its 1998 Guidelines to EU Policy Towards Third Countries on the \nDeath Penalty explicitly states that it \u2018has now moved beyond\u2019 abolition within its own \npolitical jurisdiction and \u2018espouses abolition for itself and others\u2019.15 This fits well into a \nrealist account where powerful countries persuade or coerce weaker states into accepting \ninternational treaties that enshrine the powerful countries\u2019 own norms. The good news to \npowerful countries is that shirking is hardly possible when it comes to the Second Protocol. It \nis relatively easily observable whether or not a country applies the death penalty and there is \nnot much room for dispute over its application. This makes the Second Protocol different \nfrom human rights treaties where the abuse of human rights is more difficult to prove. Oona \nHathaway argues that many countries ratify human rights treaties to deflect and disperse \ncriticism of their human rights record.16 Stephen Krasner calls such behavior formal, but not \n 7 \nactual, endorsement of \u2018the script of modernity\u2019.17 However, this strategy cannot work with \nthe Second Protocol as violation of the rule of abolition is easy to monitor. \nIt is well documented that Western European countries have exerted pressure on Eastern \nEuropean countries to abolish the death penalty.18 Abolition of the death penalty has been an \nimportant criterion for membership in the Council of Europe in the early 1990s and was made \na formal requirement for entry in 1996. Eastern European countries considered membership \nin the Council of Europe as one foot in the door towards eventual desired membership in the \nEuropean Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and were willing to \nsuccumb to the pressure from Western European countries and abolish the death penalty, \noften against the expressed will of a majority of citizens. The question is: Did Western \nEuropean countries extend their pressure on Eastern European countries to become State \nParties to the Second Protocol as well or were they already satisfied if these countries \nabolished the penalty domestically? \nAnother theory of international relations called \u2018external socialization\u2019 argues that \ncountries are likely to be influenced by the decisions of their regional peers with regards to \nwhether to ratify an international treaty.19 If many countries within a region have ratified the \nSecond Protocol, pressure mounts on the remaining ones to follow suit. Conversely, if few \ncountries within a region have ratified the treaty, opponents of ratification will find it easier \nto defend their position and to reject criticism from home and abroad. It need not be pressure \nthat matters as a realist account would suggest, however, but norm diffusion within regions \nsharing similar political cultures and histories can take place without any form of coercion \ninvolved.20 Such regional policy contagion dynamics working via communication, learning, \nimitation and altered reputational payoffs are well established in the literature on the \ndiffusion of economic policies21 and have been documented for the ratification of human \nrights treaties22 and the acceptance of the authority of the international criminal court23. \n 8 \nMoving from theories that focus on external factors to theories focusing on internal or \ndomestic factors instead, many abolitionists argue that the institution of the death penalty \nviolates fundamental human rights. For example, the EU sees the death penalty as a \u2018denial of \nhuman dignity\u2019 and holds \u2018that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to (\u2026) the \nprogressive development of human rights\u2019.24 From this perspective, abolition of the death \npenalty is the logical result of a process of humanizing the penal system \u2013 either in its benign \nversion forming part of a process of civilization and modernization analyzed by Elias25 or in \nits less benign Foucaultian26 version contributing to the sophistication of power and control \nas the penal system moves from violent punishment in the open to penitentiary correction \nbehind closed prison doors. \nIf the severity of punishment is a human rights issue then democracies can also be \nexpected to be more willing to abolish the death penalty than autocracies. This is because \ndemocracies, almost by definition, are more willing to accept constitutional limits on \ngovernmental power and there is evidence that they respect better the human rights of their \ncitizens.27 Along the same line of reasoning, it is not surprising that, with the exception of the \nUnited States, the countries making the most vigorous use of the death penalty are \ndictatorships. Robert Burt provides a different argument on the link between democracy and \nabolition when he maintains that the \u2018democratic principle, properly understood, is inherently \ninconsistent with the practice\u2019 of capital punishment since the death penalty rejects the \ndemocratic principle of equal citizenship and the (theoretical) possibility of reconciliation \namong adversaries.28 Corey Brettschneider similarly argues that the death penalty violates \nhuman dignity derived from free and equal citizenship in a democratic regime.29 Another \nreason why democracy might have a positive impact upon abolition is that the alleged \ndeterrent effect of the death penalty is arguably strongest if the penalty is mandatory and \napplied without exception for certain types of crimes. Roger Hood argues that this \u2018is not an \n 9 \noption for democratic states bound by the rule of law and concern for humanity and respect \nfor human rights\u2019.30 Austin Sarat pushes this argument further in expressing his concern that \nthe practice of capital punishment undermines the legal values and the institutions constituent \nof democracy.31 \nA caveat to keep in mind concerning the positive effect of democracy on abolition is that \nleadership by the political elite is important since in many countries abolition has been \nachieved against the majority opinion of the people.32 This also suggests that any positive \nlink between democracy and abolition is not caused by the fact that democracies are more \naccountable to the will of the people. Rather, what matters is that most democracies might \ngrant inviolable rights to individuals, even if they are criminals. Jack Donnelly warns, \nhowever, that not all democracies are necessarily respectful of human rights.33 The simple \nfact of electoral competition and democratic participation need not coincide with human \nrights protection. He argues that it is \u201cliberal democracy\u201d rather than democracy per se that \nmatters, i.e. \u2018a very specific kind of government in which the morally and politically prior \nrights of citizens and the requirement of the rule of law limit the range of democratic \ndecision-making\u2019.34 The unique character of state-determined criminal law and substantial \nlaymen participation and influence on the extent of punitiveness of the criminal sanction \nsystem, which stir populist and demagogic penal policies, might provide hints why many \nstates in the US maintain the death penalty and execute a great number of people.35 And yet, \nif we follow Foucault36 and take the employed penal technology itself seriously, then the \ntrend towards more \u201chumane\u201d, \u201ccivilized\u201d and \u201cphysically painless\u201d executions in the US and \nother retentionist democracies might signal that in these countries even advocates of the death \npenalty understand that there is a fundamental conflict between capital punishment and the \nhuman rights and dignity typically afforded to citizens in democracies. \n 10 \nNone of these arguments so far suggest, however, that democracies would want to go \nbeyond domestic abolition. Such an argument can be derived from a liberal perspective \nthough. From this perspective, a country\u2019s willingness to ratify an international treaty is \npredominantly influenced by domestic politics. Domestic groups with an interest in death \npenalty abolition, be they non-governmental organizations, protest movements, political \nparties or any other group, pressure their domestic government into the ratification of human \nrights regimes.37 Obviously, there is more leeway for such pressure where the domestic \npolitical regime allows opposition and the exertion of peaceful political pressure on the \ngovernment. Democracies are also more willing to accept limits on governmental power and \ndiscretion imposed by binding international treaties. \nAndrew Moravcsik argues, however, that not all democracies share the same willingness \nto accept legally binding international obligations.38 Recognising that ratification of an \ninternational treaty brings with it some constraint on domestic sovereignty, he argues that this \ncost needs to be balanced against the benefits of ratification, which comes from binding \nfuture policy makers to the current decision. Such self-binding can be beneficial if the current \ngovernment wants to prevent future governments to revert to the death penalty again. He \ncontends that newly established democracies have a much larger incentive to accept such \nconstraints as policy makers regard the imposition of external constraints as a means for \nstabilising the recently established democracy and for dispersing domestic political \nuncertainty. An institutionalist international relations perspective would stress, however, that \nthere are many more benefits from international treaties than merely self-binding, which help \ncountries to reap the mutual, often long-term benefits of co-operation. For example, \ninternational human rights treaties provide a common human rights language, reinforce the \nuniversality of human rights, signal a consensus of the international community, create \nstigma for offenders, provide support to human rights campaigners and the like.39 From this \n 11 \nperspective, it seems more likely that the older and well established democracies with a \nlonger tradition of human rights protection are more willing to forego national sovereignty in \norder to bring their long-cherished normative ideal to international recognition. \nInternational treaties are typically ratified by national parliaments, but governments need \nto sign them first. Countries with left-wing governments might be more likely to ratify the \nSecond Protocol than countries with right-wing governments since left-wing politicians are \nless likely to subscribe to arguments of deterrence and retribution typically used to justify \ncapital punishment.40 Some studies show that partisanship does indeed have an impact upon \npenal policies.41 In addition, left-wing governments often have a more internationalist \norientation, which makes them more willing to commit to binding international treaties.42 \nTodd Landman shows that countries ruled by leftist governments are more likely to ratify \ninternational human rights treaties and the death penalty issue is regarded as a human rights \nissue by abolitionists, even if this is contested by rententionists.43 Part of the reason for this \npartisan effect could be similar to the logic advanced by Moravscik44, namely to lock the \ncountry into the policy preferences of the current left-wing government. Jon C. Pennington \nargues that left-wing governments in English-speaking countries outside the US have often \ninitiated a moratorium on the death penalty and have, after leaving office, obstructed attempts \nby right-wing parties to re-install the use of the death penalty.45 Ratification of an \ninternational treaty abolishing the death penalty would be even more effective than a \ntemporary moratorium. \nA final political dimension is suggested by the fact that many countries maintain, for \nsome time at least, the death penalty for offences committed during wartime even if they have \nabolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes. Quite a few countries have been much more \nhesitant to abolish the death penalty for all crimes than for ordinary crimes only. For \nexample, Portugal and the Netherlands abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes in \n 12 \n1867 and 1870, but for all crimes only in 1976 and 1982, respectively. Countries, which have \nexperienced a longer history of warfare are likely to be more reluctant to abolish the death \npenalty for all crimes.46 Conversely, in countries, which have a long history of peace and are \nnot likely to face war in the future, it makes less sense to retain the death penalty for treason \nand similar offences. However, since the Second Optional Protocol allows retention of the \ndeath penalty in time of war, admittedly with restrictions, political violent conflict need not \nhave any impact on countries\u2019 willingness to ratify the Protocol. \n \nOTHER DETERMINANTS OF SECOND PROTOCOL RATIFICATION \nOf course, political factors are not the only determinants of Second Protocol ratification. \nCulture and legal tradition as well as social factors can also have an effect on countries\u2019 \nwillingness to accept international commitments in general and commitments to abolish the \ndeath penalty in particular. In the discussions leading up to the conclusion of the Second \nProtocol, Pakistan maintained that abolition of the death penalty was not consistent with \nIslamic law.47 Many Islamic countries voted against a resolution calling for the drafting of the \nSecond Protocol, citing the conformity of capital punishment with Islamic law as \njustification.48 The same happened when it came to a vote on the actual resolution passing the \nSecond Protocol in the General Assembly.49 The Sudanese representative to the UN stated in \n1994: \u2018Capital punishment is a divine right of some religions. It is embodied in Islam and \nthese views must be respected\u2019.50 One would therefore expect countries with a predominantly \nMuslim population not to ratify the Second Protocol. However, looking at table 1 reveals that \nfour such countries have so far ratified it, namely Azerbeijan in 1999, Turkmenistan in 2000, \nBosnia and Herzegovina in 2001 and Djibouti in 2002. Still, the vast majority of Muslim \ncountries are not State Parties. \n 13 \nBritain in the 19th century was a staunch believer in the death penalty with a high \nexecution rate well above that of continental European countries.51 With the spread of the \nBritish empire the common law legal system and the death penalty came to be applied in its \ncolonies. Such legal and penal traditions can impact upon what are regarded as culturally and \nsocially acceptable forms of punishment. Many common law Caribbean countries in \nparticular are outspoken defenders of the death penalty. In common law \u2018the customs of the \npeople provide the original source of the law\u201952, rather than the decisions of rulers and \nlegislators. Many important legal decisions are set by judiciary precedent and interpretation \nof the law by the court. Legally binding international commitments essentially bypass the \nevolutionary emergence and development of common law. In contrast, civil law countries \nfind it relatively easy to incorporate rules from international treaties into their codified legal \nsystem. This might suggest that common law countries are more reluctant to accept legally \nbinding rules imposed via internationally binding obligations and in combination with the \nlong retentionist tradition of many common law countries would lead one to expect that they \nare less likely to ratify the Second Protocol.  \nSome suggest that the death penalty is employed as an instrument of social control over \nethnic minorities and the perceived threat emanating from them.53 The death penalty can be \nused as a demonstration of the ultimate power of the state over the life of its citizens and \nethnic divisions prompt politicians to take a tough stance on crime. Evidence suggests that \ncities, metros and counties in the US spend more on police and less on productive public \nexpenditures if they are more ethnically diverse.54 The conflict study literature suggests that \nethnically more diverse societies lack social cohesion and might experience more violence \nand conflict.55 One would therefore expect that such countries are less likely to commit to \ninternationally binding rules banning the death penalty and thus taking away the most \npowerful sanction available to keep ethnic minorities in check. \n 14 \n \nRESEARCH DESIGN \nThere are basically two approaches for examining the determinants of Second Protocol \nratification. One is to simply look at whether a country has ratified the Protocol or not. In this \ncase, the dependent variable is a dichotomous one, for which estimation techniques such as \nprobit or logit are most suitable. The other approach is to look at the speed by which \ncountries ratify the Second Protocol, if at all. The dependent variable in this case is therefore \na continuous time variable. One possible estimation technique for this method is the Cox \nproportional hazards model, also known as a survival model.56 It assumes that there is a time-\nvariant underlying base hazard of ratification at any point of time that depends on unobserved \nvariables, possibly in a complex way. Observed control variables increase or lower this base \nhazard by a constant proportional amount. The proportionality assumption is critical, but its \nvalidity can be tested. More formally, let \u03c1(t) be the probability of ratification at time t; this is \nthe hazard of ratification. Denoting \u03c10(t) the exogenous baseline hazard, which reflects those \ntime-dependent factors affecting \u03c1(t) that are common to all countries, the Cox proportional \nhazard model assumes that \n \n\u03c1(t) = \u03c10(t)exp(\u03b2Tx(t)),      (1) \n \nwhere x(t) is a vector of covariates shifting the baseline hazard, and \u03b2T is a vector of \nparameters to be estimated. Countries become \u201cat risk\u201d of ratification in 1990, the year the \nSecond Protocol became open to ratification, or the year of their national independence, if \nlater. A maximum likelihood estimation is carried out, where the likelihood function is \nconstructed using the observation that the probability that country i ratifies at time ti equals \n 15 \n\u2211\u2211\n\u2265\u2265\n==\nijij ttj\nij\nT\nii\nT\nttj\nij\nii\nii\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n||\n))(exp(\n))(exp(\n)(\n)()(\u02c6\nx\u03b2\nx\u03b2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c1 .    (2) \n \nThe likelihood function to be maximized with respect to the vector \u03b2T is then simply \n\u220f\nit\nii t )(\u03c1\u02c6 . \nBoth approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The first approach \nis conceptually clear: a country either ratifies the Second Protocol or not. Also, probit and \nlogit are widely used estimation techniques familiar to most social scientists. The second \nmethod is conceptually somewhat less clear. Early ratification demonstrates a great \ncommitment to the cause. Indeed, it is typically only after a minimum number of countries \nhave ratified a treaty that it comes into force. For example, Article 8:1 of the Second Protocol \nspecifies that it enters into force three months after ten countries have notified to the \nSecretary-General of the UN their ratification of the treaty or their accession to it.57 However, \nwhile early ratification shows commitment, a delay in ratification can be caused by many \nfactors other than lack of commitment. For example, some countries might find it difficult to \nachieve early ratification due to the peculiarities of their political system. The great advantage \nof the second approach is that it allows for greater variation among countries since the \ndependent variable is not simply a dichotomous one. Indeed, the introduction of a time \ndimension allows us to test for the external socialization theory of regional norm diffusion \nover time. For these reasons we prefer the second approach.  \nThe dependent variable is set to zero until the year a country ratifies or otherwise accedes \nto the Protocol, after which it drops out of the sample. Time is measured in discrete rather \nthan continuous time since the explanatory variables are only available in discrete annual \nform.58 The period of study ends in 2002. Of course, the Second Protocol is still open to \nratification and accession, which Paraguay and Timor-Leste have done in 2003 and Estonia, \n 16 \nCzech Republic and San Marino have done in 2004, but 2002 represents the end of our study \nperiod due to lack of data for the explanatory variables. \nWith respect to the explanatory variables, we measure power by the log of population size \nand by the level of economic development as approximated by the log of per capita income.59 \nAs a crude proxy for the difficult to measure pressure that Western European countries might \nhave exerted on Eastern European countries, a dummy variable was set to one for the years in \nwhich an Eastern European country has been a member of the Council of Europe.60 The \naverage share of countries within a region that have ratified the Second Protocol in the \nprevious year is supposed to capture regional diffusion effects. The regions follow the \nboundaries of the three existing regional human rights regimes, which exist in the Americas, \nin Africa and Europe including Russia and the Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan \nand Georgia. The two remaining regions have no regional regimes, namely the Middle East \nand Asia. The regional diffusion variable is not without problems, however. In effect, it \nintroduces a spatial lag into the model and often captures variables omitted from the model.61 \nWe believe our model is relatively comprehensive, but it would be difficult to say with \nconfidence that there are no omitted variables. For this reason, we only include the regional \ndiffusion variable in additional estimations. \nThe Polity IV project provides the most commonly used measure of democracy in \npolitical science.62 The data are derived from expert judgment on aspects of institutionalized \ndemocracy and autocracy within a country, both measured on an additive 0 to 10 scale. The \nautocracy score is deducted from the democracy score to create a variable that runs from \u201310 \nto 10. In most regressions, we will use data from the competing Freedom House measure, \nhowever.63 This is for two reasons: First, Freedom House data are available for more \ncountries than the Polity data, which are typically restricted to countries with a population \nsize of more than one million. Second, the Freedom House measure is closer to the \u201cliberal \n 17 \ndemocracy\u201d ideal, which Donnelly64 argues to be important for human rights protection, \nwhereas the Polity measure refers more to electoral competition and democratic decision-\nmaking, which are procedural characteristics of democracy. Freedom House provides two \nindices based on surveys among experts assessing the extent to which a country effectively \nrespects political rights and civil liberties, both measured on a 1 (best) to 7 (worst) scale. \nPolitical rights refer to, for example, the existence and fairness of elections, existence of \nopposition and the possibility to take over power via elections. Civil rights typically refer to \nsuch rights as the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and association and the \nfreedom of religious expression. A combined freedom index was constructed by adding the \ntwo indices and reverting the index, such that it ranges from 2 (least democratic) to 14 (most \ndemocratic). There is one exception to our rule of generally using the Freedom House \nmeasure, however. In one regression, we enter the number of years a country has been an \nestablished democracy as an explanatory variable. For this, we resort to the Polity measure \nsince it goes back to 1800 and therefore goes back much further in time than the Freedom \nHouse data, which only start in 1972. \nTo test for partisan effects, we use a dummy variable that is set to one if the chief \nexecutive\u2019s party is considered as left-wing (mainly communist, socialist and social \ndemocratic parties) by our source.65 Unfortunately, this variable is only available until 2000. \nTo test the impact of historical experience with armed political conflict on Second Optional \nProtocol ratification we use data from the Uppsala Project.66 Our variable measures the \nnumber of years that have passed since the last incident of an armed political conflict with at \nleast 25 casualties. In sensitivity analysis we found that it makes no difference to the results \nreported below if we separate peace years since last civil war from peace years since last \ninter-state war events or account for the intensity of the last conflict. \n 18 \nWe use a dummy variable for countries considered to have a predominantly Muslim \npopulation67, and another one for countries whose legal system is based on English common \nlaw.68 Finally, our measure of ethnic fractionalization is provided by Tatu Vanhanen.69 He \ndistinguishes three types of ethnic groups, namely groups based on, first, racial differences, \nsecond, linguistic, national or tribal differences and, third, religious differences. Vanhanen \ntakes 100 minus the percentage of the largest group in each type of ethnic group as a proxy \nfor fractionalization in each group and then sums the resulting percentages across all three \ngroups to arrive at the aggregate measure of fractionalization. \nTable 2 reports descriptive statistics for the variables together with a bivariate correlation \nmatrix. \n \n< Insert Table 2 about here > \n \nRESULTS \nTable 3 reports results for the Cox proportional hazard model with ratification delay as the \ndependent variable. All estimations are based on a robust variance estimator and observations \nare assumed to be clustered, that is, are assumed to be independent only across countries, but \nare allowed to be correlated within countries over time. Since the same set of countries \nappear repeatedly over time in the sample, a failure to take clustering into account would \nunder-estimate standard errors. Note that the reported results are hazard ratios, which cannot \nbecome negative. A hazard ratio lower than one signals that an increase in the variable lowers \nthe hazard of ratification, whereas a hazard ratio greater than one means that an increase in \nthe variable raises the hazard of ratification.70 The proportional hazards assumption \nunderlying the Cox estimator can be statistically tested with the help of Schoenfeld residuals. \n 19 \nSuch tests fail to reject the assumption at the 10 per cent significance level throughout. This \nsuggests that the Cox estimator reports valid results. \nWe start with a regression in column I of table 3, in which only the Muslim, common law \nand Council of Europe membership dummies together with population size, democracy, the \nnumber of peace years and the measure of ethnic fractionalization are entered. This \nregression can draw on the greatest sample size. As expected, countries with a legal system \nbuilt on English common law and ethnically more fractionalized countries are less likely, \nwhereas more democratic countries are more likely to have ratified the Second Protocol \n(early on). The coefficients of the Council of Europe membership and the Muslim dummy \nvariables as well as the number of peace years and population size are statistically \ninsignificant, however. \n \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \n \nThe insignificance of the Muslim dummy variable is particularly striking. What explains \nthe absence of a statistically significant effect? If one were to re-run the regression of column \nI without the democracy variable, then the Muslim dummy variable becomes highly \nstatistically significant. A strong correlation between the lack of democracy and a \npredominantly Muslim population is well known.71 The results therefore suggest that it is the \nlack of democracy in many Muslim countries rather than their being Muslim per se, which \ninhibits ratification of the Second Protocol. \nIn column II, we add per capita income, which leads to a reduction in sample size. \nEconomic development speeds up ratification of the Second Protocol. The ethnic \nfractionalization variable retains its negative coefficient sign, but becomes marginally \nstatistically insignificant, whereas more populous countries are now estimated to be less \n 20 \nrather than more likely to ratify (early on). The other variables are hardly affected. In column \nIII, we add the political orientation of the chief executive\u2019s party to the estimated model, \nwhich leads to a further reduction in sample size. A left-wing political orientation speeds up \nratification. The other variables are again little affected. Ethnic fractionalization becomes \nstatistically significant again with a hazard ratio below one, as theory would predict. There is \nevidence for regional diffusion as a higher average of ratifications within a region in the \nprevious year speeds up ratification when this variable is added to the model in column IV. \nCrucially, all the other variables remain the same in terms of statistical significance. Finally, \nin column V we want to test the impact of length of democratic experience on ratification. To \ndo so, we construct a variable that measures the number of years since 1800 a country has \ncontinuously been a democracy, defined as a Polity value of 6 or above.72 Unfortunately, this \nvariable cannot be included in the estimations alongside the Freedom House measure as the \ntwo variables are very highly correlated with each other (r = 0.6). The reported results in \ncolumn V show that it is the longer established democracies that ratify the Second Protocol \nearly on as the coefficient of the variable measuring the years of democracy has a hazard ratio \nabove one that is statistically significant. The other variables are hardly affected. \n \nCONCLUSION \nOur results suggest that regional diffusion, democracy, economic development, the left-wing \norientation of the chief executive\u2019s party, common law and ethnic fractionalization are \ndeterminants of ratification of the only universal treaty aimed at the abolition of the death \npenalty. How do these results compare to the determinants of death penalty abolition \ndomestically?73 Regional diffusion and democracy are consistent and robust determinants for \nboth. However, contrary to Moravcsik\u2019s suggestion74 we find that it is not the newly \nestablished, but the old democracies, which are more likely to ratify the Second Protocol \n 21 \n(early on). In many newly established democracies, particularly, but not exclusively in \nEastern Europe, abolition of the death penalty was undertaken due to outside pressure with \nlittle domestic enthusiasm for it, which might partly explain this result.75 \nPartisan effects are apparent both in domestic abolition and in ratification of the Second \nProtocol. This suggests that left-wing oriented governments take the opportunity to lock-in \ntheir preference for abolition. Some of the other results are also compatible. For example, in \nsome estimations we find that ethnically more fractionalized countries are less likely to ratify \nthe Second Protocol and they are also less likely to have abolished the death penalty \ndomestically. Countries with a predominantly Muslim population are not less likely to have \nratified the Second Protocol once democracy is controlled for. This mirrors the finding that \nthe share of Muslim population has no consistent and robust effect on death penalty abolition \neither. It is also noteworthy that whilst there are only six countries with a predominantly \nMuslim population that have abolished the death penalty, only two of these have not also \nratified the Second Protocol (Turkey and Albania, which has however signed it at least). \nSimilar to domestic death penalty abolition, no evidence is found that historical experience of \nviolent political conflicts has an effect on the likelihood of ratifying the Second Optional \nProtocol. Our analysis suggests that such experience is not likely to impose a barrier on \nabolition, dispersing a concern raised by Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen in this journal.76 \nIt is re-assuring that some of the main determinants of death penalty abolition within \ncountries in a global sample spanning the time period of more than half a decade (1950 to \n2001) are broadly similar to the determinants of Second Protocol ratification from the 1990s \nonwards. This similarity in results suggests that the variables included do not simply fit one \nspecific set of data, but really capture the fundamental drivers of abolition. Having said that, \nthere are also three main differences between the results on domestic death penalty abolition \nand the results reported here. \n 22 \nFirst, a common law legal system is more consistently related to a lower likelihood of \nSecond Protocol ratification than it is to a lower likelihood of domestic death penalty \nabolition. What this suggests is that even if common law countries abolish the death penalty, \nthey are reluctant to delegate authority and sovereignty about the issue to an international \nregime. As mentioned above, internationally binding commitments essentially bypass the \nevolutionary process of law development by judiciary precedent and are therefore less easily \ncompatible with a common law than with a civil law system, which might explain the \ndifference in results. \nSecond, the level of economic development is a determinant of Second Protocol \nratification, but not of domestic death penalty abolition. The latter confirms the observation \nthat many rich countries like Japan, Singapore and the United States retain the death penalty \nwhilst many poor countries have abolished it. Hence aversion against capital punishment in \nitself does not really seem to be what economists call a normal good, that is a good for which \ndemand rises with rising income. Instead, what seems to be a normal good is an international \ncommitment to abolition. This is in accordance with the fact that with the exception of \nCanada and France all Western developed abolitionist countries have also ratified the Second \nProtocol such that the abolitionist non-State Parties are almost exclusively Eastern European \nand developing countries. More research is needed to find out why the level of economic \ndevelopment is a significant determinant of Second Protocol ratification, but not of death \npenalty abolition as such. One likely explanation is that richer countries generally are more \nwilling and capable to negotiate, sign and ratify international treaties. In as much as economic \ndevelopment leads to power in the international system, realist theories would predict that \nricher countries are more likely to ratify. However, we do not find such an effect for \npopulation size. Indeed, in some estimations we find that more populous countries are less \n 23 \nrather than more likely to ratify. All in all, the evidence in favor of a realist account is \ntherefore limited. This leads us to the final and most striking difference in results. \nThird, the single greatest difference between the determinants of death penalty abolition \nand Second Protocol ratification is with respect to the Council of Europe membership dummy \nvariable. This variable is a highly significant determinant of domestic death penalty abolition, \nbut it is statistically insignificant as a determinant of Second Protocol ratification in all \nregressions. What this suggests is that Western European countries did not extend their \npressure on Eastern European countries towards a ratification of the Second Protocol. Once \nEastern European countries had abolished the death penalty within their jurisdiction and had \nbecome Parties to the Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention for the Protection of \nHuman Rights, Western European abolitionist countries were satisfied. Future research \nshould address the question why Western European countries, all of which are Parties to the \nSecond Protocol except France, did not go all the way in exerting pressure on Eastern \nEuropean countries and demanded that they join the Second Protocol as well. This failure is \nunfortunate from the perspective of the global abolitionist movement since it is only the \nSecond Protocol that has a universal coverage. It also puts the extent of EU commitment to \npromoting the international agenda for death penalty abolition in some doubt. If more Eastern \nEuropean abolitionist countries had become Parties to the Second Protocol, this would have \nrendered the treaty more successful and would have put more pressure on the remaining \nabolitionist and perhaps even retentionist countries to join. There is certainly no point for \nWestern European countries to initiate a United Nations resolution aimed at encouraging \ncountries to ratify the Second Optional Protocol if they cannot even persuade their Eastern \nEuropean partner countries to do so. \n 24 \nNotes\n \n1\n Throughout this article we treat ratification and accession equally. \n2\n For a detailed account of the developments at the UN leading up to the eventual passing of the Second \nProtocol, see W.A.

Tonry (ed) The Handbook of Crime & Punishment (New \nYork and Oxford: Oxford University Press 1998), pp.739-776, at p.743. \n4\n Important regional abolitionist treaties include the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights, \nadopted by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1990, and the Protocols No. 6 and \nNo. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1982 and 2002, \nrespectively. Of these international treaties, the Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights \nis the only one that demands abolition of the death penalty for all crimes, whereas the others allow parties to \nretain the penalty in time of war. \n5\n E. Neumayer, The Determinants of Death Penalty Abolition in Global Perspective. Mimeo (London School of \nEconomics 2005). \n6\n Italy is one of the few exceptions, where the death penalty became abolished early on in 1889, but was re-\ninstated under Mussolini rule in 1926 and became applicable again for ordinary crimes in 1930. Similarly, \nBrazil was abolitionist for ordinary crimes since 1882, but re-instated the death penalty for political crimes \nduring military dictatorship between 1969 and 1979 (United Nations, Status of the International Covenants on \nHuman Rights. Question of the Death Penalty. E\/CN.4\/1998\/82 (New York: United Nations Economic and \nSocial Council, 1998)). It is more common for de facto abolitionist countries, that is, countries that have not \nlegally abolished the death penalty, but have not executed anyone for some time, to revert to using capital \npunishment. R. Hood, \u2018Capital Punishment \u2013 A Global Perspective\u2019, Punishment & Society, Vol. 3 (2001), \npp.331-54, at p.335 reports that after 1994 eight countries previously considered de facto abolitionist resumed \nexecuting people. \n7\n This is subject to State Parties having accepted similar procedures within the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights. Also, State Parties can make a statement to the contrary at the moment of ratification or \naccession, but so far none has done so. \n \n 25 \n \n8\n B. Dun\u00e9r, and H.
