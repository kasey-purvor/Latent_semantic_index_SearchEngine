Several factors are known to control the HF echo\noccurrence rate, including electron density distribution in\nthe ionosphere (affecting the propagation path of the radar\nwave), D-region radio wave absorption, and ionospheric ir-\nregularity intensity. In this study, we consider 4 days of\nCUTLASS Finland radar observations over an area where the\nEISCAT incoherent scatter radar has continuously monitored\nionospheric parameters. We illustrate that for the event under\nconsideration, the D-region absorption was not the major fac-\ntor affecting the echo appearance. We show that the electron\ndensity distribution and the radar frequency selection were\nmuch more significant factors. The electron density magni-\ntude affects the echo occurrence in two different ways. For\nsmall F-region densities, a minimum value of 1 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123\nis required to have sufficient radio wave refraction so that the\northogonality (with the magnetic field lines) condition is met.\nFor too large densities, radio wave strong \u201cover-refraction\u201d\nleads to the ionospheric echo disappearance. We estimate\nthat the over-refraction is important for densities greater than\n4\u00d71011 m\u22123. We also investigated the backscatter power and\nthe electric field magnitude relationship and found no obvi-\nous relationship contrary to the expectation that the gradient-\ndrift plasma instability would lead to stronger irregularity in-\ntensity\/echo power for larger electric fields.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionospheric irregularities; plasma\nwaves and instabilities; auroral ionosphere)\n1 Introduction\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF co-\nherent radars (Greenwald et al., 1995) are an important in-\nstrument for studies of various high-latitude phenomena, es-\npecially the ones for which knowledge of plasma convec-\ntion is essential. In these studies, measured line-of-sight\nDoppler velocities are used either directly for an individual\nCorrespondence to: D. W. Danskin\n(danskin@dansas.usask.ca)\nradar or combined together to obtain two-dimensional con-\nvection maps. Ideally, convection could be monitored on\na global scale but in practice, measurements are limited to\nthose parts of the ionosphere from which strong F-region\nechoes are received. Recently, Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998)\ndeveloped a new technique (by applying a polynomial fit to\nexisting data) that allows for the expansion of convection\nmaps beyond the areas of actual radar measurements. For\nmost events, this technique enlarges the area where convec-\ntion predictions are available. However, for reliable convec-\ntion estimates, the physical radar coverage is desired to be as\nlarge as possible. In spite of good overall \u201cillumination\u201d of\nthe high-latitude ionosphere by the SuperDARN radars (cur-\nrently, there are 9 radars in the Northern Hemisphere and\n6 radars in the Southern Hemisphere), there are occasion-\nally extended spatial regions and prolonged periods of time\nwith low echo occurrence. A natural question is what are\nthe factors that control the appearance of F-regions coherent\nechoes?\nSeveral factors are known to determine whether F-region\ncoherent echoes can be detected (Fejer and Kelley, 1980;\nHanuise, 1983; Tsunoda, 1988; Greenwald et al., 1995). One\ncan divide these factors into two groups: one group is related\nto the radar wave propagation effects and the other is re-\nlated to the irregularity production factors. Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald (1997), by looking at echo statistics for the Goose\nBay HF radar, concluded that there are solar cycle, seasonal\nand diurnal variations in echo occurrence. In the auroral\nzone, echoes tend to occur more frequently near the maxi-\nmum of the solar cycle. This might occur due to the more fre-\nquent occurrence of strong electric fields during these years,\nand thus, the appearance of HF echoes. The echo power are\ngreatly determined by the intensity of ionospheric irregular-\nities. This notion has been recently elaborated on by Balla-\ntore et al. (2001), who showed that echo occurrence is sig-\nnificantly increased during periods of negative interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) Bz component conditions, when mag-\nnetospheric merging is enhanced and when stronger electric\nfields are expected. With respect to the season, Ruohoniemi\n1386 D. W.

The outlined sector is the location of beam 5 with the shaded area corresponding to the range bin\n16. The solid dot shows the area where ionospheric parameters were measured by the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar. Circles with pluses\ninside indicate the field-of-view for the Finnish riometers at a height of 90 km. Ellipses with pluses indicate the beam projections at 90 km\nfor the IRIS beams as indicated. Also shown are PACE lines of equal magnetic latitudes of 3 = 60\u25e6 and 3 = 70\u25e6.\nand Greenwald (1997) concluded that auroral zone echoes\noccurred more frequently during winter for the direct prop-\nagation mode, when radio waves reached the ionospheric ir-\nregularities by means of mildly refracted propagation. The\nlack of echoes during summer was interpreted as an effect\nof solar radiation in the sunlit ionosphere smoothing out the\nplasma gradients and reducing irregularity production. Ruo-\nhoniemi and Greenwald (1997) did not discuss the diurnal\nvariations, but their diagrams show that echoes tend to oc-\ncur more frequently during late afternoon-midnight-morning\nhours, although this depends strongly on the season. This\nmight again be indicative of the importance of the irregular-\nity production effects.\nOn the other hand, Milan et al. (1997), by investigating\n20-month statistics for the Co-operative UK Twin Located\nAuroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) HF radars in North-\nern Scandinavia, concluded that the electron density in the\nionosphere contributes strongly to the echo appearance at a\nspecific range. These authors described changes in the radar\nwave propagation modes and pointed out that the proper\namount of refraction is a very important factor leading to\npreferential time sectors and radar ranges for echo detection.\nIn addition, they also observed that the low echo occurrence\nduring the winter daytime for short distances is due to a lack\nof irregularities in the sub-auroral ionosphere. Finally, they\nconfirmed the low echo occurrence during summer. Milan\net al. (1997) reported a general decrease in F-region echoes\nwith magnetic activity increase. Ballatore et al. (2001) also\nnoted that there was no clear correlation between the polar\ncap echo occurrence and the merging electric field intensity,\nindicating other factors need to be considered.\nTo find the reason for the F-region echo appearance,\nnamely the threshold conditions, perhaps one needs to de-\ntermine all of the factors that control the power of echoes\nwhen they exist. In the past, only a few attempts have been\nmade in this direction (e.g. Villain et al., 1986; Milan et al.,\n1999; Fukumoto et al., 2000), mostly due to the difficulty of\nthe measurements of ionospheric parameters within the radar\nscattering volume. In this study, we combine HF data gath-\nered by the CUTLASS Hankasalmi radar with ionospheric\nmeasurements performed by the EISCAT incoherent scatter\nradar and riometer observations along the HF radar beam.\nWe consider an almost 4-day long period in February 1999\nand basically employ an approach of Milan et al. (1999).\n2 Experiment\nIn Fig. 1, we show the location of the CUTLASS Hankasalmi\nHF radar (62.3\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E) and its viewing zone between\nthe ranges of 400 and 1200 km at the height of 300 km. The\nradar was operated in the high time resolution mode with\nbeam scanning through 16 positions over 1 min. We con-\ncentrate here on observations in beam 5 whose orientation is\nshowed in Fig. 1 by straight lines within the overall view-\ning zone. This beam was selected because it overlaps with\nthe region where ionospheric parameters were monitored by\nthe incoherent scatter radar EISCAT (solid circle). The HF\nradar integration time was around 3 s and the range resolution\nwas 45 km with a starting range of 180 km. The operating\nD. W.

Horizontal solid line at\n900 km shows the range corresponding to the area where measurements were made by the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar. The gray color\ndenotes the ground scatter. MLT = UT + 2 h.\nfrequency was chosen to be 10.0 MHz during nighttime and\n12.4 MHz during daytime, to optimize the echo occurrence\nrate.\nThe EISCAT UHF radar worked in CP-1K mode with the\nremote antennas at Kiruna (Sweden) and Sodankyla\u00a8 (Fin-\nland) being oriented to a common area at a height of 250 km,\nwhere additional Doppler velocity measurements were per-\nformed by the Troms\u00f8 receiving antenna along the magnetic\nflux line. Such an arrangement allowed for tri-static electric\nfield measurements in the area close to bin 16 (slant range\nof 900 km) of the CUTLASS Hankasalmi radar. In addition\nto the electric field measurements, the electron density distri-\nbution with height was derived from the power of the return\nsignals at Troms\u00f8. The altitude resolution for EISCAT den-\nsity measurements was 22 km for the long pulse method in\nthe F-region, and 3.1 km for the alternate code method in the\nE- and D-regions. We considered 2-min averaged EISCAT\ndata in this study to have a time resolution as close as possi-\nble to the HF radar integration time.\nFinally, estimates of non-deviative D-region absorption for\nHF radio waves were obtained from the 38.2-MHz Imag-\ning Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) facility located\nat Kilpisjarvi, Finland (69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E) and from Finnish\nriometer stations at Oulu, Rovaniemi and Sodankyla\u00a8. The\nfield-of-view at a height of 90 km for the Finnish riometers\nand four IRIS beams are indicated by circles and ellipses, re-\nspectively, with a plus sign indicating the center of the beam.\nThe Finnish stations are located closer to the HF radio wave\nentry point into the D-region of ionosphere where the major-\nity of absorption occurs.\n3 Overview of the observational period\nWe consider the 4-day period of 9\u201312 February 1999,\nFigs. 2a\u2013d. The Hankasalmi HF radar observed echoes quite\noften throughout this interval, although many of the echoes\nwere ground scatter, as indicated in Fig. 2 in gray. Ground\nscatter is observed when radio waves are refracted to the\nground by the ionosphere and reflected back from the ground\n(for illustrations, see, for example, Villain et al., 1984).\nGround scatter was especially strong between 06:00 UT and\n18:00 UT, roughly from local sunrise to local sunset (MLT\n= UT + 2 h). Most of the ground scatter was at slant ranges\nlarger than the EISCAT observation spot (bin 16, range of\n900 km), indicated in Fig. 2 by a solid line. Also, short dis-\ntance meteor-like sporadic echoes were observed most of the\ntime in the evening-midnight-morning sector.\n1388 D. W.

Vertical bars in panels (a) and (b) indicate the times of HF echo occurrence in beam 5, bin\n16.\nIn this study, we are concerned about ionospheric scatter\nonly. For all 4 days, such echoes were observed mostly at\nlarge ranges of 2000\u20133000 km (Figs. 2a\u2013d). It is very likely\nthat these echoes were received through the 1 & 1\/2 hop\npropagation mode, when the radio waves experienced refrac-\ntion in the F-layer, ground reflection and propagation to the\nscatter points with return along the same path. On 9, 10 and\n11 February, the F-region densities between \u223c10:00 UT and\n\u223c15:00 UT were favorable for maintaining this mode (Milan\net al., 1997), as we will show later.\nOn 9 February, with the electron density decrease after\n15:00 UT, near local sunset time, echoes started to be re-\nceived at shorter and shorter distances so that between 16:00\nand 21:00 UT, the echo band was seen over the EISCAT spot.\nThis general morphology of ionospheric and ground scatter\nrepeated on other days. On 12 February (Fig. 2d), much more\nionospheric scatter was detected over the EISCAT spot dur-\ning noon hours.\nThe first 2 days were magnetically quiet, with Kp indices\nbeing around 1, while the other 2 days were moderately dis-\nturbed with typicalKp indices ranging between 3 and 4 (Cof-\nfey, 1999). Total horizontal magnetic perturbations (abso-\nlute value with respect to the background lines for X- and\nY -components) at a magnetic station near the EISCAT spot\n(Troms\u00f8) are presented in Fig. 3a. Very minor perturbations\n(<100 nT) are seen on 9 and 10 February, and much more\nsignificant perturbations (up to 300 nT) in the evening and\nmidnight MLT sectors on 11 and 12 February (for Troms\u00f8,\nroughly, MLT = UT + 2 h). In Figs. 3a and c, we indicate, by\nvertical bars, the times for the ionospheric HF echo appear-\nance over the EISCAT spot. A general trend seems to indi-\ncate that HF echoes occur during times of magnetic distur-\nbance; however, HF echoes were detected quite often during\nperiods of very low disturbances (10 February, 10:00 UT; 11\nFebruary, 06:00\u201308:00 UT). Also, one can notice an absence\nof echoes during periods of strongest magnetic disturbances\n(11 February, 01:00 UT, 14:00 UT; 12 February, 02:00 UT).\nThroughout the considered period, the EISCAT radar was\noperated almost continuously. EISCAT data were available\nstarting from 10:00 UT on 9 February all the way to 16:00 UT\non 12 February with an 8-h gap in electric field data on 11\nFebruary. The electric field (Fig. 3b) exhibited enhancements\nduring the evening and midnight hours for all days. EISCAT\nmeasurements of the ionospheric electron density at 110 km\n(E-region) and 250 km (F-region) are presented in Fig. 3c. In\nterms of F-region electron densities, the 9, 10, and 11 Febru-\nary events were very much typical, with densities reached\naround (5\u22127)\u00d71011 m\u22123 in the daytime sunlit ionosphere\n(sunrise and sunset times are around 06:00 UT and 15:00 UT,\nrespectively). On 12 February, the daytime F-region densi-\nties were about 2 times smaller than the previous days. E-\nregion densities were varying sporadically during each day.\nThis is not a surprise since the Sodankyla\u00a8 ionosonde regis-\ntered sporadic E-layer activity on each day, especially in the\nD.

Clearly, the observed mag-\nnetic perturbations were related to both variations of the elec-\ntric field magnitude and electron density in the E-layer.\nOn 10 February, very few ionospheric echoes were ob-\nserved at the EISCAT spot during daytime perhaps partly due\nto a fairly low electric field, less than 10 mV\/m (often even\nseveral times smaller). With an electric field increase during\nevening hours, matched with a decrease in the F-region elec-\ntron density (due to sunset), echoes started to appear more\nfrequently, especially around magnetic midnight, where F-\nregion densities were favorable for direct propagation mode.\nBetween 17:00 UT and 20:00 UT, a band of E-region echoes\nwas observed at closer ranges of \u223c 700 km.\nFor 11 February, electric field data were not available for\nthe first 8 h, during which there were some echoes obtained\nthrough the direct propagation mode to the EISCAT spot.\nLater during the day, echoes were observed again for moder-\nate values of F-region electron density and electric field.\nOn 12 February, simple eye inspection shows that HF echo\noccurrence at the EISCAT spot correlates well with the pe-\nriod of moderate F-region densities of 2 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123, low\nE-region densities of less than 1 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123 and occasion-\nally, an enhanced electric field. With the increase of the E-\nregion electron density after 14:00 UT, echoes were observed\nat ranges \u223c 600 km. Elevation angle measurements indicate\nthat these were E-region echoes.\nD-region absorption determined by the riometers near\nCUTLASS beam 5 is shown in Fig. 4. Absorption was re-\ncalculated from the original riometer records (at frequencies\n30\u201350 MHz) to the equivalent frequency of f = 12.4 MHz\nusing f\u22122 dependence. Clearly, absorption is almost negli-\ngible during the first two days and there are some enhance-\nments during the other two days, especially in the midnight\nsector. Also, absorption is larger at higher latitudes, as ex-\npected in the auroral zone. One can notice that for some\nperiods, during the considered 4 days (e.g. 10 February,\n10:00\u201316:00 UT) echoes were not detected. During these\nperiods enhanced absorption was observed at low latitudes\n(e.g. Rovaniemi riometer, Fig. 4f), suggesting that absorp-\ntion might be a factor in the echo disappearance. On the other\nhand, one can see that on 12 February, echoes were in abun-\ndance, even though the absorption was the strongest over the\n4-day period. One should also note that there were extended\nperiods when absorption was really small while echoes were\nnot observed.\n4 Relationship of echo power and various ionospheric\nparameters\nFrom the above review of the period under study, one can\nconclude that there is no one single factor that dominantly\ncontrols the HF echo appearance.

The histograms of occur-\nrence of riometer absorption (Fig. 5a) for the entire 4 days\n(solid line) and riometer absorption when ionospheric scat-\nterers were present during the 4 days (dotted line) indicate\nthat ionospheric scatterers are most likely when the absorp-\ntion is of the order of 2 dB. One can see that echoes are more\nintense for small amounts of absorption, less than 3 dB, with\nthe exception of a \u201cseparate\u201d cloud of 20 points at \u223c 25 dB.\nThese exceptional data came from observations on 12 Febru-\nary, around 13:30 UT (see the spike in absorption on Fig. 4g).\nThe line in Fig. 5b (drawn by hand) determines the limits of\nthe echo power for various amounts of two-way absorption.\nThis line shows a tendency for the echo power to decrease\nwith absorption, which is expected. However, the majority of\nobserved echoes correspond to small absorption values and\nthe conclusion from this graph is that if F-region echoes oc-\ncur, the amount of absorption does not substantially reduce\ntheir power nor completely absorb the radar waves. Similar\nconclusions were drawn from the comparison of echo power\nwith absorption at other riometer locations.\n4.2 Electron density and radio wave propagation\nPrevious studies have shown that both E- and F-region densi-\nties can be important for the F-region echo appearance (e.g.\nMilan et al., 1999). Electron density distribution in the iono-\nsphere controls, first of all, the amount of refraction for ob-\nservations at a specific range, e.g. Villain et al. (1984). In\norder to study the role of refraction in our measurements,\nwe temporally assume that F-region irregularities occupy all\nheights, from the bottom to the top of the F-region. Then the\nD. W.

Echo power versus electron density at the height of 250 km (a) for the daytime observations at 12.4 MHz (316 points) and (b) for the\nnighttime observations at 10.0 MHz (168 points). Dotted lines roughly encompass the maximum power observed for each electron density\nat 250 km.\nonly concern is an appropriate amount of refraction for the\nradio waves to reach magnetic flux lines orthogonally within\nthe scattering volume.\nIn Fig. 6, we present the power of observed echoes ver-\nsus electron density at the height of 250 km. The available\ndata were split into two sets: the top panel shows daytime\nobservations performed at the radar frequency of 12.4 MHz,\nwhile the bottom panel shows similar data for the nighttime\nobservations at the radar frequency of 10.0 MHz . The ten-\ndency is clear; there is an optimal density that provides the\ngreatest echo power for each radar frequency. These opti-\nmal values are around 2.0 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123 for at 12.4 MHz and\n1.4 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123 at 10.0 MHz. We interpret this result as\nfollows. At densities smaller than the optimal values, the\namount of refraction is not enough to meet the orthogonal-\nity condition within the expected area of scatter, while for\nhigher electron density over-refraction occurs and again, the\northogonality condition is not met.\nTo explore what optimal density means in terms of radio\nwave propagation for our observations, we made a series of\nray tracing modeling for the electron density profiles typi-\ncally observed by EISCAT during periods of echo registra-\ntion. We assumed that the density only varies with altitude,\nsince two-dimensional measurements of the profiles are not\navailable in the CP1 mode. By the identification of com-\nmon radar features predicted by the ray tracing, we believe\nthis approach is a valid first order approximation. In Fig. 7a,\nwe show three 10-min electron density profiles, as measured\nby EISCAT at 12:30 UT on 10 February (case (i)), and at\n12:30 UT (case (ii)) and 14:30 UT (case (iii)) on 12 Febru-\nary. In Figs. 7b\u2013d, we show the slant ranges and altitudes of\nexpected backscatter (with aspect angles within \u00b11\u25e6 range)\nby crosses along specific rays where the rays correspond to\nelevation angles of 6\u25e6\u201330\u25e6 in 2\u25e6 steps.\nIn Fig. 7b, we show that for electron densities typical for\ndaytime observations on several days, there are no chances\nto receive direct F-region echoes at \u223c 900 km, but there are\nopportunities to receive 1 & 1\/2 hop signals at \u223c 2500 km.\nAlso, reception of ground scatter is very likely from 1200\u2013\n2800 km. Ionospheric echoes are expected to come from the\naltitudes of 190\u2013250 km with elevation angles of 20\u25e6\u201330\u25e6.\nThese values of elevation angles are in reasonable agreement\nwith radar measurements. This diagram also predicts that\nechoes (from both E- and bottom F-regions) can be obtained\nfrom short distances, but they were not detected according to\nFig. 2b, except for sporadic traces of echoes at near ranges\nof 300\u2013600 km. We believe that E-region echo absence is\nrelated to the low electric field observed at this time.\nFigure 7c shows how propagation is affected due to a sub-\nstantially decreased F-region density, as was typical during\nthe daytime of 12 February. One can see no 1 & 1\/2 hop\npropagation mode here. After 14:00 UT, the E-region elec-\n1392 D. W.

Crosses indicate ranges where the ray is within \u00b11\u25e6 of orthogonality to the magnetic field.\ntron density was enhanced, which caused the rays to reach\northogonality only in at E-region altitude and at much shorter\nranges, as depicted in Fig. 7d. Thus, ray tracing supports\nour conclusions on the propagation modes that were in effect\nduring our measurements.\nAnother way the electron density distribution can affect\nthe appearance of F-region irregularities is through slowing\ndown the gradient-drift (GD) instability responsible for the\nirregularity excitation. This happens due to shorting out the\npolarization electric field in growing GD modes (Vickrey and\nKelley, 1982; Chaturvedi et al., 1994). We will explore this\neffect in the next sub-section, since it is closely related to the\nintensity of the electric field in the ionosphere.\n4.3 Electric field intensity\nThe existence of ionospheric irregularities of appropriate\nscale size ultimately determines the appearance of auroral\nechoes; without the irregularities no return echo could be de-\ntected. Unfortunately, not much is known about the proper-\nties of F-region irregularities of decameter scale (Fejer and\nKelley, 1980; Hanuise, 1983; Tsunoda, 1988). In the auro-\nral zone, the most likely mechanism of F-region irregularity\nformation is the gradient-drift instability. The positive con-\ntribution to the growth rate of the GD instability is deter-\nmined by the electric field magnitude, the scale of the back-\nground gradient and their mutual orientation (Keskinen and\nOssakow, 1982). Damping of the GD waves is determined\nby the diffusion (dependent on the temperatures and collision\nfrequencies of charged particles). As mentioned above, dif-\nfusion can be enhanced in the presence of highly conducting\nE-layer (Vickrey and Kelley, 1982). According to Vickrey\nand Kelley (1982), the effect is determined by the param-\neter \u03b6 = 1 \u2212M\u22121, where M = 1 + 6Fp \/6Ep and 6Ep and\n6Fp are the height integrated Pedersen conductances of the E-\nand F-layers, respectively. For a poorly conducting E-layer,\n6Ep \u2192 0, M \u2192\u221e and \u03b6 \u2192 1. For a highly conducting E-\nlayer, M \u2192 1 and \u03b6 \u2192 0 and the growth rate of the GD in-\nstability is greatly decreased. In this section, we explore the\nrole of both these factors in observations of F-region echoes.\nFigure 8 is a scatter plot of echo power versus electric field\nmagnitude separated once again into daytime and nighttime\nevents. There is a significant data spread here; however, dur-\ning the daytime, points seem to show a power increase, as\nindicated by the shaded circles which represent the average\npower in each 10 mV\/m electric field bin. Overall, one can\nsay that a stronger electric field is preferred. For the night-\ntime, no such trend is seen. However, for the night-time fre-\nquency, there does appear to be a limit in the electric field\nof about 20 mV\/m above which the power does not exceed\n20 dB. Indeed, some echoes observed at electric fields as high\nas 80 mV\/m were of low intensity.\nD. W.

Shaded circles in (a) indicate the average power in the associated\n10 mV\/m electric field bin.\nIn Fig. 9, we explore the effect of a conducting E-layer on\nthe echo appearance. We plot here the height-integrated con-\nductances of the E- and F-layers and the parameter M for the\ntimes when EISCAT density measurements are available. We\nrepresented the E-layer arbitrary as being contained between\n90 and 140 km, with the F-layer being spread over altitudes\nabove 140 km, similar to Milan et al. (1999). We also indi-\ncate by vertical bars in Fig. 9c the times for the echo appear-\nance over the EISCAT spot. The general impression from\nFig. 9 is that echoes are mostly observed during the times of\nlow values of the M factor. Contrary to expectation, every\ntime M was enhanced at noon, very few echoes were seen.\nOne should note that periods of high M values typically also\ncoincide with periods of low electric field, so the judgment\non the importance of the effect is difficult to ascertain. For\nexample, on 11 February, the echoes were seldom between\n08:00 UT and 13:00 UT, even though the M value was en-\nhanced and the electric field was about 10 mV\/m or so. On\nthe other hand, on 12 February, at \u223c02:00 UT, echoes were\nobserved, as predicted, when the M values were enhanced,\nperhaps due to a simultaneously enhanced electric field.\nOne important feature of the data presented in Fig. 9 worth\nmentioning is that the observations right at the end of the pe-\nriod on 12 February at 14:00\u201315:00 UT show M values to\nbe unusually low, while the electric field was strong, but no\nechoes were observed. To clarify this point, we present data\nfor 12 February, 10:00\u201316:00 UT in Fig. 10 with better time\nresolution than data in Fig. 9. One can see the effect easily\nas the value of M approaches 1; the instability is inhibited.\nHowever, this is not the likely reason for the lack of F-region\nechoes at this time. As we discussed in Sect. 4.2, echo disap-\npearance at this time is very likely due to enhanced density in\nthe lower portion of the ionosphere, so that HF radar waves\nare refracted to smaller heights and closer ranges (Fig. 7d).\nAnother similar event is around 11:40 UT on this day.\nOn the other hand, looking at Fig. 10 and Fig. 7c, one can\nnotice that short-lived echo disappearance is not always re-\nlated to propagation effects. For example, around 13:00 UT,\nthere was no significant redistribution of electron density (no\nchange in conductance), but echoes disappeared, perhaps due\nto the decrease in electric field magnitude.\n5 Discussion\nOver the last decade, statistics for various parameters of F-\nregion HF coherent echoes have been reported, including\npower, spectral width and velocity (Milan et al., 1997; Milan\nand Lester, 1998; Huber, 1999; Fukumoto et al., 1999, 2000;\nHosokawa et al., 2001, 2002). However, not much attention\nhas been paid to a fundamental question on the major fac-\ntor(s) controlling the appearance of such echoes. Certainly,\n1394 D. W.

It is important to realize\nthat at HF, several propagation modes are important, so that\nan assessment of various factors certainly should take this\ncircumstance into account.\nIn this study, we consider the simplest case when F-region\nechoes are received through the direct F-region propagation\nmode. In this case, radio waves reach F-region irregulari-\nties through the appropriate amount of refraction (this mode\nis also called 1\/2F mode, Milan et al., 1997). But even for\nthis simple situation, we had a very limited data set to work\nwith. Namely, we had measurements of electron densities at\nthe scattering volume and extrapolated these measurements\nalong the HF radar beam. One should also bear in mind that\nthe areas of EISCAT and CUTLASS effective collecting vol-\numes are quite different for each instrument. EISCAT mea-\nsures parameters in an area with a diameter of \u223c 3 km at the\nheight of 250 km, while the effective area for the CUTLASS\nradar has dimensions of \u223c 45 km\u00d7 150 km. No information\non irregularity heights was available. Without knowing much\nabout the thickness of the irregularity layer for the HF mea-\nsurements (is it several kilometers or hundred kilometers?),\nthe conclusions drawn from the ray tracing are not decisive.\nThe effect of the irregularity filling the coherent radar beam\nhas been studied by Walker et al. (1987).\nFor the event under consideration, we found that echo de-\ntection at the point of EISCAT observations (geomagnetic\nlatitude of \u223c 66.5\u25e6) is strongly determined by the propaga-\ntion conditions. The electron density distribution in the iono-\nsphere must be appropriate to support radio wave propaga-\ntion exactly to the expected area of joint observations, as in\nFig. 7c.\nMost of the echoes at the EISCAT observational area\ntended to occur during evening and midnight hours, the pref-\nerential period for Hankasalmi echoes at these latitudes (Mi-\nlan et al., 1997). Echoes occurred for electron densities in\nbetween 1.0\u00d7 1011 m\u22123 and 4\u00d7 1011 m\u22123, which is exactly\nwhat is needed for radio wave focusing to the F-layer heights,\naccording to the ray tracing analysis. The derived densities\nare consistent with the finding of Milan et al. (1997) that\nechoes typically occur for an F-layer critical frequency of\n4 MHz.\nOne should say that during daytime\/early evening hours in\nFebruary 1999 stronger densities in the F-layer are usually\nachieved (according to the EISCAT measurements for 9, 10\nand 11 February and according to the Sodankyla\u00a8 ionosonde\nstatistics, see Milan et al. (1997), Fig. 7). Hence, the direct\nmode for F-region echoes should occur, if ever, at shorter dis-\ntances. Hankasalmi echo occurrence rates published by Mi-\nlan et al. (1997) do not have enough spatial resolution to see\nD. W.

Recent echo occurrence analysis performed\nby D. Andre\u00b4 (results are not published) confirms that maxi-\nmum of echo occurrence for February 1999 is located at 2\u25e6\u2013\n3\u25e6 lower than normal latitudes, in agreement with expecta-\ntions. Our observations for 9, 10, and 11 February are also\nin agreement with this expectation. On 12 February, echoes\nwere observed in the noon sector, but as we demonstrated,\nthe densities were \u223c 2 times smaller during this day.\nOne would expect another desirable effect with density\nincrease, namely a better chance to obtain echo detection\nthrough the 1 & 1\/2 propagation mode, since in this case,\nstrong bending is more likely through refraction. Milan et al.\n(1997) clearly demonstrated that Hankasalmi daytime echoes\nare typically cusp\/cleft echoes obtained through this mode,\nand other reports (e.g. Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1997;\nHosokawa et al., 2001) support this conclusion.\nOne should mention that Hosokawa et al. (2001) found\nquite a few afternoon\/evening echoes being produced at the\npoleward edge of the mid-latitude ionospheric trough. As we\nmentioned in Sect. 3, indeed echoes started to be observed\nmore frequently right after the local sunset for the F-region,\nso the horizontal plasma gradient associated with the trough\nmight have contributed well to the preferential irregularity\nformation during these hours. In addition, Hosokawa et al.\n(2001) did find a second morning peak in echo occurrence\nfor the Canadian radars, but not for the Hankasalmi radar. In\nour event, quite a few echoes were observed during morn-\ning hours on 10 and 11 February and perhaps on 9 Febru-\nary (EISCAT measurements are not available here, but So-\ndankyla\u00a8 ionosonde data support this conclusion) prior to lo-\ncal sunrise. One can conclude that F-region echoes at the\nEISCAT spot for February can be related to the trough. For\ncertain, echoes are seen when the ionosphere experiences a\ntransition from the daytime to the nighttime configuration in\nthe evening sector and from the nighttime to the daytime in\nthe morning sector.\nOur conclusion of the primary role of refraction as a factor\nfor the HF echo appearance refers to one specific point in the\nHankasalmi radar field-of-view (FoV). It cannot be simply\nextrapolated to other areas within this radar FoV, not to say\nanything about other SuperDARN radars. Besides refraction,\nthe issue here is whether strong F-region irregularities exist\nat all ionospheric heights accessible to radar waves. This\nis especially important for observations within the polar cap,\nwhere the background density is not strong enough to support\nrefraction as it can in the auroral zone. Polar cap patches of\nF-region background ionization are important in two ways:\nthey provide enhanced refraction and, on the other hand, the\ngradients at their edges are the primary areas for the exci-\ntation of the GD instability (Tsunoda, 1988). These clouds\nare certainly limited in their horizontal extent and height. So\nfor the polar cap echoes the propagation conditions should\nbe matched with the irregularity production conditions.\nThe prime importance of proper refraction conditions for\necho appearance does not mean that other factors are not im-\n1396 D. W. Danskin et al.: On the factors controlling occurrence of F-region coherent echoes\nportant. First of all, with respect to the D-region absorption,\nwe should mention that the events under consideration were,\nby chance, for quiet and moderately disturbed days. The ab-\nsorption was very small at the range (\u223c 300 km) where the\nrays that intersect the F-region at \u223c 900 km were passing\nthrough the D-region. Stronger absorption was detected at\nsome larger ranges, which might affect scatter at ranges be-\nyond 900 km, although this assessment is complicated due to\nthe presence of ground scatter at these ranges. We would ex-\npect more significant importance of D-region absorption dur-\ning more disturbed days when the region of strong particle\nprecipitation is shifted equatorward. It is well documented\nnow that HF radar echoes quickly disappear at the expansive\nphase of a substorm developing in the local time sector of\nradar measurements (e.g. Voronkov et al., 1999).\nThe irregularity production factors are also important. For\nthe considered events, the IMF Bz component was mostly\nnegative, so that one would expect mostly strong electric\nfields in the auroral zone, and the EISCAT measurements in-\ndeed show E fields in excess of the 5\u201310 mV\/m needed for\nthe excitation of the GD instability. The daytime data pre-\nsented in Fig. 8 indicate that echo power generally increases\nwith electric field. This conclusion is consistent with the sta-\ntistical analysis of the echo power-Doppler velocity relation-\nship performed by Fukumoto et al. (1999, 2000). These au-\nthors found that the power of echoes increases with the l-o-s\nvelocity, clearly during daytime, and in more complicated\nfashion in the midnight sector. This is similar to our results, if\none assumes that the l-o-s velocity increases because of elec-\ntric field enhancement (power variations with the flow angle\nare not expected for the F-region echoes, though analysis of\nthis effect has not been done yet). One would expect the den-\nsity fluctuation level increase with the electric field, since GD\ninstability is strongly dependent on the electric field magni-\ntude (Tsunoda, 1988).\nOur analysis shows that besides a strong electric field, the\nconductance of the E-region must be taken into account when\nthe irregularity production is considered; this conclusion is\nsimilar to one of Milan et al. (1999). For example, on 11\nFebruary, between 16:00 and 18:00 UT, the propagation con-\nditions were satisfactory, Ne = 2 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123, the electric\nfield was of reasonable intensity, 20 mV\/m, and as a conse-\nquence of reasonably small M values, echoes were not seen\nover the EISCAT spot. However, the situation was not al-\nways clear. Contrary to prediction, we showed that echoes\nwere not always observed when M factor values were large.\nSeveral other effects can explain the echo absence over the\nEISCAT spot. One of these is that propagation conditions\nmight have been such that one would need irregularities to\nbe intense below 200 km. It well might be that irregularities\nsimply were not generated at these heights. It is expected\nthat the GD instability is efficient at the edges of plasma\nclouds in the F-region, and it might be that ionospheric gra-\ndients were not strong enough to generate the irregularities,\nalthough with the current experiment, the horizontal gradient\ncould not be measured. Further studies should be carried out\nto ascertain the effects of horizontal gradients on the produc-\ntion of F-region irregularities.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this study, we attempted to evaluate the factors influenc-\ning the F-region echo appearance at a specific spot in the high\nlatitude ionosphere. The monitored area was conveniently lo-\ncated for a direct HF propagation mode. A 4-day period was\nconsidered with 2 relatively quiet days and 2 moderately dis-\nturbed days. Overall, significant amounts of echoes were ob-\nserved. We found that D-region absorption is a minor factor\nfor the echo detection. Often absorption just decreased the\npower of the signals. We also demonstrated that echoes were\nmore intense for a stronger electric field, though often, they\noccurred for a fairly low electric field of \u223c 10 mV\/m. The\nmost significant factor that controls echo appearance was the\nelectron density distribution in the ionosphere, both in the E-\nand F-regions. F-region density controls radio wave propa-\ngation\/focusing to the test spot and the density needs to be in\nbetween 0.5\u00d71011 m\u22123 and 4\u00d71011 m\u22123. E-region density,\nbesides supporting the propagation mode, may perhaps influ-\nence the wave electric field of F-region irregularities, so that\nin the case of a very dense E-region, the instability is slowed\ndown or even prevented by the enhanced conductance.\nAcknowledgements.
