Most parasitoid\ninsects are hymenopterans, and an important fraction of\nthese belong to the family Braconidae. Study of insect par-\nasitoids is important in order to characterise their biodi-\nversity, understand their evolution, and in some cases\nmake use of their parasitic abilities for practical purposes,\nsuch as biological pest control [1]. In this paper we focus\non the evolution of the Braconidae subfamily Rogadinae,\na cosmopolitan and highly diverse group of Lepidoptera-\nparasitizing wasps with exclusively koinobiont biology,\ni.e., allowing the recovery and subsequent temporary\ndevelopment of the host after attack [2-4]. The rogadines\nare currently divided into four tribes, the Clinocentrini,\nStiropiini, Yeliconini and Rogadini [5-7] (Figure 1). The\nlatter is by far the most diverse as it contains the highly\nspeciose and widely distributed genus Aleiodes Wesmael,\nwith more than 300 of the approximately 500 species cur-\nrently described for the subfamily [5-7]. Rogadines are\ncurrently defined only by a single biological synapomor-\nphy, the 'mummification' of the host larvae [5], whereby\nthe wasp deposits her egg (or eggs in a few cases) inside a\nhost caterpillar which, after the parasitoid larva has com-\npleted feeding, turns into a variously hardened and\ntanned mummy within which the parasitoid pupates. It\nhas been proposed that this complex strategy has resulted\nfrom selective pressures that are intimately related to the\nbiology of a particular host species, and the results are\napparent from the observed variability of mummy type\nwithin and between the tribes [8,9].\nDespite the scant knowledge of host ranges within Rogad-\ninae, a variety of lepidopteran host groups have been con-\nfirmed. Species of the Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and\nYeliconini are only known to attack 'microlepidopteran'\nlarvae [8,10,11], most of which are concealed feeders\n[12]. On the other hand, members of Rogadini, as cur-\nrently recognised [13], attack both micro- and macrolepi-\ndopteran larvae [8], the latter generally having exposed\nfeeding habits [12,14]. In Aleiodes, however, parasitism\nhas been observed to occur almost exclusively on mac-\nrolepidopteran hosts, although some microlepidopterans\nwith similar exposed feeding habits (e.g. species of Zygae-\nnidae, Yponomeutidae and Pterophoridae) are also\nattacked by a few species, and only in rare cases does Alei-\nodes attack macrolepidopterans living in semi-concealed\nsituations [7].\nThe few molecular phylogenetic analyses that have exam-\nined the evolutionary relationships within the Rogadinae\nhave been constrained by limited taxon sampling. Chen et\nal. [15] presented the only molecular phylogenetic study\ndevoted exclusively to the subfamily but included only 20\nspecies collectively representing nine genera, and the work\nwas based on a single DNA sequence fragment (449\u2013482\nbp of the D2 variable region of the 28S rDNA gene).\nAlthough most of the relationships investigated could not\nbe resolved with confidence, the Rogadini and its sub-\ntribes were not recovered as monophyletic.\nMore recently, Zald\u00edvar-River\u00f3n et al. [16] carried out a\nsimultaneous molecular and morphological phylogenetic\nanalysis among the cyclostome subfamilies of Braconidae\n(braconids have traditionally been divided into two major\ngroups, the cyclostomes and non-cyclostomes, based on\nthe presence\/absence of an oral opening formed by a ven-\ntrally concave clypeus). They employed two gene regions\n(28S rRNA and COI mtDNA genes) and included repre-\nsentatives of 15 rogadine genera and 19 species. They\nrecovered a weakly supported monophyletic Rogadinae\n[16] and some relationships that were not concordant\nwith the existing classification of the group, including a\nnon-monophyletic Rogadini, with most members recov-\nered as the sister group of Stiropiini, and with an Aleiodes\nclade sister to Yeliconini.\nNeither of the above studies dealt with the evolution of\nmummification nor host ranges, nor did they estimate\ndivergence times. Here we reconstruct the first extensive\nphylogeny for the Rogadinae using a combination of cyto-\nchrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA and 28S rDNA gene\nsequences. Based on the trees obtained, we evaluate the\ncurrent higher-level classification of the Rogadinae. We\nalso estimate times of divergence and assess the evolution\nof host ranges and mummification within the group.\nFinally, we discuss the driving force for the extraordinary\ndiversification within Aleiodes\nResults\nMolecular phylogenies\nThe Bayesian topologies obtained from the separate 28S\nand COI analyses are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The 28S\ntopology has a considerably higher number of clades with\nBayesian posterior probabilities (PP) \u2265 0.8 compared to\nthe COI one (28S: PP 0.8\u20130.94 = 72, PP \u2265 0.95 = 61; COI:\nPP \u2265 0.8\u20130.94 = 34, PP \u2265 0.95 = 44). The two separate\nanalyses recover a number of similar relationships, and\nthere are no significantly supported clades in conflict\nbetween them. Among the similar relationships recovered\nby both separate analyses are a clade with the species of\nAleiodes Wesmael, Cordylorhogas Enderlein, Hemigyroneu-\nron Baker and Pholichora Achterberg ('Aleiodes clade' here-\ninafter) (PP: 28S = 0.69; COI = 0.45), a Yeliconini +\nAleiodes clade (PP: 28S = 0.7; COI = 0.52), and a clade\nwith the remaining Rogadini genera (PP: 28S = 1.0; COI =\n0.96).\nThe phylogenetic affinities of the two examined members\nof the non-rogadine tribe Cedriini, Cedria Wilkinson and\nCarinitermus Achterberg, vary considerably between thePage 2 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329\nPage 3 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPhotographs of Rogadinae waspsFigure 1\nPhotographs of Rogadinae wasps.

These taxa appear\nweakly supported in the simultaneous analysis at the base\nof the Aleiodes + Yeliconini clade, a highly unlikely rela-\ntionship considering the extreme difference in morpho-\nlogical and life history features. We therefore carried out\nan additional simultaneous analysis excluding both\nCedria and Carinitermus. The topology of the latter analy-\nsis was similar to the one that included the above two gen-\nera, and thus we only show the topology that excluded\nthem.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the 50% majority rule consensus\ntree derived from simultaneous analysis of the two gene\nfragments. This has considerably more clades with PP \u2265\n0.8 (PP 0.8\u20130.94 = 101; PP \u2265 0.95 = 80) than either of the\ntopologies from the separate analyses. Among the signifi-\ncantly supported relationships that are congruent with the\ncurrent classification of Rogadinae are the monophylies of\nClinocentrini, Stiropiini, and Yeliconini (PPs = 0.93, 1.0,\nand 1.0, respectively). The Rogadinae and Lysiterminae\nwere also found to be monophyletic, though with weak\nsupport (PPs = 0.35 and 0.75, respectively). Some other\nrelationships, however, are in disagreement with current\ntaxonomy. Members of the Rogadini (sensu van Achter-\nberg [13]) are grouped in two separate clades. One of\nthese, with significant support (PP = 1.0), consists largely\nof the included species of Aleiodes (PP = 0.86), which form\nthe sister group to the Yeliconini (PP = 1.0). The second\nclade (PP = 0.4) contains most of the remaining Rogadini\nspecies (PP = 1.0) as sister group to the Stiropiini (PP =\n1.0) and with the Clinocentrini (PP = 0.94) at the base.\nThe Betylobraconinae (sensu Belokobylskij et al. [17]) was\nnot recovered as monophyletic, with the Australian Meso-\ncentrus Sz\u00e9pligeti and Betylobracon Tobias instead forming\na grade between Lysiterminae and Rogadinae, and with\nAulosaphobracon as sister group of all of them (PP = 0.53).\nThe Aleiodes clade additionally includes members of\nanother three genera, Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron and\nCordylorhogas. Relatively few of the species groups pro-\nposed by Fortier and Shaw [18] for which we included\nmore than one representative were significantly sup-\nported, but rather the relationships were congruent with\nthe currently recognised subgeneric classification of Alei-\nodes (Figure 5). Their A. dispar (Haliday) group (PP = 1.0),\nwith the exclusion of A. punctipes (Thomson), forms the\nsister group to a clade with the subgenus Arcaleiodes + the\nremaining Aleiodes species (PP = 1.0). The two other\ngroups proposed by Fortier and Shaw [18] that were\nrecovered were the A. gasterator (Jurine) and the A. circum-\nscriptus (Nees) [including A. esenbeckii (Hartig) and A. sp.\n8] groups. The species known to produce suspended\nmummies [9] appeared significantly supported as mono-\nphyletic (PP = 1.0). The 28S motif TGCGT located at posi-\ntions 264\u2013268 [stems 3i'-3j of the 28S braconid secondary\nstructure model of Gillespie et al. [19]] in our alignment\nis highly conserved within the Rogadinae and within the\nBraconidae in general, and is retained in the dispar group;\nhowever, the homologous positions in the remaining\nAleiodes species as well as in Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron\nand Cordylorhogas display a derived AGCGT motif.\nA clade with the members of the subtribe Spinariina with\nthe inclusion of Cornutorogas (PP = 0.56) appears deeply\nnested within the clade including the remaining members\nof Rogadini (defined in a restricted sense, i.e. excluding\nthe species assigned to Aleiodes together with Pholichora,\nHemigyroneuron and Cordylorhogas). The Neotropical spe-\ncies of Triraphis constitute a significantly supported clade\n(PP = 1.0) that excludes the only Old World species of this\ngenus included here.\nNone of the credible set of trees obtained from the simul-\ntaneous analysis recovered Aleiodes as currently consti-\ntuted as monophyletic, nor a monophyletic Triraphis,\nRogadini (including Aleiodes) and Rogadina (i.e. exclud-\ning Spinariina), and thus these alternative hypotheses are\nstatistically rejected.\nAges of diversification in Rogadinae\nThe times of divergence of selected clades (mean, standard\ndeviation and range) using the penalised likelihood (PL)\nand Bayesian relaxed phylogenetics (RP) approaches are\ngiven in Table 1 and the chronogram for RP is shown in\nFigure 6.\nBecause of the uncertainty associated with the calibration\nof the Aleiodes s. l. clade (see Figure 6 for identifying this\nclade), we ran PL both including (PLiA) and excluding\n(PLeA) the calibration associated to Aleiodes s. l. Ten of the\nfifteen clades that were examined in the two PL analyses\nhave a PP value equal to or higher than 0.95 in our 28S +\nCOI Bayesian phylogeny, and thirteen of them higher\nthan 0.8 (Figures 4 and 5). The taxonomic composition of\nthe clades examined using the PL approach was the same\nas for the 100 sampled trees except in two relationships,\nwhich were not present in four and one of the sampled\ntrees, respectively (see Table 1).\nThe RP analyses including (RPiA) and excluding (RPeA)\nthe Aleiodes s. l. node calibration both recovered most of\nthe relationships found using MrBayes except for the\nRogadini + Stiropiini clade, which was not recovered in the\nRPeA analysis. The age estimates of clades obtained by the\ntwo RP analyses are generally similar; thus, we only show\nthe ultrametric tree derived from the RPiA analysis,\nbecause it incorporated more node calibrations (Figure 6).\nThe age estimates derived from the two RP analyses are\ngenerally earlier than those from the PL ones (Table 1).Page 6 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329\nPage 7 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBayesian phylogram derived from the 28S + COI data setsFigure 4\nBayesian phylogram derived from the 28S + COI data sets.

The ances-\ntral reconstructions of the basal Rogadinae clades for the\ndegree of hardness of the mummy were recovered as\nequivocal (MP) and with low APP values. Forming a hard\nmummy, however, appears marginally as nonsignificant\nin the Aleiodes clade. The latter condition also appears to\nhave evolved independently in a few members of the\nRogadini clade (Cystomastax and some species of Trira-\nphis) and in some species of Clinocentrus.\nUse of microlepidopteran hosts was recovered by both\nmethods as the ancestral condition for the Rogadinae, but\nonly with a low APP with the Bayesian method.

Our study covered representatives of the different\nsupraspecific taxa within the subfamily, as well as a\nnumber of putatively closely related groups that have pre-\nviously been considered to belong to this group (viz. Bety-\nlobraconinae, Lysiterminae, Pentatermus Hedqvist; e.g.\n[13]). Our simultaneous analysis recovered a mono-\nphyletic Rogadinae as currently recognised, though with a\nnon-significant PP. This, and the placement of the betylo-\nbraconines Mesocentrus and Betylobracon at the base of the\nRogadinae clade leave the actual extent of the subfamily\nunresolved and probably the Betylobraconinae ought to\nbe synonymised with the Rogadinae, especially if it were\nfound that they mummify their hosts. Further work is also\nneeded to confirm the phylogenetic position of the Clino-\ncentrini. Unlike previous studies that recovered Clinocen-\ntrini at the base of the Rogadinae [15,16], in our study this\ntribe appeared weakly supported as sister group of the Sti-\nropiini + Rogadini clade.\nIn the separate 28S and COI analyses as well as in the\nsimultaneous analysis, the Aleiodes clade appears as the\nsister group to the Yeliconini, whereas in the latter two\nanalyses a clade comprising the remaining genera of\nRogadini (i.e. in the new sense of excluding Aleiodes and\nits close relatives) together with the Stiropiini was also\nrecovered (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively). Since these rela-\ntionships are consistent between the two gene markers, we\npropose the new tribe Aleiodini nov. for the members of\nthe Aleiodes clade, within which we recognise two genera,\nAleiodes and Heterogamus stat. rev. (see below).\nThe relationships recovered within Aleiodes s. l. were con-\ncordant with its subgeneric classification [13] except for\nthe only examined member of the subgenus Neorhogas,\nwhich appeared deeply nested within a clade with the\nmembers of the subgenus Aleiodes. Of the species groups\nproposed for Aleiodes by Fortier and Shaw [18] based on\nmorphological evidence alone, only the A. dispar, A.\ngasterator and A. circumscriptus groups were partially con-\ngruent with our molecular phylogeny. Of these groups,\nthe A. dispar group should be treated as a separate genus\naccording to its phylogenetic position and morphological\ndistinctiveness [Heterogamus stat. rev.: type species A. (H.)\ncrypticornis Wesmael = H. dispar (Haliday)]. Moreover, the\nderived 28S AGCGT motif present in Aleiodes s.s. is absent\nin Heterogamus.

Also, Heterogamus\nspecies all have forewing vein r relatively long in relation\nto vein 3-SR, though this state is also displayed by a range\nof Aleiodes s. s. species. An elongate head with a low\nclypeus (below lower level of eyes), narrow and usually\n(in females) somewhat banded wings, and long prono-\ntum are also distinctive features in Heterogamus, though\nthese are also occasionally present in some species of Alei-\nodes (Shaw and van Achterberg, unpubl. data). Further,\nthe venom gland apparatus in examined members of Het-\nerogamus appears to be less modified than those present in\nthe species of Aleiodes s. s. [20], which is congruent with\nthe basal position recovered for this taxon within Alei-\nodini.\nThe three previously-recognised genera that were recov-\nered as nested within Aleiodes s. s., i.e. Pholichora, Hemigy-\nroneuron and Cordylorhogas, are distinguished by the\npossession of various derived morphological features (e.g.\nvein cu-a of fore wing strongly curved in Hemigyroneuron,\nvein 1-1A curved subapically and subbasal cell with a pair\nof patches in Pholichora, and posterior corner of first meta-\nsomal tergite acutely protruding and second tergite with\ncrest-like lateral carina in Cordylorhogas [13]). However,\nthese genera also possess morphologies characteristic of\nAleiodes, such as tarsal claws without a basal lobe, setose\nhind tibial spurs, and otherwise similar wing venation\nand metasomal carination [13]. Also Pholichora, Hemigy-\nroneuron and Cordylorhogas have the derived AGCGT 28S\nrDNA motiff (see above). Based on the latter information\nand our molecular phylogeny, we therefore synonymise\nthe above three genera (Hemigyroneuron: type species H.\nspeciosus Baker; Pholichora: type species Hemigyroneuron\nmadagascariensis Granger; Cordylorhogas: type species C. tri-\nfasciatus Enderlein) with Aleiodes (syn. nov.), and all spe-\ncies currently classified within each of these are hereby\ntransferred to Aleiodes (comb. nov.). We therefore pro-\npose that Aleiodes s. s. should be represented by the sub-\ngenera Aleiodes (including Neorhogas and Cordylorhogas),\nChelonorhogas (including Hemigyroneuron), Pholichora and\nArcaleiodes.\nTwo further relationships recovered here are also sup-\nported by features of the venom gland apparatus [20].\nOne of them, supported by the presence of a hard second-\nary venom duct with filaments, consistently shows that\nSpinariina is actually a derived group within the Rogadini,\nand thus the subtribal names employed within Rogadini\n(viz. Rogadina and Spinariina) should be eliminated. The\nother relationship, supported by the presence of distinct\nsecondary venom duct branching patterns, suggests a\npolyphyletic Triraphis, with the American species being\nmore closely related to other members of the Rogadini\nrather than to the only examined Old World species of\nthis genus. Members of Triraphis from the New World had\npreviously been assigned to Rogas (e.g. [20,21]); however,\na recent study based on van Achterberg's [13] definition of\nrogadine genera revealed that all the examined species\nfrom the New World previously assigned to Rogas actually\nbelong to Triraphis (sensu lato) and that Rogas may be\nabsent from this region [22].\nAges of diversification in the Rogadinae\nThe oldest cyclostome fossil that has been found to date\n(93 MYA [23]) has a considerably more recent age than\nthe times of origin estimated for Ditrysia, which is the lep-\nidopteran group that comprises all the taxa attacked by\nrogadines and that has been calculated to have originated\n157.6 to 191.9 MYA [24]. The available fossil evidence\nthus indicates that the Rogadinae originated considerably\nlater than its host group, with our molecular dating esti-\nmates showing that its MRCA originated during the mid\nto late Eocene. Our molecular dating estimates also show\nthat the Aleiodini has a more recent origin (late Miocene\nto mid Eocene) than the origins estimated for two of its\nmost frequently attacked lepidopteran families,\nGeometridae (48\u201362 MYA; mid Eocene to mid Paleocene\n[25]) and Noctuidae (60.7 to 113.4 MYA; mid Paleocene\nto mid Cretaceous [24]). Species of the remaining roga-\ndine tribes often attack members of various basal ditrysian\nfamilies (i.e. microlepidopterans), and thus their origins\nalso are considerably more recent than those estimated for\ntheir hosts.\nThe short internal branches and low support for several of\nthe relationships within the subgenus Aleiodes, which\ncomprises most of the known diversity within the genus\nsuggests a rapid radiation, although other factors, such as\nlower phylogenetic signal may also explain this pattern\n[26,27]. The inclusion of additional markers should help\nto clarify whether there has been a rapid radiation within\nthe group. A rapid radiation has also been proposed\nwithin Braconidae for the microgastrine group of genera\n(40\u201350 MYA; [28]).\nEvolution of mummification and emergence \ncharacteristics\nThe lack of host records and\/or preserved host mummies\nfor several rogadine genera, as well as our failure to\nrecover some key relationships (e.g. placement of Clinoc-\nentrini), prevent us from drawing strong conclusions\nabout the evolution of mummification characteristics\nwithin the subfamily. However, whether Clinocentrini is\nthe sister group to the Rogadini + Stiropiini clade or the\nsister group of the remaining rogadine tribes, a weak hard-\nening of the mummy is most likely to be the ancestral con-\ndition for the subfamily. Producing a hard mummy could\nhave evolved repeatedly in separate lineages, though this\ncondition is mainly found in species of the Aleiodini. AnPage 12 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329anterior site of emergence from the mummified host\nwould be the most plausible ancestral state if the Clinoc-\nentrini is confirmed as the sister group of the remaining\nrogadine tribes.\nThe dorsal emergence from the mummified host observed\nin all examined species of Stiropiini, Yeliconini and Alei-\nodini presumably occurs in response to the avoidance of\nphysical obstruction at other orientations. In the Sti-\nropiini this may occur because the host is prepupal in a\ncocoon ventrally attached to a hard substrate, and in Yeli-\nconini because the prepupal mummy itself is curved\nunder at both extremities [8]. The particular shift to\nexactly posterodorsal emergence in members of Aleiodini\nmight be associated with the anteroventral fixing of the\nmummy (typically formed from an only partly grown cat-\nerpillar) to a hard substrate, which creates a barrier to\nemergence through the mummy's more contracted and\nharder anterior end.\nThis presumably derived feature is retained in the Alei-\nodini even in species that (apparently secondarily) have\nadopted a mummification procedure that avoids this\nsource of obstruction (e.g. A. pallidator, which produces a\nloose mummy in a host-produced roomy silk chamber;\nand species of the 'suspended mummy' clade within Alei-\nodes s. s. [9]). Posterodorsal emergence orientations are\nalso retained in the few gregarious species of Aleiodes [8],\nin marked contrast with the more chaotic emergence seen\nin gregarious genera of Rogadini s. s. such as Colastomion\nand Macrostomion [8,29]. On the other hand, in the spe-\ncies of the Clinocentrini and most Rogadini s. s. the host\nis killed in its cocoon (albeit sometimes precocious in\nClinocentrus [2]), with typically no radial impediment,\nand consequently the emergence position shows no\ndorso-ventral restriction, but rather appears to occur more\nor less at random. However, in Rogas, in which the config-\nuration of the prepupal mummy positions the host head\ncapsule ventrally, and in Triraphis, in which the part grown\nlarval mummy is attached ventrally to a substrate, dorsal\nemergence is seen.\nThe degree of hardening of the mummy produced by\nrogadine species from their host's integument appears to\nowe much to the need for protection of the parasitoid\nmetamorphosing within it bearing in mind that there will\nbe a cost in providing it. The known hosts of the Sti-\nropiini, Clinocentrini, Yeliconini and most members of\nthe Rogadini are killed as prepupae, i.e. in prepared pupa-\ntion sites, which probably offers substantial protection to\nthe parasitoid larvae and, especially when emergence is\nrapid, little selection for the mummy to be especially\nhard. Thus, relatively frail and pale-coloured mummies\nare normal. A revealing exception is seen in the European\nspecies Triraphis tricolor (Wesmael), whose part grown\nhost mummies are either fixed naked to a tree leaf and\nemerge rapidly, when they are pale greenish yellow and\nrelatively frail, or fall from the leaf to overwinter on the\nground, in which case they are very well-tanned, dark\nbrown and tough (MRS, unpublished data).\nMost known hosts of the Aleiodini, on the other hand, are\nkilled during early larval instars, and lack the protection of\nthe host's pupation site, with the result that the mummy\nitself plays a more important role. Thus, the mummies of\nthese species are usually toughened and often strongly\ndarkened, whether or not the parasitoid diapauses in\nthem.\nEvolution of host ranges\nUse of microlepidopteran hosts was generally recovered\nby the MP and Bayesian methods as the ancestral condi-\ntion for both the Rogadinae and the Rogadini + Stiropiini\nclade. Thus, our results suggest that a shift from attacking\nsemi-concealed microlepidopteran to exposed microlepi-\ndopteran (Zygaenoidea) or macrolepidopteran host taxa\nhas independently evolved in various lineages within the\nRogadinae.\nOur ancestral reconstruction of host ranges and diver-\ngence time estimates contradict Fortier and Shaw's [18]\nhypothesis of coevolution between Aleiodes s. l. and its\nlepidopteran hosts. Based on their morphological esti-\nmate of phylogeny, they suggested that putatively basal\nmacrolepidopteran families (non-catocaline Noctuidae,\nSphingidae, Notodontinae) are attacked by basal species\nof Aleiodes, whilst the most derived hosts ('trifine' Noctui-\ndae) are attacked by derived parasitoid taxa. In our molec-\nular phylogenetic estimate, however, Fortier and Shaw's\n[18] supposedly derived A. dispar and A. gasterator species\ngroups appear instead, with significant support, to be at\nthe base of Aleiodini, and most of the species belonging\nto their proposed basal A. circumscriptus, A. pallidator, A.\ngastritor, and A. compressor groups are recovered in derived\nclades.\nOur results are more congruent with Shaw's [4,7] host\necology hypothesis that explains the apparently rapid\nradiation in Aleiodes s. s. In this hypothesis, the species of\nAleiodes s. l. that broaden their host range by recruitment\nof new hosts, sometimes from additional lepidopteran\nfamilies, promote subsequent radiation within the group.\nIn contrast, other species of Aleiodes remain tied to phylo-\ngenetically restricted host taxa and so have less tendency\nto radiate. In our molecular phylogeny, the most basal\nclades (Heterogamus, the species assigned to the subgenus\nArcaleiodes and the A. gasterator and other species groups\nof Fortier and Shaw [18] corresponding to the subgenus\nChelonorhogas sensu van Achterberg [13]), indeed do not\nappear to be particularly species rich and seem to bePage 13 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329mostly restricted to attacking only Noctuidae, though the\nhosts of Heterogamus and the subgenus Arcaleiodes remain\nunknown (old published records, cf. [30] repeated in For-\ntier and Shaw [18], are almost certainly erroneous and\nhave never been repeated). In contrast, the intermediate\nand derived clades (subgenus Aleiodes sensu van Achter-\nberg [13]) comprise most of the species diversity within\nthe genus and exhibit a wide host range overall [7]. Within\nthis, specialist use of microlepidoptera taxa such as Zyg-\naena (Zygaenidae), Ypsolopha (Ypsolophidae) and some\nPterophoridae, occurs infrequently, the species using\nthese hosts apparently being very closely related to species\nthat parasitise macrolepidoptera including morphologi-\ncally similar species in similar feeding niches (MRS,\nunpubl. data). Thus, the use of microlepidoptera by Alei-\nodes appears to be secondary. Moreover, in temperate\nwestern European species (the biologically best known),\nthe expansions of host range that have been hypothesised\n[4,7] to lead to speciation seem often to occur in species\nhaving more than one generation a year, which often use\ndifferent and sometimes not closely related hosts succes-\nsively. This plurivoltinism with 'discontinuous' host\nranges as defined by Shaw [7] is seen much more fre-\nquently in species of the subgenus Aleiodes than in the\nsubgenus Chelonorhogas. Members of the latter are mostly\nunivoltine and have 'continuous' host ranges.\nMethods\nTaxon sampling\nOur taxon sampling consisted of sequences from 34 gen-\nera and 118 species belonging to the previously recog-\nnised rogadine tribes Clinocentrini (4 genera, 4 spp.),\nStiropiini (3 genera, 3 spp.), Yeliconini (sensu Belokobyl-\nskij et al. [17]; 5 genera, 10 spp.), and Rogadini (22 gen-\nera, 101 spp.). Within the Rogadini, the species-rich genus\nAleiodes was represented by a total of 48 species. Our selec-\ntion of the Aleiodes species included members from 13 of\nthe 17 species-groups proposed by Fortier and Shaw [18]\nbased on a morphological phylogenetic analysis that\ncomprised 208 species. The species groups not repre-\nsented in our study were the A. gressitti (Muesebeck), A.\nprocerus Wesmael, A. pulchripes Wesmael and A. ufei\nWalley groups. Our species sampling also represents van\nAchterberg's [13] three proposed subgenera, Aleiodes\nWesmael, Chelonorhogas Enderlein and Neorhogas Sz\u00e9p-\nligeti. We also included a specimen assigned to the subge-\nnus Arcaleiodes Chen & He (sensu Belokobyslkij [31]),\nwhich was originally described as a separate genus [15].\nMoreover, we included a species belonging to the more\nrecently erected pilosus species-group [= Tetrasphaeropyx\nAshmead [32]] and 6 described and 15 undescribed mor-\nphologically diverse Aleiodes species without species-\ngroup assignation. Among these are four Afrotropical spe-\ncies (A. mubfsi Quicke & Shaw, A. barnardae Quicke &\nShaw, A. travelyanae Quicke & Shaw, and A. sp. 7) charac-\nterised by leaving their mummified hosts suspended\n(known in three cases; unknown for A. sp. 7), which\nappear to form a separate species group probably related\nto the Asian A. buzurae He & Chen [9].\nMonophyly of the Rogadinae was tested by adding 40 ter-\nminal taxa belonging to most of the currently recognised\ncyclostome braconid subfamilies. In particular, our out-\ngroup sampling emphasised the small subfamilies Betylo-\nbraconinae, Lysiterminae, and Hormiinae, which appear\nto be closely related to the Rogadinae according to previ-\nous molecular [16] and morphological [5,33] phyloge-\nnetic analyses. All the recovered trees were rooted using\nMesostoa kerri Austin & Wharton, of Mesostoinae. A Mes-\nostoinae + Aphidiinae clade has been consistently recov-\nered in previous studies as the sister group of the\nremaining cyclostomes [16,34]. The Aphidiinae was not\nrepresented in our study because the species of this group\ndisplay marked sequence length variation in the\nsequenced 28S gene fragment, which considerably affects\nthe length of the unambiguously aligned positions in the\nmatrix.\nThe taxa examined, their localities and voucher and\nEMBL\/GenBank accession numbers are listed in Addi-\ntional file 1.\nMolecular data\nThe gene markers analysed comprised a ~650 bp fragment\nof the second and third domain regions of the nuclear 28S\nrRNA gene, and a 602 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxi-\ndase I (COI) mitochondrial DNA gene. Most of the\nsequences analysed were newly generated for this study,\nbut some were previously published elsewhere by us (see\nAdditional file 1). We also retrieved from GenBank the\n28S sequence of A. (Arcaleiodes)aglaurus [15]. Genomic\nDNA was extracted from alcohol-preserved specimens and\nfrom dry-mounted material up to 15 years old. Detailed\ninformation on the DNA extraction and PCR protocols\nemployed, primers selected and sequencing procedure of\nPCR products is given in Zald\u00edvar-River\u00f3n et al. [16].\nSequence alignment\nBoth 28S and COI sequences were aligned by eye. COI\nalignment was confirmed by reference to the translated\namino acid sequence. The sequence length variable 28S\nfragments were aligned following the braconid secondary\nstructure model of Gillespie et al. [19]. The ambiguously\naligned regions detected were further identified and char-\nacterised according to the categories proposed by\nGillespie [35]. Unfortunately, the vast number of terminal\ntaxa together with the extensive variation observed within\nmost of the detected 28S unalignable regions precluded us\nfrom implementing the approach for recoding such\nregions proposed by Zald\u00edvar-River\u00f3n et al. [16]. Thus, thePage 14 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/32911 unalignable regions that were delimited in our 28S\nalignment were excluded from the subsequent analyses.\nThe 28S + COI matrix showing the braconid secondary\nstructure model followed for the 28S sequences is given in\nAdditional file 2. The above matrix and its resulting Baye-\nsian topology can also be retrieved from the TreeBase web\npage (http:\/\/www.treebase.org; study accession number\nS2223).\nPhylogenetic analyses\nSeparate and simultaneous analyses were carried out for\nthe 28S and COI data sets using the mixed-model Baye-\nsian MCMC method as implemented in MrBayes version\n3.1.2 [36]. Congruence between the two data sets was\nassessed by detecting the significantly supported clades\n[posterior probability (PP) \u2265 0.95] that were in conflict\nbetween the two separate analyses [37,38].\nAll the Bayesian analyses were run for 30 million genera-\ntions in Bioportal (University of Oslo; https:\/\/\nwww.bioportal.uio.no\/). Each analysis consisted of two\nsearches, sampling trees every 1000 generations and using\nfour chains and default priors. The model of evolution\nselected for the two data sets was the GTR+I+\u0393, which was\ndetermined based on the Akaike criterion implemented in\nMrModeltest version 2.0 [39]. Five different partitions\nwere considered for the analyses, two for the stem and\nloop 28S regions, respectively, and the three remaining for\nthe COI codon positions. Burn-in is usually determined\nby stationarity of the likelihoods of the trees sampled,\nwhich is usually reached quickly. This practice, however,\nmay not work so well for large data sets, where the appro-\npriate sampling of the posterior distribution of the tree\ntopologies might take considerably longer [40]. We there-\nfore took advantage of our large analyses and determined\nthe duration of the relevant burn-in phases based on the\nconstancy of the PPs for the 20 more unstable clades using\nthe online program AWTY [41]. Based on this conserva-\ntive criterion, the burn-in phase in all analyses was deter-\nmined to be after 20 million generations. We then\ncompared the topologies and PPs obtained in the two\nindependent searches run for the separate and combined\nanalyses. The independent searches were congruent in\ntheir topologies and PP clade values in the three analyses,\nand thus majority rule consensus trees (including compat-\nible groups) of their pooled post burn-in trees were esti-\nmated. We considered clades as significantly supported if\nthey had a PP \u2265 0.95 [42].\nA Bayesian approach for hypothesis testing [38,43,44]\nwas carried out to test the following hypotheses that were\nabsent in the majority rule consensus tree derived from\nthe simultaneous analysis of the two gene fragments: 1)\nmonophyletic Triraphis Nees (sensu Valerio [22]), 2)\nmonophyletic Aleiodes (including the species of the sub-\ngenera Chelonorhogas, Neorhogas, Aleiodes and Arcaleiodes\nand the species previously considered as Heterogamus, but\nexcluding Pholichora and Heterogamus), 3) monophyletic\nRogadini (sensu van Achterberg [13]), and 4) mono-\nphyletic Rogadina (considering Cornutorogas Chen,\nBelokobylskij, Achterberg & Whitfield and Batothecoides\nWatanabe as members of Spinariina, see results). A\ndetailed explanation of how this Bayesian approach was\nimplemented can be found in Zald\u00edvar-River\u00f3n et al. [45].\nDivergence dates of clades\nThe molecular dating of selected clades was estimated\nusing two different relaxed molecular clock approaches:\nthe semiparametric penalised likelihood (PL; Sanderson,\n2002) and the Bayesian relaxed phylogenetics (RP [46])\nmethods.\nThe PL method was performed with r8s version 1.7 [47].\nThe range, mean and standard deviation for PL were\nobtained taking the last 50 trees (with their branch\nlengths) sampled from each of the two independent\nMrBayes runs (with 28S and COI combined; see above).\nThe truncated Newton algorithm was used, and a cross\nvalidation [48] was first run on the majority rule consen-\nsus tree from the simultaneous Bayesian analysis to deter-\nmine the optimal value of smoothing, which turned out\nto be 10. Aspilodemon Fischer was deleted from the trees\nexamined to give a basal node separating Mesostoa Austin\n& Wharton from the clade with the remaining terminal\ntaxa. The following terminal taxa were pruned from the\ntrees in order to avoid near zero branch lengths: A. sp.\nnear borealis (Thomson), A. gasterator (Jurine), A. cf. gastri-\ntor (Thunberg), A. pictus (Herrich-Sch\u00e4ffer), A. praetor\n(Reinhard), A. ruficornis (Herrich-Sch\u00e4ffer), A. similis\n(Curtis), A. (Heterogamus) sp. 2, A. spp 3, 9, and 10, Bul-\nborogas sp. 1, Canalirogas sp. 1, Colastomion concolor (Sz\u00e9p-\nligeti) specimen 2, species of Conspinaria Schulz except C.\nsp. 4, Darnilia sp. 2, Gyroneuronella sp., Macrostomion sp. 2,\nRogas spp. 6 and 10, and species of Spinaria Brull\u00e9 except\nS. albiventris Cameron and S. sp.\nThe RP method was performed using BEAST [49]. The\ndata set was partitioned in four sets: 28S, and the first, sec-\nond and third codon positions of COI. The same model\nof nucleotide substitution was used for each of these par-\ntitions: GTR+I+\u0393 (selected by MrModeltest; see above).\nBase frequencies were estimated by BEAST, and the\nnumber of categories for the gamma distribution was\nfour. We included the same set of 129 taxa that we used\nfor the PL method. The relaxed molecular clock model\nchosen was uncorrelated lognormal. The starting tree was\nobtained with PAUP* using Maximum Parsimony [50]\nand later linearised with r8s [47] with a tree height of 93\nMYA (see below). We ran each analysis for 100 million\ngenerations in eight separate runs, and with a samplingPage 15 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329frequency of 1\/10,000 generations. Given the size of the\nresultant files, and to make sure that the sampled chains\nwere stable, we discarded the first 80 million generations\nof each run (burn-in), which was more than enough\naccording to what the chain inspector software Tracer v1.4\n[51] suggested. We include the Beast files as Additional\nfiles 3 and 4.\nFossil ages and node calibration\nThe correct identification of fossil taxa and an adequate\nselection of calibration nodes are two of the most critical\nsteps in molecular dating estimation [52]. We fixed the\nmost basal node and set two or three different calibration\npoints based on the fossil taxa discussed below, which\nwere selected after a detailed examination of a number of\ndescriptions of cyclostome fossils. Several other cyclos-\ntome fossils have been described from different geological\nperiods [53], but unfortunately the generic assignations\nfor many of them are either incorrect or questionable.\nThe most basal node representing the cyclostome group\nwas fixed in the PL and RP analyses using the age of Proto-\nrhyssalus goldmani Basibuyuk, Rasnitsyn, Achterberg, Fit-\nton & Quicke [93 million years ago (MYA) [23]]. An\napparently closely related fossil, Protorhyssalodes arnaudi\nPerrichot, Nel & Quicke, of very similar age has been\nrecently confirmed to be a cyclostome and is the oldest\nconfirmed member of this group that has been found to\ndate (Perrichot, Nel and Quicke, submitted).\nThe MRCA of Aivalykus Nixon was calibrated based on the\nfossil of A. dominicanus Zuparko & Poinar [54], which has\nan age of 15\u201320 MYA according to the estimated age of the\nDominican amber [55]. Three species of Aivalykus were\nincluded in the analyses in order to have a better represen-\ntation of the oldest lineage within this genus. The MRCA\nof Aivalykus was calibrated with a minimum age of 15\nMYA in the PL analyses, whereas in the RP analyses this\nwas constrained to a normal prior distribution with a\nlower bound of 15 MYA (5%) and a higher bound of 20\nMYA (95%). We chose a normal distribution to reflect the\nsimilar probability of the two bounds, and also to account\nfor the uncertainty associated with the long branch sus-\ntaining the node of Aivalykus' MRCA. That is, the dated\nfossil might be from a time point considerably older than\nAivalykus' MRCA because of the long branch previous to\nthis MRCA (Figure 4), and therefore Aivalykus' MRCA\ncould not only be older than the fossil, as is always the\ncase due to the paucity of the fossil record, but also\nyounger.\nWe also selected the fossil ages of three rogadine species\nthat were described from the Baltic amber [56], Clinocen-\ntrus latitator Brues, C. latipennis Brues, and Rhogas (=\nRogas)fritschii Brues. Unfortunately, these fossils were\ndestroyed during the Second World War and thus we\ncould not confirm the correct assignation of these taxa. A\ndetailed inspection of the original descriptions and the\nFigures presented therein suggest the correct assignation\nof the two first species within Clinocentrus, though they\nshow some atypical features that are absent in the extant\nspecies of the genus. In the case of the fossil specimen\nassigned to Rogas, its description unambiguously places it\nwithin the Rogadinae but does not help to confirm its\ngeneric assignation because is not clear whether it has the\nonly known external morphological feature known to dis-\ntinguish Rogas from Aleiodes sensu van Achterberg [13], i.e.\ntarsal claws with a basal lobe present. However, an exam-\nination of Brues' descriptions of other species assigned by\nhim to Rhogas revealed that his concept of the genus was\nan idea (prevalent at the time) that encompassed Aleiodes\nsensu van Achterberg [13]. For instance, R. bakeri Brues\nand R. ecuadoriensis Brues have been subsequently reclas-\nsified as Aleiodes [57,58]. Moreover, according to Brues'\n(1933) description, some of the morphological features\npresent in R. fritschii (e.g. ovipositor very short, antennae\nwith only 25 segments, though most extant species have\nconsiderably more flagellomeres than this) appear to dif-\nfer from the currently accepted concept of Rogas, but are\nmore similar to the ones displayed by Aleiodes sensu van\nAchterberg (1991). Thus, it seems likely that the above\nspecimen belongs to Aleiodes sensu van Achterberg [13]\nand not to Rogas. We therefore performed the PL and RP\nanalyses including the calibration ages estimated for the\nBaltic amber to set the MRCAs of Clinocentrini and the\nAleiodes clade (i.e. Aleiodini; see results), and including\nthem to set the MRCA of Clinocentrini alone.\nThe age of the Baltic amber was originally proposed by\nKaplan et al. [59] to be of 37.7 \u00b1 3 MYA based on the abso-\nlute age of the Prussian Formation, though it was subse-\nquently changed by Ritzowski [60], who inferred for this\namber a Middle Eocene age (44.1 \u00b1 1 MYA) based on radi-\nometrically dated glauconite. The latter age estimate was\nemployed in a recent phylogenetic analysis among the\nmicrogastroid genera [61]; however, it has been consid-\nered as doubtful by Perkovsky et al. [62] because it was\ncalculated based on an insufficient layer sampling. We\nthus followed a conservative approach and set the MRCA\nof Clinocentrus Haliday to have a minimum age of 34.7\nMYA in the PL analyses. Given the uncertainties associated\nwith the fossil of Aleiodes s. l., we did two separate analyses\nfor the RP approach: including and excluding Aleiodini's\ncalibration. We used the same prior distribution for the\nage of both Aleiodini and Clinocentrus MRCAs, an expo-\nnential distribution with a minimum age of 34.7 MYA\nand a 45.1 MYA upper bound (95% limit). We chose an\nexponential distribution with a zero offset of 34.7 to\nreflect our higher confidence in this value than in the 45.1\nMYA upper bound.Page 16 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/329\nPage 17 of 20\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPhotographs of Rogadinae mummiesFigure 7\nPhotographs of Rogadinae mummies.

Reconstruction of ancestral states with the\nMP method was performed mapping each character onto\nour preferred Bayesian phylogeny with MacClade version\n4.0 [63]. Bayesian ancestral reconstructions of selected\nclades were carried with Bayestraits version 1.0 [64,65];\nhttp:\/\/www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk), mapping each character\nonto a posterior distribution represented by the last 250\ntopologies sampled from the two independent searches\n(500 topologies in total) run for the simultaneous Baye-\nsian analysis. Two searches of 10 million iterations each\nwere run for each character, sampling a reconstruction of\nancestral states every 500 iterations. We used a gamma-\ndistributed hyperprior of the transition probabilities\nbetween states (rjhp exp 0.0 30) and a deviation rate of\nthe normal distribution of 2.0. Burn-in was determined to\nbe after 300,000 generations.
