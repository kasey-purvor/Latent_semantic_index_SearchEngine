One area where this problem is particularly prevalent is \ninternational terrorism. According to Huntington, international terrorism is contagious \nbecause of civilizational rallying effects. If radical groups from one country attack targets \nfrom a country of another civilization, then groups from other countries of the same \ncivilization as the initial terrorist groups will become more likely to also attack this target. \nAny test of this hypothesis has to solve Galton\u2019s problem and thus to disentangle spatial \ndependence from spatial clustering of attacks and common shocks and trends, which affect \nsimilar groups from different countries similarly. Accounting for such potentially \nconfounding effects, we nevertheless find evidence for spatial dependence in international \nterrorism along civilizational lines in the post-Cold War period and particularly so for specific \ninter-civilizational combinations. However, while contagion consistent with Huntington\u2019s \npredictions exists, spatial dependence seems to have a substantively small effect on patterns \nof international terrorism. \n3 \n1. Introduction \nTerrorist attacks are unlikely to be independent of each other (Midlarsky et al. 1980; \nHamilton and Hamilton 1983; Drakos and Gofas 2006; Braithwaite and Li 2007). If a terrorist \ngroup conducts a successful terrorist attack, it will more likely attempt to launch similar \nattacks in the future. Single groups thus often conduct what is known as \u2018terror campaigns\u2019, \nwhich leads to temporal dependence in attacks. Similarly, different groups pursue similar \ngoals or compete with each other for attention and support.1 As a consequence, they are likely \nto choose similar strategies. Again, terrorist attacks are contagious, this time leading to spatial \ndependence. \nWhile terrorism can thus be contagious for very different reasons, Samuel Huntington \n(1996) has suggested the arguably most prominent explanation for spatial dependence in \ninternational terrorism. According to Huntington (1993a, 1993b, 1996), civilizational rallying \neffects draw individuals and extremist groups from different countries but the same \ncivilization into conducting attacks on targets from a country of another civilization if other \ngroups from the same civilization attack victims from this country. If this holds, then a \nterrorist attack from a, say, Pakistani group on British targets should increase the probability \nof other Islamic groups also attacking British targets. \nYet, researchers must be careful in interpreting spatially related terrorist attacks from \nsimilar groups on the same target as evidence for implicit coalition formation between \nterrorist groups. In fact, similar terrorist attacks could also be caused by an increase in \ncompetition between terrorist groups which compete for scarce support and attention. This \nwould also lead to spatial dependence in terrorist attacks, but for very different reasons than \nrallying. Likewise, spatial clustering may also occur when groups face similar underlying \nincentives. In this case, terrorist groups may act perfectly independent from each other, but \n                                                 \n1\n  Elsewhere, we discussed this logic in greater detail. See Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer (2010b) and Neumayer \nand Pl\u00fcmper (2010a). \n4 \nresearchers could erroneously interpret their findings as evidence for spatial dependence. \nClearly, if one individual opens an umbrella after another has already done so, the reason is \nunlikely to be any contagious effect in the use of umbrellas but simply the fact that it rains. \nLikewise, if two terror groups conduct similar attacks they may well respond to the same \nincentives for doing so rather than trying to support each other. If terrorist groups spatially \ndepend on each other, then one group attacks a particular target because another group has \nalready attacked the same target. If, however, spatial patterns result from spatial clustering or \ncommon shocks and trends, then two similar groups attack the same target because they are \nindependently stimulated by the same incentive structure or change in incentive structure. \nSocial scientists know the apparent observational similarity between the consequences of \ncommon trends and shocks as well as spatial clustering on the one hand and the consequences \nof spatial dependency on the other as Galton\u2019s (1889) problem. If either spatial clustering or \ncommon shocks and trends are not adequately modeled, then an analysis might spuriously \nsuggest spatial dependence. In other words, the challenge is to identify the true spatial \ndependence effect. Identification rests on the assumption that all the spatial pattern of the \ndependent variable that has nothing to do with spatial dependence itself is fully explained by \nthe independent variables other than the spatial lag. This is a strong assumption and if it does \nnot hold then the estimated coefficients for the variables capturing the spatial dependence \neffects are likely to be biased. \nIn this paper, we use model specification techniques for the analysis of spatial \ndependence, which we have discussed in greater detail elsewhere (Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer \n2010a), to separate spatial dependence from spatial clustering and common shocks and trends. \nAs a first step, we include civilization dyad-specific dummy variables into our analysis to \ncontrol for spatial clustering in the levels of international terrorism. Put simply, these controls \naccount for the fact that some civilizational combinations have a higher a priori propensity to \nexperience international terrorism even after controlling for the confounding variables and in \n5 \nthe absence of any spatial spillover effects. We will then, additionally, include civilization \ndyad-specific time trends to control for spatial clustering in the changes of international \nterrorism. These account for the fact that some civilizational combinations are more prone to \nexperience increases or decreases in international terrorism over time. All specifications \ninclude year-specific time dummy variables to account for changes in terror propensity over \ntime common to all dyads. All models also include time-varying variables capturing the \ngeneral terror propensity of both potential terror and potential target countries. \nWe conduct two types of analyses: first, we try to identify general inter-civilizational \nrallying effects, distinguishing between the Cold War and the post-Cold War period. \nAccording to Huntington, a rallying effect occurs in the latter but not in the former period. \nAnd second, we focus on three inter-civilizational combinations, which Huntington identifies \nas particularly prone to international terrorism, namely the clashes between non-Western and \nthe Western civilizations, between the Islamic and non-Islamic civilizations and, particularly, \nbetween the Islamic and the Western civilizations. \nOur results provide support for the general rallying hypothesis in the post-Cold War \nperiod. The more stringent we control for confounding factors, the smaller the estimated \ncoefficient of the spatial lag variable capturing the civilizational rallying effect becomes, but \nit remains statistically significant throughout. If, additionally, we condition the spatial lag \nvariables on the three inter-civilizational combinations identified by Huntington, then we also \nfind evidence suggesting the existence of rallying effects in the post-Cold War period. \nHowever, in substantive terms these spatial spillover effects are relatively modest. While \nexistent, they therefore do not seem to play an important role in determining patterns of \ninternational terrorism. \nOur paper contributes to two important, yet separate literatures. First, we contribute to \nthe rapidly growing literature on international terrorism by analyzing whether international \nterrorist events are contagious along civilizational lines. Second, we also show the importance \n6 \nof correctly identifying spatial dependence by accounting for spatial clustering, common \nshocks and common trends. Our analysis demonstrates how failure to control for confounding \nfactors leads to an overestimation of spatial dependence. While our analysis is on patterns of \ninternational terrorism, it is likely to have relevance in many other areas of social science \nresearch as well.  \n \n2. Civilizational Rallying and International Terrorism \nAt first glance, data on international terrorist incidents seemingly lend support to the potential \nexistence of civilizational rallying effects. Table 1 lists the number of terror incidents for each \nyear from 1968 to 2005, together with a breakdown into terror incidents that are intra-\ncivilizational (terrorists and victims belong to the same civilization) and inter-civilizational \n(terrorists and victims belong to different civilizations). Interestingly, a large share and in \nmany years even the majority of international terrorism is inter-civilizational. Also, the share \nof inter-civilizational terror incidents seems to have increased after the end of the Cold War. \nData reported in Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2009, tables 2 and 3) show that Westerners are the \nmain target of inter-civilizational terrorism in general as well as of Islamic terrorists in \nparticular and that the Islamic civilization is the most prone to inter-civilizational terrorism. \n7 \nTable 1.

Based on his broader argument that individuals, groups, and \ngovernments primarily identify themselves and are identified by others as belonging to a \nparticular civilization, he argues that the conflict between a terrorist group from one \n8 \ncivilization and countries from another civilization draws in other groups from the same \ncivilization as the terrorists. Huntington (1993a: 38) accepts that \u201ccivilization rallying to date \nhas been limited\u201d, but he maintains that \u201cit has been growing, and it clearly has the potential \nto spread much further.\u201d \nWhile Huntington argues that after the end of the Cold War \u201cthe principal conflicts of \nglobal politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations\u201d (Huntington \n1993a: 22), i.e. by the clash of civilizations, he is not very clear on what exactly he means by \nthe term clash (Bassin 2007). Apparently, many forms of violent conflict are subsumed under \nthe umbrella notion of clash. Importantly from the perspective of this article, Huntington \nregards terrorism as one important form of clash, used particularly by the weaker side in inter-\ncivilizational clashes: \u201cterrorism historically is the weapon of the weak\u201d (Huntington 1996: \n187). He makes specific predictions about the relative propensity of civilizations to use \nterrorism in their conflict with other civilizations. Specifically, he suggests the excessive use \nof terrorism in the conflict between non-Western civilizations and the West, between the \nIslamic and non-Islamic civilizations and, particularly, between Islam and the West \n(Huntington 1996: 188, 263ff.; Huntington 2002). To do justice to Huntington\u2019s paradigm, in \nthis article we will test the two hypotheses that after the end of the Cold War international \nterrorism is contagious along civilizational lines in general as well as that it is contagious for \nthe specific inter-civilizational combinations identified by Huntington as most prone to the \nuse of this particular form of conflict. \n \n3. Variables, Estimation Technique and Sample \nIn this section, we describe the dependent and control variables. In the following section, we \nwill discuss in some detail the model specification techniques that allow us to deal with \nGalton\u2019s problem by disentangling spatial dependence from spatial clustering, common \nshocks and common time trends. \n9 \n \nDependent Variable \nOur source for data on international terrorism is the \u201cInternational Terrorism: Attributes of \nTerrorist Events\u201d (Iterate) dataset (Mickolus et al. 2003). It defines terror as \u201cthe use, or \nthreat of use, of anxiety-inducing, extra-normal violence for political purposes by any \nindividual or group, whether acting for or in opposition to established governmental authority, \nwhen such action is intended to influence the attitudes and behaviour of a target group wider \nthan the immediate victims\u201d (ibid.: 2). Acts of terror include, among others, assassinations, \nbombings and armed attacks, arson and fire, kidnapping, and skyjacking, unless they are acts \nof ordinary crime or the violence is for purposes other than political (e.g., for drug trafficking \npurposes), and unless the violence is committed during international and civil wars. Attacks \nby guerrilla groups are only included if they inflict damage on civilian targets or the \ndependents of military personnel (Mickolus, Sandler and Murdock 1989: xii). Iterate is a very \ncomprehensive database that codes, amongst others, the nationality of both terrorists and the \nvictims of their attacks. The unit of observation in our sample is the directed country dyad \nyear and our dependent variable is the annual sum of terrorist incidents originating from a \nspecific country on targets from another specific country. It does not matter where the act of \nterrorism took place, whether in the terrorists\u2019, victims\u2019 or a third country. \nTo be on the conservative side, we do not include terrorism committed by \u201cIndeterminate \nArabs, Palestine\u201d, since we cannot allocate these to a specific country. Our results are, \nhowever, robust to allocating each of these terror attacks to a randomly drawn Arab country. \nUsing nationality to determine the civilizational belonging of terrorists and victims can, at \ntimes, be misleading. In the 7\/7 attacks on the London Underground system, for example, the \nterrorists were Muslims with British citizenship, which would fail to be included as inter-\ncivilizational terrorism, even though it may qualify as such given the apparent Islamist and \nanti-Western motivations of the terrorists. Such measurement error is likely to bias the results \n10 \nagainst finding evidence for Huntington\u2019s predictions. However, our test for changes in \nspillover effects after the end of the Cold War is likely to be affected less, unless such \napparent measurement error has become stronger during the post-Cold War period. We \nexclude terror attacks on Israeli targets or perpetrated by Israeli terrorists. This is because, \nfirst, Israel is one of those cases in which it is not clear how Huntington classifies the \ncivilizational belonging.2 Second, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as well as \nArab nations is very peculiar and its inclusion would risk biasing our results. Our results are, \nhowever, fully robust to including attacks from Israeli terrorists and attacks on Israeli targets. \n \nControl Variables \nAs structural determinants of international terrorism we include the log of per capita income, \nthe level of democracy and the logged population size of both the terrorists\u2019 origin country \nand the victims\u2019 target country. This follows arguments provided by Krueger and Laitin \n(2008) and Abadie (2006) on welfare and terrorism. Richer country targets are strategically \nmore attractive to terrorists, not least because such attacks generate greater media attention. \nPoorer countries may generate more terrorism, even though the link between per capita \nincome and a country\u2019s propensity to generate terrorist attacks is controversial. Democracies \nare said to suffer more from terrorism (Li 2005; Enders and Sandler 2006; Kydd and Walter \n2006), but the link between regime type in the terrorists\u2019 home country and international \nterrorism is again somewhat controversial (Li 2005). We also control for the population size \nof both countries to account for the simple fact that ceteris paribus more populous countries \nwill generate more terrorism and suffer more from terrorism. Data on income and population \nare taken from World Bank (2006), data on democracy from the Polity IV project \n                                                 \n2\n  In Russett, Oneal and Cox\u2019s (2000) classification Israel is part of the West, whereas in \nHenderson and Tucker\u2019s (2001) classification it is not part of the Western or any other \ncivilization. \n11 \n(http:\/\/www.cidcm.umd.edu\/polity\/). Lastly, we control for the fact that contiguity of two \ncountries as well as geographical proximity lowers the costs for terrorists to execute terror \nacts against foreign nationals. The natural log of the distance between the capital cities of two \ncountries and a dummy variable for contiguity by land or separation by sea of less than 150 \nmiles are taken from www.eugenesoftware.org. \nOne final complication that comes with the Iterate dataset is that it contains incidents in \nwhich the main nationality of the terrorists and the victims are the same. These nevertheless \ndo not represent purely domestic terrorism because some other aspect of the incident or its \nresolution transcends national boundaries and makes these incidents international, which is \nwhy they are included in Iterate. However, these are cases in which the distinction between \ninternational and domestic terrorism is somewhat blurred, which may amount to some form of \nmeasurement error. In the main estimations shown below, we control for this potential error \nby including a dummy variable that is set to one for all incidents in which the main nationality \nof the terrorists and their targets are the same. Our results are fully robust to not including \nsuch a dummy variable as well as robust to excluding all such incidents from the sample. In \nother words, this apparent source of bias does not have a significant effect on our results. \n \nEstimation technique and sample \nOur dependent variable is a count variable (number of terrorist incidents). To account for \nover-dispersion, which is very prominent in the data, we use a negative binomial model, \nwhich is more reliable than the Poisson model for this kind of data. We employ standard \nerrors adjusted for clustering on country dyads. Our sample covers annual observations over \nthe period 1970 to 2005 and up to 150 countries, which form what is called directed country \ndyads with each other such that each country is linked to each other country once as a \npotential home country of terrorists and once as a potential target country. Due to missing \n12 \ndata on the explanatory variables not all possible country dyads are included over the entire \nperiod. \nThe dependent variable has a large number of zeros. In such situations, researchers \nsometimes employ an estimation model known as the zero-inflated negative binomial model \nor an alternative model known as a hurdle model. Both models rest on problematic \nassumptions, however. The hurdle model combines a binary model to predict values of zero \nwith another, usually zero-truncated Poisson or zero-truncated negative binomial, model to \npredict non-zero values. Its underlying assumption is that different mechanisms account for \nzeros than for the distribution of non-zeros (Hilbe 2007). We doubt whether this estimation \nprocedure is consistent with the underlying data generating process of international terrorism. \nThe zero-inflated negative binomial model assumes that some dyad years do not experience \ninternational terrorism with probability of one (Long and Freese 2006) \u2013 which seems to be \ninconsistent with empirical evidence and for which there is no obvious theoretical justification \neither. \nThe inclusion of spatial lag variables necessarily introduces some endogeneity bias. The \nsame is true for variables controlling for the terror propensity of terror and target countries, \nwhich we include for reasons to be explained in the following section. Lagging the variables \nby one period can only very partially address the bias (our results are fully robust to lagging \nthese variables by one period). Fortunately, the endogeneity bias is likely to be small. Hays \nand Franzese (2009) suggest that using an estimation model in which ln(y+1) rather than y \nitself enters the spatial effect variable performs well in terms of bias and root mean squared \nerror. They demonstrate this result for Monte Carlo simulations using a Poisson estimator, but \nthe results should carry over to the negative binomial case. We therefore use ln(y+1) in the \ngeneration of the spatial effect and the terror propensity variables. \n13 \n4.  Disentangling Spatial Dependence from Spatial Clustering and Common Trends \nand Shocks  \nIn spatial econometrics, model specification is arguably even more important than in many \nother analyses. Failure to control for, for example, common shocks and trends in the data \ngenerating process has more severe consequences in spatial than in standard panel data \nanalysis since it directly affects the estimated coefficient for the spatial lag. Such failure will \ntypically cause largely biased coefficients of the spatial lag variables and can lead to wrong \ninferences. In this section, we explain model specification techniques that allow us to account \nfor Galton\u2019s problem. \n \nThe Spatial Lag Variable \nIn order to model spatial dependence, one needs to construct what is known as a spatial lag \nvariable. Such a variable consists of the dependent variable in other country dyads weighted \nby some weighting or connectivity matrix (Anselin 1988). In our case, the spatial lag variable \nconsists of the amount of terrorism in other dyads formed by the same specific target country \nwith other (potential) terrorist home countries, but only if the terrorist source countries of the \nother dyads belong to the same civilization as the source country in the country dyad under \nobservation, while the terror and the target country belong to different civilizations. In other \nwords, the connectivity or weighting matrix measures the civilizational belonging of the \nterrorist and target countries and is set to one if, simultaneously, the terrorist countries share \nthe same civilization, but a different civilization from the target country, and zero otherwise. \nInstead of merely counting current terror incidents in other countries, we use the sum of terror \nincidents of the current and prior two years for the creation of the spatial lag variable. The \nreason is that contagion may take some time as groups need to prepare terror attacks. \nFormally, let i stand for the source country of the (potential) terrorists and j for the target \ncountry of the (potential) victims. The \u2018civilizational rallying\u2019 variable represents what we \n14 \nhave dubbed specific source contagion elsewhere.3 It is the sum of all terror incidents in the \ncurrent and prior two years from all countries of the same civilization to which country i \nbelongs (minus terrorism of the specific country i that forms the dyadic unit of observation \nwith country j) on targets of the specific country j under observation, which is from another \ncivilization than i. Ignoring other control variables for the moment and keeping in mind that, \nfollowing Hays and Franzese (2009), we use ln(y+1) rather than y itself in the creation of the \nspatial lag variable, this can be expressed as: \n \n1\n2\nln( 1) ...\nt\nijt ik ijtkjm\nk i m t\ny w y\u03b2 \u03b5\n\u2260 = \u2212\n= + + +\u2211 \u2211  (1) \n \nwhere yijt is the number of terror attacks from terrorists of country i on targets from country j \nin year t. \n2\nln( 1)\nt\nik kjm\nk i m t\nw y\n\u2260 = \u2212\n+\u2211 \u2211  is the spatial lag variable that consists of two elements: a \nweighting matrix, symbolized by ikw , which is multiplied by the spillover or \u201cspatial y\u201d \nvariable, symbolized by \n2\nln( 1)\nt\nkjm\nm t\ny\n= \u2212\n+\u2211 . The \u201cspatial y\u201d is the natural log of one plus the sum \nof terror attacks by individuals from countries other than country i, called countries k, on \ntargets from the same target country j in this year and the prior two years. The weighting \nmatrix is set to one if, at the same time, country i and countries k belong to the same \ncivilization and country j belongs to a different civilization, and zero otherwise. 1\u03b2  is the \nestimated coefficient of the spatial lag variable, the dots stand for control variables and ijt\u03b5  is \nan error term. A positive 1\u03b2  that is statistically significantly different from zero would suggest \nthat terrorism by terrorists from country i on targets from country j of a different civilization \n                                                 \n3\n  See Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2010b) for a classification and discussion of all possible forms of \nmodeling spatial dependence in dyadic data. \n15 \nrises with higher terrorism by terrorists from other countries k of the same civilization as \ncountry i on targets of the same country j. For example, if terrorists from other Latin \nAmerican countries attack US citizens, then this might raise terrorism from Colombian \nterrorists on US citizens. \nTo create this spatial lag variable we need information on the civilizational belonging of \ncountries and their correct classification is clearly of great importance. Defining civilizations \nas \u201cthe highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people \nhave\u201d, being \u201cdifferentiated from each other by history, language, culture, tradition, and, most \nimportant, religion\u201d (ibid.: 25), Huntington identifies seven, or possibly eight, civilizations \u2013 \nWestern, Sinic, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and, possibly, \nAfrican. Unfortunately, he does not provide a clear list of the civilizational belonging of \ncountries in his work. Information has to be gathered indirectly from a map of countries of the \nworld, in which he has drawn civilizational information. This does not provide unambiguous \ninformation and critics have also noted that he is not entirely consistent in his verbal \ndescriptions on which country belongs to which civilization (Russett, Oneal and Cox\u2019s 2000; \nHenderson and Tucker 2001). We use Russett, Oneal and Cox\u2019s (2000) classification, but our \nresults are robust to using Henderson and Tucker\u2019s (2001) classification instead. \n \nModeling Spatial Clustering \nSpatial patterns in international terrorism do not need to be caused by spatial dependence. \nInstead, these patterns can be caused by spatial correlation in other factors influencing or \nstimulating the dependent variable. Observable as well as unobservable phenomena such as \ncontiguity and geographical distance, political cultures and customs, preferences and \nperceptions, constitutions and institutions, and so on are typically spatially clustered, which \n16 \ncan lead to spatial patterns in the dependent variable even in the absence of spatial \ndependence.4 \nA popular method for mitigating the problem created by spatial clustering is the inclusion \nof fixed effects. Such models take out all of the between variation in the data and are \nestimated based on the within variation of the data in each observational unit only. This \nreduces bias because any spatial clustering or unobserved spatial heterogeneity in terrorism \nlevels are fully captured by the fixed effects. However, the inclusion of fixed effects not only \nmakes the estimates less efficient (Pl\u00fcmper et al. 2005; Pl\u00fcmper and Troeger 2007), spatial \nclustering in changes in the level of terrorism may also still bias the estimates of the spatial \nlag and calls for the modeling of common shocks and common trends (Pl\u00fcmper and \nNeumayer 2010a), to which we turn further below. \nTo account for spatial clustering in inter-civilizational patterns of international terrorism, \nwe include civilization dyad-specific dummy variables into the estimation model. These \naccount for the fact that some pairs of civilizations are simply more prone to experience \ninternational terrorism even in the absence of any civilizational rallying effects. They also \nappropriately account for spatially clustered incentive structures common to inter-\ncivilizational combinations. In comparison, country dyad-specific fixed effects would remove \nall level effects in international terrorism from our estimates given that the unit of observation \nis the country dyad year. They would thus very likely capture some of the spatial dependence \nvia civilizational rallying effect that we seek to isolate from spatial clustering. Accordingly, \n                                                 \n4\n  Franzese and Hays (2008) discuss the source and nature of this problem in some detail. If the \ndeterminants of spatial patterns in the dependent variable are observed (i.e. the regressors show \nspatial patterns), one often refers to this as spatial clustering, whereas unobserved spatial \npatterns are usually called unobserved spatial heterogeneity (spatial patterns in errors). For the \npurpose of the analysis here, as a shortcut we mainly use the term spatial clustering to cover \nboth observed and unobserved spatial heterogeneity. \n17 \nthe inclusion of country dyad-specific fixed effects would probably lead us to under-estimate \nspatial dependence. In other words, the inclusion of civilization dyad-specific dummy \nvariables avoids an over-estimation of spatial dependence that would follow from failing to \naccount for spatial clustering, but also avoids the under-estimation of spatial dependence that \nwould follow from the inclusion of country dyad-specific fixed effects. \nFormally, the inclusion of civilization dyad-specific dummy variables leads us into \nextending equation (1) to: \n \n1\n2\nln( 1) ...\nt\nijt ik c ijtkjm\nk i m t\ny w uy\u03b2 \u03b5\n\u2260 = \u2212\n= + + + +\u2211 \u2211 , (2) \n \nwhere cu  are the time-invariant fixed effects, representing the 28 possible inter-civilizational \ncombinations. \n \nModeling Common Shocks and Common Trends \nThe problem of modeling common shocks and common trends is widely discussed in the \ntheoretical literature on spatial econometrics (e.g., Beck et al. 2006; Franzese and Hays 2007; \nPl\u00fcmper and Neumayer 2010a), and methodologists usually suggest that applied researchers \ncontrol for common trends by adding the lagged dependent variable to the list of regressors \n(e.g., Hays 2003, Franzese and Hays 2007, Swank 2006) and account for common shocks by \nadding period-specific time dummies (e.g. Bailey and Rom 2004; Franzese and Hays 2007). \nFollowing this advice, we include year-specific time dummy variables to account for common \nshocks. However, as concerns common trends we have chosen a different modeling option. \nFirst, we include a variable that measures the total annual sum of terrorism originating from \ncountry i (independent of the target country of the victims but minus the number of terror \nincidents in the dyad under observation) and another variable that measures the total annual \n18 \nsum of terrorism suffered by individuals from country j (independent of the origin or source \ncountry of the terrorists but, again, minus the number of incidents in the dyad under \nobservation). The purpose of these variables is to account for the general, but time-varying, \nterror propensity of terrorists\u2019 home and the target countries, respectively. As with the spatial \nlag variables, these variables enter in logged form for the reasons explained in section 3. \nSecond, we include civilization dyad-specific time trends to account for common trends and \ndynamics in all countries of a particular inter-civilizational combination. These extensions to \nequation (2) lead to: \n \n1 2 3\n2 , ,\nln( 1) ln( 1) ln( 1) ...\nt\nijt ik int njt c c t ijtkjm\nk i m t n i j n i j\ny w y y u u year Ty\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b5\n\u2260 = \u2212 \u2260 \u2260\n= + + + + + + + \u22c5 + + +\u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 (3) \n \nwhere \n,\nint\nn i j\ny\n\u2260\n\u2211  is the time-varying general terror propensity of (potential) terror country i, \n,\nnjt\nn i j\ny\n\u2260\n\u2211  is the time-varying general terror propensity of (potential) target country j, cu year\u22c5  \nrepresent civilization dyad-specific time trends, while tT  capture global year-specific time \nfixed effects. In sum, estimation equation (3) represents a conservative research design. If we \nfind evidence for spatial dependence in this design, we can be fairly certain that such evidence \nis not spurious. \n \n5. Results \nWe first present in table 2 estimation results, in which the spatial lag variables are only \nconditioned on the Cold War (1970 to 1989) and post-Cold War periods (1990 to 2005) and \n19 \nno distinction is made according to specific inter-civilizational combinations.5 A statistically \nsignificant coefficient of the spatial lag variable in the post-Cold War period would suggest \nspatial dependence during this period, while a statistically significant positive difference \nbetween the coefficients of the post-Cold War and Cold War spatial lag variables would \nsuggest a significant increase in spatial dependence after the end of the Cold War.6 Both \neffects would be consistent with Huntington\u2019s predictions. The first model in table 2 excludes \ncivilization dyad-specific dummy variables and time trends and therefore is likely to lead to \nan upward biased coefficient of the spatial lag variable. The second model includes \ncivilization dyad-specific dummy variables, while the third model additionally includes \ncivilization dyad-specific time trends. This last specification is the most stringent and \nconservative one. \n \n                                                 \n5\n  We let the post-Cold War period start in 1990, but our results are fully robust to a start up to two \nyears prior or after this date. Our sample starts in 1970 since with the inclusion of the spatial lag \nvariables we lose the first two years of the Iterate dataset. \n6\n  Testing for whether the difference between the two estimated coefficients is statistically \nsignificantly different from zero is similar to tests for a kind of structural break at the end of the \nCold War that others have done (Chiozza 2002; Bolks and Stoll 2003; Gartzke and Gleditsch \n2006). \n20 \nTable 2.

Year dummies always included. \n* p(z)<0.05 ** p(z)<0.01. \n \nBefore turning to the estimated coefficients of the spatial lag variables, which are our main \ninterest, we briefly discuss results on the control variables. As expected, both population sizes \nof the terrorists\u2019 home country and of the target country have a positive effect. In other words, \nmore populous countries generate more terrorism and suffer more from terrorism. As with \nmany other forms of violent conflict, distance matters: The number of terrorist incidents dec-\nlines as the geographical distance between the terrorists\u2019 home country and the target country \nincreases. Contiguous country dyads do not experience more international terrorism, however. \n21 \nWe find evidence that a higher per capita income in the terrorists\u2019 home country lowers \nterrorism (except in model 2), even though our results say of course nothing on the economic \nconditions faced by the individual terrorists themselves. As expected, targets from richer \ncountries are more attractive to international terrorists. The type of regime has no impact on \npatterns of international terrorism in either the terrorists\u2019 home country or the target country. \nConditional on the other explanatory variables and particularly controlling for per capita \nincome, which is highly correlated with democracy, as well as the general terror propensity of \nterrorists\u2019 home and target countries, democracies do not differ from autocracies. As \nexpected, a higher general propensity of nationals from the origin country to generate \nterrorism raises terrorism for country dyads formed by this country. Similarly, a higher \ngeneral propensity of nationals from the target country to suffer from terrorism raises \nterrorism for dyads in which this country is the target country of the directed country dyad. \nTurning now to the specific source contagion spatial lag variables, which capture \nHuntington\u2019s civilizational rallying hypothesis, we find that the coefficients for the spatial lag \nvariables are statistically significantly different from zero in the Cold War and the post-Cold \nWar period in all model specifications. While the coefficients become smaller the more \nstringent and conservative our estimation strategy, there is nevertheless evidence consistent \nwith Huntington\u2019s hypothesis of a rallying effect even in the model that includes both \ncivilization dyad dummies and trends. However, the difference in the estimated coefficients \nbetween the two time periods is only statistically significant even at the more generous 10 per \ncent level in models 1 and 2. Moreover, with more than half a million observations standard \nerrors tend to be low and coefficients are often statistically significant even if the substantive \nimportance of effects can be small. This is what we find for the spatial lag variables: in model \n3, a one standard deviation increase in the spatial lag variables during the Cold War and post-\nCold War period lead to an increase of only 4.4 and 5.2 per cent, respectively, in the expected \nrate of terror incidents (other variables at mean values). In comparison, a one standard \n22 \ndeviation increase in the population size and per capita income of the target country increases \nthe expected count of terror incidents by 125 and 104 per cent, respectively, while a one \nstandard deviation increase in the terror propensity of the terror country raises the expected \ncount by 128 per cent. Even a move from minimum to maximum in the post-Cold War spatial \nlag variable increases the expected count of terror incidents only by a relatively modest 89 per \ncent. \nNext, we focus on Huntington\u2019s argument that terrorism is more likely to be used in some \ninter-civilizational conflicts than in others and particularly in the clash between the Muslim \nworld and the West. Thus, in the models reported in table 3 we no longer simply look at \nglobal spatial dependence in international terrorism, but we model more carefully \nHuntington\u2019s proposition that terrorism is a weapon used more in some inter-civilizational \nconflicts than in others. In table 3, we take the spatial lag variable, which has already been \nconditioned on the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, and condition it further on specific \ninter-civilizational combinations. Table 3 exclusively reports coefficients of the specific \nsource contagion spatial lag variables since the coefficients of the control variables remain \nrobust and do not matter for testing Huntington\u2019s rallying prediction. To save space, we only \nshow two sets of estimations each, namely the one without civilization dyad-specific controls \nand the one with both civilization dyad-specific dummies and time trends included. \nStarting with the non-Western against Western combination (models 4 and 5), we find \nevidence for civilizational rallying effects in both model specifications for dyads falling into \nthe non-Western vs. Western civilizational combination for both the Cold War and the post-\nCold War period. The coefficients are slightly larger in the post-Cold War period, but not \nsignificantly so. As before, the substantive impact of the rallying effect remains small. A one \nstandard deviation increase in the post-Cold War spatial lag variable leads to a 18.9 (model 4) \nand 10.7 per cent (model 5) increase in the expected rate of terror incidents. \n23 \nModels 6 and 7 condition the spatial lag variables on the Islam versus non-Islamic \ncivilizational combinations, whereas models 8 and 9 do the same for the Islam versus West \ncombinations. For both combinations, there is evidence for civilizational rallying effects in \nthe post-Cold War period in both model specifications. Moreover, the coefficients of the \nspatial lag variable increase significantly from the Cold War to the post-Cold War period. In \nfact, the spatial lag coefficients are not even significantly different from zero in the Cold War \nperiod, suggesting that there was no rallying effect during this time period for dyads of the \nIslam versus non-Islam and Islam versus West combinations. For the other combinations, \nthere is some evidence for rallying effects in both periods, but the coefficient either decreases \nin the post-Cold War period or if it increases, the difference is far from statistically \nsignificant.  \nAs before, in substantive terms the rallying effect seems to be rather small though. A one \nstandard deviation increase in the respective spatial lag variables raises the expected count of \nterrorist incidents by between 17.8 and 9 per cent (Islam versus Rest) and by 29.9 and 15.5 \nper cent (Islam versus West) in the post-Cold War period, depending on whether civilization \ndyad dummies and time trends are included in the model specification or not (all other \nvariables at mean values). While certainly larger than the estimated substantive effects for all \ninter-civilizational combinations, these estimated effects are still relatively modest. \nAltogether, there is thus evidence for Huntington\u2019s rallying effect in all models, including the \nmost stringently and conservatively specified ones, but the rallying effect, whilst existent, \nseems to be relatively small in size. \n24 \nTable 4.

Conclusion \nIn this article, we have tested the hypothesis that international terrorism is spatially dependent along \ncivilizational lines in the post-Cold War period and particularly so for certain inter-civilizational \ncombinations. We found indeed evidence for this: even when we control for common trends and \nshocks and spatial clustering, the estimated coefficients of the spatial lag variable remain \nstatistically significantly different from zero in the post-Cold War period. While the post-Cold War \nperiod coefficients are not higher than the ones from the Cold War period in the general estimations \nof model 3 and for the non-Western versus Western combination in any of the model specifications, \nwe find a significant increase in the coefficient sizes of the spatial lag variables for the Islam versus \nRest and Islam versus West combinations between the two time periods, which is consistent with \nHuntington\u2019s predictions. With several hundred thousand observations, coefficients are easily \nstatistically significant. We have therefore also assessed the substantive importance of the estimated \neffects. Here, we found that any rallying effect is only rather modest in size. In sum, while we find \nevidence consistent with Huntington\u2019s predictions, in substantive terms rallying effects seem to be \nof relatively small importance. \nOne may also wonder whether there are other explanations for our findings. From a theoretical \nperspective one would expect the very same spatial pattern if, say, radical Islamic groups were not \nrallying in the spirit of a Clash of Civilizations, but competing with each other for scarce resources \nprovided by supporters with similar political goals. In other words, competition between terrorist \ngroups, which have similar ideologies, for scarce support in terms of finance, logistics and the \nrecruitment of terror agents, may force these groups to match successful inter-civilizational terrorist \nattacks of rivaling groups by strengthening their own activities.7 With the data currently available, \nwe cannot discriminate between these two explanations, which may of course be both valid at the \nsame time. Future research should try to tackle this question, but it is not entirely clear whether this \n                                                 \n7\n  The fact that empirical evidence is consistent with more than one theory is known as under-\ndetermination. \n26 \ncan be successfully done. Micro-level research on the strategic fundraising behavior of different \nterror groups might provide an answer. Needless to say, however, that such research is difficult to \nundertake and potentially dangerous to researchers as well. \nIf Huntington\u2019s hypothesis is correct and rallying effects exist particularly amongst Islamic \nterrorist groups, then this makes dealing with the threat they pose very difficult. From the \nperspective of counterterrorism, primarily focusing on a single radical group or a single country is \nnot a promising strategy due to the contagion effects. Rather, a broad strategy is needed which \nsimultaneously deals with the political and other root causes of radical Islamic terrorism and its \nvarious manifestations across the Islamic civilization. The traditional counterterrorism strategies \nwill be of limited effectiveness in the presence of decentralized groups whose terror spills over into \nterror from other groups with similar ideologies and strategies. \n27 \nReferences \nAbadie, Alberto. 2006. \u201cPoverty, Political Freedom, and the Roots of Terrorism.\u201d American \nEconomic Review 96 (2): 50-56. \nAchenbach, Joel. 2001.
