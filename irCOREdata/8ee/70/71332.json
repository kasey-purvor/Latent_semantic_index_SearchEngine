Introduction\nThe first result concerning ideals in the Banach algebra of continuous linear operators\non an infinite-dimensional Banach space is due to Calkin, who in [3] classified all the\nideals in B(\u00012). In particular he proved that the ideal of compact operators is the only\nnon-trivial, closed ideal in B(\u00012). For a non-separable Hilbert space H, Gramsch and\nLuft have independently described all the closed ideals in B(H) and shown that they\n523\n524 N. J. Laustsen\nare totally ordered by inclusion (see [13] and [22], respectively). Another extension of\nCalkin\u2019s result is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1 (Gohberg, Markus and Feldman [8]). For X = \u0001p, where 1 \u0001 p <\n\u221e, and X = c0, the ideal of compact operators is the unique non-trivial, closed ideal in\nB(X).\nWe are not aware of any other infinite-dimensional Banach spaces X for which the\nlattice of closed ideals in B(X) is completely understood.\nThe aim of this paper is to study the maximal ideals in B(X) for various Banach spaces\nX and in this way gain insight into the closed ideal structure of B(X). In \u00a7 2 we set up\nour basic notation and conventions, and in \u00a7 3 we outline the material from the theory of\noperator ideals that we require. The main result of \u00a7 4 is that the ideal of weakly compact\noperators is the unique maximal ideal in B(Jp), where 1 < p < \u221e and Jp is the pth James\nspace. The proof of this theorem also provides new information about the lattice of closed\nideals in B(Jp); it relies on generalizations of results known for James\u2019s original space J2.\nAs a consequence of the uniqueness of the maximal ideal in B(Jp), we derive in \u00a7 5 that\nthe Brown\u2013McCoy radical of B(X), which by definition is the intersection of all maximal\nideals in B(X), cannot be turned into an operator ideal. This implies that the Brown\u2013\nMcCoy radical cannot be used to obtain an analogue of Pietsch\u2019s construction of the\noperator ideal of inessential operators from the Jacobson radical of B(X)\/A(X). In \u00a7 6\nwe study the lattice of closed ideals in B(X) for the Banach space\nX := J\u2295\u03bd1p1 \u2295 J\u2295\u03bd2p2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 J\u2295\u03bdnpn \u2295 \u0001pn+1 \u2295 \u0001pn+2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 \u0001pn+m ,\nwhere n,m, \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdn are natural numbers and p1, . . . , pn+m are distinct real numbers\nwith p1, . . . , pn \u2208 ]1,\u221e[ and pn+1, . . . , pn+m \u2208 [1,\u221e[. We show that the closed ideals in\nB(X) containing the ideal of inessential operators are classified by the non-zero, closed\nideals in B(J\u2295\u03bd1p1 ), . . . ,B(J\u2295\u03bdnpn ), B(\u0001pn+1), . . . ,B(\u0001pn+m). In particular B(X) has exactly\nn + m maximal ideals; n of these maximal ideals have finite codimensions \u03bd21 , . . . , \u03bd\n2\nn in\nB(X), respectively, and m have infinite codimension in B(X). In \u00a7 7 we prove that the ideal\nof strictly singular operators is the unique maximal ideal in B(X) for each hereditarily\nindecomposable Banach space X. Finally, in \u00a7 8 we provide an example of a Banach\nspace G such that there are infinitely many (22\n\u21350 , to be precise) distinct maximal ideals\nin B(G), and we classify these maximal ideals.\n2. Notation\nThroughout this paper all vector spaces and algebras are assumed to be over the field C\nof complex numbers.\nFor vector spaces X and Y, the collection of all linear maps from X to Y is denoted\nby L(X,Y) (or L(X) in the case where X = Y). We write IX for the identity map on\nX. Let T : X \u2192 Y be a linear map. We denote by imT the image of T and by kerT\nthe kernel of T . Suppose that X0 and Y0 are linear subspaces of X and Y, respectively,\nsatisfying T (X0) \u2286 Y0. Then we define T |Y0X0 : x \u0006\u2192 Tx, X0 \u2192 Y0. If X0 = X, then we\nomit the subscript X0, and if Y0 = Y, then we omit the superscript Y0.\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 525\nLet X and Y be Banach spaces. A continuous linear map from X to Y is termed an\noperator. The collection of all operators from X to Y is denoted by B(X,Y) (or B(X)\nin the case where X = Y). We write spanX0 for the linear span of a subset X0 of X;\nspanX0 denotes its norm closure. We write X\u2217 for the dual space of X, and we denote\nby \u03baX : X \u2192 X\u2217\u2217 the canonical embedding of X into its bidual space X\u2217\u2217.\nLet n be a natural number. The direct sum of the vector spaces X1, . . . ,Xn is denoted\nby X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn (or X\u2295n in the case where X1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Xn = X). For each k \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\nwe write Jk : Xk \u2192 X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn for the canonical kth coordinate embedding, and we\nwrite Qk : X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn \u2192 Xk for the canonical kth coordinate projection. In the case\nwhere X1, . . . ,Xn are Banach spaces, their direct sum is a Banach space for the norm\n\u2016(x1, . . . , xn)\u2016 := max{\u2016x1\u2016, . . . , \u2016xn\u2016}, where (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208 X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn.\nLet m and n be natural numbers, and let X1, . . . ,Xn and Y1, . . . ,Ym be vector spaces.\nWith a linear map T : X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn \u2192 Y1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym, we associate the (m \u00d7 n)-matrix\n(Tj,k)\nm,n\nj,k=1, where Tj,k is the linear map given by the commutative diagram\nXk\nTj,k \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nJk\n\u0002\u0002\nYj\nX1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn T \u0001\u0001 Y1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym.\nQj\n\u0003\u0003\nIn this way we obtain a bijective correspondence between L(X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn,Y1 \u2295\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym) and the set of (m \u00d7 n)-matrices with their (j, k)th entry belonging to\nL(Xk,Yj) for each pair (j, k) \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} \u00d7 {1, . . . , n}. This correspondence is linear,\nand, when defined, the composition of linear maps corresponds to the multiplication\nof matrices. In the case where X1, . . . ,Xn and Y1, . . . ,Ym are Banach spaces, the sub-\nspace B(X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn,Y1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym) of L(X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn,Y1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym) is mapped\nonto the set of (m \u00d7 n)-matrices with their (j, k)th entry in B(Xk,Yj) for each pair\n(j, k) \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} \u00d7 {1, . . . , n}.\nFor an algebra A and a natural number n, we denote by Mn(A) the algebra of (n \u00d7 n)-\nmatrices over A. The above results show that we may identify L(X\u2295n) with Mn(L(X))\nfor each vector space X. In the case where X is a Banach space, this implies identifying\nB(X\u2295n) with Mn(B(X)).\n3. Preliminaries on operator ideals\nThis section summarizes the parts of the vast theory of operator ideals that we require.\nWe begin with the fundamental definition which is due to Pietsch.\nDefinition 3.1. An operator ideal is an assignment I which associates with each pair\n(X,Y) of Banach spaces a linear subspace I(X,Y) of B(X,Y) satisfying\n(i) I(X,Y) is non-zero for some Banach spaces X and Y;\n526 N. J. Laustsen\n(ii) for any Banach spaces W, X, Y and Z, the composite operator TSR belongs to\nI(W,Z) whenever R belongs to B(W,X), S to I(X,Y) and T to B(Y,Z).\nWe usually write I(X) instead of I(X,X).\nAn operator ideal I is closed if the subspace I(X,Y) is closed in the operator norm of\nB(X,Y) for each pair (X,Y) of Banach spaces.\nRemark 3.2. Operator ideals fit nicely into the matrix representation of operators\nbetween direct sums of Banach spaces described in \u00a7 2. Indeed, for an operator ideal I,\nBanach spaces X1, . . . ,Xn,Y1, . . . ,Ym, and an operator T : X1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Xn \u2192 Y1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Ym\nwith associated matrix (Tj,k)\nm,n\nj,k=1, we have: T belongs to I(X1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Xn,Y1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Ym)\nif and only if Tj,k belongs to I(Xk,Yj) for each pair (j, k) \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} \u00d7 {1, . . . , n}.\nIn this paper, we shall consider the following standard closed operator ideals:\nA the approximable operators;\nK the compact operators;\nS the strictly singular operators;\nE the inessential operators (an operator T : X \u2192 Y is termed inessential\nif IX \u2212 ST is a Fredholm operator for each operator S : Y \u2192 X);\nV the completely continuous operators;\nW the weakly compact operators.\nFor each pair (X,Y) of Banach spaces, the hierarchy among these operator ideals is as\nfollows (see [23, p. 93] and [24, \u00a7\u00a7 1.11 and 26.7]):\nB(X,Y)\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\nE(X,Y)\nV(X,Y)\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0004\u0004\nW(X,Y)\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\nS(X,Y)\nV(X,Y) \u2229 W(X,Y)\nK(X,Y)\nA(X,Y)\n{0}.\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 527\nIn this diagram, a line denotes set-theoretic inclusion with the larger set at the top of\nthe line. All the indicated inclusions may be proper.\nWe shall also consider operator ideals consisting of the operators that factor through a\ngiven operator. Indeed, let E, F, X and Y be Banach spaces, let \u0393 : E \u2192 F be an operator,\nand set\nP\u0393 (X,Y) := span{T\u0393S | S \u2208 B(X,E), T \u2208 B(F,Y)} and Q\u0393 (X,Y) := P\u0393 (X,Y).\nProposition 3.3. Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let \u0393 : E \u2192 F be a non-zero\noperator. Then P\u0393 is an operator ideal, and Q\u0393 is a closed operator ideal.\nWe call P\u0393 the algebraic operator ideal generated by \u0393 and Q\u0393 the closed operator ideal\ngenerated by \u0393 . These operator ideals generalize a construction due to Porta (see [25]\nand [2]). In our application we shall require the following technical fact.\nProposition 3.4. Let E, F and X be Banach spaces, and let \u0393 : E \u2192 F be an operator.\nAn idempotent operator belongs to P\u0393 (X) if and only if it belongs to Q\u0393 (X).\nProof. Suppose that P \u2208 Q\u0393 (X) is idempotent. If P = 0, then the result is obvious.\nOtherwise we can take an operator S \u2208 P\u0393 (X) such that \u2016P\u2212S\u2016 < \u2016P\u2016\u22122. It follows that\n\u2016P \u2212 PSP\u2016 < 1. Since PB(X)P is a Banach algebra with identity P , this implies that\nPSP is invertible in PB(X)P by [4, Proposition 2.1.1], and so we can take T \u2208 PB(X)P\nsuch that (PSP )T = P . This shows that P belongs to P\u0393 (X). \u0002\nFor an operator \u0393 : E \u2192 F, denote by \u0393 \u2295 \u0393 : E \u2295 E \u2192 F \u2295 F the diagonal operator\ninduced by \u0393 , that is, (\u0393 \u2295 \u0393 )(x, y) = (\u0393x, \u0393y) for (x, y) \u2208 E \u2295 E. An immediate\ngeneralization of the proof of [2, Theorem 5.13] yields the following proposition.\nProposition 3.5. Let E and F be Banach spaces. For each operator \u0393 : E \u2192 F, the\nfollowing assertions are equivalent:\n(a) there are operators U : E\u2295E \u2192 E and V : F \u2192 F\u2295F such that \u0393 \u2295\u0393 = V \u0393U ; and\n(b) P\u0393 (X,Y) = {T\u0393S | S \u2208 B(X,E), T \u2208 B(F,Y)} for each pair (X,Y) of Banach\nspaces.\nLemma 3.6. Let X and Y be Banach spaces.\n(i) Let P : X \u2192 X and Q : Y \u2192 Y be idempotent operators. There are operators\nS : X \u2192 Y and T : Y \u2192 X such that P = TS and Q = ST if and only if the images\nof P and Q are isomorphic.\n(ii) Suppose that S : X \u2192 Y and T : Y \u2192 X are operators such that TS is idempotent.\nThen STST is idempotent, and the images of TS and STST are isomorphic.\nProof. (i) If S : X \u2192 Y and T : Y \u2192 X are operators with P = TS and Q = ST , then\nS(imP ) \u2286 imQ, T (imQ) \u2286 imP , and S|imQimP is an isomorphism with inverse T |imPimQ.\nConversely, if U : imP \u2192 imQ is an isomorphism, then the operators S := U |YP |imP\nand T := (U\u22121)|XQ|imQ satisfy TS = P and ST = Q.\n(ii) This is immediate from (i). \u0002\n528 N. J. Laustsen\nIn the case where the generating operator \u0393 is idempotent, we can now reformulate\nProposition 3.5 as follows.\nCorollary 3.7. For an idempotent operator \u0393 on a Banach space E, the following\nassertions are equivalent:\n(a) im\u0393 contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to im\u0393 \u2295 im\u0393 ; and\n(b) P\u0393 (X,Y) = {TS | S \u2208 B(X, im\u0393 ), T \u2208 B(im\u0393,Y)} for each pair (X,Y) of Banach\nspaces.\n4. The lattice of closed ideals in B(Jp) for 1 < p < \u221e\nThroughout this section, we fix a real number p in the open interval ]1,\u221e[. Our aim\nis to understand the lattice of closed ideals in B(Jp), where Jp is the pth James space\n(to be defined below). Our main result is that W(Jp) is the unique maximal ideal in\nB(Jp).\nFor p = 2, Loy and Willis have shown that K(J2) \u0001 QI\u00012 (J2) \u0001 W(J2) and thatQI\u00012 (J2) \t\u2286 S(J2) = E(J2) (see [21, Theorem 2.7]). Saksman and Tylli have improved\nthis by observing that K(J2) = S(J2) (see [26, Remark 3.9]). We generalize these results\nto arbitrary p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[, and we complement them, showing that the lattice of closed ideals\nin B(Jp) has the following structure:\nB(Jp)\nW(Jp)\nQI\u0001p (Jp)\nA(Jp) = K(Jp) = S(Jp) = E(Jp) = V(Jp)\n{0},\nwhere all the indicated inclusions are proper, and only at the dotted line may there be\nfurther closed ideals.\nDefinition 4.1. For each sequence x = (\u03b1k)k\u2208N of complex numbers, set\n\u2016x\u2016Jp := sup\n{(n\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n|\u03b1km \u2212 \u03b1km+1 |p\n)1\/p \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223n, k1, . . . , kn \u2208 N, n \u0003 2, k1 < k2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < kn}.\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 529\nThe pth James space is\nJp := {(\u03b1k)k\u2208N | \u03b1k \u2208 C (k \u2208 N), \u2016(\u03b1k)k\u2208N\u2016Jp < \u221e and \u03b1k \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e}.\nThen (Jp, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Jp) is a Banach space with a monotone basis (ek)k\u2208N given by ek =\n(\u03b4k,m)m\u2208N for each k \u2208 N, where \u03b4k,m is Kronecker\u2019s delta symbol. This basis is shrinking,\nso that the biorthogonal functionals (fk)k\u2208N associated with (ek)k\u2208N form a basis for J\u2217p.\nA fundamental property of Jp is that it is quasireflexive, that is, its canonical image\n\u03baJp(Jp) in its bidual space J\n\u2217\u2217\np has codimension one; for p = 2, this is due to James\n(see [16]). An immediate consequence of the quasireflexivity of Jp is that the ideal W(Jp)\nof weakly compact operators has codimension one in B(Jp) and hence is a maximal\nideal.\nWe shall now introduce a class of operators on Jp which will play an important role in\nour analysis of the closed ideal structure of B(Jp). Set\nJ := {(jk)k\u2208N0 | j0 = 0, jk \u2208 N and jk\u22121 < jk (k \u2208 N)},\nand, for each j = (jk)k\u2208N0 \u2208 J, define\nHjek :=\njk\u2211\nm=jk\u22121+1\nem and Gjek :=\n{\nem if k = jm for some m \u2208 N,\n0 otherwise,\n(k \u2208 N).\n(4.1)\nBy linearity and continuity, Hj and Gj extend to operators (also denoted by Hj and Gj)\nof norm one on Jp satisfying\nGjHj = IJp . (4.2)\nIt follows that HjGj and hence Pj := IJp \u2212 HjGj are idempotent operators.\nLemma 4.2. Let j \u2208 J. The kernel of Pj is given by\nkerPj = imHj =\n{ \u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1k\n( jk\u2211\nm=jk\u22121+1\nem\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u03b1k)k\u2208N \u2208 Jp}, (4.3)\nand it is isomorphic to Jp. The image of Pj is given by\nimPj = kerGj = span {ek | k \u2208 N \\ {jm | m \u2208 N}}, (4.4)\nand it is reflexive.\nProof. The identities (4.3) and (4.4) are easily verified using (4.2). Lemma 3.6 (i)\nimplies that kerPj = imHjGj \u223c= imGjHj = Jp. Since kerPj \u2295 imPj \u223c= Jp, we conclude\nthat imPj is reflexive. \u0002\nNote that Lemma 4.2 has [5, Corollary 3 and Theorem 5 (including Remark (ii))] as\nimmediate consequences.\n530 N. J. Laustsen\nTo determine the isomorphism type of the complemented subspace imPj of Jp for each\nj \u2208 J, we consider, for each n \u2208 N, the n-dimensional Banach space\nJ(n)p := span{e1, . . . , en}\nequipped with the norm it inherits as a subspace of Jp. Let (nk)k\u2208N be a sequence of\nnatural numbers, and let (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p denote the direct sum of J\n(n1)\np , J\n(n2)\np , . . . in the\nsense of \u0001p. As for finite direct sums, we write\nJk : J(nk)p \u2192\n( \u221e\u2295\nm=1\nJ(nm)p\n)\n\u0003p\nfor the canonical kth coordinate embedding. The canonical basis\n(J1(e1), J1(e2), . . . , J1(en1), J2(e1), J2(e2), . . . ,\nJ2(en2), . . . , Jk(e1), Jk(e2), . . . , Jk(enk), . . . )\nof (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p satisfies\n\u2016Jk(e1) + Jk(e2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Jk(enk)\u2016 = \u2016e1 + e2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + enk\u2016Jp = 1 (k \u2208 N).\nIf the sequence (nk)k\u2208N is unbounded, then this implies that (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p is not uni-\nformly convexifiable by Gurari\u02d8\u0131\u2013Gurari\u02d8\u0131\u2019s Theorem (see [14, Theorems 345 and 352]); for\np = 2, this is observed in [5, p. 267]. On the other hand, Clarkson\u2019s theorem states that\n\u0001p is uniformly convex (see [14, Theorem 333]), and so we reach the following conclusion.\nLemma 4.3. Let (nk)k\u2208N be an unbounded sequence of natural numbers. Then \u0001p is\nnot isomorphic to (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p .\nProposition 4.4. For each j = (jk)k\u2208N0 \u2208 J, set gap(j) := {k \u2208 N | jk > jk\u22121 + 1}.\n(i) If gap(j) is the empty set, then Pj = 0 and QPj (Jp) = {0}.\n(ii) If gap(j) is a finite, non-empty set, then Pj has finite rank and QPj (Jp) = A(Jp).\n(iii) If gap(j) is an infinite set and the sequence (jk \u2212 jk\u22121)k\u2208N is bounded, then the\nimage of Pj is isomorphic to \u0001p and QPj (Jp) = QI\u0001p (Jp).\n(iv) If the sequence (jk \u2212 jk\u22121)k\u2208N is unbounded, then the image of Pj is isomorphic to\n(\n\u2295\u221e\nn=1 J\n(n)\np )\u0003p and QI\u0001p (Jp) \u0001 QPj (Jp) \u2286 W(Jp).\nThis characterization will be completed in Proposition 4.18, below, where we show\nthat if the sequence (jk \u2212 jk\u22121)k\u2208N is unbounded, then QPj (Jp) = W(Jp).\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 531\nProof. Clauses (i) and (ii) are obvious, so we may assume that gap(j) is an infinite\nset, say gap(j) = {\u03bd1, \u03bd2, . . . }, where \u03bd1 < \u03bd2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . For each k \u2208 N, set \u00b5k := j\u03bdk\u22121 \u2208 N0\nand nk := j\u03bdk \u2212 j\u03bdk\u22121 \u2212 1 \u2208 N. Using (4.4), it is straightforward to verify that\nimPj = span {e\u00b5k+m | k \u2208 N, m \u2208 {1, . . . , nk}}.\nObserve that \u00b5k + nk < \u00b5k+1 for each k \u2208 N, so that we can define a linear map\nV : span{e\u00b5k+m | k \u2208 N, m \u2208 {1, . . . , nk}} \u2192\n( \u221e\u2295\nk=1\nJ(nk)p\n)\n\u0003p\nby V e\u00b5k+m := Jk(em) for k \u2208 N and m \u2208 {1, . . . , nk}. As in the proof of [5, Lemma 2], we\ncan show that V is continuous and bounded below. Since V has dense image, it extends\nto an isomorphism from imPj onto (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p .\nIn the case where the sequence (jk\u2212jk\u22121)k\u2208N is bounded, it is clear that (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p\nis isomorphic to \u0001p, and (iii) follows.\nFor (jk \u2212 jk\u22121)k\u2208N unbounded, (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p is isomorphic to (\n\u2295\u221e\nn=1 J\n(n)\np )\u0003p by [6,\nLemma 5] because the Banach\u2013Mazur distance between the (m+n)-dimensional Banach\nspaces J(m+n)p and J\n(m)\np \u2295 J(n)p is uniformly bounded in (m,n) \u2208 N2. The inclusions\nQI\u0001p (Jp) \u2286 QPj (Jp) \u2286 W(Jp) hold because imPj is reflexive and contains a comple-\nmented subspace isomorphic to \u0001p. Assume towards a contradiction that Pj belongs\nto QI\u0001p (Jp). Then Proposition 3.4 shows that Pj actually belongs to PI\u0001p (Jp). By Corol-\nlary 3.7, there are operators S : Jp \u2192 \u0001p and T : \u0001p \u2192 Jp such that Pj = TS. It follows\nfrom Lemma 3.6 (ii) that Q := STST \u2208 B(\u0001p) is idempotent and imQ is isomorphic\nto imPj . In particular, imQ is infinite dimensional, so [20, Theorem 2.a.3] implies that\nimQ is isomorphic to \u0001p, contradicting Lemma 4.3. \u0002\nWe note in particular that Proposition 4.4 (iv) generalizes Loy and Willis\u2019s observation\nthat QI\u00012 (J2) \u0001 W(J2).\nCorollary 4.5. The closed ideal QI\u0001p (Jp) is properly contained in W(Jp).\nFor p = 2, our next proposition is a combination of results due to Herman and Whitley\n(see the proof of Lemma 1 in [15]) and Casazza, Bor-Luh Lin and Lohman (see [5, The-\norem 10]). The original proofs can be generalized directly; our approach using Proposi-\ntion 4.4 gives a quick unified proof.\nLemma 4.6. Let (xk)k\u2208N be a normalized block basic sequence of the basis (ek)k\u2208N\nof Jp with a \u2018gap\u2019 between any two consecutive blocks, that is, each basis vector has the\nform\nxk =\njk\u22121\u2211\nm=jk\u22121+1\n\u03b1mem (k \u2208 N),\nwhere \u03b11, \u03b12, . . . are complex numbers, j0 = 0, and j1, j2, . . . are integers satisfying\njk > jk\u22121 + 1 (k \u2208 N).\n532 N. J. Laustsen\nThen (xk)k\u2208N is equivalent to the standard basis of \u0001p, and span {xk | k \u2208 N} is comple-\nmented in Jp.\nProof. By assumption, j := (jk)k\u2208N0 belongs to J with gap(j) = N. As in the proof\nof Proposition 4.4, we can construct an isomorphism V : imPj \u2192 (\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p , where\nnk = jk \u2212 jk\u22121 \u2212 1 for each k \u2208 N. Since span {xk | k \u2208 N} is contained in imPj by (4.4)\nand imPj is complemented in Jp, it suffices to show that the basic sequence (V xk)k\u2208N is\nequivalent to the standard basis of \u0001p and that span {V xk | k \u2208 N} is complemented in\n(\n\u2295\u221e\nk=1 J\n(nk)\np )\u0003p . However, this follows immediately from the facts that V xk \u2208 im Jk for\neach k \u2208 N, inf{\u2016V xk\u2016 | k \u2208 N} > 0, and sup{\u2016V xk\u2016 | k \u2208 N} < \u221e. \u0002\nWe can now generalize the proof of [5, Corollary 11] to obtain the following important\nresult.\nCorollary 4.7. Each closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of Jp contains a subspace\nwhich is isomorphic to \u0001p and complemented in Jp.\nLemma 4.8. Suppose that (xk)k\u2208N is a sequence in Jp satisfying the following:\n(i) (xk)k\u2208N converges weakly to zero; and\n(ii) inf{\u2016xk\u2016Jp | k \u2208 N} > 0.\nThen a subsequence of (xk)k\u2208N is a basic sequence equivalent to the standard basis of \u0001p.\nProof. By [20, Proposition 1.a.12], a subsequence (x\u2032k)k\u2208N of (xk)k\u2208N is equivalent to\na block basic sequence (wk)k\u2208N of (ek)k\u2208N. Lemma 4.6 implies that (w2k\/\u2016w2k\u2016Jp)k\u2208N\nis equivalent to the standard basis (dk)k\u2208N of \u0001p. By the uniform boundedness principle,\n(xk)k\u2208N is norm-bounded, and therefore (wk)k\u2208N is norm-bounded. Condition (ii) implies\nthat inf{\u2016wk\u2016Jp | k \u2208 N} > 0. It follows that (w2k)k\u2208N is equivalent to (dk)k\u2208N because\n(dk)k\u2208N is an unconditional basis. Hence the subsequence (x\u20322k)k\u2208N of (xk)k\u2208N has the\ndesired properties. \u0002\nWe can now generalize Loy\u2013Willis\u2019s and Saksman\u2013Tylli\u2019s result that K(J2) = E(J2).\nProposition 4.9. The ideals of approximable, compact, strictly singular, inessential\nand completely continuous operators coincide in B(Jp):\nA(Jp) = K(Jp) = S(Jp) = E(Jp) = V(Jp).\nProof. The fact that Jp has a basis implies that A(Jp) = K(Jp). Since J\u2217p has a basis, it\nis separable, and so K(Jp) = V(Jp) by [18, Theorems 3 and 5]. As observed in [21, p. 334]\nin the case p = 2, Corollary 4.7 implies that S(Jp) = E(Jp) by [4, Theorem 5.6.5].\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 533\nSuppose that the operator T on Jp is not completely continuous. Then there is a\nsequence (xk)k\u2208N in Jp satisfying\n(i) (xk)k\u2208N converges weakly to zero; and\n(ii) inf{\u2016Txk\u2016Jp | k \u2208 N} > 0.\nCondition (ii) implies that inf{\u2016xk\u2016Jp | k \u2208 N} > 0, and so, by Lemma 4.8, we can take\na subsequence (x\u2032k)k\u2208N of (xk)k\u2208N and an operator U : \u0001p \u2192 Jp which is bounded below\nand satisfies Udk = x\u2032k for each k \u2208 N, where (dk)k\u2208N is the standard basis of \u0001p.\nThe sequence (Tx\u2032k)k\u2208N converges weakly to zero by (i), and inf{\u2016Tx\u2032k\u2016Jp | k \u2208 N} > 0\nby (ii). Hence, another application of Lemma 4.8 yields a subsequence (x\u2032km)m\u2208N of\n(x\u2032k)k\u2208N and an operator V : \u0001p \u2192 Jp which is bounded below and satisfies V dm = Tx\u2032km\nfor each m \u2208 N. The fact that (dk)k\u2208N is a (sub)symmetric basis implies that there is\nan operator W : \u0001p \u2192 \u0001p which is bounded below and satisfies Wdm = dkm for each\nm \u2208 N by [20, \u00a7 3.a]. Since TUWdm = V dm for each m \u2208 N, we have TUW = V , and\nso T is not strictly singular because V is not strictly singular. We have thus shown that\nS(Jp) \u2286 V(Jp) = K(Jp), and the proof is complete. \u0002\nLemma 4.10. For each non-compact operator T on Jp, there is a closed subspace W\nof Jp satisfying\n(i) W is isomorphic to \u0001p;\n(ii) the restriction of T to W is bounded below; and\n(iii) T (W) is complemented in Jp.\nProof. By Proposition 4.9, T is not strictly singular. Take a closed, infinite-dimen-\nsional subspace X of Jp such that T |X is bounded below. Then T (X) is a closed, infinite-\ndimensional subspace of Jp, so that Corollary 4.7 implies that T (X) contains a subspace\nY which is isomorphic to \u0001p and complemented in Jp. Set W := X \u2229 T\u22121(Y). It follows\nthat T |YW : W \u2192 Y is an isomorphism, and hence (i)\u2013(iii) hold. \u0002\nRemark 4.11. Conditions (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 4.10 imply that the subspace W is\ncomplemented in Jp by [28, Lemma 1.1].\nCorollary 4.12. Each ideal in B(Jp) strictly larger than K(Jp) contains PI\u0001p (Jp).\nProof. Suppose that I is an ideal in B(Jp) containing a non-compact operator T . Then\nthere is a closed subspace W of Jp satisfying conditions (i)\u2013(iii) of Lemma 4.10. Take an\nisomorphism U : \u0001p \u2192 W and an idempotent operator P on Jp with imP = T (W). Set\nV := (T |T (W)W U)\u22121 \u2208 B(T (W), \u0001p). For each operator S in PI\u0001p (Jp), there are operators\nA : Jp \u2192 \u0001p and B : \u0001p \u2192 Jp with S = BA by Corollary 3.7.

It follows that S factors through T , and hence S belongs to I. \u0002\nWith each operator T on Jp, we associate the (infinite) matrix (Tk,m)\u221ek,m=1, where\nTk,m := fk(Tem) \u2208 C (k,m \u2208 N).\nThe facts that (fk)k\u2208N is a basis of J\u2217p and that\n\u2211n\nm=1 em is a unit vector in Jp for each\nn \u2208 N imply that the series \u2211\u221em=1 Tk,m converges for each k \u2208 N. In other words, the\nrows of the matrix of T are summable. Set\nD(Jp) :=\n{\nT \u2208 B(Jp)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u221e\u2211\nm=1\nTk,m = 0 for each k \u2208 N and (Tk,m)\u221ek,m=1 has only\nfinitely many non-zero entries in each row and column\n}\n.\nLoy and Willis note that an operator T on J2 is weakly compact if and only if the\nsequence (\n\u2211\u221e\nm=1 Tk,m)k\u2208N converges to zero (see [21, p. 328]). This observation is also\ntrue for operators on Jp for any p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[. It follows that D(Jp) is contained in W(Jp).\nConversely, each weakly compact operator on Jp is the sum of a compact operator and an\noperator belonging to D(Jp). This result is proved by Loy and Willis for p = 2 (see [21,\nLemma 2.1]). Their proof carries over to the general case provided that the reference\nto [1, 3.2] is replaced with the elementary observation that, for each (\u03b1k)k\u2208N \u2208 Jp, the\ncoordinatewise multiplication map (\u03b2k)k\u2208N \u0006\u2192 (\u03b1k\u03b2k)k\u2208N defines a compact operator on\nJp of norm at most 2\u2016(\u03b1k)k\u2208N\u2016Jp . In conclusion, we have\nW(Jp) = D(Jp) + K(Jp).

The operators An,j are at the heart of Loy\nand Willis\u2019s construction of a bounded right approximate identity in W(J2) (see [21,\nTheorem 2.3]; note that An,j is denoted by A(n, j) in [21]). Loy and Willis\u2019s proof can\nbe adapted to work for any p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[, yielding the following key result.\nLemma 4.13. For each operator T belonging to D(Jp), there is an element j \u2208 J such\nthat\n\u2016TAn,j\u2016 \u0001 p\n\u2217\n\u221a\n2\nn\n\u2016T\u2016 (n \u2208 N),\nwhere p\u2217 = p\/(p \u2212 1) is the conjugate exponent of p.\nLemma 4.14. The operator IJp \u2212 \u039b belongs to the ideal PI\u0001p (Jp).\nProof. This is immediate from the fact that IJp \u2212 \u039b = \u0398\u2206, where\n\u2206: (\u03b1k)k\u2208N \u0006\u2192 (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b1k+1)k\u2208N, Jp \u2192 \u0001p,\nis the coordinatewise difference operator, and\n\u0398 : (\u03b1k)k\u2208N \u0006\u2192 (\u03b1k)k\u2208N, \u0001p \u2192 Jp,\nis the formal inclusion operator. \u0002\nCorollary 4.15. For each operator T belonging to D(Jp), there is an element j \u2208 J\nsuch that THj belongs to QI\u0001p (Jp).\nProof. Let \u03c0 : B(Jp) \u2192 B(Jp)\/QI\u0001p (Jp) be the quotient homomorphism, and take j \u2208\nJ as in Lemma 4.13. Then, for each n \u2208 N, we have\np\u2217\n\u221a\n2\nn\n\u2016T\u2016 \u0003 \u2016TAn,j\u2016 \u0003 \u2016\u03c0(TAn,j)\u2016 =\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03c0(T ) 1n\u03c0(Hj)\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c0(\u039b)k\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 = \u2016\u03c0(THj)\u2016\nbecause \u03c0(\u039b) = \u03c0(IJp) by Lemma 4.14. Since\np\u2217\n\u221a\n2\/n\u2016T\u2016 \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e and \u2016\u03c0(THj)\u2016\nis independent of n, we conclude that \u03c0(THj) = 0, and the result follows. \u0002\nTheorem 4.16. The ideal W(Jp) of weakly compact operators is the unique maximal\nideal in B(Jp).\nProof. The fact that the ideal W(Jp) has codimension one in B(Jp) implies that it is\nmaximal.\nTo see that it is unique, we show that each proper, closed ideal I in B(Jp) is con-\ntained in W(Jp). If I = {0} or I = K(Jp), then this is certainly true. Otherwise Corol-\nlary 4.12 implies that QI\u0001p (Jp) is contained in I. Each operator R on Jp can be written\n536 N. J. Laustsen\nR = \u03b6IJp + S, where \u03b6 belongs to C and S belongs to W(Jp). By (4.5), we can take T\nin D(Jp) and K in K(Jp) such that S = T + K. Corollary 4.15 implies that THj belongs\nto QI\u0001p (Jp) (and hence to I) for some j \u2208 J. Suppose that R belongs to I. Then, by (4.2),\nwe obtain\n\u03b6IJp = Gj(R \u2212 S)Hj = Gj(RHj \u2212 THj \u2212 KHj) \u2208 I.\nIt follows that \u03b6 = 0, and consequently R belongs to W(Jp). \u0002\nA similar result holds for the algebra B(J\u2295np ) of operators on the direct sum of n copies\nof Jp, where n is any natural number. This is an immediate consequence of the above\ntheorem, the identifications of B(J\u2295np ) and W(J\u2295np ) with Mn(B(Jp)) and Mn(W(Jp)),\nrespectively, and the standard algebraic fact [23, Proposition 1.6.10].\nCorollary 4.17. For each natural number n, the ideal W(J\u2295np ) of weakly compact\noperators is the unique maximal ideal in B(J\u2295np ).\nFinally, Corollary 4.15 enables us to complete the characterization of the ideals QPj (Jp)\nfor j \u2208 J begun in Proposition 4.4. Our result shows in particular that W(Jp) is the closed\nideal generated by a single idempotent operator.\nProposition 4.18. Let j = (jk)k\u2208N0 \u2208 J. If the sequence (jk\u2212jk\u22121)k\u2208N is unbounded,\nthen\nQPj (Jp) = W(Jp).\nProof. We already know that K(Jp) \u2286 QI\u0001p (Jp) \u2286 QPj (Jp) \u2286 W(Jp), so by (4.5) it\nsuffices to show that D(Jp) is contained in QPj (Jp). For each T in D(Jp), Corollary 4.15\nimplies that THi belongs to QI\u0001p (Jp) for some i \u2208 J. It follows from Proposition 4.4 that\nimPi is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of imPj . Hence Pi belongs to QPj (Jp),\nand so\nT = TPi + THiGi \u2208 QPj (Jp),\nas required. \u0002\nQuestion 4.19. Are there any closed ideals in B(Jp) between QI\u0001p (Jp) and W(Jp)?\n5. The Brown\u2013McCoy radical of B(X)\nIn this section we calculate the Brown\u2013McCoy radical of the algebra B(X) for various\nBanach spaces X, and we show that it cannot be turned into an operator ideal.\nDefinition 5.1. Let B be a unital algebra. The Brown\u2013McCoy radical (also known\nas the strong radical) of B is the intersection of all maximal ideals in B. The Jacobson\nradical of B is the intersection of all maximal left ideals in B. We denote these radicals\nby radBM B and radJ B, respectively.\nThe Brown\u2013McCoy and Jacobson radicals are proper ideals in B. The Brown\u2013McCoy\nradical always contains the Jacobson radical by [23, Theorem 4.5.9]. In the case where\nB is a unital Banach algebra, maximal (left) ideals are automatically closed, so that\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 537\nthe Brown\u2013McCoy and Jacobson radicals are closed ideals in B. We refer to [23, \u00a7\u00a7 4.3\nand 4.5] for further results on these radicals as well as their definitions in the non-unital\ncase.\nIt is well known that radJ B(X) = {0} for each Banach space X. In contrast to this, we\nnote that\nA(X) \u2286 radBM B(X) (5.1)\nwhenever the Banach space X is infinite dimensional. It follows from Theorem 1.1 that\nradBM B(c0) = K(c0) = A(c0) and radBM B(\u0001p) = K(\u0001p) = A(\u0001p) (1 \u0001 p < \u221e),\nso that the Brown\u2013McCoy radical is as \u2018small\u2019 as possible in these cases. On the other\nhand, Corollary 4.17 shows that the inclusion in (5.1) may be proper since\nradBM B(J\u2295np ) = W(J\u2295np ) \u0002 A(J\u2295np ) (n \u2208 N, 1 < p < \u221e). (5.2)\nYood observed that the Jacobson radical of B(X)\/A(X) is non-zero for certain Banach\nspaces X (see [31, p. 615]). Kleinecke then defined the ideal of inessential operators by\nE(X) = \u03c0\u22121(radJ(B(X)\/A(X))) (5.3)\nfor each Banach space X, where \u03c0 : B(X) \u2192 B(X)\/A(X) is the quotient homomorphism\n(see [17]). Subsequently, Pietsch gave the \u2018operator ideal\u2019 definition of E(X,Y) that we\nused on p. 526, and showed that it coincides with Kleinecke\u2019s original definition (5.3) for\nX = Y (see [24, 26.7.2] and [17, Theorem 1]).\nIt follows from (5.1) and [23, Theorem 4.5.3(b)] that\n\u03c0\u22121(radBM(B(X)\/A(X))) = radBM B(X) (5.4)\nfor each infinite-dimensional Banach space X. Our aim is to show that\u2014unlike Pietsch\u2019s\nobservation that the assignment X \u0006\u2192 \u03c0\u22121(radJ(B(X)\/A(X))) can be turned into an\noperator ideal E\u2014it is impossible to turn the assignment\nX \u0006\u2192 \u03c0\u22121(radBM(B(X)\/A(X))) = radBM B(X)\ninto an operator ideal. To make this statement precise, we give the following definition.\nDefinition 5.2. Let X \u0006\u2192 JX be an assignment which associates with each infinite-\ndimensional Banach space X an ideal JX in B(X). If there is an operator ideal I such\nthat I(X) = JX for each infinite-dimensional Banach space X, then we say that the\nassignment X \u0006\u2192 JX can be turned into an operator ideal.\nTheorem 5.3. The assignment X \u0006\u2192 radBM B(X) cannot be turned into an operator\nideal.\nProof. Assume towards a contradiction that I is an operator ideal satisfying I(X) =\nradBM B(X) for each infinite-dimensional Banach space X, and take any p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[. It\n538 N. J. Laustsen\nfollows from Proposition 4.4 (iii) that there are operators S : Jp \u2192 \u0001p and T : \u0001p \u2192 Jp\nsuch that ST = I\u0003p . Since\nTS \u2208 PI\u0001p (Jp) \u2286 W(Jp) = radBM B(Jp) = I(Jp),\nwe conclude that\nI\u0003p = S(TS)T \u2208 I(\u0001p) = radBM B(\u0001p),\ncontradicting the fact that radBM B(\u0001p) is a proper ideal in B(\u0001p). \u0002\n6. Maximal ideal structure of B(X)\nThe aim of this section is to construct, for each natural number n, a Banach space X\nsuch that B(X) has exactly n maximal ideals, and each of these n maximal ideals has a\nprescribed codimension from the set {k2 | k \u2208 N} \u222a {\u221e}. Note that, by Wedderburn\u2019s\nTheorem (see [23, Theorem 8.1.1]), the square numbers and infinity are the only possible\ncodimensions of maximal ideals in B(X), and so this result is the \u2018best possible\u2019.\nWe begin with some elementary, but very useful, algebraic observations which extend\nthe work of Volkmann (see [29]). Take an integer n \u0003 2, let W1, . . . ,Wn be vector spaces,\nand set W := W1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Wn. Recall from \u00a7 2 that J1, . . . , Jn are the canonical coordinate\nembeddings and Q1, . . . , Qn are the canonical coordinate projections associated with the\ndirect sum, and consider a subalgebra B of L(W) satisfying\nJjQj \u2208 B (j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}).\nObserve that IW =\n\u2211n\nj=1 JjQj \u2208 B, so that B is unital.\nFor j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, set Bj,k := QjBJk. This is a linear subspace of L(Wk,Wj), and\nfor a linear map T : Wk \u2192 Wj we have: T belongs to Bj,k if and only if JjTQk belongs\nto B. We write Bj instead of Bj,j . This is a unital subalgebra of L(Wj).\nLemma 6.1.\n(i) Let j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, let I be a subset of Bj , and set\nI\u0302 := {T \u2208 B | QjTJj \u2208 I}. (6.1)\nThen Qj I\u0302Jj = I. Moreover, I is an ideal in Bj satisfying\nBj,kBk,j \u2286 I (k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} \\ {j}) (6.2)\nif and only if I\u0302 is an ideal in B.\n(ii) Let I be an ideal in B, and let j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Then\nQjIJj = {T \u2208 Bj | JjTQj \u2208 I},\nand this is an ideal in Bj .\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 539\nIn the following we write I \u0004 A to denote that I is an ideal in an algebra A. For each\nj \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, the set\nIj := {I \u0004 Bj | Bj,kBk,j \u2286 I(k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} \\ {j})}\nof ideals in Bj satisfying (6.2) is a sublattice of the lattice of ideals in Bj , and the set\nI := {I \u0004 B | JjBj,kQk \u2286 I(j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, j \t= k)}\nis a sublattice of the lattice of ideals in B. These lattices are related as follows.\nLemma 6.2. Equip I1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 In with the product order. Then the map\n\u03a5 : (I1, . . . , In) \u0006\u2192\nn\u22c2\nj=1\nI\u0302j , I1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 In \u2192 I,\nwhere I\u0302j is given by (6.1), is an order isomorphism with inverse\n\u03a5\u22121 : I \u0006\u2192 (Q1IJ1, . . . , QnIJn), I \u2192 I1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 In.\nCorollary 6.3.\n(i) Let j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, and let M be a maximal ideal in Bj containing Bj,kBk,j for each\nk \u2208 {1, . . . , n} \\ {j}. Then\n\u03a5 (B1, . . . ,Bj\u22121,M,Bj+1, . . . ,Bn) = {T \u2208 B | QjTJj \u2208 M}\nis a maximal ideal in B.\n(ii) Let N be a maximal ideal in B containing JjBj,kQk whenever j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} are\ndistinct. Then \u03a5\u22121(N ) = (B1, . . . ,Bj\u22121,M,Bj+1, . . . ,Bn) for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\nand some maximal ideal M in Bj .\nWe shall now specialize to the case where W1, . . . ,Wn (and hence W) are Banach\nspaces and B = B(W). Then Bj,k = B(Wk,Wj) for each pair (j, k) \u2208 {1, . . . , n}2.\nWe shall restrict our attention to closed ideals. The lattice isomorphism \u03a5 preserves\nclosed ideals in the strong sense that, for (I1, . . . , In) \u2208 I1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 In, we have that\nI1, . . . , In are closed if and only if \u03a5 (I1, . . . , In) is closed. It follows that we may regard\n\u03a5 as a lattice isomorphism from Icl1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Icln onto Icl, where Icl1 , . . . , Icln and Icl are the\nlattices consisting of the closed ideals belonging to I1, . . . , In and I, respectively.\nWe shall further assume that there are only a \u2018few\u2019 operators between any two spaces\nWj and Wk whenever j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} are distinct. To make this precise, we require\nGonza\u00b4lez\u2019s concept of essentially incomparable Banach spaces defined in the following\nproposition.\nProposition 6.4 (Gonza\u00b4lez [9]). Let X and Y be Banach spaces. Each operator\nfrom X to Y is inessential if and only if each operator from Y to X is inessential.\nIf either (and hence both) of these assertions is satisfied, then X and Y are termed\nessentially incomparable.\n540 N. J. Laustsen\nLemma 6.5. Let W1, . . . ,Wn be pairwise essentially incomparable Banach spaces.\nFor each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, the set\nEj := {I \u0004 B(Wj) | I is closed and E(Wj) \u2286 I}\nis a sublattice of Iclj , and \u03a5 maps E1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 En onto the sublattice\nE := {I \u0004 B(W) | I is closed and E(W) \u2286 I}\nof Icl.\nProof. Let j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n} be distinct. Then Bj,k = E(Wk,Wj) because Wj and Wk\nare essentially incomparable. It follows that Bj,kBk,j \u2286 E(Wj) and JjBj,kQk \u2286 E(W),\nand consequently Ej and E are subsets of Iclj and I\ncl, respectively. It is clear that Ej and\nE are closed under the lattice operations.\nIf (I1, . . . , In) \u2208 E1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 En, then QjE(W)Jj = E(Wj) \u2286 Ij for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\nand hence E(W) \u2286 \u22c2nj=1 I\u0302j = \u03a5 (I1, . . . , In). This shows that \u03a5 (E1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 En) \u2286 E.\nConversely, if I \u2208 E, then E(Wj) = QjE(W)Jj \u2286 QjIJj for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, so\nthat \u03a5\u22121(I) \u2208 E1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 En. \u0002\nThe importance of the above lemma lies in the fact that we can improve the iden-\ntity (5.1) to yield that, for each infinite-dimensional Banach space X, the ideal of inessen-\ntial operators on X is contained in the Brown\u2013McCoy radical of B(X), so that maximal\nideals automatically belong to the lattices Ej and E.\nProposition 6.6. Let X be an infinite-dimensional Banach space. Then\nE(X) \u2286 radBM B(X).\nProof. By [23, Theorem 4.5.9], radJ(B(X)\/A(X)) \u2286 radBM(B(X)\/A(X)), and hence\nthe result follows from (5.3) and (5.4). \u0002\nRemark 6.7. The identity (5.2) gives explicit examples of Banach spaces X for which\nthe inclusion E(X) \u2286 radBM B(X) is proper.\nCorollary 6.8. Let W1, . . . ,Wn be pairwise essentially incomparable, infinite-dimen-\nsional Banach spaces. Then the map\n(j,M) \u0006\u2192 {T \u2208 B(W) | QjTJj \u2208 M},\nn\u22c3\nj=1\n{(j,M) | M maximal ideal in B(Wj)} \u2192 {N | N maximal ideal in B(W)}\nis a bijection.\nWe note in particular the following special case, which improves [29, Satz 2(c)].\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 541\nCorollary 6.9. Let W1, . . . ,Wn be pairwise essentially incomparable, infinite-dimen-\nsional Banach spaces. For each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, let Mj be a subset of B(Wj), and set\nNj := {T \u2208 B(W) | QjTJj \u2208 Mj}.\nThen Mj is the only maximal ideal in B(Wj) for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n} if and only if\nN1, . . . ,Nn are the only maximal ideals in B(W).\nRemark 6.10. The condition that the Banach spaces W1, . . . ,Wn are pairwise essen-\ntially incomparable cannot be removed from the above results. For example, takeW1 = \u0001p\nand W2 = Jp for some p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[. These spaces are not essentially incomparable. We know\nthat K(W1) is the unique maximal ideal in B(W1) and that W(W2) is the unique max-\nimal ideal in B(W2). However, B(W1 \u2295 W2) also has a unique maximal ideal because\nW1 \u2295 W2 is isomorphic to W2 by Lemma 4.2 and Proposition 4.4 (iii). This shows that\nCorollary 6.9 fails in this case.\nThe following fact is a consequence of Remark 3.2; it extends [9, Observation 1(b)].\nLemma 6.11. Let m and n be natural numbers, and let X1, . . . ,Xn and Y1, . . . ,Ym\nbe Banach spaces. Then X1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Xn and Y1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ym are essentially incomparable\nif and only if Xk and Yj are essentially incomparable for each pair (j, k) \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} \u00d7\n{1, . . . , n}.\nWe are now ready to prove our main result; it classifies all the closed ideals in B(X)\ncontaining E(X), where X is a finite direct sum of James spaces and \u0001p-spaces. In par-\nticular it shows that for any choice of finitely many square numbers, there is a Banach\nspace X such that B(X) has maximal ideals of these codimensions; and in addition there\nmay be any finite number of maximal ideals of infinite codimension.\nTheorem 6.12. Let n, m and \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdn be natural numbers, let p1, . . . , pn+m be\ndistinct real numbers with p1, . . . , pn \u2208 ]1,\u221e[ and pn+1, . . . , pn+m \u2208 [1,\u221e[, and set\nX := J\u2295\u03bd1p1 \u2295 J\u2295\u03bd2p2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 J\u2295\u03bdnpn \u2295 \u0001pn+1 \u2295 \u0001pn+2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 \u0001pn+m .\nThen\nEj =\n{\n{I \u0004 B(J\u2295\u03bdjpj ) | I is non-zero and closed}, 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n,\n{K(\u0001pj ),B(\u0001pj )}, n + 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n + m,\n(6.3)\nand \u03a5 is a lattice isomorphism from E1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 En+m onto\nE = {I \u0004 B(X) | I is closed and E(X) \u2286 I}.\nProof. By [21, Theorem 4.5], the Banach spaces Jp1 , . . . ,Jpn , \u0001pn+1 , . . . , \u0001pn+m are\npairwise essentially incomparable. Lemma 6.11 then implies that\nJ\u2295\u03bd1p1 , . . . ,J\n\u2295\u03bdn\npn , \u0001pn+1 , . . . , \u0001pn+m\nare pairwise essentially incomparable.\n542 N. J. Laustsen\nFor j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, A(Jpj ) = E(Jpj ) by Proposition 4.9, and hence A(J\u2295\u03bdjpj ) = E(J\u2295\u03bdjpj )\nby Remark 3.2. It follows that E(J\u2295\u03bdjpj ) is contained in every closed, non-zero ideal in\nB(J\u2295\u03bdjpj ). Theorem 1.1 shows that K(\u0001pj ) = E(\u0001pj ) and that K(\u0001pj ) and B(\u0001pj ) are the\nonly closed, non-zero ideals in B(\u0001pj ) for j \u2208 {n+ 1, . . . , n+m}. This proves (6.3). Now\nthe result follows from Lemma 6.5. \u0002\nCorollary 6.13. Define the Banach space X as in Theorem 6.12. Then there are\nexactly n + m distinct maximal ideals N1, . . . ,Nn+m in the algebra B(X), and they are\ngiven by\nNj =\n{\n{T \u2208 B(X) | QjTJj \u2208 W(J\u2295\u03bdjpj )}, 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n,\n{T \u2208 B(X) | QjTJj \u2208 K(\u0001pj )}, n + 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n + m.\nIn particular Nj has codimension \u03bd2j in B(X) for 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n, whereas Nj has infinite\ncodimension in B(X) for n + 1 \u0001 j \u0001 n + m.\nRemark 6.14.\n(i) The conclusions of Theorem 6.12 and Corollary 6.13 remain true if we replace one\nof the \u0001p-spaces \u0001pn+1 , . . . , \u0001pn+m by c0.\n(ii) Special cases of Theorem 6.12 and Corollary 6.13 are obtained by taking either\nm = 0 or n = 0, that is, leaving out either the \u0001p-spaces \u0001pn+1 , . . . , \u0001pn+m or the\nJames spaces J\u2295\u03bd1p1 , . . . ,J\n\u2295\u03bdn\npn . The latter of these cases is the case considered by\nVolkmann in [29].\n7. Uniqueness of the maximal ideal in B(X) for hereditarily indecomposable\nBanach spaces X\nIn this section we give another example of a class of Banach spaces X such that B(X)\nhas a unique maximal ideal, and this maximal ideal has finite codimension.\nDefinition 7.1. An infinite-dimensional Banach space X is hereditarily indecomposable\nif no closed subspace W of X admits an idempotent operator P : W \u2192 W such that\nneither imP nor kerP is finite dimensional.\nGowers and Maurey\u2019s fundamental results about hereditarily indecomposable Banach\nspaces are that they exist and that\nB(X) = S(X) + CIX (7.1)\nfor each hereditarily indecomposable Banach space X (see [11]).\nProposition 7.2. Let X be a hereditarily indecomposable Banach space. Then S(X)\nis the unique maximal ideal in B(X).\nMore generally, for each natural number n, S(X\u2295n) is the unique maximal ideal in\nB(X\u2295n), and radBM B(X\u2295n) = S(X\u2295n).\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 543\nProof. The ideal S(X) is maximal by (7.1). Proposition 6.6 implies that each maximal\nideal in B(X) contains E(X) and hence S(X). Now the first clause is immediate. The\nsecond clause is proved analogously to Corollary 4.17. \u0002\nRemark 7.3.\n(i) A completely different class of Banach spaces X with the property that the ideal\nof strictly singular operators is the unique maximal ideal in B(X) is described\nin [30, Theorem 6.2], where Whitley proves that this is true for any Banach space X\nsuch that each closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of X contains a subspace which\nis isomorphic to X and complemented in X. Schlumprecht\u2019s space is an interesting\nexample of a Banach space satisfying this condition (see [27]).\n(ii) A result similar to Corollary 6.13 can be obtained by replacing the James spaces\nJp1 , . . . ,Jpn by pairwise essentially incomparable, hereditarily indecomposable\nBanach spaces X1, . . . ,Xn and then applying Proposition 7.2 instead of Corol-\nlary 4.17.\nTo find such spaces, take any hereditarily indecomposable Banach space X1\nand choose a descending chain X1 \u2287 X2 \u2287 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2287 Xn of closed, infinite-\ndimensional subspaces of X1 such that Xj+1 has infinite codimension in Xj for\neach j \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}. It is shown in the proof of Proposition 4.5 in [19] that\nB(Xj ,Xk) = S(Xj ,Xk) for 1 \u0001 j < k \u0001 n, so that the spaces X1, . . . ,Xn are\npairwise essentially incomparable. It follows from [19, Example 5.1] that, for dis-\ntinct numbers p1, . . . , pm \u2208 [1,\u221e[, the Banach spaces X1, . . . ,Xn, \u0001p1 , . . . , \u0001pm are\npairwise essentially incomparable.\n8. Classification of the maximal ideals in B(G) for the Gowers space G\nIn this section we shall display a Banach space G such that the Banach algebra B(G)\nhas infinitely many maximal ideals; specifically, there are 22\n\u21350 distinct maximal ideals\nin B(G), each of codimension one. The Banach space G required for this is a creation of\nGowers, originally designed to solve Banach\u2019s hyperplane problem (see [10]). It has sub-\nsequently been investigated in more detail by Gowers and Maurey in [12, Section (5.1)].\nTheir main result about this space will be stated in Theorem 8.1, below. To do so, we\nrequire some elementary facts about certain operators on Banach spaces with an uncon-\nditional basis.\nLet X be a Banach space with an unconditional basis b = (bn)n\u2208N. Denote by (gn)n\u2208N\nthe associated biorthogonal functionals. The unconditionality of the basis b means that,\nfor each \u03be = (\u03ben)n\u2208N \u2208 \u0001\u221e, there is an operator\n\u2206b(\u03be) : x \u0006\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03bengn(x)bn, X \u2192 X,\nand the norms of these operators are uniformly bounded:\nKb := sup{\u2016\u2206b(\u03be)\u2016 | \u03be \u2208 \u0001\u221e, \u2016\u03be\u2016 \u0001 1} < \u221e.\n544 N. J. Laustsen\nThe assignment \u2206b : \u03be \u0006\u2192 \u2206b(\u03be), \u0001\u221e \u2192 B(X), is clearly linear and multiplicative, so that\n\u2206b is a continuous algebra homomorphism. Moreover, \u2206b has a left inverse:\n\u0393b : T \u0006\u2192 (gn(Tbn))n\u2208N, B(X) \u2192 \u0001\u221e.\nThis is an operator of norm at most Kb; it is not multiplicative. The diagonal operator\ndiagb : B(X) \u2192 B(X) associated with the unconditional basis b is now defined by\ndiagb(T ) := (\u2206b\u0393b)(T ) (T \u2208 B(X)).\nTheorem 8.1 (Gowers [10]; Gowers and Maurey [12]). There is a Banach space\nG with an unconditional basis b such that T \u2212 diagb(T ) is strictly singular for each\nT \u2208 B(G).\nWe shall refer to this Banach space G as the Gowers space. The basis b will be termed\nthe canonical unconditional basis of G. Our analysis of B(G) relies on the following\nelementary lemma.\nLemma 8.2. Let X be a Banach space with an unconditional basis b. For each \u03be \u2208 \u0001\u221e,\nthe following assertions are equivalent.\n(a) \u03be \u2208 c0.\n(b) \u2206b(\u03be) \u2208 A(X).\n(c) \u2206b(\u03be) \u2208 E(X).\nCorollary 8.3. Let b be the canonical unconditional basis of the Gowers space G,\nand let \u03a01 : B(G) \u2192 B(G)\/S(G) and \u03a02 : \u0001\u221e \u2192 \u0001\u221e\/c0 be the quotient homomorphisms.\nThere is a continuous algebra isomorphism \u03a8 : \u0001\u221e\/c0 \u2192 B(G)\/S(G) such that the dia-\ngram\n\u0001\u221e\n\u2206b \u0001\u0001\n\u03a02\n\b\b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b\u000b\n\u000b B(G)\n\u03a01 \u0001\u0001 B(G)\/S(G)\n\u0001\u221e\/c0\n\u223c=\n\u03a8\n\t\t\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\n\f\nis commutative.\nIn order to state the main result of this section, we require some terminology. A\ncharacter on an algebra A is a non-zero algebra homomorphism from A to C. For each\nm \u2208 N, the map (\u03ben)n\u2208N \u0006\u2192 \u03bem, \u0001\u221e \u2192 C, is a character on the algebra \u0001\u221e. These\ncharacters are termed the point evaluations.\nTheorem 8.4. Let G be the Gowers space. Each maximal ideal in B(G) has codimen-\nsion one, and the following five sets are in a bijective correspondence to each other:\n(a) the set of maximal ideals in B(G);\n(b) the set of maximal ideals in \u0001\u221e\/c0;\nMaximal ideals in the algebra of operators on certain Banach spaces 545\n(c) the set of characters on \u0001\u221e that are not point evaluations;\n(d) the set of free ultrafilters on N; and\n(e) the set (\u03b2N) \\ N, where \u03b2N is the Stone\u2013C\u02c7ech compactification of N.\nIn particular there are 22\n\u21350 distinct maximal ideals in B(G).\nProof. Each maximal ideal in B(G) contains S(G) by Proposition 6.6, so the first\nclause and the bijective correspondence between the sets in (a) and (b) follow from\nCorollary 8.3. The bijective correspondence between the sets in (b) and (c) is well known\nand easy to check, whereas the bijective correspondence between the sets in (c), (d)\nand (e) is standard; we refer to [7, Chapters 6\u20137] for details. The final clause follows\nfrom [7, Theorem 9.2]. \u0002\nAcknowledgements. This work was supported by the European Commission under\nMarie Curie Research Grant no. ERBFMBI-CT98-3447.
