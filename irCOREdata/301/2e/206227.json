Introduction \nIn countries with a high contraceptive prevalence the Demographic and Health Surveys \n(DHSs) include a calendar. The DHS calendar consists of a database that recalls \ninformation on union history, pregnancy and fertility, and contraceptive use for each \nmonth during the five years preceding the survey. The main goal of this instrument is to \nprovide longitudinal data on contraceptive use.  In some countries information on \nbreastfeeding, migration and employment has been added.  So far calendar-style data \nhave mainly been used to analyse contraceptive dynamics (Curtis 1997, Goldman et al. \n1989, Leite 1998, Magnani et al. 1996, Steele and Curtis 2001, Strickler et al. 1997; \nWestoff et al. 1990).  To the best of our knowledge only one study (Leone & Hinde, \n2005) has used the union history calendar to analyse the dynamics of union formation \nor dissolution, or combined the union history calendar with that dealing with the history \nof pregnancy and childbearing to examine the relationship between union dynamics and \nfertility. \nThis paper reports an analysis of the relationship between one aspect of union \ndynamics (union dissolution) and fertility in Brazil using data from the 1996 Brazilian \nDemographic and Health Survey calendar.  It explores the biases and the strengths of \nthis data source for the analysis of union histories. It is part of a larger study which aims \nto analyse the relationship between union dynamics as a whole and fertility.  In order to \nallow for an extended discussion of methodological issues linked with the use of the \nDHS union history calendar data, we focus here on the relationship between union \ndissolution and fertility.  In this paper we hypothesise that union instability has a \npositive impact on the level of fertility despite a lower exposure to the risk of \nconceiving. We will discuss this hypothesis in the following sections and the need to \nmodel fertility and union instability jointly. \nIn the next section we explain why the relationship between union dissolution and \nfertility in Brazil is both particularly interesting and theoretically challenging to study.  \nWe then proceed to discuss the use of the union history data in the DHS calendar.  The \nfourth section describes the models which we use to examine the mutual interaction \nbetween union dissolution and fertility.  These models take account of the possibility of \nunobserved characteristics of the women in the sample which simultaneously affect \nboth the risk of childbearing and the risk of a union breaking down.  The fifth section \npresents the results of the models and the last provides a discussion and conclusion. \n \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 159 \n2. Union dissolution and fertility in Brazil  \nBrazil has experienced a steep fertility decline in the last 40 years, the total fertility rate \nfalling from 6.2 in 1960 to 2.0 in 2005 (US Bureau of Census 2005), despite the \nabsence, for much of this period, of a government-sponsored family planning \nprogramme.  Women\u2019s increasing autonomy has played an important role in this \ndecline, and a high reliance on female sterilisation (42% of women aged 15-49 in 1996 \nwere sterilised) is one of its outstanding characteristics (Carvalho and Wong, 1996).   \nBrazilians have for many years commonly formed consensual unions rather than \nformal marriages. But these unions differ from unions in western societies described by \nthe word \u2018cohabitation\u2019 because the partners in Brazilian consensual unions describe \nthemselves as husband and wife, whereas in \u2018cohabiting\u2019 unions the partners define \nthemselves as singles.  In the past two decades, however, Brazilian unions have become \nless stable (that is, more likely to dissolve).  An interesting question is whether this \ntendency towards union instability is part of the reason for the recent fertility decline. \nViewed from the perspective of the proximate determinants of fertility (Bongaarts \nand Potter, 1983), it might be supposed that increased union instability might be \nassociated with women having fewer children.  Other things being equal, increasing \ninstability will lead to a rise in the proportion of the average woman\u2019s childbearing \nyears spent between or after unions and therefore a reduced exposure to the risk of \nconception.  It is also possible that couples might avoid having children if they are \ndoubtful about the future of their relationship in order not to involve their children in \npossible emotional trauma surrounding the separation of the parents. \nHowever, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to suppose that the \nopposite may be the case, especially in a society like Brazil.  Theoretically, for \nexample, it is possible that an increase in the proportion of consensual unions and the \ngrowth of more liberal sexual customs might lead to earlier exposure to the risk of \npregnancy, and therefore higher fertility, unless this is compensated by increasing \ncontraceptive knowledge and use and sterilisation at earlier ages.  In addition, sexual \nactivity could be linked to the stability of the union. If there is a negative relationship \nbetween the frequency of sexual intercourse and the duration of the union, then women \nwhose lives are characterised by several unions might have, overall, a higher exposure \nto the risk of conception than women who only ever have one union because the time \nspent between unions is more than compensated by the increased frequency of \nintercourse during the periods they do spend in union.   \nThere is also empirical evidence from Brazil to support the suggestion that women \nwho have experienced several unions have a higher level of fertility when they are \u2018in \nunion\u2019 than women who have only experienced one union. Women in any age group \nwho have had more than one union report higher levels of fertility than those with only \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n160  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \none union (Figure 1). A qualitative analysis conducted by Greene (1994) showed that it \nis common in Brazil to have a child in each new union to fulfil the idea of having a \nproper family. Husband and wife may wish to have a child together regardless of the \nnumber of children either of them had before. This is particularly true for men who \nleave their children from previous relationships with the mothers (Greene 1994). \n \nFigure 1: Age specific fertility rate (ASFR) by number of unions, Brazil 1996 \n0\n0 . 0 5\n0 . 1\n0 . 1 5\n0 . 2\n0 . 2 5\n0 . 3\n0 . 3 5\n1 5 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 4 2 5 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 4 3 5 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 4 4 5 - 4 9\nA g e  g r o u p\nA\nSF\nR\ns\no n e  u n i o n\nm o r e  th a n  o n e\n  \nSource: Leone, 2002 \n \nThe decision about whether to have a child or not also depends on the stability of \nthe union. Some couples might want a child to strengthen their union (Lillard, 1993), \nand it is not uncommon for Brazilian women who perceive their union to be potentially \nunstable to use pregnancy to try to cement their relationship. This is especially common \namong low-income women, particularly those in consensual unions, who are aware of \nthe fragility of their relationships.  For such women, especially in the early years of a \npartnership, having a child might be a rational strategy for keeping their husbands with \nthem.  The increased stability of unions following the arrival of children is evidence \nthat children do add something positive to the union and\/or that children increase the \ncosts of dissolution.  Previous studies in developed countries have found that it is more \nlikely for couples without children to divorce (Heaton, 1990; Lillard, 1993). The \nfindings of these studies could not be generalised to Latin American countries.  \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 161 \nThe status of Brazilian women is also fundamental to understanding the family \ndynamics underpinning fertility decisions. Brazilian women are still struggling to \nimprove their position within relationships and union dynamics are vital to an \nunderstanding of their childbearing behaviour. The complex mechanisms that link a \nwoman\u2019s autonomy and her bargaining power to union instability and the increase of \ndomestic violence that Brazil is experiencing, should raise more concern in particular \nfrom policy makers regarding this topic.  The culture of \u2018machismo\u2019 is common in \nBrazil and men exhibiting this attitude are often in favour of casual sexual unions with \nlittle or no commitment. It is not uncommon for them to enter into more than one union \nand leave the children they had with the previous partner behind (Greene, 1991; \nHenriques, 1989).  \n \n \n3. Data  \nThe relationship between union dissolution and fertility has been studied in depth in \ndeveloped countries. In particular several studies have analysed the two way \nrelationship that characterises union dynamics and childbearing by applying multi-\nprocess modelling to the relationship between union formation and dissolution and \nfertility (Aassve et al., 2004; Lillard, 1993; Lillard and Waite, 1993; Brien et al., 1999; \nSteele et al. 2005).  The use of multi-process modelling has become attractive because \nit allows the simultaneous incorporation of correlated life course processes in order to \nbetter understand the ways in which people actually live their lives.   An example of a \npair of correlated processes is conception, on the one hand, and union formation and \ndissolution on the other.  The trajectories of the two processes interact: when a woman \nis at risk of entering or leaving a union she is at risk of conceiving as well. The risk of a \nchange of union status may influence the chance of conception, but the risk of \nconception may simultaneously affect the chance of entering or leaving a union.  \nHowever, this type of modelling has not been fully exploited in developing \ncountries mainly due to the lack of data.  In the case of Brazil the most recent data set \ncontaining complete information on union and childbearing histories is the 1984 \nPesquisa Nacional por Amostra Domiciliar (PNAD).  Greene (1994) and Henriques \n(1989) used these data, together with qualitative analysis, to analyse the relationship \nbetween fertility and union instability, but did not apply multi-process modelling.  The \n1996 DHS contains complete reproductive histories, but not complete union histories.  \nNevertheless, we hope to show that it is still possible to use the data in the DHS \ncalendar to apply multi-process modelling to the relationship between fertility and \nunion dissolution. \n \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n162  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n3.1 The DHS calendar data and sample selection \nThe data used for this study come from the 1996 Brazil Demographic and Health \nSurvey (BDHS). The 1996 BDHS interviewed a representative sample of more than \n12,000 eligible women aged between 15 and 49 years. It includes information on \ndemographic and socio-economic characteristics at the household and individual level \n(BEMFAM, 1997). In particular the calendar section is used to model union and \nreproductive histories.  \nThe calendar consists of a matrix of rows and columns in which each row \nrepresents a month and the columns are used to record a particular type of information \nfor each month. At the end of the birth history section the interviewers insert relevant \nbirths in the calendar and add eight months of gestation before each birth. At the same \ntime pregnancies that did not result in live birth are entered. The contraceptive entries \nare therefore checked against the pregnancies that are already inserted in the calendar. \nThe interviewer is allowed to insert only one code in each cell. In this way it is possible \nto record the type of contraceptive method that has been used, for how long and the \nreason why it has been discontinued, along with changes in union status. A woman is \nconsidered in a union if married or in a cohabiting relationship. \nThe main problem with using the DHS datasets for the analysis of union histories \nis that the only information available, beyond that collected in the calendar, is the start \ndate of the first union and whether the woman had experienced no union, one, or more \nthan one union by the time of the interview. No information is available which relates to \nthe period before 1 January 1991 (the BDHS took place in 1996) apart from the start \ndate of the first union. Therefore, women who reported more than one union and who \nwere in their most recent union at the beginning of the calendar period are known to \nhave had at least two unions, but the exact number is not known. For those who started \na union before the beginning of the calendar, we only know the duration of that union if \nthey had only ever been in one union.  \nA consequence of this is that many of the durations of unions extant during the \nperiod of the calendar are left-truncated (we do not know when they began). The way \nthe multi-process model is specified necessitates the elimination of these unions from \nthe exposure time being considered. However, we were concerned to try to extract as \nmuch information as possible from the calendar, and to find ways of minimising the \nproportion of women eliminated because of the left-truncation of union histories. We \ntherefore carefully considered all the possible scenarios for the combinations of \ntruncated and complete unions to try to achieve the maximum total exposure time for \nthe sample. \nThe final exposure time was composed as follows: (1) all unions for women who \nstarted their first union after 1 January 1991 and for whom it is therefore possible to \nreconstruct the starting and ending dates of all unions; (2) the whole of the first union \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 163 \nfor women who reported only one union and were in that union at the beginning of the \ncalendar period; (3) all unions for women who reported more than one union, who \nstarted their first union during the 12 months before the beginning of the calendar \nperiod, who were in union at the beginning of the calendar period, and whose calendar \nhistory indicates that they started a second union within the calendar period (in this case \nwe made the assumption that the union which these women were in at the start of the \ncalendar was their first union, as it was less than 12 months old at the time - we accept \nthat this assumption is somewhat arbitrary, but we felt that it was important to try to \nmake the most of the available data); and (4) all unions started after the calendar period \nbegan for those women that completed their first union before the calendar period \nstarted and for which the duration of the first union is not known because the end date is \nnot known.  \nBecause we are interested in the link between union dissolution and fertility, we \nfurther restrict our analysis to women who are at risk of conception.  Therefore we \ncensored women at the time of sterilisation. We do however include the spells before \nthe time of sterilisation as they were at risk of conceiving. For the same reason, women \nwho said they had never had sexual intercourse have been excluded from the analysis. \nDue to the number of missing values in the variable \u2018age at first sexual intercourse\u2019, we \nassume that all women were at risk of conception during the whole calendar period \neven if they reported their first sexual experience after the beginning of the observation \nperiod. The months during which a woman was pregnant have been excluded from the \nconception analysis. We constructed the birth interval variable considering the time \nbetween births (given the exclusion of the pregnancy months it equals the time between \nconceptions). The birth interval for the first birth starts at menarche. Given the poor \nquality of data on terminations, we concentrate our analysis on conceptions that ended \non live births only.  \nThe excluded sections of the collective histories of the women in the sample fall \nmainly into two groups:  (1) unions extant at the beginning of the calendar period for \nwhich we did not know the start date, because they were not the woman\u2019s first (these \nunions were left truncated); (2) the entire history of women that were not in union at the \nbeginning of the calendar period, for whom we do not know the date of the end of the \nprevious union (these women\u2019s first unions were left-censored), and who did not report \nany other union during the calendar period. Out of 8,663 eligible women of the initial \nsample (that were not sterilised and that had experienced sex), 7,517 women were \nselected with the remaining ones being excluded due to left-censoring and left-\ntruncation.  We define censored cases as those for whom we lack information about the \nduration of a union (for example because the union started before the calendar period \nand the data of the beginning of the union is not known).  Truncated cases are those \nwhere part of the information we have was not useable (for example, where a woman \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n164  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nstarts her second union during the calendar period the useable information starts from \nthe beginning of this second union as we do not know when the previous one ended). \n \n \n3.2 Selection bias due to left-censoring and left-truncation    \nWe are aware of the fact that the exclusion of left-censored and left-truncated cases \ncould lead to potential bias. As an initial approach to the problem the women that have \nbeen excluded were analysed.  They were generally older than the rest of the sample \nand therefore less at risk of conception. Most of them had their last child before the \nbeginning of the calendar period. The following groups of women were excluded from \nthe analysis: (i) women that experienced only one union that ended before the \nbeginning of the calendar (425 women, or 6 per cent of the women who experience only \none union); (ii) women with more than one union who had all their relationships before \nthe beginning of the calendar (65 women, 5 per cent  of the women that experience \nmore than one union); and (iii) women with more than one union who started their last \nunion before the beginning of the calendar period (557 women, 46 per cent of the \nwomen that experience more than one union).   \nIt is clear that the main selection bias is caused by the fact that we exclude half of \nthe women that have experienced more than one union before the survey date but only 6 \nper cent of those who have experienced only one union. \nSeveral authors report the treatment of left-censored cases to be computationally \ndifficult to handle (Allison, 1984; Blossfeld et al., 1989; Kalbfleisch and Prentice, \n1980; Yamaguchi, 1991).  The main reasons for left-censoring being a problem are, first \nif the censored sample is a function of the unknown values of the outcome variable, \nand, second, when there is no pattern to the missing-data mechanism (Yamaguchi, \n1991).  The latter implies that it is not possible to identify easily a criterion to rebuild \nthe missing cases.  Excluding the cases that are left-censored is generally \nrecommended, even though this may lead to a biased sample.  \nOne option that could reveal the actual impact of left-censoring and left truncation \non the results is to select the cases that start their first union during the calendar period \nonly (Yamaguchi, 1991).  In this way a small sample that is not affected is obtained.  \nThe results using this reduced sample can then be compared with the results from the \nwhole sample. This option has been chosen to tackle the problem under study, as it is \nstraightforward and easy to handle. When modelling only the spells included in the \ncalendar period and comparing them with the larger sample, no particular difference \nwas reported. The results for the two samples were very similar, suggesting that the \nexclusion of the left-censored cases does not cause serious bias. It could lead to a bias \nin the intensity of the estimates but not in the direction. \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 165 \n3.3 Variable selection  \nThe variables that have been included in the models are socio-economic and \ndemographic variables that have been found important in previous analyses of fertility \nand union dynamics in Brazil and elsewhere (Chen et al., 1974; Ebanks et al., 1974; \nGreene, 1994; Heaton, 1990; Henriques, 1989; Koo et al., 1984; Lazo, 1994; Onaka and \nYaukey, 1973; Ribeiro, 1993; Weinstein et al., 1990).  The demographic variables \nincluded are: age (time varying); parity (time varying); age at first birth; whether the \nfirst birth was out of wedlock and, if so, whether it was legitimised by a union within \nsix months after the conception; age at first marriage; union order (time varying \nwhether it is the first or higher order union); and number of unions (coded as \u2018zero\u2019, \n\u2018one\u2019 and \u2018more than one\u2019).  We also included the date the women first entered a union, \nand the date when her first child was born, with an extra category added for women \nwith no children. \nCurrent status (the information refers to the time of the survey), as well as time \nvarying variables, have been included in the analysis. Because the values of current \nstatus variables may have changed since the events of interest took place, careful \nconsideration should be given to the interpretation of these variables. However, current \nstatus variables which are likely not to have changed during the period of observation \ncan still provide valuable information, particularly for datasets like the DHS where the \nnumber of time-varying variables is limited.  We have included education, religion, \nethnicity and urban\/rural residence.  It is probably reasonable to assume that the first \nthree of these have not changed since the beginning of the woman\u2019s first union for most \nmembers of our sample.  Urban\/rural residence may have changed, so caution may be \nrequired when interpreting the results for this variable.  Level of education of the \nrespondent has been considered, measured in completed years, rather than in terms of \neducational institutions attended (Lazo, 1994). This choice is the result of previous \ndiscussions with Brazilian demographers who argue that it is better suited to the kind of \neducational system in Brazil. Descriptive statistics for the main variables chosen are \nreported in Table 2. \n \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n166  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTable 1: Descriptive statistics for women and background characteristics \nincluded in the final models \nVariable Percentage of women \n Total Having only one union Having more than one union \nResidence    \nUrban 82.0 80.2 83.2 \nRural 18.0 19.8 16.8 \nRegion    \nRio de Janeiro 9.6 9.3 10.1 \nSao Paulo 21.3 22.1 19.2 \nSul 16.9 18.4 15.5 \nCentro Leste 12.3 12.0 9.0 \nNordeste 27.5 26.0 32.5 \nNorte 4.9 4.4 5.2 \nCentro Oeste 7.6 7.8 8.5 \nAge at first sex    \nLess than 18 years 42.2 38.9 63.6 \n18 years or more 57.8 61.1 36.4 \nReligion    \nChristian (Catholic) 76.7 76.9 72.8 \nNo religion 4.4 4.1 6.3 \nAny other faith 19.3 19.0 20.9 \nParity    \n0 8.1 4.3 8.7 \n1-2 48.6 34.8 46.8 \n3+ 45.1 42.7 60.9 \nEthnicity    \nWhite 44.4 46.0 33.9 \nMixed 50.9 49.7 58.9 \nOther 4.7 4.3 7.2 \n \n \n4. The model \nMulti-process modelling is useful when one outcome may affect the other one. In that \ncase a simple one-equation model might not explain the variation fully. In this type of \nmodel, the simultaneity of the events is considered by correlating the unobserved \nheterogeneity of the different processes. In particular, recent literature (Lillard, 1993; \nLillard and Panis, 1998; Lillard and Waite, 1993) has concentrated on simultaneity in \nhazard processes. Simultaneous models are useful when the hazard rate of one process \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 167 \ndepends on the hazard of another process or on the actual current state or prior \noutcomes of a related multi-episode process. The analysis of this paper is based on \nLillard\u2019s (1993) multi-process model.  \nSpecifically, our model consists of two equations, one for union dissolution and a \nsecond for conception within unions.  Both equations define continuous-time event \nhistory models.  The union dissolution equation may be written as follows: \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6log ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )d d dl l l l lh t C t A t D t P t K t X t\u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b5= + + + + + + +  \n \nwhere log ( )dlh t is the hazard of union dissolution d for a woman\u2019s lth union at time t. \nTime is measured in months since the beginning of the union. The variables on the \nright-hand side of this equation fall into several groups.  First, there are three variables \nthat increase with duration within each union we are considering (these can be \ndescribed as \u2018clock\u2019 variables): the length of the interval since the previous birth, )(tCl , \nthe woman\u2019s age, )(tA , and the duration of the current union, )(tDl .  These three \nvariables were specified as piecewise linear splines.  The entire interval under \nobservation was divided into sub-intervals and the hazard assumed to vary as a linear \nfunction of duration within each of these sub-intervals.  A range of subdivisions of the \ninterval was tried.  Second, there are two variables which describe the history of the \nrelated birth process: ( )lP t  is a binary variable measuring the woman\u2019s pregnancy \nstatus at time t, and ( )lK t  is the number of children the woman has at time t.  Third, \nthere is a vector of exogenous variables, )(tX d , some of which may be time-varying.  \nBecause one woman may have more than one union, and therefore contribute more than \none case to the analysis, some of the variables on the right-hand side will vary between \nunions for the same women.  These are indexed by the subscript l.  The term d\u03b5  \nmeasures the woman-specific residual (heterogeneity) affecting the hazard of leaving a \nunion and it is normally distributed: ),0(~ 2dNd \u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 .  This error term is correlated across \nall unions for the same woman.  The conception equation is:  \n \n0 2 3 4 4 5 6log ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )c c cl lh t C t A t D t U K X t\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b5= + + + + + + +   \n \nwhere log ( )clh t is the hazard of conception c leading to a live birth during a woman\u2019s \nlth union at time t, C(t) is the duration since the previous birth, lU  denotes whether the \ncurrent union l is a first or higher-order union, K is the woman\u2019s parity, ( )cX t  is a \nvector of (possibly time-varying) exogenous variables, and c\u03b5  is a woman-specific \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n168  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nresidual (heterogeneity) affecting the hazard of conception, which is normally \ndistributed: ),0(~ 2cNc \u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 .   \nThe model as specified above is based on the assumption that all sources of \ncorrelation between the two processes are captured by the correlation between the \nunmeasured components d\u03b5  and c\u03b5 .  Conditional on these, the outcomes of the two \nprocesses are independent except for the effects of the status and the cumulative \noutcome of the other process.   \nFully simultaneous models, in which there is a reciprocal relationship between the \noutcomes, are a specific subclass of multi-process models. In these models, the \nsimultaneity is expressed by the inclusion of one hazard in the other equation.  In such \nmodels, there is a need to have at least one variable in each of the vectors )(tX d  and \n( )cX t  which is not in the other and which can be used to identify the model.  Our \nmodel is not of this type, so the inclusion of such variables is unnecessary (Brien, et al., \n1999). \nEstimation of the equations was achieved by Full Information Maximum \nLikelihood (Lillard, 1993).  We began by fitting single equation models that included \nthe fixed effects only. In a second stage, the unobserved heterogeneity was introduced \nseparately to each equation in the model (we describe these as \u2018single equation random \neffects\u2019 models).  Finally, the two equations were estimated jointly (the \u2018joint\u2019 model).  \nOur modelling strategy was to begin by including all exogenous variables in each \nequation and eliminating those which did not achieve statistical significance at the 10 \nper cent level.  We also considered several interactions, but none was found to be \nstatistically significant.  \n \n \n5. Results \nTo present the results, we begin by examining the estimated variances of the woman-\nspecific error terms in each equation and the correlation between d\u03b5  and c\u03b5  (Table 3).  \nWhen the two equations were estimated separately, the woman-specific error variances \nwere statistically significantly different from zero, demonstrating that there is a strong \nunobserved, possibly behavioural, component that is not represented by the variables \nthat have been included in the model.  The magnitude of these variances did not change \ngreatly when the correlation between the two processes was allowed for, but the joint \nestimation revealed a positive correlation between d\u03b5  and c\u03b5  of 0.659.  Women with a \nhigh risk of union dissolution (on unobserved factors) also tend to have a high \nprobability of conceiving during a union or, in other words, women who have a \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 169 \ntendency towards unstable unions also have a tendency towards short conception \nintervals.  That is, there are some unobserved woman-specific characteristics that have a \npositive effect on both the risk of her unions dissolving and her hazard of a conception.  \nThis result confirms our hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between union \ninstability and conception outcomes. The relationship does not tell us the direction of \nthe causality but it would be fair to assume that the instability of the relationship leads \nto a higher level of fertility. This is mainly due to an imbalanced relationship within the \ncouple where women feel that having a child could raise their chances to keep their \npartner (Greene, 1991). \n \nTable 2: Heterogeneity components of all the models and correlation of the \nresiduals from the joint model \nModel Union dissolution \n2\nd\u03b5\n\u03c3  \nConception \n2\nc\u03b5\n\u03c3  \nCorrelation between \nd\u03b5  and c\u03b5  \nSingle-process model 1.231 \n   (0.140) \n0.919 \n   (0.035)  \nJoint model 1.435 \n   (0.123) \n1.056 \n   (0.054) \n0.659 \n   (0.073) \n \nNote. Standard errors are in brackets  \n \nConsider now the results for the model of union dissolution (Table 4).  As \nexpected, the effect of union duration changes markedly when the woman-specific \nheterogeneity term is added to the model.  In the model without the heterogeneity term, \nthe sample is increasingly composed at longer durations of women with a low \nunobserved propensity to dissolve their unions, hence the decline in the risk of \ndissolution as duration increases (at least up to duration eight years).  Once this \nunmeasured propensity is controlled for, the impact of duration on the risk of \ndissolution becomes statistically insignificant.  The effect of a woman\u2019s age also \nchanges when the woman-specific heterogeneity term is added.  In the fixed-effects \nmodel the risk of dissolution increases with age, but this is because at older ages the \nsample contains relatively more women with a high propensity to dissolve their unions.  \nOnce this is controlled for, the effect of age changes so that higher risks of dissolution \nare found among very young women and older women, with the lowest risks at ages \nabout 25 years.  As expected, women who are in their second or higher order union \nhave a higher probability of splitting up with their partners (Heaton, 1990). This \nbehavioural effect is emphasised when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. \n \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n170  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTable 3: Parameter estimates and standard errors in union dissolution models \nVariable Single-equation \nmodel with fixed \neffects only \nSingle-equation model \nwith woman-specific \nrandom effect \nJoint model \nwith conception \nN \nUnion duration spline    \n0-12 months -0.021 (0.014) 0.010 (0.017) 0.013 (0.018)  \n1-7 years -0.010 (0.003) -0.001 (0.003) -0.002 (0.003)  \n8-14 years 0.000 (0.002) -0.003 (0.003) -0.003 (0.003)  \n15 years and over 0.004 (0.002) 0.001 (0.002) 0.001 (0.002)  \n   \n  \nAge spline     \n12-20 years 0.008 (0.002) -0.012 (0.005) -0.006 (0.005)  \n20-25 years 0.008 (0.004) -0.006 (0.003) -0.004 (0.003)  \n25-35 years 0.004 (0.002) 0.003 (0.002) 0.003 (0.002)  \n35 years and over 0.001 (0.001) 0.008 (0.002) 0.009 (0.002)  \n    \n \nBirth interval spline    \n0-18 months -0.012 (0.004) 0.006 (0.029) 0.002 (0.030)  \n18-60 months -0.008 (0.002) -0.001 (0.005) 0.002 (0.005)  \n5-10 years 0.002 (0.001) -0.013 (0.003) -0.013 (0.003)  \n10 years and over 0.006 (0.002) 0.005 (0.001) 0.005 (0.001)  \n     \nUnion history     \nTwo or more unions 2.077 (0.111) 2.607 (0.157) 2.712 (0.178) 568 \n     \nFertility status     \nPregnant 1.008 (0.117) 1.377 (0.130) 0.962 (0.141) 3,066 \nWith children 0.914 (0.092) 1.394 (0.121) 1.069 (0.112) 2,725 \n    \n \nEducation  0.068 (0.011) 0.093 (0.014) 0.102 (0.015)  \n    \n \nResidence     \nUrban  0.718 (0.126) 0.844 (0.149) 0.844 (0.149) 5,974 \n     \nFirst sex took place \nbefore age 18 years \n0.193 (0.090) 0.347 (0.101) 0.344 (0.120) 4,181 \nFirst birth out of \nwedlock \n0.078 (0.088) 0.116 (0.113) 0.160 (0.116) 1,774 \nConstant -5.145 (0.872) -6.852 (1.285) -8.509 (1.185)  \n     \nlog-likelihood -5,676 -5,703 -28,424 7,548 \n \nNote:  Standard errors are in brackets. \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 171 \nWe now turn to the effect of fertility on the risk of union dissolution.  In the single-\nequation fixed-effects model the risk of dissolution is relatively high shortly after a \nbirth, but (assuming there are no further births) falls to a minimum round about the \nyoungest child\u2019s fifth birthday before rising again (figure 2).  Once unobservables are \ncontrolled for, the effect of the time since the last birth remains relatively high until the \nyoungest child is about five years old, and then falls, reaching a minimum when the \nyoungest child is about ten years old.   \n \nFigure 2: Baseline hazard of union dissolution by birth interval \n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\n1.20\n1.40\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nBirth interval (years)\nB\nas\nel\nin\ne \nha\nza\nrd\nNo heterogeneity\nNo endogeneity\nJoint\n \nDuring pregnancy there is a higher risk of union dissolution.  This is a very \ninteresting result and it might reflect an increased tendency for a couple to split up \nwhen faced with the stresses of a prospective new child. It is also possible that some \nwoman might have become pregnant in order to keep a relationship, but their partners \nwould not stay. It should be noted that here we make no distinction between \npregnancies that lead to a stillbirth, abortion or miscarriage and those that lead to a live \nbirth. However it would be interesting in future research, in particular in the Latin \nAmerican context, to examine the relationship between union dissolution and the \ndecision to go on with a pregnancy.  We cannot examine this here because we cannot \ndistinguish between pregnancies which end in miscarriage and those which end in \ninduced abortion.  Despite previous findings, our model shows a higher risk of \ndissolution for couples that have children.   \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n172  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nIn the single-equation models, the effect of both pregnancy and having children is \ngreater when woman-specific unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for.  The \nexplanation of this is that women who are pregnant or already have children have a \nlower unobserved propensity to end their unions than those women who are not \npregnant and do not have children.  If we control for this, the effect of being pregnant or \nalready having a child on the hazard of dissolution is increased.  However, somewhat \nparadoxically the positive residual correlation between the risk of dissolution and the \nrisk of conception means that women who have a high risk of dissolution are also more \nlikely to become pregnant, and hence already to have children.  In other words, women \nwho are pregnant are selected for being at high risk of dissolution. This selection effect \nexplains why in the joint model the effect of pregnancy and previous childbearing is \nlower than in the single-equation model controlling for unobserved heterogeneity.   \nWomen that had their first sexual intercourse before the age of 18 show a higher \nrisk of union dissolution. These women are more likely to be those that conceive a child \nearlier and enter into their first union earlier.  It is interesting to note that they also have \na lower unobserved tendency to end their unions (so that the effect of early sexual \ninitiation grows stronger after controlling for woman-specific heterogeneity). \nHowever, whether the first birth took place \u2018out of wedlock\u2019 has no significant \nimpact on the risk of future union dissolution.  In the Brazilian context this would be \nexpected as consensual unions are comparable to formal unions and therefore an out of \nwedlock birth would not be any different from a birth within a formal union. Finally, \neducation and urban residence are both positively associated with the risk of \ndissolution. \n \nTable 4: Parameter estimates and standard errors in conception models \nVariable Single-equation \nmodel with fixed \neffects only \nSingle-equation model \nwith woman-specific \nrandom effect \nJoint model \nwith union \ndissolution \nN \nUnion duration spline    \n0-12 months 0.023 (0.023) 0.027 (0.024) 0.027 (0.024)  \n1-7 years -0.004 (0.001) -0.003 (0.001) -0.003 (0.001)  \n8-14 years 0.000 (0.001) -0.000 (0.001) -0.000 (0.001)  \n15 years and over 0.001 (0.000) 0.001 (0.001) 0.001 (0.001)  \n   \n  \nAge spline     \n12-20 years 0.018 (0.002) 0.018 (0.002) 0.019 (0.002)  \n20-25 years -0.004 (0.001) -0.001 (0.001) -0.001 (0.001)  \n25-35 years -0.006 (0.001) -0.006 (0.001) -0.006 (0.001)  \n35 years and over -0.016 (0.001) -0.018 (0.002) -0.018 (0.002)  \n    \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 173 \nTable 4: (continued) \nVariable Single-equation \nmodel with fixed \neffects only \nSingle-equation model \nwith woman-specific \nrandom effect \nJoint model \nwith union \ndissolution \nN \nBirth interval spline     \n0-18 months 0.010 (0.004) 0.027 (0.005) 0.036 (0.005)  \n18-60 months -0.000 (0.001) 0.007 (0.002) 0.006 (0.002)  \n5-10 years 0.010 (0.001) 0.015 (0.001) 0.016 (0.002)  \n10 years and over -0.002 (0.001) -0.002 (0.001) -0.003 (0.001)  \n     \nUnion history     \nIn second or higher \norder union \n0.478 (0.075) 0.527 (0.099) 0.586 (0.104) 465 \n     \nParity     \n1-2 children 0.027 (0.072) 0.077 (0.091) 0.158 (0.095) 4,026 \n3 or more children 0.043 (0.091) -0.094 (0.119) -0.003 (0.124) 2,046 \n    \n \nEducation  -0.015 (0.005) -0.031 (0.007) -0.030 (0.008)  \n    \n \nFirst birth out of \nwedlock \n0.049 (0.044) 0.099 (0.059) 0.103 (0.062) 1,833 \n     \nReligion     \nNo religion 0.415 (0.085) 0.527 (0.122) 0.516 (0.125) 378 \nOther faiths 0.125 (0.049) 0.117 (0.066) 0.124 (0.069) 1,148 \n     \nEthnicity     \nMixed 0.151 (0.038) 0.229 (0.052) 0.247 (0.055) 4,210 \nOther 0.095 (0.089) 0.076 (0.121) 0.099 (0.127) 331 \n     \nRegion     \nNorth 0.491 (0.045) 0.645 (0.062) 0.652 (0.065) 3,688 \nCentre 0.332 (0.051) 0.448 (0.067) 0.476 (0.072) 1,851 \n     \nConstant -8.545 (0.456) -9.468 (0.508) -9.893 (0.514)  \n     \nlog-likelihood -22,868 -22,657 -28,380 7,548 \n \nNote: Standard errors are in brackets.  \n \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n174  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nWe now turn to the results of the conception model (Table 5).  The effect of a \nwoman\u2019s age is as expected (Figure 3).  The risk of conception increases with age up to \nabout 20 years and then falls.  The fall is rather more rapid in the single equation model \nwithout unobserved heterogeneity than in the other two models.  This is probably \nbecause of the effect of secondary sterility and subfecundity.  As age rises, an \nincreasing proportion of women suffer from these conditions.  In the single-equation \nfixed effect model, this is not controlled, whereas in the other models it is taken account \nof in the random effect. \n \nFigure 3: Baseline hazard of conception by age \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39\nAge\nB\nas\nel\nin\ne \nH\naz\nar\nd \nNo heterogeneity\nNo endogeneity\nJoint\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n \nThe effect of union duration is quite weak (figure 4), and similar in all three \nmodels.  The risk of conception initially increases to a maximum at around 12 months \nand then falls gradually.  This pattern almost certainly reflects the fact that couples tend \nto want to bear a child fairly quickly after forming a new union, and the peak duration is \nrelated to the average waiting time to conception.  Clearly, the female partner in more \nfecund couples will conceive earlier than her counterpart in less fecund couples, and the \neffect of fecundity is revealed in the results for birth interval.  After controlling for \nunion duration, the risk of conception varies little in the single equation model, but \nincreases with birth interval length in the random effects and joint models, probably \nalso because these models control for woman-specific unobserved fecundity. \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 175 \nFigure 4 Baseline hazard of conception by union duration \n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n0 3 6 9 12 15\nUnion duration\nB\nas\nel\nin\ne \nha\nza\nrd\n \nNo Heterogeneity\nNo endogeneity\nJoint\n \n \nIf a woman is in her second or higher order union her hazard of conception is \nhigher, a risk which is increased still further in the joint model.  The effect of parity, \nhowever, is insignificant once the other covariates in the model are controlled.  Women \ncould remain pregnant in order to keep their relationship regardless of parity. Their \nbehaviour could be the same at any stage of their reproductive life but it is more likely \nthat this kind of behaviour is linked to the number of unions the women had. \nEducation is negatively associated with the risk of conception, and its effect is \nstronger when woman-specific unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for.  It seems that \nwomen with more education tend to have a higher unobserved propensity to conceive \nthan do women with less education.  This attenuates the effect of education in the single \nequation model with fixed effects.  Compared with Roman Catholic women (the \nreference category), those of no religion and, to a lesser extent, those of other faiths, \nhave a higher risk of conception. This confirms the findings of previous research \n(Greene, 1991; Henriques, 1987; Leone, 2002) that Catholicism is not particularly \nstrongly felt in Brazilians\u2019 lives. Women with no religious beliefs and those belonging \nto spiritual groups show a higher risk of conception than Catholics. The Catholic group \nwas probably the first one to experience the fertility transition, and had the steepest \ndecline. At the same time it is possible that Catholic women delay their first conception, \nwith a negative effect on the hazard of conception. \nLeone & Hinde: Fertility and union dissolution in Brazil \n176  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nThe same is true of women of mixed ethnicity when compared with whites (the \nreference category). Geographical variations in the risk of conception are also evident: \nwomen in the north and centre of Brazil have higher fertility levels than do those in the \nsouth (the reference category). \nIn the case of the risk of conception, the results from the joint model are rather \nsimilar to those from the single equation random effects model, though there are \ndifferences between the two single equation models in the magnitude of the effects of \ncertain covariates, notably region, being of mixed ethnicity, and being of no religion.   \n \n \n6. Discussion and conclusion \nThe most important result of this analysis is the demonstration that there is a significant \npositive relationship between union status change and fertility in Brazil. In particular \nthe joint model has shown that there is a positive residual correlation between the risk \nof union dissolution and the associated hazard of conceiving. Thus the results have \nconfirmed the importance of modelling events jointly in order to highlight the \ninteraction of the events. \nBrazilian women in second or higher order unions show a higher risk of \nconceiving, in particular when modelling the outcome jointly with union dissolution.  \nThe modelling highlights the need for more information on union dynamics. In \nparticular the DHS calendar does not give enough information on union histories \npreceding the calendar period. The calendar could be improved but there would still be \nthe need for retrospective data with full information on union and childbearing \nhistories. In addition more research is needed on the impact of union instability on \nconceptions according to the outcome (i.e.: terminations vs. live births). \nBrazilian policy makers have too often regarded information on union histories as \nirrelevant.  However the results of this analysis have a clear relevance for policy \nmakers. The increasing risk of union dissolution during pregnancy could be a sign of \nthe use of conception to keep the partner. This is particularly so for lower income \nclasses. Despite the increase of women\u2019s autonomy in Brazil, relationships are still \nstrongly controlled by the man. Women\u2019s bargaining power might be reduced to \nconception. In light of these issues more attention should be given in future to policies \nthat regard women and families more in general. \nThe lack of studies in Brazil analysing the relationship between union dynamics \nand fertility is mainly due to the lack of suitable data. The calendar section on union \nhistories of the DHS could be a good source of information if improved. Too often, \nunion dynamics are underrated for the impact that they can have on fertility in general \nand contraceptive dynamics in particular.  \nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 7 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 177 \nThe calendar data could be a valuable source of information for those countries \nlike Brazil where there is no other information on union dynamics. This type of analysis \ncould be replicated for other Latin American countries. The DHS that was planned for \n2001 did not include the calendar section. Most researchers in Brazil claim that it is too \ndifficult to handle and due to their limitations, the data do not justify complex analysis.  \nThe main limitations of this analysis derive from the lack of full information in the \nDHS calendar. We feel that, in the future, more information should be added to the \ncalendar and to the cross-sectional section as well. The calendar information could be \nimproved simply by reporting the order of the union in the union section. So, the \nsymbol \u2018X\u2019 would be replaced by the union order number. This would not add further \nstress to the interviewees, but would add important information to the dataset. \nFurthermore, in the case of the variable that reports the number of unions, it would be \nuseful to report the actual number of unions instead of reporting the category \u2018more \nthan one union\u2019. Ideally, for each union a start and an end date with the number of \nbirths in each union should be included. This information would allow us to reconstruct \ncomplete union histories along with reproductive histories. In practice however, it may \nprove impracticable to collect this information.  \nWe do believe that this analysis could be replicated in other countries that have \ncalendar data. In particular it would be important in Latin American countries where \noften data on both fertility and union dynamics are poor. \n \n \n7.
