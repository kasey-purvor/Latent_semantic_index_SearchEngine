Less tangibly but no less significantly, cultural \nintermediaries also operate at the boundary between the social categories of production \nand consumption, reflexively negotiating between their roles as symbolic producers of \nadded-value, and high-involvement, taste-leading consumers. Existing research has \npositioned cultural intermediaries as liminal figures, mediating between production and \nconsumption (e.g. Cronin, 2004; Entwistle, 2006; Smith Maguire, 2008; Wright, 2005). \nHowever, the active accomplishment of their liminality\u2014and associated constructions of \neconomic value and occupational identity\u2014remains largely unexplored in the field of \nmarketing studies. \n \n2 \nThis article examines the liminality of cultural intermediaries through a case study of \nwine promoters, including wine makers, publicists, retailers, distributors, and writers. The \nemphasis, here, is on how the promoters\u2018 narratives about their work practices and \npersonal preferences reveal the ongoing and potentially ambivalent negotiations that \noccur between their various positions within the field of wine. The article thus offers a \ndistinctive account of boundary work in practice: how identities and categories emerge \nout of the \u2017betwixt and between\u2018 (Turner, 1995: 95) of production and consumption. As \npart of emerging research on the subjectivity and \u2017inside view\u2018 of market practitioners \n(Cook, 2006), the article contributes a crucial perspective on the relationship between \nproduction and consumption, which has yet to be fully developed in discussions of \u2017value \nco-creation\u2018 (e.g. Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2000), and the \u2017prosumer.\u2018 Like prosumers, \nwho contribute (unpaid) creative and affective labour to the creation of value (e.g. \nTapscott and Williams, 2007), cultural intermediaries are reflexive producer\/consumers \nfor whom the market and culture are inseparable (Slater, 2002); unlike prosumers, \ncultural intermediaries draw on their cultural capital and affective capacities to do their \npaid work of making calculations about\u2014and ideally better managing\u2014the reflexivity of \nother consumers (cf. Moor, 2008; Soar, 2000). To study cultural intermediaries is thus to \nstudy key agents charged with the \u2017governmental\u2018 mobilization of consumers (Miller and \nRose, 1997; Zwick et al., 2008). \n \nThe analysis focuses on wine promoters\u2018 various conceptualizations and mobilizations of \nprovenance with regard both to their work as symbolic producers on behalf of particular \nwines, and to their identities as reflexive producer\/consumers. Provenance is a logical \nchoice for an empirical lens through which to explore wine promoters\u2018 producing and \nconsuming narratives. Origin-based quality claims are well-established for food and wine \n(cf. Amilien and Holt, 2007; Thode and Maskulka, 1998). Traditionally for wine, this \ntakes the form of terroir: the contention that wines reflect the local, physical conditions \n(climate, topography, soil) of production. However, this traditionalist view of terroir\u2014as \na trait intrinsic to agricultural products\u2014is increasingly challenged in the wine market by \nstrategic constructions of provenance\u2014as a marketing tool encompassing notions of \ncultural and regional heritage, personality and authenticity (Charters, 2006; Vaudour, \n2002). Past research on the marketing of wine through provenance has typically focused \non producers\u2018 branding strategies (e.g. Beverland, 2005) or consumers\u2018 understandings \n(e.g. Tustin and Lockshin, 2001); the roles of the cultural intermediaries who bridge these \ntwo realms remain largely unexplored. \n \nFurthermore, provenance is a timely issue, related to ongoing discussions of the market \nvalue of origins, authenticity and heritage (e.g. Kirschenblatt-Gimblett, 1998; Pe\u00f1aloza, \n2000; Peterson, 2005; Zukin, forthcoming). Economic value is being extracted from \nconstructions of provenance in an increasing range of consumer fields well beyond those \nof food and wine, from place branding for cities and countries (e.g. Morgan et al., 2001), \nto the use of accountable supply chains to distinguish fashion goods (Moor and Littler, \n2008; Sinopoli and Verner, 2008), and the use of assembly location to imbue products \nsuch as automobiles with an authentic essence (anon., 2007). Thus, how the issue of \n\u2017where things come from\u2018 is framed and understood by wine promoters can shed light, \n3 \nmore broadly, on processes of value construction and the attitudes of a niche of high-\ninvolvement consumers. \n \nThe article proceeds with an overview of the literature on cultural intermediaries, \nhighlighting the foundation provided by Pierre Bourdieu (1984), and more recent \n\u2017cultural economy\u2018 (du Gay and Pryke, 2002) case studies of such occupations, which \nshare a concern with the ways in which the boundaries between culture and economy are \naccomplished. Following a description of the methods used in the research, the discussion \nthen turns to the different ways in which provenance was articulated in the wine \npromoters\u2018 narratives, relative to their roles as symbolic producers and reflexive \nproducer\/consumers. \n \nCultural Intermediaries \nBourdieu typically serves as the starting point for research on cultural intermediaries. In \nDistinction (1984), Bourdieu draws on large-scale survey data of French consumers\u2018 \npreferences and behaviours from the late 1960s and early 1970s to explore social class as \na crucible for shaping tastes and practices, and the role of consumption in processes of \nsocial differentiation. Of particular interest are the new petite bourgeoisie, whose social \nposition and the interplay between their stocks of economic and cultural capital give rise \nto an ethos of self-investment and self-presentation, and a conspicuous affinity for \nconsumer culture. Exemplars of the new petite bourgeoisie are the cultural \nintermediaries, working in: \noccupations involving presentation and representation (sales, marketing, \nadvertising, public relations, fashion, decoration and so forth) and in all the \ninstitutions providing symbolic goods and services. These include the various jobs \nin medical and social assistance\u2026and in cultural production and organization \n(Bourdieu, 1984: 359). \nOf note are the ways in which the new petite bourgeoisie are involved not only in the \nproduction but also legitimation of cultural goods\u2014for it is through such validation that \nthey hope to consolidate their own social position, relative to (and against) the established \ndominant, middle and working classes. Legitimacy, however, takes a different form than \nthat wielded by the established dominant class and their occupations. Rather than the \nbinding authority of the state or the rational authority of traditional professions such as \nmedicine and law, cultural intermediaries employ embodied capital and subjective \nknowledge\u2014e.g. physical appearances, aesthetic attitudes, leisure practices\u2014to \nlegitimate their advice and influence over others.  \n \nCultural intermediaries are regarded as significant in the social dynamics of markets \nbecause of their personal and professional investments in the cultural goods and services \nthey promote. They produce symbolic added-value by disseminating, and converting \nothers to, their belief in consumer goods and services as legitimate markers of social \nstatus and repositories of cultural value. It is this proselytizing aspect of their work that \nleads Bourdieu (1984: 365) and others to suggest that cultural intermediaries act as the \n\u2017transmission belt\u2018 of a new consumer morality, and the lynchpin for a post-Fordist \nconsumer culture and service economy (e.g. Florida, 2002; Lash and Urry, 1994).  \n \n4 \nTempering such grand claims is a growing body of empirical research on how cultural \nintermediaries are implicated in the mutual constitution of production and consumption in \nfields such as advertising and branding (Cronin, 2004; McFall, 2004; Moor, 2008; Soar, \n2000); magazine publishing (Crewe, 2003); book retailing (Wright, 2005); and fashion \n(Entwistle, 2006; Pettinger, 2004; Skov, 2002). Often falling under the banner of \u2017cultural \neconomy\u2018 (du Gay and Pryke, 2002), such work understands economy and culture as \ndynamic and mutually iterative categories. Cultural economic analyses draw from the \nanthropology of science and techniques (AST), actor-network theory (ANT) and \nFoucault\u2018s work on governmentality (McFall, 2004: 63, 82-3) to indicate \u2017the ways in \nwhich objects and persons are constituted through the discourses and techniques used to \ndescribe them and to act upon them\u2018 (du Gay, 2004: 100). Such a perspective rejects the \nnotion of a contemporary blurring or hybridization of boundaries, as it posits a radical \nbreak from an earlier era of static categories; instead, the pertinent question is how the \nboundaries between categories such as \u2017economy\u2018 and \u2017culture,\u2018 \u2017production\u2018 and \n\u2017consumption\u2018 (among others) are accomplished, dialectically, through specific, material \npractices. \n \nAs such, this research regards production and consumption as having a liminal \nrelationship. To describe production and consumption as liminal is to insist on an area of \n\u2017active mediation\u2018 (Aguirre, Quance and Sutton, 2000: 30) between the two, in which \nindividuals engage in practices, construct narratives and employ dispositions that place \nthe realms in dialogue (in such a way that may be (mis)diagnosed as a \u2017new\u2018 blurring of \nboundaries), while at the same time accomplishing a division between them (Latour, \n1993). Anthropological discussions frame liminality as a portal to and conduit for the \nexperience of communitas\u2014the shared, spontaneous social bond that exists in the \ninterstitial spaces of the conventional social structure (Turner, 1995: 129). Such \nexperiences of connectedness\u2014with and through products\u2014are understood as powerful \ngenerators of value in critical marketing discussions of value co-creation (Arvidsson, \n2005). Therein lies the importance of the cultural intermediaries, who draw upon their \nsimultaneous position as symbolic producers and high-involvement consumers in order to \nengineer experiences of communitas for other consumers. If the liminal spaces and \n\u2017betwixt and between\u2018 (Turner, 1995: 95) figures were typically outside of a tribal \nsociety\u2018s everyday status order, they are, now, increasingly central to it: the hippie\u2018s \nmarginal status has made him or her a coveted \u2017cool hunter\u2018 in today\u2018s \u2017hip\u2018 marketplace \n(Frank, 1997).  \n \nHence, the empirical interest in cultural intermediaries as liminal personae, actively \nmediating between production and consumption, forging opportunities for connectedness, \nmeaning and value out of such mediations. Their liminality is not simply a matter of \nmediating, objectively, between producers of material products and their end consumers, \nbut also, subjectively, between their roles as producers and consumers. Their subjective \npreferences and personal lifestyle form a crucial occupational resource\u2014a fount of expert \nknowledge, bestowing legitimacy on cultural intermediaries\u2018 goods or services, and on \ntheir authority as arbiters of taste and style. Cultural intermediaries are thus understood as \nreflexive producer\/consumers, for whom categories such as work and leisure seem to \noverlap. Consider, for example, the role of physique, apparel and sexuality in \n5 \ndemonstrating the occupational competence and credibility for, respectively, personal \ntrainers (Smith Maguire, 2008), fashion retail assistants (Pettinger, 2004), and \u2017gay \nmarket\u2018 marketing professionals (Sender, 2004). The crux of the matter is not that work \nand leisure, production and consumption overlap (which, in itself, is unremarkable), but \nhow cultural intermediaries work within that space of overlapping to forge occupational \nidentities, market boundaries and symbolic value. \n \nStudying Wine Promoters  \nThe article is based on qualitative interview research (Alford, 1998) with a sample of 27 \nindividuals involved in shaping and promoting the premium wine market. In terms of \ntheir primary occupational roles, 9 work as publicists or marketers\/marketing consultants; \n8 as winemakers or winemaking consultants; 5 as sommeliers, restaurateurs and\/or \nretailers; 3 as distributors\/importers; and 2 as wine writers. All are involved\u2014to greater \nand lesser degrees, with more and less intentionality\u2014in the promotion of wine, be it \nincreasing the visibility, legitimacy, market value or perceived quality of specific wines, \nwineries, or wine in general. Furthermore, the respondents all interact with small-scale \nwineries on a professional level, working (rarely exclusively) with boutique wineries or \nwines. This is significant regarding the theme of provenance, as small-scale wine brands \noften have production elements (e.g. a single vineyard or a family-owned and \u2013run \noperation) that mark them as different from the large-scale brands against which they \ncompete, and which may be more likely to yield resonant\u2014and lucrative\u2014meanings of \norigin, authenticity, and so forth.  \n \nThe research included two types of interviews, conducted in the spring of 2007 in two \nmajor Australian cities. Eight interviews (R1-8) were conducted at a trade event for \nwineries; these \u2017flash\u2018 interviews (cf. Chapman, 1999) lasted 5 to 15 minutes and \ninvolved an informal discussion about the particular wine brand. The remainder of the \nrespondents, recruited from personal contacts and snowball sampling, participated in \nsemi-standardized interviews (12 in person; 7 via the telephone), following a two-part \nquestion guide with the expectation of probing for further detail: what do you do in your \nwork to add value to wine?; as a consumer, how would you describe your wine \npreferences? Responses to the first question about work practices reflected standard \npractices for the construction of brand identities, such as designing logos, packaging and \nother promotional material, securing endorsements and high-status affiliations, and \nmanaging consumers\u2018 experiences. Responses to the second question, similarly, reflected \ncommon conventions for assessing wine quality (Charters and Pettigrew, 2006), both in \nterms of objective qualities such as a wine\u2018s typicity (especially common for high-\ninvolvement drinkers), and relative to other criteria such as price point and situation. \n \nAs much as a cultural economic framework may recognize production and consumption \nas intertwined in practice, the research design thus performed a separation, explicitly \nasking respondents to \u2017change hats\u2018 between thinking of themselves as producers or \nconsumers. This was further reflected in the thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. \nA priori templates of codes (Crabtree and Miller, 1999; King, 2004) for analysing the \ndata were derived from the literature on cultural intermediaries and their dual roles as \nsymbolic producers and connoisseur consumers; in particular, deductive coding revolved \n6 \naround the themes of adding and assessing value. These findings were then refined \nthrough an iterative process that generated data-driven inductive findings (Fereday and \nMuir-Cochrane, 2006), including the concept of provenance. The analysis thus adopts an \ninterpretive stance: wine promoters are regarded as market actors whose experiences, \nperceptions and narratives contribute to the ongoing, problematic and potentially \ncontested constitution of occupational identities and cultural categories such as \u2017the \nmarket.\u2018 The article proceeds from the premise that the market exists only as a cultural \npractice (e.g. McFall, 2004; Slater, 1993). The interviews are thus treated not as \ntransparent reflections on occupational and leisure practices, but as active moments of \nself-production and cultural-production: a narrativizing of both the self (Giddens, 1991) \nand the boundaries between production and consumption. \n \nResearch Findings \nProvenance was a broad meta-theme cutting across respondents\u2018 producing and \nconsuming narratives, incorporating such elements as origin, heritage and context of \nproduction with reference to the wine, winemaker and\/or vineyard, as well as personal \nexperience or specialized knowledge of such elements. As a general concern with \u2017where \nthings come from,\u2018 provenance is a fluid category through which respondents can be \nunderstood as symbolic producers, mediating between wines and the market, and as \nreflexive producer\/consumers, mediating between their occupational and leisure roles and \nidentities. It is along these two lines that the following discussion of findings is \nstructured. \n \nWine Promoters as Symbolic Producers  \nCultural intermediaries utilize their knowledge of, and access to, forms of legitimate \nculture in order to embed products in particular contexts and embed within them \nparticular meanings (Moor, 2008). Provenance was one strategic means (among others) \nused by wine promoters to try to mediate the context of production and the experience of \nconsumption, and thus increase a wine\u2018s marketability and market value. For example, \nthe following respondent (R3: female), responsible for sales and promotions for a New \nZealand winery run by a French winemaker, highlights the importance of the label: \nThe first year, [the winemaker] had chosen this awful label with flowers on it. I \nconvinced them to go with [our current label], which is more \u2017Old World.\u2018 \nClearly we\u2018re New World wine, but with the old label it was too much New \nWorld.  \nEchoing the winemaker\u2018s heritage, the wine\u2018s new label uses ch\u00e2teau-esque imagery, \nsignalling a difference from other New Zealand wineries, which typically feature \ntraditional\/Maori imagery. For R3, the advantage is clear: at a Singapore wine event, \n\u2017they went straight for our table, and pretty much ignored the other New Zealand wines \nthat were there, because they recognize that the name is French, and they equate that with \nquality.\u2018 Thus, the strategic use of the established credibility of French culture helps to \nsymbolically situate and augment the product. \n \nThe name of the product is also crucial in setting a wine apart from competitors. For \nexample, the following respondent (R15: male)\u2014a renowned winemaker of premium \npinot noir\u2014reflects on the importance of the name and the story it tells: \n7 \nI spent six years agonizing over the name, trying to find a name with two words \nthat sounded punchy enough and related to where I was. I looked at names of \nmountains and the quirky names like \u2017my brother\u2018s left foot\u2018, and finally came to \nthe names of two famous explorers in the region. And the name was an immediate \nsuccess. It wasn\u2018t long after launching that people were using the name, asking \nfor it. \nThe responses from R3 and R15 highlight the obstacles (and opportunities) faced by New \nWorld wines, which may lack an established reputation (for the winemaker, region, or \nboth). One solution to this dilemma\u2014the \u2017quirky name\u2018\u2014explicitly rejects tradition, \nsignalling a wine\u2018s style not in terms of variety or region but lifestyle. For the majority of \nthe respondents in this research, however, product stories tended to be provenance \nstories: origin myths that embed the product in a particular context of creation by \nselectively framing aspects of its production, such as the winemaker\u2018s biography or the \nhistory of the region. As a narrative construct, provenance stories have a considerably \nlooser relationship than terroir with the actual conditions of production. For example, a \npopular Australian brand\u2018s strapline, \u2017Welcome to our place,\u2018 evokes a local identity for a \nproduct that is, in fact, made from grapes sourced from across South Australia: a \nsymbolic re-territorialization of a diffuse production system (cf. Lury, 2004: 54). \nAnathema to terroir purists, such narratives of provenance nevertheless resonate with the \nbroader use of heritage as a source of value for cultural products. \n \nConstructions of provenance are used to manage the impressions and experiences of \nconsumers, be it through labels, displays, reviews or\u2014most immediately\u2014the \nperformative labour of a wine promoter. For example, the following respondent (R9: \nmale), now owner of a wine management company, reflects on his strategy of employing \nsommeliers as retailers when he previously managed the boutique wine shop of a luxury \nhotel:  \nSommeliers are passionate about what they\u2018re doing. And that\u2018s fantastic. And \nthat ultimately drives the consumer. The consumer knows, \u2017I\u2018m getting something \nright to drink. And I\u2018ve got the story behind it.\u2018 So when I set up the wine shop, I \nwanted the shop run by sommeliers, because a sommelier will get intimately \ninvolved in what they are serving. And they will show and tell the story. And at \nthe end of the day, you as a consumer will pick up that bottle and you will go \nhome and you will tell the story to your friends. \u2017Do you know that the guy who \nmade this wine\u2026\u2018 \nConstructions of provenance occur at a variety of levels of immediacy, from standardized \nlabels to interpersonal performances. As such, many of the respondents (particularly \nmarketers and distributors who mediate between winemakers and retailers) provided \neducational services, training staff so \u2017that the wine becomes alive\u2018 (R14: male; \ndistributor), and thereby enabling other actors in the circuit of culture to serve as \nperformers of provenance.  \n \nSimilarly, the following respondent (R26: male), the global marketing director for a \nnational wine industry organization, highlights the importance of narrative for \nlegitimating the product:  \n8 \nWhen you have a lot of small producers, and when you\u2018re selling at that premium \nor super-premium end of the market, then it\u2018s all about the stories. It\u2018s all about \nknowing something about the wine. \u2017This is from a tiny winery, overlooking the \nsea.\u2018 It\u2018s about the personal stories. And it\u2018s those stories that sell the 6 to 8 pound \nbottles of wine. For the \u00a33.90 bottle of wine, for the 3 for 2 offers on the \nAustralian wine: it\u2018s cheap and it\u2018s boring. But for the 6 pound bottle, you can \nsay, \u2017I was at this wine fair, and I met this great winemaker\u2026\u2018 \nAs for nearly all the respondents, R9 and R26 position the \u2017average\u2018 consumer as less \nknowledgeable, and reliant on the wine promoter to establish particular wines as \u2017worthy \nchoices\u2018 (Johnston and Baumann, 2007: 170). Provenance stories not only set wines apart \nfrom each other, but also offer consumers cultural capital (the story) as added-value. \nHence, the importance of the cultural intermediary: the product is enhanced by the \nprovenance story, but the perceived sincerity (Beverland, 2005)\u2014and value\u2014of that \nstory rests on the cultural authority of the wine promoter. Wine promoters accomplish the \n\u2017production of the value of the work or, what amounts to the same thing, of the belief in \nthe value of the work\u2018 (Bourdieu, 1996: 229).  \n \nWine promoters make cultural and economic calculations\u2014what is included, what is left \nout\u2014in the types of stories they tell and the selective transparency (Lury, 2004: 161) they \noffer: a partial view of some aspects of the conditions of production (the vineyard\u2018s \ncharms, the winemaker\u2018s quixotic dreams) that disguises or ignores other aspects (the \nday-to-day financial realities of making wine). Wines are thereby embedded in a \nparticularized, personalized and fictional context of production, increasing consumers\u2018 \ntrust in, and willingness to pay a premium for, the product (Sassatelli and Scott, 2001). \nAs \u2017invented traditions\u2018 (Hobsbawm and Ranger, 1983), provenance stories mediate \nbetween the actual material production of a wine and its reception in the marketplace (cf. \nJack and Phipps, 2005: 55).  \n \nBy contextualizing the product (cf. Johnston and Baumann, 2007: 178), wine promoters \nprovide consumers with a personal stake in a wine\u2018s \u2017back story,\u2018 and a potential entr\u00e9e \nto an experience of communitas (the romanticized conviviality of winemaking) or \nmembership (the rarefied cadre of wine insiders). This pedagogical aspect of wine \npromotion, however, has the awkward consequence of demystifying the object on which \nclaims to professional authority rest. Or, as Wright (2005: 111) observes of cultural \nintermediaries in the book trade: \u2017They are torn between winning a market for cultural \ngoods, which entails popularization, and preserving the rarity and difference that is the \nessence of their social position and power.\u2018 For wine promoters, as for cultural \nintermediaries more broadly, it is a matter of livelihood to insist that there is a gap \nbetween production and consumption, between themselves and the average consumer\u2014a \ngap they are uniquely able to bridge (Cronin, 2004; Entwistle, 2006). The study of wine \npromoters thus contributes a nuanced view of the \u2017enduring distance\u2018 between production \nand consumption (Negus, 2002). The contemporary era of the prosumer is not about \nfinally overcoming this distance in order to seamlessly incorporate the consumer, but \nabout selectively mediating the distance, giving access to some but not all of the \u2017inside \nview\u2018 of provenance in order to indirectly manage the consumer\u2018s experience of \nconnectedness with the product. As a mechanism for embedding products, the \n9 \nprovenance story is itself a liminal product, the outcome of wine promoters\u2018 reflexive \nidentities as producer\/consumers. \n \nWine Promoters as Reflexive Producer\/Consumers \nCultural intermediaries \u2017always sell themselves as models and as guarantors of the value \nof their products\u2018 (Bourdieu, 1984: 365). The implication for wine promoters is that the \nconsumption of wine is not only a matter of personal interest and preference, but also, \nunlike for other wine drinkers, a matter of livelihood. The relationship between \noccupational practices and consuming preferences can take various forms, including \ndrinking in order to know the market and \u2017benchmark your product\u2018 (R18: female; \npublicist), and mobilizing personal consuming choices as emblems of professional \ncredibility. In both respects, wine promoters are exemplars of the reflexive \nproducer\/consumer, who employs a capacity to reflect and draw on occupational and \nleisure experiences in order to inform future practices. In short: they rely on the personal \nto accomplish the professional (Smith Maguire, 2008). With regard to provenance, such \nreflexivity tends to revolve around particular stocks of cultural and social capital. \n \nFor example, asked to describe his consuming preferences, the global marketing director \nfor a national wine industry organization (R26) explains his personal taste with reference \nto knowledge: \nPeople in the wine industry love pinot noir, because it\u2018s the toughest grape to \ngrow. It\u2018s the toughest to blend. It\u2018s got thin skins, it\u2018s a fickle grape, and it needs \na lot of love and attention and you can taste that in the glass. Pinot noir is the holy \ngrail for winemakers. And for white wine, it\u2018s probably riesling. Riesling shows \nits place, and it requires a lot of winemaking skills. You know, [some] \nwinemakers will get sniffy about sauvignon blanc, they\u2018ll say it\u2018s too easy. You \njust grow it and squeeze it.   \nBourdieu\u2018s (1984) work suggests that taste is less a matter of the preferred object per se \nthan the reason behind the preference. Broadly speaking, he identifies a class-based \npattern in tastes for the popular and functional (for the working class), or the esoteric and \nluxurious (for the bourgeoisie). A preference for an esoteric wine may thus shift if the \nwine becomes popular or \u2017too easy\u2018\u2014as when sauvignon blanc replaces chardonnay as \nthe top-selling wine (Port, 2009). If taste is an expression of cultural capital, and social \nstatus is established through differentials in forms of capital, then the proselytizing \naspects of wine promotion raise unintended consequences: converting others to the object \nof your taste diminishes the exclusivity of that wine, stimulating the search for new \nvarietals (such as riesling) that can signal the difference between the wine promoter and \nthe \u2017average\u2018 consumer.  \n \nKey to establishing distance from the average consumer\u2014a distinction on which \noccupational status and professional credibility rest\u2014is the wine promoter\u2018s stock of \ncultural capital (e.g. specialized oenological knowledge and the embodied capital of \npalate) and social capital (e.g. personal relationships with winemakers and other wine \npromoters). These resources are explicitly put into practice\u2014and on display\u2014through \npersonal consumption choices. Therein lies the utility of provenance goods as positional \ngoods. In the contemporary status economy, as access to formerly exclusive cultural \n10 \nknowledge has widened, the possession of such knowledge is not enough. Status now \nrequires the active and conspicuous display of knowledge (Skeggs, 2001: 148): not just \nchoosing the riesling over the sauvignon blanc, but also performing its story.  \n \nWine promoters\u2018 reflexivity as producer\/consumers hinges on the source and deployment \nof capital. Their stock of knowledge about wine is drawn from both leisure and work \nexperiences (indeed, many attributed their broad range of experiences to both personal \ninterest and the nature of their work, through which they have had access to wines \notherwise beyond their reach); and that knowledge is used to both assess their options as \nwine consumers, and legitimate their authority as wine promoters. For example, consider \nthe following comment from the wine management company owner (R9: male) \ncomparing two wines of the same grape variety:  \nI bought Hill of Grace, which I still probably consider today a better wine than \nGrange, and I consider it so because Hill of Grace comes from the vineyard Hill of \nGrace, in Eden Valley, in the Barossa Range, in Barossa. It\u2018s made by a couple, \nStephen and Prue Henschke, and it is what you get.  \nClassifying Hill of Grace (small-scale) as better than Penfolds Grange (global luxury \nwine brand), R9 simultaneously classifies himself as a credible intermediary, whose \npalate and knowledge of provenance mean that he is not swayed by brand reputation. The \nprecondition of wine promoters\u2018 social and occupational position is the ability to adopt a \ntactical position relative to branding and promotional strategies. Like R9, several \nrespondents criticized the market value of Grange as a product of \u2017hype.\u2018 Similarly, in \ndiscussions of blind tasting (where the promotional context is removed and tasters are \nreliant solely on palate), respondents often noted with pride that their preferences were \nnot necessarily the wines with the most awards or highest prices. Wine promoters\u2018 \nconsuming practices must convincingly demonstrate their \u2017good\u2018 taste for some forms of \nprovenance over others, thereby creating a critical distance between themselves and the \nmarket. \n \nA preference for small-scale wineries was common across respondents, and their \ncomments echoed existing research on the association of authenticity with the hand-\ncrafted, local, non-commercial, natural and traditional as opposed to the mass-produced \nand industrialized (e.g. Johnston and Baumann, 2007; Sassatelli and Scott, 2001; Zukin, \nforthcoming). The issue of provenance, here, brings into focus the tension between the \nlarge- and small-scale, the industrialized and artisanal, the inauthentic and authentic. \nNeither static nor inherent, such terms are discursively accomplished through the ongoing \nexercise of dispositions and practices. For example, consider how R17 (female), who \norganizes wine events as part of her work as public relations director of a luxury hotel, \ndescribes her preference for small-scale wines: \nIt\u2018s like anything: if you wear a dress which was designed by someone that you \nmet you feel closer to it; if you buy a painting from an artist that you\u2018ve met, or \nyou have your house decorated by someone that you\u2018ve met\u2026 I think that people \njust like to have connections with the people with whom they do transactions. \n\u2026People really want to feel that they have a connection, so they have wine in the \nfridge that they can pull out and say to friends, \u2017Oh I met the winemaker and he \n11 \nwas delightful,\u2018 or, you know, \u2017He was an irascible character,\u2018 or whatever it may \nbe. \nSimilarly, the owner of an upscale restaurant with an extensive Old World wine list (R20: \nmale) explains his preferences with reference to heritage\u2014his own and that of \nwinemaking generally:  \nI think the New World are like green winemakers, and the Old World are brown \nwinemakers. I\u2018m using that as a metaphor, green meaning clean, technical, \nstainless steel, very structured; brown meaning chickens running around the \nvineyards, sort of rustic. What has happened with the green style winemaking, \nwe\u2018ve become so green, that our wines in Australia are suffering this \nhomogenized effect. In my perspective and having an Italian background, it\u2018s \nsimple: food, wine, and earnest conversation. \u2026 So, [the Old World] is incredibly \nromantic to me. \u2026 It\u2018s age-old, and it\u2018s been there forever, so there\u2018s this \nbeautiful romanticism.  \nLike R17 and R20, many of the wine promoters espoused the belief that (some) wine still \nholds the possibility of an authentic experience, unmediated by advertising, labels and the \nlike\u2014what Turner (1995) might describe as communitas. The roots of this romantic \nnotion of wine lie in its long history as a social drink, the uses of which cross temporal, \ncultural and class boundaries (Charters, 2006), and in its agricultural context, which is \nmore pronounced for small-scale producers, and especially those employing biodynamic \nprinciples where the rationality, calculability and predictability (Ritzer, 1996) of large-\nscale mass producers is absent, or at least severely curtailed by the changing patterns of \nclimate. \n \nResearch on fields such as advertising (Soar, 2000) and branding consultancy (Moor, \n2008) suggests that cultural intermediaries use themselves as proxies for their intended \nconsumer market. For R17 and R20\u2014as for the wine promoters generally\u2014their status as \nreflexive producer\/consumers implies that these personal preferences (for the small-scale, \nhand-crafted and that which is perceived as authentic) impact on the choices they make \nfor which wines to bring to market (through selection for a wine event, wine list and so \nforth), and the strategies they adopt to affiliate those wines with the perceived aspirations \nand desires of the target market. Tangible, firsthand experiences of provenance, however, \nremain largely the preserve of the few, who can then trade on such forms of cultural and \nsocial capital. By translating personal experience into provenance stories, wine promoters \nserve as liminal conduits for a strategically constructed, mediated form of communitas, \nfrom which economic value (occupational success for the wine promoter; market value \nfor the wine) can be extracted (cf. Arvidsson, 2005).  \n \nConclusion \nWine promoters operate in the liminal space between production and consumption. \nDrawing on personal dispositions and experiences, they construct added-value through \ncontextualizing devices and narratives. At the same time, wine promoters in their \nconsuming narratives located the value of wine outside of economic parameters, as \nsomething authentic and convivial, exempt from the manipulations of the market\u2014\nincluding those to which they had actively contributed. The wine promoters\u2018 ambivalent \nrelationship with the market is thus captured in the concept of provenance: it may be \n12 \nunderstood as both a strategic device for adding value, which aligns them with an \neconomic agenda; and as a tactical device for assessing value, which distances them from \nthe average consumer and aligns them with a small-scale, \u2017authentic\u2018 and less \ncommercial culture of production (cf. de Certeau, 1984). In their narratives, wine \npromoters thus place these realms in dialogue while insisting on their separation, thereby \nimplicating them in the ongoing reproduction of the categories of, and the distance \nbetween, production and consumption.  \n \nSince the mid 20\nth\n century, marketing has increasingly concerned itself with how best to \novercome this distance between production and consumption, by affiliating product \nqualities and brand values with consumers\u2018 perceived desires and anxieties. In this way, \nmarketing has developed as a governmental technology directed at \u2017mobilizing\u2018 (Miller \nand Rose, 1997; see also Zwick et al., 2008) consumers to enact their freedom within the \nmarketplace in appropriate ways, and thereby (ideally) accomplishing a seamless flow \nbetween supply and demand. However, consumer markets have continued to fragment \nand tastes to change, meaning that the gap between producers and consumers remains as \n\u2017one of the most vexing barriers toward increasing control over markets\u2018 (Zwick et al., \n2008: 182). Recent discussions of value co-creation through drawing the consumer (or \nprosumer) into the production process (e.g. Arvidsson, 2005; Prahalad and Ramaswamy, \n2000; Tapscott and Williams, 2007) are examples of attempts to overcome this barrier. \nHowever, these \u2017solutions\u2018 do not remove the distance between production and \nconsumption; rather, they reassert and mediate the distance in strategic ways. The figure \nof the prosumers implies\u2014and requires\u2014that of the reflexive producer\/consumer: the \nmarket actor who draws on his or her own subjective preferences and experiences to \nproduce an empathetic assessment, and effective management, of the interests and \ningenuity of others.  \n \nStepping back from the specific case of wine promoters, the study of cultural \nintermediaries thus offers to marketing theory, more broadly, a crucial\u2014but not, as yet, \nfully explored\u2014perspective on the subjective dynamics of markets: how the affective \ncapacities and cultural capital of service workers serves as the basis for value creation, \nvia the engineering of affective opportunities and paths for consumers (and prosumers). \nThe governmental mobilization of consumers\u2018 freedom and economic exploitation of \nprosumers\u2018 creative labour and emotional attachment require a cadre of intermediaries \nwho finesse those linkages between the realms of production and consumption. This \nunderlines the importance of problematizing market(ing) practitioners. Further research \non such occupations is necessary to grasp how various actors attempt to channel \nconsumers\u2018 freedom along prescribed routes by affiliating their perceived fears and \naspirations with particular product qualities. Who better to do such work than those \nwhose liminal status affords them a view of both sides of the equation?  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to those editors and reviewers who offered constructive suggestions on an earlier \ndraft. \n \n \n13 \nReferences \nAguirre, M.
