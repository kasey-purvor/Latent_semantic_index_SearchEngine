To write about the ecclesiology of St \nMaximos the Confessor, therefore, is to attempt to draw out from his multitudinous \nwritings something that he only discusses in connexion with other matters, or quite \nallusively.1  This is a potentially formidable task, as Maximos\u2019 theological method is \nessentially allusive, and traces relevant to a consideration of his understanding of the \nChurch could be found in very many places.  For the purposes of this paper, I shall \nconcentrate mainly on three places where the question of the nature of the Church seems \nmore directly to be raised: first, his commentary on the Divine Liturgy, the Mystagogia,2 \nsecondly, fragments from a couple of letters\u2014one preserved only in the Latin translation \nof Anastasius the Librarian\u2014generally referred to as Opuscula theologica et polemica 11 and \n12 which bear more on the institutional nature of the Church,3 and finally the discussions \nof the nature and authority of the Church to be found in the dossier of documents \nconnected with his trial and condemnation for opposing the imperial will over \nChristology.4 \nIt might be useful, first of all, to sketch the circumstances of Maximos\u2019 life.  Born in 580, \nhe was most likely brought up in Constantinople, though little is known for certain about \nhis early years.  On the accession of the Emperor Herakleios in 610, he seems to have \nbeen appointed protoasecretis, that is, head of the imperial chancellery, but after a very few \nyears, he left the imperial service and became a monk, initially just over the Bosphoros \nfrom Constantinople and a little later in a monastery at Kyzikos, at the foot of what is \nnow the Erdek peninsula on the Asia coast of the Bay of Marmara.  In 626, the Persian \narmy occupied the Asian coast opposite Constantinople, and Maximos, with many other \nmonks, fled, finally reaching North Africa about 630, where he joined a monastery of \n\u00e9migr\u00e9 monks, probably under the leadership of Sophronios, who later, as Patriarch of \nJerusalem, surrendered the Holy City to the Arabs.  Many of Maximos\u2019 earlier works, \nincluding the Mystagogia, belong to his first years in Africa.  From 633 onwards Maximos \ngradually came to be drawn into the Christological controversy that, on the one hand, \nculminated in the Lateran Synod of 649 and the Sixth \u0152cumenical Synod held at \nConstantinople in 680-1 and, on the other, in his own arrest for incurring the displeasure \nof the Emperor, trials, condemnation and death in exile in 662.   \nThe Mystagogia could be regarded as being explicitly a work on the nature of the Church, \nfor the commentary on the Divine Liturgy is set in the context of reflections by Maximos \non the various images of the Church, both as a community and as a building.  In these \ninitial chapters, which are recapitulated at the end of the treatise after the exposition of \nthe events of the Liturgy, Maximos presents an understanding of the Church as the \ncentral element in a series of ways of understanding the relationship of God to the \ncosmos and to human kind.  He begins by discussing in chapter 1 how the Church may \nbe seen as \u2018an image and type of God\u2019 by imitating and representing God\u2019s activity \n(energeia).  God has brought everything into being, \u2018contains, gathers and limits them and \nin his providence binds both intelligible and sensible beings to himself and one another\u2019. \nIt is in the this way that the holy Church of God will be shown to be active among \nus in the same way as God, as an image reflects its archetype.  For many and of \nnearly boundless number are the men, women and children who are distinct from \none another and vastly different by birth and appearance, by race and language, by \nway of life and age, by opinions and skills, by manners and customs, by pursuits \nand studies, and still again by reputation, fortune, characteristics and habits: all are \nborn into the Church and through it are reborn and recreated in the Spirit.  To all \nin equal measures it gives and bestows one divine form and designation, to be \nChrist\u2019s and to carry his name.  In accordance with faith it gives to all a single, \nsimple, whole and indivisible condition which does not allow us to bring to mind \nthe existence of the myriads of differences among them, even if they do exist, \nthrough the universal relationship and union of all things with it.  It is through it \nthat absolutely no one at all is in himself separated from the community since \neveryone converges with all the rest and joins together with them by the one, \nsimple, and indivisible grace and power of faith.  \u2018For all,\u2019 it is said, \u2018had but one \nheart and one mind.\u2019  Thus to be and to appear as one body formed of different \nmembers is really worthy of Christ himself, our true head, in whom says the divine \nApostle, \u2018there is neither male nor female, neither Jew nor Greek, neither \ncircumcision nor uncircumcision, neither barbarian nor Scythian, neither slave nor \nfree, but he is all and in all.\u2019  It is he who encloses in himself all beings by the \nunique, simple and infinitely wise power of his goodness. \nMaximos goes on to apply the analogy of the radii of a circle converging on the centre to \nboth God\u2019s relationship to the created order and the Church\u2019s relationship to its \nmembers, and concludes that, in both cases, there is achieved a union that, though \nprofound, does not confuse the beings joined, but preserves their integrity. \nMaximos goes on in the succeeding chapters to show how the union of differences \nfound in the Church is also reflected throughout the created order.  To begin with, in \nchapter 2, he suggests that the Church may be seen as an image of the cosmos, regarded \nas made up of visible and invisible beings.  It is from this point on that he thinks of the \nchurch as a building, and more precisely as a building divided into two: the area for \u2018the \npriests and ministers alone\u2019, that is, the sanctuary (in Greek: hierateion), and the area for \nthe \u2018all the faithful people\u2019, which is called the nave (naon).5  This distinction he finds \nechoed in the cosmos, in the distinction there between the invisible part of the cosmos \nand the visible part.  These two parts are closely related; indeed, Maximos says, the \nchurch is not properly speaking divided by the differences between the two parts, but \nrather by the relationship between the two parts, so that, \u2018the nave is potentially the \nsanctuary since it is a holy place by reason of its relationship to the goal of sacred \ninitiation (or: mystagogy), and the sanctuary is actually the nave, since it is there that the \nprocess of its own sacred initiation begins\u2019.  So, too, with the cosmos: \u2018for the whole \nintelligible cosmos is imprinted in a hidden way on the whole sensible cosmos through \nthe symbolic forms, while the whole sensible cosmos can be understood to be present to \nthe intelligible cosmos through its principles (logoi) that reveal its simplicity to the \nintellect\u2019.  The distinction found in cosmos and Church that is the reason for one being \nan image of the other is matter of relationship rather than separation; it is a matter of \nconnexion, and not division, and it is an ordered connexion, the visible pointing to the \ninvisible realm, so that the visible finds its meaning in the invisible, and the invisible finds \nits expression in the visible, and in this way reflecting the close relationship between \nsanctuary and nave in the church. \nThe following chapters suggest further images of the church: in the visible world itself, \nconsisting as it does of heaven and earth (chapter 3), and then in the human person, \nconsisting of body and soul (chapter 4), and the soul, consisting of soul and intellect \n(chapter 5).  Chapters 4 and 5 develop a fairly detailed understanding of the spiritual life, \nmoving from the level of body, which is the level of ascetic struggle, in which we learn \nmoral wisdom, to the level of soul, which is the level of natural contemplation, that is \ncontemplation of the principles (logoi) of the cosmos, which are all summed up in the \nLogos himself, Christ, and finally to the level of intellect, the level of mystical theology, \nthat is contemplation of God himself (Maximos, while still using the image of the \ntwofold church to interpret the passage from one level to another, also combines them in \na threefold image of the church with nave, sanctuary and altar, thusiasterion).  Chapter 6 \nintroduces a further image of the Church: \njust as, in accordance with contemplation that brings about ascent, he [the \u2018old \nman\u2019, or geronta, to whom Maximos attributes his Mystagogia] called the Church a \nspiritual human being and human kind a mystical Church, so he said that the whole \nof holy Scripture is, in short, a human being, the Old Testament having the body, \nand the New Testament soul and spirit and intellect, or again, taking the whole of \nholy Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, its body is the historical letter, while \nthe meaning of what is written and its purpose, towards which the intellect strives, \nis the soul. \nThe purpose of all these interlinking images seems to be manifold.  It means that \nanything that takes place in one context has its counterpart in another, so that the \nmeaning of everything that takes place in any of these contexts both borrows from and \ncontributes to the others.  There are then profound interconnexions between Church, \ncosmos (understood both as embracing the spiritual and material realm and as embracing \nthe visible heavens and the earth), the inward life of the human person, and even the \nScriptures themselves.  Spelling this out in terms of ecclesiology, this means that the \nsignificance of the Church has cosmic dimensions, but also that its significance reaches \ninto the heart of each individual Christian and his or her own pilgrimage towards union \nwith God; it also means that the Church, like Scripture, is a place where God has made \nhimself known, and this being made known is not just, or even, a matter of information, \nbut rather a matter of participation in God himself through his activities or energies.  \nThis has implications both for the nature of the Church as a community, and for the \nChurch\u2019s liturgical activity, in which the Church is made manifest at its deepest and \nclearest.  It is this latter that Maximos pursues in the Mystagogia, but a word might be said \nfirst about the former. \nIt is evident from the way Maximos develops his understanding of the way in which the \nChurch is reflected as an image of God, cosmos, the human, the soul, and the Bible, that \nMaximos conceives of the Church as a community that, on the one hand, is a place \nwhere diversity contributes to a deep and rich unity.  It is in this drawing everything \ntogether into unity that the Church manifests itself as an image of God, a God who \ncreates beings in their extraordinary variety, but draws them together into a wonderful \nharmony.  Within this unity, everything\u2014everyone\u2014counts, but this happens without \neverything being reduced to the same level.  For, on the other hand, Maximos\u2019 vision of \nthe Church is profoundly hierarchical.  That word, \u2018hierarchy\u2019, has been corrupted for us, \nand now carries almost inevitable overtones of suppression and subordination, but for \nMaximos it was a word, newly coined by the Christian known as \u2018Dionysios the \nAreopagite\u2019, who flourished at the beginning of the century\u2014the sixth\u2014in which \nMaximos was born.  For Maximos, the etymological overtones of the word\u2014a \ncompound of \u2018sacred\u2019 and \u2018source\u2019 or \u2018beginning\u2019\u2014would presumably have registered, \nbut even more significant would have been the definition given this word by the one who \nhad invented it, Dionysios himself, who said, \u2018by hierarchy I mean a sacred order ad \nknowledge and activity that is being assimilated, as far as is possible, to the Godlike, and \nbeing raised up analogously by the illuminations given it from God to imitation of God\u2019.6  \nHierarchy does mean order but, like the structure of the church building as Maximos \nexplains it, it is an order drawing and being drawn up to union with God, and more than \nthat it is a matter of knowledge and activity.  It is in this sense that the Church, for \nMaximos, is hierarchical; there is order and structure, manifest not least in the ranks of \nthe ministers, that enables the church as a community to be ordered towards God, to be \nan instrument of God\u2019s outreach towards those that do not know him or misunderstand \nhim, to be a place where God\u2019s activity is encountered and knowledge of God is shared. \nIt is, however, the liturgical activities of the Church, pre-eminently in the Divine Liturgy \nof the Eucharist, that capture Maximos\u2019 attention in the Mystagogia.  Chapters 8 to 21 are \ndevoted to explaining the meaning of the various ceremonies of the Divine Liturgy.  \nThese begin with the entrance of the bishop into the Church, accompanied by the people \n(in Maximos\u2019 day, the Sunday liturgy was evidently still preceded by a procession to the \nchurch).  The entry of the bishop into the church symbolizes Christ\u2019s first coming into \nthe world in the Incarnation; the entry of the people symbolizes conversion\u2014from \nunbelief to faith, from vice and ignorance to virtue and knowledge.  In the readings, we \nencounter God\u2019s desires and intentions for us; the singing symbolizes the joy of our \nturning towards God; the bishop\u2019s acclamations of peace before the readings (\u2018Peace to \nall\u2014And to your spirit\u2019) symbolize the help of the angels in our struggle to live a godlike \nlife.  Then Maximos comes to the Gospel\u2014and everything that follows it, for chapter 13 \ndiscusses not just the meaning of the reading of the Gospel, but continues with a brief \naccount of everything that follows it, even though he is going to discuss these one by one \nin the next eight chapters.  The gospel reading itself \u2018proposes to those who are zealous \nsome suffering on behalf of the Word\u2019; a true hearing of the Gospel always entails the \nbearing of the Cross in some practical way\u2014as St Maximos\u2019 own life exemplifies.  The \npurpose of this suffering is to detach us from worldly matters and draw us more closely \nto participation in the secret wisdom of God.  All of this is brought out in the \nceremonies that follow the Gospel reading: the closing of the doors, the exchange of the \nkiss of peace, the recitation of the creed of faith, the singing of the thrice-holy (the \nsanctus),7 together with the holy angels, the uttering with our lips the words of the Our \nFather in which we lay claim to communion with God, and then, beyond that, the chant \nOne is holy, leading beyond knowledge to the unknowable unity, \u2018now that we are deified \nby grace, and assimilated to him by participation in an indivisible identity, so far as this is \npossible\u2019.  After the Gospel, the bishop descends from his throne, and dismisses the \ncatechumens; this symbolizes the Second Coming of Christ and the final judgment.  \nEverything that follows\u2014the whole of the liturgy of the faithful\u2014is then understood by \nMaximos to take place after the Second Coming.  The closing of the doors means our \npassing, after the judgment, into the nuptial chamber of Christ, the entrance into the \nmysteries our entrance into the final revelation of the divine wisdom.  The meaning of \nthe kiss of peace, the recitation of the creed, the singing of the sanctus, the saying of the \nOur Father, the singing of the One is Holy, and communion itself in the divine gifts: all this \nMaximos has already explained, and his further explanations all underline their \neschatological significance, with the coming together of heaven and earth, and the \ndeification of the human as the fulfilment of the Incarnation of the Divine. \nThe proclamation of the Gospel is then, for Maximos, indeed the \u2018end of history\u2019; to hear \nthe Gospel is truly to pass beyond the eschaton.  Maximos\u2019 understanding of the \ncelebration of the Divine Liturgy is thoroughly eschatological; the ceremonies after the \nreading of the Gospel all take place in the age to come.  Maximos does not mention the \neucharistic anaphora; by this time it was probably said silently, and perhaps Maximos \nonly commented on what a layman, such as he seems to have been, would have heard\u2014\nbut the way in which the events remembered in the anamnesis in the Byzantine rite include \nthe \u2018glorious and dread Second Coming\u2019 would have seemed not at all puzzling to him.  \nThe way in which the early Church celebrated the Eucharist on the brink of the age to \ncome (cf. the fragments of the eucharistic anaphora of the Didache) is fully preserved in \nMaximos\u2019 understanding of the Divine Liturgy.  Alain Riou sees a deeper significance in \nMaximos\u2019 omission of any mention of the eucharistic anaphora, which is worth \nmentioning here: \u2018The true anaphora (the configuring anamnesis and the eschatological \nepiclesis) of Christ is only consummated in the martyr himself: in that apophatic anaphora, \nthe Christian and the Church receive in communion and consummate in silence their \ntransparency to the paschal mystery\u2019.8  Riou\u2019s words remind one of the eucharistic \nechoes of St Polycarp\u2019s prayer as the fires were lit; they also remind us that Maximos\u2019 \nwords are the words of one who was to confess the faith to the point of death. \nMaximos\u2019 eucharistic ecclesiology is an eschatological ecclesiology.  The full significance \nof the words quoted earlier from the first chapter of the Mystagogia, in which the Church \nwas defined as an image of God, now become apparent: \u2018all are born into the Church \nand through it are reborn and recreated in the Spirit.  To all in equal measures it gives \nand bestows one divine form and designation, to be Christ\u2019s and to carry his name.  In \naccordance with faith it gives to all a single, simple, whole and indivisible condition\u2026\u2019\u2014\nwhich is ultimately that of the martyr, the witness for Christ, the witness to the truth \nabout Christ.  And this eschatological ecclesiology has ramifications, through the multiple \nimages that the Church bears, for the cosmos, for the inner life of the soul, even for our \nunderstanding of Holy Scripture.  We can see something of what this means in a series of \nchapters from the Second Century on Theology and the Incarnate Dispensation.9  This group of \nchapters (51-70) form a series of meditations on the sixth, seventh and eighth days; Riou \nsuggests, rightly, that they are a meditation on the Triduum\u2014Good Friday, Holy \nSaturday, and Easter Sunday.  They provide a paschal interpretation of the Christian life, \nthe three stages of which\u2014ascetic struggle, natural contemplation, and mystical theology \nor deification\u2014correspond to the three days (cf. Cent. I.55).  This rooting of the stages of \nthe Christian life in the paschal mystery brings to light what one might call the ecclesial \ndimension of asceticism.  The cosmic dimension is manifest in the way the transitus \nthrough these days leads to, and beyond, knowledge of created things (ibid. 66).  The \ndifferent chapters illumine different aspects of this mystery, but characteristic is the sixty-\nseventh, which reads: \nAll visible realities need the cross, that is, the state in which they are cut off from \nthings acting upon them through the senses.  All intelligible realities need burial, \nthat is, the total quiescence of the things which act upon them through the intellect.  \nWhen all relationship with such things is severed, and their natural activity and \nstimulus is cut off, then the Logos, who exists alone in himself, appears as if risen \nfrom the dead.  He encompasses all that comes from him, but nothing enjoys \nkinship with him by virtue of natural relationship.  For the salvation of the saved is \nby grace and not by nature. \nThis vision of the Church entering into the Paschal mystery highlights its eschatological \nnature, something also manifest in the way in which the Church is conceived of as \ncoming into being through the power of the Spirit.  This understanding of the Church\u2014\ncosmic, eschatological, eucharistic, epicletic\u2014gathers together the central themes of \nMaximos\u2019 theology. \nFor Maximos, however, the Church is not just a vision, it is a reality in which the \neschatological breaks into history, and that reality takes a specific historical form, even \none might say, a political form.  So we turn to look at those texts in which Maximos \nexpresses his ideas on the presence of the Church and its structures in the political realm.  \nThe texts we shall be concerned with from now on belong to a much later period in \nMaximos\u2019 life than the Mystagogia.  The 630s constituted a watershed, not only in \nMaximos\u2019 life, but also in the history of Mediterranean civilization within the bosom of \nwhich Christianity and the Christian Church were born and developed.  In that decade, \nthere emerged on the stage of world history a new religion, Islam, which in the course of \nthat decade established itself firmly in the Middle East, and by the middle of the next \ndecade had destroyed the Persian Empire and robbed the Byzantine or Roman Empire \nof its eastern provinces, including Egypt, for good.  All this was to have profound \nrepercussions, still palpable today.  But in Maximos\u2019 immediate circles, it provoked in the \nByzantine Empire an attempt to heal the divisions in the Church, caused by the Synod of \nChalcedon of 451, that had been exploited by the Arabs (and before them by the \nPersians).  This attempt at what might be regarded in current language as premature \necumenism\u2014a Christological compromise, intended to bridge the divide between those \nwho accepted Chalcedon and those who rejected it\u2014was called monothelitism (which \nwas presaged by another compromise called monenergism).  Monothelitism saw itself as \nrefining the position reached at Chalcedon, that Christ was a single divine person uniting \nin himself a divine and human nature, by clarifying that he had only one will, a divine \none.  For Maximos, this position was fundamentally unacceptable, for it meant that, \nlacking a human will, Christ\u2019s humanity was imperfect.  Maximos was not alone in his \nopposition to monothelitism; indeed, the controversy was such that, in the so-called \nTypos of 648, the Emperor tried to put an end to controversy by forbidding any \ndiscussion at all of the number of wills in Christ.  This was not acceptable to Maximos \neither, for he was convinced that monothelitism was wrong and heretical.  Most of the \neastern Church, at least that part still under imperial authority, acquiesced in the \nEmperor\u2019s will, and Maximos sought support in the West.  In 649 a synod was held at St \nJohn Lateran, called and presided over by Pope Martin I, that condemned monothelitism \nand the hierarchs who had supported it (including a pope, Honorius I).  The emperor \nwas furious at such insurgency and quickly had Pope Martin arrested, and later on \nMaximos, too, whom he rightly suspected of being behind the Lateran synod.  Martin \nwas tried for sedition and exiled to the Crimea, where he died in 655; Maximos was tried \nfor heresy, and after having his right hand and tongue cut off, was finally exiled to \nLazica, in Georgia, where he died in 662.  Both came to be regarded as martyrs for the \nOrthodox faith. \nOur next texts are two fragments of letters that constitute opuscula 11 and 12.  Both of \nthese speak in glowing terms of the central importance of the church of Rome.  The first \nfragment, written shortly after the Lateran Synod, asserts \nAll the ends of the inhabited world, and those who anywhere on earth confess the \nLord with a pure and orthodox faith, look directly to the most holy Church of the \nRomans and her confession and faith as to a sun of eternal light, receiving from her \nthe radiant beam of the patristic and holy doctrines, just as the holy six synods,10 \ninspired and sacred, purely and with all devotion set them forth, uttering most \nclearly the symbol of faith.  For, from the time of the descent to us of the incarnate \nWord of God, all the Churches of the Christians everywhere have held and possess \nthis most great Church as the sole base and foundation, since, according to the very \npromise of the Saviour, it will never be overpowered by the gates of hell, but rather \nhas the keys of the orthodox faith and confession in him, and to those who \napproach it with reverence it opens the genuine and unique piety, but shuts and \nstops every heretical mouth that speaks utter wickedness.  For that which the \ncreator of everything himself, our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, established and \nbuilt up\u2014together with his disciples and apostles, and the holy fathers and teachers \nand martyrs who came after\u2014have been consecrated by their own works and \nwords, by their sufferings and sweat, by their labours and blood, and finally by their \nremarkable deaths for the sake of the Catholic and Apostolic Church of us who \nbelieve in him, they, through two words,11 uttered without pain or death\u2014O the \nlong-suffering and forbearance of God!\u2014are eager to dissolve and to set at naught \nthe great, all-illumining and all-praised mystery of the orthodox worship of the \nChristians. \nRoman Catholic scholars are eager to see in these words proleptic support for Papal \nprimacy.  They are certainly strong words, proclaiming the faithfulness of the church of \nRome to orthodoxy, and linking this to the words of our Lord in Matthew 16.18f.  They \nare, however, words about the church of Rome, not the papacy as such, and they are also \nwords written by Maximus in the glow of gratitude he must have felt, following the \nLateran synod, for the support he had found in Rome.  The faith signally endorsed by \nRome is founded on the apostles and their successors\u2014the fathers and the synods where \nthey declared their faith\u2014and something that has been tried in the suffering of their own \nlives, both the suffering of those who suffered persecution and martyrdom, and also \nthose who shone forth in the ascetic life.  They cannot be claimed as support for any \nnotion of papal authority that seeks to detach the pope from the faithful experience of \nthe Church.12  But these words make it clear that the institutional structures of the \nChurch, expressed in the priesthood and synodical convocations, were important for \nMaximos. \nOpusc. 12, which only exists in the fragments Anastasius the Librarian gathered and \ntranslated into Latin in the ninth century, speaks in similar terms of \u2018the apostolic see, \nwhich, from the incarnate Word of God himself, as well as, in accordance with the holy \ncanons and definitions, from all the holy synods of all the holy Churches of God, which \nare in all the world, has derived and possesses dominion (imperium), authority and power \nto bind and loose\u2019.  This letter was written a few years earlier, and is concerned with what \nprocess must be adopted by the one-time monothelite Patriarch of Constantinople, \nPyrrhos, if he wishes to be received as Orthodox.  Maximos insists that he needs to \nconvince the Pope of Rome, doubtless because in the hierarchy of the Byzantine Church, \nit was only the Pope who was senior to the Patriarch.  It is for this reason that, in \ncontrast with opusc. 11, opusc. 12 speaks directly of the sanctissimae Romanorum Ecclesiae \nbeatissimum papam.  Nevertheless, these two fragmentary letters make it clear that his \neschatological and eucharistic vision of the Church had quite precise institutional \nimplications. \nIt is, however, in the events that followed on the Lateran Synod\u2014Maximos\u2019 arrest, his \ntwo trials, his exiles and his death (which could well be described in the terms he used of \nthe deaths of the fathers in opusc. 11: \u2018finally\u2026 their remarkable deaths\u2019)\u2014that we see \nhow Maximos\u2019 ecclesiology was worked out in practice.  The Church is founded on the \nconfession of Christ: to be a member of the Church is \u2018to be Christ\u2019s and to bear his \nname\u2019, as we have quoted above.  For Maximos, such confession is crucial, and entails \naccepting the confession of Christ that we have received from the Apostles and the \nFathers of the Church.  So in his trial, Maximos responds to the accusation that he has \nsplit the Church by his stubbornness by saying: \u2018if the one who states what is in Scripture \nand the holy Fathers splits the Church, what does someone do to the Church who annuls \nthe teachings of the saints, without which the Church\u2019s very existence is impossible?\u201913  \nLater on, when asked about his own teaching, he retorts: \u2018I don\u2019t have a teaching of my \nown, but the common one of the Catholic Church.  I mean that I haven\u2019t initiated any \nexpression at all that could be called my own teaching.\u201914  At his trial he was pressed on \nthe fact that he was not in communion with the throne of Constantinople, something of \nutmost importance to Maximos, as his ecclesiology, as we have seen, is defined in terms \nof eucharistic communion.  But communion, for Maximos, is only genuine communion \nif it is communion in the truth, so he explains his not being in communion with \nConstantinople by reciting the ways in which the Patriarch has rejected the faith defined \nby the \u2018holy synods\u2019: by accepting the initial compromise at Alexandria in 633, and then \naccepting, indeed formulating, the imperial compromises of the Ekthesis and the Typos.15 \nAnother important issue raised at his trial was the claim on the Emperor\u2019s behalf that he \nwas a priest, a claim again made by the iconoclast emperors in the next century.  \nMaximos\u2019 rejection of this claim is outright; in response to the claim that \u2018every Christian \nemperor [is] also a priest\u2019, he declares; \nNo, he isn\u2019t. because he neither stands beside the altar, and after the consecration \nof the bread elevates it with the words, Holy things for the holy; nor does he baptize, \nnor perform the rite of anointing, nor does he ordain and make bishops and \npresbyters and deacons; nor does he anoint churches, nor does he bear the symbols \nof the priesthood, the omophorion and the Gospel book, [as he bears the symbols] of \nimperial office, the crown and the purple.16 \nIt is interesting, in view of the Mystagogia, that the argument is in terms of liturgical \nfunction, though the consequences are political.  In the dispute that took place during his \nfirst exile, at Bizya, with a Bishop Theodosios, whose task was to work a change of mind \nin Maximos, Maximos spells out one implication of the emperor\u2019s not sharing in the \npriestly office: namely, that the calling of a synod does not need the Emperor (although \nall the synods accepted as \u0153cumenical in the Orthodox Church have been called by \nemperors).  The confessor lists seven synods, called by emperors, which proved \nheretical.17 \nClearly, for Maximos, the Church, as defined by the true confession of faith, celebrated \nin the Divine Liturgy of the Eucharist, is a sovereign body, with its own institutions.  \nHowever, deeply bound up with the Christian Empire it might be, it may not be \nconfused with it.  A precious document for Maximos\u2019 doctrine of the Church is the last \nwriting we have from his hand, a short letter written on 19 April 658 to Anastasios, his \ndisciple and spiritual child of by then forty years\u2019 standing, who was exiled apart from his \nmaster.18  By then, Maximos and his few followers were on their own, Rome, in the \nperson of Pope Vitalian, having succumbed to imperial pressure and entered into \ncommunion with the other patriarchal sees.  In reply to the question\u2014or taunt\u2014\u2018What \nChurch do you belong to?  Constantinople?  Rome?  Antioch?  Alexandria?  Jerusalem?  \nSee, all of them are united, together with the provinces subject to them.\u2019  Maximos says \nhe had replied, \u2018The God of all pronounced that the Catholic Church was the correct and \nsaving confession of the faith in him when he called Peter blessed because of the terms \nin which he had made proper confession of him.\u2019  The Petrine foundation of the Church \nis Peter\u2019s faith, which even his successor can abandon, as Maximos had just learnt.  At \nthe end of the letter, there is a postscript from Anastasius himself, saying that this letter, \nand the rest of the dossier, had been transcribed  \nto make them known to you most holy people, in order that, when you have found \nour about the trial form these, you might all bring a common prayer to the Lord on \nbehalf of our common mother, that is the Catholic Church, and on behalf of us \nyour unworthy servants, for strengthening everyone and us also, persevering with \nyou in it, according to the orthodox faith rightly preached in it by the holy Fathers. \nLike the rest of the theology of St Maximos the Confessor, his ecclesiology combines an \ninspiring vision with ramifications as broad as the cosmos and as deep as the soul with \npractical implications that are uncompromising.  We have much to learn from him. \n                                                  \n1 There is, therefore, little on Maximos\u2019 ecclesiology in the secondary literature.  The \nchapter on ecclesiology in Jean-Claude Larchet, Saint Maxime le Confesseur (Paris: \u00c9ditions \ndu Cerf, 2003), 198-210, is limited in scope and is largely a summary of his discussion of \nthe more polemical issue of the Roman primacy in Maximos\u2019 writings found in idem, \nMaxime le Confesseur, m\u00e9diateur entre l\u2019Orient et l\u2019Occident (Paris: \u00c9ditions de Cerf, 1998), 125-\n201.  There are useful discussions in the following: Alain Riou, Le Monde et l\u2019\u00c9glise selon \nMaxime le Confesseur (Paris: Beauchesne, 1973), esp. 123-200; Nikos Matsoukas, Kosmos, \nAnthropos, Koinonia kata ton Maximo Homologiti (Athens: Ekdoseis Grigori, 1980), esp. 219-\n52 (largely expository); Nikolaos Loudovikos, He Eucharistiaki Ontologia (Athens: Ekdoseis \nDomos, 1992), 251-72 (a sophisticated development of \u2018eucharistic ecclesiology\u2019).  An \nolder, but still useful, discussion of the Mystagogia (largely concerned with the information \nit gives about the celebration of the liturgy) can be found in R\u00e9n\u00e9 Bornert, Les \ncommentaires byzantins de la divine liturgie du VIIe au XVe si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1966), pp. 83-124. \n2 For a critical text, see He Mystagogia tou Hagiou Maximou tou Homologitou, ed. Charalambos \nG. Sotiropoulos (rev. edn., Athens, 1993); English trans. (not always satisfactory) in \nMaximus Confessor: Selected Writings, trans. George C. Berthold (London: SPCK, 1985), \n181-225. \n3 Text in Migne, Patrologia Graeca 91: 137C-140B, 141A-146A.  French translations from \nthese, together with some other relevant passages, may be found in Appendix II in Riou, \nop. cit., 206-12. \n4 Now conveniently available in a critical text, with English translation, in Maximus the \nConfessor and his Companions. Documents from Exile, ed. and trans. Pauline Allen and \nBronwen Neil (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). \n5 It is worth noting that, in speaking of the Church, first, Maximos does not use any \ntechnical term for the unordained laity (such as the already well-established term, la\u00efkos), \nbut instead refers to \u2018all the faithful people\u2019, and secondly, naos means a temple, that is \nthe whole building (and is still used in that sense), so that the distinction is really between \nthe building as a whole and a special part of it, and analogously for the community. \n                                                                                                                                            \n6 Dionysios the Areopagite, Celestial Hierarchy 3.1. \n7 Berthold is wrong is asserting (op. cit. 222, n. 107) that this means the trisagion, which is \nsung in the Byzantine rite before the readings. \n8 Riou, op. cit., 165. \n9 The two Centuries on Theology and the Incarnate Dispensation can be found in Patrologia Graeca \n90.1083A-1173A; II.51-70 are in columns 1143-56.  There is a translation in Berthold, \nop. cit. 129-70, but I have used the translation in The Philokalia. The Complete Text, trans. \nand ed. G.E.H. Palmer, Philip Sherrard, Kallistos Ware, vol. 2 (London: Faber & Faber, \n1981), 114-63. \n10 The first five \u0153cumenical synods, together with the Lateran synod; the same list of six \nsynods it to be found in Theodore Spoudaios\u2019 Hypomnesticon, his summary of the \nsufferings of Martin and Maximos (Hypomnesticon 8, in Allen and Neil, op. cit., 160). \n11 These \u2018two words\u2019 must refer in some way to the imperial edicts (the Ekthesis of 638 \nand the Typos of 648) that promoted monothelitism and forbade any discussion of \nOrthodox dyothelitism. \n12 For more detail, see the article of Larchet\u2019s referred to above. \n13 Relatio motionis 4 (Allen-Neil, 58). \n14 Ibid. 6 (Allen-Neil, 60). \n15 Ibid. \n16 Ibid. 4 (Allen-Neil, 56). \n17 Disputatio 4 (Allen-Neil, 88). \n18 The letter can be found in Allen-Neil, 120-3. \n"}
