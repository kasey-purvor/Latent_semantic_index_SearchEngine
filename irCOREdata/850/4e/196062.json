Introduction\n[2] The generation of field\u2010aligned irregularities (FAIs) in\nthe ionospheric plasma density was one of the most unex-\npected results of early ionospheric modification experiments\ncarried out at the midlatitude heating facility in Platteville,\nColorado (40.2\u00b0N, 104.7\u00b0W). Intentional modification of\nthe ionosphere began there in 1970 in order to study the\ninteraction of ionospheric plasma waves with high\u2010power\nradio waves transmitted by a \u201cheater\u201d or \u201cpump\u201d. Observa-\ntions made between 1970 and 1973 revealed a number of\ncharacteristics of the FAIs [e.g., Thome and Blood, 1974;\nFialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974] involving their growth\nand decay times, preconditioning effects, and the depen-\ndence of the scattered signal strength on radar orientation.\n[3] Experiments carried out with the Platteville heater\nprompted the building of similar facilities in the United\nStates, the former Soviet Union, and northern Scandinavia\n[Yampolski et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 2003; Noble and\nDjuth, 1990]. Between 1977 and 1980 a high\u2010latitude\nheating facility was built near Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.6\u00b0N,\n19.2\u00b0E). Observations made at this heater have confirmed\nthe ubiquity and importance of FAI in heating experiments\n[e.g., Stubbe et al., 1982a]. In particular, it is thought that\nFAIs lead to anomalous absorption of the high\u2010power pump\n[e.g., Jones et al., 1982; Stubbe at al., 1982a; Robinson,\n1989], which in turn leads to large\u2010scale heating [e.g.,\nJones et al., 1986; Stocker et al., 1992; Honary et al., 1993].\n[4] Direct measurements of FAI at Troms\u00f8 have been\nmade using the Co\u2010operative UK Twin Located Auroral\nSounding System (CUTLASS) coherent backscatter radars\nin Finland and Iceland since these radars became operational\nin 1995 [Robinson et al., 1997, 1998]. In one early exper-\niment using the CUTLASS radar, Bond et al. [1997] studied\nthe form of the CUTLASS backscatter power distribution in\npatches of irregularities enhanced by the European Incoherent\nScatter (EISCAT) heater, both in range and in azimuth,\nusing static beam configurations. The distributions were\nfound to be approximately Gaussian, and the widths of the\npatches extended beyond that of the heater beam at its 3 dB\npoints. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms\ncontrol the distribution of the irregularities created by the\nheater at Troms\u00f8. A number of different contributing factors\nhave been suggested. These clearly include the power dis-\ntribution in the heater beam itself and the influence of the\nmagnetic field, which can affect both the refraction of heater\nrays and the anisotropic transport of electrons. In addition,\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, United Kingdom.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA014659\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A05307, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014659, 2010\nA05307 1 of 27\nthere is much evidence that mode conversion of radio waves\ninto electrostatic modes at the upper hybrid resonance is\nresponsible for the generation of FAIs [Stubbe et al., 1982b;\nRobinson, 1989, 2002]. Access to this resonance region by\nheater rays can thus influence where FAI can be excited. An\nexperiment designed to explore further the distribution of\nirregularities is outlined below. This experiment has enabled\nsome of these dependences to be tested. This uses a beam\u2010\nsweeping technique to extend the area of the illumination of\nthe ionosphere beyond the static beam geometry. The\nmeasured CUTLASS backscatter intensity distributions\nfrom irregularity patches are analyzed using a statistical\nmethod that yields information about the location and shape\nof the patches. This involves a moment analysis of the\nspatial distribution of the intensity of CUTLASS backscat-\nter. This method of analysis is ideal for investigating spatial\ndistributions as it allows them to be characterized by just a\nfew parameters without the need to examine a large number\nof individual data points. Using this method, we compare\nthe beam shape and irregularity distribution shape for a\nnumber of experimental configurations. In addition, a sim-\nple geometrical model based on the upper hybrid theory of\nFAI excitation is examined by this method. Before dealing\nwith the experimental data, and to provide a basic geomet-\nrical framework for describing and interpreting the results, a\nsimple upper hybrid FAI generation model is outlined in the\nnext section.\n2. A Simple Upper Hybrid Model\n[5] In a horizontally stratified ionosphere an O\u2010mode\nradio ray transmitted at an angle from vertical that is less\nthan the Spitze angle, \u0001S [Mj\u00f8lhus and Fl\u00c5, 1984;Mj\u00f8lhus et\nal., 2003], reflects at an altitude where the local electron\nplasma frequency is equal to the frequency of the trans-\nmitted wave, w. The O\u2010mode radio waves transmitted at an\nangle \u0001 from vertical that is greater than the Spitze angle\nreflect at a lower altitude than this. As long as the radio\npropagation frequency is at least a few times the electron\ngyrofrequency, wH, then the reflection occurs approximately\nat an altitude where [Davies, 1966]\n! \u00bc !p sec \u0001 \u00f01\u00de\nsuch that greater off\u2010zenith transmission angles cause the\nelectromagnetic wave to reflect at lower altitudes. This is\ntermed the secant law.\n[6] In the upper hybrid plane, U, resonant conversion of\nan O\u2010mode radio wave into upper hybrid wave modes can\nlead to the enhancement of electron density irregularities in\nthe ionospheric plasma and additional anomalous plasma\nheating. This plane occurs where the heater frequency\nequals the upper hybrid resonance frequency, wU, which\nobeys the relationship [e.g., Das and Fejer, 1979; Robinson,\n1989]\n!2U \u00bc !2p \u00fe !2H : \u00f02\u00de\nThus, the upper hybrid plane lies at an altitude hU above the\nground, between the reflection planes of the vertically\ntransmitted O\u2010 and X\u2010mode waves. Therefore, only O\u2010mode\nradio waves transmitted by the heater should be able to\nenhance FAIs, and this has been observed experimentally\n[e.g., Cohen and Whitehead, 1970; Jones et al., 1982;\nRobinson et al., 1998].\n[7] The secant law, equation (1), and upper hybrid rela-\ntion, equation (2), can be combined to produce a simple\nmodel that provides a horizontal width limit and position for\nthe patches of FAIs enhanced by the heater in the upper\nhybrid plane. Considering equation (1) with the requirement\nfor radio waves to reach an altitude hU for FAI enhancement\nto occur implies that if the heater beam transmission angle is\ngreat enough, then U is not reached by the transmitted\nwaves, and plasma density irregularities should not be\nenhanced there. This situation is illustrated schematically in\nFigure 1, which shows a simplified estimate of where the\npatches of irregularities may be positioned, assuming recti-\nlinear propagation of the heater waves, with no refraction.\nThe reflection plane of a vertically transmitted O\u2010mode\nwave and the upper hybrid plane, U, are shown as dotted\nand dashed lines, respectively. The critical transmission\nangle, \u0001C, and the limiting upper hybrid width of the patch\nof irregularities, wU, are given by\n\u0001C \u00bc sin\u00021 !H\n!\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u00f03\u00de\nand\nwU \u00bc 2hU tan \u0001C ; \u00f04\u00de\nrespectively. The reflection condition for heater rays trans-\nmitted at different angles from vertical, equation (1), places\na restriction on the area within which the rays are able to\nreach U, and the irregularities are expected to change form,\ndepending on where the heater beam is directed. This is\nparticularly the case if the heater beam is pointed outside of\nthe critical angle given by equation (3). It should be noted\nthat, given horizontal stratification, the conditions set by\nequations (3) and (4) represent a potential access window\nfor excitation of irregularities at hU that is not affected by\nany changes in the beam pointing direction. However, if\nstratification of the ionosphere were tilted, then the positions\nof the width limits would be shifted horizontally. A 10\u00b0 tilt\nin the ionospheric stratification results in an approximate\n30 km horizontal shift and 5 km change in width. Iono-\nspheric tilts therefore might cause a shift in the position of\npatches of FAIs from that expected from Figure 1.\n3. Instrumentation\n[8] This study mainly utilizes coherent backscatter data\nfrom the CUTLASS backscatter radar in Finland [Milan et\nal., 1997] to provide information about the spatial distri-\nbution of FAI produced by the Troms\u00f8 heater. However,\ndata from the EISCAT UHF radar [Rishbeth and Williams,\n1985] and the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde [Sedgemore et al., 1996;\nJones et al., 2000] have also been used to provide infor-\nmation about the background ionosphere. These systems\nand the EISCAT heater are briefly described below.\n3.1. European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Heater\n[9] The ionospheric modification facility situated at\nRamfj\u00f8rdmoen near Troms\u00f8, Norway, was built by the\nMax\u2010Planck\u2010Institut f\u00fcr Aeronomie and the University of\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n2 of 27\nTroms\u00f8, although it is now operated by the EISCAT\nScientific Association [Rietveld et al., 1993]. The heating\nfacility has 12 transmitters, with output powers of up to\n100 kW each, and has three antenna arrays of different\nfrequency ranges. Array 2, which was used during the\nbeam\u2010sweeping experiments studied here, contains six\nrows of six crossed dipoles, covers the frequency range\n3.75\u20135.65 MHz, and has a gain of 24 \u00b1 1 dB. This produces\na beam width of 14.5\u00b0 and a maximum effective radiated\npower (ERP) of 300 MW. The beam width increases if\nfewer than the maximum number of transmitters is used, due\nto the widening of the interference pattern that is produced.\n[10] The frequency, polarization, beam direction, and\nmaximum power of the heater are normally set up during\ntuning; however, these parameters can be changed during a\nheating experiment without the need to retune. The east\u2010\nwest orientation of the dipole antennas allows the heater\nbeam pointing direction to be tilted in the north\u2010south plane\nby varying the phases between pairs of transmitters driving\neach row of antennas.\n3.2. Co\u2010operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding\nSystem (CUTLASS)\n[11] CUTLASS forms part of the Super Dual Auroral\nRadar Network (SuperDARN) of high\u2010frequency backscat-\nter radars [Greenwald et al., 1995]. The radars use coherent\nbackscatter to study Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere and iono-\nsphere. The field\u2010aligned nature of the irregularities requires\nthe wave vector of the CUTLASS radio waves, kr, to be\ndirected orthogonally to the geomagnetic field vector, B0 at\nthe point of scatter. At high latitudes, where B0 is near\nvertical, this is achievable in both the E and F regions of the\nionosphere due to refraction of the radio waves. The\nCUTLASS radars, located at Hankasalmi (62.3\u00b0N, 26.6\u00b0E)\nin Finland and Pykkvib\u00e6r (63.7\u00b0N, 19.2\u00b0W) in Iceland, are\nideally situated to view FAIs generated by the EISCAT\nheater (see Figure 2).\n[12] The CUTLASS Finland and Iceland radars have been\noperational since February and November 1995, respec-\ntively, and data from CUTLASS Finland have been used to\nstudy the patches of irregularities excited by the EISCAT\nheater. Both CUTLASS radars operate between 8 and\n20 MHz and consist of a 16\u2010antenna main array, which\ntransmits and receives, and a 4\u2010antenna interferometer array,\nwhich receives only. The degree of refraction suffered by\nthe rays in the ionosphere is dependent upon the CUTLASS\nfrequency as well as on ionospheric conditions. Orthogo-\nnality with Earth\u2019s magnetic field direction, therefore, occurs\nat different altitudes when using different CUTLASS fre-\nquencies such that different cross sections of measurement\nare made through the modified region of the ionosphere.\n[13] During the experiments that have been studied the\nCUTLASS Finland frequency scanned between 18 and\n19.5 MHz, and backscatter power values were provided\nwith a 1 s time resolution. The range resolution, that is, the\nsize of the range gates, was 15 km. Only beam 5 of the radar\nFigure 1. A simple representation of transmitted radio waves and their planes of reflection. The dotted\nline indicates the plane of reflection of a vertically transmitted radio wave, and the dashed line indicates\nthe upper hybrid plane, the plane of reflection of a radio wave transmitted at an angle \u0001C from vertical.\nRays transmitted at angles within the shaded region will reflect at or above the upper hybrid height. Rays\ntransmitted at angles outside of the shaded region will not reach the upper hybrid height.\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n3 of 27\nFigure 2.

The gray area indicates the region covered by beam\n5 of the radar, the red vertical lines indicate the 3 dB width of the heater beam while it is pointed at various\ndirections between 30\u00b0 north, vertical (V), and 30\u00b0 south, and the upper and lower red horizontal lines\nindicate the 3 dB width of the heater beam when it is pointed 30\u00b0 north and 30\u00b0 south, respectively.\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n4 of 27\nwas in operation, and this intersects the region directly\nabove the Troms\u00f8 heater. The distance to first range gate is\n480 km in this scan mode, and 75 range gates are sampled.\nAnalysis of the autocorrelation functions is used to derive\nthe backscatter power, line\u2010of\u2010sight Doppler velocity, and\nspectral width. The backscatter power is the only one of the\nthree derived parameters used in this study. In addition,\nresults are presented from only the Finnish component of the\nCUTLASS pair since the Icelandic radar receives weaker\nand more variable backscatter powers due to the longer\npropagation path and the unlikelihood of achieving orthog-\nonality with the magnetic field lines at the position of the\nirregularities.\n[14] It is assumed that the CUTLASS rays intersect the\npatches of FAIs at a constant height, hU, above the heater.\nThis is a good approximation, given the low\u2010angle trajectory\nof the radar beam at long ranges (\u223c1000 km). In reality the\northogonality condition requires the rays to propagate at an\nangle \u0001B0 = 12\u00b0 from horizontal. As is well known, the linear\nbackscatter power measured by CUTLASS is proportional\nto the square of the electron density perturbation amplitudes\nin the ionosphere [e.g., Schlegel, 1996]. Thus, the CUTLASS\nbackscatter power provides direct measurements of the\nmean intensity of FAI inside the scattering volume at each\nrange.\n3.3. Troms\u00f8 Dynasonde\n[15] Data from the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde have been used to\nmonitor the change in the foF2 during the heating experi-\nments. Close to the foF2 the reflection altitude of the\ntransmitted wave increases greatly with small increases in\nwave frequency [Davies, 1966]. If the frequency of a\ntransmitted radio wave is close to the foF2, then severe re-\nfraction of the wave can occur in this area since the electron\ndensity gradient of the ionosphere is large and an electro-\nmagnetic wave is able to travel a significant distance in the\nhorizontal direction prior to reflection. At frequencies con-\nsiderably below the foF2 there is a much sharper electron\ndensity boundary, and rectilinear propagation up to the re-\nflection point is obeyed to a good approximation. Although\nthe values of the foF2 obtained from the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde\ndid vary during the beam\u2010sweeping runs, they remained high\nenough for overdense heating; therefore FAI enhancement\nwas possible throughout the beam\u2010sweeping runs.\n3.4. EISCAT UHF Radar\n[16] The EISCAT UHF radar is an incoherent scatter radar\nwith a 933 MHz transmitter located at Troms\u00f8 and receivers\nat Troms\u00f8 and Kiruna, Sweden, and Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland\n[Evans, 1969]. Details of the early results obtained by the\nEISCAT radars are given by Rishbeth and van Eyken\n[1993]. For the following investigation, electron density\nprofiles provided by the EISCAT UHF radar were used to\nestimate a value of the upper hybrid height, hU. In these\nEISCAT UHF data a heater\u2010induced ionline overshoot\noccurs at the altitude where the plasma frequency is equal to\nthe heater frequency, causing an apparent enhancement in\nthe electron density [Jones et al., 1986; Rietveld et al.,\n2000]. The height difference, Dz, between this altitude\nlevel and the upper hybrid level, U, can be determined, and\nRietveld et al. [1993] state a typical value of 6 km. The\nionline overshoots observed in the EISCAT UHF data\noccurred at approximately 200 km altitude during the three\nbeam\u2010sweeping runs. It was also found that hU differed from\nthis 200 km altitude by a few kilometers, and since this is\nmuch less than the CUTLASS range resolution, a value of\n200 kmwas assumed for hU. The upper hybrid width was thus\ncalculated to be approximately 130 km, using equations (3)\nand (4).\n4. Statistical Relations\n4.1. CUTLASS Backscatter Power Data\n[17] Each CUTLASS range gate, r, is associated with a\nvalue of linear backscatter power, p. The linear power is\ncalculated from the logarithmic signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio ( pdB)\nusing\np \u00bc 10pdB=10: \u00f05\u00de\nIf range gates r1, r2,\u2026, rJ,\u2026 occur with powers p1, p2,\u2026,\npJ,\u2026, respectively, and P is the sum of the backscatter\npowers across all CUTLASS ranges (\u2211 pi), then the arith-\nmetic mean of the distribution is given by [Spiegel, 1972]\nr \u00bc\nPJ\ni\u00bc1\npiri\nP\n\u00f06\u00de\nThe statistical moments of the distribution are given by\nmn \u00bc\nPJ\ni\u00bc1\npi\u00f0ri \u0002 r\u00den\nP\n\u00f07\u00de\nfor n = 0, 1, 2,\u2026. Here, mn is the nth statistical moment\nabout the mean. Clearly, by definition, m1 = 0. In this study\nwe utilize P and moments m2, m3, and m4 only. The variance\ncorresponds to n = 2, and its square root is the standard\ndeviation, or statistical width, s. The skewness and kurtosis\nof the distribution correspond to n = 3 and n = 4, respec-\ntively. Skewness is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of\na distribution such that a symmetrical distribution has a zero\nskewness. Kurtosis is a measure of the degree of peakedness\nof a distribution. The value of kurtosis gives an indication of\nthe shape of the patch of irregularities, the kurtosis being\ngreater for more sharply peaked distributions and for dis-\ntributions with more than one peak.\n[18] In the following analysis, both the skewness and\nkurtosis are used in their dimensionless forms. The dimen-\nsionless moments about the mean are given by\nan \u00bc mn\n\u0003n\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere an is the nth dimensionless moment about the mean\nand mn is defined in equation (7). Kurtosis is probably the\nleast familiar of the four moments dealt with, so it is worth\nshowing some values for some familiar distributions. Table 1\nshows the kurtoses of some simple symmetrical, continuous\ndistributions. The kurtoses of the backscatter power profiles\ncan later be compared with the kurtoses of these distribu-\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n5 of 27\ntions in order to get an indication of the underlying shapes\nof the patches.\n[19] In addition to a statistical width, it is also useful to\ncalculate a threshold width of the CUTLASS backscatter\npower distributions, similar to that employed by Bond et al.\n[1997]. This width provides a means of revealing the\nthreshold pump power since the threshold width limits\ndefine the edges of a patch of irregularities where the\namplitude has been raised above that of the background.\n[20] The summed power of the patches of irregularities\nhelps to determine whether the relationship between the\nheater beam power and the patch power is nonlinear. The\nmean positions and skewnesses of patches can be used to\nindicate the effects of changing the heater beam pointing\ndirection and for identifying whether there is any influence\non the patches from Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The widths of\nthe patches, particularly the threshold widths, can be com-\npared with the upper hybrid widths calculated using\nequations (3) and (4) in order to test the upper hybrid theory\nof irregularity generation. The kurtoses of the power dis-\ntributions are a measure of the flatness of the patches and\ncan be used to identify saturation of the irregularity ampli-\ntude, which is likely to produce a smaller value of patch\nkurtosis.\n4.2. Heater Beam Model\n[21] Heater beam power distributions were modeled using\nthe EZNEC version 4 software (http:\/\/www.eznec.com).\nThe distributions can be produced for any combination of\nheater frequency and transmitters employed during heating\nexperiments. The software provides power distributions as a\nfunction of beam angle, a, relative to the vertical between\n\u221290\u00b0 and +90\u00b0 with a 1\u00b0 resolution. The statistical moments\nof the heater beam power distributions as a function of the\nCUTLASS range can be compared directly to the moments\nderived from CUTLASS backscatter power data in order to\nexamine the extent to which the local heater power density\ncontrols irregularity excitation.\n[22] Statistical moments of the modeled power distribu-\ntions were calculated using equations (6) to (8) and the peak\nposition, peak power, and 3 dB half width determined using\na least\u2010squares\u2010fit parabola to the 15 modeled data points\naround the maximum power provided by the software in\ndecibels, that is, the maximum decibel power and seven\nmodeled data points either side of this. Linear interpolation\nbetween those values that were closest to 3 dB below\nthe peak allows the 3 dB points of the distribution to be\ndetermined.\n[23] Since the CUTLASS backscatter data are provided as\na function of range in kilometers, the statistical parameters\nof the modeled heater beam distributions must also be\nconsidered as a function of CUTLASS range rather than\nbeam angle. The modeled heater beam power distributions\ncan be mapped onto U using\nR\u00f0\u0004\u00de \u00bc hU tan\u0004\u00fe R0; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere R0 is the range to the center of the heater beam. The\nvalues of the ERP at this altitude are calculated using\np\u00f0R\u00f0\u0004\u00de\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0\u0004\u00deh\n2\nU\nh2U sec\n2 \u0004\n; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere p(R(a)) is the linear ERP of the heater beam as a\nfunction of CUTLASS range and p(a) is the linear ERP of\nthe heater beam as a function of angle. Mapping the dis-\ntributions onto U biases the power toward the center of the\ndistribution, resulting in slightly narrower widths.\n4.3. Comparison of CUTLASS and Modeled Heater\nBeam Power Distributions\n[24] In order to provide a guide to the meaning of the\nmoments in the main beam, here a comparison is made\nbetween the statistical parameters of a typical heated patch\nand the corresponding modeled heater beam power distri-\nbution for a static, vertically pointing beam geometry\n(a model for the swept beam geometry will be outlined in\nsection 6). The CUTLASS range\u2010time\u2010intensity (RTI) plot of\na patch produced during a static, vertically directed beam\ntransmission soon after the beam\u2010sweeping experiments being\nconsidered is displayed in Figure 3. The corresponding\nbackscatter power distribution of the patch is also shown,\ncalculated by averaging the backscatter power measured in\neach CUTLASS range over the time period for which the\nheater was switched on. The dashed line shows the power\ndistribution of the modeled heater beam. There is a good\ncorrelation between the position of the patch and the main\nbeam.\n[25] The values of the statistical parameters calculated for\nthe patch power distribution and the modeled heater beam\npower distribution of Figure 3 are presented in Table 2. The\nstatistical parameters for the beam both with and without the\nside lobes are provided. This was considered necessary\nsince both the kurtosis and the statistical width of the beam\nare sensitive to the presence of even small side lobes and are\nincreased in value when the side lobes are taken into account.\n[26] The statistical parameters of the patch power distri-\nbution given in Table 2 match well with those of the\nmodeled heater beam power distribution without side lobes.\nThe mean positions of the two distributions are within a few\nkilometers of each other, as are the values of the statistical\nwidths. The threshold width of the patch is significantly\nlarger than the 3 dB width of the beam, suggesting that the\nbeam is able to excite irregularities well outside of its 3 dB\nwidth. This is likely to be the case when the transmitted\npower density is well above the threshold required for FAI\nexcitation. The skewness of the main beam is 0, indicating a\nsymmetrical distribution, whereas the distribution of the\nwhole beam is slightly negatively skewed, as is that of the\npatch. Finally, the kurtoses of the beam and patch power\ndistributions are comparable when the side lobes of the\nbeam are neglected. In general the statistical parameters of\nthe patch lie between those of the main beam and those of\nthe whole beam, the exception being the skewness of the\nTable 1.

Experimental Arrangement\n[27] The relationship between heater beam pointing\ndirection and the strength of artificial FAI has been investi-\ngated by studying backscatter data measured by CUTLASS\nFinland during three beam\u2010sweeping experiments carried out\nat the EISCAT heating facility on 6 October 1998. During\neach beam\u2010sweeping run the heater power and frequency\nwere kept fixed at 900 kW and 4.54 MHz, respectively. All\n12 transmitters were used, and the beam pointing direction\nwas made to complete a repetitive sawtooth motion. A single\nsweep entailed moving the beam pointing direction at a\nconstant angular rate through 60\u00b0 along the north\u2010south\ngeographic meridian between +30\u00b0 (north) and \u221230\u00b0 (south)\nfrom vertical. The beam then rapidly returned to the +30\u00b0\nposition to begin the next sweep. The beam pointing was\nestablished through phasing of the antennas, and the return to\nthe +30\u00b0 pointing direction was almost instantaneous. Each\nof the beam\u2010sweeping runs that have been studied spanned a\n10 min interval with sweeps of 60, 10, or 1 s duration,\ncorresponding to sweep rates of 1\u00b0, 6\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 min\u22121,\nrespectively. A short interval at the beginning of the second\nbeam\u2010sweeping run consisted of sweeps of 40 s duration,\nand this stage was not included in the study since the period\ncomprised only two sweeps of the beam. Details of the three\nperiods of beam sweeping studied, labeled A\u2013C, are given\nin Table 3.\n[28] Observations of the heated patches made by\nCUTLASS and the statistical parameters of the power dis-\ntributions in the patches calculated from the CUTLASS data\nare described in the following sections. A comparison of the\nCUTLASS data is made with modeled heater beam power\ndistributions obtained from the EZNEC version 4 software\nin order to determine the extent to which the heater beam\ncontrols the shape, size, and position of the patches of FAIs.\nAn explanation of the results is then discussed.\n[29] The RTI plots of backscatter data obtained from\nCUTLASS Finland during the three beam\u2010sweeping runs\nare given in Figure 4. Figure 4 (top, middle, and bottom)\nshows data obtained during runs A\u2013C, respectively. In\nFigure 4, 0 km on the range axis represents the point along\nthe CUTLASS beam that is vertically above the heater. This\nmeans that we set R0 to 0. Negative ranges are toward the\nCUTLASS radar, and positive ranges are farther away. The\ndashed horizontal lines indicate the limits of the upper\nhybrid width (130 km wide), and the solid horizontal lines\nsignify the outer 3 dB points of the transmitted heater beam\nat the extremes of the sweeps as obtained from the EZNEC\nversion 4 model (250 km wide). The data associated with\nthe slowest beam\u2010sweeping run, shown in Figure 4 (top),\ncan be resolved into individual sweeps of 60 s duration each.\nHigh\u2010power irregularities are observed to persist until sub-\nsequent sweeps at a range of approximately \u221230 km, while\nat all other CUTLASS ranges they rapidly disappear. This\npersistence was also documented by Dhillon [2001]. The\nrelatively slow sweep rate employed during the short\ninterval at the beginning of run B is visible at the left edge of\nFigure 4 (middle). With the exception of this region, the data\nfor runs B and C cannot be resolved into their individual\nsweeps since these were of much shorter duration than the\nsweeps of run A and are comparable with the CUTLASS\ntime resolution. Data in Figure 4 (bottom), associated with\nrun C, show two distinct bands of high\u2010power irregularities\nfrom 1456:00 UT onward, lying close to CUTLASS ranges\nof +45 and \u221245 km. Prior to this time only one band of\nirregularities was present. The data in Figure 4 are posi-\ntioned approximately symmetrically about 0 km, extending\nto just beyond the upper hybrid width limit in both direc-\ntions and remaining well within the regions swept out by the\nheater beam.\n6. Analysis\n6.1. Heater Beam Model\n[30] Before we present the results of the statistical\nmoment analysis of the CUTLASS intensity distribution\ndata, we outline the power distribution of the modeled\nheater beam during the beam sweeps. Heater beam power\ndistributions as a function of beam angle have been modeled\nusing the EZNEC version 4 software for the heater frequency\nand transmitters employed during the beam\u2010sweeping\nexperiments. A modeled heater beam power distribution has\nbeen produced for heater beam transmission angles, \u0001, be-\ntween 0\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 from vertical, inclusively. It is assumed\nthat the power distributions are symmetrical about the vertical\nbeam pointing direction, so it is unnecessary to calculate\npower distributions for \u0001 lying between +1\u00b0 and +30\u00b0.\nFigure 5 displays the modeled power distributions for heater\nbeam transmission angles between 0\u00b0 and \u221229\u00b0. The dotted\nlines represent the limits of the upper hybrid width, which\nare positioned symmetrically about a = 0. As the heater\nbeam pointing direction moves farther from vertical, the\nposition of the main beam shifts toward the left side of\nFigure 5, toward negative values of a, and the magnitude\nand number of side lobes toward the right side of Figure 5\nTable 2.

The statistical moments, peak position, peak\npower, and 3 dB half width of each of these distributions\ncan be calculated as described in section 4.2. For the heater\nbeam power distributions corresponding to \u0001 = \u00b123\u00b0, two\nequal\u2010valued maximum powers were provided by the beam\u2010\nmodeling software, so in this case both of these points and\nseven points either side of them were used for the fitting of\nthe parabola.\nFigure 4. CUTLASS RTI plots showing the backscatter power measured during 60, 10, and 1 s beam\u2010\nsweeping experiments. The dashed lines indicate the upper hybrid width limits, and the solid lines indicate\nthe positions of the 3 dB points of the heater beam at the extremes of the sweeps. The slower sweep rate at\nthe beginning of the second run is evident in Figure 4 (middle).\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n9 of 27\nFigure 5\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n10 of 27\n[31] Figure 6 (top) displays the summed power (Figure 6a),\nmean position (Figure 6b), 3 dB half width (Figure 6c),\nstatistical width (Figure 6d), skewness (Figure 6e), and\nkurtosis (Figure 6f) of the modeled beam power distributions\nas they vary with heater beam transmission angle. Figure 6\n(bottom) displays these same parameters for the power dis-\ntributions without the side lobes, which were removed by\ncutting off the heater beam power distributions at the values\nof a where the first minima in linear power occur at either\nside of the main beam.\n[32] There is a drop in power when the heater beam is\npointed farther from vertical, observed in Figure 6a (top),\nsince there is a greater distance from the heater to U for\nlarger angular displacements of the heater beam.\n[33] The dashed lines in Figure 6b (top, bottom) represent\nequality between the position of \u0001 when projected onto U\nand the range along the CUTLASS beam from R0 in this\nplane. The mean beam position matches the line when only\nthe main heater beam is taken into account, as in Figure 6b\n(bottom). It is evident that the effect of the side lobes is to\ncause the mean position of the heater beam to deviate from\nthe line toward the vertical direction, particularly when the\nangular displacement of the beam from vertical is greater,\nwhen the side lobes are at their most powerful and most\nnumerous.\n[34] The variations of the 3 dB half width with trans-\nmission angle, shown in Figure 6c (top, bottom), are iden-\ntical since in both cases it is the half width of the main beam\nthat is considered, independent of the side lobes. The 3 dB\nhalf width increases between heater beam transmission\nangles of 0\u00b0 and \u00b130\u00b0, but by less than 10 km. Since the\nCUTLASS Finland radar has only a 15 km resolution, a\n10 km change in patch width would not be resolved. A\nsimilarly small increase of less than 10 km is observed in the\nstatistical width of the main beam in Figure 6d (bottom)\nbetween \u0001 = 0\u00b0 and \u00b130\u00b0. The statistical width in Figure 6d\n(top) displays a large 80 km increase between heater beam\ntransmission angles of 0\u00b0 and \u00b130\u00b0, as a consequence of the\nbeam side lobes. The side lobes, which are small for vertical\npointing of the heater beam, become larger with increasing\nangular displacement from vertical, resulting in a larger\nstatistical width of the power distribution. However, the\npresence of even the small side lobes at \u0001 = 0\u00b0 produces a\nstatistical width of almost 40 km, which is considerably\nlarger than the approximate 20 km statistical width of the\nmain beam.\n[35] The power distributions in Figure 5 become less\nsymmetrical as the heater beam is pointed farther from\nvertical, mainly due to the change in the side lobes. When\nthe beam points in the negative direction, as is the case for\nthe power distributions displayed in Figure 6, the side lobes\nare on the positive side of the main beam and the skewness\nbecomes more positive as \u0001 becomes more negative. Con-\nversely, for positive angular displacements (not shown), the\nside lobes are on the negative side of the main beam and\nthese distributions have a negative skewness. This change in\nskewness is observed in Figure 6e (top) until an angular\ndisplacement of approximately 20\u00b0 from vertical. Beyond\nthis, the magnitude of the skewness decreases as the number\nof side lobes remains steady and their power increases, thus\nmaking them more comparable in size with the main beam,\nwhich decreases in power. Figure 6e (bottom) indicates that\nthe main beam without side lobes is actually skewed in the\nopposite direction. The magnitudes of skewness of the main\nbeam distributions are relatively small, so the distributions\nare effectively symmetrical.\n[36] The main beam power distributions in Figure 5 are\nslightly sharper for greater angular displacements of the\nheater beam from vertical, as deduced from the increasing\nkurtosis with increasing transmission angle in Figure 6f\n(bottom). The increase in kurtosis is less than 0.5, and the\nmain beam powers resemble a flattened Gaussian distribu-\ntion. The relatively large values of kurtosis observed in\nFigure 6f (top) are a consequence of the multipeaked nature\nof the full beam since this statistical moment is very sen-\nsitive to noncomparable peaks within a distribution. At\nangular displacements of the beam that are greater than 20\u00b0\nthe kurtosis rapidly decreases as the number of beam side\nlobes stops changing and their growth, together with a\ndecrease in strength of the main beam, results in a flatter\ndistribution.\n6.2. CUTLASS Data\n6.2.1. Run A: Slowest Beam Sweeps\n[37] The statistical parameters calculated from the CUTLASS\ndata corresponding to beam\u2010sweeping run A are plotted\nagainst time in Figure 7. Vertical lines indicate the beginning\nof each sweep when the heater beam pointing direction was\nchanged from \u221230\u00b0 (southward) to +30\u00b0 (northward). The\nhorizontal line in Figures 7a and 7c indicates the position\nvertically above the heater, and the dashed horizontal line in\nFigure 7d indicates the value of the upper hybrid width\ncalculated using equations (3) and (4).\n[38] Notice that the summed power of the patch, shown in\nFigure 7b, increases and decreases with time as the heater\nbeam transmission angle varies between +30\u00b0 (northward)\nand \u221230\u00b0 (southward). During the first few sweeps of the\nbeam the summed power peaks close to when the heater\nbeam is pointed vertically, in the middle of the sweep. For\nlater sweeps, however, the peak of the summed power\noccurs approximately halfway through the southward point-\ning half of the sweep.\n[39] The mean position of the patch of FAIs, shown in\nFigure 7c, varies between slightly positive and negative\nranges as the heater beam direction is moved from north-\nward to southward pointing. Apart from the results of the\nfirst beam sweep, which show a maximum mean position of\n40 km occurring approximately 5 s after the start of the\nsweep, the most positive mean patch position of 20 km\noccurs approximately 15 s after the start of each sweep. The\nmost negative mean patch position of \u221250 km occurs very\nclose to when the heater beam is pointed in its most\nFigure 5. Heater beam power distributions, as a function of angle, produced by the EZNEC version 4 software for an\nazimuth of 180\u00b0. A distribution is displayed for beam pointing directions between 0\u00b0 and \u221229\u00b0 from vertical at 1\u00b0 resolution.\nThe pointing direction of the heater beam is given for each case, and the dotted lines indicate the limits of the upper hybrid\nwidth.\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n11 of 27\nFigure 6\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n12 of 27\nsouthward direction for all sweeps. During earlier sweeps\nthe mean position of the patch lies vertically above the\nheater when the heater beam is pointed vertically, at the\ncenter of the sweep. During later sweeps the mean position\nof the patch lies vertically above the heater a few seconds\nafter the heater beam is pointed vertically. Clearly there is a\nlarge bias of mean position toward negative values despite\nthe apparent symmetrical placement of the patch about\n0 km, which is observed in the CUTLASS RTI plot in\nFigure 7a. This bias is due to the effect of the strong, per-\nsisting irregularities positioned close to \u221230 km.\n[40] The threshold width of the patch, displayed in Figure 7d,\ntakes values close to 200 km at the start of each sweepwith the\nexception of the first. It then rapidly decreases to approxi-\nmately 150 km, remaining at this value for the second half\nof each sweep. These values of threshold width are much\nsmaller than the 250 km width swept out by the heater beam.\nHowever, the steady 150 km value of threshold width lies\nclose to the 130 km value of the upper hybrid width cal-\nculated using equations (3) and (4). The statistical width,\ncalculated from equation (7), is also relatively large close to\nthe beginning of each sweep before decreasing to a steady\nvalue of 20 km, which is retained during the second half of\nthe sweeps. For the first 10 s of each sweep, as \u0001 changes\nfrom +30\u00b0 to +20\u00b0, the statistical width increases from\n20 km to a maximum value of approximately 30 km in the\nfirst sweep and 50 km in the final few sweeps.\n[41] For the first 20 s of each sweep the skewness, shown\nin Figure 7f, is observed to decrease, taking a minimum\nvalue after this time. For sweeps earlier on in the run the\ndecrease is from +1 to \u22121, later becoming a decrease from\n+2 to \u22121. Between 20 and 45 s after the start of each sweep,\nthe skewness increases to positive values of approximately\n+1 again. The patch tends to become positively skewed\nslightly before the middle of the sweep, passing the point of\nsymmetry while the heater beam is still directed northward.\nAfter 45 s from the start of the sweeps, the skewness\ndecreases again, and in some cases becomes negative, before\na rapid increase to +1 or +2 as a new sweep begins.\n[42] The kurtosis of the patch, displayed in Figure 7g,\ndecreases to a value of approximately 2 within the first 10 s\nof each sweep, from values of around 8 for sweeps at the\nbeginning of the run to 10 for sweeps toward the end of the\nrun. There is then a slow rise in kurtosis, up to a value of\napproximately 6. After 45 s from the start of the sweeps, the\nkurtosis decreases to values of 2\u20133 before rising sharply as a\nnew sweep begins.\n6.2.2. Run B: Intermediate\u2010Rate Beam Sweeps\n[43] Figure 8 displays the time dependence of the statis-\ntical parameters of CUTLASS data associated with beam\u2010\nsweeping run B after a running average was performed. The\nCUTLASS data had a time resolution of 1 s, and the running\naverage involved calculating the mean power of each set of\nthree consecutive power values in order to reduce noise. The\npoint vertically above the heater is again indicated in\nFigures 8a and 8c by a horizontal line, and the mean value\nof each statistical parameter is plotted as a dotted line. Since\nthe CUTLASS time resolution was 1 s, during which the\nheater beam moved through 6\u00b0, the variation of the statis-\ntical parameters during any one sweep could not be deter-\nmined to as great an accuracy as for run A, so only a\ndescription of the overall variation of the parameters is given\nhere.\n[44] All statistical parameters display a periodic depen-\ndence on time, with a variable amplitude and median value.\nThe amplitude and median value of the summed patch\npower decrease with time as the run progresses. The mean\npatch position is more consistent, varying between +20 and\n\u221240 km during each sweep. The threshold width of the patch\nalso remains steady, with a very small, approximately 25 km,\namplitude of variation. A relatively large 200 km value is\nobserved rather than the 150 km of run A. The statistical\nwidth consistently varies between 50 and 30 km. The patch\nskewness varies between 0 and +2 during earlier sweeps and\nbetween \u22121 and +1 toward the end of the run. The kurtosis\ndisplays a similar change, varying between 2 and 7 during\nearlier sweeps and between 2 and 4 during later sweeps.\n6.2.3. Run C: Fastest Beam Sweeps\n[45] During the fastest beam sweeps, run C, when \u0001 was\nchanged from +30\u00b0 (northward) to \u221230\u00b0 (southward) in 1 s,\nthe transmitted heater beam formed an effective power\ndistribution, wider than a stationary heater beam distribu-\ntion. Figure 9a displays the power profile of a modeled\n\u201cvirtual\u201d beam created from a superposition of the individ-\nual power profiles provided by the software after modifying\nthose corresponding to \u0001 = 0\u00b0 and \u221224\u00b0. This was produced\nby summing the power values associated with a particular\nvalue of a for each of the beam pointing directions between\n+30\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 and dividing by the number of pointing\ndirections. The power profile has been projected ontoU using\nequations (9) and (10), and the dashed lines indicate the\nupper hybrid width limits. Figure 9b shows the distribution\nproduced after superposition of the individual power pro-\nfiles without their side lobes. Table 4 displays the statistical\nmoments of these effective power distributions. Clearly the\nstatistical widths of the two distributions are comparable,\nwhile the kurtoses take very different values. The relatively\nlarge value of kurtosis of beam (a) is noninformative since\nthis is due to the irregular shape of the distribution caused\nby the heater beam side lobes. The value of kurtosis of beam\n(b) is comparable with those of the observed heated patches,\nwhile it is meaningless to make a comparison between the\nheated patches and beam (a).\n[46] Figure 10 displays the statistical parameters of\nCUTLASS Finland data measured during the beam sweeps\ncommencing at 1454:00 UT (run C). As with runs A and B,\na running average was performed on the CUTLASS data\nprior to carrying out the calculations. Again, the horizontal\ndashed line in Figure 10d indicates the size of the upper\nhybrid width and the horizontal solid line in Figures 10a and\n10c indicates the position vertically above the heater. The\nmean value of each statistical parameter is again plotted as a\nFigure 6.

The statistical moments for these distributions are given in Table 4.\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n16 of 27\ndotted line, and the green lines indicate the values of the\nstatistical moments of the modeled virtual beam summed\nwithout the side lobes. The mean position and skewness of\nthe modeled virtual beam summed with the side lobes are\nequal to those of the modeled virtual beam summed without\nthe side lobes; however, the statistical width and kurtosis\nvalues are much greater and are not visible on the scales in\nFigure 10. The values of the statistical parameters for the\nmodeled virtual beam summed with and without the side\nlobes are displayed in Table 4. The CUTLASS statistical\nparameters in Figure 10 show roughly constant values\nthroughout the run, although both the summed power and\nskewness of the patch increase slightly as the run progresses.\n[47] Figure 11a displays, in decibels, the modeled virtual\nbeam power distribution, summed without side lobes, and\naveraged CUTLASS Finland backscatter power profiles\ncalculated for each of the three beam\u2010sweeping runs. The\npositions of the vertical and magnetic field directions are\nindicated by solid and dot\u2010dashed vertical lines, respec-\ntively, and the upper hybrid width limits are indicated by\ndotted vertical lines. The three CUTLASS power distribu-\ntions in Figure 11a are roughly parabolic, although the\ndistributions from runs A and B display an additional peak\nin the magnetic field direction, while the distribution from\nrun C shows a dip of a few decibels in the vertical direction.\nIt is clear that the virtual beam power distribution Figure 11a\nis much wider than the CUTLASS backscatter power\ndistributions.\n[48] Figure 11 summarizes and compares the values of\nmean position (Figure 11b), threshold width (Figure 11c),\nstatistical width (Figure 11d), skewness (Figure 11e), and\nkurtosis (Figure 11f) of the mean linear backscatter power\ndistributions of all three runs and the statistical moments of\nthe virtual beam power distribution. It is apparent from\nFigure 11 that the statistical moments of patches created\nduring beam\u2010sweeping runs C and B are more comparable\nwith the statistical parameters of the virtual beam than are\nthose from beam\u2010sweeping run A, suggesting that these\nfaster beam sweeps, and particularly run C, have an effect\nthat is similar to that of a wider\u2010than\u2010usual heater beam. The\nvirtual beam is symmetrical, with a mean position of zero,\nwhile the CUTLASS data are positively skewed and have\nnegative mean positions. The mean position of the patch\ncreated during run A is between 10 and 15 km closer to\nCUTLASS than the mean positions of patches created\nduring runs B and C, and is least comparable with the mean\nposition of the virtual beam distribution. The most sym-\nmetrical CUTLASS power profile is that of run C, with a\nskewness of 0.2. The two CUTLASS power profiles asso-\nciated with runs A and B have greater skewnesses, close to\n0.5 and 0.6. The threshold widths of the three backscatter\npower distributions are within a range gate of each other,\nwith those corresponding to runs B and C being 210 km and\nthat to run A being 195 km. The dotted line indicates the\nsize of the upper hybrid width. The statistical widths of the\nCUTLASS distributions are larger for faster sweep rates and\nare evenly separated by 6\u20137 km. The largest statistical\nwidth, associated with data from run C, is approximately\n47 km and is 15 km smaller than the statistical width of the\nvirtual beam. The kurtoses of the CUTLASS distributions\nare also evenly spaced, with comparable values between\napproximately 1.9 and 2.8. The kurtosis of the virtual beam\nresembles that of the power distribution measured during\nrun B.\n[49] FAIs produced during run C can be compared with\nthose produced during steady vertical heater transmissions\nto determine the effect of the essentially wider transmitted\nheater beam. Figure 12a displays CUTLASS backscatter\npower profiles, in decibels, corresponding to data averaged\nover the duration of run C and over four periods of 2 min\nduration each (1\u20134) when the heater transmitted vertically.\nTransmissions 1 and 2 followed immediately after run C,\nand transmissions 3 and 4 were carried out 1 h later. During\nthe first vertical transmission the CUTLASS frequency\nscanned between 18 and 19.5 MHz with a time resolution of\n1 s, as during the beam\u2010sweeping runs. Thereafter the\nCUTLASS frequency was 19.5 MHz with a time resolution\nof 6 s. The power distributions of the modeled vertical\nbeam without side lobes and the virtual beam summed\nwithout side lobes are also shown in Figure 12a, in decibels.\nFigure 12a indicates that, on average, the patch power\nduring run C spanned a wider area and was smaller in\namplitude than that during the vertical transmissions, despite\nthe same heater power setting. The virtual beam distribution\nis much wider than the CUTLASS power profile associated\nwith run C, while the modeled vertical beam distribution is\ncomparable with the CUTLASS power profiles associated\nwith the vertical transmissions.\n[50] Figures 12b\u201312f show the values of the statistical\nparameters of the mean linear backscatter power distribu-\ntions, and the modeled virtual and vertically transmitted\nbeam distributions, without side lobes. The statistical width\nof the CUTLASS data measured during run C is more than\n20 km greater than the widths of data measured during the\nvertical heater transmissions. The threshold width is also\ngreater. The other statistical moments take a range of values\nduring the vertical transmissions, and the corresponding\nvalues for data from run C are not notably dissimilar. The\nstatistical width of the modeled vertical beam distribution\nshows good agreement with the widths of the CUTLASS\ndata measured during the vertical transmissions. The sta-\ntistical width of the virtual beam power distribution is\nmuch larger than these and more comparable with that of\nCUTLASS data measured during run C. The skewnesses\nand the kurtoses of the two modeled distributions lie within\nthe corresponding range of values taken by the CUTLASS\npower distributions.\n7.

The\naveraged linear backscatter power distributions are plotted\nin Figure 13 together with the modeled heater beam power\ndistributions (dotted lines) as a function of range along the\nCUTLASS beam. Both sets of distributions are scaled to\nhave a common arbitrary maximum. The solid, dot\u2010dashed,\nand dotted vertical lines in Figure 13 indicate the vertical\nand magnetic field directions and the upper hybrid width\nlimits, respectively. The heater beam transmission angle is\ngiven in the top left of each panel.\n[52] The backscatter powers are smaller during positive\nheater beam transmission angles than during the equivalent\nnegatively pointed directions, and the largest backscatter\npowers were measured when the heater beam pointed close\nto the field\u2010aligned direction. Rietveld et al. [2003] also\nobserved a bias of backscatter power in the magnetic field\ndirection and relatively large EISCAT UHF electron tem-\nperature enhancements during experiments involving 8 min\nheater transmissions in the 0\u00b0, \u22126\u00b0, and \u221212\u00b0 pointing\ndirections. Rietveld et al. suggested self\u2010focusing effects to\nexplain the bias [Bernhardt and Duncan, 1982] whereby the\nheater beam rays are refracted by the field\u2010aligned iono-\nspheric electron density depletions, resulting in higher\nheater powers in this direction.\n[53] In Figure 13, between \u0001 = 30\u00b0 and 25\u00b0, irregularities\nare present near the magnetic field direction but not in the\nvicinity of the main heater beam. These are observed to\ndecay, although not completely, and correspond to irregu-\nlarities positioned at approximately \u221230 km in Figure 4.\nSince decay of FAIs can take up to a few minutes [e.g.,\nBond, 1997; Robinson et al., 1998], while the time for each\nheater beam sweep is only 1 min, these irregularities are\nlikely to be a residual effect of the previous sweep. It is also\npossible, however, that the irregularities are a result of\npower transmitted through side lobes of the heater beam. It\nwould therefore be of benefit to repeat the experiment with a\ndelay between sweeps in order to allow the irregularities to\ndecay completely and determine whether the side lobes of\nthe heater beam are exciting the irregularities near the\nmagnetic field direction.\n[54] At \u0001 = 24\u00b0 in Figure 13 irregularities begin to appear\njust within the upper hybrid width limit, as the main heater\nbeam enters this area, while those present in the magnetic\nfield direction remain, producing a double\u2010peaked back-\nscatter power distribution. Between \u0001 = 24\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 the\npatch of irregularities in the vicinity of the main heater beam\ngrows as more of the main beam enters the upper hybrid\nwidth region. The irregularities in the magnetic field direc-\ntion continue to decay, and the patch remains almost com-\npletely within the upper hybrid width limits. Between \u0001 =\n14\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 the two sets of irregularities merge as it appears\nthe decaying irregularities become reexcited by the heater\nbeam. Between \u0001 = 6\u00b0 and \u221217\u00b0 (southward) the patch\nmoves toward more negative ranges as the heater beam\ntraverses the region within the upper hybrid width limits.\nBeyond a transmission angle of \u221217\u00b0 the irregularities begin\nto decay as the beam leaves the upper hybrid width region.\nAgain, the patch does not extend very far beyond the upper\nhybrid width limit. Figure 13 provides compelling evidence\nin support of the upper hybrid model of FAI excitation\nsince, despite the significant powers when the heater beam is\npointed at large angular displacements from vertical, FAIs\nare not excited outside of the upper hybrid width limits. A\nfurther point to note is that as the heater beam sweeps\nthrough the local meridian plane it moves obliquely through\nthe CUTLASS beam, as indicated in Figure 2. The\nCUTLASS beam is oriented at approximately 27.5\u00b0 to the\nmeridian plane; however, the modeled CUTLASS beam\nwidth is sufficiently large so as not to affect the visibility of\nany irregularities that would be produced at the extremes of\nthe heater sweep. Thus the absence of irregularities observed\nat these extreme positions is still most likely to be because\nof the upper hybrid limitations described above.\n[55] Figure 14 displays the data from Figure 13 in a form\nsimilar to Figure 4 but with the heater beam pointing\ndirection along the abscissa rather than the time. The solid,\ndashed, dot\u2010dashed, and dotted lines in Figure 14 indicate\nthe position vertically above the heater and the positions of\nthe peaks of the modeled heater beam power distributions, the\nmagnetic field direction, and the upper hybrid width limits,\nrespectively. Since the heater transmits symmetrically either\nside of vertical, it is expected that the patches should be\npositioned symmetrically about 0 km, as observed here, and\nagain the placement of the patch within the upper hybrid\nwidth limits is evident. The larger powers measured during\nnegative heater beam transmission angles are also visible. It\nis clear that the aforementioned double\u2010peaked structure is\nlikely to be caused by the presence of irregularities from the\npreceding sweep close to \u221230 km, in addition to the irregu-\nlarities created by the new sweep close to 60 km along the\nCUTLASS beam from the point vertically above the heater.\nThese persisting FAIs were identified in section 5 when we\npresented the CUTLASS RTI plots of data from the three\nbeam\u2010sweeping runs. Dhillon [2001] suggested that the\npersistence of the irregularities may have been caused by\neither a wide heater beam that constantly transmitted high\npowers in the central area, even when pointed far from this\ndirection, or a significantly higher power in the center of the\nvertically pointed heater beam such that this region received\na greater heater power than all others, leading to a greater\nFAI amplitude. It appears here, however, that the higher\u2010\npowered regions are not positioned centrally but lie close to\nthe magnetic field direction. It has already been established\nthat irregularities tend to be of a higher power in the magnetic\nfield direction. As mentioned, decay of FAIs can take up to a\nfew minutes, and, therefore, these persisting irregularities\nmay be decaying and taking longer to decay than others\nbecause of their initial high amplitude.\n[56] Figure 15 displays the statistical parameters of the\nbackscatter power data in Figure 14. Dotted lines in\nFigure 15 indicate the statistical moments of the modeled\nheater beam power distributions without side lobes at U, as\nFigure 10.

The dotted\nlines indicate the mean values of these parameters, and the statistical moments of the power distribution in Figure 9b are\nshown in green.

As mentioned in section 6.3.1,\nFigure 7 demonstrates that during the earlier sweeps of the\nrun the patch power peaked close to where the heater beam\npointed vertically, but the peak occurred at more negative\nbeam pointing directions toward the end of the run. This\nappears to be a result of the amplitude of irregularities\nmeasured during each sweep being affected by the decaying\nirregularities from the preceding sweep. Figure 4 (top)\nshows a high amplitude at ranges close to \u221230 km\nthroughout the beam\u2010sweeping run. In the time taken for\neach sweep to occur, the FAIs do not completely decay at\nthis range, causing the amplitude here to constantly increase.\nThis cumulative effect could explain the observations of a\nchanging position of the maximum summed power such that\na maximum occurs at a negative pointing direction after\naveraging.\n[58] The mean patch position, shown in Figure 15b,\nsteadily changes from slightly positive to negative values\nas the heater beam pointing direction changes. The mean\nposition of the modeled heater beam power distributions\nvaries between \u00b1100 km (Figure 6b), while the mean patch\nposition varies between only +20 and \u221250 km. The extent of\nthe patch is therefore considerably less than that of the\nmodeled beam, and this may be due to the width limit at the\nupper hybrid height. Figure 5 indicates that the main heater\nbeam lies completely outside of the upper hybrid width\nlimits once the angular displacement is greater than 25\u00b0. The\nbeam should therefore be unable to generate FAIs at U for\nthe first and last 5 s of each sweep, while the angular dis-\nplacement lies between 25\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. Figure 14 shows that\nrelatively high\u2010powered irregularities were produced only\nonce a considerable part of the main beam had entered the\nupper hybrid width region, just before the heater beam\npointed at +20\u00b0. The position of these FAIs is just inside the\nupper hybrid width region, providing strong evidence of its\nlimiting effect. Irregularities are present at the latter ends of\nthe sweeps, beyond a \u221220\u00b0 beam pointing direction, possibly\nbecause these are formed closer to the magnetic field\nFigure 13. CUTLASS backscatter power data measured during beam\u2010sweeping run A, averaged over the heater beam\npointing direction. The sequence of plots represents the change in backscatter power with time as the heater beam direction\nchanges. The solid and dot\u2010dashed lines indicate the vertical and magnetic field directions, respectively, and the dotted lines\nindicate the upper hybrid width limits. The heater beam pointing direction, \u0001, is given in the top left of each frame, and the\nmodeled heater beam power distributions are shown using dotted lines.\nFigure 14.

These irregularities would have a higher power\ndue to heater beam focusing and take longer to decay.\nHowever, again, the FAIs do not extend very far beyond the\nupper hybrid width limit.\n[59] The minimum mean patch position has a larger\nmagnitude than the maximum mean patch position, unlike\nthe mean position of the modeled beam, the extent of which\nis symmetrical about 0. Again, it may be that in the negative\nFigure 15.

The horizontal line in Figure 15c\nindicates the size of the upper hybrid width, and the dotted lines indicate the statistical moments and 3 dB\nwidth of the modeled heater beam power distributions at hU without side lobes.\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n24 of 27\nbeam pointing directions the heater beam power was\nfocused by the irregularities aligned along the magnetic field\ndirection. The corresponding larger powers would produce\nthe negatively biased mean patch position.\n[60] The maximum mean patch position occurs at \u0001 = 15\u00b0\nrather than at the start of the sweep. Such a large delay was\nnot observed during the first sweep in Figure 12, where the\nmaximum mean position occurred 5 s after the beginning of\nthe sweep, at \u0001 = 25\u00b0. The delay, therefore, could be\nattributed to the time required for the decay of irregularities\nformed in the negative beam pointing direction. This causes\nthe mean position to be less positive than expected at the\nstart of each sweep except the first.\n[61] The threshold width of the FAIs, shown in Figure 15c,\ndecreases from 200 km and then remains approximately\nconstant at around 150 km, close to the 130 km upper hybrid\nwidth. The 3 dB width of the modeled heater beam, also\nplotted in Figure 15c, increases for greater angular dis-\nplacements from vertical, but, as mentioned, the small 10 km\nchange would not have been resolved by the CUTLASS\nradar. As the angular displacement of the beam from vertical\nincreases, larger areas of the main beam lie outside of the\nupper hybrid width limits, as observed in Figure 5. The\nthreshold width of the patch remained predominantly con-\nstant during the sweeps. One possible explanation of this is\nthat the side lobes of the beam within the upper hybrid width\nwere sufficiently powerful to sustain the irregularities. It is\napparent from Figure 4 that the limits of the upper hybrid\nwidth, displayed as dashed lines, signify very well the extent\nof the patch in both directions. The solid lines in Figure 4\nindicate the extent to which the heater rays within the\n3 dB width of the main beam were able to reach according\nto the heater beam model. Since the patch of FAIs did not\nextend out to this distance, it is apparent that the width of the\npatch was limited. The threshold width of the patch is\nconsiderably larger than the 3 dB width of the modeled\nheater beam, implying the beam is able to generate FAIs\nwith power from outside of its 3 dB width. The extent of the\nswept region indicated in Figure 4 is therefore actually\ngreater than that shown.\n[62] The statistical width of the patch of FAIs, plotted in\nFigure 15d, rapidly increases from 20 to 40 km before\ndecreasing to a steady value of approximately 20 km as the\nheater beam pointing direction approaches vertical. Between\ntransmission angles of +30\u00b0 and +25\u00b0 it appears that irreg-\nularities remaining from the preceding sweep dominate with\na relatively small statistical width, which grows as they\ndecay and become less structured. New irregularities form at\nmore positive ranges once the main beam of the heater\nenters the upper hybrid width region. The double\u2010peaked\npower distribution identified in Figures 13 and 14 and\ncaused by the presence of both decaying and newly formed\nirregularities is responsible for the relatively large statistical\nwidth between heater beam transmission angles of +25\u00b0 and\n+10\u00b0. As the beam is pointed closer to the vertical direction,\nthis effect decreases and the statistical width of the patch\nsteadies to 20 km as the backscatter power profile becomes a\nsingle\u2010peaked distribution, either via complete decay or\nthrough reexcitation of decaying irregularities. As previously\nmentioned, Figure 13 shows some evidence of reexcitation\nof decaying irregularities between \u0001 = 14\u00b0 and 6\u00b0. If\nreexcitation does occur, the resulting change in patch power\nis relatively small since there is no obvious increase at \u0001 =\n14\u00b0 in Figure 15a. The steady statistical patch width of\n20 km matches that of the modeled beam at U without side\nlobes, as also plotted in Figure 15d.\n[63] The decreasing patch skewness observed at the\nbeginning of the sweep in Figure 15e is associated with the\ndecay of FAIs close to \u221230 km in Figure 14 and the growth\nof new FAIs close to the 60 km range. Between transmission\nangles of +10\u00b0 (northward) and \u221220\u00b0 (southward) the patch\nskewness increases from \u22121 to +1 as the position of the\nnewly formed FAIs gradually shifts from +15 km to\n\u221275 km, as observed in Figure 14, due to the southward\nmovement of the beam. Between \u0001 = \u221220\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 the\nskewness of the patch decreases and approaches zero. In\nFigure 14 a shift in range of the FAIs due to the motion of\nthe beam is not observed between these transmission angles.\nThis may be due to the self\u2010focusing of the beam power that\nhas been suggested and the consequent slower decay of high\npower FAIs in this direction, close to the magnetic field. The\npatch becomes more symmetrical during this time, and the\nskewness decreases toward zero. The values of patch\nskewness throughout the sweep are comparable to the\nskewness of the modeled beam distributions, although the\nchange in patch skewness as the sweep progresses does not\nmatch that of the heater beam.\n[64] Between transmission angles of \u00b130\u00b0, the patch\nkurtosis displayed in Figure 15f first decreases as new FAIs\nare established alongside decaying ones, producing a rela-\ntively wide and flat power distribution, as observed between\n\u0001 = 25\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 in Figure 13. It then increases as the new\nirregularities begin to dominate, resulting in the sharpest\npower profile with the largest value of kurtosis when the\nheater beam points in the magnetic field direction. Between\n\u0001 = \u221212\u00b0 and \u221230\u00b0 the kurtosis decreases. Apart from the\ndiscrepancy close to the magnetic field direction and at the\nbeginning of the sweep when two sets of irregularities are\npresent, the kurtosis of the patch is comparable to that of the\nmodeled beam.\n[65] Figure 10 displays excellent agreement between the\nmean values of skewness and kurtosis of the patch of FAIs\ncreated during run C (dotted lines) and of the effective\ntransmitted heater beam power of Figure 9b (green). The\nskewness of the beam power distribution is zero since there\nare equal heater transmissions on either side of the vertical\npointing direction. The skewness of the patch changes from\nslightly negative to slightly positive during the course of the\nbeam\u2010sweeping run, and this trend might be due to the\nobserved bias for irregularities to form in the direction of\nthe magnetic field since a distribution with higher power\nhere and lower powers elsewhere within the upper hybrid\nwidth limits would have a negative skewness. The negative\nrather than zero mean patch position is a consequence of the\nbias of power at negative ranges, as observed in Figure 4. As\nwith the data from run A, which also have a mean patch\nposition more negative than expected, this asymmetry may\nbe due to the self\u2010focusing of the heater beam power,\nresulting in more powerful striations close to the magnetic\nfield direction. A restriction on the patch extent by the upper\nhybrid width limits could explain the statistical width of the\npatch being lower than that of the virtual beam. Figures 11a\nand 12a demonstrate that the 3 dB points of the virtual beam\npower distribution are positioned outside of the upper hybrid\nSHERGILL ET AL.: EISCAT HEATER BEAM\u2010SWEEPING EXPERIMENTS A05307A05307\n25 of 27\nwidth, so a smaller statistical width is expected for the FAIs\nexcited by the beam.\n[66] Finally, a dip in the backscatter power profile asso-\nciated with run C is observed in the vertical direction in\nFigures 11a and 12a. It is possible that this dip is due to a\npenetration of the heater beam rays in the region of highest\nbackscatter power. If the electron density in the ionosphere\nis greatly altered by heating such that the plasma frequency\nin this region decreases to sufficiently below the heater\nfrequency and irregularity excitation does not occur, then\nthe amplitude of FAIs is likely to be lower than that of the\nsurrounding regions [Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974].\n8. Summary and Conclusions\n[67] Backscatter power profiles measured by the CUTLASS\nFinland radar during fast and slow heater beam\u2010sweeping\nexperiments at the EISCAT facility have been statistically\nanalyzed. The backscatter data correspond to patches of\nsmall\u2010scale, artificial, field\u2010aligned electron density irregu-\nlarities enhanced by the EISCAT heater. Threshold widths\nof the CUTLASS backscatter power profiles have been\ncompared to a simple model of the geometrical size of the\nheated region at the upper hybrid height, and the statistical\nmoments (summed power, mean position, statistical width,\nskewness, and kurtosis) of the power profiles have been\ncompared to those of modeled heater beam power dis-\ntributions provided by the EZNEC version 4 software. Data\nfrom the EISCAT UHF radar and the EISCAT Troms\u00f8\ndynasonde have been used to determine the upper hybrid\nheight and peak ionospheric plasma frequency during the\nheating experiments, respectively.\n[68] The dependence of the statistical parameters of the\nCUTLASS backscatter power profiles on different heater\nbeam pointing directions was investigated. The statistical\nparameters of CUTLASS backscatter power profiles mea-\nsured during heater beam sweeping were compared to those\nmeasured during static vertical transmissions. Of the three\nbeam\u2010sweeping runs, the patch created during the fastest run\nmost resembled a patch produced by a static vertical heater\ntransmission. Apart from the statistical width, the statistical\nmoments of these were found to agree, indicating the\nresemblance between a fast heater beam sweep and a static\nvertical transmission.\n[69] The highest backscatter powers were measured in the\ndirection of Earth\u2019s magnetic field despite the heater trans-\nmitting symmetrically either side of vertical. This bias is\nattributed to a focusing of the heater beam rays by the\nelectron density depletion along the magnetic field, as also\nsuggested by Rietveld et al. [2003] after observing similar\neffects.\n[70] Good agreement between the statistical moments of\nthe patches and the modeled heater beam power distribu-\ntions without side lobes has been observed. This is the case\nduring the second half of the slowest beam\u2010sweeping run,\nwhen the irregularities from the first half of the run have\ndecayed. During the fastest beam\u2010sweeping run, a virtual\nmodeled beam power distribution was used, created from a\nsuperposition of individual heater beam power distributions\nassociated with different beam pointing directions. Here\nagain there was an agreement between the statistical\nmoments of the patch power distribution and the modeled\nheater beam power distribution. The statistical width of the\nvirtual beam was larger than that of the patch created during\nthe fastest beam sweeps, however, which is thought to be\nlimited by the upper hybrid width.\n[71] Statistical results indicate that the heater beam side\nlobes are able to sustain excited irregularities if not cause\nenhancement themselves. The largest change in the statis-\ntical moments of the heater beam power distributions upon\nside lobes removal is observed in the kurtoses. It is possible\nfor multiple peaks in the power distribution within a patch of\nirregularities to combine into a single peak, as observed\nduring the slowest beam\u2010sweeping runs. Therefore, it may\nbe that the statistical moments of the patches match those of\neither the whole heater beam or the main beam or, more\nreasonably, values between the two.\n[72] As expected, comparisons of the modeled heater\nbeam power distributions with CUTLASS backscatter\npower distributions indicate that the heater beam has a large\ninfluence on the patches of irregularities. However, the\nanalysis of CUTLASS Finland backscatter power profiles\nduring beam\u2010sweeping experiments has provided strong\nevidence in favor of the upper hybrid theory of irregularity\ngeneration. The theory was tested by considering the effects\nof moving the heater beam outside of the upper hybrid width\nlimits. No irregularity excitation was observed outside of the\nupper hybrid width limits.\n[73] Many patches of irregularities excited by the EISCAT\nheater display a bias of power in the direction of Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field. This may be due to focusing of the heater\nbeam, the time scale for which is a few tens of seconds.\nBackscatter power profiles corresponding to relatively slow\nbeam\u2010sweeping experiments were observed to display a\nlarger bias of power in the direction of the magnetic field,\nindicating the effect of an instability requiring some tens of\nseconds to become established. Therefore, it is likely that\nthe observed bias of power in the magnetic field direction\nwithin patches of irregularities is due to self\u2010focusing of the\nheater beam power by the field\u2010aligned irregularities.\n[74] Ideally it would be possible to make comparisons\nwith a number of additional beam\u2010sweeping experiments;\nhowever, there are no data available for this. It is hoped that\nexperiments carried out at the EISCAT heater in the future\nmay include some that are influenced by the results and\ndiscussion presented in this paper.\n[75] Acknowledgments.
