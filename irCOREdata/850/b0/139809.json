ASM2d was chosen as biological process model to account for 12 \nthe presence of phosphate accumulating organisms. A tracer test was carried out to 13 \ndetermine the hydraulic behaviour of the plant. To realistically simulate the aeration demand, 14 \na dedicated aeration model was used incorporating the dependency of the oxygen transfer 15 \non the mixed liquor concentration and allowing differentiation between coarse and fine 16 \nbubble aeration, both typically present in MBRs. A steady-state and dynamic calibration was 17 \nperformed, and the calibrated model was able to predict effluent nutrient concentrations and 18 \nMLSS concentrations accurately. A scenario analysis (SCA) was carried out using the 19 \ncalibrated model to simulate the effect of varying SRT, recirculation ratio and DO set point on 20 \neffluent quality, MLSS concentrations and aeration demand. Linking the model output with 21 \nempirically derived correlations for energy consumption allowed an accurate prediction of the 22 \nenergy consumption. The SCA results showed that decreasing membrane aeration and SRT 23 \nwere most beneficial towards total energy consumption, while increasing the recirculation 24 \nflow led to improved TN removal but at the same time also deterioration in TP removal. A 25 \nvalidation of the model was performed by effectively applying better operational parameters 26 \nto the plant. This resulted in a reduction in energy consumption by 23% without 27 \ncompromising effluent quality, as was accurately predicted by the model.

For applications at small community level, small MBRs are 94 \nrequired (Fletcher et al., 2007; Gnirrs et al., 2008, Abegglen et al.,2008), which are then 95 \ninherently less energetically efficient due to wide variations in flows and commensurately 96 \nlarge peak loading factors demanding more conservative design. Given that the energy 97 \ndemand contributes significantly to the running costs, it is important to optimise process 98 \nenergy consumption to make the technology more competitive (Judd, 2006). 99 \n 100 \nMathematical models are widely recognized as providing a useful tool for optimising 101 \nbiological treatment, and several semi-empirical models for the optimisation of MBRs are 102 \ndescribed in literature (Verrecht et al., 2008; Wen et al., 1999; Yoon et al., 2004). These 103 \nmodels, however, have limited predictive power regarding biological performance and total 104 \nenergy demand under dynamic conditions, or else focus mainly on sludge production. The 105 \nactivated sludge models (ASMs) by Henze et al. (2000), created with the purpose of 106 \ndescribing the biological dynamics of conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems, have 107 \nbeen successfully used in the past to optimise full scale CAS plants (Dochain and 108 \nVanrolleghem, 2001). However, literature on the application of the activated sludge models 109 \nto full scale MBR is scarce or not readily accessible (Erftverband, 2001; Erftverband, 2004), 110 \nand research focuses mainly on sludge production through application of ASM1 and ASM3 to 111 \nlab and pilot scale MBR (Sperandio and Espinosa, 2008; Lubello et al., 2009). The 112 \nrequirement for full scale validation of the ASM models for MBR applications has recently 113 \nbeen identified as an urgent research need (Fenu et al., 2010). Applying these ASM to MBRs 114 \ndemands that the differences between MBR and CAS systems be recognised, viz.: a) 115 \nmicrobiological composition, leading to different stoichiometric and kinetic parameters (inter 116 \nalia Wen et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2005; Lobos et al., 2005), b) biomass concentration, 117 \nleading to changes in oxygen transfer and uptake (Krampe and Krauth, 2003; Germain et al, 118 \n2007), and c) requirement for additional aeration for membrane scouring (Judd, 2006). 119 \n 120 \nIn this paper, the application of ASM2d to a small community-scale MBR for reuse has been 121 \nappraised with the key objective of optimising energy demand without compromising nutrient 122 \nremoval. The study uses the BIOMATH calibration protocol (Vanrolleghem et al., 2003), 123 \nproceeding through a hydraulic characterisation of the system and employing both steady 124 \nstate and dynamic model calibration to predict water quality. The paper thus provides a case 125 \nstudy of the calibration and application of ASM2d to a community-scale MBR. The MBR 126 \nmodel incorporates an aeration model accounting for oxygen mass transfer at the operational 127 \nbiomass concentration and differentiates between coarse and fine bubble aeration. Energy 128 \nconsumption values for the different unit processes are derived empirically. A scenario 129 \nanalysis is conducted to link the predicted biological performance for different operational 130 \nparameters with the empirically derived energy consumption values. The scenario analysis 131 \nthus allows identification of better operational parameters, and the predicted energy saving 132 \nand biological removal performance are verified on the full scale plant. 133 \n  134 \n2 Materials and Methods 135 \n2.1 Plant description 136 \nThe wastewater recycling plant produces an average reclaimed water flow of 25 m3.d-1 for 137 \ntoilet flushing and irrigation (Figure 1). Domestic wastewater from the residences is collected 138 \nvia a pumping station and septic tanks, which provide buffering volume and primary settling. 139 \nInfluent from the septic tanks flows through 3 mm screens to the MBR, which contains both 140 \nanoxic and aerobic zones for nitrification and denitrification respectively (Table 1). Although 141 \nno anaerobic tank is provided, some of the influent phosphorous is biologically removed, 142 \nsuggesting that part of the anoxic tank may be (intermittently) anaerobic. The membrane 143 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4 \nseparation step is provided by 2 x 3 ZW500c (GE Zenon, Canada) membrane modules with 144 \na total membrane surface area of 139 m2, submerged in the aerobic zone. 145 \n 146 \n2.2 Hydraulic profile 147 \nA tracer test was carried out using a 22.1 g spike of LiCl dosed into the anoxic zone, with 148 \nsamples taken from the anoxic to aerobic tank overflow weir, the effluent and the sludge 149 \nrecirculation loop every 20 to 30 minutes for the next 40 hours (corresponding to ~1.5 times 150 \nthe hydraulic residence time, HRT). Samples were analysed for Li by atomic emission 151 \nspectroscopy at 670.784 nm (iCAP 6500 Dual View; Thermo Scientific). To validate the 152 \nresults and determine the number of tanks in series according to the tanks-in-series model 153 \n(Levenspiel, 1998), the MBR was implemented (Figure 1) as an anoxic tank followed by an 154 \nMBR unit (aerated tank with submerged membrane modules) in the modelling and simulation 155 \nplatform WEST\u00ae (MOSTforWATER N.V., Kortrijk, Belgium; Vanhooren et al., 2003). Both 156 \ntanks were assumed to be completely mixed. During the tracer test, the plant was run under 157 \nnormal flow conditions (Table 1).   158 \n 159 \n2.3 Influent characterisation 160 \nThe MBR was fed with domestic wastewater without rainwater dilution from dwellings with 161 \naverage water consumption of 80-100 l.capita-1.d-1. The wastewater strength was thus high 162 \n(Table 2), and comparable to values reported for a single household MBR by Abegglen et al. 163 \n(2008). The septic tanks were estimated to remove 20-30% of the COD, and 0-10% of the N 164 \nand P (VSA, 2005), as well as buffering the variations in influent concentration to the benefit 165 \nof biological performance (Gnirss et al., 2008). 166 \n  167 \nTable 3 compares the community wastewater characterised according to the STOWA 168 \nprotocol (Roeleveld and van Loosdrecht, 2002) to data for a typical wastewater (Henze et al., 169 \n1999), and indicates this wastewater to be 48%, 324% and 81% higher in concentrations of 170 \ntotal COD, TKN and TP respectively. The relative quantity of readily biodegradable 171 \nsubstrates (SF and SA) is also higher due to hydrolysis in the septic tanks (Zaveri and Flora, 172 \n2002), which enhances bio-P removal for which the presence of fermentation products such 173 \nas acetate (SA) is required (Henze et al, 1999; Gernaey and J\u00f8rgensen, 2004). Flow variation 174 \nwas between 0 and 1.8 m3.hr-1, with substantially larger loads (up to 25%) over the weekend 175 \n(Figure 2). 176 \n 177 \n2.4 Steady state and dynamic plant modelling using ASM2d 178 \nFor the steady state and dynamic simulations of the plant, ASM2d was chosen as the bio-179 \nchemical model since it includes enhanced biological P removal in addition to COD and N 180 \nremoval (Henze et al., 1999). To obtain better representation of P removal, the ASM2d 181 \nbiomass decay rates modifications proposed by Gernaey and J\u00f8rgensen (2004) were 182 \nadopted.   183 \n 184 \nFor the model calibration, influent, mixed liquor and effluent data was taken collected from 185 \nJanuary till May 2009, totalling 93 days, which corresponds to approximately twice the SRT 186 \n(47 days). A steady-state calibration of the full model was performed based on average data 187 \nover this period (Table 2), and a DO set point of 2 mg.l-1 was used, reflecting the average DO 188 \nvalue in the aerobic zone. For the dynamic calibration, a high frequency measurement 189 \ncampaign was carried out, and an influent file was produced through analysis of SCADA 190 \ndata, containing a data recorded every 15 minutes for 93 days for the following parameters: 191 \ninfluent flow, influent COD, CODf, BOD5, TSS, NH4-N, TKN, PO4-P, TP, recirculation flow, 192 \nDO value and wastage flow. During the sampling period, the temperature ranged from 15.8 193 \nto 20.7 \u00b0C. A number of process upsets occurred ove r this period, such as a mixer failure, 194 \nresulting in a necessary manual increase in the recirculation flow to keep the anoxic zone 195 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n5 \nmixed and a blower failure resulting in low DO levels for a number of days. These upsets 196 \nwere included in the model.   197 \n 198 \nSince the model predictions were used for energy consumption calculations, the use of an 199 \nadequate aeration model was of utmost importance. Basic aeration models, such as the one 200 \nused in Benchmark Simulation Model 1 (BSM1, Copp, 2002) and many ASM model 201 \napplications do not account for the detrimental effect of elevated MLSS concentrations on 202 \noxygen transfer, and control the oxygen transfer rate by controlling the oxygen transfer 203 \ncoefficient kLa: 204 \n( ) VDODOakSOTR satL \u22c5\u2212\u22c5=         (1) 205 \nTo account for the effect of elevated MLSS concentrations on oxygen transfer and for other \ndependencies of oxygen transfer, e.g., the difference in oxygen transfer from coarse and fine \nbubble aeration, typical for MBR, a more extensive model as described in Maere et al. (2009) \nwas used (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003; Henze et al., 2008; Verrecht et al., 2008, Krampe and \nKrauth, 2003; Germain et al, 2007, Stenstrom and Rosso, 2008), viz: \nF\nC\nCC\nSOTRAOTR T\nssat\nkaveragersat\n\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\n\u2212\u22c5\n\u22c5=\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03d5\n\u03b2 )20(tan_ )(\n     (2) 206 \n10000\/24 airairair OyOTEQSOTR \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5= \u03c1        (3) \nMLSSe \u22c5\u2212= \u03c9\u03b1\n           (4) 207 \n \nIn this model the influence of MLSS concentration on the AOTR is accounted for through the \n\u03b1-factor (Eq. 4), and the effect of using different types of diffusers for biological and \nmembrane aeration can be incorporated by calculating the SOTR for each type of diffuser \nindividually, with appropriate values of oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) and fouling factor F. \nMore details about the aeration model can be found in Maere et al. (2009). \n 208 \n2.5 Scenario analysis 209 \nA scenario analysis (SCA) was carried out to determine the optimum operating conditions by 210 \nvarying the experimentally-adjustable degrees of freedom (DOF) that were regarded as 211 \nhaving the greatest impact on effluent quality and energy consumption: 212 \n\u2022 SRT: 9 values for the wastage rate, equally spaced between 0.1 to 2.278 m3.d-1 213 \nyielding SRT values ranging from 10 to 228.7 days 214 \n\u2022 Recirculation rate: 9 values, equally spaced between 28.8 m3.d-1 to 187.2 m3.d-1 215 \n(upper range of recirculation pump) yielding recirculation ratios to the influent flow of 216 \n1.13 to 7.78 217 \n\u2022 Dissolved oxygen set point: 5 values, equally spaced between 0.75 and 2 mg.l-1 218 \n 219 \nFor inputting to the SCA, a data set containing 35 days of influent was taken from the plant 220 \nwhen operating under normal influent conditions. The scenario analysis was duplicated using 221 \ntwo different membrane aeration rate values (84 and 42 Nm3.h-1), corresponding to the 222 \nmaximum and minimum realistic values for coarse bubble air flow (Qair,coarse), since this 223 \nparameter accounts for a large part of the total energy consumption. 224 \n 225 \nThe SCA grid, using the values described above, resulted in 486 different scenarios. The 226 \nimpact on activated sludge aeration, nutrient removal and MLSS concentration was studied. 227 \nTo calculate the energy consumption for each degree of freedom, empirical correlations for 228 \nenergy consumption of the unit processes (membrane aeration, biology aeration, 229 \nrecirculation pumping, permeate pumping and mixing) were derived from measurements on 230 \nthe plant, at an MLSS of 8,000 mg.l-1. Membrane aeration energy was 0.029 to 0.034 231 \nkWh.Nm-3 for Qair,coarse of 84 and 42 Nm3.h-1 respectively, indicating that the blower becomes 232 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n6 \nless efficient at lower air flow rates. Energy demand for the recirculation pump varied linearly 233 \nwith the flow rate, up to a maximum of 0.037 kWh.m-3 of sludge pumped. Since the activated 234 \nsludge blower for biology aeration is controlled by an on\/off controller at around 2 mgO2.l-1 (or 235 \naround the different DO set points, as described above) and runs at fixed speed when in 236 \noperation, the energy consumption per Nm3 is constant at 0.0289 kWh.(Nm3)-1. For the 237 \nscenario analysis, the mixing energy was considered constant at 4.6 kWh.d-1. Since mixing 238 \naccounts for less than 5% of the total energy demand, changes in mixing energy arising from 239 \nchanges in viscosity at different MLSS concentrations were considered negligible. The 240 \npermeate pump was constantly running at 1.8 m3.h-1 when in operation, resulting in an 241 \nenergy consumption of 0.056 kWh.m-3 of permeate. Sludge handling costs were ignored 242 \nsince these depend on site-specific sludge management strategies. 243 \n 244 \n3 Results and discussion 245 \n3.1 Hydraulic profile 246 \nFigure 3 displays measured versus predicted Li concentrations in the anoxic and aerobic 247 \nzone during the tracer test. The correlation between the measured and predicted data for 248 \nboth the anoxic and aerobic zone corroborates the assumption of perfect mixing. The 249 \nrecovery of Li, defined as the ratio of Li added to Li recovered in the effluent, determined 250 \nthrough integration of the effluent Li flux, was 87%, and would have been higher for an 251 \nextended campaign. The measured Li concentrations in the effluent were always about 7.5 \u00b1 252 \n3.5% lower than the Li concentrations measured in the recirculation sludge, suggesting some 253 \nLi adsorption onto the flocs arose but not to a significant extent. The tanks could thus each 254 \nbe considered CSTRs for the remainder of the modelling exercise.   255 \n 256 \n3.2 Model calibration 257 \n3.2.1 Steady state calibration 258 \nA steady state calibration was performed to achieve an accurate simulation of the MLSS 259 \nconcentration, this being instrumental in correctly predicting the aeration energy demand due 260 \nto its effect on oxygen transfer (via the \u03b1-factor). However, as shown in Table 4, using default 261 \nvalues as reported by Henze et al. (1999) for all stoichiometric and biokinetic parameters, 262 \nleads to an underestimation of sludge production (MLSS concentration) by about 15%, as the 263 \ngrowth of XPAO (and consequently bio-P removal) could not be simulated correctly in steady 264 \nstate. This can be attributed to the fact that anaerobic conditions, required for the growth of 265 \nXPAO, do not occur during steady state simulation, indicating the need for a dynamic 266 \ncalibration taking into account the influent variations. In steady state, a correct representation 267 \nof MLSS concentrations could only be achieved by making substantial and unrealistic 268 \nchanges to \u00b5PAO (2 d-1 vs. default value of 1 d-1), bPAO (0.1 d-1 vs. default value of 0.2 d-1) and 269 \nYPO (0.2 gP.(g COD)-1 vs. default value of 0.4 gP.(g COD)-1 (Table 4).   270 \n 271 \n3.2.2 Dynamic calibration 272 \nWhen the dynamic influent file was applied to the model, the concentration of XPAO started to 273 \nincrease without the adjustments to \u00b5PAO, bPAO and YPO that were necessary in the steady 274 \nstate calibration. Upon reaching dynamic equilibrium, MLSS concentrations were 275 \nrepresented accurately using the default parameter values as reported by Henze et al. 276 \n(1999), thereby eliminating the need to adjust \u00b5PAO, bPAO and YPO as was necessary under 277 \nsteady-state conditions.  278 \n 279 \nTo calibrate the aeration model, the measured Qair,fine (averaged over a 15 minute period) 280 \nwas used as the input for the aeration model, while Qair,coarse was fixed at 84 Nm3.h-1, to mimic 281 \nthe prevailing operational conditions during the calibration period. The values for OTEfine 282 \n(0.045 m-1),  OTEcoarse (0.015 m-1) were taken from Metcalf and Eddy (2003), the value for \u03c9 283 \n(0.084) was the mean value derived from the data of Germain et al. (2007), Krampe and 284 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n7 \nKrauth (2003), and Metcalf and Eddy (2003). Fcoarse (0.8) and Ffine (0.8) were calibrated to 285 \nclosely match the measured DO profile. Calibrating the fouling factors could be justified since 286 \nan inspection of the diffusers had shown visible fouling. Moreover, more advanced 287 \ntechniques for measuring the \u03b1-factor and OTEcoarse and OTEfine were unavailable. 288 \n  289 \nDespite the plant upsets during the evaluated period, the used parameter set allowed for a 290 \nsatisfactory reproduction of the NH4-N, NO3-N and MLSS concentration trajectories; Figure 4 291 \ncompares the simulated nitrogen removal profiles (NH4-N and NO3-N) and MLSS 292 \nconcentrations with concentrations measured during an intensive sampling period on Days 293 \n61-62 of the 93 day campaign. Predicted NH4-N concentrations were consistently slightly 294 \nhigher than the measured values (~0.25 mg.l-1 simulated vs ~0.04 mg.l-1 measured and 295 \nconfirmed by using two different analytical techniques). MBRs tend to achieve more stable 296 \nand complete nitrification than CAS systems (Munz et al., 2008), a fact that is apparently not 297 \nwell incorporated into the various CAS ASM models. Despite this shortcoming, when looking 298 \nat the total nitrogen removal, the prediction is still very accurate (Figure 4). Predicted PO4-P 299 \nconcentrations show acceptable values and dynamic behaviour (Figure 5) though 300 \nconsistently a few hours ahead of those measured. It is postulated that this is caused by the 301 \noversimplification of the actual hydraulics by the tanks-in-series concept, which may be 302 \nunable to accurately predict the occurrence of localised anaerobic zones under certain 303 \nconditions. However, a CFD model study and on-line data at different locations in the tank 304 \nwould be required to confirm this. In general it can be concluded that the calibrated model 305 \npredicts nutrient and MLSS concentrations accurately using the default values for ASM2d 306 \n(Henze et al., 1999) and its modification (Gernaey and J\u00f8rgensen, 2004), and the model 307 \nused along with the energy demand calculations in the subsequent scenario analysis. 308 \n 309 \n3.2.3 On\/off controller for aeration model for predictive Qair,fine values in energy profiling 310 \nTo lend predictive value to the model, the fine bubble aeration flow rate (Qair,fine) demanded 311 \nan extra on\/off controller, switching on aeration at DO < 1.5 mg.l-1 with Qair,fine at 90 Nm3.h-1 312 \nand switching off at DO > 2.5 mg.l-1, simulating the actual blower operation at the plant. The 313 \nintegral of the predicted Qair,fine value was within 3% difference from the actual measured 314 \nvalue when using the parameters as calibrated in Section 3.2.2, indicating that aeration 315 \ndemand could be predicted accurately through this approach. Nutrient and MLSS 316 \nconcentrations were reproduced well, with predicted values generally well within 10% of the 317 \nmeasured ones (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Any differences can be attributed to slight deviations 318 \nfrom reality using the implemented on\/off controller.  319 \n 320 \n3.3 Scenario analysis 321 \nThe evolution of biological aeration demand and maximum effluent NH4-N concentration as a 322 \nfunction of the SRT (Figure 6) demonstrates that lowering the SRT by increasing the 323 \nwastage rate has a beneficial effect on demand for Qair,fine. However, Figure 6 also shows 324 \nthat this also leads to higher maximum effluent NH4-N concentrations, indicating a trade-off 325 \nbetween minimising the aeration demand (and thus energy consumption) and achievable 326 \neffluent quality. Operation at SRTs below 23 days leads to a deterioration in nitrification, 327 \nbecause of a decrease in MLSS and autotrophs concentration, and to an increase in F\/M 328 \nratio, similar to observations by Cicek et al. (2001). Lowering the DO setpoint had a similar 329 \nbut less pronounced effect on nitrification.  330 \n 331 \nThere is a similar phenomenon regarding phosphate and nitrate (Figure 7), in that an 332 \nincrease in the recirculation ratio leads to respectively lower and higher effluent NO3-N and 333 \nPO4-P concentrations. This arises because the denitrification and bio-P removal processes 334 \ncompete for the same carbon source (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) and anaerobic conditions is 335 \nless sustainable at higher recirculation ratios. 336 \n 337 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n8 \nFigure 8 shows that a change in the SRT (through variation in wastage rate), and thus MLSS 338 \nconcentration, has a much larger impact on total aeration energy demand than changing the 339 \nrecirculation ratio. At a DO setpoint of 1.25 mg.l-1 and fixed recirculation ratio, the total fine 340 \nbubble aeration demand (Qair,fine) can change by up to 342% depending on the wastage rate, 341 \nwhile this change is limited to 44% when varying the recirculation ratio at fixed SRT and DO 342 \nset point. This confirms the importance of incorporating the MLSS dependency of the oxygen 343 \ntransfer into the aeration model. The model thus allows the operating envelope to be 344 \nidentified for meeting criteria based on energy demand and\/or specific water quality 345 \ndeterminants. 346 \n 347 \nIt is acknowledged that over the range of operating conditions studied in the SCA, the 348 \nbiological processes and kinetics may change. For instance, Sperandio and Espinosa (2008) 349 \nsuggest that at elevated SRT some of the influent XI should be considered as XS, which has 350 \nimplications on the overall sludge balance. Also, simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 351 \nmay occur at low DO set points. The model accounts for this by using oxygen half-saturation 352 \ncoefficients KO for XH and XPAO. The effect of floc size on the value of KO is still debated, the 353 \nsmall flocs of an MBR compared to those from CAS would be expected to yield lower values 354 \nfor the halfsaturation constants (inter alia Manser et al., 2005). However, no clear consensus 355 \nhas been reached on the impact of specific operational conditions on kinetics. Hence, rather 356 \nthan varying the biokinetic parameters in the model over the studied range of operational 357 \nparameters, all biokinetic parameters were assumed constant, and an a posteriori model 358 \nvalidation carried out by confronting the obtained model predictions of the scenario analysis 359 \nwith experimental data independent of the calibration data set (Section 3.4). 360 \n 361 \nThe outcomes of the scenario analysis were linked with the empirical energy consumption 362 \ncalculations, and ranked in terms of energy consumption while compliant with effluent quality 363 \nstandards of <0.5 mg.l-1 NH4-N, <20 mg.l-1 TN < 20 mg.l-1, and 5,000 mg.l-1 minimum MLSS. 364 \nSince reuse regulations - such as the US EPA guidelines for unrestricted urban reuse (EPA, 365 \n2004) - generally do not include stringent NH4-N or TN guidelines, these parameters were 366 \nchosen to achieve consistent effluent quality under conservative operating conditions that 367 \ncould be achieved in a real system.  368 \n 369 \nWhen comparing the different parameter sets for the two studied air flow rates displayed, the 370 \naverage energy consumption was 13.1 \u00b1 4.7% lower at a membrane coarse bubble aeration 371 \nof 42 Nm3.h-1 compared to 84 Nm3.h-1. The maximum difference in energy consumption 372 \nbetween simulations for the different membrane airflow values was 28%, while the minimum 373 \nwas 4.6%. When the membrane aeration airflow rate was set at 42 Nm3.h-1, the minimum and 374 \nmaximum predicted energy consumption was 2.25 kWh.m-3 and 3.83 kWh.m-3 respectively. 375 \nThese values increased to 2.74 kWh.m-3 and 4.46 kWh.m-3 when the membrane aeration was 376 \nkept at its original value of 84 Nm3.h-1. 377 \n 378 \n3.4 Model application for optimisation 379 \nResults from the scenario analysis were used in the selection of better operational parameter 380 \nvalues (Table 5). The higher wastage rate (and lower SRT) resulted in a modest decline in 381 \nMLSS and higher F\/M ratio, which previous studies have indicated may increase the sludge 382 \nfouling propensity (Trussell et al., 2006). However, data collected on the real MBR over a 383 \nperiod corresponding to approximately twice the SRT indicated permeability to be maintained 384 \nat the levels achieved in the original without changing the cleaning regime, notwithstanding 385 \nthe reduction in membrane aeration rate. This is attributable to the low operational fluxes (10-386 \n13 l.m-2.h-1), well below the operating flux values for most large-scale MBRs. However, the 387 \nlower membrane aeration set point corresponded to a SADm of 0.3 Nm3.m-2.h-1, which is still 388 \nwithin the range of SADm values (0.2 \u2013 1.28 Nm3.m-2.h-1) typically considered sufficient for 389 \nsustainable operation, even at higher fluxes (Judd, 2006). Changing the parameter values 390 \ndid not compromise the effluent quality in terms of COD and N removal based on data 391 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n9 \nobtained through twice weekly grab sampling, but biological P removal deteriorated due to 392 \nthe increased recirculation ratio, as predicted by the model.  393 \n 394 \nTable 5 also displays the resulting energy saving compared to the original values. A 395 \nsubstantial reduction in energy consumption per m3 of permeate produced was achieved 396 \n(23%), and this value was predicted by the model within 5-10%. The energy consumption 397 \nvalue of 3.11 kWh.m-3 is at the lower end of values typically reported for small MBRs (Boehler 398 \net al., 2007; Gnirss et al., 2008), which can range from 3 to 12 kWh.m-3 depending on the 399 \ndesign and circumstances. However, this value is high when compared to larger, more 400 \nefficient plants, which can be as low as 0.62 kWh.m-3 for standard intermittent aeration 401 \n(Garc\u00e9s et al., 2007). Other reported values for large-scale MBRs range from 0.6 to 2.0 402 \nkWh.m-3, depending on operational parameters and flow conditions (Brepols et al., 2009).  403 \n 404 \nThe proposed modelling approach can be readily applied to other MBRs, even when 405 \noperating under more stringent conditions, which is likely for larger scale plants, since it is 406 \nwidely reported that MBRs achieve good and consistent nutrient removal at lower HRT (inter 407 \nalia Judd, 2006). However, operation at high HRTs is not uncommon for smaller plants, as 408 \nindicated in Gnirss et al. (2008), and the findings of this paper may thus provide useful 409 \ninformation for future design and operation of small scale installations. The extent of the 410 \nreduction in energy consumption that can be achieved by applying the proposed 411 \nmethodology will depend on the influent wastewater composition, desired effluent quality, 412 \nallowable MLSS range and SRT, and initial operating conditions. 413 \n 414 \n4 Conclusions 415 \n\u2022 A small MBR for domestic water recycling, running under unusual and challenging 416 \ninfluent conditions, was dynamically modelled in ASM2d. The model provided an 417 \naccurate prediction of the dynamic nutrient removal profile and MLSS concentrations 418 \nusing default ASM2d values for all biokinetic and stoichiometric parameters.  419 \n\u2022 A dedicated aeration model was used, incorporating the effect of elevated MLSS 420 \nconcentrations on oxygen transfer, and allowing differentiation between coarse and 421 \nfine bubble aeration such that aeration demand could be accurately simulated. 422 \n\u2022 To allow realistic modelling of the plant, influent fractionation was carried out based 423 \non average influent concentrations obtained over a four-month sampling period. 424 \nAnalysis has shown the wastewater strength to be considerably higher than for a 425 \ntypical wastewater of entirely domestic origin with no dilution or infiltration. The 426 \namount of readily biodegradable substrate (45%) was also higher than typically 427 \nreported values (20%) due to hydrolysis in the septic tank.     428 \n\u2022 A scenario analysis was conducted to simulate the effect of varying the SRT, the 429 \nrecirculation ratio and the DO set point on effluent quality, MLSS concentrations and 430 \naeration demand. Linking the outcomes with empirically-derived calculations for 431 \nenergy consumption allowed quantification and optimisation of the energy demand. 432 \nDecreasing the membrane aeration flow and SRT had the most profound effect on 433 \ntotal operational energy consumption, but there was a trade-off in achievable NH4-N 434 \nremoval due to diminished nitrification with decreasing SRT. Increasing the 435 \nrecirculation flow led to improved TN removal and to deterioration in TP removal. This 436 \nmodelling approach thus allows the operating envelope to be identified for meeting 437 \ncriteria based on energy demand and\/or specific water quality determinants - and 438 \nnutrients in particular. 439 \n\u2022 New operational parameter values were applied to the plant, resulting in an on-site 440 \nreduction in energy consumption by 23%, without compromising effluent quality, as 441 \npredicted by the model.   442 \n 443 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n10 \nAcknowledgements 444 \nThe authors are grateful to MOSTforWATER N.V.
