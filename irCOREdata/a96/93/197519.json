It is also an essential element in assessing \nterrestrial carbon fluxes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 35 \nChange and is crucial in assessing both resources and the ecosystem services provided \nby forests. For most parts of the world, in particular the tropical forests, information on \nbiomass is currently very limited.  It is usually resolved at very coarse scales, and is \nsubject to large and unquantified errors. In response to the urgent need for improved \nmapping of global biomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of 40 \naddressing this need, the BIOMASS mission was proposed to the European Space \nAgency for the third cycle of Earth Explorer Core missions and was selected for \nFeasibility Study (Phase A) in March 2009. Over the five-year mission lifetime, it will \nmap the full range of the world\u201fs above-ground biomass with accuracy and spatial \nresolution compatible with the needs of national scale inventory and carbon flux 45 \ncalculations, and will map changes in forest biomass. The mission will carry a \npolarimetric P-Band SAR, capable of providing both direct measurements of biomass \nderived from inverting intensity data, and measurements of forest height derived from \npolarimetric interferometry. This paper describes the characteristics of the mission and \nsurveys the body of evidence built up over the last decade, from a wide range of 50 \nairborne experiments, which illustrates the ability of such a sensor to provide the \nrequired measurements. It also indicates the likely value of the mission to several other \n 3 \ngeo-science areas, including geomorphology in arid areas, ice structure and dynamics, \nand the dynamics of forest inundation. \n1. Introduction - Biomass and the global carbon cycle 55 \nOne of the most unequivocal indications of man\u201fs effect on our planet is the continual \nand accelerating growth of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. A central concern \nis the climate-change implication of increasing atmospheric CO2. The principal \ncontribution to this growth is emissions from fossil fuel burning. However, the rate of \ngrowth is substantially less and much more variable than these emissions because of a 60 \nnet flux of CO2 from the atmosphere to the Earth\u201fs surface. This net flux can be \npartitioned into atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-land components, whose mean \nvalues for the 1990s are 2.2  0.4 GtC y\n-1\n and 1.0  0.6 GtC y\n-1\n respectively \n(International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007). As in most carbon cycle \ncalculations, CO2  fluxes are reported in this paper in terms of carbon units; 1 GtC = 1 65 \nPg or10\n15\n g of carbon. \nThis simple description of the overall carbon balance conceals some major scientific \nissues, which we illustrate by Fig. 1:  \n  \n 70 \n \n \n \n \n 75 \n \nAnthropogenic\nSources\nHigh\nResidual land \nsink\nLow\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nChanges in C pools\nFossil fuel\nemissions\nLow\nLand use \nchange flux\nAtmospheric \nincrease\nNet ocean \nsink\nG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\nHigh\nG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\nG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\nLow\nigh\nLand use \nchange flux\nResidual\nland sink\nNet ocean\nsinkG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\nG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\nG\ntC\n\/y\ne\na\nr\n 4 \nFigure1. Bar chart showing the anthropogenic carbon sources and the associated \nannual net fluxes to the carbon pools for the 1990s, with units given as GtC yr\n-1\n. The \nuncertainties in the well-constrained terms (fossil fuel emissions, the atmospheric \nincrease in CO2 and the net ocean sink) are indicated by the error bars. The land use \nchange flux is poorly constrained and the chart indicates the range of estimates, from 80 \nlow to high, of this quantity. In order to achieve carbon balance, there must be take-up \nof CO2 by the land surface, and the corresponding low and high estimates of this \n\u201cresidual land sink\u201d are indicated. The data for this figure are taken from IPCC \n(2007). \n 85 \n1. Although fossil fuel emissions, the atmospheric CO2 increase and the net \natmosphere-ocean flux are well constrained by measurements (IPCC, 2007), this is not \ntrue of the atmosphere-land flux. Its value is estimated simply as the residual needed to \nclose the carbon budget after subtracting the atmospheric growth in CO2 and the net \namount transferred into the oceans from the emissions. Hence its variance is determined 90 \nindirectly as the sum of the variances of the other fluxes. \n2. Fossil fuel burning forms only part of the total anthropogenic CO2 loading of \nthe atmosphere, with another major contribution coming from land use change. The \nsize of this flux is poorly known, and is reported in IPCC (2007) simply as a range, \nshown in Fig. 1 as a low and high value about a central value of 1.6 GtC y\n-1\n. (It is worth 95 \nnoting that the lastest value put it to 1.4 GtC y\n-1\n (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2009)).  \n3. In order to balance the carbon budget, any value of land-use-change flux must \nhave an associated land uptake flux, indicated in Fig. 1 as a \u201cresidual\u201d flux, since its \nvalue is derived purely as a difference of other terms. \n 5 \nMarked on Fig. 1 are  the uncertainties in the well-constrained terms; it can be seen that 100 \nthe uncertainties in both emissions and uptake by the land dominate the overall error \nbudget. Fundamental to better quantification of these land fluxes is accurate knowledge \nabout the magnitude, spatial distribution and change of forest biomass. \nMore than 98% of the land-use-change flux is caused by tropical deforestation (IPCC, \n2007), which converts carbon stored as woody biomass (which is approximately 50% 105 \ncarbon) into emissions. The most basic methods of calculating this flux simply multiply \nthe area deforested (derived from national statistics or remote sensing) by the average \nbiomass of the deforested area, expressed in carbon units (IPCC, 2003). More complete \nmethods of carbon accounting would include carbon fluxes from the soil, differential \ndecay rates of carbon depending on how the biomass is used, and regrowth fluxes 110 \n(Houghton, 2003a, b; DeFries et al., 2002). However, both approaches are severely \ncompromised by lack of reliable information on the levels of biomass actually being \nlost in deforestation. This uncertainty alone accounts for a spread of values of about 1 \nGtC y\n-1\n in different estimates of carbon emissions due to tropical deforestation \n(Houghton, 2005). 115 \nThe residual land flux is of major significance for climate, since it reduces the build-up \nof CO2 in the atmosphere. If we assume a land use change flux of 1.6 GtC yr\n-1\n, the total \nanthropogenic flux to the atmosphere in the 1990s was 8 GtC yr\n-1\n. Of this, around \n32.5% was absorbed by the land (see Fig. 1), but this value has very large uncertainties \narising from the uncertainties in the land use change flux. The uptake is highly variable 120 \nfrom year to year, for reasons that are poorly understood. Similar trends are seen since \n2000 (Canadell et al., 2007). A key question is how much of this residual sink is due to \nfixing of carbon in forest biomass.  \n 6 \nAs a result, biomass is identified by the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC) as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) needed to reduce 125 \nuncertainties in our knowledge of the climate system (GCOS 2003; Sessa and Dolman, \n2008). Further strong impetus to improve methods for measuring global biomass comes \nfrom the Reduction of Emissions due to Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) \nmechanism, which was introduced in the UNFCCC Committee of the Parties (COP-13) \nBali Action Plan. Its implementation relies fundamentally on systems to monitor carbon 130 \nemissions due to loss of biomass from deforestation and forest degradation. \nConcerns about climate change provide a compelling reason for acquiring improved \ninformation on biomass, but biomass is also profoundly important as a source of energy \nand materials for human use. It is a major energy source in subsistence economies, \ncontributing around 9-13% of the global supply of energy (i.e. 35-55 10\n18\n Joule yr\n-1\n; 135 \nHaberl and Erb, 2006). The FAO provides the most widely used information source on \nbiomass harvest (FAO, 2001; FAO 2006), but other studies differ from the FAO \nestimates of the wood-fuel harvest and forest energy potential by a factor 2 or more \n(Whiteman et al., 2002, Smeets et al., 2007; Krausmann et al., 2008). Reducing these \nlarge uncertainties requires frequently updated information on woody biomass stocks 140 \nand their change over time, to be combined with other data on human populations and \nsocio-economic indicators.  \nBiomass and biomass change also act as indicators of other ecosystem services. Field \nstudies have shown how large-scale and rapid change in the dynamics and biomass of \ntropical forests lead to forest fragmentation and increase in the vulnerability of plants 145 \nand animals to fires (Malhi and Phillips, 2004). Bunker et al. (2005) also showed that \nabove-ground biomass was strongly related to biodiversity. Regional to global \ninformation on human impacts on biodiversity therefore requires accurate \n 7 \ndetermination of forest structure and forest degradation, especially in areas of \nfragmented forest cover. This is also fundamental for ecological conservation. The 150 \nprovision of regular, consistent, high-resolution mapping of biomass and its changes \nwould be a major step towards meeting this information need. \nDespite the obvious need for biomass information, and in contrast with most of the \nother terrestrial ECVs for which programmes are advanced or evolving, there is \ncurrently no global observation programme for biomass (Herold et al., 2007). Until 155 \nnow, the only sources of gridded global biomass (i.e. typically above-ground biomass, \nwhich is the dry weight of woody and foliar tree elements) are maps at very coarse \nspatial resolutions (1\/2 to 1 degree) based largely on ground data of unknown accuracy \n(Olson et al., 1983; Olson et al., 2001; Kindermann et al., 2008). At regional scale, \nvarious approaches have been used to produce biomass maps. Houghton et al. (2003) 160 \ncompared seven biomass maps of the Brazilian Amazon forest produced by different \nmethods, including interpolation of in situ field measurements, modelled relationships \nbetween above-ground biomass and environmental parameters, and the use of optical \nsatellite data to guide biomass estimates. In these maps, estimates of the total amount of \ncarbon in the Brazilian Amazon forests varied from 39 to 93 Gt of carbon, and the 165 \ncorrelation between the spatial distributions of biomass in the various maps was only \nslightly better than would be expected by chance (Houghton et al., 2003).  \nCurrently, there are severe limitations on the use of remote sensing to measure biomass. \nOptical data are not physically related to biomass, although estimates of biomass have \nbeen obtained from Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from optical greenness indices. 170 \nHowever, these are neither robust nor meaningful above a low value of LAI.  For \nexample, Myneni et al. (2001) used optical data from the Advanced Very High \nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors to infer biomass changes in northern forests \n 8 \nover the period 1981-1999, and concluded that Eurasia was a large sink. However, both \nfield data and vegetation models indicate that the Eurasian sink is much weaker (Beer 175 \net al., 2006). Radar measurements, resulting from the interaction of the radar waves \nwith tree scattering elements, are more physically related to biomass, but their \nsensitivity to forest biomass depends on the radar frequency. C-band (ERS, Radarsat \nand ENVISAT ASAR) backscatter in general shows little dependence on forest \nbiomass. C-band interferometric measurements do better; for example, ERS Tandem 180 \ndata were combined with JERS L-band data to generate a map of biomass up to 40-50 t \nha\n-1\n with 50 m pixels covering 800000 km\n2\n of central Siberia (Schmullius et al., 2001).   \nFrom the more recent Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) mission, launched \nby the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2006, Phased Array L-band \nSAR (PALSAR) data are being systematically collected to cover the major forest 185 \nbiomes. Recent results (http:\/\/www.ies.aber.ac.uk\/en\/subsites\/the-alos-kyoto-amp-\ncarbon-initiative) have shown PALSAR\u201fs ability to map forest (e.g. in the Amazon and \nSiberia) but retrieval of forest biomass is still typically limited to values less than 50 t \nha\n-1\n, which excludes most temperate and tropical forests. Furthermore, loss of temporal \ncoherence over the PALSAR repeat interval of 45 days prevents recovery of forest 190 \nheight by polarimetric SAR interferometry. \nIt is against this background of an urgent need for greatly improved mapping of global \nbiomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of addressing this need that \nthe BIOMASS mission was proposed to the Call for Ideas released in March 2005 by \nthe European Space Agency (ESA) for the third cycle of Earth Explorer Core missions. 195 \nBIOMASS was selected in May 2006 for Assessment Study (phase 0) and in March \n2009 for Feasibility Study (phase A). This paper identifies the issues of concern \naddressed by the mission, summarises its specific research objectives, and specifies the \n 9 \nobservational requirements within the context of the scientific objectives. Finally, a \nshort overview of the mission elements is given. 200 \n \n2. The BIOMASS mission \nThe primary scientific objectives and characteristics of the BIOMASS mission are set \nout in Table 1. It will carry a polarimetric P-Band SAR that will provide: \n Measurements of the full range of the world\u201fs above-ground biomass, by 205 \ncombining several complementary SAR measurement techniques; \n Geophysical products whose accuracy and spatial resolution are compatible \nwith the needs of national scale inventory and carbon flux calculations; \n Repeated global forest coverage, enabling mapping of forest biomass and forest \nbiomass change.  210 \nBy making these measurements over the proposed five-year mission lifetime, a unique \narchive of information about the world\u201fs forests and their dynamics will be built up, \nwhich will have lasting value well beyond the end of the mission. \nThe P-band frequency was chosen because of its unique capabilities for forest biomass \nand height measurement. Sensitivity to forest biomass and biomass change increases 215 \nwith wavelength (Le Toan et al., 1992, Dobson et al., 1992, Le Toan et al., 2004). In \naddition, longer wavelength SAR exhibits greater temporal coherence, allowing canopy \nheight to be retrieved by polarimetric interferometry; this is a crucial complement to \nmethods that recover biomass by inverting SAR intensity data. Both considerations \nstrongly support the use of P-band, since it is the longest wavelength available for 220 \nspaceborne application.  \n 10 \nThe opportunity to use P-band arose only when the International Telecommunications \nUnion (ITU) designated the frequency range 432-438 MHz as a secondary allocation to \nremote sensing at the World Radio Communications Conference in 2003 (ITU, 2004). \nThe BIOMASS SAR will therefore operate at a centre frequency of 435 MHz (i.e., a 225 \nwavelength of around 69 cm) and with a bandwidth of 6 MHz. \nTable 1: BIOMASS primary science objectives and mission requirements. \nPrimary science \nobjectives \nMeasurement \nrequirements \nInstrument requirements \n \n \n \nQuantify magnitude \nand distribution of \nforest biomass \nglobally to improve \nresource assessment, \ncarbon accounting \nand carbon models   \n \nAbove-ground forest biomass from \n70\no\n N to 56\no\n S with accuracy of \n\u00b120% (or  classes of 10 t ha\n-1\n in \nforest regrowth) at spatial scale of \n100-200 m. \n \nForest height with accuracy of \u00b14 \nm. \n \nForest mapping at spatial scales of \n100-200 m. \n \nP-band SAR (432-438 MHz) \n \nPolarimetry for biomass retrieval \nand ionospheric correction \n \nPol-InSAR capability to measure  \nforest height \n \nConstant incidence angle  (in the \nrange of 23\no\n-35\no\n) \n \n25-45 day repeat cycle for \ninterferometry \n \nDawn-dusk orbit to reduce \nionospheric effects \n \n1 dB absolute accuracy in \nintensity measurements \n \n0.5 dB relative accuracy in \nintensity measurements \n \n5 year mission lifetime \n \nMonitor and \nquantify changes in \nterrestrial forest \nbiomass globally, \nleading to improved \nestimates of:  \n(a) terrestrial carbon \nsources (primarily \nfrom deforestation) \nusing accounting \nmethods; \n(b) terrestrial carbon \nsinks due to forest \nregrowth and \nafforestation \n \n \nBiomass loss due to deforestation \nand forest degradation, annually or \nbetter, at spatial scales of 100-200 \nm. \n \nBiomass accumulation from forest \ngrowth, at spatial scale of 100-200 \nm; 1 estimate per yr in tropical \nforests, 1 estimate over 5 yrs in \nother forests. \n \nChanges in forest height caused by \ndeforestation. \n \nChanges in forest area at spatial \nscales of 100-200 m, annually or \nbetter. \n3 Forest biomass retrieval using P-band SAR \nThe various approaches to recovering forest biomass from P-band SAR data are \nsummarised in this section.  230 \n 11 \n3.1 Forest biomass retrieval using radar backscattering coefficients \nThe sensitivity of P-band SAR backscatter to forest biomass has been studied since the first \nairborne P-band systems became available in the early 1990s. Numerous airborne \ncampaigns have taken place, over a wide variety of forest biomes, including sites in \ntemperate, tropical and boreal forests. Most initial work focused on the cross-polarised 235 \nHorizontal-Vertical (HV) backscatter, which has the largest dynamic range and the highest \ncorrelation with biomass. Fig. 2 illustrates the key characteristics of the observed \nrelationship between forest biomass and the HV radar backscattering coefficient. The data \ncome from several different forest types, including temperate coniferous forest in Les \nLandes, France (Le Toan et al., 1992, Beaudoin et al., 1994); boreal forest with mixed 240 \nspecies in Alaska, USA (Rignot et al., 1994); northern temperate forest with mixed species \nin Howland, Maine, USA (Ranson et al. 1994); tropical forest in Guaviare, Colombia \n(Hoekman et al., 2000); tropical forest in La Selva, Costa Rica (Saatchi et al., 2009); and \nhemi-boreal coniferous and deciduous forest in Remningstorp, Sweden (Sandberg et al., \n2009). 245 \nThe SAR data were all acquired by the NASA-JPL AIRSAR system, except those from \nSweden, which were acquired by the E-SAR system from DLR, Germany. \n \n \n 250 \n \n \n \n \n 255 \n \n 12 \n \n \n \n 260 \n \n \n \n \n 265 \n \nFigure 2. P-band HV backscattering coefficient plotted against above-ground biomass \nfor experiments conducted at six different forests as indicated in the key. The \nbackscattering coefficient is expressed as cos\n00\nHVHV\n, where  is the incidence \nangle. The green squares with error bars indicate the mean and standard deviation of 270 \nthe data points within intervals of 10 t ha\n-1\n centred on values of biomass spaced by \n20 t ha\n-1\n, beginning from 50 t ha\n-1\n and running out to 270 t ha\n-1\n. The solid green line is \na regression curve derived from the combined data reported in the publications prior to \n2009. The dashed curves are obtained by replacing the biomass value, B, by 0.8 B and \n1.2 B in the regression equation.  275 \nFig 2 shows the HV backscattering coefficient (expressed in terms of cos\n00\nHVHV\n, \nwhere  is the incidence angle, to provide a first order correction for different \nincidence angles in the various datasets) plotted against ground-based estimates of \nbiomass. The data acquired in the 1990s were used to derive the solid green fitting \n 13 \ncurve shown in Figure 2. For the two more recent datasets (La Selva and 280 \nRemningstorp), constants of + 5 dB and - 3 dB, respectively (estimated to give the least \nroot mean square (RMS) error with the fitting curve) were added to the backscatter \nvalues to compensate for the observed offsets from the earlier datasets and attributed to \nabsolute calibration uncertainties in the airborne instruments. The dashed green curves \ndelimit the \u00b1 20% uncertainties in in situ biomass around the fitting curve, obtained by 285 \nreplacing the biomass value B by 0.8 B and 1.2 B. The green squares with error bars \nindicate the mean and standard deviation of the data points within intervals of 10 t ha\n-\n1\n centred on values of biomass spaced by 20 t ha\n-1\n, beginning from 50 t ha\n-1\n and running \nout to 270 t ha\n-1\n. \nFig. 2 indicates a remarkable consistency in the shape of the biomass-HV backscatter 290 \nrelationship over this varied set of forest biomes, despite variability in the measurements \ncaused by: (a) errors in the in situ estimates of forest biomass; (b) errors in the estimates of \nthe radar backscattering coefficient (due to speckle, calibration and geolocation errors); and \n(c) \u201cgeophysical\u201d variability due to forest characteristics (e.g., species, number density, age \nclass),  as well as  to topography, weather conditions and understorey conditions. Among 295 \nthese sources of error, the error associated to in situ biomass estimates can contribute \nsignificantly to the scatter observed in Fig. 2.  In practical forestry, the uncertainty in biomass \nestimates is usually estimated to be about ~20%, based on stand-based timber volume for even-aged \nplantation forests (Le Toan et al., 1992). However, for most forests in natural condition, the error in \nbiomass estimates can be much larger due to : (i)  the choice of allometric models relating biomass 300 \nto measured tree dimensions; (ii) the sampling uncertainty, related to the size and \nrepresentativeness of the measurement plots;  (iii) the error in wood density needed to convert \ntimber volume into biomass and iv) the exclusion of small trees (e.g. those of diameters less than 10 \ncm, 7 cm or 5 cm depending on measurement standards). In an analysis of uncertainty sources for a \ntropical forest Chave et al., 2005, found that the  uncertainty  in in situ biomass estimate is of 24% 305 \n 14 \nof the mean for measurement plot of 1 ha, and it increases reversely with the size of the \nmeasurement plot. Hence, for the general case where measurement plots are much smaller than 1 \nha, the uncertainty in in situ biomass estimates can be considered as much larger than ~25% of the \nmean.  \nIt can be seen that the HV backscatter increases by over 17 dB as biomass ranges from a few t 310 \nha-1 up to 300 t ha-1. Such a large contrast between high and low biomass areas allows major \ndisturbances, such as clear-felling of forests, to be easily detected. The sensitivity of backscatter \nto biomass is greatest at lower values of biomass, up to about 150 t ha-1, and enables the early \nyears of regrowth after disturbance to be monitored.  \nThe observed relationship between P-band backscatter and biomass has been interpreted using 315 \nelectromagnetic scattering models (Ulaby et al., 1990; Hsu et al., 1994; Fung, 1994; Ferrazzoli \net al., 1997). These studies found that HV backscatter is dominated by volume scattering from \nthe woody elements in the trees, so that HV is strongly related to the above-ground biomass. \nFor the HH and VV polarisations, ground conditions can affect the biomass-backscatter \nrelationship, because HH backscatter comes mainly from trunk-ground scattering, while VV 320 \nbackscatter results from both volume and ground scattering. At present, biomass retrieval from \nmultiple polarisations has been achieved by regression on a quadratic form, developed to \nsimplify the complex modelling formulation (Saatchi et al. 2007). The inversion requires forest \ntraining plots for model calibration and also information on topography, since HH is affected \nby ground conditions. 325 \nErrors in estimates of biomass by inverting either the HV backscatter alone or HV with other \npolarisations vary between studies, and depend on the range of biomass and the methods used to \nestimate in situ biomass. Reported RMS errors in literature (e.g. Le Toan et al., 1992, Beaudoin et \nal., 1994); Rignot et al., 1994; Ranson et al. 1994); Hoekman et al., 2000; Saatchi et al., \n2009; and Sandberg et al., 2009) fall in the range 15% to 35% of the mean biomass, with 330 \nhigher values at the test-sites with larger ranges of biomass.   \n 15 \nFig. 3 shows the biomass map for a section of the Landes forest, estimated by inverting \nthe HV backscatter, together with a scatterplot of in situ measurements of biomass for \ntwelve reference forest stands plotted against values estimated by inversion. This forest \nhas very homogenous stands with biomass in the range 0-150 t ha\n-1\n, and inverting HV 335 \nbackscatter alone yields an RMS error of less than 10 t ha\n-1\n.  For more complex forests, \ne.g. with more heterogeneity and a larger biomass range, inversion of HV intensity \nusing the empirical curve in Fig. 2 is expected to yield larger errors. This is illustrated \nby the image and scatterplot in Fig. 4 for the Remningstorp site. Comparing the mean \nbiomass at 55 reference stands with the biomass values obtained by in situ 340 \nmeasurements and derived from laser height estimates, as described in Sandberg et al. \n(2009), gives  an RMS inversion error of 47 t ha\n-1\n. \n \n \n 345 \n \n \n \n \n 350 \nFigure 3.

For example, old growth forest plots in the \nAmazon forest have biomass in the range 200-400 t ha\n-1\n (Malhi et al., 2006). However, \nthe use of polarimetry and forest vertical structure from interferometry will potentially \nimprove the biomass estimation in the so-called \u201csaturation\u201d region. This can be \nachieved by measuring forest height using a SAR technique known as polarimetric 375 \ninterferometry or Pol-InSAR (Cloude et al., 2001). A major advantage of this approach \nis that both height and biomass measurements are provided independently by the same \nBiomass  \n(t. ha \n-1\n) \n \n50\n250\n200\n150\n100\n 17 \nradar sensor. In addition, the sensitivity of Pol-InSAR to height increases with height \n(and hence biomass), whereas the sensitivity of intensity to biomass decreases with \nbiomass, so that the two measurements complement each other when used jointly in 380 \nretrieval. \n3.2.1 Measurement of forest height using Pol-InSAR \nThe key quantity measured by Pol-InSAR is the interferometric coherence, , which is \nthe modulus of the complex correlation coefficient between two images of a scene \nacquired at different times (for a repeat pass system) and with slightly different 385 \ngeometries. The coherence can be decomposed into three main contributions: \nvoltSNR\n.        (4)  \nThe noise decorrelation ( SNR ) is of secondary importance in forest observations, so the \ntwo important terms are the temporal coherence ( t ), which measures the stability of \nthe scatterers between the two acquisitions, and the volume decorrelation ( vol ). The 390 \nlatter is related to the vertical distribution of scatterers, F(z), also known as the vertical \nstructure function, where z is height, through a Fourier Transform relationship. It is \ntherefore a key observable for quantitative forest parameter estimation (Treuhaft and \nSiqueira, 2000; Askne et al., 1997; Cloude and Papathanassiou, 1998; Papathanassiou \nand Cloude, 2001), and height retrieval from Pol-InSAR is based on estimating this 395 \nquantity.  \nAn important special case of F(z) is the exponential profile which, when combined with \na delta function for the ground contribution, forms the basis for the widely-used \nRandom-Volume-over-Ground (RVoG) model (Cloude and Papathanassiou 2003). \nDespite its simplicity, this model has been successfully used to estimate forest height 400 \nfrom L- and P-band coherence in experiments in temperate forests (Papathanassiou and \n 18 \nCloude, 2001; Mette et al., 2004; Dubois-Fernandez et al., 2008; Garestier et al., 2008a, \n2008b; Garestier and Le Toan, 2009a, 2009 b), boreal forests (Praks et al., 2006; Lee at \nal., 2008) and tropical forests (Kugler et al., 2006; Kugler et al., 2007; Hajnsek et al., \n2008). Height errors in the P-band retrievals were typically found to be around 2 to 4 m.    405 \nOf great importance is that Pol-InSAR methods have been demonstrated in tropical \nforests, as illustrated by Fig. 5. This shows a height map of the Mawas region, \nIndonesia, derived from P-band data acquired during the ESA Indrex campaign in 2004, \nand a comparison between radar-derived and lidar measurements of H100 along a \ntransect crossing the site. The RMS difference between the two height measurements is 410 \n1.73 m over heights ranging from 4 to 27 m (Hajnsek et al., 2009).  \n \n \n \n 415 \n \n \n \n \n 420 \n \n \nFigure 5. Left:  Pol-InSAR height map for tropical forest at the Mawas test site, \nIndonesia, produced using data from the E-SAR system in the ESA Indrex experiment. \nHeight (m) \n 19 \nRight: Comparison between P-band Pol-InSAR height and lidar height (Hanjsek et al., 425 \n2008). \nA critical issue for repeat-pass spaceborne Pol-InSAR measurements is temporal \ndecorrelation caused by changes in the scene occurring between acquisitions. This is \nbecause Pol-InSAR interprets temporal decorrelation as volume decorrelation (see eq. \n(4)), which biases the height estimates and increases their dispersion (Lee at al., 2008). 430 \nA fundamental advantage of P-band over higher radar frequencies is that it has much \ngreater resistance to temporal decorrelation, firstly because P-band backscatter tends to \ncome from large tree elements (the trunk and big branches) which are inherently very \nstable and secondly because scatterer motions of a given magnitude have much less impact \non P band. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, which shows a simulation, based on a formulation by 435 \nZebker and Villasenor (1992), of the effect of scatterer motion on coherence as a function of \nwavelength; the range of wavelengths covered by SAR systems operating at C-, L- and P-band \nis also indicated. In this simulation, the scatterers are assumed to be the same for all frequencies \nand to suffer independent Gaussian displacements with standard deviation 1, 3 and 5 cm \nbetween acquisitions. Although an idealization, the plot clearly indicates that lower frequencies 440 \nare much less sensitive to motion-induced decorrelation. Motions of 1 cm have little effect on \nP-band coherence, and are tolerable at L-band, but destroy C-band coherence. Motions of 3 cm \nreduce the P-band coherence by around 0.1, but the L-band coherence is reduced to a level that \nmakes it unusable for height estimation. When motions grow to 5 cm, height biases at L- and P-\nband are too large for the measurements to be useful.   445 \nThese properties are highlighted by Fig. 7, which shows the height and height error obtained \nfrom the inversion of single-baseline fully polarimetric ESAR Pol-InSAR data using the RVoG \nmodel for the Remningstorp test site.  Note that this is the same scene as in Fig. 4. Fig. 7a \nshows the height map at P-band obtained from quasi-simultaneous acquisitions and is derived \nwithout using a priori information about terrain or vegetation density (Cloude & 450 \nPapathanassiou 2003, Hajnsek et al. 2009).

For example, for four common European forest species (spruce, 480 \npine, oak and beech), Mette (2007) found the relation     \nB = 0.801  H100 \n1.748\n      (3) \nWhere B is biomass in t ha \n-1\n,  H100 denotes top height in metre, defined as the mean \nheight of the 100 trees with the largest diameter in a 1 ha area. For most forests, the \nvalue of becomes more stable as the plot sizes used to estimate it become larger. This 485 \nshould apply particularly to tropical forests, where the large variability of forest \nattributes found for small plots is substantially reduced at a scale of 1 ha (Clark and \nClark 2000, Chave et al, 2001, Chave et al.,  2003, K\u00f6hler & Huth, 1998). \n 22 \nThe use of allometric equations to derive biomass from Pol-InSAR height will be \nexplored during Phase A of the mission; this will require further work to consolidate 490 \nallometric relationships for the major forest biomes. \n3.2.3 Deriving forest information from SAR tomography \nPhase 0 and Phase A include studies on the use of SAR tomography to gain information on \nthe interactions between radar waves and the forest canopies. This technique exploits multi-\nbaseline interferometric SAR observations to reconstruct the scattering from a vegetation 495 \nlayer as a function of height (Reigber and Moreira (2000), Fornaro et al. (2005), Cloude, 2006; \nTebaldini and Rocca, 2008). These measurements provide new insight into the physical \nlinks between forest biomass and P-band observables, by clarifying the main P-band \nscattering mechanisms in forest media, their relative contribution to the total radar signal, \nand their variation over different forest types. Of particular value to the BIOMASS mission 500 \nis the ability of SAR tomography to distinguish the contributions to the radar signal from \nthe forest canopy (the tree crowns) and from double-bounce scattering, since the scattering \ngeometry causes the latter to appear as a return from ground level. Using the data acquired \nat the Remningstorp forest, it was found that the relative contribution of the backscatter \nfrom ground level is largely dominant for the HH and VV polarisations (the ratio is of the 505 \norder of 10 dB), and still dominant, though moderately, at HV (of the order of 3 dB) \n(Tebaldini and Rocca, 2008, Tebaldini, 2010). Figure 8 shows the ratio between the \nbackscatter from the ground and from the canopy for HV polarisation  (the same scene as \nin figs. 4 and 7). The backscatter from the ground level was found higher than that of the \ncanopy level (corresponding to ground-to-canopy ratio >0 dB) in many of the forested 510 \nareas. This would not be expected from most current scattering models and indicates the \nneed for improved scattering models that take into account the impact of tree structure, \nunderstorey and topography. \n 23 \n \n 515 \n \n \n \n \n  520 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  525 \n  \n  \nFigure 8: Ratio of the backscatter from ground level to the backscatter from canopy \nlevel  at HV with colour scale shown in dB. Non forest pixels are in black. The data are \nfrom the same Remningstorp scene as in Figs. 4 and 7. 530 \n SAR tomography therefore leads to better understanding of which processes contribute \nto the observed SAR signal, and should lead to both improved models of the interaction \nbetween radar waves and the forest canopy, and better inversion methods using \nintensity and Pol-InSAR. During the mission itself, it is proposed to further this process \nby including a short experimental phase devoted to SAR tomography.  535 \n 3.3. Exploiting intensity and Pol-InSAR information in biomass recovery  \n 24 \nSection 3.1 shows the use of intensity data in biomass retrieval, while Sections 3.2.1 \nand 3.2.3 respectively illustrate the derivation of canopy height from Pol-InSAR and \nthe retrieval of information on forest structure from SAR tomography. It is of \nconsiderable value that these independent types of information can be provided by the 540 \nsame SAR system and combined in biomass retrieval, as is illustrated in Fig. 9 using \ndata from Remningstorp. Here the retrieval is based on linear regression of the mean \nvalues of intensity, Pol-InSAR height and tomographic Ground to Volume backscatter \nratio derived from 10 reference plots of 80 m x 80 m, where accurate in situ biomass \nmeasurements are available. The figure shows the comparison between estimated 545 \nbiomass and in situ biomass for a) inversion of HV intensity data, b) inversion using \nHV and HH intensity data together with Pol-InSAR height, and c) inversion using HV \nand HH intensity data, Pol-InSAR height and the Ratio of Ground to Volume \nbackscatter at HV. The RMS error in biomass reduces as more information is added \ninto the inversion, going from 42.3 t ha\n-1\n when using just HV intensity (comparable to 550 \nthe inversion result in fig. 4, but with fewer test stands), to 27.9 t ha\n-1\n with the addition \nof HH and Pol-InSAR height, and to 11.0 t ha\n-1\n when the tomographic HV ground to \ncanopy backscatter ratio is included. The result in 9c indicates that the structure \ninformation provided by tomography enhances the information from Pol-InSAR height. \n 555 \n \n \n \n \n 560 \nRMSE= 42.28 t ha-1 RMSE= 27.93 t ha-1 RMSE= 11.02 t ha-1\n 25 \nFigure 9: Comparison of estimated and in situ biomass for a) inversion of HV intensity \ndata, b) inversion using HV & HH intensity data together with Pol-InSAR height, and \nc) inversion using HV & HH intensity data, Pol-InSAR height and the HV Ground to \nVolume backscatter ratio. Squares: spruce stands, circles: pine stands, and triangles: \nbirch stands. 565 \nThe inversion techniques are currently being tested on new airborne P-band datasets \nacquired to assess two important effects: a) the impact of topography on backscatter \nintensity and Pol-InSAR, and hence on biomass retrieval; this uses data acquired in \n2008 from a boreal forest with marked topography; b) the temporal decorrelation in \ntropical forests over time-intervals comparable with those for a spaceborne system (20-570 \n45 days), using data acquired in French Guiana in 2009.    \nAn important aim during the phase A studies is to provide better statistical \ncharacterisation of the errors in the inversions. As can be seen from Fig. 2, these errors \nare likely to depend on the biomass itself, as well as on issues such as system noise, \ncalibration errors and \u201cgeophysical\u201d scatter arising from environmental perturbations of 575 \nthe inversion relation. Joint error models are needed that take into account the different \nmeasurements, such as intensity data and information derived from Pol-InSAR. This \ninformation is important for quantifying not only the uncertainty in the estimated \nbiomass itself, but also how this propagates through carbon cycle estimates which make \nuse of it.  580 \n4 Measuring forest biomass change with time \nSection 3 has focused on measuring biomass itself, which is of basic importance for \nquantifying forest resources across the globe, but, as noted in Section 1, change in \nforest biomass is the crucial variable needed for quantifying carbon fluxes and their \neffects on climate.  585 \n 26 \n The BIOMASS mission will address this by providing consistent and repeated global \nobservations of forests throughout the mission lifetime. These observations will \ncontribute to quantifying the dynamics of forest biomass in three ways:  \n 1)  From the time series of estimated biomass in all major forest biomes produced by \nBIOMASS, the loss of biomass due to stand-removing disturbances can be easily 590 \nquantified.   \n2)  The increase of biomass due to forest regrowth in the first years after disturbance can be \nquantified at frequencies ranging from yearly to a single estimate over the whole 5-year \nmission duration, depending on the forest biome, species and site index (or site quality). In \ntropical forests, rates of growth can vary from 9 t ha\n-1\n yr\n-1\n to 21 t ha\n-1\n yr \n-1\n during the first 595 \n10 years of regrowth (Overman et al., 1994, Uhl et al., 1988), Such a differential rate of \nrecovery in the tropics is expected to be quantified by BIOMASS for different recovering \nareas. Conversely, for regions with very low recovery rate, the 5 year  lifetime of \nBIOMASS may not be sufficient. It is for example the case of Northern Eurasian forests in \nregions with low site quality which may accumulate in the first years less than 1 t ha\n-1\n yr\n-1\n 600 \n(IIASA 2007). \n 3)  Detection and estimation of forest degradation due to selective removal of timber and \nlocalised forest clearing requires the capability to detect changes in biomass in mature \nforest stands. Analysis based on simulated 256-look HH and HV data in inversion indicates \nthat, except for the lowest levels of biomass, changes in biomass of around 30% are 605 \ndetectable with error probability not exceeding 20% (European Space Agency, 2008).  \n5. Secondary mission objectives \nAlthough the primary focus of the BIOMASS mission is the measurement of forest \nbiomass and its changes, this first chance to explore the Earth's environment with a \nlong wavelength satellite SAR provides major new geoscience opportunities. In 610 \n 27 \nparticular, BIOMASS is expected to provide new information on subsurface structure \nin arid lands and polar ice, to extend existing information on forest inundation, and \npotentially to provide information on quantities such as soil moisture, permafrost and \nsea salinity. \n5.1 Subsurface geomorphology 615 \nLow frequency SAR is able to map the subsurface down to several meters in arid areas, \nthus has great potential for terrestrial applications, such as hydrology, geology, water \nand oil resources, and archaeology (Abdelsalam et al., 2000), in arid and semi-arid \nenvironments. In particular, the major drainage basins in North Africa are key features \nfor understanding climate change in the recent past, but are very poorly known. 620 \nComplete coverage of the eastern Sahara was provided by the Japanese JERS-1 L-band \nsatellite, allowing the creation of the first regional-scale radar mosaic covering Egypt, \nnorthern Sudan, eastern Libya and northern Chad (Paillou et al., 2009). Such \ncontinental-scale exploration is being continued with the PALSAR L-band radar on the \nJAXA ALOS satellite. Its improved data quality has allowed mapping of a 1200 km-625 \nlong palaeo-drainage system in eastern Libya that could have linked the Kufrah Basin \nto the Mediterranean coast (Paillou et al., 2009). Such a major drainage system has \nimportant implications for understanding the environments and climates of northern \nAfrica from the Late Miocene to the Holocene, with consequences for fauna, flora, \nhominid and human dispersal.  630 \nThese promising results from L-band are likely to be considerably improved by the \nincreased penetration offered at P-band. Using values of dielectric constant that are \ntypical for dry sandy sediments, an L-band SAR would have an expected penetration \ndepth of about 1.3 m, while P-band should penetrate to about 3.7 m. Aircraft campaigns \n 28 \nhave in fact demonstrated that P-band SAR can penetrate to at least 4 m in sandy 635 \nenvironments (Farr, 2001; Grandjean et al., 2001). \n5.2 Sub-surface ice structures and interferometric ice flow measurements  \nA limitation of shorter wavelength SAR systems (e.g. C-band) for ice studies is their \nlack of penetration into ice, together with the fact that surface change processes can \nproduce a loss of coherence in interferometric data. It is expected that the P-band signal 640 \nwill penetrate tens of metres of ice, thus reaching larger and more stable scatterers deep \nunder the ice surface. This not only means that subsurface structure can be investigated, \nbut also that interferometric coherence over ice should remain high, allowing the \nmonitoring of glacier displacements over longer time than can be achieved with \ninterferometry at higher frequencies (Mattar et al., 1998, Rignot et al., 2008). A P-band 645 \nSAR should then be able to fill the time-scale between days and years, providing \nvaluable information about glacier dynamics over periods that correspond to annual \nchange.   \n5.3 Forest inundation \nA basic requirement for modeling methane or carbon dioxide emissions from inundated 650 \nforests is information on the spatial and temporal distributions of inundated area. The \nability of long wavelength radar to map wetland inundation (for example, the Amazon \nand the Congo basins) has been demonstrated using JERS L-band data (Hess et al., \n2003, Martinez and Le Toan, 2007). Using ALOS PALSAR, the timing and duration of \nflooding over entire catchments have been spectacularly displayed (see 655 \nhttp:\/\/www.eorc.jaxa.jp\/ALOS\/kyoto\/jan2008\/pdf\/kc9_hess.pdf). Systematic data \nacquisition over all the inundated forest areas and the greater penetration into the forest \ncanopy by the BIOMASS sensor mean that it will add substantially to the time-series \n 29 \nbeing produced by PALSAR and allow the study of decadal trends and inter-annual \nvariations in the dynamics of these very important ecosystems.  660 \n6. Mission characteristics \nThe science requirements of the BIOMASS mission place strong constraints on the \ncharacteristics of the space segment. These are briefly discussed in this Section, which \npulls together many of the ideas set out in previous sections. A summary is also given \nin Table 1, and a more complete treatment will be found in the BIOMASS Report for 665 \nAssessment (European Space Agency, 2008). \nPolarimetry. Access to the full range of biomass encountered in the world\u201fs forests \nrequires measurement of forest height, and hence a fully polarimetric system in order to \nsupport polarimetric interferometry. In addition, direct methods of measuring forest \nbiomass benefit from using intensity measurements at multiple polarisations, and 670 \ncorrection of Faraday rotation caused by the ionosphere requires polarimetric data \n(Bickel and Bates, 1965; Freeman, 2004; Qi and Jin, 2007; Chen and Quegan, 2009). \nResolution. Two considerations underlie the choice of resolution of the BIOMASS \nsensor. The first is scientific, and is the need to make measurements at a scale \ncomparable to that of deforestation and forest disturbance, i.e. around 1 ha. The second 675 \nis forced by the ITU allocation of only 6 MHz to P-band for remote sensing, which \ncorresponds to a ground range resolution of around 50 m (depending on the incidence \nangle). It is envisaged that BIOMASS will provide level-1 products with around 50 m x \n50 m resolution at 4 looks. By applying optimal multi-channel filtering techniques to a \ntime-series of HH, HV and VV intensity data, the speckle in each image can be 680 \nsignificantly reduced without biasing the radiometric information in each image. For \nexample, a multi-temporal set of six such triplets of intensity data would yield an \nequivalent number of looks of around 40 or greater at each pixel (Quegan and Yu, \n 30 \n2001), so averaging 2x2 blocks of pixels would yield around 150 looks at a scale of 1 \nha, after allowing for inter-pixel correlation. This yields a radiometric accuracy better 685 \nthan 1 dB, which is sufficient to meet the science objectives.  \nIncidence angle. Airborne experiments have been carried out for incidence angles ranging \nfrom 25\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, and most indicate that the preferred incidence angle is in the range 40-\n45\u00b0.However system considerations are expected to favour steeper incidence angles. Currently, the \nminimum incidence angle is set to >23 degrees. Until now, the effect of incidence angles is not 690 \nthoroughly addressed. In a study on the sensitivity of  the SAR intensity (HV) to biomass (Dubois-\nFernandez et al., 2005), similar  backscatter coefficients  were obtained at 23\u00b0 and at 40\u00b0 for \nbiomass higher than 50 t ha\n-1\n, whereas for lower biomass, the backscatter signal is higher at 23\u00b0. \nThis is in line with current research based on airborne SAR tomography (Cf. Section 3.2.3) which \nsuggests that observations at incidence angles of 20\u00b0-30\u00b0 may increase the ground-to-695 \nvolume ratio, in particular for sparse forests and forests in regions with relief, hence \nincreasing the error in biomass retrieval based only on HV intensity. In this case, \nalgorithms based on a combination of different SAR measurements are required. \nQuantitative assessment of the effect of incidence angle on the SAR intensity, SAR \npolarimetry, and on PolInSAR and tomography  is currently undertaken in the mission 700 \nphase A, aiming at consolidating the choice of incidence angle and at improving the \nretrieval algorithms.  \nRevisit time. Forest height recovery using Pol-InSAR requires a revisit time small \nenough to maintain high temporal coherence between successive SAR acquisitions. \nAlthough this issue is still being investigated, preliminary results suggest that a time 705 \ninterval of between 25-45 days is acceptable. \nOrbit. A sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit will minimise ionospheric disturbances \n(Quegan et al., 2008).  \n 31 \nMission duration. A 5-year mission is planned in order to obtain repeated \nmeasurements of the world\u201fs forests. This will lead to reduced uncertainties in 710 \nmeasurements of the biomass of undisturbed forests and will allow measurement of \nforest dynamics by detecting changes in biomass and forest cover. Although the \nregrowth of fast-growing tropical forests may be detectable even with measurements \nspaced one or two years apart, measurement of regrowth in temperate forests requires \nas long a mission as possible. BIOMASS will have very limited capability for 715 \nmeasuring regrowth in the slowly-growing boreal forests.   \nTomography. The mission is expected to include a short tomographic phase during \nwhich measurements with 10-12 spatial baselines and a revisit time of 1-4 days will be \ncollected.  \n7. Summary and Conclusions 720 \nAt present, the status, dynamics and evolution of the terrestrial biosphere are the least \nunderstood and the most uncertain elements in the global carbon cycle, which is deeply \nimbedded in the functioning of the Earth system and its climate. There are very large \nuncertainties in the distribution of carbon stocks and carbon exchange, in the estimates \nof carbon emissions due to land use change, and in the uptake of carbon due to forest 725 \nregrowth. Forest biomass is the main repository of vegetation carbon and hence is a \ncrucial quantity needed to reduce these uncertainties. Both its spatial distribution and its \nchange with time are critical for improved knowledge of the terrestrial component of \nthe carbon cycle.  \nAlthough the need is great and urgent, there are no current biomass datasets that are 730 \nglobal, up-to-date, consistent, at spatial resolutions comparable with the scales of land \nuse change, or that are systematically updated to track biomass changes due to land use \nchange and regrowth. The BIOMASS mission is designed to address this severe \n 32 \nlimitation in our knowledge of the Earth and its functioning.  It will aid in building a \nsustained global carbon monitoring system that improves over time, thus helping 735 \nnations to quantify and manage their ecosystem resources, and to improve national \nreporting.  Its value will also extend well beyond the mission lifetime: since biomass in \nundisturbed forest changes relatively slow, the maps produced during the mission will \nprovide realistic values for calculations of emissions based on deforestation maps \nproduced by other means, such as optical or shorter wavelength radar sensors. 740 \nThe design of the BIOMASS mission is driven by science needs, and spins together two \nmain observational strands: (1) the long heritage of airborne observations in tropical, \ntemperate and boreal forest that have demonstrated the unique capabilities of P-band \nmulti-polarised SAR for measuring the world-wide range of forest biomass; (2) new \ndevelopments in recovery of forest height from Pol-InSAR, and, crucially, the 745 \nresistance of P-band to temporal decorrelation, which makes this frequency uniquely \nsuitable for biomass measurements with a single repeat-pass satellite. These two \ncomplementary measurement approaches are combined in the single BIOMASS sensor, \nand have the satisfying property that increasing biomass reduces the sensitivity of the \nformer approach while increasing the sensitivity of the latter. During phase A of the 750 \nmission, the inversion methods are consolidated using new experimental data acquired \nover forests with marked topography and over forests with very high biomass density. \nHowever, the BIOMASS P-band radar appears to be the only sensor capable of \nproviding the urgently needed global knowledge about biomass. It seizes the new \nopportunity from the allocation of a P-band frequency band for remote sensing by the 755 \nITU in 2003. It also will be a major addition to current efforts to build a global carbon \ndata assimilation system (Ciais et al., 2003) that will harness the capabilities of a range \nof satellites and in situ data. It is within this context that BIOMASS will find its fullest \n 33 \nexpression, both gaining from and complementing what can be learnt from other \nsatellite systems, ground data, and carbon cycle models. 760 \n \nReferences   \n \nAbdelsalam, M.
