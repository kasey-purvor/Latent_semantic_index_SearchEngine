This article highlights the \nunique political institution of early-twentieth-century Shanghai as a city state, \nwith its rule of law and secure property rights laying the foundation for eco-\nnomic growth in the Lower Yangzi with long-term impact throughout East Asia. \nhinese economic growth is not a recent phenomenon. Thomas \nRawski contends that China\u2019s per capita GDP growth had already \nattained a similar rate to that of Japan in the first three decades of the \ntwentieth century, a period also referred to as the Republican era. In \nfact, economic growth is a theme as enduring as Chinese economic \nhistory. The question raised by Joseph Needham, subsequently re-\nferred as the Needham puzzle, asked why, given her scientific, techno-\nlogical, and economic leadership over the rest of the world up until \nperhaps the fourteenth century, the Scientific Revolution and the In-\ndustrial Revolution bypassed China. More recently, a new wave of re-\nvisionist scholarship marked by Kenneth Pomeranz\u2019s book, The Great \nDivergence, extends this thesis with the provocative claim that levels \nof development and living standards in the Lower Yangzi region (his-\ntorically China\u2019s most advanced area) may have still been on a par \n\u0003The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 68, No. 2 (June 2008). \u00a9 The Economic History \nAssociation.

It \nwas accidental factors such as the absence of coal deposits in the \nLower Yangzi coupled with the natural resource windfalls from the \ndiscovery of the New World for Europe that tilted the balance after-\nward against China.1\n This article focuses on Chinese industrialization in the early twenti-\neth century, which was disproportionately concentrated in the Lower \nYangzi, a region situated largely within the two administrative prov-\ninces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang (hereafter abbreviated as \u201cJiang-Zhe\u201d). \nIt revisits the debate on Chinese economic growth in the Republican \nera from 1911 to 1936 with new, regional-level, quantitative evidence. \nIt offers a detailed sectoral reconstruction of the 1930s GDP estimates \nfor Jiang-Zhe within the national GDP framework proposed by Liu \nTa-chung and Yeh Kung-chia. The result shows that per capita GDP in \nJiang-Zhe in 1930s was about 55 percent higher than China\u2019s national \naverage, and 16\u201329 percent higher than those of Japanese-controlled \nKorea and Manchuria. It ranked only below Japan and Taiwan. Back-\nward projection based on my 1930s Jiang-Zhe benchmark shows \nstructural change and per-capita income growth comparable to those \nof Japan and her colonies between the 1910s and 1930s and an eco-\nnomic structure far removed from a traditional agrarian economy. \n A striking feature of this distinctively regional economic growth is \nthat it took-off in an era of national disintegration and civil strife. The \narticle offers a narrative to demonstrate that the pattern of industriali-\nzation, especially its absence during the latter half of the nineteenth \ncentury followed by a surge in the early twentieth century, speak to \nthe importance of ideological and institutional changes in modern \nChina. In particular, during China\u2019s tumultuous Warlord era in the \n1910s and 1920s, Shanghai transformed from a colonial treaty port to \na European style city-state under the rule of Western business elites \nand provided effective public security and private property rights for \nboth Chinese and foreign business within its jurisdiction. Despite the \nsuperior historical conditions of the Lower Yangzi (as recently \nchampioned by Kenneth Pomeranz and others), early-twentieth-\ncentury economic growth in the Lower Yangzi did not grow out of \ntraditional institutions, but rather grew outside of them. Going be-\nyond resource endowments, I highlight institutions as crucial deter-\nminants of long-term economic change. \n1 See Thomas Rawski, Economic Growth; and Mark Elvin, Patterns. A recent summary of \nthis literature on this theme can be found in Ma, \u201cGrowth.\u201d \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 357 \nFIGURE 1\nMAP OF LOWER YANGZI AND OTHER MACRO-REGIONS IN CHINA \nNotes: The bold dark lines mark the provincial boundaries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. \n For Jiangsu province, the Lower Yangzi Macro-Region (in dark shade) includes the following \nprefectures in Jiangsu province: Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiangnin, Changzhou, Taicang, Zhengjiang, \nYangzhou, Tongzhou, Haimen, Haizhou, and the City of Shanghai; and the following prefec-\ntures in Zhejiang province: Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Yanzhou, Caoxin, Ningbo, Cuzhou, \nand Jinhua. \n The prefectures outside the Lower Yangzi Macro-Region (in light shade) are Xuzhou and \nHua-An for Jiangsu province and Wenzhou and Taizhou for Zhjiang province.  \n The ten macro-regions that Skinner defined are Manchuria, North China, Northwester China, \nUpper, Middle and Lower Yangzis, Yungui, Lingna,n and Southeast Coast. For detailed \nboundaries of macro-regions, see Skinner, \u201cPresidential Addrss,\u201d p. 273. \n358 Ma\nECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LOWER YANGZI: A REGIONAL \nQUANTITATIVE RECORD \nLower Yangzi: The Historical Setting \n The Lower Yangzi is one of the ten economic macro-regions defined \nby William Skinner. Marked in dark shade in the map (Figure 1), it in-\ncludes eight of the ten prefectures in Zhejiang province and ten of the \n12 prefectures in the Jiangsu province plus the city of Shanghai. The \nLower Yangzi macro-region constitutes a relatively integrated cultural, \neconomic, and geographic region distinguished from those outlying pre-\nfectures in the Jiang-Zhe provinces in levels of development, degrees of \ncommercialization, culture, and dialects. \n Due to the nature of the data, my quantitative analysis in this study is \nlargely based on the administrative boundaries of Jiang-Zhe provinces \nwith due references to the somewhat smaller \u201cLower Yangzi Macro-\nRegion\u201d where necessary, while \u201cLower Yangzi\u201d will remain a generic \nterm for the area.2 At 210,741 square kilometers, roughly 86 percent the \nsize of Britain and 56 percent the size of Japan, and with over 60 mil-\nlion residents in the 1930s, Jiang-Zhe is a substantial economic region, \nalbeit only a small part of China. \n The Lower Yangzi occupies a central place in recent revisionist lit-\nerature on eighteenth-century China. While a full evaluation of this lit-\nerature is beyond the scope of this article, I offer a perspective here with \na regional macroeconomic framework.3 In the absence of any national \nor regional GDP data for China in the mid-eighteenth century, I make \nuse of the tax revenue records to get a crude approximation of the per \ncapita income difference between the Lower Yangzi and the rest of \nChina. My calculation based on Wang Yeh-chien\u2019s study on Qing taxa-\ntion shows that the per capita tax revenue contributed by the Jiang-Zhe \nprovinces in 1753 was 1.44 times the national average.4\n2 Skinner also defines a so-called Lower Yangzi Core which would only include the prefec-\ntures of Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiangnin, Changzhou Taicang, and the city of Shanghai in Jiangsu \nprovince and the prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang province. This \nsmall and undoubtedly most advanced and commercialized region, often known as the Jiangnan \nregion, is most often discussed by Pomeranz and Li Bozhong, See Li Bozhong, Agricultural \nDevelopment, chapter 1. \n3 A recent summary of this revisionist scholarship can be found in Ma, \u201cGrowth.\u201d \n4 Tax data are from Wang, Land Taxation, p. 70. Wang\u2019s grand total is used. Population is for \n1787 from p. 87 (table 5.1). To use per capita tax revenue as a proxy for per capita income car-\nries the strong assumption that tax revenue is proportional to income and that the taxation sys-\ntem was efficient and corruption-free, or at least the degree of corruption varies little by region. \nFor Wang\u2019s argument for a relatively efficient tax system in 1753, see chapters 4 and 5. Inciden-\ntally, the 1.44 figure derived is nearly identical to the 1.43 ratio equivalent for that of 1910s as \nshown later in Table 3. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 359 \n The \u201cguess-estimates\u201d in the global dataset by Angus Maddison show \nthe British, West European, and European (including East Europe but \nnot Russia and Turkey) per-capita income figures are 2, 1.7, and 1.45 \ntimes the level of China in 1700, respectively.5 If the Jiang-Zhe per cap-\nita income could be assumed to be 1.44 times of that of China, as im-\nplied in the tax records, this would equal 72 percent, 85 percent, and \nabout 100 percent of the per capita income of Britain, Western Europe, \nand Europe overall, respectively. It would also be slightly higher than \nMaddison\u2019s guess-estimated level for early-nineteenth-century Japan.6\nClearly, both tax-revenue-based, regional-income-difference estimates \nand Maddison\u2019s guess-estimates are highly speculative. But this exer-\ncise is useful to show that a regional perspective could alter our pre-\nexisting views on Jiang-Zhe\u2019s relative backwardness in the early mod-\nern period. 7\nShanghai-Based Industrialization: The Regional Picture \n In the 1930s Shanghai alone produced 41 percent of national manu-\nfacturing output (48 percent if excluding Japanese-controlled Manchu-\nria); housed 50 to 60 percent of cotton spindles throughout the 1910s \nand 1930s; and generated about 50 percent of national electricity in the \n1920s, almost twice that of the major British industrial cities of Man-\nchester and Glasgow. In the 1930s, Shanghai alone absorbed 46.4 per-\ncent of total foreign direct investment (FDI) in China and 67 percent of \nFDI in manufacturing and claimed 47.8 percent of China\u2019s financial \ncapital. With more than half of China\u2019s foreign trade and one-fifth of \nthe Chinese shipping tonnage sailing through its harbor. Shanghai was \nthe commercial, financial, and industrial city of China in the early twen-\n5 Maddison gives China, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Britain per capita incomes of \n600, 566, 1,024, and 1,250 respectively (in 1990 international $), Maddison, World Economy,\np. 264, table B-21. Also see Maddison, Chinese Economic Performance, p. 25, for the European \nper capita average.  \n6 For Japan, Maddison gives per capita income as 12 percent and 40 percent higher than \nChina\u2019s in 1820 and 1870 respectively, see World Economy, p. 264. These are below Jiang-\nZhe\u2019s 44 percent gap over China in the mid-eighteenth century.  \n7 For Japanese revisionism, see Akira Hayami, Kinsei Nihon; and Hanley and Yamamura, \nEconomic and Demographic Change. The absence of a regional perspective often accounts for \nthe so-called Japanese exceptionalism vis-\u00e0-vis her Asian neighbors, as found in \u201cSocial Struc-\nture\u201d by James Nakamura and Matao Miyamoto, where they viewed stagnant population growth \nin Tokugawa Japan as a precocious demographic transition for a premodern society in contrast \nto the case of Malthusian population explosion that gripped China during the seventeenth and \neighteenth centuries. It is true that population statistics of 1600\u20131850 seems to confirm a faster \nChinese growth rate of 0.37 percent versus that of Japan at 0.21 percent. But annualized popula-\ntion growth in Jiang-Zhe was only 0.14 percent in 1630\u20131851, even slower than in Japan. For \npopulation figures of China and Japan, see Maddison, World Economy, p. 40. The Jiang-zhe \nprovincial figures are from Chao Shuji, Zhongguo, vol. 4, p. 452, and vol. 5, p. 703. \n360 Ma\ntieth century.8 Its population doubled from only half a million in the \n1890s, to over a million in the 1910s, and to about 3.5 million in the \n1930s, making it the world\u2019s seventh largest city.9 These staggering sta-\ntistics lead some scholars to refer to China\u2019s early-twentieth-century \ngrowth as Shanghai-based industrialization. \n The Shanghai-based industrialization occurred during China\u2019s first \nmajor phase of modern industrial expansion dated from the mid-1890s. \nDu Xuncheng shows that nominal annual industrial investment by Chi-\nnese nationals from 1914 to 1925 was 11 times that of the 1840\u20131911 \nperiod.10 The capital of a modern Chinese banking sector, largely non-\nexistent before the mid-1890s, multiplied at an annual rate of 10.2 per-\ncent between 1897 and 1936. C. F. Remer displays a corresponding \ngrowth in foreign investment at annual rates of 8.3 percent, 5 percent,  \nand 4.3 percent respectively for Shanghai, Manchuria, and the rest of \nChina between 1902 and 1931. Railroad mileage built surged from a \nmere 364 kilometers until 1894 to over 21,000 by 1937. The national \nindustrial output index constructed by John Chang, shows an annual \nreal growth rate of 10 percent for the period of 1912\u20131936, a phenome-\nnal growth rate by the standard of the time.11\n John Chang\u2019s industrial output index covers the output of modern \n\u201cfactory\u201d employing seven or more workers. It includes 15 products, ten \nof which are mineral and metallurgical commodities. Overall, these 15 \nproducts cover between 40 and 50 percent the total modern factory out-\nput.12 The growth rate implicit in the Chang index turns out to be up-\nward biased due to its over-representation of the fastest-growing mining \nsectors, part of which was launched in Manchuria of Northeast China \nunder Japanese colonialism from 1931.13 Recently, Toru Kubo revised \nChang\u2019s annual series by updating the cotton output series and adding \n8 See the Appendix; Xiong, Shanghai, vol. 1, p. 19; Remer, p. 97; and Zhang, Zhong-li, Jin-\ndai Shanghai, pp. 312\u201313.  \n9 Murphey, Shanghai, p. 22. \n10 The calculation is from Cheng Linsun, Banking, p. 41. If the mid-1890s rather than 1911 as \nthe cut-off period were used, the contrast of industrial expansion versus stagnation would be \neven sharper.  \n11 See Cheng, Linsun, Banking, p. 71; Remer, Foreign Investment, p. 73; Yan Zhongpin et al., \nZhongguo, p. 180; and Chang, Industrial Investment, pp. 60\u201361.\n12 See Chang, Industrial Development, p. 36; and Kubo, Industrial Development, p. 11. \n13 This bias is noted by Chang himself. To gauge the extent of the bias, Chang shows sepa-\nrately the industrial output series between Manchuria and China proper (which is the rest of \nChina excluding Manchuria) whose real annual growth rates turn out to be 14 percent and 6.4 \npercent respectively in 1926\u20131936 (Industrial Development, p. 103). In a separate study on the \nManchurian economy, Kang Chao gives a real growth rate of 8.8 percent for modern industry \nduring the same period (Economic Development, p.84). As Chao\u2019s sectoral coverage of modern \nindustry is much larger (therefore a correspondingly smaller share for the mining sector) than \nChang\u2019s, its slower rate for Manchuria (8.8 percent versus 14 percent) confirms the upward bias \ninherent in the Chang index due to its large weight assigned to the fast-growing mining sector. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 361 \nimportant light industrial products such as silk and flour. The Kubo in-\ndex as presented in Table 1 raises the total coverage to 72 percent and \nreduces the real annual growth rates to 8.4 percent for 1912\u20131936.14\n We now compare these national indices with the new modern indus-\ntrial gross output series for Shanghai constructed by Xu Xinwu and \nHuang Hanming, for the benchmarks of 1895, 1911, 1925, and 1936 \nbased on 1936 prices. The Shanghai index by Xu and Huang, as pre-\nsented in Table 1, covers nine sectors including textiles (cotton, silk, \nand wool), flour milling, matches, cigarettes, paper, pharmacy, and ma-\nchinery repair as well as estimates for other sectors. In the absence of \nany mining sectors, modern industry in Shanghai attained a real annual \ngrowth rate of 9.6 percent, faster than the Chinese national average of \n8.4 percent as revealed by the Kubo index. Because the national average \nincluded the fast-growing Shanghai and Manchuria, the difference in \ngrowth rates between Shanghai and the rest of China outside of these \nregions would be larger than is shown in Table 1.15\n Modern industrial growth in Shanghai compares favorably with Japa-\nnese industrial performance as measured by those produced by modern \nfactories employing more than five workers. Table 1 shows that Shang-\nhai\u2019s growth rate leads Japan both for the 1895\u20131911 and the 1912-\n1936 periods, matched possibly only by Korea in the Japanese colonial \nera of 1912\u20131936.16\n Shanghai-based industrialization spilled over to the rest of China but \nmost directly to her immediate hinterland, the Lower Yangzi region. For \nthe Lower Yangzi, Shanghai became a massive draw for labor and a \nmajor source of capital and entrepreneurship. Shanghai capital sup-\nported the renowned scholar-bureaucrat-entrepreneur Zhang Qian in \nturning Nantong in Jiangsu province into an industrial city. Capital in-\nfusion from Wuxi-born industrial tycoons in Shanghai transformed the \nmarket town of Wuxi into China\u2019s fifth largest industrial city by the \n14 The new Kubo index also confirms Rawski\u2019s crude point estimates of modern industry \nmade for this period. Rawski\u2019s point estimates of factory output between 1912 and 1936 (in \n1933 prices) had a broader coverage of sectors with a 73 percent share of total output and a real \ngrowth rate of 8.1 percent. See Rawski, Economic Growth, pp. 353\u201359. \n15 Assuming Shanghai and Manchuria having a 60 percent share in China\u2019s modern industry \nin the 1930s and a combined growth rate of 9.6 in 1911-36 versus an overall 8.4 percent growth \nrate for the whole of China, a back-of-the envelope calculation would give a 6.6 percent annual \ngrowth rate for the rest of China excluding Shanghai and Manchuria.  \n16 See Ohkawa, Growth Rate, p. 78. Note that as the growth spurt of modern industry in Japan \nstarted well before 1895, Japanese industrial expansion in the twentieth century started from a \nlarger base than did Shanghai\u2019s. For industrial growth in Taiwan and Korea during this period, \nsee Mizoguchi and Umemura, Basic Economic Statistics, pp. 273 and 276, respectively.  \n362 Ma\nTABLE 1\nANNUALIZED REAL GROWTH RATES OF MODERN INDUSTRY OUTPUT IN CHINA \nAND JAPAN \n(percentages) \n  China     \n  Chang Index  Kubo Index  Shanghai  Japan \n1880\u20131895       10\n1895\u20131912     9.4  5.7\n1912\u20131925 12.6  10  12  8.6\n1925\u20131936 7.4  5.4  6.5  9.5\n1912\u20131936 10.2  8.4  9.6  8.3\nSources: The Chang index is from Chang, Industrial Development, p. 60, table 14.

In 1933 the industrial output of Jiangsu province reached about \n13 percent of that of China proper (excluding Manchuria), trailing only \nbehind Shanghai and Japanese-controlled Manchuria.18\n Shanghai-based industrialization also impacted the agriculture sector. \nIndustrial demand brought direct impetus to the improvement of major \nindustrial cash crops such as cotton and silk cocoons through the diffu-\nsion of new scientific seeds and practices; and accelerated the adoption \nof commercial fertilizers and the introduction of power-driven agricul-\ntural machines such as water pumps and rice and flour mills.19\nThe Regional Production Accounts \n The most comprehensive way to register economic activities is the \nnational income framework.

I first estimate the ratio of Jiang-Zhe gross value output \n(GVO) in China\u2019s total and then use this ratio to multiply China\u2019s NVA \nfor that sector to derive the Jiang-Zhe NVA.21 Mathematically it is ex-\npressed as \n  Jiang-Zhe NVAi = iCHINAi\nCHINA\nR\ni\nR\nNVA\nGVO\nGVO\nu\n\u00a6\n \n3\n1\nwhere i stands for the ith of the 13 sectors and R stands for the Rth prov-\ninces or city, namely, Jiangsu, Zhejiang province and the city of Shang-\nhai. The Jiang-Zhe Net Domestic Product (NDP) is the summation of all \n13 sectors\u2019 net value added. As Liu and Yeh\u2019s estimation of Chinese \nGDP conducted in 1965 is much more consistent in terms of theoretical \nframework and price and quantity information, I use their national GDP \nfigure and NVAs for all the 13 sectors. My contribution here, as shown \nin the Appendix, is to derive the GVO ratio of Jiang-Zhe for China. For \nthat, I make use of the rich regional-level data from Ou et al. as well as \nother available sources as detailed in the Appendix.22\n Table 2 presents my estimate of the Jiang-Zhe NDP for the 1930s \nwith a detailed breakdown of all 13 sectors. The details of data sources \nand calculations are reported in the Appendix. Of the 13 sectors esti-\nmated, the coverage of products for agriculture in this study is 67 per-\ncent of the total, 60 percent for handicrafts, and 100 percent for modern \n20 Ou et al., Zhongguo Guomin Suode; and Li and Yeh, Economy. There are other GDP esti-\nmates for the 1880s, the 1910s, and 1946. They rely heavily on backward or forward projection \nfrom the 1933 benchmark estimate. For the 1880s, 1910s, and 1946 GDP estimates, see respec-\ntively, Chang Chungli, Income, appendix; Yeh, \u201cChina\u2019s National Income\u201d; and Ou et al., \nZhongguo Guomin Suode.\n21 This formula implicitly assumes the ratio of GVOs between China and Jiang-Zhe are equal \nto the ratio of NVD, an assumption that could introduce upward bias in the Jiang-Zhe aggregate \nNVA estimate given that Jiang-Zhe\u2019s NVD to output ratio was likely lower than that of China. \nHowever, this bias is likely to be insignificant. We can illustrate with an example of Japanese \nand Chinese agriculture in the 1930s, whose NVD-output ratios are about 0.84 and 0.9 respec-\ntively. See Ohkawa and Shinohara, Japanese Economic Growth, p. 290; and Liu and Yeh, \nEconomy, p. 140. Applying the Chinese ratio of 0.9 ratio to both countries, only leads to an up-\nward bias of only 0.7 percent for the agricultural NVD for Japan.  \n22 Both Liu and Yeh and Ou et al. consistently included the whole of China by adding the re-\ngional figures for Japanese-controlled Manchuria where necessary. In cases where regional data \nother than those Ou et al.\u2019s are used, I have made similar adjustments to ensure geographic con-\nsistency. For example, for sectors such as agriculture and modern industry, I have added the \nManchuria data into the national total as explained in the Appendix.  \n364 Ma\nTABLE 2\nNET DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY SECTOR OF ORIGIN FOR CHINA AND THE  \nJIANG-ZHE PROVINCES IN 1933 \n(in billion yuans) \nNet Value Added   \n China \nJiang-Zhe\nProvinces\nJiang-Zhe Share \n(percent) \nAgriculture  18.76 2.81 15\nFactories 0.64 0.37 57\nHandicrafts  2.04 0.41 20\nMining 0.21 0 Negligible\nUtilities  0.13 0.059 45\nConstruction 0.34 0.1 30\nModern transportation and communication  0.43  0.09  21 \nOld-fashioned transportation  1.2  0.29  24 \nTrade 2.71 0.76 28\nGovernment administration  0.82  0.1  12 \nFinance 0.21 0.14 65\nPersonal services  0.34  0.082  24 \nResidential rents  1.03  0.25  24 \nNet domestic product   28.86  5.45  19 \nPer capita NNP (yuan)  57.36  88.92  155 \nPopulation (millions)  503.1  60.4  12 \nLand area (million square kms)  966  21  2\nCultivated area (million shi mou)  1,543  143  9.3\nSources: See the Appendix.

How-\never, except for three sectors (less than 9 percent of the NDP), which \nwere guess-estimated from crude assumptions, all other sectors are sup-\nported by some form of regional data. \n Table 2 shows that in 1933 the Jiang-Zhe provinces, with a 12 per-\ncent share of the Chinese population, contributed 15 percent of agricul-\nture, 20 percent of handicrafts, 57 percent of modern factory output, 65 \npercent of finance and 45 percent of modern utilities services. Taken to-\ngether the Jiang-Zhe provinces had 19 percent of China\u2019s NDP, with a \nper capita NDP 1.55 times the national average. Output produced by \nmodern factories had a much larger impact in Jiang-Zhe, reaching 7 \npercent of NDP versus only 2 percent for China. The share of modern-\nfactory in total manufacturing output (including both factory and tradi-\ntional handicraft production) was 47 percent for Jiang-Zhe versus only \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 365 \n24 percent for China. This ratio likely puts Jiang-Zhe on about the same \nlevel as Japan in the 1900s or the 1910s.23\n Rawski\u2019s unpublished manuscript also offers a GDP estimate for \nwhat he defines as the \u201cLower Yangzi Core\u201d in the 1930s. His per cap-\nita income estimate for the core is only 37 percent above the national \naverage, lower than my 55 percent. His \u201cLower Yangzi Core\u201d has a 7.8 \npercent share of China\u2019s population compared to 12 percent for Jiang-\nZhe. As Rawski\u2019s manuscript does not present details of geographic \ndefinition or data sources, it is hard to pinpoint the sources of discrep-\nancy. My crude guess is that there are differences in geographic cover-\nage and possible underestimation of agricultural and handicraft sectors \nin his estimates.24\nGrowth and Structural Change \n Rawski\u2019s 1989 book, Economic Growth in Prewar China, provides a \nmost comprehensive reassessment of Chinese economic growth during \nthe Republican era and derives a new estimate of national per capita in-\ncome growth rate of 1.1\u20131.2 percent, not much below the Japanese rate \nof growth of about 1.4 percent between the 1910s and 1930s. This is a \nremarkably optimistic assessment compared with earlier estimates of \nannual growth rate of per capita GDP at 0.33 percent for this period.25\nAs there is no 1914\u20131918 benchmark GDP data for China. Rawski, fol-\nlowing Yeh Kung-chia, use sectoral series of real growth rates to derive \nthe real GDP growth rates between 1914\u20131918 and 1931\u20131936. \n Given the small share of the fastest growing modern sectors, Rawski\u2019s \nupward revision of per capita Chinese GDP growth rate between 1914\u2013\n1918 and 1931\u20131936 from Yeh\u2019s 0.33 percent to 1.1\u20131.2 percent hinges \non a reassessment of the agricultural sector, which accounted for more \nthan 60 percent of GDP. In the absence of reliable agricultural output \ndata for 1914\u20131918, Rawski uses the growth rate of several scattered se-\nries of agricultural real wages to derive his real per capita agricultural \noutput series between the 1910s and 1930s. The annual 1.4\u20131.7 percent \ngrowth in per capita agricultural output thus derived raises his overall \n1930s Chinese per-capita income estimate 16 percent above that of Liu \n23 Factory output accounted for only 4 percent and 6 percent of Japanese NDP in 1885 and \n1900 respectively. The factory to manufacturing output ratio was 41.2 percent in 1895. Because \nthe Japanese definition of factory (enterprises with five or more employees) is broader than the \nChinese definition (enterprises with 30 or more employees), the Japanese ratio should be ad-\njusted downward to be comparable. See Ohkawa and Rosovsky, Japanese Economic Growth,\npp. 15 and 80\u201382. \n24 See Rawski, \u201cEconomy,\u201d p. 68 for his estimate. \n25 See Rawski, Economic Growth, p. 330; and Yeh, \u201cChina\u2019s National Income,\u201d p. 120. \n366 Ma\nand Yeh\u2019s original estimate. Without this upward revision in agricultural \noutput, Rawski\u2019s revised per-capita income would only be 6 percent \nhigher than the Liu and Yeh estimate and the annual GDP per capita \ngrowth rate between the 1910s and 1930s would decrease to 0.5 percent, \nnot that different from the original 0.33 percent rate by Yeh.26\n Here, I establish a case of regional economic growth without such \n\u201caggressive\u201d assumptions about agricultural performance. Given there \nare no sectoral growth rates for Jiang-Zhe provinces during this period, \nI use the same rates for China established by Rawski except for agricul-\nture, where I use Yeh\u2019s original rate of 0.8 percent. Because Jiang-Zhe \nis likely to grow faster at the sectoral level than China, the assumption \nof equal rates for the two establishes a lower-bound estimate for Jiang-\nZhe GDP growth rates between the 1910s and 1930s, with differences \nin growth rates between Jiang-Zhe and China driven entirely by their \ndifferent sectoral weights.\n Table 3 shows that annual per capita NDP growth in both Jiang-Zhe \nprovinces, at 1 percent, were roughly double that of China and almost \nmatched those of Japan and her colonies during this period. So, even in \nthe absence of the \u201cRawskian\u201d type of upward revision in agricultural \noutput growth, the growth rate in per capita terms in Jiang-Zhe\u2014not \nChina\u2014had already achieved rates comparable to those of her East Asian \nneighbors. If we apply Rawski\u2019s revised agricultural growth rate of 1.55 \npercent rather than the original 0.8 percent used by Yeh and hold every-\nthing else the same, the overall Chinese per capita GDP between 1914\u2013\n1918 and 1931\u20131936 is raised to 1 percent per year, and the Jiang-Zhe \nper capita GDP growth rate attains 1.4 percent, giving the region one of \nthe highest growth records in East Asia for the period.27 In either sce-\nnario, the case for regional growth can be established beyond dispute. \n The case for regional growth can be further strengthened if we com-\npare the growth rate in Jiang-Zhe with the rest of China excluding Ji-\nang-Zhe and Manchuria. With an overall Chinese per capita growth rate \nof 0.53 between the 1910s and 1930s, and assuming a combined annual \nper capita growth rate of 1 percent for Jiang-Zhe and Manchuria with a \ntotal of 25 percent share in overall Chinese GDP, the annual per capita \nGDP rate of growth for the rest of China (excluding Jiang-Zhe and \nManchuria) will be 0.37. This is just about a third of the growth rate of \nJiang-Zhe in this Republican era, a finding that confirms Rawski\u2019s ob-\nservation that \u201cregional growth in Manchuria, . . . and probably in the \n26 See Rawski, Economic Growth, pp. 280\u2013337.  \n27 It is important to note that as population growth rates in Japan and her colonies were higher \nthan that of Jiang-zhe and China for this period, the gap in total output growth remains despite \nthe comparable per capita rates as shown in Table 3. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 367 \nTABLE 3\nPER CAPITA NDP AND NDP COMPOSITION IN EAST ASIA IN 1914\u20131918 AND  \n1931\u20131936\n(1930s Chinese Yuan) \nChina\nJiang-Zhe\nProvinces\nLower\nYangzi\nMacro-\nRegion Japan Taiwan Korea  Manchuria \n1914\u20131918\nPer Capita NDP  52.4 75.2 83.2 161 102 64  \nAs percentage of China  100 143 159 305 195 122  \nNDP Composition (in %)         \n Agriculture  71 60 57 29 48 66  \n Industry  8 10 11 20 29 7  \n Services   21 30 32 51 23 24  \n1931\u20131936\nPer Capita NDP  57.4 88.9 100 203  132  77  69 \nAs percentage of China    100 155 174 354 230 134 120 \nNDP Composition (in %)         \n Agriculture  65 52 47 19 44 53 36 \n Industry  10 14 16 28 27 13 20 \n Services   25 34 37 53 29 34 44 \nAnnual per capita NDP \ngrowth rate between \n1914\u20131918 and  \n1931\u20131936  0.53 1.0 1.1 1.4 1.5 1.1  \nPopulation (million) in  \n1931\u20131936  503.1 60.4 44.7 67.2 5.1 21.2 38.7 \nSource Notes: The averages of NDP (all in 1934\u20131936 constant prices) and population in 1914\u2013\n1918 and 1931\u20131936 for Japan, Taiwan, and Korea are calculated from Mizoguchi and Ume-\nmura, Basic Economic Statistics, pp. 228\u201329, 232\u201333, and 236\u201337, respectively.  \n \u201cIndustry\u201d includes factory, handicrafts, and mining. \u201cServices\u201d include sectors other than ag-\nriculture and industry.  \n Growth rates used for the 13 sectors (except for agriculture) to project the 1931\u20131936 China \nand Jiang-Zhe series backward to the 1914\u20131918 are from Rawski, Economic Growth, p. 274. \nThey are 0.8, 8.1, 8.1, 8.1, 1.4, 4.6, 3, 1.9, 2.5, 5, 3.4, 0.9, and 0.8 percent respectively for agri-\nculture, modern factory, mining, utilities, handicrafts, construction, modern transportation and \ncommunication, traditional transportation and communication, trade, finance, government ad-\nministration, personal services, and residential rents.  \n Population figures for China and Jiang-Zhe provinces in 1914\u20131918 are 440 and 54.1 million, \nrespectively. China\u2019s 440 million population in 1914\u20131918 is from Yeh, \u201cChina\u2019s National In-\ncome,\u201d p. 104. The population figures for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are 33.7 and 19.2 mil-\nlion, respectively, from Perkins, Agricultural Development, p. 212. Adding the 1.2 million \nShanghai population sums to 54.1 million for Jiang-Zhe (Shanghai population is from Murphey, \nShanghai, p. 23).  \n The Lower Yangzi Macro-Region per capita income can be calculated as: YLY = (YJZ - YC u\nPEX ) \u00f7 PLY; where YLY, YJZ and YC, stand for the per capita incomes of the Lower Yangzi Macro-\nRegion, Jiang-Zhe, and China respectively, and PLY and PEX denote the respective population \nshares of the Lower Yangzi Macro-Region and the remaining four prefectures in Jiang-Zhe \nprovinces. The prefectural-level data in 1910 is from Chao Suji, Zhongguo Renkoushi, vol. 5, \npp. 691\u201392, which shows that population in the Lower Yangzi Region had a share of 74 percent \nof the Jiang-Zhe provinces. The same 74 percent is applied to calculate the 1931\u20131936 popula-\ntion of the Lower Yangzi Macro-Region. \n368 Ma\nTABLE 3 \u2014 continued \n Manchuria (for 1934) is from Eckstein, Chao, and Chang, \u201cEconomic Development,\u201d \npp. 254\u201355. These estimates of per capita income are consistent with more recent work by  \nYamamoto Yuzou, Nihon Shokuminchi, p. 116. \n The exchange rate is equal to 1 yuan = 1.1 yen calculated as the average of 1933\u20131936 from \nHsiao, China\u2019s Foreign Trade Statistics, p. 192. \nLower Yangtze areas of China may have progressed more rapidly than \nthe national average, thus ensuring that other regions experienced below \naverage, and possibly negative, growth.\u201d28\n Table 3 also confirms that the absolute level of per-capita income in \nJiang-Zhe based on 1930 exchange-rate conversions was higher than \nthose of Korea and Manchuria, ranking third only after Japan and Tai-\nwan in the 1930s.29 It shows the economic structures of the Jiang-Zhe in \n1914\u20131918 and 1931\u20131936 were characterized by shares in industry and \nservice sectors much higher than those that defined the primarily agrar-\nian China. With a population almost the size of Japan\u2019s and more than \nten times that of Taiwan in the 1930s, Jiang-Zhe was clearly the second \nlargest industrial region in East Asia (perhaps Asia). \n Table 3 shows the per capita GDP estimate of the Lower Yangzi Macro-\nRegion (see Figure 1), calculated assuming that the per-capita income of \nthe four prefectures outside the \u201cMacro-Region\u201d but within Jiang-Zhe were \nequal to China\u2019s national average (including that of the Jiang-Zhe Prov-\ninces). This calculation shows that the per capita income for the Lower \nYangzi Macro-Region in 1933 at 1.74 times the level of China, with an \neconomic structure even further \u201cadvanced\u201d than China and Jiang-Zhe. \n Any causal statements linking these growth figures to human welfare \nshould hinge on further research on consumption expenditure and income \ndistribution. Existing studies based on household income and consumption \nsurveys conducted during the 1920s and 1930s seem to point to higher \nhousehold income and consumption standards in Shanghai than in other ur-\nban centers outside the Lower Yangzi. Some other surveys conducted for ru-\nral households also seem to point to similarly higher levels in Jiang-Zhe than \nin other parts of China. However, without careful control for differences in \nsampling methods and regional price effects, these findings only remain very \ntentative support for the outcome of my production-based study.30\n28 See Rawski, Economic Growth, p. 271.  \n29 For the conversion of per capita incomes based on purchasing power parity (PPP) for \nChina, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan relative to the United States in the 1930s, see Fukao, Ma, and \nYuan, \u201cReal GDP.\u201d  \n30 For the higher household income and consumption levels of Shanghai urban working fami-\nlies, see Yang Ximeng, \u201cShanghai,\u201d pp. 358\u201359.

For regional classifications, see \nibid., table 3.  \n Recent anthropometric research by Stephen Morgan seems more de-\nfinitive. Analyzing thousands of height records of railway employees \nacross China, Morgan concludes that from the last years of the nine-\nteenth century to the second half of the 1920s, the average male stature \nin China increased 0.25cm per decade but grew by 0.7cm per decade in \nJiang-Zhe provinces. This 0.7 cm per decade height increase is only \nslightly lower than the 0.91 cm per decade increase for Japan between \n1892 and 1937. In fact, Morgan\u2019s regional figure for railway skilled \nworkers, reproduced here in Figure 2 shows that only the average height \nof Jiang-Zhe subjects (classified by Morgan as \u201cEast\u201d in the figure) \nshows a consistent upward trend, while average heights in North China, \nCentral China, and South China either stagnated or fluctuated between \n1900 and 1929. This evidence leads him to conclude a spatially differ-\nentiated and uneven pattern of economic growth, a finding that lends \nstrong support to this study.31\n31 See Morgan, \u201cEconomic Growth,\u201d figure 6 and concluding statement.

The contrast \nis particularly puzzling given the emergence of Chinese mercantile \ndominance across regions of East and Southeast Asia after the mid-\nnineteenth century under a free-trade regime imposed by Western impe-\nrialism. In particular, Shanghai, as a newly opened treaty port, rapidly \nemerged as the node of a vast trading network that enveloped, among \nothers, the Japanese treaty ports of Yokohama and Kobe. In fact, the \ndominance and solidarity of the Chinese merchant network throughout \nAsia posed a challenge to the young Meiji government as formidable as \nits agenda of catching-up with the West.32 To tackle the puzzle of Chi-\nnese industrialization in nineteenth-century China, I turn to a brief re-\nview of the economic policy contrasts between China and Japan. \n In Japan, the new Meiji leaders who came to power in 1868 em-\nbarked on a comprehensive reform program to forge a modern nation-\nstate modeled after the West. Although the Meiji government initially \nengaged in a series of government-sponsored enterprises, their liquida-\ntion by the 1880s signaled a decisive switch of its policy away from di-\nrect engagements towards indirect support for the private sector. The \ngovernment engaged in the building-up of critical public infrastructure \nsuch as railroads and telegraphs, the establishment of a modern educa-\ntion system, the drafting of the commercial code in the 1880s, and the \nfounding of the Bank of Japan in 1882. The 1880s marked the begin-\nning of Japan\u2019s full-scale industrialization.33\n In comparison, the late-Qing government in China under the era of \nTongzhi Restoration (1862\u20131874) aimed to restore the traditional econ-\nomy from the Taiping devastation. The limited reform carried out under \nthe banner of the Self-Strengthening Movement (1860\u20131894) erected a \nseries of government-financed or controlled Western-style, capital-\n32 See Furuta, \u201cKobe\u201d; and Sugihara, Japan, p. 6.\n33 See Smith, Political Change, and Ishii, Nihon. During the Meiji period, Japanese per capita \nGDP grew at an annual 2.25 percent between 1887 and 1897, raising her share of manufacturing \nand mining in total GDP rising from 8.7 percent to 11 percent and 16 percent respectively dur-\ning the same period, see Ohkawa, Growth Rate, p. 278. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 371 \nintensive industrial and military enterprises in a largely agrarian setting. \nWhile these high-profile government-sponsored enterprises were \nfraught with corruption and inefficiencies, the much more deleterious \nimpact of late-Qing economic structure fell on the development of a \nmodern private sector.34\n Detailed case studies reveal that attempts to set up modern factories \nin sectors such as cotton and silk (that were to form the core of early-\ntwentieth-century industrialization) met serious resistance even within \nthe treaty port. Similar obstacles confronted the building of key public \ninfrastructures such as modern railroads and steam shipping in inland \nwaters in the nineteenth century.35 This critical policy difference to-\nwards private sector and public infrastructure held the key to explaining \nthe divergent paths of industrialization between China and Japan.36\nThe 1894\u20131896 naval confrontation between China and Japan be-\ncame a turning point when the fruits of these two modernization pro-\ngrams were put to test. The much bigger guns and battleships of the \nChinese Northern Fleet built under the Self-Strengthening Movement \nsuffered humiliating loss at the hands of a smaller but more disciplined \nJapanese navy, supported by a modern economic infrastructure built up \nduring the Meiji era: railroads and steam ships that mobilized troops, a \nbanking system and a bond market that supported war finance.37\nChina\u2019s defeat by a nation long regarded as her former student brought \na profound mental shock, which spelled the end of the Self-Strengthening \nMovement and opened the path towards the late-Qing constitutional re-\nform in 1903\u20131911 modeled directly on Japan\u2019s Meiji reform.38 The con-\nstitutional reform recognized the centrality of the private sector to a mar-\nket economy and paved the way for the introduction of modern public \n34 For the Tongzhi Restoration, see Mary Wright, Last Stand. For the Self-Strengthening \nMovement, see chapters 9 and 10 in Fairbank, ed., Cambridge History of China, vol. 10.  \n35 The obstacles to Chinese industrialization are multi-fold. One mechanism of these obsta-\ncles works through a merchant-bureaucratic power nexus strengthened by the imposition of likin\ntax\u2014a form of domestic transit tax levied in the wake of the Taiping rebellion. The govern-\nment\u2019s need for tax revenue but inability to collect gave rise to tax farming controlled by the \nmerchant guilds. Modern private industrial enterprises faced fierce opposition from both the lo-\ncal guilds and government. These oppositions also threatened modern Chinese enterprises often \nfalsely registered under Western ownership and located within the treaty port, as by treaty regu-\nlations, Western business were only allowed to set up commercial establishments but not manu-\nfacturing enterprises. See Suzuki, Yomu Undou; Motono, Conflict; and Debin Ma, \u201cBetween \nCottage.\u201d \n36 This is a point emphatically made by scholars on modern Japan. See Ishii, Nihon, chapter \n2; Suzuki, Yomu Undou, introduction; and Smith, Political Change, p. 23. \n37 For the Japanese economic infrastructure for war support, see Ishii, Nihon, pp. 99\u2013108. \n38 Military and strategic blunders rather than economic strengths may have accounted for the \noutcome of the naval warfare. For an argument that China\u2019s military defeat led to an excessively \nnegative assessment of the Self-Strengthening Movement and construction of Chinese back-\nwardness, see Benjamin Elman, On Their Own Terms, pp. 379\u201382 and 392\u201393.  \n372 Ma\ninfrastructure.39 But the immediate economic impact of the defeat was the \nsigning of the treaty of Shimonoseki in 1896 that granted foreigners the \nright to establish factories in the treaty port, lifting the floodgate of for-\neign direct investment in China and indirectly legitimizing Chinese mod-\nern enterprises. These dramatic turns of events around the turn of the cen-\ntury set off the first major wave of Chinese industrialization. \n The Late-Qing constitutional reform was as short-lived as the final \nyears of the empire, which collapsed in 1911. The new Republican re-\ngime, following the death of its first dictatorial ruler, Yuan Shikai in \n1916, was politically weak and fiscally insolvent. National disintegration \nand civil strife became the norm in the two decades of warlordism after \n1916. According to James Sheridan, warlords often brought terror and \nexploitation. \u201c[Their] demand for money was insatiable and the milita-\nrists wrung an astonishing array of taxes from the population. They \nprinted worthless currency on a large scale. . . . In many areas, the actions \nof organized crimes were less serious than the hordes of uncontrolled \nsoldiers who roamed the countryside preying on the peasantry.\u201d40\n According to one estimate, there were some 140 wars fought among a \ntotal of more than 1,300 rival militarists between 1911 and 1928.41 In \nthe Lower Yangzi, the least war-torn area, the war between the rival Ji-\nangsu and Zhejiang warlords in 1924 led to massive forced requisition-\ning of civilian personnel and services, confiscation of private properties, \nextortion of merchants and businesses, and severe disruptions of pro-\nduction and trade, inflicting total economic losses estimated between \nfour and five hundred million yuan.42\n The extent of warlord damage to the Chinese economy is disputed by \nRawski who points to the limited scale and duration of warfare. Further-\nmore, there were enlightened and stable warlords such as Yan Xishan and \nFeng Yuxiang who promoted economic reforms in the territories under \ntheir rule. The logic of Chinese warlord politics inspired Mancur Olson\u2019s \nclassic distinction between stationary bandits\u2014those with long-tenure \nrule and thus less predatory\u2014and roving bandits\u2014those with short time \nhorizon and consequently more destructive.43 Overall, despite the reas-\nsessment of the warlord era, Rawski agrees that \u201cpolitical unrest and civil \nwars made any long-range investment extremely precarious.\u201d44\n39 See Douglas Reynolds, China; and William Kirby \u201cChina Unincorporated.\u201d \n40 Sheridan, \u201cWarlord Era,\u201d p. 318. \n41 Phil Billingsley, Bandits, p. 24. \n42 Feng Youcai, Zaishang, p. 160.  \n43 Olson, \u201cDictatorship,\u201d p. 568. \n44 See Rawski, Economic Growth, p. 47 and chapter 1, for his argument about local rulers of-\nten promoting economic development. Also see Sheridan, \u201cWarlord Era\u201d (p. 317, footnote 35) \nfor a criticism of Rawski\u2019s assessment. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 373 \n How did and could industrialization take root in an era of widespread \nabuse of property rights and pervasive political uncertainty during the \nRepublican era? For that, we turn to a new political entity in the Lower \nYangzi: the treaty port of Shanghai ruled by Western business elites. \nThe Rise of the City \n Shanghai, once a market town peripheral to the city of Suzhou in the \ntraditional Lower Yangzi, was opened as a designated treaty port in \n1842. As a treaty port, Shanghai was under separate jurisdictions of \nBritish, French, and American Concessions as well as Chinese quarters. \nIn 1863 the British concession merged with the American quarters to \nform the International Settlement for all Western (and later Japanese) \nresidents. Following the massive influx of Chinese refugees during the \nTaiping rebellion, Chinese residents quickly formed the majority of the \nSettlement residents. \n The Settlement operated with its own mini-Constitution: the Shang-\nhai Land Regulations signed in 1854 and subsequently revised and ap-\nproved in 1866. It organized a Municipal Council whose members were \nelected by the rate-payers association consisting of tax-paying Western \nand later Japanese residents in the Settlement. Judicial powers over for-\neign residents were, under the grant of extraterritoriality, vested in the \nConsular Courts of the foreigners concerned, or, in the case of unrepre-\nsented foreigners or Chinese, in the International Mixed Court. This in-\nstitutional structure placed the Settlement on a foundation of limited \npower and rule of law.45\n The Municipal Council levied land and property taxes and business \nlicense fees, ran its own prison and police squad with the additional \nsupport of a volunteer army in times of need. In comparison with the \nChinese quarter governed by the local Qing government, the business-\ndominated council was far more efficient in the provision of public \ngoods (or semi-public goods) including the maintenance and improve-\nment of city roads, transportation and communication infrastructures, \npublic utilities, and port facilities.46\n45 The Municipal Council had a right to sue in these courts, and could in turn be sued in a \ncourt elected from the Consuls of the Treaty Powers, known as the Court of Consuls. As a gen-\neral rule, the council could make no arrests except on a warrant from the proper court. See Pott, \nShort History, p. 114; and Yang, Xiangjun, Diguo, chapter 2.  \n46 In 1926 the military warlord governing the Jiangsu province Sun Chuan-fang remarked: \n\u201c. . . whenever I come to a treaty port I feel thoroughly humiliated, not only because a treaty \nport is a standing reminder of our loss of sovereignty, but also because whenever we pass from \nthe concessions into Chinese territory we feel that we are crossing into a different world\u2014the \nformer is the upper and the latter is the under-world, for nothing in the Chinese territory\u2014roads, \n374 Ma\n This governance structure of the Settlement is reminiscent of the Me-\ndieval European political tradition where incorporated urban communi-\nties practiced self-rule under merchant elites or oligarchies often with \ncharters granted by larger territorial rulers. From its very early days, the \nWestern merchant elites of the Settlement had desired and fought for \nself-rule. This is an institutional feature that distinguished the Settle-\nment from most other treaty ports in China or even the neighboring \nFrench Concession, which had been under the administrative rule of the \nFrench consular officials appointed from Paris.47\nIn the wake of the dynastic collapse in China in 1911, the International \nSettlement and the French Concession realized their greatest territorial \nexpansion to reach 33 square kilometers, 1.5 times the total size of for-\neign concessions in the other 23 treaty ports in China.48 When the Qing \nmagistrate in Shanghai absconded\u2014allegedly with public funds\u2014during \nthe 1911 revolution, the International Settlement took over the Mixed \nCourt and began to appoint its own Chinese personnel. By then, the Set-\ntlement became a de-facto city-state with full territorial jurisdiction over \nits residents, Western and Chinese. This is the second institutional feature \nthat set it apart from the rest of foreign concessions in China. \n Thomas Stephens\u2019s study of the Mixed Court in 1911\u20131925 led him \nto emphatically state that \u201cthroughout all the political vicissitudes of the \nYuan Shikai era . . . , throughout all the marching and countermarching \nof the armies of the warlords and their murdering marauding hordes, . . .  \nShanghai became an oasis of peace, order and good government in a \nChina torn into convulsions by revolution, banditry and civil war.\u201d49\nThe 1911\u20131925 period saw the transformation of Shanghai into a truly \nindustrial city and ushered in what Marie-Claire Bergere hailed as the \ngolden age of Chinese bourgeoisie.50\nbuildings, or public health\u2014can be compared with the concessions. . . .\u201d quoted in Feetham, \nReport, vol. 1, p. 242.  \n47 Needless to say, the International Settlement was never officially recognized as an inde-\npendent political entity by the Chinese government. For a recent exposition of the city-state tra-\ndition in Western Europe, see S. R. Epstein, Freedom. For the difference between the Interna-\ntional Settlement and French Concession political systems, see Marie-Claire Bergere, Shanghai,\nchapter 5.  \n48 See Fei Chenkang, Zhongguo; and Bergere, Shanghai, p. 96. \n49 Stephens, Order, pp. 104\u201306 \n50 For the role of the Mixed Court in the 1916 Bank note suspension incident, which was a \nturning point when Shanghai emerged as China\u2019s sole financial center, see Chen, Banking,\npp. 53\u201359. For the new generation of Chinese industrial entrepreneurs in cotton textiles, flour \nmilling, matches, tobacco, machinery, and large-scale retail, see Bergere, Shanghai. Chinese \nownership share of modern industry was consistently higher than that of the foreigners in major \nsectors in Shanghai throughout the 1910s-1930s. This compares favorably with the share of in-\ndigenous entrepreneurship in Taiwan and Korea, or Manchuria under Japanese colonialism. \nCompare Xu and Huang, Shanghai, p. 341; with Mizoguchi and Umemura, Basic, p. 77. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 375 \n But beyond security and order, the institutional model of the Interna-\ntional Settlement had exerted a profound and lasting impact on political \norganization, legal regime of property rights and contract enforcement, \nfiscal structure, and civil society. It laid the political foundation for a \nlegendary Shanghai style of freewheeling capitalism characterized by \nfree trade, free capital, and banking with a small government but a large \ncivil society.51 The historical significance of the International Settle-\nment is eloquently captured by Justice Richard Feetham, the judge \ncalled upon to review the legal status of the Settlement in the 1930s: \nThe great piles of banks, offices and warehouses along the Bund [the financial \nhub of Shanghai], as seen from the deck of an ocean liner steaming up the river, \nare at once recognized by the newcomer as evidence of the wealth and enterprise \nof Shanghai, and of the belief which its merchants and citizens have in its future. \nBut they have a deeper economic significance than this; they are the first con-\nspicuous signs and symbols of the sanctity of the rights of private property, as \nrecognized and safeguarded in the [International] Settlement, and of the far-\nreaching confidence which this condition of things has inspired.52\n The political power of the city-state spread beyond the Settlement. In \nthe warlord era, the political structure of Western Shanghai uniquely \nempowered the Chinese business class to defy the political center and \nwring concessions of peace from the warlord governments. The Lower \nYangzi became the least war-torn region in China\u2014avoiding major bat-\ntles at least before 1924\u2014partly thanks to the political mobilization of \nthe Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the majority of the  \nmembers of which were Jiang-Zhe natives with a huge stake in the re-\ngion\u2019s peace and order. The Shanghai capitalists also forged an intricate \nand sometimes treacherous alliance with the new Nationalist regime \nthat founded its capital in Nanjing (Jiangsu province) in 1927. The city, \nespecially its Chinese financial elites, helped shape the new empire\u2014\nthe Nationalist regime\u2014in the formulation of a comprehensive national \neconomic policy which included the restoration of tariff autonomy, \nmodernization of China\u2019s public finance and monetary regime.53\n51 For a discussion and literature on the institutional influence of the International Settlement \non China and Lower Yangzi, see Debin Ma, \u201cShanghai-based Industrialization.\u201d See Ramon \nMyers, Chinese Economy, pp. 138\u201340, for an argument linking the role of treaty ports (or what \nhe termed as mini-Hong Kongs) as centers of free trade and finance to promote national growth \nin the Republican era. \n52 Richard Feetham, Report, vol. 1, p. 317. \n53 See Feng, Zaishan, pp. 136\u201339 for the role of Shanghai capitalists in the Warlord Era.

The Municipal Council\u2019s systematic practice of political exclu-\nsion and racial discrimination had turned Shanghai into a symbol of na-\ntional humiliation. The co-existence of three separate jurisdictions in a \ntight and open space created a fertile ground for political agitation and \norganized crime.54 The political autonomy of colonial Shanghai was \nswept away by the full-scale Japanese invasion in 1941, followed by the \narrival of the Communist troops in 1949, which returned China to inter-\nnational isolation. \n Shanghai capitalists\u2019 massive exodus to colonial Hong Kong, brought \nthat city capital, industrial skills, entrepreneurial vision, and (as recog-\nnized by the Hong Kong government) a 10\u201315 year head-start in indus-\ntrialization over many other Asian countries.55 China\u2019s emergence out \nof isolation in the late 1970s saw the resurgence of Shanghai and the \nLower Yangzi. Although economic growth during China\u2019s reform era \noccurred in a different institutional context, a historical shadow of old \nShanghai capitalism loomed in contemporary Chinese reform: the in-\ncreased role of foreign direct investment, the policy experimentation \nwith \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d and the preservation of Hong Kong\u2019s \nautonomy under the \u201cone country two systems\u201d framework.56\n Table 4 links my 1910s and 1930s regional per capita GDP to the \npost\u2013World War II data in a comparative East Asian framework (with \nthe usual caveats against the hazards of cross-country comparison). \nNote that the relative rankings of per capita income in 1952 largely mir-\nrored those of the 1930s (with Northeast China, formerly Manchuria, \nbeing the only exception).57 While the gap between Jiang-Zhe and \nChina remains unchanged in 1978, China\u2019s overall standing in per cap-\nita GDP had fallen far behind those market economies of her East Asian \nneighbors after two decades of isolation and command economies. Two \n54 The property requirement for voting rights ruled out 80 and 90 percent of the Western resi-\ndents, leaving the Municipal Council in the hands of a tiny and powerful business elite, dubbed \nas the \u201cTaipan Oligarchy\u201d (see Bergere, Shanghai, p. 98). The council refused, until 1928, any \nrepresentation of Chinese residents, who constituted 96 percent of the population and were the \nlargest tax revenue contributors in 1925, and denied Chinese residents access to Municipal fa-\ncilities such as \u201cpublic parks\u201d (see Feetham, Report, vol. 1, pp. 138\u201346).

The narrative structures this growth in the \nlarger historical context and highlights political and institutional \nchanges as the most important determinants to both the timing and pat-\ntern of industrialization in China and East Asia during the late nine-\nteenth through early twentieth centuries. In particular, it emphasizes \nthe importance of a new political entity, the International Settlement in \nShanghai, that supplied public order and protected private property \nrights in an era of national disintegration and civil strife. The political \nstructure of a city-state forged a legendary Shanghai style of free-\nwheeling capitalism, a model that stood apart from the acclaimed East \nAsian model of state-led industrialization in postwar Japan and Korea. \nNonetheless, weighed down by its colonial stigma and narrow interest, \nthe city-state model of the Shanghai International Settlement is neither \nsustainable nor replicable. \n378 Ma\n The tortuous path of Chinese industrialization in the nineteenth \nthrough twentieth centuries questions the fundamental compatibility of \nits traditional institutions with modern economic growth. While this call \nforth a larger research agenda, this article draws attention to potential \nmethodological problems inherent in comparative studies that pair eco-\nnomic regions with independent nation states. Situated within the politi-\ncal structure of a centralized empire, economic regions such as the \nLower Yangzi encountered constraints to institutional change far more \nsevere than would independent nation-states such as Britain or Japan. \nAs shown above, the rise of Shanghai first as a trading port in the latter \nhalf of the nineteenth century and then as an industrial metropolis was \nlargely determined in the large context of political changes in the Chi-\nnese empire. Within China\u2019s centralized power structure, elements for \nchange from the bottom were perennially short of political space and of-\nten survived precariously at the empire\u2019s fringe. It is no surprise that in-\nstitutional breakthroughs in modern East Asia came from new political \nstructures created outside the empire: the rise of a nation-state of Meiji \nJapan after 1868 and the formation of a breakaway city of Shanghai af-\nter the turn of the twentieth century. \n The lessons on the diffusion of the Industrial Revolution in East Asia \nalso shed light on the ongoing debate on the origin of the Industrial \nRevolution. The absence of coal deposits in the Lower Yangzi, as em-\nphasized by Pomeranz for the eighteenth century, did not become a ma-\njor constraint to Shanghai-based industrialization. Shanghai industriali-\nzation, as noted by Rhodes Murphey, was an anomaly by Western \nstandards, characterized by a local absence of most of the essential ma-\nterials for manufacturing, especially coal. In the mid-nineteenth century \nwhen the city was opened as a treaty port, coal arrived from faraway \nEngland, then from Japan during the late nineteenth century, and finally \nfrom North China in the twentieth century following the completion of \nrailroads.58\n Similarly, the much-written-about favorable geography of Shang-\nhai\u2014its central position on the coast of East Asia and the Lower \nYangzi hinterland\u2014seems more the endogenous outcome of geo-\npolitical changes as acutely observed by one Chinese resident of the \nInternational Settlement: \nThat this place was chosen as the \u201cSettlement\u201d precisely shows these (Western) \nbarbarians have a vision. It is a global vision. Within the shooting range of \n(Western) military gunboats on the Huangpu river, the Settlement came under \n58 See Murphey, Shanghai, pp. 184\u201395.

From a closed perspective, this is a \npiece of muddy swamp with little value other than some defense against enemies \nfrom outside the city wall. But from an open perspective, this is the point of en-\ntry to China\u2019s richest region and the departure to the world.59\nAppendix: Net Domestic Product by Sector of \nOrigin for China and the Jiang-Zhe Provinces \nin 1933\nAGRICULTURE \n The agricultural share of the Jiang-Zhe province is calculated through two steps. \nThe first step is to use the provincial level data (1931\u20131937 averages) in the Crop Re-\nports published by the National Agricultural Research Bureau (NARB) added with the \nManchurian output data to calculate the Jiang-Zhe share in physical units for each \ncommodity. The results are presented in columns A through E of Appendix Table 1. \nThe second step is to multiply the 1933 unit prices of each agricultural commodity by \nthe 1933 agricultural output in physical units to arrive at a total agricultural gross \nvalue for China. This Chinese agricultural output value is then multiplied by the Jiang-\nZhe share to arrive at the Jiang-Zhe agricultural gross output value in column C. The \nfinal share of Jiang-Zhe provinces in agricultural value-added is then calculated as the \nratio of Jiang-Zhe gross value to that of China shown as 0.148 in column H. \n Note that the Jiang-Zhe share in physical output units is calculated based on the \n1931\u20131937 averages, but the Jiang-zhe share in gross value for 1933 is based on Liu \nand Yeh price and output data, Economy, p. 140. Their gross value for Chinese agri-\nculture in 1933 amounts to 21,170 million yuan (p. 140). Because the gross value of \nChinese agricultural products covered in this study sums to 14,110.77 million yuan \n(column F), this indicates the coverage of products included in this study amounts to \n67 percent of the total agricultural gross output for China. \nMODERN FACTORY \n The coverage of modern factory output is the most complete thanks to the 1933 sur-\nvey conducted under the able leadership of D. K. Lieu. However, the survey covered \nonly the so-called \u201cChina Proper,\u201d which is equivalent to the current Chinese territory \nbut without the Japanese-controlled Manchuria, roughly equivalent to today\u2019s North-\neast provinces of Heilongjiang, Changchun, and Jilin. From Appendix Table 2, I de-\nrive the Jiang-Zhe Share of China Proper as 0.663. Then I calculate the Japanese con-\ntrolled Manchuria share of 0.166 in China Proper from Liu and Yeh\u2019s estimate. These \ntwo results enable me to calculate the Jiang-Zhe share of China total (including Man-\nchuria) as 0.569.  \n A new estimate by Kubo and Makino gives a higher Manchuria share of China \nProper\u2019s industrial output at 0.266 (table 13, p. 41). Using their estimates would have \na negligible impact on my result (Jiang-Zhe share of modern industry would be 0.549 \n59 Huangpu is the major river that crosses Shanghai.

K. Lieu\u2019s survey is summarized in Kubo and \nMakino, table 2, p. 29. Makino and Kubo\u2019s table also listed provincial level industrial output \ndata from Vol. 2 of Lieu\u2019s survey. Vol. 2 data would give the Jiang-Zhe a higher share of 0.596 \nin China\u2019s total (including Manchuria). I have opted for the vol. 3 figure because it had a wider \ncoverage of factories than vol. 2. The gross industrial output estimate by Liu and Yeh is from \nEconomy, p. 428, table F-1. \nUnfortunately, there is no solid provincial-level data for most other handicraft \nproducts including some of the most important items such as flour and rice milling, \ncotton and silk goods, or oil products. I make rough estimates of these shares based \non a variety of sources with different cross-checks. In particular, as most of these \nhandicraft productions are highly localized, agricultural sideline activities, I use \nprovincial shares of agricultural raw materials as proxies for shares of handicraft \noutput. In Appendix Table 3, columns A through E derive the Jiang-Zhe shares of \neach of these 19 items. Then I multiply this Jiang-Zhe share to the total Chinese \nNet Value-added (NVD) to derive the Jiang-Zhe NVD in column G. China Net \nValue-added in column F is from Ou et al, Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 1, pp. \n65\u201366. The final Jiang-Zhe share in national handicraft NVD is 0.21. This ratio \nmatches surprisingly well with a government survey in 1936 showing that the Ji-\nang-Zhe share in total agricultural by-products is 0.22 (cited in Wang Jin-yu, Jindai \nZhongguo Zhiben Zhuyi, p. 101). \n Note that as the total net value added of China\u2019s handicraft product amounts to \n1,340,078 thousand yuan (Ou et al, Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 1, p. 66), the 19 \nproducts included here (with total net value added summed to 796,823) would con-\nstitute about 60 percent of total handicraft NVD in China. \n382 Ma\nAPPENDIX TABLE 3\nJIANG-ZHE PROVINCES HANDICRAFT NET VALUE-ADDED FOR THE 1930S\nGross Output Value (1,000 yuan) \nJiangsu\nA\nZhejiang\nB\nShanghai\nC\nChina\nD\nJiang-Zhe\nShare \nChina\nNVD\n(1,000\nyuan) \nJiang-Zhe\nNVD\n1.

As traditional oil processing was highly localized, I use share of raw agri-\ncultural materials to gauge Jiang-Zhe\u2019s share of edible oil products in national output. The two \nmost important oil items are soybean and peanut oil. Jiang-zhe share in soybeans production in \nnational agricultural output is 0.14. Perkins\u2019s book, Agricultural Development, provides provin-\ncial-level acreage statistics for soybeans, rapeseed, sesame, peanuts, and cotton (for cotton oil) \n(pp. 258\u201361). The Jiang-Zhe shares of acreage in these five items are 0.11, 0.13, 0.11, 0.09 and \n0.21. I give an overall Jiang-Zhe share of 0.12 for oil products. \n14. Cotton-spinning: there is no provincial level hand-spun cotton yarn data. It is however rea-\nsonable to assume a close geographical relationship between local cotton cultivation and hand-\nspun cotton yarn production. So I use 0.26, which is the Jiang-Zhe share of raw cotton produc-\ntion to proxy for its share of hand-spun yarn. \n15. Cotton-weaving; there is no provincial level hand-woven cotton cloth data. I the 0.26 Jiang-\nZhe share of cotton production in national total as a proxy for its share of hand-woven cloth \noutput with the following two independent cross-checks:  \n Xu Xinwu, Jiangnan Tubushi, p. 215, shows that the Jiangsu share of hand-woven cloth out-\nput amount to 27 percent of the national total around 1860. \n Yan Zhong-ping, Zhongguo Miafang Zhi Shigao, pp. 241\u201351, provides a survey of regional \ndistribution of hand-weaving production in selected provinces in China. The relative importance \nacross difference provinces in hand-weaving production ranked in his survey matches the rank-\ning in provincial-level cotton acreage statistics for 1931\u20131937 listed in Perkins\u2019s data, Agricul-\ntural Development, p. 261, with Hebei province having the highest output, followed by Shan-\ndong and Jiangsu. This is a confirmation of the relationship between local cotton cultivation and \nhand-weaving production. Both these two cross-checks are far from perfect, but they offer sup-\nport that the 0.26 share I chose is possibly within reasonable bounds of accuracy. \n16. Silk-reeling: using data compiled by Japanese scholar Shigemi Uehara, Ou et al., Zhongguo\nGuomin Suode, vol. 2, pp. 102\u201303, shows that total raw silk output figures (both machine and \nhand-reeled) for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and China proper (excluding the Japanese occupied Man-\nchuria) were 36,405, 106,230 and 300,788 piculs respectively for 1927. Ou et al., ibid., p. 102, \nshows the total raw silk output for both China total (including Manchuria) and Manchuria as \nwell as prices for Zhejiang and Manchuria raw silk in 1933. Based on this, I calculate the Man-\nchuria share in China\u2019s total gross output value as 18 percent. From this, I derive the Jiang-Zhe \nshare in China\u2019s total raw silk output as equal to 0.40 [= (36,405 + 106,230) \/ (300,788 * 1.18)]. \nTo calculate the Jiang-Zhe share in hand-reeled raw silk, I use the information (Ou et al., ibid., \np. 102) that machine-reeled raw silk was about 41 percent of total raw silk output and the Jiang-\nZhe share of machine-reeled raw silk output was 65 percent of China (ibid., p. 101, table 5) to \nderive the ratio of 0.23 [ = (0.40 \u2013 0.41 * 0.65) \/ (1 \u2013 0.41)] for Jiang-Zhe share of hand-reeled \nraw silk in China\u2019s total.  \n17. Silk-weaving: the Lower Yangzi region has traditionally been the premium producing re-\ngion. Ou et al, ibid., p. 104, shows that the Jiang-Zhe share of machine-woven silk goods \namounts to more than 70 percent of the national total. Clearly, the Jiang-Zhe share of hand-\nwoven silk products would not be as dominant but could be higher than its 0.23 share for hand-\nreeled raw silk. I choose 0.35 as the final share for Jiang-Zhe share.  \n18. Flour-milling: I use the Jiang-Zhe share of wheat output, 0.16, for its share of handicraft \nflouring milling in China. \n19. Rice-milling: Ou et al., ibid., p. 126, shows the Jiang-Zhe share in rice milled in modern fac-\ntories is 0.28 of the national total. However, rice output in Jiang-Zhe is equal to 0.16 of the na-\ntional total. As Jiang-Zhe provinces have long been rice-deficit region and rice imported from \nother regions are likely go through additional milling, I give 0.22 for the Jiang-Zhe share. \n384 Ma\nAPPENDIX TABLE 4\nTOTAL CAPITAL OF NATIVE BANKS (QIANZHANG AND NINHAO) AND  \nPAWN SHOPS \n(in yuan) \n Total Capita of Native Banks \n(Qianzhang and Ninhao Capital\n Total Capital of \nPawn Shops \nJiangsu 25,603,000  13,393,749 \nZhejiang 8,567,400  19,364,758 \nChina total  121,836,207  63,898,586\nJiang-Zhe share  0.28 0.51\nSource: Ou et al., Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 2, p. 275, for native banks and p. 276 for pawn \nshops.\nTHE SERVICE SECTOR \nFinance \n For finance, one estimate claims that Shanghai`s total capital including deposits, \nconvertible notes and retained earnings of banks, Native Banks (Qiangzhong), Trust \nCorp. was about 47.8 percent of China in 1936 (Zhang, Zhong-Li, Jindai Shanghai \nChengshi Yanjiu, p. 313). Rawski, Economic Growth, estimates that deposits of native \nbanks in Shanghai account for 30 percent of the national total in 1935 (p. 390). Ou et \nal., Zhongguo Guomin Suode, also provides some provincial level figures for native \nbanks and pawn shops as follows. It is not very clear whether Ou et al.\u2019s data of native \nbanks and pawn shops included Shanghai. In my estimate, I use a 48 percent share of \nthe national total for Shanghai and add another 17 percent for Jiangsu and Zhejiang \nprovinces to sum up to 0.65 for the Jiang-Zhe share of financial services. See Appen-\ndix Table 4.\nUtilities\n The utilities share of Jiang-Zhe, 0.57, is calculated as the average of water, electricity and gas \nweighted by the gross value of each sector in China\u2019s total output. The steps of calculation are \nshown in Appendix Table 5. \nModern Transportation and Communication \n Appendix Table 6 presents both China\u2019s gross value output of transportation and \ncommunication services for seven sectors from Liu and Yeh, Economy, p. 590. The \nderivation of Jiang-Zhe share in national total for these seven sectors is presented in \nthe detailed footnotes to Appendix Table 6. Multiplying these individual sectoral \nshares with the weights derived from the gross value output, I obtain the sectoral share \nweighted Lower Yangzi share of 21 percent in the national total. \nTrade (Commerce) \n Ou et al.\u2019s calculation (Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 2, pp. 247\u201358) is based on the \ntotal number of retail stores and restaurants and the peddlers.

Ou et al.\u2019s book does not have separate provincial level \ndata for electricity. I use his gross value data (ibid., vol. 2, p. 70) and calculate from Shenbao \nNianjian (p. 569) the share of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China\u2019s total as equal to 0.46. As the \nShenbao figure does not include electricity generated by factories, I round the figure up to 0.5.  \ntimes that of China. Multiplying 2.7 to 0.12 (the L.Y. population share) gives 32 percent \nfor the L.Y. share.  \n For peddlers, there is no good national survey. Ou et al.\u2019s calculation is based \nlargely on the Jiangsu data (Ou et al., Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 1, pp. 107\u201308). I \njust assume here the Jiang-Zhe share here is equal to its population share of 0.12. Av-\neraging the two sums by value added weights gives a final Jiang-Zhe share of 28 per-\ncent (the value-added weights for stores and peddlers are 0.79 and 0.21 respectively, \nOu et al., Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 1, pp. 106 and 107).  \nGovernment Administration \n Appendix 6 in Ou et al., Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 2, pp. 277\u201396, has provin-\ncial level government administration expenses for counties, provinces, central gov-\nernment, and foreign concessions. Appendix Table 7 shows that government admini-\nstration expenses (excluding the central government) in Jiang-Zhe are about 11 \npercent of the total. With the capital located in Nanjing city, I round the Jiang-Zhe \nshare to be 12 percent. The central government expenses are equal to 484,525,780 \nwith almost three-fourth of it spent on military expenditures (p. 294).  \nConstruction \n For Construction, Ou et al. defined it as the building and repair of residential and \nbusiness housing, factories, canals and rivers, railroads, roads, ports, and transporta-\ntion infrastructure (Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 1, p. 77). Unfortunately, there were \nno provincial-level data in Ou et al.\u2019s volume. The national data was based on the \namount of construction materials used such as stone, cement, lime, bricks, iron and \nsteel, and lumber. Considering the Jiang-Zhe provinces had a share of 57 percent in \nmodern factories and 21 percent in handicraft production, the products of which corre-\nlate highly with these construction materials, I assign a rather conservative share of \n30 percent for construction in the Jiang-Zhe provinces.  \n386 Ma\nAPPENDIX TABLE 6\nGROSS VALUE OUTPUT \n(million yuans) \n  Railroad  Shipping\nTrucks, Taxis, \nand Buses Trolleys Air\nCommuni-\ncations\nPostal \nServices  Total \nChina Gross \noutput\n 369  137 95 13 4 44 46  708 \nJiang-Zhe\nshare \n 0.12  0.25 0.46 0.57 0 0.3 0.33 0.21\nNotes: For railroads, Ou et al. (Zhongguo Guomin Suode, vol. 2. table 3, p. 189) has gross in-\ncome for all the railroads. The share of Jiang-Zhe in the national railway income is about 14 \npercent. However, some of the railroads covered mileage outside Jiang-Zhe. In this case, I give \n12 percent for the Jiang-Zhe share to equalize it with its population share.\n For shipping, I used the number of junks (Minchuan) in Jiang-Zhe as a proxy for their gross \nvalue. Jiang-Zhe had about a 22 percent share (Ou et al, ibid., p.181). For steam ships, I used \ngross receipts of shipping companies located in the Jiang-Zhe. There were two major shipping \ncompanies (Minshen and Zaosanqu) which plied the entire Lower Yangzi river but with a sig-\nnificant share in Jiang-Zhe. Including them in Jiang-Zhe would give a Jiang-Zhe share of 55 \npercent and excluding them would yield 28 percent, I take the intermediate number 40 percent \n(Ou et al., ibid., pp. 176\u201377). Averaging the ships and boats using their weights in total net \nvalue added gives a Jiang-Zhe share of 0.25 (weights equal to 0.86 for native boats and 0.14 for \nmodern ships, calculated from Ou et al., vol.2, table 9, p.185).  \n For trucks, taxis, buses, I used the number of vehicles in the Jiang-Zhe provinces as a proxy \nfor the share which is 46 percent (Ou et al., ibid., p. 202).  \n For Trolleys in the Jiang-Zhe provinces, they were only operating in Shanghai whose net in-\ncome was about 57 percent of the national total (Ou et al., ibid., p. 202).  \n Air was very small. I just assumed it to be zero for Jiang-Zhe.  \n For modern communication, I calculate the NVD share of the Jiang-Zhe provinces for the two \nlargest items, local phone and wire telegraph. They add up to over 70 percent of the net income \nfor modern communication (Ou et al., ibid., table 18, p. 241). For local phone, the Jiang-Zhe \nshare is 36 percent in gross income (Ou et al., ibid., table 10, p. 235) and for wire telegraph, the \nshare is 24 percent (Ou et al., ibid., table 8, p. 232). The weighted average is 30 percent \n(weights for phone and telegraph are 0.39 and 0.61 respectively). Ou et al.\u2019s provincial data for \nphone and telegraph did not include Manchuria. I use Ou et al.\u2019s table 18 (ibid., p. 241) to calcu-\nlate Manchuria share being 28 percent. So the China total for both phone and telegraph in Ou et \nal.\u2019s data was multiplied by 1.28.  \n The Postal Services share for the Jiang-Zhe share in net income is calculated as 33 percent \n(Ou et al., ibid., table 2, p. 245).  \nOld-Fashioned Transportation, Personal Services, Residential Rents \n There are no regional data on these three sectors, I used 0.24, a number that is about \nthe simple average of Jiang-Zhe shares in trade and modern transportation communi-\ncation and twice the national per capita average. \nEconomic Growth in the Lower Yangzi 387 \nAPPENDIX TABLE 7\nGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES IN THE JIANG-ZHE PROVINCES \n(in yuan) \n  County Level  \nProvincial\nLevel \nForeign\nConcessions  Total \nJiangsu  23,484,538 11,908,006     \nZhejiang  10,748,913  11,080,321     \nHanzhou  846,816  773,510     \nNanjing   2,426,175     \nShanghai  7,735,110  28,623,516   \nJiang-Zhe  35,080,267  33,149,612  28,623,516  68,229,879\nChina  210,344,878  407,708,136  47,796,200  618,053,014\nJiang-Zhe share        0.11 \nSource: County- and provincial-level and foreign concessions data from Ou et al., Zhongguo \nGuomin Suode, vol. 2, pp. 287, 292, and 295, respectively.  \nREFERENCES\nBillingsley, Phil.
