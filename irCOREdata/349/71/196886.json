JBC 2006: 281, 39465-70). To extend these studies further we \nhave used phage-display to select single-chain Fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against different forms \nof the B-subunit. Two clones exhibiting strong and differential binding were chosen for detailed \ncharacterization. A comprehensive sequence analysis was performed to assign the framework and \ncomplementary-determining regions and a nonsense mutation present in one of these (scFv-B1.3.9) was \n \n \n2 \ncorrected. Binding analysis showed that scFv-B1.3.9 bound  in ELISA to both heat-denatured \nmonomeric B-subunits (EtxB1)  and also displayed cross-reactivity towards pentameric EtxB (EtxB5), \nalthough there was no reactivity towards monoganglioside (GM1) captured EtxB5. Another antibody (scFv-\nB5.2.14) had a different reactivity profile and, in ELISA, bound only to EtxB5 but not to EtxB1 or to EtxB5 \ncaptured via GM1. Surprisingly, in competition experiments, the assembled pentameric B-subunit inhibited \nbinding  of scFv-B5.2.14 to immobilized EtxB5 only weakly, whereas reduced, but not oxidized, \nmonomeric EtxB1 was an efficient competitor. These results clearly demonstrate that B1.3.9 and B5.2.14 \nhave different specificities for cryptic epitopes not accessible in the fully assembled GM1 bound \npentameric form of EtxB.  \nTaken together our results show that we were able to successfully isolate and characterize \nrecombinant scFvs that differentially recognize diverse denatured forms or assembly intermediates of the \nheat-labile enterotoxin B subunit of E. coli.  \n \nKEYWORDS  \n \nEtxB, epitope, protein assembly, differential \nrecognition, phage display, recombinant \nantibodies, scFvs  \n \nHeat-labile enterotoxin (Etx) produced by \ncertain strains of E. coli is a major virulence factor \nrelated to cholera toxin (Ctx) produced by Vibrio \ncholera and results in diarrhoeal disease in humans \nand animals (Hirst, 1995; Echeverria et al., 1985). \nHeat-labile enterotoxin consists of 5 identical B-\nsubunits (Mr = 12,000), which in vivo naturally \nassemble into a stable pentameric structure with an \nA-subunit (Mr = 28,000), which has ADP-ribosyl \ntransferase activity (Holmgren et al., 1975; \nFishman et al., 1978; Fishman et al., 1980). The B-\nsubunit pentamer of Etx (EtxB5) specifically \nrecognizes, and has a high affinity for, the \noligosaccharide portion of GM1 on the surface of \nintestinal cells and acts to deliver the A-subunit \n \n \n3 \nwhere it catalyses ADP-ribosylation of the signal \ntransduction protein Gs-\u03b1. By effectively blocking \ndeactivation of Gs-\u03b1 intracellular levels of cAMP \nrise, leading to fluid and Cl\n-\n loss from the cells and \nthus severe diarrhoea (Kuziemko et al., 1996; \nTurnbull et al., 2004).  \nIn addition to their roles as mediators of \ndiarrhoeal disease, Etx and Ctx have long been \nknown to be potent mucosal immunogens and, \nwhen co-administered with other antigens, can \ngive rise to strong tolerogenic responses (Weiner, \n1997). In addition, it has been shown that \nrecombinant preparations of EtxB5 affect \nimmunoregulatory processes and lead to the \nsuppression of inflammatory responses (Shevach, \n2000). The enterotoxins Etx and Ctx are highly \nrelated showing 80% sequence identity and \nstimulate strong mucosal immunity both to \nthemselves and to co-administered antigens \n(Yamamoto et al., 1987; Wilson et al., 1991; \nTakahashi et al., 1996). The ability of EtxB and \nCtxB to enhance TH2 and suppress TH1 \ninflammatory responses in an antigen-specific \nmanner has been subject to intensive research, \nparticularly in relation to the treatment of \nautoimmune disease (Williams et al., 1999; Sobel \net al., 1998; Luross et al., 2002). It was initially \nthought that the adjuvant properties of EtxB were \ndependent on receptor binding activity as a non-\nbinding point mutant of EtxB (G33D), lost all \nimmunomodulatory activity. However, the CtxB \nmutant, CtxB (H57A) was shown to retain the \nability to bind to GM1 but was unable to act as an \nimmunomodulator (Truitt et al., 1998; Williams et \nal., 1999; Aman et al., 2001; Fraser et al., 2003). It \nis now theorized that structural alterations in CtxB \n(H57A), while not preventing binding to GM1, may \npreclude interactions with additional co-receptors \nrequired for signaling (Fraser et al., 2003). \nTherefore, ganglioside recognition alone, while \nnecessary to achieve high-affinity binding to cell \nsurfaces, may not be sufficient to mediate the \nimmunomodulatory effects of the B subunits. \nPreviously we reported on the generation \nand characterization of mAbs specific for EtxB5 \n(LDS16) and EtxB1 (LDS47) and showed that \n \n \n4 \nthese could be used to study pentamer assembly in \nvitro and this has led us to propose a model \ndescribing the processes of pentamer assembly \n(Lesieur, 2002). However, investigating in vivo \ntoxin assembly and transport to the periplasmic \nspace using mAb probes is not possible using \nconventional monoclonal antibodies. In this study \nwe have selected scFvs that specifically react with \nintermediate forms of EtxB with the potential to be \nused to study pentamer assembly in vivo. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \nPhage display library and phage rescue \u2013 \nAntibodies against different forms of EtxB were \nselected from the semi-synthetic scFv phage \ndisplay library (a generous gift from Dr. Andrew \nGriffiths, MRC, Cambridge, UK). The VH and VL \nregions were re-cloned from the lox library vectors \ninto the phagemid pHEN2 (Griffiths et al., 1994) \nwhere the recombinant scFv genes are flanked by \nSfiI and NotI sites. Rescue of the library was \nperformed as recommended (Griffiths et al., 1994). \nBriefly, 10\n10\n CFU of the Griffin.1 library in \nbacterial strain TG1 were inoculated into 2xTY \nmedium containing 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 1% \nglucose. Cells were incubated\n \nat 37\u00b0C until the \nOD600 reached 0.5. Then 25 ml of this culture was \ninfected with 10\n10\n PFU of VCS-M13 helper phage \nand\n \nincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The infected \ncells were collected\n \nby centrifugation for 10 min at \n2,500 g and resuspended in 300\n \nml of 2xTY \ncontaining 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 25 \u00b5g\/ml \nkanamycin. Subsequently, the bacteria were\n \ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C with slow rotation \n(200 rpm). After centrifugation for 30 min at \n2,500 g the supernatant was collected and\n \nphages \nwere precipitated twice with 20% polyethylene \nglycol 6,000 and 2.5 M NaCl. The phage pellet \nwas resuspended in PBS to a final titer of 10\n12-13\n \nPFU\/ml. \nBiopanning \u2013 Nunc immunotubes \n(maxisorp\u00ae) were coated overnight with 4 ml of \nmonomeric and pentameric EtxB (10 \u00b5g\/ml) at \nroom temperature in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH \n9.6. After washing three times with PBS the tubes \n \n \n5 \nwere blocked with 2% milk in PBS and incubated\n \nat 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Phages (10\n12\n PFU) were diluted \ninto 4 ml of 2% dried milk powder in PBS and \nwere incubated for 30 min at room temperature \nwith slight agitation followed by 90 min at room \ntemperature without agitation. The tubes were \nthoroughly washed ten times with PBS containing \n0.1% Tween-20, and then ten times with PBS. \nPhages were eluted by 10 min incubation with \n1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine under slight \nagitation. The eluted phages were then \nimmediately neutralized with 0.2 ml of 1 M Tris \npH 7.4. The immuno-tubes were rinsed with 0.2 ml \n1 M Tris pH 7.4 to neutralize the remaining phages \nand 0.75 ml of the eluted phages were added to \n9.25 ml of an exponentially growing TG1 culture \n(OD600 of 0.6 to 0.8). In addition, 4 ml of this \nculture were added to the immuno-tube to collect \nany remaining phages. Both cultures were \nincubated for 30 minutes at 37 C in a water bath \nwithout shaking to allow infection. The cultures \nwere then pooled and serial dilutions were plated \non TYE containing 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 1% \nglucose for titer determination. The remaining \nculture was centrifuged at 3,300 g for 10 minutes \nand resuspended in 1ml of 2xTY and plated on a \nlarge Nunc Bio-Assay dish of TYE containing \n100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 1 % glucose. After \novernight incubation at 30\u00b0C, 5-6 ml of 2xTY and \n15% glycerol was added to the Bio-Assay dish and \nthe cells were suspended with a glass spreader. \nThe bacteria were then incubated in 2xTY medium \ncontaining ampicillin (100 \u00b5g\/ml) and 1% glucose \nat 37 C with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.5. \nSubsequent selection of primarily purified phages \nwas also done using Nunc immunotubes \n(maxisorp\u00ae) coated overnight with 4 ml of \nmonomeric and pentameric EtxB (10 \u00b5g\/ml) at \nroom temperature in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH \n9.6. \nPreparation of monoclonal phages \u2013  \nMonoclonal phages were prepared by inoculating \nindividual colonies from the TYE plates into \n100 \u00b5l of 2xTY containing 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin \nand 1% glucose in 96 well plates and grown at \n37 C overnight with shaking at 300 rpm. 2 \u00b5l of \n \n \n6 \neach well from this plate was transferred to a \nsecond 96-well plate containing 200 \u00b5l of 2xTY \nwith 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose per well \nand incubated at 37 C for 1 h. Then 25 \u00b5l 2xTY \ncontaining 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin, 1% glucose and \n10\n9\n PFU VCS-M13 helper phage was added to \neach well. After 90 min incubation at 37\u00b0C the \nplate was spun at (10 min at 1,800 g), the pellet \nwas resuspended in 200 \u00b5l 2xTY containing \n100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and 50 \u00b5g\/ml kanamycin and \nincubated overnight at 30 C with shaking. The \nplate was spun (10 min at 1,800 g) and 100 \u00b5l of \nthe supernatant was used in phage-ELISA. \nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays \u2013 \nThe production and purification of recombinant \npentameric B-subunit (EtxB5) has been described \npreviously (Amin et al., 1995).. For the GM1- EtxB \nELISA, microtiter plates (Immulon 1, Dynatech) \nwere coated with GM1-ganglioside (0.2 g\/ml) \novernight and 0.2 g\/ml EtxB5 in PBS was added \n1hr before the assay. Plates were blocked with 1% \nbovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibody binding \nto GM1 captured EtxB was detected using a goat \nanti-mouse-horse radish peroxidase conjugate \n(Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). \nFor direct binding experiments not \ninvolving the capture of EtxB5 by GM1. EtxB5 and \nEtxB1 (EtxB5 boiled for 5min) were coated directly \nonto the plates in PBS for 1hr at room temperature  \nand blocked with BSA buffer as above. To confirm \nthat plates were coated with EtxB5 or EtxB1  we \nused the monoclonal antibodies against pentamer \n(LDS16) and monomer (LDS47) as controls \n(Chung et al., 2006). An scFv against MBP was \nalso used as an internal positive control for the \ndetection system in ELISA (kindly provided by Dr. \nK. Gough, Department of Biology, University of \nLeicester (Gough et al., 1999)) although data for \nthis is not shown for reasons of clarity. For the \nphage-ELISA, 10 \u00b5l (about 10\n10\n PFU) of poly-\nethylene glycol-precipitated\n \npolyclonal phage \nantibodies from each round of selection (made up \nto 100 \u00b5l with blocking buffer) or 100 \u00b5l of culture \nsupernatant\n \nof super-infected TG1 cells containing \nmonoclonal phage antibodies\n \nwas applied to the \ncoated and blocked plates and incubated for \n \n \n7 \n90 min at room temperature. Plates were washed \nthree times with PBS containing\n \n0.05% Tween-\n20 and three times with PBS. Phages were detected\n \nby using the Detection Module Recombinant \nPhage Antibody System\n \n(Pharmacia, Uppsala, \nSweden) according to the manufacturer's\n \nrecommendations. \nTo test for secreted scFvs, E. coli \nsupernatants were applied to the coated and \nblocked plates and incubated for 1.5 h. Then the \nanti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, 1\/50 \ndilution of hybridoma supernatant) was added and \nincubated for 1.5 h followed by 1 h incubation \nwith goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to \nhorseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch \nLaboratories). The substrate reaction was carried \nout for 1 h in the dark. The reaction was stopped \nby addition of 1 M H2SO4 and the absorbance was \nmeasured at 450 nm. \nInhibition of scFv-B5.2.14 binding was \nanalyzed by first incubating EtxB1\/EtxB5 with \neither B5.2.14 (E. coli supernatant containing the \nsecreted scFv) or LDS16 (diluted 1\/50 in PBS) for \n1 h at room temperature before adding to the \nELISA plates directly coated with EtxB5 or GM1-\ncaptured EtxB5 and subsequently blocked with 1% \nmilk powder in PBS. The inhibition was calculated \nusing: \n \n)(\n)(\n1\ncompetitornoOD\ncompetitorOD\nI  \n \nFor quantification of the amount of EtxB5 bound to \nthe ELISA plates for each test sample, optical \ndensity readings corresponding to dilutions located \non the linear part of the curve were compared with \nthe dilution of an EtxB5 standard (1 \u00b5g\/ml, diluted \n2-fold), giving the same optical density reading. \nCorrection of the scFv-B1.3.9 gene \u2013 The \nnonsense mutation identified in the VH region of \nscFv-B1.3.9 was corrected by SOE-PCR using the \nprimers pSOEp1 (5' AAA TTC CAA GAC AGA \nGTC ACC ATT ACC AG 3'), pSOEp2 (5' GGT \nGAC TCT GTC TTG GAA TTT CTG TGC GTA \nGTT 3'), pGSRp3 (5' TCC GCC TGA ACC GCC \nTCC AC 3') and LMB3 (5' CAG GAA ACA GCT \nATG AC 3'). The SOE-PCR product was gel-\n \n \n8 \npurified and digested with SfiI and XhoI. The \ncorresponding region of pHEN2-scFv-B1.3.9 as \nexcised and the gel-purified vector-fragment (V-F) \nwas ligated to the digested SOE-PCR product. The \nligated product was transformed into electro-\ncompetent XL1-blue cells. Ampicillin-resistant \ncolonies were isolated for further analysis. \nStructural analysis \u2013 The variable regions \nof B1.3.9 and B5.2.14 were sequenced and their \ndeduced amino-acid sequences were analyzed by \naligning them to the human germline sequences \n(http:\/\/imgt.cines.fr\/). The complementary \ndetermining regions were assigned according to \nChothia (Chothia et al., 1992). 3D models of the \nscFvs were generated by homology-based \nmodeling using the SWISS-model and WAM \n(Chothia et al., 1992). Graphic representations of \nthe 3D molecular features were generated with the \nSwiss-PdbViewer v3.7 software package (Guex et \nal., 1997) using previously published structures of \nCtxB5 (Merritt et al., 1997) and EtxB5 (Sixma et \nal., 1992).  Electrostatic molecular surface \npotentials were generated using the eF-site \n(http:\/\/ef-site.hgc.jp\/) \nExpression of soluble scFv \u2013 E. coli \nHB2151 was infected with individual phages for \n30 min at 37\u00b0C and then plated onto TYE plates \ncontaining 100 \u00b5g\/ml ampicillin and incubated \novernight at 37\u00b0C. Single colonies were inoculated \nin 2xTY medium (16 g\/L tryptone, 10 g\/L yeast \nextract and 5 g\/L NaCl) containing 100 \u00b5g\/ml \nampicillin and 1% glucose. scFv expression was \ninduced with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside \n(IPTG) when the cultures reached an OD600 = 0.9. \nThe cultures were further incubated overnight at \n30\u00b0C and the culture supernatants containing the \nsecreted scFvs were collected by centrifugation at \n3,000 rpm for 15 min for subsequent analysis. \nPeriplasmic extracts were prepared by \nresuspending the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of ice-\ncold PBS, pH 7.2 containing polymyxi B sulphate \n(1,000 units\/ml) and incubated on ice for 15 min. \nSamples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C at \n3,000 rpm and 100 \u00b5l of the supernatants were \nused for ELISA. \n \n \n9 \nSDS-polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and \nWestern blot- \nEtxB5 (8 g), boiled (5min) EtxB5 (EtxB1 \u2013 8\nand boiled\/reduced (in 30mM dithiothreitol) were \nloaded into SDS-polyacrylamide 14% (w\/v) gels \nfor electrophoresis on a Bio-Rad Protean II system. \nAfter SDS-PAGE, gels were transferred to \nnitrocellulose paper with transfer buffer in a Bio-\nRad Trans-Blot apparatus for 45 min to permit \nefficient transfer. Non-specific binding sites were \nblocked overnight in PBS containing 5% (w\/v) \nMarvel. Blots were washed in PBS containing \n0.05% v\/v Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 3 x 10min with \nagitation. B5.2.14 supernatant (approximately \n2\nwith agitation. Blots was washed as previously and \nincubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to \nhorseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2000 for 1h. The \nblots were then washed and developed with an \nenhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, \nAmersham) for 10min. \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nSelection of phage-displayed scFvs \u2013 The \nGriffin.1 human scFv library was expanded and \nthe phagemids selected by solid phase panning \nusing antigen directly coated to test tubes \n(immuno-tubes). After initial panning, antigen-\nbinding phages were collected and expanded \nfollowing re-infection of TG1 bacterial cells. This \ncycle of selection and expansion was repeated 3 \ntimes following selection for phagemids binding to \neither EtxB1 or EtxB5. Resulting enrichment was \nassessed using ELISA against plates coated with \neither EtxB1 or EtxB5 (Figure 1). EtxB5 \nspecificities were in greater abundance in the \nlibrary and by the third round the majority of \ncolonies tested had reactivity against EtxB5 . It was \nclear that the library had less reactivity against \nEtxB1 and even after 3 rounds of selection against \nEtxB1 there was markedly less reactivity seen in \nthe isolated phages (Figure 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \nAnalysis of selected monoclonal phages \n\u2013 The clones displaying the highest reactivities \nwere then transfected into E. coli TG1 cells for \nscale up to confirm the antigen-binding properties \nand follwing the expansion of the 3 EtxB1 selected \nclones in TG1 cells only phage-displayed B1.3.9 \nshowed consistent reactivity in ELISA (Figure \n2A). In terms of specificity B1.3.9 also showed \nreactivity against EtxB5 coated directly to plastic \n(Figure 2A). However,  following transfection of \nthe phagemid into permissive HB2151 bacterial \ncells, no soluble scFv was present (Figure 2B) \n(summarized in Table 1). This is discussed later in \nrelation to the sequence analysis. \n \nTwo of the 4 phagemid colonies expanded \nin TG1 cells from the selected EtxB5 panning \nshowed consistent results in ELISA (Figure 2A) \nand both B5.2.11 and B5.2.14 both gave a higher \nELISA signal for EtxB5 over EtxB1. However, only \nthe EtxB5 specific scFv (B5.2.14) was secreted \nfollowing transfection into HB2151 cells (Figure \n2B). \nSequence analysis of B.1.3.9 and B5.2.14 \nscFv \u2013 The inserts of scFvs that were specific for \nEtxB1 or EtxB5 (B1.3.9 and B5.2.14) were \nsequenced to assess their germline alignment \nspecificities compared to the published V-BASE \ndirectory. The phage display library was generated \nfrom human VH, V\u03bb and V\u03ba germline exons and \nits generation and composition has been described \nand analyzed in great detail (Tomlinson et al., \n1992; Nissim et al., 1994). A detailed comparison \nwith the identified scFv-clones was therefore done \nto identify unusual sequence features or artifacts \nthat may have been acquired during the course of \nthe experiments. We therefore determined the \nDNA sequences of scFv-B1.3.9 and scFv-B5.2.14 \n(Figure 3) and identified the corresponding \ngermline exons.  \nThe VL of ScFv-B5.2.14 belongs to the \nV\u03bb-I subgroup and has highest homology with \ngermline segment DP-L3. There is one single \nnucleotide change leading to a conservative \nGly\n95b\u2192Ala95b mutation located in the CDR-L3. \nThe VH of scFv-B5.2.14 belongs to the VH-I \n \n \n11 \nsubgroup and shows closest homology to the \ngermline segment DP-14. There is also one \nconservative mutation leading to a Trp\n103\u2192Leu103 \nchange. Trp\n103\n is a very strongly conserved residue \nand is found in all 6 germline segments of the \njoining element. Both observed mutations are \nexactly at the junctions where the 0-3 and 4-12 \namino acid long random insertions have been \nmade (Nissim et al., 1994). This suggests that \nthese mutations have likely resulted from the \ninitial generation of the recombinant antibody \ngenes and were not acquired during panning and \nselection. \nThe VL of scFv-B1.3.9 belongs to the V\u03bb-\nIII subgroup showing highest homology to the \ngermline segment DP-L16 (Figure 3). There are \nthree amino acid changes, all of which are not \ncritical in terms of structural aspects. The \nThr\n5\u2192Ile5 change is located in framework-1 and is \na surface exposed residue. The Asn\n95a\u2192Thr95a and \nHis\n95b\u2192Val95b changes are located in CDR-L3 and \nare likely part of the paratope of scFv-B1.3.9. \nThese residues are also located at the junction \nwhere the 0-3 amino acid long random insertions \nhave been made. The VH of scFv-B1.3.9 belongs \nto the VH-I subgroup having highest homology to \ngermline segment DP-4. Three mutations have \nbeen identified. The changes from Met\n2\u2192Val2 and \nMet\n89\u2192Val89 are conservative. Valine is \npreferentially found in the other germline segments \nof the VH-I subgroup and can therefore be judged \nto be a non-problematic change. The third \nmutation, however, is a critical nonsense mutation \nleading to an amber stop codon at position 64 \n(Gln\n64\u2192amber64). This explains why the \nexpression of soluble scFv was not successful \nwhile strong reactivity was observed for the phage-\ndisplayed scFv-B1.3.9 (Figure 2B). The phage-\ndisplayed scFv is expressed in E. coli TG1, which \nis a suppressor strain to allow the expression of a \nfusion-protein between the pIII and the scFv. TG1 \ncan introduce glutamine at amber stop codons, thus \nrestoring the authentic germline residue at position \nH64. In contrast, E. coli strain HB2151 used for \nproduction of soluble scFv is a non-suppressor \n \n \n12 \nstrain. As a result, no functional soluble form of \nscFv-B1.3.9 is produced in this strain.   \nIn order to overcome the problem of the \nnonsense mutation introduced at position H64 of \nscFv-B1.3.9, preventing the expression of a \nsoluble form of the scFv, it was converted to the \ndesignated germline sequence using SOE-PCR \n(see Methods). The corrected clone was sequenced \nto confirm the introduction of the Gln\n64 \ncoding \nsequence (data not shown) and this new clone was \ndesignated scFv-B1.3.9\nc\n.  \nCharacterization of B1.3.9\nc\n and B5.2.14  \n\u2013 Nine ampicillin resistant colonies were selected \nfor production of soluble scFv-B1.3.9\nc \n(Figure 4). \nAll clones expressed functional scFvs that bound \nto EtxB1 showing that the acquired nonsense \nmutation was successfully and properly corrected. \nWe then went on to analyze the binding specificity \nof scFv-B1.3.9\nc\n by comparing the binding against \nEtxB1 and directly coated EtxB5. As was \npreviously observed for the phage-displayed \nB1.3.9 (Figure 2A), the soluble scFv-B1.3.9\nc\n \nexhibited equivalent binding activity against both \nEtxB1 and directly coated EtxB5 suggesting it \nrecognizes a shared epitope. However scFv-\nB1.3.9\nc\n was shown not to bind to EtxB5 captured to \nGM1-ganglioside (Figure 4) suggesting the epitope \nbecomes inaccessible when the complex is formed. \nWe then used a recently described, well-\ncharacterized conformation specific monoclonal \nantibody for comparison to B5.2.14 (Chung et al., \n2006). LDS16 is a neotope-specific monoclonal \nantibody that binds to directly coated as well as to \nGM1-ganglioside captured EtxB5 and does not \nrecognize EtxB1. As in our previous study we \nlooked at the specificity of the antibodies by \nconcentration dependent inhibition assays (Figure \n5). As we described previously LDS16 binding to \ncoated EtxB5 was inhibited in the presence of \nsoluble EtxB5. However, while B5.2.14 binding \nwas partially inhibited, this only reached a \nmaximum level of 10% (Figure 5A). As expected, \nLDS16 binding to GM1 captured EtxB5 was not \ninhibited by EtxB1 and there was no binding of \nB5.2.14 to GM1 captured EtxB5 (Figure 5B). Lastly, \nthere was no inhibition of either LDS16 or B5.2.14 \n \n \n13 \nbinding to EtxB5 coated plates by EtxB1 produced \nby boiling EtxB5 (Figure 5C), while there was a \nmarked contrast in the results obtained by using \nboiled and reduced EtxB5 (Figure 5D). Here, EtxB1 \n(DTT) markedly inhibited the binding of B5.2.14 \nto EtxB5 coated plates while, as shown previously, \nLDS16 binding was unaffected. This was \nconfirmed using western blotting, which showed \nthat B5.2.14 only reacted with DTT reduced \nEtxB5, and not with boiled EtxB5 (Figure 5E). \nThese results serve to illustrate the rather subtle \nbut distinctive differences of the binding \nspecificities between these two recombinant \nantibodies. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nHere we have reported the successful \nisolation of scFvs against EtxB by phage display. \nAs in previous studies with conventional mAbs \n(Chung et al., 2006) we have set out to define \nindividual scFvs that can differentiate between \ndifferent forms of EtxB.  \nWe and others have previously used a \ncombination of ELISA and SDS-PAGE to study \nthe kinetics of both EtxB and CtxB assembly \n(Ruddock et al., 1995). In later experiments we \nused a combination of these techniques and \ntryptophane fluorescent spectroscopy to elucidate a \nkinetic model of how toxin assembly in vitro may \ntake place (Lesieur et al., 2002). It was shown that \nassembly of CtxB5 occurs via ordered formation of \noligomeric species and that they can equally go \nthrough two alternative pathways to form the fully \nassembled pentamer. In addition, other \nexperiments investigating A\/B subunit assembly \nhave suggested that holotoxin formation requires \nthe A-subunit to interact with a B-subunit \nassembly intermediate rather than with fully \nassembled CtxB5 (Hirst, 1995).  \nOur studies using conventional mAbs have \nidentified epitopes potentially important for \ninvestigating pentameric subunit assembly but \nthese have limitations for use in studying assembly \nin vivo (Chung et al., 2006). Recombinant single-\nchain Fv antibodies potentially offer a great \n \n \n14 \nadvantage in this respect. Other studies using \nmonoclonal scFvs against (H. pylori) urease \n(Reiche et al., 2002) and hepatitis B virus surface \nantigen (HBsAg) (Zhang et al., 2006) have \nhighlighted the advantage of this approach. In the \nfirst instance anti-urease antibodies derived from \nH. pylori infected patients have helped to define \nimportant antigenic epitopes involved with disease \nrecovery (Reiche et al., 2002) and in the second \ninstance anti-HBsAg scFvs are being used to \ndevelop strategies to block viral entry (Zhang et \nal., 2006). In addition these anti-HBsAg scFvs \nfused with interferon can be used as a reagent in \nthe therapy of chronic hepatitis B (Zhang et al., \n2006). These newly prepared anti-EtxB scFvs open \nup considerable scope for extending earlier studies \nby potentially enabling the interaction of \nantibodies with toxin assembly intermediates to be \ncarried out both in vitro and in vivo.  \nSelection was performed against two \ndifferent forms of EtxB, the heat dissociated \ndisassembled monomeric form EtxB1 and the \nassembled pentameric form EtxB5. After two to \nthree rounds of panning monoclonal phage-ELISA \nshowed that phagemid clones were selected that \nexhibited binding specificity to EtxB1 or EtxB5 \n(Figure 2). Further characterization of individual \nclones allowed us to focus on one phagemid with \nspecificity for EtxB1 (scFv-B1.3.9) and one with \nspecificity for EtxB5 (scFv-B5.2.14) (Table 1, \nFigure 2). We should note that although no \nisolated scFvs showed specificity for EtxB1 \nwithout cross-reactivity to directly coated EtxB5 \nwe do have some preliminary evidence (data not \nshown) that such scFvs may be present in the \nlibrary. \nSince both B5.2.14 and B1.3.9\nc\n do not \nbind to GM1-ganglioside captured EtxB5 it could be \nhypothesized that they recognize an epitope that \noverlaps with the GM1-ganglioside binding site or \nan epitope that is located at the bottom surface of \nthe pentameric EtxB. The surface potential of both \nEtxB5 and CtxB5 in this region is highly basic to \nfacilitate binding to the negatively charged cell \nsurface (Figure 6B). Thus, it is rational to expect \nthat an antibody binding in this region would have \n \n \n15 \nan antigen-binding site with a negative surface \npotential. However, inspection of the amino-acid \ncomposition of the CDRs (Figure 3) shows a \nrelatively high preponderance of basic residues for \nboth B1.3.9\nc\n and B5.2.14. Theoretical calculations \nof the Fv iso-electric points yielded 9.8 for B1.3.9\nc\n \nand 9.6 for B5.2.14. To further support this notion \nwe generated homology models for both scFvs to \nspecifically look for the charge distribution in the \nparatope.  \nBoth paratopes exhibit highly basic \nsurfaces (Figures 6C and D) that make it unlikely \nthat either B1.3.9\nc\n or B5.2.14 would recognize an \nepitope located at the bottom side of pentameric \nEtxB although this cannot be excluded. \nInterestingly, the peptides identified by Marcel et \nal. (in this issue) were also highly basic, \nsuggesting that similar binding regions were \ntargeted by both approaches. Moreover, binding of \nthe phage-displayed peptides to EtxB5 was not \ninhibited by soluble GM1-ganglioside and soluble \nEtxB5 bound to phages dotted onto nitrocellulose. \nThus steric hindrance offers no complete or \nsatisfying explanation for the observed lack of \nbinding towards GM1-ganglioside captured EtxB5. \nThe specificity of B1.3.9\nc\n is, in fact, strongly \nreminiscent of the conventional mAb LDS47 \nagainst an N-terminal region of EtxB1 (Figure 6A) \nthat we previously described which also bound to \ndirectly coated EtxB5 (Amin et al., 1995). \nThe fine specificity of B5.2.14 was \ninvestigated using competition ELISA assays with \nthe conventional mAb LDS16 as a comparison \n(Figure 5). This gave an intriguing result. Firstly, \nsoluble EtxB5 inhibition of binding to directly \ncoated EtxB5 was only marginal (Figure 5A). We \ncan think of only two possible explanations for this \n10% maximal inhibition: a) the existence of \ndifferent conformational states of the epitope and \nb) the presence of disassembled intermediates. \nSince disassembled intermediates would only \nconstitute a small fraction of the total protein \nbecause of the high intrinsic stability of the \npentameric form we believe the existence of \ndifferent conformational states of the epitope to be \nmore likely. We have previously hypothesized that \n \n \n16 \na conformational change occurs in the protein \nupon binding to a solid surface exposing an \nepitope not normally accessible in the fully folded \nconformation (Lesieur et al., 2002). Similar \nconclusions have been drawn from studies with the \n\u03b22 subunit of E. coli tryptophan synthase (Friguet \net al., 1984). Secondly, although, as we showed \nearlier (Figure 2B), there was no binding in ELISA \nof scFv-B5.2.14 to denatured (boiled) EtxB1, in \nFigure 5D we clearly show that DTT \nreduced\/denatured EtxB1 strongly inhibits binding \nto EtxB5. These results were confirmed by western \nblotting, which not only gave an appropriate band \n(Mr = 12,000) for the denatured\/boiled EtxB but \nalso gave a faint band (Mr = 43,000) consistent \nwith EtxB5 (Figure 5E). Thus, this is almost \ncertainly a conformation dependent epitope \n(cryptotope) probably of a folding intermediate \nstructure (Figure 6A) and could be an ideal target \nfor studying pentamer formation in situ. It would \nbe interesting to repeat these inhibition \nexperiments with B1.3.9\nc \nto look at its finer \nspecificity. \nIn conclusion, this paper reports the \ngeneration of two scFvs with differential binding \nspecificities that may provide useful molecular \nprobes for studying EtxB pentamer assembly. The \navailability of such reagents opens up key areas for \nthe development of new therapeutics that can \nblock toxin formation in situ and thus be used for \nthe treatment of diarrhoeal diseases caused by \nE. coli and V. cholera. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe would like to thank Dr. Andrew Griffiths for providing the Griffin.1 human scFv library (MRC, \nCambridge, UK).

The \npolyclonal phages after the 1\nst\n, 2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n round of panning were tested for reactivity against monomeric \nand pentameric EtxB by direct phage-ELISA. Enrichment of scFvs against the pentamer was more \nefficient and the polyclonal phages exhibited only low reactivity against monomeric (boiled) EtxB. Phages \nselected for binding to monomeric EtxB, on the other hand, were enriched less efficiently and showed \nsignificant cross-reactivity against pentameric EtxB. \n \nFigure 2. Binding specificities of monoclonal phages. (A) Several phages were selected for a \nlarge-scale phage preparation and their binding reactivities against different EtxB forms were analysed by \nELISA. (B) Soluble scFvs were produced for 4 monoclonal phages and were analysed by ELISA. \n \nFigure 3. Sequence analysis of scFv-B1.3.9 and scFv-B5.2.14. Sequences were aligned to the \nhuman germline segments reported in the V-BASE directory (http:\/\/vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk\/index.php). \nCDRs were assigned according to Cothia and are shown in bold. DP-L3, DP-L16, DP-14 and DP-4 are the \ndesignations of the germline sequences that most closely resemble those of the two scFvs and deviations \nare indicated. The insertion sites where the random sequences have been introduced are indicated by a \ngap. \n \nFigure 4. ELISA for soluble scFv-B1.3.9\nc\n. Nine ampicillin-resistant colonies were picked and \nused for small scale expression of soluble scFv-B1.3.9\nc\n. Culture supernatants were analysed against \nmonomeric (boiled) EtxB, directly coated EtxB5 and GM1-captured EtxB5 by ELISA.  \n \n \n \n21 \nFigure 5. Inhibition of the binding of B5.2.14 and LDS16 to different forms of soluble EtxB. (A) \nPlates were coated directly with EtxB5 (B5c) and probed with B5.2.14 or LDS16 and binding was \ninhibited by increasing concentrations of free EtxB5. (B) Plates were coated directly with EtxB5 (B5c) and \nboiled EtxB was used for competition. (C) Plates were coated directly with EtxB5 (B5c) and boiled and \nDTT treated EtxB was used as inhibitor. (D) Recognition of different forms of EtxB by scFv-B5.2.14 in \nWestern-blot. Lane 1, Boiled EtxB1; Lane 2, EtxB5; Lane 3, Boiled and reduced (DTT) EtxB1. The single \nheaded arrow denotes the positions of the monomeric form and the double headed arrow of the pentameric \nform. \n \nFigure 6. 3D-visualization of molecular features of the pentameric B-subunit and scFv-B1.3.9 and \nscFv-B5.2.14. (A) Graphical illustration of antibody epitopes mapped onto proposed dimeric EtxB folding \nintermediates. The second EtxB protomer (cyan) is shown in two alternate conformations. In the folded \nform Pro\n93\n (single headed arrow) is in the cis state and Cys\n9\n and Cys\n86\n form a disulfide-bridge. The -\nstrand number 6 is shown in grey. In proposed partially folded dimers the cysteines are reduced and Pro\n93\n \nis in the trans configuration (double headed arrow). Assembly can only proceed after isomerisation of \nPro\n93\n and disulfide-bridge formation. MAb LDS102 recognizes to the C-terminal end of EtxB1 and \npartially inhibits re-assembly (Chung et al 2006). The epitope of mAb LDS47 has been mapped to the N-\nterminal residues involving Cys\n9\n (red and orange), but binding is independent of the redox-state. In \ncontrast, scFv-B5.2.14 recognizes a different form and only binds to heat-denatured and reduced EtxB. \nScFv-B1.3.9 recognizes a cryptotope that is not accessible in the assembled pentamer but becomes \nexposed after heat-denaturation. Similarly to LDS47 but contrary to scFv-B5.2.14, reduction of the \ndisulfide-bridge is not a required for binding. (B) Visualisation of the surface potentials of EtxB5. The \nbottom side is highly basic to facilitate binding to the negatively charged cell surface receptor. The top \n \n \n22 \nsurface is characterised by a cluster of acidic residues comprising Asp\n22\n, Glu\n79\n and the C-terminus. Both \nscFv-B1.3.9 (C) and scFv-B5.2.14 (D) have high theoretical iso-electric points of 9.8 and 9.6 respectively. \nThe surfaces potentials were mapped onto homology-modelled structures and are viewed from the top, \nlooking down at the paratope. The antigen-binding site of scFvB1.3.9 is highly positively charged, \nsuggesting binding to a negatively charged region. \n \n \n \n23 \n  \nTable 1: Characterization of selected scFvs \n \n             Clone OD 450nm Scaled up phage prep As soluble scFv \nMonomer 3.1 0.4 No reactivity - \n(B1) 3.6 0.3 No reactivity - \n  3.9 1.0 +ve for monomer (1.0) No scFv found in C, P or S \n      \nPentamer 2.6 0.2 Slight reactivity (0.1) - \n(B5) 2.11 1.0 Positive for Pentamer scFv found in C only \n 2.14 1.0 Positive for Pentamer scFv found in C, P and S \n  2.15 0 No reactivity - \nC - cytoplasmic fraction; P - periplasmic fraction; S - culture supernatant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
