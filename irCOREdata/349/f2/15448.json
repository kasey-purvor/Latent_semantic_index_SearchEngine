Introduction\n[2] Gravel bed rivers have complex, porous and irregular\nsurfaces [Robert et al., 1992;Kirchner et al., 1990;Clifford et\nal., 1992; Butler et al., 2002; Lane et al., 2004] characterized\nby a range of morphological forms. These forms scale from\nindividual gravel grains through microtopographic particle\nclusters to large-scale bed forms [Brayshaw et al., 1983;\nRobert et al., 1993]. Flow in gravel bed rivers is typically\nshallow, and the relative submergence of clasts (ratio of mean\nflow depth to typical roughness height) seldom exceeds\n10\u201320 in floods and can be less than 5 during base flow\nconditions. In such shallow flows, the microtopography of\nthe bed exerts a significant influence on the generation of\ncoherent flow structures [Wiberg and Smith, 1991; Dinehart,\n1992]. Such structures are related to the wakes of individual\nobstacle clasts, and jetting of higher-velocity flow between\nsuch clasts, and may not penetrate vertically within the flow\nto much above the tops of the obstacles. Yet, field measure-\nments and laboratory visualization also indicate that shallow\nflows over gravel beds contain coherent macroturbulent flow\nstructures [e.g., Kirkbride, 1993; Best et al., 2001; Roy et al.,\n2004], whose origin and relationship to the ensemble of\nindividual roughness elements forming the bed is not quan-\ntitatively well understood. Much of the uncertainty in our\nunderstanding of these flow structures stems from the fact\nthat most previous studies have used point time series,\nsometimes with many points, but not time series of the whole\nflow field. Here we investigate the nature of coherent flow\nstructures formed over heterogeneous gravel surfaces and\nhow these are influenced by flow Reynolds number, as\ndictated by changing the mean flow velocity while keeping\nthe flow depth constant. These aims are addressed by use of\ndigital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV), which enables\nthe whole, time-dependent flow field to be examined.\n2. Background\n[3] Coherent turbulent flow structures, defined herein\nas repetitive quasi-cyclic large-scale turbulent motions\n[Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001], are prevalent in depth-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, F01003, doi:10.1029\/2007JF000970, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n2Department of Geology and Department of Geography, and Ven Te\nChow Hydrosystems Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nUrbana, Illinois, USA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2007JF000970$09.00\nF01003 1 of 18\nlimited open channel flows. Shvidchenko and Pender [2001]\nreport that Velikanov [1949] was the first to propose a\ntheoretical model of turbulence in open channels that con-\nsisted of depth-scale rolling vortices that were both structured\nand quasiperiodic. Since then, several experimental studies\nhave combined flow visualization techniques with flow\nmeasurements [e.g., Fidman, 1953, 1991; Klaven, 1966;\nKlaven and Kopaliani, 1973; Imamoto and Ishigaki, 1986a,\n1986b; Best et al., 2001; Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001; Roy\net al., 2004] to gain an understanding of the generation,\nevolution and dissipation of these large-scale structures, over\nboth smooth and homogenous rough surfaces. These studies\nhave identified large-scale eddies that scale closely with the\nflow depth (h) in the vertical and approximately 2h in the\nlateral spanwise direction [Zaitsev, 1984]. The downstream\nscale of these structures appears to be dependent upon both\nbed roughness and hydraulic conditions: the greater the flow\ndepth and velocity, the more pronounced the development of\nthe coherent flow structure [Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001].\nThe downstream scale of these structures has been proposed\nto be between 4h and 7h, with this scale increasing as bed\nroughness decreases [Klaven, 1966; Klaven and Kopaliani,\n1973; Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001]. It has also been\nsuggested that the origin of these flow structures is closely\nlinked to the bursting phenomena in turbulent boundary\nlayers [Grishanin, 1990; Yalin, 1992; Smith, 1996; Grass and\nMansour-Tehrani, 1996] where (1) ejected, low-momentum\nfluid travels across the entire flow depth irrespective of the\nbed roughness [Grass, 1971; Talmon et al., 1986; Shen\nand Lemmin, 1999] and (2) high-momentum fluid moves\nfrom near the water surface toward the bed [Rashidi and\nBanerjee, 1988; Grass et al., 1991]. However, in most\nphysical modeling studies, the rough boundaries have been\nrestricted to well-sorted beds composed of homogenous\nparticles where skimming flow develops [Grass, 1971;Grass\net al., 1991; Krogstad et al., 1992]. Therein, the mechanism\nof momentum exchange shows strong similarities to bursting\nprocesses over smooth surfaces [Smith, 1996; Grass and\nMansour-Tehrani, 1996], although the origin of such struc-\ntures may be radically different [Kirkbride, 1993; Smith,\n1996; Best, 1996]. Studies of turbulent flow structures in\ngravel bed rivers in the field are limited because of the\nchallenges of instrumentation [Roy et al., 1996], although\nstudies over natural gravel beds suggest that coherent flow\nstructures in the near-bed region scale with respect to both the\nsize and sorting of the bed material [Clifford et al., 1992;\nClifford and French, 1993]. As with flow over smooth beds,\nthe larger structures may be created by the coalescence and\namalgamation of numerous smaller-scale structures [Head\nand Bandyopadhyay, 1981; Smith et al., 1991]. Microtopo-\ngraphic features, such as particle clusters, are prevalent in\nmost gravel bed rivers [Brayshaw et al., 1983; Biggs et al.,\n1997] and localized topographic forcing of flow may provide\na dominant mechanism for momentum exchange. This is\ncommonly thought to be in the form of a horseshoe vortex\nformed upstream of clasts, and shedding of vortices in the lee\nof the cluster [Robert et al., 1992, 1993; Kirkbride, 1993],\nwith the upstream horseshoe vortex being analogous to a\nsimple juncture vortex [Brayshaw et al., 1983; Best, 1996;\nBuffin-Be\u00b4langer and Roy, 1998; Lawless and Robert, 2001].\nHere, a region of weak recirculation is caused by flow\nstagnation and separation immediately upstream of the\nobject, which leads to the generation of vorticity that can,\nin turn, trigger the formation of large-scale coherent flow\nstructures [Lawless, 2004].\n[4] Given the above, it is clear that a full understanding of\nthe causes and regularity of macroturbulent fluctuations in\nshallow flows over gravel beds does not exist. Indeed,\nprocess information derived from data collected from pre-\nvious studies provides contradictory evidence. Some studies\nhave been interpreted as showing low-frequency velocity\nfluctuations corresponding to a spatial scale of the order of\nthe flow depth [Komori et al., 1982; Grinvald and Nikora,\n1988; Clifford et al., 1992; Lapointe, 1992; Nezu and\nNakagawa, 1993; Robert et al., 1993; Roy et al., 1996;\nCellino and Graf, 1999; Shen and Lemmin, 1999]. However,\nother authors do not detect any regular periodicity in the\nturbulent fluctuations of flow [Grinvald, 1974; Nikora and\nSmart, 1997], which suggests the coherent flow structures\nare randomly distributed in time and space [Nychas et al.,\n1973; Smith, 1996; Nikora and Goring, 1999]. In order to\ndetermine quantitatively the generation, evolution and typ-\nical spatial and temporal persistence of such turbulent flow\nstructures over heterogeneous gravel surfaces, it is neces-\nsary both to visualize and quantify the whole flow field\ncontinuously. The present paper reports on a study of depth-\nlimited flow at three different flow Reynolds numbers over\na water-worked gravel surface. The influence of the Reynolds\nnumber was investigated by increasing the mean flow\nvelocity while keeping flow depth constant. Flow velocities\nwere quantified by application of two-dimensional digital\nparticle imaging velocimetry (2-D DPIV) which enables\ncontinuous measurement of the whole flow field. These\nDPIV measurements were linked to high-resolution quanti-\nfication of the bed surface topography obtained using digital\nphotogrammetry. This experimental setup enabled study of\nthe generation and evolution of coherent flow structures\nover a known bed topography that allowed identification of\n(1) the topographic characteristics required for generation of\nmacroscale turbulent flow structures, (2) the geometric\nshape of the flow structures, (3) the temporal length scales\nof the flow structures, and (4) how these characteristics\nchange with flow Reynolds number.\n3. Experimental Methodology\n[5] All experiments were conducted in a hydraulic flume,\n10 m in length (lc) and 0.3 m in width (w). A series of four\n\u2018\u2018honeycomb\u2019\u2019 baffle plates were fastened to the channel\ninlet in order to dampen incoming turbulence and to help\nestablish a uniform, subcritical, depth-limited boundary\nlayer upstream of the gravel surface. The slope of the flume\nwas adjusted to achieve constant flow depth within the test\nsection, which was located 5.5 m downstream from the\nchannel inlet.\n3.1. Digital Elevation Model Generation Using\nDigital Photogrammetry\n[6] A bulk sample of sediment from the River Wharfe,\nnorthern England, was placed in the flume and water\nworked until a stable bed (no sediment transport) was\nobtained. The surface morphology was then measured using\nclose range terrestrial digital photogrammetry. Using the\nmethods established by Butler et al. [1998] and Carbonneau\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n2 of 18\nF01003\net al. [2003], a photogrammetric survey was designed in\norder to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) with a\nspatial resolution of 1 mm2. This survey employed a Kodak\nDCS 460 digital camera with an imaging resolution of\n3060 \u0001 2036 pixels in standard red, green and blue bands.\nHigh-precision DEMs are regularly produced with such\ncameras provided that additional surveyed ground calibra-\ntion points are added on the target surface [Carbonneau et\nal., 2003]. Accordingly, 84 ground control targets were\nglued to stable large clasts in the bed. These targets were\nthen surveyed with a Geodimeter 608S total station to\nobtain x, y, z coordinates of points with a known position\nin the imagery. To generate a DEM of the investigation\nregion, nine consecutive images with 60% overlap between\nconsecutive images were required. The resulting DEM was\nnot smoothed. However, the edges were cropped to elimi-\nnate errors that typically occur on the periphery of the DEM,\nas a result of greater geometric distortion with distance\naway from the image centre. The size of the final DEM was\n0.923 by 0.26 m (Figure 1) with a vertical precision of\n\u00b10.001 m. The topographic statistics of the DEM are given\nin Table 1, and represent the topographic elevation of each\n0.001 m grid cell rather than that of individual gravel\nparticles.\n3.2. Hydraulic Conditions\n[7] In these experiments, the water depth was maintained\nat a constant value of 0.2 m, with three different experi-\nments being undertaken at mean downstream velocities at\n0.4 z\/h of 0.155 m s\u00021, 0.3 m s\u00021, and 0.435 m s\u00021 (where z\nand h are height above the bed and flow depth, respectively).\nThe constant flow depth of 0.2 m was adopted for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons. The present study aimed to\nunderstand the nature of coherent flow structures forming\nover a heterogeneous gravel surface and the influence of an\nincrease in flow Reynolds number (through changes in flow\nvelocity) upon the generation of these flow structures.\nConsequently, depth was held constant and mean flow\nvelocity was used to increase the flow Reynolds number.\nAdditionally, in practical terms, it was not possible to\nilluminate the whole flow depth with the laser configuration\nused herein. If greater flow depths were used it would not\nhave been possible to track the flow structures to the water\nsurface. Table 2 summarizes the hydraulic conditions used\nin the study and the experiments are subsequently referred\nto according to their flow Reynolds numbers (Re).\n[8] Velocity measurements were obtained using a\nDANTEC two-dimensional digital particle imaging veloc-\nimetry system (2-D DPIV), which is a nonintrusive, whole\nflow field technique for velocity measurement. A major\nadvantage of DPIV is that it is multipoint, and can be used\nto study the entire flow field instantaneously to allow\nquantitative flow visualization (by analysis of consecutive\nresolved velocity images) where flow structures can be\nobserved moving over the bed. The DPIV methodology\nand postprocessing applied herein is identical to that previ-\nously used by Hardy et al. [2005] and only a brief synopsis\nFigure 1.

Measurement is based upon seeding the\nflowwith neutrally buoyant tracer particles (hollow reflective\nglass spheres with a mean diameter of 10 mm) and illumi-\nnating the flow field with a double-pulsed 50 mJ Nd-YAG\nlaser light sheet, with the time gap between flashes being set\nto 0.067 s. When the laser sheet illuminated the flow, light\nwas scattered by the seeding material and detected by a\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) camera positioned perpendic-\nular to the light sheet. In order to derive a velocity vector map,\na digital mesh of small interrogation regions (16\u0001 16 pixels,\nwhere 1 pixel \u0004 2.5 \u0001 10\u00024 m) was draped over the images.\nFor each interrogation region, in each pair of images, the\ndisplacement of groups of particles between the first and\nsecond image was measured using a fast Fourier transform\u2013\nbased spatial cross-correlation technique and a velocity\nvector was determined [see Westerweel, 1997]. The entire\nprocess was repeated at 15 Hz until the flow was sampled\nfor 1 min. This sample length provided a sufficient time\nperiod to obtain a stationary time series, which was tested\nby systematic convergence of the cumulative variance for\nboth velocity components to a constant value (for a full\nexplanation see Sukhodolov and Rhoads [2001]) and\nfollows the recommended sampling period suggested by\nBuffin-Be\u00b4langer and Roy [2005].\n[9] In the present study, the DPIV camera was located\nperpendicular to the bed, so that slices of flow could be\ninterrogated for the downstream u and vertical w components\nof velocity. With a 16 \u0001 16 pixel interrogation region and\nthe setup described above, each instantaneous velocity map\nconsisted of 15,750 individual vectors enabling data collec-\ntion at a spatial resolution of 2 \u0001 10\u00023 m. In order to\nmaximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the particle cross\ncorrelations, a sequence of six quality checks [see Hardy\net al., 2005] was undertaken. With this methodology, the\nestimated precision of the derived velocities is greater than\none tenth of a pixel [Wilbert and Gharib, 1991; Huang et\nal., 1997; DANTEC Dynamics, 2000]. Thus, the uncertainty\nin the velocity measurement is better than \u00b10.08 mm s\u00021.\n[10] The area illuminated by the light sheet over the gravel\nsurfaces was aligned along the centerline of the flume. For\nthis transect, three sections, each \u20190.25 m in downstream\nlength, were collected to enable a time-averaged map of\n0.75 m length to be quantified (see location of DPIV area in\nFigure 1). Because of the illumination requirements, two\nregions needed to be illuminated and DPIV data collected in\nthe vertical dimension: (1) the near-bed region and (2) the\nregion extending to the free surface (see Figure 1). Thus, six\ninterrogation regions were collected to cover the 0.75 m\ndownstream length for each of the three different flow\nconditions, with the map for each Reynolds number con-\nsisting of \u000390,000 points.\n3.3. Analysis Methodology\n[11] The DPIV data was collected on a regular grid (125\u0001\n126, covering a spatial area of 0.25 by 0.252 m) with each\npoint providing a time series for 1 min at a temporal\nresolution of 15 Hz. The whole flow field can then be analyzed\nby either time-averaged or time-dependent techniques. In this\nstudy, we explore the flow characteristics through (1) the\ntime-averaged flow fields, (2) instantaneous flow visualiza-\ntion, which is achieved by the analysis of consecutive images\nof the calculated u component velocity minus 0.85 of the\nmean value at each point following the recommendation of\nAdrian et al. [2000], (3) the time-averaged and instantaneous\nuw vorticity (w), (4) the root-mean-square (RMS) values\nof the deviatoric components of velocity, (5) analysis of\nturbulent structures through classical quadrant analysis, and\n(6) identification of temporal length scales through wavelet\nanalysis.\n3.3.1. Quadrant Analysis\n[12] Quadrant analysis has previously been used to dis-\ncriminate boundary layer turbulent events by examining the\ninstantaneous deviations of velocity from the mean values\n[e.g., Lu and Willmarth, 1973; Bogard and Tiederman,\n1986; Bennett and Best, 1995; Hardy et al., 2007]. By\napplying the standard definition of Lu and Willmarth [1973],\nfour quadrants can be defined around a zero mean: quadrant 1\nevents or outward interactions (positive u component, pos-\nitive w component), quadrant 2 events or ejections (bursts)\n(negative u component, positive w component), quadrant 3\nevents or inward interactions (negative u component, neg-\native w component), and quadrant 4 events or inrushes\n(sweeps) (positive u component, negative w component).\nIn the present analysis, each velocity pair was studied\nusing a \u2018\u2018hole\u2019\u2019 size [Lu and Willmarth, 1973; Bogard and\nTiederman, 1986; Bennett and Best, 1995] of one standard\ndeviation, in which the signal was examined only if the\nvalues exceeded this threshold.\n3.3.2. Wavelet Analysis\n[13] Wavelet analysis was identified as the most beneficial\nmethod of analysis because visual inspection of the time\nseries suggested that (1) the scales of variability were only\nintermittently present and (2) the scales of variability evolved\ntemporally and spatially as a function of time (or space). As\nthe evolution of scales of variability is continuous within\ndiscrete subseries, one option was to use a windowed\nFourier transform. However, this is both inaccurate (as it\ncan result in the aliasing of high- and low-frequency\ncomponents that do not fall within the frequency range of\nthe window) and inefficient (as a result of the number of\nfrequencies which must be analyzed at each time step\nregardless of the window size or dominant frequencies\npresent) [Torrence and Compo, 1998]. Here, we use wavelet\nanalysis with scale-dependent time frequency localization\n[e.g., Labat et al., 2000; Torrence and Compo, 1998], which\nis achieved by breaking the data series into a set of scaled\nand translated versions of a wavelet function, with the scale\nof the wavelet varying with frequency. Thus, whereas a\nFourier transform yields a power value for each frequency\ndetermined, wavelet analysis produces power values for a\nset of locations in time and for a range of frequencies, the\nlatter being related to the scales of the wavelet function\nconsidered. Wavelet analysis has also been previously\napplied in studies of turbulence [e.g., Farge, 1992].\n[14] A full review of wavelet analysis is provided by\nTorrence and Compo [1998], and the details below are\nrestricted to the application of wavelet analysis in the\npresent study. Herein, we use a simple, real and nonorthog-\nonal wavelet, the Morlet wavelet, to estimate the power\npresent in the time series for a set of s (time) scales of\nvariability and at a set of t time periods. The result is a\nwavelet power spectrum with power mapped onto each (s, t)\nlocation. Choosing the right type of wavelet for a given data\nseries is important, although if the prime goal of the study is\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n4 of 18\nF01003\ndetermination of the wavelet power spectra, the precise\nchoice of the wavelet should not matter as different wavelets\nwill give the same qualitative results [Torrence and Compo,\n1998]. Indeed, in a global sense, having to choose a\nparticular waveform is no different to the type of assump-\ntion made in conventional spectral analysis about the fit of\nparticular waveforms to the data. Nonetheless, some justi-\nfication of the choice adopted herein is required. First, the\nprime aim of this analysis was a continuous transformation\nof the time series into a time-dependent, period frequency\nseries in order to identify the intermittent presence of\nfeatures at a range of time scales, as well as possible\nevolution of the scale of features as a function of time.\nThis suggested that the continuous wavelet transform was\nmost appropriate. Second, we should expect a quasi-\ncontinuous variation in velocity fluctuations in this time\nseries, and thus a simple wavelet form was most appropri-\nate. Third, we needed to use a wavelet with a good\nfrequency resolution: the data were collected at 15 Hz,\nleading to the probability of some redundancy at smaller\ntime steps in relation to understanding the characteristics of\nmacroturbulence. Thus, time resolution was less important.\nAs a result of these deliberations, the present analysis\nutilized a Morlet wavelet, primarily because, of all the\nsimple wavelets considered, it has one of the best resolu-\ntions in frequency space. Furthermore, if the schematic\ndiagram of the elementary decomposition of turbulent energy\nfrom a characteristic eddy (as proposed by Tennekes and\nLumley [1972]) is studied, its morphology is very similar to\nthe Morlet wavelet. Consequently, it has been suggested that\nthe Morlet wavelet is the most appropriate for studying the\ndynamics of turbulence [Liandrat and Moret-Bailly, 1990].\n[15] Four additional issues need specific mention: (1) the\nreduction in the reliability of the analysis at the edges of the\ndata series, (2) the scales that will be analyzed, (3) conver-\nsion from wavelet scale to Fourier period, and (4) statistical\nsignificance testing in relation to the difference between the\nobserved wavelet fits and the theoretical wavelet fits asso-\nciated with a background spectrum. First, as the edges of a\ntime series are reached, the length (in seconds) of the\nwavelet that can be resolved will be reduced, and a cone\nof influence (or detectable scales) needs to be set. The\nMorlet wavelet has an e-folding time of\nffiffiffi\n2\np\ns, which was\nused to set the cone of influence. Second, with hundreds of\ndata at a 15 Hz resolution, there are 999 possible scales of\nanalysis. It is inefficient to analyze all of these scales as this\nleads to redundancy in power determination at long scales\n(where the resolved scale has a much lower frequency than\n15 Hz) and poor resolution at short scales (where the\nresolved scale has a frequency approaching the Nyquist\nfrequency of 7.5 Hz). Thus, we initially used a dyadic series\nand analyzed over the range 29 scales, which corresponds to\nscales of up to 51.2 s, but constrained by the cone of\ninfluence at the edges. In order to obtain a reasonable\nresolution in frequency space between dyadic numbers,\ntests suggested an increment of 0.1 was appropriate. Thus,\nwe analyzed scales from 21 through 2n to 29 where n was\nincremented in units of 0.1. Third, the wavelet scale is not\nnecessarily equivalent to the Fourier period, which is the\nequivalent scale measure that is of interest. Thus, we trans-\nformed the wavelet scale into the equivalent Fourier period,\nand hence frequency, prior to visualization of results\n[Torrence and Compo, 1998]. Finally, we determined\nwhether or not the particular fit of a wavelet for a given n\nand s was statistically significant. Torrence and Compo\n[1998] show that the most appropriate method for doing\nthis is based upon choice of an appropriate background\nspectrum that is associated with noise: if a point (at t, s) in\nthe wavelet power spectrum is statistically distinguishable\nfrom the associated point in the background spectrum, then\nit can be assumed to be a significant fit at the confidence\nlevel chosen for the analysis. As is commonly observed in\nvelocity time series, we assumed that white noise would be\npresent [Biron et al., 1998].\n4. Results\n4.1. Time-Averaged Flow Fields\n[16] The time-averaged flow fields for the downstream u\nand vertical w velocity components (Figure 2) show the\ninfluence of the bed topography on the near-bed flow.\nAnalysis of the time-averaged downstream u component\nfor the three different Reynolds numbers (Figures 2a\u20132c)\nshows areas of recirculation in the wakes of protruding\nFigure 2. Time-averaged velocity for (a, b, c) the downstream u component and (d, e, f) the vertical w\ncomponent and for three Reynolds numbers: 13,000 (Figures 2a and 2d), 25,000 (Figures 2b and 2e), and\n37,000 (Figures 2c and 2f). Flow direction is from right to left; z\/h is equal to 0.12 m, and x\/l is equal to\n0.25 m. Regions A, B, and C represent areas of local recirculation. All scales are in m s\u00021.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n5 of 18\nF01003\nclasts, above which there in an increase in average flow\nvelocity with depth. The local recirculation identified in the\nu component appears over a short distance (\u00030.03 m; region\nA in Figure 2a). The vertical w component more clearly\nidentifies regions of both separation and reattachment of\nflow over individual particles which are not necessarily\ndefined in the u component (region B in Figure 2e). These\nregions have a downstream length of \u00030.04 m that appears\nconsistent for all Reynolds numbers. In addition, the w com-\nponent identifies a larger region of reattachment, which\nexists for all three Re numbers, that is generated from a\nlarger clast upstream (region C in Figure 2f), and which\nextends over a downstream distance of \u00030.1 m. Although\nthese images are of the mean values, and individual coher-\nent flow structures are thus not identified, the effect of the\ntopographic protrusion of bed forms is clearly seen to\ninfluence the whole flow field.\n4.2. Instantaneous Flow Visualization\n[17] Analysis of the instantaneous downstream u velocity\ncomponent of flow for the three different Reynolds numbers,\nthrough a series of consecutive images, provides a visual-\nization of flow over the gravel surface (Figure 3). Following\nthe recommendation of Adrian et al. [2000], the simplest\napproach to analyze a turbulent flow is to decompose the field\ninto a constant streamwise velocity plus the deviatoric\ncomponent. There is no dynamical basis for preferring one\nframe of reference, and the one that provides the best\nvisualization should be used [Adrian et al., 2000]. In the\npresent study, the instantaneous u component of velocity\nminus 0.85 of the mean value is mapped, enabling better\ndetection and visualization of vortical structureswithin the flow.\n[18] All of the images demonstrate the highly variable\nnature of flow over the gravel surface and turbulent struc-\ntures close to the bed can be detected visibly: these are\nclearly seen as \u2018\u2018bulges\u2019\u2019 of lower-velocity fluid originating\nat the bed and intruding into the outer flow at all three\nReynolds numbers. These bulges of fluid are most visibly\ndetectable at Re = 37,000, where it can be seen that they\nextend throughout the entire image (Figure 3) which equates\nto 0.7 of the flow depth. The back of these large-scale\nturbulent structures adopt a defined boundary, sloping\nupstream at an angle visually estimated to be \u000330\u0001 (marked\nas dotted line 3ii in Figure 3). It is more difficult to define\nFigure 3. A time series of the instantaneous u component of velocity minus 0.85 mean u component.\nEach image is separated by 0.1333 s in increasing time steps down the figure; z\/h is equal to 0.12 m, and\nx\/l is equal to 0.25 m. For each of the images the flow is from right to left. The dotted lines represent\nvisual detection of the front and the back of the structures.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n6 of 18\nF01003\nthe front of the structure visually, although the downstream\nlead angle appears to be steeper at \u000345\u0001 (marked as dotted\nline 3i in Figure 3) than the rear, upstream back of the\nstructure. There is also an apparent decrease in the stream-\nwise velocity toward the back of the flow structure, with a\nclearly defined region of higher-velocity flow between each\nof these low-velocity structures (Figure 3). These features\ndecrease in their distinctiveness at lower Reynolds numbers;\nthe rear, upstream angle of the structures decreases and they\nare not visible as far from the bed (lines 1 and 2 in Figure 3).\nHowever, these features do show similar geometric charac-\nteristics to those formed at Re = 37,000, with the lower\nstreamwise velocity flow being located closer to the back of\nthe structure, and the downstream lead angle appearing\nsteeper but harder to define clearly (lines 1i and 2i in\nFigure 3). Furthermore, the distance between these struc-\ntures appears to increase at higher Reynolds number. In\nsummary, as the Reynolds number increases, then the visual\ndistinctiveness of these structures becomes more apparent as\n(1) they become visible through the whole image, which\nequates to \u00030.7 of the flow depth, (2) the downstream slope\nof the coherent structure increases, (3) the decrease in\nstreamwise flow velocity toward the back of the structure\nbecomes greater, and (4) the spacing between these coherent\nflow structures increases. These observations agree with\nprevious work which showed that at higher flow velocities\nthe development of coherent flow structures became more\npronounced [Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001]. Furthermore,\nour results appear to visualize structures similar to the\nclassical bursting phenomenon in which low-momentum\nfluid is ejected from the bed [Grass, 1971; Talmon et al.,\n1986; Shen and Lemmin, 1999; Roy et al., 2004; Lacey et\nal., 2007], although here this is clearly seen to be develop-\ning over the large anchor clasts in the bed. Studies in the\nturbulent boundary layer over a flat surface have also\nsuggested a change in the form and angle of hairpin vortices\nthat is dependent on the flow Reynolds number [Head and\nBandyopadhyay, 1981]. Head and Bandyopadhyay [1981]\nillustrate that at higher Reynolds numbers, the number of\nhairpins traversing the boundary layer decreases, but the\nvortices still penetrate through the entire boundary layer, as\nalso revealed in the present study over rough gravel surfaces.\n4.3. Time-Averaged and Instantaneous uw Vorticity\n[19] Analysis of the time-averaged and instantaneous uw\nvorticity enables an improved understanding of the magni-\ntude and spatial distribution of the turbulent stresses in the\nflow field. The time-averaged flow fields for the uw\nvorticity (Figure 4) show the influence of the bed topogra-\nphy on the near-bed flow for the three different Reynolds\nnumbers. Regions of high vorticity (w > 12 s\u00021) are located\nclose to the bed (<0.1 z\/h) for all three Reynolds numbers,\nwith vorticity decreasing in intensity away from the bed.\nFor Re = 13,000, areas of high vorticity are found in\nlocalized regions around large clasts, but as the Reynolds\nnumbers increases the high-vorticity zones become more\ncontinuous and influence more of the flow depth. Topo-\ngraphic protrusions from the bed are clearly seen to generate\nvorticity, although, as these images are time-averaged,\nindividual coherent flow structures cannot be identified\n[Agui and Andreopoulis, 1992] nor is it possible to deter-\nmine the typical spatial and temporal persistence of indi-\nvidual flow structures originating from individual clasts.\n[20] Analysis of the instantaneous uw vorticity of flow for\nthe three different Reynolds numbers, through a series of\nconsecutive images similar to the analysis of instantaneous\nvelocity (Figure 3), provides a visualization of flow over the\ngravel surface (Figure 5). The flow maps presented are for\nthe equivalent time steps to the instantaneous u component\nflow fields shown in Figure 3. All of the images demon-\nstrate the highly variable nature of flow over the gravel\nsurface and that turbulent structures close to the bed can be\ndetected visibly. Furthermore, as observed in the time-\naveraged flow fields, as the Reynolds number increases a\ncontinuous band of high (>15 s\u00021) vorticity forms in the\nnear-bed region (<0.1 z\/h). However, for all three Reynolds\nnumbers, the vorticity appears to originate from the bed and\noscillate between two forms (marked with dotted lines in\nFigure 5) that possess a shallow and a steeper angle,\npossibly representing the front and back of the flow struc-\nture. As revealed in the detection of flow structures using\nthe u component, the angles of the regions of high-intensity\nvorticity that originate from the bed become steeper as the\nReynolds number increases. Finally, as the Reynolds number\nincreases there appear to be more topographic protrusions\non the bed that have the potential to generate vortices.\n4.4. Turbulence Intensity\n[21] Turbulence intensity was evaluated using the RMS\nvalue of each velocity component at each point and reveals\n(Figure 6) regions of highly turbulent flow in the near-bed\nregion. Similar to the results shown for the u component of\nflow, the greatest turbulence intensity in the near-bed region\noccurs at higher Reynolds numbers, although by 0.5 z\/h the\nturbulence intensity becomes comparable for all three\nReynolds numbers for both components of velocity. For\nRe = 37,000, a band of intense turbulence extends from the\nbed to approximately 0.2 z\/h and is present across the whole\nof the field of view, except in the lee of the protruding\nclasts, where skimming flow accelerates fluid across the top\nof the particle (see Figure 2) and a recirculation zone exists\nbetween the clast and downstream reattachment point.\nFigure 4. Time-averaged uw vorticity (w)y for three Reynolds numbers: 13,000, 25,000, and 37,000.\nFlow direction is from right to left; z\/h is equal to 0.12 m, and x\/l is equal to 0.25 m.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n7 of 18\nF01003\nHowever, there appears to be a threshold spacing at which\nthis occurs, which scales with the relative protrusion of the\nupstream clast. As the Reynolds number increases, this\nintense band of turbulence intensity increases in its spatial\nextent and more localized regions of turbulence generation\nassociated with individual clasts become less distinct. These\nregions of discrete higher turbulence intensity at lower flow\nReynolds numbers appear to be linked to shear layers that\nform over individual clasts. At low Re, these near-bed flow\nstructures are related to the wakes of individual obstacle\nclasts, and jetting of higher-velocity flow between such\nclasts, and they may not penetrate vertically within the flow\nto much above the tops of the obstacles. Therefore, the\neffect of the bed morphology is more apparent at lower flow\nReynolds numbers, with the flow field becoming dominated\nat higher Reynolds number by a fixed band of intense\nturbulence that is formed as reattachment lengths increase.\nAt higher-flow Reynolds numbers, it appears that the shear\nlayers associated with flow separation around the larger\nclasts may \u2018\u2018amalgamate\u2019\u2019 and form a more unified region\nof higher turbulence intensity at z\/h \u0003 0.2.\n4.5. Quadrant Analysis\n[22] Quadrant 2 and quadrant 4 events are typically given\nmost emphasis in boundary layer studies in order to analyze\nthe extraction of energy from the mean flow field as part of\nturbulence generation, as they contribute positively to the\nbed shear stress. However, Nelson et al. [1995] demonstrated\nthe importance of quadrant 1 events as being the most\neffective, although least common, flow structures as regards\nsediment entrainment. The distribution of all four quadrants\nover the gravel surface (Figure 7) is consistent with previous\nobservations in that the relative contribution of each quad-\nrant, in terms of both magnitude and spatial distribution,\nremain similar at all three Reynolds numbers [e.g., Nelson et\nal., 1995], with quadrant 4 events dominating the distribu-\ntion in terms of magnitude [Nelson et al., 1995]. However,\nmore localized patterns of flow structures can be identified.\nIn the near-bed region (<0.15 z\/h), alternating patterns of\nquadrant 2 (stoss side) and quadrant 4 (lee side) events are\nobserved, demonstrating localized topographic forcing of\nthe flow. Furthermore, a dominant band of quadrant 2 events\nis observed higher in the flow (>0.3 z\/h). This identifies large-\nscale vorticity, potentially generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities that are formed along the leeside shear layers\n[Bennett and Best, 1995; Best, 2005], which lie just above\nthe region of maximum RMS values (Figure 4). This\nvorticity must originate from flow structures generated\nupstream, outside the field of view, as observed in the\nw component in Figure 2, although the shear layer can be\nseen to be \u2018\u2018fed\u2019\u2019 (lines 1, 2, and 3ii in Figure 3) from\nFigure 5. A time series of the instantaneous uw vorticity (w). Each image is separated by 0.1333 s and\ncorresponds to the same time step as the instantaneous u velocity component in Figure 3; z\/h is equal to\n0.12 m, and x\/l is equal to 0.25 m. For each of the images the flow is from left to right.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n8 of 18\nF01003\ncoherent flow structures originating from the bed. When\nquadrant 1 and quadrant 3 events are studied, a similar\nalternating pattern is apparent in the near-bed region as\nshown in the relationship between quadrants 2 and 4.\nQuadrant 1 events are located on the stoss side of particles\nwith quadrant 3 events occurring in the lee side. Therefore,\nas the flow approaches the particle, it decelerates or reverses\nclose to the bed, but otherwise accelerates as it is forced\nover (or around) the particle. Localized flow deceleration\nand recirculation occurs in the separation zones that form\ndownstream of the large anchor clasts, and a shear layer is\nalso associated with the horseshoe vortex formed around the\nstoss side of each clast [Lawless, 2004] and that extends\ndownstream.\nFigure 6.

Wavelet Analysis\n[23] The final part of the analysis of flow over this gravel\nbed examines the velocity time series by application of\nwavelet analysis, as expressed in four plots (Figures 8\u201311).\nThis approach is initially demonstrated for one time series\n(Re = 25,000, x\/l = 0.64, z\/h = 0.4; see Figure 8), in which\nthe wavelet power spectrum has the length of the time series\n(60 s) on the abscissa and the temporal length scale (in\nseconds) of the identified turbulent structures on the ordi-\nnate axis. This wavelet power spectrum identifies three\ndistinct periodicities at 1.5, 4, and 10 s (Figure 8), which\nat a mean velocity of 0.155 m s\u00021 (Table 1) equates to\nwavelengths of 0.25, 0.62, and 1.55 m (or 0.775, 2.07, and\n5.17W, where W is the flume width (= 0.30 m)). The 10-s\nperiodicity is returned to later, but if the periodicities at 1.5\nand 4 s are examined (Figure 8), a sequencing of events is\napparent where it appears that both short- and long-period\nstructures can either follow each other (line A in Figure 8)\nor occur together (line B in Figure 8), or may \u2018\u2018merge.\u2019\u2019 This\nimplies either potential superimposition or coalescence of\nflow structures where larger structures may be created by\nthe amalgamation of numerous smaller-scale structures\n[Head and Bandyopadhyay, 1981; Smith et al., 1991] or\nthat there are smaller-scale structures superimposed upon\nthe larger-scale motions.\n[24] Here, it is suggested that the periodicity of \u000310 s is\nnot a periodicity linked to the near-bed flow at these\nReynolds numbers but is more likely to be a product of\nsecondary circulation caused by the width:depth ratio of the\nflume channel. In straight channels with an aspect ratio of\nless than 5 (flume width:flow depth, which is 1.5 in this\nstudy), turbulence anisotropy at the channel corners gen-\nerates streamwise secondary circulation that extends into the\ncentre of the channel [Nezu and Rodi, 1985]. Such channel\nwidth\u2013scale secondary flows have been speculated to have\na wavelength of \u00036W [Yalin, 1992], and the 10-s periodic-\nity, or 5.2W at Re = 13,000, appears to match this scaling.\nAlthough secondary flow is typically only a few percent of\nthe average flow velocity, it may have an important effect\non the flow structure [Colombini, 1993]. In order to remove\nthis periodicity from the time series, the dyadic number is\nreduced to 26 to give a maximum identifiable frequency of\n5.25 s. The wavelet power spectrum was then recalculated\nat heights of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 z\/h for the three different\nexperimental conditions. This further demonstrates the\nadvantage of wavelet analysis in the breakdown and under-\nstanding of a time series (Figure 9).\n[25] Analysis of several time series at different heights\nabove the bed (Figure 9) shows the same general trends as\nidentified in Figure 8, but with some subtle differences\ndependent on either location above the bed or flow Rey-\nnolds number. Three general features are apparent: (1)\nseveral different temporal scales of structure (0.5, 1, 1.5,\n2, and 4 s) are present, (2) there is an apparent sequencing\nof events, with longer-period structures following shorter-\nperiod events, and (3) flow structures of different temporal\nresolution may pass through the same point at the same\ntime. However, there appears to be greater structure and\norganization in the lower-frequency turbulence signal at\nlower Reynolds numbers. For example, if Figure 9r is\ncompared to Figure 9b, the structures with temporal perio-\ndicities of \u00034 s appear to persist throughout the 60 s at\nRe = 13,000, whereas these events are more intermittent at\nRe = 37,000. This trend is consistent throughout the flow\nFigure 8. An example of a three-dimensional wavelet power spectrum from Re = 25,000 at 0.4 z\/h for\nthe downstream u component of flow. Line A highlights a sequencing of events when either long- or\nshort-period structures can follow each other, while line B demonstrates when they can occur together.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n10 of 18\nF01003\nF\nig\nu\nre\n9\n.\nT\nh\ne\nw\nav\nel\net\np\no\nw\ner\nsp\nec\ntr\na\nfo\nr\nb\no\nth\n(a\n,\nb\n,\nc,\nd\n,\ni,\nj,\nk\n,\nl,\nq\n,\nr,\ns,\nt)\nth\ne\nu\nv\nel\no\nci\nty\nco\nm\np\no\nn\nen\nt\nan\nd\n(e\n,\nf,\ng\n,\nh\n,\nm\n,\nn\n,\no\n,\np\n,\nu\n,\nv,\nw\n,\nx\n)\nth\ne\nw\nv\nel\no\nci\nty\nco\nm\np\no\nn\nen\nt\nfo\nr\nth\nre\ne\nR\ney\nn\no\nld\ns\nn\nu\nm\nb\ner\ns:\n3\n7\n,0\n0\n0\n(F\nig\nu\nre\ns\n9\na\n\u2013\n9\nh\n),\n2\n5\n,0\n0\n0\n(F\nig\nu\nre\ns\n9\ni\u2013\n9\np\n),\nan\nd\n1\n3\n,0\n0\n0\n(F\nig\nu\nre\ns\n9\nq\n\u2013\n9\nx\n).\nT\nh\ne\nw\nav\nel\net\np\no\nw\ner\nsp\nec\ntr\na\nh\nav\ne\nth\ne\nle\nn\ng\nth\no\nf\nth\ne\nti\nm\ne\nse\nri\nes\n(6\n0\ns)\no\nn\nth\ne\nab\nsc\nis\nsa\nan\nd\nth\ne\nte\nm\np\no\nra\nl\nle\nn\ng\nth\nsc\nal\ne\n(i\nn\nse\nco\nn\nd\ns)\no\nf\nth\ne\nid\nen\nti\nfi\ned\ntu\nrb\nu\nle\nn\nt\nst\nru\nct\nu\nre\ns\no\nn\nth\ne\no\nrd\nin\nat\ne\nax\nes\n.\nT\nh\ne\nli\nn\nes\no\nn\nF\nig\nu\nre\n9\nc\nid\nen\nti\nfy\nan\nin\ncr\nea\nse\nin\nte\nm\np\no\nra\nl\nle\nn\ng\nth\nsc\nal\ne\no\nf\nst\nru\nct\nu\nre\ns\np\nas\nsi\nn\ng\nth\nro\nu\ng\nh\nth\ne\np\no\nin\nt.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n11 of 18\nF01003\ndepth. For Re = 37,000, the frequencies <1 s are dominant,\nespecially at 0.2 z\/h, while their detection is minimal for\nRe = 13,000. This suggests that the higher-frequency scales\nbecome more important, and the lower frequency less\nimportant, as the Reynolds number increases.\n[26] For Re = 37,000, there visually appears to be more\nsequencing of flow structures, especially at heights of 0.4 to\n0.8 z\/h, with frequencies from 1 to 3 s. On Figure 9c, two\nconsecutive dotted diagonal lines illustrate an increase in the\ntemporal length scales of structures passing through the\npoint, implying that larger temporal scale structures are\nforming at a location downstream. Finally, as the Reynolds\nnumber increases, especially at Re = 37,000, the 5-s\nperiodicity ceases to exist.\n[27] Although yielding a unique insight into the temporal\ndynamics of coherent flow structures over this gravel bed,\nthis form of Eulerian analysis does not enable the detection\nof changes in the entire flow field as Reynolds number\nincreases. Primarily, it is difficult to detect major changes\nthrough the profile (from 0.2 to 0.8 z\/h) as these flow\nstructures appear to influence the whole flow depth. Second,\nit is difficult to distinguish any major differences between\nthe u and w components, and the flow structures appear to be\ntwo-dimensional. Consequently, the analysis was expanded\nto study the entire flow field by calculation of the time-\naveraged wavelet power spectrum for every point in the\nfield of view, which permitted identification of the two main\npeaks in the spectrum and their associated temporal fre-\nquency (Figure 10). The most obvious difference between\nthe primary and secondary peaks is that much larger,\nspatially coherent regions of similarity are observed in the\nprimary peak. This includes a region with similar temporal\nlength scales at a height of \u00030.4 z\/h. These flow structures\nat this height have a time scale of \u00033 s for Re = 37,000, and\nthe structures decrease in both their period and the height to\nwhich they influence the flow field as the Reynolds number\ndecreases (2.5 s for Re = 25,000 and 1.5 s for Re = 13,000).\nMoreover, these bands appear clearly linked to the bed\n(Figure 10) implying that the turbulent flow structures are\ngenerated in the near-bed region and then advected into the\nflow above. This is in agreement with previous work where\nan outer zone has been defined where oscillatory structure\ngrowth and breakups predominate [Kim et al., 1971] and\nhas been classified as the wake layer [Nowell and Church,\n1979]. Furthermore, some longer periodicities (>4 s) occur\nclose to the bed, and are most detectable for Re = 13,000,\nalthough these structures do not appear to move up into the\nmain flow depth. For the secondary peak, these clearly\nFigure 10.

The\ngeometric similarity with the primary peak for Re =\n37,000 may suggest it is the same physical processes which\ngenerates these flow structures, although the influence of\nthis period on the flow field decreases at lower Reynolds\nnumbers, where it is absent at Re = 13,000. The same\n\u2018\u2018streaky\u2019\u2019 patterns of structures, originating from the bed\nand moving up into the flow, are observed, with the\ntemporal scale of these structures depending greatly on\nthe local bed structure.\n[28] In order to collapse the data displayed in Figure 10,\nthe time frequencies have been grouped into wavelet\nfrequency time bins (a nonlinear scale) in Figure 11.\nCollapsing the signal using this approach enables detection\nof the frequency of the formative mechanisms generating\nthese coherent flow structures, with the results being pre-\nsented as a percentage, for each time bin, of the total\nnumber of structures detected. For the primary peak, it is\nclear that the dominant periodicity is \u00032 s and is present at\nall three Reynolds numbers, although its contribution to the\ntotal number of structures decreases from 15% at Re =\n13,000 to 10% at Re = 37,000. Furthermore, as the Reynolds\nnumber increases toRe = 37,000, higher-frequency structures\nFigure 11.

However, the\nmost dominant change as Reynolds number increases is the\nappearance of a period at \u00033 s that makes the distribution\nbimodal. More subtle trends can be observed in the sec-\nondary peak data in Figures 9d\u20139f, similar to that revealed\nin the analysis of secondary peaks shown in Figure 10.\nStructures with a frequency of \u00032 s are detected for all three\nReynolds numbers (Figures 11d\u201311f) with shorter-frequency\nstructures, again at \u00031.25 s, also being present. The\napparent contribution of the \u00031.25-s structures in the\nsecondary peaks appears to decrease as the Reynolds\nnumber increases, again with the appearance of a \u00030.75-s\nfrequency at Re = 37,000. Thus, although the magnitude\nof the contribution from these structures changes with\nReynolds number, the \u00032-s periodicity is detected at all\nReynolds numbers, and suggests that the same formative\nmechanism is generating the coherent flow structures.\nFurthermore, it appears that as the Reynolds number\nexceeds a critical threshold, additional processes influence\nthe generation of the flow field and these periodicities are\nexamined below through the application of existing scaling\nlaws.\n[29] Several different generalized relationships have been\nproposed to calculate dimensionless numbers that define the\nperiod of large-scale turbulence and aid understanding of\nthe overall turbulence signature, such as the boil periodicity\nsuggested by Jackson [1976], the Strouhal relationship\n[Levi, 1983, 1991] or vortex and wake flapping frequencies\nproposed by Simpson [1989]. The underlying problem with\nall of these relationships is that the flow reattachment point\nis extremely difficult to determine [Nelson and Smith, 1989;\nKostaschuk, 2000; Best and Kostaschuk, 2002], and this is\nmade even more problematic over a gravel bed because of\nvortices merging into a continuous shear layer. However,\nSimpson [1989] proposed two scaling relations: for vortex\nshedding\nfv \u00bc 0:6U=Xr; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere fv is vortex frequency, U is the mean velocity, and Xr\nis the mean length of the separation zone, and for wake\nflapping\nfw < 0:1U=Xr: \u00f02\u00de\nFigure 11 provides an approximation of the frequency(s) for\nthe identifiable peaks (0.75, 1.5, 2, and 3 s, which equates to\n1.3, 0.8, 0.5, and 0.3 Hz). Furthermore, analysis of the DEM\n(Figure 1) shows that the maximum particle length in the\ngravel matrix is 0.14 m and the maximum height is 0.062 m.\nIf equations (1) and (2) are rearranged to calculate the\nreattachment length by using the hydraulic conditions given\nin Table 2, a second-order approximation of processes\ngenerating the turbulent flow field can be deduced (Table 3).\n[30] By applying the scaling laws to the four identified\nfrequencies and three hydraulic conditions, the calculated\nmean lengths of flow separation from wake flapping are\nbetween 0.01 and 0.13 m. It is suggested that these are\nTable 3.

A schematic model of flow over a gravel bed at two Reynolds numbers. At low Re, isolated\nseparation zones develop in the leeside of large anchor clasts, and both eddy shedding and wake flapping\nproduce a region of higher turbulence at \u00030.4 z\/h (at the level of quadrant labels (Q1\u2013Q4)). At higher Re,\na region of near-bed skimming flow is created because of interacting separation zones, and larger\ncoherent flow structures are generated that extend farther above the bed, are steeper in the upstream\nangle, and have a longer period. These flow structures produce a region of higher turbulence at \u00030.5\u2013\n0.6 z\/h (at level of quadrant labels (Q1\u2013Q4)). At each Re, note the superimposition and amalgamation of\ndifferent temporal and spatial scales of flow structure and the origin of the large-scale turbulence\nassociated with the major bed roughness. Colors denote approximate streamwise velocities, with low-\nvelocity flow associated with flow near the bed, and the large-scale flow structures showing low-velocity\nregions toward the back (upstream) side of the flow structure. The size of the coils reflects the intensity of\nthe structure.\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n14 of 18\nF01003\nreasonable length scales for flows over such complex\nheterogeneous topography with a median particle height\nof 0.02 m and maximum particle length of 0.14 m. Because\nof the several (temporal) scales of turbulence that have been\nidentified (Figures 10 and 11) and the apparent amalgam-\nation of flow structures into an intense band of turbulence\n(Figure 6), it may not be possible to separate individual\nprocesses of coherent flow structure generation. This is due\nto the complex bed topography, where each topographic\nprotrusion generates its own flow field and the considerable\npositive feedback between bed form topography and the\ngeneration of flow structures.\n[31] However, as demonstrated in Figure 11, the 2-s\nstructure is prevalent for all three Reynolds numbers. The\nmean lengths of flow separation calculated for wake flap-\nping range from 0.03 to 0.09 m as the Reynolds number\nincreases. Furthermore, when the w component of mean\nflow (Figure 2) and turbulence intensity (Figure 6) are\nstudied, flow structures with length scales of the same order\nof magnitude are identified. As discussed previously, flow\nstructures with a length scale of \u00030.04 m are clearly\ndetected in the time-averaged images. These flow structures\nare intermittent and therefore the whole structure will not\nnecessarily be detectable in a time-averaged analysis, since\nthe patterns of structure motion would not be regular.\nHowever, the point from where these structures are initiated\nand generated will be consistent. The same observations can\nbe made in the plots of turbulence intensity (regions A and\nB in Figure 6) where regions of \u00030.07 m length with high\nturbulence intensity are detected behind protruding clasts.\nThus, these structures may be associated with wake flapping\nclose to the bed and its interaction with the protruding\ntopography. This follows classical hydraulic theory that\nwould suggest that as flow approaches an obstacle, a\nlocalized area of low flow velocity develops in front of\nthe topographic protrusion and a suppressed saddle point\nvortex forms [Hunt et al., 1978]. This flow thus moves\naround such topographic protrusions in the form of tertiary\nvortices [Hunt et al., 1978] and it is reasoned that these,\ntogether with wake flapping associated with the leeside flow\nseparation zone shear layer, may form the coherent flow\nstructures documented herein. This mechanism is possible\nfor all four identified frequencies, with wake flapping\nreattachment lengths ranging from 0.01 to 0.13 m. Finally,\nat Re = 37,000, shorter periodicities are identified, which\nprovides an average vortex shedding reattachment length of\n0.19 m, similar to that identified at this Reynolds number in\nFigure 2.\n5. Discussion\n[32] This analysis has examined the characteristics of\nturbulent flow generated over known gravel bed topography\nat three different flow Reynolds numbers. The analysis has\ndetected coherent flow structures with defined spatial and\ntemporal characteristics that scale with the flow Reynolds\nnumber. As the Reynolds number increases (Figure 12)\n(1) the visual distinctiveness of the flow structures becomes\nmore defined through the flow depth, (2) the upstream slope\nof the coherent flow structure increases in angle, (3) the\nreduction in streamwise flow velocity, and turbulence\nintensity, toward the upstream side of the structure\nincreases, and (4) the spacing between these coherent flow\nstructures increases. The source of these structures is\nidentified through examination of the mean and turbulent\nintensity values, as well as by quadrant analysis. Analysis of\nthe mean u and w components identifies flow recirculation\nover short distances (\u00030.03 m) that is generated by flow\nseparation associated with individual clasts. In addition, a\nsecondary \u2018\u2018reattachment structure\u2019\u2019 is identified in the\nw component with a length scale of \u00030.1 m. This localized\nseparation and reattachment is further identified in the\nturbulence intensity plots where the greatest turbulence\nintensity is detected in the near-bed region. At higher\nReynolds numbers, a continuous band of high turbulence\nintensity is formed that appears linked to the amalgamation\nof shear layers associated with flow separation around the\nlarger clasts, thus forming a more unified region of higher\nturbulence intensity at \u00030.2 z\/h. By 0.5 z\/h, the turbulence\nintensity becomes comparable for all three Reynolds numb-\ners. Finally, in the near-bed region, quadrant analysis\nidentifies alternating patterns of quadrant 2 (stoss side)\nand quadrant 4 (lee side) events, again demonstrating\nlocalized bed\/topographic forcing of the flow. Furthermore,\na band of quadrant 2 events are detected higher in the flow,\nmost likely formed by large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz insta-\nbilities along a shear layer [e.g., Bennett and Best, 1995;\nBest, 2005]. A similar pattern is observed in quadrant 1\n(stoss side) and quadrant 3 (lee side) events in the near-bed\nregion, which suggests that as the flow approaches the\nparticle, it decelerates or reverses close to the bed, but\notherwise accelerates as it is forced over (or around) the\nparticle. Localized flow deceleration occurs in the separa-\ntion zones that form downstream of the large anchor clasts:\nflow within these separation zones recirculates, forming a\nbody-fitted vortex, and a shear layer that extends down-\nstream is associated with each of the clast lee sides.\n[33] Wavelet analysis has enabled the temporal length\nscales of the turbulent signatures to be identified. Decom-\nposing the selected time series in the temporal domain\nidentified general trends which included (1) several differ-\nent dominant temporal scales of flow structure (0.5, 1, 1.5,\n2, and 4 s), (2) an apparent sequencing of events, with\nlonger-period structures following shorter-period events,\nand (3) flow structures of different temporal resolution\npassing through the same point at the same time. When\nthe signal is decomposed and analyzed, for the whole\nimage, by detecting the primary and secondary peaks in\nthe wavelet power spectrum, the time scales of the dominant\nflow structures can be identified. The most obvious differ-\nence between the primary and secondary peaks is that much\nlarger, spatially coherent regions of similarity are observed\nin the primary peak, and includes a region with similar\ntemporal length scales at a height of \u00030.4 z\/h. The flow\nstructures at this height have a time scale of \u00033 s for Re =\n37,000 but, as the Reynolds number decreases, are seen to\ndecrease in both their temporal scale (2.5 s for Re = 25,000\nand 1.5 s for Re = 13,000) and the height above the bed at\nwhich they influence the flow field. These bands appear\nlinked to the bed (lines A and B in Figure 8), suggesting that\nturbulent flow structures are generated in the near-bed\nregion and then entrained into the flow above. If this\nF01003 HARDY ET AL.: FLOW STRUCTURES OVER A GRAVEL SURFACE\n15 of 18\nF01003\nanalysis is extended, the distribution of turbulent length\nscales identifies a 2-s flow structure that is prevalent at all\nthree Reynolds numbers. By applying standard scaling\nlaws, the mean lengths of flow separation calculated for\nwake flapping range from 0.03 to 0.09 m and increase at\nhigher Reynolds numbers.\n[34] The results obtained in this analysis agree with\nprevious work in which the development of the flow\nstructure has been found to be proportional to the flow\nvelocity (i.e., Reynolds number if flow depth is kept\nconstant [Shvidchenko and Pender, 2001]), and identifies\nstructures similar to the classical bursting phenomenon in\nwhich low-momentum fluid is ejected from the bed [Grass,\n1971; Talmon et al., 1986; Shen and Lemmin, 1999].\nHowever, the present study shows that these flow structures\ndevelop over the large anchor clasts in the bed, potentially\nby wake flapping. Studies of turbulent boundary layers over\nflat surfaces have also suggested a change in the form and\nangle of hairpin vortices dependent on the flow Reynolds\nnumber [Head and Bandyopadhyay, 1981], with the hairpin\nvortices becoming stretched and narrower at higher Re. At\nhigher Reynolds numbers, the number of hairpins traversing\nthe boundary layer was found to decrease, although the\nvortices still penetrated through the entire boundary layer,\nand can merge to form \u2018\u2018packets\u2019\u2019 of hairpin vortices [e.g.,\nChristensen and Adrian, 2001]. Over rough surfaces, these\nflow structures appear to merge into a single layer, which\nimplies that skimming flow [Grass, 1971; Grass et al.,\n1991; Krogstad et al., 1992] generated over the largest\nroughness elements tends to dominate as the Reynolds\nnumber increases, and may form large-scale vorticity. The\npresent study illustrates that the origin of these larger-scale\nmotions are Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities generated along\nthe separation zone shear layer [e.g., Mu\u00a8ller and Gyr, 1982,\n1986; Rood and Hickin, 1989; Bennett and Best, 1995; Best,\n2005], thus forming a region defined as where oscillatory\nstructure growth and breakups predominate [Kim et al.,\n1971] and which has previously been classified as the wake\nlayer (wake flapping) [Nowell and Church, 1979]. This\nimplies the creation of larger-scale flow structures by either\npotential superimposition, or coalescence, of numerous\nsmaller-scale structures [Head and Bandyopadhyay, 1981;\nSmith et al., 1991], or where smaller-scale structures exist\nupon larger-scale structures. Thus, our present analysis\nsuggests that coherent flow structures over gravels owe\ntheir origin to bed-generated turbulence and that large-scale\nouter layer structures are the result of flow-topography\ninteractions in the near-bed region associated with wake\nflapping.\n6. Conclusions\n[35] Turbulent flows moving over a gravel bed develop\nlarge-scale, macroturbulent flow structures that are initiated\nat the bed, and grow and dissipate as they move upward\nthrough the flow depth. These large-scale flow structures\nchange their form and magnitude at higher Reynolds\nnumbers, becoming more distinct, with a clearer velocity\nsignature and steeper upstream-dipping slopes. This study\nshows that the near-bed flow controls the flow structure fed\ninto the outer flow and that macroturbulence over gravel\nbeds is sourced from these flow-bed interactions. These\nlarge-scale coherent flow structures are separated by regions\nof higher than average streamwise velocity, and define\nregions that are dominated by quadrant 2 and quadrant 1\nevents, which are interspersed with regions dominated by\nquadrant 4 and quadrant 3 events. At low Reynolds numb-\ners, flow over the gravel surface is found to possess distinct\nregions of flow separation in the leeside of individual clasts,\nbut as Reynolds number increases and the length of the flow\nrecirculation zones grows, then these amalgamate to form a\nlayer of skimming flow near the bed. Turbulence associated\nwith both eddy shedding and wake flapping in the leeside of\nthese clasts creates the larger-scale coherent turbulent\nmotions, which may amalgamate to form a region of higher\nturbulence intensity at a dimensionless height away from\nthe bed, z\/h, of \u00030.5 at higher Reynolds numbers. Super-\nimposition of such motions appears to create the conditions\nnecessary for the formation of large-scale coherent flow\nstructures that can advect through the entire flow depth.\nWavelet analysis has been shown to be a powerful tool in\ndeciphering the complex signatures of such large-scale\nmotions, and shows that these organized motions have\nlonger periods at higher Reynolds numbers and penetrate\nfurther into the outer flow. The occurrence of several\ntemporal scales of structure, and their presence at the same\ntime, suggest the superimposition and amalgamation of\nsmaller-scale flow structures to create this large-scale\nturbulence.\n[36] Future work clearly needs to investigate further the\nexact nature of such superimposition, amalgamation and\nvortex evolution, and investigate the links between the\ngrowth and dissipation of these structures, and both sedi-\nment suspension and bed load transport. The interactions\nbetween such flow structures and sediment entrainment\nholds the key for understanding and predicting the transport\nand fate of a range of different size and composition\nparticles both above, at, and within the bed of gravel\nsubstrates.\n[37] Acknowledgments.
