More research is required to understand 16 \nhow mentally tough athletes (in comparison to less tough athletes) maintain control and 17 \nhigh levels of performance in stressful circumstances.     18 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 3\nIntroduction 1 \nUntil recently, the literature on mental toughness has suffered from a number of inherent 2 \nweaknesses, and was generally characterized by a lack of conceptual clarity (Crust, 2007; 3 \nJones, Hanton, & Connaughton, 2002). Mental toughness has been described as one of the 4 \nmost overused, but least understood terms in applied sport psychology (Jones et al., 2002). 5 \nHowever, a recent surge of interest, and more rigorous scientific investigations into what is 6 \npotentially one of the most important psychological attributes in sport, has led to somewhat 7 \ngreater clarity (Crust, 2007). Emerging research suggests that mental toughness is multi-8 \nfaceted, and an important psychological construct that is related to successful sport 9 \nperformance (Bull, Shambrook, James, & Brooks, 2005; Crust & Clough, 2005; Clough, 10 \nEarle, & Sewell, 2002; Gucciari, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008; Jones, Hanton, & 11 \nConnaughton, 2007).  12 \nDespite researchers such as Jones et al. (2002, 2007) and Clough et al. (2002) using 13 \ndifferent approaches (both qualitative and quantitative) to study mental toughness, Crust 14 \n(2008) highlights numerous similarities in the outcomes of these and other studies. For 15 \nexample, Clough et al. proposed the 4C\u2019s model of mental toughness comprising of: (1) 16 \ncontrol (emotional and life), which concerns a tendency to feel and act as if one is 17 \ninfluential, (2) commitment, which reflects deep involvement with whatever one is doing, 18 \n(3) challenge, the extent to which individuals seek out opportunities for personal 19 \ndevelopment, (4) confidence (in abilities and interpersonal), reflecting a high sense of self 20 \nbelief and an unshakeable faith in having the ability to achieve success. Similarly, Jones et 21 \nal. (2007) reported attributes of mental toughness to include awareness and control of 22 \nthoughts and feelings, and staying focused (comparable to control), using long-term goals 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 4\nas a source of motivation (analogous to commitment), pushing to the limit (similar to 1 \nchallenge) and having an unshakeable self-belief (comparable to confidence). According to 2 \nCrust (2007), other important attributes that characterize mental toughness include coping 3 \neffectively with pressure and adversity, recovering or rebounding from set-backs and 4 \nfailures, persisting or refusing to quit, being insensitive or resilient, thriving on pressure 5 \nand possession of superior mental skills. In support of their own model of mental 6 \ntoughness, Clough et al. (2002, p.38) suggested: 7 \nMentally tough individuals tend to be sociable and outgoing; as they are able to 8 \nremain calm and relaxed, they are competitive in many situations and have lower 9 \nanxiety levels than others. With a high sense of self-belief and an unshakeable faith 10 \nthat they can control their own destiny, these individuals can remain relatively 11 \nunaffected by competition or adversity. 12 \n The definition of Clough et al. (2002) emphasizes mental toughness as a stress 13 \nbuffer that is influential in pressurized and adverse situations. However, recent researchers 14 \nhave suggested that defining mental toughness in terms of reactions or responses to 15 \nadversity is somewhat limiting as the construct appears to encompass enabling factors that 16 \nhelp to maintain focus and motivation when things are going well (Gucciari et al., 2008). 17 \nThere is still much debate concerning whether mental toughness is more stable and trait-18 \nlike, or a set of context specific cognitive skills that can be manipulated through training 19 \n(cf. Crust, 2008). Jones et al. (2007, p. 247) suggest mental toughness may be \u2018natural or 20 \ndeveloped\u2019 which appears to correspond with more recent understanding of the importance 21 \nof both nature and nurture (cf. Golby & Sheard, 2006). Recent research has shown 22 \nsignificant increases in the mental toughness of elite adolescent swimmers in response to a 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 5\n7-week psychological skills training programme (Sheard & Golby, 2006) although it 1 \nremains likely that mental toughness is at least partially inherited. Recent research that 2 \nstudied adult monogygotic and dizygotic twins (Horsburgh, Schermer, Vesleka, & Vernon, 3 \n2009) has revealed that individual differences in mental toughness were largely attributable 4 \nto genetic and non-shared environmental factors.   5 \nOne of the most important attributes of mentally tough athletes appears to be the 6 \navoidance of performance decrement due to damaging negative emotions and subsequent 7 \nloss of focus, through the maintenance of psychological control in adverse circumstances or 8 \npressure situations (Bull et al., 2005; Clough et al., 2002; Crust, 2007; Golby, Sheard & van 9 \nWersch, 2007; Jones et al., 2002). A number of researchers have specifically emphasized 10 \nthe importance of emotional control (Clough et al., 2002; Loehr, 1995) which appears to 11 \nreflect self-regulation, keeping emotions such as anxiety in check, and not revealing ones 12 \nemotions to other people. Emotional control appeared to be what Clough et al. had in mind 13 \nwhen manipulating feedback given to participants with high and low levels of mental 14 \ntoughness. These researchers evaluated mental toughness with their own inventory 15 \n(MTQ48) and gave either positive or negative feedback to participants following a battery 16 \nof physical tasks. These researchers reported a significant interaction between mental 17 \ntoughness and feedback when testing the performance of participants on a follow-up 18 \ncognitive planning task. The performance of participants who scored high on the MTQ48 19 \nremained constant regardless of feedback, while participants with lower MTQ48 scores 20 \nshowed more variable responses that appeared to correspond to the type of feedback given 21 \n(positive or negative).  Specifically, participants with lower MTQ48 scores performed 22 \nsignificantly worse on a cognitive planning task following negative feedback.  23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 6\nOne explanation of these findings concerns the typical reactions of participants to 1 \nemotion-provoking stimuli. In essence, the possibility remains that based on levels of 2 \nmental toughness, participants interpret the feedback differently, and this likely influenced 3 \nattention, and subsequent task performance. Other than recent research that found small but 4 \nsignificant positive correlations between mental toughness and approach coping strategies, 5 \nand negative correlations with avoidance coping (Nicholls, Polman, Levy & Backhouse, 6 \n2008), little is known about the specific cognitive processes that are related to mental 7 \ntoughness, and whether differences exist between individuals with high or low levels of 8 \nmental toughness. However, Crust and Azadi (in press) recently examined the relationship 9 \nbetween mental toughness and athletes\u2019 use of psychological strategies, using the MTQ48 10 \nto measure mental toughness and the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS; Thomas, 11 \nMurphy & Hardy, 1999) to evaluate use of psychological strategies. Crust and Azadi found 12 \nsignificant and positive correlations between mental toughness and use of a number of 13 \npsychological strategies including self-talk, relaxation and emotional control.  14 \n Outside of sport, Larsen and colleagues (Larsen, Diener & Emmons, 1986; Larsen, 15 \nDiener & Cropanzano, 1987) have studied individual differences in emotional responses to 16 \nidentical emotion-provoking stimuli. These researchers found that some individuals 17 \nconsistently manifest stronger or more intense emotional responses than do others, and 18 \nrefer to this individual difference dimension as affect intensity. Larsen et al. (1986) had 62 19 \nundergraduate students report two events per day, and their affective responses to these 20 \nevents over an 8-week period. A team of coders was used to objectively determine how 21 \ngood or bad each event was. In a second study, the same researchers asked 187 participants 22 \nto describe how they would react to standardized life event descriptions. In both studies 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 7\nparticipants completed the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM; Larsen, 1984) and were divided 1 \ninto high and low affect intensity groups on the basis of their responses. In both studies, 2 \nparticipants with high levels of affect intensity responded to actual and hypothetical events 3 \nwith significantly more intense affective reactions.  4 \nLarsen et al. (1987) provided empirical support to explain differences in affect 5 \nintensity based upon underlying cognitive operations. Undergraduate psychology students 6 \n(n = 280) were categorized as either high or low in affect intensity based on responses to 7 \nthe AIM (Larsen, 1984). Participants viewed affect-relevant slides and were asked to 8 \ncomplete a questionnaire to assess the cognitive operations that were undertaken in 9 \nevaluating the positive and negative images. Specifically, individuals with high affect 10 \nintensity tended to engage in more personalizing (i.e., absorbed in personal meaning), 11 \ngeneralizing (i.e. blowing things out of proportion) and selective abstraction (i.e. focus on 12 \nemotional aspects of events).  13 \nSome researchers such as Cooper and McConville (1993) have questioned the 14 \nvalidity of the construct and suggested affect intensity actually reflects a mixture of trait 15 \nneuroticism and extraversion. However, such arguments are not convincing given that 16 \nneuroticism and extraversion together predict less than 30% of the variance in measures of 17 \naffect intensity (cf. Schimmack & Diener, 1997). Schimmack and Diener provided strong 18 \nevidence to suggest that affect intensity is a valid construct and cannot be reduced to 19 \nextraversion and neuroticism in a series of studies evaluating affective responses of 20 \nundergraduate psychology students to both real (via diaries detailing experienced emotions) 21 \nand hypothetical situations. Schimmack and Diener found extraversion to correlate with the 22 \nintensity of pleasant affect while neuroticism related to intensity of unpleasant affect. 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 8\nAdditionally, extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated and therefore could 1 \nnot explain significant and positive correlations between intensity of pleasant and 2 \nunpleasant affect. These researchers suggested it was untenable to define individuals high 3 \nin affect intensity as neurotic extraverts. These findings support the supposition that 4 \nindividuals who experience intense pleasant affect also tend to experience intense 5 \nunpleasant affect. Schimmack and Diener found that affect intensity and affect frequency 6 \nscores were largely unrelated and that affect intensity is best conceptualized as a disposition 7 \nto react strongly to emotion-eliciting events.     8 \n     Bull et al. (2005) suggest that one important facet of mental toughness is tough 9 \nthinking, and propose that most applied sport psychology work focuses on developing this 10 \naspect. To these researchers, tough thinking represents the translation of more general 11 \ncharacter and attitudes into a competitive environment, with mentally tough performers 12 \nable to apply tough thinking at critical moments. Indeed, maintaining perspective which 13 \nappears central to tough thinking, seems to be diametrically opposite to the cognitive 14 \noperations of individuals with high affect intensity, who tend to over-react to emotional 15 \nstimuli by \u2018blowing things out of proportion\u2019. Given this, it is possible that mental 16 \ntoughness and affect intensity are negatively related, and this hypothesis was tested in the 17 \nfollowing research. 18 \n The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between mental 19 \ntoughness and affect intensity. It is possible that participants with low levels of mental 20 \ntoughness have to deal with greater emotional disturbance due to characteristically 21 \naugmenting emotion-provoking stimuli. Thus, the ability of mentally tough individuals to 22 \nremain unaffected by competition or adversity could in part be explained by having less 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 9\nintense emotional reactions (thus less cognitive disturbance), rather than (or as well as) 1 \nhaving developed or learned more effective coping strategies. If mental toughness and 2 \naffect intensity are found to be related, then future researchers will have an established 3 \ntheoretical base from which to proceed in evaluating the cognitive operations of mentally 4 \ntough individuals.   5 \n 6 \nMethod 7 \nParticipants 8 \nThe sample consisted of 112 sport participants (55 men and 57 women) who regularly (at 9 \nleast twice per week) attended various sports and fitness clubs \/ activities at a university in 10 \nthe north of England. The heterogeneous sample included basketball, association football, 11 \nhockey, gymnastics, netball, badminton, golf, long distance running and triathlon 12 \nparticipants, who ranged from recreational sport participants to national level athletes. 13 \nRecently there have been calls to study mental toughness among cohorts of varying 14 \nsporting backgrounds and abilities (Crust, 2008; Gucciardi et al., 2008) rather than 15 \ncontinuing to focus upon elite athletes. A mixed sample was deemed appropriate in order to 16 \nmore fully understand potential relationships within a broader population. The use of a 17 \nheterogeneous sample appears to be similar to the recent approach taken by Nicholls et al. 18 \n(2008). The mean age of men and women were found to be 30.1 years (s = 11.6) and 28.6 19 \nyears (s = 8.9) respectively, with participants ages ranging from 18-51 years. The 20 \nparticipants had all been participating in a minimum of two sports sessions a week, for at 21 \nleast six months.  22 \n 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 10\nInstruments 1 \nMental Toughness 2 \nThe MTQ48 (Clough et al., 2002), was used to measure mental toughness. Responses are 3 \nmade to the 48-items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree, to (5) 4 \nstrongly agree, with an average completion time between 10 and 15 minutes (Crust & 5 \nClough, 2005). The MTQ48 has an overall test-retest coefficient of 0.9. In the present 6 \nstudy, overall Cronbach\u2019s Alpha for the MTQ48 (0.86) was found to be consistent with 7 \nprevious research (Nicholls et al., 2008). More recently, researchers have reported the 8 \nMTQ48 to have adequate psychometric properties, and both exploratory and confirmatory 9 \nfactor analysis has been found to support the proposed structure of the inventory 10 \n(Horsburgh, et al., 2009). Clough et al. (2002) have provided evidence for the construct 11 \nvalidity of the MTQ48 with significant relationships reported with optimism, self-image, 12 \nlife satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trait anxiety. In respect of criterion validity, Clough et al. 13 \nfound that participants with self-reported high, as opposed to low mental toughness gave 14 \nlower rating of exertion during a 30-minute physically demanding cycling task. The 15 \nMTQ48 has been found to correlate with pain tolerance (Crust & Clough, 2005) and a short 16 \nversion of the questionnaire has been shown to relate to injury rehabilitation (Levy, 17 \nPolman, Clough, Marchant & Earle, 2006) with more positive threat appraisals, better 18 \ncoping with pain, and greater attendance at rehabilitation clinics associated with higher 19 \nlevels of mental toughness.  20 \n 21 \nAffect Intensity      22 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 11\n To determine levels of emotional reactivity, the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM- 1 \nLarsen, 1984) was completed by each participant. This 40-item inventory assesses the 2 \ncharacteristic intensity with which an individual typically experiences emotions. Items are 3 \nrated on a 6-point scale, with verbal anchors ranging from (1) never, to (6) always, with 4 \nscoring achieved by averaging the responses across the 40-items. Larsen (1984) reported 5 \nhigh coefficient alpha (Cronbach, 1951) for the AIM across four samples (0.9 \u2013 0.94). In 6 \nrespect of construct validity, Larsen also reported a significant correlation r = 0.5 (p<0.01) 7 \nbetween Affect Intensity and reports of typical affect response intensity by the parents of 8 \nparticipants. The AIM has also been found to correlate significantly (r = 0.52-0.61) with the 9 \naverage intensity of daily moods assessed over several months, and with measures of 10 \nperipheral physiological arousal (r  =  -0.32) which suggest high-AIM participants are 11 \nphysiologically under aroused in quiet, stimulus reduced environments (cf. Larsen et al., 12 \n1986). Tests of stability (test-retest correlations) after 1-, 2-, and 3 months were found to be 13 \n0.8, 0.81 and 0.81 respectively. Larsen et al. (1986) reports that across several samples, the 14 \nAIM has been found to correlate most consistently with sociability, arousability, and 15 \nemotionality.   16 \n 17 \nProcedures 18 \nA variety of coaches and instructor s at a north of England University were approached in 19 \norder to gain permission to solicit volunteers for the present research. The largest group of 20 \nparticipants was drawn from a circuit training class that included a wide variety of sport 21 \nand exercise participants, and a large number of sports participants who were using the 22 \nsession to maintain or increase their sport-related fitness. Instructors gave permission for 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 12\nparticipants to be sought, and allowed the author to address the group prior to training 1 \nclasses. The aims and objectives of the research were briefly stated, and issues of 2 \nconfidentiality were broached. This approach led to 112 volunteers agreeing to participate 3 \nin the present study. All participants read, and signed informed consent forms prior to 4 \ncompleting a booklet containing a copy of the MTQ48 (Clough et al., 2002) and the AIM 5 \nquestionnaire (Larsen, 1984). Completed booklets were placed into envelopes, sealed, and 6 \ncollected by the instructor or the author. Ethical clearance for this research was achieved 7 \nthrough a University research ethics committee.   8 \n 9 \nData Analysis 10 \nTo test the relationship between mental toughness and affect intensity, Pearson Product 11 \nMoment Correlations were computed between affect intensity, overall mental toughness 12 \nand the six subscales of the MTQ48 questionnaire. Correlations were also computed to 13 \nassess any relationship between mental toughness, affect intensity and age. Finally, 14 \nindependent t-tests were used to test for possible gender differences, and differences 15 \nrelating to performance levels of the participants in mental toughness and affect intensity. 16 \nData screening was used to ensure all dependent variables met the assumptions necessary 17 \nfor the use of parametric statistics.    18 \n 19 \nResults 20 \nDescriptive data for responses to the MTQ48 and AIM questionnaire can be viewed in 21 \nTable 1. Measures of skewness and kurtosis found the data to be normally distributed. A 22 \nseries of Pearson correlations between affect intensity, overall mental toughness, and the 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 13\nsix subscales of mental toughness found no significant (p > .05) relationships (cf. Table 2). 1 \nAge was also found to be unrelated to mental toughness (r = -.15, p > .05) and affect 2 \nintensity (r = -.11, p > .05). Independent t-tests found no significant differences (p > .05) in 3 \noverall mental toughness, the mental toughness subscales or affect intensity between men 4 \nand women. Finally, a series of independent t-tests were used to test for differences in 5 \nmental toughness and affect intensity between recreational athletes (n = 49), and athletes 6 \nwho had competed at club level or higher (n = 63). Bonferroni corrections were used to 7 \nadjust p values because of using multiple comparisons and no significant differences were 8 \nfound between recreational or club level athletes.  9 \n 10 \nDiscussion 11 \nThe aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that mental toughness and affect 12 \nintensity were significantly and negatively related. Previous research has not excluded the 13 \npossibility that mentally tough athletes are able to remain calm in pressurized situations due 14 \nto experiencing less intense emotions. Results suggest that mental toughness and affect 15 \nintensity are not linearly related. In the context of developing a greater understanding of 16 \nmental toughness, this is an important finding. If mental toughness and affect intensity were 17 \nfound to negatively correlate, then the possibility would have remained that mentally tough 18 \nindividuals experienced less intense emotions in response to a given level of emotion 19 \nprovoking stimuli; which might have explained the ability of such individuals to remain 20 \nrelatively unaffected by pressure or adversity. However, the present findings coupled with 21 \nprevious evidence of a relationship between mental toughness and coping (Nicholls et al., 22 \n2008), and mental toughness and use of psychological strategies (Crust & Azadi, in press) 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 14\nappears to give some credence to those researchers and theorists (Clough et al., 2002; 1 \nLoehr, 1995) who contend that emotional control is a vital component of mental toughness. 2 \nIf mentally tough athletes have similarly intense emotional experiences as other athletes, it 3 \nappears appropriate to examine if, and how mentally tough athletes differ in the way they 4 \nmanage their emotions. However, given that the present study did not assess emotional 5 \ncontrol or coping it is clear that further research will be necessary to confirm the 6 \nimportance of such factors as other potential causal explanations remain possible.     7 \nIf mentally tough individuals do not characteristically experience differences in 8 \naffect intensity, it is possible that such individuals are exerting more effective control over 9 \nexperienced emotions. This could implicate a number of possible mechanisms such as 10 \nattention, differences in cognitive operations or more general coping strategies, although it 11 \nis possible that these explanations are not mutually exclusive. In relation to attention, Jones 12 \net al. (2007) reported mentally tough athletes to totally focus on the task at hand, remain 13 \ncommitted to a self-absorbed focus, and focus on processes not solely outcomes. Directing 14 \nattention is such ways is likely to avoid being distracted by pleasant or unpleasant recent 15 \nexperiences. Furthermore, the view that cognitive operations might be one explanation of 16 \nemotional control is supported in a recent study (Crust & Azadi, in press) that employed the 17 \nMTQ48 and the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS; Thomas et al., 1999). Crust and 18 \nAzadi found significant correlations between mental toughness and use of a number of 19 \npsychological strategies including self-talk, relaxation and emotional control. 20 \nUnfortunately, the emotional control subscale of the TOPS does not reflect how 21 \nparticipants achieved control.  22 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 15\nThe recent work of Nicholls et al. (2008) appears to suggest some relationships 1 \nbetween mental toughness and the use of problem or approach coping strategies (mental 2 \nimagery, effort expenditure, thought control, and logical analysis), although only modest 3 \ncorrelations were reported (highest r = 0.3 between mental toughness and logical analysis). 4 \nIn recent research concerning mental toughness in Australian Football, elite coaches with 5 \nsignificant playing experience highlighted the importance of \u2018the ability to manage your 6 \nemotions to enhance performance\u2019 (Gucciardi et al., 2008, p. 272). Furthermore, Crust, 7 \nNesti and Bond (2008) reported that mentally tough long-distance walkers showed a 8 \nflexible approach to coping (using strategies interchangeably to suit the circumstances) and 9 \nemployed strategies such as compartmentalizing the problem, objective thinking, and 10 \nmaintaining perspective.   11 \nIf the goal of the practitioner is to intervene and help individuals develop mental 12 \ntoughness, then a greater understanding of the cognitive operations underlying the concept 13 \nis required. However, recent research concerning psychological resilience might offer an 14 \nappropriate framework and theoretical perspective in which to further understand mental 15 \ntoughness and any relationship with emotions. Tugade, Fredrickson, and Feldman-Barrett 16 \n(2004) suggest that resilient individuals tend to be better at harnessing positive emotions in 17 \ntimes of stress and thus reap beneficial effects in relation to coping. These researchers 18 \nconsidered psychological resilience in context of the broaden-and-build theory of positive 19 \nemotions (Fredrickson, 1998), which suggests that positive (as opposed to negative) 20 \nemotions can momentarily allow broader thinking, flexible attention, and thus more varied 21 \nbehavioral repertoires. Tugade et al. (2004) found that resilient individuals were not blind 22 \nto negativity and did experience high levels of anxiety and frustration yet were able to 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 16\nexperience positive emotions during stressful circumstances. It is suggested that with 1 \nrepeatedly experiencing positive emotions, a broadened mindset becomes habitual and 2 \nhelps to build an individual\u2019s personal resources. Efforts to consider mental toughness in 3 \nthe context of the broaden-and-build theory are likely to complement existing work that has 4 \nexplored the relationship between mental toughness and coping (Nicholls et al., 2008). 5 \nIt is interesting to note that no significant differences were found between men and 6 \nwomen in regards to overall levels of mental toughness or affect intensity. This concurs 7 \nwith Clough et al. (2002) who reported that the MTQ48 did not discriminate across gender. 8 \nDescriptive data for measures of mental toughness and affect intensity appear to be similar 9 \nto previously reported normative data. With respect to affect intensity, the reported mean in 10 \nthe present research (3.7) is within the normal range reported by Larsen et al. (1987). The 11 \nmean mental toughness rating (173) is consistent with the findings of Nicholls et al. (2008).  12 \nAlthough some researchers or theorists might criticize the use of a heterogeneous 13 \nsample in this study, there is certainly a need to broaden out the study of mental toughness, 14 \ngiven past researcher\u2019s over-emphasis on studying elite performers (cf. Crust, 2008). 15 \nIndeed, while existing research has highlighted the characteristics of elite mentally tough 16 \nathletes, there have been few attempts to establish if such characteristics reliably 17 \ndifferentiate between athletes with high or low levels of mental toughness, or the 18 \nrelationship with non-elite athletes. In essence, much of the existing work is primarily 19 \ndescriptive, and does not allow for a thorough understanding of the concept. 20 \nWhile the findings of the present study suggest mentally tough athletes do not 21 \ncharacteristically experience less intense emotions when compared to less tough athletes, 22 \nfurther research is required to confirm this given a relatively small sample size and a 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 17\nnumber of other limitations. For example, the present research employed self-report 1 \nmeasures that required participants to reflect on typical or general responses. However, it 2 \nremains possible that participant responses could be different when faced with real or 3 \nhypothetical scenarios that demand mental toughness. Future researchers might consider 4 \nassessing the intensity of emotional responses in athletes found to have higher and lower 5 \nlevels of mental toughness using demanding imagined scenarios. Furthermore, given that 6 \nadvances in understanding anxiety responses in sport have been facilitated by investigating 7 \nnot only the intensity of response but also the direction (i.e. facilitative versus debilitative) 8 \nsuch an approach (cf. Hanton, Neil & Mellalieu, 2008) might be employed to further 9 \nunderstand the relationship between mental toughness and affective responses. It may be 10 \nthat direction rather than intensity scores are better able to distinguish between individuals 11 \nwith higher or lower levels of mental toughness.  12 \nThis present research found no significant linear relationships between mental 13 \ntoughness and affect intensity. This finding suggests individuals with high as opposed to 14 \nlow levels of mental toughness do not experience emotions more or less intensely. At 15 \npresent, there is no evidence to suggest the ability of mentally tough athletes to retain 16 \ncontrol in adverse or pressurized situations is due to such athletes having less intense 17 \nemotional experiences. To further understand how mentally tough athletes remain relatively 18 \nunaffected by competition or adversity future researchers should test for differences 19 \nbetween individuals with high and low levels of mental toughness in areas such as focus, 20 \ncognitive processing, decision-making and coping strategies.  21 \n  22 \nReferences 23 \n  Mental Toughness and Affect Intensity \n \n 18\nBull, S., Shambrook, C., James, W., & Brooks, J.
