In the area of enforcement, those challenges are numerous and \nsevere.  Resources are often thinly spread and errant behaviour is difficult to detect.  Regulatory \nobjectives are not always clear and legal powers may be limited.  Enforcement functions are often \ndistributed across numbers of regulators who struggle to co-ordinate their activities.  Further, it is \noften extremely hard to measure the success or failure of regulation. Even if such measurement is \npossible, it may be very difficult to improve the regulatory system by adjusting enforcement \nstrategies and legal powers.  \n \nLet us consider, for instance, the challenges faced in enforcing fisheries laws in order to protect fish \nstocks. Sea fishing is peripatetic and the geographical areas over which a regulator has to monitor \nfishing activities are extensive. Regulatees are highly mobile and there are a large number of \nlanding sites around the coast.  Inspection at sea is very resource intensive, there are many ways to \navoid detection 2  and funding levels allow only a very small proportion of vessels and landings to \nbe inspected.3   The nature of the industry is such that the number of undetected infringements is \n\u2018impossible to determine\u2019.4  Problems of monitoring compliance and enforcement are exacerbated \nby the organisational context.  Monitoring and enforcement involve a number of organisations \nwhose jurisdictions and responsibilities overlap, and often the enforcers have no clear set of \npriorities and outcome objectives to work from.5   As a result, the quota control system relies \nheavily on the self-reporting of catches and there is extensive under-reporting and mis-declaration \nof fish landed.6    \n \n                                                 \n1 Law Department, London School of Economics and Political Science.   We are grateful to all those at the Department \nof Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who cooperated with our research into their enforcement activities in \n2005.  A note on methodology is given below, n.15. \n2 See National Audit Office (NAO), Fisheries Enforcement in England HC 563 Session 2002-3 (April  2003) (hereafter\u2019 \nNAO Report\u2019)   pp.19-20. \n3 See ibid, pp.19-20. \n4 Ibid ,pp.2,15. \n5 Ibid, p.39. The first recommendation of the subsequent report from the Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, Net Benefits \n(March 2004)  (hereafter\u2019Net Benefits\u2019) was that clear hierarchies of fisheries management objectives should be \ndeveloped  (Net Benefits, p. 11). Defra responded with a statement of overarching aim, supported by more detailed \nobjectives \u2013 see Defra, Securing the Benefits (Defra, London, 2005), p. 3.  \n6 See NAO Report, p.16. \n 2 \nLack of clear enforcement objectives and the impossibility of discovering the extent of \u2018off the \nradar\u2019 non-compliance means that it is almost impossible to measure the effectiveness of the \ndetection systems in place, or indeed of the compliance and enforcement processes.  A report by the  \nNational Audit Office on fisheries enforcement in 20037concluded that Defra and the relevant \ninspectorates were unable accurately to judge the need to develop and apply new regulatory \nstrategies for detection, enforcement or assessment.8   The Department, moreover, was found to \noperate inflexibly in its deployment of resources and staff, reducing its capacity to adjust its \ninspection activities.9 \n \nWhat do the current theories on regulatory enforcement have to offer regulators who are faced with \nthese challenges?  We know an increasing amount about how regulated firms themselves respond to \nregulation.10  There are extensive studies on how, once inspectors have arrived on site, they try to \nnegotiate compliance with regulatees, and how they decide what types of enforcement action to take.11  \nThere is also more prescriptive writing on what enforcers should do, ranging from the well known \n\u2018regulatory pyramid\u2019 and \u2018tit for tat\u2019 approach of Ayres and Braithwaite\u2019s responsive regulation, \nthrough the target-analytic approach of responding to the organisation\u2019s reasons for non-compliance,12 \nto the relative new-comer, \u2018risk based regulation\u2019.13   Finally, authors such as Sparrow have prescribed \nextensive systems of performance assessment within regulatory processes, as have central governments. \n14 \n                                                 \n7 See NAO Report. \n8 Ibid p.24. \n9 Ibid p.4 and 35. \n10 C.

Sparrow, The Regulatory Craft (Washington D.C: Brookings, 2003) Chapter 19; UK Government policy \nsince June 2001 has required departments to review the impact of major pieces of regulation within three years of \nimplementation (see: OECD, U.K Challenges at the Cutting Edge ( OECD, Paris,2002) p.34). The Better Regulation \nTask Force (BRTF) recommended the routinisation of post implementation performance reviews in April 2000 (BRTF \nHelping Small Firms Cope with Regulation, London, 2000) and the Better Regulation Executive\u2019s  revised Regulatory \nImpact Assessment  Guidance of 2007 (BRE, London 2007) calls for use of  Post Implementation Reviews to establish \nwhether implemented regulations are having the intended effect and whether they are implementing policy objectives \nefficiently.  \n 3 \n \nBut  such approaches are unlikely to offer complete satisfaction to a regulator who is faced with the sort \nof challenges discussed above.  They say much on how the definition of non-compliance is arrived at \nbut less on how to design inspection strategies, or how to detect non-compliance.  Neither responsive \nregulation nor the target-analytic approach, or even risk based regulation, say  a great deal about how a \nregulator should deal with resource constraints, conflicting institutional pressures, unclear objectives, \nchanges in the regulatory environment, or indeed how particular enforcement strategies might impact \non other aspects of regulatory activity, including information gathering, and how regulators can or \nshould assess the effectiveness of their particular strategies when any of these circumstances obtain. \n \nThis article seeks to address these issues.   It focuses both on how regulators in practice deal with  these \nissues, and seeks to build on existing influential theories to suggest how they should do so.  It proposes \na strategy that constitutes, to coin a phrase, really responsive regulation.  In other words, a strategy \nwhich is even more responsive than \u2018responsive regulation\u2019 \u2013 the highly influential approach developed \nby Ian Ayres and John Braithwaite.\u201915   We argue that to be really responsive, regulators have to be \nresponsive not only to the compliance performance of the regulatee, but in five further ways: to the \nfirms\u2019 own operating and cognitive  frameworks (their \u2018attitudinal settings\u2019); to the broader institutional \nenvironment of the regulatory regime; to the different logics of regulatory tools and strategies; to the \nregime\u2019s own performance; and finally to changes in each of these elements.    \n \nSuch a really responsive approach, we contend further, must be applied right across the range of \nactivities` that make up the regulatory process. In presenting our argument, accordingly, we analyse the \nfull range of tasks involved in regulatory enforcement processes (including detection and assessment) \nand use recent empirical work carried out for the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural \nAffairs (Defra) to illustrate the challenges involved in discharging these various tasks.16   We suggest  \nthat  regulation should be sensitive to the interactions and trade offs that are involved in meetings these \noften quite distinct challenges, and argue that it is only such sensitivity that makes regulation \u2018really \nresponsive\u2019.  \n \n                                                 \n15 I. Ayres and J. Braithwaite, Responsive Regulation (Oxford: OUP, 1992).  \n16 The research was conducted at Defra\u2019s request between August \u2013 November 2005.  It looked at enforcement in seven \nDefra areas: Environmental Impact Assessments (Uncultivated Land); Cattle Identification Scheme; Horticulture \n(classification of imported fruit and vegetables); Pesticides Safety; Waste Management (Fly-Tipping); Fisheries and \nOzone. Its aim was to analyse the use of different enforcement tools and to suggest ways of improving enforcement \neffectiveness by moving towards best practice methods across Defra.  Fifty structured and unstructured interviews were \nconducted with Defra staff across the above seven areas of activity  -  interviewees included  policymakers as well as \nlawyers and field enforcers. The draft findings and proposals  were subjected to feedback  evaluation at Defra review \nmeetings and through presentation at a Defra  interdepartmental workshop. \n 4 \nBefore looking in more detail at the \u2018really responsive regulation\u2019 approach, it is worth setting the scene \nby briefly reviewing the development of mainstream approaches to regulatory enforcement. The next \nsection, accordingly, outlines the ways in which \u2018responsive regulation\u2019 moved the debate (and \npractical strategies) onwards from disputes about \u2018compliance versus deterrence\u2019 approaches. It \nconsiders the advent of \u2018smart\u2019 regulation, the currently fashionable \u2018risk-based\u2019 solution to regulatory \nchallenges, and the contribution of the \u2018problem solving\u2019 method of organising regulatory activities.  \nSuch approaches to regulation bring fresh insights into the regulatory game but they also bring new \nchallenges to the fore. \u2018Smart\u2019 and \u2018risk-based\u2019 strategies, for instance, raise difficulties of \ntransparency, accountability, evaluation and modification that are yet to be fully explored.  \n \nThe second section examines the challenges that remain, in spite of the advances made in these \nliteratures.  It delineates in more detail the key elements of responsiveness that we argue regulation has \nto exhibit in all aspects of regulatory activity.  The third section then examines the particular context of \ninspection and enforcement, analysing the inspection and enforcement process as the interlinkage of \nfive different tasks. Each of these tasks involves a particular set of challenges that is accompanied by its \nown group of potential solutions or approaches. These are discussed individually, and illustrated by \nrecent empirical work in the UK environmental and fisheries sectors. We conclude by summarising the \nvalue that is added by looking at enforcement through a really responsive regulation lens and consider \nthe  potential concern that this may be a level of regulatory analysis that goes too far to be \noperationalised  within realistic resource and time constraints.  \n \n1. The Development of Approaches to Enforcement  \n \nResponsive Regulation \n \nOne of the great contributions of Ayres and Braithwaite\u2019s 1992 book Responsive Regulation was its \ncondemning as \u2018sterile\u2019 the long history of disputation between proponents of \u2018deterrence\u2019 and \n\u2018compliance\u2019 models of regulatory enforcement; \u201cbetween those who think that corporations will \ncomply with the law only when confronted with tough sanctions and those who believe that gentle \npersuasion works in securing business compliance with the law.\u201d17 It was time, they said, to move away \nfrom such \u201ccrude polarisation\u201d and to strike \u201csome sort of sophisticated balance between the two \nsystems.\u201d18  The crucial question for Ayres and Braithwaite was: \u2018When to punish; when to persuade?\u2019 \nTheir prescription was a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 or responsive approach in which regulators enforce in the first \n                                                 \n17 Ibid p.20. See also K. Sparrow, The Regulatory Craft (Washington: Brookings, 2000) p.184.  \n18 Ibid, p.21. \n 5 \ninstance by compliance strategies, but apply more punitive deterrent responses when the regulated firm \nfails to behave as desired. Compliance, they suggested, was more likely when a regulatory agency \ndisplays an explicit enforcement pyramid \u2013 a range of enforcement sanctions extending from \npersuasion, at its base, through warning and civil penalties up to criminal penalties, licence suspensions \nand then licence revocations.19 Regulatory approaches would begin at the bottom of the pyramid and \nescalate in response to compliance failures. There would be a presumption that regulation should \nalways start at the base of the pyramid.  \n \nThe pyramid of sanctions is aimed at the single regulated firm, but Ayres and Braithwaite also apply a \nparallel approach to entire industries. Thus they propose a \u2018pyramid of regulatory strategies\u201920 for \nregulating different areas of social or economic activity.   Governments should seek, and offer, self-\nregulatory solutions to industries in the first instance but that, if appropriate goals are not met, the state \nshould escalate its approach and move on through enforced self regulation to command regulation with \ndiscretionary punishment and finally to command regulation with non-discretionary punishment.  \n \nIt has widely been acknowledged that the enforcement pyramid and the tit-for-tat approach have offered \na considerable advance on blanket commitments to deterrence and compliance models. Responsive \nregulation remains hugely influential worldwide and is applied by a host of governments and regulators. \nIt has been further elaborated both by John Braithwaite and by the recent empirical work on the \nAustralian Tax Office\u2019s Compliance Model led by Valerie Braithwaite.21    Indeed, John Braithwaite has \nexpanded the notion of \u2018responsive regulation\u2019 well beyond its original context of enforcement into an \nall-encompassing regulatory and democractic ideal, incorporating notions of deliberative democracy \nand restorative justice.22  We will return to the more expansive formulations of \u2018responsiveness\u2019 below; \nwe are concerned in this section with the original formulation of responsive regulation, as subsequently \nelaborated in the enforcement context.    As elaborated, responsive regulation has three critical elements \nto its implementation: first, a systematic, fairly directed and fully explained disapproval, combined \nwith, second, a respect for regulatees; and third, an escalation of intensity of regulatory response in the \nabsence of a genuine effort by the regulatee to meet the required standards.23  This latter element, and in \n                                                 \n19 Ibid, p.35 . On different ways of acting responsively see V.L. Nielsen, \u2018Are Regulators Responsive?\u2019(2006)28 Law \nand Policy 295. \n20 Ibid pp.38-9. \n21 J. Braithwaite, Responsive Regulation and Restorative Justice (OUP, 2002); V. Braithwaite (ed), Special Issue on \nResponsive Regulation and Taxation (2007) 29(1) Law and Policy. \n22 Braithwaite op. cit (2002); J. Braithwaite, \u2018Responsive Regulation and Developing Economies\u2019 (2006) 34 (5) World \nDevelopment 884. \n23 Braithwaite op. cit (2002). \n 6 \nparticular the pyramidic regulatory strategy of enforcement, has however been the subject of a number \nof criticisms or reservations.24                  \n \nThese criticisms fall mainly into three groups: the policy or conceptual; the practical, and the \nprincipled.  In policy terms, the first criticism of the pyramid approach is that in some circumstances \nstep by step escalation up the pyramid may not be appropriate.  For example, where potentially \ncatastrophic risks are being controlled it may not be feasible to enforce by escalating up the layers of \nthe pyramid and the appropriate reaction may be immediate resort to the higher levels. 25    \n \nSecondly, the regulator is meant to move up and down the pyramid depending on whether the regulatee \ncooperates or not.  Escalation and descalation is thus possible throughout the course of the relationship \nwith a firm, and indeed possibly within the same regulatory encounter.  But moving down the pyramid, \nmay not always be easy, as Ayres and Braithwaite recognise, because use of more punitive sanctions \ncan prejudice the relationships between regulators and regulates that are the foundations for the less \npunitive strategies.26  Moreover, the constant threat of more punitive sanctions at the top can make \n\u2018voluntary\u2019 compliance at the bottom of the pyramid impossible. \n \nThirdly, it may be wasteful to operate an escalating tit for tat strategy across the board.  Responsive \nregulation presupposes that regulatees do in fact respond to the pressures imposed by regulators  \nthrough the sanctioning pyramid.  However corporate behaviour is often driven not by regulatory \npressure but the culture prevailing in the sector or by the far more pressing forces of competition.   \nSome authors have specified this more closely in terms of the motivations or character of non-\ncompliance.27  These approaches (which we term \u2018target-analytic\u2019) suggest that in some situations it \n                                                 \n24 For critiques of responsive regulation see e.g. N. Gunningham and P. Grabosky, Smart Regulation (Oxford: \nClarendon Press, 1998); J. Mendeloff, \u2019Overcoming Barriers to Better Regulation\u2019 (1993) 18 Law and Social Inquiry \n711-29; R. Johnstone, \u2018Putting the Regulated Back into Regulation\u2019 (1999) 26 J. of Law and Society 378-390; and the \nbook reviews of Responsive Regulation  at: (1993) 106  Harvard Law Review 1685-1690 (Editorial); (1993) 98 \nAmerican Journal of Sociology 1187-89 (Anne Khademian); (1993) 87 American Political Science Review 782-3 (John \nScholz); (1993) 22 Contemporary Sociology 338-9 (Joel Rogers). \n25 Though see the argument that, where possible, persuasion should be the strategy of first choice because preserving \nthe perception of fairness is important to nurturing voluntary compliance \u2013 discussed  by K Murphy, \u2018Moving Towards \na More Effective  Model of Regulatory Enforcement in the Australian Tax Office\u2019 (2004) British Tax Review 603-19. \n26 See Ayres and Braithwaite, op cit Chapter 2; F. Haines, Corporate Regulation: Beyond Punish or Persuade                   \n( Oxford,1997) p.219; Johnstone, loc. cit. \n27 For example, Kagan and Scholz point to three types of firm \u2013 R. Kagan and J. Scholz, \u2019 The Criminology of the \nCorporation\u2019 in K. Hawkins  and J. Thomas (eds.) Enforcing Regulation (Boston, Kluwer, 1984).  Empirical work has \nquestioned the validity of the distinctiveness of these reasons for non-compliance, however: V. Braithwaite, J. \nBraithwaite, D. Gibson and T. Makkai, \u2018Regulatory Styles, Motivational Postures and Nursing Home Compliance\u2019 \n(1994) 16 Law and Policy 363; see also V. Braithwaite (ed), Taxing Democracy: Understanding Tax Avoidance and \nEvasion (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003).  For other classifications see eg R. Baldwin, \u2018Why Rules Don\u2019t Work\u2019 (1990) 53 \nMLR 321.  The UK tax regulator, HM Customs and Excise, has come up with a further classification, identifying seven \ntypes of responses on a compliance continuum, and the appropriate regulatory strategy in each case: HM Customs and \nExcise Annual Report 2003-4, HC 119 (London: HMSO, 2003), p.123.    \n 7 \nmay be more efficient to analyse types of regulated firms and to tailor and target types of regulatory \nresponse accordingly. If, for example, research reveals that a particular problem is predominately being \ncaused by firms that are ill-disposed to respond to advice; education and persuasion, the optimal \nregulatory response will not be to start at the base of the enforcement pyramid \u2013 it will demand early \nintervention at a higher level. Whenever a group of regulatees is irrational or unresponsive to tit for tat \napproaches, the latter will tend to prove wasteful of resources. Similarly, an analysis of risk levels may \nmilitate in favour of early resort to higher levels of intervention (even where risks are non-catastrophic). \nThe thrust of this argument is that, at least where the costs of analysis are low, it will be more efficient \nto \u2018target\u2019 responses than to proceed generally on a responsive regulation basis.    \n \nThe pyramid approach and target-analytic approach can be integrated, but only with some modification \nof the former.   Indeed in a move which breaks fundamentally with the game-theory roots of the \u2018tit for \ntat\u2019 strategy and its underlying assumption of a rational actor, Braithwaite has subsequently recognised \ndifferent types of motivational postures suggested different strategies are appropriate for different types \nof firm.  The starting point should still be negotiation.  However, escalation should depend on an \nassessment of the firm\u2019s motivational stance and regulatory capacity.  \u2018Virtuous\u2019 firms should receive \nnegotiating, restorative justice strategies; \u2018rational\u2019 firms should be met with deterrence strategies, and \nincompetent and irrational actors should be simply incapacitated, eg have their licences revoked.28   \n \nFourthly, responsive regulation approaches look most convincing when a binary regulator-regulatee \nrelationship is assumed.29  Such a scenario envisages the transmission of clear messages from regulator \nto regulatee.  As Parker has suggested, it involves the creation \u2018enforcement communities\u2019 in which \nregulator and regulatee understand the strategy that each is adopting and can predict each other\u2019s \nresponses.30   Such understanding may not develop, however, even in a binary relationship.   The \nrelationship between the regulatee and the rest of the regulatory regime may not consist only of a \nrelationship with one regulator in any particular area of activity.  Regulatory regimes can be highly \ncomplex, and inspection and enforcement activities can be spread across different regulators with \nrespect to similar activities or regulations.  For example, our 2005 study of Defra\u2019s inspection and \nenforcement revealed that there were  numerous areas in which enforcement responsibilities are spread \nacross different regulators, including fly-tipping (Defra, Local Authorities, police); cattle identification    \n                                                 \n28 On combining targeting and responsive approaches see Braithwaite, op.cit (2002), pp.36-40, reiterated in J. \nBraithwaite, \u2018Rewards and Regulation\u2019 (2002) Jnl Law and Society 12 at 21-22 and J. Braithwaite, \u2018Responsive \nRegulation and Developing Economies\u2019 (2006) 34(5) World Development 885 at 887-8.  \n29 Responsive regulation, in Ayres and Braithwaite\u2019s original formulation, does also envisage the involvement of \nconsumers in a tri-partite arrangement; however the assumption is that the relationship is otherwise between a firm and \na regulator and does not envisage multiple regulators. \n30 C. Parker, \u2018Compliance professionalism and regulatory community: The Australian trade practices regime\u2019 (1999) \n26(2) Journal of Law & Society 215-239. \n 8 \n(State Veterinary Service (SVS), Rural Payments Agency, Local Authorities); Transmissible \nSpongiform Encephalopathy Regulations (SVS, Local Authorities, Defra, Food Standards Agency).  As \na result, responsive regulation may prove weak because the messages flowing between regulators and \nregulatees are confused or subject to interference.  This may happen because regulatees are uncertain \nabout who is demanding what and which regulator needs to be listened to regarding a particular issue.  \nSuch regulatory \u2018white noise\u2019 may undermine the responsive regulation strategy because lack of clear \nmessaging will detract from the impact of any responsive approach to sanctioning. \n \nTurning to the practical limitations of the  pyramid approach, an issue in some industries is that there \nmight be insufficient repeat interactions between regulator and regulated to allow a pyramidal strategy \nto be operated.31  Where such interactions do occur, escalating through the layers of the pyramid may \nsimply not happen  because enforcement is not simply a two-actor game in which the only factor that \nshapes the enforcer\u2019s response is the co-operative or unco-operativeness of the regulatee.   Indeed, as \nMendeloff has argued, whether a responsive approach is optimal will depend on a number of other \nfactors such as agency resource levels, the size of the regulated population, the kinds of standards \nimposed (and how these are received), the observability of non-compliance, the costs of compliance, \nthe financial assistance available for compliance  and the penalty structure.32  Enforcers may prove \nexcessively tied to compliance approaches for a number of reasons, including their own organisational \nresources, culture and practices and the constraints of the broader institutional environment.   The \nagency may lack the tools or resources to progress to more punitive strategies; it may fear the political \nconsequences of progression and may not have the judicial33, public or political support for escalation; \nit may be reluctant to trigger an adverse business reaction to deterrence strategies; it may find it difficult \nto assess the need for escalation because it lacks the necessary information on the exact nature of a \nregulated firm\u2019s response to existing controls; and it may be disinclined to escalate unless it has \nsufficient evidence to make a case for the highest level of response (e.g. to prosecute or disqualify).34  \nAlternatively, those at the top of the regulatory organisation may have made a strategic decision to \n\u2018come down hard\u2019 on particular types of offence or offender for a range of reasons \u2013 media or political \npressure, for example, or as a more general shift to a more deterrence\u2019 or punitive style across the board \n                                                 \n31 See N. Gunningham and R Johnstone, Regulating Workplace Safety  Oxford, OUP, 1999, pp. 123-129. \n32 See Mendeloff, op.cit., p. 717. \n33 On under-deterrence from low fines see e.g. the complaints of the Environment Agency in Annual Report 2004, and \nthe comments in the Hampton and Macrory Reports: P. Hampton, Reducing Administrative Burdens (London, HM \nTreasury, 2005) (hereafter Hampton Report); and R. Macrory, Regulatory Justice: Sanctioning in a post-Hampton \nWorld ( Cabinet Office, May 2006) (hereafter Macrory Report); and  NAO Report, paras. 2.34-2.36. \n34 The NAO Report, para. 2.27 stated that fisheries infringements would be dealt with by means of written warnings in \nsome cases but only if \u2018 the same evidence would be likely to stand scrutiny successfully if it were presented to a court\u2019. \n 9 \nor with respect to particular regulatees,35 or to compensate for weaknesses in other inspection and \nenforcement strategies adopted by the regulator.  Such enforcement strategies are being adopted by UK \nregulators, for example the Financial Services Authority, to complement their risk based approaches to \ninspection and supervision.  In this situation, regulatory policy overrides the individual nature of the \nregulator-regulatee relationship.  It does not matter how cooperative the regulatee is, the regulatory \nofficial is meant to adopt a more punitive stance in order to pursue wider organisational objectives.   \n \nThere may also be legal problems in applying a responsive approach.36 In some areas, legislatures may \nhave decreed that defaulters shall be met with, say, deterrence strategies and this may tie the hands of \nthe enforcing agency.37 Responsive regulation, moreover, calls for the availability of a wide range of \ncredible sanctions, but legislators may have failed to provide regulators with the sanctions and \ninvestigative tools that allow a progression up the pyramid. The recent Macrory review of penalties, for \nexample, highlighted many areas where regulators possessed no big stick that allowed them to \u2018speak \nsoftly\u2019 whilst having a credible threat in the background.38   Although regulators commonly possess \nprosecution powers, the fines imposed by the courts are often so low that they fail to provide deterrence \nto the more calculating offenders, particularly small, itinerant operators who have few reputational \nconcerns.39  Alternatively, the stick may be so big (involving, for instance, the revocation of a major \nutility\u2019s licence, or the de-recognition of a political party) that it simply can never be used.  The \npotential sanction may be so severe that even threats to use it are not credible. \n \nAs for \u2018principled\u2019 concerns, responsive regulatory strategies have also been criticised on the grounds \nof fairness, proportionality and consistency.  Although responsive strategies can uphold principles of \nsubstantive rationality, they inevitably come up against criticisms of lack of formalism and as \nundermining both the rule of law and broader constitutional values.40  Yeung, for example, argues that \nthe \u2018relentless quest for effective compliance\u2019 that pervades Ayres and Braithwaite\u2019s model prioritises \nthe functional concerns of ensuring effective regulation over constitutional values of proportionality and \nconsistency.  Regulatory responses are dictated by the cooperation or non-cooperation of the regulatee, \nnot the seriousness of the infraction.  Infractions causing widespread harm will not be treated severely \nso long as the regulatee cooperates with the regulator, whereas minor infractions will be treated \n                                                 \n35 Eg J.

The enforcement response is thus not proportional to the \nharm cause, and this is said to raise issues of consistency of treatment across different regulatees.41 Such \nissues can be addressed to an extent by the generation of rules and guidelines to confine, structure and \ncheck responsive strategies, but there are dangers that such structuring may straitjacket responsive \nregulation within costly bureaucratic controls and that the structuring guidelines used may give effect to \nimportant policies that are likely to be under-exposed to democratic scrutiny.42  Further, such \n\u2018collaborative compliance\u2019 regimes, characterised by close relationships between regulator and regulate, \nare prone to \u2018regulatory capture\u2019.43   Ayres and Braithwaite\u2019s answer here is to advocate a system of  \ntripartism \u2013 in which Public Interest Groups (PIGs) are legally empowered  parties within the regulatory \nprocess  that can act as informed  representatives of regulatory beneficiaries and operate  as \ncounterbalances to industrial and agency pressures.44 Critics have, however, questioned how such a \nsystem can be made to work within responsive regulation and have cautioned that empowered PIGs \nmay become \u2018shadow regulators\u2019;45 that disputes about the representativeness of empowered PIGs can \nbe expected; that gridlocks may result; and that regulatory processes will not be constructively \nunderpinned by trust and cooperation where there is (as in the USA) a backdrop of adversarial \nlegalism.46 \n \n \nResponding to the Limitations of Responsive Regulation \u2013 Smart Regulation \n \nResponsive regulation does not provide a complete answer to the problems of designing tools for \nregulation or of applying tools in different combinations, nor was it intended to.  As Gunningham, \nGrabosky and Sinclair noted in their \u2018smart\u2019 regulatory pyramid,47 there may be arguments for not \nconfining the regulatory response to escalating punitive responses but for thinking laterally and \nbreaking away from the punitive pyramid \u2013 for instance by placing more emphasis on ex ante controls \nsuch as screening, considering whether a restructuring of the industry will produce desired results better \nthan  regulation or whether resort  to non-state controls will work better than state sanctioning or \nwhether it is necessary to look beyond individual non- compliers to systemic difficulties in the sector.48  \n                                                 \n41 K.

Gunningham and P. Grabosky, Smart Regulation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), chapter 6; see also Ayres \nand Braithwaite, loc. cit., pp.38-9. \n48 See Johnstone, loc. cit. 383. \n 11 \nThe smart regulatory pyramid is also three-sided in  making the point that  different sorts of controls  \ncan be imposed by the state but also by quasi-regulators ( such as trade associations and professions) \nand  by corporations. Gunningham and Sinclair argue: \u201cour pyramid conceives of the possibility of \nregulation using a number of different instruments implemented by a number of parties.  It conceives of \nescalation to higher levels of coerciveness not only within a single instrument but also across several \ninstruments.\u201d49   \n \nThe posited advantages of smart regulation\u2019s three-sided pyramid are that it paves the way to a \ncoordinated approach to regulation in which it is possible to escalate responses to non-compliance by \nmoving not only up a single face of the pyramid but also  from one face of the pyramid to another (e.g. \nfrom a state control to a corporate control or industry association instrument). This gives flexibility of \nresponse and allows sanctioning gaps to be filled \u2013 so that if escalation up the state system is not \npossible (e.g. because a legal penalty is not provided or is inadequate) resort can be made to another \nform of influence.50 Seeing regulation in terms of these three dimensions allows creative mixes, or \nnetworks, of regulatory enforcement instruments and of influencing actors or institutions to be adopted. \nIt also encompasses the use of control instruments that, in certain contexts, may be easier to apply, less \ncostly and more influential than state controls.  \n \nSmart regulation is, accordingly more holistic than responsive regulation in its basic, enforcement, \nform.51 It nevertheless involves an escalation process and, as a result, runs up against many of the \ngeneral difficulties that responsive regulation encounters and which were noted above.  In addition, of \ncourse, the creation of regulatory networks and the processes of coordinating responses across three \ndifferent systems, or faces of the pyramid, involves its own problems (an important contribution of \n\u2018smart regulation\u2019 is its discussion of inherent complementarities and incompatibilities between \ndifferent regulatory instruments).52  As the advocates of this approach acknowledge,53 such coordination \nis not always easy and gives rise to special difficulties of information management, resource and time \nconstraints and political differences between different institutional actors.

Braithwaite has expanded again on his own original model in a similar vein to argue that a \nresponsive approach to developing and using regulatory tools which conceives non-state actors as important regulators \nin their own right can enhance the regulatory capacity of the state - see Braithwaite, loc.cit (2006). On strategies for \nenhancing capacity by enrolling other actors see also J. Braithwaite and P. Drahos, Global Business Regulation \n(Oxford: OUP, 2001) and J. Black, \u2018Enrolling Actors in Regulatory Processes: Examples from UK Financial Services \nRegulation\u2019 [2003] Public Law 62-90. \n50 Ibid, p.403. \n51 The architects of responsive regulation might argue, however, that there is no inconsistency between the responsive \nand the smart  approaches. John Braithwaite, indeed (in \u2018Responsive Regulation and Developing Economies\u2019(2006)34 \nWorld Development 884,888) has emphasised that responsive regulation conceives of NGOs  and businesses as \nimportant regulators in their own right so that :\u2019..the weaknesses of a state regulator may be compensated by the \nstrengths of NGOs or business regulators\u2019(p.892). \n52 Gunningham and Grabosky, op.cit chapter 6 (by Gunningham and Sinclair).  \n53 Ibid pp.402-4. \n 12 \nescalatory response presents challenges within the responsive regulation pyramid but such evaluations \nwill be all the more difficult when complex mixes of strategy and institutions are involved. Concerns \nabout consistency, fairness and accountability may, moreover, be even more acute than was the case \nwith responsive regulation.54  \n \nRisk Based Regulation \n \nAs a leading influence at the central governmental level, responsive regulation has perhaps given way \n(at least in the UK) to the currently fashionable \u2018risk- based\u2019 regulation. In the U.K in March 2005 the \nHampton Review55 recommended that all regulatory agencies should adopt a risk- based approach to \nenforcement and a host of agencies are actively developing such systems.56 The principal sense in \nwhich the term \u2018risk based\u2019 regulation is used post Hampton is to refer to a targeting of inspection and \nenforcement resources that is based on an assessment of the  risks that a regulated person or firm poses \nto the regulator\u2019s objectives. The key components of the approach are evaluations of the risk of non-\ncompliance and calculations regarding the impact that the non-compliance will have on the regulatory \nbody\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. Risk- based regulation thus offers an evidence-based means of \ntargeting the use of resources. It differs from \u2018pyramidic\u2019 approaches by emphasising analysis and \ntargeting rather than a process of responsive escalation. As such, risk- based approaches are associated \nwith a number of particular strengths. They provide a systematic framework that allows regulators to \nrelate their enforcement activities to the achievement of objectives. They enable resources to be \ntargeted in a manner that prioritises highest risks, and they provide a basis for evaluating new \nregulatory challenges and new risks.  \n \nThe debate on risk based regulation is focused primarily on inspection.  It is meant to apply to both \nproactive and reactive enforcement strategies.  The enforcement activities of some regulators, notably \nutilities regulators, are principally reactive: triggered by complaints or reported incidents. The \nadvantage of enforcing reactively is that private citizens often bear the burden of detection work, and \nthis reduces public budgetary needs. Another is that the regulator is seen to be responsive to public \nconcerns.   Core disadvantages are that the drivers of action may be short term random and irrational \nconsiderations; attention is not necessarily paid to the most important risks; and preventative control is \nnot established.   Many regulators operate a proactive inspection strategy.  The idea of risk based \nregulation is to target both proactive and reactive strategies in accordance with the risks a firm poses to \n                                                 \n54 See Braithwaite, loc. cit. \n55 Hampton Report. \n56 J. Black, \u2018The Emergence of Risk Based Regulation and the New Public Risk Management in the UK\u2019 (2005) Public \nLaw 512-548; on the development of similar system by the Australian Tax Office see J. Braithwaite, \u2018Meta-Risk \nManagement and Responsive Regulation for Tax System Integrity\u2019 (2003) 25 (1) Law and Policy 1. \n 13 \nthe regulators\u2019 objectives.  As such it stands in contrast to routine, random or regional approaches to \ninspections.  Thus in the area of VAT, inspectors used routinely to visit premises, regardless of whether \nthere had been any incidence of non-compliance in the past, or regardless of size and so on.  Under the \nnew risk based system, firms are risk-rated in accordance with their propensity for, and impact of, non-\ncompliance.57 \n \nRisk- based approaches, however, give rise to a number of particular challenges and difficulties.58  Risk \nbased regulation means focusing resources on regulatory priorities; the flip side is that it means not \ndoing things that were done before.  In the first instance, therefore, risk based systems require that \nsenior regulatory managers are clear about which risks will not be prioritised.   These decisions may \nwell have been made by the regulator previously: resource and other limitations on regulatory capacity \nmean that regulators have always had to prioritise.  Such decisions have previously been implicit and \nnon-transparent.  Risk based systems require them to be made explicit.  As a result, managers must be \nable and prepared to deal with the political and practical consequences of establishing particular levels \nof risk tolerance. They must be willing to justify such levels of tolerance both politically and legally. \nThe targeting approach of risk -based systems may thus detract from the reassurance that the public \nderives from across the board mechanisms \u2013 from having a regulatory \u2018bobby on the beat.\u2019   Risk based \nsystems also raise issues of consistency of treatment of regulated firms, and equality of protection of \nconsumers and the public.  For these and other reasons, politicians and the public may not support the \nregulatory body\u2019s decisions regarding the risks that it will prioritise for attention and those that it will \nnot. \n \nRisk  based systems, moreover, tend to focus on known and familiar risks.  They can fail to pick up new \ndeveloping risks and will tend to be backward looking and \u2018locked in\u2019 to an established analytic \nframework.   Another problem may be that risk -based systems will tend to neglect lower levels of risk, \nwhich if numerous and spread broadly, may involve considerable cumulative dangers.  Poorly designed \nrisk-based approaches, indeed, are likely to lead to persistent non-enforcement  regarding   certain types \nof firm and systemic risks. If such systems are not supplemented by other programmes, such as those of \nrandom inspection (as Hampton advocated) they can under-deter the lower level risk creators, the \n\u2018forgotten offenders\u2019 who escape prioritisation.  The overall effect of regulation is then not to reduce \nrisk, but to substitute widely spread risks for lower numbers of larger risks.    \n \n                                                 \n57 See HM Customs and Excise Annual Report 2003-4, HC 119 (London: HMSO, 2003), pp. 123-134 for the initial \noutline of this strategy, part of the broader VAT Compliance Strategy. \n58 See e.g Black, op. cit (2005) and (2006). \n 14 \nA more general problem with risk-based regulation is that it tends to focus on the individual firm, not \non the more strategic issue of how to raise compliance within the regulatory community as a whole. \nRisk-based regulation, moreover, may even prove unduly narrow in its approach to even individual \nfirms. It may tend to tailor not merely the targeting but also the severity of its sanctioning approach \naccording to the level of risk presented by the non-complier.59 Such a strategy may, however, under \nemphasise the need  to understand why such a non-complier is not behaving as required and to identify \nthe best regulatory response to that non-compliance.  \n \nIn addition, risk- based regimes build their analyses by assessing on accumulated supplies of \ninformation.  They may, accordingly, impose significant burdens on businesses (especially if poorly \nmanaged) and this may cut across government desires to reduce burdens and form-filling.   They also \nrequire significant resources on the part of regulators to be able to analyse and respond to risks, and \nresources may not shift within regulatory organisations in a way which responds to changes in risk.60  \nNor can it be assumed that risk-based regulation always constitutes an efficient use of resources. If a \nregulatory body prioritises its deployment of resources by targeting these at highest risks this may prove \ncostly where the expense of reducing those risks is high because enforcement or compliance cost are \nextensive. The efficient way to use a given level of resources to reduce overall risks (for instance to the \nenvironment) is to target not the highest risks or risk creators but those activities or risk creators  that \noffer the prospects of the highest risk reductions for the given expenditure of resources. A strategy of \ntargeting highest risks and \u2018most severe\u2019 problems would often fail a cost-benefit comparison with other \nstrategies.  \n \nFinally, as with pyramidic approaches, risk-based systems may give risk to considerable issues of \naccountability. Even those regulatory agencies that recognise the virtues of openness, transparency and \naccountability may tend to assume that their processes for establishing and applying risk measures and \ncriteria, and for selecting actionable risks, are uncontentious and technical.  In response, it can be \nargued that a major effect of risk- based regulation is to transfer the real locus of policymaking into the \nrecesses of these very processes. The danger is that risk-based regulation will tend to bury \npolicymaking issues deep within the administrative process, making scrutiny and accountability \nextremely difficult.61 \n \n                                                 \n59 Black, loc. cit. (2006). \n60 For example, NAO, The Financial Services Authority: A Review under s.12 of the Financial Services and Markets \nAct 2000 (London, April 2007), paras 1.10-1.15. \n61 See Black, loc.cit. \n 15 \nCan it be argued, however, that Malcolm Sparrow\u2019s \u2018regulatory craft\u2019 approach deals with the above \ndifficulties? This strategy places one version of risk-based regulation \u2013 namely problem solving -  at  \nthe centre of regulatory strategy. It separates out the \u2018stages of problem solving\u201962 and stresses the need \nto define problems precisely, to monitor and measure performance and to adjust strategy on the basis of \nperformance assessments. It also accepts the \u201cdynamic nature of the risk control game.\u201d63 What it does \nnot do is paint a picture of the strategic choices that confront regulators in attempting to carry out \ndifferent tasks or \u2018stages\u2019 of the problem solving process. Sparrow tells us to target key problems and \nsolve these by developing solutions or interventions and \u2018implementing the plan\u2019 \u2013 what we are not told \nis whether the solution to a given problem lies through \u2018responsive\u2019 \u2018deterrent\u2019 or some other \napproach.64 We have no menu of options nor are we offered an explanation of the potential interactions \nbetween different regulatory logics and different strategies for coming to grips with the stages of the \nproblem solving process \u2013 matters that are more fully dealt with by proponents of smart regulation. The \n\u2018problem-centred\u2019 approach, moreover, assumes, perhaps too readily, that regulation can be parcelled \ninto problems and projects to be addressed by project teams.65 This may well be the case in some \nscenarios \u2013 where, for instance, a particular pollution problem occurs for a narrow and identifiable set \nof reasons. In other situations, however, the regulator may be faced with a host of different kinds of \nerrant behaviour that cumulatively cause a mischief. To focus on the mischief by defining it as \u2018the \nproblem\u2019 may not help us a great deal in seeking to devise strategies for responding to it. What may be \nmore useful is to identify the challenges that have to be faced, the available options (in terms of tools \nand strategies) and the kind of process that will foster working towards an optimal application of tools \nand strategies over time. \n \nTo summarise, the responsive, smart, risk-based  and \u2018 regulatory craft\u2019 approaches all contribute very \nsignificantly to regulatory understandings, but even leaving aside the difficulties discussed above, they \ncan be said to leave a residual need for further engagement with the  considerable body of challenges \nthat  regulators face in their actions of  detecting, constructing and responding to non-compliance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n62 Sparrow, op.cit., Chapter 10.  \n63 Ibid, p.274. \n64 See Gunningham and Grabosky, op.cit., Chapter 6.  \n65 Sparrow (p.232) concedes that the problem solving approach \u201cis predicted on the way hypothesis that a significant \nproportional of day to day accidents, incidents, violations and crimes fall into patterns that can be discerned.\u201d  \n 16 \n2. Remaining Challenges  and  Really Responsive Regulation \n \nThe notion of \u2018responsiveness\u2019 has been used in debates on  law and regulation in a number of ways.66  \nHere we draw on the criticisms of the enforcement strategies noted above,  as well as a range of existing \nliterature in regulatory and organisational theory ( and notably on  Selznick\u2019s formulation of \nresponsiveness67)  to argue that to be \u2018really responsive\u2019, regulators have to respond not merely to firms\u2019 \ncompliance responses but also to their attitudinal settings; to the broader institutional environment of \nthe regulatory regime; to the different logics of regulatory tools and strategies; to the regime\u2019s own \nperformance; and finally to changes in each of these elements. Our argument is developed in the \nenforcement context but it is applicable to  all aspects of regulatory activity \u2013 this follows from our \nview that the really responsive regulator should  be wedded neither to any particular strategy of \nenforcement nor to enforcement  as the control method of first choice. \n \nAt this point it is worth briefly elaborating on each of the elements just referred to.  \n \nResponsiveness to Regulatees\u2019 Attitudinal Settings \n \nIn a really responsive regulatory regime, responsiveness means responding to the operating and \ncognitive framework of the particular firm or, put in other terms, its own \u2018attitudinal setting\u2019.  This goes \nbeyond the question of how the firm, or different individuals within the firm, interact on a personal \nlevel and whether relationships are cooperative or antagonistic to look at the broader context that shapes \nthe firm\u2019s response to the regulatory regime.   Recent work on compliance shows the importance of \nmotivational postures, the social signals that individuals send to the regulator and to themselves to \ncommunicate the degree they accept the regulatory agenda and the way in which the regulator functions \nand carries out its duties on a daily basis.   This work identifies five types of motivational posture: \ncommitment to or accommodation of the regulatory agenda; capitulation to the regulatory authority; \n                                                 \n66 See John Braithwaite\u2019s  own expansion of the concept so that responsive regulation has now broken free of its \nenforcement roots to encompass far broader notions of deliberative democracy and restorative justice, and to provide a \ntools-based framework for enhancing the regulatory capacity of the state or providing an alternative to it -  in \nBraithwaite, op.cit (2006) and see also P. Selznick, The Moral Commonwealth (Berkely: UCLA Press, 1992), pp. 463-\n75; P. Nonet and P. Selznick, Law and Society in Transition: Toward Responsive Law (New York: Harper \/ Colophon, \n1978).  Teubner\u2019s notion of \u2018reflexiveness\u2019 initially drew on Selznick\u2019s responsiveness, but developed in a theoretically \ndistinct direction: G. Teubner, \u2018After Legal Instrumentalism: Strategic Models of Post-Regulatory Law\u2019 in G. Teubner \n(ed), Dilemmas of Law in the Welfare State (Berlin, 1986); G. Teubner, \u2018Substantive and Reflexive Elements in Modern \nLaw\u2019 (1983) 17 Law & Soc Rev 239; id., \u2018Juridification - Concepts, Aspects, Limits, Solutions\u2019 in G. Teubner (ed), \nJuridification of the Social Spheres (Berlin, 1987).  Responsiveness has also been elaborated by others, see eg V.L. \nNielsen, \u2018Are Regulators Responsive?\u2019 (2006) 28(3) Law and Policy 395. \n67  Selznick has been a long proponent of \u2018responsive\u2019 law, and in turn, regulation \u2013 see Selzcick at  note 71 above. \n 17 \nresistance, game playing and disengagement. 68   In its policy prescription, which is further refinement \nof the original pyramid, this work retains a focus on the nature of the firm-regulator relationship, and \nlooks to that relationship to change motivational postures, for example through improving the \nprocedural fairness in the administration of the regime, or examining how threats or rewards affect \nmotivational postures.69  It is suggested that we need to go beyond the confines of this relationship to \nexamine broader factors.  Work in the institutional theory of organisations which focuses on how \norganisations respond to their environment emphasise that responses are a complex combination of \nrational and institutionalised responses, in which strategic action is structured by a combination of \ninternal and external institutional pressures, including pursuit of profitability or reputation, market \nposition, congruence of external regulatory demands and internal goals, the means by which regulatory \nnorms are imposed, the perceived fairness of the regulatory regime and the nature of the external \nenvironment.70     \n \nReally responsive regulation thus demands that regulators take account of the cultures and \nunderstandings that operate within regulated organisations.  A really responsive regulation \napproach, moreover, draws attention to the kinds of problem that arise when there are tensions \nbetween attitudinal settings. It also highlights the effects of such tensions across the different tasks \nthat are involved in the regulatory enforcement process \u2013 a matter to be returned to in Section 3 \nbelow.  \n \nResponsiveness to Institutional Environments \n \nThe second element of really responsive regulation is that is recognises and responds to the constraints \nand opportunities that are presented by the institutional environments within which the relevant \nregulators act.   In short, this is a plea for institutional theories to be taken more seriously by regulatory \nscholars.  There are different versions of institutionalism, which are distinguished by the model of \nstance they take on the extent to which structure or agency determines behaviour.71  All agree, however,  \n                                                 \n68 A similar categorisation has been developed in institutional theory: Oliver identifies five response strategies: \nacquiescence, compromise, manipulation, avoidance or defiance: C. Oliver, \u2018Strategic Responses to Institutional Processes\u2019 \n(1991) 16(1) Academy of Management Review 145; or see eg HM Customs and Excise categorisation, op.cit.. \n69 V. Braithwaite loc.cit. (2007).  On the importance of perceptions of fairness of the regulatory regime for compliance \nsee L. Feld and B. Frey, \u2018Tax Compliance as the Result of a Psychological Tax Contract: The Role of Incentives and \nResponsive Regulation\u2019 (2007) 29(1) Law and Policy 102; E. Ahmed and V.

This notion of institutional environment is akin to Haines\u2019s idea of \u2018regulatory character\u2019,73 but \nthe delineation of the exact nature and  role of the institutional environment in shaping individual and \norganisational decisions has also long been the concern of institutionalists in sociology, political science \nand international relations.74   Really responsive regulation emphasises the relevance of the institutional \ncontext not only of the regulatee, but of the regulator, in shaping the regulators\u2019 enforcement activities. \n \nResponsiveness to the Logics of Different Regulatory Tools and Strategies \n \nThe third element in really responsive regulation is responsiveness to the logics of different regulatory \nstrategies and tools.75  Different regulatory strategies can have different logics. They embody, or at the \nleast place emphasis on, different understandings of the nature of behaviour or of an institutional \nenvironment, and in turn have different preconditions for effectiveness (which are that the institutional \nenvironment or behaviour conforms to those foundational understandings)76.   The concept of \n\u2018regulatory logic\u2019, it should be noted, differs from the idea of regulatory objectives (such as cleaner \nenvironments or safer workplaces). Such objectives, may be sought to be achieved through different \nlogics (e.g. of punishment or restoration or rehabilitation or through \u2019professional\u2019 or \u2018commercial\u2019 \n                                                                                                                                                                  \nStudies 936-957; J.

Such logics involve distinctive relationships and modes of conversing with regulated parties \u2013 \na punitive message, for instance, will be framed and received differently from a rehabilitative message. \nCoherence of logic matters because confusion detracts from effective regulation.77   Really responsive \nregulation, moreover, seeks to identify the regulatory logics engaged in different regulatory tasks.  \nRegulators cannot combine, say, punitive, rehabilitative and restorative regulatory logics across \ndifferent enforcement tasks (such as detection and response development, discussed below) without this \ngiving rise to potential tensions \u2013 which usually involve institutional or communications difficulties. \nInstitutional problems arise when different regulatory bodies play different and non-harmonious roles \nwithin a regime.  Communications problems are caused when different logics are based on different \nassumptions, value systems, cultures and founding ideas so that messaging across logics involves \ndistortions and failures of contact.  Responsive regulation requires escalation up a punitive scale that \ncrosses logics; smart regulation theory encounters such issues in a more complex framework (and to a \ndegree addresses complementarities and inconsistencies of approach) and risk based regulation focuses \non the identification of priorities and targets rather than the potential difficulties of combining \nregulatory logics.  In drawing closer attention to the nature of different regulatory technologies and their \ninherent logics, really responsive regulation seeks to provide a way of coming to grips with these \ntensions within a conceptual framework that identifies potential difficulties and provides a foundation \nfor their resolution.   \n \n \nResponsiveness to the Regime\u2019s own Performance and Effects \n \nFourthly, really responsive regulation has to be responsive to the regime\u2019s own performance.  We are \nnot alone in emphasising the need for performance evaluation and modification.  One important \nelement of Selznick\u2019s conceptualisation of responsive law (and by extension, regulation) is that law \nbecomes an instrument of inquiry into both its implementation and the premises on which the law, is \nbased.78   Sparrow and Braithwaite have separately developed detailed policy prescriptions for the \ndesign of regulatory performance measures.79   \n \nIn the context of enforcement, such performance sensitivity requires that the regulator is capable of \nmeasuring whether the enforcement tools and strategies in current use are proving successful in \nachieving desired objectives. This will demand not merely an assessment of the performance of the \n                                                 \n77 Waller also  refers to this, describing it as \u2018institutional integrity\u2019: V. Waller, \u2018The Challenge of Institutional Integrity \nin Responsive Regulation: Field Inspections by the Australian Tax Office\u2019 (2007) 1 Law and Policy 67. \n78 Selznick, loc. cit. p.472. \n79 Sparrow, loc. cit. \n 20 \nexisting regime but also an understanding of the activities that detract from the achievement of \nobjectives but are beyond the scope of the current regulatory regime or which are \u2018off the screen\u2019 in the \nsense that they are going undetected \u2013 what Sparrow would refer to as \u2018invisible\u2019 offences.\u201980 If this first \nchallenge is not met, the regulator will not be in a position to judge whether changes in tools or \nstrategies are called for or to estimate what kinds of changes are needed. This evaluation will be \ndemand an analysis of the fit between the relevant rules or requirements and the regulatory body\u2019s \nobjectives.  \n \nPerformance sensitivity, moreover, rests on the regime\u2019s ability both to assess its performance in \nthe light of its objectives and to modify its tools and strategies accordingly.81  Such modification, it \nis important to note,  might involve radical shifts of strategy \u2013 such as an emphasis on the  \nreincetivising or reorganising of an industry rather than a continued stress on enforcing the current \nregime of rules. \n \nDeveloping robust systems of performance assessment  is, however, a notoriously difficult task.  Each \nof the four main approaches to performance assessment, input, process, output and outcome \nassessments, has its own logic, is useful for different purposes, and, in turn, is of relevance to different \nparts of the regulatory organisation and its evaluators.82  Input based assessment of performance is \ncommon: the measurement of numbers of inspectors and inspections, resources devoted to control and \nother inputs.  Process or compliance based assessment is also common: measuring adherence to \nprocedural requirements and other laws, policies or guidelines.  What is less common is either output \nbased assessment: measuring the extent to which the goals of the specific programme are achieved, or \nlonger term outcome based assessments:  evaluating the impact of the regulatory system against the \nbroad objectives of the agency (rather than the specific programme).  The difficulties of assessment are \ncompounded in polycentric regulatory regimes, and rely critically on cooperation if the accountability \nand learning functions of performance evaluation are to be met.83 \n                                                 \n80 See Sparrow, op.cit, pp.192, 272-3. \n81 As we discuss below, these modifications may require legal or policy changes which can only be made by others at \nthe national or supranational (eg EU) level.      \n82 Performance evaluation is a key part of the better regulation agenda: see eg NAO, Measuring the Performance of \nGovernment Departments (London, 2001); OECD, Results Based Management in the Development Co-operation \nAgencies: A View of Experience, (OECD, 1999)  OECD, Working Party on Regulatory Management and Reform, \nRegulatory Performance: Ex Post Evaluation of Regulatory Tools and Institutions , GOV\/PGC\/REG (2006)6 (OECD, \n2004).  On the difficulties of assessing performance see eg P. Hopkinson, P. James, A. Sammut, \u2018Environmental \nperformance evaluation in the water industry of England and Wales\u2019 (2000) 43(6) Journal of Environmental Planning \nand Management 873-896; on responses to performance evaluation see eg S. Modell, Performance Measurement and \nInstitutional Processes: A Study of Managerial Responses to Public Sector Reform\u2019 (2001) (12) Management \nAccounting Research 437; G. Bevan and C. Hood, \u2018What\u2019s Measured is What Matters: Targets and Gaming in the \nEnglish Healthcare System\u2019 (2006) 84(3) Public Administration 517. \n83 F-B van der Meer and J. Edelenbos, \u2018Evaluation in Multi-Actor Policy Processes: Accountability, Learning and \nCooperation\u2019 (2006) 12(2) Evaluation 201. \n 21 \n \nReally responsive regulation pinpoints the need to assess performance not only on a continuing basis, \nbut also in a manner that takes on board those shifts in objectives and regulatory environments that have \nbeen referred to above. Really responsive regulation does not eradicate the difficulties of performance \nassessment but, by placing assessment at the core of regulatory activity, it may facilitate its execution \u2013 \ninsofar as it encourages the creation of ongoing systems and processes that will produce relevant data in \na timely and organised manner.  \n \nResponsiveness to Change \n \nFinally, in order to be really responsive, regulatory strategies have to adapt to movements in regulatory \npriorities, circumstances and objectives. These changes may be driven by factors internal to the \nregulator or imposed on the regulator from outside. Thus, shifts may be due to policy adjustments by \nthe regulator or because of developments in such matters as attitudes and preferences, industrial \npractices and technologies, types of regulated actors, numbers of concerns regulated or governmental \npolicies and legislation or other changes in the institutional environment.  The set of regulatory tools \nand strategies that is optimal will vary according to differences in the regulatory environment. If, for \ninstance, governments make large scale taxation, policy or legal changes, or if they allow new markets \nto develop, this is likely to affect the kind of regulatory and enforcement  regime that best achieves \ndesired objectives as given area.  If, for example, the government  introduces an emissions trading \nscheme to control a toxic water pollutant that is used in a certain production process, the Environment \nAgency might be well-advised to reconsider its use of command \u2013based controls over that substance.  \n \nThe challenge for regulators, in such a context, is to operate systems that are sensitive to such changes \nand can adapt accordingly. The difficulty with pyramidic and risk based systems is that they incorporate \nno core mechanism that assesses the need for systemic and strategic change \u2013 and evaluates this on the \nbasis of evidence. Proponents of responsive regulation might, it should be noted, point here to the \n\u2018pyramid of regulatory strategies.\u201984  This pyramid, however, involves the state in signalling to \nindustries that it will escalate strategies from self-regulation towards externally imposed command \nregimes. What it does not offer is an explanation of how the need for such escalation is to be assessed \nand how escalation is to be managed in a world of change. Similarly, advocates of \u2018smart regulation\u2019 \nwould remind us that unsatisfactory regulatory outcomes can be dealt with in their system by the \nprocess of \u2018sequencing\u2019 regulatory instruments.85 The idea behind sequencing is that \u201ccertain \n                                                 \n84 Ayres and Braithwaite, op.cit., pp.38-40. \n85 Gunningham and Gabosky, op.cit., pp.444-7. \n 22 \ninstruments would be held in reserve, only to be applied as  and when other instruments demonstrably \nfail to meet pre-determined performance benchmarks. Logically, such sequencing would follow a \nprogression of increasing levels of intervention.\u201d86 As with responsive regulation, however, smart \nregulation leaves work to be done to explain what is involved in evaluating success or failure or the \nrationales for adopting one rather than another method of sequencing.   In the case of risk based \nregulation, any capacity of the regime to respond to changes in regulatory objectives or environments is \ndependent on the capacity of the system to collect information on the need for such changes and to act \non such information through revisions in risk calculations and weightings. A problem with the risk \nbased approach, however, is that, as noted, it will tend to focus on existing high level risks rather than \nsmaller, cumulative, or newly emergent risks. It will tend to be blind to risks that are not picked up in \nthe existing analysis and has no core method of identifying new regulatory challenges and adjusting to \nthese. \n \nCommentators such as John Braithwaite are, of course, not unaware that the processes of regulatory \nrealignment involve challenges or that contentious issues attend the control of regulatory reshapings.   \nIn a recent article Braithwaite has pointed out that within networked regimes (in which regulatory \nfunctions and responsibilities are spread across numbers of organisations of different types)  there are \ndangers of oligarchic power and issues of access to policy frameworks.87  He suggests that the \nrepublican ideal is that contests between interests should act to prevent domination and that this joins \nwith the responsive approach to offer a \u2018combined ideal\u2026 that pyramidal escalation to contest \ndomination drives contestation down to the deliberative base of the pyramid so that regulation is \nconversational\u201988 It might be unduly optimistic, however, to assume that such ideals will commonly be \nrealised so that regulatory conversations steer and shape regulatory systems in optimal ways. There are \ndangers, as indicated, that, within networked regimes,  undue influence may be exercised by certain \ninterests, that the parties in such conversations may lack good information on regulatory performance \nand that desirable regulatory changes may not take place because of deadlocks and disagreements. A \nreally responsive regulation approach suggests that positive steps have to be taken to rise to the \nchallenges first, of encouraging performance sensitivity through assessment procedures and, second, of \nfostering the capacity of regimes to change regulatory direction so as to adapt to changes in  \ncircumstances,  priorities and objectives, including the cultivation of changes in organisational culture \nand intra-organisational dynamics that may be needed to respond to these changes.89 \n                                                 \n86 Ibid, p. 444. \n87 Braithwaite, op. cit. (2006).  See also L. O\u2019Toole and K. Meier, \u2018Desperately Seeking Networks: Cooptation and the \nDark Side of Public Management in Networks\u2019 (2004) 64(6) Public Administration Review 681. \n88 Braithwaite, op. cit (2006), p. 893. \n89 See eg Black op. cit., (2005); J. Job, A. Stout and R. Smith, \u2018Culture Change in Three Taxation Administrations: \nFrom Command and Control to Responsive Regulation (2007) 29(1) Law and Policy 84. \n 23 \n \nThe need to address these challenges is again arguably the more urgent when, as is common, regulatory  \nsystems involve numbers of regulatory bodies operating different types of controls \u2013 i.e. when  \nregulatory regimes are networked rather than simple. If networked regulatory   regimes are to be shaped \nby complex contests and conversations, it is essential that such processes operate against a background \nof cooperation and good information concerning the performance of the extant regime. Assessing \nperformance across networked regimes is, of course, considerably more difficult than measuring the \neffects of a simple command sytem but that difficulty makes the need to rise to the challenge the more \nurgent. The greater the potential for confusion in a regulatory system, the stronger is the case for \nassessing whether current methods and mixes are working well or badly. \n \nSimilar arguments can be made for meeting  the challenge of ensuring that systems can be adjusted and \nmodified on the basis of assessments of performance. There are real dangers that networked, smart, \nregulatory regimes lock their involved actors into agreed positions and approaches so that salutary \nreforms cannot be brought into effect. In an ideal world, conversations between networked regulatory \nactors might be expected to produce desirable regulatory adjustments. In a less than ideal world, such \nconversations may lead to confusions, entrenched positions, inabilities to respond to regulatory failures \nand blame shifting. What may be needed are strategies for encouraging appropriate programmes of \nmodification. \n \nWhat \u2018really responsive regulation\u2019 sets out to do is to offer a framework for regulation which is \nresponds to firms\u2019 attitudinal settings, recognises the significance of the institutional environment (or \n\u2018regulatory character\u2019), which develops an awareness of the differential nature of the logics of different \nregulatory tools and strategies, which is performance sensitive, and which responds to change.  All are \nfairly formidable tasks.  The next section draws on empirical work we conducted with the UK \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and work done by the UK National Audit \nOffice on Defra\u2019s regulation of sea fishing. It explores how a  really responsive regulation approach \ncould be applied  in regulatory enforcement and  does so by delineating the particular elements of (or \ntasks involved in) inspection, compliance and enforcement activities;  by noting  the challenges \ninvolved in each of these; and by outlining what a really responsive regulatory response would bring to \nthe analysis of enforcement.  \n \n \n \n \n 24 \n3. Regulatory Enforcement: A Framework of Tasks \n \nIn introducing our argument we stated that a   \u2018really responsive\u2019 regulation approach needs to be \napplied across all of the different tasks that are involved in regulatory activity.   In the case of \nenforcement, this requires that the enforcement function is broken down into its different elements. We \npropose that there are five such elements or tasks.90 These involve detecting undesirable or non-\ncompliant behaviour, developing tools and strategies for responding to that behaviour, enforcing those \ntools and strategies on the ground, assessing their success or failure and modifying approaches \naccordingly.91 \n \nThese tasks should not be seen as necessarily moving in a neat linear progression; in reality they are all \ninterlinked and performance in relation to one of them may impact on the discharge of another, either \npositively or negatively. Thus, for example, tools or strategies which are used for detecting non-\ncompliant  behaviour can serve as positive bases for assessments of performance or even for prompting \ncompliance (eg speed cameras or random inspections). In contrast, certain enforcement styles may have \nnegative effects on the processes of detection or assessment (as where a prosecution strategy alienates \nregulatees, cuts off information flows to the regulator and impedes the processes of  detection and \nperformance measurement).  Distinguishing these five tasks provides a framework for identifying those \nchallenges that are encountered in carrying out  a number of very different functions.  It directly \naddresses the need to deal with change through performance assessment and strategic modification. It \nallows us to examine the different approaches that can be adopted in meeting these challenges and it \nalso illuminates the nature of interactions between responses to the different challenges.  It can be \napplied with a focus on addressing statutory or policy objectives in general terms or in dealing with \ndisaggregations of these into more narrowly described issues or problems.  \n \nThis framework can also be represented, as in Table 1, as key questions that really responsive regulators \nwill consider in dealing with those concerns and tasks. \n \n \n                                                 \n90 Other aspects of regulation can, similarly, be seen as comprising   numbers of different tasks \u2013 to which a really \nresponsive approach can be applied.

In offering this account we hope to show how a really responsive regulation approach \nprovides a more holistic approach, and as such takes preceding approaches forward.  \n \n3.1 Detection: the Identification of Non-compliant and Undesirable Behaviour \n \nUncovering undesirable behaviour through detection is a first step in regulatory enforcement. Detection \nchallenges are, however, often severe. Our research into enforcement in a number of divisions of the \nU.K Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) drew attention to the following \npotential  problems. Enforcers often face extreme difficulties in detecting errant behaviour when the \nregulated community is extensive (as where certain environmental controls cover the whole population) \nand where breaching rules is cheap and easily carried out in a clandestine manner. Resourcing realities \noften mean that enforcers have to rely on tip offs from the public or hot-lines and whistleblowing \nprocesses. As a result, the regulators will receive a good deal of unreliable information and will \ncommonly be ill-placed to calculate the real level of \u2018off the screen\u2019 activity that detracts from the \nachievement of objectives.  \n \nIn fisheries regulation, as noted above, detection of non-compliance is particularly difficult for a \nnumber of reasons.92 The geographical areas to be covered are extremely extensive and regulatees \nare mobile; enforcement involves numbers of bodies with complex overlappings of jurisdictions and \n                                                 \n92 See NAO Report, pp.19-20.  It is not unique in this respect; many other areas of regulatory activity pose significant \ndetection problems, notably tax evasion, financial crime, misselling of consumer products (notably credence goods), \nmany areas of professional conduct (eg legal or medical malpractice), and many areas of environmental or health and \nsafety regulation, particularly but not uniquely where there are difficulties in showing causation. \n 27 \nresponsibilities; there are a large number of landing sites in England; inspection at sea is very \nresource intensive; and there are very many ways to avoid detection.  There are also numerous \nplaces to conceal illegal catches of which inspectors are unaware; and resources only allow a very \nsmall proportion of vessels and landings to be inspected.93  The quota control system, as a result, \ninvolves heavy reliance on the self-reporting of catches and there is very extensive under-reporting \nand mis-declaration of fish landed.  (The majority of infringements detected concern the falsifying \nof such information). 94  Two central problems aggravated difficulties when the NAO conducted its \nreview.  The number of undetected infringements was \u2018impossible to determine\u201995 because of the \nnature of the industry and, in addition, the enforcers had no clear set of priorities and outcome \nobjectives to work from.96  \n \nA lack of clear objectives can make it extremely difficult to state what \u2018compliance\u2019 involves, in \nfisheries as in other areas, and the problem of constructing an agreed understanding can be bedevilled \nby legal uncertainties. The latter sometimes stem from drafting weakness but, divergences of \nunderstanding between the judiciary and the regulators can also prove a problem-notably regarding the \npurposes and objectives of the regulation at issue.  In cases where there are unresolved disagreements \non the meaning of compliance, this renders detection activity extremely fraught.  \n \nResourcing constitutes a perennial constraint on detection. In many controlled areas the calculation of \nlevels of compliance and the incidence of  \u2018off the screen\u2019 activity would demand the operation of \nregistration schemes or the carrying out of surveys but funds may not permit such activities. In other \ndomains such surveys are conducted and, in many sectors, programmes of random inspection are used \nto obtain relevant data. In yet other areas, detection can only be carried out after the event and this \nimpedes precautionary enforcement.  \n  \nIn responding to these challenges regulators must first develop  clear conceptions of their aims and an \nappropriate disaggregation of those objectives into subsidiary aims so that, achievable targets can be set \nand problems identified in a manageable way.97  This construction of aims and disaggregation of \nobjectives will necessarily be shaped by its own internal and external institutional environment, and as \nsuch may be one which is challenged by politicians, regulatees and \/ or the broader public (as the \n                                                 \n93 See NAO Report, pp.19-20. \n94 See NAO Report, p.16. \n95 NAO Report, pp.2,15. \n96 NAO Report, p. 39. The first recommendation of the Net Benefits report was that clear hierarchies of fisheries \nmanagement objectives should be developed  ( Net Benefits ,p. 11). Defra responded with a statement of overarching \naim, supported by more detailed objectives \u2013 see Securing the Benefits, p. 3.  \n97 Sparrow, pp.146-9. \n 28 \ndiscussion on risk based regulation above illustrates).  Nonetheless, if this is not done, the regulators \nwill not know what sort of errant behaviour they need to detect.  Regulatory objectives, moreover, may \nchange over time and, in addition, the threats to achieving objectives may shift continuously. A \nregulator, of say, fisheries will thus have to deal with changes in priorities regarding the protection of \ndifferent species of fish (or regarding protecting fish versus protecting employment), it will also face \nemerging risks from innovative fishing technologies and new fishing enterprises.  \n \nSecondly, in such a state of flux it is essential to be able to identify levels and patterns of compliance.  \nBut change poses challenges.  New methods of avoiding the rules or concealing non-compliance may \nbe devised constantly. Enterprises may be creatively complying with or breaking the rules in innovative \nways. A given set of rules or a licensing regime may be impacting on enterprises less than it did \nformerly. A regulator, accordingly, needs to be able to detect not merely the levels of non-compliance \nwith requirements but also the extent of any \u2018off the screen\u2019 or \u2018invisible\u2019 black market activity that \naffects the achieving of the agency\u2019s legitimate objectives.  Thirdly, regulators have to assess the extent \nto which compliance with the relevant legal requirements will not be enough to achieve agency \nobjectives.  In a world of change, with new problems and strategies for escaping the rules, it is essential \nto know, in a continuing manner, the gap between rules and objectives.  \n \nThese are issues that are often left out of account in approaches to enforcement.  Pyramidic systems \ntend to focus attention on the need to ensure compliance rather than to develop intelligence on the \nextent to which compliance falls short of objectives.98 Risk based systems look more directly towards \nobjectives but as discussed above they have their own risks, in particular  of focusing on a given set of \nrisks and a given approach to addressing them, and of  under-emphasising the need to detect new and \n\u2018off the screen\u2019 activities of a non-compliant or undesirable nature.99  \n \nIn contrast, the really responsive regulatory body would seek to detect such matters and develop ways \nto assess how reliable its detection processes are. It is, after all, only through performance sensitivity - \nby knowing the reliability of its detection (and, indeed, other  procedures)  - that it can form a view on \nsuch matters as levels of compliance and the balance between activities that are covered by regulation \nand those that escape the system. Such detection  and assessment processes are essential, moreover, if \nthe regulatory regime is to be adjusted so as to extend its coverage to previously uncontrolled \nbehaviour.  \n                                                 \n98 But see smart regulation\u2019s taking on the need to go \u2018beyond compliance\u2019 in Gunningham et. al.  op. cit.  p. 153 and N. \nGunningham, \u2018Beyond Compliance\u2019 in B. Boer et al (eds) Environmental  Outlook : Law and Policy (Sydney, ACEL \nFedn. Press, 1994) \n99 See Sparrow op.cit pp.273-5. \n 29 \n \nDealing with change is thus a key issue for the really responsive regulator.  In a fluid world it is \nnecessary not only to develop but to adjust detection techniques to meet new challenges. Enforcement, \nmoreover, is not a mechanical process in which the fact of compliance, is a given, easily identifiable \nmatter. As many have observed, compliance is often \u2018constructed\u2019 through processes of negotiations \nbetween different actors in the regulatory arena.100  Detection strategies, accordingly, have to respond  \nto shifts in concepts and constructions of compliance and have to relate such shifts to the achieving of \nregulatory objectives, changes in constructions of objectives, and changes in the translation of \nobjectives into targets and problems. Adjustments of regulatory logic, in turn, have to be made.  \n \nThe really responsive regulatory body  will not only  lay the foundations for its detection and other \nwork by establishing clarity on objectives, it will be clear regarding  the regulatory logic that it will \napply. This will not necessarily involve a single logic \u2013 be that purely punitive, restorative or restitutive,  \nfor example.  What really responsive regulation should involve is coherence so that the regulator is \nclear about the role of different individual logics in relation to the task of detection, and in addition with \nrespect to the tasks of response development, enforcement, assessment and modification. Regulators \nshould have a view, for example, on the sorts of risks and risk creators that will demand first instance \nuse of rehabilitative logics for the purposes of detection, response development, and so on.     \n \nThe really responsive regulator will also take on board the issue of attitudinal settings and how this \naffects the carrying out of detection or other tasks.  Of particular concern may be instances where \nthere are conflicts or tensions between the attitudes of the regulators and those of the regulatees.  In \nthe fisheries sector the NAO unearthed examples of conflict in such attitudes. Thus, the NAO \nreview noted that: \n \n\u2018Regulations may lead fishermen to act in ways which they regard as unnatural, for example, having \nto throw fish back into the sea to preserve their quota by only landing the best quality fish or to avoid \nexceeding quota.\u2019101 \n \nThis finding evidenced a tension between the cultures of fishermen and of the command- based  \nDefra  regime.  It  pointed  to a clash between  the assumptions and ideas that respectively  \nanimated  the regulatees and the regulators. The NAO finding, moreover, showed how such \ntensions could prejudice communications. Here the \u2018unnaturalness\u2019 of throwing dead fish back into \nthe sea was likely to undermine self-regulation through voluntary compliance; to lead fishermen to \n                                                 \n100 See e.g. K. Hawkins Law as Last Resort (Oxford, OUP, 2002) Chapter 8.  \n101 NAO Report ,p.19. \n 30 \nland  such  fish \u2018off-screen \u2019; and  to fail to declare such catches. This practice of non-declaration \nwas liable, in turn, to impact on the command regime by  undermining  not only the communication \nand detection of non-compliance with quotas but also the enforcement of those quotas  and the \nbroader  Defra  system for  assessing and modifying the detection and enforcement systems. \n \nInstitutional environments also have to be taken on board. In relation to many regulated activities, \nenforcement is carried out, as noted,  by a network of different bodies \u2013 agencies, local authorities and \nothers. These will often enforce the same legislation in different ways and will possess different \nsystems for gathering information on regulatory activities and compliance. Such institutional \nfragmentation stands in the way of the easy evaluation of detection procedures and has to be responded \nto with efforts to coordinate, harmonise or rationalise.  \n \nBroader institutional settings may also impact on the effective detection of non-compliance and the \nestimation of \u2018off the screen\u2019 activity. In the U.K the Government\u2019s general stance on reducing \ninformational burdens on business does not encourage the surveying of industrial activity and in a \nnumber of important fields, the regulated industry proves highly defensive in the face of regulation. \nEnterprises themselves tend to be important reserves of information on compliance and, as a result, \ntheir non-cooperation is likely to impede detection work and the use of quasi-regulatory sources of data \n(such as trade associations). One strategy that can be used to respond to such opposition is, however, to \ninvoke the aid of business associations in attempting to deal with those maverick, unlicensed and \nunregulated operators that are seen by the regulators as sources of off the screen undesirable behaviour \nand by the organised industry as providers of competition that is unfair due to avoidance of compliance \ncosts. A further strategy that can be employed where there are serious problems with maverick \noffenders is to offer incentives to encourage subjection to the regulatory system (e.g. by making access \nto markets dependent on this) or by encouraging general \u2018buy-in\u2019 to regulation across the industry.  \n \nSuch difficulties of detection are considerable, but have to be faced up to if regulatory enforcement is to \nfurther the achievement of objectives. If non-compliant and errant behaviour is not detected, it cannot \nbe dealt with by a tit for tat or any other strategy. If levels of compliance and undesirable behaviour are \nnot known it will be impossible to work towards optimal regulation to meet changes and new \nchallenges or to evaluate performance and estimate whether resources spent on regulation are \nworthwhile. A really responsive regulation approach highlights detection challenges and links these to \nother tasks but also demands that we deal with issues of attitudinal setting, institutional environment, \nthe logics of tools, performance sensitivity and the perennial difficulty of changing circumstances. \n \n 31 \n3.2  Response: Developing Rules and Tools  \n \nA second core task of regulatory enforcement is the development of those rules and tools that are fit for \npurpose in both detecting non-compliance or undesirable behaviour and in producing compliance with \nrelevant requirements. Within the responsive regulation approach the central focus is the use of a \nhierarchy of enforcement tools as applied through a process of potential escalation.  It is easy to assume \nthat a full array of tools is always available and that the given toolkit or set of rules is appropriate on a \ncontinuing basis.   In practice, however, few regulators possess the luxury of a full toolkit.  In our \nresearch for Defra we identified over forty enforcement tools which are deployed by regulators in the \nUK, the US and Australia across a number of domains.   They can be grouped into seven main types \n(irrespective of their legal form): tools relating to the   continuation of business \/ operations (eg licence \namendments \/ revocations; disqualifications; imposition of restrictions on activities; seizure of \nequipment \/ assets and so on); monetary or financial tools (eg fines, disgorgement of profits orders); \nrestorative tools (remediation orders; restorative conferences); undertaking and compliance \nmanagement tools (eg voluntary or enforceable undertakings, compliance assistance, compliance \naudits); performance disclosure (eg individual naming and shaming, league tables).  These are \nobviously in addition to the pre-enforcement tools: warnings, notices etc, that may be issued as a \nprelude to more formal action being taken, and the role of investigations and other detection activities \nin prompting compliance.   \n \nIf a regulator lacks a tool this may be no peripheral matter. The absence of a relevant tool may bring \nserious consequences for enforcers.  For example, in addressing fly tipping, officials lobbied hard \nfor new tools (on the spot administrative penalties) to help address the problem.102 Other potentially \nvaluable tools that enforcement officials seek, raised in our 2005 research, included registration \nprocesses, charging mechanisms, and banning orders.  In the fisheries field, the NAO found that a \nnumber of powers and tools that were employed in other countries were not yet used in England.103 \nThese potential tools included:  imposing restrictions on the places where fish can be sold;  placing \nobservers on vessels; adopting Individual Transferable Quotas for fishermen; increasing the \ninvolvement of the industry in enforcement; and funding more inspections through the sale of \n\u2018beyond quota\u2019 fish.  Defra has now taken some steps to improve its toolkit. It has deployed new \nsatellite technologies; introduced a Designated Port Scheme; 104 set up joint operations with other \nfishing authorities; extended inspections in international waters; and conducted more surprise \ninspections. At the time of the NAO Report, Defra was also considering introducing an approved \n                                                 \n102  Defra, Fly- tipping Strategy  (London,  Defra, 2004) \n103 NAO Report, p.4. \n104 Which requires larger vessels to land catches at specific ports. \n 32 \nagent restriction on the sale of fish and a system of administrative penalties allowing temporary \nsuspensions of fishing licences.105 \n \nEnsuring that enforcement tools are \u2018really responsive\u2019 is a significant task.  Our 2005 research \nhighlighted a number of challenges. In the first instance, enforcers have to be performance sensitive \u2013 \nthey must  possess systems of performance assessment that tell them whether they need to adjust or \nexpand their tool kits \u2013 this is a matter returned to below. In addition,  even those who are aware of \ntheir needs for new enforcement tools and who  are open to designing and using new tools106 have to \nhave the capacity to adjust tools in order to improve performance or adjust to changing circumstances \nand challenges. Enforcers are, however, often constrained in their development of new tools by a \nnumber of factors \u2013 including institutional environments. Legislation may often be needed in order to \nintroduce new powers and it is common for officials to consider that new legislation (even secondary \nlegislation) is an unrealistic political prospect. Existing bodies of legislation (particularly European \nDirectives) are often seen as constraints on the use of new tools and uncertainties in legislative \nrequirements tend to blight creative approaches to new tools. Government policies and institutional \nfactors are also often seen as an impediment to new tool use \u2013 especially when these involve \ndispersions of regulatory responsibility across a number of bodies or where attention is directed at \nenforcing existing tools to the detriment of forward looks at new powers.   Resource constraints, as \never, constitute a hurdle - especially where these stand in the way of the surveying or inspection \nexercises that are needed in order to reveal the true incidence of non-compliance or unwanted activity \nand hence the need for new tools and strategies.  Really responsive regulators will, in addition, examine \nthe way that different attitudinal settings and tool logics will affect both the way that particular controls \noperate and the manner in which tools can be combined. As was seen in discussing detection work, a \ntool that operates with a self-regulatory logic (such as a system of catch declaration) will tend to operate \ninefficiently if it is at odds with the regulatees\u2019 attitudinal settings \u2013 as where a fish quota and catch \ndeclaration system involves the \u2018unnaturalness\u2019 of offloading freshly caught (and dead) fish into the \nsea.  \n \n \n                                                 \n105 See NAO Report p. 5. Defra\u2019s 2004 Review of Marine Fisheries report (hereafter \u2018Review of Marine Fisheries\u2019 ) \n(p.13) outlined how, following the NAO report, satellite surveillance was extended as was the designated port system . \nOther changes in the Defra programme of enforcement reforms included more extensive designation of markets, \nregistrations of buyers and sellers of first sale fish, improvements in boxing arrangements, wider use of single species \nlicensing and more use of administrative measures. See also the Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, Net Benefits (March \n2004) and the Marine Bill Consultation document (March 2006). In June 2006 the Defra Minister Ben Bradshaw \nannounced that new enforcement powers for Sea Fisheries Committees would be introduced in the Marine Bill. \nProposals consulted on included a new administrative penalties scheme. \n106 The evidence in Defra was that many enforcers are indeed open to designing and using new tools. \n 33 \n3.3    Enforcement: Strategies for Applying Tools  \n \nEnforcement is a matter of deploying a strategy or mixture of strategies for securing desired results \non the ground. The NAO found that Defra fisheries regulators prioritised inspections according to \nbroad \u2013 based risk analyses which tended to target particular fisheries and types of activity rather \nthan individual vessels.107 Thus, surveillance operations and inspections tended to focus on areas of \nhigh risk where quotas were most restrictive, stocks were of high value, fishing activity was intense, \nfish were known to be collecting or fisheries were seasonal. Inspections also tended to be \nconcentrated on points where the regulatory returns to interventions would have been greatest \u2013 for \nexample on those ports where landings were, given the circumstances, most likely.  Major \ndifficulties encountered in using such risk \u2013 based approaches lay in coming to terms with new risk \ncreators and new risks to fish stocks. The extent of \u2018off screen\u2019 activities also tended to undermine \nthe reliability of the data underpinning the risk analyses. \n \nA message offered by really responsive regulation is that it is essential to examine how the logics of \ndifferent regulatory tools and strategies interact. Such interactions may be positive or negative.  \nWhere there are conflicts these can impede the achieving of objectives. For example, in \nuncultivated land regulation, the Defra task of stopping unauthorised cultivation of this land was \nhindered because acrimonious litigation arising from the prosecution of vague laws removed the \ncooperation of the National Farmers Union, and farmers generally, so that advisory and educational \nwork was difficult to carry out successfully.108  Conflicting logics can impede not only the \napplication of a tool or strategy but its development.  In the area of cattle identification, the logic of \nthe European Directive regime drastically constrained the introduction of the enforcement methods \nthat Defra staff wanted to develop, because of the European focus on command and control \ninspection and prosecution meant that alternative enforcement strategies and tools were given low \npolicy priority.  \n \nOn the positive front, the proponents of  \u2018smart  regulation\u2019 suggest, with respect to ex ante \nregulatory strategies, that there may be a good deal to be achieved by combining  different logics, \ntools and strategies. Regulatory enforcement tools and strategies are often applied so as to achieve a \nnumber of purposes (e.g. detection and information gathering as well as compliance seeking), and \nare based on different logics. Attention should accordingly be paid to positive interactions and \ncombinations of tools, strategies and  logics as these are encountered in dealing with specific \n                                                 \n107 See NAO Report, p. 20. \n108 See R. Baldwin and J Black, A Review of Enforcement Measures ( Defra , November 2005) \n 34 \nregulatory tasks \u2013 how, for instance,  risk based regulation\u2019s difficulties in detecting new risks and \nrisk creators can be addressed by resort to a degree of random, regional and routine enforcement. \nThe inherent bias in risk based systems towards controlling \u2018high probability, high impact\u2019 firms \ncan be balanced by the use of alternative enforcement strategies. It will often be useful, for instance, \nto deploy a risk based approach together with one that is compliance based or educative, or \ndeterrence based, responsive, or target analytic.  \n \nReally responsive regulation can, similarly, suggest ways in which the messages of responsive \nregulation can be supplemented. Responsive regulation ranks enforcement tools in terms of punitive \nseverity (the enforcement pyramid can, indeed, be seen as a severity pyramid). A problem in practice, \nhowever, is that tools may rank differently according to context and regulation. To some firms, naming \nand shaming may be seen as non-punitive, to others it may be viewed as far more punitive than a fine. \nIn some contexts, moreover, it may be necessary to escape from the severity pyramid in favour of \nradically different control strategies. The  \u2018smart regulation\u2019 approach does not overcome such \ndifficulties by making the pyramid three dimensional \u2013 escalation still operates on a single punitive \naxis. The really responsive regulation  perspective, though,  does offer more assistance by dealing head \non with the issue of logics. It also takes on board the \u2018attitudinal setting\u2019109 of the firm. This will impact \non the way the firm perceives and reacts to different control tools (say, naming and shaming) and \nadverting to issues of attitudinal setting adds a dimension to analyses of logics and the interactions of \nthese. Really responsive regulation thus provides a basis for assessing how best to apply a pyramidic \napproach to enforcement, for judging how responsive and other approaches can be combined, and for \nevaluating whether it is necessary to change logics \u2013 to move, for instance, from punitive to other \nmodes of influence such as positive incentives or market-based mechanisms. Here there is a  further \ncontrast between \u2018 responsive\u2019 and \u2018really responsive\u2019  regulation \u2013  the former tends to focus on the \nbest ways to enforce a given set of regulatory rules or policy whereas the latter emphasises performance \nsensitivity and provides a basis for judging the case for instituting a sea-change in that policy.  \n \nReally responsive regulation also takes on board institutional environments.  Regulatory systems, as \nnoted, more often than not involve numbers of organisations and this is, again, illustrated by the \nfisheries field as described in the NAO\u2019s 2003 Report.110 At that time the European Union\u2019s \nCommon Fisheries Policy set the legal framework for regulation but the major enforcement \nfunction was carried out by Defra\u2019s Sea Fisheries Inspectorate in co-ordination with the twelve local \nauthority Sea Fisheries Committees. The Department, however, also used the services of the Royal \n                                                 \n109 For further discussion of \u2018attitudinal setting\u2019 see below, Section 4. \n 35 \nNavy Fishery Protection Squadron and it employed the private firm Directflight Limited to conduct \nsurveillance operations in co-ordination with the patrols of the Royal Navy.   \n \nSuch institutional complexities often impact on the application of different tools and strategies. In \nfisheries this was found to be the case when the NAO investigated. That body reported confusion \nabout the roles of the Committees and the Inspectorate; some duplications of inspections; \ninflexibilities in the deployment of resources across functions and institutions; and some complaints \nof over administration.111 In the fisheries field, however, the reporting process prompted some  \nresponsiveness to such issues -  at least in the form of institutional rationalisations that have been \ncarried out since the NAO analysis was published.112 Really responsive regulation, though, would \ndemand more than mere rationalisation (which can often recreate old problems within new \ninstitutional packages). It would point to the need to analyse  how variations in institutional \ncharacteristics and institutional interactivity affects, in quite particular ways, the carrying out of the \nvarious  tasks  that make up the process of regulatory enforcement. \n    \n3.4       Assessment  \n \nA fourth task within  regulatory enforcement is the development of performance sensitivity through \nprocesses that evaluate not only how well the current system is being enforced but which also calculate \nhow much undesirable activity is escaping the impact of the current network of controls. This task \ninvolves assessing the strength of the case for developing new tools, or adopting new enforcement \nstrategies or moving towards a new design of regulatory regime. Performance assessment is thus \ncentrally important for the progressive development of regulatory policies and is integral to good \nregulatory management \u2013 especially across complex networks of state and other controls. It is also \nessential to accountability and transparency insofar as assessments provide measures of progress in \nmeeting objectives and their publication enhances openness.  \n \nThe practical challenges are significant, however.  Our 2005 research into Defra enforcement highlights \na number of points. First, accurate assessments of overall effectiveness cannot be made (even within a \nsingle \u2013 operator, single tool regime)  unless the regulator is  able to calculate not only levels of non-\n                                                                                                                                                                  \n110 NAO Report,p p. 34-5 \n111 Ibid p. 35. \n112 Defra established a new Marine Fisheries Agency in October 2005 to separate policy development from the delivery \nof enforcement and it also  set up a new Marine Fisheries Directorate. In 2006 a Regional Fisheries Manager for SW \nEngland was created as a pilot for further co-ordinating reforms. On the drive for such changes see e.g. Prime \nMinister\u2019s Strategy Unit, Net Benefits (March 2004) ; Defra, Securing the Benefits ( July 2005); Securing the Benefits \u2013 \nA Stocktake (July 2006). \n 36 \ncompliance but levels of \u2018off screen\u2019 non-compliance -  errant behaviour which is beyond the reach of \nthe regulatory regime yet  is relevant to the achievement of objectives. Second, clarity of legal and \npolicy objectives is a precondition of effective assessment. Third, risk based systems can provide a \nready means of effecting year on year comparisons of performance \u2013 risk scores can be compared quite \neasily.  Such systems, however, will not measure the effects of regulation on parties outside the system, \nand are quite easily manipulated by officials.  Fourth, the natural inclination to focus on enforcement \ninputs (which offer cheaper, quicker and more reliable statistics to be gathered) has to be balanced with \nefforts to measure outcomes on the ground.  Fifth, in some regulated areas it is possible to identify \n\u2018short cut\u2019 measures of effectiveness \u2013 thus in relation to pesticides it may be feasible to analyse \nresidues in water and use this as an indicator. Finally, where responsibilities for enforcement are \nunclear, or spread across numbers of institutions, this may impede the accurate assessment of \neffectiveness \u2013 because of coordination difficulties, institutional politics or divergencies in data \ncollection and processing methods.  Rationalisation of regulatory responsibilities may accordingly offer \nways to improve assessments, but only where, as noted, old co-ordination problems are not simply \ncontained in a new organisational wrapper,113 or rationalisation does not produce its own.  \n \nFisheries provide further evidence of the challenges of assessment.  In fisheries regulation a key \noutcome measure is state of stocks, but this is affected by many factors other than enforcement.114 \nLevels of compliance are also difficult to measure. As indicated, a considerable amount of non-\ncompliant activity goes on beyond the inspection regime and the NAO reported that it was  \nimpossible, in the then current system, to determine the number of undetected infringements.115  \nThese infringements related to both compliance with technical regulations and with the recording of \nlandings.  It was not physically possible to inspect enough vessels to ensure that landings were \naccurately recorded.116  Such difficulties drove the regulators towards secondary measures of \neffectiveness (e.g. probabilities of inspection)117 and to data on input activities (such as sea \ninspections, port visits and prosecutions). As a result, Defra was ill-placed to measure the \neffectiveness of its detection system, its enforcement system or its processes of assessment. Nor was \nit able accurately to judge the need to develop and apply new tools for detection, enforcement or \nassessment. \n \n                                                 \n113 See eg Black, op. cit., (2006). \n114 E.g. global environmental changes - see Review of Marine Fisheries, p.113. \n115 See NAO Report, pp.2, 15-18. \n116 See NAO Report, p. 3. \n117 Said by Defra to be \u2018probably the best readily obtainable measure of effectiveness\u2019 \u2013 Review of Marine Fisheries,  p. \n113. \n 37 \nThe lack of clear outcome objectives and benchmarks further undermined the assessment process in \nthis area118 and a separate difficulty reported by the NAO was that EU Member States placed \ndifferent interpretations on what constituted a serious infringement.119 Even within English \nenforcement, infringements in different inspection districts were not recorded in a consistent \nmanner. The NAO concluded that Defra was not able to monitor whether each district was dealing \nwith infringements appropriately or to construct a picture of the nature or frequency of \ninfringements so as to inform enforcement activity.120 \n \nA really responsive regulation approach helps to identify those key issues that have to be addressed \nif assessment processes are to prove valuable. Attitudinal settings have to be considered \u2013 as has \nbeen noted, if regulatees\u2019 mind-sets are at tension with recording systems (e.g. for fish landings) the \nassessment procedure will be undermined. Institutional environments have to be taken on board so \nthat there is co-ordination of data collection systems across different fisheries regulators and \nregulatees with their various budgetary and governance frameworks. The logics of different tools \nand strategies will also have to be considered since these impact on assessment processes. Where, \nfor instance, command and control methods are mixed with self-regulatory or advisory systems, \nthere may be tensions that, as noted, will prejudice information flows and data collection \nschemes.121 Performance sensitivity is, again, necessary since assessments have to be reflexive in \nthe sense that regulators must be able to measure their performance but also be able to evaluate the   \nstrengths or weaknesses of their measuring systems.  \n \nTo take an example: one proposal might be to protect fish stocks by awarding  Individual \nTransferable Quotas to fishermen ( which in effect give individuals tradable  property rights to sell \nspecific quantities of fish).122 The really responsive regulation framework would emphasise that \nsuch a system would change the regulatory roles of fishermen and Defra staff \u2013 with the market in \nquotas operating alongside the \u2018command\u2019 regime and taking over some of the functions of the \nregulator (e.g. allocating catch allowances). This would involve new mixes of attitudes, institutional \nresponsibilities and roles, so a really responsive regulation approach would involve examining how \nsuch a change would impact on the Defra-driven regime across the five regulatory enforcement \ntasks.  Possible findings might be that detection (and enforcement) would be enhanced because \nfishermen would have new inclinations to self-regulate and would be more inclined to inform on \n                                                 \n118 See NAO Report, p. 16, Net Benefits, p.11.. \n119 See NAO Report, p.16. \n120 See NAO Report, p. 24. \n121 R. Baldwin, \u2018Is Better Regulation Smarter Regulation?\u2019 [2005] Public Law 485. \n122 A system found in New Zealand and Iceland \u2013 see NAO Report, p. 22. \n 38 \nknown offenders.123 Such inclinations might impact positively beyond the trading system and on the \nwider command regime.  New response tools might be needed in order to identify good self- \nregulators within the trading system and any potential quota allocation difficulties that might flow \nfrom the market in permits and which might cut across the command system. New powers might be \nneeded to check on the validity of permits and the consistency of market trading practices with the \nachieving of target objectives. As a result, resources might have to be reallocated from the \ncommand system and towards permit validation \u2013 which would demand adjustment of strategies \nwithin the command system itself. Interactions between the trading system and existing \nenforcement strategies might be analysed so as to avoid tensions. Thus, the current risk-based \nregime might need to be adjusted so that the self-regulatory effects of the trading system are not \nundermined by decisions to prosecute (or even to inspect) that are driven by risk analyses. As for \nassessment processes, one challenge to be faced might be that the meaning of compliance within the \ntrading system does not correspond to that employed within the command regime. Such a \ndivergence would tend to undermine the measurement of  overall system performance and steps \nmight be needed to align data collection regimes. On modification, a really responsive regulation \napproach would prompt the question: How does operating a combined \u2018command\u2019 and \u2018trading\u2019 \nsystem affect the overall capacity of the regulatory regime to adjust to change by moving to a \nrevised approach? (Is there a danger that a trading system locks the regulator into a particular \npattern or level of stock allocation? Will the trading system comply with anticipated movements in \nthe EU Common Fisheries Policy?) \n \n3.5 Modification: The Adjustment of Tools and Strategies  \n \nThe fifth core task within regulatory enforcement is again ongoing and involves modifying the \nregulatory approach in a manner that is informed by prior assessments of performance.  Modification \nlinks to the other elements of the really responsive regulation framework. It takes on board the \nadjustments of responses \u2013 the tools and rules that are used for both detection and compliance seeking \npurposes and it also encompasses the modification of enforcement strategies themselves. As already \nsuggested, modification also demands a willingness to think \u2018outside the envelope\u2019 and  to consider \nwhether, instead of adjusting the tools and enforcement strategies within the current regulatory strategy, \nit is necessary to effect a \u2018third order\u2019 or \u2018paradigm shifting\u2019 change124 by adopting a new regulatory (as \n                                                 \n123 A reported finding in New Zealand and Iceland \u2013 see NAO Report, p.4. \n124 On the distinction between \u2018first order changes\u2019 of regulation (e.g. tunings is the given regulatory control as exemplified \nby a change in the X is a price control formula) versus \u2018second order changes\u2019 such as switches of instrument (e.g. from \nRPI-X to rate quantum price controls) versus \u2018third order changes\u2019 or \u2018paradigm shifts; (e.g. abandoning command and \ncontrol standards in favour of emissions trading) see J. Black, \u2018What is Regulatory Innovation?\u2019 in J. Black, M. Lodge and \nM. Thatcher, Regulatory Innovation (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2005). \n 39 \nopposed to enforcement) strategy (or mix of strategies) \u2013 for example, by moving from a  state-imposed \ncommand and control centred regime to a completely different regulatory style such as one giving \ncentrality to a scheme of  industry-administered guidance and training.  \n \nModification is an essential task since there is only limited value in assessing performance if the \nregime is not to be adjusted so as to improve performance.  Moreover, as the NAO report into \nfisheries also found, weaknesses in assessment systems can undermine capacities to modify \nprocesses.125 In that sector Defra was found by the NAO to operate inflexibly in its deployment of \nresources and people, which reduced its capacity to adjust its inspection strategies.126 A special \nproblem was lack of staff mobility which reduced operational responsiveness.127 What was clear to \nthe reviewers of the NAO was that a large number of strategic options were open to Defra but that \nthese had not been fully assessed, explored or put into effect.128 \n \nIn many regulatory  enforcement bodies there may be a case for raising awareness of the need to adjust \nregulatory  methods.  The evidence from our 2005 Defra research suggests that current training \ndeficiencies may be as much the product of resource constraints as of any other factors. Policymaking \ncultures may also contribute to excessive conservatism in regulation insofar as they prioritise moving \nforward to new policy challenges rather than assessing and modifying existing regimes. In contrast, \nhowever, there seem extensive indications that field inspectors and their managers possess a \nconsiderable (but unmet) appetite for revising and rethinking their enforcement approaches. A new \nemphasis on the  modification task and  adopting a really responsive regulation framework  is likely to \ndemand a shift of policymaking emphasis and a cultural change so that regulation is seen less as a \u2018one \nshot\u2019 operation, with the policy agenda moving on after the initial process of design to address other, \noften unrelated issues, and more as a constant process of evaluation and adjustment.129 This is not, \nhowever, to deny that in some respects  Defra has proved willing to introduce some  new tools and \nstrategies in the fisheries sector. It considered agents licensing and administrative penalties in 2002-3130 \nand, following the NAO review, it, inter alia,   developed its use of satellite surveillance and introduced \na Designated Ports Scheme.131 As also noted, however, assessment weaknesses will always undermine \nthe modification processes and Defra was also found by the NAO to operate inflexible systems  \n                                                 \n125 For discussion of changes post the NAO report see Review of Marine Fisheries. \n126 See NAO Report, p. 4. \n127 See NAO Report, p. 35. \n128 But for subsequent action see Marine Fisheries; Net Benefits, and  Securing the Benefits Review. \n129 See R.

Again, what really \nresponsive regulation would demand would be continuous attention to modification needs and to the \ndevelopment of such informational and assessment systems as would establish the performance \nsensitivity that is necessary to establish a sound basis for modification decisions. \n \nCapacities to cope with change are critical. Such changes may be driven by external institutions and \nfactors or may be internally generated. In fisheries, external drivers might include amendments in \nthe EU Common Fisheries Policy, new governmental decisions on resourcing, or special crises in \nfish stocks due to environmental changes. Internally, Defra may decide that there is a need to \nchange policies and objectives for its own political reasons. What the really responsive regulatory \nbody will be able to do is to assess the need for a given change, to see the implications across the \nfive regulatory enforcement tasks, and to  be able to modify the regime  in order to implement \nneeded changes.132 To take a specific example, the really responsive regulation approach would deal \nwith fluctuations in fish stocks by producing answers to  such  questions as : Do detection systems \nallow  Defra to pinpoint the  issues of  compliance that relate to those particular stocks that are  \nunder current threat? Are new tools needed to detect and enforce in relation to threatened stocks?133 \n(Are new policies regarding such stocks required?). Does the present set of enforcement strategies \nneed to be adjusted in order to prioritise currently threatened stocks?  Can the assessment system \nindicate with precision how well the detection, response development, enforcement, assessment and \nmodification systems are coping with this newly-defined risk to stocks?  Is the regulator able to \nmodify its processes in order to deal with the new risks to its achieving its objectives? \n \nConclusions \n \nLooking at how a really responsive regulation approach might be applied to fisheries or other areas of \nDefra regulation  serves to  illustrate  the potential contribution of such a perspective. First, it is clear \nhow disaggregating an aspect of the regulatory function (enforcement) into all of its different \ncomponents shows  regulatory enforcement to involve  more than deciding whether to apply a risk-\nbased or responsive regulation approach, or calculating how rapidly to escalate up an enforcement \npyramid.  Prior issues are detection (including the establishing of objectives) and response \ndevelopment.  Fisheries is not unique in raising very serious problems of detection and response \ndevelopment, and the really responsive regulation approach emphasises how problems on one front (for \n                                                 \n132 For Defra efforts to analyse needs for change following the NAO review see Review of Marine Fisheries. \n133 The NAO noted the view of fishing concerns  that Defra\u2019s data on fish stocks were generally a year out of date and \nadrift of fishing experience at sea \u2013 NAO Report, p.19.  \n 41 \ninstance detection134) can impact quite dramatically on the other tasks ( such as response development \nand assessment) that comprise regulatory enforcement.  \n \nAdopting a really responsive viewpoint also stresses the importance of dealing with attitudinal settings \nand  institutional environment, not least the organisational infrastructure of the regulatory regime.  In \nmany regulated areas the multiplicity of regulatory responsibilities stands in the way of effective \nassessment and modification process.   A good deal may be achievable in such areas by clarifying \ninstitutional frameworks and lines of regulatory responsibility \u2013 if necessary across state, quasi-\nregulatory and corporate boundaries.  To argue this is not to reject the message of smart regulation \u2013 \nthat mixes of instruments and institutions may provide best regulatory systems \u2013 it is to propose that \nunproductive fragmentations should be avoided.  \n \n The really responsive regulation perspective also shows how important it is to take on board the \nways in which the logics of different regulatory mechanisms not only interact but tend to do so in \ndistinct ways according to the particular regulatory enforcement task being undertaken.135 Really \nresponsive regulation requires regulation to be amenable to the use of ranges of tools for different \npurposes and according to different regulatory logics (e.g. to punish or for restorative or \nrehabilitative reasons).  It thus avoids the \u2018single axis\u2019 difficulty and draws attention to the \nchallenge of operating through coherent regulatory logics \u2013 ways of combining controls that are \nlocated within culturally or organisationally variant modes of relationship. \n \nAs for performance sensitivity, the really responsive regulation approach demands that we ask \nwhether there is such sensitivity across the five enforcement tasks of: detection; response \ndevelopment, enforcement; assessment and modification. In the case of fisheries, this framework \nexposed a number of limitations and challenges \u2013 not least due to the absence of clear output \nobjectives for the regime136 and the resultant lack of a framework for performance measurement.  \n(Assessments of enforcement  and response tools were similarly undermined by lack of knowledge \nconcerning the effectiveness of the detection system.137 ) A really responsive regulation approach \n                                                 \n134 Issues of detection may be especially acute in fisheries but we contend that these are challenges likely to be \nencountered to a greater or lesser degree in most regulated domains. \n135 For example, the impact of rule design on behaviour and on enforcement strategies: see Baldwin, op. cit. (1995); D. \nMcBarnet and C. Whelan, \u2018The Elusive Spirit of the Law: Formalism and the Spirit of Legal Control\u2019 (1991) 54 \nModern Law Review 848; M.W. Nelson, \u2018Behavioural Evidence on the Effects of Principles- and Rules-Based \nStandards\u2019 (2003) 17 (1) American Accounting Association 91. \n136 Notably measures that show how measured activities are impacting on overall output or outcome objectives - see \nNAO Report, p. 39. \n137 The NAO\u2019s 2003 report on fisheries drew attention to Defra\u2019s problems in measuring performance regarding \ndetection and enforcement. Similarly the European Commission carried out a review of Member State control and \n 42 \nstresses the role of  performance sensitivity in  preventing the  regulator  from being locked into any \ngiven enforcement strategy  or into an emphasis on enforcement rather than the redesign of the \nindustry or the broad control regime. Such an approach brings the need to cope with change to the \nfore. \n \nReally responsive regulation is thus an holistic approach which, in the enforcement context, attends \nboth enforcement in individual instances and the nature of the overall enforcement and regulatory \nstrategy.  It involves constantly challenging the shape of the current regime and thinking \u2018outside the \nenvelope\u2019 of the existing enforcement approach. It offers high levels of transparency insofar as it \nprovides a framework for assessing different enforcement tools and strategies as well as interactions \nbetween these. That framework also provides a means of contributing to coherency of \u2018regulatory logic\u2019 \nso that strategies for dealing with certain tasks do not cut across or contradict those used in relation to \nothers. The really responsive regulation approach, moreover, emphasises the need to deal with networks \nand \u2018decentred\u2019 regulatory regimes in which regulatory functions are carried out by a wide range of \ninstitutional types and instruments.  In doing so, however,  it poses the difficult question of how really \nresponsive regulation can be developed in such polycentric regulatory regimes, including those where \nthe roles of policy making, information gathering and enforcement are distributed between a number of \ndifferent organisations, particularly where they cross different jurisdictional boundaries.   \n \nReally responsive regulation thus provides not so much a set of ready answers to difficult regulatory \nissues as a reframing of the regulatory endeavour. The approach it offers reveals a set of challenges that \nmay appear daunting. This raises the question whether this is an approach that demands a level of \nanalysis too far \u2013 whether it can be operationalised in the usual regulatory context. \n \nThe price of failing to adopt a really responsive approach, however, may be huge. If regulatory \nenforcers do not deal with the issues of detection, response development, enforcement, and assessment \nthey will operate blindly and in a manner that is locked into a static conception of the regulatory \nchallenges that they face. If they fail to address needs for modification they will fail to make the \nadjustments that they must effect if they are to overcome the new hurdles that they will inevitably \nconfront.  \n \nA  worry about really responsive regulation may be that it is too eclectic. With regard to enforcement, \nfor instance, it tells us that there are seven or so potential approaches to choose from and that each has  \n                                                                                                                                                                  \nmonitoring regimes in the fisheries sector in 2001. See also European Commission, Final Report on the Monitoring of \nthe Implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy COM (2001) 526. \n 43 \nstrengths and weaknesses - really responsive regulation does not, however, offer its own line and \nindicate whether risk-based systems are to be preferred to responsive or random or other systems.  \n \nThe answer to this point is twofold.  First, it is the case that the respective strengths and weaknesses of \nthe  major  approaches to enforcement will vary according to context \u2013 it is horses (and mixes of \nequines) for courses. What really responsive regulation does do is to go beyond the general \nprescriptions of \u2018craft\u2019 approaches (e.g. \u201cdevelop an intervention plan\u201d) so as to offer a framework for \nevaluating the role of different such approaches and different combinations of approach or regulatory \nlogic. Thus, by applying a really responsive regulation perspective to the five core tasks of enforcement \nit is possible to identify such matters as: the weaknesses of risk-based regulation regarding the tasks of \ndetection, response development and modification; the strengths of random approaches for detection \nand the weakness of responsive regulation in relation to responses and tools. This framework approach \nis not so much an exercise in random eclecticism as a means of coordinating a number of the crucial \nmessages from the most influential current theories of regulatory enforcement. It provides a systematic \nbasis for developing optimal responses to the various key tasks involved in regulating.  \n \nThe second respect in which really responsive regulation  offers  an advance is by  providing a \nframework that, as noted , goes beyond refining ways to apply the  given regulatory  strategy that is \nencountered in a particular domain. It demands ongoing consideration of the case for reassessing and \nredesigning the overall regulatory strategy \u2013 for examining, for instance, whether to abandon command \nand control methods in favour of taxation or trading regimes. \n \nRegulation is really responsive when it knows its regulatees and its institutional environments, when it \nis capable of deploying different and new regulatory logics coherently, when it is performance sensitive \nand when it grasps what its shifting challenges are. As regulators across the world have to operate \nwithin more complex networks of control and have to face up to increasing rates of change, the case for \nreally responsive regulation can only be expected to grow.  \n"}
