Atmospheric radiative forcing\nA commonly used metric to compare the contributions that different factors make\nto climate change is global mean radiative forcing, DQ (Wm\u22122). Radiative forcing\ncorresponds to the change in net radiation entering the atmosphere [1]. Increases\n*Author for correspondence (chg@ceh.ac.uk).\nOne contribution of 17 to a Discussion Meeting Issue \u2018Greenhouse gases in the Earth system:\nsetting the agenda to 2030\u2019.\nThis journal is \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society2026\n on April 18, 2011rsta.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from \nClimate forcing and ecosystem services 2027\nin greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) produce a positive radiative\nforcing, which warms the planet, whereas increases in reflective sulphate aerosols\nresult in a negative value, and therefore a cooling. Humankind is known to be\nchanging the concentration of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, methane (CH4)\nand nitrous oxide (N2O). At the same time, anthropogenic activities have also\nmodified the atmospheric loading of microscopic \u2018aerosol\u2019 particles.\nIndividual radiative forcings may be combined to give an overall value for DQ,\nto which the climate system will respond. Global temperature change DT (K)\nadjusts to this combined radiative forcing, and if DQ is positive then \u2018global\nwarming\u2019 occurs. Given sufficient time at a fixed forcing change, the Earth\nsystem will approach a new thermal equilibrium satisfying DQ = lDT . Here,\nl (Wm\u22122 K\u22121) determines the change in radiative forcing required to produce\n1K of warming. Climate scientists often consider the related inversely linked\nequilibrium temperature sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, DT2\u00d7 (K).\nAt present there remains major uncertainty in the value of DT2\u00d7 (e.g. [2]),\nalthough the uncertainty in radiative forcing for greenhouse gases is generally\nmuch smaller [1].\nThe additive nature of radiative forcings to give a single, time-varying DQ(t)\ncan provide policymakers with significant manoeuvrability. A particular pathway\nin DQ(t) may be recommended to avoid an expected level of dangerous climate\nchange, but the precise composition of changing greenhouse gas concentrations\nis free to be determined. Given the different sources of greenhouse gases, it\nmay be decided to take a more aggressive stance on reducing CO2 emissions\nto allow for larger increases in atmospheric CH4 and N2O\u2014or vice versa.\nAnthropogenic CO2 emissions are largely due to the burning of fossil fuels and\ndeforestation, whereas the largest contributions to CH4 and N2O increases are\nassociated with agriculture. The balance can also take account of changes in\nlevels of atmospheric ozone (O3) concentrations or aerosols as important clean\nair policies are implemented. Reduction in cooling aerosols will actually require\nmore aggressive reductions in atmospheric greenhouse gases as sulphate aerosols\nare believed to have masked the full extent of current global warming (e.g. [3,4]).\n2. Impacts of different atmospheric constituents on ecosystem services\nRecent research shows that different radiative forcing agents have markedly\ncontrasting physiological effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Hence for ecosystem\nservices, the dimensionality of the climate change problem may not reduce\nsimply to pathways in the single quantity DQ(t). We analyse these differences\nthrough changes to four different atmospheric constituents, all of which are\nexpected to alter markedly through the twenty-first century. First, increases in\nCO2 will influence vegetation not just through climate change but also by \u2018CO2\nfertilization\u2019 of photosynthesis (e.g. [5]). Second, increases in other atmospheric\ngreenhouse gases (such as CH4 or N2O) will affect terrestrial ecosystems only\nthrough climate change\u2014it is believed that there is no significant physiological\nresponse of vegetation to changes in surface concentrations of these gases. (CH4\nemissions can have an indirect physiological effect by O3 formation, but this\nis small and can be neglected here as tropospheric O3 chemistry is mostly\nlimited by nitrogen oxide (NOx). N2O is inert in the troposphere and so has no\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2011)\n on April 18, 2011rsta.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from \n2028 C. Huntingford et al.\nindirect effect.) Third, we consider raised levels of near-surface O3 concentrations,\nwhich are known to damage vegetation and reduce the ability to photosynthesize\n[6\u20138]. Besides this direct effect, O3 is also a greenhouse gas. Fourth, changed\nconcentrations of atmospheric aerosols alter levels of surface photosynthetically\nactive radiation (PAR) and its partitioning into direct and diffuse radiation [9].\nThis influences ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP), and in a slightly\nsurprising way; it has been demonstrated that the increased levels of atmospheric\naerosols since pre-industrial periods have actually enhanced photosynthesis,\nprimarily owing to vegetation canopy interactions with higher levels of diffuse\nlight [10]. Increasing aerosol levels also have a climatological influence on the\nland surface, although in this case through an overall cooling effect.\nWe characterize physiological and climate responses for these four atmospheric\nconstituents, in each case for concentration changes that would lead to a\nradiative forcing of DQ = +1Wm\u22122. In this idealized experiment, the effect\nof these prescribed changes on global warming is, therefore, equal according\nto the radiative forcing equivalence paradigm. To place this in context, the\npre-industrial to present forcing for CO2 is estimated to be 1.66Wm\u22122, other\nlong-lived greenhouse gases (which include CH4 and N2O) to be 0.98Wm\u22122,\ntropospheric O3 to be 0.35Wm\u22122 and the direct effect of aerosols to be around\n\u22120.5Wm\u22122 [11]. To estimate the ecosystem responses, we use the Joint UK Land\nEnvironment Simulator (JULES) land surface model, a modelling system suitable\nfor prediction at large spatial scales. The JULES model has two components.\nThe first calculates heat, water and carbon fluxes [12,13]. This has recently been\nextended to include a multi-layer canopy description as needed to capture the\nPAR responses recently identified [14]. The second component (called TRIFFID\u2014\nTop-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics)\npredicts global vegetation distributions and associated carbon content. Five plant\nfunctional type (PFT) classes are represented: broadleaf trees, needleleaf trees,\nshrubs and C3 and C4 grasses. The model determines fractional coverage of each\nPFT based on the available resources using Lotka\u2013Volterra equations.\nWe run the JULES model for all land regions (excluding Antarctica) on a\n2.5\u25e6 latitude by 3.75\u25e6 longitude grid, and, unless otherwise stated, we use the\nsame methodology as in the previous published studies [6,10,15]. An initial control\nsimulation is forced with gridded mean climatological data representative of the\nperiod 1980\u20131999 [16]. Direct and diffuse short-wave fluxes were reconstructed\nusing aerosol distributions simulated by the Hadley Centre Global Environment\nModel, HadGEM2-A, and radiative transfer calculations [10]. The effect of the\nmajor volcanic eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (Mexico) and Mount Pinatubo (The\nPhilippines) are excluded from the means for 1980\u20131999 (i.e. periods 1982\u20131984\nand 1991\u20131993, respectively). Atmospheric CO2 concentration is set to the 1980\u2013\n1999 average (354 ppm). Fields of surface O3 are prescribed to be representative\nof year 1990. For each land point, gridbox averaged values of NPP (kgCm\u22122 yr\u22121)\nand runoff (R) (m3 m\u22122 yr\u22121) are calculated. Global values of these quantities for\nthis control simulation (in units of GtCyr\u22121 and 1012 m3 yr\u22121, respectively) are\nplotted in black in figure 1a,b. Global values of soil plus vegetation carbon are\ngiven as the single number (1613GtC) in table 1.\nIn order to compare the impacts of different radiative forcing agents we make\nsimulations of the equilibrium state of the vegetation and soil for each of the\nphysiological or climate drivers outlined above (note this differs from [15], which\nPhil.

The green cross shows the physiological-only response to\nraised levels of CO2 (the climate is assumed to be the same as the control simulation). Similarly,\nthe physiological-only responses to increased O3 and decreased sulphates are given by the blue\nand orange crosses, respectively. For comparison, the red cross represents the impact of climate\nchange only (i.e. no physiological response) on NPP and R through altered surface meteorological\nconditions associated with +1Wm\u22122 of radiative forcing. Hence this plot allows comparison\nbetween the impact of individual physiological responses and climate change per se. (b) The\ncombined influence of both physiological and climate change effects on global NPP and R for\n+1Wm\u22122 radiative forcing, which provides information on the overall implications of changing\nparticular atmospheric constituents. We achieve this simply by adding the calculated climate\nchange perturbation to the physiological responses in (a). Hence the difference between the red\nand black crosses in (a) is added to each of the three physiological effects, also as given in (a), to\nobtain their new overall position in (b). The red cross in (b) represents greenhouse gases, such as\nCH4 and N2O, which have no known direct physiological effects on vegetation, but which, when\nchanged, do alter the atmospheric radiative balance. Hence the red cross in (b) is in the identical\nposition to that of (a).\nused fixed vegetation cover). Land-use changes are excluded so as to focus on\nchanges due to the different atmospheric pollutants. A rise in atmospheric CO2\nconcentration from 354 to 426 ppm corresponds to an increase in radiative forcing\nof +1Wm\u22122, and so, to capture the associated physiological effects, a new\nsimulation is made for this higher concentration. All other model components,\nincluding climate forcing conditions, are as in the control simulation. Global\nNPP and R for this new simulation are given by the green cross in figure 1a.\nThe increased CO2 concentration generates both higher NPP and runoff (owing to\nreduced transpiration) in this model. This is broadly consistent with experimental\nevidence of CO2 fertilization of photosynthesis [17] and CO2-induced stomatal\nclosure [18]. In common with other global vegetation models [5], JULES produces\nan increase in water use efficiency under elevated CO2, which implies an\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc.

Models differ in the balance between these manifestations of increasing\nwater-use efficiency, in large part because they disagree on the extent to which\nincreasing leaf area index offsets the reduced water use by each leaf [19].\nHowever, the almost universal agreement that plant water-use efficiency increases\nunder elevated CO2\u2014and in most models this is associated with increased\nrunoff [5]\u2014implies a high degree of confidence that CO2 fits uniquely into the\nhigher NPP and higher R quadrant of figure 1a. This is despite the remaining\nuncertainties in the exact magnitude of CO2 effects on photosynthesis and\nstomatal conductance.\nFrom table 1, this new equilibrium simulation with atmospheric CO2 now at\n426 ppm also corresponds to an increase of 12.8 per cent in terrestrial carbon\ncontent when compared with the control state. Geographical maps of these\nchanges for NPP and R are given in figures 2a and 3a, respectively. There is\nan increase in NPP for most regions, whereas the runoff map is patchier, with\na few regions experiencing reduced runoff where increases in water-use efficiency\nper leaf are counteracted by increases in leaf area index.\nThe climate change simulation describes the impact of altered surface climate\non terrestrial ecosystems due to an increase in global mean radiative forcing of\n+1Wm\u22122. For greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O, to which ecosystems have\nno direct physiological response, this represents the only changes to impact on\nthem. To calculate the altered surface climate conditions, we employ a pattern-\nscaling approach (calibrated against the HadCM3 climate model) in which the\nlocal changes in surface climate are scaled proportional to the mean warming over\nland [20]. Climate change alone is predicted to reduce both global NPP and R,\nas shown by the red cross in figure 1a, and terrestrial carbon content is predicted\nto decrease by over 7 per cent (table 1). Geographical differences are given in\nfigures 2b and 3b. Climate change is predicted to lead to major geographical\nchanges in NPP, with particular reductions in the Amazon rainforest. Decreases\nin NPP are also predicted in mid-Northern latitudes, but further north global\nwarming increases NPP as a result of an extended growing season and the\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc.

From figure 3b, climate change alone\nreduces runoff in many regions because evaporative demand increases more\nrapidly than precipitation. This increase in evaporative demand is particularly\nlarge over Amazonia, which therefore dominates the global signal in runoff\nreduction for this climate change simulation.\nWe can estimate the combined effect of each change by simply adding the\nclimate impact (the difference between the black and red crosses in figure 1a) to\nthe direct physiological impact. The new values are given in figure 1b. Hence for\nour prescribed increase in CO2 concentration, we estimate an overall increase in\nNPP as the positive impacts of CO2 fertilization outweigh the negative impacts\nof climate change. However, in these particular simulations we still see a slight\nreduction in runoff owing to the overall (climate plus physiological) effect of the\nCO2 increase.\nThe O3 simulation is achieved by forcing the gridded JULES model with\nprescribed surface fields of O3. We use monthly mean surface O3 concentrations\nfor year 1990 (as in the control simulation) and year 1860, both as simulated\nby the Met Office\u2019s Lagrangian tropospheric chemistry model STOCHEM [6,21].\nIt is estimated that the difference in radiative forcing associated with surface\nO3 changes between these two dates is +0.32Wm\u22122 [22]. Hence to estimate a\nfurther increase in atmospheric O3 concentration consistent with +1Wm\u22122, we\nadd to the year 1990 O3 values that are the difference between the year 1860 and\n1990 fields, multiplied by factor (1.0\/0.32). In all other respects, the simulation\nis identical to that of the control simulation. From figure 1a, such O3 damage\nwould give a significantly lower global NPP, although raised R because the less\nproductive vegetation uses much less water for transpiration. Indeed, we simulate\na 13.2 per cent reduction in leaf stomatal conductance for woody vegetation\nbetween the elevated O3 and present-day control simulation, which is broadly\nconsistent with observed reductions from manipulation experiments [8]. When\ncombined with the associated climate change (blue cross in figure 1b), there is a\nfurther reduction in NPP, and slightly smaller increase in runoff. O3 physiological\ndamage in this simulation corresponds to a 15.4 per cent reduction in terrestrial\ncarbon (table 1). Where O3 concentrations increase there is almost always a\nreduction in NPP (figure 2c) and an increase in R (figure 3c).\nThe physiological influence of changes in atmospheric aerosols is through\nvariation in the amount and quality of the PAR to which plants are exposed.\nHigher levels of aerosols generally reduce total surface PAR, but they also cause\nmore scattering of that radiation, thereby increasing the ratio of diffuse to\ntotal radiation (called diffuse fraction, Fd). These two effects are found to be\ncompeting: lower light levels will generally reduce NPP at any particular leaf\nsurface, but this is counteracted and even overtaken by a higher diffuse fraction,\nwhich acts to distribute the PAR more evenly through the canopy [10]. In the\ncontrol simulation, average distributions of tropospheric aerosols (sulphate, soot,\nbiomass-burning, mineral dust, sea-salt and biogenic) and known cloud cover for\n1980\u20131999 (again ignoring major volcano years and 2 years after) are used within\nradiative transfer look-up tables to obtain surface PAR fluxes. This follows the\nmethod described in Mercado et al. [10]. The direct effect of scattering aerosols,\nsuch as sulphate aerosols, is to exert a negative radiative forcing by scattering\nincoming solar radiation back to space. Hence a positive value for DQ implies a\nreduction in the amount of sulphate aerosols.\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2011)\n on April 18, 2011rsta.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from \n2032 C.

Hence to simulate a positive aerosol radiative forcing, we\nreplace the distribution of sulphate aerosol for the period 1980\u20131999 (as used\nin the control) with those believed to be appropriate for year 1901. This provides\na forcing of +0.26Wm\u22122 at the top of the atmosphere. Surface PAR fluxes\nare then recomputed with this revised distribution of sulphate aerosol, and\na new global equilibrium simulation is undertaken. Differences in ecosystem\nresponse from the control simulation are then normalized by the forcing of\n+0.26Wm\u22122 (i.e. we multiply differences by 1.0\/0.26) to allow comparison\nwith the other climate agents on the basis of an equivalent radiative forcing\nof +1Wm\u22122. However, this may neglect some nonlinearity in the response\nof ecosystems to changes in direct and diffuse radiation. Cloud cover and\nconcentrations of the other tropospheric aerosol species remain unchanged at\ntheir 1980\u20131999 average. In agreement with the analysis of Mercado et al. [10],\na major reduction in atmospheric aerosols yields a significant decrease in NPP\n(figure 1, orange cross), and from table 1 there is also a 4 per cent decrease\nin total terrestrial carbon content. Global mean runoff is modelled to increase,\nas the less productive vegetation uses less water for transpiration. Short-lived\naerosols are far less well mixed in the atmosphere than long-lived greenhouse\ngases, and as a result diffuse radiation effects are most obvious near to the\nindustrial areas that dominate the sulphur emissions (figures 2d and 3d). When\nthe physiological impacts are combined with climate change, the orange cross in\nfigure 1b implies that aerosol reduction will overall cause an actual decrease in\nboth NPP and R. However, the precise values here should be treated carefully, as\nthe climate change associated with changes in aerosols will be more regionalized\nthan that of our climate change simulation associated with well-mixed\ngreenhouse gases.\n3. Discussion\nClimate change caused by changes in atmospheric constituents is usually\nexpressed in terms of radiative forcing. Advice to policymakers working to avoid\nlevels of unwelcome or even dangerous climate change is often presented in terms\nof upper limits to such forcing. This is sometimes translated into \u2018equivalent\nCO2 concentrations\u2019, with the implication that there is significant freedom in\nconstituent changes as long as total radiative forcing stays within prescribed\nlimits. However, some of the greatest impacts on humankind will occur through\nchanges in food and water availability [23] rather than through climate change\nper se. NPP and runoff levels are indicators of such availability, and a set\nof recent research papers have shown that the direct physiological effects of\nchanging different atmospheric constituents on these ecosystem services is large\nand varied. This implies that consideration should be given to going beyond\nthe single \u2018radiative equivalence\u2019 metric when addressing the overall impacts of\ndifferent atmospheric pollutants. For equivalent radiative forcing (of +1Wm\u22122),\nwe calculate changes in NPP and R for (i) increases in CO2, (ii) increases in\ngreenhouse gases with no physiological effects and hence only climate impacts\nsuch as CH4 or N2O, (iii) increases in ground-level O3, and (iv) decreases in\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2011)\n on April 18, 2011rsta.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from \n2034 C. Huntingford et al.\nsulphate aerosols. The global overall effects (physiological plus climate) are\npresented in figure 1b for both NPP and R, and most importantly are found\nto have different signs.\nThe fertilization effect of higher CO2 levels, which is not present for other\ngreenhouse gases, offsets the detrimental influence of imposed climate change.\nThis suggests that a greater emphasis should be placed on also dealing with non-\nCO2 causes of global warming. On the basis of our calculations, the difference\nbetween the overall impact of a +1Wm\u22122 increase in atmospheric CO2 as\ncompared with a +1Wm\u22122 increase in the concentration of a physiologically\ninactive atmospheric constituent such as CH4 amounts to about 5 per cent\nhigher values of global runoff and 10 per cent higher values of NPP. Another\ninterpretation of figure 1 is that higher levels of atmospheric sulphates may\nactually be beneficial in the context of NPP and R, owing to the higher\ndiffuse fraction aiding photosynthesis along with an overall cooling effect (i.e.\noffsetting global warming). This also has implications for the geoengineering\noption being considered, using deliberate aerosol increases to counteract climate\nchange. However, such gains from raised NPP and R values should be balanced\nagainst the uncertain but potentially very damaging effects of ocean acidification\nassociated with higher CO2 on coral reefs, shell-forming marine organisms [24]\nand fish populations [25].\nWhile trusting the qualitative features of our analysis, there do remain\nimportant uncertainties in the size of direct physiological effects of different\natmospheric constituents. This is particularly true of CO2 fertilization [17,26]\nand this represents a critical limitation for the comparison of different mitigation\noptions. The magnitude of this effect may be altered in mid- and high-latitude\necosystems by plant nitrogen availability, and possibly by phosphorus cycling in\ntropical ecosystems [27,28], although these processes are not yet fully understood.\nThe nitrogen cycle is only now beginning to be depicted in general circulation\nmodelling (GCM) land surface models suitable for global-scale simulations [29].\nFurther studies are required to determine the overall impact of alternative aerosol\ntypes. We have analysed the response to sulphate aerosols because of their large\nconcentrations and ubiquitous nature. However, emerging understanding of how\nchanged levels of black carbon and biomass-burning affect the atmosphere will\nallow the implications of these aerosols also to be incorporated in a similar\nframework. Our study has also only considered equilibrium climate states for\nchanges to NPP and runoff. In a transient climate, the precise magnitude of\nclimate versus physiological effects may differ.\nThis study argues for metrics to compare different atmospheric pollutants\nthat go beyond radiative forcing and global warming. Here, we have considered\nimpacts on the vital terrestrial ecosystem services related to the availability of\nfood and water, but we accept that there will be other alternative metrics to\nradiative forcing that could provide insights into the overall impacts of different\nclimate mitigation options. Key among these are metrics related to air quality and\nhuman health [30], and the impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystem\nservices [25].\nAlthough the largest anthropogenic change to radiative forcing, and thus\ncontribution to climate change, has been through increases in atmospheric CO2\nconcentration, without such metrics there is the risk that action on climate\nchange mitigation will become overly concerned with reducing CO2 emissions.\nPhil.
