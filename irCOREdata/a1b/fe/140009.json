This paper shows how charges based upon\nconsumption could facilitate trading amongst metered consumers, and provide\nincentives to non-metered customers to switch to a metered tariff. To develop a\nhousehold domestic water trading scheme various environmental trading schemes\nwere examined, including European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and\nTradable Energy Quotas (TEQs). The derived scheme for water incentivises domestic\nconsumers to trade and reduce their use of the resource. Although a degree of trading\nwould be possible on an occasional basis with un-metered properties (by the\nsubstitution of appliances with water conserving models), and conventionally metered\nproperties (based upon sustained reductions in consumption, but on an annual basis),\nfrequent full trading would only be possible if smart water meters were installed. We\nconclude that, whilst water trading schemes are feasible, they present a number of\nchallenges. However, due to the availability of a number of existing potential\nelements, implementation, at least on a regional basis, could be achievable relatively\nquickly. Once an initial scheme is running it could be refined and expanded to other\nregions, and nationally or internationally, if appropriate.\n1 Water conservation in perspective\nSince 2003 it has been a legal requirement for the Government of England and Wales\nto encourage water conservation and report on progress every three years (Section 81\nof the Water Act 20031). \u2018To regulate in a way that provides incentives \u2026 for\ncustomers in England and Wales\u2019, is also part of the Office of water services\u2019 (Ofwat)\n3mission statement. Additionally, one of the requirements of the EU Water framework\nDirective2 is for Member States to \u2018ensure by 2010 that water-pricing policies provide\nadequate incentives to use water resources efficiently and to recover the true costs of\nwater services in an equitable manner\u2019. So, there is a significant and timely political\nand environmental need to develop appropriate water conservation incentives for\nusers not only in the UK but elsewhere.\nThe cost of water is critical to the success of any incentive scheme3. For charges to be\nrelated to consumption, the volume used must be measured, but currently only 26 %\nof UK homes are metered4. Various studies to investigate the costs and benefits of\ninstalling meters throughout the UK have concluded that metering costs are high in\nrelation to the benefits. Apart from the purchase cost, there are the installation,\nmaintenance, reading and verification costs, and the potential social and health costs\nparticularly for poor families. The Policy Studies Institute5 have demonstrated the\nvalue of different tariff structures but with all there would be winners and losers.\nAlso, water charges in the UK are some of the lowest in Europe6. So there is little\nincentive for UK householders to request a meter and be billed accordingly. However,\nin regions such as the South East of England, water stress (withdrawals \/ availability)\nis classified as severe, comparable with the situation in much of Southern Europe.\nSimply installing a meter will not necessarily produce a lifestyle change resulting in\nlong\u2013term water savings. For example, this quote from the Government\u2019s Energy\nReview could equally apply to domestic water \u2013 \u2018The main obstacles to the take up of\nenergy efficiency are lack of information about costs and benefits, absence of\nappropriate incentives, and lack of motivation among customer.\u20197 . So if metering will\n4not motivate water efficiency, what alternatives or complimentary approaches could\nbe applied in the UK and elsewhere?\nBrown8 has suggested that the principles of carbon trading schemes could be applied\nto the water sector. For example, she considers the case of a developer who retrofits\nwater saving appliances into housing association properties with payment being in the\nform of in-kind water allowances. The result would be water savings in older houses\nwith commensurate water saving appliances installed in new build houses as part of\nthe planning requirements. Although this innovative approach addresses the issue of\nwater conservation infrastructure in buildings, it does not influence user habits. As an\nelement of a more comprehensive scheme, the approach proposed by Brown could be\nvaluable.\nTraditionally, people are encouraged to reduce their consumption of a product, or\ngeneration of pollution, in exchange for reduced costs. However, trading schemes\ntend to incentivise the participants more than the usual restrictive conservation\nmeasures as each participant is allocated a limit or provided with a specific allowance.\nThis creates awareness of the value of a commodity by generating, or enhancing, the\ncommodity\u2019s market. Users with extravagant consumption will have to reduce or\npurchase additional allowances. Those with low consumption will have excess\nallowances that can be sold and traded.\nCurrently, the most comprehensive trading scheme in the world is the European\nUnion\u2019s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). This scheme is multinational and\naddresses the major emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a way that encourages them\n5to change processes and practices to reduce carbon emissions9. So, could the EU ETS\nbe translated for use in a water context? A critical examination of the theory, structure\nand experiences of trading schemes is used below as a precursor to the development\nof a domestic water trading scheme (DWTS) that could provide incentives for\nhouseholders to save water and invest in water meters.\n2 Background to environmental trading schemes\nEnvironmental trading schemes were first suggested in the 1960s10,11, first\nimplemented in the USA and have since grown in size and coverage. Although\ntrading schemes are simple in concept they tend to be complex in practice to ensure\ntheir operability and fairness. However, trading schemes are very good at creating, or\ndeveloping, markets and making the participants aware of the cost of the commodity\ninvolved; few, if any, other mechanisms are as effective12 .\nIn outline, environmental trading schemes are typically initiated when a limit is\nimposed, or agreed, on a particular commodity, eg water, greenhouse gas emissions or\nfood. The limit is normally applied over a time period, eg 5-20 years, and may be\nsubdivided into reporting periods. Users are constrained by legal requirements, or\nvoluntary agreements, as appropriate. If the commodity limit, often called a \u2018cap\u2019, is\nset below existing use, users are encouraged to cut consumption. The cap is divided\ninto appropriate allowances for the individual participants. The allowances may be\ndistributed by an authority using a declared methodology (formula) or by auction.\n6Each participant must determine if they have sufficient commodity for their needs.\nThose with a deficit can make changes to reduce consumption or must buy more\ncommodity. At reconciliation, each user surrenders the appropriate number of\ncommodity rights, or allowances, for that period, or they may be subject to a punitive\nfine. Hence each user can chose the lowest cost way of obtaining the match between\nallowance and use. The trade of allowances may take place throughout the scheme, or\nat specific times depending upon the design and administration method. The incentive\nto trade is normally to minimise costs, but it could also be to minimise environmental\nimpacts. To date, the perfect trading scheme has not been produced, they all have\nflaws. However, the evolving nature of the schemes and the economic theories and\nmodels that support them should help schemes improve and gain acceptability.\nA fundamental issue with environmental trading schemes is the ownership of the\ncommodity concerned. With water, it can be argued that as rain falls on everyone;\nwater should be owned by all and is a right, not a commodity. This argument ignores\nthe fact that most water is not suitable for drinking and that the work and equipment\ninvolved in treating and distributing water needs to be paid for. However, as most\nwater is not drunk, there are arguments that water is over-treated and people should\nnot have to pay for a quality they do not require13.\nWhilst many people will be willing to pay an increased price, as water is a necessity\nits price has to be carefully considered. Although the cost of water is low compared to\nother utilities, there are people who have difficulty paying for it. Any proposed\nincrease needs to be related to the customers\u2019 abilities to pay14,15.\n7One common fundamental problem with environmental trading schemes appears to be\nan almost complete lack of trading16. Another problem with such economic incentives\nis the inadequate consideration of externalities for the particular market17. Trading\nschemes generally take many years to develop and need regular reviews to ensure\nfairness and achievement of the aims. While the concept is simple and\nstraightforward, and most participants want winners and losers in order to stimulate\ntrade, in practice no one wants to be a loser.\n3 Methodology\nAs noted above, the use of a trading scheme for domestically supplied water has been\nsuggested by Brown8 as a concept at developer and housing association level. To\ndetermine whether a wider domestic water trading scheme (DWTS) is indeed feasible,\na literature review was undertaken evaluating existing trading schemes; assessing\ntheir suitability for adaptation to the water sector. Collated information was then\nstructured to identify key details of candidate trading schemes (see Table 1).\nTable 1a.

Many of the issues of competitiveness, monitoring,\ntransparency and allocation methodology have been resolved and the lessons learnt\ncould be applied to a DWTS. However, as EU ETS only covers major industrial\nemitters, it would need considerable modification to deal with households.\nA personal form of trading scheme that has been proposed in the Carbon emission\nfield is known as DTQs (Domestic Tradable Quotas) or TEQs (Tradable Energy\nQuotas)18. Such schemes, based upon the global ownership principal, provide every\nhuman with an equal allocation of credits in a carbon account. Every transaction\nwould include an exchange of carbon credits for the associated carbon cost, by using a\nform of credit, or identity, card account. Such a scheme would require large\ninvestments and commitment on a national, if not international, scale19 but the\nconcept has received Government backing as a long term possibility20. A DWTS\ncould form a bridge between the established large scale upstream schemes, such as\nEU ETS, and the much more downstream schemes like the proposed TEQs. The links\nand parallels between the key elements of EU ETS, TEQs21 and a hypothetical DWTS\nare set out in Table 2.\n12\nTable 2 - Comparison of trading schemes Table 5\nEU ETS Hypothetical DWTS TEQs\nAllocation method by\ngrandfathering\nAllocation by meter records Allocation by entitlement\nAllocation method by\nbenchmark\nAllocation by water audit Allocation by auction\nSector classifications Consumption profiles Individual or organization\nNational cap National or regional or catchment\ncap\nCarbon budget\nNew Entrant Reserve (NER) New development reserve \u2013 if\nrequired\nAuction\nClosure issues Demolition of property \/ change of\nuse\nRetirement of quotas\nReconciliation Reconciliation (annually) Budget monitoring (constant)\nTrading of allowances Trading of allowances Trading of quotas\nLinks with JI and CDM Schemes undertaken by\ncommunities could have benefits\ndistributed to the affected\nhouseholds and others in the\ncommunity.

Most schemes rely upon metering to determine use\nof the controlled substance (eg fuel, water, etc), however it has to be accepted that in\nthe UK, for the foreseeable future, the majority of users will not be metered. Although\na national scheme would be appropriate in some countries, the ownership of water\ncompanies and the large number of water catchment areas in the UK suggests that a\nregional catchment based scheme would be the ideal and this fits in with the\nprinciples of the Water Framework Directive2. The outline structure of a proposed\nscheme is shown in Figure 1. The key elements are expanded upon in the following\nparagraphs.\nFigure 1 to go hereabouts\n4.2 Water Audit\nThe simplest way of determining household water consumption would be to use water\nmeters. However, meters22 have only been fitted in all new houses in the UK since\n1989, so alternative means are needed in the vast majority of the housing stock. One\nway of dealing with the lack of metering is to utilise water audits to determine\nbaselines, changes, and investigate complaints. In a similar way to tax returns,\nhouseholders could be required to complete an assessment that would provide the\nbasis for determining their water use rating and hence their water bill. Audits could be\n14\nconducted annually and submitted with the annual electoral roll reviews. The data\nobtained through the audit needs to be processed to determine consumption and any\nindicative trends.\nAnother approach is to build upon the method used in the various established\nenvironmental rating schemes such as BREEAM (BRE environmental assessment\nmethod) and LEED (leadership in energy and environmental design). These use\nsimple spreadsheets and average values for benchmarks, but can be restrictive in their\nsuitability for non-standard situations.\nAlternatively, a simple survey could be conducted by a trained professional auditor or\nby the householder with guidance. An example of a user-conducted audit with good\nguidance is the Canadian \u2018Wise Water Use Guide\u201923 .\nSome aspects of an audit may already be held on databases that could be accessed by\nappropriate bodies. Such databases include: the electoral roll, planning records, recent\ncensus, tax return, credit rating and market intelligence databases. Although it may be\nuseful to collect as much information as possible, this must be balanced against cost,\ntime, civil liberties, data protection and freedom of information issues.\n4.3 Water charge determination\nFrom the audited returns, annual consumption volumes can be calculated for each\nhousehold. It will be more justifiable than the current rateable value based charge.\nMetered installations\u2019 consumption will be determined from the meter readings, and\nadjusted where necessary using information obtained from the audit, especially when\n15\na meter has not been installed for the full accounting period. The benefit of\nconserving water could be translated into reduced treatment costs resulting in lower\nsupply charges. However, any additional administration costs due to running the\nscheme can be wholly or partially passed on.\nIn addition, the appropriate externalities will be calculated and fed in. Although\nindividual external influences may be small, their consolidated effect needs to be\nincorporated into the pricing of water. The ExternE project has been carried out for\nover 15 years into externalities24. It has produced a methodology for energy that is\napplicable to water due to the study\u2019s comprehensive methodology.\n4.4 Un-metered trading (rebate)\nThe overall objective of the scheme is that householders will be able to moderate their\nconsumption and save water. Un-metered dwellings will have a restricted annual\nscheme of rebates and audits. If the householder has no interest in trading they may\ncontinue to pay the projected charge.\nUn-metered households cannot make financial savings by changing habits, but by\ninstalling water conserving appliances and then applying for a new water audit, which\nwill revise the chargeable volume, until another audit or the property is sold. A similar\nUK scheme is currently in operation for commercial properties using the Enhanced\nCapital Allowance (ECA) scheme that enables firms to recover all of the capital\nexpenditure against taxable profits25. Within the ECA there are currently three\nschemes; one covers water conserving products.\n16\nSuch a scheme could provide un-metered users with the additional incentive to\nrequest a meter to enter fully into the trading scheme and save more than any cost\nassociated with a meter. Although metered installations would not need to obtain\n\u2018approved\u2019 appliances to enable trading, promotion of such appliances to the un-\nmetered installations could encourage metered customers to regularly review their\nown appliances.\n4.5 Metered trading\nMetered customers will have the greatest opportunities for savings and to benefit from\ntrading as they will be able to trade any monthly surplus throughout the year. The\nadministrators of the scheme have a dual incentive to make trading work for the\nmetered householders; a) encourage further take-up of meters, and b) collect more\naccurate data on water use for better water management26.\nAs demonstrated above, the building blocks needed to instigate a household domestic\nwater trading scheme in the UK are generally available and have been tried and\ntested. Table 3 sets out some of the established components that could be used to put\ntogether a pilot scheme. And Figure 2 suggests a detailed structure for such a scheme.\nTable 3- Building blocks of a domestic water trading schemee 6\nBasic structure (Fig 1) Proposed DWTS Existing \u2018blocks\u2019 that\ncould be utilised\nAudit Allocation determined from\nmeter records\nExisting water records\n17\nAllocation determined from water\naudit\nBREEAM, \/ Hamilton A guide to\nWise Water Use\nConsumption profiles Demographic database profiles\n(as used by DCLG for planning)\nDemolition of property \/ change\nof use\nPlanning guidance and policy\nDetermination of relevant\nexternalities and their impact on\nthe water price\nResults of the ExternE project by\nthe European Commission and\nthe USA Department of Energy\nNew development reserve \u2013 if\nrequired\nPlanning guidance and policy\nDetermination of charge\nReconciliation (annual event) EA or SEPA, RDAs or Water UK\nNational or regional or catchment\ncap\nEU ETS processTrading\nTrading of allowances Carbon market traders\nRebate Un-metered users appliance\nrebate scheme\nEnhanced Capital Allowance\nscheme and the Water\nTechnology Lists\nIncentives for metering Full trading UK ETS\nPossible future links Community based projects Planning process, Housing\nCorporation, other Member States\nFigure 2 to go hereabouts\n5 Example scenario\nTo illustrate how trading could be implemented amongst households a worked\nexample is provided (see Table 4). It compares four different households: (A) a single\n18\nworking person household with a metered supply, (B) a four person household\ncontaining two adults (one of whom is in full-time employment) and two children\nwith a metered supply, (C) a retired couple with a metered supply, and (D) an\nunmetered version of household B.\nEach household is assumed to possess a six litre WC, a 120 litre bath a 12 l\/min\nshower, a 10 l\/min kitchen tap, a 5 l\/min basin tap, a 50 litre \/ cycle washing machine\nand 20 litre \/ cycle dishwasher. By applying appropriate usage frequencies the weekly\nconsumption figures for households A-D are 1.2, 3.5, 2.4, and 3.5 m3\/week\nrespectively.\nFor the purposes of this illustration, the following tariffs have been applied in the first\nyear:\nA1 A flat rate of \u00a3340 a year\nB1 A flat metered rate of \u00a32.50\/m3\nC1 Initial rate of \u00a31.0 per m3 for up to 20m3, second rate of \u00a32.0 per m3 over 20m3\nD1 Initial rate of \u00a31.0 per m3 for up to 20m3, second rate of \u00a32.0 per m3 from 20\nto 50m3, third rate of \u00a33.0 from 50 to 100m3, forth rate of \u00a35.0 over 100m3\nAfter a base year to determine their allocation, the households adopt different\napproaches to the imposed allocations. The single man gives up using the bath, the\nfamily invest in replacement shower head and low flow basin taps, but the retired\ncouple change nothing. As the allocation is always less than the \u2018business as usual\u2019\nsituation trading should be required.\n19\nThe first two households obtain a surplus of water units (say m3), but the third has a\ndeficit. Although the retired couple could ignore the deficit and not trade, they would\nbe hit with a fine for exceeding their allocation. The fine is high enough to encourage\ntrading at a lower cost.\nTable 4.

The tariff structures will impact the overall costs to the consumers,\nbut careful structuring of the metered customers can take place to ensure that financial\nincentives continue to drive efficient water use. Once, most customers have had\n20\nmeters installed, the need for trading, in the format proposed, will reduce. However,\nwithout water trading, it might be difficult to encourage such a take-up of meters.\n6 Discussion and Conclusions\nThe proposed DWTS is not perfect; it has weaknesses, but also considerable\nstrengths. When compared to other trading schemes, the main conceptual weakness is\nthe established market for water. Unlike carbon, where a new market was needed,\npeople are already paying for water. The main practical weakness is that it is, as a\nwhole, unproven. A gateway may be needed, as in DTQs, to enable trading with other\nmarkets such as personal carbon and EU ETS.\nQuestions such as: \u2018who should be responsible for cap setting and organising\ntrading?\u2019, and \u2018what are the operating overheads?\u2019, do not have clear answers. The\nallocator of responsibilities would normally be the Regulator, on a national basis, or a\nregional authority on a regional basis. Although the cap could be seasonally varied, it\nis far simpler to have an annual cap to enable planning to take place. As with all\ncharges, there will be appeal procedures put in place. If the customer did not agree\nwith their allocation set within the region\u2019s cap, they could appeal, but any increase in\nan individual\u2019s allocation would need to be taken from other household\u2019s allocations\nas the regional, or national, cap must not be exceeded. Water companies could operate\na scheme, but Ofwat or CCfW could also oversee or operate one. Other possible\noperators include: EA, local councils, or GLC in London. However, an independent\nrespected operator could be crucial to the success of a scheme by instilling confidence\nin investors and minimising time inconsistency problems27.\n21\nThe main strength is that the scheme provides incentives to all existing customers and\nsuch a scheme is needed to fulfil National and European legal requirements. Another\nimportant feature is that it can be basin or catchment limited. This would enable pilot\nschemes to be run with relatively low levels of commitment. Also, the basic structure\ncan be used to develop different schemes to provide appropriate incentives in a\nlocality and link with other issues such as planning and inter-catchment trading.\nSustainability is not just a concern of industry, but also the individual. To date,\nalthough individual carbon trading schemes have been proposed, it is only industrial\nschemes (such as EU ETS) that have been set-up and run. Hence, the main models for\nwater trading, or management of any other individually consumed resource, are\ncurrently mainly industrially based. The candidate trading schemes show that\nextensive involvement of all stakeholders is needed, if they are to succeed and the\ndifferent stakeholders have focussed viewpoints. Economists and environmentalists\ntend to dismiss political issues and advocate the implementation of pure theory, issues\nof competitiveness and security of supply are not considered significant enough to\ndeviate from the fundamental principles. However, Governments tend to complicate\nschemes; they address issues of fairness and competitiveness whilst also considering\nthe economic and political impacts of environmental issues. Such conflicts of interests\nand outlook would occur in a DWTS, but with some different players. Within the\nstakeholders for a DWTS will be the key gatekeepers that can enable such a scheme\nto be developed28.\n22\nThe scheme needs to be financially viable and cost effective for both the consumers\nand the suppliers. Water Companies need to maintain profitability and realise\nmeasurably reduced consumption. Also, the Regulator needs to be convinced that the\nscheme is beneficial, fair to both consumers and water companies, legal, and that no\nother better alternative is available.\nAs with any scheme there will be winners and losers, but potentially, everyone could\nwin. Water companies could minimise expenditure on expanding supplies and meet\ntheir legal obligations. Customers could reduce their consumption and hence their\nbills. However, there could be degrees of winning. Metered customers with smart\nmeters have the potential to win the most \u2013 if they can continually reduce their\nconsumption. However, the same customers could lose significantly if they increase\ntheir consumption. So, the power to be a winner or loser is in the hands of the\ncustomer.\nFor the water companies, they may win whatever the customer does. Profligate\nconsumers will contribute more through higher charges; economising consumers will\nrequire less supply. Even if more people economise than expected, the Water\nCompany could, in theory \u2013 if permitted by the Regulator, just increase prices and\ncharges to maintain an appropriate return. Regulators could cap charges to impose\nfinancial penalties on companies that have not met previous targets and requirements.\nRegulators could also set the allowance limits for householders, the trading unit\nvalues and the conditions.\n23\nThere are legislative needs for a mechanism to incentivise domestic water users in the\nUK to save water and the DWTS scheme outlined above could help enable the UK\nachieve the 2015 target for the Water Framework Directive. Due to the lack of\nuniversal metering a scheme is required that does not rely upon meters, but will\nencourage un-metered householders to become metered. DWTS provides incentives\nand paves the way for a more justifiable water charging structure. The building blocks\nneeded to instigate a DWTS in the UK are generally available.\nAcknowledgment and note\nThanks to the Construction Sector Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry for\ntheir sponsorship.
