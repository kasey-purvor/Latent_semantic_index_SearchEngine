At the same\ntime, it became increasingly clear that the type, frequency,\nduration and intensity of PA are major determinants of its\nhealth impact. Accordingly, recommendations to guide\nq The Authors 2003*Corresponding author: Email alfred.ruetten@sport.uni-erlangen.de\nPublic Health Nutrition: 6(4), 371\u2013376 DOI: 10.1079\/PHN2002450\nthe PA of the population from a public health perspective\nhave been developed4 and the specific concept of \u2018health-\nenhancing PA\u2019 was created5. Most recently, international\nefforts have started to concentrate on development of the\nright instruments to measure \u2018health-enhancing PA\u20196.\nNevertheless, to date there is a great diversity of health\nindicators in general and of PA measurements applied in\nnational monitoring activities within the European Union\n(EU). A recent inventory of PA measures used in the eight\ncountries participating in the EUPASS project, i.e. Belgium,\nFinland, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain\nand the UK, revealed that no single key dimension of PA\n(i.e. type, frequency, duration, intensity) is covered by all\nof those countries to date. Accordingly, the focus of\nquestions varies considerably between countries even\nwhen related to the same dimension. For example, in one\nsurvey, frequency questions very much relate to sporting\nactivities while in others the frequency of stair climbing or\nhousework PA is asked for. Also, in most cases, different\nreference periods are used to report the frequency of PA\n(e.g. last week, usual week, past 12 months). Moreover,\nmany types of measurement scales (e.g. nominal, ordinal,\ninterval scales) have been applied in the surveys\nexamined6.\nThe International Physical Activity Questionnaire\n(IPAQ) was developed to overcome this type of diversity.\nNevertheless, as the international consensus group who\ndeveloped this new instrument had to make many\ndecisions regarding the concept of PA, such as its key\ndimensions, reference period and scales, the IPAQ itself\npresents a certain perspective of PA investigation. First of\nall, this perspective includes the investigation of various\ncontexts of PA, i.e. PA at work, for transportation, around\nthe home and during leisure time. In particular, the short\n(last 7 days) telephone interview version of the IPAQ\n(IPAQ-S7T), which has been especially recommended for\ninternational monitoring purposes, does not differ\nbetween the different contexts but integrates aspects\nfrom all of them, e.g. when asking for the duration of\nmoderate PA (min week21). Second, the IPAQ especially\nfocuses on an investigation of total time of PA and caloric\nexpenditure (MET min21), as these PA indicators were\nassociated with reduced cardiovascular disease incidence\nand mortality in previous studies and therefore have been\napplied in public health recommendations for health-\nenhancing PA4. Third, the IPAQ-S7T measures differ\nbetween four levels of activity\/inactivity, i.e. vigorous PA,\nmoderate PA, walking and sitting.\nThe main purpose of the present paper is to explore\nsome methodological implications of the perspective of PA\ninvestigation covered by the IPAQ instrument. Therefore\nwe present first results of an international survey in eight\nEU countries using the IPAQ-S7T as well as different PA\nmeasures applied in these countries to date. To investigate\nthe specificity of the IPAQ perspective, a comparison is\nmade between IPAQ-S7T outcomes and the results of both\nnational measures applied in EUPASS and other European\nstudies.\nMethods\nA time series survey based on computer-aided telephone\ninterviewing (CATI) was carried out in eight European\ncountries over a six-month period. The study provided for\nabout 100 interviews per month in each country (i.e.,600\nper country)6.\nThe EUPASS questionnaire included both indicators of\nPA behaviour from relevant national health surveys and\nindicators of PA behaviour developed by the IPAQ group6.\nA major task of the IPAQ measurement is to sum up the\nsingle indicators to an overall indicator of PA-related\nenergy expenditure (MET min21). Ainsworth et al. 7 have\nrecommended energy expenditure estimates assigned to\neach of the self-reported PA categories (vigorous,\nmoderate, walking and sitting). Regarding the IPAQ-S7T\nversion, the following MET estimates have been applied:\nvigorous PA \u00bc 8 METs, moderate PA \u00bc 4 METs, walking\non average \u00bc 3.3 METs. For calculating the overall MET\nPA, each activity category was multiplied with its special\nMET estimate value. Finally, the overall MET PA of the\ndifferent categories were summed up to the Sum MET PA.\nDescriptive statistic measures (mean, standard deviation\n(SD), median) and correlation analysis (Spearman\u2019s\ncorrelation coefficients) were applied to describe and\ncompare PA patterns found in the eight EU countries by\nusing different PA measurements.\nIn addition, as one major goal of developing an\ninternational comparable PA measurement is to facilitate\ninternational comparisons, the ranking of the eight\nparticipating EU countries according to the outcome of\nthe IPAQ-S7T measures in the present study was\ncompared with outcomes of other European studies.\nResults\nResponse rates ranged from 54.5% for Finland and 50.5%\nfor Germany to 29.1% for France and 25.5% for the UK (for\ndetails of sample description, see Rznewicki et al. 8). As\nthe actual response rates from some countries were rather\nlow, the results of the following analyses have to be\ninterpreted with caution. However, for the explorative\npurposes of the study, the current data appeared to be\nsufficient.\nTable 1 shows the mean and SD for each level of\nPA covered by the IPAQ-S7T. The highest mean for\ndays per week of vigorous PA is reported for Germany\n(,3 days) followed by Finland (,2.5 days) and Belgium\n(,2 days); lowest means are reported for Spain and\nItaly (,1 day). Regarding minutes of vigorous PA the\nranking is quite similar. Germany (500.31 min week21)\nshows the highest mean followed by Finland (435.49 min\nA Ru\u00a8tten et al.372\nweek21). The lowest mean is reported for Italy (84.63 min\nweek21).\nTurning to days of moderate PA, Germany and The\nNetherlands show the highest means (,3.5 days week21).\nThe lowest mean is shown for Spain (2.04 days week21).\nRegarding minutes of moderate PA, the Germans are\nmoderately active for 526.82 min week21 on average,\nfollowed by the Finns (405.63 min week21) and the\nBelgians (388.99 min week21); Italians show the lowest\nmean of moderate activity (191.73 min week21).\nFor days of walking, the Spanish mean is the highest\n(,6.5 days week21). The Dutch are walking for ,6 days\nweek21, followed by the Germans. UK participants walk\nless on average (5.18 days week21). For minutes of\nwalking the ranking is quite different. Belgians walk on\naverage 880.27 min week21 followed by the Germans and\nthe Dutch. Least walking duration is reported for the UK.\nSpanish participants show the highest mean in the\nsitting category. They are sitting on average for 2540 min\nduring the week and at the weekend. The lowest mean for\nsitting is reported for Belgium (,1740 min). It is\ninteresting to note that Italians, generally the least\nphysically active group in this study, show the second\nlowest mean for sitting as well.\nTable 2 shows means, SDs and medians for Sum MET\nPA. The highest mean is reported for Germany (8534\nMETs) followed by Belgium (,7100 METs) and Finland\n(,7000 METs). The lowest mean is shown for Italy\n(2617.33 METs) followed at a distance by the UK. Turning\nto the medians, 50% of all respondents reported 2970\nMETs and more per week. The highest median is shown\nfor the Germans (5070 METs) followed by the Finnish; the\nlowest is reported for Italy followed by the UK.\nDue to the diversity of current PA measurements applied\nin the different EU countries, any comparison of results\nprovided by the different instruments appears to be\nextremely difficult if not impossible. Moreover, although\nthe IPAQ was developed to overcome current divergen-\ncies in PA measurement, the instrument itself represents a\nnew approach that is again different from other measures;\nthus making it difficult to compare IPAQ results with\nothers as well.\nRegarding the national indicators used in the EUPASS\nstudy, only very few items showed enough similarity with\nthe IPAQ. Finally, two questions, one from the German\nhealth survey and one from the Dutch, were selected for\nthe purpose of such a comparison. In the German case, the\nquestion focuses on time on average spent per day on\nvigorous, moderate and light PA and on sitting; in the\nDutch case, frequency and duration of PA within the last 14\ndays are asked for.\nFor comparison, means (reported for the different IPAQ-\nS7T PA categories as well as for the German and the Dutch\nnational items) have been recalculated (min day21).\nTable 3 presents results of the comparison between\nIPAQ-S7T and the German national questionnaire andT\na\nb\nle\n1\nIP\nA\nQ\n-S\n7\nT\n:\nm\ne\na\nn\ns\n(S\nD\ns\n)\no\nf\nv\nig\no\nro\nu\ns\na\nn\nd\nm\no\nd\ne\nra\nte\nP\nA\n,\nw\na\nlk\nin\ng\na\nn\nd\ns\nit\nti\nn\ng\n(d\na\ny\ns\n,\nm\nin\nu\nte\ns\np\ne\nr\nw\ne\ne\nk\n)\nfo\nr\ne\nig\nh\nt\nc\no\nu\nn\ntr\nie\ns\nin\nth\ne\nE\nu\nro\np\ne\na\nn\nU\nn\nio\nn\nV\na\nri\na\nb\nle\nA\nll\nn\na\nti\no\nn\ns\n(n\n\u00bc\n4\n9\n9\n5\n)\nB\ne\nlg\niu\nm\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n1\n1\n)\nF\nin\nla\nn\nd\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n0\n3\n)\nF\nra\nn\nc\ne\n(n\n\u00bc\n5\n9\n9\n)\nG\ne\nrm\na\nn\ny\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n5\n3\n)\nIt\na\nly\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n0\n0\n)\nT\nh\ne\nN\ne\nth\ne\nrl\na\nn\nd\ns\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n0\n6\n)\nS\np\na\nin\n(n\n\u00bc\n6\n0\n0\n)\nU\nn\nit\ne\nd\nK\nin\ng\nd\no\nm\n(n\n\u00bc\n7\n2\n3\n)\nD\na\ny\ns\nv\nig\no\nro\nu\ns\nP\nA\n1\n.7\n9\n(2\n.2\n2\n)\n1\n.9\n6\n(2\n.3\n1\n)\n2\n.4\n6\n(2\n.2\n7\n)\n1\n.8\n8\n(2\n.3\n5\n)\n2\n.8\n9\n(2\n.4\n7\n)\n1\n.1\n5\n(1\n.9\n1\n)\n1\n.4\n2\n(2\n.0\n5\n)\n1\n.0\n8\n(1\n.6\n5\n)\n1\n.4\n4\n(1\n.9\n6\n)\nS\nu\nm\nv\nig\no\nro\nu\ns\nP\nA\n(m\nin\n)\n2\n8\n1\n.7\n3\n(6\n3\n1\n.1\n5\n)\n3\n3\n3\n.1\n2\n(6\n7\n1\n.2\n0\n)\n4\n3\n5\n.4\n9\n(6\n8\n9\n.3\n5\n)\n3\n0\n8\n.4\n5\n(6\n8\n1\n.6\n6\n)\n5\n0\n0\n.3\n1\n(7\n9\n2\n.6\n9\n)\n8\n4\n.6\n3\n(2\n6\n5\n.7\n1\n)\n2\n3\n3\n.8\n1\n(5\n9\n9\n.2\n9\n)\n1\n9\n7\n.3\n1\n(5\n4\n9\n.9\n9\n)\n1\n5\n8\n.2\n5\n(3\n5\n4\n.5\n6\n)\nD\na\ny\ns\nm\no\nd\ne\nra\nte\nP\nA\n2\n.7\n6\n(2\n.6\n1\n)\n2\n.8\n2\n(2\n.6\n2\n)\n2\n.8\n7\n(2\n.4\n0\n)\n2\n.2\n2\n(2\n.5\n5\n)\n3\n.7\n2\n(2\n.6\n6\n)\n2\n.6\n7\n(2\n.5\n0\n)\n3\n.5\n7\n(2\n.8\n6\n)\n2\n.0\n4\n(2\n.2\n3\n)\n2\n.1\n0\n(2\n.4\n4\n)\nS\nu\nm\nm\no\nd\ne\nra\nte\nP\nA\n(m\nin\n)\n3\n1\n8\n.7\n4\n(1\n1\n5\n.4\n9\n)\n3\n8\n8\n.9\n9\n(6\n5\n8\n.0\n4\n)\n4\n0\n5\n.6\n3\n(5\n8\n7\n.5\n1\n)\n3\n0\n7\n.4\n3\n(6\n4\n5\n.8\n4\n)\n5\n2\n6\n.8\n2\n(7\n4\n8\n.9\n3\n)\n1\n9\n1\n.7\n3\n(3\n9\n2\n.9\n2\n)\n3\n1\n0\n.5\n0\n(5\n4\n4\n.2\n2\n)\n2\n1\n0\n.9\n5\n(4\n5\n2\n.9\n2\n)\n2\n0\n3\n.0\n4\n(4\n4\n2\n.2\n2\n)\nD\na\ny\ns\nw\na\nlk\nin\ng\nfo\nr\na\nt\nle\na\nst\n1\n0\nm\nin\n5\n.7\n2\n(1\n.9\n8\n)\n5\n.6\n7\n(2\n.0\n2\n)\n5\n.4\n6\n(1\n.9\n8\n)\n5\n.7\n7\n(2\n.0\n4\n)\n5\n.9\n0\n(1\n.9\n0\n)\n5\n.2\n9\n(2\n.1\n1\n)\n5\n.9\n9\n(1\n.9\n2\n)\n6\n.4\n5\n(1\n.3\n3\n)\n5\n.1\n8\n(2\n.1\n2\n)\nS\nu\nm\nw\na\nlk\nin\ng\n(m\nin\n)\n6\n0\n0\n.3\n1\n(8\n7\n8\n.3\n2\n)\n8\n8\n0\n.2\n7\n(1\n1\n8\n0\n.5\n8\n)\n5\n8\n8\n.6\n7\n(7\n8\n6\n.2\n7\n)\n7\n9\n4\n.8\n0\n(1\n0\n9\n8\n.6\n3\n)\n6\n9\n8\n.3\n6\n(9\n8\n6\n.6\n7\n)\n3\n5\n5\n.8\n0\n(5\n9\n4\n.0\n1\n)\n6\n9\n7\n.3\n9\n(8\n4\n6\n.8\n9\n)\n4\n8\n2\n.9\n4\n(6\n1\n3\n.7\n9\n)\n3\n2\n2\n.7\n1\n(5\n3\n1\n.6\n8\n)\nS\nu\nm\ns\nit\nti\nn\ng\n(m\nin\n)\n2\n0\n3\n3\n.1\n1\n(1\n1\n1\n5\n.6\n7\n)\n1\n7\n4\n1\n.7\n0\n(1\n0\n7\n7\n.6\n7\n)\n1\n8\n5\n2\n.3\n5\n(1\n0\n1\n5\n.7\n8\n)\n1\n8\n8\n3\n.4\n0\n(1\n0\n6\n5\n.7\n2\n)\n2\n1\n2\n7\n.1\n5\n(1\n2\n4\n9\n.3\n0\n)\n1\n7\n6\n3\n.5\n8\n(9\n7\n7\n.1\n7\n)\n2\n2\n3\n7\n.4\n3\n(1\n0\n2\n3\n.4\n4\n)\n2\n5\n3\n9\n.6\n8\n(1\n0\n6\n9\n.5\n9\n)\n2\n0\n9\n7\n.3\n0\n(1\n1\n7\n1\n.9\n3\n)\nIP\nA\nQ\n\u2013\nIn\nte\nrn\na\nti\no\nn\na\nl\nP\nh\ny\ns\nic\na\nl\nA\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\nQ\nu\ne\ns\nti\no\nn\nn\na\nir\ne\n;\nIP\nA\nQ\n-S\n7\nT\n\u2013\ns\nh\no\nrt\n(l\na\ns\nt\n7\nd\na\ny\ns\n)\nte\nle\np\nh\no\nn\ne\nin\nte\nrv\nie\nw\nIP\nA\nQ\n;\nS\nD\n\u2013\ns\nta\nn\nd\na\nrd\nd\ne\nv\nia\nti\no\nn\n;\nP\nA\n\u2013\np\nh\ny\ns\nic\na\nl\na\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n.\nResults of EUPASS time series survey 373\nbetween IPAQ-S7T and the Dutch national questionnaire.\nThe scores for the different PA categories provided by both\nthe German national item and IPAQ-S7T items in Germany\nare rather high e.g. compared with the Dutch result. For\nexample, the median for minutes of moderate PA in the\nIPAQ-S7T questions in Germany is 30 min day21 and the\nmedian of vigorous PA is 26 min day21. Considering\nthe German national PA indicator, the median for\nmoderate PA is 150 min day21 and even for vigorous PA\nis up to 60 min day21 (Table 3).\nMoreover, it should be emphasised that the lowest mean\nand median for min day21 are shown for the Dutch\nnational indicator (Table 3), i.e. for the most general\nquestion (average of PA for the past 14 days). On the other\nhand, the highest mean and median are reported for the\nGerman national indicator, which at the same time is the\nmost differentiated instrument, e.g. asking for a complete\nreport of 24 hours divided into the four categories of\nactivity\/inactivity mentioned before plus sleeping\/resting.\nThe comparability between PA measurements used in\nnational health monitoring of EU countries to date and the\nIPAQ-S7T has already been discussed in another EUPASS\npaper6. However, in the present context it appears to be\nespecially interesting to investigate how far items that\nfocus on quite similar issues (e.g. measuring duration of\nPA at different levels) correlate. The decision to use\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation (r) was based on the fact that\nthe data were not normally distributed. For Germany, only\none correlation between the moderate PA item of the\nnational questionnaire and the vigorous PA item of the\nIPAQ-S7T was rather low and not significant \u00f0r \u00bc 0:097;\nP , 0:10\u00de: All other coefficients were very low and not\nsignificant (r \u00bc 20:046 to 0.035). In the Dutch case no\nsignificant correlation between the national item and the\nIPAQ-S7T was found as well \u00f0r \u00bc 0:021\u00de:\nTable 4 presents results of a comparison between the\nnations\u2019 ranking from three studies, i.e. EUPASS, MAREPS\n(a European study on health policy and health behaviour\nincluding PA9) and the pan-EU study on consumer\nattitudes which also included questions on PA10.\nTable 4 shows the ranking of PA participation rates for\neach nation. Finland comes first in all three studies\nfollowed by The Netherlands in the MAREPS and pan-EU\nstudy, but followed by Germany in the EUPASS study.\nThe lowest rank is presented by Spain in the EUPASS and\nMAREPS studies and by Belgium in the pan-EU study.\nRegarding duration of PA, Germany has the highest rank\nin the EUPASS study but is only fourth in the pan-EU study.\nBelgium comes second in the EUPASS and eighth in the\npan-EU study.\nTurning to vigorous PA, in the EUPASS study German\nrespondents show higher scores than the Finns and the\nDutch, while, in contrast, findings from the MAREPS study\nranked Belgium before the Spanish and the Dutch.\nFor moderate PA, Germany is again ranked highest in\nthe EUPASS study followed by the Finns and the Belgians.\nIn the MAREPS study the results are quite different: the\nFinns come first followed by the Germans and the\nBelgians. Spain presents low ranks in both studies.\nTurning to light PA, the EUPASS study shows the highest\nscores for Belgium followed by France and Germany. In\nMAREPS the Finns comes first followed by the Dutch and\nTable 2 IPAQ-S7T: means, SDs and medians of caloric expenditure (MET) per week for eight countries in the European Union\nSum MET PA\nAll nations\n(n \u00bc 4995)\nBelgium\n(n \u00bc 611)\nFinland\n(n \u00bc 603)\nFrance\n(n \u00bc 599)\nGermany\n(n \u00bc 653)\nItaly\n(n \u00bc 600)\nThe Netherlands\n(n \u00bc 606)\nSpain\n(n \u00bc 600)\nUnited\nKingdom\n(n \u00bc 723)\nMean\n(SD)\n5605.94\n(7332.54)\n7105.80\n(8475.00)\n6999.52\n(7610.44)\n6686.05\n(8376.14)\n8534.21\n(9024.51)\n2617.33\n(4363.71)\n5543.95\n(6931.69)\n4175.91\n(5665.65)\n3238.31\n(4524.17)\nMedian 2970.00 4021.00 4212.00 3826.00 5070.00 1173.00 3384.75 2359.50 1653.00\nIPAQ \u2013 International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ-S7T \u2013 short (last 7 days) telephone interview IPAQ; SD \u2013 standard deviation; PA \u2013 physical\nactivity.\nTable 3 Means, SDs and medians of vigorous and moderate PA, walking and sitting for selected variables of\nGerman and Dutch national PA questionnaires and IPAQ-S7T (min day21)\nNational questionnaire IPAQ-S7T\nVariable Mean SD Median Mean SD Median\nGerman\nVigorous PA (min day21) 124.13 180.15 60.00 71.47 113.24 25.71\nModerate PA (min day21) 170.28 125.46 150.00 75.26 107.00 30.00\nLight PA\/walking (IPAQ) (min day21) 268.18 143.41 240.00 99.77 140.95 45.00\nDutch\nPA (min day21) 23.00 47.97 4.29 25.30 26.63 17.76\nSD \u2013 standard deviation; PA \u2013 physical activity; IPAQ \u2013 International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ-S7T \u2013 short\n(last 7 days) telephone interview IPAQ.\nA Ru\u00a8tten et al.374\nthe Germans. Low ranks are shown for Spain in both\nstudies.\nDiscussion\nThe means and medians for vigorous PA, moderate PA and\nwalking provided by the IPAQ-S7T in the present study are\nrather high compared with current public health\nrecommendations. For example, the mean for moderate\nPA for all nations is more than 300 min week21 and the\nmedian for calories expenditure is about 3000 kcal\nweek21. With regard to international public health\nrecommendations, which e.g. aim at increasing PA in the\ngeneral population up to 150\u2013180 min week21 or about\n1000\u20131400 kcal week21, most participants of the present\nstudy would already meet these recommendations. Other\nstudies that used the IPAQ for reliability and validity\nstudies seem to confirm this result. Thus, previous\nconcepts and recommendations, which had a primary\nfocus on leisure-time PA and sport, should be recon-\nsidered against the background of the new integrated\napproach of IPAQ which also includes various other forms\nof PA such as PA for transportation and work around the\nhome.\nThe German national question about how much time on\naverage is spent on PA per day (including a 24-hour\nframework to fill in) provided even higher scores than the\nIPAQ-S7T tested in the same questionnaire. This may\nindicate again that a still more differentiated approach\nconsidering all daily activities under this perspective may\nincrease the overall scores of duration of PA and caloric\nexpenditures related to it. Correspondingly, the more\ngeneral Dutch question on average PA in the past 14 days\nprovide for the lowest scores in this comparison.\nAnother issue that arises in this context refers to the PA\ncategories covered by the IPAQ-S7T, i.e. vigorous and\nmoderate PA, walking and sitting. In particular, the Italian\nresults, which in a comparison of the eight EU countries\nwere almost the lowest in all PA categories and the same\ntime showed the second lowest scores for sitting, may\nindicate that Italians participants assign significantly less of\ntheir daily activities to the different categories offered by\nthe IPAQ. Further analysis will investigate if Italian\nrespondents just would score higher in an additional\ncategory such as \u2018sleeping, resting\u2019 or if specific cultural\ndifferences in interpreting the questions are involved here.\nConclusions\nOf course, the limitations of the present study have to be\nconsidered before interpreting the results. Nevertheless,\neven if the samples provided for the different EU countries\nare not fully representative for the whole population, they\nare fairly appropriate for exploring the specificity of the\ndifferent PA measurements used in the EUPASS project.\nIn particular, this study helps to understand some\nmethodological implications of the IPAQ instrument. For\nexample, the differences in overall scores for PA, as well as\nin the ranking of nations between the present results using\nIPAQ and other measures and studies, may be related to\nthe methodological concepts of measuring PA behind the\ninstruments. While many extant measurement methods\nfocus mainly on leisure-time PA, the IPAQ explicitly\nintegrates PA at work, around the home and for\ntransportation. Among other things, this methodological\nshift may explain some of the differences found in this\nanalysis. At least two major research questions are\nhighlighted by the present results. First, further investi-\ngation is needed to find out if the range of PA-related\ncategories provided by the IPAQ (from vigorous PA to\nsitting) is fully appropriate to measure all relevant daily\nactivities. The Italian results (lowest in PA and in sitting)\nmay refer to specific cultural differences in the perception\nof PA and\/or the IPAQ, which should be considered by\nelaborating an internationally comparable PA indicator.\nSecond, further analysis should investigate the public\nhealth implications of mixing up different contexts of PA\n(e.g. work, leisure-time, transportation) in the IPAQ short\nversion. For example, the same amount of calories\nexpenditure of PA at the workplace and of leisure-time\nPA may have significantly different health effects. Thus, an\nadditional question on context as used in the present study\nmay be helpful to complement the recommended short\nIPAQ instrument.\nTable 4 Comparison of three European studies: ranking of nations for PA participation, duration and different levels of intensity (vigorous,\nmoderate, light) (\u2013 indicates that question or nation is not included in the study)\nBelgium Finland France Germany Italy\nThe Nether-\nlands Spain\nUnited\nKingdom\nVariable E M C E M C E M C E M C E M C E M C E M C E M C\nParticipation 7 4 8 1 1 1 5 \u2013 5 2 3 4 4 \u2013 7 3 2 2 8 5 6 6 \u2013 3\nDuration 2 \u2013 8 3 \u2013 1 4 \u2013 5 1 \u2013 4 8 \u2013 7 5 \u2013 2 6 \u2013 6 7 \u2013 3\nVigorous PA 3 1 \u2013 2 5 \u2013 4 \u2013 \u2013 1 4 \u2013 8 \u2013 \u2013 5 3 \u2013 6 2 \u2013 7 \u2013 \u2013\nModerate PA 3 5 \u2013 2 1 \u2013 4 \u2013 \u2013 1 2 \u2013 8 \u2013 \u2013 4 3 \u2013 7 4 \u2013 7 \u2013 \u2013\nLight PA 1 4 \u2013 5 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 \u2013 3 3 \u2013 7 \u2013 \u2013 4 2 \u2013 6 5 \u2013 8 \u2013 \u2013\nPA \u2013 physical activity; E \u2013 European Physical Activity Surveillance System (EUPASS) study (eight countries included); M \u2013 MAREPS study (five EUPASS\ncountries included); C \u2013 European consumer attitudes study (all eight EUPASS countries included).\nResults of EUPASS time series survey 375\nAcknowledgements\nEUPASS was funded by the Health Monitoring Programme\nof the EU (European Commission, Luxembourg, agree-\nment number VS1999\/5133 (99CVF3-502)).
