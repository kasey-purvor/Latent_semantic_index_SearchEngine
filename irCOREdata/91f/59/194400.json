Particularly in Anglo-Saxon capitalism, \nvarious institutional pressures have worked to dissociate management from expertise \nin the managed process. Management of this character can only engage with concrete \nprocesses by modelling them in terms which it can comprehend and with which it can \nengage. The result is a market in management and accounting techniques for \nproducing these simplified representations. Those discussed in this paper consist \nessentially of a reporting framework which is imposed on the expert practitioner, so \nthat the process is redescribed in modelled form. Precisely because the resulting \nmodels are simplified, however, the consequences of managing through them are \ndysfunctional in various ways. \nIn order to show the underlying similarities between apparently unconnected instances \nof this process, the paper discusses some attempts to open up aesthetic design to \nmanagement control before proceeding to the analysis of activity-based cost \nmanagement. \n 2\nIntroduction \nOver the past decade, papers such as Gareth Morgan's 'Accounting as Reality \nConstruction' (1988) and Ruth Hines' 'In Communicating Reality, We Construct \nReality' (1988) seem to have lost much of their critical force. Once it is established \nthat accounting does not mirror some objective reality, little more follows from the \nmere fact that it is socially constructed. Since all knowledges are socially constructed \nin the sense that they are products of human understanding and social acceptance, it \nbecomes uninteresting to say the same of accounting. The interest lies in the questions \nof how, why and with what consequences it is socially constructed. \nIn this paper, I suggest that activity-based cost management (ABCM) is one of a class \nof techniques which has been constructed so as to appeal to a particular market for \nideas. Particularly within Anglo-Saxon capitalism, that market has been conditioned \nby institutional pressures within management education, consultancy and labour \nmarkets which have worked to create a sharp distinction between 'management and \nwhat French and Raven (1959) once called 'expert power'. The result at the level of \nideas is an abstract and generalised conception of management which is detached \nfrom expertise in any particular process and can, in consequence, be applied to any \nand all processes1. At the human level, the result is the creation of a managerial cadre \nwhose stock-in-trade is management-in-general rather than expertise in the processes \nto be managed (see Armstrong, 1986, 1996). For the one to control the other, for \nmanagers of this kind to control a particular process, it is necessary for that process to \nbe constructed in a form which they find comprehensible and amenable to purposive \nintervention. Many of the procedures which are grounded in management knowledge \naim to do exactly this. They are responses to a market for social constructions of \nreality, and ABCM is a response to this market. \nIn order to flesh out these ideas, and to concretise the market for managerial ideas, I \nbegin not with an analysis of ABCM, but with an account of some recent attempts to \nconstruct the design of products (in the aesthetic sense) as a process amenable to \nmanagerial control. These cases indicate that design can only be constructed as a \nprocess transparent to managerial control by editing out the very characteristics which \nmight yield competitive advantage (see Armstrong, 2000, Armstrong and Tomes \n1996). The paper then considers the image of staff activity which underlies the project \nof controlling indirect costs through ABCM (see Armstrong, forthcoming). This \nportrayal too is shown to involve considerable degradation as compared to the self-\nimages of the staff functions concerned. The likely consequences in both cases flow \nfrom management's capacity, as agents of capital, to concretise its own versions of \nreality. Both product design and the staff functions subjected to ABCM can be forced \nto conform to the social constructions demanded by management technique. These \nsocial construction then act as self-fulfilling prophecies in which the degraded image \nbecomes a degraded actuality. \n                                                 \n1 The linguistic isomorphism with Marx's concept of abstract labour, of labour-in-\ngeneral, suggests a stripping-out of mystificatory entangelements with the concrete \nwhich leaves abstract labour confronting abstract management - but the implications \ncannot be pursued here. \n 3\nManagement: Generalised and Abstract \nAcknowledged as the founders of management thought, both Frederick Winslow \nTaylor and Henri Fayol would have been astonished at some of the inclusions and \nomissions in today\u2019s teaching and research on management. Begin with the \nomissions: Importantly Taylor\u2019s \u2018revolution in management\u2019, was also a \u2018revolt of the \nengineer\u2019 (Layton, 1971), a revolt against  \u2018ordinary management\u2019 which, in Taylor\u2019s \nview, had forfeited its claim to authority because it lacked expertise in the productive \nprocess. As with the motive, so with the practice. The re-design of production \nprocesses which lay at the heart of Taylor\u2019s Scientific Management depended heavily \non the expertise of the mechanical engineer, a profession of which Taylor was himself \na distinguished member. For Taylor, then, the competent management of a process \nwas inconceivable without expertise in that process. So it was with Fayol. Although \nthe work translated by Lyndal Urwick as \u2018General and Industrial  Management\u2019 \n(Fayol, 1949) aimed to set out the general principles of efficient administration, it was \nalso an expression of Fayol\u2019s experience as a mining engineer. And although his \nprinciples were subsequently appropriated by Urwick as the knowledge base of a \ndecontextualised managerial knowledge, Fayol himself took it for granted that they \nwould be applied in the light of a thorough knowledge of production processes. \nVery early in the history of management education, it became clear that the pressure \nof educational markets would prise apart this primordial unity of management and \nprocess knowledge. Harvard University\u2019s first venture into management education \nwas a 1908 course on Railroad Management. This included such industry-specific \ntopics as Railroad Operation, Railroad Accounting and Railroad Organisation and \nFinance. The pattern of electives chosen by students, however, quickly revealed a \ndemand for topics of more general application, such as Industrial Organisation, and \nFactory Management (Copeland, 1958: 21 ff.). By 1912, the trend towards generality \nin management courses was decisively under way, driven by factors which remain \noperative today. Courses which promise a generality of application appeal to a \nbroader market than those which are sector-specific. They also promise a wider range \nof career options since the end-qualification is portrayed as portable. The underlying \nassumption - largely tacit at this stage - was that management is always and \neverywhere the same. \nDriven by the logic of competition and predation, meanwhile, capitalism itself was \nchanging. Messily but inexorably, the era of family capitalism was giving way to that \nof entrepreneurialism, and this, in turn was giving way to managerial capitalism \n(Chandler, 1977). In consequence, the range of managerial practice was extending \ninto functions previously reserved for ownership, such as finance, marketing strategy \nand company policy itself. As early as 1911, Harvard had responded by introducing a \ncourse in business policy, 'to develop an approach to business problems from the top \nmanagement point of view.' (Copeland, 1958: 42). By the early 1920s, Harvard\u2019s \ncourses had re- focussed on 'certain broad functions of the business enterprise': \nbusiness policy, business law, statistics, marketing, accounting, money and banking, \ncorporate finance and social factors in business. \nAgain one can discern the not-very-hidden hand of the market. Though the managers \nwho practice the corporate-level functions are few indeed, what student, especially \nwhat student from Harvard, would opt for a course which omits the disciplines of \ncorporate management? To do so would be to declare at the outset the modesty of \none\u2019s ambitions. Driven by these twin tendencies \u2013 the detachment of management \n 4\nfrom expertise in the managed process, and its identification with corporate-level \nfunctions - the modern conception of what counts as management science was already \nemerging. \nAlso in place was its rationale: the doctrine of managerial essentialism which justifies \nboth the decontextualization of the management syllabus and the inclusion of \ncorporate level functions in courses at all levels. Here it is expressed in the 1968 \nedition of a popular management textbook which, together with its successor volume, \nhas now run through ten editions: \n. . . managers perform the same function regardless of their place in the \norganisational structure or the type of enterprise in which they are engaged ... \ngetting things done with or through people. The implications of this principle are \nseveral. In the first place it means that anything significant that is said about the \nfunctions of one manager applies to all managers ... In the second place, the \nprinciple implies that management knowledge and experience are transferable from \ndepartment to department and from enterprise to enterprise. \nKoontz and O'Donnell, 1968, p. 54 \nThe influence of this thinking on what is taught in the name of management has been \nprofound. 'A valid distinction cannot be drawn between the study of management for \none purpose rather than another.' wrote Urwick in the report which introduced the \nUKs first national system of management education (Ministry of Education, 1947, p. \n7). As with the principle, so it was with the practice. The syllabus for Urwick's 1948 \ncourse for 'managing directors and other high executives' delivered under the auspices \nof the Institute of Industrial Administration was virtually identical to that for his \ncourse on Principles of Industrial Administration intended for technical college \nstudents. \nHow, then, do management thinkers account for the very obvious differences in the \nwork of managers at different levels? Beginning with Fayol himself, the tendency has \nbeen to see these as differences of quantity rather than quality. On this view, lower \nlevel managers, do the same things as higher management, but less of them. The \nmatters which occupy the rest of the time of lower level managers, it follows, do not \ncount as management. Here the notion is expressed by the most eminent management \nguru of them all:- \nEvery manager does things which are not managing. He may spend most of his time \non them. A sales manager makes a statistical analysis or placates an important \ncustomer. A foreman repairs a tool or fills in a production report. A manufacturing \nmanager designs a new plant layout or tests new materials. A company president \nworks through the details of a bank loan or negotiates a big contract - or spends \ndreary hours presiding at a dinner in honor of long service employees. All these \nthings belong to a particular function. All are necessary and have to be done well. \nBut they are apart from that work which every manager does whatever his function \nor activity, whatever his rank and position, work which is common to all managers \nand is peculiar to them. \n(Drucker, 1955, p. 343) \nSupervisors need to learn about company strategy, it follows, not just to encourage the \nbelief that their studies might one day get them into a position to practice it, but \nbecause they already do company strategy, albeit in miniaturised form. For these \n 5\ntruths to be universally acknowledged, however, it was necessary to disentangle \nmanagement from its origins in industrial engineering: \nAfter, and even before, Taylor's death, a great many people adopted the profession \nof which he was the first exponent as advisers or counsellors to business \nundertakings that wished to improve their methods of management. Initially, the \nmajority of these professional men described themselves as industrial engineers. \nSince most of then were engineers by training, they were usually employed in the \nmanufacturing function of business and, most frequently, in the metallurgical \nindustries. This was reasonable enough in the early stages. But as the concept of \nmanagement has expanded, such counsellors have dealt with all kinds of business \nproblems for which an engineering training is not necessarily the most appropriate \ndiscipline and for which, in certain cases, some other and different discipline may \nbe mandatory. To continue to describe as industrial engineers firms engaged \nprimarily in introducing psychological concepts into the selection and handling of \npersonnel or statistical refinements into the handling of markets, is an obvious \nmisnomer. The more modern and exact title of management consultant is tending to \nreplace industrial engineer in these fields. . . Management owes an immense debt to \nengineering, but engineering as practised by the industrial engineer is only a part of \nthe over-all work of managing. Engineering as a 'discipline' is concerned with \nphysical forces and physical underlying sciences. Any title which includes the term \nengineering is strictly limited to dealing with things, because engineering \nknowledge does not include people. \n(Urwick, 1963 pp. 1 - 6) \nThe genesis of abstract management, evidently, was bound up with a challenge to the \ncredibility of the engineer in the market for consultancy services. Educational \ninstitutions too, have played their part in shaping and sustaining this view of \nmanagement since their market too has come to depend upon it. It is also presupposed \nand endlessly propagated by the kind of generalised textbook in which the quotations \nfrom Drucker and Koontz and O\u2019Donnell appear (Principles of Management, The \nPractice of Management). At the level of practice, finally, it has become a condition \nof existence of those characteristic figures of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, the peripatetic \nmanagement consultant and the job-hopping senior executive. The credibility of both \nrests on a belief that the fate of companies, corporations and entire economies is \nlargely determined by the quality of a context-independent managerialism (Williams \net al, 1994). It is a belief-system sustained by massive intellectual and institutional \ninterests - which is precisely why academic researchers ought to be prodding it for \nrust-holes. Such is the compartmentalisation of academic life, however, that most of \nthose in a position to do so are themselves \u2018management researchers\u2019, a sub-species of \nthe genus dispassionate enquirer whose intellectual horizons are exactly bounded by a \nbelief in generic management. \nThe control of operations by a context-independent managerialism, however, \nresurrects Taylor\u2019s problematic of \u2018ordinary management\u2019; that of how processes are \nto be controlled by those who do not understand them. Whilst it is one thing to teach \nmanagement to people with experience of the process to be managed, today\u2019s schools \nof business and management turn out tens of thousands of graduates who have been \ntaught only management. Even the MBAs, who are supposed to enter their courses on \nthe basis of practitioner experience, exit them determined to distance themselves from \nthat experience. In the words of the one-time manufacturing director of Lucas, 'a \n 6\nwhole generation of M.B.A. students  . . will not go near a manufacturing strategy . . . \nthey want to be in at the gin-and-tonic end with the financial strategy.' (Parnaby, \n1985) \nWhere Taylor's remedy for the infirmities of \u2018ordinary management\u2019 depended on the \nacquisition (or appropriation) of process expertise by management, much of modern \nmanagement science consists of techniques which substitute for knowledge of the \nprocess. If one cannot understand what people are doing, one can try to motivate or \nlead them. Failing that one can set and monitor budgetary targets. Failing that, one can \nsolicit the opinions of the various \u2018consumers\u2019 of their work, internal or external. \nEvery one of these control techniques corresponds to one of the disciplines of \nmanagement science - managerial psycho-sociology, management accounting and \nmarket research. The question is: are they good substitutes for knowledge of the \nmanaged process? \nImag(in)ing Process \nWhat is common to these managerial technologies is that they articulate with the \nmanaged process, not as a practitioner would understand it, but in a simplified and \nmodelled form. This is not to say that practitioners themselves \u2013 or any human beings \n\u2013 fully understand what they are doing. Humankind cannot bear very much reality \n(Eliot, 1942) and the way we see things, it has been truly said, is always an act of \nchoice (Berger, 1972). As envisaged by the generalised control techniques of \nmanagement science, however, the image of the managed process is subject to \nadditional losses of scope and detail. Motivation theories, such as that of the once \ninfluential Fred Herzberg (1974), are a case in point. Still popular with those for \nwhom social science is a matter of \u2018learning about the properties of humans' (to quote \na former student of mine), theories of this kind offer an automatized view of the \norganisational subordinate, in which increased effort is a reflexive response to the \n'enrichment' of jobs. Contrast this with the view of the managed person, 'I don't feel \nenriched, just knackered.' Made by a unskilled worker during a research project of \nsome years ago (Nichols and Beynon, 1977), this remark has reverberated down the \nyears as a classic commentary on the adequacy of Herzberg's model of the human \nbeing - and on its practical consequences. Through management\u2019s capacity to \noperationalize insult, injury is added \u2013 back injury in this instance. \nThe case of motivation theories suggests that there might be a more general tendency \nfor abstracted and generalised management to generate models which degrade the \nprocesses to which they are applied. The instance of budgetary controls reinforces the \nimpression. Controls of this kind image process outputs as a series of performance \nindicators. Agreeing that the approximate character of these indicators encourages \ndistortions of practice, the literature is split on the question of whose fault this is. Is it \n\u2018gaming behaviour\u2019 on the part of the managed, or is it \u2018the folly of hoping for X \nwhilst measuring Y\u2019 on the part of management? \nThe remainder of the paper consist of a more detailed examination of two techniques \nwhich have recently been developed by management researchers. The first is a \nproposal that product design (in the aesthetic sense) might be controlled through the \nmechanics of market research. The second, familiar to an accounting readership, is the \nmore developed project of controlling indirect costs through the activities which they \nare supposed to pay for. What these otherwise very different techniques have in \ncommon is that they both depend upon a degraded image of the managed process, one \n 7\nwhich threatens to function as a self-fulfilling prophecy in cases of 'successful' \nimplementation. \nAccountable Design \nMy first example concerns the management of product aesthetics. For the enterprise \nof managerialism, labour processes of this kind may be the final frontier. It is here that \nthe Roman march of rational planning, disorientated by the marsh-lights of artistic \ntemperament, loses its way in the Druidic thickets of tacit skill and becomes enmired \nin the sub-articulate quagmires of intuition.2. It is here too, where the labour process \nis at its most opaque, that the attempts of managerialism to subordinate it to corporate \npolicy are at their most revealing. \nWhy is product design important, or, more pertinently, how can it be represented as \nimportant by interested parties? The story begins with an observation, or an assertion, \nthat there are now fields of product market competition - consumer electronics has \nbeen cited as an example - in which the technology has reached a stable plateau \n(Evans , 1990, p. 396). Competitive advantage, it follows, depends on the ability of \nthe product\u2019s physical form to invoke particular images and lifestyles \u2013 at least so say \nthe designers. For corporate managements who buy into this view of things, the \nproblem is one of ensuring that the \u2018creatives\u2019 do indeed connect with the target \nmarket, whilst allowing them sufficient freedom to do so more effectively than the \ncompetition. \nAt the moment the usual solution involves a kind of mixed-media negotiation between \nthe client (management) and the design team. In one study in which I was involved \n(Tomes, Oates and Armstrong, 1998), graphic designers began by boiling down the \ntext of the design brief into a (still textual) \u2018concept\u2019 \u2013 a kind of mantra which would \nbe invoked as a means of keeping the more detailed work on track. This concept \nwould then be expressed in a number of  \u2018vehicles\u2019 \u2013 sketched visual expressions of \nthe concept which would then be shown to the client. This would then set in motion a \nprocess of \u2018conjectures and refutations\u2019 (Broadbent, 1984) in which the designers\u2019 \nsketches (conjectures) and the client\u2019s comments (refutations) would iterate onto a \nmutual understanding of what the other party \u2018meant\u2019. In processes of this kind, the \n\u2018realisation\u2019 of a design brief involves a partial surrender of control on the part of \ncorporate management. Competitive advantage through design, on this pattern, can be \nsecured only through the uncertainties involved in experiencing its seductions. \nGiven the costs of tooling and promotion involved in many product launches, not to \nmention an anal drive to control everything in sight, researchers in management \nscience see a ready market for some means of eliminating the risks involved in \nopening up the decision-making process to the designers' intuition. The project is to \nassure in advance the semiotic connection with markets, to ensure that the product \nspeaks to the consumer as management intends. The terms on which this is to be \nachieved tell us much about the manner in which management science images the \nworkings of design. \n                                                 \n2 Having been instanced in the past as a practitioner of academic over-caution (Moore, \n1991), I offer these bold and imaginative similes as a tribute to what Evelyn Waugh \n(1951) called 'fine writing.'  \n 8\nThe key move is a tacit assumption that the visual and tactile languages of design are \nnothing more than approximate ways of communicating verbally-defined feeling \nstates. Formulae of this kind are the typical product of meetings on corporate \nmarketing policy. In 1994, for example, Thompson Consumer Electronics declared \nthat all of its entertainment products must be \u2018engaging, foster a sense of discovery, \nand eliminate fear.\u2019 \nA study of the \u2018communication effectiveness\u2019 of consumer packs by Bruce and Burrill \n(1995) illustrates how this view of design is underpinning the development of a form \nof audit based on the techniques of market research. In this particular instance, \ninterviews with the designers of the packaging for frozen vegetarian meals were used \nto establish that they believed that their design communicated an image of \n\u2018wholesome, natural, imaginative and home-made products from the sponsor\u2019s \ncountry kitchen\u2019. These claims were then tested against the perceptions of \nrepresentative consumers. Semantic differential questionnaires and focus groups \nrevealed that the messages actually received differed considerably from those \n\u2018intended\u2019 by the designers. A key conclusion of the paper was that \u2018The \nquestionnaire provides reliable data that clearly indicates the strengths and \nweaknesses of attributes of the design.\u2019 \nThe prospect is enticing. In place of the acts of empathy involved in reading design as \none thinks the market will read it, managers can now call upon objective measures of  \nthe meaning conveyed to the target audience. The messages of design can be \ncontrolled, it seems, at least after the event.  \nNotice first of all how this construction of accountability depends on manoeuvring \ndesign onto the discursive terrain of management. Participative and open-ended in \nappearance, the interviews with designers are actually constrained by the assumption \nthat the visual and tactile can be adequately described in terms of verbal abstraction. \nBy this means, designers can be represented as claiming that their work communicates \nmessages which are isomorphic with English sentences. The communicative claims of \ndesign are thereby displaced onto a territory within which such instruments of audit as \nthe semantic differential questionnaire can operate. This is a landscape of feeling-\nstates divided up into administrative units which can be labelled by verbal \nabstractions (\u2018wholesomeness\u2019, and so forth). \nNotice too that the researchers made no attempt to engage with design, either as an \nend product to be experienced, or as a practice to be appreciated. Instead, they \nrequired the designers themselves to translate their work into a form controllable by \nmanagement technique. Politically speaking, the tactic depends on turning \nprofessional expertise against itself. The judgement of the designer is employed as a \nmeans of eliminating managerial dependence on that judgement. That this kind of \nresearch is uncritically accepted as a contribution to the study of the design process \nspeaks volumes for the intellectual hegemony of managerialism within the wider \nresearch community. \nAt first sight, the form of accountability created by this exercise leaves the actual \nprocess of design untouched. It appears to offer a post-hoc evaluation of output rather \nthan the prospect of intervention in the production of design. Once it is assumed that \nthe expressive forms used by designers are equivalent to ordinary language, however, \nit becomes possible to think of design as the manipulation of a relatively stable \nvocabulary of \u2018precedent form.\u2019 Market research techniques can then be used to build \nup a dictionary of correspondences between physical form and its verbal equivalents. \n 9\nIt then becomes thinkable that designs might be assembled so as to communicate \ngiven messages by exposing designers to an appropriate diet of precedent form \n(Pasman and Muller, 1995) or by drawing on an established databank of product \nsemiotics (Kawama, 1987). \nMoves of this kind aim at mapping the territory of design onto that of the marketing \nslogan, so that the one can be controlled by controlling the other. They are, of course, \nbased on a simplistic image of the workings of design. Only the very worst of design, \nlike the worst of art, works by substituting signs for textual messages. The fact that \ndesigner and consumer attach different phrases to a designed object tells us no more \nthan the fact that art critics will use different words to describe a painting, and neither \ntells us much about whether and how either design or art has \u2018communicated\u2019. \nNor does design depend on a \u2018visual language\u2019, if that term is understood to imply a \nrelatively stable lexicon and syntax (Benveniste, 1985; Langer, 1985). It is true that \ncertain stylistic cues may, through emulation, achieve a temporary semiotic \nsignificance. In motor styling the unbroken bonnet-windscreen line which signals \n(stylish and expensive) \u2018people-carrier\u2019 rather than (cheap and nasty) van is an \nexample. For the most part, however, design does not work through the syntactical \nordering of context-independent elements. Blue may be \u2018the very colour of heaven\u2019 \n(Keats on the female iris) but it is also \u2018the colour of distant hills, and boy\u2019s overalls\u2019 \n(Auden on Houseman). In consequence, the notion that the colour of a computer case \nmight be chosen so as to convey such complex textual messages as \u2018Highbrow \nindividuality, creation of a new tradition, intellectual elitism, androgynous sense of \nbeauty, mental ecstasy, interest in the inner world\u2019 (Kawama, 1987 describing a \nproject at Sharp electronics), is somewhat forlorn. The shade of grey actually chosen, \nplus the hard-shell texture, might more plausibly signal \u2018Rhinoceros hide.\u2019 \nThe irony is that design, when it works, is considerably more effective than allowed \nfor in its representations as a managable process. Communication at the sub-verbal \nlevel is also communication beyond the reach of rational critique. Whilst the \npronouncements of the Seymour Powell Consultancy may be far from disinterested, \nthey are also much more convincing as an account of the way in which design can \ncreate and connect with potential consumers than those offered by the management \nresearcher: \nThe X-factor in the product is its essential personality, its desirability quotient, if \nyou like - those intangible, emotional features, over and above function and \nefficiency, that make one product better and more desirable than another. It's the \nfirst thing that strikes you and it often makes itself felt in an immeasurable \nfraction of a second. It's the \"I like it, I want it, what is it?\" element in a product. \nWe're constantly searching for that elusive iconography, the psychological bridge \nbetween consumers as they are and consumers as they\u2019d like to be. \nSeymour Powell (n.d.) \nActivity-Based Cost Management \nMy second example concerns activity-based cost management (ABCM), a technique \nwhich is at a much more advanced stage of development than accountable design. \nEnergetically promoted by all of the big five accounting firms as well as by \nprofessional bodies on both sides of the Atlantic, UK academics are about to discover \nmore about these techniques than they might wish to know. The Higher Education \n 10\nFunding Council will shortly be requiring activity costings of all academic activities \nand the management of activities in the light of this information will surely follow \n(http:\/\/www.hefce.ac.uk\/news\/hefce\/1999\/transrev.htm). \nThe problem which gave rise to ABCM is one which has evaded a definitive solution \nthroughout the 120 year history of cost accounting: the allocation of indirect costs. \nAccountants have no problem \u2013 or think they have no problem \u2013 with the costs of \nmaterials, labour and equipment degradation directly consumed in a production \nprocess. The difficulty arises in how to allocate those costs which are not directly \nconnected to a product. The costs of departments such as Research and Development, \nMarketing, Human Resources, Finance and Public Relations, for example, all have to \nbe recovered through the sale of products, and the question is how they can be \n\u2018equitably\u2019 assigned to those products. \nBefore activity-based costing, the usual solution was to allocate these indirect costs on \na single \u2018allocation base\u2019 \u2013 often direct labour costs, but sometimes the total of direct \ncosts. Taking a typical level of indirect costs and a typical production volume, indirect \ncosts would then be distributed as a percentage mark-up on the costs which serve as \nan allocation base. \nCrude and simple, such a method of cost allocation was acceptable (so runs the \nfounding myth of activity-based costing) so long as indirect costs were a small \nproportion of the total and product markets were slack enough to allow for a margin \nof error on prices. Over time, however, both of these conditions were eroded. Firstly, \nan increase in the capital intensity of production processes, meant that the indirect \ncosts could be many times the base of direct costs onto which they were loaded. \nSecondly, there was an intensification of product market competition, particularly \nfrom the Far East. The first exposed the arbitrariness of single-base cost allocation \n(persistently and tendentiously misrepresented as \u2018inaccuracy\u2019 by the advocates of \nactivity-based costing). The second made it important to identify which of a \ncompany\u2019s products remained profitable when margins were being squeezed. \nAccounting researchers and consultants had identified \u2013 or created \u2013 a market for a \n\u2018more accurate\u2019 means of allocating indirect costs (see, for example, Cooper and \nKaplan, 1991) \nTaken literally, this was an expotition in search of an oxymoron3. If costs are truly \nindirect, there is by definition no correct way, even in principle, of allocating them to \nproducts. Consequently there can be no standard by which the accuracy of any \npractical method might be judged. It is not the way of management research, however, \nto let philosophical niceties stand in the way of scientific advance. The ambition of \nactivity-based costing was to identify the costs of the actual activities which were \nperformed \u2018for\u2019 products and, in its more overweening versions, to distribute all \ncompany costs according to the consumption of those activities in production \nprocesses (e.g. Kaplan, 1987). In other words all costs were declared henceforth to be \n                                                 \n3 An expotition is a kind of postmodern expedition, in which the objective emerges as \na by-product of aimless activity. So it was when Piglet fell into a stream on \nChristopher Robin's expotition. The long pole with which Pooh accomplished his \nrescue turned out to be the North Pole, which was then discovered to be the objective \nof the expotition (Milne 1930). It may be that 'accuracy' as an objective of cost \nallocation was discovered in a similar fashion. \n 11\ndirect - since they were, or ought to be, the direct costs of the activities which go into \nproducts. More politically circumspect advocates of the technique recognised that \nsuch items as the chairman\u2019s company car, not to mention his salary and secretarial \nsupport might be difficult to justify in such terms. These \u2018moderates\u2019, which by 1988 \nincluded Robert Kaplan himself, proposed to except such essential \u2018period costs\u2019 from \nthe unsympathetic scrutiny implied by activity-based costing. \nAllocating the costs of support activities in this manner, the advocates of activity-\nbased costing had little difficulty in producing product costs which differed radically \nfrom those produced by single\u2013base absorption costing. Disarmingly, these \ndifferences have repeatedly been presented in a highly partisan literature as \u2018proof\u2019 of \nthe greater accuracy of activity-based costing, as if any discrepancy were \nautomatically to the discredit of absorption costing (e.g. Innes and Mitchell, 1990, p. \n14). In particular, many of these schematic calculations \u2018demonstrated\u2019 that the use of \ndirect labour as an allocation base loads indirect costs disproportionately onto labour \nintensive processes, thus inflating their apparent cost and leading firms to abandon \ncompetition in the world\u2019s mass markets. For American capitalism, these were \nweighty matters and I would not wish to minimise the achievement of the activity \nbased costing movement in destabilising costing tradition. My concern here, however, \nis not with the merits of the activity system of  cost allocation, but with the technique \nof cost management which developed from it. \nOnce the activities which connect indirect costs to products have been established for \nthe purposes of cost allocation, the potential for actually managing costs is obvious. \nFirstly, those indirect costs which cannot be justified in terms of such activities may \nbe eliminated, a process of organisational eugenics which is dignified in management \nwritings as \u2018value analysis.\u2019 Secondly, the volume of at least some of the support \nactivities may be varied in line with any variations in the volume of production. \nThirdly, the exposure of the activities which are paid for by the indirect costs loaded \nonto products and processes, may enable the managers of these products and \nprocesses to press for the elimination of those services they feel they can do without. \nAll three of these potentials have been amply realised in case studies of activity-based \ncost management (e.g. Cooper et al, 1992). The result, so say the advocates, is a \nleaner, meaner organisation totally focussed on customer value. What could be more \nsensible? \nThe crucial question is that of what is eliminated, and this in turn depends on how the \nactivities performed \u2018for\u2019 products are identified. Treated as a secondary matter of \noperationalisation in the literature, this actually lies at the heart of activity-based cost \nmanagement. In every case I have read, the procedure depended on interviews with \nthe heads of staff departments conducted by an ABCM implementation committee \nconsisting of line managers and management accountants (e.g. Cooper et al, 1992). In \nthese interviews, the heads of departments were required to list the activities through \nwhich their departments contributed to the productive processes of the organisation, to \nestimate the proportion of staff time and other expenditure consumed in these \nactivities, and to agree an easily detectable proxy for a unit occurrence of each of \nthem (as an act of materials purchase is signalled by a requisition). The procedure, we \nare told by prominent advocates of the technique, is complete only when the whole of \nstaff time and equipment usage is accounted for (Innes and Mitchell, 1990, p. 8.) \nClearly these interviews are something of an inquisition, given that the stakes are not \ndifficult to discern. Like the interviews with product designers, they use the expertise \n 12\nof the staff manager as an instrument with which to demystify the inner workings of \nthe department. And it is in these interviews \u2013 not in the programmatic intentions of \nactivity-based costing - that its image of the staff department is created. It is an image \nwhich allows for no contribution of the staff department to the objectives of the \norganisation other than directly through products and services. It is seen as service \ndepartment, one which exists for no other purpose than to support the productive \nprocess. These services, moreover, are assumed to consist of repeated activities, as \nthey must be if a unit cost is to be established  for each. The end result is an image of \nthe staff department as a mass-producer of  repeated - and therefore routine - acts of  \nservice. And it is seen in these terms because this is the only way in which its \n\u2018activities\u2019 can be used as a basis of allocating its costs. \nThis may not matter so long as it is only the allocation of costs which is at issue. But \nwhat happens when this information is used as a means of managing costs? Here we \nare short of data. There has been a considerable number of case studies of the \nintroduction of activity-based cost allocation, all of them predicated on the \nassumption of its technical superiority, but many of them reporting the failure or \nabandonment of the project. Lacking, however, are studies of the long-term \nconsequences of \u2018successful\u2019 systems, in which the activities, as identified, are used as \nan instrument of management as well as cost allocation. We must fall back on an \nexamination of the logic of the system. \nVirtually every staff function in the modern corporation has its professional and \nacademic arms. The Chartered Institutes of Marketing, Purchasing and Supply, and \nManagement Accounting, as well as the soon-to-be Chartered Institute of Personnel \nand Development, all of them see a much larger role for themselves than the supply of \nlow-level services to production departments. Every one of them, moreover, sees its \nmission as one of promoting its potential contribution to company strategy, with \ncommensurate rewards and career prospects for its practitioners. Whilst  there may be \nmuch in this of self-interest and self-important puffery, few of us are in a position to \ndismiss these claims out of hand, and certainly not the line managers and management \naccountants of  an ABC implementation committee. And yet this is precisely the logic \nof its analysis of activities. Building up strategic information on potential product \nmarkets, creating value through the supply chain, engineering workforce commitment \nand gathering information on competitor costs for the purposes of strategic \nmanagement accounting: none of these are direct services to production function \n(some of them, indeed, threaten its established routines), and none of them are \nreducible to repeated and routine actions. The implementation of ABCM, therefore, \ncreates pressures for their elimination. That pressure is often resisted, of course (e.g. \nCooper et al, 1992). In general the outcome will depend on the relative influence of the \nfunction in question and the ABC implementation team. The pressure is always there \nin potential, however, and is likely to intensify when profit margins are squeezed and \nall expenditure with long-term and indeterminate payoffs comes under scrutiny. \nThe general point is that activity-based cost management depends upon, and therefore \noperationalizes, a degraded image of the staff functions. Under conditions which \nfavour its promise of containing indirect costs \u2013 in general those of financial \nstringency \u2013 this image will tend to operate as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Staff activity \nmay indeed be reduced to the provision of low-level, routine services. Meanwhile the \nactivity-based cost management consultants will be able to point to short-run cost \nsavings, whilst the consequences of lost capabilities will only work through the \nsystem when they are long gone. \n 13\nConclusions \nDuring the 1980s, the Harvard Business Review's most-requested reprint was Hayes \nand Abernathy's 'Managing our Way to Economic Decline' (1980), a swingeing attack \non the 'pseudo professionalism' of senior managements for whom neither industry \nexperience nor technical expertise counted. Incapable of dealing with the 'messy' \ncomplexity of concrete processes, such managers demanded that issues should be \npresented for decision-making in the form of simple numbers. Management of this \ncharacter, argued Hayes and Abernathy, was incapable of competing effectively in the \nword's markets for manufactured goods. \nTwo decades later, one wonders who ordered all those reprints and what they made of \nthem. The ground assumption behind virtually the whole of management teaching, \nresearch and consultancy is still the abstracted and generalised model of management \noutlined in the first part of this paper. Correspondingly, the 'practical' techniques \ndeveloped by management and accounting research are still, at bottom, ways of \nmodelling concrete processes in forms which appear intelligible and tractable to the \nmanagement 'specialist.' Like the approximations of physics and engineering science, \nmodels of this kind have limits to their range of applicability, and it is all too easy to \nstray beyond these limits, forgetting that they are assumptions and models. I do not \nbelieve the particular dysfunctions of the particular models outlined in this paper are \nat all unusual. I think that similar difficulties will always follow from an over-reliance \non simplified representations. \nAt the level of practical politics, the prospects for mounting a wholesale challenge to \nthe context-independent model of management (sic!) are forlorn indeed. As well as \nthe vested interests of management education and consultancy, it is sustained at the \nhigher levels of management by the capitalist mode of production itself, since in this \nsocial form the ultimate authority over the means of production lies with property \nrights, not expertise. Within this limitation, it remains possible, as a project of \nongoing critique, to explore the discrepancies between managerial and practitioner \nmodels of particular process - including accounting models - and the consequences of \nthese discrepancies. As a more general payoff which might be recognised by practical \npeople, it may be possible to show that there are processes (like aesthetic design) for \nwhich negotiated relationships are more effective than attempts to manage as this is \nconventionally understood - perhaps on the half-forgotten model of industrial \nrelations pluralism (e.g. Flanders, 1970). \nI doubt, however, that the enabling conditions are in place for any programme of \nresearch which depends on an interrogation of the abstracted and generalised \nconception of management. Most management researchers \u2013 and here I include the \nself-styled \u2018critical management\u2019 circuit \u2013 also buy into this view of management, \nbecause that is how they define both their field of study and their constituency. \nReferences \nArmstrong P.
