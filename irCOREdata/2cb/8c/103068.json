Molecular modelling\/docking studies indicated that three of \nthese compounds (myricetin, liquiritigenin and gossypetin) would be likely to form stable \ncomplexes with the enzyme. The results of the virtual screening studies were subsequently \nconfirmed experimentally, by in-vitro (fluorimetric) assay of the compounds\u2019 inhibitory \nactivity. The IC-50s for the flavones, myricetin and gossypetin were determined as 10 \u00b5M and \n11 \u00b5M, respectively, whilst the flavanone, liquiritigenin, gave an IC-50 of 0.34 \u00b5M \u2013 showing \nabout a 10 fold increase in potency, therefore, over the first generation aromatase inhibitor, \naminoglutethimide. \n \nKeywords \n \nCytochrome P450, CYP19, aromatase, traditional Chinese medicine, myricetin, gossypetin, \nliquiritigenin \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nAround one-in-nine women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their \nlife [1], and 50-80% of these suffer tumours that are oestrogen-dependent [2] \u2013 with the \ntumour cells expressing oestrogen receptors, and the growth of the tumours being stimulated \nby circulating oestrogen. These oestrogen-dependent mammary carcinomas can be combated \nthrough the use of anti-oestrogens (like tamoxifen), that interfere with the binding of \noestrogen to its receptor, or else through the use of aromatase inhibitors, that act to decrease \nthe circulating levels of oestrogen by blocking the biosynthesis of the compound from \nandrogens [3]. \n \nAromatase, also known as CYP19, is produced to high levels in breast tissue, and particularly \nin those areas in and around tumour sites [3]. The enzyme is competitively inhibited by \nsteroidal compounds like exemastane, but also by various non-steroidal compounds, such as \naminoglutethimide (Figure 1). The orally-active, potent, and highly selective (third \ngeneration) aromatase inhibitors that are licensed for clinical use (in the treatment of \nmetastatic oestrogen-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women) include anastrozole, \nletrosole and exemastane (Figure 1). \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \nOther known inhibitors of the enzyme include various flavonoid compounds, in particular \nthose based on the flavone and flavanone skeletons [3]. These compounds have attracted \nconsiderable interest in regard to aromatase inhibition, in part because of the hypothesis put \nforward that these natural products may represent dietary factors that account for the \nsignificantly lower incidence of breast cancer among women of Asian and Oriental origin [4], \nand also because of the reported general inverse association between the incidence of breast \ncancer and consumption of flavonoid-rich vegetables [5-6]. \n \nIn the work reported here, the aim was to use the structural data on the phytochemical \nconstituents from herbs commonly used in traditional Chinese medicines, to prospect for \nnovel aromatase inhibitors, using a combination of multiple decision tree (Random Forest) \nmodelling and molecular docking studies, with the hits identified through these in-silico \npredictions then confirmed through laboratory-based experiments. \n \n \nMethods \n \nRandom Forest Modelling Structural data on the known phytochemical constituents of 240 \nherbs widely used in traditional Chinese medicine were taken from the Chinese Herbal \nConstituents Database (CHCD) [7]. A total of 238 different structural descriptors for these \ncompounds were then computed; specifically, the full set of 150 2D MOE descriptors \n(Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec), 56 Kier-Hall descriptors [8-9], and 32 \nLabute VSA descriptors [10]. Random Forest (RF) models for prediction of aromatase \ninhibitory activity were derived using activity data taken from the Bio-active Plant \nCompounds Database (BPCD) [7]. The RF modelling, performed using Random Forests, \nversion 1 (Salford Systems, San Diego, California) was carried out as described by Ehrman et \nal [11-12]. The MOE, Kier-Hall and Labute descriptor sets were used in generating three \nseparate RF models, each comprising an ensemble of 500 decision trees. For each tree in the \nensemble, a bootstrap sample was randomly chosen from the minority class of 44 BPCD \ncompounds with known anti-aromatase activity, and the same number of cases then randomly \nselected to add to this group from the majority class of 8,264 CHCD compounds. Decision \ntrees were then constructed, following the CART algorithm, and employing the Gini splitting \ncriterion (see [11-12]). The error rates associated with the resulting RF predictions were \nquantified using the technique of \u201cout-of-bag\u201d (OOB) cross-validation, with ~33% of the \nbootstrap compounds withheld for each tree trained in order to provide an independent test \nsample. By such means the prediction performance of the RF is measured by taking the OOB \nsample for each tree, running it through that tree, computing the associated error rate, and \nthen averaging the error rates over all 500 trees to obtain the mean misclassification rate for \nthe entire forest. The mean misclassification rates thus obtained (calculated with an RF cut-off \nvalue of 0.5) were 30%, 21%, and 32%, for the RF models generated using the MOE, Kier-\nHall and Labute descriptor sets, respectively. In the present work, however, much more \nstringent criteria were employed to identify potential aromatase inhibitors: the CHCD \ncompounds taken as hits being those that achieved aromatase activity RF scores of \u2265 0.8 in at \nleast two of the three RF models (a score of 0.8 here meaning that 80% of the decision trees \nwithin a given RF model voted for a compound to exhibit aromatase activity). By such means \nthe resulting predictions were made more dependable, but with the attendant limitation that \nthe CHCD hits would then be (structurally) very similar to the bioactive compounds most \nnumerous in the RF training set, viz., the flavonoids. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nMolecular Modelling  The construction of molecular models of potential aromatase \ninhibitors, and the docking of these ligands into the enzyme active site, were first performed \nusing Hyperchem\u2122 version 7 (Hypercube Inc., Gainesville, Florida). The atomic co-ordinates \nfor the homology modelled structure of human aromatase were downloaded from the Protein \nData Bank [13] (accession code, 1TQA, [14] ). Ligands were initially docked manually, and \nthe resulting complexes then optimised using the AMBER force field [15], with Polak-Ribi\u00e8re \nconjugate gradient minimisation to a final potential energy gradient of 0.001 kcal.mole-1.\u00c5-1. \nFor each of the three ligands, a total of five initial poses were considered (with superposed \ncentroids but varying orientations), and the optimisation of these complexes performed with \nmovement allowed only to the ligand atoms (all protein atoms being treated as fixed). Further \ndocking studies were subsequently performed using the FlexX program [16] (BioSolveIT \nGmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany). In this case, the protein residues involved in the binding \nsite for each ligand were defined with reference to the ligand pose in the most stable of the \nHyperchem\u2122-modelled complexes. The FlexX docking was in all cases performed without \nconstraints, and using the default values for all adjustable control parameters. \n \nIn-vitro assay of aromatase inhibitory activity Liquiritigenin (7-hydroxy-2-(4-\nhydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one), gossypetin (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7,8-\ntetrahydroxychromen-4-one) and myricetin (3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(3,4,5-\ntrihydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one) were purchased from LGC Standards Ltd (Teddington, \nUK) and were used as received. Aromatase inhibition assays were performed using the \nCYP19\/MFC high-throughput screening kit (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Substrate for the \nreaction was 7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (MFC). Enzyme reactions were \nperformed, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, using ethanol solutions of the potential \ninhibitors, in Greiner (flat bottom, black) 96-well plates (Sigma, Dorset, UK), with \nfluorescence measurements recorded using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtech Ltd, \nAylesbury, UK), and employing an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission \nwavelength of 520 nm. All assays were performed at ambient, and fluorescence \nmeasurements recorded at five-minute intervals over a period of 1 hr. A CYP19 concentration \nof 7.5 nM was employed, with a fixed substrate concentration of 25 \u00b5M. Fluorescence-time \nprofiles for each reaction were corrected for background fluorescence, and the initial catalytic \nrates in the presence of inhibitor expressed as a fraction of the rate for the uninhibited \nenzyme. The assays for the TCM constituents were carried out in duplicate on two separate \noccasions, but the assay for ketoconazole was carried out only in triplicate (on a single \noccasion). \n \n \nResults & Discussion \n \nThe structural features of 44 phytochemicals with known aromatase activity were used in \ntraining Random Forest (RF) models to distinguish likely aromatase inhibitors in 8,264 \nconstituents of 240 different herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The \ncompounds with known aromatase activity comprised eighteen assorted flavonoids (55% of \nthe total), nine sesquiterpenes (27% of the total), with the remainder including alkaloids, \ntannins, lignans, di- and tri-terpenes, aliphatics and sterols. The trivial names for the 30 TCM \ncompounds achieving the highest RF scores in this screening are listed in Table 1, along with \ntheir systematic names, botanical source(s) and anti-aromatase RF scores. Several of the hits \nidentified are for compounds already known to inhibit the aromatase enzyme, including \napigenin (with an IC-50 of ~1 \u00b5M) [17], and diadzein, genistein, and galangin (with Ki values \nof the order of 100 \u00b5M) [18]. Of the 22 compounds in this short list that do not appear yet to \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nhave been tested for anti-aromatase activity, three compounds, namely, liquiritigenin, \ngossypetin, and myricetin could be obtained commercially. These compounds (the chemical \nstructures for which are shown in Figure 2) were selected for further study. Myricetin has \nlong been recognised as an anti-oxidant [19] and is also shown to inhibit mitogen-activated \nprotein kinase kinase [20]. Liquiritigenin has been shown to have apoptotic [21] and cytotoxic \n[22] effects, and also to inhibit tyrosinase [23] and monoamine oxidase [24]. Gossypetin has \npreviously been shown to have anti-inflammatory [25] and anti-allergic [26] activity. \n \nIn order to provide a further test of the likely inhibitory activity of the three chosen herbal \nconstituents against human aromatase, in-silico experiments were conducted to dock the \nligands into the enzyme binding site, both manually and using the FlexX [16] software. For \neach ligand, various initial poses were considered, but all in the vicinity of residues previously \nidentified (on the basis of the model building studies) as lining the enzyme active site pocket \n[14]. These residues - many of which have also been demonstrated to be key determinants in \nligand binding through site-directed mutagenesis experiments [18, 27-30] \u2013 include Glu 302, \nThr 310, Ser 478 and His 480. \n \nOn the basis of the manual docking, it was shown that the two flavones, gossypetin and \nmyricetin did not give as good a fit to the enzyme binding site as the flavanone, liquiritigenin. \nFor the flavones, the potential energies of the complexes were in the range -88 - -67 kJ.mole-1 \nand -67 - -38 kJ.mole-1 (for myricetin and gossypetin, respectively), whereas the energies for \nthe liquiritigenin complexes lay in the range -105 - -84 kJ.mole-1. On the basis of the manual \ndocking, therefore, liquiritigenin was predicted to show a greater inhibitory activity against \naromatase than either of the two flavones. Liquiritigenin, with its L-shaped form, dictated by \nthe conformational flexibility of the heterocyclic ring and the \u03b1-substituent at C-2, appears \nbetter suited to the shape of the enzyme binding site than the more planar flavones (see Figure \n3). Although the most stable of the manually docked liquiritigenin complexes showed no \nprotein-ligand hydrogen bonds, such interactions were seen in some of the lower ranked \nstructures, typically between the ring hydroxyls and various sites on the protein main chain.  \n \nIn the FlexX docking studies, the highest scoring (most stable) complexes were found to be \nthose involving myricetin and gossypetin. The energies for the top 20 poses ranged from -23 \nto -13 kJ.mole-1 for myricetin, and from -20 to -12 kJ.mole-1for gossypetin. In contrast, the top \n20 poses for liquiritigenin complexes gave energies in the range -18 to -9 kJ.mole-1. \nInspection of the FlexX modelled complexes for the two flavone ligands revealed that the \nimproved binding was often associated with a twisting of the chromene and phenyl rings \u2013 \nwith the C2-C1\u2019 dihedral angle generally increased from ~0o to ~60o (see Figure 4). Such \ntwisting (which was not seen in any of the Hyperchem\u2122 optimised models) seemed to allow \nfor greater protein-ligand hydrogen bonding. \n \nIt was found, therefore, that the FlexX and manual docking studies were not consistent: the \nlatter suggested that the order of anti-aromatase activities would be myricetin > gossypetin > \nliquiritigenin, whereas the former suggested that the order would be liquiritigenin > myricetin \n> gossypetin. Laboratory-based assays were thus conducted for all of the compounds. \n \nIn-vitro testing of the activities of the putative aromatase inhibitors was carried out by means \nof a coupled fluorometric assay, monitoring the reduction in fluorescence associated with \nformation of the CYP19 product (7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin). IC-50s for each \ninhibitor, including that for the positive control, ketoconazole, were determined from the \npercentage inhibition-concentration plots (Figure 5). For the flavones, myricetin and \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \ngossypetin, (Figure 5B,C) the IC-50s were found to be 10 \u00b5M and 11 \u00b5M, respectively, \nwhereas that for the flavanone, liquiritigenin (Figure 5A) was found to be 0.34 \u00b5M. The IC-50 \nfor ketoconazole (Figure 5D) was recorded as 3 \u00b5M \u2013 consistent with the value of 3.8 \u00b5M \nquoted by the suppliers. \n \nIt is seen, therefore, that the rank ordering of the activities for the three TCM compounds \nagrees with the ordering predicted on the basis of the manual docking studies, but not that \npredicted on the basis of the FlexX docking studies. In part this might be attributed to the \nemphasis given by FlexX to establishing hydrogen bonding between the ligands and protein \u2013 \nsuch that the polyhydroxylated flavones erroneously appear capable of forming more \nextensive interactions with the aromatase enzyme than the (dihydroxy) flavanone, \nliquiritigenin. It must also be borne in mind, however, that the agreement between the manual \ndocking and in-vitro test results may be entirely fortuitous, since neither the manual docking \nnor the FlexX docking studies allowed for any conformational changes in the protein, nor did \nthey take into account the associated entropic changes (with the stability of the complexes \njudged purely in terms of their potential energies). With this in mind then, it is perhaps better \nsimply to record that both the manual docking and FlexX docking studies indicated that all \nthree of the TCM compounds would be likely to form stable complexes with the aromatase \nenzyme, and that this was borne out in the experimental studies. \n \nSeveral recent reviews (cf. [31-32]) have attested to the benefits to be gained through the \napplication of virtual screening methods in large scale data mining of natural product \ndatabases, with much improved levels of success seen when the phytochemical data are \nsupplemented by ethnobotanical\/ethnopharmacological information [33-34]. In the work \nreported here, it has been shown that the combination of a ligand-based primary in-silico \nscreening followed by a protein-based secondary (in-silico) screening can provide a reliable \nmeans of prospecting natural product databases in the search for new leads in drug discovery. \nGiven that the CHCD search database indirectly embodies ethnopharmacological information, \nthe primary RF screen is both efficient in identifying suitable lead compounds, and \nsufficiently rapid that it can be used in a truly high throughput manner, permitting desktop \nprocessing of thousands of phytochemicals within minutes. The hits so obtained can then be \nsubjected to the more stringent but more time-consuming docking studies, to identify suitable \ncompounds for in-vitro testing. By such means, therefore, it will be possible more effectively \nto exploit the rich resource of plant secondary metabolites in the search for new therapeutic \nleads. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nReferences \n \n1.

For the protein residues, covalent geometry \nis shown using half-bond colouring, according to the colour scheme: carbon, grey; oxygen, \nred; nitrogen, blue; sulphur, yellow; and hydrogen, white. Liquiritigenin is shown in violet. \nThe molecular solvent accessible surfaces are shown by means of dots, colour-coded \naccording to the underlying atom type (see above). It is notable that the ligand forms no \nhydrogen bond interactions with the protein but has an L-shaped form that allows it to fit \nsnugly within the available space. Selected residues within the protein active site are labelled. \n \n \nFigure 4 \n \nMolecular model (derived through FlexX docking) of a potential complex formed between \nhuman aromatase and gossypetin. Details as for Figure 3. The dihedral angle describing the \nrelative orientation of the (bicyclic) chromene and phenyl rings in the ligand is 60o. Potential \nhydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines, and the protein residues involved are labelled. \n \n \nFigure 5 \n \nAromatase inhibitory activity of (A) liquiritigenin, (B) gossypetin, (C) myricetin and (D) \nketaconazole (positive control), as a function of ligand concentration. Error bars show the \nstandard deviations on the data (n = 4, except for ketoconazole where n = 3). Arrows indicate \nthe calculated IC-50s of the inhibitors. \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nTable 1 \n \nConstituent IUPAC name Botanical source(s) RF score \nDaidzein 4',7-Dihydroxyisoflavone Sophora subprostrata 0.994 \nGenistein 4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone Sophora subprostrata 0.990 \nGalangin 3,5,7-Trihydroxyflavone Alpinia officinarum, Alpinia galanga 0.988 \nNorwogonin 5,7,8-Trihydroxyflavone Scutellaria spp. 0.985 \nEriodictyol 3',4',5,7-Tetrahydroxyflavanone Many spp. 0.985 \nMatairesinol 4,4'-Dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxylignan-9,9'-olide Arctium lappa 0.980 \nHelenalin 6-Hydroxy-4-oxo-2,11(13)-pseudoguaiadien-12,8-olide Inula helenium 0.979 \nHomoeryodictyol 4',5,7-Trihydroxy-3'-\nmethoxyflavanone Coriandrum sativum 0.975 \nLiquiritigenin 4',7-Dihydroxyflavanone Dalbergia odorifera 0.973 \nDemethoxycapillarisin \n5,7-Dihydroxy-2-(4-\nhydroxyphenoxy)-4H-1-benzopyran-\n4-one \nArtemisia capillaris 0.972 \n4-Epiisoinuviscolide 4-Hydroxy-9,11(13)-guaiadien-12,8-\nolide Inula helenium 0.963 \nIsoliquiritigenin 2',4,4'-Trihydroxychalcone Dalbergia odorifera, Astragalus mongholicus 0.962 \nEupahakonin B \n1-Hydroxy-8-(4-hydroxy-2-\nhydroxymethyl-2E-butenoyloxy)-\n3,10(14),11(13)-guaiatrien-12,6-olide \nEupatorium chinense var. \nhakonense 0.959 \nDehydrozaluzanin C 3-Oxo-4(15),10(14),11(13)-guaiatrien-12,6-olide \nSaussurea lappa (& \nMunnozia maronii) 0.958 \nHesperetin 3',5,7-Trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone Schizonepeta tenuifolia 0.956 \nIsolicoflavonol 3,4',5,7-Tetrahydroxy-3'-prenylflavone Glycyrrhiza uralensis 0.952 \nCorylinal 2-Hydroxy-5-(7-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl)benzaldehyde Psoralea corylifolia 0.951 \n2'-Hydroxygenistein 2',4',5,7-Tetrahydroxyisoflavone Lablab niger 0.941 \nLicodione 1-(2,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3-propanedione Glycyrrhiza echinata 0.939 \nGossypetin 3,3',4',5,7,8-Hexahydroxyflavone Pyrrosia petiolosa 0.933 \nPinocembrin 5,7-Dihydroxyflavanone Glycyrrhiza spp., Alpinia katsumadai 0.930 \nScutellarein 4',5,6,7-Tetrahydroxyflavone Scutellaria spp.. 0.919 \n2-Hydroxytomentosin-1,5-\nepoxide \n1,5-Epoxy-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-11(13)-\nxanthen-12,8-olide Xanthium strumarium 0.912 \nEpiacetylaleuritolic acid 3-Acetoxy-14-taraxeren-28-oic acid Phytolacca acinosa 0.911 \n2-Hydroxyalantolactone 2-Hydroxy-5,11(13)-eudesmadien-12,8-olide Inula helenium 0.910 \nApigenin 4',5,7-Trihydroxyflavone Ginkgo biloba, Pogostemon \ncablin, Coriandrum sativum 0.910 \nAcacetin 5,7-Dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone Ginkgo biloba 0.910 \nMelanoxetin 3,3',4',7,8-Pentahydroxyflavone Albizzia lebbek 0.910 \nMyricetin 3,3',4',5,5',7-Hexahydroxyflavone Impatiens balsamina, Biota \norientalis 0.905 \nMelandrin 5-Hydroxy-N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) \nanthranilic acid Melandrium firmum 0.904 \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \n(A) \nO\nO\nH\nH\nH\n \n \n(B) \nN\nH\nO\nNH2\nO\n \n \n(C) \nN\nN\nN\nCNNC\n \n \n(D) \nN\nN\nN\nCNNC\n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n(A) \nO\nO\nHO\nOH\nH\n \n \n \n \n(B) \nO\nOH\nOH\nOH\nO\nHO\nOH\nOH\n \n \n \n \n(C) \nO\nOH\nOH O\nHO\nOH\nOH\nOH\n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \n(A) \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \n(B) \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \n(C) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \n(D) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nGraphical abstract \n \n \n \n"}
