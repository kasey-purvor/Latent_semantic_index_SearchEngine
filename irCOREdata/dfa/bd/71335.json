Thermal waves are\nsensitive to the heat capacity as well as the thermal conduc-\ntivity, providing an extra source of contrast. Moreover, un-\nlike the case for varying elastic fields, the intrinsically\ndamped thermal wave propagation can be controlled through\nthe oscillation frequency f: the thermal penetration depth\u2014\nessentially the thermal diffusion length\u2014decreases with in-\ncreasing frequency as 1\/f 1\/2, and so it is advantageous in\nmicroscopy with thermal waves to work at high frequencies\nin order to achieve a high spatial resolution. Because of the\nongoing trend toward device miniaturization with features\nless than ;100 nm in size, local probing of thermal modu-\nlation phenomena is an area of paramount importance.\nOne approach that combines oscillating ~that is, ac! tem-\nperature fields and local probing is based on the use of a\nmodulated heat source in the tip.3,4 Although useful images\nsensitive to thermal diffusivity have been obtained, such ex-\nperiments are difficult to interpret because the depth resolu-\ntion is often strongly influenced by near-field thermal effects\ngoverned by the probe size and tip\u2013sample thermal resis-\ntance rather than by the modulation frequency.2 A different\napproach that avoids this complication is based on the local\nprobing of thermal expansion: subsurface periodic resistive\nheating5,6 or chopped optical radiation7\u20139 generate surface\nvibrations that can then be mapped to a lateral resolution of\na few nanometers in standard atomic force microscope\n~AFM! or scanning tunneling microscope configurations.\na!Present address: Symyx Technologies, Inc., 3100 Central Expressway,\nSanta Clara, CA 95051.\nb!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nassp@kino-ap.eng.hokudai.ac.jp6220003-6951\/2003\/82(4)\/622\/3\/$20.00\nDownloaded 03 Apr 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to This produces additional contrast through the thermal expan-\nsion coefficient. However, such imaging with these ac local\nthermal probing techniques so far has been done at frequen-\ncies &100 kHz, corresponding to a thermal penetration depth\nin insulators that is greater than ;1 mm. This is still too low\na frequency for optimal ac thermal imaging of thin films or\nstructures of thickness in the ;100 nm range or below. There\nis, therefore, a pressing need to extend such ac local thermal\nimaging to significantly higher frequencies.\nToward this end, we make use of a technique that we\nterm optical heterodyne force microscopy ~OHFM!, involv-\ning the local probing of photothermally induced ultrasonic\nsurface vibrations. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup,\nbased on a commercial AFM ~TM Microscopes, CP-M!.

The cantilever base is vibrated with a piezoelectric\ntransducer operating in thickness resonance at an amplitude\nDx\u20190.8 nm and at a frequency f 2 (54.220 MHz), slightly\ndifferent from f 1 . This vibration is transmitted down the\ncantilever, which acts as an acoustic waveguide, and pro-\nduces a vibration of the tip with a dominant component per-\npendicular to the sample surface. Because of the nonlinearity\nof the tip\u2013sample force curve, a vibration ~,100 pm in am-\nplitude! of the contacting tip is induced at a frequency f 1\n2 f 2 (;3 kHz). This is much lower than the fundamental\ncantilever resonance ~38 kHz! but much higher than the re-\nsponse frequency of the AFM feedback loop maintaining the\nconstant average deflection of the cantilever ~through sample\nstage motion!. The differential output of the AFM photodi-\node is fed to a lock-in amplifier tuned to f 12 f 2 to obtain\nOHFM amplitude and phase images. While scanning, only\nthe sample stage is moved, ensuring a well-defined geometry\nfor sample heating. The principle of OHFM is related to that\nof ultrasonic force microscopy ~UFM!.12\nA cross section of part of the multilayer microstructure\nsample is shown in Fig. 2. For the fabrication, polystyrene\nbeads of diameter 10 mm are sprinkled onto a silica substrate\nand a 180 nm layer of polycrystalline Al is then overlaid by\nelectron-beam deposition. The beads are then removed by\nwashing in distilled water, and a final 90 nm film of poly-\ncrystalline Cr is deposited in the same way. The thickness of\nthe Al was measured using AFM and that of the Cr using\npicosecond ultrasonics.13 This microstructure provides a\ngood test for the detection of subsurface thermal properties\non submicron scales for several reasons: ~1! The sample sur-\nface is optically and elastically homogeneous, allowing us to\nstudy thermal contrast. ~The optical absorption depth of Cr at\n830 nm is z\u201915 nm, with optical reflectivity R50.63.) ~2!\nThe thermal diffusion length of the silica substrate at ;4\nMHz is 0.25 mm, restricting the thermal penetration to a\nsubmicron depth.14 ~3! The thermal expansion coefficient of\nAl is ;5 times larger than that of Cr and is expected to give\nnoticeable contrast.15\nWe first measured the OHFM signals as a function of\nincident laser power and ultrasonic excitation voltage on the\ntwo-layer portion of the sample. The results for amplitude\nare shown in Figs. 2~a! and 2~b!. Within the experimental\nerror ~;620%!, the amplitudes are proportional to the exci-\nFIG. 2.

This behavior is consistent with the\npredictions of a spring and mass model of the system if the\ntip\u2013sample interaction is modeled as a nonlinear spring ~see\nFig. 1 inset!. One can show that, for fixed f 1 and f 2 , the\namplitude of the tip at the difference frequency Dy\n}k1DzDx , where k15]2F\/]d2 is the nonlinear coefficient\nof the force\u2013distance curve.16 This implies that OHFM fa-\ncilitates the measurement of the small sample vibration of\namplitude Dz by the multiplication with the larger base am-\nplitude Dx . Another important prediction is that the phase f\nof the vibration at f 1 is transferred to the phase of the vibra-\ntion at f 12 f 2 . So the OHFM phase directly probes the high-\nfrequency sample response ~at f 1).\nFigure 3 shows topography, UFM and OHFM amplitude\nand phase images for a 2.5 mm32.5 mm area overlapping\nthe hole ~lower region! at an average force 5 nN and with\nP50.7 mW. In both OHFM images the contrast between the\ntwo regions is clear: the averaged amplitude ratio r\n5Dz2 \/Dz1\u20191.3, and the averaged phase difference Df\n5f12f2\u201921\u00b0 ~where 1 and 2 correspond to the one- and\ntwo-layer regions, respectively, and f1,2 are phase leads!.\nThat r.1 is expected because of the higher thermal expan-\nsion coefficient of Al. The phase difference Df was found to\nbe independent, to within the experimental error ~63\u00b0!, of\nthe excitation conditions over the range probed ~see Fig. 2!.\nThe halo artifact between the two regions is caused by the\nslope and curvature of the sample there,12 and indicates a\nlateral resolution of a few nanometers. However, the effec-\ntive spatial resolution for thermal properties depends on the\nthermoelastically excited elastic stress distribution and its ef-\nfect on the surface displacement field.\nThe UFM image was obtained with the same tip and\naverage force by solely driving the cantilever base with a\nFIG. 3.

As a first approximation, we therefore compare our\nresults with a simple quasistatic one-dimensional ther-\nmoelastic model. The heat conduction equation, k]2T\/]z2\n5cr]T\/]t , is solved subject to the standard interfacial\nboundary conditions, where k is the thermal conductivity, c\nis the specific heat, and r is the density (z.0 regions!. The\nthermal diffusion length is given by m5(2k\/crv1)1\/2. As-\nsuming a surface-localized source, 2k1]T\/]z5I@11exp\n(2iv1t)# at z50, where I is the average absorbed\nlaser intensity (I\u2019P(12R)\/pD2), the surface vibration\nis derived from Dz exp@2i(v1t1f)#5*0\u2018(@11n(z)#\/@1\n2n(z)#)a(z)T(z,t)dz, where a(z) is the linear thermal expan-\nsion coefficient and n(z) is Poisson\u2019s ratio. Literature values\nof the required physical parameters are used.14,15,18\nThis allows the calculation of the sensitivity of the\nOHFM signals to variations in the thermal properties\nof the buried aluminum layer: We obtain d ln Dz2 \/d ln c5\n20.44, df2 \/d ln c55.7\u00b0, d ln Dz2 \/d ln a50.88, df2 \/d ln a\n520.69\u00b0, and d ln Dz2 \/d ln k520.001, df2 \/d ln k5\n20.03\u00b0, where c, a, and k refer here to aluminum. The\nunique feature of detection with thermal waves, namely the\nsensitivity to c, is therefore effective here.\nFurther, we predict r\u2019(30 pm)\/(4.4 pm)56.8 and Df\n\u20193.9\u00b0. Although these relative values have the same sign as\nin the experiment, they are significantly different. Possible\nreasons are; ~1! the finite optical penetration depth, ~2! the\nneglect of three-dimensional ~3D! heat diffusion, ~3! the ne-\nglect of thermal boundary resistances, and ~4! heating effects\nin the tip itself. We estimate that optical penetration has a\nnegligible influence since z!m . Preliminary estimates19 of\nthe effect of 3D heat diffusion on r suggest that this can\nreduce the amplitude contrast. The effect of thin-film thermal\nboundary resistance may also play a role.20 In addition, ther-\nmal expansion of the tip may contribute in general, although\nsimple arguments suggest that this effect is not significant in\nthe present case.21\nThe transition in the OHFM signals between regions of\ndifferent subsurface structure is remarkably sharp ~compared\nto m!, ;50 nm. When the optical excitation overlaps the two\nregions, a 3D numerical analysis of the thermoelastic prob-\nlem is clearly necessary to understand this lateral variation.\nThis is beyond the scope of this letter. However, the length\nscale responsible for these abrupt transitions is likely to be\nstrongly influenced here by the relatively small vertical ex-\ntent of the buried inhomogeneous region ~compared to m!. In\naddition, the change in surface topography will play a role\nbecause it impedes both lateral heat flow and lateral stress\ntransmission. Experiments with a series of related sample\ngeometries should help settle this point.Downloaded 03 Apr 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to In conclusion, we have demonstrated that subsurface\nthermal contrast on the submicron level can be locally\nmapped with a technique based on megahertz photothermal\nvibrations. The method in its present form should be invalu-\nable for the nondestructive testing of buried nanostructures\nsuch as in integrated circuits. Useful contrast from variations\nin surface optical properties remains to be explored. More-\nover, the potential for depth profiling by scanning the optical\nchopping frequency up to the 1 GHz range and beyond or by\nthe use of the pulsed optical pump and probe technique\nshould open the way to thermal tomography with thermal\nwaves of wavelengths down to the nanometer level, and aid\nin the study of the physics of diffusive phonon and electron\ntransport in quantum-confined geometries.\nThe authors are grateful to Osamu Matsuda, Roberto Li\nVoti, Katsuhiko Inagaki, and Naomi Kumano for helpful dis-\ncussions.\n1 A.
