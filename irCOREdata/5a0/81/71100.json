These findings\nare consistent with previously proposed mechanisms of solar\nwind modulation of the dayside reconnection rate.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Energetic particles,\nprecipitating; Magnetopause, cusp, and boundary layers)\n1 Introduction\nAs one of the primary mechanisms by which solar wind\nenergy, momentum and mass enter the terrestrial magneto-\nsphere, magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause\nis arguably the most significant factor influencing solar\nwind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. However, in the\ndecades since the \u201copen\u201d magnetosphere was first proposed\nby Dungey (1961) and the signatures of transient reconnec-\ntion were first observed in situ (Haerendel et al., 1978; Rus-\nsell and Elphic, 1978, 1979), debate has continued regarding\nthe likely location of the reconnection site(s) under given in-\nterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions.\nWhile magnetic reconnection is often described as oc-\ncurring at locations where the magnetospheric and mag-\nnetosheath fields are aligned in an anti-parallel orientation\n(Dungey, 1961), it is now generally accepted that reconnec-\ntion will occur at some location on the magnetopause for\nany IMF configuration. In the ubiquitous southward IMF\nparadigm, reconnection occurs at a line (often known as the\nreconnection \u201cX-line\u201d) spanning the dayside magnetopause\nalong the magnetic equator. Under IMF conditions with a\nstrong BY (dusk\u2013dawn) component, the X-line divides in the\nnoon sector producing two distinct reconnection lines, one in\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n220 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs\neach hemisphere (e.g. Crooker, 1979; Luhmann et al., 1984).\nAlternatively, it has been proposed that magnetic reconnec-\ntion can occur in the sub-solar region \u2013 the region where the\nmagnetosheath field first comes into contact with the magne-\ntopause \u2013 for almost any IMF orientation as long as there\nis a sufficiently large magnetic shear across the boundary\nand the IMF has a southward directed component (Gonzalez\nand Mozer, 1974). Such \u201ccomponent reconnection\u201d, X-lines\nwould be expected to pass through the sub-solar point and\nto be tilted relative to the equator. The orientation of the X-\nline is given by the bisector between the magnetosheath and\ngeomagnetic fields at the magnetopause.\nMore recently, investigations during intervals dominated\nby a strong IMF BY (dusk-dawn) component have revealed\nreconnection scenarios quite different from the traditional\nsouthward IMF paradigm (e.g. Fedorov et al., 2001). Mod-\nelling of solar wind plasma entry into the magnetosphere\nand ionosphere has lead to the development of the \u201cdouble\ncusp\u201d concept: one cusp at lower latitude near noon and\none cusp at higher latitude. Observational evidence for the\ndouble cusp comes mainly from low altitude satellite mea-\nsurements (e.g. Wing et al., 2001) with the double cusp\u2019s\nlatitudinal width and equatorward boundary apparently con-\ntrolled by the magnitude of the IMF BY component (Wing\net al., 2005). Meanwhile, reconnection on the flank magne-\ntopause (Khotyaintsev et al., 2004) and the combined effects\nof simultaneous dayside and lobe reconnection on magneto-\nspheric and ionospheric convection have also been reported\nunder strongly BY dominated IMF conditions (Sandholt and\nFarrugia, 2006).\nCombined space- and ground-based investigations have\nmade a significant contribution to our understanding of the\ndayside reconnection process (the reader is directed to Wild\net al., 2001; Amm et al., 2005, and references therein).\nSuch techniques are particularly useful since ground-based\nexperiments can measure the azimuthal extent of the X-\nline by tracking the ionospheric signatures of flux transfer,\nwhile space-based instruments can make detailed in situ mea-\nsurements of individual flux transfer events (FTEs). How-\never, it should be noted that the comparison of space- and\nground-based measurements relies upon accurate magnetic\nfield mapping between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.\nEven if the chosen magnetic field model is assumed to be\ntotally accurate, it is still necessary to examine low-altitude\nplasma measurements in order to estimate the distance of the\nmeasurement point from the reconnection site along the field\nline if the intention is to discriminate between a possible low,\nmid, or high latitude reconnection site (e.g. Trattner et al.,\n2006). Given the size of the dayside magnetopause and the\nsparsity of available satellites, accurately tracing a newly-\nopened flux tube back to the reconnection site from which\nit originated is a non-trivial undertaking.\nThe expected motion of newly-reconnected field lines\nemerging from either anti-parallel or component reconnec-\ntion X-lines have been modelled in 2-D by Cowley and\nOwen (1989) and in 3-D by Cooling et al. (2001). Recently,\nthese models have been used in conjunction with space- and\nground-based measurements in order to constrain the loca-\ntion of the X-line based upon the in situ and remotely-sense\nsignatures of reconnection (e.g. Dunlop et al., 2005; Wild\net al., 2005a). However, these studies have concentrated on\nintervals of southward oriented IMF \u2013 conditions when both\nthe anti-parallel and component reconnection descriptions of\nreconnection place the X-line in the vicinity of the sub-solar\ndayside magnetopause. Below, we shall consider the loca-\ntion of the reconnection X-line during a prolonged interval of\nrelatively steady duskward-pointing interplanetary magnetic\nfield. The observations shall be drawn from an interval on 25\nMarch 2004, data first summarised in Wild et al. (2005b) in\none of the first studies to exploit data from the Cluster and\nDouble Star satellite missions in coordination with ground-\nbased measurement. However, Wild et al. (2005b) failed to\nidentify the likely position of the reconnection site under the\nprevailing duskward IMF configuration, hence the motiva-\ntion for this re-investigation.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ESA Cluster mission (Escoubet et al., 1997, 2001)\ncomprises four identically instrumented satellites flying in\nclose formation in highly elliptical (19.7\/4.0RE) polar or-\nbits. Launched in 2000, this mission was augmented in\n2004\/5 by the launch of the ESA\/China National Space Ad-\nministration pair of Double Star satellites (Liu et al., 2005).\nThese spacecraft, instrumented with a subset of the Cluster\npayload, were injected into elliptical equatorial (14.5\/1.1RE)\nand polar (7.1\/1.1RE) orbits such that the Cluster and Dou-\nble Star orbital planes remain approximately aligned. During\nthe interval investigated below (25 March 2004), only the\nequatorial Double Star spacecraft was in operation.\nCluster and Double Star observations of the local magnetic\nfield, ion and electron populations employed in this study are\nprovided by the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM; see Balogh\net al., 1997, 2001; Carr et al., 2005), Cluster ion spectrom-\netry (CIS; see R\u00e8me et al., 1997, 2001, 2005), and plasma\nelectron and current (PEACE: see Johnstone et al., 1997;\nOwen et al., 2001; Fazakerley et al., 2005) experiments, re-\nspectively. The FGM data have been analysed at a temporal\nresolution equal to the spin period of the spacecraft (\u223c4 s for\nboth Cluster and Double Star). The CIS experiment mea-\nsures the three-dimensional ion distribution up to energies of\n\u223c38 keV\/e, yielding the total ion number density and veloc-\nity moments at spin resolution and full pitch angle distribu-\ntions every spin in the case of Cluster and every second spin\nin the case of Double Star. The PEACE instrument mea-\nsures the electron pitch angle distribution between energies\nof 0.7 eV\u201328 keV\/e, yielding the total electron number den-\nsity and velocity moments and gyrotropic electron pitch an-\ngle distributions at spin resolution.\nAnn.

Figure 1\nshows the motion of the Cluster and equatorial Double Star\nspacecraft during the interval 06:00\u201310:00 UT on 25 March\n2004. Throughout this paper, we shall refer to the four Clus-\nter spacecraft by using the abbreviations C1, C2, C3 and C4.\nSimilarly, we shall refer to the equatorial Double Star space-\ncraft by its designator, TC1. The left-hand panel presents\nthe location of the C1 and TC1 spacecraft at hourly inter-\nvals, projected into the GSM X-Z plane. The inset shows\nthe configuration of the four Cluster spacecraft at 08:00 UT\nwhen projected into the same plane. The right-hand panel\nshows the spacecraft projected in the GSM Y-Z plane dur-\ning the same interval. The location of a Shue et al.

Similarly, in\nthe right-hand panel, the radius of the magnetopause in the\nX=+8RE plane is shown corresponding to the approximate\nX position at which the Cluster spacecraft encountered the\nboundary). As indicated in Fig. 1, during this interval TC1\nwas moving on an trajectory which traversed the post-noon\nsector low latitude magnetopause, slightly southward of the\nGSM equatorial plane. Meanwhile, the quartet of Cluster\nspacecraft crossed the magnetopause on an outbound trajec-\ntory in the post-noon sector at higher northerly latitudes. As\nwe shall demonstrate below, the magnetopause crossings by\nTC1 and Cluster did not occur simultaneously; TC1 entered\nthe magnetopause just prior to \u223c07:00 UT while Cluster ex-\nited shortly before \u223c08:00 UT.\nIn situ observations of the solar wind and IMF were pro-\nvided by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) space-\ncraft (Stone et al., 1998), which was located \u223c225RE up-\nstream from the Earth. Magnetic field and plasma data are\nprovided by the magnetic fields (MAG) experiment (Smith\net al., 1998) and the solar wind electron, proton, and alpha\nmonitor (SWEPAM) (McComas et al., 1998), respectively.\nUnfortunately, during the interval of interest, no solar wind\nplasma density data were available from the SWEPAM in-\nstrument.\nFigure 2 shows the arrangement of the main ground-based\ninstruments used in this study presented in a magnetic lo-\ncal time\/magnetic latitude coordinate system. Specifically,\nthis figure shows the situation at 07:30 UT on 25 March\n2004. Ionospheric observations are drawn from elements\nof the SuperDARN array of coherent scatter radars (Green-\nwald et al., 1995) and the European Incoherent Scatter (EIS-\nCAT) radar association.

These radars transmit high-frequency (typi-\ncally 10\u201312 MHz) radio waves which are backscattered from\ndecametre-scale ionospheric electron density irregularities.\nIn addition to backscattered power, the line-of-sight (l-o-s)\nDoppler velocity and Doppler spectral width of backscat-\ntered signals are recorded simultaneously at two similar but\ndistinct frequencies (typically separated by a few tens of\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/ Ann.

The radial lines indicate hours of mag-\nnetic local time with noon located at the top of the figure. The sta-\ntistical location of the auroral oval for appropriate magnetic activity\nis also indicated (after Feldstein and Starkov, 1967).The fields-of-\nview of the CUTLASS pair of SuperDARN radars are superim-\nposed; the CUTLASS Finland radar in blue and the CUTLASS\nIceland radar in red. Within these fields-of-view, the high time\nresolution beams beams employed in this study are indicated by\ndot-dashed lines.

Thus, operating in this \u201cstereo\u201d mode (Lester et al.,\n2004), each CUTLASS radar scans its full 16-beam field-of-\nview (f-o-v) at 1 min cadence while simultaneously sounding\none beam at high (3 s) temporal resolution.\nThe EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR) facility at Longyear-\nbyen (Wannberg et al., 1997) consists of two separate co-\nlocated antennas. In this paper, we shall present 64 s reso-\nlution data from the steerable 32 m dish which operates at\nUHF frequencies \u223c500 MHz. During the interval of interest,\nthe antenna was directed northward at low elevation, with\na geographic azimuth of 336\u25e6 and an elevation of 30\u25e6. As\nsuch, the ESR beam was pointing along the local magnetic\nmeridian and almost aligned with the high temporal reso-\nlution beam of the CUTLASS Finland radar. Observations\nfrom the fixed, field-aligned 42 m ESR antenna, although\noperational, are not used in this paper. The location of the\nsite on the Svalbard archipelago is shown by the green dot\nin Fig. 2 while the direction of the beam between altitudes\n150\u2013500 km is indicated by the green line. The EISCAT\nVHF radar (Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993, and references\ntherein), located near Troms\u00f8 on the Scandinavian mainland,\nwas also operating on this day. The beam of the VHF radar,\noperating at \u223c224 MHz, was also directed northward at low\nelevation, with a geographic azimuth of 345\u25e6 and an eleva-\ntion of 30\u25e6 (i.e. pointing toward Svalbard) and yielded mea-\nsurements at 30 s resolution. The location of the radar and\nVHF beam between 150\u2013650 km altitude are also shown in\nFig. 2. Both radars used alternating code measurement tech-\nniques to provide profiles of electron density, electron and\nion temperature, and ion velocity along the line-of-sight.\nMagnetic field measurement are drawn from stations of\nthe International Monitor for Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE)\nmagnetometer network (L\u00fchr et al., 1998) and the UK Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET: Yeoman et al.,\n1990). Data from the Hella (Iceland), Hankasalmi (Fin-\nland) and Borok (Russia) stations, provided by SAMNET,\nare recorded at 1 s resolution while data from the IMAGE-\noperated Troms\u00f8 (Norway) and Ny \u00c5lesund (Svalbard) sta-\ntions are recorded at 10 s resolution. The location of four of\nthese stations (labelled with the three-letter identifiers HLL,\nHAN, TRO and NAL respectively) are indicated by crosses\nin Fig. 2. The other station, Borok (BOR), is located at\n54.14\u25e6 magnetic latitude \u223c10\u25e6 of longitude east of the Han-\nkasalmi station and therefore does not appear in Fig. 2.\n3 Observations\nIn this section, we shall introduce the various data exploited\nin this study. First we shall present the upstream observations\nof the solar wind and IMF, followed by in-situ observations\nof FTEs in the vicinity of the magnetopause. Finally, data\nrecorded by ground-based experiments will be shown. Data\nfirst presented by Wild et al. (2005b) (hereafter referred to as\nPaper 1) will thus be augmented by new in-situ and remotely-\nsensed measurements.\n3.1 Upstream solar wind observations\nFigure 3 presents an overview of solar wind and IMF obser-\nvations made by the ACE spacecraft. As described in Pa-\nper 1, these data have been lagged by 80 min such in order\nto take into account the propagation of solar wind\/IMF struc-\nture from the spacecraft to the magnetopause. Throughout\nthe 06:00\u201310:00 UT interval, the positive IMF BY compo-\nnent dominated while theBZ component was generally small\nand positive, with only three brief southward excursions at\n\u223c06:15,\u223c08:25 and\u223c08:35 UT (lagged time). This resulted\nin a generally duskward and northward oriented IMF clock\nangle. During the entire interval, theBX component was neg-\native (i.e. Earthward pointing). The bulk solar wind speed\nwas typically \u223c350 km s\u22121 but fluctuating by approximately\n\u00b110 km s\u22121.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 219\u2013238, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/\nJ.

In the case of the PEACE data,\nthe spectrogram corresponds to electrons travelling parallel\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 219\u2013238, 2007\n224 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs\nto the local field direction. For CIS, only data correspond-\ning to all ion pitch angles were available. Ion velocity and\ndensity moments derived from CIS data are also shown.\nAt the beginning of the interval, the TC1 spacecraft was\nlocated in the magnetosheath. The IMF clock angle was very\nsimilar to that observed by the ACE spacecraft some 225RE\nupstream of the Earth when lagged as described above.\nPlasma measurements indicated a magnetosheath-like par-\nticle population characterised by a dense (\u223c20 ions cm\u22123)\nbut cool plasma (peak ion energy <1 keV). Just prior to\n06:50 UT, TC1 entered a boundary layer in which the mag-\nnetic field clock angle deviated from the upstream orientation\nand rotated toward the magnetospheric field direction (\u223c0\u25e6).\nSimultaneously, the observed ion density dropped by \u223c50%\nwhile the upper-energy cutoff of the local electron and ion\npopulations approximately doubled. At 06:50 UT, TC1 en-\ncountered a region of predominantly dawnward ion flow in\nexcess of 100 km s\u22121 that lasted for \u223c1 min. Prior to the ob-\nservation of this feature, the observed plasma flow speed was\n\u223c50 km s\u22121 and directed predominantly southward and anti-\nsunward, as expected from TC1\u2019s location just south of the\nsubsolar point. Based upon clock angle data only (as in Pa-\nper 1), the time of entry into the magnetosphere had been\ndetermined to be 06:50 UT. Taking into account the plasma\ndata now available, we infer that the spacecraft actually en-\ntered a boundary layer at 06:50 UT and moved into the mag-\nnetosphere proper during the latter part of the interval.\nWhile in the boundary layer, between \u223c06:50\u201307:16 UT,\nthe ion density observed at TC1 varied between 2\u2013\n30 ions cm\u22123. Reductions in plasma density (<5 ions cm\u22123)\nwere accompanied by significant decreases in the flux of\nions with energies <0.5 keV and an increase in the flux\nof >2 keV ions. These plasma density\/energy features co-\nincided with the largest deviations of the magnetic field\nclock angle from the upstream orientation (75\u25e6\u201390\u25e6) toward\nthe magnetospheric orientation (\u223c0\u25e6). We therefore inter-\npret these variations as symptoms of the spacecraft\u2019s posi-\ntion within the boundary layer relative the to magnetopause\nwhich was, presumably, moving in response to the upstream\nsolar wind and IMF conditions.\nAt 07:16 UT, TC1 entered a region in which the ion den-\nsity was <1 ion cm\u22123, ion and electron energies extended\nup to \u223c10 keV and the local magnetic field was oriented\nin a northward direction. This transition from a cool\/dense\nplasma to a hot\/tenuous plasma marked TC1\u2019s entry into the\nmagnetosphere. Over the next 10 min, TC1 rapidly traversed\nthe magnetopause four times (two outbound and two inbound\ncrossing), entering the magnetosphere for the final time at\n07:25 UT.\nWhile in the boundary layer (06:59\u201307:16 UT), TC1 en-\ncountered a series of magnetic field perturbations. More\nspecifically, numerous bipolar fluctuations in the component\nof the magnetic field normal to local magnetopause with\npeak-to-peak amplitude \u223c10 nT were observed. Examples\ninclude those at 06:52, 07:06, 07:07 and 07:08 UT. These\nare reminiscent of the classic bipolar FTE signatures first re-\nported by Russell and Elphic (1978) and numerous authors\nsince. However, due to the highly variable nature of the mag-\nnetic field in this boundary layer region, care must be taken\nin identifying possible FTE signature. As such, only bipo-\nlar signatures that are accompanied by local enhancements\nin the overall magnetic field strength and indications of mag-\nnetosheath\/magnetosphere plasma mixing will be considered\nfurther. Two bipolar perturbations meet these criteria and are\nindicated by the dashed red lines in Fig. 4 (labelled \u201cFTE i\u201d\n(\u223c07:07 UT) and \u201cFTE ii\u201d (\u223c07:08 UT) respectively). In\neach case, the overall magnetic field strength exhibits a clear\nlocal maximum as the bipolar BN component perturbation\ngoes through 0 nT from positive to negative values \u2013 indi-\ncating that these are \u201cnormal\u201d polarity perturbations (Russell\nand Elphic, 1978, 1979) accompanied by low fluxes of mag-\nnetospheric electrons in the 0.5\u20132 keV range.\nFigure 5 presents equivalent field and plasma data\nrecorded by the Cluster 1 (C1) spacecraft during the inter-\nval 07:45\u201308:45 UT (i.e. shortly after the interval presented\nin Fig. 4). At this time, the Cluster spacecraft were situ-\nated at approximately the same magnetic local time as the\nDouble Star satellite, but at much higher latitude, as shown\nin Fig. 1. At 07:45 UT, the start of the interval shown\nin Fig. 5, Cluster 1 was located within the magnetosphere.\nThe northward and duskward pointing magnetic field (\u223c20\u25e6\nclock angle) is consistent with the spacecraft\u2019s location in\nthe high-latitude, pre-noon sector magnetosphere. CIS and\nPEACE plasma measurements indicate that the spacecraft\nwas surrounded by hot, tenuous magnetospheric plasma. Just\nprior to 07:50 UT, C1 entered a boundary layer in which the\nion density increased dramatically, as did fluxes of lower\nenergy (\u223c100 eV) electrons and ions. Over the follow-\ning 12 min, the spacecraft observed bursts of high electron\nand ion fluxes in the <0.5 keV and 20 eV\u20132 keV ranges re-\nspectively accompanied by up to forty-fold increases in the\nion density. The ion flow velocity, which prior to entering\nthe boundary layer had been duskward and southward with\nspeed \u223c50 km s\u22121, increased with peak velocities in excess\nof 100 km s\u22121 and was highly variable (in both speed and\ndirection). The magnetopause boundary layer was neither\nuniform or stationary. During traversal of the layer (or lay-\ners), several distinct plasma regions were encountered, no-\ntably regions characterised by the magnetospheric plasma\nonly (e.g., \u223c07:56:30 UT), regions characterised by the\nmagnetosheath plasma only (e.g. \u223c07:52 and \u223c07:58 UT)\nand regions with mixed magnetosheath and magnetospheric\nplasma, (e.g. \u223c07:57:00 UT).\nAt about 08:01 UT, Cluster 1 was engulfed by dense\n(\u223c25 ions cm\u22123) cool plasma as it entered the magnetosheath\nproper. After this time, the magnetic field clock angle orien-\ntation was generally in good agreement with the (lagged) up-\nstream observations and the ion flow directed predominantly\nantisunward and northward. We note that the PEACE in-\nstrument switch off at 08:30 UT and the CIS experiment was\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 219\u2013238, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs 225\ninactive for 2 brief intervals (centred on 08:56 and 08:31 UT)\nresulting in short data gaps. After 08:32 UT, the CIS instru-\nment operated at a reduced temporal resolution of 24 s (com-\npared to 4 s resolution before this time).\nTurning now to the Cluster 1 BN component magnetic\nfield data, several bipolar fluctuations were observed dur-\ning the interval presented in Fig. 5. As was the case with\nTC1 data, we shall concentrate our attention on bipolar BN\nperturbations that are accompanied by clear enhancement\nin the overall magnetic field strength and evidence of mag-\nnetospheric\/magnetosheath plasma mixing. As such, we\nhave identified six events for further study, namely those at\n08:20, 08:24, 08:27, 08:29, 08:32, and 08:35 UT (labelled\n\u201cFTE a\u2013f \u201d respectively). While FTEs e and f fall outside\nthe PEACE data coverage, there is some evidence in the\nlower resolution CIS data of plasma mixing. These excep-\ntionally clear magnetic signatures are therefore included in\nthe subsequent analysis. Bipolar BN component perturba-\ntions were also observed in the regions dominated by magne-\ntosheath plasma (e.g. \u223c07:52 and \u223c07:58 UT) as the space-\ncraft passed through the boundary layer. Indeed, in Pa-\nper 1 these events were identified as likely FTEs (based on\nmagnetic field data alone). However, given the provision\nof plasma measurements which place these FTE candidates\nwithin the complex magnetopause boundary layer, it is diffi-\ncult to uphold this inference with reasonable confidence. As\nsuch, these events shall not be considered further below.\n3.3 Ionospheric observations\nFigure 6 presents backscattered power, l-o-s Doppler ve-\nlocity and Doppler spectral widths measured by the CUT-\nLASS Finland SuperDARN radar during the period 05:00\u2013\n09:00 UT on 25 March 2005. More specifically, these data\nwere recorded along beam 9, the single beam sounded by\nthe high time resolution (3 s) channel of the Finland radar\n(as indicated in Fig. 2). The measured parameters associated\nwith ionospheric echoes are colour-coded according to the\ncolour scale to the right of each panel. As shown in Fig. 2,\nthis beam of the Finland radar is approximately aligned\nwith the magnetic meridian. Thus, positive (negative) ve-\nlocity measurements correspond to flow toward (away) from\nthe radar in an roughly equatorward (poleward) direction.\nBackscattered signals that have been identified as ground\nscatter (Vl\u2212o\u2212s<50 m s\u22121 and spectral width <100 m s\u22121)\nare shaded grey in the line-of-sight velocity panel.\nAt 05:00 UT, the Finland radar observed a region of iono-\nspheric backscatter extending\u223c4\u25e6 poleward of 79\u25e6 magnetic\nlatitude. This ionospheric scatter was superimposed upon\nan area of ground-scatter echoes spanning the entire latitu-\ndinal range presented in the figure. However, over the course\nof the following three hours, the latitudinal extent of the\nband of ionospheric backscatter gradually decreased until, by\n08:00 UT, it had almost entirely disappeared. This is clearest\nin the centre panel of Fig. 6 which presents the l-o-s iono-\nFig. 5. Field and plasma measurements from the Cluster 1 space-\ncraft between 07:45\u201308:45.

These are clearly visible as areas\nof high backscattered power moving away from the radar to-\nward higher latitudes. Dashed lines have been overlaid on the\nbackscattered power and velocity panels of Fig. 6 to empha-\nsise these features. The poleward speed of these structures,\ncomputed by tracking the motion of each high power echo\nfeatures over a few-minute interval and corresponding to the\nslopes of the dashed lines, varies between 0.8\u20131.5 km s\u22121. In\ngeneral these poleward-moving regions are associated with\na relatively large l-o-s velocity component (>500 m s\u22121) di-\nrected away from the radar. However, strong equatorward\nflows (toward the radar) are also observed, although these are\ngenerally short-lived and occur in the lower latitude portion\nof the ionospheric backscatter.\nFig. 7.

Line-\nof-sight velocity time-series from range gates 23 and 28 are overlaid\nat the appropriate latitudes.\nThe poleward moving structures are very similar to the\n\u201cpulsed ionospheric flows\u201d (PIFs) reported by Pinnock et al.\n(1995) and Provan et al. (1998) \u2013 now widely accepted as the\nionospheric signatures of FTEs. They correspond to regions\nof high speed ionospheric plasma flow at the footprint of\nnewly-reconnected magnetic flux tubes as they are dragged\naway from the reconnection site by the combined action of\nsolar wind flow and magnetic tension. In this case, the PIFs\nare observed in the region westward (dawnward) and pole-\nward of the footprint of the TC1 and C1 satellite.\nFigure 7 shows the corresponding measurements along the\nhigh time resolution beam (beam 5) of the CUTLASS Ice-\nland SuperDARN radar. This beam points in a more zonal\ndirection than the equivalent high time resolution beam of\nthe Finland radar. Thus, whereas velocity measurements\ntoward\/away from the Finland radar roughly correspond\nto equatorward\/poleward motion, equivalent measurements\nmade by the Iceland radar contain a significant east-west\ncomponent.

Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs 227\ndirected away from the radar, i.e. poleward and eastward,\nwere observed. As such, the velocity colour scale differs\nfrom that employed in Fig. 6.\nIn contrast to the measurements from the Finland radar,\nthe backscattered signals received by the Iceland radar orig-\ninated from much lower latitudes \u2013 typically equatorward\nof 76\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Within this region of backscat-\nter, the l-o-s velocity fluctuated between approximately +200\nand \u2212700 m s\u22121 with a periodicity of \u223c10 min. In order to\nemphasise these fluctuations, l-o-s velocity time-series have\nbeen extracted from range gates 23 and 28 are overlaid on\nthe line-of-sight velocity panel of Fig. 7. In each case, a\ndashed line indicates the latitude of the relevant range gate\nand the 0 m s\u22121 level. In keeping with the underlying plot,\npositive\/poleward velocities are above the dashed line while\nnegative\/equatorward velocities are below. The deflection of\nthe trace corresponding to a 500 m s\u22121 velocity is also shown.\nThese measurements indicate a pulsing of the ionospheric\nflow in the poleward and eastward direction with a period-\nicity in the ultra-low frequency (ULF) range.\nThe CUTLASS radar measurements can be placed into\ncontext by considering the large scale ionospheric convec-\ntion pattern that characterised the interval. Figure 8 shows\nthe ionospheric convection pattern in Northern Hemisphere\nderived from ionospheric plasma velocity measurements us-\ning the \u201cmap potential\u201d technique of Ruohoniemi and Baker\n(1998). This technique yields large-scale global convection\nmaps from the l-o-s velocity measurements from 9 North-\nern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars, via mathematical fitting\nof the data to an expansion of the electrostatic potential in\nspherical harmonics. Firstly, the l-o-s data are filtered and\nthen mapped onto a polar grid. These \u201cgridded\" measure-\nments are then used to determine a solution for the electro-\nstatic potential distribution that is most consistent with the\navailable measurements. The electric potentials of the solu-\ntion then represent the plasma streamlines of the modelled\nconvection pattern. As backscatter targets (and therefore l-o-\ns velocity measurements) are not always available, informa-\ntion from the statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald\n(1996), parameterised by IMF conditions, is used to stabilise\nthe solution where no measurements are made. In this case,\nthe convection maps have been produced from ionospheric\nflow measurements averaged over 10 min. This temporal av-\neraging is necessary in this case since there were generally\ninsufficient l-o-s data in each individual radar scan (\u223c1 min)\nto satisfactorily constrain the solution for the electrostatic po-\ntential.\nFigure 8 presents the ionospheric convection pattern at\n07:10, 07:30 and 08:30 UT overlaid on the CUTLASS radar\nfields-of-view (as presented in Fig. 2). These times have been\nchosen as they correspond to the period during which the\nTC1 and Cluster spacecraft observed the field and particle\nsignatures of FTEs in the vicinity of the low and high lati-\ntude dayside magnetopause, respectively.

The dark\ngrey dots indicate locations where radar l-o-s velocity data\nare available (most of them measured by SuperDARN radars\nwhose fields-of-view are not included in the figure). The flow\nvectors drawn from these dots, sometimes referred to as \u201ctrue\nvectors\", are calculated by combining the measured l-o-s ve-\nlocity and the component of the convection flow (from the\nfitted solution) that is orthogonal to the l-o-s direction (i.e.\nthe radar beam) at each location. As in Fig. 2, the magnetic\nfootprints of the TC1 and C1 spacecraft are also indicated for\ncomparison.\nThroughout the interval discussed in this paper, the global\nionospheric convection pattern was dominated by the dusk\nconvection cell, as expected for the prevailing IMF BY pos-\nitive conditions (Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). The PIFs\npresented in Fig. 6 are located within the 77\u201383\u25e6 region\nof the CUTLASS Finland radar beam indicated by the dot-\ndashed lines within the blue field-of-view in Fig. 8. Based\nupon the 10-min averaged convection maps, this region cor-\nresponds to the \u201cthroat\u201d of the ionospheric flow pattern,\ndawnward of the location of the TC1 and C1 footprints.\nThus, the PIFs presented in Fig. 6 are consistent with the\nexpected motion of poleward and dawnward moving iono-\nspheric plasma associated with the newly-opened flux tubes\nproduced by the FTEs observed at the Cluster and Double\nStar spacecraft.\nNote that within the Finland radar\u2019s high time resolution\nbeam, the ionospheric flow direction is predominantly di-\nrected across the beam, rather than along the l-o-s direction.\nAs such, relatively small reorientations in flow direction will\nresult in a switch between l-o-s flow toward\/away from the\nradar. With this in mind, we interpret the short bursts of flow\ndirected towards the radar presented in Fig. 6 as short-lived,\nspatially localised distortions of the average convection pat-\nterns presented in Fig. 8 resulting from the appendage of re-\ngions of newly-opened magnetic flux to the polar cap follow-\ning a burst of dayside reconnection (e.g. Cowley and Lock-\nwood, 1992). An examination of the l-o-s velocities mea-\nsured along beam 6 of the Finland radar (not shown) supports\nthis interpretation. Beam 6 points into the throat of the iono-\nspheric convection pattern shown in Fig. 8 such that plasma\nflow streamlines have a substantial component parallel to the\nl-o-s direction. Although PIFs were observed in this beam,\nwith structures moving away from the radar at speeds com-\nparable to those discussed above, short-lived bursts of flow\nwith a l-o-s component towards the radar were not recorded\nsince small changes in the ionospheric flow pattern did not\nresult in a directional switch of the l-o-s velocity component.\nFigure 9 shows the simultaneous measurement of iono-\nspheric electron density, ion temperature and ion velocity\nrecorded by the EISCAT Svalbard radar. Although span-\nning a similar latitudinal range as the data presented in Fig. 6,\nthe ESR\u2019s low elevation beam was not exactly aligned with\nbeam 9 of the CUTLASS radar. At the 80\u25e6 magnetic lati-\ntude parallel, the CUTLASS and ESR beams are separated\nby around 60 km (3\u25e6 longitude), increasing to around 85 km\n(5\u25e6 longitude) at 82\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Nevertheless, the\nESR data reveals a highly structured ionosphere in the throat\nof the ionospheric convection pattern with poleward mov-\ning structures very similar to those observed by the CUT-\nLASS Finland radar. Like the CUTLASS radar, the ESR\nobserved almost exclusively poleward plasma flow through-\nout the interval presented. Between 05:30\u201307:03 UT sev-\neral high-speed PIFs were observed and were associated with\npoleward moving electron density enhancements. These cor-\nrespond well with the PIFs observed by the CUTLASS Fin-\nland radar. Indeed, if the dashed lines from Fig. 6 are overlaid\nonto the top panel of Fig. 9 and shifted in time for 3 min in\norder to allow for a few-minute zonal propagation delay be-\ntween the CUTLASS and ESR radar beams (equating to a\nzonal propagation speed of \u223c0.5 km s\u22121), then this excellent\nagreement is apparent. These data support the interpretation\nabove that the PIFs are the signature of magnetic reconnec-\ntion (i.e. FTEs), the poleward moving regions of enhanced\nelectron density corresponding to the ionospheric footprint of\nAnn.

Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs 229\nnewly-reconnected flux tubes down which plasma originat-\ning the magnetosheath is precipitating into the ionosphere.\nThese regions of high-speed (>500 m s\u22121) poleward plasma\nflow are also associated with region of enhanced ion tem-\nperature due to the relative velocity between the ions and\nthe neutral atmosphere enhancing the temperature of the F-\nregion ion population via ion-frictional heating (e.g. Davies\net al., 1997, 1999).\nAs an aside, we note that after \u223c07:30 UT the l-o-s ion\nvelocity measured by the ESR across the latitude range pre-\nsented in Fig. 9 dropped dramatically. The simultaneous\ndrop in the ion temperature suggests that this was a gen-\nuine decrease in the ionospheric flow speed rather than a\nredirection of the flow orthogonal to the radar beam since\nhigh speed flow across the beam (i.e. with little or no l-\no-s component) would still result in ion-frictional heating\nand elevated ion temperatures. By \u223c08:30 UT, about the\ntime that Cluster observed FTEs in the high-latitude mag-\nnetosheath, high speed poleward directed flows were ob-\nserved once again. Simultaneously, electron density struc-\ntures were observed drifting towards and away from the radar\nat \u223c200 m s\u22121. As indicated in Fig. 8, at 08:30 UT the ESR\nbeam pointed into the anti-sunward flow region of the dusk\nconvection cell. We therefore interpret the ESR observation\nof PIFs after \u223c08:00 UT as further signatures of pulsed re-\nconnection. The motion of the enhanced electron density fea-\ntures was most likely due to the meridional movement of the\ndawn-dusk ionospheric flow region across the pre-noon sec-\ntor in response to the changes in the polar cap size resulting\nfrom ongoing dayside reconnection. There is some evidence\nof similar equatorward moving structures in backscattered\npower recorded by the Finland radar after 07:30 UT (Fig. 6).\nHowever, these structures are generally associated with very\nlow l-o-s Doppler velocity and classified as ground scatter\nand there is insufficient ionospheric backscatter to make a\ndetailed comparison with the ESR observations at this time.\nFigure 10 shows the simultaneous measurements of elec-\ntron density, ion temperature and ion velocity over the 69\u2013\n75\u25e6 range made by the EISCAT VHF radar situated in\nTroms\u00f8. As shown in Fig. 8, the VHF beam is oriented\nslightly eastward of a meridional pointing direction, there-\nfore the generally negative l-o-s velocities observed (i.e. flow\naway from the radar) correspond to poleward and eastward\ndirected flows. Like the CUTLASS Iceland radar, these mea-\nsurements come from the region equatorward of the PIFs ob-\nserved by the ESR and the CUTLASS Finland radars. Fur-\nthermore, like the Iceland radar, the EISCAT VHF system\nobserved fluctuations in the ionospheric flow velocity in the\nULF frequency range. The velocity fluctuations can clearly\nbe seen in the time-series of l-o-s velocity overlaid on the ion\nvelocity panel. In this case, fluctuations of\u223c5 min period are\nsuperimposed on a longer period (\u223c40 min) and there is ev-\nidence of poleward phase propagation of the shorter period\nwave signatures.

In order to do this, we\nhave employed a realistic model of open flux tube motion\nbased on that of Cooling et al. (2001) (subsequently referred\nto as \u201cthe Cooling model\"). This simple model, an evolu-\ntion of the model of Cowley and Owen (1989), considers the\ndraping and strength of the magnetosheath magnetic field,\nmagnetosheath flow velocity, and density over the surface of\na simple paraboloid magnetopause, based upon the models\nof Kobel and Fl\u00fcckiger (1994) and Spreiter et al. (1966). For\ngiven IMF and solar wind parameters, the model computes\nthe instantaneous flux tube motion along the magnetopause\nat every point on the magnetopause surface due to the effects\nof stress balance in the reconnected flux tubes and magne-\ntosheath flow, at the so-called de Hoffman-Teller velocity\n(de Hoffman and Teller, 1950). From this, the motion of\nopen magnetic flux tubes threading the magnetopause can be\ntraced, via iteration, over the surface of the magnetopause\nand into the magnetotail from any location on the surface\nof the magnetopause. As a by-product of the de Hoffman-\nTeller velocity computation, the model also calculates the\nplasma velocity in the magnetopause boundary layer at all\npoints on the surface of the magnetosphere (see Cowley and\nOwen, 1989, and references therein).\nThe first comparison between estimates of flux tube mo-\ntion derived from the Cooling model and 3-D measurements\nof flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nwere presented by Wild et al. (2005a) and a similar analy-\nsis shall be employed here. In this modified implementation\nof the Cooling model, no steady-state reconnection test is\napplied. Instead, we shall monitor the subsequent motion of\nthe newly-opened flux tubes (i.e. FTEs) away from a user-\ndefined reconnection site. By doing this, we are able to com-\npare the expected flux tube motion with the observed FTE\nsignatures without making any assumptions regarding the\nnecessary conditions\/thresholds required for reconnection.\nFirst, we shall investigate the inbound passage through\nthe boundary layer and magnetopause made by the Double\nStar TC1 spacecraft at \u223c07:00 UT. Figures 12a\u2013c present\nthe estimates of boundary layer and flux tube motion at this\ntime derived from the Cooling model. Each panel of Fig. 12\nshows a view of the dayside magnetopause in the GSM Y-Z\nplane as viewed from the Sun. The concentric dotted circles\nindicate the magnetopause in the GSM Y-Z plane at X po-\nsitions of X=+5RE , 0RE , \u22125RE , and \u221210RE while the\ncusps are represented by the diamond symbol. In this model,\nthe cusps are positioned at the GSM locations [0.5RMP ,\n0, \u00b1RMP ] where RMP is the radius of the model magne-\ntopause at the subsolar point. In this case, RMP has been\nset to 10RE , roughly the value predicted by the model of\nShue et al. (1997) during this interval and consistent with the\nmagnetopause location observed by the spacecraft. The pre-\nvailing IMF clock angle is indicated in the upper right-hand\ncorner of each panel and the locations of the C1 and TC1\nspacecraft in the GSM Y-Z plane are indicated by filled circle\nand star symbols, respectively.\nIn Figs. 12a and b, a reconnection X-line has been initiated\nat the sub-solar point and extended 5RE in the directions\nparallel and anti-parallel to the local magnetopause current\n(a function of the relative orientation of the magnetospheric\nand magnetosheath field at any given location). The coloured\narrows show streamlines of boundary layer flow (Fig. 12a)\nand open flux tube motion (Fig. 12b) resulting from such\nAnn.

Blue (red) dashed arrows indicate boundary\nlayer flow and flux tube motion associated with flux tubes\nanchored in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere ionosphere.\nAs such, Fig. 12a shows the boundary layer flow from a sub-\nsolar X-line, tilted in the direction of the magnetopause cur-\nrent, for the IMF conditions observed at 06:50 UT (lagged\ntime). This corresponds to the approximate time that TC1\nencountered the magnetopause boundary layer as shown in\nFig. 4. Figure 12b shows the motion of open flux tubes from\nthe equivalent X-line at 07:05 UT, the approximate time at\nwhich TC1 observed FTE signatures as it approached the\nmagnetosphere. For comparison, Fig. 12c shows the open\nflux tube motion expected from a pair X-lines constrained to\npass through locations where the magnetosheath and mag-\nnetospheric magnetic field are with 1\u25e6 of anti-parallel, using\nIMF parameters appropriate for 07:05 UT (as in Fig. 12b).\nThus, Fig. 12a indicates that a tilted X-line passing\nthrough the sub-solar point would be located slightly south-\nward of the TC1 spacecraft at 06:50 UT (the time at which\nTC1 entered the boundary layer). The boundary layer plasma\nflow at this location is expected to be predominantly west-\nward (dawnward). The average boundary layer plasma flow\ndirection measured by the CIS instrument on TC1 between\n06:50\u201306:51 UT is indicated by a black arrow originating\nat the location of the spacecraft in Fig. 12a (for completeness\nthe inset shows the individual measurements that make up the\naverage boundary layer plasma flow vector). Clearly, there\nis excellent directional agreement between the observed and\nmodelled boundary layer plasma flow at this location\/time.\nThese velocities are also summarised in Table 1. Closer ex-\namination reveals that the Cooling model is over-estimating\nthe boundary layer flow speed, whereas the flow direction\nin the GSM Y-Z plane (roughly equivalent to the plane of\nthe magnetopause at this location) is in good agreement\nwith observations. However, the Sunward flowing plasma\nobserved by TC1 in the boundary layer is unexpected and\nnot described by the Cooling model.

A summary of the measured and modelled boundary layer and flux tube velocities presented in Fig. 12.\n(colour-coded blue) from a tilted sub-solar X-line would\nbe dragged over the TC1 spacecraft under the prevailing\nBY dominated IMF conditions. While no measurement of\nflux tube velocity are available from the single TC1 space-\ncraft, the fact that flux tubes attached to the Northern (rather\nthan Southern) Hemisphere are expected to pass over the\nTC1 spacecraft is consistent with the observation of nor-\nmal (rather than reverse) polarity FTEs in the Double Star\nmagnetometer data just after 07:05 UT (e.g. Rijnbeek et al.,\n1984). Figure 12c illustrates that under these IMF condi-\ntions, anti-parallel magnetic field configurations are to be\nfound tailward and duskward (dawnward) of the northern\n(southern) cusp regions. In these regions of super-Alfv\u00e9nic\nmagnetosheath flow, reconnected flux tubes are dragged tail-\nward, away from the location of the Double Star TC1 space-\ncraft. We therefore suggest that the FTE signatures ob-\nserved by TC1 originated at a low-latitude X-line, as shown\nin Fig. 12a\/b, rather than a high latitude site, as shown in\nFig. 12c. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that\nhigh latitude reconnection is occurring during this interval,\nbut these processes are unlikely to account for the observed\nFTEs. Furthermore, we note that at the high-latitude sites\n(Fig. 12c), newly-opened flux tubes originating in both hemi-\nspheres are dragged tailward such that in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, Southern Hemisphere field lines are dragged north-\nward back across the reconnection site (and vice-versa). Un-\nder such conditions, steady reconnection would be impossi-\nble (Cowley and Owen, 1989) \u2013 any reconnection at these\nsites must be bursty in nature. For completeness, mid-\nlatitude reconnection sites on the dusk\/dawn flanks were also\ninvestigated. As in the high-latitude case, super-Alfv\u00e9nic\nmagnetosheath flow carried such flux tubes tailward, away\nfrom the Double Star and Cluster spacecraft located in the\nnoon sector.\nFigures 12d\u2013f show equivalent comparisons between ob-\nservations made by the Cluster spacecraft and the Cooling\nmodel. Figure 12d shows the expected boundary layer flow\nstreamlines at 07:55 UT, corresponding to the time at which\nC1 was embedded within the magnetopause boundary layer.\nOverlaid on these is an arrow indicating the plasma flow di-\nrection at C1 derived from CIS ion moments averaged be-\ntween 07:55\u201307:56 UT (repeated in Table 1). Once again, we\nnote that there is good agreement between the direction of the\nobserved and estimated flow direction in the GSM Y-Z plane,\nalthough the flow speed has been overestimated by the Cool-\ning model. A significant discrepancy in the VX component of\nthe boundary layer plasma flow is observed in this case also.\nGiven the multi-spacecraft measurements available at the lo-\ncation of Cluster, it is possible to estimate the velocity of FTE\nstructures as they pass by the spacecraft based upon a timing\nanalysis of the structure as it advects over each satellite (e.g.\nDunlop and Woodward, 1998). Figure 12e presents the es-\ntimated motion of open flux tubes from an X-line passing\nthrough the sub-solar point under the almost purely dawn-\nward IMF conditions as observed at 08:35 UT (lagged time).\nThis corresponds to the time at which the final FTE was ob-\nserved by Cluster (\u201cFTE f\u201d in Fig. 5). The estimated direc-\ntion of the FTE observed by Cluster at this time \u2013 derived via\nmulti-spacecraft timing analysis - is overlaid at the appropri-\nate location of the C1 spacecraft (the corresponding veloc-\nity components are presented in Table 1). As with bound-\nary layer flow comparison, there is very good agreement be-\ntween the direction of motion in GSM Y-Z plane observed by\nCluster and that predicted by the Cooling model. Again, the\nflow speed is overestimated by the model and there is poor\nagreement between the observed and modelled VX compo-\nnent (which at this location points roughly outward from the\nmagnetopause). The velocity estimated from the multi-point\nCluster data is based upon the assumption that the FTE can\nbe approximated to a planar structure \u2013 the resulting velocity\nestimate will be directed orthogonally to the planer surface.\nIf we interpret the bipolar BN signature of an FTE as a bulge\non the surface of the magnetopause, it is not unreasonable to\nexpect planarity over the Cluster tetrahedron (\u223cfew 100 km\nscale size). However, as the bulge moves over the surface of\nthe magnetopause, the normal to its leading edge will point\noutward from the magnetosphere. We therefore interpret the\napparent outward motion of the structure that the Cluster\nsatellites have measured as the motion of the FTE \u201cbulge\u201d\npast the tetrahedron as it moves over the surface of the mag-\nnetopause. This is not described by the Cooling model which\nsimply indicates the motion of the newly-opened flux tube in\nthe plane of the magnetopause. For completeness, we have\nagain considered the location of regions of anti-parallel mag-\nnetosheath and magnetospheric field at 08:35 UT and the mo-\ntion of open flux tubes that might be created by reconnection\nin these regions (Fig. 12f). As was the case at 07:05 UT,\nthe BY dominated IMF forces these regions to high latitudes,\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 219\u2013238, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs 233\ntailward of the cusps. We suggest that reconnection in these\nregions would (i) be unlikely to launch newly-opened flux\ntubes towards the Cluster spacecraft and (ii) is unlikely to be\nsteady.\nThe ground-based data presented above support the inter-\npretation that the FTE signatures are the consequence of a\nlow-latitude X-line. For a low latitude reconnection site, we\nhave shown that newly opened flux tubes would be expected\nto engulf both the C1 and TC1 spacecraft as they are dragged\ndawnward. The ionospheric footprint of such flux tubes\nwould be expected to move dawnward and tailward as they\nwere dragged into the polar cap under the effects of magnetic\ntension and magnetosheath flow \u2013 just as presented in Fig. 8.\nThe global ionospheric convection pattern derived from Su-\nperDARN data indicates that plasma newly-reconnected flux\ntubes convect poleward and dawnward away from the foot-\nprint of the C1\/TC1 spacecraft which, given their proxim-\nity to the dayside magnetopause, are presumably located on\nthe equatorward edge of the cusp. The high-speed flow as-\nsociated with newly reconnected flux tubes as they crossed\nthe cusp and moved into the polar cap gave rise to the PIFs\nobserved by the CUTLASS Finland SuperDARN radar and\nthe EISCAT Svalbard radar. Whereas both of these radars\nobserved the high latitude ionosphere poleward of Svalbard\n(magnetic latitudes between 77\u25e6\u201383\u25e6), the EISCAT VHF\nradar located on the Norwegian mainland measured no sig-\nnificant structuring of the ionospheric electron density in the\nregion equatorward of Svalbard (69\u25e6\u201375\u25e6 magnetic latitude).\nThis is an indication of the lack of electron precipitation in\nthis region. As such the region equatorward of Svalbard is in-\nferred to correspond to closed magnetic field lines that do not\nmap to the vicinity of the magnetopause. This is consistent\nwith the ionospheric projection of the open\/closed magnetic\nfield line boundary (from which the PIFs originate) lying\nsomewhere in the vicinity of Svalbard \u2013 certainly poleward\nof 75\u25e6 magnetic latitude. While neither CUTLASS radar\nobserved PIFs after \u223c07:30 UT, it is worth noting that this\ndoes not necessarily mean the absence of pulsed ionospheric\nflows. Instead, it suggests an absence of the decametre-scale\nionospheric irregularities required to backscatter the HF sig-\nnals that this measurement technique relies upon. The con-\ntinued observation of PIF-like signatures by the ESR after\n07:30 UT supports the inference that reconnection and pulsed\nionospheric flows continued during the interval when the\nCluster spacecraft were traversing the high latitude magne-\ntopause (i.e. after 07:30 UT), but the CUTLASS radars were\nunable to detect the PIFs due to a lack of backscatter targets.\nTherefore we interpret the observations as compelling evi-\ndence of a tilted low latitude X-line during an interval of both\nnorthward and southward IMF strongly BY dominated by a\nduskward component of the IMF, although these space- and\nground-based measurements cannot rule out the simultane-\nous occurrence of high-latitude (anti-parallel) reconnection.\nIn addition to the pulsed ionospheric flows associated with\nreconnection at the magnetopause, ground-based radars and\nmagnetometers observed wave-like perturbations in the iono-\nspheric flow and magnetic field, respectively. These per-\nturbation preceded, coincided with, and followed the two\nbrief intervals when the Double Star and Cluster spacecraft\nwere observing FTEs in the vicinity of the dayside magne-\ntopause. Previous studies have linked pulsed magnetic re-\nconnection, magnetospheric oscillations, field line resonance\nand periodic perturbations in the solar wind. For example,\nPrikryl et al. (1998) presented compressional MHD waves\nin the solar wind with a period \u223c15 min that applied os-\ncillating magnetic\/electric fields and dynamic pressure on\nthe dayside magnetopause. Convection flow bursts in the\nionospheric footprint of the cusp were found to be closely\ncorrelated with low frequency oscillations of the IMF BZ\nand duskward electric field in the magnetosheath. Prikryl\net al. (1998) concluded that the ULF waves in the solar wind\nmodulated the magnetic reconnection at the dayside magne-\ntopause into pulses. Rae et al. (2004) observed identical peri-\nodicity of the solar wind electric field, pulsed particle signa-\ntures in the cusp and the pulsed ionospheric flow signatures\nof magnetic reconnection. Rae and co-authors concluded that\nsolar wind Alfv\u00e9n waves modulated the dayside interaction\nbetween solar wind and magnetosphere producing periodic\nFTEs, pulsed cusp precipitation and poleward moving radar\nauroral forms (PMRAFs). Given the availability of radar and\nmagnetometer data from the (pre-noon) Scandinavian sector\nduring this interval, we shall briefly examine the periodic os-\ncillations presented above and consider their significance to\nthe reconnection signatures introduced above.\nFigure 13 presents normalised Fourier transform spectra\nof the oscillations in the solar wind dawnward electric field\nmeasured at ACE (computed from EY=\u2212VX\u00d7BZ), the east-\nwest component of the magnetic field measured by the Ny\n\u00c5lesund (NAL) and Hella (HLL) ground magnetometers,\nand the line-of-sight Doppler velocity measured at \u223c72\u25e6\nMlat by the EISCAT VHF radar. In each case, time-series\nspanning the interval indicated have been high-pass filtered\nto leave periodicities less than 1 h (black trace) and 30 min\n(red trace). This corresponds to frequencies greater than\n\u223c0.28 mHz and \u223c0.56 mHz respectively. Note that in the\ncase of the EISCAT l-o-s data, the available time-series was\n\u223c3 h in duration \u2013 considerably shorter than the other time-\nseries analysed. Therefore, only the 30 min high-pass filtered\nspectrum has been presented.\nClearly, between 06:00\u201309:00 UT on 25 March 2004, the\ndawn-dusk electric field in the lagged solar wind was dom-\ninated by fluctuations at a frequency of 0.55 mHz (\u223c30 min\nperiodicity) with a secondary local maximum at 0.35 mHz\n(\u223c48 min). On the ground, both the NAL and HLL spec-\ntra are dominated by a peak at 0.47 mHz (\u223c35 min). When\nperiodicities greater than 1 h are filtered from the time se-\nries and the spectra re-analysed, the significance of the sub-\nsidiary peaks in the 0.7\u20131.2 mHz range is emphasised \u2013 the\nhigher frequency peaks in the NAL and HLL frequency\nspectrum exhibit some similarity to those in the dawn-dusk\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/ Ann.

In contrast, fluctuations in the line-\nof-sight velocity measured along the approximately north-\nward pointing beam of the EISCAT VHF radar were domi-\nnated by higher frequency oscillations. In this case, there is\na sharp peak at 3.5 mHz (\u223c5 min) that dominates the spec-\ntrum. These are the very clear oscillations apparent in the\ntime-series presented in Fig. 10 \u2013 the lower frequency \u201cenve-\nlope\u201d (\u223c40 min period) having been suppressed by the high-\npass filter. Measurements from the DOppler Pulsation Ex-\nperiment (DOPE: Wright et al., 1997; Yeoman et al., 2000)\n\u2013 not shown here \u2013 also indicated strong ionospheric wave\npropagation during this interval. The 5.73 MHz propagation\npath between the DOPE transmitter and receiver (Skibotn\u2013\nTroms\u00f8 path) in northern Norway was disturbed by \u223c30\u2013\n40 min period oscillations that influenced the the refractive\nindex and bulk motion of ionospheric plasma along path\nthroughout the interval of interest.\nThe data presented above reveal that the dayside magne-\ntosphere and ionosphere are alive with ULF wave activity\nduring the interval in which magnetic reconnection was ob-\nserved to occur. The order of magnitude increase in wave\namplitude observed at NAL compared to the other ground\nmagnetometer stations presented in Fig. 11 (and the other\nmagnetometers in the SAMNET and IMAGE network not\nincluded here) suggests that the oscillations in the solar wind\nwere driving a field line resonance on the Ny \u00c5lesund field\nline. As can be seen from Fig. 2, this is at the same approxi-\nmate magnetic latitude as the Cluster and Double Star space-\ncraft when mapped from their location in the vicinity of the\ndayside magnetopause. Further analysis reveals that there is\nlittle or no latitudinal phase structure in the oscillations with\nfrequencies less than 1 mHz suggesting that these are global\nmodes of oscillation. This is confirmed by the examination\nof data from the high latitude stations of the 210 Meridian\nmagnetometer chain located some 8 h of magnetic local time\neastward of the Scandinavian sector (not shown). The higher\nfrequency waves observed in the Scandinavian exhibit low,\npositive azimuthal wave numbers in the range 1\u20135 and, as\nsuch, appear to propagate eastward towards noon. This is\nconsistent with CUTLASS Iceland SuperDARN radar data.\nThese measurements, taken along an eastward pointing beam\nindicate show\u223c5 min period waves modulating the eastward\n(noonward) plasma flow in the F-region ionosphere. Given\nthe near meridional alignment of the EISCAT VHF radar\nbeam, it is not possible to infer the zonal motion of the phase\nstructure of the \u223c5 min fluctuations with any certainty, al-\nthough there is strong evidence of poleward phase motion.\nIt is probably impossible to ascribe a definite link between\nthe ULF waves observed in the solar wind and ionosphere\nwith the signatures of magnetic reconnection observed at the\nmagnetopause and in the high-latitude ionosphere. However,\nit is interesting to note that inter-PIF period observed by the\nionospheric radars employed in this study (\u223c10\u201315 min) cor-\nresponds to the frequency range in which oscillations are\npresent in the solar wind (from ACE data) and magneto-\nsphere (from ground magnetometer data). The inter-FTE pe-\nriod observed at Cluster was much shorter at\u223c3\u20134 min, how-\never, the SuperDARN and EISCAT data at this time did not\nprovide sufficient coverage or temporal resolution to quality\nto investigate any ionospheric signatures of these FTEs.\n5 Conclusions\nOver a three hour interval 06:00\u201309:00 UT on 25 March\n2004, the IMF and solar wind were steady with a strongly\nduskward orientation and a speed of \u223c350 km s\u22121. During\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 219\u2013238, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/219\/2007\/\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster, Double Star, and ground-based observations of FTEs 235\nthis period, the Double Star TC1 and Cluster spacecraft tra-\nversed the dayside magnetopause, Double Star moving in-\nbound from the magnetosheath at low southern latitude and\nCluster moving outbound at high northern latitude. The mag-\nnetopause traversals all took place at \u223c13:00 MLT but were\nseparated by approximately one hour. While in the magne-\ntosheath\/boundary layer, several flux transfer events were ob-\nserved by both Double Star and Cluster. In each case, these\nwere characterised by bipolar perturbations in the magnetic\nfield component normal to the local magnetopause, enhance-\nments in the total magnetic field strength and evidence of\nmagnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma mixing.\nEven though the FTEs were not observed simultaneously\nat high and low latitudes (with approximately one hour elaps-\ning between the TC1 and Cluster observations) the relatively\nuniform IMF and solar wind conditions suggested that the re-\nconnection line location and orientation did not change sig-\nnificantly over the intervening interval. This assumption was\ntested using the Cooling model of flux tube motion over the\nsurface of the magnetopause. The main findings are:\n\u2013 The direction of plasma flow in the magnetopause\nboundary layer measured at the Double Star and Clus-\nter spacecraft are generally consistent with magnetic re-\nconnection occurring at a tilted X-line passing through\nthe sub-solar point. Similarly, the direction of motion\nof FTEs derived from a multi-spacecraft analysis of the\nbipolar signatures observed by Cluster was consistent\nwith that of a newly-opened flux tube launched from a\ntilted X-line passing through the sub-solar point.\n\u2013 Under the prevailing BY dominated IMF conditions, the\nCooling model predicted that Northern Hemisphere flux\ntubes launched from a subsolar X-line (consistent with\nthe component reconnection model) would engulf the\nDouble Star and Cluster spacecraft. This was entirely\nconsistent with the normal polarity FTEs observed at\neach spacecraft. Flux tubes originating from an anti-\nparallel reconnection site were not predicted to pass by\neither Cluster or Double Star. We thus infer that the\nobserved FTEs originated from a low latitude tilted X-\nline rather than a high latitude anti-parallel X-line.\n\u2013 While the direction of motion in the plane of the magne-\ntopause was in good agreement, the Cooling model sig-\nnificantly over-estimated the speed of flux tube motion\nand boundary-layer flow. We note that this is consis-\ntent with a recent survey of Cluster data by Longmore\net al. (2004) that has reported a deceleration of the mag-\nnetosheath flow at higher latitudes close to the magne-\ntopause. This has highlighted an important difference\nbetween observations and the gas-dynamic models on\nwhich the Cooling model is based. The implications for\nthis increasingly exploited model of open flux tube mo-\ntion requires further investigation.\n\u2013 During much of the interval, ground-based measure-\nments in the high latitude dayside ionosphere revealed\npulsed ionospheric flows (PIFs) originating from the\nvicinity of the Cluster and Double Star magnetic foot-\nprints. These signatures were accompanied by struc-\ntured precipitation enhancing the electron density in the\nF-region ionosphere, observed by the EISCAT Svalbard\nradar. The PIFs are interpreted as further evidence of\nongoing dayside reconnection.\n\u2013 Throughout the interval there was evidence of ULF os-\ncillations in the solar wind, on magnetospheric field\nlines and in the ionospheric plasma flow. A range of\nperiodicities were apparent, including fluctuations ap-\nproximately matching the inter-FTE period observed by\nground-based radars, but not the inter-FTE period ob-\nserved by Cluster in the magnetopause.\nTherefore, based upon a simple model of open flux tube mo-\ntion over the surface of the magnetopause constrained by\nspace- and ground-based measurements of the signatures of\nflux transfer, we conclude that under strongly duskward IMF\nconditions, component reconnection was occurring at a tilted\nX-line passing through the sub-solar region. There was no\nevidence of reconnection at high latitude, anti-parallel re-\nconnection sites at either the Cluster or Double Star space-\ncraft. This potent synergy of measurements and modelling\nthus reveals the likely location and orientation of the recon-\nnection X-line during the period under scrutiny. In an initial\nstudy of the same interval based solely on observational data\n(Wild et al., 2005b) such an inference proved impossible.\nTherefore, we suggest that the analysis technique described\nabove represents a powerful tool for investigating the loca-\ntion of the reconnection site on the dayside magnetopause.\nHowever, despite simultaneous observations of ULF pulsa-\ntions throughout the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem, the causal relationship between ULF pulsations and\nthe modulation of the reconnection process remains unclear\nand will no doubt be the focus of future scrutiny.\nAcknowledgements.
