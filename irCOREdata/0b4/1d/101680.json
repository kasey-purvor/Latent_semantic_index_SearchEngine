Using the \nconcepts of \u2018policy-oriented learning\u2019 with \u2018coordination\u2019, it explores how the \npolicy-makers have developed and implemented policy during a period of change in \nideologies, organizational values and interests. In doing so it reveals how the \nfragmented nature of tourism and the fragmented power structure have meant that \npolicy-making has been conducted by a variety of policy-makers, with a diversity of \nvalues and interests. It also shows how policy-oriented learning has allowed the \npolicy-makers to succeed in a number of key areas, often with support from the state \nleaders. \nKeywords: policy-makers, policy-oriented learning, coordination, China  \n 1 \nINTRODUCTION \nThis paper explores and explains, from the policy-makers\u2019 perspective, the ways in \nwhich tourism policy-making has proceeded in China during a period of rapid change. \nIn doing so, it aims to contribute to an understanding of the development of tourism in \nChina itself, but also by using the experience of China in a period of change, it aims \nto contribute to knowledge about policy-making for tourism more generally. The \nsheer importance for tourism of policy and policy-making has been emphasised by \nRichter (1989) who suggests that whether it succeeds or fails is largely a function of \npolitical and administrative actions, rather than economics or business. But it is the \ncomment by Kerr (2003 xvii) who notes that \u2018the majority of tourism policy research \nis underdeveloped in terms of frameworks, approaches and theories\u2019 that provides the \nbroader context for the paper. By considering the case in one country, particularly one \nin which the government has an overwhelming role, which is highly bureaucratic and \nwhich has been coping with major changes, this gives an important opportunity to \nprovide an understanding of policy-making that also has wider relevance in \ncontributing to these frameworks, approaches and theories. \nPublic policy-making is a key area of policy research, focusing on the factors \nthat affect policy formulation and implementation, as well as the subsequent effects of \npolicy (Howlett and Ramesh 2003; Jenkins-Smith and Sabatier 1993a; Jenkins-Smith \n 2 \nand Sabatier 1993b; Sabatier 1991; Sabatier 1999a; Sabatier 2007; Sabatier and \nJenkins-Smith 1999; Sabatier and Weible 2007; Simeon 1976; Simmons, Davis, \nChapman and Sager 1974). Most approaches consider the policy-makers as a key \nexplanatory factor (Howlett and Ramesh 2003; Kerr, 2003). They stand at the core \nsince policy is formulated and implemented by the actors. Lindblom (1980: 2) \nsuggests \u2018to understand who or what makes policy, one must understand the \ncharacteristics of the participants, what parts or roles they play, what authority and \nother powers they hold, and how they deal with and control each other.\u2019 Their \nimportance has recently been acknowledged in some tourism policy studies (Dredge, \n2006; Pforr, 2006; Bramwell and Meyer, 2007; Stevenson, Airey and Miller, 2008.).  \nPolicy-makers comprise both official and unofficial actors (Anderson 2003). \nTourism is a sector of political, economic and social facets and typified by a diversity \nand number of organizations and issues (Elliot 1997). Hence policy-making is \ncharacterized by the involvement of government agencies, non-government \norganizations and businesses. China is no exception in this. Elliot (1997) summarizes \nthe national policy actors as including state leaders, service ministries, national \ntourism administrations (NTA), sector ministries, local government, statutory \norganizations, industry associations as well as interest groups. Elliot (1997: 71) \napplies the concept of \u2018policy community\u2019 (Howlett and Ramesh 2003; Rhodes 1984) \n 3 \nand suggests a policy community as consisting of \u2018the key organizations and actors \nwho participate in policy and who are continually in touch with and talking to each \nother\u2019. The multi-faceted nature of tourism prompts diverse values and interests and a \nfragmented power structure at both government and industry levels (Elliot 1987, \n1997). Though the NTA normally exercises a central role, authority is scattered \namong many national agencies. \nThe importance of an intellectual component in policy-making has been widely \nacknowledged (Busch and Braun 1999; Hall 1990, 1993; Lindblom 1980, 1993; \nSabatier 1987, 1993). Hall (1990:53) indicates that state policies are \u2018deeply \nconditioned by the findings and presumptions of contemporary social science.\u2019 Busch \nand Braun (1999:1) argue that \u2018public policy is only possible within a cognitive \nframework\u2019. Despite this, Lindblom asserts \u2018there is no possibility of replacing \npolitics by analysis\u2019 (1993:24) and \u2018all government policy-making can be considered \npolitical\u2019, because of the overwhelming use of authority (1993:7). The role of \ncognition and knowledge is rather to adapt to the political process, serving as an \ninstrument of persuasion to move the policy-makers closer to rational consent \nvoluntarily, thereby improving the quality of the political process of policy-making \n(Lindblom 1993). This paper suggests that the combination of political and cognitive \ninteractions can be described by two concepts, \u2018policy-oriented learning\u2019 (or \u2018policy \n 4 \nlearning\u2019) and \u2018coordination\u2019.  \nThe paper has three purposes. The first is to set out the institutional framework \nand policy-makers involved at a national level in China\u2019s tourism sector. In this it \nconsiders the complex relationships prompted both by the multi-faceted nature of \ntourism and by China\u2019s bureaucratic nature. The second is to review the ways in \nwhich policy-making in China proceeds through a process of \u2018policy-oriented \nlearning\u2019 and \u2018coordination\u2019. Together, these provide the context to understand the \nways in which China\u2019s policy-making has developed. The third purpose goes beyond \nChina. This is to use the experience of China, during a turbulent time, to contribute to \nan understanding of tourism policy-making more generally, drawing particularly on \nthe theoretical concepts of \u2018policy-oriented learning\u2019 and \u2018coordination\u2019. \n \nPOLICY-MAKERS FOR TOURISM \nThere are not many empirical studies of policy-makers\u2019 engagement in \npolicy-oriented learning (Busenberg 2001). Deviating from the traditional norm of \npolitics as a power struggle and of policy as the outcome (Hall 1990:53), Heclo \n(1974:304-305) argues that government is not only \u2018power\u2019, but also \u2018puzzle\u2019; \npolicy-making is a mode of \u2018collective puzzlement on society itself\u2019. Policy actors \nengage in learning because of their cognitive limitations compared to the size and \n 5 \ncomplexity of the problems (Lindblom 1993; Simon 1957). Singh (2001:143), for \nexample, describes India\u2019s national tourism policy-making as a \u2018long process of \nlearning through trial and error\u2019. Howlett and Ramesh (2003) comment that both \nHeclo and Hall see policy learning as a response to external environments; \npolicy-makers must adapt to enable their decisions to succeed when the environment \nchanges.  \nJenkins-Smith and Sabatier (1993b:42) and Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith \n(1999:123) consider policy learning as the relatively enduring alterations of thought \nor behavioral intentions arising from experience and\/or new information. \nJenkins-Smith and Sabatier (1993b:42-43) ascribe the most important topics of policy \nlearning to the improvement in actors\u2019 understanding of the status of goals and other \nimportant variables and the identification and response to challenges to actors\u2019 belief \nsystems, including exogenous events and opponents\u2019 activities. In other words, the \ntargets of policy learning have expanded from the objective environment stimulus to a \nseries of factors considered to be related to policy-making (Jenkins-Smith and \nSabatier 1993b:43).  \nBased on Sabatier\u2019s work, policy learning could be further refined as the \ncognitive process undertaken by policy-makers to comprehend a set of factors that not \nonly cover environmental forces, but also ideology, values, interests and power. The \n 6 \nideology, values and interests will be incorporated when the actors explore the \nenvironmental stimulus. They serve as an interpretation framework to generate the \nmeaning of the environmental conditions for the initiatives. As each policy-maker has \ntheir own values, interests and power, they are viewed as different \u2018partisans\u2019 with \neach pursuing \u2018some combination of private purposes and his or her own vision of the \npublic interests\u2019 (Lindblom 1993:25). Generally, policy-makers generate initiatives \nfrom their learning.  Lindblom (1993:13) has suggested that policy analysis as a \nmethod of learning in the form, for example, of collection and interpretation of facts \nand subsequent debate, tends to overwhelm policy-making. As the values and interests \nvary or even conflict, the analysis conducted is used to buttress arguments. Thus, the \noutcomes of analysis to a large extent are fragmented (Lindblom 1993:48).  \nTo sum up, policy learning refers to a cognitive and epistemic process through \nwhich the policy-makers apply ideas and information to decisions (Busenberg 2001). \nThe difference lies in their different beliefs and interests resulting in diverse learning \noutcomes. Under such circumstances the exercise of power through coordination \ninevitably occurs.  \nCoordination refers to the \u2018extent to which organizations attempt to ensure that \ntheir activities take into account those of other organizations\u2019 (Hall, Clark, Giodarno, \nJohnson and Roekel 1977:459). The greater the number of actors, the greater the risks \n 7 \nin consensus building (Jansen-Verbeke 1989:240). Given the multi-faceted nature of \ntourism, inter-organizational coordination is likely to be critical (Pearce 1992), \nespecially in relation to the effectiveness of the various government roles (Hall 1994) \nsince numerous individuals and organizations seek influence in pursuing their \ninterests (Hall 1998; Hall and Jenkins 1995). Like other fields, coordination for \ntourism policy-making is about politics and power (Hogwood and Gunn 1984). The \npower distribution determines who gets what, when and how (Elliot 1997). Although \nthe exact distribution differs, the presence or absence of a dominant power holder \nprovides two general scenarios. If one or one group of actors dominates, their values \nor interests prevail (Hall and Jenkins 1995). Conversely, coordination leads to \nconsensus building, without dominant actors.  \nIt is a truism that coordination is heavily conducted in tourism policy-making. \nBecause of its fragmented power structure, authority and power are diffused (Hall \n1994; Jansen-Verbeke 1989). Only the top leaders hold dominant power. NTAs lack \npower to formulate and implement decisions independently of other government \nagencies; industry members often fail to provide a coherent grouping to influence \ngovernment. In summary \u2018policy-oriented learning\u2019 and \u2018coordination\u2019 can been seen \nas a theoretical continuum; in the absence of either, the roles of policy-makers cannot \nbe adequately conceptualized. In the context of the Chinese policy-making literature \n 8 \nthis can be characterized as the ideological (normative and tendency models) and \npower struggles (factions model) at the top-level with bureaucratic bargaining at \nmiddle and local levels (structural and bureaucratic politics models) (Liberthal & \nOksenberg, 1988; Lieberthal & Lampton, 1992; Huang, 1999).  \n \nStudy Methods \nMainland China was selected for this study of policy-making for a number of \nreasons. First, tourism development in China provides an interesting context. In Mao\u2019s \nera, it had no role to play in China\u2019s planned economy and social development. Rather \nit was used as a political and diplomatic vehicle. It was not until 1978 that tourism \ncommenced its economic function and became an active policy area. This has been an \nincremental process in which its socioeconomic role has been recognized by the state \nand society. A second reason is that tourism and associated policy-making in China \nare relatively unexplored and it has become a large and expanding sector in China, \nwhich now ranks second in absolute size, with the second fastest growth in the world \n(World Travel and Tourism Council 2008). A third reason for focusing on China is \nthat its socialist political system and long history of a centrally planned economy \nmean that public policy-making serves as an overarching umbrella for development. \nThis then provides a setting for the final reason, which is that by seeing how policy \n 9 \nmakers in a highly bureaucratic system have responded to and engaged in rapid \nchange in China, this provides important insights into the ways in which \npolicy-making proceeds. \nChina\u2019s present Socialist Market Economy Model implemented since 1992 is \ndifferent from those of the West. Within this political-economic model, public \nownership is still predominant but needs to co-exist with the private sector. On this \nbasis, the market mechanism, under the macro-control of the state, has superseded the \ncentral master plan as the fundamental mechanism in resource allocation. The Chinese \ngovernment still engages in the macro-management of the national economy, \noperating and controlling strategic industries and regulating certain prices. Thus, the \ngovernment-leading mode has remained intact, despite its shift from \u2018dominant\u2019 status \nin the planned economy, to \u2018driving\u2019 status in China\u2019s market economy. With this \nbackground China provides a fascinating environment in which to explore \npolicy-making and the fact that tourism is a relatively new development provides the \npotential to explore how the bureaucratic mechanisms are responding to the need for \npolicy changes. \nGuided by qualitative approaches, the data for the study were mainly collected \nbetween 2002 and 2006; with some more recent updating, relating, for example, to the \ngovernment reshuffle announced in March 2008. The main sources were key \n 10\ninformant interviews (Marshall and Rossman 2006) selected based on their political \nand professional involvement in China\u2019s national policy-making over a long period. \nTen interviews were conducted in Chinese. Three respondents were senior officials \nwith the ministerial government agencies responsible for tourism; five were policy \nconsultants with the ministerial research institution; two were senior industry \npractitioners who well understood policy implementation during the past few decades. \nThe topics of the semi-structured interviews (Mason, 2002) included \u2013 the number of \npolicy-makers in tourism; their roles and approaches in policy-making; institutional \narrangements; and interaction issues. Triangulation was used for cross-checking the \ninformation validity (Berg, 2004). All interviews were recorded, translated and \ntranscribed with further clarifications sought. The interviews were supplemented by \ngovernment documents (Berg 2004; Marshall and Rossman 2006). The data were \nanalyzed based on a set of inquiry procedures (Miles and Huberman 1994; Strauss \nand Corbin 1998) under the broad approaches of grounded theory (Johns and \nLee-Ross 1998; Ritchie and Lewis 2003) and historical analysis (Berg, 2004; \nMarshall and Rossman 2006; Towner 1988). An integrative interpretation approach \nwas used to present the data from the interviews and government documents. This is \ndescribed by Denzin (1998: 317) and Marshall and Rossman (2006: 161) as \u2018story \ntelling\u2019; it aims is to bring meaning and coherence to the themes, patterns, and \n 11 \ncategories, establishing a connection and a story line that make sense of the \nqualitative information (Marshall and Rossman, 2006: ibid). The findings presented \ndraw from the interviews and government documents, using the broader literature \nwhere appropriate. Quotations from interviewees are provided to support particular \npoints but following Rubin and Rubin (1995) and Kvale (1996) these are used \nsparingly considering that overuse can easily detract from the clarity of the main \ncommentary (White, Woodfield and Richie, 2005: 290). The paper covers the Reform \nEra (from 1978), with a focus on the Collective Leadership Period (1997 to present). \nChina\u2019s last paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, died in 1997. Inquiries into \npolicy-making in China are still considered sensitive and this is acknowledged as a \nlimitation. Following standard practice in the social sciences, interviewees\u2019 names are \nnot disclosed. This is important in the context of China (Shirk, 1993:20). \n \nOverview of Findings \nChina has adopted a party-state political structure since 1949, that is, the \nCommunist Party of China  rules the nation. The Central Government \u2013 State \nCouncil, is theoretically accountable to the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) \n(China\u2019s Parliament), but in fact is directed and overseen by the Politburo of the \nCommunist Party (Lieberthal 2004). As China\u2019s highest executive organ, the State \n 12\nCouncil consists of both cabinet rank and non-cabinet rank agencies, with their \nbureaucratic grades varying from \u2018supra-ministry\u2019, \u2018ministry\u2019, \u2018sub- or vice-ministry\u2019 \nto \u2018bureau\u2019 grades. Although cabinet-rank and non cabinet-rank agencies can be at the \nsame \u2018ministry\u2019 grade, only cabinet agencies can be present at the plenary meetings of \nthe State Council and have voting rights on key decisions. The different bureaucratic \nranks have different degrees of decision-making and administrative and bargaining \npower in policy-making and implementation.  \nChina\u2019s national policy-makers operate within this political structure. The \npolicy-making is shaped by a constellation of both official and unofficial actors. \nWriting about twenty years ago on bureaucratic politics, Lampton (1987), Lieberthal \nand Oksenberg (1988) and Lieberthal and Lampton (1992) considered that Chinese \npolicy-making was fragmented, as the authority in shaping decisions was nested in \nmany central agencies with bargaining and consensus building as its main features. \nToday this remains a feature and, if anything, tourism\u2019s multi-faceted nature \nexacerbates the fragmentation. Different government agencies deal with different \naspects according to their respective responsibilities and the nature of the issues. One \ninterviewee suggested:  \n\u201cWe (China National Tourism Administration \u2013 the NTA) have working \nrelationships with over thirty government agencies in the State Council, \n 13\ndifferent opinions usually occur and the degree of difficulty in coordination is \nvery high.\u201d \nAmong the community, the core policy-makers are the specialized agency for \ntourism - China National Tourism Administration (CNTA); supra-ministerial agencies \n(or comprehensive or macro-management agencies) \u2013 National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Finance (MoF); the quality \nadministration agency for products and services \u2013 State General Administration of \nQuality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine; the policy think tank - the Chinese \nAcademy of Social Sciences; and local government. However, it is really China\u2019s \npolitical leaders who have led the development during the decades from 1978. Only \nthe leaders have had sufficient power to launch major initiatives, often in response to \nproposals or requests from the subordinate agencies. An interviewee acknowledged: \n\u201cIn China, the instructions, speeches, talks from the national leaders are \nconsiderably powerful and effective.\u201d \nAmong the leaders, the Vice-Premier or State Councilor whose supervision \nportfolio covers tourism has immediate oversight. As a specialized agency, CNTA is \nresponsible for overall policy and development. Of the supra-ministerial agencies \nNDRC exercises macro-management of the national economy and integrates tourism \ndevelopment with other sectors. CNTA and NDRC, particularly the former, are the \n 14\nmain sources of proposals. The MoF provides financial support. The State General \nAdministration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine has responsibility \nfor establishing quality standards; it collaborates with CNTA in setting up quality \nassurance. The think tank provides consultancy advice to government and suggests \npolicy proposals.  \nWhere disagreements occur between the various bodies, that the CNTA as the \nprimary agency is unable to resolve or coordinate, it requests assistance from the \nGeneral Office of State Council, which in turn may seek the views of the \nVice-Premier or State Councilor with immediate supervisory role. Other premiers or \nstate councilors will also be involved as appropriate. Consensus building is provided \nby the National Tourism Works Conference, which is held annually and acts as a \nnation-wide forum. It is in this landscape that China\u2019s national policy-making for \ntourism takes place.  \nUltimately it is an iterative process of policy learning and coordination. On the \none hand, it can be seen as an epistemic and cognitive process. On the other hand, the \nstate ideologies, values and interests that have formed the distinct organizational goals \nand responsibilities of each agency, provide an interpretation framework to \nunderstand the environmental circumstances. Bargaining and negotiation occur \nubiquitously. Except for marketing strategies and quality standards at the \n 15\nindustry-level (national-level should be made jointly with the quality agency), almost \nall other initiatives from CNTA touch on other central government agencies. In this \nway, China\u2019s national policy-making proceeds through a process of policy-oriented \nlearning and coordination.  \n \nThe Key Policy-Makers \nLeaders: Since the implementation of Economic Reform in 1978, successive \nnational leaders have favored the development of tourism and have recognized its role \nin the activities of the state. Under this influence it has evolved over thirty years from \nan economic to a more multi-functional activity. Above all the leaders imparted \ntourism into the mindsets of the bureaucrats and prompted initiatives in the policy \nagenda. They determined the position of development in the state structure, \nestablished the agencies and mobilized nation-wide support. Its recognition as an \neconomic force after 1978 began with two top leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun. \nWhen ideological orthodoxies shifted from \u2018political struggle\u2019 to \u2018economic \nmodernization\u2019 in 1978, the scarcity of foreign exchange stimulated the leaders to \nconsider international tourism as a foreign exchange earner. China\u2019s ample resources \nand the resumption of diplomatic relationships with the major Western nations \nconvinced them that China possessed the required attributes for international tourism.  \n 16\nBetween late 1978 and early 1979, Deng delivered six consecutive speeches on \ntourism as an economic activity. As a result, officials, who since 1949 had seen it \npurely in political and diplomatic terms, began to accept commercial development and \nsubsequently revenue generation became a goal of the Bureau of Travel and Tourism \nof China (forerunner to the CNTA). Deng also envisaged it playing an experimental \nrole in introducing foreign investment and expertise. At Deng\u2019s insistence, the first \nforeign investment tourism project \u2018Jianguo Hotel\u2019 was eventually agreed. The fact \nthat its approval required the consent of all twelve vice-premiers reflected the degree \nof political controversy. Subsequently, foreign capital has been a key element in \neffecting China\u2019s economic transformation. Development before the late 1980s took \nplace under the central plan, in which only the CNTA and its subordinate enterprises \ncould run tourism businesses. It was the decision of the General Secretary of the \nCommunist Party of China in the mid-1980s that led to the decentralization of \ninvestment and operation to other central government departments, local government \nand the emerging private sector. \nMore recently the new generation of Chinese leadership further raised its \nposition. In the late 1990s, it was identified by the State Council as a new economic \ngrowth pole in recognition of enormous demand, strong growth and expanding size. \nIn 1998, during a visit to Xinjiang in the less developed Western China, Premier Zhu \n 17\nRongji urged local government to take full advantage of its resources and speed up its \ndevelopment. The MoF immediately aided Xinjiang with US$75 million and the \nGeneral Administration of Customs granted a tariff-free privilege for the import of \n300 tour buses (source: interview). During his premiership Zhu emphasized the \nimportance of tourism more than ten times in his inspection visits.  \nChina is currently confronting a series of issues, including the decline in the \nrelative size of the state sector, diversified values and interests in society, intensified \nsocial stratifications, tensions among interest groups, rising social unrest and terrorist \nattacks as well as perceived threats by foreign nations. Tourism, in such circumstances, \nis conceived by the Chinese leaders as a multi-functional industry with economic, \npolitical-ideological, socio-cultural and diplomatic roles. In the political-ideological \nrealm, it is to enhance nationalism, patriotism, and socialist values and to strengthen \nthe national union. In foreign affairs, it has a role to play in promoting China\u2019s \nachievements and friendships. In the social and cultural realm it is seen to enhance \nlife quality and social harmony. But perhaps most importantly its economic function \nserves as the base for the effective accomplishment of these other roles. The \nDocument of the National Tourism Works Conference 2004 (CNTA, 2004: 7) \nsummarized the leaders\u2019 conceptions as follows: \n\u201cWe should emphasize the function of tourism as an economic industry; we \n 18\nalso should emphasize more the comprehensive functions of tourism in \nproviding employment, promoting Chinese culture and building the socialist \nspiritual civilization.\u201d  \nChina National Tourism Administration: While the CNTA is the central \ngovernment agency directly responsible to the State Council for policy-making, \ndevelopment and administration, in common with NTAs elsewhere and for similar \nreasons, its powers are limited. First, policy-making authority is widely distributed. \nFor example, resources and attractions are under the jurisdiction of different agencies, \nincluding the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the State Forestry \nAdministration, the State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State \nAdministration for Cultural Relics. Secondly, CNTA has a relatively low \nadministrative status, as tourism is a latecomer to the policy-making arena. Though it \nis directly under the State Council, it is not a cabinet-rank agency and is only graded \nat the \u2018sub- or vice-ministry\u2019 rank. As a result, it cannot directly bring issues to \ncabinet meetings and it lacks the power to launch major initiatives.  \nThirdly, the political-ideological, socio-cultural and diplomatic dimensions \nappear at higher political levels. For instance, state ideology is directly overseen by a \nStanding Committee Member of the Politburo who in 2004 instructed that it should be \nused as a means to promote socialist and communist values. In brief, CNTA\u2019s \n 19\npolicy-making authority is effectively limited to marketing and setting non-mandatory \nquality standards. Except for these two fields, it cannot independently decide on \ninitiatives. Instead it coordinates with related agencies, including, as will be seen later, \nthe NDRC.  \nDespite such institutional hurdles, through a process of policy learning and \ncoordination with other agencies, CNTA has in fact achieved a degree of success in \nintroducing initiatives for development . These typically stem from the identification \nof solutions to issues by making reference to international norms and practices. As \none interviewee suggested: \n\u201cOur policy initiatives (or proposals) basically arise from two origins. First, \nwe need to learn the realities; we need to understand the real needs of our \nindustry. Second, we will make reference to the international practices.\u201d \nInside the CNTA, the Policy and Legal, and Industry Management Departments send \nofficials to the regions and to industry to identify issues that warrant a policy response. \nIn most cases, they draw upon international practice in forming this response. For \nexample, when the problem of an unsatisfactory level of service quality in luxury \nhotels was identified in the mid-1980s, CNTA turned to international norms to enact \nthe \u2018Regulation on the Star-Standards and Star-Rating of Tourist Hotels of PRC\u2019, with \nprofessional support from the United Nations World Tourism Organization.  \n 20\nThe progress of a proposal, once it is drafted, is first to the senior management \nfor consideration and approval followed by a process of coordination with other \nagencies. The coordination process depends on the complexity of issues, the variety of \nagencies involved and their attitudes as well as their respective bargaining power. \nThere are four likely outcomes. First, the initiative does not involve any conflict of \nviews and implementation begins. This was the case with the construction of twelve \nstate-level resorts in the mid-1990s. Secondly, it is able to negotiate an acceptable \ndecision with the other agencies. For example, the principal policy and administrative \nresponsibility for outbound travel was closely negotiated with the Ministry of Public \nSecurity. With the support from local party secretaries, CNTA finally obtained \njurisdiction over this aspect after some twenty meetings with the Ministry that \nmaintains its organizational responsibility for immigration services.  \nThirdly, an impasse is reached resulting in the intervention of the State Council. \nThe MoF was opposed to the \u2018Regulations on Quality Service Guarantee Funds of \nTravel Agencies\u2019, because of the perceived excessive fees levied on travel agencies. \nThis was only implemented with the support of two vice-premiers. Finally, no \ndecision is reached. With reference to foreign experience, the CNTA started to draft a \nTourism Law in the mid 1980s. After about twenty versions of the bill and numerous \nrounds of discussion with the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council and the \n 21\nFinancial and Economic Affairs Committee of the NPC, the bill has still not entered \nthe legislation plan. This is because the top priority is given to those acts relating to \nthe establishment and consolidation of market economy institutions as a whole. In \n2009, over 30 delegates of the NPC urged for its legislation. \nDecisions made at the center are ineffective, unless they can be implemented \nlocally. The annual National Tourism Works Conference, which is usually convened \nby the CNTA, but sometimes by the State Council, has particular importance here. \nThe participants include the Vice-Premier in-charge, all senior officials of CNTA, \nheads of local bureaus, consultants from the government think tank, and \nrepresentatives of state enterprises, government media and academics. Provincial \nparty secretaries and governors of key tourist regions are also invited. The Conference \nis in fact a briefing and consensus building process for the implementation of \ndecisions already agreed by the Vice-Premier. Given the size and diversity of the \ncountry the Conference plays a key role in national coordination.  \nWhile the move to a market economy has brought challenges to the CNTA, it has \nalso provided it with an unprecedented opportunity to break through some of the \nbureaucratic impediments. Indeed, in many ways the CNTA has shown a new model \nin policy-making and administration . On the demand side it has been responsible for \nan almost continuous development of promotional campaigns. On the supply side it \n 22\nhas had an important influence on the flow of investment. In the context of a shift \nfrom direct investment in attractions, to guidance of market forces and provision of \ninfrastructure with central government investing at least $1 billion (RMB 7 billion) \nfor infrastructure since 2000 (source: interview), the CNTA and NDRC have prepared \ndirectories of government recommended projects to direct and facilitate the flow of \ninvestment.  \nAlso starting in the 1990s, the CNTA attached top priority to the enhancement of \nquality in which it can play a more independent role. Following its success with hotel \nstandards, it appraised the setting of quality standards as an effective instrument for \nadministration, on the basis that its non-compulsory nature fitted well with \nmacro-management in a market economy and avoided significant controversy within \nthe bureaucratic structure. Moreover, quality is a common concern of the market \nincluding both industry and tourists. As a result, quality standards have become \ncentral to its work. Some 18 quality specifications have been implemented. This \ncombination of policy learning in relation to quality standards, including making \nreference to the quality mechanisms in other countries, with coordination where \nnecessary, together with an awareness of how to progress initiatives, has permitted the \nCNTA to develop into an effective agency even without real political authority. \nNational Development and Reform Commission: The NDRC is a \n 23\nsupra-ministerial cabinet agency in charge of the macro-management of economic and \nsocial development. It works closely with the MoF and the Central People\u2019s Bank, \nwhich provide fiscal and monetary support. The forerunner of NDRC, the State \nPlanning Commission, had responsibility for managing China\u2019s planned economy. \nThis was renamed the State Development Planning Commission  in 1998 and it \nbecame the NDRC in 2003, reflecting the fact that the central master plan was giving \nway to market forces. The Commission is mainly responsible for macro-control of the \nnational economy and major economic and social policies. \nIn contrast with the CNTA, that takes an insider\u2019s perspective, the NDRC has a \nmore generalist approach. In fact, neither agency puts forward initiatives \nindependently, but rather coordinates with each other, together with the MoF when \nfiscal support is required. The generalist and specialist angles usually complement \neach other with the former taking precedence. NDRC occupies four areas of \npolicy-making. First, it has the role of trying to achieve balance between inputs, for \nexample between planned tourist arrivals and the carrying capacity of civil aviation. \nSecondly, it links tourism with state development strategies, such as determining its \nposition in the national economy. Thirdly, it has responsibility for planning major \ndomestic and foreign investment projects and scrutinizing the composition of total \ninvestment. Finally, NDRC formulates the prices or pricing ranges for key \n 24\ncommodities and services. Tourist attractions fall into this category. \nAs a supra-ministerial agency, the NDRC considers economic and social issues \nfrom a strategic perspective. Generally, it has been supportive of development since \n1978. The degree of support, however, has varied with ideological orthodoxies, \norganizational values, socioeconomic conditions and performance. A relevant case is \nits positioning in the national economy. Although recognized as an economic activity \nin 1986, it failed to obtain its status in the economy until 1999. Over this decade, both \nthe NDRC and CNTA were actively studying and coordinating its economic role. In \nthe planned economy era, the market driven industry was generally considered \ninsignificant and even frivolous. Economic growth was viewed as mainly a supply \nside matter, with state investment in industries and agriculture. One interviewee \ndisclosed: \n\u201cThe macro-management government agencies \u2026\u2026\u2026attached importance \nto agriculture and industries and considered tourism petty and unimportant. \nTourism was simply viewed as an activity of \u2018dining, recreation and \namusement\u201d  \nThough international tourism could prove its importance in earning foreign \nexchange, domestic tourism with strong market growth was not recognized as an \neffective development vehicle, but rather was downplayed as a kind of \n 25\n\u2018non-productive force\u2019. In fact, the total incomes of international and domestic \ntourism, which only accounted for 1.6% of Gross Domestic Product in 1991 (CNTA, \n1992; SSB, 1992), certainly failed to convince the State Planning Commission and \nMoF of its economic significance. In 1986, the State Council, through the State \nPlanning Commission, provided CNTA with $73 million annually for development \nfor five years, with 30% in grants and 70% in loans. The ratio of grants was later \nreduced to 18%, considerably reducing the potential impact of CNTA (source: \ninterview). This was then reversed in the market economy era. The following \nparagraph from CNTA\u2019s policy document reflected the shift in the policy-making \nmindset : \n\u201cOur economic management under the planned economy was basically the \nsupply side management \u2026\u2026 Now the general circumstances are changing to \nthe market economy; therefore we should transform from the supply side \nmanagement to demand side management.\u201d (CNTA, 1998b: 14) \n \nIn the market economy era, consumption has been regarded as a key source of \neconomic growth. Issues facing China now include insufficiency in aggregate demand, \nhigh unemployment and imbalanced regional development. Tourism development has \ndemonstrated its potential in generating income, creating employment and promoting \n 26\nregional development. The total income reached over 4% of GDP in 1997 (CNTA, \n1998; SSB, 1998). As such, a series of policy studies and discussions proceeded \namong the State Planning Commission (NDRC), MoF, CNTA and other relevant \nagencies. The notable one was the \u2018Seminar about Tourism and Economic Growth\u2019 \nco-hosted by State Planning Commission and CNTA in March 1997. In this seminar, \nVice Minister of the Commission Hao Jianxiu expressed the changed view that: \n\u201cFrom its economic scale, employment and development pace, tourism is no \nlonger an unimportant industry, but rather a significant industry \u2026\u2026\u2019 (CNTA, \n1999b: p.87) \nIt was subsequently positioned by the State Council as a \u2018new growth pole in the \nnational economy\u2019 in 1998, and in 2008 was upgraded to \u2018a key industry in the \nnational economy\u2019. Under the current global financial turmoil, it has been further \npromoted in 2009 as one of five \u201chot consumption spots\u201d. These advances in \nrecognition have led to substantial measures such as the inclusion, since 2000, on the \nrecommendation of the NDRC, of investment funded from state bonds issued by the \nMoF. As a result, $190 million have subsequently been injected, mainly into less \ndeveloped Central and Western China (source: interview). \nMinistry of Finance: Like the NDRC, this is a cabinet-rank agency exercising a \nmacro-management role through fiscal and public finance policy. As far as tourism is \n 27\nconcerned its direct responsibility is for approving the CNTA\u2019s budget and the \ninspection fees imposed on the industry. In terms of overall fiscal policy, the main \ndevelopment has been a shift from expansion between 1998 and 2004 to more \nrestraint from 2005.  \nThe CNTA derives its funds from two sources: state appropriation, covering \nadministrative expenses and a portion of airport tax that is used for development \nprojects. Beginning in 1992, of the airport tax, currently $13 per passenger, $3 has \nbeen allocated to CNTA\u2019s development funds. This became the \u2018Tourism \nDevelopment Foundation\u2019 in 2001. MoF regulations limit the Foundation to financing \nmarketing and planning studies and to subsidizing the construction of attractions. \nFurther, in 2003, the MoF transferred administration of the Foundation to CNTA. \nMarketing accounts for the largest item of expenditure, increasing from $8.3 million \nin 1998 to $25 million recently, although this still lags behind competitors such as \nThailand, Singapore and Australia. The MoF also has the authority to ensure the \nreasonableness of fees levied by the CNTA on enterprises, such as quality guarantee \ncharges for travel agencies and administrative fees covering its services (source: \ninterview). \nState General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine: \nAs a non-cabinet ministerial agency, this is responsible for establishing quality \n 28\nstandard frameworks for products and services. This framework has been deemed an \nessential constituent of China\u2019s market institutions. The agency supports the CNTA, \nsometimes against other agencies, in its development of a quality assurance \nmechanism. For example, its support allowed CNTA\u2019s star-rating regulation for hotels \nto prevail when the Ministry of Internal Trade, now merged into the Ministry of \nCommerce, issued its own set of grading criteria for guesthouses (for domestic \ntravelers) that also extended to hotels. In 1993, the agency incorporated tourism into \nthe Master Catalogue of Standardization and appointed CNTA as the sole authority in \nmaking quality specifications. The CNTA designed the Catalogue for Tourism Quality \nSpecifications with six broad categories, tour operation, accommodation, catering, \ntravel, shopping and amusement. Since then, it has formally become a sector of \nChina\u2019s quality standards framework. \nLocal Government: Within China\u2019s political structure, local government at \nprovince-equivalent level is directly accountable to the central government. Some \npolitically important regions (e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Chonqqin, Guangdong) also \nenjoy a superior status, as their party secretaries are concurrently appointed as the \nPolitburo member of the Communist Party of China. Local bureaus report to local \ngovernment not the CNTA. A process of decentralization has provided increasing \nlocal autonomy especially in strategically or economically important regions. \n 29\nGenerally, local government is responsible for tourism development with local \nbureaus as their main agent.  \nApart from administrative orders, local government has a degree of flexibility in \ncentral decisions and indeed is encouraged to formulate their own strategies. Faced \nwith limited capacity, originally from the 1980s, central government favored \ninternational over domestic arrivals. This began to change from the mid 1980s. The \ngrowing economic impact on regional economies led local government to seek a \npolicy shift and jointly with support of CNTA in 1993, a decision was made to \ndevelop domestic tourism. The impact was particularly marked from the mid 1990s \nwhen it had become the mainstay. Since 1995, tourism (especially domestic) has been \nacknowledged in many regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Yunnan, \nGuizhou, Shaanxi, as a \u2018pillar industry\u2019, leading, as already noted, to further policy \nshifts by NDRC and MoF; at present, it has gained such status in over 80% of \nprovinces.  \nChinese Academy of Social Sciences: This has been in the vanguard of policy \nstudies for tourism. Formally established in 1978, the Academy is a government \nresearch institution with ministry rank directly under the State Council. It is the top \nacademic and research institution in social sciences and a key think tank for central \ngovernment. It plays an influential role in the State Council with its research findings \n 30\nunderpinning central government decisions. The Academy pioneered tourism studies \nin China in the 1980s. In 1987 the first strategic study concluded that it was a \n\u2018sunrise\u2019 and market-oriented industry and emphasized the potential importance of \ndomestic tourism. This was particularly significant during the early stages and among \nother things motivated the CNTA, and local bureaus, to take a market-oriented \napproach. Furthermore, this study also suggested the pace at which development \nshould go ahead; this was reiterated by the vice-premier in-charge in 2008. The \nAcademy subsequently established a research center in 1999 providing research and \nconsultancy advice to central and local government.  \nOther Policy Players: Clearly, the national organizations identified here and \nlocal governments have played key roles in the development of policy. But tourism\u2019s \nmulti-faceted nature means that these are not exhaustive; other government agencies \nare also involved.  \nAmong these, the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for diplomatic \nrelations and foreign policy takes it into two areas of tourism. It has responsibility for \nissuing visas to all foreign visitors, including direct visas to those taking group tours \norganized by travel agencies on the approved CNTA list. It also has responsibility for \nnegotiation with CNTA on opening the outbound market. Chinese citizens\u2019 travel \nabroad for leisure and recreation is restricted to tours organized by China's \n 31\ninternational travel agencies to travel destinations with \u2018approved destination status\u2019. \nThe approval process takes into account China's national interests and foreign policy, \nwith support for the 'One-China\u2019 stance and the recognition of China\u2019s full market \neconomy status being important elements in gaining approval. From this perspective, \nthe negotiation is seen as an extension of China\u2019s foreign affairs. \nThe Ministry of Communications, which covers all transport (except for the \nrailways), is responsible for ensuring that transport capacity, especially in aviation, \ncan meet the demands of inbound, outbound and domestic tourists. For this, CNTA \nhas established an arrangement to report tourist flows to the Civil Aviation \nAdministration of China, which comes within the Ministry of Communications, and \nthey work closely in dealing with capacity issues; with the NDRC providing a macro \nview as noted earlier. Further, the Civil Aviation Administration of China provides \nsupport, such as in the form of complimentary air tickets to invited guests and \ninternational buyers attending trade conferences hosted by the CNTA. The Ministry of \nCommunications also collaborates with the CNTA to scrutinize and approve cruise \nships on inland waterways. \nThe Ministry of Education determines the academic status of tourism in the state \neducation system and approves the establishment of education programs and \ninstitutions. As a relatively new field of study the Ministry of Education classifies it as \n 32\na \u2018Second-Tier Discipline\u2019, located within one of the \u2018First-Tier Disciplines\u2019 \n(management) which among other things means that doctoral candidates cannot be \nadmitted directly to tourism but rather to the major discipline. CNTA have supported \neducational institutions in opposing this, so far without success. A NPC delegate \nraised this issue again in 2009. Ministry of Education approval is also required for the \nestablishment of higher education institutions offering a program at degree level or \nabove. CNTA\u2019s formal support is a prerequisite for approval. The offer of sub-degree \nprograms or establishments is under the discretion of institutions or local government. \nOther agencies that have a bearing on policy-making include those with an \ninterest in its potential for income generation such as the forestry administration \nwhich has recently developed forestry tours. When CNTA proposes plans for the \ndevelopment of such attractions, the agencies concerned may raise objections if they \nperceive that their objectives are affected. The reforms in China have also promoted \nthe development of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), estimated to number of \nover 240,000 recently (Xinhua, 2004). These include both government-sponsored and \nvoluntary bodies representing stakeholders and interest groups. At present it is the \nstate-owned enterprises, often with personal covert lobbying channels, and foreign \ninvestment organizations, such as the International Hoteliers of Shanghai, that are the \nmost developed. \n 33\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe content of this paper is set within three key contexts. First, tourism policy \nstudies lack sufficient conceptualization in terms of frameworks, approaches and \ntheories (Kerr, 2003). Secondly, tourism as an activity is highly fragmented in relation \nto the policy actors. Thirdly, the strongly bureaucratic nature of the administrative \nmachinery in China has been adapting and changing with new policy initiatives. \nThese contexts provide a basis for understanding both the institutional framework for \npolicy-making and the relationships among the various actors, but more importantly \nthey provide a background to understand how policy-making proceeds. Given its \nmulti-faceted nature it is inevitable that policy-making for tourism is fragmented. This \nis true in all countries, including, as set out here, in China. What makes the case of \nChina particularly interesting is the way in which the growth in the scale and \nrecognition of tourism in the country has brought challenges to the process and how \nthe policy-makers have responded within the bureaucratic structure. This provides a \nbasis not only to explore how tourism policy-making has proceeded in China but from \nher distinctive characteristics during this period of change, it also offers perspectives \non policy-making more generally.  \nAs far as China itself is concerned, the multi-faceted nature of tourism \n 34\nexacerbates the fragmented authority structure in Chinese-styled bureaucracy. \nNational policy-making in China is carried out by a hierarchical and diverse set of \nactors. A core layer of policy-making takes place among the national leaders, and a \nrange of ministries, agencies and other bodies, with final decision-making power \nresting with the leaders. Within this, the policy-makers themselves clearly appear to \nbe engaged in the two processes of developing their cognitive behavior through policy \nlearning and pursuing political actions through coordination. This is particularly true \namong the leaders, NTA and macro-management agencies, as the decisions emerge \nfrom these processes. The respective ideologies, values and interests have shaped the \nviews of the policy-makers in interpreting their surroundings over time. Coordination \nis frequently needed due to the different views and the diffused authority . Ultimately \nthe state leaders are involved in this coordination.  \nThe gradual appreciation of tourism has brought into focus the comparatively \nlow administrative status and weak bargaining power of the CNTA. Although it acts \nas a primary and principal initiator for policy, it lacks real political authority. This is \nreflected in the fact that the majority of its development initiatives typically become \ndecisions only after inputs from the macro-management agencies. It also negotiates \nwith other relevant agencies regarding administration and resources management. \nThis often includes local support. Where there are disputes, the judgments are vested \n 35\nin the leaders. However, notwithstanding this lack of real authority, by a process of \npolicy learning, for example relating to quality mechanisms, with coordination where \nrequired, the experience of CNTA demonstrates how to operate effectively within the \nbureaucratic structure.  \nThis combination of policy learning and coordination has a more general \napplicability. Previous studies of policy-makers (e.g. Pforr, 2006; Bramwell and \nMeyer, 2007) concentrated on the power dimension in which the intellectual \ndimension is seen as embedded within the power interactions. Through the Chinese \ncontext, this paper argues that policy-making is a political process comprising two \nindependent but interrelated and indispensable components, policy learning and \ncoordination, undertaken by policy-makers within the existing institutional framework. \nLike a continuum, policy learning helps generate policy proposals whereas the policy \ndecisions from proposals rest with the coordination. In the absence of either, the \npolicy initiatives cannot come to a decision. It is this understanding of the \npolicy-making process and the roles of the policy-maker that is the main contribution \nof this empirical study to the policy literature. In a practical sense, the prominence \ngranted to the intellectual dimension can prompt policy-makers to consider how to \nenhance knowledge utilization in the decision-making process in ways that provide \nthe potential to minimise the exercise of sheer power in the process. \n 36\nGiven the highly bureaucratic structure of policy-making in China, and the \nobservation of its operation during a period of change, this twin approach of policy \nlearning and coordination is very apparent. In this sense China, at this time, provides a \ngood location to understand more fully this process of policy-making. The fact that all \npolitical systems are bureaucratic to some degree, and that responsibility for tourism \nis everywhere fragmented among different entities of the bureaucratic structure, \nsuggests that this approach provides a good theoretical starting point for \nunderstanding tourism policy-making more generally. \n 37\nREFERENCES \nAnderson, J.E. \n        2003 Public Policymaking: An Introduction.
