To eradicate these \nissues a closed technique has been developed which ensured a controlled geometry for both \nthe optical interfaces of the flowing liquid film. This had the action of preventing splashing, \nensuring repeatable machining conditions and allowed for control of liquid flow velocity. To \ninvestigate the performance benefits of this closed immersion technique bisphenol A \npolycarbonate samples have been machined using filtered water at a number of flow \nvelocities. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the closed immersion technique: a 93% \ndecrease in debris is produced when machining under closed filtered water immersion; the \naverage debris particle size becomes larger, with an equal proportion of small and medium \nsized debris being produced when laser machining under closed flowing filtered water \nimmersion; large debris is shown to be displaced further by a given flow velocity than \nsmaller debris, showing that the action of flow turbulence in the duct has more impact on \nsmaller debris. Low flow velocities were found to be less effective at controlling the \npositional trend of deposition of laser ablation generated debris than high flow velocities; but, \nuse of excessive flow velocities resulted in turbulence motivated deposition. This work is of \ninterest to the laser micromachining community and may aide in the manufacture of 2.5D \nlaser etched patterns covering large area wafers and could be applied to a range of \nwavelengths and laser types. \nIntroduction \nLaser ablation has proven to be a revolution in the micro and nano manufacturing industries \n[1-3]. Technology has been continuously refined and improved in terms of laser fluence, \noptical resolution and production speed since the emergence of the technique in the late \n1970\u201fs [3]. However, one area has continued to plague the laser ablation pattern machining \nsector: laser ablation generated debris [4]. Debris provides a number of technical obstacles: \nduring machining [5]; after machining [6]; to the production tooling and facility [7] and \npotentially to the health of the facility workers [8]. These above issues make an efficient and \ngeneral solution a desirable prospect. \nPreviously, the typical control solution for ablation generated debris is post process removal \nby the employment of one of a number of cleaning techniques: ultrasonic bathing [9], \nsurfactant jetting [10], contact scrubbing [11], laser cleaning passes [12] and chemical \ninteractions [13]. They are all limited in two ways: possible damage of a wafer that has \nalready had significant manufacturing effort expended upon it [12] and post process cleaning \ncan only remove debris left behind after machining has finished - it cannot prevent the effects \nof debris during machining. Because of this, an in-line technique is preferential. A number of \nin-line techniques have been detailed in literature that cover two main groups: positive \npressure gas jetting (using a number of flow geometries, ranging from crossflow to vortex \n[14, 15]) and vacuum gas removal [16].  \nAll of these variations on two themes are limited by one factor: the low viscosity of the fluid \nused as a debris control medium (typically air or N2 for shorter wavelength laser machining). \nLow viscosity dictates a low drag force is imparted by the flowing fluid onto the debris \nparticles to be controlled; thus, it is perceived that the use of a fluid with greater viscosity will \nperform more effectively [17]. \nMuch work has been conducted to glean understanding of the mechanism of adhesion \nbetween particles and surfaces. In a dry system, there are three primary adhesion forces: Van \nder Waals [18, 19]; electrostatic (of which there are two forms \u2013 long range (image forces) \n[20], and contact (double-layer) [21]); and capillary forces (where the surface tension of \nliquid meniscus between particles holds a particle to the surface [22]). Van der Waals and \nlong range electrostatic interactions act to attract a floating particle to a larger surface. Once \nlodged to the surface the action of Van der Waals, electrostatic double layer and capillary \nforces combine to adhere the particle to the surface [12]. The action of capillary adhesion can \nincrease the adhesion force by a factor of 5-7 and even prolonged baking in an attempt to \nevaporate the liquid forming the meniscus that binds a particle a surface only acts to increase \nthe adhesion force [23]. Immersion in water has been shown to reduce the Van der Waals \nattraction by as much as 50% [21] and will massively reduce or negate the action of capillary \nadhesion during immersion due to closer correlation of liquid viscosities between the \nadhesion meniscus and the immersing fluid [12].  The use of a conducting fluid for \nimmersion negates or even reverses the action of electrostatic forces by action of the Yukawa \nrepulsion [24]. \nFurther understanding can be gleaned by exploring the use of immersed ablation in other \napplications. A technique for delivering long wavelength laser radiation by use of a fine jet of \nwater proves that use of such mediums does not pose unacceptable attenuation of the beam \n[25]. Others [26] have used a novel technique known as laser induced backside wet etching \n(LIBWE), to machine laser wavelength transparent materials by passing the beam through \nand focussing it just beyond the far surface of the material that is immersed in a liquid \nmedium. The production of nano and micro particles has also caused immersion of the \nsample during lasing to be experimented with, proving to entirely capture all ablation \ngenerated debris [18, 19], so use of a liquid medium to control ablation generated debris \nduring machining appears achievable. Sattari et al. [27] used ablation of ceramics immersed \nin 4 to 6 mm of distilled water running at a constant flow rate of 116 ml\/min to produce a \ncontrolled collection of nanoparticles at the surface of the immersing liquid, Dowding and \nLawrence [28] cite the action of surface tension at the perimeter of microbubbles formed by \nablation plume gas trapped in the immersing liquid as a cause for larger colloidal debris \nproducts that are resultant of liquid immersed ablation [21, 29]. Particle productivity has been \nshown to be proportional to liquid flow velocity [27]. The dependence of particle size is less \nclear, Sattari et al. state that laser fluence was inversely proportional to the size of \nnanoparticles produced (supporting the dominance of a photomechanical etching mechanism \nof a confined ablation plume as described by Berthe et al [30]). Katto et al. [31] found that \nparticle size was governed by the wavelength of the laser (a result common with traditional \nlaser machining in gaseous mediums) and was proportional to the fluence of the beam. \nDowding and Lawrence [28] used open thin film immersion to successfully demonstrate \ncontrol of debris from the ablation spot, with 90% of debris found deposited downstream of \nthe ablation spot whilst using only a low flow velocity. The use of open immersion has \nsignificant limitations: surface ripple, rolling turbulence and limited flow velocity. Zhu et al. \n[32] have shown that the immersion depth has a critical influence on the interaction between \nthe laser beam and the material. This means that particles may be both generated and ejected \nin different ways, dependent on the flow thickness at a specific point in the beam cross-\nsection. \nOnce generated, debris particles experience a drag force that is proportional to the viscosity \nand velocity of the flow surrounding it [33]. The particles are ejected away from the substrate \nsurface at high velocity [34], and so considerable work must be imparted on the travelling \nparticle by the surrounding liquid to transform the particles original vector to that of the fluid \nflow. If the flow is rippled, some debris will have less working distance available for the \nliquid to impart work on the particles original vector than can be offered to other particles \nproduced at other locations in the cross section of the beam. \nInertial, capillary and viscous effects along with the proportionally large contribution of \nsurface tension (due to the small thickness of the film) combine within the flow at a \nmolecular scale to generate significant flow ripple. Also, the large gradient of drag between \nthe material-flow interface and the flow meniscus \u2013 ambient air interface causes a tendency \nfor eddies to develop within the flow that roll into the material surface. In an open flow, \nturbulence commences following a characteristic distance measured between the contact \npoint of a fluid on a flat plate and the point at which the flow becomes turbulent [33]; \nhowever, this case requires all dimensions of the flow, including film depth, to be large \ncompared to the characteristic distance. In the case of this flow, the meniscus defines the flow \ngeometry; thus, the effect of rolling eddies alone are not responsible for the deposition \npatterns evidenced by Dowding and Lawrence [28], where debris distribution appeared to lie \nin ripple patterns downstream of the feature machined. Instead, large inertial, capillary and \nviscous contributions complicated the flow path. \nA closed immersion technique dictates that the flow is confined within a duct; and so, in turn, \nwill significantly improve the efficiency of debris control. A closed immersion technique \nallows control of film thickness; hence, the ratio between laser beam etching and compressed \nplume etching can be modified, [32, 35-38]; thus, the ejection vector mode and velocity can \nalso be altered. A closed geometry immersion flow ensures the minimum traverse distance \nfor debris to travel and have work imparted on its original vector and speed as a constant. \nWang et al [39] have developed mathematical models to predict the impact of individual laser \nablation interactions on the resultant machined feature geometry and therefore the production \nof debris from the material. This work shows that minor modification to the beam focal point \ncan cause a marked change in the cross sectional geometry of the machined feature. This is \nan outcome that is confirmed by the poor geometry of the features machined using open thin \nfilm flowing liquid immersed KrF excimer laser ablation [28], which had a rippled and \nvariable surface. Furthermore, there is the ability to control (and increase) the flow velocity \nof the fluid though the duct; this will increase the drag force imparted on a debris particle by \nthe flow. Last, the symmetry of the closed immersion technique will remove the meniscus \ndominated flow characteristics present in the open immersion technique. Equal drag is \nimparted to all flow boundaries; hence the characteristic distance of a flow in a closed duct is \ndescribed by cross sectional dimensions. Lower turbulence means debris captured in the flow \nis less likely to collide with the duct walls and be deposited in an unwanted position. \n Experimental Procedures \nMaterial Details \nBisphenol A polycarbonate (Holbourne Plastics, Ltd), was as received in 1200 x 1000 mm\n2\n \nsheets of 0.5 mm thickness. Prior to excimer laser processing, the bisphenol A polycarbonate \nsheet was cut into rectangular sections of 8 x 12 mm\n2\n using scissors - a shear cutting \ntechnique which avoids production of debris. Protective cover sheets were then peeled off \neach sample. \nLaser Details and Experimental Set-Up. \nFor both closed immersion and ambient air processing, an excimer laser (LPX200; Lambda \nPhysique, GmbH) using KrF as the excitation medium was used to produce a beam with a \nwavelength of 248 nm. Thereafter, the beam was supplied to a laser micromachining centre \n(M8000; Exitech, Ltd), where it was passed through a stainless steel mask to produce a 201 x \n203 \u00b5m\n2\n rectangular image. The masked beam was then demagnified through a 4x optic \n(Francis Goodhall, Ltd) to produce an ablation spot with a depth of focus (DoF) of 6 \u03bcm. A \nprofile of the masked beam was obtained using a beam profiler (SP620U; Spiricon, Ltd), \nwhich showed that the beam shape had an even distribution, with only a slight positive skew \nacross the y-axis; demonstrating good positioning of the mask in the raw beam. \nFocus was found by narrowing the focal rage until satisfactory focus was achieved. Pulse \nenergy was measured out of focus, using a power meter head (J50LP-2; Molectron Detector, \nInc.) connected to a reader unit (Energy Max 400; Molectron Detector, Inc.). Spot energies \nwere measured six times for each sample \u2013 three times before the sample was machined and \nthree readings were taken after the sample was machined. Each reading was taken after the \nsystem attenuator had been reset. In this way any change in the beam between measurements \nand any inaccuracy in the positioning of the attenuator were accounted for. \nSix sites were machined on all samples, each produced using an increasing number of pulses \n(3, 6, 12, 60, 120 and 480 pulses) to produce an ablation rate matrix. The feature of interest \nfor debris analysis in this study was the feature machined using six pulses. Six pulses were \nused for producing the samples that are the subject of this work to allow direct comparison to \nsamples produced in earlier work by Dowding and Lawrence [28]. In this instance the beam \nwas attenuated by a tool attenuator set at 126\u00b0 from minimum transmission, resulting in a \nbeam fluence of 580.7 mJ\/cm\n1\n and 578.1 mJ\/cm\n1\n for ablation in ambient air and under \nfiltered water immersion respectively, that produced features of 203 x 205 \u00b5m\n2\n. This fluence \ndata was calculated from pulse energy data taken using the technique detailed above. \nAll features examined in this work had two neighbours: every one lying 200 \u00b5m away from \nthe sample on either side. Critically, these features are aligned across the direction of liquid \nflow. One feature is produced before each of the samples inspected in this work using just \nthree pulses, the feature inspected in this work is produced using six pulses, then following \nthis, another feature is machined to the right of the feature of interest using twelve pulses. \nThe use of neighbouring samples is important in the context of this work: when machining \nfeatures into a sample industrially, it is common for multiple features to be machined at \nseparate times or even during separate phases of manufacture [3]; thus, the importance of \npreventing cross contamination of debris produced from one feature impacting the quality of \nanother is high.  \nAmbient Air Laser Processing \nSamples machined in ambient air were produced using the same laser and micromachining \nequipment as the closed immersion ablation samples. The bisphenol A polycarbonate samples \nwere mounted directly to the vacuum chuck inside the micromachining station (M8000; \nExitech, Ltd). After lasing ended the sample was removed and placed into the cell of a sealed \nsample tray to protect them from atmospheric dust. \nClosed Thick Film Filtered Water Immersion Laser Processing Procedure \nFigure 1(a) describes the critical experimental layout of the sample once clamped inside the \nflow rig, which was mounted to the side of the sample vacuum chuck of the laser micro-\nprocessing centre (M8000; Exitech, Ltd.). The sample was positioned in the centre of the flat \naluminium table between the water supply and exit holes. The sample was retained by a \nrecess in a spacer plate (to provide a 1.5 mm thick water film) that lay in contact with the \naluminium sample table. An O-ring cord, located by a rectangular groove in the sample table, \nprovided a seal between the sample table and the spacer plate. On the top of the spacer plate a \nsecond oval O-ring groove was machined to locate another O-ring cord. This acted as a \ngasket between the spacer plate and the beam window \u2013 a 25 x 25 x 5 mm3 ultra-violet grade \nfused silica sheet (Comar Instruments, Ltd). The beam window was retained by a diamond \nshaped recess in a third aluminium plate, 8 mm in thickness to provide stiffness to the whole \nsandwich.  \nFigure 1(b) shows the water filtering and supply system. Water originated from normal mains \nsupply by wall tap. The water was poured into a domestic water filter (Britta, Inc.) situated at \nthe top the water supply assembly to remove typical corrosive elements present in mains \nwater. The water was then retained in a header tank located above the pump and, under the \naction of gravity, was forced into the 700 W pump chamber (CPE100P; Clarke Power \nProducts, Ltd.). The pump forced the water through a water flow rate meter (FR4500; Key \nInstruments, Inc.) and then along a 3 m distance through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to \nthe inlet push-in elbow fitting on the bottom of the sample table. Last, the water was returned \nalong a further 3 m through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to a collection bucket. The \npump was capable of producing 4.2 bar at the outlet, equating to a maximum flow velocity \nthrough the ablation chamber of 3.89 m\/s, given losses along the supply and return tubing. \nPrecise control of the flow velocity was provided by a variable valve in the flow-meter. Flow \nvelocities of 0.03, 0.11, 1.85, 2.78, 3.24 and  3.70 m\/s were used for this work.  \nSample Analysis Techniques \nFor numerical data to be produced from solid samples, a number of steps had to be taken to \nachieve the resolution of data across the broad area of samples machined for this work. Each \nsample was imaged digitally as an uncompressed bitmap in 9 sectors (bottom left, bottom, \nbottom right, left, centre, right, top left, top and top right) using reflective illumination and an \noptical microscope (Optiphot; Nikon Corp.), at 20x magnification onto a CCD photosensor \n(GXCAM-5; GT Vision, Ltd.). A blank micrograph was also taken to account for any dirt \nthat may have been present in the microscope optics and to record the image brightness \ngradient produced by the illumination technique. The sector images were then digitally \ncorrected in terms of brightness gradient and erroneous marks using software (Image Pro 6.2; \nMedia Cybernetics, Inc.) and the blank micrograph as a datum image. The corrected sector \nimages were then combined to a single, large, high resolution bitmap. This full colour bitmap \nwas then converted to a binary data plot using software (Visilog Xpert 6.1; Noesis, SA.) The \nnumerical data of the three samples produced by each processing condition were then \ncombined and averaged using code programmed in a matrix processing suite (MATLAB \n2008b; The MathWorks, Inc.) to produce six final data sets for samples produced in ambient \nair and under closed thick film filtered water immersion at flow velocities of: 0.03, 0.11,\n \n1.85,\n \n2.78 and\n \n3.70 m\/s). This final averaged data was separated into ten groups classified by area \nsize. This data could then be manipulated to produce general population density data, local \npopulation density data by sector or displacement data. \nResults and Discussion \nImpact of flowing closed thick film filtered water immersion on debris deposition with \ncomparison to samples machined in ambient air. \nThe distribution of debris generated by laser ablation in ambient air is dictated by the beam \nshape [28], as one can see from Figure 2(i),  Figure 3(i) and Figure 4(i), four high density \nmushroom shaped deposition areas can clearly be seen extending at a normal to the edges of \nthe square feature machined. Dowding and Lawrence have explored the relationship between \nbeam shape and debris distribution, finding that debris is ejected, then deposited at normals to \nlinear edges of features. This tendency for preferential debris distribution was repeated when \nusing triangular beam shapes and a circular beam geometry [28]. Debris has been shown to \nbe transported in the laser ablation plume shockwave [40, 41], the deposition patterns \nwitnessed have a beam shape dependency because separate shockwaves, generated and \nexpanding simultaneously from different locations in the beam, collide and intersect as they \nexpand; depositing debris either at the location of shockwave collision or at the periphery of \nindividual shockwave range [28]. For a square, four seed points form separate shockwaves, \none from each corner of the feature, as described in Figure 5. As these expand they intersect, \ndropping debris as they collide in the shaded areas indicated. \nThe existence of a neighbour is obvious for the sample shown in Figure 2(i), which was \nmachined in ambient air. Debris from the sample\u201fs neighbour to the right has been deposited \nalong with the debris of the feature being inspected to produce a significantly increased \ndebris density to the right of the feature. The same cross contamination is not evident for any \nof the closed thick film filtered water immersion samples (Figure 2(ii) to Figure 2(v)). This \nwork demonstrates that the use of closed thick film filtered water immersion changes the \nprimary parameters that dictate the deposition trend of debris from a group of ablation \ncharacteristics that are difficult for a user to control, to a set of separate flow parameters that \nare easy for the user to control independently of the laser ablation mechanisms used for \nmachining. \nFigure 3 and Figure 4 are groups of contour plots representing the total particle population \ndensity per 486.6 \u00b5m\n2\n area (which corresponds to a 10000 pixel box). Figure 3 shows contour \nplots for all the samples seen in Figure 2. Figure 3(i) clearly demonstrates the characteristic \nhigh density distinct deposition pattern of the sample machined in ambient air; this \ndistribution pattern is not present on any of the closed thick film filtered water immersion \nablated samples shown in Figure 3(ii) to Figure 3(v). This removal of high density localized \ndeposited debris smears was caused by the action of increased suspension and subsequent \nretention of particulate debris by filtered water immersion. Furthermore, drag imparted on the \nparticles was much greater when using filtered water, a fluid offering two orders of \nmagnitude greater viscosity than air [33], afforded a marked increase in removal of debris \nfrom the sample. \nThe results produced using closed thick film flowing filtered water immersed KrF excimer \nlaser ablation shown in Figure 2 show that the features machined are regular and repeatable \nand the debris deposition patterning is minimal. This is in contrast to the performance of open \nthin film liquid immersed KrF laser ablation machining attempted previously [28], where the \ngeometry of the features machined and the debris deposition patterns produced were non-\nrepeatable. This confirms that use of a closed duct to confine the geometry of the flowing \nimmersion fluid results in greatly increased stability and repeatability of the laser ablation \nmechanism. \nImpact of closed thick film filtered water immersion on total debris population. \nA visual comparison of particle numbers present on the samples is given by Figure 4. \nComparison of Figure 4(i) to the closed thick film filtered water immersion machined \nsamples (Figure 4(ii) to Figure 4(v)) demonstrates a marked difference in deposited debris \npopulation: the legends show a 96% reduction of the debris population generated by ablation \nin ambient air when closed thick film filtered water immersion was applied. \nPreviously [28] it has been found that the use open de ionized (DI) water immersion ablation \nproduced proportionally fewer small debris than ablation in ambient air; a greatly increased \nproportional population of medium debris particles and a similarly small proportion of large \ndebris. The same analysis has been conducted on the closed thick film filtered water \nimmersion samples in this work and compared to samples machined in ambient air. Figure 6 \ndemonstrates that the total debris population size produced when using closed thick film \nfiltered water immersion ablation across all size classes (see detail plot given inside Figure \n6), at any flow velocity, was 4603 compared to the 65553 produced by ablation in ambient \nair. This is a reduction in debris deposition across the inspected surface of 93%. The use of \nclosed thick film filtered water immersion was even more effective at reducing debris \ndeposition in terms of frequency than the open technique described by Dowding and \nLawrence [28]. Once again, debris deposition for closed thick film filtered water immersion \nis dictated by the flow parameters of the immersion liquid. \nFeature floor characteristics. \nWhen machining using ambient air as a medium, the debris was ejected away from the \nfeature, as evidenced by Figure 2(i). Whereas all features machined in ambient air showed an \neven and clear floor, as can be clearly seen in Figure 2(ii) to Figure 2(iv) and Figure 7(a). All \nsamples machined under closed thick film filtered water immersion ablation displayed a dark, \nopaque floor, as shown in Figure 7(b). Under flowing closed thick film filtered water \nimmersion, the debris was also ejected outwards in all directions, including the upstream \ndirection; this debris was assumed to be forced back over the feature by the oncoming flow of \nimmersing filtered water. It was assumed turbulent eddies, caused by the step change in \nsurface level at the feature wall, deposited debris on the feature floor. To confirm this, a \nsample machined using closed filter water immersion ablation was cleaned using ultra-sonic \nbath excitation, a well documented technique of removing a wide range of particulate sizes \nfrom a surface [13]. The result of cleaning the sample for 10 minutes in fresh DI water \ndemonstrated identical floor patterning before (Figure 7(b)) and after (Figure 7(c)) treatment. \nThis shows that the apparent darkening of the feature floor is not a result of debris, rather it is \nthe result of an alteration to machined surface topography by the action of closed thick film \nfiltered water immersion machining. The micrographs used in this work rely on reflective \nlighting, therefore increased diffusion of the light by the sample feature floor would make it \nappear darker. This will be investigated in more exhaustive detail in a future publication. \nImpact of flow velocity on deposition trend. \nThe results displayed in Figure 8 show the number of particles of three specific size ranges \nfor each closed thick film filter water immersion flow velocity tested discretely by use of \ncontour plot. Each group of result plots have been generated by taking a mean average of the \ndeposition frequency of three separate machined samples to guard against experimental \ninaccuracy. The full results are split into 10 debris particle size classes, with the smallest, \nmiddling and second largest (1\nst\n, 5\nth\n and 9\nth\n) debris size plots being given for illustration of \nthe findings of this work. \nAgain, all closed thick film filtered water immersion ablation sample results shown in Figure \n8(b - f) show a contrast to the typical ambient air deposition tendency displayed in Figure \n8(a). None of the closed thick film filtered water immersion samples, that were all produced \nusing different flow velocities, display either the high deposition density or the characteristic \ndebris size distribution (that was dominated by a majority of small debris). The closed thick \nfilm filtered water immersion samples (Figure 8(b) to Figure 8(f)) all show an equal \npopulation of both small and medium size debris and a proportionally increased population of \nlarge debris deposited when compared to the samples produced in ambient air. \nWhen inspecting and comparing the debris distribution of the closed thick film filtered water \nimmersion samples there is an obvious contrast in distribution between the three high flow \nvelocity samples displayed in Figure 8(b) to Figure 8(d) produced using 3.70, 2.78, and 1.85 \nm\/s respectively, and the lower flow velocity samples shown in Figure 8(e) and Figure 8(f) \nthat were produced using 0.11 and 0.03 m\/s respectively. The higher flow velocity samples \nall demonstrate a clear propensity for debris deposition downstream of the feature, whereas \nthe low flow velocity samples both appear to show an even distribution upstream and around \nto the sides of the feature across the direction of the flow. The samples displayed in Figure \n8(f) also show a significant population of debris upstream. This would suggest that the \ntendency for debris to be deflected and transported by a liquid is directly dependent upon the \nliquid flow velocity. This interpretation is strongly supported by close inspection of the high \nflow velocity samples: increased flow velocity, such as the plot in Figure 8(b), results in \ndecreased debris deposition, as can be identified by the magnitude of frequencies registered \nin the legends for each group of plots. Flow turbulence also appears to become important, as \none can see from Figure 8(b), where stream lines of debris can be identified for the medium \nsized debris to the top right of the feature. \nThe Reynolds numbers of the flows in this chamber have been calculated using both \nrectangular duct and parallel plate approximations; these have been plotted in Figure 9. All of \nthe samples machined at a high liquid flow velocity experienced turbulence in the flowing \nfiltered water medium. The two samples machined at lower flow velocities were both \nmachined in the laminar regime. Turbulence generated at high flow velocities may cause \ndebris particles trapped in the flow of water to be directed back towards the sample surface \ndownstream of its production and ejection site. Increased flow velocity results in increased \nturbulence [33]: thus it stands to reason that a greater proportion of debris deposited at high \nflow velocities will be deposited as a result of turbulence. The results for the high flow \nvelocity samples in Figure 8(b-d) support this hypothesis, showing an inverse relationship \nbetween total debris population size and flow velocity, but more localized streak pattern \ngrouping of debris downstream of the feature as the flow velocity was increased. The samples \nproduced using laminar flows do not show this characteristic, instead they demonstrate a \nmore even deposition trend. Reduced flow velocity even allows deposition upstream of the \nfeature, as can be seen in Figure 8(f), suggesting that this flow velocity only offers a level of \ncontrol to maintain suspension of the ejected debris in the fluid, rather than providing strong \npositional control also. \nImpact of flow velocity on debris population by size class \nFigure 10 shows the population size of debris produced using immersed ablation with respect \nto debris size class. The results given in Figure 10 make it clear that increased flow velocity \nresults in decreased deposition frequency. This is perhaps to be expected as increased flow \nvelocity means increased drag on particulates to provide motive force upon them, despite any \nturbulence issues discussed above. Figure 10 also demonstrates that low flow velocity, \nlaminar closed thick film filtered water immersion produced a majority population of medium \nsized (1.765 \u2013 28.46 \u00b5m2) debris particles. This result can be attributed to the action of \ncolloidal debris interaction, as described by others [21, 28, 31]. Closed thick film filtered \nwater immersion produces a larger majority of medium sized debris than that displayed by \nopen thin film immersion [28]:  the closed technique provided a more stable medium \ngeometry for particles to interact and combine within. Use of open thin film immersion \ncaused potential cohesion to be avoided by the action of medium rupture and splashing. A \nclosed thick film filtered water immersion structure allows more of the small debris to \ncombine to form medium size colloids [12]. Large multiple colloid debris are uncommon:  \nthe adhesion forces become overwhelmed by the action of gravity and drag forces for \nparticles larger than 5 \u00b5m in diameter [9], a value at which the population sizes drop off \nrapidly in Figure 10, instead they gather small debris, explaining the low small debris \npopulation. Generally, increased flow velocity results in reduced total debris population; \nhowever the samples machined at the lowest flow velocity (0.03 m\/s) do not follow this \ntrend, showing a smaller population than the immediately higher flow velocity. The lowest \nflow velocity used was chosen as it resulted in a flow velocity insufficient to traverse the \nentire length of the feature between pulses, hence debris suspended in the flow produced by \none pulse would obstruct the course of the following pulse, thus resulting in decreased \naverage fluence across the feature. This would reduce the laser etch rate and therefore the \nvolume of debris produced by the lowest flow velocity in a way not experienced by the 0.11 \nm\/s samples. This is what causes the abnormally low debris population of the lowest flow \nvelocity. \nRelationship between debris size and deposition displacement \nTo interpret the action flowing closed thick film filtered water immersion had on debris with \nrespect to positional control of deposition, the distribution of deposition displacement from \nthe site of production by particle frequency with respect to debris particle size and flow \nvelocity was inspected. This can be deduced effectively using two differing techniques. \nA statistical technique can be used: distribution skew, a numerical value that denotes the \nshape of the distribution about the mean of a frequency distribution. A positive skew value is \nthe result of a distribution where a greater proportion of the population lies between the mean \nand infinity; a negative skew value is the result of a distribution where a greater proportion of \nthe population lies between the origin and the mean. A large magnitude of skew denotes a \nstrong population \u201elean\u201f about the mean, a lower skew value denotes a distribution of the \npopulation that is more evenly balanced about the mean. In Figure 11, plots of the magnitude \nof skew for all the immersed samples are displayed with respect to displacement from the top \nedge of the feature as viewed in Figure 2. The plots of the samples machined in turbulent \nflow displayed in Figure 11 all show correlating trends. Small debris has a large positive \nskew, which drops away to a smaller positive skew for medium size debris. This means the \ndisplacement of debris before deposition increases with size. This finding is contrary to the \nexpected trend, where the ratio of surface area to volume decreases with size, causing the \naction of drag against mass dominated inertia to reduce with increasing particle size. An \nexplanation of this interesting trend can be given using turbulence and adhesion science: the \naction of turbulence does not effect large debris as easily as small debris due to the \ncontrasting relationships between size, surface area and mass; thus, large debris more readily \nfollows the general vector of the flow than small debris and is therefore less commonly \nsmeared onto the sample surface [32]. Also, the drag on a particle with respect to the size of \nthe adhesion forces acting upon it will be favourable for easy removal of larger debris [12]. \nThe samples produced using laminar flow velocities display much less predictable plots, but \nbroadly follow those of the turbulent flow velocity samples suggesting that the immersing \nliquid volume provides less stable debris transportation mode than the turbulent flows, \nperhaps as a result of the interaction of ablation plumes generated by subsequent laser pulses \nwith the surrounding immersion fluid before it has fully cleared the feature location. It must \nbe noted that the skew measure is limited to only the lower seven debris sizes as there are \nfewer large particles available for reliable plots above the debris particle size of 129 \u00b5m\n2\n. \nAnother, less simple measurement of the positional tendency was made to verify the previous \nstatistical analysis. The centre position of the debris population density peak can be plotted \nfor each designated debris size class. This information is plotted for each flow velocity in \nFigure 12. These plots tally well with indications presented by the skew magnitude data, \nwhere the displacement of the debris from the top edge of the machined feature increases \nwith debris size up to a maximum debris size of 129 \u00b5m\n2\n. However, the use of the median \nmeasure of the top 5% of the normalized frequency distribution allows interpretation of the \nlarger debris deposition displacement. Inspection of these points shows the larger debris is \ndeposited with larger displacement from the machined feature than small debris. The \nunreliable trend demonstrated by the skew measurement for laminar flow velocities in Figure \n11 is more interpretable when plotted using the median measure of the top 5% of the \nnormalized frequency distribution shown in Figure 12. This data appears to tie well with the \ntrend of increased displacement for medium sized debris over smaller debris in the same flow \nconditions for debris up to 129 \u00b5m\n2\n in area; however, the data becomes unreliable for larger \ndebris sizes due to small numbers making this measurement technique susceptible to \nsignificant distortion by outliers. \nIn Figure 11 the flow velocity of 1.85 m\/s has the largest magnitude of positive skew; in \nFigure 12, it has the highest displacement for every size class of debris measured. This \ndemonstrates that the optimum flow velocity for maximum displacement of debris before \ndeposition occurs at 1.85 m\/s. The 3.70 and 2.78 m\/s samples display similar displacements \nfor each debris size class as the laminar flow samples. This can be attributed to the effect of \nturbulence causing unnecessary deposition at excessive flow velocities and a lack of motive \nforce for transportation of debris species at very low flow velocities; thus leaving an \nintermediate flow velocity acting as the best compromise. \nConclusions \nThe average bisphenol A polycarbonate sample machined using ablation under closed thick \nfilm filtered water immersion deposited just 7% of the volume of debris generated when \nmachining  in ambient air. What is more, samples produced using closed thick film filtered \nwater immersion techniques outperform open thin film techniques experimented with in \nprevious work in terms of debris removal. There are three contributing reasons for this \nproposed. Firstly, the prevention of fluid rupture by the closed geometry of the duct that the \nliquid flows through ensures a more stable and repeatable ablation mechanism than can be \nachieved in open thin film immersion. Secondly, the drag imparted on the flow by a closed \nduct is symmetrical, unlike the drag on a liquid flowing across a plate; hence rolling \nturbulence is not generated by the closed technique and the suspended particulates are not \nguided into the sample surface. Thirdly, a small contribution to the lower deposition rate of \nthe closed technique inspected in this work could be the action of subtle differences in the \nchemical composition of the differing fluids used in this work compared to the de ionized \nwater used in the open thin film immersion ablation. \nThe debris deposition trend of bisphenol A polycarbonate samples machined using ablation \nunder closed thick film filtered water immersion display none of the characteristic mushroom \ndeposition patterns that are generated by ablation of bisphenol A polycarbonate in ambient \nair, showing that use of ablation under closed thick film filtered water immersion changes the \ndeposition positional tendency from being a variable of the beam shape to a variable of fluid \nflow. The use of ablation under closed thick film filtered water immersion even prevent the \ncumulative deposition of close proximity neighbours lying across the direction of flow, \nfurther underlining the control of species generated by ablation using closed thick film \nfiltered water immersion. \nThe use of frequency scaled intensity distribution contour plots demonstrated that both the \ntotal population of debris and the deposition positional tendency are effected by immersion \nliquid flow velocity. Most obviously, there is significant difference between the particulate \ndistribution generated by turbulent flow velocity and laminar flow velocity; turbulent flow \nguides debris downstream effectively, laminar flow merely causes the debris to achieve a \nmore even distribution than that given by ambient air. The population size of debris produced \nis inversely proportional to the flow velocity. For high flow velocity regimes an increase in \nflow velocity of 100% from 1.85\n \nto 3.70 m\/s results in a 33.8% decrease in total debris \npopulation size. Laminar flow velocity resulted in larger total debris population, with an \naverage total debris population 156% greater than the total population of the lowest turbulent \nflow velocity. Of significance is the observation that the population of debris is greater for the \nhigher laminar flow velocity. This is proposed to be caused by the interaction of suspended \ndebris in the flow with the ablation plume: at very low flow velocities the suspended debris \nintercepts the beam en-route to the feature, lowering the laser fluence across the feature area, \nreducing the etch rate of the material achieved and therefore the volume of debris produced. \nAt the increased laminar flow velocity, the suspended debris is displaced more rapidly, \npreventing beam interception by suspended debris, allowing maximum laser etching. \nThe use of closed thick film filtered water immersion modified the typical debris population \nby size class. Ablation in ambient air generated a large majority of small sized particulate \ndebris; ablation under closed thick film filtered water immersion negated this majority of \nsmall sized debris, as an equal proportion of the total debris population were medium sized \nparticles. Large particles were still found to be uncommon when using closed thick film \nfiltered water immersion ablation. This change in debris size population trend is accredited to \nthe action of colloidal particle interactions, where small debris was collected across the walls \nof gas micro-bubbles in the immersing liquid volume, which were generated as the ablation \nplume dispersed. As the micro-bubble gas cools and contracts the action of capillary and van \nder Waals forces bind the collection of small particles to form a single medium sized \ncolloidal item. Once formed these colloidal particles tend not to combine to form large debris, \nas the small adhesion forces are not high enough in magnitude to reliably bind these together. \nThe interaction between debris with regards to size and any given flow velocity is also \ninteresting. Measures of frequency distribution skew magnitude and inspection of the median \nof the 95 percentile of the normalised distribution of the debris frequency demonstrate that \nlarge debris is displaced further by any given turbulent flow than a small debris particle. This \nis a confusing result when considering the drag imparted by a flow onto a particle with \nrespect to that particles mass. It is proposed that the action of turbulence does not effect large \ndebris as easily as small debris: large debris follows the general vector of the flow more \nreadily than small debris and is therefore less commonly smeared onto the sample surface. \nAlso, the drag on a particle with respect to the size of the adhesion forces acting upon it will \nbe favourable for easy removal of larger debris. This analysis technique also showed that \nthere was an optimum removal flow velocity, where the displacement of any given debris \nsize was at a maximum in the filtered water medium. This flow velocity is shown to be \napproximately 1.85 m\/s. \nReferences \n1. Rizvi, N.

There were too few large debris particles measured to give reliable data \nfor this type of analysis. \n \nFigure 12: Another useful graphical technique to demonstrate the shift in distribution of the \ndebris with increasing debris size: this time using the median of 95\nth\n percentile of normal \ndistribution of distribution frequency data. \nFigure 1 \n \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n6 \na) \n1 \n2 3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nb) \nFigure 2 \n \nFigure 3 \n \nFigure 4 \n \nFigure 5 \n \ndeposition \nFigure 6 \n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\n40000\n45000\n50000\n0<\nA<\n0.6\n61\n8\n0.4\n41\n2<\nA<\n1.1\n03\n0.8\n82\n4<\nA<\n1.9\n85\n1.7\n65\n<A\n<3\n.75\n0\n3.5\n30\n<A\n<7\n.28\n0\n7.0\n59\n<A\n<1\n4.3\n4\n14\n.12\n<A\n<2\n8.4\n6\n28\n.24\n<A\n<5\n6.6\n9\n56\n.47\n<A\n<1\n13\n.2\n11\n2.9\n<A\n<2\n26\n.1\nParticle Area 'A' (\u00b5m\n2\n)\nD\neb\nri\ns \nF\nre\nq\nu\nen\ncy\n0.11 m\/s\n0.03 m\/s\n1.85 m\/s\n2.78 m\/s\n3.70 m\/s\nAmbient Air\n \n \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n0<\nA<\n0.6\n61\n8\n0.4\n41\n2<\nA<\n1.1\n03\n0.8\n82\n4<\nA<\n1.9\n85\n1.7\n65\n<A\n<3\n.75\n0\n3.5\n30\n<A\n<7\n.28\n0\n7.0\n59\n<A\n<1\n4.3\n4\n14\n.12\n<A\n<2\n8.4\n6\n28\n.24\n<A\n<5\n6.6\n9\n56\n.47\n<A\n<1\n13\n.2\n11\n2.9\n<A\n<2\n26\n.1\nDetail plot \nFigure 7 \n \n \nFigure 8 \n \n0 \u2264 Debris \nArea (\u00b5m2) \u2264 \n0.3375 \n1.913 \u2264 Debris \nArea (\u00b5m2) \u2264 \n3.713 \n28.91 < Debris \nArea (\u00b5m2) \n<57.71 \n  \nAmbient \nAir \n \n(a) \n \n \n \n \n \n0.0333 \n(m\/s) \n= \n3.70 \n(m\/s) \n \n(b) \n \n \n0.0250 \n(m\/s) \n= \n2.78 \n(m\/s) \n \n(c) \n \n0.0167 \n(m\/s) \n= \n1.85 \n(m\/s) \n \n(d) \n \n0.0010 \n(m\/s) \n= \n0.11 \n(m\/s) \n \n(e) \n \n0.00025 \n(m\/s) \n= \n0.03 \n(m\/s) \n \n(f) \n \n \n \n  \nF\nlo\nw\n v\ne\nlo\nc\nit\ny\n (\n0\n.0\n3\n  \nto\n 3\n.7\n0\n m\n\/\ns\n) \n \nDebris Size \nFigure 9 \n \n \nFigure 10 \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n0<\nA<\n0.6\n61\n8\n0.4\n41\n2<\nA<\n1.1\n03\n0.8\n82\n4<\nA<\n1.9\n85\n1.7\n65\n<A\n<3\n.75\n0\n3.5\n30\n<A\n<7\n.28\n0\n7.0\n59\n<A\n<1\n4.3\n4\n14\n.12\n<A\n<2\n8.4\n6\n28\n.24\n<A\n<5\n6.6\n9\n56\n.47\n<A\n<1\n13\n.2\n11\n2.9\n<A\n<2\n26\n.1\nParticle Area, A (\u00b5m\n2\n)\nD\neb\nri\ns \nF\nr\neq\nu\nen\ncy\nFilter 3.70 m\/s\nFilter 2.78 m\/s\nFilter 1.85 m\/s\nFilter 0.11 m\/s\nFilter 0.03 m\/s\n \nFigure 11 \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00 12.00 14.00 16.00\nDebris Area (\u00b5m\n2\n)\nM\na\ng\nn\nit\nu\nd\ne \no\nf \nS\nk\new\n3.70 m\/s\n2.78 m\/s\n1.85 m\/s\n0.11 m\/s\n0.03 m\/s\n \nFigure 12 \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n0.66 1.10 1.99 3.75 7.28 14.34 28.46 56.69 113.17 220.82\nDebris Area (\u00b5m\n2\n)\nD\nis\np\nla\nc\nem\nen\nt \n(\u00b5\nm\n)\n3.70 m\/s\n2.78 m\/s\n1.85 m\/s\n0.11 m\/s\n0.03 m\/s\n \n"}
