Here we demonstrate a giant electrocaloric effect (5 K in 25 V) in 260 nm\nsol-gel films of the relaxor ferroelectric 0.9 PbMg1\/3Nb2\/3O3 \u2013 0.1 PbTiO3 near the\nCurie temperature of 60oC. This reduction in operating temperature widens the\npotential for applications in novel cooling systems.\nIntroduction\nWe have recently demonstrated [OurScience] a giant electrocaloric (EC) effect\nin thin film PbZr0.95Ti0.05O3 (PZT) [Sawaguchi], with a peak \uf044T = 12 K at 226oC.\nThis high working temperature could permit cooling applications in the automotive,\naerospace or food industries, but a lower working temperature would open up many\nmore possibilities, e.g. on-chip refrigeration. Lower temperatures are also attractive\nbecause thin films fatigue less quickly and possess higher breakdown fields. Here we\ndemonstrate an EC effect in 0.9 PbMg1\/3Nb2\/3O3 - 0.1 PbTiO3 (0.9 PMN-0.1 PT)\n[Smolensky] films that peaks at the significantly lower temperature of 75oC.\nRelaxor ferroelectrics could be attractive for cooling applications for three\nreasons. Firstly, some\/many\/most\/all relaxor films such as 0.9 PMN - 0.1 PT show\npronounced pyroelectricity [ChoiBhalla, DavisSetter], suggesting that the converse\nEC effect is strong. Secondly, phase transitions in relaxors are broad so the range of\noperating temperatures is wide. Thirdly, relaxors show low hysteresis losses.\nHowever, the potential for relaxor ferroelectric films in cooling applications has not\nbeen considered.\nPbMg1\/3Nb2\/3O3 \u2013 PbTiO3 thin films\nThe PMN-PT family, based on the relaxor PMN [Smolensky], has already\nbeen proposed for many applications [YeShirane, ChoiBhalla, ViehlandLi,\nDavisSetter]. The PMN-rich relaxors, and compositions near the morphotropic phase\nboundary at 0.65 PMN - 0.35 PT, are [promising for\/used in] capacitors due to their\nlarge dielectric constant, and [also] [promising for\/used in] high-strain\nactuators\/transducers and prototype microelectromechanical systems due to their\npiezoelectric properties [YeShirane].\nBulk 0.9 PMN - 0.1 PT is a rhombohedral (pseudocubic) relaxor ferroelectric\nat room temperature [YeShirane, ZekriaGlazer]. On heating above TC ~ 60\u00baC, this\nstructure transforms to a cubic paraelectric phase [Smolensky, YeShirane,\nZekriaGlazer]. Because the material is a relaxor, the corresponding peak in the\ndielectric constant is frequency dependent [Smolensky], and broad due to microscopic\ninhomogenities [Smolensky, ChoiBhalla]. The pyroelectric properties of PMN\nceramics under high DC bias fields have been studied for thermal IR detector\napplications [WhatmorePyro]. There is no data for PMN-PT thin films at the\ntemperatures and high electric fields of interest, the EC effect could not be predicted\nfrom the literature.\nExperimental\n0.9 PMN - 0.1 PT sols were prepared from Sigma-Aldrich precursors. A\nmixture of Pb(OAc)2\u00b73H2O and Mg(OAc)2 was dissolved in acetic acid and distilled\nat 100oC for 30 minutes. 20% excess Pb and 5% excess Mg were added to\ncompensate for losses during sintering. Separately, acetic acid and 2-methoxyethanol\nwere added to a mixture of Nb(OEt)5 and Ti(OnBu)4 and the resulting solution was\nstirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The Pb\/Mg and Nb\/Ti based solutions\nwere mixed and stirred at room temperature. Formamide was added to the final\nsolution to prevent cracking during sintering.\nSols were passed through a 0.2 \uf06dm filter for spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s\nonto Pt(111)\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si(100) substrates that had been rinsed with acetone, and\npropanol. Layers of ~50 nm were obtained by pre-firing in air on a hotplate at 350oC\nfor 30 s, and then further annealing in a tube furnace at 750oC for 3 minutes. This\nprocedure was repeated five times to obtain ~260 nm films.\nFilm structure was determined by x-ray diffraction on a Philips diffractometer\nusing Cu K\uf061 radiation. \u03b8-2\u03b8 scans corresponded to a polycrystalline perovskite phase\nwith no preferred orientations. The amount of pyrochlore phase was ~8%. Pt top\nelectrodes of diameter 0.2 mm were sputter deposited through a mechanical mask, and\nthe bottom Pt electrode was contacted with silver dag at a substrate edge. The\ndielectric constant and loss tangent were measured using a HP 4192A Impedance\nAnalyser at 100 kHz and 100 mV ac amplitude. Hysteresis measurements were\ncarried out at 10 kHz using a Radiant Technologies Precision Premier workstation and\na low temperature (80oC to -200oC) probe station. The temperature of the sample was\ncontrolled via feedback from a thermocouple, accurate to 0.3oC, in contact with the\nsample.\nResults and interpretation\nElectrical hysteresis measurements were made roughly every T=10oC in the\nrange 80oC to -200oC, on cooling to minimise reductions in P due to fatigue. Fig. 1\nshows the expected [Smolensky] ferroelectric P(E) at 75oC, where the EC effect\npeaks as shown later. Only one loop is shown because our measurements of P(E) in\n80oC to -200oC varied by just a few percent, and are therefore visually similar.\nHowever, we show below that this is sufficient to produce a giant EC effect. The real\npart of the dielectric constant \u03b5 measured on cooling has a broad peak at TC=60oC\nassociated with the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition (Fig. 1, upper inset). This\nbroadness is typical of relaxors due to microscopic inhomogeneity. It is also typical of\nthin films due to interfacial strain, scalar concentration gradients, or other forms of\nmicroscopic variability [Smolensky, Jim].\nReversible adiabatic temperature changes \uf044T due to an applied electric field E,\nfor a material of density \uf072 with heat capacity C are given [Tuttle] by:\nassuming the Maxwell relation (\uf0b6P\/\uf0b6T)E = (\uf0b6S\/\uf0b6E)T. Values of \uf0b6P\/\uf0b6T were obtained\nfrom 6th order polynomial fits to P(T) data (Fig. 2, inset). Fatigue may only reduce our\nvalues of |\uf0b6P\/\uf0b6T| since the data were taken on cooling such that P increased in\nsuccessive hysteresis measurements. In the temperature range of interest, the heat\ncapacity C = 120 J mol-1 K-1 remains sensibly constant or even decreases at low\ntemperatures [GorevHeatCap]. We note that assuming a constant value of C despite\na ~50% peak [Tuttle] resulted in excellent agreement with direct EC measurements of\n\uf044T in bulk Pb0.99Nb0.02(Zr0.75Sn0.20Ti0.05)0.98O3 [TuttlePayne]. We assume the bulk\nvalue of \uf072\uf020 = 8.08 g cm-3 [SatoDensity]\uf02e\nEC temperature changes obtained with (1) are presented in Fig. 2. The largest\nchange at TPeak=75oC (5 K in 25 V, i.e. 0.2 K V-1) exceeds the previous best results at\nthese temperatures obtained in bulk PMN-PT at 14oC (1 K in 160 V, i.e. 0.006 K V-1)\nand bulk PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 at 20oC (1.5 K in 1500 V, i. e. 0.001 K V-1) [Shebanov].\nOur peak EC temperature change of \uf044T = 5 K, determined with\nE = 895 kV cm-1, represents a peak energy change C\uf044T = 1.86 kJ kg-1. The\ncorresponding hysteresis loss was 24% of this figure, as determined from the area of\nthe 75oC hysteresis loop in E>0. Hysteresis losses may be reduced\n[ViehlandHystFreq] by (i) reducing the measurement frequency, (ii) introducing\nchemical substituents, and (iii) process control to modify microstructure.\n,\n1\n'0\n'dE\nT\nP\nT\nC\nT\nE\nE\n\uf0f2 \uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf03d\uf044 \uf072\nLeakage current was measured at TPeak = 75oC under our maximum value of\nE=895 kV cm-1 (Fig. 1, lower inset). Reliable measurements were not possible beyond\n10 ms, at which time the leakage current has fallen to 4 \uf06dA. However, the graph\nshows that transient currents continue to fall at this measurement time. Therefore\n4 \uf06dA represents an upper bound on the steady-state leakage current. A current of this\nmagnitude generates a Joule heating of 0.1 K over one quarter of a cycle. This is\nnegligible compared with the peak EC effect of 5 K.\nWe have demonstrated here a giant EC effect in the relaxor ferroelectric\n0.9 PMN - 0.1 PT. The effect peaks at 75oC, which is nearer to room temperature than\nthe giant peak found for PZT at 226oC [OurScience]. Reducing the PT content in\nPMN-PT is known to reduce the ferroelectric transition temperature to ~0oC in pure\nPMN [Smolensky]. This suggests a means by which to achieve significant EC effects\nat even lower temperatures.\nAcknowledgements.
