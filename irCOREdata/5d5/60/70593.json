In monolayer graphene, the low-energy charge carriers are chiral\nparticles exhibiting Berry\u2019s phase \u03c0 with a linear energy-versus-momentum relation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The\nchirality is based on a \u2018pseudospin\u2019 quantum number arising from the relative phase of the electronic wave\nfunction on adjacent atomic sites of the hexagonal lattice and chirality means that the pseudospin always\nlies parallel or antiparallel to the electron\u2019s momentum. The behaviour of low-energy particles in bilayer\ngraphene is perhaps even more remarkable [7, 8, 9]. They have a parabolic dispersion relation and a degree\nof chirality related to Berry\u2019s phase 2\u03c0, with the pseudospin linked to, but turning twice as quickly as, the\ndirection of momentum.\nIt has been possible to describe the electronic band structure of bilayer graphene using both the tight-\nbinding model [10, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14] and density functional theory [15, 16, 17]. It has been predicted [7]\nthat asymmetry between the on-site energies in the layers will create a gap \u2206 between the conduction and\nvalence bands. As the gap \u2206 arises from layer asymmetry, there is a possibility of tuning its magnitude\nusing external gates. Indeed, a gate is routinely used in experiments to control the density of electrons\nn on the bilayer system [1, 2, 8] and, in general, this will produce a simultaneous change in \u2206. The\ndependence of the gap on external gate voltage has been modelled taking into account screening within\nthe tight binding model [13, 14, 17]. It seems that such calculations produce good agreement with ARPES\nexperiments [9], measurements made in the regime of the quantum Hall effect [14], and density functional\ntheory calculations [17].\nIn the following, we review the tight-binding model of bilayer graphene in Section 2, including trigonal\nwarping effects. We obtain the effective low energy Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene in Section 3 and we\nshow that it is dominated by chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0. Section 4\ndescribes the opening of a gap in bilayer graphene due to layer asymmetry, followed by a calculation using\na self-consistent Hartree approximation to describe the control of the gap in the presence of an external\ngate.\n2 The tight-binding model of bilayer graphene Bilayer graphene consists of two coupled hexagonal\nlattices with inequivalent sites A1, B1 and A2, B2 on the bottom and top graphene sheets, respectively,\n\u2217 Corresponding author: e-mail: ed.mccann@lancaster.ac.uk\npss data will be provided by the publisher\n2 E. McCann: Interlayer asymmetry gap in bilayer graphene\narranged according to Bernal (A2-B1) stacking: as shown in Fig. 1(a), every B1 site in the bottom layer\nlies directly below an A2 site in the upper layer, but sites A1 and B2 do not lie directly below or above\na site in the other layer. We use the tight-binding model of graphite [18] by adapting the Slonczewski-\nWeiss-McClure parameterization [19, 20] of relevant couplings in order to model bilayer graphene. In-\nplane hopping is parameterized by coupling \u03b3A1B1 = \u03b3A2B2 \u2261 \u03b30 and it leads to the in-plane velocity\nv = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b30\/h\u00af where a is the lattice constant. We also take into account the strongest inter-layer\ncoupling, \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31, between pairs of A2-B1 orbitals that lie directly below and above each other.\nSuch strong coupling produces dimers from these pairs of A2-B1 orbitals, leading to the formation of\nhigh energy bands [7]. In addition, weaker A1-B2 coupling \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 is included, leading to an\neffective velocity v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/h\u00af where v3 \u226a v. We write the Hamiltonian [7] near the centers of the\nvalleys in a basis corresponding to wave functions \u03a8 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1) in the valley K [21] and of\n\u03a8 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2) in the valley K\u02dc:\nH = \u03be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212 12\u2206 v3\u03c0 0 v\u03c0\u2020\nv3\u03c0\n\u2020 1\n2\u2206 v\u03c0 0\n0 v\u03c0\u2020 12\u2206 \u03be\u03b31\nv\u03c0 0 \u03be\u03b31 \u2212 12\u2206\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (1)\nwhere \u03c0 = px + ipy , \u03c0\u2020 = px \u2212 ipy , p = (px, py) \u2261 p(cos\u03c6, sin\u03c6) is the momentum measured with\nrespect to the K point, \u03be = +1(\u22121) labels valley K (K\u02dc). The Hamiltonian takes into account asymmetry\n\u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 between on-site energies in the two layers, \u01eb2 = 12\u2206, \u01eb1 = \u2212 12\u2206.\nAt zero magnetic field, the HamiltonianH has four valley-degenerate bands [7], \u01eb(\u03b1)\u00b1 (p), \u03b1 = 1, 2, with\n\u01eb\n(\u03b1)2\n\u00b1 =\n\u03b321\n2\n+\n\u22062\n4\n+\n(\nv2 +\nv23\n2\n)\np2 + (\u22121)\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u0393\n\u0393 = 14\n(\n\u03b321 \u2212 v23p2\n)2\n+ v2p2\n[\n\u03b321 +\u2206\n2 + v23p\n2\n]\n+ 2\u03be\u03b31v3v\n2p3 cos 3\u03c6. (2)\nThey are plotted in Fig. 1(b) for \u2206 = 0 (dashed lines) and \u2206 = \u03b31 (solid) where, for simplicity, we neglect\nv3. The dispersion \u01eb(2)\u00b1 describes two bands with energies \u01eb\n(2)\n+ \u2265 \u03b31 and \u01eb(2)\u2212 \u2264 \u03b31: they do not touch at\nthe K point. These bands are the result of strong interlayer coupling \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31 which forms \u2018dimers\u2019\nfrom pairs of A2-B1 orbitals that lie directly below and above each other [7].\nThe dispersion \u01eb(1)\u00b1 (p) describes low energy bands that touch at the K point in the absence of layer\nasymmetry \u2206 = 0. In the intermediate energy range, 14\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2, |\u2206| < |\u01eb1| < \u03b31, it can be approximated\n[7] with \u01eb(1)\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1 12\u03b31[\n\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2\/\u03b321 \u2212 1]. This interpolates between a linear spectrum |\u01eb(1)\u00b1 | \u2248 vp at\nhigh momenta and a quadratic spectrum |\u01eb(1)\u00b1 | \u2248 p2\/2m, where m = \u03b31\/2v2.

KGaA, Weinheim\npss header will be provided by the publisher 3\n3 Effective low-energy Hamiltonian The transport properties of bilayer graphene are conveniently\ndescribed by a low-energy Hamiltonian that describes effective hopping between the non-dimer sites, A1-\nB2, i.e. those that do not lie directly below or above each other and are not strongly coupled by \u03b31. This\ntwo component Hamiltonian was derived in [7] using Green\u2019s functions. Alternatively (and equivalently),\none can view the eigenvalue equation of the four component Hamiltonian Eq. (1) as producing four simul-\ntaneous equations for components \u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1. Eliminating the dimer state components \u03c8A2,\n\u03c8B1 by substitution, and treating \u03b31 as a large energy, gives the two component Hamiltonian [7] describing\neffective hopping between the A1-B2 sites:\nH\u02c62 = \u2212 1\n2m\n(\n0\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\n)2\n\u03c02 0\n)\n+ h\u02c6w + h\u02c6a; (3)\nh\u02c6w = \u03bev3\n(\n0 \u03c0\n\u03c0\u2020 0\n)\n, where \u03c0 = px + ipy;\nh\u02c6a = \u2212\u03be\u2206\n[\n1\n2\n(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n\u2212 v\n2\n\u03b321\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\u03c0 0\n0 \u2212\u03c0\u03c0\u2020\n)]\n.\nThe effective Hamiltonian H\u02c62 is applicable within the energy range |\u01eb| < 14\u03b31. In the valleyK, \u03be = +1, we\ndetermine \u03a8\u03be=+1 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2), whereas in the valley K\u02dc, \u03be = \u22121, the order of components is reversed,\n\u03a8\u03be=\u22121 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1). The Hamiltonian H\u02c62 describes two possible ways of A1 \u21c0\u21bd B2 hopping. The first\nterm takes into account A1 \u21c0\u21bd B2 hopping via the A2B1 dimer state. Consider A1 to B2 hopping as\nillustrated with the thick solid line in Fig. 1(a). It includes three hops between sites: an intralayer hop from\nA1 to B1, followed by an interlayer transition via the dimer state B1A2, followed by an intralayer hop\nfrom A2 to B2. Since the two intralayer hops are both A to B, the first term in the Hamiltonian contains\n\u03c02 or (\u03c0\u2020)2 on the off-diagonal with the mass m = \u03b31\/2v2 reflecting the energetic cost \u03b31 of a transition\nvia the dimer state. This term in H\u02c62 yields a parabolic spectrum \u01eb = \u00b1p2\/2m with m = \u03b31\/2v2. It has\nbeen noticed [7] that quasiparticles described by it are chiral: their plane wave states are eigenstates of an\noperator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = \u22121 for electrons in the conduction band and \u03c3n2 = 1 for the valence band,\nwhere n2(p) = (cos 2\u03c6, sin 2\u03c6) for p = (p cos\u03c6, p sin\u03c6). Quasiparticles described by this term acquire\na Berry phase 2\u03c0 upon an adiabatic propagation along a closed orbit, thus charge carriers in a bilayer are\nBerry phase 2\u03c0 quasiparticles, in contrast to Berry phase \u03c0 particles in a monolayer [5].\nThe second term h\u02c6w in the Hamiltonian Eq. (3) describes weak direct A1B2 coupling, \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 \u226a\n\u03b31. This coupling \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 leads to the effective velocity v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/h\u00af where v3 \u226a v, Eq. (2).\nIn a similar way to bulk graphite [19, 22], the effect of coupling \u03b33 is to produce trigonal warping of the\nisoenergetic lines around each valley. At very low energies |\u01eb| < \u01ebL = 14\u03b31(v3\/v)2 \u2248 1meV, the effect\nof trigonal warping is dramatic. It leads to a Lifshitz transition: the isoenergetic line is broken into four\npockets, which can be referred to as one \u201ccentral\u201d and three \u201cleg\u201d parts [22, 7]. For v3 \u226a v, we find\n[7, 20] that the separation of the 2D Fermi line into four pockets would take place for very small carrier\ndensities n < nL \u223c (v3\/v)2 n\u2217 \u223c 1 \u00d7 1011cm\u22122. For n < nL, the central part of the Fermi surface is\napproximately circular with area Ac \u2248 \u03c0\u01eb2\/(h\u00afv3)2, and each leg part is elliptical with area A\u2113 \u2248 13Ac.\nThe overlap between the conduction and valence bands is given by 2\u01ebL \u2248 (\u03b31\/2)(v3\/v)2 \u2248 2meV [12]\nusing \u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV and v3\/v \u2248 0.1. Note that, at energies below the Lifshitz transition, the bilayer spectrum\nin each of the four Fermi surface pockets is linear, and the integral Berry phase 2\u03c0 in bilayer graphene [7, 8]\nis divided into Berry phase \u03c0 in each of the three side pockets and \u2212\u03c0 in the central one.\n4 Voltage-controlled gap in the spectrum of bilayer graphene The parameter \u2206 takes into account\na possibly-externally-controlled asymmetry \u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 between on-site energies in the two layers, \u01eb2 =\n1\n2\u2206, \u01eb1 = \u2212 12\u2206.

In an asymmetric\nbilayer, the electronic densities on the individual layers, n1 and n2, are given by an integral with respect to\nmomentum p = h\u00af |k| over the circularly symmetric Fermi surface, taking into account the relative weight\nof the wave functions: n1(2) = (2\/\u03c0h\u00af2)\n\u222b\np dp(\n\u2223\u2223\u03c8A1(2)(p)\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223\u03c8B1(2)(p)\u2223\u22232), where we have included a\nfactor of four to take into account spin and valley degeneracy. By determining the wavefunction amplitudes\non the four separate atomic sites we find\nn1(2) =\n\u222b\ndp p\n(\n\u01eb\u2213\u2206\/2\n\u03c0h\u00af2\u01eb\n)[(\n\u01eb2 \u2212\u22062\/4)2 \u2213 2v2p2\u01eb\u2206\u2212 v4p4\n(\u01eb2 \u2212\u22062\/4)2 + v2p2\u22062 \u2212 v4p4\n]\n, (4)\nwhere the minus (plus) sign is for the first (second) layer.\nIn the following we use a self-consistent Hartree approximation to determine the electronic distribution\non the bilayer and the resulting band structure in the presence of an external gate. We consider the graphene\nbilayer, with interlayer separation c0, to be located a distance d from a parallel metallic gate. The appli-\ncation of an external gate voltage Vg = end\/\u03b5\u2032r\u03b50 induces a total excess electronic density n = n1 + n2\non the bilayer system where n1 (n2) is the excess density on the layer closest to (furthest from) the gate\n(we use SI units). Here \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5\u2032r is the dielectric constant of the material be-\ntween the gate and the bilayer, and e is the electronic charge. We assume that the screening of the effective\ncharge density \u03c1+ = en from the metallic gate is not perfect, leading to an excess electronic density n2\non the layer furthest from the gate. The excess density n2 gives rise to an electric field with magnitude\nE = en2\/\u03b5r\u03b50 between the layers where \u03b5r is the nominal dielectric constant of the bilayer. There is a\ncorresponding change in potential energy \u2206U = e2n2c0\/\u03b5r\u03b50 that determines the layer asymmetry [13]:\n\u2206(n) = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 \u2261 e\n2n2c0\n\u03b5r\u03b50\n. (5)\nIn terms of the capacitance of a bilayer of area L2, Cb = \u03b5r\u03b50L2\/c0, this may be written \u2206(n) =\ne2n2L\n2\/Cb.\nWe self consistently calculate the excess densities n1, n2, n = n1+n2, Eq. (4), and the gap \u2206, Eq. (5).\nThis has been done numerically in Ref. [13].

The limit \u039b\u2192 0 describes poor screening when\nthe density on each layer is equal to n\/2 whereas for \u039b \u2192 \u221e there is excellent screening, the density\nlies solely on the layer closest to the external gate and \u2206 = 0. Note that f\u039b(x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0 because\nof the logarithm, meaning that the effectiveness of interlayer screening increases upon lowering density.\nUsing typical experimental parameters [20] we find \u039b \u2248 1.3. We estimate that the addition of density\nn \u223c 1012cm\u22122 yields a gap \u2206 \u223c 10meV [24].\nc\u00a9 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Inter-layer asymmetry creates a gap between the conduction and va-\nlence bands so that bilayer graphene is a semiconductor with a tuneable gap of up to about 0.4eV. A self-\nconsistent Hartree approximation was used to determine the density distribution of the two layers when the\ndensity n is varied using an asymmetrically placed gate, resulting in a density dependent gap \u2206(n). Con-\ntrol of the gap has been modelled taking into account screening within the tight binding model [13, 14, 17].\nIt seems that such calculations produce good agreement with ARPES experiments [9], measurements made\nin the regime of the quantum Hall effect [14], and density functional theory calculations [17]. The use of\na single gate modulates the density and the gap simultaneously, but it should be possible to control them\nindependently by employing both a top and a bottom gate. This suggests a route to nanoelectronic devices\ndefined within a single sheet of gated bilayer graphene.\nAcknowledgements The author thanks D.S.L. Abergel, V.I. Fal\u2019ko, A.K. Geim, K.

For huge values of the asymmetry |\u2206| \u226b \u03b31, the gap would saturate\nat \u2206\u02dc \u2248 \u03b31 although for modest asymmetry values |\u2206| \u226a \u03b31, the relation is simply \u2206\u02dc \u2248 |\u2206|.\n[24] In Section 4 we neglected the role of additional weak couplings, such as A1-B2 coupling \u03b33 that results in\ntrigonal warping, Section 3, and is relevant at low density n \u223c 1 \u00d7 1011cm\u22122. Indeed, trigonal warping should\nresult in a small overlap between the conduction and valence band of \u2248 2meV.\nc\u00a9 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n"}
