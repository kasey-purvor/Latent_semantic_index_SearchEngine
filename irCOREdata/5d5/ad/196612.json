T. cruzi has a variety of molecules that modulate several\neffector arms of the immune system [2], calreticulin (TcCRT)\nbeing one of them [3]. TcCRT, first isolated in our laboratory\n[4,5], is highly homologous with human calreticulin (HuCRT) [6],\nan exceedingly pleiotropic chaperone molecule [7]. In spite of its\nprimary endoplasmic reticulum (ER) location, TcCRT is also\nexpressed on the cell membrane [3].\nBased on their capacity to bind laminin [8] and to inhibit\nendothelial cell proliferation, both HuCRT and its N-terminal\nfragment, vasostatin or N-TcCRT, display antiangiogenic prop-\nerties in vitro and in vivo [9,10]. These HuCRT properties are\nparalleled by inhibitory activities on several tumor models [11\u2013\n13]. Identifying these properties in TcCRT may define important\naspects of the host\/parasite interaction.\nWe have recently reported that TcCRT is strongly antiangio-\ngenic in the chorioallantoid membrane in chicken eggs (CAM\nassay) [14]. Since angiogenesis modulators behave differently\nacross species [15], we verified this effect in different experimental\nset ups in mammals, Homo sapiens sapiens included. Thus, TcCRT\nand its vasostatin-like domain, inhibit angiogenesis in the ex vivo rat\naortic ring assay. It also affects key cellular angiogenic parameters\nin human endothelial cell cultures, such as proliferation,\nchemotaxis and cell morphogenesis into tubular-like structures in\nMatrigel. These results correlate with TcCRT binding and\ninternalization in these cells. Perhaps, the TcCRT antiangiogenic\n(and anti-complement) properties result in anti inflammatory\nwww.plosntds.org 1 July 2010 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e730\noutcomes, thus inhibiting the host antiparasite immune response.\nAlso, at least a partial explanation for those reports [16,17]\nproposing anti-tumor effects for trypanosome infection is herein\nprovided. Although anti-tumor effects have been reported for\nseveral decades now, for a variety of infections with other\nmicrobial agents [18,19], pathogen molecules mediating those\nstatistically based tumor resistances, have been poorly defined. In\nsynthesis, here we describe that a parasite chaperone molecule,\nmost likely by interacting with endothelial cells, and inhibiting\nangiogenesis, interferes with tumor growth.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were\nisolated [20], following informed patient\u2019s written consent\n(University of Chile Hospital Bioethics Committee).\nCells\nThe human endothelial EAhy926 cell line (kindly provided by\nDr. Gareth Owen, Pontifical Catholic University, Chile), was\nmaintained in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium (IMDM,\nInvitrogen, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen,\nUSA) and 100 units\/ml penicillin\/streptomycin (Sigma, USA).\nHUVECs were 80% pure by flow cytometry and immunofluores-\ncence using anti CD31 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma, USA) as a\nmarker. The cells were cultured in M199 medium (Sigma, USA),\nwith 20% FBS, 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen, USA), 100 units\/ml\npenicillin\/streptomycin, 100 mg\/ml endothelial cell growth sup-\nplement (ECGS) (BD Biosciences, USA), and 10 mg\/ml heparin\n(Sigma, USA) in gelatin-coated flasks.\nRecombinant proteins\nTcCRT, its R-domain (R-TcCRT) and HuCRT were obtained\nfrom E. coli [3,21]. N-TcCRT (amino acids 20\u2013193, GenBank\naccession no. AF162779) was amplified by PCR using Tli DNA\npolymerase (Promega, USA). Primers were: (59-GGAATTC-\nCACGGTGTACTTCCACGAG-39) and (59- CTCGAGCCAG-\nTCTTCTTCGAGCTG-39).\nN-TcCRT DNA was ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of\nthe pET-28b (+) plasmid (Novagen, UK). Competent E. coli\nTOP10F9 bacteria were transformed, plated and selected with\n50 mg\/ml ampicillin. E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS was transformed\nwith the plasmid and grown in the presence of 34 mg\/ml\nchloramphenicol with 50 mg\/ml kanamycin. After adding isopro-\npyl b-D-thiogalactoside and 3 h incubation, the cells were\nsonicated, centrifuged, and the supernatants filtered. The\nrecombinant proteins were purified using His Bind resin (Nova-\ngen, UK), eluted with buffer containing 1 M imidazole, and\ndialyzed against 2 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.\nBoth, TcCRT and N-TcCRT were tested for endotoxin by the\nLimulus Amebocyte Lysate Kinetic-QCL assay (BioWhittaker,\nUSA) and contained ,5 EU\/10 mg protein.\nThe R-TcCRT domain (aa 136\u2013281) was expressed and\npurified as previously described [3].\nRat aortic ring assay\nThis ex vivo angiogenesis assay [22], was performed with slight\nmodifications. Six week old Sprague-Dawley rats, from our\nAnimal Facility were used in this experiment. Briefly, the animals\nwere sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, their thoracic aortas dissected\nand sliced into 1 mm thick rings. Two or three rings per well were\nplaced on a 24-well plate and embedded in 100 ml Matrigel (BD\nBiosciences, USA), followed by 30 min incubation. Wells were\noverlaid with 300 ml of FBS-supplemented M199 medium with\n100 mg\/ml ECGS and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or several\nTcCRT concentrations. The rings were incubated for 7 days and\nvisualized under phase contrast in a Nikon Eclipse E400\nmicroscope. Fields were photographed and the length of capillaries\nmeasured using Adobe Photoshop software. For each experiment\nand in sextuplicate, 3 capillaries (shortest, medium and longest) per\nring were measured. The average length was considered as 100%.\nThe statistical validation of these experiments was defined by the\nStudent\u2019s t-test.\nMatrigel morphogenesis assay\n24-microwell plates were filled with 300 ml Matrigel\/well and\npolymerized for 1 h at 37uC. 706103 HUVECs\/well were\nsuspended in FBS-supplemented M199 medium, with 100 mg\/\nml ECGS and several TcCRT, N-TcCRT, lypopolisaccharide\n(LPS), HuCRT or R-TcCRT concentrations. The cells were\nlayered on the gel. After 6 h incubation, morphogenesis was\nassessed by phase contrast microscopy and images were imported\ninto the Adobe Photoshop program. Tubular capillary-like\nstructures were quantified by manual counting in 406 fields, in\nquadruplicates, as previously described [23]. Data were analyzed\nby one way ANOVA. Values are reported as means 6 SEM.\nComparison of means was performed by the Bonferroni method.\nChemotaxis assay\nWith HUVECs, the assays were performed in Boyden\nchambers, while Transwell chambers (Costar, USA) were used\nwith EAhy926 cells [24]. HUVECs were pretreated for 24 h with\nPBS, LPS, or variable TcCRT concentrations in FBS-supple-\nmented M199 medium. EAhy926 cells were pretreated with\nIMDM containing several TcCRT concentrations. 7.56104\nHUVECs or 56104 EAhy926 cells\/chamber were washed,\nresuspended in serum-free medium, and placed in the upper\ncompartment, with or without TcCRT or LPS.

Vertebrate calreticulins (CRTs) are multifunctional,\nintra- and extracellular calcium binding, chaperone pro-\nteins. Since human CRT (HuCRT) inhibits capillary growth\n(angiogenesis) and suppresses tumor growth, the pres-\nence of these functions in T. cruzi CRT (TcCRT) may have\ninteresting consequences in the host\/parasite interactions.\nPreviously, we have cloned and expressed TcCRT and\nshown that, when translocated from the endoplasmic\nreticulum to the area of trypomastigote flagellum emer-\ngence, it promotes infectivity, inactivates the complement\nsystem, an innate defense arm and inhibits angiogenesis in\nthe chorioallantoid chicken egg membrane. TcCRT inhibits\nangiogenesis, since it interferes with endothelial cell\nmultiplication, migration and capillary morphogenesis in\nvitro, as well as angiogenesis in rat aortic rings. The\nparasite molecule also displays important antitumor\neffects. In these activities, TcCRT is more effective than\nthe human counterpart. Perhaps, by virtue of its capacity\nto inhibit angiogenesis, TcCRT is anti-inflammatory, thus\nimpairing the antiparasite immune response. The TcCRT\nantiangiogenic effect could also explain, at least partially,\nthe in vivo antitumor effects reported herein and the\nreports proposing antitumor properties for T. cruzi\ninfection.\nTcCRT in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth\nwww.plosntds.org 2 July 2010 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e730\nused as chemo attractants in the lower chamber. After 6 h\n(HUVECs) or 16 h (EAhy926) incubation, the cells on the upper\nfilter surface were removed, and those on the lower surface, fixed\nand stained. Filters were photographed with CCD optics and a\ndigital analysis system (Image ProPlus, Media Cybernetics, Silver\nSpring, MD) and nine fields per filter were counted (HUVECs).\nEAhy926 cell migration was measured by densitometry analysis at\n595 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Data were\nanalyzed by one way ANOVA. Values are reported as means 6\nSEM. Comparison of means was performed by the Bonferroni\nmethod.\nProliferation assays\nThese assays were quantified using MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthia-\nzol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide, Calbiochem, USA) or\ncrystal violet reagents. Briefly, in the MTT assay, 2,500\nHUVECs\/well were seeded in sestuplicate in 96-well plate and\ngrowth, in the presence of various TcCRT, N-TcCRT or HuCRT\nconcentrations, was assessed at 24-h periods over 4 days. Then,\nMTT was added, incubated for 4.5 h, solubilized in DMSO and\nthe absorbance was read at 550 nm. The same assay was\nperformed with 2,000 VERO cells, as a negative control showing\nthat recombinant TcCRT did not affect the in vitro growth of an\nunrelated cell line. Data were analyzed by one way ANOVA,\nfollowed by the Bonferroni test. Values are reported as means 6\nSEM. In the crystal violet assay, the same number of HUVECs\nwere seeded in gelatin-coated wells and treated with R-TcCRT at\ndifferent concentrations. The number of viable cells was measured\nover time with the crystal violet reagent, following standard\nprocedures.\nProtein binding and internalization assays\nTcCRT was labeled with the FluoReporter FITC Protein\nLabeling Kit (Molecular Probes, USA). HUVECs or EAhy926\ncells were incubated with 1 mM TcCRT, FITC-TcCRT or FITC-\nTcCRT plus 10 mM unlabelled TcCRT, for 1 h. After washing,\nthe cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, for 15 min at\nroom temperature, washed and mounted in 50% glycerol,\ncontaining 49-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were\nvisualized in a Nikon Eclipse E400 epifluorescence microscope.\nProtein uptake was detected by incubating the cells for 30 min, in\nmedium containing 1 mM FITC-TcCRT, alone or in the presence\nof 25 mg\/ml fucoidin (Sigma, USA). Images were collected using\nthe LSM510 Software system attached to a Zeiss (Oberkochen,\nGermany) LSM510meta confocal microscope.\nTumor growth assay\nThe TcCRT and HuCRT effects on in vivo growth of the TA3\nMTXR murine mammary tumor cell line was assessed in 2\nindependent experiments, performed 6 months apart, in adult\nfemale A\/J mice. Four animals were used in the first experiment\nand 6 in the second one. In both experiments, the animals were\ninoculated s.c., every other day, with 50 mg TcCRT or HuCRT or\nsolvent, during 25 days. At day 0, the animals were challenged\nwith 56105 tumor cells. Tumor size was determined with a digital\ncaliper (Mitutoyo Corp, Japan), in a double blind procedure, as\npreviously described [25]. The experiments were validated by\nusing the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test (GraphPad Prism 4). P\nvalues#0.05 were considered as statistically significant.\nAnimal welfare\nSix week old New Zealand rats and adult (20\u201325 g) female A\/J\nmice were obtained from our Central Animal Facility. Experi-\nments were performed in compliance with the \u2018\u2018Guide for the Care\nand Use of Laboratory Animals\u2019\u2019, National Research Council,\nWashington DC, USA, 2002. All procedures with these animals\nwere approved by the local Bioethics Committee (Bioethics\nCommittee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile). Surgeries\nand sacrifices were performed by the Animal Facility Veterinary\nSurgeons.\nResults\nTcCRT inhibits angiogenesis in the rat aortic ring assay\nTwo representative experiments are shown in Figure 1, A\u2013B.\nMicro vessels are observed after culturing the aortic rings for 1\nweek (Figure 1A, control). Incubation with 1 mM TcCRT\nmediated complete capillary growth abrogation (Figure 1A,\nTcCRT). A dose-dependent antiangiogenic effect is observed\n(Figure 1B), until reaching complete capillary growth arrest. In\nFigure 1C, quantification of this TcCRT inhibitory capacity is\nshown. At concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mM, about 50% and\n100% inhibition is respectively observed. In separate experiments,\nthe vasostatin like N-TcCRT also inhibits angiogenesis in this ex\nvivo experimental model (data not shown).\nTcCRT and its N-TcCRT inhibit endothelial cell capillary\nmorphogenesis\nA set of representative experiments is shown in Figure 2. In a 5-\nhour culture, control non-treated HUVECs generated a typical\ncell network (Figure 2A). Although strong inhibitory effects were\nobserved with 1 mM HuCRT (Figure 2B), when N-TcCRT\n(Figure 2C) and TcCRT (Figure 2D) were compared at equal\nmolarities with HuCRT, the effects of the parasite\u2013derived\nmolecules were clearly stronger than those of the human\ncounterpart. Figure 2E shows the quantification of these assays.\nThe TcCRT inhibitory effect was dose-dependent down to\n0.1 mM (data not shown), while R-TcCRT did not affect capillary\nmorphogenesis (Figure 2F\u2013H).\nTcCRT inhibits endothelial cell migration\nHUVECs migration, as a response to the strong angiogenic\nfactors present in NIH\/3T3 cell conditioned media, was inhibited\nin a dose-dependent manner by TcCRT. LPS, at concentrations\nsimilar to those present in the TcCRT 1 mM preparation, showed\nno detectable effects (Figure 3A). Treatment with TcCRT also\nsignificantly inhibited migration of Eahy926 cells in response to\nFBS, over the same dose range (Figure 3B).\nTcCRT and N-TcCRT inhibit HUVEC proliferation\nFigure 4 summarize these experiments. TcCRT inhibited\nendothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, when\nthey were stimulated with ECGS (Figure 4A). Maximum\ninhibition (60%) was observed with 1 mM TcCRT, at 96 hours\n(Figure 4B). A similar activity was also observed when TcCRT or\nN-TcCRT were added to HUVECs stimulated with basic\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Figure 4C). R-TcCRT, up to\n1 mM, had no significant effects on HUVECs proliferation\n(Figure 4D). TcCRT did not affect VERO cell proliferation\n(Figure 4E), used as negative control.\nTcCRT binds to human endothelial cells and is\ninternalized\nAlthough both HuCRT [8] and TcCRT bind to laminin, only\nthe former interferes with the adhesion of endothelial cells to this\nmolecule (data not shown). Therefore, the TcCRT antiangiogenic\nTcCRT in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth\nwww.plosntds.org 3 July 2010 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e730\neffect may be explained by other mechanisms, such as direct\ninteraction with endothelial cells. FITC-TcCRT binds to live\nHUVECs (Figure 5C). This binding is reversed by a molar excess\nof the unlabeled protein (Figure 5D). Given the similarity between\nthe DAPI and FITC-TcCRT mediated signals in this experiment\n(Figure 5C, merge), confocal microscopy was used to test if\nTcCRT was internalized after binding to the cell surface. After\n30 min incubation, TcCRT accumulates around the HUVECs\nnuclei, in punctuate structures (Figure 5E), a phenomenon also\nobserved in EAhy926 endothelial cells (data not shown).

TcCRT internalization seems to be\nreceptor-dependent, since fucoidin, a specific scavenger receptor\nligand [26,27], abrogated TcCRT uptake (Figure 5F).\nTcCRT inhibits the growth of a murine mammary tumor\nThe TcCRT and HuCRT effects on the in vivo growth of the\nTA3 MTXR murine A\/J mammary tumor cell line was assessed\nin adult mice, in two independent experiments, performed 6\nmonths apart (Figure 6A\u2013B). Under the experimental conditions\nused, only the parasite chaperone molecule displayed significant\n(p = 0.0078) inhibitory effects on this tumor cell line, in both cases\n(Figure 6A\u2013B). In one experiment (Figure 6A), TcCRT displayed a\nstronger antitumor effect, than the human orthologue (p= 0.0078\nvs p= 0.1094). In the second experiment, HuCRT also had an\neffect (Figure 6B, p = 0.0078). However, again TcCRT had a\nstronger antitumor effect than HuCRT (p= 0.0078) (Figure 6B).\nDiscussion\nWe have shown that TcCRT strongly inhibits capillary growth\nin the CAM in vivo assay [14]. Since angiogenesis modulators\nbehave differently, not only across species, but also depending on\nthe assay used [15], we studied the TcCRT antiangiogenic\nproperties in the rat, a natural T. cruzi host. The ex vivo rat aortic\nring assay provides a model closer to the physiologic in vivo\nsituation, since endothelial cells are in a quiescent state, in a\nnatural histological environment. In this assay, TcCRT completely\nabrogates capillary growth, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1).\nCapillary morphogenesis in Matrigel is a valid in vitro correlate of in\nvivo angiogenesis. As shown in Figure 2, when TcCRT, N-TcCRT\nand HuCRT were compared in their capacities to inhibit\nmorphogenesis, only the parasite-derived molecules significantly\ninterfered with this process. The relevant TcCRT aminoacid\nsequence spans residues 20\u2013191, corresponding to N-TcCRT. R-\nTcCRT did not affect capillary morphogenesis, in spite of its\noverlapping with N-TcCRT in aminoacids 136\u2013191.\nChemotaxis is an essential step in capillary morphogenesis and\nangiogenesis. In HUVECs and Eahy926 cells, migration was\ninhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TcCRT (Figure 3). Cell\nmigration inhibition by TcCRT may explain (at least partly) its\npotent effects on in vitro capillary morphogenesis and ex vivo\ncapillary formation. These results agree with those describing the\nHuCRT capacity to increase cell binding to extracellular matrix,\nwith consequent cell migration inhibition [28,29].\nAs shown in Figure 4, TcCRT and N-TcCRT share the\nHuCRT capacity to specifically inhibit endothelial cell prolifera-\ntion, a key initial event in angiogenesis [10]. These effects were not\nobserved in a different cell line, like fibroblasts, used as negative\ncontrols. In HuCRT, the smallest anti-proliferative fragment spans\naa 120\u2013180 [10]. Since, as observed in the morphogenesis assay,\nR-TcCRT had no significant effect on HUVECs proliferation,\nrelevant residues also map between aa 20\u2013135. TcCRT interferes\nwith pro angiogenic bFGF (Figure 4C), by unknown mechanisms.\nHuCRT also inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells from\ndiverse origins, such as FBHE [10], BAECs [30], HUVECs [31]\nand ECV304 [32], in response to bFGF and VEGF. R-TcCRT\ndid not affect HUVECs proliferation (Figure 4D), nor morpho-\ngenesis (Figure 2F\u2013H).\nHUVECs proliferation inhibition by TcCRT may imply its\ninvolvement in the cell cycle or, alternatively, in cell death\ninduction. TcCRT added at different concentrations to 24, 72 and\n96 h HUVECs cultures did not induce apoptosis. Therefore, in\nthe TcCRT-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, a cytostatic\neffect, rather than apoptosis induction, may be mediated by the\nparasite molecule.\nRecombinant proteins from E. coli, are normally contaminated\nwith LPS, an antiangiogenic molecule [33]. In all the experiments\ndiscussed above, LPS was ineffective at concentrations equivalent\nto those present in the recombinant TcCRT preparations.\nAlthough both HuCRT and TcCRT bind laminin, only the\nformer interferes with endothelial cell adhesion and, as a\nconsequence, with angiogenesis. Thus, the antiangiogenic TcCRT\neffects could be explained by other mechanisms, such as direct\nTcCRT interaction with endothelial cells. Alternatively, TcCRT\nFigure 3.

We now show that TcCRT binds to endothelial\ncells, followed by internalization. The transduction pathways\ninvolved are unknown. SREC-I (scavenger receptor expressed by\nendothelial cell-I) could be involved in these phenomena. HuCRT\nbinds SREC-I, is endocytosed, and delivers associated peptides for\ncross presentation via MHC- I [34], [27], a fact compatible with\nour observations on the fucoidin (a specific SREC-I ligand [26,27])\ncapacity to inhibit TcCRT internalization by HUVECs\n(Figure 5E). Besides being an endocytic receptor, SREC-I is an\ninteresting candidate for signal transduction. Its intracellular\ndomain comprises almost half of the molecule, surprisingly large\namong known scavenger receptors. It also contains several\npotential phosphorylation consensus sites [35,36]. These results\nare compatible with the possibility that TcCRT internalization is a\nrequisite to mediate its antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cells.\nWhether TcCRT interferes with the endothelial cell cytoskeleton,\nis unknown.\nPerhaps, the parasite ability to inhibit angiogenesis interferes\nwith immune\/inflammatory responses against this aggressor. On\nFigure 5. TcCRT binds to live HUVECs and is internalized. HUVECs were incubated with: A. FITC or 1 mM: B. TcCRT, C. TcCRT-FITC, D. TcCRT-\nFITC + 10 mM TcCRT, E. TcCRT-FITC and F.

The induction of specific immune anti-\ntumoral responses [39] and\/or the secretion of \u2018\u2018toxic substances\u2019\u2019\nby the parasite [16,40] were invoked to explain these effects, but\nno experimental evidences have been provided. Maybe, TcCRT,\nby interacting with endothelial cells and preventing neoangiogen-\nesis, interferes in tumor growth and metastasis. For these reasons\nwe tested the TcCRT and Hu-CRT capacity to inhibit in vivo the\ngrowth of a murine mammary tumor (TA3 MTXR). Only\nTcCRT displayed significant anti-tumor effects in both experi-\nments. Moreover, the parasite molecule displayed stronger effects\nthan HuCRT. Although maximum efforts were made to perform\nthe experiments under similar conditions, the tumor growth was\ndifferent by about 2-fold, in the experiments shown in Figure 6 A\u2013\nB. The cell line is maintained in our laboratories, as ascites tumor\nin A\/J mice, with weekly passages and the experiments were\nperformed six months apart. Thus, although the conclusions\ndrawn from both experiments are basically the same, we cannot\nrule out minor variations in handling, site of inoculation or in the\ncell line itself that could explain the different overall tumor growth\nobserved in both experiments.\nWhile the prevalence of tumor aggressions in wild and domestic\nT. cruzi hosts has not been assessed, in humans they may reach\nalmost epidemic dimensions (i.e. mammary, prostate, ovary and\ncervix-uterine cancers, taken altogether). Thus, the TcCRT\ncapacity to delay tumor growth, together with its anti inflamma-\ntory properties (derived from its complement inhibition capacity),\nmay represent an evolutionary parasite adaptation, with final\nincreased infectivity.\nIn synthesis, in this report we show that T. cruzi calreticulin has\npotent antiangiogenic activities, both on rat arterial (aortic ring\nassay) and human venous (HUVECs) endothelial cells. These\nproperties map to the N-TcCRT domain in the parasite molecule.\nTcCRT plays key in vitro antiangiogenic roles, expressed as\ninhibition of capillary morphogenesis, proliferation and migration\nof endothelial cells. TcCRT internalization by endothelial cells is\nperhaps necessary in the antiangiogenic process. These facts,\ntogether with those previously reported by us, showing that\nTcCRT is a potent in vivo inhibitor of angiogenesis in a third\nvertebrate species (CAM assay), allow us to propose that the\nTcCRT antiangiogenic effects may be implicated in inflammatory\nand antineoplastic effects, with benefits for the parasite in its\ninteractions with the vertebrate host. These findings may open\ninteresting possibilities for the development of new antineoplastic\nstrategies, especially if we consider that the parasite molecule\ndisplays stronger antiangiogenic and anti-tumor effects than its\nhuman counterpart. Biotechnological implications of these find-\nings may be envisaged. Whether the antiangiogenic properties\nwere consolidated, first in the parasite chaperone molecule, and\nHuCRT conserved some of these properties, as an evolutionary\nrelict or, alternatively, the parasite hijacked this activity from its\nvertebrate host, remains an open question.\nSupporting Information\nAlternative Language Abstract S1 Translation of the abstract\ninto Spanish by Arturo Ferreira\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pntd.0000730.s001 (0.02 MB\nDOC)\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: NCL AA AF.

TcCRT inhibits the development of a murine A\/J mammary tumor (TA3 MTXR). Two in vivo experiments, performed six months\napart, are shown (A\u2013B). 56105 tumor cells were inoculated s.c. in the 10 A\/J female mice used in both experiments. TcCRT and HuCRT treatments, as\nwell as measurement of tumor development, are described in the Methods section. TcCRT showed an anti-tumor effect in both experiments\n(p = 0.0078) and these effects were stronger (p = 0.0078) than those promoted by HuCRT.
