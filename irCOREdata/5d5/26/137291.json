The CB schemes have been implemented in\nconjunction with a multigrid method for accelerating numerical conver-\ngence and a fourth-order, explicit Runge-Kutta method for the integration\nof the governing equations in time. The implementation of the CB schemes\nis obtained in conjunction with first, second and third-order interpolation\nformulas for calculating the variables at the cell faces of the computational\nvolume. The accuracy and efficiency of the schemes are examined against\nanalytical and experimental results for diffusion broadening in two- and\nthree-dimensional microfluidic channels, a problem that has motivated\nthe development of the present methods. Moreover, unsteady, inviscid\nsimulations have been performed for variable density mixing layer. The\ncomputations revealed that accuracy and efficiency depend on the CB\nscheme design. The best multigrid convergence rates were exhibited by\nthe conservative CB scheme, which is obtained by the fully conservative\nformulation of the variable-density, incompressible equations.\n2\n1 Introduction\nEven though there are a number of studies that have been concerned with the\ndevelopment of pressure projection methods for variable density flows [1, 2], the\ndevelopment of numerical methods for these flows in the framework of artificial\ncompressibility has received scant attention in the literature. In [3], three nu-\nmerical formulations for the governing equations for variable-density flows, all\nbased on the artificial compressibly approach [4], were presented. On the basis\nof these formulations, characteristics-based schemes were derived along similar\nlines as for compressible [5] and constant-density incompressible flows [6, 7].\nThe variants of CB schemes derived in [3], labeled as transport, conservative\nand hybrid, differed with respect to the formulation of the transport equation\nfor total density and the use of divergence-free condition. The transport CB\nscheme reconstructs numerically species and total densities along the stream-\nlines, while in the conservative CB scheme pseudo-compressibility terms are\nadded into the reconstruction formulas for the density. Finally, the hybrid CB\nscheme reconstructs the densities along the streamlines, similar to the transport\nCB scheme, while the eigenvalues of the system of equations are the same with\nthe eigenvalues of the conservative CB scheme.\nIn this paper we present the numerical implementation of the artificial compress-\nibility CB schemes in conjunction with multigrid techniques. Implementation\nof different variants of multigrid methods in conjunction with the artificial com-\npressibility approach have been presented in the literature for computations\nof laminar flows [8, 9], free surface flows (based on Euler simulations) [11],\nturbulent flows [12, 13], incompressible low-Mach number flows [14], as well\n3\nas using adaptive grids [9] and adaptive solvers [15]. Pertinent to the multi-\ngrid implementation for AC are also research works on multigrid methods for\nthe preconditioned Euler\/Navier-Stokes equations for low-Mach number, steady\nand unsteady flows [16, 17, 18, 19]. The combination of multigrid methods and\nartificial compressibility in the context of different variable density formulations\nhas not been previously discussed in the literature, thus motivating a detailed\nnumerical investigation. Therefore, numerical tests have been performed for\nthree flow problems: (i) diffusion broadening in a two-dimensional microfluidic\nchannel; (ii) diffusion broadening in a three-dimensional microfluidic channel;\nand (iii) time-dependent evolution of variable density mixing layer.\nMicrofluidics have been a research subject of increasing interest in the past few\nyears, mainly because of the wide range of practical applications. Two-fluid lam-\ninar flow at low Reynolds numbers are extensively used in chemical separation,\nextraction and detection [20, 21, 22, 23] as well as in microreactors [24], mi-\ncromixing devices [25] and biotechnology [26]. An extensive review of microflu-\nidic devices applications in biotechnology and organic chemistry can be found in\n[29]. Another important application of microfluidics is in microfabrication [28],\nwhere liquid interfaces are created by laminar flow in microfluidic channels. In\nall the above applications, the characteristic microchannel dimensions are of\norder 102\u00b5m which is still in the domain of continuum mechanics simulations\n[27]. The Reynolds numbers occuring in these applications range from Re\u00bf 1\n(flow sensors, heat sink channels, capillary tubes [35]), Re \u223c 10\u22121 \u2212 102 (e.g.,\nin diffusion broadening [31] and micromixers [34]) to Re > 103 (microvalves,\nmicronozzles\/pumps [35]).\nWhen two miscible species are supplied via separated inlets into a channel\n4\nwith rectangular cross section they will result in the development of a diffu-\nsion front (see Fig. 1). This problem has been studied experimentally, analyti-\ncally and numerically by a number of researchers. Ismagilov et al [30] analyzed\nthe advection-diffusion equations for a fully developed three-dimensional flow\nand indicated that the diffusion front position power-law dependency on the\nstreamwise direction (i.e., along the channel) varies from 0.5 in the middle of\nthe channel to 1\/3 near the channel wall. These results were found to be in\nagreement with both experimental data [30, 31] as well as numerical solutions\n[31]. The latter were obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes equations for the\nflow field, which in turn is used to compute advection-diffusion equations for\nspecies transfer (decoupled solution). Other modeling approaches for diffusion\nbroadening include decoupled two and three-dimensional solutions of advection-\ndiffusion equations, simplifying the problem for the part of the channel that does\nnot depend on the streamwise direction [32, 33].\nIn this paper the diffusion broadening problem has been employed at constant\nPeclet numbers and densities ratios and at different Reynolds numbers, in or-\nder to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the artificial-compressibility CB\nschemes. This includes investigation of the multigrid efficiency as well as dif-\nferent variations of intercell variable interpolation. Furthermore, an assessment\nof the accuracy and efficiency of the present methods has been carried out\nfor variable-density temporal mixing-layer flow, which is initiated by a hyper-\nbolic tangent velocity profile (see Fig. 2). This problem has been extensively\nstudied for single fluid cases, including linear stability analysis [36], and has\nbecome an established test bed for comparison of different numerical schemes\n[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. A temporal (reacting) shear layer and the effect of non-\n5\nuniform density on its development have been studied by Ghoniem et al [43, 44].\nThe effect of non-uniform liquid entrainment resulting in displacement of the\nvortex-center towards the lighter fluid has been observed in our computations\nand this is in accord with previous studies [44, 46, 47].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a summary of the three variable-\ndensity formulations and CB schemes used in this investigation is presented.\nSection 3 discusses the multigrid implementation of the artificial-compressibility\nCB schemes. Section 4 presents numerical results for the 2-D and 3-D diffusion\nbroadening problems, while Section 5 presents results for the temporal variable-\ndensity mixing layer. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main conclusions drawn\nfrom the present research.\n2 Numerical formulation\nOur numerical model comprises of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,\nthe species transport equations for species densities and the artificial compress-\nibility approach for coupling the continuity and momentum equations. The\nartificial-compressibility for steady flow problems adds a pseudo-time pressure\nderivative to the continuity equation [4]. For unsteady problems pseudo-time\nvelocity derivatives need to be added to the momentum equations and for vari-\nable density problems pseudo-time density derivatives also need to be added\nto the densities transport equations. The pseudo-time velocity and densities\nderivatives are required for coupling and solving the governing equations in\npseudo-time, \u03c4 . Based on the above, the nondimensional system of equations is\nwritten as\n6\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u2202~u\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2212\u2202~u\n\u2202t\n\u2212\n(\n(~u \u00b7 \u2207) ~u+ 1\n\u03c1\n\u2207p\u2212 1\nRel\n\u22072~u\n)\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2212\u03b2\u2207 \u00b7 ~u\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2212\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t\n\u2212 (~u \u00b7 \u2207) \u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1i\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2212\u2202\u03c1i\n\u2202t\n\u2212\n(\n(~u \u00b7 \u2207) \u03c1i \u2212 1\nPe\n\u2207 \u00b7\n(\nl=N\u22121\u2211\nl=1\nDli\u03c1\u2207\u03c1l\n\u03c1\n)) (1)\nAt each real time step, t, the solution of the system (1) is obtained by iterating\nin pseudo-time, \u03c4 , until convergence is achieved within a prescribed convergence\ntolerance; thus the incompressibility (divergence free) condition is satisfied at\neach time step. The parameters and variables in the above equations are defined\nas follows: \u03b2 is the artificial compressibility parameter; ~u is the velocity vector\nwith components (u, v, w) for the three Cartesian directions (x, y, z), respec-\ntively; \u03c1 is the fluid density; p is the pressure; and Rel = UoL\/\u03bdl denotes the\nReynolds number, where Uo and L denote reference values for the velocity and\nspatial dimension, respectively, while \u03bdl is the local kinematic viscosity.

The variables\nwith indices L and R denote left and right states of intercell values, which\nare calculated by polynomial interpolation, first, second or third-order accurate\n[3]. Finally, we mention that the solution in pseudo-time is advanced by a\nfourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme [50] in conjunction with a nonlinear multigrid\n10\nmethod that is presented in the next section.\n3 Multigrid acceleration\nMany of the basic concepts introduced in multigrid methods for elliptic equa-\ntions [10] are also applicable to the present discussion, but the specific details\nare different due to the fundamental nature of the equations. In the present\ncase, the multigrid method is applied to solve the coupled system of equations\n(1). In principle, multigrid can be implemented in conjunction with several grid\nlevels, i.e., five, six or even more, and this is often the case when multigrid\nis employed to solve elliptic equations such as the pressure-Poisson equation.\nThere are, however, numerical reasons on the basis of which one can argue in\nfavor of a smaller number of grid levels, e.g., 3 grid levels. If the grid on which\nthe equations are to be solved is not fine enough, then the coarsest grid will not\nencompass a sufficient number of grid points to provide a good correction for the\nfine grid. Numerical experiments have shown that in the case of (very) coarse\ngrids the multigrid efficiency is significantly reduced. This has been observed\nin theoretical investigations of multilevel algorithms for non-symmetric (e.g.,\n[51, 52]) and nonlinear problems (e.g., [53]). A smaller number of grids also\nimproves the efficiency of parallel computations, as has been demonstrated in\nprevious studies by \u00c5lund et al. [55] and Axelsson and Neytcheva [56, 57]. Fi-\nnally, the use of several grid levels may increase the complexity of the computer\ncode and memory requirements.\nFor the case of steady flows, the solution of the equations can be obtained by a\nfull multigrid \u0015 full approximation storage algorithm (FMG-FAS) on a sequence\n11\nof coarser grids and this solution can be used as an initial guess for the multigrid\nprocedure. The coarse grid computations provide a good initial guess for the\nintermediate grid and the same procedure is repeated on the intermediate grid\nin order to provide a good initial guess for the finest grid. The main steps of\nthe V-cycle implementation of the three-grid algorithm (fine, intermediate and\ncoarse grids) are described below using the following notation (see also Fig. 3):\nP and R stand for the prolongation and restriction operators; Ncg and Nfg\ndenote the Navier-Stokes solution on the coarse and fine grids, respectively;\n0cg is the initial condition used for the solution; V\u00af stands for the coarse grid\nfunction. The solution algorithm utilized for single grid calculations is also used\nas a relaxation procedure (S) on the fine (Sfg) and intermediate grids (Sig),\nand as a solver on the coarse grid. The various steps of the three-grid solution\nare listed below:\n\u2022 Perform \u03bd1 pre-smoothing iterations on the fine grid, symbolically written\nas Ufg := Sfg(Ufg, 0fg, \u03bd1).\n\u2022 Compute finest grid defect, dfg := NfgUfg\n\u2022 Restriction of the defect to the intermediate grid dig := R dfg .\n\u2022 Compute the right hand side \u0015 RHS in (2) \u0015 of the Navier-Stokes equations\non the intermediate grid, fig := \u2212dig + NigV\u00afig. The term V\u00afig is defined\naccording to Brandt [58] (see discussion below).\n\u2022 Perform \u03bd1 pre-smoothing iterations on the intermediate grid,\nVig := Sig(Vig, fig, \u03bd1)\n\u2022 Compute intermediate grid defect, dig := \u2212fig +NigVig.\n12\n\u2022 Restriction of the defect to the coarse grid, dcg := R dig .\n\u2022 Compute the right hand side of the equations on the coarse grid, fcg :=\n\u2212dcg + NcgV\u00afcg. The term V\u00afcg is defined according to Brandt [58] (see\ndiscussion below).\n\u2022 Compute coarse grid approximate solution, Vcg := N\u22121cg fcg.\n\u2022 Compute correction on the coarse grid, ccg := Vcg \u2212 V\u00afcg.\n\u2022 Prolongation of the correction to the intermediate grid, cig := P ccg.\n\u2022 Correct solution on the intermediate grid, Vig := Vig + cig.\n\u2022 Perform \u03bd2 post-smoothing iterations on the intermediate grid,\nVig := Sig(Vig, fig, \u03bd2).\n\u2022 Compute correction on the intermediate grid, cig := Vig \u2212 V\u00afig.\n\u2022 Prolongation of the correction to the finest grid, cfg := P cig.\n\u2022 Correct solution on the finest grid, Ufg := Ufg + cfg\n\u2022 Perform \u03bd2 post-smoothing iterations on the finest grid,\nUfg := Sfg(Ufg, 0fg, \u03bd2).\nThe pre-smoothing, post-smoothing and coarsest grid iterations are performed\nby a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme to march the solution in pseudo-time.\nNote that the Navier-Stokes solver used on the coarse and intermediate grids\nis slightly different than the original single-grid solver because the RHS of the\nNavier\u0015Stokes equations becomes zero (upon achieving convergence) only for\nthe single-grid algorithm. In the case of the multigrid method the right-hand-\nside of the equations in the coarse and intermediate grids is not zero due to the\n13\nadditional terms (e.g., NigVig) arising from the FAS linearization procedure. For\nunsteady flows the multigrid V-cycles are performed at each time step (Fig. 4).\nLarger time steps can be used on the coarse and intermediate grids to further\nreduce the number of iterations on these grid levels.\nIn the case of linear equations the multigrid solution on the fine grid can be\ndirectly computed on coarser grids using the same solution matrix and with\nthe restricted defect being the RHS of the equations. However, this will not\nlead to efficient solutions in the case of nonlinear problems. In this case the\nmultigrid corrections are formed as differences between some basic reference\nsolution and the currently computed approximation of this solution. Therefore,\nthe three-grid FAS algorithm requires the calculation of the so-called coarse-\ngrid functions. In the case of the three-grid algorithm these functions need to\nbe defined for the coarse, V\u00afcg, and intermediate grids, V\u00afig, respectively. Here, we\nfollow the strategy suggested by Brandt [58] that is to calculate these functions\nas projections of the current intermediate and finest grid solutions onto the\ncoarse and intermediate grids, respectively: V\u00afcg = R Vig , V\u00afig = R Ufg , where\nR is the restriction operator.\nThe efficiency of the multigrid solution depends on the relaxation steps at dif-\nferent grid levels, i.e., pre- (\u03bd1) and post-relaxation (\u03bd2) iterations, as well as\niterations on the coarse grid (\u03bdcg). We have performed several numerical exper-\niments, which have shown that for the `unsteady-type' multigrid employed here,\nthe equations do not have to fully converge on the coarsest grid for achieving the\nbest multigrid efficiency. Moreover, numerical experiments have indicated that\nalthough the number of pre- and post-relaxation iterations depends on the flow\ncase, six to twelve iterations are sufficient. In order to comparatively examine\n14\nthe efficiency of different CB schemes in variable density flow computations, we\nhave used fixed multigrid cycle parameters for all test cases, comprising of 10\npre-smoothing and post-relaxation iterations on the fine grid; no pre-smoothing\nand 10 post-relaxation iterations on the intermediate grids; and 1500 iterations\non the coarsest grid; computations on each grid level are performed until either\nthe maximum number of iterations is reached or the solution is converged.\nThe implementation of multigrid requires restriction and prolongation operators\nto be defined. The restriction operator can be simply defined by considering\nthat any coarse-grid control volume (CV) consists of eight fine grid CVs (in\nthree dimensions). In simple geometries, this can be achieved by covering the\ncomputational domain with a coarse grid and further refine it in such a way\nthat any coarse-grid volume is split into eight fine-grid volumes. For complex\ngeometries it is better to first generate the finest grid, and then construct the\ncoarser grids by eliminating lines of the fine grid. Then, the restriction operator\nis defined by the weighted summation of all the values over the fine-grid CVs.\nMultigrid algorithms can be implemented using different prolongation operators.\nThe simplest definition of the prolongation operator is the linear interpolation\n(Fig. 5). If Uf and U c are the values of the variable U on the fine and coarse\ngrids, respectively, and assuming that in one dimension the fine-grid cells with\nindices (2i\u22121) and (2i) will form a coarse-grid cell (i), then the fine-grid values\nare obtained by the coarse-grid ones as follows\nUf2i =\n1\n4\nU ci+1 +\n3\n4\nU ci , U\nf\n2i+1 =\n3\n4\nU ci+1 +\n1\n4\nU ci . (10)\nFor two- and three-dimensional cases, bilinear or trilinear prolongation formulas\n15\ncan be obtained by combining one-dimensional linear interpolation. If (2i, 2j, 2k)\nare the indices of the fine-grid cell in three dimensions, the trilinear prolongation\noperator is then defined by\nUf2i,2j,2k =\n1\n64\nU ci+1,j+1,k+1 +\n3\n64\nU ci+1,j+1,k +\n3\n64\nU ci+1,j,k+1 +\n3\n64\nU ci,j+1,k+1 +\n9\n64\nU ci+1,j,k +\n9\n64\nU ci,j+1,k +\n9\n64\nU ci,j,k+1 +\n27\n64\nU ci,j,k . (11)\n4 Diffusion broadening studies\nThe diffusion broadening problem (Figure 1) provides a test bed for investigat-\ning the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical methods discussed here. The\nflow setup comprises of two miscible fluids of different densities entering a chan-\nnel of rectangular cross section through two rectangular inlets and flowing in a\nmicrofluidic slit. Ismagilov et al. [30] derived analytic solutions for the depen-\ndence of the diffusion front position on the distance from the inlets and found\nthat the position of the diffusion front is proportional to x 12 in the middle of\nthe channel and to x 13 near the wall. These results were found to be in good\nagreement with experiments [30, 31], approximate models [32, 33] and solutions\nof the diffusion equations based on `frozen' flow conditions [31], i.e., solving only\nthe advection-diffusion equations for species transport for a prescribed flow field.\nIn our numerical investigation we have considered both 2-D and 3-D flows at\nlow Reynolds numbers typical for microfluidic applications, Re \u2208 [25, 100], and\nfor a fixed value of Peclet number Pe = 103. Density variations are typically\n16\nsmall in diffusion broadening problems, where usually both streams contain a\ndilute solution of diffusing species. In the present study and in order to assess\nthe ability of the numerical schemes to accurately capture the contact discon-\ntinuity, the dimensionless densities of the two fluids were chosen to be 1.0 and\n0.8, respectively. Moreover, we considered both fluids having the same viscos-\nity in order to reduce the number of parameters involved in the investigation.\nThe velocity boundary condition at the inlets is given by a parabolic profile\nnormalized by the maximum inlet velocity. At the outlet the velocities are ob-\ntained by extrapolation considering that the channel is long enough to allow\nfully developed flow to be established. The pressure is considered constant and\nequal to 1 (dimensionless) at the outlet, while it is obtained by linear extrapo-\nlation in the boundary cells at the inlet. The densities of the fluids are constant\nat the inlets, with each inlet occupied by one fluid. As an initial condition,\nwe have employed parabolic velocity profiles and constant pressure equal to 1\neverywhere. Initially, the heavier fluid occupies one inlet and the channel down-\nstream, while the second inlet is occupied by the lighter fluid. For the present\nproblem and Reynolds number, the no-slip boundary condition on the wall is\nstill valid. The computational grid has been clustered near the entrance of the\nmain section. In the 2-D computations, the fine grid contained 37 \u00d7 37 and\n197 \u00d7 73 grid points in the inlets and main sections, respectively. In the 3-D\ncomputations, the fine grid contained 17\u00d7 17\u00d7 17 and 57\u00d7 33\u00d7 17 grid points\nin the inlets and main sections, respectively. Fig. 6a shows the grid used in\nthe 2-D computations near the entrance to the main section; the coordinates\nwere non-dimensionalized using the inlet height as a characteristic length. The\nCFL numbers used for defining the time steps (the pseudo-time step depends\n17\non the CFL number for stability reasons) for the 2-D and 3-D computations\nwere 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. Computations have been carried out both for\n2-D and 3-D cases with channel lengths 27 and 40 inlet heights for the 3-D and\n2-D cases, respectively, and inlet length of one inlet height in both cases. The\ndevelopment of the flow field for the 2-D case in the entrance section is shown\nin Fig. 6b by means of u-velocity contours. The results in this figure have\nbeen obtained for Re = 50 using the conservative CB scheme with third order\npolynomial interpolation.2 The slight asymmetry of the streamlines in Fig. 6b\nis due to the fact that the flow is not yet fully developed. For the 2-D case, an\nexact analytic solution is available for the velocity of the fully developed flow in\nthe main section of the channel [42]; this is a parabolic profile since the fluids\nhold the same viscosities. The development of the velocity profile as computed\nusing the conservative CB scheme is shown in Fig. 7a, while Fig. 7b shows the\ncomparison between analytic and computed solutions. Analytic estimates [30]\nindicate that the diffusion profile for a 2-D case is governed by a power law with\nexponent 0.5. In our investigation, for a 2-D case we have defined the diffusion\nfront position as the point where species density falls below 20% of its density at\nthe inlet (the position of diffusion front inside a grid cell was obtained by linear\ninterpolation). Fig. 8 shows the development of diffusion fronts, in logarithmic\nscale, as obtained by different CB schemes (transport, conservative and hybrid)\nand different orders of polynomial interpolation. As expected, the results show\nthat the power-law dependency is established only in the region along the chan-\nnel where the velocity profile is fully developed. For the 2-D case (Fig. 8), a\ndeviation of 5% for the u-velocity value at the center line of the main channel\n2The Reynolds number calculation is based on the maximum inlet velocity, viscosity of the\nfluids at the inlet and inlet height.\n18\nfrom its value when the flow becomes fully developed flow, was reached at the\ndistance of 3.5 inlet heights. The deviations of the computationally obtained\nslopes from the analytic value of 0.5 are summarized in Table 1. The accuracy\nof the solution increases with the order of interpolation. The discrepancies be-\ntween different CB schemes are below 0.16% and further decrease as we increase\nthe order of polynomial interpolation.\nFigure 9 shows cross section density profiles in the main channel. These pro-\nfiles provide information about how accurately the contact discontinuity has\nbeen resolved. The best results were obtained by third-order interpolation. The\nresolution of discontinuity exhibited no significant dependence on the variables\nreconstruction method, with the results varying slightly for the first-order in-\nterpolation but becoming identical for all CB schemes when using third-order\ninterpolation. All the CB schemes investigated here are nominally second-order\naccurate. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the the computational results depends\non the polynomial interpolation as shown by the calculation of the diffusion\nslopes in Table 1. To numerically examine the order of accuracy obtained by\ndifferent polynomial interpolations, we have carried out grid convergence studies\nusing three uniform grids containing 28 \u00d7 24, 56 \u00d7 48 and 112 \u00d7 96 computa-\ntional cells in the main channel section, respectively. We have used the average\nof the absolute value of the u-velocity throughout the computational domain,\nuav, in order to analyze the grid convergence for all the CB schemes and orders\nof polynomial interpolation. The grid convergence, ngr, can be estimated as\nngr =\nln\n\u2223\u2223(ucoarseav \u2212 umediumav )\/(ufineav \u2212 umediumav )\u2223\u2223\nln 2\n, (12)\n19\nwhere ucoarseav , umediumav and ufineav are the average velocity values obtained on\nthe coarse, medium and fine grids, respectively. The results of Table 3 show that\nsecond-order of accuracy (approximately) is obtained by the transport, hybrid\nand conservative CB reconstructions, where the small discrepancies between\nsecond and third-order polynomial interpolations are within the error margin of\nthe convergence rate estimation.\nTo examine the convergence behavior of different schemes variants we have\nused as convergence criterion the maximum of the solution variation within a\npseudo-time step (complete Runge-Kutta cycle) normalized by the maximum\nvariation obtained in the first step of the pseudo-time iteration; this criterion\nis henceforth labeled as Runge-Kutta residual. The solution was considered\nto be converged when the initial Runge-Kutta residual had been reduced by\nthree-order of magnitudes, which corresponds to actual magnitude of solution\ndifference of the order 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126.\nFigure 10 shows the Runge-Kutta residual norms for 2-D computations at\nRe = 50 for the three variants of the CB schemes using first-order (Figure\n10a), second-order (Figure 10b) and third-order polynomial interpolations (Fig-\nure 10c). The conservative CB scheme consistently exhibits faster convergence\nrates. The actual number of multigrid cycles required to reach convergence is\nsummarized in Table 2, where the values in brackets give the percentage reduc-\ntion in the number of multigrid cycles compared to the transport CB scheme\n(slowest convergence).\nIn addition to the 2-D numerical studies, 3-D computations were also performed.\nThe diffusion front and u-velocity development for the 3-D case are shown in\nFigure 11. The diffusion front position was defined as the point where species\n20\ndensity falls below 20% of its density at the inlet. Figure 12 shows the position of\nthe diffusion front (in log scale) calculated on the channel's wall and centerline at\nRe = 50, for the three CB schemes, conservative (Figure 12a), hybrid (Figure\n12b) and transport schemes (Figure 12c). The experimental diffusion front\nslopes correspond to the ones obtained in [30, 31]. The results shown in Fig. 12\nwere obtained using third-order polynomial interpolation. Note that the power-\nlaw dependency as obtained by analytic estimations [30] is not applicable in the\nentrance region, where the flow is not yet fully developed.\nFigure 13 shows the dependency of the diffusion fronts on the order of poly-\nnomial interpolation for conservative (Figure 13a), hybrid (Figure 13b) and\ntransport schemes (Figure 13c) of CB schemes. The deviation of the calculated\nslopes from the experimental values in the channel's centerline and on the chan-\nnel's wall are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The conservative\nscheme in conjunction with second\/third order interpolations provides overall\nthe best results. This is shown with respect to the calculation in the channel's\ncenterline. The results on the wall exhibit a slightly different tendency with the\ntransport and hybrid CB schemes, first-order interpolation based, to provide\nthe best accuracy; noting, however, that the discrepancies of the conservative,\nCB scheme against the experimental results is also very small.\nThe efficiency of the computations in terms of multigrid convergence was found\nto be dependent on the CB scheme employed. Figure 14 shows the Runge-Kutta\nresidual norms for all CB schemes (3-D computations at Re = 50) for first (Fig-\nure 14a), second (Figure 14b) and third-order polynomial interpolation (Figure\n14c), respectively, in logarithmic scale.The conservative CB scheme provided\nthe best (fastest) multigrid convergence regardless of the polynomial interpola-\n21\ntion used. The transport CB scheme resulted in the slowest convergence. The\nnumber of multigrid cycles required to reach convergence is also summarized\nin Table 6, where the values in brackets give the percentage reduction of the\nnumber of multigrid cycles compared to the transport CB scheme (slowest case).\nFinally, numerical tests were performed to examine the convergence behavior\nat different Reynolds numbers. In Figure 15 results are presented for different\nReynolds numbers and orders of polynomial interpolation in conjunction with\nthe conservative CB scheme. Further, in Table 7 the convergence results, in\nterms of total multigrid cycles, are given for the three CB schemes. The re-\nsults show that: (i) the numerical convergence is improved at higher Reynolds\nnumbers for all CB schemes, and (ii) the conservative CB scheme yields better\nconvergence for all Reynolds numbers (see Table 7).\n5 Variable density mixing layer\nComputations have also been performed for a 2-D, inviscid, variable-density,\ntemporally-developed, mixing layer in order to gain insight into the dissipative\nproperties of the characteristics-based schemes as well as multigrid efficiency in\ncombination with different polynomial interpolations. The setup of the prob-\nlem comprises of a variable-density mixing layer defined by hyperbolic tangent\nvelocity and density profiles (Figure 2)\n{\n\u03c1 = 2 + tanh (y)\nu = tanh (y) , (13)\nwhere the density ratio between the streams \u03c10\/\u03c11 = 3. Sinusoidal wave pertur-\n22\nbations are imposed to the profiles. The wave number, \u03b1, of the perturbations\ncorresponds to the most unstable mode for a single-fluid mixing layer with the\nsame velocity profile, i.e., \u03b1 = 0.4446 and wavelength \u03bb ' 14.13 [36]. The\namplitude of the perturbations is taken to be 1% of the wavelength. For the\npurpose of the numerical experiments the problem is considered to be inviscid\nand, therefore, diffusion cannot occur because both diffusion and viscosity have\nthe same molecular origin. In the absence of viscosity, diffusion can occur in\nthe case of a dilute solution or particles diffusion (see, e.g., [54]).\nThe dimensions of the computational domain correspond to two wavelengths\nof the initial perturbation, i.e., {(x, y) : x \u2208 [0, 2\u03bb] , y \u2208 [\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb]}. The computa-\ntional grid consists of 117 \u00d7 117 grid points. We have used periodic boundary\nconditions on the left and right boundaries and no-slip boundary conditions\non the upper and lower boundaries in the y direction. All unsteady computa-\ntions were performed with CFLp = 0.07 in pseudo-time and CFLr = 0.2 in\nreal time, where for the present problem the pseudo-time and real time steps\nare defined by \u2206\u03c4i,j,k = CFLp\/(maxm=1\u22126 {(|\u03bb1| , |\u03bb2|)}m)i,j,k and \u2206ti,j,k =\nCFLr\/(maxm=1\u22126 {(|\u03bb1| , |\u03bb2|)}m)i,j,k, respectively, where m stands for the six\nfaces of the computational cell in 3-D.\nThe evolution of the mixing layer is illustrated in Figure 16 by means of the\ndensity contours at different time instants. These results have been obtained\nby the conservative CB scheme and third-order polynomial interpolation. The\nresults show that the center of the vortex is displaced towards the lighter fluid\nas also predicted in previous studies [44, 46, 47]. Figure 17 shows the density\ncontours at dimensionless time t = 25 as obtained by using the conservative CB\nscheme in conjunction with first, second and third-order interpolation. The least\n23\ndissipative solution is obtained by third-order interpolation, while the first-order\ninterpolation gives very dissipative results. The discrepancies between second\nand third-order are not significant on the 117\u00d7 117 grid (Fig. 16), but become\ngreater as the grid is further coarsened. Figure 18 illustrates development of the\ndensity layer on a coarser grid (57 \u00d7 57), as obtained by the conservative CB\nscheme and third-order polynomial interpolation. Figure 19 compares the den-\nsity contours at dimensionless time t = 25 using the conservative CB scheme in\nconjunction with first, second and third-order interpolation on the coarse grid.\nIt can be seen that the third-order interpolation significantly reduces numerical\ndissipation. Figure 20 shows the development of the mixing layer thickness in\ntime as obtained by different CB schemes in conjunction with different orders\nof interpolation. The results exhibit slight differences when the CB schemes are\nused with first-order interpolation but overall the choice of the CB scheme has\nnegligible effects on the results. Furthermore, Figure 21 shows the mixing layer\nthickness dependency on the order of polynomial interpolation for conserva-\ntive, hybrid and and transport schemes. Both second- and third-order variants\nexhibit very similar results.\nThe convergence performance was investigated for different CB schemes and\ninterpolation variants. For unsteady flows, the norm of the variables derivatives\nin pseudo-time was employed as parameter to monitor convergence at each time\nstep. The solution was considered to converge when the maximum of all norms\nreached 10\u22124. For the artificial-compressibility-based methods considered in\nthis study, we have observed that the maximum number of multigrid cycles\nrequired to reach convergence occurs in the first time step. This is due to\nthe nature of the artificial-compressibility formulation, which cannot satisfy the\n24\ndivergence-free constraint per se, but instead requires this to be iteratively ob-\ntained. Therefore, we have used two criteria to compare multigrid convergence\nof different schemes: the first one is the number of multigrid cycles required to\nreach convergence at the first time step and the second one is the total number\nof multigrid cycles throughout the computation up to a prescribed time instant\n(t = 30, dimensionless, in the present numerical experiments). Figures 22 and\n23 show the reduction of the residual norm in pseudo-time (first real time step)\nfor the three CB variants in conjunction with first, second and third-order in-\nterpolation schemes. The hybrid and conservative schemes exhibit the same\nconvergence, whereas the transport variant results in slower convergence. The\nnumber of multigrid cycles required to reach convergence at the first time step\nis listed in Table 8 both for coarse and fine grid computations. Interestingly,\nsecond and third-order interpolation schemes require the same number of multi-\ngrid cycles on the fine grid. However, if we consider the multigrid cycles for the\nentire computation (see Table 9, results corresponding to t = 30), it is seen that\nthe third-order interpolation results in faster convergence speed compared to\nsecond-order. In Table 9, the values in brackets give the percentage reduction\nof the number of multigrid cycles compared to the transport scheme (slowest\nmethod). As expected, the difference between second and third-order interpo-\nlation schemes in terms of multigrid cycles is reduced when refining the grid.\nOverall, the results reveal that similar to the diffusion broadening studies the\nconservative CB scheme provides the best multigrid convergence.\n25\n6 Conclusions\nA numerical study for the accuracy and efficiency of artificial-compressibility CB\nschemes for variable density incompressible flows, was presented. The study\ninvolved three different CB schemes in conjunction with three intercell inter-\npolation variants and multigrid acceleration. The differences in the design of\nthe CB schemes arise from the origin of the variable-density formulation of the\ngoverning system of equations. Both steady and unsteady flow problems were\nemployed to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the schemes. The steady flows\ncases concerned 2-D and 3-D diffusion broadening flows through microfluidics\nand the unsteady flow concerned the temporal development of a variable-density\nmixing layer.\nThe results for all CB schemes were found to be in good agreement with an-\nalytical and experimental data with better results being obtained when using\nthe CB schemes in conjunction with second and third-order intercell interpo-\nlation. It was, however, shown that multigrid convergence depends on the CB\nvariant as well as on the polynomial interpolation used at the cell faces of the\ncomputational volume.\nThe (viscous) flow computations through microfluidics showed that the con-\nservative CB scheme exhibits better multigrid convergence compared to the\nhybrid and transport schemes, e.g., for 3-D computations the conservative CB\nscheme resulted in up to 39% reduction in multigrid cycles compared to the\ntransport CB scheme. This can be explained by the fact that the conservative\nformulation has a direct effect on the speed of density disturbances during the\npseudo-time iterations. The computations also revealed that the difference, in\n26\nterms of multigrid cycles required to achieve convergence, between hybrid and\nconservative schemes is smaller compared to that between hybrid and transport\nschemes. Both in transport and hybrid schemes, the densities are reconstructed\nalong streamlines and, essentially, the only difference between these two formu-\nlations is the absence of the velocity divergence condition from the momentum\nequations that are used in the CB reconstruction [3]. The inviscid mixing layer\ncomputations showed that the difference between hybrid and conservative CB\nschemes in terms of multigrid cycles is smaller in this case than in the diffusion\nbroadening computations. This indicates that the appearance of the pseudo-\ncompressibility term in the densities (reconstruction) formulas has a stronger\neffect on the multigrid convergence in the case of viscous problems.\nFurthermore, the numerical convergence is also dependent on the intercell in-\nterpolation. The computations showed that more multigrid cycles are required\nwhen increasing the order of intercell variable interpolation. Since reasonable\naccuracy for the diffusion broadening problem was obtained by all orders of\npolynomial interpolation, one may consider the tradeoff between convergence\nspeed and accuracy, especially when dealing with 3-D problems and fine grids.\nFor the diffusion broadening problem the best compromise seems to be achieved\nby second-order interpolation.\nFinally, in [3] we showed that in the limit of constant density incompressible\nflows the transport CB scheme corresponds to the original characteristics-based\nscheme for incompressible, constant density flows [7, 6], whereas the hybrid and\nconservative CB schemes lead to a new variant of the CB scheme for incom-\npressible, constant-density flows. The multigrid convergence tests performed in\nthis paper reveal that the conservative CB variant provides the best convergence\n27\namong the three schemes. This motivates further investigation of the behav-\nior of this scheme for constant density flows and research in this direction is\ncurrently in progress.\nAcknowledgments\nThe financial support from
