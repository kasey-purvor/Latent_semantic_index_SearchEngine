This paper focuses on the body\nof literature concerned with the factors which influence innovation management in\norganisations. The aim of this research is to present a holistic view of the factors that\neffect innovation management. Using a systematic literature review approach, using\nover 100 papers, this research identifies 9 key factors that impact on an organisations\nability to manage innovation. These 9 factors have been identified as management\nstyle and leadership, resources, organisational structure, corporate strategy,\ntechnology, knowledge management, employees and innovation process. The paper\nthen discusses the inductively derived model that presents the important relationships\nidentified between the factors to present a holistic view of innovation management.\nFrom this we open up the debate on innovation management as a systemic approach\nrather than being focused on the singular factors. We can therefore conclude that a\nnumber of dominant relationships exist between the factors with the innovation\nprocess being the only endogenous factor within the model.\n3Introduction\nInnovation has long been cited as essential for organisational competitiveness and\nsuccess (McAdam and Keogh, 2004; Edwards et al., 2005). This awareness of\ninnovation has generated a great deal of literature on the subject of innovation. As a\nresult innovation has become an extensive concept that can be perceived in a number\nof different ways. For the purpose of this research we used Tidd et al\u2019s (2001: 38)\ndefinition of innovation which is \u201cInnovation is a process of turning opportunity into\nnew ideas and of putting these into widely used practice\u201d. Damanpour (2001)\npresents a typology of innovation types, innovation can be radical, incremental,\nproduct, process, administrative or technical. By drawing these two definitions\ntogether innovation in the context of this research work can be thought of at its\nbroadest sense, considering various types of innovation.\nA wide body of literature has arisen that identifies the common factors shared by\ninnovative organisations and the factors that impact on the ability to manage\ninnovation. The general management literature often prescribes that organisations\nshould increase their organisational innovativeness to remain competitive (Porter,\n1990; Lengnick-Hall, 1992; Roberts, 1998), but the literature often neglects to address\nhow organisations can impact on their ability to manage innovation. Using this body\nof literature we conduct a structured literature review that identifies the organisational\nfactors that influence the ability to manage innovation at the firm level. Such a\nsystematic approach to the innovation literature is missing from the current body of\nliterature. By identifying and analysing the factors, we identify where relationships\nbetween the factors exist, this is achieved though identification of the relationships\nthat are commonly cited in the literature. This will enable academics and practitioners\nalike to understand what factors can be manipulated by organisations to increase their\nability to manage innovation. Although this paper does not provide a prescriptive\nmethod for organisations to follow to become innovative, it does identify what factors\nand relationships are important in impacting an organisations ability to manage\ninnovation.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the factors which\ninfluence an organisations ability to manage innovation. Often studies regarding\nsuccess factors for innovation considers these factors independent of each other (for\nexample, van der Panne et al., 2003), we argue in this paper that the factors are not\nindependent of each other and are in fact interrelated. We therefore put forward the\nproposition that innovation management needs to be considered in a holistic manner.\nMethodology\nThe fundamental research problem that faces any researcher working in the area of\ninnovation is the vastness of literature on the subject. The authors used a systematic\nliterature review technique as an effective means of coping with the number of papers\npublished in this area.\nAlthough systematic review theory was developed from medical research methods, it\nis gaining awareness in the management research field (Tranfield et al., 2003; Denyer\nand Neely, 2004; Pittaway et al., 2004). Traditional narrative literature reviews are\n4criticised for being heavily influenced by researcher bias (Mulrow, 1994; Denyer and\nNeely, 2004).\nSystematic reviews \u201cbring together as many studies as possible that are relevant to the\nresearch being undertaken, irrespective of their published location, or even\ndisciplinary background\u201d (Thorpe et al., 2004: 258). This must be done in a way that\nensures that all the decisions that are made during the review process are transparent;\nthis allows readers to determine the suitability of the studies included and the\nrobustness of the conclusions drawn (Denyer and Neely, 2004).\nThe literature search begins with keywords and search terms (Tranfield et al., 2003).\nFor this study, we selected the following keywords and strings: drivers AND\ninnovati*, barriers AND innovati*, organisatio* AND innovati*, \u201cfactors influencing\ninnovation\u201d, \u201cinnovative organisation\u201d, \u201cinnovativeness\u201d and \u201corganisational\ninnovativeness\u201d. These keywords were entered into prominent academic databases,\nincluding ABI Proquest, Emerald and Ingenta. The databases were searched for\ncitations from 1960 to present. This process resulted in the retrieval of 4,212 citations.\nUsing the same methodology as Thorpe et al. (2005) these citations were then\ndownloaded into bibliographic software, where the titles were analysed against pre-\ndefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although there are weaknesses with\nanalysing only the titles of studies other authors have found this approach useful when\ndealing with a massive amount of citations (Pittaway et al., 2004; Thorpe et al., 2005).\nIf there was ambiguity with a study\u2019s title, the citation abstract was reviewed to\nunderstand the relevance of the study. At this point, the citations were examined to\nidentify duplicate citations, book reviews and anonymous authors. After this initial\nreview and title analysis, 977 relevant citations remained in the database.\nCriteria to Select Sources\nThe abstracts of the selected 977 citations were analysed to understand their fit and\ncontribution to the purpose of this study. We defined a set of characteristics that a\npaper should present in order to maximise the quality of the systematic review, these\ninclusion criteria are seen in table 1.\nTable 1 - Inclusion Criteria\nCriteria Reasons for Inclusion\nAll industries and sectors To gain a wide picture of the factors that affect organisational\ninnovation and innovativeness \u2013 not just limited to one area.\nAll countries To ensure a cross-cultural view of organisational innovativeness.\nBarriers to innovation in\norganisations\nTo identify the factors that inhibits innovation in the organisational\ncontext.\nDrivers for innovation in\norganisations\nTo identify the factors that encourages innovation in the organisational\ncontext.\nCharacteristics of innovative\norganisations\nTo identify the characteristics that are evident in organisations that\nhave been recognised as innovative\nConducting a similar exercise, a set of exclusion criteria were identified (as seen in\ntable 2) these identify the characteristics which would make a paper worthless to this\nstudy.\n5Table 2 \u2013 Exclusion Criteria\nCriteria Reasons for Exclusion\nNational systems of\ninnovation\nThis is not in the organisational context.\nImplementation of specific\ninnovations\nThe results are focused on the innovation being implemented.\nConsumer innovativeness To exclude many articles that focus on how consumer innovativeness\naffects the product\/services they buy.\nAs a result of this stage, 102 studies were considered pertinent to this literature review\n(marked bold in the references). The full texts of the studies were then reviewed in-\ndepth to extract organisational factors that impact the ability to manage innovation.\nIdentifying the factors influencing an organisations ability to manage innovation\nThe 102 studies selected were analysed to identify factors affecting organisations\nability to manage innovation. From each article full text, the factors described were\nlocated in the text extracted as quotes into a database, e.g. \u201cshared vision\u201d from\nCalatone et al., (2002) and Garcia-Morales et al., (2006). This was repeated for the\n102 articles resulting in 423 database entries. Any exact duplicate quotes (factors)\nwere immediately eliminated, reducing the entries to 321. Additionally any factors\nthat were concerned with common themes were merged, e.g. \u201cLeadership\u201d and\n\u201cLeadership style\u201d were combined. This reduced the number of factors to 295.\nHowever, many of the factors in the database were related to one another, e.g.\n\u201cMarket knowledge\u201d and \u201cKnowledge integration\u201d. To be of use to study innovation\nthe factors needed further consolidation.\nTo rationalise the factors influencing an organisation\u2019s ability to manage innovation a\nstrategy was used that has been described in different ways by different authors. Jones\n(2004) uses \u2018Nominal Group\u2019 technique, i.e. a physical gathering where the\nparticipants use brain-storming techniques, and private ranking of ideas and tabulation\n(Mays and Pope, 2000).\nThis was repeated across all the 295 original factors in the database to create 31 sub-\nfactors shown in column 2 of Table 3. The process did not group beyond the point\nwhere further interpretation of authors\u2019 descriptions of factors would have been\nrequired. The second stage used the factor groupings cited by Damanpour (1991);\nRead (2000); Lemon and Sahota (2004); Webster (2004) to establish clusters of the 31\nsub-factors created. The clustering resulted in nine \u2018generic\u2019 factors being identified\nthat could collectively represent all the original factors from the database, these are\nshown in column 1 of Table 3. To maintain traceability of these nine factors to the\nfactors quoted from the full text articles the links to the 31 sub-factors and 295\noriginal factors were maintained. For example under the factor \u201cTechnology\u201d there\nare a number of sub-factors including \u201cUtilisation of technology\u201d. For brevity, a third\ncolumn in Table 3 that lists the links to the 295 original remaining factors has been\nomitted.\n6Table 3 \u2013 Factors and sub-factors influencing an organisations ability to manage\ninnovation\nFactor Sub-Factors\nTechnology Utilisation of technology\nTechnical skills and education\nTechnology strategy\nInnovation process Idea generation\nSelection and evaluation Techniques\nImplementation mechanism\nCorporate strategy Organisational strategy\nInnovation strategy\nVision and goals of the organisation\nStrategic decision making\nOrganisational structure Organisational differentiation\nCentralisation\nFormality\nOrganisational culture Communication\nCollaboration\nAttitude to risk\nAttitude to innovation\nEmployees Motivation to innovate\nEmployee skills and education\nEmployee personalities\nTraining\nResources Utilisation of slack resources\nPlanning and management of resources\nKnowledge resources\nTechnology resources\nFinancial resources\nKnowledge management Organisational learning\nKnowledge of external environment\nUtilisation of knowledge repositories\nManagement style and leadership Management personalities\nManagement style\nMotivation of employees\nIn pursuit of clarity we have described what each of the factors mean in the context of\nthis research as they can often have different meanings in different contexts.\nTechnology. Technology is often discussed as an output of innovation (Erdener and\nDunn, 1995; Madsen et al., 2005), but in this research we are concerned with its role\nas an influencing factor. Technology discussed in this paper is concerned with the\nutilisation of technology to facilitate innovation and innovative behaviour within and\nbetween organisations.\nInnovation process. Although a few authors (Cummings and O'Connel, 1978; Knight,\n1987; Amar, 2004; Galia and Legros, 2004; Bessant et al., 2005; Merx-Chermin and\nHijhof, 2005) discuss the impact of operational processes on organisational\n7innovativeness, in the context of this paper processes relate to the generation,\ndevelopment and implementation of innovations.\nCorporate Strategy. Strategy is a wide subject area and the definition can often be\nconfusing. Strategy in this research refers to aspects of the corporate and innovation\nstrategies of the organisation (Damanpour and Evan, 1984; Read, 2000; Martins and\nTerblanche, 2003) and how they impact on the management of innovation. It also\nrefers to the dissemination of the strategic vision throughout the organisation.\nOrganisational structure. Organisational structure has received much attention in the\ngeneral management literature (e.g. Mintzberg, 1992) and often covers more than the\nsimple configuration of the organisation. However, within this research\norganisational structure relates to the way the various parts of an organisation are\nconfigured and how this impacts on an organisations ability to manage innovation.\nOrganisational culture. Culture here refers to the culture of the organisation,\nalthough organisational culture has been discussed widely in general management\nliterature (e.g. Hofstede, 2001). In the context of this research it relates to the values\nand beliefs of the organisation and how these impact the ability to manage innovation\nwithin the organisation. It takes into consideration the organisation\u2019s approach to\ncollaboration, communication and risk.\nEmployees. Employees refers to the non-management employees of the organisation\nand the role they play in affecting innovation management. This factor takes into\naccount the various personal characteristics associated with employees (e.g. Ahmed,\n1998; Bharadwaj and Menon, 2000) and the motivation of employees to become\ninnovative (e.g. Mostafa, 2005).\nResources. Relates to all the resources that the organisation has, human, financial and\nphysical, but they are discussed in relation to the level of slack resources (e.g. Nohria\nand Gulati, 1996; Subramanian and Nilakanta, 1996) and how resources are managed\n(e.g. Knight, 1987; Wan et al., 2005) to impact on an organisations ability to manage\ninnovation.\nKnowledge management. Knowledge management in this research refers to the\nmanagement and utilisation of knowledge for innovation management. This covers\nall aspects of knowledge, both internal and external to the organisation. This factor\nwill also take organisational learning into consideration as it plays a key role in\nknowledge management (e.g. Salavou, 2004; Ng, 2004).\nManagement style and leadership. Management style and leadership refers to the\nemployees that have responsibility for the management of the organisation. This\nfactor is concerned with a number of aspects to the way management influences the\nmanagement of innovation. For example it takes into account the management style\nwithin the organisation (e.g. Pearson et al., 1989; Hyland and Beckett, 2005) and how\nmanagement can motivate employees to become more innovative (e.g. Roffe, 1999;\nRivas and Gobeli, 2005).\n8Table 3 synthesises the results and discussions of a large number of papers and puts\nthem into a common framework. The results of this stage of the research show that\nthere are 9 factors (and relating sub-factors) that influence an organisations ability to\nmanage innovation. Many authors have already performed this type of analysis of the\nliterature (Damanpour, 1991; Tidd et al., 2001; Bessant, 2003) but it has been limited\nin its scope.\nAlthough our findings do share some common factors with other studies we have\nprovided a more comprehensive view of the literature concerning the factors that\ninfluence innovation management. The work carried out in this research encompasses\ndifferent academic fields and organisational contexts and has drawn together the\nfindings from over 100 studies on innovation to develop the factors in table 3.\nThe value in this work is not in the identification of the factors but the examination of\nthe important relationships between the factors. This provides a more complete view\nof how these factors and relationships impact on innovation management. This\nresearch aims to open up the debate on innovation management as a systemic\napproach by organisations and not merely focused on singular factors.\nRelationship Model of Factors Influencing the Management of Innovation\nDevelopment of Model\nThrough the structured review process a number of relationships which exist between\nthe factors was captured. From this literature review we can identify the commonly\ncited relationships that exist between the factors identified, this is shown in Figure 1.\nThe relationships (and direction of the relationships) between the factors are denoted\nin the model by the arrows. The arrows, and therefore relationships, were identified\nafter the factors (as seen in table 3) had been inductively derived. Further review of\nthe 102 papers examined reference to relationships between any of the factors. While\nthe literature shows that all the factors had some level of relationship between them\nthere were some relationships that were more commonly discussed then others, it is\nthese commonly discussed relationships we have synthesised into an inductive model\nin this paper.\nIt is important to note at this point that organisational culture will require special\nattention in the paper as it is the most commonly cited factor in the literature for\nimpact an organisations ability to manage innovation. It was also seen to have the\nwidest impact on the other factors, organisational culture is pervasive therefore we see\nno benefit in explicitly linking it to the other factors in the model.\n9Figure 1. Relationships between the factors\nRole of organisational culture\nFor this research \u2018culture\u2019 relates to the values and beliefs of the organisation and how\nthese impact the management of innovation within the organisation. It takes into\nconsideration the organisation\u2019s approach to collaboration, communication and risk.\nOrganisational culture is often intrinsic to the way an organisation functions and the\nvalues it engenders within its operation. It is also the most commonly discussed\nfactor relating to an organisations ability to manage innovation identified within this\nstudy. Ahmed (1998) goes as far to say that it is the \u2018primary determinant\u2019 of\ninnovation. Due to the pervasive role that organisational culture plays in the\nmanagement of innovation this factor is discussed separately.\nThe relationship between culture and strategy is highly complex and it is often\ndifficult to separate the effects strategy and culture have on each other. The\nrelationship between these two factors is examined within the literature in two ways.\nFirstly, in the way the culture will drive the strategy adopted, for example some\nauthors (Veugelers and Cassiman, 1999; Craven et al., 2002) discuss the impact\nhaving a culture that encourages risk will have on developing strategies that have\nhigher levels of risk. Secondly, the literature discusses the impact corporate strategy\nhas on organisational culture. For example, some authors argue that by having a\nshared vision of innovation, the organisations strategic goals will translate into the\norganisation\u2019s culture (Vrakking, 1990; Calantone et al., 2002; Martins and\nTerblanche, 2003; Lemon and Sahota, 2004; Ng, 2004 Garcia-Morales et al., 2006).\nTherefore it can be seen that an organisation\u2019s strategy can represent the underlying\nculture that currently exists but corporate strategy can also drive the culture within the\norganisation. There is a delicate relationship between these two factors and strategic\nchange often requires a substantial change in organisational culture (Balogun et al.,\n2004).\nIt is often difficult to separate organisational culture and organisational structure as\nboth have developed in parallel over the lifetime of the organisation. While the\nliterature is in agreement on the nature of organisational culture for managing\n10\ninnovation it is more difficult to discuss the organisational structure conducive to\neffective management of innovation. Mintzberg (1979) describes the \u2018innovative\norganisation\u2019 in his seminal work but this is a simplistic view of organisational\nstructure for innovation management. Burns and Stalker (1961) on the other hand\nprovide a contingent approach that highlights the complexities of organisational\ncontext on the management of innovation, it is this approach that we adopt when\nconsidering the relationships within our model.\nManagement style, techniques and behaviour often reflect the culture of the\norganisation. A move away from an autocratic management style to a more\nparticipatory and democratic style of management reflects a culture that is focused on\nstimulating innovation (Pearson et al., 1989; Roffe, 1999; Rivas and Gobeli, 2005;\nHyland and Beckett, 2005). Some authors maintain that a change in management\nattitude and approach can actually engender a culture that encourages and supports\ninnovation (McDonough and Leifer, 1986; Knight, 1987; Pearson et al., 1989;\nDamanpour, 1991; Roffe, 1999; Read, 2000; Zwetsloot, 2001; Jaskyte, 2004; Hyland\nand Beckett, 2005; Mostafa, 2005; Rivas and Gobeli, 2005). Changes in management\ncharacteristics can impact on the ability of organisations to manage innovation but\nMcDonough and Leifer\u2019s (1986) view that management must retain a balance\nbetween an innovative culture and the maintenance of everyday operational\nrequirements is also important. This balanced view is often missing from the wider\ninnovation literature.\nThe notion of extended and networked enterprises has long been discussed in the\ngeneral management field, and a culture that supports collaboration means that\nnetworking can become a reality. Networking with other organisations, whether long-\nterm or short-term, can result in an organisation\u2019s attitude to innovation changing\n(Hadjimanolis, 2000; Kandampully, 2002; Pavitt, 2002; Flor and Oltra, 2004; Jaskyte\nand de Riobo, 2004; Medina et al., 2005; Mudrak et al., 2005). This is because the\norganisation becomes open to new ways of thinking and doing, and learns from the\nexperiences of other organisations or external bodies. One of the key ways that\norganisations can increase their external linkages is through their employees having\ncontact with external bodies such as universities and professional institutions. This\ninteraction with the external environment often results in increased levels of\nprofessionalism in the organisational culture. Professionalism is often discussed in\nrelation to the positive impact it has on an organisation\u2019s ability to manage innovation\n(Daft, 1978; Damanpour, 1987).\nThe willingness to learn and generate knowledge is something that needs to be\ninherent in the organisation\u2019s culture (Subramanian and Youndt, 2005). An\norganisational culture that actively seeks out new knowledge and learning\nopportunities has a culture that is descried as a \u2018learning orientation\u2019 (Glynn, 1996;\nBharadwaj and Menon, 2000; Calantone et al., 2002; Chanal, 2004; Hult et al., 2004;\nSalavou, 2004; Bates and Khasawneh, 2005; Brennan and Dooley, 2005; Merx-\nChermin and Hijhof, 2005). This learning orientation is a culture that supports the\ngeneration of knowledge through a variety of channels, such as learning from past\nprojects or obtaining knowledge external to the organisation. Learning here suggests\nthat the organisation also utilises the knowledge that has been gained through the\nlearning process. Organisations that have a high level of learning orientation and\nknowledge generation use the knowledge to generate and develop new ideas.\n11\nAccordingly, the more often organisations exploit their knowledge resources then the\ngreater chance they have of increasing the number of innovations they develop\n(Pavitt, 2002). Organisations that learn from their mistakes have a different type of\nculture from those organisations that relinquish when they make a mistake.\nAlthough in this section we have identified some of the direct relationships culture has\nwith the other factors, it also has residual effects on other factors within the model.\nThese effects will be discussed further in the analysis of the model.\nAnalysis of Model\nAs we have discussed, organisational culture permeates all of the factors in the model\nand it is inappropriate to separate culture from each of the factors. The culture that\nengenders innovation is often described as open, where creativity and risk taking are\nencouraged and information freely flows around the organisation (Roffe, 1999;\nCalatone et al., 2002; Wan et al, 2005). The shared vision of an organisation that\nsupports and encourages idea generation and development needs to be put in place\nbefore other changes can be made to the organisational factors.\nManagement style and leadership, Resources, Employees and Innovation process.\nThe literature supports the view that employees that are empowered and autonomous\nhave a greater degree of control over their work. This degree of control means that\nemployees feel comfortable in their role to be innovative in their own work\nenvironment (Thamhain, 1990; Tang, 1999; Zwetsloot, 2001; Amar, 2004; Mostafa,\n2005; Muthusamy et al., 2005; Nystrom et al., 2002). However, some authors argue\nthat the level of management support given to empowered employees will affect their\nability to innovate (Knight, 1987; Tang, 1999; Martins and Terblanche, 2003;\nMostafa, 2005); therefore employees must not feel alone in the pursuit of innovation.\nAlthough employees are fundamental to the generation and development of new ideas\nthe literature argues that employees need to be given sufficient resources, in time,\nmaterials and finance to allow ideas to emerge (Thamhain, 1990; Avlonitis et al.,\n1994; Pavitt, 2002; Hyland and Beckett, 2005; Mostafa, 2005). It is therefore the role\nof management to ensure that the innovation process comes to fruition and that\nemployees know how to interact with the innovation process (Vandermerwe, 1987;\nJohnson, 1990).\nOrganisational structure and Employees. Organisational structure directly\ninfluences employees within the organisation and this is done through a number of\nchannels such as the way teams are organised and the degree of formality. The\norganisational structure can often dictate the nature of the jobs in the organisation\n(Meadows, 1980; Koberg et al., 1996; Hage, 1999; Lewis and Moultrie, 2005). While\nlone employees can develop innovations, teams of employees will be more important\nin influencing overall ability of the organisation to innovate (Anderson and West,\n1998; Read, 2000; Lemon and Sahota, 2004; Noke and Radnor, 2004; Muthusamy et\nal., 2005). The use of team-based working is dependant on other factors such as open\nand collaborative organisational culture and participatory management style therefore\nemployees working in teams will be more open to discuss and implement new ideas\nwithin their teams.\nCorporate strategy and Employees. The corporate strategy needs to be developed to\nreflect the organisational culture and communicate the shared vision and goals of the\n12\norganisation (Cottam et al., 2001; Ng, 2004; Jager et al., 2004). All employees of the\norganisation need to understand how the corporate strategy impacts upon their jobs\nand what they need to do to help the organisation achieve their goals (Pearson et al.,\n1989). Therefore, if an organisation wants to be more effective at developing\ninnovations this needs to be reflected somewhere within the corporate strategy,\notherwise employees will not see how innovation directly impacts on their day-to-day\ntasks.\nTechnology, Knowledge management and Employees. Technology indirectly\nimpacts employees through knowledge management this is because ICT is commonly\nused as a facilitator of knowledge transfer (Sorensen and Stuart, 2000; Kandampully,\n2002); drawing together fragmented knowledge resources to develop a single\nknowledge repository (Ettlie, 1980; Damanpour, 1987; Jantunen, 2005). This means\nthat employees can gain access to a wide based of knowledge that is collected\nthroughout and beyond the organisation, and having this information readily available\ncan support employees in the development of new ideas. Successfully using\nknowledge and learning tools, such as a knowledge repository, to feed into the\ninnovation process results in an integrated approach to new idea development and\nimplementation (Neely et al., 2001; Aranda and Molina-Fernandez, 2002).\nTechnology and Innovation process. The innovation process is the only endogenous\nfactor within the model, meaning that is derived internally by other factors within the\nmodel. It is affected by the employees, the management style and leadership of the\norganisation and the technology used to enable the management of the process.\nTechnology is often used in a supportive role to alleviate various stages of the\ninnovation process (Watts et al., 1998; Petroni, 1998; Loewe and Dominiquini, 2006).\nMore often than not technology is discussed in relation to the \u2018fuzzy\u2019 front end of the\ninnovation process. This is the stage of the innovation process where ideas are\ngenerated and that is difficult to capture and explain, hence the use of technology to\nfacilitate useful idea generation. Technologies such as virtual reality (Watts et al.,\n1998) and group work software (Klein and Dologite, 2000; Pissarra and Jesuino,\n2005) all have a place in the innovation process.\nEmployees and Innovation process. Our model identifies employees as the conduit\nbetween the organisational factors and the innovation process. They play a central\nrole in developing ideas as inputs into the innovation process and without ideas the\ninnovation process simply would not function. The literature highlights that the\nemployees of the organisation are a potential rich source of ideas and they should be\nencouraged to take part in the early stages to ensure a constant supply of ideas is\ngenerated to input into the innovation process (Woodman et al., 1993; Guimaraes and\nLangley, 1994; Andriopoulos and Lowe, 2000; McAdam and McClelland, 2002;\nThamhain, 2003; Wood, 2003). Some authors do stress that employees need to be\ntrained and educated before they can have a positive impact on the innovation process\n(Koen and Kohli, 1998; Loewe and Dominiquini, 2003; Pohlmann et al., 2005;\nBrennan and Dooley, 2005; Shipton et al., 2006).\nIn this section we have identified each of the commonly cited relationships and have\nexamined the nature of the relationships that exist between the factors. The analysis\nof the model has highlighted that the relationships between the factors are complex\nand it can be difficult to tease out the main relationships existing between the factors.\n13\nHowever, we have presented a view of the factors absent from the innovation\nmanagement literature.\nDiscussion\nFrequently innovation management literature discusses the factors that affect\norganisations\u2019 ability to innovate in a way that treats the factors as mutually exclusive,\nmeaning that each factor has an individual impact on innovation. However the\nrelationships between the factors and the impact these relationships have on\ninnovation are largely ignored. This means that the cumulative effect of the factors\nand their relationships are not fully understood. This paper has shown that there are a\nnumber of important relationships that need to be examined in greater detail to\nunderstand how their effects impact on an organisation\u2019s ability to manage\ninnovation.\nFigure 1 shows that the innovation process is the factor that is impacted in some way\nby all other factors which can be deemed as the pinnacle factor that needs to be in\nplace for organisations to successfully manage innovation. Looking at the model in\nfigure 1 it can be seen that a number of the factors are exogenous which means they\nare not impacted by other factors within the model, these factors group together to\nimpact on knowledge management, employees and the innovation process. Therefore,\nwe have condensed this collection of factors into one group. This leads to the model\nbeing considered in a more simplistic way, taking the structure of a pyramid, figure 2\nhighlights how the model can be restructured.\nFigure 2. Factors of innovation pyramid\n14\nThe exogenous factors, that have been grouped together, form the base of the\npyramid. This shows that they are the foundation factors that define an organisation,\nsuch as the organisational structure and corporate strategy. Knowledge management\nand employees are the conduit between the organisation and the innovation process.\nIt is the employees of the organisation that \u2018feed\u2019 the innovation process with ideas.\nThe innovation process is placed at the top of the pyramid as this is the only\nendogenous factor within the model in figure 1. The role of organisational culture is\none that is continuously developing and evolving. As changes are made in the levels\nof the pyramid the organisational culture also changes and provides a virtuous (or\nvicious) circle of culture that engenders (or inhibits) innovation.\nThis paper has looked at the factors that influence innovation in a different way. We\nhave endeavoured to understand the complex relationships that exist between the\nfactors affecting innovation management to allow for a more complex view of\ninnovation in the organisational context. By adopting a holistic view we can see that\nchanging the nature of some factors can impact on other factors which might have a\npositive effect on the way innovation in managed in companies.\nThe key emerging issues identified in this paper are that some factors that impact\ninnovation are more important than others. This paper has also drawn attention to the\nneed to understand the effects the inter-factor relationships have on an organisations\nability to manage innovation. There is little empirical evidence on the way\nrelationships affect innovation, it could be that two or more factors being used\ntogether in an coherent way is more effective in stimulating innovation that the factors\nare on their own. It is this systems view that is missing from current thinking on\ninnovation management in organisations.\nConclusions\nThe research presented in this paper draws three main conclusions. Firstly, there are 9\nimportant factors that impact on an organisation\u2019s ability to manage innovation,\nnamely; management style and leadership, resources, organisational structure,\ntechnology, knowledge management, corporate strategy, employees, and the\ninnovation process.\nSecondly, organisational culture is a key factor in the management of innovation. It is\na factor that impacts all others and is also impacted upon by changes in the other\nfactors. Therefore we can conclude that organisational culture emerges and develops\nthrough changes in the other factors.\nThirdly, the common relationships that exist among these 9 factors and how can\nimpact on the management of innovation have been identified. By examining these\nrelationships it can be seen that there are a number of exogenous factors that are not\nimpacted by any other factors within the model. These exogenous factors are\ntechnology, organisational structure, resources and management style and leadership.\nThis means that these factors play an important role in the antecedent phase of\neffective innovation management. The innovation process is the only endogenous\nfactor within the model which means that it does not impact on any other factor within\nthe model although it is influenced by other factors within the model. This means that\nthe innovation process is a key factor to which all other factors impact which suggests\n15\nthat the other factors impact an organisations ability to manage innovation through the\nmediating effect of the innovation process.\nPractical Implications\nThe managerial implications of this work are twofold. Firstly, organisations can\nunderstand how the 9 factors influence their ability to mange innovation and can\nconsider the nature of the factors currently within their organisations. Secondly,\norganisations can understand that these factors do not operate independent of each\nother but are interrelated. They can use the model as a thinking tool to begin to\nunderstand that leveraging one factor will impact on a range of other factors.\nFigure 2 provides organisations with a graphical representation of the findings of this\nstudy. This can be used to develop an understanding of how the factors piece together\nwithin their own organisational context.\nThe practical implication this research provides to scholars is that it provides a\nconceptual framework to build further research on. As the model presented in this\npaper is inductively developed from literature it therefore needs to be tested in\nsubsequent empirical studies in order to test its validity and relevance. The model can\nbe used to develop a series of hypothesises which can be tested within organisations\nto understand if the relationships identified from literature actually exist within the\norganisational context.\nLimitations and Further Research\nThe literature on innovation is diverse and complex, and covers many different\nsubject areas and research fields. This can make it difficult for academics and\npractitioners alike to understand the wide-ranging organisational factors that can\ninfluence an organisation\u2019s ability to become more innovative. There is agreement in\nthe literature that due to the complexities associated with innovation research, we will\nnever generate one true theory or best practice of innovation (Tidd, 2001). What is\napparent is that the theories discussed hold true in various circumstances, such as;\nrelating to life-cycle stage of the organisation (Koberg et al., 1996; Sorensen and\nStuart, 2000), to the stage of development of the innovation (Gopalakrishnan and\nDamanpour, 1994), the type of innovation pursued (Damanpour, 1987; Damanpour et\nal., 1989) and the wider environment that the organisation operates within (Koberg et\nal., 1996; Brennan and Dooley, 2005). This contingency approach for generating\ntheory is common in innovation research (e.g. Wolfe, 1994; Damanpour, 1996), but\nwhat is also important is the role of the relationships between the factors which\ninfluence an organisations ability to manage innovation. The relationships between\nfactors will be influenced by organisational context such as organisational size, age\nand the external environment which are contingent factors. Although this paper has\nnot examined the influence the contingency factors have on the relationships, we\nacknowledge that these factors are important to future research. Further work needs\nto be undertaken to understand how contingency factors will alter the relationships\ndiscussed in this paper, by contextualising any future empirical work based on a\ncontingent approach.\n16\nReferences\nThe references are highlighted in bold come from the systematic literature review\nprocess and have been directly used for the development the relationship diagram in\nfigure 1.\nAdams, R., Bessant, J., and Phelps, R.
