On\nthe wider level, too, the Aum affair raised basic questions about the\nrelationship between religion, society, and state in a modern, liberal\nsociety and about the extent to which such societies should offer protec-\ntion to, and tolerate the existence of, religious movements that are in-\nimical to normative social values. The affair also raised questions about\nthe tax benefits given to religious movements and about the ways in\nwhich religious movements acquire their wealth. Such issues gave a pow-\nerful boost to the development of an anticult movement in Japan and\ngave added impetus to an aggressive mass media keen to expose \u201cdevi-\nant\u201d religious groups. The Aum affair also damaged the ability of aca-\ndemics in the field to offer balanced judgments on new movements and\nvirtually silenced academic researchers in the debates that arose during\nthe post-Aum moral panic that gripped Japan.\n226\nNova Religio\nPARADIGM SHIFTS AND CHANGING ERAS: THE POSTWAR\nCONSENSUS AND ITS ORIGINS\nThe Aum affair is a watershed moment in modern Japanese reli-\ngious history, with scholars now referring to this as the post-Aum era\n(posuto Oumu jidai). This new era has seen a paradigm shift in public\nperceptions about the relationship between religion, state, and society,\nwith the consensus that existed from the end of World War II until 1995\nbeing replaced by one that is far less favorably disposed to the religious\nsphere. To understand this change one needs to look briefly first at the\nfactors that shaped the pre-Aum consensus.\nThe prevailing liberal democratic ethos upon which post-war Japa-\nnese society and the Japanese constitution of 1946 were based viewed\nreligious movements as needing guaranteed protection from the possi-\nbilities of state intrusion and oppression. This view\uf8e7and the resulting\nconstitutional and legal safeguards\uf8e7were a direct response to the re-\npressive policies of pre-1945 Japan. These policies had transformed\nShint\u00f4 into a state religion centered on the Emperor as a unifying sym-\nbol of the nation and used this state religion to justify Japan\u2019s colonial\nand war-mongering policies. As Japan descended in the 1930s into its\n\u201cblack valley\u201d (kurodani) of fascism and militarism, those who raised dis-\nsenting voices were invariably suppressed.\nOne movement so suppressed was the highly successful millenarian\nnew religion, \u00d4motoky\u00f4, whose leader Deguchi \u00d4nisabur\u00f41 portrayed\nhimself as a world savior while symbolically challenging the sacred sta-\ntus of the Emperor. Twice, in 1921 and most severely in 1935, \u00d4motoky\u00f4\nwas subjected to police raids, the incarceration of its leaders, and the\nrazing of its religious centers. By responding to Deguchi\u2019s challenges\nand crushing \u00d4motoky\u00f4, the state displayed its readiness to use force\nagainst any religion that opposed its ideology or threatened its power.\nHereafter most religious movements in Japan\uf8e7cowed either by fear of\nrepression or motivated by a culturally and religiously ordained ideol-\nogy of nationalism\uf8e7fell into line with government dictates and with\nJapan\u2019s ideologically driven military expansion.2  The few that did not\nwere suppressed and their leaders imprisoned.\nAfter Japan\u2019s defeat in 1945 the American-dominated Occupation\ngovernment promulgated a new, liberal constitution. Recognizing that\nreligious repression had been crucial to the rise of fascism, the govern-\nment implemented laws and constitutional articles formally separating\nreligion and state, affording the right of freedom of religion to all, and\ngranting religious organizations protection from state interference.\nThese notions of individual religious freedom and the rights of reli-\ngious groups became basic foundations for the modern, secular, liberal\ndemocratic state that emerged after the war.\n   227\n      Reader: Consensus Shattered\nSuch constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms did not neces-\nsarily transform Japan into a haven of religious tolerance. While free\nfrom the fear of state repression, religious movements found themselves\nsubject to scrutiny (and frequent hostile attack) from the free press that\nemerged after the war. Indeed, it could be argued that the mass media\nin general took upon itself the role of public policeman of religious\nmovements, publishing numerous expos\u00e9s of religious organizations for\nfinancial irregularities and other scandals. While the media delighted\nin reporting misdeeds across the religious spectrum, from the financial\nmisdeeds of Buddhist temples to the closet right-wing nationalist politi-\ncal associations of certain Shint\u00f4 shrines, it was the new religions that\nbore the brunt of such criticism. They were frequently portrayed as du-\nbious organizations intent on manipulating and cheating the gullible\nmasses of their money.\nNevertheless, until 1995, religious movements were largely free from\nexternal intrusion. The civil authorities, fearful that any such action\nwould be seen as an attempt to turn the clock back, rarely looked into\nthe affairs of groups that were registered under the Japanese Religious\nCorporations Law, even when evidence of malpractice existed. This atti-\ntude helped Aum; although widely suspected of numerous crimes prior\nto the subway attack, it was not properly investigated, largely because\nthe police feared being accused of breaching constitutional safeguards\nagainst religious persecution.\nCONSENSUS SHATTERED\nThis consensus was effectively shattered in March 1995 when public\nopinion and political necessity demanded a decisive police response to\nAum\u2019s atrocities. That response\uf8e7including mass raids on Aum centers\nand prominent displays of weapons, shields, and other military\nequipment\uf8e7aroused for some observers disturbing parallels to the pre-\nwar militaristic assaults on \u00d4motoky\u00f4. The general public, however, fully\nsupported the raids, turning a blind eye to any possible breaches of the\ncivil liberties of Aum members and widely agreeing with the arrests,\ntrials, and sentences (including several death sentences) passed on Aum\nleaders.\nIt was not just the immediate trauma of the Aum affair that affected\npublic opinion and convinced the political authorities that they had to\nreact. It was also the revelations that Aum had gathered a large amount\nof materials and weapons for the purpose of committing further vio-\nlence against the populace.3  This trend in public opinion has been a\nmajor factor in shaping attitudes to new religions in the post-Aum era.\nIt has also encouraged the media to give saturation coverage to the Aum\n228\nNova Religio\naffair, endlessly reporting rumors, allegations, and facts, bringing in\nnumerous \u201cexperts\u201d (mostly critics who denounce Aum as a nefarious\n\u201ccult\u201d) to discuss the affair and its possible meanings for Japan, and\nengaging in new expos\u00e9s of Aum and other movements that might\uf8e7in\nthe media\u2019s perspective\uf8e7turn out to be \u201cdangerous.\u201d\nAum provided Japan with an example of what might happen if reli-\ngious movements were left unchecked. In the popular view the affair\nappeared to indicate that certain types of movements, especially ones\nthat, like Aum, preached a message of rejection of normative social mores\nand values and that aspired to the formation of a new spiritual order,\nmight prove dangerous to society. The new consensus that has emerged\nas a result is one which places less weight on the idea of protecting reli-\ngious movements from the state, and which is more concerned with\nprotecting state, society, and the general public from the potential dan-\ngers of religious groups.\nPOLITICAL AND PUBLIC RESPONSES TO AUM\nIt was hardly surprising that the government felt impelled to amend\nthe laws relating to religious movements. Some rather anodyne changes\nwere made to the Religious Corporations Laws, while the question of\nwhether to ban Aum\uf8e7an action that raised major questions about indi-\nvidual religious freedoms\uf8e7was given serious consideration. A commis-\nsion was established to determine whether Aum could be proscribed\nunder the Anti-Subversives Law (a repressive law implemented in 1952\nas an anti-Communist measure, but never before applied to any move-\nment), but it decided that Aum no longer posed a threat to public safety\nand hence should not be banned. This decision was greeted with relief\nby liberals who feared that using this act against Aum would set a dan-\ngerous precedent for future religious repression, but was resented by\nmany who saw it as an act of excessive tolerance toward an undeserving\nmovement. This was the view of the Japanese Public Security Intelli-\ngence Agency, which would have overseen the use of the Anti-Subversives\nLaw against Aum, and which has since sought to persuade the authori-\nties to reconsider this decision.4  Its concerns, and those of the wider\npublic, were recognized by the government in 1999 when it passed a\nnew law (described by some as \u201cdraconian\u201d) aimed specifically at Aum.\nThe law required the movement to keep authorities closely informed of\nall its affairs and membership records.\nAlthough Aum\u2019s new leaders have tried to distance themselves from\ntheir imprisoned guru Asahara Sh\u00f4k\u00f4 and his entourage and have de-\nclared that Aum is now a peaceful movement, it remains suspect to the\nJapanese public. Such is the continuing fear of Aum that wherever Aum\n   229\n      Reader: Consensus Shattered\nmembers have tried to establish homes or centers they have faced pro-\ntests from local citizens\u2019 groups, landlords have sought to evict Aum\nfollowers from their homes, and local authorities have refused to allow\nthe children of Aum devotees to enter schools.\nMany of these actions have been illegal\uf8e7and have been declared so\nby court rulings\uf8e7but public opinion and media sympathies are very\nmuch on the side of protesters against Aum. As a Japanese friend living\nin Tokyo told me, he wanted\uf8e7whatever the cost to civil rights\uf8e7Aum to\nbe disbanded and its followers made to renounce their beliefs. He and\nhis family regularly used the subway and, although he was not person-\nally injured in the attack, it had left a strong enough impression for him\nto fear that Aum still posed a threat to the well-being of his family. The\nfreedom to follow one\u2019s own religion was secondary to the rights of\nothers to go about their business safely, a point that is readily under-\nstandable given the circumstances of the Aum affair.\nSuch perceptions have conditioned attitudes not just toward Aum\nbut to NRMs in general. Aum\u2019s continuing existence provides a con-\nstant reminder to the Japanese public concerning the potential dan-\ngers that might come from certain kinds of religious movements. This\nviewpoint has been widely articulated in the mass media which, never a\nshrinking violet where new religions and hints of scandal are concerned,\nhave been emboldened to mount further high profile investigations of\npotentially \u201cdeviant\u201d movements. Equally, the police, whose earlier re-\nluctance to get involved with Aum was quite conspicuous, have been\nkeen not to repeat the error, and have exhibited a greater readiness to\ninvestigate scandals surrounding registered religious groups. When, for\nexample, allegations were made by disaffected former members against\nH\u00f4nohana Sanp\u00f4gy\u00f4, a new religion which promotes costly divination\npractices, and the movement became subject to an intensive media\nexpos\u00e9, the police began investigations which led to H\u00f4nohana leader\nFukunaga H\u00f4gen\u2019s arrest on fraud charges. One suspects that, prior to\nthe Aum affair, the former members would have been less vocal in air-\ning their grievances\uf8e7or in demanding recompense from the\nmovement\uf8e7and the police far less likely to have intervened.\n\u201cDANGEROUS CULTS\u201c AND THE RISE\nOF THE ANTICULT MOVEMENT\nThis climate of public hostility towards NRMs has been exacerbated\nby the emergence of an \u201canticult\u201d movement that has all but drowned\nout alternative voices and perspectives. This movement, which barely\nexisted prior to the Aum affair, grew rapidly in its aftermath, spurred by\nthe activities of anticult activists from the United States such as Steve\n230\nNova Religio\nHassan. Hassan visited Japan shortly after the subway attack to speak\nabout the practice of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d in \u201ccults\u201d such as Aum.5  Such views,\nwhich provided an easily grasped populist explanation of Aum, were\ncongruent with those of Aum\u2019s critics who, prior to the subway attack,\nhad argued that Asahara and his lieutenants had exerted some form of\n\u201cmind control\u201d over their followers.6  The subway attack appeared to\nconfirm, in public perception, the accuracy of such accusations, and\nthose who had spoken against Aum were consequently transformed into\n\u201cexperts\u201d not just on Aum but on \u201ccults\u201d in general. These critics be-\ncame articulate proponents of an anticult movement that was quickly\nable to establish itself as an authoritative pressure group.\nThe workings of the anticult movement in Japan\uf8e7especially its\nrhetoric\uf8e7will not be unfamiliar to outside observers. The term \u201ccult\u201d\n(Japanese: karuto) has entered the Japanese language with very similar\nmeanings and connotations to the English media use of the term. Thus,\nkaruto in Japanese connotes a dangerous movement run by a manipula-\ntive and fraudulent figure who poses as a religious teacher (but whose\nreal interests are power, money, and sex) and who \u201cbrainwashes\u201d his\ndevotees into following his every beck and call.\nWhile the term karuto was used in Japan prior to the Aum affair, it\nhas subsequently become dominant in public discourse. In this process,\nthe quasi-distinction made in many Western media discussions of new\nmovements between \u201creligions\u201d (genuine, upstanding movements) and\n\u201ccults\u201d (evil, fraudulent, and dishonest) has become commonplace. Many\nJapanese religious organizations have contributed to this perception by\naffirming their respectability and commitment to normative\nvalues\uf8e7while simultaneously condemning Aum\uf8e7by giving their sup-\nport to anticult campaigns, and by sending out warnings about \u201cdanger-\nous\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d (rival) religious movements.7\nThese perceptions about the dangers of cults have given rise to vari-\nous alarmist books and articles that seek to identify the \u201cnext Aum\u201d (i.e.\nthe next group that might become dangerous and cause social disrup-\ntion). One of the groups so targeted has been S\u00f4ka Gakkai. The move-\nment was persecuted for its opposition to the wartime government\u2019s\nmilitarism but it is now the largest religious organization in Japan. S\u00f4ka\nGakkai, more than almost any other movement prior to Aum, had pro-\nvoked public opprobrium because of its aggressive recruitment policies\nand its strongly developed political base. These developments had caused\nconcern that S\u00f4ka Gakkai might threaten the post-war constitutional\nseparation of religion and state. Thus, it was not surprising that the group\nwas one of the movements labeled as potentially \u201canother Aum.\u201d8\nSpace does not permit further discussion of all the movements or\ntypes of movement that have been tarred as \u201ccults.\u201d It is, however, my\nsuspicion that beneath the surface there may be a further disturbing\npattern of intolerance emerging in Japan. Based on various surveys that\n   231\n      Reader: Consensus Shattered\nI have done of anticult literature in Japanese bookshops, the term \u201ccult\u201d\nhas been applied less to Japanese NRMs that have embraced the com-\nmon assumptions shared within the Japanese religious world, than it\nhas to imports from abroad. Implicit in the term \u201ccult,\u201d in other words,\nare not just ideas of being deviant but also connotations of \u201cforeign\u201d\nand \u201cnot Japanese.\u201d Here one should note that many of Aum\u2019s charac-\nteristics were drawn from external traditions (notably Tibet and India)\nand that it adopted a self-consciously \u201cdifferent\u201d (and inherently\nnonnormative Japanese) style.\nThe two movements most frequently portrayed in such terms are\nthe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and the Unification Movement, both of which\nhave been active in Japan in recent decades and both of which have\nacquired reputations for being socially disruptive and divisive. Both had\nbeen involved in scandals and conflicts before the Aum affair, examples\nincluding the Unification Movement\u2019s alleged role in extorting large\nsums of money from unsuspecting clients through aggressive spiritual\npurification sales schemes, and the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 unusual teach-\nings concerning surgery and blood transfusions. Both, too, are seen as\n\u201cforeign\u201d movements that infringe on Japanese social sensibilities by\ndemanding their followers\u2019 full adherence. The groups are accused of\nwithdrawing from the normative round of rituals that are part of the\nJapanese religious and social calendar and aligning instead with iden-\ntity groupings that are in conflict with normative Japanese social values.\nThe apparent identification in popular discourse of these two move-\nments (and of \u201ccults\u201d in general) as highly deviant and dangerous was\nillustrated for me during a recent visit to one of Japan\u2019s largest book-\nshops, Kiinokuniya in Shinjuku, Tokyo. There I found that books about\nAum were shelved not under \u201cReligion\u201d but in the section on criminal\norganizations, alongside works on the yakuza (Japanese gangsters) and\nthe Mafia, and next to books on crime, serial killers, and mass murder-\ners. Perhaps, given that Aum had killed at least twenty-five people, I\nshould not have been too surprised at this\uf8e7or indeed, given their re-\nspective death tolls, the presence there of books in Japanese on Peoples\nTemple and the Order of the Solar Temple. What took me aback, how-\never, was that books denouncing the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and the Unifi-\ncation Movement were placed alongside these. It was as if the book-\nshop\u2019s shelving policies had been determined by the agenda of the\nanticult movement. It certainly reflected a disturbing pattern of think-\ning in Japan, in which deviance from norms in the religious context is\nequated with the sinister and the murderous. I would also suggest\uf8e7if\nmy (admittedly rather fleeting) observations are correct\uf8e7that the preva-\nlence, in modern Japan, of Japanocentric modes of identity discourse\nthat are clearly anti-Western and anti-foreign9  has, if anything, become\nintensified after the Aum affair, with certain movements identified as\n\u201cdangerous\u201d largely because of their foreign provenance. These sub-\n232\nNova Religio\nliminal associations of danger, deviance, and foreign appear, in other\nwords, to be becoming alarmingly overt in populist discourse.\nTHE MUTED VOICES OF ACADEMIA\nThe emergence of the anticult movement as a force claiming au-\nthority in the sphere of new religions clearly suggests parallels with many\nWestern countries. However, what is striking about the situation in Ja-\npan is that the voices of scholars who could provide informed perspec-\ntives have become muted almost to the point of nonexistence. In part\nthis is because of the vociferous success of anticult activists who seized\nthe post-Aum high moral ground. It was aided by the misinterpretations\nof a small number of scholars in Japan and elsewhere who appeared to\ngive support to Aum when it was first accused of criminal behavior. While\nthe American scholars who visited Japan after the subway attack to ex-\namine possible human rights violations against Aum were motivated by\na concern for human rights, their actions reflected a tacit assumption\nprevalent among many scholars that NRMs accused of atrocities are\nnormally innocent. On this score, it was fascinating to note how differ-\nent interest groups involved in the sphere of \u201ccult wars\u201d in the United\nStates acted out similar and contrasting agendas in Japan over Aum.\nHassan and his fellow anticultists leapt to unsubstantiated conclusions\nabout brainwashing, and supporters of AWARE assumed that Aum must\nhave been a victim. This particular visit, coming on top of misjudgments\nby two Japanese academics, backfired because of Aum\u2019s swiftly proven\nguilt. It also seemed to confirm the arguments made by prominent\nanticult activists in Japan that academics are apologists for dangerous\nand deviant groups.10\nOnly a very few scholars so erred, and most Western and Japanese\nNRM scholars made no attempt to defend Aum or to do anything other\nthan interpret its criminal actions. Still, the prevailing image has been\nof academic compliance with cults, with scholars who discuss movements\nsuch as Aum in any terms other than those of cultic deviance and evil\nseen as little more than apologists. It is small wonder, then, that at present\nthe opportunity for Japanese scholars to present an alternative to the\nviews of the anticult movement has been severely curtailed. Scholars in\nmany Western countries are certainly not unfamiliar with such scenarios\nand are well aware that presenting other than condemnatory views on\nNRMs can bring similar accusations. However, it is clear that the voices\nof academics are to some extent now heard by civil authorities and law\nenforcement agencies in countries such as the United Kingdom and\nthe United States. In Japan, on the other hand, there appear to be no\ncounterbalancing arguments in the debates over dangerous cults. This,\nin turn, has intensified the hostile environment for NRMs in the post-\nAum era.\n   233\n      Reader: Consensus Shattered\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nThe above brief overview indicates that Japan has entered into a new\nera in which certain types of movements (which, it should be empha-\nsized, have never had a good press) have come to be viewed as increas-\ningly dangerous and suspect. The primary catalyst for producing this\nclimate has been the Aum affair, which has redrawn the picture of the\npost-war religious world and reshaped the relationship between society\nand religion. At present, the predominant trends\uf8e7with a rampant press,\nan aggressive anticult movement, a population ready to accede to dra-\nconian laws against suspect groups, law enforcement agencies prepared\nto investigate religious movements, and few alternative voices capable\nof being heard\uf8e7presage an inauspicious immediate future for emer-\ngent religious groups.\nYet I should append a caveat to this gloomy picture. It is important\nto note that the Japanese experiment with freedom of religion is still in\nits infancy and dates only from 1946. Such freedom\uf8e7which includes\nboth the freedom of citizens to follow the religious paths they wish, and\nthe freedom of religious organizations to function without state\ninterference\uf8e7comes at a price and is dependent on an implicit con-\ntract of trust. It demands that state and society should respect the free-\ndom of religious worship, allow religious organizations to follow their\nown beliefs and practices, and refrain from interference in such groups.\nIt also demands that religious movements show tolerance and respect\nfor the safety, freedoms, and views of others and for the laws of society.\nThe first major challenge to this fledgling democratic understand-\ning of religious freedoms came not from the state, the mass media, or\nfrom anticult campaigners, but from a religious movement that was in-\ncapable of accepting criticism, enduring opposition or, indeed, tolerat-\ning internal dissent. After Aum, the authorities could have taken more\ndrastic steps or enacted even harsher laws against religious movements\nand still gained public approval. Yet, even in a period of moral panic\nand hysteria, this has not been done. The only repressive new law is\ndirected solely at Aum. Even so Aum has retained its right to exist, and\nthe courts have upheld the basic democratic rights of its members. These\ndevelopments indicate that, despite the current public mood, the Japa-\nnese authorities remain committed to the tenets of religious freedom,\nalbeit in a more qualified manner than prior to Aum. While the previ-\nous consensus is now dead and while Japanese NRMs can no longer\nenjoy the privilege of being virtually above the law, there are at least\nsome indications that whatever new consensus might eventually emerge\nwill not cause their existing rights to be wholly swept aside.\n234\nNova Religio\nENDNOTES\n1 All proper names in this paper are given according to Japanese style, with the family\nname first and the given name second.\n2 One should note that many movements, including Buddhist sects and new religions,\nembraced the rampant nationalism of the era: see, for example, Robert Sharf, \u201cThe Zen\nof Japanese Nationalism,\u201d History of Religions 33, no. 1 (1993): 1-43.\n3 For a fuller discussion of this and other aspects of the Aum affair see Ian Reader, Reli-\ngious Violence in Contemporary Japan: The Case of Aum Shinriky\u00f4 (Richmond, U.K., and Hono-\nlulu, Hawaii: Curzon Press and University of Hawaii Press, 2000).\n4 Officials of the agency were widely quoted in articles in the Japanese and foreign\nmedia\uf8e7especially during 1997 and 1998\uf8e7that have raised fears about a resurgent Aum.\nHowever, the agency sources have invariably cited grossly exaggerated membership fig-\nures for Aum, raising suspicions that its \u201cinformation\u201d has been deliberately modified for\npolitical reasons.\n5 For a discussion of the emergence of the anticult movement in Japan see Watanabe\nManabu, \u201cReactions to the Aum Affair: The Rise of the \u2018Anti-cult\u2019 Movement,\u201d Bulletin of\nthe Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture 21 (1997): 32-48.\n6 See, for example, Egawa Sh\u00f4ko, Ky\u00fbseishu no yab\u00f4 (Tokyo: Ky\u00f4ikushiry\u00f4 Shuppankai,\n1991).\n7 K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku, for example, which had already attacked various rivals as \u201cfalse reli-\ngions\u201d (jaky\u00f4) prior to 1995, stepped up its attacks further after the Aum affair, while its\nleader \u00d4kawa Ry\u00fbh\u00f4 gave a number of sermons in 1995 about the \u201cdangers\u201d of such \u201cfalse\nreligions.\u201d See Okawa Ry\u00fbh\u00f4, Jinsei seik\u00f4 no hissaku (Tokyo: K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku Shuppan,\n1995) especially 163ff.\n8 Noda Mineo, Ikeda Daisaku zenmyaku no kenky\u00fb (Tokyo: Miyai Shob\u00f4, 1997).\n9 There is plentiful material on this widespread discourse (known in Japan as Nihonjinron\nor \u201cdiscussions about Japaneseness\u201d) on Japanese modes of identity.
