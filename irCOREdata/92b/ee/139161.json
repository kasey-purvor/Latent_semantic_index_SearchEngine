Introduction\nFreshwater coastal ecosystems are intrinsically vulnerable to environmental degradation given their\nproximity to the sea, low water volume, generally low elevation and pressures from coastal\ndevelopment, abstraction and agriculture (UNEP, 2006). Shallow lakes respond more directly to\nprevailing weather conditions than deeper lakes due to their smaller volume and lack of\nstratification (Gerten and Adrian, 2001; Mooij et al., 2007), and wind\u2013wave action easily penetrates\nto the lake bottom. As a result, sediment and nutrients in shallow lakes, unlike in deeper lakes, are\nconstantly mixing in or with the water column. The water level regime is an important factor for\nlake ecosystem functioning and affects conservation values (Coops et al., 2003). Levels naturally\nfluctuate due to variations in climatic conditions and human activities (Blindlow, 1992), which can\n3cause disturbance for submerged plant communities. Excessive high water levels in the growing\nseason will reduce light availability while low water levels may damage plants due to ice and wave\naction during winter or desiccation in summer (Coops et al., 2003). There is consequently an\nincreasing need for sustainable water management to contribute to the conservation of these\nimportant ecosystems (Janse et al., 2008; Reed et al., 2008; Tatrai et al., 2008). Understanding the\nhydrological processes controlling the current behaviour of shallow lakes is therefore fundamental\nto the current and long term management of these ecologically-important waterbodies and to\nunderstanding their resilience to future climate change.\nThe coastal Bosherston Lakes in west Wales, UK (Figure 1) (51.617oN, -4.925oW), are an\noutstanding shallow marl lake system which has been classified under the European Habitats\nDirective as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to its habitat of \u201cHard oligo-mesotrophic\nwaters with benthic vegetation of Chara spp.\u201d. Charophytes or Stoneworts (Stewart, 2004) are\nrepresented by bristly stonewort Chara hispida which forms dense beds up to 1 m high, with\nindividual plants up to 3.5 m long, and by variable quantities of C. globularis, C. virgata and C.\nvulgaris. The lakes are fed by two small streams but it is thought that there is considerable\ninteraction between the lake and the groundwater within the underlying karstic limestone aquifer\n(Rees and Hinton, 1989). Given their proximity to the sea and shallow water depths of 1-3 m, there\nare many threats to this fragile freshwater ecosystem. In particular the lakes are vulnerable to\nsiltation, nutrient enrichment (both through groundwater and surface water inflows) and drought\n(leading to low water levels). They have a history of catchment eutrophication during the early to\nlate 20th Century with declining water quality due to sewage inputs (now ceased) and increasingly\nintensive agriculture in the catchment (Rees et al., 1991), but the apportionment of flows and\nnutrient fluxes to the lake from groundwater and surface water are poorly understood. As a result\nthe system is classified as being in unfavourable condition due to eutrophication and insufficient\nChara cover (Burgess et al., 2006), although the Central Arm and Western Arm are classified as\n4being in favourable condition. This paper therefore describes the application of the Soil Water\nAssessment Tool (or SWAT model) to provide a quantitative understanding of the hydrological\nprocesses controlling lake water levels, flushing rates and groundwater-surface water interactions,\nas part of the long term conservation of this internationally important shallow freshwater lake\nsystem.\n[Figure 1 around here]\n2. The study area\n2.1 The lake system\nBosherston Lakes is a system of shallow linked lakes lying close to sea level within the Stackpole\nNational Nature Reserve. The lakes were created during the late 18th and mid 19th centuries by\ndamming the narrow incised tidal creeks that the lake now fills. The Bosherston Lakes system is\ncomposed of four water bodies, the Upper and Lower Eastern Arms, the Central Arm and Western\nArm-Central Lake (Figure 1). The four water bodies are separated by stone-walled causeways or\ndams with sluices or weirs (Eight Arch Bridge, Grassy Bridge Dam and Central Arm Causeway),\nalthough hydraulic connection occurs between water bodies when water levels are sufficiently high,\ngenerally during the winter.\nThe lakes are covered by a Nature Reserve Agreement between the Countryside Council for Wales\n(the Welsh Assembly Government's wildlife conservation authority for Wales) and the owners, the\nNational Trust (a conservation charity). Although the Countryside Council for Wales is responsible\nfor the ecological management of the lakes and their achievement of favourable condition under the\nHabitats Directive, the Environment Agency (the national environmental regulator) is responsible\nfor the wider water quality and water resources of the catchment.\n2.2 The catchment\n5The catchment is generally low lying with all land below 100 m above sea level (masl) (Figure 2a).\nThe higher land in the north of the catchment, at an elevation of around 30-90 masl, is mostly\nformed of Devonian age Milford Haven Group (Fig. 2b), which comprises mudstones, siltstones\nand thin, fine grained sandstones (although there are also subsidiary bands of Carboniferous Lower\nLimestone Shales and Devonian Skrinkle Sandstone)., The primary porosity of the sandstones are\nlow, with the predominant groundwater flow via fractures. The permeability is limited due in part to\nthe variety of lithologies, with low permeability mudstones, marls and siltstones interbedded with\nthe sandstones (Morris et al., 2000).\nThe Carboniferous Limestone (Figure 2b), which is the main aquifer in the area, forms a distinctive\ncoastal plateau of low relief (of around 20-40 masl) in which lie the Bosherston Lakes (Howells,\n2006). The Carboniferous Limestone exhibits \u2018karstic\u2019 hydrogeological behaviour by virtue of a\ncombination of high rock solubility and well developed secondary or fracture porosity (Allen et al.,\n1997). Groundwater flow largely occurs with the localised solutionally-enlarged conduits which\nprovide low resistance pathways for ground water flow and which often short circuit the granular or\nfracture permeability of the aquifer. Despite the limestone aquifer outcrop continuing beyond the\ncoastline, there is no evidence of significant saline intrusion into the limestone aquifer, although this\nmay partly relate to the paucity of observation boreholes near to the coast. However, a farm located\naround 400 m from the coast reportedly had to sink 3 boreholes as the first two were saline, but\nunfortunately the groundwater level and the depths to which the saline boreholes were drilled are\nunknown. The only hydrogeological study of south Pembrokeshire was carried out in the 1970s\n(Howard Humphrey and Sons, 1978) and was able to make only limited comments on the limestone\naquifer properties of the area because of the lack of hydrogeological data.\nThe stream network in the catchment is largely restricted to the northern parts overlying the Milford\nHaven Group, where the Merrion and Stackpole Streams eventually discharge into the lakes (Fig.\n61). In the limestone areas surface waters infiltrate into the dry streambeds or into small sinkholes\nsuch that there are no surface water inflows into either the Western or Central Arms of the lake.\nThe soils are mainly permeable, well drained brown-earth soils, resulting from post-glacial\nweathering of extensive loess deposits, although Aeolian sand deposits are present near the coast\n(Rudeforth et al., 1984).\nThe climate of the area is in general mild and maritime, being influenced by the prevailing south-\nsouth westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean. Annual average rainfall for the period 1970-2006 at\nthe nearby Orielton weather station [51.654oN, -4.957oW], situated 1.5 km from the catchment\nborder (Figure 3), is 1120 mm. The moist climate of the region suits the growth of grass, and\nlivestock farms are the dominant feature of the landscape. Permanent or temporary grass covers\nalmost two thirds of the catchment (Figure 2c) to provide grazing and forage for beef, sheep and\nmilk production. Arable crops, mainly barley, form part of the rotation on many farms to provide\nfeed. Apart from the small villages of Bosherston and Stackpole, there is little other urban\ndevelopment.\nPrevious unpublished studies into the catchment and lake hydrology have been synthesised by\nHolman et al. (2009) to form the basis of a conceptual model of the system (Figure 4).\n[Figure 2 around here]\n[Figure 3 around here]\n[Figure 4 around here]\n3. The model\nThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model (Arnold et al. 1998) is a physically based,\ncontinuous, semi-distributed model which operates on a daily time step and is able to predict the\n7movement of water (and sediment and agricultural chemicals) in complex watersheds with varying\nsoils, land use and management conditions over long periods of time. It includes surface run-off,\nreturn flow, percolation, crop growth, irrigation, groundwater flow, and reach routing among other\nfeatures. Surface run-off is calculated by an improved SCS (Soil Conservation Service) Curve\nNumber approach (Arnold et al., 1998). The percolation component consists of a linear storage with\nup to ten layers, with the flow rate governed by the hydraulic conductivity and the available water\ncapacity of each layer. For lateral subsurface flow, a kinematic storage model is used. Percolation\nfrom the root zone recharges a shallow aquifer (Neitsch et al., 2005), which is also connected to\nstream flow. The model calculates evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants separately, as\ndescribed by Ritchie (1972). The actual evaporation is a function of soil water content, plant type\nand soil depth. Transpiration is computed as a linear function of potential plant evapotranspiration\nand leaf area index. Canopy storage for each crop is also included. SWAT also contains a plant\ngrowth model, which is a simplified version of the plant growth approach of the EPIC model\n(Williams et al., 1983). It is based on accumulating heat units, harvest index for the partitioning of\ngrain yield, the Monteith approach for potential biomass (Monteith, 1977) and water, nutrient and\ntemperature stress concepts. Tillage systems and agricultural management can be specified for each\ncrop.\nSWAT simulates two aquifer in each sub basin \u2013 a Shallow Aquifer and a Deep Aquifer. The\nShallow Aquifer is considered to be an unconfined aquifer that interacts with the main river in the\nsub-basin, whilst the Deep Aquifer is described as a confined aquifer which is assumed to\ncontribute to streamflow somewhere outside the watershed. Recharge to the Deep Aquifer is a\nspecified proportion of the total recharge on a given day. However, it is important to recognise that,\nalthough the Deep Aquifer is described as a confined aquifer in Neitsch et al. (2005), there is no\nphysical or mathematical representation of a deeper confined aquifer in the model, but it is rather a\nstore into which the proportion of recharge that enters can be considered as lost from the system.\n8Application of SWAT has been widely reported in European catchments, but has been little applied\nin karstic systems (e.g. see review by Gassman et al., 2007).\n3.1 Model set-up\nAutomatic catchment delineation using a 10 m resolution digital elevation model was used to define\nthe 2049 ha Bosherston Lakes catchment (Fig. 2d). In the absence of sufficient groundwater\nmonitoring boreholes, it was assumed that the surface water and groundwater catchments were\ncoincident. Although this is clearly a significant assumption with regard to a karstic limestone\naquifer (Goldscheider & Drew, 2007), there is a geological control to the northern boundary of the\nlimestone where it abuts the Milford Haven Group. Twenty subbasins were delineated after manual\nalterations to allow for the locations and separations of the water bodies within the lake system.\nDaily precipitation data were available for 1970 \u2013 2006 from the Orielton weather station, with data\nfrom Stackpole and Milford Haven (both within 10km) used to fill the few data gaps. Daily\nPotential Evapotranspiration (PET) data, based on the Penman-Monteith algorithm (Jensen et al.,\n1990), from 1975 from the European MARS (Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing,\nhttp:\/\/agrifish.jrc.it\/marsstat\/) system was used after a comparison with the values from the\nHargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) using minimum and maximum daily\ntemperature from the Orielton weather station showed little difference.\nSpatial soil data was provided by the Digital National Soil Map of England and Wales (NSRI,\n2001). Data on soil physical and chemical characteristics were derived from the Land Information\nSystem (http:\/\/www.landis.org.uk) and Rudeforth et al. (1984). Soil albedo was calculated using\nNRCS (1999) and soil erodibility factors were calculated using Williams (1995).\nSpatial land cover data came from the national Land Cover Map 2000. Within arable land cover\nclasses, rotations linked to soil types were based on Holman et al (2004), which agreed with the\ndata on individual crops areas within the catchment from national agricultural census data. Two\n9main crop rotations were used- silage-silage-silage-winter wheat-winter barley-maize, and hay-hay-\nhay-winter wheat-spring barley-potato rotations. Improved grassland was assigned silage (single\ncut) and grazing based on local practice; whilst the remaining unimproved grassland was assumed\nto be grazed by sheep. The livestock types and numbers from the census data were also used to\ncalculate livestock composition and densities within the catchment. Vegetation and livestock\nparameters were defined based on Whitehead (2006), Hough (1990), Agro Business Consultants\n(2007), Frame (2000), Holman et al (2004) and Manske (2004). Grassland and arable crops were\nfertilised according to the recommendations in DEFRA (2000), assuming average nutrient supply\nstatus in the soils.\nThere are two main groundwater abstractions in the catchment providing water for an army camp\nand a livestock farm. Gillard (2007) estimated the annual average abstraction for the farm at around\n146,000 m3\/a based upon number of cattle and their typical consumption by season. Annual\nabstraction from the army camp is around 176,000 m3\/a, based upon measured monthly abstraction\ndata for 2005.\nEach of the 4 water bodies comprising the lakes were set-up within SWAT as reservoirs and\nparameterised according to the SWAT target release approach (Neitsch et al., 2005). Using this\noption the water bodies release water as a function of the desired target storage (based on overflow\nlevels of the weirs), and the number of days to reach a target storage, which permits the\nrepresentation of the differing flushing rates\/residence times of the water bodies. Using available\nbathymetric data (Holman et al., 2007), the volume at the principal spillway of the Upper Eastern\nArm was calculated as 76000 m3; for Lower Eastern Arm of 139000 m3; Central Arm of 47000 m3;\nand Western Arm-Central Lake of 172000 m3.\n3.2 Calibration \/ validation data\nThere are limited hydrological data available in the catchment, with the main source of data being\nperiodic (7 to 10 day interval) manual measurements of the lake water levels (to the nearest\n10\ncentimetre) at between 3 and 6 staff gauges since July 1977 (Fig. 3). Monthly average discharge\ndata for the Merrion and Stackpole streams were available for October 1983 to August 1985, while\nRees and Hinton (1989) provides occasional spot measurements of the lake outflow to the sea in\n1984 and 1985 and the water levels required for the hydraulic connections of the various lake arms.\nDaily groundwater levels have also recorded (to the nearest centimetre) by the Environment Agency\n(the national environmental regulator) at four monitoring boreholes in the catchment since 1997.\n4 Model calibration and validation\n4.1 Calibration\nThe temporally variable and limited observational data were used within a two-step calibration\nprocess, with the simulated surface water inflows (Figure 5) and groundwater levels (Figure 6)\ncalibrated first, followed by the lake volumes. A sensitivity analysis in the Bosherston catchment\nshows that the simulated stream discharges were particularly sensitive to Curve Number (CN),\nAPLHA_BF, RCHRG_DP and GW_REVAP, consistent with other studies (e.g. Neitsch et. al.,\n2001). Using the 23 months of monthly average stream discharges in 1983-1985, the calibration of\nsimulated streamflow was carried out for the upper portion of the catchment, crossed by the\nMerrion and Stackpole Streams. The modelled shallow aquifer storage values were calibrated\nagainst observed borehole data for the period 1997-2005, (Figure 6). In order to provide good\nvolumetric and temporal representation of the stream flows, the calibration resulted in low Curve\nNumbers - around 45 for the subbasins of the Merrion Stream, which straddle the sandstone and the\nlimestone, and around 55 in the Stackpole Stream subcatchment on the sandstone. Other calibration\nparameters were:\n\uf0b7 \uf061GW, baseflow recession constant, was decreased to 0.020 days to improve the fit of the\nrecession limbs of the stream hydrographs;\n11\n\uf0b7 RCHRG_DP, the Deep Aquifer percolation fraction which defines the proportion of total\ndaily recharge routed to the Deep Aquifer was increased to 0.55 on the northern Limestone\nsubbasins to satisfactorily fit the hydrographs;\n\uf0b7 GW_REVAP, which controls the proportion of water which will move from the shallow\naquifer to the root zone as a result of soil moisture depletion was increased to 0.20 to\naccount for the important loss of water from the shallow aquifer to overlying the soil layers,\nparticularly within the significant areas of wet woodland.\n[Figure 5 around here]\n[Figure 6 around here]\nAfter completing the initial calibration of the streamflow discharges into the lake system (Fig. 5),\nthe lake levels were calibrated (Figure 7). The calibration of the lake levels is challenging because\nof the \u2018buffering effect\u2019 that the lakes provide to the peaks in stream and groundwater spring\ndischarge. For the calibration of the model against lake levels, the period 1995-2005 was used as\nthe lake level data were most frequent during this period. The number of days to reach target\nstorage were calibrated to 2 days for the Upper Eastern Arm, 4 for the Lower Eastern Arm, 5 for\nCentral Arm and 4 for Western Arm and Central Lake, which was consistent with observed water\nlevel records. Certain sub-catchments discharge directly into the Western and Central Arm of the\nlakes through the calcium-rich groundwater springs with no evident surface hydrography \u2013 in these\nsub-catchments the CN was calibrated to a CN value of 60. The remainder of the catchment\nconserved the original CN2 values as given in Neitsch et al. (2005).\nWhilst the bed of the Upper Eastern Arm appears impermeable due to a thick clay layer (Holman et\nal., 2007), there is the potential for significant losses of water through the lake beds of the other\nArms due to the thin or negligible sediment cover above the limestone. Such losses of water enter\n12\nthe shallow aquifer and are likely to flow to discharge at sea. The lake levels for the Central Lake-\nWestern Arm, Lower Eastern Arm and Central Arm seepages were calibrated with RES_K\n(effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir bottom) values of 4.0, 1.5 and 1.0 mm\/h.\nFollowing calibration, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for the simulated lake levels were\n0.67 for the Upper Eastern Arm, 0.67 for the Lower Eastern Arm, 0.74 for the Central Arm and 0.71\nfor the Western Arm-Central Lake (Fig. 7). Values of 0.5-0.65 are described as \u2018Good\u2019 by\nHenriksen et al. (2003) and 0.65-0.85 as \u2018Very Good\u2019.\nIn addition to the calibration of hydrological variables, the simulated annual crop biomass of the\nprincipal crops (barley, wheat, maize, potatoes, grass) were satisfactory in comparison to values in\nHough (1990). Good crop growth representation is essential for good reproduction of\nevapotranspiration processes and water balances.\n[Figure 7 around here]\n4.2 Validation results\nThe validation period for lake levels covered the earlier years of 1984-1994. The resultant Nash-\nSutcliffe coefficient values for the lake levels were 0.56 for the Upper Eastern Arm, 0.74 for Lower\nEastern Arm; 0.57 for Central Arm; 0.64 for Western Arm-Central Lake (Fig. 7). According to\nHenriksen et al. (2003), the model performance is Good or Very Good for all of the water bodies.\nAs a final qualitative element of the validation, the simulated outflows from the Central Lake to the\nsea were compared with the available spot (or instantaneous) measurements (Figure 8), which\nshowed a reasonable match in flow rate and timing (given the important differences in temporal\nscale) demonstrating that this simulated flux is not unreasonable.\n13\n[Figure 8 around here]\n5. Discussion\nPrior to this study, the quantified understanding of the hydrology and hydrogeology of the\nBosherston Lakes system was poor, due in part to the limited hydrological data which was available\nfor different time periods and with different temporal scales (ranging from instantaneous to monthly\naverages). However, the diverse nature of the limited data which are available, describing stream\ndischarges, lake levels, periods of hydraulic connection between the lake arms, groundwater levels\nand lake outflows has allowed the construction of a plausible calibrated and validated SWAT model\nof the system.\nThere have been a limited number of previous applications of the SWAT model in karst systems.\nBenham et al. (2006) reported that SWAT streamflow results did not meet calibration criteria for a\nwatershed in southwest Missouri, but that visual inspection of the simulated and observed\nhydrographs indicated that the system was satisfactorily modeled. They suggest that SWAT was not\nable to capture the conditions of a very dry year in combination with flows sustained by the karst\nfeatures. In contrast, Afinowicz et al. (2005) had to modify SWAT to more realistically simulate\nrapid movement of recharge through the shallow aquifer to deep aquifer storage in southwest Texas\nto allow simulated base flows to matched measured streamflows. Spruill et al. (2000) stress the\nimportance of lowering the curve number (CN2) values to account for higher infiltration into karstic\nterrains; whilst Barfield et al. (2004) corrected the time of concentration to account for the flow\nthrough the epikarst and attenuated the peaks of discharge, as karstic terrains show a different\nresponse in terms of runoff.\nThe karstic nature of the limestone aquifer influences the overlying streams and tributaries, as the\nstream flows are reduced by exfiltration through the stream beds, with surface runoff reduced more\n14\nthan would be expected on similar catchments which do not overlie karstic rocks (White, 2002).\nExfiltration into sinkholes of flow in the upper reaches of the Merrion stream was observed by\nMiller (2007), which is consistent with the calculations of discharge \/ catchment rainfall ratio (for\n1983-85) which showed that 60-73% of the rainfall appears as runoff in the sandstone catchment of\nthe Stackpole Stream compared to only 36-45% in the Merrion Stream catchment which partly\noverlies the limestone (Rees and Hinton 1989). In calibrating the streamflows within the\nBosherston catchment, very low Curve Numbers were required, particularly in the Merrion Stream\nsubcatchment. The values were significantly lower than the default values given in Conservation\nEngineering Division (1986), consistent with Spruill et al. (2000).\nThe SWAT model outputs have enabled a comprehensive water budget for the system to be\ndeveloped for the first time (Figure 9). The precipitation inputs to the system have been partitioned\ninto different outflows (actual ET, coastal groundwater discharge, lake evaporation, abstraction and\nlake outflow to the sea) or stores (lake, soil water and groundwater). Prior to this study,\ngroundwater abstraction was thought to impact on water levels. Although the water budget shows\nthat groundwater abstraction and lake evaporation have little effect on the overall catchment water\nbalance (which is dominated by actual ET, groundwater flow to the sea and the overflow from the\nlake to the sea when the lake levels are above the critical height of the overflow sluice), impacts on\nlake levels of new or increased abstractions, particularly under the drier conditions predicted with\nclimate change cannot be ruled out.\n[Figure 9 around here]\nGiven that the Bosherston Lakes lie above the highly permeable and karstic Carboniferous\nlimestone, the importance of the coastal groundwater discharge to the water balance is not\ncompletely surprising, but the degree of hydraulic connection between the lake and groundwater\n15\nflow system was poorly understood. The calibration and validation of the fluxes into and out of the\ndifferent water bodies has made it possible to confirm the parts of the lake system where seepage\nthrough the lake bottom is present (Lower Eastern Arm, Central Arm and Western Arm \/ Central\nLake) and others where there is no seepage or it is negligible at the scale of the investigation (Upper\nEastern Arm). Given that the lake water levels in the model could not be calibrated against\nobserved levels without the inclusion of seepage through the lake beds, it is confirmed that there is a\nconnectivity between the lake and aquifer in the Western and Central Arms where only\nunconsolidated lake sediments overly the aquifer and allow the egress of lake water into the aquifer.\nThe good simulation of lake levels suggests that the model assumption that lake leakage is\nproportional to lake levels, having a winter maximum associated with high water levels and a\nsummer minimum, is realistic. However, it is not possible to ascertain whether the leakage is being\nentirely driven by head differences or whether there are fissures at different elevations in the lake\nsides which are contributing to differential leakage (Miller, 2007).\nHowever, the validated model suggests that much of the coastal groundwater discharge is\ngroundwater that bypasses the lake system, rather than originating as leakage from the lakes.\nWithin the SWAT model, calibration of the baseflow component of the stream flows required that a\nspatially variable proportion of the groundwater recharge entered the Deep Aquifer (which has no\nconnection with the surface water network in the model, and so is lost from the system), rather than\nthe Shallow Aquifer (which can have a connection with the surface water network in the model).\nThe Carboniferous limestone is the principal aquifer in the area, so this \u2018loss\u2019 represents larger scale\ngroundwater flow paths within the Carboniferous Limestone which do not interact with the local\nsurface water systems but which discharge directly to sea, rather than a loss of groundwater to a\ndeeper aquifer in the Bosherston catchment. The recharge to the Deep Aquifer (in the Carboniferous\nlimestone areas) in the validated model show a decreasing pattern from the Northern part of the\nlimestone areas \u2013 where around 55% of recharge enters the Deep Aquifer, to the central catchment\n16\narea where about 25% enters, to the areas nearer to the sea where recharge to the Deep Aquifer is\nabout 0-10%. Of the 33% of the water balance outflows which constitute coastal groundwater\ndischarge, 46% is provided by this larger scale groundwater flow and 54% by leakage from the\nlakes. The model \u2013 by means of the specification of the groundwater \u2018losses\u2019 \u2013 has therefore\nprovided an estimate of the regional flow of water through the karst system out of the catchment to\nthe coast, where significant springs have been observed (Allen et al., 1997). In contrast to\nCarboniferous Limestone, there are no simulated losses to a Deep Aquifer in the northern Old Red\nSandstone areas, indicating that the surface waters are the main groundwater discharge zone for this\naquifer, consistent with the higher discharge \/ rainfall ratios calculated by Rees and Hinton (1989).\nHowever, despite the acceptable model performance, there is still considerable uncertainty in the\nestimation and apportionment of simulated coastal groundwater discharge due to lake seepage and\nregional groundwater flow. This arises due to the short period of surface water flows data against\nwhich the stream flows and the Deep Aquifer losses have been calibrated, and the limited number\nof spot observations of lake outflows which have been used to demonstrate the plausibility of the\nlake levels which partly result from the calibrated lake seepage. This uncertainty could be reduced\nby improved monitoring of the surface water inflows and lake outflow water balance components.\nWoodward et al. (1998) state that the CN procedure \u201cdoes not work well in karst topography areas\n\u2026.. because a large portion of the flow is subsurface rather than direct runoff\u201d. This would seem to\nbe partially contradicted by the good SWAT model performance in the Bosherston catchment\nsuggesting that the Curve Number concept can be satisfactorily used in such areas providing\nappropriate model calibration. In addition, the SWAT model gives a satisfactory description of the\ntransfer of all effective precipitation through the groundwater system in those karstic parts of the\ncatchment where the surface hydrography is absent. This is demonstrated by the correct simulation\nof the behaviour of water levels in the Central Arm, which is fed only by springs and is not\ninfluenced by either streams or the water levels in the other arms. The application of the SWAT\n17\nmodel to the Bosherston Lakes catchment and the interpretation of the calibrated model parameters\ngoverning the groundwater storage and the exchanges between groundwater and surface waters and\nthe model outputs has enabled new understandings of the system behaviour to be developed. The\nimproved quantitative understanding of the hydrological functioning of the lakes and the fluxes\nthrough both the surface and groundwater pathways will contribute to the development of a long\nterm management strategy of the site to better manage nutrient and sediment problems under\ncurrent and future climatic conditions. In addition the high degree of lake \u2013 groundwater interaction\nsupport the catchment implementation of a proposed Nitrate Vulnerable Zone to reduce\ngroundwater nitrate concentrations and the expected removal of groundwater abstraction licencing\nexemption. The study has also demonstrated the wider utility of SWAT in improving the\nunderstanding of hydrological understanding of karstic systems.\n6. Conclusions\nThe Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been applied to the Bosherston catchment in west\nWales, UK. This catchment contains the internationally important set of shallow linked marl lakes,\nthe Bosherston lakes, whose water levels are controlled by control structures, surfaces water inflows\nand lake-groundwater interactions. A two-step calibration process was performed, against the\nlimited stream flow data and groundwater levels and the lake levels. Good or very good\nperformance indices (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient ranging from 0.67-0.74 for the calibration period\nand from 0.56-0.74 during validation) were obtained for the lake levels, whilst annual crop biomass\nand lake overflow discharges to the sea were plausible.\nA water budget for the system, based on the model simulations, has been developed for the first\ntime. Prior to this study, groundwater abstraction was thought to be significant, but the water\nbudget shows that groundwater abstraction and lake evaporation have a minor effect on the water\n18\nbalance, which is dominated by actual ET, coastal groundwater discharge and the overflow from the\nlake to the sea when the lake levels are above the critical height of the overflow sluice. A high\ndegree of connectivity between the lake and aquifer in the three of the four water bodies is\nconfirmed by the model but, of the 33% of the water balance outflows which constitute coastal\ngroundwater discharge only around 54% originates as leakage from the lakes. The remaining 46%\nof the coastal groundwater discharge comes from larger scale groundwater flows which bypass the\nlakes.\nThe application of the SWAT model to the Bosherston Lakes catchment has enabled new\nunderstandings of the system to be developed and has provided an improved basis for the future\nhydrological management of the catchment and lakes. The high degree of lake \u2013 groundwater\ninteraction support implementation of a proposed Nitrate Vulnerable Zone to reduce groundwater\nnitrate concentrations and the expected removal of groundwater abstraction licencing exemption.\nHowever, the lakes face many challenges from climate change and associated sea level rise which\nneed to be incorporated within an adaptive management strategy for lakes (Holman et al., 2009)\nThe study has also demonstrated the wider utility of SWAT in improving the understanding of\nhydrological understanding of karstic systems.\n7.
