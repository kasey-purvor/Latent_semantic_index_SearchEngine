Multiple abiotic variables were represented by six metrics: 4 \nelevation, distance to major tidal channels and to the nearest channel of any size, edaphic 5 \nconditions during dry and wet circumstances, and the magnitude of tidally-induced changes in 6 \nsoil saturation and salinity. A new approach, quantitative differential electromagnetic induction 7 \n(Q-DEMI), was developed to obtain the last metric. The approach takes the difference in soil 8 \ninduction from dry to wet conditions and converts that information to quantitative maps of 9 \ntidally-induced changes in root zone soil water content and salinity. The result is a spatially 10 \nexhaustive map of edaphic changes throughout the ecosystem. Spatially-distributed data on the 11 \nsix metrics were used to explore two hypotheses. 1) Multiple abiotic variables relevant to 12 \nvegetation zonation each exhibit different, uncorrelated, spatial patterns throughout an intertidal 13 \nsalt marsh ecosystem. 2) Vegetation zones and habitats of individual plant species are uniquely 14 \ncharacterized by different combinations of key metrics. The first hypothesis was supported by 15 \nobserved, uncorrelated spatial variability in the metrics. The second hypothesis was supported by 16 \nbinary logistic regression models that identified key vegetation zone and species habitat 17 \ncharacteristics from among the six metrics. Based on results from 108 models, the Q-DEMI map 18 \nof saturation and salinity change was the most useful metric for distinguishing different 19 \nvegetation zones and species habitats in the salt marsh.  20 \n 21 \nKEYWORDS 22 \npattern, salt marsh, vegetation, zonation, edaphic, wetland, geophysics, ECa, Q-DEMI23 \nPage 2 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION  1 \nThe segregation of a few dominant plant species into distinctive zones is characteristic of 2 \nintertidal salt marshes. Each zone comprises a distinctive macrophyte assemblage and may also 3 \nuniquely sustain other species of concern. For example, stands of native Spartina foliosa densely 4 \ndissected by tidal channels San Francisco Bay support endangered Rallus longirostris obsoletus 5 \n(California Clapper Rails), but endangered Reithrodontomys raviventris (Salt Marsh Harvest 6 \nMice) favor largely monospecific and undissected Salicornia virginica flats (USFW 2008). The 7 \nnature and causes of this ecologically important vegetation zonation have been studied for 8 \ndecades with gradient analyses and paired plot, mesocsosm, or transplant studies. Such studies 9 \nhave determined that the causes of salt marsh vegetation zonation are both physical, determined 10 \nin part by variability in soil (edaphic) and tidal conditions (Pennings and others 2005), and 11 \nbiological, the result of interspecific resource competition and biological response to periodic 12 \ndisturbance (Bertness and others 1992; Emery and others 2001; Pennings and Callaway 1992), 13 \neven as the specific patterns and species vary regionally (Peterson and others 2008).  14 \nAt the ecosystem scale, it remains a challenge to explain salt marsh vegetation patterning 15 \ndespite knowledge of specific zonation mechanisms at the plant scale. Characterization of the 16 \nspatial variability of vegetation within salt marsh ecosystems has thus far relied heavily on 17 \nmetrics of relative landscape position such as elevation and distance to tidal channels; however, 18 \nthese geographic metrics, alone, have been insufficient predictors of salt-marsh vegetation zones 19 \n(Zedler and others 1999, Silvestri and others 2005). Although remote sensing has been used to 20 \nmap spatial patterns of tidal channels (e.g., Marani and others 2006) and marsh surface 21 \nelevations (e.g., Sadro and others 2007) in relation to salt marsh vegetation, such maps are highly 22 \nnonspecific, failing to distinguish unique and consistent salt marsh vegetation habitat 23 \nPage 3 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n2 \n \ncharacteristics. Probabilistic models based on geographic metrics (e.g., Sanderson and others, 24 \n2001) fare somewhat better, but the fraction of marsh vegetation cover predicted correctly is 25 \ngreatly skewed by very high or very low coverage by a given species. Part of the difficulty in 26 \nsuch analyses is that geographic metrics are only rough proxies for the combined effects of many 27 \nphysical, chemical, and biological variables that contribute to salt marsh zonation. 28 \nIn this study we explored two hypotheses about the spatial nature of multiple zonation-29 \nrelevant variables and their relationship to salt marsh vegetation distribution. First, we 30 \nhypothesized that different variables, such as tidal flood duration and direction, root zone soil 31 \nwater content, and soil salinity, may each exhibit different spatial patterns in a salt marsh. The 32 \npatterns of such variables may have different characteristic spatial scales and gradients oriented 33 \nin opposing directions. Second, each plant species or zone may correlate with different 34 \ncombinations of variables. For example, one species might grow among dry soil conditions or 35 \nhigh soil salinity, but not both; another species might not grow among dry or salty edaphic 36 \nconditions. Also, due to interspecific interactions, a zone dominated by one species may not be 37 \ncharacterized by the same variables as the total habitat range of the species. Prior to this study, 38 \nsuch concepts had not been tested in a spatially-distributed manner throughout a salt marsh; we 39 \ninvestigated these hypotheses on the basis of extensive data sets spanning the full range of 40 \nconditions within an intertidal salt marsh ecosystem. 41 \nWe examined the first hypothesis by comparing the spatial patterns of six zonation-42 \nrelevant metrics: elevation, distance to major tidal channels and to the nearest channel of any 43 \nsize, the soil saturation\/salinity state during dry and wet marsh conditions, and the difference in 44 \nthis edaphic state between conditions. The first three metrics are geographic measures of 45 \nlandscape position and proxies for hydrologic processes relevant to salt marsh vegetation 46 \nPage 4 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n3 \n \nzonation. Elevation is commonly employed to represent the effects of flood\/exposure duration 47 \nand surface water ponding. A location\u2019s distance to the nearest tidal channel represents the likely 48 \ndirection of tidal flooding and groundwater drainage and directional tidal energy effects (e.g., 49 \nsediment deposition). This study uniquely considered both distances to primary tidal channels, 50 \ntypically identified from aerial imagery, and distances to small (~0.1 \u2013 0.5 cm wide, rarely 51 \nmapped) surface drainage pathways hidden beneath the vegetation that we term microtributaries.  52 \nThe remaining three metrics reflected soil properties under different hydrologic 53 \nconditions (dry and wet marsh soils) and the magnitude of change between conditions. The soil 54 \nproperties considered, soil saturation, salinity, and texture, are known to contribute to salt marsh 55 \nzonation (Silvestri and others 2005) but previously could only be measured at points, prohibiting 56 \nextensive repeat sampling and marsh-wide analysis. Geophysical electromagnetic induction 57 \n(EMI) imaging of bulk apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) captures the combined state of 58 \nsoil saturation, salinity, and texture in one ECa number (Friedman 2005, Rhoades and others 59 \n1999) and can be surveyed quickly over a large area. EMI has been used to investigate patterns 60 \nin soil properties (e.g., Lesch and others 2005, Robinson and others 2009) but its potential to 61 \nprovide new insight into ecosystem patterning is only beginning to be explored (Stroh and others 62 \n2001, Robinson and others 2008). Prior to this study the method had not been tested in an 63 \nenvironment with as extremely high soil water, salt, and clay contents as in salt marshes. To 64 \nfurther the applicability of EMI to salt marsh vegetation analysis, we developed a method to 65 \nfilter out the effects of the soil clay content on the ECa data and leverage the information on 66 \nchanges in soil saturation and salinity from sequential EMI surveys. Our approach was to 67 \nsubtract the data from two EMI surveys (differential or time-lapse EMI; Lesch and others 2005, 68 \nRobinson and others 2009) and then convert the ECa difference values (\u2206ECa) to quantitative 69 \nPage 5 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n4 \n \nestimates of soil water content and salinity change using Archie\u2019s Law (Quantitative Differential 70 \nEMI, or Q-DEMI). Our Q-DEMI methodology quantified tidally-induced saturation and salinity 71 \nchanges in the salt marsh root zone and enabled assessment of their spatial relationship to 72 \nvegetation zonation throughout a marsh in unprecedented detail.  73 \nTo explore the second hypothesis, that each salt marsh plant species might bear a 74 \ndifferent relationship to a suite of relevant variables, we sought to isolate distinguishing 75 \ncharacteristics of each of the major vegetation zones and individual species habitats composing 76 \nthe salt marsh ecosystem. We used logistic regression modeling to assess the correlation between 77 \nvegetation patterns and the six geographic and edaphic metrics. The geophysical data on salt 78 \nmarsh edaphic conditions provided greater insight into the underlying abiotic characteristics of 79 \nthe vegetation patterns than was gained from the geographic metrics alone. In particular, spatial 80 \nvariability in tidally-induced changes in soil water content and salinity, reflected in the Q-DEMI 81 \n\u2206ECa metric, were the most effective means of distinguishing vegetation zones and habitats. 82 \nMultiple variables combine to support ecosystem structures, functions, habitat 83 \nheterogeneity, integrity, and supply of ecosystem services of salt marshes (Turner and Chapin 84 \n2005, Peterson and others 2008), but these variables are seldom analyzed in a spatially-85 \ndistributed manner. With this study we aimed to better understand how the effects of multiple 86 \nabiotic variables combine into something more than the sum of the parts, a spatially-variable 87 \nabiotic template upon which salt marsh vegetation patterns and biotic interactions are expressed. 88 \nA system-level perspective that integrates both abiotic and biotic variables may help inform the 89 \nmaintenance and restoration of coastal wetlands, a matter of increasing interest worldwide amid 90 \nconcerns of sea level rise, increased storm activity, and coastal development pressure (Peterson 91 \nand others 2008).  92 \nPage 6 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n5 \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 93 \nField Site and Hydrology 94 \nThe study site was a 0.9 ha intertidal salt marsh in southern San Francisco Bay, within the 95 \nPalo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve (37o27\u201954\u201d N, 122o6\u201958\u201d W). The geological and botanical 96 \nhistory of the surrounding Santa Clara Valley were described by Cooper (1926) and the geology 97 \nunderlying the Palo Alto Baylands by Hamlin (1983). The history and character of the marsh 98 \nwere similar to that described by Hinde (1954) for the adjacent marsh to the south. The 99 \nunderlying site stratigraphy consisted of 3-5 meters of fine estuarine mud, predominantly 100 \nmontmorillonite clay, overlying a saline aquifer system (Hamlin 1983).  101 \nVegetation Mapping 102 \nPlant species at the site were: Spartina foliosa, Salicornia virginica (S. depressa), 103 \nDistichlis spicata, Jaumea carnosa, Grindelia stricta, Frankenia salina, Salsola soda, and 104 \nAtriplex prostrata (see USDA (2009) for synonymous species names). The habitat occupied by 105 \neach species was mapped by: marking the boundaries of assemblages distinguished by the 106 \npresence\/absence of each of the species, digitizing these polygonal boundaries using streaming 107 \nGPS, and identifying the relative abundance of each species within each polygon. This method 108 \nwas similar to that of Zedler and others (1999) for San Diego Bay marshes, but with greater 109 \nemphasis on identifying the locations of assemblage boundaries. Surveys of species\u2019 percent 110 \ncover within 1-m2 quadrats verified assemblage composition at 69 locations. The 57\/134 111 \nassemblage polygons verified by one or more quadrats accounted for 81% of the marsh area.  112 \nVegetation zones were classified by the species of greatest (dominant) cover fraction in 113 \neach assemblage polygon. The quadrat surveys confirmed that this was a sufficient means of 114 \nidentifying vegetation zones since assemblage composition within each zone defined in this 115 \nPage 7 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n6 \n \nmanner was consistent. In addition to the spatial distribution of major vegetation zones, in this 116 \nstudy we were interested in the full range of conditions among which each plant species grew. 117 \nWe refer to a plant species\u2019 habitat as all the areas the species occupied regardless of cover 118 \ndensity. In our vegetation discrimination analysis we assessed the salient characteristics of zones 119 \nand species habitats separately and compared the results. 120 \nMapping Edaphic Conditions 121 \nA logical precursor to understanding salt marsh vegetation distribution is a three-122 \ndimensional description of root zone edaphic conditions throughout the ecosystem, but obtaining 123 \nspatially-extensive data on relevant physical and chemical soil properties has been intractable 124 \nwith point-sampling methods. The combination of heterogeneous soil water content, salinity, and 125 \nclay fraction was captured in this study by maps of bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa). The 126 \nECa data were obtained on two separate days by repeatedly traversing the field site carrying a 127 \nstreaming EMI instrument (DUALEM-1S, Dualem, Inc., Milton, ON, Canada) and GPS, logged 128 \nconcurrently. Sequential traverses were separated to account for the ~4 m2 EMI measurement 129 \nsupport area. We estimated the vertical soil interval represented by the ECa data was 0-0.40 m 130 \ndepth (see online supplement), approximately the depth of the salt marsh root zone. We post-131 \nprocessed ~5000 ECa measurements per survey (Robinson and others 2008) and corrected for 132 \neffects of soil temperature (Reedy and Scanlon 2003) to produce kriged ECa maps at 2-m 133 \nresolution. Successive measurements of ECa at test locations agreed to within 0.01 dS\/m, which 134 \nwe take to be the ECa uncertainty, though the EMI instrument accuracy was 0.001 dS\/m. 135 \nThe two EMI surveys were timed to capture different hydrologic conditions. The first 136 \nsurvey occurred just prior to the neap-spring tidal transition, when the marsh had not been 137 \nflooded in eight days (Nov. 19, 2007); we refer to these as data from \u201cdry\u201d marsh conditions. 138 \nPage 8 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n7 \n \nThe second survey was partially into the next spring tide cycle, immediately following a flood 139 \ntide (Dec. 7); we refer to these as data from \u201cwet\u201d marsh conditions. We use the terms \u201cdry\u201d and 140 \n\u201cwet\u201d as qualitatively convenient reminders of antecedent tidal conditions although both 141 \ncircumstances represent very moist soils (>80% saturation). Both survey times were near mid-142 \nday and no rain occurred while the marsh surface was exposed during the study period. 143 \nThe field site experiences mixed semi-diurnal tides and a semi-arid Mediterranean 144 \nclimate with winter precipitation (~39 cm\/yr). The marsh plain is above mean high water and is 145 \nflooded by the higher high tide on \u2154 - \u00be of days during each spring-neap cycle. To verify 146 \nambient hydrologic conditions, we monitored groundwater and tidal conditions at the site by 147 \nlogging pressure and temperature every 10 minutes at the bed of the two primary tidal channels 148 \nand in 43 wells and piezometers installed 0.5 to 1.0 m into the marsh substrate. We monitored 149 \nhydraulic heads in the root zone with 23 tensiometer pairs spanning 10-15 and 20-25 cm depths. 150 \nTensiometer data were collected manually during the geophysical surveys. 151 \nEmpirical relationships have shown ECa to increase with increasing soil clay content, 152 \nwater content (\u03b8), or solution electrical conductivity (ECw) (e.g., Rhoades and others, 1999), 153 \nthough not for as high values as occur in salt marshes. We conducted laboratory analyses to 154 \nestablish the specific relationships between ECa and salt marsh soil properties. Twenty-three soil 155 \nsampling locations were strategically chosen using the ECa data from the first survey and 156 \nresponse-surface directed sampling (Corwin and Lesch 2005, Lesch 2005). After collecting ECa 157 \ndata at each location, soil cores (2.5 cm diameter) were collected manually from 0-30cm and 30-158 \n60cm depth. The 0-30 cm depth interval was chosen to correspond roughly to the EMI signal 159 \ndepth, enabling correlation with ECa survey data. The 30-60 cm deep samples were used in 160 \nparameterizing the Q-DEMI methodology, discussed below. The cores were immediately sealed 161 \nPage 9 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n8 \n \nin plastic bags and promptly weighed in the laboratory. Samples were air-dried for 11-28 days, 162 \nhomogenized subsamples weighed, oven-dried at 105oC for at least 12 hours and re-weighed, 163 \nand core water fractions and bulk densities calculated. Duplicate homogenized subsamples were 164 \nanalyzed for soil paste extract electrical conductivity (ECe) and soil texture (University of Idaho 165 \nPedology Laboratory standard procedures). Pore water samples extracted adjacent to the coring 166 \nlocations from 30 cm depth using a suction lysimeter (\u201csipper\u201d, ~\u22645 kPa suction) were analyzed 167 \nin the laboratory for pore water electrical conductivity (ECw).  168 \nQuantitative Differential EMI Methodology 169 \nEach geophysical survey provided a snapshot of the combination of water, salt, and clay 170 \nconditions throughout the salt marsh at one point in time. We developed a method to transform 171 \nthe difference in ECa between dry and wet tidal conditions into spatially-distributed, quantitative 172 \nestimates of changes in root zone soil water content and salinity. The premise of the Q-DEMI 173 \nmethod was that a change in the ECa value of a location was due to changing soil water content 174 \nand salinity while clay content remained constant. In our Q-DEMI analysis, we subtracted the 175 \nlater \u201cwet\u201d ECa data from the earlier \u201cdry\u201d ECa data, simulating a case of increasing soil 176 \nmoisture (\u2206ECa = ECadry \u2013 ECawet). We then determined the nature of the edaphic change, 177 \nwhether caused by changing soil water content or by changing soil salinity, from the sign of 178 \n\u2206ECa. An observed increase in ECa between dry and wet conditions (-\u2206ECa) indicated an 179 \nincrease in soil water content: an increase in salt content could not explain the change in these 180 \nareas because tidal waters were known a priori to be less saline (33.4 dS\/m) than the marsh pore 181 \nwaters (ECw \u2248 57.2 dS\/m) to which they were added in order to wet-up the marsh. In contrast, 182 \nan observed decrease in ECa (+\u2206ECa) indicated a decrease in pore water salinity: under 183 \nconditions of increasing tidal water availability, water content would remain constant or increase 184 \nPage 10 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n9 \n \nand so could not explain the ECa change in these areas. Because saturation and salinity changes 185 \ncould occur simultaneously with opposing effects, the Q-DEMI calculations represent the 186 \nconservative case in which all ECa change is ascribed to the dominant process, identified by the 187 \nsign of \u2206ECa. 188 \nQuantifying saturation and salinity changes was accomplished using Archie\u2019s Law in our 189 \nQ-DEMI methodology. Archie\u2019s Law is a well-studied geophysical relationship between ECa 190 \nand: pore water conductivity (ECw), a formation factor (f) related to porosity, the soil saturation 191 \n(S), and the soil mineral surface conductivity due to adsorbed ionic charge (\u03c3s) (Kirsch 2006).  192 \nsSfECwECa \u03c3+\u22c5\u22c5= 2          (Eqn. 1) 193 \nThe mineral surface conductivity (\u03c3s) is important in soils with large clay fractions, such as in 194 \nour salt marsh, but has not been tabulated for salt marsh clay soils. We estimated f and \u03c3s using a 195 \nsimple linear regression between ECa and pore water conductivity (ECw) for saturated samples 196 \n(S = 1). The samples used for this regression were from 30-60 cm depth since these samples were 197 \nknown to be from the saturated zone below the water table. The resulting f and \u03c3s parameter 198 \nestimates compared favorably with estimates from more complicated methods (see online 199 \nsupplement). These parameters permitted Q-DEMI calculation of changes in saturation, due to 200 \naerated pore space being filled by tidal waters, and changes in salinity, due to flushing of salt 201 \nmarsh soils, using variations on Archie\u2019s Law. 202 \nIn the saturation-change dominated (-\u2206ECa) areas of the marsh we solved Archie\u2019s Law 203 \n(Eqn. 1) for the net soil water content change required to account for the observed increase in 204 \nECa between dry and wet marsh conditions. To reduce one excess degree of freedom in the 205 \ncalculation we assumed that initially aerated pore space in the soil was completely filled by the 206 \nflood tide, leading to a minimum estimate of soil saturation change since the effect of any 207 \nPage 11 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n10 \n \ntrapped air would have reduced the magnitude of \u2206ECa. The formula we derived to calculate 208 \nsaturation change (\u2206S) is shown below (Eqn. 2). The parameters are the: formation factor (f ), 209 \nmineral surface conductivity (\u03c3s), tidal flood water electrical conductivity (ECtide), and ECa 210 \nduring wet (ECawet) and dry (ECadry) conditions. 211 \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )tide\ndrywettidetidewetstidewets\nECf\nECaECaECfECfECaECfECa\nS\n\u22c5\u22c5\n\u2212\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2212\u22c5\u2212\u2212\u2212\u22c5\u2212\u2212\u2212\n=\u2206\n2\n42\u03c3\u03c3\n (Eqn. 2) 212 \nThe real solution to Eqn. 2 using a positive discriminant root yielded unrealistic \u2206S values 213 \ngreater-than one, so was discarded.  214 \nIn the salinity-change dominated (+\u2206ECa) areas of the marsh we solved Archie\u2019s Law 215 \n(Eqn. 1) for the pore water electrical conductivity (ECw) under dry and wet marsh conditions. 216 \nWe then used the seawater equation of state to convert each ECw value to a salinity value. 217 \nSubtracting the salinity values yielded the change in salinity required to account for the observed 218 \ndecrease in ECa between dry and wet marsh conditions. To reduce one excess degree of freedom 219 \nin the calculation we assumed that these areas of the marsh remained water-saturated, leading to 220 \na minimum estimate of salinity change since the effect of any concurrent increase in soil water 221 \ncontent would have reduced the magnitude of \u2206ECa. (Field observations suggested that these 222 \nareas of the marsh did remain saturated throughout dry and wet marsh conditions.) 223 \nIn addition to the two maps of ECa, from dry and wet marsh conditions, the map of 224 \nsaturation and salinity changes produced by the Q-DEMI methodology provided a third spatially-225 \ndistributed metric of salt marsh root zone characteristics against which to compare salt marsh 226 \nvegetation zonation. 227 \nMapping Marsh Geometry 228 \nGeometric measures of spatial context within the ecosystem have traditionally been 229 \nemployed as indicators of salt marsh ecosystem structure and spatially-variable intertidal 230 \nPage 12 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n11 \n \nhydrologic effects. The most common such geographic, or \u201clandscape position\u201d (Zedler and 231 \nothers 1999), metrics are elevation and distance-to-channel. We mapped these metrics at the 232 \nsame high resolution as our edaphic data sets. We represented marsh plain topography by a 2-m 233 \nhorizontal resolution kriged map of 742 marsh plain surface elevations surveyed using a total 234 \nstation, verified against LIDAR data. Major tidal channels are typically identified from aerial 235 \nimagery, but we could find no precedent for mapping the small, connected surficial drainage 236 \npathways hidden under the vegetation canopy (\u201cmicrotributaries\u201d). We identified the banks of 237 \nmajor tidal channels and microtributaries by traversing them with a streaming GPS (20-cm post-238 \nprocessed horizontal accuracy). Two distance-to-channel metrics were calculated as the shortest 239 \nstraight-line distances from the center of each elevation grid cell to: 1) the nearest of the two 240 \nprimary tidal channels (bounding and bisecting the study area, Figure 1); 2) the nearest channel 241 \nof any size.  242 \nStatistical Vegetation Differentiation 243 \nTo contrast the utility of the six metrics described above in differentiating vegetation 244 \nzones and plant species habitats, we employed binary logistic regression (BLR) models (SPSS 245 \n2009). A logistic regression is analogous to a linear regression but with a categorical, instead of 246 \ncontinuous, dependent variable. By comparing the vegetation at each location in the marsh to the 247 \ncollocated values of the six metrics and repeating this for all marsh locations, the BLR method 248 \nbuilt models of those combinations of the six metrics that best distinguished the selected 249 \nvegetation zone or habitat type. BLR models were assessed at the 95% confidence level. 250 \nWe tested 108 BLR models, including univariate and multivariate analyses for each 251 \nvegetation zone and species habitat. In the univariate cases we assessed whether any of the six 252 \nmetrics, alone, could correctly differentiate the marsh areas inside and outside each of the six 253 \nPage 13 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n12 \n \nmajor vegetation zones (6 metrics x 6 zones = 36 zone models). We also tested whether any of 254 \nthe six metrics, alone, could correctly differentiate the marsh areas occupied or not occupied by 255 \neach species, regardless of its cover density (6 metrics x 6 species = 36 habitat models). These 76 256 \nmodels served to test the univariate predictive capacity of each of the six metrics in relation to 257 \nvegetation patterning at our site. For these models, the two-fold null hypothesis in each case was 258 \neither 100% or 0% cover by the selected zone or species. 259 \nIn the multivariate analyses, we built forward-conditional BLR models for each 260 \nvegetation zone and species habitat. This approach tested whether a combination of multiple 261 \nmetrics could better identify the distinguishing characteristics of each zone and habitat than a 262 \nsingle metric. We tested three metric combinations: 1) the three geographic metrics, 2) the three 263 \nedaphic metrics, 3) all six metrics, for total of 36 multivariate models (3 combinations x (6 zones 264 \n+ 6 habitats) = 36 models). The forward-conditional BLR method selected only those metrics 265 \nthat significantly contributed to the zone or habitat prediction at the 95% confidence level. For 266 \nthese models, the two-fold null hypothesis in each case was either 100% or 0% cover by the 267 \nselected zone or species. The results of the BLR models revealed the key characteristics 268 \ndistinguishing each habitat envelope and zone at our site. 269 \nRESULTS 270 \nVegetation Patterns and Marsh Geometry 271 \nThe spatial distribution of vegetation zones at the site is shown in Figure 1a, with zones 272 \nlabeled by the genus of the dominant species. Quadrat surveys verified that species identified as 273 \nzone dominants occupied a majority (59% \u00b1 16%) of the zone\u2019s cover. Zones dominated by the 274 \nsucculent Salicornia (28% of total marsh area) and the grasses Spartina (19%) and Distichlis 275 \n(47%) were most prominent at the site, with smaller areas dominated by Jaumea (4%), 276 \nPage 14 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n13 \n \nFrankenia (1%), and Grindelia (2%). Salsola and Atriplex individuals were present in only a few 277 \nlocations. The thick black outlines in Figure 1a highlight the three major vegetation zones, 278 \ndominated by Spartina, Distichlis, and Salicornia. Zone assemblage compositions are illustrated 279 \nby maps of relative cover density for each species (see appendix Figure A1), which were used to 280 \nassess the total habitat occupied by each species.  281 \nThe elevation ranges (\u00b5 \u00b1 1\u03c3 m above mean sea level) spanned by the species were not 282 \ndistinct: Distichlis, 1.04 \u00b1 0.04; Salicornia, 1.03 \u00b1 0.05; Spartina, 1.00 \u00b1 0.06; Jaumea, 1.03 \u00b1 283 \n0.05; Frankenia, 1.03 \u00b1 0.03; Grindelia, 1.04 \u00b1 0.03. Overlap between the elevation ranges of 284 \nkey species is common in salt marshes despite their characteristically distinct vegetation zonation 285 \n(Silvestri and others 2005, Sadro and others 2007). The average marsh plain elevation from the 286 \nkriged topographic data was 1.02 \u00b1 0.06 m above mean sea level (m aMSL) and ranged from 287 \n0.61 to 1.32 m. The seeming visual correlation between areas of slightly lower elevation and the 288 \nsouthern, Spartina-dominated zone (Figure 1b) was not statistically supported because those 289 \nsame elevations elsewhere in the marsh were dominated by different species. Employed in 290 \nunivariate BLR models, elevation failed to justify rejecting the null hypothesis for any of the 291 \nvegetation zones or species habitats at our site. 292 \nQualitative assessment of marsh locations\u2019 distance to primary tidal channels showed the 293 \nmajor zones dominated by Spartina, Distichlis, and Salicornia to each occur at any distance from 294 \nthe major tidal channels that bound and bisect the marsh (Figure 2a). The Spartina-dominated 295 \nzone appeared to coincide with a region of dense microtributaries (Figure 2b), yet neither 296 \ndistance-to-channel metric warranted rejecting the univariate BLR models\u2019 null hypothesis for 297 \nany of the vegetation zones or species habitats. 298 \nEdaphic Conditions and Vegetation 299 \nPage 15 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n14 \n \nThe spatial structure of edaphic conditions throughout the marsh, and the magnitude of 300 \nECa values reflecting these conditions, remained consistent between the dry (Figure 3a) and wet 301 \n(Figure 3b) surveys. Mean ECa values for the two surveys were 13.37 and 13.71 dS\/m, 302 \nrespectively (2.05 dS\/m standard deviations; correlation coefficient r = 0.83). Tensiometer data 303 \nconfirmed that the root zone was drier during the first, \u201cdry\u201d geophysical survey than during the 304 \nsecond, \u201cwet\u201d survey. Tides rapidly and uniformly covered the marsh to a depth of 0.5 m during 305 \nspring tide flooding events between the surveys. The specific relationships between ECa values 306 \nand edaphic conditions (soil solution and paste extract conductivities and water and clay 307 \ncontents) determined for this salt marsh are presented in the appendix. 308 \nThe configuration of vegetation zones (Figure 1a) did not resemble the spatial pattern of 309 \nedaphic conditions (Figure 3). Instead, interior marsh areas that exhibited persistent high soil 310 \nwater content and\/or salinity (high ECa) appeared coincident with major zone boundaries. A 311 \nphenomenon of stressful edaphic conditions and major zone boundaries occurring in the same 312 \nlocation was described for Spartina and Salicornia in northern San Francisco Bay salt marshes 313 \nby Mahall and Park (1976a) but had not been illustrated in two dimensions; our result is 314 \nconsistent with this explanation of ecotone locations. Though not consistently correlated with 315 \nany vegetation zone or elevation, the edaphic variability in the marsh was significantly related to 316 \nthe hydrologic processes represented by the distance-to-channel metrics (r = 0.36 to 0.54). Low 317 \nsoil saturation and\/or salinity (low ECa) occurred close to tidal channels and more stressful 318 \nedaphic conditions (high ECa) occurred further from the channels. Neither ECa data set provided 319 \ninformation sufficient to reject the null hypothesis of the univariate BLR models. 320 \nThe spatial pattern of tidally-induced changes in edaphic conditions revealed by 321 \nsubtracting the wet and dry ECa surveys (\u2206ECa, Figure 4a) was more heterogeneous than the 322 \nPage 16 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n15 \n \nspatial variability in static edaphic conditions (Figure 3). The pattern of change was not altered 323 \nby the Q-DEMI calculations, which converted \u2206ECa values to soil saturation and salinity change 324 \nquantities (Figure 4b). The conversion was made using values of f = 0.223 and \u03c3s = 2.479 dS\/m. 325 \nThe average estimated saturation change in the fluid-exchange dominated areas of the marsh 326 \n(blue in Figure 4b) was 6.2 \u00b1 5.5 % (\u00b5 \u00b1 1\u03c3). The average estimated salt loss from the salt-327 \nexchange dominated areas of the marsh (red in Figure 4b) was 0.77 \u00b1 0.64 kg\/m2. The large 328 \nstandard deviations of these average results were due to highly heterogeneous soil aeration and 329 \nflushing throughout the marsh. Despite the Q-DEMI methodology producing conservative 330 \nestimates of the magnitude of edaphic change, we emphasize that the methodology permits 331 \nmapping the magnitude of salt and water exchange in a spatially-distributed way throughout an 332 \necosystem for the first time. 333 \nSpatial patterns of saturation and salinity change did not qualitatively resemble 334 \nvegetation zonation (Figures 1a, 4b), yet BLR models based on \u2206ECa were able to partially 335 \ndescribe the zones dominated by every species except Distichlis. For the Salicornia-, Spartina-, 336 \nJaumea-, Frankenia-, and Grindelia-dominated zones, the BLR models correctly distinguished 337 \n22-44 % of the area inside each zone and 63-67% of the area outside each zone. Though short of 338 \nthe ideal prediction (100% correct both inside and outside each zone), these results using the 339 \n\u2206ECa metric were a substantial improvement over the null hypothesis returned by the models 340 \nbased on the other five metrics. 341 \n\u2206ECa BLR models were more successful at distinguishing between marsh areas occupied 342 \nand not occupied by each of the six plant species, regardless of cover density (appendix Figure 343 \nA1). \u2206ECa BLR habitat models correctly identified 64% of the observed Distichlis and 344 \nSalicornia occurrences and 37% and 44% of observed absences, respectively. \u2206ECa BLR 345 \nPage 17 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n16 \n \nmodels for Spartina and Jaumea habitat correctly predicted 70% and 73% of the observed 346 \noccurrences and 41% and 46% of observed absences, respectively. \u2206ECa BLR models for 347 \nFrankenia and Grindelia were less successful at correctly predicting occurrences of these species 348 \n(28% and 23%, respectively) but more successful at correctly predicting absences (63% and 349 \n60%, respectively). For all six species, the \u2206ECa BLR habitat models justified rejecting the null 350 \nhypotheses (95% confidence). 351 \nThe patterns in edaphic conditions and geographic metrics of salt marsh structure support 352 \nour two hypotheses regarding the spatial nature of zonation-relevant variables and their 353 \nrelationship to salt marsh vegetation distribution. 1) Multiple metrics relevant to salt marsh 354 \nvegetation zonation each exhibit different patterns. These patterns are characterized by different 355 \nspatial scales and degrees of spatial heterogeneity. 2) Alone, only the \u2206ECa metric provided 356 \ninformation useful in indentifying vegetation zones and species habitats. The relation of the 357 \n\u2206ECa metric to vegetation differed depending on the species considered and whether the species 358 \nwas considered alone or as a zone-dominant. 359 \nMultivariate Vegetation Zone and Habitat Discrimination  360 \nWe hypothesized that a combination of multiple metrics might better discriminate salt 361 \nmarsh vegetation zones and individual species habitats than univariate models. The metric 362 \ncombinations we tested using forward-conditional BLR models were: 1) the three geographic 363 \nmetrics, 2) the three edaphic metrics, and 3) all six metrics. Salient results are presented here; 364 \ncomplete BLR model results are provided in the online supplement. 365 \nExcept in the case of the Distichlis-dominated zone, none of the multivariate models 366 \nidentified vegetation zones or habitats significantly better than the univariate \u2206ECa BLR models. 367 \nFor the Distichlis-dominated zone, a BLR model including all three geographic metrics correctly 368 \nPage 18 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n17 \n \npredicted 45% of the marsh area within the zone and 72% of the area outside the zone, compared 369 \nto the null hypothesis returned by the univariate \u2206ECa BLR model. This result suggests that 370 \nDistichlis may be reliant on the hydrologic marsh processes implicit in the elevation and 371 \ndistance-to-channel metrics to maintain a dominant cover fraction. In contrast, the dominance of 372 \nthe other five major species at the site may be related to the magnitude of temporal variation in 373 \nroot zone soil water content and soil salinity, represented by the \u2206ECa metric. For example, 374 \n\u2206ECa was the only significant predictor of the marsh areas that Jaumea occupied, whether it was 375 \nthe dominant cover fraction or not, even when the other five metrics were made available to the 376 \nforward-conditional model. However, a BLR model based on \u2206ECa correctly predicted 73% of 377 \nJaumea occurrences in the salt marsh but only 32% of Jaumea-dominated zones. The difference 378 \nbetween the zone and habitat models suggest that the tidally-induced changes in root zone water 379 \nand salt content represented by the \u2206ECa metric may affect the growth and interspecific 380 \ninteractions of a species within a vegetation assemblage differently than the growth and survival 381 \nof individual plants of that species throughout the marsh. 382 \nDISCUSSION 383 \nVegetation Zonation 384 \nOur use of geophysical EMI technology was motivated by the inherent spatial limitations 385 \nof transect- and plot-based methods of investigating in situ salt marsh vegetation patterning. 386 \nLogistic regression models based on extensive two-dimensional data identified major 387 \ncharacteristics that distinguished the vegetation zones and species habitats at our site. The detail 388 \nof our regression models, based on over 2000 data points, makes it striking that some zones and 389 \nspecies habitats were uniquely identified by a combination of multiple variables (e.g., Distichlis) 390 \nbut others were best identified by a single variable (e.g., Jaumea). It is also significant that there 391 \nPage 19 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n18 \n \nwas a large difference in the ability of the models to describe the key characteristics of the total 392 \nhabitat envelope of a species versus the zone for which it provided the dominant cover class. 393 \nExisting theory suggests that the survival of individual salt marsh plants may be strongly affected 394 \nby environmental conditions but that the growth rate and relative cover of a species may be more 395 \nstrongly affected by interspecific interactions with its neighbors (e.g., Emery and others, 2001). 396 \nThis hypothesis seems to be supported by the greater success with which our regression models, 397 \nbased on metrics of abiotic ecosystem variability, were able to identify characteristic individual 398 \nspecies habitats compared to vegetation zones. 399 \nTide-induced Edaphic Change 400 \nThe most striking result of the vegetation discrimination analysis was the utility of the 401 \n\u2206ECa metric, alone, in identifying vegetation zones and species habitats. The Q-DEMI method 402 \nand soil core analyses showed that \u2206ECa represented the amount of water and salt exchanged 403 \nfrom the root zone (Figure 4b) between two points in time. The data from this study could not 404 \ndefinitively separate, however, whether observed changes in edaphic conditions were due 405 \nentirely to intervening tidal flooding, or due to a combination of physical and biological effects. 406 \nThe lack of correlation between \u2206ECa and either elevation or distance-to-channel argues against 407 \nthe hydrologic processes implied by the elevation and distance-to-channel metrics as the 408 \ndominant determinants of spatial patterns in edaphic change. 409 \nThe phenomenon of large, broadly distributed decreases in soil salinity, identified in this 410 \nstudy by decreases in ECa between dry and wet marsh conditions, has not previously been 411 \nreported and the precise cause is unknown. Potential mechanisms for what was apparently rapid 412 \nflood tide-induced salt removal from the salt marsh root zone include: diffusion, leaching, or 413 \ndissolution of salt from the surface; plant salt uptake; or dilution by convective mixing in soil 414 \nPage 20 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n19 \n \nmacropores. On average, the 0.77 kg\/m2 of salt loss from the salt-exchange dominated areas of 415 \nthe marsh constituted approximately 15% of the salt contained in the root zone pore water fluids. 416 \nWere dilution the only mechanism in operation, a salinity decrease of this magnitude would have 417 \nrequired approximately 70% of the root zone pore water to be replaced by the less salty tidal 418 \nwaters, on average across the marsh. Salt uptake by vegetation would reduce the amount of pore 419 \nwater turn-over required to match the geophysical observations.  420 \nPlant \u2013 Soil Interactions 421 \nQualitative comparison of tide-induced edaphic change and vegetation zonation (Figures 422 \n1a, 4b) suggests that the greatest density of areas experiencing large saturation increases due to 423 \ntidal flooding occurred in the Spartina-dominated zone, the greatest density of areas 424 \nexperiencing salt loss occurred in the Salicornia-dominated zone, and changes of intermediate 425 \nmagnitude prevailed in the Distichlis-dominated zone. We hypothesize that these spatial 426 \ncoincidences may be related to three different ecosystem engineering effects enabled by the 427 \ndifferent physiologies and morphologies of these three species.  428 \nFirst, enhanced sediment deposition within, and enhanced erosion around, Spartina 429 \nclusters has been reported at low marsh elevations (Temmerman and others 2007, van Hulzen 430 \nand others 2007). This mechanism may also explain the great density of microtributaries in the 431 \nSpartina-dominated zone (Figure 2) at our high-elevation marsh site. Because Spartina is more 432 \nproductive in low-salinity conditions than Salicornia and Distichlis (Bertness and others 1992, 433 \nMahall and Park 1976b), it may remain dominant precisely where surrounding microtributaries 434 \nenhance pore water drainage and flushing. This hypothesis is supported by experimental 435 \nmanipulations of marsh hydrology (Balling and Resh 1983, Wiegert and others 1983).  436 \nPage 21 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n20 \n \nSecond, Salicornia is one of the most salt-tolerant halophytes, producing more biomass 437 \nthan Spartina and Distichlis at high salinities and water contents, but less at low salinities 438 \n(Pearcy and Ustin 1984). We hypothesize that efficient root salt exclusion and water use by 439 \nSalicornia (Mahall and Park 1976b) may locally maintain a saturated and salty root zone, 440 \nenhancing Salicornia competitiveness.  441 \nThird, the matted morphology of Distichlis may decrease surface water velocities and so 442 \ninhibit erosion of microtributaries (and so Spartina-dominance) in areas of low salinity favorable 443 \nfor both grasses (Bertness and others 1992). Distichlis, like Salicornia, is quite effective at 444 \nexcluding ions at the root membrane (Marcum and others 2007), and so may persist in areas of 445 \nintermediate salinity, where it is often found nearly co-dominant with Salicornia at our site. A 446 \nlack of known disturbance at our study site in at least 30 years argues against disturbance as an 447 \nexplanation for the distribution of Distichlis at the site; furthermore, both Distichlis and 448 \nSalicornia are very effective at recovering from disturbance in northern California salt marshes, 449 \nneither necessarily competitively displacing the other (Allison, 1995). 450 \nCONCLUSION 451 \nThis study explored the spatial relationships between salt marsh vegetation patterns and 452 \nsix zonation-related metrics. The metrics were based on geographic and edaphic data: elevation, 453 \ndistance to major tidal channels and to the nearest channel of any size, the soil saturation\/salinity 454 \nstate during dry and wet marsh conditions, and the difference in this edaphic state between 455 \nconditions. The metrics, mapped at high resolution throughout a salt marsh ecosystem, exhibited 456 \nvery different spatial patterns. Among the six metrics, information on tide-induced edaphic 457 \nchange was most useful in discriminating salt marsh vegetation zones and individual species 458 \nhabitats. Unexpectedly poor spatial correlation between edaphic conditions and proxies for 459 \nPage 22 of 36Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n21 \n \nhydrologic forcing suggest, instead, the potential importance of plant-soil relations in spatial 460 \npatterns of tide-induced edaphic change.  461 \nThe results of this study supported two hypotheses relating the spatial patterns of salt 462 \nmarsh vegetation and abiotic variables. The hypotheses extend classic concepts of niche breadth 463 \nand overlap (Colwell and Futuyma 1971) into three spatial dimensions. First, the influence of 464 \neach resource used by, and stressor endured by, salt marsh vegetation may be spatially variable. 465 \nThese spatial patterns are combined implicitly in nature by superposition and may exhibit 466 \nemergent patterns and properties that are more than the sum of the contributing variables. 467 \nSecond, multiple contributing variables may affect the distribution of interacting species 468 \nassemblages differently than the distribution of individuals. Multivariate relationships between 469 \nabiotic and biotic ecosystem patterns are difficult to assess without high-resolution spatially-470 \ndistributed data at the ecosystem-scale. Geophysical methods such as EMI and Q-DEMI provide 471 \nmeans to obtain high-resolution, spatially-distributed data on root zone soil properties that have 472 \npreviously been prohibitively difficult to obtain. In this study, such edaphic data was more useful 473 \nin characterizing salt marsh vegetation zones and habitats than traditional geographic metrics 474 \nsuch as elevation and distance-to-channel. 475 \nThe challenge of predicting the vegetation distribution of intertidal salt marsh ecosystems 476 \npersists. Despite functional similarity between different salt marsh species around the world, 477 \nregional and latitudinal differences so far prohibit development of a universally-applicable, 478 \nmechanistic, zonation model (Farina and others, 2009; Pennings and others 2003). Even if such a 479 \nmodel were possible, its accuracy would necessarily vary from site to site. Some of the most 480 \npressing questions regarding salt marsh vegetation zonation, such as the expected response of a 481 \nmarsh to restoration efforts or to an invasive species, must be answered on a site-by-site basis 482 \nPage 23 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n22 \n \nand may require probabilistic, not deterministic, answers. Three-dimensional mapping, EMI 483 \ngeophysics, and the Q-DEMI methodology can provide a cost-effective, rapid, and repeatable 484 \nmeans to statistically characterize a salt marsh site. The resulting spatial and temporal patterns 485 \ncan then be used as a foundation upon which to interpret or predict vegetation distributions and 486 \nbiotic interactions based on existing region- and species-specific knowledge. Linking plot-scale 487 \nstudies of plant-soil relations and interspecific interactions to marsh-scale studies of spatial 488 \nvariability such as this one may provide the most promising means to fill the gap between the 489 \ngeneral principles and site-specific needs of salt marsh vegetation zonation science. 490 \nACKLOWLEDGMENTS 491 \nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation grant EAR-0634709 to Stanford 492 \nUniversity.

Variability in ECa values was 594 \nsignificantly related to variability in each of these edaphic properties (p < 0.005, Table A1). At 595 \nour site the EMI signal was dominated by the total salt content of the soil (as measured by the 596 \nsoil paste extract conductivity, ECe) but the soil water (\u03b8) and clay contents also contributed. The 597 \nclay content throughout the marsh was remarkably uniform and so did not figure significantly in 598 \nour analysis. See the online supplement for comparison of our salt marsh relationships with prior 599 \npublished relationships at lower water, salt, or clay contents. In brief, we conclude that the salt 600 \nmarsh ECa \u2013 ECe and ECa \u2013 \u03b8 relationships scale as in other environments but that the soil pore 601 \nsolution conductivity (ECw) and soil clay content of intertidal salt marshes have unique effects 602 \non EMI signals.  603 \nPage 29 of 36 Ecosystems\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSalt marsh spatial patterns and zonation  Moffett, Robinson, Gorelick \n    \n28 \n \nFIGURE AND TABLE CAPTIONS 604 \nFigure 1. a) Major vegetation zones, classified by the species of greatest cover fraction. b) Site 605 \ntopography, units: meters above mean sea level. 606 \nFigure 2. a) Shortest distance to one of the main tidal channels, shown in light blue bounding and 607 \nbisecting the marsh site. b) Shortest distance to the nearest channel of any size, 608 \nincluding microtributaries shown in dark blue. 609 \nFigure 3.
