In this \nstudy, the silver particles with diameter around 50 nm were produced by a simple wet chemistry \nmethod. Stable aqueous printable inks were formulated by using the combination of a triblock \ncopolymer and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Various factors that affect the ink \nstability, such as, copolymer content and time of HIFU treatment, were investigated. The ink \ncontaining 5 wt% silver has a viscosity of about 2 mPas and surface tension 30 mN\/m at 25 \n\u25e6\nC, \nwhich meet inkjet printer requirements. Such inks have been successfully printed on Al2O3 \nceramics and low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) and the printed films show low \nresistivity. \n1. Introduction  \nThere have been growing interest in the development of printed electronics in last few years \nbecause printed electronics offer alternatives to traditional silicon techniques and the potential \nfor low cost, large area electronics for flexible displays [1-2], sensors [3-4] and polymer MEMS \n[5-6]. Printed electronics with various functional inks containing nanomaterials such as metallic \nnanoparticles, organic electronics molecules\/polymers, carbon nanotubes, and ceramic \nnanoparticles have been expected to grow rapidly as a mass production process for new types of \nelectronic equipments. The printing of metal inks, especially those containing silver \nnanoparticles, has been found to be a very powerful tool for direct patterning of electrically \nconductive interconnects in electronic devices [7-9]. The particle-based inks require powders \nwith diameter less than 1\/100 the size of the nozzle diameter that is usually in a few or a few tens \nof micrometers, otherwise nozzle clogging would normally occur. Such a small size gives the \nparticles unique properties which  directly relate to their dimensions and to the fact that a large \nratio of the atoms in the particle is in the surface of the particle. One of the advantages coming \nfrom the nano-size of material is a dramatic reduction in melting point. Films printed using such \nsmall particles can be annealed at lower temperatures to form conductive films of low resistance, \nand be potentially suitable for use in printed electronics [10-12]. However, generally speaking, \nnanoparticles tend to cluster and agglomerate if they are not prevented to do so. Particle \nagglomeration causes the system to change to the one with fewer but larger particles. Hence, it is \nnecessary to modify the surface of the particles so that the agglomeration or clustering can be \ndelayed.  \nOne important aspect of inkjet printing technology is the physical properties of an ink, such \nas, viscosity and surface tension. Viscosity, to a certain extent, determines the formation of drops \nand in particular, the break-up and corresponding tail and surface tension is responsible for the \nspherical shape of the liquid drops emerging from a nozzle.  It is possible to jet a wide variety of \nfluids with viscosities in the range of 2-30 mPa s and surface tensions up to 60 mN\/m [13]. \nExcellent dispersion of metal particles in the ink with a low viscosity and high resistance to \nsedimentation is essential to achieve printable fluid and assure its performance. Due to \nagglomeration of particles, the viscosity tends to increase during storage. Hence it is important to \nperform the viscosity measurement with storage time to obtain some information regarding the \nagglomeration. The good stability of an ink should stop particles from settling for at least one \nweek at room temperature [13]. \nThere are a few commonly used dispersion methods such as ultrasounds or flow \nimpingement [13]. Different dispersants have been reported in literature to formulate stable Ag \ninks, for example, poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (PVP) [14] and polyelectrolytes [15]. Most used \nsolvents are toluene, alfa-terpineol [16-18]. However in the case of using organic solvents, it \nmay cause the environmental problem by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in realistic \nindustrial applications. In the case of using aqueous medium [19-22], polyelectrolytes, such as, \npoly(acrylic acid) sodium salt [19], showed to be good capping agents and dispersants for Ag ink \npreparation. Because the synthesized Ag nanoparticles are agglomerated or clustered together, \nthey must be separated into smaller particles for ink preparation. In many published work ball \nmilling was used to break up the agglomerates, although it is an effective way, the bead-\ncontamination of nanoparticle suspension might take place during milling process [23]. Bead \nbreakage results in fragments which can not be removed from the nanoaprticles suspension and \nhence will contaminate the fluid.  \nAnother way to formulate Ag inks is the use of metal\u2013organic complexes as precursors \n(MOD inks) [24-26].\n  \nHowever, the disadvantage of this method is its high light sensitivity and \nhigh decomposition temperature. \n \nIn this work, very stable, water-based Ag inks were prepared, which is suitable for printing \non ceramic substrates. The Ag nanoparticles prepared in our laboratory are strongly bound \ntogether through van der Waals force and therefore high energy is required in the dispersion \nprocess. High Intensity Frequency Ultrasound (HIFU), which has been used to breaking and de-\naggregating micro-sized particles into nano-sized ones and effectively forming nano suspensions \n[27], was used in this study to dispersing the Ag nanoparticles in water with the existence of \ndispersant Pluronic F127. As a \u201ctop-down\u201d technique, and in comparison with conventional \nultrasonic agitation and ball milling methods, HIFU introduces several novel aspects: (1) The \nhigh amplitudes (up to 10\n8\n Pa) and frequency (~10\n6\n Hz) mean that as a beam propagates, it \ndeforms, and can develop a \"shock\" wave front, i.e. the non-linear propagation effects; (2) Since \nthe frequency of ultrasound is increased from ~10\n4\n Hz to ~10\n6\n Hz, the threshold value of strong \nmicro scale transient cavitations are significantly increased. Therefore, the immense \ntemperatures and pressures and the extraordinary heating and cooling rates generated by \ncavitation bubble collapse could be alleviated. There\u2019s no distinct temperature increase at all \n[27]; (3) It avoids the possible contamination to the fluid due to bead breakage during ball \nmilling and the prolonged ball milling process. The process of ball milling to disperse Ag \nnanoparticles in water needs a few tens of hours, in some cases, even days, while HIFU process \nneeds only tens of minutes.  \nF127 is a triblock co-polymer consisting of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)\u2013poly(propylene \noxide) segments arranged in an ABA structure. The PEO block is hydrophilic, and the PPO \nblock hydrophobic. F127 micelles has been demonstrated to enable encapsulating hydrophobic \nAg nanoparticles inside their PPO cores and simutaneously the surface of the encapsulated \nnanoparticles is intrinsically covered by a layer of free PEO chains, which enable the Ag \nparticles to be colloidally stable [28].  The combination of HIFU technique and F127 triblock \ncopolymer is expected to allow us to produce long-term stable Ag inks, suitable for Ag inkjet \nprinting. The effects of copolymer concentration, silver content and time of HIFU treatment on \nthe rheological behaviour and size distribution were studied and an investigation on the \nsedimentation rate of the ink was also performed in this study. \n 2. Experimental \nAg nanoparticles were synthesized by a new approach. All chemicals were used as \npurchased. Silver nitrate (2g) used as Ag precursor and surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosucinate \n(AOT, 4g) as a capping agent were separately dissolved in water, forming 0.03M and 0.02M \nsolutions respectively and then two solutions were mixed by adding the surfactant solution to the \nmetal salt one. The mixture was kept stirring to form a foam. 40 ml of hydrazine, N2H4OH (1.5 \nmM) was then added to the solution. To complete the reaction 40 ml of 0.1M NaOH aqueous \nsolution was added to precipitate out Ag naoparticles. The obtained particles were then washed \nwith water and dried at room temperature. The synthesized Ag nanoparticles were firstly \nsuspended in water with wt% of Pluronic F127 ranging from 0.3% - 1.5 %.  The suspensions to \nbe treated by HIFU were contained in a sample tube\/beaker which was fixed above the shock \nwave generator (JK-06) developed by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The \nfrequency of ultrasound is set at ~ 75 kHz, and the peak intensity of shock wave varies between \n0~80 MPa. The treated time was varied between 10 and 90 min.  \nInkjet printing was carried out with a DoD Fujifilm Dimatix DMP-2831 ink jet printer.  \nThe inks were printed on two different substrates, alumina (Al2O3) (480 \u00b5m), and low \ntemperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) (250 \u00b5m) tapes. Disposable cartridges (DMC-11610) used \nin this work are equipped with 16 silicon nozzles located at 254 \u00b5m spacing; the orifice size of \neach nozzle is approximately 21 \u00b5m. The ceramics play an important role in electronics \nminiaturization and have potential to become a mass production technology for non-silicon \nMicrosystems. Using ceramic tapes it is possible to integrate small passive components on \nceramic substrates in 3-D that gives considerable possibilities for electronic miniaturization.  \nThe size and morphology of silver nanoparticles and printed patterns were determined \nusing scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the \ncrystal structure of particles. Particle size distribution was determined by nanoparticle tracking \nanalysis (NTA) (LM20, Nanosight). The rheological behaviour including stability studies was \nconducted using CVO rheometer (Bohlin instrument). The surface energy measurement was \nperformed on a contact angle system (OCA-Dataphysics).  Continuous lines with 300 \u00b5m wide, \n4.5 mm long and 2 m thick were heated at 350 \u00b0C for 1 min. After cooling down to room \ntemperature the conductivity measurements were performed using a four point probe technique. \nThe probes have been put in the four corners of the printed track and measurement of resistance \nhas been taken three times. The electrical resistivity of the printed lines was then calculated. \n \n3. Results and discussion \nSilver nanoparticles were produced in water by reduction of silver nitrate with hydrazine in the \npresence of AOT. The Ag\n+\n ions are firstly converted into silver atoms. The silver atoms then \nprecipitate to form silver nanoparticles with AOT absorbed on the surface of the silver \nnanoparticles. The color of the solution gradually changed from light brown to brown and even \nto dark brown. SEM micrograph and XRD pattern of Ag nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1. The \nprimary Ag grains are spherical with about 20 nm in diameter (Fig 1a) and the XRD pattern of \nthe silver nanoparticles obtained by Ag\n+\n reduction with hydrazine was shown in Fig 1b. The  \nXRD pattern of the Ag  shows that five diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 of 38.2\u00b0, 44.4\u00b0, 64.5\u00b0, 77.5\u00b0 and \n81.6\u00b0 respectively could be indexed as (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) Bragg's reflections \n(JCPDS file No. 04-0783) of the face-centred cubic (fcc) structure of silver. The particle size \ncould be calculated from the Ag (111) diffraction line using Scherrer's formula [29], t = k \u03bb \/ \u03b2 \ncos\u03b8, where t was the mean dimension of the crystallites, \u03b2 was the full width at half maximum \nof the diffraction peak, \u03b8 was the diffraction angle, \u03bb was the wave length of Cu K radiation \n(0.1540 nm), and k was a constant (0.89). The calculated size of silver nanoparticle protected by \nAOT was about 20 nm, which is a good agreement with the observation by SEM.  \nParticle size distribution analysis shows that the agglomerated particle sizes of the Ag \nnanoparticles are in the range of 10-300 nm, with the majority of particles larger than 120 nm as \nshown in Fig. 2.  \nThe aqueous foam was formed as a result of the mixture of AOT solution with AgNO3 \nsolution. Ag \n+ \nions were bonded electrostatically with AOT molecules at the air bubble - solution \ninterface as shown in Fig. 3. The silver ions were reduced in the foam by hydrazine resulting in \nthe formation of silver nanoparticles. The air bubble - solution interface provides a high \nconcentration of nucleation centres at which silver particles grow. The surface therefore acts as a \ngood template for crystallization. \nThe primary nanoparticles strongly attract each other through physical forces due to large \nsurface area, immediately forming larger particles.  \nHIFU has been used to assist deagglomeration and F127 to stabilize the nanoparticles in \nwater in order to obtain stable inks or nanofluids. Fig. Fig. 4 shows the influence of dispersant \nconcentration on the particle size distribution of 1 wt% Ag aqueous suspension, at different \nHIFU times. It can be seen that the average particle size is reduced with the increase of \ndispersant (F127) amount and reaches the minimum at the concentration of 0.6 wt% at any given \nHIFU time. However, at a given dispersant concentration the average silver particle size firstly \ndecreases with the time of HIFU treatment up to 60 min, and then increases to larger value at \nHIFU treatment for 90 min. The minimum particle size was obtained in a silver suspension with \n0.6 wt% F127 after 60 min HIFU treatment. Increasing the time of HIFU treatment leads to finer \nparticles and thus increases the surface area, which needs more dispersant to cover the fresh \nsurface. Therefore the amount of dispersant at tested F127 wt% may not be enough therefore \nleading to the reagglomeration. It is known that the adhesive forces of nanofine particles increase \nrapidly and become the dominant factor.  \nFig.5 illustrates the change of average particle size against HIFU treatment time for \ndifferent Ag contents at a given dispersant concentration. With the increase of the HIFU \ntreatment time up to 60 min, the particle size decreases in each sample. The less Ag content, the \nless particle size can be obtained under HIFU treatment.  Although the minimum size is possible \nto obtain in the suspension with 5 wt% Ag (60 min HIFU treatment), the increase of silver \ncontent up to 10 wt% in a suspension slows down the disaggregation process. The HIFU \ntreatment time required to reach the minimum size increases with the increase of Ag content. \nTherefore, the further work in this study focuses on the analysis of the Ag fluid with solid \nloading between 1 and 5 wt%.  \n Insufficient amount of dispersant would result in the flocculation of some particles while \nexcessive amount of dispersant would increase the viscosity, either of these is causing \ndestabilisation of the suspension. Therefore it is important to determine the optimal amount of \ndispersant in a particle suspension. Fig. 6 shows the change of viscosity against the concentration \nof dispersant at 1 wt% Ag concentration suspension. The HIFU treatment time is varied from 10 \nto 90 min for each sample. As can be seen, the viscosity values at any given HIFU treatment time \ndecrease gradually with increasing concentration of dispersant and reach a minimum at the \nconcentration of 0.6 wt%. Further addition of dispersant raises the viscosity of the suspension. \nThis specific amount of copolymer is related to the size and the surface area of the particle to be \ncovered: smaller particle size means higher surface area and hence higher amount of dispersant is \nneeded. These results shown in Fig. 4 & 6 imply that the amount of F127 required for monolayer \ncoverage and the amount required for reaching the minimum viscosity correlate very well. \n  Fig. 7 presents the ink rheological behaviour. It can be seen, as expected, that the \nviscosity rises with increasing silver content in a fluid. That is due to the increase of the \ninteraction between silver particles when solid content increases. The viscosity value for 1wt% \nof silver in ink is 1.6 mPa s and it rises up to 2.1 mPa s when silver loading increases to 5 wt%. \nFig. 8 shows the SEM picture of Ag nanoparticles in the nanofluid treated with HIFU for \n60 min. In this nanofluid, Ag content was fixed at 5 wt%. It was found that Ag nanoaprticles \nwere shown to be homogeneously distributed in the nanofluid. Without any physical treatment, \nAg nanoparticles were highly agglomerated as shown in Fig 8 (a) .  \nTo evaluate the stability of nanofluids treated by HIFU with the presence of F127 \ncopolymer, the viscosity of nanofluids, containing 5 wt% Ag nanoparticles, 0.6 wt% dispersant \nand treated by HIFU for 60 min, was measured against the time over 20 days (Fig. 9). It was \nfound that there was almost no viscosity change up to 10 days and after  this time, viscosity \nlinearly but slowly increased with the time. The increase of viscosity from 2.1 mPa s in Day one \nto 2.3 mPa s in Day 20 was due to the agglomeration and the formation of larger particle clusters. \nHowever, no sedimentation  was observed up to 20 days. The formed large particle clusters due \nto the agglomeration could be broken and re-dispersed in the water if HIFU treatment is re-used \nand the rhoelogical properties of the dispersion can resume to the inital values. We are able to \nload Ag content in our inks up to 25 wt%, but the particles in the inks form big agglomerates \nwithin a few days and subsequently the inks block the printing head. The work is ongoing to \noptimise the ratio of F127 and Ag content and HIFU treatment time for high Ag loading (>25 \nwt%) fluids. \nStable nanofluid is one of the key elements in inkjet printing. Three kinds of forces act on  \nthe suspended particles in the liquid, gravitational force, tending to settle or rise particles \ndepending on their density relative to the solvent; a viscous drag force which arises as a \nresistance to motion,  and the kinetic energy of particles which causes Brownian motion. \nFor spherical particle of radius r the viscous drag force must be equal to the gravitational force \nthus the settling velocity, V, the viscous drag force is given by: \nFdrag = 6\u03c0rV\u03b7 = 4\u03c0r\n3\n g( \u03c1p \u2013 \u03c1L )\/3 =  Fgravity                        (1) \nwhere, \u03b7 is the viscosity of the water, \u03c1P is the densities of the particles and \u03c1L is the density of \nthe medium and g is the acceleration rate of the gravity. \nClearly, from those two forces acting on small particles, it will take a very long time to \nsettle the particles and they will be stable almost endlessly. \nIn fact, the third force caused by Brownian motion, together with the attractive and \nrepulsive forces between particles determined the stability of the nanofluids.  The speed of the \nBrownian motion can be characterised by mean displacement and can be expressed with the \nequation:                     \n   tD2x2                                                                     (1) \n where D is the Einstein\u2019s Brownian diffusion coefficient and t is the diffusion time. \nIt is possible to express the diffusion coefficient with Einstein equation:    \n   \nr\nkT\nD\n3\n                                                                        (2) \nWhere k is the Boltzman constant, T is temperature, \u03b7 is viscosity of the medium and r is the \nparticle size.           \n Based on Eq. (1) and (2), it can be said that displacement caused by Brownian motion \nincreases with decreasing particles size and hence the nanoparticles tend to move around \napproaching other nanoparticles. The attractive forces between the particles will lead to their \ncollision and cause the growth of large aggregates, which will consequently settle them out as, \nwith particle growth, the gravitational forces start to dominate particle\u2019s behaviour [30]. \n Although the van der Waals forces acting between molecules will always act to coagulate \ndispersed colloids, it is possible to generate an opposing repulsive force of comparable strength. \nAs smaller particles have higher surface energy that increases the possibility of the \nagglomeration of nanoparticles, they must be stabilized by surfactant or capping reagent in their \ndispersed medium [30].           \n The prepared Ag ink has low viscosity (~2 mPa s) and desirable surface energy, 30 \nmN\/m, that is lower than the surface energy of substrates (54 mN\/m for Al2O3 and 52 mN\/m for \nLTCC), hence it ensures good wetting of the substrates by the ink; also this surface energy of the \nink is lower than the inkjet printer requirement for surface energy (max. 60 mN\/m) in order to jet \ndroplets.             \n Fig. 10 shows optical microscope pictures of printed ink on a LTCC substrate. After \nprinting, the solvent was evaporated by heating. Direct physical contact between the particles \noccurred after the organic reagents were burnt off, beginning to show neck formation [21, 31]. \nAs Ag loading in the ink is low, the multilayer printing approach helps build up dense and \nconductive films. The film consisted of 60 layers showed a reasonably low resistivity. Fig. 11 \nshows the SEM pictures of printed Ag layers on Al2O3. The film in Fig 11 (a) consisted of 60 \nlayers and was fired together at 350 \u00b0C for 60 min. The film in Fig 11 (b) also consisted of 60 \nlayers, but fired at 350 \u00baC for 20 min. after the deposition of each 20 layers. The resistivity of the \nfilm with layers fired together showed a value of 4 \u00b1 0.1 * 10\n-7\n \u03a9 m, while the film fired after the \ndeposition of each 20 layers showed a 2 \u00b1 0.1 * 10\n-7\n \u03a9 m. As can be seen in Fig. 11, the sintering \nbetween printed layers improves final structure of the film in terms of its density which is \ndirectly linked to the better conductivity. The difference between grain structures might be due to \neasier evaporation of solvent that takes place while printing in steps. Printing high number of \nlayers on top of each other results in a trapping of the water and surfactant molecules in a formed \nstructure which eventually generates pores, hence reduces the density of the film, and thus \nlowers the conductivity of printed features. \n \nConclusion \nSilver nanoparticles have been prepared through the reduction of silver ions by hydrazine in the \npresence of AOT. This is a simple, environmental-friendly and cost effective process. Particles \nare agglomerated and the average size of primary particles is about 20 nm.  A stable Ag ink was \nprepared by dispersing Ag nanoparticles in water with the presence of a triblock copolymer, \nPEO-PPO-PEO, and then being treated with high intensity focus ultrasound. The investigation of \nHIFU treatment showed that the size of Ag agglomerates was reduced down to ~50 nm from ~ \n200 nm untreated. The viscosity of the nanofluid was reduced after sonication indicating that the \nHIFU treatment could help separating the agglomerates and relatively stable inks indicated the \nhigh efficiency of the copolymer in stabilizing Ag nanoparticles in water. The printed films on \nAl2O3 tapes and LTCC substrates showed the very low resistivity. \n  \nAcknowledgments \nAuthors would like to thank the European Project (FP7) \u201cMULTILAYER: a large scale \nproduction of micro devices via new rolled multi material layered 3D shaping technology\u201d, for \nthe financial support with the reference number: FP7-NMP4-2007-214122.
