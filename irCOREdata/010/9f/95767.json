Atkinson\u2217\nDepartment of Statistics, London School of Economics, London WC2A 2AE. E-mail:\na.c.atkinson@lse.ac.uk\n1. Introduction\nProfessor Bailey has written an important and interesting paper in which experimental\ndesigns for dose escalation are developed, improved and illuminated by her understanding\nand experience of the properties of block designs (see [BaileyBailey2008]). Given the clarity of\nher exposition I have few specific comments.\n2. Caution in First Application of a Higher Dose\nThe interpretation of dose escalation studies as block designs assumes that individual cohorts\nare homogeneous. Even if they are, the Te Genero trial shows the perils that can occur for the\nfirst cohort. Recommendation 7.5.3 of [Senn, Amin, Bailey, Bird, Bogacka, Colman, Garrett, Grieve, and LachmannSenn\nsuggests that simultaneous treatment of all subjects is inappropriate. Should a similar\nrecommendation be made for the new dose in each cohort, not just the first, in case a tolerance\nthreshold is suddenly crossed?\n3. Classes of Design: quadratic trend in the response\nThe general method of development of designs in the paper is to move from principles of design\nto assessment using tools from optimum design theory. However, the comparisons can only be\nover the class of designs considered. Are there designs not in this class that have slightly higher\nvalues of, perhaps, the A-optimum criterion mentioned in Professor Bailey\u2019s \u00a76? If such designs\nexist, are they only slightly more efficient than the designs found here?\nAs one example, in the customary approach to block designs the treatment effects \u03c4i are\narbitrary constants. But, with ordered doses there may be a smooth change of response. Is it\nworthwhile modelling this, for some of the larger designs of Figure 3, as a polynomial trend?\nThe effect on the design may be appreciable; for a single cohort the optimum design for a\nquadratic model allocates equal numbers of subjects to the minimum, maximum and central\ndose, or across the two central doses if the number of doses is even.\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n24. D-optimum Design for Quadratic Trend\nI assume that the dose levels are equally spaced levels of a single factor x. Equally spaced\nintervals in logdose are another possibility although scaling of the placebo then needs special\nattention. The model for the expected response of a subject in cohort k who gets dose\nxi is \u00b5k + \u03b21xi + \u03b22x\n2\ni\n. I take the conditions (i) of Figure 3, corresponding to the last\ndesigns in Table I. With the standard design there are ten cohorts and up to 11 dose\nlevels, so that k = 1, . . . , 10; in all there are 12 parameters. Since I am interested in\nparametric curves, I used D-optimality which minimises the volume of confidence regions for\nparameter estimates. When, as here, the cohort sizes are fixed the D-optimum design for all\nparameters is the same as the Ds-optimum design for the parameters of interest \u03b21 and \u03b22\n([Atkinson, Donev, and TobiasAtkinson et al.2007, p. 206]).\nThe algorithm used to find the optimum design is a simple modification of sequential design\nconstruction ([Atkinson, Donev, and TobiasAtkinson et al.2007, \u00a711.2]). The resulting design\nfor 200 subjects is in my Table I. The important feature is that the Ds-efficiency of the design\nin Figure 3 relative to this design is 60.05%. The two designs have some features in common.\nBoth put about half the subjects in any cohort on the highest dose. One important difference\nis that this new design allocates many more patients to placebo - 82 as opposed to 27; another\nis the allocation of several subjects to central doses for the later cohorts as is to be expected.\nTable I.

The relative\nDs-efficiency of Design (i) of Figure 3 is 60.05%\n(i) n = 10,m = 20\nDose 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nCohort 1 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCohort 2 10 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCohort 3 10 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCohort 4 10 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCohort 5 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0\nCohort 6 10 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0\nCohort 7 9 0 0 0 1 1 0 9 0 0 0\nCohort 8 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0\nCohort 9 5 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 9 0\nCohort 10 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 10\n(200 subjects)\n5. Compound Designs\nA desirable feature of the designs of Figure 3, perhaps due to the \u2018Diversity Principle\u2019,\nis that the truncated designs from early stopping are close to the recommended design\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Statist. Med. 2000; 00:1\u20136\nPrepared using simauth.cls\n3for a smaller number of cohorts. This property is unlikely to hold for designs such\nas that in my table. Other criteria of optimality might give designs with better\nproperties in this respect. It is however not necessary to choose between such criteria;\ncompound criteria can be used in which a weighted product of efficiencies is maximized\n([Atkinson, Donev, and TobiasAtkinson et al.2007, cap. 21]). The purpose, as in Professor\nBailey\u2019s \u00a79, is to find designs that perform well for a variety of criteria.\n6. The Halving Principle\nThe construction of the new designs in Professor Bailey\u2019s Sections 3 and 7 by the use of a few\nstraightforward principles is appealing and should encourage their use. However, the design\nin my table is such that slightly less than half of the subjects in cohort k receive dose k for\nk = 7, 8 and 9. I think this design would be excluded by the \u2018Halving Principle\u2019. Were such\ndesigns explored?\n7. Designs for Categorized Responses\nThe design problem is made more general and simpler to solve by considering quantitative\nresponses, when the designs do not depend on the values of the parameters of the linear\nmodel, in my case \u00b5k, \u03b21 and \u03b22. A difficulty for designs for categorical response, such as those\nconsidered by [Zhang, Sargent, and MandrekarZhang et al.2006], is that the designs depend\non the unknown parameters of the logistic models used to categorise the response variables.\nHowever, if the effects being explored are small, the results of [CoxCox1988] indicate that\ndesigns for normal theory linear models are likely to be efficient. In any application numerical\nexploration will be needed to determine the region over which designs for continuous response\nhave adequate efficiency.\nREFERENCES\n[Atkinson, Donev, and TobiasAtkinson et al.2007].
