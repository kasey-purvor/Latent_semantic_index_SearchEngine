INTRODUCTION\nS TROKE is one of the most common causes of death andthe leading cause of severe disabilities in the U.K. [1], [2].\nIt occurs when an artery to the brain bursts or becomes blocked,\nthereby stopping or interrupting the blood supply to the brain [1].\nThis usually results in an infarct in the brain, which comprises\ndead tissues due to the stroke. The detailed information about\nthe location and volume of the infarcts is crucial to a number of\nstroke-related research questions, such as predicting prognosis,\nManuscript received March 28, 2007; revised July 13, 2007 and October 2,\n2007.\nThe authors are with the Department of Psychology, University of Surrey,\nGuildford GU2 7XH, U.K. (e-mail: shan.shen@surrey.ac.uk; a.szameitat@\nsurrey.ac.uk; a.sterr@surrey.ac.uk).\nColor versions of one or more of the figures in this paper are available online\nat http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TITB.2007.911310\nidentifying chronic functional deficits [3]\u2013[7], or investigating\nsleep problems of stroke patients [8], [9]. In addition, the avail-\nability of a lesion mask may also be beneficial to analyses of\nfunctional MRI [10] and diffusion tensor imaging. Therefore,\nan effective lesion detection method is highly desirable.\nWith the fast advancement of MRI, which provides high-\nresolution images, the detection of infarct lesion is becoming\nincreasingly more feasible [11]. However, due to their arbitrary\nshapes and locations, segmentation of lesions is a complex and\nchallenging task. Manual delineation is thus widely employed\nfor this purpose [12], [13], but it is very time-consuming, which\nmay be an unrealistic approach when a large amount of data\nneeds to be processed. Another disadvantage of manual lesion\ndelineation is that the results are highly dependent on the ex-\npertise of operators. In this case, continuous efforts have been\nmade on automatic detection of different types of lesions in the\nliterature. Although a great number of segmentation methods\nare available, such as thresholding [14], region growing [15],\nand clustering [16]\u2013[21], they are problematic when applied\nto the lesion detection. This is because lesions often possess\nsimilar intensities to some normal tissues. For example, in T1-\nweighted MR images, an infarct lesion is shown with intensities\nsimilar to those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or gray matter\n(GM), so that a standard segmentation approach would group\nthem together rather than separately. In order to solve this prob-\nlem, multispectral MR images were employed for the purpose\nof lesion detection by many researchers. For example, Anbeek\net al. [22]\u2013[24] presented a segmentation method for white mat-\nter (WM) lesions using five different MRI modalities including\nT1-weighted, inversion recovery (IR), proton-density-weighted\n(PD), T2-weighted, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery\n(FLAIR). It is based on a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifica-\ntion technique, which builds a feature space from voxel intensity\nand spatial information. Sajja et al. [25] used PD-weighted, T2-\nweighted, and FLAIR MR images to segment multiple sclerosis\n(MS) lesions, which involved techniques such as Parzen win-\ndow classifier, morphological operations, hidden Markov ran-\ndom field\u2013expectation maximization (HMRF-EM) algorithm,\nand fuzzy connectivity. A similar approach was employed by\nDatta et al. [26] to identify black holes in MS. Van Leemput\net al. [27] proposed an intensity-based tissue classification al-\ngorithm implemented with T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted scans\nusing a stochastic model for normal brain images and simulta-\nneously detects MS lesions as outliers that are not well explained\n1089-7771\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nSHEN et al.: DETECTION OF INFARCT LESIONS FROM SINGLE MRI MODALITY 533\nby the model. Many other lesion segmentation studies based on\nmultispectral anatomical MRI scans were reported in [28]\u2013[34].\nHowever, in the majority of clinical situations, only one type\nof anatomical MR image is collected, since the acquisition of\nmultispectral anatomical images is more time and cost intensive.\nLonger scanning times are further not feasible in many patients\ndue to the severity of their condition. There is a large number of\nexisting patient data with just one anatomical MRI. Extracting\nlesion information from these data is only realistic if automatic\nsegmentation algorithms are not confined to multispectral im-\nages. Therefore, the development of a robust automatic lesion\ndetection approach, which is capable of detecting lesions from\na single anatomical MRI scan, is essential. A few attempts have\nbeen made to detect brain abnormality using T1-weighted MR\nimages only. Cuadra et al. [35] used a priori models of le-\nsion growth to segment large brain tumors. However, it is a\nsemiautomatic approach where a seed voxel of tumors has to be\nchosen manually. The selection thus requires anatomical and bi-\nological knowledge of tumor growth. Stamatakis and Tyler [36]\npresented a statistical method to identify brain lesions. They\ncompared individual patient images to a normal control group\nbased on the general linear model and the detected significant\nstructure differences between the patient and the controls were\nregarded as lesions. Srivastava et al. [37] employed a similar sta-\ntistical approach to detect focal cortical dysplastic (FCD) lesions\nfrom a lesion-specific feature map constructed by computing the\nratio of cortical thickness over absolute image intensity gradi-\nent. However, the disadvantage of these statistical segmentation\nmethods is that the selection of a control group (e.g., group\nsize) may have an impact on segmentation results [38]. Another\npotential limitation of this type of methods is that patient data\nand control images should be scanned using the same scanner,\ncoils, and identical parameters, otherwise additional bias may\nbe introduced. This issue hence restricts the general application\nof this type of methods to lesion identification.\nAs stated before, using the traditional segmentation method\nalone is insufficient to identify lesions from normal tissues ow-\ning to their intensity similarity. Among the studies using mul-\ntispectral MR images, Wei et al. [39] demonstrated that the\naddition of a template-driven approach to EM algorithm signif-\nicantly improved the segmentation accuracy of WM abnormali-\nties. Kamber et al. [40] generated a 3-D tissue probability model\nusing healthy controls and demonstrated that, with the assistance\nof the model, four segmentation methods tested reduced false\npositive detection of lesions by 50\u201380%. These studies demon-\nstrated that the usage of spatial information would improve the\ncapability of traditional segmentation methods in lesion iden-\ntification. It thus brings an idea that a proper combination of\na traditional segmentation method and some spatial informa-\ntion of brain tissues may allow detecting lesions from a single\nanatomical MR image effectively.\nTherefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a fully\nautomatic 3-D segmentation approach to detect infarct lesions\nfrom a single anatomical MRI scan. It is implemented by calcu-\nlating the likelihood of an inconsistency between segmentation\nresults derived from voxel intensities and tissue partitions based\non spatial location. More specifically, with a prior knowledge of\nnormal tissue distribution in the brain, the probability of each\nvoxel belonging to each tissue type is known in an MR image.\nIf the same image is segmented based on voxel intensity, the\nvoxels, where lesions are present, are more likely to be assigned\nto a different tissue class rather than the one suggested by the\ntissue distribution. Therefore, the degree of the inconsistency\nbetween them is calculated, which may indicate the likelihood\nof these voxels being lesions. In this paper, the conventional\nfuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is employed for intensity-based\nsegmentation. The spatial-location-based tissue distribution is\nprovided by prior tissue probability maps.\nIn Section II, materials and the basic theory of FCM is intro-\nduced, as well as how the FCM algorithm cooperates with the\ntissue probability maps to detect lesions. In Section III, in order\nto validate the performance of our method quantitatively, sim-\nulated lesions controlled for variables such as lesion sizes and\nlesion signal reduction are presented, along with the definitions\nof performance evaluation parameters. Segmentation results on\nboth simulated and real lesions are described in Section IV, in\nwhich the proposed method is also compared with the statistical\nlesion detection approach. Section V discusses issues relating\nto the detection accuracy of the proposed method. Conclusion\nis addressed in Section VI.\nII. MATERIAL AND METHODS\nA. Image Acquisition\nIn all, 15 stroke patients1 (female = 5, mean age = 54.27, and\nstandard deviation = 10.96, >12 months after stroke, seizure-\nfree, and had no history of mental health problems) and 26\nhealthy subjects (male = 6, mean age = 22.77, and standard\ndeviation = 4.47) have been scanned in this study. All MR im-\nages were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner (Erlangen,\nGermany). High-resolution 3-D brain MRI images were ob-\ntained using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid ac-\nquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence, with the\nfollowing characteristics: repetition time (TR) = 1830 ms, echo\ntime (TE) = 4.43 ms, inversion time = 1100 ms, one acquisition,\nflip angle = 11\u25e6, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, 176 slices,\nvoxel size = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm, and in-plane matrix =\n256 \u00d7 256. Prior to scanning, all participants gave written in-\nformed consent according to the guidelines of the University\nof Surrey Ethical Review Board. Participants were paid for\nparticipation.\nB. FCM Clustering Algorithm\nThe FCM clustering algorithm was introduced by Bezdek\n[41], which is one of the most popular segmentation methods\nin the literature [16], [18], [19]. When FCM is applied to the\nsegmentation of gray-scale images, such as MRI, it classifies\nvoxels in an image into a prespecified number of clusters based\non voxel intensities. It employs a fuzzy membership U to de-\nscribe the degree of likeness of one voxel to each cluster. The\nmembership is determined by intensity differences between the\n1The stroke patients in this study who have either left- or right-hand motor\ndeficits were recruited for a two-week recovery therapy.\n534 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nvoxel and the center of each cluster, which is expressed as\nuij =\n1\n\u2211C\nk=1\n(\nd(xj ,v i )\nd(xj ,vk )\n)2\/(m\u22121) (1)\nwhere xj (j = 1, . . . , N ) represents the voxel intensity, N is\nthe number of voxels in an image, vi (i = 1, . . . , C) refers\nto cluster center that is an approximation of average intensity\nin this cluster, while C is the number of clusters, d2(xj ,vi)\nmeasures a similarity between xj and vi by calculating their\nEuclidean distance, and m \u2208 (1,\u221e) is a weighting exponent on\neach fuzzy membership, which controls the degree of fuzziness.\nThe FCM algorithm iteratively optimizes an objective func-\ntion with continuous updates of fuzzy memberships and cluster\ncenter, until a convergence is reached. The detailed description\nof FCM can be found in [19]. As only one type of MR images\nis input for segmentation in this paper, the fuzzy membership U\nis a C \u00d7N data matrix.\nC. Segmentation of Lesion Cluster\nTissue probability maps are maps that describe the probabil-\nity of each voxel belonging to specific classes of tissues in a\nstandard space. They are usually created by images obtained\nfrom a large group of healthy participants, thus representing an\naveraged topology of tissues in the brain. The tissue probability\nmaps used in this paper are modified versions of International\nConsortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM: http:\/\/www.loni.ucla.\nedu\/ICBM\/), which are the default maps provided in Sta-\ntistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5: http:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.\nuk\/spm\/). The original data were derived from 452 T1-weighted\nMR images, and then affine registered to the Montreal Neu-\nrological Institute (MNI) space and down sampled to 2 mm\nresolution.\nLet T be tissue probability maps, where T is a C \u00d7N\ndata matrix, and C represents the number of probability maps,\nwhich is identical to the cluster number in FCM, and tij \u2286 T\nrefers to the probability that the ith voxel belongs to the jth\ncluster.\nThe FCM algorithm segments each voxel into a prespecified\nnumber of tissues based on its intensity, while the tissue prob-\nability maps classify each voxel into these clusters of tissues\naccording to the location of the voxel. Given an image from a\nhealthy participant, the intensity-based and the location-based\nsegmentation should be similar. However, if there are lesions\npresent, the earlier two are more likely unmatched. Therefore,\nlesions may be detected by their extent of inconsistency. The\nhigher the inconsistency at each voxel, the more likely it is a\nlesion.\nI = {I1 , I2 , . . ., Ij , . . ., IN } describes a measurement of in-\nconsistency between the fuzzy membership and the probability\nmaps. Ij \u2208 [0, 1]. It is defined as\nIj =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n0, k = s\n1, tkj < 0.1 and k \u0005= s\n\u03b1\u00d7 |ukj\u2212tkj |+\u03b2 \u00d7 |tsj\u2212usj |,\n2 otherwise (2)\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of segmentation procedure.\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the weighting parameter (\u03b1 \u2265 1, \u03b2 \u2265 1),\nmax(Uj ) = ukj (k is the cluster with the highest membership\nat the jth voxel), and max(Tj ) = tsj (s is the cluster with the\nhighest probability at the jth voxel).\nIf Ij >\nukj +tsj\n2\n, then the jth voxel= lesion(j=1, . . . , N).\n(3)\nIn more details, if the fuzzy membership and the tissue prob-\nability maps assign a voxel into the same cluster, then it is clear\nthat they show no inconsistency (Ij = 0). If the membership\nclassifies the jth voxel to the kth cluster, the probability maps\nindicate that this voxel only has less than 10% (tkj < 0.1) prob-\nability to be the same cluster, the inconsistency is defined as the\nmaximum (Ij = 1). In other cases, the measurement of incon-\nsistency is derived from an average disagreement between the\nfuzzy membership and the probability, i.e., the difference be-\ntween the maximum membership and the corresponding proba-\nbility, plus the difference between the maximum probability and\nthe corresponding membership. Weighting parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2\nare used to adjust the proportion of these two differences in\nthe average. Finally, if the inconsistency at any voxel is higher\nthan the mean of its maximum membership and probability, this\nvoxel is then regarded as lesions.\nD. Segmentation Procedure\nFour probability maps are utilized in this approach (i.e.,\nC = 4), including background, CSF, GM, and WM, in which\nthe background map is the inversed image of a brain mask, pro-\nvided in SPM5 while the latter three maps are adapted versions\nof ICBM atlas.\nFig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the whole segmentation\nprocedure. As stated before, the probability maps are in the MNI\nspace. In order to match the individual brain to the maps, an ini-\ntial registration step is required to normalize original images to\nthe MNI space. The normalization method employed is a unified\nsegmentation approach embedded in SPM5, which enables im-\nage registration, tissue classification, and bias correction to be\nSHEN et al.: DETECTION OF INFARCT LESIONS FROM SINGLE MRI MODALITY 535\ncombined within the same generative model [21]. This approach\ncan segment the healthy brains but provides no option of lesion\ndetection. Likewise, the traditional normalization approach in\nSPM5 can also be used for this purpose. Depending on the\nvoxel size of normalized MR images, the tissue probability maps\nare sampled to the identical resolution (in this paper: 1 mm \u00d7\n1 mm \u00d7 1 mm) using the trilinear interpolation algorithm. A\nsmoothing kernel of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) =\n10 mm is applied to the sampled maps so as to cover more vari-\neties of the brain, such as different brain sizes and bigger\/smaller\nventricles.\nThe brain mask mentioned before is applied to normalized\nMR images for the removal of nonbrain regions, such as skull.\nThen, the brain-only images are segmented using the FCM al-\ngorithm into background, CSF, GM, and WM. The fuzzy mem-\nberships for each cluster are smoothed with a Gaussian kernel\nof 4 mm to increase the connectivity among neighboring voxels.\nNext, the inconsistency between the fuzzy membership and\nthe sampled and smoothed prior probability maps are calculated\nbased on (2). The lesions are then identified by (3).\nSmall clusters are always present in detected lesions. They\nare more likely noise or artifacts rather than true lesions. There-\nfore, clusters with voxel numbers less than 1000 (i.e., volume\nof 1 cm3) are removed by morphological labeling. Furthermore,\nfalse positive segmentation happens often on edges of the brain\nbecause of residual variances to the probability maps after nor-\nmalization. Hence, the detection of lesions excludes regions\naround edges of the brain using the brain mask. Finally, le-\nsions are inversely normalized from the MNI space back to the\noriginal brain space.\nIII. VALIDATION\nA. Simulated Lesion\nIn order to validate the proposed lesion detection method\nquantitatively, simulated lesions were introduced into images\nfrom healthy participants. Therefore, exact sizes and locations\nof lesions were known, which could be regarded as the ground\ntruth of lesions. Instead of using sphere or cube, irregular shapes\nof simulated lesions, which are more representative to real le-\nsions, were generated using a 3-D region of interests (ROI)\ncreation tool provided in MRIcro (http:\/\/www.sph.sc.edu\/comd\/\nrorden\/mricro.html). Initially, origins of ROIs were chosen man-\nually, along with varied radius and intensity differences at both\norigin and edge. The created 3-D ROIs were saved as binary\nmasks and then overlaid on images of healthy participants in-\ndividually. The intensities within the ROIs were reduced by a\nuniform percentage of original intensities in the overlaid im-\nages. According to analyses on real lesions, it was reported that\nlesioned areas in T1-weighted images comprise 30\u201390% signal\nreduction when compared to healthy tissues [36]. Therefore, to\ncover the variety of lesions, each simulated lesion in this pa-\nper was constructed to include an intensity reduction of 20%,\n40%, 60%, and 80%, respectively. Nineteen ROIs in different\nsizes (1.147\u2013153.743 cm3 , mean = 54.34 cm3) and locations\nwere generated. Hence, a total of 19\u00d7 4 images with simulated\nlesions were created for validation purpose.\nB. Performance Evaluation Parameters\nTo evaluate the performance of the lesion detection method,\nthree popular accuracy measurements were used, introduced\nby [24]\nsensitivity = Aref \u2229Aseg\nAref\nspecificity = (I \u2212Aref ) \u2229 (I \u2212Aseg )\nI \u2212Aref\nsimilarity index = 2\u00d7 Aref \u2229Aseg\nAref \u222aAseg\nwhere Aref represents the ground truth, which is regions with\ntrue lesions (i.e., simulated lesions in this paper). Aseg represents\ndetected lesions by the proposed method. I refers to the whole\nimage for segmentation.\nSensitivity measures a true positive detection rate, and speci-\nficity measures a true negative detection rate. Similarity index\n(SI) is derived from a reliability measure known as the kappa\nstatistic, which is sensitive to both size and location of segmen-\ntation [23], [24], [31], [42], [43].\nIV. RESULTS\nIn this section, experimental results are described to validate\nthe performance of the proposed method. Both simulated and\nreal lesions were employed. With the simulated lesions, the de-\ntection accuracy was measured using the evaluation parameters\ndefined before. The real infarct lesions from stroke patients were\nalso used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method\nin practice. The results of a comparison between our method\nand a statistical approach presented in [36] were described.\nUnless otherwise stated, a value of 2 was employed for the\nweighting exponent m in FCM, since it yielded the best results\nin most images and generally used in the application of FCM.\nAdditionally, \u03b1 = 1.5 and \u03b2 = 1 were used in (2). The whole\nlesion detection approach was implemented in MATLAB. It\ntook approximately 4 min to process an image on a Window XP\ncomputer with 2.80 GHz CPU and 3.5 GB of RAM.\nA. Simulated Lesion\nWhen images with simulated lesions were segmented, the\nresults suggested that the lesions were generally well detected.\nFig. 2 illustrates four examples of the detected results at the\nsimulated lesions with 60% of intensity reduction. Fig. 3 shows\na bar chart of the average sensitivity, specificity, and SI at dif-\nferent intensity reduction rates. It demonstrated that the highest\naccuracy was achieved at the lesions with 60% intensity reduc-\ntion (sensitivity = 0.900, specificity = 0.999, SI = 0.879), while\nwith the 20% reduction, the accuracy is the lowest (sensitivity =\n0.385, specificity = 0.999, SI = 0.511).\nFig. 4 shows the sensitivity and SI with regards to the lesion\nvolume. It is clear that with a higher intensity reduction in\nlesioned area, segmentation accuracies were not affected by\nlesion volume. In contrast, with a lower intensity reduction,\nsegmentation accuracies varied but with no relation to lesion\n536 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 2.

The enlargement of ventricle was\nalso identified.

Furthermore,\nlesions on cortical regions were sometimes undetected such as\nin patient 4 (left hemisphere).\nC. Comparison Between the Proposed Method\nand the Statistical Lesion Detection Method\nThe statistical lesion detection method described in [36]\nand [37] was tested to compare with the proposed method.\nThe control group included 26 healthy participants. Individual\nstroke patients were compared to the whole control group, after\nthe normalization of all images to the MNI space and smooth-\ning by a Gaussian kernel of FWHM = 8 mm. Brain volume,\nage, and gender were included in the design matrix to exclude\nconfounding effects. Significant structure differences (i.e., le-\nsions) between each patient and the control group were detected\nusing a threshold of p < 0.001 (uncorrected). The parameters\nemployed, such as the smoothing kernel and the threshold, were\nsuggested to be optimal for lesion detection in terms of [36].\nOverall, the statistical method acquired smoother regions of\nlesions, but its performance was not always consistent. Fig. 6\nshows three examples of results in the normalized (MNI) space\nobtained from both the statistical and the proposed methods.\nFig. 6(a) illustrates the detections on patient 5, where lesions\nSHEN et al.: DETECTION OF INFARCT LESIONS FROM SINGLE MRI MODALITY 537\nFig. 5.

DISCUSSION\nThis paper presents a new lesion detection approach that only\nrequires one type of anatomical MR image. The performance\nof the proposed method was tested on both simulated and real\nlesions. The use of simulated lesions provided the ground truth\nof lesion information, such as lesion size and location, which\nallowed us to validate the detection performance quantitatively.\nDifferent signal reduction percentages were introduced in le-\nsioned areas. The results showed that simulated lesions with\n20% signal reduction were detected with the lowest accuracy,\nwhile lesions with 60% lesions were detected with most pre-\ncision. According to previous research in [36], in real lesions,\n538 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nthe intensity near the lesion border, which consists of a mixture\nof the normal tissue and the lesion, is reduced less (30\u201340%)\nas compared to the center of the lesion. As it is generally ac-\ncepted that an SI greater than 0.7 indicates excellent agreement\nbetween detected lesions and true lesions [31], [42], [44], it is\nsuggested that lesions with 40\u201380% intensity reduction were\nall well detected by the proposed method. This implied that\nour method was capable of identifying the major part of real\nlesions, with comparable accuracy to existing lesion detection\nmethods using multispectral MRI scans [22]\u2013[24], [43]. How-\never, parts of lesion borders might be undetected if only minor\nlesions were included. In addition, it is worth noticing that the\nspecificity acquired in our method is always higher than 0.99,\nbecause nonlesioned regions are much bigger than the region of\nlesions in each image.\nWhen spherical simulated lesions were employed, the current\nmethod obtained an average of 0.96 for sensitivity and 0.99 for\nspecificity, along with 0.97 for SI, which were better than the\nresults of Stamatakis and Tyler [36]. [The highest true positive\nrate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity) achieved\nwere greater than 0.9.]\nReal infarct lesions from stroke patients were detected using\nboth the proposed method and the statistical approach presented\nin [36]. The results showed that the lesions were generally well\ndetected by our method. The compared statistical approach iden-\ntified lesions successfully in some images, but failed in others\n(as shown in Fig. 6). As stated in the literature [38], the selec-\ntion of a control group (e.g., group size) may have an impact on\nsegmentation results, while many covariates such as brain vol-\nume, age, and gender may also influence structure differences\nbetween a patient and a control group, thus altering the detection\naccuracy for lesions. All these factors are possible contributors\nto the inconsistent performance seen with the statistical lesion\ndetection approach. It may be the case that if a higher number of\nhealthy participants are included, the reliability of the statistical\ndetection approach will be improved. However, further testing\nis required to comment on this issue.\nFurthermore, in terms of the basic theory of the proposed\nmethod in this paper, the detection errors mainly occur due to\na location mismatch between the fuzzy memberships and the\ntissue probability maps. Adjusting the settings and parameters\ninvolved may improve its detection performance. This includes\nreducing the false positive and false negative detection rates.\nMore detailed discussion on these issues now follows.\nA. False Positive Detection\nFalse positive detection may occur under the following cir-\ncumstances: first, when the maximum inconsistency is as-\nsigned, there is still a small possibility [although less than 10%,\ntkj < 0.1 in (2)] that the tissue probability indicates a segmen-\ntation identical to the membership. In order to lower the false\npositive rate due to the aforementioned reason, the percentage\nmay be reduced.\nSecond, false positive detection may also be found around the\nventricle because of its varied shape and size across participants.\nIncreasing the smoothing kernel size used for tissue probability\nmaps loosens constraints on spatial location, and thus, may\nreduce false positive detection in this region. Furthermore, an\nenlargement of ventricles was identified as lesions in the current\napproach, but it might be considered as false positive in some\napplications. To prevent ventricle detection, a CSF template\ncould be applied.\nB. False Negative Detection\nAs stated in the results, lesions in cortical regions may be\npartly undetected. In fact, cortical lesions were identified in most\ncases, but then were eliminated from the final detection by the\nbrain mask in the cleaning step. However, without applying the\nmask, a great deal of false positive detections may be included\nin the results. This is due to residual errors of normalization\nbetween the normalized brain and the tissue probability maps.\nTo solve this problem, either the mask could not to be applied\nor the threshold of masking could be reduced.\nIn addition, small clusters with less than 1000 voxels (1 cm3\nin 3-D volume) were removed from the final detection by the\ncleaning step. Although a cluster smaller than this size is likely\nto be noise, especially for an infarct lesion, true lesions may still\nbe removed. Hence, where there are small lesions, the threshold\nof 1000 voxels could be lowered.\nMoreover, an increase of weighting parameters in (2) may\nenhance the sensitivity (reduce the false negative) of detection\nbut lower the specificity, and vice versa. This is clear from the\nequation that higher \u03b1 and \u03b2 lead to a greater inconsistency and\nraise the likelihood of a brain region being detected as lesions.\nMost importantly, it is worth noticing that there is always a\ncompromise between false positive and false negative detection.\nReducing one often means increasing the other. Therefore, the\nsettings of parameters may be adjusted in order to find the best\nbalance according to specific characteristics of lesions studied.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nAn automated lesion detection method based on identifying\ninconsistent classification using voxel intensity and spatial loca-\ntion of tissues in MR images has been proposed in this paper. It\nrequires only a single type of anatomical MR image, which is the\nmost prominent advantage over other lesion detection methods.\nThe performance validation using simulated lesions sug-\ngested that the proposed method achieved detection accuracies\nhighly comparable to other studies in which multispectral MR\nimages were used. The identification of real infarct lesions from\nstroke patients further demonstrated the capability of the pro-\nposed method in lesion detection. Moreover, a statistical lesion\ndetection approach, which also requires one single type of MR\nimage, was applied to real lesions. The results when compared\nto those of the current method revealed that the current method\nis more reliable.\nThe disadvantages of the presented method include that small\nlesions (<1 cm3) are undetected due to the cleaning step after\nlesion detection. Additionally, the enlarged ventricle is always\ndetected as a lesion that may be considered as false positive.\nFinally, parts of detected lesions around cortical regions may be\nSHEN et al.: DETECTION OF INFARCT LESIONS FROM SINGLE MRI MODALITY 539\nremoved by the application of the brain mask. Therefore, a bit\nof care is required when choosing the settings of the parameters.\nAccording to characteristics of the proposed method, it may\nbe capable of detecting lesions caused by brain injury, dementia,\nor tumor. Other MRI modalities, not restricted to T1-weighted\nimages, may also be employed for the purpose of lesion detec-\ntion. Finally, future work will focus on improving the current\napproach for a more general application, such as detecting small\nlesions, e.g., MS lesions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] The Stroke Association U.K. (2006, May).
