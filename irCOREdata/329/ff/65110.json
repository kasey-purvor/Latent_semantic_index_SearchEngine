Compensatory visual exploration training aims to \nimprove the searching skills of these patients in order to help them to cope more effectively. \nHowever, until now the efficacy of this training has not been compared to that of a control \nintervention. Given that exploration training uses the visual search paradigm, which is known \nto require visual attention, in this study the efficacy of the technique was compared to a \ntraining that requires visual attention but not exploration. Participants completed either \nexploration training (n = 21), or attention training followed by exploration training (n = 21). \nAssessment of the visual field, visual search, reading and activities of daily living were \nperformed before and after each intervention that the participants completed. The results \nrevealed that both the exploration training and the attention training led to significant \nimprovements in most of the visual tasks. For most of the tasks exploration training did not \nprove superior to attention training, and for reading both types of intervention failed to yield \nany benefits. The results indicate that attention plays a large role in the rehabilitation of \nhomonymous visual field defects.  \n \nKeywords: compensation; hemianopia; rehabilitation; visual attention \n \nAbbreviations: AT = attention training; ET = exploration training; HVFD = homonymous \nvisual field defect; RT = response time; VIQ = visual impairments questionnaire.   \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nA visual deficit is a relatively common consequence of brain injury (Schlageter et al., 1993) \nand homonymous visual field defects (HVFDs), including hemianopia, are one of the most \nprevalent problems. The extent of spontaneous visual recovery experienced is variable, it \ndoes not occur in all patients and complete recovery is rare (Zihl and Kennard, 1996). \nTherefore, many patients are left with chronic and disabling visual loss. Patients with HVFDs \nhave difficulties searching their environment, leading to disorientation and problems in \navoiding obstacles. HVFDs can impair activities such as reading and driving, and reduce \nemployment opportunities, contributing to feelings of insecurity, isolation and depression \n(Zihl and Kennard, 1996).  \nTwo main rehabilitative approaches have been examined, and there are numerous \nreviews available which provide a detailed analysis of each technique (Kerkhoff, 2000; \nPambakian et al., 2005; Bouwmeester et al., 2007; Pelak et al., 2007; Lane et al., 2008). \nRestorative methods, such as vision restoration therapy, aim to partially restore vision \nthrough repeated visual stimulation. Whilst controlled studies have found that vision \nrestoration therapy can significantly expand the visual field (Kasten et al., 1998, 2001), the \nbenefits are greater for patients with optic tract lesions rather than cortical damage, and it is \nthe latter that are of interest here. Furthermore, vision restoration therapy is a controversial \ntechnique as contradictory findings with regards to visual field expansion have been reported \n(Kasten et al., 1998, 2001; Sabel et al., 2004; Reinhard et al., 2005; Schreiber et al., 2006; \nMueller et al., 2007).  \n \n  \nThe second, less controversial approach is compensatory visual exploration therapy. \nPatients with HVFDs often exhibit disorganised oculomotor behaviour (Zihl, 1995a), and \nconsequently the training involves visual search tasks which are designed to encourage more \nefficient oculomotor exploration. This compensatory training can improve saccadic \n4 \n \nbehaviour, increase the search field (the area of visual space in which stimuli can be detected \nusing eye-movements) and improve visual search performance (Kerkhoff et al., 1992b, 1994; \nNelles et al., 2001; Pambakian et al., 2004).\n \n Two studies confirmed that the improved search \nperformance was significantly greater than that observed during untrained periods (Kerkhoff \net al., 1994; Pambakian et al., 2004), and a recent study reported that the gains are specific to \ncompensatory therapy since they were not found following restorative flicker-stimulation \ntraining (Roth et al., 2009). It therefore appears that compensatory training is a promising \ntreatment option for patients with HVFDs. However, what is currently missing is an \nevaluation study which compares exploration training with an appropriate control \nintervention.  \nVisual search tasks require not only efficient exploratory eye-movements, but also \nvisuo-spatial attention \u2013 in fact, this paradigm is frequently used to study visual attention \n(Treisman and Gelade, 1980). No previous study has investigated the relative contribution of \nthese two processes to HVFD compensation, and it is therefore unclear to what extent the \nimprovements are due to specific training of oculomotor exploration or more general \nimprovements in attention. In order to assess the relative effectiveness of these two aspects, \nthe present study compared the efficacy of standard visual exploration training (ET) with \nvisual attention training (AT). All patients were assessed using a variety of outcome measures \nincluding perimetry, visual exploration and visuomotor search tasks, reading and a visual \ndisability questionnaire. Furthermore, the study used two intervention groups: one received \nonly ET and the other received both AT and ET. Importantly, assessment on the outcome \nmeasures was made both before and after each intervention (including after AT and before \nET). Therefore, between-subject and within-subject comparisons could be used to examine \nwhether ET (which incorporates both the elements of attention and exploration) is superior to \nAT (which involves attention in the absence of exploration).  \n5 \n \n \nMethods \nParticipants \nThe study was approved by Durham University and the Multi-Centre Research Ethics \nCommittee (05\/MRE03\/29). Forty-six patients with HVFDs as a consequence of a post-\nchiasmatic lesion (confirmed by reports from a clinical consultant) participated in the study. \nThe first 23 were assigned to group A (ET), and the last 23 to group B (AT and ET). All gave \ninformed written consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (International \nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors, 1991). One patient dropped-out from group A through \npersonal choice and another died. One patient dropped-out from group B through illness, \nwhilst another was excluded as a consequence of mid-study neurosurgery. The two groups \ndid not differ with regards to age, gender, aetiology, duration of HVFD or baseline visual \nsearch performance (Table 1). All patients had a HVFD, although the extent and laterality of \nthe defect differed on an individual basis (Table 1). Example baseline visual field plots \n(Figure 1) from two patients demonstrate the individual variability.  \n \nInsert Table 1 \nInsert Figure 1 \n \nThe exclusion criteria for participant selection included visual field loss as a \nconsequence of pre-chiasmatic or chiasmatic damage, additional eye-movement disorders, \nphotosensitive epilepsy, progressive neurological disorders or insufficient speech, language, \ncognition or mobility to be able to complete the tasks. Some patients had additional \ndifficulties including hemiplegia or hemiparesis (n = 8), memory and cognitive impairments \n(n = 4), aphasia (n = 2) and diplopia (n = 2). Four patients (two in each group) had a \n6 \n \ncomorbid neglect as indicated by their medical records and confirmed with the star \ncancellation task (Halligan et al., 1991). Participants had to be at least 18 years of age. \nThe minimum amount of time that had elapsed since onset was three months in order to \nminimise confounding by spontaneous recovery (Pambakian and Kennard, 1997).  \n \nStudy design \nTwo groups of patients were included in the study. Group A received only ET. Group B \nreceived AT followed by ET. This resulted in three training conditions: ET in group A, AT in \ngroup B, ET in group B. For each training session patients were assessed on all outcome \nmeasures both before and after training. This design allowed within-subject comparisons to \nbe made (AT versus ET within group B), overcoming problems associated with unmatched \npatient samples by comparing performance within a given patient. However, such \ncomparisons result in possible confounds with order effects \u2013 i.e. the first training might \nexhaust training potential thereby reducing the benefit possible with another intervention, \npotentially underestimating the efficacy of the second therapy. To compensate for this, \nbetween-subject comparisons were also made (ET effects in group A versus AT effects in \ngroup B).  \n \nTraining methods \nThe training programs were created using E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., \nPittsburgh, PA) and participants conducted the training at home using a laptop computer. \nBoth types of training consisted of 15 sessions and patients completed 288 trials per session \n(9 tasks with 32 trials each). The computer screen was viewed binocularly at approximately \n57 cm. Participants sat comfortably such that they were centrally-aligned with the computer, \nwith their hands resting on the keyboard. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly \n7 \n \nand accurately as possible. Task difficulty was increased across the sessions by reducing \nstimulus presentation time. This was modified for each session and for each participant \nindividually, and was determined so that accuracy levels exceeded 80%. Performance \nfeedback (\u201ecorrect\u201f or \u201eincorrect\u201f) was provided after each trial and at the end of each task. \nEach trial began with a central fixation cross presented for 1 second, followed by the task \ndisplay which was presented until the participant made a response using a specific key-press, \nor until the pre-determined trial duration was reached.  \n \nExploration training (ET) \nEach session consisted of nine visual search tasks; three feature searches, four conjunction \nsearches and two comparative searches. The three feature and four conjunction tasks involved \nthe participant deciding whether a specific target was present (50% of occasions) or absent, \nsearching an array of between 9 and 18 items. In feature searches the target was defined by \none characteristic (i.e. colour, shape or size) whilst in conjunction searches it was defined by \ntwo of these characteristics (i.e. the target is a blue x, with the distractor items being red x\u201fs \nand blue k\u201fs). The two comparative searches involved patients deciding whether two pictures \n(one on each side of the display), containing a series of between 3 and 9 real-life objects, \nwere the same or different. For each of these tasks the displays subtended ~30\u00ba horizontally \n(15\u00b0 in each hemifield) and ~21\u00ba vertically. Participants were instructed to look at the central \nfixation cross which was presented at the start of each trial for 500 ms, and could move their \neyes freely once the array appeared. Specific instructions for how participants should move \ntheir eyes were not provided, and instead they were permitted to develop their own search \nstrategies. The mean duration of the training was 4 weeks (range: 2-9 weeks), with each \nsession typically lasting approximately 40 minutes.  \n \n8 \n \nAttention training (AT) \nThe AT was designed to be as similar as possible to the ET, but the exploration component \nwas removed by positioning all stimuli close to fixation; the displays subtended 1\u00ba in each \nhemifield. For those patients with macular sparing (57%) all stimuli could be perceived \nwhilst fixating centrally, whilst for those patients with macular splitting a slightly eccentric \nfixation (<1\u00b0) was required to bring all stimuli into view. This was determined at the start of \nthe training. No additional eye-movements were required to view the display throughout the \ntraining sessions, and participants were instructed to try and maintain fixation as much as \npossible. As with the exploration training there were nine tasks; three feature searches, four \nconjunction searches and two mental rotation tasks. For the feature and conjunction searches \nfour items were presented, each subtending ~0.5\u00b0 (except for the small letters which \nsubtended half of this height), with the innermost edge of the items ~0.5\u00b0 from fixation. For \nthe mental rotation tasks one item (a number, letter or symbol) was displayed in the centre of \nthe screen. The item could be facing the normal direction or else could be mirror-reversed, \nand was presented in one of five different orientations (rotated by 0\u00ba, 45\u00ba, 135\u00ba, 225\u00ba or 315\u00ba). \nParticipants had to decide whether the standard or mirror-reversed version of the stimulus \nwas presented. The mean duration of the AT was 3.5 weeks (range: 2-7 weeks), with each \nsession lasting ~30 minutes on average.  \n \nVisual assessment tests \nBinocular visual fields were mapped using manual kinetic T\u00fcbingen perimetry (Oculus Inc., \nT\u00fcbingen, Germany) with a standardised background luminance of 3.2cd\/m\u00b2. The target \nstimulus was a white circle with a 0.25\u00b0 diameter and a supraliminal brightness of 160cd\/m\u00b2. \nThe target was moved inwards from the peripheral visual field at an approximate speed of 2\u00b0 \nper second until detected. Participants placed their head into the chin-rest, were instructed to \n9 \n \nkeep their eyes on the red circle (0.30\u00b0 in diameter) in the centre of the perimeter and to press \nthe buzzer when they could see the target. The visual field border was measured for 24 \nmeridians (horizontal, vertical and diagonal, each 15\u00b0 apart; Figure 2) in a pseudo-random \norder. Fixation was monitored through an oculoscope and a meridian was re-tested when eye-\nposition shifts were detected.  \nThe eccentricity of the border separating the seeing and blind portions of the field was \nmeasured along each of the 24 meridians and could vary between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The amount of \nvisual sparing in each hemifield (blind and seeing) was determined by calculating the mean \neccentricity of the border across all 13 meridians (11 on each side plus both vertical \nmeridians) for the left and right sides of the visual field. Figure 2 provides more detail on \nhow the amount of visual sparing was calculated.  \n \nInsert Figure 2 \n \nPerformance on visual search was examined using a find-the-number task in which \nparticipants had to search for a number (between 1 and 9) hidden amongst four or eight \ndistractor symbols (i.e. &, %, \u00a3), and then verbally report the number presented. Participants \nwere instructed to fixate centrally at the start of each trial (a fixation spot was presented for 1 \nsecond) and could move their eyes freely once the array appeared. Once the number was \nreported by the participant, the experimenter used a key-press to end the trial, a blank screen \nwas displayed and the experimenter then typed in the response. For this task participants were \npositioned in a chin-rest to maintain viewing position. All items were 1\u00b0 in height and the \ntarget appeared with equal frequency in each of the four screen quadrants. The array \nsubtended 40\u00b0 horizontally and 30\u00b0 vertically. Participants completed 40 trials per session. \n10 \n \nThe mean response time (RT) was calculated across the trials, using only the trials in which \nthe correct response was provided.  \nVisual search performance across a greater area of the visual field than directly \ntrained was assessed using a 16 item conjunction visual search task that was projected onto a \nwall, such that the array subtended approximately 60\u00b0 horizontally and 53\u00b0 vertically \n(projected search). The target was a red forward slash, with blue forward and red backward \nslashes as distractors. All items were ~5\u00b0 in height. The target was present on 50% of trials \nand appeared in each array quadrant equally. Participants were instructed to fixate the central \ncross at the start of each trial, but were free to move their eyes once the array was presented. \nResponses regarding the presence or absence of the target were made using a response box \n(Cambridge Research Systems, Rochester, UK). Participants completed 40 trials per session. \nMean RT was determined for the target-present trials, calculated using only correct-response \ntrials.  \n Visuomotor search performance was measured using a task in which participants had \nto search an array of 20 numbered blocks (each 3 cm\u00b3), sequentially pick them up and place \nthem into a container as quickly and accurately as possible. The blocks were displayed in a \ncentral array atop a table, and were positioned using a polystyrene grid (54 cm by 88.5 cm) \nwhich was removed after the blocks were positioned. The task was repeated for between five \nand ten trials per session. RT (in seconds) was recorded from the time the participant touched \nthe first block until the final block was placed in the container, and mean RT was calculated \nacross the trials.  \nReading ability was assessed using four modified passages taken from \u201eThe Grey \nGentlemen\u201f (Ende, 1974) which were matched for difficulty; a group of healthy control \nparticipants (n =17) read all passages at a non-significantly different speed (\u03c7\u00b2 (3) = 1.59, p = \n0.662). Each passage contained 200 words, presented in a 14-point Arial font with double-\n11 \n \nspacing and left-alignment. Participants were required to read aloud one passage at each \nsession. Reading time (in seconds) and the number of errors made were recorded. The \ncorrected reading speed in words per minute (wpm) was calculated using the following \nformula: (words read \u2013 number of errors) \/ time x 60.  \nThe participants completed a ten-item rating-scale questionnaire (visual impairments \nquestionnaire; VIQ), modified from the version developed by Kerkhoff et al. (1994). \nParticipants had to rate the level of impairment they experienced with particular activities, \nwith higher scores indicating more difficulty.  \n \nStatistical analyses \nFor each training condition (ET in group A, AT in group B and ET in group B) two-tailed \nWilcoxon signed ranks tests were conducted to compare performance before and after \ntraining, to determine if the training was beneficial. Training effects were then calculated for \neach training condition (post-training performance minus pre-training performance) to \ncompare the relative effects of AT and ET. Within-subject comparisons (AT in group B \nversus ET in group B) were conducted using Wilcoxon signed ranks tests (dependent \nsamples), whilst the between-subject comparisons (AT in group B versus ET in group A) \nwere performed using Mann-Whitney U tests (independent samples). \n \nResults \nFor each training condition (ET in group A, AT in group B, ET in group B) Wilcoxon signed \nranks tests were conducted for all of the assessment tasks to compare performance before and \nafter the training (Table 2).  \n \nInsert Table 2 \n12 \n \n \nPerimetry: \n \nInsert Figure 3 \n \nThe mean visual field border at baseline was comparable for both groups (Figure 3; (U = 184, \np = 0.498)). Significant increases were found for both the blind and seeing hemifields, after \nboth ET and AT (Table 2 and Figures 4-5). Figure 5 demonstrates the variability of the \nchange within each hemifield, depicting the mean change for each of the meridians \nseparately. The within-subject analyses revealed that the two types of training had similar \neffects on the size of the blind (z = -0.04, p = 0.970) and the seeing hemifields (z = -1.12, p = \n0.263). The same outcome was found in the between-subject analyses (blind hemifield: U = \n148, p = 0.106; seeing hemifield: U = 168, p = 0.273). Therefore, ET does not lead to a \ngreater increase in the visual field than AT.  \n \nInsert Figure 4 \n \nInsert Figure 5 \n \nFind-the-number visual search: \nIn all conditions mean accuracy exceeded 97.1% and changes in RT cannot be attributed to a \nmeaningful speed-accuracy trade-off effect. For both groups significant improvements in RT \nwere found after ET but not AT (Table 2 and Figure 6). The two types of training had a \nsignificantly different effect on find-the-number task performance as revealed by the \nbetween-subject analyses (U = 116, p = 0.009). However, this was not confirmed by the \n13 \n \nwithin-subject comparison (z = -0.43, p = 0.664), possibly resulting from an order-effect of \nthe training or the slightly faster baseline RT in group B relative to A. For this task ET led to \nsignificant improvements whereas AT did not, and the relative benefit of ET compared to AT \nwas significant when each training was completed independently.  \n \nInsert Figure 6 \n \nProjected visual search: \nFor all conditions accuracy was between 81% and 86%, and any improvements in RT were \nnot the consequence of a speed-accuracy trade-off effect. Significant improvements in RT \nwere observed for ET in group A and AT in group B, although not for ET in group B (when \ncompleted after AT; Table 2 and Figure 7). There was no significant difference between the \neffects of the two training types as shown by the between-subject analyses (U = 356, p = \n0.922). However, the within-subject comparison revealed a significant difference (z = -2.56, \np = 0.011): AT was more beneficial than ET. This is most likely the result of an order-effect \nwhereby the scope for improvement was exhausted by the first intervention, as demonstrated \nby the similarity in the magnitude of the training effects between ET in group A and AT in \ngroup B.  \n \nInsert Figure 7 \n \nVisuomotor search: \nPercentage accuracy was determined based on the number of errors made (blocks missed or \npicked up out of sequence), of which there were 20 possible per trial. Mean accuracy \nexceeded 97.9% for all sessions and changes in RT cannot be attributed to a speed-accuracy \n14 \n \ntrade-off effect. Both the ET and the AT led to significant improvements in RT (Table 2 and \nFigure 8). The relative effects of the two interventions were not significantly different as \nrevealed by both the within-subject (z = -0.43, p = 0.664) and the between-subject \ncomparisons (U = 203, p = 0.660). Therefore, for this task ET was not superior to AT.  \n \nInsert Figure 8 \n \nReading: \nOverall there was a significant effect of defect side on reading performance at the baseline \nsession (\u03c7\u00b2(1) = 41.00, p < 0.001) with patients with a right-sided defect being more impaired \nthan those with a left-sided defect (Table 3). Also, patients with macular splitting were \nsignificantly more impaired than those with macular sparing (z = -5.58, p < 0.001).   \n \nInsert Table 3 \n \nNeither ET nor AT had a significant effect on reading performance (Tables 2 and 3). \nThe laterality of the HVFD and the extent of macular sparing did not significantly affect the \nchange in reading performance resulting from intervention (p > 0.150), although the sample \nsize makes it difficult to examine such effects reliably. Since neither training type affected \nreading the relative effects of the two conditions were not compared.  \n \n \nVIQ: \n\u201eReading\u201f was the only item to show a significant improvement (lower score) after ET in \ngroup A (z = -2.51, p = 0.012; Table 4). This effect was not replicated in group B, and AT did \nnot affect this either (Table 4). Neither training had a significant effect on any other item. \n15 \n \n \nInsert Table 4 \n \nSince reading was the only item for which a significant effect was observed it was the \nonly item compared. Intervention type proved non-significant both for the within-subject (z = \n-0.43, p = 0.668) and between-subject analyses (U = 148, p = 0.061). The latter statistic was \nhowever nearing significance, indicating that ET might have a somewhat greater effect on \nincreasing patients\u201f subjective assessment of their own reading ability.    \n \nDiscussion \nThe present study revealed significant post-training improvements in most outcome measures \ndemonstrating that ET can lead to generalised improvements in visual search. Whilst not \nevery task can benefit (specifically reading), it appears that the training effects do transfer to \ndifferent tasks requiring visual exploration. However, with the exception of the find-the-\nnumber task, comparable effects were always obtained with the attention training, thus \nquestioning the need for specific visual exploration training. The following discussion \nfocuses on why, in general, attention training proved as effective as visual exploration \ntraining, and then examines the two exceptions: the find-the-number task and reading.  \nThe most likely explanation for why both types of training yielded similar benefits is \nthat visual attention plays an important role in HVFD compensation, and that both \ninterventions improve the patients\u201f attentional capacities. As mentioned previously the visual \nsearch paradigm has been used to examine visuo-spatial attention (Treisman and Gelade, \n1980), and therefore one might expect that training involving this paradigm would also act as \nan attention training. Zihl (2000) proposed that spatial shifts in attention associated with \nvisual search were likely to enhance oculomotor modification resulting from exploration. \n16 \n \nHowever, perhaps the surprising finding reported here is that attention training on its own \nalready conveys most of the benefits which are associated with the more specialised \nexploration training. This certainly suggests that previously the role of attention in HVFD \nrehabilitation may have been underestimated.  \nThis attentional account can also explain the somewhat counter-intuitive finding of \nbilateral visual field enlargements following both interventions, although the perimetry data \nis susceptible to experimenter bias and subsequently must be interpreted with caution. Visual \nfield increases after compensatory training have sometimes (Kerkhoff et al., 1992b, 1994)\n \nbut \nnot always (Pommerenke and Markowitsch, 1989; Zihl, 1995a; Nelles et al., 2001; \nPambakian et al., 2004) been observed. However, they were reported only for the affected \nhemifield and were interpreted as signs of training-induced visual restoration. The fact that \nsuch increases were also found in the patient\u201fs intact visual hemifield and can be achieved \nwith an attentional training suggests that the field enlargement may reflect improved \nattention. It is plausible that the increased visual detection reflects an enhanced ability to shift \nvisuo-spatial attention: shifting attention enhances the excitability of preserved portions of \nthe visual cortex thereby lowering the detection threshold in the particular corresponding \nvisual field location. This is in line with psychophysical (Carasco et al., 2004), physiological \n(Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004), behavioural (Lu and Dosher, 1998; Simons and Chabris, \n1999; Smith and Schenk, 2008), functional imaging (Pessoa et al., 2003) and transcranial \nmagnetic stimulation evidence (Bestmann et al., 2007) that attention can modulate perception \nand cortical excitability. More specifically it has also been demonstrated that the size of the \nvisual field can be significantly improved when patients with HVFDs learn to allocate \nattention to parts of their visual field (Trexler, 1998; Schendel and Robertson, 2004; Smith et \nal., 2008). Furthermore, Kasten et al. (2007) recently observed a significant post-vision \nrestoration therapy visual field enlargement that was not specific to the trained location, and \n17 \n \nthat was correlated with increased spatial attention and alertness. Finally, it should be noted \nthat the changes in the visual field that we have reported here were measured using manual \nkinetic perimetry, and the results might therefore be specific to this method. Thus it might be \nworthwhile to re-examine this question using other forms of perimetry. \nWhilst it seems reasonable to associate the benefits with improved visuospatial \nattention, there are alternative mechanisms to consider. Many patients have limited awareness \nof their visual loss immediately after onset (Celesia et al., 1997; Townend et al., 2007) and \nmay not compensate spontaneously because of this. Being involved in training may increase \npatients\u201f awareness of their HVFD, subsequently leading to them altering their behaviour. It \nis also possible that sustained attention is enhanced by training, which could lead to the \nobserved improvements in functioning across multiple tasks. Sustained attention training can \nimprove symptoms of neglect (Robertson et al., 1995) and it is possible that AT was working \nin a similar manner by enhancing concentration and thus performance. Furthermore, for those \npatients with macular splitting, AT involved them adopting a slightly eccentric fixation \ntowards the blind hemifield in order to bring the full array into view, and it is possible that \nthis contributed to their improved performance. The results at present do not allow one to \ndistinguish between the possible mechanisms of compensation.  \nIn principle it is possible that the observed improvements are simply a consequence of \nspontaneous recovery. This is unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, patients did not participate \nuntil at least three months post-onset, and therefore the potential for spontaneous recovery \nwas substantially reduced (Pambakian and Kennard, 1997). Secondly, previous research has \nestablished improved visual search to a similar magnitude as reported here only during \nperiods of training (Kerkhoff et al., 1994; Pambakian et al., 2004). It can therefore be argued \nthat the findings from this study are better understood if one assumes that both training types \nlead to significant attentional gains in patients with HVFDs. However, this does not explain \n18 \n \nwhy the find-the-number task benefitted only from ET but not AT, and why reading \nperformance did not improve at all.  \nThese exceptions are best understood in a framework which assumes that ET \nimproves both visual attention and task-specific skills. While many visual tasks will benefit \nfrom the improvement in visual attention, only tasks which share essential features with the \ntraining tasks will benefit from the acquisition of task-specific skills following ET. The find-\nthe-number task shares one essential aspect with ET: in both cases the stimuli to search are \npresented on a computer screen. Therefore the set of saccadic amplitudes and search \nstrategies that prove successful during ET will also improve performance in the find-the-\nnumber task. While performance in the find-the-number task benefitted from AT, this was \nnot true for projected search. This prompts us to ask why training might be beneficial for one \ntype of visual search and not the other. At the moment we can only offer some speculations. \nThe projected search task requires participants to report the presence\/absence of a specified \ntarget (red \/), whereas the find-the-number task requires participants to report which of 10 \npossible numbers is present. This type of accurate identification requires that items are \nfoveated, which is perhaps not essential in the projected-search task, especially given the \nlarger item size in the latter task (~5\u00b0 relative to 1\u00b0). Accurate eye-movements may therefore \nbe of greater importance for the find-the-number task possibly explaining why AT on its own \ndid not lead to a significant improvement in this task. \nA similar analysis also explains why reading did not improve. During reading the eyes \nscan in the direction of the text in a step-wise manner (horizontal saccades interspersed with \nfixations), followed by a large saccade returning the eyes to the beginning of the next line \n(Rayner, 1998). The compensatory strategies needed for reading not only differ from those \nused during exploration, but also for left versus right-sided HVFDs (Trauzettel-Klosinski and \nBrendler, 1998). Little transfer should therefore be expected from the exploration training to \n19 \n \nreading, and the results from this study further demonstrate that enhanced attention alone \ncannot replace the teaching of the required reading-specific oculomotor strategies. Kerkhoff \net al. (1992a) and Zihl (1995b) previously reached similar conclusions and developed \nspecific reading training. The efficacy of a reading training has recently been demonstrated \nby Spitzyna et al. (2007) and such training has been found to improve reading but not visual \nsearch (Schuett et al., 2008). Schuett et al. (2008) reported that patients\u201f reading ability can \nbe improved using non-word material as effectively as using words. Like the present study, it \nrevealed that that the content of training displays could be simplified. Furthermore, both \nstudies show that the generalisation of training improvements are possible to some extent if \nthe transfer task requires similar (but not content-specific) skills, but that there are also limits \nto this; reading training does not benefit search, and ET does not benefit reading. \nWith regards to the questionnaire-item \u201creading\u201d, the difference between pre- and post-\ntraining assessment was almost significantly greater for ET than for AT (p = 0.06). It should \nbe stressed that this is a purely subjective assessment by the patients, which does not correlate \nwith the objective outcome measure. Similar discrepancies between subjective and objective \noutcomes for visual training have been reported before (Reinhard et al., 2005), and suggest \nthat self-reports do not provide a reliable indicator of functional improvement. The greater \neffect of ET than AT on subjective assessment of reading ability might simply reflect \npatients\u201f perception that reading is more similar to the tasks involved in ET. \nThe results reported here imply that for the most part the two interventions are equally \nas effective, and both provide a practical rehabilitation option since training can be completed \nat home using standard computer equipment. However, there are other factors to consider \nwhen determining preference. AT is simpler than ET to program and it is faster to complete. \nAlso, due to the limited size of the display needed for AT (2\u00b0) it may be possible to perform \nthis training using existing, non-medical technologies such as mobile phones or portable \n20 \n \ngames consoles, which would make it cheaper. Therefore, if research can confirm the \ncomparable functional efficacy of the techniques then AT may be the preferred option.  \nClinical efficacy has not been unequivocally established for any HVFD rehabilitation \nprocedure, and large randomised controlled trials are required in order to address this issue. \nSuch research could help to confirm the relative efficacy of AT and ET, including using \nautomated perimetry to examine the visual field. Future studies should include measures of \nattention to assess the effect of visual training procedures on attentional capacity. It should \nalso be noted that for some aspects of functioning small but non-significant improvements \nwere observed. Our results cannot exclude the possibility that those aspects might also benefit \nfrom training, but it is clear that the effects are relatively small and substantially larger \nsamples may therefore be needed to demonstrate these effects. \nIn conclusion, the findings from this first study comparing visual exploration training \nwith a control intervention might seem disappointing given that visual exploration training \nhas been consistently viewed as a promising HVFD rehabilitation approach. The findings \nsuggest that exploration training is not significantly better than attention training. However, \nthis could also be seen as positive news. It suggests that a simple attention training presented \non a small display, potentially even on portable games-console, can provide many of the \nbenefits observed after exploration training. However, this study also highlights the limits of \nthis approach: hemianopic dyslexia, one of the most disabling consequences of HVFDs, is \nnot improved by either training. This suggests that an effective HVFD treatment requires both \ngeneral and specific components, in accordance with other areas of cognitive rehabilitation \n(Sohlberg and Mateer, 2001). The treatment should include a general training of visual \nattention in addition to the teaching of skills and strategies that are specific to functionally \nrelevant activities, such as reading (see also Kerkhoff et al., 1992b, 1994).   \n \n21 \n \n \nFunding \nThe study was funded by an Economic and Social Research Council and Medical Research \nCouncil studentship (number PTA-037-2004-00025, AL). \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank staff from James Cook University Hospital, City of \nSunderland Hospitals, Newcastle-Upon Tyne Hospitals (especially Alison Jones) and Action \nfor Blind People for their assistance with the recruitment of suitable participants for the \nstudy.

Examples of the baseline visual field of two patients. Plot A demonstrates a patient \nwith a left-sided hemianopia with a minimum of 3\u00b0 of macular sparing. Plot B is an example \nof a patient with a right-sided hemianopia with macular splitting.  \n \n  \n33 \n \n \nFigure 2. Diagram representing the 24 meridians assessed during the perimetry with 11 \nmeridians for each side; the two vertical meridians (X1 and Y1) were used for both fields, \nresulting in a total of 13 eccentricity values for the blind\/seeing border for each hemifield. \nEach concentric circle represents 10\u00b0 of visual angle. The mean left visual field border was \ncalculated using the formula (X1 + X2 + ... + X12 + Y1) \/ 13, whilst the mean right visual field \nborder was calculated using (Y1 + Y2 + ... + Y12 + X1) \/ 13.  \n \n \n34 \n \n \nFigure 3. Diagrams representing the mean baseline visual field border (in degrees) for each \nmeridian for groups A (panel A) and B (panel B) separately.

Bar-graphs showing the mean visual field sparing for the blind (dark bars) and \nseeing (pale bars) hemifields, for each assessment session (baseline and post-training) for \ngroup A (Fig. 4A) and group B (Fig. 4B). The error bars represent the standard error of the \nmean and * indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05).  \n \n \n36 \n \n \nFigure 5. Diagrams representing the mean change in the visual field size (in degrees). Each \nconcentric circle represents 1\u00b0 of visual angle, and changes less than 1\u00b0 have not been \ndepicted. There are separate plots for the blind and seeing hemifields, and for each group \nand condition. Data from patients with left and right sided defects were collapsed and \npresented within one hemifield, namely the left hemifield.   \n37 \n \n \nFigure 6.
