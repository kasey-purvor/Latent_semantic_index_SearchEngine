The article concludes with a \ndiscussion of the complexities of implementing youth-friendly projects in communities \n 2 \nsteeped in top-down adult-dominated social interactions, and recommends ways in \nwhich similar projects might seek to involve youths more effectively. \n \nKeywords: case studies, community management, community participation, interventions, \nrural communities, youth workers \n \nIntroduction \n \nYouth are increasingly called upon to become involved in HIV prevention at \nthe global, national and local levels (UNGASS, 2001; UNICEF, 2002; \nUNAIDS, 2006; South African Government, 2007). Three reasons for this are \napparent. First, and most clearly emphasized, is the fact that youths \u2014 \nespecially young women \u2014 are particularly at risk of HIV-infection. \nInternationally, estimates suggest 45% of all new HIV-infections are among \nyoung people ages 15 to 24 years and this is skewed significantly towards \nfemales, especially in South Africa (Pettifor, Rees, Kleinschmidt, Steffenson, \nMacPhail, Hlongwa-Madikizela et al., 2007; UNAIDS, 2008). Second, given \nthe high levels of unemployment and under-employment among young people \n(International Labour Organization [ILO], 2007), they represent a huge pool of \nuntapped talent and labour to involve in such projects. Third, there is \nincreasing recognition that the participation of young people in HIV-prevention \nprogrammes is necessary if programmes are to respond to the needs and \ndesires of young people and therefore be effective (Campbell, 2003). \n \nDespite these calls, the meaningful participation of youth in HIV-prevention \nprogrammes is incredibly difficult to achieve (Campbell, Foulis, Maimane & \nSibiya, 2005; Whitehead, Kriel & Richter, 2005; Campbell, Gibbs, Maimane, \nNair & Sibiya, 2009). Many approaches to understanding the barriers to youth \nparticipation have focused on sociological factors, such as poverty, inter-\ngenerational inequality and HIV stigma (Campbell et al., 2005; Ezra & \nMchakulu, 2007; Perkins, Borden, Villaruel, Carlton-Hug, Stone & Keith, 2007; \nCampbell et al., 2009). As Cleaver (1999) highlighted, much less research has \nfocused on people\u2019s motivation for involvement or non-involvement in \nparticipatory projects.  \n 3 \n \nIn this article we move away from a sociological perspective towards a social-\npsychological approach to understanding youth participation in HIV\/AIDS \nprojects by exploring how wider sociological factors shape young people\u2019s \nsocial identities and motivations (Campbell & Gibbs, 2009). We do so through \na discussion of a case study of youth participation in a community-led \nHIV\/AIDS project in South Africa. \n \nTheoretical framework \nSocially structured identities are a key influence on people\u2019s behavioural \nchoices. An individual\u2019s social identity consists of a person\u2019s subjective sense \nof self \u2014 both in the present and in terms of future aspirations. This sense of \nself defines limits and possibilities on people\u2019s action and behaviours, as well \nas the extent to which people are likely to exercise agency in the face of life \nchallenges and social obstacles, or else view them with a sense of fatalism \nand helplessness (Howarth, 2006). Madhok (2005) argues that people\u2019s \nagency is a socially embedded, constructed and enabled experience. As \nsuch, people\u2019s agency is shaped by wider social and material structures in \nsociety, which are constraining (in terms of limiting individuals\u2019 agency) but \nalso productive, opening up certain possibilities for agency and action. \nHowever, Fassin (2007) argues that in some situations the inequalities of \nrace, class and gender may undermine the agency of individuals more than \nwe realise. Such limited agency undermines people\u2019s health and wellbeing \nand stops people acting to protect their health (Wallerstein, 1992).  \n \nEchoing Fraser\u2019s (1992) work on \u2018counter-public spheres,\u2019 Cornish (2006) \nargues that participatory projects can create \u2018micro spaces\u2019 situated outside \nthe normal relationships of power and inequality which limit people\u2019s agency, \nthereby providing a context in which they can collectively negotiate ways to \nresist some of the negative effects of marginalisation on their health by \ndeveloping more empowered social identities and a more confident and \npositive set of future aspirations for personal health and wellbeing.  \n \n 4 \nThe Entabeni Project in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, sought to \nprovide such micro spaces through facilitating youth participation in a project \nseeking to strengthen local community responses to HIV\/AIDS. The project \nspecifically sought to facilitate effective local community responses rather than \n\u2018intervening from the outside,\u2019 as is often the case with youth programmes. Its \ncommitment to facilitating youth participation in shaping and implementing \nHIV\/AIDS programmes, rather than imposing externally designed programmes \non young people, was based on the assumption that these projects have a \ngreater chance of success if they build on existing resources and work to \nensure that project goals and activities resonate with local youths\u2019 own \nperceptions of their needs and interests (Campbell, 2003; Gruber & Caffrey, \n2005; Campbell, Nair & Maimane, 2007). The needs and interests of youths \nvary and manifest differently from one local community to another. This \nmilitates against the possible success of one-size-fits-all approaches that are \ndesigned and evaluated according to the preconceptions of professionals who \nusually come from outside the community (and possibly from outside the \nprovince or country).  \n \nThe aim of youth involvement in the Entabeni Project was to provide micro \nspaces in which young people could develop their skills in group decision-\nmaking and project management and leadership, in a context where young \npeople have been traditionally excluded from playing a significant role in \ncommunity life (Campbell et al., 2009). The assumption was that these \nexperiences would improve the confidence and self-esteem of the young \npeople to act in new and health-enhancing ways, providing spaces for \ndialogue through which young people could collectively renegotiate their \nsocial identities. Ideally they would do so in ways that would allow them to \nresist some of the negative effects of their marginalisation, to expand their \nagency, and to begin to take control of their sexual health (Ramella & De la \nCruz, 2000; Cornish, 2006). Yet, as will become clear below, the project had \nlimited success in encouraging youths\u2019 participation. This article explores \nsome of the reasons for this. \n \nThe Entabeni community and project \n 5 \nEntabeni is a rural community of about 28 000 people, located in KwaZulu-\nNatal Province, where about 35% of pregnant women are HIV-positive and \nthere are high levels of poverty, unemployment and ill health (Barron, Day, \nMonticelli, Vermaak, Okorafor, Moodley & Doherty, 2007). Many of the \nresidents migrate to urban centres to search for work (Posel, 2003; Hunter, \n2007). Local governance of Entabeni is formally shared between the elected \ngovernment of the local municipality1 and the traditional chief (inkosi), who \ndelegates control of day-to-day matters to his traditional councillors (izinDuna; \nsingular: inDuna). In reality the municipality plays a minimal role in this \nparticular community and residents are effectively under the control of the \ninkosi and izinDuna.  \n \nThe authors are part of the Centre for HIV\/AIDS Networking (HIVAN), a \nuniversity-based NGO seeking to improve networking among those involved \nin HIV\/AIDS work in KwaZulu-Natal. The Entabeni Project emerged from a \ntwo-year study exploring community responses to HIV\/AIDS in Entabeni \n(Campbell et al., 2007), during which time HIVAN were asked by community \nleaders to facilitate a project strengthening the community\u2019s ability to cope \nwith HIV and AIDS.2 The project aimed to develop skills and support networks \nfor an already existing cadre of local health volunteers (Maimane, Campbell, \nNair & Sibiya, 2004). \n \nAgainst this background, HIVAN took on the three-year role of external \nchange agent to facilitate two types of partnership to support the health \nvolunteers (Campbell, Nair, Maimane & Sibiya, 2008). The first type of \npartnership the Entabeni Project sought to facilitate was with \u2018external \npartners\u2019 \u2014 representatives of regional public-sector health and welfare \nbodies outside of Entabeni, as well as with the regional municipality (Nair & \nCampbell, 2008). The second type was with \u2018local partners\u2019 in the community \nwho had hitherto given the health volunteers\u2019 limited support and recognition; \nthese included local leaders, women\u2019s and faith-based groups, as well as local \nyouths.  \n \n 6 \nYouths had been identified as a key resource to support local health \nvolunteers in a series of workshops that HIVAN facilitated with community \ngroups. These workshops fed back HIVAN\u2019s research results and \nbrainstormed directions for the evolving Entabeni Project. In the workshops, \nyoung people were very keen on becoming involved, and the young people \nand adults agreed that youths were an essential but underutilised and \nunderappreciated resource. \n \nFor the purposes of the Entabeni Project and this article, young people were \nclassified as people between ages 14 and 35, and according to whether they \ncurrently attended school (learners) or not (out-of-school youths). While \nrecognising the complexity of these broad definitions, they were in line with \nthe Entabeni residents\u2019 own classification of young people.  \n \nThe aim of the \u2018youth component\u2019 of the Entabeni Project was to build a group \nof between 70 and 100 young people who could provide peer education, \ncounselling, and other HIV\/AIDS-related services to community members and \nalso serve as role models of empowered youth leadership. It was envisaged \nthat their involvement would boost youth participation in the Entabeni \ncommunity and also be a springboard to the wider social development of \nyoung people.  \n \nOver the course of its three-year existence, the Entabeni Project engaged in \nthree sets of youth-related activities. The first activity was a youth rally \nconceived by the health volunteers as a way of drawing HIV\/AIDS to the \nattention of youths. While the rally successfully attracted over 800 people, its \neffectiveness in engaging young people and building their agency was limited. \nTwo adult male community leaders dominated the rally\u2019s organising \ncommittee and insisted that the event only promote sexual abstinence as an \nHIV-prevention strategy. HIVAN\u2019s representative on the committee cited our \nfinding that many young people were already sexually active and thus argued \nfor a broader HIV-prevention message, including promoting the use of \ncondoms. However, this input was ignored and HIVAN were obliged to accept \n 7 \nthe decision given our commitment to a \u2018community-led and community-\nowned\u2019 project (Campbell et al., 2007). \n \nThe second set of activities was a series of training programmes for young \npeople, run by an external NGO. The different training programmes variously \ntargeted out-of-school youths and learners. Out-of-school youths were \nprovided with counselling training \u2014 involving skills to provide a range of \nHIV\/AIDS-related and general health-related information to community \nmembers, \u2018traditional\u2019 one-on-one counselling skills, and information on how \nto access regional health and welfare grants and services. The aim was that \nthis group of out-of-school youths would then run and staff an \u2018outreach \ncentre\u2019 in Entabeni. This centre would provide health and welfare counselling \nservices to the community and be supported by the NGO via ongoing training, \nmentoring and support for the youth counsellors through an NGO outreach \nworker. \n \nInitial enthusiasm among out-of-school youths was high, and 20 young people \nvolunteered to participate. However, the drop-out rate was high, and only \nseven young people completed the counselling training. Subsequently this \ndropped to only four people active at the outreach centre. And while at times \nthese four have been remarkably active, the outreach centre did not expand to \nprovide extensive services to the community, and the four individuals who are \nstill involved have received only limited support from the NGO.  \n \nThe same NGO provided peer-education training to learners at the local high \nschool. Again, initial enthusiasm for this was high. Yet despite HIVAN\u2019s efforts \nto urge the NGO to facilitate maximum youth participation in the peer-\neducation training, the NGO persisted in their habitual style of didactic training \n\u2014 in this case, giving formal lessons in HIV\/AIDS awareness \u2014 and failed to \nprovide learners with the skills or support they needed to lead peer-education \nactivities themselves.  \n \nThe third aspect of support for young people involved the HIVAN project team \nproviding the four out-of-school youths who were active at the outreach centre \n 8 \nwith support and additional training in order to build their leadership skills and \nexperience, initially in the Entabeni Project and then in the wider community. \nThis meant providing regular advice and personal counselling to these young \npeople to build their self-esteem and confidence. It also included providing \nthese four, and an additional six Entabeni youths, with opportunities to \nundertake additional training at the university linked to HIVAN (some distance \nfrom Entabeni) to further build their HIV\/AIDS-related skills and confidence. \nWhile the youths enjoyed these opportunities and participated enthusiastically, \nthis did not translate into the additional six participants becoming more \ninvolved in HIV\/AIDS work in Entabeni. Furthermore, while the four committed \nyoung people became more vocal in the Entabeni Project and are now \nconsidered project leaders in the context of the outreach centre, they have \nconstantly struggled to assert their influence with a number of older men who \nattempt to retain authority in the project (Campbell, Gibbs, Maimane & Nair, \n2008; Campbell et al., 2009). Additionally, the leadership roles of the young \npeople have not extended outside the project as originally anticipated. \n \nOverall, the Entabeni Project has not succeeded in its goal of mobilising \nbetween 70 and 100 young people to participate in HIV-prevention work and \nusing this as a springboard for wider social development. Apart from the four \nout-of-school youths currently involved in the outreach centre, young people in \nEntabeni have generally chosen not to pursue opportunities for involvement or \nleadership in the project.  \n \nHere, we explore the possible reasons for the Entabeni Project\u2019s limited \nsuccess in mobilising local young people, based on the assumption that \nyouths are most likely to engage in activities that resonate with their social \nidentities and life goals (Campbell, 2003). The first part of the findings \nexplores what the young people in our study wanted out of life (their life goals) \nand the pathways through which they sought to achieve these. The second \npart reflects on the extent to which the Entabeni Project\u2019s aims and activities \nsucceeded or failed to resonate with the social identities and life goals of local \nyouths.  \n \n 9 \nMethods \n \nThe data consist of two sets of semi-structured interviews, focus group \ndiscussions and fieldworker diaries. The first set of data comprises 14 \nindividual interviews and two focus group discussions involving a total of 37 \nyoung people (22 females and 15 males), conducted during our initial \nresearch in Entabeni in 2004. Sampling ensured that a range of young \npeople\u2019s views were elicited; this included young people both in and out of \nschool as well as two young women who were already involved in the home-\nbased care group in 2004 when HIVAN first engaged with the community. \n \nIn the second set of data, four interviews and two focus group discussions \ninvolving a total of 21 young people (15 females and 6 males) were conducted \nafter the Entabeni Project had finished in 2008. The topic guides covered \nsimilar issues: young people\u2019s perceptions of the Entabeni community, \nHIV\/AIDS and their hopes for the future. The second round of interviews also \nexplored young people\u2019s perceptions of the project and whether or not it \nresonated with what youths wanted in life. Those sampled in the second \nround had all been directly involved in the Entabeni Project \u2014 but to varying \ndegrees. Some had been extensively involved while others had limited \nengagement. Young people both in and out of school were included. \nHowever, we were unable to contact the small group of young people who \nhad been trained by the project but had subsequently left Entabeni to live or \nwork elsewhere.  \n \nInterviews were conducted by the third author in Zulu, and were tape \nrecorded, translated and transcribed. Ethical approval for the baseline \nresearch was received from the University of Natal university ethics \ncommittee. Approval for the second stage of the research was received from \nthe ethics committee at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (clearance number: \nHSS\/05052A). All interviews were guided by informed consent, anonymity and \nconfidentiality, and the interviewees were able to withdraw from participation \nat any time. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality we have used \n 10 \npseudonyms throughout the research, to disguise the identities of community \nmembers and our research participants.  \n \nThe data were analysed through thematic content analysis using a grounded \ntheory approach (see Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Charmaz, 2000). The process \nof analysis explored the data in order to answer two key questions. First, \n\u2018What do youth want in life and what pathways do they see to achieving this?\u2019 \nThis section of the findings includes data from both sets of interviews (i.e. in \n2004 and 2008). And second, \u2018To what extent did the project succeed or fail to \nresonate with these life goals?\u2019 This section reflects data from only the second \nset of interviews in 2008. The themes that emerged in response to these \nquestions form the subheadings in the findings section.  \n \nFindings and discussion \n \nWhat did the youth want in life and what pathways did they see to \nachieving this? \nThe young people\u2019s views of what they wanted in life clustered around three \nthemes: 1) jobs and success, 2) involvement in community affairs, and 3) \nhaving fun.  \n \nJobs and success \nWith high levels of poverty and unemployment in Entabeni, many young \npeople said their primary goals were to find a job (often phrased as \u2018making \nmoney\u2019) and to achieve career success. Many said Entabeni offered few \nopportunities to achieve this. Agricultural work was described as seasonal, \npiecemeal work providing little money, and was looked down upon by many \nyoung people as a \u2018dead-end\u2019 career. In a focus group discussion where the \noption of cutting sugarcane was mentioned, the in-school youths burst out \nlaughing. When asked why, one male responded: \u2018I think we are laughing \nbecause working in the cane fields is very stressful and tiring. You have to \nwork long hours for a small amount of money.\u2019 \n \n 11 \nThe few better jobs that existed in Entabeni were seen to go to those who had \n\u2018connections,\u2019 typically to the local traditional leadership. One example the \nyoung people gave was of a government-sponsored road-building \nprogramme, where izinDuna secured all the paying jobs for themselves and \ntheir families: \nInterviewer: You told me how it is living in this community. Can you now \ntell me the worst thing about living in this community? \nOut-of-school youth (female [F]): Ha! What can I say? The worst thing \nis that here there are no job opportunities. What I have noticed here, \nthere is a lot of nepotism. I will make an example of the road \nconstruction. Traditional leaders were asked to select one person from \neach family. But in the end, they only told their own family members \nand friends.  \nMore generally the young people said they were unlikely to secure jobs in \nEntabeni as these would usually go to adults: \n\u2018Another problem we have in the community is most of the time youth \nare excluded if there are job opportunities. Adults claim young people \ncannot tolerate the pressure of work because of their age\u2019 (male \nlearner). \nGiven the limited opportunities for employment that young people faced in \nEntabeni, almost all emphasized that young people needed to leave Entabeni \nfor urban areas if they wanted to find work: \n\u2018This is a quiet community, so young people have a problem of not \ngetting employed anywhere. Young people like to go out of the \ncommunity where they can get employment and then come back now \nand then. The problem here is that if you want to get a job you have to \nmove out of the community\u2019 (male learner).  \n \nThe young people identified a number of ways in which they saw themselves \nsecuring jobs. For many, education was a primary route through which they \ncould secure employment: \nInterviewer: What do you want to achieve in this community as young \npeople?  \n 12 \nLearner (F): I think the most important tool is to go to school, get \neducated and find employment. By doing that we will be in charge of \nour lives. \nTertiary education was seen as the surest route to success. When \ninterviewees were asked about people they knew who were successful, the \nstories they related were primarily about people who had left Entabeni to \nstudy at a university, which led to a job: \nInterviewer: Can you tell me of a person here in your community who \nhas been successful in what they have been doing? \nOut-of-school youth (F): Yes, I know of someone who is a social worker \nnearby. She finished school when I was doing Standard 5. She lives \nacross the road. When she finished her matric [high school], she \nstudied very hard to be a social worker, and when she finished she \ndidn\u2019t find a job. She did not give up. Eventually she found one and is \nnow very successful.  \n \nMany of the young people recognised they lacked basic skills needed for \noffice jobs and suggested that if they received training in these skills they \ncould secure a job: \nLearner (F): There are many young people here who would like to do \ncomputer courses and have technical skills. \nInterviewer: How would it help the youth to have computer skills? \nLearner (F): They will be taught how to use them and then get \ncertificates that will qualify them to get jobs in nearby towns. \n \nMany also said they needed \u2018networking\u2019 \u2014 links with people outside Entabeni \n\u2014 if they were to get jobs; this would provide them with information about \nopportunities for further education or skills training: \nLearner 1 (male [M]): What can help us is to be able to network with \nexperienced people who can advise us on skills development.  \nLearner 2 (F): I also think we should network with other people who can \ntell us how to get bursaries. As we are doing Grade 12 [school-leaving \nyear], we don\u2019t know what will happen next year. We need advice from \n 13 \nthose who can tell us which companies to contact for support. Most of \nus are from poor families who don\u2019t have such knowledge. \n \nFor these young people success was closely related to having a good job \noutside of Entabeni. Education, skills training, and networking were all specific \nways in which they saw themselves as being able to secure such a job.  \n \nInvolvement in community affairs \nThe youths also expressed the desire to become more involved in community \naffairs. They said they were systematically excluded from meaningful \ninvolvement in community affairs and sidelined in discussions that occurred in \nEntabeni: \nInterviewer: Can you tell me what young people in this community \nwould like to achieve? \nOut-of-school youth (F): I believe that young people should be active in \nthe community. That makes life interesting. I have heard that there is \ngoing to be a bakery somewhere in the community. It would be much \nbetter if the youth could be involved in that project. I am telling you they \nwill not take even a single young person. \nInterviewer: Why do you say that? \nOut-of-school youth (F): I am saying this from experience. As I am \ntalking to you, you would find that there are people already that have \nbeen contacted. Young people do not get any opportunities in this \ncommunity. \n \nAt times when these young people had taken the initiative to become more \ninvolved in the community and shape their lives there, they often felt ignored. \nLearners at the high school told how they had sent student representatives to \ntalk to the principal, but nothing changed: \nInterviewer: Don\u2019t you have an SRC [student representative council]?  \nLearner (M): We don\u2019t have an SRC. We only have class \nrepresentatives. When we send a representative with our complaints, \nthe teacher concerned continues to do what we complained about. We \n 14 \nhave decided not to do anything because even the principal does not \ndo anything. He only says we must \u2018concentrate on our studies.\u2019 \n \nThe young people\u2019s desire for greater involvement in community affairs was \noften framed within a rights-based discourse, emerging post-1994 with the \nformal end of the apartheid regime. This was contrasted with the \u2018style\u2019 of \nleadership that existed in Entabeni, which continued to deny them any \nmeaningful involvement: \nLearner 1 (M): They are ruling with old fashion.  \nLearner 2 (M): They are still undermining young people. According to \nthem, young people have no rights. \nYet despite systematic exclusion from community affairs, some felt they could \nbecome more involved \u2014 if adults, and especially leaders, were encouraged \nto recognise young people\u2019s legitimacy as active members of the community: \nInterviewer: What do you think can help you to achieve all these things \nyou have in mind? \nOut-of-school youth (F): In this community, nothing is done without the \nknowledge of the inkosi. I feel he is the first person who should support \nus. He should be involved in all the things that young people want to \ndo. \nWhile some young people were positive about the possibilities of greater \ninvolvement in community affairs, one set of learners were dismissive, arguing \nthings would not change and the only option was to leave: \nInterviewer: Why do you think young people leave the area once they \nfinish matric [high school]? \nLearner (M): I think young people are trying to find a place where they \ncan use their knowledge. In Entabeni they won\u2019t get a chance to use \ntheir knowledge. If they try, people will say they are getting too clever \nfor their own good. That is why young people move out from Entabeni \nafter they complete school, so they can get good jobs or further their \neducation.  \nThe youths framed their desire for greater involvement in community affairs \nwithin a rights-based discourse, contrasting this starkly with the actual role \nthey felt they were accorded. While some were cautiously optimistic about \n 15 \nbecoming more involved in community affairs, others were sceptical, \nsuggesting greater involvement in community affairs was not possible and the \nonly solution was to leave for an urban area.  \n \nHaving fun \nAnother thing that the young people wanted in life was to \u2018have fun.\u2019 While \nthere were many understandings of what this meant, one theme emphasised \nby the youths was participation in one of the numerous sports or activity clubs \nthat existed:  \nInterviewer: What do young people enjoy doing in this community? \nLearner (F): This is a rural community. People here enjoy getting \ntogether and doing traditional dancing and singing. For them that is fun. \nAnother key aspect of fun for young people was their involvement in a thriving \nsexual sub-culture, conducted with secrecy and great enthusiasm beyond \nadults\u2019 awareness. In our early research in Entabeni (Campbell et al., 2008a; \nCampbell et al., 2009), many adults (including traditional leaders, parents and \nthe principal of the local high school) told us there was no need to involve \nyouths in an HIV\/AIDS project since Entabeni was dominated by traditional \nconservative mores, where young women guarded their virginity, which was \n\u2018checked\u2019 annually by older women at traditional reed-dance ceremonies that \ncelebrated the chastity of local virgins. However, a minority of adults \nemphasized the hypocrisy of adults who refused to acknowledge youths\u2019 \nsexuality, pointing to increasing numbers of teenage pregnancies and AIDS-\nrelated deaths among youths. Furthermore, young people spoke openly about \ntheir interest and involvement in sex, saying it was a natural and unavoidable \nbiological drive and a source of great pleasure and excitement for them. For \nexample, in a nine-person focus group with out-of-school youths, eight youths \nsaid they were sexually active and none had used a condom.  \n \nTo what extent did the project succeed or fail to resonate with the \nyouths\u2019 life goals? \nInterviews suggested that the activities the Entabeni Project had organised \nand facilitated had some resonance with what young people wanted out of \nlife. Three themes emerged in the young peoples\u2019 discussions of the \n 16 \nachievements of the project: 1) spaces to speak about HIV\/AIDS, 2) \ninvolvement in the project and community, and 3) skills training.  \n \nSpaces to speak about HIV\/AIDS \nThe young people were very happy with the opportunity to talk about \nHIV\/AIDS which involvement in the project afforded them, but which they were \nrarely allowed otherwise: \nInterviewer: Can you tell me what you gain from these peer-education \nclasses? \nLearner (M): I must say that we have learnt a lot from Mr Nzama [NGO \nworker running the classes]. He has taught us a lot about infectious \ndiseases, especially STIs. \nLearner (F): We have benefited a lot from these classes. We know now \nthat we cannot risk our lives by having unprotected sex.  \n \nAs already stated above, many of these young people were sexually active in \na context where opportunities to get information about sexual health were \ndramatically restricted by adults\u2019 denial of youths\u2019 sexuality. Opportunities for \nopen and frank dialogue are crucial if young people are to gain the correct \ninformation about HIV and AIDS and also integrate it into their lives \n(Campbell, 2003).  \n \nInvolvement in the project and community \nThe project had provided spaces for four young people to become more \ninvolved. One very involved out-of-school youth explained how it had provided \nher with opportunities to get involved in the community in ways that did not \nexist before: \n\u2018What I enjoy most is that now we have many opportunities where we \ncan involve ourselves. When the Entabeni Health Partnership started, \nmany doors were opened for me.\u2019  \nThe opportunities she spoke of included the four out-of-school youths running \nan HIV\/AIDS-training programme at a local primary school, which motivated \nthem to become more involved in the Entabeni Project and wider community: \n 17 \nInterviewer: Can you tell me what can encourage young people to \nparticipate in fighting HIV? \nOut-of-school youth (F): It was wonderful when we were able to visit \nthe school and contribute to AIDS training. We weren\u2019t paid for this \nwork, but I enjoyed it.  \nInterviewer: What motivated you to continue though you were not \ngetting paid? \nOut-of-school youth (F): You know, just standing in front of a class and \nteaching kids about HIV and other things was very motivating. \nThe Entabeni Project had provided these four out-of-school youths with real \nopportunities to become involved in community affairs. \n \nSkills training \nThe project also provided the same four young people with additional skills \ntraining, which they saw as a way of securing jobs in the future: \n\u2018I have been trained on being a counsellor by the project, and people \nknow about this in this community. I have a training certificate and \nwhen I look for a job, I will have proof in my CV that I have achieved \nthis and other project courses, and it will be easy to get employment. I \nmay get a job as a counsellor in a firm or doing first aid on employees \nthat get injured at work\u2019 (female out-of-school youth).  \n \nThe additional training and opportunities for greater involvement in the \ncommunity and opportunities to speak about HIV\/AIDS resonated closely with \nwhat young people in Entabeni said they wanted out of life. However, as \nalready stated, the number of young people who actively participated in the \nproject never really numbered more than four very involved out-of-school \nyouths, far short of the 70\u2013100 we had envisaged. \n \nWays in which the project did not resonate with the young people \nOur analysis of the data identified five themes reflecting ways in which the \nproject failed to resonate with what young people wanted: 1) lack of financial \nincentives, 2) conflicting priorities for in-school youths, 3) adult domination of \n 18 \nthe project, 4) lack of recognition for young people as legitimate actors, and 5) \nlimited networking opportunities.  \n \nLack of financial incentives \nA key issue that limited the young people\u2019s participation in the project was the \nlack of financial incentives. Given the high level of poverty and young people\u2019s \ndesire to secure a job to support themselves and their families, the lack of \npayment or reward for participation was cited as a major barrier for many: \nInterviewer: So what caused people to drop out? They started dropping \nout soon after the counselling training began and continued to drop \nout? \nOut-of-school youth (F): Though I might not have the right answer, I \nthink people were not really committed to the training. They were not \nsure what the training was about. Some initially thought they would get \nfast cash if they participated, but dropped out once they realised this \nwas not to be\u2026some were not really interested in doing voluntary work \nwhile their families were hungry. \nThe project had decided that financial incentives would not be provided for \nyoung people, given the lack of sustainability of such funding and the \nproblems this can cause (Bhattacharyya, Winch, LeBan & Tien, 2001). \nInstead, other incentives were constructed, revolving around building young \npeople\u2019s leadership skills through additional training and trips to important \nmeetings outside of Entabeni. These alternative incentives were not clearly \nset out at the start of the project, but evolved as it developed; but as these \nopportunities became apparent, they were monopolised by the four out-of-\nschool youths who were particularly involved.  \n \nConflicting priorities for in-school youths \nMany of the young people identified education as a main route to securing a \njob, and many learners felt the time spent with peer-education training \nconflicted with this. The training was held after school (the time the principal \nhad allocated), limiting the youths\u2019 participation as they often had to walk far to \nget home and had little spare time given their school work: \n 19 \n\u2018I think I can do voluntary work but the problem is that as I am still at \nschool, it is not easy to find time to do that. From school we have to \nwalk long distances and when we reach home we have to study. On \nweekends we also have to come to school. That is my main problem\u2019 \n(male learner). \nThe peer-education training offered learners little support for their wider \nobjectives in life: finishing their high school education, going onto university \nand securing a good job. As such they were highly reluctant to get involved.  \n \nAdult domination of the project \nThe project failed to create what Cornish (2006) would call \u2018micro spaces\u2019 in \nwhich young people could become involved in the leadership of the project \u2014 \nand in turn gain confidence, skills, and credibility in the eyes of adults to \nparticipate meaningfully in wider community affairs. Despite extensive \nattempts by project staff to create such spaces, much of the project was \ndominated by several older men who wielded a great deal of authority in the \nEntabeni community in general as well as encroached on the Entabeni \nProject.  \n \nThe youth rally held in 2004 (discussed above) is a clear example of adult \nmen monopolising a potential micro space created to encourage youth \nparticipation, leadership and more general empowerment. The adults\u2019 \n\u2018abstinence-only\u2019 message during the event strongly diluted the potential \nimpact of the rally on young people who were already sexually active and \nunwilling to abstain, and imposed an adult agenda on a supposedly youth-led \nand youth-appropriate event (Campbell et al., 2007).  \n \nSimilarly, some comments made during interviews suggested that the training \nof out-of-school youths in counselling skills also failed to provide a micro \nspace beyond the gaze of adults. The selection process was supervised by Mr \nMzobe, an older man who dominated the management of the Entabeni \nProject. Subsequently he had attended many training sessions, usually giving \nlong authoritarian speeches complaining about young people\u2019s poor \n 20 \nattendance and about their need to be enthusiastic. As one fieldworker\u2019s diary \nreported: \n\u2018Mr Mzobe made a long speech about the training, saying the trainees \nmust behave themselves properly through the training. He said that if \nthey did not, this would set a very bad example to other youth, and to \nthe community, and the inkosi would not take it lightly. He stressed that \nthe NGO was brought to the community by HIVAN and that he would \nnot want to hear that the members of the group had done anything to \nundermine these two groups\u2019 presence in the community. He made \nthem aware that this would be taken in a very serious light.\u2019 \nWe speculate that this tone countered the project\u2019s attempts to give youths a \nsense of ownership of the training, and instead served to frame training as a \n\u2018top-down\u2019 matter in which youths\u2019 behaviour would be strictly policed by \nadults, and where misdemeanours would be reported to the inkosi. The \ntendency by adult men to \u2018hijack\u2019 the spaces for youths which the project \nsought to create, limited the potential for these to support youth leadership; \nwe also speculate that this contributed to the sense of disaffection underlying \nthe high drop-out rate for the course. \n \nLack of recognition for young people as legitimate actors in the community \nElsewhere we have written about a prevailing low level of respect for youths \nand a lack of recognition of their value in a context where young people tend \nto be regarded as \u2018mad, bad or deviant\u2019 (Campbell et al., 2005). Likewise, the \nyoung people involved in the Entabeni Project often had their views sidelined \nand ignored. This is despite the extensive effort HIVAN placed on working \nwith key adult male leaders to encourage them to recognise young people as \nlegitimate actors and that young people\u2019s views were give equal weight in the \nproject. Moreover, there seemed to be no change in the wider community as \nsome of the peer educators told us they still struggled to have their knowledge \nand expertise recognised as legitimate: \n\u2018The main difficulty in talking about HIV\/AIDS to members of this \ncommunity is that, when you talk about it, especially to old people, they \ndon\u2019t understand why you are talking about it. Say for instance I talk to \nthe congregation at my church. They will just stare at me as if I am not \n 21 \nthere. They dismiss whatever you are, saying \u2014 Young people are \nanother problem\u2019 (male learner).  \nAdults\u2019 negative views of young people persisted throughout the project, and \nthis thwarted young people from becoming more involved in community \naffairs.  \n \nLimited networking opportunities \nAnother theme emerging from the data was that young people felt the project \ndid not create strong enough networks with external organisations, otherwise \nidentified by the youths as a key way to progress in life. Elsewhere we have \nreported on the project\u2019s difficulties in developing long-lasting and supportive \nrelationships with external organisations (Nair & Campbell, 2008); the young \npeople spoke of how the networks introduced to support them, failed to do so. \n \nIn particular, the youths were particularly disappointed by the performance of \nthe external NGO that had committed to providing ongoing support and \ntraining; the youths said this had failed to materialise in any satisfactory way: \nInterviewer: The objective of having the outreach centre was to make a \nplace where young people would come and start doing things or where \nthey could access information. Why do you think that didn\u2019t happen as \nplanned? \nOut-of-school youth (F): I think the main reason for that is that even \nthough some of the counsellors were trained, it took a very long time \nfor the NGO to give them the certificates they had promised. Some of \nus did not want to volunteer for a long time, which is what happened\u2026. \nAlso the NGO had said counsellors would be trained continuously, \nwhich didn\u2019t happen. Some of the youth were interested to join the \nsecond group the NGO had promised to organise, but that didn\u2019t \nhappen. Some even filled in the forms they brought to the community, \nbut nothing happened. \n \nPeer educators also reported that they received little support from the NGO \nfor running peer-education classes at their school. With limited external \nrelationships available for young people, and those which were available not \n 22 \nbeing particularly strong, this did not match closely with what the young \npeople wanted out of life.  \n \nConclusions \n \nA fundamental goal of the Entabeni Project was to facilitate youth \nparticipation. While the project was very successful in engaging, training and \nsupporting four out-of-school youths, it was not successful in its greater aim of \ninvolving 70\u2013100 young people.  \n \nIn this section we use Pawson & Tilley\u2019s (1997) formula \u2018Programme + \nContext = Outcome\u2019 to explain young people\u2019s level of participation. The main \n\u2018programme\u2019 factor of relevance concerned the various levels of support \nprovided to the young people by different project-related agencies. Ongoing \nsupport by external agencies is recognised as very important in ensuring \nsuccessful outcomes for youth-led projects (Campbell, 2003; Maticka-Tyndale \n& Barnett, 2010). However, the external agencies involved in supporting the \nEntabeni Project in different ways (e.g. home-nursing training versus peer \neducation versus counselling training) varied enormously in the amount of \nactual support they were able to give the youth participants.  \n \nTwo representatives of HIVAN had close contact with the four young women \nwho were actively involved in the home-based care part of the project; the \nHIVAN representatives provided them with continual mentoring and guidance. \nThey counselled them through a range of personal and project-related \nchallenges, often on the telephone in the evening and on weekends, as well \nas during their formal community visits. They worked to build the young \nwomen\u2019s confidence, ensuring that their views were taken seriously in project \nmeetings. Thus, for example, they gave a great deal of counselling support to \na young project participant who was heavily ostracised by the other women in \nthe home-based care team when she had an unplanned pregnancy (despite \nhaving loudly pledged to use condoms at all times), working with her to \nconstructively manage her \u2018loss of face\u2019 in the group. \n \n 23 \nFor the young people involved in project activities facilitated by other external \nagencies, however, such a degree of personal support was not available. For \nexample, the external NGO that trained youths in peer education skills did not \nhave the capacity to provide one-on-one support, which could have helped \nsustain young people\u2019s interest and confidence about their contributions. \nOngoing support by external agencies appears to be crucial in facilitating \nsuccessful youth participation. \n \nTaking into consideration the context within which the project sought to \nmobilise youths, to what extent did the project offer opportunities that \nresonated with young people\u2019s social identities and future aspirations? The \nfindings presented so far highlight ways in which the project unintentionally \nevolved and which conflicted with young people\u2019s social identities and future \naspirations, therefore undermining their participation. \n \nA key rationale of the Entabeni Project was to develop strategies and \napproaches appropriate for its rural setting, rather than to impose imported \nsolutions and methods. However, the project\u2019s strong local and rural identity \nhad the unintended effect of alienating many young people whose views of \nthe future focused on moving to urban areas as quickly as possible, and who \nassociated the rural areas with personal stagnation and boredom. \nFurthermore, the volunteer nature of the work held little appeal for young \npeople who saw paid work as their way out of poverty or for ambitious \nscholars who were reluctant to take unpaid time out from schoolwork.  \n \nIn contrast, the four young people who became highly involved in the project \ndid not have these aspirations. They were very much committed to living and \nworking in Entabeni because of family commitments and they had a long \nhistory of involvement in the local health volunteers\u2019 programme. As such, \ntheir wider aspirations in life did not include leaving Entabeni, and for various \nreasons involvement in the project was more consonant with their life plans \nand goals.  \n \n 24 \nThese contrasting levels of youth participation highlight how youths\u2019 identity is \nnot homogenous, even in such a small and clearly demarcated rural area, but \nis constructed within specific networks and relationships, shaping young \npeople\u2019s social identities and aspirations. Our observations draw attention to \nthe danger of the tendency of projects to identify and target an assumedly \nhomogenous group called \u2018youths.\u2019 Either programmes need to identify the \nmultiplicity of youth identities, and accommodate these through different \nactivities and outreach methods, or, as Greig (2009) notes, the projects need \nto put a great deal of effort into identifying where different youth identities \nconverge and tailor specific programmes to resonate with these. Either way, it \nis crucial that programme designers understand the complexity of young \npeople\u2019s motivations and aspirations and the differences that exist among \nthem and match these with appropriate incentives and approaches to support \nparticipation by the variety of youth groups that exist even in relatively \ngrounded local areas.  \n \nMore widely, another factor at the level of \u2018context\u2019 which may have \nundermined youth participation and ownership was that the project became \nmired in traditional, adult-dominated social relations, rather than creating \ndemocratic micro spaces for youth participation (cf. Campbell & MacPhail, \n2000). The project\u2019s narrow focus on abstinence-only approaches to HIV \nprevention illustrates this point. This held little interest for young people who \ntook an enthusiastic interest in sex. The rigid top-down inter-generational \nrelationships that characterised the Entabeni project and community, as well \nas adults\u2019 strong denial of youths\u2019 sexuality, limited the development of any \nsignificant social space in which youths and adults could engage in frank \ndialogue about the realities of their lives and the need for a more open-minded \nacceptance of well-established youth norms. It is critical to develop a good \nunderstanding of how to facilitate equal relationships between young people \nand adults, ensuring that adult domination does not occur and that young \npeople are seen as legitimate actors (Ramella & De la Cruz, 2000; Percy-\nSmith, 2007). Vaughan (forthcoming) suggests a need for research that \nconcentrates on what she calls the \u2018in-between\u2019 spaces where young people \nand adults come together, focusing on how these spaces can be used in ways \n 25 \nthat enable greater recognition of the value and potential contributions of \nyouths.  \n \nThe findings presented here highlight the deep contradictions inherent in \nprogrammes that seek to facilitate local community responses to HIV\/AIDS. \nAs discussed, the starting assumption of the Entabeni Project was a critique \nof programmes imposed by outside professionals on passive communities, \nand the belief that programmes were more likely to succeed if they identified \nand strengthened existing community responses. In this regard, HIVAN strove \nto play a non-directive role allowing the project to develop as local people saw \nappropriate. This however led to a situation where the project became \ndominated by the very adult- and male-dominated social-relations which many \nwould say are key drivers of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in the first place, and \nwhich make women and young people particularly vulnerable to infection \n(Campbell et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 2009).  \n \nWhat strategies exist for creating micro spaces for youth participation \n(Cornish, 2006)? These will increase the likelihood that projects will resonate \nwith young people\u2019s social identities. Researchers increasingly focus on novel \nparticipant-led action research methods, such as Photovoice (Moletsane, De \nLange, Mitchell, Stuart, Buthelezi & Taylor, 2007; Vaughan, forthcoming). \nSuch approaches provide techniques through which young people can identify \ntheir own priorities, and add to individuals\u2019 understandings of health and \nwellbeing, often stepping beyond narrow adult or professional-oriented \ndefinitions of health (Percy-Smith, 2007; Vaughan, forthcoming). Ideally such \napproaches serve as a springboard for social action, tackling issues identified \nby young people in ways that young people feel are appropriate to their own \nself-defined needs and interests (Skovdal, forthcoming).  \n \nThere are no easy solutions to problems rooted in the intricately complex \nconstruction of age and gender relations in post-apartheid South Africa. \nHowever, we hope that our account of the Entabeni Project\u2019s difficulties in \nsupporting young people will contribute to critical debates about contradictions \nat the heart of so-called \u2018social development\u2019 programmes in highly \n 26 \nmarginalised communities, and how these might be best undertaken to open \nup health-enabling possibilities for youths.  \n \nNotes  \n \n1The provincial branches of the Department of Local Government and \nTraditional Affairs are the sphere of government closest to communities. \nDistrict municipalities are responsible for development planning in \ncommunities, and these are further sub-divided into local municipalities, one \nof which services Entabeni. \n2A community is usually defined as a group of people who share a common \nsocial identity or a group who live in a common geographical space. In \npractice (for reasons relating to place-based resource allocation and \nconvenience) health interventions usually target geographically defined \ncommunities. This is particularly the case in geographically remote areas such \nas the one discussed here. Accordingly, the Entabeni Project used a place-\nbased notion of community to frame its work. \n \nAcknowledgments \u2014 thanks are due to Prof. Eleanor Preston-Whyte and \nDebbie Heustice of the Centre for HIV\/AIDS Networking (HIVAN) who enabled \nthis project, and to the two anonymous reviewers who gave perceptive \ncomments on this paper.
