INTRODUCTION  \nRolling is an important steel manufacturing process to provide a wide range of products \nused in the automotive, construction, and engineering industries. However, due to \nincreasing competition in the steel industry, there is an ever-increasing demand on the \nsteel manufacturers to become more flexible, more responsive and to be competitive \nwith energy efficiency. The competition is fierce, complex products are being required \nat higher quality for the same cost and margins are continuously being squeezed. \nOptimal rolling system designs can play a significant role in dealing with these \nchallenges. Motivated by the need to enhance new products and process development \nstrategies to deliver a spectrum of high quality design solutions at low cost, the steel \nindustry is increasingly adopting scientific approaches in favour of traditional \napproaches. Several algorithmic optimisation approaches are emerging as alternative \nsolutions to deal with the complex search space properties of the real world process \nproblems. \nRolling system design (RSD) is a complex problem due to the non-deterministic nature \nof the process and the large number of processing conditions involved. It is a core skill \noften conducted by experts using their experience and intuition. These procedures are \nlargely based on trial and error and can be expensive and time consuming. It can \nsignificantly influence the ability to deliver new products to the markets. The overall \naim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of process optimisation \napproaches for solving the rolling system design problem. The paper provides a \ndescription of the features of a rolling system design and critically analyse the \napproaches to a rolling system design. The study looks at Quantitative (QT) and \nQualitative (QL) information involved in the design. The review is classified into the \nfollowing areas: approximate QT models, approximate QL models, manual search \nmethods, QL and QT optimisation, soft computing approaches in RSD, and multi-pass \nRSD. For each classification, the review explores how the reported techniques search \nfor good RSD solutions in terms of efficiency and cost. The paper then critically \nanalyses how such strategies contribute to developing timely low cost solutions that are \noptimal for the steel industry. The paper also explores soft computing based techniques \nas an emerging technology for a more structured optimisation of an RSD.  \nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2  introduces RSD by identifying and \nclassifying the features of RSD while section 3 presents a comprehensive review of the \nRSD approaches over the years. Section 4 discusses the challenges of RSD as an \noptimisation problem and evaluates RSD in relation to new product development \nstrategies. Finally, section 5 presents a summary of the reviewed approaches and \nconcludes with an outline of the future research directions.  \n \n2. ROLLING SYSTEM DESIGN \nRolling system design is the preparation of a series of roll pockets and draughting \nsequences for roll passes that are necessary to obtain a group of roll profiles. The \npurpose of RSD is to ensure the correct production of roll profiles within the constraints \nof the mill with acceptable qualities, minimum cost [1] and maximum output. This \nproblem can also be referred to as a multi-pass search problem for multiple passes. \nEffective RSD aims to achieve the optimum number of passes with the desired \ngeometry avoiding roll defects whilst maximising the reduction in the cross section area \nper pass. This is normally achieved by considering the geometrical, mechanical, \nthermal, thermo-mechanical and metallurgical behaviours of the entire rolling system \n[2] (see Figure 1). \nROLLING\nSYSTEM\nCOOLING\nafter rolling\nTemperature\nStresses\nGrain size\nSurface quality\nROLL PASS\nDESIGN\nShape\nMetallurgy\nResidual stresses\nSoundness\nTemperature\nDeformation resistance\nReduction ratio\nOxidation\nTemperature\nconditions\nDecarburisation\nREHEATING\nDefects\nGrain size\nComposition\nCleanliness \ninclusions\nSTEELMAKING\nFriction\ncoefficient\nRolling\/Mill\nEntry\/delivery\nconditions\nDescaling\nMesh size\nRun time\nMODELLING\n3D vs 2D\nElement aspect \nMass Scaling\nElement distortion\nElement type\nShape\nSegregation\nCASTING\nSoundness\nGrain size\nStructure\nINTERSTAND\nOPERATIONS\nStructure\nInterpass time\nStock cooling\nroll force, \ntorque, power\nMILL \nENGINEERING\nThermal camber\nMill spring\nRoll effects\nMill stretch\nMill modulus\nShape\nTexture\nSTRAIGHTENING\nResidual stresses\nResearch\n Focus\n \nFigure 1: Fishbone Diagram of  the Rolling System  \nThe rolling system as a whole is multidisciplinary in nature consisting of reheating, \ninter-stand operations, mill engineering, roll pass design, straightening etc. Figure 1 \nshows a fishbone diagram that classifies the rolling system components for this paper. \nThe fishbone diagram was developed by the authors in collaboration with rolling system \nengineers and by reviewing the literature [1]. It is also important to note that in rolling \nsystem analysis it is also common to include the influence of historical behaviours from \nsteelmaking and casting processes. The rolling system components are classified under \ngeneral headings to show how the individual components of the complex system can be \ndecomposed. It should be noted that the relationships amongst each individual \ncomponents are not mutually exclusive but in fact a complex interaction of these \ncomponents forms the inherent source of the rolling system complexity. Figure 1 shows \nhow the highly complex nature of the rolling system is composed of the product and \nprocess that interact with multifaceted disciplines. The RSD problem is an important \ncomponent of the rolling process. The following sections introduce RSD and identifies \nthe challenges posed by the RSD optimisation. \n2.1. Features of Rolling System Design Problems \nRSD problems like most real world process problems can be characterised as having \nchaotic disturbances, randomness, and complex non-linear dynamics. This is due to the \nelastic-plastic material behaviour and potentially large deformation behaviour [3]. It is \nwidely accepted that the rolling processes are usually large scale, highly dimensional, \nnon-linear, highly uncertain and involves complex interaction of highly experienced \nengineers to apply empirical design knowledge to develop roll schedules [4]. Some of \nthe main considerations of RSD problems are listed below, and are summarised in  \nFigure 2. \n \nFigure 2: Features of Rolling System Design Problem \nSearch Space \nRSD can be formulated as a process optimisation problem, where the search space \nrepresents all possible designs. Here, processing parameters can be chosen to maximise \nproductivity, minimise product defect subject to the complex synergies between the \nmaterial flow, composition, thermal dependencies, and intricate interactions between the \ndraughting section rolling. Like most real-world process optimisation problems, RSD \nposes significant challenges for traditional optimisation algorithms. The main features \nof the problem space is summarised in this section using the classification given by [5]. \nThe complexity of the search space is due to the number and nature of objectives and \nconstraints. The presence of multiple hard constraints significantly affects the \nperformance of any optimization algorithm including evolutionary search methods [6] \nmaking it difficult to find optimal solutions. The objective and constraint functions can \nbe non-smooth, severely non-linear, discontinuous or even ill-defined\/undefined in \nsome region of the parameter space [7]. The existence of several local extrema (multi-\nmodality) is also quite common. Most real-world process problems also have very large \nnumber of parameters resulting in exponential increase in interactions [8]. This effect \nwas described by [9] as the \u2018Curse of Dimensionality\u2019. The search space can also be \nquantitative (QT) or qualitative (QL) in nature or both [10]. QT describes the behaviour \nof the problem using suitable numerical terms. However, this can be incomplete and \neven there are certain behaviours (e.g. manufacturability) which are not easily described \nusing analytical means. In such cases human based reasoning can be formulated into \nrules for QL models to express such behaviours. \nThe following paragraph explores some of the RSD features that are likely to influence \noptimisation algorithms. This also demonstrates that the RSD is similar to other process \noptimisation problems. \nMulti-staged \nBy definition, multiple passes is an ordered multi-stage process. This is similar to the \nsequential process described for process problems where the output stock of one mill \nstand is fed as input stock into the subsequent mill stand. Solving the sequential design \nproblem increases the problem size (number of variables), introduces hierarchical \nsearch space problems and relationship between passes. These relationships are \nexpressed in terms of variables, parameters, objective and constraints. The nature of the \nproblem can be static or dynamic, QT, QL or semi-QT depending on the level of \nknowledge available. These features present several challenges for an algorithmic \napproach to the process optimisation. \nHierarchical \nThe optimisation of a rolling system is a hierarchical problem in which different \ncompeting technological and quality objectives have to be solved at each level of \noptimisation [11]. For instance, at the top levels, productivity of the rolling mill is one \nof many issues to be considered, while at lower levels, for example, the determination \nof the number of passes and the form of grooves must be obtained ([12], [13], [14]). A \nparameter or an objective function can also be of singular or multiple hierarchical level \nin nature. For example a geometrical parameter might be of lower level such as CAD \nentities, or of a higher abstract level such as feature-based, or might be a switch between \nboth. It is observed that roll designs switch levels in this way within the current \nunstructured design process. \nMulti-disciplinary \nRSD is characterised by complex interactions occurring amongst various disciplines. \nFor example, material flow\/composition, thermal, pass design, mill capabilities, inter-\nstand dependencies, and process controls all combine to determine the shape and \nproperty of the product. Combining different models across various disciplines have an \nimportant influence on the optimisation algorithm. It is necessary to ensure models have \nequivalent scales  so that they can be integrated and the optimisation algorithm can be \nutilised. \nMultidimensional \nRSD is characterised by various process and product variables such as forming \nsequence, shape evolution, forming speed, reduction ratio, temperature distribution, \nfriction conditions, thermal and mechanical conditions of the work-piece and the die \n[15]. \nQualitative Knowledge in Rolling System Design \nRolling system design is a knowledge intensive task and can be qualitative (QL) in  \nnature [16]. Traditional RSD has been undertaken by individual experts using a mixture \nof empirical knowledge, based on sound engineering and rolling practices acquired over \nmany years of experience. This knowledge is not always explicit and is not so easy to \ncapture such knowledge for generic re-use. In many instances, there are no clear rules to \ndesign a particular pass shape [17]. They tend to be too specific and it is difficult to \ndecouple the process, product and mill engineering knowledge [18].  \n \n3. ROLLING SYSTEM DESIGN APPROACHES  \nThis section presents a comprehensive review of approaches for dealing with RSD \nproblems in terms of modelling and optimisation. This section presents a critical \nanalysis of the RSD optimisation approaches in terms of developing approximate QT \nmodels and approximate QL models, manual search methods, handling QL information, \nmulti-pass optimisation problems, and Soft Computing approaches in RSD. \n3.1. Approximate QT Modelling Methods \nSection 2.1 stated that a pre-requisite to any optimisation problem is the availability of a \nprocess model. This is required to evaluate the quality of a given solution. Since \nphysical experimentation is slow, expensive and disrupts production runs, approximate \nQT models are developed to represent the process behaviour so that off-line studies can \nbe carried out in order to gain better understanding of the process. Several modelling \nmethods have been developed for simulating the behaviour of the rolling process. These \napproaches aim to find a suitable representation for the underlying process behaviour. \nThis section reviews the following QT based modelling approaches, classical rolling \ntheories, recent mathematical methods, finite element methods and approximate finite \nelement strategies.  \n3.1.1.Classical Rolling Theories on Load and Torque \nMuch efforts were devoted to develop theoretical model to predict roll pressure \ndistribution, rolling load, torque, yield stress of the material being rolled and the \ncoefficient of friction between the rolls and the material. Most rolling mathematical \nmodels of hot-strip rolling are concerned with the force of equilibrium of vertical cross-\nsections in the roll gap. Siebel [19] and Von Karman [20] in 1925 first introduced the \nconcept of homogeneous compression of vertical strip segments as they move through \nthe roll gap. These early authors made the fundamental assumptions of a neutral plane \ncross-section and a neutral point occurs along the contact arc between the rolls and the \ndeforming metal. Ekelund later developed a formula [21] (equation 2.1)  based on the \nstudy of material flow during plastic deformation. Ekelund\u2019s approach consisted of \ncontact area, friction hill factor and the yield stress. It was very popular in the early \nyears due to the embodiment of the essential rolling variables and it was considered to \nbe a convenient form for calculation. \n( ) ( ) ( )\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+\n\u2212\n+\u00d7\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+\n\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u00d7\u2212=\n21\n21\n21\n221\n21\n22.16.1\n1\nhh\nR\nhh\nJ\nhh\nhhhhR\nhhRwP m\n\u03bd\u03b5\u00b5\n Equation 3.1 \nwhere: P = rolling load, wm = mean width of the material in the arc of contact, h1 = \nheight of material before the pass, h= height of material after the pass, R = roll radius, \n\u03bd = peripheral velocity of the rolls at the bottom of the pass, \u00b5 = coefficient of friction \nbetween the materials and roll. Ekelund derived values of \u00b5 = 0.848 \u2013 0.000222tF from \nexperiments for steel rolls, tF = temperature of rolled material. \u03b5  = coefficient of \nviscosity derived as 0.01 (20164 \u2013 7.89tF), J is the static compressive strength of hot \nsteel derived as 100\u03b5 (1.4 + C + Mn + 0.3 Cr). Where C, Mn and Cr are the carbon, \nmanganese and chromium content of steel respectively. Limitations in Ekelund\u2019s \nformula are due to large approximations. According to Ekelund\u2019s formula, if the \ntemperature is increased to 1400\u00b0C, the yield stress would be equal to zero. This implies \nthat the rolled stock would begin to melt. A critical analysis of Ekelund\u2019s formula is \npresented by [1]. \nSiebel and Lueg [22] performed experimental studies on annealed aluminium and \nmeasured roll pressure distribution. Their results were used to compare early theories. \nOrowan [23] discarded most of the mathematical approximations and assumptions of \nthe rolling theories and developed the most comprehensive model. Orowan recognised \nthat the flow stress of the material varies in rolling due to the variation of effective \nstrain, effective strain rate and temperature and considered these variations in his model. \nOrowan also abandoned the assumptions of slipping friction and homogeneous \ncompression. He showed that the coefficient of friction can be sufficiently high for the \ntangential stress to reach the shear yield stress of the material and that the strip sticks to \nthe roll. He was interested in developing an accurate theory that can be used as a \nbenchmark for assessing simplified theories regardless of its complexity. Subsequently, \nseveral authors simplified the Orowan\u2019s model, notably [24]. Sims assumed sticking \nfriction over the whole arc of contact and made allowances for homogeneous \ndeformation. Sims\u2019s formula  shown in equation 3.2 consistently under-predicts values \npredicted by the Ekelund formula [21] [25]. \n( ) pQhhRKP .'. 21 \u2212=  Equation 3.2 \n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\n\u2212+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212= \u2212\nrh\nR\nr\nr\nh\nh\nh\nR\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nrQ Np 1\n1.ln'1\n2\n1.ln'1\n41\ntan1\n2 222\n1 \u03c0\u03c0\n Equation 3.3 \nwhere R\u2019 is radius of curvature of the elastically deformed roll, QP is a complex \nfunction of the roll gap given by equation 3.3, and \n1\n21\nh\nhhr \u2212= , h1 and h2 is the initial and \nfinal thickness of rolled strip respectively. \nClassical Rolling Theories: Observations \nAlthough applications of classical rolling theories have been relatively successful in \ndelivering roll design solutions, their limitations influence the RSD in terms of the \nquality of solutions, and poor response to a broad range of problems. They tend to be \nrelated to specific disciplines. Typical classical rolling theories tend to consider spread, \nelongation, and load. This limits the information obtainable from such methods since \nrolling processes are influenced by many more factors such as metallurgical and \nthermo-mechanical properties. Since limited number of rolling design variables are \nconsidered, this can result in unrealistic design solutions. \nSeveral authors ([26], [27], [28]) have investigated the performance of a number of \nclassical rolling theories and found that in most cases the rolling load and torque are \nseverely underestimated. Alexander [29] conducted experimental studies on annealed \ncopper strip with front tension and made comparison on earlier theories. It was \nconcluded that previous rolling theories were not capable of predicting the roll torque \nwith adequate precision. The fundamental stress equilibrium approach for which the \nrolling theories were based fails to take account of the non-homogeneity of the \ndeformation. For this reason, under-estimates of the rolling loads resulted in many \ncases. Most of the empirical rules tend to focus on flow mechanism related to spread \nand elongation for various roll groove geometries without considering the temperature \nand strain rate effects. Research efforts have focused on applying the Finite Element \nAnalysis (FEA) to the metal forming processes to address some of the above mentioned \nissues.  \n3.1.2.Finite Element Methods in RSD  \nThe concept of Finite Elements (FE) was originally introduced in the 1950\u2019s as a \nmethod of structural analysis for the aircraft industry [30]. Since then, it has evolved \nand its wide application covers various classes of metal forming problems such as \nrolling. The FE technique can be used to simulate the metal forming before performing \nactual experiments, which can reduce the cost and development time for the process \ndesign. However, due to the computational burden of the FE method there are still few \nchallenges for using the FE method as embedded optimisers for the roll process design \nproblems. This section introduces the FE method, and reviews FE applications to rolling \nproblems. \nThe aim of FE application to metal forming problems is to predict physical quantities \nsuch as stress, strain, velocity, and temperature throughout the deformed solid. This \nimplies that the physical quantities are required at infinite number of points, which \ndefines a problem with infinitely many degrees of freedom. The FE method is based on \nthe idea of discretisation where the deformation zone is divided into a finite number of \nsub-zones called elements. The elements are connected together at the corners and at \nselected points at the edges called nodes. For each element, the individual relationship \nbetween the applied nodal forces and the resulting nodal variables such as velocity and \ntemperature are calculated and the element stiffness obtained. The global stiffness \nmatrix of the whole body is then assembled by combining the elemental stiffness. A \ndetail description of the FE method is given in [4]. \nApplication of FE Method in Rolling Problems \nThe fundamentals of the rigid-viscoplastic FE method and the mathematical formulation \nare well established and given in literature ([31], [32]). Several authors ([33], [34], [35], \n[36], [37]) have applied the FE method to determine more detailed information of \nmaterial flow for shape rolling in the analysis process. In 1984, Park and Kobayashi \n[38] expanded the rigid\u2013viscoplastic FE method to three-dimensional cases. Hacquin et \nal. [39] presented a coupled model of thermo-elastoviscoplastic strip deformation and \nthermo-elastic roll deformation. The model was used to predict profile defects, strain, \nand stress maps, including residual stresses in hot and cold rolled strips. In rod rolling \n3D finite element was used to determine strain distribution for prediction of micro-\nstructural material evolution ([40], [41], [42]). Several authors ([43], [44], [45], [46], \n[47]) have used FE to determine the thickness accuracy of the strip products. These \nstudies calculated the required rolling force, torque, and power in terms of other process \nparameters such as roll speed, thickness, and temperature. Recently, Kim and Im [48] \napplied a three-dimensional FE program for analyzing shape rolling processes \nconsidering heat transfer based on rigid thermo-viscoplastic approach. round\u2013oval, \noval-oval, square\u2013oval, and square\u2013diamond passes (Figure 3) were simulated at \ndifferent friction conditions with and without temperature effects. \n \n \nFigure 3: Typical Breakdown Sequence \n \nInspite of the computational burden, FE models are becoming powerful and are \nbecoming popular for investigating technological windows of different processes in the \nsteel industry. Three-dimensional (3D) FE based codes enable the modelling of large \nplastic deformation. The FE modelling technique is reported to be more accurate and it \nprovides detailed information of plastic deformation when compared to classical rolling \ntheories. It provides an extensive description of the metal flow in the roll gap and of \nloads and motion of the whole strip and is thus widely used for simulating and analysing \nvarious metal forming processes ([49], [50], [51], [52]). The FE technique has a \nconsiderable advantage to the traditional mathematical approaches because it can \ncalculate most of the parameters characterising the process (forces, stresses, velocities, \ndisplacements, temperatures etc) in a single simulation. \nApproximation Strategies for FE Methods \nWen et al., [53] presented a simplified FE for modelling complex three-dimensional \ndeformation in section rolling. In their work, previous analysis of various passes with \nthe three-dimensional models showed CPU times between 26 and 52 hours compared to \npseudo-two-dimensional models of 2 and 3 hours. Kiuchi and Yanagimoto [54] \ndeveloped a complex element method based on the functional combination of rigid-\nplastic FE and the slab method. Kim et al. [36] further simplified the approach and \napplied the two- dimensional rigid-plastic FE method for the generalised plane strain \ncondition, and combined it with the slab method. Kim et al. [55] extended  the work by \ndeveloping a computer program called TASK  which was used by Shivpuri and Shin \n[56] to investigate RSD. In truss optimisation problems, where similar FE \ncomputational burden is also experienced, several approaches were reported to address \nthe problem. Deb and Gulati [57] in design of truss-structures, introduced the concept of \nbasic and non-basic node to emphasise creation of user-satisfactory trusses and reduce \ncomputational time. This avoided expensive FEA for unsatisfactory trusses. \nQuagliarella and Vicini [58] proposed a hierarchical approach for the fitness evaluation. \nThis involves using several solvers with different levels of accuracy, in order to use the \nmore computationally expensive models only when needed. These approaches can be \nregarded as \u201cgood house keeping measures\u201d that improves on the computational \nexpense of large FE runs; however, they fall short of alleviating the problem in the \ncontext that makes them applicable to complex real life problems. Siteo [59] developed \na Genetic Algorithm with Ancestry Record (GALGAR) within a framework of hybrid \ntechniques based on simple GA, hill-climbing and simulated annealing. The basic idea \nis to save computational FE simulation cost by storing previously processed information \nalong with the current against some pre-defined criteria. Although this approach \nintuitively suggests significant reduction of computational cost, storing previous \nsolutions could significantly disrupt the pattern formation during the search.  \nFE Method in RSD: Observations \nFE methods are capable of predicting quite accurate deformation behaviour such as roll \ncontact stresses, rolling load, and rolling torque required for RSD. However, they can be \ncomputationally expensive and the time required for a fully converged solution limits its \nwider application for optimisation problems. CPU time of 4-5 hours for 5000 \u2013 6000 \nnodes and 1000 time steps is not unusual [60]. The 3-dimensional modelling even with \nthe super computer is still time consuming and quite complex to investigate the \ninfluence of all the potential variables ([61], [62], [28]). Although the FE method \nprovides various detailed information, it can be difficult to analyse. The FE based \ndesign process often lacks structure and appears to be done sporadically. Since various \ndesign parameters are considered simultaneously, quite often practitioners seems to be \ncontent with any solution that appears feasible in light of the computational burden. In \naddition, since this approach is mainly based on QT information, it cannot address \nintegrated QT and QL search space problems [4]. \n3.1.3.Recent Mathematical Modelling Methods \nIn spite of reported model accuracy of the FE methods in metal forming problems there \nis still an increasing interest to use simplified mathematical formulae for predicting \ncomplex metal forming behaviours ([63], [64]). There are various reasons why the \nmathematical approach is still popular in the industry. It is a simplified alternative to the \ncomplex FE formulations and it requires less computational efforts. They allow \nformulation of dependencies between rolling parameters [65].  Rudkins and Evans [25] \nand Lenard et al. [28] performed off-line calculations to aid in the finishing of mill set-\nups.  In their study they use the [21] and [24] formulae to determine the likely rolling \nloads for a given reduction pattern and compared the results obtained with Finite \nElement calculations. They concluded that the FE results gives accurate prediction of \nmill loads while the Sims model [24] slightly under-predicts the values compared to that \npredicted using the [21] formula. Joun and Hwang [63] developed an approximate \nmathematical approach for predicting roll pressure and tangential stress at the roll-strip \ninterface. The authors reported that theoretical predictions agree with FE results and \nexperimental results. Although there was no optimisation study reported in the paper, \nthe authors suggested that the method could be used for optimising rolling parameters.  \nWusatowski [1] and Chitkara and Hardy [66] applied the groove rolling principle and \nproposed an empirical formula for determining spread in flat rolling. Mauk [67] adopted \na similar method and proposed an iterative approach. Hwang et al. [41] presented an \nanalytical model for predicting the mean effective strain defined as a maximum average \neffective (equivalent) plastic strain at a given pass in bar (or rod) rolling process. The \ninformation obtainable by the mathematical modelling method is limited compared to \nthe FE method since it is difficult to accommodate most of the complex factors. Like \nthe FE method, it is based on QT information only, and as a result cannot simultaneously \ndeal with integrated QT and QL search space problems. \n3.2. Approximate QL Modelling Methods \nQL information is a non-numeric method used in reasoning about the behaviour of the \nphysical environment. It is mostly used in the presence of incomplete knowledge. QL \nmodels include QL abstractions of the relations in a numerical model, the casual \ndependencies between its variables and explicit representations of the modelling \nassumptions used to describe a physical system. This section reviews QL modelling \nmethods reported in literature to deal with RSD problems. \nPataro and Helman [68] developed an approach to determine sequence of passes for the \nstrip rolling process using fuzzy logic rules. The authors suggested that the rules can be \nextracted from data obtained from theoretical model, available databases or production \ndata. Jung et al. [69] developed a fuzzy control system based on production data and \noperational knowledge. The fuzzy controller calculates the change of roll force to \nimprove the flatness of the thin strip based on the developed fuzzy rules and fuzzy \ninference. These approaches are only suitable for readily available data [70], and would \nincur significant computational cost if used for large simulations.  \nShivpuri and Kini [71] in roll pass design, generated a fuzzy model from finite element \ndata using two fuzzified design variables. In the approach adopted, design variables \nwere fuzzified and used directly as inputs in the fuzzy reasoning module. Since the \nrolling process is highly dimensional, increasing the number of design variables also \nincrease the number of rules required exponentially. This also incurs expensive \ncomputational cost since the models are generated from FE data. \n3.3. Manual Design Search Methods in RSD \nA significant part of RSD carried out in the industry is manual. This relies on adopting \nexisting solution to produce the required design where design variables are changed one \nat a time. Individual experts carried out traditional RSD by combining empirical \nknowledge developed through years of experience with rolling theory. Prior to the \n1980s, RSD had been largely based on empirical formulae. Several other authors  have \ndeveloped design rules empirically from production data ([72], [73]) and experiments \n([74], [75], [76], [77]). Based on such research work, design guidelines and the \nempirical formulations were developed to speed up the development process and to \nenable a more structured RSD approach. Although their applications have been \nrelatively successful in delivering roll design solutions, their difference in functional \ncharacters render them unsuitable for dealing with complex geometries. In RSD design \nwhere the problem involves many variables the design problem becomes too complex \ndue to curse of dimensionality. Since the human can only deal with up to 5-10 variables \nat any single time [78], the search problem reduces to costly trial and error and it \nbecomes slow and very ineffective. \nThe manual approach when used in the industry takes on various forms with respect to \nthe type of modelling approach adopted. The classical rolling theories as well as the \nrecent mathematical models when used alone are inherently trial and error search \nprocess from an initial design (single point). Each process normally requires significant \neffort and it results in long process development times and high cost of the products \n([79], [80], [81]). It is also observed that attempting to use this traditional approach may \nresult in optimising one criteria at a time [82]. Another important criterion for the RSD \nis to be able to search a large design space as quickly as possible and to deliver multiple \ngood solutions, which can be beneficial for locating a variety of good solutions. Here \nthe classical methods fail miserably. The manual RSD approach cannot produce \nmultiple good solutions due to its inherent one point solution method. In addition, since \nthis approach is mainly based on QT information it cannot simultaneously deal with QL \naspects in RSD. Although the FE method is a computational technique, a design search \nconducted using the FE method on its own is a manual process. Designers use their \nexperience to search by adopting existing design within the neighbourhood of a known \nsolution point and use FE simply to evaluate the chosen design point [18]. The \ncomputational cost of FEA and the nature of the search method inhibit elaborate \nexploration of the design space. This can result in low quality solutions as the search is \nlimited. The FE method when used alone is not suitable for generating designs at the \ninitial design stage, where a large number of alternative design solutions are required at \nlow cost and high response time. The FE model based optimisation also gets more \ncomplex and time consuming in the presence of large number of design parameters [83]. \nThis section has shown that the manual methods are single point search methods and are \nnot suitable for multiple objective problems and cannot evolve multiple good solutions. \nThe next section considers algorithmic approaches. \n3.4. Classical Algorithmic Optimisation Approaches \nClassical algorithmic optimisation approaches are alternatives to the manual methods. \nThe aim is to change values to all the design variables simultaneously to achieve a set of \nobjectives while satisfying a set of constraints. Although, it is faster and more effective \nin exploring a design space than the manual methods, this approach has received very \nlittle research interest for RSD problems. Yamada et al. [84] developed an algorithm to \noptimize load distribution using mathematical models for set-up calculation. Lapovok \nand Thompson [12] formulated a mathematical geometrical problem for tool-form \noptimisation for roll pass design. The authors used a derivative-based optimisation \nmethod to design a breakdown sequence system for rolling simple square profiles. This \napproach requires the problem to be twice differentiable and the knowledge of the \nsearch space. However, these requirements are not always satisfiable due to the \ncomplexity of the RSD problems. \n3.5. QL and QT Optimisation Strategies in Metal Forming \nSeveral integrated computational systems have been reported in literature combining \ncomputer-aided design (CAD), expert systems (ES), and the FE method in various \nconfigurations. The integrated approach can save expensive design time by re-using \nknowledge. In the 1970s integrated computer-aided systems were developed to \nincorporate mathematical design techniques and experience based intuitive skills for \nmetal forming process design. The expert system (ES) automated most of the routine \nand repetitive tasks such as die drawings and design calculations performed by \ndesigners. The benefit of the approach is that it reduced the drafting time as well as \nsome of the trial and error in the process design. Subramanian and Altan [85] integrated \na CAD and ES system and named it \u2018DIE FORGE\u2019 for die design. The designer \ninteracted with the system through QL evaluation of designs obtained from the ES. \nAlthough the system reduced repetitive tasks, it is still slow and less accurate. In an \nattempt to improve the accuracy of such systems, Akerman et al. [86] integrated FE \nmethod with a more interactive CAD system. The authors developed two computer \nprograms for modelling shape rolling for airfoil designs. The first program predicts \nlateral spread and the second program simulates rolling of simple parts. The system \nrelied on expensive trial and error FE simulations. Osakada et al. [87] later investigated \nan automatic generation of pass sequences using pattern recognition. The interactive \noperations use rules to determine the shapes and dimensions of the intermediate \nproducts. The authors experienced difficulties in expressing empirical knowledge due to \nits implicit nature and concluded that simple knowledge engineering may not be \nadequate for metal forming.  \nIn a parametric optimisation based approach, Perotti and Kapaj [88] proposed a CAD \nbased technique for automatic shape design of square passes. This technique adopts a \npoint-by-point direct search method. The search method finds parameter values of stock \nshape by iterative calculations using empirical formulae. The method is slow, requires \nmany function evaluations for convergence and tends to get stuck to sub-optimal \nsolutions [89]. Since the shape forming is a highly knowledge intensive task, Osakada et \nal. [90] extended their previous work by building expert system from FE simulations \nresults. The authors integrated expert system, FE method, and neural networks for \nknowledge acquisition. In similar approaches, several authors ([91], [92], [93], [94]) \nintegrated an expert system with a CAD software for a forming sequence. A number of \nexpert systems have also been developed to produce more efficient solutions in other \nareas, e.g. steel composition design [95]. While the expert system determined the \nfeasible pre-form sequence for the multistage forging process, the CAD provides the \ndesigner with the necessary tools to perform complete analyses for suitability. \nPredictions from the expert system are further evaluated with FE simulations. Although \nthe developed systems were more accurate, the search method was still slow due to the \nexpensive FE simulations and the inherent trial and error of QL evaluation. \nSeveral CAD commercial applications such as LINEBOW [96] and CARD [97] were \ndeveloped to help improve the design efficiency and increase productivity. These \napplications are composed of several modules of mathematical pass design models \ndesigned to reduce the repetitive task (such as calculations and drawings) performed by \nthe designers. Since the designers evaluate the overall design solution, the evaluation \nprocess of the system is still slow and unstructured due to the inherent trial and error \nnature of the designer interaction. Recent integrated strategies attempt to focus on \nautomatic generation of process design solutions. These strategies aim to provide a \nmore structured design approach free of the \u2018on-line\u2019 designer\u2019s QL evaluation. Im and \nKim [98] developed a knowledge based expert system (KBES) using object oriented \nprogramming (OOP) for the design of roll pass, profile sequence and shape rolling of \nround and square bars. The authors built KBES using empirical design rules adopted \nfrom basic design theory and practice. Farrugia and Jennings [18] developed the current \nstate of the art integrated KBES\/CAD system. The authors combined KBES, CAD, and \nFE analysis for automatic generation of roll design solutions. The KBES records, \nmaintains, and automates designs, the CAD generates drawings and the interface \nsoftware and the FE simulator provide a broad range of advanced analysis capabilities. \nAlthough the system can deal with a broad range of problems, the search for good \nsolutions is still based on a point-by-point method. This can present difficulties for \nproblems with large number of variables and evaluation can be time consuming since \nthe solution is analysed by the FE solver. It was also argued that KBES is not suitable \nfor RSD design optimisation because an infinite number of rules are required [13]. \nThis section has shown that there are attempts to combine QT and QL information in \nmetal forming process design problem. These approaches offer interesting combination \nof knowledge based systems, CAD, and FE analysis. The KBES approach is capable of \nproducing simulation results quickly and are suitable for metal forming applications \nwhere the knowledge is well known. The CAD\/KBS reduces repetitive detailing work \nperformed by the designers and saves valuable design time that can used to generate \nmore creative design output. It can also incorporate the QL information from the \nengineers to guide the search for good realistic solutions.   \nQT and QL of Integrated Strategies in Metal Forming: Observations \nThe following issues pose several difficulties for the hybrid approaches mentioned \nabove: \n\u2022 Development of KBES is a complex task because the metal forming knowledge is \noften ill-structured, implicit, difficult to systematise and involves a large number of \nrules ([90], [99]). \n\u2022 The KBES are not suitable in areas where the knowledge is not well known for \nexample in hot strip rolling areas such as roll damage, roll wear and sheet shape \nprofile [100]. \n\u2022 The approach is not capable of dealing with multi-objective optimisation problems \nand is not suitable for simultaneously dealing with integrated QT and QL search \nspace problems. The search method produces single point solutions, which can be \nslow and tedious due to its inherent trial and error approach. \n\u2022 These methods do not conduct an algorithmic search and as a result often offer \nsatisfying solutions and not the optimal. \n3.6. Multi-Pass RSD Optimisation Approaches \nThe multi-pass RSD problem is synonymous to the sequential process optimisation \nproblem outlined in section 2. The multi-pass problem aims to provide optimal design \nsolutions for individual passes of the rolling process including both design information \nsuch as the geometrical size of a roll and the operating conditions for the mills [1]. This \naims to achieve the desired product quality without violating the operating constraints \nof the overall process. Approaches for addressing this problem includes the FE method, \nbackward tracing [49], forward tracing [101], and a derivative based approach ([102], \n[103]). \nDespite the high computational expense, the FE method is still very widely used for \nsolving metal forming multi-pass optimisation problems ([33], [34], [35], [36]). There \nare various FE based approaches reported in the literature for dealing with process \noptimisation for metal forming. Two of such approaches are backward tracing and the \nderivative based approach. The backward tracing starts with the final phase of the \ndeformation stage and traces the loading path (deformation process in non-steady \nforming) backward to predict optimal pre-form design associated with the finished part. \nPark et al. [49] and Kobayashi [104] applied a backward tracing technique to design a \npre-form in a shell housing. The thermo-viscoplastic deformation was modelled as a \nboundary value problem after the FE discretisation and the solution satisfies the system \nof non-linear coupled algebraic equations. The backward tracing technique has also \nbeen applied to plane-strain rolling problems  [105] and disk forging where a uniformly \ndeformed disk is sought under the influence of friction at the interface of the die and \nwork-piece [106]. Although, the technique has been shown to discover the desired final \nshape in various forming problems, the backward tracing technique, when used alone, \ncannot uniquely determine the optimal solutions due to the presence of diverse and \nmultiple loading solution paths [107]. The back tracing technique tends to be more \nefficient when the loading path is known,  however this can lead to difficulties in real \nworld problems where the search space is complex and unknown especially when \nmultiple diverse loading paths are present. \nSeveral authors have used the derivative based approach to solve multi-pass \noptimisation problems. For the derivative approach, the optimal process design problem \nis initially formulated mathematically based on a penalty rigid-viscoplastic FE method. \nThe solution approach obtains derivatives of the design objective and design constraints \nwith respect to the design variables. Current design variables for a given design iteration \nin the process optimisation are then evaluated using the values of the derivatives \nobtained. Joun and Hwang [102], [103] developed a FE based process optimisation \ntechnique and applied it to a die profile design extrusion problem. A non-linear iterative \noptimisation algorithm was adopted to minimise the forming energy. In the proposed \nalgorithm, the authors  integrated design sensitivity analysis with finite element analysis \nfor the deformation analysis. The authors extended the work for pass schedule optimal \ndesign in multi-pass extrusion and drawing process [108]. Barinarayanan and Zabaras \n[109] and Forment and Chenot [110], [111] applied the method for optimisation of die \nand preform shapes in non-steady state forming.   In their study, the initial shape of the \npart as well as the shape of the preform tool was optimised for a two-step forging \noperation where the shape of the second operation is known. Shapes were described \nusing spline functions and optimal parameter values of the splines were searched in \norder to produce a part with a prescribed geometric accuracy, optimal metallurgical \nproperties and minimal production cost at the end of the forging sequence. The work \nwas later extended to solve non-isothermal, non steady forming problem [112]. \nShin et al. [37] conducted a simulation study on I-section beam with four passes. The \nauthors carried out a simplified three-dimensional FE method and a physical experiment \nwith plasticine. Since the technique is inherently a trial and error approach, the \ndevelopment of analysis tool for RSD permitting prediction of the effect of process \nvariables with speed, economy and a level of parameter control can not be attained by \nconventional experiments [14]. \nProcess sequence design for new materials and complex geometries is not easy to carry \nout due to the complexity of the process [98]. There are major difficulties involved with \nsystematic process design through the analytical approach due to the non-deterministic \nnature of the process. For multi-pass designs it is not economically trivial to determine \nthe optimum process sequence without making any deviations from these various paths. \nMulti-pass RSD Optimisation Approaches: Observations   \nFollowing observations can be made from the study above: \n \n\u2022 The tracing techniques require knowledge of the search space to perform efficiently, \nhowever this is not always possible since search space can be very complex and \nunknown. \n\u2022 These techniques are derivative based and require an initial guess, which can \ninfluence the search. This derivative based approach also tends to get stuck in sub-\noptimal solutions and an algorithm that is efficient in solving one optimisation \nproblem may not be efficient in solving a different optimisation problem [113]. \n\u2022 The techniques cannot also identify multiple optimal solutions in a single run for the \nmulti-objective multi-pass rolling problem. The techniques do not also consider the \nrelationship between passes. \n3.7. Soft Computing Techniques in Metal Forming  \nSoft computing (SC) is a collection of methodologies including, as its main \nconstituents, Evolutionary Computation (EC), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Neuro-computing \n(NC), and probabilistic computing (PC) [114]. SC aims to exploit tolerance for \nimprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low cost \nsolutions. It differs from conventional techniques in that, it incorporates human \nknowledge into the solution methodology. This offers the opportunity to deal with \nambiguity and uncertainty in real world problem and can result in more realistic \nsolutions. The application of intelligent SC techniques is increasing with successful \napplications in many areas including but not limited to: engineering design \noptimisation, manufacturing system, process control, medical diagnosis, simulation and \ncommunication systems [115]. Some of the principal combinations of SC components \nare: fuzzy logic + genetic algorithm, neural network + genetic algorithm, neural \nnetwork + chaos theory, neuro computing + fuzzy logic, fuzzy logic + probabilistic \nreasoning etc [115]. This paper focuses on the combination of fuzzy Logic (FL) + \ngenetic algorithm as a SC technology for the RSD problem. \nAlthough SC techniques are emerging as an alternative for solving real world \nengineering problems [114], however, its application to metal forming design is still not \ncommon [116]. Oduguwa et al. [117], [118] presented survey of EC techniques to metal \nforming. There are two main research trends emerging in literature on the application of \nSC techniques for metal forming problems. The first aims to automate the search using \nEC based techniques by adopting a process model, and the second attempts to deal with \nthe complexity of the metal forming domain problem using fuzzy based modelling \nmethodology. The overall aim of these two broad approaches is to develop low-cost \ncomputational techniques to guide an algorithmic search for good solutions in real-\nworld process optimisation problems. Most of the applications reported in literature use \nthe FE solver as embedded design evaluation tool for the RSD. \nRoy et al. [119] implemented an adaptive Micro Genetic Algorithm for shape \noptimisation of process variables in multi-pass wire drawing processes. A modular \nbased FE package was used to evaluate the objective functions. In a similar approach, \nHwang and Chung [120] proposed a modified micro genetic algorithm for the \noptimisation of design variables for die shape in extrusion. The authors reported that \nconvergence was fast for the first 200 iterations and was slow afterwards. In a recent \napplication of the approach for process optimisation in forging [107] the authors \nreported that for 1000 FE simulations the search required 200 hours for the \nconvergence. \nIn an attempt to deal with such large computational cost, several authors have adopted \nneural network based methods to develop process models for fast and inexpensive \npredictions. Myllykoski et al. [70] developed process models for optimisation of rolling \nprocesses. Nolle et al. [121] proposed an approach using neural network and GA for the \noptimisation of roll profiles in strip rolling. Such hybrid approaches require a large \nnumber of sample data to develop the neural network model. The approach is not \nsuitable for RSD where the large amount of data required to build the model can be \nexpensive to obtain or are not readily available. \nSeveral authors are now adopting fuzzy logic in RSD for modelling QL information. \n[68] developed an approach to determine sequence of passes for the strip rolling process \nusing fuzzy logic rules. The authors developed fuzzy logic rules from production data. \nThis proposed method, although suitable for generating fuzzy based models with real \nprocessing conditions, is not capable of identifying optimal sequences as it has no \noptimisation capability. Jung and Im [122] developed a fuzzy algorithm to calculate the \nroll speed variations in order to improve the thickness uniformity of hot-rolled strips \nconsidering the complex relationships of process parameters such as roll speed, \nreduction ratio, strip entry thickness, front and back strip tensions and the deformation \nof the machinery in the mill system. This work is an interesting example of using SC \ntechniques to deal with complex behaviour, especially if no mathematical model exists \nto express such behaviour. Since the proposed approach lacks optimisation capability, it \nis also not capable of identifying optimal roll speed variations. \nShivpuri and Kini [71] developed an optimisation technique using an hybrid of \nempirical knowledge, FE simulations and fuzzy analysis to improve product quality of \nRSD. In their approach, simulation points based on experimental design were selected \nin the neighbourhood of the optimal design region and the optimal solution is then \nidentified from the resulting fuzzy based evaluations. Although this approach offers a \nsemi-automatic method of generating optimal solutions, it has the following drawbacks. \nIn general, the exploratory potential of the hybrid approach is weak due to the absence \nof an algorithmic search technique. The experimental design used for selecting \nsimulation points is a random sampling plan, and may miss the optimal design points. \nRecently, Oduguwa and Roy [123] presented an integrated design optimisation \napproach for QT and QL search space and applied it to the RSD. The proposed solution \napproach is based on design of experiment methods and fuzzy logic principles for \nbuilding the required QL models, and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation \ntechnique for solving the design problem. The proposed technique was applied to a two \nobjectives rod rolling problem ([124], [125]) and 4 stage multi-pass RSD problem [4]. \nThe authors demonstrated that promising results can be obtained from the proposed \napproach for dealing with RSD taking into account the related QL evaluation of the \ndesign problem. \nSoft Computing Techniques in Metal Forming: Observations \n\u2022 Soft Computing techniques can help in addressing a number of limitations of \nclassical approaches, but still have some limitations: \n\u2022 EC based techniques using the FE solver as embedded design evaluation tool incurs \nsevere computational cost. This problem intensifies since EC techniques require to \nevaluate large number of solutions before convergence. This inhibits the use of the \nEC based optimisation approach to wider range of metal forming problems. \n\u2022 Fuzzy Logic based design evaluation tools need to model a smaller set of critical \nprocess parameters, otherwise the number of rules required for the system can \nincrease exponentially with the increase in the number of parameters. \n \n4. CHALLENGES: IN PRACTICE AND IN RESEARCH  \nThe RSD plays a significant part in delivering timely optimal products to the markets. \nThis paper presents a critical analysis of the RSD optimisation approaches. The review \nexplored how the reported techniques search for good RSD solutions in terms of \nefficiency and cost of the search approaches. The review also considered the capability \nof handling multi-objective optimisation problems and integrated QL and QT search \nspaces. This section now explores the challenges poised by RSD as an optimisation \nproblem and discusses how the reviewed approaches influence new product \ndevelopment in the steel industry. This discussion section concludes with an outline of \ninteresting research areas identified as a result of this study.  \n4.1. Challenges posed by Optimisation of RSD \nThere are several challenges posed by optimisation search procedures for RSD \nproblems. These challenges often inhibit the wider application of these procedures for \nrolling system design. This section identifies the challenges from both an industrial \napplication viewpoint and an algorithmic perspective. \n4.1.1.Challenges of Algorithm based Optimisation in Industry  \nIn spite of the potential benefits achievable from using algorithm based optimisation \napproaches for generating high quality design solutions, it is very surprising that the \napplication of such approaches is still not grasping the headlines for industrial \napplications. This section presents industrial perspective based on the authors\u2019 \nobservations from a survey conducted in steel industry on the modelling and design \nactivities [4]. These observations have been obtained through a cross-disciplinary data \ncollection approach adopted in this study. This has enriched the knowledge used for \ngenerating the observations outlined below.  \n\u2022 Designers lack a full working knowledge of algorithmic optimisation approaches. \nThey often perceive it as a highly theoretical approach, which bears little or no \nrelevance to the day-to-day design activity. This issue is reflected by the comment \nmade by a roll designer during a semi-structured interview including the author, a \nroll modeller, and the roll designer. These engineers were asked about their \nviewpoint regarding the potential benefits that optimisation approach could add to \nroll design. One of the engineers commented that \u201coptimisation is a different kind of \nlogic which is only good for academics\u2019 purposes but not suitable for roll design \nproblems.\u201d     \n\u2022 Formulating the optimisation problem is difficult for the average engineer who is \nnot familiar with the optimisation techniques. The features of the optimisation \nproblems (multiple objectives, constraints etc) and the availability of countless \nnumber of possible classical optimisation algorithms contribute to this difficulty. \nSelecting suitable objectives and formulating the constraints to reflect the real \nscenario is non-trivial. Classical optimisation algorithms tend to require prior \nknowledge of the search space and this is not always possible for real life problems \ndue to its inherent complexities.      \n\u2022 There is a cultural misconception inherent in most engineers regarding the role of \noptimisation in product and process design. It is commonly perceived that since \noptimisation can automatically generate design solutions, the approach can \neventually replace their jobs. This fear of losing their jobs places severe restrictions \nin the buy-in required from these user groups. This point was reflected in an \nengineer\u2019s comment during an informal interviewing session \u201cI would rather not use \nthis technique, because you know where this is going, I am going to lose my job\u201d. \nAlso when asked about sharing the optimisation knowledge with other areas of the \nbusiness, the engineer commented \u201cwe would rather keep the optimisation \nknowledge within the department as this ensures people always come to us when \nthey have problems\u201d  \n4.1.2.Challenges posed by RSD on Optimisation Algorithms \nThis section identifies some challenges of RSD optimisation poses on the optimisation \nalgorithms. \n\u2022 The features of the real-life process optimisation problem, such as the presence of \nmultiple objectives, constraints, interaction among decision variables, QT and QL \nnature of the information and sequential nature of the design problem create \nchallenges for optimisation algorithms that are currently available for the industry. \nThis discourages the industry to adopt these algorithms.  \n\u2022 A process model that explains the behaviour of the design problem is a pre-requisite \nof any optimisation problem. It is needed by the optimisation algorithm to evaluate \nthe goodness of the solution. High computational expense (for example FEA) \ninhibits its application, in addition poor quality models result in engineers having \nlittle faith in them. This also makes them sceptical about the results obtained from \nthe optimisation algorithms. Therefore, developing RSD process models of \nreasonable computational cost and acceptable quality is an important but quiet \ndifficult task. This point was well captured by a rolling engineer in a discrete event \nsimulation workshop. When asked why optimisation is not part of the design \nactivity for rolling system design, the engineer replied \u201cwhat is there to optimise?\u201d, \nimplying process models are not available due to the complexity involved in \nbuilding them.   \n\u2022 Realistic process models infer models not only based on QT formulations but also \nmodels based on perception based reasoning (QL) of the engineers [126]. This shifts \nthe complexity of the search space to a new paradigm and an optimisation algorithm \nneeds to be developed to deal with such complex models.  \n\u2022 An important consideration for obtaining a realistic solution is to ensure the solution \nstrategy closely mimics the nature of the problem. This can ensure that the search \npreserves the structure of the problem and provides results that can be traced back to \nits solution mechanism. This also provides more transparency for the engineers \nsince they are able to understand the steps taken to arrive at the result. Developing \nan algorithm with such features can increase the complexity of the algorithm and \ncompromise its performance.  \n4.2. Evaluation of RSD Optimisation Approaches for New Product Development \nThis section presents an evaluation of the RSD techniques reviewed in the previous \nsections in terms of their suitability for various stages of the new product development \n(NPD) process. This was considered necessary in order to explore the relationship \nbetween the techniques and the different stages of the development process. This can be \nuseful in identifying the most suitable technique for a given stage of the product \ndevelopment process. \n \nFigure 4: Optimisation approaches and NPD \nThe review in the previous sections shows that the incremental development of \napproaches since 1950 has addressed various aspects of the search problem with varying \nsuccesses. Figure 4 shows a summary of the reviewed approaches and subjective ratings \nin terms of robustness and exploratory potential for a given technique with respect to \nthe NPD process. A typical product development process consists of the following \nstages: feasibility studies - concept design - design development and detail design [4]. \nFor such paradigm, the level of design exploration required at each stage of the process \nincreases from right to left, likewise the level of detail and accuracy required increases \nfrom left to right. For example, at the feasibility stage, a significant amount of \nexploration with relatively small accuracy is required to identify any solution \nalternatives. While for the detail design stage, very little exploration is required since \nthe design is already chosen. Here, the emphasis is on high accuracy and detail to ensure \nthe required objective is specified. \n \nTable 1: Technical Capabilities of the RSD optimisation approaches \nCurrent \nApproache\ns \nMulti-\nobjective \nQT and QL QT QL\nExploratory \nPotential \nManual 8 8 9 8 * \nRolling \nTheories \n8 8 9 8 * \nFE 8 8 9 8 * \nKBS\/ES 8 9 9 9 * \nClassical \nOptimisatio\nn \n8 8 9 8 *** \nSC 9 8 9 9 **** \n \nTable 1 shows the technical capabilities of the optimisation approaches in terms of \nmulti-objective optimisation problems, QT and QL, QT, QL and exploratory potential. \nThe exploratory potential signifies the capability to search a design space with \nreasonable effort. The rating given here is subjective from the authors\u2019 viewpoint and is \nmeant to illustrate the relative strength of exploration for the approaches surveyed. \nApproaches with one star \u201c*\u201d confirms that they are based on manual search. It is clear \nfrom this evaluation that SC techniques have the highest exploratory potential and it is \ncapable of handling multi-objective problems. However, most of the reported \napproaches are computationally expensive as shown by the location of item 7 in Figure \n4.  It is also observed that most of the FE based approaches (4, 5, 6, and 7) shown in \nFigure 4 are ranked with high quality. FE based approaches are computationally \nexpensive but can produce good quality results. The figure also shows the need to \ndevelop suitable approaches for the feasibility stage of the RSD. The following sections \noutline future research directions to deal with these challenges.  \n4.3. Future Research Directions \nFuture research directions can be summarised as follows: \n \n\u2022 Approximate strategies for QT multi-objective optimisation problems: \nOptimisation approaches that require a smaller population for convergence whilst \nminimising the error between the simulation and the approximate models should be \nfurther investigated. Emerging EC based sampling techniques such Kriging, MARS \ncan be explored. \n\u2022 Integrated QT and QL information: Studies are required to develop optimisation \nalgorithms that can deal with various combinations of QT and QL information, such \nas complementary and non-cooperative forms, in a single framework. Scalability of \nintegrated QT and QL design optimisation strategies to higher dimensional problems \nis an important success criterion for wider applications. This is influenced by the \nfeature of the problem (large number of parameters) and the nature of the resulting \nsearch space (discontinuous).  \n\u2022 Techniques are required for representing the native parameter space of the QL \ninformation within the optimisation framework. This could provide capabilities for \ntuning the correlation between the granularities of the QL models with the \nmeasurement scale of the QT models. Search algorithms that consider such features \nof the problem should give better performance.    \n\u2022 Within the multi-pass optimisation contribution from the several stages may even \nout fluctuation caused by many of the underlying factors influencing the search \ndirections, this may not always be the case and could result in deceptions in the \nsearch problem. Further study could consider investigating the behaviour between \ndifferent rolling stages during the evolutionary search. Such information could be \nvaluable in understanding the convergence behaviour of the search space, which \ncould result in improved algorithms.   \n\u2022 An inherent feature of the process optimisation problem is the hierarchical nature. \nThere is a need to develop a hierarchical optimisation approaches that can recognise \ndifferences at the subsystem level (each mill stand) but performs a system level \noptimisation (e.g. for the rolling operation as a whole).   \n \n5. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe key conclusions from the review can be summarised as follows: \n\u2022 Classical rolling theories have limited success in delivering roll design solutions. \nTheir limitations can influence optimal RSD in terms of the quality of solutions, and \npoor response to a broad range of problems.  \n\u2022 The FE method provides a variety of detailed and high quality information, however \nthe FE based design process often lacks structure and appears to be done \nsporadically. It is computationally expensive and often tends to inhibit its \napplication to a broader range of RSD problems. \n\u2022 When generating a fuzzy model from FE data, increasing the number of design \nvariables used in developing the fuzzy model also increases the number of rules \nexponentially. This incurs expensive computational cost. Very little research has \nbeen reported to deal with the QT and QL RSD problems. Most of the soft computing \nbased efforts in RSD either focus on evolutionary computing or fuzzy logic based \ntechniques. \n\u2022 There has been little focus in developing optimisation approaches with high \nexploratory potential that generate a large number of alternative optimal RSD \nsolutions or have the capability to deliver the required quality of solutions for the \nconcept and feasibility design stage of the new product development. \nThis paper has presented a comprehensive review of approaches for rolling system \ndesign optimisation and discussed their advantages and disadvantages. The review has \ncritically analysed how each approach contributes to developing timely low cost optimal \nsolutions and how they influence new product development strategies for the steel \nindustry. The challenges posed by the RSD problem and the future research directions \nare also identified. \n   \n6.
