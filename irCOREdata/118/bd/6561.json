J. H. Fowler1\nBT Adastral Park, email: chris.fowler@bt.com\nIntroduction\nBT has had, and will continue to have, a long and fruitful partnership with all the education\nsectors in the UK. This includes supporting schools (e.g., the LINK scheme), the higher\neducation (HE) sector (e.g., the University Development Awards) and more recently the further\neducation (FE) sector also through an award scheme. These initiatives form part of BT's\ncommunity programme. It was not until 1994 that BT considered entering the education and\ntraining market on a commercial footing. At about that time, the Education and Training\nResearch Programme began at what was then BT Laboratories, now BT Adastral Park.\nThis special issue describes some of the work carried out as part of this programme, either\ndirectly or through close links with academic partners. The papers focus on our work in HE and\nFE. However, one paper (Bowskill and Dyer) refers to technology use in schools. The\ntechnology used and the lessons learnt from this work are transferable to other sectors. The\nselected papers deal with the following issues:\n\u2022 learning theories (Fowler and Mayes) and their implications (Dineen, Mayes and Lee);\n\u2022 the construction of a Generic Learning Platform (Gardner and Ward);\n\u2022 management of change issues (Squires);\n\u2022 demonstrations of the next generation of educational and training services (Bowskill and\nDyer, and Squires).\nWe also support innovative work through our BT short-term research fellows. The paper by\nSquires illustrates such work.\nLearning theories and their implications\nBT Adastral Park has many talented technologists and our universities have some first-class\nlecturers. However, there is a reality gap between the understanding of the pedagogy and the\nrealization of appropriate learning technologies. We argue that you cannot have 'pedagogy\n2\nAlt-) Volume 7 Number 3\nwithout technology' nor 'technology without pedagogy'. It was our attempt to bridge the gap\nbetween theory and design that drove the work into formulating a learning framework. Mayes\n(1995) started the processes through developing a three-stage model of learning. The model was\nsoon refined on the basis of experience (Fowler and Mayes, 1997) but we still felt it was lacking\nin the areas of explaining motivation, adequately reflecting the social nature of learning, and\nrecognizing the interplay between pedagogical and organizational design. It was these issues\nand others that Fowler and Mayes address in this issue through their concept of 'learning\nrelationships'. Although this is essentially a theoretical paper, it is one that is grounded in\ndesign and practice issues. The approach offered focuses on reality, and we hope will inform\nboth instructional and learning system design in the future.\nOne of the implications arising from the work of Fowler and Mayes is the need to rethink our\nconcept of courseware in the digital world (Mayes and Fowler, 1999). Another is the\nrecognition, or perhaps rediscovery, of the importance of dialogue in learning, and the reuse of\ndialogue for the vicarious learner (Mayes et al., this edition). The vicarious learning or 'learning\nby lurking' once frowned upon in our tutorials may now have a legitimate place in the range of\navailable learning styles or strategies.\nGeneric learning platforms (GLP)\nAn important observation arising particularly from the work with schools was the ability of the\nchildren to learn quickly to use a full range of software. We did not develop special software,\neven for the youngest children with whom we worked (nine years old). They were exposed to\nand successfully used proprietary software (e.g., MS Office; Adobe Photoshop). This led us to\nthink that at least between the ages of nine and ninety learning was a universal process, and\nbuilding sector-specific solutions made little educational or commercial sense. From this the\nnotion of the Generic Learning Platform (GLP) was born. The GLP described in the paper was\nheavily influenced by Mayes' framework. In particular the use of the 'Meeting Place' was in\ndirect response to providing a rich area for dialogue to take place and be captured for reuse.\nOf course, we recognized that the basic components were universal but each instantiation would\nneed to be configured to suit the particular needs of a sector (i.e. schools, FE, and HE). Indeed\nthe GLP is an essential concept for realizing the notion of life-long learning. Commercially the\nGLP made sound business sense because of its ability to reuse the same basic components\nacross a range of markets. Gardner and Ward's paper describes the GLP and our attempts to test\nit across the education market sectors.\nManagement of change issues\nIt soon became apparent from our research that many of our concerns were less to do with the\ntechnology and more to do with the people. Winning the hearts and minds of teachers will be\nthe key to any successful changes. These management of change issues were emphasized in our\nwork with colleges. For example, in the Merlin and Northern Colleges Network trials\n(described by Gardner and Ward) the teachers suffered from a 'competence gap'. These were\nexperienced teachers but they had difficulties making the transition from using traditional\ncourseware to material based on digital technology. The temptation always was to digitize\nexisting materials, and it was only when interactive designers joined the trials teams that they\nrecognized the full power of digitized courseware.\nIn this context Squires attempts to offer a solution for the new teachers in these new and often\nvirtual learning environments. In particular, Squires addresses the issue of the virtual teacher -\n3\nEditorial\none no longer fixed in time or place. What are the needs of such teachers? A key concept for\nSquires is teachers maintaining 'presence', not in a physical sense, but in terms of their\nprofessional, commercial and managerial selves. Understanding the problem is not sufficient\nand Squires takes the issue further by offering a range of design solutions that could meet the\nneeds of a 'peripatetic electronic teacher' (PET) in a future HE scenario.\nThe next generation of educational technologies\nThe education and training programme needs to feed into the commercial arms of BT. We see\nourselves as providing new ideas and concepts to our marketing people, service definitions to\nour product managers, and new tools and technologies for our developers. To help position our\nwork we describe our research outputs as belonging to different generations. First-generation\nproducts and services are already out there in the market-place. As a research team we restrict\nourselves to providing consultancy and evaluation of the use of the first-generation services.\nSecond generation refers to the innovative use of existing or very soon-to-be technologies. Our\nschool work is a good example of this. The Internet and ISDN had arrived but how teachers\ncould use these technologies to rethink teaching and learning is still not well understood.\nBy contrast third-generation work is more at the cutting edge, often exploring the use of new\ntechnologies or extensive bandwidth provision. When new technologies become more available\nwe need to be ready to understand how to exploit them. Unfortunately, the term generation,\nalthough useful initially, can become more difficult when used across sectors. For example, the\ntechnology described by Bowskill and Dyer is undoubtedly third generation with respect to the\nschool sector, but only second generation for many corporates and some universities. The GLP\ndescribed by Gardner and Ward is definitely considered as a second-generation product in all\nsectors, as the technology is not prohibitively expensive and it involves innovative practice on\nthe part of the users.\nThe future of BT's education and training research programme\nWhere is the programme going in the future? In a commercial environment, funding is on a\nyearly basis and can stop as easily as it starts! However, our current plans are to use Mayes's\nframework to design from scratch an Advanced Learning Environment. We are also interested\nin considering some of the 'implications' of work by Mayes et al. by further investigating\nlearning relationships, social semiotics with particular emphasis on the cognitive implications\nof the new media, and the role of 'engagement' in learning. And on the practical side, we are\ninterested in building analytical tools that can help us define services based on the learning\nrelationship approach, and to explore the use of component architecture in association with\nmeta data concepts in the design of virtual universities.\nWe have in our possession some very powerful educational tools. The question is: are they to\nremain on the shelf labelled as another set of educational technology tools that failed to live up\nto its promise or are we to grasp the nettle and truly re-engineer the way we teach and learn? We\nhope these papers make a small but significant contribution to answering this question.\nNote\n1\n Chris Fowler is the Manager of the BT's Education and Training Research Programme.
