The idea of self-\nregulating markets appeared in a very blatant way not to be such a good one, \nand concerted actions by states and national banks were essential in avoiding \na financial meltdown with global consequences. It was clear for all to see that \nthe self-correcting powers attributed to the market by neoliberal ideology \nfailed massively. Confident claims by US Federal Reserve president Bernanke \n(2004) of permanent stable growth and the \u2018Great Moderation\u2019 sounded \nsuddenly very hollow and complicit. As Manne (2010: 29) succinctly puts it: \n \nAt the moment of truth, the idea central to the neo-liberal faith \u2013 the \nsuperiority of the invisible hand of the market to the economic intervention of \ngovernment \u2013 was understood by virtually by everyone who mattered to be a \nmyth. \n \nIt could very well be that a paradigm shift is afoot in the long run, as Manne \nsuggests, but three years onwards neoliberalism proves to be more resilient \nthan initially thought and hoped for by many.  \n \nCritical theory has always articulated neo-liberalism as an ideology which has \nover the last decades managed to establish itself as the new unquestionable \nmeta-narrative. Peters (2001, 119) asserts in this regard that \u2018[n]eoliberals \nhave harnessed a project of postmodernity as the master narrative to \nlegitimate an extreme form of economic rationalism\u2019.  \n \nThis was in many ways further consolidated by third way politics, theorized by \nGiddens (1994), but put into political practice by Clinton, Blair, and many \nother social democrats across Europe and beyond. They all claimed to \nnegotiate a position in-between socialism and neo-liberalism \u2013 \u2018beyond \nideology\u2019, but ended-up legitimating and deepening many of the values and \ndiscursive logics of neo-liberalism while denouncing collective socialist core-\nvalues and legacies. Hall\u2019s (2003, 22) account of New Labour in the UK, \nechoed by Mouffe (2005, 60) and \u017di\u017eek (2008, 189), is useful in this regard: \n \nIt delivers what Philip Bobbit calls 'the market state', or, more simply, a 'social \ndemocratic variant of neo-liberalism' (in exactly the same way that \nThatcherism delivered a 'neo-liberal variant' of classic Conservatism). \n \nThe great irony of the recent three years is that saving our societies from the \ndisastrous effects of neo-liberal deregulation might lead to another crucial \npart of the neo-liberal agenda becoming a distinct reality; namely a drastic \nshrinkage of the social safety nets provided by states and an even greater \ninvolvement of the private sector through the outsourcing of \u2018public\u2019 services, \nmanifested by a shrinkage of rights and, consequently, higher costs for \ncitizens. \n \nAs a result of the enormous resources poured into the financial system by \nstates and the ensuing economic crisis in some of the leading world \neconomies, many states are now pushed to sanitize their public finances by \ndrastically cutting their budgets, which inevitably has serious implications for \nthe extent and nature of their welfare and education provisions. Through \nsaving the capitalist structures and financial architecture we risk ending up \nwith a truly minimal and thus neo-liberal state (Harvey, 2005). \n \nThe question central in this special issue is related to this broader debate \noutlined above and asks what the consequences are of calls for more \nregulation of the financial sector and the increased role and responsibility of \nthe state in the banking system for the position of the state and regulation in \nother sectors, specifically, in media and communication. In this regard a \nmixed picture emerges, but at the same time the different contributions \nconfirm the analysis above, namely, that neo-liberalism \u2013 understood as \npromoting deregulation, a withdrawal of the state and advocating the primacy \nof the market \u2013 is still very much alive and by no means weakened by the \nevents of the last three years. It is in other words too early to herald the \nbeginning of a post-liberal order.  \n \nMarco Briziarelli examines what arguably is a worst-case scenario for \nneoliberal media, the near-total monopolization of a national media system in \nthe hands of one powerful figure. Silvio Berlusconi has a stranglehold on the \ntelevision system of Italy through his ownership of the media conglomerate \nMediaset and through his influence over the board of directors of RAI, the \nItalian public broadcasting system. Through his influence over the making of \nmedia policy, and the flouting of it when it suits him, Berlusconi embodies the \nlogical extremes that fulfill the worst possible fears from neoliberal media: the \nnear-absolute concentration of national media power and near-total disregard \nfor any semblance of democratic governance of the media. \n \nRobin Mansell's contribution focuses on the prevalence of the discourse of \nindividualism in neo-liberal argument. In an Internet age, the discourse of \nconsumer empowerment justifies deregulation and marketization, resulting in \nthe continued favoring of the interests of large corporations and some \n(Western) states, to the detriment of citizens' interests, public goods and \npublic services. These imbalances are exposed through a discussion of the \noligopolistic nature of media and communication industries, changes in \nregulatory frameworks in relation to spectrum allocation and attempts to \nquantify  'public value' in the context of public service broadcasting. Mansell \ndoes see little evidence of the passing of neoliberalism. \n \nIn an essay that effectively bridges the preoccupations of political economy \nand cultural studies, Haiqing Yu explores the content, audience reception, \nneoliberal values embedded in a popular 33-episode Chinese television drama \ncalled Dwelling Narrowness. In the series, the lives of characters are \ncircumscribed by economic hardship and a limited social safety net within a \ncontext of rapid urbanization. As a growing number of scholars indicate, \nalthough neoliberalism has its own peculiar inflections within the Chinese \nnational context, it is an ideology and set of political and economic practices \nthat are alive and well in China. Yu refers to neoliberalism as \u201ca type of \neconomic policy, a cultural structure, a set of particular attitudes toward \nindividual responsibility, entrepreneurship and self-improvement.\u201d Her \naccount of Dwelling Narrowness illustrates in microcosm the malaise of class \npolitics and struggle in neoliberal China. \n \nThe piece by Bart Cammaerts examines rejections of the commodity exchange \nand property regimes in a digital context through disruptive sharing practices. \nThis also brings to the fore older cultural exchange models based on gift-\neconomies. Through an analysis of the sharing of code, digital content and \n(wifi-)access, Cammaerts shows that altruism is often not the main impetus of \nthese types of immaterial sharing. Furthermore, market actors and states \ncontinuously develop strategies to co-opt, neutralize or repress such \ndisruptive sharing practices and re-instate market principles. This is obvious \namongst others through the massive involvement of part of the corporate \nsector and many public administrations in the Free and Open Source \nMovement, by the attempts to coerce the sharers of digital content back into \nthe commodity exchange model and the appropriation of rural community \nwifi by companies. \n \nIn the article by Natalie Fenton, the consequences of a neoliberal agenda for \nthe provision of news and information are assessed on the basis of a four-year \nprogram of research into new media and news. Fenton documents how news \nmedia and journalists are experiencing difficulties in coping with a context of \nubiquitous 24\/7 news brought to consumers through an ever increasing \nnumber of platforms, channels and formats. Her conclusions are dim. The \nmarket model on which commercial news media operate is not producing \nvaried, pluralistic, critical and quality news, essential for democracy. Fenton \nargues that the increased homogenization and trivialization of content, the \nconcentration in cross-ownership, combined with pressures on networked \njournalists to be multifaceted and -functional, has in effect led to market \nfailure from a democratic perspective, which requires creative public \nresponses. \n \nThe role of public\/organic intellectuals in all this cannot be underestimated. \nHowever, as Gramsci (1971: 10) points out, this role cannot be limited to \neloquence. Intellectuals should go beyond the pessimism of the intellect and \nact \u2018as constructor and organiser, \"permanent persuader,\" and not just a \nsimple orator\u2019. Permeating all contributions in this special issue is a desire \nand need to creatively imagine and advocate for another world in which \nmarket interests and capitalistic relations do not dominate all walks of life.  \n \nI think they [neoliberals] are going to find a solution for the capitalist class and \nif the rest of us get screwed, too bad. The only thing they would care about is if \nwe rose up in revolt. And until we rise up in revolt they are going to redesign \nthe system according to their own class interests.
