This leads to\nnew existence results for quantum stochastic differential equations. We also give necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a cocycle to satisfy such an equation.\n0. Introduction\nIn this paper we study the functional equation\nV0 = I, Vr+t = Vr\u03c3r (Vt) for all r, t \u0001 0\nfor a family of contractions on h \u2297 F adapted to the Fock operator filtration. Here F is the\nsymmetric Fock space over L2(R+; k), h and k are fixed but arbitrary Hilbert spaces and\n(\u03c3t)t\u00010 is the endomorphism semigroup of shifts, ampliated to B(h \u2297 F). We call such a\nfamily a left contraction cocycle on h with noise dimension space k.\nContraction cocycles may be constructed by solving quantum stochastic differential equa-\ntions of Hudson\u2013Parthasarathy type. By means of a recent characterisation of such cocycles,\nin terms of an associated family of semigroups (Theorem 1\u00b76), we provide a new method\nof constructing cocycles which in turn leads to new existence results for QSDEs. When the\ndriving noise is infinite dimensional the coefficient of a QSDE is naturally given as a ses-\nquilinear operator-valued map or, in terms of a coordinate system for the noise dimension\nspace k, as an infinite matrix [F\u03b1\u03b2 ]. We show that if a process satisfying such a form QSDE\nis contractive and strongly measurable then the coefficient is necessarily given by an op-\nerator, equivalently the matrix must be semiregular. We also give necessary and sufficient\nconditions, of weak differentiability type, for a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle\nto satisfy a QSDE.\nThis paper builds on work of Accardi, Fagnola, Journe\u00b4, Mohari and the authors ([Fa2, Jou,\nMoh, AJL, FaW]), extending known results for Markov-regular cocycles and QSDEs with\nbounded coefficients ([HuP, HuL, LW1, LW2]; see [Mey, L] and references therein). Our\ndevelopment of the theory is coordinate-free, moreover a technical feature of the work is that\n536 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nno separability assumptions are imposed on either the initial space h or the noise dimension\nspace k. This freedom is useful for certain applications such as the stochastic dilation of\nquantum dynamical semigroups ([GS1]). A different approach to the characterisation and\nconstruction of cocycles through semigroup methods has been outlined by Liebscher ([Lie]).\nGeneral notations\nThe algebraic tensor product is denoted \u2297, with \u2297 reserved for the tensor product of\nHilbert spaces and their operators. For a vector \u03be in a Hilbert space K, operators E\u03be : H \u2192\nH \u2297 K and E \u03be : H \u2297 K \u2192 H are defined by\nE\u03beu = u \u2297 \u03be and E \u03be = (E\u03be )\u2217;\nwith context indicating the Hilbert space H, and moreover the elementary tensor u \u2297 \u03be is\nusually abbreviated to u\u03be . Note that \u03be \u0005\u2192 E\u03be is an isometry. For Hilbert spaces H and H\u2032\nand a dense subspace D of H, O(D;H\u2032) denotes the linear space of operators H \u2192 H\u2032 with\ndomain D; O(D) abbreviates O(D;H). For f \u2208 L2(R+; k) and I \u2282 R+, f I denotes the\nfunction that agrees with f on I and is zero elsewhere, and cI denotes the function equal to\nc on I and zero elsewhere, when c is a vector in k.\nFock space\nWe use normalised exponential vectors in F = \u0005(L2(R+; k)), the symmetric Fock\nspace over the Hilbert space L2(R+; k). These are defined by \u0006( f )\u0001\u2016\u03b5( f )\u2016\u22121\u03b5( f ) where\n\u03b5( f ) = (1, f, (2!)\u22121\/2 f \u22972, . . .) for f \u2208 L2(R+; k). The function\n\u03c7 : k \u00d7 k \u2192 C, (c, d) \u0005\u2192 12 (\u2016c\u20162 + \u2016d\u20162) \u2212 \u3008c, d\u3009, (0\u00b71)\nwhich governs their inner product: \u3008\u0006( f ),\u0006(g)\u3009 = exp(\u2212 \u222b \u03c7( f (s), g(s)) ds), also plays\na role. The subspace E(S) := Lin {\u03b5( f ) : f \u2208 S} is dense in F for various useful subsets of\nL2(R+; k), for example\nST\u0001{ f \u2208 S : f is T-valued}\nwhere S\u0001 Lin {c[0,t[ : c \u2208 k, t > 0}, and T is a total subset of k containing 0; we write ET\nfor E(ST). Examples of such sets T include (not necessarily normalised) orthogonal bases,\naugmented by 0.\nWe shall need a refinement of the basic estimate\n\u2016\u0006( f ) \u2212 \u0006(g)\u2016 \u0002 \u2016\u03b5( f ) \u2212 \u03b5(g)\u2016 \u0002 \u2016 f \u2212 g\u2016e 12 (\u2016 f \u2016+\u2016g\u2016)2 (0\u00b72)\nobtained by viewing L2(R+; k) as a subspace of F, namely\n\u2016\u03b5( f ) \u2212 \u03b5(g) \u2212 ( f \u2212 g)\u2016 \u0002 \u2016 f \u2212 g\u2016(\u2016 f \u2016 + \u2016g\u2016)e 12 (\u2016 f \u2016+\u2016g\u2016)2 . (0\u00b73)\nLetting FI denote the symmetric Fock space over L2(I ; k), for a subinterval I of R+,\nthe tensor factorisation F \u0002 F[0,t[ \u2297 F[t,\u221e[ is given by continuous linear extension of the\ncorrespondence\n\u0006( f ) \u2190\u2192 \u0006 ( f |[0,t[)\u0006 ( f |[t,\u221e[).\nOperator processes\nA family of operators (Xt)t\u00010 in B(h \u2297 F) is adapted if\nXt \u2208 B\n(\nh \u2297 F[0,t[\n)\u2297 IF[t,\u221e[ for all t,\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 537\nthat is, if each Xt only acts nontrivially before time t , and is called an (operator) process if\nfurthermore it is weakly measurable (i.e. if t \u0005\u2192 \u3008\u03be, Xt\u03b6 \u3009 is measurable for all \u03be, \u03b6 \u2208 h\u2297F).\nHere we are concerned with contraction operator-valued processes, which we refer to simply\nas contraction processes on h.\nThe right shift st and time reversal map rt on L2(R+; k) are\n(st f )(u) =\n{\n0 if u < t,\nf (u \u2212 t) if u \u0001 t, and (rt f )(u) =\n{\nf (t \u2212 u) if u \u0002 t,\nf (u) if u > t.\nTheir second quantisations ampliated to h \u2297 F are the isometry St and self-adjoint unitary\nRt respectively, given by\nSt u\u03b5( f ) = u\u03b5(st f ), Rt u\u03b5( f ) = u\u03b5(rt f ). (0\u00b74)\nThinking of st as a unitary L2(R+; k)\u2192 L2([t,\u221e[; k) we get the Hilbert space isomorphism\nF\u0002 F[t,\u221e[, and the algebra isomorphism B(h \u2297 F)\u0002 B(h \u2297 F[t,\u221e[). The latter algebra is\nviewed as a subalgebra of the former:\nB(h \u2297 F)\u0002 B(h) \u2297 IF[0,t[ \u2297 B\n(\nF[t,\u221e[\n) \u2282 B(h \u2297 F).\nThen, for Y \u2208 B(h \u2297 F), \u03c3t(Y ) \u2208 B(h \u2297 F) denotes the result of carrying out these identi-\nfications; more concretely it is determined by the identity\n\u3008u\u03b5( f ), \u03c3t(Y )v\u03b5(g)\u3009 = \u3008u\u03b5(s\u2217t f ), Yv\u03b5(s\u2217t g)\u3009\n\u2329\n\u03b5\n( f[0,t[), \u03b5(g[0,t[)\u232a.\nThe family (\u03c3t)t\u00010 is a pointwise weakly continuous semigroup of normal endomorphisms\nof B(h \u2297 F).\nPerturbation\nWe end this introduction by quoting a dissipative generalisation of the Kato-Rellich The-\norem whose symmetric form is well-suited to our purposes. Recall that a C0-semigroup is\ncontractive if and only if its generator is dissipative.\nTHEOREM 0\u00b71. Let A and B be densely defined dissipative operators on a Banach space\nwith the same domain D, and suppose that there are constants \u03bb,\u00b5 \u0001 0 with \u03bb < 1 such\nthat their difference D = A \u2212 B satisfies\n\u2016Dv\u2016 \u0002 \u03bb(\u2016Av\u2016 + \u2016Bv\u2016)+ \u00b5\u2016v\u2016, v \u2208 D. (0\u00b75)\nThen Dom A = Dom B, moreover A is a C0-semigroup generator if and only if B is.\nThis result is due to Gustafson (see [ReS, theorem X\u00b750]). Note that if (0\u00b75) holds then D\nis A-bounded with relative bound at most 2\u03bb\/(1 \u2212 \u03bb).\n1. Cocycles and semigroups\nLeft contraction cocycles on h have been defined in the introduction. An adapted family\nof contractions U = (Ut)t\u00010 on h \u2297 F, satisfying U0 = I and Ur+t = \u03c3r (Ut)Ur for r, t \u0001 0,\nis called a right contraction cocycle. Thus U is a right contraction cocycle if and only if\nU \u2217\u0001(U \u2217t )t\u00010 is a left contraction cocycle.\nThe semigroup decomposition\nFor a contraction process V = (Vt)t\u00010 on h, define the following operators on h:\nVQc,dt = E\u0006(c[0,t[)Vt E\u0006(d[0,t[), c, d \u2208 k, t \u0001 0.\n538 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nThese \u2018sliced\u2019 operators allow one to determine whether or not a process V is a left contrac-\ntion cocycle. Note that they are all contractions.\nPROPOSITION 1\u00b71 ([LW2]). Let V be a contraction process on h, and let T and T\u2020 be\nany total subsets of k containing 0.

The same holds for right contraction cocycles except that the product in (1\u00b71)\nis in the reverse order. It follows that (Ut)t\u00010 is a right contraction cocycle if and only if\n(RtUt Rt)t\u00010 defines a left contraction cocycle, where the operators Rt are defined in (0\u00b74).\nFor a left contraction cocycle V , we refer to the left contraction cocycle defined by\n(Rt V \u2217t Rt)t\u00010 as the (Journe\u00b4) dual of V ([Jou]), and denote it V\u02dc . The associated semigroups\nof the dual cocycle are related to those of V as follows:\nQ\u02dcc,dt =\n(Qd,ct )\u2217. (1\u00b72)\nContinuity\nThe above proposition makes no continuity demands on the time variable of V \u2013 indeed\nit does not even require the weak measurability condition imposed on processes. However\nthe decomposition of a cocycle into its associated semigroups does provide a useful handle\non the continuity of a cocycle.\nLEMMA 1\u00b72. Let V be a left contraction cocycle on h and let {Qc,d : c, d \u2208 k} be its\nassociated semigroups. Then, the following are equivalent:\n(i) V is strongly continuous;\n(ii) V is weakly continuous at 0;\n(iii) for all c, d \u2208 k, Qc,d is strongly continuous;\n(iv) for some a, b \u2208 k, Qa,b is weakly continuous at 0;\nProof. Let c, d \u2208 k and suppose that V is weakly continuous at 0. By adaptedness\u2329\nu, Qc,dt v\n\u232a = \u2329\u0006 (c[t,T [),\u0006 (d[t,T [)\u232a\u22121\u2329u\u0006 (c[0,T [), Vtv\u0006 (d[0,T [)\u232a,\nfor 0\u0002 t \u0002 T and u, v \u2208 h, and so the contraction semigroup Qc,d is weakly continuous at 0\nand thus also strongly continuous, by standard semigroup theory ([Dav, proposition 1\u00b723]).\nThus (ii) implies (iii). Suppose now that Qa,b is weakly continuous at 0 (and thus strongly\ncontinuous) for some a, b \u2208 k, and let t \u0001 r and \u03be = v\u0006( f ) for v \u2208 h and f \u2208 L2(R+; k).\nThen by the cocycle relation, and contractivity and adaptedness of V ,\n\u2016Vt\u03be \u2212 Vr\u03be\u20162 \u0002 \u2016\u03c3r (Vt\u2212r )\u03be \u2212 \u03be\u20162\n\u0002 2 Re \u3008\u03be, (I \u2212 \u03c3r (Vt\u2212r ))\u03be\u3009\n= 2 Re \u2329S\u2217r v\u0006 ( f[r,t[), (I \u2212 Vt\u2212r )S\u2217r v\u0006 ( f[r,t[)\u232a.\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 539\nFor any e \u2208 k let \u03d5er,t = \u0006( f[r,t[) \u2212 \u0006(e[r,t[), so S\u2217r v\u0006( f[r,t[) = S\u2217r v\u03d5er,t + v\u0006(e[0,t\u2212r [), and\nthus the right-hand side of the above is no larger than\n4\u2016v\u20162{\u2225\u2225\u03d5ar,t\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03d5br,t\u2225\u2225+ \u2225\u2225\u03d5ar,t\u2225\u2225+ \u2225\u2225\u03d5br,t\u2225\u2225}+ 2\u2223\u2223\u2329v\u0006 (a[0,t\u2212r [), (I \u2212 Vt\u2212r )v\u0006 (b[0,t\u2212r [)\u232a\u2223\u2223.\nThe first term converges to 0 as t \u2212 r \u2192 0, and the second term equals\n2\n\u2223\u2223\u2329v, (I \u2212 Qa,bt\u2212r)v\u232a+ \u2016v\u20162{exp(r \u2212 t)\u03c7(a, b) \u2212 1}\u2223\u2223,\nhence \u2016(Vt \u2212 Vr )\u03be\u2016\u2192 0 as t \u2212 r \u2192 0 by the assumption on Qa,b. Therefore, since the\ncollection of such vectors \u03be is total, the uniform boundedness of V implies that it is strongly\ncontinuous. Thus (iv) implies (i). Since the implications (i) \u21d2 (ii) and (iii) \u21d2 (iv) are trivial\nthe proof is complete.\nThus, as for semigroups, strong continuity for a left contraction cocycle is equivalent to\nweak continuity at 0, and also to any of its associated semigroups \u2013 in particular its Markov\nsemigroup Q0,0 \u2013 being a C0-semigroup.\nRemark. By the strong continuity of t \u0005\u2192 Rt , Lemma 1\u00b72 is equally true for right con-\ntraction cocycles.\nSuppose that V is a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h. Then each VQc,d\nis a C0-contraction semigroup by Lemma 1\u00b72 and so has a generator GVc,d .

The generators are related by\nH Vc,d \u2212 \u3008c, d\u3009 = GVc,d + \u03c7(c, d),\nwith equality of domains, where \u03c7 is the function defined in (0\u00b71).\nNote also that, from (1\u00b72),\nH V\u02dcc,d =\n(\nH Vd,c\n)\u2217\nand GV\u02dcc,d =\n(\nGVd,c\n)\u2217\n.\nOperators associated with a cocycle\nIn this section the generators of semigroups associated with a strongly continuous left\ncontraction cocycle are compared. This will lead to natural sufficient conditions on their\ndomains for such a cocycle to be governed by a QSDE. First note two consequences of the\nestimates (0\u00b72) and (0\u00b73).

Let V be a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h with noise\ndimension space k and suppose that one of its associated semigroups Qc,d is norm continu-\nous.

In particular Z V = H V0,0 \u2208 B(h), so that DV,0 = h, and hence LV = T V0 which\nis bounded by part (f) of the proposition.\n544 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nSince the semigroups associated to the dual cocycle are the adjoints of those associated\nwith the cocycle, and must also be norm continuous, M V = T V\u02dc\u22170 \u2208 B(h \u2297 k; h), and\nfrom (1\u00b78) it follows that the contraction C V is densely defined, hence C V \u2208 B(h \u2297 k).\nCocycle characterisation through semigroups\nIn Proposition 1\u00b71 we used the family of maps {VQc,dt : c, d \u2208 T, t \u0001 0} defined in terms\nof a given process V to determine whether or not it is a left cocycle. The following result\nturns this around.\nTHEOREM 1\u00b76 ([LW3]). Let QT ={Qc,d : c, d \u2208T} be a family of semigroups on h in-\ndexed by a total subset T of k which contains 0. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) there is a left contraction cocycle V on h whose associated family of semigroups\nincludes QT;\n(ii) for all n \u2208 N, Y \u2208 Mn(|h\u3009) = B(Cn; hn), and positive invertible matrices A, B \u2208\nMn(C), if \u2016A\u22121\/2Y B\u22121\/2\u2016 \u0002 1 then\u2225\u2225(A \u2022\u0001 ct )\u22121\/2(Qct \u2022 Y )(B \u2022\u0001 ct )\u22121\/2\u2225\u2225 \u0002 1, (1\u00b721)\nfor all c \u2208 Tn, t \u0001 0.\nThis requires some explanation of terms: |h\u3009\u0001B(C; h), the column operator space de-\ntermined by h ([EfR, Pis]); given c, d \u2208 k, \u0006 c,dt = \u3008\u0006(c[0,t[),\u0006(d[0,t[)\u3009 = exp \u2212t\u03c7(c, d),\nand given c \u2208 kn , \u0001 ct\u0001[\u0006 ci ,c jt ] \u2208 Mn(C) = B(Cn), Qct\u0001[Qci ,c jt ] \u2208 Mn(B(h)) = B(hn),\nthe symbol \u2022 denotes the Schur product of matrices, so in particular if T =[|uij \u3009] then\nQct \u2022T =[|Qci ,c jt uij \u3009] \u2208 B(Cn; hn); finally, the first matrix within each of the norms is thought\nof as having entries of the form \u03bd Ih for \u03bd \u2208 C, thus both norms are those of B(Cn; hn).\nWhat this result tells us is that if we can find a family of semigroups QT on h, indexed by a\ntotal subset T of k containing 0, which satisfies (1\u00b721) then there is an associated cocycle V\non h. This condition, on a putative family of semigroups QT, looks hard to verify. However\nthe strength of the result lies in the fact that it is manifestly stable under pointwise limits.\nTHEOREM 1\u00b77. Let QT = {Qc,d : c, d \u2208 T} be a family of semigroups on h, indexed by\na total subset T of k which includes 0. Suppose that there is a sequence (V (n))n\u00011 of left\ncontraction cocycles on h whose associated semigroups satisfy\n(n)Qc,dt \u2192 Qc,dt pointwise on h,\nfor all c, d \u2208 T and t > 0. Then there is a unique left contraction cocycle V on h whose\nassociated semigroups include the family QT. Moreover V (n)t \u2192 Vt in the weak operator\ntopology for each t.\nProof. The existence of V is immediate from Theorem 1\u00b76, uniqueness follows from the\ntotality of T, and the convergence V (n) \u2192 V is a consequence of (1\u00b71) and contractivity.\n2.

Let \u03be \u2208 D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D). Then \u03be is expressible in the form u0e0 + \u2211ni=1 ui c\u0302i for\nsome u0 \u2208 D0, n \u2208 N, u1, . . . , un \u2208 D and c1, . . . , cn \u2208 T.

Using the continuity of the integrand at the\norigin, letting t \u2192 0 and then letting T \u2192 0 now gives the result.\nRemarks. (i) If it is assumed further that all the T-components (Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 : c, d \u2208 T) are\nbounded, then (2\u00b72) may be solved by Picard iteration and Mohari and Fagnola showed\nthat (2\u00b74) is also sufficient for contractivity of the solution. In fact boundedness of T-\ncomponents and contractivity of the solution implies that F itself is bounded ([LW1,\ntheorem 7\u00b75]) so that (2\u00b74) simplifies to the operator inequality\nF + F\u2217 + F\u2217\rF \u0002 0. (2\u00b75)\nThe solution is also unique amongst T\u2020-weak solutions (cf. Theorem 2\u00b73 below).\n(ii) Since the integrability condition for being a strong solution is automatically satis-\nfied by strongly measurable contraction processes, any strongly measurable weak solution\nof (2\u00b72) is necessarily a strong solution on the same domain.\nWe next show how the assumption of strong measurability also renders form solutions\ninto strong operator solutions.\nTHEOREM 2\u00b72. Let V be a strongly measurable contraction process on h with noise di-\nmension space k, let T be a total subset of k containing 0 and let D0 \u2283 D be dense subspaces\nof h. Set D = Lin T, and assume that D has an orthonormal basis. If V is a T-T-solution of\nthe form QSDE (2\u00b71) on D0 \u2297 \u03b5(0) + D\u2297ET, and each map \u03be \u0005\u2192 F(\u03be, \u03b7)v is continuous\nthen F is the component map of an operator F \u2208 O(D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D)) and V satisfies the\ncorresponding operator QSDE (2\u00b72) strongly on the same domain.\nProof. By the second remark above it suffices to show that F is necessarily the component\nmap of an operator F \u2208 O(D0\u2295(D\u2297D)). For any subspace h of k of the form Lin T0 where\nT0 is a finite subset of T, define an operator Fh \u2208 O(D0 \u2295 (D\u2297 h)) by\nFh =\n\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nEe\u03b1F(e\u03b1, e\u03b2)E\ne\u03b2\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 547\nwhere (e\u03b1) is an orthonormal basis for h\u0302 which includes the vector e0 =\n(1\n0\n)\n.

Then, for\n(v, \u03b7) \u2208 (D \u00d7 C(0d)) \u0002 (D0 \u00d7 Ce0) where d \u2208 T and I0 a finite subset of I , applying (2\u00b76)\nwith h = Lin ({d} \u0002 {di : i \u2208 I0}) gives\u2211\ni\u2208I0\n\u2016F(ei , \u03b7)v\u20162 =\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2211\ni\u2208I0\nEei E\nei Fhv\u03b7\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n2\n\u0002 \u2016\rFhv\u03b7\u20162 \u0002 \u22122 Re \u3008v,F(\u03b7, \u03b7)v\u3009,\nand so the orthogonal sum\n\u2211\ni\u2208I Eei F(ei , \u03b7)v is convergent. Thus an operator F \u2208 O(D0 \u2295\n(D\u2297D)) is defined by linear extension of the prescription\nv\u03b7 \u0005\u2212\u2192\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208 I\u0302\nEe\u03b1F(e\u03b1, \u03b7)v.\nBy the continuity assumption on F, E \u03be Fv\u03b7 = F(\u03be, \u03b7)v for \u03be \u2208 D\u0302 and v\u03b7 as above, and it\nfollows that F is independent of the choice of basis (di)i\u2208I , hence is the component map of\nF: E \u03be F E\u03b7 = F(\u03be, \u03b7) for \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 D\u0302. This completes the proof.\nRemarks. Dixmier showed that a pre-Hilbert space need not have an orthonormal basis\n([Bou, V\u00b770]); however the assumption on D is automatically satisfied if either the Hilbert\nspace k is separable or the set T contains a subset which is orthogonal and total.\nSince contraction processes satisfying the form QSDE are weakly continuous, the strong\nmeasurability assumption is redundant when h and k are both separable or, in view of\nLemma 1\u00b72, when the solution is a left cocycle.\nThis connects with issues of uniqueness.\nTHEOREM 2\u00b73. Let F be a sesquilinear map D\u0302\u2020 \u00d7 D\u0302\u2192O(D), where D is a dense sub-\nspace of h, D\u2020 = Lin T\u2020 and D = Lin T for total subsets T\u2020 and T of k that contain 0.\n(a) Suppose that T\u2020 =RT\u2020 and T=RT. If K\u0001F(e0, e0) is a pregenerator of a C0-\ncontraction semigroup on h then the form QSDE (2\u00b71) has at most one contractive\nT\u2020-T-solution on D\u2297ET.\n(b) If the form QSDE (2\u00b71) has a unique contractive T\u2020-T-solution V on D\u2297ET then V\nis a left contraction cocycle.\n(c) If the form QSDE (2\u00b71) has a T\u2020-T-solution V on D\u2297ET which is a left contraction\ncocycle then D \u2282 DV,D and Ec\u0302 F V Ed\u0302 |D = F(\u0302c, d\u0302) for all c \u2208 D\u2020, d \u2208 D.\n548 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nPart (a) is Mohari\u2019s Uniqueness Theorem ([Moh]). The invariance of T (and T\u2020) under\nscalar multiplication can be weakened to the following:\nfor each d \u2208 T there exists \u0010 > 0 such that [0, \u0010]d \u2282 T,\nwhich is sufficiently strong to allow differentiation at a crucial stage in his argument. It is\nclear from Meyer\u2019s treatment ([Mey, page 191]) that the result remains valid in this gener-\nality. Part (b) is proved by verifying that, for each t > 0,\nV ts =\n{\nVs if s \u0002 t,\nVt\u03c3t(Vs\u2212t) if s > t,\ndefines a contraction process V t which also satisfies (2\u00b71). This is easily checked by treating\nh \u2297 F[0,t[ as an initial space and using the explicit action of shifts on exponential vectors.\nProof of part (c). Pick u \u2208 h, v \u2208 D, c \u2208 T\u2020 and d \u2208 T, and set f = c[0,1[ and g = d[0,1[.\nThen for all 0 < t < 1\n\u3008u\u03b5( f ), (Vt \u2212 I )v\u03b5(g)\u3009 =\n\u222b t\n0\n\u3008u\u03b5( f ), VsF(\u0302c, d\u0302)v\u03b5(g)\u3009 ds.\nBut, for the same t ,\u2329\nu,\n(\nPc,dt \u2212 I\n)\nv\n\u232a = \u3008u\u03b5( f ), (Vt \u2212 I )v\u03b5(g)\u3009e(t\u22121)\u3008c,d\u3009 + (et\u3008c,d\u3009 \u2212 1)\u3008c, d\u3009\u3008u, v\u3009\nand consequently\nlim\nt\u21920\nt\u22121\n\u2329\nu,\n(\nPc,dt \u2212 I\n)\nv\n\u232a = \u3008u, (F(\u0302c, d\u0302) \u2212 \u3008c, d\u3009)v\u3009.\nSince this holds for all u \u2208 h it follows that v \u2208 Dom H Vc,d and that F(\u0302c, d\u0302) \u2212 \u3008c, d\u3009 \u2282 H Vc,d\nfor all c \u2208 D\u2020 and d \u2208 D ([Dav, theorem 1\u00b724]). Hence D \u2282 DV,D and so Ec\u0302 F V Ed\u0302 |D =\nF(\u0302c, d\u0302) by (1\u00b720).\n3. Necessary conditions for contractive solution\nIn this section we explore necessary conditions on F for the existence of contractive solu-\ntions of (2\u00b72). Recall that densely defined dissipative operators are closable with dissipative\nclosures.\nPROPOSITION 3\u00b71. Let F \u2208 O(D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D)), for dense subspaces D0 \u2283 D of h and D\nof k, have block matrix form [ K ML C\u2212I ] and satisfy the form inequality (2\u00b74). For each c \u2208 k\nand d \u2208 D define G0c,d\u0001Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(c, d). Then:\n(a) C is a contraction and, for all u \u2208 D0,\n\u2016Lu\u20162 + 2 Re \u3008u, K u\u3009 \u0002 0; (3\u00b71)\n(b) F and G0c,d are dissipative; let Gc,d = G0c,d and Z = G0,0 = K ;\n(c) L is G0c,d-bounded, with relative bound 0, on Dom G0c,d ;\n(d) for each a \u2208 k, G0a,d is a relatively bounded perturbation of G0c,d with relative bound\n0, Dom Ga,d = Dom Gc,d , and Ga,d is a C0-semigroup generator if and only if Gc,d\nis;\n(e) Dom M\u2217 \u2283 Dom K and, for all u \u2208 D0,\n\u2016(L + C M\u2217)u\u20162 + \u2016M\u2217u\u20162 + 2 Re \u3008u, K u\u3009 \u0002 0, (3\u00b72)\nin particular, M\u2217 is K -bounded with relative bound 0;\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 549\n(f) F also satisfies (2\u00b74), moreover F \u2283 F \u2032 where F \u2032 = [ Z ML \u2032 C\u2212I ], L \u2032 being the continu-\nous extension (in the graph norm of Z ) of L to Dom Z.\nProof. For \u03be = (u\n\u03b7\n) \u2208 D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D), (2\u00b74) is equivalent to\n\u2016Lu + C\u03b7\u20162 \u0002 \u22122 Re \u3008u, K u + M\u03b7\u3009 + \u2016\u03b7\u20162, (3\u00b73)\nand setting u = 0, respectively \u03b7 = 0, shows that (a) holds. Now abbreviate Ec L , M Ed and\nEcC Ed to Lc, Md and Ccd respectively, and denote Dom G0c,d by D0d , thus\nG0c,d = K + Lc + Md + Ccd \u2212 12\u2016c\u20162 \u2212 12\u2016d\u20162,\nwhere D0d = D0 if d = 0 and equals D otherwise.\nIf \u03b7 = ud where d \u2208 D and u \u2208 D0d then (3\u00b73) reads\n\u2016(L + Cd)u\u20162 \u0002 \u22122 Re \u3008u,\n(\nK + Md \u2212 12\u2016d\u20162\n)\nu\u3009,\nso, for c \u2208 k and d \u2208 D,\n\u22122 Re \u2329u, G0c,du\u232a = \u22122 Re \u2329u, {(K + Md \u2212 12\u2016d\u20162)+ (Lc + Ccd \u2212 12\u2016c\u20162)}u\u232a\n\u0001 \u2016(L + Cd)u\u20162 \u2212 2 Re \u3008uc, (L + Cd)u\u3009 + \u2016uc\u20162\n= \u2016(L + Cd \u2212 Ec)u\u20162\nfor all u \u2208 D0d . Thus G0c,d is dissipative, moreover\n\u2016(L + Cd \u2212 Ec)u\u2016 \u0002\n\u221a\n\u22122 Re \u2329\u03bb\u22121u, \u03bbG0c,du\u232a \u0002 \u03bb\u2225\u2225G0c,du\u2225\u2225+ \u03bb\u22121\u2016u\u2016\nfor all \u03bb > 0 and so, since (Cd \u2212 Ec) is bounded, L is G0c,d-bounded with relative bound\n0. Since F is clearly dissipative, we have established (b) and (c). Since G0a,d \u2212 G0c,d =\nEa\u2212c L +Ca\u2212cd + 12 (\u2016c\u20162 \u2212\u2016a\u20162) it also follows that G0a,d is a relatively bounded perturbation\nof G0c,d with relative bound 0, and so (d) follows from Gustafson\u2019s Theorem.\nNow let u \u2208 D0. Then, from (3\u00b73), 2|\u3008u, M\u03b7\u3009| \u0002 \u2016\u03b7\u20162 \u2212 2 Re \u3008u, K u\u3009 for each \u03b7 \u2208\nD\u2297 D. This implies that u \u2208 Dom M\u2217. Thus Dom M\u2217 \u2283 D0 and (3\u00b73) reads \u2016Lu +C\u03b7\u20162 +\n2 Re \u3008M\u2217u, \u03b7\u3009+2 Re \u3008u, K u\u3009 \u0002 \u2016\u03b7\u20162, now valid for u \u2208 D0 and \u03b7 \u2208 h\u2297k. Putting \u03b7 = M\u2217u\ngives (3\u00b72), in particular\n\u2016M\u2217u\u20162 \u0002 2|\u3008u, K u\u3009| \u0002 (\u03bb\u2016K u\u2016 + \u03bb\u22121\u2016u\u2016)2\nfor \u03bb > 0, showing that (e) holds. Since F is densely defined and dissipative it is closable\nand it is easily verified that its closure contains F \u2032, and that it inherits the property (2\u00b74) from\nF . Thus (f) holds too and the proof is complete.\nRemarks. (i) The form inequality (2\u00b74) is therefore equivalent to (3\u00b71) together with con-\ntractivity of C , the inclusion Dom M\u2217 \u2283 D0 and the following inequality holding for u \u2208 D0\nand \u03b7 \u2208 h \u2297 k:\n|\u3008(M\u2217 + C\u2217L)u, \u03b7\u3009|2 \u0002 (2 Re \u3008u, (\u2212K )u\u3009 \u2212 \u2016Lu\u20162)(\u2016\u03b7\u20162 \u2212 \u2016C\u03b7\u20162).\nIf equality holds in (2\u00b74) then C is isometric and \u2016Lu\u20162 + 2 Re \u3008u, K u\u3009 = 0 for all u \u2208 D0,\nin turn, if either of these conditions hold then M\u2217 \u2283 \u2212C\u2217L .\n(ii) In view of (f), the proposition still holds if K , L and C are replaced by Z , L \u2032 and C\nrespectively, and M is replaced by the restriction of M to any dense subspace of its domain\nof the form D\u20321 \u2297D\u2032.\n550 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nPROPOSITION 3\u00b72. Let F and F \u2032 be as in Proposition 3\u00b71. Suppose that Z is a generator\nof a C0-semigroup and let F (n)\u0001 I (n)\u2217F I (n), where I (n) = diag [J (n), Ih\u2297k] \u2208 B(h \u2297 k\u0302),\nJ (n) being the contraction (I \u2212 n\u22121 Z)\u22121. Then F (n) is bounded and its closure satisfies the\noperator inequality (2\u00b75), and F (n) \u2192 F pointwise on D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D).\nProof. Note first that I (n) leaves Dom F \u2032 invariant, and that \rI (n) =\r. Thus for \u03be \u2208\nDom F , putting \u03ben = I (n)\u03be ,\n2 Re\n\u2329\n\u03be, F (n)\u03be\n\u232a+ \u2225\u2225\rF (n)\u03be\u2225\u22252 = 2 Re \u3008\u03ben, F\u03ben\u3009 + \u2016\rF\u03ben\u20162 \u0002 0,\nby Proposition 3\u00b71, thus F (n) satisfies the form inequality (2\u00b74). Now let [ K (n) M (n)L(n) C\u2212I ] be the\nblock matrix form of F (n). Since K (n) = J (n)\u2217Z J (n) \u2208 B(h) it follows from Proposition 3\u00b71\nthat L (n) and M (n)\u2217 are bounded, and so F (n) is bounded, hence extends to h \u2297 k\u0302. Thus F (n)\nsatisfies the operator inequality (2\u00b75). Now (J (n)) and (J (n)\u2217) are sequences of contractions\nwhich converge strongly to I and, for v \u2208 Dom Z , J (n)v \u2192 v in the graph norm of Z .\nThus K (n) \u2192 Z on D0, L (n) = L \u2032 J (n) \u2192 L on D0 (since L \u2032 is Z -bounded) and M (n) =\nJ (n)\u2217M \u2192 M on D\u2297D. In other words F (n) \u2192 F pointwise on D0 \u2295 (D\u2297D).\n4. Stochastic Hille\u2013Yosida\nIn this section we obtain the stochastic generator of a strongly continuous left contraction\ncocycle \u2013 when it has one; an existence theorem for the QSDE (2\u00b72) is established; and some\nexamples are discussed. We also briefly describe the situation when k is separable and has a\ngiven orthonormal basis.\nStochastic generator of a cocycle\nWe first show that strongly continuous left contraction cocycles satisfy a quantum\nstochastic differential equation under a minimal condition for the equation to make sense \u2013\nnamely that there is an available dense domain for a coefficient operator to act on. It amounts\nto a weak-differentiability condition (cf. [AJL, Fa2]). Recall the notation (1\u00b718) and the\nidentities (1\u00b719) and (1\u00b720).\nTHEOREM 4\u00b71. Let V be a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h with noise\ndimension space k, let T\u2020 and T be total subsets of k containing 0, and let D= Lin T,\nD\u2020 = Lin T\u2020 and Z = H V0,0. If DV,T is dense in h then the following hold.(a) For F = F V,T, the process V satisfies the operator QSDE (2\u00b72) strongly on DV,0 \u2297\n\u03b5(0) + DV,T \u2297ED.\n(b) If D is a core for Z contained in DV,T, then V is the unique contractive D\u2020-weak\nsolution of (2\u00b72) on D\u2297ED, for F = F V,T|D\u2297 D\u0302.\n(c) If DV\u02dc ,T\u2020 is also dense in h then (F V,T)\u2217 \u2283 F V\u02dc ,T\u2020 .\nProof. (a) Since V is strongly measurable and contractive it suffices to show that V is\na k-weak solution by the second remark after Proposition 2\u00b71. But this follows from the\nsemigroup representation as follows. Let u \u2208 h, f \u2208 S and (v, g) \u2208 (DV,0 \u00d7 {0})\u0002 (DV,D \u00d7\nSD). Then by adaptedness and the semigroup representation (1\u00b71),\n\u3008u\u03b5( f ), Vtv\u03b5(g)\u3009 =\n\u2329\nu, P f (t0),g(t0)t1\u2212t0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 P f (tn),g(tn)t\u2212tn v\n\u232a\ne\n\u222b\u221e\nt \u3008 f (s),g(s)\u3009 ds,\nand since DV,D \u2282 Dom H Vc,d for all c \u2208 k and d \u2208 D by Corollary 1\u00b74, the (a.e.) derivative\nof this with respect to t is\u2329\nu, P f (t0),g(t0)t1\u2212t0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 P f (tn),g(tn)t\u2212tn\n(\nH f (tn),g(tn) \u2212 \u3008 f (t), g(t)\u3009\n)\nv\n\u232a\ne\n\u222b\u221e\nt \u3008 f (s),g(s)\u3009 ds,\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 551\nin other words \u3008u\u03b5( f ), Vt E f\u0302 (t)F Eg\u0302(t)v\u03b5(g)\u3009 by (1\u00b720). Thus V satisfies (2\u00b72) k-weakly on\nDV,0 \u2297 \u03b5(0) + DV,D \u2297ED.\n(b) This follows from Theorem 2\u00b73.\n(c) This follows from (1\u00b716): (F V,T)\u2217 \u2283 (F V )\u2217 \u2283 F V\u02dc \u2283 F V\u02dc ,T\u2020 .\nRemark. By Corollary 1\u00b75 if V is Markov-regular then F V \u2208 B(h \u2297 k\u0302), so DV,k = h and\nhence V satisfies the operator QSDE on h\u2297Ek for this bounded operator \u2013 this is theorem 6\u00b77\nof [LW2].\nThe theorem also extends the main result of [AJL] to infinite dimensional noise. Note\nthat an application of the Banach\u2013Steinhaus Theorem is needed there in order to show that\nthe form QSDE coefficient is actually the component map of an operator. In infinite dimen-\nsions the same argument again leads to a form QSDE for V , however the Banach\u2013Steinhaus\nTheorem does not help in this case. The above result therefore also fills a gap in the proof of\ntheorem 2\u00b74 of [Fa2].\nFrom this result and part (c) of Theorem 2\u00b73 we may now give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a contraction cocycle to satisfy a QSDE.\nTHEOREM 4\u00b72. Let V be a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h with noise\ndimension space k. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) DV,T is dense in h for some total subset T of k containing 0;\n(ii) V strongly satisfies a QSDE of the form (2\u00b72) on some domain of the form D0 \u2297\n\u03b5(0) + D\u2297ED;\n(iii) V is a T\u2020-T-solution of a form QSDE (2\u00b71) on some domain of the form D\u2297ET.\nRemark. Thus if V is a left contraction cocycle on h which satisfies a QSDE of the\ntype (2\u00b72) on DV,0 \u2297 \u03b5(0) + DV,T \u2297ED, where D = Lin T , then\nF = F V,D.\nCoordinates\nSuppose that k is separable with orthonormal basis \u03b7 = (di )i\u00011, and set d0\u00010. Let V be\na strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h and suppose that D = \u22c2\u03b1,\u03b2 Dom G(\u03b1,\u03b2)\nis dense in h, where G(\u03b1,\u03b2) denotes the generator GVc,d for c = d\u03b1 and d = d\u03b2 . Then The-\norem 4\u00b71 ensures that V strongly satisfies a Hudson\u2013Parthasarathy equation\ndVt = Vt F\u03b1\u03b2 d\u000e\u03b2\u03b1(t), V0 = I,\nin which [F\u03b1\u03b2 ]\u03b1,\u03b2\u00010 is the matrix of components of an operator F \u2208 O(D \u2297 D\u0302) where D =\nLin \u03b7 \u2013 in other words the matrix is semiregular in the sense that\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u00010\u2016F\u03b1\u03b2 v\u20162 < \u221e for all\n\u03b2 \u0001 0 and v \u2208 D.

MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nCocycles from stochastic generators\nOur treatment of the existence question for (2\u00b72) is founded on the following infinitesimal\nversion of Theorem 1\u00b77.\nPROPOSITION 4\u00b73. Let QT = {Qc,d : c, d \u2208 T} be a family of C0-contraction semigroups\non h, indexed by a total subset T of k containing 0 and let Gc,d denote the generator of\nthe semigroup Qc,d . Suppose that there is a sequence of strongly continuous left contraction\ncocycles (V (n)) on h and, for each c, d \u2208 T, a core Dc,d for Gc,d such that:\n(a) Dc,d \u2282 DV (n),T for each n \u2208 N, and\n(b) Ec\u0302 F (n)Ed\u0302 \u2212\u03c7(c, d) \u2192 Gc,d pointwise on Dc,d , for all c, d \u2208 T, where F (n)\u0001F V (n),T.\nThen there is a unique strongly continuous left contraction cocycle V whose associated\nsemigroups include QT. Moreover V (n) \u2192 V in the weak operator topology.\nProof. We use the notation (n)Qc,d and G(n)c,d for semigroups and generators associated with\nthe cocycle V (n). Condition (a) and Corollary 1\u00b74 imply that Dc,d \u2297 D\u0302 \u2282 Dom F (n), where\nD = Lin T, so each F (n) is densely defined, and also Ec\u0302 F (n)Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(c, d) \u2282 G(n)c,d by (1\u00b720).\nHence, by the Trotter\u2013Kato Theorem ([Dav, corollary 3\u00b718]), assumption (b) implies that\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e supt\u2208[0,T ]\n\u2225\u2225((n)Qc,dt \u2212 Qc,dt )u\u2225\u2225 \u2212\u2192 0\nfor all c, d \u2208 T, u \u2208 h and T > 0. The result therefore follows by Theorem 1\u00b77 and\nLemma 1\u00b72.\nRemark. This result is a stochastic generalisation of the Trotter\u2013Kato Theorem. In the\nusual version pointwise convergence of the generators implies convergence of the sequence\nof semigroups in the strong operator topology. However a similar strengthening of the con-\nclusion for cocycles is not possible \u2013 as can be demonstrated using the conditions for iso-\nmetricity of cocycles given in terms of conservativity of an associated quantum dynamical\nsemigroup. See [LW4] for details.\nTHEOREM 4\u00b74. Let F \u2208 O(D\u2297 D\u0302) where D is a dense subspace of h and D = Lin T for\na total subset T of k containing 0. Assume that:\n(a) for each c, d \u2208 T, E c\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212\u03c7(c, d) is a pregenerator of a C0-contraction semigroup\nQc,d ; and\n(b) there is a sequence (F (n)) in B(h \u2297 k\u0302) satisfying the operator inequality (2\u00b75), such\nthat, for all c, d \u2208 T,\nE c\u0302 F (n)Ed\u0302 \u2212\u2192 Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 pointwise on D.\nThen F \u2282 F V,T for a unique strongly continuous left contraction cocycle V on h. Moreover,\nfor all c \u2208 k and d \u2208 T,\nGVc,d = Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(c, d), and (4\u00b71)\nGV\u02dcd,c \u2283 Ed\u0302 F\u2217Ec\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(d, c). (4\u00b72)\nProof. By Theorems 2\u00b73 and 4\u00b71, assumption (a) (with c = d = 0) implies uniqueness.\nLet Gc,d be the generator of Qc,d and let V (n) be the strongly continuous left contraction\ncocycle generated by F (n) (see the remark following Proposition 2\u00b71). Then the hypotheses\nof Proposition 4\u00b73 are satisfied with Dc,d = D for each c, d \u2208 T. Let V be the resulting\ncocycle. Then GVc,d = Gc,d so Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2282 GVc,d +\u03c7(c, d) and therefore DV,T \u2283 D. This gives\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 553\nF V,T \u2283 F and so GVc,d \u2283 Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(c, d) for all c \u2208 k and d \u2208 D, by (1\u00b720). Now D is a\ncore for GVc,d when c, d \u2208 T so, by part (b) of Proposition 1\u00b73, it is also a core when c \u2208 k.\nThe above inclusion is therefore an equality. It remains only to verify the inclusion (4\u00b72), but\nsince GV\u02dcd,c = (GVc,d)\u2217 this follows by taking adjoints.\nRemarks. Under the conditions of the theorem, if also Dom F\u2217 \u2283 D\u2020 \u2297 D\u0302\u2020, for dense\nsubspaces D\u2020 and D\u2020 of h and k respectively, then DV\u02dc ,D\u2020 contains the dense subspace D\u2020 so\nV\u02dc strongly satisfies the QSDE (2\u00b72) with coefficient F V\u02dc ,D\u2020 on DV\u02dc ,0 \u2297 \u03b5(0) + DV\u02dc ,D\u2020 \u2297ED\u2020 ,\nand F\u2217 \u2283 F V\u02dc ,D\u2020 . In particular, F\u2217 satisfies the form inequality (2\u00b74) on DV\u02dc ,0\u2295(DV\u02dc ,D\u2020 \u2297D\u2020).\nOur next result extends Fagnola\u2019s existence theorem ([Fa2]). Whereas his proof requires\nseparability of both of the Hilbert spaces h and k, ours requires a strengthening of his condi-\ntion which amounts to K being a pregenerator of a C0-semigroup. This difference in hypo-\ntheses reflects our difference of approach. Whereas he approximates the solution process by\nadapting Frigerio\u2019s diagonalisation argument with the Arzela`\u2013Ascoli Theorem to cocycles\nconstructed from bounded stochastic generators, we approximate a sufficient number of the\nassociated semigroup generators by exploiting the Trotter\u2013Kato Theorem and this demands\nstronger core requirements.\nTHEOREM 4\u00b75. Let F \u2208 O(D\u2297 D\u0302), with block matrix form [ K ML C\u2212I ], where D is a dense\nsubspace of h and D = Lin T for a total subset T of k containing 0. Suppose that:\n(a) 2 Re \u3008\u03be, F\u03be\u3009 + \u2016\rF\u03be\u20162 \u0002 0 for all \u03be \u2208 D\u2297 D\u0302; and\n(b) K + M Ed \u2212 12\u2016d\u20162 is a pregenerator of a C0-semigroup, for each d \u2208 T.\nThen F \u2282 F V,T for a unique strongly continuous left contraction cocycle V on h,\nmoreover (4\u00b71) and (4\u00b72) hold.\nProof. By Proposition 3\u00b71, assumption (a) implies that G0c,d\u0001Ec\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(c, d) is dis-\nsipative and Gc,d\u0001G0c,d generates a C0-contraction semigroup if and only if Gb,d does, for\nb, c \u2208 k and d \u2208 D. Since K + M Ed \u2212 1\/2\u2016d\u20162 = G00,d , this operator is dissipative for each\nd \u2208 D and assumption (b) is equivalent to G0,d being a C0-semigroup generator for each\nd \u2208 T. Therefore Gc,d is such a generator for each c \u2208 k and d \u2208 T. In view of Propo-\nsition 3\u00b72, Theorem 4\u00b74 therefore applies.\nCOROLLARY 4\u00b76. If condition (b) of Theorem 4\u00b75 is replaced by:\n(bi) Ran (\u03bbI \u2212 K ) is dense in h for some \u03bb > 0; and\n(bii) M Ed is K -bounded, for each d \u2208 T,\nthen the conclusion of the theorem holds, moreover\nDom GVe,d \u2283 Dom K for all e \u2208 k and d \u2208 D,\nwith equality when d is a sufficiently small multiple of an element of T.\nProof. Since K is dissipative (bi) is equivalent to K being a C0-contraction semigroup\ngenerator, by the Lumer\u2013Phillips Theorem ([Dav, theorem 2\u00b725]). For \u03b1 > 0 let T\u03b1 = {(\u03b1+\n\u03bbd)\n\u22121d : d \u2208 T}, where \u03bbd is the relative bound of M Ed with respect to K , thus Lin T\u03b1 = D\nand M Ed has relative bound less than one for each d \u2208 T\u03b1. Using Proposition 3\u00b71 once\nmore this means that, for each e \u2208 k and d \u2208 T\u03b1, Ee\u0302 F Ed\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7(e, d) is a relatively bounded\nperturbation of K with relative bound less than one. Therefore, by Gustafson\u2019s Theorem, its\nclosure has the same domain as K and is a C0-contraction semigroup generator, so (b) of\n554 J. MARTIN LINDSAY AND STEPHEN J. WILLS\nTheorem 4\u00b75 holds (with T\u03b1 in place of T) and the theorem applies. We have\nDom GVe,d = Dom K for e \u2208 k, d \u2208 T\u03b1 and \u03b1 > 0.\nThe proof therefore follows by Corollary 1\u00b74 since D = Lin T \u03b1.\nRemark. By choosing suitable functions \u00b5 and \u03bb in the example below, it is possible\nto find an operator F \u2208 O(D\u2297 D\u0302) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 4\u00b75 but whose\ncoefficients Md are not K -bounded, so that F is not covered by the corollary above.\nDualising we obtain alternative conditions.\nCOROLLARY 4\u00b77. Let F \u2208 O(D\u2297 D\u0302) and F\u2020 \u2208 O(D\u2020 \u2297 D\u0302\u2020) be densely defined op-\nerators on h \u2297 k\u0302 with block matrix forms [ K ML C\u2212I ] and [ K \u2020 L\u2020M\u2020 C\u2020\u2212I ] respectively, satisfying\nF\u2217 \u2283 F\u2020, where D = Lin T for a total subset T of k containing 0. Then the conclusions of\nTheorem 4\u00b75 hold under the conditions:\n(a) F and F\u2020 satisfy the form inequality (2\u00b74);\n(bi) K \u2020 is a pregenerator of a C0-semigroup on h; and\n(bii) D is a core for the operator (K \u2020 + Ed M\u2020 \u2212 (1\/2)\u2016d\u2016)\u2217, for each d \u2208 T.\nProof. In view of assumption (bi), Proposition 3\u00b71 applied to F\u2020 shows that (K \u2020+Ed M\u2020\u2212\n(1\/2)\u2016d\u20162) is a pregenerator of a C0-contraction semigroup. Assumption (bii) therefore im-\nplies that its closure is (K + M Ed \u2212 (1\/2)\u2016d\u20162)\u2217, thus (K + M Ed \u2212 (1\/2)\u2016d\u20162) is a pre-\ngenerator of a C0-contraction semigroup and so Theorem 4\u00b75 applies.\nMany examples are covered by the following consequence of Theorem 4\u00b75, with C typic-\nally being unitary.\nTHEOREM 4\u00b78. Let H be a closed symmetric operator on h, L a closed operator h \u2192\nh \u2297 k, C a contraction operator on h \u2297 k and T a total subset of k containing 0, such that\nD\u0001 Dom H \u0001 Dom L\u2217L \u0001\n\u22c2\nd\u2208T Dom L\u2217C Ed is dense in h, and let F =\n[ K \u2212L\u2217C\nL C\u2212I\n]\u2223\u2223\nD\u2297 D\u0302\nwhere K = i H \u2212 (1\/2)L\u2217L and D = Lin T. Then the following hold.\n(a) (i) F satisfies (2\u00b74), with equality if and only if C is isometric.\n(ii) If there are constants \u03b3d > 0 (d \u2208 T) such that(\n\u03b3d I + 12 L\u2217L + L\u2217C Ed \u2212 i H\n)\nD is dense in h.\nthen F generates a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle on h.\n(b) Suppose that D\u2020\u0001 Dom H \u2217 \u0001 Dom L\u2217L \u0001\u22c2d\u2208T\u2020 Dom L\u2217Ed is dense in h, and let\nD\u2020 = Lin T\u2020 for another total subset of k containing 0. Then:\n(i) F\u2217 satisfies (2\u00b74) on D\u2020 \u2297 D\u0302\u2020, with equality if and only if C is coisometric on\nh \u2297 k;\n(ii) if there are constants \u03b3d > 0 (d \u2208 T\u2020) such that(\n\u03b3d I + 12 L\n\u2217L \u2212 L\u2217Ed + i H \u2217\n)\nD\u2020 is dense in h\nthen F\u2020\u0001F\u2217|D\u2020 \u2297 D\u0302\u2020 generates a strongly continuous left contraction cocycle.\nExamples in which C = I and H = 0 have arisen recently in the problem of constructing\nstochastic dilations of tracially-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups ([GS2]). In this case\nit suffices for D to be a core for the positive selfadjoint operator L\u2217L , and for L\u2217Ed (d \u2208 T)\nto be relatively bounded with respect to L\u2217L .\nQuantum stochastic operator cocycles 555\nLet D be the linear span of the standard orthonormal basis of h\u0001l2(Z+), let\nF =\n[\n\u03bd(N ) W \u2217\u03bb(N )\n\u2212\u03bb(N )W 0\n]\n, where \u03bd(n) = i\u00b5(n) \u2212 12 |\u03bb|2(n + 1),\nwhere W and N denote respectively the isometric right shift on h and the number operator\non h, and \u03bb : Z+ \u2192C and \u00b5 : Z+ \u2192R are arbitrary functions. Then F\u2217 + F + F\u2217\rF\nand F + F\u2217 + F\rF\u2217 both vanish on D \u2295 D and Theorem 4\u00b75 applies. Models of this type\narise in the study of inverse harmonic oscillators interacting with a heat bath in the singular\ncoupling limit ([Wal]). Conditions on the pair (\u03bb, \u00b5) which ensure isometry\/unitarity of the\nresulting contraction cocycle are investigated in [FaW], from the point of view of the right\nequation dUt = (F\u2217 \u2297 IF)U\u0302t d\u000et .\nClassical birth and death processes have been constructed using quantum stochastic cal-\nculus ([Fa1, FaW]). These are similarly covered by the above theorem, this time working\nwith the Hilbert space l2(Z) and two dimensional quantum noise. These examples and others\nare treated in detail in [LW4].\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to Nick Weatherall for drawing our attention to\nDixmier\u2019s counterexamples.
