This article \naims to illuminate these issues by examining the \u2018political\u2019 and media tactics of one \nBritish social activist, known as \u2018the Umbrella Man\u2019, who works particularly on \ncampaigns for old age and disability issues. In a society where symbolic power is \nheavily concentrated in media institutions (cf Couldry, 2000a), the actions of those who \ntry to obtain media attention in spite of lacking the resources of media production, \nreveal a great deal about the normal constraints on being noticed and heard. These are \nexplored using various concepts from cultural studies, anthropology and political \nsociology, including transgression, exclusion, tactics and alternative celebrity. \n \nKeywords \nCultural exclusion; \u2018anti-political age\u2019; definitions of \u2018the political\u2019; symbolic conflict; \ntransgression; media tactics; activism by the elderly and disabled; public sphere. \n \n\u2018 . . . . a social analysis derived from Marxism must see as its task today the identification of moral \nconflicts connected to the social class structure which are hidden behind late capitalism\u2019s facade of \nintegration.\u2019   Axel Honneth, The Fragmented World of the Social (1995: 215) \n \n\u2018The inclination to dismiss \u201cindividual\u201d acts of resistance and to reserve the term \u201cresistance\u201d for \ncollective or organized action is misguided.\u2019 \n   James Scott, Weapons of the Weak (1995: 297) \n \nIntroduction \n2 \nIt has become a cliche of political debate in Britain and elsewhere in Europe to assert \nthat we live in an \u2018anti-political\u2019 age (Mulgan, 1995), or, more positively, that we have \nput \u2018class conflict\u2019 behind us, so as to face better the challenges of the globalized \neconomy.  \n \nSuch claims no doubt connect with strategies of political control, but they are also based \nin serious debates, about the terms on which any critical account of society or culture \ncan now be conducted. If political conflict has genuinely been reduced, then those who \nmount social critiques from the academy at least have to examine their conscience. But, \nas the political philosopher Axel Honneth has powerfully argued, the challenge can be \nreversed. What if, instead of consciousness of class-specific injustice declining, it is the \nmeans with which that consciousness can be expressed as such that have declined?  \n \nThere are many possible reasons for that shift. One is what Honneth calls \u2018cultural \nexclusion\u2019, by which he means \u2018those strategies which limit the articulation chances of \nclass-specific experiences of injustice by systematically withholding the appropriate and \nsymbolic means for their expression\u2019 (1995: 213). Perhaps Honneth\u2019s phrase \n\u2018systematically withholding\u2019 implies too much intentionality, but we can still ask: is the \nperception of reduced political conflict, even reduced political awareness, connected \nwith a change in the circumstances in which social and economic conflicts come to be \nperceived as political? Or, more modestly, is the apparent reduction in political conflict \nrelated to the conditions under which some social actors are seen as having political \nsignificance, and some are not? The issue, in other words, is where the boundary of \npolitics\u2019 \u2018discursive domain\u2019 (Stallybrass and White, 1986: 60)  gets drawn.  \n \nIf so, there is a serious question to be researched: how do people in practice contest the \nboundaries of \u2018the political\u2019? How is that connected to class position, education, gender, \n3 \nethnicity, and other factors? And since politics is now thoroughly mediated, how do \npeople  challenge the media processes which help reproduce particular definitions of \n\u2018the political\u2019? We should not look only at those institutions already defined as political, \nor assume these questions lie safely within the province of political sociology or \npolitical theory. They are questions of importance for cultural studies and media \nstudies, because they affect the whole field of cultural and social activity within which \n\u2018the political\u2019 is demarcated,1 and therefore the underlying conditions of today\u2019s \nmediated \u2018public sphere\u2019 (Habermas, 1989; Calhoun, 1992). \n \nIt is not only collective action that matters here. Given the massive authority to define \n\u2018the political\u2019 that is concentrated in media institutions, we would expect resistance to \nthat authority to be scattered, often disguised. We must look across to the other side of \npolitics, to a region that is not legitimated and lacks the implicit endorsement of \ncollective action. There we cannot dismiss individual actions as insignificant. One \nreason is that, as Honneth also argues (1995: 214),  it is partly through the \n\u2018individualisation\u2019 of social life that the contexts for  wider injustices to be expressed as \nsuch are limited, and political activity thereby constrained. We must look at individuals \nwho are precisely seeking collective significance for what they do, but lack the normal \nroutes to collective action. As James Scott in his classic study of everyday peasant \nresistance in Malaysia pointed out (the second quotation at the head of the article), it is \na mistake to dismiss individual, localized action as \u2018trivial\u2019 or non-political; it may be \nthe main, or only, tool of those who are furthest from the resources of legitimate \npolitical expression.  \n \nI want to explore these large issues through a very particular story: the social and media \nactivism of \u2018The Umbrella Man\u2019, so called because of the \u2018umbrella hats\u2019 he wears to \nprotests (see below). (I use this symbolic name, rather than his real name, at his \n4 \nrequest.) He is a working-class man in his 60s, living on the outskirts of London. He \nretired early through ill health from his job as a carpentry supervisor for a local \nauthority. In the past decade, he has participated in many campaigns, spanning the \nrange of activism in Britain, outside, that is, the official political process.  He has been \ninvolved in countless social conflicts: from purely local campaigns (on practical \nmeasures for the elderly and the disabled, such as mobility issues), to national \ncampaigns on specific social issues that continue earlier traditions of trade union and \npolitical activism (on hospital closures, pensioner rights, disability campaigns, and so \non), to those \u2018direct action\u2019 campaigns connected with the environment and animal \nrights that have attracted intense media coverage in Britain in recent years (the protests \nagainst live animal exports in 1995, the anti-road protests at Newbury and Fairmile in \n1996-7,  the Pure Genius land occupation in London in 1996, the campaign against the \nsecond runway at Manchester Airport in 1997, and so on).2  \n \nA common thread throughout the Umbrella Man\u2019s activism is his attempt to find ways \nof attracting media coverage for causes which are not normally in the media eye, and as \nsomeone who has no connections with media organizations. His practice is, he \ncontends, \u2018non-political\u2019; in the sense of being unconnected with formal political \norganizations, this is true. However, the issues on which he campaigns are increasingly \ncentral to the public standing of governments in Britain and many other \u2018developed\u2019 \ncountries - health provision, disability rights and benefits, pensions -  and his media \ntactics are an intervention in the politics of media power. His practice, therefore, \nillustrates well the dispersal of \u2018politics\u2019 in an \u2018anti-political\u2019 age. \n \nRoyal Watcher or Social Activist? \n \nAs a way into the issues which the Umbrella Man\u2019s activism raises, consider two \n5 \nnewspaper fragments. The first is an ironic report in a British broadsheet on reactions to \nthe Queen Mother\u2019s hip operation (Guardian, 27 January 1998, p. 3). Under the sub-\nheadline \u2018Biggest fan answers 5 am alarm call\u2019, it wrote: \n \n[the Royal surgeon] was assisted during the operation by two other members of \nthe Queen\u2019s Medical Household . . .  However [the Umbrella Man, \u2018UM\u2019] was \nassisted only by his wife. She woke the veteran royal-watcher at 5am to tell him \nabout the Queen Mother\u2019s stumble, and [he] packed his thermos at once. He \ntravelled from his official home - a bungalow in Waltham Abbey, Essex - to the \nQueen Mother\u2019s official home - Clarence House, The Mall, finally arriving \noutside the hospital at 8.30am. \u201cIt is terrible. It\u2019s like when you worry about your \nown parents\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are all rooting for her to make it to 100.\u201d \n \nThe patronising tone is obvious. The echoes of stories about the Prime Minister or other \ndignitary being \u2018awakened to news\u2019 of a major disaster at his\/her \u2018official home\u2019 and \nreaching the scene \u2018at such and such a time\u2019 (in the precisely measured time of public \ncrises) clash with the \u2018banalities\u2019 of suburbia (the \u2018thermos\u2019, the \u2018bungalow\u2019). It is \nimplied that the \u2018veteran royal watcher\u2019s\u2019 seriousness is out of place, and that he too is \nout of place on the national stage: an \u2018ordinary person\u2019 seeking vicarious importance \nfrom a parasocial relationship with a royal.   \n \nContrast this with how a local newspaper picked up part of the same story a few days \nlater (Essex Guardian and Gazette, 19 February 1998, p. 6): \n \nVeteran Waltham Abbey campaigner [UM] was in the thick of the action when \nhe wedged himself under a bus, protesting for disabled people\u2019s rights . . . [UM] \nwas part of the group DAN (Direct Action Network)  . . . Messages and chants \n6 \ntargeted Prime Minister Tony Blair . . . [UM] said: \u201cIt was a very productive day, \nit was busy and I believe we achieved a lot. I think it\u2019s worth doing, it does get \nnoticed.\u201d  \nDespite his busy day, [UM] found a moment to take a red rose to the Queen \nMother who was still recovering from her hip operation last week . . .  \n \nThis second, unpatronising, treatment puts the royalist gesture in a serious context \nunimaginable from the first article, a sustained  practice of protest against the current \nBritish government. \n \nI am interested in the paradoxes of a landscape of media representation that marks \nsome people in advance as politically insignificant: how do people resist being \npositioned in that way? How are public selves formed, and maintained, in the large, \npartly obscured space where people outside media institutions and public organisations \nattempt to influence current events? In this article, I will concentrate on one person\u2019s \npractice of resistance as its details reveal indirectly some of the constraints on being \nheard in the contemporary mediated public sphere. The larger argument - about the \nconcentration of symbolic power in media institutions and its impacts on social life - is \none I have developed at length elsewhere (Couldry, 2000a), and is beyond the scope of \nthis article. \n \nI first met the Umbrella Man in June 1996 at a meeting on a council housing estate in \nsouth London, near where an illegal occupation was taking place of a proposed \nsupermarket site owned by the international drinks conglomerate, Guinness Plc. This \nwas the occupation (May to October 1996) ironically called \u2018Pure Genius\u2019 after the \nGuinness advertising slogan.3  The meeting had been called as part of the public inquiry \ninto Guinness\u2019s redevelopment plans; a harassed planning inspector was in charge, \n7 \nlistening to local community views.  \n \nThe Umbrella Man was not a local resident, but was there to express his support for the \noccupation and for local residents opposing the development. He was dressed in shorts, \na white T-shirt covered with campaign badges, and a Union Jack hat.  I discovered that \nhe had visited the site several times, taking food and other supplies, and introducing it \nto old age pensioners from his area as part of a \u2018day out\u2019 in a local mobility bus. Later I \ninterviewed both the Umbrella Man and some of those passengers. I discovered that \nsupporting Pure Genius was just a small part of his (and their) activism.  \n \nI want to emphasise that my argument does not depend on claiming that the Umbrella \nMan\u2019s practice is representative of larger social trends in any simple sense, although, as \nI have already argued, we can learn a lot from individual stories.4  Some of what the \nUmbrella Man does is clearly exceptional; it is exceptional, precisely because it \nchallenges constraints on public action that are pervasive, but normally hidden. These \nconstraints can be traced in what the Umbrella Man does and how he talks about it. (For \nmore detailed explanation of this type of argument, see Couldry (2000a, ch. 1)).    \n \nThe Theoretical Landscape \n \nAlthough this is a quite specific story, behind it lie some broader debates, and absences, \nin cultural studies and sociology.  \n \nThe first is the terrain of symbolic action where early British cultural studies was  \nparticularly productive: the study of resistant practices of \u2018bricolage\u2019 and parody of elite \nor mass-distributed culture (Hebdige, 1979; Chambers, 1990). But we need to connect \nthis with more recent insights into symbolic production in European political sociology, \n8 \nespecially in the context of the \u2018new social movements\u2019 (Beck, 1992; Melucci, 1989, 1996; \nOffe, 1985). This work has brought out the pervasiveness of symbolic conflict as a \npolitical phenomenon, particularly (as Melucci argues) in mediated consumer cultures, \nsaturated with messages and images. In such a world, one central form of inequality is \nnot broadly economic or social, but rather unequal access to the \u2018power of naming\u2019 \n(Melucci, 1996: 225): that is, unequal access to the media resources to define, among \nother things, \u2018the political\u2019. The Umbrella Man\u2019s practice sits awkwardly at the \nboundary between \u2018cultural\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019 production, which it contests. As a result, I \nwill argue, he has to draw on a shared context of humour and popular patriotism to \nmake interventions, whose real message is much more provocative and political. That is \none reason for his activism\u2019s apparent eccentricity and conservatism.  \n \nA connection can also be made with historical work on the everyday resistance of \nsubordinate groups (Hobsbawm and Rude, 1972; Rude, 1980; Scott, 1985),  a tradition \nthat shares with Hebdige and Chambers\u2019 work a common origin in E. P. Thompson\u2019s \npioneering studies (1968, 1971 and 1978). Interestingly, Axel Honneth also refers to this \ntradition (1995: 315 n3) to support his argument that there is a great deal of contestation \nlying disguised behind the \u2018control mechanisms\u2019 that limit political expression. If the \ntools of symbolic action are unequally shared (through the \u2018de-symbolization\u2019 of most \npeople: ibid.: 213), then we have to look for \u2018politics\u2019 within the broader culture, where \nit may be \u2018forced below\u2019 into the realm of \u2018prepolitical privacy\u2019 (ibid.: 218). Honneth\u2019s \nessay was originally published in 1981, but it has even greater resonances now after two \ndecades in which trade unionism and working class politics have been largely \nmarginalized in Europe. This is the broader political context of the Umbrella Man\u2019s \napparently unpolitical actions.   \n \nThe Umbrella Man himself was a committed trade unionist, until ill health forced him \n9 \nto retire from work prematurely at 48 in the mid 1980s. His subsequent activism, \nhowever,  has coincided with the declining fortunes of trade union activism in Britain \nafter the cataclysm of the Miners\u2019 Strike in 1984-85. Since then, there has been a  \nresurgence of other forms of social activism (the anti-Poll Tax campaign of 1990, the \nanti-road protests, environmental and health-related campaigns), but these tend to be \ndiscussed in isolation from the decline of trade union activism. The Umbrella Man\u2019s \ncareer as an activist is interesting therefore because it connects the two periods of trade \nunion activism and decline; its background is precisely the fragmentation of formal \nworking-class solidarity predicted as early as the 1970s (Roberts et al., 1977).  \n \nWhen I interviewed the Umbrella Man in July 1996 and February 1997, experiences of \nsolidarity were something to which he often returned. He had been particularly \ninspired by a national miners\u2019 rally in the early 1990s, held in torrential rain in central \nLondon: \n \nThe unity was fantastic, people actually shared anything and everything . . . and \nthey were only too pleased to tell to each other where they came from, and they \ndid come from all over the country. \n \nThe experience of solidarity and sharing was something he saw on later protests \ncharacterised by physical hardship, such as the Pure Genius occupation and the anti-\nroads protests up trees and down tunnels at Newbury and Fairmile. When profiled in \nthe tabloid Sunday Express, he made a provocative connection between the solidarity of \nactivism and wartime (or, in his case, conscripted National Service in the early 1950s): \n \nI don\u2019t hold with criticising the young people who get involved in protest. \nStanding up for your beliefs is a damn sight harder than just going to work every \n10 \nday to look after Number One. Life is like the Army - it\u2019s comradeship and \ncaring about each other that really matter.  \n     (Sunday Express, 23 February, 1997, p. 23) \n \nI will come back to the significance of the Umbrella Man\u2019s military analogies later. His \ncomments about solidarity are interesting in other ways. Echoing Hannerz\u2019s point that \nthe contemporary experience of work normally generates individualism, not solidarity, \nhe told me that it was only when he retired that he felt ready to be active in wider \ncauses: \u2018where I was an ordinary person who went to work . . . I was actually working \nfor myself and my family . . . the difference is now, as I\u2019m retired, I\u2019ve decided to help \nothers.\u2019  And it was precisely such a sense of solidarity that, in the final year of Britain\u2019s \n18-year long  Conservative government, he saw threatened by the notorious Criminal \nJustice Act that restricted public gatherings in a draconian way: \u2018what this government \ndon\u2019t want is people [to] get together. They become a threat.\u2019 The night the Criminal \nJustice Act became law was in his view the night when \u2018our rights were taken away\u2019.  \n \nThe Umbrella Man\u2019s actions, then, are effectively political, even if he has no formal links \nwith institutional politics. His reference-points instead are broadly social. This connects \nwith Ulrich Beck\u2019s argument (1992: 194) that \u2018political modernization disempowers and \nunbinds [official] politics and politicizes society\u2019, except that it is, in a sense, still the \noverwhelming concentration of political power that the Umbrella Man is, in part, \ncontesting. The welfare state is probably the main focus of his decade of protest: \npensions, National Health Service cuts, other public services (such as support for \nstriking firemen), disability rights and disability benefits. Whether or not such \ncampaigns are presented formally as political, their consequences clearly are political: \nfor example, the march organized by the public service union Unison (which he \nattended) in North East England in April 1999, that contested the level set by the British \n11 \ngovernment for the Minimum Wage: the \u2018March for a Living Wage\u2019.  \n \nThere is to all this a spatial dimension. The importance of material and symbolic space \nto political contests, and also to the media\u2019s social impacts, have often been neglected (cf \nCouldry, 2000a).  An alternative approach would, perhaps, begin by drawing on Michel \nde Certeau\u2019s work (1984) on the \u2018strategies\u2019 and \u2018tactics\u2019 of cultural production, as well \nas Stallybrass and White\u2019s work (1986) on transgression and marginal spaces. There are \nparallels also with recent symbolic geography (Cresswell, 1996; Shields, 1991; Sibley, \n1995). In thinking about the space of public life, it is worth remembering David Sibley\u2019s \ncomment that \u2018the human landscape\u2019 (both literally and symbolically)  \u2018can be read as a \nlandscape of exclusion\u2019 (ibid.: ix). What, then, is the price of contesting the landscape of \nmedia and political exclusion? \n \nParticipating in public life through media interventions means taking quite specific \npaths across national territory. Richard Sennett (1977) has done more than anyone to \narticulate the subtle links between story-telling and space. What, Sennett has asked, are \nthe impacts  - on the types of stories we can tell to each other  - of the intensified \nregulation of public space, the reduction of so much public space to \u2018dead space\u2019 (1977: \n12)?5  And if, less polemically, our strategies for dealing with contemporary urban space \noften involve the masking of our differences (Lofland, 1973), what individual means are \navailable to use public space in order to project political messages that (like all politics) \nraise questions of difference?6  These issues are relevant to the Umbrella Man\u2019s actions \nat political and symbolic centres, such as Westminster, but also his tactics in the \ntelevision studio: particularly in the new public space of television talk shows on which \nhe regularly appears in the studio audience.  Symbolic politics and the politics of media \npower here intersect.   \n \n12 \nI will be working, finally, against two kinds of neglect within cultural studies and much \nsociology. First, there has been a general neglect of cultural production that falls outside \nthe cultural industries, or is not implicit in the consumption of cultural industry \nproducts. I mean the vast area of amateur enthusiasms and voluntary cooperation \nwhich Bishop and Hoggett (1986) have highlighted. While their work focused on \npleasure and relaxation, the point could be extended to voluntary work with political \nimplications.   \n \nThere is also the neglect within media and cultural studies of the elderly, or even those \nin late middle age, like the Umbrella Man (61 when I first met him).  Prejudice against \nthe old is of course a wider social phenomenon (Hazan, 1994), but age has been a \nparticular blind spot for cultural studies (cf Couldry, 2000b, Chapter Three). Yet even a \nsuperficial knowledge of social activism in 1990s Britain reveals that it is partly alliances \nacross the age range that characterised them: for example, the protests against the live \nexport of animals (Couldry, 2000a, chapter 7).  It is a myth that only the young are at the \n\u2018forefront\u2019 of social change or conflict,  and a pernicious one, that prevents us from \nseeing how in \u2018developed\u2019 nations many of the elderly too have been radicalised by \nharsh government treatment, a process directly related to class position (more \nspecifically, the ability to draw on a private pension). \n \nThere are, then, a number of debates that coincide in the figure of the Umbrella Man \nand the \u2018landscape of resistance\u2019 (Scott, 1985: 48)  he crosses.  \n \nSpecific Themes \n \nI have followed the Umbrella Man\u2019s public actions closely for more than three years \nacross many different campaigns. Since most of those campaigns have received little, if \n13 \nany, academic attention, there is a great deal of detail that could be discussed. I want to \nconcentrate, however, on four themes that illustrate the range of what he does, and the \nconstraints under which he operates: transgression, mobility, media tactics, and, finally, \nwhat I speculatively call an alternative geography of celebrity.  \n \nTransgression \nOne key to understanding the Umbrella Man\u2019s practice is to see the constraints under \nwhich he works. He is trying to transmit a message to those who would not ordinarily \nlisten to him. He is intervening, in other words, in  the politics of speech: who speaks \nand who is silent (and from where)? It in no way trivialises this point to connect it to the \nclothing the Umbrella Man wears for his public actions, for example the \u2018umbrella hats\u2019. \nThe umbrella hat idea originated in a joke hat bought at the seaside: a base supporting a \nsunshade, shaped like a small umbrella in the colours of the Union Jack flag. Each hat \nand the rest of his clothing worn on public events (T-shirts, placards) are covered in \nstickers and badges relating to particular campaigns in which he has participated in the \npast. In this way they are easily recognizable to camera crews and press photographers, \nand through them, perhaps, to a media audience.  \n \n[FIGURES 1 AND 2 NEAR HERE] \n \nThe function of these protest clothes is worth exploring in more detail. It applies even to \nsituations when the Umbrella Man is standing in the audience for royal events.  Among \nthe waiting crowd, he often still wears his umbrella hats with  their condensed \nreferences to protest activity, intending that people should read them. The late King \nHussein of Jordan once spoke to him on such an occasion: \u2018he wanted to know why I \nshould wear red white and blue with all the stickers and I explained to him that I \nhighlight the campaigns that I support people with and it shows that I\u2019m red white and \n14 \nblue, I\u2019m English\u2019. The point of his clothes becomes clearer: he is using the conventional \nbackcloth of \u2018red, white and blue\u2019 to project a message that would otherwise not be \nheard. He is trying to ensure that he (and the activist  message he carries) are seen and \nread by people of higher status. This is not vanity; it connects with an acute sense of the \nsocial and class differentials that determine who is and who is not normally seen and \nread:  \n \nIt\u2019s sad to say you don\u2019t always see the truth. Because, as I say, the camera \nalways moves into a different direction  . . .   they always talk  nice about the \nQueen and Royal Family and everything else . . . . I\u2019m not being rude, but what \nI\u2019m saying is, they always show the goody-goodies, the, em, upper crust but the \nordinary people . . . the only time you can gather is to wave your flag to the \nQueen and the King or whoever . . . (added emphasis) \n \nThe Umbrella Man through his clothing on royal occasions - its combination of \nconventional reference-points (nationalism, humour) and messages about specific \nprotests - attempts to influence where the eyes of the powerful (whether individuals or \ncameras) move. He described to me how he dresses for actual protest actions in similar \nterms:  \n \nIf I was dressed in clothes like this [i.e. normal casual clothes] and I was that keen \nto get my story over, nobody would ever listen to me. But if I stand out as an \nindividual that represents the campaign, I\u2019m not there just for myself, I\u2019m there \nfor the cause . . . \n \nThrough his clothes, then, the Umbrella Man makes himself into a readable sign of the \nevents to which he wants to draw attention. \n15 \n \nA similar strategy underlies the many other transgressions he makes. First of all, \nvarious actions which block the normal course of events and force attention onto the \nimage he wants to project: for example, handcuffing himself to buses, trains or \nbuildings. These actions are not just random gestures, but are linked directly to his \nconcerns with issues of mobility (see next section). So, for example, in October 1996 he \nchained himself to an London underground train at a  suburban station to draw \nattention to his claim that most disabled people are unable normally to board those \nsame trains.  \n \nA second type of transgression involves crossing a controlled physical boundary: \nentering government buildings without permission (the Treasury, the Home Office), \nputting a foot across the threshold of Ten Downing Street (\u2018just to say I\u2019ve been in\u2019), and \nso on. Although these actions can simply be read for their humour (playing with the \nboundaries of government institutions), they are usually intended to project a wider \npoint. His unofficial entry into the Treasury on Budget day 1996 received some media \ncoverage, as he intended: he was wearing Father Christmas uniform, adapted with \nflashing lights, campaign stickers and texts referring to the expected ill-treatment of \npensioners in the Budget! \n \nThese transgressions are striking because they work, in part, through signals of \nnormality. This applies not only to the Umbrella Man\u2019s clothes (whether the umbrella \nhat with its nationalist colours overwritten with campaign stickers and messages, or the \nFather Christmas uniform), but also to the account he gives of himself to the media. \nHere again is the passage from the short press profile in the tabloid Sunday Express (23 \nFebruary 1997, p. 42):  \n \n16 \nI don\u2019t jump on every bandwagon. I study each issue to work out my opinions \nand I\u2019m non-political. I don\u2019t hold with criticising the young people who get \ninvolved in protests. Standing up for your beliefs is a damn sight harder than just \ngoing to work everyday to look after Number One. Life is like the Army - it\u2019s \ncomradeship and caring about each other that really matter. \n \nA deliberately non-controversial framework - \u2018I\u2019m non-political\u2019 - is reinforced by a \nconsensual reference-point - army life - to make a far from uncontroversial point about \nprotest actions: the idea that protesting is more admirable and more courageous than \ngoing to work. The newspaper condensed these tensions into a sub-headline: \u2018The Old \nSoldier Who\u2019s Still Fighting\u2019.  \n \nIt would be a great mistake to see these consensual reference-points simply as evidence \nof the Umbrella Man\u2019s \u2018conservatism\u2019, without considering their tactical role in \ntransmitting a message, constructing a transgressive act out of non-controversial \nmaterial. His comment when I interviewed him captured the ambiguity: \u2018today, instead \nof getting medals, which I don\u2019t need, I get a [campaign] badge, and that\u2019s as good as a \nmedal.\u2019  \n \nThe Umbrella Man uses the reference-points of normality to make his transgressions \nreadable as something more than mere \u2018law-breaking\u2019. His own descriptions of his \npractice reflect this tension between normality and transgression directly in their \nlanguage.  Although he lacks any \u2018elaborated\u2019 language (Bernstein, 1971) to describe \nwhat he does, he expresses it effectively in other ways, particularly through adverbial \nphrases (\u2018in a different way\u2019, \u2018in a nice way\u2019) that reappropriate words whose normal \nimplications he wants to resist. For example, he talks of \u2018caus[ing] problems\u2019 or \n\u2018becom[ing] a criminal\u2019 \u2018in a different way\u2019. Or: \u2018I always try to break the law in a nice \n17 \nway\u2019. His language is also is, in a sense,  a form of transgression. \n  \nMobility \n \nIn the 1990s Britain saw increasing social activism by disabled groups, and this has \nrecently begun to receive national media attention with coverage, for example, of the \npainting of the gates of Downing Street in autumn 1997 to protest against disability \nbenefit cuts by the new Labour government. The Umbrella Man has been very active in \nthese campaigns and provides considerable practical assistance to disabled protesters, \nparticularly the Direct Access Network (DAN). There have been many protests across \nBritain, not only on issues of benefit cuts and service cuts (such as the closure of the \nCentre for Independent Living in Lambeth, south London, in 1999), but also broader \nissues of disabled access and mobility. In April 1999 he travelled to Washington with \nmembers of DAN to join up with American disabled protesters. I mentioned earlier the \nUmbrella Man\u2019s chaining himself to a London underground train.  \n  \nIssues of mobility have been central to the Umbrella Man\u2019s activism from the beginning. \nShortly after he was forced to retire, when his own mobility was still limited, he became \nconcerned with the numbers of elderly and disabled people in his town who were \nunable to leave their homes, because of lack of transport services. He organised a local \nmobility bus to give them days out. He has also mounted a large number of local \ncampaigns to preserve bus and other transport services.  \n \nHis links with DAN developed in the mid 1990s and are closely related to his views \n(already discussed) on the importance of building solidarity, as he explained to me:  \n \nI also get involved with disabled people. Disabled people . . . travel around [to \n18 \nprotests] because, why?, they have to support their groups. The whole idea of \ndisabled people moving around in wheelchairs [to protests] [is] to highlight their \nproblems in different areas . . .  \n \nBecause disabled people\u2019s own mobility is restricted, it is all the more important \n(practically and symbolically) for them to coordinate protest actions between otherwise \nisolated groups around the country. These links are a major part of what the Umbrella \nMan does: he drives activists to sites they would not otherwise reach. This connects \nwith Richard Sennett\u2019s idea that the way we move around public  space affects what \nstories we are able to tell about ourselves. The story of a mobile protest is particularly \npowerful if told from the position of the disabled person. Equally, the story of elderly \npeople\u2019s \u2018day out\u2019 at a protest action (whether for their own cause, or for others, such as \nthe Pure Genius occupation) is significant if told from the perspective of the elderly, \nsince it contradicts the usual assumption that elderly people are not involved in protests \nof any sort. \n \nThrough practical action, whether or not with media coverage, the Umbrella Man \nchallenges the normal geography of protest; he connects areas of social life and activism \nthat would otherwise remain separate, not perceived as part of a wider pattern. \nStrikingly, he sees his umbrella hat as materialising precisely this sort of connection. \nThe umbrella hats are covered with badges and stickers, bringing together in one place \nreferences to the many campaigns across Britain in which he is involved, and informing \nwhoever meets him of those campaigns. Given the lack of media information \nconnecting most of those campaigns, this is far from trivial. As the Umbrella Man put it: \n \nI\u2019ve got probably hundreds of badges, different campaigns . . . And there\u2019s loads \nof stickers , stickers on stickers. And  . . . it highlights what is what  . . . And I \n19 \nthink in terms, that if I\u2019m supporting the pensioners and I\u2019m supporting the \ndisabled people and I\u2019m supporting the homeless, it all comes together doesn\u2019t \nit? . . . And what makes it come together is this [pointing to the hat]. (added \nemphasis) \n \nTo call this a \u2018geographic\u2019 practice is not an academic inflation, since it is implicit in the \nUmbrella Man\u2019s own language: \u2018the whole idea is to bring the groups together\u2019 , \u2018I have \ngot to move around\u2019, \u2018I travel where I am needed\u2019 . Not only does he have a strong \nsense of the importance of solidarity, he negotiates the conditions under which (in a \nhighly dispersed and fragmented society) such solidarity can now be achieved.  \n \n[FIGURE 3 NEAR HERE] \n \nAt the same time, the Umbrella Man spends a lot of time at the key ritual centres of \nBritish political life: not only outside Buckingham Palace, but more importantly outside \nthe Houses of Parliament and around the government departments of Whitehall. As he \nput it in one letter copied to me, \u2018I spend lots of time at the House of Commons to \nensure we\u2019re not forgotten\u2019. It is all part of being \u2018in the right place at the right time\u2019 \n(interview with author). Mobility, then, involves not only making new connections \nacross space, but travelling to the fixed ritual centres of Britain\u2019s political life, which, of \ncourse, are also central sites of media activity, my next theme. \n \nMedia Tactics \n \nI want now to consider the Umbrella Man\u2019s media tactics more specifically. The link \nbetween mobility and media tactics is direct, because it is by travelling  to the ritual \npolitical centres and to demonstrations across the country, that the Umbrella Man has \n20 \nthe chance to project his message to a media audience: remember that he has no \nresources of media production himself. As he wrote in another letter: \u2018always look out \non TV, you never know where I\u2019m going to turn up\u2019. \n \nIf we are interested in the contemporary relationship between media and politics, it is \nvital to consider the many types of media tactics: only in this way can we get beyond \nthe small percentage of \u2018politics\u2019 in the media eye, seeing the much wider landscape of \nactivism that is aimed at media coverage, but does not achieve it. Not receiving \n(deserved?) media coverage is a major issue for less fashionable campaigns, such as \npensioner and disability rights. A comment from one of the many pensioner campaign \nmagazines about a protest in Whitehall on the day the Blair government announced its \npension reform package in early 1998 captures this tension: \n \n . . . with all this magnificent show of pensioner power and despite the TV \ncameras and journalists present - not a word in the media except for one \ncaptioned photograph in the next day\u2019s Times, and some very brief glimpses of a \nsmall section of the lobby queue on the main television news channels. \n    Essex Pensioner  Summer 1998, issue 8, p. 5 \n \nIn spite of their appearance of playfulness, humour and (English!) eccentricity, it \nbecame clear to me from studying the Umbrella Man\u2019s actions, that they are a well \ndeveloped form of media \u2018tactics\u2019 (in de Certeau\u2019s (1984) sense),  designed precisely to \ncombat the difficulties of an \u2018ordinary person\u2019 obtaining media coverage.7  The \nUmbrella Man\u2019s principal media tactic is to insert himself within the frame of larger \nevents or spaces which are already likely to receive media interest, in order to become \nreadable by the media.  He achieves this, first, by performing actions that are \n\u2018outrageous\u2019 and, second, as we have already seen, by wearing particular clothes. It \n21 \nhelps, however, if he can do all this within the context of some larger story that is \nalready guaranteed media attention. \n \nThat is why many of his actions take place near Parliament, especially on major media \ndays such as Budget Day. Those spaces provide a narrative context within which his \nactions may get \u2018picked up\u2019 (his own phrase). Here he describes his entry into the \nTreasury Department on Budget Day 1996 wearing Father Christmas uniform: \n \nI made a beeline for the Treasury Department. And what was good about it was, \nhe [the Chancellor of the Exchequer] didn\u2019t turn up, so we went in after him . . . \nAnd it must have been , whether it was luck or whatever, but the TV cameras \ncame running down to Treasury Department and by the time I\u2019d got inside the \ndoor, as normal security came after me and politely pushed me out the door, \nyeh? And what was good about it was, when the cameras were there in front of \nthem, they ran back in because they don\u2019t like to be seen  on the door with Father \nChristmas  . . . I\u2019ve got my sack, my hat and all those boards . . . and this went all \nover the world.    \n \nThe conventional Father Christmas uniform (a source of automatic, uncontroversial \nhumour) made him ready material for the television cameras already present to cover \nthe Budget announcement. Once again, his aim was to ensure he was read not as an \nindividual but as the representative of a cause. As he put it elsewhere in the interview, \n\u2018we attract the camera for the others\u2019. If he stood there as an individual, he implies, he \nwould be ignored - just another \u2018ordinary\u2019 bystander to important national events. His \nactions are therefore a reaction to necessity. This suggests a wider, but little studied, \ntopic: how are people outside institutional politics now using media tactics as an \ninstrument of symbolic conflict in Alberto Melucci\u2019s sense, the tactics of the amateur \n22 \nphoto-opportunity.8   \n \nThese actions are not just \u2018antics\u2019. The Umbrella Man is well aware of media \nstereotyping, and resists it, using the resources at hand (including his status as an ex-\nsoldier, already mentioned): \n \nI\u2019m one of the old soldiers who\u2019s got a clean nose . . . but I support the elderly \nand the young people. But I do believe  . . .  me being there helps them. Because \nthey can\u2019t call me a thug or a bully or out of work  . . .  because they tend to paint \npeople with a brush and then they push them aside. Well they can\u2019t do that to \nme.   \n \nFor the same reason (his awareness of stereotyping), he is equally ready to adapt his \nnormal practice, when the conditions of media coverage alter: for example, when he \nappears as an individual \u2018ordinary person\u2019 on a television talk show or discussion \nprogramme (such as as Kilroy, Question Time). He is well aware that in this setting, \nbecause of those programme\u2019s exclusive interest in individualising general issues - yet \nmarginalizing the eccentric - it is crucial to appear \u2018normal\u2019 in order to get points across: \n\u2018being part of the audience, I always dress pretty smart so I look normal\u2019. But his aim, as \nelsewhere, is to contribute to a campaign and get beyond an individual persona: \n \nif you\u2019re fighting a cause, you should be allowed to have a few words to say \nwhat you\u2019re fighting for. And I mean, to talk about yourself on the telly is not \nworth being there really, it\u2019s what you\u2019re standing for . . . you\u2019re speaking for the \npeople, the real people really.   \n \nAn Alternative Geography of Celebrity \n23 \n \nJust as the Umbrella Man\u2019s transgressions have to work within the geography of our \ndispersed social world (its ritual centres, its potential connections), so his media tactics \nsuggest an alternative geography of the media. The media (Couldry, 2000a), involve not \nonly the transmission of messages across space, but a geographical concentration of \nsymbolic production in certain places, rather than others. Celebrity is directly related to \nthis spatial concentration of media activity.9  An alternative geography of celebrity \nmight develop in two ways:  first, by attempting to draw the cameras to different types \nof place and person; or second, by appearing in spaces where the cameras are already \npresent, in order to project an alternative type of person within existing media \nnarratives. \n \nSome of the Umbrella Man\u2019s  protest actions take the first approach: for example, \nchaining himself to a tube train at a suburban station did obtain a small amount of \ntelevision coverage (on local news reports) for an issue (disabilty access) that is rarely \nrepresented in the media. He has also been involved (although only through providing \npractical and moral support) in protest actions by others which drew large numbers of \ncameras away from the normal political \u2018centres\u2019, for example the anti-roads protest \nencampments at Newbury. Another example would be the Umbrella Man\u2019s \nparticipation in 1996 in digging up the palatial garden of the then Deputy Prime \nMinister Michael Heseltine for a campaign against open-cast mining. As one woman I \ninterviewed in another context commented on national press coverage of this incident \n(Daily Mail 22 October 1996, p. 13):   \u2018it\u2019s funny when you pick up national newspapers \nand see people you know in there digging holes in people\u2019s gardens\u2019. The potential \nimpact of such media appearances can only be appreciated against their normal \nbackground: the fact that when most people watch or read the news, it never involves \nanyone they know, or are likely to know! The news is \u2018another world\u2019 (cf Edelman, \n24 \n1988: 35). The Umbrella Man is well aware of this - his experience  through most of his \nlife has been no different - which gives a meaning to his  media appearances that is not \nmere exhibitionism:  \n \n . . . I\u2019m making the most of what I can do. And I think it actually gets home, they \nsay, \u2018Oh, saw  you on the telly\u2019. It\u2019s not me they saw, they saw what I represent \nand it gives them hope.  \n \n Much of the time, however, the Umbrella Man challenges celebrity in the second \nway mentioned above: he uses existing media narratives as a framework in which he \ncan insert himself, in order to project his causes. I have already discussed his actions at \nthe centres of political action (such as Westminster). The same applies to his following \nof media celebrities, such as television personalities and sportspeople. It is clear both \nthat he is fascinated by celebrity and that he sees a tactical advantage in associating \nhimself with it. He claims to be increasingly known to celebrities and politicians, and \nwhen a significant meeting occurs, sometimes passes on this information to the local \npress as a way of maintaining his profile as a campaigner. Hence, local newspaper \nreports of his trips outside Buckingham Palace to see the Queen Mother, his various \nmeetings with television personalities on protests, or the occasion when a Japanese \ntelevision crew covered his protest outside Parliament on Budget Day, 1998 and then \ndid a wider report on his activism.  \n \nIt is easy of course to dismiss such small stories; for some, they will seem like the small \nchange of provincial news, where news demand outstrips supply. I am not for a \nmoment using them as evidence of the wider \u2018effects\u2019 of the Umbrella Man\u2019s tactics, \nalthough it is worth remembering that the Umbrella Man has received a profile in the \nnational press (see above). They are evidence rather of a different process: the continual \n25 \nsmall-scale battles along the borderlines of celebrity and media power. Each local report \ncrucially referred to the Umbrella Man as a campaigner for pensioners rights; the \n\u2018celebrity\u2019 storyline therefore kept alive another story about activism, against the grain \nof normal media storylines. But, as with the whole of the Umbrella Man\u2019s practice, his \ncauses are precariously poised between a temporary promise of speaking and a long-\nterm condition of silence: \n \nSomewhere along the line I do get the papers [in which he has been featured] \nposted to me . . . It\u2019s the feedback . . . I think it\u2019s important to know the feedback \non the result that you got. And . . . you can show other people what the outcome \nis, otherwise it\u2019s just word to mouth and you don\u2019t know really.  \n        \n In a world where, for most people, media attention - being publicly listened to - \nis extremely scarce, tactical challenges to that inequality are inevitably local; they work \nalong the border zones of media geography, playing with its boundaries and  rituals of \nexclusion. de Certeau in his reflections on tactical play put it well: the tactician must \n\u2018insinuate[] [him]self into the other\u2019s place . . . without being able to keep it at a \ndistance\u2019 (1984: xix).  These tactics of the media world are all too easily obscured or \nignored. As Dick Hebdige famously put it, it is a matter of discovering those who are \n\u2018hiding in the light\u2019 (1988): hidden from us by the glare of media productions, caught up \nwithin the supposedly central narratives of our age.    \n \nConclusion \n \nBefore we can understand the politics of an anti-political age, we have to understand \nthe wider forces that shape who and what gets defined as \u2018political\u2019. We have to grasp \nthe mechanisms through which many people are excluded from existing political \n26 \ncultures and their mediated forms. Cultural studies is well placed to open up these \nissues, particularly if it connects with recent European work in political sociology and \nsymbolic geography. This is what I have tried to do in drawing out the implications of \nthe Umbrella Man\u2019s highly individual \u2018political\u2019 practice. \n \nThe Umbrella Man has had many successes. It is perhaps no accident that, following his \nmany local campaigns, on health, transport and other issues, the local authority in his \nhome town has begun to describe itself as \u2018a campaigning council\u2019 (Essex Guardian and \nGazette, 23 July 1998, p. 7). The Umbrella Man has also been involved in effective \nnational campaigns, particularly on issues of disability, where for example the protests \noutside Downing Street\u2019s gates and the entrance to the Houses of Parliament have \nhelped put disability benefit cuts onto the national front pages.  \n \nMy argument, however, does not depend on such a balance-sheet of success and failure; \nit is not a question of \u2018effects\u2019. The point has been to illustrate - here from one case only, \nbut potentially from many more - how the immense concentration of symbolic power in \ncontemporary societies shapes the actions of those outside the \u2018centres\u2019, whether of \nmedia power or political power or both. The story has not simply been one of \nreproducing inequality, but one of contestation and  humour, a continuing struggle on \nunequal terms.   \n \nI raised at the beginning questions about how people\u2019s position in such struggles are \naffected by broad social variables: class, education, gender and so on. Clearly, to \ndevelop systematically such large-scale connections would require a much larger \nprogramme of empirical work, and this is a project for the future. It would be \ninteresting also to discuss at greater length the extent to which in the mediated public \nsphere individual actions can sometimes make connections on a larger scale than would \n27 \nbe possible without mediation: the balance-sheet of media power is complex (cf \nCorrner, 1995), and I have tended to focus on its hidden negatives, rather than its \npotential positives. The Umbrella Man\u2019s case remains, however, suggestive of what a \nclose attention to individuals\u2019 media tactics can achieve. \n \nDuring his struggle, the Umbrella Man\u2019s relationship to the media has changed. Before, \nhe told me, he read the paper only occasionally and watched little television: he was in \na sense alienated from the media. Now, he says, he is too busy to read or watch much, \nunless he, or his causes, are covered. His media consumption in quantitative terms may \nnot have increased, but he has become a different type of media non-consumer, \nsomeone active within, or at least on the borders of, media production.  \n \nHe has made, then, a journey across the uneven landscape on which politics and media \nnarratives are constructed. Such journeys are normally obscured behind the constructed \nfacade of \u2018the events of the day\u2019. They give us an insight into the processes of inclusion \nand exclusion that underlie our present politics, and its absences.  \n28 \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis article is a more developed version of material discussed briefly in Couldry (2000a, \nChapter Seven). Many thanks to David Morley for his encouragement and helpful \ncriticisms in conducting all the research on which this article is based,  and to Bill \nSchwarz and the journal\u2019s anonymous readers for valuable criticisms of an earlier \nversion. Very many thanks to the Umbrella Man himself for originally giving time to be \ninterviewed, and since then for his unceasing help with documentation and information \non his many campaigns, and above all for the inspiration which through his activism he \nhas given to me and to many others.  \n \nEndnotes \n \n1 Here I am reviving a line of argument from earlier cultural studies: notably Hall \n(1977) and Stallybrass and White (1986). \n \n2 For more general background, see Couldry (2000a: Part Three, Introduction) and \nMcKay (1996). \n \n3 For more analysis of that event, see Couldry (2000a: ch. 8) and Featherstone (1996). \n \n4 See more generally Steedman (1986), Bourdieu (1993) and for discussion Couldry \n(2000b, ch. 3). \n \n5 This process is of course gendered (Valentine, 1989), although I will not focus on \ngender issues here. \n \n29 \n6  A similar issue arises also in relation to public art (cf Couldry, 1995; Hebdige, 1993). \nPublic art, however, is almost always recognised as an exclusive discourse with special \n(even if limited) rights; the public artist has an institutional licence which someone \ntrying to make an individual stand in public space on a social issue rarely has.  \n \n7  On the construction of \u2018the ordinary person\u2019 versus the \u2018media person\u2019, see Couldry \n(2000a, ch. 3). \n \n8  One example would be actions aimed at the cameras by \u2018ordinary\u2019 shareholders \noutside general meetings of large corporations, a topic I intend to write about about \nelsewhere. \n \n9  Cf Couldry (1999) on \u2018the geography of celebrity\u2019 in the events following the death of \nPrincess Diana. \n \n30 \nREFERENCES \n \nBeck, Ulrich (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity.
