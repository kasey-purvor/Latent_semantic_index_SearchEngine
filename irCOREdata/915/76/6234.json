ISBN: 0-7494- 20596. 181 pages,\npaperback. \u00a318.99.\nFor a variety of different reasons, increasing use\nis now being made of the Internet for the\ndelivery of course materials and\/or for the\nsupport of teaching and learning activities. The\ndetails of the mechanisms used will obviously\nvary from one situation to another, depending\nupon the types of problem to be addressed.\nThese may involve mentoring, teaching,\nmonitoring, recording, tutoring, assessing, and\nso on. In this book, the author attempts to\nreview the educational and administrative\nconsiderations of offering courses, course\nmaterials or course delivery via the Internet.\nThe book is organised into eight chapters, an\nA-Z of the Internet (intended for novices) and a\nbrief conclusion. A very short bibliography and\na subject index are also included.\nIn the opening chapter the author describes the\nnature of the Netscape Navigator browser\nsoftware and the visual appearance of HTML\ndocuments when viewed using this interactive\ntool. The second chapter discusses and debates\nthe reasons why teachers would want to use the\nInternet for teaching and learning materials.\nSome of the important topics discussed in this\nchapter include interaction and the changing\nroles of teachers and learners - a movement\naway from teacher-centred delivery towards\nstudent-centred access. Chapter 3 explores some\nof the general considerations that need to be\ntaken into account once a decision has been\nmade to use the Internet as a support aid or as a\ndelivery vehicle. The two major issues discussed\nrelate to 'course character' (with respect to the\namount of theory and practical work that a\ncourse contains) and the factors that influence\nthe selection of appropriate course content (in\nrelation to both new courses and the revision of\nexisting ones). The main topic addressed in the\nfourth chapter is the relationship that exists\nbetween the Internet and instructional design.\nHere, the author draws a parallel with the widely\nused technique of computer-based learning\n(CBL), and suggests that much of the experience\nthat exists in this field should be applicable to the\nInternet situation. Of course, while this is true,\nthe Internet is capable of offering much more\nthan a stand-alone computer running a CBL\npackage. One of the attractive features of both\nInternet and intranet systems is the mechanisms\nthey offer for handling interactive forms.\nFacilities such as this are briefly discussed in\nchapter 5, while chapter 6 gets down to a\nconsideration of some of the more specific details\nthat need to be taken into account when\nestablishing and maintaining a Web site. Some\nof the important topics discussed include\nstructure and content, help facilities, navigation\nissues, screen design and security.\nThe main focus of Chapter 7 is on cost\nconsiderations and the economic benefits to be\naccrued from using the Internet for course\ndelivery. Three basic 'schedules' are considered.\nThese deal with course development costs,\naccess costs, and revenue generation based on\nincreased student access to resources. In the\nfinal chapter, the author describes some of the\ndeveloping areas of the Internet, including the\nuse of audio and video, video-conferencing,\ninteractivity, virtual reality, access and equity,\ngenre, teacher\/learner roles and attitudes,\nsearching for information, and the use of\nInternet services such as email, bulletin boards\nand chat facilities.\nDealing only with concepts, problems and issues,\nthis is not a book that is likely to have great\nappeal for technically minded readers. It gives a\nvery superficial, non-technical treatment of the\nInternet. Thus it would not be of much use to\nanyone who might want actually to get involved\nin setting up materials for Web access as it gives\nno guidance as to how the concepts it describes\nmight be realised - for this, a more practical\nbook on Internet techniques would be needed.\nThe reference section reflects another short-\ncoming in that many of the 'educational'\nreferences are quite dated, and there are no refer-\nences whatsoever to Internet-related material.\n.Although this book does contain some useful\nideas, bearing in mind the above criticisms, and\ntaking into account the number of grammatical,\nstylistic and technical errors it contains, it is not\na text I would strongly recommend.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nFlexible Learning in Higher Education edited by\nWinnie Wade, Keith Hodgkinson, Alison Smith\nand John Arfleld, London: Kogan Page, 1994.\nISBN: 0-7494-1418-9. 154 pages, paperback.\n\u00a316.95.\nDevelopments undertaken under the auspices of\nthe Flexible Learning Initiative (a project\n75\nRevievw\nfunded under the former Universities Funding\nCouncil's Flexibility in Course Provision\nprogramme) have led to the accumulation of\nconsiderable expertise in flexible learning at\nLoughborough University. This book is the\nresult of that institution's efforts to introduce\nflexible and more effective learning practices\ninto its teaching programmes.\nThe book is aimed at educators and staff\ndevelopers in higher education and is divided\ninto three sections: broad issues, case studies,\nand the student view of flexible learning.\nThe first section covers six aspects. Student\ndiversity is addressed in the opening chapter and\ndeals with the need to provide flexible means of\naccess and course design for both 'traditional'\nand non-standard students including mature,\npart-time, disabled and international students.\nFlexibility in course structures is addressed in\nChapter 2 in relation to the increased flexibility\noffered by modularization, semesterization and\ncredit accumulation. Some of the problems\nassociated with such structures are considered.\nPhil Wild, in Chapter 3, focuses on the power of\nIT to facilitate the flow of information and to\nenhance learning, but suggests that development\ntime and associated costs will continue to inhibit\nextensive use within the curriculum. The need for\nsupport for off-site learners is considered in\nChapter 4, and in particular deals with the need\nto understand the 'situation' of the flexible\nlearner and how it can affect the learning\nprocess. Writing course guides for flexible\nlearning is treated in Chapter 5, and the need for\nan adaptive library resource and library service\nbrings this section to a close.\nThe case studies are from both arts and science\nsectors and include examples from Geography,\nDesign and Technology, Mathematics, Educa-\ntion, Business, Design Engineering and English\ncourses. In several of the case studies (e.g.\nGeography and Mathematics) the need for\nchange from traditional teaching methods is\nrelated (at least in part) to increases in student\nnumbers and worsening staff student ratios.\nDifferent methods for teaching large classes\neffectively are described. In the Mathematics\ncase study, traditional lectures were largely\nreplaced by a course textbook and study guide\nwith support to students being provided in\ntutorials. Compulsory class tests prompted\nstudents to follow the programme of study, but\nthe initial findings about the efficiency of the\nteaching methods are not entirely convincing.\nTwo case studies (IT for student teachers and\nthe Business School post experience\nmanagement education) highlight the problems\nof teaching students in the workplace. In\nteaching primary school teachers, the emphasis\nhas been on the development of a flexible\nlearning plan which involves the student in\nmore critical self-directed work. The Business\nSchool case study explores more general issues\nassociated with remote study such as off-\ncampus support, isolation of the students from\neach other and from their lecturers, and the\nvariability of workplace pressures. The case\nstudy in design and technology makes a useful\ndistinction between flexible and distance\nlearning materials, indicating that the intention\nin this instance was to produce flexible\nmaterials which require the student to use\nfacilities only available within the providing\ndepartment. In addition, tutorial support was\navailable only at timetabled tutorial times,\nalthough the actual learning materials were\navailable throughout the working day. The\nmaterials were in this instance produced using\nsponsorship from a commercial organization.\nThe problem of production of appropriate\nlearning materials is also addressed in the case\nstudy on the MSc in Engineering Design. Here,\nmaterials were produced with assistance from\noff-campus consultants.\nThe final section of the book explores student\nopinion of flexible-learning techniques. Student\nacceptance of new study techniques, student\nmotivation and skill development are discussed.\nAlthough published in 1994, this book still\nprovides valuable information and advice on\ndesigning, structuring and writing flexible\nlearning programmes in Higher Education. It\nshould be noted, however, that the use of\ntechnology for communication with students\nand for the dissemination or presentation of\nlearning materials is not addressed in any of the\ncase studies, although this is probably a\nreflection of the book's age rather than an\nintentional omission.\nKathy Buckner, Queen Margaret College,\nEdinburgh\nEverything You Ever Needed To Know About\nTraining - A Complete Step-by-step Guide to\nTraining and Development by K. Thome and D.\nMackey, London: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN:\n0-7494-2084-7.216 pages, paperback. \u00a318.99.\nAs universities develop well formed strategies\n76\nVolume 5 Number 2\nfor research, teaching and information, it\nbecomes increasingly important to have a well-\ntrained workforce to implement these strategies.\nIn Higher Education, the staff-training function\nmay be carried out, inter alia, by the Staff\nDevelopment Office, by individual academic\ndepartments, by the Computing Service or by\nexternal trainers. Yet however training is\ndelivered, it has a set of processes in common.\nIt is these that this book aims to tackle. The\nauthors' objectives are to 'create a compendium\nof concepts, ideas and resources to help those\nwho help others to learn', and in so doing they\nset out to disseminate good practice and\nsynthesize a trainer's, inherent knowledge and\nskills. The book is oriented towards the\nbusiness sector, but this should not deter the\neducationalist. It is designed as a 'dip in' guide\nand is particularly effective in the provision of\nquick reference checklists. For example, using\neither the clearly set-out contents page or the\nindex, one can quickly locate guidelines\ndesigned to help the trainer handle difficult\npeople. Even the experienced trainer will find\nsome key points which s\/he may not otherwise\nhave considered.\nThe book aims to be comprehensive, its nine\nchapters covering Being Professional, How\nPeople Learn, Designing a Training\nProgramme, Delivering Training, Sources of\nInspiration, Evaluation of Training, The\nTrainer as..., Training as a Career, and Training\nas a Business. Each of these, of course, could be\nexpanded to fill a whole volume, but what the\nbook lacks in depth it makes up for in breadth,\nand indeed deals with almost all aspects of\ntraining. Each chapter is subdivided so that\nparticular subsections can be easily found.\nThere are also three appendices, forms and\nmodels for training, useful contact names and\naddresses, and a recommended reading list.\nThe idea of the trainer as an agent of change\nruns through the book. Being able to identify\ntraining needs within the context of a business\nin a consultative role is seen as crucial. The\nauthors promote self-evaluation and assessment\non the part of the trainer.\nThe book begins with the premise that to\ndeliver effective training you need to be\ncomfortable with yourself. Although some\nreaders may find aspects of this first chapter a\nlittle too self-evident (for example, see the\nchecklist on preventing burnout), others may\nbenefit from the down-to-earth, practical\nadvice. The authors constantly tread a fine line\nbetween stating the obvious and providing\ncomprehensive information for the new trainer.\nChapter 2 is concerned with how people learn,\nin particular recognizing the importance of\ndesigning courses for a range of preferred\nlearning styles. Too often courses will appeal to\na certain type of learner who shares the same\nlearning style as the trainer. However, this\nimportant subject is not covered in sufficient\ndepth.\nChapter 3 describes methods for designing a\ntraining programme. Following a short section\non developing the initial idea, there is a very\nuseful overview on designing a learning\nsolution. The importance of having SMART\n(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic,\nTimed) objectives is emphasized. The section on\nthe production of materials is brief, but as the\nauthors point out, 'the breadth and scope of the\nvarious methods merit a book in their own\nright'. Chapter 4 details ways of delivering\ntraining. This chapter again veers between the\nobvious (be careful what you eat and drink the\nnight before a course), and the need to outline\nall the steps to successful delivery for the less\nexperienced trainer. It again includes useful\nchecklists to which even experienced trainers\nmight wish to refer, foe example one on using\nexternal speakers. Appendix 2 expands on the\nmaterial in this chapter by providing a model\nfor evaluating other trainers' delivery. The\nsection on dealing with the unexpected is useful\npre-course reading for any trainer.\nChapter 5 outlines ways in which the trainer\ncan find sources of inspiration for developing\ntraining programmes7\"It includes methods of\ngenerating ideas and guidelines for creative\nproblem-solving. However, techniques such as\nmind mapping are not covered in enough detail,\nand no examples are given on how to create a\nmind map. Chapter 6 on evaluation of training\nis well presented and thorough within the scope\nof the book. It emphasizes the importance of\ndetailed evaluation of the training and\ndevelopment function in addition to assessment\nof individual training programmes or events.\nThe chapter contains useful checklists on what\nand how to evaluate, with examples of\nevaluation forms in the appendices. Chapter 7\nconsiders the evolving role of trainers and the\nmany different situations in which they may\nfind themselves, ranging from coach, mentor or\nfacilitator to assessor, author and conference\norganizer. Each section is clearly outlined with\n77\nReviews\nchecklists and points to consider if you wish to\nbe successful in any or all of these roles.-Here,\nas elsewhere, a question and answer technique\nis used to good effect to respond to frequently\nasked questions. Chapter 8 deals with training\nas a career, and tackles the important issues of\ncareer progression and personal development.\nChapter 9 discusses training as a business. The\nstep-by-step approach covering aspects such as\nassessing the marketplace is very valuable,\nparticularly for those who may have little idea\nas to how to set up a business.\nFor new trainers this book provides an\noverview and general introduction to the world\nof training. More experienced trainers will\nprobably value the checklists and reference\npoints. No one book can provide 'everything\nyou ever needed to know about training', but\nthis is a useful broad-brush overview. It is\nunusual in that it does not merely describe the\nprocesses of training but includes information\non training as a career and as a business. It is\nwell presented, and in the manner of good\ntraining it is simple to follow and does not\nbaffle the reader with jargon or unnecessary\ndetail. Any book which forces readers to\nrethink and question their approach to their job\nis a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf.\nDebra Fayter, University of York\nMultimedia Marketing for Design Firms by\nCurtis B. Charles and Karen M. Brown, New\nYork: John Wiley, 1996. ISBN: 0-471-14609-9,\n222 pages, paperback (includes CD-ROM for\nWindows\/Macintosh). \u00a334.95.\nEffective marketing is essential for almost any\nbusiness. The ability to inform customers about\nproducts and services in a compelling manner is\ncritical to winning sales and maintaining a\nprofitable customer base. Today, advances in\nmultimedia personal computing are offering\nnew possibilities for marketing, and this book is\naimed at firms engaged in the business of\narchitecture and design who might wish to take\nadvantage of the new developments. It\ndemonstrates how such companies can\nsuccessfully market their ideas and win clients\nby exploiting the capabilities of multimedia\ndesktop computers.\nThe book is composed of seven chapters of\nvarying length. They evolve from an exposition\nof desktop-publishing (DTP) technology,\nthrough digital video, to multimedia presenta-\ntion management. There is no bibliography, but\nthere is a subject index and a CD (Windows or\nMacintosh) supports the text. It contains\nsoftware, a presentation of rendering samples,\nand some animation.\nChapter 1 provides a simple but comprehensive\nintroduction to DTP. It is argued that the\nprocess of design traditionally involves the skills\nof many people: artist, designer, composer,\neditor and even paste-up artist. The authors\nemphasize that the multimedia computer allows\nall these tasks to be performed by one\nindividual, levering resources and reducing co-\nordination problems. The chapter is\ninformative, and avoids using DTP jargon,\ndefining technical terms where necessary. The\nauthors discuss particular DTP software\npackages for integrating text with graphics, and\nhighlight some dangers in selecting software for\nDTP.\nComputer visualization and its potential for\nmarketing design concepts to clients is\nintroduced in Chapter 2. The chapter explains\nthe importance of creating realistic pictures and\nexperiences through which clients can\nappreciate designers' ideas. Through multi-\nmedia technology, dynamic and stimulating\nelectronic simulations can now replace the\nstatic, cardboard models of buildings and other\ncomplexes. Clients can investigate photo-\nrealistic images and take virtual walks through\narchitectural structures. Various aspects of\nvisualization are discussed, including 3-D\nmodelling, parametric modelling, animation,\nvirtual realities, and use of the Internet for\nconducting online design business. Following\nthis discussion is a practical demonstration of\nhow to use the 3-D Studio graphics package for\nrendering a building.\nConcentrating on the use of film footage,\nChapter 3 examines the role which digital video\nplays and the key tasks involved in using video\nin a multimedia presentation. A detailed plan of\nthe steps required to add video to a presenta-\ntion is suggested, and a diagram summarizes the\nwhole process of weaving multimedia elements\ntogether to create a composite product. Some\nuseful advice on marketing with video is also\npresented as a dialogue between the author and\na practising design consultant.\nChapter 4 explores online marketing. Design\nfirms should not overlook this critical\ndevelopment given the explosive growth in the\nWorld Wide Web. Predictions indicate that\n1998 will see one hundred million people\n78\nALT-} Volume 5 Number 2\nconnected - a potential customer base worthy\nof any company's attention. To guide\ncompanies through the process of getting\nconnected, an outline plan is provided.\nIllustrations of company Web sites complement\nthe text by showing what existing businesses are\ndoing online. The chapter concludes with an\nuseful commentary on future prospects for\nonlinesarchitecture.\nMore technical aspects of multimedia\npresentation and design are introduced in\nChapter 5. The effects of project scale and\ncomplexity are considered, together with the\nproblems created by having a wide range of\nelectronic formats and standards in which\ndigital information, whether text, images, sound\nor video, can be stored. Again, industry\nstandard software for assembling and managing\nthe various components of a multimedia\npresentation is discussed, featuring Macro-\nmedia and Authorware. Comments on\nmultimedia from an educator's perspective\nconclude the chapter.\nChapter 6 treats delivery media, evaluating\ntheir relative advantages and disadvantages.\nThe media discussed range from traditional\npaper, through compact disk technology, to\nvideo-conferencing. Client circumstances often\ndictate the choice of media and, as the authors\nwarn, it is pointless developing a presentation\nwhich requires equipment the client does not\nown. Again, practical advice is offered about\nhow to make the delivery decision and\novercome potential problems which may arise.\nFinally, presented as an interview between the\nauthor and members of an award winning\ndesign firm, Chapter 7 summarizes many of the\npoints made in preceding chapters and puts\nthem into a real context by using the\nexperiences of an actual design firm - a useful\ncase illustration.\nThis book meets a number of objectives: it is\neasy to read, offers much practical advice on\nmultimedia marketing for design, provides case-\nstudy illustrations, assesses the merits and\ndemerits of many industry standard packages\nfor undertaking the work involved, and shows\nhow to exploit multimedia technology to\nimpress clients and secure contracts. The book\nis specifically aimed at firms in the business of\narchitecture and design, but it is also a good\ntext for a wider audience interested in multi-\nmedia marketing. Informative without being\nover-technical, this is a book suitable for both\nlaymen and designers. Surprising, then, that in\na work written by designers for designers, all\nthe illustrations are in black and white!\nPeter Dwyer, University ofTeesside\nMultimedia, Hypermedia and Virtual Reality:\nModels, Systems and Applications (Lecture\nNotes In Computer Science, 1077) edited by: P.\nBrusilovsky, P. Kommers and N. Streitz,\nSelected papers from the First International\nConference, MHVR 94, Moscow, September\n1994, New York: Springer-Verlag., 1996. ISBN:\n3-540-61282-3. 309 pages, paperback. No price\nindicated.\nSpringer in their Lecture notes in Computer\nScience series allow current research ideas to\nmeet the academic community in a faster but\nmore complete form than would otherwise be\npossible. The concept of a book dealing with\nissues in multimedia, hypermedia and virtual\nreality, while looking at these areas from the\nperspective of design models, systems require-\nments and potential applications, is a good one.\nIn practice, however, this book represents little\nmore than a collection of papers on these topics\n(24 in all) grouped rather loosely into six\nsections. However, each is headed by a useful\nintroduction which tries (in most cases\nsuccessfully) to outline the contributions. Many\nof the papers are well-written and thought-\nprovoking, but a few represent poorly\nworked-up research papers or trivial attempts\nat scholarship. Overall, the book has an\nannoying lack of consistency in layout,\ntypography and style, but for all that it is still\nworth a read.\nThe first section deals with hypermedia\narchitecture models. The topics range from\ncomputer-based support for systems engineer-\ning to document linking and embedding for\ndistributed hypermedia databases and 3-D\nhyperdocuments. The third paper in this section\n(by Keith Andrews and Michael Pilcher) will be\nof particular interest to researchers exploring\nVRML models on the World Wide Web, and\nprovides a wealth of practical help and support\nincluding the VRweb tool ftp and http site\naddresses.\nThe second section takes enhancing multimedia\nsupport as its theme. CPN (Coloured Petri\nNets), neurocomputing image-encoding, and\nanimated help systems fall under this category.\nThe paper by Claire Dorman on designing\nonline animated help for multimedia\n79\nReviews\napplications is both informative and very\naccessible. Her exploration of simulation,\nanimation and visual rhetoric is compelling.\nNext we have an excellent group of papers on\nvirtual-reality technologies and applications.\nDede, Salzman and Loftin's paper on virtual\nreality for learning Newtonian mechanics,\nHand's paper on augmented and alternative\nrealities, and Tegolo's paper on dynamic visual\nicons and their fusion into a user's virtual space\nare all extremely thought-provoking. Two other\npapers deal with hardware and performance\nissues. Pose and Regan propose the concentric\nsphere method to reduce virtual-reality latency\n- this poses the interesting question: Did the\nancient Greeks have a concept of virtual reality?\nWhile they probably did not, their view of the\nheavens is the inspiration behind Pose and\nRegan's virtual-reality modelling approach.\nThe section on hypermedia for group\ncollaboration is a little disappointing in that it\nconcentrates on the concepts and techniques\navailable to support CSCW (Computer\nSupported Co-operative Learning) and video-\nconferencing. While these are well enough\npresented, a more detailed exploration of the\nexperiences of users and uses would have\nprovided a better balance here.\nHypermedia and multimedia for learning is a\nparticular theme of many of the papers in this\nbook as well as being the focus of attention for\nthe fifth section. The paper by Kommers sets\nthe scene with two proposals for Ph.D. research\ninto media support for collaborative design. We\nmight be left questioning where this leaves the\nreader, except that it is immediately followed by\ntwo papers, one by Boyle and Davies\n(hypermedia environments for learning to\nprogram) and another by Millwood and\nMladenova (educational multimedia: how to\nallow for cultural factors) which specifically set\nout to answer some pertinent and practical\ncourseware-design questions. Petrushin's paper\non HELENA (a shell for creating educational\nhypermedia applications) and Morozov's on\nmultimedia lectures and the LECTOR-MM\nauthoring system, show what can be done even\nwith minimal resources.\nThe book finally turns to personalized\nhypermedia. The areas of concern are largely\nsupport for individual structuring of\ninformation which may be based on a metaphor\n(such as Waterworth's 'archipelago, island,\nbuilding, floor' metaphor, or the 'personal\nbook' of Subbotin and Subbotin) or adaptive\nhypermedia (Brusilovsky's excellent paper and\nZyryanov's short contribution). It is\nparticularly gratifying to find that the. focus of\nthe book turns to user-modelling and cognitive\nissues even if a little belatedly.\nThis, then, is a book which has the potential to\nexcite, inform and teach. It is not a book to be\nread from first page to last, but a random dip\ninto its covers will often come up with an\ninteresting trinket and the occasional valuable\ntreasure.\nSteve Green, University ofTeesside\nEducational Multimedia and Hypermedia 1996:\nProceedings of Ed-Media 96 World Conference\non Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia\n(June 17-22) edited by Patricia Carlson and\nFillia Makedon, Boston MA: Association for the\nAdvancement of Computing in Education, 1996.\nISBN: 1-880094-21-5. 880 pages, paperback.\n$45.\nThis is a large volume documenting the\nproceedings of the 1996 Ed-Media conference\nheld in Boston. It contains over 260\ncontributions, and deals with - as it says on the\ncover - educational multimedia and hyper-\nmedia. Inside, however, the preface explains\nthat the book also incorporates the World\nConference on Educational Telecommunica-\ntions (Ed-Telecom 96), so the book contains\nsome straight telecommunications papers, too:\nfor example, on educational TV. The\ndefinitions of the terms multimedia and\nhypermedia are also a little stretched in places.\nAn example is in the very first paper which\ninvestigates motivation in drill-and-practice\nsoftware that is barely multimedial. And there\nare methodologies for formal software\nspecification, AI papers on good old Intelligent\nTutorial Systems, and suggestions for email\nmetrics. So, what we have in this book is a rich\npot-pourri, with the titular thread running\nthrough most of the contributions, but by no\nmeans all of them.\nThe preface goes on to explain that at the\nconference there were over 300 presentations\nin 22 major areas. Unfortunately, we are not\ntold what those areas were: the editors of\nthe proceedings have abandoned any useful\nsense of structure and have simply collated\nthe contributions in named alphabetical\norder within five sections: full papers, panels,\nround tables, short papers and posters\/\n80\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\ndemonstrations. Of the five, the full-papers\nsection is by far the biggest, with over 100\npapers, most about six pages long. There are 73\nshort papers, of a single page, five panel\ndiscussions at three pages each, three single-\npage round tables, and summaries of 81 posters\nor demonstrations. In organizing them by the\ntype of their presentation and alphabetically,\nthe editors have made it difficult to extract\ncoherent themes. So, within the full papers,\nthere are contributions on classroom use of\ntechnology, computer-assisted language\nlearning, navigation and data visualization in\nhypermedia systems, cognitive modelling,\nhypermedia architecture, learning by authoring,\ninterface design and HCI, some case studies on\nlearning strategies using hypermedia as a tool,\nand much more. In some contributions there is\na tendency to include a few pictures in a CAL\nsystem and call it multimedia, although there\nare also some on the most actively developing\nhypermedia and multimedia fronts. A small\nnumber of papers deal with the Web, Java and\nHTML (I would imagine that there will be\nmany more this year) and some interesting\nmultimedia applications - for example, using\nvirtual reality in urban planning, and to teach\nbasic science concepts.\nSince this is a (more or less) comprehensive\ncollection of conference papers, many simply\nsay 'this is what we are doing', or offer the\nexposition of pet authoring systems, etc. It is a\ncommon complaint in the field that too much\nwork is done in isolation from the past and\nfrom contemporary work elsewhere: there is\nlittle feeling of development, of work building\nupon past successes. The field is changing\nrapidly, but through technological upgrading,\nnot theoretical success. And the lack of a\ncentral spinal theory or model of learning upon\nwhich everyone agrees and upon which specific\nstudies could take their place is felt everywhere\nand reflected in this book. Do we really need in\n1996 another paper to tell us as part of its\nconclusions that 'adaptive hypermedia based on\nstudent learning styles provides the ability to\nindividually tailor the presentation of course\nmaterial to each student'?\nNevertheless, the conference lives up to its claim\nas a world event with contributors to the\nproceedings from the USA, Canada, Mexico,\nAustralia, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong,\nMalaysia, Korea, Russia, Europe and elsewhere\n(although all papers are in English). It is\ngratifying to see the spread of work in CAL (or\nwhatever) world-wide, if a little disheartening to\nsee sometimes that same wheel being invented\none more time.\nThere is a list of publications on the AACE\nWebsite (http:\/\/aace.virginia.edu\/aace\/pubs\/\npublisthtml). At the time of writing, the list has\nnot been updated to include this book, although\nit does contain the proceedings from the 1995\nconference and gives an idea of the fields that\nwere covered. It would be useful if some more\ndetailed breakdown of the contents could be\ngiven when these current proceedings are listed.\nMany of us will be using the Web route to find\ninformation on such conference books, and\nbeing given a large range of general topics,\ncovered is not that helpful.\nThe method of production, with everyone\npresumably supplying camera ready copy to\ntheir own standards, means a variety of fonts,\nsizings and spacings. But in a book of this size,\nthis is actually quite beneficial since it breaks its\npotentially monolithic nature.\nOverall, as a record of a conference, the book\ndoes its job, even if a little basically, but I would\nhave preferred to have some sort of thematic\nstructure. It would also have been nice to have\nhad some commentary or evaluation of the\nconference - even the preface is simply the\nconference welcome speech.\nAs in any collection of this size, there are some\npapers etc. that do not really contribute that\nmuch, but its wide-ranging nature means that\nthere is plenty to interest the CAL practitioner\nor researcher who wants to dip and browse.\nBill Hubbard, Sheffield University\nAspects of Educational and Training Technology,\nXXIX: Implementing Flexible Learning edited by\nChris Bell, Mandy Bowden and Andrew Trott,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1997. London ISBN:\n0-7494-1874-5. Hardback. No price indicated.\nThis book may be regarded as something of a\nmemorial, as it comprises the proceedings of the\nlast conference of the Association for\nEducational and Training Technology (AETT)\nheld in Plymouth in 1995. The reason for this\nconference being the last in the series is that the\nAETT ceased to exist as an independent\norganization on 31 December 1995 when it was\ntransmogrified into the Learning Technologies\nGroup of the Staff' and Educational\nDevelopment Association (SEDA).\n81\nReviews\nReviewing the proceedings of a conference is\nnot quite so straightforward a task as reviewing\na conventional text. How can one assess the\nvalue of such a publication to those who were\nnot actually present at the event? The benefits\nof conference attendance generally emerge from\nthe complex set of personal interactions, both\nformal and informal, which take place\nthroughout, rather than from the papers\nthemselves. As a result, taken in isolation,\nproceedings from even quite spirited\nconferences often seem curiously devoid of life\nwhen taken in isolation. One measure of success\nmight be that taken as a whole, the papers\nprovide a snapshot of current thinking in the\nsubject area of the conference theme, in this\ncase Implementing Flexible Learning. Thus,\nexperienced readers keep abreast of most recent\ndevelopments, while those new to the area may\nacquire a fast track into the literature.\nHowever, this publication does not achieve that\nkind of success. Perhaps this is due to the rather\nnebulous nature of the theme, illustrated by the\nfollowing quotation from the keynote address\nby Professor Henry Ellington of Robert\nGordon University:\n'[flexible learning] is now gaining widespread\nacceptance as a generic term covering virtually\nall situations where the learner has some\ncontrol over the way in which learning occurs.'\nAnd on reading the papers presented, the\nimpression given is that in a number of them do\nnot represent the mainstream academic activity\nof their authors: those which reference relatively\nlittle new work in refereed journals.\nHowever, this does not mean that the book\nshould be regarded as a failure. Many of the\npapers report interesting and innovative\nteaching developments which might provide\nreaders with food for thought for their own\nclasses., although this would have been made\nmore likely by some attempt at categorization\nof the subject areas covered. In view of the\nbroad definition of flexible learning given\nabove, it might have been expected that the\nconference organizers would have focused\ninterest groups by addressing a number of\nthemes through parallel streams. If one bases\none's view on this book, it did not occur: there\nis no logical structure to the collection of 34\npapers which follow the keynote address. Given\nthis lack of structure, the provision of both an\nauthor index and a subject index would have\nbeen a welcome addition, but some sample titles\nmay give an indication of the kinds of areas\ncovered: Providing flexible opportunities for\noverseas students at masters level using peer\nsupport: Implications for student and lecturer a\ncomputer-based introduction to learning skills;\nAutomated assessment of IT skills models of\nknowledge; Learning and representation for\nmultimedia learning environments.\nThe Editorial refers to the period of decline\nexperienced by the AETT in the 1980s and\n1990s, when membership of the association\ndeclined and conference attendance fell steadily\nfrom year to year. There is an expectation that\nthe merger with the larger SEDA organization\nreferred to above will provide a new lease of\nlife. It is to be hoped that this will prove to be\nthe case.\nLorraine Warren, University of Lincolnshire and\nHumberside\n82\n"}
