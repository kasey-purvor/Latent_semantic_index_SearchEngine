A database for turbulent \nflame properties is needed both for practical uses and developing multi-dimensional models for \nnumerical simulations. Unfortunately still only few experimental studies are available for detailed \nhigh pressure premixed turbulent flame, especially under different temperature and fuels. \nKobayashi et al. [1-2] used a Bunsen burner with perforated plates within a constant pressure \nchamber operated up to 3.0 MPa. His schlieren images showed finer turbulence structures in high \npressure environments than at low pressure. Soika et al.[3] used a bluff body stabilized flame up to \n1.1 MPa. They indicated the effect on the smaller turbulence scale and flame instabilities by \npressure. Lachaux et al.[4] studied lean premixed (\u00d8=0.6) flames up to 0.9 MPa using a Bunsen \nburner. They studied the wrinkling scales, flame front curvature and surface density by using LDA \nand Mie scattering tomography. They showed that the increased pressure can cause small scale \nflame structures but roughly constant integral length scales. \n In the present study, we use a synthetic gas mixture, designated \u2015Ruhr Gas\u2016, typical of \ncompositions used in mid-Europe, which contains significant amounts of ballast and higher \nhydrocarbons. The turbulent flame velocity measurements were taken under different pressures and \ntemperatures. \n \n2 Experimental Hardware Design & Construction \nA turbulent flame speed experiment with a jet-stabilized pre-mixed flame having optical access for \nLDA and schlieren analysis was constructed.  The design of the jet nozzle and its velocity and \nturbulence profiles was explored using CFD (FLUENT) and checked by cold experiment. The \ncriteria of primary importance for the nozzle flow are taken as uniform mean and turbulent velocity \nand mixture concentration distributions at the jet exit, with steep wall gradients. The maximum \nsustainable grid-induced turbulence levels are about 8% from an area contraction ratio of 7.29, with \nthird-order wall profile and a nozzle exit diameter of 20mm: the intrinsic, clean jet turbulence is \n~1.5%.  Flame stabilization was provided by a thin rim, the outer face of which formed the inner \nannulus of the flame root stabilization diffusion flame fuel supply. The outer wall of the diffusion \nflame flow-path was heavily cooled by radiation to a water jacket: the diffusion flame fuel was not \npre-heated.      \nTo reduce risk and experimental tuning of apparatus to a minimum, CFD simulation was used to \nguide the design of the flow-path of the experiment, in particular for the jet nozzle profile and \nturbulence generator, and for a heat transfer study of the high-pressure casing and optical windows. \nThe tasks were broken down into nozzle and turbulence generator studies, combustion chamber \nflow and heat transfer.   \nPreparation of a homogeneous pre-mixed fuel: air mixture close to the point of use has difficulties \nand contradictory requirements, given the relative fuel and air mass and momentum ratios available \nand the final range of nozzle exit velocity. It was decided to pre-mix the fuel and air upstream of the \nnozzle and control the wall boundary layer growth to minimize flashback propensity and produce a \nwell-controlled shear layer with the stabilization flow.   \n \n2.1 Jet Nozzle & Turbulence Generator \nThe mean flow and mixture concentration fields at the nozzle exit must be controllable, \nsymmetrical and, ideally, flat, with similar characteristics over a range of nozzle Reynolds Number. \nA conventional round jet with exchangeable turbulence generator plates was used to enable \nturbulence levels to be varied. To minimize the possibilities of flashback during combustion, the \nwall boundary layer should be thin and continuous, with the highest level of induced turbulence \nsustainable and the lowest intrinsic (i.e. clean) turbulence level in the core flow for each case. The \nconventional method of using an accelerated flow to achieve low intrinsic turbulence has the risk \nthat any flashback of the flame may propagate into a large space holding combustible mixture. A \nstudy of the contraction area ratio, wall profile and exit velocity distribution showed that a third-\norder wall profile and AR of ~8 would produce the required mean flow field.   \nThe turbulence generator flow should be sufficiently mixed prior to the exit plane to minimize the \nopportunity for aerodynamic flame-holding. Surveying flow conditioner design showed that the \nsimple perforated grid-plate design represented a solution [5], enabling simple tuning using the \norifice area and few restrictions on manufacture. A numerical study was run to indicate the \noptimum grid-plate porosity and hole size, with hole spacing, radial and circumferential, adjusted.   \n\u00f8 2.00 mm\n\u00f8 2.30 mm\n\u00f8 24.00 mm\n\u00f8 24.60 mm\n2mm thick at 40mm to the exit of the nozzle \n1:7:14:21:21\nR 10.55 mm\nR 2.60 mm\nR 5.20 mm\nR 7.80 mm\n\u00f8 1.80 mm\n \n \n \nFig. 1 The turbulence generation plate and Test lines \nThe test for the velocity and turbulence intensity:  \n  \nFig. 2 Velocity & Turbulence distribution \n2.2 Performance Check of the Nozzle, Turbulence Generator & Mixer \nDetailed construction of the components required close-tolerance CNC machining of many mating \nparts forming the final assembly. The assemblies were made in stainless steel and copper and \nvacuum-brazed together. Before committing to this step, the CNC programmes and fluid dynamic \nperformance of the designs were checked using aluminium models at full-size, run with air at the \noperating nozzle Reynolds Number range expected in the combustion experiments. Mean and \nfluctuating velocity in the jet was measured using HWA. In the case of the mixer, helium was used \nas a tracer, with a mass spectrometer to map concentration fields across the nozzle exhaust plane.   \n \n2.3 Pressure Casing and Internal Combustion Liner  \nA twin-wall, convectively cooled inner liner was taken as the basic design. The casing was \nfabricated from carbon steel to standard pressure vessel design codes and standards. Provision for \nfour windows aligned on two orthogonal, axially off-set diameters was made: the windows were \nmade of laser-quality fused quartz glass, resiliently mounted in a frame that formed the cooling and \nventilation gallery for window purge. Blanks were made for the window apertures not used. \nProvision was made to move the nozzle vertically with respect to the window axis to enable \nvariations in flame location to be accommodated without major re-alignment of the optical axis.   \nThe internal double-skinned stainless steel combustion liner was insulated with a high-grade \nmaterial and wall film-cooled. The inside was painted with matt black high-temperature paint to \nminimize reflection.   \nHeat transfer analysis was performed for the high pressure containment. The concerns are that for \nthe size of jet and its heat release, the wall thermal losses could appreciably alter the quasi-adiabatic \nboundary condition of the practical gas turbine combustor flames for which model data is sought, \nand the thermal loading and stressing of the optical windows. The casing for the experiment is then \na compromise between size (mass and pressure capability) and modification to the jet flow \n(chamber diameter\/volume) and the relative energy input. At the maximum condition for which data \nwas sought, the maximum heat release from the jet flame was ~36kW. The solution applied used a \nseparate internal insulated liner to limit radial and axial heat loss. This was contained in a light-\ngauge metallic structure to approximate a realistic radiative boundary. The pressure vessel had some \nrelatively large apertures necessary for windows with views across and oblique to the jet axis to \npermit optical measurements. The thermal losses from the windows could not be compensated but \nthose windows not used for any set of measurements were covered with appropriately constructed \nblanks.   \n \n2.4 The Schlieren System \nMost premixed turbulent flames of practical interest are within the flamelet regime. Thin flamelets \nalso mean that the flame zone is characterized by large density gradients. This offers high \nsensitivity to the application of light deflection techniques such as schlieren, deflection mapping \nand interferometry. A typical flamelet oriented parallel to the incident beam direction produces a \ndensity gradient orthogonal to the beam and because schlieren is only sensitive to density gradients \northogonal to the beam, flamelets normal to the beam direction will be transparent. For the conical \nflame configuration, schlieren can outline the flame cone very clearly [6]. \nThe optical system was built around a folded-path arrangement using large spherical mirrors, \ndiameter 305mm, to reduce distortion.  Images were generated using a Xenon flash lamp source \n(100hz repetition rate, 60w average input, 2.90us average flash duration) driven by a signal \ngenerator and CCD camera (1024 1260 resolution) to capture the images.  Image files were \ndumped directly to a PC hard drive.  The window apertures were 100mm and the whole window \narea could be imaged.   \n \n2.5 Experiment Control System \nThe main features are shown schematically below. Thermal mass-flow meters\/controllers were used \nfor air and fuel feed.  These were check-calibrated at intervals throughout the experiments.  Rig \npressure was maintained by an exhaust regulating valve or fixed orifice, depending on need.  \nCoolant was supplied to the jet nozzle jacket under manual control.  Spark ignition, driven by a \nconventional HV transformer, was used with a retractable electrode.     \n  \nFig. 3 Overview of the experimental rig \nData was acquired from digital pressure transducers, the mass-flow controllers and thermocouples \nand logged to PC using standard methods.  Some on-line data reduction enabled the operator to \ncontrol rig health, safety and set-point conditions.   \n \n3  Results  \nThe flame speed is determined by the angle method (ST=Usin( \/2), where U is the mean velocity of \nmixture at the tube outlet,  is the vertex angle of the mean flame region). \nThe initial testing phase established a stable flame and consistent conditions.  Flame root \nstabilization was provided using the test fuel, although the apparatus would burn without diffusion \nsupport over a reasonable equivalence ratio at room temperature.  All the data presented is with root \nstabilization, for consistency.   \nAt elevated pressure, the flame brush became shorter and less well-defined, with the degree of \ndefinition becoming less as the nozzle Reynolds Number was increased.  It was possible to reduce \nthe pilot stabilization flow to a small value.   The illustration shows typical results on the test fuel.   \n \n P=0.1MPa \n \nP=0.3MPa \n \nP=0.7MPa \nFig. 4 Instantaneous images under different pressures \nTo commission the schlieren apparatus, the system was operated at atmospheric conditions, with all \nthe elements of flash-lamp source, pinhole, mirrors, lens, knife edge, filter, and camera to assess \nany degradation in image quality arising from the windows.   \nSome experimentation with knife-edge was required to achieve good image quality and the \nphotographs show a change in knife-edge position.   \nSchlieren images from the elevated pressure experiments illustrate the difficulty of data \nmanipulation to arrive at flame speed.  Although the flame is stable, there is sufficient shot-to-shot \nvariation to give a fuzzy appearance to the averaged image and binary image extraction was \nnecessary to provide a consistent density gradient interpretation. \n \nGood schlieren images were obtained after some tuning. The effects of flame radiation were \ncontrolled using a filter in front of the camera lens and short camera shutter duration (1 ms). Using \nthe filter preserved the dynamic range of the CCD, thus reducing errors due to saturation.  \nThe short shutter speed minimized image blurring from flame oscillation in space. The flash lamp \nfrequency was set to be 100 Hz, and the trigger was set synchronously for the camera and the lamp \ngiving clear,sharp images The original instantaneous images were taken from the CCD at 256 grey \nscales, and an averaged image was determined by an average of pixel data taken from fifty images. \nA program was written to find the digital profile of flame front mainly according to the brightness \nof the edge, assuming axisymmetry of the flame. In the program, the flame zone was firstly chosen \nfrom the averaged image, the threshold value was determined considering the intensity histogram \nand average pixel data for each scan line.  \nThe number of images taken for the results in the paper is 50, however, more images were used in \ndevelopment (in increments up to 300), and no obvious difference was found between these cases, \nthis might because of the relatively sharp difference between the background and the flame image. \nFurthermore, turbulence generator, nozzle configuration, stabilized diffuse flame and chamber \nvolume were carefully designed to minimize the perturbation (shear flow) caused by the edge of the \nnozzle and outside flow together with the heat loss.  \n \nThe illustration shows the development of a typical schlieren record from a single instantaneous \nimage to a 50-image average and its derived intensity profile for conditions of   \u00d8 =0.9 at 700kPa \nchamber pressure.   \n    \nFrame 001 06 Oct 2005 Example: Simple XY Plot\n \nInstantaneous Image                           Averaged Image           Digital Profile \nFig. 5 Illustration for image processing \nInstantaneous and averaged schlieren images, with derived flame envelope over a range of \nconditions were taken.

When adding the term (T\/T0), the \nexponent is nearer to the value given in [14], this may imply the temperature acts inversely to the \npressure, Fig 10.  \n \n5 Conclusions  \nIn this work, turbulent flame speeds ST were measured over a range of pressures to 0.8MPa using a \njet-flow apparatus fired with a synthetic mixture representing a mid-European natural gas. The gas \ncontained significant proportions of ballast gases and higher hydrocarbons which affect the \nturbulent velocity.  \nThe following results are obtained: \nAn asymptotic tendency of the ST\/SL curves with increasing u'\/SL was seen, although this is not \nentirely clear due to the reduced data set available under high pressures.  \nA power law of ST\/SL with (P\/P0)(u'\/SL) was obtained using the vertex angle from the mean flame \ncone by schlieren imaging, which shows comparable agreement with other authors [12].  \nAlso as ST correlates to Damk\u00f6hler and Karlovitz number, a pressure modification term (P\/P0)\nn\n may \nbe helpful to get better correlations. \nFurther work should be carried to study the high turbulence velocity and the pressure and \ntemperature modification items (P\/P0, T\/T0) in the correlations. \n \n6 Acknowledgments \nThe flame speed work formed part of a European Commission Framework V project, completed \nunder EC Contract No. ENK5-CT-2000-00060.   \n \n \nReferences \n1.
