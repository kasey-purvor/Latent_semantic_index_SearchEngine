This characterisation\nprovides a full geometric explanation of the resonance phenomenon. In addi-\ntion, we develop techniques based on normal form theory to give a complete\nsolution to the associated bifurcation problem.\n1 Introduction\nSpiral waves in planar excitable media exhibit intriguing dynamics, some of which\nis now well-understood from the point of view of dynamical systems with symmetry.\nThe underlying symmetry group is SE(2) (rotations and translations in the plane)\nand the simplest possible solution is a relative equilibrium where the time evolution\nis a rigid rotation in the plane.\nMany people observed the onset of quasiperiodic behaviour where the tip of the\nspiral wave traces out a two-frequency \u201cflower\u201d pattern instead of a perfect circle. This\nbehaviour was termed meander by Winfree [18]. Barkley et al. [3] and Karma [12]\npointed out Hopf bifurcation as a mechanism for meander, and this was confirmed\nexperimentally for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction by Li et al. [14]. The analysis\nto this point makes use only of the group SO(2) of rotations (though we note that\nthe distinctive nature of the flower patterns associated with meander is due to the\nfull SE(2) symmetry [11]) and is in accordance with the theory of Krupa [13] for\n1\nlocal bifurcations from relative equilibria in systems with compact symmetry. The\nbifurcating \u201cmodulated rotating waves\u201d are examples of relative periodic solutions.\nNumerical experiments [1] and chemical experiments [14] exhibited a codimension\ntwo point where the Hopf frequency equals the frequency of the rotating spiral wave\nand the meandering motion of the spiral tip is replaced by linear drift. In a landmark\npaper, Barkley [2] correctly explained this phenomenon as a new type of resonance\nin systems with Euclidean symmetry.\nThe first mathematically rigorous results on the transition to linearly drifting\nspirals were obtained by Wulff [19], and these results were further developed in [8,\n10, 11, 16]. In particular, Fiedler et al. [8] generalised the theory of Krupa [13] to\napply to general finite-dimensional Lie groups, provided the isotropy subgroup of the\nunderlying relative equilibrium is compact. (This condition is certainly satisfied for\nspiral waves.)\nSubsequently, Wulff [20] extended the rigorous analysis in [19] to general finite-\ndimensional Lie groups, including the group SO(3). This example is relevant to the\nbehaviour of spiral waves on a sphere and the resonance phenomenon is very similar\nto the planar case. The underlying spiral wave rotates rigidly on the surface of the\nsphere about an axis through the centre of the sphere, and Hopf bifurcation leads to\ntwo-frequency meandering about a typically nearby axis. At a resonance (where the\nHopf frequency equals the rotation frequency) the meander is about an axis almost\nperpendicular to the original axis. See also [6, 7].\nFrom the point of view of doing calculations, the case of compact SO(3) symmetry\nis much more difficult than the noncompact SE(2) case \u2014 SE(2) is solvable and the\nequations of motion along the group orbit can hence be solved explicitly by successive\nintegrations and Fourier analysis [10]; in contrast SO(3) is semisimple. Chan [6]\nused the normal form technique of Fiedler & Turaev [9] to overcome the problem of\nsemisimplicity and obtained an elegant solution to the SO(3) case.\nThere still remained a lack of clarity of the nature of the resonance phenomenon\nitself. Fiedler & Turaev [9] gave a Lie algebraic definition of resonance in terms of the\nstructure of equations when transformed to normal form: degeneracies leading to the\nexistence of extra monomials in the normal form equations were termed resonances.\nWulff [20, Definition 2.5] gave a more geometric but still infinitesimal Lie-theoretic\ndefinition of resonance which is equivalent to the condition in [9]. However, neither\npaper establishes a link between the definition and the observed dynamical phenom-\nena.\nIn this paper, we focus on the situation where the group of symmetries is a com-\npact Lie group. We give a geometric definition of resonance, based on the theory of\nmaximal tori, that agrees perfectly (and provably) with the observed global dynamics.\nWe note that in both the SE(2) and SO(3) examples, typically the bifurcating relative\nperiodic solution is close (as a set in phase space) to the underlying relative equilib-\nrium. It is precisely at a resonance that this closeness breaks down. In Theorem 3.8,\nwe prove that our definition of resonance is equivalent to this setwise continuity prop-\n2\nerty for the dynamics. In Proposition 3.10, we prove that our definition coincides\nwith the definitions in [9, 20]. A consequence is that resonance is a codimension two\nphenomenon for every nonabelian compact Lie group (and is impossible for abelian\ngroups).\nIn the remainder of the introduction, we sketch our approach to resonance. More\nbackground and full details can be found in the ensuing sections. Recall that a\nrelative equilibrium is a solution of the form x(t) = exp(t\u03b7)x(0) where \u03b7 is a Lie\nalgebra element. A relative periodic solution is a solution y(t) that is not a relative\nequilibrium and satisfies y(T ) = \u03c3y(0) for some T > 0. The least such T is called the\n(relative) period and \u03c3 is called a spatiotemporal generator.\nHopf bifurcation from a relative equilibrium x(t) = exp(t\u03b7)x(0) leads to a branch\nof relative periodic solutions y\u03bb(t) satisfying y\u03bb(T\u03bb) = \u03c3\u03bby\u03bb(0), where T\u03bb \u2192 2pi\/\u03c9b as\n\u03bb \u2192 0 and \u03c9b > 0 is the Hopf frequency. The relationship between \u03b7 and \u03c3\u03bb (see\nProposition 2.1) is that\n\u03c3\u03bb \u2192 \u03c30 = exp 2pi\u03c9b \u03b7.\nTypically, \u03c30 is a regular element lying in a unique maximal torus. In this case, we\nsay that the Hopf bifurcation is nonresonant. Otherwise, \u03c30 is singular and we say\nthat the Hopf bifurcation is resonant.\nIn other words, resonance occurs precisely when the Hopf frequency \u03c9b is such\nthat exp 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 is a singular element of G.\nOur main aim in this paper is to clarify the phenomenon of resonance by intro-\nducing the above definition and connecting it to the dynamics. A secondary purpose\nis to use the equivalence with the definition of Fiedler & Turaev to tie this in with\nChan\u2019s use of normal form theory. In particular, we extend Chan\u2019s approach in the\nSO(3) case to give a complete treatment of Hopf bifurcation (nonresonant and reso-\nnant) from relative equilibria with trivial isotropy subgroup in systems with compact\nsymmetry.\nRemark 1.1 (a) In principle, the results in this paper could be extended to systems\nwith general noncompact symmetry group, based on a study of the dependence of\n(the closure of) a topologically cyclic subgroup on its generator. Additional technical\nissues to be overcome are the possible noncompactness of such subgroups, and the fact\nthat the exponential map need not be onto. For certain groups such as the universal\ncover of SL(2,R), there are elements for which no power lies in the image of the\nexponential map [15, p. 164], so that Floquet-theoretic arguments are problematic.\nIn the absence of motivating examples, we have chosen to restrict to the case of\ncompact symmetry groups where the theory is particularly clean and illuminating.\n(b) An important class of examples for applications is Euclidean-type groups of the\nform G n Rn where G is a compact Lie group acting on Rn. It is possible to make\nprogress on an ad-hoc basis given that the issues for G are already solved in this paper\nand there are no theoretical difficulties arising from the Rn factor. Originally, we\n3\nintended to cover Euclidean-type groups here, but were aware of the danger of an ad-\nhoc approach without sufficient fully worked-out examples; the absence of theoretical\ndifficulties does not exclude interesting phenomena. This was confirmed by recent\nsomewhat surprising calculations of Chan [5] in the case of the Euclidean group\nSE(3) (isometries of three-dimensional space). We hope to explore the ramifications\nof these calculations more carefully in future work.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains background\nmaterial on Hopf bifurcation from relative equilibria. In Section 3, we give our ge-\nometric characterisation of resonance. In Section 4, we use normal form theory to\nsolve the bifurcation equations at a nonresonant or resonant Hopf bifurcation.\n2 Hopf bifurcation from relative equilibria\nLet G be a Lie group and let X be a finite-dimensional vector space. Consider\nparametrised skew product equations on G\u00d7X of the form\ng\u02d9 = g\u03be(x, \u03bb), x\u02d9 = f(x, \u03bb), (2.1)\nwhere \u03be : X \u00d7R\u2192 LG, f : X \u00d7R\u2192 X are smooth maps, and \u03bb \u2208 R is a bifurcation\nparameter. Denote solutions of these equations by (g\u03bb(t), x\u03bb(t)). We assume that\ng\u03bb(0) = e. (The initial condition x\u03bb(0) is of little consequence here.)\nSet \u03be(0, 0) \u2261 \u03b7, f(0, 0) \u2261 0, so that at \u03bb = 0 there is the relative equilibrium\n(g0(t), x0(t)) = (exp t\u03b7, 0). (2.2)\nSuppose that the relative equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at \u03bb = 0. Generi-\ncally, after centre manifold reduction, we may suppose that X = R2 \u223c= C, f(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0,\nand (df)0,\u03bb = \u03b1(\u03bb) + i\u03b2(\u03bb), where \u03b1(0) = 0, \u03b1\n\u2032(0) > 0, \u03b2(0) = \u03c9b > 0. We call \u03c9b the\nHopf frequency.\nThe Hopf theorem guarantees that generically there exists a unique branch of\nperiodic solutions x\u03bb(t) for the x\u02d9-equation with period 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb) where \u03c9b(0) = \u03c9b.\nTo fix notation, we suppose that the branch of periodic solutions is supercritical\n(\u03bb > 0).\nThe periodic solution x\u03bb(t) corresponds to a relative periodic solution (g\u03bb(t), x\u03bb(t))\nfor equation (2.1) with relative period 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb) and spatiotemporal generator \u03c3\u03bb =\ng\u03bb(\n2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n).\nProposition 2.1 lim\n\u03bb\u21920+\n\u03c3\u03bb = \u03c30 where \u03c30 = exp\n2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7.\nProof Write T\u03bb = 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb) and T0 = 2pi\/\u03c9b. It follows from a standard mean\nvalue theorem argument that g\u00b5(T\u03bb) \u2192 g\u00b5(T0) uniformly in \u00b5 \u2208 [0, \u00b50] for \u00b50 > 0\n4\nsufficiently small. Therefore\n|\u03c3\u03bb \u2212 \u03c30| \u2264 |g\u03bb(T\u03bb)\u2212 g\u03bb(T0)|+ |g\u03bb(T0)\u2212 g0(T0)|\n\u2264 sup\n\u00b5\u2208[0,\u00b50]\n|g\u00b5(T\u03bb)\u2212 g\u00b5(T0)|+ |g\u03bb(T0)\u2212 g0(T0)| \u2192 0,\nas \u03bb\u2192 0+.\nNote that \u03b7 \u2208 LG determines the long-term behaviour of the relative equilibrium\n(g0(t), x0(t)) whereas \u03c3\u03bb \u2208 G determines the long-term behaviour of the relative\nperiodic solutions (g\u03bb(t), x\u03bb(t)). Proposition 2.1 describes the connection between \u03c3\u03bb\nand \u03b7.\nConvergence in phase space In the Hopf bifurcation in the x\u02d9-equation, the\nbranch of periodic solutions consists of loops S\u03bb = {x\u03bb(t) : t \u2208 R} \u2282 X that satisfy\nS\u03bb \u2192 0 (uniformly) as \u03bb\u2192 0+. Similarly, the relative equilibria and relative periodic\nsolutions define flow-invariant sets\nE = {(g0(t), 0) : t \u2208 R} \u2282 G\u00d7 {0}, P\u03bb = {(g\u03bb(t), x\u03bb(t)) : t \u2208 R} \u2282 G\u00d7 S\u03bb, (2.3)\nin the phase space G \u00d7 X. However, P\u03bb need not converge to E in any reasonable\nsense as \u03bb\u2192 0+. We will argue that this nonconvergence characterises resonance.\nRemark 2.2 For compact Lie groups, the exponential map exp : LG\u2192 G is surjec-\ntive. Hence we have the Floquet representation\ng\u03bb(t) = exp(\u03b7\u03bbt)R\u03bb(t)\nwhere \u03b7\u03bb \u2208 LG is chosen so that \u03c3\u03bb = exp \u03b7\u03bb, and R\u03bb : R\u2192 G is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic.\nAgain, there need not exist choices such that \u03b7\u03bb \u2192 \u03b7 as \u03bb\u2192 0+.\n3 Resonance in compact Lie groups\nIn this section, we specialise the relative Hopf bifurcation in Section 2 to the case when\nG is a compact connected Lie group. In Subsection 3.1, we recall background material\non maximal tori in G. In Subsection 3.2, we define resonance and we characterise\nresonant bifurcations in terms of the nonconvergence of the relative periodic solutions\nP\u03bb to the underlying relative equilibrium E.\nThroughout, the Lie groupG and its Lie algebra LG are identified with sets of n\u00d7n\nmatrices. We have the adjoint actions Ad : G\u2192 Aut(LG) and ad : LG\u2192 End(LG)\ngiven by Adg(\u03be) = g\u03beg\n\u22121 (g \u2208 G, \u03be \u2208 LG) and ad\u03b7(\u03be) = \u03b7\u03be \u2212 \u03be\u03b7 (\u03b7, \u03be \u2208 LG)\nrespectively.\n5\n3.1 Background on maximal tori\nHere, we collect some standard results about maximal tori in compact connected Lie\ngroups [4, 17].\nLet G be a compact connected Lie group with metric | |. A torus T contained in\nG is maximal if it is not contained in a torus of larger dimension. Every element of G\nlies in at least one maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate. The common\ndimension of the maximal tori is called the rank of G, denoted rankG.\nAssociated to each g \u2208 G is the closed subgroup H(g) = {gn : n \u2208 Z}. Such\nsubgroups H are called topologically cyclic and have the form H \u223c= Tp \u00d7 Zq for some\n0 \u2264 p \u2264 rankG and q \u2265 1. The set of g for which H(g) is a maximal torus is residual\nand of full Haar measure in G.\nSimilarly, each Lie algebra element \u03be \u2208 LG generates a one-parameter subgroup\nin G, the closure of which is a torus. The torus is maximal for \u03be lying in a residual\nset of full Lebesgue measure in LG.\nDefinition 3.1 An element g \u2208 G is regular if g lies in a unique maximal torus.\nOtherwise, g is called singular.\nLet U \u2282 G be the set of regular elements. Then U is open and dense in G with\nfull Haar measure, and\n{g \u2208 G : H(g) is a maximal torus} \u2282 U,\nMoreover, the set G\u2212U of singular elements has codimension at least three in G [17,\nTheorem VIII.7.7].\nLet Z(g) = {h \u2208 G : gh = hg} denote the centraliser of g. Then dimZ(g) \u2265\nrankG with equality if and only if g is regular, in which case Z(g)0 is the unique\nmaximal torus Tg containing g. Moreover, Z(g)0 is a torus if and only if it is a\nmaximal torus. (Here, Z(g)0 denotes the connected component of Z(g) containing\nthe identity.)\nExample 3.2 If G is abelian, for example G = SO(2), then G is a torus and hence\nthere is a unique maximal torus in G, namely G itself. In particular, every element\nof G is regular.\nThe next simplest case is the group G = SO(3), the group of 3 \u00d7 3 orthogonal\nmatrices with determinant 1. Let g be a nonidentity element of SO(3). By Euler\u2019s\nrotation theorem, g is a rotation about some axis and we can choose coordinates so\nthat g =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 0sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 for some \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 2pi). Any torus containing g lies in\nZ(g)0, so let h \u2208 Z(g)0. Then h preserves the eigenspaces of g so h = h1\u2295h2 where h1\nis a 2\u00d7 2 matrix commuting with\n(\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n)\nand h2 = \u00b11. Since h \u2208 Z(g)0,\n6\nwe must have h2 = 1 and then h1 =\n(\ncos\u03d5 \u2212 sin\u03d5\nsin\u03d5 cos\u03d5\n)\nfor some \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2pi). This\nshows that Z(g)0 \u223c= SO(2), so g lies in a unique maximal torus and this torus has\ndimension 1. Hence rankSO(3) = 1 and the only singular element of SO(3) is the\nidentity element.\nFor A,B \u2282 G, define the (nonsymmetric) distance from A to B,\ndist(A,B) = sup\na\u2208A\ninf\nb\u2208B\n|a\u2212 b|.\nThe set PG of subsets of G is a metric space with Hausdorff metric\nd(A,B) = dist(A,B) + dist(B,A).\nProposition 3.3 The map U \u2192 PG given by g 7\u2192 Tg is continuous.\nProof Note that Tg = Z(g)0 = exp ker(Adg \u2212 I). As a vector space, ker(Adg \u2212 I)\ndepends continuously on g except at changes in dimension, but dimker(Adg \u2212 I) is\nconstant for g \u2208 U . Moreover ker(Adg \u2212 I) = LTg for g \u2208 U . Hence g 7\u2192 LTg\nis continuous (on U). To make this precise, put the Hausdorff metric on compact\nsubsets of LG. Then g 7\u2192 LTg\u2229C is continuous in this metric for all compact subsets\nC \u2282 LG.\nBy the uniform continuity of exp on compact subsets, it follows that g 7\u2192\nexp(LTg \u2229 C) is continuous. Choose C \u2282 LG to be an Ad-invariant compact neigh-\nbourhood of 0. Given S \u2282 G and n \u2265 1, define Sn = {gn : g \u2208 S}. For a fixed\nmaximal torus T, there exists n \u2265 1 such that (exp(LT \u2229 C))n = T. Since C is\nAd-invariant and all maximal tori are conjugate, it follows that n does not depend\non the choice of maximal torus. Hence g 7\u2192 (exp(LTg \u2229 C))n = Tg is continuous.\nThus, Tg depends continuously on g \u2208 U . Moreover, G\u2212U consists of discontinuity\npoints in the following sense. If g1\u03bb and g\n2\n\u03bb are smooth curves in G with g\n1\n0 = g\n2\n0\nsingular, then typically: (i) g1\u03bb, g\n2\n\u03bb \u2208 U for \u03bb 6= 0 small, and (ii) both dist(Tg1\u03bb , Tg2\u03bb) 6\u2192 0\nand dist(Tg2\u03bb , Tg1\u03bb) 6\u2192 0 as \u03bb\u2192 0.\n3.2 Definition of resonance\nWe return to the skew-product system (2.1). Associated to the relative equilibrium\nsolution (exp t\u03b7, 0) in (2.2) is the torus T0 = {exp t\u03b7 : t \u2208 R} \u2282 G. We assume\nthroughout that T0 is a maximal torus. In particular\nker ad\u03b7 = LT0. (3.1)\nRemark 3.4 Condition (3.1) holds for an open and dense, full measure set of ele-\nments \u03b7 \u2208 LG. The assumption that {exp t\u03b7 : t \u2208 R} is a maximal torus holds on a\nresidual full measure set, but fails for a dense set of elements \u03b7 when rankG \u2265 2.\n7\nDefinition 3.5 The Hopf bifurcation in (2.1) is nonresonant if \u03c30 = exp\n2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 is a\nregular element of G. Otherwise, the Hopf bifurcation is resonant.\nExample 3.6 If G is abelian (including G = SO(2)), we have seen that there are\nno singular elements, so resonant Hopf bifurcation is impossible according to Defini-\ntion 3.5.\nIf G = SO(3), then by Example 3.2, \u03c30 = exp\n2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 is singular if and only if it\nis the identity element. We can write \u03b7 \u2208 LSO(3) as \u03b7 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0 \u2212\u03c9r 0\u03c9r 0 0\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 and\nso \u03c30 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed cos 2pi\u03c9r\u03c9b \u2212 sin 2pi\u03c9r\u03c9b 0sin 2pi\u03c9r\n\u03c9b\ncos 2pi\u03c9r\n\u03c9b\n0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8. It follows that \u03c30 is resonant if and only if\nm\u03c9b = \u03c9r for some m \u2265 1.\nIn particular, the resonance condition for SO(3) is identical in form to Barkley\u2019s\nresonance condition for the Euclidean group SE(2). In general, the resonance condi-\ntion depends on the group G, see Examples 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15.\nLemma 3.7 (a) Suppose that the Hopf bifurcation is nonresonant. Then there ex-\nists \u03b4 > 0 such that \u03c3\u03bb lies in a unique maximal torus T\u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03b4), and\nlim\u03bb\u21920+ d(T\u03bb,T0) = 0.\n(b) If the Hopf bifurcation is resonant, then generically there exists \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat \u03c3\u03bb lies in a unique maximal torus T\u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 (0, \u03b4). However, generically\ndist(T\u03bb,T0) 6\u2192 0 and dist(T0,T\u03bb) 6\u2192 0 as \u03bb\u2192 0+.\nProof Part (a) follows from openness of U and Proposition 3.3. Part (b) follows\nfrom open-density of U and the comments after Proposition 3.3.\nRecall that H(\u03c3\u03bb) = {\u03c3n\u03bb : n \u2208 Z}. For \u03c3\u03bb regular, we have H(\u03c3\u03bb) \u2282 T\u03bb. More-\nover, generically (for all but countably many parameters in a generic one-parameter\nfamily) H(\u03c3\u03bb) = T\u03bb.\nWe defined E and P\u03bb in (2.3). Note that E = T0 \u00d7 {0}. Also P\u03bb is a\nH(\u03c3\u03bb)-invariant flow-invariant subset of G \u00d7 X with P\u03bb\/H(\u03c3\u03bb) \u223c= S\u03bb. Generically,\nH(\u03c3\u03bb) = T\u03bb in which case P\u03bb \u223c= T\u03bb\u00d7S\u03bb is quasiperiodic with rankG+1 independent\nfrequencies.\nTheorem 3.8 (a) If the Hopf bifurcation is nonresonant, then\nlim\u03bb\u21920+ dist(P\u03bb, E)\u2192 0 and typically lim\u03bb\u21920+ d(P\u03bb, E)\u2192 0.\n(b) If the Hopf bifurcation is resonant, then typically dist(P\u03bb, E) 6\u2192 0 and\ndist(E,P\u03bb) 6\u2192 0 as \u03bb\u2192 0+.\nProof Part (b) is immediate from Lemma 3.7(b).\n8\nFor \u03bb \u2265 0, let G\u03bb = {g\u03bb(t) : t \u2265 0}. (Note that G0 = T0.) To prove the first\nstatement in part (a), we must show that dist(G\u03bb,T0)\u2192 0.\nWrite G\u03bb =\n\u22c3\nn\u22650G\u03bb(n) where G\u03bb(n) = {g\u03bb(t) : 2npi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb) \u2264 t \u2264 2(n +\n1)pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)}. Then for each fixed n, we have d(G\u03bb(n), G0(n)) \u2192 0. In particular\ndist(G\u03bb(n),T0)\u2192 0 for each n.\nNow G\u03bb(n) = \u03c3\nn\n\u03bbG\u03bb(0). By Lemma 3.7(a), dist(T\u03bb,T0) \u2192 0 and so\ndist(\u03c3n\u03bb ,T0)\u2192 0 uniformly in n. Hence dist(G\u03bb(n),T0) \u2192 0 uniformly in n so that\ndist(G\u03bb,T0)\u2192 0 as required.\nMoreover, generically H(\u03c30) = T0. In this case, we have d(H(\u03c3\u03bb),T0) \u2192 0,\nd(G\u03bb,T0)\u2192 0, and d(P\u03bb, E)\u2192 0, completing the proof of part (a).\nRemark 3.9 It is natural to consider setwise convergence in Lemma 3.7 and Theo-\nrem 3.8. Note that pointwise convergence, lim\u03bb\u21920+(g\u03bb(t), x\u03bb(t)) = (g0(t), 0) for each\nfixed t, is automatic. On the other hand, it would be too much to require that\nlim\u03bb\u21920+ supt |g\u03bb(t)\u2212 g0(t)| = 0.\nFor compact Lie groups, our definition of resonance coincides with the definitions\nin [9, 20]:\nProposition 3.10 Suppose that the relative equilibrium in (2.2) undergoes Hopf bi-\nfurcation with frequency \u03c9b. Then resonance occurs if and only if ad\u03b7 has eigenvalues\n\u00b1im\u03c9b for some m \u2265 1.\nProof Let d = rankG. Then g \u2208 G is singular if and only if dim ker(Adg \u2212 I) > d.\nTaking g = exp 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7, we have Adg = exp ad 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7, and so ad 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 has at least d + 1\neigenvalues in 2piiZ. It follows from (3.1) that ad\u03b7 has precisely d zero eigenvalues\nleaving at least two eigenvalues of the form \u00b1im\u03c9b, m \u2265 1.\nRemark 3.11 For G abelian, all elements are regular and hence resonance never\noccurs. In contrast, resonant Hopf bifurcation is always of codimension two when the\ncompact Lie group G is not abelian.\nTo see this, first note that the Hopf bifurcation itself is codimension one. It suffices\nto show that the set of \u03c9b > 0 for which exp\n2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 is singular consists of isolated points\nbut is nonempty. Since G is not abelian, dimG > rankG, so it follows from (3.1)\nthat ad 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 has nonzero eigenvalues. Since G is compact, these eigenvalues are purely\nimaginary. As \u03c9b varies, the eigenvalues pass through 2piiZ\u2212{0} yielding the required\ncodimension two points by Proposition 3.10.\nDefinition 3.12 In the case of resonant Hopf bifurcation, let m \u2265 1 be least such\nthat \u00b1im\u03c9b are eigenvalues of ad\u03b7. Then the resonance is m\u2019th order.\nExample 3.13 Consider the group G = SO(n) for n = 2d even. Let S denote the set\nof matrices that have the block diagonal structure R\u03b81\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295R\u03b8d , where R\u03b8j \u2208 SO(2)\n9\nhas eigenvalues e\u00b1i\u03b8j , 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 pi. Obviously S \u2208 Z(g) for all g \u2208 S and it is easily\nverified that Z(g)0 = S if and only if \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8d are all distinct. In particular S is a\nmaximal torus and rankSO(n) = d = n\/2.\nWe can suppose that \u03b7 \u2208 LS with eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03c9j where \u03c91 > \u03c92 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \u03c9d > 0.\nThen exp 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03b7 is singular if and only if 2pi\n\u03c9b\n\u03c9j = \u00b12pi\u03c9b\u03c9k mod 2pi for some j, k yielding\nthe condition for resonance\nm\u03c9b = \u00b1\u03c9j \u00b1 \u03c9k, m \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 d.\n(Of course, in the special case G = SO(2), the resonance condition is never satisfied.)\nExample 3.14 The case G = SO(n) = SO(2d+1) with n odd is similar to the even\ncase, taking S to be the set of matrices R\u03b81 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295R\u03b8d \u2295 1. We obtain rankSO(n) =\nd = (n \u2212 1)\/2 and the condition for regularity is that the \u03b8j are all distinct and\ndifferent from 0.\nThis time, \u03b7 has eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03c9j and 0 where \u03c91 > \u03c92 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \u03c9d > 0. We\nobtain the conditions for resonance\nm\u03c9b = \u00b1\u03c9j \u00b1 \u03c9k, m \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 d,\nand\nm\u03c9b = \u00b1\u03c9j, m \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d.\nExample 3.15 Consider the special unitary group G = SU(n), n \u2265 2, consisting\nof n \u00d7 n complex matrices A satisfying A\u2217A = I and detA = 1. Let S denote the\n(n\u22121)-torus consisting of diagonal complex matrices g \u2208 SU(n). The diagonal entries\n\u03b1j \u2208 C, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n satisfy |\u03b1j| = 1 and \u03b11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b1n = 1. Obviously, S \u2208 Z(g) for all\ng \u2208 S and it is easily verified that Z(g)0 = S if and only if the \u03b1j are distinct. In\nparticular, S is a maximal torus and rankSU(n) = n\u2212 1.\nWe can suppose that \u03b7 \u2208 LS, so that \u03b7 is diagonal with distinct nonzero entries\ni\u03c9j where \u03c91 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c9n = 0. Hence exp 2pi\u03c9b \u03b7 is singular if and only if m\u03c9b = \u03c9j \u2212 \u03c9k\nfor some m \u2208 Z\u2212 {0} and 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 n.\nIn the case n = 2, the diagonal matrices g \u2208 S have \u03b12 = \u03b1\u00af1 and so are singular if\nand only if g = \u00b1I. Hence U = SU(2)\u2212{\u00b1I}. Moreover \u03b7 \u2208 LS has diagonal entries\n\u00b1\u03c9r and the condition for resonance reduces to m\u03c9b = 2\u03c9r. In particular, resonances\nfor SU(2) occur twice as often as for SO(3) corresponding to the fact that SU(2) is\nthe double cover of SO(3).\n4 Solving the skew product equations\nWe return to the skew-product equations (2.1). The Hopf bifurcation in the x\u02d9-\nequation yields a branch of periodic solutions x\u03bb(t) with period 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb) where\n\u03c9b(\u03bb) depends smoothly on \u03bb and \u03c9b(0) = \u03c9b. Substituting into the g\u02d9 equation,\n10\nwe obtain g\u02d9 = g\u03be(x\u03bb(t), \u03bb). If G is abelian, then we can solve explicitly to obtain\ng\u03bb(t) = exp\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03be(x\u03bb(s), \u03bb)ds. In the nonabelian case, we generalise the approach of\nChan [6] making use of the normal form theory of Fiedler & Turaev [9]. The reduction\nto normal form is carried out in Subsection 4.1. The solutions to the normal form\nequations are presented in the nonresonant and resonant cases in Subsections 4.2\nand 4.3 respectively.\n4.1 Reduction to normal form\nSuppressing the parameter \u03bb momentarily and following Fiedler & Turaev [9], we\ntransform the skew product equations (2.1) by a near-identity change of coordinates\nx 7\u2192 P (x), g 7\u2192 g expQ(x),\nwhere P : R2 \u2192 R2 and Q : R2 \u2192 LG are polynomial maps. The transformation P\nputs x\u02d9 = f(x) into the standard Birkhoff normal form up to any finite order:\nz\u02d9 = f\u02dc(|z|2, \u03bb)z,\nwhere f\u02dc : R \u00d7 R \u2192 C is a polynomial. This has the solution z\u02d9 = r(\u03bb)ei\u03c9b(\u03bb)t where\nr(\u03bb)2 and \u03c9b(\u03bb) are smooth functions of \u03bb, with \u03c9b(\u03bb) = \u03c9b + O(\u03bb) and r(\u03bb)\n2 =\na\u03bb+O(\u03bb2) where typically a 6= 0.\nOn adding the terms in the tail, it is well-known that z\u03bb(t) persists as a periodic\nsolution with frequency \u03c9b(\u03bb) = \u03c9b +O(\u03bb).\nNext we turn to the g\u02d9-equation. Define Ym = ker(ad\u03b7 + im\u03c9bI) \u2282 LG (complexi-\nfied).\nLemma 4.1 Through any required order, \u03be can be transformed to the following nor-\nmal forms:\nNonresonant case \u03be(z, z\u00af, \u03bb) = h1(|z|2, \u03bb) where h1 : R\u00d7 R\u2192 LT0.\nm\u2019th order resonance \u03be(z, z\u00af, \u03bb) = h1(|z|2, \u03bb) + zmh2(|z|2, \u03bb) + z\u00afmh\u00af2(|z|2, \u03bb)\nwhere h1 : R\u00d7 R\u2192 LT0, h2 : R\u00d7 R\u2192 Ym.\nProof Let k, ` \u2265 0 and \u03b6 \u2208 LG. Following Fiedler & Turaev [9, Definition 1.1],\nwe say that the monomial zkz\u00af`\u03b6 is \u201cresonant\u201d if \u03b6 is an eigenvector for \u2212ad\u03b7 with\neigenvalue i\u03c9b(k\u2212 `). It follows from Fiedler & Turaev [9, Theorem 1.2] that through\narbitrarily high order, all terms in \u03be can be removed except for the resonant mono-\nmials.\nZero eigenvalues (k = `) are characterised in (3.1) and yield the h1 terms. In the\nnonresonant case, there are no further eigenvalues of the form i\u03c9b(k\u2212 `). In the case\nof an m\u2019th order resonance, we have eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03c9bm, so taking k\u2212 ` = \u00b1m yields\nthe h2 terms.\n11\n4.2 Nonresonant case\nIn this subsection, we use Lemma 4.1 to solve the nonresonant case.\nTheorem 4.2 In the nonresonant case, for each k \u2265 1,\ng\u03bb(t) = exp{t\u03b7k(\u03bb)} exp{Qk(t, \u03bb) + Ek(t, \u03bb)},\nwhere\n(i) \u03b7k(\u03bb), Qk(t, \u03bb), Ek(t, \u03bb) \u2208 LG depend smoothly on\n\u221a\n\u03bb,\n(ii) Qk = O(\n\u221a\n\u03bb) and Ek = o(\u03bb\nk),\n(iii) Qk(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0 and Ek(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0,\n(iv) t\u2192 Qk(t, \u03bb) is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic,\n(v) \u03b7k(\u03bb) = \u03b7 +\n\u221a\n\u03bb adb\u03b7 +O(\u03bb) \u2208 LT\u03bb = Adexp q(\u03bb)LT0, where q(\u03bb) =\n\u221a\n\u03bbb+O(\u03bb)\nand b is a general element of LG.\nIn particular, the spatiotemporal generator \u03c3\u03bb = g\u03bb(2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)) satisfies\n\u03c3\u03bb = exp\n{\n2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\nAdexp q(\u03bb)[\u03b7 +O(\u03bb)]\n}\n= exp\n{\n2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n[\u03b7 +\n\u221a\n\u03bb adb\u03b7 +O(\u03bb)]\n}\n.\nProof Working first in the normal form coordinates, and neglecting the tail terms,\nwe substitute the 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic solution z\u03bb(t) into the normal form for \u03be. In the\nnonresonant case, we have\ng\u02d9 = gh1(r(\u03bb)\n2, \u03bb) = g\u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb),\nwhere \u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb) \u2208 LT0 is a smooth function of \u03bb and \u03b7\u02c6(0) = \u03b7. We can solve explicitly to\nobtain the normal form solution g\u03bb(t) = exp(t\u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb)).\nTransforming back to the original coordinates, g\u03bb(t) = exp(t\u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb)) exp(\u2212q(t, \u03bb))\nwhere q(t, \u03bb) \u2208 LG is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic with leading term of order\n\u221a\n\u03bb. In order to\nsatisfy the initial condition g\u03bb(0) = e, we premultiply by exp(q(0, \u03bb)) obtaining (by\nequivariance) the solution\ng\u03bb(t) = exp(q(0, \u03bb)) exp(t\u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb)) exp(\u2212q(0, \u03bb)) exp(Q(t, \u03bb)),\nwhere Q(t, \u03bb) is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic with leading term of order\n\u221a\n\u03bb, and Q(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0.\nHence, g\u03bb(t) = exp(t\u03b7(\u03bb)) exp(Q(t, \u03bb)) where \u03b7(\u03bb) = Adexp(q(0,\u03bb))\u03b7\u02c6(\u03bb). Writing q(\u03bb) =\nq(0, \u03bb) =\n\u221a\n\u03bbb+O(\u03bb), we obtain \u03b7(\u03bb) = \u03b7 +\n\u221a\n\u03bbadb\u03b7 +O(\u03bb).\nFinally, we note that the Floquet representation for g\u03bb(t) may change when the\ntail terms are included. However, g\u03bb(t) itself will be unchanged except up to a (non-\nperiodic) term Ek = o(\u03bb\nk).\nA useful abbreviation is to say that g\u03bb(t) = exp(t\u03b7(\u03bb)) exp{Q(t, \u03bb)} beyond all\norders where\n12\n(i) \u03b7(\u03bb), Q(t, \u03bb) \u2208 LG depend smoothly on \u221a\u03bb,\n(ii) t\u2192 Q(t, \u03bb) is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic, Q = O(\n\u221a\n\u03bb), and Q(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0,\n(iii) \u03b7(\u03bb) = \u03b7 +\n\u221a\n\u03bb adb\u03b7 + O(\u03bb) \u2208 LT\u03bb = Adexp q(\u03bb)T0, where q(\u03bb) =\n\u221a\n\u03bbb + O(\u03bb)\nand b is a general element of LG.\n4.3 Resonant case\nIn this subsection, we assume that there is an m\u2019th order resonance. Substitute\nz\u03bb(t) = r(\u03bb)e\ni\u03c9b(\u03bb)t into the normal form for \u03be in Lemma 4.1 (neglecting tail terms)\nto obtain the equation\ng\u02d9 = g[\u03b7(\u03bb) + \u03bbm\/2eim\u03c9b(\u03bb)t\u21260(\u03bb) + \u03bb\nm\/2e\u2212im\u03c9b(\u03bb)t\u2126\u00af0(\u03bb)], (4.1)\nwhere\n\u03b7(\u03bb) \u2208 LT0, \u21260(\u03bb) \u2208 Ym = ker(ad\u03b7 + im\u03c9bI).\nViewing (\u03b7(\u03bb), \u03c9b(\u03bb)) \u2208 LT0\u00d7R as parameters, generically there is a codimension\none set near (\u03b7(0), \u03c9b(0)) = (\u03b7, \u03c9b) for which \u00b1im\u03c9b(\u03bb) are eigenvalues of ad\u03b7(\u03bb). This\nis the set of resonant parameters.\nAt such a resonance, working modulo terms of order \u03bbm\/2+1 in (4.1), we can\nreplace \u21260(\u03bb) by the appropriate eigenfunction (still denoted \u21260(\u03bb)) of ad\u03b7(\u03bb) so that\nad\u03b7(\u03bb)\u21260(\u03bb) = \u2212im\u03c9b(\u03bb)\u21260(\u03bb). Let \u2126(\u03bb) = \u21260(\u03bb) + \u2126\u00af0(\u03bb).\nTheorem 4.3 Suppose that \u00b1im\u03c9b(\u03bb) are eigenvalues of ad\u03b7(\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2265 0. Then\ng\u03bb(t) = exp{t[\u03c1(\u03bb) + \u03bbm\/2\u2126(\u03bb)]} exp{Q(t, \u03bb) + E(t, \u03bb)},\nwhere\n(i) \u03c1(\u03bb),\u2126(\u03bb), Q(t, \u03bb), E(t, \u03bb) \u2208 LG depend smoothly on \u221a\u03bb,\n(ii) Q = O(\n\u221a\n\u03bb) and E = o(\u03bbm\/2),\n(iii) Q(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0 and E(0, \u03bb) \u2261 0,\n(iv) t\u2192 Q(t, \u03bb) is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic,\n(v) T\u03bb = {exp t\u2126(\u03bb), t \u2208 R} is a maximal torus for \u03bb \u2265 0,\n(vi) \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2208 LT\u03bb\u2229Adexp q(\u03bb)LT0, where q(\u03bb) =\n\u221a\n\u03bbb+O(\u03bb) and b is a general element\nof LG.\nIn particular, the spatiotemporal generator \u03c3\u03bb = g\u03bb(2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)) satisfies\n\u03c3\u03bb = exp\n{\n2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n[\n\u03c1(\u03bb) + \u03bbm\/2\u2126(\u03bb) + o(\u03bbm\/2)\n]}\n13\nProof By construction, Adexp t\u03b7(\u03bb)\u21260(\u03bb) = e\n\u2212im\u03c9b(\u03bb)t\u21260(\u03bb), and the solution to (4.1)\nis\ng\u03bb(t) = exp{t\u03bbm\/2\u2126(\u03bb)} exp{t\u03b7(\u03bb)}.\nLet T\u03bb denote the maximal torus defined by \u2126(\u03bb). Note that exp{t\u2126(\u03bb)} \u2208\nZ(exp 2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n\u03b7(\u03bb)) for all t. It follows that exp 2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n\u03b7(\u03bb) lies in Z(exp{t\u2126(\u03bb)}) for all t,\nand hence lies in Z(T\u03bb) = T\u03bb. In addition, exp 2pi\u03c9b(\u03bb)\u03b7(\u03bb) \u2208 T0. Hence, we have shown\nthat exp 2pi\n\u03c9b(\u03bb)\n\u03b7(\u03bb) \u2208 T\u03bb \u2229 T0.\nChoose \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2208 LT\u03bb \u2229 LT0 so that exp{ 2pi\u03c9b(\u03bb)\u03b7(\u03bb)} = exp{ 2pi\u03c9b(\u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb)}. Then g\u03bb(t)\ncan be written in the form\ng\u03bb(t) = exp{t[\u03c1(\u03bb) + \u03bbm\/2\u2126(\u03bb)]}R(t, \u03bb),\nwhere R(t, \u03bb) = exp{\u2212t\u03c1(\u03bb)} exp{t\u03b7(\u03bb)} is 2pi\/\u03c9b(\u03bb)-periodic.\nPassing back to the original coordinates and arguing as in the proof of Theo-\nrem 4.2, we obtain a solution of the form\ng\u03bb(t) = exp{t[\u03c1(\u03bb) + \u03bbm\/2\u2126(\u03bb)]} exp{Q(t, \u03bb)},\nwhere \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2208 Adexp q(\u03bb)LT0 and \u2126(\u03bb) \u2208 Adq(\u03bb)LT\u03bb. Tail terms leave g\u03bb(t) unchanged\nbeyond all orders.\nRemark 4.4 Note that the family of elements \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2208 LG correspond to singular\nelements of G. When G = SO(3), the only singular element of G is the identity and\nso \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2261 0. This accounts for the simplified form of the solutions in [6, 7, 20]. The\nnew phenomenon for more general groups is that after the bifurcation some of the T0\nfrequencies are retained, namely those in common with the new torus T\u03bb. The other\nT0 frequencies are switched off, while the non-common frequencies in T\u03bb set in at the\nslow \u03bbm\/2 rate.\nOf course, Theorem 4.3 is vacuous for abelian groups such as SO(2), since there\nare no resonant Hopf bifurcations.\nAcknowledgments DC wishes to think the University of Surrey and EPSRC for\nfinancial support via a Doctoral Studentship.
