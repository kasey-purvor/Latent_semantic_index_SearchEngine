Infrared and optical-ultraviolet absorption characteristics are reported \nand used to characterize the bonding and optical properties of these films. It has been found that \nthe optical band gap is not related to the hydrogen content in the films and varies according to \nthe dc self bias developed during deposition. The IR data show that the hydrogen in the \na-C\/diamond &ns is associated with triply bonded sp\u2019 carbon as in acetelyne. The optical band \ngap of the fihns can be varied from 1.2-4.0 eV. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn recent years amorphous semiconductors have been \nstudied extensively for the fabrication of electronic and \nphotovoltaic devices. Due to large area deposition capabil- \nities and the possibility of deposition on a variety of sur- \nfaces this relatively inexpensive amorphous material tech- \nnology has attracted much attention. \nDiamondlike carbon has been studied as an amorphous \nmaterial with technological potential since it was shown \nthat these films could be deposited using a chemical vapor \ndeposition (CVD) process.\u2019 Diamondlike carbon, a-C, a- \nC:H, ion-beam deposited carbon, u-C\/diamond all refer to \na material that contains varying amounts of the three al- \nlotropes of carbon. Namely diamond (sp3 bonds), graphite \n(sp\u201d) and carbyne (sp\u2019). Large band gap, extreme hard- \nness, chemical inertness, optical transparency over a wide \nrange of wavelengths, good thermal conduction, and elec- \ntrically insulating characteristics are some of the properties \nthat make amorphous carbon a technologically attractive \nmaterial. These diamondlike carbon films have been depos- \nited in a variety of ways. These include CVD ( microwave,2 \nrf,\u2018.and dc3), ion beam deposition4 and vacuum arc depo- \nsition.\u2019 \na-C\/diamond films are a form of diamondlike films \nwhich contain diamond crystallites, surrounded by a ma- \ntrix of amorphous carbon.6p7 These diamond crystals have \ndimensions of 20-200 mn and are seen in clusters in the \nu-C\/diamond films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \nshows these films to be pinhole free, but with a large com- \npressive stress that is in the GPa range.* Electronic char- \nacterization has shown the films to have resistivities in the \nrange of 106-10\u2019 fi cm.9 The major advantage of a-C\/ \ndiamond tilms compared to the more pure polycrystalline \ndiamond films are that they can be deposited on substrates \nkept at room temperature. Hence they are suitable as a \ncoating which has significant diamond content for materi- \nals such as polymers. \nIn this work we investigate the optical absorption \nproperties of a-C\/diamond films. It is found that the opti- \ncal band gap of these films can be changed by over a factor \nof three, by varying the deposition conditions. The depo- \nsition parameter which is found to be significant in deter- \nmining the optical band gap is the dc self-bias voltage in \nthe rf plasma. The relationship between the optical band \ngap, dc self-bias and the hydrogen content is investigated. \nIt is found that the hydrogen content is not directly related \nto the optical band gap. The experimental results are more \nin keeping with a change in the microstructure of the films \nwith varying dc bias as predicted by the subplantation \nmodel. lo \nEXPERIMENT \nThe films studied were deposited using rf plasma en-. \nhanced CVD. In this method a CH4\/Ar gas mixture is \nbroken down into C!+ ions and CH radicals in a predom- \ninantly Ar plasma by a capacitively coupled 13.56 MHz rf \npower generator. The sample which is placed on the lower \nelectrode is kept at 20 \u201cC! by a feedback controlled cooling \nsystem. Substrates used were {loo) n-type Si wafers of \n5-10 a cm resistivity. Before deposition, substrates were \ndegreased and then subjected to a 20 s preclean in an \nAr\u2019 ion plasma. The preclean was long enough to remove \nany native oxide on the Si, while minimizing damage to the \nSi surface. All depositions were performed at a pressure of \n300 mTorr. Deposition times for the a-C\/diamond films \nwere varied from 5-10 min. \nFor the first set of experiments, the CH4 to Ar ratio \nwas kept at S%, with the dc self-bias developed in the rf \nplasma enhanced CVD method, varied by adjusting the rf \npower. The dc self bias voltage which is developed between \nthe plasma and the electrodes, gives rise to an electric field \nwhich accelerates ions from the plasma onto the electrode. \nHence the energies of the ions taking part in film growth on \nthe substrates, which are placed on the lower driven elec- \ntrode, is closely related to the dc self bias voltage. Optical \nabsorption measurements were performed using a Perkin \nElmer Lambda 9 UV-VIS-IR spectrophotometer. The \nsample preparation and machine setup are explained else- \nwhere.\u201d In the second set of experiments, the dc self bias \nvoltage was kept at approximately -400 V, while the \nCl&-to-Ar ratio was varied between 0.1% and 8%. Infra- \nred (IR) measurements were performed using a Fourier \n1149 J. Appl.

Free standing a-C\/diamond membrane used for spectrophotom- \netry experiments. \ntransform Brucker spectrometer in the retlection mode. IR \ndata were calibrated against a Si sample. \nThe samples used for optical-UV (ultraviolet) spectro- \nphotometry were free standing a-C\/diamond membranes \nthat were supported on a Si frame. The sample dimensions \nwere of the order of 100 pm2 in area (Fig. 1). Membrane \ndimensions are limited by the film thickness and compres- \nsive stress present in the film. \nRESULTS \nNormalized optical transmission data together with \nthe Taut plots are given in Fig. 2. The figures show that an \noptical band gap variation from 1.2-4.0 eV can be achieved \nby varying the dc self-bias voltage across the electrodes. An \noptical band gap of 4 eV seems to indicate that under these \ndeposition conditions the a-C\/diamond films obtained, are \noptically similar to type I crystalline diamond. \nIn past work it was thought that the hydrogen in the \nfilms, always present in some finite quantity due to the use \nof a hydrocarbon source gas, influences the optical prop- \nerties. \u2018Z-*4 It was shown that the optical band gap de- \ncreased with an increase of hydrogen in the films. The \ndecrease in hydrogen in turn was thought to be related to \nthe increase in dc bias voltages in the plasma. The preva- \nlent model based on this view is that an increase in the dc \nbias voltage leads to the growing film being exposed to \nmore energetic ion bombardment, and that this gives rise \nto the removal of weakly bonded hydrogen in the films.13 \nThe model further suggests that more sp3 bonds will be \npresent in films deposited at a higher dc bias. \nTable I shows the tabulated IR peaks for the data \nshown in Figs. 3 and 4. Examination of the IR data gives \nsome interesting information regarding the hydrogen con- \ntent and the structure of the amorphous C in the films. \nTable II gives optical data derived from spectrophotometry \nand ellipsometry.

Applying the method used \nby Fujimoto et al., l6 the relative hydrogen content for these \nfilms was determined and the results are tabulated in Table \nII. DC81, with the highest H content is taken as having a \nrelative H content of 100%. \nThe IR spectra in Figs. 3 and 4, indicate that the ma- \njority of the hydrogen in the a-C\/diamond films is triple \nbonded sp\u2019 carbon as in acetelyne. There does not seem to \nbe any correlation between the triple bonded C-H content \nand the optical band gap variation obtained from the data \nin Fig. 2, and shown in Table II. Direct and indirect band \ngap measurements appearing in Table II have been calcu- \nlated by plotting (a)\u2019 vs hv, and (o~)*\u2018~ vs hv, respectively; \na being the absorption coefficient of the a-C\/diamond film. \nThese are the standard methods used in measuring the \noptical band gap for direct and indirect semiconducting \nmaterials. It is interesting to note that the band gap values \nobtained from the intercept of the Taut plot, the standard \nmethod for amorphous materials, closely follows. the values \nobtained by considering a-C\/diamond to be an indirect \nband gap material. \nThe very strong IR absorption at 3225 cm- \u2019 is consis- \ntent with that observed for hydrogen bonded to spl carbon, \nthe carbon forming a triple bond with another cabon as in \nacetelyne (H-C=C-H).

One possible interpretation is that these are ac- \netelynelike carbon chains in the films consistent with the \npresence of an intermediate \u201ccarbyne\u201d phase between \ngraphite and diamond. I7 The existance of such a carbon \nphase has been challenged by Smith and Buseck,18 who \nattributed the observed diffraction data to mineral impuri- \nties in the samples analyzed. We have also found some \nevidence of a nongraphitic hexagonal phase in the plasma \ndeposited films which are free from mineral impurities. \nThese hexagonal structures can be ascribed to carbynes.\u201d \nHowever, it is still unclear as to how acetelynelike carbon \nchains arrange themselves to give a hexagonal unit cell \nstructure. An alternative view is that the films have acete- \nlyne incorporated from the gas phase as it is thought to be \nthe stable byproduct remaining from CH4 plasma decom- \nposition.20 Either way the results confirm the incorporation \nof triple bonded sp\u2019 carbon. \nP \nI d \nB \nI \u2018C \ng \nd < \nI \nc -.---.+-p-. ~------+---~~ low ,500 2003 2500 3000 3500 4MM \nwavr Number, Em-~ \nFIG. 3.

The film with the lowest relative H content of 3%, \ndc61 ( - 160 V) has a relatively low optical band gap of \napproximately 1.2 eV. However, the film dc80 ( -265 V) \nhas a band gap of 4 eV and a relative H content of 5%. \nFurther increases in the dc bias voltage during deposition \nresult in an increase in the H content and a lowering of the \noptical band gap. This suggests that the role of the dc bias \nduring deposition is not simply to aher the properties of \nthe C films by altering the H content within them. Rather, \nthere seems to be a narrow window between - 160 V and \n-265 V dc bias, for the particular deposition parameters \nof pressure, CH4:Ar content and the temperature used, \nwhich influences the structure of the film to give a dramatic \nincrease in the optical band gap from 1.2 to 4 eV. Note that \ncomparing films dc80 and dc62 deposited at -265 V and \n-320 V, the relative H content rises from 5% to 19%, but \nthe optical band gap reduces from 4 to 2 eV. \nKhan et aL21 too, did not see a systematic variation in \nthe optical properties of their films with hydrogen content. \nOne reason for there being no correlation between the op- \ntical properties and the hydrogen content could be due to \nthe structural components that constitute our films. In the \nFIG. 5. Characteristic IR spectrum of a-C\/diamond films. \na-C\/diamond films studied here, the amorphous compo- \nnent is not a mixture of sp2 and sp\u201d bonded C, but rather, \npredominantly sp\u2019 carbyne hybridizations, as suggested by \nthe IR data. \nThe IR spectra in Fig. 5 is typical of the a-C\/diamond \nfilms. All the IR spectra appearing in Figs. 3 and 4, show \na similar appearance in this fingerprint region. This signa- \nture of a-C\/diamond films is dominated by C-H aromatic \nabsorptions. Two of the peaks appearing are assigned to \nthe Raman microcrystalline\/amorphous diamond and \namorphous carbon vibrations. Table I gives the assign- \nments of the peaks appearing in Fig. 5. \nAbsorption peaks appearing in Fig. 5 at 1205, 1064, \nand 780 cm-\u2019 are attributed to out-of-plane aromatic \nC-H bending modes. Peaks at 1592, 1568, and 1493 \ncm-\u2019 are assigned to aromatic C=C stretches. Stretching \nmodes characteristic of sp2 hybridized CHs groups give rise \nto absorptions at 3080 and -3010 cm-\u2018; bending vibra- \ntions of the groups -produce absorptions at 1280 and 990 \ncm -I. CHs groups with sp3 hybridization give rise to an \nasymmetric stretching mode absorption at 2960 cm-\u2018, and \na deformation mode at 1430 cm-\u2018. \nRaman active modes for graphite and diamond pro- \nduce peaks at 1575 and 1330 cm-- \u2018, respectively. A subsid- \niary peak found at around 1350 cm- \u2019 is attributed to a-C. \nThe corresponding vibration mode is active for crystallites \nof llnite size and its intensity varies inversely with the di- \nameter of the crystals. The feature seen in the spectra of \nour films at 1352 cm-\u2019 is identified to be a-C. \nThe 1167 cm-\u2019 line seen in spectra of a-C\/diamond \nfilms is also attributed to this Raman active mode of mi- \ncrocrystalline or amorphous diamond. Nemanich et al.22 \nobserved a strong Raman peak at - 1140 cm- \u2019 and de- \nduced that this line was caused by microcrystalline dia- \nmond regions. They further stated that, by comparing \nwurtzite diamond with the frequencies for Sic, the most \nintense Raman peak characteristic of microcrystalline. dia- \nmond would be expected to occur at - 1175 cm-\u2018. \nFigure, 4 shows the variation of a-C\/diamond films \ndeposited at approximately the same dc self bias, but with \na varying CH4:Ar ratio.

The IR peak CONCLUSIONS \naround 3300 cm-\u2018, indicates triple bonded C-H which \ndominates the spectra appearing in Fig. 4, as seen in the \ncase of Fig. 3. This suggests that in the a-C\/diamond films \ndeposited by our system, the majority of the hydrogen in \nthe films is triple bonded C-H carbyne hybridizations. \nAt low CH, concentrations, the relative number of hy- \ndrocarbon species present in the chamber is small and \nwould lead to thinner a-C\/diamond films. This is seen in \nfilms dcll4 to dcll7. -4s expected the films deposited with \na higher CH4 concentration, are thicker (dcll8 and \ndc128). Considering the number of C-H species present \nin the chamber during deposition, the films deposited at \nhigher CH, concentrations should have more H incorpo- \nrated into them. This is not, however, the case for a-C\/ \ndiamond films, since the film deposited at 8% CH&r ra- \ntio (highest C&%0> has the lowest H content in the film \n(Table III>. \nThe behavior of the optical band gap of a-C\/diamond \nfilms can be better explained by using the subplantation \nmodel proposed by Lifshitz et a1.l\u2019 In this model energetic \nCf ions impinge on the growing C surface and create a \nsubsurface layer. In this subsurface layer it is increasingly \nfavorable for sp3 bonded C to form and diamond crystalli- \nzation to occur. The more energetic the ions, the better \nsuited they are to form a metastable diamond phase and \nthis is perhaps what the initial increase in the optical band \ngap reflects. At around -265 V an optimum condition is \nreached and a band gap of 4 eV is recorded. As the energy \nof the Cc ions further increase, the model suggests that the \nionized species have sufficient energy to amorphize the \ngrowing film. This then should result in a drop in the \noptical band gap of the material. This drop in band gap is \nseen in our results with increasing dc bias. An interesting \nresult is that the peak in the optical band gap occurs in a dc \nbias window. This corresponds to the prediction of an op- \ntimal energy window for C ions to form diamond crystals \nin ion beam deposited films. It should be noted that our \nsystem is not an UHV ion beam system, but rather a \nplasma CVD system with ion acceleration across the \nsheath space. Hence the dc self-bias voltage is not a direct \nmeasure of ion energy due to the much higher pressure of \nthe system. However, the ion energies from the theoretical \ncalculations of Lifshitz et al. suggest that an optimum en- \nergy for Cf ions to nucleate as diamond is 50-100 eV. \nWith the particular conditions of pressure and temperature \nused in our experiments, it is possible that the equivalent \nC!+ ion energy range is obtained at the substrate with dc \nbias voltages around -265 V. The theory that at high dc \nbiases the film amorphizes the surface is reinforced by the \nincrease in the refractive index and the compressive stress \nin the tilms.8\u201923 Amorphization can be thought of as the \ncompaction of the deposited film due to the impact of high \nenergy ions. Therefore, the rise seen in the refractive index \nand the increase in compressive stress in the a-C\/diamond \nfilm, fits in well with the subplantation model proposed by \nThe optical properties of a-C\/diamond films deposited \nat room temperature from a CH4\/Ar plasma have been \nexamined in the IR-to-UV range. The results show that the \nhydrogen in the films is predominantly bonded to sp\u2019 C. \nThe optical band gap of the films is not directly related to \nthe hydrogen content, though the films with the highest \noptical band gaps tend to have a relatively low hydrogen \ncontent. The major parameter which controls the optical \nband gap is the dc self-bias voltage developed during dep- \nosition. The existence of a dc bias window which results in \nthe highest optical band gap is in accordance with the \ntheory of Lifshitz et al. which postulates the existence of an \noptimum energy window for C ions to crystallize as dia- \nmond in films deposited on low temperature substrates. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors wish to acknowledge the help received \nfrom X.
