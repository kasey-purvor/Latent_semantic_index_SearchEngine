DOI:10.1002\/qj.646\n1. The Tripleclouds scheme\nClouds are recognised as a major source of uncertainty\nin climate models (Randall, et al., 2007). It is therefore\nimperative that parametrizations of cloud properties\ndescribe the cloud and its processes as realistically as possible.\nHowever, most radiation schemes in general circulation\nmodels (GCMs) represent clouds as plane-parallel and align\nthem using maximum-random overlap, whereby vertically\ncontinuous clouds are overlapped maximally and clouds\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society\n1206 J. K. P. Shonk and R. J. Hogan\nseparated by layers of clear sky are overlapped randomly.\nThe use of these approximations causes large, systematic\nbiases in the radiative fluxes above and below the clouds\n(e.g. Barker, et al., 1999; Carlin, et al., 2002).\nShonk and Hogan (2008) introduced a new cloud\nrepresentation scheme, referred to as \u2018Tripleclouds\u2019, that\nimproves on the conventional plane-parallel cloud scheme\nby partitioning the cloud in each layer of a gridbox into two\nhomogeneous regions of equal fractional area. One of these\nregions contains the optically thinner half of the cloud in\nthat layer; the other contains the optically thicker half. A\nthird region contains the clear sky. The two values of water\ncontent for the cloudy regions are defined to approximately\nrepresent the standard deviation of water content in the\nlayer. In an operational GCM, the standard deviation could\neither be specified using an empirical value or, in some recent\nschemes, taken from an explicit representation of variance\n(e.g. Tompkins, 2002). A review of a number of studies by\nShonk, et al. (2010), hereafter \u2018Part I\u2019, sought to quantify this\nspread in terms of fractional standard deviation, defined as\nthe quotient of the standard deviation of water content and\nits mean:\nfw = \u03c3 w\nw\n. (1)\nWe found fw to be 0.75 \u00b1 0.18, with no systematic\ndependence on cloud type, observation type or gridbox\nsize. Tripleclouds was implemented in the Edwards\u2013Slingo\nradiation code (Edwards and Slingo, 1996), and tests using\nradar data scenes in Part I showed that significant additional\nbiases are not introduced into the radiation fields when\nusing this mean value, and a mean plane-parallel bias in\ncloud radiative forcing (CRF) of 8% could be reduced to less\nthan 1% using Tripleclouds.\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) proposed an overlap\nscheme that we refer to as \u2018exponential-random\u2019 overlap,\nwhere vertically continuous cloud is overlapped not\nmaximally or randomly, as in all previous schemes, but\naccording to an \u2018overlap parameter\u2019, \u03b1, whose value varies\nfrom zero for random overlap to one for maximum\noverlap. They found the value of \u03b1 to decay roughly\ninverse-exponentially with layer separation for layers within\nvertically continuous clouds, over a decorrelation scale\nof order 1.5 km for a midlatitude location. In Part I,\nwe combined this with results from the cloud radar\nmeasurements of Mace and Benson-Troth (2002) to derive\na simple latitudinal relationship for this decorrelation\nscale. We introduced a slightly different form of overlap\nparameter, \u03b2 , with a definition that allowed exponential-\nrandom overlap to be applied to three-region systems as well\nas two-region systems. We converted the \u03b1 decorrelation\nscales of Hogan and Illingworth (2000) and Mace and\nBenson-Troth (2002) to \u03b2 decorrelation scales and found\nthe best-fit latitude relationship to be:\nZ0\u03b2 = 2.174 \u2212 0.0207\u03c6 , (2)\nwhere Z0\u03b2 is decorrelation height in kilometres and \u03c6 is\nabsolute latitude in degrees. Seasonal effects were found to\ncause a variation of order \u00b10.5 km inZ0\u03b2 . For a three-region\nsystem with one clear-sky region and two cloudy regions, a\ndecorrelation height of Z0\u03b2 is applied to the clear-sky region\nonly and a height of Z0\u03b2\/2 is applied to the cloudy regions.\nThis choice is based on the results of Ra\u00a8isa\u00a8nen, et al. (2004),\nwithin the limitations discussed in Part I.\nIn this paper, we combine Tripleclouds with exponential-\nrandom overlap and apply it to the European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis\n(ERA-40) data to investigate the impact of cloud structure\non the global radiation budget for a realistic distribution of\nclouds. The individual radiative effects of the modification\nof horizontal inhomogeneity and vertical overlap are\ninvestigated and compared. The method used to investigate\nthese contributions is discussed in section 2. In section 3,\nthe radiation calculations are performed and the global\nradiation budget from our ERA-40 data compared with\nradiation budget measurements derived from the Clouds\nand the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project. The\nindividual effects of the horizontal and vertical components\nof the Tripleclouds scheme are considered, along with the\ntotal effects, in section 4, both in terms of radiation and\ncloud cover. Finally, the paper is concluded in section 5.\n2. Data and experimental method\nThe global data used in this investigation are extracted\nfrom the ERA-40 re-analysis dataset. Compiled by the\nECMWF (Uppala, et al., 2005), ERA-40 is a global dataset of\nmeteorological variables stored at six-hourly intervals over\nthe 45-year period from September 1957 to August 2002. Its\navailable cloud variables consist of separate fields of ice water\ncontent, liquid water content and cloud fraction. These are\ntaken directly from the model, with no assimilated cloud\nobservations, on a grid with resolution of 1.125\u25e6 \u00d7 1.125\u25e6.\nThis equates to a gridbox size of 110 km at the Equator and\nabout 60 km at midlatitudes (and a global average gridbox\nsize of order 85 km). The data are stored on 60 vertical levels,\nextending from the surface up to a pressure of 10 Pa.\nA single year of the ERA-40 dataset is used. As the variety\nand quality of data sources assimilated into the re-analysis\nincreases throughout the 45-year time period, we choose\n2001, the most recent full year available. From this year of\ndata, we extract January, April, July and October to give a\nsample of the weather in each season. This gives us a set\nof 480 scenes: four scenes for each of the first 30 days of\neach of the four months, at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC\neach day.\nHowever, using only four scenes per day for short-wave\nradiative transfer calculations leads to the complication that,\nfor any given location, the calculation is only performed with\nthe sun above the horizon at two solar zenith angles. This\ncould lead to systematic localised errors in flux calculations.\nIn the interests of minimising these systematic errors without\ndrastically increasing radiation calculation time, the choice\nis made to increase the number of scenes per day to eight,\ngiving a three-hour temporal resolution. This is achieved by\nrecalculating the radiative transfer for the same cloud fields,\nbut using a solar zenith angle field that has been advanced\nby three hours. In a simple, idealised test, this was seen to\nreduce local errors in cloud radiative forcing from up to\n20% to less than 5%.\nAs in Part I, the radiative transfer calculations are\nperformed using the Edwards\u2013Slingo radiation code\n(Edwards and Slingo, 1996). For all calculations, constant\neffective radius values of 30 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m are used for\nice particles and liquid droplets respectively. Ice particles\nare treated as spheres in the long-wave calculation; in the\nshort-wave, the parametrization of Kristja\u00b4nsson, et al. (2000)\nis employed.

The long-wave surface emissivity is set to\na constant global value of 0.98. We use well-mixed profiles\nof oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC-11\nand CFC-12, with mixing ratios that are typical, present-day\nvalues. A profile of ozone mass mixing ratio is taken from\nthe midlatitude summer atmosphere (McClatchey, et al.,\n1972). Water vapour distributions are derived from ERA-40;\naerosols are not used in the calculations. The calculations\ndivide the short-wave part of the spectrum into five bands\nand the long-wave part into nine bands.\nFour radiative transfer calculations are performed on\neach scene: a clear-sky calculation to enable calculation of\ncloud radiative forcing; a baseline calculation using plane-\nparallel clouds and maximum-random overlap (PPm); a\nfurther maximum-random overlap calculation but with\nTripleclouds applied (TCm); and a calculation with\nTripleclouds combined with exponential-random overlap\n(TCe). Tripleclouds is applied to each layer of each scene\nof ERA-40 data using the \u2018fractional standard deviation\nmethod\u2019: the pair of values of water content for Tripleclouds,\nwTC, is calculated from the single mean water content\nvalue stored in the dataset, w, using the fractional standard\ndeviation fw = 0.75 as determined in Part I via:\nwTC = w \u00b1 fww . (3)\nIn the event of mixed-phase clouds occurring, this equation\nis applied separately to the ice and liquid cloud water\ncontents. Exponential-random overlap is applied using the\nderived variation of the decorrelation height Z0\u03b2 with\nlatitude stated in (2). The cloud configurations used in\nthis experiment are shown by the schematics in Figure 1 for\na single pair of cloudy layers. For completeness, a schematic\nof exponential-random overlap with plane-parallel clouds\nis shown (PPe), although radiative calculations using this\nconfiguration are not performed.\nThe performance of the representations are compared in\nterms of improvements in TOA and surface cloud radiative\nforcing (CRF). As the changes in CRF are an attempt\nto offset the plane-parallel biases, we shall refer to them\nthroughout this study as \u2018shifts\u2019 as opposed to \u2018biases\u2019.

Note that the PPe configuration is shown here\nonly for completeness; it is not used in the experiment. The changes in\ncloud approximation that give the CRF \u2018shifts\u2019 (see text) are shown by the\narrows.\nand the improvement that is due to vertical overlap (the\n\u2018vertical shift\u2019) as the difference between the TCm and TCe\nresults. This choice results in the combined change in CRF\n(the \u2018total shift\u2019) then being equal to the sum of these two\nshifts, and also the difference between the PPm and TCe\nresults. The pairs of cloud approximations used to determine\nour CRF shifts are indicated by the arrows in Figure 1.\nWe also investigate the effects on radiation budget of the\nuncertainty in our horizontal and vertical cloud structure\nparametrizations by performing additional radiative transfer\ncalculations on a sample of the scenes. We perform extra\ncalculations using the TCm representation with fw = 0.57\nand fw = 0.93 (the upper and lower error bar values of fw\nidentified in Part I), so that we can generate error bars on our\nhorizontal shift by comparing PPm results with TCm+ and\nTCm\u2212 (Table I). The effect of vertical overlap uncertainty is\ninvestigated by applying fits of Z0\u03b2 for the upper and lower\nlimits of the error bars in Figure 4 of Part I. (The equations\nfor these fits are given in Table I.) Error bars in CRF are\nthen generated by comparing the unperturbed TCm CRFs\nwith those from TCe+ and TCe\u2212. The errors in total CRF\nare determined by adding the horizontal and vertical shift\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 136: 1205\u20131215 (2010)\n1208 J. K. P. Shonk and R. J. Hogan\nerrors in quadrature, using the assumption that they are\nindependent of each other.\n3. Global radiation budget\nThe first step of the experiment seeks to verify that the CRFs\ncalculated using the ERA-40 data in the Edwards\u2013Slingo\nradiation code are realistic by comparing them with\nmeasurements from the CERES project (Wielicki, et al.,\n1996). We calculate mean global distributions of TOA\nshort-wave and long-wave CRF over the four months of the\nERA-40 data using the original plane-parallel, maximum-\nrandom cloud scheme (PPm) and the new Tripleclouds\nscheme with exponential-random overlap (TCe). These\nmean CRFs are compared with mean TOA CRFs for the\nsame four months extracted from CERES data in Figure 2.\nFigures 2(a, b) show the CERES radiation budget, and\n(c, d, e, f) the differences between these and the CRFs\ncalculated from ERA-40. Zonal averages of the CRF\ndistributions used in Figure 2 are shown separately in\nFigure 3; the global mean CRFs are given in Table II.\nIt is seen that our calculated global average short-wave\nCRF using TCe agrees with the CERES value to within\n1 W m\u22122. Despite this, the local errors are large in places,\nwith a general tendency for our ERA-40 short-wave CRFs to\nbe too large in magnitude over the tropical ocean and too\nsmall in magnitude at higher latitudes. A similar result was\nfound by Allan, et al. (2004). They attributed the differences\nto issues with the occurrence of clouds in ERA-40, discussed\nby Chevallier, et al. (2001). The tendency for short-wave CRF\nbiases to be positive at mid-to-high latitudes and negative\nin the Tropics is also evident on Figure 3. The magnitudes\nand signs of these latitudinally averaged biases agree with\nthe results of Bender, et al. (2006), who compared radiation\nbudgets from a number of GCMs with observed budgets\nfrom CERES and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment\n(ERBE).\nGlobally, long-wave CRFs are found to be too low in\nmagnitude by about 7 W m\u22122 with respect to CERES. We\nclearly see this effect in the long-wave in Figure 3, with a\nbias of order 10 W m\u22122 in the midlatitudes. This difference\nis much larger than the changes in the ERA-40 radiation\nbudget made by applying Tripleclouds, and is partly due to\nthe fact that CERES clear-sky fluxes are only measured in\nlocations of clear sky.

In the long-\nwave, this deficit of water vapour is found to result in CERES\noutward clear-sky fluxes that are too large in regions of warm\nascent by up to 15 W m\u22122 (Allan and Ringer, 2003).\nSome local differences between the CRF fields are also\nseen over land surfaces in the tropics, particularly in the\nlong-wave. In the CERES data, there are patches of higher\nlong-wave CRF over northern South America and central\nAfrica, with values of over 60 W m\u22122. In the long-wave CRFs\ncalculated from ERA-40, values in these locations are lower\nby about 25 W m\u22122. This suggests fundamental differences\nin the clouds measured during CERES and the modelled\nclouds used in ERA-40, most notably the implication that\ndeep, tropical convection is poorly represented by the model,\nparticularly over land. Even so, a comparison of ECMWF\nmodel cloud output with radar data from three Cloudnet\nsites in Europe by Illingworth, et al. (2007) revealed a fair\nagreement in depictions of ice water content and liquid\nwater content. Also, Chevallier, et al. (2001) found both\nthe global distribution and seasonal cycle of cloud in\nthe ERA-40 dataset to be realistic, although with a few\nshortcomings identified. It should be re-emphasised that\nthe clouds present in ERA-40 are extracted directly from the\nECMWF model and constrained using data assimilation: no\ncloud observations were directly used in the dataset. This\nmeans that the clouds in ERA-40 take the same form as\nGCM clouds, which is ideal for our experiments. While we\naccept that there may be a few shortcomings in the ERA-40\ncloud fields with respect to reality, we shall make use of them\nfor this investigation.\n4. Global effect of cloud structure\nIn this section, we first consider changes in global cloud\ncover calculated from the ERA-40 data, averaged over the\nfour months (Figure 4). We then use the method discussed\nat length in section 2 to evaluate the changes to the global\nradiation budget caused by the individual implementation\nof Tripleclouds and exponential-random overlap, and also\ntheir combined effects. The global distributions of these CRF\nshifts are shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7. Each figure shows the\nmean distribution of short-wave, long-wave and net CRF\nshift averaged over the year. Global mean shifts, with error\nbars caused by the uncertainty in our parametrizations of fw\nand Z0\u03b2 , are given in Table III. The sizes of the error bars are\nstated as pairs of numbers, as the upper and lower bounds\nare found to not be equally spaced from the mean value.\nThe shifts are also shown averaged zonally in Figure 9, again\nwith error bars.\n4.1. Effect of vertical structure on cloud cover\nWe first consider the effects of our new vertical overlap\nscheme on global cloud cover, which is one of the most\nimportant mechanisms by which clouds affect radiation\nbudget (Slingo, 1990). Cloud cover is calculated for\neach ERA-40 scene using maximum-random, exponential-\nrandom and random overlap, then averaged to give a mean\nover the whole period. It is unimportant which horizontal\nstructure scheme is used as, by definition, the Tripleclouds\nscheme does not affect cloud fraction in individual layers\nand will have no effect on cloud cover.\nThe global distribution of cloud cover when maximum-\nrandom overlap is applied is presented in Figure 4(a); the\nincrease in cloud cover when exponential-random overlap\nis implemented is shown in Figure 4(b). High cloud cover\nis found in the storm tracks, where deep, structured cloud\nis often present. In these locations, we also find the largest\nshifts in cloud cover, up to an increase of 0.1. In the Tropics,\nthe prevalence of high-level convective anvils also give a\ncloud cover of near 1, although their lesser vertical extent\nleads to a much smaller vertical shift in cloud cover. The\neffect of using exponential-random overlap is to increase the\ncloud cover in all locations where clouds exist.\nA similar study of overlap on ECMWF model data was\nperformed by Morcrette and Jakob (2000). The global\ndistribution of cloud cover in our Figure 4 is similar to their\nFigure 3 and our vertical shifts between maximum-random\nand random overlap (not shown) similar to their Figure 4,\nalthough the sign of their shift is sometimes negative.

Cloud cover calculated from the year of ERA-40 data using different cloud overlap approximations. (a) shows the cloud cover when the\ncloud is overlapped using maximum-random overlap; (b) shows the shift in cloud cover introduced by replacing maximum-random overlap with\nexponential-random. The global effect of improving the overlap assumption is to increase the global mean cloud cover from 0.660 to 0.716.\nis because their study implemented the overlap schemes in\nthe radiation code and performed a short model integration\nusing the overlap scheme interactively. We find an increase\nin mean global cloud cover from 0.660 to 0.716 when\nexponential-random overlap is performed, and to 0.786\nwhen random overlap is performed. Our vertical shift to\nrandom overlap is greater in size than that of Morcrette\nand Jakob (2000), whose cloud cover rose from 0.639 to\n0.708. This difference is attributable to differences in vertical\nresolution: the ERA-40 grid has twice as many levels as\nthe grid used by Morcrette and Jakob (2000). For random\noverlap, the total cloud cover is strongly dependent on\nvertical resolution, with increasing resolution leading to\nmore tropospheric layers and a larger cloud cover.\n4.2. Effect of horizontal structure on top-of-atmosphere CRF\nFigure 5 shows the global effects of implementing\nTripleclouds. Using the plane-parallel approximation results\nin clouds that are too reflective in the short-wave and\ntoo emissive in the long-wave (e.g. Cahalan, et al., 1994;\nPomroy and Illingworth, 2000). In terms of CRF, this\nleads to a short-wave CRF that is too negative and a\nlong-wave CRF that is too positive. The horizontal CRF\nshift introduced by Tripleclouds acts in the opposite\ndirection to the plane-parallel biases in both spectral regions.\nHorizontal short-wave CRF shifts are found to be most\nsubstantial simply where clouds are present, with the largest\nshifts in the short-wave found off the western coasts of\nAfrica, North America and South America, where marine\nstratocumulus is dominant. This is unsurprising, as marine\nstratocumulus covers vast areas of ocean. They have a\nhigh cloud fraction and, on account of their midlatitude\nlocation, high insolation is implied, leading to a large\nradiative impact (Oreopoulos, et al., 2009). The long-wave\nhorizontal CRF shift of marine stratocumulus is found\nto be much smaller in magnitude. The largest long-wave\nhorizontal CRF shifts occur in the tropical western Pacific,\nwhere deep convection is prevalent. As the emission of long-\nwave radiation decreases with temperature, boundary-layer\nclouds have a much lower positive CRF than upper-\ntropospheric clouds, as their temperatures are much closer\nto that of the surface.\nThe magnitudes of the short-wave and long-wave CRF\nshifts are approximately equal in the tropical western Pacific,\nand hence the shift in net CRF in this location is found to be\nsmall. Elsewhere, the change in short-wave CRF dominates\nthe net CRF shift, with the largest shifts in the regions of\nmarine stratocumulus. The positive mean global short-wave\nshift of 6.15 W m\u22122 is found to be about three times greater\nin magnitude than the negative mean global long-wave\nshift of 2.02 W m\u22122. The short-wave shift is comparable\nin magnitude to the 4.2 W m\u22122 short-wave plane-parallel\nbias found by Oreopoulos, et al. (2009) in their analysis of\ncloud data from MODIS. The global mean net CRF shift\nis 4.13 W m\u22122, but with net shifts of up to 10 W m\u22122 that\ncould certainly have a sizeable radiative impact on a climate\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q.

This shows that\nthe uncertainty in our fw value can have significant impacts\non the magnitude of the horizontal shift.\n4.3. Effect of vertical structure on top-of-atmosphere CRF\nThe global distribution of vertical CRF shifts introduced\nby replacing maximum-random overlap with exponential-\nrandom overlap for a Tripleclouds representation is shown\nin Figure 6. Vertical shifts are found to be of opposite sign to\nhorizontal shifts, with the largest values found in the Tropics.\nThis is true for both the short-wave and long-wave, although\nthe long-wave shifts are again smaller in magnitude than\nthe short-wave shifts by around a factor of 2 (1.98 W m\u22122\nas opposed to 3.86 W m\u22122), resulting in a negative shift in\nnet CRF of magnitude 1.88 W m\u22122. While the areas of deep,\ntropical convection give large values of vertical short-wave\nand long-wave CRF shift, cancellation again occurs, leaving\na pattern of net vertical CRF shift that is fairly uniform.\nThese results show that overlap is most important in the\nareas of deep, tropical convection.

On account of the alternate signs\nof the two CRF shifts, the vertical CRF shift acts to offset\nthe horizontal CRF shift, in agreement with Hogan and\nKew (2005). Cancellation is not exact, however: in most\nlocations, the horizontal shifts are larger, but there are a few\nregions where vertical shifts dominate. For the regions of\nmarine stratocumulus, the horizontal shifts dominate in the\nshort-wave, giving an overall positive shift in net CRF. In\nthe areas of deep, tropical convection, however, the vertical\nshifts dominate, with total shifts of opposite sign in both\nthe long-wave and the short-wave. In terms of net CRF, the\nhorizontal shifts remain dominant in most locations.\nTable III shows that the global mean percentage CRF shift\nintroduced by the full scheme is of magnitude 2.29 W m\u22122\nin the short-wave and 0.04 W m\u22122 in the long-wave, again\nwith alternate sign.

This\nis particularly true in both spectral regions in areas of\nmarine stratocumulus, where overlap is largely irrelevant.\nIn the Tropics, however, the two effects are seen to\nbe of comparable size in the short-wave, implying the\napproximate cancellation of CRF shifts shown in the\nprevious section. In the long-wave, the vertical effects are\nseen to dominate, particularly in the Tropics, where deep\nconvection tends to occur.

The\nerror bars indicate the effects of the uncertainty in the Tripleclouds and\nexponential-random parametrization on the radiative transfer.\n(1999) to compare the effects of representing horizontal\ninhomogeneity and vertical overlap were generated using a\ncloud-resolving model and a scenario set up from scenes of\ntropical convection. For tropical clouds in our investigation,\nwe also find that the two components of cloud structure had\neffects of similar magnitude, indicating agreement between\nour results and those of Barker, et al. (1999).\nIt is apparent from the results of this section that either\nrepresenting horizontal inhomogeneity or improving the\noverlap scheme in a plane-parallel, maximum-random cloud\nscheme, without the other, is insufficient. Figure 9 implies\nclearly that fixing overlap alone in a PPm scheme would cause\nthe CRF biases to become larger, while fixing inhomogeneity\nalone changes the CRFs in the correct direction, but with an\novercompensation, resulting in a bias of the opposite sign\nand about half the magnitude. Hence, as both components\nof cloud structure have sizeable impacts on radiation budget,\nit is apparent that representing horizontal inhomogeneity\nand vertical overlap are equally important.\n4.5. Effect of structure on surface CRF\nThe distributions of surface CRF shifts (not shown) are\nsimilar to those at the TOA, with a few differences. In\nthe short-wave, the magnitudes of both the horizontal and\nvertical CRF shifts are larger at the surface by about 3 W m\u22122.\nThis results in a very small total short-wave shift of less than\n1 W m\u22122 when averaged globally.

The regions of high horizontal TOA CRF shift in the\nareas of deep, tropical convection are found to be absent\nat the surface. Instead, the highest regions of horizontal\nshift are at higher latitudes, most notably in the storm\ntracks and marine stratocumulus areas, where the CRF shift\nreaches 10 W m\u22122 in magnitude locally. The surface CRF of\na low-level cloud is much more positive than a high-level\ncloud, on account of its higher temperature. Therefore, any\nchanges affecting low-level clouds will have a much larger\nimpact on long-wave surface radiation budget than those\naffecting high clouds. Hence, the largest horizontal shifts\nare seen where inhomogeneous low clouds exist. Long-wave\nvertical CRF shifts are seen to be largest at the surface in\nlocations where clouds have low bases but have a larger\nvertical extent. This leads to sizeable shifts in the storm\ntracks, but markedly smaller shifts in the areas of deep,\ntropical convection.\nThe smaller magnitude of both the horizontal and vertical\nlong-wave CRF shift at the surface for areas of deep,\ntropical convection are found to combine to have little\neffect in the total shift patterns. The total net CRF shift\nat the surface is found to be similar to that at the top\nof the atmosphere, but with a reduction in shift in areas\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q. J.

Table III shows that, at the\nsurface, both the short-wave and long-wave total shifts are\nlarger in magnitude than at the TOA, but the net total shift\nis smaller.\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper, we have quantified the effect of cloud\nstructure on the global radiation budget, and also compared\nthe individual radiative effects of horizontal and vertical\ncloud structure representations. Three different cloud\nrepresentations were applied to a year of ERA-40 re-analysis\ndata and radiative transfer calculations performed using\nthe Edwards\u2013Slingo code. The radiative performance of\nthe cloud representations was evaluated in terms of cloud\nradiative forcing (CRF). First, the CRFs calculated using\n\u2018Tripleclouds\u2019 with \u2018exponential-random\u2019 overlap (TCe)\nand the plane-parallel, maximum-random scheme (PPm)\nwere compared with CRF data from the Clouds and the\nEarth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project to verify\nthat the calculated CRFs were realistic. Both patterns and\nmagnitudes of short-wave and long-wave CRFs were found\nto be comparable, although there were a few local and\nsystematic differences that were attributed to the difference\nbetween the modelled clouds from ERA-40 and the clouds\nobserved by satellite as part of CERES and the CERES\ndefinition of clear-sky fluxes.\nThe global radiative effects of introducing horizontal\ninhomogeneity (the \u2018horizontal shift\u2019) and of improving the\nrepresentation of vertical overlap (the \u2018vertical shift\u2019) were\nthen considered at the TOA. In the short-wave, horizontal\nCRF shifts were found to be largest in areas of marine\nstratocumulus, which cover large areas of the ocean and are\nradiatively important. Long-wave horizontal CRF shifts were\nfound to be largest in regions of deep, tropical convection,\nwhere the long-wave CRFs are largest on account of the\nheight of the clouds. These two shifts are of opposite sign,\nand it turns out that the two shifts cancel in the deep,\ntropical convection, giving a near-zero result. In areas of\nmarine stratocumulus, however, the horizontal shifts are still\nstrongly positive, with a global mean shift of 4.13 W m\u22122.\nVertical TOA CRF shifts were found to be of opposite\nsign to the horizontal CRF shifts and were largest in the\nshort-wave and long-wave where the prevalent clouds are\ntallest: namely, in areas of deep, tropical convection. In net\nCRF shift terms, however, these are found again to be of\nsimilar magnitude, with a small negative shift found in most\nlocations and a global mean vertical shift of \u20131.88 W m\u22122.\nThe combined effect of these two shifts is that they offset\neach another. The total net CRF shift is found to be near\nzero in deep, tropical convection, but sizeably positive in\nareas of marine stratocumulus. The global mean total net\nCRF shift was found to be 2.25 W m\u22122; which may not seem\na large effect, but it should be noted that the shifts of order\n10 W m\u22122 in marine stratocumulus areas could certainly\ncause impacts on cloud life cycles in climate simulations.\nInvestigations into the effect of the uncertainty in our\nparametrization on the horizontal and vertical shifts revealed\nthat the uncertainty in fractional standard deviation of water\ncontent fw has a much larger effect on the horizontal shifts\nthan the uncertainty in decorrelation height Z0\u03b2 has on the\nvertical shifts, with the spread in the total combined shift\nbeing dominated by the effect of the uncertainty in fw. This\nimplies that the crudeness of our linear latitude dependence\nof Z0\u03b2 , described in Part I, is not necessarily an issue, as the\nCRF shifts are relatively insensitive to its values. In contrast,\nhowever, it shows that the uncertainty in fw is much more\nimportant, and that more work is required to determine its\nvalues with greater accuracy.\nWhile the representation of horizontal inhomogeneity\nin a GCM may have a larger impact on the radiation\nbudget than improving the representation of vertical overlap,\nit turns out that both are important, as correcting one\nand not the other can increase the error in CRF. Fixing\nhorizontal inhomogeneity and not vertical overlap can\nresult in overcompensation, and fixing vertical overlap and\nnot horizontal inhomogeneity can result in biases of larger\nmagnitude. In other words, improving representations of\nboth horizontal inhomogeneity and vertical overlap are\nimperative to create improvements in radiation budget. We\nare currently implementing Tripleclouds and exponential-\nrandom overlap into the Met Office Unified Model to\nevaluate the performance of the two components in terms\nof their effects on future climate.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Richard Allan for assistance with the CERES\ndata and Paul Berrisford for support with ERA-40 data.\nAlso Keith Shine and Jean-Jacques Morcrette are thanked\nfor their thoughts and input.
