Introduction \n \nThe Clyde Estuary, (Scotland, UK) occupies a catchment that includes the major city \nof Glasgow as well as the outlying towns of Dumbarton, Clydebank, Renfrew, \nPaisley, Greenock and Port Glasgow. A settlement since the Bronze age, Glasgow\u2019s \nindustrial growth accelerated in the 18th and 19th C to such an extent that it was known \nas the second city of the British Empire. Notable Clydeside industries of the 19th and \n20th centuries included shipbuilding, textiles, chemical production as well as coal and \nironstone mining (Reed 1999). Today, the Clyde still builds military ships at Govan \nand Scoutstoun, however, manufacturing is now mainly linked to light as compared to \n 2 \nheavy industry. Consequently, the river Clyde which flows through Glasgow city has \nreceived pollution from the onset of the industrial revolution (ca 1770 AD) up to the \npresent day (Edgar et al. 2006; Vane et al. 2007a; Vane et al. 2010). \n \nThe environmental persistence of organic pollutant groups such as total petroleum \nhydrocarbons (TPH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychlorinated \nchlorinated biphenyls (PCB) ranges from hours to decades to centuries. When used in \ntogether non-volatile TPH and PAH compounds facilitate the reconstruction of \ndifferent phases of development based upon changing fuel sources and use of \nchemicals (Meyers 2003; Vane et al. 2007b; White et al. 2005). There are four broad \nsources of PAH namely, biogenic, geogenic, petrogenic and pyrolytic. These can be \ndistinguished using parent and alkylated PAH distributions as well as parent PAH \nisomeric ratios, which are controlled by the temperature and duration of formation \n(Yunker et al. 2002). In most industrially impacted environments petrogenic and \npyrolytic PAH sources predominate and these have different parent PAH distributions \nwhich permit sediments contaminated with crude oil and petrol to be distinguished \nfrom combustion sources such as coal burning and vehicular combustion emissions \n(Huntley et al. 1995; Iannuzzi et al. 2005; Vane et al. 2007a).  The known history of \ninitial production, peak production and banning of a particular group of \nenvironmentally persistent organic compounds, which have no known natural sources, \nsuch as PCB and or brominated flame retardants (PBDE) can be used to not only trace \nchanging industries but also potentially provide chronological information based upon \nvarying product formulation histories (Vane et al. 2010). In general, multiple analyses \nof anthropogenic organic chemicals are required to not only build a complete picture \nof urban \/industrial activities but also to avoid and account for the well known \ncomplicating effects of molecular diffusion, post-depositional transformation \nmediated by microbes, bioturbation and variable sediment accumulation rates. \n \nAlternative means of tracking human-induced environmental change in industrial \nestuaries include the use of heavy metal concentrations and isotope ratios e.g. Pb, and \n207\/206Pb as well as radioactive isotopes such as 137Cs (Fox et al. 1999; Plater et al. \n1998; Ridgway et al. 2003; Vane et al. 2009). In Britain, vegetation archives which \nmainly record atmospheric Pb pollution show that 207\/206Pb values remained at about \n0.85 through the 19th century and increased from 1920 due to the use of leaded petrol \nand overseas industrial lead (Bacon et al. 1996; Farmer et al. 2002).  Maximal \n207\/206Pb values of 0.89 are observed in the 1980\u2019s and then declined once leaded \npetrol was banned. These archives allow the construction of 207\/206Pb chronologies that \nmay be used in collaboration with conventional 210Pb dating, or instead when this \nproves problematic. \n \nIn this paper we present the results of chemical signatures in sediment cores from the \nClyde estuary of organic pollutants (PAH, PCB, TPH) and lead concentrations as well \nas 207\/206Pb isotope ratios. The principal aim was to establish whether sediment \ncontamination profiles could be used to identify the late Anthropocene and track \nchanging industrial activities and increasing urbanisation of the Clyde estuary.  \n \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n \n2.1 Sampling and sample preparation \n 3 \n \nSeven sediment cores collected in duplicate (A & B) in June 2004 and April 2006  \n(Fig. 1). Sampling sites in the estuary were accessed by a Griffon 2000TD hovercraft \nin 2004 and on foot in 2006 using pre-determined GPS co-ordinates to accurately \nlocate each position. Clear polycarbonate tubes were manually driven into the \nexposed sediment and extracted to recover the core material. The BGS core codes \nwere 55\/-05\/04-06-15 (station 1), 55\/-05\/700 (Station 2), 55\/-05\/04-06-12 (Station 3), \n55\/-05\/718 (Station 4), 55\/-05\/712 (Station 5) and 55\/-05\/702 (Station 6), 55\/-05\/714 \n(station 7). Upon return to the laboratory each core was cut in half and sub-sampled. \nSediments for organic analyses were freeze-dried and prepared as reported in Vane et \nal. 2009. Sub-samples for lead analysis were similarly freeze dried and ground to a \nfine powder in agate to minimise contamination. \n \n2.2 Total organic carbon and non-volatile hydrocarbons \n \nTotal organic carbon (TOC) content was determined using an Elementar VarioMax C, \nN analyser after acidification with HCl (50 % v\/v) to remove carbonate. The limits of \nquantification reported for a typical 300mg sample were 0.18%. Non-volatile \nhydrocarbons (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH)) were determined as reported in \nVane et al., (2009). Briefly sediments were extracted with, dichloromethane (DCM) \/ \nacetone (1:1 v\/v) mixture using an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE 200 Dionex) \nsystem. Saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined using by an Iatroscan \nMk6s instrument fitted with a flame ionization detector (FID). \n \n2.3 Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) \n  \nThe method used to extract and determine PCB congeners was based on that \ndescribed in Vane et al., 2007a. In summary, sediments were extracted with \nhexane\/acetone (1:1v\/v) in an ASE 200 (Dionex) and washed with conc. H2SO4. PCB \ncongeners were separated from other compound classes using a florsil\/sodium \nsulphate column and the n-hexane eluent subject to liquid-liquid extraction using \ndimethylsulphoxide (2 \u00d7 12 ml) and de-ionised water (25 ml) prior to extraction with \nn-hexane. The n-hexane extracts volume was reduced to 5 ml, passed through  \nanhydrous sodium sulphate (1g) and reduced to 100 \u00b5l. Combined gas \nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed on a Carlo Erba Mega \n500 series GC directly coupled to a Varian 1200L triple quadropole mass \nspectrometer.  \n \n2.4 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \n \nSediments (5g) were extracted with 25 ml of a 1:1 v\/v mix of acetonitrile and \ntetrahydrofuran (THF) in a ultrasonic bath (Camlab, 300W) for 45 minutes at 50\u00b0C. \nSamples were stored in the dark (2 h), to permit some clarification of the \nsupernantant, before taking a 2 ml aliquot and filtering with a  0.2 \u00b5m in-line syringe \nfilter (25 mm dia. - Nylon 66). Filtered sample extracts were injected into the HPLC \nsystem (Waters 600E) via a 5 \u03bcl sample loop (Rheodyne). Separation of 17 PAHs was \nachieved within 40 mins by gradient programming the eluent. PAH detection was \naccomplished employing a scanning fluorescence detector (Waters 474). The \n 4 \nfollowing PAH abbreviations are used throughout: Naph=naphthalene; Ace= \nacenaphthene; Fluor=fluorine; Phen=phenanthrene; Anth=anthracene; \nFanth=fluoranthene; Pyr=pyrene; B[a]A=benz[a]anthracene; Chrys=chrysene;    \nB[b]F= benzo[b]fluoranthene; B[k]F=benzo[k]fluoranthene; B[a]P=benz[a]pyrene; \nDBA=dibenz[a,h]anthracene; B[ghi]P=benzo[g,h,i]perylene; IP=Indeno[1,2,3-\nc,d]pyrene.  \n \n2.5. Total lead concentrations and lead isotope ratio determinations \n \nFor each sample, 0.25 g of powdered sediment was dissolved by a HF\/HClO4\/HNO3 \nmixed concentrated acid attack in Savillex\u2122 PFA vials. Once taken to dryness the \nsample material was redissolved in 2mls of 1M HBr. The Pb was separated using an \nanion exchange chromatography column (Dowex AG1-X8 resin) pre-cleaned and \nconditioned with 1M HBr. The separated lead was dried to remove the acid and the \ntest portion redissolved in 1% HNO3. On the day of analysis samples were diluted \nusing 1% HNO3 and spiked with thallium. Pb and isotope ratio determinations were \nmade using a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument (Thermo PQ ExCell) fitted with either a \nconventional glass concentric nebuliser or a Cetac Aridus 2 desolvating nebuliser \nsystem. The 2sd precision for the BCR-2 reference material, which has a total lead \nconcentration of 11 mg\/kg was 207\/206Pb = 0.0012, 208\/206Pb = 0.0042, based on n=5 \nreplicates. The BCR-2 reference material is a basalt rock from the Columbia River  \nand was produced and certified by the U.S. Geological Survey. This was chosen as the \nBGS long-term quality control for lead isotope ratio analysis as it has proved to be \none of the few geological\/environmental materials that is highly homogeneous with \nmodern reliable certificated isotope values at background lead concentrations. Data \n(raw isotope intensity count rates) were processed off-line using Microsoft Excel \nspreadsheets. The processing consisted of: (i) removal of background including 204Hg+ \ninterference on 204Pb+ in proportion to 202Hg+ response; (ii) calculation of isotope \nratios; (iii) determination of mass bias correction factor from defined isotope ratios of \nthallium (de Laeter et al. 2009) or SRM981(Thirlwell 2002); (iv) application of mass \nbias factors derived from SRM981 using external standard -sample-standard \nbracketing; (v) optional further internal mass bias correction using 205\/203Tl ratio. \nDuring the current study the use of Tl as an internal measure of mass bias was not \nfound to be necessary and external correction based on SRM981 was used. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1 Lead concentrations \n \nTotal lead and lead isotope ratio determinations were made on depth increments from \n7 cores (Station numbers: 1B, 2A, 4A, 4B, 5A, 6A, 7A) with two cores (4A & 4B) \nbeing duplicates but with 4B having a greater resolution of depth increments (Fig. 2). \nThe cores varied significantly in concentration ranges with Station 7A being the least \ncontaminated (6-24 mg\/kg) and Station 1B being the most contaminated (26-631 \nmg\/kg). The range of concentration values for the duplicate cores at Station 4 (360-35 \n& 377-23 mg\/kg) are in excellent agreement considering the choice of different depth \nincrements. The general trend was for both the maximum and minimum \nconcentrations to decrease from the inner to the outer estuary. The median values also \nfollow this trend with the exception that the mid-channel cores at Station 4 were \n 5 \nanomalously high. The median rather than the mean was chosen to report due to the \nnon-normal data distribution. \n \nIf the median concentration Pb (63 mg\/kg) for all the cores is compared against mean \ndata for other UK river estuaries, as summarised in Spencer (2002), it is found to be \nless than the Humber (127) and  Forth (89), similar to the Medway (67) and Thames \n(63) but greater than the Solway (25) and the estimated natural background (20). This \nsuggests the Clyde sediments are typical of a river that has flowed through the \nindustrial heart of an urban conurbation. \n \nIf the logs of Pb concentration versus depth are considered (Fig. 2), the cores split into \ntwo groups: (i) Cores 2A, 5A, 6A and 7A that appear to have base-line concentrations \nin the deeper sections with a discrete rise between 28-40cms down and then peak in \nconcentration between 18-28cms; (ii) cores 1B and 4B for which even the basal \nmeasurements at 90-100cms may not be background and peak in concentration \nbetween 39-74 cms beneath the surface. These results suggest either the second group \nhave a much higher sedimentation rate or the first group were subject to sediment \nerosion events or the Pb in the second group was more mobile and moved down core.  \n \n3.2 Lead isotope ratio determinations \nA number of lead isotope ratios were determined 206\/204Pb, 207\/204Pb, 208\/204Pb and \n207\/206Pb, 208\/206Pb. The ratios to 204Pb were not found to be useful due to the poorer \nprecision in measuring this isotope by quadrupole ICP-MS. However, significant \nvariation was found in the 207\/206Pb and 208\/206Pb ratios with ranges from 0.8382-\n0.8764 and 2.078-2.124 respectively with typical uncertainties of 0.0012 and 0.0042 \non individual determinations. The range of 207\/206Pb and 208\/206Pb ratios for depth \nincrements from all cores is plotted in Figure 3. The data tend to fall along a linear \narray with tighter adherence for the greater ratios and a greater spread at the smaller \nratios, indicative of one lead source with high values for both 207\/206Pb and 208\/206Pb \nratios and two or more sources with lower but different 207\/206Pb and 208\/206Pb ratios. \nFor comparison, potential mixing end-members have been plotted, these include \ngalena (PbS) ores from northern England and Scotland (Barreiro 1995; Barreiro & \nSpiro 1997; Parnell & Swainbank 1984) and aerosols from the Isle of Man-Liverpool \n(Charlesworth et al. 2006) and London (Noble et al. 2008) believed themselves to \nrepresent a mixture of petrol and industrial lead in airborne particles (Farmer et al, \n2002). The anomalously high 207\/206Pb ratio of UK petrol lead compared to UK \nore\/coal lead, was the result of it being primarily derived from Broken Hill in \nAustralia, and other non-UK sources (Sugden et al. 1993). Farmer et al. 2000 \nrecording a mean value of 207\/206Pb ratio of 0.9294 (+\/- 00095; 1sd n=33) between \n1989 and 1998. The diagram suggests mixing of the aerosol composition, with ore \nlead from either local natural or industrial sources and a more thoriogenic (208Pb) lead \nprobably from natural background rocks. The \u201caerosol\u201d signature may have resulted \nfrom some or all of the following: (i) direct input of airborne particulate material to \nthe Clyde and tributaries; (ii) input and dissolution of airborne particulate material to \nthe Clyde and tributaries or (iii) aqueous or particulate discharge from industrial-\nurban sources that equate to the averaging effect of an aerosol. As noted by Ellam \n(2010), there are certain deficiencies in such a diagram in terms of discriminating \nmore than two lead isotope sources and the use of 204Pb ratios would be preferable. \n 6 \nHowever, the extra analytical overhead of such measurements would not have been \nviable for the current study. \n \nWhen the 207\/206Pb isotope ratio is considered with respect to Pb concentration (Fig. 4) \na complex but explainable picture emerges. Four of the cores (2A, 5A, 6A and 7A) \nhave their lowest concentrations when 207\/206Pb is less than 0.850, that may be taken as \na pre-petrol lead industrial signature (Farmer et al. 2002; Weiss et al. 2002) and it is \nassumed these are representative of the geogenic background lead from the Clyde \ncatchment. The five cores closest in to Glasgow (1A, 2A, 4A, 4B and 5A) have \nisotope signatures of 0.8521-0.8591 at their maximum lead concentration; therefore \nthey are dominated by local lead ore, with reference to ratios of 0.8511-0.8540 from \nWanlockhead (Sugden et al. 1993) and the early industrial aerosol signature of 0.850. \nThis early industrial signal resulted from both lead smelting and coal burning; Farmer \net al, (1999) having estimated the contribution of lead from coal to depositional flux \nas being 15% in 1830, 36% in 1887 and 59% between 1913-1930.  For these more \ncontaminated cores their maximum  207\/206Pb isotope ratios (0.8638-0.8674) are \nindicative of a significant proportion of petrol lead input or modern industrial lead \nfrom a non-UK Broken Hill type deposit (Sugden et al. 1993) and are associated with \nan intermediate to high concentrations of lead with reference to their maximum \nconcentration. For cores 6A and 7A, those furthest from Glasgow, the highest \nconcentrations are associated with their peak 207\/206Pb ratios suggesting the most \nsignificant proportion of the lead input is from petrol or modern industrial lead (non-\nUK Broken Hill type deposit). The changing nature of the 207\/206Pb isotopic signals \nwith time and deposition is seen in Figure 2 where a common overall pattern emerges: \na lower isotope ratio deeper in the cores, which then rapidly rises to a higher value \nand in most cases turns over and decreases in the top few centimetres of the core. \n \n3.3 Towards a lead contaminant chronology for Clyde core material \n \nThere are a number of sources of information on long term changes of lead \nconcentration and lead isotope ratios of contaminant inputs to the environment over \ntime. These Scottish or UK sources primarily record atmospheric aerial deposition \nand include peat cores (Cloy et al. 2008; Weiss et al. 2002), lake sediment cores \n(Eades et al. 2002), vegetation, such as tree bark (Patrick and Farmer, 2007), moss \n(Farmer et al. 2002) and grass (Bacon et al. 1996). The major issues with peat or lake \ncores include collection from sites remote from the Clyde and accurate dating of \nlayers. The dating of these cores has been almost exclusively by 210Pb, as a \nradiometric technique it should give an absolute age but due to the necessity of \nmodelling the rate of 210Pb atmospheric input and assumptions therein, a greater level \nof uncertainty arises. However, in Scotland a unique record is available spanning \nnearly 200 years; Sphagnum moss has been collected across Scotland on known dates \nand archived at the Herbarium Collection of the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh \nfrom 1838 till present. This archive was analysed for lead concentrations and isotope \nratios, on a decadal basis by Farmer et al, 2002. Key dating observations on this data \ninclude a static trend in the 19th century through until ~1915 in the 207\/206Pb isotope \nratio (0.853) when the ratio starts to dramatically increase with the use of leaded \npetrol and overseas industrial lead. The ratio peaked in the 1980s (0.893) and has \nsince declined significantly. This peak and decline are commensurate with maximum \npetrol emissions in 1976 and reductions in lead in petrol in 1981, 1986 and its phasing \nout in 2000. This data set is generally consistent with that of Bacon et al, 1996 for \n 7 \ngrass collected annually since 1860, at Rothamsted in the south of England, and \nanalysed on a half-decadal basis. This study also observed a constant 207\/206Pb isotope \nratio (0.855) but only until approximately 1880 before rising and peaking between \n1980-1985 at 0.911. Bacon et al. (1996) noted that the initial rise in ratio was well in \nadvance of the introduction of tetra-ethyl lead in petrol and an additional anomalously \nhigh ratio between 1945-1950 suggests short as well as long term changes in the use \nof overseas lead in industry. The data from Farmer et al (2002) and the other sources \nhas been synthesised in Fig. 5 to give a lead isotope chronology. To this, data from \nCore 4B has been overlain; this core was chosen for having the best detail over a long \ntime period. The current data was linearly scaled to give the best visual fit to the data \nfrom Farmer et al. (2002). The concurrence although not perfect suggests that in this \ncore at least, the lead isotope ratios reflect those found from aerial deposition, that \nthere is no apparent removal of core material and the deposition rate must have been \nrelatively constant; therefore, in the absence of 137Cs or 210Pb data and accepting the \npossibility that due to contributions from rivers, streams or runoff there may be some \ndelayed input, chronologies are feasible.  \n \nFrom this conclusion two key time periods have been added to Figure 2, the period \n1835-1915 when the  207\/206Pb isotope ratio was static and 1980-1985 when the \nisotope ratio peaked. Any deep core values lower than the static value are assumed to \nrepresent a pre-Industrial Revolution (pre-IR = pre-1750) signal. The following \nspecific observations were made for individual cores.  \n \nCore 1B: The time period 1980-1985 equates to a depth of 40cms; 1915 at a depth of \n75 cms, which also appears to be the period of maximum lead concentration and the \ndeepest parts of the core have an early-industrial plateau and do not reach pre-IR \nisotope signatures or concentrations.  \n \nCore 2A: The time period 1980-1985 equates to a depth of 5-10cms; 1915 at a depth \nof 32 cm, which is just before the period of maximum lead concentration and the \ndeeper parts of the core values reach pre-IR (> 40cms); the lack of an early-industrial \nplateau suggests either a very slow deposition rate in this period or removal of such \nmaterial by erosion. The background lead concentration is reached at a depth of \n50cms. \n \nCore 4B: The time period 1980-1985 equates to a depth of 5-10cms; 1915 at a depth \nof 40 cm, which is coincident with the period of maximum lead concentration and the \ndeepest parts of the core have an early-industrial plateau and do not reach pre-IR \nisotope signatures or concentrations. The background lead concentration is not \nreached at the bottom of the core. \n \nCore 5A: The 207\/206Pb isotope ratio never peaks or reaches the same values as the \nother cores suggesting recent erosion of the surface layers; the 1915 marker occurs at \na depth of 40 cm, which is not coincident with the period of maximum lead \nconcentration which occurs at a younger depth of 20cms; an early-industrial plateau is \nobserved between 50-80 cm whilst a pre-IR isotope signature occurs at the deepest \npart of the core (90 cm). The background lead concentration is reached at a depth of \n40cm. \n \n 8 \nCore 6A: The time period 1980-1985 equates to a depth of 18cms, which matches the \nperiod of maximum lead concentration; 1915 at a depth of 43 cms, and the deeper \nparts of the core reach and plateau pre-IR (> 50cms); the lack of a early-industrial \nplateau, the maximum lead concentration being associated with the peak isotope ratio \n(1980-1985) imply this site was little impacted by industrial lead but probably \ndominated by petrol lead as might be expected further away from Glasgow centre. \nThe background lead concentration is reached at a depth of 45cms. \n \nCore 7A: The time period 1980-1985 equates to a depth of 10-20cms and just after the \nmaximum lead concentration; 1915 is at a depth of approximately 55 cm; there is no \nfirm early-industrial plateau but 1835-1915 occurs between 55-80cm whilst below 80 \nis pre-IR. The very low maximum lead concentration being associated with the peak \nisotope ratio (1980-1985) imply this site being little impacted by industrial lead but \nprobably influenced by petrol lead as might be expected for further away from \nGlasgow centre. The background lead concentration is reached at a depth of 45cm. \nIn summary, the cores provide a range of lead concentrations and 207\/206Pb isotope \nratios reflecting a contaminant chronology back to the pre Industrial Revolution \nperiod. In most cases the last century is covered by the top 40cms of the cores. \nHowever, Core 1B from the inner-most estuary site, has the most expanded recent \nsection, with the last century being represented by 70cm and the period from 1980-\n1985 onwards being 40cm. Perhaps of further note is the validity of comparing the \naerosol input to Sphagnum moss with the water-sediment information from the Clyde. \nA comparison of the mass of Pb emitted by road traffic in the UK (NAEI & 2009) and \nthe Pb concentration in Clyde water (SEPA 2009) for the period 1980-present showed \nremarkably good correlation, strongly supporting the use of the moss data of Farmer \net al, 2002, at least for the most recent period. \n \n3.4  Variation in non-volatile hydrocarbons \n \nThe TPH profiles 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A and 6A clearly show the on-set, rise and decrease \nin non-volatile hydrocarbon pollution in the Clyde (Fig. 6). Comparison of the TPH to \nPAH profiles revealed that peak TPH concentrations occurred a shallower depths than \nthe total PAH reflecting the earlier use of coal and later use of oil as an energy\/fuel \nsource. The decrease in TPH concentrations in the uppermost 10cm of stations 2A, \n3A, 4A, 5A, 6A is commensurate with both a decrease in industrial activities as well \nas increased environmental legislation and awareness from the 1980\u2019s to present (Fig. \n6). Using the 207\/206Pb chronology to define an approximate date of 1915 it is clear that \nthe on-set of environmentally significant concentrations of TPH did not occur until \nafter this date as shown at stations 1A, 4A, 5A and 6A. Comparison of the seven TPH \ndepth profiles revealed that for 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A and 6A TPH concentrations were \nhighest in the uppermost 30 cm whereas core 7A showed no systematic change in \nTPH concentrations (Fig. 6). In contrast station 1A recovered from the innermost \nportion of the study area showed the highest TPH values between 40-60 cm below \nsurface (4386-2838 mg\/kg) (Fig. 1 & 6). Unpolluted estuarine and coastal sediments \nhave reported TPH concentrations of 2-10 mg\/kg and this value may increase up to \nabout 100 mg\/kg in organic rich sediments which contain high concentrations of \nbiogenically sourced n-alkanes derived in part from plant waxes (Readman et al. \n2002; Vane et al. 2008; Volkman & Nichols 1991). Based on these criteria it appears \nthat the entire length of core 1A is contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons and \nthat the 10-~30 cm depth interval of cores 2A, 3A, 4A and 6A are also contaminated \n 9 \nwhereas the TPH concentrations in cores 7A and 5A are indicative of the low \nconcentrations sourced from natural biogenic organic matter.  \n \n3.5  Polychlorinated biphenyl contamination  \n \nInspection of the total PCB concentration profiles showed that contamination was \nmainly restricted to the top (0 to \u223c20 cm) of each core (Fig. 6). Total PCB content \nranged from <4.3 to 5797 \u00b5g\/kg, these values are considerably higher than those \nobserved in surface sediments from the inner Clyde reported at 5.2 to 129.9 \u00b5g\/kg, the \nMersey Estuary 36 to 1409 \u00b5g\/kg and pristine coastal sites in the USA (Vane et al. \n2007a; Vane et al. 2008).  This near surface increase in PCB contamination was \nwidespread throughout the study area, but was observed at greater depth at station 1A \n(Fig. 6). Maximum PCB concentrations at station 1A of  1217 \u00b5g\/kg were observed in \nthe middle portion of the sediment core (39-58 cm) these values thereafter decreased \nto the limit of quantification (<4.3 mg\/kg) at the base of the core.  The difference in \nPCB profiles at 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A and 6A as compared to 1A is best explained by \ndiffering sediment accumulation rates in the different parts of the estuary. Low \nconcentrations of PCB were detected throughout the entire length of core 4A which \nwas conferred a date of ~1830 on the basis of Pb207\/206 at 90 cm. In light that PCBs \nwere not commercially produced until 1929 it is reasonable to assume that the low but \nnevertheless quantifiable concentrations of PCB were due to down-profile mixing and \nor diffusion.   \n \nComparison of the summed tri, tetra, penta, hexa and hepta PCB homologue groups \nprofiles for 1A and 4A varied with increasing depth from surface (Fig. 7). Site 1A was \nmainly comprised of hexa and penta chlorinated homologues as was the upper portion \n(0-15 cm) of core 4A. At depths greater than and equal to 20 cm the dominant \nhomologue group at site 4A switched to trichlorobiphenyls. One plausible explanation \nfor the change in homologue distributions at site 4A could be that the industrial \nsource(s) of PCB pollution changed. For example, use of PCBs in transformers \nmainly utilised Aroclor 1254 (54% Cl) which is virtually devoid of trichchloroinated \nbiphenyl where as carbonless paper production used Aroclor 1242 (42 % Cl) which is \ndominated by trichlorinated homologues (Frame et al. 1996).  Alternatively \ndechlorination of highly chlorinated homologues to less chlorinated homologues has \nbeen observed in aerobic and anaerobic sediments (Borja et al. 2005). Therefore, it is \nalso possible that the increase in trichlorinated homologues and relative decrease in \nhexachlorinated congeners observed in this study is due to biodegradation in the \nsubsurface (Fig. 7).     \n  \nPrevious studies of dated sediment cores demonstrated that PCBs were introduced via \nenvironmental processes before the onset of production in the UK (1954) and that \nsedimentary storage reached a maximum in the mid to late 1960\u2019s, then gradually \ndeclined after the sales ban in 1977 (Alcock et al. 1993; Fox et al. 1999; Harrad et al. \n1994; Sanders et al. 1995). In the current study elevated total PCB concentrations \nwere observed at stations 2A, 3A, 4A and 6A the peak may therefore correspond to an \napproximate date of 1965 to about 1977 and notwithstanding down-core diffusion \nprocesses the initial rise in PCB concentrations above the limit of quantification \n(LOQ) are unlikely to predate the first world-wide commercial production in 1929.  \n \n3.6 PAH concentrations and isomer ratios \n 10 \n \nTotal PAH concentration profiles showed a much longer history of industrial activity \nthan either TPH or PCB compounds (Fig. 6). All of the cores gave significant \namounts of PAH contamination at depths greater than the 1915 level based on the \n207\/206Pb isotope marker, with the exception of station 6A. This finding was not \nunexpected given that coal, a common source of PAH, was mined in Lanarkshire, \nburnt by local industry and transported from the Clyde from 1800\u2019s. The total PAH \nprofile at station 1A revealed moderate values ranging from 216 \u00b5g\/kg at a depth of \n27 cm to a maximum of 16163 \u00b5g\/kg at 57 cm before decreasing to 5869 \u00b5g\/kg at the \nbase of the core (Fig. 6a). Other stations also showed elevated total PAH \nconcentrations, for example site 3A gave values up to 15745 \u00b5g\/kg at 8 cm beneath \nthe surface. Recent studies of surface sediments from the inner Clyde estuary reported \ntotal PAH concentrations in the ranges 630 \u00b5g\/kg to 23,711 \u00b5g\/kg (Vane et al. 2007a) \nand 450 \u00b5g\/kg to 28321 \u00b5g\/kg (Rogers 2002) which broadly concur with those \npresented in the current study. \n \nIn an attempt to gain insights into the sources of the PAHs in the sediments, isomeric \nratios were investigated.  This diagnostic approach, based essentially on the relative \nthermodynamic stability of isomeric pairs of PAHs, has been comprehensively \nreviewed and refined (Yunker et al. 2002). The resulting isomeric cross plotting, \nadopted from that of Yunker et al., is presented in Fig. 8 and employed four sets of \nisomeric ratios: \n \n1). Anth:Phen  =  [Anth]\/([Anth] + [Phen]) 2). Fanth:Pyr = [Fanth]\/([Fanth] + [Pyr])  \n \n3). BaA:Chrys  =  [BaA]\/([BaA] + [Chrys])  4). IP:BghiP  = [IP]\/([IP] + [BghiP]) \n   \nThe majority of points tended to occupy portions of the charts denoting petroleum and \ncombustion (specifically petroleum combustion) with comparatively few occupying \nthe grass\/wood\/coal combustion portions.  However, it should not necessarily be \ninferred that grass\/wood\/coal combustion made no significant contribution.  For \ninstance, in a situation in which both substantial petroleum PAH and grass\/wood\/coal \nPAH occur, the resulting isomeric ratios would display values intermediate between \npetroleum and grass\/wood\/coal combustion, i.e. they would mainly plot in the \npetroleum combustion chart regions. Therefore, some caution needs to be exercised in \nascribing PAH origins on the basis of isomeric ratios and these need to be considered \nin concert with other factors.   \n \nCore 4A: All of the points plot within the combustion\/petroleum combustion portions. \nThis would seem to imply that throughout its depth this core has received PAHs that \nhave emanated from similar or the same sources.  However, the caveat above should \nbe borne in mind. The other cores have points that plot across the various graphical \nsections suggesting diverse PAH inputs over the period in which the core sediments \nhave accumulated. In seeking to clarify the effect of the various inputs of PAHs to the \ncores, plots of isomeric ratios against depths were constructed (Figs. 9a & 9b).  For all \nthe ratios employed, a rise in their value indicated an increase in pyrolitic character \nand, conversely, a decrease in petrogenic character.   \n \n 11 \nCore 1A: This core, in contrast to all the others, exhibited, from the surface to a depth \nof 40 cm, comparatively low levels of TOC, TPH, PAH and PCB all of which rose to \nmaxima at greater depths (Fig. 6a & 6b).  From total concentration and isotopic ratios \n(207\/206Pb) of lead it was possible to ascribe tentatively a date of 1986 to the sediment \nat 40 cm.  Such a marked degree of deposition over the past 18 years (ca. 1986 to \n2004) was not evident in any of the other cores.  From 40 cm to the surface the \nisomeric ratios (Fig. 9) appeared to decrease as the total PAH concentration declined \nfrom 4189 \u00b5g\/kg to 348 \u00b5g\/kg. This ratio-decrease implied an increasing petroleum \ncontribution over the 18 year period and this correlated with an increase in the \n[BghiP]\/[BaP] ratio (Fig. 10) - a parameter taken to be characteristic of road traffic \nsources when its value exceeds 3.14 (Creaser et al. 2007).  It can be seen that from 40 \ncm upwards its value rose dramatically from 1.0 to reach 9.2 at the surface.  None of \nthe other cores exhibited [BghiP]\/[BaP] ratios of this magnitude (for all other cores \nthe ratio was always <3, ranging between 0.6 to 2.8 with an average of 1.2).  \nProbably, this late, substantial and rapid deposition of relatively uncontaminated \nsediment had arisen from a number of recent flood events. Were flooding responsible, \nthen it is likely that surface material contaminated by aerial deposition and run-off \nPAHs from the busy nearby A82 primary-route dual carriageway would form the bulk \nof the deposited sediment offering a valid explanation of the above observations. \n  \nThe beginning of a marked increase in PCB concentration probably signified the start \nof extensive PCB use and conferred a date of ca. 1950 on sediment at a depth of 57 \ncm.  This depth also coincided with maximum total PAH concentration.  There was a \nsteady decline in total PAH concentration to a depth of 87 cm.  Isotopic ratios \n(207\/206Pb) indicated that sediment at a depth of 75 cm probably dated from ca. 1915.  \nAccordingly, from pre-1915 to ca. 1950 there was a considerable and increasing input \nof PAHs to the sediments. The increase in total PAH concentrations and their mixed \ninput signatures (divergent isomeric ratios) corresponded well with dates for the \nzenith of Clydeside industry, particularly shipbuilding activity.   \n \nBetween ca. 1950 and ca. 1986, i.e. between core depths of 40 cm and 57 cm \nrespectively, total PAH concentration fell from a maximum 16163 \u00b5g\/kg to 4189 \n\u00b5g\/kg coinciding with the decline of the shipbuilding industry (Fig. 6).  Some \naugmentation from road traffic sources was indicated by the rise in the [BghiP]\/[BaP] \nratio from 1.6 at 57 cm to 4.6 at 48 cm and 4.2 at 43 cm (Fig. 10).  Meanwhile, the \nFanth:Pyr ratio trended downwards, likewise suggesting a shift to more \npetroleum\/petroleum combustion-derived PAH contributions.  This was not reflected \nin the other three isomeric ratios however.  The maximum in TPH concentration also \noccurred during this period and probably represents the compound influence of \nincreasing road traffic and fuel and oil discharges\/spills from local industry. \n         \nCore 2A: From examination of total concentration and isotopic ratios (207\/206Pb) of \nlead for this core an approximate date of 1915 may be attributed to sediment at a \ndepth of 40 cm.  Below 40 cm the total PAH concentration remained fairly constant \nand within the range 954 \u00b5g\/kg to 2435 \u00b5g\/kg (Fig. 6a).   Up to 40 cm the isomeric \nratios Anth:Phen, BaA:Chrys and IP:BghiP (if the point at 60 cm is ignored) \ndisplayed a gradual increase but this was not imitated by the Fanth:Pyr ratio which \nshowed a gradual decrease (Fig. 9a).  It may be that the rising ratios mirror the influx \nof industrial revolution PAHs (predominantly coal and wood combustion) up to 1915.    \n \n 12 \nThereafter, from 1915 onwards there was a rapid increase in the ratios of Anth:Phen, \nBaA:Chrys, and to some extent of IP:BghiP, all attaining maxima at about 30 cm and \nit was observed that total PAH concentration also followed this pattern.  These ratios \nall began to subside substantially after 20 cm, as did the total PAHs, and on the basis \nof the PCB evidence (i.e. start of extensive PCB use) a date of ca. 1950 may be \nassigned to sediment at this depth. Given that the peak in PCB concentration marks \nthe cessation of its large-scale usage, then a date of ca. 1977, may be accorded \nsediment at a depth of 8 cm. At this depth and above the total PAH concentration \ndiminished achieving its lowest value (592 \u00b5g\/kg) throughout the core just below the \nsurface at 3 cm.  From about 10 cm to the surface, and with total PAH concentration \nlow, the isomeric ratio behaviour was erratic.  The rise of total PAH and TPH \nconcentrations in the sediments after 1915 may possibly reflect the increasing use of \nfuel oil (bunker fuel) as a replacement for coal in ship propulsion (Dear & Kemp \n2006). In addition, this would have been supplemented by the emplacement of \nriverside petroleum refineries and the increasing use of petroleum by industries and \ntransport in general.  It will be noted that in the latter stages of the period the TPH \nconcentration remained high whilst the total PAH concentration began to wane (Fig. \n6) probably as a consequence of lessening coal use and increasing reliance on \npetroleum fuels.  Certainly, all the points, for the isomeric ratios in the period 1915 \n(40 cm) to 1977 (8 cm), plot in regions defined by the Yunker et al. criteria as \ncharacteristic of petroleum and its combustion (Fig. 9). Thus, Anth:Phen \u2013 \ncombustion region;  Fanth:Pyr \u2013 petroleum region; BaA:Chrys \u2013 combustion region; \nand IP:BghiP \u2013 petroleum and petroleum combustion regions.        \n \nCore 3A: Unfortunately, for dating purposes, no lead analysis (i.e. total concentration \nand isotopic ratios) had been conducted on this core.  Nevertheless, the PCB \nconcentration plot (Fig. 6a) made it possible to conjecture that at 13 cm beneath the \nsurface lay sediment deposited at the start of extensive PCB usage, conferring a date \nof ca. 1950.  Total PAH concentration remained relatively constant from 84 cm to 40 \ncm (ranging between 233 \u00b5g\/kg and 356 \u00b5g\/kg) as did three of the isomeric ratios \n(Fig. 9a), Anth:Phen 0.07-0.15 (petroleum\/combustion border), BaA:Chrys 0.15-0.20 \n(petroleum) & IP:BghiP 0.11-0.22 (petroleum\/petroleum combustion).  The Fanth:Pyr \nratio showed an overall downward trend and ranged from 0.15-0.36 \n(petroleum\/petroleum combustion). These low total concentrations in tandem with a \nstrong non-pyrolitic component probably signified a background PAH composition \ncomprising, in the main, aeolian deposition, i.e. from anthropogenic and natural \ncombustion sources (Jaward et al. 2004) together with a substantial biogenic PAH \ninput (Wilcke 2007).  The contrast between this background composition and a \ncombustion-contaminated composition can be illustrated by comparison of the PAH \ndistribution at 52.5 cm (total PAHs concentration 371 \u00b5g\/kg) with that at 17 cm (total \nPAHs concentration 11297 \u00b5g\/kg) as shown in Figure 11.   The numerals above each \nPAH plot refer to their relative abundance.  The relative abundances of the \nbiogenically-generated PAHs, i.e. naphthalene, phenanthrene and perylene (Wilcke \n2007) are much greater in the sediment at 52.5 cm compared with sediment at 17 cm.  \nFurthermore, the effect of difference in concentrations of isomer pairs upon the \ndiagnostic isomeric ratios can be appreciated, (e.g. at 17 cm Fanth and Pyr have \ncomparable concentrations leading to Fanth:Pyr ratio ~ 0.5 but at 52.5 cm [Fanth] < \n[Pyr] yielding a Fanth:Pyr ratio ~ 0.15 and similarly for BaA:Chrys and for IP:BghiP).  \nSediments deeper than 40 cm, therefore, probably pre-date significant industry.   \n \n 13 \nAbove 40 cm there began an increase in total PAH concentration probably denoting \nthe onset of the Clyde\u2019s industrial activities (Fig. 6a). Significant correlations between \nisomeric ratios and total PAH concentration emerged (Anth:Phen r2 = 0.567, \nFanth:Pyr r2 = 0.620, BaA:Chrys r2 = 0.676, IP:BghiP r2 = 0.379).  Thus, as total PAH \nconcentration increased so generally did the allied isomeric ratios signifying that the \nincrease was attributable to combustion-related processes.  This was supported by the \nprevalence of the pyrolitic PAHs, i.e. Fanth, Pyr, BaA, Chrys, BbF, BaP, BghiP and \nIP (McCready et al. 2000), in the PAH distribution for the sediment at 17 cm (Fig. \n11).  \n \nCore 4A:Data on total concentration and isotopic ratios (207\/206Pb) of lead for this core \nmade it possible to ascribe dates to sediment of ca. 1985 to that at 5 cm depth, ca. \n1925 to that at 29 cm, ca. 1915 to that at 36 cm and ca. 1835 to that at 88 cm (Fig. \n6a).  Thus, from the early industrial revolution it can be seen that there was a steady \nrise in total PAH concentrations from 1241 \u00b5g\/kg at 96 cm depth to a maximum of \n14932 \u00b5g\/kg at 32 cm, i.e. at ca. 1920 (Fig. 6a).  There was also, during this period a \nrise in the isomeric ratios for Anth:Phen, BaA:Chrys and IP:BghiP signifying the \npyrolitic nature of the PAH increase (Fig 9b). However, none of the ratios were high \nenough to achieve grass\/wood\/coal combustion status although doubtless such would \nhave made a major contribution. As mentioned earlier, the lack of prominence of this \nmay be attributable to the effect of a pronounced petrogenic contribution on the \nisomeric ratios of a grass\/wood\/coal contribution, i.e. producing an intermediate \npetroleum combustion value.  Thereafter, from ca 1920 (32 cm) to ca 1985 (5 cm) \nthere was a steady diminution in total PAH concentration.  At ca 1920 (32 cm) the \nTPH concentration began to increase rapidly and reached a peak at 19 cm depth.  \nGiven that it was at this depth that PCBs began their increase then a date of ca 1950 \nwould seem appropriate for the TPH maximum (Fig 6a).  This maximum some 30 \nyears after that of the total PAH concentration probably reflected diminishing coal \nuse, as the Clyde industrial slump became entrenched, and the rise of petroleum fuels \nas a major source of PAH.   This was supported by the decreasing isomeric ratios of \nAnth:Phen and BaA:Chrys over this period.  In fact, the behaviour of the Anth:Phen \nratio more or less faithfully tracked that of the total PAH concentration throughout the \ncore and a significant correlation between the two emerged when plotted (r2 = 0.574).   \n \nCore 5A: It is possible from lead isotopic data to attribute an approximate date of ca. \n1915 to sediment at 50 cm depth.  A perceptible rise in total PAH concentration \nappeared to occur at about 68 cm depth and possibly related to the effect of the \nindustrial revolution.  The curve for total PAH concentration and that for TOC were \ndistinctly similar with the two maxima on both plots coinciding (Fig. 6b).   Elevated \nlevels of PAH were maintained until a depth of 14 cm.  The TPH curve again seemed \nto convey an increased use of petroleum during the later period of elevated PAH \nconcentrations.  Isomeric ratio plots remained virtually constant with depth (Fig. 9b), \nexcept for the IP:BghiP ratio which appeared to track the period of elevated PAHs but \nwith an inverse relation, (i.e. it began to decrease when the total PAH concentration \nbegan to rise at 68 cm and increased as the PAH diminished from 22 cm upwards).  \nThis counter-intuitively implied increasing petrogenicity from ca 1915 with \nincreasing pyrogenicity in more modern times, contrary to the TPH evidence. All \nAnth: Phen ratios were close to the petroleum - combustion border at 0.1.  All \nFanth:Pyr ratios were close to the petroleum combustion \u2013 grass\/wood\/coal \ncombustion border at 0.5. All BaA:Chrys ratios (except one) were above 0.35, i.e. \n 14 \ncombustion. All IP:BghiP ratios plotted either in the petroleum or petroleum \ncombustion areas.     \n \nCore 6A: It was only in this core that TPH, PAH and PCB maximum concentrations \nwere coincident these peaks additionally corresponding with the smaller of two \nmaxima in the TOC plot (Fig. 6b). This could perhaps indicate a lack of industrial \nPAH contamination of the sediment deposited at this location, which was situated on \nthe mud-banks between the less industrial, suburban area of Port Glasgow and rural \nFinlaystone.  Lead concentrations and isotope ratios (207\/206Pb) suggested a date of ca. \n1986 for sediment at 18 cm depth and ca. 1915 at 45 cm depth.  The PCB peak \nindicated ca. 1977 for 18 cm with an approximate date of 1950 for sediment at 23 cm.   \n \nCore 7A: This core, taken furthest downstream, was the least PAH-contaminated of \nall the cores with total PAH concentrations that varied between 19 \u00b5g\/kg and 205 \n\u00b5g\/kg (Fig. 6b). As with the deeper parts of core 3A, the PAH levels in this core were \nessentially background and, although in this core perylene was not determined, the \ndistributions of PAHs were akin to those shown occurring at 52.5 cm depth in core 3A \n(Fig. 11). and all were characterised by high relative abundances of naphthalene and \nphenanthrene suggesting an appreciable natural biogenic PAH contribution (Wilcke \n2007).  Dating was difficult with data from lead concentrations and isotope ratios \n(207\/206Pb) not yielding any great precision.  Thus, sediment with a date of ca. 1986 \ncould only be defined as occurring somewhere between 15 cm and 28 cm depth. A \ndate of ca. 1915 could tentatively be assigned to sediment at about 65 cm depth.  The \nisomeric ratios remained essentially static throughout the core for BaA:Chrys, \nFanth:Pyr, IP:BghiP - except that the latter two ratios showed a sharp and inexplicable \nrise at 5 cm (Fig. 9b).  In marked contrast the Anth:Phen ratio displayed a peak that \ncoincided with the peak in total PAH concentration.  The increase in this ratio with \nthe concomitant rise in total PAH concentration signified a period of combustion-\nrelated PAH input to the sediment.  At their maximum the values of the ratio were \nonly marginally above 0.1 (i.e. there were two points, both 0.11, that plotted in the \ncombustion zone the rest were in the petroleum zone).   Fanth:Pyr ratios were mostly \n<0.4 (petroleum zone), with only two points >0.4, i.e. 0.41 (petroleum combustion) at \n46 cm and 0.60 (grass\/wood\/coal combustion) at 5 cm.  BaA: Chrys ratios were all at \nthe 0.35 combustion \u2013 mixed sources interface and varied between 0.32 to 0.38.  \nValues for the IP:BghiP ratio were all between 0.2 to 0.5, i.e. petroleum combustion. \nOn balance the data indicated a predominant petroleum\/petroleum combustion PAH \ninput to which a contribution from road traffic contribution was insignificant, i.e. \n[BghiP]\/[BaP] ratio was <3 throughout core.  The probability was, therefore, that the \nmajor PAH input arose from shipping emissions and petroleum-utilising riverside \nindustries.    \n \nTaking an overview of the PAH source ascription for the cores, based on the \nexamination of isomeric ratios in combination with core chronology (from total lead, \nlead isotopes and PCBs), total concentrations of organic species (PAH, TPH and \nPCBs) and TOC measurements, it has been possible to draw some conclusions \nregarding the provenance of PAHs in the sediment cores.  Evidence has been elicited \nfor the impact of road traffic via a criterion for the non-isomeric [BghiP]\/[BaP] ratio. \nAlthough isomeric ratios can provide information on the burning of grass, wood and \ncoal, distinct from that arising from petroleum combustion, the need to exercise \ncaution in a situation where there is a strong petrogenic PAH contribution was noted.  \n 15 \nThat said, in certain instances the isomeric ratios were of sufficient magnitude to \npermit a grass\/wood coal combustion attribution and this typically accompanied \ndating that hinted at the influence of industry and\/or the industrial revolution.  In cores \nthat exhibited low total PAH concentrations, and following consideration of PAH \ndistribution patterns, it was in some cases possible to detect the effect of biogenic \nPAHs.  In some instances certain isomeric ratios with depth were closely followed by \nthe total PAH concentration, e.g. Fanth:Pyr in core 1A, Anth:Phen in cores 4A & 7A \netc. but in other cases they were not.  Overall, in most cases the study of isomeric \nratios with depth was able to furnish at least some useful insights.  \n \n4. Conclusions \nWe applied a geochemical approach using Pb, 206\/207Pb, TPH, PCB and PAH to \ninvestigate the changing industrial and urban environment within the Clyde estuary \nover the past ~250 years.  The combination of organic pollutants, Pb contamination \nand Pb isotopic data within seven sediment cores facilitated the reconstruction of the \nmain environmental changes that occurred at the local and regional scale as well as a \npollutant inferred geochronology.  \n \n1) Comparison of the TPH, PAH and PCB concentration profiles and ratios \nshowed how relatively pristine Clyde sediments were contaminated by \nman\u2019s evolving industrial and urban activities. Five of the seven cores \nrecorded the rise, peak and decline of coal usage in the Clyde. Thereafter \nincreasing petroleum pollution from fuel oil (shipping) and petroleum \nrefinery sources was tracked followed by more modern pollution from \nchlorinated industrial chemicals (PCBs).  \n2) Organic pollutants were observed at concentrations which were typical of \nhighly industrialised estuary and are considered environmentally \nsignificant i.e. maximum TPH at 4386 mg\/kg, maximum total PAH at \n16163 \u00b5g\/kg mg\/kg and maximum total PCB at 1217 \u00b5g\/kg . In contrast \npre-industrial sediments were identified on the basis of low total PAH \nconcentrations together with high relative abundances of biogenic PAHs \nnaphthalene and phenanthrene. \n \n3) The predominant feature of the PAH isomeric cross plots, was the \nsignificance of petroleum-based acitivities on PAH inputs to the cores, i.e. \npetroleum combustion and unburnt fuel emissions from shipping, traffic \netc. together with petroleum product spills and discharges from local \nindustry and refineries.  Interestingly, this contrasts with our earlier study \nof the Inner Clyde, where the majority of the samples plotted in the \ncombustion \u2013 grass\/wood\/coal combustion region (Vane et al. 2007a).  \nThis difference was thought to be due to the much greater proximity of \ncoal-burning sources, domestic and industrial, for the samples from the \nInner Clyde. The benefit of isomeric ratio with depth plots over the \nisomeric cross plots was that, in concert with chronological data, they shed \nlight on the magnitude and dating of the inputs. Frequently, this could be \nsubstantiated by correlation with total PAH and TPH determinations. \n \n 16 \n4) Notwithstanding the complexities of pre and post depositional processes, \norganic pollutants may have some utility in establishing estuarine \nsedimentary chronology. For example, the PCB concentration profiles \nfrom stations 1A, 2A, 3A and 4A showed a clear rise fall and decline \nwhich may broadly indicate 1950\u2019s, 1965-77 and post-1980 respectively. \nSimilarly peak coal production in the Clyde (1915) and therefore peak \nPAH concentration appeared to be coincident and followed by increasing \npetroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations some 30 years later. \n \n5) The cores studied demonstrated variable Pb concentrations and isotope \nratios with depth. The changing pattern of lead isotope ratios in the cores \nwas matched with those from other well dated records such as that from \naerosol deposition on moss (Farmer et al, 2002). Key changes in ratio are \nknown to have occurred at specific times including: c1915 the introduction \nof non UK Broken Hill type lead for petrol and subsequent major \nindustrial products; 1980-1985 due to a reduction in petrol lead and c1750 \nthe beginning of the industrial revolution and major the input of lead into \naerosols, due to both smelting and coal burning. These have been used to \nplace putative dates on core depth intervals and allow a contaminant \nchronology to be established. \n \n6) This study has shown that there are numerous chemical markers within UK \nestuarine sediments that retain sufficient information to enable geologists \nto identify the late Anthropocene. Chemical fingerprints of past industrial \nheritage have evolved through the coal, petroleum and electrical ages. In \nthe Clyde the boundary between pre and post industrial revolution is \nsignalled by a change from low to high PAH concentrations as well as a \nswitch from biogenic to coal sourced PAH. Furthermore, commercially \nproduced industrial chemicals such as PCBs maybe utilised to mark other \nAnthropocene subdivisions-for instance the \u201celectrical age\u201d 1950s-1980s. \nHowever, it should be borne in mind that different regions of the world \nhave experienced industrialisation and the resulting environmental \ncontamination at different times. Thus any attempt to utilise a chemical \nmarker approach has to be underpinned by an understanding of which \npollutants are transported globally as well as local and regional historical \nknowledge of industry and urbanisation. \n \n \n5.
