(The French term vulgarisation carries even more of this pejorative sense). It is not surprising that this dominant view of popularisation is so prevalent, because it is the view of the process as seen from within scientific institutions, and it is the view promoted by those institutions (e.g., Royal Society of London 1985). Such a view of science as a discourse and popularisation as a genre, natural as it may seem, carries with it some assumptions about how texts should be studied. Following the dominant view, a set of texts could be identified to stand for popular science (articles in Scientific American, or best sellers on cosmology, reports in newspapers, or transcripts of television documentaries), and these texts could be compared to another set of research articles in scientific journals (such as Nature or Cell) that could be taken as the originals, perhaps even matched up as the sources of those popular texts.  There will certainly be some differences in textual form, in the sentence subjects, grammatical voice, verb choices, modality and hedging, and of course the rhetorical structure.  These differences can then be related back to the special qualities of scientific institutions, and applied to issues of teaching, translation, or public awareness.  My own studies a decade ago question the linear nature of the diffusion of knowledge, but still take for granted some of these assumptions about popularisation, especially in their focus on selected written texts (Myers 1989a; Myers 1990c; Myers 1990b; Myers 1991). The papers collected in this issue show how some of the assumptions of this dominant view are now being questioned in textual studies.  For instance Elisabeth G\u00fclich questions the boundary between expert and lay participants, and instead of     2 Scientific American, or a science journalist reports it in the Times, or when a television documentary shows the scientist walking across a leafy campus, the same material becomes popularization. The interest in popular science texts comes from applied linguists seeking to improve the teaching of languages for academic purposes (Myers 1989a), rhetoricians seeking to relate scientific discourse to other discourses (Fahnestock 1986), science studies scholars interested in the relation of science and society (Whitley 1985), science communication scholars interested in the practices of journalists and this special case of media effects (Lewenstein 1995b), historians placing science within public culture (Pumphrey and Cooter 1994), and not least, scientists themselves (Haldane 1985; Wolpert 1992; Dunbar 1995). Researchers such as those in this issue are likely to question some of the boundaries that have been assumed for popular science.  Earlier textual studies tend to fit within what has been called a \u2018dominant view\u2019 (Hilgartner 1990) or a \u2018canonical view\u2019 (Grundmann and Cavaill\u00e9 2000) of popularization.  This view assumes that there are two separate discourses, one within scientific institutions and one outside them, that information is translated from one of these discourses to the other.  There are several assumptions that go with this view: \u2022  that scientists and scientific institutions are the authorities on what constitutes science, \u2022  that the public sphere is, on scientific topics, a blank slate of ignorance on which scientists write knowledge, \u2022  that this knowledge travels only one way, from science to society, \u2022  that the content of science is information contained in a series of written statements,     1 Discourse Studies of Scientific Popularization: Questioning the Boundaries  Greg Myers Linguistics and Modern English Language Lancaster University Lancaster LA1 4YT, UK g.myers@lancs.ac.uk  Abstract This paper critiques a \u2018dominant view\u2019 of the popularization of science that takes it as a one-way process of simplification, one in which scientific articles are the originals of knowledge that is then debased by translation for a public that is ignorant of such matters, a blank slate.  It surveys recent work in several disciplines that questions boundaries of scientific discourse and genres of popularization:  who the actors are, how the discourses interact, what modes are involved, and what is communicated.  It draws implications from these studies for discourse analysis. Introduction The popularization of science is an unusual field for discourse analysis, because the scope of the field is defined in terms of what it is not.  There is no field that names all discussions of crime and punishment except those published in law journals, or all discussions of God except those given the imprimatur of an established church, or all discussions of politics except those in government documents. Popularization includes only texts about science that are not addressed to other specialist scientists, with the assumption that the texts that are addressed to other specialists are something else, something much better: scientific discourse.

It is true that surveys show again and again that members of the public cannot be counted on to know any specific piece of scientific information, however basic (Durant et al. 1989).  Thus studies of the Public Understanding of Science have tended towards what have been called deficit models (Wynne 1995), attempts to account for the boundless ignorance of people who don\u2019t know the difference between a virus and bacteria, or don\u2019t know how DNA works.  But if one starts at the other end, and asks what members of the public do know, about the areas of science and technology that concern them, one might be surprised (Irwin and Wynne 1996).  The parents of a child with a rare     5 challenges for textual studies.  We need to question who the actors are, how the various discourses interact, what modes are involves, and what it is that is communicated \u2013 and we need to consider what these questions imply for text analysts. Expert and lay audiences In the dominant view of popularization it is assumed that expert and lay audiences are divided by a vast gulf.  And this would certainly seem to be true, when as academics we browse in any section of the library apart from our own, or when we see how topics from our own specialist subjects are reported (if they are reported at all) in the media.  The gulf is clear enough when the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg writes a popular book on contemporary cosmology for nonphysicists:  he is clearly an expert, and I am not.  (I would like to think that on matters of discourse analysis I would be considered an expert and Professor Weinberg a lay reader, but  I am not sure this distinction would be so readily accepted by most members of the public or by policy-makers).  Despite being so apparently selfevident, the distinction between expert and lay audiences breaks down almost as soon as we try to apply it more widely. First, the sharp division between natural science and other areas of knowledge turns out to be of relatively recent origin.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries science was open to wider discussion among gentlemen (the restrictions of gender and class were often taken for granted) (Atkinson 1999; Lightman 1997; BensaudeVincent 2001; Cannon 1978; Cooter and Pumfrey 1994; Gates and Shteir 1997; Golinski 1992; Myers 1992; Myers 1989b).  One by one disciplines were institutionalized and amateurs excluded, for instance geology in the early nineteenth century, psychology not until the end of the century, linguistics not until the twentieth century.  The professionalization and specialization have played an important role in     4 focusing on written texts, looks at spoken interactions that cannot be seen as one-way transfers of information.  Giomar Ciapusco also stresses the importance of interactions between scientists and intermediaries such as science journalists.  Sophie Moirand argues that popularisation is not a linear process, from scientist to public, but a circuit.  It involves communicative as well as cognitive dimensions, and it is not written on a blank slate of public ignorance, but enters into an \u2018interdiscursive memory bank\u2019.  Helena Calsamiglia and Carmen Lopez Ferrero treat the quoting of both scientists and non-scientists within a larger framework of reported speech, so it is no longer a special case of the accurate or biased transfer of scientific knowledge, but a more general question of the construction and evaluation of actors in texts. Each of these studies treats popularisation, not just as a category of texts, but as a process that opens up questions about the actors, institutions, and forms of authority involved.  One way to think of these changes is to see science, not as a discourse, a single set of social practices around one thing, but as an order of discourse, a terrain of competing discourses and practices (Fairclough 1992). Popularisation is a routinized social activity that has led to the creation of a number of fairly stable genres \u2013one Scientific American article will have a very similar structure and style to another, or one newspaper feature article on, say, DNA fingerprinting, will have the same sorts of metaphors and rhetoric as others.   There is a temptation to stop there, with that description, but if we are going to draw wider implications from these analyses, we need to place them in the wider terrain of competing discourses.","cites":null},{"id":16362841,"title":"Science in Culture: The Early Victorian Period.","authors":[],"date":"1978","doi":"10.1017\/s0007087400017878","raw":"Cannon, S.

Secord\u2019s astonishing reconstruction of the response to \none Victorian bestseller (2000) is perhaps the most detailed account we have of the \naudience for popular science in any period.  These studies, and the studies of \nVictorian popularization introduced by Cooter and Pumphrey (1994), suggest how \nmuch there is to learn about the complex embedding of popular science texts in our \nown culture.   \n \n  16 \nformed in everyday practices:  the way a quoted speaker is introduced, a metaphor \nused instead of a technical term, a table summarized and simplified.  If we as \ndiscourse analysts take the boundaries as given and obvious at the outset, in our \nselection of texts, or of analytical tools, or of categories of social explanation, we miss \nthis work, and attribute authority as an essential aspect of science, rather than as an \nachievement. \nA note on further reading \n I have noted that different lines of research on popular science texts have \ndifferent aims.  For policymakers these analyses may identify problems and contribute \nto the promotion of scientific institutions.  For applied linguists they may assist in \nteaching scientists who are learning a new language, or in technical translation.  For \nrhetoricians and science communication scholars they may help make scientists\u2019 \nwriting more effective.  For cultural studies researchers they are one aspect of wider \ncultural change in gender, class relations, or relations to nature.  For historians they \nare one way of seeing science in a wider public culture.  Discourse analysts need to \nconsider work in all these strands.  (I think it is particularly unwise to seek out only \nthe strands that support one\u2019s own view of the authority of science in public debate, \nsince significant work has been done by both promoters and critics of science, and the \ntwo sides are not always as distinct as they may seem in the \u2018Science Wars\u2019).   \nFortunately there are several recent works that will serve as a good \nintroduction to these different strands.  Gregory and Miller (1998) is an excellent \noverview in English that covers both science studies and media studies perspectives, \nand gives useful examples.  The review articles by Lewenstein (1995b) and Wynne \n(1995) are still useful.  But I find the historical studies provide the most provocative \nand broad views of scientific texts in public culture.  Bazerman\u2019s study of Edison \n  15 \nauthority is at issue, the interaction is not a simple matter of the public examining the \ncredentials of the expert to see if he or she is qualified to speak on a topic;  it involves \nthe active construction of believable or discreditable identities, and alignments that \nmight shift in the course of one interaction (Hamilton 1998; Hinchliffe 1996; Myers \nand Macnaghten 1998; Myers forthcoming).  The failure of scientists to recognise \nthese interactions, and the subtlety and complexity that discourse researchers have \nshown in them, may account for some of their exasperation when their messages (on \nthe need for a supercollider, the applications of sociobiology, or the risks of nuclear \npower) do not have the desired effect. \nBoundary work \nOne could argue for the maintenance of each of the boundaries I have \ndescribed and questioned around popular science texts.  One could reasonably insist \nthat there is a place for expertise, genres of carefully examined claims, science as a \ndistinctive discourse, words (and mathematics) as privileged instruments of rational \nargument, and information stripped of personal interaction.  But for most of the issues \nin which popularization matters, such a carefully bounded, single-minded, and \nauthoritative science is not possible.  We cannot understand why there are tensions \nabout genetically-modified organisms, vaccinations, or climate change if we assume \nthat science is distinct from the rest of culture, and that the public is, on scientific \nmatters, a blank slate. \nMaintaining such boundaries takes work.  That is the claim made by Thomas \nGieryn in a classic article (1983), in which he traces the emergence of disciplines and \ndebates about authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Such \ndivisions between science and non-science, professional and non-professional, \ndivisions that we take for granted, were formed in historical struggles, and are re-\n  14 \nimages as examples in most academic journals.  And it reminds us that texts are \nirreducibly material:  words are essentially the same in a new font or on poorer quality \npaper, but the glossy picture, or the museum exhibit, or the lecture performance is \nlikely to miss something when reproduced on the page.  \nInformation and interaction \nThe dominant model of popularization assumes that the aim of the process is \nto convey scientific knowledge to a wider audience.  As we have seen, some studies \nmeasure the process by checking to see whether members of the public know certain \nfacts;  if they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t know science (for a critique of such studies, see \nWynne 1995).  Some scientific institutions also assume that if people knew more \nabout science, their attitudes towards the authority of science in matters of public \npolicy would change:  they would be more likely to believe estimates of the risk or \nsafety of nuclear power plants, vaccinations, or skin cancer.  But this is clearly not the \ncase;  people assess messages about risk in terms of such factors as their trust in the \nperson or institution telling them, its past record, their memory of other, similar \nissues, their feelings about how this issue fits with their own experience (Wynne \n1996b; Wynne 2001).   \nPopularization is a matter of interaction as well as information;  it involves \npersons and identities as well as messages.  Moirand makes this point when she \nreminds us that popular science involves communicative as well as cognitive \ndimensions.  G\u00fclich raises interactive issues, even though her examples are \nmonologues, because they are transcribed as the speech of a doctor trying to gauge, \nface-to-face, the responses of an audience.  Ciapuscio traces formulations in the \ninteractions between scientists and journalists.  Calsamiglia and Ferrero show how \ninteractions can be present in a polyphonic text.  In any case in which scientific \n  13 \nwith newspapers, not because these are necessarily the most influential sources of \nscience news, but because they are more convenient materials for research).  \nThis focus on written texts, even if it is traceable to purely practical \nconsiderations, limits studies of popularization.  First, some of the most dramatic and \nmemorable encounters with science are primarily visual, rather than verbal, whether it \nis Humphry Davy setting off great bolts of electricity in Royal Institution Lectures, \nDavid Attenborough grooming with gorillas in the BBC\u2019s documentary series Life on \nEarth, or pictures of the modified mouse with an ear on its back.  Second, a focus on \nwords ignores changes that are occurring in even the more traditional genres, such as \ntextbooks, as new production technologies enable them to use more pictures and more \ncomplex layouts (Bastide 1991; Miller 1998; Veel 1998; Lemke 1998).  Third, it \nlimits the places we look for popularization, so we may tend to ignore classrooms \n(Kress et al. 2001; Ogburn et al. 1996), or science museums (Bud 1988; Durant 1992; \nMacdonald 1996), as well as television, films, and ads.  Finally, the focus on the \nwords in popular science texts tends to reinforce the assumption that popularization is \njust a matter of simplifying and perhaps distorting the original message provided by \nscience.  If we look more broadly at the ways people experience popular science, we \nsee it as emerging from their lives, concerns, and everyday practices, whether taking \nnotes in class, or taking the kids for a day out. \nThere are now good guides for text analysts beginning visual analysis (Kress \nand van Leeuwen 1996; Kress and van Leeuwen 2001; van Leeuwen and Jewitt 2001; \nRose 2001).  But even if discourse analysts do analyse visual aspects of texts, there \nremain practical problems for any attempt to incorporate these analyses in our \narguments.  Reproduction of visual images raises copyright issues.  It also raises \nissues of technology;  it is still expensive and difficult to include high-quality colour \n  12 \nStudies have focused, not only on the features taken to be characteristic of scientific \ndiscourse, but also on features that leap from scientific discourse to political, social, \nand cultural discourses (and back the other way).  The links are often not matters of \nterminology, methods, or findings, but harder to pin down features such as metaphors \n(see G\u00fclich for instance), narratives (e.g., Seguin 2001; Myers 1990b), and imagery \n(Bastide 1991; Myers 1990a; Miller 1998; Brown 1999).  But discourse analysts have \nnot yet fully responded to the message from the historians and cultural studies \nresearchers, because we still often start with well-bounded disciplines.  If we started \ninstead with the scientific issues that concern the public, and took any one issue in \ndetail, we would find ourselves wandering through a bewildering range of other \ndiscourses and genres.  A study of DNA fingerprinting, on the face of it a scientific \ntopic, found first in scientific journals, would lead to issues of chance and probability, \nguilt and innocence, race, nationality, and the conception of what it is to be an \nindividual.  When reporters frame news articles on DNA fingerprinting, they are \nthinking of these possible ways of relating the techno-scientific elements to the things \npeople care about, and when readers pick up the articles they interpret them in terms \nof just these frames.  \nWords and other modes of communication \nResearch on popularization has focused overwhelmingly on the words of \npopular science texts, rather than visual elements, objects, embodied movement, or \nother codes.  This focus is perhaps inevitable, since discourse analysts (and also \nhistorians, sociologists, and media studies scholars) have more tools handy for \nanalysing words.  Also, written texts are easier to collect, store, and analyse. (Gregory \nand Miller (1998, p. 105) point out that most media studies research on science deals \n  11 \nand enters back into the culture of the period, whether it is Boyle (Shapin and \nSchaffer 1985), Davy (Golinski 1992), Darwin (Desmond and Moore 1991; Young \n1985), early nineteenth-century geology (Rudwick 1985), early twentieth-century \nstatistics (Mackenzie 1981), or the whole history of the human sciences (Smith 1997).  \nScience has been in every period a part of public culture, drawing on and contributing \nto ideas about nature, the place of humans in nature, the direction of history, the \nnature of government and economy.   \nPerhaps it might seem that these links had been severed with the emergence of \nprofessionalised disciplines and institutions, that these disciplines had become \nautonomous and followed their own internal logics in their development.  But it is \nmore likely that the links are harder to see, since our own cultural frameworks are just \nwhat we take for granted.  Current cultural studies of science show the interaction of \nscience with popular ideas on gender, race, kinship, progress, identity, sexuality, and \nsocial organisation (e.g., Franklin 1997; Haraway 1989; Nelkin and Lindee 1995; \nTraweek 1988) \u2013 one can see evidence in every issue of the journal Science as \nCulture.  Metaphors cross over being scientific and popular discourses (Bastide 1992; \nHedgecoe 1999; V\u00e4liverronen 1998; V\u00e4liverronen and Hellsten 2002; Hellsten 2003).  \nTo return to the example of the Measles Mumps Rubella vaccination, the vaccine was \nproduced because of a widespread cultural model of disease and its prevention, it was \npromoted using epidemiological models of risk, and it is resisted because of other \nmodels of risk, responsibility for one\u2019s children, and trust in authority, and because of \nexperiences with other episodes of risk and the reassurances and denials by \nauthorities. \nThat scientific discourses are embedded in and intertwined with other courses \nis probably easy enough for discourse analysts (if not for some scientists) to accept.  \n  10 \nexplain one\u2019s project, and its relevance to wider society, in non-specialist terms, or to \ncolleagues, is an essential part of running a large lab and getting further funding.  And \nsometimes it is essential to be able to explain, again in nonspecialist terms, why a \ncompeting claim about global warming models, vaccination risks, or cold fusion is \nwrong.  Only from the outside, and from a great distance, does scientific discourse \nseem to employ a single unified register. \nThe implication of this continuum for discourse analysts is that one needs to \nbe very careful about how one aggregates texts to represent a discourse.  Much of the \nresearch on popularisation has involved case studies of a single text (e.g., Myers \n1990a; Selzer 1993; Fuller 1998).  But as soon as one tries to go further, one raises \ncomplex questions of genre.  Are the news articles at the beginning of Nature, \ndrawing attention to more specialist articles in the issue, specialist or popularizing \ntexts?  How about grant proposals?  Medical journal articles aimed at general \npractitioners?  Advanced textbooks?  Textual analysts, like practicing scientific \nwriters, need to be prepared for hybridity.  So any claim one makes, about the use of \nreferences, or the hedging, or the illustrations, needs to relate back to what this \nparticular text is doing here, not to assumptions about what texts like this in general \nmust do, and not to broad distinctions between real science and some imitation. \nScience and other discourses \n  Just as the dominant view assumes a deficit model of members of the public, \nit assumes that the scientific information, when it arrives, is written on a blank slate of \npublic culture.  There is no sense in this view of the cultural schemas through which \nmight make sense of science and make it relevant to their lives, except when these \nschemas are treated as outmoded commonsense, bias, ideology, and ignorance.  Yet it \nis a clear message of history of science, in every period, that science emerges from \n  9 \nsimplification.  But discourse analysts must remember that scientific discourse \ninvolves a range of genres and practices, and that popularizations are an important \npart of this range.  As Stephen Hilgartner says, \u2018popularization is a matter of degree\u2019 \n(Hilgartner 1990, p. 528.).  The collection of texts one makes to show \u2018specialist\u2019 or \n\u2018popular\u2019 genres may itself be mixed in terms of its audiences, intentions, or register. \nDeveloping a scientific claim and being a successful scientist require \ninvolvement in a range of genres: talking informally with colleagues, writing \nproposals that must be readable and persuasive outside the specialist field, delivering \npapers and responding to questions, all of what Hilgartner calls the \u2018upstream\u2019 side of \na journal publication (1990, p. 528).  More controversially, the success of a claim \ninvolves its being cited, featured in review articles (Bazerman and Paradis 1991), \nincluded in textbooks, and in some cases, reported in the media and in government \npolicy documents \u2013 what Hilgartner calls the \u2018downstream\u2019 side of a journal \npublication.  Just where does popularization start in this stream?  In controversial \ncases, scientists can dismiss preprints, conference talks, review articles and \ngovernment reports as simplifications, or they may claim these parallel forms of \npublication as embodiments of scientific authority (Lewenstein 1995a).   \nThe continuum is not just a matter of a range of genres;  within each genre \nthere may be a range of registers or repertoires, different ways of speaking for \ndifferent rhetorical purposes.  Any detailed study of the practices of scientists shows \nthat they do not confine themselves to the kind of language used in published \nscientific articles;  they move between several repertoires (Latour and Woolgar 1979; \nMyers 1990c; Gilbert and Mulkay 1984).  The informal uses of language cannot be \nruled out as unscientific;  it is in casual talk that the science gets done as a practical \nmatter (Lynch 1985; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Ochs and Jacoby 2000).  Being able to \n  8 \nher child had these symptoms just after the jab is enough to reawaken fears and \nreduce the take-up of the vaccinations.   \nIt is just this sort of resistance to scientific expertise that maddens scientists, \nbecause they see it as a blinkered refusal to participate in the benefits brought by \nscientific progress and a scientific world view (Wolpert 1992; Gross and Levitt 1994;  \nor for a more nuanced and witty discussion, Dunbar 1995).  But one need not re-open \nthe debates about the authority of science (called in the US \u2018The Science Wars\u2019) to \nsee that debates in the public sphere have to draw on arguments that work in the \npublic sphere.  Specialist expertise gives some strong arguments in this sphere, but \nthey are not the only possible arguments. \nIf claims to expertise are not to be found only in scientific journals and \nscientific institutions, then researchers who want to understand public understanding \nof science have to look beyond collections of research articles, and consider all the \nways people attribute or claim expertise in discourse.  This may involve studying \npopular science texts as part of scientific discourse in their own right, and examining \ntheir use of the literature or presentation of the authors or qualification of claims \n(Selzer 1993; Fuller 1998; Nelkin 1987; Lewenstein 1995a; Myers 1990b).  But it \nmay just as well involve studying other forums, such as the once-popular pedagogical \ngenre of \u2018conversations\u2019 (Bahar 2001; Myers 1989b), or meetings of workers held in \npubs (Secord 1994b; Secord 1994a), or internet newsgroup exchanges on rapidly \nbreaking news of a risk in the food chain (Richardson 2001).  \nThe continuum of popularization \nIn the dominant view of popularization, a research article (preferably just one) \nis the ultimate source of undiluted and undistorted science.  For some approaches, for \ninstance bibliometric studies of scientific disciplines, that may be a useful \n  7 \nmedical syndrome may have a considerable knowledge of that syndrome.  Opponents \nof nuclear power (as well as companies promoting it) have a considerable knowledge \nof the science of nuclear hazards and the technology or nuclear waste storage.  \nFarmers know about the grazing habits of sheep, and if they have been subject to \ncontrols after nuclear contamination, they may know about that too (Wynne 1996a; \nWynne 1996b).  Bantam breeders may know a great deal of practical genetics.  Patent \nattorneys may surprise their clients with their knowledge of the science behind an \ninvention.  (See the journals Public Understanding of Science and Science as Culture \nfor many studies along these lines).  These areas of specialist knowledge are unevenly \ndistributed;  more people are interested in health and risk issues than in, say, algebraic \ntheory or materials science (or linguistics).  But there is no reason to expect the \nspecialisms of contemporary science to map onto the categories of contemporary \npublic interest. \nMembers of the public who challenge scientific claims will never have the \nsame sort of authority as scientific experts, because they cannot marshal the same \nnetworks of support for their claims (Latour 1987).  Scientists would point out that the \npublic should not have the same kind of authority, because their claims have not been \nsubjected to the kind of challenges that claims undergo in scientific discourse \n(Bazerman 1988).  But members of the public have their own persuasive resources, \nbecause they can connect the abstractions of scientific knowledge to lived experience, \nand public debates provide their own sorts of challenges to arguments.  Consider for \ninstance the controversy in Britain about the possible link between the Measles \nMumps Rubella \u2018triple jab\u2019 and some forms of autism.  The weight of published \nmedical research, institutional policy, and doctors\u2019 advice is firmly on the side of the \nrelative safety of the vaccination.  But a radio interview with a mother who says that \n  6 \nthe explosive growth of scientific research, and have had many beneficial effects, but \nthey were not inevitable or intrinsic to the subject matter of science. \nSecond, experts become less expert as soon as they step outside their very \nlimited specialism.  A professional scientist might read or teach in areas far removed \nfrom their day-to-day research, and in those areas they have to rely on mediators: \nemploying recently-trained post docs, plowing through review articles, even reading \ntextbooks or Scientific American.   In media interviews, a developmental biologist \nmight be treated as expert in all areas of biology, or even all areas of science and \ntechnology \u2013 but the biologist will not expect to be treated this way by their \ncolleagues.  When I go to the doctor, I treat her as an expert in medicine, but her \nrelation to current medical research will generally be as a continuing student, not as a \nparticipant, and the medical journals have to perform a kind of popularizing function \nfor her.  Administrators, medical students, patent lawyers, post-docs, technicians, \nscience journalists, and research scientists in commercial firms all take on, sometimes \nuncomfortably, an identity between expert and lay.  Yet such boundary figures are \nessential to the maintenance of science and technology. \nNor is the public entirely cut off from expertise.  It is true that surveys show \nagain and again that members of the public cannot be counted on to know any specific \npiece of scientific information, however basic (Durant et al. 1989).  Thus studies of \nthe Public Understanding of Science have tended towards what have been called \ndeficit models (Wynne 1995), attempts to account for the boundless ignorance of \npeople who don\u2019t know the difference between a virus and bacteria, or don\u2019t know \nhow DNA works.  But if one starts at the other end, and asks what members of the \npublic do know, about the areas of science and technology that concern them, one \nmight be surprised (Irwin and Wynne 1996).  The parents of a child with a rare \n  5 \nchallenges for textual studies.  We need to question who the actors are, how the \nvarious discourses interact, what modes are involves, and what it is that is \ncommunicated \u2013 and we need to consider what these questions imply for text analysts. \nExpert and lay audiences \nIn the dominant view of popularization it is assumed that expert and lay \naudiences are divided by a vast gulf.  And this would certainly seem to be true, when \nas academics we browse in any section of the library apart from our own, or when we \nsee how topics from our own specialist subjects are reported (if they are reported at \nall) in the media.  The gulf is clear enough when the Nobel Prize-winning physicist \nSteven Weinberg writes a popular book on contemporary cosmology for non-\nphysicists:  he is clearly an expert, and I am not.  (I would like to think that on matters \nof discourse analysis I would be considered an expert and Professor Weinberg a lay \nreader, but  I am not sure this distinction would be so readily accepted by most \nmembers of the public or by policy-makers).  Despite being so apparently self-\nevident, the distinction between expert and lay audiences breaks down almost as soon \nas we try to apply it more widely.   \nFirst, the sharp division between natural science and other areas of knowledge \nturns out to be of relatively recent origin.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries \nscience was open to wider discussion among gentlemen (the restrictions of gender and \nclass were often taken for granted) (Atkinson 1999; Lightman 1997; Bensaude-\nVincent 2001; Cannon 1978; Cooter and Pumfrey 1994; Gates and Shteir 1997; \nGolinski 1992; Myers 1992; Myers 1989b).  One by one disciplines were \ninstitutionalized and amateurs excluded, for instance geology in the early nineteenth \ncentury, psychology not until the end of the century, linguistics not until the twentieth \ncentury.  The professionalization and specialization have played an important role in \n  4 \nfocusing on written texts, looks at spoken interactions that cannot be seen as one-way \ntransfers of information.  Giomar Ciapusco also stresses the importance of \ninteractions between scientists and intermediaries such as science journalists.  Sophie \nMoirand argues that popularisation is not a linear process, from scientist to public, but \na circuit.  It involves communicative as well as cognitive dimensions, and it is not \nwritten on a blank slate of public ignorance, but enters into an \u2018interdiscursive \nmemory bank\u2019.  Helena Calsamiglia and Carmen Lopez Ferrero treat the quoting of \nboth scientists and non-scientists within a larger framework of reported speech, so it is \nno longer a special case of the accurate or biased transfer of scientific knowledge, but \na more general question of the construction and evaluation of actors in texts.   \nEach of these studies treats popularisation, not just as a category of texts, but \nas a process that opens up questions about the actors, institutions, and forms of \nauthority involved.  One way to think of these changes is to see science, not as a \ndiscourse, a single set of social practices around one thing, but as an order of \ndiscourse, a terrain of competing discourses and practices (Fairclough 1992).  \nPopularisation is a routinized social activity that has led to the creation of a number of \nfairly stable genres \u2013one Scientific American article will have a very similar structure \nand style to another, or one newspaper feature article on, say, DNA fingerprinting, \nwill have the same sorts of metaphors and rhetoric as others.   There is a temptation to \nstop there, with that description, but if we are going to draw wider implications from \nthese analyses, we need to place them in the wider terrain of competing discourses. \nIn this review, I will not try to review all the fields that have contributed to \nstudies of popular science texts (for overviews, see Shinn and Whitley 1985; \nLewenstein 1995b; Gregory and Miller 1998; Bensaude-Vincent 2001), but focus on \nsome of the challenges to the boundaries of the field, and the implications of these \n  3 \n\u2022 and that in the course of translation from one discourse to the other, this \ninformation not only changes textual form, but is simplified, distorted, hyped \nup, and dumbed down. (The French term vulgarisation carries even more of \nthis pejorative sense).   \nIt is not surprising that this dominant view of popularisation is so prevalent, because it \nis the view of the process as seen from within scientific institutions, and it is the view \npromoted by those institutions (e.g., Royal Society of London 1985).    \nSuch a view of science as a discourse and popularisation as a genre, natural as \nit may seem, carries with it some assumptions about how texts should be studied.  \nFollowing the dominant view, a set of texts could be identified to stand for popular \nscience (articles in Scientific American, or best sellers on cosmology, reports in \nnewspapers, or transcripts of television documentaries), and these texts could be \ncompared to another set of research articles in scientific journals (such as Nature or \nCell) that could be taken as the originals, perhaps even matched up as the sources of \nthose popular texts.  There will certainly be some differences in textual form, in the \nsentence subjects, grammatical voice, verb choices, modality and hedging, and of \ncourse the rhetorical structure.  These differences can then be related back to the \nspecial qualities of scientific institutions, and applied to issues of teaching, translation, \nor public awareness.  My own studies a decade ago question the linear nature of the \ndiffusion of knowledge, but still take for granted some of these assumptions about \npopularisation, especially in their focus on selected written texts (Myers 1989a; Myers \n1990c; Myers 1990b; Myers 1991). \nThe papers collected in this issue show how some of the assumptions of this \ndominant view are now being questioned in textual studies.  For instance Elisabeth \nG\u00fclich questions the boundary between expert and lay participants, and instead of \n  2 \nScientific American, or a science journalist reports it in the Times, or when a \ntelevision documentary shows the scientist walking across a leafy campus, the same \nmaterial becomes popularization.   \nThe interest in popular science texts comes from applied linguists seeking to \nimprove the teaching of languages for academic purposes (Myers 1989a), rhetoricians \nseeking to relate scientific discourse to other discourses (Fahnestock 1986), science \nstudies scholars interested in the relation of science and society (Whitley 1985), \nscience communication scholars interested in the practices of journalists and this \nspecial case of media effects (Lewenstein 1995b), historians placing science within \npublic culture (Pumphrey and Cooter 1994), and not least, scientists themselves \n(Haldane 1985; Wolpert 1992; Dunbar 1995).   \nResearchers such as those in this issue are likely to question some of the \nboundaries that have been assumed for popular science.  Earlier textual studies tend to \nfit within what has been called a \u2018dominant view\u2019 (Hilgartner 1990) or a \u2018canonical \nview\u2019 (Grundmann and Cavaill\u00e9 2000) of popularization.  This view assumes that \nthere are two separate discourses, one within scientific institutions and one outside \nthem, that information is translated from one of these discourses to the other.  There \nare several assumptions that go with this view:  \n\u2022 that scientists and scientific institutions are the authorities on what constitutes \nscience, \n\u2022 that the public sphere is, on scientific topics, a blank slate of ignorance on \nwhich scientists write knowledge,  \n\u2022 that this knowledge travels only one way, from science to society,  \n\u2022 that the content of science is information contained in a series of written \nstatements, \n  1 \nDiscourse Studies of Scientific Popularization:  \nQuestioning the Boundaries \n \nGreg Myers \nLinguistics and Modern English Language \nLancaster University \nLancaster LA1 4YT, UK \ng.myers@lancs.ac.uk \n \nAbstract \n This paper critiques a \u2018dominant view\u2019 of the popularization of science that \ntakes it as a one-way process of simplification, one in which scientific articles are the \noriginals of knowledge that is then debased by translation for a public that is ignorant \nof such matters, a blank slate.  It surveys recent work in several disciplines that \nquestions boundaries of scientific discourse and genres of popularization:  who the \nactors are, how the discourses interact, what modes are involved, and what is \ncommunicated.  It draws implications from these studies for discourse analysis. \nIntroduction \n The popularization of science is an unusual field for discourse analysis, \nbecause the scope of the field is defined in terms of what it is not.  There is no field \nthat names all discussions of crime and punishment except those published in law \njournals, or all discussions of God except those given the imprimatur of an established \nchurch, or all discussions of politics except those in government documents.  \nPopularization includes only texts about science that are not addressed to other \nspecialist scientists, with the assumption that the texts that are addressed to other \nspecialists are something else, something much better: scientific discourse.
