Nitric acid (HNO3) or other aggressive oxidizing \nagents are also normally used to remove any extraneous organic material. Due to the \ntoxicity of these mineral acids, these procedures must be done in a fume hood. This \nprocedure is potentially hazardous and polluting. Therefore effective non-acid \npreparation techniques would be significantly preferable. Other disadvantages of acid \ndigestion are that the reagents are relatively expensive and reaction times can be long. \nRecently, a non-acid method using sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaPO3)6] was \ndescribed (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2004; 2006; Riding et al. 2006). In this \nmethod, the (NaPO3)6 deflocculates the clay minerals, so they can be sieved away in \norder to concentrate the organic fraction. This non-acid technique is generally quicker \nand hence cheaper than the traditional acid-based procedure; it is unequivocally \nsignificantly safer and more environmentally friendly. It also has the significant \nadvantage that it also extracts palynomorphs and other microfossils, notably \nsilicofossils (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2004, text-figs 6e, f)). The (NaPO3)6 method \n 3\nhas been tested on material of Ordovician, Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, \nPaleogene, and Quaternary age. It appears to be less effective on carbonates and \nrelatively highly indurated siliciclastic sample material (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, \n2004; 2006). The purpose of this contribution is to describe a new preparation method \nusing hot hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and to report the results of testing this procedure \non Carboniferous, Jurassic, Paleogene, and Quaternary sample material. \n \n \nTHE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED USE OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IN \nPALYNOLOGICAL PROCESSING \n \nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) physico-chemically disaggregates clay-rich \nsediments\/sedimentary rocks, and therefore can extract calcareous microfossils, \nphosphatic microfossils, palynomorphs, and silicofossils. The effect of H2O2 on \nsediments and sedimentary rocks is simultaneously to break down the fabric, and to \noxidize the organic material. Because H2O2 is a powerful oxidizing agent, great care \nmust be taken to avoid damage to, and\/or degradation of, the less robust \npalynomorphs (Hopkins and McCarthy, 2002). Leschik (1956) and Brown (1960) \ndescribed using H2O2 to prepare brown coal; the H2O2 oxidizes the powdered coal \nprior to other chemical treatment. Smith and Butterworth (1967, p. 102) also \ndescribed a procedure for preparing lignites by boiling in H2O2. These authors gently \nboiled 1 g of powdered coal in 50 ml of 100% H2O2 for at least six hours to oxidize \nthe coal. Smith and Butterworth (1967) warned that if the coal is pyritic, this reaction \ncan be violent. Funkhouser and Evitt (1959), Traverse (1988), and Eshet and Hoek \n(1996) mentioned the use of H2O2 as an oxidizing agent, used following HCl\/HF \ndigestion. Furthermore, Jenkins (1967), Doher (1980), and Batten (1999) stated that \nH2O2 can be used to bleach darkened palynomorphs due to its oxidizing properties. \nCollinson (1980) briefly described the use of H2O2 to disaggregate a silty clay of Late \nEocene age. The residue was sieved after H2O2 treatment, and palynomorphs were \nrecovered. The extraneous mineral matrix was removed using HF, and the \npalynomorphs lightened with Schultze\u2019s solution. This disaggregation using H2O2 was \npreviously used to extract sporangia from Paleogene clays from southern England \n(Collinson, 1978). Here the clays were soaked in dilute H2O2 solution for between 15 \nand 60 minutes. The H2O2 disaggregates the clay much more effectively than water or \nsodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution. Pearson and Scott (1999) mentioned that 10% \nH2O2 can be used to disaggregate some clay-rich lithotypes in order to release \nmegaspores. Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2004; 2006) outlined the use of H2O2 \ntreatment for 15-20 minutes in order to break down rock fragments that resisted \ndisaggregation using (NaPO3)6. Another significant paper on this topic is Williams et \nal. (2005) who described palynomorph preparation using H2O2, and demonstrated its \nutility in five case histories. These authors stated that trial and error are required to \ndetermine both the optimum concentration of H2O2, and the timing of the treatment. \nThe nature of the palynomorphs and the lithology of the sample material determine \nboth these parameters. Clay-rich material which has been buried to less than 3000 m \nneeds a 6% H2O2 solution. If the sample material is siltstone, and\/or has been deeply \nburied, a 12% solution of H2O2 is preferable. The duration of the H2O2 treatment can \nvary from between 1 and 30 minutes, depending on the rate of disaggregation. \nWilliams et al. (2005) used 3% to 12% H2O2, and noted that certain dinoflagellate \ncyst taxa such as Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum can be destroyed. This phenomenon \ncan be prevented by reducing the concentration of the reagent, and the duration of the \n 4\ntreatment. When the sample is adequately disaggregated, the residue is passed through \na nest of sieves with mesh sizes from 63 \u03bcm to 1 mm, and gravity-separated to \nconcentrate the palynomorphs. The residue is cleaned of fine mineral particles and \nkerogen using sieves and detergent. Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2006) prepared three \nPaleozoic samples using H2O2. The crushed sample was heated to 70\u02daC, covered in \nH2O2, and left for five minutes. It was then diluted with water at 60\u02daC and left for 15 \nminutes, or until any reaction was complete. The residue was sieved at 10 \u03bcm in order \nto remove the fine extraneous debris, then at 500 \u03bcm to remove any >500 \u03bcm \nfragments. The process was repeated as many times as necessary until all the >500 \n\u03bcm fragments have disaggregated. The mineral fraction was separated using a suitable \ngravity method. This method proved ineffective on the Lower Ordovician \n(Tremadocian) Shineton Shale Formation and the Lower Carboniferous Lawmuir \nFormation. These were not fully disaggregated by this method. By contrast, a sample \nof the Lower Carboniferous Ballagan Formation produced a moderately abundant \npalynoflora using H2O2, but this was not as rich as the preparations made using \nHCl\/HF digestion and (NaPO3)6 (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2006, table 1, pl. 2, figs. \n1, 2). The reduced yield may be due to the oxidizing effects of H2O2. \nHydrogen peroxide is therefore an extremely important reagent in \npalynological preparation, especially when the use of mineral acids is precluded. \nHowever, because of the oxidizing effects of H2O2, more development work is needed \nto accurately assess its potential. \n \n \nTHE NEW METHOD OF PALYNOMORPH PROCESSING USING HOT \nHYDROGEN PEROXIDE \n \n The method used in this study is described step-by-step in Appendix 1. Firstly \nthe sample material is crushed, or broken up, to maximise the surface area in contact \nwith the H2O2, and to minimise any mechanical damage to the palynomorphs. The \nfragmented sample is heated to ca. 100\u02daC and treated with 15-30% H2O2 for 10 \nminutes. The concentration of the H2O2 is dependent upon the induration level of the \nsample material. It was found that H2O2 is more effective on sample material which \nhas been pre-heated. The residue is then diluted with water, causing the disaggregated \nmaterial to float. This is decanted into a beaker containing water to dilute the H2O2. \nFrequently, some undisaggregated sample will remain. Therefore, the \nundisaggregated residue is reheated, and the 10 minute maceration in H2O2 is repeated \nas many times as necessary until all the sample is broken down. It may be possible \nand\/or necessary to extend the treatment time, leaving the residue for longer than 10 \nminutes. When all of the sample material is entirely disaggregated, the aqueous \nresidue can be further processed as appropriate. \n The new method described here and the procedure of Riding and Kyffin-\nHughes (2006, p. 87) are somewhat similar. They are both based on the exposure to \nthe heated sample material to H2O2 for relatively short periods of time (5-10 minutes) \nin order to disaggregate the outer surface. The treatment is done in a stepwise fashion \nso that the organic materials are not exposed to H2O2 for prolonged periods, hence the \npossibility of damage by oxidation is minimised. The new method is considered to be \nsuperior to that of Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2006) because the sample has less \ncontact time with the H2O2, and the residue does not need to be sieved after each \nexposure to H2O2. These factors meant that palynomorph losses via oxidation and \nduring sieving are minimised. \n 5\n \n \nHYDROGEN PEROXIDE \u2013 BACKGROUND AND HEALTH\/SAFETY \nASPECTS \n \nThe systematic name of H2O2 is dihydrogen dioxide, but it is universally \nknown as hydrogen peroxide. Pure H2O2 is a pale blue liquid, however it is colorless \nin dilute solution. It is a weak acid, and slightly more viscous than water. Because of \nits strong oxidizing properties, it has been used as a bleaching agent (e.g. for human \nhair), a disinfectant, and a propellant. Hydrogen peroxide is used extensively to \nbleach paper and pulp, and in the chemical industry. \nThe principal hazards of H2O2 are that it is a strong oxidant and it is corrosive, \nespecially at concentrations greater than 50%. However, typical concentrations are \nbetween 3 and 35%; solutions greater than 60% present markedly increased risks. It is \nnon-flammable, however it can form potentially explosive compounds when \ncombined with several other chemicals and materials. The latter include inorganic and \norganic compounds, and metallic elements. Furthermore, H2O2 readily dissociates, \nespecially when heated, to form water and oxygen. Naturally, any build-up of oxygen \nrepresents an increased fire hazard. Hence it should not be stored, or used, close to \nany potential fuels. The concentrations of H2O2 used in microfossil extraction sensu \nlato (i.e. <30%) are such that these hazards are minimal, given safe laboratory \npractice. For example, potentially explosive H2O2 vapor is only given off using ca. \n>70% H2O2 at >70\u00b0C. It also should be stored in cool conditions in robust containers \nmade from a neutral (i.e. nonreactive or noncatalytic) material. Up to date safety data \nfor 30% H2O2 are given as a Manufacturer\u2019s Safety Data Sheet at: \nhttp:\/\/ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk\/MSDS\/HY\/hydrogen_peroxide_30pc.html. \nIn terms of safe palynology laboratory operations, this means storing the H2O2 \nin a suitable cool, dark place which is well separated from any potential fuels. It \nshould be handled with care, as all chemical reagents are in a well run laboratory. \nHydrogen peroxide is far less corrosive than hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, but \nshould be used with similar safeguards and precautions. This is a new technique, and \nevery laboratory undertaking this procedure should undertake a thorough risk \nassessment. The principal risk associated with the method is the fact that when heated, \nH2O2 gives off oxygen. Therefore, H2O2 should be used in an efficient fume cupboard \nwhile wearing adequate personal protective equipment, most importantly safety \nglasses and acid-resistant gloves. The most important factor is that the fume cupboard \neffectively removes the oxygen which is given off so that there is no build-up in the \nfume cupboard. The use of H2O2 in the technique described herein is entirely safe, \nprovided there are no potential fuel materials in the fume cupboard, and\/or substances \nwhose vapor could mix with the oxygen given off during the maceration. Due to the \nwide range of materials which are flammable in the presence of increased oxygen \nlevels, H2O2 macerations should be done in a dedicated, otherwise empty, fume \ncupboard with the sash down. Obviously, a fuel vapor\/oxygen mixture is potentially \nexplosive and flammable. This means, for example, that organic liquids should not be \nin, or near to, the fume cupboard during maceration with H2O2. \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n 6\nIn this study, eight samples of Carboniferous, Jurassic, Paleogene, and \nQuaternary age were prepared using hot 30% H2O2. For comparative purposes, the \nsamples were also prepared using the traditional HCl\/HF acid digestion technique \nand\/or the technique using (NaPO3)6 of Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2004). The \nsamples are listed in Appendix 2, and selected low-magnification photomicrographs \nof the residues are presented in Plates 1-5. All rock samples, organic residues, \nmicroscope slides, primary data, and illustrated material are housed in the collections \nof the British Geological Survey (BGS), Keyworth, Nottingham, U.K. All the \npalynomorph taxa at and below species level which are mentioned are listed in \nAppendix 3, with their respective author citations. The new preparation procedure \nusing H2O2 is outlined in Appendix 1. The eight samples were prepared quantitatively \nusing the method described by Harland (1989) and Gelsthorpe (2002). This allows the \npalynomorphs extracted per gram of sample to be determined. This quantitative \nmethod allows the effectiveness of both the techniques used to be objectively \ncompared. The quantitative results are given in Table 1. The palynomorph residues \nderived from the H2O2, (NaPO3)6, and HCl\/HF preparations vary significantly. For \nexample, the H2O2 treatment does not consistently disaggregate all the sample \nmaterial, especially in the case of some of the older and more indurated sedimentary \nrocks (Table 1). \n \n \nCASE STUDIES \n \nThe Portsmouth Member, Cuyahoga Formation (Lower Carboniferous, \nMississippian, Kinderhookian\/Osagean) of the Springville Hill road cutting, \nSouth Portsmouth, Kentucky, U.S.A (samples 1 and 2; H2O2 and (NaPO3)6 \npreparation methods, both quantitative) \n \nTwo samples of the Portsmouth Shale Member of the Cuyahoga Formation \nwere collected from Springville Hill road cutting, directly across the Ohio River from \nPortsmouth, Ohio. The Two Mile Hill section, north of Portsmouth, is traditionally \nregarded as the type section of the Portsmouth Shale Member, but no formal type \nsection was designated by Hyde (1915). The Springville Hill road cutting is \nconsidered to be an important reference section. This succession is known to be rich \nin palynomorphs. \nThe samples are both mudstones and were processed using H2O2 and \n(NaPO3)6. There was insufficient material to prepare the samples using HCl\/HF. \nSamples 1 and 2 both produced extremely abundant miospores which are light to dark \nbrown in color (Plate 1). Representatives of the spore genera Spelaeotriletes and \nVallatisporites are especially common, and both samples also contain a significant \nnumber of undescribed taxa. Acritarchs, which are significantly lighter in color \ncompared to the miospores, are also present in relatively low proportions. Dark wood \nfragments also occur in moderate numbers. Precise interpretation of the age of the \nsamples is difficult in the absence of a published biozonation for the Mississippian in \nNorth America. Coleman and Clayton (1987) have investigated an extended \nMississippian section exposed along Interstate Highway 64 between Lexington and \nMorehead, Kentucky which provides the only reliable local database. The Interstate \nHighway 64 study provides the best available correlation between palynomorph \nasemblages and the standard North American chronostratigraphic scheme, in addition \n 7\nto suggested correlations with the western European palynozonation scheme for the \nMississippian (Clayton et al., 1977). \nAlthough there are no consistent preservational differences between \ncomponents in either of the two assemblages, it is clear that they contain both in-situ \nand reworked components. The youngest (i.e. in-situ) association is dominated by \nSpelaeotriletes balteatus and Spelaeotriletes pretiosus, together with Acanthotriletes \nacritarchus, Acanthotriletes macrogaleatus, Acanthotriletes persibus, \nBaculatisporites fusticulus, Camptotriletes prionotus, Colatisporites decorus, \nConvolutispora major, Neoraistrickia logani, Raistrickia condylosa, Raistrickia \nstrumosa, Vallatisporites ciliaris, and Verrucosisporites irregularis. This association \ncompares closely with those reported by Coleman and Clayton (1987) from the \ninterval of the Borden Formation between the uppermost part of the Henley and \nCowbell members. An early Osagean age was suggested for this succession, and a \ncorrelation to the Spelaeotriletes pretiosus-Raistrickia clavata (PC) miospore Biozone \nof Clayton et al. (1977) in western Europe was proposed. However, a latest \nKinderhookian age for the section cannot be precluded because a palynologically \nbarren interval in the lower part of the Henley Member, which may contain the \nKinderhookian-Osagean boundary, was encountered in the Interstate 64 section. \nThe older, reworked, association in both samples represents a small percentage \nof the total palynofloras, but was identified by the presence of Apiculiretusispora \nfructicosa, Emphanisporites annulatus, Hymenozonotriletes explanatus, Retispora \nlepidophyta, Retispora lepidophyta var. minor, and Vallatisporites pusillites. The \ndistinctive association of Retispora lepidophyta and Vallatisporites pusillites is a \ncharacteristic component of latest Devonian and earliest Mississippian assemblages in \nEurope and North America, and has been previously reported from the Bedford Shale \nin Ohio and Kentucky (Winslow, 1962; Molyneux et al., 1984, Coleman and Clayton, \n1987; Clayton et al. 1998). This association, which is accompanied by several Late \nDevonian-Early Mississippian acritarchs including Gorgonisphaeridium, \nLeiosphaeridia, Multiplicisphaeridium, Umbellisphaeridium, and Veryhachium, is \nconsidered to be present in the Portsmouth Shale due to reworking of material from an \nolder Bedford Shale source. Both assemblages contain a further group of long ranging \ntaxa including Auroraspora macra, Retusotriletes  incohatus, Spinozonotriletes  \nuncatus, Verrucosisporites  nitidus, Vallatisporites vallatus, and Vallatisporites \nverrucosus, which have been previously reported throughout the Lower Mississippian \n(Coleman and Clayton, 1987; Clayton et al., 1998). \nThere are no differences in the diversity and relative proportions in the \nsubsamples prepared using the H2O2 and (NaPO3)6 methods. It is clear that both \nprovide fully representative associations. The majority of the spores are well-\npreserved, however, some specimens appear to be somewhat degraded. These pale \nand degraded spores appear to be more prevalent in the material prepared using H2O2 \n(Plate 1, fig. 1). Furthermore, the rare acritarchs are most common in the (NaPO3)6 \npreparations. The presence of significant numbers of apparently degraded spores, and \nthe virtual lack of acritarchs, in the H2O2 preparations may be a result of the effects of \noxidation by H2O2. In samples 1 and 2, the palynomorph concentrations are 4,080 and \n2,830 grains per gram respectively with the H2O2 method (Table 1). The (NaPO3)6 \nmethod produced significantly sparser associations, 835 and 390 grains per gram \nrespectively (Table 1). For sample 1 prepared with H2O2, this figure was calculated as \nfollows. A total of 408 palynomorphs were counted using 0.05 ml from a total of 5 ml \nof homogenised aqueous organic residue prepared from 10 g of sample. This gives a \nfigure of 4,080 palynomorphs per gram. All the other quantitative calculations in this \n 8\nstudy were made using this method. It is clear from the nature of the palynofloras \nproduced from samples 1 and 2 using the two non-acid methods that both techniques \ncan effectively extract palynomorphs from moderately well lithified claystones that \nare inherently palynologically rich. In this case, is possible that the H2O2 method \ncauses some palynomorph damage and degradation. However, this method produced a \nsignificantly higher palynomorph concentration than the (NaPO3)6 procedure (Table \n1). This is thought to be because the H2O2 method is more effective at breaking down \nthe lithified rock matrix than (NaPO3)6. \n \n \nThe Upper Carboniferous (Westphalian) of British Geological Survey offshore \nborehole at site 74\/13, east of Fife Ness, Forth Approaches, offshore Scotland, \nU.K. (sample 3; H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparation methods, both quantitative) \n \nA single sample of mudstone, number 3, was collected at 18.07 m from this \nshallow (77.00 m), cored offshore borehole. It was drilled in 1974 as part of a major \nBGS offshore geological mapping project, and is mentioned in Institute of Geological \nSciences (1975, p. 24) and Owens and Marshall (1978, p. 19). The site lies \nimmediately east of Fife Ness, southeast Scotland, and was illustrated in Owens and \nMarshall (1978, text-fig. 3). The borehole penetrated till and shelly sand of \nQuaternary age to 17.00 m, prior to coring 60.00 m of interbedded coal seams, \nmudstones, sandstones, and siltstones of Late Carboniferous (Westphalian B) age. \nSample 3, which is known to be palynologically rich, was prepared using \nH2O2 and HCl\/HF.  Both preparations yielded exceptionally abundant and well-\npreserved miospores which are mid to dark brown in color (Plate 2).  Spores are \nmarkedly more abundant than pollen, and microplankton is entirely absent. Relatively \nlow proportions of wood fragments are also present. The sample yielded a well \npreserved, typical middle Pennsylvanian-Duckmantian (late Bashkirian-early \nMoscovian or Atokan) miospore assemblage dominated by approximately 80% \nLycospora pusilla with common Crassispora and Florinites. The presence of the \nindex species Endosporites globiformis and Florinites junior indicates assignment to \nthe Microreticulatisporites nobilis-Florinites junior (NJ) Biozone of Clayton et al. \n(1977). This is supported by the presence of characteristic components of the NJ \nBiozone including Cirratriradites saturni, Cristatisporites indignabundus, \nGrumosisporites varioreticulatus, Raistrickia fulva, Raistrickia saetosa, Raistrickia \nsuperba, Reinschospora triangularis, Simozonotriletes intortus, Triquitrites \nbransonii, Triquitrites sinani, Vestispora cancellata, and Vestispora costata. \nThere are no differences in either diversity or relative proportions between the \nH2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations. Furthermore, absolutely no damage or degradation of \nthe palynomorphs due to oxidation effects were observed in the H2O2 preparation \n(Plate 2). The HCl\/HF preparation was not oxidized, and it contains significant levels \nof amorphous organic material (AOM) (Plate 2, fig. 2). This extraneous material \ncould be readily eliminated by a brief wash with nitric acid (HNO3). The reason for \nthe H2O2 preparation being clear of AOM in this study (Plate 2, fig. 1) is that this was \noxidized during the maceration with H2O2. Consistency in not separately oxidizing the \nresidues was maintained throughout this study in order to be able to make objective \ncomparisons of the H2O2 and the HCl\/HF methods. The simultaneous breaking down \nof the matrix and the oxidation of the AOM by H2O2 is an extremely useful property, \nexcept in kerogen\/palynofacies studies. However, if the palynomorphs are potentially \nsusceptible to oxidation, they may be damaged. \n 9\nThe quantitative analyses of the two preparation methods gave significantly \ndifferent results. The H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations yielded 2,994 and 54,600 grains \nper gram respectively (Table 1). The H2O2 method did not break the entire rock \nsample down, explaining the marked disparity in yield. Non-acid techniques are \nknown to be somewhat less effective in the breakdown of relatively hard and \nindurated sedimentary rocks (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2006). In the non-acid \nmethods, ions of the reagent are adsorbed, and this disaggregates the clays due to the \nhigh ionic charges. The disaggregation effect is significantly less effective on hard \nclaystones, than it is on soft, unconsolidated clays. This disparity in the different \neffectiveness of H2O2 and HCl\/HF in breaking down the bulk of the sediment matrix \nis not a serious problem in highly palynomorph-rich material such as sample 3. In rich \nmaterial such as sample 3, the H2O2 method will demonstrably extract sufficient \nmaterial for study which is apparently representative of the sample (Plate 2, fig. 1). \nShould the sample material be less rich in palynomorphs, the sample could be \nrepeatedly macerated in stronger H2O2 in order to extract workable palynofloras. It is \npossible that the H2O2 method can be adapted to be more effective in the breakdown \nof the rock matrix provided a method can be found of softening it prior to H2O2 \ntreatment. \n \n \nThe Grantham Formation (Aalenian, Middle Jurassic) of the BGS Copper Hill \nBorehole, near Ancaster, Lincolnshire, England (samples 4 and 5; H2O2 and \nHCl\/HF preparation methods, both quantitative) \n \nTwo samples, numbers 4 and 5, were prepared from this stratigraphic borehole \ndrilled during early 1991 at Copper Hill Quarry, near Ancaster, Lincolnshire, central \nEngland (NGR SK 9787 4265). This borehole was drilled in order to prove the \nMiddle and Lower Lias succession of the Grantham area. It is 202.11 m deep, and \ncored a succession from the Scunthorpe Mudstone Formation (Lower Sinemurian) to \nthe Lower Lincolnshire Limestone Formation (Aalenian) (Berridge et al., 1999, text-\nfigs. 19-21). The Copper Hill Borehole and the BGS Walks Farm Borehole (Berridge \net al., 1999, text-figs. 22, 24) provide an important Jurassic reference section \napproximately 320 m thick for the East Midlands Shelf.  Samples 4 and 5 (5.10-5.20 \nand 7.00 m respectively) are from a mudstone unit within the Grantham Formation, \nwhich is of Aalenian age (Murchisonae Chronozone) (Berridge et al., 1999, table 7). \nThey are known to yield rich and well-preserved associations of pollen and spores \nwith associated wood and plant fragments (Riding, 1992). \n The H2O2 and the HCl\/HF preparations both yielded identical abundant \npalynomorphs which are mid brown in color (Table 1, Plate 3). No diversity or \nabundance differences were observed. Gymnospermous pollen and pteridophytic \nspores are present in subequal proportions. Both samples are also rich in wood and \nother plant material; AOM is absent. The pollen and spores observed from samples 4 \nand 5 include bisaccate pollen, Baculatisporites comaumensis, Callialasporites \ndampieri, Callialasporites microvelatus, Callialasporites turbatus, Cibotiumspora \njuriensis, Classopollis classoides, Concavissimisporites verrucosus, Coronatispora \nvaldensis, Cyathidites spp., Duplexisporites problematicus, Gleicheniidites \nsenomicus, Ischysporites variegatus, Leptolepidites spp., Perinopollenites elatoides, \nRetitriletes austroclavatidites, Todisporites spp., Uvaesporites argentiformis, and \nVitreisporites pallidus. This pollen\/spore association is typical of the paralic \nAalenian-Bathonian facies in the Middle Jurassic of northwest Europe (Srivastava, \n 10\n1987; Riding et al., 1991). The freshwater\/brackish alga Botryococcus braunii is also \npresent. \nThe taxa present appeared to be entirely unaffected by either of the preparation \nmethods.  Specifically, the palynomorphs in the H2O2 preparation show absolutely no \nevidence of damage or degradation effects (Plate 3, fig. 1). However, it is possible \nthat the H2O2 oxidized some of the light plant tissue (Plate 3). Quantitative analyses \nof the two preparation methods gave remarkably similar results.  Sample 4 yielded \n6,560 and 7,370 grains per gram with the H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations respectively \n(Table 1). Using the H2O2 and HCl\/HF procedures, sample 5 produced 8,170 and \n8,250 grains per gram respectively (Table 1).  Both methods readily broke the entire \nrock sample down, and this explains the similar palynomorph concentrations and \nspectra.  The fact that H2O2 is equally effective as HCl\/HF confirms that the non-acid \ntechniques are viable alternatives to mineral acids for lightly or moderately indurated \nclay-rich sample material (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2004; 2006). \n \n \nThe uppermost L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation (Danian, Lower Paleogene) of \nSeymour Island, northern Antarctic Peninsula (sample 6: H2O2, (NaPO3)6, and \nHCl\/HF preparation methods, all quantitative; sample 7; H2O2, and HCl\/HF \npreparation methods, both quantitative) \n \nSamples 6 and 7, from the uppermost L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation from \nsouth-central Seymour Island, offshore northeast Antarctic Peninsula were selected \nfor this study. The samples were taken from measured section D5 229, which was part \nof a major sampling progam of the entire L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation of southern \nSeymour Island (Thorn et al., 2007). The location of the measured section D5 229, \nand a summary sedimentological log, were illustrated by Thorn et al. (2007, text-figs. \n3, 4). The L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation of the Marambio Group is of Maastrichtian \nto Danian age, and outcrops in the upper part of a back-arc basin fill which represents \nan extensive regressive megasequence (Pirrie et al., 1992; Crame et al., 2004). The \ntwo samples are from immediately above the Maastrichtian-Danian (K\/T) boundary, \nclose to the boundary with the overlying Sobral Formation. Samples 6 and 7 represent \nacmes of the dinoflagellate cysts Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum and Spinidinium sp. \nrespectively. These distinctive, stratigraphically restricted \u2018flood\u2019 occurrences were \ninterpreted as representing restricted inshore-estuarine paleoenvironments, or settings \nwhere a single taxon invaded a vacant ecological niche (Askin, 1988a,b). Given that \nthe paleoenvironment probably was significantly disrupted by the effects of the K\/T \nimpact event, it seems most likely that these acmes represent opportunistic forms \nwhich recolonised devastated habitats. The reason for choosing these closely related \ntwo dinoflagellate cyst acmes was to test the contention of Williams et al. (2005) that \nH2O2 destroys certain peridiniacean dinoflagellate cyst taxa such as Palaeoperidinium \npyrophorum. Hence, assuming that Spinidinium is not adversely affected by H2O2, \nsample 7 acts as a control. The L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation is known to be \npalynologically rich (Riding et al., 1992).  Sample 6 was prepared using the H2O2, \n(NaPO3)6, and HCl\/HF methods so that the two non-acid procedures could be directly \ncompared because of the potential damage to Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum using \nH2O2. By contrast, sample 7 was prepared using the H2O2 and HCl\/HF procedures. \n \nSample 6. This sample yielded an extremely abundant palynoflora. The assemblage is \noverwhelmingly dominated by the dinoflagellate cyst Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum \n 11\n(Plate 4). Other dinoflagellate cysts are present in relatively low proportions and \ninclude Cassidium fragile, Eisenackia circumtabulata, Hystrichosphaeridium \nsalpingophorum, Senegalinium obscurum, and Trithyrodinium evittii. This \nassemblage is clearly within the Early Paleogene (Danian) dinoflagellate cyst zone 5 \nof Askin (1988a). The freshwater\/brackish alga Botryococcus braunii was also \nobserved in relatively small numbers. Palambages is also present, together with \npollen and spores including Azolla sp., bisaccate pollen, Cyathidites spp., \nLaevigatosporites spp., Microcachryidites antarcticus, Nothofagidites spp., \nPeninsulapollis truswelliae, Proteacidites spp., Retitriletes austroclavatidites, and \nStereisporites spp. The pollen-spore association is similar to those documented by \nAskin (1990a,b) from the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island. \n The H2O2, (NaPO3)6, and HCl\/HF preparations proved significantly different, \nin terms of palynomorph productivity and content. The three methods produced 3,575, \n11,700, and 22,700 palynomorphs per gram of sediment respectively (Table 1). \nDespite the concentration differences between them, the (NaPO3)6 and HCl\/HF \npreparations are identical in terms of general appearance, preservational state, and \nabundance\/diversity (Plate 4). It is, however clear that the HCl\/HF method is \nsignificantly more effective at extracting palynomorphs from this sediment in terms of \ngrains per gram. The acid method produced approximately double the numbers of \npalynomorphs than the (NaPO3)6 method (Table 1). Furthermore, the H2O2 \npreparation proved richer in resistant mineral grains than the other preparations. The \nmost important finding here is that Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum is entirely absent \nfrom the H2O2 residue. The residues produced with the HCl\/HF and (NaPO3)6 \nmethods produced superabundant Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum, and this taxon \ndominates the assemblage (Plate 4). However, the slides from the 30% H2O2 \nprocedure proved entirely devoid of this distinctive dinoflagellate cyst, hence the \noxidizing effects of H2O2 have destroyed all the specimens of Palaeoperidinium \npyrophorum. This confirms the findings of Williams et al. (2005, p. 220), who found \nthat Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum is destroyed in certain samples by 3-12% H2O2. It \nis clear that a reduced concentration of H2O2 will not destroy at least some of the \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum specimens (see Williams et al., 2005, text-figs. 6, 7), \nbut these authors did not state this figure, or the range of concentrations. In this study, \nthe standard H2O2 concentration (i.e. 30%) was used on sample 6 in order to directly \ncompare with the other samples herein. Recent peridiniacean dinoflagellate cysts are \nknown to be more prone to damage by oxidation in comparison to gonyaulacalean \nforms (Dale, 1976; Head, 1996). This situation, however, is not always the case. By \ncontrast, Dodsworth (1995) found that the prolonged oxidation of Cretaceous residues \nwith Schulze\u2019s solution and alkali selectively and progressively destroyed \ngonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts. The peridiniacean dinoflagellate cyst taxa \nremained unaffected. Because of the findings of Dale (1976), most workers on \nQuaternary dinoflagellate cysts do not oxidize at all during preparation (e.g. Harland, \n1989). In particular, it is well known that dinoflagellate cysts belonging to the \nSubfamily Congruentidioideae are highly susceptible to oxidation during processing \n(Head, 1996). For example, the genus Brigantedinium is extremely prone to \ndestruction by even low levels of oxidation with H2O2 (Hopkins and McCarthy, \n2002). It therefore appears that certain taxa throughout the Suborder Peridiniineae are \nprone to destruction by oxidation. However, although H2O2 destroys \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum, there is clearly significant variation because the \nperidinialean taxa Senegalinium obscurum and Trithyrodinium evittii are both present \nin the H2O2 preparation. These taxa belong to the Subfamily Deflandreoideae \n 12\n(Fensome et al., 1993). It is possible that Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum is especially \nsusceptible to destruction via oxidation is because it is highly unusual in forming \nexterior to the dinoflagellate theca (Evitt et al., 1998). The dinosporin chemistry \nhence may be different to conventional dinoflagellate cysts, which form inside the \ntheca. The destruction of such an important dinoflagellate cyst taxon as \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum due to the action of H2O2 is a major disadvantage to \nthis method. The range top of this species is a reliable marker for the mid Thanetian \n(Powell, 1992). The strength of the H2O2, and the duration of the exposure should be \ntested using similar material so that a tolerance level can be formulated. \n The remainder of the palynoflora appears to be entirely unaffected, although \nsome pale relatively poorly-preserved palynomorphs were noted in the the H2O2 \npreparation, indicating that the H2O2 did cause some limited degradation to other \npalynomorphs than Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum. Obviously, the lack of \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum in the H2O2 preparation enhances the relative \nproportions of the rarer forms. This is similar to the effect noted by Hughes et al. \n(1964) when these authors prepared some coals using strong oxidants. Hughes et al. \n(1964) found that the spore Crassispora kosankei was destroyed by Schultze\u2019s \nsolution. By contrast, Laevigatosporites spp. were found to be highly resistant and \nhence were overrepresented in overoxidized material. \n \nSample 7. This sample from Seymour Island also proved extremely rich \npalynologically. Like sample 6, a dinoflagellate cyst acme is present. The \ndinoflagellate cyst assemblage is a virtually monospecific association of a \nrepresentative of Spinidinium. This form was termed Spinidinium sp. 1 by Askin \n(1988a,b), and it overwhelmingly dominates the palynoflora (Plate 5). Other \ndinoflagellate cysts are extremely rare, and largely comprise Hystrichosphaeridium \nsalpingophorum. Botryococcus braunii is also present. Pollen and spores are also \nrelatively prominent. These are similar to those in sample 6, and are dominated by \nspores, especially Cyathidites spp. The palynoflora is also within the Early Paleogene \n(Danian) dinoflagellate cyst zone 5 of Askin (1988a). \n The H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations were both highly palynologically \nproductive. They produced 51,810 and 130,850 specimens per gram respectively \n(Table 1, Plate 5). Both methods fully broke down the sediment, and it is not known \nwhy there is such a large disparity in the palynomorph concentrations. It is possible \nthat some palynomorphs were lost in the H2O2 preparation due to non-selective \noxidation, and during sieving and other procedures. Also, there are slightly more \nmineral grains in the H2O2 preparation than the HCl\/HF residue; these may have \ndisplaced palynomorphs. Nevertheless, both these methods of preparation have \nproduced highly abundant palynomorph associations, which are identical in terms of \nspecies content and relative proportions. It is clear that the H2O2 has not selectively \ndegraded or destroyed specimens of Spinidinium (Plate 5). \n \n \nQuaternary (Late Pleistocene) clays of the BGS offshore borehole 99\/3, Faroes-\nShetland area, offshore northern Scotland (Judd Sheet) (sample 8; H2O2 and \nHCl\/HF preparation methods, both quantitative) \n \nSample 8 is from 34.22 m in a BGS offshore borehole, number 99\/3, which \ndrilled a succession of Quaternary clays offshore northern Scotland. The borehole is \nlocated at 60\u00b0 24.8133\u2019N; 04\u00b0 39.0639\u2019W. This is on the Judd Sheet, which lies \n 13\ndirectly north of Sutherland (Stoker et al., 1993, inside back cover). The Late \nPleistocene diamictons and clay-rich suspension deposits were seen to 54 m (Riding, \n2000). The reason for choosing this succession is to test the effectiveness of the H2O2 \npreparation procedure on unconsolidated marine clays. The Pleistocene of borehole \n99\/3 is known to be relatively palynologically rich (Riding, 2000). \nSample 8 was prepared using both H2O2 and HCl\/HF. Both the preparations \nyielded abundant and well-preserved indigenous and allochthonous palynomorphs. \nThe abundant reworked palynomorphs are typical of a diamicton-dominated \nsuccession. The allochthonous palynomorphs are Carboniferous, Jurassic, Lower \nCretaceous, and Paleogene (Eocene to Early Oligocene) and Quaternary dinoflagellate \ncysts are more common than Quaternary pollen (Riding, 2000). Quaternary \ndinoflagellate cysts are relatively low in diversity and include Achomosphaera \nandalousiensis, Bitectatodinium tepikiense, Brigantedinium cariacoense, \nBrigantedinium simplex, Brigantedinium spp., Impagidinium aculeatum, \nLingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium centrocarpum, and Spiniferites \nspp. The presence of Brigantedinium spp. is indicative of cold, glacial conditions with \nseasonal or permanent sea-ice (Harland, 1992). Wood fragments are common, and \nother plant tissues were also observed. There are no differences between the \ndiversities and relative abundances of the H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations, and no \ndamage to the palynomorphs due to oxidative effects of the H2O2 was observed. \nThe quantitative analyses of the two preparation methods gave markedly \nsimilar results. The H2O2 and HCl\/HF preparations yielded 7,700 and 7,600 grains per \ngram respectively (Table 1). This was the only sample in this study where the H2O2 \npreparation produced more palynomorphs than the HCl\/HF procedure. Non-acid \ntechniques are known to be effective in breaking down soft, unconsolidated clay-rich \nsediments (Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2006; Riding et al., 2006). \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis demonstration of a reliable palynomorph preparation procedure using hot \nH2O2 clearly indicates that the use of mineral acid digestion is not needed in all cases. \nFive case studies were undertaken, comprising eight samples of Early Carboniferous \nto Quaternary age from Antarctica, the U.K., and the U.S.A. The samples were \nprepared quantitatively using H2O2 and also with HCl\/HF and\/or (NaPO3)6 in order to \nprovide absolute frequency data that are directly comparable. It is clear from this \nstudy that disaggregation using H2O2, together with density separation, oxidation etc., \nwhere necessary, can effectively separate and concentrate palynomorphs from a \nvariety of clay-rich lithologies. \nIn the Early Carboniferous samples 1 and 2, the H2O2 method was \nsignificantly more effective than the (NaPO3)6 procedure. However some \npalynomorphs extracted using H2O2 appear to have been degraded. Sample 3, which \nis Late Carboniferous, was prepared effectively using both H2O2 and HCl\/HF, \nhowever the palynomorph concentration is much higher in the HCl\/HF preparation. \nHowever the H2O2 method produced a residue clear of AOM. Samples 3 and 4 are \nfrom a Middle Jurassic paralic deposit and the palynofloras are comparable in terms \nof both taxonomic content and yield with both the H2O2 and the HCl\/HF preparations. \nTwo samples, 6 and 7, are from Danian unconsolidated siliciclastic sediments. These \nsamples represent two different dinoflagellate cyst acmes. The 30% H2O2 totally \ndestroyed Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum in sample 6, but did not affect Spinidinium \n 14\nsp. in sample 7. The H2O2 and the HCl\/HF methods produced similar palynofloras in \nsample 7, which is a Quaternary clay. \nIn the majority of the samples studied, the HCl\/HF technique produced a \nsignificantly greater concentration of palynomorphs than either of the non-acid \nprotocols. The H2O2 method is less effective than HCl\/HF in disaggregating relatively \nhard, indurated sedimentary rocks such as sample 3. However, the H2O2 procedure \nappears to be more effective that the (NaPO3)6 method for indurated claystones. \nNevertheless, in most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic samples, the palynomorph yields \nof the H2O2 and HCl\/HF methods are broadly comparable. Therefore, for both non-\nacid techniques, the possibility of pre-treating sample material so that it is made \nsignificantly softer than in the raw state should be investigated. Potential reagents for \nthis include strong detergents and\/or organic solvents. \nHydrogen peroxide can degrade or damage palynomorphs, and evidence of \nthis was noted in samples 1, 2 and 6. In sample 6, the 30% H2O2 was found to \ncompletely destroy the dominant species, the dinoflagellate cyst Palaeoperidinium \npyrophorum. By contrast, the HCl\/HF and (NaPO3)6 procedures both did not \nadversely affect Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum in this sample. However, the \noxidizing effects of H2O2 can sometimes be useful. For example in sample 3, the \nH2O2 method produced a palynomorph assemblage that was cleaner in terms of the \nlevels of extraneous AOM than the residue produced by the acid digestion method. \nThe H2O2 method has the marked advantage of its capability to macerate the matrix \nand to oxidize the AOM simultaneously. \n Despite the fact that H2O2 often frequently cannot fully disaggregate indurated \nlithotypes, if the sample material is abundant in palynomorphs, this method will \nnormally produce abundant and workable associations. It appears to be more effective \nthan (NaPO3)6 for preparing relatively lithified samples. However, if the sample \nmaterial is relatively soft and contains palynomorphs susceptible to oxidation, such as \nsample 6, the (NaPO3)6 technique is frequently just as effective. Hence if a non-acid \nmethod is required, H2O2 and (NaPO3)6 should be used on hard and soft sediments \nrespectively. Further tests should be done on representative material using both H2O2 \nand (NaPO3)6 to determine which non-acid preparation method is most effective. \nAdditionally, more investigations should be undertaken using various concentrations \nof H2O2 to further prove its effectiveness in palynological processing. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis contribution was funded by the BGS laboratory maintenance and \ndevelopment of capability project managed by Shaun Reeder (BGS, Keyworth).

Description of the new palynological processing technique using \nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2). \n \n1 The sample is gently crushed to fragments 1000 \u00b5m\/1 mm in maximum \ndiameter; unconsolidated material is gently broken up. \n2 The crushed\/broken up sample material is placed in a large (ca. 22 cm \ndiameter) ceramic dish. \n3 A few drops of H2O2 are added to the cold sample material, to test for a \nviolent reaction. \n4 The ceramic dish is placed on a hot plate that has been pre-heated to ca. 100 \n\u02daC in a fume hood. \n5 The sample is heated on the hot plate for 1 minute. \n6 The sample material is covered with 15% to 30% H2O2, and left to heat for 10 \nminutes with the hot plate switched on. The concentration of the H2O2 is \ndependent upon the level of induration of the rock. The 30% H2O2 is only \nnecessary for the hardest of sedimentary rocks and, if the sample material is \nrelatively unidurated, significantly lower concentrations of H2O2 can be used. \n7 The sample residue is then taken off the hot plate and diluted with ca. 250 ml \nof cold distilled water. The disaggregated sample material then floats, and is \ncarefully decanted into a large (ca. 2-3 liter) beaker. This beaker contains \nsome cold distilled water to further dilute the H2O2. Care should be taken if \nthe oxidizing reaction is still proceeding. \n8 Replace the ceramic dish onto the hot plate and repeat this process as many \ntimes as necessary, leaving the sample for longer than 10 minutes if \nneccessary. \n9 Swirl and\/or centrifuge or the residue to separate any resistant mineral grains \nand the organic fraction. \n10 Any remaining extraneous AOM can be destroyed using oxidation followed \nby alkali treatment. \n11 The washed residue is then stained if necessary, and concentrated by sieving \nusing an appropriate mesh (normally between 10-15 \u00b5m). \n12 The concentrated residue is mounted on microscope slides. \n \n \nAPPENDIX 2.

For scale, \nwhich applies to both photomicrographs, the polygonomorph acritarch at the top \ncenter of fig. 2 is 127 \u03bcm in length. Both photomicrographs were taken using plain \ntransmitted light. Note the overall similarity of these two non-acid preparations. \n \n1 the H2O2 preparation, note the relatively abundant, well-preserved miospores, \nwith occasional acritarchs. The slightly degraded spore at the center-right may \nhave been oxidized by the H2O2. BGS Slide MPA 55798\/2\/H2O2\/non-\nquantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate N67\/3. \n \n2 the (NaPO3)6 preparation, note the relatively abundant, well-preserved \nmiospores, with occasional acritarchs. BGS Slide MPA 55798\/2\/hexa\/non-\nquantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate J60\/3. \n \n \nPLATE 2 \n \nA comparison of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the mineral acid (HCl\/HF) \npreparation techniques on sample 3 from the Upper Carboniferous of offshore \nScotland. For scale, which applies to both photomicrographs, the saccate pollen grain \nin the center of fig. 1 is 82 \u03bcm in length. Both photomicrographs were taken using \nplain transmitted light. Note the absence and presence of AOM in figs. 1 and 2 \nrespectively.  It therefore appears that the H2O2 simultaneously macerates the rock \n 25\nmatrix and oxidizes the AOM. The HCl\/HF preparation (fig. 2) was not separately \noxidized. \n \n1 the H2O2 preparation, note the abundant, well-preserved miospores which are \ndominated by Lycospora pusilla. The residue is extremely \u2018clean\u2019; the \nmiospores are free of AOM. BGS Slide CSA 1231\/H2O2\/quantitative, \n\u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate L70\/4. \n \n2 the HCl\/HF preparation, again, note the abundant, well-preserved miospores, \ndominated by Lycospora pusilla. This preparation was not separately oxidized \nand note the relatively abundant AOM. The AOM partially obscures the \nmiospores, note the prominent specimen of Raistrickia in the center of the \nfield of view which is partially occluded by AOM.

Both photomicrographs were taken using plain \ntransmitted light. Note the relatively abundant miospores in both preparations, and the \nabundant plant tissue in the HCl\/HF preparation (fig. 2). It is possible that significant \nproportions of the lighter plant tissues have been oxidized in the H2O2 preparation \n(fig. 1). \n \n1 the H2O2 preparation, note the relatively abundant miospores, including the \nsaccate pollen Callialasporites, and the clean nature of the residue. BGS slide \nMPA 36320\/3\/H2O2\/quantiattive, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate P72\/2. \n \n2 the HCl\/HF preparation, note the relatively abundant pollen and spores, \nincluding Callialasporites and Cyathidites, and the abundant plant tissue. BGS \nslide MPA 36320\/3\/HCl-HF\/quantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate Q50. \n \n \nPLATE 4 \n \nA comparison of the sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaPO3)6] and the mineral acid \n(HCl\/HF) preparation techniques on sample 6 from the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano \nFormation (Danian, Lower Paleocene) of Seymour Island, Antarctica. For scale, \nwhich applies to both photomicrographs, the specimen of the dinoflagellate cyst \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum at the bottom left of fig. 1 is 82 \u03bcm in length. Both \nphotomicrographs were taken using plain transmitted light. Note the abundant levels \nof Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum, and the overall similarity of these two preparations. \nThe H2O2 preparation is not illustrated here; the abundant specimens of \nPalaeoperidinium pyrophorum have apparently been oxidized by the 30% H2O2. \n \n 26\n1 the (NaPO3)6 preparation, note the relatively abundant, well-preserved \nspecimens of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum, with occasional other taxa such \nas Hystrichosphaeridium salpingophorum at the center right. BGS slide MPA \n56193\/1\/(NaPO3)6\/non-quantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate P63\/1. \n \n2 the HCl\/HF preparation, note the abundant, specimens of Palaeoperidinium \npyrophorum well-preserved miospores, with moderate levels of plant tissue. \nBGS slide MPA 56193\/3\/hexa\/quantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate \nM52\/3. \n \n \nPLATE 5 \n \nA comparison of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the mineral acid (HCl\/HF) \npreparation techniques on sample 7 from the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation (Danian, \nLower Paleocene) of Seymour Island, Antarctica. The assemblage is overwhelmingly \ndominated by the Spinidinium sp., which is a pale, biconical, proximate dinoflagellate \ncyst. Note the overall similarity of the two preparations. Note that plant tissue is \nsignificantly more common in the HCl\/HF preparation (fig. 2). It is therefore possible \nthat some of the non-woody plant tissues have been oxidized in the H2O2 preparation \n(fig. 1). For scale, which applies to both photomicrographs, the abundant \nrepresentatives of Spinidinium are typically between 40-47 \u03bcm long and 27-33 \u03bcm \nwide. Both photomicrographs were taken using phase contrast illumination. \n \n1 the H2O2 preparation, note the abundant representatives of Spinidinium. BGS \nslide MPA 56194\/3\/H2O2\/quantitative, \u2018England Finder\u2019coordinate Q53\/1. \n \n2 the HCl\/HF preparation, again note the abundant Spinidinium spp., a small \nbiconical dinoflagellate cyst.
