INTRODUCTION\nScaling of electronic devices requires both the reduction\nof all the physical dimensions, including junction depth pro-\nfile, and high levels of active dopant concentration. Highly\nactive, shallow, and steep doping profile can be obtained by\nusing preamorphized implants prior to dopant implantation\nand annealing at low temperature, exploiting the solid phase\nepitaxial regrowth \u0001SPER\u0002 process.1 It is well known that, as\na consequence of the amorphized implant, an excess of Si\ninterstitials forms just beyond the amorphous\/crystalline in-\nterface in the end-of-range \u0001EOR\u0002 region. During subsequent\nannealing these defects evolve through the formation\/\ndissolution of aggregates and the release of free\nself-interstitials.1\u20134 This interstitial supersaturation causes\nunwanted phenomena like transient-enhanced diffusion\n\u0001TED\u0002, point defects clusters, and clustering between point\ndefects and dopant with consequent electrical deactivation.1,2\nA great advantage of the amorphization and SPER\nmethod is the possibility of using a low annealing tempera-\nture for a short time. Under these experimental conditions,\nseveral mechanisms such as diffusion in amorphous Si \u0001Ref.\n5\u0002 and uphill diffusion6\u201313 influence the dopant redistribution\nand activation. In particular, the surface \u0001and the interfaces\u0002\naffect the impurity profile through both the segregation and\ntrapping of dopant atoms in energetically favorable places\nand acting on point defects distribution, and consequently, on\nthe TED phenomena. These effects are particularly evident\nfor boron6\u20139 and phosphorous,10,11 but have been also evi-\ndenced in ultrashallow junctions obtained by low-energy ar-\nsenic implantation.12,13\nA preferential diffusion of boron at high concentrations\ntoward the surface against the concentration gradient has\nbeen recently observed by Wang et al.6 after ultralow-energya\u0002Electronic mail: ferri@bo.imm.cnr.it\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 102, 103707 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/102\u000210\u0001\/103707\/6\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics102, 103707-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Shima et al.7\nquantitatively investigated how boron segregates to regions\nclose to the surface and concluded that the pileup is mainly\nconfined within 0.6 nm of the Si side of the SiO2 \/Si inter-\nface. Duffy et al.8 reported that the effect is enhanced by the\npreamorphization of the substrate and it increases with de-\ncreasing depth of the amorphous layer.\nThe physical mechanism of the uphill diffusion is still\ncontroversial. Some authors ascribe the preferential migra-\ntion toward the surface during the postimplantation anneal-\ning to the locally steep concentration gradient of\ninterstitials.8,10,14 Alternative explanations are based on inter-\nface trapping,13,15 band bending,16 elastic stress,17\u201319 and seg-\nregation in front of the amorphous\/crystalline interface dur-\ning the solid phase epitaxial regrowth.20,21 However, besides\nunderstanding the mechanisms responsible for this anoma-\nlous behavior, knowledge of the dopant distribution in prox-\nimity of the surface and the availability of simulation codes\nable to predict dopant evolution during postimplantation an-\nnealing are important tools for the design and performance of\nmodern electronic devices. At present, commercial simula-\ntors have proven inadequate for even qualitative predictions\nof the boron pileup phenomena at the surface\/interface.5\nLately interest in silicon-on-insulator \u0001SOI\u0002 technology\nhas strongly increased due to the expected superior perfor-\nmance and fabrication advantages of this material with re-\nspect to those of bulk silicon.22 As far as the diffusion phe-\nnomenon is concerned, the presence in the SOI samples of a\nburied Si \/SiO2 interface provides another efficient sink for\nthe interstitials besides the silicon surface. This second sink\nmodifies the distribution of point defects during annealing\nand consequently, the unwanted effects related to these\ndefects.23 The advantages of the use of SOI with respect to\nbulk samples regarding electrical activation and TED reduc-\ntion have been explored in recent papers.24\u201326\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate the uphill dif-\nfusion in ultrashallow p+ \/n junctions obtained by low-energy\nboron \u0001B\u0002 implantation in both bulk Si and SOI material. In\nparticular, the dependence of this phenomenon on the im-\nplanted dose, depth of the amorphous layer, and annealing\nconditions has been analyzed with the support of a simula-\ntion program which takes into account dopant trapping at the\nsurface and allows a satisfactory prediction of the dopant\nredistribution upon annealing. It is interesting that due to the\nlow energy of the B implantation, most of the dopant before\nannealing is located at a distance from the surface of the\norder of the mean projected path length, \u0002, i.e., the average\ndistance of migration of the moving species \u0001dopant-defect\npair\u0002 before its dissociation.27\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe experiments were performed on \u0001100\u0002-oriented,\nn-type Czochralski \u0001CZ\u0002 silicon wafers with resistivity 10\n\u221225 \u0003 cm, and on SOI wafers with 55-nm-thick, p-type Si\noverlayers obtained by wafer bonding technology\n\u0001SOITEC\u00a9\u0002. Ge preamorphizing implants \u0001PAIs\u0002 were used\nto produce amorphous layers of different depths. The\nsamples were implanted to a dose of 1\u00011015 cm\u22122 at ener-\ngies of 8, 20, and 25 keV in order to amorphize the silicon to\ndepths of about, 20, 40, and 45 nm, respectively.28 The speci-\nmens were subsequently B implanted at 500 eV to doses of\n2\u00011013, 2\u00011014, and 2\u00011015 cm\u22122. Thermal treatments\nwere performed using a Process Products Corporation 18-\nlamp rapid thermal processing \u0001RTP\u0002 annealer in nitrogen\natmosphere at temperatures between 700 and 1100 \u00b0C for\ndifferent times between 5 s and 4 h. Care was taken in order\nto have the same annealing temperature both in SOI and bulk\nSi during annealing performed with a lamp heating system.\nTo monitor the temperature in the annealer, we used a k-type\nthermocouple attached to the bottom of a 5-in. Si support\nwafer and the samples to be annealed were placed on top of\nthis support wafer. From the comparison of the regrowth rate\nof the amorphous layer we found that the bulk Si samples\nexperienced about 3 \u00b0C higher temperature than the SOI\nspecimens. This is within the uncertainties of the techniques\nused.\nSecondary ion mass spectroscopy \u0001SIMS\u0002 depth profiles\nwere performed using a CAMECA Sc-Ultra mass spectrom-\neter. An oblique incidence \u000168\u00b0\u0002 500 eV O2+ primary beam\nwas used and positive secondary ions were collected. A con-\ntrolled oxygen leak was introduced in the analysis chamber\nand the sample underwent a rotation during sputtering in\norder to obtain a suitable depth resolution and sensitivity.29\nHowever, it is known that SIMS measurements could be af-\nfected by artifacts in proximity of the surface. This can cause\nsome inaccuracies to the depth scale and concentration cali-\nbration in the first couple of nanometers.30\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Simulation model of the B diffusion\nAt present the commercial codes for process simulation\ndo not take into account the phenomenon of the dopant\npileup toward the surface. This gives rise to a relevant over-\nestimation of the junction depth in the cases of very shallow\nimplants.13 In this work the simulations of the diffused pro-\nfiles are performed by using a pair-diffusion model which\nconsiders unpaired point defects and dopant-defect pairs as\nmobile species and the unpaired dopant on lattice sites as\nimmobile species. A dopant atom cannot diffuse on its own,\nbut it needs the presence of a point defect \u0001silicon self-\ninterstitials in different charge states for the case of B\u0002 in the\nnear neighborhood as a diffusion vehicle. The electrochemi-\ncal potential of the pairs is the driving force for the pair flux.\nHigh-dose Ge implantation causes the amorphization of\nthe implanted region and an excess of Si interstitials just\nbeyond the amorphous\/crystalline interface in the EOR re-\ngion. During subsequent annealing processes the amorphous\nlayer epitaxially recrystallizes very quickly, while the EOR\ndefects aggregate to form first small interstitial clusters, then\n\u0005311\u0006 complexes and dislocation loops.2\u20134 The recrystalliza-\ntion of the amorphized regions is assumed to occur instanta-\nneously, and the as-implanted distribution, as measured by\nSIMS, is used as initial profile in the simulations. The im-\nplantation damage is represented by an interstitial distribu-\ntion located immediately beyond the amorphous layer. The\ninterstitials above the solubility value at the annealing tem-\n103707-2 Ferri et al. J. Appl. Phys. 102, 103707 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Cluster for-\nmation is assumed to occur before the start of the diffusion\nsimulation. Interstitial release from the clusters exponentially\nincreases with annealing temperature. The effects of cluster\ndimension, which actually increases during annealing for the\nOstwald ripening mechanism,3,4 as well as the effects of B\nsegregation on the EOR,31 were not taken into account. The\nsurfaces are considered sinks for the interstitials, i.e., the\ninterstitial concentration at the surfaces is kept constant at\nthe equilibrium value of the annealing temperature.\nTo take into account the B uphill diffusion toward the\nsurface, we introduce a \u201ctrap\u201d distribution into the Si in the\nfirst 2\u20133 nm below the Si\/gas interface. This simple approach\nallows us to strongly improve the agreements between simu-\nlation and measured profiles in a wide range of experimental\nconditions. The following reaction term has been imple-\nmented:\nBI + T\u0001\nkb\nkf\nBT + I , \u00011\u0002\nwhere the traps T, as well as the complexes BT, are immobile\nduring the diffusion process. The time evolution of such\ncomplexes can be written as follows, taking into account the\nmass action law,\n\u0003CBT\n\u0003t\n= kf\u0003CBICT \u2212 Keq\n\u22121CBT\u0004 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere Keq=kf \/kb represents the equilibrium constant of the\nreaction.\nAll the simulations are performed with an equilibrium\nconstant reaction Keq, which favors a rapid formation of the\nBT complexes, and with the trap density used as a fitting\nparameter. For SOI samples traps are also introduced in the\nburied Si \/SiO2 interface. Furthermore, for short low-\ntemperature annealings, when the EOR defects were not\ncompletely removed, traps were also associated to these de-\nfects. For all the other parameters, we refer to the default\nvalues used in Ref. 32.\nB. Comparison with the experimental profiles\nFigure 1 shows the comparison between simulated and\nSIMS profiles of Ge PAI samples at 20 keV and B-implanted\nat 2\u00011013 cm\u22122 after annealing for 60 s at various tempera-\ntures both in SOI \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 and in bulk material \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004.\nThe graphs clearly evidence the B diffusion toward the sur-\nface and the consequent pileup in the surface region. The\nsimulations are in excellent agreement with the experimental\nprofiles at high annealing temperatures, while some differ-\nences in the shape of the B distribution are present at the\nlowest temperature. However, the phenomenon of the uphill\ndiffusion is accurately described, and the amount of B col-\nlected on the surface region is correctly evaluated. This dem-\nonstrates that the evolution of the B distribution, apparently\nagainst the concentration gradient, is consistent with a Fick-\nian redistribution; in fact, the good simulation of the SIMS\nprofiles is just obtained by introducing trapping sites in prox-\nimity of the surface, without considering any asymmetric\nbehavior of the dopant movement. The presence of unsatur-\nated traps in the surface region drives the \u0003BI\u0004 pair concen-\ntration to be very small, and thus creates a huge gradient\nbetween the B profile and the traps region. This gradient, not\nvisible by SIMS but evidenced by the simulations, drives the\nphenomenon of uphill diffusion. On the contrary, simulations\nperformed without the introduction of traps near the surface\nproduce a significant overestimation of junction depth and an\nincorrect determination of the B concentration in the surface\nregion \u0001not shown\u0002.\nThe amount of B which is distributed into the Si, i.e., the\none which is not trapped at the surface, can be evaluated by\nthe SIMS profiles and on the basis of the simulations. The\nobtained results are reported in Fig. 2 for the B-implanted\ndose of 2\u00011013 cm\u22122 as a function of annealing temperature\nfor a 60 s treatment. The data refer to the SOI samples\npreamorphized with Ge implantation at different energies, in\norder to locate the EOR defects at different depths inside the\nSOI layer. In all samples a minimum in the free-B amount at\naround 800\u2212850 \u00b0C is evident; at these temperatures more\nthan 80% of the implanted B is trapped at the surface. The\ntendency of B to segregate on the surface traps is higher at\nlow temperature and decreases with increasing temperature.\nHowever, at low temperatures the phenomenon is limited by\nthe low diffusivity which does not allow the B atoms to\nreach the traps at the surface. This is confirmed by the de-\npendence of the trapped B amount from the position of the\nEOR defects. Higher trapping is obtained in the samples\nwhere the dissolving EOR defects, which release interstitials\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Comparison between simulated \u0001dashed lines\u0002 and\nSIMS profiles \u0001continuous lines\u0002 of PAI samples at 20 keV, B implanted\nwith dose 2\u00011013 cm\u22122 after isochronal annealing of 60 s at various tem-\nperatures in SOI \u0001a\u0002, and in bulk material \u0001b\u0002. The graphs clearly evidence\nthe B diffusion toward the surface and the consequent pileup in the surface\nregion.\n103707-3 Ferri et al. J. Appl.

The in-\nterstitial distribution after 60 s annealing at 800 \u00b0C for two\ndifferent depths of the EOR is reported in Fig. 3. A higher\ninterstitial supersaturation in the surface region where the B\nis located and a stronger interstitial flux toward the surface\nare produced in the sample implanted with Ge at 8 keV.\nThese conditions are responsible for the higher B trapping on\nthe surface traps.\nBy increasing the annealing temperature, the tendency to\ntrap B atoms is reduced. This effect, together with lowering\nof interstitial supersaturation with increasing temperature, al-\nlows for B atoms to avoid the surface traps and to diffuse\ninside the bulk in amounts which increase with increasing\nannealing temperature. However, only for temperatures\nhigher than 1050 \u00b0C do we have a nearly complete release\nof the trapped B \u0001see Fig. 2\u0002.\nThe different evolution of the interstitial supersaturation\nis also responsible for the differences in B trapping between\nthe SOI and bulk Si \u0001shown in Fig. 4\u0002 for B-implanted\nsamples at 2\u00011014 cm\u22122. In fact, in SOI samples the buried\noxide acts as a sink for interstitials, increasing the EOR dis-\nsolution rate and reducing the enhancement of B diffusion.8\nThe effect is more evident for the samples preamorphized at\n20 keV due to the proximity of the EOR defects to the buried\noxide layer. Also, for this dose the surface trapping in the\nsamples preamorphized at 8 keV is higher with respect to the\nsurface trapping exhibited by the samples more deeply\npreamorphized at 20 keV.\nThe trend of the untrapped B vs temperature shown in\nFig. 4 is in excellent agreement with that of the sheet resis-\ntivity reported in Ref. 33. The resistivity is strictly related to\nthe active B concentration. Two effects contribute to the B\ndeactivation: \u0001i\u0002 B trapping in proximity of the surface and\n\u0001ii\u0002 formation of neutral Boron Interstitial Clusters \u0001BICs\u0002\ninside the Si lattice in the regions where a high interstitial\nconcentration meets B atoms34; both these contributions in-\ncrease with increasing interstitial supersaturation. However,\nthe strong correlation between resistivity and surface trap-\nping indicates that this last effect is dominant, under these\nexperimental conditions, in determining the resistivity of the\nimplanted layer.\nJunction depths \u0001Xj\u0002 evaluated from SIMS profiles at a\nconcentration of 5\u00011017 cm\u22123 for B-implanted samples at\n2\u00011013 cm\u22122 are reported in Fig. 5 as a function of anneal-\ning temperature.

This means that\nunder these conditions the diffusion toward the traps prevails\non the in-diffusion. For temperatures higher than 900 \u00b0C a\nshallower Xj in SOI material with respect to bulk Si is ob-\ntained, in agreement with previous observations.26 This ef-\nfect was attributed to the interstitial recombination on the\nburied oxide layer.25,26 In order to point out the role of sur-\nface trapping on junction depth, a simulation performed\nwithout taking into account this effect \u0001dashed line\u0002 is also\nreported in Fig. 5. The highest difference between the simu-\nlation and the experimental data occurs at temperatures\naround 800 \u00b0C, where the highest TED effect \u0001for an iso-\nchronal process35\u0002 and surface trapping occur. It is interest-\ning to notice the apparent paradox due to surface trapping,\ni.e., under particular conditions of implantation and anneal-\ning, the higher the diffusivity, the shallower the Xj value, and\nthe higher the sheet resistivity. Similar behavior is also ob-\ntained for Xj of the samples B-implanted at 2\u00011014 cm\u22122\n\u0001not reported\u0002.\nThe samples implanted at 2\u00011015 cm\u22122 are character-\nized by a very high \u0001around 4\u00011021 cm\u22123\u0002 B concentration\nat the surface. Figure 6 shows the comparison between SIMS\nand simulated profiles for SOI samples 60 s annealed at dif-\nferent temperatures. For this high dose, SIMS profiles also\nshow a B accumulation at the surface; however, in this case\nthe traps rapidly saturate by the large quantity of available\ndopant, and the amount of B which diffuses into the Si is\ncontrolled by the precipitates and clusters present in the\nheavily doped surface region, rather than by the trapping\nphenomenon at the surface. In fact, no significant difference\nwas evidenced in the region deeper than 5 nm \u0001and conse-\nquently, in Xj\u0002 between the simulations performed with or\nwithout traps. However, in order to obtain accurate fits in the\nsimulations it is necessary to force the active boron concen-\ntration, which is able to form the mobile pairs, to reduce in a\nfew seconds from the initial value \u0001\u00072\u00011020 cm\u22123, imme-\ndiately after the SPER\u0002 to the solid solubility value at the\nannealing temperature. In this way the entire surface region\n\u0001about 7 nm\u0002, rich with B precipitates and clusters, behaves\nas a sink for the mobile dopant and a B flux toward the\nsurface is still obtained. This also explains the retrograde\nbehavior of Xj observed for this high dose at temperatures\nlower than 850 \u00b0C by the PAI samples at 8 keV both in SOI\nand in bulk Si \u0001see Fig. 7\u0002.\nThe time evolution of the dopant distribution during an-\nnealing is clearly evidenced by the results reported in Fig. 8,\nwhich shows SIMS profiles of samples B-implanted at 2\n\u00011015 cm\u22122 and annealed at 775 \u00b0C for different times. A\nshoulder at about 2\u00011020 cm\u22123 appears after the first an-\nnealing step \u000110 s\u0002. This phenomenon, not observed in the\nsamples Ge-implanted at 8 keV, is attributed to the B diffu-\nsion in the amorphous silicon before the recrystallization.4\nThe boron profile at high concentrations \u0001\u00042\u00011020 cm\u22123\u0002\nlocated in the first 7 nm is immobile upon annealing \u0001due to\nthe formation of cluster or precipitates36\u0002. After the SPER\ncompletion, the B in the shoulder begins to diffuse mainly\ntoward the surface. According to above observations \u0001Fig. 6\u0002,\nsimulation indicates that this can be explained assuming a\ngettering action of the surface traps and of the precipitates\nand clusters already present in the high-concentration B pro-\nfile which act as sinks for the B atoms.\nIV.

This redistribution can be accounted for by simula-\ntions based on pair diffusion models and with the introduc-\ntion of trapping sites in proximity of the surface, without\nconsidering any asymmetric behavior of the dopant move-\nment. The amount of trapped B increases with decreasing\ntemperature, and, for a fixed temperature, is higher under\nconditions of higher diffusivity. The correlation between\ntrapped B and diffusivity explains the increase of the trapped\nB with reduced depth of the amorphous layer and the differ-\nences observed between SOI layers and bulk Si.\nThe sink region is a few monolayers \u00011\u20132 nm\u0002 thick for\ndoses of 2\u00011013 and 2\u00011014 cm\u22122, probably due to trap-\nping in energetically favorable places in proximity of the\nsurface, and extends to about 7 nm for the highest dose of\n2\u00011015 cm\u22123, corresponding to the region of very high B\nconcentration where precipitates and clusters shrink the in-\ncoming B atoms. For the two lowest doses, at temperatures\naround 800 \u00b0C, more than 80% of the implanted dopant is\nmade immobile and electrically inactive. For the highest\ndose of 2\u00011015 cm\u22123 the traps are rapidly saturated by the\nlarge quantity of available dopant, and the amount of B\nwhich diffuses into the Si is controlled by the precipitates\nand clusters present in the heavily doped surface region. No\nsignificant difference was observed in the region deeper than\n5 nm, and consequently in the junction depth, between the\nsimulations performed with or without traps.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was partially supported by the Fondi Integrat-\nivi Ricerca di Base \u0001FIRB\u0002 national project \u0001Contract No.\nRBNE012N3X\u0002.\n1P.
