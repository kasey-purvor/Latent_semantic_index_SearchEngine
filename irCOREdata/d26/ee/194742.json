Milan (Steve.Milan@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe ability to monitor the location of the polar cap bound-\nary, the boundary between \u201cclosed terrestrial\u201d magnetic flux\nand \u201copen\u201d flux interconnected with the solar wind, allows\nfor the electrodynamics of solar-terrestrial coupling to be in-\nvestigated, specifically the storage and release of magnetic\nenergy within the magnetosphere during the substorm cy-\ncle. We show the magnetosphere schematically in Fig. 1. In\nthis diagram we make a distinction between interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) lines (dotted curves), closed terrestrial\nfield lines (solid and dot-dashed curves), i.e. field lines con-\nnected to the Earth at both ends, and open field lines (dashed\ncurves) which interconnect the Earth and the IMF. When the\nIMF has a southward component, reconnection takes place\nbetween the IMF and closed terrestrial field lines on the day-\nside magnetopause at point a (we will refer to this as \u201clow-\nlatitude reconnection\u201d). This causes closed flux to become\nopen, leading to an accumulation of open flux in the magne-\ntosphere, also resulting in an increase in the area of the polar\ncap, that region of the polar ionosphere that is threaded by\nopen flux. An increase in polar cap size, produced by on-\ngoing low-latitude reconnection, is known as the substorm\ngrowth phase. As one end of open magnetic field lines are\nconnected to the antisunward-flowing solar wind, they be-\ncome swept into the magnetotail (b\u2212d) where they represent\nstored magnetic energy. The closure of open magnetic flux\nthrough reconnection in the magnetotail (at point e) causes\na decrease in the polar cap area, and occurs during the sub-\nstorm expansion and recovery phases, representing a release\nof the stored magnetotail energy. Newly-closed field lines\nreturn to the dayside magnetosphere (f \u2212 g) where they can\nparticipate in reconnection at point a again. Down-tail of\nthe nightside reconnection site (point e) field lines are once\nagain unconnected with the Earth and return to the IMF. The\ncycle of magnetic field lines from closed to open to closed\nagain, which results from day- and nightside reconnection,\nis known as magnetospheric convection or the Dungey cy-\n1122 S. E.

Full and dashed curves\nshow closed and open field lines, respectively. The dot-dashed lines\nindicate the open\/closed field line boundary, the ionospheric projec-\ntion of which is the polar cap boundary. Letters a to g indicate the\nevolution of field lines during the Dungey cycle.\ncle. In Fig. 1, dot-dashed lines indicate the \u201clast closed field\nlines\u201d or the boundary between open and closed flux (the\nopen\/closed field line boundary or OCB), which maps to the\npolar cap boundary in the ionosphere. It is clear from this\nthat for southward IMF, the reconnection sites a and e map\nto the polar cap boundary.\nThe reconnection processes at a and e are time-dependent\nphenomena, controlled by the IMF orientation upstream of\nthe Earth on the dayside and by conditions in the magnetotail\non the nightside. A knowledge, then, of variations in polar\ncap area permits quantification of these reconnection rates,\nthat take place in regions which are difficult \u2013 if not impos-\nsible \u2013 to monitor in situ routinely. Reconnection also has\nramifications for the ionosphere. The magnetospheric con-\nvection cycle leads to ionospheric plasma drift in the familiar\ntwin-cell convection pattern, with antisunward flow across\nthe polar cap (open field lines) and return flow at lower lati-\ntudes (closed field lines). This ionospheric convection, when\ncombined with a knowledge of the location of the polar cap\nboundary, can also be used to quantify the rate of reconnec-\ntion.\nIn contrast to southward IMF conditions, when the IMF\nhas a northward component \u201chigh-latitude reconnection\u201d can\ntake place with pre-existing open field lines in the magne-\ntospheric lobes (this might occur near b). Depending on\nwhether individual solar wind magnetic field lines reconnect\nwith both northern and southern lobes or reconnect with only\none, it is thought that open magnetic flux can be closed or the\namount of open flux in the system can remain unchanged, re-\nspectively (see Cowley, 1981, and references therein). In ei-\nther case, a region of sunward ionospheric flow is predicted\nwithin the polar cap, and the dayside reconnection site no\nlonger necessarily maps to the polar cap boundary. Again,\nmeasurements of changes in polar cap area should help un-\nderstand this phenomenon. For these reasons, this paper\ncharts changes in polar cap area during two substorm cycles,\nto help elucidate the role of reconnection in the solar wind-\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system.\nThe relationship between the amount of open flux in the\nsystem and the reconnection rate can be summarized by\nthe following statement of Faraday\u2019s Law (e.g. Siscoe and\nHuang, 1985; Lockwood and Cowley, 1992; Lewis et al.,\n1998):\nBI\ndApc\ndt\n= 8day \u22128night . (1)\nHere, BI is the magnetic field strength in the ionosphere,\nassumed to be constant over the polar region and approxi-\nmately equal to 5 \u00d7 104 nT, and Apc is the area of the polar\ncap, that is the region penetrated by open field lines. Hence,\nBIApc is the amount of open flux, Fpc, associated with each\nhemisphere, necessarily equal in both. The RHS of Eq. (1) is\nthe emf induced around the polar cap boundary (or, equally,\nthe magnetic separatrix in the magnetosphere), which here\nwe have resolved into two components, the day- and night-\nside reconnection voltages 8day and 8night. The reconnec-\ntion voltages are the integrals of the day- and nightside recon-\nnection electric fields along those portions of the polar cap\nboundary, or open\/closed field line boundary (OCB), which\nmap to the reconnection sites or \u201cmerging gaps\u201d. These re-\nconnection electric fields, Er , are associated with E \u00d7 B\nplasma drift in the ionosphere, perpendicular to the bound-\nary, and so the change in area of the polar cap should also\nbe related to the convection flow across the boundary in unit\ntime. The reconnection electric field is measured in the frame\nof reference of the boundary, and so motions of the bound-\nary itself, for instance, moving equatorward as the polar cap\nexpands during substorm growth phase, must be taken into\naccount.\nLockwood et al. (1990), Cowley and Lockwood (1992),\nCowley et al. (1992) and Lockwood and Cowley (1992) give\na framework within which changes in the amount of open\nflux in the polar cap can be understood. Initially, it is as-\nsumed that the open and closed flux of the magnetosphere\nare in a state of equilibrium and that the polar cap is cir-\ncular, containing flux Fpc. In response to a pulse of day-\nside reconnection, a region of closed flux 1Fpc adjacent to\nthe pre-existing dayside polar cap boundary is opened in the\ntime interval 1t . By definition, the OCB \u2013 the boundary\nwhich encloses open flux \u2013 has then moved equatorwards to\nencompass this new open flux. If the merging gap is of length\nl and reconnection is uniform along it, then the OCB moves\nequatorwards by a distance 1F\/BIl everywhere along that\nlength, to enclose the new flux, and the velocity of the bound-\nary motion is 1F\/BIl1t . Although in the present exam-\nple the plasma flow in the frame of reference of the Earth is\nzero, in the frame of the boundary there is an E \u00d7 B drift\nof magnitude v\u2032 = Er\/BI, driven by the reconnection elec-\ntric field Er , and hence, Er = 1F\/l1t . The reconnection\nvoltage, the integral of Er along the merging gap, is seen\nto be 8day = 1F\/1t , equivalent to Eq. (1). The OCB is\nnow distended on the dayside, having departed from its equi-\nlibrium shape. Plasma flows are excited in the Earth\u2019s ref-\nerence frame to return the system to equilibrium (a circular\npolar cap) once again, that is a poleward motion in the region\nof new open flux and an equatorward motion at other local\nS. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1123\ntimes around the OCB. At this stage there is no plasma flow\nacross the OCB, that is the OCB moves with the plasma flow\n\u2013 it is said to be \u201cadiaroic\u201d, meaning \u201cno flow across\u201d (Sis-\ncoe and Huang, 1985) \u2013 and the electric field in the frame\nof the boundary is zero. To achieve this redistribution of the\nflux and to return the OCB to its circular equilibrium state,\nthese plasma flows will have the familiar twin-cell pattern\nof the convection flow (e.g. Heppner and Maynard, 1987;\nRuohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996). The new location of the\nOCB, encompassing more flux Fpc+1Fpc as it does, will be\nat a lower latitude than before the reconnection burst, as ex-\npected during the substorm growth phase. Conversely, during\nthe substorm expansion phase, when reconnection occurs in\nthe magnetotail closing pre-existing open flux, the boundary\nmoves polewards as the polar cap shrinks.\nFor the benefit of the discussion above we have artificially\nseparated in time the boundary motion associated with re-\nconnection and the plasma drift associated with the redistri-\nbution of the system back to equilibrium. In general, these\ncan and do occur in tandem, though the plasma drift usu-\nally lags behind the boundary motion due to induction ef-\nfects which introduce a finite timescale (\u223c10 min) into the\nexcitation of ionospheric convection (Lockwood and Davis,\n1996). When variations in the reconnection rate occur more\nrapidly than the convection can respond, then the indepen-\ndent nature of the two processes is made manifest: during\nintervals of quasi-periodic bursty reconnection at the mag-\nnetopause, the OCB can move in a saw-tooth motion, pro-\ngressing equatorwards during bursts of reconnection and re-\nlaxing polewards when no reconnection is ongoing, though\nwith an overall trend to lower latitudes (Milan et al., 1999;\nMilan and Lester, 2001). In this situation, when interested\nonly in longer term changes in the polar cap area, it is possi-\nble to average the motion of the OCB over these short period\n(10 min) perturbations and consider only the overall trend.\nIn addition, reconnection can occur in the magnetotail and\non the dayside simultaneously. In this situation the day- and\nnightside reconnection rates are in competition, that is creat-\ning and destroying open flux, respectively. In the case where\n8day and 8night are equal, the polar cap neither expands nor\ncontracts with time, though convective flows transport open\nflux across the polar cap from its creation on the dayside to\nits destruction on the nightside, with return flow of closed\nflux at lower latitudes. When 8day and 8night are not equal,\nthe change in polar cap area reflects the imbalance in the two\nprocesses.\nClearly, a determination of the polar cap area is desir-\nable. Unfortunately, however, it can be difficult to locate the\nionospheric projection of the open\/closed field line bound-\nary, either from ground-based observations or in situ mea-\nsurements made by low-Earth orbiting satellites. Although\nthere are a number of signatures which can be employed as\nproxies for the OCB, some of these still require verification\n(Rodger, 2000). On the dayside, one of the more accepted\nof these proxies is the poleward edge of high energy (1\u2013\n10 s keV) electron precipitation, that is precipitation of par-\nticles trapped on closed field lines (field lines g in Fig. 1).\nThis cutoff in high energy electrons was originally identified\nin electrons with energies of 10 s\u2013100 s keV (e.g. Evans and\nStone, 1972), for which the terms electron \u201ctrapping limit\u201d\nor \u201ctrapping boundary\u201d were coined, but it is as equally\npresent in electrons of a few keV as well. Poleward of the\ntrapping boundary observed particle energies are characteris-\ntic of magnetosheath plasma (< 1 keV electrons) indicating\nrecently-reconnected dayside field lines that are directly open\nto the magnetosheath and solar wind (field lines just pole-\nward of a), or polar rain (\u223c100 eV electrons) on field lines\nwhich map into the magnetotail lobes (b \u2212 d), again open\n(though less directly) to the solar wind. Certainly, field lines\npoleward of the dayside trapping boundary must be open,\nthough whether field lines that are some fraction of a degree\nequatorward of this boundary may sometimes also be open\nis still an open question (Lockwood, 1997; Oksavik et al.,\n2000). In the current paper we use this boundary between\nhigh and low energy electron precipitation as our main proxy\nof the OCB on the dayside, keeping in mind the possibility\nthat we may underestimate the total open flux by a small de-\ngree.\nTo complicate matters, the trapping boundary cannot be\nused to identify the OCB on the nightside, as here it marks\nthe transition from dipolar to more stretched field lines (say,\nnear point f in Fig. 1), and in the ionosphere it would mark\nthe boundary between diffuse and more discrete aurora at\nhigher latitudes. However, the edge between polar rain and\nharder precipitation associated with the discrete aurora can\nagain be used, though now these high energy particles are\nnot necessarily trapped but can be accelerated by the recon-\nnection process ongoing at point e. These energized particles\nare again observed equatorward of the OCB in the closed\nfield line region because field lines convect from the open to\nclosed region through the action of reconnection.\nThus, on both the dayside and the nightside, the bound-\nary between energetic particles at lower latitudes and softer\nprecipitation at higher latitudes can be identified with the\nOCB. This boundary is easily identified in low-Earth orbit\nparticle measurements, though this only provides two \u201cpoint\nmeasurements\u201d of the boundary location along each satellite\npass of the polar region. Thus, it is advantageous to find other\nmeasurement techniques that allow for the boundary to be lo-\ncated over extended spatial regions and\/or at higher temporal\nresolutions than afforded by orbiting spacecraft.\nOne method senses the influence on the ionospheric elec-\ntron density of the energetic precipitation on closed field\nlines: significant impact ionization of the lower ionosphere\n(< 150 km) is expected, and the poleward edge of the\nresulting density enhancement can be employed to map\nthe boundary (de la Beaujardiere et al., 1991; Blanchard\net al., 2001). To make such measurements, however, a\nmeridionally-scanning incoherent scatter radar is necessary,\nand these are even less plentiful than spacecraft. The pre-\ncipitating high energy particles also give rise to auroral lu-\nminosity, which can be detected with ground- or space-based\noptical imagers. Harder (\u223c10 keV) and softer (\u223c1 keV) elec-\ntrons produce green- and red-line emission in the E- and F-\n1124 S. E.

On the nightside, where the boundary\nbetween polar rain (\u223c100 eV) on open field lines and precip-\nitation on closed field lines (1 keV and above) is especially\nclear, the poleward edges of both emissions should delineate\nthe OCB, though Blanchard et al. (1995) identified red-line\nemission as the best indicator of the OCB location. On the\ndayside, where most soft precipitation is of magnetosheath\norigin and occurs on newly-reconnected open field lines, the\nOCB boundary is identified as the poleward edge of luminos-\nity dominated by green-line emissions and the equatorward\nedge of red-line dominated luminosity (e.g. Lockwood et al.,\n1993). A very clear example of the coincidence of the trap-\nping boundary with the boundary between red- and green-\nline dominated aurora is presented by Lorentzen et al. (1996).\nGround-based optical observations have the advantage over\nincoherent scatter measurements that imagers are more nu-\nmerous and have a larger viewing area, though operations\nnear local noon are restricted to a short observational win-\ndow around winter solstice. Space-based imagers have, in\nprinciple, global coverage, and so they are ideal for finding\nthe OCB over a wide range of MLTs (e.g. Frank and Craven,\n1988). In addition, UV imagers, for example the UVI instru-\nment on board the Polar spacecraft (Torr et al., 1995), are\nable to make observations of the sunlit summer hemisphere,\nS. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1125\nthough dayglow can swamp the auroral emission near noon.\nHF radars, such as those which comprise the Super Dual\nAuroral Radar Network or SuperDARN (Greenwald et al.,\n1995), measure the line-of-sight Doppler shift imposed on\nBragg scatter echoes from ionospheric irregularities as a\ntracer of convection flow. In addition, Doppler spread and\nbackscatter power (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) information\nare gained, which permit some identification of the magneto-\nspheric regions to which the observations map. For instance,\na boundary between low spectral width echoes at lower lat-\nitudes and high spectral width echoes poleward of this has\nbeen identified with the OCB, on both the dayside (Baker\net al., 1995) and the nightside (Lester et al., 2001). On the\ndayside, this boundary can be accompanied by a significant\nstep in backscatter power, with backscatter from the closed\nfield line region having an SNR below the sensitivity of the\nradar system (Milan and Lester, 2001). In this situation only\nhigh spectral width echoes are observed, and it is the equa-\ntorward edge of the backscatter region itself which represents\nthe spectral width boundary; this has been found to match\nvery well the equatorward edge of dayside red-line aurora\nand hence, the OCB (Rodger et al., 1995; Yeoman et al.,\n1997; Milan et al., 1998, 1999), though this relationship has\nbeen found to break down for northward IMF (Moen et al.,\n2001).\nIn practice, it is difficult to determine the latitude of the\nOCB continuously at all local times. Those studies that have\nattempted this in the past have suffered from distinct draw-\nbacks, or have employed proxies for the OCB which we feel\nare suspect. Taylor et al. (1996) employed the convection re-\nversal boundary given by the Assimilative Mapping of Iono-\nspheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure as an indicator\nof the location of the OCB, though this boundary is not nec-\nessarily a reliable OCB proxy. Sotirelis et al. (1998) em-\nployed overpasses of the polar region by four spacecraft to\ndetermine estimates of the OCB location at up to eight posi-\ntions, but observations had to be collated for up to one hour\nto achieve this. Akasofu et al. (1992) also used particle ob-\nservations, though with fewer spacecraft; furthermore, they\nerroneously identified the OCB with the poleward edge of\n\u223c300 eV electrons, which we would rather ascribe to mag-\nnetosheath precipitation, thus making their assessment of the\npolar cap area a considerable underestimation. Instead, most\nstudies monitor a limited portion of the boundary and gen-\neralize its location and motion to all local times. This was\nthe method employed by Lewis et al. (1998), who deter-\nmined the motion of the OCB on the nightside, and Milan\nand Lester (2001), who identified the OCB on the dayside,\nboth in HF radar observations. Provan et al. (2002), again us-\ning HF radars, extended this technique by observing both the\nnoon and midnight auroral oval simultaneously. At present,\nhowever, it is not clear how well this generalization holds.\nThis study attempts to investigate this question by locating\nthe OCB over as broad a local time extent as possible, em-\nploying a combination of low altitude particle measurements,\nUV auroral images, and HF radar backscatter.\nFinally, as suggested above, measurement of the convec-\ntion flow across the OCB allows for the day- or nightside\nreconnection voltages to be measured directly, and previ-\nous workers have attempted this. For instance, de la Beau-\njardiere et al. (1991) and Blanchard et al. (1995) both mea-\nsured substorm-associated convection flow across the night-\nside OCB with the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar, em-\nploying the E-region and red-line edges as proxies for the\nOCB, respectively. On the dayside, Baker et al. (1997) and\nPinnock and Rodger (2001) used SuperDARN observations\nto estimate the dayside reconnection voltage, employing the\nspectral width boundary as an estimate of the location of\nthe OCB. The former of these studies, Baker et al. (1997),\nsuffered from the drawback that observations from only one\nradar were available, and it was found that the merging gap\nwas probably more extensive than the radar field-of-view.\nPinnock and Rodger (2001) had four radars at their disposal,\nand consequently, a greater proportion of the merging gap\nwas imaged. The present study attempts a similar analysis,\nthough using six radars covering almost the entirety of the\ndayside auroral zone, to quantify the reconnection rate. This\nallows for a comparison with our estimate of the simultane-\nous rate of change of the polar cap area.\n2 Observations and discussion\nThe interval of study is 09:00 to 16:30 UT on 5 June 1998.\nDuring this interval, the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) instrument\non board the Polar satellite (Torr et al., 1995) was imaging al-\nmost the entirety of the Northern Hemisphere auroral zone,\ngiving continuous information regarding the size of the po-\nlar cap. In addition, six Super Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN) radars (Greenwald et al., 1995) were provid-\ning convection flow measurements in the dayside ionosphere,\nthat region in which dayglow makes measurement of the au-\nrora difficult for the UVI imager. The combination of these\ntwo data sets allows for the OCB to be monitored at nearly\nall local times. Finally, overpasses of the Defense Mete-\norological Satellite Program DMSP F13 and F14 satellites\n(Hardy et al., 1984), the National Oceanographic and At-\nmospheric Administration NOAA-12 satellite (Raben et al.,\n1995), and the Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) spacecraft\n(Carlson et al., 1998) provide auroral particle measurements\nwhich allow the OCB to be identified without ambiguity, and\nin effect calibrate the UVI and SuperDARN measurements.\nTwo substorms occurred during the interval of interest, the\nprogress of which were monitored by six magnetometer sta-\ntions from the 210 Magnetic Meridian (210MM) network\n(Yumoto, 1996) and the Canadian Auroral Network for the\nOPEN Program Unified Study (CANOPUS) network (as de-\nscribed by Samson et al., 1992). These stations are KTN,\nTIK, and CHD (210MM) and DAWS, FSIM, and RABB\n(CANOPUS). Upstream solar wind and IMF conditions were\nmonitored by the Wind and ACE spacecraft.\n1126 S. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles\nFig. 3. H -component magnetograms from the 210MM and CANO-\nPUS networks, along with filtered data showing Pi2 activity (scaled\nby a factor of 5 for clarity). Vertical dot-dashed lines are the same\nas Fig. 2.\n2.1 Overview\nPolar UVI images were acquired with the LBH-long filter\nevery 37 s. These observations are summarized in Fig. 2a\u2013c,\nwhich show latitude-time-intensity plots of the auroral lumi-\nnosity measured along the 18, 00, and 06 MLT meridians.\nAt the start of the interval, before approximately 12:00 UT,\na band of luminosity is seen to progress gradually equator-\nwards, especially along the 06 and 18 MLT meridians. Dur-\ning this period, two minor auroral brightenings are observed\nalong the 00 MLT meridian, the most significant of which\nstarted at 10:20 UT, which we will refer to as \u201cauroral bright-\nening 1\u201d (AB1). At 11:20 UT another intensification of the\nauroral luminosity at 00 MLT signifies substorm expansion\nphase onset, \u201csubstorm breakup 1\u201d (SB1). This luminosity\nbroadens considerably at 11:40 UT and a poleward motion of\nthe lower latitude boundary of the luminosity becomes appar-\nent. The auroral substorm bulge is seen to progress to earlier\nand later local times, crossing the 06 and 18 MLT meridi-\nans at 11:55 and 12:05 UT, respectively. Following this there\nis a poleward retreat of the auroral luminosity, which also\ndims with time, until 14:00 UT when it has almost disap-\npeared entirely, except along the midnight meridian. After\nthis time, however, it is clear that the auroral band is mov-\ning equatorwards once again. Finally, at 15:20 UT the aurora\nintensifies once again, again signifying substorm onset. Ex-\namination of auroral images at all local times indicates that\nthe auroral brightening (\u201cauroral brightening 2\u201d, AB2) actu-\nally commences in the post-midnight sector, some time close\nto 14:55 UT, followed by a major intensification in the pre-\nmidnight sector at 15:20 UT, \u201csubstorm breakup 2\u201d (SB2).\nFigure 3 shows H -component magnetograms from three\n210MM stations located in the pre-midnight sector and three\nCANOPUS stations located in the post-midnight sector. The\nlocations of these stations are shown in Fig. 4 as red dots, cor-\nresponding, from west to east, to TIK, KTN, CHD, DAWS,\nFSIM, and RABB. At the start of our interval the CANO-\nPUS stations are located closest to midnight, and hence, it\nis these stations which observe the first substorm (SB1) bay\nand associated Pi2 signature most clearly (11:20 UT). Prior\nto this, at 10:20 UT, there is also evidence of a small bay and\nsome Pi2 activity associated with the first auroral brighten-\ning (AB1). As time passes and the stations progress to later\nlocal times, the 210MM stations approach midnight and it is\nhere that the second substorm (SB2) bay and Pi2 are most\nclearly observed (15:20 UT). It is interesting to note that the\nauroral brightening (AB2) prior to this at 14:55 UT does not\nhave a clear signature in the magnetograms (except maybe\nat DAWS), but this is perhaps because the auroral activity\ntakes place in the gap between the two magnetometer net-\nworks. The times of these auroral features, AB1, SB1, AB2,\nand SB2, are indicated by vertical dot-dashed lines in both\nFigs. 2 and 3.\nLatitude-time plots of Doppler velocity measured by the\nKapuskasing and Goose Bay radars, beams 12 and 6, re-\nspectively, are shown in Fig. 2d and e. Between 09:00 and\n16:30 UT these two radars progress from the dawn sector to\nthe noon sector. Radar echoes are not observed at all times or\nlatitudes, but are dependent on the presence of irregularities\nin the ionosphere from which to backscatter (for a discus-\nsion, see Milan et al., 1997). Indeed, the occurrence of iono-\nspheric irregularities, and hence, radar backscatter, often ap-\nS. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1127\n(a\u2013b)\nFig. 4.

(Lower panels)\nElectron and ion measurements from the overpassing satellite. In the case of DMSP F13 and F14 and FAST, these are spectrograms between\n\u223c10 eV and 30 keV. In the case of NOAA-12 these are fluxes of > 30 keV electrons and ions at two pitch angles \u2013 10\u25e6 (i.e. precipitating; red\nlines) and 80\u25e6 (i.e. trapped; blue lines) \u2013 and \u223c100 eV particles mainly of magnetosheath origin (green lines). These latter fluxes have been\nreduced by a factor of 103 for plotting purposes. From these observations, six boundaries have been identified, 1 and 6 being the approximate\nequatorward boundary of precipitating trapped particles, 2 and 5 the poleward edge of this region, i.e. the trapping boundary, our proxy for\nthe OCB, and 3 and 4 the approximate poleward edge of the magnetosheath precipitation.\npears to delineate important magnetospheric boundaries (Mi-\nlan et al., 1998), and in the present study it is the equatorward\nedge of the main region of backscatter, corresponding to the\nspectral width boundary, as discussed in the Introduction, on\nwhich we will concentrate below. For the time being we note\nthat the Goose Bay radar observes scatter throughout most\nof the interval, and the latitudinal variation in the location\nof this scatter qualitatively follows the auroral observations\ndescribed above, i.e. there is little motion of the backscat-\nter prior to 11:30 UT, followed by a poleward progression\nuntil 13:30 UT. After this time the scatter moves equator-\nward once again, until a poleward retreat some time after\n16:00 UT. The Kapuskasing radar observes backscatter only\nafter 13:30 UT, but here again this is dominated by an equa-\ntorward motion until 16:20 UT, after which the backscatter\nretreats polewards.\nFigure 2f and g indicate the By and Bz components of the\nIMF as measured by both the ACE (thin line) and Wind (thick\nline) spacecraft, lagged to the magnetopause by the estimated\nsolar wind propagation delay (66 and 78 min, respectively).\nFigure 2h shows the corresponding IMF clock angle, defined\nas \u03b8 = atan (Bz, By). In general, an extremely good agree-\nment is found between both solar wind monitors, giving con-\nfidence that we are able to characterize the incoming IMF\norientation with accuracy. For the purposes of the present\nstudy we can say that IMF By was approximately \u22125 nT for\nthe duration of the interval of interest. The Bx component\n(not shown) varied slowly between 0 and 3 nT throughout\nmost of the interval. The Bz component of the IMF, the\nmost important for determining the level of coupling between\n1128 S. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles\n(c\u2013d)\nFig. 4. Continued ...\nthe solar wind and magnetosphere on the dayside, varies be-\ntween positive and negative throughout the interval, but does\nso in a series of sharp transitions, especially after 11:00 UT.\nFour sub-intervals can be identified in which Bz is predom-\ninantly negative: 09:00\u201310:00 UT, 10:20\u201311:15 UT, 12:15\u2013\n12:30 UT, and 13:50\u201315:30 UT. By way of a first compari-\nson between these IMF observations and the auroral observa-\ntions, we note that the last of these sub-intervals in which Bz\nis negative, suggesting that dayside low-latitude reconnec-\ntion should be ongoing, is associated with an equatorward\nmotion of the aurora observed by UVI and backscatter ob-\nserved by SuperDARN. Conversely, backscatter and aurora\nare observed to retreat polewards when Bz is positive and\nsubstorm activity is pronounced (11:30\u201313:00 UT and after\n16:00 UT).\n2.2 Identification of the polar cap boundary\nWe have seen that features in auroral and radar observa-\ntions appear to move equatorward or poleward in response\nto changes in the IMF or the occurrence of substorms. In\nthe next section, we employ satellite particle observations to\ndetermine which auroral and radar features give a good indi-\ncation of the location of the OCB, to allow us to estimate the\narea of the polar cap. The FAST, DMSP and NOAA satel-\nlites overpass the northern polar regions thirteen times dur-\ning this interval, marked at the top of Fig. 2. We cannot show\nthe details of all of these overpasses, and so we concentrate\non the six most representative. Figure 4 presents compos-\nite diagrams of the UVI, SuperDARN, and FAST, DMSP or\nNOAA data sets for each of these six overpasses. The up-\nper panels show a UVI image in magnetic latitude and MLT\ncoordinates from a time close to the middle of the overpass\nand the backscatter observed simultaneously by the (in or-\nder from west to east) Kapuskasing, Goose Bay, and Han-\nkasalmi radars of the SuperDARN chain. The fields-of-view\nof these radars are indicated by dashed lines. Three other\nNorthern Hemisphere radars are also making measurements\nat these times, Saskatoon, Stokkseyri, and Pykkvib\u00e6r, but\nfor clarity these data are not shown, as their fields-of-view\noverlap with those already presented. Backscatter is only\nshown where significant return power is observed, and this\nbackscatter is colour-coded with the spectral width of the re-\nturn echoes. The UVI images have been processed to remove\nthe dayglow. Unfortunately, dayglow swamps weak auroral\nemissions from the dayside and little luminosity is observed\nnear noon, especially towards the end of our interval when\nthe geomagnetic pole is rotated towards the Sun.\nThe lower panels show the electron and ion characteristics\nobserved by the overpassing satellite. Both DMSP and FAST\nobservations are presented as spectrograms: in the case of\nDMSP F13 and F14, these cover the energy range 30 eV to\nS. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1129\n(e\u2013f)\nFig. 4. Continued ...\n30 keV, in 18 energy channels; the FAST spectrograms show\nparticle fluxes between energies of 5 eV and 30 keV, in 47\nenergy channels. In the case of NOAA-12 these are fluxes\nof \u201ctrapped\u201d > 30 keV electrons and ions at two pitch an-\ngles \u2013 10\u25e6 (i.e. precipitating; red lines) and 80\u25e6 (i.e. mir-\nroring just below the spacecraft; blue lines) \u2013 and \u223c100 eV\nparticles (green lines). It is these particle observations that\nwe employ to identify the OCB, which we then generalize\nto all local times using the UVI and SuperDARN observa-\ntions as a guide. In particular, the OCB signature we look\nfor is a sharp demarcation between high and low fluxes of\nhigh energy (> few keV) particles. These high energy par-\nticles are generally considered to be present on closed field\nlines only, as such particles cannot persist for long on open\nfield lines. In each overpass the occurrence of this signature\nas the satellite passes into and then out of the polar cap is\nmarked by the numbers 2 and 5. Four other boundaries are\nalso marked for interest. The first pair represent the approx-\nimate low-latitude boundaries of the high energy particles (1\nand 6). In addition to the high energy particles, low energy\nprecipitation is also observed. Significant fluxes of low en-\nergy (< 1 keV) electrons can be observed poleward of the\nOCB, and on the dayside this precipitation is considered to\nbe of magnetosheath origin. In such regions, dispersed ion\nsignatures (few eV\u201310 keV) can also be found, a character-\nistic of very recently reconnected field lines, as will be dis-\ncussed in more detail below. The approximate high latitude\nextremes of this precipitation region are indicated by bound-\naries 3 and 4. Poleward of this, a low flux of very low en-\nergy (\u223c100 eV) electrons is indicative of polar rain on open\nfield lines. The points at which these boundaries are crossed\nalong the satellite track are indicated in the top panels by tick\nmarks. As will be described below, in each overpass we find\ngratifying consistency between the observations of all three\ntechniques.\nWe turn first to the DMSP F14 overpass of 11:10 UT\n(Fig. 4a). As the satellite crosses the dusk auroral oval, the\nregion of high energy precipitation on closed field lines is\nfound to coincide with the peak in UV luminosity (1 \u2212 2).\nLower luminosity emission is seen just poleward of this, and\nthis is associated with low energy electron precipitation on\nrecently opened field lines (2\u22123). As the satellite approaches\nthe noon sector OCB a dispersed ion feature is observed, in\nwhich ion energy decreases with increasing latitude (4 \u2212 5).\nSuch features are characteristic of precipitation on newly-\nreconnected field lines for southward IMF (e.g. Reiff et al.,\n1977; Woch and Lundin, 1992), with the dispersion being a\nconsequence of the velocity filter effect. The sharp lower-\nlatitude cutoff of this ion feature marks the OCB, and though\nhigh energy electrons are observed equatorward of this, they\nare of extremely low flux. No luminosity is observed in con-\njunction with this traversal of the auroral zone, as here the\n1130 S. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles\naurora are swamped by dayglow. Backscatter is observed\nin the pre-noon sector by the Goose Bay radar at this time.\nIn the equatorward portion of this backscatter the spectral\nwidths are high, and it is the equatorward edge of this re-\ngion of backscatter which we associate with the OCB. As\nexpected, this equatorward edge of the backscatter is found\nto line up with the poleward edge of the auroral oval in the\ndawn sector, and a similar association can be seen in both\ndawn and dusk sectors in Fig. 4f, another period of south-\nward IMF. This association between the backscatter and the\nOCB appears to break down at other times, when the IMF is\ndirected northwards, as we will see below.\nUsing the signatures of the OCB which we have identified,\ni.e. the poleward boundary of high energy precipitation, the\npoleward gradient in the UVI auroral intensity, and the equa-\ntorward boundary of high spectral width radar backscatter, it\nis possible to estimate the location of the OCB at most local\ntimes. This is shown along each MLT meridian as a dot. The\ndots are solid if there are observations within that MLT sec-\ntor which identify the OCB latitude. If no nearby signature\nis found, the OCB latitude is interpolated from earlier and\nlater MLTs, and this is shown by open dots. The area of the\npolar cap is then easily calculated by numerically integrating\nthe size of each MLT sector, and this area is shown in the\ntop right of each panel. While we realize that this determi-\nnation of the polar cap area, Apc, is only approximate, we\nfind that the error introduced by assuming that our estimate\nof the boundary latitude is off by +1\u25e6 at all MLTs, or off\nby \u22121\u25e6 at all MLTs, is only of the order of \u00b110%. As will\nbe discussed below, we are primarily interested in relative\nchanges in area, and so as long as our boundaries have been\nestimated consistently, these errors have a negligible impact\non our conclusions.\nFinally, mainly for illustrative purposes, though this will\nbe of use later, an approximate OCB is shown by a dot-\ndashed line in each panel. The fit is achieved by determining\nthe Fourier transform of the OCB latitude as a function of\nMLT and then using the first six terms as a series expansion\nto represent the boundary. This order of fit was found to be\na good compromise between representing our boundary esti-\nmates with accuracy without introducing spurious \u201cwiggles\u201d,\nespecially on the dayside where this fit will be used later on.\nThe above discussion for Fig. 4a, an overpass during\nwhich IMF Bz < 0 nT, is equally valid for the other\nIMF southward pass shown in Fig. 4f. At this time, radar\nbackscatter is observed across almost the entirety of the day-\nside boundary, between 06 and 18 MLT. Later, we will em-\nploy this coverage to estimate the dayside reconnection volt-\nage. However, for now we note that this allows us to esti-\nmate the location of the dayside OCB with accuracy, even\nwhere no auroral luminosity is seen. The relationship dis-\ncussed above between the equatorward boundary of the radar\nscatter and the OCB is confirmed in this overpass as the\nsatellite tracks directly overhead the radar fields-of-view. In-\ndeed, there appears to be a close correspondence between\nradar backscatter and precipitation of magnetosheath origin\non open field lines, that is between boundaries 2 \u2212 3 and\n4 \u2212 5. In addition, a distinct dispersed ion signature is seen\nby DMSP F14 as it traverses the radar backscatter near noon.\nA slightly different story is found during intervals of north-\nward IMF, that is Fig. 4b\u2013e. At these times significant but\nlow level auroral luminosity appears within the polar cap\npoleward of the OCB, co-located with the magnetosheath\nprecipitation on open field lines (boundaries 2\u2212 3 and 4\u2212 5)\non the dayside. We assume that the OCB is co-located with\nthe equatorward edge of this luminosity. In Fig. 4d this lu-\nminosity feature displays a distinct enhancement near local\nnoon, similar to that found by Milan et al. (2000a) and Frey et\nal. (2002), who identified this as a signature of high-latitude\nreconnection. Indeed, the close approach of the FAST space-\ncraft to this auroral region shows a distinct reversed cusp ion\ndispersion at its poleward edge, that is ion energy falling with\ndecreasing latitude, again a signature of high-latitude recon-\nnection (Woch and Lundin, 1992). At these times of north-\nward IMF the radar backscatter no longer appears to define\nthe OCB with any accuracy, especially near noon, as was\nfound by Moen et al. (2001). There is some suggestion, how-\never, that when backscatter is present it lies close to the pole-\nward edge of the high-latitude luminosity region (Figs. 4b, c\nand e).\nOn the nightside, the main auroral oval is most luminous\nin Fig. 4b, as this is the expansion phase of the first sub-\nstorm (SB1), but decreases markedly in brightness through\nto Fig. 4e. It is only after the subsequent southward turn-\ning of the IMF (Fig. 4f) and onset of the second substorm\n(not shown) that the low-latitude, nightside auroral luminos-\nity begins to increase to its original levels. The one satellite\noverpass of the nightside auroral zone that is available to this\nstudy, that of the FAST spacecraft at 12:56 UT (Fig. 4d), in-\ndicates that the poleward edge of the auroral bulge of SB1\n(which should map to reconnection site e in Fig. 1) is co-\nlocated with the loss of high energy electrons and ions; pole-\nward of this the particle characteristics are indicative of open\nfield lines. Weak auroral emission is present poleward of\nthe OCB at this time, though the origin of this is not clear\nsince the weak, soft precipitation observed inside the po-\nlar cap should not generate significant luminosity. More\nnoon-midnight satellite passes would be necessary to fully\ndetermine how the nightside auroral emission relates to the\nlocation of the OCB, especially during periods when the\nnightside reconnection site is not active. In the absence of\nmore concrete evidence, and following the FAST overpass of\nFig. 4d, we have placed the OCB at the maximum in the gra-\ndient of the UVI intensity at the poleward edge of the night-\nside auroral oval. We feel that our uncertainty in the location\nof the nightside OCB contributes most significantly to any er-\nror in our estimation of the polar cap area. To counteract this,\nas discussed above, we have attempted to be as consistent as\npossible in our boundary identification.\nIn summary, Fig. 5 presents a schematic showing the most\nimportant particle, UV aurora and radar backscatter features\nwhich we have identified above, and their relationship to the\nOCB, under southward and northward IMF conditions and\nnon-substorm intervals (no reconnection at point e in Fig. 1).\nS.

A schematic diagram illustrating the main signatures em-\nployed to identify the OCB (thick solid line) and their relationship\nto the dayside merging gap (thick broken line) and convection flow,\nfor IMF northwards and southwards. Panels to the left indicate the\nUV and radar auroral regions. Precipitating particle characteristics\nand convection streamlines are shown to the right.\nTo the left, radar and auroral features are shown, and on the\nright particle signatures are indicated along with our expec-\ntation of the convection flow associated with low- or high-\nlatitude reconnection; for simplicity, we have neglected the\ninfluence of IMF By on the convection streamlines. For both\nnorthward and southward IMF cases, the dayside OCB maps\nto point a in Fig. 1. For southward IMF, reconnection occurs\nat a and the merging gap maps to the OCB. During north-\nward IMF, however, reconnection occurs at high latitudes,\nnear b, and as a consequence the ionospheric projection of\nthe merging gap is located within the polar cap. In both\ncases magnetosheath-like precipitation and dispersed ion sig-\nnatures are observed on field lines that have recently crossed\nthe merging gap; as a consequence of the directions of con-\nvection flow in each case, magnetosheath precipitation coats\nthe poleward edge of the dayside OCB. High energy precip-\nitation on closed field lines appears at all local times, though\nthe UV aurora associated with this tend to be weaker on the\ndayside, especially where dayglow dominates. During north-\nward IMF and after substorm activity has died away the main\nUV oval becomes faint and confined to the nightside.\n2.3 Variations in polar cap area\nThe thirteen satellite overpasses described in the previous\nsection allow for the OCB to be extrapolated to all local\ntimes, based on the supporting radar and auroral observa-\ntions. Between each pass, the same radar and auroral sig-\nnatures can be used to identify the location of the OCB, even\nwhen particle data are not available. In this way, the loca-\ntion of the OCB and the area of the polar cap have been\ndetermined every 10 min throughout the interval 09:00 to\n16:30 UT. Figures 6a\u2013d show time series of the latitude of\nthe OCB as determined along the dawn, dusk, noon and mid-\nnight meridians. Filled circles show where the OCB latitude\nwas determined from a nearby particle, auroral or radar sig-\nnature, whereas open circles show points which were inter-\npolated (as discussed in relation to Fig. 4). Figure 6e shows\nthe polar cap area, Apc, determined from the boundary iden-\ntifications. The grey region shows the uncertainty in the de-\ntermination of Apc, in the limits that the latitude of the OCB\nwas over- or underestimated by 1\u25e6 of latitude at all local\ntimes. As suggested by Eq. (1), the rate of change the of po-\nlar cap area is related to the difference between the day- and\nnightside reconnection rates, so dApc\/dt is shown in Fig. 6f.\nFigure 6g shows the Bz component of the IMF, time-lagged\nto the magnetopause. Vertical dotted lines show when Bz\nchanged markedly, usually a transition from positive to neg-\native, that is IMF northward to southward, or vice versa, as\ndiscussed in Sect. 2.1. The vertical dot-dashed lines show\nthe onsets of the auroral brightenings and substorm breakups,\nalso indicated in Figs. 2 and 3.\nFirst, we discuss the variations in the polar cap area. At\nthe start of the interval, the IMF is oriented southward, sug-\ngesting that low-latitude dayside reconnection should be cre-\nating new open flux, and indeed the area of the polar cap\nincreases between 09:00 and 10:15 UT. Following the onset\nof the first auroral brightening (AB1), the polar cap shrinks\nbetween 10:20 and 10:50 UT, indicating that reconnection in\nthe magnetotail is destroying open flux. There is a brief re-\ncovery of the polar cap area between 10:50 and 11:05 UT,\nsuggesting that tail reconnection has ceased and dayside re-\nconnection is still ongoing as the IMF is directed southwards.\nThereafter, the IMF turns northward, suggesting a cessation\nof dayside reconnection, and the polar cap area remains uni-\nform until\u223c11:30 UT. At this time the first substorm breakup\n(SB1) occurs, and we might expect the polar cap to shrink\nas nightside reconnection commences. This is found to be\nthe case, with the polar cap shrinking rapidly from some\n1.5 \u00d7 107 km2 to close to 0.5 \u00d7 107 km2, that is to a third\nof its initial size, over the next 100 min. There is a short pe-\nriod during this interval, between 12:15 and 12:30 UT, when\nthe IMF turns southward once again, and at this time the\npolar cap area recovers somewhat. This is, however, only\na brief pause during the ongoing polar cap shrinkage. At\n13:10 UT the decrease in the polar cap area associated with\nSB1 ceases. This time corresponds approximately to the end\nof the recovery phase of the substorm, as determined from the\nmagnetogram of, say, FSIM (Fig. 3), i.e. magnetotail recon-\n1132 S. E.

Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1133\nnection appears to continue from substorm expansion phase\nonset to the end of the recovery phase, an interval of over an\nhour and a half. A similar finding was reported by Khan et\nal. (2001), in which reconnection signatures were observed\nin the magnetotail some time after significant auroral activ-\nity had subsided. After 13:10 UT, the area of the polar cap\narea remains constant. It is not until the southward turning of\nthe IMF at 13:50 UT that dayside reconnection recommences\nand the polar cap expands. At\u223c14:55 UT the IMF continues\nto be directed southwards, but the rate of expansion of the\npolar cap is diminished, this time corresponding to the sec-\nond auroral brightening (AB2). This slowing of the polar\ncap expansion indicates that magnetotail reconnection is de-\nstroying open flux, though not as quickly as new open flux\nis being created on the dayside. After 15:20 UT, the onset of\nthe second substorm (SB2), the polar cap begins to shrink,\nsuggesting that the closure of open flux in the magnetotail\nnow dominates over the ongoing creation of open flux on the\ndayside.\nAt times when the polar cap is expanding or contract-\ning, the rate of change of area appears relatively uniform,\nas shown by fits-by-eye to the variation in Apc shown in\nFig. 6e; the rate of change of the area represented by these\nfits is also indicated in Fig. 6f. The gradient of these fits is\nrelated through Eq. (1) to the difference in the day- and night-\nside reconnection voltages. During the first substorm growth\nphase, prior to AB1, when IMF Bz \u2248 \u22124 nT, the fit to the\npolar cap growth rate indicates that 8day \u2212 8night \u2248 52 kV.\nIf we assume that no nightside reconnection is occurring\nat this time, i.e. 8night \u2248 0, then 8day \u2248 52 kV. Simi-\nlarly, during the growth phase of the second substorm, when\nBz \u2248 \u22127 nT, we can estimate that 8day \u2248 111 kV prior\nto AB2. Two recent studies of the growth rate of the po-\nlar cap during southward IMF estimated 8day \u2248 160 kV for\nBz \u2248 \u221210 nT (Milan et al., 2000b) and 8day \u2248 48 kV for\nBz \u2248 \u22124 nT (Milan and Lester, 2001). Taken together, these\nvalues suggest that the rate of reconnection on the dayside\nis dependent on the magnitude of the southward component\nof the IMF, with 8day \u2248 15|Bz| kV, where Bz is expressed\nin nT and Bz < 0 nT. This relationship is similar to the sta-\ntistical findings of Yeoman et al. (2002), who suggested that\n8day \u2248 20|Bz| kV.\nDuring the first substorm expansion and recovery, the de-\ncrease in polar cap area indicates that 8day \u2212 8night \u2248\n\u2212119 kV. If we assume that no low-latitude dayside re-\nconnection is occurring during these intervals as the IMF\nis oriented northward, that is 8day = 0, then 8night \u2248\n119 kV. After the onset of AB2, the expansion associated\nwith the second substorm growth phase is slowed, such that\n8day \u2212 8night \u2248 46 kV. However, the IMF does not change\nmarkedly at this time, so we assume that the dayside re-\nconnection voltage remains unchanged at 8day \u2248 111 kV\n(hence, the dotted fit in Fig. 6e), giving a nightside reconnec-\ntion voltage of 8night \u2248 65 kV. After substorm breakup SB2,\n8day \u2212 8night \u2248 \u221223 kV; if the dayside reconnection rate\nis again assumed to remain undiminished, this indicates that\n8night \u2248 134 kV. We see, then, that the rate of reconnection\non the nightside during the auroral brightening AB2 (65 kV)\nis only half of that ongoing during the expansion phases of\nthe two substorms (111 and 134 kV, respectively). The sit-\nuation is not so clear following AB1, as the IMF is highly\nvariable at this time, so it is difficult to estimate 8day.\nAs suggested above, when the IMF is directed northwards\nand no substorm-associated reconnection is ongoing, within\nintervals 11:05\u201311:30 and 13:10\u201313:50 UT, the area of the\npolar cap remains constant. This suggests that open flux is\nnot closed by high-latitude reconnection at these times; in-\nstead, we anticipate that lobe-stirring, a circulation of the\nopen flux, is excited (see also our schematic in Fig. 5). Clo-\nsure of open flux is only expected if individual interplanetary\nmagnetic field lines reconnect with both northern and south-\nern lobes (e.g. Cowley, 1981), a situation that should only\narise if the IMF has no significant By component; this is not\nthe case during the present interval.\nExamination of Fig. 6a\u2013d reveals, as might be expected,\nthat the response of the OCB to changes in polar cap area\nwas not uniform at all local times. One of the motivations of\nthe present study was to examine how well the OCB latitude\nin different MLT sectors characterizes the OCB at all local\ntimes, i.e. if observations of the OCB are available at one lo-\ncation only, and the polar cap is assumed to be circular, how\naccurate is the estimate of the polar cap area. To this end, su-\nperimposed on each panel is a dot-dashed line representing\nthe latitude of the boundary of a circular polar cap, centred\non the geomagnetic pole, of equivalent area to the simultane-\nous estimate of Apc. In effect this shows how distorted the\npolar cap is from a circle, and how far its centre is shifted\nfrom the pole. In the noon sector the OCB is generally found\nat a higher latitude than the equivalent circular OCB (which\nwe will refer to as the equivalent circular boundary or ECB).\nMoreover, the range of latitudes over which the noon OCB\nmoves (\u223c5\u25e6) is much less than would be the case for a cir-\ncular polar cap (\u223c10\u25e6). In the midnight sector the boundary\nmoves much more rapidly than the leisurely meanderings of\nthe noon OCB, and is sometimes equatorward (usually prior\nto substorm breakup), or sometimes poleward (during sub-\nstorm breakup) of the ECB. Indeed, while the noon OCB\nmoves only slowly with time, the midnight OCB responds\nrapidly to the onset of dayside coupling or substorm breakup.\nThe dawn and dusk OCBs are found to match the ECB rela-\ntively closely, especially after 11:00 UT.\nThese results are shown in another format in Fig. 7a\u2013d.\nHere, the latitude of the OCB along each of the four merid-\nians is plotted as a function of polar cap area. The dotted\ncurve superimposed on each panel shows the ECB latitude\nas a function of Apc, which, by definition, is the same at all\nlocal times. Least-squares fits between the OCB latitude 3\nand Apc are shown by solid lines and quantified at the bottom\nof each panel. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the smallest spread is\nfound in the noon sector, though here a point measurement\nof the latitude of the OCB, extrapolated to all local times,\nwould, in general, lead to an underestimate of the polar cap\narea. The large spread along the midnight meridian is due to\nthe large and rapid motions of the OCB in response to sub-\n1134 S. E.

Positive displacements are towards noon and dusk, respectively.\nstorm phenomena. A large spread is also found along the\ndusk and to a lesser extent the dawn meridians, mainly as\na consequence of the overall shift of the polar cap towards\ndawn or dusk that will be described below. Interestingly, at\nsmall polar cap areas the OCB in each local time sector ap-\nproaches the ECB, i.e. the smaller the polar cap, the more\ncircular and centred on the geomagnetic pole it becomes.\nFigure 7e\u2013f show the displacement of the centroid of the po-\nlar cap from the geomagnetic pole, along the noon-midnight\nand dawn-dusk meridians, respectively, as a function of UT;\nhere, displacements towards noon and dusk are positive. It\nis found that on average, the centroid of the polar cap is dis-\nplaced from the pole towards the nightside by of the order\nof 1\u25e6 of latitude, consistent with previous reports. There is\na significant variation in the displacement, however, gener-\nally between the values of 0\u25e6 and 2\u25e6. The centroid appears\nto move towards the nightside during the substorm growth\nphase (09:00 to 10:00 UT and 13:30 to 14:50 UT), and re-\nturns towards the pole following significant nightside auro-\nral activity (following each auroral brightening and substorm\nbreakup). Along the dawn-dusk meridian there is also a sig-\nnificant displacement, towards dawn prior to 11:00 UT and\ntowards dusk after 15:00 UT. It might be expected that such\na shift is caused by the east-west component of the IMF (e.g.\nCowley et al., 1991) and yet By is negative during both these\nintervals.\n2.4 Estimating the dayside reconnection voltage from radar\nmeasurements\nAs suggested in the Introduction, the day- or nightside recon-\nnection voltages can, in principle, be directly estimated from\nmeasurements of the convection flow across the open\/closed\nfield line boundary. This is not possible throughout most of\nthe interval of study, as the radar backscatter coverage is not\nsufficient. However, after 14:00 UT radar backscatter is ob-\nS. E.

(b) Similar to panel (a), though\nshowing the radar observations from the\n(west to east) Saskatoon, Stokkseyri,\nand Pykkvib\u00e6r radars. The potential so-\nlution and OCB are the same in (a) and\n(b). (c) The reconnection electric field\ndetermined from the plasma drift per-\npendicular to the OCB. The integral of\nthis along the boundary between 05 and\n19 MLT is shown in the top right-hand\ncorner.\nserved at almost all local times between 06 and 18 MLT (see,\nfor example, Fig. 4f), and hence, an estimate of the dayside\nreconnection voltage can be made. Below, we employ these\nradar measurements of the convection flow, in conjunction\nwith our knowledge of the motion of the OCB, to estimate\nthe dayside reconnection voltage during the growth phase of\nthe second substorm, and compare this with our previous es-\ntimate of\u223c111 kV determined from the rate of growth of the\npolar cap, for which estimate we assumed that no nightside\nreconnection was taking place.\nFigure 8 shows the line-of-sight plasma drift estimates\nmade by the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars at\n14:46 UT. This time was selected for illustration as it is typ-\nical of the observations made during the growth phase of\nthe second substorm. For the sake of clarity, the observa-\ntions are shown in two separate panels: panel (a) contains\nthe measurements from the three radars included in Fig. 4,\nwhereas panel (b) shows their corresponding radar twins.\nPositive and negative velocities correspond to flow towards\nand away from each radar, respectively. A thick line indi-\ncates the location of the OCB, estimated from the equator-\nward edge of high spectral width radar backscatter, as dis-\ncussed previously. To determine the dayside reconnection\nvoltage, it is necessary to integrate the reconnection electric\nfield at all points along this boundary, which is given by the\ncomponent of plasma drift perpendicular to the boundary. To\nconstruct the two-dimensional flow pattern from the line-of-\nsight velocities, from which the reconnection electric field\ncan be estimated, we employ the analysis technique devel-\noped by Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998). This technique de-\ntermines the solution for the distribution of electrostatic po-\ntential expressed as a series expansion in spherical harmon-\nics (in our case, of order of 6), constrained by the line-of-\nsight measurements of the radars. Contours of the electro-\nstatic potential so derived are superimposed on Fig. 8a and\nb, which in effect represent convection flow streamlines. In\nregions where no radar backscatter is present the potential\nsolution is driven by a statistical convection model, which\nmay not accurately reflect the instantaneous flows occurring\nin the ionosphere. However, in regions where backscatter is\npresent, thus constraining the solution, the contours repre-\nsent a flow pattern that accurately reflects the line-of-sight\nmeasurements. The great advantage of this technique is that,\nsince the solution is an analytic function, the potential or\nelectric field can be calculated at any arbitrary location, un-\nlimited by the spatial resolution or occurrence of the radar\nbackscatter. This makes the determination of the boundary-\nparallel electric field (boundary-normal plasma drift) at all\n1136 S. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles\npoints along the boundary extremely straightforward. This\ngives us the reconnection electric field in the Earth\u2019s frame,\nbut we are really interested in the electric field in the bound-\nary\u2019s rest frame, so we must take the motion of the boundary\ninto account. It is here that the largest uncertainty enters our\ncalculations, as determination of the instantaneous boundary\nvelocity is difficult. However, this can be interpolated from\nthe motion of our boundary identifications, and from this we\nfind the boundary speed to be close to 160 m s\u22121 (represent-\ning an electric field of 8 mV m\u22121) along most of its length\nin the MLT range of interest. The variation with MLT of the\nsum of the convection and boundary motion contributions to\nthe reconnection electric field is shown in Fig. 8c. The re-\nconnection voltage is the integral of the reconnection electric\nfield, and between 05 and 19 MLT this is found to be 104 kV,\nin good agreement with the estimate of 111 kV from the rate\nof growth of the polar cap at this time. As mentioned above,\nthe estimate of the boundary motion speed is the largest un-\ncertainty factor in this calculation: an increase of 10 m s\u22121 in\nthe speed of the equatorward motion of the boundary would\nincrease the estimate of the dayside reconnection voltage by\n2.5 kV. In addition, there may be a small additional contri-\nbution to the dayside reconnection voltage from earlier and\nlater local times than those considered, but insufficient radar\ncoverage does not allow us to quantify this.\nThe electric field measurements themselves are of inter-\nest. It is clear from Fig. 8c that the reconnection electric\nfield maximizes in the pre-noon sector, between 06 and 12\nMLT, consistent with the prevailing IMF orientation, that\nis By < 0 nT. We can consider this to be the convection\nthroat, and indeed it is in this region that the most mani-\nfest signatures of bursty reconnection are observed, as will\nbe described in Sect. 2.5. In addition, the closest satellite\noverpass (Fig. 4f) shows a dispersed ion signature in this\nlocal time sector. However, the electric field remains non-\nzero at all points along the boundary considered, from which\nwe can deduce that reconnection is taking place at most lo-\ncal times along the dayside magnetopause. This is consis-\ntent with the observation of magnetosheath-like precipitation\nalong all dayside portions of the OCB sampled by the over-\npassing satellites (see also Fig. 5). That reconnection can ex-\ntend to the flanks of the magnetopause has previously been\nsuggested by Milan et al. (2000b), who showed ionospheric\nreconnection signatures extending from noon to 18 MLT for\nBy > 0 nT, and the observations of Kawano and Russell\n(1996) which show magnetopause reconnection signatures as\nfar tailwards as X = \u221210RE .\nMuch of the flow crossing the OCB has a large sunward\ncomponent, especially in the post-noon sector, placing the\nconvection reversal boundaries (or focii of the twin-cell po-\ntential pattern) within the polar cap, possibly contrary to\nexpectations. However, this picture is consistent with the\nparadigm of Lockwood (1997), in which the merging gap\nis suggested to be located at lower latitude and to be much\nbroader in MLT extent than previous estimates based on \u201ctra-\nditional\u201d interpretations of low altitude particle precipitation\ncusp signatures (e.g. Newell and Meng, 1992). Indeed, there\nis considerable similarity between our Fig. 8 and Fig. 1b of\nLockwood (1997). If anything, the paradigm of Lockwood\nwould suggest that the true location of the OCB might lie\na small distance equatorwards of our estimate, as no signa-\ntures of the coupling taking place at the magnetopause can\nreach the ionosphere in less than one Alfve\u00b4n travel-time, of\nthe order of 1 or 2 min, in which time magnetic field lines\nthreading this region have convected some distance pole-\nwards (see, also, Rodger and Pinnock, 1997; Oksavik et\nal., 2000; Chisham et al., 2002). This usually corresponds\nto only a fraction of a degree, however, negligible for our\npresent purposes.\n2.5 Signatures of bursty dayside reconnection\nOf perennial interest to studies of the coupling between the\nsolar wind and the magnetosphere is whether dayside re-\nconnection occurs quasi-continuously or in episodic bursts.\nMuch evidence now supports there being a significant bursty\ncomponent to reconnection, from observations of flux trans-\nfer events (FTEs) at the magnetopause (e.g. Russell and\nElphic, 1978, 1979; Haerendel et al., 1978; Kawano and\nRussell, 1996), to transient auroral and convection signa-\ntures in the dayside ionosphere (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1986,\n1998; Provan et al., 1998; Lockwood et al., 1989). Re-\ncently, Milan et al. (2000b) presented combined Polar UVI\nand SuperDARN observations of global-scale reconnection\nbursts, manifested as poleward-moving auroral forms ex-\ntending across 7 h of MLT of the post-noon polar cap bound-\nary. Similar signatures are apparent during the present inter-\nval, and we now turn our discussion to these.\nThe study of Milan et al. (2000b) showed post-noon re-\nconnection signatures during an interval of IMF By > 0 nT.\nPre-noon auroral observations were not available during that\nstudy, and it has been a matter of some speculation as to\nwhether reconnection signatures should be observed to ex-\ntend along the whole dayside OCB (see McWilliams et al.,\n2001). In the present study, we have UVI images and Super-\nDARN observations which cover the whole dayside region,\nallowing us to investigate this question more fully. There are\ntwo intervals during which we expect dayside reconnection\nsignatures to be present, that is during the growth phases of\nthe two substorms, especially 09:00\u201310:00 UT and 13:50\u2013\n16:00 UT. Unfortunately, during the first of these intervals\nthere is scant radar backscatter and during the second the\ndayside UV aurora are swamped by dayglow, so in neither\nof these instances can we compare the reconnection signa-\ntures observed by the two techniques. However, individually\nthe observations are of interest.\nFigure 9 shows three UVI images from the growth phase\nof the first substorm. In the first image a spur is seen develop-\ning in the dawn sector auroral oval (indicated by an arrow),\nwhich extends a few degrees of latitude into the polar cap. In\nthe next two images the evolution of this feature can be fol-\nlowed, that is a westwards expansion of the feature around\nthe auroral oval. In the final image, a roughly east-west ori-\nented auroral form is seen, situated poleward of the main au-\nS. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles 1137\nFig. 9. Three UVI images from the growth phase of the first substorm, showing the development of a \u201ccusp bifurcation\u201d feature in the dawn\nsector.\nroral oval within the polar cap, and connected to the oval at\nits western edge near 5 MLT. It is uncertain how far into the\nnoon sector this feature extends as a consequence of day-\nglow. This feature closely resembles the \u201ccusp bifurcations\u201d\ndiscussed by Milan et al. (2000b), and which they interpreted\nas the UVI counterpart of poleward-moving auroral forms\nidentified from the ground (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1998), an\naccepted signature of bursty reconnection. In other words,\nthis auroral feature is a result of magnetosheath plasma in-\njected into the ionosphere by a reconnection burst, and delin-\neates the region of new open flux created by the burst. The\nwestwards expansion of the feature is interpreted as a motion\nof the reconnection site along the magnetopause flank. The\ncusp bifurcations of Milan et al. were observed in the post-\nnoon sector for IMF By > 0 nT. In the present case, the cusp\nbifurcation is seen in the pre-noon sector for By < 0 nT (as is\nthe convection throat, revealed by the SuperDARN observa-\ntions discussed in Sect. 2.4). Thus, a significant dependence\nis found on the By component of the IMF, as expected for re-\nconnection phenomena. Interestingly, no similar signature is\ndiscernable in the post-noon sector, contrary to the prediction\nof McWilliams et al. (2001).\nDuring the second substorm growth phase, a series of\npoleward-moving features is observed within the Super-\nDARN backscatter, especially by the Kapuskasing radar be-\ntween 13:50 and 15:00 UT, though also in the Goose Bay\nobservations (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2). These fea-\ntures appear within the convection throat region described\nabove, and are found in association with dispersed ion sig-\nnatures in the particle measurements (see Sect. 2.4). Such\npoleward-moving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs) have previ-\nously been identified as the signature of transient reconnec-\ntion bursts by Provan et al. (1998), and were shown by Milan\net al. (2000b) to be co-located with the UVI cusp bifurcations\ndescribed above. In addition, Lockwood et al. (2001) found\nsuch PMRAFs and cusp bifurcations to be associated with\n\u201ccusp ion steps\u201d observed at high altitude, another signature\nof pulsed reconnection. Perhaps the most direct evidence\nlinking PMRAFs with bursty reconnection is the demonstra-\ntion of their association with flux transfer event (FTE) signa-\ntures at the magnetopause (Neudegg et al., 1999, 2000; Wild\net al., 2001). In the present study, the observation of PM-\nFig. 10. Latitude-time-velocity plot of the observations from beam\n3 of the Hankasalmi radar showing signs of PMRAF-like signatures\nin the dusk sector (arrows).\nRAFs in association with southward IMF and a growth of\nthe polar cap area \u2013 as also found by Milan et al. (2000b) \u2013\nis fully consistent with the bursty reconnection interpretation\nof these features.\nAlthough the most prominent radar signatures of pulsed\nreconnection are found in the convection throat region in the\npre-noon sector, there is evidence that reconnection occur-\nring even some distance from the convection throat can be\nbursty in nature. Figure 10 shows a latitude-time plot of the\nDoppler shift observed in beam 3 of the Hankasalmi radar\n(the eastern-most radar in Fig. 8a), in which the poleward\nregion of backscatter, corresponding to the vicinity of the\nOCB, displays PMRAF-like signatures. These are, however,\nof much smaller scale than the PMRAFs observed in the\npre-noon sector by the Kapuskasing radar, that is, there is\na considerable asymmetry between reconnection signatures\nin the dawn and dusk sectors. It is perhaps for this reason\nthat no clear signature of bursty reconnection was apparent in\nthe post-noon UVI observations of the first substorm growth\nphase (Fig. 9). Such an asymmetry in reconnection signa-\ntures between dawn and dusk is easy to understand in rela-\ntion to Fig. 8: the reconnection electric field is much greater\nin the dawn sector than in the dusk sector; also the convec-\ntion flow across the OCB is directed almost meridionally in\nthe pre-noon sector and almost zonally post-noon. Similar\n1138 S. E. Milan et al.: Variations in polar cap area during two substorm cycles\nconsiderations regarding the interhemispheric asymmetry of\npulsed reconnection signatures have been discussed by Milan\nand Lester (2001).\n3 Conclusions\nPolar UVI, the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN chain,\nDMSP F13 and F14, NOAA-12 and FAST measurements\nhave been combined to estimate the location of the polar\ncap boundary at all local times, and to track the change in\npolar cap area through the course of two substorms. The\nsatellite precipitation measurements are interpreted such that\nhigh energy (> few keV) particles are located on closed field\nlines, whereas structured low energy (< 1 keV) particles\nare of magnetosheath origin and located on open field lines;\nthe poleward boundary of the high energy particles is taken\nto be a proxy for the OCB. In this scheme, high spectral\nwidth radar backscatter on the dayside appears co-located\nwith magnetosheath-origin precipitation, and especially dur-\ning southward IMF conditions the equatorward boundary is\ninterpreted as the OCB proxy. Finally, on the nightside, the\npoleward edge of the main UV auroral luminosity is assumed\nto map closely to the OCB.\nThe polar cap is found to expand when the IMF is directed\nsouthwards, the substorm growth phase. The polar cap con-\ntracts during the substorm expansion phase, the contraction\nstarting almost immediately (within 10 min) after the onset\nof breakup. Polar cap contraction continues throughout the\nrecovery phase; indeed the decrease in polar cap area can\ncontinue for up to 100 min after onset, that is for some con-\nsiderable time after visual manifestations of breakup have\nfaded. During northward IMF, after nightside reconnection\nhas ceased, the polar cap remains of uniform size, suggest-\ning that high-latitude reconnection is not associated with the\nclosure of open flux in the present example. The polar cap\narea was found to vary by a factor of three during the interval\nof study. The rate of change of polar cap area allows for day-\nside and nightside reconnection voltages to be estimated. Ap-\nproximately, the reconnection rate associated with substorms\nis 120 kV, and with significant auroral brightenings is 60 kV.\nWhen the IMF is directed southwards, the dayside reconnec-\ntion rate is suggested to be \u223c 15|Bz| kV, where IMF Bz is\nexpressed in nT.\nOur estimate of the dayside reconnection rate, determined\nfrom the rate of polar cap expansion, is found to be consistent\nwith the reconnection voltage determined along the dayside\nOCB by radar plasma drift measurements, lending credence\nto the convection excitation paradigm of Siscoe and Huang\n(1985), Cowley and Lockwood (1992), Cowley et al. (1992),\nand Lockwood and Cowley (1992). Moreover, these results\nsuggest that southwards-oriented IMF reconnection occurs\nacross the majority of the dayside magnetopause, though\nwith a greater reconnection electric field in the pre-noon sec-\ntor for IMF By < 0 nT, with presumably the opposite hold-\ning for By > 0 nT. We find evidence for pulsed reconnection\nin the radar observations in both the dawn and dusk sectors,\nthough those in the convection throat are most prominent.\nAs far as using point measurements of the OCB, general-\nized to all local times to estimate the area of the polar cap,\nwe have demonstrated that the noon sector OCB shows the\nmost consistent variation in latitude with polar cap area: the\nrelationship shown in Fig. 7c may be used to calibrate es-\ntimates of Apc based on dayside observations of the OCB.\nHowever, we must investigate more of such cases to deter-\nmine how generally this result holds, or in other words, how\ndistorted the polar cap becomes under different loading and\nunloading conditions.\nThe question of defining the polar cap boundary from\nionospheric observations is clearly still not fully answered.\nOne drawback of the current study is the lack of regular\nsatellite overpasses of the nightside auroral oval. The one\npass available during the interval demonstrated a close asso-\nciation between the poleward edge of the expanding auroral\nbulge and the OCB. However, there is still some uncertainty\nregarding the location of the OCB relative to the nightside lu-\nminosity during more quiescent periods. We intend to study\nthis and related problems in more detail in the future, in-\ncluding the break-down of the relationship between HF radar\nbackscatter and the OCB for northwards IMF. SuperDARN\nwill play an increasing role in studies of the polar cap area\nas there are now nine radars operating in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, covering an MLT extent of approximately 19 h.\nAcknowledgements.
