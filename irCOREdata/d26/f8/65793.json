Among the well-\ncharacterised peptide toxins are those derived from the\nvenom of scorpions belonging to the family Buthidae.\nThese toxins are classified into two groups, based on their\nmolecular size and activity. The first group contains short\ntoxins (30\u201340 amino acid residues), with 3\u20134 disulphide\nbridges, which principally affect voltage-dependent potas-\nsium channels and conductance calcium-activated potas-\nsium channels [3,4]. The second group contains longer\ntoxins (60\u201370 amino acid residues), cross-linked by 4\ndisulphide bridges, which mainly effect voltage-depend-\nent sodium channels of excitable cells [5,6]. Despite the\nsimilarity of invertebrate and vertebrate ion channels,\nmany scorpion neurotoxins exhibit specificity towards\nparticular species or groups of species. This specificity of\naction gives scorpion toxins, and other proteins with sim-\nilar properties, significant potential in the development of\nsafer alternatives to broad spectrum insecticides. Recom-\nbinant baculovirus expressing scorpion toxins have been\nproposed as insect control agents, and have given promis-\ning results in laboratory, glasshouse and field, although\nthis has not led to wide-scale adoption of the technology\n(reviewed in [7]).\nThe isolation and characterization of a novel short, lepi-\ndopteran-selective toxin (ButaIT; also referred to as\nBtChl2; Swiss-Prot [P81761]) from the venom of the\nSouth Indian red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) was\nreported by Wudayagiri et al. [8]. Injection of Heliothis\nvirescens with ButaITA (purified to homogeneity by hplc;\nfraction CM-IV-6A) was shown to cause larval mortality\nthrough progressive, irreversible, flaccid paralysis at a\ndose of 1 \u00b5g\/100 mg, but was non-toxic to blowfly larvae\nat the same dose, or mice at a dose of 3 \u00b5g\/g body weight.\nThe mature form of ButaIT is a single polypeptide of 37\namino acid residues, cross-linked by four disulfide\nbridges, that exhibits high sequence similarity to other\nshort toxins. The sequence of a cDNA encoding a precur-\nsor form of ButaIT (referred to as BtChl2) has been lodged\nin the databases (Genbank [AF481881]); the precursor is\na polypeptide of 62 amino acids, which is modified by\nremoval of a 24-residue N-terminal signal peptide, and a\nsingle residue from the C-terminus, to give the mature\nprotein.\nSnowdrop lectin (GNA; Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) has\nbeen shown to bind to the gut epithelium when fed to\ninsects, and can be detected in the circulatory system [9].\nThe use of GNA as a carrier to transport fused proteins to\nthe haemolymph of target species after oral ingestion has\nbeen demonstrated, and can result in insecticidal effects\nnot shown by ingestion of either the lectin or the fused\nprotein separately. When a fusion protein containing\nGNA and a C-terminally fused insect neuropeptide (Man-\nduca sexta allatostatin) was fed to lepidopteran larvae,\nreductions in survival, and in growth and feeding, were\nobserved [10] In addition, fusion protein could be\ndetected in the larval haemolymph by immunoassay.\nSimilarly, GNA has been used to deliver an N-terminally\nfused insect-specific neurotoxin, Sfl1, derived from the\nvenom glands of the spider Segestria florentina, to the\nblood of target species, causing insecticidal effects [11].\nThis paper reports on the production, purification and\nbiological activities of a recombinant fusion protein,\nButaIT\/GNA, containing the ButaIT polypeptide fused to\nthe N-terminus of snowdrop lectin, as a means of deliver-\ning ButaIT to insects via oral ingestion. The ButaIT\/GNA\nfusion protein was toxic towards lepidopteran larvae both\nwhen injected into the haemolymph, and when fed in\nartifical diet. Direct evidence for the delivery of intact\nButaIT\/GNA to the haemolymph of orally-fed insects is\npresented. In contrast to the earlier results showing that\nButaIT was specifically toxic to lepidopteran insects, the\nButaIT\/GNA fusion protein was found to be toxic towards\ninsects of different orders.\nResults\nConstruction of a synthetic gene encoding the red scorpion \nneurotoxin ButaIT and assembly of expression constructs\nA synthetic gene containing the entire coding sequence for\nthe mature ButaIT polypeptide (as given in Genbank\n[AF481881]) was assembled from overlapping oligonu-\ncleotides. Each of the two complementary strands of the\ngene contained four 30-mers and one 15-mer, arranged so\nthat overlaps of 15 bases between complementary por-\ntions of the oligos were present. The oligonucleotides\nwere phosphorylated prior to annealing, and the desired\nproduct was amplified by PCR after annealing and ligat-\ning, using the 15-mer oligonucleotides at the 5' end of\neach strand as primers. A DNA fragment corresponding to\nthe correct size for the complete product was obtained,\nand was excised from gel, cloned in an intermediate vec-\ntor, and verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting frag-\nment corresponded to the desired coding sequence, with\nadditional restriction sites introduced at the ends to allow\nfor subsequent cloning.\nThe ButaIT coding sequence was assembled into two con-\nstructs for expression of proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris\nusing the shuttle expression vector pGAPZ\u03b1B. The first\nconstruct contained ButaIT alone, and the second\nencoded a fusion protein in which ButaIT is fused to the\nN-terminus of residues 1 \u2013 105 of mature GNA via a 3\namino acid linker peptide (Fig. 1). Both constructs were\narranged so that the recombinant proteins were produced\nBMC Biotechnology 2006, 6:18 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6750\/6\/18\nPage 3 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAssembly of the expression constructs for ButaIT and ButaIT\/GNAFigure 1\nAssembly of the expression constructs for ButaIT and ButaIT\/GNA.

The final protein product for ButaIT is predicted to\ncontain a 9 amino acid C-terminal extension, containing\nthe (his)6 tag, and is predicted to have 2 extra alanine res-\nidues at the N-terminus after removal of the prepro-\nsequence, The predicted protein product for ButaIT\/GNA\ncontains a C-terminal extension of 23 amino acids,\nincluding a myc epitope tag and the (his)6 tag (Fig. 1).\nConstructs were assembled by restriction\/ligation and\ncloning in E. coli, and were verified by DNA sequencing.\nExpression and purification of recombinant ButaIT and \nButaIT\/GNA\nDNA from verified clones of the expression construct plas-\nmids was linearised and transformed into competent cells\nof a protease-deficient Pichia pastoris strain. Since the\nexpression vector contains a constitutive yeast promoter,\nclones selected as positive for transformation by antibiotic\nresistance and colony PCR were tested for expression of\nrecombinant proteins in small-scale cultures. Culture\nsupernatants were assayed for the presence of recom-\nbinant proteins by immuno-dot blot and Western blot-\nting, using antibodies to the C-terminal tags, or in the case\nof the ButaIT\/GNA fusion, to GNA. Clones expressing\nrecombinant proteins at higher levels (relative to other\nclones) were selected for further study.\nFor production of recombinant proteins, selected yeast\nclones expressing ButaIT and ButaIT\/GNA were grown in\na bench-top fermenter. ButaIT and ButaIT\/GNA were par-\ntially purified from culture supernatant by hydrophobic\ninteraction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose.\nRecombinant ButaIT was produced in relatively low yield\n(<1 mg\/l culture). The partially purified material con-\ntained a polypeptide of estimated mol. wt. approx. 10,000\nas the major component (fig. 2A); when a gel separation\nwas analysed by Western blotting, and probing with with\nanti-(his)6 antibodies, the band gave a strong and specific\nreaction, showing that this band represents recombinant\nButaIT. The discrepancy in size between predicted and\nestimated mol. wts. for this polypeptide is consistent with\nprevious results in which small toxin polypeptides with\nhigh cysteine content show anomalous migration on SDS-\nPAGE.\nButaIT\/GNA was produced at a yield of 25\u201335 mg\/l cul-\nture medium, and was the major protein component of\nthe material eluted from the hydrophobic interaction col-\numn by a water wash. Further purification of ButaIT\/GNA\nby gel filtration was carried out to remove contaminating\nyeast proteins (fig. 2B). Analysis of purified ButaIT\/GNA\nby SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C) shows one major component of\napprox. 18.5 kDa, which is close to the predicted molecu-\nlar weight of 19.4 kDa. A minor component (weakly\nstained band) of approx. 17 kDa is also present. Both\nbands were immunoreactive towards anti-GNA antibod-\nies (data not presented), but only the major component\nreacted with anti-(his)6 antibodies. The indicated size of\nthese polypeptides, and their immunoreactivity, suggest\nthat the majority of ButaIT\/GNA is full-length protein\nwith the C-terminal extension intact, with a small propor-\ntion of ButaIT\/GNA from which the C-terminal his tag has\nbeen removed. Recombinant ButaIT\/GNA agglutinated\nrabbit erythrocytes at a comparable concentration to\nnative GNA (50 \u00b5g\/ml for ButaIT\/GNA, vs. approx. 10 \u00b5g\/\nml for GNA), showing that the lectin part of the fusion\nprotein is functional.\nWhile the ButaIT\/GNA could be produced as intact fusion\nprotein, prolonged exposure to proteases, such as those in\nyeast culture supernatant, resulted in varying amounts\n(normally <50%, as estimated by band staining intensity)\nof proteolytic cleavage. Proteolysis occurred predomi-\nnantly at or near the linker region between ButaIT and\nGNA, and generated a polypeptide, mol. wt. approx.\n12,000, which reacted with anti-GNA and anti-(his)6 anti-\nbodies. When band intensities were compared for the\nsame protein samples between stained gels and Western\nblots, it was apparent that the anti-GNA antibody gave a\nstronger reaction with the 12,000 mol. wt band than with\nthe intact fusion protein; as a consequence, the extent of\ncleavage of the fusion is overestimated in Western blots.\nToxicity of recombinant proteins to tomato moth larvae \nafter injection into the haemocoel\nThe toxicity of recombinant ButaIT was demonstrated by\ninjection into fifth stadium L. oleracea larvae (approx. 30\n\u2013 60 mg). Injection of the partially purified recombinant\nprotein at doses of the order of 1\u201310 \u00b5g caused a decline\nin larval suvival over a period of 7 days, to less than 30%.\nControl survival (buffer-injected, or injected with other\npartially purified recombinant proteins) was >70% over 7\ndays. The effect was dose-dependent, and at high doses of\nButaIT 100% mortality was observed after 3 days, during\nwhich time control survival was >90%. These results could\nnot be compared with previously published data for tox-\nicity of the protein purified from scorpion venom, as the\nrecombinant protein could not be quantified, and\nattempts to purify it further were not successful. However,\nthe data show that expression as a recombinant protein in\nP. pastoris did not abolish the toxicity of ButaIT.\nThe ButaIT\/GNA fusion protein was also toxic when\ninjected into 5th stadium L. oleracea larvae. The major\neffect on mortality was seen during the first two days after\ninjection, after which survival (particularly at higher\ndoses) stabilised.

Delivery of the toxin via this route had\nlittle or no acute toxicity to larvae, but long-term effects on\nlarval survival and development were observed. As shown\nin Fig 4A, survival of larvae fed on diet containing ButaIT\/\nGNA at 4.5% of total protein declined significantly after\nday 8 of the assay, so that only 75% of larvae remained\nalive after 12 days of feeding, compared to 100% of larvae\nfed on control diet. Exposure to the lower dose of ButaIT\/\nGNA did not have a significant effect on survival over a\nsimilar time period. Similarly, exposure to GNA in the diet\nat 5% of total protein had no effect on survival over 12\ndays.\nSurviving larvae fed on the ButaIT\/GNA-containing diets\nshowed a significant reduction in mean larval weight\ncompared to the control diet treatment for all time points\nafter day 4 of the bioassay (ANOVA; p < 0.05), so that by\nday 12 of the bioassay the mean weight of surviving\nButaIT\/GNA-fed larvae (both doses) was approx. 40 %\nless than that recorded for control insects (Fig. 4B). The\nconsumption of diet correlated with larval growth, so that\noverall, ButaIT\/GNA at 4.5 % of total protein caused a\nreduction of approx. 35 % of total diet consumed, com-\npared to control treatment, and ButaIT\/GNA at 2.5 % of\ntotal protein caused a reduction of approx. 30% in diet\nconsumption. Feeding GNA at 5% of total protein in the\ndiet had only marginal, insignificant effects on growth\nand consumption (Fig. 4B).\nPresence of ButaIT\/GNA in tomato moth larval tissues after oral \nadministration\nGut tissue and haemolymph samples were extracted from\nlarvae exposed to ButaIT\/GNA at 2.5 % of dietary protein\nfor 24 h and 8 days, and from larvae exposed ButaIT\/GNA\nat 4.5 % of dietary protein for 12 days. Typically samples\nwere pooled from 3 insects to give 2 \u2013 4 replicates in each\ninstance. Western blot analysis, using anti-GNA antibod-\nies as a probe, was used to verify binding of the fusion pro-\ntein to the guts of orally exposed larvae, and uptake of\nButaIT\/GNA into the haemolymph. Fig. 5 represents a\nsummary of the results obtained. In all cases immunore-\nactivity of two major bands with anti-GNA antibodies was\nobserved in samples from insects fed ButaIT\/GNA, but not\ncontrol insects. These bands, present in both gut and\nhaemolymph samples, correspond in molecular weight to\nthe sizes of ButaIT\/GNA and GNA. The susceptibility of\nfusion proteins based on GNA to proteolytic cleavage in\nthe region of the linker peptide between GNA and the\nfused peptide\/polypeptide has been observed previously\nfor other recombinant fusion proteins [11,12], and has\nbeen noted above for ButaIT\/GNA. When compared to\nstandards, the ButaIT\/GNA fusion protein detected in\nboth gut and blood samples from ButaIT\/GNA-fed larvae\nshowed a reduction in the intensity of the band corre-\nsponding to intact fusion protein, and a concurrent\nincrease in the band corresponding to GNA. The results\nimplied that limited proteolysis of the ButaIT\/GNA fusion\noccurs during ingestion, passage through the gut, and\ntransport to the haemolymph. Analysis of gut contents\nfrom ButaIT\/GNA-fed insects by Western blotting sug-\ngested that most of the proteolytic cleavage of the fusion\nprotein occurred during the digestive processes occurring\nin the gut lumen (fig. 5). Analysis of proteins extracted\nfrom artificial diet showed that the fusion protein was not\nproteolytically cleaved as a result of incorporation into the\nPresence of ButaIT\/GNA fusion protein in gut and haemol-ymph of L. oleracea larvae foll wing feedingFigure 5\nPresence of ButaIT\/GNA fusion protein in gut and \nhaemolymph of L. oleracea larvae following feeding. \nSamples were taken from third stadium L. oleracea larvae fed \nfor 12 days on control diet (C), or diet containing ButaIT\/\nGNA (F; 4.5 mg\/5 g diet).

The fusion protein\nwas fed to insects by incorporation into liquid diet at a\nconcentration of 0.05% (0.5 mg\/ml diet), and its effects\non survival were compared to GNA at a similar concentra-\ntion. Results are shown in fig. 6. Control survival over the\n8-day bioassay was approx. 40%, and at day 6, when all\ninsects on the \"water only\" control had died, was approx.\n50%. Corrected mortality values, based on day 6 of the\nassay, were 64 \u00b1 11% for GNA and 92 \u00b1 5% for ButaIT\/\nGNA; these are significantly different at p < 0.01 (survival\nanalysis). At all times after day 1 the effect of ButaIT on\nsurvival was greater than that of GNA in these bioassays.\nWestern blotting analysis of samples of diet after N. lugens\nfeeding showed that ButaIT\/GNA was stable in the diet\nover a 2-day interval, with only a small amount of prote-\nolysis of the fusion observed (data not presented).\nDiscussion\nButaIT belongs to the sequence family of \"short\" scorpion\ntoxins, which have a common pattern of cysteine residues\nand are thought to share a common core structure, con-\ntaining one \u03b1-helix and three \u03b2-strands [8]. On the basis\nthat there is more sequence variability at the C-terminus\nof these proteins than at the N-terminus, where a com-\npletely conserved cysteine residue is always amino acid\nresidue 2, the ButaIT\/GNA fusion protein was designed\nwith the scorpion toxin N-terminal to the lectin, with the\nexpectation that this orientation would be more likely to\nresult in the fusion protein retaining toxicity. Previous\nfusion proteins based on GNA have shown that the lectin\nfunctionality is retained in both N- and C-terminal\nfusions [10-12]. Expression of the toxin itself as a recom-\nbinant protein containing a C-terminal fusion \"tag\"\nsequence would confirm that C-terminal extensions to\nButaIT did not abolish toxicity. The availability of a com-\nplete cDNA sequence encoding a precursor of ButaIT\nmade assembling a synthetic coding sequence for the\nmature protein a straightforward exercise.\nThe high level of cysteine in ButaIT, which is assumed to\ncontain 4 cys-cys cross-links in a 37-residue protein,\nrequired that an expression system capable of correctly\nforming cys-cys cross-links was used to express the recom-\nbinant protein. The use of Pichia pastoris as an expression\nhost has proved successful in our hands for expressing\nother cysteine-rich cross-linked proteins, such as the spi-\nder venom toxin SflI [11], in a soluble, functional form,\nand is also able to produce functional, soluble plant\nlectins [13]. P. pastoris was thus used as expression host for\nboth ButaIT and the ButaIT\/GNA fusion, with both\nrecombinant proteins engineered for secretion into cul-\nture supernatant. Comparison of the toxicity of recom-\nbinant ButaIT with the material purified from scorpion\nvenom by HPLC [8] was not possible, since only partially\npurified recombinant toxin was available. However, the\nfusion protein was fully purified and the delivered dose\ncould be properly quantified. The ButaIT purified from\nscorpion venom caused induction of progressive, irrevers-\nible paralysis in Heliothis virescens larvae 30 min \u2013 24 h\nafter injection at a dose of 1 \u00b5g\/100 mg insect; in compar-\nison, injection of ButaIT\/GNA at 3 \u2013 13 \u00b5g\/100 mg insect\nin L. oleracea larvae caused mortalities of 40\u201360%. These\ndata suggest that the toxicity of ButaIT in the fusion pro-\ntein may be compromised to some extent, but is not abol-\nished, and the fusion protein is still an effective toxin.\nPrevious studies using recombinant fusion proteins com-\nbining snowdrop lectin (GNA) linked either to the insect\nEffects of purified recombinant proteins on survival of rice brown planthoppeFigure 6\nEffects of purified recombinant proteins on survival \nof rice brown planthopper.

Evidence for\nbinding of the fusion protein to the gut and subsequent\ndelivery to the blood was provided by western analysis of\nsamples taken from fusion-fed larvae. GNA-immunoreac-\ntive protein with a molecular weight consistent with the\nrecombinant ButaIT\/GNA standard was seen to be present\nin both gut and haemolymph samples from fusion-fed L.\noleracea larvae. A degree of proteolytic degradation of the\nfusion was denoted by the increased intensity of an\nimmunoreactive band of the same size as GNA, concur-\nrent with the decreased intensity of the band correspond-\ning to ButaIT\/GNA. The degradation of ingested proteins\nis part of the digestive process. Whilst GNA itself is resist-\nant to gut proteolysis, proteolytic cleavage of linker\nregions, or polypeptides fused to GNA is to be expected\nand has been observed previously [11,12]. Nevertheless,\nsufficient biologically active ButaIT was delivered to the\nblood to produce detrimental effects upon larvae exposed\nto diet containing the fusion protein.\nPrevious studies with SflI\/GNA, a fusion between a spider\nneurotoxin (SflI) from S. florentina and GNA, also demon-\nstrated in vivo biological activity by injection of L. oleracea\nlarvae. SflI\/GNA was seen to cause 40 % mortality 72\nhours after injection of a dose of 18 \u2013 25 \u00b5g\/g insect [11].\nThis level of toxicity is slightly higher than the effects of\nButaIT\/GNA on injection. SflI\/GNA also showed higher\ntoxicity than ButaIT\/GNA when fed to larvae in diet, with\n20% mortality over a 4-day period and an almost com-\nplete inhibition of growth when fed at levels comparable\nto those for ButaIT\/GNA. When SflI\/GNA was fed at lower\nlevels, approx. 1% of total protein, it had no effect on sur-\nvival, but caused a decrease in weight gain similar to that\nobserved for ButaIT\/GNA at approximately 4.5% of total\nprotein. These results are most easily explained by a differ-\nence in sensitivity of L. oleracea larvae to the two toxins,\nSflI and ButaIT, with SflI being more potent. In both cases\nthe analysis of haemolymph after feeding fusion protein\nshowed that intact fusion protein was present as a result\nof GNA-mediated transport across the gut epithelium, and\nthus oral toxicity would depend on the relative activity of\nthe toxin parts of the two fusion proteins. GNA itself has\nno acute toxic effects in short-term feeding assays on well-\ndeveloped larvae.\nThe bioassays in which ButaIT\/GNA was fed to N. lugens\nshow unambiguously that the fusion protein is more toxic\nto these insects than GNA alone. The recombinant protein\nused for these assays shows a similar level of toxicity to\nprevious assays using GNA purified from Galanthus nivalis\nbulbs [14]. The characterisation of ButaIT previously\nreported [8] suggested that this toxin is lepidopteran-spe-\ncific, on the basis of non-toxicity to blowfly larvae. The\npresent results suggest that the specificity of ButaIT may be\nbroader, but could also be interpreted as an effect result-\ning from the fusion of the toxin to GNA. Injection assays\ncarried out with a range of insects have shown that the\nButaIT\/GNA fusion protein is toxic to other non-lepidop-\nteran insects (data not presented), and further work will\nbe required to define the range of pest species for which\nthis fusion protein may be an effective insecticide.\nConclusion\nThe ability of snowdrop lectin (GNA) to act as a carrier\nprotein to direct the transport of attached molecules into\nthe insect haemolymph has been demonstrated by the\nproduction of a recombinant protein containing the lepi-\ndopteran-specific toxin from the South Indian red scor-\npion (Mesobuthus tamulus) (ButaIT) fused N-terminally to\nsnowdrop lectin. The fusion protein (ButaIT\/GNA) was\npurified to more than 90 % homogeneity by hydrophobic\ninteraction chromatography and gel filtration chromatog-\nraphy. Biological activity was confirmed by mortality of\nlarvae of tomato moth (Lacanobia oleracea) injected with\nButaIT\/GNA, as compared to controls injected with buffer\nor GNA (negative controls) or recombinant ButaIT (posi-\ntive control). The fusion protein showed insecticidal activ-\nity when delivered orally to L. oleracea larvae; dietary\nButaIT\/GNA caused a reduction in survival (at higher\ndose) and a significant reduction in larval growth and\nconsumption, as compared to controls. Intact ButaIT\/\nGNA was present in the haemolymph of insects fed on\ndiet containing the fusion protein, showing that transport\nfrom the gut had occurred. The ButaIT\/GNA fusion pro-\ntein was also significantly more toxic than GNA alone\nwhen fed to the homopteran plant pest Nilaparvata lugens\n(rice brown planthopper), suggesting that the ButaIT\ntoxin may have a broader insecticidal specificity than ini-\ntially thought. Fusion proteins of this type have potential\napplications in agriculture, both as insecticide sprays that\ncan be applied exogenously to crops, and as gene products\nthat can be synthesised endogenously by transgenic\nplants.\nMethods\nInsects\nLacanobia oleracea were reared continuously on artificial\ndiet (Bown et al., 1997) at 25\u00b0C under a 16 h:8 h\nlight:dark regime.

Restriction endo-\nnucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and\nPfu DNA polymerase, were supplied by Promega [18].\nPlasmid DNA was prepared using Promega Wizard mini-\nprep kits. GNA was obtained from Vector Laboratories\nInc. or was produced as a recombinant protein in yeast\n[13]. Anti-GNA antibodies, raised in rabbits, were pre-\npared by Genosys Biotechnologies, Cambridge, UK, and\nanti-(His)6 (C-terminal) antibodies were from Invitrogen.\nGeneral molecular biology protocols were as described by\nSambrook and Russell [19] except where otherwise noted.\nAll DNA sequencing was carried out using dideoxynucle-\notide chain termination protocols on Applied Biosystems\nautomated DNA sequencers by the DNA Sequencing Serv-\nice, School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Univer-\nsity of Durham, UK. Sequences were checked and\nassembled using Sequencher software [20] running on\nMac OS computers.\nAssembly of expression constructs for recombinant \nproteins\nThe ButaIT amino acid sequence (Genbank [AF481881])\nwas used as the basis for the assembly of a synthetic\nButaIT gene. Each strand (i.e. coding and complementary\nstrands) of the sequence encoding the mature ButaIT\nchain (114 nucleotides) was subdivided into 5 fragments,\nin such a way that each fragment overlapped neighbour-\ning fragments on the complementary strand by 10\u201315\nbases. Ten oligonucleotide primers based on these frag-\nments were synthesised, and used in an assembly reaction\nof the full mature ButaIT coding sequence.\nThe oligonucleotides used were as follows:\nCoding strand:\n5'-TCGCCTGCAGCAAGGT-3'\n5'-GTGGTCCTTGCTTTACAACTGATCCTCAAA-3'\n5'-CACAAGCCAAGTGTAGTGAGTGTTGTGGGC-3'\n5'-GAAAGGGTGGAGTATGCAAGGGCCCACAAT-3'\n5'-GTATCTGTGGTATACAATACGTCGACCGGCAA-3'\nComplementary strand:\n5'-TTGCCGGTCGACGTATT-3'\n5'-GTATACCACAGATACATTGTGGGCCCTTGC-3'\n5'-ATACTCCACCCTTTCGCCCACAACACTCAC-3'\n5'-TACACTTGGCTTGTGTTTGAGGATCAGTTG-3'\n5'-TAAAGCAAGGACCACACCTTGCTGCAGGCGA-3\"\nThe primers at the 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequence\ncontained Pst I, and Sal I restriction sites (underlined),\nrespectively, which were used to allow subsequent cloning\nof the ButaIT gene into the expression vector pGAPZ\u03b1B.\nAll primers were individually 5'-phosphorylated using\nenzyme T4 polynucleotide kinase. An equimolar solution\nof phosphorylated primers in standard T4-DNA ligase\nbuffer (without adenosine triphosphate; ATP or dithioth-\nreitol; DTT), was prepared in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l. The\nmix was boiled for 10 min, to denature secondary struc-\ntures, and slowly cooled to room temperature to allow\nprimers to anneal. After addition of ATP, DTT and DNA\nligase, a ligation reaction was carried out for 24 h at 16\u00b0C.\nA PCR reaction was then performed, using sense and anti-\nsense primers at the 5' and 3' ends of the ButaIT gene, to\nobtain sufficient DNA for cloning into the intermediate\nvector PCR 2.1. The resulting clones were verified by\nsequencing. Subsequently, the ButaIT coding sequence\nwas excised as a Pst I\/Sal I fragment from PCR2.1, and\ncloned into the expression vector pGAPZ\u03b1B to create\nButaIT- pGAPZ\u03b1B.\nTo create a construct encoding the ButaIT\/GNA fusion\nprotein, the sequence encoding the mature GNA peptide\n(105 residues), derived from LECGNA2 cDNA [15] (Gen-\nbank [A18023]), was excised from a previously generated\nconstruct (SFI1\/GNA-pGAPZ\u03b1A, [11]) by restriction\ndigestion (5' Not I\/3' Xba I) and ligated into ButaIT-pGAP-\nZ\u03b1B, which had been digested with the same enzymes.\nThe expressed protein derived from this construct is\ndescribed in fig. 1.\nThe construct for expressing recombinant GNA as a con-\ntrol also contained amino acids 1\u2013105 of the mature GNA\npolypeptide (previously shown to produce a fully active\nlectin) inserted as an EcoR I \u2013 Xba I fragment in the vector\npGAPZ\u03b1A; the expressed protein, after post-translational\ncleavage of the vector-encoded \u03b1-factor prepro-sequence\nwas predicted to contain two extra residues at the N-termi-\nnus (EF...) and one at the C-terminus (...D); these extra\nresidues have been shown not to affect activity.\nBMC Biotechnology 2006, 6:18 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6750\/6\/18\nPage 11 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nExpression and purification of ButaIT and ButaIT\/GNA\nConstructs for expressing recombinant proteins were\ntransformed into P. pastoris (SMD1168H strain; ButaIT\nand ButaIT\/GNA or X33 strain; GNA) according to the\nprotocols supplied by Invitrogen [16].

Clones expressing recombinant proteins\nwere identified by immuno-dot blot or Western analysis\nof supernatants from small-scale cultures, using an anti-\n(His)6 antibody (Invitrogen) for ButaIT, and anti-GNA\nantibodies for ButaIT\/GNA.\nFor protein production, P. pastoris cells containing the\nButaIT, ButaIT\/GNA or GNA constructs were grown in\nshake flasks (30\u00b0C with shaking), or a BioFlo 110 labora-\ntory fermenter [21] as previously described [11], except\nthat the pH of the growing culture was maintained at 4.0.\nRecombinant protein samples were purified using hydro-\nphobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Sepha-\nrose (Amersham-Pharmacia) column, as previously\ndescribed [11]. Recombinant ButaIT, ButaIT\/GNA and\nGNA eluted at low salt concentration, or in water, and\nwere analysed for purity by SDS-PAGE. Lyophilised\nButaIT\/GNA and GNA were further purified using gel fil-\ntration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.6 cm diameter, 90\ncm length, 0.3 ml\/min), equilibrated in PBS buffer. Frac-\ntions containing purified ButaIT\/GNA or GNA were\npooled, analysed for purity and concentration (absorb-\nance 280 nm; SDS-PAGE), prior to use in injection and\ndiet bioassays. Purified proteins were de-salted by dialysis\nand freeze-dried, or de-salted and concentrated using\nMicrosep TM centrifugal concentrators (VivaScience AG,\nHannover, Germany).\nProteins were analysed routinely by SDS-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Samples were prepared\nby adding 4\u00d7 SDS sample buffer (containing 10% 2-mer-\ncaptoethanol) and boiled for 5\u201310 min prior to loading.\nFor separation of low molecular weight polypeptides,\nSDS-PAGE was carried out using a Tris-Tricine buffer sys-\ntem according to the protocol of Schagger and von Jagow\n[22]. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue, or\ntransferred to nitrocellulose using a Biorad Trans-blot SD\nsemi-dry transfer cell, according to the manufacturers rec-\nommendations.\nConcentrations of purified recombinant proteins were\nestimated by comparison with known amounts of stand-\nard GNA after SDS-PAGE, or Western blotting using anti-\nGNA antibodies (1:3300 dilution) as previously described\nin detail [23]. Haemagglutination assays were carried out\nas described previously [13].\nInsect Bioassays\nPartially purified ButaIT and purified ButaIT\/GNA and\nGNA were tested for biological activity by injecting 5\u201310\n\u00b5l of aqueous samples (freeze-dried protein re-suspended\nin water or PBS) into fifth stadium L. oleracea larvae of\napprox. 50\u201370 mg in weight. For each concentration\ntested 10\u201315 larvae were injected and toxic effects moni-\ntored over the next 7 days. PBS or water were injected as\nnegative controls; no difference was observed between\nthese two treatments, and survival over 2\u20133 days after the\ninjection was routinely >90%.\nA potato leaf-based artificial diet [24] was used in assays\nof the toxicity of recombinant ButaIT\/GNA on oral deliv-\nery to lepidopteran larvae. For each treatment 20 newly\nmoulted third stadium L. oleracea larvae were maintained\nin clear plastic pots containing moist filter paper to pre-\nvent diet desiccation. Survival was monitored daily. Total\nlarval weights (\u00b1 0.1 mg) per treatment were recorded\ndaily for the first 4 days of the assay and subsequently,\nindividual larval wet weights (\u00b1 0.1 mg) were recorded\ndaily, and diet consumption (per replicate) was estimated\non a wet weight basis. The amount of recombinant\nButaIT\/GNA and GNA added to diets was estimated as\ndescribed in section 2.4; control diets contained no added\nprotein.\nToxicity of proteins when fed to rice brown planthopper\nwas assayed using a liquid diet. An artificial diet (MMD-\n1), suitable for the short-term maintenance of N. lugens,\nwas prepared according to Mitsuhashi [25]. Assays were\nset up by placing five second instar N. lugens nymphs in\neach feeding chamber, consisting of the base of a 35 mm\npetri dish lined with moist filter paper. Two layers of Para-\nfilm M\u00ae were stretched over the top, with 100 \u00b5l of artifi-\ncial diet sandwiched between the two layers [26]. Feeding\nchambers were kept at 28\u00b0C, 90 % RH, 16 h:8 h light:dark\nregime, and the diet sachets were replaced every 2 days to\navoid contamination. A total of 10 replicates (50 insects)\nwere used per treatment, and survival was recorded daily\nover 8 days. The amounts of recombinant ButaIT\/GNA\nand GNA added to diets was estimated as described in sec-\ntion 2.4; diet containing no added protein was used as\nnegative control, and feeding chambers in which no diet\nwas available, but insects were kept moist (\"water only\")\nwere used as a positive control.\nAnalysis of haemolymph and gut tissue in L. oleracea \nlarvae exposed to recombinant proteins\nHaemolymph samples were extracted from L. oleracea lar-\nvae injected with recombinant proteins, or exposed to\nartificial diet containing ButaIT\/GNA or GNA, as previ-\nously described [10]. Protein concentrations were esti-\nmated by a microtitre-based Bradford assay (Biorad) using\nBSA as the standard protein. Aliquots of haemolymph\nBMC Biotechnology 2006, 6:18 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6750\/6\/18\nPage 12 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwere analysed for the presence of GNA immunoreactivity\nby Western blotting as described previously. Crude gut\nextracts were also prepared from larvae exposed to ButaIT\/\nGNA diets to verify binding of the fusion protein to the\ngut epithelium. Whole guts, dissected over ice, were\nflushed with PBS to remove contents. Following homoge-\nnisation, samples were centrifuged (12 000 \u00d7 rpm, 4\u00b0C\nfor 20 mins) and the supernatant assayed for protein con-\ncentration prior to analysis by Western blotting. Diet sam-\nples were also prepared (as described for gut samples) for\nanalysis by Western blotting to confirm that fusion pro-\ntein incorporated into artificial diet remained intact in 2\u2013\n3 day old diet.\nStatistical analyses\nAll data analysis was carried out using the Statview (v. 5.0;\nSAS Inc., Carey, NC, USA) software packages on Apple\nMacintosh computers. Unpaired t-tests, ANOVA analysis\n(Bonferroni-Dunn), Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests\nand survival analyses were carried out to determine any\nsignificant differences between treatments in the parame-\nters measured.\nAuthors' contributions\nNPT carried out the molecular biology, preliminary work\non protein production and insect bioassay, and insect bio-\nassays using rice brown planthopper; EF carried out bio-\nassays using tomato moth larvae, assisted in protein\nproduction, and drafted the manuscript; JAG conceived of\nthe study, designed the cloning strategy for ButIT and the\nexpression constructs, carried out protein purification,\nand analysed data.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Hillary Wilkinson for technical assistance, and Dr. David \nBown for assistance in protein purification.
