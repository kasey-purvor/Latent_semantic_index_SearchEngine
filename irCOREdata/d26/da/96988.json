We present a mathematical model of blood cell production which describes both the\ndevelopment of cells through the cell cycle, and the maturation of these cells as they differentiate to\nform the various mature blood cell types. The model differs from earlier similar ones by considering\nprimitive stem cells as a separate population from the differentiating cells, and this formulation\nremoves an apparent inconsistency in these earlier models. Three different controls are included\nin the model: proliferative control of stem cells, proliferative control of differentiating cells, and\nperipheral control of stem cell committal rate. It is shown that an increase in sensitivity of these\ncontrols can cause oscillations to occur through their interaction with time delays associated with\nproliferation and differentiation, respectively. We show that the characters of these oscillations are\nquite distinct and suggest that the model may explain an apparent superposition of fast and slow\noscillations which can occur in cyclical neutropenia.\nKey words. maturation, mathematical model, blood cell production, chronic myelogenous\nleukemia, delay equation, cyclical neutropenia\nAMS subject classifications. 00A69, 00A71\nDOI. 10.1137\/050648055\n1. Introduction. A number of hematological diseases are characterized by os-\ncillations in the circulating density of various types of blood cells. These include\nchronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), cyclical neutropenia (CN), polycythemia vera\n(PV) and aplastic anemia (AA). Examples of blood cell counts for CML and CN are\nshown in Figures 1 and 2.\nA review of the clinical data and a discussion of possible mechanisms for the\noscillations are given by Haurie, Dale, and Mackey [10]. These mechanisms focus on\nthe role of negative feedback control on proliferation and differentiation of blood cells\nwithin the bone marrow, together with time delays due to cell cycling and maturation.\nThere are consequently a number of different ways in which oscillations can occur,\nand one object of mathematical modelling of blood cell development is to understand\nwhich of these effects may be responsible for these oscillations.\nBlood cells are produced through a process of differentiation from primitive stem\ncells in the bone marrow. These pluripotential stem cells begin to develop along one of\nseveral different cell lineages, forming blast cells which eventually develop through a\nnumber of different stages to form the various kinds of blood cells. The most numerous\nare the red blood cells, or erythrocytes, whose normal density in the blood is about\n5 \u00d7 106 cells \u03bcl\u22121. Their primary function is in transporting oxygen to the tissues.\nPlatelets are formed by the fragmentation of megakaryocytes, which develop in the\nbone marrow. Platelets are present at levels of 5\u00d7105 cells \u03bcl\u22121, and their function is\nin blood clotting. Finally, there are a number of different white blood cells, the most\n\u2217Received by the editors December 20, 2005; accepted for publication (in revised form) May 17,\n2006; published electronically October 4, 2006.

The normal levels of these cells\nare controlled by a number of mechanisms, and an excess or deficit of the various cell\ntypes defines certain kinds of disease; for example, anemia refers to a low red blood\ncell count, below 4\u00d7 106 cells \u03bcl\u22121.\nThere are a number of features in Figures 1 and 2 which are of note. In CML,\nthere are regular oscillations in white blood cell counts with a long period ranging\nfrom 40 to 80 days (see Fortin and Mackey [7]). The other cell lines (platelets and\nreticulocytes, i.e., erythrocyte precursors) also oscillate in a similar fashion (Figure 1\ndoes not show this well; see Fortin and Mackey [7] for other examples).\nA similar observation is true of cyclical neutropenia. Oscillation periods are\non the order of 20 days, during which there is a marked collapse of the neutrophil\ncount to vanishingly low levels (see Dale and Hammond [4] and Guerry et al. [9]).\nOther cell types oscillate, but only the neutrophils appear to oscillate fairly regularly:\nOscillations in other cell types (e.g., red blood cells, platelets, reticulocytes, and\nlymphocytes) are marked by irregularity and high frequency noise (see Guerry et\nal. [9]). This latter feature is well illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to throw some light on these observations\nby the study of a model of blood cell proliferation and differentiation. This model\nis similar to those of previous authors, particularly that of Mackey and Rudnicki\n[13], and describes the stem cell and developing (blast) cell populations as functions\nof time, age (time through the proliferative cell cycle), and maturation (stage in\nthe differentiation process). Fokas, Keller, and Clarkson [6] describe a model with\ndiscrete generations in the development of blast cells, while Mackey and Rudnicki\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2029\n50\n50\n50\ndays\n5\n0\n6\n4\n2\n5\n0\nneu\nplt\nret\n100\n100\n100\nFig. 2.

Three separate controls are implemented\nin the model, namely the proliferative control of stem cells, the proliferative control of\ndeveloping blast cells, and the peripheral control of stem cell committal by circulating\nblood cell density. We show that variation of parameters in all three control systems\ncan cause oscillations, and that the characters of these oscillations are very different.\nThis allows us some potential insight into the mechanisms that may be operative in\nsome of these dynamic blood diseases.\n2. A model of maturation of blood cell production. We consider all cell\nlineages to consist of populations of two types, proliferative and resting phase (cf. Fig-\nure 3). These are denoted p and n, respectively, and are functions of age a (time since\nthe inception of the proliferative cell cycle) and maturation m (degree of maturation,\nmeasured in maturation units (mat), which could be, for example, cell generation\nnumber). Also, p and n are functions of time t. Thus, we have p = p(t,m, a) and\nn = n(t,m, a). The dimensions of p and n are cells age\u22121 mat\u22121.\nIn the cell population, there will be a finite number which are primitive and have\nnot begun differentiation. These cannot be characterized in terms of p and n atm = 0,\nsince the latter are cell densities with respect to a and m. The primitive stem cells\nare characterized by cell densities p0(t, a) and n0(t, a), such that p0 da and n0 da are\nthe numbers of primitive stem cells (with m = 0) of age in (a, a+ da).\n2030 I.

Schematic evolution of cells. Each cell ages as it goes through its cell cycle, before\ndividing and entering a resting (G0) phase; at the same time, the cells mature. The time-like\nvariables a (age) and m (maturation) are independent.\nThe basic model is similar to that described by Mackey and Rudnicki [13]. It has\nbeen analyzed in various versions by Rey and Mackey [16], Crabb, Mackey, and Rey\n[3], and Mackey and Rudnicki [14]. However, a particular feature of these previous\nmodels was the assumption of zero maturation rate at maturation state zero. This\nleads to some odd behavior, which we believe arises because the model does not\nproperly identify the role played by primitive stem cells. In our formulation of the\nmodel, we do not make this assumption.\nSpecifically, Mackey and Rudnicki [13], [14] assumed a model in which the cell\ndensity depended on stage of maturation m, age through the cell cycle a, and time\nt. As a consequence, the number of cells of zero age in the cell cycle is zero, as is\nthe number of cells of zero maturation. As is common in age-structured population\nmodels, the migration of cells away from age zero through the cell cycle is balanced\nby a renewal equation, which here takes the form of recruitment from the resting cell\npopulation. However, there is in general no recruitment to the stem cell population at\nzero maturation, and as a consequence, the Mackey\u2013Rudnicki model generally leads\nto a disappearance of the cells as they migrate down the maturation stage without\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2031\nreplenishment. In their model, they were able to avoid this unattractive option by\nallowing a rate of maturation V (m) which tended to zero as m \u2192 0. The effect of\nthis assumption is to make the time of maturation infinite, and in addition it causes\nstrange irregular behavior to occur (see Dyson, Villella-Bresson, and Webb [5]). We\nconsider that an implication of the lack of recruitment of stem cells is that they\nmust be represented in the model as a compartment of finite number and therefore\ncannot be represented in terms of a density dependent on both m and a. In fact,\nconsistent with previous models of stem cells (see Mackey [11], [12]), we suppose that\nthe stem cell population can be represented as a density dependent on a and t only.\nThis assumption removes the Mackey\u2013Rudnicki awkwardness and does not require an\nartificial and unnatural choice (with its artificial consequences) of maturation rate.\nThe evolution of the system is illustrated schematically in Figure 3. We suppose\nthat cell mortality occurs at a rate \u03b3 (for proliferating cells only), and that cell\nmaturation occurs continuously at a rate V (for both proliferative and resting phases).\nWe suppose that both \u03b3 and V may depend on maturation stage m, but not on t.\nConservation of proliferative cells then implies\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202p\n\u2202a\n+\n\u2202(V p)\n\u2202m\n= \u2212\u03b3p,(2.1)\nwhere the units of V are mat d\u22121 (maturation units per day). We suppose (2.1)\napplies during a cycle of length \u03c4 (which might depend on m), thus for 0 < a < \u03c4 .\nFor a > \u03c4 , the cells in the resting phase satisfy the equation\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202n\n\u2202a\n+\n\u2202(V n)\n\u2202m\n= \u2212Rn,(2.2)\nwhich differs from (2.1) by the rate of recruitment R back to the proliferative phase,\nwhere resting cell mortality is taken to be zero. Equation (2.2) applies for a > \u03c4 .\nAt the end of the cell cycle, a = \u03c4 , we apply a boundary condition describing the\nconversion of p to n. Mackey and Rudnicki [13] allow a very general condition, on the\nbasis that cells at maturation M can divide to form cells at maturation g(M) \u2264 M .\nSpecifically, this implies 2p[t,M, \u03c4(M)] dM = n[t, g(M), \u03c4{g(M)}] dg. If we write\nm = g(M), M = h(m) (thus h = g\u22121), then this becomes\nn[t,m, \u03c4(m)] = 2p[t, h(m), \u03c4{h(m)}]h\u2032(m),(2.3)\nwhere g(m) \u2264 m implies h(m) \u2265 m.\nA boundary condition for p at a = 0 follows from the recruitment condition (the\nrenewal equation)\np(t,m, 0) = RN(t,m),(2.4)\nwhere we introduce the total resting cell density\nN =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\nnda.(2.5)\nNow we integrate (2.2) from a = \u03c4 to a = \u221e, taking n \u2192 0 as a \u2192 \u221e (which\nis necessary if there is a finite number of cells). We suppose that V = V (m) is\nindependent of a and t, and that R = R(t,m) is independent of a. Then\n\u2202N\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202(V N)\n\u2202m\n= \u2212RN + 2p[t, h(m), \u03c4{h(m)}]h\u2032(m),(2.6)\n2032 I. DROBNJAK, A. C. FOWLER, AND M. C. MACKEY\nadopting (2.3).\nWe need to solve (2.1) for p. We use the method of characteristics and begin\nby applying the recruitment condition (2.4). Specifically, we apply the parametric\nconditions\nt = s, m = \u03bc, a = 0, p = R(s, \u03bc)N(s, \u03bc),(2.7)\nvalid for s, \u03bc > 0; then the characteristic solution is\na = t\u2212 s,\n\u222b m\n\u03bc\nd\u03c1\nV (\u03c1)\n= t\u2212 s,\np = R(s, \u03bc)N(s, \u03bc) exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\ns\n[\u03b3 + V \u2032(m)] dt\n]\n.(2.8)\nDefine a function \u03bd(m, a) by \u222b m\n\u03bd\nd\u03c1\nV (\u03c1)\n= a.(2.9)\nThen a = t\u2212 s, \u03bc = \u03bd(m, a). Also dt = dm\/V (m) on a characteristic; thus for t > a\n(and also \u03bd > 0),\np(t,m, a) = R[t\u2212 a, \u03bd(m, a)]N [t\u2212 a, \u03bd(m, a)] exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b m\n\u03bd(m,a)\n{\u03b3 + V \u2032(\u03c1)} d\u03c1\nV (\u03c1)\n]\n.\n(2.10)\nSimplifying and putting a = \u03c4 , we have\np(t,m, \u03c4) = R[t\u2212 \u03c4, \u03bd(m, \u03c4)]N [t\u2212 \u03c4, \u03bd(m, \u03c4)] exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b m\n\u03bd(m,\u03c4)\n\u03b3 d\u03c1\nV (\u03c1)\n]\nV [\u03bd(m, \u03c4)]\nV (m)\n(2.11)\nfor t > \u03c4 and \u03bd > 0.

The lower limit can be chosen for convenience and allows\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2033\nus to fix \u03be at some reference point; here we choose this to be the initial maturation\nstage (note that this cannot be done if V (0) = 0).

Note also that p0 and n0\nhave units of cells age\u22121 (unlike p and n).\nThe primitive loss to maturation must balance the source for p and n at m = 0;\nthus\nV0p0 = (V p)|m=0, V0n0 = (V n)|m=0,(2.24)\nand the units are consistent.\nAnalogously to (2.4) and (2.3), we have\np0(t, 0) = R0(t)N0(t),\nn0(t, \u03c4) = 2p0(t, \u03c4),(2.25)\nwhere\nN0 =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\nn0 da.(2.26)\nIntegration over a now yields\ndN0\ndt\n= \u2212V0N0 \u2212R0N0 + 2p0|a=\u03c4 ,(2.27)\nand\n(NV )|m=0 = N0V0.(2.28)\nIn order to find p0 we must solve\n\u2202p0\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202p0\n\u2202a\n= \u2212(\u03b30 + V0)p0(2.29)\nwith parametric initial conditions\np0 = p00(\u03b1), a = \u03b1 > 0, t = 0,\np0 = R0(s)N0(s), a = 0, t = s > 0.(2.30)\nFor t > a, the solution is\np0 = R0(t\u2212 a)N0(t\u2212 a) exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\nt\u2212a\n[\u03b30(t\n\u2032) + V0(t\u2032)] dt\u2032\n]\n,(2.31)\nwhereas for t < a,\np0 = p00(a\u2212 t) exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\n[\u03b30(t\n\u2032) + V0(t\u2032)] dt\u2032\n]\n.(2.32)\nPutting a = \u03c4 , we find\ndN0\ndt\n= \u2212(R0 + V0)N0 + 2R0(t\u2212 \u03c4)N0(t\u2212 \u03c4) exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\n[\u03b30(t\n\u2032) + V0(t\u2032)] dt\u2032\n]\n, t > \u03c4,\n(2.33)\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2035\nwhich prescribes the control system for N0, analogously to that of Mackey [11]. For\nt < \u03c4 , the equation for N0 involves the initial condition for p0, and we can equivalently\nsimply prescribe initial data for N0 there.\nFinally, we complete the definition of Q in (2.19) by solving (2.1) using the initial\ndata on m = 0:\nm = 0, a = \u03b1 > 0, t = s > 0, V (0)p = V0(s)p0(s, \u03b1).(2.34)\nWe find\np(t, \u03be, a) =\nV0(t\u2212 \u03be)p0(t\u2212 \u03be, a\u2212 \u03be)\nv(\u03be)\nexp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\n0\n\u03b3 d\u03be\n]\n, \u03be < a, \u03be < t,(2.35)\nfrom which it follows that\nQ = 2\u03b7\u2032(\u03be)V0(t\u2212 \u03b7)p0[t\u2212 \u03b7, \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b7] exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n0\n\u03b3 d\u03be\n]\n, t > \u03b7, \u03b7 < \u03c4.(2.36)\nAlong with (2.20) and (2.22), this completes the definition of Q for t > 0, \u03b7 > 0 (and\nthus \u03be > 0).

Only by choosing V (0) = 0\ncan we allow primitive stem cells to endure. In the present version of the model, it is\nalso possible to allow V (0) = 0; for example, (2.39) would then imply\nM \u2192 0 as \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u221e.(2.40)\nThe sensitivity of the solution to this condition has led to the idea that the system\nmay have unstable and even chaotic solutions (e.g., Crabb, Mackey, and Rey [3]),\nbecause of the degeneracy of the equation at m = 0. Our considerations here suggest\nthat the requirement that V (0) = 0 is inaccurate, because it does not properly address\nthe biological question of how the primitive stem cells should be described.\n2036 I. DROBNJAK, A. C. FOWLER, AND M. C. MACKEY\n3. Dimensionless model. How we solve the model depends on the complexity\nof our assumptions about \u03b3, R, \u03b7, and R0. In the remainder of this paper we will\nassume g(m) = m (thus \u03b7 = \u03be) and that \u03b3 and \u03b30 are constant. The equation for the\nmaturing cells, (2.19), is\n\u2202M\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202M\n\u2202\u03be\n= \u2212RM +Q,(3.1)\nand is a hyperbolic delay partial differential equation. Figure 4 shows the regions\nwhere the different definitions of Q apply. In regions II and segment (a) of region III,\nthat is, for t < \u03c4 and all \u03b7 = \u03be > 0, Q depends on the initial data, either pI (in II)\nor p00 (in III(a)). Thus we may equivalently simply choose instead to prescribe M in\n0 < t < \u03c4 , and this we do. In fact, since \u03be is finite, the part of the solution which\ndepends on this initial data will wash out of the system in a finite time. It is therefore\napparently of little concern.\nWe therefore confine ourselves to consideration of the definition of Q in regions I\nand III(b); with the assumptions we have made, we find that for t > \u03c4 ,\nQ =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n2e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4R[t\u2212 \u03c4, \u03be \u2212 \u03c4 ]M [t\u2212 \u03c4, \u03be \u2212 \u03c4 ], \u03be > \u03c4,\n2e\u2212\u03b30(\u03c4\u2212\u03be)e\u2212\u03b3\u03be exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\u2212\u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\nV0(t\n\u2032) dt\u2032\n]\nV0(t\u2212 \u03be)R0(t\u2212 \u03c4)N0(t\u2212 \u03c4), \u03be < \u03c4.\n(3.2)\nWe thus have to solve (3.1) with (3.2) in t > \u03c4 , with the boundary condition (2.38)\non \u03be = 0, and prescription of an initial function for M in 0 < t < \u03c4 .\nA principal issue of focus is how the recruitment rates R and R0 and the committal\nrate V0 depend on M , N0, and \u03be. There is very little to constrain our choice. In what\nfollows, we assume R0 = R0(N0) (stem cell proliferation is controlled by stem cell\ndensity). We follow Mackey and Rudnicki [13] in supposing that R depends on the\ntotal differentiating cell population M\u00af , where\nM\u00af(t) =\n\u222b \u03beF\n0\nM d\u03be,(3.3)\nwith \u03beF being the time of final maturation,\n\u03beF =\n\u222b mF\n0\nd\u03c1\nV (\u03c1)\n,(3.4)\nand m = mF at full maturity. We suppose that the rate of committal V0 should\ndepend on the peripheral blood cell count, B, and thus V0 = V0(B). A simple model\nfor B is\ndB\ndt\n= M |\u03beF \u2212 \u03b3BB,(3.5)\nwhere \u03b3B is the specific decay rate of the peripheral blood cells, and the source term\nM |\u03beF is the delivery rate to the blood from the maturation phase cells. Peripheral\ncontrol models of similar type have been studied by Bernard, Be\u00b4lair, and Mackey [1].\nAssumptions of this type are liable to be important in the evolution of diseases such\nas cyclical neutropenia, which is thought to be due to an instability in the peripheral\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2037\nt\nIII\nt = \u03c4\n\u03b7 = \u03c4\nII\nba\nI\n\u03b7 (= \u03be)\nFig. 4.

This is precisely the model of Mackey [11] if V0 is constant,\nand it has been studied by Fowler and Mackey [8] in the limit\nV0\u03c4 \b 1,(3.7)\nwhen it is shown that relaxation oscillations will occur for a further parameter \u03bc0 =\n[2e\u2212(\u03b30+V0)\u03c4 \u2212 1]\/V0\u03c4 within a certain O(1) range. (Note that in the notation of\nFowler and Mackey\u2019s model, \u03b3 = \u03b30+V0, \u03b4 = V0.) When such oscillations occur, they\nwill propagate through the maturing cells; however, we show in this paper that the\nresultant amplitude of oscillations of mature blood cells is small unless amplification\nalso occurs during maturation.\nWe can write (3.2) in abbreviated form as\nQ =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n2e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4R(M\u00af\u03c4 )M\u03c4,\u03c4 , \u03be > \u03c4,\n2e\u2212\u03b30(\u03c4\u2212\u03be)e\u2212\u03b3\u03be exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222b t\u2212\u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\nV0[B(t\n\u2032)] dt\u2032\n]\nV0[B(t\u2212 \u03be)]R0(N0\u03c4 )N0\u03c4 , \u03be < \u03c4,\n(3.8)\n2038 I.

Equation (3.12) is exactly that studied by Fowler and Mackey\n[8] (if v0 \u2261 1). However, their model can also be interpreted as a lumped, or com-\npartmentalized, version of (3.14) for the maturing cells. One way of enabling this is\nif we make the special assumption that the maturation rate V \u2192 0 as both m \u2192 0\nand m \u2192 mF , as also assumed by Mackey and Rudnicki [13]. In this case the range\nof \u03be is (\u2212\u221e,\u221e), and we have M \u2192 0 at both limits. Then integration of (3.14) over\n\u03be again leads to an equation of the form of (3.12). In the present paper we assume\nV is finite at m = mF , i.e., the mature blood cells are delivered to the bloodstream\nat a finite rate, and this is then the essential difference between the models with and\nwithout maturation.\nIn estimating the parameters, we follow Fowler and Mackey [8] in choosing \u03c4 \u223c 2\nd, and we suppose that proliferative control is effected at typical rates R\u2217 \u223c R\u22170 \u223c 2\nd\u22121. We suppose that apoptosis rates are of order \u03b3 \u223c \u03b30 \u223c 0.2 d\u22121 and that\ncommittal rates are of order V \u22170 \u223c 0.05 d\u22121, and from these we find\nb \u223c b0 \u223c 4, \u03bb \u223c \u03bb0 \u223c 0.3, \u03b50 \u223c 0.1.(3.21)\nThe parameter \u03b1 is not independent of the others, as\n\u03b1 = \u03b50 + ln\n(\n1 + \u03bb0\n1 + \u03bb\n)\n,(3.22)\nand plausibly \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b50.\nThe remaining parameters are \u03b4, \u03bd, and \u03bef . For \u03b4, we assume a half-life (\u03b3\n\u22121\nB ) of 7\nhours, appropriate for neutrophils (but, for example, certainly not for erythrocytes);\nthen\n\u03b4 \u223c 0.15.(3.23)\nWe can get some sense of the size of the remaining parameters \u03bd and \u03bef by\nconsidering the nature of stem cells. These are difficult to isolate; indeed it is not\nyet clear whether genuine stem cells have ever really been isolated. The reason for\nthis is that there are few of them, and maturing cells will typically undergo about\n(or at least) 20 divisions before emerging as mature blood cells. A typical numerical\nestimate for the total number of blast cells is 1012 per kg body weight, while for stem\ncells, a corresponding estimate is 106 (see Bernard, Be\u00b4lair, and Mackey [1], Mackey\n[12]). If this is the case, then it successively implies that the parameter \u03bd in (3.16)\nis very small (\u2248 10\u22126), and therefore also that the maturation time is long. Typical\nestimates of \u03beF \u2248 10\u201320 days are consistent with values of \u03bef \u2248 5\u201310, and in fact the\nsmall parameter \u03be\u22121f then plays the role corresponding to that of the small parameter\n\u03b5 in Fowler and Mackey\u2019s [8] analysis.\n2040 I.

The steady solution of (3.14) and (3.15) is, with v0 = S = 1,\nM = \u03bdes\u03be,(3.24)\nwhere s is the unique positive solution of the pair\ns = bh(M\u00af)\n[\n(1 + \u03bb)e\u2212s \u2212 1] ,\nM\u00af =\n\u03bd\ns\n(\nes\u03bef \u2212 1) .(3.25)\n(Uniqueness follows from the fact that M\u00af is monotonically increasing with s, hence\nh(M\u00af) is monotonically decreasing with s, and hence bh(M\u00af) [(1 + \u03bb)e\u2212s \u2212 1] is mono-\ntonically decreasing with s, while evidently s is increasing.) We can see that s <\nln(1 + \u03bb), and s will be close to this value if b is large. Note also that by choosing \u03bb0\nand \u03b50 to have certain specific values which depend on \u03bb, b, \u03bd, and \u03bef , this solution\nconsistently extends back to \u03be = 0, even allowing for the distinct definition of Q in\n\u03be < 1.\nNumerical solutions do confirm the exponential variation of M with \u03be. In general,\nit is found that M decreases for 0 < \u03be < 1, before subsequently increasing.\n4. Periodic solutions. We are interested in finding whether periodic solutions\ncan occur. There are three different controllers in the model, and thus three different\nways in which oscillations can occur: These are described below. We utilize a reference\nset of parameters based on the estimates in Fowler and Mackey [8], and these are given\nin Table 1. They are those suggested by independent estimate, except that we take\n\u03bd = 10\u22122 rather than 10\u22126. This is partly for numerical expediency, as smaller values\nof \u03bd require larger \u03bef and thus longer computation times, and also because the value\nof \u03bd is not well constrained.\nTable 1\nThe reference parameter values, based on estimates in Fowler and Mackey [8].\nSymbol Typical value\nn 3\n\u03b50 0.1\n\u03bb0 0.3\nb0 4\n\u03bd 10\u22122\nb 4\n\u03bb 0.3\n\u03bef 5\n\u03b4 0.2\nv\u2217 1\nv\u2032 1\nWe choose the Hill function controller (3.11) for both h and h0; thus\nh(M\u00af) =\n1\n1 + M\u00afn\n, h0(S) =\n1\n1 + Sn\n,(4.1)\nand we take the peripheral controller v0 to have the form\nv0 = [v\n\u2217 \u2212 v\u2032B]+,(4.2)\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2041\nwith default values of the amplitude and slope parameters to be v\u2217 = v\u2032 = 1. The\nchoice of a threshold in (4.2) is motivated by the observation that neutrophil popula-\ntions can dwindle to zero in cyclical neutropenia, which would appear to require zero\nproduction for sufficiently high blood cell counts.\nWith this choice of the controller functions and using the default parameters, the\nsteady state is stable. Instabilities arising from parameter variations are described\nbelow.\nNumerical method. We have to solve the two ordinary differential equations\n(3.12) and (3.19), and the partial differential equation (3.14). The solution is compli-\ncated by the presence of the integral in (3.12). We define\nU = S exp\n[\n\u03b50\n\u222b t\nv0[B(t\n\u2032)] dt\u2032\n]\n,(4.3)\nand then S and U satisfy the pair of equations\nS\u02d9 = S\n[\nU\u02d9\nU\n\u2212 \u03b50v0\n]\n,\nU\u02d9 = b0 [(1 + \u03bb)e\n\u03b1h0(S1)U1 \u2212 h0(S)U ] .(4.4)\nOn the assumption that S remains bounded, U grows exponentially as U \u223c exp(v0t),\nwhere v0 is the mean of v0. This is likely to cause difficulty in numerical solutions, and\nthis can be reduced by using the algebraically growing function W = lnU , whence\nS\u02d9 = S\n[\nW\u02d9 \u2212 \u03b50v0\n]\n,\nW\u02d9 = b0\n[\n(1 + \u03bb)h0(S1)e\n\u03b1+W1\u2212W \u2212 h0(S)\n]\n.(4.5)\nIn our numerical solutions, we solve (4.5) using the second order accurate improved\nEuler method, and we similarly solve (3.14) along the characteristics \u03be \u2212 t = \u03b7, on\nwhich the function Q takes the form\nQ =\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\nb(1 + \u03bb)h(M\u00af1)M1 , \u03be > 1,\nb0(1 + \u03bb)e\n\u03b1(1\u2212\u03be)M0(\u03b7)h0(S1) exp [W1 \u2212W (\u03b7)] , \u03be < 1,\n(4.6)\nwhere M0(\u03b7) = M(\u03b7, 0) and M1 = M1,1, i.e., M delayed by one along the character-\nistic.\nAccurate solutions are obtained with a time step \u0394t = \u0394\u03be = 0.05, and these are\nchecked against values \u0394t = \u0394\u03be = 0.02 (which are used to give the figures).\nStem cell oscillations. Oscillations in the primitive stem cell population will\noccur for a finite range of the parameter \u03bb0\/\u03b50, as described by Fowler and Mackey\n[8], when v0 = 1. For the default values of b0 = 4, n = 3, the approximate range\nof instability is 0.5\u03b50 <\u223c \u03bb0 <\u223c 1.5\u03b50, and this is modified in an obvious way when the\nperipheral controller alters the value of v0. Figure 5 shows the oscillations which\noccur in the stem cell population when \u03bb0 is reduced to 0.05. It is an interesting\nfact that these oscillations are hardly manifested in the blood cell population. The\napparent reason for this is that the small value of \u03bd means that oscillations in M0, and\ntherefore also in Mf , are small because small perturbations propagate stably down\nthe maturation axis. The blood cell population is therefore stable, and B \u2248Mf .\n2042 I. DROBNJAK, A. C. FOWLER, AND M. C. MACKEY\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n400 410 420 430 440 450\nS\nB\nS,B\nt\nFig. 5.

We use the term proliferation-controlled\noscillations to refer to oscillations induced by destabilization of the proliferative feed-\nback control function h(M\u00af). If we compare the stem cell model (3.12) (with v0 = 1)\nS\u02d9 = b0 [(1 + \u03bb0)h0(S1)S1 \u2212 h0(S)S]\u2212 \u03b50S(4.7)\nwith the blast cell model (along the characteristics)\nM\u02d9 = b\n[\n(1 + \u03bb)h(M\u00af1)M1,1 \u2212 h(M\u00af)M\n]\n,(4.8)\nit is not difficult to sense that modification of the parameters b or \u03bb may cause the\nblast maturation to proceed unstably.\nThis is what we find if \u03bb is increased to 0.6, and the consequent oscillations are\nshown in Figure 6. The steady exponential proliferation of blast cells is unstable,\nwhich causes oscillations to occur in the maturation profile, and these oscillations\npropagate along the characteristics, as shown in Figure 7.\nThe oscillations have period equal to the cell cycling time, equal to one in our\nscaled model. A partial understanding of these oscillations is afforded by the obser-\nvation that if h is constant and M is periodic with period 2\u03c0\/\u03c9, then (4.8) admits a\nsolution\nM =\n\u2211\np,q\ncpqe\n\u03c3q\u03be+ip\u03c9(t\u2212\u03be),(4.9)\nprovided that \u03c3q satisfies\n\u03c3 = \u2212A\u2212Ge\u2212\u03c3,(4.10)\nwhere\nA = bh, G = \u2212bh(1 + \u03bb).(4.11)\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2043\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n400 402 404 406 408 410\nB\nM_f\nS\nB, Mf\nt\n, S\nFig. 6.

Two snapshots of the maturation profile for the numerical solution in Figure 6. An\nexponentially growing travelling wave propagates down the maturation axis.\nSince \u03bb > 0, we have G + A < 0, and it is straightforward to show that there is\nalways a single positive root, which can be labelled with q = 0. The others are\ncomplex (conjugates), and are labelled with increasing frequency as q = \u00b11,\u00b12, etc.\nConsideration of these complex roots then shows that for small |G|, Re\u03c3q < 0, so that\nthe effect of the oscillations dies away as the cells mature; this is what happens in\nFigure 5. However, for larger |G|, Re\u03c3q > 0, and the oscillations grow in amplitude as\nthe cells mature. This causes M\u00af to fluctuate, and thus also h, presumably entraining\nthe period of the oscillations to that of the delay. This description is consistent with\n2044 I. DROBNJAK, A. C.

The final kind of oscillation that we\nsee is induced by the peripheral control of stem cell committal through the function\nv0(B). These are essentially delay induced oscillations, where now the delay involved\nis the maturation time. Because we suppose maturation time is large, these are long\nperiod oscillations. They can be caused by increasing the sensitivity of the peripheral\ncontroller, as shown in Figure 9.\nTo understand the origin of these oscillations, let us suppose that \u03bef \u000b 1, or\n\u03beF \u000b \u03c4 , meaning that the maturation time is significantly longer than the cell cycle\ntime, or equivalently, that there are a large number of generations in the cell lineage.\nLet us define\n\u03b5 =\n1\n\u03bem\n,(4.13)\nand the slow time and maturation scales\nT = \u03b5t, X = \u03b5\u03be.(4.14)\nWe also define \u03bc via\n\u03bb = \u03b5\u03bc,(4.15)\nand suppose that \u03bc = O(1). Essentially we are revisiting the relaxation oscillation\nanalysis of Fowler and Mackey [8].

DROBNJAK, A. C. FOWLER, AND M. C. MACKEY\nThis is a standard delay recruitment equation with a unique steady state. Oscillations\nwill occur as a consequence of instability if there are solutions \u03c3 of (4.10), i.e.,\n\u03c3 = \u2212A\u2212Ge\u2212\u03c3,(4.23)\nwith positive real part. The values of A and G are\nA =\n1\n\u03b5\u03b4\n, G =\n\u03bda|v\u20320|\n\u03b5\u03b4\n.(4.24)\nEquation (4.23) is well understood; see, for example, Mackey [11] or Murray\n[15, pp. 23\u201326]. It is a transcendental equation with an infinite number of complex\nroots which accumulate at the essential singularity at \u03c3 = \u2212\u221e. It follows that the\nset of Re\u03c3 is bounded above. Consequently, there is an instability criterion which\ndetermines when all the roots \u03c3 have negative real part, and this is indicated in Figure\n10. The three curves in the figure are given by G = \u2212A, G = exp[\u2212(1 +A)], and the\nHopf bifurcation curve G = G0(A), which is given parametrically by\nA = \u2212 \u03a9\ntan\u03a9\n, G0 =\n\u03a9\nsin\u03a9\n,(4.25)\nwhere \u03a9 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. Since G and A are positive, oscillatory instability occurs precisely\nif G > G0(A). Since G0 \u223c A as A\u2192\u221e, the instability criterion for large A is simply\nG >\u223c A, i.e.,\n\u03bd|v\u20320| exp\n[\n\u03bcbh\n1 + bh\n]\n> 1.(4.26)\nInstability is promoted by increasing |v\u20320|, for example, as indicated in Figure 9.\n5. Conclusions. In this paper we have studied the onset of oscillations in a\nmodel of blood cell production which includes a description of cell cycling and prolif-\neration, and also of differentiation and maturation. The model formulation extends\nthe work of previous authors by correcting an apparent inconsistency in the descrip-\ntion of the primitive stem cell population, and also by including the simultaneous\ncontrol of stem cell proliferation, stem cell committal, and blast cell proliferation. All\nthree controls can cause oscillations for appropriate values of control parameters.\nPrevious results concerning stem cell oscillations are reproduced (see Figure 5),\nbut these oscillations are harder to obtain when the parameter \u03bd is small, and in ad-\ndition they hardly affect the mature blood cell population without additional desta-\nbilization of the blast cell proliferation. The reason for this is that an O(1) oscillation\nin the stem cell population causes only an O(\u03bd) oscillation in the blast cell committal\nrate, and this amplitude propagates through the differentiating cells. Thus one con-\nsequence of stem cell paucity is that any instability in the stem cell population itself\nis hardly manifested in the blood cell production. From the point of view of survival\nand control, this is, of course, a positive result.\nInstability in the proliferation of blast cells due to enhancement of the proliferative\ncontroller h(M\u00af) causes oscillations which propagate down the maturation axis and\nare amplified as they progress. The result of this is shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8.\nThe oscillations have a period equal to the cell cycling time. The mechanism for these\noscillations appears to be a destabilization of the maturing cell amplification, together\nwith a type of resonance which ties the period to the delay.\nOSCILLATIONS IN BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION 2047\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n+,-\n+ +\n-\n-,-\n+,+ osc, U\nosc, S\n0\nG\nA\nG (A)\nG = -A\nFig. 10.

Default parameters are\nused, except that v\u2217 = v\u2032 = 2, \u03bb0 = 0.05, and \u03bb = 0.6.\nThe final kind of oscillation is induced by enhanced peripheral control, as seen in\nFigure 9. Stem cell paucity implies that \u03bd \b 1 and, consequently, that \u03bef \u000b 1, and\nthus that the oscillation period (controlled by the delay \u03bef ) is long. This allows an\napproximate reduction of the partial differential delay equation to a simple first order\ndifferential delay equation, which is simply analyzed. In particular, if a threshold\nform of peripheral controller is used, blood cell counts can decrease to zero, as can be\nthe case in cyclical neutropenia.\nFinally, and as shown in Figure 11, a combination of all three destabilizing mech-\n2048 I.

We consider this observation\nto be a possible explanation of the apparent fact in Figure 2 that both reticulocytes\nand platelets appear to oscillate on a fast as well as a slow time scale. Further study\nof this behavior requires the extension of this model to accommodate multiple cell\nlineages.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Bernard, J. Be\u00b4lair, and M. C.
