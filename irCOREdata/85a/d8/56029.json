Conditions \nreached granulite facies (ca. 780\u00baC and ca. 780 MPa). Comparing geochronological \nand petrological characteristics with other outcrops of Mesoproterozoic basement, \nparticularly in the northern and central Arequipa\u2013Antofalla craton, we suggest that \nthese regions were part of a single continental crustal block from Mesoproterozoic \ntimes, and thus autochthonous or parautochthonous to Gondwana.  \n \n 2\nKey words: Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina, metamorphism, U-Pb SHRIMP zircon dating, \nGrenville. \n \nIntroduction \n The Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina, the largest outcrop of pre-Andean \ncrystalline basement in southern South America, resulted from plate interactions \nalong the proto-Andean margin of Gondwana, from as early as Mesoproterozoic to \nLate Paleozoic times (e.g., Ramos, 2004, and references therein). Two discrete \nPaleozoic orogenic belts have been recognized: the Early Cambrian Pampean belt in \nthe eastern sierras, and the Ordovician Famatinian belt, which partially overprints it to \nthe west (e.g., Rapela et al., 1998). In the Western Sierras Pampeanas, \nMesoproterozoic igneous rocks (ca. 1.0\u20131.2 Ga) have been recognized in the Sierra de \nPie de Palo (Fig. 1) (McDonough et al., 1993; Pankhurst and Rapela, 1998; Vujovich \net al., 2004) that are time-coincident with the Grenvillian orogeny of eastern and \nnortheastern North America (e.g., Rivers, 1997; Corriveau and van Breemen, 2000).  \nThese Grenvillian-age rocks have been considered to be the easternmost exposure of \nbasement to the Precordillera Terrane, a supposed Laurentian continental block \naccreted to Gondwana during the Famatinian orogeny (Thomas and Astini, 2003, and \nreferences therein). However, the boundaries of this Grenvillian belt are still poorly \ndefined, and its alleged allochthoneity has been challenged (Galindo et al., 2004). \nMoreover, most of the Grenvillian ages so far determined relate to igneous protoliths, \nand there is no conclusive evidence for a Grenvillian orogenic belt, other than inferred \nfrom petrographic evidence alone (Casquet et al., 2001). We provide here the first \nevidence, based on U-Pb SHRIMP zircon dating at Sierra de Maz, for a Grenville-age \ngranulite facies metamorphism, leading to the conclusion that a continuous mobile \nbelt existed throughout the proto-Andean margin of Gondwana in Grenvillian times.  \n 3\nGeological setting  \n The Sierra de Maz, along with the nearby sierras of Espinal, Ramaditas and \nAsperecitos (Fig. 1), defines a NNW\u2013SSE trending belt of metamorphic rocks ranging \nfrom high-grade in the east to low-grade in the west. Three parallel domains can be \ndiscriminated in the field, separated by first-order shear zones (Fig. 1). The eastern \ndomain consists of garnet-sillimanite migmatitic paragneisses, few marble outcrops \nand amphibolites. The central domain consists for the most part of medium grade \n(kyanite-sillimanite-garnet-staurolite) schists, quartzites, amphibolites and random \nmarble outcrops. However, in the easternmost part of this domain in the Sierra de Maz  \nthere is a distinct sequence of hornblende - biotite \u2013 garnet gneisses, and biotite - \ngarnet gneisses with some interleaved quartzites and scattered marble lenses. Relics of  \nmafic grunulites and meta-peridotites are locally found within this sequence. Massif-\ntype anorthosites are also found within this central domain, both in Maz and Espinal \n(Fig. 1) (Casquet et al., 2005) and are apparently hosted by the latter sequence of \nrocks. Other rock types of the central domain are orthogneisses and a still poorly \nknown metaplutonic complex of meta-diorites to ortho-amphibolites apparently older \nthan the anorthosites. The third domain, in the west, is formed by two low-grade \nmetasedimentary sequences. One consists for  the most part of garnet - chlorite schist \nwith minor quartzites. The second is dominated by marbles, calc-silicate rocks  and \nCa-pelitic schist and is remarkably similar to the Neoproterozoic Difunta Correa \nsequence of the Sierra de Pie de Palo (Casquet et al., 2001; Rapela et al., 2005).  \n Porcher et al. (2004) reported Sm-Nd garnet\u2013whole rock ages from eastern Sierra \nde Maz of 1039.9 \u00b1 3.1 Ma and 969 \u00b1 20 Ma, interpreted as recording a first thermal \nevent. However, without leaching of garnet to remove apatite and other REE-bearing \nminerals, the meaning of these ages remains uncertain. This region underwent a \n 4\npervasive tectono-thermal event during the Famatinian orogeny, between 435 and 450 \nMa (Casquet et al., 2001, 2005, and unpublished data).  \n We focus here on the eastern part of the central domain, where high-grade rocks \nwere probably host to the anorthosites and might thus preserve evidence of their pre-\nFamatinian history. An imbricated and folded sequence of schists, gneisses, \nquartzites, metabasites and serpentinite bodies crop out at Mina del Grafito (Fig.1): \nhydrothermal graphite was mined here in the past. We chose one schist (MAZ-6063) \nfor U-Pb SHRIMP zircon dating and one metabasite (MAZ-6062) for assessing P-T \nconditions of metamorphism. \n \nSamples description and conditions of metamorphism \n MAZ-6063 is a garnet schist consisting of quartz, biotite, garnet and plagioclase \nwith accessory rutile, ilmenite, zircon, monazite and apatite. Biotite is abundant and \ndefines a foliation that wraps around garnets. Garnet porphyroblasts are subhedral to \nanhedral and are partially replaced by matrix biotite; they have large cores rich in \ninclusions of matrix minerals, particularly rutile, and inclusion-free mantles. The \ngarnet is chemically quite homogeneous (alm55.7\u201364.3, prp26.0\u201334.4, grs6.4\u20138.0, sps1.4\u20132.0); \nplagioclase is unzoned (an33.4\u201334.5, ab64.5\u201366.3, or0.2\u20131.0) and variably sericitized. \n MAZ-6062 is a fine-grained amphibolitized basic granulite with a predominantly \ngranoblastic texture. It consists of plagioclase (an47.0\u201382.4, ab17.0\u201352.8, or0.5\u20131.0), garnet \n(alm48.2\u201353.9, prp24.1\u201328.4, grs19.1\u201322.2, sps1.9\u20132.5), clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, Mg-\nhornblende, biotite and accessory apatite and ilmenite. Its petrography suggests two \nmetamorphic events: an older granulite facies one (M1) forming Opx + Cpx + \nPl1(an70-82) + Grt1 + Bt, and a younger garnet amphibolite facies one (M2) that \nproduced Hbl + Pl2 + Grt2 , the latter as idiomorphic overgrowths on Grt1 (Fig. 2; \n 5\nmineral abreviations after Kretz, 1983). Pressure and temperature for M1 were \nassessed from the presumed equilibrium mineral compositions using Thermocalc v. \n3.1 (Powell & Holland, 1988), and yielded P = 780 \u00b1 140 MPa, and T = 775 \u00b1 95\u00baC \n(Table 1). The pressure suggest a crustal depth of ca. 29 km for this event. \n \nU-Pb SHRIMP geochronology \n A zircon concentrate was obtained from MAZ-6063. The zircons are round to sub-\nround in shape, mostly ca. 100 \uf06dm in diameter. Cathodoluminescence (CL) images \nreveal cores (simply or complexly zoned, often quite small) mantled by complete \novergrowths that often represent >50 % of the grain volume (Fig. 3). The latter are of \ntwo types: thick patchily sector-zoned (\u2018soccer-ball\u2019) zircon, thought to signify high-\ngrade metamorphism at a deep crustal level (e.g., Vavra et al., 1999), and clearer, \nunzoned metamorphic overgrowths. They are rarely identifiable on the same grain, \nbut in such cases the \u2018soccer-ball\u2019 zoning is innermost; there often appears to be a \ngradation between the two types. On many grains there is also a thin outermost rim of \nlower luminescence (<< 10 microns in width). \n U-Pb zircon dating was carried out by sensitive high resolution ion microprobe \n(SHRIMP) using SHRIMP II at ANU, Canberra, targeting 20 areas, including 7 cores \nand 13 overgrowths (Table 2 and fig. 3). The cores have 207Pb\/206Pb ages ranging \nfrom ca. 1000 to 2000 Ma, with apparent peaks at ~1700 and ~1880 Ma. Two cores \nwith younger ages of 1178 \uf0b1 27 and 1063 \uf0b1 57 Ma could represent major radiogenic \nPb-loss during metamorphism. Nine of the ten mantle overgrowths analysed have \n207Pb\/206Pb ages ranging between 1130 and 1370 Ma (ignoring one imprecise result of \n1000 Ma), with a weighted mean of 1208 \uf0b1 28 Ma (MSWD = 3.4). The \u201csoccer ball\u201d-\nzoned domains gave ages of 1180\u20131230 Ma, within this range, and the weighted mean \n 6\nincludes both types (but see below). The thin outermost rims were too thin to analyses \nand, in view of the interpretation below, it is thought that they might represent \nOrdovician metamorphism. \n \nInterpretation of zircon ages \n The simplest interpretation of the U-Pb data is that the original sediment had a late \nPalaeoproterozoic provenance and underwent high-grade metamorphism in the lower \ncrust at about 1200 Ma. Slight radiogenic Pb-loss could have occurred as the rock \nunderwent partial exhumation at 1000\u20131100 Ma. The depositional age is poorly \nconstrained since the number of grains dated is less than that usually considered \nnecessary for a full provenance analysis, but must be between the age of \nmetamorphism and that of the youngest detrital cores at 1.7 Ga.  \n With respect to the metamorphic mantled overgrowths analysed, statistical mixture \nmodelling of the data (using ISOPLOT) suggests one component at ca. 1230 Ma and \nanother at ca. 1180 Ma (with possibly a third slightly younger yet, though this is \nprobably a consequence of radiogenic Pb loss). Nevertheless, the overlap in the ages \nbetween the two types of metamorphic overgrowths suggests that any two such events \noccurred within a relatively short time interval (i.e., within 50 Ma). On the basis of \nthe evenness and completeness of the mantled overgrowths on most grains, the grain-\nshape is interpreted to be the result of metamorphism rather than surface transport. \nTherefore the rock may have been partially exhumed during deep crustal \nmetamorphism, withouth a major drop in temperature, to account for gradation \nbetween the two types of overgrowths. A deep crustal granulite facies metamorphism \n(M1) has been recognized from MAZ-6062, and so it is highly probable that the \n 7\n\u2018soccer-ball\u2019 zircon overgrowths formed \u201cin situ\u201d  and the age of 1208 \uf0b1 28 Ma \nconstrains the timing of that M1 event. The second metamorphism seen in MAZ-6062 \n(M2) is not unambiguously dated: it seems most likely that it was the result of partial \nexhumation immediately following deep crustal metamorphism, without a major drop \nin temperature, which would account for gradation between the two types of mantling \novergrowths. Alternatively, M2 could relate to the undated thin outer zircon rims \n(Famatinian?). \n   \nDiscussion \n The age of  1208 \u00b1 28 Ma of the M1 metamorphic event is broadly coincident with \nthe age of the Elzevirian accretionary orogenic event recorded in the Grenvillian \nProvince of eastern Canada (~ 1250 \u2013 1190 Ma; Rivers, 1997). Corrieveau and van \nBreemen (2000) provided evidence from metamorphic P-T conditions and \ngeochronology that the Grenvillian continent-continent collisional orogeny was \ninitiated at the end of the Elzevirian at ca. 1.2 Ga. In consequence we consider that \nthe M1 metamorphic recognized for the first time in the Sierra de Maz can be taken as \nan early Grenvillian event. The Grenvillian orogeny ended at between 1.0 Ga and 0.85 \nGa (Rivers, 1997).         \n Evidence of a Grenvillian tectonothermal event in the western sierras Pampeanas is \nalso found in the Sierra de Pie de Palo, and in the Arequipa\u2013Antofalla craton (Fig. 1). \nIn the first, metamorphism older than ca. 1.1 Ga was inferred from combined U-Pb \nSHRIMP detrital zircon data and petrographic evidence (Casquet et al., 2001). The \nSierra de Pie de Palo exhibits stacking of Famatinian nappes formed by \nMesoproterozoic meta-igneous rocks with ages of ca. 1.0\u20131.1 Ga (McDonough et al., \n 8\n1993; Pankhurst and Rapela, 1998) and metasedimentary rocks, beneath a \nNeoproterozoic metasedimentary cover (Casquet et al., 2001; Galindo et al., 2004). \nThe lowermost unit is interpreted to represent a Mesoproterozoic oceanic arc\/back arc \ncomplex of ca. 1.2 Ga (Vujovich et al., 2004, and references therein). Thus \ntectonothermal activity took place here in Grenvillian times (ca. 1.0\u20131.2 Ga). Pre-\nFamatinian metamorphism reaching high-grade migmatitic conditions (686 \u00b1 40 MPa, \n790 \u00b1 17\u00baC) has only been recognized in the basement of the upper nappes (Casquet \net al., 2001). These P-T values are within error of those inferred for M1 in eastern \nSierra de Maz, thus strengthening the idea that both regions underwent the same \nmetamorphic event. Within the Western Sierras Pampeanas, orthogneisses of \nGrenvillian age have also been found in the Sierra de Umango (Varela et al,. 2004), \nnorthwest of the Sierra de Espinal (Fig. 1). \n The Arequipa\u2013Antofalla craton (Ramos, 1988) lies to the northwest of the Sierras \nPampeanas in Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile and Argentina (Fig. 1), and exhibits \nscattered inliers of rocks of Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic age, exposed through the \nAndean Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic cover sequence. It was \napparently accreted to the Amazonian craton to the east during the Sunsas orogeny at \nca. 1.0\u20131.2 Ga according to Loewy et al. (2004). The northern and central parts \nconsist of Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks, metavolcanic rocks and \northogneisses, the latter with peak U-Pb zircon crystallization ages of ca. 1.8\u20131.9 Ga \nin the north and ca. 1.05\u20131.25 Ga in the central region (Damm et al., 1990; Wasteneys \net al., 1995; Tosdal, 1996; Loewy et al., 2004). Grenville-age medium- to high-grade \n(granulite) metamorphism and deformation overprinted both domains between ca. \n1200 and 950 Ma (Wasteneys at al., 1995; Loewy et al., 2004), and the region \n 9\nunderwent Famatinian metamorphism and magmatism between 470 and 440 Ma \n(Loewy et al., 2004).  \n  From the above, the similarities between central and northern Arequipa\u2013Antofalla \ncraton and the Western Sierras Pampeanas are evident, the igneous event at 1.8 Ga to \n1.9 Ga being recorded by the zircon cores of MAZ-6063 with 207Pb\/206Pb peak ages at \n~1700 and ~1880 Ma. This suggests that the source of MAZ-6063 zircons was \u2013 at \nleast in part \u2013 an igneous province similar to the northern and central Arequipa\u2013\nAntofalla orthogneisses. Still more important is the conclusion that magmatism and \nregional metamorphism attaining granulite facies conditions occurred in both regions \nbetween ca. 1.2 Ga and ca. 1.0 Ga, suggesting that they were probably part of the \nsame mobile belt of Grenvillian age. These parallels extend to the existence of \nGrenvillian massif-type anorthosites in both the Western Sierras Pampeanas (Casquet \net al., 2005) and the northern Arequipa\u2013Antofalla domain (Martignole et al., 2005), \nand both regions were reworked by Famatinian metamorphism at ca. 450 Ma. Thus it \nis suggested that these two regions were part of a single continental crustal block from \nMesoproterozoic times onwards (Fig. 1). The Sierra de Pie de Palo pre-Famatinian \nbasement was probably part of this same Grenville-age mobile belt, although it \ncontains an ophiolitic assemblage that has not been recognized so far in the \nnorthwestern Sierras Pampeanas or \u2013 as far as we are aware \u2013 in the Arequipa\u2013\nAntofalla craton. Thus, like the Arequipa\u2013Antofalla block (e.g., Loewy et al., 2004) \nthe Western Sierras Pampeanas must be considered autochthonous or \nparautochthonous to the pre-Famatinian margin of Gondwana, and not part of the \nPrecordillera terrane, in further agreement with recent isotope and zircon provenance \nevidence (Galindo et al., 2004; Vujovich et al., 2004).  \n 10\n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by Spanish (BTE2001-1486) and Argentine public grants. \nR.J.P. acknowledges a NERC Small Research Grant.  \n \nReferences \nCasquet, C., Baldo, E., Pankhurst, R.J., Rapela, C.W., Galindo, C., Fanning, C.M. and \nSaavedra, J.
