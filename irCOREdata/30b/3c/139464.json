Thus\npower can be an impediment to furthering CSR strategy and activities at the individual and organizational level.\nKEY WORDS: corporate social responsibility, implementation, power, resource dependence theory, case study,\nempirical\nThis article presents case evidence to illustrate a simple but significant point: the literature assumes that an\nincrease in power associated with CSR is positive because it has benefi ts for a range of stakeholders.\nTherefore, there is a positive association between an increase in the power of CSR and stakeholder benefits. In\npractice this is not the case always. In fact in some organizations, the more powerful CSR becomes, the more\nthis power becomes an obstacle to implementing CSR systems, processes and initiatives that will generate\nthese benefits. Therefore, an increase in power of CSR can be either of no benefit, or negatively impact the\nvast majority of stakeholders when this power causes stagnation in its development and implementation.\nThe stagnation results from a process whereby the power associated with CSR increases, causing the potential\npower of individuals with CSR responsibilities inside organizations to also increase. Some managers recognize\nthe potential for using CSR to improve their own power position, and may have little interest in promoting\nand developing CSR within the organization. This causes a power struggle between actors who attempt to control\nCSR in different ways to improve thei r own power. This struggle can undermine development and imple-\nmentation efforts, as attentions and priorities of managers are turned towards it and not CSR.\nTherefore, CSR is distinct from other topics within business, such as quality control, profit maximization or marketing\nin two ways: first, power is thought to have a positive effect on CSR because as it becomes more powerful it results\nin more activity at the organizational level; and second, some contributions emphasize values\/morality-based or\nethical theories of CSR (e.g. see Garriga and Mele, 2004) which emphasize it as \u2018the right thing to do\u2019. As\nsuch, we would expect that CSR therefore might be less susceptible to power relations than other business\nimperatives. This case illustrates that both of these assumptions may not hold true in practice, and that due to the\nlink between CSR and the personal ethics of those responsible for it, the power struggle may in fact be more\nintense than other business imperatives and therefore needs to be carefully managed.\nA resource dependence perspective is thus used to illustrate this paradox of power in CSR and the need for further\nresearch on the effects of power on CSR.\nCSR and power\nAlthough power is an important concept with regard to CSR1, there is little to be found in the literature dealing\nspecifically with it (Gordon, 2005) and how it impacts CSR implementation. The few articles that discuss\npower do so in a more generalized sense without discussing what power is, or specifically how it impacts the\nissues under discussion (e.g. Hamann and Acutt, 2003; Hilton, 2003; Newell, 2005). However, it is these\narticles that suggest an increase in power for CSR is positive because it allows a range of stakeholder groups\nto \u2018increase their own bargaining power\u2019 (Hamann and Acutt, 2003, p. 260) in relation to corporations and thus\nby implication, work towards better meeting their own needs. Thus, power of CSR is positive because it is thought\nto create opportunities for traditionally less powerful groups such as employees, communities, those representing\nthe environment, etc. to work with companies, to mitigate the impacts of production and to address their\nneeds in conjunction with organizations. This primarily implicit assumption is found in much of the CSR\nliterature (e.g. Aguilera and Cuervo-Cazurra, 2004; Blowfield, 2004; Davis, 1973; Sethi, 2002).\nLiterature focussed on implementing CSR, also tends not to include issues related to power, and focuses\nprimarily on linear or staged models to describe both current implementation practices, and theorize on ideal\nprocesses, structures and considerations (e.g. Adam and Rachman-Moore, 2004; Carlisle and Faulkner, 2004;\nCramer, 2005; EFQM, n.d.; Elkington, 1997; Government of Canada, 2006; Labour Behind the Label, n.d.;\nNelson, 1999; van Marrewijk et al., 2004; Veser, 2004). Most of these implementation models have similar\ncomponents that include: conducting a CSR assessment, creating a CSR strategy (often in conjunction with key\nstakeholders) and identifying the specific commitments to be made, creating monitoring and reporting systems\n(and in some cases identifying key performance indicators), identifying appropriate communication channels for\ndifferent audiences and reviewing performance on a regular basis. Other works such as Frenkel (2001). Mamic\n(2004) and Wood et al. (2004) which provide rich descriptions of CSR implementation efforts also do not speak\nin any depth about how power impacts the development or implementation of CSR within organizations.\nMainly, the work on CSR implementation focuses on increasing effectiveness through improving organizational\nstructures and processes, such as governance, training and awareness, sanctions, etc. Thus, the vast majority of\nexisting CSR literature does not discuss the power implications of CSR and of those who are in control of\nCSR development and implementation within the organization.\nMuch of the management literature on power starts either from definitions that describe power as an ability, a\npotential ability, or access to resource(s) that allows an individual or group to influence or carry out their own will\nor interests (e.g. Fiol et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2005; Salancik and Pfeffer, 1977; Vredenburgh and Brender,\n1988; Weber, 1947; Whitmeyer, 2001), or that describe different types or dimensions of power (e.g. Furnham,\n2005; Gaventa and Cornwall, 2001; Hardy and Leiba-O\u2019Sullivan, 1998; Lukes, 1974) where power is not a\nfixed, structural characteristic (e.g. Abel, 2005; Faubion, 1994; Hosking and Morley, 1991). There is a vast\nrange of literature on power looking at specific elements such as buyer\u2013supplier relationships (e.g. Hingley,\n2005; Kumar, 2005), training and development (e.g. Garavan et al., 1993), mentoring relationships (e.g. Ragins,\n1997), managers and their use or non-use of power (e.g. Kotter, 1977; Richardson and Swan, 1997), the\nrelationship between supervisory power and organizational values (e.g. Atwater, 1995), or broader issues of power\nsuch as organizational politics and game playing (e.g. McKenna, 2000; Mintzberg, 1983; Pettigrew, 1973).\nThe conception of power used in this study starts from Whitmeyer\u2019s (2001) definition that power is the ability\nof an actor to obtain his\/her interests, but this does not assume that it is a static or fixed resource that belongs to\na person, group or position, etc. Power is something that is not inherently positive or negative and is available\nto anyone. Indiv i d ua l s a nd gro u ps i n t e r a c t a nd en ga ge i n \u2018heterogeneous one-on-one adjustments of\ndominance and resistance\u2019 (Foucault, 1979 in Abel, 2005), which in some cases are reinforced through repetition.\nWhen this occurs, these behaviours become patterns and create power relationships, where resources (such as\nbases and sources of power or influence tactics) are used to both maintain and resist the relationships. Thus,\npower can be understood as a set of entrenched relationships that can be changed through re-evaluation and\nexamination, but where parties involved use the resources at their disposal to change or maintain the power\nrelationship as best suits their interests. Thus, a resource-based view of power and a relational view of power\nare not mutually exclusive and help to more accurately conceptualize how power works in pract ice.\nAccording to Salancik and Pfeffer (1977), power \u2018while it eludes definition, is easy enough to recognize by its\nconsequences \u2013 the ability of those who possess power to bring about the outcomes they desire\u2019 (p. 3).\nAccording to resource dependence theory, this ability to bring about desired outcomes is constrained by the\nenvironment in which an organization operates (Boyd, 1990; Oliver, 1991; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978\/2003). While\nit has received limited attention in the CSR literature (e.g. Corcoran and Shackman, 2007; Frooman, 1999;\nGreening and Gray, 1994), there is a relatively rich tradition within the general management literature. Because\norganizations do not control all resources needed in order to operate, they must come up with other strategies to\ngain access to these resources and to manage uncertainties within their operating environment. Many respond\nwith such strategies as creating relationships, or interdependencies, with others to gain access to resources (e.g.\nBoyd, 1990; Greening and Gray, 1994), merging with or acquiring other organizations (e.g. Campling and\nMitchelson, 1998; Casciaro and Jan Piskorski, 2005) and\/or bringing in individuals with resources needed by the\norganization (e.g. Daily and Dalton, 1994; Hillman et al., 2000). Within the interdependencies, and\nconstraints and opportunities of their operating environment (Bloodgood and Morrow, 2003), managers exercise\na degree of discretion that is mediated by how well al igned the external environment is (Powell, 1988 in\nGreening and Gray, 1994) and by power relationships between parties (Bloodgood and Morrow, 2003; Hillman et\nal., 2000; Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985). Individuals who are able to reduce organizational uncertainties and secure\naccess to key resources such as legitimacy, reputation and credibility (Daily and Dalton, 1994; Gales and Kesner,\n1994), thereby increasing discretion and control, become powerful members within the organization (Pfeffer and\nSalancik, 1978\/2003).\nWhile it is true that individuals who provide these services to the organization around CSR have the potential to\nimprove their own power within the organization, managers also recognize the potential personal gains for\n\u2018solving\u2019 the CSR problem and struggle for control over it internally. During the course of the struggle, both\nthe \u2018constraint absorption\u2019 (Casciaro and Jan Piskorski, 2005) and opportunity identification activities\n(Bloodgood and Morrow, 2003) for further engaging in CSR become ignored.\nTherefore, there is a paradox of power within CSR. The CSR literature indicates that as CSR becomes\nmore powerful, business will increasingly be expected to engage in a range of CSR activities with the express\npurpose of benefiting impacted stakeholders. However, counter to the literature, data from this research\nsuggests that as CSR becomes more powerful within society and thus becomes a more significant constraint\nwithin the operating environment for business, the rewards associated with controlling it can cause\nconflict within the organization, resulting in CSR activities being ignored. In other words, as CSR increases\nin power, some organizations may find a decrease in the amount of work done to fur ther develop and\nimplement their CSR strategy. Also, because CSR is articulated by scholars and practitioners alike as being\nfundamentally underpinned by \u2018good ethics\u2019 (see Aguilera et al., 2007; Garriga and Mele, 2004; Meehan\net al., 2006; Windsor, 2006), the personal ethics of those involved in the struggle are brought into focus and\nare used to prove \u2018worthiness\u2019 (TRO1) of being involved with CSR, thereby intensifying the struggle.\nAs indicated by Salancik and Pfeffer (1977) above, power can be recognized by its consequences, and thus it is\npossible to observe the details of a power struggle over CSR by observing the power bases individuals ascribe\nto and the influence tactics they use.\nTools for observing the use of power within organizations\nManagers who recognize the increase in power associated with CSR have a number of tactics at their\ndisposal to strengthen their association and cont rol over the direction of CSR within the organization.\nWork on power bases (e.g. French and Raven, 1959; Yukl and Falbe, 1991), and influence tactics (e.g. Kipnis et\nal., 1980; Yukl and Tracey, 1992) are useful in analyzing the behaviour of individuals within an\norganizational setting to show where they believe their power comes from (what power sources they refer to)\nand what tactics they are using to change the level of power they already have within the organization (power\nchange and use tactics). Therefore, the two tools represented in Tables I and II can be used to identify how\nsome managers are using the opportunities associated with an increase in power of CSR to realize the rewards of\ndealing with related uncertainties and resource acquisition.\nTable I - Eight sources of power inside organizations (Yukl and Falbe, 1991)\nType of power Description\nPosition Power\nLegitimate\nReward\nCoercive\nInformation\nPersonal power\nExpert\nPersuasive\nReferent\nCharisma\nThe actor has the right, considering his\/her position and the target\u2019s job responsibilities, to expect\nthe target to comply with legitimate request(s)\nThe actor is able to give special benefits or reward to people, and the target finds it advantageous\nto trade favours\nThe actor can make things difficult for people and the target wants to avoid getting the actor angry\nThe actor has access to information not available to the target and this information convinces the\ntarget that the actor is right\nThe actor has the experience and knowledge to earn the target\u2019s respect and the target defers to\nthe actor\u2019s judgement in some matters\nThe actor\u2019s logical arguments convince the target that the request or recommendation is the best\nway to accomplish an objective or get a task done\nThe target likes the actor and enjoys doing things for him\/her\nThe actor is very charismatic and is able to appeal to the target\u2019s values and inspire the target\u2019s\nenthusiasm for a task\nMethods\nAccording to Mintzberg (1979) \u2018measuring in real organizational terms means first of all getting out into the field,\ninto real organizations. Questionnaires often won\u2019t do\u2019 (p. 586).\nPower is a socially embedded, context-dependent phenomenon requiring research methods that can take context\nand situational factors into account (e.g. Mintzberg, 1983; Pettigrew, 1977; Pfeffer, 1981). It also requires methods\nwhere behaviours involved in power relationships can be observed in their natural setting (e.g. Bonoma, 1985;\nLueger et al., 2005) due to the likelihood that research participants are \u2018reluctant to admit that they are\nmotivated by fear of punishment or desire for rewards and may attribute compliance to ... reasons, such as\nfriendship with the agent\u2019 (Yukl and Falbe, 1991, p. 416). Therefore a study of power requires inductive,\niterative, observation-based methods that are situated within the natural context of the observable behaviours.\nThis research seeks to understand the \u2018world as it is\u2019 and to \u2018understand the fundamental nature of the social\nworld at the level of subjective experience (Burrell and Morgan, 1979, p. 28), thus falling into what Burrell and\nMorgan (1979) call the interpretive paradigm. This paradigm is focussed on the creation of meaning within\ncertain contexts and how those meanings and experiences are understood to constitute social action (Baker,\n2001; Schwandt, 2000; Spiggle, 1994). The researcher acts as an interpreter, who attempts to identify meanings\nassociated with a particular social action and processes through such things as conversation and interaction,\nand thus attempts to understand the subjective meaning of action in an objective manner (Mason, 2002;\nSchwandt, 2000), or by making strange that which is normal by challenging our own preconceived notions about\nthe process in question (Baker, 2002; Toren, 1996). Objectivity in this sense refers to the researcher\u2019s ability\nand willingness to listen to and \u2018give voice\u2019 to participants (Strauss and Corbin, 1998, p. 43). Within this\nprocess of interpreting, the researcher responds as a whole person and acts as \u2018an instrument in observation,\nselection, coordination and interpretation of data\u2019 (Spiggle, 1994, p. 492).\nTable II - Nine influence tactics (Yukl and Tracey, 1992)\nInfluence tactics Description\nCoalition\nConsultation\nExchange\nIngratiation\nInspirational appeal\nLegitimating\nRational persuasion\nPersonal appeal\nPressure\nThe actor seeks the aid of others to persuade the target to do something or uses the support of\nothers as a reason for the target to agree also\nThe actor seeks the target\u2019s participation in planning a strategy, activity or change for which\nthe target\u2019s support and assistance are desired, or the actor is willing to modify a proposal to\ndeal with the target\u2019s concerns and suggestions\nThe actor offers an exchange of favours, indicates willingness to reciprocate at a later time, or\npromises to share the benefits if the target accomplishes a task\nThe actor seeks to get the target in a good mood or to think favourably of him\/her before asking\nthe target to do something\nThe actor makes a request or proposal that arouses enthusiasm by appealing to the target\u2019s\nvalues, ideals and aspirations or by increasing the target\u2019s confidence that he\/she can do it\nThe actor seeks to establish the legitimacy of a request by claiming authority or right to make it\nor by verifying that it is consistent with organizational, policies, rules, practices or traditions\nThe actor uses logical arguments and factual evidence to persuade the target that a proposal of\nrequest is viable and likely to result in the attainment of task objectives\nThe actor appeals to the target\u2019s feelings of loyalty and friendship towards him or her before\nasking the target to do something\nThe actor uses demands, threats or persistent reminders to influence the target to do what he or\nshe wants\nCase research is most appropriate as it allows the researcher to interact with the participants through multiple\nmethods (interviews, document analysis, participant observation and direct observation) in the context in which\nthese activities take place and which therefore serve to improve both the validity and reliability of the\ninformation gathered (Bonoma, 1985; Eisenhardt, 1989; Scholz and Tietje, 2002; Van Maanen, 1988; Yin,\n2003). It also allows for investigating complex phenomenon that are underdeveloped in the literature (Baker,\n2001; Scholz and Tietje, 2002; Strauss and Corbin, 1998; Vinten, 1994; Yin, 2003) as is clearly the case\nwith the impact of power on the development and implementation of CSR.\nIn investigating the influence of power on CSR development and implementation within a single UK MNC,\nit was important to understand the phenomenon from a practical perspective and therefore was data-led.\nAs such, the research began from an inductive, unstructured approach, where no single theory or hypothesis was\ntested (Baker, 2002; Crane, 2000; Eisenhardt, 1989), and where theory emerged from the data (e.g.\nMintzberg, 1979; Pettigrew, 2000; Strauss and Corbin, 1998).\nTherefore, a single unstructured, exploratory case was identified to provide further insight into the influence\nthat power has on the development and implementation of CSR strategy (Scholz and Tietje, 2002; Vinten, 1994;\nYin, 2003).\nCase selection and data collection\nThe case company is a UK MNC in the global tourism industry. It was selected because previous research\nindicates that larger organizations are more likely to be working on CSR (Maignan and Ralston, 2002), and in this\ncase, both the company and the industry are unremarkable or typical in nature (Miles and Huberman, 1994).\nThe company is indistinguishable from its competition and neither led or lagged behind other companies\ncompeting in the same market with regard to its core business and to CSR. For instance they offer similar if not\nthe same products and prices as their competitors due to such things as volume bed purchasing at hotels where\nmultiple vendors have contracts, targeting the same locations around the world for holiday destinations, employees\nwho regularly move between this company and their competitors and themselves indicate little difference\nbetween organizations and targeting and advertising to the same market segment in the UK.2The staff involved in\nCSR development and implementation were not specialists in the field, nor did their knowledge lag behind the\naverage individual working in any junior management position in an average company.\nThis international tourism industry is also unremarkable when it comes to CSR development and implementation.\nIt has begun to be affected by certain issues, such as climate change and changing weather patterns in\ndestination communities and therefore is in early stages of responding to CSR considerations. Thus, the\nindustry is not considered to be a leader on CSR issues, such as mining or oil and gas industries, nor does it lag\nsignificantly behind most industries, such as the case with insurance or electrical component industries.\nTherefore, this case is unremarkable in every sense and is potentially the representative of any number of\ncompanies at ear ly s tages of CSR development and implementation that has little internal impetus for\nmaking CSR a priority.\nOver 100 h of direct observation, document analysis, and 12 formal, semi-structured interviews (resulting in\n11.5 h of interview time ranging from 30 to 75 min in length) have been conducted with senior managers to\ndate. Four focus groups were also run with 17 mid- and junior-level managers resulting in an additional 6 h of\ncontact time. All information gathered from interviews, focus groups, participant observation, direct\nobservation and documents was analyzed using the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967;\nSpiggle, 1994).\nCase details\nCompany X\nCompany X appeared to be in a state of mild confusion regarding CSR. Until the beginning of 2005, CSR was\nseen as something that affected other companies and was not of any real concern to them internally or\nindustry-wide. By 2000, companies were aware that external groups were talking about CSR in relation to the\nindustry but showed little concern until 2003\u20132004 when the other major competitors appointed CSR\nmanagers. To ensure they did not lag sufficiently behind their competition, they also appointed a CSR\nmanager, but CSR was not seen either as an opportunity or as a threat. However, in 2006, not only did the NGOs\nbecome louder and the government talk about stiffer climate change regulations (neither of which had really af-\nfected Company X in the past), their key investor asked for specific information regarding CSR-related\npolicies and practices. Due to the weak financial position of Company X, and the large proportion of\nshares owned by the investor, Company X was significantly \u2018power-disadvantaged\u2019, providing the investor\nwith the opportunity to have significant influence on activities and decision making of Company X (Casciaro\nand Jan Piskorski, 2005). By raising the importance and urgency of CSR policies and activities within\nCompany X, it gave those in control of CSR \u2018a louder voice at the table\u2019 (TRO1 1), where managers\nrecognized the rewards associated with \u2018managing CSR\u2019. Thus, the investor increased not only the visibility\nand credibility of CSR within the organization, but also of those engaged in CSR activities.\nThe two rival camps\nIt became evident early-on in the research that two rival CSR \u2018camps\u2019 were developing. According to\nMintzberg (1983), rival camps are any groups at the same level whose purpose is to defeat each other in the\nquest for power. Company X began the process of CSR development and implementation with the hiring of the\nCSR manager in 2004 and her creation of a policy on CSR that they published on their website. She was\nresponsible for the development and implementation of all CSR efforts within the organization, with the\nexception of technical environmental issues. The CSR manager sat within Department 1 with two reporting\nlevels above her. This position was characterized by little resource, authority or control over organizational\npractices (TRI10 and TRI3), but as the only position within the company tasked with CSR activities, the CSR\nmanager retained large control over how CSR was shaped unt i l mid-2006 when the insti tut ional investor\nstepped in.\nWhen the request was received from their key investor in 2006, it came through Department 2, which had\noperational responsibility for dealing with most external stakeholders. The company secretary indicated the\ncompany\u2019s response to this request would be four or five pages at the end of the 2006 annual report, and would\nbe informed by a planning document on CSR to be written by a mid-level manager from within Department\n2. This manager, in conjunction with his senior manager, worked with other senior managers who had\noperational responsibility for certain aspects of \u2018CSR\u2019, such as human resources, the airline, health and\nsafety, communications and property maintenance, who each wrote a small review of what they were doing\nwith regard to it. The Department 2 manager and his boss wrote the final 4\u20135 paged report. No definition of CSR\nhad been put forward and it was the planning document created by Department 2 manager that informed the\ncompany\u2019s thinking of CSR for this report. Although aware of the CSR manager, she was not included in\nthese activities until much later in the process as a result of lobbying at higher levels within the organization by\nher senior manager (TRO2).\nA shared disinterest\nInterestingly, one key area of similarity between the two camps was their disinterest in CSR. Neither the CSR\nmanager nor the Department 2 manager was personally interested in CSR. The CSR manager was hired into the\nposition having no prior experience in any related field and indicated she has \u2018learned everything she knows\nabout CSR on the job and from the Internet\u2019. She accepted the position because it sounded interesting and\nshe had recently been made redundant (TRO1). She was uninterested in engaging with senior managers,\nhaving only met or had contact with less than half of them 18 months after starting in the CSR role, and had\nno plans to engage them in the near future. She spent most of her time working with industry bodies on CSR\nand sustainability issues and chose not to engage internally (TRO1). In fact neither she, nor her two line\nmanagers showed any particular interest in improving their existing CSR strategy or in pushing for it at\nhigher levels within the organization (TRO1 and 2).\nThe Department 2 manager suggested that although he had some personal interest in CSR and ethics such\nas \u2018recycling and being trustworthy\u2019 (TRO11), he would move ahead with CSR in whatever way he was\ninstructed to by the head of Department 2. He was not interested in CSR beyond how it was defined by his\nboss, who was well known to be very negative and dismissive of CSR (TRO 1, 2 and TRI 14). Despite the fact\nthat both of these individuals had indicated little personal interest in engaging further with CSR development\nand implementation within the organization, both individuals, and their departments, were intent on being in\ncontrol of it and used power sources and influence tactics to further control the CSR agenda within their\norganization, as will be seen in the following sections. This behaviour suggests that these managers, while\ndetermined to control it, were focussed more on using CSR as a platform for improving their own power\npositions rather than on improving CSR activities within the organization and resulting benefits to stakeholders.\nWhile some of these factors existed prior to the investor\u2019s demand for information on CSR, it was the need to\nrespond that put the two departments and the two managers in particular, into direct and open conflict.\nTherefore, the writing of the 4\u20135 paged report (as the response to the investor) signified the first shifts in power: the\nneed to retain strong ties to the investor and thus a key resource by signalling existing and future CSR efforts created\na constraint within the operational environment but also gave those tasked with different elements of CSR the\nability to improve their own position within the organization by reducing the uncertainty around CSR.\nThus, the increase in individual power associated with reducing organizational uncertainty around CSR meant\nthat the managers were keen to be in control of it and this brought them into direct conflict.\nStr ug g l e fo r c ontro l ov er C SR\nThus, two rival CSR \u2018camps\u2019 developed. Mainly, both camps used similar tactics but to different ends. Camp 1\n(CSR) made claims of legitimate and expert power (see Table III) based on the fact that they have the formal\nauthority within the organization for the CSR function and know more about it than anyone else. They\nformally stated a triple bottom line philosophy (Elkington, 1997) that in practice focussed on industry\ncollaboration and supply chain compliance, and used coalition\/pressure, ingratiation\/personal appeal to\nencourage others to support their claims for control over CSR.\nCamp 2 (Department 2), made claims consistent with legitimate and expert sources of power but which stemmed\nfrom being responsible for key stakeholders and being experts in the practicalities associated with running a successful\nbusiness. While they also formally stated a triple bottom line philosophy, in practice they focussed on CSR as a \u2018tick\nbox\u2019 exercise where the minimum expectation was met, and also used the same three groups of influence tactics to\nencourage support of their position regarding CSR. Table III summarizes the key differences between the\npositions of Camp 1 and Camp 2.\nSources of power\nCamp 1 claimed their legitimate power by virtue of being formally tasked within the organization to work on\nCSR. They had formal authority through the position of CSR manager who was dedicated to investigating\nand implementing CSR within the organization. This is the primary basis upon which they claimed legitimate\npower for all CSR activities within the organization. Camp 2\u2019s claim for legitimate power focussed on the fact\nthat CSR was only of substantial interest to this one external stakeholder and they were formally tasked with\nmaintaining relationships with outside stakeholders. Therefore, understanding, defining and responding to their\nstakeholders on CSR is a part of what their position required and therefore became part of their formal tasks.\nThey were also given legitimate power by virtue of being tasked with organizing and writing the CSR pages\nfor the annual report.\nIn terms of expert power, both camps claimed to better understand CSR and it\u2019s important elements, who the key\nstakeholders are and how to work with them for the benefit of Company X. Most of the disagreement and the\nlever for attempting to \u2018prove\u2019 expert power was based on how the camps defined CSR and its important\nelements. For instance, Camp 1 formally defined CSR according to the triple bottom line. However, when\ntalking about the organization and the type of initiatives it should be involved in, this camp tended to talk more\nabout issues outside the organization, in particular those issues being dealt with by industry associations, such as\nsustainability assessments or audit programmes for the supply chain in destinations. The focus was on working\nwith industry bodies on issues that have general consensus at industry level. The other focus was on internal\ninitiatives that were non-controversial, such as a recycling policies and energy efficiency practices, such as\nlow-energy light bulbs. Both internal initiatives had been underway for over 12 months prior to the first field\nvisit and were still in development at the end of field work. Very little time was spent discussing the internal\nenvironment and working with others inside the business to improve the visibility, participation and action\non CSR strategy and initiatives.\nTable III - Summary of positions for Camp 1 and Camp 2\nPositions Camp 1 Camp 2\nSpecific areas\nReasons to improve\nposition with the\norganization\nMaintain job as CSR manager, gain\ncontrol over how CSR\nconceptualized so as to accentuate\nits importance within the\norganization, formalize CSR\nfunction within the organization to\nimprove internal networks, improve\nposition of power and influence\nGain control over how CSR is conceptualized\nso as to minimize it within the organization\nand retain status quo, leading to improved\ninternal networks, particularly with the\nboss and improve position of power and\ninfluence\nClaims of legitimate\npower\nFormally tasked with CSR\nresponsibility\nFormally tasked with responsibility for\ncommunication with external stakeholders,\nand these are the stakeholders with\nconcern over CSR\nClaims of expert power More accurate understanding of CSR More appropriate business understanding\nof CSR\nDefinition of CSR Formal: being responsible for social,\nenvironmental and economic impacts\nInformal: involvement with\nindustry groups to focus on\nimproving CSR practice within\nsupply chain (destination\ncommunities), focus on issues\nexternal to the organization except\nrecycling within the office\nFormal: taking social, environmental and\neconomic considerations into account\nwhile ensuring effective corporate\ngovernance and realistic assessment of the\nbalance between traditional business goals\nand non-financial responsibilities\nInformal: a tick-box exercise for external\nstakeholders which does not over\ncommit the company in the future and\nshows the company in the most positive\nlight\nMost common tactics\nemployed\nCoalition\/pressure: support of boss\n(senior manager and head of\ndepartment), CSR will fail if left to\nCamp 2 because no support or ability\nto attract resources, encourage\nsupport of other senior managers\nbased on who already belongs in the\ncamp, traditional business perspective\nresult in negative consequences for\nCSR and the company\nIngratiation\/personal appeal: used\nto encourage people to agree when\nthey were suspected of not agreeing,\nget external CSR \u2018expert\u2019 to agree\nwith CSR perspective\nEthical person: I\u2019m a more ethical\nperson and therefore should be in\ncharge of CSR\nCoalition\/pressure: support of boss (senior\nmanager and head of department), CSR\nwill fail if left to Camp 1 because no\nsupport or ability to attract resources,\nencourage support of other senior managers\nbased on who already belongs in the camp,\nwider stakeholder perspective result in\nnegative consequences for CSR and the\ncompany, Department 2 is more powerful\nand will be awarded control of CSR anyway\nIngratiation\/personal appeal: used to get\nexternal CSR \u2018expert\u2019 to agree with CSR\nperspective\nEthical person: I\u2019m a more ethical person\nand therefore should be in charge of CSR\nThe Paradox of Power in CSR 10\nCamp 1 therefore believed their expert power came from their work with competitors on CSR issues, from\nattending industry led conferences, and from having written the CSR policy. Camp 1 felt that Camp 2\nshould not be in control of CSR because \u2018[Camp 2 manager] knows nothing about CSR and doesn\u2019t care\nabout it. He will just do what he\u2019s told and that\u2019s it, he won\u2019t do it in the right way\u2019 (TRO1).\nCamp 2, however, claimed an error in thinking on the part of Camp 1 around governance, and as such, laid\nits own claim of expert knowledge. The manager from Camp 2 indicated that \u2018 ...most people who are involved in\nCSR have absolutely no interest in corporate governance. Now I see that as being a part of CSR, but [the\nCSR manager] is just not interested in governance\u2019 (TRI11). He also claimed that without considerations of\ngovernance, CSR would be just another \u2018touchy feely\u2019 (TRI3) or \u2018airy fairy\u2019 (TRI1 0) idea that would not be\nundertaken by Company X, which was supported in interviews with other senior managers. And while also\nformally defining CSR by its triple bottom line considerations, when asked about the specific initiatives the\ncompany was and should be undertaking, this camp tended to articulate the need to be \u2018realistic\u2019 about the\nappropriate balance between traditional business concerns and CSR issues. They also emphasized the need to use\nexternal communications that put the company in the most positive light possible, without committing or\nobliging the company to any future actions, or put it at reputational or legal risk.\nTRI1 1: so, my aim is to get a piece of work that\u2019s honest, that\u2019s open, that doesn\u2019t stretch the truth, that doesn\u2019t on the\nother side that doesn\u2019t commit the business uh unfairly, or tie its hands in the future ... because we don\u2019t see it as being\nparticularly relevant to staff, or customers, largely uh a few external bodies, investors who want to tick the box and for\ninstitutional uh investor bodies.\nCSR within this camp was defined as meeting the minimum to comply with ethical standards, as \u2018a tick-box\nexercise\u2019.\nTherefore, both camps claimed that they should control CSR within the organization because they were\nresponsible for the important tasks surrounding CSR development and implementation, and had the\nappropriate expert knowledge to make it a success within the organization. Thus, each camp argued that i t\nwas better suited to reduce the uncertainty of CSR.\nBut which arguments were most persuasive with other senior managers? Most found the legitimate power\nassociated with the CSR manager post to be more persuasive than the Department 2 manager being tasked\nwith the 4\u20135 paged report. When discussing where the CSR function should be held within the organization, 3\nof the 12 senior managers believed the CSR function should remain where it was, with the CSR manager. Two\nfurther senior managers indicated that CSR responsibility should stay within Department 1, but should be\nheld at a senior management level. Therefore, 5 of the 12 managers indicated CSR should remain within\nDepartment 1 and therefore cont inue to have functional control over it. Only three managers\nindicated that CSR should be moved to Department 2 and one manager indicated it should not be in\nDepartment 2 due to the implications it would have for the nature of CSR within the organization. Thus,\nlegitimate power was a persuasive argument for Camp 1 to retain control over CSR.\nCamp 2 however, was not only better aligned with the key resources of the organization (and thus a more\npowerful department), but also defined CSR more in line with the traditional business concerns. By defining\nCSR as a compliance activity requiring few additional resources and minimal effort, and by demonstrating their\nexpert knowledge on managing traditional business concerns, Camp 2 removed the majority of uncertainty\nsurrounding CSR within the organization. Many senior managers were more in support of this definition of CSR\nand were happy for Camp 2 to control the response to the institutional investor. Camp 2\u2019s efforts made CSR a less\nsignificant issue that was manageable with the existing skills and competencies held by Camp 2. While this allowed\nthem to maintain control over the 4\u20135 paged CSR report, it is unclear whether their \u2018expert\u2019 status would\nhave allowed them to take further control of other CSR activities in the long-term.\nClearly, the legitimate power source for Camp 1 and the expert power source for Camp 2 were quite strong at the\nsenior level within the organization; however, the strength of arguments for both camps meant that a\ndetermination over control of CSR was difficult. The conflict was also allowed to continue because little time and\nattention had been given to CSR issues at the senior management level. In the previous 3 years, it had never\nbeen on the agenda or debated at a senior management meeting (TRI8), nor was there any historical mention\nof it (TRI10). Also, the senior manager in charge of Department 1 was believed to be uninterested in\npromoting CSR at senior management level.\nTRI1 0: I think [CSR manager]\u2019s battling on her own at the moment, its actually quite difficult for her in her position uhm\nto network and influence the company . . . it should be [senior manager for Department 1] who\u2019s taking what she has\ndone and is doing and her ideas and politicking and influencing for her at a senior level, increasing that sort of visibility\nuhm and then you\u2019ll find that it becomes much more of an issue there... but its all its all about managing influence, you\nknow she\u2019s doing an awful lot of work around herself and she\u2019s got a lot of people interested in what she does including\nmyself. Uhm but unless she starts to say to [senior manager for Department 1] what are you doing about this for me,\nright, and [senior manager for Department 1] is passionate about doing something about it . .. and I don\u2019t see the\npassion there at the senior level for this other than it\u2019s a pain in the butt\u2019\nTherefore, the lack of passion at senior management level in combination with the lack of direction from the\ncompany executive (i.e. no company definition of CSR or formal authority for CSR at the board level, etc.)\nexacerbated the organizational uncertainty surrounding CSR and thus the conflict between those seeking\norganizational rewards for reducing this uncertainty. While the power bases to which these two camps referred\nwere somewhat successful in swaying senior management opinion, no camp was identified as the clear\n\u2018winner\u2019. As such both groups continued to pursue their positions by further trying to identify themselves with\nCSR and convince others within the organization that they should have control over CSR on the basis of their\nlegitimate role within the organization and superior expert knowledge.\nTactics for changing individual power\nWhile the two camps were referring to legitimate and expert power sources in the fight for control over\nCSR, the individuals used a multitude of influence tactics to improve their own power wi t h in the\no rga n i za t i o n . Bot h t he CSR a n d Department 2 manager used similar tact ics to influence the\nperception of others within the organization to help improve their own position of power. The most\ncommon tactics observed were the use of coalition in conjunction with pressure. Both managers referred\nback to their boss as supporting their current CSR activities, and suggested that if CSR was implemented\ndifferently to what their camp indicated was appropriate, it would fail. The reasons given for this imminent\nfailure tended to be around lack of support within the company for those \u2018types\u2019 of CSR initiatives and\ndifficulty accessing scarce company resources. In many cases, both managers tried to disguise their use of\ncoalition and pressure behind rational arguments. For instance, when meeting with individual senior\nmangers to discuss their contributions to the CSR re po r t , b o th the CSR an d the Depa r tmen t 2 manager\n(both present at all meetings) would continually refer back to what their boss and others at higher levels\nwithin the organization had said to them about CSR and the report. These comments were then used to\nencourage agreement from the senior manager in the meeting. If agreement was not forthcoming, then the\nmanagers would comment that if CSR was not approached either from a wider stakeholder perspective\n(Camp 1) or more traditional business perspective (Camp 2), CSR would be unlikely to succeed, thus\nresulting in negative consequences for the business. Some examples of these comments include \u2018well if\nyou don\u2019t know what your suppliers are doing, someone will catch you out\u2019 (TRO1) and \u2018if we can\u2019t link\nCSR back to business profitability we may as not do i t because i t wi l l be a waste of t ime\u2019 (TRO1 1).\nThe other pair of tactics that was observed, although less often, was ingratiation and personal appeal.\nThis combination of tactics was observed more often with the CSR manager, and they were used when\nthere was concern over whether the targeted individual might say no to her request. These two tactics\nwere often used on the researcher to try and pull her in line with either the CSR or Department 2 manager\u2019s\nview of CSR. It is believed that this was done so as to suggest that the external \u2018expert\u2019 was fully within one\ncamp, adding further support to their interpretation of CSR. Rational persuasion, consultation and\nlegitimating were used but infrequently. Neither inspirational appeal nor exchange was observed during\nfield visits.\nOutside of the tactics identified by Yukl and Tracey (1992), both managers indicated that the other\nmanagers involved in CSR (including the department heads) were not as \u2018ethical\u2019 as they were and therefore,\nby virtue of their better ethics should be in contro l of CSR. For ins tance, the CSR manager indicated on\nmany separate occasions that the Department 2\u2019s manager \u2018did not care about CSR\u2019 and was \u2018unethical\nbecause he would do whatever his unethical boss asked of him\u2019 (TRO1) with the implication that somehow\nhis poor personal ethics (according to the CSR manager) meant that he would agree wi th whatever his\nboss said , regardless of what that boss\u2019 opinion was. Meanwhile, the Department 2 manager dedicated\nover 10 min of a 1 h interview to describe his beliefs about morality, showing himself to be a highly moral\nperson.\nTRI1 1: uhm because we are moral beings, and our development as human beings uhm will get no where if you\u2019re not\nmoral, I mean, you know if if I\u2019m if I say there is no moral (code), businesses are not moral institutions, they have no\nmoral fibre ... I wouldn\u2019t say that to my wife, to my children you know so why should I be you know like uhm why\nshould I not care about morals in the business when I care about them with my friends. I care about them if my partner\nis cheating on me, or my children are lying to me or stealing so its basically just saying look ... I\u2019m not gonna lie to\nmy friends and I\u2019m not going to lie to my suppliers or my customers and honesty is a big part of it, honesty uhm you\nknow I mean a lot of this information, but a a lot of a persons information, is due to them being open and honest to\nreceiving information uhm if if you know a person can say oh you know I never knew about that but if they don\u2019t\nmake any efforts to know about it or if they have blocked it in the past or they\u2019ve put up barriers, then they\u2019re not\ngonna know\nThis quote clearly shows TRI1 1 linking his beliefs about \u2018good personal ethics\u2019 to \u2018good organizational ethics\u2019,\ndemonstrating his belief in the overlap between them, and used this to demonstrate his appropriateness\nfor being in control of CSR. He does this by describing how part of being a moral person includes being\nopen to receiving new information about CSR, which was a subtle comparison with the CSR manager who\nhe had indicated previously was not interested in learning more about CSR. He was thus saying that he was more\nmoral because he was open to a broader understanding of CSR.\nThe fact that both of these managers used an \u2018ethical person\u2019 tactic, indicates that both ascribed to the belief\ndescribed in some of the literature that CSR is fundamentally \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 (e.g. Aguilera et al., 2007), and\ntherefore to be responsible for CSR within the organization, they also must have (or be seen to have) an\nappropriate matching ethic. This tactic was used as often as coalition\/pressure, but was also quite subtle. The use\nof this tactic made the st ruggle for CSR more personal , and thus intensified it.\nTaken as a whole, both managers were employing the same type of argument to win power from the other in\ncontrol of CSR: first the other manager\u2019s understanding of CSR is flawed, second that they have more\nsupport within the organization, third that their department head is more powerful and fourth that they are\nthe more ethical individual and therefore will be awarded full control over CSR activities.\nCSR ignored in the struggle over who controls it\nMeanwhile, in the course of struggling for control over CSR activities, the development and implementation\nof CSR strategy was virtually ignored. The CSR manager was focussed on maintaining her job and by\nclaiming CSR as a complex field of inquiry thus requiring expert knowledge, she was trying to maintain the\nperks of going to different countries to meet with industry bodies on CSR. The Department 2 manager wanted to\ngain control over CSR to help minimize it and thus gain the praise of his boss.\nDuring the 11 months I was in contact with the company, virtually no forward movement had been m a de o n\nCS R w i t h i n t he o r ga n i z a t i o n : t h e Department 2 manager finished the four pages for the annual report\nto appease the investor, and the CSR manager attended three separate industry events, all focussed on\nrefining the industry supplier assessment criteria, while continuing to work on both the recycling policy and\nenergy efficiency initiative for the two head office sites. Clearly, the desire to improve their own personal\npower within the organization was significantly strong to keep both managers (and their respective\ndepartments) involved in the fight over control of CSR. However, this very focus on the power struggle\nbecame an impediment to the development and implementation of CSR within the organization.\nTh e pa r a do x of po w e r i n C S R\nIn recognizing the rewards associated with controlling CSR, and in their shared disinterest in pursing a CSR\nagenda, both camps focussed on the conflict and not on the activities surrounding it. Thus, while they both\nused power sources and influence tactics to reduce the perception of uncertainty around CSR within the\norganization and with the investor, they were not in fact using any resources to improve actual CSR\nengagement. In other words, as it became more powerful, work on CSR planning and initiatives virtually\nceased while actors struggled to position themselves more favourably within the organization based on the\nnew opportunities presented by CSR. And, there is the paradox \u2013 as CSR becomes more powerful, the rewards that\nthis power creates within organizations may in fact subvert efforts to move CSR forward, and therefore subvert\nthe benefi ts to stakeholders that this power is assumed to provide.\nCSR is therefore distinct in that it is highly susceptible to the opportunistic behaviour of actors and subversion of\nresulting societal benefits due to the high uncertainty that surrounds it. As resource dependence theory suggests,\norganizations employ different strategies and tactics to reduce uncertainty and constraint within their environments.\nThis is done by accessing key resources (such as individuals or legitimacy) that help to absorb the constraint,\nproviding the organization with increased discretion and control over its activities (e.g. Casciaro and Piskorski,\n2005; Hillman et al., 2000). However, the complexity and uncertainty surrounding a vast range of CSR issues\nmeans that identifying the appropriate resources to \u2018absorb\u2019 CSR is difficult. Few individuals have the knowledge\nand networks to effectively create the interdependencies between the organization and external groups around\npertinent CSR issues. They therefore have limited expertise and experience, but also fewer channels for\ncommunication, aids in obtaining support or external credibility (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978\/2003) to deal with\nthese external CSR factors. This in tandem with the complexity of CSR means that it is quite easy for individuals\nwith little expertise and\/or interest to manipulate and control CSR activities without the organization realizing\nthe consequences until much later in the process. Therefore, CSR acts as a constraint at the organizational level,\ncompelling organizations to engage in it due to changes in their operating environment, but as an\nopportunity at the individual level, where actors (some with little personal interest) may use CSR as a tool for\nimproving their own position.\nThus, constraint absorption (Casciaro and Piskorski, 2005) is not achieved in the long-term as the constraints\nimposed by CSR still exist , but the opportunistic behaviour of actors within the organization ignore or do\nnot employ their resources in responding to these constraints, putting the organization at further risk.\nOpportunities for the business (Bloodgood and Morrow, 2003) resulting from CSR are also virtually ignored,\nreducing the likelihood that CSR will be seen as having traditional (and non-traditional) business benefits,\nand therefore less likely to have support at senior levels within the organization. Looking back to the\nthree more common methods of reducing uncertainty, creating interdependencies, mergers and acquisitions and\nemploying individuals with key resources, we see that these methods are problematic with regard to CSR.\nSince merging or acquiring new \u2018CSR focussed\u2019 companies is a very expensive option and is not guaranteed\nto provide access to key resources in such a complex area (i.e. as was the case with L\u2019Oreal\u2019s purchase of\nthe Body Shop), and the creation of interdependencies relies heavily on indiv i d u a l a c t o r s t o i d e n t i f y\na n d c r e a t e t h e s e relationships, the problems created by opportunistic behaviour are significant. And, this\nbehaviour is exacerbated by the fact that CSR does not have its own natural place within business due to the\nfact that it cuts across all business functions. Without this natural placement, with high levels of uncertainty\ndue to its complexity, and with the potential to attract opportunistically motivated individuals due to the\nopportunities CSR creates at an individual level, it is susceptible to perversion or corruption from those who\nseek to control it. Also, the struggle for control is heightened due to the fact that personal ethics of CSR\nprofessionals are thought to be relevant to their ability to be in control of CSR, and are thus used to personalize\nand therefore intensify the struggle, whether intentional or not.\nTherefore, CSR must be carefully managed to ensure that its formation within the organization reflects an\nunderstanding of the resources needed to engage effectively across a range of issues. For instance, by ensuring\nsenior management responsibility for CSR, authority and access given to the person functionally responsible for\nCSR, and appropriate hiring competencies used to fill the CSR role, it is possible to significantly limit the potential\nfor CSR to be used as a tool for personal gain within organizations.\nConclusion\nThis article suggests that there is a paradox of power in CSR. The positive benefits associated with\nincreased power of CSR that are assumed by the literature may in fact not exist in some circumstances.\nIn fact, an increase in the power of CSR may be an impediment to the effective development and\nimplementation of it in some organizations. Thus, this increase in power may in fact lead to opportunistic\nbehaviour, which may result in the subversion of CSR and its benefits for stakeholders. CSR may be particularly\nsusceptible to this type of behaviour due to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding it, and therefore the\ndifficulty in identifying appropriate resources for responding to it. This struggle is intensified due to the\npersonalization of the struggle as individual ethics become a part of the debate.\nThis article adds to the CSR literature in four distinct ways: 1, by illustrating how CSR can provide\nopportunities for individual actors to improve their own positions within an organization; 2, in illustrating\nthat those fighting for power often do so at the expense of CSR development and implementation efforts; 3,\nthe increasing power of CSR may be an impediment in that it increasingly attracts individuals who are more\ninterested in increasing thei r own power rather than developing and implementing effective CSR\nstrategy and 4, that companies must be aware of and mitigate potential conflicts resulting from a competition\nfor power surrounding control of CSR.\nThis article has demonstrated the significant influence that power can have over CSR development and\nimplementation, highlighting the paradoxical power of CSR and thus the need for further research into the\nlink between CSR, power and implementation.\nNotes\n1 For the purpose of this art icle, no conceptual or operational definition of CSR has been provided because the\nmost appropriate definit ion of CSR within this case is the case company\u2019s definition which is highlighted in later\nsections of this article.\n2 This information was collected during the course of interviews with senior and mid-management-level employees\nand informal conversations with a range of management over the course of the case research.\nReferences\nAbel, C.: 2005, \u2018Beyond the Mainstream: Foucault, Power and Organization Theory\u2019, International Journal of\nOrganization Theory and Behavior 8(4), 495\u2013519.\nAdam, A. and D.
