Introduction. It is known that bacteriophage infection can be a signi\ufb01-\ncant mechanism of mortality in marine prokaryotes (Bergh et al. [6], Proctor and\nFuhrman [16]). These mortality mechanisms are critical in understanding the marine\nproduction processes. The constituents released by cell lysis can be an important\npathway of nutrient recycling. This has direct bearing on issues such as global warm-\ning and topics of geochemical cycles. Viral infection also has direct implications for\ngenetic exchange in the sea (Lenski and Levin [14], Bohannan and Lenski [7]).\nAlthough we do not yet have a good understanding of the temporal or spatial\nscales at which host-virus encounters occur, it is clear that viral mortality must be\nexplicitly considered in most models of the marine system. A case in point, recent\nexperimental work suggests that the contamination of algal cells by viruses can serve\nas a regulatory mechanism in its bloom dynamics. Beltrami and Carroll [1] formulated\na simple trophic model including virus-induced mortality. Their model succeeded in\nmimicking the actual algal bloom patterns of several species.\nOur main interest in this paper is to explore how viral mortality a\ufb00ects both\nthe temporal and spatial dynamics of marine bacteria and cyanobacteria. Recently,\nBeretta and Kuang [4] formulated and carried out a detailed study of the temporal\nviral-bacteria model\ndS\ndt\n= \u03b1S(t)\n(\n1\u2212 S(t) + I(t)C\n)\n\u2212KS(t)P (t),\ndI\ndt\n= \u2212\u00b5iI(t) +KS(t)P (t)\u2212 e\u2212\u00b5iTKS(t\u2212 T )P (t\u2212 T ),\ndP\ndt\n= \u03b2 \u2212 \u00b5pP (t)\u2212KS(t)P (t) + be\u2212\u00b5iTKS(t\u2212 T )P (t\u2212 T ).\n(1.1)\n\u2217Received by the editors October 24, 2003; accepted for publication (in revised form) May 17,\n2004; published electronically January 5, 2005.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/65-2\/43661.html\n\u2020Corresponding author.

The research of this author was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0077790.\n550\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 551\nThis system of delay di\ufb00erential equations models a population of marine bacteria in\nwhich the individuals are subject to infection by viruses, also known as bacteriophages.\nPrior to that, these authors (Beretta and Kuang [2]) modeled and studied the same\nprocess by a set of nonlinear ordinary di\ufb00erential equations, and Carletti [10] has\nstudied the stochastic extension of that model. In system (1.1), S is the density\n(i.e., number of bacteria per liter) of susceptible bacteria, I is the density of infected\nbacteria, and P is the density (number of viruses per liter) of viruses (phages). Viruses\nP attack the susceptible bacteria S, and a bacterium becomes infected I when a virus\nsuccessfully injects itself through the bacterial membrane. The virus then starts\nreplicating inside the bacterium, and then all the bacterium\u2019s resources are directed\nto replication of the virus. The infected bacterium does not replicate itself by division;\nonly susceptible bacteria are capable of doing so. After a latency time T , an infected\nbacterium will die by lysis; i.e., the bacterium explodes releasing b copies (b > 1) of\nthe virus into the solution, which are then free to attack other susceptible bacteria.\nAn infected bacterium may die other than by viral lysis; we allow for this by the term\n\u2212\u00b5iI(t). The di\ufb00erential equation for I(t) is derived from the fact that I(t) is given\nby\nI(t) =\n\u222b T\n0\ne\u2212\u00b5i\u03c4KS(t\u2212 \u03c4)P (t\u2212 \u03c4) d\u03c4,(1.2)\nwhich expresses the fact that the number of recruits into the infected class between\ntimes t \u2212 (\u03c4 + d\u03c4) and t \u2212 \u03c4 is KS(t \u2212 \u03c4)P (t \u2212 \u03c4) d\u03c4 , the number of these still alive\nat time t is obtained by multiplying by e\u2212\u00b5i\u03c4 , and then the integral totals up the\ncontributions from all relevant previous times, i.e., up to T time units ago.\nIn the virus equation, the third equation of (1.1), all mortalities of viruses are\naccounted for by the term \u2212\u00b5pP (t). The \u03b2 term, where \u03b2 > 0, models a constant\nin\ufb02ow of phages from outside the system. In the absence of viruses the bacteria grow\nlogistically. The rate of infection is given by the law of mass action to be KS(t)P (t).\nBeretta and Kuang [4] assumed that infected bacteria still compete with suscep-\ntible bacteria for common resources. This is represented by the \u2212(S + I)\/C term in\nthe \ufb01rst equation of (1.1). This is clearly a disputed subject. For example, a model\nby Campbell [8] consists of the following equations:\ndS(t)\ndt\n= \u03b1S(t)\n(\n1\u2212 S(t)\nC\n)\n\u2212KS(t)P (t),(1.3)\ndP (t)\ndt\n= bKS(t\u2212 T )P (t\u2212 T )\u2212 \u00b5pP (t)\u2212KS(t)P (t),\nwhere\nI(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212T\nKS(\u03b8)P (\u03b8)d\u03b8.(1.4)\nClearly, in (1.3) the competition for common resources and additional mortality rate\nendured by infected bacteria is neglected. The equations (1.3), (1.4) can be obtained\nfrom (1.1) by setting \u03b2 = 0, \u00b5i = 0. Extensions of the above Campbell model can\nbe found in Beretta, Carletti, and Solimano [3] (taking into account environmental\n\ufb02uctuations) and Carletti [9] (replacing b by be\u2212\u00b5iT ).\nIn the present paper, like the model of Campbell [8], we assume that once a\nbacterium becomes infected by a virus, it no longer competes with susceptibles for\n552 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\nresources. We will allow the possibility of a density dependent mortality term in the\nphage equation. In Beretta and Kuang [4], and also in the present paper, it is assumed\nthat T and b are constant and the same for the whole population. Modi\ufb01cations of\nthis assumption (e.g., replacing the constant incubation time T by a distribution of\nincubation times modeled using a probability density function) are the subject of\nfurther work presently in progress.\nIn the next section, we will present our delay model of bacteriophage infection\nand a simple preliminary result on the positivity of its solutions. This is followed by\na short section on the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. The analysis\nof endemic equilibrium is highly nontrivial and we provide only generic conditions\nfor its stability switch. To complement this analytic work, we present some carefully\ndesigned and data-based simulation results. We then proceed to formulate and study\na delay reaction-di\ufb00usion model of the spread of bacteriophage infection. The paper\nends with a discussion.\n2. Preliminaries. Most of our e\ufb00ort will be devoted to understanding the sys-\ntem\nS\u2032(t) = \u03b1S(t)\n(\n1\u2212 S(t)\u03b3\n)\n\u2212KS(t)P (t),\nP \u2032(t) = \u2212\u00b5pP (t)\u2212mP 2(t)\u2212KS(t)P (t) + bKe\u2212\u00b5iTS(t\u2212 T )P (t\u2212 T ),\n(2.1)\nand with a reaction-di\ufb00usion version of (2.1). The initial conditions for (2.1) are\nS(s) = S0(s) \u2265 0, s \u2208 [\u2212T, 0], with S0(0) > 0,\nP (s) = P 0(s) \u2265 0, s \u2208 [\u2212T, 0], with P 0(0) > 0,(2.2)\nwhere S0 and P 0 are prescribed continuous functions. Our system (2.1) di\ufb00ers from\nthat studied in [4] in three respects: (i) we do not have an in\ufb02ow of phages from\noutside the system, (ii) we allow the possibility of a density dependent mortality term\n(the term \u2212mP 2 in (2.1)), and (iii) we assume that an infected bacterium no longer\ncompetes with the susceptibles for resources. The latter assumption means that we\ndo not need the di\ufb00erential equation for I(t) for the analysis (though I(t) is still given\nby (1.2)). An additional di\ufb00erence is that in the present paper we shall consider the\ne\ufb00ects of including di\ufb00usion to model the motion of the phages and bacteria.\nIf we had P 0(s) \u2261 0 on [\u2212T, 0], the method of steps would immediately yield\nP (t) = 0 for all t > 0. The dynamics of S(t) would then be governed by the logistic\nequation. Similarly, if S0(s) \u2261 0, then clearly S(t) remains zero for all t > 0 and\nthus P (t)\u21920 as t\u2192\u221e. These trivial cases are removed from consideration by the\nassumptions in (2.2).\nProposition 1. Solutions of (2.1), (2.2) satisfy S(t) > 0, P (t) > 0 for all t > 0.\nProof. The equation for S(t) in (2.1) contains a factor of S(t) and therefore\npositivity for S(t) follows by the standard argument. For P (t), note that on t \u2208 [0, T ]\nwe have P \u2032(t) \u2265 \u2212\u00b5pP (t) \u2212 mP 2(t) \u2212 KS(t)P (t) so that P (t) \u2265 P\u02dc (t), where P\u02dc is\nthe solution of P\u02dc \u2032(t) = \u2212\u00b5pP\u02dc (t) \u2212mP\u02dc 2(t) \u2212KS(t)P\u02dc (t) satisfying P\u02dc (0) = P (0) > 0.\nClearly P\u02dc (t) > 0 for all t > 0, and so we conclude that P (t) > 0 for all t > 0. The\nproof is complete.\n3. Equilibria and their stability. The equilibria of (2.1) are (S, P ) = (0, 0),\nthe disease-free equilibrium (\u03b3, 0), and possibly an endemic equilibrium\n(S\u2217, P \u2217) :=\n(\nm\u03b3\u03b1+K\u03b3\u00b5p\nm\u03b1+K2\u03b3(be\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 1) ,\n\u03b1\u03b3K(be\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 1)\u2212 \u03b1\u00b5p\nm\u03b1+K2\u03b3(be\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 1)\n)\n.(3.1)\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 553\nThe latter is ecologically relevant if and only if\nbe\u2212\u00b5iT > 1 +\n\u00b5p\n\u03b3K\n,(3.2)\nwhich, of course, can only possibly hold for T up to a \ufb01nite value. As long as (3.2)\nholds, there is an endemic equilibrium. Note that as m\u2192\u221e the endemic equilibrium\napproaches the disease-free equilibrium (\u03b3, 0).\nWe shall \ufb01rst prove that, if condition (3.2) does not hold, then any positive\nsolution approaches the disease-free equilibrium (\u03b3, 0).\nTheorem 1. Assume that\nbe\u2212\u00b5iT \u2264 1 + \u00b5p\n\u03b3K\n.\nThen any solution of (2.1), (2.2) satis\ufb01es\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e(S(t), P (t)) = (\u03b3, 0).\nProof. Consider the positive de\ufb01nite functional\nV = S \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 ln S\n\u03b3\n+\n\u03b3K\n\u00b5p\nP +\nb\u03b3K2\n\u00b5p\ne\u2212\u00b5iT\n\u222b t\nt\u2212T\nS(s)P (s) ds.\nDi\ufb00erentiating along solutions of (2.1) yields\nV \u2032 = \u2212\u03b1\n\u03b3\n(S \u2212 \u03b3)2 \u2212 \u03b3mK\n\u00b5p\nP 2 +K\n(\nb\u03b3K\n\u00b5p\ne\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 \u03b3K\n\u00b5p\n\u2212 1\n)\nSP\n\u2264 \u2212\u03b1\n\u03b3\n(S \u2212 \u03b3)2.\nThus\nV (t) +\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\n\u222b t\n0\n(S(s)\u2212 \u03b3)2 ds \u2264 V (0),\nand, letting t\u2192\u221e, we conclude that |S(t) \u2212 \u03b3| \u2208 L2(0,\u221e) so that S(t)\u2192\u03b3 as t\u2192\u221e.\nThe di\ufb00erential equations (2.1) then yield P (t)\u21920. The proof is complete.\n3.1. The endemic equilibrium: Linearized analysis. Let us investigate the\nendemic equilibrium (S\u2217, P \u2217) given by (3.1). In this subsection we shall assume, of\ncourse, that (3.2) holds, so that the equilibrium is feasible. The linearized analysis\nabout the endemic equilibrium is algebraically quite complicated. The main reason\nfor this is that the delay T appears not only in the S(t \u2212 T )P (t \u2212 T ) term in the\nsecond equation of (2.1), but also in the factor e\u2212\u00b5iT in front of that term. The\npaper by Wolkowicz, Xia, and Wu [20] shows how such additional factors involving\ntime delay can appear in distributed delay equations. Surprisingly, this represents\na signi\ufb01cant complication and prevents us from analytically computing the precise\nparameter regimes in which the endemic equilibrium can change stability as the delay\nT is increased, or the actual values of T when stability switches occur. Note further\nthat the equilibrium itself depends on T and exists only for T up to a \ufb01nite value.\nThis renders many of the existing stability switch methods (see Kuang [12]) powerless.\nHowever, a method has recently been developed by Beretta and Kuang [5] to address\nthe problem of computing stability switches for delay equations which do not lend\n554 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\nthemselves to classical methods because of these complications. We shall use this\nmethod in this section.\nTo linearize about (S\u2217, P \u2217) we set S = S\u2217 + S\u02dc and P = P \u2217 + P\u02dc . Ignoring higher\norder terms in S\u02dc, P\u02dc gives us the linearized system\nS\u02dc\u2032(t) = \u2212\u03b1\u03b3 S\u2217S\u02dc(t)\u2212KS\u2217P\u02dc (t),\nP\u02dc \u2032(t) = \u2212KP \u2217S\u02dc(t)\u2212 (\u00b5p + 2mP \u2217 +KS\u2217)P\u02dc (t)\n+ bKe\u2212\u00b5iT (P \u2217S\u02dc(t\u2212 T ) + S\u2217P\u02dc (t\u2212 T )).\n(3.3)\nWe shall \ufb01nd it convenient to introduce the parameter\n\u03c1T =\n\u03b3K\n\u00b5p\n(be\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 1).(3.4)\nThen the endemic equilibrium (S\u2217, P \u2217) exists if and only if\n\u03c1T > 1.\nIn terms of \u03c1T ,\n(S\u2217, P \u2217) =\n(\n\u03b3(m\u03b1+K\u00b5p)\nm\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T\n,\n\u03b1\u00b5p(\u03c1T \u2212 1)\nm\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T\n)\n.\nNontrivial solutions of the linearized system of the form (S\u02dc(t), P\u02dc (t)) = e\u03bbt(c1, c2) exist\nif and only if\nD(\u03bb;T ) = 0,\nwhere\nD(\u03bb;T ) = \u03bb2 + a(T )\u03bb+ b(T )\u03bbe\u2212\u03bbT + c(T ) + d(T )e\u2212\u03bbT(3.5)\nand\na(T ) =\n\u03b1(m\u03b1+K\u00b5p) +m\u03b1(K\u03b3 + 2\u00b5p\u03c1T \u2212 \u00b5p) +K\u00b5p(K\u03b3 + \u00b5p\u03c1T )\nm\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T\n,(3.6)\nb(T ) = \u2212b\u03b3Ke\n\u2212\u00b5iT (m\u03b1+K\u00b5p)\nm\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T\n,(3.7)\nc(T ) =\n\u03b1(m\u03b1+K\u00b5p) {m\u03b1(K\u03b3 + (2\u03c1T \u2212 1)\u00b5p) +K\u00b5p(\u00b5p\u03c1T + (2\u2212 \u03c1T )K\u03b3)}\n(m\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T )2\n,(3.8)\nd(T ) =\nbK\u03b3\u03b1e\u2212\u00b5iT (m\u03b1+K\u00b5p) {K\u00b5p(\u03c1T \u2212 2)\u2212m\u03b1}\n(m\u03b1+K\u00b5p\u03c1T )2\n.(3.9)\nKeeping in mind that b > 1, it is straightforward to see that when T = 0 the equilib-\nrium (S\u2217, P \u2217), if feasible, is linearly stable. This is because when T = 0, (3.5) becomes\na quadratic in \u03bb, and it is easy to see that a(0) + b(0) > 0 and c(0) + d(0) > 0. The\nquestion is whether the equilibrium can undergo any stability switch as T is increased,\nremembering that the equilibrium is only feasible up to a \ufb01nite value of T . To identify\na stability switch we seek solutions of the characteristic equation D(\u03bb;T ) = 0 of the\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 555\nform \u03bb = \u00b1i\u03c9, with \u03c9 a real positive number. We \ufb01nd that it is necessary for \u03c9 to\nsatisfy\n\u03c94 + (a2(T )\u2212 2c(T )\u2212 b2(T ))\u03c92 + c2(T )\u2212 d2(T ) = 0.(3.10)\nHowever, the existence for a particular T of a real root \u03c9(T ) of (3.10) does not in\nitself imply that a stability switch occurs at that value of T , since T also has to\nsatisfy (3.11) and (3.12) below. Nonetheless, certain general analytical conclusions\ncan be drawn in spite of the algebra. Straightforward but tedious computations show\nthat, for any parameter values consistent with \u03c1T > 1 (i.e., with existence of the\nendemic equilibrium (S\u2217, P \u2217)), we have\na2(T )\u2212 2c(T )\u2212 b2(T ) > 0.\nIn light of this fact, and assuming that (S\u2217, P \u2217) is feasible when T = 0, certain\nconclusions follow.\n(i) A stability switch cannot occur in an interval of T throughout which c2(T ) >\nd2(T ).\n(ii) If there are values of T with c2(T ) < d2(T ), then a stability switch may occur\nas T is varied. Pairs of eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis as T passes through\ncertain critical values. The critical values of T and the corresponding purely imaginary\neigenvalues \u00b1i\u03c9(T ), \u03c9(T ) > 0, are given implicitly by\nsin(\u03c9(T )T ) =\nb(T )\u03c9(T )(\u03c92(T )\u2212 c(T )) + \u03c9(T )a(T )d(T )\n\u03c92(T )b2(T ) + d2(T )\n,(3.11)\ncos(\u03c9(T )T ) =\nd(T )(\u03c92(T )\u2212 c(T ))\u2212 \u03c92(T )a(T )b(T )\n\u03c92(T )b2(T ) + d2(T )\n,(3.12)\n\u03c92(T ) =\n1\n2\n(\n\u2212 a2(T ) + 2c(T ) + b2(T )(3.13)\n+\n\u221a\na4(T )\u2212 4a2(T )c(T )\u2212 2a2(T )b2(T ) + 4c(T )b2(T ) + b4(T ) + 4d2(T )\n)\n,\nwhere a(T ), b(T ), c(T ), and d(T ) are given by (3.6), (3.7), (3.8), and (3.9) above. It\nis impossible to solve these equations for T explicitly, so we shall use the procedure\ndescribed in Beretta and Kuang [5]. According to this procedure, we de\ufb01ne \u03b8(T ) \u2208\n[0, 2\u03c0) such that sin \u03b8(T ) and cos \u03b8(T ) are given by the right-hand sides of (3.11)\nand (3.12), respectively, with \u03c9(T ) given by (3.13). This de\ufb01nes \u03b8(T ) in a form\nsuitable for numerical evaluation using standard software. Then T is given (still\nimplicitly) by\nT =\n\u03b8(T ) + 2n\u03c0\n\u03c9(T )\n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\nand the idea is to identify the roots of this equation for various n, i.e., to solve\nnumerically the equation Sn(T ) = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, where\nSn(T ) = T \u2212\n(\n\u03b8(T ) + 2n\u03c0\n\u03c9(T )\n)\n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .(3.14)\n556 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\nAccurate plots of these functions Sn(T ) quickly reveal whether stability switches can\noccur or not, but one must remember to keep track of the feasibility of the equilibrium\n(S\u2217, P \u2217) since it disappears completely (by coalescing with the disease-free equilibrium\n(\u03b3, 0)) at a \ufb01nite value of the delay T .\nBy reference to (i) above, it is possible to obtain su\ufb03cient and easily veri\ufb01able\nconditions for the equilibrium (S\u2217, P \u2217) to remain locally stable. Indeed, the condition\nc2(T ) > d2(T ) amounts to\n(3.15)\nm2\n{\n\u03b12(K\u03b3 + (2\u03c1T \u2212 1)\u00b5p)2 \u2212 \u03b12b2K2\u03b32e\u22122\u00b5iT\n}\n+ 2\u03b1K\u00b5pm\n{\n(K\u03b3 + (2\u03c1T \u2212 1)\u00b5p)(\u00b5p\u03c1T + (2\u2212 \u03c1T )K\u03b3) + (\u03c1T \u2212 2)b2K2\u03b32e\u22122\u00b5iT\n}\n+K2\u00b52p(\u00b5p\u03c1T + (2\u2212 \u03c1T )K\u03b3)2 \u2212K2\u00b52p(\u03c1T \u2212 2)2b2K2\u03b32e\u22122\u00b5iT > 0.\nThus, if (3.15) holds, then (S\u2217, P \u2217), if feasible, is locally stable. The coe\ufb03cient of m2\nin (3.15) is automatically positive if \u03c1T > 1 (the condition for feasibility of (S\n\u2217, P \u2217)),\nand therefore one parameter regime in which (3.15) is satis\ufb01ed is that the parameter\nm be large.\nFor the convenience of comparison and computation, we perform the same di-\nmensionless analysis as was carried out in Beretta and Kuang [4]. We choose the\ndimensionless time as \u03c4 = K\u03b3t. Note that one unit of the dimensionless time scale,\ni.e., \u03c4 = 1, corresponds to t\u03c4 = (1\/K\u03b3) in the original time unit. We also need the\ndimensionless variables\ns =\nS\n\u03b3\n, p =\nP\n\u03b3\n.\nBelow are the dimensionless parameters:\na =\n\u03b1\nK\u03b3\n, mp =\n\u00b5p\nK\u03b3\n, mi =\n\u00b5i\nK\u03b3\n, mq =\nm\nK\n.\nEquations (2.1) have the dimensionless form\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\nds(\u03c4)\nd\u03c4\n= as(\u03c4)\u2212 as2(\u03c4)\u2212 s(\u03c4)p(\u03c4),\ndp(\u03c4)\nd\u03c4\n= \u2212mpp(\u03c4)\u2212mqp2(\u03c4)\u2212 s(\u03c4)p(\u03c4) + be\u2212miT\u03c4 s(\u03c4 \u2212 T\u03c4 )p(\u03c4 \u2212 T\u03c4 ).\n(3.16)\nThe values for the dimensionless parameters and the dimensionless time scale are\ntaken from the model of Beretta and Kuang [4] (the original parameter estimates are\ndue to Okubo). They are\na = 10, mp = 14.925,(3.17)\nwith t\u03c4 = (1\/K\u03b3) = 7.4627 days and an average latency time T \u0007 0.303 days. We\nhave no estimates for mi = (\u00b5i\/K\u03b3), but it seems reasonable to assume it is smaller\nthan m (since the main cause of mortality is the lysis of infected cells). We assume\nmi \u0007 0.1mp. In addition, we do not have an estimate on mq. In the following\ncomputational work, we assume that mq \u0007 0.1, a value close to zero. Figure 1 is the\nresult of an application of the stability switch theory of Beretta and Kuang [5] for\nthis set of parameters (except that we vary the latency period).\nFigure 2 provides simulation results for the above set of parameters with four rep-\nresentative values of latency periods.

GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\n4. Di\ufb00usive models. In this section we propose some reaction-di\ufb00usion exten-\nsions of system (2.1). The main issues here are (i) what types of di\ufb00usion are appro-\npriate, and (ii) derivation of the time-delay terms for the case when there is di\ufb00usion.\nThe latter point is important because infectives can move during the period between\ninfection and lysis, so that when an infective dies by lysis it will release the b copies\nof the virus into the water at a di\ufb00erent location from where it originally became\ninfected. We shall show how this can be accounted for in the modeling by including\ntime and age as independent variables and using an age-structured model approach.\nThe approach described here has also been used by many other investigators (see,\ne.g., Smith [17], So, Wu, and Zou [18], and Gourley and So [11]).\nFor the simplest case of Fickian di\ufb00usion, and working on an in\ufb01nite one-dimensional\ndomain \u2212\u221e < x <\u221e, system (2.1) becomes\n\u2202S(x, t)\n\u2202t\n= Ds\n\u22022S(x, t)\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03b1S(x, t)\n(\n1\u2212 S(x, t)\u03b3\n)\n\u2212KS(x, t)P (x, t),\n\u2202P (x, t)\n\u2202t\n= Dp\n\u22022P (x, t)\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u00b5pP (x, t)\u2212mP 2(x, t)\u2212KS(x, t)P (x, t)\n+ b\u00d7 {rate of death of infectives by lysis},\n(4.1)\nwhere Ds and Dp are the di\ufb00usivities of the susceptibles and the phages. The last\nterm in the P equation re\ufb02ects the fact that each time an infective dies by lysis, it\nreleases b copies of the virus, and we must now compute an expression for the term\nin curly brackets. As a \ufb01rst step in doing so, we shall indicate how to compute the\ndensity I(x, t) of infectives at (x, t). This will be achieved by using a standard age-\nstructured model approach. Let i(x, t, a) be the density of infectives at (x, t) of age\na. We assume that i satis\ufb01es the von Foerster-type equation\n\u2202i\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202i\n\u2202a\n= Di\n\u22022i\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u00b5ii,(4.2)\nwhere Di is the di\ufb00usivity of the infectives. The age of an infective will be measured\nfrom its time of infection so that, by the law of mass action,\ni(x, t, 0) = KS(x, t)P (x, t).(4.3)\nWe want to solve (4.2) subject to (4.3) to obtain i(x, t, a). The total density of\ninfectives at (x, t) will then be obtained by totaling all those of \u201cage\u201d less than T\n(since older ones will have died by lysis); thus\nI(x, t) =\n\u222b T\n0\ni(x, t, a) da.(4.4)\nExpression (4.4) can then be used to \ufb01nd the rate of death of infectives by lysis which\nis required for model (4.1).\nLet\nir(x, a) = i(x, a+ r, a).\nThen\n\u2202ir\n\u2202a\n=\n[\n\u2202i\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202i\n\u2202a\n]\nt=a+r\n=\n[\nDi\n\u22022i\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u00b5ii\n]\nt=a+r\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 559\nso that\n\u2202ir\n\u2202a\n= Di\n\u22022ir\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u00b5iir.(4.5)\nApplying the Fourier transform\ni\u0302r(s, a) = F{ir(x, a); x\u2192s} =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nir(x, a)e\u2212isx dx\nto (4.5) gives\n\u2202i\u0302r(s, a)\n\u2202a\n= \u2212(Dis2 + \u00b5i)i\u0302r(s, a),\nthe solution of which is\ni\u0302r(s, a) = i\u0302r(s, 0)e\u2212(Dis\n2+\u00b5i) a\n= F {KS(x, r)P (x, r); x\u2192s}e\u2212(Dis2+\u00b5i) a\n= F {KS(x, r)P (x, r); x\u2192s}F\n{\ne\u2212\u00b5ia\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Dia\ne\u2212x\n2\/4Dia; x\u2192s\n}\nsince\ni\u0302r(s, 0) = F {i(x, r, 0); x\u2192s} = F {KS(x, r)P (x, r); x\u2192s}\nand\ne\u2212(Dis\n2+\u00b5i) a = F\n{\ne\u2212\u00b5ia\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Dia\ne\u2212x\n2\/4Dia; x\u2192s\n}\n.\nBy the convolution theorem for Fourier transforms,\ni(x, a+ r, a) = ir(x, a) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u00b5ia\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Dia\ne\u2212(x\u2212y)\n2\/4DiaKS(y, r)P (y, r) dy.\nHence\ni(x, t, a) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u00b5ia\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Dia\ne\u2212(x\u2212y)\n2\/4DiaKS(y, t\u2212 a)P (y, t\u2212 a) dy,\nand so\nI(x, t) =\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u00b5ia\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Dia\ne\u2212(x\u2212y)\n2\/4DiaKS(y, t\u2212 a)P (y, t\u2212 a) dy da\nor, after the substitution a = t\u2212 \u03c4 ,\nI(x, t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212T\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u00b5i(t\u2212\u03c4)\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0Di(t\u2212 \u03c4)\ne\u2212(x\u2212y)\n2\/4Di(t\u2212\u03c4)KS(y, \u03c4)P (y, \u03c4) dy d\u03c4.\nFrom this, we see that I(x, t) obeys\n\u2202I(x, t)\n\u2202t\n= Di\n\u22022I(x, t)\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u00b5iI(x, t) +KS(x, t)P (x, t)\n\u2212Ke\u2212\u00b5iT\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212(x\u2212y)\n2\/4DiT\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0DiT\nS(y, t\u2212 T )P (y, t\u2212 T ) dy,\n560 STEPHEN A.

Like (2.1),\nsystem (4.6) does not involve the infectives I(x, t) directly, but it does involve the pa-\nrameter Di which measures their di\ufb00usivity.\nSystem (4.6) is to be solved on the domain \u2212\u221e < x < \u221e. Reaction-di\ufb00usion\nsystems with delay are quite di\ufb03cult to study, and in this paper we will not attempt a\nsystematic study of all the dynamics of (4.6). It is of interest to investigate what (4.6)\ntells us about the spatial spread of a virus infection in a population of bacteria.\nMathematically, it is therefore reasonable to look for traveling wave solutions of (4.6)\nconnecting the disease-free equilibrium (\u03b3, 0) with the endemic equilibrium (S\u2217, P \u2217)\ngiven by (3.1), assuming (3.2) holds so that an endemic equilibrium exists. A traveling\nfront solution connecting these equilibria can model an invasion by the virus into the\ndomain.\nA traveling wave solution is one that travels at a constant speed c without chang-\ning shape. Mathematically, it is a solution that depends on x and t through the single\nvariable z = x+ ct, with c \u2265 0 without loss of generality (this gives a leftward moving\nwave). In terms of the variable z, system (4.6) becomes\nc S\u2032(z) = DsS\u2032\u2032(z) + \u03b1S(z)\n(\n1\u2212 S(z)\u03b3\n)\n\u2212KS(z)P (z),\nc P \u2032(z) = DpP \u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u00b5pP (z)\u2212mP 2(z)\u2212KS(z)P (z)\n+ bKe\u2212\u00b5iT\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212y\n2\/4DiT\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0DiT\nS(z \u2212 cT \u2212 y)P (z \u2212 cT \u2212 y) dy,\n(4.7)\nwhere prime denotes di\ufb00erentiation with respect to z, and we need to solve (4.7) for\nS(z) and P (z) subject to\n(S, P )(\u2212\u221e) = (\u03b3, 0) and (S, P )(+\u221e) = (S\u2217, P \u2217).(4.8)\nSystem (4.7), (4.8) remains a di\ufb03cult mathematical problem, and we have not been\nable to establish the existence of a solution, even with the most recently developed\nmethods for proving existence of traveling front solutions of delay reaction-di\ufb00usion\nsystems such as those of Wu and Zou [21]. We shall therefore assume that such a\nsolution exists and concentrate on \ufb01nding out as much as possible about the speed\nc at which the virus infection spreads through the spatial domain. On the further\nassumption that the infection spreads at the minimum speed consistent with having\nan ecologically realistic solution satisfying S(z), P (z) \u2265 0 for all z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e), we\nshall formally calculate this minimum speed by examining the situation as z\u2192\u2212\u221e,\nwhere P (z)\u21920, and obtaining conditions on c which are necessary for the convergence\nof P (z) to 0 to be nonoscillatory. Linearizing as z\u2192\u2212\u221e, when P\u21920 and S\u2192\u03b3, the\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 561\nsecond equation of (4.7) becomes, approximately,\nc P \u2032(z) = DpP \u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u00b5pP (z)\u2212 \u03b3KP (z) + b\u03b3Ke\u2212\u00b5iT\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212y\n2\/4DiT\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0DiT\nP (z \u2212 cT \u2212 y) dy\nand has solutions of the form P (z) = exp(\u03bbz) whenever \u03bb satis\ufb01es\nc\u03bb\u2212Dp\u03bb2 + \u00b5p + \u03b3K = b\u03b3Ke\u2212\u00b5iT e\u2212\u03bbcT e\u03bb2DiT .(4.9)\nSince this analysis is for z\u2192\u2212\u221e, it is necessary that (4.9) have at least one real positive\nroot if P (z) is to approach 0 in a nonoscillatory manner. Whether (4.9) has real\npositive roots or not depends on the value of c, as can be easily seen by plotting the left-\nand right-hand sides of (4.9) against \u03bb and remembering that b\u03b3Ke\u2212\u00b5iT > \u00b5p + \u03b3K,\nsince this is the condition for the existence of (S\u2217, P \u2217). If c is very small, then (4.9) has\nno real positive roots, but if c is gradually increased, there is a critical value of c which\nwe shall call cmin (depending on T ) such that when c = cmin (4.9) has one positive\nroot (a double root), and when c > cmin the equation has precisely two real distinct\npositive roots. Only traveling fronts for which c \u2265 cmin are ecologically realistic, and\nwe assume that the virus infection travels with speed cmin since it is usually the case in\nreaction-di\ufb00usion equations that the front one actually sees is the one with minimum\nspeed (those with c > cmin usually have very small basins of attraction that rule out\nall but special initial conditions having very speci\ufb01c exponential decay rates).\nOur aim now is to \ufb01nd out more about cmin and its dependence on the parame-\nters. It is not possible to \ufb01nd an explicit expression for cmin, but we can \ufb01nd some\ninformation about it. Indeed, cmin is the value of c for which (4.9) has a double root\n\u03bb\u2217. Therefore, cmin and the double root \u03bb\u2217 must satisfy the simultaneous equations\ncmin\u03bb\u2217 \u2212Dp\u03bb2\u2217 + \u00b5p + \u03b3K = b\u03b3K exp(\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 \u03bb\u2217cminT + \u03bb2\u2217DiT ),\ncmin \u2212 2Dp\u03bb\u2217 = b\u03b3K(2\u03bb\u2217DiT \u2212 cminT ) exp(\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 \u03bb\u2217cminT + \u03bb2\u2217DiT ).(4.10)\nFrom these equations, we see that \u03bb\u2217 must satisfy f(\u03bb) = 0, where\nf(\u03bb) := 2DiDpT\u03bb\n3 \u2212 (2cminDiT + cminDpT )\u03bb2 \u2212 (2DiT (\u00b5p + \u03b3K)\u2212 c2minT + 2Dp)\u03bb\n+ cmin + cminT (\u00b5p + \u03b3K).\nNow f is a cubic and is such that f(0) > 0 and\nf\n(\ncmin +\n\u221a\nc2min + 4Dp(\u00b5p + \u03b3K)\n2Dp\n)\n= \u2212\n\u221a\nc2min + 4Dp(\u00b5p + \u03b3K) < 0.\nThese facts imply that the equation f(\u03bb) = 0 has one real negative root and two\nreal distinct positive roots. The larger of the two positive roots cannot satisfy the\n\ufb01rst equation of (4.10). Therefore, \u03bb\u2217 is the smaller of the two real positive roots of\nf(\u03bb) = 0. Furthermore,\n0 < \u03bb\u2217 <\ncmin +\n\u221a\nc2min + 4Dp(\u00b5p + \u03b3K)\n2Dp\n.(4.11)\nThe roots of a cubic equation are di\ufb03cult to write down in general terms because there\nare numerous cases depending on the signs of various quantities de\ufb01ned in terms of\nthe coe\ufb03cients in the equation. An appendix to the book by Murray [15] gives all the\n562 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\ndetails. Although the coe\ufb03cients of our particular cubic equation are complicated,\nwe know a priori that our cubic equation has only real roots, and this narrows down\nthe possibilities considerably. In fact, if we let\na\u2217 = \u2212cmin (2Di +Dp)\n6DiDp\n,\n\u03b1\u2217 =\n4c2minTD\n2\ni \u2212 2c2minTDiDp + c2minTDp2 + 12D2iDpT\u00b5p + 12D2iDpT\u03b3K + 12DiD2p\n36D2iD\n2\npT\n(it is easily shown that \u03b1\u2217 > 0),\nN = 8c2minTD\n2\ni + 36D\n2\niDpT\u00b5p + 36D\n2\niDpT\u03b3 K + 2c\n2\nminTDiDp \u2212 18DiD2p \u2212 c2minTD2p,\n\u03b2\u2217 =\ncmin (Dp \u2212Di)N\n108Di\n3Dp\n3T\n,\nand\n\u03c6 = (1\/3) sin\u22121\n(\n\u03b2\u2217\n2\u03b1\n3\/2\n\u2217\n)\n, \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/6, \u03c0\/6],\nthen the only root of f(\u03bb) = 0 satisfying (4.11) can be shown to be\n\u03bb\u2217 = 2\u03b1\n1\/2\n\u2217 sin\u03c6\u2212 a\u2217.(4.12)\nSubstituting \u03bb\u2217 into either equation of (4.10) then gives a single, but very complicated,\nequation determining the speed cmin.\nWe de\ufb01ne the function g(c) to be the left-hand side minus the right-hand side of\nthe second equation of (4.10), with \u03bb\u2217 given by (4.12) and cmin replaced by c. The\nresulting function is too complicated to write out explicitly but is easily handled in\nMAPLE. Of course, cmin solves g(cmin) = 0 and can easily be found either by reading\no\ufb00 the root from an accurate plot of g(c) or by using MAPLE commands for \ufb01nding\nroots numerically. Figure 3 shows a plot of g(c) for typical parameter values (see\ncaption). We investigated how cmin depends on the values of all the parameters, and\nour main observations were as follows:\n\u2022 If \u00b5i, \u00b5p, or T is increased, the result is a decrease in cmin.\n\u2022 If K, \u03b3, b, Di, or Dp is increased, the result is an increase in cmin.\n\u2022 If the delay T is large, then the value of cmin is much more sensitive toDi than\nto Dp. Presumably this is because virus particles with a host are transported\nat the di\ufb00usivity of the infectives. To illustrate this, let T = 7 and other\nparameters retain their Figure 3 values. Then cmin = 1.265. Keeping T = 7,\nif Di is then raised to 100, cmin rises to 5.623. But if instead Di = 5 and Dp\nis raised to 100, then cmin rises only to 1.976.\nAnalytical estimates for cmin can be obtained from other arguments, involving con-\nsideration of the graphs of the left- and right-hand sides of (4.9) as functions of \u03bb.\nWhen c = cmin these two graphs just touch, at the value \u03bb\u2217 just discussed. Consider\n\ufb01rst the case when Di < Dp (so the minimum of the right-hand side is to the right of\nthe maximum of the left-hand side). In this situation the maximum of the left-hand\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 563\n2\n0\n-2\n3\n1\n-1\nc\n8640 2\nFig. 3. Plot of the function g(c) de\ufb01ned in the text. The virus is predicted to spread at the speed\ncmin > 0 such that g(cmin) = 0. Parameter values used for this graph were K = 0.134, \u00b5i = 0.1,\n\u00b5p = 2, T = 0.2, \u03b3 = 1, Di = 5, Dp = 1, and b = 60. For these values, cmin = 5.646.\nside as a function of \u03bb is c2min\/(4Dp) + \u00b5p + \u03b3K, and this must be less than the value\nof the right-hand side when \u03bb = 0, which is b\u03b3Ke\u2212\u00b5iT . This leads to the estimate\ncmin < 2\n\u221a\nDp{\u03b3K(be\u2212\u00b5iT \u2212 1)\u2212 \u00b5p} if Di < Dp.\nIf Di is larger than Dp, but not too much larger, the above estimate on cmin will still\nhold.\nWe also carried out some numerical simulations of system (4.6) with a view to\n\ufb01nding out whether the minimum speed cmin found from the linearized analysis is the\nspeed which would be observed in practice. The question is whether the minimum\nspeed wave is in some sense robust, attracting large classes of initial data. These\nquestions are di\ufb03cult to resolve analytically. In a recent paper, Thieme and Zhao [19]\nproved results on asymptotic speeds of spread for a class of nonlinear integral equa-\ntions which include many reaction-di\ufb00usion models with delay, but their results do\nnot include system (4.6). Figure 4 shows the results of a numerical simulation of sys-\ntem (4.6). For initial data, susceptibles S were set equal to \u03b3 throughout the domain,\nand some phages were introduced at x = 0 into an otherwise phage-free domain. Fig-\nure 4 shows how the phages spread out into the domain and the e\ufb00ect on the density of\nsusceptible bacteria. Note that the traveling wave pro\ufb01les are nonmonotone. Careful\nexamination of the pro\ufb01les suggests that the traveling fronts advance at the minimum\nspeed cmin computed from the linearized analysis. The numerically computed front\nactually appears to travel at a slightly higher speed, but we are con\ufb01dent that this\nis purely a consequence of the discretization procedure. The speed varied slightly\nwith the number of spatial grid points but seemed to approach cmin from above as\n564 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY AND YANG KUANG\nFig. 4. Numerical simulation of system (4.6). Parameter values were Ds = 5, m = 1, \u03b1 = 1.34,\nand the remaining parameters were as in Figure 3. The simulation suggests that the asymptotic speed\nof spread is cmin, the minimum speed according to the linearized analysis.\nthe number of grid points was increased. As a result, we suggest that the asymptotic\nspeed of spread is indeed the speed cmin found from the linearized analysis.\n5. Discussion. A key observation of Beretta and Kuang [2, 4] is the sensitivity\nof the dynamics on the phage reproduction rate b. This remains so for model (2.1).\nThe novel observation of this work is the ultrasensitivity of the dynamics on the\nphage density dependent mortality rate m. This suggests that the density dependent\nmortality rate must be carefully measured to gain a better understanding of the\nbacteriophage infection dynamics in marine bacteria. Indeed, the recent work of\nKuang, Fagan, and Loladze [13] contends that the predator death rate almost always\npositively correlates with the predator density in nature. To see this for model (2.1),\nwe present Figures 5 and 6. Both \ufb01gures use initial data and parameter values identical\nto those in Figure 2, except that in Figure 5, m = 0, while in Figure 6, m = 0.2.\nThe second novel aspect of our work is the rigorous derivation of a delay reaction-\ndi\ufb00usion system to model the spatial spread of the virus infection and the use of\nthis system to formally calculate the speed at which the infection spreads through\na one-dimensional environment. The speed does not depend on the density depen-\ndent mortality parameter m just discussed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to \ufb01nd\na simple expression for the speed, but it can be found from numerical computation.\nAs we would expect, the speed depends on the di\ufb00usivity of both the infectives and\nthe phages but is much more sensitive to the value of the former than the latter.\nThis would be because virus replication takes place only inside a host, and therefore\nduring replication the di\ufb00usivity of the viruses is e\ufb00ectively the host di\ufb00usivity Di\nrather than Dp.\nSPATIAL SPREAD OF BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTION 565\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n\u03c4=0.01\ns,\n p\ns\np\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\u03c4=0.2\ns,\n p\ns\np\n0 10 20 30\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n\u03c4=0.3\ntime t\ns,\n p\ns\np\n0 10 20 30\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n\u03c4=1.1\ntime t\ns,\n p\ns\np\nFig. 5.
