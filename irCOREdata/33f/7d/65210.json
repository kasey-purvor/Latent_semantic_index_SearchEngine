INTRODUCTION\nW ITH the current drive toward renewable and other low-carbon generation, the geographical pattern of gener-\nator locations is changing. As a result, there is now significant\npenetration of generation in parts of the network, particularly\nthe distribution network, where formerly there was mainly load.\nA range of technical impacts (e.g., voltage rise, reverse power\nflows) dictate the amount of generation that may be connected\nwithout resort to network reinforcement. To maximize the po-\ntential of a network to support such distributed generation, it\nis important that these factors are carefully assessed, as poorly\nplaced generation can significantly reduce the total potential for\nconnecting generation [1]. Effective and efficient methods of as-\nsessing the capacity of the network to accommodate generation\nare therefore important, and there is a need to incorporate as\nmany of the relevant technical constraints as possible, including\nsecurity considerations.\nManuscript received October 16, 2008; revised June 16, 2009.

These have included a linear programming\nmodel to determine the optimal allocation of generation [2],\ntabu search in a loss minimization problem [3], and the use of\na genetic algorithm to solve a multiobjective problem, consid-\nering losses, costs, and power generated [4]. In addition, earlier\nwork involving two of the present authors has demonstrated\nthe use of an ac optimal power flow (OPF) model to assess a\nnetwork\u2019s capacity to accommodate generation [1], [5]. That\nframework forms the basis for this study.\nThe OPF was originally developed in the 1960s for network-\nconstrained economic dispatch and has since been applied to\nmany other problems [6], [7]. Its use in assessing the capacity of\nnetworks for connecting generation differs from the economic\ndispatch OPF both in the objective function (maximum network\ngeneration capacity, as opposed to minimum operating cost) and\nthe decision variables (the capacity of potential generators, as\nopposed to the output of fixed-capacity generators). In addition,\nfor economic dispatch the fixed demand limits the degree of\nnetwork congestion. Here, the maximization of capacity, with\nsurplus generation above the local demand being exported to\nan external grid, brings about greater levels of congestion; in a\nsense, the question is \u201chow hard can the network be run?\u201d\nAll transmission networks and many distribution networks\nare designed to operate in a secure mode to ensure continuity of\nsupply under an outage (or contingency) of a circuit (N-1 secu-\nrity), or in some cases any two circuits (N-2). The constraints\nimposed by secure operation reduce the transfer capacity of\nthe network, and specialized approaches have been developed\nto solve the resulting large security-constrained OPF models\n(SCOPF). One common option is to preselect a limited number\nof outage contingencies, which are likely to be significant [6].\nAn alternative approach, which allows efficient consideration\nof all contingencies, is to build a solution to the full problem by\nsolving a series of subproblems, in which appropriate combina-\ntions of contingencies are added at each iteration [8].\nThis paper presents a new efficient solution method for\nOPF models used to assess network generation capacity under\nsecurity constraints. The method is demonstrated on a modified\nversion of the meshed IEEE 73-bus Reliability Test System\n(RTS) [9] with N-1 security, in which new generators are given\nfirm connections. The method is, however, generic and may\nbe applied at any voltage level, for other security models, and\nfor other similarly-structured problems such as the analysis of\nmultiple availability\/demand scenarios for renewable resource\navailability. This solution approach brings two major advances.\nFirst, it resolves the problem that greater network congestion is\n0885-8950\/$26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Second, it provides a means of searching for\nmultiple locally optimal solutions to the OPF model while\nretaining the great efficiency benefits arising from the use of\nwarm starts in classical optimization algorithms.\nII. OPTIMIZATION MODEL\nThe OPF model for generation capacity assessment without\nsecurity constraints is discussed in detail in [1]. The mathemat-\nical structure of the constraints is very similar to more familiar\nOPF application of cost minimization. The principal and fun-\ndamental difference lies in the objective, which is to the total\ngeneration capacity in the network:\n(1)\nwhere is the set of possible locations for new generation,\nand is the MW generation capacity allocated to site ; if\ngeneration exceeds local demand, the excess is exported to an\nexternal network. Using a continuous variable for generation\ncapacity at each site is appropriate for a variety of distributed\nsources, where individual generator unit ratings might only be\na few MW.\nThis formulation implicitly assumes firm connections. At dis-\ntribution level, this correctly models the common situation in\nwhich the network operator is unable to dispatch generation. At\ntransmission level, where generation may be constrained at cost\nto the system, this model will show the absolute potential of\nnetwork sections for new generation (in a complete transmis-\nsion system, where substantial exports are not possible, gener-\nation and load must be balanced at all times; in this case an as-\nsessment of potential for new generation is not relevant without\nmarket considerations.)\nModifying this formulation to perform a cost benefit analysis,\nincluding the cost of existing generation, a simple network up-\ngrade model [5], and possibly the cost of additional interconnec-\ntion to other networks, is relatively straightforward; the solution\ntechnique, which is the main point of this paper, would be un-\nchanged. As discussed in Section III, the degree of congestion\nin generation maximization is higher than in the cost minimiza-\ntion; as a consequence, even if there are other terms present,\nrewarding increased generating capacity in the objective func-\ntion requires a modified solution approach.\nThe control variables in the optimization model are the new\ngenerator capacities, which are the engineering decisions made\nby the model. The other decision variables in the optimization\nproblem are state variables. Furthermore, features such as Var\nsources and tap changing transformers may be included using\nstandard power flow equations [10] without changing the so-\nlution technique. The intact-network constraints are standard\npower flow equations, apart from the presence of new gener-\nators; these add an extra power injection term in the Kirchhoff\ncurrent law constraints.\nFor the security model, constraints are added to represent the\npower flow equations for each contingency (i.e., circuit outage)\nconsidered. The reference bus is located at an external connec-\ntion. In the intact network power flow equations, all external\nconnections are equivalent (in the nonsecurity-constrained OPF,\nthe only special feature of the reference bus is its role as the ref-\nerence for voltage phase; the voltage levels at all external con-\nnections, along with the voltage phase at connections other than\nthe reference bus, are decision variables.) The reference bus is\nthe slack bus in the contingency power flow equations, in which\nit is a bus. Any other external connections are modeled\nas buses in the contingency flows. Where there is just\none external connection, this may still have multiple circuits for\nsecurity purposes, but the detail of these connections is not mod-\neled.\nNew generation and load buses are also modeled as\nnodes, while any existing voltage-controlling generators are\nnodes. The new generators are run in constant power\nfactor mode, as is common with distributed generation [11],\nwith the power factors of all the new generators equal. It is\nreasonably straightforward to use voltage or other control\nmodes instead [12]. Thermal, voltage, and generation level\nconstraints are included to ensure that the power flow remains\nfeasible postcontingency; the emergency (postcontingency)\nvoltage and flow limits may differ from their precontingency\nvalues. Postcontingency ramp rates are not explicitly taken into\naccount in the contingency constraints, but the time required\nfor system restoration will partly determine how much the\nemergency limits can be relaxed from the normal state ones.\nA full mathematical formulation of the optimization model is\ngiven in the Appendix.\nIII. SCOPF SOLUTION METHOD\nA. Previous Approaches\nIn a secure dc OPF, the linearity of the problem allows in-\ndividual contingency flow constraints to be included, without\nhaving to add the entire set of contingency power flow con-\nstraints. In the nonlinear ac OPF, however, limiting the post-\ncontingency flow on one line when another suffers an outage\nrequires the inclusion of the entire postcontingency power flow.\nMany approaches to the solution of large-scale ac SCOPFs have,\ntherefore, involved the pre-selection of a small number of the\nmost significant contingencies. Examples include [13], where\nthe two most important contingencies in a very large system are\nchosen manually, and [14], where a sophisticated automatic se-\nlection is performed.\nThe methodology presented here develops that of Alsac and\nStott [8] to solve the generation maximization problem effi-\nciently. They used an iterative process where first the nonse-\ncure OPF is solved, and then all contingencies in which power\nflow constraint violations occur are added to the security model.\nThe resulting SCOPF is then solved, and the process repeated\nuntil no violations are found. As mentioned earlier, in generation\nmaximization the level of congestion is much greater, because\ngeneration is limited only by the network constraints rather than\nby demand. As a result, when the base case OPF is solved, many\n(indeed possibly all) of the contingencies will show network\nconstraint violations, using the original Alsac-Stott algorithm\ndeveloped for cost minimization, these would all be added to\nthe OPF model. Direct solution of the resulting large optimiza-\ntion models requires substantial computer time.\nThis paper shows that great computational benefits can be ob-\ntained, while still guaranteeing convergence of the algorithm, by\nlimiting the number of contingencies added at each stage (and\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Solution algorithm for the security constrained OPF.\nhence size of the OPF models solved). It will also be seen that,\nwhere this is necessary, it is possible to search efficiently for\nmultiple local solutions by varying this limit on contingencies.\nA related approach to solving SCOPF problems has been pro-\nposed independently [15] and applied to cost minimization. As\ndemonstrated for the first time here, this class of approach is of\nparticular importance in applications such as generation maxi-\nmization where flows are not limited by nodal demands. More-\nover, it will be shown that the varying the limit on contingen-\ncies added provides a highly efficient means of searching mul-\ntiple local optima of the nonlinear optimization problem, where\nwarm starts are critical to the efficiency of a solution method, a\nsimple multiple-start approach may be very time consuming.\nB. Solution Methodology\nThe proposed solution method for the SCOPF is as follows\n(see also Fig. 1). is the set of all contingencies considered,\nis the set of contingencies explicitly included in the\nSCOPF, is the contingencies to be added to (removed\nfrom) , and is the contingencies, which have never\nbeen removed from .\n1) Initialize the security model with (no contingen-\ncies initially in security model). Initialize (no\ncontingencies yet removed from security model).\n2) Solve SCOPF with contingencies . For contingencies,\nwhich were included in the previous SCOPF, warm start\nthe contingency variables from their values in the previous\nsolution. For contingencies not in the previous OPF, warm\nstart the contingency variables from the previous base case\nsolution.\n3) Define to be all contingencies in with no\nactive voltage, reactive power, or flow limit constraints.\n4) Run contingency load flows for all contingencies in\n, i.e., those not considered in the SCOPF.\na) If more than contingencies give constraint viola-\ntions, define the set to be the contingencies,\nwhose load flows give the most constraint violations.\nb) Otherwise, define to be all contingencies giving\nconstraint violations.\n5) Terminate algorithm if no constraints are violated in these\nload flows.\n6) Update the list of contingencies in the SCOPF, .\na) Add the contingencies in to the SCOPF, i.e., in\nset notation update .\nb) Remove the contingencies in from the SCOPF\nand also from (the set of contingencies\nwhich have never been removed), i.e., update\nand .\n7) Go to Step 2.\nAny constraint violations detected in load flow runs (i.e., in con-\ntingencies not included in the most recent SCOPF model) will\nbe eliminated in subsequent SCOPF solutions, which explicitly\nconsider greater numbers of contingencies. When the algorithm\nterminates, it does so at a local minimum of the SCOPF, in-\ncluding warm starting from all contingencies, not just those ex-\nplicitly included in the security model .\nThis algorithm includes three augmentations beyond the sim-\nplest possible implementation of Alsac and Stott\u2019s approach:\n1) Warm Starting From the Previous Solution: It is to be ex-\npected that appropriate warm starts will accelerate the solution.\nHere, the intact network variables from the previous SCOPF so-\nlution are used as the starting values of new contingency vari-\nables. Using contingency variables from the previous solver run\nfor the warm start requires slightly more complex coding and\ngave no consistent benefit in run time.\n2) Limit on the Number of Contingencies Added: The Alsac-\nStott method may add a very large number of contingencies to\nthe security model on the first iteration. Moreover, explicitly\nincluding the most severe contingencies in the security model\nmay also eliminate violations in other contingencies, which are\nnot explicitly considered (the former are sometimes known as\numbrella contingencies [16].) It is, therefore, more efficient to\nlimit the number of contingencies added on each iteration to the\nworst in terms of constraint violations.\n3) Removal of Contingencies From the Security Model: The\nremoval of contingencies in Step 6 attempts to identify those\nwhose explicit consideration is unnecessary; this takes the idea\nbehind restricting the number added a step further. The size of\nthe OPFs solved is thereby reduced, leading to a corresponding\nreduction in the time taken per OPF solution. The restriction\nthat a contingency may only be removed once from the security\nmodel is necessary to ensure eventual termination of the algo-\nrithm, as eventually all contingencies must be added if termina-\ntion has not occurred. This prevents the algorithm from cycling,\nalternately adding and removing the same contingency. How-\never, for the test cases run here, the benefit in time per OPF so-\nlution is more than cancelled out by the requirement for a greater\nnumber of OPF runs. Detailed results including contingency re-\nmoval are, therefore, not presented in this paper; it would be\ninteresting to investigate whether contingency removal is bene-\nficial on other networks or classes of problem.\nC. Implementation\nThe model is coded in the AIMMS optimization modelling\nenvironment [17]. In addition to OPF models, AIMMS can also\nbe used to run the necessary load flow problems (this is achieved\nby formulating an optimization problems with a constant objec-\ntive function. The optimization solver then looks for feasibility\nalone and acts as a nonlinear equation solver.) Use of a modeling\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

AIMMS then generates the specific instance of the opti-\nmization problem from the model structure and data and passes\nit to the solver, also providing automatic generation of first and\nsecond derivatives of the constraint functions when required.\nThe AIMMS may be linked to a selection of efficient com-\nmercial solvers; here, the CONOPT generalized reduced gra-\ndient solver [17] is used. With default settings, it proved to\nbe competitive with the KNITRO interior point solver [17] in\nterms of speed and was absolutely reliable in convergence for\nthe SCOPFs in this paper. While KNITRO was slightly faster\nthan CONOPT when it did converge, using standard settings\nit frequently failed to do so when the number of contingencies\nincluded exceeded low single figures. Both solvers are able to\nhandle large numbers of hard nonlinear equality and inequality\nconstraints automatically and exactly.\nOccasionally, load flows did fail to converge in CONOPT on\nearly iterations of the algorithm. However, as long as these do\nnot occur later on, this does not risk the method terminating un-\nsuccessfully. It is likely that if the load flows were implemented\nusing specialized code, they would be faster and more robust,\nbut this would be at the expense of greatly increased develop-\nment time.\nIV. CASE STUDY\nA. Test Problem\nTo demonstrate the solution method, a modified version of the\nIEEE 73-bus RTS is used. It consists of three identical 24-bus\nnetworks and interconnections between them. The RTS layout\nis shown schematically in Fig. 2, along with a more detailed\nplan of area 1. It is not intended to be representative of any\nparticular power system, but it provides a convenient, reason-\nably large-scale heavily meshed network on which to demon-\nstrate the SCOPF solution method. This test problem shows the\nmethod\u2019s efficiency on large problems with many line outage\ncontingencies, but the method is generic across different voltage\nlevels and security models.\nA total of 15 new generation units are allowed to be connected\nat buses 1, 2, 7, 15, and 22 in each area of the RTS. The line char-\nacteristics of the RTS remain the same but the original demand\nspecified was halved (to 4.22 GW) to ensure a feasible problem.\nIn real-world applications, the algorithm would typically be run\nfor the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario, which for an exporting network\nwould be maximum generation and minimum load.\nOne hundred and five contingencies are considered in the as-\nsessment including all single-line outages except lines 10, 11,\n16, 17, and 23 in each area. Including any of these would leave\nan infeasible problem; lines 211 and 311 are single-circuit ra-\ndial connections.\nIn order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method,\ncalculations are performed with either one or four external inter-\nconnections, and one or three existing voltage-controlled gen-\nerators in each area of the RTS (these are not the same as the\ngenerators in the original RTS specification; only the original\nlayout and line properties are used.) The four cases are described\nin Table I. All external interconnections are modeled as having\nunlimited capacity (with finite capacities the solution technique\nwould be unchanged), and the reference bus is always located\nFig. 2.

Results\nThe OPF model was run for each case, both with and without\nsecurity constraints. The optimal new generation capacities\navailable in the network are shown in Table II.\nThe results without security constraints show that for the two\ncases with a single interconnection, the connectable capacities\nare very similar. There is slightly more capacity available where\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham. Downloaded on March 09,2010 at 07:47:22 EST from IEEE Xplore.

Locally optimal solutions found for the cases with nine existing\ngenerators.\nthere is a greater number of voltage-controlling existing genera-\ntors; it appears that despite a larger existing generating capacity\n(s1g3: 2400 MW; s1g9: 1800 MW) the greater overall reactive\ncapability in s1g3 allows slightly more (86 MW) new genera-\ntion to connect. The two cases with four export connections have\ngreater connectable capacities, as the particular constraints af-\nfecting bus 325 are less important. The available capacity differs\nmuch more between these cases; this is explained by the differ-\nence in existing generating capacity ( MW).\nAs expected, in all cases there are distinct reductions in ca-\npacity when the security constraints are applied. These reduc-\ntions range from 16% for the two cases with a single export con-\nnection (s1g3 and s1g9) up to 43% for case s4g9. Again there\nis a pattern in the capacities. The single connection cases each\nshow secure capacities of around 2.5 GW. The multiconnection\ncases now show fairly similar secure capacities and hence dif-\nferent reductions relative to nonsecure conditions. The differ-\nence in existing generating capacity appears to play little part\nin these cases under secure conditions. The reason for this dif-\nfering behavior between the nonsecure and secure cases is not\nclear; this issue demonstrates one benefit of using mathemat-\nical tools to analyze complex nonlinear problems, where a more\nheuristic approach might not be able to account for all relevant\nphenomena.\nAlthough the results are entirely repeatable between runs,\nnot all runs find precisely the same optimal capacity. As Fig. 3\nshows, the cases with nine existing generators, and particularly\nthose with multiple network interconnections, have multiple lo-\ncally optimal solutions depending on the number of contingen-\ncies added.\nFig. 4. Optimal generation site capacities with and without security constraints\nfor case s4g3.\nFor the cases with just one existing generator in each area,\njust one locally optimal solution is found; however, for cases\ns1g9 and s4g9 multiple locally optimal solutions were found\ndepending on the limit on contingencies added, as shown in Fig.\n3. It would appear that when there is more than one voltage-\ncontrolled generator that produces or consumes reactive power\nin each area, and particularly when there are also four external\nconnections through which power may be exported, the greater\nflexibility in the system results in these multiple locally optimal\nsolutions. The difference in capacity between different locally\noptimal solutions is fairly small: for the single connection case,\nthe worst solution differs from the best by around 1.4%, while\nfor the multiconnection case, the worst solution is around 5%\nbelow the best.\nIt is also informative to examine capacities at individual loca-\ntions (the layout of area 1 of the RTS is shown in Fig. 2.) Fig. 4\nshows the individual site capacities with and without security\nconstraints applied for s4g3. It is immediately apparent that in\nmost cases, when N-1 security is introduced, the capacities do\nnot scale equally. For instance, the capacity at bus 322 decreases\nby 63%, while that at bus 122 barely changes. Most of the gen-\neration is sited at buses 15 and 22 in each area of the reliability\ntest system, which are those closest to the external connections.\nWhere there are significant differences between the three areas\nof the RTS, this is partly explained by the pattern of intercon-\nnections between areas. For example:\n1) When security constraints are imposed, considerable\ngeneration capacity transfers from bus 102 to 107. Bus\n107 has an interconnection to area 2, so it appears to be\na robust site for generation under N-1 security. Buses\n207 and 307 do not have a similar interconnection, and\nno similar transfer of capacity is seen in areas 2 and 3.\n2) The main loss of capacity between the nonsecure and\nsecure models is at buses 115, 222, and 322. Unlike\nbus 115, the \u201cequivalent\u201d buses 215 and 315 are near\ninterconnections to areas 1 and 2, respectively, making\nthem robust sites under security constraints. Similarly,\nbus 122 is near the interconnection from 121 to 325,\nwhereas there is no similar interconnection near 222 or\n322.\nOnce more, the finer detail of the results is determined by the\nsubtle interplay between the various voltage and thermal con-\nstraints in the SCOPF model.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Time taken to solve to local optimality for network cases s1g3 and s4g9,\nfor a range of limits on contingencies added. The other two cases gave similar\nplots.\nC. Performance of Algorithm\nThis section compares the performance of the algorithm with\nmore conventional approaches. As timings of runs in AIMMS\n(running under Windows XP with an Intel 2.13-GHz dual core\nprocessor and 2 GB of RAM) varied slightly from run to run,\nthe times given are the smallest of three runs, to reflect most\naccurately the actual processor time used; for the three runs the\nactual calculations performed were identical, but the time taken\nfor completion could vary substantially between runs because of\nother active processes on the PC. The calculation results were\nrepeatable between runs. The memory usage for the very largest\nmodels was around 550 MB; this is smaller than the physical\nmemory of any modern PC.\nFig. 5 shows the solution times for cases s1g3 and s4g9,\nplotted against the maximum number of contingencies added\nper iteration . The shortest times were around 50 and 100 s,\nrespectively. For comparison, direct solutions of the various\ncases were performed using flat starts [i.e., all variables ini-\ntially zero except the voltage levels, which were set to 1 per\nunit (p.u.)]. The resulting mathematical programs had around\n100 000 variables and constraints. In cases s4g3 and s1g3, for\nwhich only one locally optimal solution was found, the solu-\ntion found by this direct method was the same as that found by\nthe approach presented in this paper; this demonstrates the va-\nlidity of the new method. For case s4g3, the direct solution with\nflat starts took around 11 300 s; direct solution warm starting\nfrom the base case (without security constraints) OPF solution\nreduced execution time to 513 s.\nThe effectiveness of the enhanced features of the algorithm\ndescribed in Section III-B is discussed in the next paragraphs.\n1) Warm Starts: As expected, using warm starts accelerates\nconvergence of the algorithm. Run times using flat starts are not\nplotted, as in all calculations performed they were at least three\ntimes greater than the warm start run times.\n2) Limit on the Number of Contingencies Added: As seen in\nFig. 5, the smallest run times occur when the limit on the\nnumber of contingencies added is between about 5 and 20.\nWith no limit on the number of lines added at each stage, the\nrun times were 194 s without removal and 240 s with removal for\nnetwork case s4g3 (33 contingencies are then added on the first\niteration.) In the other cases, without the limit almost all of\nthe contingencies are added in the first stage, and the algorithm\nthen terminates as there are no violations in the remaining con-\ntingencies. The run times are then 458 (case s1g3), 908 (s4g9),\nand 550 s (s1g9). By comparison with Fig. 5, it is clear that im-\nposing the limit on contingencies added is beneficial in all cases.\nThe total time taken is a tradeoff between the time for each\nOPF solution (smaller at low due to both the smaller opti-\nmization problems and the better warm starts) and the number\nof iterations (which as expected is smaller at large ). With the\nbest times for this network occurring for of between 5 and\n20, the lower end of this range is probably a good starting point\nfor single runs on other problems. Choosing too big a value for\ncarries a risk of large, hard mathematical programs being en-\ncountered; adding fewer than five contingencies is likely to re-\nsult in long run times due to the increased number of iterations.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe method offers an efficient means of determining the net-\nwork capacity available for generation connection, for a given\nnetwork configuration and loading condition, and with consid-\neration of security constraints. It would also provide an effective\nmeans of assessing single sites as it offers an automated means\nof determining whether a proposed connection exceeds the ca-\npacity of the network without the need for extensive manual ex-\namination of multiple scenarios. Furthermore, as demonstrated\nin [1], there is also the option to use it to examine the impact of\nplanning or connection decisions on future network capacity.\nIn a monopoly utility, this approach could be used directly\nin decisions on generator locations. In a liberalized market,\nwhere ownership of the network and generators are separate,\nit could find application within the process of determining\nuse-of-system charges; within such a framework, the method\ncould indicate good and bad places for generators to connect.\nThe structure of the method is such that it can be used not only\nin the large meshed network shown here, but also where a dis-\ntribution network is run in radial mode but security of supply is\nmaintained using network reconfiguration. The method assumes\nthat generation capacity is firm, but reliability and variability of\ngenerators could be taken into account using capacity factors\nsuch as those defined by the U.K. Energy Networks Associa-\ntion [18]. Further work is planned on both of these aspects.\nThe method can also be used for other contingency types,\nsuch as generator trips [19] and network reconfiguration. One\nkey point is whether a very high proportion of contingencies in\nany one category restricts the optimal solution; if this is the case,\nit might be most efficient to force their addition to the model\nearly on in the solution process.\nIn addition to the substantial efficiency benefits it brings for\na single run, the ability to vary the limit on contingencies added\ncan bring greater benefits still in problems with multiple local\nsolutions. The solution found using the \u201csequential warm start\u201d\nmethod is necessarily a local solution of the SCOPF including\nall contingencies. However, due to the nonconvexity of the ac\nOPF, there is no way of proving that the global solution has been\nfound [20], even when runs of the algorithm with different\nhave produced just one solution (although it is likely that the\nsingle solution is then the global one).\nFor large nonconvex nonlinear optimization models such\nas this, there are no efficient general purpose global solution\nmethods available. In practice, therefore, it is typically best\nto perform multiple runs of the same problem with different\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

In a sense, this has already been done by using\ndifferent values of . For network case s4g9, where several\ndifferent local minima were found, the best and most common\nsolution is probably the global optimum. If multiple starts\nof the same process are required, this is complicated by the\ncriticality of warm starts to the efficiency of the algorithm\n(possibly rendering impractical the simplest option of choosing\nrandom starts with initial values for variables chosen from their\nwhole range). The ability to choose different in the same\nalgorithm, therefore, provides a simple means of performing\nmultiple starts, which also resolves the issue of which gives\nthe quickest run time and best solution for an unseen problem.\nThis benefit would apply in any SCOPF problem and not just\ngeneration maximization ones with an enhanced degree of\nnetwork congestion.\nIn a distribution network, it is relatively unlikely that very ex-\ntensive meshing, or significant numbers of voltage-controlling\ngenerators or interconnections will be encountered. It appears\nmore likely then that a single local optimum will be found. In\nany case, in many planning applications, it is not absolutely nec-\nessary to know for certain that the best local optimum found is\nthe global optimum; a technique is valuable if it finds a solu-\ntion, which is better than those obtained by other means, and\nany good local optimum may, therefore, suffice. This might not\nbe the case, however, where an ac OPF is given statutory au-\nthority, e.g., if it is used for generator dispatch in a pool system.\nA similar issue arises where two different local solutions have\nsimilar objective function values. In this case, the difference\nin solution quality may well be within the approximation error\nin the model formulation, while the optimal values of decision\nvariables are very different. This situation has indeed been seen\nin the more complex network cases run on the RTS. For instance,\nin the case s4g9, when the limit on contingencies added\nchanges from 8 to 9, the locally optimal objective changes by\n0.63%; however, the average change in optimal generator ca-\npacities in area 1 is then 13.3%. Once more, if different local\nsolutions would influence contractual decisions, then this is a\nparticular cause for concern. On the other hand, under some cir-\ncumstances it might be regarded as beneficial to have a range\nof good locally optimal solutions with similar objective func-\ntion values, with a final decision being made on other grounds;\nwhere multiple local optima exist, this method provides a way\nof finding these multiple options.\nAll results here are based on the CONOPT 3.14A solver; it\nis possible that that contingency removal may still prove useful\nwhen working with other solution techniques (e.g., interior\npoint) or indeed on other networks. If a different solver is to be\nused, it must be remembered that while they can be highly effi-\ncient, interior point methods are generally so not well suited to\nwarm starts [21], as CONOPT\u2019s generalized reduced gradient\nmethod. As demonstrated here, complications arising from the\npresence of large numbers of nonlinear equality constraints are\nexpected to be due to multiple local solutions, rather than any\nfeatures of the solution method such as warm starting.\nThis work is currently being extended to problems involving\nnonfirm access with generation curtailment and multiperiod\ncalculations including consideration of variability of renewable\nresources [22]. In such applications, the number of scenarios\nconsidered grows exponentially with the number of renew-\nable resource profiles. Direct solutions on realistic network\nmodels could, therefore, involve extremely large optimization\nproblems, and the benefit from the method presented here is,\ntherefore, expected to be considerable.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents a method for determining the capacity\nof a network to accommodate generation under security con-\nstraints, making use of an OPF model designed to maximize\ngeneration capacities. The maximization of capacity, as opposed\nto cost minimization, brings about greater levels of congestion\nas power transfers in the network are not limited by fixed de-\nmand. For this application, therefore, specialized solution ap-\nproaches are especially valuable.\nThe model is solved by gradually adding limited numbers of\nline outage contingencies to the model, until a solution to the full\nproblem, including all contingencies, is obtained. The limit on\nthe number of contingencies added is key to the efficiency of the\nmethod, as it reduces both the size of the optimization problems\nencountered and the difference between successive problems.\nMoreover, varying the limit on contingencies added provides a\nhighly efficient way of searching for multiple locally optimal\nsolutions of the nonlinear optimization problem.\nThe method has been tested on a modified version of the\nhighly meshed IEEE RTS with N-1 security. When security con-\nstraints are imposed, there is a large reduction in the network\u2019s\ncapacity for new generation, which emphasizes the importance\nof considering all relevant physical and operational constraints\nin assessments. The method is generic and may be applied at any\nvoltage level, for other security models and for similarly struc-\ntured problems including the analysis of multiple scenarios for\nrenewable resource availability.\nAPPENDIX\nOPF FORMULATION\nA complete specification of the SCOPF model is given here.\nA.
