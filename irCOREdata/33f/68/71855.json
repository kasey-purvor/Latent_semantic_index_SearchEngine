Thus I will also discuss the social and economic functions that current \nwelfare regimes are expected to perform and the scales on which these functions \nare undertaken. My analysis starts from the interest in more or less radical reform of \npostwar welfare states and relates this to the weakening of their governance \nstructures as well as their policy effectiveness by the interaction of various economic, \nsocial, and political factors.  \n \nThe Keynesian Welfare National State  \n \nA highly provocative claim in this regard comes from Claus Offe, who, writing as \nissues of crisis, crisis-management, and crisis resolution moved up the political \nagenda, argued that 'while capitalism cannot coexist with, neither can it exist without, \nthe welfare state' (1984: 153, italics in original). My concluding comments suggest a \nsolution to 'Offe's paradox'. But this first requires a new analysis of welfare regimes \ngoing beyond what Offe and his neo-marxist contemporaries, for all their acuity, \ncould offer fifteen years ago, before the crises in and\/or of welfare regimes had \ndeveloped to the present extent (for a general critique of their position, see Klein \n1993). Thus, building on the French regulation approach to political economy and \nrecent institutionalist work on governance, I discuss the role of welfare regimes in \neconomic and social reproduction, the scales on which welfare is organized, and the \nforms deployed in governing them. \nAn important step in clarifying Offe's paradox is to identify the form of welfare state \nsaid to be in crisis. This is the form that became dominant in North Western Europe, \nNorth America, Australia, and New Zealand during the 1950s to 1970s and that was \nclosely linked with the Fordist growth dynamic. It can be described in ideal-typical \nterms as the Keynesian welfare national state (or KWNS). Each term in this fourfold \nconstruct highlights its distinctive features and ignores any generic properties the \nKWNS may share with other types of capitalist welfare regime. Thus, before \npresenting this ideal type, I justify the criteria used in constructing it and will thereby \nhighlight some general features of capitalist economic and social reproduction. \nThe four criteria derive from features of capitalism as a mode of production. The first \ncriterion is the state's distinctive roles in securing conditions for profitable private \nbusiness. This is the broad field of economic policy. It is important because market \nforces alone cannot secure these conditions and are supplemented by non-market \nmechanisms. This insufficiency is grounded in generic tendencies towards market \nfailure and in specific contradictions and dilemmas associated with capitalism. The \nsecond dimension refers to the state's distinctive roles in reproducing labour power \nindividually and collectively over various timespans from quotidian routines via \nindividual lifecycles to intergenerational reproduction (on lifecycles, see Falkingham \nand Hills 1995). This is the broad field of social policy. It matters because labour \npower is a fictitious commodity (Polanyi 1944; Brunhoff 1968). For, although it is \nbought and sold in labour markets and may add value in production, it is not itself \ndirectly (re)produced in and by capitalist firms with a view to private profit. Labour \npower enters the market economy from outside and is embodied in individuals who \nhave other identities than as bearers of labour-power. This poses economic \nproblems as regards its individual and collective suitability to capital's needs and its \nown survival in the absence of a secure income or other assets; social problems \nregarding social inclusion and cohesion; and political problems regarding the \nlegitimacy of state intervention in this area and its relation to other identities that \nworkers may have. The third dimension refers to the main scale, if any, on which \neconomic and social policies are decided \u2013 even if underpinned or implemented on \nother scales. This is important as economic and social policies are politically \nmediated and the scales of political organization may not coincide with those of \neconomic and social life. The fourth dimension concerns the relative weight of the \nmechanisms deployed in the effort to maintain capitalist profitability and reproduce \nlabour-power by compensating for market failures and inadequacies. This is where \nissues of governance are most relevant \u2013 although governance also enters into the \nother three dimensions. Top-down state intervention is just one of these \nmechanisms; and, as is well known, states as well as markets can fail. This suggests \nthe need for other supplementary mechanisms and, insofar as these also tend to fail, \nfor attention to the balance among them (Dunsire 1996; Bochel and Bochel 1998).  \n 2\nI now define the KWNS on these four dimensions. First, in promoting the conditions \nfor capital's profitability, it can be described as distinctively Keynesian insofar as it \naimed to secure full employment in a relatively closed national economy and to do so \nmainly through demand-side management. Second, in reproducing labour-power as \na fictitious commodity, KWNS social policy had a distinctive welfare orientation \ninsofar as it tried (a) to generalize norms of mass consumption beyond male workers \nin Fordist economic sectors earning a family wage so that national citizens and their \ndependants could all share the fruits of economic growth (and thereby also \ncontribute to effective domestic demand); and (b) to promote forms of collective \nconsumption favourable to the Fordist growth dynamic with its base in a virtuous \nnational circle of mass production and mass consumption. Thus economic and social \npolicies were linked to economic and social rights attached directly or indirectly to \ncitizenship of a national territorial state \u2013 whether this citizenship was based on \ndescent, acculturation, naturalization, political tests, or some other criterion (on types \nof national state, Jessop 1999a). Third, the KWNS was national insofar as economic \nand social policies were pursued within the historically specific (and socially \nconstructed) matrix of a national economy, a national state, and a society seen as \ncomprising national citizens. Within this matrix it was the national territorial state that \nwas mainly held responsible for developing and guiding Keynesian welfare policies \n(de Swaan 1992). Local and regional states acted mainly as relays for policies \nframed at the national level; and the various international regimes established after \nWW2 were mainly intended to restore stability to national economies and national \nstates. And, fourth, the KWNS was statist insofar as state institutions (on different \nlevels) were the chief supplement to market forces in securing the conditions for \neconomic growth and social cohesion. It was the combination of market and state on \ndifferent levels that prompted the use of the term 'mixed economy' to describe the \npostwar system (classically, Shonfeld 1965). In addition to its role in facilitating and \ncorrecting the operation of market forces, the state also had a dominant role in \nshaping civil society and thus the identities held by its citizens.  \nThere was never a pure form of KWNS. At best one finds particular welfare regimes \nthat combine the four features of the KWNS (in one or other of its variant forms) with \nother functions, scales of action, or modes of governance. Nor is there a pure crisis \nof the KWNS \u2013 only specific, path-dependent, nationally variable crises. In some \ncases there has been greater continuity, linked to the dominance of the view that \n 3\nthere was a crisis in the welfare state, with largely incremental shifts towards the new \nwelfare regime (e.g., Denmark); in others there has been greater discontinuity \u2013 \nadmittedly more marked in declared policy changes than actual policy outcomes \u2013 \nlinked to a discursively-constructed crisis of the welfare state (e.g., Britain). \n \nThe Importance of Governance \n \nFor present purposes 'governance' refers to any form of coordination of \ninterdependent social relations \u2013 ranging from simple dyadic interactions to complex \nsocial divisions of labour. Three main forms of coordination are usually distinguished: \nthe anarchy of exchange (e.g., market forces), the hierarchy of command (e.g., \nimperative coordination by the state), and the 'heterarchy' of self-organization (e.g., \nnetworks). Along with other commentators I refer to the third form of coordination as \n'governance in the narrow sense' in contrast to the broader concept that also \nencompasses market forces and organizational hierarchies (on governance and \ngovernance failure, see Jessop 1998; also Kooiman 1993; Dunsire 1996). \nWith the development of formally free labour markets, market forces became the \nchief mode of capitalist economic coordination. But the invisible hand, with its formal \nmonetary maximands, impersonality (working, as Marx put it, behind the backs of the \nproducers), procedural rationality, and post hoc operation, is supplemented through \nother modes of coordination that introduce more substantive objectives, elements of \ninterpersonal or interorganizational deliberation, orientation to collective goals, and \nex ante concertation. It is in this context that welfare regimes can help to secure \nsome of the key conditions for capital accumulation. For they are implicated in \ngoverning the economic, gender, ethnic, intergenerational (and many other) aspects \nof the division of labour \u2013 and indeed themselves contribute to the 'labour of division', \ni.e., the classification and normalization of individuals, groups, and other social \nforces as a basis for differential treatment in the division of labour and for social \ninclusion-exclusion (on the labour of division, Munro 1997). The concept of \ngovernance is very useful in analyzing welfare regimes as it enables us to classify \nregimes in terms of their typical combinations of modes of coordination. The concept \nof the 'mixed economy of welfare' (Titmuss 1963; Pinker 1992) captures aspects of \nthis; but, because it focuses on mechanisms of redistribution (occupational, fiscal, \n 4\nwelfare benefits), it neglects the ways that welfare regimes govern production and \nreproduction more generally.  \nIn this light one might consider three interrelated issues in the governance of welfare. \nThese are the changing definitions of welfare; the changing institutions responsible \nfor its delivery; and the practices in and through which welfare is delivered. These \nissues are closely linked. For it is a social scientific commonplace that governance \npractices (mediated by institutions) attempt to delimit, unify, stabilize and reproduce \ntheir objects of governance as the precondition as well as the effect of governing \nthem. Moreover, as recent Foucauldian analyses have emphasized, governance \npractices also typically aim to create and reproduce the subjects needed for \ngovernance to operate effectively (Barry et al., 1996; Hunt and Wickham 1993). \nThus, as the objects and modes of governance change, institutional mechanisms \nand actual practices change too \u2013 and so do the typical forms of governance failure. \nIn this sense we should see welfare regimes as constitutive of their objects of \ngovernance and not just as responses to pre-given economic and social problems. \nIndeed this is one of the bases on which the welfare state is often criticized \u2013 that it \ngenerates the problems it addresses. This also suggests that it will be self-expanding \n\u2013 always finding new problems to solve \u2013 and, perhaps, ultimately self-defeating as it \nbecomes more complex, overloads itself with tasks, and eventually produces a crisis \nof ungovernability (e.g., Crozier et al., 1975). \nWhether or not one subscribes to such criticisms, it was the purported failure of the \nKWNS as a mode of economic and social governance that prompted the search for \nnew forms of governance. Its alleged crisis affected not only the modes of \n'governance-government-governing' in the KWNS but also its objects and subjects of \nsocial and economic governance. More specifically, the KWNS began to fail as a \nmode of governance when its coherence as an institutional ensemble became \ninconsistent with the objects it was governing, the practices being deployed to \ngovern them, and the identities and interests of the active agents and\/or 'passive' \nsubjects of the KWNS regime. Thus, taking its four dimensions in turn, I would \nidentify the following crisis-tendencies. \nFirst, the primary object of economic governance in the KWNS was the national \neconomy. The emergence and consolidation of Keynesian practices had helped to \ndelimit and reproduce the national economy (Tomlinson 1985). They provided the \nmeans of measuring national economic performance, controlling economic flows \n 5\nacross national borders, setting economic aggregates such as inflation, employment, \nand growth as goals of national economic management, and creating the \ninfrastructure for national economic development. But Keynesian economic \nmanagement became increasingly problematic and generated stagflationary \ntendencies (stagnation plus inflation) that fuelled the emerging crisis of the Atlantic \nFordist economy that the KWNS was supposed to manage (Boyer 1991). Economic \ninternationalization exacerbated these problems. It undermined the national \neconomy as an object of economic management and led to quite different \nconceptions of the economy and, a fortiori, its mechanisms of economic and social \ngovernance. States could no longer act as if national economies were more or less \nclosed and their growth dynamics were primarily domestic (Teeple 1995). Replacing \nthe national economy as the primary object of economic governance is the \nknowledge-driven economy in an era of globalization (Castells 1996). Its growth \ndynamic depends on how effectively a given economic space \u2013 not necessarily a \nnational economy \u2013 is inserted into the changing global division of labour. This in \nturn has prompted concern with international economic competitiveness and supply-\nside intervention \u2013 initially to supplement national demand management, later as the \nprimary objective and means of economic intervention. \nThe imagined scope and inclusiveness of the economy that needs governing have \nalso expanded. This is no longer interpreted in narrow terms but has been extended \nto include many additional factors, deemed 'non-economic' under the KWNS regime, \nthat affect economic performance. This expansion is reflected in concepts such as \n'structural competitiveness' (Chesnais 1986) or 'systemic competitiveness' (Messner \n1997) \u2013 concepts that highlight the combined impact of diverse societal factors on \ncompetitiveness. State managers therefore intervene in a growing range of \neconomically relevant practices, institutions, functional systems, and domains of the \nlifeworld to enhance competitiveness. This has two interesting and paradoxical \neffects on the state. First, whilst it expands the potential scope of state intervention \nfor economic purposes, the resulting complexity renders postwar top-down \nintervention less effective \u2013 requiring that the state retreat from some areas of \nintervention and re-invent itself as a condition for more effective intervention in \nothers (Messner 1997). And, second, whilst it increases the range of stakeholders \nwhose cooperation is required for successful state intervention, it also increases \npressures within the state to create new subjects to act as its partners. Thus states \n 6\nare now trying to transform the identities, interests, capacities, rights, and \nresponsibilities of economic and social forces so that they become more flexible, \ncapable, and reliable agents of the state's new economic strategies \u2013 whether in \npartnership with the state and\/or with each other or as autonomous entrepreneurial \nsubjects in the new knowledge-driven economy (Barry et al., 1996; Deakin and \nEdwards 1993; Finer 1997; Jones 1999). \nSecond, the generic object of social governance in the KWNS (as in other forms of \nnational state) was a national population divided in the first instance into citizens of \nthe national state and resident aliens. But this population was categorized and \ngoverned in distinctive ways suited to Atlantic Fordism and its mode of regulation. \nAbove all, social policy was premised on conditions of full or near-full employment, \nlifelong employment \u2013 albeit not necessarily with the same employer \u2013 with a family \nwage for male workers, and the patriarchal nuclear family as the basic unit of civil \nsociety (Esping-Andersen 1994). The KWNS was also premised on a class \ncompromise between organized labour and organized business in which responsible \nunionism and collective bargaining permitted managers to manage and workers to \nbenefit from rising productivity as wage earners and welfare recipients. There were \nnonetheless some marginalized or overburdened social groups \u2013 most notably \nwomen as housewives, mothers, and secondary participants in the labour force and \nalso immigrants or other workers (and their families) who worked in disadvantaged \nsegments of the labour market (Lewis 1998). This pattern was undermined both \neconomically and socially. The crisis of Atlantic Fordism undermined the \nassumptions of full employment, the family wage, and the gendered division of \nlabour; and also led state managers to see the social wage increasingly as a cost of \ninternational production rather than as a source of domestic demand. The KWNS \nwas also affected by a weakening of the national identity and solidarity that shaped it \nin its formative period and helped sustain the coalition behind it. This is reflected in \nchanges in the values, social identities, and interests associated with the welfare \nstate. Indicators of this included rejection of the social democratic and\/or Atlantic \nFordist commitment to a class-based redistributive politics; a pluralistic identity \npolitics and 'politics of difference' that emphasizes mutual respect, authenticity, and \nautonomy; increased concern for personal empowerment rather than for the \nbureaucratic administration of legal rights, monetized entitlements, and uniform \npublic services; and expansion of the so-called 'third' sector, which supposedly \n 7\noperates flexibly outside of the framework of pure markets and the bureaucratic state \n(but often in close conjunction with them as a 'shadow market' and 'shadow state'). \nThese shifts have fragmented the KWNS coalition of forces, led to demands for more \ndifferentiated and flexible forms of economic and social policy, and led to concern \nwith problems of social exclusion and ensuring life-time access to the benefits of a \nrestructured welfare regime (e.g., lifelong learning).  \nThird, the primacy of the national scale of economic and social governance \ndepended on the coincidence of national economy, national state, national society \nand the survival of the national state as a sovereign body. This structured coherence \nhas also been weakened. The national economy has been undermined by \ninternationalization, the growth of multi-tiered global city networks, the formation of \ntriad economies (such as the European Union), and the re-emergence of regional \nand local economies in national states. This complex articulation of global-regional-\nnational-local economies is related to the 'hollowing out' of the national state as its \npowers are delegated upwards to supra-regional or international bodies, downwards \nto regional or local states, or outwards to relatively autonomous cross-national \nalliances among local metropolitan or regional states with complementary interests. \nThere are also growing attempts to internationalize (or, at least, Europeanize) social \npolicy. And, third, the unity of the nation-state has been weakened by the (admittedly \nuneven) growth of multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies and of divided political \nloyalties (with the resurgence of regionalism and nationalism as the rise of European \nidentities, diasporic networks, cosmopolitan patriotism, etc.) (Jessop 1999a). Thus \nwe see a proliferation of scales on which economic and social policy are pursued as \nwell as competing projects to re-unify inter-scalar articulation around a new primary \nlevel \u2013 whether this be the industrial district, the city-region, wider sub-national \nregions, cross-border regions, the triads, or the global level. \nFinally, the state's role in the mixed economy was undermined by several factors. \nThese include: growing political resistance to taxation and the emerging stagnation-\ninflation; crisis in postwar compromises between industrial capital and organized \nlabour; new economic and social conditions and attendant problems that cannot be \nmanaged or resolved readily, if at all, through continuing reliance on top-down state \nplanning and\/or simple market forces; growing resentment about the bureaucratism, \ninflexibility, and cost of the welfare state as it continued to expand during the late \n1960s and 1970s; and the rise of new social movements which did not fit easily into \n 8\nthe postwar compromise. Moreover, as society has become more complex and as \nnew economic and social conditions emerge that cannot be managed or resolved \nreadily, if at all, through the market and state as modes of governance, there has \nbeen increasing reliance on networks and partnerships as modes of coordination. \nOrganizationally the Fordist period was one of large scale, top-down hierarchical \nstructures and this model spread to the state's economic and welfare roles. This \nparadigm is being challenged by a new 'network paradigm' that emphasizes \npartnership, regulated self-regulation, the informal sector, the facilitation of self-\norganization, and decentralized context-steering (Messner 1997). Overall this \ninvolves a tendential shift from imperative coordination by the sovereign state to an \nemphasis on interdependence, divisions of knowledge, reflexive negotiation, and \nmutual learning. In short, there is a shift from government to governance in the \nnarrow sense. \n \nThe Schumpeterian Workfare Postnational Regime \n \nThese changes are reflected in four general trends in the restructuring of the KWNS. \nThe first is a shift from Keynesian aims and modes of intervention to Schumpeterian \nones; the second is a shift from a welfarist mode of reproduction of labour-power to a \nworkfarist mode; the third is a shift from the primacy of the national scale to a post-\nnational framework in which no scale is predominant; the fourth is a shift from the \nprimacy of the state in compensating for market failures to an emphasis on \nnetworked, partnership-based economic, political, and social governance \nmechanisms. These trends can be considered separately. Indeed, both severally \nand in combination, they have developed in quite different ways in the various \nAtlantic Fordist economies. They can nonetheless be summarized in terms of the \nsuggestion that the Keynesian welfare national state (KWNS) is giving way to a \nSchumpeterian workfare post-national regime (SWPR). Moreover, whether viewed \nindividually or in aggregate, these four changes are closely connected to the search \nfor solutions to the Atlantic Fordist crisis.  \nThe ideal-typical SWPR can be described as follows. First, regarding its functions for \ncapital, it is Schumpeterian insofar as it tries to promote permanent innovation and \nflexibility in relatively open economies by intervening on the supply-side and to \nstrengthen as far as possible their structural and\/or systemic competitiveness. \n 9\nComplementing these new strategic concerns in economic and social policy has \nbeen the demotion or rejection of other, earlier policy objectives. Whilst the KWNS \naimed to secure full employment, the SWPR demotes this aim in favour of promoting \nstructural or systemic competitiveness. Second, regarding social reproduction, the \nSWPR can be described (at the risk of misunderstanding) as a workfare regime \ninsofar as it subordinates social policy to the demands of labour market flexibility and \nemployability and to the demands of structural or systemic competitiveness. Thus, \nwhilst the KWNS tried to extend the social rights of its citizens, the SWPR is \nconcerned to provide welfare services that benefit business and thereby demote \nindividual needs to second place. This includes putting downward pressure on the \nsocial wage qua cost of international production. Concern with training and labour \nmarket functioning has long been a feature of state involvement in the social \nreproduction of labour-power, of course, but the SWPR gives greater weight to \nflexibility and endows it with new connotations (Ainley 1997). It is for these reasons \nthat there is also a major reorientation on the part of the state to the making and re-\nmaking of the subjects who are expected to serve as partners in the innovative, \nknowledge-driven, entrepreneurial, flexible economy and its accompanying self-\nreliant, autonomous, empowered workfare regime (for a recent illustration, Blair and \nSchr\u00f6der 1999).  \nThird, compared with the earlier primacy of the national scale, the SWPR is \n'postnational' insofar as the increased significance of other spatial scales and \nhorizons of action (or 'relativization of scale')1 makes the national territory less \nimportant as a 'power container'. This is associated with a transfer of economic and \nsocial policy-making functions upwards, downwards, and sideways. International \nagencies (such as the IMF, World Bank, OECD, and ILO) play an increased role in \nshaping the social as well as economic policy agendas; in Europe, moreover, the \nEuropean Union also has a growing role (cf. de Swaan 1992; Deacon 1995; \nLeibfried, 1993; Wilding 1997). But there is a simultaneous devolution of some \neconomic and social policy-making to the regional, urban, and local levels on the \ngrounds that policies intended to influence the micro-economic supply-side and \nsocial regeneration are best designed close to their sites of implementation. In some \ncases this also involves cross-border cooperation among regional, urban, or local \nspaces. In all three regards welfare governance has become more postnational. Yet, \nparadoxically, this leads to an enhanced role for national states in controlling the \n 10\ninterscalar transfer of these powers \u2013 suggesting a shift from sovereignty to a primus \ninter pares role in intergovernmental relations.  \nFinally, regarding the mode of delivery of economic and social policies, the SWPR \nhas a regime form because of the increased importance of non-state mechanisms in \ncompensating for market failures and inadequacies and in the delivery of state-\nsponsored economic and social policies. This provides a second important aspect to \nthe apparent (but deceptive) 'hollowing out' of national states, namely, the increased \nimportance of private-public networks to state activities on all levels \u2013 from local \npartnerships to supranational neo-corporatist arrangements (e.g., Clarke and Gaile \n1998; Falkner 1998). \nLike all ideal-types, the SWPR has been formed through the one-sided accentuation \nof empirically observable features (in this case, in Atlantic Fordist societies) to \nconstruct a logically possible social phenomenon. This does not presuppose actual \nexamples of the SWPR in pure form nor imply that any movement along its different \ndimensions occurs evenly and at the same pace. Indeed there is significant variation \nin the search for solutions to the alleged problems of the KWNS. It involves neither a \nunidirectional movement nor a multilateral convergence across all national regimes.  \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \nThis article has presented an ideal-typical contrast between two forms of welfare \nregime \u2013 the Keynesian Welfare National State and the Schumpeterian Workfare \nPostnational Regime. My other work on these two forms deals mainly with their \neconomic and social functions in reproducing private capital and labour-power. This \narticle addresses the governance of welfare regimes and the changing scales on \nwhich such governance occurs. It has argued that the national mixed economy of \nwelfare (based on a combination of market and plan) is giving way to a new \npostnational mixed economy in which networks and partnership have become more \nimportant. I have also argued that the subjects as well as the objects of governance \nare being reconstituted. Since this involves far more than a simple technical fix, it is \neasy to see why the transition from KWNS to SWPR is always politically mediated \nand often difficult. Thus, although my entry point for analyzing the transition is \ninspired by Marxist political economy, a critique of politics is also required. This \nwould serve not only to interpret the political mediations of the transition (as well as \n 11\nany 'conservation-dissolution' effects)2 but also the constitutive role of politics in \ndefining the problems to which the transition is a response and redefining both the \nobjects and subjects of governance. This in turn helps to explain why, despite a \ntendential de-nationalization of the state and a shift from government to governance, \nnational states still have major roles in shaping how the economic and social \nreproduction requirements of capital are met. For they try to determine which \nfunctions go upwards, downwards, and sideways and the conditions on which they \nstay there; and also seek both to design governance mechanisms and to politically \norganize self-organization.  \nSpace limitations prevented me from identifying sub-types of KWNS and SWPR and \nfrom assessing how far the posited changes have occurred in particular cases. But, \njust as there were different forms of governance in the KWNS, so the SWPR also \nhas variant forms (neo-liberal, neo-corporatist, neo-statist, and, as a supplement, \nneo-communitarian) (but see Jessop 1993, 1994, 1999b). While there are economic, \npolitical, and intellectual forces that are closely identified with one or other mode of \ngovernance, these sub-types are best seen as poles around which different national \nsolutions have developed (and are developing) during more or less extended periods \nof conflict and experimentation. Currently the neo-liberal form of SWPR is \nhegemonic on the international level but important counter-currents exist in specific \nnational and regional contexts. Each sub-type and each welfare-workfare mix has \ndifferent implications for welfare policy. The particular mix in individual cases will \ndepend on institutional legacies, the balance of political forces, and the changing \neconomic and political conjunctures in which different strategies are pursued. They \nwill also be overdetermined by factors beyond those included within this particular \napproach to the political economy of welfare. There is certainly no reason to expect a \nmultilateral convergence of welfare regimes around one sub-type of the SWPR \u2013 let \nalone a rapid convergence. \nFinally, I want to suggest a solution to 'Offe's paradox'. On the one hand, capitalism \n(in its Atlantic Fordist form) did co-exist with the welfare state (in its KWNS form) for \nan extended period. Eventually the Fordist growth regime and its KWNS mode of \nregulation became mutually contradictory. This prompted a search for new economic \nand social bases for capital accumulation; and this involved a partial dismantling of \nthe KWNS. In this sense the emerging post-Fordist capitalist regime cannot co-exist \nwith the KWNS. But this search extends to new forms of state (or, alternatively, \n 12\n 13\n                                           \nextra-economic) intervention that might help to re-secure conditions for private \nprofitability and the reproduction of labour-power. One could perhaps label this a \nsimple restructuring of the welfare state but emphasizing policy continuities in this \nway actually hides as much (if not more) than it reveals (the problem in, for example, \nKlein's critique, 1993). For the core organizational principles of the KWNS are being \nsuperseded in favour of those of the SWPR as a condition for the renewed co-\nexistence of capitalism and the welfare state. Nonetheless this has several possible \nforms and should not be reduced to the neo-liberal workfare state favoured by \nThatcher and Major \u2013 and taken as the starting point for New Labour's \"Third Way\").  \n \n \n \nEndnotes \n \n1   On the 'relativization of scale', see Collinge (1996). \n2   These effects occur when certain features of an earlier system are retained but \nacquire a new significance when inserted into an emerging system. \n \n \nBibliography \n \nAinley, P.
