Introduction \n \nFast oxygen ion conductors are an increasingly important class of materials, with \nwide ranging applications in sensors, gas separation membranes and Solid Oxide Fuel \nCells (SOFCs). The latter is the focus of much recent research, as the high efficiency \nand ability of SOFCs to act as a bridging technology between hydrocarbon and \nhydrogen fuel technologies makes them prime candidates for next generation power \nproduction.  \n \nApatite materials, particularly the rare earth silicate and germanate systems, are \nattracting great interest as a new class of oxygen anion conductor 1-20 . With high \nconductivities at intermediate temperatures (> 10-3 Scm-1 at 500\u00baC for a range of \ncompositions), they are of particular interest as SOFC materials, potentially offering \nthe opportunity to reduce the fuel cell operating temperature to a point where less \ncostly materials can be utilised in the SOFC construction. \n \nIsostructural with the well known Apatite mineral group, these materials take the \ngeneral formula M10(XO4)6O2\u00b1y, where M is a metal such as a rare earth or alkaline \nearth and X is a p-block element such as P, Si, Ge. With such a wide range of \nsubstitutional possibilities, there is great potential for optimising these materials\u2019 \nproperties. The structure (figure 1) comprises isolated XO4 tetrahedra arranged so as \nto form two distinct channels running along the c-direction. Occupying the smaller of \nthese channels are M cations, whilst the larger channel contains a \u201cring\u201d of M cations \nwith oxygen anions occupying positions in the channel centre.  \n 4 \n \nStudies have shown that conduction in these systems is wholly anionic 1,3 , with high \noxygen transference numbers (>0.9) across a wide range of oxygen partial pressures. \nSingle crystal studies 4,5 on Nd analogues have shown that this conduction is \nanisotropic, favouring the c-direction. It has also been observed that cation doping \nregimes and non-stoichiometry can significantly influence conductivity. In particular, \nit has been found that fully stoichiometric systems, such as La8Sr2Si6O26 exhibit \ngenerally poor conductivities, whilst samples containing cation vacancies at the \n\u00b1(2\/3,1\/3,z) sites show markedly improved conductivities, particularly if aliovalent \ncations, such as Ga3+, Al3+, have been doped onto the Si site, e.g. La9.83Si4.5M1.5O26 \n(M=Al, Ga) 1,6-10. The highest conductivities, however, are found for the oxygen \nexcess samples, e.g. La9MSi6O26.5 (M=Ca, Sr, Ba) 2,3,11. It has therefore been \nsuggested that conduction occurs along the [0,0,z] channel and goes via oxygen \ninterstitials, an implication strengthened by neutron diffraction studies of the \nLa9.33M6O26 (where M=Si, Ge) systems 6,12 in which the high conductivities were \nfound to be linked to a large degree of observed anion disorder along the [0,0,z] \nchannels.  \n \nRecent computer simulation studies of the La9.33Si6O26 and La8Sr2Si6O26 systems 13,14 \nsupport these observations, predicting an interstitial conduction mechanism along the \n[0,0,z] channels to be energetically favoured. Additionally a low energy interstitial \nposition was predicted to exist, lying close to the SiO4 substructure on the periphery \nof the [0,0,z] channels. Further experimental studies have provided confirmation of \nthis position, with Leon-Reina et al 15 showing occupation of a similar site in neutron \ndiffraction studies of the La9.55Si6O26.32, La9.6Si6O26.34 and La9.60Ge6O26.4 systems, and \n 5 \nKharton et al 16 reporting penta-coordinated Fe3+ in M\u00f6ssbauer studies of \nLa10Si5FeO26.5. \nThe understanding of the conductivity in these systems is still, however, incomplete. \nIn particular, the role of cation dopants and the observed oxygen disorder are only \nnow becoming better understood through modelling and neutron diffraction studies. \nIn this work previous studies on Co doping 7 are extended to investigate the structural \neffects of doping cobalt onto both the La and Si sites of the lanthanum silicate \nsystems via the complementary use of high resolution neutron diffraction and X-ray \nAbsorption Spectroscopy (EXAFS), so as to provide a detailed structural picture of \nthe effect of Co doping. The results highlight the structural complexities of these \napatite systems as well as their flexibility regarding cation doping on the La and Si \nsites. \n \n2. Experimental \n \nA selection of Co-containing samples were prepared with Co on either the Si site, \nLa9.83Si4.5Co1.5Co1.5O26, La9.66Si5CoO26, and La10Si5CoO26.5, or on the La site, \nLa8BaCoSi6O26. The samples were prepared from the starting materials La2O3, SiO2, \nand Co3O4. Stoichiometric mixtures were intimately ground and heated for 12 hours \nat 1350\u00baC with a second firing at 1400\u00baC, except for La8BaCoSi6O26, which was \ncalcined at 1250\u00baC and again at 1300\u00baC before final annealing at 1350\u00baC. Between \nfirings the samples were reground to ensure homogeneous reaction, with phase purity \nbeing ascertained using a Seifert 3003TT powder X-ray diffractometer.  \n \n 6 \nConductivity measurements were performed using AC impedance spectroscopy \n(Hewlett Packard 4192A Impedance Analyser). Samples for measurement were \npressed into 13mm diameter pellets and fired for 2 hours. For La9.66Si5CoO26, \nLa9.83Si4.5Co1.5O26 and La10Si5CoO26.5 a sintering temperature of 1625\u00baC was used to \nobtain dense pellets, whilst La8BaCoSi6O26 was fired at 1300\u00baC. Pt electrodes were \nthen affixed to the pellets using Pt paste and the pellet fired again, at 850\u00baC, for 30 \nmins to give good electrical contact between sample and electrode. \n \nTime of flight neutron diffraction data were recorded at the ISIS facility, Rutherford \nAppleton Laboratory. Two instruments were used: HRPD and POLARIS. HRPD was \nused for the samples La9.66Si5CoO26, La9.83Si4.5Co1.5O26 and La10Si5CoO26.5, whilst for \nLa9.83Si4.5Co1.5Co1.5O26 POLARIS was employed. All structural refinements \nemployed the GSAS suite of Rietveld refinement software 21.  \n \nExtended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge \nstructure (XANES) measurements were performed using the 2GeV Daresbury \nSynchrotron Radiation Source. The EXAFS experiment measures the oscillations \nbeyond a chosen X-ray absorption edge arising from interference of an ejected \nphotoelectron wave with the fraction of the wave backscattered from neighbours of \nthe absorbing atom. Fourier transform of this oscillatory fine structure yields a radial \ndistribution in real space with peaks corresponding to the electron density surrounding \nthe absorbing atom. Analysis of this can reveal information relating to the local \nenvironment of chosen atom types. \n \n 7 \nData were collected using two instruments: Si-K edge (1.84keV) EXAFS was \nperformed using station 3.4, whilst Co-K edge (7.71keV) EXAFS and XANES data \nwere collected using station 7.1. Twin single crystal monochromators (InSb(111) for \nstation 3.4, Si(111) for station 7.1) were used for wavelength selection. Due to \nabsorption effects, all data for our samples were collected in fluorescence mode, \nwhilst Co-K edge XANES data for the reference samples CoTiO3, YSr2Cu2CoO7 and \nLaCoO3 were collected in transmission. Several scans were performed for each \nsample and the thus obtained data summed to reduce statistical noise. Data analysis \nwas performed using the Daresbury suite of EXAFS software: EXCALIB, \nEXSPLINE and EXCURV98. For the Si and Co edge data of La9.66Si5CoO26, only the \nfirst shell M-O was fitted, due to the complexity of the structure beyond the first shell. \nFor the Co edge data of La8BaCoSi6O26 only shells out to 3.4\u00c5 were fitted, as \nincreasing structural complexity again rendered the addition of further shells \nstatistically invalid.  \n \n3. Results and discussion \nThe samples La9.83Si4.5Co1.5Co1.5O26, La9.66Si5CoO26, La10Si5CoO26.5, and \nLa8BaCoSi6O26 were successfully prepared. Attempts were made to incorporate \nfurther Co onto the La site, and so prepare La8Co2Si6O26, however impurities were \nobserved for such a sample. \nAs previously reported 7 the conductivities for samples doped with Co on the Si site \nwere high (\u03c3500\u00b0C = 2.95 x 10-3Scm-1, 1.5 x 10-3 Scm-1, and 2.47 x 10-3 Scm-1 for \nLa9.66Si5CoO26, La9.83Si4.5Co1.5Co1.5O26, La10Si5CoO26.5 respectively). In contrast the \nconductivity of the sample with Co doped onto the La site, La8BaCoSi6O26, was low \n(\u03c3500\u00b0C= 9.2 x 10-7 Scm-1). This sample is nominally stoichiometric on both the rare \n 8 \nearth and Si sites, and so the low conductivity is consistent with previous results that \nfully stoichiometric samples, e.g. La8M2Si6O26 (M=alkaline earth) exhibit poor \nconductivities 6,9,20. \n \n3.1 \u2013 Structural Determination \n \nAs apatite systems have been reported to exhibit a variety of space groups, depending \non ordering effects, initial Rietveld analysis of the diffraction data focussed on the \ndetermination of the appropriate symmetry for our systems. In accordance with \nprevious studies on apatite type systems, three space groups were examined: P63\/m, \nP63 and P-3, with the assignment being based on the residual R-factors.   \n \nIt has been found in previous studies that conductivity in these systems is strongly \ncorrelated with evidence of oxygen disorder along the [0,0,z] channels. This is \nmanifested in high Anisotropic Thermal Displacement Parameters (ADP\u2019s) for the \nchannel O5 oxygen site, particularly for U33, which corresponds to displacement \nalong the channel c-direction 17. In our recent investigation of the La10-ySi6-xGaxO26+z \nsystem 18 we also found high ADP\u2019s for the tetrahedral SiO4 oxygen positions, and \nevidence of localised distortions of the tetrahedra. Similar effects were also observed \nfor La9.33Si6O26 which has no Si-site dopants 6. \n \nInitial refinements of the La9.83Si4.5Co1.5O26 data gave good agreement between our \nstarting model and observed powder pattern, and we were able to assign the space \ngroup P63 to the system. For the compositions La9.66Si5CoO26 and La10Si5CoO26.5, \nhowever, there was poor agreement between observed and calculated peak intensities \n 9 \nfor all chosen symmetries. Close inspection of the diffraction patterns showed that \npeaks of index hk0 were sharp, whilst peaks of index l>1 showed broadening. \nParticularly broadened were peaks of high l and low hk values (124\/214, 125\/215 etc), \nand the only clearly observable 00l peak, 004, showed pronounced broadening. To \naccount for this an additional lorentzian-type peak profile parameter was included in \nthe refinement, with the broadening vector set along the c-axis. With this parameter \nincluded in the refinement, it was again found that P63 was the most statistically valid \nspace group. It should be noted that the La10Si5CoO26.5 data was refined as the non-\nelectroneutral composition La10Si5CoO26. Initial attempts to locate the interstitial 0.5 \noxygen using Fourier DELF maps yielded no obvious positions of unfitted scattering, \nand so models including an additional channel-edge \u201cO7\u201d type position, as predicted \nby our modelling studies, were investigated. A stable site located at (0.0509, 0.2371, \n0.8241) was found, and an overall stoichiometry of La10Si5CoO26.6 calculated, but as \nthe refinements showed no statistical improvement in fit we were unable to justify its \ninclusion in our final model. For all other samples, no anion non-stoichiometry was \nfound, nor were any compositions found to deviate from expected cation \nstoichiometry. In accordance with previous experimental observations, and \npredictions from modelling, the 6c La site was found to be fully occupied by La, with \ndopants and La non-stoichiometry preferring the \u00b1[2\/3,1\/3,z] channel positions. \n \nFor the composition La8BaCoSi6O26 we again initially assigned space group P63, \nrather than P63\/m which is usually exhibited by fully stoichiometric systems. Using \nthis symmetry Co and Ba were suggested to order along the \u00b1[2\/3,1\/3,z] La channels, \nwith La taking equal occupation of both channel positions. However, investigation of \nthe respective interatomic bond distances for the Ba and Co containing sites showed \n 10 \nlittle difference, despite the large difference in ionic radii for Ba2+ and Co2+ (1.49\u00c5 vs \n0.79\u00c5 for octahedral coordination). Subsequent calculation of Bond Valence Sums for \nthe system indicated that no model of cation ordering was consistent with the \nobserved bond distances, and so P63\/m symmetry was again investigated. This \nassignment removes the possibility of cation ordering, as the two 6-fold \u00b1(2\/3,1\/3,z) \nchannel positions in P63 become a single 12-fold position with P63\/m. With this \nsymmetry choice, a weighted mean Bond Valence Sum of 2.56 was calculated for this \nsite. This agrees well with the expected value of 2.5 for our chosen structural model, \nin which Ba and Co dopants are present in addition to La. Space group P63\/m was \nthus assigned. \n \nOur final refined structure parameters and Rietveld residual agreement values are \npresented in tables 1-4, and fitted profiles for La9.66Si5CoO26 and La8BaCoSi6O26 are \nshown in figures 2 and 3. From our results, several points are worthy of discussion: \n \n Our work shows that Co is seen to dope onto both the nine-coordinate channel \nLa positions and onto the tetrahedral Si site depending on the starting composition \nemployed. Our XANES results (see below) indicate that La is substituted by Co2+, \nwhilst Si is substituted by Co3+, as would be expected from ionic size considerations \nand sample stoichiometry. \n \n In accord with our previous studies on related systems 6,18, an ordering of the \nLa vacancies is observed for the La9.83Si4.5Co1.5O26 and La9.66Si5CoO26 compositions, \nin which the distribution of these vacancies in the La positions within the structure is \n 11 \nnot random, but concentrated on the \u00b1(2\/3,1\/3,z) positions whilst La fully occupies \nthe other position. \n \n Analogously with our previous studies on the La10-xSi6-yGayO26+z system, we \nfind that for samples with Co doped onto the Si sites, both the unit cell c-axis and \nSi\/Co-O bond distances increase with increased Co content, due to the larger size of \nthe Co3+ dopant. A similar lengthening of the c-axis is observed for the La10Si5CoO26.5 \ncomposition, due to the increased oxygen content. In contrast, the doping of Co onto \nthe La site in La8BaCoSi6O26 causes a general contraction of the unit cell, as expected \nfrom the smaller size of Co2+ compared to La3+.  \n \n High values were obtained for the oxygen Anisotropic Displacement \nParameters (ADP\u2019s), with the O(3) and O(5) positions in particular exhibiting \nunrealistically large values (tables 1b). Significant distortion of the SiO4 tetrahedra is \nalso observed for the La9.66Si5CoO26 and La10Si5CoO26.5 compositions, with a long Si-\nO(4) bond being displayed. A high level of static disorder of this sort is common even \nfor undoped apatite systems, where it is suggestive of the existence of \u201cO7\u201d type \ninterstitials as predicted by our modelling studies, and found experimentally by \nKharton et al 16 and Leon-Reina et al 15. Formal inclusion of such sites in diffraction \ndata analysis is difficult however, as site occupancy is low and, as found in both this \nwork and by Leon-Reina et al, the stable interstitial site lies ~1\u00c5 from the silicate \nsubstructure, requiring local relaxation of the structure around the site, which is not \npossible to model accurately with diffraction methods. With occupancy of the silicon \nsite by the larger cobalt cation in our systems, the uncertainty in silicate oxygen \npositions is already significant, and a very high level of observed disorder is expected \n 12 \nin this area of the structure. This explains why no improvement in R-factors was \nachieved by the inclusion of additional oxygen sites at the channel periphery, even \nthough they may indeed be present. \n \nThe observed peak broadening provides further evidence of such disorder, being very \nsimilar to that reported previously for La9.33Ge6O26 17 and for the Cd5-x\/2(VO4)3I1-x and \nCd5-x\/2(PO4)Br1-x systems 17,22,23. For the latter, electron diffraction patterns showed \nhighly structured diffuse scattering along the c-direction. It was postulated that for \nthese systems the effect arises from a displacive distortion of either the (0,0,z) Br or \n\u00b1(2\/3,1\/3,z) Cd positions, leading to a different c-directional periodicity for these \npositions than for the host structure. Considering the relative thermal parameters for \nthe La and O sites in our systems, it seems most likely that the effect arises from a \ndistortion along the O(5) channels. It is apparent that this is only observed for the \nsystems in which Co is substituted on the Si-site (its apparent absence in the \nLa9.83Si4.5Co1.5O26 data is attributed to the lower resolution of the Polaris instrument), \nand that it is observed for both La9.66Si5CoO26 and La10Si5CoO26.5 compositions. Also \nof note is the fact that such peak broadening is not observed in HRPD data obtained \nfor the equivalent Ga doped systems, despite the similarity in ion size and charge. \nThis does not preclude the existence of such distortions in the Ga systems 18, but \nrather indicates that the forces between O(5) channels which drive the ordering of \nsuch displacements are stronger for the Co systems. The presence of this ordering in \nboth the cation deficient La9.66Si5CoO26 and the fully cation stoichiometric \nLa10Si5CoO26.5 sample also suggests that the distortion is not driven by ordering of \nvacant La sites in the \u00b1[2\/3,1\/3,z] channels, but rather of the oxygen.  \n 13 \nAnother interesting feature from this work is that for La8BaCoSi6O26, U33 for the \nchannel oxygen is high (8.03 \u00c52, table 3), and yet the conductivity is low. The low \nconductivity is consistent with previous results that for high conductivity in these \napatite systems, nonstoichiometry in the form of cation vacancies and\/or oxygen \nexcess is required, however the high value of U33 might suggest a high conductivity \nshould be observed. Thus arguments that the high conductivity in apatite systems can \nbe related to the high U33 for the channel oxygen seem to be simplistic and other \nfeatures, such as the silicate network as predicted by modelling studies 13,14, must play \na key role. \n \n3.2 \u2013 XANES and EXAFS \n \nAs diffraction techniques can only give information relating to the structural average, \nwe have used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to examine the local structure for \nindividual sites in our materials. For our studies we have chosen to investigate the \nchanges in local structure upon doping both Co for Si and Co for La. The objective of \nthe experiments were threefold. Firstly to demonstrate conclusively that Co can be \ndoped onto both Si and La sites according to our chosen stoichiometries, secondly to \ndetermine the oxidation state of the Co dopant, and finally to relate any changes in \nlocal structure with the disorder displayed from the neutron diffraction data. \n \nThe Co-k edge positions calculated from XANES spectra of our compositions are \npresented in table 5, along with those for three standards, CoTiO3, YSr2Cu2CoO7 and \nLaCoO3. These respectively represent octahedral Co2+, tetrahedral Co3+ and \noctahedral Co3+. From edge positions alone we were able to confirm the Co \n 14 \nenvironments for La8BaCoSi6O26 and La9.66Si5CoO26 as octahedral Co2+ and \ntetrahedral Co3+ respectively. Analysis of the spectra (figures 4a and 4b) confirms this \nassignment, with La9.66Si5CoO26 and YSr2Cu2CoO7 sharing a strong pre-edge and \nLa8BaCoSi6O26 showing an almost identical spectra to CoTiO3. This latter assignment \nis highlighted by the strong structural distortion seen from the Co EXAFS analysis, in \nwhich the local site coordination is lowered from 9 to 6. \n \nFor doping on the Si position, EXAFS data for both dopant and Si edges are \npresented, although due to difficulties with sample alignment, the quality of Si-edge \ndata were found to be inferior to that of the Co edge. This resulted in slightly low \nDebye Waller values being obtained for Si edge data. For doping on the La position, \nonly the Co dopant edge data are presented. We note that the La-edge EXAFS is too \ncomplex to analyse, due the co-occupation of two distinct crystallographic sites in the \nstructure by La. \n \nThe final fitted parameters for our EXAFS investigation of the Si site local structure \nin La9.66Si5CoO26 are presented in table 6a, with fitted data shown in figures 5-6. \nVisual inspection of the spectra confirms the expectation that Co3+ dopes onto the Si \nsite. Data analysis confirmed a 4 coordinate environment for both edges. First shell \nSi-O bond distances of ~1.58\u00c5 were obtained, whilst for the Co edge a value of 1.85\u00c5 \nwas calculated, indicating a considerable difference in local structure around the \ndopant species. This agrees well with the increase in site size that would be expected \nfrom the relative ionic radii considerations, and also supports the origin of the \nstructural disorder exhibited in the neutron diffraction data. There is thus a marked \ndifference in the local structure surrounding the Si and dopant species. This is in \n 15 \naccord with the increase in site size that would be expected from the relative ionic \nradii. Due to the complexity of the structure beyond the first shell, and the poor \nresolution of the second shell in all data, no structurally sensible information could be \nobtained for shells other than the first, and so it was chosen to leave further shells \nunfitted.  \n \nVisual inspection of the fourier transform data collected for the Co-K edge of \nLa8CoBaSi6O26 (figure 11) clearly shows a very different shell structure to that seen \nfor the Si-site local environment, confirming substitution of Co2+ onto the lanthanum \nsublattice, in accord with the calculated energetics. However, the choice of starting \nmodel for analysis was difficult, as the 1st and 2nd shells do not correspond well to the \nreference crystallographic data for either La site. Our starting models were thus \nderived with reference to our preliminary modelling studies 24. \n \nOur final fitted model is presented in table 6. We note that only shells out to 3.4\u00c5 \nwere fitted, as increasing structural complexity and poor data resolution made the \naddition of further shells statistically invalid. Substitution onto the La(1) sublattice \nwas confirmed, but with considerable distortion of the local structure: the Co2+ dopant \nassumes a strong 6-coordination, with interatomic distances to the first five shells all \nbeing shortened by ~0.4\u00c5 relative to the crystallographic \u201caverage\u201d. For the M-O(2) \ndistance of the first shell this represents a very significant contraction of >15%, and \naccords with expectations based upon the relative ionic radii for La3+ and the Co2+ \ndopant (1.17\u00c5 and 0.79\u00c5 respectively). We note that the six-coordinate first shell \nexhibits slightly high Debye-Waller factors. This arises because the shell is actually \ncomprised of two three-coordinate shells at slightly different radial distances (table 6). \n 16 \n \nAlthough the data does not allow resolution of the shell structure at longer distances, \nit is reasonable to assume that the shortening of the M-Si distances is also indicative \nof an effect on the SiO4 unit as a whole, \u201cpulling\u201d the unit away from the [0,0,z] O(5) \nchannel. As the SiO4 units show faces to both the La and O(5) structural channels, it \ncan be suggested that doping on the La channel site positions can thus have a \nsignificant effect on the periphery of the O(5) channels, along which oxygen \nmigration is predicted to occur. It is also notable that this distortion occurs very close \nto the low energy \u201cO7\u201d interstitial position predicted from our previous simulation \nstudies 13,14, and so may influence the formation\/migration of such interstitial oxygen \ndefects. \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe results presented here demonstrate that Co can be doped onto both the Si and La \nsites in the apatite structure, with the data suggesting that it substitutes onto the Si site \nas Co3+, and onto the La site as Co2+.  \nThe structural data collected using the high resolution diffractometer, HRPD, showed \nsignificant complexities, with evidence for anisotropic peak broadening for samples \nwith Co on the Si site. This anisotropic peak broadening has been attributed to an \nincommensurate ordering of the oxygens within the channels. \n \nThe EXAFS data confirms that the doping on both Si and La sites causes significant \nstructural changes, which could have an important effect on the conduction in these \nmaterials. \n 17 \n5.
