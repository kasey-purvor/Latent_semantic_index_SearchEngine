Gottwald\u2217\nMathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia\nIan Melbourne\u2020\nMathematics and Statistics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, UK\nRecently Hu, Tung, Gao and Cao investigated the 0-1 test for chaos. By looking at random\ndata and at data stemming from the one-dimensional logistic map they concluded that the test is\nunreliable. Moreover they claim that a method developed by Gao and Zheng is superior to the 0-1\ntest. We explain why their criticism and claims are unfounded.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.-a\nKeywords: Chaos, dynamical systems, nonlinear time series analysis\nRecently a paper appeared [1] in which the 0-1 test for\nchaos [2, 3] was investigated with respect to its reliability.\nThe authors accepted the reliability for distinguishing be-\ntween regular and fully developed chaos. However, their\nconclusions were largely negative, and they presented an-\nother method which was claimed to be superior. In this\nComment we refute the criticism on the reliability.\nWe first recall the 0-1 test, following [3] where we gave\na modified and simplified version of the original test [2];\nthe modified test deals better with noisy data. Consider\na scalar observable \u03a6(n). In an experiment, \u03a6(n) is a\ndiscrete set of measurement data. Choose c > 0 and\ndefine\np(n) =\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u03a6(j) cos jc, (1)\nfor n = 1, 2, . . . Define the mean square displacement\nM(n) = lim\nN\u2192\u221e\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nj=1\n[p(j+n)\u2212p(j)]2 and the asymptotic\ngrowth rate K = limn\u2192\u221e logM(n)\/ logn. If the under-\nlying dynamics is regular (ie periodic or quasi-periodic)\nthen K = 0; if the underlying dynamics is chaotic then\nK = 1. (We refer to [2, 3] for the justification of these\nstatements.)\nIn practice, letN denote the amount of data. Through-\nout this Comment, we compute M(n) for N\/100 \u2264 n \u2264\nN\/10 to ensure that 0 \u226a n \u226a N . Then we compute K\nby performing a least square fit for logM(n) versus logn.\nThis is done for 100 randomly chosen values of c and the\nmedian value of K is the final output of the test (cf. [3]).\nSection II of [1] is devoted to \u201cunderstanding\u201d the test\nfor chaos, namely that the test examines how the vari-\nance of the auxiliary process p(n) scales with time. This\ninterpretation is correct but was already present in the\noriginal paper. Indeed, the \u201cR-extension\u201d discussed in [2,\n\u2217Electronic address: gottwald@maths.usyd.edu.au\n\u2020Electronic address: ism@math.uh.edu\nSection 5] corresponds exactly to the \u201cfluctuation analy-\nsis\u201d in [1]. As mentioned explicitly in [2, Section 5], the\nnecessity to subtract off the mean is a nontrivial obstruc-\ntion, whereas a crucial property of the 0-1 test (which is\nan \u201cSE(2)-extension\u201d) is that the mean automatically\nvanishes (due to rotation symmetry in the plane). A\ndeeper understanding of the 0-1 test would recognise the\nissue with the mean which underlies the development of\nthe test in [2].\nThe mathematics behind the test establishes a di-\nchotomy for deterministic systems: bounded or diffusive\nbehaviour of the mean zero random walk. This is one\nof the strengths of the test, a binary diagnostic 0 or 1,\nwith no grey areas in principle. (There are always grey\nareas in practice for any test.) Hence Section III of [1]\nwhich highlights the \u201cmisclassification\u201d of 1\/f\u03b1 noise (it\nis shown that the 0-1 test yields K = 1 independent of\nthe choice of \u03b1) has missed the point. Moreover, it is\na misapplication of the test; as clearly stated in both\nour manuscripts [2, 3] the test is designed for determin-\nistic (but possible noisy) systems. (Indeed, the paper [2]\nis entitled \u201cA new test for chaos in deterministic sys-\ntems\u201d.) The problem of distinguishing between chaotic\nand stochastic dynamics \u2014although of obvious practi-\ncal importance \u2014 is different from the problem we are\nworking on and hence is not grounds for criticism.\nSection IV of [1] discusses the \u201cedge of chaos\u201d and\n\u201cweak chaos\u201d in the context of the logistic map xn+1 =\naxn(1 \u2212 xn) + \u03c3\u03b7n where a is the bifurcation parameter\nand \u03b7n \u223c N (0, 1). It is claimed that the 0-1 test can-\nnot distinguish properly the edge of chaos at a = a\u221e =\n3.569945672... and weak chaos at a = a\u221e + 0.001. We\nrefute this claim below on three different levels: (i) For\nthe parameters considered in [1] a visual version of our\ntest is effective; (ii) For most practical purposes the au-\ntomated test is effective with a moderate amount of data;\n(iii) In theory the automated test works with probability\none. For brevity, we restrict to clean data \u03c3 = 0 (see [3]\nfor noisy data).\nStarting with (i), for the specific parameters a\u221e and\na\u221e+0.001 we computed K versus N up to N = 50, 000.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 1 and show a clear func-\n2tional difference of K(N). Also defining p(n) as in (1)\nand q(n) =\n\u2211n\nj=1 \u03a6(j) sin jc, we plotted p(n) versus q(n)\nin Fig. 2. Here N = 5000 suffices for an effective visual\ntest. Again this visual test was explicit in the original\npaper [2, Section 5]. We should emphasise that a major\nadvantage of our test over methods such as [1] is that it\nis easily automated and in most cases it is not necessary\nto make a visual interpretation of the results.\n-0.02\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n 0  25000  50000\nK\nN\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 0  30000\nK\nN\n-0.005\n 0\n 0.005\n 0  30000\nK\nN\nFIG. 1: Plot of K as a function of N for the logistic map\nat a = a\u221e and a = a\u221e + 0.001. Although the value of K\nis small in both cases, the behaviour of K as a function of\nN distinguishes the two cases. The corresponding graphs for\nfully developed chaos at a = 3.99 and regular dynamics at\na = 3.561 are shown in the left and right insets respectively.\nq\np\nq\np\nFIG. 2: Plot of p versus q for the logistic map. (a) a = a\u221e;\n(b) a = a\u221e + 0.001. We used 5000 data points.\nFor (ii), see Fig. 3 where the results of our test are\nshown for N = 5000. The parameter a is incremented\nin steps of 0.01 for 3.5 \u2264 a \u2264 4 and it is clear that the\nautomated test (ie the computed value of K) is effective\nfor most values of a.\nTurning to (iii), the dynamics of the logistic map is\nparticularly well understood [4]: almost every value of a\nyields either a periodic attractor or a chaotic attractor\nsatisfying the Collet-Eckmann condition. It then follows\nfrom results in [5] and [6] respectively that with proba-\nbility one K converges to 0 and 1 as N \u2192\u221e.\nFinally, [1] use a method developed by one of the au-\nthors [7] to demonstrate its superiority over the 0-1 test.\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.9  4\nK\na\nFIG. 3: Plot of K versus a for the logistic map with 3.5 \u2264\na \u2264 4 increased in increments of 0.01. We used 5000 data\npoints.\nThe method, which requires phase-space reconstruction,\nis a variant of the (unreferenced) method developed by\n[11] and independently by [12] for calculating the max-\nimal Lyapunov exponent; the difference being that the\nmethod is applied for different shells. Normalise so that\n\u03a6(i) \u2208 [0, 1] and define Xi = [\u03a6(i),\u03a6(i + 1), . . . ,\u03a6(i +\n(m \u2212 1)\u03c4 ] where m is the embedding dimension and \u03c4\nthe time delay. The quantity\n\u039b(k) =\n\u2329\nln\n(\u2016Xi+k \u2212Xj+k\u2016\n\u2016Xi \u2212Xj\u2016\n)\u232a\nis evaluated for a sequence of shells r \u2264 \u2016Xi \u2212 Xj\u2016 \u2264\nr + \u2206r with specified radii r and thickness \u2206r. The\nclaim is that for deterministic chaotic time series there\nexist values of m and \u03c4 such that the quantity \u039b(k) has\na common envelope for different shells with the slope of\nthe envelope at small k being the maximal Lyapunov\nexponent, whereas stochastic motion is characterised by\na non-existence of such a common envelope. This method\nhas been applied to several low-dimensional systems [8]\nand also to experimental data [9].\nThe authors show that their method easily distin-\nguishes the edge of chaos and weak chaotic dynamics for\nthe logistic map for noise-free data. As seen in Fig. 1 and\nFig. 2 the 0-1 test can distinguish these two cases as well\nby visual inspection of either the functional dependance\nof K or the p-q-plot.\nIn [3] we showed that the 0-1 test has certain\nadvantages over classical methods particularly for high-\ndimensional systems. Difficulties with methods relying\non phase-space reconstruction are well documented [10]\nand it is here that the 0-1 test stands out. We refer to\nour paper [3] for an examination of the 8-dimensional\nLorenz system with measurement noise where we\ncompared against the original method of [11]. In this\ninstance, our test proved to be superior as an absolute\ntest for chaos with respect to methods using phase-space\nreconstruction.\n3In conclusion, the claim that the 0-1 test is not reli-\nable is unsubstantiated. The authors chose to focus on\n(a) situations where the test was not intended to apply,\nand (b) very specialised situations in tiny regions of pa-\nrameter space. In this Comment we have reiterated the\neffectiveness of the 0-1 test outside these regions and es-\ntablished the efficacy of our test in situation (b). The\nclaims in [1] are thus shown to be based on misunder-\nstandings regarding the intended scope and implemen-\ntation of the test. (These confusions might have been\nresolved more efficiently if we had been contacted per-\nsonally, or at least been given the opportunity to referee\nthe criticisms).\nWe agree with the final comment of the authors that\nscientists should use all available methods to characterise\nand analyse complex data; for essentially deterministic\ndata the 0-1 test is such a method. We do not claim\nthat our test will replace traditional methods such as\nthose relying on phase-space reconstruction but that it\navoids certain well-documented drawbacks of such tests\nand hence is likely to be advantageous in certain situa-\ntions.\nAcknowledgments\nGAG is partly supported by ARC grant DP0452147.\nGAG and IM are partly supported by EPSRC grant\nGR\/S22714\/01.\n[1] J.
