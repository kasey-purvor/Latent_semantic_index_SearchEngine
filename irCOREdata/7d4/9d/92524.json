This study estimated service and non-service costs in a random sample of patients attending a community psychiatric mental health centre in Italy.

METHODS : A randomly selected sample of patients identified during one week of routine clinical activity was enrolled.

Costs were classified in two categories: service costs (from the provision of services) and non-service costs (loss of productivity and informal care). RESULTS : One hundred and twenty patients were included. In patients suffering from schizophrenia the monthly service cost per patient was nearly double that for patients with other diagnoses. Non-service costs associated with patients\u2019 lack of job opportunities were more than three times higher for patients with schizophrenia, accounting for a total monthly non-service cost per patient more than three times higher than that for patients with other diagnoses.
