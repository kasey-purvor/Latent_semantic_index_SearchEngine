We unpack the play of category \nmembership in this episode to illustrate how conflicting agendas can lead to the \nconstruction, even in ostensibly empowering encounters, of identities actively disavowed \nat the level of official discourse. \n \n* Main document (inc. abstract, figs and tables)\n2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn one sense, the 'identity' of being intellectually impaired is an official cover-sheet \ndiagnostic fact, recorded on documents. According to the definitions used by authorities \nsuch as British Psychological Society (2001), the American Association on Mental \nRetardation (1992) and the American Psychiatric Association (1994), to diagnose \nsomeone as having a learning disability (or mental retardation, in North American usage) \nis to diagnose them as having a low IQ and to have what is called poor 'social \/ adaptive \nfunctioning'. However, social policy has to go beyond diagnosis, and prescribe what \nsociety must do. In the modern discourse of social policy, the person with learning \ndisabilities is not merely someone with cognitive limitations, but someone with rights. As \nthe UK Department of Health puts it, in a key policy document: \n \n4.1 People with learning disabilities currently have little control over \ntheir own lives, though almost all, including the most severely disabled, \nare capable of making choices and expressing their views and \npreferences. The current problems are:  Services have been too slow to \nrecognise that people with learning disabilities have rights like other \ncitizens .... [list continues] (Valuing People, Chapter 4, p 44) \n \nThe question for service providers (such as, in Britain, the National Health Service) is, \nhow are those rights to be acknowledged, and, indeed, promoted? There is a potential \ndilemma at the actual level of everyday social interaction between service providers and \npeople with learning disabilities (henceforth, LD). On the one hand,  service providers \nought to orient to the official, diagnostic features of having LD: delayed comprehension, \nlimited memory span and the difficulties in social\/adaptive skills that are supposed to \nfollow from these cognitive impairments. A member of care staff, for example, acting \nwithin the official designation of the intellectual limits of the person with LD, might \npermissibly (or necessarily) speak to them slowly, less abstractly, and so forth. Indeed, \nliterature on interviewing people with learning disabilities often recommends such \n3 \napproaches (e.g. Finlay & Lyons, 2001; Prosser & Bromley, 1998). On the other hand - \nand this may be a conflict - the service provider ought to respect and promote the \nindividual's rights: to personal choice, views and preferences, as the official discourse has \nit (see the extract from Valuing People, above). \n \nBut it is a matter of ordinary observation to say that those who talk to people with \nlearning disabilities often modify what they say, and how they say it, in ways that seem \nintuitively to assume a greater degree of impairment, and across a broader range of areas \nof life, than is necessary. This has been termed a \u2018deficiency perspective\u2019 (Booth & \nBooth, 1994), or a \u2018deficit intervention\u2019 (Goodley, 2000). Some of these ways of talking \nimply that the person with learning disabilities has reduced rights to choose, express a \npreference or have a view. To talk with them that way is to imply an 'identity', just as \nmuch (or perhaps more) than does the explicit naming as 'deficient', 'retarded' and so on. \nSuch terms are, in themselves, neutral. Indeed, historically they were a welcome \nreplacement of a previous generation of terms like \"cretinous\", \"imbecilic\" and the like.  \nFor an individual on the receiving end, the descriptive term on his or her case-notes is \nless important than the treatment they get from the people around them.  \n \nIf that treatment presumes deficiency, that might be rationalised within a medical model \nof disability as nothing more than a realistic appraisal of the consequences of the person's \ncognitive or linguistic limitations. However, social models of disability (e.g. Goodley, \n2000; Oliver, 1990) alert us to the ways in which social processes and even the \ninstitutions developed to support disabled people can further disable. \n \n It is here that the flexibility of the second aspect of the diagnostic criteria becomes \nimportant; recall that people with learning disabilities are identified in part by a \nmeasurable impairment in \"social and\/or adaptive functioning\". The British \nPsychological Society defines this as the individual requiring \u201csignificant assistance to \nprovide for his\/her own survival \u2026. and\/or with his\/her social\/community adaptation \n(e.g. social problem solving, and social reasoning)\u201d (British Psychological Society, 2001, \np.6). But this assistance, and the 'adaptation' it is meant to provide for, has to be realised \n4 \nin actual interaction. It is at the interface of rights and self-determination, on the one \nhand, and assumptions of impairment in comprehension and social awareness and \nreasoning on the other, where we would expect to see delicate (and indelicate) identity-\nbased negotiations occur between people with learning disabilities and others. \n \nThis suggests, we think, that a close study of language in interaction will add to our \nunderstanding of intellectual impairment, at least if we are interested in how the \nintellectually impaired person navigates through the world. Analysis of how such a \nperson is talked to will show up what the reports of people with learning disabilities \nthemselves suggests - that the 'identity problem' for people with LD happens when they're \nattributed with deficiencies well beyond memory limitations, speech production \ndifficulties and so forth, and when these attributions have implications for their social \nrights  (for examples, see Bogdan & Taylor, 1994; Finlay & Lyons, 2005; Goodley, \n2000). \n \nIdentities in theory and in practice \nWe shall be looking, then, at talk, and how a speaker - even one who is institutionally \ncommitted to a progressive social services policy - might set the person with LD in a \nworld more restricted than would be defensible on the basis of their official intellectual \ndiagnosis. The  broader context is the observation that there are potential sources of \ndifficulty in the social relationships between people with learning disabilities and the staff \nwho are paid to support them. Identities and their associated rights can be conceived as \nboth ideologically mandated (in such discourses as 'mission statements', white papers, \nformal agendas and other instruments which embody social policy) and discursively \nproduced (in the turn-by-turn architecture of talk), with the possibility of inconsistency, \nand indeed contradiction, between the two.  \n \nIn the data we shall be examining, we illustrate how in these two identities - the \ntheoretical and the actual - might conflict. That is, the identities being discursively \nproduced might contradict those that are being ostensibly promoted in the situation. This \npossibility is an important one to acknowledge in public services, where official service \n5 \nphilosophies and policies encourage the expression of particular, empowered identities \nand outcomes, as advocated in \u2018person-centred\u2019 approaches (Department of Health, \n2001). Here we might find \u2018lip service\u2019 being paid to the philosophy, while actual \npractice, the enactment of identities and relationships, remains unaffected. Exploring this \ninterplay of identities, then, has the potential to inform the social model of disability, \nparticularly in its attempts to understand how medical\/impairment models of disability \nmight persist despite changes in the discursive content of services.  \n \nThe particular episode we describe involves members of care-staff ostensibly seeking the \nviews of residents with LD about their relationships; and ending up (as we shall argue) \ncoaching the residents in who it is that they may (or ought to) call 'their friend'. Coaching \npeople about who their friends are is a delicate business, fraught with implications about \nthe competence as social beings. Our analysis tries to bring out how, in what they say and \ndo, the care staff cast the residents into a social identity with defective social rights. \n \nIt is important to say at the outset that what the reader will find here is a case-study. We \nwant to examine, in detail, one case of how a thoroughly routine piece of business \nimposes a flawed identity onto persons with an intellectual disability. Case-studies reveal \nand explicate, but they are not surveys. We cannot say how often cases like this happen, \nnor speculate why it happened here, in the sense of psychological motivation. This is a \nsingle incident, in one group meeting, in one residential home. That the conduct of the \nmeeting it is utterly routine - in the sense that no-one in the episode seems surprised, or \nput out, by what happens - suggests at least that what we see is something within the \nrange of normal practice; and what we shall see is how there can be (presumably \nunwanted) disempowering categorisation even in interactions between care staff and \nresidents which are intended to be educative and empowering.  \n \n \nConversation Analysis \n \n6 \nTo get a sound grip on what speakers are doing with their talk, we use the accumulated \nconceptual apparatus of Conversation Analysis (henceforth, CA), which promises to \nreveal how social action is achieved through the medium of talk in interaction. In the \nforty years since the pioneering work of the group around Harvey Sacks (whose lectures \nwere published posthumously as Sacks, 1992),  CA has developed into a \nmultidisciplinary enterprise attracting sociologists, linguists and psychologists, among \nothers (for a sense of CA's beginnings, see Sacks, 1992; for overviews of its methods and \nstyle, see Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998, and for a comparison with other forms of \ndiscourse analysis, Wooffitt 2005).  Within the field of research on learning disability, \nCA has been used to study the communicative competence of people with a learning \ndisability (e.g. Wootton, 1989), the practices of their assessment (e.g. Antaki, 1999), the \nmanner in which they manage their identities in interviews (e.g. Rapley, Kiernan and \nAntaki, 1998), and the way they are referred to in case worker consultations (Wareing \nand Newell, 2005) among other topics. \n \nThe signal characteristics of CA are a reliance on recorded data which can be minutely \ninspected; and an openness to the way the participants in a scene display their own \nunderstandings of what they are doing and saying, including the identities they attribute \nto themselves and others. The theoretical perspective of CA on identities is that they \nshould not be researched as if they were pre-given and enduring, but rather as they come \nup, and are used, in interaction. As Antaki and Widdicombe (1998) put it, taking up the \nthread of CA work since Sacks (1992): \n \n\"...a person's identity is their display of, or ascription to, membership of \nsome social category, with consequences for the interaction in which the \ndisplay or ascription takes place. [...] Membership of a category is ascribed \n(and rejected), avowed (and disavowed) and displayed (and ignored) in local \nplaces and at certain times, and it does these things as part of the \ninteractional work that constitutes people's lives.\" [Antaki and Widdicombe \n1998, p 2; emphasis added] \n \n7 \nIt is important to be clear that we shall see, in the data we analyse, identity-ascription \n'doing interactional work' in two distinct ways. One is in how staff talk about third \nparties. That is, how they instruct residents in what kind of person it is who must be \nincluded in the identity-category of 'friend'. The other is in the staff's implicit \nconstruction, by this very act of coaching, of the identities of the residents themselves. \n \nAn explicit note is in order on the very notion of 'disabled identities'. The reader will not \nsee anyone in these data, explicitly call another person 'disabled' or use any more or less \npolite alternative (say, 'intellectually challenged' or 'retarded') still less an offensive one \n('cretin', 'mongol' and the like). Certainly that happens in other times and places, and it is \nfair then to say that one has seen someone being ascribed an 'disabled identity'. But \nidentity ascription is more subtle and pervasive. It is very important for our argument that \nsomeone can be ascribed a disabled identity not just by naming but being treated as \ndisabled. \n \nTo see how that treatment cashes out, we shall be mobilising CA's observation that it a \nspeaker can ascribe an identity by, as it were, 'hinting' (see, for example Sacks on the \nconceptual apparatus required to permit such things as a reference to being a 'hair stylist' \nto be, at least in the time he was writing,  an  index of sexual orientation; Sacks, 1992, \nVol 1 Part I, lecture 6). We shall see two main ways of hinting (or of exploiting the \ncategory-bound features of an identity category, to use more technical terminology) and it \nmay help orient the reader if we prefigure the analysis in outline. We shall be looking at \ntalk among  members of staff who are facilitating a routine discussion among a group of \nresidents who have learning difficulties. First we shall see that the facilitators of the \ngroup suggest to their learning-disabled residents, in a discussion of 'relationships', that \nthe category 'care worker' belongs naturally in among a the categories 'family members \nand friends'. That is identity-work in its own right, but seemingly concerns the identity of \ncare workers - what implication does it have for the listening learning-disabled residents? \nIt has an indirect, but powerful implication for the hearers' identity. They are being \ntreated as folk for whom the 'natural' boundaries between  professional staff and intimate \nfamily and friends does not obtain: the residents are too 'disabled' to enjoy the distinction. \n8 \nThe second is more direct. It is to treat the residents as not being able to form their own \nsense about who their friends are, and whose feelings ('natural' in anyone else) have to be \nexplicitly coached.  \n \n \nData and Analysis \n \nOur data come from a residents\u2019 meeting recently held in a residential home in Britain1. \nAccording to the manager of the home, the aims of these meetings were to empower \nclients, to discuss day-to-day concerns that residents may have had, and to offer a social \nvenue to facilitate group interaction and communication. Other staff members saw the \nmeetings as providing an opportunity for residents to have a say in the running of the \nhome, to air their grievances, and to contribute to planning future activities. The meetings \nwere also used for instructional purposes. In the meeting we examine, the staff members \nhad the following (pre-written) agenda items in their hands: do we all know what to do in \ncase of fire?; ask clients where are the fire points?; ask clients what they would do in case \nof fire; update clients with the procedures for night and day. The meetings were attended \nby the residents of the home and whichever staff were on duty at the time. Two staff \nmembers and eight residents were present at the meeting we discuss here. Personal and \nplace names, and other identifying details, have been changed. \n \nThe talk we shall discuss comes some 13 minutes into the session. The pre-written \nagenda item reads as follows: the Day Centre is doing a course on relationships - ask \nclients what is a relationship, in their view; ask clients what they know of relationships. \nAn official characterisation  of this episode of the group meeting would be that the staff \nmembers are pursuing the institutional goal of encouraging discussion and instructing the \nresidents in 'relationships', presumably with the aim of increasing their understanding of \nthe term so that they are better able to describe their social situation and, perhaps, \nimprove it.   \n \n                                                 \n1  We are grateful to Treena Jingree for access to these data \n9 \nOur extract starts with \"Melanie\", one of the two staff members present, introducing the \ntopic thus : Right, d\u2019you all know what relationships are? This is initially met with \nsilence, until the other staff member \"Ann\" rephrases the topic as a question and directs it \n(line 3) at a particular resident. (Notation, which attempts to approximate the way the \nspeakers delivered their words, is explained in Appendix 1. A continuous transcript of the \nepisode can be found in Appendix 2.) \n \n \nExtract 1 \n01 Mel     right (.7) >d\u2019you all know what< relationships are \n02         (1.2)   \n03 Ann    Kelly (.8) what\u2019s a relation[ship \n04    Tim                              [(      [    ) \n05\u2192 Kat                                   [cousins= \n06    Ann     =don\u2019t know \n07            (.4) \n08 Mel     yes \n09 ?

They \nare both types of \u2018relationships\u2019 but also \u2018relations\u2019, a contraction of the word \n\u2018relationships\u2019 (note that there is overlapping talk which begins half way through the \nword \u2018relationships\u2019 on line 3). The arrowed lines signal her contributions of cousins, \nniece and uncle. It is important that we establish this, as later we shall see that the \nresidents' competence in knowing what relationships they have, and being able to given \nthem a proper name, is precisely what becomes an issue.  \n \nWhat is 'a relationship'? \n \nThe next extract, which follows on immediately, shows that Tim is says he doesn't know, \nbut Kat's answer in terms of family relationships is indeed acceptable to the staff: Mel \nexplicitly instructs Tim that it can be your mother. \n \nExtract 2 \n22    Ann    =yeah what\u2019s a relationship= \n23 ?      =hoo (bit obvious) \n24        (.5) \n25 Tim   dunno what it is[     no \n26 Ann                 [(sighs) \n27        (.2) \n28 Kat    eh \n29        (.) \n30 Mel    It can be your moth [er:, \n31 Tim                    [(r'ship-   )= \n32 Kat    =moth [er \n \nKat echoes mother, but staff member Mel (below) comes in, in overlap, to launch a list of \nterms which, like mother, denote family relationships:  \n11 \n \nExtract 3 \n33 Mel          [father, (.6)  husband or  [wi fe \n34 Tim                               [(network,   \n35           network-) (.)

(oo bottle)= \n55 Mel     =what else Val \n \nWhat we want to draw attention to in the extract above is Ann's contribution at line 43 \n(arrowed). So far we have seen that the care staff have initiated a discussion (to use a \nrough characterisation) of 'relationships'; Mel, prompted by one of the resident's (Kat's) \ninitial suggestion of family relationships (or relations), has been listing a series of further \nfamily roles. Val, one of the residents, has entered the spirit of the exercise and has \n12 \ncontributed aunties; this is ratified, in a confirming echo, by Mel. At various points \nanother resident, Tim, has taken turns which are difficult to hear on the tape, and have not \nbeen picked up on by the staff.  \n \nNow Ann, the other care staff member, moves the list on from family to other people \nwith relationships to the clients, saying care workers. The way she says it is in \"list \nintonation\" (see Jefferson, 1990 on using lists in interaction), showing that it disattends \nTim's turn, and is meant to add another item to the catalogue of family roles that Kat and \nMel have established and Val has extended. Val continues to list family relations after \nthis, but Ann continues the list with another apparently anomalous category: friends. In \nthe list of people who one has relationships with, then, we find \u2018care-workers\u2019 located, \napparently naturally, among family relations and friends. \n \nDifferent kinds of relationships \n \nHere we may pause, to consider the categorical connection between family member terms \nsuch as sister, father and so on (we shall get to friends in a moment), and occupational \nrole holder terms such as care worker.  Semantically, they clearly come from different \ndomains. Yet by not marking any disjunction in the developing list, Ann proposes the \nitem care worker a member of the same set as family relations.  Lists are what Sacks \nwould call \"membership categorisation devices\" (Sacks, 1992, Vol 1, Part I, lecture 6): \nways of shepherding together otherwise disparate entities according to some criterion \nwhich they have, or can be alleged to have, in common. Certainly care-workers and \nfamily members are all roles or figures in societally-sanctioned institutions. In either \ninstitution one can have a 'relationship', in some sense, with another member of the same \ngroup.  \n \nBut the two forms of institution, and the two kinds of relationship, are different in \nimportant ways. Families can be thought to be held together by ties of nature, mutual \nobligation and affection. Residential homes operate through one group of people (care \nstaff) being paid to provide support and enact policy on behalf of their employers, for the \n13 \nbenefit of those who live there. Yet Ann, by adding the word \u2018care workers\u2019 to a list so \nfar composed only of family terms, is inviting the residents to see their relation to care \nhome workers as being comparable to their relations to their family members. Moreover, \nrecall that Ann finished off the list with and friends; yet friends, even more than family \nmembers, are people one chooses, and with whom one has a relation sustained by \ndiscovered shared values and interests as well as mutual affection. In this company, care \nworker appears to be semantically out of place. \n \nWe might at this point take a short detour to set this observation about how category-\nterms change their senses according to the company they keep (for fuller accounts, see \nthe collections of work in Antaki & Widdicombe, 1998 and Hester and Housley, 2002) . \nSacks (1992, e.g. Vol 1, Part I, lecture 6; Part II lecture 7; Part III, lectures 1 and 2) notes \nthat one understands the force of a single category-term like (say) 'teacher' according to \nthe band of co-terms it is being recruited into. Thus a sentence like \"the teacher spent the \nmorning with the Year 1 students\" implies, because of the accompanying \"year 1 \nstudents\", that sense of 'teacherness' that carries with it authority over children, control, \npedagogic direction and so on. But a sentence like \"the teacher spent the morning with \nthe school inspectors\" implies that sense of teacherness which is professional, \ndocumentary and accountable; and the implications have interactional consequences. So \nfor Ann to align care worker with brother and auntie deletes the merely workaday \nfeatures of the job and implies that element of being a care worker that shares something \nwith family members (and does not share with, say, manager or cleaner). We shall say \nmore about what these features are as the interaction progresses and the theme recurs \nmore vividly. \n \nWe skip a number of turns in which the staff directly question two residents who have not \nyet spoken; one does not respond, and the other responds with talk that is apparently off-\ntopic. The staff reiterate the official, agenda-item version of the question, thus: \n \nExtract 4 \n84 Mel     sorry (.8) what was this (1.4) Natalie: (1.8)  \n14 \n85            >what do you know< about relationships come  \n86         along Nat tell me (.) you haven\u2019t spoken (.) please \n87         (.6) \n88 ?       ((belch)) \n89 ?       (ooh) \n90         (.8) \n91 Nat     >I wa\u2019< thinking= \n92 Mel     =oh (.) go:od (because) I can hear ticking \n93         (1.0) \n94 Ann    >what\u2019s your relationship< with your care-worker  \n95            Natalie. \n96         (3.5) \n97 Nat     e\u2019s er I dunno \n98         (.8) \n99 Ann    what\u2019s he there for. \n \nMel's initial, view-soliciting question is met by uncertainty, and Ann, the other staff \nmember, attends to the problem (as she has done before; see extract 1) by respecifying \nthe question at line 94. Notice that she does so in a way that although simpler for the \nresident to answer, nevertheless smuggles in a tendentious reading of the situation. She \nasks what's your relationship with your care worker?. This kind of question, because it \nallows a one -word answer (for example 'good', or 'okay') is much less demanding than \nMel's original question, which asks what do you know about relationships. In that sense, \nit is a 'repair' of a problem with the question (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000).  \n \nBut the effect is to nominate 'your care worker' as the first candidate for a relationship for \nthe resident to talk about. This re-establishes Ann's development of 'relationships' (which \nwe have seen started off as family member terms) to include occupational roles; \nmoreover, not only in the abstract, but the residents' own care-worker. In response to \nNat\u2019s answer of \u2018I dunno\u2019 to the first repair, Ann makes a second repair, respecifying the \nquestion of relationships into one of function (line 99: what's he there for). The clue to \n15 \ndescribing a relationship in this sequence, then, rests on describing the function of the \nperson. As we shall see, this becomes crucial to the later elision of \u2018care-worker\u2019 with \n\u2018friend\u2019. \n \nWhat seems to have started out, then, as a solicitation of resident's views about \n'relationships' is being steered towards a consideration of just one sort of relationship, in \nthe service of making care worker comparable to family members and friends. The \nresidents have still not fully voiced their agreement of the staff's proposition, and the \nsubject is pursued. \n \nPursuing confirmation of a particular kind of relationship \n \nThe staff member has asked the resident what her relationship is with her care worker, \nand then, to make it even more concrete, what he is there for. This process of modifying \ngeneral questions by making them more specific is one that has been noted in previous \nconversation analytic work looking at interactions with people with learning difficulties, \nand has been identified as one of the ways that people can be led towards producing \npositive statements about their lives or the services they use (Antaki 1999, 2002; \nHoutkoop-Steenstra and Antaki, 1997). In the first part of the following extract (which \ncarries on immediately form the one above) we see Natalie answer the question of \nfunction: the care worker help(s). Notice, however, how Ann redirects the direction of \nNatalie's description: \n \nExtract 5 (follows on immediately from extract 4) \n100         (.6) \n101 Kat     help \n102           (.7)    \n103 Ann    \u00b0um\u00b0 \n104         (.5)  \n105 Kat     help \n106         (.4) \n16 \n107\u2192 Ann    talk to: \n108         (.2) \n109 Nat     yes \n110         (1.3) \n111\u2192 Ann    and do you >go and talk to him\u2191< \n112         (.8) \n113 Nat     (do) you want he:r \n114         (.3) \n115 Ann    her \n116         (.2) \n117 Nat     yeah \n118         (.6) \n \nAnn suggests (line 107), in a candidate answer (Pomerantz, 1988; see also Houtkoop-\nSteenstra 2000 pp 30-31), that the care worker is someone that Natalie can talk to. Note \nthe elongated \u2018to:\u2019, a device that is commonly used in teaching or parent\/child \ninteractions to indicate the other person is expected to finish the sentence  (see, for \nexample, Edwards and Mercer, 1987)  and we might speculate the word being prompted \nhere is either \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018him\u2019. \"Someone you can talk to\" is a description that, in British \nculture at least, is often heard as warmly personal, and perhaps even non-institutional. \nOne may say that a doctor, apart from being efficient, is someone you can talk to; \nconversely, if someone is merely officious, and unable or unwilling to unbend, then \nhowever good at their job, she or he isn't someone you can talk to.  Ann is inviting \nNatalie, then, to evaluate the care worker as someone who is likeably informal - to have a \nsocial presence in her life, as well as an official one. Nat's response at line 109 is \napparently a minimal agreement; but her further response to Ann's do you go and talk to \nhim is not well formatted (line 113). Mel presses for an explicit response: \n \nExtract 6 (follows on immediately from extract 5) \n \n119 Mel     what kind of relationship do you have with her \u2193dear \n17 \n120         (1.9) \n121 Nat     alright \n122         (1.0) \n123 Mel     umm \n124         (.3) \n125 Tim      (coughs)= \n126\u2192 Nat     =(is) she (.) she\u2019s alright \n127         (.2)  \n128 Mel     she\u2019s alright= \n129 Nat     =yeah= \n130\u2192 Ann    =so she\u2019s a friend= \n \nNat twice (in lines 121 and 126) volunteers her opinion that the care worker is alright. \nThis, in British idiom, is a minimally positive assessment. Mel echoes it for confirmation \n(line 128) and Nat confirms. In a direct latch, Ann then immediately draws out the \nimplication of what Nat has said as so she's a friend.  \n \nNotice that Ann put this to Nat as a formulation (Heritage and Watson, 1979). Heritage \nand Watson note that the practice is formatted as a conversational adjacency pair, with a \npreference for agreement. That is, if one speaker formulates what has just been said \n(either by summarising the gist of it, or by  drawing out its relevant implication or upshot, \nas Ann does here), then the other speaker is expected to take the opportunity to \nacknowledge that formulation, and to ratify it.  \n \nThe point about a formulation of this sort - which is much more common in institutional \ntalk, as opposed to the egalitarian talk of ordinary conversation (Drew, 2003), is that it \ncan offer a reading which is pregnant with interpretation, and not necessarily in tune \nwith the original speaker's professed interests. Here we see Ann use it to bring out the \n(alleged) implication of the description Nat has offered: that, given what has been \nsaid, then she's a friend.  This is built to get agreement (see Sacks, 1987, on the \npreference for agreement in interaction). Not to agree with a formulation is to go \n18 \nagainst the norms of conversation, and may cause turbulence; and indeed, as we see in \nthe extract below (which carries on immediately after the one above) Natalie agrees with \nAnn's formulation. Yet what Kat had said was the minimal description that the care \nworker was alright; to infer that that meant she was a friend is remarkably tendentious. \nNevertheless, Ann agrees: \n \n \nExtract 7  (follows on immediately from extract 6) \n131    Nat     =yeah (.) \u00b0she\u2019s a [friend\u00b0 \n132 Ann                         [yeah \n133         (.5) \n134 Nat     Stacey\u2019s a friend \n135           (.2) \n136    Mel    right (.6) so er (.3) the carer the (.2) >night carer<  \n137           who comes on this evening what is she to you \n138           (1.0) \n139    Kat    h [elper \n140    Mel      [what relationship is that to you \n141           (1.2) \n142    ?      \u00b0a- e::r\u00b0 \n143    Nat    help me \n144           (.3) \n145\u2192  Mel    yeah but what do you always say (.) she is (.) my: \n146           (.3) \n147    Nat    friend \n148           (.3) \n149    Kat    friend \n \nThe last extract, above, has the final mention of institutionally-based relationships in this \nepisode. In line 136 Mel brings up a different member of staff (the night carer) and asks \nabout her relationship to Kat or Nat (both at times respond to this sequence of questions). \n19 \nKat answers \u2018helper\u2019: an institutional relationship. Mel then reformulates the question, \nindicating that the answer is inadequate. Nat tries \u2018help me\u2019, which is again treated as \ninadequate. Mel then uses a suggestive incomplete sentence what do you always say she \nis my..., elongating the final word and leaving a pause to elicit the answer. Nat, and then \nKat, come up with \u2018friend\u2019.  Once again, what was proposed by the resident has been \ntrumped by the staff, who pursue the description until it is cast as a personal, non-\ninstitutional one. \n \nIn all of this, then, we have seen staff apparently pursuing an official agenda item of \nfinding out what residents know about, and their views on, 'relationships'. In so doing, \nhowever, they have overruled the resident's assessments of care-workers in the residence, \nand substituted 'friend' for a care worker originally described merely as alright, and for a \nnight-carer originally described as helps me. Close inspection of the talk showed that they \ndid so by a subtle play of categorical terms (inserting care-worker into a list of family \nmember terms and friend), pursuit of otherwise adequate answers, and tendentiously \nformulating residents' talk. We consider the upshot of all this in the concluding section. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis article was about identities at play in a single episode of interaction between care-\nstaff and a group of people with learning disabilities. We focussed on one particular \nexchange within the episode to argue that 'disempowerment' is a danger even in what is \non the agenda is a (supposedly empowering) solicitation of residents' views. We should \nmake it clear that we do not want to single out these particular care staff personnel, nor \nimply that their conduct is uniformly negative. We mean, rather, to use them to illustrate \na standing dilemma for any institutional personnel who have to realise, in everyday \ninteraction, the aspirations of official discourse. That is the promise of case-studies of \nroutine practice. It ought to identify the workings, and the effects, of ways of working \nwhich are embedded in (but might be contradictory to) institutional normality. We \nremind the reader that we do not know how often this practice happens, nor its \n20 \ndistribution according to standard sociological or psychological factors (whether it is \nmore common among, say, more or less experienced care staff, or in more or less well \nregulated residential homes, and so on). But we can say that when it happened in this \ncase, it came off as routine; and it had the effect of ascribing a disempowered identity to \nthe people on the receiving end.  \n \nWe saw staff ascribe a disempowered identity to the residents in two ways. Neither were \nsignalled by anything so obvious as name-calling. Both were matters of the residents' \ntreatment by the staff.  \n \nThe first is revealed simply in the process of interaction, in the ways in which turns are \ntaken, troubles signalled and so on. What we see is that the staff direct the interaction \ntowards certain statements, signal when a resident\u2019s utterance is a source of trouble and \nlead the residents to producing particular types of statements. All this is manifest in the \nuse of answer pursuits, candidate answers, leading sentences with one word missing, \nformulations and so on. In doing so, the identities of the residents as incompetent and \ndependent, and the identities of the staff as knowledgeable and as in charge are acted out \nin the moment-by-moment details of the interaction. It might be argued that here we see \nthe bald operation of power: it is the staff who control the interaction and its outcome, \nand judge whether an utterance is adequate or not, even though the agenda item they are \nfollowing mandates them to find out the residents' views. The content of the discussion is \nalmost irrelevant here \u2013 it is in the process that relationships and identities are enacted. \nThe process of the group discussion, then, while meant to empower the residents by \nencouraging them to speak up, disempowers them and treats them as deficient \u2013 people to \nbe coached \u2013 thus reinforcing impairment models of the identity of people with learning \ndisabilities. Note that they do this in similar ways, using similar conversational forms, to \nthose that have been observed in other services and with other interactants since the first \nclose inspection of such talk (Markov\u00e1, 1991), so we have some confidence that this is a \nmore general phenomenon that can happen in services for people with learning \ndisabilities. These findings fit into the social model of disability (Oliver, 1990), which \n21 \nclaims that there is a distinction between impairment and the way society and its \ninstitutions disables people through its reactions to impairment.  \n \nThe second way in which identity became an issue is, we think, more subtle and \ninteresting. It is revealed in the interplay between the staff's account of the identities of \nthird parties, not present in the interaction and the implied identities of the residents to \nwhom the staff are talking. The staff worked to set (non-present)  'care-workers' in a \ncollection of person categories including friends and family members. That collection \nwas meant to coach the residents in who they ought to count as their friends. But \ncoaching someone implies that they need coaching, and the content of the instructions \nreveals the nature of the deficit they are supposed to suffer. In effect, the staff treated the \nresidents as having an identity impaired in its powers of basic social discrimination. They \nare treated as being unable to tell who their friends were, and being in need of having to \ncount care-staff among them.  \n \nRecall that, according to the key Department of Health document, Valuing People (2001), \npeople with learning disabilities are to be accorded ordinary rights. With regard to \nrelationships, this includes \"the right to a decent education, to grow up \nto vote, to marry and have a family, and to express their opinions, with \nhelp and support to do so where necessary.\" (Department of Health, 2001, p XX; \nemphasis added). If they have the right to marry, then, a fortiori, they have the right to \nknow and choose their friends.  \n \nWe must ask what functions it might serve an institution to have people publicly state \nthat a staff member is their friend rather than their carer (or indeed their teacher, their \nprotector, their servant, or their advocate, to list other possible institutional roles). As we \nnoted above when discussing CA's analysis of category terms and their implications \n(Sacks 1992), to specify a category is also to specify imply roles, hierarchies, obligations, \nand repertoires of behaviour. The identity of \u2018friend\u2019 might imply a range of things such \nas equality, mutual support, enjoyment of each others company, familiarity, ease of social \ninteraction, and absence of ulterior motives. When one acts for a friend, the moral order \n22 \nrequires we try to act in their best interests. Each of these associations answers a problem \nfor a residential institution, and each overcomes alternative constructions of the \nrelationship (and therefore identity) between staff member and resident. \n  \nWhy might it be desirable for a residential home to construct staff\/service-user \nrelationships in terms of friendships? Firstly such a construction implies happy people, a \nlack of conflict between staff and residents, and a harmonious social environment. This \nover-rides more difficult negotiations about relations between those paid by the state of a \nnon-governmental organisation and accountable to those bodies, and those they are there \nto support, and in particular the issue of power and control. If staff are constructed as \nacting on the basis of friendship, then their motivations, and loyalties, are not brought \ninto question. Secondly, it implies an equality in the humanity of the service-user and the \nstaff. This is just and right, and negates stigmatizing conclusions which are always latent \nin social constructions of people with learning disabilities, but the danger, as we have \nseen, is that it becomes \u2018lip service\u2019 if it obscures the ways in which identities are \nactually enacted. \n \nOverall, we might see, in this single case study, the operation of the dilemma between \ncare and control that is well-known to students of the caring professions, but given \nspecific discursive form. It is a standing danger for any institution that its official account \nof the people with whom it works may not be consistently respected in its officials' \nroutine day-today dealings with them. As we have seen here, even in ostensible \nempowering guidance on relationships may, under pressure to reach interactional goals of \nclosure, result in the attribution of people with learning disabilities with an unwarrantedly \nlimited social identity. \n \n23 \nReferences \n \nAmerican Association on Mental Retardation (1992).

We explore a case in which care staff \nare in the process of soliciting residents' views on 'relationships'. Ostensibly, this is an \nempowering part of a group meeting, meant to help the residents understand their \nrelationships with the people around them, and to value those which are positive. \nHowever, the talks mutates from solicitation to instruction and, in doing so, provides a \nvivid case of people with learning disabilities being attributed social rights more limited \nthan is consistent with institutional service policy. We unpack the play of category \nmembership in this episode to illustrate how conflicting agendas can lead to the \nconstruction, even in ostensibly empowering encounters, of identities actively disavowed \nat the level of official discourse. \n \nDeleted: n\n* Document showing textual changes\n2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn one sense, the 'identity' of being intellectually impaired is an official cover-sheet \ndiagnostic fact, recorded on documents. According to the definitions used by authorities \nsuch as British Psychological Society (2001), the American Association on Mental \nRetardation (1992) and the American Psychiatric Association (1994), to diagnose \nsomeone as having a learning disability (or mental retardation, in North American usage) \nis to diagnose them as having a low IQ and to have what is called poor 'social \/ adaptive \nfunctioning'. However, social policy has to go beyond diagnosis, and prescribe what \nsociety must do. In the modern discourse of social policy, the person with learning \ndisabilities is not merely someone with cognitive limitations, but someone with rights. As \nthe UK Department of Health puts it, in a key policy document: \n \n4.1 People with learning disabilities currently have little control over \ntheir own lives, though almost all, including the most severely disabled, \nare capable of making choices and expressing their views and \npreferences. The current problems are:  Services have been too slow to \nrecognise that people with learning disabilities have rights like other \ncitizens .... [list continues] (Valuing People, Chapter 4, p 44) \n \nThe question for service providers (such as, in Britain, the National Health Service) is, \nhow are those rights to be acknowledged, and, indeed, promoted? There is a potential \ndilemma at the actual level of everyday social interaction between service providers and \npeople with learning disabilities (henceforth, LD). On the one hand,  service providers \nought to orient to the official, diagnostic features of having LD: delayed comprehension, \nlimited memory span and the difficulties in social\/adaptive skills that are supposed to \nfollow from these cognitive impairments. A member of care staff, for example, acting \nwithin the official designation of the intellectual limits of the person with LD, might \npermissibly (or necessarily) speak to them slowly, less abstractly, and so forth. Indeed, \nliterature on interviewing people with learning disabilities often recommends such \nDeleted: do: and, in\n3 \napproaches (e.g. Finlay & Lyons, 2001; Prosser & Bromley, 1998). On the other hand - \nand this may be a conflict - the service provider ought to respect and promote the \nindividual's rights: to personal choice, views and preferences, as the official discourse has \nit (see the extract from Valuing People, above). \n \nBut it is a matter of ordinary observation to say that those who talk to people with \nlearning disabilities often modify what they say, and how they say it, in ways that seem \nintuitively to assume a greater degree of impairment, and across a broader range of areas \nof life, than is necessary (this has been termed a \u2018deficiency perspective\u2019 \u2013 Booth & \nBooth, 1994; or a \u2018deficit intervention\u2019 - Goodley, 2000). Some of these ways of talking \nimply that the person with learning disabilities has reduced rights to choose, express a \npreference or have a view. That is to imply an 'identity', just as much (or perhaps more) \nthan does the explicit naming as 'deficient', 'retarded' and so on. Such terms are, in \nthemselves, neutral. Indeed, historically they were a welcome replacement of a previous \ngeneration of terms like \"cretinous\", \"imbecilic\" and the like.  For an individual on the \nreceiving end, the descriptive term on his or her case-notes is less important than the \ntreatment they get from the people around them.  \n \nIf that treatment presumes deficiency, that might be rationalised within a medical model \nof disability as nothing more than a realistic appraisal of the consequences of the person's \ncognitive or linguistic limitations. However, social models of disability (e.g. Goodley, \n2000; Oliver, 1990) alert us to the ways in which social processes and even the \ninstitutions developed to support disabled people can further disable. \n \n It is here that the flexibility of the second aspect of the diagnostic criteria becomes \nimportant; recall that people with learning disabilities are identified in part by a \nmeasurable impairment in \"social and\/or adaptive functioning\". The British \nPsychological Society defines this as the individual requiring \u201csignificant assistance to \nprovide for his\/her own survival \u2026. and\/or with his\/her social\/community adaptation \n(e.g. social problem solving, and social reasoning)\u201d (British Psychological Society, 2001, \np.6). But this assistance, and the 'adaptation' it is meant to provide for, has to be realised \nDeleted: Within\nDeleted: such presumption might be \nrationalized\n4 \nin actual interaction. It is at the interface of rights and self-determination, on the one \nhand, and assumptions of impairment in comprehension and social awareness and \nreasoning on the other, where we would expect to see delicate (and indelicate) identity-\nbased negotiations occur between people with learning disabilities and others. \n \nThis suggests, we think, that a close study of language in interaction will add to our \nunderstanding of intellectual impairment, at least if we are interested in how the \nintellectually impaired person navigates through the world. Analysis of how such a \nperson is talked to will show up what the reports of people with learning disabilities \nthemselves suggests - that the 'identity problem' for people with LD happens when they're \nattributed with deficiencies well beyond memory limitations, speech production \ndifficulties and so forth, and when these attributions have implications for their social \nrights  (for examples, see Bogdan & Taylor, 1994; Finlay & Lyons, 2005; Goodley, \n2000). \n \nIdentities in theory and in practice \nWe shall be looking, then, at talk, and how a speaker - even one who is institutionally \ncommitted to a progressive social services policy - might set the person with LD in a \nworld more restricted than would be defensible on the basis of their official intellectual \ndiagnosis. The  broader context is the observation that there are potential sources of \ndifficulty in the social relationships between people with learning disabilities and the staff \nwho are paid to support them. Identities and their associated rights can be conceived as \nboth ideologically mandated (in such discourses as 'mission statements', white papers, \nformal agendas and other instruments which embody social policy) and discursively \nproduced (in the turn-by-turn architecture of talk), with the possibility of inconsistency, \nand indeed contradiction, between the two.  \n \nIn the data we shall be examining, we illustrate how in these two identities - the \ntheoretical and the actual - might conflict. That is, the identities being discursively \nproduced might contradict those that are being ostensibly promoted in the situation. This \npossibility is an important one to acknowledge in public services, where official service \n5 \nphilosophies and policies encourage the expression of particular, empowered identities \nand outcomes, as advocated in \u2018person-centred\u2019 approaches (Department of Health, \n2001). Here we might find \u2018lip service\u2019 being paid to the philosophy, while actual \npractice, the enactment of identities and relationships, remains unaffected. Exploring this \ninterplay of identities, then, has the potential to inform the social model of disability, \nparticularly in its attempts to understand how medical\/impairment models of disability \nmight persist despite changes in the discursive content of services.  \n \nThe particular episode we describe involves members of care-staff ostensibly seeking the \nviews of residents with LD about their relationships; and ending up (as we shall argue) \ncoaching the residents in who it is that they may (or ought to) call 'their friend'. Coaching \npeople about who their friends are is a delicate business, fraught with implications about \nthe competence as social beings. Our analysis tries to bring out how, in what they say and \ndo, the care staff cast the residents into a social identity with defective social rights. \n \nIt is important to say at the outset that what the reader will find here is a case-study. We \nwant to examine, in detail, one case of how a thoroughly routine piece of business \nimposes a flawed identity onto persons with an intellectual disability. Case-studies reveal \nand explicate, but they are not surveys. We cannot say how often cases like this happen, \nnor speculate why it happened here, in the sense of psychological motivation. This is a \nsingle incident, in one group meeting, in one residential home. That the conduct of the \nmeeting it is utterly routine - in the sense that no-one in the episode seems surprised, or \nput out, by what happens - suggests at least that what we see is something within the \nrange of normal practice; and what we shall see is how there can be (presumably \nunwanted) disempowering categorisation even in interactions between care staff and \nresidents which are intended to be educative and empowering.  \n \n \nConversation Analysis \n \nDeleted: To be sure, this is a single \nincident, in one group meeting, in one \nresidential home.Nevertheless it allows us\nDeleted: We cannot provide a survey of \nhow often this happens,\nDeleted: motivation; but what we can \ndo is show\n6 \nTo get a sound grip on what speakers are doing with their talk, we use the accumulated \nconceptual apparatus of Conversation Analysis (henceforth, CA), which promises to \nreveal how social action is achieved through the medium of talk in interaction. In the \nforty years since the pioneering work of the group around Harvey Sacks (whose lectures \nwere published posthumously as Sacks, 1992),  CA has developed into a \nmultidisciplinary enterprise attracting sociologists, linguists and psychologists, among \nothers (for a sense of CA's beginnings, see Sacks, 1992; for overviews of its methods and \nstyle, see Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998, and for a comparison with other forms of \ndiscourse analysis, Wooffitt 2005).  Within the field of research on learning disability, \nCA has been used to study the communicative competence of people with a learning \ndisability (e.g. Wootton, 1989), the practices of their assessment (e.g. Antaki, 1999), the \nmanner in which they manage their identities in interviews (e.g. Rapley, Kiernan and \nAntaki, 1998), and the way they are referred to in case worker consultations (Wareing \nand Newell, 2005) among other topics. \n \nThe signal characteristics of CA are a reliance on recorded data which can be minutely \ninspected; and an openness to the way the participants in a scene display their own \nunderstandings of what they are doing and saying, including the identities they attribute \nto themselves and others. The theoretical perspective of CA on identities is that they \nshould not be researched as if they were pre-given and enduring, but rather as they come \nup, and are used, in interaction. As Antaki and Widdicombe (1998) put it, taking up the \nthread of CA work since Sacks (1992): \n \n\"...a person's identity is their display of, or ascription to, membership of \nsome social category, with consequences for the interaction in which the \ndisplay or ascription takes place. [...] Membership of a category is ascribed \n(and rejected), avowed (and disavowed) and displayed (and ignored) in local \nplaces and at certain times, and it does these things as part of the \ninteractional work that constitutes people's lives.\" [Antaki and Widdicombe \n1998, p 2; emphasis added] \n \n7 \nIt is important to be clear that we shall see, in the data we analyse, identity-ascription \n'doing interactional work' in two distinct ways. One is in how staff talk about third \nparties. That is, how they instruct residents in what kind of person it is who must be \nincluded in the identity-category of 'friend'. The other is in the staff's implicit \nconstruction, by this very act of coaching, of the identities of the residents themselves. \n \nAn explicit note is in order on the very notion of 'disabled identities'. The reader will not \nsee anyone in these data, explicitly call another person 'disabled' or use any more or less \npolite alternative (say, 'intellectually challenged' or 'retarded') still less an offensive one \n('cretin', 'mongol' and the like). Certainly that happens in other times and places, and it is \nfair then to say that one has seen someone being ascribed an 'disabled identity'. But \nidentity ascription is more subtle and pervasive. It is very important for our argument that \nsomeone can be ascribed a disabled identity not just by naming but being treated as \ndisabled. \n \nTo see how that treatment cashes out, we shall be mobilising CA's observation that it a \nspeaker can ascribe an identity by, as it were, 'hinting' (see, for example Sacks on the \nconceptual apparatus required to permit such things as a reference to being a 'hair stylist' \nto be, at least in the time he was writing,  an  index of sexual orientation; Sacks, 1992, \nVol 1 Part I, lecture 6). We shall see two main ways of hinting (or of exploiting the \ncategory-bound features of an identity category, to use more technical terminology) and it \nmay help orient the reader if we prefigure the analysis in outline. We shall be looking at \ntalk among  members of staff who are facilitating a routine discussion among a group of \nresidents who have learning difficulties. First we shall see that the facilitators of the \ngroup suggest to their learning-disabled residents, in a discussion of 'relationships', that \nthe category 'care worker' belongs naturally in among a the categories 'family members \nand friends'. That is identity-work in its own right, but seemingly concerns the identity of \ncare workers - what implication does it have for the listening learning-disabled residents? \nIt has an indirect, but powerful implication for the hearers' identity. They are being \ntreated as folk for whom the 'natural' boundaries between  professional staff and intimate \nfamily and friends does not obtain: the residents are too 'disabled' to enjoy the distinction. \nDeleted: parties: specifically,\nDeleted: make our case\nDeleted: is not only outright naming \nthat categorises someone;\nDeleted: There are\nDeleted: terminology), which coincide \nwith the two analyses which we describe. \nThe first that we shall see in these data is \nto set a\nDeleted: category of person (in the case \nwe shall be seeing, 'care worker') in \namong a group of other person-categories \n(in this case, 'family members') and thus \nhint or imply that they share some sort of \nidentity. The second is more direct: to \ntreat someone (in this case, the residents \nwith LD)\n8 \nThe second is more direct. It is to treat the residents as not being able to form their own \nsense about who their friends are, and whose feelings ('natural' in anyone else) have to be \nexplicitly coached.  \n \n \nData and Analysis \n \nOur data come from a residents\u2019 meeting recently held in a residential home in Britain1. \nAccording to the manager of the home, the aims of these meetings were to empower \nclients, to discuss day-to-day concerns that residents may have had, and to offer a social \nvenue to facilitate group interaction and communication. Other staff members saw the \nmeetings as providing an opportunity for residents to have a say in the running of the \nhome, to air their grievances, and to contribute to planning future activities. The meetings \nwere also used for instructional purposes. In the meeting we examine, the staff members \nhad the following (pre-written) agenda items in their hands: do we all know what to do in \ncase of fire?; ask clients where are the fire points?; ask clients what they would do in case \nof fire; update clients with the procedures for night and day. The meetings were attended \nby the residents of the home and whichever staff were on duty at the time. Two staff \nmembers and eight residents were present at the meeting we discuss here. Personal and \nplace names, and other identifying details, have been changed. \n \nThe talk we shall discuss comes some 13 minutes into the session. The pre-written \nagenda item reads as follows: the Day Centre is doing a course on relationships - ask \nclients what is a relationship, in their view; ask clients what they know of relationships. \nAn official characterisation  of this episode of the group meeting would be that the staff \nmembers are pursuing the institutional goal of encouraging discussion and instructing the \nresidents in 'relationships', presumably with the aim of increasing their understanding of \nthe term so that they are better able to describe their social situation and, perhaps, \nimprove it.   \n \n                                                \n1  We are grateful to Treena Jingree for access to these data \nDeleted: judgement\n9 \nOur extract starts with \"Melanie\", one of the two staff members present, introducing the \ntopic thus : Right, d\u2019you all know what relationships are? This is initially met with \nsilence, until the other staff member \"Ann\" rephrases the topic as a question and directs it \n(line 3) at a particular resident. (Notation, which attempts to approximate the way the \nspeakers delivered their words, is explained in Appendix 1. A continuous transcript of the \nepisode can be found in Appendix 2.) \n \n \nExtract 1 \n01 Mel     right (.7) >d\u2019you all know what< relationships are \n02         (1.2)   \n03 Ann    Kelly (.8) what\u2019s a relation[ship \n04    Tim                              [(      [    ) \n05\u2192 Kat                                   [cousins= \n06    Ann     =don\u2019t know \n07            (.4) \n08 Mel     yes \n09 ?

They \nare both types of \u2018relationships\u2019 but also \u2018relations\u2019, a contraction of the word \n\u2018relationships\u2019 (note that there is overlapping talk which begins half way through the \nword \u2018relationships\u2019 on line 3). The arrowed lines signal her contributions of cousins, \nniece and uncle. It is important that we establish this, as later we shall see that the \nresidents' competence in knowing what relationships they have, and being able to given \nthem a proper name, is precisely what becomes an issue.  \n \nWhat is 'a relationship'? \n \nThe next extract, which follows on immediately, shows that Tim is says he doesn't know, \nbut Kat's answer in terms of family relationships is indeed acceptable to the staff: Mel \nexplicitly instructs Tim that it can be your mother. \n \nExtract 2 \n22    Ann    =yeah what\u2019s a relationship= \n23 ?      =hoo (bit obvious) \n24        (.5) \n25 Tim   dunno what it is[     no \n26 Ann                 [(sighs) \n27        (.2) \n28 Kat    eh \n29        (.) \n30 Mel    It can be your moth [er:, \n31 Tim                    [(r'ship-   )= \n32 Kat    =moth [er \n \nKat echoes mother, but staff member Mel (below) comes in, in overlap, to launch a list of \nterms which, like mother, denote family relationships:  \n11 \n \nExtract 3 \n33 Mel          [father, (.6)  husband or  [wi fe \n34 Tim                               [(network,   \n35           network-) (.)

(oo bottle)= \n55 Mel     =what else Val \n \nWhat we want to draw attention to in the extract above is Ann's contribution at line 43 \n(arrowed). So far we have seen that the care staff have initiated a discussion (to use a \nrough characterisation) of 'relationships'; Mel, prompted by one of the resident's (Kat's) \ninitial suggestion of family relationships (or relations), has been listing a series of further \nfamily roles. Val, one of the residents, has entered the spirit of the exercise and has \n12 \ncontributed aunties; this is ratified, in a confirming echo, by Mel. At various points \nanother resident, Tim, has taken turns which are difficult to hear on the tape, and have not \nbeen picked up on by the staff.  \n \nNow Ann, the other care staff member, moves the list on from family to other people \nwith relationships to the clients, saying care workers. The way she says it is in \"list \nintonation\" (see Jefferson, 1990 on using lists in interaction), showing that it disattends \nTim's turn, and is meant to add another item to the catalogue of family roles that Kat and \nMel have established and Val has extended. Val continues to list family relations after \nthis, but Ann continues the list with another apparently anomalous category: friends. In \nthe list of people who one has relationships with, then, we find \u2018care-workers\u2019 located, \napparently naturally, among family relations and friends. \n \nDifferent kinds of relationships \n \nHere we may pause, to consider the categorical connection between family member terms \nsuch as sister, father and so on (we shall get to friends in a moment), and occupational \nrole holder terms such as care worker.  Semantically, they clearly come from different \ndomains. Yet by not marking any disjunction in the developing list, Ann proposes the \nitem care worker a member of the same set as family relations.  Lists are what Sacks \nwould call \"membership categorisation devices\" (Sacks, 1992, Vol 1, Part I, lecture 6): \nways of shepherding together otherwise disparate entities according to some criterion \nwhich they have, or can be alleged to have, in common. Certainly care-workers and \nfamily members are all roles or figures in societally-sanctioned institutions. In either \ninstitution one can have a 'relationship', in some sense, with another member of the same \ngroup.  \n \nBut the two forms of institution, and the two kinds of relationship, are different in \nimportant ways. Families can be thought to be held together by ties of nature, mutual \nobligation and affection. Residential homes operate through one group of people (care \nstaff) being paid to provide support and enact policy on behalf of their employers, for the \n13 \nbenefit of those who live there. Yet Ann, by adding the word \u2018care workers\u2019 to a list so \nfar composed only of family terms, is inviting the residents to see their relation to care \nhome workers as being comparable to their relations to their family members. Moreover, \nrecall that Ann finished off the list with and friends; yet friends, even more than family \nmembers, are people one chooses, and with whom one has a relation sustained by \ndiscovered shared values and interests as well as mutual affection. In this company, care \nworker appears to be semantically out of place. \n \nWe might at this point take a short detour to set this observation about how category-\nterms change their senses according to the company they keep (for fuller accounts, see \nthe collections of work in Antaki & Widdicombe, 1998 and Hester and Housley, 2002) . \nSacks (1992, e.g. Vol 1, Part I, lecture 6; Part II lecture 7; Part III, lectures 1 and 2) notes \nthat one understands the force of a single category-term like (say) 'teacher' according to \nthe band of co-terms it is being recruited into. Thus a sentence like \"the teacher spent the \nmorning with the Year 1 students\" implies, because of the accompanying \"year 1 \nstudents\", that sense of 'teacherness' that carries with it authority over children, control, \npedagogic direction and so on. But a sentence like \"the teacher spent the morning with \nthe school inspectors\" implies that sense of teacherness which is professional, \ndocumentary and accountable; and the implications have interactional consequences. So \nfor Ann to align care worker with brother and auntie deletes the merely workaday \nfeatures of the job and implies that element of being a care worker that shares something \nwith family members (and does not share with, say, manager or cleaner). We shall say \nmore about what these features are as the interaction progresses and the theme recurs \nmore vividly. \n \nWe skip a number of turns in which the staff directly question two residents who have not \nyet spoken; one does not respond, and the other responds with talk that is apparently off-\ntopic. The staff reiterate the official, agenda-item version of the question, thus: \n \nExtract 4 \n84 Mel     sorry (.8) what was this (1.4) Natalie: (1.8)  \n14 \n85            >what do you know< about relationships come  \n86         along Nat tell me (.) you haven\u2019t spoken (.) please \n87         (.6) \n88 ?       ((belch)) \n89 ?       (ooh) \n90         (.8) \n91 Nat     >I wa\u2019< thinking= \n92 Mel     =oh (.) go:od (because) I can hear ticking \n93         (1.0) \n94 Ann    >what\u2019s your relationship< with your care-worker  \n95            Natalie. \n96         (3.5) \n97 Nat     e\u2019s er I dunno \n98         (.8) \n99 Ann    what\u2019s he there for. \n \nMel's initial, view-soliciting question is met by uncertainty, and Ann, the other staff \nmember, attends to the problem (as she has done before; see extract 1) by respecifying \nthe question at line 94. Notice that she does so in a way that although simpler for the \nresident to answer, nevertheless smuggles in a tendentious reading of the situation. She \nasks what's your relationship with your care worker?. This kind of question, because it \nallows a one -word answer (for example 'good', or 'okay') is much less demanding than \nMel's original question, which asks what do you know about relationships. In that sense, \nit is a 'repair' of a problem with the question (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000).  \n \nBut the effect is to nominate 'your care worker' as the first candidate for a relationship for \nthe resident to talk about. This re-establishes Ann's development of 'relationships' (which \nwe have seen started off as family member terms) to include occupational roles; \nmoreover, not only in the abstract, but the residents' own care-worker. In response to \nNat\u2019s answer of \u2018I dunno\u2019 to the first repair, Ann makes a second repair, respecifying the \nquestion of relationships into one of function (line 99: what's he there for). The clue to \nDeleted: situation: she\n15 \ndescribing a relationship in this sequence, then, rests on describing the function of the \nperson. As we shall see, this becomes crucial to the later elision of \u2018care-worker\u2019 with \n\u2018friend\u2019. \n \nWhat seems to have started out, then, as a solicitation of resident's views about \n'relationships' is being steered towards a consideration of just one sort of relationship, in \nthe service of making care worker comparable to family members and friends. The \nresidents have still not fully voiced their agreement of the staff's proposition, and the \nsubject is pursued. \n \nPursuing confirmation of a particular kind of relationship \n \nThe staff member has asked the resident what her relationship is with her care worker, \nand then, to make it even more concrete, what he is there for. This process of modifying \ngeneral questions by making them more specific is one that has been noted in previous \nconversation analytic work looking at interactions with people with learning difficulties, \nand has been identified as one of the ways that people can be led towards producing \npositive statements about their lives or the services they use (Antaki 1999, 2002; \nHoutkoop-Steenstra and Antaki, 1997). In the first part of the following extract (which \ncarries on immediately form the one above) we see Natalie answer the question of \nfunction: the care worker help(s). Notice, however, how Ann redirects the direction of \nNatalie's description: \n \nExtract 5 (follows on immediately from extract 4) \n100         (.6) \n101 Kat     help \n102           (.7)    \n103 Ann    \u00b0um\u00b0 \n104         (.5)  \n105 Kat     help \n106         (.4) \nDeleted: proposition:\n16 \n107\u2192 Ann    talk to: \n108         (.2) \n109 Nat     yes \n110         (1.3) \n111\u2192 Ann    and do you >go and talk to him\u2191< \n112         (.8) \n113 Nat     (do) you want he:r \n114         (.3) \n115 Ann    her \n116         (.2) \n117 Nat     yeah \n118         (.6) \n \nAnn suggests (line 107), in a candidate answer (Pomerantz, 1988; see also Houtkoop-\nSteenstra 2000 pp 30-31), that the care worker is someone that Natalie can talk to. Note \nthe elongated \u2018to:\u2019, a device that is commonly used in teaching or parent\/child \ninteractions to indicate the other person is expected to finish the sentence  (see, for \nexample, Edwards and Mercer, 1987)  and we might speculate the word being prompted \nhere is either \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018him\u2019. \"Someone you can talk to\" is a description that, in British \nculture at least, is often heard as warmly personal, and perhaps even non-institutional. \nOne may say that a doctor, apart from being efficient, is someone you can talk to; \nconversely, if someone is merely officious, and unable or unwilling to unbend, then \nhowever good at their job, she or he isn't someone you can talk to.  Ann is inviting \nNatalie, then, to evaluate the care worker as someone who is likeably informal - to have a \nsocial presence in her life, as well as an official one. Nat's response at line 109 is \napparently a minimal agreement; but her further response to Ann's do you go and talk to \nhim is not well formatted (line 113). Mel presses for an explicit response: \n \nExtract 6 (follows on immediately from extract 5) \n \n119 Mel     what kind of relationship do you have with her \u2193dear \n17 \n120         (1.9) \n121 Nat     alright \n122         (1.0) \n123 Mel     umm \n124         (.3) \n125 Tim      (coughs)= \n126\u2192 Nat     =(is) she (.) she\u2019s alright \n127         (.2)  \n128 Mel     she\u2019s alright= \n129 Nat     =yeah= \n130\u2192 Ann    =so she\u2019s a friend= \n \nNat twice (in lines 121 and 126) volunteers her opinion that the care worker is alright. \nThis, in British idiom, is a minimally positive assessment. Mel echoes it for confirmation \n(line 128) and Nat confirms. In a direct latch, Ann then immediately draws out the \nimplication of what Nat has said as so she's a friend.  \n \nNotice that Ann put this to Nat as a formulation (Heritage and Watson, 1979). Heritage \nand Watson note that the practice is formatted as a conversational adjacency pair, with a \npreference for agreement. That is, if one speaker formulates what has just been said \n(either by summarising the gist of it, or by  drawing out its relevant implication or upshot, \nas Ann does here), then the other speaker is expected to take the opportunity to \nacknowledge that formulation, and to ratify it.  \n \nThe point about a formulation of this sort - which is much more common in institutional \ntalk, as opposed to the egalitarian talk of ordinary conversation (Drew, 2003), is that it \ncan offer a reading which is pregnant with interpretation, and not necessarily in tune \nwith the original speaker's professed interests. Here we see Ann use it to bring out the \n(alleged) implication of the description Nat has offered: that, given what has been \nsaid, then she's a friend.  This is built to get agreement (see Sacks, 1987, on the \npreference for agreement in interaction). Not to agree with a formulation is to go \nDeleted: Ann\n18 \nagainst the norms of conversation, and may cause turbulence; and indeed, as we see in \nthe extract below (which carries on immediately after the one above) Natalie agrees with \nAnn's formulation. Yet what Kat had said was the minimal description that the care \nworker was alright; to infer that that meant she was a friend is remarkably tendentious. \nNevertheless, Ann agrees: \n \n \nExtract 7  (follows on immediately from extract 6) \n131    Nat     =yeah (.) \u00b0she\u2019s a [friend\u00b0 \n132 Ann                         [yeah \n133         (.5) \n134 Nat     Stacey\u2019s a friend \n135           (.2) \n136    Mel    right (.6) so er (.3) the carer the (.2) >night carer<  \n137           who comes on this evening what is she to you \n138           (1.0) \n139    Kat    h [elper \n140    Mel      [what relationship is that to you \n141           (1.2) \n142    ?      \u00b0a- e::r\u00b0 \n143    Nat    help me \n144           (.3) \n145\u2192  Mel    yeah but what do you always say (.) she is (.) my: \n146           (.3) \n147    Nat    friend \n148           (.3) \n149    Kat    friend \n \nThe last extract, above, has the final mention of institutionally-based relationships in this \nepisode. In line 136 Mel brings up a different member of staff (the night carer) and asks \nabout her relationship to Kat or Nat (both at times respond to this sequence of questions). \n19 \nKat answers \u2018helper\u2019: an institutional relationship. Mel then reformulates the question, \nindicating that the answer is inadequate. Nat tries \u2018help me\u2019, which is again treated as \ninadequate. Mel then uses a suggestive incomplete sentence what do you always say she \nis my..., elongating the final word and leaving a pause to elicit the answer. Nat, and then \nKat, come up with \u2018friend\u2019.  Once again, what was proposed by the resident has been \ntrumped by the staff, who pursue the description until it is cast as a personal, non-\ninstitutional one. \n \nIn all of this, then, we have seen staff apparently pursuing an official agenda item of \nfinding out what residents know about, and their views on, 'relationships'. In so doing, \nhowever, they have overruled the resident's assessments of care-workers in the residence, \nand substituted 'friend' for a care worker originally described merely as alright, and for a \nnight-carer originally described as helps me. Close inspection of the talk showed that they \ndid so by a subtle play of categorical terms (inserting care-worker into a list of family \nmember terms and friend), pursuit of otherwise adequate answers, and tendentiously \nformulating residents' talk. We consider the upshot of all this in the concluding section. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis article was about identities at play in a single episode of interaction between care-\nstaff and a group of people with learning disabilities. We focussed on one particular \nexchange within the episode to argue that 'disempowerment' is a danger even in what is \non the agenda is a solicitation of residents' views. We should make it clear that we do not \nwant to single out these particular care staff personnel, nor imply that their conduct is \nuniformly negative. We mean, rather, to use them to illustrate a standing dilemma for any \ninstitutional personnel who have to realise, in everyday interaction, the aspirations of \nofficial discourse. That is the promise of case-studies of routine practice. It ought to \nidentify the workings, and the effects, of ways of working which are embedded in (but \nmight be contradictory to) institutional normality. We remind the reader that we do not \nknow how often this practice happens, nor its distribution according to standard \nDeleted: discourse.\u00b6\n20 \nsociological or psychological factors (whether it is more common among, say, more or \nless experienced care staff, or in more or less well regulated residential homes, and so \non). But we can say that when it happened in this case, it came off as routine; and it had \nthe effect of ascribing a disempowered identity to the people on the receiving end.  \n \nWe saw staff ascribe a disempowered identity to the residents in two ways. Neither were \nsignalled by anything so obvious as name-calling. Both were matters of the residents' \ntreatment by the staff.  \n \nThe first is revealed simply in the process of interaction, in the ways in which turns are \ntaken, troubles signalled and so on. What we see is that the staff direct the interaction \ntowards certain statements, signal when a resident\u2019s utterance is a source of trouble and \nlead the residents to producing particular types of statements. All this is manifest in the \nuse of answer pursuits, candidate answers, leading sentences with one word missing, \nformulations and so on. In doing so, the identities of the residents as incompetent and \ndependent, and the identities of the staff as knowledgeable and as in charge are acted out \nin the moment-by-moment details of the interaction. It might be argued that here we see \nthe bald operation of power: it is the staff who control the interaction and its outcome, \nand judge whether an utterance is adequate or not, even though the agenda item they are \nfollowing mandates them to find out the residents' views. The content of the discussion is \nalmost irrelevant here \u2013 it is in the process that relationships and identities are enacted. \nThe process of the group discussion, then, while meant to empower the residents by \nencouraging them to speak up, disempowers them and treats them as deficient \u2013 people to \nbe coached \u2013 thus reinforcing impairment models of the identity of people with learning \ndisabilities. Note that they do this in similar ways, using similar conversational forms, to \nthose that have been observed in other services and with other interactants since the first \nclose inspection of such talk (Markov\u00e1, 1991), so we have some confidence that this is a \nmore general phenomenon that can happen in services for people with learning \ndisabilities. These findings fit into the social model of disability (Oliver, 1990), which \nclaims that there is a distinction between impairment and the way society and its \ninstitutions disables people through its reactions to impairment.  \nDeleted: Identities, and their \nconcomitant rights, can be seen to be at \nstake in two ways in this sequence. \nDeleted: those interactants employed as\nDeleted: in the service\nDeleted: This can be seen\nDeleted: \u00b6\n\u00b6\n21 \n \nThe second way in which identity became an issue is, we think, more subtle and \ninteresting. It is revealed in the interplay between the staff's account of the identities of \nthird parties, not present in the interaction and the implied identities of the residents to \nwhom the staff are talking. The staff worked to set (non-present)  'care-workers' in a \ncollection of person categories including friends and family members. That collection \nwas meant to coach the residents in who they ought to count as their friends. But \ncoaching someone implies that they need coaching, and the content of the instructions \nreveals the nature of the deficit they are supposed to suffer. In effect, the staff treated the \nresidents as having an identity impaired in its powers of basic social discrimination. They \nare treated as being unable to tell who their friends were, and being in need of having to \ncount care-staff among them.  \n \nRecall that, according to the key Department of Health document, Valuing People (2001), \npeople with learning disabilities are to be accorded ordinary rights. With regard to \nrelationships, this includes \"the right to a decent education, to grow up \nto vote, to marry and have a family, and to express their opinions, with \nhelp and support to do so where necessary.\" (Department of Health, 2001, p XX; \nemphasis added). If they have the right to marry, then, a fortiori, they have the right to \nknow and choose their friends.  \n \nWe must ask what functions it might serve an institution to have people publicly state \nthat a staff member is their friend rather than their carer (or indeed their teacher, their \nprotector, their servant, or their advocate, to list other possible institutional roles). As we \nnoted above when discussing CA's analysis of category terms and their implications \n(Sacks 1992), to specify a category is also to specify imply roles, hierarchies, obligations, \nand repertoires of behaviour. The identity of \u2018friend\u2019 might imply a range of things such \nas equality, mutual support, enjoyment of each others company, familiarity, ease of social \ninteraction, and absence of ulterior motives. When one acts for a friend, the moral order \nrequires we try to act in their best interests. Each of these associations answers a problem \nDeleted: is an issue is revealed in the \nidentity-categories in the content of what \nis said: in driving the residents towards \nexpressing the statement (whether they \nbelieve it or not) that staff members are \nfriends. To understand how this is \nstatement is replete with identity \nimplications, we combined CA's \nDeleted: categorical analysis with our \nknowledge of residential services and \nsocial constructions of people with \nlearning disabilities, on the one hand, and \nofficial discourse on the other.\n22 \nfor a residential institution, and each overcomes alternative constructions of the \nrelationship (and therefore identity) between staff member and resident. \n  \nWhy might it be desirable for a residential home to construct staff\/service-user \nrelationships in terms of friendships? Firstly such a construction implies happy people, a \nlack of conflict between staff and residents, and a harmonious social environment. This \nover-rides more difficult negotiations about relations between those paid by the state of a \nnon-governmental organisation and accountable to those bodies, and those they are there \nto support, and in particular the issue of power and control. If staff are constructed as \nacting on the basis of friendship, then their motivations, and loyalties, are not brought \ninto question. Secondly, it implies an equality in the humanity of the service-user and the \nstaff. This is just and right, and negates stigmatizing conclusions which are always latent \nin social constructions of people with learning disabilities, but the danger, as we have \nseen, is that it becomes \u2018lip service\u2019 if it obscures the ways in which identities are \nactually enacted. \n \nOverall, we might see, in this single case study, the operation of the dilemma between \ncare and control that is well-known to students of the caring professions, but given \nspecific discursive form. It is a standing danger for any institution that its official account \nof the people with whom it works may not be consistently respected in its officials' \nroutine day-today dealings with them. As we have seen here, even in ostensible \nempowering guidance on relationships may, under pressure to reach interactional goals of \nclosure, result in the attribution of people with learning disabilities with an unwarrantedly \nlimited social identity. \n \n23 \nReferences \n \nAmerican Association on Mental Retardation (1992).
