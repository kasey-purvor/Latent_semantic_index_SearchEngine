INTRODUCTION\nThe electromagnetic properties of an artificial material1\ncan, in principle, be selected by suitable design. These prop-\nerties of an artificial material, as with a naturally-occurring\nmaterial, are described in terms of: refractive indices \u0001n\u0002,\npermittivities \u0001\u0001\u0002, and, if appropriate, permeabilities \u0001\u0002\u0002.\nThese can be arranged to be high or low, zero or even nega-\ntive, and are likely to vary with frequency in the spectral\nregion of interest. In an artificial material, the electromag-\nnetic near field can be manipulated and exploited to realize\nnew types of lenses, waveguides, and imaging systems. Al-\nthough there is growing interest in this field in the\nmicrowave2 and optical3 parts of the spectrum, very little\nwork has been reported to date in the terahertz \u0001THz\u0002 range.\nThis is hardly surprising, as the importance of this region\n\u0001between radio and light\u0002 \u0001Ref. 4\u0002 is only now emerging as\nnew sources and functional components such as quantum\ncascade lasers5 and pulsed generation techniques6 are devel-\noped. In order to explore this region of the spectrum, devices\nsuch as THz microscopes are also being developed.7 Al-\nthough they are still in their infancy, THz microscopes have\nthe potential to enhance further our understanding of the fun-\ndamental properties of entities from living cells, to polymers\nand semiconductor devices. However, for this technology to\nrealize its potential, it is imperative that new types of lenses,\nprobes, and filters be developed for THz operation. Artificial\nmaterials, of the type discussed in this paper, will have a role\nto play in the realization of such instruments.\nIn this article, we describe the design, measurement, and\nanalysis of a type of artificial material for use at THz fre-\nquencies that is essentially a two-dimensional photonic crys-\ntal based on periodically spaced high aspect ratio metal pil-\nlars, which we term a pillar forest. It is known that such a\nsystem exhibits zero transmission of radiation with its elec-\ntric field parallel to the pillars for a range of frequency from\nzero up to some critical frequency. Specifically, Pendry\net al.8,9 have shown that the critical frequency of the artificial\nmaterial is the effective plasma frequency of the artificial\nmaterial; hence, the material\u2019s dielectric constant is negative\nfor lower frequencies. Pendry et al.8,9 have also shown that\nthe effective plasma frequency is dependent on the pillar\ndiameter and spacing and can be made much lower than that\nof the bulk metal used for the pillars. When the radiation\nfrequency is above the effective plasma frequency and its\nwavelength is comparable to the pillar spacing, the system\nexhibits photonic band structure effects, including transmis-\nsion and stop bands. In this article, we describe the fabrica-\ntion and study of pillar forest structures that have an effective\nplasma frequency in the THz regime and exhibit photonic\nband structure effects above the plasma frequency. In par-\nticular, we show that the structures can act as filters which\nhave useful properties at THz frequencies with a relative\ntransmission of up to 97% in the pass band.\nThe wavelength of the incident radiation determines the\ndimensional requirements of an artificial material. Microma-\nchining techniques are ideally suited for the development of\nTHz artificial materials \u0001where 1 THz\u0005300 \u0002m\u0002, but in the\ncase of the pillar forests, the need to have a pillar height in\nexcess of 1 mm to accommodate the radiation beam imposes\nspecial demands. The pillar forests were made using a novel\nultraviolet \u0001UV\u0002 exposure technique and fabrication process\nwith SU8, a negative epoxy-based photoresist.10 The trans-\nmission properties of these structures were measured at THz\nfrequencies in the range 0.2\u20133.0 THz and interpreted using a\ncomplex band structure method and finite difference time\ndomain \u0001FDTD\u0002 simulations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the fabrication\nmethod for realizing pillar forest and lattice fence structures\nis first outlined; the experimental arrangements for perform-\ning THz time domain spectroscopy are then described; the\ntransmission results for a series of pillar forest and lattice\nfence structures are then given; the procedures for botha\u0002Electronic mail: martyn.chamberlain@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 102, 023102 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/102\u00022\u0001\/023102\/5\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics102, 023102-1\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

The paper is concluded with a com-\nparison between theory and experiment.\nII. FABRICATION METHODS\nThe high aspect ratio \u000110:1 or greater\u0002 metal pillar arrays\nof the type used here, and illustrated in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002, are very\nchallenging to fabricate using conventional micromachining\ntechniques. Other groups have reported the use of\nmicrostereolithography11 and x-ray exposure.10 However, the\nmore commercially viable ultraviolet \u0001UV\u0002 micromachining\napproach has been overlooked until now. SU8 is a commer-\ncially available negative epoxy-based photoresist. When ex-\nposed to UV and thermally cured, it cross links and becomes\nboth chemically and mechanically resistant. Conventional\nSU8 processing requires a separate mask which is brought\ninto contact with the top of the soft baked resist during ex-\nposure. For very thick layers it is difficult to ensure that the\nSU8 at the bottom \u0001which is in contact with the substrate\u0002\nreceives a sufficiently high dose of UV radiation. If the dose\nis too low then only partial cross linking occurs and the\nstructures may delaminate during the wet development and\nrelease stages.\nFigure 1 shows a self-masking approach which effec-\ntively solves the delamination problem. The SU8\u201350 is soft\nbaked on a glass wafer which is coated with an optically\nopaque and patterned metal \u0001in this case, gold\u0002. The resist is\nthen drop dispensed and confined by an O ring during bak-\ning. After soft baking \u00015 h at 120 \u00b0C\u0002, the wafer can be\nflipped over and exposed with UV from the back. This is\nfollowed by post baking \u00011 h at 120 \u00b0C\u0002 and then the pillars\nare developed in EC-solvent \u0001for approximately 18 h\u0002. Criti-\ncally, this exposure technique ensures that the SU8 is well\ncross linked at the interface with the substrate. However,\nSU8 is transparent to THz and therefore, to complete the\ndevice, the pillars are sputter coated with gold \u0001\u00060.3 \u0002m\u0002 to\nproduce structures of the type shown in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. The exact\nthickness of the metal is not as important as that the process\nobtains a reasonably uniform coverage greater than the skin\ndepth. The short mean free path between molecules in the\nsputtering process \u0001no more than 3 mm at 10\u22122 Torr\u0002 ensures\na nondirectionality to the metal coating and so a uniform\ndeposition. The final structures are 1.3 mm tall. The process\nflow shown in Fig. 1 can produce a further type of high\naspect ratio device through the use of angled UV exposure.\nFigure 2 shows a lattice structure formed using a double\nexposure at two different angles relative to the incident UV\nbeam. Apart from the angled UV exposure, the fabrication\nprocess for lattice structures is identical to that for the high\naspect ratio pillars. This includes a gold sputter coating to\nblock the incident THz beam.\nIII. THZ MEASUREMENTS\nTHz time domain spectroscopy6 \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002 is used to\nmeasure the response of the artificial materials. A Ti:sapphire\nlaser produces a 600 mW, near infrared \u0001NIR\u0002 pulse of 20 fs\nduration with a repetition rate of 76 MHz. This is separated\ninto THz-generating and detector-gating beams with a 70:30\nbeam splitter. The NIR generating beam is focused onto a\nGaAs photoconductive strip-line emitter, grown by molecu-\nlar beam epitaxy, which is dc biased to 250 V. Parabolic\nmirrors are used to focus the THz signal onto the sample\n\u0001spot size \u00060.5 mm; and depth of field \u00061.5 mm\u0002. The gat-\ning and the THz beam are focused onto a 1 mm thick zinc\ntelluride electro-optic crystal. This, in conjunction with a bal-\nanced detector, is used to detect the THz radiation transmit-\nted through the structure. A delay line on the NIR generation\nbeam allows the electric field of the THz pulse to be scanned\nin the time domain. A fast fourier transform is then used to\nobtain a frequency spectrum. This system provides a usable\nbandwidth of approximately 3 THz. For relative transmission\nmeasurements, the sample scan is divided by a free space\nFIG. 1. SU8 pillar arrays, showing \u0001a\u0002 fabrication flow on silicon substrates,\nand \u0001b\u0002 final device realization.\nFIG. 2. A SU8 lattice fence structure fabricated by a variation on the process\nflow of Fig. 1.\n023102-2 Gallant et al. J. Appl. Phys. 102, 023102 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

This effectively deconvolves\nany reflected signals associated with the measurement setup.\nIV. TRANSMISSION OF METALLIZED PILLAR\nARRAYS\nIn order to vary the characteristics of these filter struc-\ntures, we fabricated devices with a range of pillar diameters\nbut a constant period of 200 \u0002m. This effectively changes\nthe fill factor; it would be expected that \u0001in addition to any\nfrequency shift in the pass\/stop bands\u0002 there would be a re-\nduction in the relative transmission as the metal\/air ratio in-\ncreases in the filters. We have also fabricated pillar arrays,\nwhere we have varied the period between pillars both normal\nand parallel to the direction of the THz beam. Figure 4 shows\nthe measured relative transmission for a six layer deep \u0001in the\ndirection of beam propagation\u0002 pillar array. The array is ar-\nranged in a square lattice, with the electric field component\nof the radiation orientated parallel to the pillar axes \u0001see Fig.\n3\u0002. The calculated transmission, with the pass band edges\nspecifically marked, are also shown in Fig. 4. The calcula-\ntions use FDTD simulations to generate the \u0001dotted\u0002 trans-\nmission curves. The edges of the complex band structure\nedges are also shown. Further discussion is given in Sec. V.\nIn each case the period is 200 \u0002m; the pillar diameters vary\nfrom 50 \u0002m to 80 \u0002m; and the height of the pillars is 1.3\nmm. The peak transmission for the pass bands is up to 97%\nwith the stop bands at around 2%. Good correlation between\ntheory and experiment is found. It is noted that the greatest\ntransmission occurs for the second photonic band; this is a\nconsequence of the plane wave radiation coupling less effi-\nciently into the first band. It is also noted from Fig. 4 that, as\nthe pillar diameter is increased, an increase in the center\nfrequency of the main and secondary pass bands is observed.\nFurthermore, there is a reduction in the relative transmission,\nas would be expected.\nThese results show that the spectral shift associated with\na relatively small \u000110 \u0002m\u0002 increase in the pillar diameter is\neasily resolvable with the THz spectrometer set-up used\nhere. This sensitivity to substantially highly subwavelength\nvariations in the pillar diameter has a range of potential ap-\nplications in sensing, in addition to that of THz filtering.\nFigure 5 shows the measured relative transmission character-\nistic from the six-layer deep lattice fence structure of Fig. 2.\nThe maximum relative transmission is comparable to that of\nthe 80 \u0002m diameter pillar array in Fig. 4. However, the sec-\nondary pass bands shown in the pillar array case are more\nsuppressed in the lattice device, leading to a single pass-band\ntype transmission. While the THz transmission properties of\nthe pillar array structures are amenable to theoretical analysis\n\u0001see the next section\u0002, models to explain the properties of the\n\u201cfence structures\u201d are still under development.\nV. THEORETICAL ANALYSES OF FILTER BEHAVIOR\nTwo approaches have been used to understand the be-\nhavior of the THz frequency filters: a complex photonic band\nstructure technique12 and FDTD simulations. However, be-\nfore describing that work, it is appropriate to introduce the\nconcept of an effective plasma frequency. Pendry et al.8,9\nstudied the electromagnetic properties of thin wire structures,\nFIG. 3. \u0001Upper\u0002 Experimental setup to investigate THz time domain spec-\ntroscopy showing the sample position. \u0001Lower\u0002 The propagation direction of\nthe THz beam relative to the vertical pillars.\nFIG. 4. Transmission of various pillar arrays. The pass bands, deduced from\ncomplex photonic band theory, are shown as dark horizontal lines. The \u201cfirst\nband,\u201d referred to in the text, corresponds to the leftmost line; the \u201csecond\u201d\nto the next band to the right; and so on. The dotted lines are FDTD\nsimulations.\n023102-3 Gallant et al. J. Appl. Phys. 102, 023102 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

In their thin wire\nmodel, which is notable for the fact that the result depends\nonly on geometrical factors and not the bulk plasma fre-\nquency of the metal of the wires, the effective plasma fre-\nquency is given by\n\u0003p,eff\n2\n=\n2\u0004c2\na2 ln\u0001a\/r\u0002\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere a is the lattice constant, r is the radius of the rods, and\nc the free-space velocity of light. In practice, no propagation\ncan occur in the infinite structure below the effective plasma\nfrequency, in analogy with the related effect in a homoge-\nneous material. Since the work of Pendry et al.8,9 a number\nof alternative simple analytic expressions for the effective\nplasma frequency have been proposed; further details are\nprovided by Brand et al.12 There have also been various\nother theoretical studies of both the photonic band structure\nfor infinite systems13,14 and the transmission properties in the\ncase of finite structures.15,16 Experimental results have been\nreported both in the original work of Pendry et al.8,9 and\nalso, more recently, by Pimenov and Loidl,17 who investi-\ngated arrays of copper and steel wires using broadband THz\nspectroscopy. In their case, the experimental structures con-\nsisted of three rows of metal wires in a square grid with\nlattice period of about 0.5 mm. As a consequence of the\nlarger lattice period, the frequency of interest in their study\nwas rather lower than in the present work, about 0.2 THz.\nFull details are given elsewhere12 of the frequency de-\npendent, plane wave based, complex band structure method\nthat has been used here. In essence, the array of rods, shown\nin Fig. 6 is considered to be embedded in a medium with\npermittivity \u0001b. The spatial dependence of the permittivity is\nthen represented in the form\n\u0001\u0001x,y\u0002 = \u0001\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002 = \u0001b + \u0003\u0001\u0001\u0003\u0002 \u2212 \u0001b\u0004S\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere S\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002=1 within the rods and S\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002=0 elsewhere. Using\na Fourier-series expansion of S\u0001\u0005\u0001 \u0002 and the electric field\nwithin the structure, Maxwell\u2019s equations are solved. Know-\ning the form of \u0001\u0001\u0003\u0002 it is possible to scan through frequency\nin order to determine the Bloch wave vector k, and thus the\nwhole complex band structure of the system can be mapped\nout. For our calculations we take the background permittivity\nto be that of air, \u0001b=1, and to represent the permittivity of\nthe gold rods, we employ the Drude expression\n\u0001\u0001\u0003\u0002 = 1 \u2212\n\u0003p\n2\n\u0003\u0001\u0003 + i\u0003c\u0002\n, \u00013\u0002\nwhere numerical values \u0003p=2\u0004\u00062.175\u00061015 s\u22121 \u0001for the\nbulk plasma frequency\u0002 and \u0003c=2\u0004\u00066.5\u00061012 s\u22121 \u0001for the\nabsorption term\u0002 are taken from Ordal et al.19 The band\nstructure calculations yield approximate values for the stop\nbands of the pillar array structures with a lattice constant of\n200 \u0002m, which are shown in Fig. 6 and in more detail in\nFig. 7. In calculating these results the absorption term has\nbeen neglected without significant loss of accuracy. To obtain\nthe results displayed in the figure, 877 plane waves were\nused for the electric field expansion.

CONCLUSION\nWe have designed, fabricated, and tested an artificial\nTHz plasmonic material structure, a pillar forest, which may\nhave applications as a system component at THz frequencies.\nWe have demonstrated a readily available, UV based ap-\nproach to the fabrication of this material. The process has\nbeen modified to include angled SU8 exposure which pro-\nduces high aspect ratio lattice fence type structures. The pil-\nlar arrays fabricated using this technique showed a clear\nband structure in their THz transmission. The peak transmis-\nsion of 97% makes this type of structure ideal for filtering or\nsensing applications. The effect of increasing the diameter of\nthe pillars on the band structure is experimentally demon-\nstrated and an increase in the center frequency of the main\nand secondary pass bands is observed. We have applied both\nan FDTD simulation and a photonic band gap analysis to\nmodel the transmission properties of these structures. The\nphotonic band gap analysis provides an excellent description\nof the observed pass bands.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of the En-\ngineering and Physical Science Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom for funding \u0001EP\/C534263\/1\u0002.
