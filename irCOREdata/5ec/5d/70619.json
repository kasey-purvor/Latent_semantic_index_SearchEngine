The scheme yields an asymptotic approximation in terms of inhomogeneous linear\nequations for the self-consistent Maxwell field, charge current and time-like velocity field of the\ncharged fluid and is defined as an ultra-relativistic configuration.

A common theme in these developments is the interaction between charged particles and\nthe electromagnetic field in domains where relativistic effects cannot be ignored.\nIt is remarkable that many of the challenges that must be addressed in order to develop and control\ndevices that accelerate charged particles have their origin in the interaction of particles with their own\nelectromagnetic field. Despite the fact that the classical laws of electromagnetism were essentially\nformulated over a century and a half ago the subject of electromagnetic interactions with matter\nremains incomplete. This incompleteness has had concomitant effects on the development of quantum\nelectrodynamics and renormalisation theory. At root, the difficulties reside in the recognition that\n1\nthe quantum structure of matter at some scale is beyond observation. Furthermore, the classical\ndescription of the electron as a point particle leads to singularities in the Maxwell self-fields that\ninevitably create ambiguities in its interaction with the Maxwell field. The general consensus is\nthat a useful domain of validity of the Lorentz-Dirac equation [1, 2, 3], describing covariantly the\nradiation reaction on a point electron, can be accommodated by performing a\u201creduction of order\u201d\nthat effectively replaces the equation by a perturbative second order system for the particle world\nline. One must then decide whether higher order terms in this expansion should be maintained given\nthe neglect of terms associated with the regularisation scheme. This approach is behind many of the\nsuccessful applications of approximate radiation reaction dynamics, despite the somewhat delicate\nand unsatisfactory nature of the arguments that purport to support this approach.\nIt appears that the analysis of systems involving radiating matter has progressed by a very\nsuccessful symbiosis between experimental expediency and a variety of approximation schemes with\nproven effectiveness in different domains of validity. However, as schemes for accelerating charged\nparticles in these devices become more complex and ambitious in their aims it is apparent that some\nexisting theoretical models are inadequate for a proper understanding of new challenges. Such models\nare sometimes enshrined in large commercial computer codes that do not survive scientific scrutiny\nor have documentation that makes contact with established scientific literature difficult. As particle\nenergies increase with the use of higher intensity laser fields this issue becomes critical and more\nreliable methods for accommodating radiation reaction must be found.\nA mathematically coherent formulation of a closed system of partial differential equations describ-\ning the relativistic behaviour of charged matter with electromagnetic fields is inevitably non-linear\nand, in general, exact solutions satisfying causal boundary conditions are intractable. The fact that\nthe effects of (coherent and incoherent) radiation on micrometre-sized charged bunches in a host\nof newly proposed advanced devices is a significant barrier to development indicates that existing\napproaches used to model such effects are inadequate and that a new look at the whole problem is\ntimely.\nMany of the radiation problems alluded to above can be circumvented by working entirely in\nthe language of fields rather than both particles and fields. This makes it possible to use intrin-\nsic tensor field theory and exploit to the full the power of differential geometry in a relativistic\nspacetime framework. The geometric field formulation offers a number of powerful computational\nadvantages over existing formulations of beam dynamics. These include the maintenance of relativis-\ntic covariance (local Lorentz transformation between local (accelerating) frames are unnecessary),\nthe use of curvilinear coordinates adapted to the geometry of particular problems (thereby facilitat-\ning imposition of boundary conditions), exploitation of available symmetries and the formulation of\ncoordinate-independent approximation schemes.\nIn this article a new approach is offered for analysing the behaviour of distributions of charged\nparticles in a coupled electromagnetic field environment. Guided by a simple model, an approxima-\ntion scheme designed for charged distributions containing ultra-relativistic particles1 is explored. The\nexact equations of motion are derived from the vanishing divergence of a relativistic stress-energy\ntensor for matter and radiation. Before presenting the approximation scheme in detail we recall the\ngenesis of the radiation reaction for a point charge, mention its shortcomings and argue that these\nmay be overcome by treating a large collection of charged particles as a continuum.\n1A novel definition of an \u201cultra-relativistic vector field\u201d relying entirely on the light-cone structure of spacetime is\ngiven in Appendix A.1.\n2\n1.1 Equations of motion for radiating charges\nIn this paper the language of differential geometry is employed since it offers the most succinct\nmathematical framework for electrodynamics. Thus, all fields will be regarded as sections of tensor\nbundles over appropriate domains M of Minkowski spacetime endowed with a fixed metric g and a\ntorsion-free metric compatible connection \u2207. Sections of the tangent bundle overM will be denoted\n\u0393TM while sections of the bundle of exterior p-forms will be denoted \u0393\u039bpM. For any vector field\nX denote by X\u02dc the associated 1-form defined by X\u02dc = g(X,\u2212). The operator d will denote the\nexterior derivative and iX the contraction operator with respect to X. To facilitate comparisons\nwith existing accounts of beam dynamics Appendix A.2 translates the tensor formulation of the\nperturbation scheme into the 3-vector language involving electric and magnetic fields observed in a\nlaboratory (inertial) frame.\nDue to its high symmetry, Minkowski spacetime admits a class of global charts that play a\nfundamental role in the following. A generic system of coordinates in one of these charts will be\ndenoted {y\u00b5} \u2208 R4 where \u00b5 ranges from 0 to 3. In these coordinates the metric tensor takes the form\ng = \u2212d y0 \u2297 d y0 + d y1 \u2297 d y1 + d y2 \u2297 d y2 + d y3 \u2297 d y3. (1)\nWith y0 > 0 the field \u2202\n\u2202y0\nis defined to be future-pointing. When convenient y0 = ct, y1 = x, y2 =\ny, y3 = z is written and the vacuum speed of light c is set to 1. The significance of this class of\ncoordinates is that it offers a basis of symmetry generators {K\u00b5 = \u2202\u2202y\u00b5}:\nLK\u00b5g = 0 (2)\nwhere LX is the Lie derivative with respect to X. Such Killing vectors will be used to define energy-\nmomentum densities and power-momentum fluxes associated with different field configurations on\nspacetime.\nIf U is a domain of spacetime with boundary\n\u2202U = \u03a31 + \u03a32 +\u03a0 (3)\nfor space-like hypersurfaces \u03a31,\u03a32 and J a closed regular 3-form on U (i.e. dJ = 0) then\u222b\n\u2202U\nJ =\n\u222b\nU\ndJ = 0. (4)\nThus \u222b\n\u03a31\nJ =\n\u222b\n\u2212\u03a32\nJ \u2212\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nJ . (5)\nSuch closed 3-forms imply conservation laws.\nIn a vacuum the electric and magnetic fields are encoded into the 2-form F and the electric\ncharge density and current are described by a source current 3-form j. The Maxwell field system on\nspacetime is\ndF = 0 (6)\nand\nd ? G = \u2212j (7)\nwhere ? is the Hodge map associated with the spacetime metric tensor g and G = \u00b20F where \u00b20 is\nthe permittivity of the vacuum.\n3\nFor any vector field W on spacetime and any Maxwell solution F define the \u201celectromagnetic\ndrive\u201d 3-form\n\u03c4\n(EM)\nW =\n1\n2\n{iWF \u2227 ?F \u2212 iW ? F \u2227 F}. (8)\nIf W is a Killing vector field then \u03c4\n(EM)\nW is called a \u201cKilling current\u201d and\nd \u03c4\n(EM)\nW =\n1\n\u00b20\niWF \u2227 j (9)\nfollows from (6), (7) and (8). For each Killing vector field these equations establish a \u201clocal conser-\nvation equation\u201d( d\u03c4W = 0) in a source free region (j = 0).\nIf U is any time-like vector field (with g(U,U) = \u2212c2) one may write uniquely\nF = e\u02dc \u2227 U\u02dc + ?(b\u02dc \u2227 U\u02dc) (10)\nwhere g(e, U) = g(b, U) = 0 and\n1\nc2\n\u03c4\n(EM)\nU = \u2212e\u02dc \u2227 b\u02dc \u2227 U\u02dc \u2212\n1\n2\n{g(e, e) + g(b, b)}iU(?1). (11)\nPoynting2 related the form e\u02dc \u2227 b\u02dc, in a source free region, to the local field energy transmitted\nnormally across unit area per second (spatial field energy current or field power) and 1\n2\n{g(e, e)+g(b, b)}\nto the local electromagnetic field energy density.\nMore precisely 1\nc\n\u222b\n\u03a3\n\u03c4\n(EM)\nU is the field energy associated with the space-like 3-chain \u03a3 and\n1\nc2\n\u222b\nS\niU\u03c4\n(EM)\nU\nis the power flux across an oriented space-like 2-chain S.\nIf X is a space-like Killing vector generating space-like translations along open integral curves\nthen with the split:\n\u03c4\n(EM)\nX = \u00b5X \u2227 U\u02dc + GX , (12)\nwhere iU\u00b5X = 0 and iUGX = 0, the Maxwell stress 2-form \u00b5X may be used to identify mechanical\nforces produced by a flow of field momentum with density 3-form GX . In any local frame {Xa \u2208\n\u0393TM} with dual coframe {eb \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M} the 16 functions T (EM)ab = iXb ? \u03c4 (EM)Xa , where the frame\nindices a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3, may be used to construct the second-rank stress-energy tensor\nT (EM) = T\n(EM)\nab e\na \u2297 eb.\nA standard application of these general notions is the derivation of the equation of motion of\na charged fluid in an external electromagnetic field from the total stress-energy of the fluid and\nelectromagnetic field. A thermodynamically inert (cold) fluid can be modelled with the stress-energy\ntensor\nT (f) =\nm0\nc\u00b20\nN V\u02dc \u2297 V\u02dc (13)\nwhere N is a scalar number density field, m0 some constant with the dimensions of mass, V the unit\ntime-like 4-velocity field of the fluid and g(V, V ) = \u22121. Such a stress-energy tensor gives rise to a\nset of Killing currents\n\u03c4\n(f)\nK\u00b5\n=\nm0\nc\u00b20\ng(V,K\u00b5) ? (N V\u02dc ) (14)\n2In a pre-relativistic context.\n4\nwhich are added to \u03c4\n(EM)\nK\u00b5\nto yield the total set of Killing currents for the interacting system. If one\nassumes that the electric current 3-form is j = q0N ? V\u02dc for some electric charge constant q0 and that\nN is regular then the conservation laws\nd j = 0 (15)\nd(\u03c4\n(EM)\nK\u00b5\n+ \u03c4\n(f)\nK\u00b5\n) = 0 (16)\nyield the field equation of motion\n\u2207V V\u02dc = q0\nm0c2\niVF . (17)\nThis equation must be solved consistently with the Maxwell equations (6), (7) to determine V , N\nand F for prescribed initial and boundary conditions.\nIf the source of F contains a point charge in an external field this approach must take into account\nthat part of the electromagnetic field becomes singular on the world-line of the particle so the domain\nU above must exclude this line. Furthermore, one needs to postulate a stress-energy tensor for a stable\npoint particle. Without further information application of Stokes\u2019 theorem then leaves an unknown\ncontribution to the conservation law. However, experiment indicates that accelerating electrons\n(thought to be point particles) experience a reaction to their emitted radiation and that the power\nradiated is in good agreement with the covariant Larmor formula [4]. A number of methods have been\ndevised in an attempt to accommodate this observed radiation reaction by adopting a regularisation\nprocedure that permits the use of Stokes\u2019 theorem in a spacetime region that includes the particle\nworld-line. Inevitably this requires some assumption of how the singular Coulombic stresses are\ncompensated by stresses that are not of electromagnetic origin. Early approaches invoked delicate\nlimiting processes and the use of both advanced as well as retarded solutions to Maxwell\u2019s equations\n[5, 3]. Dirac [5] offered one of the simplest covariant regularisation schemes and the resulting equation\nof motion is known as the Lorentz-Dirac equation. The use of both advanced and retarded solutions\nis however unnecessary [6, 7].\nTo highlight the assumptions in the single particle approach to radiation reaction an outline is\ngiven of how the Lorentz-Dirac equation can be derived using a coordinate system adapted to the\nlight-cone structure of spacetime and the time-like world-line of a particle on a parametrised history\ngiven in the above chart as y\u00b5 = \u03be\u00b5(u). For each value of u the unit tangent to the world-line is the\n4-velocity\nV = V \u00b5(u)\n\u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\n(18)\nwhere V \u00b5(u) = d\u03be\n\u00b5(u)\ndu\n.\nAssign to any event in spacetime not on the particle world-line, whose backward light-cone\nintersects this world-line at the event with parameter u, the set of coordinates {u, r, \u03b8, \u03c6} with\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e, 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 pi, 0 < \u03c6 \u2264 2pi using the transformation\ny\u00b5 = \u03be\u00b5(u) +\nr\nP(u, \u03b8, \u03c6)L\n\u00b5(\u03b8, \u03c6), (19)\nwhere for any y0 > 0 :\nL =\n\u2202\n\u2202y0\n+\n3\u2211\nk=1\nnk(\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\u2202\n\u2202yk\n= L\u00b5\n\u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\n(20)\n3\u2211\nk=1\n(nk(\u03b8, \u03c6))2 = 1 (21)\n5\nP = \u2212g(V, L), g(V, V ) = \u22121, g(L,L) = 0. (22)\nIn these coordinates the particle world-line is the curve where3 r = 0, (\u03b8, \u03c6) parametrise the unit\n2-sphere S2 where {nk(\u03b8, \u03c6)} are direction cosines and the metric tensor can be written:\ng = \u2212e0 \u2297 e0 + e1 \u2297 e1 + e2 \u2297 e2 + e3 \u2297 e3 (23)\nwhere\ne0 = B d u\u2212 1B d r (24)\ne1 =\nd r\nB (25)\ne2 =\nr\nP d \u03b8 (26)\ne3 =\nr\nP sin \u03b8 d \u03c6 (27)\nB =\n\u221a\n1 + 2r\nP\u02d9\nP . (28)\nHere, and in the following, denote \u2202uf by f\u02d9 for any scalar field f and let T\u02d9 = L \u2202\n\u2202u\nT for any tensor\nfield T .\nSuppose the total system (electromagnetic field and charge) has a stress-energy tensor giving rise\nto a regular Killing current \u03c4K such that\nd \u03c4K = 0 (29)\nin a domain U bounded by the light-like 3-chains \u03a3(u = u0 + \u2206u), \u03a3(u = u0) and the time-like\n3-chain \u03a3(r = r0) for arbitrary positive constants u0,\u2206u, r0. Then\u222b\n\u03a3(u=u0+\u2206u)\n\u03c4K \u2212\n\u222b\n\u03a3(u=u0)\n\u03c4K +\n\u222b\n\u03a3(r=r0)\n\u03c4K = 0. (30)\nIn the limit \u2206u\u2192 0 this may be written\nP\u02d9\n(B)\nK (u0, r0) d u+ P\u02d9\n(C)\nK (u0, r0) d u = 0 (31)\nwhere\nP\u02d9\n(B)\nK (u0, r0) =\n\u222b r0\n0\n\u222b\nS2\n\u03c4\u02d9K(u0, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) (32)\nP\u02d9\n(C)\nK (u0, r0) =\n\u222b\nS2\ni\u2202u\u03c4K(u0, r0, \u03b8, \u03c6) (33)\nWith K \u2208 { \u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\n} and \u2207 \u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\n= 0 one has a similar balance of rates for each translational Killing\nvector in the basis. In terms of the \u201cbody\u201d rate\nP\u02d9 (B) \u2261 P\u02d9 (B)\u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\nd y\u00b5 (34)\nand the \u201ccontact\u201d rate\nP\u02d9 (C) \u2261 P\u02d9 (C)\u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\nd y\u00b5 (35)\n3For P > 0 with V time-like and \u2202\u2202y0 future-pointing the set r \u2265 0 lies on the forward light-cone of the event \u03be\u00b5(u).\n6\nthere is a balance of 1 forms:\nP\u02d9 (B)(u0, r0) + P\u02d9\n(C)(u0, r0) = 0. (36)\nNext assume that the contact rate includes a part from the Killing currents \u03c4\n(EM)\nK , i.e.\nP\u02d9 (C) = P\u02d9\n(C)\nMECH + P\u02d9\n(C)\nEM (37)\nand furthermore that this part can be calculated from the retarded Lie\u00b4nard-Wiechert solution F to\nMaxwell\u2019s equations for an arbitrarily moving point charge q0 in no external electromagnetic field.\nIn these coordinates the solution is F = dA where the 1-form\nA =\nq0\n4pi\u00b20\nV\u02dc (u)\nr\n. (38)\nIntegration over the 2-chain S2 with r = r0 yields for (33) :\nP\u02d9\n(C)\nEM =\nq20\n4pi\u00b220\n{\n2\n3\nA\u02dc(A) V\u02dc + A\u02dc\n2r0\n} \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nu=u0\n(39)\nwhere A = V\u02d9 \u00b5(u) \u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\nis the acceleration field. Clearly this 1-form is singular on the world-line where\nr0 = 0. The first term however correctly accounts for the observed Larmor radiation rate of energy-\nmomentum from an accelerating charge and is independent of r0. To proceed one must cancel the\nsingular rate in P\u02d9\n(C)\nEM from singular terms in the remaining rates in such a way that in the limit r0 \u2192 0\nthe resulting system of ordinary differential equations for arbitrary u0 makes both mathematical and\nphysical sense. One approach is to suppose that the remaining rates are determined in terms of\nscalar fields \u03b1(u, r), \u03b2(u, r) and the vectors V,A such that\nP (B)(u, r0) + P\n(C)\nMECH(u, r0) = \u03b1(u, r0)V\u02dc (u, r0) + \u03b2(u, r0)A\u02dc(u, r0). (40)\nInserting this in (36) and applying the projection operator \u03a0V = 1 + V\u02dc \u2227 iV one finds\n\u03b2 = \u22122\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b220\n+\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\u02dc(A) (41)\nWith this value (36) yields\nA\u02dc\n[\n\u03b1\u2212 d\ndu\n(\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\u02dc(A)\n)\n+\nq20\n4pi\u00b220\n1\n2r0\n]\n= \u2212V\u02dc\n[\n\u03b1\u02d9 +\n2\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b220\nA\u02dc(A)\n]\n+\n[\n2\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b220\n+\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\u02dc(A)\n] \u02dc\u02d9A (42)\nwhere A\u02d9 = V\u00a8 \u00b5(u) \u2202\n\u2202y\u00b5\n. One way to simplify this and cancel the exposed electromagnetic singularity\nis to further assume that \u03b1(u, r0) =\nm0c2\n\u00b20\n\u2212 q20\n4pi\u00b220\n1\n2r0\nfor some constant m0 so that in the limit r0 \u2192 0\none has:\nm0c\n2A\u02dc = 2\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b20\n\u03a0V\n\u02dc\u02d9A (43)\nor\nm0c\n2A\u02dc = \u22122\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b20\niV (V\u02dc \u2227 \u02dc\u02d9A). (44)\n7\nThis is a manifestly covariant equation of motion even though the velocity and acceleration are\nspecified in a basis of Killing vector fields. Since it is tensorial it is independent of basis and in terms\nof covariant differentiation along the world-line it may be written\nm0c\n2A\u02dc = \u22122\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b20\niV (V\u02dc \u2227\u2207V A\u02dc). (45)\nThis is a system of third order differential equations for the worldline \u03be\u00b5(u). Regarded as an initial\nvalue problem it requires unfamiliar initial data (\u03be\u00b5(0), \u03be\u02d9\u00b5(0), \u03be\u00a8\u00b5(0)) and solutions exist corresponding\nto self acceleration which must be regarded as unphysical.\nIn the presence of an external Maxwell field Fext one must confine the motion of the particle to a\ndomain U that excludes the sources of Fext. In this situation one expects that the equation of motion\nwill acquire a contribution from the Lorentz force q0iVFext:\nm0c\n2A\u02dc = q0iVFext + 2\n3\nq20\n4pi\u00b20\n\u03a0V\n\u02dc\u02d9A (46)\nso that m0 is identified with the rest mass of the point particle.\nAlthough solutions to this system that self-accelerate can be eliminated by demanding contrived\ndata at different points along the world-line there remain solutions that pre-accelerate in situa-\ntions where the external field is piecewise defined in spacetime [3]. Although the duration of pre-\nacceleration is probably classically unobservable for most electrons this general feature suggests that\nnot all of the assumptions above are acceptable.\nOne resolution of these difficulties [1] is to assume that the right hand side of (46) should be\nexpanded as a series in q0 with leading term for A\u02dc given by q0mc2 iVFext. Then the above assumptions\nare held to be accurate only to some order in q0 and (46) is understood as:\nA\u02dc = q0\nm0c2\niVFext \u2212 2\n3m0c2\nq20\n4pi\u00b20\niV (V\u02dc \u2227\u2207V A\u02dcext) + . . . (47)\nwhere A\u02dcext = q0m0c2 iVFext. The system is now manifestly a second order system of evolution equations.\nAlthough this offers a workable scheme it is unclear what its limitations are in different types of\nexternal field. Furthermore in situations where one has to contemplate the radiation from a large\nnumber of accelerating high-energy particles in close proximity the neglect of higher order terms in\nthe expansion may be suspect.\nGiven the complexities and reservations associated with (47) compared with the model leading\nto (17) the latter is adopted in this article as a description of a collection of potentially radiating\nparticles in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Thus, our fundamental set of equations\nis\ndF = 0 , (48)\nd ? F = \u2212q0\n\u00b20\nN ? V\u02dc , (49)\n\u2207V V\u02dc = q0\nm0c2\niVF , (50)\nV \u00b7 V = \u22121 (51)\nwhere X \u00b7 Y \u2261 g(X, Y ) for all vector fields X, Y \u2208 \u0393TM.\n8\nTo simplify the subsequent analysis the system (48-51) is recast using the 2-form F = q0\nm0c2\nF and\nthe scalar field \u03c1 =\nq20\n\u00b20m0c2\nN where q0N is the proper charge density since N is the proper number\ndensity. This yields the system of field equations\ndF = 0 , (52)\nd ? F = \u2212\u03c1 ? V\u02dc , (53)\n\u2207V V\u02dc = iV F , (54)\nV \u00b7 V = \u22121 (55)\nfor the triple (V, \u03c1, F ). Equation (53) leads immediately to the integrability condition (conservation\nof electric charge)\nd ? (\u03c1V\u02dc ) = 0. (56)\nThe scalar field \u03c1 will be referred to as the reduced proper charge density. Since N is a number\ndensity, N \u2265 0 and so \u03c1 \u2265 0 for q0 > 0 and q0 < 0.\n2 Symmetric solutions to the coupled field system\nAlthough the field system (52-55) appears considerably less complicated than a large number of\nordinary differential equations for a collection of accelerating charges, it is non-linear in (V, \u03c1, F )\nand so obtaining exact solutions is difficult except in certain simple circumstances. One method of\nobtaining solutions in more general situations is to employ a perturbation scheme based on properties\nof a particular class of exact solutions.\nIn this section a family of exact dynamical solutions with symmetries generated by \u2202\n\u2202y1\nand \u2202\n\u2202y2\nwill\nbe described. Such highly symmetric solutions can be interpreted as accelerating \u201cwalls of charge\u201d\nmoving in vacuo under the influence of their self-fields (their \u201cspace-charge\u201d fields) and an externally\napplied field. The coordinate y0 will be identified with time t in an inertial laboratory frame (the\nspeed of light c = 1) and x \u2261 y1, y \u2261 y2, and z \u2261 y3. The solutions will be independent of y1 and y2\ni.e.\nL \u2202\n\u2202y1\nF = L \u2202\n\u2202y2\nF = 0,\nL \u2202\n\u2202y1\nV = L \u2202\n\u2202y2\nV = 0.\nThus one may reduce the problem to a field theory on a 2-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime with\nglobal coordinates y0, y3. The field system (52-55) is solved exactly using a co-moving coordinate\nsystem (\u03c4, \u03c3) adapted to the charged continuum. However, expressing the solutions in terms of\nlaboratory coordinates (t, z) requires the inverse of the mapping (\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2192 (t, z), which is generally\ndifficult to obtain in closed form. To progress, a running parameter \u03b5 > 0 is introduced into the\nmapping (\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2192 (t, z) and a perturbation scheme in \u03b5 is established. This approach facilitates\nan order-by-order construction of the inverse of the mapping (\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2192 (t, z) and thereby leads to\n1-parameter families (V \u03b5, \u03c1\u03b5, F \u03b5) of solutions in \u03b5. It will be shown that\nF \u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nFn, V\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nVn, \u03c1\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b5n\u03c1n\n9\nover some range of \u03b5 where the coefficients Fn, Vn and \u03c1n are 2-forms, vector fields and scalar fields\nrespectively.\nExact solutions to the system of equations (52-55) are obtained using the ansa\u00a8tz\nF = E(t, z) dt \u2227 dz,\nV =\n1\u221a\n1\u2212 \u00b52(t, z) (\u2202t + \u00b5(t, z)\u2202z)\nwhere \u00b5 is the magnitude of the Newtonian velocity field of the charged continuum measured by the\ninertial (laboratory) observer \u2202t. Equations (52) and (55) are manifestly satisfied while (53) and (54)\nlead to\ndE = \u03c1#V\u02dc , (57)\n\u2207V V\u02dc = E#V\u02dc (58)\nwhere # is the Hodge map associated with the volume 2-form #1 \u2261 dt\u2227dz. Since iV#\u03b1 = #(\u03b1\u2227 V\u02dc )\nfor all forms \u03b1 independent of dx and dy, the action of iV on (57) yields\nV E = 0 (59)\ni.e. E is constant along the integral curves of V . Let C\u03c3 be a 1-parameter family of proper-time-\nparametrised integral curves of V where each value of \u03c3 corresponds to an integral curve of V :\nC\u03c3 : R\u2192M,\n\u03c4 \u2192 (t = t\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3), z = z\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3))\nand\nV = C\u03c3\u2217\u2202\u03c4 =\n\u2202t\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202t +\n\u2202z\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202z\nwhere C\u03c3\u2217 is the push-forward (tangent) map associated with C\u03c3. Equation (59) is\n(C\u03c3\u2217\u2202\u03c4 )E = \u2202\u03c4 (C\u2217\u03c3E)\n= 0\nwhere C\u2217\u03c3 is the pull-back map associated with C\u03c3. Hence C\n\u2217\n\u03c3E depends only on \u03c3 and can be\nexpressed using the function \u03b6 : R\u2192 R where\n\u03b6(\u03c3) \u2261 C\u2217\u03c3E\n= E (t\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3), z\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3)) . (60)\nUsing \u2207\u2202t = \u2207\u2202z = 0 the (t, z) components of (58) are\n\u22022t\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n(\u03c4, \u03c3) = \u03b6(\u03c3)z\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3),\n\u22022z\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n(\u03c4, \u03c3) = \u03b6(\u03c3)t\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) (61)\n10\nwhose particular solution satisfying the initial conditions\nt\u02c6(0, \u03c3) = 0, z\u02c6(0, \u03c3) = \u03c3,\n\u2202t\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n(0, \u03c3) = 1,\n\u2202z\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n(0, \u03c3) = 0,\nat \u03c4 = 0 is\nt = t\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) =\n1\n\u03b6(\u03c3)\nsinh(\u03b6(\u03c3)\u03c4) , (62)\nz = z\u02c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) =\n1\n\u03b6(\u03c3)\n[cosh(\u03b6(\u03c3)\u03c4)\u2212 1] + \u03c3 (63)\nwhere the function \u03b6 : R \u2192 R must be supplied as data (i.e. \u03b6 is an ingredient in the initial\nconditions). Note that the charged continuum is taken to be initially at rest in the laboratory, i.e.\nV\n\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4=0\n= (C\u03c3\u2217\u2202\u03c4 )\n\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4=0\n= \u2202t.\nMore general initial conditions could have been used, but the above scenario is sufficient.\nAfter \u03b6 has been specified, expressions for V and F in the (t, z) coordinate system are obtained\nby inverting (62) and (63) to give (\u03c4, \u03c3) in terms of (t, z):\n\u03c4 = \u03c4\u02c6(t, z),\n\u03c3 = \u03c3\u02c6(t, z)\nand using (60) it follows that\nE(t, z) = \u03b6 (\u03c3\u02c6(t, z)) .\nAn initial condition on E is expressed using \u03b6. Equation (62) is used to show that the local\nhypersurfaces t = 0 and \u03c4 = 0 are equal and so (63) yields\n\u03c3\u02c6(0, z) = z.\nThus, (60) leads to\nE(0, z) = \u03b6 (\u03c3\u02c6(0, z))\n= \u03b6(z)\non the space-like hypersurface t = 0.\nNot all choices for \u03b6 are admissible because, as noted in the derivation of (52-55), the reduced\nproper charge density \u03c1 is positive:\n\u03c1 = \u2212iV (#dE) \u2265 0 (64)\nusing (57) and (55). At t = \u03c4 = 0\n\u03c1(0, z) = \u2212i\u2202t#(\u2202tE(0, z)dt+ \u2202zE(0, z)dz)\n= \u2202zE(0, z)\n= \u03b6 \u2032(z)\n(65)\nwhere #dt = \u2212dz and #dz = \u2212dt have been used and \u03b6 \u2032(z) \u2261 d\u03b6\ndz\n(z). Hence, employing (64)\n\u03b6 \u2032(z) \u2265 0\n11\ni.e. \u03b6 is a monotonically increasing function.\nThe coordinate chart (\u03c4, \u03c3) has important physical significance because it labels the streamlines\nof the charged continuum (the integral curves of V ). Physically, the coordinate transformation\n(\u03c4, \u03c3)\u2192 (t, z) is expected to be valid over the entire (\u03c4, \u03c3) plane. This will now be shown.\nThe determinant \u2206 of the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation (\u03c4, \u03c3)\u2192 (t, z) is\n\u2206 \u2261 det\n[\n\u2202t\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202z\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202t\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202z\u02c6\n\u2202\u03c3\n]\n= \u2212 \u03b6\n\u2032(\u03c3)\n\u03b6(\u03c3)2\n+ cosh(\u03b6(\u03c3)\u03c4)\n(\n1 +\n\u03b6 \u2032(\u03c3)\n\u03b6(\u03c3)2\n)\n.\n(66)\nSince \u03b6 \u2032(\u03c3) \u2265 0 and cosh(\u03b6(\u03c3)\u03c4) \u2265 1 it follows that\n\u2206 \u2265 1.\nMonotonicity of \u03b6 implies that \u03b6 must vanish somewhere. Let \u03c30 \u2208 R be the point where \u03b6(\u03c30) = 0\nand note\nlim\n\u03c3\u2192\u03c30\n\u2206 = 1 +\n1\n2\n\u03b6 \u2032(\u03c30)\u03c4 2\nusing (66). Therefore, \u2206 is finite for all (\u03c4, \u03c3) \u2208 R2 and the coordinate transformation (\u03c4, \u03c3)\u2192 (t, z)\nis valid over the entire (\u03c4, \u03c3) plane.\nThe implicit equation\n\u03c3 = z \u2212 1\n\u03b6(\u03c3)\n(\u221a\n1 + [\u03b6(\u03c3)]2 t2 \u2212 1\n)\n(67)\nfor \u03c3 = \u03c3\u02c6(t, z) arises by combining (62) with (63).\nThe initial electric field E(0, z) = \u03b6(z) = \u03b6ext + \u03b6self(z) where \u03b6ext models an externally applied\nfield and \u03b6self is the self-field of the charged continuum. The field \u03b6ext is constant because it satisfies\nthe vacuum Maxwell equation\nd\u03b6ext = 0\ninside the charged continuum (consider equation (57) with \u03c1 = 0). The self-field \u03b6self is to be defined\nin terms of the initial reduced proper charge density \u03c1(0, z):\n\u03b6self(z) \u2261 1\n2\n[\u222b z\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c1(0, s) ds\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\nz\n\u03c1(0, s) ds\n]\n(68)\nand satisfies the asymptotic conditions\nlim\nz\u2192\u221e\n\u03b6self(z) =\n1\n2\nQ,\nlim\nz\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\u03b6self(z) = \u22121\n2\nQ\nwhere Q =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e \u03c1(0, z)dz is the total charge per unit area of the continuum.\nIllustrations of the above results are shown in figures 1-4. In figures 1 and 2 the external field is\nset to zero so the charge distribution \u03c1 evolves entirely under its own self-field. In figures 3 and 4\nthe external field is set to a finite value. Figures 2 and 4 show the streamlines of V in spacetime for\neach case.

One way of tackling this problem is to introduce a running parameter\n\u03b5 > 0, replace \u03c3\u02c6 by a 1-parameter family of functions \u03c3\u02c6\u03b5 and solve (67) for \u03c3\u02c6\u03b5 order-by-order in \u03b5.\nTo effect the coordinate transformation from (\u03c4, \u03c3) to (t, z) \u03b6 is replaced with the 1-parameter\nfamily of functions \u03b6\u03b5:\n\u03b6\u03b5(\u03c3) =\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03b6\u22121 + \u03b60(\u03c3).

(71)\nThe electric field component E\u03b5(t, z) and 4-velocity field V \u03b5 can be written entirely in terms of\n\u03c3\u02c6\u03b5, t and z:\nE\u03b5(t, z) = \u03b6\u03b5 (\u03c3\u02c6\u03b5(t, z))\nV \u03b5 =\n\u221a\n1 + [\u03b6\u03b5 (\u03c3\u02c6\u03b5(t, z))]2t2\u2202t + \u03b6\n\u03b5 (\u03c3\u02c6\u03b5(t, z))t\u2202z.\nUsing (70), (67), (71), the choice4 \u03b6\u22121 > 0 and t > 0, by equating orders in \u03b5 it follows that\n\u03c3\u02c6\u03b5(t, z) = z \u2212 t+ \u03b5\n\u03b6\u22121\n\u2212 1 + 2t\u03b60(z \u2212 t)\n2t\u03b62\u22121\n\u03b52 +O(\u03b53), (72)\nE\u03b5(t, z) = 1\n\u03b5\n\u03b6\u22121 + \u03b60(z \u2212 t) + \u03b6\n\u2032\n0(z \u2212 t)\n\u03b6\u22121\n\u03b5+O(\u03b52), (73)\nV \u03b5 =\n[\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03b6\u22121 + \u03b60(z \u2212 t)\n]\nt (\u2202t + \u2202z) +\n[\n1 + 2t2\u03b6 \u20320(z \u2212 t)\n2t\u03b6\u22121\n\u2202t +\n\u03b6 \u20320(z \u2212 t)t\n\u03b6\u22121\n\u2202z\n]\n\u03b5+O(\u03b52) (74)\n4Similar solutions are obtained for \u03b6\u22121 < 0 but with z + t replacing z \u2212 t.\n15\nwhere \u03b6 \u20320(z) \u2261 d\u03b60dz (z). Although V \u03b5 \u00b7V \u03b5 = \u22121 the (t, z) components of V \u03b5 diverge in the limits t\u2192\u221e\nand t \u2192 0. Divergences as t \u2192 \u221e are expected because the dominant term in the electric field is\nconstant, and so the charged continuum is undergoing constant acceleration to leading order in \u03b5.\nAlthough V \u03b5 diverges as t\u2192\u221e, the electric current J\u03b5 \u2261 \u03c1\u03b5V \u03b5 is\nJ\u03b5 = \u03c1\u03b5V \u03b5 = #\u02dcdE\u03b5\n= \u03b6 \u20320(z \u2212 t) (\u2202t + \u2202z) + \u03b5\n\u03b6 \u2032\u20320 (z \u2212 t)\n\u03b6\u22121\n(\u2202t + \u2202z) +O(\u03b5\n2),\n(75)\nwhere (57) has been used. Since J\u03b5 = \u03c1\u03b5V \u03b5, J\u03b5 = O(\u03b50) and V \u03b5 = O(\u03b5\u22121) it follows that the reduced\nproper charge density \u03c1\u03b5 = O(\u03b5). The leading order contribution to \u03c1\u03b5 is obtained by comparing (75)\nwith (74) and using J0 = \u03c11V\u22121 where\nJ\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u03b5nJn, V\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nVn, \u03c1\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b5n\u03c1n (76)\nIt follows that5\n\u03c1\u03b5 = \u03b5\n\u03b6 \u20320\n\u03b6\u22121t\n+O(\u03b52). (77)\nEquation (75) shows that J\u03b5 is bounded to O(\u03b52) as t \u2192 \u221e. The divergence as t \u2192 0 of the\ncoefficient of \u03b5 in equation (74) stems from the square-root term in (67). Evidently, the domain on\nwhich the approximate solution is valid (the half-plane t > 0) is a subset of the domain of the exact\nsolution (the entire (t, z) plane). This is not too surprising since the charged continuum is at rest at\nt = 0 and the leading term J0 in the series for J\n\u03b5 is light-like:\nJ0 \u00b7 J0 = 0.\nThere is no observer frame in which J0 is instantaneously at rest.\nThis simple example suggests that the series\nF \u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nFn, V\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nVn, \u03c1\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b5n\u03c1n\nwhere F\u22121 is an external field (a solution to the source-free Maxwell equations), should be inserted\ninto the field system (52-55) which is then solved order-by-order in \u03b5.\nThis approach can lead to the series expansions for the highly symmetric solutions just discussed,\nbut can also yield \u03b5 expansions for solutions that depend on (x, y) as well as (t, z). A consequence\nof the above series expansions is that the electric 4-current has the form\nJ\u03b5 = \u03c1\u03b5V \u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u03b5nJn.\nIt will be shown below that the above expansions partially decouple the field system (52-55) yielding\nan infinite hierarchy of equations that are amenable to solution when supplemented with appropriate\nboundary conditions and initial data.\n5It should be noted that the equation \u03c1\u03b5 = \u2212J\u03b5 \u00b7 V \u03b5 cannot be used to calculate (77) without first calculating J2\nsince \u03c11 = \u2212(J2 \u00b7 V\u22121 + J1 \u00b7 V0 + J0 \u00b7 V1).\n16\n3 The perturbation scheme\nBased on the above exact symmetric solution it is assumed that there exists a class of solutions\nto (52-55) that represents configurations of charged particles in ultra-relativistic collective motion.\nIt is shown in Appendix A.1 that the notion of an ultra-relativistic 4-velocity vector field can be\nmade precise and should be distinguished from the magnitude of a relative Newtonian speed that\ncan be defined for any two time-like 4-vector fields. An ultra-relativistic velocity field is a pointwise\nlimiting concept that depends on the existence of the forward light-cone structure at each event\nin spacetime. To leading order in the expansion defined below the velocity field of the charged\ncontinuum is light-like. The full series will be considered as an asymptotic expansion for a solution\nto (52-55) and physically represents an ultra-relativistic configuration controlled by the parameter\n\u03b5. Such configurations cannot of course be exhaustive. They are chosen to be representative of the\nclass relevant to charged beams in high-energy accelerators.\nIntroduce perturbation series for (V \u03b5, \u03c1\u03b5, F \u03b5) in \u03b5 of the form\nV \u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nVn , \u03c1\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b5n\u03c1n , F\n\u03b5 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u03b5nFn (78)\nwhere\nVn \u2208 \u0393TM , \u03c1n \u2208 \u0393\u039b0M , Fn \u2208 \u0393\u039b2M (79)\nTheorem 1.

Equations (80-84) are obtained by inserting the series (78) into (52-55) and the integrability\ncondition (56). The hierarchical structure follows by inspection.\n17\nTo illustrate the partially decoupled structure in (85) consider the first 8 steps in detail:\nStep 1: Adopt an external electromagnetic field F\u22121 i.e. a solution of the source-free equations\ndF\u22121 = 0 and d ? F\u22121 = 0. (86)\nStep 2: Solve\n\u2207V\u22121V\u02dc\u22121 = iV\u22121F\u22121 subject to V\u22121 \u00b7 V\u22121 = 0 (87)\nfor V\u22121 6= 0, where F\u22121 is data obtained in the previous step.\nAlthough (87) is non-linear in the unknown field V\u22121 it is straightforward to analyse; it can\nbe written as a quasi-linear second-order ordinary differential equation for the integral curves\nof V\u22121 and is the only non-linear differential equation in this scheme.\nIt may seem that the pair of equations above offer 5 scalar equations for 4 unknown scalars.\nHowever, the contraction of the first equation with V\u22121 identically vanishes, so there are only\n4 independent equations. This can be seen6 by writing (87) with respect to an arbitrary\nbasis and noting that one of the 5 components of (87) is a consequence of the other 4.\nStep 3: The leading order reduced proper charge density \u03c11 is a solution to\nd ?\n(\n\u03c11V\u02dc\u22121\n)\n= 0. (88)\nStep 4: The 2-form F0 is a solution to Maxwell\u2019s equations with the current \u03c11V\u02dc\u22121 as a source:\ndF0 = 0 and d ? F0 = \u2212 ? \u03c11V\u02dc\u22121. (89)\nThe conservation equation (88) ensures that (89) has a solution.\nStep 5: The zero order velocity field V0 is obtained from the linear equations\n\u2207V\u22121V\u02dc0 +\u2207V0V\u02dc\u22121 = iV\u22121F0 + iV0F\u22121 subject to V\u22121 \u00b7 V0 = 0. (90)\nStep 6: The second order coefficient \u03c12 in the \u03b5 expansion for the reduced proper charge density \u03c1\n\u03b5\nsatisfies\nd ?\n(\n\u03c12V\u02dc\u22121\n)\n+ d ?\n(\n\u03c11V\u02dc0\n)\n= 0. (91)\nStep 7: Equation (91) ensures that\ndF1 = 0 and d ? F1 = \u2212 ? \u03c12V\u02dc\u22121 \u2212 ?\u03c11V\u02dc0. (92)\nmay be solved for the coefficient F1 (the first order term in the \u03b5 expansion of F\n\u03b5) given\nappropriate initial and boundary conditions.\nStep 8: The linear partial differential equation for V1 is\n\u2207V\u22121V\u02dc1 +\u2207V0V\u02dc0 +\u2207V1V\u02dc\u22121 = iV\u22121F1 + iV0F0 + iV1F\u22121 subject to 2V\u22121 \u00b7 V1 + V0 \u00b7 V0 = \u22121.\n(93)\n6The split of (87) with respect to the laboratory frame is given in Appendix A.2. The energy balance equation\nobtained from (87) is dropped because it follows as a consequence of the momentum balance equation (118) and the\nconstraint (119).\n18\nV \u03b5 must be calculated to at least first order in \u03b5 to obtain a time-like vector field. To see this\nlet X\u03b5 = \u03b5\u22121V\u22121 + V0 and note X\u03b5 \u00b7 X\u03b5 = V0 \u00b7 V0 using the metric-product conditions in (87) and\n(90). Using lemma 5 in Appendix A.1 V0 \u00b7V0 \u2265 0 and so X\u03b5 is light-like or space-like. Now introduce\nY \u03b5 = X\u03b5 + \u03b5V1 = \u03b5\n\u22121V\u22121 + V0 + \u03b5V1 and note Y \u03b5 \u00b7 Y \u03b5 = V0 \u00b7 V0 + 2V1 \u00b7 V\u22121 +O(\u03b5) = \u22121 +O(\u03b5) using\n(93). Therefore, there exists some value of \u03b5 > 0 for which Y \u03b5 is time-like.\nIt has already been stated that the pair of equations (87) in step 2 may be considered as 4\nnon-linear equations in 4 unknowns. Furthermore:\nLemma 2. The equations in each step 3N + 2, for N \u2265 1, are equivalent to a set of 4 independent\ninhomogeneous linear equations for the 4 unknown components of VN\u22121.\nProof. Step 3N +2 involves solving (82) and (83) for VN\u22121. Assume that the equations in steps 1 to\n3N + 1 have been solved and define Ln as\nLn =\nn\u2211\nr=0\n(\n\u2207Vn\u2212r\u22121V\u02dcr\u22121 \u2212 iVr\u22121Fn\u2212r\u22121\n)\n. (94)\nClearly (82) is equivalent to Ln = 0. The vector fields V\u22121, . . . , VN\u22122 have been obtained in steps 1\nto 3N + 1 and so Ln = 0 for n = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1. It will now be shown that given any VN\u22121 satisfying\n(83) with n = N the scalar field iV\u22121LN identically vanishes.\nFrom (83) for n = 0, . . . , N\n0 = \u2207Vs\n(\nn\u2211\nr=0\nVr\u22121 \u00b7 Vn\u2212r\u22121\n)\n=\nn\u2211\nr=0\n(\u2207VsVr\u22121) \u00b7 Vn\u2212r\u22121 +\nn\u2211\nr=0\nVr\u22121 \u00b7 \u2207VsVn\u2212r\u22121\n=\nn\u2211\nr=0\n(\u2207VsVr\u22121) \u00b7 Vn\u2212r\u22121 +\n0\u2211\nq=n\nVn\u2212q\u22121 \u00b7 \u2207VsVq\u22121\nwhere the second sum has been re-labelled by q = n\u2212 r.

The double summation\nin (96) is over the set {\n(n, s) |n, s \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , N}, n \u2264 s}\n19\nand so\nN\u2211\nn=0\nN\u2211\ns=n\nSns =\nN\u2211\ns=0\ns\u2211\nn=0\nSns\nfor any summand Sns.

Let {X1, X2, X3, X4}, with Xi \u2208 \u0393TM\nfor i = 1, 2, 3, 4, be any vector frame such that X1 = V\u22121 and define {e1, e2, e3, e4}, where ei \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M,\nto be the coframe dual to {X1, X2, X3, X4}:\nei(Xj) = \u03b4\ni\nj\nwhere \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta. Equation (82) can be written as\nL(V\u02dcN\u22121) = \u03beN\u22121 (98)\nwhere L is the R-linear differential operator on \u0393\u039b1M\nL(V\u02dcN\u22121) = \u2207V\u22121V\u02dcN\u22121 +\u2207VN\u22121V\u02dc\u22121 + iVN\u22121F\u22121\nwhere \u03beN\u22121 \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M depends on {V\u22121, V0 . . . , VN\u22122, F0, . . . , FN\u22121} but is independent of VN\u22121.\nHence, using (97)\niX1(L(V\u02dcN\u22121)\u2212 \u03beN\u22121) = iV\u22121(L(V\u02dcN\u22121)\u2212 \u03beN\u22121) = 0 (99)\nLikewise, equation (83) can be expressed as\niX1V\u02dcN\u22121 = iV\u22121V\u02dcN\u22121 = CN\u22121 (100)\nwhere the scalar field CN\u22121 \u2208 \u0393\u039b0M depends only on {V0, . . . , VN\u22122}.\nUsing the coframe {e1, e2, e3, e4}\nV\u02dcN\u22121 =\n4\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbN\u22121,iei\nfor component fields \u03bbN\u22121,i.

All of the remaining equations are linear and therefore, in principle, simpler to solve.\n4 Example : Charged beam propagating in free space\nAs a simple application of the hierarchy (80-84) consider a high-energy charged beam propagating\nin free space. Unlike the exact \u201cwall of charge\u201d solutions derived earlier, the charge distributions\nconsidered here have finite extent transverse to and along the direction of propagation. The first\neight steps of the hierarchy (80-84) are:\nStep 1: The leading order Maxwell field F\u22121 (the external field) is chosen to vanish so (86) is trivially\nsatisfied.\nStep 2: Using (87) the leading order 4-velocity field V\u22121 satisfies\n\u2207V\u22121V\u22121 = 0, V\u22121 \u00b7 V\u22121 = 0 (102)\nsince the external field F\u22121 = 0. Therefore, consider solutions to (80-84) adapted to a null\ngeodesic coordinate system (u, v, x, y) where u = z \u2212 t, v = z + t and\ng = \u2212dt\u2297 dt+ dx\u2297 dx+ dy \u2297 dy + dz \u2297 dz\n=\n1\n2\n(du\u2297 dv + dv \u2297 du) + dx\u2297 dx+ dy \u2297 dy (103)\nwith the spacetime volume 4-form\n?1 = dt \u2227 dz \u2227#\u22a51\nwhere\n#\u22a51 \u2261 dx \u2227 dy.\nThe pair (\u2202t, \u2202z) and their duals (dt, dz) are related to (\u2202v, \u2202u) and (dv, du) as follows:\n\u2202v =\n1\n2\n(\u2202z + \u2202t) , \u2202u =\n1\n2\n(\u2202z \u2212 \u2202t) ,\ndv = dz + dt, du = dz \u2212 dt.\nMetric identities used in the subsequent steps are\n?(du \u2227 \u03b1) = (\u22121)pdu \u2227#\u22a5\u03b1, ?(dv \u2227 \u03b1) = \u2212(\u22121)pdv \u2227#\u22a5\u03b1 (104)\n21\nwhere #\u22a5(\u03b1\u2227 X\u02dc) = iX#\u22a5\u03b1 and \u03b1 is any p-form such that i\u2202u\u03b1 = i\u2202v\u03b1 = 0. The vector field\nV\u22121 is chosen as\nV\u22121 = \u03b3\u22121 (\u2202t + \u2202z)\n= 2\u03b3\u22121\u2202v (105)\nwhere \u03b3\u22121 6= 0 is assumed and, using \u2207\u2202v = \u2207\u2202u = 0, the only non-zero component of (102)\nis\n\u2202v\u03b3\u22121 = 0. (106)\nHence, \u03b3\u22121 is independent of v.\nStep 3: Using (105), equation (88) is\n\u2202v(\u03c11\u03b3\u22121) = 0\nand so, using (106)\n\u2202v\u03c11 = 0.\nIt follows that \u03c11 is independent of v.\nStep 4: Using (104), particular solutions to (89) may be written\nF0 = d\u03a60 \u2227 du (107)\nwhere the scalar potential \u03a60 is chosen to satisfy\n\u2202v\u03a60 = 0, d\u22a5#\u22a5d\u22a5\u03a60 = \u03c11\u03b3\u22121#\u22a51 (108)\nand d\u22a5 is the exterior derivative in the (x, y) plane defined by\nd\u22a5f = \u2202xf dx+ \u2202yf dy\nfor any 0-form f \u2208 \u0393\u039b0M.\nStep 5: Using (90), the equations for V0 are\n\u2207V\u22121V\u02dc0 +\u2207V0V\u02dc\u22121 = iV\u22121F0, V\u22121 \u00b7 V0 = 0\nand are solved by the particular solution\nV0 = 0\nsince iV\u22121F0 = 0 using (107), (108) and (105).\nStep 6: Since V0 = 0 it follows that (91) has the form\nd ?\n(\n\u03c12V\u02dc\u22121\n)\n= 0\nand, using (105) and (106), is solved by any \u03c12 satisfying\n\u2202v\u03c12 = 0\ni.e. \u03c12 is independent of v.\n22\nStep 7: Since V0 = 0 the Maxwell equations (92) are\ndF1 = 0, d ?

Hence, the function \u03b3\u22121 is independent of u and\ntherefore, using (106), \u03b3\u22121 depends only on x and y.\nIn summary these solutions, describing an ultra-relativistic charged distribution propagating along\nthe z-axis with its electromagnetic self-fields, are\nV \u03b5 =\n1\n\u03b5\n2\u03b3\u22121\u2202v \u2212 \u03b5 1\n2\u03b3\u22121\n\u2202u +O(\u03b5\n2)\n=\n(\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03b3\u22121 +\n\u03b5\n4\u03b3\u22121\n)\n\u2202t +\n(\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03b3\u22121 \u2212 \u03b5\n4\u03b3\u22121\n)\n\u2202z +O(\u03b5\n2)\nF \u03b5 = d\u03a60 \u2227 du+ \u03b5d\u03a61 \u2227 du+O(\u03b52)\n= \u2212(d\u03a60 + \u03b5d\u03a61) \u2227 dt+ (d\u03a60 + \u03b5d\u03a61) \u2227 dz +O(\u03b52)\nwhere \u03a60 and \u03a61 satisfy\nd\u22a5#\u22a5d\u22a5\u03a60 = \u03b3\u22121\u03c11#\u22a51, d\u22a5#\u22a5d\u22a5\u03a61 = \u03b3\u22121\u03c12#\u22a51 (112)\nand\n\u03a60 = \u03a6\u02c60(u, x, y), \u03a61 = \u03a6\u02c61(u, x, y),\n\u03c11 = \u03c1\u02c61(u, x, y), \u03c12 = \u03c1\u02c62(u, x, y),\n\u03b3\u22121 = \u03b3\u02c6\u22121(x, y)\nwith u = z \u2212 t. The scalar fields \u03c10, \u03c11, \u03b3\u22121 are determined by their values on the space-like hyper-\nsurface t = 0 given as data.

Pathologies (such as pre-acceleration)\nassociated with radiating point particles are avoided by relying on field-theoretical notions.\nA novel analysis of charged beam dynamics has been presented and a model of a freely propagating\ncharged bunch discussed. The approach relies on an asymptotic series representation of solutions\nto self-consistent spacetime covariant field equations for (V, \u03c1, F ) describing a charged continuum.\nThe asymptotic series for V is based on the light-like vector field V\u22121 leading to an ultra-relativistic\napproximation. The hierarchy of equations obtained are more amenable to analysis than the original\nnon-linear field system and particular solutions have been presented.\nThere are numerous avenues for the development of this work involving ultra-relativistic charged\nbeams in the vicinity of beam pipes, RF cavities, spoilers, etc. leading to dynamical effects that are\noften described in terms of \u201cwake-fields\u201d [8, 9]. This work will lead to a clearer understanding of\nradiation-reaction exhibited by continuum models of charged particle beams.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge support from the Cockcroft Institute and the EU GIFT project (NEST-\nAdventure Project no. 5006) and are grateful to Professor M Poole for enlightening discussions.\n24\nReferences\n[1] L.

For affinely parametrised curves\nthe tangent vector V (4-velocity) is normalised: V \u00b7 V = \u22121. A spacetime reference frame may be\nassociated with a time-like vector field U with U \u00b7 U = \u22121 and an \u201cobserver\u201d in such a frame is\nmodelled by an integral curve of U . The 4-momentum of the particle is defined to be p = m0 V .\nAt an event where an observer curve intersects the world-line of the particle one has the orthogonal\ndecomposition:\np = EU +P\nwhere U \u00b7 P = 0. Relative to U , the scalar E is the energy of the particle (in units with c = 1) and\nP is its 3-momentum. The Newtonian velocity v of the particle relative to U is\nv =\nP\nE = \u2212\nV\nV \u00b7 U \u2212 U (113)\nSince U \u00b7 U = V \u00b7 V = \u22121 implies E2 = P \u00b7 P + m20 it is traditional to say that the particle is\n\u201crelativistic\u201d relative to U if E2 ' P \u00b7 P or equivalently v \u00b7 v ' 1. Clearly, such a notion depends\non both V and U and the nearness of P\u00b7PE2 to unity. Furthermore, one may always find a frame in\nwhich P = 0 and E = m0. However, given a particular frame U one may contemplate a 4-velocity V\nthat is relativistic relative to it. To generalise this notion for any frame one may consider a family\nof 4-velocities V \u03b5 and invoke properties of V \u03b5 as \u03b5 tends to some limit.\n25\nLet \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b5max) = {\u03b5 \u2208 R|0 < \u03b5 < \u03b5max} be the running parameter introduced in the main body\nof the article. A 1-parameter time-like vector field (which is not necessarily normalised) W \u03b5 is\nultra-relativistic if for any time-like vector field Z \u2208 \u0393TM\nlim\n\u03b5\u21920\n( |W \u03b5 \u00b7 Z|\n\u2016W \u03b5\u2016\n)\n=\u221e (114)\nwhere \u2016X\u2016 \u2261 \u221a\u2212X \u00b7X for any time-like (or light-like) vector field X \u2208 \u0393TM. Note that in this\ndefinition Z is not a 1-parameter vector field.\nLemma 3. Our definition of an ultra-relativistic vector field (114) on spacetime is independent of\nthe choice of the time-like vector field Z.\nProof. Clearly (114) is independent of any rescaling of Z. Therefore let Z and Z\u02c6 be two g-normalised\nfuture pointing time-like vector fields (i.e. Z \u00b7 Z = Z\u02c6 \u00b7 Z\u02c6 = \u22121) and define the vector field X1 where\nX1 =\n(Z\u02c6 + (Z\u02c6 \u00b7 Z)Z)\n((Z\u02c6 \u00b7 Z)2 \u2212 1)1\/2 .\nHence\nZ\u02c6 = \u2212(Z\u02c6 \u00b7 Z)Z + ((Z\u02c6 \u00b7 Z)2 \u2212 1)1\/2X1 (115)\nand X1 \u00b7 Z = 0, X1 \u00b7X1 = 1. Choose space-like unit vector fields X2, X3 so that (Z,X1, X2, X3) is a\ng-orthonormal frame. It follows that\nW \u03b5 \u00b7W \u03b5 = \u2212(W \u03b5 \u00b7 Z)2 + (W \u03b5 \u00b7X1)2 + (W \u03b5 \u00b7X2)2 + (W \u03b5 \u00b7X3)2\nwhich implies\n(W \u03b5 \u00b7X1)2\n\u2016W \u03b5\u20162 =\n(W \u03b5 \u00b7 Z)2\n\u2016W \u03b5\u20162 \u2212 1\u2212\n(W \u03b5 \u00b7X2)2\n\u2016W \u03b5\u20162 \u2212\n(W \u03b5 \u00b7X3)2\n\u2016W \u03b5\u20162\nand hence\n|W \u03b5 \u00b7X1|\n\u2016W \u03b5\u2016 \u2264\n|W \u03b5 \u00b7 Z|\n\u2016W \u03b5\u2016 .

The relationship between ultra-relativistic vector fields and\nlight-like limited vector fields is given by the following lemma:\nLemma 4. If W\u03b5 is light-like limited then W\u03b5 is ultra-relativistic. If W\u03b5 is ultra-relativistic and the\nlimit lim\u03b5\u21920W\u03b5 exists and is nowhere 0 then W\u03b5 is light-like limited.\nProof. If W\u03b5 is light-like limited then lim\u03b5\u21920 |W\u03b5 \u00b7 Z| = | lim\u03b5\u21920(W\u03b5) \u00b7 Z| = |W0 \u00b7 Z| > 0 since\nW0 is light-like and Z is time-like. Furthermore, lim\u03b5\u21920(W\u03b5 \u00b7 W\u03b5) = \u2212\u2016W0\u20162 = 0 and so W\u03b5 is\nultra-relativistic.\nIfW\u03b5 is ultra-relativistic and the limitW0 = lim\u03b5\u21920W\u03b5 exists and is nowhere 0 then (sinceW0 \u00b7Z\nis finite) \u2016W0\u2016 must vanish to ensure (114) is obeyed.\nThe 1-parameter family of velocity fields V \u03b5 introduced in the main body of this article (see section\n3) is ultra-relativistic. Moreover, the vector fields V\u22121, V0 and V1 then have certain properties:\nLemma 5.\n\u2022 The 1-parameter family of vector fields V \u03b5 is ultra-relativistic if and only if V\u22121 does not vanish\nanywhere.\n27\n\u2022 If V \u03b5 is ultra-relativistic then V0 is nowhere time-like and V1 does not vanish anywhere.\nProof.\n\u2022 If V\u22121 6= 0 then for any time-like vector Z, V\u22121 \u00b7 Z 6= 0 so\nlim\n\u03b5\u21920\n(|V \u03b5 \u00b7 Z|\/ \u2016V \u03b5\u2016) = lim\n\u03b5\u21920\n(\u03b5\u22121|V\u22121 \u00b7 Z|) =\u221e\nsince \u2016V \u03b5\u2016 = \u22121 and so V \u03b5 is ultra-relativistic. If there is some x \u2208 M such that V\u22121(x) = 0\nthen\nlim\n\u03b5\u21920\n(|V \u03b5(x) \u00b7 Z(x)|\/ \u2016V \u03b5(x)\u2016) = lim\n\u03b5\u21920\n(\u03b50|V0(x) \u00b7 Z(x)|) 6=\u221e\nso V \u03b5 is not ultra-relativistic.\n\u2022 Assume V0 is time-like. Since V \u03b5 is ultra-relativistic it follows V\u22121 6= 0 and, furthermore, since\nV0 is time-like V\u22121 \u00b7 V0 6= 0; however, this conclusion contradicts (90) which states V0 and V\u22121\nare orthogonal. Hence, V0 is not time-like (i.e. V0 is space-like, light-like or zero).\nNow since V\u22121 is light-like and V0 is not time-like then in order to satisfy 2V\u22121 \u00b7V1+V0 \u00b7V0 = \u22121\nfrom (93) V1 does not vanish anywhere.\nA.2 The perturbation hierarchy in Gibbs\u2019 3-vector notation\nTo facilitate a comparison with existing fluid descriptions of beam dynamics [10, 11] that employ\nGibbs\u2019 3-vector notation the equations (52-56) in section 3 are here transcribed into that language.\nBy splitting with respect to an inertial observer field 1\nc\n\u2202t where\ng = \u2212c2dt\u2297 dt+ dx\u2297 dx+ dy \u2297 dy + dz \u2297 dz\none obtains\n\u2207 \u00b7 e = m0c\n2\nq0\n\u03b3\u03c1,\n\u2207\u00d7 b = 1\nq0\n\u03c1p+\n1\nc2\n\u2202e\n\u2202t\n,\n\u2207\u00d7 e+ \u2202b\n\u2202t\n= 0,\n\u2207 \u00b7 b = 0,\n\u03b3\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n+\n(\np\nm0\n\u00b7\u2207\n)\np = q0\n(\n\u03b3e+\n1\nm0\np\u00d7 b\n)\n,\n\u2212 \u03b32 + p \u00b7 p\nm20c\n2\n= \u22121,\nm0\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\u03b3\u03c1) +\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c1p) = 0\n(117)\n28\nwhere a \u00b7 b is the standard Euclidean dot product of two 3-vector fields a and b.
