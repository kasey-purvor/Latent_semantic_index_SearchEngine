For this first issue of the journal,\nhowever, Philip Barker (Associate Editor in\ncharge of reviews) has taken most of the\nburden on himself.\nA trilogy of books on CD-I\nCompact Disc Interactive (CD-I) is a new\nelectronic publishing medium for multimedia\ninformation. Unlike conventional publishing\nmedia such as paper and film, CD-I provides\nan interactive method of accessing stored\ninformation and controlling its subsequent\ndisplay on a TV screen. CD-I revolutionizes\nthe publishing of all sorts of material such as\nmusic, text, images, computer graphics, film\nand video. It also adds many capabilities not\npossible with traditional publication media.\nUntil recently, however, the only widely\navailable textbook on CD-I was Preston's\nCompact Disc-Interactive: A Designer's\nOverview, published in 1988 by Kluwer\nTechnical Books. Now, with the recent\nrelease of CD-I in Europe, three new books\non the technology have become available.\nThey form part of The CD-I Series produced\nby Philips Interactive Media Systems (UK)\nand published by the Addison-Wesley. All\nthree have 1992 imprints.\nIntroducing CD-I (ISBN: 0-201-627-48-5)\nGiven its non-technical approach, this book\nis ideally suited to newcomers to CD-I\ntechnology. It is aimed at a broad audience\nfrom interactive producers and designers to\nall those who might be interested in the\napplications of CD-I as a communication and\nentertainment medium. The aim of the book\nis to provide an overview of CD-I and how\nthis new standard for electronic publishing is\nlikely to influence information provision and\naccess in offices, schools, universities and\nhome environments. The book is organized\ninto four basic sections, plus a case study and\na glossary.\nThe first section deals primarily with some of\nthe many potential uses of CD-I in a number\nof different contexts ranging from training,\neducation and entertainment to corporate\npresentations and information provision for\npoint-of-sale applications. This section also\nexplains the basic nature of interactivity and\nhow CD-I relates to interactive television.\nIn the second section, the multimedia nature\nof CD-I is the focus: the medium allows text,\nsound, static pictures, animations and motion\nvideo to be incorporated and integrated into\nan interactive presentation. Two of the most\nimportant features of CD-I are also emphas-\nized here: the digital nature of each of the\nconstituent media components, and the exis-\ntence of a universal world standard (the\nGreen Book) for CD-I publication and deli-\nvery platforms. The limitations of the finite\ncapacity (650 megabytes) of a CD-I disc are\ndiscussed, and different ways of using the\navailable storage are then outlined.\nThe third section covers the basic steps\ninvolved in designing a CD-I product. Each\naspect of the design process, from product\nconception through to design specification, is\nintroduced and described. Producing a CD-I\ntitle usually requires a multi-disciplinary\nteam with a range of different design and\n72\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\ndevelopment skills, and this section con-\ncludes with a discussion of the importance of\nteamwork and project management.\nThe fourth section describes how a design\nspecification is taken through the various\nphases of development to final production.\nTopics discussed in this section include\ncopyright issues, authoring materials, produc-\ntion libraries, disc building, and develop-\nment-team structure and responsibilities.\nThe case study presented at the end of the\nbook takes the reader through the steps\ninvolved in creating an actual CD-I publica-\ntion {Great British Golf). It describes the\nroles of the different people involved in\nmaking the disc, its basic structure and\ncontent, and all the individual development\nand production processes (authoring, testing,\nmastering, and so on) needed to bring a\ncommercial product to the market.\nThe book provides a very readable introduc-\ntion to CD-I and its applications for those\nwho are still uninitiated into the technology.\nLike the other two book in this series\nreviewed here, it is produced to a high\nstandard (apart from one or two minor\ntypographical errors) and is copiously illus-\ntrated.\nThe CD-I Design Handbook (ISBN: 0-\n201-627-49-3)\nDesigning products for delivery on CD-I is in\nmany ways different from designing for other\npublishing media. This design handbook\ntherefore deals with a range of issues relating\nspecifically to the CD-I design process -\nfrom initial concept through to the beginning\nof production. It is aimed at designers who\nneed to understand what they can do with\nCD-I technology rather than the detailed\ntechnical aspects of how CD-I works.\nThere are ten chapters, an appendix, a\nreading list, a glossary and an index. The ten\nchapters are organized into three broad theme\nareas covering general introductory issues,\ntechnical perspectives, and detailed design\nconsiderations. None of the issues associated\nwith asset or disc production is considered\nsince these form the topic of a companion\nbook (The CD-I Production Handbook - see\nbelow).\nGeneral introductory issues are dealt with in\nthe first three chapters. The topics presented\ninclude an introduction to the features,\nfacilities and potential of CD-I, a description\nof CD-I as an information storage and\ndelivery medium, and a detailed exposition\non how to design for interactivity.\nThe technical perspectives (chapters 4 to 7)\nprovide a more detailed description of the\nnature of CD-I's interactive interface, the use\nof video, image formats and image compres-\nsion. This section also contains an outline of\nthe various audio formats available, and\ngives examples of the different ways of using\nthem. The section ends with more details\nabout the overall CD-I delivery system, and\nhow it works.\nThe final section of the book (chapters 8 to\n10) deals with various issues relating to the\ndesign stages involved in producing a CD-I\ntitle. The topics covered include a detailed\ndescription of the design process, design\nanalysis, prototyping, copyright and legal\nissues, teamwork and management techni-\nques such as developing the production plan,\nproduction scheduling, and budgeting.\nAlthough the further reading section is rather\nsparse (containing only six references) both\nthe appendix and the glossary are very\nuseful. The appendix, for example, provides\na valuable ready reckoner which enables\ndesigners to check that their design will fit\nwithin the storage and bandwidth require-\nments of CD-I.\nThe CD-I Production Handbook (ISBN:\n0-201-627-50-7)\nThis book is intended as a sequel to the\nDesign Handbook reviewed above. It is\n73\nReviews\naimed at those working on the production of\nCD-I titles (whatever their level of involve-\nment) and those who are interested in\ncommissioning CD-I material but are not\nsure about what to expect.\nThere are eleven chapters, logically arranged\ninto five theme areas: the pre-production\nphase of a project (chapters 1 to 3), CD-I\nfacilities (4 and 5), gathering and producing\nCD-I resources (6 to 9), disc building (10),\nand follow-on projects (11). The reading list\nand glossary are essentially the same as those\nof the CD-I Design Handbook.\nThe three chapters that make up the section\ndealing with the pre-production phase are of\nan introductory nature and are concerned\nwith the infra-structure that must be created\nin order to undertake successful CD-I deve-\nlopment. The first chapter covers issues such\nas the relationship between the producer and\nthe client of a product, a description of the\nproduction process itself, and tools for CD-I\nproduction. The second chapter describes in\ndetail the steps involved in setting up a CD-I\nstudio and equipping it, and the nature of the\nhardware, software and human resources\nrequired. The final chapter in this section\ndeals with project management issues such as\nsetting up milestones, defining deliverables,\nscheduling, elapsed time, budgeting and\ncopyright.\nThe first chapter of the second section\nprovides detailed descriptions of CD-I tech-\nnology including the nature of the CD-ROMs\non which interactive materials are published.\nThere are descriptions of the parts of the\nCD-I player, the structure of discs (tracks and\nsectors), seek time, channels and data rate.\nSynchronization, interleaving and real-time\noperation are also discussed. The second\nchapter in this section deals with CD-I\neffects. Beginning with a discussion of\npicture planes and image types (such as\nFMV, RGB, DYUV, CLUT, etc.) it proceeds\nto a description of broadcasting conventions,\nresolution and aspect ratios. Subscreens,\npartial updates and CLUT animation are then\noutlined, and there are descriptions of the\nvarious types of video plane effects such as\ncuts, wipes, fades, dissolves and mosaics.\nThis section concludes with a short descrip-\ntion of audio types and the use of sound-\nmaps.\nThe largest section of the book is the third,\nand it deals with the theme of gathering and\nproducing CD-I resources. The first chapter\nof the section covers four important issues:\nthe coding methods underlying the storage of\nmaterials in digital form on CD-I discs, how\nto generate the right sort of materials from\nscratch, how to convert existing materials\nfrom non-CD-I format, and how to manipu-\nlate and edit materials at different levels of\nauthoring sophistication. The next two chap-\nters deal with authoring and the creation of\nprototypes, authoring software such as\nMediaMogul, and choosing an authoring\nsystem. The section concludes with a particu-\nlarly informative description of program-\nming, concentrating on Philips's CD-I\nAuthor (a programming environment for\ndeveloping CD-I titles), the IMS Program-\nmer's Toolkit, the Balboa Runtime Environ-\nment, CD-RTOS and the OS-9 real-time\nmultitasking operating system.\nChapter 10 (which makes up the fourth\nsection of the book) covers the disc-building\nto disc-pressing stages of CD-I production.\nConsideration is given to a number of\nimportant issues such as the structure and\ncreation of real-time files and the generation\nof CD-I disc images for testing purposes.\nThere is then a discussion of the role of\nemulation (and how it works), followed by a\ndescription of WORM discs and how they\ncan be used for testing and validation. The\nfinal part of this section is concerned with\nthe processes that take place at the CD-I\nproduction plant when the WORM or tape\n74\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nstreamer is used to create a master which is\nthen used for replication purposes.\nThe last section of the book consists of a\nsingle short chapter covering the various\nfactors to be taken into account in anticipa-\ntion of follow-up projects. It discusses issues\nsuch as creating sequels, house style and\nsoftware efficiency through the design of\nre-usable code segments.\nThis book really does contain lots of useful\ninformation for those wishing to find out\nmore about CD-I production: of the three\nbooks in the series reviewed here, I found it\nthe most interesting and instructive.\nAt present there are four planned books in\nthe series - at the time of writing The CD-I\nProgrammer's Handbook has not been\nreleased but is scheduled for publication later\nthis year. Undoubtedly, as CD-I takes off\nthere will be scope for extending the series,\nperhaps with titles such as CD-I in the\nClassroom or CD-I and Higher Education.\nThe Hutchinson Electronic Encyclopedia,\nFirst Electronic Version, Oxford, Random\nCentury and Attica Cybernetics, 1991.\nISBN: 1-873472-00-5. Price \u00a399.\nAttaching a CD player to a personal com-\nputer is now a relatively simple process. So,\nas the cost of such players falls, the use of\nCD-ROM for distributing large volumes of\ncomputer-based multimedia information\nbecomes increasingly attractive, and elec-\ntronic encyclopedias based on CD-ROM are\nnow becoming popular. Compton's Multime-\ndia Encyclopedia and the Grolier Electronic\nEncyclopedia are two examples of this new\ntype of information resource; the Hutchinson\nElectronic Encyclopedia is another.\nThe package consists of a standard ISO 9660\nCD-ROM, a printed manual, and floppy\ndisks (3.5 and 5.25 inch) containing the\ninstallation software. Installation is relatively\neasy, taking only a few minutes. The system\nruns within Microsoft Windows.\nOn start-up you are presented with a Con-\ntents Page designed to give easy access to the\nvarious categories of information available.\nThe Contents Page is framed within a\nstandard Windows setting of a horizontal\nmenu bar, scroll bars, dialogue boxes and\nreactive buttons. It is organized into three\nmajor areas: an eight-option iconic menu\narea, a window for the display of title and\nword indexes, and a horizontal array of 13\nicons.\nThe information within the encyclopedia is\norganized in the form of 'articles', each\nconsisting of just one 'page* of information,\nso pages are of varying length. There are\n25,147 articles listed in the General Index,\nand they are sub-divided into seven basic\nsubject categories: Places (5,040), Science\nand Technology (3,378), History. (1,937),\nBiographies (6,068), Aspects of Society\n(4,279), Life Sciences (3,396) and The Arts\n(1,049). A particular information category is\nmade the current one by clicking on the\nscreen area associated with it, and once one\nof the categories has been selected it can be\nbrowsed through or searched.\nThe icons in the icon array enable you to\naccess the Contents Page from anywhere in\nthe encyclopedia, display any page, examine\nthe next and previous pages, perform word\nsearches, examine the next and previous\nrecords retrieved by a search operation,\ncreate a backtrack list and actually backtrack,\naccess a Notepad facility, print out informa-\ntion in hard copy, and obtain online help. All\nthese facilities are of course augmented by\nthose provided in the standard Windows\nenvironment.\nThere are two basic ways of retrieving\ninformation. The first involves directly\naccessing articles using one of the two\n75\nReviews\nalphabetical indexes (Title and Word). The\nsecond method is based on full-text retrieval\nmechanisms using either a simple or complex\nkeyword search facility. For a simple search\nstrategy, you type in a string of characters\nthat defines a descriptor representing your\ninformation requirement. All the articles\nindexed under this descriptor are then made\navailable for display. If too many articles are\nretrieved, the search can be refined in order\nto reduce the number of hits. For example, a\nsearch for computer retrieves 220 articles;\nrefining the search by also specifying digital\nreduces the number of hits to 20. Complex\nsearches are similar to simple searches except\nthat up to nine keywords can be used\nsimultaneously, each one linked to another\nby means of a logical operator (AND, OR,\nNOT). Examples of complex searches are:\ncomput* AND Babbage AND Turing\n(retrieves one article on the history of\ncomputing); and computer AND digital AND\nNOT optical (retrieves 18 articles about\ncomputers). Unfortunately, many of the com-\nplex queries I tried resulted in that dreaded\nWindows message: 'UNRECOVERABLE\nAPPLICATION ERROR - Terminating Cur-\nrent Application'.\nThat, however, is not my only complaint\nabout this product. It performs too slowly,\nthere are other bugs and errors, and the\nuser-interface is of poor quality. I was also\nvery disappointed by the quality of the\nprinted manual. This is scanty with respect to\nboth size and content. Worse, it fails to\nreflect accurately what happens on-screen\nwhile the encyclopedia is being used.\nThe slowness of the system is apparent in\nthree important areas - initialization, search\ntime and retrieval time. In this context the\nGrolier Encyclopedia outperforms it by a\nlong way. For example, once the Hutchinson\nsystem has been activated by double clicking\non the Hutchinson icon, there is a wait of\nabout 95 seconds before everything is ready\nto go. In comparison, Grolier - running on\nthe same machine (a Viglen 386) and using\nthe same Hitachi CD-ROM drive - takes less\nthan 12 seconds to get going. Grolier's\nsearch and retrieval times are also much\nfaster: the Hutchinson search takes over 27\nseconds to locate a mere 452 references to\nthe term 'Paris'; to perform the same search,\nGrolier takes less than four seconds to locate\n1,425 references.\nEqually irritating are the bugs and inconsis-\ntencies in the Hutchinson package. Examples\ninclude colour smudging on the opening page\nof the encyclopedia and in the photograph of\nJohn Major (Biographies Section), angstrom\nbeing spelled 'a3b3ngstrom' in both the word\nindex and in the article defining the term\n'lumen' (in other places it is spelled cor-\nrectly), picric acid being retrieved by the\nstring 'c6h2' and not by its correct molecular\nformula C6H3N3O7 (which retrieves 'pyro-\ngallol'), and entries in the title index appear-\ning to be correctly capitalized whereas those\nin the word index are all in lower case -\nsomething which makes chemical formulae\nand abbreviations appear unfamiliar.\nThere are many other such little mistakes, but\none of the most unforgivable limitations of\nthe package is the lack of error checking in\nthe underlying control software. For example,\nI started up Hutchinson having inadvertently\nleft my Grolier disc in the CD-ROM drive.\nThe control software gave me no indication\nthat I had an incorrect disc present and it\ntook me a good while to determine why I\ncould not get Hutchinson to work. In\ncomparison, Grolier checks for the presence\nof the correct disc in the CD-ROM drive and\nissues a warning if it is not there.\nIn all, then, I hardly feel I can recommend\nHutchinson to anyone who requires fast and\naccurate access to encyclopedic information\nwhen at least one better alternative is\navailable.\n76\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nRewritable Optical Storage Technology,\nedited by J. Paris Roth, Meckler, West-\nport CT, USA, 1991. ISBN: 0-88736-\n534-5.\nBecause of its reliability, robustness and high\nstorage capacity, read-only optical storage\ntechnology has become an important and\nwell-established component of interactive-\nmultimedia systems. Although potentially as\nimportant, rewritable optical storage is not as\nwell-established, but its use is growing. This\nbook, produced by a group of authors,\nprovides an introduction to the development\nand application of this relatively new\napproach to data and information storage and\nretrieval.\nThere are seven chapters. The first provides\nan overview of rewritable optical storage\ntechnologies: magneto-optical (MO), dye-\npolymer, and phase-change. The merits and\ncurrent de-merits of the most popular of\nthese technologies - MO - are then described\nand a number of commercial products are\ncompared. The need for inter-changeability\nand standards is discussed, and the chapter\nconcludes with an annotated list of over 170\nnames and addresses of organisations cur-\nrently undertaking active research into the\ndevelopment and\/or application of rewritable\noptical storage technology. The second chap-\nter describes how MO storage works and the\nadvantages of this type of technology for\nstorage-intensive applications such as CAD\n(Computer-Aided Design) and CAE (Com-\nputer-Aided Engineering). The benefits and\nuses of MO rewritable, WORM and CD-\nROM storage technologies are then com-\npared, and the chapter ends with a descrip-\ntion of a multifunction (hybrid) optical disc\ndrive that could prove an attractive develop-\nment for future computer systems.\nFollowing the hardware descriptions given in\nthe early part of the book, Chapter 3 deals\nwith some of the important software conside-\nrations relevant to rewritable and multifunc-\ntional optical drives. Issues covered include\nthe software requirements for WORM and\nrewritable media, the need for a universal\nlogical file format for rewritable media, and\nthe Small Computer Systems Interface\n(SCSI). Chapter 4 describes the development\nof a new flexible rewritable storage techno-\nlogy suitable for use in tape and disc drives.\nThe technology is based on the use of dyed\npolymer films for information storage, and a\nweb-coating process for fabrication. The\nattractiveness of this latter process (compared\nwith stamping processes) is that it can lead to\nsubstantial reductions in production costs.\nThe last three chapters of the book deal with\napplications. Chapter 5 covers the end-user\nrequirements for networking an integrated\nrewritable optical disc workstation in order to\nsupport communication, storage and writing\nactivities within a professional workgroup.\nSimilarly, the author of Chapter 6 outlines\nthe requirements of a workstation to support\nforeign-language instruction and how rewri-\ntable optical media could provide many of\nthe required facilities. The final chapter deals\nwith 'surrogate manipulations',, describing\nhow a high-speed workstation fitted with a\nrewritable optical disc could be used to\nprovide a multimedia workstation for the\ncreation and storage of contemporary art\nmaterial using images, text and sound.\nAs well as a subject index, the book contains\ntwo appendices: a list of recommended\nreadings relating to rewritable optical\nstorage, and a glossary of terms and acro-\nnyms.\nThe style and quality of the presentations\nvaries from chapter to chapter. There are also\na number of spelling mistakes and some\nimportant omissions. But the book is in\ngeneral quite interesting, and will undoub-\ntedly serve as a useful introduction for those\nwishing to find out more about the current\n77\nReviews\nstate of the art in the area of rewritable\noptical storage and its applications.\nHypertext: State of the Art, edited by R.\nMcAleese and C. Green, Oxford, Intellect,\n1990. ISBN 1-871516-08-0.\nThere has been growing interest over the last\nfew years in hypertext and hypermedia, and a\nlarge number of commercial products have\nbecome available. These have included appli-\ncations which deliver hypermedia informa-\ntion (for example, electronic books based on\nCD-ROM), and hypermedia creation software\n(for example, authoring systems). This grow-\ning interest has developed from academic\nresearch which started back in the 1940s with\nVannevar Bush and his memex concept.\nMore recently, a great deal of research has\nbeen conducted into hypertext and hyperme-\ndia, and the book reviewed here aims to\ndisseminate some of the findings of this\nresearch.\nIt consists of 29 papers selected from those\nsubmitted to the 2nd UK Human Interface\nInteractive Learning Systems SIG conference\non hypertext held in 1989 at the University\nof York. The principle keynote speaker was\nTed Nelson, and although his speeches are\nnot included in this book, a brief description\nof his contributions is provided in the\npreface.\nThe papers are divided into four basic\nsections: Navigation and Browsing, Hyper-\ntext and Learning, Prototypes, and Designing\nHypertext and Hypertext and Design, each\npreceded by a short description of underlying\nissues.\nThe first section, consisting of nine papers,\naddresses topics such as the use of meta-\nphors, the effects that the underlying struc-\nture can have on navigation tools, and the\nrelationship between navigational aids and\ncontrol structures. Section 2 contains seven\npapers covering the use of hypertext and\nhypermedia within learning applications. The\nreader is led to consider concepts such as\nlearning styles, the degree of learner control,\nuser models, and designing for precise\nlearning outcomes. Section 3 also has seven\npapers and deals with concepts associated\nwith the creation of hypermedia applications.\n. A number of languages and environments are\ndiscussed (for example, HyperCard and Pro-\nlog) along with software maintenance and\ndocument processing. The last section has six\npapers, all dealing with design issues. Two\nbasic approaches emerge: a top-down\napproach, concentrating on the way know-\nledge or information should be represented,\nand a bottom-up approach concentrating on\nthe system and user requirements.\nIn addition to the theoretical treatment of the\nconcepts and ideas relevant to hypertext and\nhypermedia, the papers presented in this\nbook also generally provide the results of\nexperimental work, allowing some quantifi-\ncation of the ideas discussed so that a clearer\npicture of the actual impact of a variety of\nhypermedia features can be assessed.\nThis is not an introductory book. It is aimed\nat people who already have some knowledge\nof both hypertext and research techniques. It\noffers no overall conclusions, and it has the\nfeel of conference proceedings rather than\nthat of a textbook. Nevertheless, the papers\nare of high quality, and the range of topics\ndiscussed makes this an extremely useful text\nfor undergraduates, industry professionals,\nand anyone conducting research and\/or deve-\nlopment of hypermedia applications.\nA hypertext version of a previous book\nedited by Ray McAleese, Hypertext: Theory\ninto Practice (Oxford, Intellect, 1988) is\nprovided free as a Guide Envelope applica-\ntion for the Apple Macintosh.\nStephen Richards, University of Teesside\n78\n"}
