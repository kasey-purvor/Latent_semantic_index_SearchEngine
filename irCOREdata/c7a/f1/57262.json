Introduction\n35 [2] The ongoing eruption of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano\n36 (SHV) on Montserrat began on 18 July 1995 [Young et al.,\n37 1998] and has involved three major episodes of lava dome\n38 growth: the first from 15 November 1995 to 10 March 1998\n39 [Norton et al., 2002; Sparks et al., 1998]; the second from\n40 November 1999 until 28 July 2003 [Herd et al., 2005]; and\n41the third from 1 August 2005 until 20 April 2007. A fourth\n42episode of dome growth began in August 2008. Monitoring\n43the extrusion rate of the lava and volumetric and morpho-\n44logical changes of the growing lava dome at SHV are critical\n45to the effective assessment of volcanic hazards, particularly\n46pyroclastic flows, surges and explosions [Calder et al., 2002;\n47Sparks et al., 1998; Watts et al., 2002].\n48[3] This paper focuses on the third episode of lava dome\n49growth. It was notable for the highest recorded lava extru-\n50sion rates to date, the fewest significant dome collapses (and\n51associated pyroclastic flows) and a lack of hybrid earth-\n52quake seismicity [Luckett et al., 2008]. We describe the\n53methods used by Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) to\n54assess dome volume and extrusion rate, discuss pyroclastic\n55flow and tephra volumes, and show how morphological and\n56dynamic variations in lava dome growth are related to\n57extrusion rates and volume.\n582. Methods\n59[4] Four methods were used to assess lava dome volume\n60during the third episode of dome growth: 1) a terrestrial\n61photo\u2010method; 2) ground\u2010based LiDAR [Jones, 2006]; 3) a\n62prototype ground\u2010based radar (AVTIS: All\u2010weather Volcano\n63Topographic Imaging Sensor [Robertson and Macfarlane,\n642006; Wadge et al., 2005, 2008], and 4) an empirical meth-\n65od that uses photographs of dome profiles and assumes pro-\n66portionality between the pixel area of an image of the dome\n67and the volume of the dome (not considered further here). The\n68first three techniques measure the coordinates of points on the\n69growing lava dome and enable the generation of a 3D surface\n70representing the dome and talus. Only the terrestrial photo\u2010\n71method was used regularly. Spatial coordinates of points on\n72the dome were calculated from oblique\u2010view digital image\n73pairs taken from known locations on the same day with a\n74camera that had been pre\u2010calibrated using the MATLAB\u2122\n75camera calibration toolbox available at http:\/\/www.\n76vision.caltech.edu\/bouguetj\/calib_doc\/index.html. Volca-\n77nic hazards prevented the deployment of control point tar-\n78gets, so camera orientations were calculated using features\n79in the images that had been coordinated by theodolite\n80measurements. Data were processed using in\u2010house soft-\n81ware based on the MATLAB camera calibration toolbox.\n82[5] A Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT with a Canon EFS\n8318\u201355 mm zoom lens set at the 18 mm position was used to\n84take all photographs. A set of 25 photographs of a flat chess\n85board in different orientations were the input data for the\n86camera calibration. The details of camera calibration are\n87described by Zhang [2005]. The use of the intrinsic camera\n88model generated by camera calibration increased the accu-\n89racy of the photo\u2010method.\n1Montserrat Volcano Observatory, Flemmings, Montserrat.\n2British Geological Survey, Keyworth, UK.\n3Now at Institute of Earth Science and Engineering, University of\nAuckland, Auckland, New Zealand.\n4British Geological Survey, Edinburgh, UK.\n5Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\n6Department of Geology, State University of New York at Buffalo,\nBuffalo, New York, USA.\n7Environmental Systems Science Centre, University of Reading,\nReading, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2009GL041477$05.00\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, LXXXXX, doi:10.1029\/2009GL041477, 2010\nLXXXXX 1 of 5\nAr\ntic\nle\nin\nPr\noo\nf\n90 [6] The coordinates produced by the photo or LiDAR\n91 methods were interpolated using Kriging algorithms in\n92 ArcGIS9 to create a 3D represen ation of the dome. The\n93 resulting digital elevation model was compared visually to\n94 photographs of the dome and minor changes were made to\n95 the model to obtain a good match (Figure 1). Each succes-\n96 sive model could then be subtracted from the previous one\n97 to yield a volume change.\n98 [7] Each of the volume increments includes dense and\n99 vesicular lava, numerous shear and fracture zones and talus.\n100 Following the methodology of Sparks et al. [1998], the\n101 MVO has over the years calculated DRE by assuming an\n102 average 13% vesicularity and 3% void space in talus, giving\n103 a multiplicative correction factor of 0.844 to convert from\n104 measured dome volume to dense rock equivalent (DRE).\n105 The bulk vesicularity and pore space in the dome (including\n106 talus) vary through time and cannot be measured, there is\n107 therefore considerable uncertainty. We use these values so\n108 that volumes and extrusion rates can be compared to pre-\n109 viously published data. Wadge et al. [2010] used slightly\n110 different bulk densities and pore space assumptions in their\n111 estimates for the whole eruption.\n112[8] The volume of pyroclastic flow deposits was esti-\n113mated from field measurements where possible or calculated\n114from an empirical relationship (with upper and lower bounds)\n115between runout distance and volume established byCalder et\n116al. [1999]. Conversion to DRE volumes was made assuming\n117that dense andesitic lava has a density of 2600 kg\/m3 and the\n118bulk density of pyroclastic flow deposits is 2000 kg\/m3 (i.e.,\n119using a conversion factor of 0.77 as used by Sparks et al.\n120[1998]). Ash fall deposits were assumed to comprise an\n121additional 15% of the pyroclastic flow deposit DRE volumes\n122[Sparks et al., 1998]; although detailed analysis [Bonadonna\n123et al., 2002] suggests that this is a maximum estimate.\n1243. Data Limitations\n125[9] The photo\u2010method described is similar to the photo-\n126graphic method used by Sparks et al. [1998] for the first\n127episode of lava dome growth but the use of a calibrated\n128camera lens and the more precise determination of mea-\n129surement points from digital images rather than from printed\n130film increases the accuracy of the three dimensional point\n131measurements. Nevertheless, photographic surveys of the\nFigure 1. Total extruded magma volume (DRE) during the third episode of dome growth. Total volume is the sum of\nmeasured lava dome volume and volume of pyroclastic flow and associated ash deposits. Error bars reflect a 15% error\ndominated by systematic errors. The horizontal central lines in magma extrusion rates (DRE) are average rates over the\nperiods between dome volume measurements. The grey shading indicates errors associated with extrusion rates (see text).\nThe 20 May 2006 dome collapse is represented by a sharp decrease in dome volume around that date. The extrusion rate for\nthe period between 18 May 2006 and 20 May 2006 was estimated at the average rate for the dome growth episode up to that\ntime (3.7 m3s\u22121). There are no error bars associated with this estimate on the graph and it has the appearance of a vertical\ndark line in the extrusion rate graph.\nRYAN ET AL.: EXTRUSION RATES AT SOUFRI\u00c8RE HILLS LXXXXXLXXXXX\n2 of 5\nAr\ntic\nle\nin\nPr\noo\nf\n132 lava dome could only be carried out from two locations on\n133 the south and southeast sides of the crater so detailed sur-\n134 veys of the western and northwestern sides of the dome were\n135 not possible. Systematic error arises from the interpolation\n136 of the western side of the dome and uncertainty due to the\n137 assumptions of bulk density of the deposits. Systematic\n138 errors on the final interpolated volumes are estimated to be\n139 about 15% [Sparks et al., 1998]. Random error is controlled\n140 by the errors in the dome point coordinate estimates which\n141 are of the order of 1 m. Assuming the dome is roughly\n142 hemispherical, the random error in the measured dome\n143 volume (sV) can be estimated by:\n\u0001V \u00bc 2\u0003\u0001Xffiffiffinp 3V\n\u0003\n2\u0003\n\u0004 \u00052=2 \u00f01\u00de\n144 where sX is the coordinate error (\u223c1 m), n is the number of\n145 point measurements on the dome surface and V is the esti-\n146 mated volume of the dome.\n147 [10] The error on the change in extruded magma volume\n148 between measurements (sDV) is given by the following\nequation:\n\u0001\u0002V \u00bc \u00f0\u0001V2\u00de2 \u00fe \u00f0\u0001V1\u00de2 \u00fe \u00f0\u0001VPF1\u00de2 \u00fe \u00f0\u0001VPF2\u00de2\nh i\n\u00f02\u00de\n149 where sV2 and sV1 are the random errors on the dome vol-\n150 ume estimates and sVPF1 and sVPF2 are the errors on the\n151 pyroclastic flow volume estimates. Errors in extrusion rate\n152 will be dominated by random (rather than systematic) errors\n153 in dome volume estimates and errors in pyroclastic flow\n154 volume estimates.\n155 [11] The error on the estimated extrusion rate is given by\n156 the following equation:\n\u0001Q \u00bc Q \u0001\u0002V\n\u0002V\n\u0006 \u00072\n\u00fe \u0001\u0002t\n\u0002t\n\u0006 \u00072\b \t1=2\n\u00f03\u00de\n157Surveys of the dome were achieved on average once every\n158two weeks due to infrequent helicopter access and low\n159cloud. As a result, short\u2010period variations in extrusion rate\n160were not possible using either the LiDAR or photo\u2010method.\n161When operational, a permanently mounted mm\u2010wave radar\n162AVTIS 2, could potentially produce daily variations in\n163extrusion rate [Wadge et al., 2008].\n1644. Volumes and Extrusion Rates\n165[12] The total cumulative lava extrusion during the third\n166episode of lava dome growth is calculated as the sum of the\n167lava dome (including talus), pyroclastic flow and ash fall\n168deposit volumes (all converted to DRE) at the times of the\n16921 surveys (Table 1 and Figure 2). The total volume of\n170magma produced during the third episode of lava dome\n171growth was 306 \u00b1 51 Mm3 based on the following: a total\n172measured volume of extruded lava using the photo and\n173LiDAR methods of 256 Mm3 \u00b1 38 Mm3; a total volume of\n174pyroclastic flow deposits (not including those associated\n175with the 20 May 2006 event) using Calder et al.\u2019s [1999]\n176method of 14\u201367 Mm3 (av. 40 Mm3) and a tephra fall\n177volume of 2\u201310 Mm3 (av. 6 Mm3).\n178[13] From the 21 surveys the DRE average extrusion rates\n179have been calculated for 20 intervals (Table 1). The third\n180episode of lava extrusion began with low average extrusion\n181rates (up to 0.5 m3s\u22121), increasing to \u223c2 m3s\u22121 on 13 October,\n182an increase to \u223c4 m3s\u22121 in mid\u2010December and a significant\n183increase on 10 February 2006 when the dome had reached a\n184volume of about 25 Mm3 DRE (Figures 2 and 3). Interest-\n185ingly, a similar pattern of increasing flux occurred during\n186growth of the first dome [Sparks et al., 1998].

Therewere periods of several dayswith no visible\n195 dome growth (<0.5 m3s\u22121) and periods of several weeks at\n196 10 m3s\u22121 and above. Survey intervals typically varied from\n197 2 to 4 weeks, so shorter period extrusion rate variations are\n198 not represented in Table 1. For example, visual observations\n199 found no dome growth from 29 January to 9 February 2006\n200 or from 24 to 25 February so the average rate for the period\n201 27 January to 27 February (Table 1) was >12 m3s\u22121 and the\n202 peak rate for 10\u201312 February may have exceeded 20 m3s\u22121.\n203 [14] A LiDAR survey of the lava dome was carried out on\n204 18 May 2006, and then the entire dome and parts of the\n205 crater floor and rim collapsed on 20 May 2006. Extrusion\n206 began again at a moderate rate on the same day, probably\n207 because there was only minimal involvement of the conduit\n208 during the collapse [Luckett et al., 2008]. This was the only\n209 significant lava dome collapse during the whole dome\n210 growth period. Pyroclastic flows with measured volume\n211 >1 Mm3 occurred on only two other occasions: 30 June\n212 2006 (\u223c2 Mm3) and 8 January 2007 (a single flow of 5 Mm3\n213 and later discrete but persistent flows with a combined\n214 volume <5 Mm3). Smaller pyroclastic flows with volumes\n215 <1 Mm3 occurred on 149 separate days.\n216 5. Discussion\n217 [15] Episode three was characterised by a tendency for the\n218 lava dome to grow very large with relatively few small to\n219 moderate block\u2010and\u2010ash flows, and yet shear lobes and\n220 other morphological features developed in the same way as\n221 the first episode of lava dome growth and with the same\n222 relationship to extrusion rates [Watts et al., 2002]. Extensive\n223 talus slopes developed but derived mainly from degassed\n224 dome rock in rockfalls [Wadge et al., 2009]. During periods\n225 of high magma supply rate the extrusion of lower viscosity\n226 \u2018pancake\u2019 lobes [Watts et al., 2002] tended to restore the\n227 sometimes irregularly\u2010shaped edifice to a more symmetrical,\n228flat\u2010topped \u2018dome\u2019. This process may, at times, have con-\n229tributed to the dome\u2019s overall stability.\n230[16] Both the first and third episodes were preceded by\n231about 4 months of phreatic activity showing similar surface\n232responses to events at depth. At the beginning of episode\n233three, average extrusion rates remained low (<0.5 m3s\u22121) for\n23474 days and produced 2.5 Mm3 DRE of magma, remarkably\n235similar to the first dome growth episode in which slow\n236growth (<0.6 m3s\u22121 DRE) lasted 77 days [Sparks et al.,\n2371998] and produced about 2.2 Mm3 magma (Figure 3).\n238This behaviour during the first episode was interpreted by\n239Sparks et al. [1998] as being caused by degassed, highly\n240viscous magma that had been infilling the conduit for sev-\n241eral months before extrusion began, inhibiting the flow rate.\n242Assuming a cylindrical conduit of diameter 30m [Devine et\n243al., 1998; Melnik and Sparks, 1999] these magma volumes\n244would fill the conduit to a depth of <3.5km. Alternatively,\n245Costa et al. [2007] and Hautmann et al. [2009] suggest a\n246model in which a cylindrical conduit at the surface becomes\n247a dyke at depth which would decrease this estimate. Episode\n248three was shorter than episode one (627 and 846 days\n249respectively) and average and peak extrusion rates were\n250higher, implying a high magma driving pressure. High\n251extrusion rates during episode one were linked to pulses of\n252volatile\u2010rich magma [Sparks et al., 1998; Voight et al.,\n2531999]. The high numbers of long\u2010period rockfall and\n254rockfall seismic events in April\u2013May 2006 implied high gas\n255pressures consistent with high sulphur dioxide emissions\n256during the 20 May 2006 dome collapse [Loughlin et al.,\n2572006]. During a peak in activity on 8 January 2007, some\n258erupted pumice contained >6 wt% H2O, the highest\n259recorded in the whole eruption [Humphreys et al., 2009]\n260implying that the link between volatile content and extrusion\nFigure 3.

The major dome col-\nlapse and explosion in 17 September 1996 [Robertson et al.,\n1998] caused the subsequent temporary decrease in magma\nflux.\nFigure 2.
