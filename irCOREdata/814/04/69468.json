San-Jose, E. Prada, E. McCann, and H. Schomerus\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\n(Dated: June 18, 2009)\nWe propose a non-magnetic, pseudospin-based version of a spin valve, in which the pseudospin\npolarization in neighboring regions of a graphene bilayer is controlled by external gates. Numerical\ncalculations demonstrate a large on-off ratio of such a device. This finding holds promise for the\nrealization of pseudospintronics: a form of electronics based upon the manipulation of pseudospin\nanalogous to the control of physical spin in spintronics applications.\nPACS numbers: 75.70.Ak, 75.47.Pq, 85.75.-d\nSoon after its discovery [1], it was realized that\ngraphene supports an additional quantum number called\npseudospin [2, 3, 4] that arises because the honeycomb\nlattice is composed of two triangular sublattices. Wave-\nfunction amplitudes can be written like the two compo-\nnents of a spin-1\/2 elementary particle, and electrons in\ngraphene display characteristics analogous to relativistic\nfermions [2, 3]. In particular, this includes the celebrated\neffect of chirality, whose profound consequences include\nan unusual sequencing of plateaus in measurements of the\nquantum Hall effect [2, 3, 5], suppression of backscatter-\ning [6, 7] and Klein tunneling at interfaces [8, 9].\nSo far, it has not been possible to exploit the pseu-\ndospin degree of freedom in graphene in a similar way\nas physical spin in spintronics [10] and quantum com-\nputing [11] applications. In a monolayer of graphene,\nchirality means that the orientation of an electron\u2019s pseu-\ndospin is inextricably linked to the direction of its mo-\nmentum, thus constraining the pseudospin to lie in the\nplane of the graphene sheet and preventing its use as an\nindependently-tunable degree of freedom. In bilayers of\ngraphene [5, 12, 13], the pseudospin degree of freedom is\nassociated with the electronic density on the two layers.\nThe constraint of chirality entails that electronic den-\nsity is equally divided between the two layers so that the\npseudospin again lies in the plane of the layers but now\nturning twice as quickly as the direction of momentum\n[5, 12]. Min et al [14] were the first to realize that bilayers\nstill offer a promising platform for pseudospintronics. In\nparticular, they predicted that a pseudomagnetic state\ncan form spontaneously due to strong Coulomb interac-\ntions at vanishing charge-carrier density; this effect is\nintimately tied to the fact that the density of states re-\nmains finite because the dispersion relation is parabolic,\nin contrast to the situation in a monolayer.\nIn this Letter we propose a variant of graphene-based\npseudospintronics which exploits another direct advan-\ntage of a bilayer over a monolayer, namely the facil-\nity to induce a difference between the on-site energies\non the two layers via a perpendicularly applied electric\nfield, which can be realized by pairs of gate electrodes\n(see Fig. 1). The resulting asymmetry of the layers in-\nduces an energy gap between the conduction and valence\n2|U|\nFIG. 1: Pseudospin-valve effect in bilayer graphene.\nSchematic diagram of a pseudospin valve in bilayer graphene\nin its antiparallel (AP) configuration.\nbands [12, 15, 16, 17], as observed in photoemission [13]\nand transport [18, 19] measurements. For states above\nor below the gap, interlayer asymmetry has the effect\nof creating an \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d component of pseudospin\nperpendicular to the electronic momentum and the plane\nof the sheet [12, 14]. The electric field hence acts on the\npseudospin in the same way as a magnetic field acts on\nthe physical spin of electrons in spintronic applications.\nIn particular, the preferred pseudospin direction can be\nswitched by inverting the sign of the applied potential\ndifference. In analogy to the giant magnetoresistance\n(GMR) induced by a domain wall boundary in magnetic\nmaterials [20, 21], one would therefore expect that in-\nterfaces between regions of different gate polarity inhibit\nthe flow of electrons. We will demonstrate that this ef-\nfect can indeed be utilized to realize an all-electronic,\npseudospin-based analogue of a spin valve with a large\non-off ratio.\nConcepts.\u2014The proposed pseudospin valve can be re-\nalized in a 2D sheet of bilayer graphene with sets of gates\nwhich produce a spatial variation of interlayer asymme-\ntry in the direction of current flow (see Fig. 1). Top and\nbottom gates are used to independently control the Fermi\nar\nX\niv\n:0\n90\n1.\n08\n89\nv2\n  [\nco\nnd\n-m\nat.\nme\ns-h\nall\n]  \n18\n Ju\nn 2\n00\n9\n2FIG. 2: Schematical illustration of a pseudospin-valve tran-\nsistor. This device is operated by switching the polarity of a\ncentral gate of length l (shown is the antiparallel configura-\ntion).\nlevel and the interlayer asymmetry, the latter creating an\nout-of-plane component of pseudospin. When the polar-\nity of the two pairs of gates is identical, the device is\nin its \u201cparallel\u201d configuration, and offers only a small\nresistance to the flow of electrons with energies above\nthe gap. The illustration in Fig. 1 shows the device in\nits \u201canti-parallel\u201d configuration, which is realized when\nthe polarity of the gates changes sign across the device.\nThis produces a corresponding rotation of the pseudospin\npolarization with a switching of the out-of-plane compo-\nnent. Similarly to spin scattering at domain walls [21],\nthe pseudospin of an incoming electron will precess about\nthe changing local polarization as it attempts to follow it.\nIf the change in the polarization rotation is sharp enough,\nthe re-alignment of the electron\u2019s pseudospin should only\nbe partially successful, leading to reflection and a drop\nin the flow of current through the device.\nWe characterize the fidelity of the pseudospin valve in\nterms of the pseudo-magnetoresistance (PMR) ratio\nPMR =\nRAP \u2212RP\nRAP\n, (1)\nwhich is defined by the resistances RP (parallel config-\nuration) and RAP (antiparallel configuration) determin-\ning the current I = V\/R flowing through the device in\nresponse to an applied bias voltage difference V . The\nPMR resistance ratio is the analogue of the conservative\ndefinition of magnetoresistance in spintronic applications\n[10, 21], and takes the value 100% for a perfect spin valve.\nAs in conventional spintronic applications, we also con-\nsider how the pseudospin-valve effect can be extended to\na broader range of energies via serial connection of re-\ngions of different polarity. This leads to the design of\na pseudospin-valve transistor operated by switching the\npolarity of a central gate of length l (shown in Fig. 2).\nNumerical results.\u2014We start with numerical results,\nwhich are based on the microscopic tight-binding model\nof bilayer graphene. This model offers an accurate de-\nscription of electronic transport in terms of a small num-\nber of characteristic energies and length scales.

In a bilayer, the two sheets of carbon\nare arranged according to Bernal stacking, whereby half\nof the atoms are strongly coupled to an atom in the other\nlayer, with a strength determined by the interlayer cou-\npling parameter \u03b31 \u2248 0.39 eV. Additional next-nearest\nneighbor couplings are non-essential for the problem at\nhand, and are therefore neglected for simplicity.\nIn the parallel configuration, the spatially constant on-\nsite potential takes the value Utop = U0 in the top layer\nand Ubottom = \u2212U0 in the bottom layer. In the anti-\nparallel configuration of the device we model the on-site\npotential by\nUtop(x) = \u2212Ubottom(x) = U(x) \u2261 \u2212U0 erf(x\/d), (2)\nwhere erf is the error function and x is the coordi-\nnate in the direction of transport. The main design pa-\nrameters of the pseudospin valve are the typical length\nscale d of variation of the gate potential and the mag-\nnitude U0 of the potential value at large distance, as\nwell as the Fermi energy EF which determines the en-\nergy at which the electrons are injected from the elec-\ntrodes (EF = 0 for a charge-neutral gapless bilayer). In\nthe parallel configuration, the presence of a homogeneous\nsymmetry-breaking onsite potential opens an energy gap\n2|U0|\/\n\u221a\n1 + (2U0\/\u03b31)2 around the Fermi energy of the\ncharge-neutral bilayer (see again Fig. 1). For the an-\ntiparallel configuration with the inhomogeneous poten-\ntial U(x) of Eq. (2), the solution of the tight-binding\nmodel requires, in general, a numerical approach.\n3Since U is y\u2212independent, the problem of an infinitely\nwide ribbon is separable, and electronic modes with fixed\ntransverse wavenumber ky decouple. For each transverse\nmode, the problem can be reduced to a one-dimensional\nchain of coupled bilayer unit cells, where each unit cell is\ncomposed of four carbon atoms. The Green function of\neach chain can be computed efficiently using the recursive\nGreen function technique [22], which delivers the trans-\nmission amplitude t(ky) via the Fisher-Lee formula [23].\nIn the linear response regime, the total phase-coherent\nconductance of the nanoribbon is then obtained from the\nLandauer formula. For a ribbon of finite width W , the\nfollowing considerations remain valid as long as W \u001d d\nand kFW \u001d 1, so that the contribution of edges can be\nneglected (see the discussion at the end of the paper).\nThe calculated conductance versus Fermi energy is\nshown in the inset of Fig. 3 for the parallel configura-\ntion, as well as the antiparallel configuration with one\nor two interfaces. In these calculations, the interface pa-\nrameters are d = 50 a and d = l = 50 a, respectively, and\nthe asymptotic gap is U0 = 0.07 eV, corresponding to pa-\nrameters which can be realized in present bilayer exper-\niments [13, 19]. We find that close to the band edge the\nconductance in the antiparallel configuration is strongly\nreduced below its value in the parallel configuration. The\nresulting PMR ratio is plotted in the main panel of Fig.\n3. For energies just above the gap, the PMR peaks at\n100%. For increasing Fermi energy the resistance ratio\ndrops, which can be attributed to the decreasing out-of-\nplane component of the pseudospin of incoming electrons\nas they become less sensitive to the asymmetry of the lay-\ners when their kinetic energy increases. As expected from\nthe GMR analogy, the presence of a second interface in\nthe pseudospin-valve transistor (dashed line) significantly\nextends the energy range over which the PMR is \u2248 100%.\nAnalytical considerations.\u2014A qualitative analysis of\nthe pseudospin-valve effect can be achieved by consid-\nering the low-energy physics of gapped graphene bilay-\ners. The microscopic tight-binding Hamiltonian delivers\na band structure with four bands. For realistic values\nof the charge carrier density, the Fermi surface of bi-\nlayer graphene lies in the vicinity of two valleys, indexed\nby \u03be = \u00b11, situated at the K and K\u2019 point at the cor-\nners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Owing to the in-\nterlayer coupling, two of the bands are split away by an\nenergy \u2248 \u00b1\u03b31. For the interlayer asymmetries and Fermi\nenergies |U0|, |EF | \u001c \u03b31 assumed in this work, these\nsplit bands do not contribute to the electronic transport.\nIn the absence of layer asymmetry, the two remaining\nbands touch at zero energy and have an approximately\nparabolic dispersion relation E \u2248 \u00b1p2\/2m, with effec-\ntive mass m = \u03b31\/2v20 and corresponding Fermi velocity\nvF \u2248 2v0\n\u221a|E|\/|\u03b31|.\nTo explain the influence of interlayer asymmetry, we\nemploy a two-component Hamiltonian [12] that approx-\nimately describes the electronic behavior in these two\nlow-energy bands,\nH2 \u2248 \u2212 12m\n(\n0 (\u03bepx \u2212 ipy)2\n(\u03bepx + ipy)\n2 0\n)\n+\n(\nU 0\n0 \u2212U\n)\n.\nThe effective Hamiltonian H2 operates in a space of two-\ncomponent wave functions \u03a8 describing electronic am-\nplitudes on the top and bottom layers. The first term in\nthe Hamiltonian corresponds to a pseudospin-orbit cou-\npling and ensures chirality of the electronic states in the\nabsence of a symmetry-breaking on-site potential. The\nsecond term in H2 takes into account the influence of ex-\nternal gates that produce different on-site energies \u00b1U\non the two layers. This term is analogous to the Zeeman\nenergy of a physical spin in a magnetic field parallel to\nthe z direction and leads to a gap 2|U | in the electronic\nspectrum E\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1\n[\nU2 +\n(\np2\/2m\n)2]1\/2. The pseudospin\npart of the corresponding wave functions takes the form\n\u03a8\u00b1 =\n1\u221a\n2\n( \u221a\n1 + U\/E e\u2212i\u03be\u03c6\n\u2213\u221a1\u2212 U\/E ei\u03be\u03c6\n)\n,\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle of the momentum in the plane p =\n(p cos\u03c6, p sin\u03c6). The pseudospin of such a state is\n\u3008\u03c3\u3009 = \u2213\n\u221a\n1\u2212\n(\nU\nE\n)2\n(\u02c6\u0131 cos 2\u03c6+ \uf6be\u02c6 \u03be sin 2\u03c6) + k\u02c6\nU\nE\n.\nFor energy near the vicinity of the gap |E| \u2248 |U |, the out-\nof-plane component takes its maximum value \u3008\u03c3z\u3009 \u2248 1,\nwhereas it is reduced away from the gapped region.\nThe pseudospin-valve effect proposed in the present pa-\nper originates in the large resistance at interfaces between\nregions of opposite preferred pseudospin direction. This\nresistance arises because the pseudospin degree of free-\ndom can adjust itself to such a spatial variation only over\na distance ls = hv0\/\n\u221a|E\u03b31|, as follows from the scaling\nof the different terms in the two-component model. This\npseudospin precession length scale is comparable to the\nFermi wavelength, which is the scale on which chirality\nis established in the symmetric bilayer.\nIn both devices studied, the amount of reflection of\nincoming electrons in the anti-parallel configuration will\ntherefore depend on the sharpness of the interface d as\ncompared to the pseudospin precession length ls. Figure\n4 shows the computed dependence of the resistance ratio\non d for fixed values of EF = U0 = 0.07 eV. For these pa-\nrameters, the pseudospin precession length ls \u2248 165 a. In\nthe regime d\/ls < 1 of an abrupt interface, the electron\u2019s\npseudospin is not able to rotate quickly enough to accom-\nmodate the change, which causes reflection and a large\nspin-valve effect. The series connection of two interfaces\nin the transistor further increases the resistance ratio to\nalmost 100%, except for very small values of d where the\nresistance in the antiparallel arrangement drops due to\ntunneling through the central region.

The Fermi energy\nis set to EF = U0 = 0.07 eV.\nlimit d\/ls \u001d 1, the pseudospin of incoming electrons is\nable to adiabatically adapt itself to the change of local\npolarization. In this limit the pseudospin-valve effect be-\ncomes negligible both for the single interface as well as\nfor the series connection of two interfaces. The numerical\nresults confirm that the transition between both regimes\noccurs at d \u2248 ls. The pseudospin-valve effect can there-\nfore be realized in devices with gate separation d of the\norder of a few tens of nanometers.\nDiscussion and Conclusions.\u2014The large mobility of\ncharge carriers in graphene has stimulated intense re-\nsearch efforts that aim at the realization of graphene-\nbased electronic devices. In particular, manipulation\nof the differential population of valley states in mo-\nmentum space has been proposed [24], leading to a\n\u201cvalleytronic\u201d analogy of spintronics. Our proposal of\nbilayer-based pseudospintronics relies on differential pop-\nulation of atomic orbitals in real space. This offers a ro-\nbust mechanism to exploit spintronic analogies without\nthe necessity of carefully fabricated nanoribbon edges,\nwhich limit the scalability of valleytronics [25] and in-\nduce harmful intervalley scattering [26].\nIn particular, pseudospintronics relies on bulk effects\nwhich do not depend on the crystallographic orientation\nof the interface. For the wide samples considered here\n(W \u001d \u03bbF ' ls >\u223c d), effects from the sample edges can\nbe neglected since (i) edge states are localized at real-\nistic rough edges, (ii) hypothetical clean edges at most\ncontribute an additional transport channel per spin, and\n(iii) intervalley scattering off the edges can contribute\nto pseudospin relaxation across the interface, but this\neffect is negligible for d \u001c W . Pseudospintronics is\nalso remarkably robust against bulk disorder. Chirality\nguarantees that the bulk pseudospin-flip rate for major-\nity carriers in a clean ballistic bilayer is zero (the out-of\nplane polarization of the pseudospin in the leads is valley-\nindependent). The predominant scattering mechanism\nin graphene, Coulomb scattering off charged impurities,\ndoes not break chirality [27, 28]. Inter-valley scattering\ncontributes to pseudospin-flip scattering in the interface\nregion, but the scattering lengths lKK\u2032 ' 500nm reported\nin recent experiments [29] indicates that this does not add\nan additional constraint on d.\nAdditional advantages of the proposed bilayer pseu-\ndospintronics concept arise from the fact that the charge\ncarrier densities are finite. In devices that involve po-\nsitioning the Fermi level within the bandgap, includ-\ning field-effect transistors [18] or valley filters based on\ntopologically-confined channels between insulating re-\ngions [30], the effective gap size is reduced by screening\n[16, 17]. Under these conditions, the largest gaps ob-\nserved so far in experiment are of the order of 2U0 \u2248\n10 meV \u2248 100 K [18]. A finite charge density ad-\nmits far larger gaps with experimental values reaching\n2U0 \u2248 200 meV\u2248 2000 K [13, 19] at high density.\nWe thank V. I. Fal\u2019ko and C.
