INTRODUCTION \nRecent publications have considered the relative \nmerits of battery technologies and have reported that a \nkey problem with the use of lead acid batteries (the \ncurrent favoured solution on the basis of cost) as the \nmain energy store within hybrid vehicles, is that they \nare subjected to high charge and discharge rates when \nunder partial state of charge (SoC) conditions. This \nleads to sulphate build-up, cyclic wear, and ultimately, \nto failure [1, 2].  In this paper, therefore, the mitigation \nof such problems is considered using \u2018intelligent \ncontrol\u2019 techniques to better utilize the battery and, \nthereby, enhance performance and longevity. \nThis paper investigates the integration of a cascaded \nH-bridge multilevel converter with real-time battery \nmanagement to control SoC. The cascaded H-bridge \nconverter facilitates superior electrical output behaviour \nwith reduced current ripple, when compared to \ntraditional six-switch inverter solutions.  \n \nIII.  MULTILEVEL CASCADED H-BRIDGE \nThe cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter \ntopology, Fig. 1, is formed by the series connection of a \nnumber of full H-bridge converters. This topology \nnaturally isolates each battery cell facilitating battery \nmanagement, for use in applications such as the hybrid \nvehicle where isolated battery cells are available. \nEach H-bridge cell is capable of producing 0, +Vcell or \n-Vcell, with or without pulse width modulation. The \noutput of the converter is the contribution from all the \nindividual cells.  \n                                                          \nThis work was supported by the UK EPRSC via the provision of a \nresearch studentship. \nThe reduced voltage levels produce more accurately \nsynthesized output waveforms with lower harmonic \ndistortion reducing filtering requirements, and switch \nvoltage stresses. These more widely known advantages \nto the multilevel topology are reported in literature [3, \n4].   \nCurrent ripple and its minimization is an important \nfactor in traction applications, where the associated \ntorque ripple is undesirable. The reduction in voltage \nlevels reduces the voltage seen by the inductive load \nand therefore current ripple. To achieve this with the \nstandard 2-level converter would require an increase in \nswitching frequency and associated switching losses. \nThis leads to the multilevel converter being suitable for \nlow inductance machines [5], or for reducing current \nripple in standard machines [6]. \nThis paper specifically investigates the battery \nmanagement aspects afforded by isolation of the battery \nsources. \nCell A\nCell B\nCell C\nVcellA\nVcellB\nVcellC\nVo\nIo\n \nFig. 1. 7-level cascaded H-bridge \n  Integrated multilevel converter and battery \nmanagement \nK.

PROTOTYPE SYSTEM \nA.  Prototype Hardware \nA BLDC drive system is realized with \u2018intelligent\u2019 \nH-bridge cells performing SoC estimation and capable \nof producing PWM. These, combined with a phase \ncontroller, achieve current control and battery \nmanagement. For comparison purposes, and as a proof \nof principle, only one phase is controlled in this manner, \nwith a 6-switch inverter then providing commutation, \nreducing the phase requirement of the multilevel \nconverter whilst facilitating the battery management.  A \nblock diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2. \n \n \nPM\nMotor\nH Bridge \nCell 2\nCurrent Feedback\nEncoder\nDemand\nCommutation and Hardware Current limitingMultilevel Converter for current control\nH Bridge \nCell 3\nPhase\nController\n \nFig. 2. Prototype BLDC drive system \n \nExperimental results are obtained from a prototype 7-\nlevel multilevel converter using 3\u00d712V, 45Ah lead acid \nbatteries, driving a 1.2kW BLDC machine. The \nexperimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. The BLDC \nmachine is used in a dynamometer rig, with a brushed \nDC machine and resistive load. \nThe prototype uses three identical cells on a common \nSPI interface bus, providing a modular, easily \nexpandable system. \nEach H-bridge cell comprises of an embedded micro-\nprocessor (PIC18F2431) producing PWM, sampling cell \nvoltage and current whilst performing SoC calculation. \nThe switching devices used are the FQA170N06 rated at \n60V, 170A, an opto-isolated communication bus, power \nsupplies and protection circuitry. \nThe phase controller is based on a dsPIC30F4011, \nwhich calculates the required cell states and duty cycle \nfor a given demand signal and maps this to the cell \npriority based on the battery management algorithm. An \nRS232 link is implemented so cell voltage, current and \nthe current integration can be communicated to \nSimulink, which acts as a data logger, and Stateflow, \nwhich implements the various battery management \ntechniques. \n \nB.  SoC Estimation \nSoC estimation in the form of current integration is \nimplemented on each of the H-bridge cells. This is \ncommunicated to the phase controller and passed on to a \nPC, which performs the battery management using \nStateflow.  \nInitial SoC is estimated from the open circuit cell \nvoltage before testing begins. A linear first order \napproximation of a lead acid model, consisting of a bulk \ncapacitance and series resistance, is used in the initial \nSoC estimate, and is a simplification of Randles\u2019 model \npresented in  [7]. The model parameters are obtained \nfrom experimental drive cycle data. The SoC is then \ncalculated in Simulink using the estimated initial SoC \nand current integration value. \nUltimately the battery management will be \nimplemented on the phase controller, producing a \nsystem that incorporates battery management but the \nonly user required input is that of an analogue demand \nsignal. \n \n \nFig. 3. 7-level prototype hardware \n \nV.  BATTERY MANAGEMENT  \nThe hybrid electric vehicle utilizes a series \nconnection of batteries to form a battery pack. The \nelectrical performance of this pack can deteriorate over \ntime when exposed to differing charge and discharge \nrates as well as SoC variations within the pack. \nMethods for charge balancing within a multilevel \nconverter are presented in [8]. These are extended in [6] \nwith the application of SoC estimation and investigated \nwith simulations.  \nWithout battery management the cells will discharge \nunequally with the cell producing the lowest levels \ndischarging most quickly with no account being made \nfor initial conditions.  \n \nA.  Balanced Discharge \nThe first method investigated here is that of balanced \ndischarge or cell rotation where the load to each cell is \nbalanced by rotating the demand between the available \ncells. This is shown in Fig. 4(a). Literature suggests \nrotating the demand every half cycle of the output \nfrequency, when producing AC waveforms, to balance \nthe load. However, with a DC load, and due to the large \nelectrical time constant of the lead acid battery, it has \n757\n been found beneficial to perform the rotation at 30s \nintervals.  \nBalanced discharge, Fig. 4, equalizes the load to each \nbattery, as demonstrated by the parallel SoCs, but does \nnot take into account initial conditions. Cell C has the \nlowest SoC at the beginning and end of the test. \n \nB.  SoC Based Scheme \nThe variation of SoC due to initial conditions can be \nreduced with a SoC based scheme, where the SoC is \ntaken into account and the cell with the lowest SoC is \nused last, thus equalizing the SoC before applying a \nbalanced discharge. This is shown in Fig. 4(b) where the \ncells SoC converge. When cells become equal the \ndemand is rotated between them thereby balancing the \ndischarge. \nThe output of the converter is adjusted for both the \nbalanced discharge and SoC based scheme to produce a \nnominal DCLink current of 10A. \n \n \nVI.  COMPARISON WITH 2-LEVEL CONVERTER  \nTo demonstrate the improvements achievable with \nthe multilevel converter, the classical 2-level converter \nis presented for comparison. The motor phase current is \nadjusted to give the same current, Fig. 5, for both \nconverters. The power delivered to the load is 166W. \nFig. 5 also demonstrates the current ripple reduction by \nvirtue of using smaller voltage levels in the multilevel \nconverter when compared to a classical 2-level system. \n \n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 0.012\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nTime (S)\nPh\nas\ne \nA\n M\not\nor\n C\nur\nre\nnt\n (A\n)\nMotor Phase Current for both 2 & 7-level Converters\n \n \n2-level\n7-level\n \nFig. 5. Motor phase current with 2-level and 7-level converters \n \n    1)  2-level Converter \nFirst the effects of differing initial conditions and cell \ndeterioration are investigated with the classical 2-level \nconverter. The battery cells are connected in series to \nform the DC link for a standard 2-level converter, the \nsame switching frequency, 20kHz, being used for both \nconverters. \n The battery used in cell A is aged and offers a \nreduced capacity to that of cells B and C. The battery \ncells voltage current and estimated SoC is shown in Fig. \n6(a). \n \n    2)  7-level Converter \nUnder the same conditions the 7-level converter test \ndata is shown in Fig. 6(b). \n \nThe initial SoC differs with both types of converter, \nhowever, with the 7-level converter they are equalized \nafter 19min of operation, whereas with the 2-level \nconverter they remain different. In the 2-level converter \nthe lower capacity cell A fails, the cell voltage falls \nrapidly, after 55min of operation. This is extended to \n~76min with the 7-level converter with the failure being \ngradual as the load is balanced between cells.  \n The battery management using the 7-level converter \ncan be extended further by taking remedial action \nshould any cell degrade. That cell can then be bypassed \nand the demand rotated between the remaining available \ncells. The maximum output will be reduced but the \ndrive can continue to operate. \n \n \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0\n5\n10\n15\nC\nel\nl V\nol\nta\nge\n (V\n)\n7-Level Converter with Balanced Discharge Battery Management: IDC Link = 10A\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0\n5\n10\n15\nC\nel\nl C\nur\nre\nnt\n (A\n)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0.6\n0.9\n0.8\n1  \n0.5\n0.7\nC\nel\nl S\noC\nTime (min)\n \n \nCell A\nCell B\nCell C\n(a) \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0\n5\n10\n15\nC\nel\nl V\nol\nta\nge\n (V\n)\n7-Level Converter with SoC Based Battery Management: IDC Link = 10A\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0\n5\n10\n15\nC\nel\nl C\nur\nre\nnt\n (A\n)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nC\nel\nl S\noC\nTime (min)\n \n \nCell A\nCell B\nCell C\n(b) \nFig. 4.

DISCUSSION \nExperimental results presented here use different \nbattery management techniques, both of which offer \nimprovements over the cascaded H-bridge without \nmanagement. Balance discharge between cells is \nachieved, before improvement, with a SoC based \nscheme that is capable of equalizing SoC before \nbalancing the discharge.  \nThe proposed 7-level BLDC drive, incorporating \nbattery management, has been demonstrated to increase \nbattery running time over the classical 2-level converter. \nExtensions to this work include the performing of \nremedial action should any cell fail, and improvements \nto SoC estimation, using observer techniques, to track \nthe initial SoC and to take into account variation of cell \nparameters. \n Further work will investigate the transfer of energy \nbetween cells, to facilitate an off-line equalization and \ncell conditioning routine, as well as the application of \nbattery management techniques to battery charging. \nIX.  CONCLUSIONS \nImprovement in battery performance has been presented \nin the cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter when \ncompared with the classical 2-level converter. This was \ndemonstrated by showing reduced variation between \ncells with real-time battery management techniques. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC for \nsponsoring this work as part of a PhD study. \nREFERENCES \n[1] L.
