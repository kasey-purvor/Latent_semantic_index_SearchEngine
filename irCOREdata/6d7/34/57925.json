Here, the \nhydrological and TCA fluxes through 22 in situ soil columns in a forest and moorland-covered \ncatchment and an agricultural grassland field in Scotland were monitored every two weeks for \nseveral months either as controls or in TCA manipulation (artificial dosing) experiments. This \nwas supplemented by laboratory experiments with radioactively-labelled TCA and with \nirradiated (sterilised) soil columns. Control in situ forest soil columns showed evidence of net \nexport (i.e. in situ production) of TCA, consistent with a net soil TCA production inferred \nfrom forest-scale mass balance estimations. At the same time, there was also clear evidence of \nsubstantial in situ degradation within the soil (~70% on average) of applied TCA. The \nlaboratory experiments showed that both the formation and degradation processes operate on \ntime scales of up to a few days and appeared related more with biological rather than abiotic \nprocesses. Soil TCA activity was greater in more organic-rich soils, particularly within forests, \nand there was strong correlation between TCA and soil biomass carbon content. Overall it \nappears that TCA soil processes exemplify the substantial natural biogeochemical cycling of \nchlorine within soils, independent of any anthropogenic chlorine flux.  \n \nKeywords:  trichloroacetic acid; TCA; soil lysimeter; microbial biomass; degradation;  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe sources, sinks and effects of trichloroacetic acid (TCA: CCl3COOH) in terrestrial and \nfreshwater environments continue to generate debate. The two central issues are the extent of \nTCA\u201fs toxicity to trees and aquatic life at the concentrations measured in the environment, and \nthe extent to which processes involving man-made chlorinated compounds contribute to these \nmeasured concentrations. In the past, TCA and its derivatives were used as herbicides (Lockart \net al., 1990), but current interest in TCA dates from the 1990s when a number of studies \nreported an association between concentrations of TCA in conifer foliage (in the range of tens \nof g kg\n-1\n) and measures of tree ill-health (e.g. Frank et al., 1990; Frank et al., 1994; \nPl\u00fcmacher and Schr\u00f6der, 1994). At the time it was postulated that TCA in foliage derived \nentirely from oxidation of industrial chlorinated solvents, either within the atmosphere or after \npartitioning into the foliage, but it has since been argued that the flux of TCA from this source \n 3 \ncannot account for the observed concentrations of TCA in foliage, rainwater and soil (Jordan \net al., 1999; McCulloch, 2002; Hoekstra, 2003; Folberth et al., 2003).  \n \nAttempts at simple mass closure calculations using field measurements imply that soil-related \nprocesses are key to understanding the biogeochemistry of TCA (Hoekstra et al., 1999b; \nSch\u00f6ler et al., 2003; Stidson et al., 2004a). This is supported by observations from laboratory \nexperiments. For example, using model soil systems, TCA has been shown to be produced \nboth by chloroperoxidase enzymes acting on aliphatic and humic acid substrates (Haiber et al., \n1996; Hoekstra et al., 1999a; Niedan et al., 2000; Matucha et al., 2007) or entirely by abiotic \nchemistry (Fahimi et al., 2003). On the other hand, there is also evidence that TCA applied to \nsoils is readily destroyed (e.g. Heal et al., 2003a; Matucha et al., 2003a; Dickey et al., 2004; \nMatucha et al., 2007). The uncertainty in understanding soil-TCA relationships is exacerbated \nby the intrinsic heterogeneity of soil and associated difficulties in controlling soil parameters \n(Laturnus et al., 2005), and the use of different analytical methods which quantify different \nfractions of TCA within the soil (Dickey et al., 2005). Resolving the uncertainty is important \nbecause controlled experiments confirm TCA\u201fs toxicity to trees and aquatic macrophytes at, or \nclose to, environmental concentrations (Schr\u00f6der et al., 1997; Cape et al., 2003; Dickey et al., \n2004; Hanson and Solomon, 2004; Lewis et al., 2004), and consequently TCA is subject to \nformal risk assessment (Peters, 2003).  \n \nThe work reported here included in situ measurements and manipulations to interpret soil TCA \nfluxes within a small catchment consisting predominantly of moorland and Sitka spruce \nplantation in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, UK. The annual external fluxes of TCA into \nand out of the catchment (via wet and dry deposition, and streamwater discharge, respectively) \nhave been discussed previously (Stidson et al., 2004a), as has TCA cycling through the forest \ncanopy (Stidson et al., 2004b). Two observations from this year-long monitoring programme \nprovide strong indirect evidence for within-catchment production of TCA, associated with \norganic-rich forest soil in particular: \n(1) About one-third of TCA deposition to the forest canopy did not appear in throughfall, \nstemflow or litterfall (Stidson et al., 2004b), yet total TCA fluxes into and out of the \ncatchment as a whole were at steady state, to within the estimated uncertainties (Stidson et al., \n2004a). The observed annual loss of TCA via the forest canopy was ~800 g m\n-2\n, implying \nthat ~300 g TCA is generated annually in situ within the forested area of 0.41 km\n2\n to yield \nsteady state overall (Stidson et al., 2004b).   \n 4 \n(2) The concentration of TCA in catchment streamwater was consistently higher after the \nstream had passed through the forest than before, as illustrated in Fig. 5 of Stidson et al. \n(2004a). Combining the median increase in TCA concentration in the stream (~0.35 g L\n-1\n, n \n= 26) with its annual discharge (~1.4  10\n6\n m\n3\n) yields an estimate for annual net TCA \nproduction in the forest soil of ~500 g.  \n \nBoth estimation methodologies give reasonable consistency in magnitude, as well as sign, for \nthe extent of net production of TCA within the forest soil at whole-forest scale. The study also \nshowed that total catchment burden of TCA was dominated by the soil component and that \nthis was approximately six times the annual external flux (Stidson et al., 2004a) which further \nsuggests that soil-TCA relationships are important to TCA biogeochemistry. Thus the aim of \nthis work was to undertake a series of experiments with intact soil columns both in situ and in \nthe lab to probe further the soil-related TCA processes inferred from the catchment-scale \nobservations. The following hypotheses were investigated: soil TCA fluxes inferred at \ncatchment scale are observable at the soil column scale; TCA is both produced and degraded \nwithin soil; and production and loss of TCA in soil cores is linked with biological processes \nassociated with the soil organic matter and microbial biomass content. \n \nExperimental \n \nField sites, soils and soil properties \nThe 0.86 km\n2\n Ballochbeatties catchment in the Southern Uplands of SW Scotland  (4 29  W, \n55 13  N) which was the focus of this work has been described previously by Heal et al. \n(2004) in respect of hydrological closure, and by Stidson et al. (2004a; 2004b) in respect of \ncatchment and forest scale TCA input\/output measurements made two-weekly for one year. \nThe catchment ranges in altitude from 300-480 m with the upper part consisting of Molinia \nmoor and the lower part of forest plantation of predominantly Sitka spruce with the remainder \nmainly larch. Mean annual rainfall is ~2000 mm. Soils are organic-rich throughout comprising \nbasin peat (77-99% dwt organic matter), peaty podzol (25-50% dwt OM) and peaty gley (14-\n45% dwt OM). Quoted ranges reflect variation in measured OM content, primarily relating to \ndifferent horizons. An agricultural grassland site in SE Scotland (3 12  W, 55 13  N), with \nmineral gleysol (5-8% dwt OM) and mean annual rainfall of ~900 mm, was also used for some \ncomparison experiments. The soil dry and organic matter masses were determined by drying at \n 5 \n60 C, and subsequent ignition in a furnace at 550 C for 8 h, respectively. These and other \nsoil data are given in Table S1. \n \nA measure of the microbial biomass carbon content of the soil was determined using the \nmethodology of chloroform fumigation and extraction with potassium sulphate (Vance et al., \n1987). In brief, 20 g samples of fresh soil were fumigated with chloroform for 24 h in a \nbeaker, shaken for 30 min with 100 mL of 0.5 M K2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was acidified \nwith concentrated phosphoric acid, purged for 5 min with oxygen-free nitrogen and analysed \nusing a total organic carbon analyser (Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80, Santa Clara, Ca., USA). \nOrganic carbon values were corrected using non-fumigated controls and converted to biomass \ncarbon by dividing by 0.35 to account for non-extractable biomass carbon (\u00d6hlinger, 1995).  \n \nAnalysis of TCA \nThe concentration of TCA in all samples was determined using thermal decarboxylation to \nCHCl3 and quantification by headspace GC-ECD. Details of the methodology as applied here \nto soil and aqueous samples have been extensively reported elsewhere (Heal et al., 2003b; \nHeal et al., 2003a; Dickey et al., 2004; Stidson et al., 2004a; Stidson et al., 2004b; Dickey et \nal., 2005). In brief, water or sieved soil samples were sealed in 20 mL headspace vials and \nheated at 100 C for 1.5 h to effect decarboxylation, and re-equilibrated at 60 C before CHCl3 \ndetermination on a DB5 column held at 50 C. Any background CHCl3 was accounted for by \ndetermining CHCl3 in a parallel vial of sample equilibrated to 60 C only. Quantification of \nTCA in water samples was achieved directly against a series of standard TCA solutions taken \nthrough the same process. For soil samples, a partition ratio, the ratio of the response factor of \nstandard additions of TCA to a soil matrix relative to the response factor of aqueous TCA \nstandards, was determined. Each sample was analysed in triplicate. If RSD exceeded 30%, \nreplication was repeated until this criterion was met. The limit of detection was ~0.1 g L\n-1\n. \n \nWhen evaluating TCA in environmental samples it should be borne in mind that \nconcentrations determined in aqueous samples will include the acetate form within the \ndetermination of TCA. Methods of soil analysis that are based on decarboxylation to \nchloroform, as is the case here, will also quantify \u201ebound\u201f TCA, that is to say TCA that is not \nsusceptible to aqueous extraction and which would not be quantified in soil analyses based on \naqueous extraction. \u201eBound\u201f TCA may also include other soil material that contains a \n 6 \nC=O.CCl3 functional group which undergoes decarboxylation to CHCl3 under the analysis \nconditions, i.e. between 60 and 100 C.  \n \nIn situ soil lysimeter studies \nTwenty-two lysimeters were established at the Ballochbeaties and agricultural sites (15 and 7, \nrespectively) by inserting lysimeter pots (diameter 190 mm, depth 140 mm) into the ground so \nthat the upper surface of the intact soil core was level with the ground surface. Holes in the \nbottom of the pots enabled vertical drainage of soil water into an underlying void where it \ncollected in large plastic bags. After a settling in period of a few weeks the volume and TCA \ncontent of collected lysimeter water was measured every two weeks for 7 months (Dec-Jul). \nTwo broad categories of in situ lysimeter experiment were conducted (see Table 1):   \n(1) No chemical manipulation. Four lysimeters received only ambient input of wet deposition \n(moorland lysimeters 1&2) or forest throughfall (lysimeters 3&4 under larch and Sitka spruce \ncanopies); a further six lysimeters received additional deionised water every two weeks to \nserve as \u201cwetted\u201d controls for the TCA-treated lysimeters (lysimeters 6&7 under Sitka spruce \ncanopy, lysimeter 5 on the moorland, and lysimeters 8-10 in the agricultural soil). \n(2) Deliberate TCA treatment. Twelve lysimeters received two-weekly doses of TCA solutions \nof different concentrations (lysimeter 11 on the moorland, lysimeters 12-18 under Sitka spruce \ncanopy, and lysimeters 19-22 in the agricultural soil), as detailed in Table 1. \nIn all cases, ambient rainfall\/throughfall hydrological and TCA inputs were taken as those \nmeasured at nearby wet deposition\/throughfall gauges. The artificial TCA dose was chosen to \nensure that two-weekly leachate concentration would be substantially greater than background \nleachate concentration if applied TCA washed through, or that total soil TCA concentration \nafter ~7 or more TCA applications would be substantially greater than background soil \nconcentration if the applied TCA accumulated in the soil. For the TCA-dosed lysimeters (13-\n22), leachate was collected for 6 or 7 two-week periods prior to the start of TCA dosing, and \nfor a subset of these lysimeters (nos. 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21) leachate continued to be collected \nafter TCA dosing ceased. Initial and final soil TCA concentrations were measured for the \nmajority of lysimeters. \n \nSterile soil column experiments \nSub-samples of soil from the Sitka forest (O horizon, 10-20 cm) and larch forest (O horizon, \n7-20 cm) were sterilized with 27-35 kGy of \n60\nCo gamma irradiation (Ethicon Ltd., Edinburgh). \nSix soil cores were then established for each soil type (3 sterilized and 3 non-sterilized) by \n 7 \nfilling a pot of depth 12 cm with approximately 350 g soil. The cores were kept in an unheated \ngreenhouse. On day zero, 4 g TCA in 80 mL deionised water was added to each core. On day \n2, when a volume of leachate sufficient for TCA analysis had accumulated in the bag beneath \neach core, a new bag was attached and 50 mL of ultrapure water was added to prevent drying \nof the soil and to flush out any further TCA. Further additions of ultrapure water were repeated \non days 6, 8, 9, 14, 16 and 23. \n \nTCA production experiments \nTo investigate within-soil production of TCA, soil from the O horizons (5-20 cm) of the \nafforested and moorland areas of the Ballochbeatties catchment were made TCA-free by \ndrying at 60 C for 8 day and 100 C for 2 h to decarboxylate TCA already present (Dickey et \nal., 2005), then rewetted with either deionised water or 7.6 mg L\n-1\n sodium chloride solution, \nstored in an unheated greenhouse and soil TCA concentrations re-measured after 1, 28 and 54 \ndays.   \n \nTCA fate experiments with [1,2-\n14\nC] TCA  \nExperiments were conducted at 20  2 C, in duplicate, with soils from the following \nlocations: Sitka forest (basin peat O1 and O2 horizons, 10-20 cm and 20-50 cm, respectively), \nlarch forest (peaty gley, B horizon, 12-34 cm) and moorland (peaty podzol, B horizon, 25-30 \ncm). Fresh soil was homogenised by sieving through a 2 mm mesh and 0.5 mL of 430 kBq \nmL\n-1 \nradioactively-labelled [1,2-\n14\nC] TCA (>98% radiochemical purity, specific activity 3.7 \nGBq mmol\n-1\n) was applied to 50 g samples, equivalent to the addition of ~380 ng TCA (g fwt \nsoil)\n-1\n. Each soil sample was mixed for several minutes and transferred to a 500 mL \nErlenmeyer flask, which was connected to a moistened continuous airflow (60 cm\n3\n min\n-1\n) and \nupstream and downstream CO2 absorption solutions of 1 M KOH, as described in Matucha et \nal. (2003a). The contents of the two downstream CO2 absorbers were collected after 1 h, and \nthen twice a day until the rate of degradation changed little between sampling periods (7\u201310 \ndays). The solutions were combined and 1 cm\n3\n mixed with 5 cm\n3\n of Optiphase \u201cHiSafe\u201d 3 \nscintillation cocktail (LKB, Loughborough, UK) for \n14\nC analysis using a liquid scintillation \nspectrometer (Beckman LS 6500, Fullerton, Ca., USA). Radioactivity balance was confirmed \nthrough quantification of \n14\nC remaining in the soil at the end of the experiment. \n \nResults and discussion \n \n 8 \nHydrological and TCA output\/input ratios for lysimeters and soil cores \nMean  1 SD cumulative hydrological outputs from the moorland and forest lysimeters were \n0.74  0.07 (n = 4, lysimeter nos. 1, 2, 5 & 11) and 0.94  0.13 (n = 11, lysimeter nos. 3, 4, 6, \n7 & 12-18) of their respective hydrological inputs from wet deposition and throughfall. (A \ntabulated summary is provided in Table S2 of the supplementary material.) The lower \nhydrological ratio for the agricultural lysimeters of 0.33  0.03 (n = 7, lysimeter nos. 8, 9, 10 \n& 19-22) is due to greater water loss by evapotranspiration in the drier climate. Although \nhydrological output\/input ratios are well-characterised on average (Heal et al., 2004), there is \nconsiderable uncertainty in the hydrological ratios for individual forest lysimeters, and hence \nalso in the TCA mass ratios determined from the water volumes, because of the inherent \nspatial heterogeneity in throughfall. This is not an issue for the moorland and agricultural \nlysimeters since hydrological input is expected to be more spatially homogeneous.  \n \nFor control lysimeters that were not artificially dosed with TCA, the mean  1 SD cumulative \noutput\/input ratios of TCA over 7 months for the moorland, forest and agricultural locations \nwere 0.96  0.08 (n = 3, lysimeter nos. 1, 2 & 5), 1.20  0.09 (n = 4, nos. 3, 4, 6 & 7) and 1.10 \n 0.14 (n = 3, nos. 8-10), respectively (Tables 1 & S2). These data provide direct evidence for \nnet production of TCA, on average, from the forest lysimeters compared with the moorland \nlysimeters (p = 0.008, unpaired t-test). As described in the Introduction, estimated generation \nof TCA in the forest soil during the year of measurements was ~800 g m\n-2\n, which combined \nwith average below-canopy throughfall of ~1600 g m\n-2\n (Stidson et al., 2004b), gives an \nexpected average soil lysimeter TCA output\/input ratio of ~2400\/1600 = 1.5. Thus, although \nnet TCA production in the forest soil has been confirmed, these experimental data values do \nnot fully account for the total net in situ TCA production inferred from the catchment scale \nmeasurements. This is likely because much TCA production is associated with mycorrhizal \ncommunities at the tree root-soil interface (Laturnus et al., 2005) which were not present in the \nlysimeters.  \n \nThe TCA-dosed lysimeters, on the other hand, show unequivocal evidence of in situ TCA \ndegradation in all soil locations examined, with mean cumulative output\/input ratios for \nmoorland, forest and agricultural locations of 0.12 (n = 1, lysimeter no. 11), 0.30  0.06 (n = 7, \nnos. 12-18) and 0.28  0.11 (n = 4, nos. 19-22), respectively (Tables 1 & S2). The input TCA \nthat does not appear in lysimeter leachate does not accumulate in the soil of the lysimeter. \n 9 \nThere was no significant change in soil TCA concentration from start to finish for any \nlysimeter (Figure S1), whether control or dosed (except for one agricultural soil control \nlysimeter in which soil TCA concentration decreased). This is the case irrespective of the \ndifferent intrinsic TCA content of the two types of soil used. Furthermore, the soil TCA \nconcentrations determined in this work are \u201cwhole soil\u201d rather than extractable only (Dickey et \nal., 2005), which indicates non-recovered TCA must undergo chemical transformation rather \nthan irretrievable binding within the soil matrix.  \n \nEvidence for the dynamics of in situ TCA production and degradation is obtained from \nevaluation of the time series of the lysimeter leachates through the pre-dosing, dosing and \npost-dosing regimes. The output\/input TCA time series for the six TCA-dosed lysimeters in \nforest soil (two levels of TCA dosing) are shown in Figure 1. The equivalent time series for \nthe four TCA-dosed lysimeters in agricultural soil are shown in Figure S2; the behaviour was \nsimilar and consistent with first-order kinetics with respect to applied TCA. The average \nleachate TCA concentrations for each phase of the lysimeter experiments are summarised in \nTable 2. During the pre-dosing period, TCA leachate concentrations were similar in all \nlysimeters of a given soil type, confirming the absence of intrinsic bias between lysimeters \nassigned as control or dosed. The TCA concentrations in the control lysimeter leachates \nremained constant throughout. Since hydrological fluxes were similar through all lysimeters of \na given soil type (although different between soil types: mean hydrological recoveries for \nforest and agricultural lysimeters were 0.94 and 0.33, respectively, as noted above), the \nrelative TCA concentrations in the leachates of lysimeters in a given soil type are a proxy for \nthe relative TCA fluxes through the lysimeters in different phases of the experiment. For both \nforest and agricultural soil lysimeters, the TCA concentrations in high-dosed lysimeter \nleachate (during dosing) were significantly greater than in low-dosed lysimeter leachate, \nwhich in turn were significantly greater than in control lysimeter leachate (Table 2). For the \nagricultural soil lysimeters, the leachate concentration was approximately 2.7 times greater in \nthose receiving the high dose compared with the low dose, which is close in value to the 2.5 \nratio in applied TCA dose; for the forest lysimeters the output concentration ratio was \napproximately two, i.e. slightly more applied TCA was degraded in high-dosed forest \nlysimeters than in low-dosed forest lysimeters (average TCA output\/input ratios of 0.26 (n = 4, \nlysimeter nos. 12, 16-18) and 0.34 (n = 3,  nos. 13-15), respectively).  \n \n 10 \nThe concentration of TCA in leachate from dosed agricultural soil lysimeters was 4-5 times \ngreater than that from dosed forest soil lysimeters (Table 2). This concentration disparity is \nconsistent with the 4-5 times smaller hydrological flux through the agricultural soil lysimeters \ndue to both the lower rainfall input and the greater evapotranspiration for these lysimeters. The \nmuch shorter flush-through time for the forest lysimeters must be balanced by a greater rate of \nTCA destruction activity in these organic-rich soil matrices in order to give the observed \nsituation overall that for both soil types approximately 30% of applied TCA passed through in \nleachate and 70% was degraded.   \n \nTable 2 and Figures 1 and S2 show that the response of the lysimeters to changes in applied \nTCA occurred within the two week timescale between dosing and leachate collection. Once \nTCA dosing ceased (in lysimeters A & B), there was return of leachate TCA concentration to \ncontrol lysimeter leachate concentration levels. The ratio of cumulative TCA output\/input for \nindividual lysimeters also remained fairly constant with time (gradients of lines in Figures 1 \nand S2) both during and after dosing. This confirms that TCA drainage and degradation \nprocesses act on timescales of just a few days and is shorter for the forest soil than for the \nagricultural soil. \n \nProcesses of TCA production and degradation \nIs this chemical transformation of TCA biotic or abiotic? In the experiments with -irradiated \n(\u201csterile\u201d) forest soil cores, a highly significantly greater proportion of applied TCA was \nrecovered in the leachate than from untreated control soil cores (Figure 2). Recovery exceeded \n90% for sterilized larch soil cores. This strongly implicates biotic processes mediating the \npermanent loss of TCA. Similarly, observation that \n14\nCO2 is released from the soils dosed with \n1,2-\n14\nC labelled TCA (Figure 3) implicates biological processes causing mineralisation of \nTCA. The areas under the curves in Figure 3 equate to 73-80% of the applied labelled TCA \nbeing lost by mineralisation to CO2. These values are entirely consistent with the average \nproportion of ~70% for non-retained (i.e. \u201clost\u201d) TCA inferred from the TCA-dosed in situ \nfield lysimeters (Table 1, and discussion above). The time profiles of radioactive CO2 release \nin Figure 3 also confirm that soil degradation of TCA operates on a time scale of tens of hours \nto day.  \n \nThe permanent mineralisation of TCA applied in these radioactivity experiments and to the in \nsitu soil lysimeters is likewise consistent with observations of permanent loss of TCA applied \n 11 \nto the soil surrounding Sitka spruce seedlings (Heal et al., 2003a; Dickey et al., 2004). \nBiological dehalogenation of TCA (and other haloacetic acids) at environmental \nconcentrations has been reported previously (Ellis et al., 2001; McRae et al., 2004), and the \nubiquity of microorganisms containing dehalogenation enzymes has been demonstrated using \ngene sequencing on samples taken throughout water treatment processes (Leach et al., 2009).  \n \nWhat about in situ production of TCA in soil? The soil cores made TCA-free showed \nproduction of TCA from only 24 h after rewetting at room temperature (Figure 4). The amount \nof TCA generated was not dependent on rewetting with water or with NaCl solution, but was \nsignificantly different between soils from different locations, with soil from within the Sitka \nspruce forest yielding significantly greater TCA than soil from within the larch forest or \nmoorland soil. It is not possible to conclude from this experiment the extent to which the \nproduction of the TCA is biotic, through stimulation of soil biomass, or abiotic, via processes \nsuch as those proposed by Fahimi et al. (2003). (The latter involves Fenton-type redox cycling \nwith Fe\n2+\n\/peroxide coupled to oxidation of chloride and chlorination of methoxy-type organic \nfunctional groups.) However, the strong correlation between soil TCA and measured soil \nmicrobial biomass C concentration (Figure 5) indirectly suggests that biologically-mediated \nprocesses dominate. Figure 5 shows that the organic-rich peaty horizons of the forest and \nmoorland soils are associated with both greater microbial biomass and TCA content, \nconsistent with the greater TCA-related activity for these soils inferred from the other \nexperiments. These observations are also consistent with recent process-based studies using \n36\nCl radioactively-labelled NaCl which have directly demonstrated TCA formation from \nlaboratory experiments with mixtures of humic or acetic acids and chloroperoxidase enzyme \nand with forest soils (Matucha et al., 2003b; Matucha et al., 2007). Figure 4 also shows that \nalthough TCA production is rapid, the soil cores move to a steady state in TCA concentration, \nsuch that TCA degradation and TCA production must operate simultaneously. This is also the \nconclusion from the radioactive tracer experiments (Matucha et al., 2003b; Matucha et al., \n2007).  \n \nImplications for TCA cycling in the environment \nThe overall picture that emerges from our in situ catchment and lysimeter studies, and work \nfrom other groups, is that the soil and forest environment is not passive with respect to TCA. \nWe have previously shown that a coniferous forest moderates TCA fluxes via the canopy \n(Stidson et al., 2004b) and hydrological pathways (Stidson et al., 2004a). Soil TCA activity \n 12 \ninferred from catchment scale measurements has been supported by the detailed soil-focused \nstudies presented here. We have shown that the soil has the facility both to generate and \ndegrade TCA on the timescale of a few days and that this is particularly the case for highly \norganic and biomass-C-rich forest soils. The available evidence is consistent with in situ \nbiologically-mediated processes being predominant for both the production and destruction \nprocesses operating simultaneously, although contribution from geochemical (abiotic) \nprocesses is not excluded. The soil processes relating to TCA as one example of a chlorinated \ncompound are likely only one component in the larger picture emerging of microbially-\nmediated chlorination and subsequent degradation of soil organic matter (Laturnus et al., \n2005; Clarke et al., 2009; Rohlenova et al., 2009).  \n \nAcknowledgments \nMuch of this work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council under grant \nNER\/A\/S\/1999\/00055 and studentship funding to CAD.
