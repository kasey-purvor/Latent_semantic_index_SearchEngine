It sets in context the\nresearch reported in this section in the papers by Cockrill et al. and Caven-Atack.\nFE has been in a state of transition for almost twenty years. Major changes have taken\nplace which have affected its status, funding, partnerships and its 'customer base'. But it\nhas always remained integral to local communities in providing a wide range of educa-\ntional opportunities. Information and Learning Technology (ILT) has played a part in\nsupporting teaching and learning in FE but, until recently, has rarely been part of any well-\ndeveloped strategy. This positional paper provides an overview of FE during recent years of\ntransition and change and describes the important new government investment that is sup-\nporting the development of a network infrastructure and a range of supporting activities to\nenable widespread use of ILT across FE for teaching, learning and management.\nBackground\nIn 1992 the Further and Higher Education Act created the English further education\nsector by taking colleges out of LEA control and bringing into existence the Further\nEducation Funding Council (FEFC). As in higher education (HE), similar funding\narrangements exist for further education in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn 1998-9 the FEFC allocated \u00a33.09 billion to a total of 437 colleges, 52 higher education\ninstitutions (HEIs) and 230 adult education centres. The majority of this funding was\nallocated to FE sector colleges ranging from small sixth-form colleges to large urban multi-\nsite general FE colleges. They include specialist colleges of agriculture or art and design\n5\nJoyce Martin et al Further education in transition\nand a small number of residential colleges for adults. Radical changes to the management\nof further education, increasing links between the sector and work-based learning, are\nplanned for April 2001 with the launch of the Learning and Skills Council.\nBoth the Kennedy (1997) and Fryer (1997) reports, as well as the more recent White Paper,\nLearning to Succeed (DfEE, 1999) have recognized the important role of further education\nin building the new culture of lifelong learning. Significant changes resulting from these\ndevelopments have already taken place. For example, the sector has delivered a 15 per cent\nrise in the number of funded full-time equivalent students and a 13 per cent efficiency gain\nin the last four years (FEFC, 1999a). However, public perception of FE is inevitably\ncoloured by personal experience of FE provision, which may range across many different\nlevels and subjects. A wide span of provision is one of the sector's key strengths but also a\nweakness since it can make the sector difficult to understand.\nInformation and learning technologies in further education\nThe Labour government's focus of lifelong learning has meant that FE is in the spotlight as\nnever before, with the challenge of widening participation and raising standards at the\nsame time. The Chief Inspector's Annual Report on FE (1998-9) notes:\nAn increasing number of colleges are also committed to the development of 'inclusive\nlearning'. This ensures that meeting the needs of individual students is paramount and\nthat there is coherence in the design of learning programmes, teaching and support\nactivities. The most successful colleges are able to use such strategies to raise levels of\nachievement while, at the same time, widening participation in further education by\nattracting under-represented groups within their community.\nIn further education, therefore, as in other sectors, there is a drive to raise standards, widen\nparticipation and improve the skills of the workforce in accordance with government\nobjectives. Many colleges make use of information and learning technologies (ILT) to\nunderpin these targets, though the use of technology to support learning is far from\nuniversal. It has not always been included in college development planning and has rarely\nbeen part of a strategy to help develop independent learning. There are frequently less than\nideal learning environments to accommodate changes in teaching and learning. Tutors may\nalso lack skills, confidence and competence in the use of ILT, and technical support is not\nalways strong.\nMany colleges have made the strategic decision to deliver significant parts of course\nprogrammes using intranet and Internet technologies. A recent study (Becta, 1999) found\nthat two of the main uses of ILT are to provide easy access for students to learning\nresources on intranets and to aid student retention and achievement by providing for\nindividualized learning styles. Remote access to materials and online course delivery are\nparticularly valuable for part-time students, adult returners and the growing number of\nworkplace-based students in SMEs. However, creating a potentially rich resource bank can\noften be beyond the means of a single institution. Collaborative developments among\ncollege consortia such as the FE National Consortium (FENC) and the Language\nDevelopment Network (LDN) have provided an important response to staff needs.\nHowever, despite these exemplars of good practice and collaborative activities, the use of\nILT to support teaching and learning has tended to remain the province of the individual\nenthusiast and a modest number of the more innovative and far-sighted colleges.\n6\nA\/t-J Volume 8 Number 3\nThe ILT survey (ibid., 1999) of colleges undertaken by Becta on behalf of the FE Funding\nCouncil revealed some interesting statistics. While the median ratio of full-time equivalent\nstudents to computers was approximately 8:1, this figure masked huge variation. While\none-fifth of colleges provided better than one computer for five FTE (full-time equivalent)\nstudents, at 3 per cent of colleges, sixteen or more FTEs shared every machine.\nFurthermore, the corresponding median figure for Internet-connected computers was in\nexcess of 20:1. Staff\/PC ratios were typically rather better at 6:1.\nThe National Learning Network\nIn its first comprehensive spending review, the government recognized the urgent need to\ngive additional support to the sector to ensure that all colleges are properly equipped for\nthe computer age. In 1998, \u00a374 million of government funding was allocated over three\nyears for IT infrastructure development in FE. In addition to the estimated college current\nannual IT spend of \u00a3100 million, this is the largest investment made by any government for\nIT-related activities within FE. The FEFC's ILT committee of college principals and sector\nexperts (known within the sector as the FE ILT committee) has carried out strategic\nplanning for the investment. The committee produced an ILT development strategy for the\nsector entitled Networking Lifelong Learning, endorsed by the FEFC in June 1999. Two\nimplementation task groups on 'Infrastructure' and 'Support' have consulted across the\nsector and produced implementation proposals. The resulting report, the FEFC's ILT\nImplementation Plan (FEFC, 1999b; FEFC, 1999c) provides a comprehensive strategy\nwhich aims to deliver effective integration of ILT into FE learning and teaching.\nDealing with the needs of more than 420 colleges and approximately four million students,\nthe aims of the FE ILT committee's strategy are ambitious. It is intended that ILT will be\nexploited to:\n\u2022 enrich the learning experiences of students;\n\u2022 improve teaching methods and standards;\nD facilitate better management practices; and\nD assist in the development of a more IT-literate society.\nThe FE ILT committee has not worked in isolation: new partnerships have been formed to\nhelp realize these plans. The FEFC has become the fifth funding partner of the JISC (Joint\nInformation Systems Committee) and now has sector representation on all JISC\ncommittees. In future, all JISC support services and programmes will consider the needs of\nfurther education, and a small number of additional staff are being recruited by the JISC\nwith experience of further education.\nKey FE sector organizations, such as Becta, FEDA (Further Education Development\nAgency) and NILTA (National Information and Learning Technology Association) are\nalso working together to help establish the FE ILT committee's blueprint.\nLocal and national strategic planning\nAs noted above, there have been relatively few examples of colleges explicitly building ILT\ninto their strategic planning for teaching and learning. The National Learning Network\n(NLN) initiative requires colleges to revisit their strategic planning to address this issue.\n7\nJoyce Martin et al Further education in transition\nColleges are required to develop and submit for checking an ILT strategy document.\nSupport for this activity in the form of guidelines and examples of good practice have been\nprovided, but it has been made clear that for colleges to qualify for future funding a sound\nILT strategy must have been submitted. Plans need to indicate the areas in which colleges\nare using the additional funding to supplement their own normal spending on information\nand learning technology.\nAs Figure 1 indicates, an analysis of ten current government-funded ICT initiatives (DfEE,\n1998) suggests that their focus is predominantly on hardware and connectivity. Nearly\nfour-fifths of the total funding (some \u00a31.6 billion) is devoted to infrastructure acquisition.\nHowever, the general lessons of previous IT investment suggest that for change to take\nroot, a significant portion of the available funding has to be allocated to the 'softer' aspects\nof innovation - specifically, content development and staff training in continuing\nprofessional development (CPD). The FE ILT committee's planning has taken note of\nthese lessons and attempts to address the need for investments in both learning materials\nand staff development.\nContent B j B\n,.

The Secretary of State for Education, David Blunkett, used the phrase\n'National Learning Network' to describe this infrastructure, which will include higher\neducation with links to the University for Industry (Ufl), National Grid for Learning\n(NGfL), museums, libraries and other networks.\nRather than create a separate electronic network for FE colleges, the FEFC has elected,\nthrough its membership of the JISC, to base its developments on the existing JANET\nnetwork. UKERNA is managing the connections and each college will have a minimum\nbandwidth of 2 Mb per second delivered to its door by spring 2001. Nine recently\nestablished regional support centres (RSCs) will provide technical support, training and\nawareness to colleges. Funding was made available in the first year of the initiative to\n8\nAlt-] Volume 8 Number 3\nprovide vendor-specific training for technicians in colleges, to improve local area networks\nand to facilitate the purchase of equipment for designated ILT 'champions'. In later years,\nfurther funding will go directly to colleges to enable equipment update arid to facilitate the\nlicensing of managed learning environments (see below).\nStaff development\nOver the past four years there has been a drive to improve staff awareness of the potential\nof ILT and to assist colleges in their use of ILT. Many colleges, through initiatives such as\nthe Quality in Information and Learning Technology (QUILT) staff development\nprogramme and European-funded ADAPT projects, have been involved in innovative\ndevelopments using ILT to support teaching and learning. Some examples of college good\npractice in ILT include work done at Telford College of Arts and Technology, winner of\nBecta's 1998 Beacon Award, initiatives at Wirral Metropolitan College, with its 'Learning\nWeb', and at Gateshead College, with its development of specialist courses for the deaf\ntaught by deaf tutors through the use of video conferencing.\nA substantial training programme to develop 'ILT champions' at both managerial and\ncurriculum level has been devised by Becta and was delivered throughout summer 2000.\nFunding given direct to colleges will be used to free up time for their 'champions' to\ncascade their newly acquired knowledge to colleagues. Manager-level champions, on the\nother hand, will be well placed to assist their college in implementing its ILT strategy.\nAn important aspect of the broader staff development programme under the NLN is the\nplan to provide a set of ILT modules mapped against the FENTO (Further Education\nNational Training Organization) standards framework, to give staff appropriate de-\nscriptors for goals within programmes of continuing professional development. This is\nnecessarily a longer-term intention because of the involvement of the NTO and awarding\nbodies throughout the UK, but indicates the depth of thinking that the NLN initiative has\npromoted. Complementing this programme \u00a35.45 million from the Standards Fund has\nbeen allocated to colleges for ILT staff development.\nLearning materials exploitation\nQuite apart from new materials under development for the Ufl, some electronic learning\nmaterials already exist for use in colleges but the quality is extremely variable; many have\nlittle pedagogic foundation and offer little or no interaction for the student. The\nnetworking of colleges, however, opens up new opportunities for the development of\nonline learning materials that can be accessed by large numbers of students and staff.\nSubstantial funding has therefore been allocated under the NLN to commission a range of\nnew high-quality ILT materials, which will be made available free or virtually free at point\nof use throughout FE. The selection of the materials to be developed has followed detailed\nmapping and auditing of existing college materials use by FEDA. The design of a suitable\n'repository' for newly created materials is also under consideration following an NLN\nfeasibility study conducted by NILTA.\nMany colleges have a programme of 'in-house' ILT materials development, but given the\nrelatively small numbers of students undertaking each college course and the considerable\ninvestment required to produce high-quality learning resources, many find the exercise too\ncostly and time-consuming. The FE ILT committee, however, considered it essential that\n9\nJoyce Martin et al Further education in transition\nan element of the learning materials development funding be devolved directly to colleges.\nThe expectation, based in part on the experience of the earlier QUILT programme, is that\nthis funding will help increase the ability of staff to make fluent use of new and emerging\ntechnologies and to create or adapt learning resources for diverse groups of learners.\nWithout the development of these skills, the opportunity to widen participation, enrich\nstudents' learning experience and equip them for the new technology age will be lost.\nIn parallel with the materials exploitation, through its subcommittee on integrated\nenvironments for learners (JCIEL), the JISC and other NLN partners are working on a\ndetailed specification for the developer community of managed learning environments\n(MLEs) both in terms of functionality and standards for interoperability. The issue of\nstandards is integral to all NLN development activities and all new learning materials will\nbe produced to open standards to enable portability, accessibility and transferability. Close\nwork with the Ufl has taken place to secure the 'fit' between NLN and Ufl materials.\nAn evaluation strategy to measure the success of the National Learning Network has\nalready been established and set in motion by the DfEE. As well as evaluating the\neffectiveness of the individual projects, more than forty colleges are taking part in a\nprogramme to measure the impact of the initiative, the new connectivity and the way that\ncolleges use ILT in their teaching and learning.\nConclusion: looking forward\nNo development in ICT is without its attendant issues, and no one expects the NLN\ninitiative to be without problems. Whilst the programmes of staff development have been\ncreated and a measure of funding secured to enable college staff to participate in them, so\nfar the scale of the funding is insufficient to the task. It does not begin to approach the\n\u00a3400 per head allocated for the training of school teachers and librarians under the New\nOpportunities Fund's programmes in support of the National Grid for Learning and the\nPeople's Network.\nEqually, the amount of funding for the development of new ILT learning materials falls far\nshort of the scale of the HE Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP), and\nat current prices will purchase only a few hundred hours of course time. Finally, IT\nequipment and networks require recurrent investment - 'one-off' funding is not a long-\nterm solution to their acquisition. However, the scale of the funding that has been made\navailable to FE under the first round of the comprehensive spending review certainly\nreflects a genuine intention on the part of government to move forward with the provision\nof online learning. As such, the funding has proved to be a tremendous morale boost to\nthose colleagues who have - through their vision and energy - sought:\nD to create wholesale change in the sector's learning offering;\n\u2022 to confront the need for flexibility and custom-responsiveness; and\nD to play a key role in addressing the UK's skills deficiencies.\nThus the National Learning Network, while still in its infancy, is helping to change the face\nof vocational education and training in England and to lend its weight to drive forward\nchange, opening up new options for lifelong learners nationally.\n10\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nReferences\nBritish Educational Communications and Technology Agency (1999), Learning On-Line:\nElectronic Learning Resources in Further Education, Coventry: Becta.\nDepartment for Education and Employment (1998), Open for Learning, Open for Business,\nLondon: DfEE.\nDepartment for Education and Employment (1999), Learning to Succeed: A New\nFramework for Post-16 Learning, London: Stationery Office.\nFryer, R.
