This \nincreasing salience of spirituality raises important questions about the boundaries of good \nprofessional practice. Answers to these questions require not only careful attention to defining and \nunderstanding the nature of spirituality, but also closer attention to the nature of concepts of \nsecularity and self than psychiatry has usually given. Far from being \u201cneutral ground\u201d, secularity is \ninherently biased against concepts of transcendence. Our secular age is preoccupied with a form of \nimmanence that emphasises interiority, autonomy and reason, but this preoccupation has \nparadoxically been associated with an explosion of interest in the transcendent in new, often non-\nreligious and non-traditional forms. This context, as well as the increasing evidence base for spiritual \nand religious coping as important ways of dealing with mental stress and mental disorder, requires \nthat psychiatry give more careful attention to the ways in which people find meaning in spirituality \nand religion. This in turn requires that more clinical attention be routinely given to spiritual history \ntaking and the incorporation of spiritual considerations in treatment planning. \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nSpirituality and religion are now topics of major interest within the healthcare arena, and mental \nhealth is no exception. The 2001 Handbook of Religion and Health (H. G. Koenig, McCullough, & \nLarson, 2001) reviewed 1200 studies on the interaction between religion and health, and research \nhas continued to expand since then (C. C. H. Cook, 2004). The aim of Mental Health, Religion and \nCulture, expressed within the front cover of each issue, is to provide \u201ca forum and a single point of \nreference for the growing number of professionals and academics working in the expanding field of \nmental health and religion\u201d. The American Psychological Association has a series of publications \nwhich provide guidance on the integration of spirituality and religion into psychological assessments \nand treatments (Aten & Leach, 2009; Miller, 2000; Richards & Bergin, 2000) and a recent major work \non religion and psychiatry has been published by the World Psychiatric Association (Verhagen, Praag, \nL\u00f3pez-Ibor, Cox, & Moussaoui, 2010). In the UK, as elsewhere, mental health service users and other \npatients have expressed concern that they would like to be able to discuss spiritual matters with \ntheir doctor\/psychiatrist (McCord, et al., 2004; Mental Health Foundation, 2002). As discussed by \none of us in a paper in this issue of Mental Health, Religion and Culture, spirituality and religion are \ncurrently topics of some controversy and interest amongst psychiatrists in the UK, and the \nSpirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (SPSIG) \nprovides one arena within which this debate is flourishing. \n \nSpirituality in Psychiatry: The Current Debate \nThe recent UK controversy seems to have been sparked off by an editorial by Harold Koenig in \nPsychiatric Bulletin in 2008 (Harold G. Koenig, 2008). Koenig proposed that good psychiatric practice \nshould include the taking of a spiritual history, the support of healthy religious beliefs and the \nchallenging of unhealthy ones, in \u201chighly selected cases\u201d praying with patients, and close working \nwith trained clergy. This editorial generated a vigorous correspondence, including a letter from Rob \nPoole and his colleagues (Poole, et al., 2008), and a subsequent special article by way of response \nfrom the SPSIG (Dein, Cook, Powell, & Eagger, 2010). In brief, the expressed concerns have been that \nKoenig\u2019s proposals in various ways breach proper professional boundaries, that they lack respect for \nthose who reject transcendence, that they open the door to proselytising, and that they risk causing \nharm (for example to patients with religious delusions). The matter of praying with patients, even \nthough this was something that Koenig himself expressed great caution about, seemed to provide a \nparticular focus for concern. \nPapers in this special section of Mental Health Religion and Culture make important contributions to \nthe ongoing debate. Rob Poole and Robert Higgo are concerned at what they perceive as \u201cserious \nbreaches of normal professional boundaries\u201d and wish to resist a move towards routine spiritual \nassessment. They are unhappy with the possibility of patients and professionals praying together, \nthey perceive spirituality as a culture bound concept, lacking in neutrality, and they feel that the \nSPSIG has exceeded its remit when it adopts what they understand to be a \u201ccampaigning role\u201d. \nSecularity, on the other hand, they see as being neutral ground within which science and faith are \nalike protected. David Crossley, in contrast, draws attention to the way in which the boundaries of \nthe self and the nature of secularity are not well defined in the contemporary debate on the place of \n4 \n \nspirituality within psychiatry. How is it possible that psychiatry as a secular discipline engaged in \nworking with and for those who suffer from mental disorder is not clear either about what \nconstitutes secularity or about what the nature and boundaries of the human \u201cself\u201d are? Given this \nuncertainty, how can we know what the boundaries of secular psychiatry are in relation to the \nautonomous and integrated self? \nPoole, Higgo and Crossley between them raise some important questions, and it is clear especially \nfrom Crossley\u2019s paper that we will not be likely to find all of the answers from within our own \nprofessional boundaries. In contrast to theology, philosophy and anthropology, psychiatry has given \nrelatively little attention to what constitutes the \u201cself\u201d and, although it is often presumed that \npsychiatry is a secular endeavour, it is also rare to hear debate within the profession about exactly \nwhat secularity is. Even if these concepts were more regularly debated amongst psychiatrists (and it \nis encouraging to see that they are now becoming a topic for debate) it would be arrogant and out of \nkeeping with the multi-disciplinary tradition of psychiatry to imagine that helpful answers cannot be \nfound outside the boundaries of the profession. \n \nSecularity and Self \nWhat, then, is \u201csecularity\u201d and what is the \u201cself\u201d? Charles Taylor, cited by Crossley, has argued that \nsecularity may mean different things, including a falling away of belief in religion and the \nunderstanding of belief as just one option amongst others (Taylor, 2007, pp. 1-3). However, although \nthese meanings may often be implied and assumed in psychiatric practice, the general sense in \nwhich Crossley suggests that we understand psychiatry as secular is undoubtedly correct. Psychiatry, \nas a profession, is understood as separate from matters of belief and can be conducted without \nreference to theology, doctrine or notions of transcendence. Or can it? The problem is that \npsychiatry is intimately concerned with what patients believe and it has undoubtedly shown a \npropensity in the past to label religious beliefs as pathological. That religious beliefs are now more \nrespected within psychiatry, and that they may be seen as helpful and adaptive rather than \nnecessarily pathological, is a tribute to the extent to which the profession has become more willing \nto engage with and understand the diversity of spiritual and religious beliefs and practices that are \nencountered amongst healthy and flourishing people in the world today. In other words, whether \nthese beliefs are falling away or not (and it is not at all clear in most parts of the world that they are), \nthey are still very much a part of the human landscape that psychiatrists need to reckon with. \nHowever, Taylor\u2019s analysis has more to contribute to our present debate. Taylor argues that our \ncurrent secular age is characterised by \u201cclosed world structures\u201d which make transcendence appear \nto be much less of a live option than it really is. The power of these structures is that they are not \nrecognised for what they are. It is in this way that they restrict our grasp of reality and, in particular, \nrestrict our grasp of the transcendent. One of the ways in which this happens, Taylor argues, is by \nthe prioritisation of the knowing self, such that anything that is not immanent is suspect (Taylor, \n2007, pp. 557-558). It is this that simultaneously privileges scientific knowledge and makes secularity \nappear to be \u201cneutral\u201d ground when in fact it is not. It is deeply biased against the transcendent. \n5 \n \nTaylor\u2019s analysis of the self is also revealing (Taylor, 1989). The deep sense of inwardness, and the \nradically self-reflexive stance, that is adopted in contemporary understandings of the self has its \norigins in Christianity but is now also strongly informed by Romanticism (leading to a sense of good \ninner resources which must be tapped) and an emphasis on everyday life as the arena within which \nself-identify is formed and becomes known. This has important implications for psychotherapy, and \nit is therefore not surprising that many therapists have incorporated notions of spirituality (both as \nimmanent inner resource and as transcendent reality) within their practice. \nTaylor\u2019s analysis, which is a searching and complex treatise, only the surface of which has been \nscratched here, has important implications for psychiatry. In particular, attempts to close down the \ntranscendent option, or to argue that psychiatry has nothing to do with spirituality, are more likely \nto be the result of the operation of hidden closed world structures which distort the appearance of \nreality than they are to be protective mechanisms which preserve healthy professional or ethical \nboundaries or defend personal religious belief. \nSpirituality \nTaylor\u2019s work also deals with what he refers to as the \u201cnova effect\u201d, which presents us (at least in \nthe western world) with an \u201cever widening variety of moral\/spiritual options\u201d(Taylor, 2007, p. 299). \nIt is in this context, not the context of traditional religion, that spirituality has become an important \ntopic. It is important not just for psychiatric practice, but for a proper philosophical account of the \nself-understanding of all human beings in our secular age. This is not to say that all human beings \nwill self-identify as \u201cspiritual\u201d, but that the spiritual and moral options presented to us (including the \noption to self identify as \u201cnot spiritual\u201d) are more numerous and diverse than ever before. Just as \nthe option to self identify as \u201cnon-political\u201d is a political statement, and does not refute the \nexistence of politics as an important concern of the human social order, so the option to be \u201cnon-\nspiritual\u201d is a spiritual self-statement which does not in any way undermine the value of spirituality \nas an important concept, descriptive of an important aspect of human self-understanding. \nPace Poole and Higgo, spirituality is not a \u201cdoctrine\u201d or a theology. It does not require belief in God \nand it does not presume any particular set of teachings or beliefs. Neither does it imply any kind of \necumenism or syncretism or perennial philosophy. It is a way of talking about such things as \ntranscendence and immanence, relationship, meaning and purpose which are peculiarly human (C. \nC. H. Cook, 2004). Undoubtedly there are those who feel that it is a concept without merit, or that it \nhas no integrity or validity. However, to deny the use of the word\/concept would still leave issues \nsuch as transcendence and immanence as important topics of discourse for human self-\nunderstanding and other words and concepts would still be needed in order to have the same kind \nof conversation. Spirituality has emerged as a way of talking about such things because it does not \nrequire either doctrine or theology. For many people it will be inseparable from religion, but for \nothers it is antithetical to religion. Discussion about spirituality does not require that one adhere to, \nor deny, any particular religious tradition, or belief system or worldview. In this sense, it is a \ncompletely neutral concept which provides common ground for discourse about important aspects \nof human self-understanding which would otherwise not easily be possible in our secular age. \n \n6 \n \nBoundaries \nWhat then should be the boundaries of conversation about spirituality within psychiatry? \nBoundaries may be professional, therapeutic or ethical. These will overlap and may conflict to \nvarying degrees, posing dilemmas for the psychiatrist. What if the psychiatrist feels it is outside \nhis\/her professional competence as a psychiatrist to discuss particular spiritual issues with the \npatient, but that it is nevertheless therapeutically important that for a particular patient such issues \nshould be addressed? What if it is felt to be spiritually beneficial for a patient to explore a particular \nspiritual tradition to which the psychiatrist subscribes, yet no advice or support for doing so must be \noffered in case it would be taken as proselytising and therefore would breach an important \nprofessional ethical boundary? These kinds of boundary issues are not unusual in psychiatry, and \nwould be more easily managed if a set of guidelines existed for psychiatrists in the UK similar to that \nadopted by the American Psychiatric Association (Committee on Religion and Psychiatry, 1990). \nThe guidance that the GMC provide to all doctors registered for practice in the UK includes, as Poole \nand Higgo point out, safeguards that prohibit doctors from sharing their beliefs with patients in such \na way as to exploit vulnerability, or cause distress, and also an injunction against putting pressure on \npatients to \u201cdiscuss or justify their beliefs\u201d. These are specific applications of general principles of \ngood professional practice. It is never acceptable to exploit the vulnerability of patients. Nor is it \nacceptable to cause them avoidable distress, or to put pressure on them to discuss or justify \nanything that they do not wish to. However, all doctors have been faced with the situation at some \ntime or another where their duty of care requires that they impart distressing information, or that \nthey broach subjects which patients would rather not discuss. In the practice of psychiatry such \ntensions can arise in many aspect of personal history taking or mental state examination, including \ndiscussion about intimate relationships, enquiry into forensic history, exploration of delusional \nbeliefs, or feelings of guilt. In a similar way, spiritual and religious concerns may easily be avoided \nwhen it may be therapeutically important that they be discussed. This is implicitly acknowledged, \nalthough not explored in detail, in GMC guidance to doctors which states that: \nFor some patients, acknowledging their beliefs, or religious practices may be an important \naspect of a holistic approach to their care. Discussing personal beliefs may, when \napproached sensitively, help you to work in partnership with patients to address their \nparticular needs. You must respect patients\u2019 right to hold religious or other beliefs and \nshould take those beliefs into account where they may be relevant to treatment options. \nHowever, if patients do not wish to discuss their personal beliefs with you, you must respect \ntheir wishes. (General Medical Council, 2008)  \n \nSPSIG \nThe SPSIG has not been prescriptive in its approach and has not thus far adopted any position with \nregard to guidelines on good practice, although the possibility that such guidance might be explored \nin future is not excluded. If it has \u201ccampaigned\u201d at all, then it has campaigned for better education of \npsychiatrists about spirituality, for wider awareness of the need to consider spirituality and religion \nin psychiatric assessment and treatment, and for more openness to talking about these topics both \n7 \n \nwithin and with those outside the profession. It has not promoted discussion of such matters with \npatients who \u201cresist\u201d such discussion, it has not promoted praying with patients, and it is opposed to \nproselytising amongst patients in any form. \nThe SPSIG does exist to promote discussion amongst professionals, such as the discussion that is \ntaking place within the pages of this issue of Mental Health, Religion and Culture. Members of the \nSPSIG have diverse views on the matters that are being debated here, and very possibly some will \nagree with the views expressed by Poole and Higgo, whilst others will equally strongly disagree. In \nthe preface to Spirituality and Psychiatry, a book which was conceived by the SPSIG and published by \nRCPsych Press, it was stated by the editors that they expected the book to be provocative, but that \nthere was no expectation that everyone could or should agree with the views expressed by authors \nwithin it (C. Cook, Powell, & Sims, 2009, p. xiv). As with all special interest groups within the Royal \nCollege of Psychiatrists, views expressed do not represent a position taken by the College unless \nformally approved and published as such. \nA good account of what the SPSIG has campaigned for (if it is to be called \u201ccampaigning\u201d) is in fact \nwell stated by Poole and Higgo: \nPsychiatry is a profession that depends on a detailed and sophisticated understanding of \npatients\u2019 lives. Little can be understood about mental distress without a good grasp of social \nand psychological context (Poole & Higgo, 2006). Psychopathology is assessed \npredominately by use of methods borrowed from phenomenology, a technique that rests on \nempathy and an understanding of the individual\u2019s internal experience. Religion and \nspirituality are important ways in which many people organise their understanding of the \nworld. They form a configuration of ideology, ritual and social practice that profoundly affect \nthe way that lives are led and experienced. All psychiatrists have to be able to understand \nreligion and spirituality, together with many other aspects of lives and cultures that may be \nvery different from their own. These are empathic skills that are essential to the reliable \napplication of our science. They are not optional, nor do they depend on our own personal \nattitudes to matters of faith. \n \nWhy the Controversy? \nGiven this clear measure of agreement on what is important, it is still unclear why Koenig\u2019s 2008 \neditorial in Psychiatric Bulletin generated quite so much controversy. It is also unclear why Poole and \nHiggo interpret the SPSIG campaign (sic) as proposing \u201cserious breaches of normal professional \nboundaries of behaviour\u201d. In another paper in this issue, one of us has suggested four possible \nreasons why spirituality and religion might have the potential to cause a heated response: \na) There is a transatlantic cultural difference which makes the proposals of Koenig and others \nappear more controversial in the UK than they may be in the US \nb) There are misunderstandings about the differences between spirituality and religion \n8 \n \nc) The discussion of spiritual or religious matters with patients might be found by clinicians to \nbe personally challenging or threatening in some way, perhaps because it is seen as \ntransgressing professional boundaries \nd) The discussion of spiritual or religious matters with patients might be perceived as \npotentially harmful \nPoole and Higgo, in their article in this issue of Mental Health, Religion and Culture, do not appear to \nacknowledge the first or second of these possible reasons, but they do clearly agree with the third \nand the fourth, those relating to boundaries and harm. We do not feel that a reasoned discussion \nabout the nature of the professional boundaries involved should be a cause for concern, and some \nof the important differences between different kinds of boundaries have already been discussed, \nabove. It is possible of course that other boundaries are important here \u2013 such as the boundaries of \nwhat Taylor refers to at the \u201cbuffered self\u201d, a self which is potentially threatened by discussion of \nspiritual and religious matters. This is another feature of secularity which would appear to render \nthe secular domain much less than neutral for discourse on the topic at hand. \nThe matter of the harm that may be caused by bringing spirituality or religion into the clinical \nconsultation is an important one and undoubtedly deserves much more research and study than it \nhas hitherto received. Poole and Higgo provide examples known to them of the ways in which prayer \ncan undermine a therapeutic relationship or worsen a patient\u2019s clinical condition, the complications \nthat can arise from an explicitly acknowledged shared faith perspective between doctor and patient, \nand the impairment of clinical judgment that can emerge when the justification for clinical \ninterventions is argued on religious rather than scientific grounds. We recognise and agree with \nthese concerns, and could add more examples of our own. Further evidence for concern, if such is \nneeded, is provided by Galanter\u2019s important study of the impact of evangelical belief on clinical \npractice in the US (Galanter, Larson, & Rubenstone, 1991). However, it is hardly surprising that \nexamples of poor practice may be found when there have been so few opportunities afforded by \nmedical training and continuing professional development within which to discuss good practice in \nthis domain. It is at least partly to remedy this deficiency that the SPSIG was founded. We do not feel \nthat a ban on all discussion of spirituality and religion within the consulting room would actually help \nat all. Rather, it would be likely to render the abuses of such privilege more deeply hidden whilst \nsimultaneously impeding the possible therapeutic benefits of good practice. \n \nSummary \nIn conclusion, it is suggested that secularity provides far from neutral ground when it comes to \nmanaging the good and bad influences of spirituality and religion on the clinical practice of \npsychiatry. This does not mean that psychiatry must be practised in a religious context, but it does \nmean that exploration of spiritual matters in the clinical context needs to be informed by better \nunderstandings of the hidden assumptions of the secular age in which we live and of the complex \nnature of the buffered self that this age has fostered. Such understanding is aided by the kinds of \nexchange that are to be found within the pages of this issue of Mental Health, Religion and Culture \nbut it also requires to be addressed within professional training and in continuing professional \n9 \n \ndevelopment. Groups such as SPSIG, whether perceived as \u201ccampaigning\u201d or not, have an important \npart to play in assisting this process. \n \nReferences \nAten, J. D., & Leach, M. M. (Eds.). (2009).
