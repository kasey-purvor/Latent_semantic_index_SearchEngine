We aim to cover the major\nachievements in this field, including results recently obtained in Ljubljana and\nLancaster.\nWe start by outlining the motivation, structure and content of the review. It\nhas long been known that cardiovascular signals contain a number of oscil-\nlatory components that are not exactly periodic. To put it differently, their\nperiods (frequencies) fluctuate with time. For example, heart rate variability\n(HRV) has in itself provided a major topic of discussion. We introduce one of\nthe statistical approaches to HRV in Sec. 3. However, in order to understand\nthe variability of the cardiovascular system, discussion of a single source is\ninsufficient because the cardiovascular system is composed of many different\nphysiological components (subsystems) and it is the effects of their mutual\ninteraction that combine to produce HRV. This is demonstrated in Sec. 4,\nrevealed by results obtained using the wavelet transform. In Sec. 5, we dis-\ncuss the cardio-respiratory interaction in terms of phase synchronization. To\nset the scene for these later discussions, we summarise the basic principles of\nphase dynamics in Sec. 2. For readers who are unfamiliar with the physiolog-\nical aspects of the research, we provide appendices A on the cardiovascular\nsystem and B on how measurements of cardiovascular signals are conducted.\nAppendix C provides details of the statistical methods used in the group data\nanalyses.\nBefore embarking on the central topics, however, we first summarise their\nhistorical background in order to set the review in context.\n1.1 Cardiovascular signals in context\nCardiovascular signals carry information that reflects ongoing processes that\nnormally occur unseen, within the interior of the body. They can be used\nto characterise the state of the system, including the diagnosis of incipient\npathophysiological conditions before symptoms become obvious. A well-known\nexample is the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, representing the electrical ac-\ntivity of the heart. ECG measurements have been used for diagnostic purposes\nfor almost a century. For the first several decades of such measurements, atten-\ntion was focussed mainly on the detailed shape of the approximately periodic\npulses seen in the signal. The physiological relationships that could be drawn\nfrom the data were restricted to static values because only chart recorders\nwere available.\n4\nWith the advent of computers, starting in the 1960s, it became possible to\nsample physiological variables in real time and to store data for analysis. The\nresultant time series (signals) immediately introduced a need for tools for\nstudying the dynamical properties of the underlying physiological processes.\nBecause of the complexity of the time series, the tools developed for spectral\nanalysis were applied mainly with the aim of filtering out the noise, thereby\nreducing the complexity. Various methods of linear filtering were introduced,\nas was also a fast algorithm for calculation of the Fourier transform (now\nwell known as the fast Fourier transform, or FFT). Application of the FFT\nto the most studied cardiovascular signal, the ECG, quickly showed that it\npossesses oscillatory components [1]. In their pioneering work Hyndman, Kit-\nney and Sayers [2] pointed to the generally oscillatory nature of physiological\ncontrol systems. These two studies initiated a large area of research into the\noscillatory nature of cardiovascular functions based on frequency and time-\nfrequency methods including FFT [3] parametric spectral estimation [4] and\nwavelet spectra [5\u20137].\nThe investigation of deterministic chaotic dynamics and, in particular, the in-\ntroduction of measures to quantify fractal dynamics triggered an avalanche of\nnew studies of cardiovascular dynamics. The pioneering algorithm by Grass-\nberger and Proccacia [8] motivated a large number of applications, and chaotic\nbehaviour was proposed as a possible scenario [9, 10]. Several methods based\non statistical physics were proposed. Scaling properties [11\u201315], multifractal\nproperties [16,17], and the 1\/f spectra [18\u201320] of heart rate variability (HRV),\nwere all discussed.\nThe approach based on coupled nonlinear oscillators was to some extent de-\nveloped separately. It was marked by two major milestones: introduction of\nthe concept of entrainment within an ensemble of oscillators by Winfree [21];\nand its analysis by Kuramoto [22] using a phase model. After Winfree had\ngone further into the theory of the geometry of biological time [23], Kuramoto\ngeneralized the phase dynamics approach [24] by reducing the degrees of free-\ndom of the original dynamical system. For this to work, the original dynamics\nshould be perturbed weakly by noise, by an external force, or by coupling to\ndynamics with a limit-cycle orbit. The latter describes dissipative systems and\nthe form of the phase dynamics is not dependent on the form of the original\nmodel. Numerous researchers contributed to the development of the theory,\nand the model was further generalized by Strogatz [25]. Because of its univer-\nsality and simplicity, phase dynamics can be applied quite generally to oscil-\nlatory phenomena in dissipative systems. It was this body of work that sub-\nsequently motivated the introduction of the theory of phase synchronization,\nfacilitating studies of the interactions between coupled nonlinear and chaotic\noscillators [26]. Coupled oscillators were proposed as a possible description of\nthe dynamics of the cardiovascular system [5] and synchronization between\ncardiac and respiratory oscillations, and their mutual modulation, were exam-\n5\nined with particular care [7,27\u201333]. The emerging picture motivated additional\nstudies, and several methods for analysis of the direction of coupling among\ninteracting oscillatory processes have recently been proposed [34\u201337].\nThe mystery of ageing has continued to intrigue, giving rise to studies in all\nareas of physiology. The relationship between HRV and ageing was soon appre-\nciated [38\u201340]. Goldberger and coworkers were the first to study the dynamics\nof cardiovascular ageing, using measures drawn from statistical physics to show\nthat the complexity of cardiovascular dynamics decreases with aging [41\u201344].\nFurthermore, randomness in the heartbeat time series [45], and loss of time\nirreversibility [46], were shown to occur with ageing. Ageing has also been\ncharacterized by a decrease in endothelial-related vasodilation [47, 48] and,\nvery recently, by an insufficiency of the sympathetic nervous system to cope\ndynamically with various environmental stimuli [49].\n1.2 Coupled nonlinear oscillators and the cardiovascular system\nCoupled oscillators have been investigated by many physicists, in part because\nthe emergence of synchronization has similarities to phase transition phenom-\nena, which had been studied earlier in many contexts. The synchronization\ntransition was analyzed by the application of mean field theory to globally-\ncoupled ensembles of oscillators, in which each oscillator is coupled to all the\nother oscillators equally under a sine coupling function (the Kuramoto model).\nThe stability of the macroscopic oscillation (synchronized solution) was ad-\ndressed by Croford and Strogatz [50], [51] and [52], and the coupled function\nwas extended by Sakaguchi [53]. Not only global coupling, but also local cou-\npling in which a given oscillator couples only to its nearest neighbors, and\nwhich is equivalent to the diffusion coupling in a continuous system, have been\nstudied extensively, e.g. in the form of the Ginzburg-Landau equation [24]. Ku-\nramoto also suggested another form of coupling, intermediate between local\nand global, known as nonlocal coupling [54, 55]. It has a finite coupling dis-\ntance so that an oscillator can interact, not only with its nearest neighbors,\nbut also with other nearby oscillators. It is more realistic than global coupling\nbecause a given oscillator cannot in reality interact with all the others because\nof the finite coupling distance. Compared to local and global coupling, which\nhave been studied widely, nonlocal coupling has not been studied very much to\ndate. But this model is expected to be useful because its coupling length is ad-\njustable to match reality. It is expected to encompass interesting phenomena\nthat are as yet undiscovered. Studies of nonlocal coupling include [56\u201360].\nIn the human cardiovascular system, there are many phenomena to which the\nconcept of entrainment, or synchronization, of coupled oscillators can be ap-\nplied. One of them is the emergence of macroscopic oscillations through the\n6\nentrainment of the individual microscopic oscillations of individual cells which,\nin the uncoupled state, would have slightly different frequencies. For example,\nit is well known that the heart has pacemaker cells to which other cells are\nentrained. It is also reported that the initiation of vasomotion requires the syn-\nchronization of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [61]. Entrainment\ncan also arise through the interaction of macroscopic oscillators of different\nphysiological origin. In the latter case, coupled oscillators were proposed as\na possible description of the dynamics of the cardiovascular system [5]: syn-\nchronization between cardiac and respiratory oscillations, and their mutual\nmodulation, have been examined with particular care [7,27\u201333]. The emerging\npicture motivated additional studies, and several methods have recently been\nproposed for analysis of the direction of coupling among interacting oscilla-\ntory processes [34\u201337]. Interactions between the cardiovascular oscillations and\nbrain waves have been also studied by using the concepts of coupled oscillators\nand directionality [62,63]. The notion of phase dynamics can be useful in terms\nnot only of phase synchronization but also of phase-resetting [21]. For exam-\nple, the annihilation of pacemaker activity in cardiac tissues was observed [64]\nvia phase-resetting. The authors used a current pulse to stimulate SA nodal\npacemaker cells (see A.3.2), and observed phase-resetting phenomena. If the\ntiming and amplitude were appropriate, the autonomous oscillatory activity\nstopped. Spiral waves during cardiac fibrillation can be terminated by shock-\ninduced phase-resetting [65]: such spiral waves, rotating around singularities\nin the heart, known as ventricular fibrillation, can lead to death because the\nheart cannot then pump the blood properly. The latter represents a successful\napplication of phase dynamics to clinical medicine.\n1.3 Time-invariant complexity analysis of heart rate variability (HRV)\nThe investigation of deterministic chaotic dynamics, and in particular the\nintroduction of measures to quantify the complexity of fractal dynamics, trig-\ngered an avalanche of new work, including cardiovascular studies. Hurst intro-\nduced what is now known as the Hurst exponent to quantify a scaling property\nwhen he investigated problems related to water storage in the Nile [66, 67].\nMandelbrot and Wallis examined and elaborated the method further [68\u201374].\nFeder gives an excellent overview of the history, theory and applications, and\nadds some more statistical experiments in [75]. Although estimation of the\nHurst exponent was originally developed in hydrology, modern techniques for\nestimating the Hurst exponent come from fractal mathematics. The mathe-\nmatics and images derived from fractal geometry exploded during the 1970s\nand 1980s. A fractal object is composed of sub-units and sub-sub-units on\nmultiple levels that resemble the structure of the whole object (self-similarity)\nand it has a fractional dimension. Chaotic dynamics is often associated with\na strange attractor that can be characterized by its fractal dimensionality\n7\nD [76]. This dimension of a chaotic system is one of the ways to measure\ncomplexity. The pioneering algorithm introduced by Grassberger and Proc-\ncacia enabled the \u2018strangeness\u2019 of an attractor to be calculated in an easier\nway [8] and motivated a large number of applications. Another method for\nthe measurement of complexity based on an entropy, was also proposed by\nGrassberger and Proccacia [77]. Ways to compute the approximate dimen-\nsion and approximate entropy were suggested by Kaplan et al [41]. Chaotic\nbehavior was proposed as a possible scenario [9, 10]. Several methods, based\non statistical physics were introduced. Scaling properties [11\u201315], multifractal\nproperties [16,17], and the 1\/f spectra [18\u201320] of heart rate variability (HRV),\nwere also discussed in considerable detail.\nOn the other hand, the heart rate is known to have characteristics that differ\nbetween healthy people and people with heart disease [44]. The heart rate of\nhealthy people is far from being a homeostatic constant state and has visually\napparent non-stationarity, whereas the heart rate in heart disease is associated\nwith the emergence of excessive regularity or uncorrelated randomness. A\nconstant heart rate was observed in the case of a coma [78], demonstrating\nagain that some measure of irregularity is needed for health. These features\nare thought to be related to fractal and nonlinear properties. To quantify the\ncomplexity of healthy heart rate, and to detect its alterations with disease and\nwith aging represent major challenges in physiology.\nNew methods have been developed to replace the traditional approaches used\nfor stationary signals, such as power-spectral and autocorrelation analysis.\nThey can quantify accurately the \u2018long-range\u2019 correlation (see definitions in\nSec. 3.3) in non-stationary signals: these include detrended fluctuation analy-\nsis (DFA) [79,80] and the detrended moving average method (DMA) [81\u201383].\nThey too are based on the idea of a fractal in nonlinear theory. The fractal\nconcept is extended to time series so that we can see the self-similar prop-\nerties on different timescales. DFA is a method to quantify the fractal cor-\nrelation in time series by filtering out polynomial trends as discussed below\nin Sec. 3. To avoid the assumption that the trend is necessarily polynomial,\nthe DMA method was introduced. It estimates the correlation properties of\nnon-stationary signals, the probability distribution, and other characteristic of\nstochastic processes, without any assumption of trends. These methods have\nbeen applied to financial [82], physiological [84\u201386] and biological signals [87].\nIt has been suggested that the HRV of healthy subjects shows self-similar\n(scale-invariant) fluctuations over a wide range of timescales, and that disease\nor aging make HRV less complex (with higher regularity and predictability).\nBased on DFA analysis, it was reported that complexity decreases with in-\ncreasing age [49, 88]. The physiological background to the loss of complexity\nwith age has been studied extensively. It has not been fully elucidated, but\nchanges in the balance between two branches (sympathetic and vagal) of the\n8\nautonomic nervous system are thought to contribute to changes in the com-\nplexity of heart rate [89].\n1.4 Spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and aging\nFollowing the pioneering work of Penaz et al. [1] and Hyndman et al. [2] on\noscillatory processes in the ECG, Sayers [90] and Luczak and Lauring [91]\nstudied rhythms in beat-to-beat heart rate signals. Akselrod et al. in 1981 [3]\nintroduced spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) as a noninvasive\nmeans of evaluating beat-to-beat cardiovascular control. In addition to the\nrespiratory oscillations in HRV around 0.3 Hz at what were called high fre-\nquencies (HF), spectral peaks were reported at low frequencies (LF) around\n0.1 Hz, and at very low frequencies (VLF) below 0.05 Hz [2,3]; this work was\nbased on relatively short-term recordings. Ultra-low frequency (UFL) com-\nponents were later observed in 24-h long-term recordings [92]. Many studies\nhave investigated how sympathetic and parasympathetic activities affect these\ncomponents. HF is considered to represent vagal control of heart rate and LF\ncontains contributions from both the vagal and sympathetic nervous systems.\nThe ratio LF\/HF is regarded by many researchers as a measure of sympatho-\nvagal balance [93].\nHowever, the majority of these studies were done by FFT and autoregressive\n(AR) spectral estimation [92]. By these methods, frequencies below 0.05 Hz\ncould not be studied (see above). To overcome this deficiency, Lotric\u02c7 et al [94]\nused the wavelet transform for spectral analysis, enabling them to study age-\nrelated spectral changes in the range 0.0095\u20130.6 Hz. In what follows, we discuss\nan additional frequency interval, 0.005-0.0095 Hz, and we also consider gender\ndifferences, which were not mentioned by Lotric\u02c7 et al, as well as aging.\n1.5 Structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system with age\nCardiovascular structure and function change with age, affecting the function\nof the heart and other organs, and perhaps causing diseases.\nOne of the major changes with aging is the remodeling of large arteries, when\nthere is an increase in wall thickness and enlargement of the lumen. Arterial\nstiffening is another hallmark of arterial aging [95]. The geometry and diastolic\nfunction of the left ventriculum alters substantially with age [96].\nAlso associated with aging, there are alterations in the function of the en-\ndothelium, the layer of cells between the blood and vascular smooth muscle\ncells in blood vessels. Endothelial control of vasomotor tone changes with age\n9\nand the alteration impairs vascular adaptation to variations in flow, especially\nthose induced by exercise and ischemia. The endothelium normally releases\nvasoactive substances, such as nitric oxide (NO), but its ability to do so also\nchanges with age. An impairment of endothelial-dependent relaxation, which is\nmediated especially by NO, is observed in aged subjects. Most studies indicate\nthat aging is associated with a decrease in NO production and release [97].\n1.6 Blood flow with iontophoresis and aging\nThe endothelium was once thought to serve just as passive lining for the blood\nvessels. However Furchgott and Zawadzki 1980 [98] found that the relaxation\nevoked by acetylcholine in the rabbit aorta is mediated only in the presence of\nendothelium, and numerous later studies have confirmed that the endothelium\nplays an important role in regulating local vascular tone. It does so by releasing\nvasodilating and vasoconstricting substances.\nIontophoresis is a technique that allows for transdermal delivery of polar drugs\nthough the skin by passing a small current. Here, we are especially interested in\ndelivering the vasoactive endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent\nsubstances acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) respectively.\nDetails are provided in Appendix B.2.3. Iontophoresis has been widely used\nto assess how endothelial vasodilation changes with essential hypertension,\nheart failure, arteriosclerosis and exercise, as well as aging. Blood flow was\nmeasured by using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) at the sites into which\nACh and SNP were delivered by iontophoresis and then the blood flow signals\nwere analyzed by wavelet transform according to [99]. This is a non-invasive\nmeasurement that enables one to acquire the data to assess the state of the\nhuman cardiovascular system in vivo. It has been especially useful in identi-\nfying the physiological origins of the several spectral peaks revealed in earlier\nstudies [99\u2013104], such as the endothelial, neurogenic and myogenic, as well the\nrespiratory and cardiac components [105]. The combination of ionotphoresis\nand wavelet analysis allows endothelial function to be compared between sub-\njects of different ages by focussing on the frequency interval(s) corresponding\nto endothelial activity.\nEarlier aging studies of blood flow based on iontophoresis have in some cases\nreported that endothelial-dependent vasodilation decreased with increasing\nage [47,48]. There are also some studies in which gender difference in endothelial-\ndependent vasodilation were observed [106,107]. But wavelet analysis was not\nused, and neither were the relevant oscillatory components examined individ-\nually. Here we review LDF measurement of blood flow combined with both\niontophoresis and wavelet analysis and we show that this combination is very\nrevealing.\n10\n2 Instantaneous frequency and phase\n2.1 Description of phase dynamics\nIn this section, we review briefly the phase dynamics approach to coupled\noscillatory systems, following Kuramoto [24]. Phase dynamics provides a way\nof describing a system with only one variable, the phase. We first explain how\nthe phase is defined and how its dynamics is obtained by use of one of the\nreduction methods that will be explained below in more detail.\n2.1.1 Small perturbations in general\nSuppose that X(t) develops its dynamics according to dX\/dt = F(X) and\nthat there is a linearly stable T -periodic solution X0 which satisfies\ndX0\ndt\n= F(X0), X0(t+ T ) = X0(t). (1)\nLet C denote a closed orbit corresponding to X0. Clearly the phase \u03c6 can be\ndefined on C as a variable linearly increasing with time, as follows,\nd\u03c6(X)\ndt\n= \u03c9, \u03c9 =\n2pi\nT\n, X \u2208 C. (2)\nNow let us add a small perturbation p(t) to the dynamics. At this stage,\np(t) can be anything. It may depend on the variable X or on the variables of\nother oscillators. The dynamics of X can then be expressed in the following\nequation,\ndX\ndt\n= F(X) + p(t). (3)\nOnce the perturbation has been added, the orbit does not correspond exactly\nto C, but is expected to be a bit away from C. Consequently, the phase needs\nto be defined, not only on C, but also throughout the region close to C: the\ndefinition can be extended to the region G containing the neighborhood of C\nin the case of the dynamical system dX\/dt = F(X). All paths starting from\nI(\u03c6) approach the point starting from X0(\u03c6) on C, the crossing point of C\nand I(\u03c6) (shown in Fig. 1 as t \u2192 \u221e). It means that the phase of the same\nisochrone remains the same. The following equation then leads to\n(gradX\u03c6,F(X)) = \u03c9, (4)\n11\nwhere (a,b) represents the inner product of vectors a and b.\nl i m i t - c y c l e  o r b i t  C\ni s o c h r o n e  I\nX 0 (   )\nI (   )\nFig. 1. Explanation of the isochrone. The closed curve represents the limit cycle\norbit C. Curves on which all the points have the same phase are called isochrones,\nI(\u03c6). A crossing point of C and I(\u03c6) is written as X0(\u03c6). The centre of the limit\ncycle C, where all the isochrones meet, is a singular point where the phase cannot\nbe defined.\nNote that the definition of phase is made for the perturbation-free system, but\nit can also be applied to the system in the presences of the perturbation.\nBy introducing this phase variable, the dynamics in the region G is finally\ndescribed as\nd\u03c6(X)\ndt\n= (gradX\u03c6,F(X) + p(t)) = \u03c9 + (gradX\u03c6,p(t)). (5)\nIt should be noted that gradX\u03c6 on the right-hand side is a function of position\nX, and that Eq. (5) is not a closed equation for the phase \u03c6. However, if the\nperturbation is small, the value can be calculated approximately on the value\non C as\nU\u2217(\u03c6) \u2261 gradX\u03c6|X0(\u03c6). (6)\nBy use of thisU\u2217, the phase equation under perturbation p(t) can be obtained\nas\nd\u03c6\ndt\n= \u03c9 + (U\u2217(\u03c6),p(t)). (7)\nIf the perturbation is given and it is a function of \u03c6, Eq. (7) can be closed in\nterms of \u03c6. We now consider a few examples.\n12\n2.1.2 Small deviation from the original dynamical system\nIn this subsection, we discuss the case where the dynamical equation deviates\nfrom F(X) to F(X)+ \u03b4F(X). In this case, p(t) = \u03b4F(X) and Eq. (7) becomes\nd\u03c6\ndt\n= \u03c9 + (U\u2217(\u03c6), \u03b4F(X)). (8)\nIn the first approximation, \u03b4F(X) can be replaced by \u03b4F(X0(\u03c6)). Then Eq.\n(8) becomes\nd\u03c6\ndt\n= \u03c9 + (U\u2217(\u03c6), \u03b4F(X0(\u03c6))). (9)\nThis is closed for \u03c6. An important operation called averaging is implemented\nin the next step by introduction of a new variable \u03c8 as\n\u03c6 = \u03c9t+ \u03c8. (10)\nWithout the perturbation, \u03c8 is a variable independent of time and it represents\nthe initial phase, but under small perturbation it is a variable that changes\nslowly with time. The dynamics of \u03c8 becomes\nd\u03c8\ndt\n= (U\u2217(\u03c9t+ \u03c8), \u03b4F(X0(\u03c9t+ \u03c8))). (11)\nBecause its dynamics is very slow, \u03c8 can be considered as approximately\nconstant during one period 2pi\/T . In fact, \u03c8 is so slow compared to \u03c9t that it\nis expected that the averaging of the right hand side occurs on the time scale\nof \u03c8. The dynamics of \u03c8 can thus be expressed as\nd\u03c8\ndt\n= \u03b4\u03c9, (12)\n\u03b4\u03c9\u2261 1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03b8(U\u2217(\u03b8 + \u03c8), \u03b4F(X0(\u03b8 + \u03c8))). (13)\nIt should be noted that \u03b4\u03c9 is not dependent on \u03c8, but constant, since the inte-\ngrated function in the right hand side is a 2pi-periodic function. The equation\nd\u03c6\ndt\n= \u03c9 + \u03b4\u03c9 (14)\nindicates that the deviation of the original dynamical system leads to a devi-\nation of the frequency in the phase dynamics, i.e. frequency modulation.\n13\n2.2 Analytic methods to detect instantaneous phase\nIn analysing cardiovascular (and many other) signals, the first thing that we\nhave to do is to define their phases quantitatively. There are three methods for\ndefining instantaneous phase. They are based respectively on peak-detection,\nthe Hilbert transform, and the wavelet transform. The first method can be\nused to study entrainment directly [108] or to obtain instantaneous phase [109].\nThe second method was originally introduced by Gabor [110] and brought into\nthe context of synchronization by Rosenblum et al. [111]. The third wavelet-\nbased method was introduced by Lachaux et al [112] and independently by\nBandrivskyy et al. [113]. Wavelet analysis is explained in Sec. 4.1.4. Phase\nsynchronization between EEG signals from the right and left hemispheres of a\nrat\u2019s brain was investigated by use of both the Hilbert and wavelet transforms\nby Quiroga et al [114] who found that they obtained similar results by the two\nmethods.\n2.2.1 Marked events\nIf each cycle of a signal contains distinctive events that can be marked to\ncharacterize the oscillator, the phase can be defined by using the times of\nthese events,\n\u03c6(t) = 2pi\nt\u2212 tk\ntk+1 \u2212 tk + 2pik, tk < t < tk+1, (15)\nwhere tk and tk+1 are the time of the k-th and (k + 1)-th marked events.\nBy this definition, the phase increases linearly with time. It should be noted\nthat this method corresponds to phase definition via Poincare\u00b4 section [109]. In\nsome cases, we can find a projection of an orbit on a plane (x, y) that rotates\naround a point (x0, y0). We can choose a Poincare\u00b4 section, and tk is then the\ntime of the k-th crossing of the Poincare\u00b4 surface. In our case, the Poincare\u00b4\nSec. will be defined by the plane of y = max.\n2.2.2 Hilbert transform\nWhen a signal g(t) is obtained, there is a way to establish its amplitude and\nphase by constructing the so-called analytic signal \u03b6(t) from the original signal\ng(t), according to the equation\n\u03b6(t) = g(t) + \u0131gH(t) = A(t)e\n\u0131\u03c6(t), (16)\n14\nwhere gH(t) is the Hilbert transform of g(t) written as\ngH(t) = pi\n\u22121PV\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ng(\u03c4)\nt\u2212 \u03c4 d\u03c4. (17)\nHere PV means evaluation of the integral in the sense of the Cauchy principal\nvalue. The instantaneous amplitude A(t) and phase \u03c6(t) are determined by\nEq. (16). Then the phase can be calculated as\n\u03c6(t) = arctan\ngH(t)\ng(t)\n. (18)\nNote that the phase obtained by this method ranges from \u2212pi to pi.\nFrom Eq. (17), it can be seen that the Hilbert transform is the convolution\nof the functions g(t) and 1\/pit. According to a property of convolution, the\nFourier transform g\u02c6H of gH(t) is the product of the Fourier transform of g(t)\nand 1\/pit. For physically relevant Fourier frequencies f > 0, g\u02c6H(f) = \u2212\u0131g\u02c6(f),\nwhich means that the Hilbert transform can be seen as a filter whose amplitude\nresponse is unity and whose phase response is a pi\/2 lag at all frequencies.\nIt should be remarked that this method is reasonable only when the original\nsignal g(t) is a narrow-band one. Real signals usually contain a wide range\nof frequencies because of noise or other factors, and some filtering may be\nnecessary in order to use this method.\n2.3 Application to cardiovascular signals\n2.3.1 Heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory frequency variability (RFV)\nThe instantaneous frequencies can be introduced by using phase information\nobtained according to the methods described above. If the phase reaches 2pi\nfor the k-th and (k+1)-th time at tk and tk+1 respectively, the instantaneous\nfrequency fi is defined as\nfi(tk,k+1) =\n1\n(tk+1 \u2212 tk) where tk,k+1 =\n(tk + tk+1)\n2\n. (19)\nThe instantaneous frequency between tk,k+1 and tk+1,k+2 is defined by linear\ninterpolation as\nfi(t) =\nf(tk+1,k+2)\u2212 f(tk,k+1)\ntk+1,k+2 \u2212 tk,k+1 (t\u2212 tk,k+1) + fi(tk,k+1), tk,k+1 < t < tk+1,k+2.(20)\n15\nThis method is applied to an individual signal, e.g. to either or both of the\nECG and respiratory signals. The first part of the analysis is to determine\nthe heart rate (HR) and the respiratory frequency (RF). Their instantaneous\nfrequencies as functions of time are then heart rate variability (HRV) and res-\npiratory frequency variability (RFV), respectively. HR and RF are normally\nused to represent time-averaged values or values at one instant, rather than as\nfunctions of time. HRV is a well-established indicator for cardiac regulation.\nThe existence of fluctuations in heart rate was noticed as early as 1733 by\nHales [115], related to the respiratory oscillation. This modulation is known\nas respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA has sometimes been assessed re-\ngardless of any distinction of frequency interval within HRV, for example by\nusing RSA curves [116, 117], and sometimes assessed by the spectral power\ncorresponding to the frequency interval of respiration [118]. In our work, we\nuse the latter method for assessing RSA. Actual examples of HRV and RFV\nsignals are shown in Fig. 2, where the RSA can be seen. These values relate\nto single periods during which the phase starts from zero and resets to 2pi. As\nexplained in subsection 2.1.2, the variation of the frequency of HRV and RFV\ncan be considered to come from the term of (U\u2217(\u03c6),p(t)) in Eq. (7), where the\nperturbation p(t) can be the parameter change described in subsection 2.1.2\nand the coupling to other oscillators such as the respiratory oscillation as we\ndiscuss below in section 5.1. The respiratory oscillation evidently has an espe-\ncially important role in modulating the heart rate, given that HRV contains\nan oscillatory component corresponding to respiration [5]. The spectral analy-\nsis of HRV will be discussed in subsection 4.3.1, where the origin of the other\noscillatory processes modulating the heart rate will also be discussed.\n2.3.2 Effects of ageing on heart rate (HR) and respiration frequency (RF)\nIt is well known that the standard deviation of (instantaneous) HR decreases\nsignificantly with age [38, 39, 41, 120]. In Fig. 3, we present the results of 30-\nmin recordings conducted according to the procedures of Appendix B. The\nmethod used for calculating the average and standard deviations of HR and\nRF is described in the caption of Fig. 2: we calculated Spearman\u2019s rank corre-\nlation coefficients and their statistical significance using the method described\nin Appendix C.2.2, implemented using MatLab (MatWork). Since Spearman\u2019s\nrank correlation coefficient does not suppose a particular relationship between\ntwo variables, we do not plot any fitting curve but only the correlation co-\nefficients. We denote the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient by \u03c1, the\nlinear correlation coefficient by r and the significance probability for each\nby p. There is significant correlation with age in the standard deviation of\n(instantaneous) HR both for males (\u03c1 = \u22120.33, p = 0.01) and for females\n(\u03c1 = \u22120.33, p = 0.01), where by a significant correlation we mean p <= 0.05.\nThe other values, average (instantaneous) HR, average (instantaneous) RF\nand the standard deviation of (instantaneous) RF do not show significant cor-\n16\nt\nc(j) tc(j+1)tc(j+2)tc(j+3)tc(j+4)tc(j+5)tc(j+6)tc(j+7)tc(j+8)tc(j+9)\nEC\nG\n0.9\n1.0\nH\nR\nV \n(H\nz)\nt\nr(i) tr(i+1) tr(i+2)\nR\nes\np\n598 600 602 604 606 608\n0.28\n0.3\nR\nFV\n (H\nz)\nTime (sec)\n0.9\n1.1\nH\nR\nV \n(H\nz)\n0 300 600 900 1200 1500 1800\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nR\nFV\n (H\nz)\nTime (sec)\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nFig. 2.

Next, we compared the differences\nbetween males and females in each age group by using the Wilcoxon rank sum\ntest, which is discussed in Appendix C.1.2.

Throughout this review, all correlations with age were quantified\nby the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients and all comparisons between\ntwo groups based on our data were conducted by the Wilcoxon rank sum test.\nThe significant decrease in the standard deviation of (instantaneous) HR men-\ntioned above was reported, not only for 30-min recordings, but also for 24-hour\nones, enabled by a recent development in measurement technology, the Holter\nmonitor. Even for these longer recordings, the trend still holds, as shown in\nFig. 4 by Umetani et al [119].\nThere are, however, some differences in the results reported by different au-\nthors. For example, Stein et al. [120] reported that there is a significant de-\ncrease in average heart rate for male, whereas Umetani et al. [119] reported\nthat the significant decrease in heart rate is only for females. Ryan et al. [38]\nreported that average heart rate did not change between young and aged\ngroups, as we observed. Umetani et al. [119] observed that the standard devi-\n18\nFig. 4.

The\ndifference probably comes from the difference of recording time, the number\nof subjects and life style of the subjects. Note also that 24-hour recordings\ncontain the effects and artifacts resulting from the subjects day-to-day lives,\nwhereas 30-min recordings are made for subjects that are relaxed and lying\non a bed. There is a report by Dietrich et al. that life style factors such as\nexercise, alcohol and smoking affect HRV. Nonetheless, the decrease of HRV\n(the decrease of the standard deviation of HR) with age seems to be robust.\n3 Complexity analysis\n3.1 Overview of existing results\nIn this section, we overview results obtained before the introduction of de-\ntrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and detrended moving analysis (DMA).\nThe history of development in these latter areas has already been described\nabove in Sec. 1.3\nThe complexity is independent of the mean and variance of a signal, and\nspecial techniques are required for its determination. Note e.g. that two sine\nwaves of different amplitude can be thought to have the same complexity,\nalthough they have different variances.\n19\nChaos theory provides meaningful ways of quantifying complexity. One is the\ndimension, which is interpreted as the number of variables in the difference\nor differential equations needed to construct a dynamical system that will\nreproduce the measured signals. Another is the entropy, which is related to\nthe amount of information needed to predict the future state of the system.\nA larger dimension or a larger entropy imply greater complexity. When the\napproximate dimension and entropy ApEn were calculated in the signals of the\nblood pressure and heart rate [41], it was observed that younger subjects have\nhigher complexity than older people in all cases: for both blood pressure and\nHRV, and for the both measures. Ryan et al. calculated ApEn and reported\nthat the complexity of heart rate dynamics is higher in women than in men\n[38]. Higuchi suggested quantification of the complexity based on the fractal\ndimension [121,122]. By this method, fractal changes in heart rate with aging\nand heart failure were studied [123]. The relationship between complexity and\naging has been reviewed by Lipsitz et. al. [42].\nMost of the signals or time series measured from physical, biological, phys-\niological and economic systems are non-stationary in character and exhibit\ncomplex self-similar fluctuations over a broad range of space or time scales.\nTo see the scaling property, a time series is expected to grow with the window\nsize in a power-law way, and to be unbounded. But a real signal is inevitably\nbounded. The trick for solving this paradox is to integrate the signals. The\nintegration of a signal is the critical first step common to all the methods\nused to calculate the complexity. Starting with an original signal g(i), where\ni = 1, . . . , N , and N is the length of the signal, the first step of the Hurst ex-\nponent, DFA, and DMA methods is to integrate g(i) and obtain the integrated\nsignal y(i) as\ny(i) =\ni\u2211\nj=1\n[g(j)\u2212 g\u00af], (21)\nwhere\ng\u00af \u2261 1\nN\nN\u2211\nj=1\ng(j). (22)\nTo calculate the Hurst exponent, we have to calculate the standard deviation,\nS(N) = [\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nt=1\n{g(i)\u2212 g\u00af}2]1\/2, (23)\nand the range,\nR(N) = max\n1\u2264i\u2264N\ny(i)\u2212 min\n1\u2264i\u2264N\ny(i). (24)\n20\nThe Hurst exponent H is then defined as\nR\/S = (cN)H , (25)\nwhere the coefficient c was taken as 0.5 by Hurst. He found that the ratio R\/S\nis very well described for a large number of natural phenomena by the above\nempirical relation. The relation between the Hurst exponent and the fractal\ndimension is simply D = 2\u2212H.\nA Hurst exponent of 0.5 < H < 1 represents persistent behavior. Persistence\nmeans that if the curve has been increasing for a period, it is expected to\ncontinue for another period. A Hurst exponent of 0 < H < 0.5 shows anti-\npersistent behavior. After a period of decreases, a period of increases tends to\noccur.\n3.2 Analytical methods: Detrended Moving Analysis (DMA) and Detrended\nFluctuation Analysis (DFA)\nThe DFA method is a modified root-mean-square (rms) analysis of a random\nwalk. Both the DMA and DFA methods are based on the fractal property.\nFollowing [79,80], we summarize below the procedures for implementation.\nA time series is self-similar if it satisfies\ny(i) \u2261 a\u03b1y( i\na\n), (26)\nwhere y(i) is the integrated original signal g(i), and \u2261 means that the statis-\ntical properties of both sides of the equation are identical (both sides have the\nidentical probability distribution as a properly rescaled process). The x-axis\nis rescaled as t\u2192 t\/a and the y-axis as y \u2192 a\u03b1y.\nSuppose that the original signal length is n2, and that a window of length\nn1 < n2 is taken to test for self-similarity compared to the original signal.\nThen the magnification factor of the x-axis, a, is n2\/n1. Suppose that the\nprobability distribution is s2 for the original signal and s1 after magnification.\nThen the magnification factor of the y-axis a\u03b1 is s2\/s1. The self-similarity\nparameter \u03b1 is expressed as\n\u03b1 =\nlnMx\nlnMy\n=\nln s2 \u2212 ln s1\nlnn2 \u2212 lnn1 . (27)\nTo calculate s, the DFA method uses filtering by polynomial functions. At\nfirst, the integrated signal y(i) is divided into boxes of equal length n. In each\n21\nbox, we fit y(i) using a polynomial function yn(i), which represents the local\ntrend in that box. When an lth-order polynomial function is used for filtering,\nwe call the method DFA-l.\nNext, the integrated profile y(i) is detrended by subtracting the local trend\nyn(i) in each box of length n and we can get Yn as\nYn(i) \u2261 y(i)\u2212 yn(i). (28)\nBy this procedure, non-stationarity in the form of polynomial trends is elimi-\nnated.\nFinally, for each box, the rms fluctuation of the integrated and detrended\nsignal is defined as\nF (n) \u2261\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[Yn(i)]2 (29)\nand F (n) is then considered as s in the above discussion.\nThe DMA method uses a moving average method to get yn. For example, the\nsimple backward moving average is\nyn(i) \u2261 1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=0\ny(i\u2212 k). (30)\nFor further details, see [124]. Then we subtract the trend yn from the original\nsignal as in Eq. (28). We can calculate F (n) in the same way.\nThe calculation of F (n) is made for varied box lengths n to obtain a power-law\nrelationship between the rms fluctuation function F (n) and the scale n in the\nform of\nF (n) \u223c n\u03b1. (31)\nA linear relationship between log(F (n)) and log(n) indicates the presence of\nscaling (self-similarity). The fluctuations in the small boxes are related to those\nin the larger boxes in a power-law fashion. The slope of the graph between\nlog(F (n)) and log(n) determines the self-similarity parameter \u03b1, which quan-\ntifies the presence or absence of fractal correlation properties in the signals.\nFor example, 1\/f noise with long-range correlation returns \u03b1 ' 1.0, white\nnoise with uncorrelated randomness returns \u03b1 ' 0.5 and Brown noise returns\n\u03b1 ' 1.5.\n22\nBecause power laws are scale-invariant, F (n) is also called the scaling function\nand the parameter \u03b1 is the scaling exponent.\nThese two methods are both suitable for non-stationary signals such as the\nphysiological signals described before. Which method is better, DMA or DFA?\nThere is a comparative study about the performance of DFA and DMA meth-\nods [124]. It investigated how accurately these methods reproduce the expo-\nnent \u03b1, and the limitations of the methods when applied to signals with small\nor large values of \u03b1. It was shown [124] that DMA tends to underestimate\nthe exponent, if it is larger than unity whereas the DFA, especially DFA-1,\nshows relatively good correspondence to the true values over a wide range of\n\u03b1. In our study, the exponents went beyond unity and therefore we adopted\nthe DFA-1 approach.\nFig. 5.

However it was discovered that in a system composed of\nmany interacting subsystems, it decays not exponentially but in a power-law\nform [19, 125]. This implies that there is no single characteristic time in a\n23\ncomplex system. If correlations decay in a power-law manner, the system is\ncalled scale-free because there is no characteristic scale associated with a power\nlaw. Because at large time-scales a decreasing power law gives larger values\nthan a decaying exponential function, correlations described by power laws\nare termed \u201clong range correlations\u201d in the sense that they are of larger range\nthan an exponentially decaying function. The DFA method can detect such\nlong range correlations and here we will discuss the relationship between the\nexponent and the correlation function.\nThe exponent \u03b1 (self-similarity parameter) which is calculated from an in-\ntegrated time series is related to the more familiar auto-correlation function,\nC(\u03c4), or the Fourier spectrum, S(f), of the original (non-integrated) signal. (It\nis well known that C(\u03c4) and S(f) are related through the Fourier transform\nas S(f) =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221eC(\u03c4) exp(\u01312pif\u03c4)d\u03c4 .)\nWhite noise, whose value at each moment is completely uncorrelated with\nany previous value, has an auto-correlation function, C(\u03c4), which is 0 for any\nnon-zero \u03c4 (time-lag). The exponent \u03b1 of white noise is 0.5 [75].\nAn \u03b1 greater than 0.5, and less than or equal to 1.0, indicates persistent\nlong-range power-law correlations, i.e., C(\u03c4) \u223c \u03c4\u2212\u03b3. The relationship between\n\u03b1 and \u03b3 is \u03b3 = 2 \u2212 2\u03b1 . It should also be noted that the power spectrum,\nS(f), of the original (non-integrated) signal is also of a power-law form, i.e.,\nS(f) \u223c 1\/f\u03b2. Since the power spectral density is simply the Fourier transform\nof the autocorrelation function, \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b3 = 2\u03b1 \u2212 1. The case of \u03b1 = 1\ncorresponds to 1\/f noise (\u03b2 = 1).\nWhen \u03b1 < 0.5, power-law anti-correlations are present such that large values\nare more likely to be followed by small values [126].\nWhen \u03b1 > 1, correlations exist but cease to be of power-law form; \u03b1 = 1.5\nindicates Brown noise, which is created by the integration of white noise.\nUnlike white noise, Brown noise is correlated because its instantaneous value\ndepends on previous fluctuations and cannot stray too far from them in a\nshort time. Brown noise has a spectral density proportional to 1\/f 2 and has\nstronger modulation in slow time scales.\nThe exponent \u03b1 can also be viewed as an indicator of the roughness of the\noriginal time series: the larger the value of \u03b1, the smoother the time series.\nIn this context, 1\/f noise can be interpreted as a compromise between the\ncomplete unpredictability of white noise (a very rough form of noise) and the\nmuch smoother form of Brown noise [127].\n24\n3.4 Application to cardiovascular signals\n3.4.1 Application to HRV signals\nAs shown in Sec. 2.3.2, HRV exhibits a significant negative correlation with\nage. HRV has also been considered in terms of complexity analysis, yielding\nresults that we review in this subsection.\nWe first discuss the results of Goldberger et al. [44]. They analyzed interbeat\nintervals (the reciprocal of HRV), and reported that the result for a healthy\nsubject is consistent with long-range correlations (1\/f noise). This was con-\nfirmed by an analysis of surrogate data, which revealed a loss of correlation\nproperties as shown in Fig. 6. Further, it was reported by Peng et al [128] that\nsubjects with heart failure, and elderly subjects, show alterations in both short\nand long range correlation properties compared with healthy young subjects,\nas shown in Fig. 7. For example, the fluctuations of elderly subjects resembled\nBrown noise (\u03b1 ' 1.5) over a short range, whereas those of the heart failure\npatients resembled white noise (\u03b1 ' 0.5).\nFig. 6. Fractal scaling analysis\nfor 24-hr interbeat interval time\nanalysis. The filled circles repre-\nsent data from a healthy sub-\nject, whereas the open circles are\nfor an artificial time series (sur-\nrogate data) created by random-\nizing the sequential order of data\npoints in the original time series.\n(A) Plot of log F (n) as a func-\ntion of log(n) from DFA analy-\nsis. (B) Fourier spectral analysis.\nThe spectra have been smoothed\n(binned) to reduce scatter. The\nobserved \u03b1 ' 1.0, \u03b2 ' 1.0 for a\nhealthy subject is consistent with\n1\/f noise. After randomization,\n\u03b1 ' 0.5, \u03b2 ' 0.0 is consistent with\nwhite noise. The figure is taken\nfrom [44].\n25\nFig. 7. Scaling analyses of heart-\nbeat time series in health, aging\nand disease. Log F (n) is plotted as\na function of log(n) for a healthy\nyoung subject, a healthy elderly\nsubject, and a subject with con-\ngestive heart failure. To facilitate\nassessment of these scaling differ-\nences, the plots are vertically off-\nset from each other. The figure is\ntaken from [128].\nIn order to check the robustness of our conclusions about the effect of aging\non complexity, we calculated the exponent \u03b1 of signals analysed by use of the\nDFA method. Original HRV signals of a young and an old female, recorded by\nourselves, are shown in Fig. 8, together with white and Brown noise signals\nfor comparison. The HRV signals were determined from the intervals between\nR-peaks as explained in section 2.3.1. The interval between successive R-peaks\nis usually around 1 second. According to Eq. (19), the sampling frequency of\nHRV signal is by construction around 1 Hz although we made their effective\nsampling frequency 10 Hz by linear interpolation. To compare HRV signals\nto white noise and Brown noise, we generated and recorded white noise with\na sampling frequency 1 Hz and extended its sampling frequency to 10 Hz by\nlinear interpolation, just as we did to the HRV signals. Then the Brown noise\nwith sampling frequency 1 Hz was integrated from the band-limited white\nnoise that we had generated, and its sampling frequency was also extended to\n10 Hz by linear interpolation.\nWe take the number of points n between 20 and 2000, corresponding to 2\u2013\n200 sec. DFA results for white noise, Brown noise and the HRV signals from\na young and an old female are shown in Fig. 9. When n is small, the slope be-\ntween log(n) and log(F ) deviates from 0.5 for white noise, as shown in Fig. 9a;\nthis deviation is thought to be attributable to a too-small sampling frequency.\nFig. 10 shows the time series of the white noise with sampling frequency of\n10 Hz without linear interpolation, and its DFA analysis, to compare with the\nband-limited white noise generated with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz and\nthen converted to an effective sampling frequency of 10 Hz by linear inter-\npolation. In Fig. 10, an exponent of \u223c0.5 is obtained within the region from\nn = 20 to n = 200, and the information below n = 100 does not have to be\ndiscarded as we did in the case of the band-limited white noise converted to an\neffective sampling frequency of 10 Hz by linear interpolation. For this reason,\nwe relied on the result only when n is above 100, for all the other results, since\nthey have the same sampling frequency as the band-limited white noise.\n26\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\nWhite noise\n\u22125\n0\n5\nBrown noiseb\nc\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nH\nR\nV \n(H\nz) A young female\n0 300 600 900 1200 1500 1800\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nH\nR\nV \n(H\nz)\nTime (sec)\nAn aged female\na\nd\nFig. 8. Time series of (a) white noise band-limited at 1Hz, (b) its integrated time\nseries (Brown noise), (c) HRV from a young female and (d) HRV from an aged\nfemale.\nThe exponent of the band-limited white noise is 0.51, which is close to the\nexpected value of 0.5, as shown in Fig. 9a. We calculated the linear correlation\ncoefficient and conducted a runs test as explained in Appendix C, in order to\nvalidate the linear regression. The coefficient r is 0.99 and the probability p is\n0.0. The result of the runs test is that h = 0 and p = 1.0, which means that\nthe null hypothesis that the distribution around the regression line is random\ncannot be rejected. The exponent of the Brown noise is 1.46, which is also\nclose to the expected value of 1.50, as shown in Fig. 9b (the linear correlation:\nr = 1.00 and p = 0.0, the runs test h = 0 and p = 1.0). The exponents of\nhuman HRV signals cannot be determined uniquely, as in the case of white or\nBrown noise, because the slope between log(F ) and log(n) changes depending\non the size of n, as shown at the bottom of Fig. 9. We divided the n into two\nintervals so that the slope of HRV could be determined more reliably. The\nexponent \u03b1i of intermediate time scale is defined by n within 100\u2013500 (10\u2013\n50 sec) and the exponent \u03b1l of long time scale is defined by 500 < n < 2000\n(50\u2013200 sec). The physiological meaning of each interval will be described\nbelow in section 4.3.1. For the HRV of a young female, \u03b1i is 0.85 (the linear\ncorrelation: r = 1.0 and p = 0.0, the runs test h = 0 and p = 1.0) and \u03b1l is\n0.53 (the linear correlation: r = 0.98 and p = 0.0, the runs test h = 0 and\np = 1.0). For the HRV of an aged female, the \u03b1i is 1.09 (the linear correlation:\n27\nr = 0.99 and p = 0.0, the runs test h = 0 and p = 1.0) and \u03b1l is 0.80 (the\nlinear correlation: r = 0.99 and p = 0.0, the runs test h = 0 and p = 1.0).\nThe results for all subjects are plotted separately for males and females in\nFig. 11. The exponent \u03b1i has significant correlation with age for both males\n(\u03c1 = 0.27, p = 0.02) and females (\u03c1 = 0.42, p = 0.00). There is no statistically\nsignificant gender difference in the younger age group below 40 years (p =\n0.19); for the older age group above 55 years there is a difference (p = 0.06),\nbut not one that is statistically significant.\nIn the long range (50-200 sec), there is no significant correlation related to age\nfor either males (\u03c1 = 0.01, p = 0.96) or females (\u03c1 = 0.01, p = 0.96). There is\nno significant gender difference, either: neither in the younger age group below\n40 years (p = 0.35), nor in the older age group above 55 years (p = 0.80).\n20 100 1000\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\nn\nlo\ng(F\n(n)\n)\n\u03b1=0.51\nWhite noise\n20 100 1000\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\nn\nlo\ng(F\n(n)\n)\n\u03b1=1.46\nBrown noise\n        100         1000  \n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\nn\nlo\ng(F\n(n)\n)\nA young female\n\u03b1i=0.85\n\u03b1l=0.53\nc\n        100         1000  \n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\nn\nlo\ng(F\n(n)\n)\nAn aged female\n\u03b1i=1.09\n\u03b1l=0.80\na b\nd\nFig. 9.

It was\nfound that the DFA exponents increase with age, implying that complexity\n29\nFig. 12. Singularity spectra of heart rate signals in health and disease. The function\nD(h) measures the fractal dimension of the subset that is characterized by a local\nHurst exponent of value h. (The local Hurst exponent h is related to the exponent \u03b1\nof the DFA method by the relationship \u03b1 = 1+h.) Note the broad range in values of\nh with non-zero fractal dimension for the healthy heart beat, indicating multifractal\ndynamics. In contrast, data from a representative subject with severe heart failure\nshows a much narrower range of h with non-zero fractal dimension, indicating a\nloss of multifractal complexity with a life threatening disease. The figure is taken\nfrom [16].\ndecreases with age. The exponents depend on the time window within which\none performs the calculation. These authors took a size of 4 to 11 seconds for\nthe short-term exponent and a size more than 11 seconds for the intermediate-\nterm exponent. In our case, it was found out that the result below 10 seconds\nis not correct because of the lack of information in the original heart rate\nsignals and we therefore discarded information below 10 seconds. And for\nreasons which we describe below in section 4.3.1, we divided the window size\ninto 10-50 seconds and 50-200 seconds. It should be noted that the choice of\nwindow size is of critical importance for getting correct results. Our results are\nconsistent with the earlier result that the exponent increases with age when\ncalculated on a time scale from 10 to 50 seconds. The HRV signals of younger\nsubjects are relatively close to white noise, whereas those of aged subjects are\nrelatively close to Brown noise in the intermediate time scale. That means\nthat the HRV signals of aged subjects are less complex than those of young\nsubjects. These results support the hypothesis that aging has an associated\nloss of complexity [44]. The physiological origins of this decrease in complexity\nwill be discussed in detail below, in section 4.3.1 in relation to the detailed\nspectral analysis of HRV signals.\nAlthough DFA is a good way to quantify the complexity, it has to be noted\nthat it is intended only for mono-fractal signals, to measure only one exponent\ncharacterizing a given signal. It is reported that the heart rate data of healthy\nsubjects are not mono-fractal but multi-fractal [44]. Different parts of the\nsignal may have different scaling properties. Multi-fractal signals show self-\n30\nsimilar (scale-invariant) fluctuation over a wide range of time scales, require a\nlarge number of indices to characterize their scaling properties, and are more\ncomplex than mono-fractal signals as shown in Fig. 12. For example, the slope\nbetween log(F (n)) and log(n) often changes dramatically around n = 50 as\nit can be seen in Fig. 9. It means that DFA is insufficient to identify fractal\ncorrelation, and may in fact indicate the multi-fractal property.\nIn practice, it is not always clear how to choose the optimal window size within\nwhich to conduct the linear fitting, such that the size suits all subjects, whose\nsignals may have significantly different characteristics. The more we divide a\nsignal, the less information we obtain, because the number of points for the\nlinear fitting decreases. However if we take too long a window, the assumption\nof a linear relationship between log(F (n)) and log(n) no longer holds. This is\nan inherent limitation of this method.\nBeckers et al. [129] reported that, during day-time hours, other nonlinear\nindices such as fractal dimension (FD) [130], correlation dimension (CD) [131],\napproximate entropy (ApEn) [132] and the Lyapnov exponent decrease with\nage for both males and females. Their FD results are shown in Fig. 13 as\nan example. They found in addition that the correlation with age in some\nindices disappeared during the night, especially for male subjects, i.e. there\nis day-night variation in the indices. It was also reported [129] that there is a\ntendency for higher nonlinearity during the night. The authors attribute the\nchanges to vagal modulation of the heart rate.\nAlthough more studies are needed to identify unambiguously the physiological\nreasons for the changes, it is noted that complexity is a useful measure of aging\nor disease; it has yet to be established whether or not it can discriminate\nbetween different diseases.\n4 Detection of time-varying oscillatory components\nIn this section, we discuss the methods used to detect oscillatory components\nin the measured signals.\nThere are two major difficulties in the frequency analysis of cardiovascular\nsignals. The first is the time-varying nature of the characteristic frequencies.\nAs seen in the HRV and RFV of Fig. 2, the signals do not have a constant\nperiod, but their inherent cycles always fluctuate. The second problem is the\nbroad frequency band within which the characteristic peaks are expected.\nThere is always a problem of resolution in time and frequency, for whatever\nmethod used.\n31\nFig. 13. (A) Decrease of the\nfractal dimension (FD) of\nHRV with age in male sub-\njects, r = \u22120.56 (p < 0.001),\nand (B) in female subjects,\nr = \u22120.56 (p < 0.001). The upper\nand lower lines represent the\n90% confidence intervals. There\nis no significant difference in FD\nbetween male and female sub-\njects, but the significant decrease\nwith age persists regardless of\nwhether the measurements were\nmade during day or night. A\nmore detailed analysis using age\nintervals of 10 years showed a\nstabilization in the age decline\nof the FD at the age of 40 or\nmore. The FD has correlation\nwith other nonlinear indices such\nas ApEn, DFA exponents, and\nLyapvnov exponent. The figure is\ntaken from [129].\nThe FFT constitutes the basic method of frequency analysis, and it is still\ncommonly used. But it has shortcomings when applied to the analysis of finite\nor non-stationary data. First of all, the FFT cannot follow a time-varying\nfrequency. It produces only one picture of the frequency domain from a whole\nsignal. If the signal has a time-varying frequency, the corresponding frequency\npeak is broadened. Furthermore, an abrupt change at any given instant affects\nthe whole result. To overcome these drawbacks of the FFT, the short-time\nFourier transform was introduced by Gabor [110] in which a relatively narrow\nwindow is shifted along the signal to obtain information about the evolution\nwith time, the FFT being performed within the window to obtain the current\nfrequency components (see section 4.1.1). But time and frequency resolution\nare dependent on the window length and the detection of low frequencies\ndemands a wide window. Wavelet analysis is more suitable for signals with\ntime-variable frequencies than Fourier analysis because a sudden change has\na less global effect. It is a big merit, because a single movement of the body\nduring measurement could easily destroy the entire analysis in the case of\nFFT. Moreover, it is more accurate with low frequencies because it is a scale-\nindependent method in terms of frequency (see section 4.1.4 below).\n32\n4.1 Analytical methods\n4.1.1 Fourier analysis\nThe Fourier transform is a method which detects the frequency components\nin a time-domain signal g(u) by use of the following equation,\ng\u02c6(f) =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ng(u)e\u22122pi\u0131tdu.

(36)\n4.1.2 Short time Fourier transform\nThe Fourier transform cannot deal with properties that are local in time. To\novercome this problem, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was intro-\nduced. A window w(u) of fixed length is shifted along in time t to obtain the\nlocal information around t. Information about the original signal g(u) in the\ntime-frequency domain g\u02c6(f, t) is then obtained from\ng\u02c6(f, t) =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nw(u\u2212 t)g(u)e\u22122pi\u0131tdu.

(44)\nThis means that in order to gain good time resolution, a narrow window should\nbe used but that, on the other hand, good frequency resolution and detection\nof low frequencies demands wide windows.\n34\n4.1.3 Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\nIn order to apply the Fourier transform to real signals, we have to use the\ndiscrete Fourier transform. Suppose that the original signal has a finite window\nof length T = Nts and is sampled at discrete points jts, where j = 0, . . . , N\u22121.\nThe discrete Fourier transform of the signal\nG(fk) =\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=0\ng(jts)e\n\u22122pi\u0131jk\/N (45)\nis defined only for discrete frequencies, fk = k\/T where k = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1. The\nfrequency resolution is determined by the length of the signal as 4f = 1\/T\nand the upper frequency limit fmax equals ts\/2 .\n4.1.4 Wavelet Analysis\n4.2 Methods\nWavelet analysis is a scale-independent method in terms of frequency. It uses\na mother wavelet which is based on functions of various scales. In the present\ncase, we use the Morlet mother wavelet because of the ease with which scale\ncan be converted to frequency. Within the uncertainty principle, it gives op-\ntimal time resolution for high frequencies, and optimal frequency resolution\namong the low frequency components. It can be written as\n\u03c8(u) =\n1\u221a\npi\ne\u2212iue\u2212u\n2\/2. (46)\nBy use of a scaling factor s and a centered time t, a family of nonorthogonal\nbasis functions is obtained as\n\u03a8s,t(u) = |s|\u22121\/2\u03c8(u\u2212 t\ns\n). (47)\nThe continuous wavelet transform of a signal g(u) is then defined as\ng\u02dc(s, t) =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03a8\u00afs,t(u)g(u)du, (48)\nwhere \u03a8\u00af represents the complex conjugate of \u03a8. Thus any specific scale is\navoided and the analysis becomes scale-independent in terms of frequency.\nThe spectral function g\u02dc(s, t) is complex and can be expressed in terms of\n35\nits amplitude and phase as g\u02dc(s, t) = r(s, t) exp(\u0131\u03b8(s, t)). The phase \u03b8(s, t) is\nconsidered as an instantaneous phase of the oscillation of frequency scale s at\ntime t [113].\nThe energy density of the signal in the time-scale domain is expressed as\n\u03c1(s, t) = C\u22121s\u22122|g\u02dc(s, t)|2 (49)\naccording to Kaiser [133]. The total energy of the signal g(u) is\nEtot =\u2016 g \u2016= C\u22121\n\u222b \u222b 1\ns2\n|g\u02dc(s, t)|2dsdt. (50)\nThen energy in a frequency interval from fi2 to fi1, as introduced in subsec-\ntion 4.3.1, is expressed as\nEi(fi1, fi2) =\n1\n(fi2 \u2212 fi1)(t2 \u2212 t1)\n1\/fi2\u222b\n1\/fi1\nt2\u222b\nt1\n1\ns2\n|g\u02dc(s, t)|2dsdt. (51)\nIf we use the relationship s = 1\/f and ds = \u2212df\/f 2, we can easily derive the\nfollowing equation,\nEi(fi1, fi2) =\n1\n(t2 \u2212 t1)\nfi1\u222b\nfi2\nt2\u222b\nt1\n|g\u02dc(f, t)|2dfdt =\u2016 g\u02dc \u20162 . (52)\nWe can recover \u2016 g \u2016=\u2016 g\u02dc \u20162 in analogy to Plancherel\u2019s theorem.\nThe time and frequency-averaged amplitude, or wavelet amplitude, in a fre-\nquency interval from fi2 to fi1 is expressed as\nAi(fi1, fi2) =\n1\n(fi2 \u2212 fi1)(t2 \u2212 t1)\nfi1\u222b\nfi2\nt2\u222b\nt1\n|g\u02dc(f, t)|dfdt. (53)\nIf we use the relationship s = 1\/f and ds = \u2212df\/f 2, we quickly arrive at the\nfollowing equation,\nAi(fi1, fi2) =\n1\n(fi2 \u2212 fi1)(t2 \u2212 t1)\n1\/fi2\u222b\n1\/fi1\nt2\u222b\nt1\n1\ns2\n|g\u02dc(s, t)|dsdt. (54)\nBrac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and Stefanovska denoted the averaged amplitude as the absolute am-\nplitude [134].\n36\nThe relative amplitude and energy are defined as the ratio of each of those\nquantities within a given frequency interval to that within the total frequency\ninterval, in the following way,\nai(fi1, fi2) =\nAi(fi1, fi2)\nAtot\n, (55)\nei(fi1, fi2) =\nEi(fi1, fi2)\nEtot\n. (56)\n4.2.1 Frequency resolution\nSuppose that the mother wavelet has its centre of gravity at t0, f0, in time and\nfrequency and that the corresponding deviation is 4t0 and 4f0 . The scaled\nmother wavelet \u03a8s,t has its centre at st0 and a deviation s4t0 according to\nEq. 47. The centre of \u03a8s,t in the frequency domain is expressed as\nf(s) =\n1\ns\nf0(s), (57)\nand the corresponding standard deviation as\n4f(s) = 1\ns\n4f0(s). (58)\nThen the local information around f is given in the frequency interval\n[f0\/s\u22124f0(s)\/2s, f0\/s+4f0(s)\/2s]. (59)\nThe ratio between the centre frequency f(s) and bandwidth 4f(s)\n4f(s)\nf(s)\n=\n4f0(s)\nf0(s)\n(60)\nis independent of the scaling s. This property can be seen if the time averages of\nwavelets of simple sine waves, sin(2pit), sin(0.2pit) and sin(0.02pit) are plotted\non linear and semi-log scales as shown in Fig. 14. On the semi-log scale, the\nwidth of the peak appears to be the same although on the linear scale it looks\nquite different.\nFig. 15 compares the frequency resolution achieved when an HRV signal is\nanalysed either by FFT or by wavelet transform. As described in 1.4, the\nfrequency bands of HF (0.15-0.40 Hz), LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) and VLF (0.003-\n0.04 Hz) have been identified mainly by use of the FFT.

As described\nbelow, our frequency interval of interest is from 0.005 to 2.0 Hz (see the Ta-\nble 1). According to these divisions of frequency intervals, we calculated the\nenergy and amplitude of the sine waves, sin(2pit), sin(0.2pit) and sin(0.02pit)\nby wavelet analysis. For all the three cases, the total energy is same. It reflects\nthe fact that the total energy equals\n\u222b |g(u)|2du. The absolute energy within\na certain interval depends on the square of the amplitude of oscillation and\ndoes not depend on the frequency. In the case of B sin(\u03c9t), the total energy\nof the wavelet depends only on B2, but not on \u03c9. Then the relative energy in\nthe ith interval is proportional to |Bi|2\/\u22116j=1 |Bj|2.\nOn the other hand, the amplitude of the wavelet is affected not only by the\namplitude B but also by the frequency \u03c9. To illustrate this, we use three sine\nfunctions whose total amplitudes differ. The higher the frequency, the higher\n38\nbecomes the total amplitude. However, if we calculate the absolute amplitude\nin each interval, a higher frequency produces a lower amplitude. In the case\nof sin(2pit), the total amplitude is 2.7 and A1, which is averaged from 0.6 to\n2.0 Hz, is 3.9, whereas in the case of sin(0.2pit), the total amplitude is 0.9 and\nA3, which is averaged from 0.052 to 0.145 Hz, is 18. It is because the wavelet\nhas the property that4f\/f is constant, as seen in Fig. 14b. If two frequencies,\n\u03c91 and \u03c92, lie in different intervals i1 and i2, and if the two oscillations have\nthe same amplitude, the wavelet amplitude of the lower frequency Ai1 is higher\nthan that of the higher frequency Ai2 . If the two frequencies lie in the same\ninterval such that sin(2pit) and sin(2.4pit), the relative amplitude returns the\nsame value in both cases, which is of course obvious from its definition. But\nif there are several peaks in different intervals, the interpretation of relative\namplitude is much more complicated because the information about amplitude\nand frequency in the several intervals is combined.\n4.3 Application to cardiovascular signals\n4.3.1 Components that modulate HRV\nIt is interesting to compare the Fourier transform and evolutive autoregressive\n(AR) spectral analyses, which are frequently used with HRV signals, with the\nwavelet transform. For the Fourier transform, the frequency resolution \u2206f is\ndetermined by the window length and is constant for all frequencies. For that\nreason, it was concluded that Fourier methods are inadequate for the location\nof peaks in the low frequency interval. In contrast to the Fourier transform,\n\u2206f\/f for the wavelet transform is constant. Therefore the relative frequency\nresolution remains the same over all frequency intervals. The absolute fre-\nquency resolution \u2206f for wavelet transform is actually much better in the low\nfrequency interval than in the high frequency interval, as shown in Fig. 15.\nBecause of the wide frequency range of the intervals in Table 1, the wavelet\ntransform is more suitable than the Fourier transform.\nAutoregressive spectral estimation avoids the problem of frequency discretiza-\ntion. In this method, a model of the time series is first built, and the spectrum\nof the model is considered as an estimate of the spectrum of the original time\nseries. Linear models of different order are used to represent measured signals.\nAn advantage of the wavelet transform compared to AR estimation is that it\nis calculated directly from data, and does not need modeling. The limitations\nof linear modeling, and the choice of model order, are thus avoided.\nLotric\u02c7 et al. [94] discussed the relative resolution at low frequencies provided by\nthe AR, FFT and wavelet methods as applied to HRV signals. They concluded\nthat the wavelet transform yields the best low-frequency resolution.\n39\nInterval Frequency (Hz) Physiological origin\nI 0.6-2.0 cardiac activity\nII 0.145-0.6 respiration\nIII 0.052-0.145 myogenic activity\nIV 0.021-0.052 neurogenic actibity\nV 0.0095-0.021 endothelial metabolic activity\nVI 0.005-0.0095 endothelial activity\nTable 1\nThe frequency intervals seen in blood flow oscillations, and their physiological ori-\ngins.\nFig. 16.

The time-averaged ampli-\ntude of HRV.\nIn what follows, we will be interested in the frequency intervals listed in Table 1\ntogether with the physiological processes that are believed to give rise to them.\nNote that these oscillatory components not only modulate the heart rate, but\nalso manifest directly in blood flow signals measured by LDF. It is the latter\nwith which we will be especially concerned.\nBlood flow oscillations within frequency intervals I\u2013V were investigated by\nStefanovska and co-authors [5, 99, 134]. The present study also considers a\nlower frequency interval VI that was identified more recently [101]. The am-\nplitude of the wavelet in the time-frequency domain, and the time-averaged\nwavelet spectrum are presented in Figs. 16 and 17, respectively. The physiolog-\nical origins of these spectral peaks have been thoroughly investigated through\nseveral different studies [5, 78, 99\u2013105]. A brief summary of these studies and\nconclusions drawn from them will be found in a recent status paper by Ste-\nfanovska [62]. The existence of the spectral peaks has also been confirmed in\na number of independent LDF blood flow studies [135\u2013141]. We now review\nthe intervals briefly. They are \u2013\n40\nI Around 1 Hz, corresponding to cardiac activity. The basic frequency near\n1 Hz in the ECG signal, which dominates in the blood pressure, corresponds\nto the heart rate. At rest, it varies from 0.6 in sportsmen to 1.6 Hz in subjects\nwith impaired cardiovascular systems. The effect of the heart pumping is\nmanifested in the vessels.\nII Around 0.2 Hz, corresponding to respiratory activity. Following Hales\u2019 dis-\ncovery of RSA, it has been the subject of many subsequent investigations\n[142\u2013145]. Modulation in this frequency interval corresponds closely to the\nrespiratory signal as shown in the Fig. 2, and the instantaneous respiratory\nfrequency corresponds well to the peak in the frequency domain of HRV\nwavelet analysis.\nIII Around 0.1 Hz, corresponding to myogenic activity. The heart and respi-\nratory activity serve as pumps that drive blood through the vessels. The\nlatter are themselves also able to help control blood flow via a mechanism\nknown as myogenic autoregulation. The vascular smooth muscles contract\nin response to an increase of intravascular pressure, and relax in response\nto a decrease of pressure [146, 147]. Spontaneous activity recorded in mi-\ncrovascular smooth muscle cells was shown to lie in the range 4-10 events\nper minute (0.07-0.1 Hz) [148]. It was suggested that these waves originate\nlocally from intrinsic myogenic activity of smooth muscle cells in resistance\nvessels [102, 149\u2013155]. Wavelet analysis has shown that the amplitude of\nmyogenic oscillations is increased by exercise [102, 156] and decreased by\nlocal cooling [113].\nIV Around 0.04 Hz, corresponding to neurogenic activity. The autonomous ner-\nvous system innervates the heart, lungs and blood vessels, except capillaries.\nThe continuous activity of the autonomous nervous system serves to main-\ntain the basal level of contraction of the vessels. The nerves cause the release\nof substances that affect the activities of smooth muscles, leading in turn\nto the changes in the vessels\u2019 radii and resistance. Thus the nervous system\ntakes part in vasoconstriction [157]. The peak around 0.03 Hz has been ob-\nserved in blood pressure, blood flow and HRV signals. It was hypothesized\nto originate either from metabolic [158] or from neurogenic activity [159].\nKastrup et al. [153] found out that the oscillation around 0.03 Hz disap-\npeared following local and ganglionic nerve blockade in chronically sym-\npathectomized tissue in human. They suggested that this oscillation is a\nvascular reaction of neurogenic origins. In an LDF study [160] of rabbit\nskeletal muscle tissues, the oscillations of frequency of 1-3 per minute were\nsuggested as being under neurogenic control. By use of wavelet analysis,\nit was confirmed that this frequency range is associated with sympathetic\nnerve activity [104, 161]. It was found that there were significantly lower\noscillation amplitudes on flaps of transplanted skin, as compared to those\nfor intact skin, in this frequency interval [105]. Bajrovic\u00b4 et al. also observed\na significant change before and after denervation in rats [162]. An indepen-\ndent study has confirmed these findings by simultaneous measurements of\nLDF signals on the surfaces of a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap\n41\nand on the adjacent intact skin of a healthy limb [139]. Recent studies of\nthe effects of local an\u00e6sthesia by Landsverk et al [161] have confirmed the\nconnection between sympathetic activity and the spectral peak in interval\nIV.\nV Around 0.01 Hz, corresponding to NO-related endothelial activity. The\nblood supplies the cells with nutrients and removes the waste products of\ntheir metabolism while circulating around the circuit of vessels. The sub-\nstances related to metabolism such as O2 or CO2 have a direct effect on\nthe state of contraction of the vascular musculature. The control of the\nblood flow based on the concentrations of metabolites is termed metabolic\nregulation. By simultaneous ionotophoretic application (see Appendix Secs.\nB.2.3(b) and B.4.2) of acetylcholine (ACh, an endothelial-dependent va-\nsodilator) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, endothelial-independent), Ste-\nfanovska and Kvernmo and co-authors have shown that the oscillations\naround 0.01 Hz apparently originate from endothelial activity [99, 100,103,\n161,163]. The layer of endothelial cells serves as a barrier between the blood\nand the tissues of vessels, and controls the contraction and relaxation of\nsmooth muscle by releasing various substances. It seems that metabolic\nregulation of the blood flow is mediated by the activity of endothelial cells\nthrough adjustment of the concentrations of various substances. Nitric oxide\n(NO) is one of the most important vasoactive substances. It was reported\nthat the interval V was modulated by the inhibition of NO synthesis of\nendothelium [100], suggesting that this interval is related to NO from en-\ndothelium. An independent study has confirmed that the oscillations in this\ninterval are NO-dependent. [136].\nVI Around 0.007 Hz, apparently corresponding to NO-independent (probably\nprostaglandin-dependent) endothelial activity. This interval was not iden-\ntified in some of the earlier studies, probably because 20-min recordings\nprovided insufficient low frequency resolution and these oscillations were\nfiltered out during data pre-processing. However, a strong peak was later\nobserved around 0.007 Hz [101, 113] and is clearly evident in the present\nwork. It was found that the wavelet amplitude at the corresponding fre-\nquencies differs between healthy subjects and cardiac heart failure patients\nwhen ACh is iontophoretically introduced [163].\nNote that interval I is not shown in Fig. 17. The HRV signals are determined\naccording to R-peaks as explained in section 2.3.1. The interval between se-\nquential R-peaks is usually around 1 s. According to Eq. (19), the sampling\nfrequency of the HRV signal is also around 1 Hz. It means that the HRV sig-\nnals do not have enough sampling points to enable the frequency of interval I\nto be resolved.\nFor the calculations in this section, the scaling s is used from 0.5 to 200 with\na factor 1.05.\n42\nBased on the use of the FFT [164], it was reported that the powers of HF (0.15-\n0.4 Hz) and LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) are significantly lower in elderly subjects than\nin young subjects. Lotric\u02c7 et al. [94] studied the effects of aging on activity by\nusing wavelet transform within the frequency intervals from I to V in Table 1.\nIn the latter investigation, a decrease with age was observed in all the intervals.\nThere were several differences between the earlier study [94] and our present\none: (i) the present measurements allow spectral calculations in intervals II-VI,\ncompared to intervals II-V earlier; (ii) the healthy subject group here is larger\n(iii) the larger numbers now allow us to separate the effect of gender; (iv)\nthe subjects in [94] were all Slovenian, whereas here they are mostly British.\nWe note that Vigo et al. [165] reported a decrease of wavelet power with age,\nalbeit using a different definition of intervals within 0.003\u20130.4 Hz.\nWe now present new data and their analyses. The effects of aging on the\nabsolute energy within each interval except I, are shown in Fig. 18, and those\non relative energy in Fig. 19.\nHere, and in what follows, we take p < 0.05 as indicating statistical significance\n(see Appendix B).\nIt can be seen that total energy decreases significantly with age both for males\n(\u03c1 = \u22120.29, p = 0.02) and females (\u03c1 = \u22120.40, p = 0.01), corresponding to\nsignificant decreases with age in the standard deviation of HRV as shown in\nFig. 3. These decreases of total energy come from the significant decreases in\nabsolute energy in intervals II and III both for males and for females. Absolute\nenergy in interval II decreases significantly with age for both males (\u03c1 = \u22120.48,\np = 0.00) and females (\u03c1 = \u22120.53, p = 0.00); absolute energy in interval III\nalso decreases significantly with age for both males (\u03c1 = \u22120.38, p = 0.00) and\nfemales (\u03c1 = \u22120.43, p = 0.00). Absolute amplitudes in intervals IV, V and VI\ndo not show significant age-related changes.\nThe relative energy in interval VI and V (endothelial) increases significantly\nfor males (VI: \u03c1 = \u22120.24, p = 0.04 and V: \u03c1 = \u22120.31, p = 0.01) and for\nfemales (VI: \u03c1 = \u22120.32, p = 0.03 and V: \u03c1 = \u22120.43, p = 0.00). In interval III\n(myogenic), it decreases significantly for males (\u03c1 = \u22120.23, p = 0.05). Relative\namplitudes decrease in interval II both for males (\u03c1 = \u22120.25, p = 0.04) and\nfor females (\u03c1 = \u22120.43, p = 0.00).\nGender differences were observed in interval II for HRV, and these are summa-\nrized in Table 2. In the younger population below 40 years (p = 0.01) females\nare higher than males in terms of absolute energy, but the two groups are the\nsame in the older population above 55 years (p = 0.02).

But the results indicate that the gender is an\nimportant factor to take into account in studies of HRV.\nNote that there are some differences between these results and those of [94].\nIn particular, we see some evidence for increases with age of the relative en-\nergy in intervals IV,V,VI with corresponding decreases in intervals II, III \u2013\nalthough all trends are not statistically significant. The differences are proba-\nbly attributable to the differences between the studies themselves (see above).\nWe note that Choi et al. [166] reported that ethnicity can affect the power\nof HF and LF. These results indicate that characteristics of subjects such as\ntheir gender, nationality and age should be carefully considered in conducting\nmeasurements and in drawing conclusions from the results.\nGender difference (HRV)\nAbsolute energy Relative energy\nbelow 40 years above 55 years below 40 years above 55 years\nII p = 0.01 (f) p = 0.02 (f) p = 0.05 (f) p = 0.39\naverage (male) 0.07\u00b1 0.06 0.02\u00b1 0.02 0.29\u00b1 0.14 0.25\u00b1 0.20\naverage (female) 0.13\u00b1 0.08 0.06\u00b1 0.06 0.37\u00b1 0.15 0.26\u00b1 0.10\nTable 2\nSignificance of gender differences in interval II of the blood flow wavelet analysis.\nCases where females have significantly higher energy than males are indicated with\nan (f).

B.\nAs outlined in Appendix A.2, the blood circulates around the closed loop pro-\nvided by the vascular system. The cardiac output, determined by the product\nof the heart rate and the stroke volume, amounts to about 5 liters per minute.\nThe oscillations in blood flow propagate from the heart into the microcircula-\ntion. Basal blood flow was recorded on the right wrist and inner right ankle;\nthe iontophoresis chambers for ACh and SNP were positioned a few cm apart\non the volar side of the left arm. One of the blood flow signals is shown in Fig.\nB.4.\nIt is known that ACh induces vasodilation through enhancement of the ac-\ntivity of endothelial cells, but the exact mechanisms are still not fully under-\nstood. The involvement of endothelium in ACh-induced vasodilation is the\n45\nFig. 20.

It was suggested that\nimpaired ACh-induced vasodilation by comparison with SNP-induced vasodi-\nlation could be taken as a demonstration of endothelial dysfunction [167].\nSee more details about the drugs and iontophoresis in Appendix. A.6 and\nAppendix.B.\n4.3.3 Absolute energy\nAll the blood flow signals were resampled from 400 Hz to 10 Hz by aver-\naging 40 points and their lower frequency oscillations below 0.005 Hz were\ndetrended. Then the wavelet analysis was applied to them. The wavelet trans-\nform calculated from the signal measured with ACh shown in Fig. B.4a (see\nAppendix. B) is shown in Fig. 20, and its time-average is shown in Fig. 21.\nThe wavelet transform calculated from the signal measured with SNP shown\nin Fig. B.4b (see Appendix. B) is shown in Fig. 22, and its time-average is\nshown in Fig. 23. These microvascular blood flow signals stimulated by ACh\nand SNP are from the same subject. The six peaks, the physiological origins\nof which have already been discussed in section 4.3.1, were observed. As we\nexplain in Appendix. B, the two vasodilators, ACh and SNP, were applied to\nassess the change in endothelial function with age. The six peaks still exist in\nboth cases, but their strength differs between endothelial-dependent ACh and\nendothelial-independent SNP in several intervals, as shown in these wavelet\nresults. For example, in this case, the peak at the lowest frequency for ACh\nis higher than that for SNP. We again emphasize that we measure the signals\nwith ACh and SNP in close proximity (2-5 cm apart), over similar vascula-\nture, on the same person, simultaneously. Thus the differences come from the\ndifferent actions of the two substances. As discussed above, their influence on\nthe individual oscillatory components has been investigated in many different\nstudies.\n46\nFig. 22.

Time-averaged amplitude\nof blood flow with SNP.\nThe degree of endothelial activity can be assessed from the wavelet energy in\nendothelial-associated intervals. Age-related changes in average flow and total\nenergy are shown in Fig. 24, and the absolute energy of endothelial-related\nintervals in Fig. 25. In fact, average flow does not change with age with either\nACh or SNP. The total amplitude with ACh decreases significantly with age\nfor females. It is because the absolute energy in intervals VI and V decreases\nsignificantly with age only for females. In fact there are significant gender\ndifferences for ACh in intervals VI and V as shown in Table 4. Young females\nhave higher energy in the endothelial related intervals than young males.\nThe differences of absolute energy in intervals VI and V between ACh and\nSNP-influenced signals are summarized in Table 3. For females, the absolute\nenergy with ACh is higher than that with SNP in interval VI in both the\nyounger and aged populations, and the absolute energy with ACh is higher\nthan that with SNP in interval V in the younger population. For males, the\nabsolute energy with ACh is higher than that with SNP in intervals VI and\nV in the younger population.\nWe can conclude that, as they age, humans tend to lose the differences in\nresponse to ACh and SNP in intervals V or VI.\n4.3.4 Relative energy\nWhen we measured blood flow signals, we tried to choose measurement sites\nsuch that the density of vessels would be same for all the subjects. However,\nit was impossible to get exactly the same density because we could not see\nthe microvasculature under the skin, and because every subject has a differ-\nent condition of their skin. For this reason, relative energy was calculated to\nprovide a normalized value in each interval by dividing the absolute energy by\nthe total energy. Relative energy has an important meaning related to DFA\nas explained in subsection 4.4.2.\n47\n20 40 60 80\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nx 104\n\u03c1\nm\n=0.01, p\nm\n=0.94\n\u03c1\nf\n=\u22120.31, p\nf\n=0.03\nTo\nta\nl e\nne\nrg\ny \n(A\nU2\n)\nAge (years)\nc d\n20 40 60 80\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nx 104\n\u03c1\nm\n=0.18, p\nm\n=0.14\n\u03c1\nf\n=0.22, p\nf\n=0.14\nAge (years)\n20 40 60 80\n0\n100\n200\n300 \u03c1m=0.02, pm=0.89\u03c1\nf\n=\u22120.13, p\nf\n=0.39\nAv\ner\nag\ne \nflo\nw \n(A\nU)\nACh\n20 40 60 80\n0\n100\n200\n300 \u03c1m=0.06, pm=0.62\u03c1\nf\n=0.01, p\nf\n=0.93\nSNPa b\nFig. 24.

An important result\nfrom wavelet analysis is thus that there are the differences related to age and\ngender in how the vasculature reacts to these vasodilators.\n4.4 Discussion\nThe observation that the vessel of females tend to react to ACh more than\nto SNP is interesting. It may indicate that, for females, the activities of en-\ndothelium dominate in causing vasodilation. Are these differences related to\nthe fact that females have fewer cardiovascular problems than males?

Cases where the relative energy is\nsignificantly higher with ACh are indicated with an (A).\n4.4.1 Age-related changes in oscillatory components\nA difference between the spectral energies with ACh and SNP was observed\nin intervals VI and V, especially for younger females. It is thought that higher\nenergies in these intervals were produced by the endothelial activities and that\nyoung females have higher endothelial function than younger males and aged\nsubjects. It is well known that younger females have less cardiovascular risk\nthan males and aged females. Our results support the idea that the higher\nendothelial activity which generates the oscillations in interval V and VI leads\nto the healthier cardiovascular function. It may be assumed that the vessels\ntend to lose their elasticity and ability to dilate spontaneously, through the\nendothelial response decreasing with age.\nThe results in the other intervals from I to IV are also important in under-\nstanding how aging affects the blood circulation, but we omit them on account\nGender difference for relative energy\nACh SNP\nbelow 40 years above 55 years below 40 years above 55 years\nInterval VI p = 0.01 (f) p = 0.51 p = 0.19 p = 0.70\nInterval V p = 0.13 p = 0.73 p = 0.54 p = 0.95\nTable 6\nGender difference between the relative energies in intervals VI and V for ACh (left-\nhand side) and SNP-influenced signals (right-hand side).

Rather our present aim is to show how we can make use\nof the wavelet transform, especially for revealing low frequency intervals.\nIn summary, aging brings a decrease of endothelial oscillatory activity in blood\nflow.\n4.4.2 Relationship with complexity analysis\nIt can be seen that HRV signals decrease in amplitude as people get older. The\nreason lies in the decreases in RSA and myogenic effects with increasing age.\nThe decrease in RSA is well known, and our result is in agreement with that\nof the previous study [94]. The ways in which the couplings between cardiac\nand respiratory, and cardiac and myogenic, systems change with age remain\nunknown, however, and further studies are needed.\nNow we discuss the relationship between the results of wavelet analysis of\nHRV, and those of the complexity analysis in the previous section. As we have\nalready discussed, the HRV signals of younger people are more complex than\nthose of aged people. It is to be expected that the signals of young people\nare closer in shape to white noise, whereas those of aged people are closer to\nBrown noise in the time scale from 10 to 50 seconds. To display the differences\nbetween the signals \u2013 white noise, Brown noise, and the HRV of a young and\nan aged person are shown in Fig. 27. In each case the wavelet spectrum was\ncalculated from a 100-second segment and time-averaged. The result for Brown\nnoise looks smoother than for white noise because Brown noise has a higher\nratio of slow oscillations to fast oscillations than white noise. The HRV of the\naged female also looks smoother than that of a young female, for the same\nreason.\nThe range from 10 to 50 seconds, where the exponent \u03b1i increases significantly\nwith age, corresponds to intervals III and IV. It can be assumed that these\naging effects in \u03b1i are attributable to the significant increase with age in\nthe ratio of the wavelet energy in the slower oscillations in interval IV to\n52\nthe wavelet energy in the faster oscillations in interval III: for males (\u03c1 =\n0.38, p = 0.00), and for females (\u03c1 = 0.50, p = 0.00), as shown in Fig. 28a.\nThe age-related changes in \u03b1l cannot be seen in the longer time scales from 50\nto 300 seconds, which correspond to interval V and VI. This could be because\nthe ratio of the wavelet energy of the slower oscillations in interval VI to that\nof the faster oscillations in interval V does not change significantly with age\nfor either males (\u03c1 = 0.02, p = 0.85) or for females (\u03c1 = \u22120.01, p = 0.97), as\nshown in Fig. 28b.\n20 40 60 80\n0\n1\n2\n3 rm=0.38, pm=0.00\nrf=0.50, pf=0.00\nAge (years)\nEn\ng \nIV\n\/II\nI\nHRV\n20 40 60 80\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4 rm=0.02, pm=0.85\nrf=\u22120.01, pf=0.97\nAge (years)\nEn\ng \nVI\n\/V\nHRVa b\nFig. 28.

These include e.g. neurological [169] and mechani-\ncal [170] mechanisms. In the previous section, we discussed one consequence\nof the cardio-respiratory interaction, the modulation of heart rate by the res-\npiratory system, as well as the modulation by other physiological processes.\nIn this section, we will discuss another result of the interaction between the\ncardiac and respiratory systems, cardio-respiratory synchronization. The phe-\nnomenon has been reported in the study of an\u00e6sthetized rats [29], young\nhealthy athletes [27, 28], infants [171], healthy adults [32, 172\u2013174] and heart\ntransplant patients [32]. As discussed in [173, 175], modulation and synchro-\nnization are competing process. In this section, we study the effect of aging\non cardiovascular synchronization and compare it with the results of the other\nsections.\nAs we saw in section 2.1, in the case that oscillators have weak coupling,\nor there is a weak external force, the perturbation influences only phase. It\nmeans that the oscillation can be described by only one variable, the phase.\nWe now discuss phase synchronization under the assumption that the cardio-\nrespiratory interaction is weak enough to be described by phase dynamics.\n53\n5.1 Theory of a pair of coupled oscillators\nIn this section, we discuss the case where two almost identical oscillators in-\nteract with each others weakly. Their dynamics is given by\ndX1\ndt\n=F(X1) + \u03b4F1(X1) +V12(X1,X2), (61)\ndX2\ndt\n=F(X2) + \u03b4F2(X2) +V21(X2,X1). (62)\nWe suppose the dynamics of two oscillators to be closed. Then F(X) is the\ncommon structure for both oscillators and \u03b4F(Xi) is the deviation from F(Xi).\nV21(X1,X2) and V21(X2,X1) represent the interacting term. By this expres-\nsion, the phases of oscillators 1 and 2 can be defined in the same way, based on\nthe dynamics of F(X). As shown in previous subsections 2.1.1, the dynamics\nof the oscillators is\nd\u03c61\ndt\n=\u03c9 + (U\u2217, \u03b4F1(\u03c61) +V12(\u03c61, \u03c62)), (63)\nd\u03c62\ndt\n=\u03c9 + (U\u2217, \u03b4F2(\u03c62) +V21(\u03c62, \u03c61)). (64)\nWe introduce new variables as \u03c61,2 = \u03c9t+\u03c81,2 and, by averaging, the equations\nof \u03c8 are expressed as\nd\u03c81\ndt\n= \u03b4\u03c91 + \u039312(\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82), (65)\nd\u03c82\ndt\n= \u03b4\u03c92 + \u039321(\u03c82 \u2212 \u03c81), (66)\nwhere\n\u03b4\u03c91=\n1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03b8(U\u2217(\u03b8 + \u03c81), \u03b4F1(\u03b8 + \u03c81)), (67)\n\u039312(\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82)= 1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03b8(U\u2217(\u03b8 + \u03c81),V12(\u03b8 + \u03c81, \u03b8 + \u03c82)). (68)\nWhen the interaction is symmetric asV12(X2,X1) = V21(X2,X1) = V(X1,X2),\nit is clear that \u039312(\u03c8) = \u039321(\u03c8) = \u0393(\u03c8). In that case, the dynamics of the dif-\nference of the two phases \u03c8 = \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82 is written as\nd\u03c8\ndt\n= \u03b4\u03c9 + \u0393a(\u03c8), (69)\n54\n\u22122 0 2\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n\u0393\na\n(\u03c8)+\u03b4\u03c9\nmax\n\u0393\na\n(\u03c8)+\u03b4\u03c9\nmini\nd\u03c8\n\/d\nt\n\u03c8\nFig. 29. Plot of d\u03c8\/dt as a function of \u03c8. The two solid curves have a minimum or\nmaximum \u03b4\u03c9 which allows the curves to cross d\u03c8\/dt = 0. The crossing point is the\nvalue where phase-locking occurs. The dashed curve has \u03b4\u03c9 between the minimum\nand maximum. The open circle represents a stable fixed point and the filled circle\nan unstable fixed point.\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9 = \u03b4\u03c91\u2212\u03b4\u03c92 and \u0393a(\u03c8) = \u0393(\u03c8)\u2212\u0393(\u2212\u03c8). Note that \u0393a(0) = \u0393a(pi) =\n\u0393a(\u2212pi) = 0. If \u03c8 is constant, it means that the two oscillators are synchro-\nnized. This synchronization solution \u03c8 = constant corresponds to d\u03c8\/dt = 0\nin the Eq. (69). Therefore whether synchronization occurs depends on whether\nthe right hand side of Eq. (69) has a zero solution and whether the zero so-\nlution is stable or not. From this, it is concluded that synchronization occurs\nif \u03b4\u03c9 is within a range shown as Fig. 29. For example, if the coupling func-\ntion is a simple sine function like \u0393(\u03c8) = \u2212K sin(\u03c8), the condition which the\nfrequency difference has to satisfy is |\u03b4\u03c9\/K| < 1.\nIf phase-locking occurs and \u03c8 = \u03c80 (in other words, if \u03c80 is a stable fixed\npoint), the frequency of both oscillators via entrainment becomes \u03c9 + \u03b4\u03c91 +\n\u0393(\u03c80), which is equal to \u03c9 + \u03b4\u03c92 + \u0393(\u2212\u03c80).\nFor each coupling strength K, there is a range of \u03b4\u03c9 where phase-locking\noccurs. We can calculate the boundaries of this region in the K \u2212 \u03b4\u03c9 plane,\nwhich is called the Arnold tongue.\nIn the case of n:m synchronization, we can carry through a similar discussion\nby thinking in terms of n\u03c81 and m\u03c82.\nIf an oscillator is coupled with many oscillators according to\ndXi\ndt\n= F(Xi) + \u03b4Fi(Xi) +\nN\u2211\nj=1\nVij(Xi,Xj), (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N), (70)\n55\n00\n\u03b4\u03c9 \nK \na\nb\nc\nFig. 30.

It is constructed by plotting the normalized relative\nphase of heartbeats within m respiratory cycles according to the following\nequation,\n\u03c8m(tk) =\n1\n2pi\n\u03c6r(tk) (mod 2pim), (74)\n56\nwhere tk is the time of the k-th marked event in the heartbeat and \u03c6r(tk) is\nthe instantaneous phase of respiration at the time tk. In perfect m:n phase\nlocking, \u03c8m constructs n horizontal strips in the synchrogram. However, in\nreality these strips are broadened because of noise. One synchrogram can\ndetect synchronization for only one value of m. For example if we choose\nm = 2, the synchrogram detects only 2:n synchronization. In order to cover\nall possible synchronization states, we would have to plot synchrograms for all\nvalues of m although it would not be practical in reality.\n5.2.2 Synchronization index\nA synchrogram is one of the ways to see synchronization visually but it is\nnot adequate to quantify the synchronization in the presence of noise. It is\nespecially difficult to judge which ratio of synchronization occurs just by in-\nspecting a set of synchrograms with different m. To overcome this weakness,\nTass et al. introduced synchronization indices in 1998 [176]. There are two\nways to define the synchronization index.\nOne is based on the conditional probability. We have two phases \u03c61(tj) and\n\u03c62(tj) defined on the intervals [0 2pim] and [0 2pin] respectively, where j is\nan index of time. Each interval is divided into N bins. We take a particular\ncentered time tc1 and decide a certain window length around tc1 and call this\ntime interval \u2018interval-1\u2019. We take all j such that tj is within the interval-1.\nThen, for each bin l, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 N , we calculate\nrl(tc) =\n1\nMl\n\u2211\ne\u0131\u03c62(tj)\/n (75)\nfor all j, such that \u03c61(tj) belongs to the bin l and Ml is the number of points\nin this bin. If there is a complete n:m dependence between two phases, then\n|rl(tc1)| = 1, whereas it is zero if there is no dependence. Finally we calculate\nthe average over all bins by application of the following equation,\n\u03b3nm(tc) =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nl=1\n|rl(tc)|. (76)\nThus \u03b3nm measures the conditional probability for \u03c62 to have a given value\nprovided that \u03c61 is in a certain bin at the time tc. Then we move the centered\ntime tc to t\n\u2032\nc and recalculate the index in the same way. In order to find out\nm and n, we need to try different sets of values and select the set that gives\nthe largest index.\n57\nThe other approach is based on entropy. It is defined by\n\u03c1nm =\nSmax \u2212 S\nSmax\n, (77)\nwhere S is the entropy of the distribution of \u03a8m,n = n\u03c61\u2212m\u03c62 (mod 2pi) and\ndefined as\nS = \u2212\nN\u2211\nk=1\npk ln pk, (78)\nwhere pk is the probability that \u03a8m,n is in the bin k. Note that Smax = lnN ,\nwhereN is the number of bins. It is normalized in such a way that 0 \u2264 \u03c1nm \u2264 1,\nwhere \u03c1nm = 0 corresponds to an uniform distribution (no synchronization)\nand \u03c1nm = 1 corresponds to a Dirac delta-like distribution (perfect synchro-\nnization).\n5.3 Application to cardiovascular signals\n5.3.1 Synchronization duration of real data\nIn this section, we determine the synchronization duration of the data that\nwe measured according to the procedures described in Appendix B. We first\nintroduce a method for evaluating the degree of synchronization in order to be\nable to discuss the age-related changes in synchronization. We calculate the\nsynchronization index of 1:n and 2:n for cardio-respiratory synchronization\nfor each subject with the window length 5T for 1:n synchronization and 10T\nfor 2:n synchronization where T is the average respiratory period. The reason\nfor this choice of window length is to see the synchronization during the same\nperiods for all subjects, rather than using a fixed time for them all. If the index\nexceeds 0.95 for a duration longer than 5T for 1:n synchronization, and for\n10T for 2:n synchronization, we judge that synchronization occurred during\nthe interval.\nWhen the signal of one subject is exchanged with the signal of another sub-\nject, or when a signal is randomized, the synchronization index can occasion-\nally reach high values without real cardiovascular coupling. To be sure that\nthe synchronization comes from a genuine cardiovascular interaction, we set\nthese minimum thresholds for synchronization index and duration. The syn-\nchrogram and synchronization index is discussed in Fig. 31 together with a\ndemonstration of how to construct a synchrogram. It can be seen that the\nstate of synchronization changes with time and that the synchronization ratio\nchanges spontaneously from 1:3 to 2:7. This kind of synchronization transition\n58\nis quite common and is seen for all subjects. It is evident that noise disturbs the\nsynchronization and that the synchronization makes frequent transitions from\none state to another. Finally we calculate the total duration of synchroniza-\ntion during which the index was beyond 0.95. The synchronization duration\nis proportional to the ratio of synchronization time to the whole measurement\ntime of 1800 seconds, which was fixed for all subjects. We therefore consider\nthe synchronization duration as equivalent to the percentage of respiratory\nperiods which are in the state of synchronization during the whole measure-\nment period. With this interpretation, differences in the average respiratory\nperiod do not affect the result.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 32. The synchronization duration increases sig-\nnificantly with age for females (\u03c1 = 0.42, p = 0.00), whereas it does not have\nany correlation with age for males (\u03c1 = \u22120.14, p = 0.25). Females have a\nlonger synchronization duration than males in the elderly population above\n55 years (p = 0.00), whereas there is no significant gender difference in the\nyounger population (p = 0.86). These results indicate that beyond the age of\n55 there is a large, significant increase in the mean extent of synchronization\ncompared to the males at all ages and the younger female group.\n5.3.2 The correlation of synchronization duration with HRV and RFV\nWe first examine possible correlation between the synchronization duration\nand the heart and respiratory rates. The results are shown in Fig. 33. The\nlogarithm of the synchronization duration has a significant positive correlation\nwith the average respiratory rate, both for males (\u03c1 = 0.61, p = 0.00) and\nfemales (\u03c1 = 0.54, p = 0.00), and a significant negative correlation with total\nwavelet energy in RFV both for males (\u03c1 = \u22120.41, p = 0.00) and females\n(\u03c1 = \u22120.34, p = 0.03). There are no gender-specific differences between the\nextent of the correlation between these variables. In contrast to the respiratory\nfrequency, the duration of synchronization is independent of the average HR\nor HRV in both males and females. This reinforces the inference that the\nduration of synchronization is strongly linked to the respiratory oscillator.\nThe correlation with average respiratory and synchronization duration could\nbe thought attributable to the algorithm, because the synchronization thresh-\nold is proportional to the average respiratory rate and it is more difficult to\nmaintain the synchronization state over the longer duration criterion. It is dif-\nficult to compare synchronization for people who have significantly different\nrespiratory rates. If we chose a fixed threshold of e.g. 30 seconds, the average\nrespiratory rate will not affect the results, but it would be doubtful whether\nwe could identify the 2:n synchronization reliably for a person whose average\nrespiratory period is more than 7.5 seconds. We need a longer time to judge\nthe synchronization state for the people who have longer average respiratory\n59\n0 300 600 900 1200 1500 1800\n2\n3\n4\nTime (sec)\nH\nR\n\/R\nF\nEC\nG\n596 598 600 602 604 606 608 610\nR\nes\np\nTime (sec)\n2pi\n4pi\n \n2pi\n \n \n4pi\n0.95\n1\n\u03b3\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\nFig. 31.

Indeed for the body it may\nbe more difficult to maintain the stationary state for a longer time. However,\nthese results at least show that a larger standard deviation of respiration (for\nboth genders) leads to increased synchronization duration in the resting state\nfor healthy subjects.\nThe observation that a bigger standard deviation leads to shorter synchroniza-\ntion epochs corresponds well with our picture that, if the frequency fluctuates\ndramatically, the parameters easily move outside the Arnold tongue, thus de-\nstroying the synchronization. The point has also been discussed in the recent\nstudy by Kenwright et al [174].\nAlthough we could not see any significant correlation between age and duration\nof synchronization for males, the duration has a significant correlation with\nthe wavelet total energy of respiration, which is not significantly correlated\nwith age. The total energy of heart rate, which decreases significantly with\nage, does not have significant correlation with synchronization duration. For\nfemales, it is certain that respiration has a significant effect in causing the\nsynchronization. There is a trend for the average RF to increase with age for\nfemales although the correlation is not statistically significant (p = 0.09). This\nmeans that increases in average respiratory rate are matched by corresponding\nincreases in the variability of that RF. There is no correlation between these\nvariables in the male population. Thus the slight trend for increased RF with\nage in the female population, along with stronger relationships between RF\nand RFV in the female population, together with the strong effects of RF\nand RFV on the duration of synchronization, manifest in a highly significant\nlengthening in the epochs of synchronization in older females.\n61\n0.2 0.3\nRF\n0.7 1 1.3\n10\n25\n50\n100\n250\n500\nAverage (Hz)\nHR\n0.02 0.10.1 0.5\n10\n25\n50\n100\n250\n500\nWavelet energy (Hz2)\nSy\nnc\nhr\non\niza\ntio\nn \ndu\nra\ntio\nn \n(se\nc)\na b\nc d\nFig. 33.

The filled\ncircles represent males and the crosses represent females.\n5.3.3 Surrogate data\nThe first point to be settled is whether the synchronization reflects the true\ncardiovascular interaction, or whether it is just noise, i.e. a random fluctua-\ntional phenomenon. This problem was investigated by Toledo et. al. [32] by\nusing surrogate date. In the present study, we created surrogate data from the\noriginal signals and used them to calculate the duration of \u201csynchronization\u201d.\nSurrogate data are artificially generated data that mimic some of the statis-\ntical properties of the data under study, but not the particular property that\nis being tested.\nSurrogate data was methodologically introduced into time series analysis as a\nmethod of testing for nonlinearity [177]. The basic idea is to compute a non-\nlinear statistic for the data under study and to do the same for an ensemble of\nrealizations of surrogates that mimic the linear properties of the studied data.\nIf the computed statistics for the original data is significantly different from\n62\nthat obtained from surrogates, one can infer that the data was not generated\nby a linear process. Otherwise, the null hypothesis that a linear model fully\nexplains the data must be accepted.\nThere are several ways of making surrogate data to meet the needs of studies.\nFor bivariate data, four types were proposed by Palus\u02c7 [178]:\n\u2022 IID1 surrogates are realizations of mutually independent IID (indepen-\ndent identically distributed) stochastic processes (white noise) with the\nsame mean, variance and histogram as the series under study. The IID sur-\nrogates are constructed by scrambling the original signal, i.e. the elements\nof the original series are randomly permutated in temporal order and differ-\nent random permutation are used for the two components of the bivariate\nseries.\n\u2022 IID2 surrogates are realizations of IID stochastic processes (white noises),\nwhich take account of possible cross dependences between the two compo-\nnents of the bivariate series. In each realization, the same random permuta-\ntion is used for both components of the bivariate series. The IID surrogates\npresent the null hypothesis of mutually dependent white noise, i.e. the two\nseries are synchronized in a sense of mutual dependence given, e.g., by cross\ncorrelations; but the specific phenomenon as well as other temporal struc-\ntures are absent.\n\u2022 FT1 surrogates are independently generated for each of the two com-\nponents in the bivariate data as realizations of linear stochastic processes\nwith the same power spectra as those under study. The FT1 surrogates\nare obtained by computing the Fourier transform (FT) of the series; it is\nthen returned to the time domain with unchanged magnitude but with the\nphases randomized. The FT1 surrogates realize the null hypothesis of two\nlinear stochastic processes which asynchronously oscillate with the same\nfrequencies as the original series under study.\n\u2022 FT2 surrogates are realization of a bivariate linear stochastic process that\nmimics individual spectra of the two components of the original bivariate\nseries as well as their cross-spectrum. When constructing the FT2 surro-\ngates, not only the spectra but also the differences between phases of the\nFourier coefficients of the two series for particular frequency bins must be\nkept unchanged. In this case, the same random number must be added to\nthe phases of both coefficients of corresponding frequency bins. The FT2\nsurrogates preserve some of the synchronization, if present in the original\nseries, which can be explained by a bivariate linear stochastic process.\nIn our study, we derived IID1 surrogates from the original cardiac and respira-\ntory signals. The phases of the original signals were determined by the time of\nmarked events according to the Eq. (15). The periods between marked events\nwere permuted randomly. For example, if the time of marked events of an\noriginal signal is [1, 2.5, 3.7, 5], the periods of original signals are [1.5, 1.2, 1.3].\n63\nThen these periods are randomly permuted like e.g. [1.2, 1.3, 1.5] and the time\nof marker events of surrogate is then [1, 2.2, 3.5, 5] and the phases are calcu-\nlated according to Eq. (15). Different ways of randomization were used for\nthe cardiac and respiratory signals. Finally, the index and duration of syn-\nchronization of surrogates were calculated using the same algorithm as for the\noriginal data.\nThe results are shown in the Fig. 34. Surrogate data still have the same ap-\nparent synchronization durations even after being randomized. However, the\nduration does not increase significantly with age (males p = 0.51; females\np = 0.20) and the correlation with age is lower than the results of the original\ntime series for both genders. This implies that the results of original data does\nnot come only from noise.\n20 40 60 80\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nr=\u22120.09, p=0.47\nSy\nnc\n d\nur\nat\nio\nn \n(se\nc)\nAge (years)\nMalea\n20 40 60 80\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nr=0.15, p=0.30\nFemaleb\nFig. 34. The correlation between the total synchronization duration and age for the\nsurrogate data for (a) males and (b) females.\nWe compared the epochs of synchronization of the original time series and the\napparent epochs of synchronization in the surrogate time series for each gen-\nder. The original time series have significantly longer synchronization epochs\nthan the surrogate time series (males p = 0.00; females p = 0.00). This means\nthat the obtained synchronization is real, and not just because of coincidence.\n5.4 The directionality of cardio-respiratory coupling\n5.4.1 Methods\nThe detection of coupling direction has been treated by making use of the\namplitudes of the observables and evaluating their mutual predictability [179,\n180] or mutual nearest neighbours in reconstructed state spaces [181, 182],\nor by information theoretic approaches [37, 183, 184]. In order to determine\nthe predominant direction of any coupling between the heart rate and the\nrespiratory rate of the data which we measured, we based our analysis on the\n64\npermutation information approach described by Bahraminasab et al. [184] and\nby Palus\u02c7 and Stefanovska [37].\nWe first define and discuss briefly the permutation entropy (PE) of a time\nseries. We take X1(ti+1), . . . , X1(ti+n), and then sort n points into an in-\ncreasing order. If X(tj1) > X(tj2) > . . . > X(tjn), j1j2 . . . jn is the or-\ndered type which we get. The possible j1j2 . . . jn is one of n! permutations\n(j1, j2, . . . , jn \u2208 1, . . . , n). We map each n consecutive data points of the\ntime series starting from a different time index i to one of the ordered types\nout of the n! permutations. We represent all the possible ordered types by\npi1, pi2, . . . , pin!. The PE of the time series is then defined as the Shanon en-\ntropy\nH(X) = \u2212\nn!\u2211\nx=1\np(pix) ln(p(pix)), (79)\nwhere p(pix) is the probability distribution of pix. The PE shows the same\nbehaviour for different values of n. Next, we introduce the directionality of\ncoupling using information-theoretic tools. Consider two time series X1(t) and\nX2(t) representing the observations from two possibly coupled systems. The\naverage amount of information, contained in the variablesX2 about the process\nX1, in its future \u03c4 time units ahead is quantified by the mutual information\nI(X2, X1\u03c4 ) = H(X2)+H(X1\u03c4 )\u2212H(X2, X1\u03c4 ), where the entropyH is calculated\nin the PE sense. H(X2, X1\u03c4 ) is called the joint entropy and is expressed as\nH(X2, X1\u03c4 ) = \u2212\nn!\u2211\nx2=1\nn!\u2211\nx1\u03c4=1\np(pix2 , pix1\u03c4 ) ln(p(pix2 , pix1\u03c4 )). (80)\nIf I(X2, X1) > 0, the processes X1 and X2 are not independent. In order to\ninfer the directionality of coupling between the processes X1 and X2 such as\nthe driving influence from X2 and X1, we need to estimate the net informa-\ntion about the \u03c4 future time of the process X1 contained within the process\nX2. We increment vectors of n points of X1 as X1(ti) \u2212 X1(ti+\u03c4 ), X1(ti+1) \u2212\nX1(ti+1+\u03c4 ), . . . , X1(ti+n)\u2212X1(ti+n+\u03c4 ), write these vectors \u2206X1, and map them\nto ordered types pi\u2206x1 out of n! permutations for every possible time in-\ndex i. How much system 2 drives the system 1 is measured by the con-\nditional mutual information I21 = I(X2,\u2206X1|X1) of the variables X2 and\n\u2206X1 given the variable X1 which is expressed as I21 = I(X2,\u2206X1|X1) =\nH(X2|X1) + H(\u2206X1|X1) \u2212 H(X2,\u2206X1|X1), where the conditional entropy\nH(X2|X1) is expressed as\nH(X2|X1) = \u2212\nn!\u2211\nx2=1\nn!\u2211\nx1=1\np(pix2 , pix1) ln(p(pix2|pix1)), (81)\n65\nand\nH(X2,\u2206X1|X1)=\u2212\nn!\u2211\nx1=1\nn!\u2211\n\u2206x1=1\nn!\u2211\nx2=1\np(pix1 , pi\u2206x1 , pix2)\n\u00d7 ln(p(pix2 , pi\u2206x1|pix1)). (82)\nIf I21 = 0, there is no information in X2 about the \u03c4 future time of the\nprocess X1, but if I21 > 0, there is some information in X2. In the same way,\nI21 = I(X1,\u2206X2|X2) is calculated. Directionality of coupling from 1 to 2 can\nbe written as\nD12 =\nI12 \u2212 I21\nI12 + I21\n. (83)\nThere is also another way to calculate the conditional mutual information I21\naccording to Palus\u02c7 and Stefanovska [37]. We define \u2206\u03c4X1,2 as\n\u2206\u03c4X1,2 = X1,2(t+ \u03c4)\u2212X1,2(t). (84)\nThe conditional mutual information is written in the same way as above, I21 =\nI(X2,\u2206\u03c4X1|X1) = H(X2|X1) + H(\u2206\u03c4X1|X1) \u2212 H(X2,\u2206\u03c4X1|X1), which is\nobtained by a simple box counting algorithm based on equiprobable marginal\nbins (marginal equiquantization [185]).\nIn our study, X1(t) represents the phase of the heart and X2(t) represents the\nphase of the respiration which was reconstructed with a sampling frequency of\n10 Hz. We took \u03c4 = 5, 6, . . . , 50 for both PE and equiquantal methods, which\nmeans the delay was from 0.5 to 5 seconds. For each \u03c4 , we express mutual\ninformation as I12(\u03c4). After getting 46 values of I12(\u03c4) and I21(\u03c4) under the\nparameter of n = 4 for the PE method and 8 bins for the equiquantal method,\nwe took the averages over the values and obtained the final values of I12 and\nI21 for each subject for each method as\ni(X2 \u2192 X1) = 1\nN\n\u03c4max\u2211\n\u03c4=\u03c4min\nI12(\u03c4), (85)\nwhere N = 46, \u03c4min = 5 and \u03c4max = 50 in our case. We refer to this i as\nthe intensity of influence. For the results presented below in the next section,\nwe write the intensity calculated by the PE method as iPerm and intensity\ncalculated by the equiquantal method as iEqq.\n100 sets of randomized surrogate data sets were analysed in the same way\nby each method, and the average of 100 surrogate data was taken for each\nsubject.\n66\n5.4.2 Results\nThe evidence discussed above shows that the RF exerts a strong influence on\nthe extent of synchronisation. This would suggest that the respiratory system\nis the driving force in the coupling between these two oscillators. Confirmation\nof this inference was achieved using the permutation information approach to\nobtain information about the directionality of the coupling.\nThe intensity of influence is much stronger from respiration to heart than in\nthe opposite direction, for both genders, and from both methods as shown in\nFigs. 35 and 36.\nAn age-related decline in the effect of respiration on cardiac activity for males\nis found by both methods (Figs. 35a and 36a), whereas there are no age-related\nchanges in the effect of cardiac activity on respiration (Fig. 35c and Fig. 36c).\nFor females, there is a trend towards a decline with age for the intensities in\nboth directions, as found by both methods, but there is a difference between\nthe two methods in the calculated significance (cf. Figs. 35b and 36b, and cf.\nFigs. 35d and 36d). But since the p-value of the effect of respiration on cardiac\nactivity by the equiquantal method is close to the borderline (Fig. 36b), it\ncould be claimed that there is a decline with age for female as well.\nThe intensity of influence in both directions is significantly larger for females,\nas compared to males, when calculated by the PE method (p < 0.01 from\nrespiration to heart and p = 0.01 from heart to respiration), whereas these\ngender differences were not found to be statistically significant by the equi-\nquantal method.\nThe decline with age of the intensity of influence from respiration to heart\ncalculated by the PE method is much more pronounced in males than in\nfemales (Fig. 35a and b). Thus in females the respiratory system has much\nmore influence on the cardiac system, compared to males and the effects of\naging compound this difference as the i values in females decline at a slower\nrate compared to the male population. Since this effect was not observed by the\nequiquantal method, it requires confirmation (or refutation) through further,\nmore detailed, studies of the numerical properties of the two methods.\nThis possible strong influence of the respiratory system, linked with the trends\nin respiratory rate and respiratory rate variability in the female population, to-\ngether lead to significant age-related increases in the extent of synchronization\nbetween these two oscillators in the female population. There is no age-related\nchange in the extent of synchronization in the male population.\nSince these time series are non-stationary, it is to be expected that the in-\ntensities of influence will fluctuate with time. We also calculated the time-\ndependent intensity by dividing each signal into ten 3-min windows, which\n67\nwas the minimum length required to obtain reliable results. Then we counted\nthe length of time when the intensity of influence from the real data was\nlarger than that from the surrogate data for each subject, and plotted these\ntime lengths as a function of age. The results were quite similar to those of\nintensity calculated from whole signals (Fig. 35 and Fig. 36).\n20 40 60 80\n0   \n0.02\n0.04\n\u03c1=\u22120.42, p=0.00\nIn\nte\nns\nity\niPerm R\u2212>H (Male)\n20 40 60 80\n0    \n0.005\n0.01 \n\u03c1=\u22120.05, p=0.71\nAge (years)\nIn\nte\nns\nity\niPerm H\u2212>R (Male)c\n20 40 60 80\n0   \n0.02\n0.04\n\u03c1=\u22120.25, p=0.09\niPerm R\u2212>H (Female)\n20 40 60 80\n0    \n0.005\n0.01 \n\u03c1=\u22120.08, p=0.59\nAge (years)\niPerm H\u2212>R (Female)\na b\nd\nFig. 35.

Their coupling arises through both\nmechanical interactions and also through co-ordinated neurological control\nmechanisms as part of the overall homeostasis of the whole organism. The\nphysical manifestations of this coupling have been extensively studied in the\ncontext of frequency modulation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia -RSA) between\nthe two systems and, more recently, synchronization (frequency and phase co-\n68\n20 40 60 80\n0  \n0.1\n0.2\n\u03c1=\u22120.34, p=0.00\niEqq R\u2212>H (Male)\nIn\nte\nns\nity\n20 40 60 80\n0   \n0.05\n0.1 \n\u03c1=0.01, p=0.91\nAge (years)\niEqq H\u2212>R (Male)\nIn\nte\nns\nity\nc d\n20 40 60 80\n0  \n0.1\n0.2\n\u03c1=\u22120.50, p=0.00\niEqq R\u2212>H (Female)\n20 40 60 80\n0   \n0.05\n0.1 \n\u03c1=\u22120.21, p=0.15\nAge (years)\niEqq H\u2212>R (Female)\na b\nFig. 36.

The evolution of new\nmethodologies in nonlinear dynamics has facilitated the detection of phase\nsynchronization between the two biological oscillators, and these methods have\nbeen used to study synchronization in the examples already mentioned above\n\u2013 in athletes, in adult and infant sleep patterns and in an\u00e6sthesia [27, 28, 63,\n171,186].\nWe noted that the synchronization ratio is not constant but changes with\ntime. This is because the ratio of HR and RF fluctuates with time as shown\nin Fig. 31h. It seems to be non-stationary, like the heart rate and respiratory\nrate. The synchronization ratio is not restricted to 1:n but may also be 2:n.\nThere is the possibility that the ratio is m:n where m is more than three.\nHowever, it is usually difficult to detect synchronization with higherm because\nit requires a longer window for calculation and the noise component become\nmore significant.\nWe now discuss these issues in more detail.\n69\n5.5.1 Is cardio-respiratory synchronization dependent on respiratory rate and\nits variability?\nWe have used nonlinear methods to assess the relative importance of the\ntwo oscillatory systems in allowing synchronization to be achieved. Our data\ndemonstrate that the respiratory rate and variations are strongly related to\nthe duration of synchronization that is observed over the 30 min measurement\nperiod. Further analysis of the directionality of coupling between the cardiac\nand respiratory oscillators also demonstrates that the respiratory system is\nthe major influence with no detectable effect of the cardiac system. Our stud-\nies on synchronization link to studies of another interaction between the two\nsystems, namely RSA \u2013 the modulation of heart rate by the frequency of res-\npiration. Models of RSA, including the idea of a \u2019respiratory gate\u2019 point to the\nimportance of the respiratory rate in the modulation of cardiac rhythms [187].\nIn our case, looking at synchronization and coupling between the systems, the\nrespiratory rate is again identified as important. Added to this we have now\ndemonstrated that RF and the extent of the variability in RF are also impor-\ntant factors.\n5.5.2 Gender specific differences in age related changes in cardio-respiratory\nsynchronization.\nThere are strong gender-specific differences in the coupling of the respiratory\nand cardiac oscillators. The duration of synchronization is independent of age\nin males, but the extent of synchronization is significantly higher in older\nfemales compared to younger females or males of any age. This effect is not\nassociated with noise, as assessment of the surrogate data set does not result\nin any association between these two variables. Thus in healthy resting females\nthe extent of synchronization between the cardiac system and the respiratory\nsystem increases as they get older and is particularly evident in the over 55\nyears.\n5.5.3 Gender based differences in the aging process\nGender-specific effects of aging on the human body have been studied at many\nlevels, ranging from the assessment of the length of teleomeres at the end of\nchromosomes through to whole system studies as described here. One inter-\nesting feature arising from the teleomere studies is that for any \u201dbiological\nage\u2019 the telomere lengths are shorter in males compared to females suggesting\nthat the aging process advances faster in the male population [188]. Demo-\ngraphic data (with the life expectancy of females being longer than males)\nand studies of other aging processes including cardiovascular, renal and res-\npiratory systems show the same phenomena [189]. We find that the extent\n70\nof synchronization in males is independent of age across the whole age-span\nso the changes observed in the female population are not merely a manifes-\ntation of a general delay in the aging process compared to the males. Many\ndifferences between the aging processes in males and females are linked to the\nbeneficial effects of estrogens. In post-menopausal women these benefits are\nlost such that eventually the aging process in females in their ninth and tenth\ndecade, catches up with the aging process in their male counterparts. On this\nbasis we would expect that the synchronization patterns for females would\ntend to converge to the male data. In fact the opposite is true; the gender dif-\nferences between the duration of synchronization are enhanced in later years,\nnot reduced.\n5.5.4 Are the gender based differences linked to changes in the HR or HRV?\nWhat are the origins of this increase in synchronization? In terms of the in-\ndividual oscillators, the variability in both the heart rate and the respiratory\nfrequency are independent of age in both males and females (as shown in\nFig. 3). In agreement with previously published data, the spectral energy (a\nmeasure which is proportional to the standard deviation) of the HRV is sig-\nnificantly negatively-correlated with age [7, 39, 120, 190]. This effect can be\nvisualized by consideration of Fig. 18, although the actual average HR does\nnot change, the extent of variability on either side of the line denoting the av-\nerage value is decreased. This manifestation of the aging process is probably\nlinked to a decrease in the plasticity of the heart with aging. This decline is\npresent in both the male and female populations and the extent of this de-\ncline is not significantly different between the male and female subjects. This\nsuggests that the increase in the extent of synchronization in females is not\nassociated with alterations in HRV. Previous studies also revealed that the\nstandard deviation of the heart rate is negatively correlated with the time-\naveraged synchronization index [6] but the gender of the subjects used in this\nlatter study was not identified.\n5.5.5 Are the gender based differences linked to changes in RF or RFV?\nIn contrast to the results for HR and HRV in females, the origin of the alter-\nations in the extent of synchronization are to be found in the overriding rela-\ntionship between the duration of synchronization, RF and RFV. There were\nno significant relationships between aging and RF or RFV in either males or\nfemales, but within the female population there was a trend towards increased\nRFV with age. Also in females the average RF is significantly correlated with\nits own variability. Another factor in the extent of synchronization observed\nbetween these two oscillatory systems is the directionality of the coupling\nbetween them. In both males and females the directionality is from the respi-\n71\nratory system to the cardiac system and this direction does not change with\nage. What does change however is the extent of the influence (intensity) that\nrespiration has on HR. As subjects become older, the influence declines, but\nthe starting level is higher in females and the rate of decline is much lower\n(as gauged by the PE method). Thus in females RF has more influence on\nthe HR than in males. Taken together, all of these effects result in stronger\nsynchronization in the cardio-respiratory systems of older females.\n5.5.6 Synchronization in other physiological states\nAlternative explanations for the increased duration of synchronization come\nfrom other studies looking at duration of synchronization in different phys-\niological settings. In an\u00e6sthetized rats, longer synchronization duration was\nobserved (with the concomitant decrease in the standard deviation of respira-\ntory frequency) [29]. Similarly, in non-REM sleep the extent of synchronization\nwas increased whilst in REM sleep the extent of synchronization was decreased\ncompared to wakefulness [186]. Longer synchronization times have also been\nlinked to the better physiological condition of athletes as compared to non-\nathletes [27]. However, it has been shown that synchronization is reduced, or\nalmost destroyed during the exercise itself [174]. In general, the greater the\nmodulation of HRV, especially by the low frequency components, the less syn-\nchronization occurs. Based on the an\u00e6sthesia and sleep studies it appears that\ndecreased input from neurological control mechanisms leads to enhanced syn-\nchronization. In terms of the directionality of this coupling, our observation of\nsignificant coupling from respiration to cardiac activity is in agreement with\nseveral earlier studies [36, 37, 174, 184]. In babies the coupling is symmetri-\ncal just after birth but, within six months, the influence from respiration to\nthe cardiac rhythm becomes dominant [191] as observed in our, and other,\nadult-based studies.\n5.6 Conclusion\nWe conclude that, in resting subjects, there are gender-based differences in the\nextent to which the respiratory system is able to \u201cdrive\u201d the cardiac system,\nwith females displaying much higher levels of coupling and directionality. The\nincreased synchronization seen in older females may result from the maintained\nstrength of coupling between these two systems compared to males, along with\nthe tendency for the RF of females to increase with age. In summary the data\nprovide definitive information about the central importance of the respiratory\noscillator in the synchronization between itself and the cardiac oscillator in\nthe resting state. The duration of the synchronization observed increases as\nthe average RF increases, and is inversely correlated with the variability in\n72\nthe respiratory rate. There are many studies of HRV, its links to autonomic\ncontrol and potential use as a diagnostic tool (see for example, [92, 192]). We\nconclude, however, that RF and RFV are also critical indicators of the cardio-\nrespiratory interaction, and that future studies should consider them in more\ndetail.\nThere are significant gender-specific differences in how the extent of synchro-\nnization varies with age. These differences are not significantly associated with\nchanges in the individual oscillators but alterations in the average RF and the\ngender based differences in the extent of coupling are at least partially involved\nin the increased synchronization observed in older females.\n6 Conclusion\nSome of the physiological processes associated with aging have been illumi-\nnated by the application of methods drawn from statistical physics and non-\nlinear dynamics to the analysis of cardiovascular time series.\nTwo approaches to the analysis of cardiovascular signals have been presented,\nbased respectively on coupled oscillators and statistical mechanics. The obser-\nvation of cardio-respiratory synchronization demonstrates a well-known prop-\nerty of nonlinear coupled oscillators (Sec. 5). These results illustrate the fact\nthat the cardiovascular system may be represented by a set of coupled oscil-\nlators of relatively few degrees of freedom. At the same time, however, the\nsystem is always exposed to noise from unpredictable sources bringing many\nadditional degrees of freedom. In this sense, the statistical approach, reviewed\nin Sec. 3, is useful: although DFA is usually regarded as a way of obtaining\na scaling for a system with many degrees of freedom, we showed that there\nis a close connection between DFA results and the oscillatory components\ndetected by wavelet analysis. Scaling properties, and their connections with\ncoupled oscillator models with relatively few degrees of freedom (but in the\npresence of noise), clearly deserve further investigation.\nOur main conclusions are \u2013\n(1) The standard deviation of heart rate decreases significantly with age for\nboth males and females. The new results presented above are consistent\nwith previous studies [7, 38,39,41,120].\n(2) The total energy of HRV decreases with age because the contributions to\nvariability attributable to respiratory activity (energy interval II) and to\nmyogenic activity (interval III), decrease with age. Significant decreases\nwith age in both the total energy, and the energy in intervals II and\nIII, were observed in [7]. We found no significant age-related change in\n73\nthe recently identified interval VI. Neither did we observe the significant\ndecreases in intervals III and IV that were reported in [7]; the difference\nmay be associated with the smaller number of subjects in the latter study.\nIt is reported for the first time that females have stronger RSA than males\nin the younger population.\n(3) The complexity of HRV within the range of 10 to 50 seconds decreases sig-\nnificantly with age. The decrease arises because the ratio of the energy in\nthe slower oscillations of interval IV (neurogenic activities) over the faster\noscillations of interval III (myogenic activities) increases significantly with\nage. It indicates that the neurogenic control of HR becomes more promi-\nnent than myogenic control with increasing age. Decreases with age of\ncomplexity in HRV were reported in earlier studies such as [44, 49]. The\ndifference between the present review and the latter work is the window\nsize used for the calculations. Our window size was determined by the\ntime scales selected by wavelet analysis. Thus we could identify for the\nfirst time the physiological reasons underlying the decrease of complexity\nwith age.\n(4) In this way, the connection was established between complexity analy-\nsis and the analysis of oscillatory dynamics. The time-scales detected by\nwavelet analysis help to determine the window size for complexity anal-\nysis, and enable us to interpret the results of the complexity analysis.\n(5) The responses of young females to the endothelial-related vasodilator\nACh are significantly higher than those of young males and aged females,\nwhereas there is no significant gender or aging-related difference for SNP.\nIt was already known that there is a decrease in endothelial-dependent va-\nsodilation with age and gender difference by using iontophoresis-stimulated\nblood flow measurements [47,48,106,107]. Our application of the wavelet\ntransform to such signals has revealed age- and gender-related changes\nin the oscillatory dynamics for the first time. It indicates that the en-\ndothelial function of females is higher than that of males, which may\nbe connected with the well-known fact that young females have lower\ncardiovascular risk compared with aged females and males.\n(6) The duration of cardio-respiratory synchronization epochs increases sig-\nnificantly with age for females. The logarithm of the synchronization\nduration has a significant correlation with the average respiratory rate\nand total energy of respiration for both males and females. In addi-\ntion, respiratory rates affect the synchronization duration exponentially.\nEarlier studies have reported synchronization under a range of different\nconditions, e.g. an\u00e6sthetized rats [29], young healthy athletes [27,28], in-\nfants [171], healthy adults [32,172\u2013174] and heart transplant patients [32].\nThe present review is the first to draw attention to the effects of aging\non synchronization and to the strong correlation between the duration of\nsynchronization and the respiratory rate.\nFrom all these results, we conclude that aging is a significant factor affecting\n74\ncardiovascular dynamics in healthy individuals, and that gender sometimes\nproduces a significant difference as well. We note that, with use of a larger\nsubject cohort to improve the statistics, the approaches discussed here could in\nprinciple be used to create a basis for quantifying a subject\u2019s \u201ccardiovascular\nage\u201d. This could be a useful parameter for clinical purposes, for planning and\nfor optimisation of quality of life, especially as the measurements concerned\nare relatively brief, noninvasive and involve no discomfort.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are very grateful for valuable discussions with Alireza Bahraminasab, An-\ndriy Bandrivskyy, Alan Bernjak, Peter Clarkson, David Kenwright, Bojan\nMusizza, Jane Owen-Lynch, Milan Palus\u02c7 and Janko Petrovc\u02c7ic\u02c7.

Physiological background\nIn this appendix we provide a succinct summary of the relevant physiological\nbackground needed by non-biological scientists to study the review.\nA.1 Electrical activity in the cell\nFirst, we describe briefly the electrical activity in a single cell, thus providing\nthe basic information for the subsequent sections.\nThe predominant solutes in the extracellular fluid are sodium and chloride\nions. The intracellular fluid also contains high concentrations of potassium ions\nand ionized non-diffusible molecules, particularly proteins, with negatively\ncharged side chains and phosphate compounds. Electrical phenomena result\nfrom the distribution of these charged particles and occur at the cell plasma\nmembrane.\nAll cells under resting conditions have a potential difference across their plasma\nmembranes. The inside is negatively charged with respect to the outside. This\npotential difference is known as the membrane resting potential.\nBy convention, the extracellular fluid is assigned a voltage zero, and the po-\nlarity of the membrane potential is stated in terms of the sign of the excess\ncharge inside the cell. The magnitude of the resting potential lies in the range\nbetween -5 and -100 mV, depending on the type of cell. The resting potential\nis steady unless a movement of charged particles occurs between the inside\nand the outside. The distribution of charged particles inside and outside the\ncell is shown schematically in Fig. A.1.\nTransient changes in the membrane potential from its resting level produce\nelectrical signals. These signals occur in two forms, graded potentials and\naction potentials. Graded potentials are important in producing signals that\npropagate over short distances whereas action potentials propagate over long\ndistances. Graded potentials arise in all cells, but action potential do not. The\nlatter needs some specific function in the membrane. Here we refer only to the\naction potential because it bears on the following sections.\nBefore proceeding further, we note that the resting membrane potential also\nfluctuates in all cells. However, these fluctuations are meaningful only in vivo\n\u2013 when a cell is surrounded by other cells and the flow of ions is continuous\n\u2013 whereas the present understanding of the electric properties of membranes\ncomes from in vitro studies. We can further hypothesize that the fluctuations in\nquestion are most probably related to the fluctuations in endothelial activity,\n76\nC e l l\nE x t r a c e l l u l a r\nf l u i d++ +\n++\n+\n+\n+\n++++++++\n++\n+\n+ + + + + +\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n++\n+ +\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +\n++\n_\n_ _\n__\n__\n____\n__________ _\n_ _\n__\n_\n_ _ _ _ _\n_\n_ _\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\nFig. A.1. Schematic diagram showing the distribution of charged particles inside\nand outside the cell membrane.\nand may perhaps be involved in the endothelial-related oscillations discussed\nearlier. This possible relationship remains to be explored and elaborated in\nfuture research.\nThe terms depolarize, repolarize, and hyperpolarize are used to describe the\ndirection of changes in the membrane potential relative to the resting potential\n(Fig. A.2). The membrane is said to be depolarized when its potential is less\nnegative than that of the resting state. Overshoot is a reversal of the membrane\npotential polarity. When a membrane potential that has been depolarized\nreturns toward the resting value, it is said to be repolarizing. The membrane\nis hyperpolarized when the inside potential is more negative than the resting\nlevel.\nr e s t i n g  p o t e n t i a l\nm e m b r a n e\np o t e n t i a l\n( m V ) 0\n- 7 0\nD e p o l a r i z i n g\nO v e r s h o o t\nR e p o l a r i z i n g\nH y p e r d e p o l a r i z i n g\nFig. A.2.

Changes in the membrane potential when an action potential is generated.\nA.2 The circulatory system\nThe heart, the vascular system (blood vessels) and the blood are the three\nprinciple components that make up the circulatory system. As reported by\nthe British physiologist William Harvey in 1628, the cardiovascular system\nforms a closed loop, so that blood pumped out of the heart through one set\nof vessels returns to the heart via a different set. The whole system can be\ndivided into two circuits, the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circula-\ntion (Fig. A.4b). Each of them starts and ends in the heart. The right and left\nsides of the heart each has two chambers: the upper chamber is the atrium and\nthe lower one is the ventricle. There is flow from the atrium to the ventricle\non each side of the heart but there is no direct flow between the two atria or\ntwo ventricles.\nThe pulmonary circulation causes blood to be pumped from the right ventricle\nthrough the lungs and thence to the left atrium. It is then pumped through\nthe systemic circulation from the left ventricle, through all the organs and\ntissues of the body except the lungs, and thus to the right atrium. In both\ncircuits, the vessels which carry blood away from the heart are called arteries\nand those which carry blood towards the heart are called veins.\nIn the systemic circuits, blood leaves the left ventricle via a single large artery,\nthe aorta (Fig. A.4a). The arteries of the systemic circulation branch off the\naorta, dividing into smaller vessels. The smallest arteries branch into arterioles,\nwhich branch into a huge number of very small vessels, the capillaries. The\ncapillaries then unite to form vessels of larger diameter, the venules and then\nveins. The flow in arterioles, capillaries and venules is termed microcirculation.\nIn the pulmonary system, blood leaves the right ventricle via a single large\nartery, the pulmonary trunk, which divides into two pulmonary arteries, one\n78\nsupplying the right lung and the other the left. In the lungs, the arteries\ncontinue to branch and form the capillaries that unite into venules and then\nveins. The blood leaves the lungs via four pulmonary veins, which empty into\nthe left atrium.\nAs blood flows through the lung capillaries, it picks up oxygen supplied to\nthe lungs by breathing. So the blood in the pulmonary veins, the left side of\nthe heart, and the systemic arteries has a higher oxygen content. Correspond-\ningly, the blood in the other side of the circulatory system has a lower oxygen\ncontent.\nBecause of the crucial role of the lungs in supplying the oxygen that is then\ntransported by the circulatory system, the lungs can be viewed as a fourth\ncomponent of the cardiovascular system. The pressure difference that they\nprovide is also important, especially for the venous return, and the lungs can\ntherefore be seen as a second pump, in addition to the heart, within the\ncardiovascular system.\nA.3 The heart\nA.3.1 Anatomy\nThe heart is a muscular organ enclosed in a fibrous sac, the pericardium, and\nlocated in the chest. The walls of the heart are composed primarily of cardiac\nmuscle cells and are termed the myocardium. The inner surfaces of the cardiac\nchambers, as well as the inner walls of the blood vessels, are lined by a thin\nlayer of cells known as endothelium.\nLocated between the atrium and ventricle in each half of the heart are the atri-\noventricular (AV) valves, which permit blood to flow from atrium to ventricle,\nbut not from ventricle to atrium (Fig. A.4a).\nThe opening and closing of the AV valves is a passive process resulting from\npressure difference across the valves. When the blood pressure in an atrium\nis greater than in the corresponding ventricle, the valve is pushed open and\nblood flows from atrium to ventricle. In contrast, when a contracting ventricle\nachieves an internal pressure greater than that in its connected atrium, the\nAV valve between them is forced to close.\nThe openings of the right ventricle into the pulmonary trunk, and of the left\nventricle into the aorta, also contain valves, the pulmonary and aortic valves,\nrespectively (Fig. A.4a). These valves permit blood to flow into the arteries\nduring ventricular contraction but prevent blood from moving in the opposite\ndirection during ventricular relaxation. They also act in a passive way like\n79\n v e n t r i c l e\nL e f t\na t r i u m\na t r i u m\n v e n t r i c l e\nR i g h t\nR i g h t\nL e f t\nL u n g s\nP u l m o n a r y\nc i r c u l a t i o n\nS y s t e m i c\nc i r c u l a t i o n\nA l l  o r g a n s  a n d  t i s s u e\no t h e r  t h a n  l u n g s\nP u l m o n a r y  \n v e i n sP u l m o n a r ya r t e r i e s\nS y s t e m i c  \na r t e r i e s\nS y s t e m i c  \n v e i n s\nL e f t\nv e n t r i c l e\nR i g h t\nv e n t r i c l e\nL e f t\na t r i u m\nR i g h t\na t r i u m\nA o r t aS u p e r i o r\nv e n a  c a v a\nI n f e r i o r\nv e n a  c a v a\nP u l m o n a r y  \na r t e r y\nP u l m o n a r y  \n   v e i n\nA o r t i c  \n v a l v e\nP u l m o n a r y  \nv a l v e\nL e f t\nA V  v a l v e\n   R i g h t\nA V  v a l v e\nP u l m o n a r y  \nt r u n k\na\nb\nFig. A.4.

(b) Schematic\ndiagram showing the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\n80\nthe AV valves, and they are either open or closed depending on the pressure\ndifferences across them.\nA.3.2 Heartbeat coordination\nThe heart is a dual pump in that the left and right sides of the heart pump\nblood separately but simultaneously. The atria contract first, followed almost\nimmediately by the ventricles. Contraction of cardiac muscle is triggered by\ndepolarization of the plasma membrane. The gap junctions that connect my-\nocardial cells allow the action potential to spread from one cell to another.\nThus, the excitation of one cardiac cell results in the excitation of all the\ncardiac cells. This initial depolarization normally arises in a small group of\ncells, the sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium near the entrance\nof the superior vena cava (Fig. A.5). The action potential spreads from the SA\nnode throughout the atria and then throughout the ventricles. So the SA node\nworks as the pacemaker for the entire heart, and its discharge rate determines\nthe heart rate, the number of times the heart contracts per minute.\nThe action potential initiated in the SA node spreads throughout the right\natrium, and from the right atrium to the left atrium, so rapidly that the two\natria contract at the same time.\nThe spread of the action potential to the ventricles involves the rest of the\nconducting system, a portion of which is called the atrioventricular (AV) node.\nThe AV node is located at the base of the right atrium (Fig. A.5). The action\npotential spreading through the right atrium causes depolarization of the AV\nnode. Because the propagation of the action potential through the AV node\nis relatively slow, atrial contraction is completed before ventricular excitation\noccurs.\nAfter leaving the AV node, the impulse enters the interventricular septum\nbetween ventricles. This pathway has conducting-system fibres termed the\nbundle of His (Fig. A.5). The AV node and the bundle of His constitute the\nonly electrical link between the atria and ventricles.\nWithin the interventricular septum the bundle of His divides into right and left\nbundle branches, which leave the septum to enter the walls of both ventricles\n(Fig. A.5). These fibres contact with Purkinje fibres, large conducting cells\nthat rapidly distribute the impulse throughout much of the ventricles. Finally\nthe Purkinje fibres make contact with ventricular myocardial cells, by which\nthe impulse spreads through the rest of the ventricles.\n81\nS i n o a t r i a l  \nn o d e\nA t r i o v e n t r i c u l a r\n n o d e B u n d l e  o f  H i s\nL e f t  \nb u n d l e  \nb r a n c h\nR i g h t\nb u n d l e\nb r a n c h\nP u r k i n j e  f i b e r s\nFig. A.5. Conducting system of the heart.\nA.3.3 Mechanical event of the cardiac cycle\nThe cardiac cycle is divided into two major phases, both named to reflect\nevents that occur in the ventricles. The period of ventricular contraction and\nblood ejection is called systole, and it alternates with a period of ventricular\nrelaxation and blood filling, diastole. On average, one cardiac cycle lasts ap-\nproximately 1.0 second, with 0.4 seconds in ventricular systole and 0.6 seconds\nin ventricular diastole.\nBoth systole and diastole can be subdivided into two periods. During the first\npart of the systole, the ventricles are contracting but all the valves in the\nheart are closed and no blood can be ejected. This period is termed isovolu-\nmetric ventricular contraction because the ventricular volume is constant. The\nventricular walls are developing tension and squeezing the blood they enclose.\nOnce the rising blood pressure in the ventricles exceeds that in the aorta and\npulmonary trunk, the aortic and pulmonary valves open, and the ventricular\nejection period, systole, occurs.\nDuring the first part of diastole, the ventricles begin to relax and the aortic\nand pulmonary valves close, as do the AV valves too. No blood is entering\nand leaving the ventricles and the ventricular volume is not changing. This\nperiod is therefore called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation. The AV valves\nthen open and ventricular filling occurs as blood flows in from the atria. Atrial\ncontraction occurs at the end of diastole after most of the ventricular filling\nhas taken place.\n82\nA.3.4 Control of the heart rate\nThe isolated heart, disconnected from the nervous system beats approximately\nat a rate of 100 beats\/min. The heart rate in the body may be much lower\nor higher than this; the SA node is usually under the influence of nerves and\nhormones. A large number of parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres end on\nthe SA node. Activity of the parasympathetic nerves causes the heart rate to\ndecrease whereas that of sympathetic nerves causes the heart rate to increase.\nIn the resting state, there is considerably more parasympathetic activity to the\nheart than sympathetic, so the normal resting heart rate of about 60 beats\/min\nis well below the inherent rate of 100 beats\/min.\nA.4 The vascular system\nThe functional and structural characteristics of the blood vessels change with\nsuccessive branching. But there is one structural component in common in the\nentire cardiovascular system. It is a smooth single-celled layer of endothelial\ncells or endothelium, which lines the inner surface of the vessels. Capillaries\nconsist only of endothelium, whereas all other vessels have additional layers\nof connective tissue and smooth muscle.\nA.4.1 Endothelium\nThe endothelium is located at the interface between the blood and the vessel\nwall. The cells are in close contact and form a layer that prevents blood cell\ninteraction with the vessel wall as blood moves through the vessel lumen. The\nendothelium consists of simple squamous epithelium that lines the lumen of\nall blood vessels. It plays a critical role in the mechanics of blood flow, the\nregulation of coagulation, leukocyte adhesion, and vascular smooth muscle cell\ngrowth, and it also serves as a barrier to the transvascular diffusion of liquids\nand solutes.\nIt was first reported by Furchgott and Zawadzki in 1980 that the intact en-\ndothelium produces a factor which causes relaxation of vascular smooth mus-\ncle. This was originally named endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF); it\nis now known to be nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is released continuously by\nendothelium in the arterioles and contributes to arteriolar vasodilation in the\nbasal state. The production of NO can be stimulated by a variety of endothelial\nantagonists, including acetycholine, as well as by shear stress resulting from\nan increase of blood flow or pressure. In addition to NO, the endothelium\nreleases other vasodilators such as prostacyclin (PGI2) and vasoconstrictors\nsuch as endothelin-1 (ET-1) [193].\n83\nFig. A.6.

This figure is taken from [193].\nA.4.2 Vascular smooth muscle\nThe smooth muscle cells are arranged in helical or circular layers around the\nlarger blood vessels and in a single layer around arterioles. Vascular muscle\ncells provide active tension in the vessel wall and regulate the diameter of the\nvessels.\nIn many vessels there are smooth muscles that undergo spontaneous depo-\nlarization. There cells act as pacemakers and excite neighboring cells, thus\nproviding background tension, the myogenic basal tone. Their activities are\nindependent of innervation. The property is similar to that of the heart, but\nthe contractile characteristics and the mechanisms that cause contraction of\nvascular smooth muscle are very different from those for cardiac muscle. Vas-\ncular smooth muscle undergoes slow, sustained, tonic contractions, whereas\ncardiac muscle contractions are rapid and of relatively short duration (a few\nhundred milliseconds).\nContraction in vascular smooth muscle can be initiated by mechanical, elec-\ntrical, or chemical stimuli. Passive stretching of vascular smooth muscle can\n84\ncause contraction that originates from the smooth muscle itself and is therefore\ntermed a myogenic response. Electrical depolarization of the vascular muscle\ncell membrane also elicits contraction, most likely by opening voltage depen-\ndent calcium channels and causing an increase in the intracellular concentra-\ntion of calcium. Finally, a number of chemical stimuli such as norepinephrine,\nangiotensin II, vasopressin, endothelin-1 can cause contraction. Each of these\nsubstances bind to specific receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cell (or\nto receptors on the endothelium), which then leads to vascular smooth muscle\ncontraction.\nA.5 The nervous system\nA.5.1 Innervation of the heart\nThere are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system which affect the\nheart\u2019s activities, the parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic\nnervous system.\nParasympathetic innervation is achieved by the two vagus systems. The right\nvagus affects the SA node predominantly. This nerve has an ability to slow SA\nnodal firing and even stop it for several seconds. The left vagus nerve mainly\ninhibits AV conducting tissues. The sympathetic nerve supply is nearly uni-\nformly distributed in the heart. Increased sympathetic activity produces an\nincrease in the heart rate and velocity and force of contraction. Parasympa-\nthetic nerves predominate in healthy, resting individuals. After a parasympa-\nthetic blockage, the heart rate increases substantially and after sympathetic\nblockade, it decreases slightly. After a blockade of both divisions, the heart\nrate is about 100 beats per minute for young adults.\nA.5.2 Innervation of the vessels\nMost of the arteries and veins are innervated by the sympathetic nervous\nsystem. The fibres have a tonic contractile effect on the blood vessels.\nA.6 Vasodilatory substances\nIn this section, details of the substances, ACh and SNP, are described.\n85\nA.6.1 Acetylcholine\nAcetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that is released from the terminals\nof parasympathetic and motor nerves. It serves as a transmitter of nervous\nstimulation through synapses. Its chemical formula is CH3COOCH2CH2N\n+(CH3)3.\nWhen it binds to the acetylcholine receptors of striated muscle fibres, it stimu-\nlates those fibres to contract. ACh is also released and used in the brain, where\nit tends to cause excitatory actions. The glands that receive impulses from the\nparasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system are also stimulated in\nthe same way. This is why an increase in ACh causes a decreased heart rate\nand increased production of saliva.\nAcetylcholine was first identified in 1914 by Henry Hallett Dale, then confirmed\nas a neurotransmitter by Otto Loewi in 1921. For their work, they received\nthe 1936 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nLater it was found out in experiments on rabbits that the removal of endothe-\nlium prevented ACh-induced vasodilation [98].\nA.6.2 Sodium Nitroprusside\nSodium nitroprusside (SNP) breaks down in the blood and releases nitric\noxide (NO). The nitric oxide enters the muscle cells in the walls of the blood\nvessels and causes them to relax. When the muscles relax, the blood vessels\nbecome wider and the blood pressure decreases. The chemical formula of SNP\nis Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]2.\nSNP is used for the emergency treatment of high blood pressure (hypertensive\ncrisis). It is also used to produce controlled hypotension (low blood pressure)\nin an\u00e6sthetized patients during surgery. It had been used in the emergency\ntreatment of severe heart failure to reduce heart workload. However, it has\nside effects and is no longer used for clinical treatment of hypertension.\nB Appendix B. Physiological measurements\nB.1 Measurement time\nIn living systems, there are several rhythmic processes with different time\nscales. For example, seasonal growth and involution has the time scale around\nyears, reproduction typically takes months in higher organisms, the sleep-\nwakefulness cycle is about 24-hours, the smooth muscle tone around hours,\n86\nblood distribution of order one minute, respiration and heart beat approxi-\nmately seconds, and nervous action in tenths of seconds [194]. The measure-\nment time should be considerably longer than the timescale of the phenomenon\nin which we are interested. In the work reviewed, interest centres on phenom-\nena which occur on the scale of the blood distribution time. Under steady\nconditions in resting subjects, the volume of blood pumped by the heart in\none minute is on average equivalent to the whole amount of blood in the or-\nganism [195]. Thus, the dynamics of the blood distribution can be analyzed\non a time scale of minutes. We are especially interested in oscillations whose\nfrequencies lie in the range 0.005 to 2.0 Hz, i.e. of period 0.5\u2013200 seconds.\nTheir physiological origins have been described in section 4.3.1.\nIf a signal is perfectly periodic, one period is enough to specify it. However,\nsignals from the human cardiovascular system are not periodic, but quasiperi-\nodic, and their periods fluctuate constantly. Consequently, the measurement\nshould be long enough to contain at least several periods. On the other hand,\nthe longer a signal is, the more pronounced the effects of non-stationarity be-\ncome. For example, changes of physiological conditions, or physical movement,\ncan occur during measurements. In our own measurements we chose 30 min\nas a compromise that would still allow us to study the slowest oscillations of\ninterest (interval VI), with a period of \u223c200 s.\nB.2 Measurement techniques\nB.2.1 ECG\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) is a tool for evaluating the electrical events in\nthe heart. ECG measurements have been used for diagnostic purposes for more\nthan a century. The action potentials of cardiac muscle cells can be viewed as\nbatteries that cause charge to move throughout the body fluids. These moving\ncharges are caused by all the action potentials occurring simultaneously in\nmany individual myocardial cells, and their result can be detected by recording\nelectrodes on the surface of the skin. The ECG does not provide a direct record\nof the changes in membrane potential across individual muscle cells. Rather, it\nis a measure of the currents generated in the extracellular fluid by the changes\noccurring simultaneously in many cardiac cells.\nA conventional 3-lead measurement of the ECG is performed by using three\nleads, placed on the right and left shoulder bones for the first and second\nleads, and on the left leg or lower left rib bone for the third lead.\nThe P-wave is the first deflection and represents the electrical impulse through\nthe atrial musculature (depolarization). The second deflection is the QRS com-\nplex and represents the spread of the electrical impulse through the ventricular\n87\nmusculature, which triggers the ventricular contraction. The P-R interval is\nmeasured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS com-\nplex. It reflects the time taken by impulse to travel the entire distance from\nthe SA node to the ventricular muscle. The final deflection is the T wave and\nrepresents the period of recovery for the ventricles (i.e. repolarization).\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\n0\n+ 1\nP o t e n t i a l\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nA V  v a l v e s\nA o r t i c  a n d  p u l m o n a r y  \nv a l v e s\no p e n o p e n\no p e nc l o s e d\nc l o s e d\nc l o s e d\nS y s t o l e D i a s t o l e\nFig. B.1. Schematic diagram showing the structure of the ECG cycle and the timing\nof the associated events occurring in the heart.\nB.2.2 Respiration\nRespiration results in a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide be-\ntween the organism and its external environment. In humans, the respiratory\nsystem includes the oral and nasal cavities, the lungs, the series of tubes lead-\ning to the lungs, and the chest structures which move the air into and out of\nthe lungs. In respiration, there are two movements: inspiration and expiration.\nInspiration is the movement of air from the external environment into lungs,\nenlarging their volume. Expiration is movement in the opposite direction. One\ncycle of respiration consists of an inspiration and an expiration. In our own\nrecordings, respiration was measured by a belt around the thorax to detect the\nchange of the volume of the lungs (Respiratory effort transducer TP-TSD201,\nBIOPAC Systems, Inc. Goleta, CA, USA).\nB.2.3 Blood flow\n(a) Laser Doppler flowmetery\nAfter the first laser was demonstrated by Maiman [196], Cummins et al. pro-\nposed a way of measuring the velocity of particles in solution by using the\nDoppler frequency-shift of back-scattered light [197]. After some years, Riva et\nal. applied this technique to the measurement of the velocity of red blood cells\n88\nin a glass-tube flow model [198] and Stern used the laser Doppler technique\nfor blood perfusion measurement in the undisturbed microcirculation [199].\nThe laser Doppler technique measures blood flow in the very small blood\nvessels of the microvasculature, such as the low-speed flows associated with\nnutritional blood flow in capillaries close to the skin surface and flow in the\nunderlying arterioles and venules involved in regulation of skin temperature.\nThe tissue thickness sampled is typically 1 mm, the capillary diameters 10 mi-\ncrons and the velocity spectrum measurement typically 0.01 to 10 mm\/s. The\ntechnique depends on the Doppler principle by which low power light from\na monochromatic (single wavelength) stable laser is scattered by moving red\nblood cells and, as a consequence, has its frequency broadened. The frequency-\nbroadened light, together with laser light scattered from static tissue, is pho-\ntodetected and the resulting photocurrent processed to provide a blood flow\nmeasurement. Thus there are two optical fibres in laser Doppler probes. One\nis to deliver light to the tissues and the other is to collect the scattered light.\nBonner and Nossal showed that after filtering the scattered light, they could\nobtain an output that was proportional to the velocity and the number of red\nblood cells in the measured volume, but which was unrelated to the direction\nof movement of the red blood cells [200].\nThe corresponding instruments for blood flow measurement were developed\nby Watkins and Holloway [201], Nilsson et al. [202] and Fischer et al. [203].\nThey demonstrated a good correlation between the output of the devices and\nthe blood flow.\nIn our study, based on a Moor Instruments (Axminster) DT4 instrument, a\nnear-infra-red laser of wavelength 785 nm is used to measure the velocity and\nconcentration of red blood cells within the volume covered by the laser light.\nThe size of the probed volume depends on several factors: the optical density\nof the tissue, the separation of the probe fibres, and the power and wavelength\nof the laser. From imaging at this wavelength with the DRT4, it is known that\nthe full dermal thickness (about 1 mm) is probed, so from simple geometry a\nhemisphere of radius 1mm gives a volume of approximately 2 mm3.\nBecause there is a residual value called the biological zero, even in the case\nof complete occlusion [5], we cannot use absolute unite (e.g. ml\/s\/mm3) but\nare obliged to work in arbitrary units (AU) for the flow. The residual value\ncomes from the Brownian motion of the red blood cells. To obtain an abso-\nlute measure, the biological zero is determined by doing probe calibration in\nwater containing a colloidal suspension of polystyrene microspheres of known\ncharacteristics.\n(b) Iontophoresis\nIontophoresis is widely used for transcutaneous delivery of ionized drugs for\n89\nT r a n s m i t t e r R e c e i v e r\nFig. B.2. Sketch showing how a laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe detects flow.\nthe assessment of skin microvascular function. A small electrical current is\nused to transfer locally vasoactive substances such as endothelial-dependent\nACh and endothelial-independent SNP across the dermal barrier as unipolar\ncurrents of relatively large molecules. It has been shown [204] that the potential\ndifference applied does not in itself cause a significant increase in blood flow.\nAs discussed in subsection A.6.2, SNP breaks down to yield nitric oxide (NO),\nwhich acts directly on vascular smooth muscle cells, while ACh acts on the\nintact vascular endothelium causing it to release NO. Endothelial activity\ncan therefore be assessed by looking at the difference between ACh and SNP-\nstimulated oscillations. In this way oscillation around 0.01 Hz and 0.07 Hz were\nshown to be endothelial-dependent [99\u2013101,103]. ACh and SNP are relatively\nhigh conductivity solutions and have opposite polarity. Therefore we need to\napply anodal iontophoresis to ACh and cathodal iontophoresis to SNP.\nHowever, there are some potential methodological problems related to ion-\ntophoresis. It is known that blood flow can sometimes be increased in respond\nto the current itself, in the absence of vasoactive drugs but just with pharma-\ncologically neutral electrolytes such as H2O [205, 206] or NaCl solution [207].\nThis phenomenon is known as the galvanic effect, or current-induced vasodila-\ntion. The mechanism is unclear but could involve, for example, local heating\ndue to the voltage required to convey the ions through the dermal barrier. It\nwas shown in [113] that the magnitude of voltage between the adjacent cham-\nbers needed to sustain the chosen iontophoresis current is not an important\nfactor in causing changes in blood flow using H2O and NaCl. In another earlier\nstudy [208] H2O and NaCl were used with exactly the same protocol as that\ndescribed in this review, with both anodal and cathodal iontophoresis. The\nresults indicated that the differing responses of the 0.01 Hz spectral compo-\nnent to ACh and SNP may be interpreted with confidence as a specific effect\nof the substances, and not of the iontophoresis current itself.\nCurrents were delivered from a battery-powered constant-current iontophore-\n90\nsis controller (Moor Instruments MIC1-e). The iontophoresis probehholders\nwere of perspex with internal platinum wire electrodes. Their internal diame-\nter was 8 mm, giving an area of 1 cm2 in contact with the skin. The dosages of\nthe drugs delivered are proportional to the total charge (Q) in millicoulombs\n(mC) which migrates through skin surface, determined by the product of con-\nstant current measured in milliamperes (mA) and the duration (t) of current\nflow in seconds. We used a protocol that passes a charge of 2 mC (100 \u00b5A for\n20 seconds) followed by a 240 seconds interval seven times in one measurement,\nthus filling the 30 min of recording.\nB.2.4 Measurement set up\nThe measurement of two blood flow channels with ACh and SNP was obtained\nby laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) with a commercially available instrument\n(DRT4, Moor Instruments, Axminster, Devon, UK). A battery powered con-\nstant current source for iontophoresis was connected to the DRT4 and the\nprobeholders for ACh and SNP. The two iontophoresis chambers combined\nwith laser Doppler MP1 probes were positioned on the anterior side of the left\nforearm on adjacent sites under which the vessel densities were similar. A 1 %\nsolution of electrolyte was placed in each chamber.\nThe measurement of basal blood flow was obtained with two additional probes\n(MoorLAB server and MoorLAB satellite, Moor Instruments, Axminster, De-\nvon, UK). They were fixed on the right wrist and on the inner right ankle\nrespectively.\nThe cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter of 22.5 kHz and a time constant of\n0.1 s were selected, thus allowing the dynamics of the slow oscillatory processes\nto be captured.\nThe ECG was set up as described in subsection B.2.1. The ECG and respira-\ntion signals were amplified by a signal conditioning unit (Cardiosignals, Stefan\nInstitute, Ljubljana, Slovenia). All signals were sampled at 400 Hz by a 16-bit\nA\/D converter (National Instruments) and stored in a personal computer.\nB.3 Subjects\nIn the course of data recording, 118 healthy individuals were measured, in-\ncluding 71 males (42.6\u00b1 15.1 years, range 16-74 years) and 47 females (45.8\u00b1\n16.6 years, range 18-82 years). They were not taking any medication nor did\nthey have any history of cardiovascular disease prior to the recordings. They\nwere asked to refrain from eating or drinking coffee for one hour before the\nmeasurements.\n91\nSubjects lay on a bed in a supine position and were asked to relax while\nperipheral blood flow, ECG and respiration were recorded throughout 30 min.\nThe measurements were done at room temperature 22\u00b1 1 \u25e6C during daytime.\nB.4 Recorded signals\nB.4.1 ECG and respiration\n600 601 602 603 604\n0\n2\n4\nEC\nG\nTime (sec)\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\na\n600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609\n3.44\n3.48\n3.52\nR\nes\npi\nra\ntio\nn\nTime (sec)\nb\nFig. B.3.

Statistics\nPhysiological signals taken from different subjects usually have variance in\ntheir characteristics. It is of course inevitable, because there are many possible\nunknown factors which could be responsible for individual differences. In order\nto judge the trend of signals, a careful application of statistics is needed. In\nthis Appendix, we explain in detail the statistical methods that have been\nused in the main part of the review.\nStandard tests have been used to determine the statistical significance of the\nobservations. When the underlying distribution of the data was known, or\ncould be assessed, a parametric test was conducted, e.g. a t-test [209]. It can\nbe used to determine whether two Gaussian populations have different distri-\nbutions in their statistics. On the other hand, when the underlying distribu-\ntion of data was unknown, a non-parametric test was conducted: we used the\nWilcoxon rank sum test [210] to test the difference between the distributions\nof the two groups. We calculated linear regression, correlation coefficients, and\ntheir significance, using MatLab (MatWorks). The level of statistical signifi-\n93\ncance was usually set to 0.05, as is conventional.\nWith an assumption about the underlying distribution of the data, a para-\nmetric test can be conducted. For example, the t-test is a typical parametric\ntest [209]. It is used to test whether two Gaussian populations have different\nstatistical distributions. On the other hand, when the underlying distribution\nof data is unknown, a non-parametric test should be conducted. In our stud-\nies, we use non-parametric tests, the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Spearman\u2019s\nrank correlation coefficient, because we have no prior knowledge of the dis-\ntribution of samples. In section C.1, the details of the significance tests are\nexplained. Correlation analysis is used to draw inferences about the strength\nof the relationship between two or more variables. In section C.2, the details\nof correlation analysis will be explained.\nC.1 Significance tests\nA conjecture concerning the unknown distribution of a random variable is\ncalled a statistical hypothesis. The aim of a significance test is to establish\nwhether the hypothesis is true or not. If the probability that the hypothesis\nholds is below the threshold chosen for statistical significance, the hypothesis\nis rejected. The statistical significance is usually set to 0.05 and the same value\nwas used in this review. Again, the statistical significance tests were conducted\nusing MatLab (MatWorks).\nC.1.1 The t-test\nIn this subsection, a typical parametric test, the t-test, is explained briefly.\nThe t-statistics method was introduced by William Sealy Gosset for cheaply\nmonitoring the quality of stout. Gosset published his t-test in Biometrika in\n1908, but was forced to use a pen name, \u201cStudent\u201d, by his employer who\nregarded the fact that they were using statistics as a trade secret.\nGiven two data sets X1 and X2, each characterized by its mean X\u00af1 and X\u00af2,\nstandard deviation s1 and s2 and number of data points n1 and n2, we can use\na t-test to determine whether the means are distinct under the assumption\nthat the underlying distributions can be assumed to be normal. All such tests\nare usually called Student\u2019s t-tests. Strictly speaking that name should only\nbe used if the variances of the two populations are also assumed to be equal.\nThe test used when this assumption is dropped is sometimes called Welch\u2019s\nt-test. There are different versions of the t-test depending on whether the two\nsamples are independent of each other (e.g., individuals randomly assigned\ninto two groups), or paired so that each member of one sample has a unique\nrelationship with a particular member of the other sample (e.g. the same\n94\nsubjects measured before and after an intervention, or IQ test scores of a\nhusband and wife).\nIn the case that two samples are independent, the t-value is calculated as\nt =\nX\u00af1 \u2212 X\u00af2\nsX1\u2212X2\n, where sX1\u2212X2 =\n\u221a\n(n1 \u2212 1)s12 + (n2 \u2212 1)s22\nn1 + n2 \u2212 2\n(\n1\nn1\n+\n1\nn2\n)\n.(C.1)\nOnce a t-value is determined, a p-value can be found using a table of values\nfrom the t-distribution with (n1+n2\u22122) degrees of freedom. The t-distribution\nfT is a symmetric bell-shaped distribution with heavier tails than the normal\ndistribution. The t-distribution is defined as\nfT (t) =\n\u0393((k + 1)\/2)\u221a\nkpi\u0393(k\/2)\n(1 + t2\/k)\u2212(k+1)\/2, (C.2)\nwhere k is the degree of freedom. The p-value is calculated as\np = 2\n\u221e\u222b\nt\nfT (t)dt. (C.3)\nIf the p-value is below the threshold chosen for statistical significance (usually\n0.05), then the null hypothesis H0 that the distributions of the two groups\nare identical is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis, which typically\nstates that the groups do differ.\nThe t-test is also used to examine whether the slope of a regression line differs\nsignificantly from 0.\nC.1.2 Rank sum test\nRank sum tests form a large category of non-parametric tests [144]. The gen-\neral idea is that, instead of using original observed data, we list the data in\nascending order and assign a rank to each item, the position where the item\nappears in the sorted list. Using the ranks instead of the original observed\ndata makes the test much less sensitive to outliers and noise than parametric\ntests.\nDepending on the number of classes in the data sets, there are different kinds\nof rank sum tests. The Wilcoxon rank sum test [210] is a non-parametric al-\nternative to the t-test. Here we focus on the Wilcoxon rank sum test and\ndemonstrate how to conduct it by taking an example. Let us take two groups\n95\nX and Y. X contains 11 samples and Y contains 7 samples as shown in Ta-\nble C.1. We want to test whether the null hypothesis H0 that the distribution\nof samples X is identical to that of samples Y is true or false.\nTypes Number Values\nX 11 33 14 12 11 22 28 10 8 18 19 20\nY 7 17 28 15 35 27 32 29\nTable C.1\nValues of two groups, considered as an example.\nWe combine all the samples of X and Y and sort them into ascending order.\nRanks are then assigned to the samples based on their order. If k samples have\nthe same rank of i, than all k samples have an average rank i+(k\u2212 1)\/2. The\nresults of the example are shown in Table C.2\nValues 8 10 11 12 14 15 17 18 19\nTypes X X X X X Y Y X X\nRanks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nValues 20 22 27 28 28 29 32 33 35\nTypes X X Y X Y Y Y X Y\nRanks 10 11 12 13.5 13.5 15 16 17 18\nTable C.2\nThe ranks assigned to each sample.\nSuppose that n1 and n2 are the numbers of the smaller sample size and the\nlarger sample size, respectively. In this example, n1 = 7 and n2=11. Then\nwe calculate the sum of group Y and have the statistic W = 6 + 7 + 12 +\n13.5 + 15 + 16 + 18 = 87.5. If the null hypothesis H0 holds, the statistic W\nshould be around the expectation value (n1 + n2 + 1) \u00d7 n1\/2 = 66.5. If W\nis too small or too large, the null hypothesis H0 is likely to be false. Using\nMatLab, the p-value is calculated as p = 0.0589 for this example. If we set\nthe statistical significance to 0.05, the null hypothesis H0 cannot be rejected\nbecause 0.05 < 0.0589, whereas if we set the statistical significance to 0.1, the\nnull hypothesis H0 is rejected.\nWe used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to assess the differences between different\ngenders, different age groups and different drugs.\nC.1.3 Walde-Wolfowitz runs test\nThe WaldWolfowitz test is a non-parametric statistical test to check the hy-\npothesis that the elements of a two-valued data sequence are mutually indepen-\n96\ndent. A \u201crun\u201d is the maximal non-empty segment of the sequence consisting of\nthe adjacent same elements. For example, the sequence +\u2212\u2212++\u2212+++\u2212\u2212\nconsists of six runs, three of which consist of +s and the others of \u2212s. Let us\nsuppose that the number of runs is R, the total number of observation is N ,\nN+ is for occurrences of + and N\u2212 is for occurrences of (N = N+ +N\u2212). In\nthe above example, R is 6, N is 11, N+ is 6 and N\u2212is 5. Then the mean \u00b5 and\nstandard deviation \u03c3 of the probability at which R is obtained given N+ and\nN\u2212 is calculated as\n\u00b5(R) = 1 +\n2N+N\u2212\nN\n(C.4)\n\u03c3(R) =\n2N+N\u2212(2N+N\u2212 \u2212N)\nN2(N \u2212 1) . (C.5)\nWhen N is relatively large (N > 20), the distribution of R is approximately\nnormal. If there are much more or less runs than expected, the hypothesis of\nstatistical independence of the elements may be rejected. Runs tests can be\nused to test:\n(1) The randomness of a distribution, by taking the data in the given order\nand marking with + the data greater than the median, and with the\ndata less than the median; (Numbers equalling the median are omitted.)\n(2) Whether a function fits well to a data set, by marking the data exceeding\nthe function value with + and the other data with -. For this use, the\nruns test, which takes into account the signs.\nWe conducted the runs test by using MatLab, which returns values of h and\np. This is a test of the null hypothesis that the +s and \u2212s come in random\norder, against the alternative that they do not. The test returns the logical\nvalue h = 1 if it rejects the null hypothesis at the 5 % significance level, and\nh = 0 if it cannot. The p-value is computed from either the test statistics or\nthe exact distribution of the number of runs and if p is below the significant\nlevel (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected.\nC.2 Correlation analysis\nC.2.1 Linear correlation\nSuppose that we have n observations of two variables, X = x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn and\nY = y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn. The variation of variable Y can be separated into two parts:\nthe variation associated with variable X and the variation not associated with\nvariable X. The fraction that is explained by a linear relationship between\n97\nX and Y is called the coefficient of determination and its square root is the\ncorrelation coefficient. The correlation coefficient r can be expressed [211] as\nr =\n\u2211n\ni=1 xiyi \u2212 1n(\n\u2211n\ni=1 xi)(\n\u2211n\ni=1 yi)\u221a\u2211n\ni=1 x\n2\ni \u2212 1n(\n\u2211n\ni=1 xi)\n2\n\u221a\u2211n\ni=1 y\n2\ni \u2212 1n(\n\u2211n\ni=1 yi)\n2\n. (C.6)\nThe estimated correlation coefficient r is a random variable that has a distri-\nbution function. The distribution of r is a function of the sample size n and\nthe real correlation coefficient \u03c1. A correlation coefficient of zero means that\nthere is no linear relationship between the two variables. To test whether two\nvariables are linearly related, we set the null hypothesis,\nH0 : \u03c1 = 0. (C.7)\nIt can be shown that for n > 2, this hypothesis can be tested using a t-test\nthat is given by\ntr = r\n\u221a\nn\u2212 2\n1\u2212 r2 . (C.8)\nThe value tr is a random value with a t-distribution that has n\u2212 2 degrees of\nfreedom. The p-value is defined as\np = 2\n\u221e\u222b\ntr\nfT (t)dt. (C.9)\nIf the p-value is lower than statistical significance, then the null hypothesis is\nrejected and the correlation coefficient is considered statistically significant.\nIt is important to check the relationship between variables graphically before\nperforming the correlation analysis in order to check whether there might\nbe an outlier in the data. In the t-test, an outlier can affect the statistics\nsignificantly. In some cases, variables have a nonlinear relationship and this\ncan be identified graphically as well. It was reported by Anscombe [212] that\nseveral different patterns, one of which had a linear relationship and some of\nwhich did not, could return the same correlation coefficient. Nonlinearity may\nresult in low correlation and may sometimes be improved by using a log-plot.\nC.2.2 Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient or Spearman\u2019s rho, named after Charles\nSpearman and often denoted by the Greek letter \u03c1, or sometimes as rs, is a\n98\nnon-parametric measure of correlation - that is, it assesses how well an ar-\nbitrary monotonic function could describe the relationship between two vari-\nables, without making any other assumptions about the particular nature of\nthe relationship between them. It is unaffected by outliers.\nSuppose that Xi and Yi are two variables between which we want to find the\ncorrelation and xi and yi are the rankings of Xi and Yi respectively.\n\u03c1 = 1\u2212 6\n\u2211\ndi\n2\nn(n2 \u2212 1) , (C.10)\nwhere di is the difference between the two variable, xi \u2212 yi.\nIn order to assess the significance level of \u03c1, we shuffled one variable and\nobtained \u03c1 from the permutated data. We repeated this process 105 times and\ncalculated the probability of the \u03c1 of the shuffling data being larger than that\nof the real data. We represented this probability as p and used this value as\nan indicator of the significance level.\nIn plotting the relationships of two variables in the main part of the review,\nwe present \u03c1 and p in each figure. If \u03c1 is positive, there is positive correlation\nand, if \u03c1 is negative, there is negative correlation. However, we do not plot\nlinear regression because we do not assume a linear relationship (unlike the\ncases of the Pearson correlation coefficient).\nThroughout this review, we used Spearman\u2019s rank test to calculate corre-\nlations with age, and their significance, based on the utilization of MatLab\n(MatWorks). We used \u03c1m and pm to represent correlation with age and prob-\nability for males, respectively, \u03c1f and pf for females. The blue lines and dots\nrepresent males, and the red lines and dots females in the various graphs.\nReferences\n[1] J. Penaz, J. Roukenz and H.
