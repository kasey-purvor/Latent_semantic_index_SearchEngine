Specifically, it considers how zooarchaeological evidence \ncan be employed to investigate later-medieval and post-medieval \u2018improvements\u2019 in \nanimal husbandry. Previous studies of animal bone assemblages have indicated that \nthe size of many domestic species in England increases from the 15th century - an \nobservation that has been used to support the writings of those historians that have \nargued that the Agricultural Revolution occurred several centuries prior to the \ntraditionally ascribed date of 1760-1840. Here, zooarchaeological data are presented \nwhich suggest that the size of cattle, sheep, pig and domestic fowl were increasing \nfrom as early as the 14th century. However, it is argued that the description of these \nchanges as revolutionary is misleading and disguises the interplay of factors that \ninfluenced agricultural practice in the post-Black Death period. This paper concludes \nwith a plea for greater awareness of the value of collecting and analysing faunal data \nfrom the 18th and 19th centuries to enable the historically-attested productivity \nincreases of the traditionally dated Agricultural Revolution to be examined \narchaeologically. \n \nKey words \nZooarchaeology, improvement, Agricultural Revolution, animal husbandry, England \n \n 2\nIntroduction \n \nUnderstanding \u2018improvement\u2019 in agriculture has been a central element of historical \nstudies of the feudal\/capitalist transition.  The British Agricultural Revolution, in \nparticular, has engendered a massive amount of debate in the literature, concerning its \nnature, timing, and even existence (see below). The principal focus of historical \nstudies in this topic has tended to be land management and crop husbandry, partly \nreflecting the unsuitability of livestock data.  As Albarella (1997), Davis (1997) and \nDavis and Beckett (1999) have demonstrated, however, archaeological animal bone \nassemblages have the potential to investigate this issue, since they enable long-term \nchanges in animal husbandry to be charted.  \n \nIn this paper, a review of previous historical and zooarchaeological debates \nconcerning the nature of and timing of the Agricultural Revolution is outlined.  This is \nfollowed by the presentation of faunal evidence from two recently studied sites, which \nchallenge current perceptions of the nature of improvements in animal husbandry in \nlater medieval and post-medieval England. These data provide the opportunity to re-\nconsider the conceptual validity of the Agricultural Revolution.  \n \nHistoriography of the \u2018Agricultural Revolution\u2019 \n \nThe Agricultural Revolution has long been described as a widespread technological \nchange in British farming practice that facilitated a sustainable increase in agricultural \nproductivity.  From the early 20th century until the 1960s there was little doubt in the \n 3\nminds of historians that this occurred between about 1760 and 1840 in a movement \nintimately associated with the Industrial Revolution (e.g. Ernle 1912; Beckett 1990, \n1).  This was a phenomenon that enabled the farming community to feed a population \nthat had grown by c.20 million in this period (Kerridge 1967; Mingay 1969; Turner et \nal. 2001, 211).  Some of the traditional features perceived to have led to this increase \nin productivity included: \n? parliamentary enclosure of land; \n? introduction of new farming technology (e.g. the seed drill); \n? new crops and crop rotations; \n? improvement in livestock breeding (Beckett 1990, ix; Overton 1984, 119).   \nThese developments were viewed by historians as being largely facilitated by a small \nnumber of key innovators.  Robert Bakewell, for example, became famed for \nselectively breeding and improving domestic animals in Leicestershire; his \u2018New \nLeicester\u2019 breed of sheep fattened quicker and had a greater proportion of saleable \nmeat, and his \u2018New Longhorn\u2019 cattle carried a larger amount of fat (Beckett 1990, 24-\n25). \n \nWhile Marc Bloch recognised, as early as 1931, that the term \u2018Agricultural \nRevolution\u2019 was the consequence of a \u201cslow process lasting from the late Middle \nAges to the eighteenth century\u201d (Bloch 1931, cited in Verhulst 1990, 17), it was not \nuntil the 1960s that many of Lord Ernle\u2019s ideas, and the evidence upon which they \nwere based, were more convincingly challenged; Eric Kerridge was perhaps the most \ninfluential opponent in this regard. Kerridge (1967) forcefully argued that many of the \ninnovations or practices that were viewed as constituting an 18th-century revolution \n 4\nin agriculture, did not occur at all, were insignificant, or occurred much earlier \n(Overton 1984, 121).  Indeed, he sought to argue that the Agricultural Revolution \noccurred in the 16th and 17th centuries and only received \u201cfinishing touches\u201d from \nthe likes of Bakewell (Kerridge 1967; 1969).  While Kerridge\u2019s interpretation of the \nevidence was not unquestionably accepted (see, for example, Mingay 1969), by the \n1970s the period encompassed by the Agricultural Revolution was generally \nconsidered to range from 1560 to 1880, occurring in anywhere up to five stages and \n\u201cvarying considerably in its timing across different farming regions\u201d (Beckett 1990, x, \n9; Overton 1996a). \n \nMore recent historical studies have broadly divided the study of this subject into two \ncamps.  One school contends that the change in agricultural practice, previously \ntermed \u2018the Agricultural Revolution\u2019, was not revolutionary at all, but was rather a \nlong and gradual process, which may have comprised various stages of significant \ndevelopment that varied considerably in space and time (Allen 1991; Beckett 1990; \nThirsk 1987).  The other school has maintained that the concept of an Agricultural \nRevolution is valid and asserts that while earlier improvements in agricultural practice \ndid occur, only the 18th and 19th centuries are deserving of that appellation because \nof the magnitude of change (Campbell and Overton 1993; Overton 1996a; Overton \n1996b; Mingay 1989; Turner et al. 2001). \n \nArchaeology is well placed to contribute to this field of contention since it provides a \nline of enquiry that is independent of the historical crop and livestock data upon \nwhich the noted interpretations have largely been constructed. Indeed, a recent \n 5\narchaeological study has lead to the formulation of an alternative understanding of \nagricultural \u2018improvements\u2019, arguing that not just one revolution occurred in the 18th \nand 19th centuries but many, with different regions following their own unique \ntrajectories (Williamson 2002, 158-9). As both Overton (1984, 131; 1996a, 12) and \nWilliamson (2002, 165) note, one of the key problems in the analysis of historical \ndata has been that animal output and improvements in livestock are difficult to \nmeasure. Crucially, zooarchaeological evidence has the potential to redress this \nproblem. \n \nThe zooarchaeology of \u2018improvement\u2019 \n \nIntroduction \nFrom a methodological standpoint there are two principal means by which \nzooarchaeological data can be used to explore the issue of \u2018improvement\u2019: through the \nexamination of changes in the conformation (size and shape) of animals, as \nestablished through the measurement of particular skeletal elements, and through the \nanalysis of mortality profiles.  \n \nAs Reitz and Ruff (1994, 699) note, animal body size is controlled by the complex \ninterplay of both genotypic (genetic) and phenotypic (environmental) factors. In \ndomestic animals, for example, previous archaeological studies have shown how the \nconformation of animals can be influenced by environmental adaptation and \ngeographical origin (e.g. Cossette and Horard-Herbin 2003; Reitz and Ruff 1994) and \n 6\nhusbandry strategies (e.g. Higham and Message 1969).  Analysis of medieval and \npost-medieval fauna from Britain has also demonstrated that size and shape change \ncan provide a proxy indicator of deliberate attempts to \u2018improve\u2019 animal productivity \n(Albarella 1997; Davis 1997; Davis and Beckett 1999).  In the latter context, \nbiometrical analyses can provide indications of the causes of change since tooth size \nis largely dictated by genotype and is less affected by environmental conditions \nduring development, while the size of the post-cranial skeleton can be influenced by \nboth genotypic and phenotypic factors.  In effect, an increase in the size of skeletal \nelements, in the absence of a size change in teeth, might signify an \u2018improvement\u2019 in \nnutritional intake, while any change in the size of teeth could be a consequence of \nselective breeding or the introduction of new stock.   \n \nAnalyses of ageing data also have the potential to identify animal \u2018improvement\u2019 \nsince animals that fattened quicker may have been slaughtered at an earlier age - a \ndevelopment that would have facilitated an increased supply in meat.  Such an \ninterpretation requires the assumption that skeletal maturation (i.e. epiphyseal closure \nand dental eruption) was decoupled from flesh growth rates through selective \nbreeding.  While historical evidence indicates that this had occurred by the 18th \ncentury, with Bakewell\u2019s new breeds of sheep being slaughtered at two years of age \n(Beckett 1990, 25; Chambers and Mingay 1966, 67), Daniel Defoe, who published a \nthree-volume travel guidebook to Britain in the 1720s, noted that bullocks and sheep \nfattened very slowly (around four years of age) (Chambers and Mingay 1966, 67).  \nThus, if the historical evidence is reliable, it seems unlikely that the separation of \nskeletal development and soft-tissue mass occurred prior to the 18th century.  \nMoreover, while changes in mortality profiles are identifiable through the analysis of \n 7\nepiphyseal closure and tooth eruption and wear data, these may be affected by a range \nof other husbandry decisions, such as increasing consumer demand for tender meat; \nthe emergence of more specialised farming (such as dairying and veal production); or \nchanging emphasis on particular products (such as those required for the wool and \ncloth trade). \n \nA supplementary means by which selective breeding might be identifiable is through \nthe presence of certain congenital traits, such as the absent hypoconulid (third pillar) \nin cattle and sheep lower third molars (Miles and Grigson 1990), or the congenital \nabsence of the second premolar (Andrews and Noddle 1975).  Although it is \nhypothesised that these conditions might provide indications of gene flow, the full \npotential of this technique is yet to be fully realised (O\u2019Connor 2000, 122).  \n \nWhile the benefits of these approaches are clear, such data must not be interpreted \nuncritically.  Firstly, we have to question the extent to which a change in the \nconformation of domestic animals in later medieval and post-medieval Britain is a \nmarker of increased productivity.  If we consider the statement made by Gervase \nMarkham (a late 16th- \/early 17th-century writer and poet) that \u201cthe larger that every \ncow is, the better she is\u201d (cited in Davis and Beckett 1999, 13), then such an \nassumption would appear valid.  Furthermore, by the 16th century, substantially built \nDutch cows were being imported into various parts of England for breeding (Trow-\nSmith 1957, 203).  However, we must consider the evidence presented by Kerridge \n(1967, 313-314) who, in discussing the new stock associated with the Agricultural \n 8\nRevolution, noted that while the Midland Plain pasture sheep produced large \nquantities of mutton and wool, the animals had shorter legs.  It is equally possible that \nother \u2018improvements\u2019 may have had no discernible impact on the conformation of the \nskeleton, but resulted in developments of other desired characteristics, such as \nincreased milk production, or finer quality meat or wool. Finally, it should be noted \nthat \u2018improvement\u2019 in one commodity might have resulted in deterioration of other \naspects of the animal.  For example, while Bakewell\u2019s New Longhorn cattle were \nmore fatty, they produced less milk and, despite their superior growth rate, his New \nLeicester sheep were unsuited to exposed environments (Beckett 1990, 24).   \n \nClearly, the zooarchaeological data are not unproblematic, but integrated with other \nlines of evidence they provide a potentially valuable source of information regarding \n\u2018improvements\u2019 in animal husbandry in medieval and post-medieval Britain. In the \nfollowing sections previous and new approaches to this theme of investigation are \nconsidered. \n \nPrevious research \n \nIn the late 1990s a number of zooarchaeological studies were published regarding the \ntiming and nature of improvements in animal husbandry in later medieval and post-\nmedieval England.  By plotting histograms of measurements of specific bones, an \nincrease in the size of cattle and sheep between the 15th and 17th centuries was \nobserved on a number of sites (Davis and Beckett 1999, table 2).  The size increase in \n 9\ncattle appears to have been rather sudden, for sheep it was a much more gradual \nphenomenon, while \u2018improvements\u2019 in pig and domestic fowl were not observed \nbefore the 17th century (Albarella 1997, 21). For the most part, this evidence \nconsisted of post-cranial bone data, however, evidence from Launceston Castle, \nCornwall (Albarella and Davis 1996), and Castle Mall, Norwich (Albarella et al. \n1997) (figure 1), also revealed an increase in the size of cattle and sheep teeth. Thus, \nit was argued that the variation was at least partly a consequence of the introduction \nof new stock or artificial selection.  This evidence was initially used to support the \nargument of historians such as Kerridge, that the Agricultural Revolution occurred \nearlier than originally supposed (e.g. Davis 1997, 413), although a later \nreinterpretation resulted in a more tempered perspective: \u201cagricultural improvements \nwere already underway in the 15th and 16th centuries, and \u2026 improvement in animal \nhusbandry should be viewed more as a long term and gradual development \u2026 rather \nthan a revolutionary one\u201d (Davis and Beckett 1999, 14).  \n  \nNew evidence \n \nWe can turn now, however, to a sizeable body of faunal material, which has the scope \nto expand some of this earlier work and raise further questions concerning the timing \nand nature of improvements in animal husbandry. Specifically, we can examine the \nlarge assemblage of animal bones from Dudley Castle, West Midlands (figure 1).   \n \nThe medieval market town of Dudley is situated 15km north-west of Birmingham. \nExcavations were carried out at the castle there between 1983 and 1993 after growing \nconcern that modern pollution, together with natural weathering, had left many of the \n 10\nfriable sandstone structures of the castle in danger of collapse (Boland 1984). During \nthe excavation ten phases of activity were identified stretching from the 11th to the \n18th century (Thomas 2002; forthcoming). The faunal assemblage totalled over \n15\u2019000 fragments of bones recorded using a \u2018one zone per bone\u2019 strategy (Davis \n1992).  While the animal bones were largely dominated by domestic taxa, the high \nproportions of wild mammals, particularly deer, and wild birds, testify to the high \nstatus nature of consumption at the site (Thomas 2002; forthcoming). \n \nFigures 2-5 illustrate some of the biometrical data from this site for cattle, sheep, and \npig and domestic fowl. The log ratio method has been partly employed in this analysis \nbecause it permits the combination of different measurements of the same species \nonto the same axis, thus increasing the size of biometrical datasets (Albarella 2002; \nMeadow 1999).  In essence, the technique involves converting all measurements to \nlogarithms.  A single specimen, or group of specimens, is then chosen as a standard \nfor comparison (see figure legends); in this study, however, it is the relationship \nbetween the data from different phases of the site, rather than the comparison of the \ndata values against the standard, that is of interest.  The log ratio is calculated by \nsubtracting the log of each measurement from the log of the standard.  A log ratio of \nzero implies the measurement is the same size as the standard, a positive value \nimplies that it is larger, and a negative value that it is smaller.  Measurements from \nbones and teeth were not combined because, as Albarella (2002, 54) notes, teeth \nrespond differently than post-cranial bones to environmental conditions, sex and age. \nWhere the sample sizes permitted, measurements taken along the same plane, i.e. \nlengths, widths and depths, were also considered together, because biometrical studies \nhave demonstrated that these are highly correlated (see, for example, Davis 1996). For \n 11\nsheep (figure 3), all measurements have been combined on the same axis because of \nthe small sample sizes.  All measurements were taken on adult bones using Vernier \ncalipers, following the standards published by von den Driesch (1976), Bull and \nPayne (1988) and Davis (1992).  \n \nScrutiny of these diagrams reveals that a substantial, and statistically significant, \nincrease in the size of cattle, sheep, pig and domestic fowl, occurred sometime around \nthe middle of the 14th century (figures 2-5, 7). More detailed analysis of the \nbiometrical data from Dudley Castle (Thomas 2002; forthcoming) has revealed that \nfor cattle, and domestic fowl, the size change affected all three anatomical planes \n(height, width and depth). Consequently, for these species at least, it is not possible to \nlink the change in conformation to any shift in the sexual composition of the stock; no \nchange in the relative proportion of males, females or castrates, would result in an \nincrease in all dimensions (e.g. Fock 1966; Higham 1969; Thomas 1988). The \nunfortunate paucity of measurable sheep and cattle teeth from the site (Thomas 2002) \nmakes it difficult to determine whether the size change only affected post-cranial \nbones.  In pigs, however, it is clear that the size increase is at least partly genetically \ncontrolled (figure 4). In later post-medieval phases at the site, there was virtually no \nother biometrical variation (Thomas 2002; forthcoming). \n \nAt face value, this evidence would suggest that the \u2018improvement\u2019 of most domestic \nlivestock was occurring, at least at this one site, from as early as the middle of the \n14th century.  While the temptation exists to associate these quite dramatic changes \nwith an earlier incarnation of the Agricultural Revolution (sensu Davis 1997), which \n 12\nbecame manifest at other sites at a slightly later date (Davis and Beckett 1999, table \n2), the data for later post-medieval sites require consideration, since the observations \nnoted at Dudley Castle may instead reflect entirely different phenomena. \nUnfortunately, there is a marked paucity of excavated and published faunal \nassemblages dating from the later 18th and 19th centuries - the period when historical \nsources inform us that productivity expanded quickly and sustainably.  \n \nLater post-medieval (i.e. 17th \u2013 19th century) assemblages of animal bones have often \nbeen neglected.  Not only are they often sacrificed at the expense of the \u2018more \ninteresting\u2019 earlier periods but they are also frequently truncated by later development \nand affected by problems of residuality (Thomas 1999, 342). As Davis and Beckett \n(1999, 6) note, we also have to contend with the fact that waste management was \nmuch more effective in this period. Indeed, comparison of the percentage of gnawed \nbones (which can provide a proxy indicator of redeposition) from 19th-century \ndeposits at Stafford Castle (2%) with earlier dated deposits at Dudley Castle (11-37%) \nprovides some support for this interpretation (Thomas 2002; 2003). Sample sizes from \nthese later sites also tend to be small, although the application of scaling techniques \nfor biometrical analysis (Albarella 2002; Meadow 1999) can be used to overcome \nsuch problems.   \n \nA recent study of the animal bones from 19th- and 20th-century deposits at Stafford \nCastle was undertaken to attempt to redress this gap (Thomas 2003). This site is \nparticularly useful since it is located only 40km from Dudley Castle (figure 1). \nUnfortunately, only sheep provided a sufficiently large dataset for detailed \n 13\nbiometrical analysis. However, examination of these data demonstrate that the 19th \ncentury sheep were somewhat larger on average than those from slightly earlier dating \ndeposits at Dudley Castle (Thomas 2002; forthcoming) and Launceston Castle \n(Albarella and Davis 1996), although those from Lincoln (Dobney et al. n.d.) were \nmarginally bigger (Figures 6-7). The fact that the sheep from Lincoln were larger may \nreflect regional variation \u2013 a phenomenon that has its origins in the early post-\nmedieval period (e.g. Albarella 1997). However, the fact that the Stafford Castle \nsheep were larger than the sheep from Dudley Castle might suggest that new breeds of \nsheep were introduced into the region, or that existing sheep were improved, \nsometime in the later 18th or 19th century.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nA slowly growing body of zooarchaeological evidence indicates that agricultural \npractice was changing from the 14th century onwards, although there was some \nregional variation, with outlying sites generally experiencing later developments than \nmore central localities (Davis 1997; Davis and Beckett 1999). Moreover, in some \nplaces (such as Dudley Castle), the change in size seemingly occurs over a short \nperiod of time, while at other sites it is a much more gradual affair, such as \nLaunceston Castle, Cornwall (Albarella and Davis 1996).  \n \nClearly, the data from Dudley Castle reveal a fairly dramatic change in animal size in \nthe 14th century, but does this represent an earlier incarnation of the \u2018Agricultural \nRevolution\u2019?  As noted above, this term was coined to describe a period (1760-1830) \n 14\nwhich saw \u201cthe agricultural sector of the economy [move] to a new level of \nproductivity, which it was able to sustain\u201d (Beckett 1990, ix). It affected the whole of \nfarming, not just one particular sector (Beckett 1990, ix). Overton (1996a, 3) outlines \nthree criteria by which revolutions in agricultural practice might be identifiable:  \n? a variety of changes in farming techniques, including the introduction of new \ncrops, new husbandry techniques, and the improvement of livestock; \n? the ability to feed a growing population;  \n? an increase in productivity. \n \nThe increase in the size of the principal domesticates may be a fairly good indicator of \nthe introduction of \u2018improved\u2019 livestock. However, this by no means satisfies the \nthree criteria outlined above, particularly since the 14th century was anything but a \nperiod of population growth.  As Mingay (1989, 481) notes, at best \u201cthe time period \ninvolved stretches the term \u2018Agricultural Revolution\u2019 to little more than a convenient \nlabel\u201d. Rather than try and associate the changes evident in the zooarchaeological \nassemblage at Dudley Castle with any particular \u2018revolution\u2019, it is more valuable to \nview the changes that occurred in the nature of animal husbandry in the light of \nexisting historical evidence for the period (Thirsk 1987, 57-8). \n \nThe most plausible hypothesis to account for the pattern witnessed at Dudley Castle is \nthat it reflects changes in agricultural and tenurial organisation in the post-Black \nDeath period, coupled with change in the environmental landscape. Following the \ndemographic decline in the wake of a host of disasters in 14th-century England, there \nis some evidence to suggest that agricultural improvement became a more pressing \n 15\nissue. In the earlier medieval period, the rising population had lead to an expansion of \narable farming and forced sheep and cattle to graze on more marginal lands. However, \nfollowing the Black Death (caused by Bubonic Plague spread by rat-borne infected \nfleas initially in 1348-1350) the demand to feed an expanding population had \ndissipated and the market in grain crashed. Animal husbandry thus became a more \nviable alternative and, while much more land intensive, it was much less labour \nintensive, thus suiting the prevailing socio-economic conditions (Hopcroft 1994, \n1576). It is for this reason that a dramatic rise in the conversion of arable to pasture \n(and thus the movement of animals off more marginal land to which they had been \npreviously restricted) occurred in this period which, alongside increased land-holdings \nand an expansion in enclosure, allowed greater control to be exercised over the food \nintake of animals and breeding (Dyer 1981; Hopcroft 1994; Williamson 2002). With \nrespect to pigs, a widespread decline in numbers on archaeological sites, together with \nthe greater consumption of neonatal animals, and the increase in size (enabled through \ngreater control over breeding and nutrition) appears to be characteristic of a move \ntowards sty farming (Thomas 2002; forthcoming). In the early medieval period, it \nwould have been possible to keep large herds of pigs within woodland, in a semi-feral \nstate, inter-breeding with local populations of wild boar. Following extensive \nwoodland clearance, particularly in the 12th-14th centuries (e.g. Rackham 1986, 88), \nhowever, the keeping of such large populations of pigs would have been a less viable \noption.  After the Black Death, there would have also been more underused waste \nland on which pigs could root which, together with a decline in woodland \nmanagement, may have further accelerated the move towards sty-feeding (Chris Dyer \npers. comm.). \n \n 16\nFollowing the events of the mid- to late-14th century, there was also an increasing \nmove away from direct management, towards leasing for cash rents, as landlords \nsought to minimise economic loss. A consequence of this, coupled with increasing \nwage demands in this period, was a downward social distribution of access to land \n(Dyer 1981). Since these new landowners were leasing for cash rent, they may have \nbeen more interested in enhancing the profitability of their stock, which may in turn \nhave lead to improvements in animal husbandry. As Dyer (1997, 306) notes, \u201cin some \ncircumstances lords could have acted as a drag on change\u201d. Moreover, peasants who \nbecame landowners in this period are likely to have been in more \u201cintimate contact\u201d \nwith the animals and better able to take \u201ctechnological initiatives\u201d (Dyer 1997, 308; \nsee also Allen 1991, 252).  Why, in either case, the evidence for similar changes in \nanimal husbandry practice in the same period has not been identified elsewhere is \ncurious, particularly since the communal grazing of the open field system in the \nMidlands is more likely to have inhibited stock breeding (Hopcroft 1994, 1581). The \npossibility exists, however, that landowners in this region were pioneering \ntechnological advances, which may have taken centuries to become established in \nother areas (Thomas forthcoming). \n \nFrom the 15th century onwards a greater number of factors were influencing the \ndevelopment of animal husbandry. These included: \n? Increasing population; \n? freeing up of cattle as traction animals with the increased use of horses for \nploughing;  \n? increasing agricultural specialisation (veal and dairy production); \n 17\n? expansion and contraction of the wool and cloth industries (Albarella \n1997). \n \nBy the 18th and 19th centuries the need to feed a rapidly expanding and industrialised \npopulation must have exerted further pressures on animal resources. Overton (1996a, \n75) indeed suggests that there was an increase in meat production of the order of \n150% and of 250% for dairy produce in this period. Moreover, Turner et al. (2001, \n174-207) demonstrate that a significant increase in carcass weights occurred in the \n19th century.  This might partly reflect selective breeding, but the period also \nwitnessed the emergence of better housing for animals and the more widespread use \nof different fodder - e.g. oil-cakes, clover, and turnips - as well as well drained pasture \n(Williamson 2002, 166). Unfortunately, the extent to which these historically-attested \nproductivity increases are visible in the zooarchaeological record is precluded by a \npaucity of evidence. Tentative evidence from Stafford Castle, noted above, would \nsuggest that, at least in some regions, this \u2018improvement\u2019 was reflected in the \nskeletons of certain animals. However, the increase in size appears to reflect a \ncontinuum of development from the 14th century rather than any particular \n\u2018revolution\u2019. \n \nConclusions \n \n \nThe debate regarding the existence, timing and nature of animal improvements in the \nlater medieval and post-medieval periods is ongoing. While it is difficult to be certain \nthat an increase in the size of animals is a sufficiently good marker of improvement, \n 18\nagriculture was certainly not static in the later medieval and post-medieval periods. \nThe animal bone data would tend to support Beckett (1990), that particular regions \nfollowed their own trajectories of development, and that change in animal husbandry \nwas a much more diverse and gradual process, thus calling the \u201cgrand historical \nnarrative\u201d into further question (e.g. Johnson 1996, 5). At Dudley Castle, \n\u2018improvements\u2019 in animal husbandry appear to have been occurring from at least the \nlater 14th century as a consequence of the changing agricultural and tenurial \nlandscape. Such changes are not currently archaeologically visible elsewhere until the \n15th and 16th centuries, although it is likely that the stimulus for improvement at any \nsite would have reflected a combination of local, regional and national environmental \nand socio-economic conditions. This evidence provides some support for the 19th-\ncentury writings of John Burke, who defines the period during the reign of Edward III \n(1326-1377) as the \u201cdawn of general agricultural improvement\u201d, and contended that \nthese changes continued through the 15th and 17th centuries (Davis 1997, 414).  The \ndata from Stafford Castle would suggest that improvements in animal husbandry did \nindeed occur in the 19th century. However, the extent to which these can be called \n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 is difficult to establish, given the paucity of animal bone assemblages \nfrom this crucial period across Britain.  Without the collection, analysis and \npublication of much more raw biometrical and ageing data from later post-medieval \nsites this issue will remain frustratingly unresolved. Only with of a sufficiently large \ndataset from this period, will it be possible to critically examine the archaeological \nvisibility of the historically-attested productivity increases associated with the \ntraditionally dated Agricultural Revolution.\n 19\nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper was original presented at the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in \nTheory (CHAT) conference in November 2004 at the University of Leicester, UK.
