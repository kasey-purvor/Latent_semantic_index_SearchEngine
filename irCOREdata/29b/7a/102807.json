INTRODUCTION \nThe introduction of broadcast and multicast modes of \nservice delivery in terrestrial mobile networks is one way to \naddress concerns regarding the additional traffic load generated \nby bandwidth-demanding multimedia services. The ongoing \nstandardization work within the 3GPP MBMS (Multimedia \nBroadcast Multicast Services) framework is moving along this \ndirection [I]. More drastic approaches rely on synergies \nbetween 3G networks and broadcast systems. This paper \nevolves around a hybrid terrestrial-satellite system that uses a \ngeostationary satellite component for MBMS delivery. \nThe satellite component of the system is unidirectional, \nnamely there is no satellite retum link. A retum path is rather \nprovided via the terrestrial mobile network calling for a higher \nintegration between the terrestrial and the satellite system \ncomponents. Central to the system concept is the use of \nterrestrial gap-fillers, hereafier identified as intermediate \nmodide repeatem (IMR). The introduction of IMRs in the \nsystem architecture has been deemed mandatory in order to \novercome the inability of mobile satellite systems to provide \nadequate urban and indoor coverage. With this additional \nfeature, the handheld mobile terminal receives data through the \nsatellite and\/or the intermediate module that features one-way \nrepeater functionality. The satellite path would be the preferred \ncommunication link (direct access-DA), hut if thc user's \nsatellite path were blocked, the communication link would he \nsustained via the IMR stations (indirect access-IDA). The \nM .  Neri, G. Alhertazzi \nDEIS\/ARCES \nUniversity of Bologna, Italy \ngalbertazzi@deis.uniho.it \nintroduction of lMRs provides significant power gains, which \nare however to be weighted up along with the intrinsic \ngeneration of artifrciut multipath. \nWe focus subsequently on the long-term radio resource \nmanagement (RRM) functions related to the satellite \ncomponent of the hybrid system. Firstly, we briefly introduce \nthe reference Wideband CDMA (WCDMA)-based access \nscheme, engineered within the European IST SATIN project' \n[2] as an adaptation of the 3GPP UMTS Terrestrial Radio \nAccess (UTRA) Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) air \ninterface [ 3 ] .  The two service categories -or, better, service \ndelivery modes- supported by the system, namely streaming \nand push and store (download) services, are subsequently \ndescribed and a rough methodology for the derivation of the \nsystem-level traffic demand is outlined in section 111. The \nestimated traffic demand is then used for the computation of \nthc radio resources required for streaming services in section 0. \nRemaining resources are then available for the support of push \n& store services. The amount of push & store content that can \nbe supported is estimated in section V as a function of it5 type, \nsize and relative popularity. Finally, a capacity analysis is \npresented in section 0 reporting the aggregate rates than can he \nsupported in the system, under three different assumptions for \nthe radio propagation conditions. \n11. SATELLITE RADIO INTERFACE AND RADIO RESOURCE \nMANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe satellite radio interface design targets maximum \ncommonalties with the FDD mode of the T-UMTS air \ninterface. Fig. 1 shows the channels that were retained in the \nsatellite radio access scheme design along with their mapping \nthrough the scheme layers\/suh-layers. The channels of the \nsatellite access scheme effectively form a subset of the full \nchannel set o f  UTRA FDD. In particular, given the point-to- \nmultipoint (p-t-mp) nature of supported services, this subset \nincludes only common channels. \nFor the multimedia data transport, there is one-to-one \ncorrespondence between service flow and logical channel \n(common traffic channel ~ CTCH2). The logical channels are \nI The IST SATIN project, w.ist-sal in.org,  is partly funded by the European \nUnion under its 5' research framework program. ' Work progress within the 3GPP MBMS framework 141 suggests that a new \nlogical channel will be introduced into the UMTS standard far the support o f  \nMBMS, called Multicast Common Trafic Channel (MTCH).

At the physical level, secondary common \ncontrol channels (S-CCPCHs) cany (multiplex) one or more \nFACHs. S-CCPCHs are fixed spreading factor channels \nmaking use of the full spreading factor range reported in 3GPP \nstandards (4-256). We refer the interested reader to [2] for a \nmore detailed description of the satellite radio interface layers \nat both the data-plane and the signalling plane, while we devote \nthe rest of this section to some RRM considerations. \nService \ncategory \nservices \nPush & \nStore \nservices \n0 Primary relevance for SAT-MBMS \nTraffic \nhandling \npriority \nUMTS QOS Service type class \nStreaming Audio Streaming I \nStreaming Video Streaming I \nInteractive' Location Based Services 2 \nWebcasting Normal \nRich audiolvideo info High \nLow Prestored movie on \ndemand \nBackground demand PE-stared video on LOW \nPrc-stared radio on . ~~~~ \nFigure I. The mapping af channels within the SATIN radio interface \nThe satellite component of the hybrid system is primarily \noriented towards streaming (e.g. audio, video broadcasting, \nalert and emergency announcements) and push & store \napplications (e.g. infotainment, entertainment, software \ndelivery, webcasting). In fact, streaming and push & store \nshould be seen as service delivery mechanisms. The same \ncontent may reach the mobile user in either of the two modes: \nin the first case the multimedia content can be played directly \nupon reception at the user terminal, whereas in the second case \nthe multimedia content is stored in a local cache for later \nprocessing @re-stored content). \nOn the other hand, the absence of return link means that the \nsatellite radio access network cannot have real time feedback \nfrom the user-groups, such as user-side measurements, directly \nrestricting the system short-term RRM functions: no fast \npower-control is feasible and the packet scheduler decides on \nits allocations without knowledge of the state of individual \nchannels; what is called channel state dependent scheduling is \nnot possible. In both cases, even if a return satellite link were \navailable, the user feedback would have to be exploited in non- \nstandard manner due to the point-to-multipoint nature of the \nservices. \nBoth factors, the p-t-mp service nature and the \nunidirectional system, increase the importance of the longer- \nterm RRM functions of the system satellite component. The \napproach we describe for the configuration of the satellite radio \ninterface resembles dimensioning procedures well known from \nterrestrial wired networks. It relies on prediction of traffic \ndemand for real-time streaming traffic, which may be based on \nhistorical data drawn from measurements. This is then \nexploited to derive a static radio bearer (RB) configuration over \nsome interval of time, over which the traffic mix remains the \nsame. The remaining capacity is used for the transmission of \npush & store services. \ndemand \nPre-stored music on \ndemand \nSoftware download \nin the paper applies equally to this new channel. at least regarding the data \ntransfer functions. \nLUW \nLOW \nNormal \n111. TRAFFIC ESTIMATION FOR STREAMING SERVICES \nThe estimation of traffic demand for multicastibroadcast \nservices proved to be particularly challenging for two main \nreasons: \nThe services under consideration are point-to-multipoint, \nhence the system requirements cannot be derived via a \nstraightfonvard multiplication of the user requirements \ntimes number of subscribers, which is the standard practice \nin unicast systems. \nThere is lack of historical data on the demand for a number \nof services (i.e. streaming) and the usage pattems related to \nit. This lack is not specific to satellite or, in general, \nwireless networks. The relevant literature is poor even in \nthe context of wired networks. \nThe characterisation of the services has been differentiated \nfor the two main types of services (table I). Streaming service \nflows are characterised in terms of the attributes in [SI such as \nguaranteed rate, maximum rate, SDU error rate, packet size etc. \nOn the other hand, in the case of push & store services, there is \nno inherent guaranteed or peak rate. Individual items within \neach service categoly are characterized by their size and the \naggregate user demand for them. For these services the actual \nrate will be determined when deriving the broadcast schedules \n(see section V). \nThe methodology for the derivation of the traffic demand \nfor streaming services in described in detail in [6] and it is \nsummarized in [2]. Two different user profiles have been \nconsidered conesponding to typical user and business user \nbehaviour. Traffic mix scenarios were built for two busy hours \nof the day, corresponding to dominant contribution by the \nbusiness user and the typical user respectively. Four traffic \nmixes have been derived by considering the system at two \ndifferent instants of its life, corresponding to different \nsubscriber volumes \nTABLE 1. SERVICES CONSIDERED AND THEIR TRAFFIC HANDLING \nPRlORlTY ACCORDING TO [SI \n' The usc of the word interactive in this table deviates a little from the context \nof the ward interactive within 3GPP: Location Based Services are provided \nvia the streaming service delivery mechanism, i.c. they are not cached. \nHowever they do not impose Che strict per-packet requirements of audiolvideo \nstreaming but rather a requirement for the total delively time of the content. \n0-7803-8255-2\/w\/$20.00 02004 IEE. 2858 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \nIn the following we maintain the first traffic mix (hereafter \ncalled traffic mix 1) for demonstration purposes [2]. This \ntraffic mix is input to the dimensioning procedure to provide \nthe radio bearer configuration in the satellite radio interface. \nIV. RADIO BEARER CONFIGURATION FOR STREAMING \nSERVICES \nThe assumption is that there is some minimum \ncharacterisation of individual services in terms of amval rate \nA,, duration p, and requested rate for each type of service Ri . \nThis task allows the configuration of the bearers such as the \nnumber of FACHs, rates and mapping to S-CCPCHs. It may be \nsplit into more than one step, whose actual context depends on \nthe assumptions about the available service characterization. \nA .  Estimation of required CTCHdFACHs \nLet S he the set of different services. A service flow is \ncharacterised by the 3-tuple {A,, ,uj , R j  } ; in this context, audio \nbroadcast at 32 kbps is regarded as a different service than \naudio broadcast at 64kbps. The cardinality of the service set is \nN, i.e. lSl=N. No assumption is made for the flow burstiness; \nthe flow might be of constant or variable bit rate but in the \nlatter case the R, value is set to the meadguaranteed rate \nattribute. Each element S, corresponds to a member of the \nservice set, i.e. a service. Let Pb, a vector of size N \ncorresponding to blocking probabilities targeted for each \nservice, namely there is one-to-one correspondence between si \nand PL,. Then the required FACHs for each si can be derived \nvia use of well-known results of classical queuing theory: \nFrom the m-server loss queueing system (see, for example \n[7]), for each service type S, separately. This implies \ninvocation of the MlMlmlm formula N times. \ne From the extension of the Erlangian formula to the \nmultiple services scenario over all types of flows si \nrequesting the same rate R j  , irrespective of the arrival \nrates or service durations of the individual services. The \nrespective formula (see e.g. [XI) is applicable under the \ncomplete-sharing (CS) assumption: FACHs can be fully \nshared among services requesting the same rates, as long \nas the derived Transport Format Combination Set (TFCS) \ncan cope with possible discrepancies at the packet level. \nIn both cases the required number of FACHs is the number \nof servers of rate R, that will guarantee the target blocking \nprobabilities PL,. The outcome of this step for traffic mix 1 is \ngiven in table 11. \nTABLE II. REQUIRED FACHS FOR TRAFFIC MIX I (TARGET GOS I%)  \nFACH rate I 16kbps 1 32kbps I 64kbpr I 128khps I 256khps \n#ofFACHs I 8 1 4 1  5 1  3 1 2  \nB. \nThe objective of this function is to map the FACHs \nestimated in 1V.A to the available S-CCPCHs. The number of \navailable S-CCPCHs M and their maximum capacity c ,  or a \nrough estimation of theirs, are known a priori from link budget \nMapping of the FACHs on S-CCPCHs \nexercises and link-level simulation input. The link budgets for \nthe indirect case dictated a maximum supported bit rate of \n384kbps, corresponding to SF 8. Allowing codes for the \nbroadcast channel and the announcement channel, the available \nS-CCPCHs at SF 8 are 6-7. In the following demonstrations, \nwe assume the availability of 6 S-CCPCHs of  SF 8. \nThere are two alternatives for this mapping: \nThe first option is to ignore the power requirements (ED, )  \nof individual services. Then a mathematical formulation of the \nproblem could be: \n\\1 \nminimize z = C y ,  \n,=, \nsubjectto i R , x ,  < c y , ,  j c { l . . N ]  \n\/= \nwhere y ,  = I if S-CCPCH j is used or 0 otherwise and x,, = I ,  if \nservice (FACH) i is assigned to S-CCPCH j ,  0 otherwise. This \nis the hin-packing problem [lo]: the FACHs are the items that \nhave to be packed into the minimum possible number of bins \n(S-CCPCHs). A feasible solution of the problem corresponds \nto cost values z less than or equal to M. Both approximate and \nexact algorithms are available for the solution of this problem; \ngiven the rather small number of S-CCPCHs, computation \nefficiency does not pose significant constraints \nThe second option is to take into consideration the power \nrequirements (E&\u201d) of the individual services into what we \ncall power-aware packing. In this type of service packing we \napply a variation of the bin-packing algorithm to derive a \nmapping that minimizes the power waste, in that it allocates \nservices of similar power requirements to each S-CCPCH. The \nEI\/N, requirement is a function of the Transport Block (TB) \nsize most frequently used. \nThe obiective function now becomes: \nminimize j e  {I..N}) \nAlthough the objective function in this case is non-linear \nand less conventional, adaptations of the approximate \nalgorithms for the classical bin-packing problem [lo] can be \nused to obtain an approximate solution of the problem. \nThe mappings for the two alternatives described above are \ngiven in table 111. As expected, the power-aware mapping tends \nto bring together in the same code channel services of similar \nperformance at the physical layer. \nC. Derivation of theper S-CCPCH TFCS \nStrict rules or algorithms for this task are difficult to devise. \nIn any case, deriving the TFCS a priori on the basis of traffic \npredictions is not too efficient. The TFCS should be broad \nenough to capture the packet-level dynamics of the services \nexpected over some future time interval. The wider the range of \nservices, the broader the TFCS should be with direct impact on \nthe terminal processing requirements. \nThe chosen TB sizes should he in line with the packet sizes \nexpected from the applications, so that framing overheads in \nterms of headers and padding are minimum. \n0-7803-8255-W20.00 0Uw)Q IEEE. 2859 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

DIMENSIONING FOR PUSH & STORE SERVICES \nSystem capacity not required for streaming services is used \nfor the delivery of push-and-store services. This is the residual \ncapacity after deriving the FACH requirements for streaming \nservices and is organized into FACHs carrying broadcast \nschedules. \nEach broadcast schedule cames several items of various \ncontent types such as  compressed HTML pages, audio files, \nvideo clips, and software packages. The requirement for these \nservices is the design of efficient broadcast schedules that, in \ncombination with cache management algorithms at the terminal \nside, minimize the average response time. This is defined as the \ntime elapsing from the moment a user expresses hisher will to \nreceive some content up to the moment the content is stored at \nhisher terminal, averaged over all items. The design of \noptimum broadcast schedules considers the number and sizes \nof the individual items and their demand probabilities. The \nmore popular a certain item is, the more frequently it appears \nwithin the broadcast cycle over the air. \nApparently the design of broadcast schedules targeting \ndifferent response times is a way to support service \ndifferentiation for push and store services. The maximum \nnumber of items that can be accommodated on a broadcast \nschedule as a function of the capacity of the FACH channel \nthat will deliver them, for different target response times, is \nestimated on the basis of the bounds provided in [ I  I]  for items, \nof different length distributions and demand probabilities. In \nthis sense, it is an upper bound. On the other hand, the use of \nintelligent cache management techniques at the terminal side \ncan reduce (resp. increase) the response time bounds (the \nnumber of supported items for a given bound) significantly. \nTarget response time (mins) \n5 IO I S  20 30 \n9 18 28 38 61 \n44 98 155 220 355 \n55 124 199 277 447 \nTABLE IV.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe paper presents a systematic approach for engineering \nthe satellite radio interface of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial \nsystem. Both the unidirectional nature of the system and the \nparticular service offering (point-to-multipoint services) favour \nmore static approaches to its configuration and dimensioning. \nWe describe a top-down approach that has as a starting \npoint the description of per-user traffic demand and leads to the \nderivation of the radio bearer configuration for streaming and \npush-and-store services in the satellite radio interface. The \napproach is generic in that it considers both service-delivery \nmechanisms and their requirements in terms of GradeiQuality \nof Service. An operator might include only one service type in \nhis offering andor  relax their GoSiQoS requirements. \nThe critical point of this approach has to do with the input \ninformation for the traffic demand estimation for point-to- \nmultipoint services. Few data are available on point-to- \nmultipoint services, not only with regard to satellite \ncommunication systems hut also in the more generic context of \ndata networking. We argue that this is one of the directions that \nshould attract the interest and efforts of the satellite research \ncommunity in the future so that approaches such as the one \ndescribed in this paper can be used with confidence in the \nengineering of multicastibroadcast satellite systems. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work presented in this paper bas benefited invaluably \nfrom discussions with partners in the IST SATIN project, \nincluding Alcatel Space (France), Agilent Technologies \n(Belgium), Space Hellas (Greece), Temagon (Greece) and the \nInstitute of Accelerated Systems and Applications of \nUniversity of Athens (Greece). \nREFERENCES \n3GPP TS 23.246, \u201cMultimedia Broadcasb\u2018Multicast Service; architecrure \nand functional description,\u201d Release 6 ,  September 2003 \nK.
