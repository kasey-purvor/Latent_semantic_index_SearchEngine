Gerhard Wickler received his Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1999. His research interests center on the description and brokering of capabilities of intelligent agents for which AI planning technologies can be used. In 1999 he joined ITC-IRST in Italy where he continued his work on intelligent agents in the tourism industry. In 2000 he moved on to Starlab, Belgium, a commercial research enterprise where he worked mainly on eLearning. In March 2002 he joined the University of Stuttgart where he worked on the EU-funded SCOOP project and started a course on AI search technologies. Since October 2004 he is now a member of AIAI, working on AI planning technologies that have been developed here for more than three decades. Stephen Potter is a Research Fellow in the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute within the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. His research interests surround the use of knowledge-based systems and semantic web technologies, with a particular focus on their application in emergency response contexts. Austin Tate is Director of the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI) and holds the Personal Chair of Knowledge-Based Systems at the University of Edinburgh. He helped form AIAI in 1984 and since that time has led its efforts to transfer the technologies and methods of artificial intelligence and knowledge systems into commercial, governmental and academic applications throughout the world. He holds degrees in Computer Studies (B.A. Lancaster, 1972) and Machine Intelligence (Ph.D. Edinburgh, 1975). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scotland\u2019s National Academy), and is a Fellow of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence amongst other honours. He is a professionally Chartered Engineer. He is Chief Technical Officer of I-C2 Systems Ltd. \u2013 a company seeking to develop advanced aids for emergency response. His internationally sponsored research work involves advanced knowledge and planning technologies, especially for use in emergency response.","cites":null},{"id":691468,"title":"Design space analysis: Bridging from theory to practice via design rationale.","authors":[],"date":"1991","doi":null,"raw":"MacLean, A., Young, R., Bellotti, V. and Moran, T.
