This paper was originally intended to \nbe a straightforward update of Esping-Andersen\u2019s labour market decommodification index, \nthe main element of TWW. However, in revisiting the TWW and recreating Esping-Andersen\u2019s \nindex, it was impossible to ignore the theoretical, empirical and methodological concerns that \nhave been expressed by other commentators (such as Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, \n1994; Ragin, 1994; Fawcett and Papadopoulos, 1997; Shalev, 1996; Pitruzello, 1999; Gough, \n2001; Arts and Gilssen, 2002), and indeed to acknowledge a couple of further issues that \nemerged specifically from this project.  \n \nThe purpose of this research note is therefore three-fold: Firstly, to discuss the theoretical, \nempirical and methodological limitations of Esping-Andersen\u2019s index and to use the updated \ndecommodification data to explore a specific issue \u2013 the use of population coverage to weight \neach of the constituent decommodification indexes (pensions, unemployment, sickness); \nsecondly, to discuss a, to date, overlooked error in Esping-Andersen\u2019s original calculations \nthat led to the incorrect positioning of three borderline countries - Japan in the middle \n(Conservative) decommodification group; and the UK and Ireland in the (Liberal) low \ndecommodification group; and thirdly to update and revisit the TWW decommodification index \nand examine how the relationships between the countries have changed. The paper \nconcludes by questioning the extent to which the TWW still exist, and indeed, at least in \nempirical terms, the extent to which they ever did. \n 5 \nDecommodification and the Worlds of Welfare \nIn the TWW (1990: 2), Esping-Andersen presented a typology of welfare states based \nrespectively upon the operationalisation of three principles: decommodification (which \nexamined the extent to which an individual\u2019s welfare is reliant upon the market), levels of \nsocial stratification (which examined the role of welfare states in maintaining or breaking down \nsocial stratification); and the private-public mix (which focused on the relative roles of the \nstate, the family and the market in welfare provision). He argued that theoretically (the idea of \nthree welfare state types was determined a priori to the empirical analysis see Esping-\nAndersen, 1990: 51), and empirically, that the application of these principles resulted in the \ndivision of welfare states into three qualitatively different regime types: Liberal (UK, USA, \nIreland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), Conservative (Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, \nItaly, Japan, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands), and Social Democratic \n(Nordic countries).  \n \nThe decommodification aspect of the three worlds analysis created and combined three \nindividual decommodification indexes (pensions, unemployment, and sickness).  An identical \nscoring process was used for each of these constituent schemes (Esping-Andersen, 1990: \n54), and so, for example, in the pensions index, decommodification was measured in terms of \nthe additive qualities of (1) Minimum pension benefits for a standard production worker \nearning average wages (expressed as a percentage replacement rate of the ratio of the pre-\ntaxation benefit to gross normal worker earnings in that year); (2) Standard pension benefits \nfor a normal worker, (expressed as a percentage replacement rate of the ratio of the pre-\ntaxation benefit to gross normal worker earnings in that year); (3) Contribution period required \nfor a standard pension; and (4) Individual\u2019s share of pension financing. Each country received \na score of 1 for low decommodification; 2 for medium; or 3 for high decommodification for \neach of these four indicators. The classification into three scores was done on the basis of \none standard deviation around the mean. Finally, these scores were added and weighted by \nthe percent of the (relevant) population covered by the program (for pensions, the take-up \nrate) with means-tested programs, such as in Australia, negatively scored (Esping-Andersen, \n1990: 54). The scores of the replacement rate variables (variables 1 and 2) were doubled in \n 6 \neach of the constituent indexes (i.e. the range of available scores for these variables were 2, \n4, or 6 rather than 1, 2 or 3). Finally, the three decommodification indexes were combined to \ngive an overall decommodification score for each country. \n \nTABLE 1 HERE PLEASE \n \nThese three indexes were a substantial influence on the final composition of the three worlds \ntypology (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 26-29, 52). However, as Table 1 shows, the actual \narrangement of countries into the three regimes when only the decommodification data is \nconsidered is slightly different from the finalised TWW typology (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 52). \nFor example, Austria is in the high scoring, Social Democratic, decommodification group \nwhere as in Esping-Andersen\u2019s finalised typology it is in the medium scoring, Conservative \nregime.  It should be noted that this is because the TWW typology is also based on \nconsideration of two other aspects of welfare state provision: stratification and the public-\nprivate mix (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 55, 79). The focus throughout this paper though is on \njust the decommodification elements. \n \nTheoretical, Empirical and Methodological Limitations \nAn extensive, and on-going, debate has surrounded Esping-Andersen\u2019s analysis of welfare \nstate decommodification and the resulting TWW typology (for a detailed summary see Arts \nand Gelissen, 2002). This debate has largely focused on the theoretical aspects of the \nanalysis as numerous critiques exist about the range of countries and regimes (see for \nexample, Leibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997;); the \nabsence of gender in the typology (see for example, Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Sainsbury, \n1994, 1999; Bambra, 2004), the analytical focus on cash benefits (Alber, 1995; Abrahamson, \n1999; Kautto, 2002; Bambra, 2005a; 2005b) and the creation of regimes that generalize about \nall forms of social policy provision from this base (Kasza, 2002; Bambra, 2005a). However, \nthe debate has also exposed the limitations of Esping-Andersen\u2019s methodology, particularly in \nrespect to the decommodification indexes. This led to the utilization of more statistically robust \nmethodologies (most notably cluster analysis), the results of which challenged the empirical \n 7 \naccuracy of the three-fold typology by identifying four or five different types of welfare state \n(see for example, Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Papadopoulos, 1998; Pitruzzello, 1999).  \n \nThe methodology that Esping-Andersen used to construct the decommodification indexes has \nmet with a degree of criticism. Attention has particularly been placed upon the additive nature \nof the indexes and the reliance upon averaging (Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, 1994; \nRagin, 1994; Pitruzello, 1999). Indeed, both these aspects minimise and simplify the impact of \nthe original variability within the raw data. Attention has also been drawn to the use of one \nstandard deviation around the mean to classify the countries into regimes, as this has a \nnoticeable impact on the classification of certain countries (Fawcett and Papadopoulos, \n1997), most notably the UK which if a different cut off point were used may not have fallen \nwithin the Liberal regime. Indeed, the classification of the UK as a Liberal regime country, \ngiven its borderline score of 23.4 (which is exactly the cut off point between the Liberal and \nConservative classifications) suggests that the a priori theoretical prediction of three regimes \nmay have influenced the choice of cut off point \u2013 the country classifications would not have \nbeen the same if two or three standard deviations around the mean were used (see Table 1). \nFurthermore, how Esping-Andersen operationalised the mean and standard deviation method \nmeant that it was impossible for any result other than a three-fold typology: regime \nclassification is either above (high\/Social Democratic), below (low\/Liberal), or between \n(medium\/Conservative) one standard deviation around the mean (Esping-Andersen, 1990: \n54). In this way a four fold, or five fold, etc classification of welfare states is methodologically \nimpossible. This suggests that the theoretical a priori choice of three regimes by Esping-\nAndersen unduly influenced the choice and development of the methodology used to \nempirically test their existence (Papadopoulos, 1998). \n \nVariable Weighting  \nHow this limited methodology was actually implemented by Esping-Andersen is also perhaps \none of the most important and influential aspects of the TWW typology. The methodology \nused to construct the decommodification indexes involved the weighting of certain key \nvariables (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 48-54). Firstly, the wage replacement rates received as \n 8 \ncompensation under the pension, unemployment and sickness benefit schemes were each \ngiven a double value. In each of the indexes there were two variables relating to replacement \nrates so this resulted in the combined value of replacement rates ranging from 4 (if the low \nscore of 1 was received for each of the two variables and doubled) to 12 (if the high score of 3 \nwas received for each of the two variables and doubled). The other two indicators measured \nin this way, for example in the case of the pensions index the contribution period required for \na standard pension and the individual\u2019s share of pension financing, only contributed between \n1 and 3 points each to the final decommodification score. In this way the indexes overly \nrepresent the role of replacement rates  (Fawcett and Papadopoulos, 1997).  \n \nThis weighting of replacement rates is justified by Esping-Andersen on the basis of their \nconsiderable importance in terms of \u2018people\u2019s welfare-work choices\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1990: \n54), decommodification, and enabling \u2018individuals and families to maintain a normal and \nsocially acceptable standard of living regardless of their market performance\u2019 (Esping-\nAndersen, 1987: 86). However, the other incidence of weighting in the indexes is less \njustifiable under the banner of decommodification. The last factor in each of the constituent \nindexes is the percent of the relevant population covered by the programme. This is used to \nweight the combined scores of the other four variables. It is therefore an extremely influential \nvariable and has a disproportionate impact on the total decommodification score of each \ncountry in each index: Countries with a high coverage rate but with low scores on the other \nvariables (such as the replacement rate variables) are rewarded, where as countries with \nlower coverage but more generous replacements rates are punished. This may perhaps seem \nintuitively to be fair \u2013 as Esping-Andersen himself argues, highly decommodifying welfare \nsystems that are only accessible by a minority offer little overall decommodification (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990: 49). This logic though is not applied to the case of Australia that, whilst \noffering high programme coverage via a means-tested system, is negatively scored (see \nEsping-Andersen, 1990: 54). This means that Australia\u2019s already low decommodification \nscores are further reduced by an arbitrary coverage rate of 50%. Evidently, it is acceptable for \nthe extent of programme coverage to be included in an index of decommodification but its \nparticular use as a weight is not adequately justified theoretically, empirically, or \n 9 \nmethodologically. The unique way in which the coverage variable is treated means that the \nindexes perhaps reflect coverage rates rather more than decommodification levels (Fawcett \nand Papadopoulos, 1997). \n \nTABLE 2 HERE PLEASE \n \nIt is not possible to explore the impact of the weighting on Esping-Andersen\u2019s original 1980 \ndecommodification scores but the updated decommodification data (presented according to \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s methodology \u2013 weighted - in Table 1) from 1998\/9 provides the \nopportunity to compare how treating the coverage variable in the same way as the other \nconstituent variables (i.e. using the mean and standard deviation scoring method of 1, 2 or 3) \nalters the individual country decommodification scores, the relative relationships of the \ncountries and the composition of the three regimes (Table 2). Table 2 shows the unweighted \nupdated decommodification scores for each of the three constituent indexes and for the \ncombined decommodification scores. The relative relationships of countries in Table 2 have \nchanged slightly compared to those in Table 1 (for example, the Netherlands moves from \ngroup 2 to group 3, Sweden is no longer the highest scorer) but what is perhaps the most \nnotable change is that in the range and scale of the scores: in the weighted data in Table 1 \nthe range is 11.5 to 34.7 and all the countries have unique decommodification values, where \nas in the unweighted data in Table 2 the range is 20 to 49 and several countries share the \nsame scores (for example, New Zealand and the UK both score 26, and the Netherlands and \nSweden 46). The differences between individual countries are a lot less stark and, without \nusing coverage as a weight, the whole decommodification index appears, at least \nsuperficially, to be a lot less sophisticated (all the scores are now whole numbers), \ncompelling, and robust. The original use of weighting may therefore have been to improve the \nlook and \u2018feel\u2019 of the data.  \n \nMiscalculations and Misclassifications \nCommentators, such as Leibfried (1992) or Bonoli (1997) in the case of Italy, Castles and \nMitchell (1993) in the case of the Antipodes, or Ginsburg (1992) in the case of the UK, have \n 10 \nremarked upon the possible misclassification of individual countries within the TWW typology. \nThis commentary has largely drawn on external theoretical or empirical evidence to support \nthe claims of misclassification. However, some instances of misclassification, most notably \nthat of the UK, can be highlighted using Esping-Andersen\u2019s own decommodification data. \nAside from the already touched upon issue of the UK\u2019s position directly on the cut off point \nbetween the Liberal and Conservative groupings, a miscalculation in the addition of the three \nconstituent decommodification scores (pensions, unemployment and sickness) of two \ncountries (Japan and the USA) resulted in the use of an erroneous mean and standard \ndeviation and the subsequent misclassification of three borderline countries: Japan in the \nmiddle (Conservative) decommodification group; and the UK and Ireland in the (Liberal) low \ndecommodification group.  \n \nTABLE 3 HERE PLEASE \n \nJapan scores 10.5 in the pensions index, 5.0 in the unemployment index and 6.8 in the \nsickness index (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 50; and reproduced in Table 1). This amounts to an \noverall total decommodification score of 22.3. However, in his combined decommodification \nTable (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 52; and reproduced in Table 1) Esping-Andersen gives Japan \na combined score of 27.1, an increase of 4.8. The opposite error is made in the case of the \nUSA. It scores a total of 14.2, 7.0 in the pensions index, 0 in the sickness index and 7.2 in the \nunemployment index (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 50; and reproduced in Table 1). However, in \nthe combined decommodification Table (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 52; and reproduced in Table \n1) the presented USA score is 13.8. These calculation errors immediately impact upon the \nclassification of Japan as a score of 22.3 places it firmly within the Liberal decommodification \ngroup, between Canada and Ireland (Table 1). However, the effects of the miscalculations are \nfar more extensive than this, as the mean and standard deviation used by Esping-Andersen \nto classify all 18 countries on the basis on their combined decommodification scores is \ninformed by the mistaken Japanese and USA scores. Table 3 compares Esping-Andersen\u2019s \noriginal combined decommodification calculation of the mean and standard deviation with the \nrecalculations. It shows that the mean decreases from 27.2 to 26.9 and the standard deviation \n 11 \nincreases from 7.7 to 7.8. Although the changes are only slight they do have an influence on \nhow the countries are classified. Previously the cut off point for the Liberal regime was below \n23.4 whereas with the recalculation it is below 23. This means that as mentioned Japan (22.3) \nfalls into the Liberal regime, and both the UK (23.4) and Ireland (23.3) are reclassified out of \nthe Liberal group and into the Conservative group. This fundamentally undermines the a priori \nassumptions about the composition of the three different welfare state models and casts \nfurther aspersions upon how, and indeed why, the indexes were constructed and combined in \nthis manner. \n \nDecommodification Revisited \nThese problems in methodology, calculation and classification cause considerable difficulties \nin presenting the updated decommodification index and comparing and contrasting it with \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s work.   \n \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s typology was originally published in 1990, but the labour market data upon \nwhich it was based was from 1980 (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 50). The updated data from \nwhich the new index is calculated is from 1998\/9 (Bambra, in press). An initial comparison of \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s original data and the updated data (Table 1) provides evidence of change, \nboth in terms of the slight decrease in average total decommodification from 27.2 in 1980 to \n25.7 in 1998\/9, and the change in the relative relationships and group membership of the \ncountries: Canada\u2019s improved ranking places it in the medium group, Switzerland, France and \nFinland similarly move up a group to the high decommodification grouping, whereas the \nrelative decommodification levels of the Netherlands and Denmark fall and they are in the \nmedium group in the new index. Indeed, only Sweden maintains the same rank position \n(highest scorer) in each of the indexes as the rank order of all of the other countries differs.  \n \nThere are however, some similarities between the indexes, most notably the sustained \nposition of the Norway and Sweden as two of the most highly decommodifying states, Italy \nand Germany in the medium decommodifying group and Australia, New Zealand and the USA \nin the low decommodifying group. In light of the previous discussions it should also be noted \n 12 \nthat the recalculated 1980 data (Table 3) shows slightly less change both in terms of the \nreduced decrease in average total decommodification (26.9 to 25.7) and the positioning of \ncertain countries, most notably Japan in the low group and Ireland in the medium group.   \n \nNonetheless, the overarching message from the new data is one of fragmentation, the three \nworlds have not remained static and there has been considerable movement in the relative \nrelationships of the constituent countries. However, due to the manner in which the original \nindex and, through its methodological replication, the updated index, were designed it is \ndifficult to draw any firm empirically based conclusions about the broader meaning of the \nchanges in decommodification and individual country scores. It is not possible, due to the way \nin which the majority of variable scoring is based upon the relative position of a country\u2019s \nvalue in regard to the overall mean value for a variable, to comment usefully on changes in \nindividual country scores. For example, the raw data value of one country may have remained \nrelatively stable overtime for a particular variable, such as replacement rates, but if the overall \nmean for that factor has increased their decommodification index score of 1, 2 or 3 for that \nvariable may actually decrease or increase. A comparison of the two indexes therefore can \nonly show differences in the relative decommodification relationships between countries \nrather than any change in absolute decommodification values. \n \nConclusion \nThis research note has discussed the theoretical, empirical and methodological limitations of \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s index and taken the opportunity presented by the updated \ndecommodification data to explore the specific issue of weighting in each of the constituent \ndecommodification indexes. This has suggested that the indexes may not in fact be analysing \ndecommodification but rather programme coverage rates and this has implications for how \nthe typology is interpreted. Furthermore, an overlooked error in Esping-Andersen\u2019s original \ncalculations has been revealed and the resulting incorrect positioning of three countries \u2013 \nJapan, the UK and Ireland has been highlighted. Taken together with the other \nmethodological criticisms already present within the welfare state modelling literature, these \npoints have undermined the original intentions behind revisiting and updating the TWW \n 13 \ndecommodification index. It has been shown that only the relative relationships between the \ncountries can be examined. There is evidence, however, despite these limitations, that the \nrelative positioning of the countries has changed quite considerably and that the TWW are no \nlonger, at least in terms of decommodification, an empirical reality. Indeed, the \nmethodological nuances and overt miscalculations identified in the original index raise \nquestions about the extent to which the TWW typology ever actually existed at all.  Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s analysis was overtly theoretically informed a priori, but the decommodification \nindex data was presented as a taxonomy that broadly supported the theory of three different \ntypes of welfare state. This was perhaps a mistake and whilst at the theoretical level, the main \ntenants of the TWW decommodification model may still exist (Esping-Andersen, 1999) at the \nempirical level the updated data suggests that the model can no longer be supported.   \n \nLimitations \nThe updated decommodification index replicated Esping-Andersen\u2019s method as closely as \npossible but there were some inconsistencies in data availability (for more details see \nBambra, 2005b). It should be noted that Esping-Andersen\u2019s TWW typology was based on \nmore than just the decommodification indexes; stratification and the private-public mix were \nalso considered. These aspects would also have to be recalculated before a judgement could \nbe made on the overall empirical robustness of the TWW. The updated index is therefore not \nentirely comparative to the original TWW, but it is indicative. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author gratefully acknowledges the insightful comments of two anonymous referees. \n 14 \nReferences \nAbrahamson, P.
