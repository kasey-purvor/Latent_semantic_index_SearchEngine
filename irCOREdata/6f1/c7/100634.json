The calculations show that, with increasing neu-\ntron number in the Z>40 nuclides, nuclear shapes evolve from prolate, through triaxial to oblate deformations.\nIn contrast to other regions of the nuclear chart, pronounced oblate shapes dominate the collective rotation\nfrom ground states to very high spins (I;40), when N>70. The stability of the oblate shapes is due to the\nsimultaneous upper-shell neutron and proton Fermi surfaces, reinforced by the rotation alignment behavior of\nboth nucleon types. Configuration-constrained calculations predict the coexistence of well-deformed prolate\nand oblate multiquasiparticle ~isomeric! states.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.65.021303 PACS number~s!: 21.60.Cs, 21.10.Re, 27.60.1jIt is rare for nuclear ground states to have oblate defor-\nmations, and recent observations of nuclides in the A\u201980\nand 190 regions near the proton drip line have led to renewed\ninterest in the stability of oblate shapes @1\u20136#. Although co-\nexisting oblate and prolate shapes have been observed in\nthese proton-rich A\u201980 and 190 regions, the collective rota-\ntion of the oblate structures is usually not favored energeti-\ncally in competition with prolate configurations ~due to a\nlower moment of inertia for collective oblate rotation!. Also,\nthe oblate shapes are generally soft @7,8#, and they become\nunstable with increasing rotational spin. Perhaps the only\nexceptions are a few of the A\u2019190 mercury and platinum\nisotopes, where the oblate deformation, however, is very\nsmall @9#. It remains, therefore, an interesting question as to\nwhether there exist well-deformed, oblate ground states that\ncontinue to be energetically favored under rotation.\nThe importance of oblate shapes is not only due to their\nrare occurrence and different behavior, but also there is a\ndirect link to the properties of the nuclear mean field. A\nrecent paper has analyzed the properties of the Nilsson po-\ntential to explain the observation that about 86% of nuclides\nare prolate @10#. The authors also pointed out that the pro-\nportion of prolate and oblate nuclides is sensitive to the de-\ntailed form of the potential and provides a crucial test of the\nstrength of the spin-orbit force @10#. Since the isospin depen-\ndence of the spin-orbit force is still not well established, the\nobservation of a region of nuclei with stable oblate shapes\nwould form an interesting testing ground for mean-field\nmodels. From the systematics of observed rotational bands, it\nis clear that the filling of oblate favoring single-particle lev-\nels is not enough to result in oblate shapes. Other require-\nments are necessary, such as deformed shell gaps and\/or\nrotational-alignment effects.\nIn this Rapid Communication, we investigate neutron-rich\nA\u2019110 nuclides, with Fermi surfaces in the upper halves of\nthe Z528250 and N550282 shells, approximately 40<Z\n<46 and 66<N<76. Skalski et al. @11# have performed glo-\nbal shape calculations that already indicate oblate shapes in\nthis A\u2019110 region, though with limited consideration of the\ntriaxiality degree of freedom and limited discussion of the0556-2813\/2002\/65~2!\/021303~5!\/$20.00 65 0213collective oblate rotation. We now investigate this region in\nmore detail, including for the first time the diabatic calcula-\ntion of multiquasiparticle ~multi-qp! configurations.\nBefore presenting the detailed calculations, we also like to\nmention the importance of these neutron-rich A\u2019110 nu-\nclides in nuclear astrophysics. These nuclides approach the\nr-process ~rapid neutron capture process! path that is defined\nby the equilibrium between neutron capture and photodisin-\ntegration. Neutron capture terminates when the neutron sepa-\nration energies are about 2 MeV, i.e., about 15220 mass\nunits away from the valley of stability @12#. Beta decays then\ndrive the neutron-rich nuclei towards the line of b stability.\nCalculated half-lives crucially depend on mass calculations,\nwhich in turn are sensitive to the shape degrees of freedom.\nAbout half of the A.60 nuclei observed in nature were pro-\nduced in the r process. The solar elemental abundance peaks\nnear A580,130, and 195 correspond to the neutron shell\nclosures of N550,82, and 126, respectively. Theoretically,\nthe modeling of astrophysical processes relies heavily on the\nstructure knowledge of r-process nuclides.\nExperimentally, some r-process nuclides can now be\nreached with modern facilities. Using the projectile fission of\nuranium at relativistic energies, for example, very neutron-\nrich isotopes with N\/Z\u21921.8 in the A\u2019110 region, e.g.,\n110Zr, 114Mo, 119Ru, and 124Pd, have been identified @13#.\nFor 40<Z<46, the heaviest even-even isotopes with known\nexcited states are 104Zr @14#, 108Mo @15#, 114Ru @16#, and\n118Pd @17#. As the nuclei become more neutron rich, experi-\nmental measurements are usually more difficult due to the\nlower production cross sections. In these cases, isomeric\nstates could be of advantage, since decays from isomers can\nprovide useful structure information. Isomerism is also im-\nportant for astrophysical processes, because the existence of\nisomers can affect the r process @18#. In the present work, we\nfocus on the theoretical understanding of extreme neutron-\nrich A\u2019110 nuclides near the r-process path. Both\ncollective-rotational and multi-qp states are studied.\nThe nonaxial deformed Woods-Saxon ~WS! potential @19#\nis employed.

The monopole pairing\nstrength G is determined by the average-gap method @20#,\nand quadrupole pairing strengths are obtained by restoring\nthe Galilean invariance broken by the seniority pairing force\n@21#. To avoid the spurious phase transition encountered in\nthe BCS approach, we use approximate particle-number pro-\njection ~Lipkin-Nogami pairing @23#!. Pairing correlations\nare dependent on the rotational frequency (v) and deforma-\ntion. In order to include such dependence in the TRS, we\nhave performed pairing-deformation-frequency self-\nconsistent TRS calculations, i.e., for any given deformation\nand frequency, pairings are self-consistently calculated by\nthe HFB-like method @23#. At a given frequency, the defor-\nmation of a state is determined by minimizing the calculated\nTRS.\nFigure 1 displays the calculated single-particle levels of\nthe Woods-Saxon potential. It can be determined that the\nneutrons and protons have reinforcing effects that favor ob-\nlate shapes, for the nuclides that have the neutron and proton\nFermi surfaces in the upper halves of the N550282 and Z\n528250 shells, approximately 70<N,82 and 40<Z,50.\nWe now consider the results of the shape calculations in\nmore detail.

When N>72, oblate shapes become yrast and\nthese oblate shapes remain stable upto very high spins (I\n;40). Figure 2 ~left! shows calculated TRS\u2019s for 112Zr (N\n572). For the Z542 molybdenum isotopes, 108Mo (N\n566) has a g-soft triaxial minimum around b2\u20190.3 and\nugu\u201920\u00b0. With increasing rotational frequency, a collective\ng\u2019220\u00b0 minimum becomes deeper, while the less-\ncollective g\u2019120\u00b0 minimum disappears gradually. In\n110Mo (N568) the minimum becomes more oblate. For N\n>70, the molybdenum isotopes have oblate minima around\nb2\u20190.22, and approaching the N582 shell closure, the ob-\nlate deformations become smaller. Neutron-rich Z544 ruthe-\nnium isotopes have similar deformation evolution to the mo-\nlybdenum isotopes. The nuclei 110,112Ru (N566,68) are\ntriaxially soft, corresponding to the observation of very low\n22\n1 g-vibrational states around 112Ru @16#. The generalized-\ncollective-model calculations also showed the soft triaxiality\n@24#, and Nazarewicz et al. @25# emphasize the importance of\nthis region of triaxiality. Heavier ruthenium isotopes (N\n>70), however, have oblate ~or approximately oblate!\nshapes. As we are interested in the stable oblate shapes, two\nmore examples, 112Mo and 114Ru, are also shown in Fig. 2.\nThere are similar deformations for neutron-rich palladium\nisotopes. Since the palladium proton number of Z546 is\ncloser to the magic number of Z550, these isotopes are in\ngeneral softer in shape.\nCompared to the A\u201980 and 190 regions, neutron-rich A\n\u2019110 nuclei have more stable oblate shapes. We calculate\nthat the oblate structure can stay yrast up to at least \\v\n\u20191.0 MeV ~corresponding to I\u201936, see Fig. 2!. The oblate\nminima become in general deeper ~stiffer! with increasing\nrotational frequency. This type of rotational enhancement of\noblate stability has also been calculated in the upper half of\nthe N5822126, Z550282 shell, e.g., in neutron-rich\nhafnium isotopes where Z572 and N\u2019110 @26,27#. How-\never, the hafnium isotopes have prolate ground states. Nev-\nertheless, for high spins ~approximately I.20) collective ob-\nlate states become lower in energy than the collective prolate\nstates. It was found that the appearance of hafnium oblate\nshapes is mainly due to the rotational alignments of both the\ni13\/2 neutrons and the h11\/2 protons. For the A\u2019110 region,\nthe Fermi surface of the N\u201972 neutrons locates in the top\nregion of the neutron h11\/2 subshell, where the Coriolis effect\nis strong due to the oblate low-K ~or intermediate-K) high-j\nfeature. Therefore, the oblate-favoring rotational effect\nshould be expected. The calculations show that one pair of\nh11\/2 neutrons aligns at \\v\u20190.3 MeV(I\u201912). Further, due\nto the corresponding location of the Z\u201944 ~oblate! Fermi\nsurface, two g9\/2 protons align around \\v\u20190.5 MeV. At\n\\v.1.0 MeV, b2\u20190.45 prolate superdeformed bands are\ncalculated to become lower in energy, which has also been\nshown in Refs. @11,28#.

For\nN>68 nuclides in this mass region, no conclusions regarding\nshapes have been made experimentally, though rotational\nbands have been observed for heavy ruthenium isotopes\n1082114Ru (N564270) @16#. As discussed above, we calcu-\nlate that 1082112Ru have g-soft triaxial deformations and\n114Ru is g-soft oblate at low spins ~see Fig. 2!. The calcu-\nlated results show also that 1082112Ru have almost the same\nvalues of bandhead moment of inertia, J (1)\u201918\\2 MeV,\nand 114Ru has J (1)\u201914\\2 MeV. From the data @16#, J (1)\n\u201913\\2 MeV for 1082112Ru and 11\\2 MeV for 114Ru. We\ncan see a striking decrease in the J (1) value between\n1082112Ru and 114Ru in both theory and experiment. This\ncould be a signal for the deformation change which is seen in\nour calculations, but additional observables are needed to\nestablish the actual shapes.\nThe calculations give in general larger moments of inertia\nand earlier backbendings than observed experimentally. This\nis related to the choice of the pairing strength G. In our\nprevious work @30#, it was found that moments of inertia and\nbackbendings are very sensitive to the ~neutron and proton!\nG values used. In the average gap method @20#, which is used\nin the present work, the G values are determined by fitting\nexperimental odd-even mass differences with the average\npairing gap. However, it has been shown that the mean field\nitself gives contributions to odd-even mass differences @30\u2013\n33#. The inclusion of the mean-field effect can lead to a\nslight adjustment in the G values, e.g., about a 5210 % in-02130crease in the A\u2019180 region @30,33#. The adjusted G values\nin that case gave improved and consistent descriptions, at the\nsame time, for moments of inertia, backbendings, and quasi-\nparticle excitation energies @30,33#. In the present case, a\nsmall increase in the G values would significantly lower the-\noretical moments of inertia and delay backbendings, and\nhence improve the agreement with experimental data. How-\never, this kind of adjustment of the G values requires accu-\nrate nuclear masses. In the present work, we have not at-\ntempted to modify the G values, since a small G adjustment\ndoes not influence deformations @30,33#. In triaxial cases,\ne.g., in 1082112Ru, two- or three-dimensional cranking could\nimprove the calculations further.\nIsomerism can be important for both astrophysics and\nnuclear structure. The existence of isomeric states can affect\nthe r process path @18#. In addition, isomers can provide\npossibilities to observe excited states of nuclei far from sta-\nbility ~see, for example, Ref. @34#!. The configuration-\nconstrained method @33# has been used for the potential-\nenergy-surface ~PES! calculations of multi-qp states. In this\nmethod, the orbitals involved in a given configuration are\nidentified and diabatically blocked by calculating the average\nNilsson numbers of the orbitals @33#. The shape and excita-\ntion energy of a multi-qp state can be obtained from the\nconfiguration-constrained PES. It is well known that an axial\ndeformation and high-K value provide good conditions for\nthe formation of isomeric states @35#.

Our calculations show prolate 42 states,\nwith b2\u20190.35 and Eex\u20191.3 MeV. The calculated energies\nare lower than the experimental values. This is also related to\nthe G value, as discussed above in the calculation of mo-\nments of inertia. The excitation energy of a multi-qp state is\nvery sensitive to the G value @33# ~note that G is model\ndependent!. About an 8% increase in the neutron G value can\nreproduce the energies of the observed 42 isomers. This is\nalso consistent with the requirement for reproducing the mo-\nments of inertia.\nWe have made a search for a variety of possible multi-qp\nstates in the neutron-rich A\u2019110 region. In heavy molybde-\nnum, ruthenium, and palladium isotopes, the TRS calcula-\ntions show no prolate minima, and, correspondingly, no pro-\nlate multi-qp states have been found in these nuclei by\nperforming configuration-constrained PES calculations.

For these nonrotational\nstates, the PES\u2019s are reflection symmetric about\nthe g50\u00b0 and 260\u00b0 axes.3-4\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nOBLATE STABILITY OF A\u2019110 NUCLEI NEAR THE r-PROCESS PATH PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 021303~R!neutrons aligns at \\v\u20190.3 MeV, and a pair of g9\/2 protons\naligns at \\v\u20190.5 MeV. The stability of the oblate shapes is\ndue to the simultaneous upper-shell neutron and proton\nFermi surfaces, reinforced by the rotation-alignment behav-\nior of both nucleon types. Although, classically, the moment\nof inertia for an oblate shape is smaller than for a prolate\nshape, the specific quantum nature of the atomic nucleus\nresults here in larger moments of inertia for oblate shapes,\ndue to specific quasiparticle alignments. Possible low-energy\nprolate and oblate multi-qp states are also predicted.\nNegative-parity two-quasineutron states in 1102114Zr have02130large prolate deformations around b2\u20190.35. The n 92 @514#\n^\n1\n2 @420# , Kp552 states in the N566 isotones are oblate\ndeformed with b2\u20190.25, and, especially if isomeric, may be\nobservable experimentally.\nThis work was supported by the U.K. Royal Society.\nF.R.X. acknowledges support from the Major State Basic\nResearch Development Program of China ~G2000077400!,\nthe Chinese Ministry of Education, and Peking University.\nR.W. thanks the Swedish Science Council.@1# S.M.
