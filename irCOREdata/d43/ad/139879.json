High temperature erosion-oxidation\nis a major cause of wear in both fluidised bed combustors and gas turbines and much effort has\nbeen put into understanding the phenomena and reducing wear rates. A number of different\nerosion-oxidation mechanisms have been proposed over the years to describe the different wear\nregimes, some of these mechanisms are discussed in this paper, as well as the mapping\ntechniques that have been used to quantify wastage rates. Finally, erosion-oxidation modelling\nis discussed, starting with models that combine oxidation kinetics with erosion rate equations\nthat lead to predictive models before concentrating on Monte Carlo modelling methods.\n1. Introduction\nErosion affects numerous industries, such as power generation, mining and the pneumatic\ntransportation of solids, while the marine, oil and gas, chemical and power generation industries\nare all primarily affected by corrosion and oxidation and to a lesser extent erosion. But the\nworst case scenarios normally occur where there is a combination of both erosion and corrosion\nor oxidation especially in the cases of erosion and high temperature oxidation as in gas turbine\nengines and fluidised bed combustors (FBCs). There are occasions when oxidation can reduce\nthe degree of materials loss by such wear processes by forming a stable\nprotective oxide layer, often referred to as an oxide glaze, but more often than not the\ncombination results in excessively high wear rates. In order to understand the interactions\nbetween the two processes it is necessary to have an understanding of both processes on their\nown before trying to predict how they behave in combination.\nThis paper gives a succinct overview of erosion mechanisms and oxidation kinetics before\ndiscussing erosion-oxidation (E-O) mechanisms, maps and models. The two main industries\nthat triggered the research into E-O are FBCs and gas turbines, both of which operate at\nopposite ends of the E-O spectrum. FBCs operate under high particle fluxes and low velocities\n1-10m\/s while gas turbine engines operate at low particle fluxes but high impact velocities (in\nthe region of 300m\/s).\n2. Basic Erosion Mechanisms\nErosion mechanisms can be broadly divided into two main categories: ductile erosion and\nbrittle erosion. The major difference between the two erosion mechanisms becomes obvious\nwhen comparing the erosion rate at different angles of impact. In the erosion of ductile\nmaterials the maximum erosion rate is usually found to occur at an impact angle of between 30\nand 60 degrees, while in brittle materials this will occur at approximately 90\u00b0 impact.\n2.1 Impact damage in ductile materials\nThe erosion of soft, tough materials is predominantly ductile and material loss can occur in two\ndifferent ways: cutting wear due to impact at low angles [1], and extrusion at high angles.\nFragmentation of the impacting particles can occur at normal or near-normal impact angles,\ngiving rise to secondary erosion [2]. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and\nerosion of ductile materials is essentially a combination of the two processes, with one being\ndominant over the other depending on impact angle and material properties and particle\nproperties and shape.\n2.2 Cutting wear\nDuctile erosion reaches a maximum at a particular angle for a given system, usually between 30\nand 60\u00b0, due to cutting wear. The impacting particle removes material by chip formation,\nessentially scraping material off the surface of the solid in a manner similar to machining [1].\n2.3 Extrusion and Fragmentation\nWhen the eroding particle strikes the surface of a ductile material at or near 90\u00b0 the material is\nextruded to the edge of the damage zone to form lips that will then be vulnerable to subsequent\nimpacts [2][3]. These subsequent impacts will cause further deformation, extrusion and work\nhardening, until fracture occurs and the material is completely lost from the surface. A\nsecondary stage can also occur when the impacting particles are brittle and fracture on impact,\nresulting in further secondary impact damage at a reduced velocity and lower impact angles.\nThere are many papers available in the literature which deal with calculating and modelling the\nwear rates of ductile materials[ 1,3-5].\n2.4 Impact damage in brittle materials\nMaterial loss in solid particle erosion of brittle materials occurs predominantly through the\nformation and interaction of a subsurface microcrack network. In order for these cracks to\ndevelop, the surface stresses must reach a critical value to initiate microcracking. When these\ncracks propagate and intersect with the surface, material is lost [1,6-9]. Hence for a brittle\nmaterial the erosion resistance is a function of its fracture toughness and its resistance to crack\ninitiation.\nThe modes of deformation and fracture depend on the particle velocity, shape, and its\nmechanical properties relative to those of the target material [1,10-12]. Blunt particles travelling\nat low velocities set up hertzian stress fields in the target, which initiate cone cracking, while\nangular particles travelling at high velocities produce inelastic deformation zones and initiate\nmedian and lateral cracking [13].\n2.5 Median \/ Lateral cracking\nWhen eroding brittle materials with relatively hard or incompressible particles the target is\nplastically deformed and two primary types of fracture can occur. Median cracks propagate\ndownward from the contact zone, and lateral cracks develop below the contact zone and\npropagate parallel to the surface, eventually curving up towards the surface [6]. These cracks\nexhibit some similarities to the median and lateral cracks observed during quasi-static\nindentation [14].\nLawn and Swain [14] have described the loading sequence for a sharp indenter in the following\nway. An initial zone of irreversible deformation, which increases with increasing load, is\ninduced around the sharp indenter. Once a critical load has been reached, a crack will initiate\nunder the contact point where the stress concentration is greatest. This crack is called the\nmedian vent and on initial unloading it will begin to close but does not heal. Relaxation of the\ndeformed material within the contact zone, just prior to removal of the indenter,\nsuperimposes intense residual tensile stresses upon the applied field. This in turn causes the\ninitiation of sideways extending cracks called lateral cracks. On complete unloading the lateral\ncrack continues to grow and can intersect the surface, causing material loss [14-17]. Material\nloss occurs due to intersection of lateral cracks with the surface as well as interaction with other\ncracks.\n2.6 Hertzian cracking\nWhen a blunt elastic particle impacts on a brittle material, which remains elastic until fracture\noccurs, Hertzian cone cracks will develop. Material removal will depend on the propagation of\nthe fracture into the material and its interaction with other fractures.\nOn initial loading, a compressive field is set up directly beneath the indenter, with a tensile\nstress outside the expanding contact circle. As the tensile stress increases the stage is reached\nwhere an inherent surface flaw in the material is subjected to sufficient tensile stress to initiate\ncrack propagation. This crack will then propagate around the area of contact to form a ring\ncrack, which will extend downwards out of the surface region. As loading increases, tensile\nstresses develop until the ring crack spontaneously develops into a full cone crack. On\nunloading, the cone crack will attempt to close and heal in order to recover some of the stored\nelastic energy but is prevented from doing so by the mechanical obstruction of debris. If the\nunloading is rapid enough, the base of the cone may turn up in a hat brim fashion and could\nintersect the surface [1,18].\n3. Erosion-Oxidation\nThe big question is what happens when both erosion and oxidation are combined. It all depends\non the oxidation kinetics of the system being investigated, i.e. fast growth (e.g. NiO) or slow\ngrowth (e.g. Cr2O3) oxide, temperature, whether the oxide is protective, its mechanical\nproperties and the erosion conditions. First consider the fundamentals of oxide growth.\n3.1 Oxidation and Oxide Growth from an Erosion Perspective\nOxidation is a thermochemical process. That is all metals, when exposed at high temperature,\nmove towards a thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment. This manifests itself, for\nmost structural materials, in the growth of a surface oxide scale. In alloy systems there is\ncompetition between the various alloy constituents which gives rise to selective oxidation, the\nformation of multilayered scales, internal oxidation and other more complex bioxidant\noxidation reactions.\nWith such a thermodynamic background in mind, for alloy systems, one initially observes the\nformation of a \u2018transient oxide\u2019 on an exposed metallic alloy surface. The transient oxide\nusually contains stable oxide species of all the oxidisable elements in the alloy. Competition\nbetween the growth of these species usually leads to the formation of some protective oxide, be\nit alumina, chromia or an iron-chromium spinel, depending on the alloy being oxidised. This is\nthe desirable service condition, with components protected by a stable, slow growing surface\noxide. The kinetics of this has been well researched for many alloy systems, with protective\noxide growth following parabolic or sub-parabolic kinetics. Problems are\nencountered when this oxide scale is damaged, be it due to ballistic impaction, erosion,\nmechanical stressing, or thermal cycling, when non protective oxidation may ensue leading to\nthicker oxide scales and faster oxidation rates.\nThe onset and extent of such mechanically induced failures depends primarily on interplay\nbetween three factors:\ni) defects, such as voids, pores and microcracks that develop in the scale as it grows [19-23].\nii)stresses that act on the scale. These may result from impact events, but are supplemented by\nthose generated due to oxide growth and due to thermally induced transients within the system\nunder evaluation. The influences of such stresses will be locally concentrated by the defects in\nthe scale.\niii) stress relief within the oxide scale\/substrate system can limit the extent of such\nmechanical failures of the oxide scale. This occurs primarily by plastic deformation of the near\nsurface region, while at temperature . From an erosion-oxidation perspective this stress relief\nhas a significant influence on the boundary between \u2018oxide modified\u2019 and \u2018substrate dominated\u2019\nerosion, using the terminology of Stephenson and Nicholls [24].\nThe interaction between these three factors, and how they depend on the impact event, will\ndetermine when scale failure occurs. The mechanically damaged scale can be healed by\nforming a new oxide - this involves both the transient oxidation and protective growth stages \u2013\nand the relative times between this oxide loss, healing and re-growth process dictates the\nobserved erosion-oxidation regime.\nOne final point, continued impact, scale spallation and re-growth, will lead to depletion of\noxide forming elements from within the near surface region of the alloy. This will have an\ninfluence on the type of oxide formed, its mechanical properties and the mechanical properties\nof the underlying alloy. These time dependent phenomena further complicate the\nmodelling\/prediction of erosion-oxidation. For example FeCrAlY steels produce an adherent\nalumina scale when the Al content in the near surface region is above 2wt%, below this it forms\nchromia scales and finally base metal oxides these scales are less adherent and less protective\nthan alumina.\n3.2 Erosion-Oxidation Mechanisms\nOver the years, particularly in the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s, there has been a lot of research\nconducted on high temperature erosion [25-43], with most of the work concentrating on\nstainless steels, nickel based superalloys and titanium alloys, although some work was also\nconducted on ceramics.\nThere have been a number of different approaches used to deal with and quantify the erosion\noxidation problem. These include lab testing of various types - a review of which has been\npublished by Nicholls [44] - in situ testing [45,46] and various modelling [24,47-50] and\nmapping techniques [51,52], which will all be discussed in the following sections.\nThere are a number of factors that have been found to influence the E-O of materials which\ninclude, particle size, velocity, density, angularity and hardness, the time between impacts\n(particle flux) as well as the angle of impact and of course the oxidation kinetics, which is\naffected by the temperature and the alloy composition. Hogmark [53] stated that in order to\ncharacterise the E-O of a material one needed to know the following:\n\uf0b7 The oxidation properties of the base metal.\n\uf0b7 The erosion properties of the base metal.\n\uf0b7 The erosion properties of the oxide layer.\n\uf0b7 The erosion properties of the base metal coated with an oxide layer.\nThe oxidation properties of the base metal combined with the flux of the erodent will determine\nthe thickness of the oxide that is formed; the velocity and size of the particles will also have an\ninfluence. Thus Barkalow and Pettit[54] defined E-O in terms of the kinetic energy of the\nimpacting particles and scale growth rate identifying various regimes as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe erosion properties of the oxide layer become important when the impact energy and the\nparticle flux are both sufficiently low that the oxide grows to a sufficient thickness that the\nimpact event is totally contained within the oxide layer and is not affected by the substrate. The\nerosion properties of the base layer coated with an oxide layer become important when the\noxide layer is not thick enough to contain the whole impact event and the substrate as well as the\noxide is deformed. The combination of these different factors led to the need to define different\nerosion regimes\/mechanisms relating to particle size, flux and velocity and oxide\/substrate\ninteractions.\nMost researchers have divided the erosion-oxidation process into four or six different regimes\nranging from pure erosion on one side to pure oxidation on the other with various intermediate\nregimes. Some of the proposed regimes are summarised in table 1.\nLaboratory testing seemed to indicate that there was a distinct erosion-corrosion response to\ntemperature, with wastage rates increasing with an increase in temperature to some peak\ntemperature before starting to decrease with a further increase in temperature [29] as illustrated\nin Figure 2 [40]. This was different to the findings from in situ testing in FBC\u2019s where E-O\nwastage was found to decrease with an increase temperature after a critical temperature was\npassed, as illustrated in Figure 3. This \u2018anomaly\u2019 was attributed to the fact that in laboratory\ntesting the specimens where not internally cooled, as is the case for heat exchanger tubes.\nThese findings prompted the modifications to the erosion-corrosion test rig at Cambridge to\nenable it to test internally cooled specimens [28], which would be more representative of the\nactual conditions with in a fluidized bed combustor. It was found that specimens tested under\nisothermal conditions showed a maximum wastage rate at intermediate temperatures ( about 3\n50\u00b0C), while those tested with internal cooling exhibited maximum wastage rates in the region\nof 200\u00b0C, which is similar to that experienced in FBCs as illustrated in Figure 3. It was\nproposed that internal cooling of the specimens caused the isothermal erosion-corrosion curve\nto broaden, shifting the maximum wastage rates to lower temperatures.\nOver the years different E-O regimes have been observed under various conditions by different\nresearches, Sethi et al [29] described the E-O regions as low- intermediate- and high-\ntemperature regimes, similar to Stack\u2019s erosion dominated, erosion-corrosion dominated and\ncorrosion dominated regimes [40]. Stephenson and Nicholls [24] termed these regimes substrate\ndominated, oxide modified and oxide dominated erosion in their work on various alloys.\nEssentially most of the proposed mechanisms are similar, if not identical and will now be\ndiscussed in more detail. In the first of these regimes where the oxide scale is very thin the\nerosion rate is relatively insensitive to increases in temperature and depends mainly on the\nproperties of the base metal - substrate dominated erosion. However, as the temperature\nincreases the second regime is entered and the erosion rate increases due to the formation and\neasy removal of the oxide scale - oxide modified erosion. Here the erosion rate is dependent on\nthe properties of the composite oxide\/substrate, the ease with which the scale is removed and\nthe oxidation kinetics. The third regime is where the oxide forms sufficiently quickly and is\nthick enough that the impact of particles does not expose the base metal. Thus only oxide is\nremoved during impacts - oxide dominated erosion. The temperatures at which these various\nregimes operate depend on a number of factors, which include particle size, velocity and flux as\nwell as the composition of the alloy, which influences oxidation rates.\nRishel\u2019s description is very similar to that of Stephenson\u2019s but includes three different erosion\nenhanced corrosion regimes, illustrated in Figure 5. Type III, which is the same as the oxide\nmodified regime proposed by Stephenson, involving spallation of the oxide. In type I and type\nII the thickness of the oxide is reduced due to erosion and hence the rate of oxidation increases\ncompared to pure oxidation also cracks caused by the impacting particles facilitate the diffusion\nof oxygen to the metal surface further increasing the oxidation rate.\nThere are a few other factors affecting E-O that need to be mentioned here, namely alloy\ncontent and oxide morphology. If the oxide forms a segmented scale the E-O wastage rate per\nimpact is limited by the crystallite size. However, if a thick continuous oxide is formed each\nimpact will be able to remove more material resulting in a higher wastage rate [61]. It\nhas been shown that Si additions to low Cr steels reduces the E-O wastage rate due to the\nformation of a segmented oxide scale [62] as opposed to a continuous oxide scale.\nAs can be seen from Figure 6 the alloy content can shift the E-O trend depending on whether\nthe material becomes more or less corrosion resistant. However, these effects are not always\nobserved and this \u201ctypical response\u201d is dependent on whether the oxide formed is coherent and\nadherent and the point at which it will spall. In the case of non-protective oxides erosion-\ncorrosion rates will increase dramatically as the temperature increases, since the third regime\ncan not be attained. Levy [61] showed that increasing the Cr content (in Cr containing alloys)\nreduced the E-O wastage rate and that at the conditions used (850\u00b0C, 35 m\/s, 130 \u00b5m Al2O3) the\nmechanism changed from oxidation controlled erosion to oxidation affected erosion in the\nregion of 15% Cr.\n3.3 Erosion-Oxidation Mapping\nErosion-oxidation mapping (E-O maps) and more recently erosion-corrosion (aqueous)\nmapping (E-C maps) have become a popular way in which to represent the way in which a\nsystem will behave under different E-O and E-C conditions. E-O maps can be plotted in a\nnumber of different ways. Stephenson and Nicholls [24] plotted particle velocity vs oxide\nthickness for a specific particle size and temperature, while Stack [38] plotted velocity vs\ntemperature. In both cases contours indicate the different regimes of E-O wastage, which\ntranslate into regions of high, medium and low mass loss as shown in the following figures. As\nthe following diagrams indicate, E-O maps are useful to determine what will happen when\nconditions change, ie if flux or velocity increase or if there is a change in oxidation kinetics\ndue to a change in alloy, the different mechanisms operating and the rough position of\nboundaries between each of the mechanisms.\nAs can be seen in Figure 7 and Figure 8 as the velocity increase so does the temperature\nassociated with the change in the E-O regime. While from Figure 8 (when compared to Figure\n7) an increase in oxidation rate decreases the temperature at which regimes change for a set\nvelocity. Stack also showed that by increasing the flux (ie reducing the time between impacts),\nwhich effectively reduces the oxide thickness, the transition boundaries move to higher\ntemperatures.\nStephenson and Nicholls took the concept of maps one step further by adding wastage rate\ncontours to E-O maps of impact velocity vs particle size for a set temperature. The wastage\nrates were calculated by an E-O Monte Carlo model, which was capable of differentiating\nbetween the different E-O regimes for each impact event.\nThe major draw back with E-O maps is that in order to fully characterise a system one needs a\nwhole family of maps to cover the main variables namely, velocity temperature and particle\nsize and flux. This has recently been done by Stack and Pena [51] who produced a family of\nwear maps of velocity vs particle size for three different compositions and four different\ntemperatures. The maps were produced from a family of graphs of thickness loss vs velocity for\nthree different particle sizes and four different temperatures for four different compositions.\nThese were then used to produce materials performance maps from the low wastage regimes of\nthe E-O maps.\n3.4 Erosion-Oxidation Modelling\nFrom the modelling side there are two main routes that have been followed. The first involves\nan \u2018equation\u2019 approach where the oxidation kinetics of a system are combined with simple mass\n(or volume) loss equations to generate a single complex equation to predict mass loss due to E-\nO, such as those produced by Markworth [49] and Stack [50]. This type of model has a limited\naccuracy and is normally only valid for one of the E-O mechanisms discussed earlier and are\npossibly alloy specific.\nThe model proposed by Markworth et al [49] was based on their observation on the erosion-\noxidation of AISI 446 SS and Stellite 6B and made two major assumptions:\n\uf0b7 That the alloy would always be covered with an oxide layer.\n\uf0b7 That in an erosion event, the erodent would only remove the oxide layer and not the\nsubstrate alloy.\nThese two assumptions meant that the model was effectively limited in accuracy and was only\nvalid under the oxide modified regime discussed earlier. The model was based on parabolic\noxidation kinetics and that the erosion rate was proportional to scale thickness leading to a\nsingle mass loss equation.\nThe model was subsequently expanded [48] by defining an erodent contact footprint, and hence\na volume of oxide removed (all the oxide under the footprint was removed). Footprint size was\nbased on experimental observations and again a single mass loss equation was derived. This\nmodel thus assumes that all impact events are the same and that there is no\ninfluence of particle size variations on the results and it does not take into account the effect of\nimpact angle.\nStack\u2019s [50] model divided E-O into four regimes and was based on the assumption that there\nwas a parabolic oxidation rate between impacts and that the oxidation that occurred during\nimpact was negligible. It was also assumed that the critical scale thickness marked the limiting\nthickness which could be removed above the critical temperature. By defining weight gain per\nunit area as a function of time and temperature and mass loss due to erosion as a function of\ntime per unit area Stack et al were able to construct E-O maps of velocity vs temperature and to\ndetermine how various factors changed the transition zones on the E-O maps as shown in\nfigures 7 and 8.\nAnother, rather more complex, approach, which was taken by Stephenson and Nicholls [63,64],\nwas to use a Monte Carlo statistical approach, where the damage caused by each individual\nimpacting particle is quantified. Although more complex, this enables the model to assess each\nparticle\/oxide (or substrate) interaction and ascertain the E-O regime and determine the amount\nof material removed as a result of the local impact conditions. Recently, a similar approach has\nbeen used to model the erosion of electron beam physical vapour deposited thermal barrier\ncoatings [65,66].\nIn order to model E-O using Monte Carlo methods the following parameters need to be known\nand quantified:\nThese parameters are known to be significant factors in the erosion-oxidation process and\nshould also, ideally, be considered when developing analytical solutions.\nConsider now, the erosion of an oxide covered metallic surface, as discussed above one must\nfirst identify the relevant erosion regime (vis the extensive study of erosion maps) and also\nwithin this regime the material removal mechanism. In simplistic terms, whether oxidation\nmodifies material loss rates due to erosion is a balancing act between \u2018how fast the oxide is\nremoved during erosion\u2019 and \u2018how quickly the oxide can grow\/reform on the erosion damaged\nsurface. If oxide removal rates due to erosion are faster than the growth rate, then the oxide may\ncontribute little to the erosion processes. However, particle impact may have a significant\ninfluence on the rate of oxidation, and may also modify the morphology of the oxide formed\nand also possibly its chemistry.\nAt the other end of the scale, if the oxidation\/corrosion rates are much faster than erosion, then\nthe corrosion processes dominate. In the limit one may find negligible effect of the particle\nimpaction (purely a corrosion\/oxidation process), but the erosion particle flux may transport\ncontaminants that lead to higher oxidation rates. The particles may crack the oxide, giving\nincreased short circuit transport, and therefore high corrosion rates, or if sufficiently energetic\nmay lead to chipping of the oxide by classical brittle fracture mechanisms. This thinning of the\noxide will lead to faster, albeit still protective, oxidation rates.\nAnalytical solutions are possible for both of these limiting cases because the underlying\nmaterial removal mechanisms have been extensively studied \u2013 ductile erosion of the metallic\nsubstrate or brittle erosion of the oxide scale. Critical questions that need answering in some\nquantifiable way are;\nThis may be entirely within the oxide \u2013 the oxide behaves like a bulk ceramic \u2013 but more\nHow does a thin oxide modify the forces transmitted to the substrate and therefore the ductile\nerosion processes?\nWhen impacting a thick oxide, how thick should it be such that the substrate does not see\ndamage from the particle? Also\nWhen will fracture occur within the oxide rather than propagating to the interface and spalling\nthe complete oxide thickness locally? and how local is \u2018locally\u2019?\nIt is this area of substrate\/oxide\/particle interaction that is impossible to solve analytically,\nespecially as it strongly depends on the particles size and kinetic energy and unfortunately not\nall particles are the same size. Under these complexed particle\/surface interaction conditions the\nMonte Carlo method offers a solution.\nThis paper will now concentrate on the Monte Carlo methods required to solve these complexed\ninteraction scenarios that cannot be solved analytically.\nStudies of particle\/oxide\/substrate interactions [35,36] have shown that the degree of surface\ndamage caused by an impact depends on the substrate mechanical properties \u2013 a function of\ntemperature, impact dynamics, - scale composition (scale mechanical properties) and scale\nthickness. Hence, when scales are thin and at sufficiently high temperatures, plastic deformation\nof the scale is able to accommodate the strains induced by particle impaction. Thus no scale\ndamage results, unless scale is removed when the underlying metallic substrate fails in some\nductile way \u2013 cutting, ploughing or extrusion.\nAs the scale thickens, and\/or the temperature is reduced, fracture of the oxide can occur.\nlikely the cracks will propagate through the oxide down to the metal\/oxide interface leading to the\nloss of oxide by a crack running along this interface (spallation). This will leave areas of non-\noxide protected metal and a new scale will grow in the time between impacts, repairing the\ndamage. The new oxide need not be the same as the original oxide; it will depend on the\nchanging substrate composition (due to preferential consumption of some alloying elements),\nthe influence of contaminants transported with the impacting particle and the local gaseous\nenvironment. When particle fluxes are high only thin transient scales may form, before further\nimpaction occurs removing both the substrate alloy and any newly formed oxide upon it by one\nof the prevailing ductile erosion mechanisms.\nWhen the bulk properties of the scale determine the erosion behaviour, scale dominated, using the\nterminology of Stephenson and Nicholls [47], material removal can be considered in terms of the\nlocalised fracture and removal of the scale by \u201cchipping\u201d. Mamoun [67] has modelled this\nregime analytically by assuming that the difference in kinetic energy at impact and during\nrebound is a measure of the energy expended in crack growth. From this knowledge of surface\ncracking he estimates erosion rates.\nIn developing a Monte Carlo model to predict the complex erosion\/oxidation interactions one\nmust identify a parameter which determines whether the oxide is so thin that the system behaves\nin a ductile manner or so thick that it behaves like a bulk ceramic. Oxide thickness [z] would\nprovide such a measure, but does not account for a variable particle size. The best mnemonic is\n(z\/a) [68] the ratio of the oxide thickness (z) to the radius of the particle impact footprint (a).\nThe latter parameter depends on a combination of particle size, density and velocity.\nThus when z\/a is small, less than 0.1 [47], the relative thickness of the oxide is such that the\nerosion behaviour is controlled by the substrate. When z\/a > 0.1 the oxide has a significant\ninfluence on the erosion behaviour. Depending on the severity of impact, the oxide may act to\nprotect the substrate \u2013 if it does not fracture \u2013 or it will spall at the oxide\/substrate interface.\nThe way thin ceramic films can protect metal components has been well studied (for example\nthe analysis of Halling and Arnell[69] and this behaviour accounts for the excellent tribological\nproperties of thin ceramic coatings. Whether the oxide fails or not reflects a complex interplay\nof material properties. Firstly, the stresses as a result of particle impact are the greatest at the\nmetal\/oxide interface for thin oxides, but the oxide\/metal interface is also most crack resistant.\nAs the oxide thickens the stress at that interface drops, but the formation of less protective\noxides, a result of thermal aging, means the interface is more susceptible to crack. Ultimately,\nthe oxide thickens to a stage where the stresses generated at the interface are too low to cause\nfracture there. This occurs at z\/a \u00a7 1. If a layered scale is formed cracking and spalling may\noccur within the scale. Thus erosion proceeds by fracture and removal of discrete volumes of\noxide. A brittle erosion mechanism, similar to that observed for ceramic components ensues.\nThe substrate no longer plays a dominant role and we are in an \u201coxide dominated erosion\u201d\nregion.\nThus using the z\/a parameter, one can characterise the different particle\/substrate interactions\nfor an oxidised surface. In parallel with these mechanical interactions, the oxide must grow.\nThis is assumed to follow parabolic kinetics, i.e.\ndz p1k dz= if the scale is still protective or linear kinetics, i.e. kl= , if non protective:\ndt 2z dt\nThe Mont\u00e9 Carlo simulation, developed at Cranfield [63,64] is a two dimensional model. The\nmodel allows incremental growth of an oxide on the surface elements, assume a log-normal\ndistribution of impacting particles and calculates material removal rates for each cell in the two\ndimensional model. The model parameters are those presented in Table 2.\nOne may ask \u201cHow well does the model work?\u201d This strongly depends on the precision of\nestimates for the material parameters in Table 2. Modern analytical tools (e.g. the nano-\nindenter) allow measurement of particle, oxide and substrate elastic properties and hardness\n(from which the yield stress can be estimated), but properties at elevated temperatures are much\nmore difficult to measure. Reliable estimates of oxide fracture stress are available for some\noxides, e.g. chromia and alumina[24], but not all. How these change as the surface ages and the\noxide grows is unknown. Even with these limitations, this Mont\u00e9 Carlo modelling approach has\npermitted the prediction of erosion\/oxidation rates in this complexed mixed mode\nerosion\/oxidation regime.\nAs shown in Figure 9, one is able to superimpose erosion rate contours onto erosion\/ oxidation\nmaps that take into account the change in erosion\/oxidation regime.\nFigure 10 illustrates predicted metal loss rates for IN73 8LC impacted at 90\u00baC impact angle, in a\nparticle flux of 0.1 kg\/m2\/h at 700\u00baC. At high impact velocities, the erosion rate is dominated by\nthe substrate behaviour. As the impact velocity falls, oxide scales have a chance to form, such\nthat scale removal becomes the controlling mechanism. Under these conditions, the erosion\nrates drop by a factor of 1000, as a protective oxide glaze is formed.\nFigure 11 illustrates a comparison between measured and predicted erosion rates for IN738,\naluminised IN738, AT2B coated IN738, AISI 310, and IN800H using the above Monte Carlo\nmodel to simulate erosion within a gas turbine under simulated coal fired combined cycle\nservice conditions[63]. The test conditions included impact angles from 15-90\u00ba, a variety of\nerodents, a range of gas velocities from 55-250ms-1 and particle loadings between 0.2 and 25\nkg\/m2\/h at 700\u00baC for exposure times up to 300h. The agreement is very good, within a factor of\n3, with predicted erosion rates marginally above those measured, thus providing a conservative\nestimate of component life.\n4. Conclusions\nThis paper has illustrated the complex nature of the erosion-oxidation process and has covered\nthe numerous factors which affect the system showing that erosion-oxidation is not a trivial\nissue. Various different mechanisms have been discussed and how the system variables affects\nthe transitions between the different erosion-oxidation regimes. Erosion-oxidation maps play a\nrole by identifying the regime in which a system will be operating and they can help to\ndetermine the degree of material wastage that can be expected for a given system. Finally the\ndifferent concepts of modelling have been discussed showing the versatility of using Monte\nCarlo statistics in modelling the erosion-corrosion of different systems, giving an accuracy\nwithin a factor of 3.\n1.
