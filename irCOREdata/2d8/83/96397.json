INTRODUCTION \n \nGeographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used in business, government \nand a growing number of academic disciplines. They are clearly \u201cuseful\u201d.  As an \neconomist interested in spatial issues, however, it is not always obvious in what way \nthey might be useful to me (and others similarly interested). This article is an attempt \nto provide a partial answer to that question.   \n \nIt does so in several steps. I start by providing a very brief description of GIS.  I then \ndiscuss how GIS helps deal with spatial data. Dealing with spatial data can be \ncomplicated. I try to highlight some of the problems, but also flag some things that \nGIS experts might worry a lot about, but that do not matter much for applications in \nspatial economics (especially when GIS analysis is used as an input in to further \nstatistical or econometric analysis). Standard GIS textbooks would spend several \nhundred pages carefully discussing these issues; I will cover them in around 2,000 \nwords.  \n \nThe primer covers a number of ways in which GIS can help handle spatial data. A \nfinal section turns to the question of how it can help increase our understanding of \nsocio-economic processes. I argue that, in addition to the role of GIS in facilitating \nresearch with spatial data, it also helps avoid arbitrary discretisation, provides \ninteresting new sources of data and of exogenous variation that allows the \nconstruction of innovative instrumental variables. It is less clear to me how some \n\u201ccutting-edge\u201d advances will help solve the deep problems of spatial economics and \nthe article finishes with brief consideration of those issues. \n \n2. GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS \n \nGIS are used for inputting, storing, managing, analysing and mapping spatial data.3  \nOf course, a wide range of software can provide similar functions for quantitative \ndata. It is the explicit focus on the geographical, or spatial, element that makes GIS \nunique. \n \nTraditionally, spatial data has come from two main sources. Ground survey (what \ngoes on at a particular location) and census (what does the distribution look like \nacross locations). These will be familiar to researchers interested in spatial economics. \nLess familiar, perhaps, are data collected using sensing devices located remotely \n(possibly far from both the object being studied and the data collector).  Examples \ninclude aerial photography and, increasingly, data from satellites (either locational or \nradiometric). The latter are said to provide remote sensing data, although sometimes \nthat term is applied more generally to any data collected indirectly. Remote sensing \ntypically provides large amounts of data on the earth's surface. These data are of \ninherent interest but, as discussed below, may be of particular interest to researchers \nseeking sources of exogenous variation to use as instruments. \n \nThe means of inputting data in to the GIS depends on the source.  One can move from \nanalog maps to digital data by either digitizing (manually tracing over the map) or \n                                                 \n3 I treat any aspect of GIS that takes data in one form and outputs it in another as \u201canalysis\u201d. Some GIS \nexperts would classify a subset of these activities as \u201cmanipulation\u201d.  See, for example, Church and \nMurray (2009). \n[2] \n \nscanning in the map.  Both of these processes require a considerable amount of skill \nand most researchers will want to outsource these tasks (on the basis of either absolute \nor comparative advantage).  I would make a similar comment with respect to \nprocessing remote sensing data from satellites.  \n \nOne proviso, however, is that it can be very important to understand the sources of \nmeasurement error that can occur during the inputting process. Some of these are \nspecific to the way that GIS handles data (e.g. a polygon representing a lake has a \n\u201cgap\u201d in the edges that represent it so the polygon is open, when it should be closed; \nlines on a transport network should intersect at junctions which allow interchange \nbetween routes but incorrect positioning of routes may mean they do not) and some \nare so general as to be not worth considering in detail here (e.g. forgetting to input a \nline of data).  Working on the assumption that your local GIS expert has been careful \nand solved the GIS specific problems for you, the more interesting issues arise \nbecause social scientists sometimes think very differently about measurement error \nand the problems that it creates for subsequent analysis.   \n \nLet me give one example from personal experience. In Burchfield et al (2006) we \nwere interested in characterising urban sprawl and what might cause differences \nacross metropolitan areas. To do this we used remote-sensed land-use data for circa \n8.7 billion 30m by 30m cells covering the US. Remote sensed land-use data may be \neither \u201cleaves-on\u201d or \u201cleaves-off\u201d. If you take a leaves-on land use image of, say, \nMassachusetts then you miss all those urban features sitting under trees.  Ever-green \ntrees give you the same problem all year round. Whether you need to worry about this \ndepends on what you are trying to do with the data. When trying to explain the causes \nof sprawl we used \u201cleaves-off\u201d data focussing on metropolitan areas to minimise \nmeasurement error. In our regressions, we then used region dummies as well as \nlatitude and longitude variables to allow for the fact that the extent of this problem \nmight vary systematically across space. Given that our results were robust to the \ninclusion of these control variables we were reasonably confident that systematic \nmeasurement error (i.e. in some way correlated with our explanatory variables) was \nunlikely to be biasing our results. A surprising number of people could not get past \nthe fact that the remote sensed data measured land use with error even though the \ndummies and controls should mostly mitigate the impact of this error on our results. \nWe also received similar complaints about the fact that the 30m by 30m resolution \ndata we used was not as accurate as, say, land-use parcel data available in particular \ncounties of the US. We thought the trade-off of in terms of slightly less accurate data \nfor the entire US versus more accurate data for one particular county was worth \nmaking to increase our understanding of the factors determining urban sprawl across \nthe US. It is clear that a number of researchers do not agree but, again, what is \nsurprising is that the discussion is often about the existence of measurement error per \nse rather than the impact that this might have on results.  \n \nBefore leaving issues of inputting and measurement error, one final point on the use \nof Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to reduce location measurement error in \nhousehold surveys (particularly in developing countries). It is clear that this could be a \nmajor issue when analysing, say, the determinants and consequences of access to \npublic services. Gibson and McKenzie (2007) discuss use of GPS in household \nsurveys and show that self reported distances can correlate rather badly with actual \ndistance based on GPS measurement. Interestingly, they also suggest that straight line \n[3] \n \ndistances based on point-to-point GPS measurement are very highly correlated with \nmuch more complex calculations based on actual transport networks.  This last point \nechoes the finding of Combes and Lafourcade (2005) that measures of transport costs \nbased on straight line distances perform reasonably well for cross-section data (but \nrather badly for time series changes).  All of this also raises the question of which \nmeasure of distance (actual or perceived) matter for individual behaviours. \n \nThese examples serve to highlight the simple points that (i) as for all data, sources of \nmeasurement error matter for GIS and (ii) social scientists can bring a better \nunderstanding of the consequences of measurement error in GIS data providing we \nunderstand the sources of those errors. I draw similar conclusions from thinking about \nthe way GIS helps store and manage data from a variety of sources.  It is to this issue \nthat I now turn. \n \nBeyond the use of GIS to map data (of which a little more a little later), it appears that \ngrowing numbers of social scientists are using GIS to reconcile spatial data from \ndifferent sources to create new data sets (this tends to be referred to as overlaying).4  \nAt its simplest, this involves using GIS to merge different socio-economic data for the \nsame spatial units. Non-spatial software can handle this easily, so let us turn \nimmediately to the more interesting issue of the use of GIS to merge data recorded for \ndifferent spatial units. For example, household data from census tracts with firm data \nfor post or zip codes. Of course, many social scientists already use concordances to \nmap data from one set of spatial units to another. GIS is particularly useful when such \nconcordances are not readily available or, more interestingly, when such \nconcordances are difficult to construct using standard econometric or data \nmanagement software because the data are recorded using non-nested spatial units.   \n \nTo understand how GIS helps solve these kind of problems we need to briefly \nconsider how data is usually represented in GIS.  That is, what kind of geographical \ndata models GIS uses to store data. There are two common formats: raster and vector. \nRaster format organises spatial data by assigning values to each cell on a regular grid \n(the individual spatial units are usually square, but do not need to be).  In contrast, \nvector format assigns values to irregular polygons and then provides coordinate data \non the location of these polygons. Most GIS software will provide a variety of tools to \nmove between the different representations and to merge \u201clayers\u201d of different data \nrecorded using either format. The methods used are often rather intuitive but, as \nalways, the detail matters.  As with the pre-coded routines that comes with standard \neconometric packages one should have (or be employing someone who has) a \nreasonable grasp of how these transformations occur.   \n \nThe standard references (e.g. Longley et al, 2005; Clarke, 2003; Church and Murray, \n2009) cover the issues concerned in some depth and the reader is referred there for \ndetails. As with inputting data, I will not attempt to provide a systematic discussion of \nthese issues. Some of these are, once again, specific to the way that GIS handles data. \nFor example, because areas in a vector data set may be defined separately, the \ncommon boundaries for two neighbouring areas may not lie on top of one another. If \none is just merging in data that are all recorded for the same spatial units this will not \n                                                 \n4 GIS specialists tend to treat this as an issue of analysis but I think most social scientists would \ndescribe this in their \u201cdata section\u201d as an input to the spatial analysis to follow. \n[4] \n \ncreate a problem.  But if you are merging in data for different spatial units it can do.  \nFor example, London\u2019s electoral wards can be divided in to those in outer London and \nthose in inner London. Imagine defining the boundary between inner and outer \nLondon on the basis of inner London wards. Now ask the GIS to find all wards that \nhave some area inside that boundary. Because common boundaries need not lie \ndirectly on top of one another some outer London wards that are contiguous to inner \nLondon wards may end up with small areas inside the inner London boundary just \ndefined.  If one then tries to overlay inner London data on the ward map of London \nusing the ward-defined inner London boundary these neighbouring outer London \nwards get the inner London value. Of course, it is easy to envisage a non-spatial \nsolution to this kind of aggregation problem because the inner\/outer London \ndistinction is an exact aggregation of London electoral wards.  But GIS is very useful \nin situations where that is not necessarily the case, so it is useful to understand how \nthese misclassification errors arise.  In this example, identifying inner London wards \nas those with \u201cward centroids within the boundary\u201d rather than \u201cany area of the ward \ninside the boundary\u201d would almost certainly fix the problem. \n \nEven raster data that may appear to be reported for an identical grid can suffer from \nthese kind of problems as, for example, small variations in satellite positioning may \nslightly change the gridding of remotely sensed data.  The solution to these kind of \nproblems is complex, but they are sufficiently pervasive that, say, first differencing \n30m by 30m LandSat land cover pixel data from 1990 and 2000 to talk about \nindividual pixel level changes comes with a very significant health warning. \n \nAside from these technical problems, there are interesting conceptual questions about \nwhat rule you should use to assign value data when merging vector data layers that \nare recorded for different (non-nested) spatial units. For example, the European Union \nuses a series of nested spatial units called NUTS to classify sub-national socio-\neconomic data. Moving back and forth between the different levels of this \nclassification is reasonably straightforward. But the boundaries of these units are \nusually political rather than economic, so if researchers create city boundaries based \non commuting patterns these do not line up with the NUTS classification. To move \nbetween cities and NUTS the researcher needs to make some decisions about what to \ndo when a city boundary contains more than one NUTS spatial unit or when a city \nboundary cuts through a NUTS spatial unit.  Obviously, the former problem is usually \neasier to solve (via aggregation) than the latter. Similar considerations will almost \ncertainly apply when trying to merge raster data to vector data (unless there are some \nvery \u201cboxy\u201d looking spatial units in the vector data).  \n \nThe correct answer, of course, depends on the underlying spatial distribution of the \nphenomena for which one has measured attributes. For example, if a phenomena is \nuniformly distributed within spatial units then area weighting can be used to move \nbetween spatial units. In practice, of course, most variables of interest will show \nvariation within spatial units but we may have to use the simplifying assumption of \nuniformity in the absence of any further information on the actual distribution. A good \nexample might be air pollution levels which we may be willing to treat as \napproximately uniformly distributed within spatial units if those units are sufficiently \nsmall. Non-uniform distributions may call for weighting by some other spatial \ncharacteristic (although this characteristic must then be available at smaller spatial \nscales to allow for weighting). For example, we might have data on the number of \n[5] \n \nfirms (but not their employment) for small spatial units which we could use to \nbreakdown total employment recorded for some larger spatial unit by allocating \nemployment to the smaller spatial units in proportion to their share of firms. Huby, \nOwen and Cinderby (2007) provide more examples and further discussion. These \ndecision rules open up interesting areas of overlap between spatial statistical \ntechniques such as kriging and the rules that GIS uses to deal with non-overlapping \nspatial units. There is literature on this, particularly concerning the application of GIS \nto continuous surface data. However, it would be fair to say that the literature is fairly \ntechnical and may not readily accessible to more than a small number of specialists. \nThat said, it is certainly useful to be aware of the problem, particularly because it may \nnot be clear what rule a particular GIS is using when it overlays data.  This also raises \nthe question of the statistical properties of matched survey (rather than census) data.  \nThe effects of such matching have recently been considered for non-spatial data when \nmatching data for the same observational unit from different survey data sources. I am \nnot aware of much discussion of the additional issues this would raise in \ncircumstances where the underlying units of observation are not identical as is the \ncase for non-nested spatial data of the kind discussed here. \n \nThe most powerful aspect of GIS is arguably its ability to quickly analyse spatial data. \nThese tools have been little used in spatial economics outside of a relatively small, \ntechnically proficient group of users. The increasing accessibility of GIS software and \ngrowing interest in spatial issues looks set to change this.  I provide a partial review \nbelow drawing, where possible, on specific examples from the literature. \n \nGIS can be used to identify observations by both characteristics and location and then \nto perform simple statistical operations (e.g. counts). The two most common examples \nin spatial economics are the study of land use and the hedonic analysis of house \nprices.  For example, the 30m by 30m land use raster data we used in Burchfield et al \n(2006) categorizes circa 8.7 billion cells into one of 21 land cover classes. We then \nuse this data to ask questions, say, about the amount of developed land in each state or \nMetropolitan Statistical Area. In hedonic analysis GIS can be used to identify and \ncharacterise properties of the residence and the parcel on which it sits as well as wider \nneighbourhood characteristics derived by merging the point data locating houses to \nother socio-economic data (see Bateman, Jones, Lovett, Lake and Day (2002) for a \nreview).  \n \nLocating and characterising observations is the most basic form of analysis in GIS. \nHowever, much more complex analysis is possible. Given that GIS data are spatial, a \nnatural use of GIS is for measurement. For example, GIS can be used to measure the \nlength of lines, the perimeter or area of polygons and the distance between \nobservations or between observations and other features of interest.  These distances \ncould be physical distances, network distances (e.g. along a transport network) or \ninvolve some more general concept of social distance.  GIS can also use information \non absolute barriers (e.g. impassable rivers) to calculate shortest path-distance.  \nAdditional information on movement costs, be they continuous (e.g. gradient) or \ndiscrete (a border crossing), can be incorporated to calculate least cost surfaces or \npaths (along a network).  GIS can also be used to measure shape (e.g. to capture \nsinuosity by taking the ratio of straight line to actual distance).   \n \n[6] \n \nI am not familiar with applications of sinuosity outside of environmental\/ecological \nresearch, but there may be some. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) have used measures \nof polygon shape to characterise back gardens and their impact on housing values in a \nhedonic analysis.  Least cost path analysis has been widely used in the transport \neconomics literature to calculate transport costs between locations. These methods are \nnow being applied in other fields. For example, Donaldson (2009) uses least cost path \nanalysis to calculate transport costs in his fascinating paper studying the economic \nimpact of India\u2019s vast rail network.  Faber (2009) goes one step further and uses data \non impedance values of gradients etc to calculate least cost routes between major \nChinese cities and then employs a spanning tree algorithm to construct the least cost \nnetwork. He then uses this network as an instrument for the actual Chinese highway \nnetwork in a study of the economic impact of roads.5 The problem that this addresses \nis a well understood one \u2013 how do we identify the causal impact of roads on local \neconomies when local economic outcomes help determine road placement?  For \nplaces that lie in between the major Chinese cities (the nodes on the network) being \nclose to the path followed by the least cost network should increase the probability of \nbeing on the actual network but should not affect economic outcomes otherwise.  It \nthus provides a valid instrument.  Similar, in spirit, are the identification strategies \nused by, for example, Baum-Snow (2007), Michaels (2008), Duranton and Turner \n(2009) and Donaldson (2009) all of whom rely on historical plans (e.g. for the \ninterstate highway system) or historical networks as instruments for the actual \nnetwork. These papers all use GIS to construct their instrument but Faber (2009) is \nthe first paper that I know of to use the alternative strategy of building his instrument \nusing GIS analysis to provide the lowest cost network.  Of course, such techniques \nhave been extensively used in transport economics and planning, what is interesting \nhere is the use of these techniques to construct instruments to help identify the causal \neffect of roads on spatial economic outcomes. I discuss this further below. \n \nGIS experts will sometimes distinguish between the use of GIS to measure distance of \nobservations from other features and its use to calculate the distance between \nobservations.  While the former could be regarded as a specific example of the use of \nGIS for measurement, the latter provide one specific example of the use of GIS to \nunderstand spatial arrangement. Hedonic analysis provides plenty of examples of the \nuse of GIS to measure distance from observations to other features.  To take just one \nexample, Gibbons and Machin (2005) use GIS to measure the proximity of properties \nto rivers, coasts, woodlands, roads, railway lines and airports in their study valuing \nrail access. Turning to the broader issue of spatial arrangement there are a number of \npotential areas of overlap between GIS and spatial economics which have only just \nbegun to be explored.  I consider these issues next. \n \n                                                 \n5 The problem with identifying the causal impact of new roads on economic outcomes is that the \nplacement of roads is not random.  When we see that building new roads is, say, positively correlated \nwith higher employment we cannot be sure whether the new road caused higher employment or \nwhether the road was built to connect places where employment growth was already high. In the \nabsence of random placement, instrumental variables provide one possible solution to this problem. \nInstruments need to be correlated with the dependent variable of interest but otherwise independent of \nthe outcome. In the roads example, this means something that is correlated with the likelihood of a new \nroad being built but otherwise independent of area employment. Faber argues that his lowest cost \nnetwork satisfies these two conditions because planners care about costs when placing roads but that \nthe lowest cost route should not affect (or be affected by) employment otherwise. \n[7] \n \nResearchers in biology and biomedical sciences already make extensive use of \nobservation to observation distance in their statistical modelling of spatial point \npatterns (see Diggle, 2003). If distance affects the strength of the interaction between \nobservations (e.g. the chance that I catch a disease from you) then knowing the \nrelative position of observations can help understand outcomes (e.g. incidence of a \ndisease).  Examples abound in spatial economics.  For example, in models of spatial \ncompetition the intensity of competition faced by firms may depend on the distance \nbetween them and rival firms.  In models of matching, the chance of, and payoff from, \na match can depend on the average distance between individuals.  Observation to \nobservation distances are also useful when we want to assess whether there are \nsystematic patterns in individual location choices.  For example, studies of \nlocalisation assess whether firms in a specific industry tend to be spatially \nconcentrated (or dispersed) relative to overall economic activity.  If they are, then \nobservation to observation distances for firms in this industry will be less than for \nfirms randomly chosen from the economy at large (and vice-versa if the industry is \ndispersed).  More generally, the distribution of observation to observation distances \n(or statistics based on that distribution) should allow us to assess both the existence \nand extent of any systematic departures from random location. The increased \navailability of geo-referenced economic data should see these distance based \ntechniques become more common in spatial economics.  \n \nIn the context of this article I should note, however, that it is not completely clear to \nme whether this should always involve the use of GIS to construct these distances. \nSimple one-off calculations of distance from observation to features (e.g. for use in a \nsubsequent hedonic regression) are fairly easy to implement in GIS. There is also a \nconsiderable time saving to be had as soon as the calculations become more \ncomplicated. GIS software is, for example, quick at finding nearest neighbours.  Its \ncomparative advantage becomes greater as the number of observations increases. This \nis because the brute-force approach of, for example, taking the distance between all \nobservations and identifying the minimum involves a rapidly increasing number of \ncalculations as the number of observations grows. In contrast, because GIS uses \nalgorithms that reduce the rate of increase in the number of calculations, it becomes \nincreasingly efficient as the number of observations grows.  Of course, one could \nincorporate these algorithms in to non-GIS routines but the sunk costs of doing so \nmay well exceed those of familiarising oneself with an off the shelf GIS.  \n \nPersonal experience suggests that this may not be the case for point to point analysis \nwhen bootstrapping is nearly always needed to calculate statistical significance. For \nexample, in Duranton and Overman (2005) we used the distribution of distance \nbetween firms to assess the location patterns of around 250 UK industries with, on \naverage, 700 plants per industry. We started by using non-parametric kernel density \nestimation to calculate the actual distribution of bilateral distances.  To bootstrap the \nglobal and local confidence intervals for each industry we drew 1000 random samples \nfrom the population of all UK manufacturing plants. For each of these random \nsamples we again used non-parametric kernel density techniques to estimate the \ndistribution of bilateral distances and used the resulting distributions to calculate \nconfidence intervals and bands. We did all of this in gauss using a non-parametric \nkernel routine taken from an existing library with a simple C+ routine providing a \nfirst pass binning of the data for speed. In principle, one could write batch files (i.e. \nwhere the user writes a sequence of commands in a file that the computer implements \n[8] \n \none by one) to achieve something similar in GIS. This involves fairly large fixed costs \nin terms of both purchasing software and learning how to implement the relevant \nprocedures. Personally, I would not know how to automate such a procedure in GIS \nand it may well be that many spatial economists would similarly find the non-GIS \nroute a more efficient way of dealing with the problem given their background.  I am \nincreasingly convinced, however, that the sunk costs are worth incurring in many \nsimpler situations where GIS calculations should be either more accurate or \nconsiderably faster than short cuts implemented using non-spatial software. \n \nA good example of this is the use of GIS to define neighbourhoods (or \u201cbuffers\u201d) \naround objects. For example in Burchfield et al (2006) we use GIS to calculate the \npercentage of the urban fringe - defined as a 20 kilometer buffer around existing \ndevelopment - that lies above water yielding aquifers. The use of such buffers is in its \ninfancy in socio-economic applications but has the potential to be very useful because \nit reduces the need for research to rely on arbitrary discretisations of the study area of \ninterest.  For example, in Duranton et al (2009) we study the impact of local taxation \non firms.  To do this, we build on research by Holmes (1998) who examines the \nimpact of labour laws on employment by looking at employment in counties either \nside of state boundaries where the states have different labour laws.  The idea is that \nthis should control for unobservable factors that might affect both overall county \nemployment and the type of labour laws in place. The identifying assumption is that \nfirms in these neighbouring counties only differ in terms of labour laws (because they \nare in different states) but otherwise face similar environments.  In our work, because \nwe have geo-referenced data, we do not have to rely on arbitrary county boundaries to \ncontrol for unobservables.  Instead we simply identify all firms that are located within \na given distance of the jurisdictional boundaries that separate the authorities who set \nthe local tax. Whether this is useful will depend on the degree to which boundaries are \narbitrary with respect to the phenomena under study and the extent to which there is \nsignificant variation in unobserved conditions within spatial units defined by the set of \nboundaries. It certainly provides a useful step forward when boundaries are arbitrary \nand the degree of unobserved variation within spatial units is large. \n \nSo far, I have covered the use of GIS for inputting, storing, managing and analysing \nspatial data. I have saved the most frequent application in spatial economics to last \u2013 \nthe use of GIS to visualise or map economic data with a spatial component. I do not \nhave much to say on this. Most entry level courses in econometrics begin with a plea \nto \u201cplot the data\u201d at an early stage of analysis to help identify trends, outliers etc. \nMuch the same could be said of the role of mapping spatial data and GIS provides a \nsimple and efficient way to do this.  Mapping raises a number of issues to do with the \nappropriate representation of spatial data.  Some of these have clear non-spatial \nanalogues. For example, when drawing a choropleth map (where areas are shaded in \nproportion to some outcome of interest) one needs to divide up the data and associate \na given shade or colour with a specific range of outcomes. This \u201cbinning\u201d of data for \na choropleth map involves similar issues as does the binning of a data for a histogram. \nFor example, should one define bins to cover equal ranges of the outcome variable \n(e.g. 0-999, 1000-1999 etc) or to contain equal proportions of the overall observations \n(e.g. each bin contains 10% of the overall observations).  Some are more specific, for \nexample, how to overlay a number of features occurring at the same location? \nStandard GIS textbooks provide further discussion. \n \n[9] \n \n3. CAN GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS HELP INCREASE \nOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPATIAL ECONOMY? \n \nSo far I have talked a lot about GIS in a rather instrumental way (i.e. what it can do).  \nFor the final part of this article I want to focus on the extent to which it can help us \nincrease our understanding of socio-economic phenomena.  In part this provides a \nsummary of the discussion above, but I also want to use it to consider the way in \nwhich GIS helps introduce us to new data and to new sources of exogenous variation.  \n \nI have already considered the ways in which GIS can reduce measurement error, \nparticularly with respect to the more precise location of observations. This issue has \nreceived little attention in the literature, perhaps because there was relatively little, \nhitherto, that researchers could do about it.  As discussed above, the increasing use of \nGIS and the availability of geo-referenced data look set to change this. \n \nThe somewhat related issue of the arbitrary discretisation of continuous space has \nreceived considerably more attention. This is particularly the case in studies which \nfocus on the level or growth rate of economic outcomes for spatial units (be they \nneighbourhoods, cities or regions). Two common solutions have been adopted.  Either \nresearchers have sought to identify \u201cfunctional areas\u201d using a variety of criteria (e.g. \ncommuting flows to give travel to work areas) or else they have presented results at a \nvariety of spatial scales.  Similar problems and solutions have been discussed in the \nliterature concerned with the spatial patterns of location of particular activities and \nother areas of interest. Once again, hitherto, there was little more that researchers \ncould do about this problem. The increasing use of GIS to allow reconciliation of data \nfor different, possibly non-nested, spatial units will help address this problem too. It \nshould also help us to identify whether these issues are or first order importance in \nany given context.  For example, Briant, Combes and Lafourcade (2008) show that \nresults from a number of common empirical exercises depend on the size of spatial \nunits but are not much affected by the shape of those units.6 Interestingly both \ndimensions are of second order importance compared to specification issues, a \nquestion to which we return below in considering the role of GIS in addressing the \ndeep problems of spatial economics.  \n \nIn some circumstances geo-referenced data should allow researchers to circumvent \nthe problem of the discretisation of continuous space altogether, by switching to \ncontinuous space. See Duranton and Overman (2005) for a specific example and \nfurther discussion. My feeling, however, is that the solution of switching to \ncontinuous space is more readily applicable in some situations than in others.  For \nexample, if we are concerned with structuring our analysis using general equilibrium \nconstraints then it can be difficult to impose these in continuous space. As Desmet \nand Rossi-Hansberg (2009, p xx.) discuss further in this issue \u201cin the presence of [\u2026] \ntransport or commuting costs, clearing factor and goods markets is not trivial. [H]ow \nmany goods or factors are lost in transit depends on mobility and trade patterns, which \nin turn depend on factor prices that are the result of market clearing. [\u2026] That is, \nfactor prices at each location depend on the equilibrium pattern of trade and mobility \nat all locations.\u201d  As Desmet and Rossi Hansberg (2009) make clear, there have been \n                                                 \n6 The fact that the size or shape of an area may effect empirical results is commonly known as the \nModifiable Areal Unit Problem (or MAUP) following detailed consideration in Openshaw (1984). \n[10] \n \ntheoretical advances along these lines so empirical implementation is not \ninconceivable, but I don\u2019t think we are there yet.  I will consider the role of theory a \nlittle more below. \n \nAs researchers become more familiar with using GIS to integrate data from different \nsources, they will be increasingly exposed to new sources and types of data that can \nhelp increase our understanding of spatial economic phenomena. I have already \ndiscussed the fact that remote sensing data from either satellite or aerial photography \ncan provide a vast amount of data on the earth\u2019s surface. Digitised geological maps \nprovide a further source of information. These data have already seen extensive use in \nnatural and environmental resource management, as well as in agricultural economics. \nOutside of these fields, data on land cover and land use (i.e., the physical features that \ncover the land and what those features are used for), soil type, geological and \nlandscape features, elevation and climate are increasingly being used to construct \nexplanatory variables to help increase our understanding of different features of the \neconomic landscape. Consider a few examples. At least since Rosen (1974) urban \neconomists have been interested in the impact of climate on city population. In \ncontrast to earlier studies, however, Rappaport\u2019s (2007) research is able to use \nmeteorological data that comes from 6,000 meteorological stations and covers 20 \nwinter, summer and precipitation variables. GIS analysis by the Spatial Climate \nAnalysis Surface at Oregon State University applied to this meteorological data \nallows the construction of weather variables for a 2 kilometre grid covering the \ncontinental U.S.  Deschenes and Greenstone (2007) combine soil quality data for \n800,000 sites combined with 4km by 4km grided precipitation and temperature data to \nprovide an estimate of the impact of climate change on agricultural output.  In a very \ndifferent context, Nunn and Puga (2009) calculate the ruggedness of different \ncountries using a global elevation data set whose underlying spatial units are 1km by \n1km squares.  They then use this data to study the impact of ruggedness in Africa with \nthe startling finding that the indirect effect (rugged terrain protected against slave \ntraders) outweighs the direct effect (ruggedness hinders trade and productivity). It is \nhard to see how any of these exercises would have been feasible without the \navailability of GIS. \n \nNew data, particularly on features of the earth\u2019s surface are also great sources of \nexogenous variation. As a result, researchers are increasingly using GIS data to \nconstruct innovative instruments to help identify causal effects in a range of different \nliteratures. Some examples should help to make this idea concrete.  \n \nHoxby (2000) is interested in whether competition among public schools improves \noutcomes. In systems, such as the US, where school districts have strong control over \nschools (rather than individual schools making their own choices) competition \namongst public schools should get stronger as the number of school districts \nincreases. That is, cities with more school districts should have better public schools \nand less private schooling. The problem in examining this hypothesis is that, \nconditional on city size, better public schools and less private schools should imply \nmore school districts (assuming school districts are roughly equally sized across \ncities). Because the number of districts is endogenous to public school quality we \nneed an instrument that determines the supply of school districts but that is \nindependent of the local public school quality.  Hoxby argues that the number of \nstreams in a metropolitan area provides such an instrument because cities with a large \n[11] \n \nnumber of streams end up with more school districts for reasons unrelated to school \nquality. This paper provides a well known example of the strategy, although not of the \nuse of GIS as her work is based on the study of detailed paper maps. As an aside, it is \ninteresting to note that part of the ensuing controversy over the robustness of Hoxby\u2019s \nresults (see Rothstein, 2007 and Hoxby, 2007) concerns the construction of the \nstreams variable that is used as an instrument.   \n \nOn the subject of streams, Duflo and Pande (2007) use GIS to help study the \nproductivity and distributional impact of large irrigation dams in India. The problem \nwith studying this impact is that the citing of dams is not random so that regions with \nand without dams are likely to differ along other dimensions (e.g. agricultural \nproductivity).  However, it turns out the gradient at which a river flows affects the \nease of dam construction.  Irrigation dams work best with low (but nonzero) river \ngradient.  Hydro electric dams work best with steep river gradient. They use \ntopographic data from the same source as Nunn and Puga (2009) to characterise \nelevation and gradient and to construct instruments that are positively correlated with \nthe likelihood of getting an irrigation dam but otherwise independent of agricultural \nproductivity. \n \nFor our final couple of examples, consider the use of GIS to construct instruments that \ncan be used to help identify the causal impact of density on productivity. Again, the \nproblem itself has long been recognised.  High density may cause high productivity, \nbut high productivity for some other reason will in turn attract firms leading to high \ndensity (rather than vice-versa). Once again, what we need is something correlated \nwith density but independent of productivity. Rosenthal and Strange (2008) provide a \nneat example by noting that the density of employment will be partly determined by \nthe height of buildings in a location. Building height, in turn, is partly dependent on \nthe underlying geology of the site. Given that, outside of agriculture, geology should \nnot determine wages directly, the underlying geology can be used as an instrument.  \nThey use GIS data on the type of underlying bedrock, seismic and landslip hazard as \ninstruments for the density of employment in their regressions of wages on \nemployment density. Combes et al (2009) use a similar idea and data from the \nEuropean Soil Database for 1 km by 1 km cells to construct a number of instruments \ndescribing the mineralogy of the sub and top-soils, the nature of the dominant parent \nmaterial at broad and detailed level, seven other characteristics of the soil such as \nwater capacity as well as the ruggedness of the terrain.  \n \nThese examples are clearly not extensive.  However, they do serve to give some \nflavour of the emerging research and I think all of this suggests a potentially \nimportant role in future work for GIS data as a component in novel instrumentation \nstrategies.7 I think there will also be a place for GIS to play an increasing role in the \ntreatment effects literature.  Linden and Rockoff (2008) provide a nice example where \nthey exploit both the timing of move-in and the exact location of sex offenders to \nimprove on existing estimates of the impact of crime risks on property values. \n \nTo many GIS specialists, this might all sound rather bread and butter. Where are all \nthe cutting-edge advances? Here, I think my own disciplinary background as an \n                                                 \n7 It should be noted that the increasing availability of instruments is not without costs. In terms of bias, \nsimple OLS results may be preferred to IV results using large numbers of weak instruments.  See \nAngrist and Pishcke (2009) for further discussion. \n[12] \n \neconomist strongly colours my thinking. For me, the deep issues in empirical spatial \neconomics are unlikely to be addressed by these advances.  For example, what role \nshould theory play in structuring our empirical analysis? Tiebout models of residential \nsegregation are useful in structuring the analysis of residential sorting across \nneighbourhoods (e.g. as demonstrated by Epple and coauthors in this issue). What \nrole could theory then play in furthering the empirical study of the production \nstructure of regions (e.g. as in Hanson (2005), Combes and Lafource (2001), Mion \n(2004))?  Or is the latter situation too complex to be amenable to full structural \nmodelling and thus better suited to the kind of mixed estimation\/calibration exercises \nthat appear to be increasingly popular in, say, the international trade literature (e.g. \nEaton and Kramatz (2004))? What role should theory play in achieving identification \nof causal effects? Instead of theory, should the emphasis be on the treatment effects \nliterature that is increasingly popular in the labour literature? Or on instrumental \nvariables? Or on setting up experiments involving researcher generated exogenous \nvariation as seems to be increasingly popular in the development literature? I refer the \ninterested reader to Holmes (this issue), for more discussion. \n \nA quick look at the cutting edge of GIS analysis and modelling suggests that it is \ngrappling with a very different set of issues. It so happens that as I was writing this \npiece I received an invitation to the Third International Cartographic Association \nWorkshop on Geospatial Analysis and Modelling. Here is a quick run down of the list \nof highlighted topics: Cellular automata and agent based modelling; Visual analytical \ntools for environmental and urban systems; Analysis of human movement data; \nSpatio-temporal data mining; Hierarchies, scaling and fractal structure of geographic \npatterns; Modeling vehicle dynamics and crowd behaviour; Patterns of human spatial \nbehavior and migration; Urban high-resolution morphology; Small world modeling \nand spatial interactions.  If one was to attend, one would expect to see lots of very \ncool graphics, some very neat simulations and some serious spatial statistical \nmodelling. This would have strong synergies with some areas of regional science that \nhave increasingly relied on models from physics and biology to structure their \nanalysis. Most spatial economists find it difficult to engage with that agenda (see, for \nexample, Overman 2009) and our priorities, as outlined above, lie elsewhere. \nEconomists are uncomfortable with predictions, but for what it is worth, I see myself \nsticking to the GIS bread and butter diet for some time to come.  \n \n \n[13] \n \nReferences \n \nAngrist, Joshua and J\u00f6rn-Steffen Pischke. 2009.
