Vasoconstrictors activate cell surface receptors to initiate signaling cascades involving increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and recruitment of protein kinase C (PKC), leading to ASM contraction, though the PKC isoenzymes involved vary between different vasoconstrictors and their actions. Here, we have used confocal microscopy of enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP)-labeled PKC isoenzymes to visualize PKC translocation in primary rat mesenteric ASM cells in response to physiological vasoconstrictors, with simultaneous imaging of Ca2+ signaling. Endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and uridine triphosphate all caused translocation of each of the PKC isoenzymes , , and ; however, the kinetics of translocation varied between agonists and PKC isoenzymes. Translocation of eGFP-PKC mirrored the rise in [Ca2+]i, while that of eGFP-PKC or - occurred more slowly. Endothelin-induced translocation of eGFP-PKC was often sustained for several minutes, while responses to angiotensin II were always transient. In addition, preventing [Ca2+]i increases using 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra-(acetoxymethyl) ester prevented eGFP-PKC translocation, while eGFP-PKC translocated more rapidly.
