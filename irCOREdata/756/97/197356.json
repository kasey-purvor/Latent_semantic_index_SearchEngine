Forensic dictionary analysis \nuses evidence-based methodologies to interrogate the dictionaries themselves about \ndecision-making processes involved in their compilation. The version of events that \nthis reveals is sometimes quite different from compilers\u201f accounts. This paper builds \non a variety of approaches in historical dictionary research - statistical, textual, \ncontextual, and qualitative - to present forensic dictionary analysis as a technique that \nallows researchers to examine and understand the complex relationships between \neditorial policy and lexicographic practice.  \n \n1. Introduction \n \nIn this paper we seek to outline a methodology, which we call forensic dictionary \nanalysis, by which the dictionary researcher can examine, understand, and reconstruct \nlexicographic policies and practices - policies and practices that sometimes differ \nfrom the accounts given by the lexicographers themselves. Forensic dictionary \nanalysis provides the dictionary researcher with a methodology to combine statistical, \ntextual, contextual, and qualitative analyses, to achieve a more complete picture of the \nmaking of the dictionary.  \n Much research on historical dictionaries to date has focussed on quotational \nevidence. Studies using the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), and a few using the \nMiddle English Dictionary (MED; Kurath et al. 1952\u20132001), have examined the \nnumber and style of quotations, types of source, rate of citation of individual authors \nand works, and typographical representation (e.g. McConchie 1997, Brewer 2006, \n 2 \n2007a, Carter Hailey 2007). Other studies have used the quotations in OED or MED \nas a discrete corpus from which to comment on lexical and grammatical changes in \nEnglish over time (e.g. Dekeyser 1986, Jucker 1994, Coleman 1995, Fischer 1997, \nNevalainen 1999, Bauer 2001, Mair 2001, Markus 2001, Hoffman 2004, to cite only a \nsmall selection). These studies have not always addressed the problems involved in \nusing dictionary material as objective evidence of usage, as identified by Sch\u00e4fer \n(1980) in his masterly study of Nashe and Shakespeare in the OED. \nPurely qualitative dictionary studies are rare: dictionaries lend themselves to \nquantitative analysis. For instance, although their accounts are largely descriptive, \nStarnes and Noyes (1946) and Landau (1984: 35\u201372) both include estimates of \nnumbers of words defined and proportions of entries derived from earlier dictionaries. \nDespite the long-established use of numerical description in dictionary studies, Lynch \nand McDermott (2005: 4) found that a dictionary as well-researched as Johnson\u201fs \u201ehas \nled a kind of double life\u201f, in which selective treatment of its contents has sustained the \nbelief that the dictionary is simultaneously prescriptive and quirky.  \n \n2. Forensic Dictionary Analysis \n \nLike the judge in a criminal court, the dictionary researcher is faced with evidence of \nvarious types and varying reliability. Prefatory and publicity material is equivalent to \nwitness statements: first-hand evidence is always valuable, but it is inevitably \nsubjective and there may be motivations for distorting the truth. Archival material, \nwhere it exists and is accessible, allows the dictionary researcher to cross-examine \npublished statements, but it will probably be both partial and incomplete. Few \ndictionaries are consistent in the application of lexicographic policies, but this need \nnot be presented as a flaw: good lexicographers learn from experience, remain \nflexible in their practice, and adapt their policies to the needs of each entry.\n2\n \nCircumstantial evidence may also be useful \u2013 every dictionary is a product of its \nmaterial, cultural and social circumstances, and it can only be properly understood as \na result of its historical context and textual tradition \u2013 but interpretations based on \ncircumstantial evidence are inevitably subjective and partial. The most reliable \nevidence is contained within the body of the dictionary itself. Statistical analysis of a \ndictionary\u201fs contents is equivalent to the work of the crime scene investigator: \nlexicographers leave traces of themselves in the dictionaries they produce, and \n 3 \ndictionary researchers can thus reconstruct their working practice for comparison with \npublic or private statements of principle. Forensic dictionary analysis brings together \nthese different types of evidence to explore the complex relationships between \nprinciples and practice in dictionary production. \nThis paper explores various methodologies used by dictionary researchers, \nconcentrating particularly on statistical methodologies, and identifies examples of \ngood and bad practice. Numerical results can be unduly convincing: statistical \nanalysis is only useful if it is rigorous, and the rigour and success of quantitative \nanalysis is dependent on a well thought-out strategy with regard to the parameters of \nthe study and the sampling techniques adopted. This paper outlines the decisions \ndictionary researchers must make and the considerations they must take into account \nbefore they embark on a statistical analysis of a dictionary\u201fs contents. Although \nstatistical analysis can identify inconsistencies, it cannot explain them: weighing up \nthe various types of evidence available is what enables the forensic dictionary \nresearcher to pronounce a reliable verdict.  \n \n2.1 Determining the parameters.  \n \nThe first step in analysing a dictionary statistically is to reduce its contents to \ncountable features and to determine the parameters of the case study. Countable \nfeatures with regard to the words listed include headword, pronunciation, \northography, variant forms, etymology, region, register, semantic field, word class, \nand age (see Table 1 for further explanation). The lexicographic treatment of these \nwords can be analysed with reference to, for example, labelling, style, and the \nprovision of semantically related terms, compounds, and phrases.  \n Parameters of analysis are dependent on the focus of the case study. To take a \nfamiliar example, an analysis of the OED that looked at the proportion of neologisms \ncreated by Shakespeare as opposed to those created by Milton would limit its focus \nsolely to quotational evidence, in particular to the three parameters of author, date, \nand number of quotations.\n3\n A case study focussing on a wider issue, such as the \ntreatment of loanwords in the OED, would require parameters of analysis that were \nwider than quotational evidence alone. As summarized in Table 1, lexicographic \ntreatment (such as labelling), as well as general presentation and treatment of features \nof each headword (such as pronunciation, variant forms, or etymology) are all \n 4 \nrelevant to the analysis. A comparison of these countable features would allow the \nresearcher to comment not only on proportions of loanwords with respect to the whole \nlexicon, but also on more sophisticated issues of borrowing in English, such as \nwhether there was a bias towards loans from a particular region, language, or \nsemantic field in a particular century, or whether such patterns in the dictionary were \nmerely a consequence of inconsistent lexicographic practice. \n \nINSERT Table 1 here \n \n2.2 Selecting a sample.  \n \nOnce the parameters of analysis are determined, the researcher needs to decide on a \ncase study sample. Sampling an entire dictionary is rarely an option unless electronic \nsearching provides a reliable reflection of the dictionary\u201fs total contents. Some early \nor specialized dictionaries contain only a few thousand entries and are thus amenable \nto mechanical analysis in their entirety, but in most cases the researcher will have to \nchoose a sample for analysis. Any sample must ensure good coverage of the alphabet \nand (for multi-editor works) a balanced representation of lexicographic work by all \neditors over all time periods. In choosing a sample, the researcher needs to be aware \nof possible \u201ealphabet fatigue\u201f, a phenomenon by which lexicographers work with \ngreater thoroughness at the beginning of the alphabet than the end (Starnes and Noyes \n1946: 185, Osselton 2007). Conversely, some lexicographers treat individual entries \nwith more thoroughness towards the end of the alphabet (de Schryver 2005). In \nJohnson studies, dictionary researchers often sample the letter \u201eL\u201f, presumably on the \nassumption that the middle of the alphabet is more representative than either end \n(Miyoshi 2007: 31). Whether a study is intended to explore changing methodology or \nto generalize about the dictionary\u201fs contents, it is clearly necessary to sample from the \nwhole alphabetical range. Gotti (1999: 61\u201367), for instance, sampled the letter A in B. \nE.\u201fs New Dictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew (c.1698), \nand used that as the basis for his description of the dictionary\u201fs contents. Using a \nmore representative sample, Coleman (2004a: 76\u2013126) identified several statistically \nsignificant differences between the dictionary\u201fs treatment of the first and second half \nof the alphabet, including the rate of provision of etymologies, proverbial sayings, \n 5 \nusage labels, and cross-references.\n4\n In this case, the dictionary\u201fs compiler was clearly \nlearning from experience. \nAllowing for changing methodology by sampling each letter of the alphabet is \nonly the first step in identifying an appropriate sample. Depending on the focus of a \nstudy, selecting the sample range of two comparative dictionaries would be \nproblematic unless the same sections of the alphabet were compared. Terms \nbeginning <al->, for example, are disproportionately of Arabic origin (reflecting the \ndefinite article prefix Arabic al-) and if the sample from one dictionary is selected \nfrom this range, while the sample for the comparator dictionary comes from \nelsewhere in the letter A, an apparently significant preference for terms from Arabic \nwill be a result of the sampling technique rather than of differences in dictionary \ncontent. To avoid introducing such biases, or in order to account for the significance \nof such patterns, the researcher might select the sample from one dictionary randomly \nand then match that sample from the comparator text. \nAn example of sampling bias is provided by Jespersen\u201fs ground-breaking \nanalysis of French loanwords (1905). Using sections of the first edition of the OED \n(OED1; Murray et al. 1888\u20131928) that had been published by that date, he took the \nfirst hundred French words under A\u2013G and the first fifty under I and J. However, the \nresults were skewed by the decision to exclude words listed with fewer than five \nquotations. This applied to many nineteenth-century loans because OED editors rarely \ngave more than four quotations per century, and thus Jespersen\u201fs results provided a \nmisleading overview both of the coverage of French loans in the OED and of the \ncontinued influence of French upon English. \nFor multi-editor dictionaries, it may be more appropriate to sample the work \nof each editor rather than each letter of the alphabet. For example, in OED1 two \nportions of the letter S were edited by Henry Bradley (S\u2013SH and ST\u2013STY), one by \nWilliam Craigie (SI\u2013SQU), and one by Charles Onions (SU\u2013SZM). With dictionary \nprojects that were published gradually, it is also possible to select early and later \nexamples of each editor\u201fs work, so their development as lexicographers can be traced.  \nMethodological trends are not always unidirectional, and changes in a \nlexicographer\u201fs practice over time do not necessarily reflect changes in their \nindividual style. For example, the final volume of Farmer and Henley\u201fs Slang and its \nAnalogues (1890\u20131904), which was published after Henley\u201fs death, reverts in several \nrespects to the policies of the first edition, compiled by Farmer alone. This suggests \n 6 \nthat Farmer had continued to work in the same way, but that his drafts had been edited \nand improved by Henley (Coleman 2007). \nIn order to explore the reliability of different sampling methods, various \nsamples were extracted from Hotten\u201fs (1859) A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, \nand Vulgar Words. The dictionary was also analysed in its entirety, as shown in Table \n2.  \n \nINSERT Table 2 here \n \nThe main list in this dictionary contains 2204 sense divisions for 2030 headwords in \ntotal,\n5\n and each pair of columns shows the number and proportion of entries \ncontaining attributed citations, authorities named but not quoted, and unattributed \nexamples of use. \u03c72 tests show no statistically significant differences between these \nsamples. In other words, for this dictionary all of these sampling techniques support \nconclusions that are in line with results for the whole dictionary. \nHowever, there appear to be differences between the beginning and end of the \ndictionary. Comparison between the various samples in Table 2 suggests that Hotten \nincluded more citations and fewer unattributed examples of use at the beginning of \nthe dictionary than the end, but the first two sampling techniques do not allow us to \nexplore this. Table 3 shows how alphabetically distributed samples can be used to \ninterrogate changes in lexicographic practice through time. \n \nINSERT Table 3 here \n \nWhen results for the entire dictionary are subjected to the \u03c72 test, the apparent \ndifferences between the provision of unattributed examples of use in the first and \nsecond halves of the alphabet prove to be highly significant, though the decrease in \ncitations is not. The two sampling techniques both reflect this highly significant \nincrease in unattributed examples, demonstrating that both approaches offer a sound \nbasis for analyzing changes in methodology in this dictionary.  \nAlthough comparing two data points has clarity to recommend it, this is likely \nto be at the expense of detail. Having identified that there is a difference between the \nfirst and second half of the alphabets, the focus can be adjusted to identify when the \nincrease in unattributed examples took place. Figures 1\u20133, based on the raw figures \n 7 \npresented in Tables 4\u20136, all confirm the increasing trend in the provision of \nunattributed examples of use, but only Figure 3 can demonstrate that this reaches a \npeak in the letter \u201eV\u201f and falls off towards the end of the alphabet. These results also \ndemonstrate the importance of matching sample size to purpose: as the samples are \nchopped into ever smaller pieces their reliability decreases. In a bigger dictionary \n10% of entries under each letter would be a more reliable sample than the first 50 \nentries, but for a small dictionary a 10% sample gives unreliable results. \nPresentation of results by percentages can also be misleading even when based \non a complete sample. The \u201eentire dictionary\u201f line in figure 3 appears to reveal \nconsiderable fluctuation in the provision of unattributed examples of use in Hotten\u201fs \ndictionary, but only the increase between the letters \u201eE\u201f and \u201eF\u201f and the decrease \nbetween \u201eV\u201f and \u201eW\u201f are statistically significant (both p=0.01). However, neither the \ndifferences between \u201eD\u201f and \u201eG\u201f nor those between \u201eU\u201f and \u201eXYZ\u201f are statistically \nsignificant. Analysing this dictionary letter by letter thus identifies inconsistencies but \nnot trends: for a small sample, which is unavoidable when working on a small \ndictionary, grouping letters together can produce more meaningful results than \ntreating them separately. \n \nINSERT FIGURES 1, 2, 3 and Tables 4, 5, 6 here \n \n2.3 Choosing a dictionary text.  \n \nAny meaningful comparative analysis of dictionaries must compare like with like, i.e. \nthe dictionaries must be comparable in content and type (synchronic, diachronic, \nregister, specialism, etc.) or linked by textual dependency. The choice between print \nand electronic versions, if available, must be made with reference to the advantages \nand disadvantages of each.  \nSearching electronically has the benefits of saving time and allowing the \nanalysis of an entire text. However, the researcher has to be sensitive to shortcomings \nor inconsistencies inherent in a text which may not have been written with electronic \nsearching in mind. The combination of inconsistent lexicographic practice and an \nunsophisticated search engine may result in distorted results (see footnote 3). It is \ntherefore vital to assess all possible permutations and variations of a search term. For \nexample, a researcher wanting to examine OED Online in order to determine the total \n 8 \nnumber of words that have entered English from French,\n6\n would first need to assess \nthe consistency of language names, spellings, and abbreviations within the etymology \nfield. Although the third edition of OED (OED3; Simpson 2000\u2013) is consistent in its \nrepresentation of French etymons, unedited entries from the second edition (OED2; \nSimpson and Weiner 1989) are not. OED Online combines material from OED2 and \nOED3, and therefore uses the full form \u201eFrench\u201f in etymologies (16,436 times), as \nwell as \u201eFr.\u201f (4827), and \u201eF.\u201f7 The results of an electronic search for French \netymologies in OED Online might be interpreted as showing certain linguistic \npatterns of borrowing, or as proving that one editor favoured (or neglected) words of \nFrench provenance, whereas the differences could actually be the result of an \nindividual preference for an abbreviation that the researcher failed to anticipate.  \nAn added complication is that the current OED Online search engine cannot \ndiscriminate between words that occur as language names (eg. < French) and those \nthat occur in other contexts within the etymology field. For example, a search for the \nword \u201eFrench\u201f in the etymology field would include the entry for Ringelmann among \nits results. This is not from French, but bears the etymology \u201eOf uncertain attribution; \nperh. the name of Maximilien Ringelmann (1861\u20131931), French scientist\u201f. Similar \nissues exist for inconsistencies in labelling and in bibliographic representation of \nauthor names, titles, and editions. OED Online is working to iron out these \ninconsistencies, but researchers must be aware that the periodic release of updated \nportions produces a dictionary that is dynamic and mutable, and painstakingly \ncompiled results will inevitably be brought into question by the next quarterly \ninstalment. \nData collection from a print version, although time-consuming, does have \ncertain advantages. Researchers using electronic resources will perform only those \nqueries that occur to them and, even with careful vetting of the results, will examine \nonly a small proportion of the data available. Print-readers have serendipity on their \nside, inconsistencies can be accounted for, and hunches can be explored to determine \nwhether there is any statistical significance in casually observed trends. A print \nversion also allows the researcher to assess markers and symbols (such as daggers, \nasterisks, or tramlines) that indicate style or usage and may not be searchable \nelectronically (Osselton 2006).  \n \n2.4 Quantitative analysis.  \n 9 \nOnce the contents of a dictionary have been reduced to countable features and the \nresearcher has determined which sample and parameters of analysis are needed for the \nspecific case study, it is possible to compare and analyze them statistically. In \ndictionary comparisons it is particularly important for the researcher to calibrate all \ncalculations in order to account for differences in size and content of the respective \ntexts. For example, if a single volume dictionary is compared with a multi-volume \nwork, the researcher must not automatically assume that there is a direct proportional \nrelationship between their relative sizes. For example, the second OED Supplement \n(Burchfield 1972\u20131986) is four volumes and the first (Craigie and Onions 1933) a \nsingle volume, but it would be wrong to assume that the former is four times the size \nof the latter. In fact, Burchfield\u201fs supplement has an average of 14 entries per page, \ncompared with 28 entries per page in the 1933 supplement, amounting to a ratio not \nof 4:1, but 2:1. The relative sizes of each letter of the alphabet should also be factored \ninto calculations in order to give proportional figures that account for dictionary \nfatigue and the fact that some letters, such as C and S, account for a disproportionate \nnumber of English words. \n Databases offer convenient tools for the organization and quantitative analysis \nof data. Each row in the database table can represent a dictionary sense division, and \neach column a lexical or lexicographic feature (see 2.1). For example, Table 7 \nrepresents a short range of entries from Partridge\u201fs Dictionary of Slang and \nUnconventional English (1937). The complete sample consists of 2086 sense \ndivisions for 1715 headwords from the main alphabetical listing of approximately \n55,800 sense divisions for 41,200 headwords: \n \nINSERT Table 7 here \n \nHaving constructed this table, the researcher can use the database\u201fs query \nlanguage to interrogate the evidence and correlate variables. These queries are quickly \nconstructed and instantaneously executed, making it possible to explore correlations \ncompletely beyond the scope of mechanical analysis. For example, a comparison \nbetween \u201ename\u201f and \u201edate1\u201f, sorted on \u201ename\u201f, exposes Partridge\u201fs dating techniques: \none of his sources is Fenton\u201fs Bush Life in Tasmania Fifty Years Ago, published in \n1891, and words supported by reference to Fenton are generally dated to the mid-\nnineteenth century. Partridge\u201fs practice in this respect is clearly deductive rather than \n 10 \nevidence-based, and the format of these dates implies that they are based on careful \nconsideration of a wider range of documentary evidence than was actually available. \n \n2.4.1 Bidirectional source analysis. Tables constructed from individual \ndictionaries can be modified to allow comparison between related dictionaries. For \nexample, the binary yes\/no column \u201eFandH\u201f in Table 7 indicates terms that are also in \nFarmer and Henley\u201fs Slang and its Analogues, which Partridge had been \ncommissioned to update. The addition of this column allows the composition of the \nresulting dictionary to be explored with reference to its actual rather than claimed use \nof its sources: \n \nit may be assumed for the period up to 1904, and where no author or \ndictionary is quoted, the debt is, in most instances, to Farmer and Henley \n(Partridge 1937: x) \n \nPartridge sometimes obscures his use of Slang and its Analogues by re-using its \ncitations. For instance, in the sample entries in Table 7, the references to Swift and \nFielding (in the entry for tace is Latin for a candle) and Foote (tack together) are all \nderived from Farmer and Henley, though that dictionary is not named as a source in \neither case. Comparison between the two dictionaries also throws light upon \nPartridge\u201fs \u201eineligible\u201f words, which he lists in square brackets to justify their \nexclusion. Most prove to be terms that had been listed in Farmer and Henley, \nindicating that although Partridge was willing to disagree with his main source, he felt \nthe need to defend these editorial decisions individually and in some detail.  \nTable 7 can also be modified to explore the use made of Partridge (1937) by \nlater dictionaries. For example, the \u201e1961\u201f column shows which entries survived into \nthe abridged Smaller Slang Dictionary. The principles underlying the abridgement are \nexplained (Partridge 1961: vii): terms obsolete before 1900 were omitted, as were all \nindelicate terms. These claims are borne out by the evidence, but terms labelled as \nsolecisms (such as tack 4) were also silently omitted regardless of their currency or \noffensiveness, as were \u201eineligible\u201f and non-lexical entries. The non-lexical entries \nlargely comment on pronunciation and grammar, but a few are encyclopaedic in \nnature. Drawing attention to these omissions might have forced Partridge to address \ntheir claim to inclusion in the unabridged work (see Coleman forthcoming, ch.1). \nFormatted: Indent: First line:  1.27\ncm\n 11 \nIt is unusual for lexicographers to select from earlier dictionaries entirely \nrandomly. For example, Coleman (2004c) demonstrated that, using B. E.\u201fs A New \nDictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew (c.1698) as a \nsource, later dictionaries (Smith 1719, the anonymous New Canting Dictionary  of \n1725, and Grose 1785) all display a statistically significant preference for entries \nlabelled as \u201ecant\u201f. The New Canting Dictionary and Grose also have a statistically \nsignificant preference for terms belonging to the semantic fields of CRIME AND \nPUNISHMENT, SEX, and POVERTY, regardless of their usage label. In addition, entries \nnot labelled as \u201ecant\u201f but including citations were included in Grose\u201fs dictionary at a \nsignificantly higher rate. Similarly, Hotten (1859) demonstrates a statistically \nsignificant preference for entries including cited authorities when he makes his \nselection from Egan\u201fs (1823) edition of Grose\u201fs dictionary (Coleman 2008: 18\u201319). \nGrose and Hotten both attempted to excuse the disreputable content of their \ndictionaries by emphasizing their scholarly credentials, but statistical analysis \ndemonstrates that they both preferred their research pre-packaged. \n \n2.5 Sharing data.  \n \nAlthough statistical analysis involves the use of more rigorous techniques than \nimpressionistic dictionary studies, there still remains an element of subjectivity. Even \nwhere researchers describe their methodology in careful detail, there is frequently an \nelement of judgement involved in applying that methodology: Is \u201eGypsy\u201f a usage \nlabel or an etymology in this entry? Does \u201eScott\u201f necessarily refer to the author of \nIvanhoe? Is \u201ethieves\u201f pidgin\u201f the same as \u201ecant\u201f? Is this definition based on that one in \nan earlier dictionary? It would, therefore, be unwise to use data compiled by another \nresearcher as a basis for comparison without careful re-analysis to explore their \nmethodology. For example, in her edition of a glossary of the slang used by \nAustralian troops during the First World War, Laugesen (online) indicates terms \nadopted from an earlier dictionary (Downing 1919). However, upon comparison of \nthe two lists, it is clear that Laugesen has only marked entries that were borrowed \nverbatim, and Downing\u201fs influence is considerably greater than this suggests \n(Coleman 2008: 253). Without close re-analysis of the data, scholars run the risk of \nbasing their conclusions on unsuspected differences in methodology and analysis.  \n \n 12 \n3. The Forensic Approach: Combining statistical analysis with contextual and \nqualitative research \n \nStatistical analysis can highlight trends and patterns of lexicographic practice, but it \ncannot always explain the policies and motivations behind them. It is therefore \nessential, where possible, to supplement statistical analysis with general knowledge of \nthe textual tradition and historical period to which the dictionary belongs, and to \ncombine this with information gleaned from a combination of other sources. These \nwill vary from dictionary to dictionary, but may include prefaces and introductions, \npublicity material, reviews and responses to reviews, editorial notes, dictionary \nproofs, slips, unpublished lectures, diaries, marginalia, or correspondence with \npublishers, readers, and consultants.  \nThe dictionary-making process can involve many layers and stages of editing \nbefore the final product emerges. This process is sometimes preserved on dictionary \nslips or proofs that show additions and corrections by various contributors to multi-\neditor dictionaries. These not only reveal who constructed the entry, or worked on \ndifferent parts of it, but they can also uncover discussions between editors explaining \ncertain editorial decisions (Morton 1994, Reddick 1996, Gilliver 2004, Mugglestone \n2005). Quotational slips can give insights into whether or not a particular text was \ndeliberately requested by an editor. This can indicate an editor\u201fs feeling that a subject, \nauthor, literary genre, or source language was worthy of particular attention. \nDictionary proofs showing hand-written marginalia, deletions, comments, and \nmessages between editors can show dissent amongst editors or differences in editing \nstyles, and can provide insights into last-minute decision-making by which we can \ngauge editorial priorities (Mugglestone 2003, 2005).  \nCorrespondence between editors and publishers can reveal stresses between \nscholarship and commerce which may affect editorial practice: usually pressure to \nspeed up progress or to save space, but sometimes to exclude certain types of words. \nFor example, Murray\u201fs draft of the first section of the OED, A\u2013ANT, was sent back \nto him by the OUP Delegates with instructions to omit \u201eAardvark, Aardwolf, Ab2, \nAba, [and] Abaca\u201f for no apparent reason other than their loan status. Gilliver (2007) \nused archival documents to show the pressure that OUP exerted on William Craigie to \nspeed up progress and to save space while he edited the letter U in OED1. The \ncompetitive and territorial side of lexicography, involving disputes of recognition and \n 13 \nauthorship, is also evident in correspondence among the editors of the Dictionary of \nAmerican English (Adams 1995, 1998) and the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Ogilvie \n2008b).  \nComparison between the final text and letters from dictionary consultants can \nalso reveal influences on policy and practice. Whether or not editors act on advice \nprovided by a consultant can give added insight into attitudes and policies. For \nexample, in a letter to James Murray dated 1886, the Oxford anthropologist E. B. \nTylor questioned whether or not the \u201eoutlandish\u201f word boyuna \u201ea large black Brazilian \nsnake\u201f had any place in an English dictionary. The fact that Murray ignored his \nconsultant\u201fs advice indicated that his definition of \u201eEnglish\u201f was broader than Tylor\u201fs \n(Ogilvie 2008a: 28). \nDelving beyond the dictionary text into archival materials can also give new \ninsights into the reasons for certain lexicographic practice. For example, in both \nOED1 and Burchfield's OED Supplement, two small parallel lines or 'tramlines' were \nplaced beside headwords that the editors considered 'alien or not yet naturalized'. The \nabsence of tramlines in the 1933 OED Supplement initially suggested a printer\u201fs error, \nbut an internal memo found in the OUP archive suggested that it was a conscious \npolicy decision influenced by the Society for Pure English of which the editors were \nmembers (Ogilvie 2008b). Similarly, the fact that Charles Onions included five times \nmore loanwords than William Craigie in the 1933 OED Supplement could have been \ncoincidence. However, letters found in the OUP archive between the Press and the \nAmerican journalist H. L. Mencken show that Onions had a disposition towards \nfocussing on loanwords, while a letter from James Wyllie provides an insight into \nCraigie\u201fs more restrictive policy.8  \nWhile it is useful to be attentive to archival documentation in order to shed \nmore light on policies and practices, it is also important not to read too much into \nsuch discoveries. For example, there is a three-fold increase in Chinese words in \nBurchfield\u201fs OED Supplement (1972\u20131986) after the letter N. Archival documents \nreveal that this coincided with a trip to China made by the editor in 1979. However, it \nalso coincided with a natural bias in the Chinese sound system for words beginning \nwith letters in the latter half of the English alphabet, published after 1979 (O-Scz \npublished in 1982 and Se-Z published in 1986), so further analysis would be \nnecessary to determine how profoundly the editor\u201fs visit to China influenced his \ntreatment of Chinese words.\n9\n  \n 14 \n \n3.1 Overcoming the limitations of contextual and qualitative research \n \nClearly there are limits to contextual and qualitative dictionary research. The \nresearcher must be alert to the possibility that the version of events presented by a \nlexicographer is not always a true reflection of actual practice. In-house documents \nmay represent good intentions or attempts to bridge differences in practice rather than \napplied policy. A dictionary\u201fs preface may represent policies applied consistently \nthroughout its production, or it may represent policies that the editor wished had \nalways been in place, or thought that reviewers or readers might expect to have been \nin place. Changes in political climate may also influence the published claims made \nfor a dictionary. For example, Burchfield wrote that: \n \nReaders will discover by constant use of the Supplement that the written \nEnglish of regions like Australia, South Africa, and India have been accorded \nthe kind of treatment that lexicographers of a former generation might have \nreserved for the English of Britain alone (Burchfield 1972: xv). \n \nThese claims have generally been accepted without question, but a close examination \nof the dictionary reveals them to be untrue. He had, in fact, deleted 17% of loanwords \nand terms from World Englishes included in the 1933 Supplement, and added only \nhalf as many words from outside Britain as his predecessor, Onions (Ogilvie 2008a). \nLexicographers\u201f misrepresentation of their methodology and sources is \nsometimes clearly mendacious. For example, Grose (1785: vii) claimed in his preface \nthat he had omitted obscene terms wherever possible, and that where their inclusion \nwas unavoidable he had \u201eendeavoured to get rid of [indecent and immodest words] in \nthe most decent manner possible\u201f. However, terms pertaining to SEX in Grose\u201fs \nsources are considerably more likely to appear in his own dictionary than non-sexual \nvocabulary (Coleman 2004b: 19, 31\u20132). Asserting the superiority of one\u201fs own \ndictionary is commonplace, but Hotten\u201fs (1859: 153) description of Ducange \nAnglicus\u201fs Vulgar Tongue as \u201esilly and childish\u201f was presumably intended to disguise \nhis own extensive use of it (Coleman 2008: 18\u201319). \n \n4. Conclusions \nFormatted: Indent: First line:  1.27\ncm\n 15 \nForensic dictionary analysis brings together statistical, textual and contextual \napproaches that allow dictionary researchers to examine, understand, and reconstruct \nlexicographic practices and policies. This paper has presented various techniques for \nforensic lexicography that allow the researcher to interrogate dictionary texts \nthemselves about the decision-making processes involved in their compilation. It has \nalso explored some of the pitfalls of electronic searching and of various sampling \ntechniques. Forensic dictionary analysis builds on a variety of previous research \nmethods, suggesting that the best way to analyze and contextualize a dictionary is by \nmeans of a synthesis of qualitative and contextual research with rigorous statistical \nanalysis.  \n \n \nNotes\n \n1. Sarah Ogilvie would like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council \nand the Wingate Foundation for funds to pursue this research, which was \ncarried out whilst she was a Visiting Fellow at the Research School of \nHumanities and the Australian National Dictionary Centre, Australian \nNational University.  \n2. One lexicographer's description of the evolution of his own policy and \npractice can be found in Botha (2005). \n3. A simple search of OED Online (accessed 24\/09\/2008) for each author\u201fs name \nas \u201efirst cited author\u201f would apparently prove that Shakespeare (1881 hits) \ncreated three times more neologisms than Milton (628) (based on a search for \n'Shak*' in 'first cited author' to allow for OED's spelling variants, Shakespeare \nand Shakes.). But these results would have to consider the OED\u201fs unusually \nthorough treatment of Shakespeare (Jespersen 1905: \u00a7224, Sch\u00e4fer 1980), and \ntake into account the fact that the number of neologisms drops by 40% if \nhapax legomena are factored out of the equation (Goodland 2008). The results \n 16 \nwould also require manual checking to ensure that the authors corresponded to \nWilliam Shakespeare (1564\u20131616) and John Milton (1608\u20131674). For \nexample, the results included mascarpone 'Italian cheese', which the OED \nattests was first used in English by Arthur Milton in Rome in Seven Days. \n4. Researchers might be tempted to break samples down into smaller units, such \nas individual letters, but in a dictionary with a few thousand headwords only \nbroader-stroke analyses will produce statistically significant results (see \nSection 2.2). \n5. Hotten\u201fs lists of rhyming slang, back slang, and costermongers\u201f terms for \nmoney are omitted from these calculations. \n6. A study of this scale was proposed by Moss\u00e9 (1943: 34) long before it was \npracticable. \n7. OED Online (accessed 24\/09\/2008). A search for \u201eF.\u201f in 'etymologies' \n\u201eetymologies\u201f produced hits for both the abbreviation F. \u201eFrench\u201f and for the \nabbreviation f. \u201efrom\u201f, totalling 117,292. \n8. A fuller comparison of the differences between Onions\u201f and Craigie\u201fs \ntreatment of loanwords is found in Ogilvie (2008a). See also Brewer (2007b: \n24\u201333) for a general account of the differences between their working \npractices. \n9. See Ogilvie (2008a: 35) for a fuller discussion of Chinese words in the OED \nSupplement (Burchfield 1972\u20131986). We are indebted to Mike Clark of the \nChinese-English Oxford Dictionary Project for verification that the longest \nletters in the Chinese dictionary are S, X, Y, and Z. \n \nReferences \nA.
