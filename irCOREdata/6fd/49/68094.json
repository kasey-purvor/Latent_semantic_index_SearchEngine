It is argued that to understand \nmaterial culture as determined through the monetary exchange for things - the \ncash nexus - leads to an inadequate sociological understanding of the social \nrelations with objects. The work of Jean Baudrillard is used both to critique the \nconcept of consumption as it leads to a focus on advertising, choice, money \nand shopping and to point to a more sociologically adequate approach to \nmaterial culture that explores objects in a system of models and series, \n\u2018atmosphere\u2019, functionality, biography, interaction and mediation.   \nKeywords: consumption, material culture, Baudrillard, cash nexus, quasi-\nsocial \nWord length: 5840 for text and endnotes (6946 including title page, biography, \nabstract, and bibliography) \n 3 \nIntroduction \nThe topic of \u2018consumption\u2019 has become, particularly within the fields of \nsociology (Campbell 1987; Bocock 1993; Slater 1997; Corrigan 1997; Lury \n1997; Miles 1998), psychology (Lunt and Livingstone 1992; Dittmar 1992) and \nanthropology, (Isherwood and Douglas 1979: Appadurai 1986: McCracken \n1990, Miller 1987; 1995; 1998) a key way of thinking about contemporary \ncultures and in particular the material culture of modern societies. But the way \nthat \u2018consumption\u2019 tends to be understood is, I wish to suggest, all too often \nconcerned with the social features of the economic process of exchanging \ncash for goods or commodities - what I am going to call the \u2018cash nexus\u2019. The \nidea of consumption tends to treat the complexity of social relationships that \nconstitute material culture as consequent on the key social action of buying \nand selling. I will argue that material culture is best understood as realised \nthrough the 'quasi-social' relationships that people have with objects - \nrelationships to do with the meanings of, and interaction with, the object that \nare not determined by the cash nexus. \nIn this paper I want to argue that a focus of attention has shifted from the \nsphere of production, that was at the centre of concern in the United Kingdom \nof the 1970s, to the sphere of consumption. Just as the discussion of that time \nabout the affluence of workers and the relations of production became \nimpacted around the issue of cash payments to labour so the discussion of \nconsumption and relationships between the material things people \nappropriate into their lives has recently become impacted around the payment \nof cash for commodities. \n 4 \nThe affluent society \nThe discussion of consumption, within sociology at least, has grown out of the \nattempt to grasp the nature of what J.K. Galbraith famously called the \u2018affluent \nsociety\u2019 (1962 [1958]). He argued that the social and economic organisation of \nmodern societies needed to leave behind the myth of the centrality of \nproduction together with a set of ideas about needs and wants that derived \nfrom the experience of poverty and insufficiency. In its place he argued for the \nimportance of the creation and management of consumer demand, providing \na brutalist vision of political economy in which the forces of the market \nindicated the moral as well as the economic order: \u201cNo tears should be \nwasted on the farmers who go bankrupt. This is the path to more efficient farm \nproduction\u201d (Galbraith 1958: 235). The response of sociology was of course \nmore cautious, recognising that the moral order could not so easily be \nunderstood by appeal to abstractions such as efficiency. Galbraith was \narticulating the economic forces that operated in the affluent society but he \nhad little to say about the feelings, attitudes, relationships, sense of identity, \ngroupings or everyday lives of the people in that society. Nonetheless, his \nargument that attention needed to be shifted from the field of production to \nthat of consumption was compelling.  \nIf Galbraith\u2019s argument was about the management of demand, the \nsociological response, especially in a very fertile period of sociology in the \nUnited Kingdom, was to consider what happens to the worker in the affluent \nsociety. The attitudes and responses of the worker were not simply economic; \nthey were also political and social. While the power of the worker could be \nseen to be diminishing in terms of influencing the process of production, the \n 5 \naffluence of the worker became crucial to the sustaining of demand. The \naffluent society depended on the influence of the producers over the needs \nand wants - material, economic, social and political - of the worker: \nMost goods serve needs that are discovered to the individual not by the \npalpable discomfort that accompanies deprivation, but by some psychic \nresponse to their possession. They give him (sic) a sense of personal \nachievement, accord him (sic) a feeling of equality with his (sic) \nneighbors, divert his (sic) mind from thought, serve sexual aspiration, \npromise social acceptability, enhance his (sic) subjective feeling of \nhealth, well-being or orderly peristalsis, contribute by conventional \ncanons to personal beauty, or are otherwise psychologically rewarding. \n(Galbraith 1967: 201)   \nFor Galbraith and the \u2018ad-men\u2019 the problem was seen as psychological but the \nshift in orientation to production and consumption that he was describing \nwould have dramatic effects on social structure; on social class, status, \ncommunity and identity. It was the selling of goods that Galbraith saw as the \ndynamic of affluent society; the exchanging of cash for manufactured \ncommodities. This cash nexus, I wish to argue, has become the dominant \nconcern of the social sciences that address \u2018consumption\u2019 - the mechanics of \nselling determine the form of consumer society. But first I will comment on the \ncritical history of the \u2018cash nexus\u2019. \nThe cash nexus \nI first came across Marx\u2019s use of the phrase the \u2018cash nexus\u2019 when, as an \nundergraduate, I read an article by John Westergaard, published in 1970 \ncalled \u201cThe Rediscovery of the Cash Nexus\u201d. For Westergaard and other \nMarxist commentators, the structure of contemporary society could be \n 6 \nunderstood through a study of the dynamics of class formation and the \nrelations of production. He identified in a number of studies1, most importantly \nthe famous The Affluent Worker survey of Luton car workers, (Goldthorpe et \nal. 1968), a rediscovery of what Marx and Engels called in The Manifesto of \nthe Communist Party, the \u2018nexus of cash payments\u2019. In borrowing the phrase \nfrom Thomas Carlyle2, Marx and Engels were making the point that the - \nalbeit unequal - reciprocal obligations of feudal and patriarchal relations were \nreplaced by the \"naked self-interest\" of \"cash payments\" in bourgeois, \ncapitalist society (Marx and Engels 1968:38) \nFor Westergaard the capitalism of the 1950s and 1960s had produced an \namorphous class of affluent, privatised and instrumental workers with no clear \nsocial or cultural form. The community oriented but fragmented working class \nof early industrial capitalism in which the worker was connected to the social \nstructure through a commitment to work and to fellow workers, was replaced \nby the formal link of cash for labour. The cash nexus had become the \u201cmain \nbond that tied many people to the social order\u201d (Westergaard and Resler \n1975: 6) early in the development of capitalism and by the 1970s had become \ncharacteristic of the relations of production. The cash nexus was capitalism at \nwork; rewarding labour for producing goods efficiently with increasingly high \nwages but no industrial or political power. \nIt was of course precisely in this climate of sociology that consumption began \nto be an issue - the increasing wages of some workers under capitalism \nneeded to be spent somewhere and the mass-produced goods needed to be \nsold. The empirical studies and sociological analyses of the \u2018affluent society\u2019 \nand of the embourgeoisement of workers were beginning to describe social \n 7 \nstructure as formed not simply in the relations of production but also in the \nrelations of consumption3.  \nIn the same year as Westergaard\u2019s article appeared in English, in France \nJean Baudrillard\u2019s La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Consommation was published. Although an \nEnglish edition has only very recently been published (1998 [1970])4, I want to \naccuse Baudrillard with having put a version of consumption into the field of \nsociology that has a focus on the cash nexus. He specifically responds to \nGalbraith\u2019s concept of the affluent society to argue that it is better understood \nas a \u2018consumer society\u2019. Baudrillard began to raise the issues of consumption \nin the final quarter of his earlier The System of Objects (1996 [1968]), but I \nwant to use some of the ideas in the first three quarters of that book to begin \nto recover material culture beyond the cash nexus for sociological study. It \nseems quite appropriate in English to read Baudrillard backwards since his \nlater work was translated before his earlier work! \nIn the remainder of this paper I will firstly explore what I mean by consumption \nat the cash nexus. Then I will suggest some alternative ways of approaching \nthe material culture of modern societies. Thirdly I will reprise Baudrillard\u2019s \nconsumption theory, by arguing that he is not studying consumption as a \nsocial practice but critiquing the form of consumer society. \nConsumption and the cash nexus \nMy problem with consumption is not that it is not a proper concern for \nsociology or that it is dull or irrelevant. It is that the sociological study of \nmaterial culture has emerged within theories and studies of consumption and \nbecause of this is organised around a group of topics that are directed \nprimarily to the buying and selling of objects. The effect is that the social \n 8 \nrelations between human society and material things that constitute material \nculture appear to be determined by the cash nexus. Just as the cash nexus of \nthe affluent worker studies that Westergaard criticised did not adequately \naccount for changes in social and political structures, so the cash nexus in \nconsumption is inadequate to understand the development of contemporary \nmaterial culture.  \nAs the topic of consumption was taken up in British sociology, there was a \nconcern with its historical emergence and its relation to traditional modes of \nunderstanding modernity, especially those of Weber (Campbell 1987) and \nMarx (Bocock 1993). From the anthropological tradition however, attention \nfocused on the connections between the economic notion of consumption as \nan exchange of goods and the consequent exchange of meanings which \nwould constitute culture (Sahlins 1976; Douglas and Isherwood 1979). Miller \nbrought the themes of modernity in Hegel, Marx and Simmel together with \nthose of meaning and culture (1987). In articulating consumption as a central \nfeature of contemporary cultures, this sociological and anthropological \ntradition also identified consumption as the social practice in which human \nrelationships with material culture are established. Within this tradition the \nimpact of consumption has been seen as linked to the shaping of \u2018postmodern \nculture\u2019 (Featherstone 1991) through an \u2018ideology of consumerism\u2019 (Bocock \n1993) that has led to a consumerist \u2018way of life\u2019 (Miles 1998). These cool \nsociological accounts of how late modern society is, describe a social world \ndominated by the buying of goods and services but without the critical irony of \nBaudrillard's much earlier description of the consumer society. The British \naccount of consumption does however share a set of concerns with \n 9 \nBaudrillard that tie the analysis of consumption back into the economic \nconcern with purchasing of goods - I will mention four. \nThe first and most pervasive theme is that of the image of the object; the \nconcern with advertising, with the presentation of objects, their novelty, their \ndistinctiveness (see e.g. McCracken 1990; Featherstone 1991; Corrigan \n1997; Lury 1996; Slater 1996). Here the pressures to sell goods are often \ntaken as equivalent to the goods themselves; advertisements are taken to be \nmore adequate representations of the objects than the objects themselves. \nThe meanings formed in advertisements by associations between things for \nsale and other things which already have cultural value is taken to be \nexchanged in the process of consumption. Baudrillard sets the pattern by \nsprinkling his argument not with traditional forms of sociological evidence but \nwith quotations of the impacted, sub-poetic language of advertisements \n(1998).  \nSecondly, there is the key issue of choice (e.g. Lury 1997; Slater 1997) \nthrough which consumers demonstrate their taste and social standing. \nThrough deciding when and if to part with cash and for which of a range of \ngoods, individuals appear to be using a blend of knowledge, experience, \nimagination and fantasy to express personal choice, relatively independent of \nthe determinants of the mode of production5. Of course the counter argument \nhas been put from the beginning by a series of commentators (including Leiss \n1978; Haug 1986; Jhally 1987; Ewen and Ewen 1992) that consumption is \ndetermined in large measure by the forces of production through processes \nsuch as advertising. However, it is not unreasonable to argue as Gabriel and \nLang (1995) do that this case is grossly overstated; consumers are not \n 10 \ninfinitely available to be duped and manipulated and their identity cannot \nshaped or read-off from the commodities they choose.   \nNonetheless, the possibility for voluntarily expressing identity with, for \nexample, a youth sub-cultural group or a sophisticated fashionable clique \nthrough consumption, has attracted the attention of sociologists (e.g. Lury \n1996: 192-225). Choice in consumption is, for some commentators (e.g. Miller \n1995: 39-48), a quasi-political act in which the citizen expresses their approval \nor not of the actions of a range of social institutions. Again this theme is put \ninto play in Baudrillard\u2019s discussion of personalisation, of the way \ncommodities and advertisements hail the individual consumer, making them \nfeel unique and distinct but simultaneously fitting them into a social structural \nniche of consumer categories (1998: 87-98).  \nThirdly is money itself. It is at the end of The System of Objects that \nBaudrillard discusses \u2018credit\u2019; buying the postponement of the cash nexus is a \nfeature of consumer societies (1996: 156-163). He returns to the theme briefly \nin The Consumer Society (1998: 29, 81).  Within the contemporary debate on \nconsumption the issue of money has become linked to commerce (Slater \n1997: 22), saving (Douglas and Isherwood 1979: 11-35), credit and credit \ncards (Lunt and Livingstone 1992: 192) and thrift (Miller 1998a: 49-62, 132-\n137). Limited cash resources are distributed by consumers in particular ways \nthat are taken to reflect their engagement with society. Bargain hunting is one \nof the ways that the significance of cash is experienced in the cash nexus of \nconsumption. For Daniel Miller (1998a) looking for bargains is the modern \nform of ritual sacrifice, enacted daily in the routines of provisioning in the high \nstreet mini-market: \n 11 \n. . . it is possible for shoppers to regard virtually the whole of the \nshopping expedition and the purchase of almost any specific item \nwithin that expedition, not as an act of spending at all, but as an act of \nsaving. \n(Miller 1998a: 56). \nThe fourth and increasingly central theme is the field of shopping itself, not \nonly the activity of shopping but the scene of shopping; the mall, the \ndepartment store, the home-shopping brochure and so on (e.g. Shields 1992; \nCorrigan 1997: 50-65; Falk and Campbell 1998; Miller et al. 1998b). Here it is \nthe context that is taken for the object; it derives its meaning from the \nsurroundings in which it is purchased and it in turn marks the identity of its \npurchaser. Baudrillard sets this topic in motion with his discussion of the \n\u2018drugstore\u2019 and the way that items are presented for sale; neither en masse \nnor systematically arranged as in the department store, but arrayed alongside \neach other, different classes and types of product, for different purchase at \ndifferent times (Baudrillard 1996). This characteristically postmodern vision of \norder in decline, of what appears to be chaotically different in one glance \nbeing so much more of the same in the next, has given way to recoveries and \nanalyses of all the myriad other contexts for doing shopping. \nMaterial culture \nMy argument is not against the sociological study of consumption as such - \nthe themes of image, choice, money, and shopping context, have produced \ninteresting and valuable work that needs to be put alongside the 1960s \nanalyses of the situations of affluent workers. Moreover, I recognise that all \nthe commentators on consumption I have mentioned are also interested to \nvarying degrees with material culture. What I am arguing is that their account \n 12 \nof material culture, the meanings and uses of objects, derives from their \nunderstanding of objects through the medium of the cash nexus. \nConsumption theorists seem to accept that the substantive relationship with \nobjects begins and is in large measure determined by the management of \nwant and the expression of choice realised when money is exchanged for \ngoods during shopping.  \nI want to argue that there are other practices of living with objects that can be \nmore important in understanding material culture than those that are \nassociated with consumption as purchase. I will briefly mention a number of \nthemes but, for a change of pace, will wind them into a short narrative6. \nIn my kitchen is a knife that I estimate to be twenty-seven years old - I came \nby it around the time Westergaard\u2019s article and Baudrillard\u2019s book were being \npublished7. A little while later I had an argument with the live-in girlfriend of the \nperson I shared a flat with about who owned it. She maintained that the knife \nwas given to her by her parents in Surrey and had been with her through \nuniversity at Exeter, survived a relationship in Sussex and come with her to \nLondon. My story was that I remembered buying it in Reading from whence it \nhad travelled with me to Stoke and later to Portsmouth and then on to \nLondon. Now I definitely remember buying a knife, but to be honest, I\u2019m not \nnow at all sure whether it was this knife. At the time I was sure that it was \nmine, and as I moved out of the flat I argued forcefully enough to win the \nargument - or at least the knife8. \nSo there may have been no cash nexus - I probably came by the knife by \nsome sort of misappropriation, in which there was no exchange of cash, no \nshopping, no image of the object prior to me living with it and my choice of it \n 13 \nwas based on my everyday relationship with it. Even if the knife was the one I \nhad bought, it was cheap and would not have required saving, budgeting, \ncredit or loans. The shopping experience had not shaped the knife that I used \nand liked; I had not been seduced by advertisements or brand names9. The \nact of buying such a knife did in some way symbolise my identity; it was a \nvery early purchase of household equipment linked to leaving my parents\u2019 \nhome and learning to cook and fend for myself. But this cannot be grasped by \nlooking at the knife itself, treating it as an image or by considering the \nshopping context in which it was bought and sold.  \nThe tendency of consumption analysis is to emphasise these features but I \nwish to argue that to derive the meaning and significance of material culture - \nthe mass of objects, such as my kitchen knife, that we live with and use - from \nthe cash nexus is sociologically inadequate. We need to study the complex of \nsocial relationships, the \u2018system of objects\u2019, into which such objects as my \nkitchen knife are fitted. For Baudrillard the system of objects is not concerned \nwith defining them functionally but \u201c. . . instead with the processes whereby \npeople relate to them and with the systems of human behaviour and \nrelationships that result therefrom\u201d (1996: 4). He argues that unlike language \nor even a technological account of objects, this process is not simply one of \nclassification that needs to be periodically updated, it is constantly being \nmodified and disturbed by the \u201cdirectly experienced psychological and \nsociological reality of objects\u201d (Baudrillard 1996: 8). In my story of the knife it \nis tied to the places where it was lived with and the people that used it - these \nare the social contexts in which it was (and is!) incorporated into a system of \nobjects. \n 14 \nOne of the key conceptual tools Baudrillard develops is the tension between \nmodel10 and series, the tension between the personalised, singular \ncharacteristics of the object and the cultural system of differences in which it \nis recognised (1996: 140). To begin with it was the only sharp knife I owned \nand moved with me in furnished accommodation (I\u2019ve counted five houses \nsince London) because landlords never provide sharp knives. It was at that \npoint a model - dark wooden handle, stainless blade, sharp point, \nsharpenable blade - distinctive in the drawer alongside series of plastic \nhandled knives with thin, scalloped but unsharpenable blades. It later became \npart of a series as other similar knives were acquired - it has five or six \ncompanions in the drawer now.  \nAs well as demonstrating ideal characteristics alongside lesser serial objects, \nthe knife has always contributed to what Baudrillard calls \u2018atmosphere\u2019 \nthrough being; traditional in style and materials, simple in design, not a \ngadget, not decorated and visibly functional. The manner of its use is declared \nin the contrast between the dark warmth of the natural wood of the part to be \nheld and the thin, cold, angled and reflective surfaces of the operational end \n(Baudrillard 1996: 30-41). At the same time the knife is a \u2018functional\u2019 rather \nthan a ritual or symbolic object, although fitted into a wide range of culinary \npractices (cutting up meat, salad, fruit, vegetables, in the kitchen, at the diner \ntable, at the picnic) rather than limited to one context or purpose (like the \nbreadknife or fishknife) (Baudrillard 1996: 17-18, 110-112). \nThe biography of the knife is linked to my biography not only in the \ngeographical moves I\u2019ve made but also the types of household I\u2019ve lived in. It \nhas shared the drawer with the knives of landlords, flat sharers, lovers and \n 15 \npartners. In its early useful life it cut up meat four or five times a week. For the \npast few years it has not touched meat and seldom sees the inside of a \nvegetable; it mainly gets to slice a tomato or peel a pear. This is not the sort of \nbiography that Igor Kopytoff (1988) describes, who, having suggested that \nownership and use is important, rapidly moves on to talk about arenas of \nexchange and the revaluation of objects in the cash nexus. But it is a \nbiography that is partly etched on the surface of the knife as a \u2018patina\u2019 of \nageing (McCracken 1990: 31-43); the blade is worn and has nicks in it and the \nhandle was, accidentally, prematurely aged in a dishwasher. \nThe social status of the object arises neither simply from its technical \nproperties, nor from those ascribed to it through the selling process. It arises \nthrough the way that humans interact with it, in the context of a system of \nobjects. It is held in a particular way and fits the hand in a certain way, \nworking as a tool, extending the properties of body within what George Mead \nwould call the \u2018manipulative area\u2019 (Mead 1980: 119-139; McCarthy 1984). As \nan object it enables its user to do certain things and it will be selected for use \nfrom amongst other objects with a similar function on the grounds of its \nproperties. As an extension of its user it is not part of direct interaction with \nother human beings - it has never been used to threaten another human \nbeing with violence - but it does enable interaction with other objects, \nparticularly food. Occasionally it gets used to open a stubborn plastic wrapped \nparcel or for some other domestic use. \nThe knife also mediates between its user and the other humans who enjoy the \nfood cut up with it. Perhaps more importantly this particular object works as a \npersonal symbolic object that mediates my past to me carrying meanings that \n 16 \nare inscribed but invisible, like a memento or a photograph (Csikszentmihalyi \nand Rochberg-Halton 1981; Riggins 1994). I notice that I am more likely than \nother members of the household to use this knife are. Though not as \nattractive as more recently acquired knives, for me it feels right; as people say \nof clothes that they like to wear and be seen in, it is \u2018comfortable\u2019. \nBaudrillard off the hook \nI have argued that Baudrillard both links consumption to the cash nexus and \nthat he provides the source of some themes that I think a sociology of material \nculture should pursue. However, by the time that the English language writers \non consumption to whom I\u2019ve referred had begun to get caught up in the cash \nnexus, Baudrillard had of course moved on. Symbolic Exchange and Death \n(1993 [1976]) marks a turning point in his work in which the issues of \nconsumption have become disconnected from the cash nexus and \nreconnected to the symbolic economies of sex, death and the simulacrum. \nNot only is production dead but also, in effect, so is consumption. Why might \nBaudrillard be able to let go of the cash nexus so easily twenty-two years ago \nwhen it has become an increasingly hot topic for English social science? I \nwant to suggest that there are two reasons for this.  \nFirstly, because the connotations of the word \u2018consumption\u2019 are not quite the \nsame in French as in English, and secondly, because Baudrillard\u2019s account of \nThe Consumer Society was a critique of a social form, a stage in the \ndevelopment of capitalism, rather than an account of social practices. In \nFrench the verb consommer refers to using, consuming and eating but it also \nhas the positive meanings of accomplishing (as of a task), perpetrating (as of \na crime) and consummating (as of a marriage). In English the verb consume \n 17 \nand the noun form consumption, refer to eating and drinking, being engrossed \nas well as the negative meanings of using up, expending, destroying or \nburning up. The standard economic meaning refers to \u2018expenditure on goods \nand services for final use\u2019 and the noun form also carries the meaning of the \nwasting away of the body and was a term for tuberculosis (deriving from the \nLatin word consumptio - wasting away). In English the positive meanings to \ndo with the idea of accomplishment are dealt with by the different word \nconsummate.  \nThe negative meanings of the English word consume are not associated with \nthe French word consommer because there is a separate word in French, \nconsumer which means to wear away, or be eaten up, to destroy, including by \nfire and, in its reflexive form, se consumer, to waste away. There is also a \nFrench noun consomption which has the medical meaning of wasting away, of \ndecline. When Baudrillard uses the term consommation he clearly means the \nsame thing as the writers he refers to - Veblen, Galbraith and others - mean \nby the word consumption. But there are negative and final connotations in the \nEnglish use of the word that are dealt with by other words in French. In \nEnglish this leaves a moral connotation of consumption as wasteful, as a \nusing up, that Veblen connects to pecuniary strength - which is what counts in \nthe cash nexus. In French there is a more sanguine connotation of \nconsommation to do with accomplishment, perhaps even a marriage between \nperson and object.  \nSecondly, the issue of consumption for Baudrillard is not the consumption of \nclasses of objects or services but the consumption of the code, the system of \nvalues and meanings that goes with monetary exchange for goods in the cash \n 18 \nnexus. In The Consumer Society (1998 [1970]), rather, like Marcuse (1972 \n[1964]) a few years earlier, Baudrillard mounts a critique of that form of \nsociety in which consumption has become the response to affluence, \nobscuring the cultural hegemony of capitalism that lies behind the mask of \nindividual freedom and choice. To do this he takes on American academia\u2019s \nswallowing of the economistic account of consumption (Galbraith 1967; \nRiesman 1950; Packard 1960; Boorstein 1963). Baudrillard\u2019s critique unpacks \nthe social consequences of the consumption side of the cash nexus, which is \nso central to the market management of Galbraith\u2019s affluent society. So, his \ncritique of advertising is not to focus attention on commodities but to show \nhow it operates as an extension of the mass media as a means of socialising \npeople and distributing knowledge. His comments on \u2018personalisation\u2019 are not \nto emphasise the choice of the individual but to show that both individuals and \nthe choices they make are a construct of a particular social form. His critique \nof consumer society grows out of his awareness that the system of objects is, \nultimately, ideological and cannot be disconnected from the political \ndimensions of culture in general (Baudrillard 1996: 153). \nBaudrillard\u2019s critique points to the central contradiction in consumer society \nbetween the desire for consumption and the ethic that rejects wastefulness \nand excess. It is this dialectic that drives modern culture; the rationality that \ngives us the technical capacity to produce goods and services that satisfy our \nevery need is the same rationality that when applied to consumption is \nrepulsed by waste and excess, indulgence and greed. Baudrillard\u2019s critique of \nconsumer society is not intended to build on his earlier attempt to analyse the \nsystem of objects, but to explicate the culture that comes with the shift to \n 19 \nconsumption in affluent society. It is precisely around the cash nexus that \nculture is dragged down to what he calls, almost echoing Marcuse\u2019s argument \nabout the repressive desublimation effect of one-dimensional culture (1964: \n57-77), the \u2018lowest common culture\u2019 (Baudrillard 1998: 104). \nConclusions \nFor Westergaard the cash nexus was brittle; if it broke then the allegiance of \nworkers to the system would disappear. But politics is always more complex \nthan the single strand of the cash nexus, even when the workers are \nprivatised, affluent and instrumental. Such workers became the consumers of \nthe consumer society, enjoying the purchase of a range of objects and \nservices that improved the quality of their lives; cars, washing machines, \ntelevisions, furniture, clothes, holidays, insurance and leisure.  \nThe cash nexus did break for those who lost their jobs, often whole \ncommunities and industries, but for those of us who continue to have incomes \nit enables us to partake in the life of society. This does not mean that \nconsumption is an end in itself for the vast majority of people. The cash nexus \nof consumption is just the beginning of a 'quasi-social' relationship with what \nwas bought. These relations with objects are a key part of what binds us to \nthe social order and such relationships occur whether or not cash was \nexchanged. The objects of material culture may be acquired by inheritance, \nthrough sharing, as a gift, by finding, by misappropriation as well as by \nbuying. In late capitalism they are more likely to follow from the handing over \nof money but it is not the handing over of cash or the inducements to do so \nthat determines the way objects are lived with or used.  \n 20 \nSo how should material culture be approached by sociology? I have been \narguing that rather than understand the relationship with material objects as \nderived from the process of purchase, it should be seen as more akin to the \nrelationships between people. The reason for arguing for this 'quasi-social' \nrelationship is for two reasons, both of enormous sociological importance. The \nfirst is that objects become vehicles of meaning. This is not just in a simple \nsense of the object having a symbolic meaning which is available to be \ndecoded (handbag = mature woman) but allows for layers of both cultural and \npersonal meaning to be embedded in the object. For example the materials \nand the techniques of manufacture of a handbag will indicate much about the \ntechnological state of the culture that produces it. The design (size, shape, \ncolour, fixings, handles) will orient the object to the cultural code of fashion \nwhich in turn relates in a non-determinative way to individual identity (Simmel \n1971). These meanings are not fixed because the material culture in which \nthe object exists change around it long after it is bought; a handbag style may \ncome back into fashion, the development of new production techniques may \ndistinguish the handbag as of a different era. Perhaps most importantly, the \nobject ages and often it ages with its possessor so that the meanings of \nparticular life experiences become linked to the object. Peoples' quasi-social \nrelationships with objects then attach them to their culture and their social life, \nlinking past and present, mediating direct human relationships and indirect \ncultural ones.  \nThe second reason for thinking of the relationship with objects as 'quasi-\nsocial' is that human beings interact with the object. The use of the object - \ntouching, looking, placing, carrying, incorporating it into activities, cleaning \n 21 \nand maintaining it - integrates the object into social lives. Objects (such as the \nknife in my story, or a woman's handbag) enable people to do what they do in \nthe particular social context in which they live. It is possible to imagine \nhumans living, as most other animals do, without the aid of objects that they \nhave made, but human societies are distinguished by the particular sets of \nobjects that are used to carry on life. It is this fact that is the cornerstone of \narchaeology and central to anthropology but strangely absent from sociology. \nThese two reasons are of course interconnected; it is through interaction with \nobjects that their meanings become disembedded and given a context. While \nobjects are functional (cutting up food, carrying personal possessions) they \nare at the same time situating the people who use them in social and \nhistorical contexts. I have been arguing that the focus on consumption in \ncontemporary English writing has tended to divert attention away from the \nmore routine relationships with objects. Some American writing has in \ncontrast drawn on phenomenology, symbolic interactionism and ethnography \nto link the meanings of objects to the uses they have and the way they are \nlived with (e.g. Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981; Riggins 1994a).  \nThere are of course traces of this approach in the consumption literature. Lury \ndiscusses the connection between things and social lives (1996: 10-26), \nSlater has a chapter on the 'uses of things' (1997: 148-173) and Miller offers \nthe tantalising idea of 'sublation' as a sort of de-alienation relationship with \nobjects that occurs as we use and live with them: \nThe authenticity of artifacts as culture derives . . . from their active \nparticipation in a process of social self-creation in which they are \ndirectly constitutive of our understanding of ourselves and others. The \n 22 \nkey criteria for judging the utility of contemporary objects is the degree \nto which they may or may not be appropriated from the forces which \ncreated them, which are mainly of necessity, alienating. \n(Miller 1987: 215) \nHowever, it is studies of consumption and the seemingly dominating feature of \nthe cash nexus that attract research interest rather than the more mundane, \nthough difficult to study, topic of 'objects in use'. There are difficulties with \nstudying the 'taken-for-granted' rather than the socially hot topic of 'what-to-\nbuy?' People do not think about their relationships with objects much, \nespecially when those objects are doing what is required of them. Research \ntechniques that observe things in use and find ways of asking people about \nhow they live with them, are necessary for a sociology of things11. Such \ntechniques are emerging in the context of studies of work (e.g. Heath and \nHindmarsh, forthcoming), the sociology of technology and the ethnography of \ncontemporary, everyday life12.  \nAs with the impact of affluence on the world of work, the impact of affluence \non the social world of material culture should not be seen as determined by \nthe cash nexus. I have argued that material culture should be recognised as \ncomplex and interesting in itself and suggested that Baudrillard's idea of a \nsystem of objects would provide a firmer foundation for an empirical 'sociology \nof things' than the cash nexus. In place of the current focus on consumption, \nstudies of the 'quasi-social' relationships of meaning and interaction between \nhumans and objects are needed. The relationships between people, cultures \nand the things they live with and use have existed as long as societies have; \nthey extend much further than the relations of consumption .   \n 23 \n                                            \n1 Runciman 1966; MacKenzie and Silver 1968; Goldthorpe et al. 1968. \n2 Although in the Manifesto of the Communist Party Marx and Engels do not make reference \nto Carlyle, elsewhere when they write about cash payments as constituting a social nexus \nthey do. For example, this is how Engels describes the bourgeois attitude to the working \nclass: \u201cIt lies quite outside the comprehension of the middle classes that there should be any \nrelationship between masters and men other than the purely economic link. The bourgeoisie \nsee in the workers only \u2018hands\u2019 and calls them \u2018hands\u2019 to their faces. As Carlyle says, the \nmiddle classes can conceive of no relationship between human beings than the cash nexus.\u201d \n(Engels 1958 [1845]: 312).  \nCarlyle introduced the phrase in the context of discussing the changing social order from one \nin which the aristocracy governed the lower classes: \u201cFor, in one word, Cash Payment had \nnot then grown to be the universal sole nexus of man to man; it was something other than \nmoney that the high then expected from the low, and could not live without getting from the \nlow. Not as buyer and seller alone, of land or what else it might be, but in many senses still as \nsoldier and captain, as clansman and head, as loyal subject and guiding king, was the low \nrelated to the high. With the supreme triumph of Cash, a changed time has entered; there \nmust a changed Aristocracy enter.\u201d (Carlyle 1971 [1839]: 213-4). Carlyle, Marx and Engels \nand Westergaard use the phrase the 'cash nexus' to point to the way the simple economic \nrelation of cash displaces and replaces the complex and enduring social relations of other \nsocial formations. \n3 See for example Runciman 1966: 208-218. \n4 Although of course his For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign was published in \nEnglish translation 1981 and a large chunk of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Consommation was published in \nSelected Writings in 1988 and another large chunk in Revenge of the Crystal in 1990. I guess \na number of commentators were reading and using Baudrillard\u2019s ideas directly from the \nFrench (perhaps most importantly Marshall Sahlins in Culture and Practical Reason in 1979) \nalthough the reading of work in foreign languages is more typical of the American and \nEuropean academic than of the English.  \n 24 \n                                            \n5 Peter Saunders has even argued that there is something intrinsically human in the desire to \nbuy one's own home (1990). He uses both sociobiological arguments about desire for \npossession and an account of the development of a particularly English material culture to \nexplain the dominant choice for home possession as 'ownership'.  \n6 I have developed these themes are more length elsewhere; Dant 1999. \n7 As Barthes points out, the use of the first person in such writing should be understood as \nimaginary, in the psychoanalytic sense of the term: \u201cWriting is precisely that space in which \nthe persons of grammar and the origins of discourse mingle, combine, and lose each other \nuntil they are unidentifiable: writing is the truth not of the person (of the author), but of \nlanguage.\u201d (Barthes 1988 [1974]: 8) \n8 I can, with hindsight, admit that my rhetoric was somewhat motivated by the disturbance of \nthe beer-drinking, blues-listening household I\u2019d shared with her lover before she moved in. \n9 There was no brand name on the handle or any label or packaging with the knife. However, \nin the 1980s I realised that the blade itself carries the brand name \u2018Sabatier\u2019 - by then such \nthings had become important - even though it did not look like the Sabatier knives being \nmarketed at that time. \n10 The word \u2018model\u2019 has almost contradictory meanings; both as a representation, usually \nsmaller, derived from a series and as the pattern or standard to be imitated by the series. \nBaudrillard\u2019s account seems to exploit this ambiguity, in which the singularity of the model is \ncultural rather than material. The model can of course refer to a series of objects that are \nsimilar in form and function - like a model of car - while personalisation can \u2018modelise\u2019 one of \nthe series through colour, optional extras and other distinguishing features  (Baudrillard 1996: \n137-155). \n11In arguing against an array of cultural critics and commentators on consumption, the authors \nof The Story of the Sony Walkman stress \". . . the importance of exploring the different uses \nmade of the Walkman in the practices of their everyday lives by different sorts of people in \n 25 \n                                            \ndifferent contexts\" (du Gay et al. 1997:94). But all they can draw on are Sony's own marketing \nstudies which they have been lucky enough to get some access to. \n12 e.g. Miller's own study of kitchens (Miller 1988), Corrigan's (1994) of clothes as lived with \nobjects and Riggins's (1994a) of his parents' living room'. Other examples include \ncontributions by Chevalier, Pellegram, and Jarman in Miller 1998b, and contributions by \nDanet and Katriel, Shields, Callum-Swan and Manning, in Riggins 1994b.
