Regularly, this \njournal has been welcoming scholars from neighbouring fields to get involved in \nextending the perspectives of accounting research towards a wider and comparative \nunderstanding of how various forms of calculative practices affect, and interrelate \nwith, the social settings in which they operate. One interesting new field of study \nwhich has taken shape outside accounting research is the field of social studies of \nfinance (henceforth SSF). This field, now emerging at intersections of economic \nsociology, science and technology studies, cultural anthropology, and cultural \ngeography, has much to offer to researchers interested in the practices, agencies, \nprogrammes and technologies of calculation. This introductory essay to the special \nAOS section will provide a preliminary tour of SSF, explore its intersections with \naccounting research and test some common ground on which research interests \nshared across SSF and accounting might be brought to co-operate. \nWhat unifies social studies of finance and those of accounting as \"social and \ninstitutional practice\" (Hopwood & Miller, 1994) is their engagement with social \nsettings characterised by a high frequency of circulating numbers. A remarkable \nnumber of researchers has by now become involved in investigating how the use of \nnumbers and a range of different social settings co-develop, change or persist. Yet, \nSSF and sociologically oriented accounting research have developed as distinct fields \nwith relatively little interchange. Probably the most palpable difference between SSF \nand interdisciplinary research in accounting is that the latter has largely focussed on \naspects of calculative practices subject to formal organization. Accounting studies \nhave been extending traditional preoccupations with business enterprises towards \nthe employment of numbers in programmes and technologies of government (Miller \n& Rose, 1990), and the respective roles of accounting professionals (for an overview \nsee e.g. Cooper & Robson, 2006) across the sectors and topologies of a \"shifting \nsphere of the economic\" (Hopwood 1992), moved, moulded and put in place by \nembedding calculative practices in different kinds of organizations. SSF have, on the \nother hand, mainly been exploring the construction of markets and market cultures \n(Abolafia, 1996, 1998; Knorr Cetina & Br\u00fcgger, 2002) and the roles of calculative \nmodels and technologies (\u201cmarket devices\u201d) in the framing of social and socio-\ntechnical interaction in market settings (Callon, Millo & Muniesa, 2007a; Callon, \n1998a; MacKenzie & Millo, 2003; Muniesa, 2003; Preda, 2006). \nOn an institutional level, accounting research has, even in its most socially theorized \nforms, been developing mainly within the boundaries of the accounting discipline \nand its academic establishments. Researchers involved in SSF appear to be mostly \nassociated with sociology and anthropology units of universities. One might \nhypothesize that such differences in institutional environments, in line with \ncontrasting professional affiliations, may have been constituting major reasons why \ncorrespondence across SSF and interdisciplinary accounting research has remained \nquite limited. The review elements of this introductory essay would like to indicate \nwhy this presents an unfortunate and at least unnecessary state of comparative \nneglect. Without claiming to be comprehensive either in reviewing or in diagnosing \nsymptomatic shortcomings of an unevenly distributed academic attention, we would \n 3 \nabove all like to demonstrate the potential of a shared field of research concerned \nwith the circulation of financial numbers across the diverse settings of social life, and \nwe would like to suggest that there is indeed strong potential in a common academic \ntrack which social studies of finance and accounting might collectively explore. \nFinding a particularly appropriate label for a field opening up for researchers from \ndifferent scientific disciplines is not easy. Speaking of interdisciplinary finance and \naccounting studies would perhaps appropriately mirror the self-designation of that \nparticular research tradition \u2013 science and technology studies - from which both SSF \nand social research in accounting have been gaining major theoretical inspirations. \nYet opening up interdisciplinarily might not only bring together unaccustomed \ncohabitants, it might also make it difficult to institutionalize an effective research \nagenda. In order to articulate itself as a specialized track of scientific discourse, a \nprospective field of accounting and finance studies might then perhaps need an \nimpulse similar to the one science and technology studies received from David \nBloor's formulation of the strong programme in the sociology of knowledge in the \n1970s (Bloor 1992 [originally 1976]). In closing this introductory essay, we would like \nto put the question to the readers of this special section what a strong programme of \nresearch in finance and accounting studies might look like, encouraging the \nelaboration of research agendas seeking to transcend boundaries in and between the \ntwo fields. \nFinancial cognition, calculative agency, performativity, and sets of \nparticipants: A brief tour of SSF \nPerhaps one of the best starting points for introducing SSF is the concept of \ninformation. Taking information as a starting point is justified by the centrality of \nthis notion not only to the practices of participants in financial markets, but also to \nthe theoretical apparatus of financial economics. Market participants are \ncharacterized by a constant search for relevant information, a search which shapes \ntheir decisions and is reflected in the dynamics of transactions and securities prices. \nFinancial economics sees prices as incorporating all the information available to \nmarket participants (e.g. Stigler, 1961), while the incorporation mechanisms are \npublicly available. Information appears as crucial not only with respect to how \nparticipants perceive, order, and justify their activities and decisions, but also with \nrespect to price behaviour. Consequently, SSF, which - broadly put - investigate the \nknowledge processes underlying financial transactions, assign this notion a \nprominent place in their research programmes. \nThe way in which SSF approach information, however, differs in some significant \nrespects from the presentation and discussion of this concept in financial economics, \nas well as in social structural varieties of economic sociology. In financial economics, \ninformation is understood as signals, akin to the electric impulses circulating through \nthe wires of a telephone switchboard. This specific notion fuses together a view of \nmarkets as distributors of information (and therefore of resources), formulated in the \n 4 \n1930s by Friedrich von Hayek (within the debates about the economic failures of \ncommunism), with a methodological approach developed in operations research \nduring WWII and oriented towards the detection of meaningful patterns underlying \napparently random signals (Mirowski, 2002, pp. 37, 60; Klein, 2001). In this \nperspective, signals are additive: they trigger a reaction in the receiver, while being \nindependent of the cognitive properties of the latter. An understanding of \ninformation as signals separates information from cognition, and makes possible a \ndistinction between meaningful signals and noise, with the latter being understood \nas a lack of determined patterns. \nSocial structural approaches in economic sociology operate with a notion of \ninformation very similar to the above. Information is understood as signals \ncirculating through networks of social relationships, with the latter, in their turn, \nacting both as information channels and as signals (e.g. Podolny, 2001, 2005; White, \n2002, pp. 100-101). Networks of social relationships circulate information, but, from \nthe perspective of a third party, they appear as information too, about the \n(non)existence of social ties, their duration, etc., information which is used in \nbusiness decisions. In this perspective, networks are analogous with electric circuits, \nand the absence or presence of ties is taken to indicate the limits and possibilities for \nthe distribution of signals. The distinction between cognition and information thus is \naffirmed, although it is acknowledged that, within networks, information is \nprocessed according to frames of interpretation shared by members. Frames of \ninterpretation, in their turn, can be provided by common assumptions, but also by \nwhat Harrison White (2000) calls discourses, understood as common activities, i.e., \ninstitutionalized occasions for conversations and contact maintenance. In a nutshell, \nframes of interpretation are provided by shared activities and occasions within a \nnetwork, activities and occasions which stabilize signals, making them accountable \nand transferable across situations. \nSuch shared occasions and activities hint at the fact that (financial) information might \nafter all not be entirely independent of the cognitive properties and practices of \npotential and actual receivers, and that recipients of information cannot be seen as \npassive with respect to how signals are processed. Neither can such aspects of \ncognition be seen as independent from, nor as unaffected by the interactions of \nmarket participants. What becomes necessary, then, is a specification of (a) the \ninteraction mechanisms which constitute information, and (b) how such interaction \nmechanisms underlie cognitive processes, understood not as neural operations, but \nas cooperative, practical achievements of participants. In the face of such \ncontingencies, an excessive emphasis put on networks of social relationships might \nnot only run the risk of suggesting a natural tendency of networks towards closure \nbut also that there will tend to be just as many frames of interpretation as there are \nnetworks, with dominant frames, once set in place, contributing to network closure. \nThis ends up leaving little room for explaining conflicting dynamics and change, \nboth across and within networks. \nSSF, in turn, tend to depart from an understanding of information as signals \ncirculating on a circuit board, and re-orient the investigative focus towards financial \n 5 \ncognition, understood as a practical, interaction-based achievement of market \nparticipants. The notion of \"financial cognition\" draws attention to processes of \ninteractive knowledge production and the roles that cognitive schemas \u2013 in \ncombination with technical instruments, financial models, specific room layouts, group \ninteractions etc. \u2013 play in the formation and execution of investment and trading \nstrategies (e.g. Beunza & Stark, 2005; De Bondt, 2005). Broadly speaking, two \ndirections within SSF might be distinguished: one of them is represented by close up, \nmicrosociological studies of financial cognition, and the other by performativity \nstudies exploring conditions and consequences of financial models and finance \ntheory at an aggregate level. \nField studies of cognitive practices re-focus the attention from information-as-signals \nto interaction-based cognitive processes, seen as determining what market \nparticipants will accept as information, how they will process and store it, and how \nthey will use it in their activities. Such cognitive processes include, among others, \nobservation, classification, calculation, and memorization, understood as practical, \naccountable activities taking place within and depending on webs of social \ninteractions (e.g. Lynch, 2006; Maynard, 2006). Drawing, inter alia, on \nethnomethodology and phenomenology, one of the methodological implications of \nthis approach is the direct, longitudinal, in situ observation of cognitive activities, as \nthey are performed by market participants in their everyday actions and in \ninteraction with other human participants, as well as with artefacts. This view, then, \nstresses the fact that (financial) cognition is a distributed, cooperative activity \n(Hutchins, 1995), irreducible to a fixed set of universal rules. \nThe shift from signals to cognitive practices also triggers a series of consequences for \nhow core market activities, such as trading, are subsequently conceived. For instance, \nnumerical data (such as price and volume) are acknowledged as crucial with respect \nto the trading process. While structural and institutional approaches in economic \nsociology (e.g. Carruthers & Stinchcombe, 2001; Smith 1989; Uzzi & Lancaster, 2004) \nsee numerical data as endowed with meaning and trust by the authoritative nature of \nthe channels through which they circulate, by formal rules, and by framing \nprocedures (e.g. attaching rationalizations and justifying narratives to numbers), \nfield studies of financial cognition see the reception, selection, and uses of such data \nas depending on practical cognitive activities such as observation, classification, and \ncalculation (see e.g. Kalthoff, 2005). \nThis becomes even more relevant in electronic, anonymous trading, where traders \nrely less on widespread social networks and direct exchanges with known partners, \nand where activities such as screen observation become crucial. These differences \nhave prompted some observers to argue that global electronic markets embody \nprinciples different from those of exchanges based on personal interactions. While \nthe latter can be conceived as networked systems, the former might more adequately \nbe regarded as scopic systems (e.g. Knorr Cetina & Bruegger, 2002; Knorr Cetina, \n2007; Knorr Cetina & Preda, 2007). In contexts such as that of online trading, \nnumerical data do not appear to carry self-evident properties (Zaloom, 2006), or to \nwork as signals which the trader decodes. Rather, what happens from the traders\u2019 \n 6 \nperspective is that highly unstable flickers on the screen are subjected to an \ninteraction-based observation process involving definitional, stabilizing, and \nintegrative procedures. Out of this process emerge numerical data endowed with \nrelevant properties, which are attached to rationalization devices (such as narratives) \nand used as a tool and a resource for further action. Thus, traders are not confronted \nfrom the start with numbers as meaningful signals which can be decoded at a glance. \nThe very situation of electronic trading, where multiple, unstable screen displays \nshift all the time, makes this impossible. Financial data appears as the outcome of a \nseries of practical, interaction-based cognitive activities, which include both human \nparticipants and technological systems. \nWhile highly technologized transaction environments highlight the role of cognitive \nactivities, they also shed light on the role played by formal models (such as those for \ncalculating theoretical prices for derivatives) in transactions. Formal models, which \nare easy to integrate into an electronic trading environment with high computing \ncapacities, are developed within financial economics. SSF have been addressing these \nformal models in asking whether they bear performative functions - that is if, instead \nof representing an external reality, such models directly intervene in the production \nof the reality they claim to represent (e.g. MacKenzie, Muniesa and Siu, 2007; but see \nalso Hacking, 1983). Suspicions of performativity have been amplified by the ever \ngrowing role played by intermediary groups, such as financial experts and analysts, \nin contemporary global markets. However, tracing performativity effects beyond the \nuse of formal models, other expert and status-group specific forms of analyses might \ntake over not so much representational as performative functions in being adopted \nby market participants as tools of intervention in transactions. \nThe concept of performativity, introduced to SSF by Michel Callon (1998a) and \nsubsequently specified by Donald MacKenzie (2006; MacKenzie & Millo, 2003; \nDidier, 2007) addresses the blurred distinction between representational and \ninterventionist uses of economic models by financial practitioners. It highlights the \nrole of group interests and\/or conflicts in the implementation of formal models, as \nwell as the capacity of the latter to transform transaction forms, rules, and objects. \nWhile Donald MacKenzie stresses that performativity can also have negative effects \n(e.g. when use of models is imitated, to the effect of unravelling transactions), Michel \nCallon focuses more on the basic assumptions underlying the use of formal models. \nInitially, Callon wanted to distance himself from the sociological debates about the \n(in)existence of the homo oeconomicus by arguing that the latter should be \nunderstood as a set of behavioural scripts enacted in practice. Such scripts require \nsets of artefacts, including formal models. Therefore, in a further step of the \nargument, the question was raised whether such artefacts - essential in changing \ntransaction rules - are endowed with agential features, called calculative agency \n(Callon, 2004, p. 123; Barry & Slater, 2002). \nCalculative agency is characterized by (a) framing, (b) disentanglement, and (c) \nperformativity. Framing represents the distinctions used by participants in order to \nestablish what is calculable and what is not. Disentanglement means drawing \nboundaries between relevant and irrelevant elements with respect to calculability, \n 7 \nwhile performativity indicates the use of technologies (including abstract models) in \nmarket transactions. Therefore, framing and disentanglement appear as prerequisites \nfor performativity; the question, however, is what exactly is meant by calculability. \nObviously, this latter must mean something else than applying sets of mathematical \nrules to the processing of numerical data. Michel Callon and his collaborator Fabian \nMuniesa (2005, pp. 1229, 1231; Muniesa & Callon, 2007; but see also Callon, Millo & \nMuniesa, 2007a) see calculability as intrinsic to the character of markets not only as \nallocation mechanisms, but mainly as collective devices for assigning value. They \nfollow here an argument coming from the French school of conventions (e.g. \nBoltanski & Th\u00e9venot, 2007), according to which societies set in place various \nvaluation mechanisms, market exchanges being just one of them. Calculability \ntherefore designates the (collaborative) processes which make possible the \nassignment of numbers (such as prices) to entities (be they financial securities or \nconsumable goods), an assignment which, in its turn, endows these entities with \nrelative stability and makes possible their circulation throughout society. \nIn this perspective, calculability would include commensurability and \nstandardization, features which stress that classification is a cognitive operation. One \nof the questions almost automatically raised here is that of the various groups of \nparticipants involved in making entities commensurable and in standardizing them. \nFinancial experts are such a group and, indeed, we encounter the argument \naccording to which financial analysts, for instance, perform precisely the function of \nmaking securities commensurable (Beunza & Garud, 2007) and of classifying them \nwithin certain categories (e.g. Zuckerman, 1999, 2004). If we move away from a \nfunctionalist approach to the activities of such groups, however, we can see that, at \nleast in some situations, formal models are used to justify decisions which serve \nspecific interests. Based on their analysis of the airwave spectrum auctions, Philip \nMirowski and Edward Nik-Kah (2007) warn that performativity should not be \nunderstood as attributing to economists socio-political powers they do not actually \npossess. The material interests of entrenched economic groups play a considerable \nrole in the shaping of markets (perhaps even more so in the case of one-off events \nlike an airwave auction), with formal models serving (at least sometimes) a \nlegitimating function. \nThe debates around the performativity of economic models and interest groups (see \nalso Yonay & Breslau, 2006) raise the issue of the link between calculation (and \nnumerical data), on the one hand, and group differences, stratification and \ninequality, on the other hand (cf. Preda, 2006). This debate is relevant with respect to \nmicrosociological field studies of financial cognition too: for instance, the assumption \nof cognitive distinctions between institutional and non-institutional traders, so often \nencountered in financial modelling, would require a field-based comparison between \nthe two: do non-institutional traders indeed use numbers in a different way from \ninstitutional ones? Do they utilize different calculative practices or technologies? \nWhile some financial models (e.g. Shleifer, 2000, pp. 13, 33) work with the \nassumption of a distinction between informed and less informed, rational and less \nrational investors and traders, corresponding to one between institutional and non-\n 8 \ninstitutional market participants, SSF do not take such a distinction as given or \nnatural. Since technological systems have widened access to online trading and to \nfinancial information, it cannot be assumed that institutional investors and traders \n(who have more financial resources) automatically have access to better information \nor that they behave rationally, while non-institutional participants do not. From the \nSSF perspective, the main question is to see how such differences are constituted in \npractical actions (if at all) by specific participants, and to what effects. The approach \nis to regard these differences not only as discursive devices, legitimating the \npositions of specific participants and groups, but also to see whether and how they \nare created in the practical actions of trading, for instance (e.g. Smith 2006; Zaloom, \n2006). If distinctions are generated in action, then the next step would be to \ninvestigate their cognitive role with respect to the production of information. For \ninstance, are distinctions between informed\/uninformed traders produced within \nthe process of trading and, if yes, are they co-constitutive of this process? Do they \ninfluence the observation, memorization, and calculation processes through which \ntraders generate information? \nA programme of field research focussing on cognitive practices does not mean \nignoring issues like emotions in trading activities. Recent developments in the \nsociology of emotions have opened the way for treating these not as opposed to, but \nwithin a cognitive framework (e.g., Berezin, 2005; Collins, 2004). From the \nperspective of SSF, this increases the appeal of an interaction- and cognition-oriented \ntheoretical frame as a replacement for old dichotomies (cf. Abolafia, 1998, pp. 72-76). \nBut this and the abovementioned themes are still awaiting sustained research. \nDifferences among social groups with respect to investment holdings have long been \nnoticed (e.g., Swedberg, 2005; Keister, 2000), and differences in financial power \nbetween institutional and non-institutional investors\/ traders are obvious. Yet, we \nstill lack a thorough comparison of these participants, one which should focus on \npractical trading actions. Methodologically, SSF seem well equipped to tackle such \nissues \u2013 the field is host to microanalytical studies (e.g. Muniesa, 2003; L\u00e9pinay, 2007; \nKnorr Cetina & Bruegger, 2002), anchored primarily in participant observation, \ndiscourse and conversation analysis, as well as more macroanalytical ones studying \nfinance and financial markets at a more aggregate level (studies of performativity, \ne.g., have a decidedly macroanalytical orientation, see MacKenzie, 2006; Muniesa & \nCallon, 2007; MacKenzie, Beunza & Hardie, 2006; MacKenzie & Hardie, 2007), \nhistorical (e.g., Preda, 2006) as well as contemporary research. The methodological \nvariety is accompanied by the attention paid to empirical studies (the case study \noccupying here a prominent role) as a source of theoretical innovation (Stake, 2000). \nYet comparative issues like differences between groups and types of participants do, \nso far, not appear to have profited much from this variety. \nA second empirical issue, connected to the above, is that of the relationships among \nvarious kinds of financial expertise and expert groups. Expert academic knowledge \n(as embodied in formal models of price behaviour, for instance) is not the only kind \nof expertise available to market participants. Alongside it, various types of expertise \nco-exist, in relationships which, while not always easy, have proven durable. An \n 9 \nexample in this respect is provided by forms of \u201ctechnical analysis\u201d or \"chartism\", a \nbody of expert knowledge which, contested by academic economics since at least the \n1930s, has become institutionalized and is widely used by market participants. \nMoreover, from a perspective looking at trading as practical action, the distinctions \nbetween expert and lay knowledge do not appear as clear cut anymore: (financial) \nexpertise itself requires practical knowledge and is moored in the day-to-day \nroutines of its practitioners. As studies of scientific expertise show (e.g., Collins & \nEvans, 2002; Lynch, Cole, McNally & Jordan, 2008), expert and lay knowledge cannot \nbe taken as completely separated from each other. The use of (formal) pricing models \nin trading actions intertwines with the practical knowledge of market practitioners, \nwho may ignore or use them in ways which are not prescribed by experts. To give an \nexample, non-institutional online traders, while having pricing models embedded in \ntheir trading software, choose not to use them. The questions then become: How do \nusers of pricing models matter (e.g. Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2003)? How are models put \nto practical uses in the process of trading and to what effects? \nSocial structural approaches to (financial) markets have emphasized their network \ncharacter, as well as the role of group hierarchies (e.g., Podolny, 2005); neo-\ninstitutionalist approaches have primarily stressed (formal) rules, routines, and \npolitics in the constitution of markets (e.g. Fligstein, 1996; Carruthers, 1996; Dobbin, \n1994). Until now, SSF have been rather cautious in formulating a general definition of \n(financial) markets, as well as in adopting a reifying emphasis on \u201cculture.\u201d This \ndoes not mean, however, a lack of theoretical perspective. While studies of the \ninteraction order of market transactions have emphasized social control through \ntemporal coordination, studies of performativity have seen markets as \n\u201csociotechnical agencements\u201d (Callon, 2007, pp. 323-326) - that is, as a nexus of \nhuman participants and technologies which, while generating a specific body of \nknowledge, generates behavioural scripts as well. This non-functionalist view \nhighlights the fact that markets consist of patterns of knowledge and behaviour \nwhich go beyond allocation mechanisms. All in all, one could venture that, \ntheoretically, SSF see markets as knowledge-based, hybrid arrangements (i.e., \nincluding human participants and artefacts) of social control. \nTo finish this brief tour with a projection of future research directions inherent in \nSSF, these will have to include the continuation of the investigation of financial \nmarkets, as well as the branching out into the analysis of domains subjected to what \nis called \u201cmarketization\u201d (e.g., health care, carbon markets). Since technological \ninnovation in financial markets occurs at rapid pace, SSF is confronted with a very \ndynamic domain of investigation. The increased participation of non-institutional \ntraders in financial transactions, the advance of anonymous electronic trading and \nthe increasing integration of trading platforms at trans-continental level pose many \nchallenges to the field investigation of, amongst other things, screen-related cognitive \nactivities (with calculation occupying a prominent role) and their embedding in \ninstitutional and non-institutional contexts. The incorporation of heterogeneous \nentities into the area of financial transactions (e.g., housing) and the transformations \nthat such entities subsequently underwent (necessary in order to make them \ntradeable) provide an additional object of investigation for SSF, one in which \n 10 \ncalculability also plays a prominent role. At the same time, the expansion of \nprinciples such as cost-effectiveness, profit-making, and the application of market \nmechanisms as regulatory instruments into domains of activity, such as health care \nor environmental protection (which have been such prominent issues in accounting \nresearch), perpetuates questions about the performativity of economic, finance and \naccounting models. Consequently, SSF will be drawn to expanding inquiries beyond \nthe boundaries of financial markets into other aspects of the \"shifting sphere of the \neconomic\" (Hopwood, 1992) \u2013 to meet with accounting? \nAccounting intersections \nSocial and institutional studies of accounting share many commonalities with SSF. \nBoth fields are interested in similar research objects: models, instruments and \npractices of calculation. To a certain extent, they also share similar research \nquestions. Both, for example, are concerned with the study of the ways in which \ncalculative practices shape, and are shaped by, the social, organizational and \ninstitutional settings in which they operate. Both draw attention to the complex \ninterrelations that exist between technologies of calculation, organizational \nstructures, social and socio-technical interactions, cultures and institutions. Further, \nboth research strands place particular emphasis on the constituting, rather than \nmirroring, roles of numbers and calculative devices. Both assume that calculative \npractices actively create, rather than merely reflect, economic realities. Both regard \nthe functionality of calculative systems, agencies and regimes as something which \nneeds to be explained rather than assumed. \nIn addition, social and institutional studies of finance and accounting have common, \nintersecting theoretical reference points. In both fields, researchers for instance make \nuse of, and contribute to the further development of, concepts and approaches that, \ninitially, had been developed in the contexts of science and technology studies (e.g. \nCallon, 1986; Latour, 1987; Law, 1986; Hacking, 1983; Knorr Cetina, 1999; MacKenzie \n1990; Porter, 1995). Both social studies of accounting and SSF, amongst other things, \nare interested in untangling the relationships between science and practices of \neconomic calculation.  \nIn the field of accounting research, Miller and O\u2019Leary, for instance, analyzed the \nfactory Caterpillar as a \"laboratory\" (Miller & O'Leary, 1996) and, in a recently \npublished article, studied investment appraisals at Intel with reference to Wise\u2019s \n(1988) concept of \"mediating machines\" (Miller & O'Leary, 2007). Robson (1992; 1994) \nlooked at accounting numbers as \"inscriptions\" and utilized Latour\u2019s (1987) notion of \n\"action at a distance\" in his study of the rise of inflation accounting in the UK. Power \n(1995) wrote about \"Auditing, Expertise and the Sociology of Technique\" and edited \na book exploring the relations between calculation, accounting and science (Power, \n1994a). Chua (1995) made reference to actor-network theory in her study of the \nfabrication of accounting images in three public hospitals. Dechow and Mouritsen \n(2005) drew on actor-network theory in their study of the workings of Enterprise \n 11 \nResource Planning systems. And Young (2006) used Hacking (1986) for her study of \nthe construction of financial statement users in US-American accounting standard \nsetting. \nSSF have even closer connections to the field of science and technology studies, as \nmany of the current SSF scholars started out as science and technology students (e.g. \nMichel Callon, Karin Knorr, Donald MacKenzie, Fabian Muniesa, Alex Preda). SSF \nscholars seek to establish the 'science and technology framework' as an alternative to \nthe more conventional, social structural approaches to the study of markets in \neconomic sociology. They focus on the \"machineries of knowing\" (Knorr Cetina, \n1999, p. 5, cited in MacKenzie, 2006, p. 12), the epistemic cultures, models, \ninstruments and socio-technical interactions that shape and make up financial \nmarkets. As was illustrated above, this focus helps SSF researchers to unpack notions \ncommon to both economics and more traditional approaches in economic sociology \n(like financial information, economic agencies, representations, markets etc.). \nAmongst other things, SSF have utilized the notion of market device (dispositif) to \nstudy \"the material and discursive assemblages that intervene in the construction of \nmarkets\" (Muniesa, Millo & Callon, 2007b: 2). Likewise, one finds many references to \nFoucault-inspired concepts of assemblage, constellation and dispositif in social \nstudies of accounting (e.g. Burchell, Clubb & Hopwood, 1985; Miller, 2008; Miller & \nO\u2019Leary, 1996). In accounting, notions of assemblage and constellation have, for \nexample, been used to draw attention to the fact that accounting and other \ncalculative practices and instruments are deeply entwined in issues and events that \nare of wider social, economic and political concern. The concepts of assemblage and \nconstellation are used to unpack the dynamic and constitutive role of accounting \npractices and instruments (Miller, 2008: 57). Similar to SSF, also accounting scholars \nhave emphasised the need to study calculative practices \"as a relatively discrete, yet \ntemporarily stabilised assemblage of devices for intervening with multiple \nconditions of emergence\" (Miller, 2008: 53). \nFinally, SSF and accounting share similar methodological frameworks. Both fields \nemploy a range of different, but mainly qualitative, methods of investigation, such as \ndiscourse analysis, participant observation, document analysis, conversation analysis \nand qualitative interviewing. The case study approach occupies not only a central \nrole in SSF, but also in social and institutional studies of accounting. \nYet, there also exist important differences between SSF and accounting research, e.g. \nwith respect to institutional location, disciplinary divisions of academic labour, the \nrespective empirical fields of investigation and theoretical orientations, each of which \nhave shaped the fields in different ways, thereby reducing possibilities for exchange \nand interaction amongst the two groups. SSF have focussed mainly on the study of \nfinancial markets, the roles of economics and finance theory in constructing those \nmarkets, the relevance of networks of social and socio-technical interaction in them, \ntheir cognitive and cultural underpinnings and the effects of financial markets on the \nworkings of corporations (see e.g. Abolafia, 1996; Knorr Cetina and Preda, 2005; \nMacKenzie, 2006; MacKenzie and Millo, 2003; MacKenzie, Muniesa & Siu, 2007). Yet, \n 12 \nas Miller (2008) has pointed out, SSF have studied calculative practices without much \nreference to broader programmes and ideas of social order, modalities of power and their effects \non the self and notions of \u201cactorhood\u201d (Meyer & Jepperson, 2000). Further, questions \nconcerning the relevance of calculative devices for processes and forms of \norganization have somewhat been neglected. In contrast, social and institutional \nstudies of accounting have been mainly concerned with the investigation of organized \ncalculative practice: histories, practices, social and organizational effects of \nbookkeeping, cost accounting, inflation accounting, performance measurement, \nauditing, corporate financial reporting, budgeting, investment appraisals, etc., and \ntheir intertwining with different modes of governing at the level of the economy, \norganizations and the conduct of persons. But, hitherto, accounting researcher have \nbeen awarding little attention to the roles of calculative practices in the construction \nof markets. Researchers have largely been focussing on the contribution of \naccounting ideas and techniques to the inner workings of private and public sector \norganizations (e.g. Ahrens, 1997; Covaleski & Dirsmith, 1988; Preston, Cooper & \nCoombs, 1992), processes of macroeconomic management and change (e.g. Neu & \nGraham, 2006; Suzuki, 2003), and dynamics of accounting professionalization (e.g. \nAnderson-Gough, Grey & Robson, 1998; Boland, 1982; Caramanis, 2002; Cooper & \nRobson, 2006).  \nFurther, it should be noted that social studies of accounting do not represent a \ncoherent, clearly identifiable strand of research. They have been built on a \nmultiplicity of different, at times conflicting theories and approaches. Besides science \nand technology studies, approaches rooted in sociological New Institutionalism, \nFoucauldian studies of governmentality, critical theory, political economy \napproaches, ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism have been used as \ntheoretical reference points (cf. Mennicken, 2005). Many studies have been concerned \nwith investigating the implication of accounting in processes of organizational \ncontrol, government and regulation (for an overview see Miller, 2008). Questions \nhave been addressed, such as: How does accounting get implicated in the creation of \nparticular organizational and economic conceptions? How does accounting achieve \nand maintain the position of organizational significance? How is it involved in \nprocesses of economic, social and organizational change? How is it implicated in the \n\u201cgovernmentalisation\u201d (Foucault, 1991), disciplining, liberalisation and calculation, \nof society? How has accounting been involved in processes of subjectification \u2013 the \nformation and government of \u201ccalculable spaces and calculable selves\u201d (Miller, \n1992)? \nIn pursuing such questions, social and institutional studies of accounting have \nenhanced our understanding of social and behavioural aspects of accounting, its \nconstructed nature, politicizations and performative effects. But the primary \noccupation with accounting in organized settings, at least to a certain extent, has also \ncontributed to the production of blind spots. It has furthered the creation of a \nsituation in which linkages and interplays between accounting and finance, and \naccounting and markets, particularly financial markets, at least from a broader social \nscience viewpoint have largely remained overlooked and under-researched. Not \nmuch is known about the social and cultural roles that accounting numbers play in \n 13 \nthe construction of financial markets. There is no empirically well-grounded \nunderstanding of the relationships that exist (or do not exist) between accounting, \ncapital market structures and investment cultures. Accounting research has not \nproduced much insight into the calculative practices of financial analysts and \ninvestors, and their uses of accounting concepts and figures in the production of \ncorporate valuations. Nor has it come up with sustained investigations exploring in \ndepth the junctions, disparities, commonalities and interrelations between theories \nand models of accounting and finance, the enactment of those relations, and their \nformation and reformation, in diverse settings and cultures of calculation. \nAt least to some extent, the production of such blind spots has been furthered by the \npreoccupation of sociologically oriented accounting research with contexts and \npractices of organizational control and management. But what triggered this \npreoccupation? In part, it may be seen as an (unintended) outcome of processes of \ninner-disciplinary specialization and differentiation. Over the years, in accounting \nresearch and practice, a division of labour has taken shape between management \naccounting scholars, concerned with the roles of accounting in the management of \norganizations, on the one hand, and financial accounting scholars, concerned with \nmarkets, particularly stock market oriented financial reporting, analysis and \nvaluation, on the other. Most sociologically oriented accounting research has been \ncarried out in the field of management accounting. Financial accounting research and \ninvestigations of the roles of accounting in financial markets, with a few notable \nexceptions (see e.g. Macintosh, Shearer, Thornton & Welker, 2000; Roberts, \nSanderson, Barker & Hendry, 2006; Young, 2006), have mainly been the terrain of \nfinancial accounting specialists and economics-based scholarship. In addition, \naccounting and finance represent two historically much related, but institutionally \nincreasingly segregated academic fields of investigation, with separate academic \nassociations, research centres and publication outlets. In recent years, accounting and \nfinance scholars have been seemingly busier with the development and partitioning \nof their own research fields and identities, than with seeking collaboration across the \nfields. Of course, exceptions exist, especially in financial accounting research, but \ngenerally researchers have been careful not to infringe too much upon each others' \nterritory. \nThe papers presented in this special section may offer starting points for altering this \nsituation by illustrating opportunities to explore intersections and points of \nconnection between SSF and accounting research. But in what ways exactly can a \ndialogue with SSF enrich interdisciplinary accounting research? Where can it \ncontribute to the further development of its research agendas, analytical frameworks \nand methodological tools? And what, in turn, can SSF learn from social studies of \naccounting? Where and how can the two strands of research fruitfully complement \nand enrich each other? \nCollaboration between the two fields could prove to be fruitful and beneficial in at \nleast three different respects. (1.) A closer engagement with SSF could contribute to \nthe transcending of current divisions of labour existing between accounting and \nfinance, management accounting and financial accounting research. It could \n 14 \nencourage sociologically oriented accounting scholars to explore more the relevance \nof accounting in and for finance, and it could motivate them to take a closer look at \nactual practices of financial accounting, an area which, as already mentioned above, \nso far, has largely remained neglected by social and institutional accounting research \n(see e.g. Hopwood, 2000). SSF view calculation and the construction of calculability \nas a cooperative, practical achievement. They study the day-to-day production of \nfinancial knowledge in processes of observation, classification, computation and \ncooperation. Calculative practice is seen as a socially and technically embedded \nactivity. As was mentioned earlier, a research framework is employed that places \nemphasis on close up, in situ observations. Such a framework offers to both \naccountants and finance specialists a useful platform for self-reflection. As Hopwood \nhas put it, SSF offer \u201cthe possibility that finance, like most other knowledges, can be \nconfronted by analyses of itself\u201d (Hopwood 2007, THE Supplement, 22.06.07). They \nmake us focus on the intricate socio-technical mechanisms and processes by which \nfinancial knowledge is produced. And they show that similar research frameworks \ncan be used for both the study of accounting and the study of finance. \nIn this context, a closer engagement with SSF could also have the effect that more \nattention will be given to processes of calculative \"hybridisation\" (Miller, Kurunm\u00e4ki \n& O'Leary, 2007) and the connections, commonalities and variations existing between \ndifferent forms of calculative expertise. More collaboration between SSF and \naccounting can sensitize both fields for the embedding of calculative practices in \ncompeting or intersecting institutional and professional realms of expertise with \ndifferent groups of participants. It can help both fields to develop a more \ndifferentiated understanding of the motivations and mechanisms underlying the \nacademic \"disciplining\" of calculative expertise, as well as the reproduction of \nprofessional status groups. It can contribute to the further investigation of the \nentanglement of calculative activities in different, but at times hybridising \nknowledges and their respective carrier groups (e.g. in economics and finance, \naccounting and medicine, accounting and engineering). \n(2.) Increased exposure to SSF is likely to induce accounting research to move the \nstudy of accounting beyond the context of organizations and pay, instead, closer \nattention to how accounting becomes incorporated into knowledges and \ninfrastructures of markets. In return, a closer engagement with accounting research \ncould enhance SSF\u2019s understanding of the relevance of processes of organization for \nmarket creation and involved modes of power and governing styles. Mutually, \nawareness can be raised for the interrelations and dynamics existing between \nprocesses of \u201cfinancialization\u201d, the capture of business by finance and financial \nmarkets (e.g. Fligstein, 1990; Vollmer, 2003, p. 366), on the one hand, and processes of \n\"accountingization\", the proliferation of accounting, audit, risk and performance \nmeasurement into private and public sector organizations (e.g. Kurunm\u00e4ki, Lapsley \n& Melia, 2003; Power, 1999, 2007), on the other. More space for joint research \nprogrammes could be opened up looking into both the organization of markets and \nthe marketization of organizations. Important first steps in this direction have, for \nexample, already been undertaken by Miller and O\u2019Leary (2007) in their paper on \n\"Mediating Instruments\", which looks at investment as an inter-firm and inter-\n 15 \nagency process. Miller and O\u2019Leary examine how certain instruments, like \ntechnology roadmaps and graphical presentations of statistical predictions, act on \ncapital budgeting decisions, thereby, mediating between organizations and markets. \nZorn, Dobbin, Dierkes and Kwok (2005) and Davis and Robbins (2005) have explored \nthe social processes through which financial markets affect the structure and \norganizing principles of corporations. Such research agendas are only emerging. In \norder to gain a fuller picture about interrelations between processes of financial \nintermediation, organizing and market making, more investigations are called for. \n(3.) More collaboration and intellectual exchange between SSF and accounting can \nhelp refine our interdisciplinary understanding of calculative practices and cultures. \nIt can help establish research agendas focussing in more generic terms on conditions \nand consequences of economic calculation and financial numbers \u2013 across accounting \nand finance, organizations, markets and cultures, models and realities. It can \nstimulate the establishment of common analytical ground and, thereby, help advance \nour understanding of general patterns of the use of numbers in social situations. \nMore dialogue between the two fields is likely to further the conduct of more \nsystematic analyses and comparative research into the various ways and mechanisms \nby which financial models, accounting numbers and practices of computation and \ncalculation become involved in the creation, preservation or subversion of social \norder across different settings. \nSuch dialogue might then motivate researchers to more persistently address the \nspecificity of different types of calculation. In his recent appeal \"not to treat practices \nof economic calculation in a somewhat undifferentiated manner\", Miller (2008: 52-\n53), for example, calls for a more refined understanding of such relatively vague and \nuniversalistic notions as \"calculative device\" or \"calculative practice\". More exchange \nbetween SSF and social studies of accounting could stimulate the articulation of \nresearch agendas that would devote more attention to exploring different taxonomies \nof calculation, comparing and contrasting specific properties of different calculative \ninstruments, like financial models, profit computations, performance ratios, budgets \netc., or, as Power (2004) has suggested, distinguish between different classes of \nactivities, e.g. counting, control and calculation, when analyzing attempts aimed at \n\"governing by numbers\" (Rose & Miller, 1992).  The pool of comparative material \nmay be widened (see e.g. Mennicken & Vollmer, 2007) to include not only different \nforms of economic calculation, but also forms of statistical reasoning (e.g. \nDesrosi\u00e8res, 2002; Hacking, 1984; Porter, 1986; MacKenzie 1978), mathematical \n(Heintz, 2003; MacKenzie, 1999) and everyday (Lave 1988) calculative practices. On \nthe basis of a comparative and differentiated understanding of calculative practices, \nresearchers in social studies of finance and accounting may readdress their common \nconcern with what is special about calculating financially after all. \nFielding research in financial numbers: Towards social studies of \nfinance and accounting? \n 16 \nWe would like to conclude this introductory essay with some speculation about what \na common field for research in financial numbers \u2013 across accounting and SSF - \nmight look like, what might constitute its unifying empirical and theoretical themes \nand how its academic discourse could be more fully developed. Just like the \npreceding sections, this will reflect the individual orientations of the contributing \nauthors, and should be taken as an invitation to consider opportunities for locating \nresearch activities in a somewhat broadened field of interdisciplinary research, not as \na summary of a finite or clearly defined set of directions for future research. The \nfollowing considerations thus try to stretch rather than hold back the imagination of \nreaders interested in crossing the boundaries on a more sustained basis. \nBeyond some apparent differences, our brief tour has identified distinctive analytical \nassets SSF and social research in accounting might place in research projects across \ntheir present boundaries. As far as SSF are concerned, a good deal of such assets \nderives from deconstructing and reconstructing the concept of financial information, \nits embedding in webs of mundane cognitive activities, in set-ups of participants, \ntechnologies, models and discourses lumping together interest groups, calculative \npractices, technologies, formal and informal framing devices. The extraordinary \nscope in mobilizing resources from different scientific disciplines that have come to \nbe associated with accounting professionally or academically is perhaps the biggest \nasset accounting research has been producing. Comparatively, its mobilization of \napproaches from organizational research might somewhat stand out, and it might \nsupplement respective weaknesses in SSF.1 \nBesides mutual and complementary analytical interests and theoretical inspirations \n(science and technology studies, actor-network theory etc.), a couple of more specific \nanalytical equivalences could be identified across the fields: take, for example, the \nnotion of an accounting assemblage (Miller & O'Leary, 1996, pp. 125-126) which \nmight adequately (substituting finance for accounting) characterize the \nheterogeneous infrastructural supports and networks of financial cognition; or take \nstudies of performativity in SSF which might shed some light on earlier debates \nabout reality construction (e.g. Neu, 1991; Hines, 1991), or more recently, about \nhyperreality (Macintosh, Shearer, Thornton & Welker, 2000) in accounting. \nExtending such correspondences, one might imagine a series of exemplary mutual \nengagements, of empirical and theoretical issues particularly serviceable for \ncoalescing prior research agendas across SSF and accounting. These exemplary \nengagements might range from dynamics of organization and marketization within \nfinancial cultures, accumulative microstudies of different calculative practices, to \n                                                 \n1  For studies in the broader SSF ancestry, the works of Fligstein (1987, 1990) are an evident \nexception, but preceding the emergence of SSF as a distinct field of research they do not correspond \neasily with SSF's more distinctive concerns with financial cognition, performativity, or most generally: \nfinancial markets. Knorr Cetina and Preda (2005, pp. 3-5) set up the latter as historically struggling to \narticulate itself against the pre-eminence of organizational issues in traditional economic sociology. \nStill, it should be noted that many empirical studies within SSF (e.g. Abolafia, 2005; Kalthoff, 2005) \nexplore social settings that are formally organized, though without investigating much the formal \norganization of calculative practice. \n 17 \nanalyzing the pervasive significance of status groups and, finally, towards exploring \nthe financialization of social life in more general terms. \nExploring how financial cultures are subject to processes of organizing and \nmarketizing might produce opportunities for combining various SSF topics with \naccounting scholars' expertise in the organization of calculative practices, and, \nreciprocally, of making accounting scholarship correspond with SSF research in \nexploring the construction of markets. As performativity studies have been closing in \non links between calculative practices (rules, models, formulas, technical agencies \netc.) and group differences (status groups, stratification), organizations and markets \nmight be seen as settings in with such links are forged or separated: institutionalized \nby organizing access (to information, insider knowledge, expertise, technology) to \nparticipants with membership status and denying it to others, marketized by putting \ngroups of participants into competing, structurally equivalent, or tradeable network \npositions. Formal structures provide shielded spaces, cubicles or ceremonial covers \nfor more informal calculative practices within and across organizations. Market \nstructures appear formally more accessible, but, alongside the workings of price \nmechanisms, they also erect technological and cognitive boundaries of their own \nmaking and allow status groups to establish and gradually expand lateral control \nover strips of market activity. \nMost generally, organizations and markets may be seen as supplementary \nmechanisms for the collective assignment of value. If valuations are arrived at by \norganizational decision-making or by reiterating transactions on markets, neither \nneed the respective processes preclude one another, nor need they draw on \nfundamentally different institutional or technical supports. Accounting systems \ninstitutionalized within organizations, and market participants adopting economic \nmodels may both be seen as endowing formal models (accounting equations, pricing \nformulas etc.) with performative qualities \u2013 both across markets and within formal \norganizations. Considering the similarities of the respective accounting and finance \nassemblages embroiling participants, discourses, institutions and technologies, the \nassociation of formal organization with just those parts of organized social settings \nthat are explicitly claimed to be subject to organizing (standard-setting, governance \nstructures etc.) might then be just as inadequate as seeing markets as perennial \nantagonists of bureaucratization. Analyzing the production and transformation of \nfinancial cultures, one might instead more generally want to ask to what extent \norganizing and marketizing processes, which are both always piecemeal and \nvulnerable to partisan exploitation, transform the ways in which participants handle \nand circulate financial numbers (prices, costs, indicators etc.) within and across \nsettings. Tracking this circulation with an analytical attitude sensitive to the \nconstruction of both markets and organizations within organizations and markets \nshould put social studies of accounting and finance in a unique position for \nobserving how social life is ordered and transformed through the use of financial \nnumbers. \nTackling such questions will require sustained engagements with the microstructures \nof calculative practice. In both SSF and accounting, considerable de-purifications \n 18 \nhave occurred in how calculation and the use of numbers tend to be understood. In \nSSF, basic scepticism towards the trust invested in numbers has been inherited from \nscience and technology studies backgrounds, in accounting research it has been part \nand parcel of locating and analyzing accounting in its social context of operation. The \nimpression of experts in control of circulating inscriptions, \u201cacting at a distance\u201d \n(Latour, 1987) on some subject matter, is as persuasive when thinking about scientists \nand engineers as when observing managers and politicians trying to implement their \nrespective programmes of government, but perhaps the latter has made more \napparent than the former the pervasive experience of failure at the heart of governing \nby numbers (Rose & Miller, 1992, pp. 190-191). Somewhat surprisingly, macro-\ndiagnoses of governing by numbers being propelled into ever more elaborate \nattempts by virtue of perpetually misfiring have yet to be systematically correlated \nwith microstudies of how numbers are produced for circulation (e.g. Pentland, 1993). \nHas the effective combination of science and technology studies (e.g. actor-network \ntheory) with the Foucauldian framework in understanding how social life is brought \nunder the spell of constant measurements, inspections and evaluations gradually \ndiscouraged investigations into the ways in which situated micropractices \nundermine or redirect efforts at acting at a distance?2 In fact, the traditional \n(Mertonian) examples of performativity have tended to highlight destructive effects \nof micropractices (Guala, 2007, p. 136), and stock market crashes may point to \npotential counterperformativities of calculation (MacKenzie, 2007, p. 76). Thus, there \nis a lot to go wrong with producing order through disseminating calculative \npractices, and if participants in markets and organizations tend to know about this \u2013 \nwill they not try to exploit the openings? \nEven governance structures with a surface effectiveness may be host to processes of \ncreative compliance in which the circulation of numbers, its very standardization, \ninspection and \"transparency\" equips participants with effective means of playing at \nthe interests of regulators or co-inmates (Vollmer, 2007, pp. 589-592). If the sociology \nof finance attempts to be a sociology of valuation (Beunza & Stark, 2005, pp. 98-99), it \nwill need to microstudy both \"actual calculative practices of actors at work\" (Beunza \n& Stark, 2005, p. 99), and how participants try to second-guess, outperform, \nhoodwink or abet one another in putting financial numbers on display. Whether \ncalculative practices in this broader sense conform more to a notion of homo \noeconomicus or to one of homo ludens (Huizinga, 1949), is perhaps a question of \nsecondary significance. One way or the other, studying the full spectrum of how \nfinancial numbers are used in social life may help to microtranslate (in the sense of \nCollins, 1981) research issues that have traditionally been articulated on a more \naggregated or macrostructural scale. As questions of government (policy cycles, \ngovernance structures, etc.) are being translated into microstudies of regulation, \n                                                 \n2  Of course, this is not to unilaterally blame the Foucauldian associates within this discursive \nalliance. The criticism of actor-network theory by Mirowski and Nik-Khah (2007), for example, \ncriticizes it for smuggling in mechanistic assumptions, neglecting basic contingencies in the \nproduction of social order, and too hastily subscribing to the fiction of homo oeconomicus (albeit on \nthe basis of social constructivism).  \n 19 \ninvestigations of price-movements may be re-directed towards microstudies of \nvaluation, studies of audit systems towards studies of auditing struggles, as studies \nof market behaviour have been transformed into studies of aggregating microeffects \nof calculative practices spread across market participants (MacKenzie & Millo, 2003). \nStudying the situated use of financial numbers has already gained considerable \nmomentum towards microtranslating research questions regarding information \nsystems, management control, the construction of markets and market participants. \nApart from producing more field research, accounting and finance studies may pick \nup this pace by making more effective use of available microdata, supplementing \n(revising, substituting, ratifying or dismissing specified) appeals to actor-network \ntheory and science and technology approaches by experimenting with other \nsociological, psychological, behavioural, or, dare we say, economic approaches in \nmicrostudying the use of financial numbers. If there is one prevailing weakness \nacross both accounting research and SSF, this may be that effective aggregation of \nqualitative microdata continues to be scarce. There is a great wealth of case studies \nand most of them attempt to generalize their cases towards theoretical issues \u2013 yet \nthese issues tend to be situated on superordinate structural or epistemological levels. \nGeneralized observations about calculative practice as a microphenomenon tend to \nbe derived from theory, with case studies serving as illustrations. The recent volume \non performativity (MacKenzie, Muniesa & Siu, 2007) is a rare exception, but such \ndiscussions have yet to open up to issues and approaches beyond those traditionally \ncultivated in science and technology studies environments. What about \nmicrosociology and its recent wave of theorizing (e.g. Turner, 2002; Collins, 2004; \nScheff, 1990)? What about the challenge posed by sociological microanalyses \nepistemologically close to economic paradigms (Coleman, 1990) and, for example, \ntheir understanding of social mechanisms (Hedstr\u00f6m & Swedberg 1998)? Where is \nthe line between the systematic study of micropatterns and becoming too \n\"mechanistic\" about them? \nOne way to programmatically link microanalyses of calculative practices to macro-\nexplorations of calculative regimes may be the observation of organizing and \nmarketizing processes, another may be the investigation of framing (Callon, 1998b; \nAbolafia, 2005; Vollmer 2007), or the study of linkages between calculative practices \nand political rationalities (Miller & Rose, 1990; Miller, 2008). Yet another may be to \nlook more closely at trajectories of participants across situations. SSF with its \nextended understanding of calculative agency clearly suggest adopting a wide notion \nof participation in understanding calculative practices. Here, human participants \ninteract not just with other human participants but with formulas, models and \ntechnological artefacts. The role of status groups, apparent on financial markets as \nmuch as in the professional jurisdictions of accounting and auditing though clearly \nmight be worth exploring further and more methodically, and this, in the first place, \nmight involve tracing the trajectories of well-seasoned human expert participants. \nThe use of numbers appears to generate and reproduce inequality not just among \nindividuals, but very dramatically among different groups of participants. How \ngroups of financial experts claim jurisdiction on producing, interpreting, delivering \n 20 \nand receiving numbers and how they are able to uphold their claims in the face of \ncompeting expertise, state interventions or \"layman\" resistance, are questions \nintrinsically linked to the ability of these status groups to invade new areas of social \nlife. Reproducing status group jurisdictions will often mean keeping control over the \ncirculation of financial numbers, and keeping control over circulation will often \nmean reproducing status groups \u2013 in the sense of maintaining and policing their \nboundaries, but also in the sense of generating a stable flow of adequately trained \nparticipants able to occupy the respective status positions (Anderson-Gough, Grey & \nRobson, 1998; Young, 2006). Producing and sustaining status distinctions, is a \nquestion of distributing cognitive activities and abilities unequally across a \npopulation of participants, of maintaining an unequal distribution of access and \nknowledge, and lashing the circulation of financial numbers in ways that attract \nparticipants to particular status groups leading them to invest in training, careers \nand identities, committing them to specific jurisdictions, and rewarding retention. \nThe financialization of social life goes along with the mobilization of accounting \nexpertise, and the accountingization of organizations, markets and cultures is \nsimilarly associated with the ascendancy of finance in business and in everyday life, \nthe rise of financial markets, financial expertise and its status groups. Clearly, the \nslogans of financialization and accountingization are handy denominators for net \neffects of financial numbers invading and circulating across different settings of \ninteraction. A comprehensive understanding of these net effects might be the \nultimate long-term objective of social studies of accounting and finance. What \nremains particular about the use of numbers in social situations, and this might \naccount for the apparent appeal of actor-network theory in both accounting and SSF, \nis the unique ability of financial numbers to embed individual situations, which pass \nby all by themselves, in larger social settings, structures, networks and organizations, \ngiving situated behaviour a significance symptomatically outliving its happening. \nSimilar embedding effects can be observed with other, non-financial kinds of \nnumbers (e.g. school grades), but having numbers refer to money does appear to be \nparticularly effective in bringing situations in line with trans-situational flows of \nresources, programmes, discourses, projects, and status-group participants. When \ncontrasting different forms of introducing universals into social situations (other \npotential claimants being norms or knowledge), is it a coincidence that \"a form of \nfinancialism looks set to replace scientism\" (Power, 1994b, p. 3) at a time when \nglobalization processes have exponentially gained latitude? How does the circulation \nof financial numbers then mediate and translate between the global and local? And \nhow is financialization reflected in everyday life, in its organized and less organized, \nwork and leisure settings? \nThe kind of research field in which engagements like these could coalesce might be \nidentified as a distinct, interdisciplinary accounting and finance track in the academic \ndiscourse of social science, a strip of discursive engagements constituting a \nprivileged attention space for research exploring the role of financial numbers in \nsocial life. The existence of this accounting and finance track constitutes a somewhat \nironic discursive counterpoint to the increasingly institutionally codified segregation \n 21 \nof accounting and finance specializations in the organization of academic life. \nAcknowledging such barriers, a good strategy to transcend the respective \npartitioning of intellectual attention space (cf. Collins, 1998, pp. 37-40) may be to \nformulate more ambitious and, if you will, aggressive research programmes claiming \nacademic jurisdiction across accounting and finance issues. Such programmes may \nbe a prime lever for regenerating attention and discursive engagements across \ninstitutional barriers. \nTracking financial numbers \u2013 imagining a strong programme \nProjecting the potential of this accounting and finance track, we would therefore like \nto conclude with a more strategic note posing the question of field formation. In \nscience and technology studies, the \u201cstrong programme\u201d in the sociology of scientific \nknowledge put forward by David Bloor in 1976 provided something of a founding \ndocument (cf. Bloor 1992, pp. 3-23). The strong programme claimed jurisdiction on \nexplaining scientific knowledge for the emergent post-Mertonian field that was soon \nto align itself with studies of technology. Bloor\u2019s \"strong programme\" provided this \nfield with an initial statement of ambition and attracted discursive engagement \nacross established scientific disciplines. The affirmative continuations and sharp \ncriticisms it attracted, the subsequent qualifications and modifications it incurred \nwithin science and technology studies all attest to its major impetus and its \ncontinuing role as a point of reference (cf. Lynch, 1993, pp. 71-102) - even actor-\nnetwork theory as one of the most exacting criticisms of the strong programme from \nwithin science and technology studies has presented itself as a qualified response to \nit (e.g. Latour 1993, pp. 94-96). In transposing this sociological programme towards \nan interdisciplinary field of accounting and finance studies, paraphrasing Bloor \n(1992, p. 7) as closely as possible, a strong programme would read something like \nthis (italics indicating deviations from Bloor's original formulation): \n1. It would be causal, that is concerned with the conditions which bring about \ncalculative practices and their effects. Naturally, there will be other types of causes apart \nfrom social ones (...). \n2. It would be impartial with respect to the truth or falsity, rationality or irrationality, \nsuccess or failures of calculative performances and outcomes, valuations, networks of \ncirculation, accounting regimes, or programmes of governing by numbers. Both sides of \nsuch dichotomies will require explanation. \n3. It would be symmetrical in its style of explanation. The same types of cause would \nexplain, say, true and false numbers, calculative practices, effective or defective accounting \nsystems, calculative agencies or regimes. \n4. It would be reflexive. In principle its patterns of explanation would have to be \napplicable to its own use and understanding of numbers and calculative practices. (...) Like \nthe requirement of symmetry this is a response to the need to seek for general \n 22 \nexplanations. It is an obvious requirement of principle because otherwise accounting \nand finance studies would be a standing refutation of their own theories.3 \nAre causal explanations of calculative practices and their effects (ad 1), explaining \nboth successes and failures (ad 2), doing so symmetrically (ad 3), and being reflexive \nabout this (ad 4) goals accounting and finance studies should aspire to? What further \nmodulations of the strong programme are called for to bring it in tune with current \naccounting and finance studies\u2019 concerns? Is there potential for an even stronger \nprogramme? Can a truly strong programme really be an interdisciplinary \nprogramme or do more ambitious research goals require a disciplinary footing? Are \nthere disciplines more amenable to or, for that matter, of superior qualification for \nimplementing a strong programme in social accounting and finance studies? And \nsupposing that respective research will continue to be carried out in accounting and \nfinance departments, with researchers educating future accounting and finance \nprofessionals, will the strong programme's reflexivity postulate not need to be \nsomewhat radicalized? To what extent will accounting and finance studies want to \nbecome performative? And would this force its researchers to recast themselves more \ndeliberately as a status group? \nThese are questions that cannot be answered here. They concern political as well as \nacademic economies, relate to academic network-building, questions of scientific \njurisdiction, and, too a great extent, as Bloor's last proposition has it, to scientific \nreflexivity. As guest editors of this special section, one essential motivation for \nposing questions like the above is to invite the readers of this journal to reflect not \nonly on the underlying theoretical and empirical issues, but also on their own \npositions and engagements in the emerging accounting and finance track. How \nwould strong programmes in social studies of finance and accounting relate to \nresearch projects across the fields? To what extent would research need to refine and \nflesh out the substance of such programmes? To what extent will discursive and \ninstitutional boundaries thus be reaffirmed or redrawn? The contributions to this \nspecial section constitute suggestions for intensifying discursive engagements across \nthe fields in one or the other direction. They demonstrate more substantially what \nthis introductory essay could merely sketchily illustrate: that the emerging \naccounting and finance track in academic discourse is based on a tangible \nconvergence of quite fundamental research interests across the fields of accounting \nand SSF.  \n                                                 \n3  Cf. the full original formulation by David Bloor: \"1. It would be causal, that is, concerned with \nthe conditions which bring about belief or states of knowledge. Naturally there will be other types or \ncauses apart from social ones which will cooperate in bringing about belief. 2. It would be impartial \nwith respect to truth and falsity, rationality or irrationality, success or failure. Both sides of these \ndichotomies will require explanation. 3. It would be symmetrical in its style of explanation. The same \ntypes of cause would explain, say, true or false beliefs. 4. It would be reflexive. In principle its pattern \nof explanation would have to be applicable to sociology itself. Like the requirement of symmetry this \nis a response to the need to seek for general explanations. It is an obvious requirement of principle \nbecause otherwise sociology would be a standing refutation of its own theories.\" (Bloor, 1992, p. 7) \n 23 \nR E F E R E N C E S :  \nAbolafia, M. Y.
