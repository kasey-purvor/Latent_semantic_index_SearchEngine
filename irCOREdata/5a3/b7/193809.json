However, despite extensive investigations,\n\u2217\nNow at: Compagnie Generale de Geophysique, c\/o BP Exploration\nAberdeen, Farburn Industrial Estate, Dyce, Aberdeen, AB21 7PB, UK.\n\u2020Now at: PGS Marine Geophysical, Strandveien 4, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.\nthe role of tectonic extension and graben formation in the architec-\nture of the Troodos oceanic crust are still unclear. Also crustal layer\nthickness and the nature of the underlying mantle, both of which\nhave significant implication concerning the formation conditions of\nthis supra-subduction zone oceanic crust, are poorly known. This is\nlargely because geological studies have been carried out using im-\nperfect exposures with relatively little vertical control. To overcome\nmany of these problems the Investigations Around North Troodos\nusing Gravity And Seismic Surveys (IANGASS) geophysical survey\nwas conducted in 1995. This consisted of a coincident wide-angle\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors 1385\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n1386 G. D. Mackenzie et al.\nreflection\/refraction seismic and gravity profile across the sheeted\ndykes, extrusives and sediments of the northern part of the Troodos\nophiolite complex, with the following original objectives:\n(1) To investigate the internal architecture of the upper crust,\nto determine crustal thickness and to examine the upper mantle\nstructure beneath the ophiolite.\n(2) To delineate the structure of three proposed grabens [the\nSolea, Mitsero and Larnaca graben] and comment on their interpre-\ntation as spreading centres.\n(3) To test existing models for the origin of tectonic extension\nin the sheeted dyke complex and to investigate whether this is rooted\nin a detachment at the dyke-gabbro transition or whether faults pen-\netrate this boundary.\nTE C T O N I C A N D G E O L O G I C A L\nB A C K G R O U N D\nThe Troodos ophiolite formed in a supra-subduction zone setting\n(Miyashiro 1973) in the Late Cretaceous (ca. 91 Ma; Mukasa &\nLudden 1987). It is exposed over a large area (Fig. 1) and has an over-\nall domal geometry centred on Mt Olympus. The core of the dome\nis serpentinized mantle peridotite; this is surrounded by a plutonic\nthen a sheeted dyke complex (SDC) with overlying extrusive lavas\nand sediments. The lava sequence has been divided, based on field\ncharacteristics and geochemistry, into an upper and a lower sequence\nFigure 1. Simplified geological map of the Troodos ophiolite (based on maps from the Geological Survey of Cyprus). Inset shows the tectonic setting of the\nregion (after Robertson 1998). The location of the IANGASS geophysical profile is indicated by the red line. CY-n identify the locations of the Cyprus Crustal\nStudy Project (CCSP) boreholes (Salisbury et al. 1989). WGS 84 UTM location zone 36N.\n(Wilson 1959; Gass 1960). The sheeted dyke complex, which is ex-\ncellently exposed, consists of generally north\u2013south trending dykes\nindicating east\u2013west spreading in the present geographic framework.\nA gradational \u2018basal\u2019 or transitional layer (e.g. Bear 1960) comprised\nof a variable proportion of dykes and lavas has been identified above\nthe sheeted dyke complex. The underlying plutonics are less well\nexposed than the sheeted dykes. They are characterized by a com-\nplex mixture of felsic, mafic and ultramafic cumulates. There is no\nconsistent distribution of these lithologies with depth in the crust\nalthough there are greater proportions of felsic intrusions at shallow\nlevels and ultramafic intrusions at depth.\nMany aspects of the post-formation history of the Troodos ophi-\nolite are controversial. A simplified model can be summarized as\nfollows.\nPalaeomagnetic studies show that the Troodos ophiolite has ro-\ntated ca. 90\u25e6 anticlockwise since its formation with most of this\nrotation occurring before the end of the Early Eocene (within\n40 Myr of ophiolite formation) (e.g. Clube et al. 1985). The sed-\nimentary succession overlying the ophiolite shows that this rota-\ntion was followed by periods of compression and uplift forming\nthe dome-like structure and leading to emergence of the Troodos\noceanic crust above sea level. Robertson (1998) suggests the unbro-\nken sedimentary cover through the Late Cretaceous into the Tertiary\nrules out the classical model in which the ophiolite was emplaced by\nlong-distance thrusting onto the Arabian continental margin in the\nLate Cretaceous (e.g. Dercourt et al. 1993).

The central portion of the ophiolite,\naround Mt Olympus was uplifted rapidly, probably due to the up-\nward motion of a deep serpentinite diapir, now exposed at the sur-\nface. He adds that the impingment of the Eratosthenes seamount on\nthe Cyprus trench during ongoing subduction to the south of the is-\nland, was also important in the upwarping of the Troodos ophiolite.\nCompositional studies suggest that the mantle section of the ophi-\nolite can be divided into a partially serpentinized (ca. 40 per cent)\nharzburgite formed as a residue of melting to form the ophiolite crust\nand an almost totally serpentinized core that has been juxtaposed\nwith the ophiolite by these later tectonic movements (e.g. Batanova\n& Sobolev 2000).\nThe present-day Cyprus-trench (Fig. 1), along which the Sinai\nmicroplate is subducted beneath Cyprus, lies ca. 50 km south of the\nisland (e.g. Mascle et al. 2000). Weak and diffuse seismicity beneath\nCyprus indicates that subduction may now have virtually ceased\nalong the Cyprus Arc (Kempler & Ben-Avraham 1987) and that\nthe margin is in transition from subduction to collision (Robertson\n1998). To the west of the Troodos complex lies the Polis graben, a\nlate Miocene basin located in a region of inferred supra-subduction\nzone extension (e.g. Payne & Robertson 1995).\nM O D E L S F O R T H E S P R E A D I N G\nE V O L U T I O N O F T H E T R O O D O S C R U S T\nA number of studies have proposed a relatively simple spreading\nhistory for the Troodos ophiolite. Kidd & Cann (1974) showed that\nthere is a slight preference for dykes to show eastern side chilled\nmargins over western side chills implying that the ophiolite formed\nat a spreading centre to the west of the ophiolite. A subsequent study\nby Baragar et al. (1990) also found that on average, east side chills\nare more abundant but suggested that this was not statistically sig-\nnificant. Ages of the oldest sediment overlying the ophiolite, based\non limited radiolarian ages, lend some support to a spreading centre\nto the west of the ophiolite (Osozawa & Okamura 1993); however,\nthese data are too limited to be conclusive. A simple spreading his-\ntory has also been proposed based on the relatively thin transition\nbetween the sheeted dyke and lava complexes which suggests that\nmost dykes were intruded in a relatively narrow zone at the ridge\naxis (Cann 1970, 1974).\nA more complex spreading history for the ophiolite has been sug-\ngested from the study of dyke orientations, along with paleomag-\nnetic studies of dyke rotations. Varga & Moores (1985) proposed that\nthe geometry of dykes within the SDC defines three approximately\nnorth\u2013south trending grabens with dykes dipping inwards on each\nof their flanks. These were interpreted as fossil spreading centres.\nCross-cutting relationships within the SDC led them to suggest that\nthe oldest spreading centre was located in the vicinity of Solea and\nthe youngest close to Larnaca with an intermediate-age spreading\ncentre located between these two near Mitsero (Fig. 2a). At least\ntwo of the proposed grabens (Solea and Mitsero) are asymmetric\nwith broader western sides (defined by eastward-dipping dykes) than\neastern sides (defined by westward-dipping dykes). They note that\nthe sediments overlying the ophiolite are only slightly deformed and\ndip gently to the north, which requires dyke rotation prior to sedi-\nment deposition. However, palaeomagnetic studies show that dykes\nwere rotated after high-temperature (ca. 300\u25e6C) alteration (Varga\net al. 1999). Varga & Moores (1985) propose that the dyke rotations\nroot into a basal detachment, such as the Kakopetria detachment be-\nneath the Solea graben where subhorizontal dykes overlie plutonic\nrocks.\nThis picture of three fossil spreading centres has been questioned.\nAllerton & Vine (1987) suggest that the large areas of the ophio-\nlite that display a simple internal structure, including near-vertical\ndykes, and the subdued topography on the lava-sediment interface,\nsupport a simpler mode of accretion. In 1991 they suggested that\nspreading originated in the vicinity of the present Solea graben, the\nMitsero graben resulting from off-axis tectonic extension to the east\nof the ridge axis. The spreading ridge then jumped to the east to the\nvicinity of the present Larnaca graben. There followed a period of\nlargely amagmatic stretching which formed the structures that now\ndefine the Solea graben. Allerton & Vine (1991) suggest that the Lar-\nnaca graben itself may be analagous to the Solea graben, forming\nin a discrete stretching event, which may or may not be associated\nwith the later abandonment of the new ridge in the present Larnaca\ngraben. In a detailed study of dyke orientations Van Everdingen &\nCawood (1995) show that there are many domains of apparently con-\nsistent dyke orientations that do not necessarily fit the simple three\ngraben model. Furthermore, the detachment fault near the base of\nthe sheeted dyke complex described in the Solea area (Varga &\nMoores 1985) is clearly absent in other areas.\nAlternative models for deformation partitioning within the\noceanic crust have been proposed based on the Troodos ophiolite.\nAgar & Klitgord (1995) suggested that deformation is decoupled\nbetween the sheeted dyke complex and the plutonic complex based\nlargely on the observation that dykes and faults in the plutonic com-\nplex dip west while they dip east in the sheeted dyke complex. How-\never, Coogan et al. (2002) show that many of the dykes intruding\nthe plutonics are more depleted in incompatible trace elements than\nthose in the sheeted dyke complex. This suggests that they may not\nhave all been intruded as vertical parallel sheets at the same time,\nfollowed by differential rotation as required by Agar & Klitgord\n(1995). Other models suggest decoupling between the deformation\nin the lavas and sheeted dyke complex, incorporating two phases of\nlava rotation (e.g. Schouten & Denham 2000).\nThe IANGASS project was designed to examine the internal ar-\nchitecture of the Troodos crust as well as to sample the immediate\nupper mantle. Identification of faults cross-cutting the ophiolite lay-\ners was intended to throw light on the validity of the various models\ndescribed above.\nP R E V I O U S G E O P H Y S I C A L S T U D I E S\nWhile there have been several seismic surveys offshore Cyprus\n(e.g. Makris et al. 1983; Ben-Avraham et al. 1995) onshore geo-\nphysical studies of the Troodos Ophiolite have been primarily based\non gravity surveys. Gass & Masson-Smith (1963) interpeted such\nsurveys conducted in 1946 and 1958 and proposed a cone shaped low\ndensity granitic boss, or a diapirically emplaced serpentine body, to\nexplain a localized circular negative anomaly concident with the\nsummit of Mt Olympus. A detailed gravity survey of the Mt Olym-\npus region itself was conducted by Shelton (1993). The results were\nexplained in terms of a fully serpentinized mantle body of less than\n10 km in diameter extending to an average depth of 15 km within\naltered depleted mantle. Shelton (1993) modelled a Moho thinning\nfrom 10 km depth beneath the southern coast of Cyprus to outcrop\non Mt Olympus and then deepening to 4 km depth 30 km to the\nnorth of Mt Olympus.

They modelled a 35-km-thick \u2018conti-\nnental crust\u2019 beneath this part of their profile, thinning southwards.\nAs ray coverage was poor beneath Cyprus their model was partially\nconstrained using gravity data. Ergu\u00a8n et al. (2005) modelled four\ngravity profiles across the Cyprus arc, one near north\u2013south crossing\nthe Eratosthenes seamount and the Troodos ophiolite (Fig. 2a). This\nwas interpreted in terms of thick sediments over the plate bound-\nary suture with thinned continental crust beneath the Eratosthenes\nseamount to the south. The gravity high on Cyprus was interpreted\nas being caused by a combination of the Troodos ophiolite (mod-\nelled as an \u223c2 km thick body of density 3.0 g cm\u22123, thinner than\nsuggested by geological studies) and a thinning of the sedimentary\nsection above continental crust that is thinner (20 km) than that sug-\ngested by Makris et al. (1983) to the west of the Troodos ophiolite.\nKhan et al. (1972) conducted a \u223c20 km long seismic refraction\nsurvey along the northern margin of the ophiolite between Skouri-\notissa (SKO) and Mitsero (MIT) (Fig. 2a), obtaining a three layered\ncrustal model using the plus-minus method of interpretation (Hage-\ndoorn 1959). The model was interpreted in terms of a thin (0.5 km)\nlayer of mean velocity 3.25 km s\u22121 interpreted as pillow lavas, above\na basal layer with velocity approximately 5.2 km s\u22121, overlying a\nlayer of velocity 6.38 km s\u22121 at a depth of about 1.5\u20132.0 km, thought\nto be the \u2018diabase\u2019 or sheeted dyke unit. Lort & Matthews (1972)\nshot 16 short (200\u20131300 m) seismic profiles, each confined to a\nsingle constituent rock type of the ophiolite complex, to determine\nvelocities within that lithology. Velocities were again calculated us-\ning the plus-minus method of Hagedoorn (1959). The objective was\nto compare the velocities with those of oceanic crust obtained from\nmarine refraction profiles. However, the velocities obtained were\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 167, 1385\u20131401\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nCrustal architecture of the Troodos ophiolite 1389\nlower than expected with velocities ranging from 2.8 km s\u22121 in the\npillow lavas to 5.5 km s\u22121 in the gabbros and only 3.8 km s\u22121 in\nthe ultramafic rocks. The relatively low velocities were attributed\nto the high fracturing and alteration of the Troodos rocks. A princi-\npal outcome was the suggestion that the boundary between oceanic\nseismic layer 2 and layer 3 may represent a reduction in bulk poros-\nity from the closure of cracks by overburden pressure rather than a\npetrological or metamorphic boundary. More recent studies around\ndeep Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill holes have confirmed that\nthis seismic boundary does not simply correlate with a lithological\nboundary as discussed in detail below. Both the Lort & Matthews\n(1972) and Khan et al. (1972) profiles were too short to sample\ndeeper layers.\nA survey including four nominal 12 km seismic refraction pro-\nfiles in the vicinity of Mathiatis (MAT, Fig. 2a) resulted in a model\nof sediments and the upper extrusive layer (VP 2.2\u20132.7 km s\u22121)\noverlying the lower extrusive layer and basal group (VP 3.1\u20134.3 km\ns\u22121) above the sheeted dyke complex (VP 5.1\u20135.5 km s\u22121) (Cooper\n1993).\nIn the late 1980s the Cyprus Crustal Study Project (CCSP) drilled\na series of holes (Figs 1 and 2a) designed to sample the complete\nophiolite sequence. Downhole logging in CY-4 and a number of pre-\nviously drilled shallow holes provided velocity, density and electri-\ncal properties for the ophiolite sequence (Salisbury et al. 1989) (see\nTable 4). Velocities of 3.2\u20133.5 km s\u22121 were obtained in the extrusive\nlavas, 5\u20136.4 km s\u22121 in the SDC and 6.7\u20136.9 km s\u22121 in the gabbros.\nVelocities of 7\u20137.4 km s\u22121 were logged in the underlying pyrox-\nenites. Laboratory measurements on samples from CY-1 (Smith &\nVine 1991), CY-2 (Smith & Vine 1987) and CY-4 (Smith & Vine\n1989) provided a range of values for the lavas (which included both\nhighly altered and fresh flows and intrusives) averaging at \u223c3.5 km\ns\u22121. Velocities averaged \u223c4.8 km s\u22121 in the sheeted dykes in CY-1,\n1a, 2 and 2a, and \u223c6.5 km s\u22121 in CY-4. In CY-4 the average velocity\nfor the gabbro was 6.93 km s\u22121 and for the ultramafics was 7.26\nkm s\u22121, being equivalent to the logged velocities. In CY-4 logged\ndensities increase from 2.2 to 2.3 g cm\u22123 in the pillow lavas to\n2.6\u20132.8 g cm\u22123 in the dykes, 2.9\u20132.95 g cm\u22123 in the gabbros and\n3.1 g cm\u22123 in the ultramafics (Salisbury et al. 1989) being equivalent\nto those identified from the laboratory measurements of Smith &\nVine (1987, 1989, 1991). In general the logged formation velocity\nand densities were found to be lower than those of the rock samples\nprimarily due to the effects of porosity and anisotropy (Salisbury\net al. 1989).\nT H E I A N G A S S 1 9 9 5 P RO J E C T\nThe IANGASS 1995 project involved the joint acquisition of a\nwide-angle seismic reflection\/refraction and coincident gravity pro-\nfile across the Troodos Ophiolite complex, extending from near the\ncentre of the ophiolite eastwards into the circum-Troodos sedimen-\ntary succession (Figs 1 and 2). Gravity measurements were made\nat 239 stations located along the length of the IANGASS seismic\nprofile from AKA to PAR (Fig. 2). A local gravity network of 19\nbase stations was established and linked to a gravity reference sta-\ntion at Malounda, near the centre of the profile. The roving station\nmeasurements were taken in loops, starting and ending at a base\nstation, to enable correction for instrument drift.\nThe acquisition of the wide-angle reflection\/refraction profile was\nconducted in three deployments (Fig. 2b) during the spring of 1995.\nOver the three deployments a total of 196 seismic stations recorded\nup to 29 shots of between 50 and 600 kg. Station spacing was variable\nwith a denser nominal 250 m spacing across the proposed spread-\ning centres (the Solea, Mitsero and Larnaca grabens). The seismic\ninstrumentation used for the survey consisted of a combination of\nTeledyne PDAS 100 and Reftek 72A digital recorders connected, for\nthe most part, to vertical component 4.5 Hz geophones. The dense\nstation spacing within the centre of each deployment was obtained\nby connecting vertical component geophones to all three channels\nof each recorder, two being deployed at the end of 250 m cables. A\nsmall number of instruments were kept fixed throughout the entire\nsurvey to provide reciprocal times for long offset recordings and\nduplicate recordings for quality control. These were mostly three\ncomponent Willmore 1 Hz seismometers. Site locations were de-\nrived from GPS receivers. The majority of the sites had permanent\nGPS antennae synchronizing the recorders internal time signal every\n60 min while the remainder had their internal clocks synchronized\ndaily to GPS time by field crews. Time corrections for clock drift\nwere calculated and applied to each seismic trace individually.\nDATA M O D E L L I N G\nSeismic modelling\nSection description and phase picking\nThe complete seismic data set has been combined into shot-gathers,\nconverted into SEGY format, corrected for the time drift of the inter-\nnal clocks and displayed using ZP, an interactive plotting and picking\nsoftware package (B. Zelt, personal communication, 2003). Exam-\nple vertical component seismic sections are shown in Figs 3(a\u2013d).\nWhile increasing the station density over the central section of each\ndeployment, the use of a large number of cables for the recordings\nalso resulted in higher noise levels. The experiment was undertaken\nat a time when severe distant electrical storms occurred resulting in\nsignificant electrical induction with signals being recorded by the\ncables, these being in effect a 500 m \u2018ground aerial\u2019 deployed from\nmany of the recorders. While the raw data set displayed a clear seis-\nmic structure, the resulting filtered signals showed severe ringing\nwith a dominant frequency of the order of 12\u201318 Hz (Figs 3a\u2013\nd). However, the principal phases of interest (first arrivals and a\nnumber of second arrivals correlated over significant distances) are\nclearly visible on the resultant sections. Possibly because of the se-\nvere electrical noise, the identification of shear-wave energy has\nproved extremely difficult. The small number of three-component\nseismometers did not prove sufficient to provide confidence in\nS-phase identification on the vertical component recordings.\nDespite the difficulties with data acquisition, we consider the\nP-wave data quality to be good with first arrival energy propagation\ndependent on charge size but observed to \u223c90 km offset for the\nlargest charges (Fig. 3d). The sections all show first arrivals with\nhigh apparent velocities (>5 km s\u22121) at only \u223c5 km offset. Sev-\neral strong reflectors are visible with a deep reflector observed to\n\u223c120 km from shotpoint PAR (Fig. 3d). To aid the identification of\ntraveltime phases, traveltime reciprocity was checked where possi-\nble (Zelt 1999). Traveltimes were picked using ZP, the picks being\nassigned an error (Table 1) based on the signal to noise ratio of the\ndata within a 0.25 s time window around the traveltime pick. This\npicking error was then used to weight the traveltimes during the\ninversion procedure.\nSeismic tomography\nModelling of the IANGASS 1995 wide-angle seismic data set was\nconducted using both a minimum structure tomographic approach\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 167, 1385\u20131401\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n1390 G.

The first arrival seismic\ntomography (FAST) regularized inversion algorithm (Zelt & Barton\n1998) was used to create a 2-D tomographic model beneath the\nbest-fit line through the whole IANGASS profile using the picked\nfirst arrival traveltimes. The software utilizes a regularized inversion\nwith a combination of smallest, flattest and smoothest perturbation\nconstraints which are specified by the user. The inversion uses a least\nsquares variation of the conjugate gradient technique. The algorithm\nautomatically tests a number of damping values (\u03bb) during each\niteration to assess which gives the best solution. This solution is a\ntrade off between minimizing the agreement of the model to the data\nand the smoothness or stability of the solution. The starting model\nwas taken to be a simple 1-D model which was firstly inverted with no\ndamping. However, a smoothing filter was applied to the model after\neach iteration to allow the long wavelength features to be derived.\nThis smoothed 2-D model was then used as a starting model for\na second run of the inversion routine where a variety of damping\nvalues were tested at each iteration to produce a final model (Fig. 4).\nThe seismic tomography model\nThe resulting final model (Fig. 4) shows high velocities of >6 km\ns\u22121 at relatively shallow depths across the main section of the profile\n(KAM\u2013KEL PYL) with a very high velocity body (>7 km s\u22121) at\n4 km depth between shotpoints KAM and AYI, shallowing between\nNIK and AYI.

In or-\nder to minimize the errors associated with the assumption of a 2-D\nprofile, especially in the near surface, it was decided to model the\nshallow (<5 km) structure as three distinct profiles: KAM\u2013NIK,\nNIK\u2013MAT and MAT\u2013KEL PYL. These were then merged and used\nas a starting model for modelling the deeper structure as one profile.\nInitial models were obtained through trial and error forward mod-\nelling to fit the picked traveltimes using a top-down layer stripping\napproach. These models were then refined via damped least squares\ninversion to minimize the traveltime residuals. The resultant trav-\neltime velocity model was subsequently refined, mainly regarding\nthe vertical velocity gradients, based on qualitative comparison of\nthe record sections with synthetic seismograms calculated using the\nTRAMP code of Zelt & Forsyth (1994).\nThe seismic ray trace model\nThe final velocity model obtained with the seismic ray tracing\nmethod is shown in Fig. 5.

The rms traveltime residual generally de-\ncreases with each iteration until a minimum is reached. The misfit\nparameter \u03c72 also in general reduces with each iteration, with unity\nindicating a good solution within the picking uncertainties. Values\nmuch less than 1 indicate that the data have been overmodelled, that\nis, they have been fit closer than is justified by the uncertainties and\nthe model may contain structure that is not required.

Ray coverage is shown in terms of the\nray density for the tomographic model (Fig. 6a), that is, the number\nof rays sampling each node or cell of the model. For the RAYINVR\nmodels it is given in terms of ray diagrams (Fig. 7) showing the two-\npoint ray paths connecting the shot and receiver whose associated\ntimes are the earliest for a particular receiver or phase (Zelt 1999).\nFig. 6(b) also shows the traveltime misfit for the final tomographic\nmodel.\nErrors associated with the interface depths and velocites have\nbeen assessed through model perturbation and are estimated as\n0.2 km s\u22121 for the velocities of the upper three layers and 0.3 km s\u22121\nfor the lower three layers. The interface depth errors are estimated\nas 0.15, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 km for the five layer boundaries.\nGravity data processing and modelling\nThe gravity data reduction to calculate the Bouguer anomaly fol-\nlowed the standard method outlined below:\n(1) Conversion to the observed gravity value with reference to\nthe Malounda base station value of 979 835.95 mgal.\n(2) Calculation of the theoretical sea level gravity using the 1967\nInternational Gravity Formula (IAG 1971).\n(3) Calculation of the free air anomaly (FAA).\n(4) Calculation of the simple Bouguer anomaly (SBA) using a\nreplacement density of 2.67 g cm\u22123 (Shelton 1993).\n(5) Calculation of the corrected Bouguer anomaly (CBA)\nthrough the application of terrain corrections to a standard outer\nzone radius of 167 km and accounting for the curvature of the Earth\n(Swain & Khan 1977).\nThe Bouguer anomaly profile (Fig. 8) shows a positive anomaly\nassociated with the ophiolite, decreasing eastwards.

A\n2-D density model was created using the interfaces defined by the\nseismic model and assigning densities to these layers. The maxi-\nmum depth of the model was 30 km, and the model was linearly\nextended to \u00b11000 km beyond the limits of the seismic profile to\nreduce end effects. Initial density values were assigned using a com-\nbination of (a) the conversion of modelled seismic velocities to den-\nsity values using empirical relationships (e.g. Bartetzko et al. 2005;\nChristensen & Salisbury 1975), (b) measured density values from\nhand specimens and boreholes cores (Smith & Vine 1987, 1989,\n1991; Salisbury et al. 1989), (c) previous density modelling (Shelton\n1993) and (d) modern oceanic analogues (e.g. Carlson & Herrick\n1990). The anomaly calculated from this initial starting model had\na reasonably close fit to the CBA data, lending confidence to the\nseismic model. The major disparities required the long-wavelength\npositive anomaly over the Troodos complex to be extended towards\nboth ends of the profile, and the presence of a short wavelength\nanomaly \u2018trough\u2019 in the region around Mathiatis (MAT) (Figs 1\nand 2).\nThe initial model was refined to provide a final density model giv-\ning a theoretical anomaly that closely matches the observed (Fig. 8).\nThe perturbation of the layer interface depths and densities was con-\ntrolled by the resolution of the seismic model with larger perturba-\ntions allowed where resolution was poor. Final velocity and density\nvalues for each layer are shown in Table 3.\nThe final density model (Fig. 8c) shows a similar structure to the\nseismic model involving eastward dipping layers, the deeper lev-\nels progressively outcropping to the west. The major offsets in the\nlayer boundaries beneath ATS, MIT and AGR have become more\ndistinctive and an offset in the upper layers beneath GOS has also\nbecome apparent. The sediments of the Polis graben and within the\ncircum Troodos sedimentary succession are modelled as being \u223c4\nkm thick but this is very poorly constrained. The principal difference\nbetween the gravity and seismic models is in the lateral extent of\nthe ophiolite sequence and a thickening of the surface layer (density\n2.31 g cm\u22123) beneath MAT. This latter is consistent with the higher\nresolution seismic refraction results of Cooper (1993) which demon-\nstrated a north-eastward thickening of the sediment and extrusive\nlayer including the basal group, from 750 to 1.5 km depth over a 12 \u00d7\n12 km2 area in the vicinity of Mathiatis. The difference between the\nseismic and gravity models in the vicinity of MAT may be explained\nby the presence of 3-D effects, the seismic line changing orientation\nin this region from NW\u2013SE to E\u2013W (Fig. 2). In addition surface\ngeology indicates that there is a rotation in the principal direction\nof the geological structure here (Constantinou 1995) such that the\nseismic line runs parallel to structure as opposed to transecting it.\nThe resolution of the shallow region of the seismic model is poor at\nthe edges of the three deployments where the station spacing is less\ndense and there is low ray coverage (Fig. 7) so the lateral \u2018extension\u2019\nis not inconsistent with the seismic data.\nI N T E R P R E TAT I O N\nBased on drillhole information and surface geology a simple geo-\nlogical interpretation (Fig. 9) of the geophysical models has been\nmade.

The outcropping of this\nlayer to the west of APL also correlates well with surface geol-\nogy and it is probable that the lower than average velocities in this\nregion are a result of more extensive weathering and lower over-\nburden pressure resulting in a higher crack density. The velocity\nof this layer correlates well with the results from short refraction\nprofiles (Lort & Matthews 1972), with the exception of one very\nlow value from the short profile survey. The velocity and density of\nthis layer also correlate well with values of 4.63\u20134.82 km s\u22121 for\nthe sheeted dykes obtained from CY-1, 1a and CY-2, 2a (Smith &\nVine 1987, 1991). CY-4 sampled the lower part of the sheeted dyke\ncomplex (Smith & Vine 1989) and compressional wave velocities\nincreased from approximately 5.4 km s\u22121 at the top of the drill hole to\n6.8 km s\u22121 at the base of the sheeted dykes (Salisbury et al. 1989)\nwith a mean of 6.50 km s\u22121 (Smith & Vine 1989). The sheeted dykes\nand the underlying gabbro in CY-4 are less pervasively metamor-\nphosed than dykes exposed in other areas of the ophiolite (e.g. Bickle\net al. 1998) and it is possible that the lower extent of hydrothermal\nalteration has led to the higher average velocity for this unit in CY-4\nthan throughout the rest of the ophiolite. This is further discussed\nbelow.\nBetween SKO and MIT the sheeted dyke layer averages \u223c800 m\nthickness with an average velocity of 5.0 km s\u22121 making it compara-\nble to the second layer of Khan et al. (1972). The boundary between\nthe lavas and sheeted dykes is defined primarily by seismic diving\nwaves and does not preclude the presence of the gradational basal\nlayer above the sheeted dyke complex.\nSeveral large (up to \u223c500 m) offsets modelled in these upper\nlayers, some extending into the layer beneath the sheeted dykes,\nare interpreted as faults. These are all apparently downthrown to\nthe west, and are interpreted as syn-volcanic growth faults based\non evidence for a relatively smooth lava - sediment interface across\nthe ophiolite, and the apparent thickening of the lava sequence to-\nwards them (Fig. 9). These faults are approximately evenly spaced\nwith separations ranging from 5.6 to 8.4 km perhaps suggesting a\nsystematic control on when a new major fault nucleates.

This corresponds closely in both location and interpreted\nthrow with the the fault identified in the seismic data near ATS.\nLikewise, Taylor (1983) mapped a major syn-volcanic growth fault\nnear Politiko (POL) with a throw of 600\u2013800 m dropping down-to-\nthe-west. The basin formed here was filled by volcanics leading to\na smooth lava-sediment interface (fig. 3.21 in Taylor 1983). While\nwe have not identified a direct correlation between the other mod-\nelled faults and those on the ground, the presence for example of\n\u2018a 100-m-wide breccia zone that projects northwards\u2014toward the\nlarge Agrokipia and Kokkinoyia massive sulfide mines\u2019 (Varga &\nMoores 1985) is consistent with the location of the fault we interpret\nas lying beneath the AGR shotpoint.\nGabbroic layer\nThe 3\u20136 km thick layer beneath the sheeted dykes, with velocity\n6\u20136.7 km s\u22121 and density 2.9 g cm\u22123, is interpreted as comprising\ngabbroic rocks, probably including ultramafic plutonics. The rela-\ntively low velocity of this layer beneath KAM may be the result of\nincreased fracturing in this area occurring during the recent uplift\nof Mt Olympus. Between SKO and MIT the velocity and thick-\nness of this layer is comparable to that determined for layer 3 by\nKhan et al. (1972). The velocity of this layer is significantly larger\nthan that derived by Lort & Matthews (1972) for gabbroic rocks\n(5.5 km s\u22121); however, they suggest that their results are \u2018surpris-\ningly low\u2019 and may result from both increased porosity and the rocks\nnot being water saturated owing to their being at the surface.\nUltramafic or serpentinite layer\nThe base of the gabbroic rocks at 4\u20138 km depth from west to east\nis underlain by a very thick (6 km) layer of VP > 7 km s\u22121 with\na density of 3.0 g cm\u22123. This basal layer may be partially serpen-\ntinized peridotite or ultramafic cumulates or fresh peridotite includ-\ning some mafic intrusions. If it is serpentinized peridotite then both\nthe velocity and density would be consistent with ca. 40 per cent ser-\npentinization, similar to the extent of serpentinization of the mantle\nsection of the ophiolite (Wilson 1959; George 1978); this does not\ninclude the serpentinite diapir which is genetically unrelated to the\nophiolite (Robertson 1998; Batanova & Sobolev 2000).\nBase of the model\nThe seismic model is almost completely unconstrained beyond ei-\nther end of the ophiolite complex. However, we have modelled re-\nflections at a depth of \u223c16 km to the west of the ophiolite, and\n\u223c18 km beneath the eastern sediments. Beneath the western end\nof the ophiolite itself, an unreversed velocity of 8.0 km s\u22121 might\nsuggest that \u2018normal\u2019 mantle underlies the postulated serpentinized\nperidotite or ultramafic cumulate layer, but again, this is very poorly\nconstrained. If the material beneath the deepest reflections is \u2018nor-\nmal\u2019 mantle, then this is significantly different from the model of\nMakris et al. (1983) who proposed continental crust above a Moho\nat 35 km depth beneath the Polis graben, and that of Ergu\u00a8n et al.\n(2005) who similarly proposed continental crust, but here above a\nMoho at \u223c20 km depth beneath the exposed Troodos ophiolite.

At this depth the reflection could originate from\nthe northward dipping slab arising from the subduction of the Sinai\nmicroplate beneath Cyprus (e.g. Mascle et al. 2000). The existence\nof this slab is also suggested by regional gravity modelling (Ergu\u00a8n\net al. 2005). The exact depth to this reflector is uncertain, being\nderived from an unreversed seismic traveltime section.\nD I S C U S S I O N\n(1) Comparison between the Troodos seismic model and seismic\nmodels of oceanic crust\nThe Troodos ophiolite has played a pivotal role in the develop-\nment of concepts concerning the processes of sea-floor spreading\n(e.g. Robertson & Xenophontos 1993). However, comparison be-\ntween our model parameter values (velocities and densities), and\nthose of modern oceanic crust, suggests differences between the\nTroodos ophiolite and oceanic crust that need to be explained. That\nsaid, it should be emphasized that the structural interpretation con-\ncerning the presence of syn-volcanic growth faults observed to off-\nset the sheeted dyke gabbro boundary and the lava\u2014SDC boundary,\ndepends primarily on the distribution of velocity values themselves,\nrather than their interpretation in terms of lithologies.\nIt is now generally accepted that beneath the oceanic sediments\n(oceanic seismic layer 1) there is not a simple one-to-one correla-\ntion between the three part ophiolite lithological layering (basalts,\nsheeted dykes, gabbros) and the equivalent oceanic two-layer seis-\nmic velocity structure of layer 2 (being on average 2 km thick with\nvelocities increasing from 3 to 4 km s\u22121 at the top to >6.5 km s\u22121\nat the base) above layer 3 (with velocities commonly in the range\n6.7\u20137.0 km s\u22121) (Carlson & Miller 2004).\nIt is also known that seismic velocities are scale dependent, being\naffected by the variable distribution of porosity and alteration at\ncore sample, borehole and crustal seismic survey scale. Not only\nthis, but seismic velocity in the oceanic crust, which is known to be\nanisotropic (e.g. White & Whitmarsh 1984; Swift & Stephen 1989),\nhas also been shown to contain horizontal gradients (e.g. of >2 s\u22121\nin the upper crust over a scale of 1\u20132 km) comparable to its vertical\ngradients (e.g. Stephen 1988).\nThe methodology used here (interpreting the arrival times of re-\nfracted and reflected seismic rays derived from a relatively poorly\nsampled profile of irregularly distributed shots and recorders over\nsevere topography and highly weathered surface material) results in\na simple layered model with a limited range of velocities derived\nfor each layer. Accepting that the values derived from borehole and\nlaboratory sample may be significantly different as outlined above,\nthere is also the likelihood of values derived from crustal scale seis-\nmic surveys also being different. Carlson (1998) has described the\nvarious experimental procedures used to derive crustal scale velocity\nmodels of the oceanic crust. In general the redundancy of data, the\nregularity of source and receiver spacings, the uniformity of sources\nused, as well as the uniformity of near surface conditions enable the\nuse of processing and interpretation methods which provide crustal\nmodels involving continuously increasing velocity functions with\ndepth. These better reflect the continuous variation, for example\nfrom extrusives to sheeted dykes which is known to exist, than the\napparent distinct uniform layering for each of these units, as derived\nin our model.\nBecause of these difficulties, our model which defines the de-\nrived seismic velocities in terms of Troodos ophiolite lithologies by\ncomparison with surface outcrop and borehole log and sample corre-\nlation, cannot be easily related directly to oceanic crustal velocities,\nbut a number of points can be made.\nFirst, given the limitations identified above, there is good corre-\nlation between our modelled velocities for the sediments and lavas\nand those derived for oceanic crust (Table 5).\nSecondly, the correlation with the velocity values derived from\nsheeted dykes in holes CY-1, 1a (Smith & Vine 1991) and 2 (Smith &\nVine 1987) which are closest to our profile, and our values obtained\nover outcropping sheeted dykes at the western end of the profile,\nsuggest these correlations are robust. However, comparison of our\nresults with those of normal oceanic crust (e.g. Carlson & Herrick\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 167, 1385\u20131401\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n1398 G. D.

A\nnumber of factors may explain this discrepancy:\n(i) One reason for the low value of the velocity in the sheeted\ndykes derived from our study is likely to be the significant tectonic\ndisturbance suffered by the dykes on Troodos, both as a result of\ninitial sea-floor spreading processes in this supra-subduction zone\nenvironment, and also the updoming which resulted in the emer-\ngence of the plutonic sequence at the heart of Troodos within the\nlast 2 Myr. This has resulted in the complex being dissected by frac-\ntures and faults at a wide variety of scales, which will reduce the\nseismic velocity in relation to that of pristine, undeformed oceanic\ncrust.\n(ii) As discussed in relation to the high velocity values obtained\nfor the sheeted dykes in CY-4, the dykes of the Troodos ophio-\nlite are substantially more hydrothermally altered than those of the\nmodern ocean floor (e.g. at Hole 504B) which may have reduced\ntheir velocity. The formation of hydrous secondary minerals, and\nincreases in porosity related to metamorphic reactions, can lower\nthe compressional wave velocity (Christensen et al. 1989).\n(iii) Swift et al. (1998) examined seismic anisotropy within Hole\n504B comparing (vertical) velocities derived from Vertical Seismic\nProfiles (VSP) and (horizontal) velocities derived from Offset Seis-\nmic Profiles (OSP). They conclude that the vertical velocities may\nbe up to 10 per cent higher than the horizontal velocities, which\nis consistent with our velocities (derived from subhorizontal re-\nfracted\/diving waves) for the sheeted dykes being less than those\nidentified in Hole 504B using VSP.\n(iv) The other factor that we should consider is whether the\nsheeted dyke\/gabbro boundary that we have identified can be\nequated to the Layer 2\/3 boundary at all. There have been numerous\nstudies commenting on this correlation. A number of these have\nresulted from study of the compressional wave structure in Hole\n504B (Wilkins & Langseth 1983; Salisbury et al. 1985; Moos et al.\n1986; Christensen et al. 1989; Collins et al. 1989; Detrick et al.\n1994; Swift et al. 1998; Sun & Goldberg 2000), and more recently\nin Hole 1256D (Wilson et al. 2006). The principal result is that fac-\ntors including porosity and alteration are more important than rock\ntype (or grain size) in controlling the boundary between layers 2\nand 3, necessitating caution in accepting exact correlation between\nlithology and the deeper layers of our model. Detrick et al. (1994)\nexamining seismic refraction data suggest that the seismic Layer 2\/3\nboundary lies within the sheeted dyke sequence. Swift et al. (1998)\nusing VSP in Hole 504B produced results implying that seismic\nLayer 2 is composed of the extrusive layer and the transition layer in\nwhich pillows, flows and intrusive dykes intermix. The upper por-\ntion of Layer 3 (velocity \u223c6.1 km s\u22121) is composed of the lower\nsection of sheeted dykes. Wilson et al. (2006) from downhole ve-\nlocity measurements in Hole 1256D identify the layer 2\/3 boundary\nbelow the depth at which gabbro was first encountered. In the light of\nthese observations, while accepting that the ophiolite velocities are\nlow for the reasons outlined above, we suggest it is possible that the\nSDC\/gabbro boundary may lie within the 6.05\u20136.67 km s\u22121 layer,\ndeeper than the modelled reflector we have interpreted as this bound-\nary. However, given the errors associated with our interface depth\nestimates, documented in \u2018Resolution Analysis\u2019 in the Data Mod-\nelling section above, it is unlikely we could resolve the difference\nin depth to the oceanic lithological and seismic layer boundaries.\n(2) Crustal thickness and implications for generation of Troodos\noceanic crust\nThe nature of the basal layer (VP > 7 km s\u22121; 3 g cm\u22123) is critical\nto the interpretation of the thickness of the original supra-subduction\nzone oceanic crust and hence the amount of melt generated. If this\nlayer is comprised largely of serpentinized mantle then the Troo-\ndos crust is only \u223c5 km thick\u2014slightly thinner than average crust\nformed at fast spreading ridges but probably similar to that at some\nslower spreading ridges. This would be somewhat surprising be-\ncause the large amounts of water that must have been added to the\nTroodos mantle (Muenow et al. 1990) should have led to increased\nmelt production over that at mid-ocean ridges and would either re-\nquire a depleted mantle source and\/or inefficient melt generation\nor extraction beneath the ophiolite (e.g. Martinez & Taylor 2002;\nCoogan et al. 2002). Alternatively, if the basal layer is composed\nlargely of ultramafic cumulates, this would indicate that substan-\ntially more melt was generated beneath the Troodos ophiolite than\nat a normal mid-ocean ridge.\nMass balance calculations, based on the composition of the lavas,\ndykes, mafic cumulates and ultramafic cumulates recovered by\ndrilling in the Troodos ophiolite allow us to reconstruct the possi-\nble bulk crustal compositions in either end-member scenario. Using\nthe lava and dyke compositions from CY-1,1a and the mafic and\nultramafic cumulate compositions from CY-4 (Banks 2004) we can\ncompare the composition of the bulk crust for the thick and thin crust\nscenarios. The thick crust has a bulk Mg# of 79.4, MgO of 14.8, CaO\nof 13.3 and Al2O3 of 9.6. The thin crust has an Mg# of 72.9, MgO\nof 11.6, CaO of 11.5 and an Al2O3content of 12.8. Although there\nare uncertainties in the average composition of each layer, which\ndegrade the accuracy of these estimates, the relative differences are\nwell constrained. That said, the thick crust model has an unrealistic\ncomposition with too high a Mg#, too low an Al content, and much\ntoo high a Ca\/Al ratio. This is true even given the uncertainties in\nthe composition of the source, pressure and temperature of melting,\nand uncertainty in the bulk crustal composition. We conclude that\nwithout S wave data to pin down the degree of serpentinization, it\nis not possible to unambiguously distinguish the nature of the basal\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 167, 1385\u20131401\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nCrustal architecture of the Troodos ophiolite 1399\nlayer. However, we favour a serpentinized mantle, or mixed mantle\nand mafic cumulates, origin for this layer\n(3) Nature of the material underlying the basal layer (VP > 7.0\nkm s\u22121)\nIt is not possible from our model to define the nature of the ma-\nterial underlying the basal layer of velocity >7.0 km s\u22121. However,\nwe speculate that it is mantle peridotite. This is consistent with the\nobservation of an unreversed velocity of 8.0 km s\u22121 identified at the\nwestern end of the IANGASS profile beneath shotpoint APL. While\nthis is obviously inadequate proof, our model and interpretation is\nconsistent with that of Shelton (1993). In addition, petrological con-\nstraints support such a hypothesis. The Mount Olympus serpentinite\nis compositionally distinct from mantle peridotite underlying the\nophiolitic crust (Batanova & Sobolev 2000). The latter had a large\namount of basaltic melt extracted from it during the formation of\nthe Troodos ophiolite and is only \u223c40 per cent serpentinized. The\nMount Olympus serpentinite is not simply related to the ophiolite,\nrather it is believed to result from fluids from the subducting slab\nserpentinizing the overlying mantle (Robertson 1998). This serpen-\ntinized peridotite has risen diapirically to the surface within the last\nfew Myrs. Two arguments suggest that this serpentinite diapir has\nnot penetrated through continental crust on its way to the surface.\nFirst, the diapiric serpentinite body would not have had sufficient\ndensity contrast to rise through continental crust. Secondly, it would\nbe expected to entrain continental crustal material for which there\nis no evidence.\nThe discrepancy between this hypothesis and the results of Makris\net al. (1983) needs to be explained. They predict 35 km thick con-\ntinental crust beneath western Cyprus (including the Polis graben).\nBeneath the Polis graben our seismic model is extremely poorly\nconstrained and a significant underestimate of the crustal thickness\nbeneath this part of our model is possible. Given that this region is\nalso at the end of the seismic profile of Makris et al. (1983) it is\nalso not unreasonable to expect that their model may also be poorly\nconstrained in this region.\nThe Makris et al. (1983) model was used to help build the intial\nmodel of Ergu\u00a8n et al. (2005) who predict a \u223c20 km thick continental\ncrust beneath the western part of the exposed ophiolite. This crustal\nthickness of \u223c20 km derived from gravity modelling occurs over\nTroodos itself, assumes a mantle density of 3.38 g cm\u22123 (as used\nby Makris et al. 1983). However, serpentinized mantle has a lower\ndensity and, based on the recent diapiric upwelling of serpentinized\nperidotite to form Mt Olympus, it seems likely that much of the\nmantle beneath Cyprus may be partially serpentinized by fluids from\nthe subducting slab (see e.g. Hyndman & Peacock 2003). Based\non this we have used a lower density for the mantle whereas the\nmantle beneath Makris et al\u2019s (1983) profile is less serpentinized and\ntherefore of higher density, consistent with an equivalent Bouguer\nAnomaly being modelled with their very much thicker, but lower\ndensity, continental crust.\n(4) Implications for models of crustal tectonism in the Troodos\nophiolite\nTwo types of model for tectonic extension in the Troodos ophiolite\nhave been proposed which are as follows.\n(a) The earlier models, based on the orientations of dykes within\nthe sheeted dyke complex, suggested three graben structures al-\nthough the origin of the grabens has been controversial (Varga &\nMoores 1985; Allerton & Vine 1987). Varga & Moores (1985) pro-\nposed that there are three fossil ridge-axis grabens preserved within\nthe Troodos ophiolite that record the eastward stepping of the spread-\ning axis. The western-most, Solea graben, is the most extensively\nstudied. The geophysical models derived here (Figs 5, 8 and 9),\nprovide evidence for a large fault offsetting the lava\/dyke boundary\nbeneath ATS on the eastern side of the proposed graben. However,\nwhile a fault may be interpreted beneath APL on the western side\nof the graben, which correlates with the location of the down-to-\nthe-east Troodos Forest fault mapped by Hurst et al. (1994), the\nmodels provide less evidence that this is a major graben-bounding\nfault. The central, or Mitsero graben between AYI and POL, should\nbe well constrained by the seismic line but there is no evidence for\nthis feature in the data. The eastern, Larnaca graben between LYM\nand AVD, should also be relatively well constrained by the data,\nbut once again, there is no evidence for this in the seismic model.\nCooper (1993) suggests that the northern margin of the ophiolite in\nthe vicinity of Mathiatis is downfaulted beneath the overlying sed-\niments, occurring as a result of N\u2013S directed emplacement. While\nthe strike of our seismic profile subparallels the strike of the pro-\nposed faults in this region, their lack of expression in our seismic\ndata would suggest that they are not the cause of the large faults\noffsetting the extrusive\u2014SDC and SDC\u2014gabbroic layer horizons\nin our final model (Fig. 9).\n(b) Agar & Klitgord (1995) proposed an alternative to the\ngraben model for tectonic extension within the Troodos ophiolite.\nThey suggested that deformation is decoupled between the sheeted\ndyke complex and the plutonic complex leading to different kine-\nmatic histories for these units. However, they also suggest that major\nfaults, dipping towards the ridge axis, cut this boundary as observed\nin the seismic and gravity models. Because the resolution of the geo-\nphysical models is insufficient to identify a thin decoupling zone be-\ntween the sheeted dykes and the plutonic complex, the seismic and\ngravity data cannot test this model directly. However, Agar & Klit-\ngord (1995) propose a spreading centre to the east of the ophiolite\nbased on the structures they observed. This contrasts with the down-\nto-the-west faults interpreted from our results that suggest a spread-\ning centre to the west of the ophiolite. Such a model would be consis-\ntent with the dyke chilling statistics of Kidd & Cann (1974) and Bara-\ngar et al. (1990) and microfossil ages (Osozawa & Okamura 1993).\nIn contrast to these existing models the seismic data is most read-\nily interpreted by a model in which major normal faults, down-\nthrown towards the ridge axis, formed at regular intervals. These\nfaults must have formed close enough to the ridge axis that either\nlong lava flows, or off-axis volcanism, could fill the developing\nhalf-graben. These faults remained active for an extended period,\naccumulating throws of up to 500 m, before deformation jumped to\na new fault closer to the ridge axis.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nVelocity and density modelling of the Troodos ophiolite complex\nhas been completed using the seismic and gravity data sets acquired\nduring the IANGASS 1995 geophysical project. The results of this\nmodelling are as follows.\n(i) A five layer structure is modelled. The velocities and densities\nof the upper layers are consistent with measured borehole properties\nof the sediments, pillow lavas, sheeted dykes and a gabbroic layer.\nAlthough the modelled velocities are in general lower than the equiv-\nalent velocities from oceanic crust there are a number of factors that\nmay account for this. While we are unable unambiguously to define\nthe composition of the thick basal layer underlying the gabbroic base\nof the ophiolite, owing to the lack of discriminatory S-wave data,\nfrom mass balance calculations we favour a serpentinized mantle or\nmixed mantle and cumulate origin for this layer.\n(ii) Several major normal faults downthrown to the west are in-\nterpreted from the model. These faults have throws of \u223c500 m\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 167, 1385\u20131401\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n1400 G. D. Mackenzie et al.\noffseting both the lava\/dyke and dyke\/gabbro boundaries and are\ninterpreted to be syn-volcanic growth faults. No evidence is found\nfor the existence of the previously proposed spreading centres at\nLarnaca and Mitsero. While the resolution of the models cannot\nexclude the existence of the Solea graben they do not appear to in-\ndicate a major bounding fault on the western side of the proposed\ngraben. We propose that the geophysical data support a tectonic\nmodel incorporating a single spreading centre to the west of the\nophiolite.\n(iii) A deep reflector is imaged at \u223c55 km depth beneath the\nophiolite. This may originate from the northward subduction of the\nSinai microplate beneath Cyprus.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThe IANGASS 1995 survey was undertaken with funding and sup-\nport from the Department of Geology, University of Leicester, the\nGeological Survey Department of Cyprus and the Hellenic Mining\ncompany, Cyprus.
