We present simultaneous riometer observations\nof cosmic noise absorption in the nightside and dawn-noon\nsectors during sawtooth particle injections during 18 April\n2002. Energetic electron precipitation (>30 keV) is a fea-\nture of magnetospheric substorms and cosmic radio noise\nabsorption acts as a proxy for qualitatively measuring this\nprecipitation. This event provides an opportunity to com-\npare the absorption that accompanies periodic electron injec-\ntions with the accepted paradigm of substorm-related absorp-\ntion. We consider whether the absorption is consistent with\nthe premise that these injections are quasi-periodic substorms\nand study the effects of sustained activity on the level of pre-\ncipitation. Four consecutive electron injection events have\nbeen identified from the LANL (Los Alamos National Labo-\nratory) geosynchronous data; the first two showing that addi-\ntional activity can occur within the 2\u20134 h sawtooth periodic-\nity. The first three events have accompanying absorption on\nthe nightside that demonstrate good agreement with the ex-\npected pattern of substorm-absorption: discrete spike events\nwith poleward motion at the onset followed by equatorward\nmoving structures and more diffuse absorption, correlated\nwith optical observations. Dayside absorption is linked to\ngradient-curvature drifting electrons observed at geostation-\nary orbit and it is shown that low fluxes can lead to a lack\nof absorption as precipitation is suppressed; precipitation be-\ngins when the drifting electron flux surpasses some critical\nlevel following continuous injections of electrons from the\nmagnetotail. In addition it is shown that the apparent mo-\ntion of absorption determined from an azimuthal chain of ri-\nometers exhibits an acceleration that may be indicative of an\nenergisation of the drifting electron population.\nCorrespondence to: A.

Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (Energetic particles, precipitating; Storms\nand substorms)\n1 Introduction\nDuring some geomagnetic storms geosynchronous satellites\nobserve quasi-periodic changes in energetic particle fluxes\n(particularly protons but also electrons); these take the form\nof sharp increases followed by gradual decays observed\nacross large local time ranges. The overall profile is a well\ndefined \u201csawtooth\u201d composed of particle injections occurring\nevery 2\u20134 h (e.g. Borovsky et al., 2001; Henderson et al.,\n2002; Skoug et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2003a). These vari-\nations occur at the same time as increased emissions from\nenergetic neutral atoms in the inner magnetosphere, confirm-\ning the sawtooth signature as multiple ion and electron in-\njections (Reeves et al., 2003) rather than some local effect\nat the satellite. The sawtooth is associated with stretching\nand dipolarisation of the magnetic field and displays sim-\nilar characteristics to periodic substorms (e.g. Borovsky et\nal., 1993; Belian et al., 1995) and in the past individual teeth\nhave been studied as substorms (Henderson, 2004). Huang et\nal. (2003a) used observations from three geomagnetic storms\nto show that continuous energy transfer to the magnetosphere\nis necessary to maintain sawtooth behaviour. They suggested\nthat solar wind pressure oscillations excite a magnetospheric\nresonant state, which triggers substorms at the resonant fre-\nquency without the need for subsequent external triggers.\nA number of authors have used riometer (Little and lien-\nbach, 1959) chains to provide a global picture of energetic\nelectron precipitation related to substorms (Hargreaves et al.,\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1200 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: Energetic electron precipitation during sawtooth injections\n1975, 1997, 2001; Pytte el al., 1976; Ranta et al., 1981;\nRanta et al., 1999). Riometers provide a simple means of\nmonitoring the precipitation of energetic electrons (energy\ngreater than \u223c30 keV) via measurements of the cosmic ra-\ndio noise absorption (CNA), which has been recognised as\na substorm phenomenon (Akasofu, 1968). CNA manifests\nin various time-dependent structures during the phases of a\nsubstorm both on the night and dayside. During the growth\nphase an equatorward drifting arc forms (Hargreaves et al.,\n1975; Ranta et al., 1981); this can contain pulsating forms\n(Ranta et al., 1999) and is linked to optical arcs (e.g. Jus-\nsila et al., 2004). At the expansion phase onset the region\nof CNA expands both poleward and equatorward, usually in\nthe close to but pre-midnight sector. The change in propaga-\ntion character occurs close to \u223c65\u25e6 magnetic latitude (Jelly,\n1970). The poleward propagating CNA front tends to be a\nsharp enhancement whilst appearing more gradual at lower\nlatitudes. Following onset the riometer absorption is usually\nhighly correlated with near-equatorial >30 keV electron flux\n(Baker et al., 1981) indicating that the CNA is a result of\nstrong pitch angle diffusion in the electron population that is\nfreshly injected from the magnetotail.\nSmall scale structure also appears following the onset of\nthe expansion phase, particularly the spike-event. Lasting 1\u2013\n2 min in duration spikes appear at the poleward edge of the\nsurge and were thought to be caused by the motion of an\nelongated 10\u201350 km thick ribbon of absorption (e.g. Neilsen\nand Axford, 1977). Observations with imaging riometers\nhave shown that the spike event is actually localised in nature\nwith typical dimensions of 190\u00d780 (167\u00d774) km at L\u223c6\n(\u223c13) (Hargreaves et al., 1997). The spikes typically dis-\nplay a poleward motion at the start of an event with speeds\nfrom hundreds to thousands of ms\u22121. There is also usually\nan associated east or westward motion, the latter being more\nprevalent (Spanswick et al., 2005). Stauning (1996) iden-\ntified a number (6\u20138 per hour) of localised discrete events\nwhich included some equatorward moving forms. The spike\nevent also displays fine structure similar to magnetic Pi pul-\nsations suggesting a common source region for the modula-\ntion (e.g. Hargreaves et al., 2001; Aminaei et al., 2006).\nAs well as the north and southward motion the back-\nground CNA displays azimuthal propagation (e.g. Harg-\nreaves, 1968). It is probable that this is linked with the\nmotion of the injection region, but also the electrons will\ngradient-curvature drift eastward towards dawn (e.g. Ka-\nvanagh et al., 2002, and references therein). The elec-\ntrons are quasi-trapped and experience pitch-angle scattering\nthrough whistler mode wave interactions (e.g. Kennel and\nPetschek, 1966) such that post midnight the CNA tends to\nbe more diffuse and is less well correlated with optical mea-\nsurements (e.g. Ansari, 1964). The eastward drift results in\na day-side signature that has been termed slowly varying ab-\nsorption (e.g. Hargreaves and Berry, 1976; Hargreaves and\nDevlin, 1990; Stauning, 1996; Nishino et al., 1999); how-\never the slow-varying nature is often replaced by small scale\nspatial and temporal changes including quasi-periodicities of\n10s of minutes and occasionally displays modulation from\ngeomagnetic pulsations such as field line resonances (e.g. Se-\nnior and Honary, 2003, and references therein).\nA sawtooth event occurred on 18 April 2002; these injec-\ntions have previously been presented by a number of authors\n(e.g. Huang et al., 2003b; Lui et al., 2004; Clauer et al., 2006;\nHenderson et al., 2006) and have been identified as periodic\nsubstorms (mean recurrence time = 2.7 h), with accompa-\nnying phenomena in the magnetotail, inner magnetosphere\nand in ground magnetometer data. This study focuses on\nthe energetic precipitation signature and considers the data in\nthe context of past riometer observations of substorms. An\noverview of the whole event is provided with particular con-\nsideration of three of the identified \u201cteeth\u201d. Observations of\nCNA show overall agreement with the recognised features of\nsubstorm absorption though some unusual effects are high-\nlighted and explained in terms of the effects of sustained ge-\nomagnetic activity on the electron population.\n2 Instrumentation\nObservations of the precipitation of energetic electrons dur-\ning this sawtooth event have been provided by selected sta-\ntions of the Global Riometer Array (GLORIA) in Canada and\nFinland. Riometers measure the absorption of cosmic radio\nnoise produced by increased electron concentration in the D\nregion of the ionosphere, caused by precipitating electrons\nwith energy in excess of about 30 keV. Since these instru-\nments only observe the height-integrated absorption no di-\nrect information on the precipitation spectrum can be ascer-\ntained, and consequently the riometers give only a qualitative\nmeasure of the level of precipitation. Figure 1a shows the ge-\nographic locations of the riometers used in this study. Cana-\ndian data is supplied from what was the CANOPUS project\n(Rostocker et al., 1995); each of the stations is equipped\nwith a broad beam (\u223c60\u25e6), 30 MHz riometer (pointing to\nthe zenith) as well as a 3-component fluxgate magnetome-\nter, which provide data at 5 s resolution. The riometer data\nfrom Finland have been supplied by a chain of widebeam\nriometers, operated by Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory\n(SGO), and from a widebeam instrument co-located with the\nImaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS), operated\nby Lancaster University (UK) (Browne et al., 1995). IRIS\ndata is taken at 1-s resolution but has been averaged to 5 s\nhere and the SGO chain provides data at 1-min resolution.\nThe data from those riometers that do not operate at 30 MHz\nhave been corrected using the simplified assumption that the\nCNA is inversely proportional to the square of the operat-\ning frequency (e.g. Hargreaves, 1969). Table 1 provides a\ncomplete list of the riometers stations and their AACGM (al-\ntitude adjusted corrected geomagnetic) coordinates (Baker\nand Wing, 1989). The two sets of riometers are separated\nby approximately 9 h of magnetic local time (MLT) with the\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1199\u20131214, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1199\/2007\/\nA. J.

The SOPA (Synchronous Orbit Particle An-\nalyzer) instrument, on board the LANL (Los Alamos Na-\ntional Laboratory) geostationary satellites, measures elec-\ntron fluxes from 50\u201326 000 keV; in this paper only the seven\nlower energy channels (50\u2013315 keV) are used. The fluxes\nare spin averaged (1 min values) and provide clear indica-\ntions of when electron injections occur at geostationary or-\nbit. Magnetic field measurements have been provided by two\nof the Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites\n(GOES-8 and GOES-10), which carry twin-fluxgate magne-\ntometers (Singer et al., 1996). The measurements have been\ntransformed into GSM (Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric)\ncoordinates (Russell, 1971) and we have calculated the in-\nclination of the magnetic field relative to the GSM equato-\nrial plane.

The energy channels are 50\u201375 keV (blue), 75\u2013\n105 keV (green), 105\u2013150 keV (red), 150\u2013225 keV (cyan) and 225\u2013\n315 keV (magenta).\nnetic field (MAG) and solar wind (SWEPAM) instruments\n(Smith et al., 1998; McComas et al., 1998); the data have\nbeen time-shifted to the bowshock using a minimum vari-\nance analysis technique based upon the work of Weimer et\nal. (2003). The top two panels (a\u2013b) display the IMF BY and\nBZ components respectively; BY was predominantly west-\nward throughout the day except for an hour after midnight\nand BZ was mostly negative (southward), moving gradually\nnorthward as the day progressed. Panel (c) shows the solar\nwind velocity, which generally slows as the day progresses.\nProton density (d) drops from 14.4 to 0.9 cm\u22123 by 05:50 UT,\nfluctuating between 0.5 and 4 cm\u22123 thereafter, resulting in\ndynamic pressure values of less than 1.5 nPa after 03:10 UT.\nFigure 3 shows the electron fluxes from the six LANL\nsatellites that were operating during the storm. No data were\navailable for LANL-97A and 1994-84 before 04:25 UT; how-\never, as many as nine injections were observed in the electron\nmeasurements when all satellites are considered. Decreases\nin the electron flux are followed by sharp increases resulting\nin the \u201csawtooth\u201d profile. Dispersion in energy (e.g. 1990-\n095 at 12:00 UT) indicates that the observing satellite is out-\nside of the injection region and electrons gradient-curvature\ndrift into the field of view.\nAnn.

The high geomagnetic activity on this day, caused\nby the prolonged southward (IMF), led to a maximum (peak\n= 9.6 dB) in the absorption oval close to Pinawa, (60.59\u25e6 N)\nwith a daily mean absorption of 1.5 dB compared with 0.6 dB\n(peak = 5.2 dB) at Island Lake, the next highest. In Fig. 4b\nthe data from the Finnish riometers are displayed; in this sec-\ntor absorption maximizes close to 63.6\u25e6 N (Rovaniemi: mean\n= 1 dB, peak = 8.6 dB). Some absorption spikes, correspond-\ning to later injections, can be seen later in the day as the\nriometers approach local midnight. The relative weakness of\nthe response in comparison with the Canadian riometers is\nreadily explained if one examines the LANL data presented\nin Fig. 3; note that the flux increases associated with each\ninjection post 16:00 UT are much smaller than the earlier in-\njections.\nFor this study only three of the \u201cteeth\u201d are considered (be-\ntween 02:00 and 10:00 UT) to provide optimum configura-\ntion of the riometers. The CANOPUS instruments were in\nthe night sector where they are most likely to respond to di-\nrect substorm precipitation, and the Lancaster\/SGO riome-\nters are in the morning sector (from dawn to noon) where\ndayside absorption tends to maximise (e.g. Kavanagh et al.,\n2004). In this section we present the observations related to\neach injection before discussing the implications of the day\nand night observations separately in Sect. 4 (Discussion).\n3.2 Injection A: \u223c03:22 UT\nFigure 5 shows the selected injections during 18 April 2002.\nThe top two panels display electron fluxes from the 1990-095\nand 1991-080 spacecraft; the three vertical black lines (A, B\nand C) demonstrate the times of non-dispersed injections ob-\nserved by the two satellites. The third panel shows the angle,\n\u03b8 , between the vertical and horizontal (GSM) magnetic field\ncomponents measured by GOES-8 (blue line) and GOES-10\n(green line); in general lower angles indicate more stretched\nfield configurations. In the bottom panel the absorption from\nthe Gillam riometer is displayed; relative locations of the in-\nstruments can be seen in Fig. 1b.\nThe first marked injection is at 03:22 UT (from 1990-095)\nand occurred with a dipolarization at GOES-8 (1\u03b8=20\u25e6);\nhowever, some forty minutes before the sharp rise in elec-\ntron flux observed by 1990-095 there is a smaller, more vari-\nable flux enhancement (02:40 UT) consisting of four clear\nimpulsive increases. This coincides with a rise in the flux at\n1991-080 and a sharp (1\u03b8=45\u25e6) dipolarization in the mag-\nnetic field at GOES-10, though only a small increase in \u03b8\noccurs at GOES-8. The IMAGE FUV camera also records\nan increase in emission; a V-shaped enhancement of a pre-\nexisting arc structure at the dusk terminator (data not shown).\nThe enhancement is orientated such that there are simultane-\nous brightenings at high and low auroral latitudes. On the\nground Gillam (Fig. 5, bottom panel) shows a sharp enhance-\nment in the CNA close to the time of this injection (\u223c4 min\nlater) followed by further enhancements. This riometer also\nrecords a large spike (\u223c3 dB) above a background of \u223c1 dB\nabsorption, shortly after the injection in the 1990-095 data at\n03:22 UT. Around this time 1991-080 observes a dispersed\nflux signature, probably linked to the previous injection.\nFigure 6 shows data from the Meridian Scanning Pho-\ntometer (MSP) located at Pinawa. The 557.7 nm (a) and\n630.0 nm (b) emissions generally correspond to precipitation\nfrom electrons with energy of a few keV and<1 keV, respec-\ntively. Panels (c) to (e) compare CNA with the emission from\nthe relevant latitudes for Gillam, Island Lake and Pinawa;\nseveral scan positions of the MSP have been averaged to ac-\ncount for the larger field of view of the riometer. The ini-\ntial \u201ctooth\u201d (A) has been split into two and marked, with\ndashed lines A1 and A2, corresponding to the two injections.\nThere is a quiet arc in the optical data which develops into an\nexpansion onset at 02:38 UT expanding both poleward and\nequatorward from Pinawa and the CNA spike moves equa-\ntorward. The absorption and optical signatures have simi-\nlar morphology, suggesting that the electrons producing the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1199\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1199\u20131214, 2007\n1204 A.

The\nthird panel shows the elevation angle, \u03b8 , of the geomagnetic field\nrecorded by the GOES 8 (blue line) and GOES 10 (green line). The\nbottom panel shows the auroral absorption measured by the Gillam\nriometer. The vertical black lines (marked A, B and C) demonstrate\nthe approximate times of particle injections. The dashed, vertical\nblack line notes the position of an additional dipolarization.\nThe evidence suggests that there are actually two injec-\ntions occurring within \u223c40 min. Figure 7 shows the H\ncomponent (northward) of the magnetometer stations in the\nChurchill line (no data were available from Taloyoak) af-\nter subtraction of the daily mean. A negative bay is ob-\nserved by the three most equatorward magnetometers with\na largest change at Pinawa; the downward excursion be-\ngins at 02:38 UT (coincident with the onset of the optical\nbrightening shown in Fig. 6) and reaches \u2212255 nT (from\n400 nT) at 02:57 UT before decreasing further to\u2212410 nT by\n03:12 UT. Following this is a second negative bay observed\nby all of the magnetometers and peaks at Gillam by 03:30 UT\n(from 400 nT to\u2212700 nT). Figure 8 shows CNA recorded by\nthe Fort Smith and Fort McMurray riometers, west of the\nChurchill line. Fort McMurray observes a sharp absorption\nincrease at 02:44 UT which subsequently expands poleward\nto Fort Smith 3 min later. Figure 9 shows the data from the\nazimuthal chain of riometers. There is a small spike at Daw-\nson and a stronger response at Fort Simpson; these data seem\nto indicate a rapid eastward motion of the absorption at the\nsame time as the poleward motion shown in Fig. 8.\nFigure 10 presents the electron flux measured by LANL-\n01A and LANL-02A with the absorption from IRIS and the\nAnn.

These data come from the meridian scanning photometer (MSP), located at Pinawa, on 18 April 2002. The top two panels show the\ntwo emissions: 557.7 nm (a) and 630.0 nm (b). The horizontal black lines in (b) denote the field of view of the 557.7 filter (lower altitude\nemission. The bottom three panels show data from Gillam (c), Island Lake (d) and Pinawa (e); adjacent latitude scans have been averaged to\naccount for the larger beam sizes of the riometers. The three vertical, dashed lines represent the approximate times of the electron injections\n(A1, A2 and B). Reliable data were not available for substorm C.\nSGO chain from 02:30 UT to 10:00 UT. There is a dispersed\nenergy signature at LANL-01A (04:00 MLT) following A1\nbeginning at 02:45 UT, thus the riometers are outside of the\ninjection region. The absorption at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi occurs be-\ntween the peak fluxes at LANL-01A and LANL-02A rather\nthan linked to the leading edge of the flux enhancement.\nThere is an L-shell dispersion at the onset time of the ab-\nsorption, and the CNA at Rovaniemi and Sodankyla\u00a8 is twice\nthe magnitude of that at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (L=6.1).\nA2 has a smaller response in the satellites but the riome-\nters observe an increase in absorption some 11 min after the\ninjection is recorded at 1990-095. This time the absorption is\nnotable at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (\u223c2 dB) but is still significantly higher\nat Rovaniemi on occasions (e.g. at 04:05 UT). This absorp-\ntion decays to background levels by \u223c05:10 UT. Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8\nsees small increases (<1 dB) however the absorption is con-\nsistently low. It is worth noting at this point that the riome-\nters are sensitive to particles that enter the loss cone and\nconsequently precipitate into the ionosphere whereas SOPA\nmeasures electron fluxes at all pitch angles. Consequently,\nalthough similar structure may appear in the LANL and ri-\nometer data, one would only expect a direct correspondence\nif there is strong pitch angle scattering of the electrons (e.g.\nBaker et al., 1981). At other times only a fraction of the elec-\ntron flux (depending on the effectiveness of the scattering\nmechanism) measured by LANL is observed by the riome-\nters.\n3.3 Injection B: 05:40 UT\nInjection B, observed by 1990-095 at \u223c05:40 UT (Fig. 5),\nconsists of a single flux enhancement of similar magnitude\nto the injection at 03:22 UT. Both GOES 8 (05:34 UT) and\nGOES 10 (05:32 UT) record a dipolarization of the mag-\nnetic field. The riometer at Gillam witnesses a 2 dB rise at\napproximately the same time; this increase is smaller than\nthe previous event and there is no easily discernable spike\nevent. In this case the absorption displays a poleward motion\n(Fig. 6) that reflects the expected CNA response to the onset\nof a substorm (Hargreaves, 1974) and is consistent with the\noptical data. The changing ratio of the 557.7 nm emission to\nthe CNA suggests that there is either a hardening of the pre-\ncipitation spectrum as time progresses (Fig. 6) or a change\nin the effectiveness of pitch angle scattering. The similarity\nof the structure suggests that the precipitating electrons are\nfrom the same source population. The magnetometer data\n(Fig. 7) also shows a poleward motion of the negative bay in\nthe H component, starting at \u223c05:30 UT.\nFigure 11 consist of snapshots of the Ultra Violet (UV)\nemission (from IMAGE), taken at 2 min resolution and\nmapped onto a geographical and local time grid.

The tim-\ning makes it extremely unlikely that this increase is directly\nassociated with the injection and none of the other riome-\nters observe an increase immediately following the injection.\nThe LANL satellites (01A and 02A) observe further flux in-\ncreases (beginning at 06:10 UT and 06:15 UT, respectively)\nwhich are dispersed in energy, the timing of which suggests\nthat they are drift echoes of the initial injection (e.g. Reeves\net al., 1990). The flux in the highest plotted energy channel\nof LANL-01A (225\u2013315 keV) peaks first at 06:01 UT and the\npeak in the dispersed signature returns 27 min later. This is\nconsistent with an estimate of the drift period of an equato-\nrially mirroring electron with energy of 256 keV in a dipole\nfield.

There is an absorp-\ntion enhancement at Gillam shortly after 09:05 UT, approx-\nimately an hour after the injection onset. This follows an\nincrease in the flux at geostationary orbit (e.g. 1991-080).\nRiometers west of Gillam observe an increase in absorption\nat progressively earlier times (Fig. 9), though there is a thirty-\nfive minute separation between the onset at Dawson and the\nresponse at Fort Simpson.

In general the storm led to increased ionisation in\nthe D-layer that resulted in enhanced CNA. Figure 4 demon-\nstrates that the absorption is high in both the Canadian and\nFinnish sectors and that the absorption oval has expanded\nin response to the solar-wind\/IMF driving of the magneto-\nsphere. The absorption maximises at lower magnetic lati-\ntudes in Canada than in Finland by approximately 3\u20134 de-\ngrees, in agreement with previous statistical studies of ab-\nsorption (e.g. Hargreaves, 1966, and references therein). A\nloss of absorption occurs at higher latitudes in Finland as the\nevent progresses, somewhat at odds with the findings pre-\nsented by Hargreaves (1968) who determined that increases\nin activity are likely to shift the maximum absorption (which\nincreases) to lower latitudes, but not to reduce the absorp-\ntion at higher latitudes. This is likely true in general when\nthe increased absorption is driven by high solar wind speeds\nand pressure changes, but in this case the motion to lower\nlatitudes is predominantly caused by an enlarged polar cap,\nassociated with a long period of southern IMF BZ .\nThe absorption follows the diurnal pattern highlighted in\nstatistical studies (e.g. Kavanagh et al., 2004, and references\ntherein) such that there is a maximum occurrence of CNA in\nthe morning sector and around midnight but a notable min-\nimum in the afternoon. There is a sustained enhancement\nat Pinawa between 15:00 and 23:00 UT (mean = 1.13 dB)\nwhich is possibly the result of a steady drizzle of radiation\nbelt electrons at L=4, but this is not investigated here.\nAs well as the three main injections (A1, B and C) an-\nother has been identified (A2); this occurs some 40 min after\nA1. The timing of the observations makes it highly unlikely\nthat this is caused by an expansion of the original dipolar\nregion; this would result in a rapid acceleration of the expan-\nsion from 0.05\u25e6 s\u22121 (delay between the GOES spacecraft) to\n0.3\u25e6 s\u22121. It is possible that either A1 or A2 is actually a pseu-\ndobreakup (e.g. Koskinen et al., 1993) although much of the\ndata suggest that they are substorms. It appears that follow-\ning the auroral activation accompanying injection A1 growth\ncontinues away from the region of dipolarization (due to con-\ntinued energy input from the solar wind) leading to a second\ninjection and auroral enhancement (at A2). The break-up\naccompanying A2 starts at higher latitudes; the photometer\n(Fig. 6) and magnetometer (Fig. 7) data shows the auroral\nsignature to begin at Gillam rather than Pinawa. Following\ninjection A1, open magnetic flux is closed, shrinking the po-\nlar cap, and the dayside reconnection rate is insufficient to\nreturn the flux to the pre-substorm level before the next ex-\npansion onset. Huang et al. (2003b) identified injection A1 as\na substorm through observations by GEOTAIL (Kokubun et\nal., 1994) of a travelling compression region related to plas-\nmoid formation in the magnetotail as well as observations of\nproton flux enhancements by 1991-080 (16:00 MLT).\nThese observations suggest that additional and\/or more\ncomplicated activity may occur within the quasi-periodic 2\u2013\n4 h sawtooth timeframe. The cause for this particular devi-\nation may be found in the solar wind conditions at the time\n(Fig. 2); BY was eastward (positive) at 02:48 UT (account-\ning for the delay to Earth) and then turned sharply westward\n(negative) before the second injection (A2); the first injection\n(A1) also corresponded with a rise in the dynamic pressure\n(1 nPa) above an already increased level. Conditions for sub-\nsequent injections were much more stable thus this \u201cdouble\nevent\u201d may have been triggered by the more variable solar\nwind. Changes in the magnetospheric configuration might\nexplain the reduced flux at some of the LANL satellites as\nthe region of densest particle population moved across the\nsatellites.\n4.2 Nightside absorption (Canadian sector)\nMore insight into the dynamics of the particle precipitation\nmay be gleaned from separate analyses of the night and day-\nside absorption signatures of the selected teeth. For the first\n3 injections there are distinct examples of riometer absorp-\ntion related to substorm activity. There is a poleward mov-\ning, weak onset at the Churchill line and a strong, poleward\nmoving enhancement further west (Fig. 8) following injec-\ntion A1. This is followed by equatorward moving enhance-\nments (\u223c10 min after the first) in agreement with the current\nparadigm of auroral absorption during substorms (e.g. Ranta\net al., 1981) that is described in Sect. 1. After 02:45 UT\nthe CNA propagates eastward from a small spike at Dawson\n(Fig. 9) consistent with past observations of the substorm on-\nset in absorption. Thus A1 has some of the general features\nof a \u201cstandard\u201d absorption substorm but whether a growth\nphase absorption bay exists is difficult to assess due to the\nshort timescales between intense activity-onsets. An inter-\nesting aspect to this injection is the structure of the geosyn-\nchronous flux enhancements; the injections are short lived\n(\u223c8 min in duration) and this may be the controlling factor\nbehind the short duration of the CNA enhancements. In this\ncase they would not be spike events in the classical sense\n(e.g. Hargreaves et al., 1997); rather they are the direct pre-\ncipitation of short-lived injection bursts from the tail.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1199\u20131214, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1199\/2007\/\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: Energetic electron precipitation during sawtooth injections 1209\nThe second injection (A2), at \u223c03:20 UT, has a well-\ndefined equatorward moving CNA spike (Fig. 6), which de-\ncreases in magnitude as it moves south. The time differ-\nence between the dipolarization at GOES-8 and the spike at\nGillam is 11 min (separated by 24.48\u25e6 longitude), whereas\nduring A1 it is \u223c5 min from GOES-10 to the first poleward\nmoving spike (11.62\u25e6 separation). Thus there is time for a\npoleward propagating spike event to form outside of the field\nof coverage, possibly poleward and\/or eastward of the riome-\nters. Thus this absorption fits the substorm paradigm as well,\nincluding absorption that correlates well with the diffuse op-\ntical signature (e.g. Ansari, 1964). Westward motion of ab-\nsorption before midnight, as seen in A2 (Fig. 9), is a feature\nof the global pattern of absorption motion defined by Harg-\nreaves (1968). This type of motion shall be investigated with\nrespect to injection B with the additional available diagnos-\ntics but is more a function of the location of the riometers\nwithin the injection region than a local time phenomenon.\nFor the third injection, B, at\u223c05:30 UT there is a poleward\nprogression of a sharp onset (though not a clearly defined\nspike) that begins at Pinawa and is generally well correlated\nwith the optical signature (Fig. 6). The decline in the ratio of\nthe 557.7 nm emission to absorption indicates either that the\nspectrum of precipitation hardens or else the effectiveness of\nthe pitch angle scattering increases. After \u223c06:20 UT the\nslowly varying absorption structure (at Island Lake) suggests\nthat it is related to drifting electrons of higher energy than\nthose responsible for the discrete spikes (second category of\nabsorption from Ansari, 1964).\nThe westward expansion of absorption (Fig. 9) from\n05:40:50 UT to 05:47:25 UT moves with a velocity of\n\u223c0.15\u25e6 s\u22121. It is unlikely that gradient-curvature drifting\nions precipitate with enough intensity to produce the 1\u20132 dB\nabsorption since the apparent motion suggests that the lead-\ning edge of drifting ions would have energy of \u223c150 keV,\nleading to E-region deposition. Figure 13 shows time se-\nries from three pixels of the FUV camera corresponding to\nthe locations of the Dawson, Fort Smith and Gillam riome-\nters. The rise time of the emission (converted to electron\nenergy flux) closely matches the absorption at the three lo-\ncations suggesting that either the low energy electrons are\nmoving with the same drift speed in the magnetosphere as\nthe higher energies or else the precipitation is caused by\nsome form of trigger moving independently of the particle\ndrift speed. The apparent speed of the absorption (corre-\nsponding to\u223c6.6 km s\u22121 in the F region ionosphere) is much\nhigher than the typical convection speeds of a few hundred\nmetres per second and the convection pattern derived from\nAMIE (Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynam-\nics) (Richmond and Kamide, 1988) shows that the westward\nmotion of absorption is within a region of eastward con-\nvection (pattern not shown) Hargreaves (1968) suggests that\na fast mode magneto-sonic wave, propagating azimuthally\nfrom the midnight sector could trigger precipitation of an\nextant population of electrons.

Comparison of cosmic noise absorption with the electron\nenergy flux derived from the FUV emission from closest pixel of\nthe camera following Injection B on 18 April 2002. The stations,\nGillam to Dawson, run east to west, respectively, and show the ap-\nparent westward motion of both the FUV emission and the CNA.\nThe magnetic longitudes are marked on the plots.\ntron flux must be above the critical stable trapping limit (e.g.\nCoroniti and Kennel, 1970) but here, the time between injec-\ntion and precipitation is too short for the electron population\nto have increased following gradient curvature drift. A more\nlikely explanation is that the apparent westward motion rep-\nresents an expansion of the injection region where electrons\nare injected at progressively earlier local times (e.g. Thomsen\net al., 2001).\nObservations during the final injection, C, provide con-\nflicting information of when the onset of the potential sub-\nstorm occurs. The 1991-081 and 1994-084 satellites record\nsharp injection fronts close to 07:57 UT (at\u223c18:00 MLT and\n\u223c21:45 MLT, respectively). The proton fluxes from the satel-\nlites also suggest a pre-08:00 UT injection (data not shown).\nHowever the GOES-10 magnetometer measures a dipolar-\nization at 08:10 UT and the dispersed electron fluxes from\nthe 02A, 01A and 095 spacecraft also suggest an injection\ncloser to 08:10 UT. This later estimate ties in with the ob-\nservations from the GEOTAIL satellite, as described by Lui\net al. (2004), which observes a travelling compression region\n(TCR) related to a plasmoid at 08:15 UT when the spacecraft\nis \u223c26RE down tail; however, since GEOTAIL is in the tail\nlobe at this time (ZGSM=7.6RE) there will be a propagation\ndelay between the passage of the plasmoid and the obser-\nvation of the TCR. Thus connecting the timing of the TCR\nwith the injection at geosynchronous orbit is difficult. The\nFUV camera (Fig. 12) records no enhanced emission at the\ntime of the initial injection but does observe a strong onset at\n08:12 UT; this softer precipitation is predominantly confined\nto the dusk-midnight sector. During an injection the auroral\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1199\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1199\u20131214, 2007\n1210 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: Energetic electron precipitation during sawtooth injections\nprecipitation lies within the injection region but it cannot be\nreliably used as an identifier for the boundary of the injec-\ntion region. In this case it suggests that the dipolarization\nregion is heavily skewed towards dusk and this is reinforced\nby the observations from GOES 8 (at 03:00 MLT), which\nshow no dipolarization at all. The explanation for this dis-\ncrepancy in timing is not clear, although close inspection of\nthe electron flux data from 1991-080 and 1994-084 suggest\nthat the initial rise is followed by a slightly larger increase at\n\u223c08:12 UT. The same is true of the proton flux: a small in-\ncrease at\u223c07:56 UT, which peaks at 08:05 UT, followed by a\ndecline and a second enhancement at 08:10 UT. Therefore it\nappears that there are two separate impulsive injections; the\nfirst is not accompanied by a dipolarization and results in low\nfluxes; the second is a sustained injection after the first rise\nand consists of higher fluxes of electrons. Thus the second in-\njection accompanied an apparent substorm onset as identified\nfrom other signatures, although the dipolarization\/injection\nregion was confined in longitude to the dusk-midnight sec-\ntor.\nMost of the riometers were outside of the asymmetric\ninjection region and consequently observed no absorption\nresponse. The rise in absorption after 08:10 UT suggests\nthat Dawson is within the injection region. The following\neastward expansion of the CNA spreads to Fort Simpson at\n08:52 UT, Fort Smith by 08:59 UT and arrives at Gillam by\n09:06 UT; this represents an apparent acceleration of the av-\nerage absorption motion from 0.01\u25e6 s\u22121 through 0.03\u25e6 s\u22121 to\n0.06\u25e6 s\u22121. Although the instruments are most likely on dif-\nferent drift paths the radial separation cannot explain the tim-\ning of the CNA onset; one would expect a swifter response\nat Fort Smith and a longer delay at Gillam. A duskward elec-\ntric field would lead to energisation of the drifting electrons\nin this time sector leading to an overall increase in the energy\nof electrons most responsible for absorption,. Conserving the\nfirst adiabatic invariant the energy increase is in the longitu-\ndinal direction leading to lower pitch angles and increased\nprecipitation (Pellinen and Heikkila, 1984). This would lead\nto an increase in the gradient-curvature drift speed but should\nalso result in an increase in absorption; the observed reduc-\ntion could be a consequence of the radial distribution in the\nflux of electrons where the flux is highest at the L-shell con-\nnected to Dawson. Alternatively the reduction could be at-\ntributed to either an overall loss of flux at progressively later\nlocal times or a change from strong to weak pitch angle diffu-\nsion. It is currently impossible to determine the exact cause\nwith the available data. However, the absorption structure at\nFort Simpson is similar to that at Dawson but changes con-\nsiderably at the other riometers, indicative of the precipita-\ntion spectrum is changing.\nThe CNA peak at Dawson occurs with a sharp, disper-\nsionless, rise in the electron flux observed by 1991-080 (see\nFig. 5); the total electron flux (50\u2013315 keV) rose by over an\norder of magnitude from 08:15 UT (\u223c\u00d730) to 08:45 UT. The\nnon-dispersed nature of the signature suggests that this is an\nadditional injection of particles rather than a drift echo of the\nprevious injection. Although the sharp rise is not apparent\nin the other spacecraft a small dispersed signature appears\nsome 45 min later at 1990-095 (\u223c\u00d730 flux increase from\n105 to 3.5\u00d7106 at \u223c09:12 UT). This increase seems to trig-\nger the precipitation of drifting electrons that had been stably\ntrapped even after the injection closer to 08:00 UT.\nKennel and Petschek (1966) suggested that in order for\nprecipitation to begin whistler mode wave turbulence must\noccur. This only happens when the flux of electrons on a\nfield line surpasses a critical level. Thus, it would appear that\nthe electron flux injected between L=4 and L=9 is initially\ntoo low to produce precipitation. Ongoing injections raise\nthe level of electron flux and lead to eventual precipitation.\nThe meridional chains of riometers demonstrate a lack of L-\nshell dispersion in agreement with the non-dispersed electron\nflux signature. This places the eastward edge of this injection\nregion between Fort Smith and 1990-095.\n4.3 Dayside absorption (Finnish sector)\nIn the morning sector the first two injections (A1 and A2)\nproduce fairly typical results: Dispersed signatures are ob-\nserved at geostationary orbit by LANL-01A and LANL-02A\nand the CNA displays L-shell dispersion at onset. This is\nconsistent with the effects of gradient-curvature drift, which\npredicts that particles on a higher L-shell should reach a par-\nticular longitude earlier than particles of the same energy at\nlower L-shells (e.g. Kavanagh et al., 2002, and references\ntherein). The spike-like enhancements in CNA in the day-\nside ionosphere are not the same phenomenon as night-side\nspikes related to the substorm onset\/injection. As the precip-\nitation event progresses the L-shell dispersion disappears and\nmuch of the structure appears to be either coincident across\nL-shells or sometimes leading in the equatorward riometers.\nThis may be attributed to the changing dominant energy com-\nbined with continuous injections over large regions of MLT.\nAnother possibility is that some local effect in the magne-\ntosphere is modulating the precipitation, such as interaction\nwith a ULF wave (e.g. Coroniti and Kennel, 1970); this will\nbe the subject of a future paper. It can be inferred from the\nhigher absorption at lower latitudes at this time that either\nhigher electron fluxes were present at lower L shells or else\ngreater pitch angle scattering into the loss cone occurred. It\nis important to note that the flux measurements were made at\nsome distance from the riometer sites (see Table 2) and that\nthe relationship between electron-flux at geostationary orbit\nand riometer data from the dayside ionosphere is complex.\nBaker et al. (1981) demonstrated that the flux-absorption re-\nlationship is heavily dependent on the strength of the pitch-\nangle diffusion, even when the flux is above the Kennel-\nPetschek limit. In addition the LANL satellites provide a\nsnapshot of the flux in the radiation belts at geosynchronous\norbit and so are not directly comparable (in time and struc-\nture) with measurements of CNA away from the footprint.\nAnn.

Kavanagh et al.: Energetic electron precipitation during sawtooth injections 1211\nFor injection B LANL-01A was in the electron injec-\ntion region at 05:40 UT, as evidenced by the dispersion-\nless signature. 1990-095 was also in the injection region\n(Fig. 5) and showed similar timing of injection to LANL-\n01A but with larger flux values; for example the flux of elec-\ntrons between 75 and 105 keV ranged from 5 to 15 times\ngreater at 1990-095 than at LANL-01A. This is either a dif-\nference in the nature of the injection region across MLT or\nelse LANL-01A is connected to a different drift path than\n1990-095 (Table 2 shows that the satellites are on different\ndipole L-shells). An analysis of the dispersed signature at\nLANL-02A places the eastern boundary of the injection at\n\u223c07:00 MLT; therefore the Finnish riometers are close to\nthe injection region (\u223c08:30 MLT) but only the two lowest\nlatitude instruments (Oulu and Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8) observe absorp-\ntion enhancements with a response at 05:55 UT. The lack\nof CNA at the time of the injection is likely related to the\nlow electron flux observed at LANL-01A (1 h of MLT west\nof the riometer site). In this case, although there is injec-\ntion of electrons across a wide range of MLT as indicated\nby the geosynchronous satellites the precipitation region is\nnarrower, confined to the more westward portion of the in-\njection region over Canada. The flux continues to increase at\nLANL-01A such that by 06:00 UT the levels are compara-\nble with those at 1990-095 at the time of the injection. With\nno direct measurement of the injection region available at\nlower latitudes it is difficult to be certain of the cause of the\ndelayed response at Oulu and Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8, however a slow re-\nsponse is expected at lower latitudes where the drift speed is\nlower than at higher L-shells. It is not until 06:24 UT (almost\nan hour after injection) that Kilpisja\u00a8rvi records a response;\nthis is an isolated increase (\u223c1 dB) followed by some weaker\nstructure <0.8 dB. The increased absorption south of Ivalo\n(maximum at Rovaniemi and extending beyond Oulu) oc-\ncurs at a similar time to the drift echo in the LANL-01A data,\nwhich has raised the total flux (50\u2013315 keV) by a factor of 3\nto 1.8\u00d7106 electrons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 since 06:00 UT.\nOf course the LANL satellites are separated from the L-\nshell of Rovaniemi by \u223c1.6RE and the weaker response at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi (1L\u223c0.5RE) suggests that the electron flux is\nsomewhat higher at L=5 than at geostationary orbit. Jelly and\nBrice (1967) found that the fluxes of electrons in the inner\nmagnetosphere following periods of low geomagnetic activ-\nity (\u223c12 h) were insufficient to produce dayside precipitation\neven after injections from small substorms. It seems that the\nsame effect can be produced during periods of sustained ac-\ntivity such as this sawtooth event (average Kp=6 since the\nCME impacts on 17 April 2002) when the loss of electrons\nis increased and precipitation is only triggered once continu-\nous (or secondary) injections have raised the electron flux on\na given drift shell beyond the stable trapping limit (Kennel\nand Petshcek, 1966).\nThe rise-time of absorption when compared to the elec-\ntron flux signatures at the LANL spacecraft suggests that\nit is most associated with electrons of energy in ex-\ncess of 100 keV. The flux of 105\u2013150 keV electrons sur-\npassed 4\u00d7104 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 shortly before the ab-\nsorption increase (at Rovaniemi) peaking at 06:53 UT at\n1.1\u00d7105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121. The peak flux levels at\nLANL-01A during injection A2 are of similar values to this\npeak and notably Kilpisja\u00a8rvi responded to A2 but not B. Ac-\ncording to Kennel and Petschek (1966) the stably trapped\nlimit (for electrons >40 keV) increases as the particles ap-\nproach noon, thus a higher particle flux is required to initiate\nprecipitation.\nThe final injection, C, was heavily confined to the dusk-\nmidnight sector. The 50\u201375 keV electron flux at LANL-\n01A rises by a factor of 4 (to 7\u00d7105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121)\nbetween 08:55 and 09:08 UT. Since absorption increases\nat 09:05 UT this suggests that the injection at 08:12 UT\nwas sufficient to instigate precipitation at the SGO riome-\nters on the dayside and the CNA is predominantly caused\nby electrons greater than 50 keV. The timing of the on-\nset at Gillam and Ivalo is most likely coincidental since\nthe electron flux on the relevant drift path for Gillam only\nreached the critical level following the secondary injection\nat 08:31 UT. Therefore it seems that the electron flux at\nlower L shells (L<5.7) is high enough to trigger precipita-\ntion. The lack of a response at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi is indicative of\nthe lower fluxes at higher L-shells over Finland: for the low-\nest energy channel compare 7\u00d7105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 at\nLANL-01A with 5\u00d7106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 at 1991-080;\nthe pre 08:31 UT flux level at 1991-080 is more comparable\n(2\u00d7105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121).\nThus higher absorption is confined to the ionosphere that is\nlinked to regions of the inner magnetosphere. Consequently,\nit can be inferred that electron fluxes remain high at lower lat-\nitudes (L<5), possibly aided by radial diffusion over the pre-\nceding hours. At higher latitudes many of the drifting elec-\ntrons are being lost, probably through a mixture of precipita-\ntion between Canada and Europe and the open drift paths of\nsome of the electrons, carrying them to the magnetopause.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nObservations of CNA during a quasi-periodic sawtooth event\nhave been presented for the first time. Data have been used\nfrom an extensive network of riometers (GLORIA) that cov-\ners the Canadian and northern European sectors. Night side\nobservations during the first four injections show that the\nsawtooth event is consistent with the expected precipita-\ntion pattern from a series of quasi-periodic substorms. For\nthe first two injections L-shell dispersion of CNA was ob-\nserved on the dayside, consistent with the effects of gradient-\ncurvature drift; this effect disappears such that gradient-\ncurvature drift is no longer the dominant mechanism in\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1199\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1199\u20131214, 2007\n1212 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: Energetic electron precipitation during sawtooth injections\ndetermining the apparent absorption motion. Following the\nlatter two injections CNA is not observed until over an hour\nlater; this is likely caused by the drifting electron flux being\nbelow the stable-trapping limit; continuous or secondary in-\njections add more electrons onto the drift shells such that the\nelectron flux is increased sufficiently to produce precipitation\non the drift echo.\nFollowing the third injection a case of westward moving\nabsorption in the pre-midnight sector has been identified. Al-\nthough this motion is matched by the lower energy precipi-\ntation recorded by FUV the speed of motion rules out E\u00d7B\ndrift as the mechanism. Instead we suggest that it is an az-\nimuthal expansion of the injection region such that the pre-\ncipitation trigger is moving westward and the motion of the\nelectrons in the magnetosphere is still eastward. This may\nexplain other instances of westward motion that have been\nidentified by past authors in the global pattern of absorption\nmotion.\nObservations of CNA following the fourth injection show\nthat the azimuthal motion of absorption across a relatively\nlarge base line varies in speed (in this case it accelerates).\nThis may be caused either by a change in the dominant en-\nergy of precipitation related to the particles that are being\ncontinually injected from the magnetotail or through acceler-\nation of the electron population in the duskward convection\nelectric field. It is impossible to be certain without direct\nmeasurements of the precipitation spectrum even though it\ndoes reinforce past observations of hardening spectra on the\ndayside as absorption events progressed. Therefore large un-\ncertainties and errors will arise when widely spaced riome-\nters are used to estimate the energy or drift speed of the elec-\ntron population that contributes to the precipitation.\nFinally, an important point relating to the sawtooth injec-\ntions should be considered. The first two injections are sep-\narated by \u223c40 min rather than the 2\u20134 h that usually charac-\nterise the sawtooth injections, although this may be an ex-\nample of a single complex response to the continuing en-\nergy input to the magnetosphere within the quasi-periodicity.\nEach signature in the LANL data is accompanied by a dipo-\nlarization in at least one of the GOES satellites and has corre-\nsponding ground signatures suggestive of possible substorm\nactivity. It appears that the growth phase is continuing away\nfrom and after the initial onset resulting in an expansion. The\nshort time separation may be due to triggering by variable so-\nlar wind conditions (IMF BY and dynamic pressure) before\nit settled into the more stable configuration that accompanied\nthe remainder of the injections.\nAcknowledgements.
