We present combined observations made near\nmidnight by the EISCAT radar, all-sky cameras and the\ncombined released and radiation efects satellite (CRRES)\nshortly before and during a substorm. In particular, we\nstudy a discrete, equatorward-drifting auroral arc, seen\nseveral degrees poleward of the onset region. The arc\npasses through the field-aligned beam of the EISCAT\nradar and is seen to be associated with a considerable\nupflow of ionospheric plasma. During the substorm, the\nCRRES satellite observed two major injections, 17 min\napart, the second of which was dominated by O` ions. We\nshow that the observed arc was in a suitable location in\nboth latitude and MLT to have fed O` ions into the\nsecond injection and that the upward flux of ions asso-\nciated with it was sufficient to explain the observed injec-\ntion. We interpret these data as showing that arcs in the\nnightside plasma-sheet boundary layer could be the\nsource of O` ions energised by a dipolarisation of the\nmid- and near-Earth tail, as opposed to ions ejected from\nthe dayside ionosphere in the cleft ion fountain.\n1 Introduction\nA number of authors (e.g. Baker et al., 1982) have dis-\ncussed the possible role of ionospheric O` ions in trigger-\ning substorm onset. The presence of increasing amounts of\nO` in the magnetospheric plasma can increase the growth\nrate of the ion-tearing mode instability, and this instability\nhas been invoked to explain the sudden disruption of the\ncross-tail current prior to substorm onset (Bu\u00a8chner and\nZelenyi, 1987). The concentration of O` in the magneto-\nsphere has also been observed to increase during the early\ngrowth phase of substorms. Daglis et al. (1991), using\nAMPTE-CCE ion data, showed that the partial pressure\nCorrespondence to: N. Gazey\nof all the major ion species, H`, O` and He2`, increases\nduring the stretching of the tail field, but that while H`\nremains the dominant ion of the three, the largest relative\nincrease in pressure is seen in O`. A further study by\nDaglis et al. (1994) showed the excellent correlation be-\ntween O` energy density and AE, and in particular be-\ntween O` energy density and AU, which increases in the\ngrowth phase, prior to onset. Given the almost complete\nabsence of O` from the solar wind (Bame et al., 1970;\nPrange, 1978; Johnson, 1979), the ionosphere must be\nactive in feeding the magnetosphere during the growth\nphase. Since auroral electron precipitation and in particu-\nlar auroral arcs are associated with upward beams of O`\nions (Shelley et al., 1982), auroral arcs provide one means\nof populating the near-Earth plasma sheet with O`.\nIonospheric O` ions flow into the magnetosphere as\nbeams (the result of field-parallel acceleration) or conics\n(due to transverse acceleration). Beams are associated\nmainly with outward field-aligned currents. Some beams\nare composed entirely of O` and some entirely of H`\n(Kintner et al., 1979). According to Frank et al. (1977),\na flux of 1012 m~2 s~1 of O` must leave the topside\nauroral ionosphere to explain fluxes of O` observed at\n35R\nE\n, an estimate which is consistent with observations of\noutflow (with energies E\u20195 eV) made by the ISIS-2\nspacecraft below 1 R\nE\n(Klumpar, 1979). Auroral oxygen-\nion outflow is most profuse at low energies (0\u2014100 eV), as\ndemonstrated by observations of thermal O` upflows\ndeduced from topside profiles by Lockwood (1982) and\nobservations of thermal magnetospheric plasma by the\nRIMS experiment on DE-1 (Chappell, 1982; Moore et al.,\n1984; Chandler, 1991). Above 550 eV, the flux of O` in\nauroral ion beams can exceed that of H` by a factor of\n5 (Ghielmetti et al., 1979; Gorney et al., 1981; Collin et al.,\n1981).\nUpward flows of ionospheric ions have been confirmed\nby EISCAT radar studies (Jones et al., 1988; Winser et al.,\n1989; Keating et al., 1990; Wahlund et al., 1992). Keating\net al. (1990) performed a statistical survey of high-flux\nfield-aligned flows seen by EISCAT and showed that they\nwere most likely to occur in the winter between 1900 and\n0400 UT, with their occurrence peaking at about 2100 UT.\nAt least two distinct types of ion outflow have been found.\nOne is associated with frictional heating events caused by\nenhanced DC electric fields (Winser et al., 1989) and is\ncharacterised by an increase in field-aligned ion velocity\nand ion temperature but no significant increase in electron\ndensity at E-region altitudes. The large ion temperatures\nand temperature anisotropy (To\u2019TE) in these events\nindicate the existence of high electric fields. Another class\nof event (Wahlund et al., 1992) is associated with electron\nprecipitation (indicated by E-region density increases) and\nlarge electron-temperature increases without a large in-\ncrease in ion temperature.\nThe ionosphere provides several other, seemingly con-\ntinuous, sources of ions to the magnetosphere, namely the\npolar wind and the cleft ion fountain. The polar wind\n(Banks and Holzer, 1969) consists of H` and He` ions,\nexpelled from the ionosphere by the ambipolar field gener-\nated by the charge separation of the O` gas and the\nlighter electron gas. The classical theory of the polar wind\npredicted that the heavier O` ions would be gravitation-\nally bound, but data from the DE-1 satellite showed that\nhigh-altitude ion flows sometimes consist almost entirely\nof O` at low energies. Yau et al. (1984) found that the\noccurrence probability of O` above 10 eV could be as\nlarge as 30% in the polar cap. Likewise, the RIMS instru-\nment on DE-1 showed that O` ions could be dominant in\nthe polar cap in the energy range 0\u201450 eV (Waite et al.,\n1985). Waite et al. found further that in several of the cases\nthat they studied, the O` ions originated from a restricted\npart of the polar cap and had subsequently been carried\ntowards the nightside by anti-sunward convection. Lock-\nwood et al. (1985a) identified this persistent source of\nupflowing ionospheric ions (including O`) in the energy\nrange 1\u201420 eV as coming from the cleft, and subsequently\ncoined the term \u2018\u2018cleft ion fountain\u2019\u2019 (Lockwood et al.,\n1985b).\nIonospheric ion upflows bear a complex relationship to\nactual O` outflow into the magnetosphere. Ion upflow in\nthe ionosphere consists mainly of O` ions, but this sup-\nports in part the escape of H` via charge exchange. The\nflux of H` escaping into the magnetosphere has a max-\nimum value and O` escape is often inferred from low-\naltitude upflows which exceed this value. It is also unclear\nhow much of the O` upflow simply falls back to the Earth\nat a later time under gravity (Chandler, 1995). Further-\nmore, upflows can be part of a thermal expansion of the\nionosphere, the ions subsequently returning when it con-\ntracts again. However, the elevation of ions to an altitude\nwhere transverse or parallel acceleration can act to give\nthem sufficient velocity to overcome gravity will enhance\nO` escape fluxes. Ions with the greatest parallel velocity\nare carried farthest down the tail by high-latitude convec-\ntion. Since the velocity of O` ions is four times less than\nthat of protons of the same energy, the time of flight of O`\nions along a given field-aligned path is four times larger\nthan that of H`, and the distance moved by the convect-\ning field line is likewise that much larger. This means that\nconvection influences O` trajectories far more than H`\ntrajectories, and that O` from the nightside auroral oval\nFig. 1. A schematic illustration of the respective paths into the\nmagnetosphere of O` ions from the dayside cleft and the nightside\nauroral ionosphere. The empty arrow represents the dipolarisation\nconvection surge. X marks the tail reconnection neutral line. Recon-\nnection at X allows cleft-ion-fountain plasma to cross the\nopen\/closed field line boundary closer to the Earth (at A)\nwill tend to be deposited in the near-Earth tail\n(GSM\/GSE X\"!5 to !10R\nE\n).\nIt has been suggested that ions from the cleft may\ncontribute to substorm onset (Cladis and Francis, 1992).\nTo be seen in the energetic particle injection associated\nwith the substorm expansion phase, the O` must already\nbe present in the magnetosphere on the field lines which\ndipolarise in the convection surge. Ions that come from\nthe cleft are initially on open field lines and stay frozen on\nto the field lines along which they were ejected as the field\nlines convect across the polar cap. Therefore, for cleft-ion-\nfountain ions to gain access to the onset region, they must\nfirst cross the open\/closed field-line separatrix (A in Fig. 1)\nwhich can only happen if there is ongoing closure of open\nflux at the neutral line during the growth phase. The only\nalternative to this is through violation of the frozen-in\napproximation, such as finite gyro-radius effects. How-\never, it is unlikely that these can on their own give rise to\nlarge-scale transport of ions across the separatrix. With-\nout growth phase reconnection at the neutral line, cleft-\nion-fountain ions travel down the tail lobe and have no\naccess to the onset region (an alternative trajectory, which\nis also shown in Fig. 1). Since the travel time from the cleft\nto the onset region is typically several hours (as demon-\nstrated by the convection time in the ionosphere; see also\nsimulations by Cladis and Francis, 1992), there is insuffi-\ncient time for O` leaving the cleft in the growth phase to\nreach the onset region by the time of onset at the end of\nthat growth phase. This is true even if tail reconnection\ndoes take place during the growth phase. It is now be-\nlieved that substorm onset occurs on closed field lines at\nthe inner edge of the plasma sheet (Elphinstone et al.,\n1991; Samson et al., 1992a, b, Murphree et al., 1993;\nLopez et al., 1993; Gazey et al., 1995); the evidence for this\nhas recently been reviewed by Lockwood (1995). Ions\nwhich have been ejected into the magnetosphere from the\nclosed field-line region, e.g. by an arc equatorward of the\nopen\/closed field-line boundary, but poleward of the onset\nregion, already find themselves on closed field lines and\nN.

The magnetogram recorded at Troms\u00f8\nAuroral Observatory on 7 March 1991.\nNegative H indicates a westward electrojet.\nPositive Z indicates that the electrojet is to the\nsouth of Troms\u00f8.

The\ntwo possible sources of O` are illustrated in Fig. 1.\n2 Observations\nThe interval under discussion in this paper is 2120\u20142230\nUT on 7 March 1991. From the magnetogram recorded at\nTroms\u00f8 (Fig. 2), we see that this interval encompassed the\nthird in a sequence of substorms that occurred on that\nevening and, as for the previous two, the electrojet signa-\nture indicates a westward electrojet, centred to the south\nof Troms\u00f8. Data on the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) from the IMP-8 satellite (Fig. 3) show that the\nZ component had been negative (at the spacecraft) since\nabout 2020UT, and thus that open magnetospheric flux is\nlikely to have been generated for at least an hour and\na half before this substorm occurred.\nWe also call upon data from the combined release and\nradiation effects satellite (CRRES) (Wilken et al., 1992),\nwhich flew in a geosynchronous transfer orbit, inclined at\n180 to the equatorial plane, with apogee at 6.3R\nE\n. The\nspin period was about 27 s. From December 1990 until\nApril 1991, a period which encompassed the observations\npresented here, apogee was within a few hours of local\nmidnight. With CRRES\u2019 orbit being nearly geostationary\nnear apogee, it was well placed to measure nightside\nsubstorm phenomena. Figure 4a pictures orbit 548 of the\nsatellite, with the interval covered by Fig. 4b (2120\u20142320\nUT, 7 March 1991) marked in bold. The nightside of the\nEarth is coloured black and the axes are measured in units\nof Earth radii in the GSM coordinate system. In the upper\npanel, the orbit is shown from the viewpoint of the dawn\nsector of the equatorial plane, while in the lower panel one\nlooks down upon the equatorial plane from above\nthe north pole. During the period 2120\u20142230 UT, CRRES\nwas quite near to the magnetic equatorial plane and also\nwest of EISCAT, although it was on an \u201a-shell (\u201a\"6.6)\nclose to EISCAT\u2019s. Figure 4b traces CRRES\u2019 northern\nmagnetic footprint. CRRES was within the domain of\nthe Earth\u2019s internal magnetic field during the period of\ninterest.\nFigure 5 shows data from the magnetospheric ion com-\nposition spectrometer (MICS) instrument which mea-\nsured atomic mass and charge states of ions in the range\n1\u2014425keV\/Q (Wilken et al., 1992). Ions entering the instru-\nment passed through three detector stages: the electro-\nstatic analyser, in which only ions of particular energy-to-\ncharge ratio (E\/Q) could traverse the full length of the\nanalyser (voltage varied in 32 logarithmic steps from\n1\u2014425 keV); the time-of-flight detector which allowed the\nenergy-to-mass ratio (E\/m) to be measured; and a solid-\nstate detector which measured the total energy (E) of ions\nabove 40 keV which had made it there. This triplet of\nmeasurements yields E, m and Q. The colour contours of\nFig. 5 show spin-averaged count rates, which are nearly\nproportional to differential number flux (m~2 s~1 sr~1).\nThe top panel (DCR) shows all counts which registered\na time of flight in the MICS instrument. The next two\npanels show counts of alpha particles (He2`) and oxygen\nions (O`), respectively. Note that most of the counts\nwhich figure in the DCR panel are due to hydrogen ions\n(H`), not He2` or O`.\nThe dispersive features visible on the plots are termed\ndrift echoes and arise because ions from a given injection\ndrift round the Earth at different speeds due to grad-B\ndrift, according to their energy per unit charge (E\/Q).\nSuperimposed upon Fig. 5 are simulated drift echoes for\nions in a dipole magnetic field (Grande et al., 1992). The\ndrift motion of particles in the energy range of the MICS\ninstrument arises predominantly from magnetic-field\ngradient effects, the effect of electric fields being negligible.\nIn the modelling, ions are assumed to be trapped at the\n1034 N.

Also plotted are the positions of the substorm electrojet as it\nprogressed westwards. W1 and E1 are the westward and eastward\nends of the current wedge for 2139 UT; W2 and E2 are for 2144 UT;\nW3 and E3 are for 2152 UT; and W4 and E4 are for 2156 UT\nmagnetic equator and to drift westwards in circular orbits\nwith a period proportional to the reciprocal of ion E\/Q\nand geocentric distance (Lyons and Williams, 1984). The\nUT and MLT of each simulated drift echo is varied to\nmatch the observations and the best-fit injection location\nin UT, and MLT is given in the bottom left-hand corner of\nFig. 5. The model reproduces the observed drift echoes\nfairly accurately, despite its simplicity. This means that we\ncan estimate the injection location of O` and He2` ions\nobserved by MICS, which is crucial in trying to compare\nCRRES and EISCAT observations when CRRES was\nmagnetically west of EISCAT. Figure 5 shows two\nsimulated drift echoes, one from the first major injection\nseen by CRRES (black line) which contained both He2`\nand O` ions and the second (grey line) from a subsequent\noxygen-rich injection. Modelling of the first, He2`-rich,\ninjection places it at 2143 UT (2234 MLT) while the sub-\nsequent O`-rich injection seems to have taken place at\n2200 UT (2258 MLT). The location of the injection point\nin UT is fairly well determined by the modelling, although\nthe deduced injection MLT may be out by up to about\n30 min. Nevertheless, the modelling does show that the\ninjections occurred at an MLT close to EISCAT\u2019s (\\2330\nMLT) at that UT.\nSubstorm onset occurred at 2139 UT, as deduced from\nSAMNET magnetometer data (Fig. 6a) (Yeoman et al.,\n1990). Onset is in evidence both as perturbations in the\nH components from the various stations (Fig. 6b) and as\nPi2 pulsations in H (Fig. 6c). At all SAMNET sites, with\nthe sole exception of NOR, the deviation in Z (Fig. 6d) at\nonset was negative, suggesting that the onset electrojet\nwas north of the SAMNET network. Since the Troms\u00f8\nmagnetogram (Fig. 2) indicates that the onset electrojet\nwas to the south of Troms\u00f8, we can surmise that the onset\nelectrojet fell between Troms\u00f8 and SAMNET in geomag-\nnmetic latitude. We have applied the York electrojet\nmodel (Orr and Craymonson, 1994) to these data. The\nmovement of the substorm electrojet as deduced by this\nmodel is represented (approximately, in geographic co-\nordinates) in Fig. 4b by a series of dots and crosses\nrepresenting the field-aligned currents at the ends of the\nelectrojet at various times. In geographic coordinates, the\nmodel puts the western end of the onset electrojet at about\nN. G. J. Gazey et al.: EISCAT\/CRRES observations 1035\nFig. 5.

Note that the\nNordli (NOR) magnetometer was saturated between about 2120 and\n2210 UT; c SAMNET H components filtered to show Pi2 pulsa-\ntions; d Magnetic Z components observed by SAMNET stations on\n7 March 1991\n65\u00b0N, 10\u201413\u00b0E and the eastern end at 67\u00b0N, 65\u00b0E, its\neastern end therefore stretching well beyond the SAM-\nNET chain (Fig. 4b, [W1, E1]). At about 2144 UT, a sec-\nond electrojet appeared, west of the first and on a similar\n\u201a-shell, with its western end at 352\u00b0E and its eastern end\nat 12\u00b0E, near the centre of the SAMNET array (Fig. 4b,\n[W2, E2]). By 2152UT the two electrojets appear to have\ncoalesced into one whose western end had moved west-\nwards to about 345\u00b0E (Fig. 4b, [W3, E3]). By 2156 UT the\nsingle electrojet had moved still further west to 332\u00b0E\n(Fig. 4b, [W4, E4]). By 2200 UT the current magnitude in\nthe eastern end of the electrojet was falling and had begun\nto sink everywhere at about 2204 UT.\nFigures 7 and 8 show analysed EISCAT results for the\nperiod 2120\u20142230 UT. An increase in ionisation typical of\nan arc can be seen at 2127 UT (panel 1, Fig. 7), followed by\na more major increase in ionisation between 2149 and\n2159UT, when the substorm expanded polewards over the\nEISCAT beam. It is clear that the arc at 2127 UT was\nassociated with a large rise in electron temperature, but\nnot in ion temperature (panels 3 and 4). Also, the field-\naligned velocity (panel 5), both before and after the event\nwas relatively high, and there was a noticeable ion outflux\nduring the event itself (panel 6, units of 1012m~2 s~1). At\n2140 UT, a series of quasi-periodic electron-density en-\nhancements with a period of 6\u20148 min and substructure of\nperiod 1\u20142 min began to populate the region of the EIS-\nCAT beam at F-region altitudes. This material probably\ndrifted into EISCAT\u2019s field of view from the dayside\n(Lockwood and Carlson, 1992).\nFigure 9 shows an accompanying sequence of all-sky\ncamera pictures taken during the substorm.

The first panel (log\n10\nn\ne\n, mea-\nsured in m~3) incorporates multipulse data (90\u2014150km) at 1-min\nresolution and long pulse data (150\u2014570 km) at 10-s resolution.

No\ndata is available between 2217 and\n2230UT\nobservation site, is at the centre of each plate. At 2122 UT\na faint, magnetically east-west aligned arc appeared to the\nnorth of Troms\u00f8 (Fig.9a), developing a kink by 2123 30UT\n(Fig. 9b). As this arc moved southwards (Fig. 9c, d), the\nkink gradually straightened out and the arc was fading as\nit passed through the EISCAT beam at approximately\n2127UT. As it did so, it caused the arc signatures in the\nEISCAT data \u2014 panel 6, Fig. 7, for example, shows the\nclear upflux of ionospheric plasma associated with it. The\narc over Troms\u00f8 finally faded by 2129UT. At 2140UT\n(Fig. 9e), shortly after onset, the poleward edge of the\nbulge brightened and moved northwards, eventually en-\ngulfing the scattering volume and causing the expansion\nphase signatures in the EISCAT data (Fig. 7).\n3 Discussion\nWe wish to consider whether O` ions ejected in the\nupflow that was associated with the southward-drifting\npre-onset arc could have appeared in the O` injections\nmeasured by CRRES, or whether these energetic ions\ncame from the cleft ion fountain on the dayside. South-\nward convection (Fig. 8) would then have carried the flux\ntube equatorwards until it arrived at the ionospheric onset\nlocation. Consider a nightside flux tube which crosses the\nEarth\u2019s equatorial plane at about 10 R\nE\n, which we take to\nbe the approximate onset location. Ions ejected from the\ntopside ionosphere must travel approximately 15R\nE\nalong the flux tube before reaching the central plasma\nsheet. To make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the\nflight time of O` ions along the flux tube, let us consider\nthe ions in question to be weakly accelerated in the top-\nside ionosphere and have an energy of 25 eV until they\nreach a distance of 1R\nE\nalong the flux tube, whereupon\nthey are accelerated to about 1 keV, becoming an ion\nbeam. Using simple considerations, one arrives at a flight\ntime of approximately 15 min. If we reduce the assumed\nenergy of the O` below 1R\nE\nto 5 eV, we increase the\ntravel time to approximately 21 min.\nFor ions ejected via the arc to have entered the onset\nregion and there to be energised (so as to be detected by\nCRRES), the foot of the flux tube on to which they are\nfrozen must have reached the ionospheric location of\nonset \u2014 namely the bright auroral bulge visible to the very\nsouth of the all-sky-camera field of view \u2014 by the time\nonset occurred. Note that a flux tube moves with the\nplasma velocity, not the arc velocity, and that the arc may,\nin fact, move through the background plasma (Haerendel\net al., 1993; Gazey et al., 1995). The all-sky camera sub-\ntends an angle of about 150\u00b0. Elevation can be measured\noff the images linearly over this range. At an emission\nheight of about 120 km, therefore, the field of view has\na span of about 900 km. The southward velocity of the\nbackground plasma before the arc entered the beam was\nabout 250 m s~1 and after it had passed through the beam\nabout 500 ms~1 (we cannot tell whether the flow speed\ndiffered greatly from these values when the arc was away\nfrom the EISCAT beam, but assume that they do not). At\nthe first of these two speeds, the foot of the flux tube would\nhave moved about 350 km (\\3.1\u00b0 invariant latitude) and\nfor the second speed about 475 km (\\4.2\u00b0 invariant lati-\ntude) in the F region between the arc\u2019s appearance to the\nnorth of Troms\u00f8 and the arrival of ejected O` ions in the\nplasma sheet. Since the distance in the ionosphere between\nthe place where the arc appeared and the location of the\nonset bulge is 450\u2014500 km, it is in either case feasible (to\nthe accuracy of this calculation), that southward convec-\ntive flow was fast enough to carry the O` ejected by the\narc into the onset region, i.e. the southward-drifting arc\ndescribed here would have been in a suitable location to\nact as a source of the O` seen at onset.\nN.

The plates\nare geographically aligned, with north at the top and east to the\nright. The mosaic effect on some of the pictures is due to the dynamic\nresolution adopted to solve data storage problems\nFigure 10a shows the flux of the ionospheric ions in the\nupflow event measured by EISCAT at 2127 UT as a func-\ntion of UT and altitude. The left-hand panel shows ion\nflux at approximately 10-s resolution. The arc is clearly\nvisible and delineated by two white lines. The right-hand\npanel shows the altitude profile of flux integrated over this\ninterval. The flux reaches a maximum value of 4.77]\n1014m~2 s~1 at about 500 km. The fact that no asymp-\ntotic value is reached with increasing altitude may mean\nthat there is an upwelling at F-region altitudes after which\nsome O` sinks back down into the ionosphere again\n(Lockwood, 1982), but note that the radar is measuring\na net upflux above 300 km. We have also calculated the\nflux of high-energy O` along each of the two major drift\nechoes measured by MICS for comparison, as illustrated\nin Fig. 10b, whose first panel shows 2-min (4-spin)\naveraged count rates for energy channels covering\n72.4\u2014101.2 keV, 113.0\u2014156.7 keV, 175.4\u2014246.6 keV and\n275.4\u2014382.0 keV, and whose second panel gives the cor-\nrected O` flux in each of these four energy ranges and for\neach of the two drift echoes considered. Converting the\nMICS differential count rates to flux values is acheived\n1040 N. G. J. Gazey et al.: EISCAT\/CRRES observations\nFig. 10. a The upward flux of ionospheric ions, as measured by\nEISCAT during transition of the arc through the EISCAT beam at\nabout 2127UT. The left-hand panel shows flux (n\ne\n]vE ) as a function\nof altitude and UT, with the interval containing the arc bounded by\ntwo white lines. Immediately to its right is a scale showing flux\nvalues. The right-hand panel shows the altitude profile of flux integ-\nrated over this time interval (roughly 2127\u20142128) spanned by the two\nwhite lines. b O`-ion flux measured by MICS during the two\nprimary injections (echos 1 and 2) that are visible in Fig. 5. The\nbottom panel shows the uncorrected count rates (120-s averages) in\nfour energy ranges selected by averaging over a number of the\navailable 32 energy steps. The circles represent the points which lie\nalong the dispersed echo. These are used in the calculation of the\nactual flux which is shown in the top panel\nusing the equation:\nj\"dJ\ndE\n\" C\nG \u00b7DE \u00b7 g\nwhere j is the differential number flux in cm~2 s~1\nsr~1 keV~1, C is the measured count rate, G is the instru-\nment\u2019s geometric factor, DE is the respective energy band\nand g is the efficiency of the sensor. The correct j for sensor\ndegradation is thus:\nj\"j\nmeas A\n\u201eCR\nSSD B\ncalibration\n\u00b7A\n\u201eCR\nSSD B\nmeasured\nwhere \u201eCR stands for the total count rate and SSD stands\nfor the count rate at the solid-state detector. The efficien-\ncies and calibration values are available in tabulated form\n(personal communication, G. Kettmann, Copernicus-\nGesellschaft, Katlenburg-Lindau). The value of the O`\nflux (m~2 s~1), summed over all four energy bins, in the\nfirst (He2`-rich) injection was 3.5]1010m~2 s~1, and the\nvalue of the O` flux in the second (O`-rich) injection was\n6]1010m~2 s~1. The strength of the field at CRRES, B\nC\n,\nwas measured to be 140 nT, while the strength of the field\nin the ionosphere, B\nI\n, is taken to be constant at 50000 nT.\nThe magnetic flux in the flux tube at CRRES, B\nC\nA\nC\n,\nequals that in the ionosphere end of the tube, namely\nB\nI\nA\nI\n, where A refers to the local cross-sectional area of the\nflux tube. Therefore the ratio of the areas, A\nC\n\/A\nI\n\"B\nI\n\/B\nC\n,\nand we apply a mapping factor of 50000\/140K360 to\naccount for the increasing cross-sectional area with alti-\ntude of the flux tube between the Earth and CRRES, i.e.\nwe require a flux of 1.25]1013 m~2 s~1 from the iono-\nsphere to explain the injection signature. The upflux mea-\nsured by EISCAT while the arc was in the radar\u2019s beam\nhad a maximum value of about 4.77]1014m~2 s~1\n(Fig. 10a). The ionospheric O` outflux is adequate to\nexplain all the ions seen by CRRES, with the proviso that\nnot all upflowing ions will escape and MICS does not see\nall ions due to its restricted energy coverage.\nFor the cleft ion fountain to have been the source of the\nO`, the flux tube on which they were situated would have\nhad to be transported over the polar cap. The polar cap is\nsituated at approximately \\80\u00b0 \" on the dayside, and\n\\65\u00b0 \" on the nightside, such that its diameter at F-\nregion altitudes is approximately 4000 km. Given a field-\nperpendicular plasma velocity of the order of 0.5 kms~1,\nthe time required for cleft-ion fountain O` to reach the\nonset region is well over an hour.\nWe would expect both injections to have taken place\nwithin the substorm current wedge. In the injection\nmodelling, the first, He2`-rich injection is put at 2143 UT\n(2234 MLT), roughly 30 min away to the west of EISCAT\nin MLT and still within the all-sky camera\u2019s field of\nview, since this time difference corresponds to about\n430 km at ionospheric altitudes. At 2143UT, the western\nend of the electrojet was at 352\u00b0E (geographic) and the\ninjection took a further 2 min to reach CRRES, whose\nnorthern magnetic footprint was at geographic longitude\n340\u00b0E. It therefore seems likely that this injection orig-\ninated close to the western end of the substorm electrojet.\nThe second, O`-rich injection is placed at 2200UT and\n2300MLT, i.e. close to EISCAT\u2019s MLT and within the\ncurrent wedge.\n4 Conclusions\nDue to CRRES\u2019 favourable location with respect to EIS-\nCAT, we are able to suggest a link between EISCAT\nN. G. J. Gazey et al.: EISCAT\/CRRES observations 1041\nmeasurements of oxygen outflow and CRRES measure-\nments of oxygen injections at substorm onset. The injec-\ntions that have been modelled in this paper form a rela-\ntively unusual double injection \u2014 He2` followed by O`\n\u2014 of the type recently revealed by CRRES data (Grande et\nal., 1992). It appears that the southward-drifting pre-onset\narc visible near Troms\u00f8 could well have been a source of\nO` particles observed by CRRES in the particle injections\nat onset.\nWe do not completely rule out the cleft ion fountain as\na source of O`, since the growth phase of this substorm\nlasted for over an hour. The arrival of patches of density in\nthe nightside ionosphere at about the time of onset might\nmean that cleft-ion-fountain ions ejected upwards at the\nstart of the growth phase reached the onset region in the\nmagnetosphere by the time of onset. However, for O` ions\nfrom the cleft ion fountain to have had access to the onset\nregion, there would have had to have been reconnection at\nthe distant neutral line prior to onset. Growth phase\nreconnection in the tail is not a requirement for the south-\nward-drifting arc source, which was on closed field lines,\nso these ions would have had direct access to the onset\nregion, which was also on closed field lines (see summary\nby Kennel, 1992).\nAcknowledgements.
