Given the 300,000 years of\nstasis that precede it, this example of culture change is\nan event of singular importance that goes beyond lithic\ntechnology and may herald the emergence of more pro-\nfound changes in hominid social, behavioural, and cog-\nnitive structures. Despite this, the origins of Levallois\ntechnology have of late been a remarkably neglected area\nof research.\nMost recently published accounts of the origins of Le-\nvallois technology in Europe have tended to emphasize\nan in situ evolution from handaxe technology (Tuffreau\n1995, Rolland 1995, White and Pettitt 1995; see also De-\nbono and Goran-Inbar 2001 for the Near East). For Rol-\nland (1995), the presence of finely made handaxes would\nhave led almost inevitably to the accidental discovery of\nthe Levallois method via large axial thinning flakes. Ex-\namples of such detachments (what Callow [1976] termed\n\u201cpseudo-Levallois\u201d) can be observed in numerous\nAcheulean contexts, perhaps the best-known of which\nis at Cagny La Garenne, France (late oxygen isotope stage\n12), where on occasion what appear to be preferential\nLevallois cores have been formed from handaxes broken\nduring manufacture or sometimes from very thick com-\nplete handaxes (Tuffreau 1995). If such an emergence is\naccepted, then the development of Levallois technology\nin Europe would appear to have been a disjointed, mul-\ntiphase affair involving the precocious but unstable mu-\ntation of handaxes (probably from the earliest European\nAcheulean) followed by the much later sedimentation\nand elaboration of the technique sometime around stage\n8 (Rolland 1995). By stage 7 Levallois technology was\nwidespread and all the currently documented variation\nwas in place, suggesting rapid development, diversifi-\ncation, and dispersal (Tuffreau 1995). A completely dif-\nferent and quite separate evolution is described for Af-\nrica, where the Levallois method is suggested to have\nemerged gradually from simpler core-working strategies\nthrough a series of proto-stages (Rolland 1995).\nWhile the timing of these events, especially in Africa,\nis still to be fully worked out, the picture of continuity\nin Africa combined with discontinuity and the apparent\nlack of any proto-stage in Europe ostensibly lends sup-\nport to Foley and Lahr\u2019s (1997) \u201cMode 3\u201d hypothesis.\nThis advocates an exclusively African genesis for pre-\npared-core technologies, with their subsequent intro-\nduction to Europe ca. 250,000 years ago as part of a major\ndispersal event by Homo helmei, proposed as the most\nrecent common ancestor for Neanderthals and anatom-\nically modern Homo sapiens. With this model Foley and\nLahr explain the common use of Levallois technology by\nthese two species in the Levant ca. 100,000 years ago\nbut in doing so also implicate the Neanderthals more\nclosely in the origins of anatomically modern humans,\n\u201cmodern\u201d behaviour, and the African Middle Stone Age.\nIn light of recent work on the Middle Stone Age (Mc-\nBrearty and Brooks 2000), such a connection would de-\nmand a radical reevaluation of the way we look at the\nVolume 44, Number 4, August\u2013October 2003 F 599\nEuropean archaeological record from 250,000 years ago\nonwards.\nThis paper presents some observations on the tech-\nnological origins of Levallois using the lithic assemblage\nfrom Botany Pit at Purfleet, augmented by some obser-\nvations on the small collection of cores and refitting\nflakes from Frindsbury, England. It suggests that the core\ntechnology from these sites is a relatively simple and\nunrefined form of prepared-core technology geared to-\nwards attaining greater control over cores and their prod-\nucts; given their age and character it may be justifiable\nto call this \u201cproto-Levallois\u201d technology (Wymer 1968).\n(For present purposes we will adopt the slightly less\nloaded term \u201csimple prepared-core\u201d technology.) These\nconclusions carry implications for the origins of Leval-\nlois technology and the origins of the Neanderthals.\nthe purfleet site\nPurfleet is located in the Lower Thames Valley, 20 km\neast of central London. Since the 1960s a complex se-\nquence of Pleistocene deposits has been exposed in a\nseries of commercial pits (fig. 1). The deposits are inter-\npreted to belong to an abandoned meander loop of the\nmain River Thames and to form part of the Lynch Hill\/\nCorbets Tey Formation (Bridgland 1994), which on lith-\nological and biostratigraphical correlation spans oxygen\nisotope stages terminal 10 to early 8 (Bridgland 1994,\nSchreve et al. 2002). The sediments at Botany Pit consist\nof some 3.4 m of sand and gravel banked up against a\nChalk river-cliff and are interpreted as the upper part of\nthe complete Purfleet sequence seen in Bluelands and\nGreenlands Pits, dating to late stage 9\/early stage 8 (i.e.,\n1 300,000 years). Equivalent deposits in the neighbouring\nGreenlands Pit have provided an averaged age of 324,000\nyears by optically stimulated luminescence (Eddie\nRhodes, personal communication).\nThe slightly rolled flint assemblage, recovered by\nSnelling in 1961 (Wymer 1968, 1985), is essentially a\ncore-and-flake industry with few formal tools. Wymer\n(1968) described some of the cores from Botany Pit as\nproto-Levallois, and Roe (1981:228) too detected a much\nhigher level of controlled flaking and considered some\nto represent a \u201creduced\u201d Levallois method. Included in\nthe Botany material are a small number of handaxes,\nrecorded by Snelling as coming from the base of the Bot-\nany sequence and reportedly resting directly on Chalk.\nThey probably predate the core-and-flake assemblage,\nand it seems likely that they are the final occurrence of\nthe Acheulean industry represented in the Middle Gravel\n(the Bluelands Gravel of Schreve et al. 2002) in other pits\nfrom the area.\ncore technology at botany pit\nThe study of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic cores has\nundergone a dramatic shift in emphasis in the past 20\nyears (Boe\u00a8da 1986, 1995; Chazan 1997; Ashton 1992,\n1998), moving from an essentially typological approach\n(study of final form) to an explicit concern with tech-\nnology (study of process). This is especially evident in\nthe study of the Levallois method. Advocates and op-\nponents of the two approaches are equally divided over\nseveral issues (cf. Boe\u00a8da 1988, 1995; Dibble 1989; Van\nPeer 1992, 1995; Schlanger 1996), but the technological\nschool has nevertheless succeeded in identifying a set of\nclear and replicable criteria for recognizing the Levallois\nconcept that potentially avoids the major interanalyst\nvariation and ambiguity that plague the typological ap-\nproach (see Perpe`re 1986). It has also extended the bound-\naries of Levallois technology to subsume far greater var-\niation than previously recognized (see Boe\u00a8da 1986, 1995;\nBoe\u00a8da, Geneste, and Meignen 1990; Chazan 1997). A\ntechnological approach is adopted here.\nA total of 268 cores from Botany Pit from the Snelling\nCollection at the British Museum were examined during\nthe present study. The cores can be classified into three\nbasic operational schemas, although there is undoubt-\nedly a continuum of variation in the approach to each\nof them.\nThe largest category (49%) can be described as mi-\ngrating-platform cores of the kind that typify Lower Pa-\nlaeolithic technology in Europe. The working of these\ncores consists of one or more sequences of flaking (core\nepisodes), each episode involving single, parallel, or,\nmost often, alternate flaking (Ashton 1998). Knapping\ngenerally proceeds in a varied and organic fashion, with\nthe evolving morphology of the core strongly influencing\nthe location and character of each core episode. The re-\nsulting cores vary enormously in morphology and the\ndegree of working, have a diverse range of platforms, and\nare frequently quite chunky. The intention behind this\ntype of working appears to be the removal of medium-\nsized flakes, which, because of the predominant use of\nalternate flaking techniques (cf. Ashton 1992, 1998; Ash-\nton and McNabb 1996), tends to operate in an invasive\nfashion by removing material from the body or volume\nof the core.\nThe second category (43%) consists of cores previously\ndescribed as proto- or reduced Levallois and clearly dif-\nfers from the above in both concept and form (figs. 2 and\n3). Flaking has been directed at the removal of large\nflakes, mainly in parallel sequences from single or ad-\njacent platforms but sometimes in multiple or opposed\ndirections. Rather than migrating around the core in pur-\nsuit of appropriate angles wherever they emerge, flaking\nis more controlled and is organized around a plane of\nintersection that defines a striking-platform surface and\na flaking surface. Flakes are detached more or less par-\nallel to this plane and remove material from the surface\nof the nodule rather than from its volume. Typically\nthese cores show almost no preparation of either the\nflaking surface or the striking-platform surface. The\nstriking platform was often simply created using one or\nmore bold removals and then a series of flakes was re-\nmoved from that platform, often along the long axis of\nthe nodule. The resultant cores are generally flat, and\nthe negative scars testify to the production of elongated\nflakes. Where more than one platform has been ex-\nploited, the same methods are repeated on other parts of\n600 F current anthropology\nFig. 1. Location map.\nthe core, and the relationship between flaking surface\nand striking-platform surface is preserved. In these cases,\nflaking from one platform dominates, but this is not nec-\nessarily the last platform created. The number of re-\nmovals from each platform is difficult to gauge, although\nthe evidence from the cores shows that two or three\nflakes per platform can be considered a minimum. As\npart of this group, 8% of the assemblage mimic classic\nLevallois by showing a final preferential removal. In\nmost cases the final configuration of the core depends\nentirely on the removal of a large final flake from an\notherwise non-Levallois core. However, two cores do dis-\nplay the features of classic tortoise-cores and may be\nquite deliberate.\nThe third category of core (8%) would generally be\ndescribed as discoidal (Boe\u00a8da 1995). Reduction was aimed\nat the removal of a series of flakes detached centripetally\nfrom two flaking surfaces situated above and below a\nplane of intersection. The surfaces are nonhierarchically\norganized, acting as both a flaking surface and a striking-\nplatform surface, and the plane of intersection defines a\nhinge that extends around the perimeter of the core and\naround which knapping takes place. While these differ\nfrom both the other core types in form and conception\n(see Boe\u00a8da 1995), the distinction is not always techno-\nlogically or typologically clear, and in some cases the\nfinal form may be a fortuitous result of another reduction\nstrategy.\nAlthough three methods of core reduction have been\nidentified, it has proved difficult to distinguish charac-\nteristic flakes that result from each flaking method.\nThere are more than 3,500 flakes from Botany Pit, and\nmost of them display between two and four dorsal flake\nscars that tend to originate from a proximal or sometimes\nlateral direction. The butts are usually plain, occasion-\nally dihedral, and never faceted. One would expect flakes\nresulting from the simple prepared cores to be slightly\nlarger and slightly longer than those produced by other\ntechniques, and large laminar flakes do exist within the\ncollection. In practice, however, and in the absence of\nrefits, it would be unwise to identify all of these as com-\ning from such cores, especially given the probable mixed\nnature of the assemblage. As few diagnostic flake types\nseem to emerge from this type of core reduction, we\nVolume 44, Number 4, August\u2013October 2003 F 601\nFig. 2. Simple prepared core (proto-Levallois) from\nPurfleet.\nFig. 3. Simple prepared core (proto-Levallois) from\nPurfleet.\nsuspect that the purpose of this technique was not so\nmuch to determine the precise form of the flakes as to\ncontrol the volume and thereby the productivity of the\ncore, producing a greater number of larger flakes from\neach nodule.\nAn indication of the type of flake that results purely\nfrom simple prepared cores can be found at the site of\nFrindsbury, Kent (Cook and Killick 1924). This poorly\ndated site produced an assemblage in fresh condition\nfrom a hollow within chalky drift directly above Chalk.\nHere, 14 of the 16 cores are of the simple prepared type,\nand they are associated with 478 flakes and 2 handaxes.\nThe cores are identical to those from Purfleet, with the\nclear intention of flaking across surfaces, again from one\nor more platforms. As this is the dominant reduction\nmethod, the flakes clearly result from this type of flaking\nand, while falling into the range of variation seen within\nthe amassed Purfleet sample, are distinguished by their\ncomparative elongation and the predominance of a uni-\nlinear flake scar pattern. This is illustrated by a group\nof five refitting flakes (fig. 4), all knapped from the single,\nplain platform and presenting no evidence of preparation\non the flaking surface. This type of flake certainly occurs\nas part of the Purfleet assemblage.\nThe refitting, fresh condition, and context (Cook and\nKillick 1924) suggest that the Frindsbury assemblage rep-\nresents a relatively short phase of activity and reveals a\nnarrowly defined set of core reduction practices. In con-\ntrast, the more complex stratigraphic situation at Pur-\nfleet, together with the greater and more variable con-\ndition of the artefacts, suggests the intermixture of\nseveral assemblages, which may explain the wider va-\nriety of core reduction strategies evident.\nis there levallois technology at botany pit?\nPrevious descriptions of the Purfleet simple prepared\ncores have emphasized their similarities to Levallois\ncores (Wymer 1968, Roe 1981). The key question here is\nwhether they can be considered to conform technolog-\nically to the Levallois concept sensu Boe\u00a8da (1986, 1995;\ncf. Chazan 1997). Boe\u00a8da has identified a limited number\n602 F current anthropology\nFig. 4. Group of refitting flakes from a \u201cproto-Leval-\nlois\u201d core from Frindsbury, Kent.\nof technical and geometric principles that underwrite all\nLevallois production (fig. 5). These principles are abso-\nlutely constant, but the manner in which they are exe-\ncuted and the initialization phase may vary, thus pro-\nducing the range of variation now evident within\nLevallois technology. The simple prepared cores from\nPurfleet certainly conform to the Levallois concept in a\nnumber of important respects. The volume of the piece\nis conceived as two surfaces separated by a plane of in-\ntersection (criterion 1), and these surfaces are hierarchi-\ncally related, one being a striking platform surface and\nthe other a flaking surface (criterion 2). The fracture\nplane for the removal is broadly parallel to the plane of\nintersection (criterion 4), and the junction between the\nflaking surface and the striking platform (the hinge) is\nperpendicular to the axis of percussion and oriented to\nallow the removal of flakes from the flaking surface (cri-\nterion 5). Flaking is also exclusively done with a hard\nhammer (criterion 6). However, the Purfleet conception\nalso differs from the strict Levallois concept in several\nrespects. Most important, the flaking surface does not\nshow the maintenance of distal and lateral convexities\n(criterion 3), and the preparation of either surface is min-\nimal. Overall, the cores appear technologically under-\ndeveloped and procedurally truncated, especially when\ncompared with classic Levallois cores. The core and its\nproducts are certainly under some control, and reduction\nis clearly geared towards removing large flakes from a\nsurface rather than a volume (Boe\u00a8da 1995), controlling\nthe size of the product and the productivity of the core.\nStill, they do not appear to conform strictly to the Le-\nvallois concept.\nIf one or more of the underwriting principles is absent,\ncan the technology still be considered Levallois? The\nsame question was asked by Kuhn (1995) in his analyses\nof Pontinian Middle Palaeolithic assemblages from the\nLatium coast of Italy. Kuhn provided details of \u201cprepared\nplatform cores\u201d that fulfilled some criteria of the Le-\nvallois concept but not others; like the Purfleet simple\nprepared cores they did not maintain distal and lateral\nconvexities of the flaking surface (criterion 3) and had\nonly limited core preparation and weak predetermina-\ntion. Kuhn suggested that this might be a Levallois strat-\negy stripped down to its essentials (i.e., two hierarchi-\ncally related surfaces separated by a plane of intersection)\nto exploit the natural convexities of diminutive pebble\nblanks. This may be similar to the case of the stage 5\/4\nsite of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, France (Guette 2002)\nwhere, using poor-quality beach pebbles, the convexities\nof the cores were minimally maintained but flakes were\nremoved with clear platform alteration and preparation.\nIn contrast, Chazan (1997:732) suggests that because\ncriterion 3 requires only that the two faces be organized\nin terms of convexities, not that they be shaped into\nsuch, then Kuhn\u2019s material, perhaps that of Saint-Vaast-\nla-Hougue, and by implication the Botany material are\nLevallois products. However, as far as we can see, or-\nganizing two convexities is tantamount to shaping.\nIt is shaping that immediately leads into the issue of\npredetermination or intentionality. Although this con-\ncept is popularly perceived to be inherent in the Levallois\nstrategy, it has been disputed by some writers, particu-\nlarly in questioning the Levallois method as a means of\nproducing \u201cprivileged flakes.\u201d Davidson (2002) uses Van\nPeer\u2019s refitting work, which showed that many prepar-\natory flakes were absent from knapping floors at several\nsites in Egypt, suggesting that Levallois flakes were not\nnecessarily the desired end product. By contrast, many\n\u201cfinal flakes\u201d were simply abandoned at the knapping\nsite. However, Van Peer (1992:114) provides several rea-\nsons that the Levallois strategy is an intentional act de-\nsigned to produce large flakes (not necessarily of uniform\nshape and size). The strongest arguments are the aban-\ndonment of perfectly good cores after the production of\na \u201clast\u201d large flake and, conversely, the repetition in flak-\ning arrangement in instances where cores are reprepared\nto provide more than one such flake. He also cites ex-\namples from Nazlet Safaha 1 in Upper Egypt which con-\ntain a number of preparatory elements but no Levallois\ncores and flakes, the inference being that the preparatory\nand final stages have occurred in different parts of the\nsite or elsewhere. He also warns against uncritically\nequating missing elements with human agency rather\nthan excavation or refitting biases. In essence, the pro-\nVolume 44, Number 4, August\u2013October 2003 F 603\nFig. 5. Boe\u00a8da\u2019s technological criteria for identifying the Levallois method (drawings modified after Boe\u00a8da\n1995).\nduction of a large flake does not automatically reduce\nall other flakes to unwanted waste, and, while we might\nexpect Neanderthals to have selected a range of flakes\nfor future use, depending on need and context, this does\nnot mean that the final large flake was unintended and\nunwanted.\nDibble (1989) takes a slightly different line, using a\ntechnological analysis of flakes from five sites in south-\nern France to cast doubt on the degree of predetermi-\nnation present in Levallois products. His data demon-\nstrate that Levallois products are just as variable in terms\nof shape and size as non-Levallois flakes and handaxe\nthinning flakes, leading him to conclude that the Le-\nvallois method is a reductive strategy designed to extract\nmany serviceable flakes from a single core rather than a\nsingle desired end product.\nChazan (1997:727) provides a neat pre\u00b4cis of the current\nsituation, suggesting that we do not know what the ex-\npectations of the knapper were in terms of predetermined\nflakes and by-products but we can surmise that the entire\nproject of knapping was carried out with a specific plan\nof action and some knowledge of the end product. Our\nanalysis and, we would suggest, that of Van Peer and\nBoe\u00a8da are consistent with this conclusion.\nIn the case of Purfleet, then, there is a degree of in-\ntentionality in the sense of a specific plan of action de-\nsigned to produce a series of large flakes but not prede-\ntermination through the shaping of the surface of cores\n(criterion 3) to produce one or more privileged or stan-\ndardized flakes. We are therefore left with a number of\noptions. We could insist that the Purfleet simple pre-\npared cores are merely stripped-down Levallois cores (as\nwith the Pontinian?) stimulated by particular ecological,\neconomic, or other local social factors. In this case what\nwe see at Purfleet is stripped-down variations on lineal\nLevallois as well as unidirectional and bidirectional re-\ncurrent Levallois. While this conclusion might be ac-\nceptable within the limits of the already expanding Le-\nvallois concept, it would really only serve to defy\nattempts to study the Lower-to-Middle Palaeolithic tran-\nsition and render the identification of a proto-stage im-\npossible. Furthermore, in contrast to the Pontinian ex-\nample, there are no obvious reasons here for a\nstripped-down Levallois technology to have been used.\nRaw material was probably abundant at the site, as the\nriver was actively eroding the Chalk river cliff, and there\nare no obvious differences in raw materials between the\ncore types described above. From residual cortex on the\ncores it would seem that the original nodules were me-\ndium-sized to large (20\u201325 cm) and not particularly flat,\nso this cannot be the reason simple prepared-core tech-\nnology was used. Equally, the cores were rarely used to\nexhaustion, so shortage of raw material would not appear\nto have contributed to reduction strategy; on the con-\ntrary, Wymer (1985) described the use of flint at Purfleet\nas extravagant, a factor which in itself might have elic-\nited a less rigid approach in some cases but surely cannot\nexplain the frequency of these cores in a single assem-\nblage and their absence from equally flint-rich horizons\nelsewhere in the local area.\n604 F current anthropology\nThe age, position, and technological parsimony of the\nPurfleet simple prepared cores favour an alternative. The\nPurfleet cores can be seen to represent a proto-Levallois\ntechnology stemming from two very simple conceptual\ninnovations in core reduction: the plane of intersection\nand hierarchically organized surfaces. These two factors\ndictate the configuration of the core, and it is from them\nthat the level of control apparently exercised over the\nmethod of flaking, the core and its products, and the\nassociated technological complex all emerge, without\nnecessarily being fully developed Levallois technology\n(see Kuhn 1995).\nA selection of other western European sites (far from\nexhaustive) broadly contemporary with or slightly\nyounger than Purfleet displays a similar approach to core\nreduction and supports such a conclusion. The Dren-\nthian (stage 8) site of Markkleeberg, Germany (Baumann\nand Mania 1983, Svoboda 1989), contains a number of\ncores showing similar technology alongside a number of\nother Levallois methods. As at Purfleet, the poor strat-\nigraphic resolution at this site may be responsible for\nsuch a mixture. Early prepared-core technology has also\ncome from the site of Mesvin IV, associated with a cool,\nsteppic fauna and attributed to the early Saalian (stage\n8) (Cahen and Michel 1986), while at Argoeuves (Lower\nTerrace Complex of the Somme, stage 8) unidirectional\nand bidirectional techniques have been used to produce\nseries of laminar blanks (Tuffreau 1982, 1995) similar to\nthose from Purfleet and Frindsbury. Rolland (1995) has\nsummarized a wealth of literature that hints at a proto-\nLevallois phase in La Micoque levels 3 and 4; electron\nspin resonance dates for the higher level 5 have provided\nminimum age estimates for levels 3 and 4 ranging from\n241,000 to 288,000 years. Further claims have been made\nfor the site of Korolevo, Ukraine, where proto-Levallois\ncores have been identified as coming from levels that\nhave been thermoluminescence-dated earlier than\n360,000 \u0002 50,000 ago (Adamenko and Gladiline 1988).\nThe best example, however, comes from Orgnac 3,\nFrance, which is dated to 350,000\u2013300,000 years ago\n(Moncel and Combier 1992). Here the basal levels (7\u20136)\nshow a variety of non-Levallois methods, including a\nhierarchically organized centripetal technique, with pre-\npared-core technology first appearing as a numerically\nlow \u201ccomplementary method\u201d in level 5b. In its earliest\nmanifestation it is generally unipolar or bipolar, its over-\nall configuration suggesting to the primary workers a\nmethod that was controlled but whose rules were \u201cnot\nfully standardized \u201d (our emphasis). By levels 4a and 4b\nfully fledged and formalized Levallois technology is seen,\nwith diversification in the method to include most of\nthe variants identified by Boe\u00a8da. What we seem to have\nat Orgnac 3, then, is the gradual emergence, diversifi-\ncation, and standardization of an evolving technological\npractice in Europe as an elaboration of methods already\nin place.\nTaken together these show a persistent and distinct\nchange in approach to core reduction in which, in con-\ntrast to much Lower Palaeolithic flaking, consideration\nis given to core surfaces and volume. Although the re-\nsulting flakes are only weakly predetermined, there is a\nclear element of control over the evolving core and its\nproducts. From the sites listed above this key change\nseems to occur across Europe from about 300,000 years\nago, with the full suite of variation visible by ca.\n250,000\u2013200,000 years ago. The technology at these very\nearly sites, then, suggests that the emergence of the Lev-\nallois method in Europe was gradual, involving the ini-\ntial reorganization and recombination of core technology\nto establish a basic level of controlled flaking, followed\nby refinement, elaboration, and diversification towards\na full Levallois concept.\ndiscussion\nStone tool technology can be divided into two overarch-\ning operational systems: systems of flaking (debitage),\nin which the aim of the action is primarily to divide a\nvolume of material into smaller usable units (i.e., flakes),\nand systems of shaping (fac\u00b8onnage), in which reduction\nis primarily geared towards reducing a mass of material\nusing a complex of interrelated flake scars so that the\nremaining volume takes a desired form (see Boe\u00a8da, Ge-\nneste, and Meignen 1990; Baumler 1995). In the first sys-\ntem the core\u2014the nucleus of the nodule\u2014is essentially\nwaste and flakes are the desired result, while in the sec-\nond system the situation is reversed.\nIn the Lower Palaeolithic, these two systems are es-\nsentially separate, operating according to different con-\nceptual principles and for different purposes. The am-\nbiguous \u201cchopper-cores\u201d notwithstanding, fac\u00b8onnage is\npredominantly manifest as bifaces, based around a plane\nof intersection separating two interdependent surfaces\nthat may be hierarchical or non-hierarchical, biconvex\nor plano-convex, depending on the precise operational\nchain and blank type used (Boe\u00a8da, Geneste, and Meignen\n1990). There is no distinction between predetermining\nand predetermined flake removals, but the important\npoint is that the two surfaces are organized in relation\nto each other. Reduction is oriented towards the removal\nof flakes from the surface of the piece so as to thin and\nshape an inner volume. Some question remains about\nthe status of handaxes made on flakes, which for Boe\u00a8da\net al. represent examples of de\u00b4bitage. In contrast, we see\nthe initial act of de\u00b4bitage (i.e., striking the flake blank)\nas being followed by the shaping of an internal volume\nto fulfil a mental construct, indicating to us that the last\nphase in the production and end result of action is ac-\ntually fac\u00b8onnage. Whether or not this is conceptually\ncorrect, the most important issue here is that the two\nprocedures are separate sequential steps in the biography\nof the object; the technology is non-reflexive.\nSimilarly, Lower Palaeolithic de\u00b4bitage, prior to oxygen\nisotope stage 9\/8 (in Britain at least), is most often op-\nerationalized according to the migrating-platform con-\ncept. This is the simplest way of working a core, showing\nmany varied and interchangeable platforms, no fixed\nplane of intersection, no hierarchically organized sur-\nfaces, little control over flake dimensions, and the work-\ning of a volume rather than a surface. Only the much\nVolume 44, Number 4, August\u2013October 2003 F 605\nrarer discoidal or centripetal cores deviate from this gen-\neral pattern, having a plane of intersection separating\nflaking and striking surfaces, although to what extent\nthese are fortuitous rather than a product of blank shape\nis debatable (see, e.g., Orgnac 3, where centripetal cores\nare common but are produced on flint plaquettes\u2014a case\nof blanks\u2019 dictating a technique or blanks\u2019 being selected\nto facilitate a technique?).\nThe differences evident in the Purfleet and other sim-\nple prepared cores can be described in these terms: as an\nelaboration of de\u00b4bitage brought about by the systematic\napplication of concepts (i.e., plane of intersection and\nhierarchical interdependent surfaces) that had previously\nbeen most common, if not quite unique, to fac\u00b8onnage\n(White and Pettitt 1995). Rather than evolving directly\nfrom handaxes (Rolland 1995, Tuffreau 1995) or arriving\nfully formed courtesy of immigrant African hominids\n(Foley and Lahr 1997), both of which would demand no\nproto-phase, prepared core technologies originated in situ\nwithin north-western Europe (at least) through a gradual\ntransformation of existing core technologies and a fusion\nof elements of both fac\u00b8onnage and de\u00b4bitage. In short,\nthe development of the full Levallois concept represents\nfor us the erosion of boundaries between and the inte-\ngration of two existing systems, the practical fusion of\nfac\u00b8onnage and de\u00b4bitage into a new dynamic. While the\nfinal purpose was undoubtedly the production of select\nflakes, in our view it cannot be considered exclusively\nin terms of de\u00b4bitage, as it contains an elaborate shaping\nphase clearly aimed at controlling the form of an inner\nvolume. But neither is it a system of fac\u00b8onnage, as the\nshaping of the core is only a means to producing desired\nflake blanks. In the Levallois method the core is involved\nin a reflexive interplay of these two concepts, constantly\nmorphing from structured shaping phases to production\nphases; the rigid distinction between operational sche-\nmas seen earlier collapses and constructs that had been\nconceptually separate merge into one unified and highly\nflexible concept. That the products of early Levallois\ntechnology were used unmodified and to produce both\nscrapers and handaxes (with minimal modification) and\nthat, in the wake of its emergence, handaxes tended to\nphase out in some regions serves to demonstrate the na-\nture of this fusion and fundamental restructuring of tech-\nnology. However, standard systems of fac\u00b8onnage and de\u00b4-\nbitage do not disappear as redundant technologies but\ncontinue to exist alongside Levallois technology at var-\nious temporal and spatial scales.\nIf our reading of the Purfleet materials and its impli-\ncations are valid, then there is an in situ evolution of\nLevallois technology in Europe via at least one proto-\nstage. This evolution parallels but is unrelated to the\ntrajectories documented for Africa (Rolland 1995), where\nstochastically occurring examples of prepared-core tech-\nnologies may extend back into the Lower Pleistocene,\nalthough Vermeersch\u2019s (1995) survey of the Northern Af-\nrican evidence failed to find any Levallois technology\nolder than or even as old as that found in Europe. Given\nthat a small and fairly simple mutation of technologies\nthat had existed since the beginning of the Acheulean\/\nDeveloped Oldowan is required for prepared-core tech-\nnologies to emerge, we must entertain the notion of\nmany unrelated, polyphyletic \u201corigins\u201d of the Levallois\nmethod at different times in different places and in dif-\nferent ways (see Bordes 1971, Rolland 1995). In other\nwords, Levallois is immanent within the Acheulean.\nThe Near East is a case in point, for here cores falling\ninto categories of \u201cproto-Levallois\u201d and \u201cflat debitage\u201d\nare evident perhaps as early as 560,000 years ago\n(Copeland and Hours 1993), with a few of the latter some-\nwhat resembling the Purfleet cores. By the Late Acheu-\nlean, non-Levallois flat-debitage cores identical to the\nPurfleet materials are found at sites such as Azraq C-\nSpring, Jordan, tentatively dated to ca. 225,000 years ago\n(Copeland 1989, 1991, 1995). Equally, though, an emer-\ngence from handaxes has been proposed at Tabu\u00afn (De-\nbono and Goran-Inbar 2001). This brings us back to the\nprecocious European Levallois reported at Cagny La Gar-\nenne (Tuffreau 1995), where broken handaxes were ex-\napted into cores that because of their origins of course\npossess some of the characteristics of handaxes. Al-\nthough they may therefore fortuitously resemble Le-\nvallois products, they still serve to reinforce the tech-\nnical fluidity of de\u00b4bitage and fac\u00b8onnage within\nprepared-core technology. India provides a further ex-\nample of its pedigree and diversity. At the Isampur\nQuarry in the Hunsgi Valley, Petraglia, Schuldenrein,\nand Korisettar (n.d.) describe \u201cprepared\u201d cores made on\nlarge boulders worked around their perimeters, designed,\nthey argue, to produce a large flake suitable for support-\ning a side-struck cleaver. Moreover, in the Malaprabha\nValley these researchers have described \u201ctransitional\u201d\nassemblages that show an unbroken flow from Lower\nPalaeolithic to Middle Palaeolithic technology. The shift\nis gradual, indicating that prepared cores have their roots\nin the local late Acheulean and that the transition from\nthe Lower Palaeolithic to the Middle Palaeolithic is a\ngradual one.\nLike most transitions, then, the emergence of pre-\npared-core technologies was probably a matter of short\nbursts of frenzied innovation and variation with frequent\n\u201cfailures\u201d and the eventual sedimentation and stasis of\na successful form (Gould 1989, Goren-Inbar and Belfer-\nCohen 1998). While the above examples nicely demon-\nstrate that Levallois technology is immanent in Acheu-\nlean knapping practices, they also call into question the\nidea that it always emerged directly from handaxe man-\nufacture as is widely presumed. The link lies in the prin-\nciples and concepts underlying tool manufacture, not\nnecessarily in the tools themselves; it is perhaps no sur-\nprise, then, that in areas that largely lacked these con-\ncepts (and by default show a paucity of the characteristic\ntools of the Acheulean, e.g., China [see Schick 1994])\nLevallois technology never fully developed (Gao and\nNorton 2002).\nThe emergence of Levallois technology in Europe is\nnot simply a restructuring of core technology. The tran-\nsition may also be marked by other (diachronous)\nchanges in technological practices. Although handaxes\nseem to be phased out in many areas as flake and flake\n606 F current anthropology\ntool production increase (see Goren-Inbar and Belfer-Co-\nhen 1998), in some areas they are retained at some level\nwhile in others (such as Germany) they actually increase\ndramatically. Moreover, those areas and phases that see\nthe continued production of handaxes also seem to wit-\nness changes in their basic functions. The growing evi-\ndence from use-wear and site association suggests that\nhandaxes in the Lower Palaeolithic are predominantly\nbutchery tools (Keeley 1980, Villa 1990, Mitchell 1995,\nAustin et al. 1999). The overall aim seems to be the\nproduction of sharp-edged, symmetrical cutting tools,\nwhere the edge and the volume of the piece form a uni-\nfied whole (Ashton and White 2001). In contrast, it has\nbeen suggested by Boe\u00a8da, Geneste, and Meignen (1990)\nand J. Goue\u00b4do (personal communication) that Middle Pa-\nlaeolithic bifaces should be understood through the dis-\ntinct concepts of volumetric shape (encompassing the\nprehensile qualities of the tool) and the specific func-\ntional edges of the tool. They argue that in some indus-\ntries (e.g., the Micoquian) bifaces had become the support\nfor other tools, contained different functional areas on\ndifferent edges of the same piece, and were the subject\nof resharpening. This flexibility in function has also been\nnoted by Turq (2000:207\u201311) and Soressi and Hays (2001)\non Middle Palaeolithic bifaces from France, where edges\nthat serve as scrapers and notches are imposed on bifaces\nor bifaces are converted into cores. As with the Levallois\nmethod, there seems to be a breakdown of the distinc-\ntions between fac\u00b8onnage and debitage, with tools once\nproduced from debitage now being produced as part of\nfac\u00b8onnage. As a result, technology becomes more flex-\nible.\nThe changes in lithic technology are accompanied by\na suite of wider changes related to the overall process of\nNeanderthalization. The lithic cha\u0131\u02c6ne ope\u00b4ratoire is ar-\nguably extended in time and space, involving greater mo-\nbility and higher levels of curation, with Levallois prod-\nucts being notably \u201cmobile\u201d (Geneste 1985, 1989;\nFe\u00b4blot-Augustins 1999). Geneste (1985, 1989) had dem-\nonstrated that in south-western France Levallois prod-\nucts often occur on raw materials showing longer trans-\nport distances, testifying to a greater degree of curation\nfor this technology. This has led White and Pettitt (1995)\nto argue that the Levallois was specifically a technology\ngeared towards greater mobility. These patterns are\npartly reflected in the overall distances of lithic transfers\nin the Middle Palaeolithic (Roebroeks, Kolen, and Ren-\nsink 1988), with distances of up to 120 km in western\nEurope and up to 300 km in eastern Europe. While the\ngeneral distribution and patterns of lithic transport in\nthe Lower Palaeolithic and the early Middle Palaeolithic\nare comparable, suggesting behavioural continuity (with\ngreater differences existing between the early and late\nMiddle Palaeolithic), they nevertheless show some evi-\ndence for a greater variety of movement and curation\n(Fe\u00b4blot-Augustins 1999). At the same time, from oxygen\nisotope stage 8\/7 there seems to be progressive adapta-\ntion of humans to more open and at times cooler con-\nditions, in particular the rich semi-arid environments of\nthe mammoth steppe (Ashton and Lewis 2002, Ashton\nn.d.; cf. Guthrie 1990). One effect may have been a shift\nin settlement patterns, with human populations surviv-\ning better on the mammoth steppes of the east in warmer\nphases, tracking the westward expansion of the steppic\nbiomes as climate cooled, and retreating to southern re-\nfugia during glacial extremes. Furthermore, the distri-\nbution and movement of herds in the more open land-\nscapes would have required greater mobility of human\npopulations and new strategies for dealing with the ex-\nploitation of such resources. This is reflected in the fau-\nnal record, with specialization in hunting noted increas-\ningly from stage 7 onward (Gaudzinski 1995, 1996, 1999;\nScott 1986; Jaubert et al. 1990; Stiner 2002).\nThese shifts in hunting specialization, mobility, and\nsettlement pattern were probably accompanied by\nchanges in group organization and size (Ashton and\nLewis 2002). Other than from the faunal record, changes\nin group size might also be recognizable at early Levallois\nsites. The richest sites tend to concentrate around\nsources of very abundant raw materials, and the very\ndense concentrations suggest either very frequent visits\nto key resources or exceptionally large gatherings. If the\nlatter, then the origins of Levallois technology might be\nunderwritten by changes in the way in which systems\nof flake production were used in the social sphere, per-\nhaps becoming more critical to the construction of social\nlife\u2014a role some believe was previously dominated by\nhandaxes (Kohn and Mithen 1999; cf. Gamble 1999).\nSuch an explanation might well help explain the elab-\noration of simple prepared cores into full Levallois prod-\nucts and the eventual sidelining of the handaxe. Given\nthe previous hundreds of thousands of years of stasis, in\nwhich innovation is muted and rarely sedimented, all of\nthis must be underwritten by changes in the mecha-\nnisms of social transmission (see Mithen 1994) and the\npower of agents to bring about lasting change in cultural\nstructures (Hopkinson and White n.d.). Taken together,\nthese show that the emergence of Levallois technology\ndoes not signal a simple technical shift to be explained\nin a monocausal fashion but is the lithic incarnation of\na multifaceted transformation in human societies and\ntheir organization at this time that may herald the evo-\nlution of the Neanderthals and their modes of action.\nconclusion\nThe simple prepared cores from Purfleet represent a\nproto-Levallois technology dating to oxygen isotope\nstage 9\/8. The cores demonstrate the employment of hi-\nerarchically organized surfaces separated by a plane of\nintersection and a volumetric core concept. This repre-\nsents an innovative conceptual leap whereby principles\npreviously limited to systems of fac\u00b8onnage are exapted\nto systems of debitage, presaging the development of the\nmore sophisticated and finely controlled Levallois meth-\nods of the later Middle Palaeolithic. For us it is this in-\ncorporation of difference (Hopkinson 2001), the fusion\nof principles taken from two distinct operational sys-\ntems, that characterizes the Middle Palaeolithic tech-\nnology, leading to far greater variation and flexibility in\nVolume 44, Number 4, August\u2013October 2003 F 607\nboth core reduction and tool production than that wit-\nnessed in the Lower Palaeolithic. This is not necessarily\nthe only route to Levallois technology, but it is one that\nmay have had many different expressions before finally\nbecoming integrated into the variety of techniques now\nrecognized. Most important, the examples cited give a\nstrong impression of continuity rather than abrupt\nchange in technical practices in Europe and a suite of\nassociated changes that are progressive rather than\nabrupt. This does not, of course, refute Foley and Lahr\u2019s\nsuggestion of an exclusive African origin, but it leads us\nto question the arrival in Europe of a fully developed\nsystem in the hands of a group of dispersing hominids\nequipped with the skill and knowledge to practice it. It\nis, however, interesting to note that when it finally takes\nhold the Levallois method appears to occur almost si-\nmultaneously across Europe, the Near East, and Africa.\nThis may well be a problem with the resolution of our\ndating, which through time averaging often contempor-\narizes events that are in reality separated by tens of\nthousands of years, but if real it shows that even if hom-\ninids were not moving, ideas and techniques were being\ntransmitted through extensive social networks of the\nsupposedly small and isolated human populations. The\norigins of Levallois technology and the changes that ac-\ncompanied it have remained a neglected area of research\nthat has cognitive, behavioural, and social implications\nand clearly warrants a global program of multidiscipli-\nnary investigation.\nReferences Cited\na d a m e n k o , o . m . , a n d e . v. g l a d i l i n e . 1989.
